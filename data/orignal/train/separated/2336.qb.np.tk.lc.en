for over a century , i have lived in secret ,
until now . i know the risk ,
but i have to know her .
as a founding family member ,
i find it &apos;s my duty to report some very distressing news .
he &apos;s a gilbert ?
elena &apos;s uncle .
mayor ... lockwood , is it ?
my name is pearl .
this is my daughter anna .
maybe there is such a thing as vampires .
they &apos;re just different from the way we always thought they were .
you got a problem with blood , anna ?
the coroner &apos;s office has officially ruled
vicki donovan &apos;s death a drug overdose .
so you don &apos;t think it was an overdose .
jer , just ... just let it go . ok ?
is there something you &apos;re not telling me ?
take my wrist . you need more blood .
i have this hunger inside of me that i &apos;ve never ...
i &apos;ve never felt before in my entire life ,
i don &apos;t want you to see me like this .
i don &apos;t want you to know that this side of me exists .
nice car .
i thought it was a waste
to leave it sitting in the garage .
i didn &apos;t know you were coming back today .
you know , i woke up this morning
and i was feeling great ,
and i figured it was time for me to get back into things .
does that mean you &apos;re ok now ?
with all the cravings ?
yeah . i mean , the worst part is over .
so ... now all i want to do
is just spend as much time with you as possible .
i &apos;m ok with that .
hey , thank you .
for helping me get through the ...
the rough patch .
you &apos;re welcome .
we &apos;re going to be late .
ok , um , you know what ,
i &apos;ll catch up with you . i &apos;m gonna grab my stuff .
i &apos;ll be right behind you .
there was a disturbance at the hospital blood bank last night .
some of the supply was compromised .
compromised ? you mean stolen .
we almost missed it .
the inventory records were altered ,
but when the night manager was questioned ,
he had no recollection of changing them .
meaning the vampire who stole the blood
used mind control to hide the theft .
i know what she meant .
we wouldn &apos;t have noticed if john not alerted us
to recent discrepancies
at other hospital blood banks in the county .
how lucky for us , we have john .
we &apos;re stepping up security at the hospital ,
giving the guards vervain
to prevent this from happening again .
sheriff , might i offer a suggestion ?
why don &apos;t damon and i put our heads together ?
we can track down whoever &apos;s doing this .
truthfully , i could use the extra hands .
is that something you &apos;d be willing to do ?
well , of course , i mean , if it &apos;ll help .
i think we &apos;ll make a good team .
don &apos;t you , damon ?
john , whatever i can do to help keep this town safe ,
even if it means spending time with you .
this week we &apos;re going to set aside our
regular curriculum for a lesson in local history
as we approach founder &apos;s day .
apparently the community leaders
feel that &apos;s more important than world war ii ,
but hey , what do i know ?
sorry i &apos;m late .
looks like we will be at full occupancy today .
welcome home , bonnie .
right , founder &apos;s day .
what does it mean to have a founder &apos;s day ?
well , if you &apos;ll turn your attention to this
exquisite diorama over here
that i spent all night ...
i suppose i should be grateful
you learned how to use the bell .
i &apos;m here on behalf of my mother .
on behalf of or in spite of ?
i &apos;m sorry about what the other vampires did to stefan .
abducting him , torturing him .
it wasn &apos;t supposed to go down like that .
you were playing house with half of a tomb
of really pissed off vampires .
what did you think was going to happen ?
my mom is devastated . they tried to overthrow her .
why isn &apos;t she here telling me this ?
she doesn &apos;t really do apologies .
well , that &apos;s a coincidence ,
&apos;cause i don &apos;t do forgiveness ,
so just run along .
and if you &apos;re going to continue
playing house with your little vampire pets ,
you might want to stop robbing the blood bank dry ,
because they &apos;re onto it .
i haven &apos;t been to the local blood bank in at least a week .
then it &apos;s one of your others .
the other ones are gone , damon .
well , where &apos;d they go ?
they weren &apos;t cut out for this town .
after what happened with your brother ,
my mom kicked them out and they took off .
it &apos;s just us and harper now .
bonnie .
hey , i , um , i tried to grab you after class
but you &apos;d already taken off .
how are you ? how &apos;s your family ?
we &apos;re dealing . it &apos;s been hard .
everyone here really missed you .
yeah , i just had so much to deal with
after grams &apos; funeral ,
and honestly
after you told me that the tomb &apos;s spell failed ,
i just didn &apos;t really want to come back .
i hope you understand why i called .
i wanted you to know before you came home .
yeah , i understand why . i just shouldn &apos;t know .
i know it &apos;s been really hard ...
bonnie !
bonnie ! thank god you &apos;re home !
i know we talked every day ,
but i missed you !
how are you doing ?
better . just better . you know ,
glad to be back ,
and try to keep myself busy .
well , i can help with that .
major wardrobe confab needed asap .
you need to help me pick the perfect dress for the founder &apos;s court .
the founder &apos;s court ? did i miss something ?
the founder &apos;s court .
you know , miss mystic falls .
they announced it today , and , um ,
you and are both on it .
oh , my god , we signed up for that so long ago .
i completely forgot .
so are you dropping out , then ?
i can &apos;t .
no ?
her mom is the one who wanted her to enter .
how was school ?
fine .
yeah ? same old , same old ?
nothing new ?
no stories to bring home ?
you &apos;re making small talk , why ?
you seem awfully chipper lately .
less doom and gloom , a little more pep in your step .
and you think it &apos;s because i drank human blood again .
i mean , i don &apos;t want to brag ,
but i would definitely take responsibility for this new and improved you .
well , i hate to burst your bubble ,
but i &apos;m clean .
yeah , not possible .
not only is it possible , but it is quite true .
stefan , let &apos;s be serious for a second .
you spent the last century and a half
being a poster child for prozac ,
and now you expect me to believe that
this new you has nothing to do with human blood , nothing .
i &apos;m clean .
you &apos;re lying !
believe what you want .
i &apos;m sorry for the short notice .
i didn &apos;t even know that the contest was coming up ,
much less that i would be in it .
well , i &apos;ll be happy to escort you anywhere .
my mom was really into this founder &apos;s day stuff .
she was even miss mystic in her day .
i kinda wanted to do it for her .
well , it &apos;ll be great .
we &apos;ll have fun .
ok . i &apos;ll see tomorrow . i love you .
love you , too .
he &apos;s a liar and a thief .
when were you going to share ?
go ahead .
help yourself .
no , no , i &apos;m talking about
the fact that you &apos;re a closet blood junky .
so i &apos;m drinking blood again .
you &apos;re the one that shoved it on me .
what &apos;s your problem ?
i have it under control .
under control ?
you robbed the hospital .
so what &apos;s your point ?
fine . whatever , man . drink up .
just remember we &apos;re trying to keep a low profile .
why don &apos;t you just walk up to sheriff forbes ,
ask her to tap a vein .
have my actions negatively impacted you ?
ooh . i can &apos;t imagine what that must feel like .
yeah , what &apos;s elena think about the new ... you ?
noing &apos;s changed . i &apos;m still the same person .
clearly .
elena doesn &apos;t need to know anything yet .
you &apos;ve been off the human stuff for years , stefan .
if you &apos;re having trouble controlling ...
i &apos;m not having any trouble .
who do you think you &apos;re talking to ?
i know what it &apos;s like .
that jekyll and hyde feeling .
there &apos;s that switch , sometimes it goes off and you snap .
right now is not a good time for me
to be worried about you snapping .
i know that it pains you to see this .
but i &apos;m fine , ok ?
i &apos;m fine .
so please , do me a favor .
and back off .
this year &apos;s queen will have
the special honor of taking center stage at the 150th founders &apos; day gala .
before we crown our winner ,
we &apos;d like to get to know a bit more about each of you .
i &apos;m on the m.f. beautification committee .
i volunteer at the rec center soup kitchen .
i recognize that i haven &apos;t been
as involved this year as i used to be .
i implemented this year &apos;s go green campaign at school .
i &apos;ve been distracted , and i let a lot of things slide .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s wrong for me to win 2 years in a row .
i was surprised to have been selected .
since i &apos;m not from one of the founding families .
but i &apos;m aware of what an honor this is ,
and i want you to know that i take it seriously .
worked with the county &apos;s recycling program
and was in charge of the policemen &apos;s yearly raffle .
just because my dui made my community service mandatory ,
doesn &apos;t mean i was any less committed .
this was really important to my mother .
she believed in community ,
family , honor and loyalty .
it &apos;s the legacy she left for me .
hey , partner .
what do you want ?
you haven &apos;t returned any of my calls .
most people take that as a hint .
why don &apos;t we start looking for vampires ?
why the act , john ?
i mean , you obviously don &apos;t care about catching vampires ,
since you &apos;re here talking to me .
actually , i care very much .
what did isobel say about that ?
i mean , considering that she is one .
isobel and i share a mutual interest .
the original johnathan gilbert had an invention
that was stolen by a vampire .
that vampire was then burned alive
in fell &apos;s church , or so johnathan thought .
and the invention was lost forever .
but then the vampires weren &apos;t killed , were they ?
they were trapped .
and now they &apos;re free , thanks to you ,
which means the invention is retrievable .
well , what is it ?
the only thing that matters is that i want it back ,
and you &apos;re going to help me if you want your secret safe .
i mean , why bring me into it , john ?
i mean , i don &apos;t even know what you &apos;re talking about ,
much less who has it .
oh , come on , damon .
you were around back then .
you know who these people are , what they look like .
he was friendly with a woman
who turned out to be a vampire .
her name was pearl .
does that ring a bell ?
i &apos;m not playing anymore .
get out .
get out .
i beg your pardon ?
you know , i only entertain
this whole blackmail scheme thing of yours
because i thought that you and isobel could lead me to katherine .
but see , now i know you have no idea where katherine is ,
because if you did , you would know
that katherine and pearl
were best friends .
see , you don &apos;t know everything ,
do you , john ?
i &apos;ll tell the entire council what you are .
go for it . i &apos;ll kill every last one of them .
then i &apos;ll sever your hand , pull your ring off ,
and i &apos;ll kill you , too .
do you understand that ?
honor your partner .
let &apos;s focus . right hand around .
flirt with your eyes .
left hand around .
this is ridiculous .
both hands .
you &apos;re only saying that
because you don &apos;t know how to do it .
sorry only one of us was around
when the dance was invented .
oh , no , no , no , no .
there &apos;s no touching during this part .
it &apos;s about the simple intimacy of the near @-@ touch .
very nice , amber .
thank you , mrs. lockwood !
if you ask me , the near touch is overrated .
you seem to be in a good mood .
is that a bad thing ?
would you prefer me to be brooding and tortured ?
hey , i &apos;m not complaining .
oh , no touching .
the fell cousins don &apos;t have a shot .
and amber bradley is only on the court
so the pageant doesn &apos;t look like it &apos;s founding families only .
which , of course , it is .
so that leaves elena .
she totally has the sympathy vote since her parents died .
how can i compete with that ?
very nice .
very sensitive .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . this must sound
really unimportant in light of everything .
it &apos;s ok . i get it .
you want to win .
well , my grandmother was miss mystic .
and both of my aunts .
my mom &apos;s the only one who didn &apos;t get the gene ,
and i want this .
i mean , i actually deserve this .
bonnie .
how are you ?
i begged bonnie to fill in for matt .
he had to work today .
bonnie , do you have a minute ?
we only have 30 minutes for rehearsal .
it &apos;ll only take a minute .
please ?
bonnie , you have to tell me what &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s not worth talking about .
what do you mean , not worth it ?
you &apos;ve barely said 10 words to me ,
and you won &apos;t even look at stefan .
is that what it is , is it stefan ?
listen .
elena , i can &apos;t just pretend
like everything is okey .
everything my gram did was to protect us
from those vampires in the tomb .
and now they &apos;re out ,
which means she died for nothing .
i &apos;m so sorry , bonnie .
what can i do to make it better ?
that &apos;s just it .
there &apos;s nothing you can do .
i blame him , elena .
him and damon .
and i &apos;m not going to put you in a situation
where you have to choose sides .
i was having a hard time with it .
okey ?
dude , are you ok ? you &apos;re bleeding .
ahh , stefan !
are you ok ?
yes . i &apos;m sorry .
i was just ...
i was feeling a little sick .
i &apos;ll be fine .
i heard you &apos;re driving .
yeah , i am .
let me get that for you .
thanks .
yeah .
um , how , uh ...
how is stefan ?
what do you mean ?
you know , he seems on edge .
he went through a lot ,
he was in bad shape for a while .
but he &apos;s bouncing back now .
alaric .
hey , buddy . what are you doing here ?
well , i &apos;m the chauffer .
oh , i thought i was driving .
oh , no need .
we &apos;re going with rick .
are we ready ?
jeremy can ride with you .
in the running for miss mystic falls ?
sometimes you have to wear uncomfortable heels
to blend in .
i remember this event from 1864 .
i was supposed to enter ,
before everything happened .
ahh , nostalgia &apos;s a bitch .
if you &apos;re just going to mock me ,
then you move along , please .
john gilbert thinks your mom stole an artifact
from johnathan sr. sr. back in 1864 .
what are you , his errand boy ?
i don &apos;t know what it is ,
but i don &apos;t want him to have it .
i could ask her .
but , you know , you &apos;ve made it pretty clear
that you don &apos;t trust us ,
so why should i even bother ?
because you want to stay in mystic falls ,
and john gilbert &apos;s in town ,
making that impossible .
find out where it is .
he leaves , you can buy a welcome mat .
thanks for helping me .
don &apos;t thank me
until you &apos;re sure your hair isn &apos;t going to burn off .
you know , i remember
when my mom and i were first applying for this .
she was so excited .
so were you , if i recall .
i was .
she just made it sound like so much fun .
lots has changed since then .
well , i hate to break it to you ,
but it &apos;s a little late for cold feet .
i don &apos;t have cold feet . i just ...
i think i &apos;d be enjoying it a lot more if she was here .
i &apos;ll tell you one thing ,
your hair would have a better chance if she was .
ok , i should go put my dress on .
be careful with that thing .
don &apos;t hurt anybody .
you look miserable .
are there really a whole month of these events
that i &apos;m supposed to show up at ?
you can fight it if you want ,
but it &apos;s part of being a gilbert .
yeah , you , uh , you mentioned you know a lot about the family .
do you know anything
about our ancestor johnathan gilbert ?
prolific writer , crazy inventor .
why do you ask ?
well , i read his journal .
is that right ?
yeah .
i actually found it in all dad &apos;s stuff .
well , that &apos;s surprising .
most of them are locked away .
there &apos;s more of them ?
johnathan gilbert journaled his whole life .
right down to the bitter , insane drunken end .
guy had a lot of demons .
and did you read &apos; em ?
i browsed , yeah .
what &apos;d you think about what he wrote ?
crazy ramblings of a mad man , of course .
well , she &apos;s very pretty .
yeah , yeah , she &apos;s a , uh ,
a friend of mine . excuse me .
are you ok , amber ?
i hate being the center of attention .
i get panic attacks .
do you need some privacy so you can change ?
actually , i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m just going to go get some air .
you can &apos;t be back here .
we need to talk .
does it have to be right now ?
normally i would have a completely different outlook
on what i &apos;m about to tell you ,
but since it could really inconvenience me ,
i &apos;ll squeal .
what are you talking about ?
stefan &apos;s still drinking human blood .
what ?
yeah .
a month ago , i would have rejoiced .
but with the council back on the alert ,
it is not a good time for stefan to fly off the handle .
i know he &apos;s been a little edgy ,
but he said that was normal .
he has a fridge full of stolen blood bank contraband
in the house .
oh , my god .
he has no idea what normal is .
his entire existence isn &apos;t normal .
normal to a vampire is drinking human blood .
but he spent all this time fighting it
when he should have been learning how to control it .
and now it &apos;s controlling him instead .
i can &apos;t believe this .
i mean , it &apos;s stefan that we &apos;re talking about here .
stefan on human blood , elena .
he &apos;ll do anything , he &apos;ll say anything ,
because he &apos;s not going to want to stop .
trust me .
anna !
what is it ?
come on , don &apos;t be like that .
why not ?
you &apos;re basically using me to turn you into a vampire
so you could be with someone else .
no , i wasn &apos;t using you .
really ?
then how would you like to define it ?
look , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s any worse
than becoming friends with me
so you could give your mother my blood .
how do you know that ?
that &apos;s not important .
seriously , jeremy .
what do you know ?
everything . i know everything .
this is all my fault .
i &apos;m the one who fed him the blood in the first place .
what &apos;s going on in here ?
just filling elena in
on your extracurricular activities .
what are you talking about ?
i know about the blood , stefan .
i &apos;m gonna ... i &apos;ll be downstairs ,
drinking .
i was going to tell you .
when ?
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine . the blood , it doesn &apos;t change anything .
it &apos;s changing you .
why , because i kept it a secret from you ?
come on , elena .
look , given the way that you &apos;re reacting right now ,
can you really blame me for doing that ?
are you hearing yourself right now ?
you &apos;ve been stealing blood and lying ,
and you say that everything &apos;s fine ?
everything &apos;s not fine , stefan .
so what , so you and damon
all of a sudden have everythgg figured out then ?
it &apos;s not about damon .
it &apos;s about what &apos;s happening to you .
i know , and i &apos;m telling you that i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine .
please , come on .
elena , i thought you ...
i thought you believed in me .
elena ? let &apos;s go . the line up &apos;s starting .
i just ...
i need a minute .
you &apos;re not even dressed yet .
escorts wait downstairs , stefan .
god !
oh , god , sorry !
ms. tina fell ,
escorted by bartholomew whitmore .
has anyone seen amber ?
do you see stefan down there ?
nope .
just my boring fill @-@ in escort .
what happened to matt ?
they wouldn &apos;t let him out of work .
hey , what happened to stefan ?
i don &apos;t know . he just disappeared somewhere .
i don &apos;t know .
what am i doing ?
i never should have gone through with this .
what do you mean ?
i need to find stefan .
this isn &apos;t me . i &apos;m not this person anymore .
uh , no , no , no , no way , no .
you had your chance to drop out .
and believe me , i was all for it .
because there is no way that i can beat you .
elena , you &apos;re doing this because
it was important to your mom .
ms. caroline forbes ,
and her escort jeffrey lockwood hamilton .
elena , you &apos;re next . come on .
you &apos;re missing elena &apos;s introduction .
i don &apos;t care .
so she has no idea you read her journal ?
she keeps things from me ,
i &apos;m going to keep things from her .
what are you going to do now ?
now that you know everything
that she &apos;s been hiding from you ?
i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s a part of me that &apos;s so angry , you know ,
that she covered up what happened to vickie
and erased my memory ,
but there &apos;s this other part of me that &apos;s glad .
i ...
i don &apos;t want to remember vickie like that .
as a monster ?
no , as someone who wanted to hurt me .
when i met you ,
you were just a part of my plan to get my mother back .
but then things changed .
all the time we spent together ,
i would never do anything to hurt you .
not now .
you know that , right ?
yeah , i know that .
where are we going ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m in the ceremony .
not now , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re standing in the parking lot with me .
i &apos;m in the parking lot with you .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m not very good to be around right now .
i &apos;m a little bit on edge .
i &apos;ve ... i &apos;ve been drinking the human stuff
and it &apos;s really screwing with my head .
oh ! she knows now .
god , she wasn &apos;t supposed to find out .
i didn &apos;t want her to find out , now everything &apos;s ruined .
you seem sad .
i &apos;m not sad !
i &apos;m freaking hungry !
ms. elena gilbert ,
escorted by mr. stefan salvatore .
where &apos;s stefan ?
i don &apos;t know .
what is she doing with damon ?
i have no idea .
what are we going to do ?
right now we just have to get through this .
i don &apos;t hurt people .
i don &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m the good brother .
do you want to hurt me ?
i want to kill you .
i want to rip into your skin ,
and i want to feed on your blood .
under your skin ,
pulsating , flowing .
your carotid artery , right there .
if you puncture this just right ,
you can control the blood flow .
it takes practice ,
but it doesn &apos;t have to make a mess .
you don &apos;t have to waste any .
what &apos;s stopping you ?
if i do this ,
if i give in , there &apos;s no going back .
then don &apos;t .
i just want one taste .
that &apos;s all i need . just one more taste .
one taste ?
where &apos;s amber ?
i don &apos;t know .
before i crown the winner ,
i &apos;d like to offer a personal thank you
to all of these young ladies for their efforts
to better our communities .
so , without further adieu ,
it is my honor to announce
our very own miss mystic falls ,
ms. caroline forbes !
congratulations !
i actually won !
there is blood on the glass .
get me damon salvatore .
i can &apos;t do this !
what &apos;s the matter ?
i can &apos;t do this .
it &apos;s ok .
it doesn &apos;t hurt that much .
just not so hard next time .
oh , god , oh , god , oh , god .
i can &apos;t stop .
i can &apos;t stop .
why aren &apos;t you afraid of me , huh ?
you told me not to be .
what ?
what &apos;s your name ?
amber .
listen to me , amber .
i need you to be afraid of me .
i need you to run like hell ,
do you understand me ?
run , run , now !
what is it , did you find him ?
there were signs of struggle in the upstairs bathroom .
there was blood .
and that amber girl is missing .
oh , my god .
he wouldn &apos;t hurt her .
he won &apos;t .
let &apos;s just find him , ok ?
let &apos;s get your coat , come on .
you said to run !
i changed my mind .
stefan ! oh !
stefan .
come on . get control of it . come on .
it &apos;s ok . come on .
breathe through it , man .
stefan , stop it !
it &apos;s ok .
stefan .
she doesn &apos;t remember what happened .
it &apos;s a good thing the girls got here when they did .
she lost a lot of blood .
you didn &apos;t see anything ?
no . we just found her
and then called damon .
she gonna be ok ?
looks like it , yeah .
why don &apos;t you girls get back to the party .
damon and i can take it from here .
yeah .
ok .
they didn &apos;t see the bite mark ?
no , i got here before they got too close .
there was too much blood , they couldn &apos;t see it clearly .
bonnie , can we talk about this ?
there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
bonnie , please .
i told you i wasn &apos;t going to make you choose ,
but i need to make the choice for myself .
please just leave me alone .
jer .
you ready ?
uh , just a second .
who &apos;s that girl with jeremy ?
his friend anna .
what &apos;s her story ?
why so nosy ?
i &apos;m just curious . he really seems to like her .
she &apos;s new in town , i think .
she and her mom , pearl .
the family you &apos;re so rudely trying to prevent
from buying grayson &apos;s building .
her mother &apos;s name is pearl ?
yes , so ?
well , i believe i already know all about her .
oh , good , there you are . jenna wanted me to get the car .
what happened ?
all right , now this is getting weird .
we &apos;re here to talk .
i &apos;m not in the mood .
today &apos;s been a no @-@ good , very bad day .
annabelle tells me you &apos;re looking for something
i took from jonathan gilbert .
i &apos;m listening .
what is that ?
jonathan was passionate about his inventions .
he confided in me that
he had created a detection device
meant to track down the town &apos;s vampire element .
it was a pocket watch .
that &apos;s what it turned out to be , yes .
but that &apos;s not what i stole .
i discovered my mistake when i saw the watch
in jonathan &apos;s hand
the night they took us .
its dial pointed at me .
so what is this ?
i have no idea .
but now it &apos;s yours .
what &apos;s the catch ?
there &apos;s no catch .
my daughter wants to stay here .
i want to stay here .
you refuse to trust us , and for good reason .
consider this an apology .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
i know .
now you know .
that wasn &apos;t you .
oh , it was absolutely me .
i &apos;m a monster , a predator .
it &apos;s who i am , elena .
that &apos;s what the blood makes you .
the blood brings out what &apos;s inside of me .
if you think of me differently , then you are an idiot .
i know this isn &apos;t you , stefan .
i wanted to drain ,
every ounce of blood from that girl &apos;s body .
