Nolan Ross' secrets are somewhere in that house.
I trusted you.
Get out of my house.
You can work when you want.
You can bring Carl with you.
Or you can keep inhaling sawdust off the floor at Mcginty's.
I can start tonight.
What will you do with all the money coming your way?
I'll use it to ensure that the Daniel Grayson foundation
restores my boy's good name.
If you go to war with Emily,
no good can come of it.
So move forward for you and your child.
It is for the two of us that I must do this.
Jack Porter was taken care of.
Good.
You know me. I wouldn't drink and get behind the wheel.
You blew a .14.
No, no, no! You're not taking him!
You're not taking my kid!
You're not taking my kid!
Daddy!
Whoa, whoa! What's going on?
No, no, no! You're not taking him!
Get your hands off my daughter!
Let him go!
Let him go! Give him to me!
Buddy...
I'm sorry.
I dozed off for a second.
How's your breakfast?
Let's get you out of there.
You miss your daddy, don't you?
Well, maybe he'll settle for yours.
Carl, look what I have.
What's that?
I know.
Yeah.
I don't know how you did it.
Well, I had a lot of practice.
His crying keep you up all night?
That and the thought
of him being taken away from his father.
If Jack's convicted, he'll face up to five years in prison
because Carl was in the car.
Jack, uh, he said that he was a little off-kilter recently,
but he would never do something this reckless, right?
There you go, buddy. Yeah.
He's being framed.
Who would do something like that?
I don't know.
Margaux's been coming after me,
but I can't imagine her retaliating like that with Jack.
Tearing a child away from a parent is unforgivable.
Whoever's doing this is gonna pay.
Listen, I know this hits close to home,
but making someone pay... that's not the way to deal with it.
It's the only way.
I am done seeing terrible things happen to my friends.
I'm handling it.
Amanda, we...
I'll be back after the bail hearing.
Thanks for watching him.
Hey, Carl. You want to play with the cab?
There you go.
At least someone in this family listens to me.
Really, Schaefer? Cuffs?
You're a familiar face around here, Porter.
Without them,
someone might mistake you for a law-abiding civilian.
What is your problem?
My blood test will prove that I wasn't drinking.
Wrong again.
The lab lost your sample.
They lost my sample?
I'm being set up, man.
Save it for your lawyer.
I don't have a lawyer!
043.
Mom?
Hi, Jack.
What are you doing here?
Emily flew me in last night.
Come in.
Or should I say "Amanda"?
She told you everything?
An abridged version.
The full story will have to wait,
since we have more pressing issues.
A D.U.I. with a child in the car...
Is a felony. I know.
What am I gonna do?
We're gonna fight it.
But I need to know... were you drinking?
I didn't have a drop.
You have to believe me.
I do.
Because I know what it looks like to lie about it,
which means that we have the truth on our side.
Now we just have to find it.
How are you feeling?
Okay. And you?
I guess congratulations are in order.
Oh, you heard about the inheritance.
No, but that's the dress
we're putting on the cover of "Voulez's" September issue,
and it's only July.
Well, it's a small gift to myself.
But I have another one for you and the baby.
The architect finished your vision.
The Daniel Grayson research wing.
It's magnificent, Victoria.
Countless lives will be saved in his name if it's approved.
That explains the hospital board meeting on my schedule today.
And the knot in my stomach.
I know that St. Joseph's is in dire need of my donation,
but the board is still struggling with the idea
of naming it after Daniel.
They are, but you've made a lot of headway,
and I assure you that I will sway any remaining naysayers.
Thank you.
The groundbreaking will be the perfect moment
to announce your pregnancy.
Defining Daniel as a philanthropist and a father
is sure to turn the tide.
Good morning.
Is this your mom?
I'm the baby's grandmother.
Oh, it's nice to have you.
Are we expecting anyone else?
It's just the two of us.
All right, then.
If you relax, I'm gonna tilt you back a bit.
Now, if your baby is cooperating,
we should have an image in just a second.
That's the heartbeat.
And there's your baby.
Morning.
You startled me.
Sorry.
What is all that?
Big daddy's magic hangover cure --
Since Lyman was four sheets to the wind last night.
Do you know if he's awake yet?
No. No idea.
Got a call from Emily this morning.
Jack's in trouble.
Oh, no. I hope it's not too serious.
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.
I-I got to get over there,
but I will, uh -- I'll check in later.
Ben.
Is everything all right?
Hi, Nolan.
This is officer Tupperman.
We need to speak with your wife.
Okay. Of course.
Uh, Louise!
Lou-lou?
Come in.
Oh, darling, this is very sweet,
but you know I prefer firemen.
No offense, boys.
Ms. Ellis, I'm afraid I have some bad news.
A body was found on the beach below these bluffs this morning.
His I.D. confirms that it was your brother.
Oh, my god.
Not guilty, your honor.
Let the record show that the defendant has entered a plea of "Not guilty."
Now on to the matter at hand.
Mr. Easton?
One cannot put a price on the safety of a child, your honor,
and we believe that Jack Porter is a flight risk.
Therefore, we recommend bail set at $50,000.
Your honor, not only is Jack Porter a loving father,
he's also a decorated law-enforcement officer
with lifelong ties to this very county.
I move that he be released on his own recognizance.
I will never unduly separate a child from their parent.
And because this is his first offense, I'm releasing him.
But, Mr. Porter, I'm appointing a social worker
to assess your competence as a father.
And I will not hesitate to take custody away
if these proceedings find you unfit.
We'll start tomorrow at 2:00 P.M.
She's sending a social worker?
Jack, I expected this.
Judge Knowles is just flexing her muscles
because she's facing a tough re-election.
We'll beat this.
Margaux, how could you?
Jack could lose carl.
Can't you see that? Have a heart.
That's close enough.
This is between you and me.
You leave Jack out of it.
Emily, you started this.
Whatever happens to Jack is on your hands.
So, you were with your brother
at the 4th of July party last night?
Yes.
Lyman had a few too many, so...
I sent him home to sleep it off, but...
when I got back, he wasn't asleep.
What was he doing?
He was drinking.
He finished off your Dalmore.
And I scolded him for being such a bad houseguest
and I sent him to bed.
I figured he passed out.
And did you see Lyman after that?
No.
And now I'll never see him again.
I know that this is difficult. I'm sorry.
I just have a couple more questions.
I understand you and your brother
had a strained relationship.
We were working to repair it.
Ask anyone who saw us at the party.
We were finally getting along.
Sure, but I know how it can be with an older brother.
One minute, you're smiling, the next --
Okay, Louise did get into a fight last night, but with me.
She wanted her brother to stay. I didn't.
If anyone had a problem with Lyman ellis,
you are looking at him.
I tell you what. Why don't we wrap up for now,
pick up again later at the station
when things have calmed down?
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
Oh. Alexander. There you are.
Shall I do the honors?
I'm afraid that would be premature.
Your proposal for Daniel's wing was denied.
One member couldn't see past your son's... reputation.
Tell me who thought it prudent
to deny a $40-million project with a single vote.
You know the voting's anonymous, Victoria.
And you also knew
that overcoming Daniel's... situation would be difficult.
Even I didn't make my peace with it
until I realized how many people your generosity will help.
Which is why I'd like to help change that one renegade mind.
I'm trying to narrow it down to a few potential members.
Do any of these jump out at you?
What are these names on the bottom?
Honorary members.
They're not required to participate,
but I believe one took part today.
Is that so?
She wants to destroy me
so she's going after my friends to do it --
First with Ben, and now...
This is a far cry from the Margaux I knew last year.
She's angry that we were forced to lie about Daniel's death.
Well, whatever her reasons,
Margaux would need someone on the inside to pull this off.
Wouldn't surprise me at all
if Schaefer was on the take and he ditched my blood sample.
Well, I'll check his bank account
for any large deposits of euros.
I'm seeing Ben tonight.
I'll try to convince him
to discredit Schaefer's character on the stand.
I'm not sure Officer Hunter will be much help,
considering his eyewitness account of Jack's arrest.
"Hostile"?
He said that you got physical
and refused to comply with the officer's demands.
I can't believe Ben would do this.
I can.
It's the truth. I was hostile.
I saw them take Carl away, and I-I lost it.
All we have to do is focus on debunking the D.U.I.,
And everything else will fall away.
Now, the breathalyzer...either Schaefer rigged it,
which, from what I've seen, he doesn't have the brains,
or...
Or someone spiked my O.J.
Nolan, do you have the sec...
Security footage of the bar? Already on it.
Right there.
He was at the courthouse with Margaux.
And look.
My glass clearly moved. He must have slipped something into it.
Can we use this in court?
In support of a theory,
but I still need material evidence.
Well, I have no other camera angles.
Then we have to track this guy down
so I can get us what we need.
That's enough.
What did you put in Jack Porter's drink?
Is that really what you want?
I really want to shoot you in the head
for what you did to my friend.
But I'll settle for you turning yourself in
and telling them Margaux was behind this whole thing.
I can do you one better.
Porter's blood sample.
Hard evidence he wasn't drinking.
Hand it over.
Whatever you say.
She lives.
Latte, chocolate scone, and an apology for last night.
It's all good. I figured you were working late on Jack's case.
Well, something like that.
Look in the bag.
What the hell is this?
You blow off dinner so you could help Nolan
make a duplicate of Jack's blood?
It's the real sample. I found it on Margaux's guy.
He must have stolen it from the lab
after somebody gave him access.
Who? Schaefer?
I never liked that guy,
but I doubt he's capable of this.
I didn't think that Margaux was capable of doing
what she's doing to Jack, but people surprise you.
The seal's intact, but you're gonna have a hard time
getting this submitted into evidence.
Stevie assured me that she could do it,
but the sample has to be found in the lab
as if it was misplaced.
Emily, I'm days away from making detective.
If I get caught trying to...
They're gonna take Carl away.
Looks like Carl's room has everything except Carl.
I'd like to meet him if I could.
Where is he?
Oh, he's spending the day with his grandpa.
As in David Clarke?
The very one.
Isn't it just amazing what he's been through?
Not exactly the descriptor I'd use
for someone held captive and tortured for two decades.
You're not concerned leaving Carl in his care?
No. No, not at all.
You wouldn't be either if you met him.
And where are they right now?
They're probably at the park at Montauk beach.
Probably?
So, I see here you just started a new job as a bartender.
Yeah, uh, South Hampton Beach Club.
The hours are flexible.
They have childcare when I'm working.
So your preferred supervision is at a bar?
Do you or anyone in your family have issues with alcohol?
I'm a recovering alcoholic, but Jack's never had a problem.
I'm sure it can get overwhelming being a single father.
You must have a drink every now and then.
I know what you're implying,
but I assure you I never drive when I do.
Look, this... this whole thing's
just a horrible misunderstanding.
That's not for me to decide, Mr. Porter.
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have any concerns.
Look, Carl already lost his mother.
Please don't take his father away from him, too.
I'll be in touch.
I need a new place to stay.
Emily?
Got the jump on me. Had to give her the blood sample.
No wonder Victoria begged me to give up this fight.
She knows how far Emily's willing to go.
She took him out, too.
Lyman left me a message the night he died.
It could lead back to me.
I'll clear any record of the call.
Then that will be your final task.
For your services.
You're giving up?
A man is dead because of me.
This is not who I am.
Thank you for your loyalty.
I am loyal to the Lemarchal name,
which will lose all credibility
if the heir to its throne is believed to be
the child of a monster.
I...
Your baby, Pascal's grandchild, deserves better.
That's why you started this, remember?
I think it's time we took that step to end this
before she does.
If you've done it right,
the system should be resetting now.
It worked. Thanks.
I wonder what tripped it.
Have you found anything
connecting Schaefer to Margaux yet?
No. Nothing.
But does it matter?
Once they see that Jack's blood test
would make Joseph Smith proud,
They've got to drop the charges, right?
Yeah, well, Schaefer's still an incompetent bully
who went after Jack.
Of course.
Well, you mess with Emily, you get the thorns.
I hope you don't mind.
That you broke into my house?
Well, I walked up from the beach.
I didn't want to interrupt your call.
Well, how kind of you.
Now get out.
Oh, trust me... this is the last place I want to be.
Daniel gave his life for you in that very spot.
And yet you continue to spit on his grave.
What are you talking about?
Were you the one who voted down
my proposal for the wing in his honor?
Daniel saved my life.
I owe him, which is why I took the time
to vote in favor of your idea.
I'm holding to our truce, Victoria.
I don't want any more loss.
Neither do I.
Then tell Margaux to leave Jack and Carl alone.
She is doing everything she can to tear that family apart.
Oh, Margaux.
What's left of her family is nothing but rubble.
She's in mourning.
Well, she's got a really screwed-up way
of dealing with it.
Take care of her, or I will.
Spoken like a true pacificist.
Nolan Ross?
Depends who's asking.
Tony Hughes. I'm a social worker for the state.
Wow. Good-looking and a good heart.
In that case, yes, I am Nolan Ross.
And can I interest you in a tour of my club?
I'm here about Jack Porter.
Oh, of course.
Didn't realize.
What?
That a full bar isn't an appropriate place
for a child to spend his nights?
I'm just trying to help a friend.
By setting up an unlicensed daycare facility?
You broke the law before he did.
Okay, I'll be on the phone with my lawyers
and I'll have a license by the end of this meeting.
Must be nice to buy your way out of trouble.
It's a lot nicer than ripping kids away
from their parents for a living.
A mother that tends towards addiction,
David Clarke, and you...
not exactly the village it takes.
I think I've heard all I need to.
And just so you're clear,
what I do for a living is protect children.
Well, where were you when my father
kicked me out of the house
because he caught me with a boy?
A lot of kids need protection.
Carl Porter is not one of them.
I wish my father had cared for me
with the love and devotion that Jack has for his son.
So, if you have any other questions,
you know where to find me.
How would you describe Mr. Porter
when you pulled him over?
He seemed anxious, and I smelled alcohol.
So I gave him a breathalyzer.
He blew .14.
Which is considerably above the .08 limit.
Thank you.
Officer Schaefer, the alcohol that you smelled --
Sure it was on my client's breath?
Not exactly. No.
So it could have been from
an eight-hour bartending shift, right?
I guess so.
But like I said, he seemed very anxious.
Most drivers are when they're pulled over,
especially when they've done nothing wrong.
Objection. Counsel is testifying.
Sustained.
The margin of error for a breathalyzer test is 50%.
That's why my client demanded a blood test.
What did the results say?
The sample vanished.
Our lab is overworked, and sometimes things get lost.
And sometimes they are found.
Your Honor, you and the prosecution are aware
that my client's blood sample
was discovered by the lab this morning.
I move that it be admitted into evidence and tested.
I will not allow it,
as the sample has been open to contamination.
The lab assured me that it was merely misplaced
and the protective seal is unbroken.
The lab...
The lab couldn't possibly confirm that, Your Honor.
I agree with Mr. Easton.
My decision stands.
Are we clear?
No, Your Honor.
Precedent has been set in both the state v. Robinson...
...and v. Mendez.
I am warning you, counselor.
All due respect... - It will not be admitted.
Why should the state's error prejudice my client?
That is it!
I am holding you in contempt of court.
Bailiff, would you please escort Ms. Grayson to holding?
It'll be okay, Jack.
Mr. Porter.
I recommend finding yourself some new representation.
Court is adjourned.
Thank you.
And now you can take me to my son.
Jack's at home with Carl.
David?
You posted my bail?
20 years ago, you tried to help get me out of prison.
Thought it's time I returned the favor.
You ready to go?
One of my greatest regrets is not being capable
of helping you when you were at your lowest
because I was at mine.
I'm sorry I failed you.
You didn't.
There was so much more to the conspiracy
that neither of us knew about.
The only one that could have saved me was the one who did.
Your daughter's very impressive.
She is.
From everything I heard,
you're pretty impressive yourself.
I have to be for Jack, but you understand that.
You and I have both been given second chances with our kids.
You're right. It's great.
It's harder than I expected.
Can't make up for those missing years.
Emily's already this full person.
She doesn't need her dad anymore.
I showed up, but... too late.
No. It's never too late.
If I believed that, I never would have met Jack.
David, you can't give up.
Emily may not know it now, but she still needs her father.
And you have to be there when she does.
We need to find a way to discredit Schaefer's testimony.
Well, I've already been through his phone records,
his bank accounts, and his tax returns.
The only thing dirty about officer Schaefer
is his browser history.
Then we have to show Judge Knowles
the surveillance video of James Allen at the bar
and hope she changes her mind about my blood.
Won't work.
Mind's already made up.
What are you saying?
I've never been held in contempt.
Judge Knowles went above and beyond to silence me.
You're saying that she's in Margaux's pocket, not Schaefer?
Oh, it explains her reaction to exculpatory evidence.
And she's up for re-election.
Do a news search for Judge Knowles.
Yeah, got it.
Leanne Knowles... get this...
was just officially endorsed
by the New York Ledger, Journal, and Tribune.
And a bunch of others.
What's the connection?
They're all Lemarchal publications.
What do you think?
It's very generous, Victoria.
Merci.
I'm afraid I went overboard at the boutique today.
I needed some cheering up...
... after my proposal was voted down.
Yes, about that, um...
It was you who voted against Daniel's wing.
Why the sudden change of heart?
Oh, it was not my heart.
It was my child's.
I heard it beating, and...
every fiber of my being felt compelled to protect it.
Well, that's your maternal instinct,
but I still don't understand.
I realized that announcing my pregnancy
in conjunction with the wing,
while Daniel's name is still in tatters,
would cast a shadow over my child's life
before it's even begun.
I just want to keep my baby safe.
I understand.
I'm still trying to do the same thing for my baby.
Daniel's heart may no longer beat,
but my maternal instinct will never let him go.
If you want to keep your pregnancy quiet,
I will support you.
Because your child is his legacy.
Then I will support your vision and change my vote.
We may not agree on how to redeem Daniel's name,
but we want the same thing...
what is best for his child.
A gift from a secret admirer, your honor.
Short-staffed tonight, Mr. Ross?
Or does the owner always hand-deliver bottles of vino?
Well, he does when it's the most expensive bottle
in my club's collection.
You must have made someone very happy.
The question is whom.
Well, I will have to check on that for you,
But, in the meantime, shall I uncork?
Oh, that won't be necessary.
I'll stick with my water.
Thank you.
Evening, judge.
Evening.
We got a call from a concerned citizen
that you were weaving as
you were pulling out from the beach club.
You had anything to drink tonight?
Not at all.
Yeah, well, just to be safe,
I'm still gonna need you to take a breathalyzer test.
Oh, I'd be happy to.
Even though it's unwarranted
and it could be considered an abuse of power,
officer, um... Hunter.
Just take a deep breath, hum as you blow into the machine.
Point 15.
Seems pretty warranted to me.
That's impossible.
Courthouse, huh?
You better get that.
Hello?
I may be blind,
but I can see you're in a bit of a pickle, judge.
Who is this?
You can call me Lady Justice.
And I'm trying to keep you honest,
which you haven't been, have you?
This is a setup, and it's poorly done.
I didn't even have that wine.
Oh, but the wine was just a gift.
Your water, on the other hand, was laced with acetone,
a compound commonly found in adhesives,
like model glue.
But don't beat yourself up.
I almost missed it myself.
The same chemical that caused
Jack Porter to fail his breathalyzer test.
This does not bode well for your re-election.
What do you want?
Test his blood.
and when you find no trace of alcohol
but the presence of acetone,
see that all charges are dropped.
And if I refuse?
All of the bribes you accepted
in the form of endorsements from Lemarchal publications
will be exposed.
And you'll lose everything, just like you threatened
to take from Jack.
The choice is yours.
Choose wisely.
I'll be watching you.
Why is it taking so long? It didn't work.
No, we don't know that.
And if it doesn't,
I will find another way to fix this.
This is my fault.
No, it's not.
We did what we had to do to protect ourselves.
Margaux's the one to blame.
It seems Judge Knowles had a change of heart.
All the charges have been dropped.
Oh, thank god! Buddy.
You saved my family, Emily.
I don't know how I'll ever repay you.
How about I start by taking you all out
for a celebratory lunch?
Sounds great.
Uh, thanks, but you guys go ahead.
I've got something I need to do.
Jack.
Hey. We need to talk.
Can it wait? I've got work to do.
No. It can't.
You just stopped the Porters
from suffering the same horrible fate that we did.
You should be celebrating with them
instead of doing what I think you're doing.
I told you. I can't let Margaux keep hurting my friends.
I have to...
Punish her for what she did.
And then what?
And then someone that loves her
comes after you or someone you love
and then on and on until there's just no one left.
I won't risk losing you like that, Amanda.
I didn't start all of this.
But you can finish it.
That's easier said than done.
It always is.
You are capable of so much.
You can end this, Amanda.
I believe in you.
Thank you kindly.
Goodbye.
Well, that's it.
Lyman's body's on its final trip home.
I'm gonna need something a touch stronger.
God. How are you holding up?
I'm sorry I haven't been around much since...
Oh, hush. Jack needed you.
And your hard work paid off... family's back together.
Well, I guess yours will be assembling soon, too.
D-do you want us to fly back to Savannah?
Look, I don't want to see the monster-in-law, either,
But it is your brother's funeral, and --
There's something I need you to know.
I wasn't honest with the cops.
I didn't think they would believe me
since it was so close to what happened to daddy.
I was afraid.
That night, when I got back from the party,
I found Lyman here snooping through your black laptop.
What?!
Okay, there's a lot of sensitive material in there.
What did he see?
Doesn't much matter now. Who's he gonna tell?
Louise...
Did you...
No. We were arguing by the bluff.
Things got heated.
I didn't push him, but I didn't help him.
I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you from the start.
You are the only person in my life
that doesn't keep secrets from me,
and I owe you the same.
I hope you don't hate me.
I could never hate you.
Do you think I should go to Ben and tell him the truth?
No.
Changing your story now will only arouse suspicion.
There's no evidence of foul play, so...
...you're safe.
It's Johnny from the club.
He said that the social worker from Jack's case is there.
You should go. Jack might need you.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Jack's charges were dropped.
I'm glad to hear that.
Really, Margaux?
After you stooped so low,
especially with your own child on the way?
I admit I was blinded by rage,
but since the only thing you respond to
is fear and intimidation, I sank to your level
because you're still preventing my child
from growing up in a world that knows who Daniel truly was.
Nobody deserves that life.
Which is why we have to put a stop to the cycle now.
Otherwise, it will continue until everyone we love is gone.
I propose a truce...
to protect the people we have left.
Do you think I'm a fool?
Just the opposite.
I believe you're a good person, Margaux,
who got caught up in all of this.
We can clear Daniel's name together.
You have my word.
Your word is worthless.
Not today.
This is my real birth certificate.
It's the one piece of evidence that can tie me to my identity.
You can use it as a weapon...
or you can accept it as a peace offering.
You hold all the cards now.
You can choose to end this.
The only way to end this is by you telling the world
the truth of what happened to Daniel.
Otherwise, this gesture means nothing.
It means that you can trust me when I say
that telling the truth is impossible
without putting more lives at risk.
Please, margaux. There are other ways.
No, Emily.
There's only one way, and it's not yours.
Doctor.
What do we have?
31-year-old female hit by a taxi.
No signs of head or neck injury.
Multiple contusions to the side, shoulder, and lower abdomen.
Okay, take her to trauma 2.
Can you tell me your name, miss?
Her name is margaux. She's nine weeks pregnant.
And who are you?
Her mother.
We'll take good care of her.
Excuse me.
Coming through.
It was an accident.
Around you, there are no accidents.
The car came out of nowhere.
I w-- I was trying to end this.
Get the hell out of my sight.
Mr. Hughes?
Were you looking for me?
Well, technically, Mr. Hughes isn't looking for you.
Tony is.
Well... Is Tony here now?
I'm Tony. What I meant to say is I'm not here on business.
Oh, I see.
I came here to apologize.
I've seen more than my share of selfish, dishonest people.
It's made me wary of everyone,
especially those who are extremely charming.
I...misjudged you.
What you said about your friend...
it really moved me.
So, uh...You didn't come here just to apologize,
Did you, Tony?
Not exactly.
I...came because...
I'm...an idiot.
No. No, no, no. Don't... don't be embarrassed.
I-I'm not. I just... I just saw your wedding ring.
In my line of work,
We don't take too kindly to, uh, homewreckers, and...
No, the ring is...
is not exactly what it looks like.
Ay. But it is a long story.
So...How about I buy you a drink?
He was out before "The little engine that could"
even left the station.
He had a big day, just like his daddy.
I'm sure you'll sleep just as well.
Thanks to you.
Oh, I was happy to help. And I didn't do it alone.
Your friends went above and beyond for you.
We've been through a lot together recently.
Sounds like it. I only got the abridged version.
This whole thing with Carl
is just the tip of the iceberg, you know?
Did I scare you off?
I don't scare easy, Jack.
I'm gonna put the kettle on.
Sounds like we have a lot to talk about.
May I come in?
You gave me quite a scare.
I thought I almost lost you.
Not me.
The baby.
He's gone.
Daniel's gone.
Oh, my darling.
I'm so sorry.
Dad!
Amanda?
I got your message. What's wrong?
I tried...
I tried to end it, like you said.
It's too late.
It's too late.
I...I...
It's okay.
I got you. I got you.
Have some water.
How are you feeling?
Margaux, I know this is difficult,
but talk to me.
Tell me what happened.
Why was Emily with you?
Please.
We only have each other now,
And I can't help you if you won't let me in.
Because whatever led to this loss... our loss...
Requires an explanation.
Tell me.
Whatever the truth, I will accept it.
Emily cornered me on the street.
She said she wanted peace.
She gave me her word.
But then...
