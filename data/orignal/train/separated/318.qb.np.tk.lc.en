care for a cupcake ?
well , our new outdoor seating area
is about as popular as paula deen at an nba game .
how much longer do we have to be out here ?
we are cold .
so , so cold .
i can see my breath .
and my boys are up by my rib cage .
i can smell his breath .
and my boys are up by where my boys used to be .
and these customers aren &apos;t helping .
how could we have thought a strong han presence
would make it more popular ?
max , in hindsight ,
it feels like us not springing for those heat lamps
was a bad call .
uh , you think ?
guys , i just peed a little to keep warm .
well , i peed a little
&apos;cause i had no choice .
great , they &apos;re stuck to the bench .
go get the windshield scraper .
reading us weekly , earl ?
ooh , &quot; stars . they &apos;re just like us . &quot;
well , if they &apos;re just like us ,
where &apos;s the picture of them turning their underwear inside out ?
caroline left it in the men &apos;s room .
and as i said that out loud ,
i realized that i must have been in the ladies &apos; room .
i can &apos;t see , max .
max , i &apos;ve got some exciting news !
eh , i vowed i &apos;d never get excited about anything again
万众期盼却只换来一部狗尾续貂之作
after that last indiana jones .
i found us two discount heat lamps on sherry &apos;s list .
it &apos;s like craigslist , but without the high probability
of being murdered by a deranged medical student .
谋杀上钩失足妇女 有改编电影 《 开膛手的名单 》
and about those lamps ?
uh , no .
we can &apos;t worry about our outdoor business .
we barely have an indoor business .
and we never will , with that attitude .
i &apos;m gonna ask you one more time :
please listen to those tony robbins tapes we found in the garbage .
是当今最成功的世界级潜能开发专家
well , girls , tomorrow &apos;s the day
i &apos;ve been looking forward to for three years .
you &apos;re getting your teeth cleaned ?
sorry , that &apos;s what &apos;s we &apos;ve been looking forward to .
i &apos;m moving in with sophie .
from now on , the booty call is coming from inside the house .
i couldn &apos;t help but overhear .
from way back there ?
your ears should give a pep talk to the other parts of your body .
and , oleg , if you need any help with the move ,
might i offer my services ?
my trainer skylar says i &apos;m getting ripped .
yeah , ripped off by skylar .
thanks , han .
and as a bit of a payback ,
i &apos;ll wash my hands back here tonight .
see you later , neighbors .
oleg &apos;s moving in ?
this is the worst thing that &apos;s ever happened to me .
and i lost $ 2 billion .
what is the problem ? this is all good news .
sophie an oleg are in love .
yeah !
and they &apos;ll be in love
on our stairs ,
in our hallway ,
and on every surface of the laundry room .
what do you know about love anyway , christian single ?
i know jesus has a girl for me .
he has to .
i &apos;m $ 400 deep into that damn website .
look , we just make a pact
that no matter what happens upstairs ,
or on the stairs or in the laundry room ,
we don &apos;t invite it into our apartment .
hey , everybody !
it &apos;s raining cats and goats out there .
don &apos;t you mean &quot; cats and dogs &quot; ?
oh , it &apos;s so nice to be corrected as you walk in the door .
hey , baby .
can you believe in 24 hours we &apos;ll be living in sin ?
oh , don &apos;t worry .
my parents don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m having a dinner party tomorrow night to celebrate .
and also because i have 15 pounds of beef
that &apos;s about to go bad .
so , max , caroline , are you in ?
actually , sophie , we &apos;re busy--
we &apos;ll be there .
if there &apos;s beef involved , i &apos;m involved .
what happened to the pact we just made ?
i hate to tell you this--
if it comes down to you or beef ,
i &apos;m always going beef .
that was sherry from sherry &apos;s list .
she makes you call her that .
she said she &apos;s consider charging us $ 150
if we pick up the heat lamps themselves .
and i &apos;m charging you with three counts of interrupting
this &quot; baby in a faulty high chair &quot; video .
someone fell in real life !
you told me you had it .
i said i didn &apos;t have it .
it &apos;s oleg and han moving in .
get away from the door !
han will see your feet under the door .
they &apos;re right at his eye level .
this is like a horror movie-- saw iii .
because when han bent over ,
i saw 3 inches of his crack .
3英寸是7.62公分
so you saw his whole crack ?
step away !
open the door , max .
i &apos;m about to kill han ,
and i know you &apos;re gonna want to see that .
damn it ! he &apos;s right .
cute outfit , han .
like one of those male strippers
from &quot; no thunder from down under . &quot;
this is so heavy .
oleg , what do you have in here ?
socks !
really , han ,
it &apos;s like your arms are only there for decoration .
to be fair , oleg &apos;s socks
probably have some pretty heavy loads in them .
oleg , what is all your junk doing out here ?
do i actually smell girls screaming ?
i bring things up , sophie says &quot; no , &quot;
i bring them right back down .
is there no elevator up in this bitch ?
oleg , you forgot your painting ,
and this one &apos;s a definite &quot; no . &quot;
sophie , i haven &apos;t gotten a &quot; yes &quot; yet ,
aside from the quickie we had up against the bathroom sink .
not such a quickie .
they locked me out and i had to eat my lunch in the truck .
then what was the point of me renting a moving truck ?
i mean , besides the rough sex we had up against the sides ?
they locked me outside on the side of the road for that one .
okay , well , we have to go back in .
see you tonight at the beef @-@ a @-@ thon .
no , oleg .
maybe i &apos;m being unfair .
i mean , you have all this stuff that you like ,
and they have an apartment .
put it in there .
sophie !
i &apos;ll see you at 8 : 00 !
so what do you say , girls ?
absolutely not--
yes .
max , there &apos;s a method to my madness .
oleg , will you excuse us a second ?
and maybe help han with that box .
in those shorts , i can actually see a hernia happening .
i thought we weren &apos;t getting involved !
if we help oleg out ,
he &apos;ll let us use the moving truck
to pick up our heat lamps .
i already said &quot; no &quot; to those .
but we just talked about it !
i wasn &apos;t listening !
that baby fell face @-@ down into mashed potatoes .
but you said &quot; yes &quot; to the dinner party ,
so if you get your meat , i get my heat .
just because you rhyme doesn &apos;t make it okay .
and i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s what rihanna said to chris brown .
where are we meeting this chick with the heat lamps ?
i haven &apos;t gone this far for something i didn &apos;t want
since planned parenthood moved to new jersey .
i &apos;m getting truck sick back here .
you &apos;re a worse driver than people assume i am .
come on ! come on !
we &apos;re gonna be late to dinner !
would any of you be interested in playing
rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors for a seat up front ?
no !
girls , can i ask you a relationship question ?
no !
and besides , what would we know about relationships ?
that &apos;s like asking donald trump
for the name of a good hairstylist .
到底是真发或假发一直众说纷纭
i mean , what &apos;s the deal with her ?
she asks me to move in ,
and then won &apos;t even let me have my painting ?
i mean , sophie already bought the cow .
she might as well let the cow &apos;s crap in .
so you &apos;re saying i &apos;m right .
no , no , but i do think--
no , you don &apos;t think ,
or your mouth wouldn &apos;t be moving right now .
i &apos;m just saying ,
he has the right to move some of his stuff
into sophie &apos;s apartment and out of ours .
speaking of his stuff ,
there &apos;s something in a box back here
is humming , and-- oh , it stopped .
oh , it started again .
that &apos;s my lifelike mouth with authentic jaw action .
oleg , watch the road !
the last words i hear can &apos;t be &quot; lifelike mouth . &quot;
everything looks very nice , sophie .
yeah , see ,
i &apos;m not gonna talk until the other guests arrive .
i got to save my hostess sparkle for the real guests .
hey , baby .
where the hell have you been ?
that was a pretty loud sparkle .
it &apos;s my fault we &apos;re late , sophie--
it &apos;s okay . just sit down .
don &apos;t you want to know what i was--
no , really . i got a pot roast over here
that &apos;s a hell of a lot more interesting .
max , thank god you &apos;re here .
there was so much awkward silence ,
i pretended i got a phone call from a banana .
i &apos;m gonna take a quick shower .
oh , oleg , dinner is ready .
you don &apos;t have time to run down to the &quot; y &quot; now .
no , i meant i would shower here .
here ...
in my bathroom ?
uh ... yeah .
i live here now .
oh , yeah .
that &apos;s right .
imagine that .
hey , oleg , why don &apos;t you just come over here
and sit next to earl ?
because he &apos;s old and i &apos;m sure his smeller is shot .
sophie , you really must write a &quot; how to entertain &quot; book .
here we go :
grandma chinkski &apos;s pot roast .
this looks amazing .
i love a root vegetable in the winter .
can it ever just be about me ?
* beef , beef , beef *
* b @-@ beef , b @-@ beef , beef *
what ? that &apos;s my beef song .
i &apos;d like to make a toast to sophie .
oh , that &apos;s sweet .
but not with that glass .
that &apos;s grandma chinski &apos;s crystal .
baby , i was in the middle of a toast .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , but ...
those are my favorite thing !
grandma chinski traded two of my slow cousins for those .
well , you know , it &apos;s funny .
i have a favorite thing too .
in fact , why don &apos;t i just go and get it ?
i can &apos;t believe it .
i &apos;m about to meet loni anderson !
can someone help me lift up my fork ?
my arms are still sore from the move .
open up .
someone else has to feed han .
he just licked my pinky .
earl , what are you doing over there ?
just hanging out with r &amp; b sensation ,
mary j.-juana.
oh , good .
so you &apos;re in the right mind @-@ set to hand @-@ feed a 30 @-@ year @-@ old man .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
i think that &apos;s polish for &quot; no . &quot;
yes , sophie .
it &apos;s my painting .
excuse me--our painting .
and it &apos;s going up on our wall .
is it me ,
or is this party tense as hell ?
i don &apos;t think sophie and oleg are gonna make it .
uh @-@ oh . am i talking out loud right now ?
i told you , i don &apos;t want that thing in here .
i don &apos;t understand . it &apos;s just a painting .
what &apos;s so bad about it ?
oh , my god .
nice , huh ?
i did it myself .
it &apos;s a paint @-@ by @-@ numbers .
只需选出颜料条中对应的数字颜料 用画笔填上即可
you mean it &apos;s a putin @-@ by @-@ numbers .
why are his nipples so big ?
they don &apos;t seem that big to me .
oh , i am too high for this .
i &apos;m not high enough .
in my culture , big nipples mean power and wealth .
in our culture , big nipples means ,
&quot; wears a t @-@ shirt in the pool . &quot;
there .
i like it .
adds a certain something to the room .
every wall needs nipples .
so a guy knows where to look .
thank you for telling me to do this , caroline .
she did ?
i &apos;d get up and run , but my legs are like taffy .
seriously ,
you told him to hang that thing up ?
in fairness , i had not seen the painting
when i suggested something like that .
i mean , i get it .
it &apos;s gorgeous .
but it doesn &apos;t go with the decor .
what ?
is it throwing off this gorgeous outdoor @-@ indoor swing ?
i &apos;ll cut you with the carving knife !
nobody is cutting anyone .
especially not me .
do you never learn ?
just put some beef in your napkin like i did ,
and let &apos;s get out of here .
sophie , you asked me to move in .
guess what ? i moved in .
yes , i asked you to move in ,
but not with big weird @-@ nipple putin .
well , how big are nipples supposed to be ?
&apos;cause--never mind .
and what &apos;s your problem anyway ?
i gave you a drawer .
this !
this is my drawer , everybody .
what good is this ?
i can &apos;t even get one of my ball gags in there .
you asked for a drawer , i gave you a drawer !
and who needs 12 ball gags anyway ?
oh , so now you don &apos;t like ball gags ?
who are you , lady ?
i &apos;ll tell you who i am--
i &apos;m the lady who &apos;s &quot; putin &quot; this is the trash !
you trash that , i &apos;ll trash this .
oh , no .
oh , you think you &apos;re gonna break
one of grandma chinski &apos;s glasses ?
no , if anyone &apos;s gonna break one , it &apos;s gonna be me !
this reminds me of the first half of my second marriage ,
and the second half of my third marriage .
sophie , i &apos;m done .
and as you said to me on our first date ,
&quot; i don &apos;t know how much more of this i can take . &quot;
fun party .
not awkward at all .
i should get going though .
got to be up early for-- what &apos;s a thing ?
church ?
* beef , beef , beef *
* b @-@ beef , beef , beef , beef *
sorry about that dinner party last night .
it kind of got away from me a little bit .
but i really appreciate you getting up early
and helping me move oleg &apos;s stuff back .
i just actually feel like this is a little bit my fault--
seriously !
can it ever just be about me ?
hey , um , where are we taking his stuff anyway ?
i don &apos;t think goodwill will take a love seat
that &apos;s actually covered in love .
well , i was thinking ,
you know , since oleg and i
really did have something special ,
i was thinking i would just take his stuff
and dump it down by the river .
okay , i &apos;m just gonna say it--
sophie , would it kill you
to just let oleg hang the damn painting ?
so what , you just park the truck
in the middle of the van wyck expressway ?
do you never learn ?
i almost ate rent @-@ a @-@ truck floor mat .
caroline , you get this straight--
oleg was wrong .
and those nipples were way too big .
this is awkward .
you &apos;re in the truck ?
no , you &apos;re in my apartment .
i think something hit us .
you guys just need some couples therapy .
i &apos;ll mediate it ,
since i &apos;ve had therapy myself .
not as a couple , but hopefully someday .
i &apos;m just sitting here waiting for the tow truck to come .
how &apos;s your neck , max ?
not so bad .
the second car that hit us kind of knocked
what the first car knocked out of place back in place .
i &apos;ll start .
this woman is a fraud and a liar .
okay , well , we need a little more oprah ,
a little less jerry springer .
嘉宾经常说着说着就干架
hey , don &apos;t dis springer .
they have great snacks in the green room .
you were on jerry springer ?
yeah , i was on &quot; i hate my roommate
and i don &apos;t know how to tell her . &quot;
oleg and i are not gonna talk this thing out .
if you want to waste your time ,
go teach in an inner city high school .
you know what ? even better--
i &apos;ll do the talking for oleg .
oh , then , max-- you be me , okay , max ?
oh--i don &apos;t know if--
do you want the rest of the beef , or not ?
this guy is a bum , and the painting has to go .
it &apos;s stupid .
really , really good , max ,
but next time just arch your back a little , and , yeah .
yeah .
okay , you be me .
no , i don &apos;t feel like getting a threatening erection right now .
but i will say , anytime people move in together ,
it &apos;s a compromise .
look at max--
when i needed a place to stay , she let me have my horse .
let me just say--and i brought this up on springer--
i only let you in because of the horse .
and i finally stopped putting up a fight
and let max walk around naked .
when did that happen ?
tomorrow .
oh , oleg ,
i wouldn &apos;t want you to give up walking around naked .
i mean , as long as you don &apos;t sit down on anything white .
makes sense .
nobody likes a chocolate starfish on an ottoman .
point , sophie .
i &apos;m winning , everybody !
well , it &apos;s therapy .
there are no winners and losers .
sounds like something a loser would say .
you know , oleg ,
this isn &apos;t about that silly little painting .
it &apos;s just , uh ,
a lot of change in a short amount of time ...
i &apos;m so scared .
sophie ,
i don &apos;t care about my stuff , as long as i have you .
what did we just do ?
we had them apart , and now we just put them back together .
you did that .
you don &apos;t know when to butt out .
jerry &apos;s words .
