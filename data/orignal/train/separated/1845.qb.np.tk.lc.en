they train doctors slowly .
they watch us practice on frogs ...
and pigs , and dead people ,
and then live people .
they drill us relentlessly .
they raise us like children .
and eventually , they take a cold , hard boot ,
and they kick us out of the nest .
i have great faith in you ... great faith .
i can because i chose you , i trained you .
i &apos;ve watched you work . i know what you can do .
that &apos;s why today is different .
the training wheels are coming off , people .
i &apos;m throwing down the gauntlet today , people .
i &apos;ve got a $ 1 million surplus
and one department gets it .
you know what you need ,
and i know what you need .
now i want to know what you want .
and i &apos;m gonna keep the residents busy , very busy .
so that &apos;ll give you time to put your best foot forward .
navy scrubs ?
attending scrubs .
you are attendings today .
run the cases , take point , but don &apos;t be a fool .
if you get in over your head , cry uncle .
until then ... congratulations.you &apos;ve just been promoted .
um , chief webber .
uh , sorry . i @-@ i didn &apos;t get any scrubs .
oh , this is for fourth @-@ year residents only , grey .
it &apos;s just a regular day for you .
well , fine .
well , if they &apos;re gonna be attendings ,
then that makes me chief resident .
no . that makes you our scut monkey .
no , it doesn &apos;t . does -- does it ?
it doesn &apos;t .
the attendings aren &apos;t going anywhere .
we &apos;re basically just playing dress up .
here you go .
thank you .
are you sure this is a good idea ?
of course it is . we all did it .
it &apos;s the evolution of the craft , the passing of the torch ,
the lifeblood of the training process .
here you go .
here you go .
pray , people .
we want god in the building today .
what time are we pitching you ?
yeah , is there an order ?
you people are adults . you decide the order .
i decide whose department gets the $ 1 million .
love a good dogfight .
he can be intimidating once you get in the room .
really ?
oh , yeah .
when i pitched my cartilage research last year ,
he was all ticked off
&apos;cause i had a typo in my table of contents .
y @-@ you had a table of contents ?
yeah .
what ? i love a good dogfight , too .
ruff .
it &apos;s my case .
are you gonna hand me over the chart ?
what factors would lead a patient
to want breast reduction surgery ?
uh , neck pain , back pain , balance issues .
hand it over .
keep trying .
i don &apos;t know . maybe she &apos;s a prude ,
uh , doesn &apos;t want everyone staring at her all the time .
maybe she &apos;s embarrassed .
no , but you &apos;re getting warmer .
hi , i &apos;m dr. karev .
mindy gruberman . nice to meet you .
i can work with that .
she &apos;s not the patient .
dr. robbins .
so you &apos;ll be on my service , too , huh ?
dr. karev &apos;s gonna be our team leader today .
excuse me .
honey .
quit futzing with the gown . come out here .
the doctors want to see you . come here .
what &apos;s up ?
ms. radigan , you &apos;re still having these headaches
and ringing in the ears ?
all day long . it &apos;s driving me crazy .
it &apos;s caused by a buildup of fluid in your skull .
so what we will do is insert a shunt ,
and that will relieve the pressure on your brain .
what do you mean , &quot; we &quot; ?
you &apos;re doing the actual tube part in the brain , right ?
n @-@ not them ?
excuse her . she &apos;s a schoolteacher .
she talks to everyone
like they &apos;re hiding gum behind their back .
that &apos;s all right . she can ask questions .
dr. grey and dr. avery are residents .
they &apos;re very talented .
one of them will be performing the procedure ,
and i will be observing .
a trainee cutting into ellie &apos;s brain ? no .
i know it sounds like a leap ,
but these doctors study and assist for years .
at some point , we have to let them operate .
that &apos;s how we make new surgeons .
let them learn on someone else .
who , someone who &apos;s too scared to interrogate the doctors ?
they have to learn on someone .
might as well be an old lady .
you &apos;re my old lady . this should be my call .
i won &apos;t let them move a muscle
without my direction and approval .
you &apos;re a teacher , joanne .
let the kids learn .
she &apos;s my life . she has been my life for 40 years .
do you hear me ?
i hear you .
who gets to cut ?
i want to get a look at both of you with a drill
before i decide who gets the shunt .
skills lab seems like a fair way to go .
competing with the wife ?
like that &apos;s not a stacked deck .
well , it &apos;s a game , really .
so all you have to do is win ,
which you won &apos;t .
i don &apos;t like the idea of teenagers getting plastic surgery .
if the growths were on his face ,
you wouldn &apos;t have a problem with him wanting them removed .
yeah , but i might have a problem
with karev removing them .
i &apos;ll give you that .
ooh . what happened ?
karev &apos;s about to do a gynecomastia surgery
on a 13 year old .
oh , karev &apos;s fine .
he &apos;s done way bigger procedures than that .
you two would just rather worry about him than about
your , uh , presentations to the chief .
oh , yeah . i &apos;m not worried .
the money is going to the tiny humans .
no one ever says no to the tiny humans .
okay .
what ?
well ... you &apos;re not gonna cry
&apos;cause you find the chief intimidating ?
no .
good . good .
all right . i have work to do .
okay . bye .
what , are you trying to psych her out ?
ortho needs the money . she and the friggin &apos; tiny humans
have all the help they need already .
i &apos;m getting the money . let it go .
oh , okay .
why wouldn &apos;t i ?
well , because you never prepare for anything .
you think you &apos;ll get by on your goodooks and charm
and the brilliance that pops off the top of your head .
yeah , &apos; cause it always works .
roy henley , 57 , was admitted 2 days ago
with severe wheezing from pulmonary hypertension ,
which basically means --
i can &apos;t breathe for crap .
we &apos;re gonna run some tests .
that should help us decide how to proceed .
you can run all the tests you want ,
but what i need &apos;s new lungs .
my doctor said i was gonna need &apos; em one day ,
but i was too healthy for it .
i bet i &apos;m not too healthy now .
dr. yang ?
we &apos;ll run some tests .
uh , mr. henley ,
you listed your daughter as your emergency contact .
is she here with you today ?
oh , no . she lives over in aberdeen .
i don &apos;t want to trouble her .
is there anyone here with you ?
i &apos;m a tough old dog . i don &apos;t need a chaperone .
sir , your -- your condition is serious .
it might be time to trouble your daughter .
do we think he &apos;s a transplant candidate ?
do we ?
well , at this point ,
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything else we can do , right ?
dr. yang , do you agree ?
i don &apos;t know .
you don &apos;t know if you agree ?
he &apos;d have to be approved by the transplant team
before going on the waiting list .
do we convene a panel ?
yang , do we ?
i couldn &apos;t say .
he &apos;s running out of time .
i say we convene the panel for today .
okay , convene the panel , and then what ?
i get some interns to order mr. henley &apos;s tests .
on it .
dr. yang .
&quot; i don &apos;t know &quot; ?
i &apos;m here . i am trying .
but taking point right now is --
i am not asking you to be in an o.r.
i am asking you to say something , to participate .
we &apos;re at a crossroads , yang ,
a crossroads where you either get in the game ...
or i tell richard it &apos;s time to send you home .
imagine -- seattle grace ,
the hospital that made heart surgery obsolete .
that &apos;s a ... big claim .
well , if the five million americans who suffer from heart failure
could simply just regenerate their own damaged hearts --
i mean , it sounds like magic , but it --
it &apos;s possible . it &apos;s happening .
dr. altman , stem cell research
is on the cutting edge of every field of medicine .
why cardio ?
well , cardio and -- and neuro
are the beacons of the hospital .
they &apos;re what put you on the map .
look , you know what ?
you -- you can &apos;t give this money to neuro .
i mean , neuro isn &apos;t even really a @-@ a department .
it &apos;s just one strong surgeon .
you &apos;re better off putting your money on to a deeper bench .
what do you mean ?
well , shepherd , he &apos;s like a charismatic cult leader .
he &apos;s very appealing
and he &apos;s got a bunch of people hiding in his shadows ,
but -- well , don &apos;t get me wrong , he is a great surgeon ,
and he can pull off a flashy procedure ,
but is he really cultivating talent ?
is he taking the time to teach your residents ,
knowing when to push
and dishing out tough love when--when they need it ?
i mean , that &apos;s the hard part . i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
maybe shepherd just doesn &apos;t like competition .
i mean , he tried to fire me .
well , i mean , not that i &apos;m holding a grudge or anything .
well , not-- not much of one anyway .
i &apos;m , uh , uh ...
well , i @-@ i feel like i should &apos;ve stuck to my notes .
is teddy saying you could be fired ?
sounded that way . well ,
is she trying to scare you ? is it working ?
i don &apos;t think so .
oh , damn it .
what &apos;s his problem ?
derek &apos;s got us competing for a brain shunt insertion .
the egg is the skull . you can break the shell ,
but you can &apos;t break the membrane .
damn it !
i feel bad for him . he &apos;s kind of losing it .
i shouldn &apos;t be in charge of anybody .
just put one foot in front of the other .
just get through the day .
grey !
you broke my concentration .
sorry .
um , hey , uh , post @-@ ops look good , so if there &apos;s nothing else ...
oh , could you discharge 12 @-@ 24 ?
and his chart needs to be dictated .
uh , yes , it &apos;s gonna have to wait
until after i check on torres &apos; knee girl ,
turf the window jumper to psych ,
remove a june bug from some kid &apos;s ear in the pit ,
write some meds for screaming @-@ kidney @-@ stones guy ,
and then deliver labs to my goiter lady .
stop bragging .
i can &apos;t . i was born for this kind of day .
no . stop .
seth , no . okay ?
this can wait a couple of years .
mom , you said this was my decision .
you said , after my bar mitzvah ,
i &apos;d be a man and i could decide .
that is because we thought by 13,
you &apos;d make the mature decision .
you can &apos;t just cut off
the parts of your body that you don &apos;t like , all right ?
i don &apos;t like my thighs , okay ?
or my saggy arms or my chin ,
but if we all cut off the parts we don &apos;t like ,
we &apos;d all have nothing left .
mom !
seth ! your father has the exact same chest as you ,
and nobody thinks he &apos;s a woman .
look , would you please talk to her ?
uh ... i &apos;m calling your father .
they call me booby at school .
man boobs , double &quot; d. &quot;
some kid keeps hanging a bra in my locker .
i &apos;m starting high school in a year .
it &apos;s gonna be all new people .
i just want to start over .
i want to be normal ...
like everyone else .
why can &apos;t we just skip the panel ?
we know i need the lungs .
not everyone makes a good transplant candidate .
if someone can &apos;t reliably
take their anti @-@ rejection meds ...
i can .
or have severe disease in another organ .
i don &apos;t .
oh , well , there are are just a lot of indicators
as to whether a person is strong enough to survive the surgery .
i want to know what she thinks ,
the one with the sourpuss on her face .
i don &apos;t have a sourpuss . this is just my face .
it &apos;s true . it is just her face .
you think i &apos;ll ... pass the panel ?
i couldn &apos;t say .
oh , cheer up , sourpuss .
you &apos;re young ,
you got your health .
i think you &apos;re doing all right , both of you .
practically kids and doctors , no less .
i bet your dads are really proud .
i &apos;m from a small town , a farm , actually .
so yes , my dad was over the moon
when i became a doctor .
what about you ?
karev . seth &apos;s mother just came by
saying she wants to pull the plug on the kid &apos;s procedure .
that your idea of taking point ?
well , i &apos;m--i &apos;m gonna talk to her .
i spent two hours consulting with this family last month .
ten minutes with you , they &apos;re ready to walk .
pediatric surgery is 80 % parent management .
karev you know that .
i &apos;m handling it .
megan , hi . uh , i am dr. grey .
just checking in to see how you &apos;re feeling .
megan . meg .
she doesn &apos;t hear well when she &apos;s texting .
i can hear her . thanks .
where &apos;s the other doctor-- dr. torres ?
oh , i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll be checking you today .
how &apos;s your knee ? is the , uh , pain any better ?
look , you seem really sweet ,
but this whole , like , super @-@ busy , messy @-@ hair ,
running @-@ around @-@ like- a @-@ banshee thing you have going
doesn &apos;t exactly inspire confidence .
i mean , you don &apos;t even know my case .
meg whealon , age 28,
tibial plateau fracture caused by a bicycle accident .
at least that &apos;s what you told the e.r. ,
but you told dr. torres that
you were going 30 miles an hour ,
which makes me think that you were on your boyfriend &apos;s motorcycle ,
and i &apos;m gonna guess that he has a license for it , and you don &apos;t .
this is off the top of your head ?
i memorized your chart .
your facture was fixed with elevation and percutaneous screw fixture .
you are allergic to penicillin , currently on blood thinners
to make sure you don &apos;t develop d.v.t. ,
and if you would just talk to me about your knee ,
then i could adjust your pain meds and be out of your hair .
she &apos;s good .
you &apos;re good .
i &apos;m busy , but i can handle it .
every doctor in this hospital needs trauma training--
disaster training .
you &apos;ve got a strong department .
no , no , not just my staff . everyone .
11 people died in that shooting .
now eight of them ... never had a chance ,
but the other three could &apos;ve been saved .
charles percy had a gunshot wound to the abdomen .
miranda bailey did everything that she was trained to do .
she gave him fluids , controlled the bleeding , applied pressure .
then she tried to get him to an o.r. ,
but she couldn &apos;t , and so he died .
now a doctor with disaster training
would &apos;ve been able to assess that environment more quickly
and would &apos;ve known an alternative escape route .
dr. bailey was not trained to do that ,
and neither are 90 % of the doctors on your staff .
she &apos;ll remember him dying in her arms
for the rest of her life .
and i &apos;ll remember .
and you &apos;ll remember that we could &apos;ve saved him .
we failed her .
we failed charles percy , one of our own doctors .
i can &apos;t face that .
i can &apos;t face that ever again .
can you ?
i &apos;d like to expand the burn unit at seattle grace ,
make us the go @-@ to destination for serious burn victims .
i &apos;d also like to upgrade us
to a real nationally renowned center for cosmetic reconstructive surgery .
two subspecialties ?
well , revenue from the cosmetic center
will help support the burn unit .
one hand scratches the other .
it &apos;s a nice idea ,
and an awfully ambitious plan for $ 1 million ,
and a tremendous amount of work .
i &apos;m not seeing anyone right now .
i &apos;m not sleeping with nurses ...
residents , attendings , nobody .
so i &apos;m an untapped source of raw power .
i &apos;m telling you , i have the energy of ten men .
so with your $ 1 million and my untapped stores ,
we can move mountains .
are you excited ? i &apos;m excited .
leave .
right now . just ...
just ...
mrs. gruberman , every surgery has its risk ,
but this one is pretty simple . look , it &apos;ll make your son
feel a whole lot better about himself .
well , if the surgery is really a good idea ,
i would like to hear it from dr. robbins and dr. sloan .
look , i &apos;m--
no . i will speak to dr. robbins and dr. sloan .
cristina . cristina . roy &apos;s labs .
he &apos;s got fungal pneumonia ,
and his creatinine clearance is dangerously low .
i mean , if it gets any worse , we &apos;re looking at renal failure .
i &apos;m surprised he was sitting up and talking .
i mean , a @-@ after surgery ,
couldn &apos;t the immunosuppressants kill him ?
maybe .
well , okay , i @-@ i @-@ if we don &apos;t recommend him , he dies .
but , uh , if we recommend someone who won &apos;t survive ,
then it &apos;s just a waste of an organ
that could &apos;ve gone to someone else . what do you think ?
i don &apos;t know .
you need to know .
we have to have an opinion .
we called the stupid panel .
we have to stand up in front of teddy ...
and the chief and a roomful of doctors
and recommend whether this guy lives or dies .
it &apos;s right down the middle with this guy , like a trick question .
he &apos;s a trick patient .
fine . forget it .
the right opinion , the only opinion that matters is teddy &apos;s ,
so i will just figure out what she thinks ,
and i will say that .
okay .
d @-@ don &apos;t you care at all ?
come on . you gotta care .
no , you did not say that to the chief .
it &apos;s your fault , you know ? you psyched me out .
what ? all i ever do is support you .
oh , look at that face . that &apos;s her game face .
she &apos;s--she &apos;s in it to win it .
no .
oh , hey , karev , did you talk to seth &apos;s mother ?
no , she &apos;s thinking about it . she may want to talk
to you guys again .
way to handle it .
what ? i can &apos;t force her to listen to me .
keep your face in that book .
it &apos;ll inspire confidence .
oh , my god .
okay , that &apos;s getting in someone &apos;s head .
i &apos;m just honest .
oh , i &apos;m up with the chief . i gotta go .
oh , knock him dead . oh , wait .
i brought you tissues , just in case .
thanks .
you have a sickness .
hmm ?
you do .
what ?
okay , 30 seconds .
if neither one of you breaks the membrane ,
i &apos;m gonna have to judge you on precision ,
so make sure your initials are clean and clear .
dr. shepherd
yes ?
stop talking !
five , four ...
three , two , one .
time .
what do you got ?
not bad .
what about you , dr. avery ?
i just wish i had more time .
really ?
you did your whole name ?
what ? !
you conned me .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
he hustled me . he went through two dozen eggs
and made me think i didn &apos;t have to practice .
well , if you didn &apos;t practice , meredith ,
you were overconfident .
dr. avery , congratulations .
you have the surgery .
and then i would take the remaining money
and invest it in resources
for less invasive pediatric cancer surgeries .
even the smallest change
could dramatically improve the lives of so many children .
wouldn &apos;t that be amazing ?
well , that is a very compelling
and very focused presentation , dr. robbins .
you seem surprised .
no . no , not at all .
did you think i was gonna cry ?
yeah .
torres suggested that i was going to cry as well .
i think that we should all try
to wipe the whole crying thing out of our memories .
it happens very rarely , it &apos;s ... embarrassing ,
and--and frankly , i think that i &apos;ve got it under control .
and the fact that my colleagues see me as the type of person
who would burst into tears
in the middle of an important , professional situation ,
well , that doesn &apos;t make me weepy . that makes me mad .
like , violent . it makes me want to punch someone .
and , you know , i @-@ i &apos;m the daughter of a marine , sir ,
so i was taught to hit as a child .
i was taught to hit fast and hit hard
so you only have to hit once , and now i feel like hitting
a person or a wall-- no , a person .
let &apos;s just circle back to the sweet little children .
here you go . thank you .
i like the dark blue scrubs on you . you look good .
you okay ?
my patient deserves a doctor .
you don &apos;t have to cut . nobody &apos;s asking you to .
i know that . i know--i know what &apos;s being asked of me ,
and i &apos;m doing it .
okay , i got an idea .
and i @-@ i think it &apos;s gonna help .
you and me , we &apos;re gonna go outside ...
into the alley behind the hospital ,
and you &apos;re just--you &apos;re just gonna kick my ass .
you &apos;re gonna knock the living crap out of me .
there you are .
i knew you were in there somewhere .
at the end of this day , good or bad ,
we &apos;re gonna go home together .
whatever it takes to get him home .
i just want to get him home .
yeah .
13 is young for plastic surgery ,
but your kid &apos;s not gonna grow out of it .
he &apos;s already gone through puberty ,
and his father &apos;s had the same condition his entire life
look , if he had weight to lose ,
i would advise diet and exercise ,
but your kid doesn &apos;t have a weight problem .
he has breasts .
he needs excision of the glandular tissue .
and yeah , it could wait till he &apos;s older ,
but he &apos;s a dude with breasts ,
and he &apos;s headed for high school ,
and there &apos;s no reason he should be subjected to the psychological damage
that comes from years of taking schoolyard crap .
look , you want your kid to be a man ?
let him make his own decisions .
any other questions ?
hey . i got a page . is everything okay ?
something &apos;s wrong .
first she had a headache , and then--
i can &apos;t see . everything is blurry .
okay , look right here .
i am freaking out . tell me i don &apos;t need to freak out .
the whole left side of my body feels weird .
i thought it was because i fell asleep on it ,
but it &apos;s tingling .
okay , squeeze my hand .
she had knee surgery . what the hell is going on ?
i don &apos;t know yet , but i &apos;m gonna order a head c.t. ,
and then i am going to page for a neuro consult .
looks like you &apos;re gonna get
to see another doctor today after all .
the minute i hand you this drill , you &apos;re on your own .
you may have hustled dr. grey ,
but you better not have hustled me .
this is not a game .
this is a real brain .
i got it . i &apos;m ready .
dr. shepherd ,
lexie grey &apos;s paging for a consult , repeatedly .
i &apos;m in surgery .
dr. grey .
well , are you sure ? i wouldn &apos;t want to be overconfident .
cardio is not my thing .
what ?
neuro is my focus ,
and this is cardiothoracic ,
and i &apos;ve had relatively little experience with cardiothoracic .
and yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m gonna walk in there today
and humiliate myself ,
or humiliate you , or teddy , or the chief .
you know , really ,
anyone who could possibly be humiliated by my failure
is gonna be humiliated today .
he was admitted two days ago .
teddy could &apos;ve convened a panel yesterday ,
but she didn &apos;t .
she doesn &apos;t think he &apos;s a candidate .
no , she doesn &apos;t , so just say that , and you &apos;ll be fine .
everyone will be fine except for roy ,
who will be dead .
way to kill a happy moment .
where &apos;s shepherd ? i paged shepherd .
you got me .
are you her boss ? &apos; cause there &apos;s something seriously wrong here .
i am . sir , i need you to go to the waiting room right now .
but i--
right now .
sir , come with me .
okay , um , she &apos;s-- she &apos;s post @-@ op day two
from a tibial plateau fracture .
she--she was fine all day , fine , and then ten minutes ago ,
she started complaining of headae , blurred vision
and tingling on the left side of her body .
i @-@ i ordered a stat head c.t.
i cannot believe that you &apos;re
the neuro consult .
is she on blood thinners ?
yes , for d.v.t. prophylaxis .
she &apos;s got a brain bleed . let &apos;s book an o.r.
h @-@ how didn &apos;t i see this coming ?
did you check her platelets ?
yes .
and everything was normal ?
until now , yes .
okay , well ,
you checked her platelets , you got a c.t. ,
you called neuro . you did everything right .
the only thing you &apos;re doing wrong
is standing around talking about it , wasting time ,
while we should be getting her to the o.r.
you totally sounded like an attending .
right ? let &apos;s page shepherd 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
okay .
dr. shepherd , it &apos;s dr. grey again .
meredith grey .
just passing the ventriculostomy tube now .
almost there .
all right .
take your time , dr. avery . you want to make sure that--
damn it . damn it . damn it . damn it .
are you kidding me ? are you kidding me ?
what did you do ?
and that is why the future of ortho is in xenografting .
you think i &apos;m nuts .
you &apos;re thinking ,
i don &apos;t want some cow ligament in my leg .
that sounds wacky .
is that supposed to be my voice ?
no . that &apos;s the ...
the voice of the average baby boomer .
i was hoping for something more ...
inspirational .
for--for example ,
dr. robbins suggested that we take a little--
oh , yeah . yeah . tiny humans .
what ?
arizona &apos;s nicer than i am .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
she &apos;s more patient .
she went to hopkins .
she &apos;s more renowned in her field .
she &apos;s a much better lesbian .
i mean , i was sort of a late bloomer in that area ,
but she &apos;s got this whole circle of lesbian friends , you know ?
it &apos;s just like-- like this subculture .
and , uh , i &apos;m always just ...
i &apos;m always just a little bit left out ,
just a little bit talked down to
because i have a long history of enjoying sex with men ,
which i don &apos;t think is something i have to apologize for .
whatever . i &apos;m just-- she &apos;s just--she &apos;s ...
she &apos;s just better .
so you want me to give ortho $ 1 million
to level the playing field in your relationship ?
also for the xenografting ,
which , as i mentioned , is ...
the future of sports medicine .
can i ask you something ?
are you one of those , uh ,
you know , what do you call &apos; em ?
when someone &apos;s really smart , like a genius ,
but they &apos;re a little different ,
like they don &apos;t know how to talk to people ?
are you asking me if i &apos;m autistic ?
that &apos;s the word .
oh , come on .
you barely said three words all day .
don &apos;t be offended . you &apos;re a tough nut to crack .
i like that about you . my daughter &apos;s the same way .
were you able to make contact with her ?
oh , yeah . she &apos;s not coming .
i &apos;m not all that surprised .
you know , messy divorce . she sided with her mom .
i mean , i hate it , but i get it .
life goes on .
so it &apos;s just you and me , sourpuss .
dr. yang , the , uh , panel is gathering now .
yeah , i &apos;ll be right there .
this is gonna go my way , right ?
i mean , they just don &apos;t send people home to die ?
i want to live .
we &apos;ll let you know .
is there anything i can do or--
i don &apos;t know , avery .
is there anything you can do ? thank you .
where are you ?
uh , we &apos;re having a problem .
i &apos;m fixing it now .
okay , i &apos;ve got a post @-@ op ortho patient
on d.v.t. prophylaxis with a subdural hematoma .
derek , she &apos;s got a blown pupil .
i &apos;m not gonna be there for a while ,
so you gotta take care of it yourself .
what ?
you wanted a solo surgery today .
now &apos;s your chance . take point .
i need loops and a headlight .
here you go , doctor .
okay , scalpel .
if i root against him , does that make me a bad guy ?
the patient &apos;s a child , mark .
all right , karev , you got this .
if you don &apos;t , we &apos;re right here .
all right , people , here we go . 10 @-@ blade .
okay .
you &apos;re letting kepner lead the transplant panel ?
well , yang &apos;s been useless . she &apos;s no better than an intern .
did you just stop that bleeder ?
uh @-@ huh .
how did you even know to do that ?
okay . sorry i &apos;m late .
that &apos;s okay . lexie made a good call .
i &apos;ve got it under control .
what do we got ?
let me finish , derek . i got this .
yes , you do .
i &apos;m gonna find a cure for alzheimer &apos;s .
the cure for alzheimer &apos;s ...
with $ 1 million ?
with $ 1 million . it &apos;s a start .
you &apos;re talking about a clinical trial ,
a clinical @-@ surgical trial ?
yes .
start @-@ up costs alone , never mind the f.d.a. ,
derek , it &apos;s--
today i watched meredith perform
an emergency craniotomy by herself .
she was perfect .
she &apos;s got her mother &apos;s talent .
she &apos;s got her mother &apos;s looks , richard .
what if she has her mother &apos;s disease ?
ellis was young when it started .
every time meredith forgets her keys
or asks what day of the week it is , i ...
when that $ 1 million runs out ,
investors are gonna throw money my way
for the same reason i am gonna throw
everything i got at this trial ,
because their dad has it , or their wife .
breakthroughs don &apos;t happen because of the medicine .
real breakthroughs happen
because someone is scared to death to stop trying .
they &apos;re gone ?
well , there &apos;s some swelling ,
but that should go down with some time .
i don &apos;t have boobs .
i @-@ i don &apos;t have boobs ?
you don &apos;t have boobs .
mom .
she was scared . now she &apos;s just happy you &apos;re okay .
you &apos;re the man .
no , you &apos;re the man .
roy henley has end @-@ stage pulmonary hypertension .
he has reached the point of no return ,
and at this point , nothing short of a lung transplant
will save him .
unfortunately ...
unfortunately , his cultures
revealed that he has fungal pneumonia ,
his liver enzymes are worrisome ,
and on top of everything else ,
his creatinine clearance is only 75,
which means that he is on his way to kidney failure .
the immunosuppressants after surgery
could very likely kill him ,
and so ...
with regret , i conclude that he does not belong
on the waiting list .
dr. kepner , if you don &apos;t believe he &apos;s a candidate ,
why in the world would you convene a panel today ?
that is ... a very good question , chief .
i did think that he was a candidate
earlier in the day ,
but the longer i looked at his criteria ,
the more glaring it became .
it became glaring the more you looked at it ?
well ...
also , um , n @-@ new facts came to light .
um ...
the patient has no support system .
uh , no one to take him for post @-@ op visits ,
or make sure that he complies with his meds .
ear @-@ earlier in the day , he said he had a daughter ,
but later it came out that they &apos;re estranged .
that &apos;s not a reason .
dr. yang ...
do you have something to add ?
no .
you don &apos;t believe that having a support system in place
is an important factor in this decision ?
it &apos;s one factor .
if this guy is borderline ,
i mean , that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
we could talk about his criteria all day .
i mean , his creatinine clearance is low but not critical ,
and his--his--
his fungal pneumonia is bad but treatable .
i mean , he &apos;s borderline .
but i &apos;ve been involved in 27 transplant surgeries ,
and every time ,
the patient &apos;s will to fight is just as telling ,
and roy has it .
if we give him the lungs , it won &apos;t be a waste ,
&apos;cause he will live .
i know it .
so how am i ... what am i supposed to say to her ?
that i botched the insertion and--and then , uh ,
i punctured the vessel , or maybe that an error was made ,
or--
you don &apos;t tell her anything .
you made a mistake . it happens all the time .
i had to yell at you because that &apos;s my job .
my job now is to--our job now is to go in there
with smiles on our faces and tell her
the surgery was a success , because it was .
hey , how are we ?
there they are , hey . how are our heroes .
the ringing stopped .
it stopped .
that &apos;s fantastic news .
and the kid did good , right ?
the kid did good .
i &apos;m kissing you now , &apos; cause i was wrong .
but in this moment , i am in love with you .
oh , thank you .
we were supposed to be a team today .
you told me what to say , and then you just turned on me ?
i didn &apos;t plan it .
i &apos;m not used to failing .
neither am i.
okay ? all right .
i know you think recommending him
was the wrong decision .
i &apos;m sorry , but i just ... didn &apos;t agree .
cristina , in a case like this ,
the right decision ... is making a decision .
that &apos;s what we do . that &apos;s the job .
you formed an opinion and you argued for it .
and you weren &apos;t alone .
the panel voted to put him on the list .
congratulations .
you were a doctor today .
all right . talk to me .
um , there is a broken c.t. machine in the basement ,
next to it is a broken argon laser
and a broken fluoroscope .
i think $ 1 million would repair all 3 of them .
and there might even be enough money left over
to put a new nurse on the night shift ,
which is what our patients really need .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s what you got for me ?
that &apos;s your best idea ?
this assignment couldn &apos;t have been clearer--
inspiration , good , old @-@ fashioned competition .
not you coming in here
telling me i need to fix what &apos;s old and broken .
um , i would love to go to paris ,
but you don &apos;t see me sitting around
planning my parisian vacation .
it sounds nice , but i am a mother ,
and what i really need to do
is get my kid to preschool , get the laundry done ,
put food on the table .
all right , i can do a big tap dance here
about how i &apos;m gonna change the face of medicine
with $ 1 million ,
but come on , you can &apos;t do anything with $ 1 million .
$ 1 million is nothing .
that &apos;s a dream .
this is real life . preschool , laundry , food-- .
i &apos;m realistic .
change the face of medicine ...
we need to fix the medicine that we already have .
we need a new night nurse .
we need these broken machines repaired .
let &apos;s not go to paris . let &apos;s go to the grocery store , chief .
and while we &apos;re being honest ,
why are you wasting our time with this exercise anyway
when you and i both know you don &apos;t have $ 1 million ?
well , things may be a little different around here
in the next few weeks .
look at that .
now i can &apos;t call you sourpuss anymore .
give me your arm , roy .
i have to draw some blood .
we all want to grow up .
we &apos;re desperate to get there ,
to grab all the opportunities we can ...
to live .
we &apos;re so busy trying to get out of that nest ...
we don &apos;t think about the fact
that it &apos;s going to be cold out there ...
really freakin &apos; cold .
thank you , sir .
congratulations . good job .
because growing up
sometimes means leaving people behind .
congratulaons , doctor .
thanks .
oh , damn it . where are my keys ?
they &apos;re in your hand .
and by the time we stand on our own two feet ...
