no .
let me try that again .
no .
you &apos;re so cute when you &apos;re being emphatic .
your brow gets all ...
and the key word here is &quot; emphatic &quot; &quot;
mom said yes .
because mom likes to make me the mean divorced dad .
i say no .
why ? why do i say no ?
because i do not want some palestinian version
of yourself blowing you up .
dad , it &apos;s a kibbutz .
unless one of the tractors blows up ,
i &apos;m going to be fine .
and do you know how hypocritical this is ?
you &apos;re the one who always pushed me towards religion .
of course i know how hypocritical this is .
i &apos;m a parent .
it &apos;s my prerogative .
and now i have to go and save a campaign .
are we having dinner on thursday night ?
unless you back out .
you look happy .
are you seeing someone ?
yes .
my pollster .
i &apos;m the pollster .
i &apos;m the daughter .
good @-@ bye .
uh , she &apos;s 18 .
no . i didn &apos;t say anything .
is it good ?
it &apos;s a silver bullet .
wendy scott @-@ carr , the untouchable candidate ,
just became touchable .
what &apos;s her name ?
natalie flores .
a student at depaul , in economics .
how long was she with wendy ?
five years .
judge adler was doing her usual vetting
and wendy scott @-@ carr tried to hide everything about her .
flores &apos;s address .
well , i &apos;ll just go and complete the vetting .
you , uh , might get to the candidate &apos;s wife first .
this hits , the press will go right to her for comment .
alicia won &apos;t help .
as long as she doesn &apos;t hurt .
no , i don &apos;t want a debate on it . just fix it .
and don &apos;t look to derrick .
bp is all our concern now .
get me citings by 5 : 00 .
alicia , you sit with them .
you &apos;re doing a great job on cowley .
okay ?
i just got off with her . you got any more ...
we &apos;ve got a problem .
she &apos;s on to us .
i &apos;ll call back .
she &apos;s on to us ? who &apos;s on to us ?
the way she &apos;s dealing with the equity partners ,
the way she &apos;s isolating my people .
she &apos;s gearing up for a fight .
get the judge back on the phone .
you think i &apos;m wrong ?
i think i am surrounded by paranoid people .
i calmed the waters .
i stopped her defection .
diane &apos;s behaving as any other name partner would ,
as you should .
i think i made a mistake firing one of my people .
i lost one of my votes .
i &apos;m going to hire him back .
you got to do what you got to do .
look , i don &apos;t give a damn who &apos;s wrong .
kalinda , you sit with them .
where &apos;s blake ?
uh , i heard he &apos;s out sick .
okay . you sit with them .
help them prepare questioning ,
because honestly , what i give a damn about is ...
is ...
what i give a damn about ...
it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s not ... it &apos;s not just , uh ...
it &apos;s just ...
one minute .
hello .
hi .
been a while .
yes . quite a while .
where have you been ?
here , there .
you ?
here .
i need your help .
ms. clinton seems to be doing quite well for herself .
yes . so &apos;s your girl palin .
2012 , huh ?
that &apos;s the hope .
dear god .
couldn &apos;t be worse than your man barack .
really ?
i &apos;m always astounded
when a man like you expresses such unadulterated drivel .
funny . i &apos;m never astounded when you do .
i &apos;m being sued for $ 36 million .
see if will will take my 11 : 00 .
thank you .
i &apos;m just listening . that &apos;s all .
who &apos;s suing you ?
jason beltran .
you know who that is ?
i do .
he just had his life sentence overturned .
he did .
a mistake was made at the cook country crime lab ,
and that &apos;s why he was freed .
i think he was freed
because he was innocent , and the cops set him up .
he was freed because a crime lab tech made a mistake .
manufactured evidence .
and misrepresented facts .
who lied under oath .
anyway , i didn &apos;t lie under oath ,
and i didn &apos;t manufacture evidence .
but my trial testimony supported the lab tech &apos;s findings .
now , mr. beltran shot and killed a police officer
during the commission of a bank robbery
and my ballistics testimony helped convict him .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s coming after me .
beltran says he was an innocent bystander at the bank ,
and the cops came after him because he was black .
he &apos;s lying .
i have to think about it .
no . kurt ...
our firm benefited from this cook county crime lab malfeasance .
we had two criminal cases overturned ,
so i need to think about it .
it &apos;s not a brush @-@ off .
you should have called me .
when you got back from your case in florida .
you &apos;re right . i should have .
i &apos;m sorry .
bond thinks you &apos;re on to him ,
so can you stop showing so much intensity
in the staff meetings , please ?
diane ?
what ?
you look happy .
i am happy . i &apos;ve decided i &apos;m good at my job .
you are good at your job .
i &apos;ve always said it .
what is it ?
we have a silver bullet .
something that will destroy wendy scott @-@ carr ,
but when we fire it , the press will come for you .
and i will send them to you .
no , it &apos;s not what you &apos;re thinking .
later today , i &apos;m meeting with a woman named natalie flores
who worked for five years as wendy scott @-@ carr &apos;s nanny .
that &apos;s your silver bullet ?
yes .
she had a nanny ?
it &apos;s never the big things that bring politicians down .
she is an illegal alien .
wendy wants to be state &apos;s attorney ,
and for five years , she broke the law .
and not just any law .
people do not like illegal aliens .
and why would the press come to me ?
you were a stay @-@ at @-@ home mom .
isn &apos;t it great ?
you were june cleaver .
for 15 years , you raised the kids ,
no nannies , no illegal aliens .
you &apos;re as american as apple pie .
i &apos;m so glad those 15 years weren &apos;t wasted .
yeah , don &apos;t say anything like that to the press , okay ?
you &apos;re the good mom .
my staff will send over some brownie recipes .
hey , mom . pick up the phone .
hey , mom . pick up the phone .
well , i have to go and do some good mothering now .
grace .
you need a what ?
a t @-@ shirt .
it &apos;s not my fault , mom . the school &apos;s fascist .
they won &apos;t let me go back to class unless i change my t @-@ shirt .
hello ?
tommy .
what a surprise .
would you like to sit down ?
no , no .
i &apos;d like you to know that kurt mcveigh is the enemy .
so imagine my surprise when i discovered
who &apos;s representing him .
your information is premature .
i haven &apos;t decided yet .
good , good . then let me help you out .
the cops set up jason beltran .
they got the crime lab to fake the evidence ,
and they got your ballistics expert to change his testimony .
why are you suing , tommy ?
he &apos;s free .
your client &apos;s free .
to teach the authorities a lesson .
i get a big award from mcveigh ,
that will scare the state attorney into settling .
we &apos;ve worked on a lot of cases together , diane .
the grocer &apos;s union , the houston squatters .
this goes against everything you stand for .
you don &apos;t know everything i stand for .
they want to use you , diane ,
a known and respected liberal .
they want to put a pretty face on a racist defense .
don &apos;t you see that ?
you know what ?
thanks for helping me decide .
i &apos;ll see you in court .
you &apos;re going to lose a lot of friends over this one .
then they weren &apos;t friends to begin with .
i &apos;ll go after you hard .
looking forward to it . do your worst .
good @-@ bye .
馒头 goldencui 小泡 petty
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s what ?
the saying . it &apos;s not allowed .
it &apos;s a christian saying , right ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
we &apos;ve restricted all sayings on shirts .
uh , and you don &apos;t think you &apos;ll have a problem
with the first amendment ?
a month ago , some kids wore
pro @-@ gay t @-@ shirts to school .
then other kids wore anti @-@ gay shirts .
this is not about the first amendment .
i understand you have some issues here , ma &apos;am .
but you don &apos;t circumvent those issues
by infringing on my daughter &apos;s rights .
you open yourself up to a lawsuit .
my firm is fighting a case like this , and ...
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry . i just can &apos;t .
i just ...
you have no idea how hard it is .
everyone &apos;s threatening me .
everyone &apos;s threatening to sue .
you should sue .
it &apos;s the first amendment .
so , are we christians now ?
no . they weren &apos;t letting shannon wear it ,
so i decided to wear it , too .
can you just go to school and get an education , please ?
yes , i am on my way in . everything all right ?
but what if this were a different time
and they weren &apos;t letting kids wear martin luther king shirts ?
i &apos;ll be right there .
what martin luther king shirts ?
grace , honey , i know you want a cause ,
but this isn &apos;t your cause .
why not ?
because christians are in no danger
of becoming a minority class .
we &apos;ll talk . i got to go to work .
go to school .
i need you to help diane with this law suit .
he just got dropped by his insurance ,
and he &apos;s pushing for a quick trial .
my only worry is that
diane will lose her perspective on this one .
and you want me to ...
keep that perspective .
okay .
how you doing ?
i ...
never better .
good .
clearly , the most complicated crime scene of the year .
500 rounds fired .
over 55 weapons . a shootout that lasted three minutes .
one police officer killed ...
four bank robbers .
five .
four bank robbers were killed at the crime scene ,
and a suspected fifth , jason beltran , was arrested .
i feel like i &apos;m being handled here .
we intend to pursue the same strategy
as your insurance company .
which was ?
you made a mistake .
what mistake ?
strategically ,
the only way we win the suit
is to admit to an honest mistake .
they need to prove collusion
between you and the crime lab .
they need to prove that you wanted to get beltran
and ... they can &apos;t .
what they can do is play off your ego .
it &apos;s well known you only take cases you believe are ...
true .
they &apos;ll try to show that you skewed the evidence
to make the case true .
ms. sharma , call for you .
who is it ?
he won &apos;t say .
he said you &apos;d know what it &apos;s regarding .
um , just take a number , and i &apos;ll call back .
i understand that you have to fight the best case ,
not the truest case , but why ...
isn &apos;t my strongest defense that there was no mistake ?
because the court
has determined that beltran was wrongly convicted ,
and we can &apos;t refight that .
that &apos;s why i need you to swallow your pride ,
so we can win .
i determined
the direction and the caliber of the bullet
that killed officer walter , that &apos;s all .
i can &apos;t lie on the stand
about a mistake that doesn &apos;t exist .
it &apos;s just ...
thank you .
find his mistake .
and if there isn &apos;t one ?
he supported the lab tech ...
there has to be one .
will wants you on this ?
yeah .
okay . help kalinda .
he didn &apos;t want to leave a message .
he said he &apos;d try later .
okay .
anything you want to share ?
no .
you &apos;re the mustard seed ?
you have a problem with that ?
ms. flores ?
is it time ?
is it ...
oh , no , uh , um , i- i &apos;m mr. gold .
we talked on the phone .
victoria adler referred me .
oh , yeah , uh , vicki .
i just , i just have to get ... to get this trade off .
the stock market ?
shenzhen exchange .
it just opened .
oh , no , no , no , don &apos;t do that .
come on , come on , come on .
yes .
my senior project .
i &apos;m trying to prove
that the next great financial bubble is in pharmaceuticals .
foreign money flooding into cdos ,
based on fda clearances of drug studies .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m a nanny , too .
but if you want ,
i can manage your money .
oh , i ...
i &apos;m joking .
and ...
i just shorted mrg .
okay , uh , mr. gold , uh , what can i do for you ?
well , as i said on the phone , i have two children .
ages ... ?
six and eight .
names ?
peter ... and alicia .
and you want tutoring , too ?
i ... no .
yeah . i guess .
if @-@ if that &apos;s possible .
it would have to work around my graduate degree .
oh , i understand .
can i ask you about your most recent employment ?
you can .
i worked for the same family
for the last five years ... two daughters .
okay . and ,
i hate to have to ask you this , but ,
you know ...
it &apos;s okay .
vicki said that i could talk to you .
i was born in nayarit , mexico .
my parents came here when i was two .
but i am working with a lawyer on my citizenship .
all i &apos;ve ever known is america .
can i have the lawyer &apos;s name , just to check details ?
sure .
he says it could be a year before i get my citizenship ,
but ,
i will let him know that you &apos;re calling .
give me a call , mr. gold .
i &apos;m very good with kids .
i don &apos;t doubt that for a second , ms. flores .
and good luck with your thesis .
i did mine on the savings and loan meltdown ,
a long time ...
1986 .
you were an economics major ?
i was , many a moon ago .
do you miss it ?
uh , economics , no , no .
it &apos;s too messy for me .
so , you went into ... ?
party planning .
i would think that party planning
could get pretty darn messy .
depends on the party .
a @-@ anyway , i got to go .
the center camera ?
bank robber shot it out ,
so i synched up the two outlying cameras .
so , the front of the bank is here ?
come on , will you two just bury the hatchet ?
what hatchet ?
i was considering mrs. florrick &apos;s fine question .
look , childs wants me to show you guys everything
because beltran &apos;s lawyers are coming after us next .
so , yes .
bank was here , mrs. florrick .
it was well organized .
they had assault weapons ...
they tried to make off with $ 800,000 .
now , there &apos;s beltran .
and there &apos;s officer walter .
12 @-@ year veteran , father of five .
here it comes .
the bullet went through his body .
mcveigh discovered the nine @-@ millimeter
bullet fragment there on the facing wall .
he determined from direction of fire
that only beltran could have fired it .
so ... either you &apos;re looking at an innocent man ,
or someone who just got away with murder .
think of ballistics as both a science and an art .
see , that &apos;s what i say to a jury first .
they love it when i compare it to something they know .
you see , an artist works with paints and brushes .
a ballistics expert works with direction and metal .
bullets .
you see , it &apos;s not so simple .
over 500 rounds .
most crime scenes , they are two rounds , five rounds ,
what have you .
not so hard .
you disagree ?
i just need to get some air .
no .
you think i am unworthy of you .
i think you have a gimmick .
i think you play up the whole ...
ancient chinese wisdom thing
to deflect from your lack of ability .
okay , i don &apos;t think that ...
my lack of ability is willing to help you .
do you not want my help ?
we want your help .
hey , jimmy patrick back with you ,
with my main man , j.t. , behind the camera .
we are the mustard seeds .
deal with it . hey !
time to get real here .
because jesus didn &apos;t come to bring peace ,
he came to bring a sword .
jesus says ,
&quot; for i came to set a man against his father ,
and a daughter against her mother .
he who loves mother and father more than me
is not worthy .
amen !
last week i told you that jesus is not
a republican or a democrat ,
he hates global warming ,
he hates polluters .
jesus doesn &apos;t want you to stay off drugs
or get an &quot; a. &quot;
he could give a crap .
he &apos;s the first rebel .
he wants you to question your parents .
he wants you to get in the face of authority .
he wants anarchy .
okay , thank you . bye .
was that her lawyer ?
natalie &apos;s lawyer , yes .
and ?
he &apos;s toying with her . it &apos;s a citizenship mill .
he &apos;s trying to make money out of her .
but that &apos;s good , right ? i mean ,
it &apos;s better for the story if she &apos;s not a citizen .
she &apos;ll be deported .
right , back to mexico . and ?
you &apos;re right .
do the polling ; get it ready .
they &apos;ll put you on the stand first ,
because they want to play on your ego .
they want you to defend your findings .
just allow for doubt in your investigations , that &apos;s all .
you don &apos;t have to say you were wrong .
just say there was
an 80 % probability or something like that .
i know this is hard .
you want to fire it ?
i was a pretty good shot .
fire it .
no .
why is there this attraction to guns ?
i don &apos;t understand it .
this is an austrian bullpup 5.56 @-@ millimeter assault rifle .
here , try .
it &apos;s just so base .
now , brace it against your shoulder .
it &apos;s a two @-@ stage trigger , half for semi @-@ automatic ,
full for automatic .
i can &apos;t sleep with you .
okay .
i &apos;m your lawyer ; it &apos;s unethical .
what &apos;s that piece of paper ?
the retainer agreement .
i haven &apos;t signed it .
not yet .
ms. lockhart ?
the retainer ?
did you sign it ?
not yet .
have you ever met my client , mr. jason beltran ?
no , i saw him in court , but that &apos;s about it .
at his criminal trial ,
the trial that &apos;s since been overturned .
but to be accurate , i believe the verdict was vacated ,
and the state &apos;s attorney declined to reprosecute .
then you don &apos;t agree with the vacating of that sentence ?
no , i think that the legal process
was ... probably just .
because of this one .
if that &apos;s rosalie torrance ,
yes , i think you &apos;re right .
then you &apos;ve never met her ,
the lab tech that falsified evidence against my client .
no , i talked to her on the phone .
but you know that she accidentally destroyed
forensic evidence collected at the crime scene
and then later falsified it to frame my client .
i do know that , and i do know that
she &apos;s being prosecuted for those falsifications .
and isn &apos;t it true that when she called you
to tell you about her findings , you changed your own findings ?
no .
no ? so why &apos;d you change your findings ?
objection !
huh ? on what grounds ?
argumentative ?
because mr. mcveigh was asked
whether he changed his findings ,
but that has not yet been determined by the facts .
i see . sustained .
but you originally concluded
that my client did not fire the gun .
isn &apos;t that correct , mr. mcveigh ?
no .
i try to avoid early conclusions .
in all my investigations , there is an element of doubt .
i &apos;m only 80 %
sure of anything .
mr. mcveigh ,
are you a member of the tea party ?
objection , your honor .
your honor , it is our contention
that my client &apos;s prosecution was racist .
we believe
that mr. mcveigh &apos;s membership in a racist organization ...
oh , come on . the tea party is racist ?
let mrs. lockhart argue the opposite .
ms. lockhart .
yeah , what did i say ?
mrs.
my apologies . i was confused .
your honor ?
i &apos;m thinking !
overruled . proceed .
is that a photo of you at a tea party rally
in milwaukee last january ?
yes , it is .
would you read to us the sign
that that man is holding next to you ?
your honor , my client is not holding that sign ,
and i would contest that he is next to him .
i think , uh , the jury can see that , mrs. lockhart .
that sign ?
it appears to read , &quot; go back to the jungle . &quot;
and that refers to our current president ?
i can &apos;t say that for certain .
i assume that &apos;s correct .
how many african @-@ americans
have you testified against , mr. mcveigh ?
how many accused ?
yeah .
i can &apos;t speak accurately to that .
oh . well , i can .
eighty @-@ nine .
would you believe that ?
i would believe that .
and how many white accused have you testified against ?
my guess is that it would be less .
it is less . 22 .
an even 22 .
so , i would guess that my client never had a chance .
objection , your honor !
your honor ?
i heard you .
sustained .
you need to talk to the nanny again .
why ?
there &apos;s sympathy for wendy needing a nanny
among women 18 to 49 .
then we can &apos;t use it .
no , we can use it , but we need to find out
if wendy fired the nanny because of the campaign .
voters lose sympathy if she fired her for political reasons .
see ?
that &apos;s the silver bullet . it &apos;s always the same .
it &apos;s not the act . it &apos;s the cover @-@ up .
you need to go back to the nanny
and find out why she was let go .
i &apos;ll go ask .
mr. mcveigh ,
tell me about the tea party .
it &apos;s a political movement made up of
conservatives and libertarians intending to apply pressure
to the government to reduce spending .
is it racist ?
no .
are there racists and extremists within it ?
yes .
are there racists and extremists within the democratic party ?
objection . relevance .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
the question of whether there are racists
in the democratic party is not relevant , your honor .
sustained .
but i , uh ...
yeah , okay , go ahead .
why do you belong to the tea party ?
i think the government
is encroaching too much into my life .
isn &apos;t the tea party primarily anti @-@ obama ?
no .
then why wasn &apos;t it formed under george w. bush ?
there was hope that president bush would cut spending .
really ?
i would acknowledge
that it was a slim hope and a thwarted hope ,
but the tea party is not about obama .
it &apos;s about putting pressure on both parties to reduce .
because we &apos;re being bankrupted ?
yes .
that &apos;s all , your honor .
well , i think that worked .
i mean , it was painful , but it worked .
what &apos;s wrong ?
go away !
but she hasn &apos;t lost perspective ?
no . she &apos;s fighting harder .
unfortunately , i need her to fight harder at work , too .
why do you hate jesus ?
i don &apos;t hate jesus .
i think jesus is someone who lived 2,000 years ago
and has very little to do with me .
i think you either hate jesus , or you love him .
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s an in between .
and why do you need wine to discuss this ?
i don &apos;t need wine .
i like wine .
i like a glass of wine after work .
but you talk to me all the time about drugs .
wine is a drug .
very adult .
yup .
over 21 , that &apos;s me .
you treat me like a kid .
you are a kid .
i &apos;m not thinking like a kid .
so you &apos;re a mustard seed ?
i think jesus is someone i want to know more about .
i think science isn &apos;t taking prayer seriously enough .
i think global warming &apos;s real .
and i don &apos;t think believing in jesus means
believing global warming doesn &apos;t exist .
just taking another hit off the crack pipe .
i liked it more when you didn &apos;t work .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
i &apos;m not not going to work .
what is this about ... shannon ?
why does this have to be about shannon ?
i &apos;m a thinking person .
i &apos;m thinking about jesus , okay ?
so , you &apos;re becoming a christian ?
no .
i don &apos;t know .
i just don &apos;t like the way that you smirk at it .
i don &apos;t think i do smirk at it .
i just can &apos;t figure out
when one cause begins with you and another ends .
jesus is not a cause .
he &apos;s the source of causes .
okay .
you &apos;re rebelling .
that &apos;s what this is about .
so , when you can figure out
what it is you believe in ,
let me know , and we &apos;ll talk , okay ?
well , jesus was the first rebel .
well , then , maybe jesus can pay the rent every month .
consider the lilies of the field .
they neither toil ...
yeah ?
all right , so , you &apos;re not gonna like this .
a month before the bank robbery shootout ,
there was this attempted suicide @-@ by @-@ cop .
a bank customer took a shot at a cop
to try and get the cop to kill him .
uh , hang on , cary .
that man ... he &apos;s calling again .
tell him this .
if he leaves me a number , i &apos;ll call him back .
and if he doesn &apos;t leave me a number ,
then i won &apos;t call him back .
yeah .
the cop didn &apos;t return fire . that &apos;s why he didn &apos;t report it .
i only found out about it when something seemed weird
about this nine millimeter shell fragment .
mcveigh included this nine millimeter
shell fragment in his analysis .
he thought it was part of the bullet to the officer .
so he screwed up ?
yeah .
now , on the bright side , it wasn &apos;t his screwup .
he was never told of this attempted suicide @-@ by @-@ cop .
thanks , but i don &apos;t think this is a guy
who can deal with a bright side .
see you .
his number .
hey .
we found your mistake .
the nine millimeter fragment you found
was from an earlier crime .
so , what are we shorting today ?
a new biomed ipo out of boston .
i want to talk to you .
and i have a few questions for you , too .
natalie !
is everything okay ?
what are you really after ?
what am i ... ?
you don &apos;t want a nanny .
why would you say that ?
you called my lawyer , and you scared him .
he says now he &apos;s serious about working on my citizenship .
i thought he was serious before .
he says , now it &apos;s gonna take two months . not a year .
i felt he was cheating you .
when i called him ,
and i told him that he should not cheat you ,
and i told him that he should not tell you i called .
yes , well , he doesn &apos;t seem quite trustworthy .
so ... what is it you want from me ?
i don &apos;t know .
i have a boyfriend .
or i had a boyfriend .
he joined a circus .
a cirque du soleil circus .
he &apos;s a contortionist .
he &apos;s a french @-@ canadian contortionist .
he gets very angry when i laugh at him .
but , um ...
thank you for helping me ,
but i ...
you know , i &apos;m in a very precarious position ,
and i can &apos;t ...
no , no , no . i @-@ i don &apos;t ...
would you wait just one moment ?
hello ?
oh , yeah ?
yeah . uh , no , no , don &apos;t worry .
next time . okay .
you have to go ?
no , no . i @-@ i ...
someone &apos;s canceling dinner plans .
look , i get it .
uh , you have a boyfriend , and i am much older than you .
and i have a dinner reservation
that i really should cancel .
and i know i can &apos;t ...
i &apos;m sorry .
that was me trying to do a contortionist thing .
yup .
it &apos;s a downloaded file , right ?
the dvd you made for the beltran case ?
the dvd the cops gave to mcveigh ...
it &apos;s from a digital file .
uh ... yeah , i guess . why ?
can you get me the original analogue surveillance footage ?
it &apos;s late , kalinda .
why would i do that ?
because a compressed file drops frames ,
and i need to see every frame .
thank you for coming .
why wouldn &apos;t i ?
you &apos;re young .
yep .
the future .
i want to understand the young .
you talk like a newspaper .
oh , and that &apos;s the worst thing to be , right ?
someone who talks like a newspaper ?
well , it &apos;s not good .
hello , there .
well , hello , marissa .
i thought you couldn &apos;t make it .
change of plans , dad .
how are you ?
i &apos;m natalie .
hi , natalie .
hi .
so , you &apos;re the reason my dad sounds so happy .
marissa ...
yeah , i guess i am .
and how old are you ?
i &apos;m young .
i &apos;m , oh , so young .
and how old are you ?
i am so going to israel .
do you want to join us ? we could get another chair .
oh , no . i &apos;ll let you two eat in peace .
love you , dad .
don &apos;t forget protection .
well , wasn &apos;t that fun ?
yep .
so is @-@ is that your six @-@ year @-@ old ?
sorry .
no . i googled you
after you left .
you work for peter florrick .
and my old boss is wendy scott @-@ carr ,
and your questions about me being a nanny ,
those are for this campaign .
not party planning .
yes .
what i don &apos;t understand is ,
why would you pressure my lawyer into helping me
if the whole point was to expose me ?
because i &apos;m a hypocrite .
it would have been nice if you were a party planner .
i really liked the idea of that .
you don &apos;t have to go .
all right . so that &apos;s the original .
what are you looking for ?
what ?
there .
a ricochet .
how did i miss it ?
the police gave you a copy of the surveillance tape
from a compressed file .
a truck was passing behind the police officer
and a ricochet is visible .
you had the right conclusion ,
but the wrong bullet .
a ricochet to where ?
i don &apos;t know .
i thought you could find out .
when this is over , let &apos;s go away .
away ? what ? to where ?
costa rica .
i like it .
no , i can &apos;t do that .
you can .
well , no . i mean , not now .
i have a fight at work .
i can &apos;t give up on it .
if we don &apos;t do it now , we never will .
and ...
what would we do ?
make a life .
put our lives first .
was that a proposal ?
i would like to go away for a while with you .
if it sounds better as a proposal ,
then it &apos;s a proposal .
that is a gunshot .
it distorts all sound around it .
now imagine 500 .
and then this is what is surprising .
through all that ...
your honor , may i see the new evidence ?
of course . uh , sheriff ?
through all that , mr. mcveigh could determine
the entry wound was nine millimeters .
you &apos;re holding the bullet that was just discovered yesterday ?
yes .
nine millimeters .
it ricocheted off passing truck .
and where was it discovered ?
in drywall .
covered in new plaster .
and this bullet was determined
to have been fired from mr. beltran &apos;s position ?
yes .
only direction it could be fired from .
excuse my accent .
when i get passionate , my accent comes out more .
no . you drop the case .
that won &apos;t happen .
it will happen .
your client &apos;s lucky he &apos;s not back in prison .
it &apos;s not luck .
it &apos;s the bill of rights . double jeopardy .
and so he should count himself lucky and go home and watch tv .
because he pushes this trial , he &apos;s not only going to lose ,
he &apos;s going to have the police making his life hell .
you want to say that again so i can get that on tape ?
no , i want to say it again
so you can understand my words . you lost .
huh . beltran is guilty
and he &apos;s not going to make any money from this ,
because i will make it my life &apos;s work
to keep him from making money from this .
do you understand me ?
this is not the diane i know .
you &apos;re right about that .
nice to meet you .
it &apos;s out .
i see that .
it &apos;s even better .
she took a friend &apos;s social security number to get into school .
wendy might have helped her .
that is awesome .
it was the right thing to do , eli .
i &apos;ll go crack open the champagne .
a hobbled wendy scott @-@ carr
can clearly revive the lagging campaign prospects
of ex @-@ state &apos;s attorney peter florrick .
the once incorruptible image of the populist saint
hell @-@ bent on cleaning has given way ...
what do you want ?
what do you mean ?
religion ... what do you want from me ?
um , you and dad don &apos;t go to church .
i don &apos;t go to church .
dad has pastor isaiah .
yeah , but i want to go to church .
okay . which one ?
um , i don &apos;t know .
i want to help you here , grace ,
but this is a new area for me .
and i don &apos;t know why it makes me uncomfortable ,
but it makes me uncomfortable .
it &apos;s because of your generation .
okay . maybe .
do you want me to drive you to church on sunday ?
okay . sure .
okay . you pick a church , and i will take you .
and here .
i thought if you were going to be serious about it ,
you should read up .
i &apos;m going to bed .
after i score some crack .
are you sure ?
yes .
i can &apos;t leave here now .
then you &apos;ll never leave here .
maybe .
but i made that decision a long time ago .
come on .
let &apos;s go .
then i have to go .
kurt .
palin 2012 .
you &apos;re my hero .
we need all the equity partners there .
everybody on the same page .
hello , diane .
derrick .
