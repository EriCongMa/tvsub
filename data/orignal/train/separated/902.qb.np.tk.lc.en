back in the day , trick @-@ or @-@ treating was my jam .
i &apos;d spend months making the most epic holloween costumes
the &apos; 80s had ever seen .
i was a master of tape and glue @-@ gunning .
my costumes were not only awesome ,
but they were also topical .
i &apos;m the coolest e.t. ever .
and i &apos;m elliot , e.t. &apos; s owner !
... until my mom turned them into couples costumes .
look out , jenkintown .
here comes a ghostbuster !
it was embarrassing .
and i &apos;m his stay puft marshmallow mom .
and every year , it got worse .
freeze , creep . i &apos;m robocop .
and i &apos;m ed @-@ 209 , omnicorp &apos;s first foray into robotic policing .
i &apos;m indy !
... and it got more frustrating .
and i &apos;m mork .
i thought you said you were going as mindy .
why would i be going as mindy ?
well , i guess we &apos;re mork and indy .
but not this year .
my girl was in town , and she &apos;d be the ripley to my alien .
i love us .
me too .
which i why i want you to have this .
oh , my god .
our promise ring .
i know you gave it back when you moved ,
but i think we &apos;ve proved nothing can stand between us .
hey , boopie .
what the hell ? !
it &apos;s me . it &apos;s mama . i &apos;m the predator .
stop it .
the predator doesn &apos;t talk with smooches .
he clicks .
well , this predator kisses instead of kills .
you &apos;re ruining the property .
or is preda @-@ mom making it better ?
i told you , this year , i &apos;m doing a couples costume
with the person i &apos;m actually in a couple with .
hi , mrs. goldberg .
dana . look .
your alien movie has nothing to do with my costume ,
at least not that i know of .
god .
what ?
oh , my god . what is --
it &apos;s your favorite comic book , &quot; alien versus predator &quot; ?
now , when did these two get to know each other ?
you said our costume was mom @-@ proof .
i forgot about the crossover .
this is a very happy coincidence .
we &apos;re gonna make quite the trio .
no . you are not following us around tonight in that costume .
you want me to follow you around without a costume ?
come on . i &apos;m gonna look crazy .
i don &apos;t need my mom &apos;s help to go trick @-@ or @-@ treating .
i &apos;m going with dana .
not you .
oh . okay .
i guess i &apos;ll just go .
have a good time without me .
if you need me , just call my name ...
for anything .
or i could just stay if you want .
did someone call me ?
i thought i heard , &quot; please don &apos;t go . &quot;
no ?
is there another way out of here ?
nope .
call if you need me .
it was october 31 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my siblings were hard at work
strategizing how to beat halloween .
okay , here &apos;s our path through jenkintown .
first , we hit tom mcfadden &apos;s kegger ,
then we head north and hit these three parties .
ooh , are you planning a candy route ?
we should combine our data .
may i ?
you may .
nerd punch !
what was that for ?
dude ! your girlfriend came across the ocean to be with you .
dana lives in seattle .
exactly . do you really think
she wants to spend her one night in america
collecting candy like a little toddler ?
but that &apos;s w @-@ what we always do .
it &apos;s what you did . you &apos;re adults now .
just listen to your deep , yet still high weird voice .
hurtful , but continue .
it &apos;s halloween , dude -- a night for romance .
this holiday &apos;s all about girls getting scared
and running to a big , strong man for protection .
it &apos;s evolution .
idiot punch .
but he &apos;s got a point .
we do pretend to be scared to make it easy for boys
because we feel bad for them .
wow . okay .
so i should take her someplace scary .
like jcpenney ?
what ?
they put a bunch of spider webs up in their mattress display .
you know they &apos;re fake , but they make you think ,
&quot; what if my bed had spiders ? &quot;
oh , my god , no .
there &apos;s a frat at villanova
that runs an awesome haunted house .
take her there .
what ? you want me to pay money to get tortured
when candy is free ?
nut up , bro .
it &apos;s just a stupid haunted house .
you &apos;ll be fine .
hey . ready to head out ?
uh , yeah . question .
what would you rather do tonight --
get unlimited free nougaty candy ...
... or go to a haunted house ?
what ?
or go to a haunted house ?
what ?
free candy ?
or go to a lame haunted house -- super @-@ boring ?
a haunted house does sound cool ,
although , i might need you to protect me .
told you .
haunted house it is .
hopefully they have friendly ghosts like casper .
actually , casper weirds me out , too .
nerd punch !
as i was facing my first grown @-@ up halloween ,
my mom was facing her first one alone .
what are you up to ?
hiding a deadly razor in some candy .
okay .
don &apos;t you judge me .
i &apos;m just creating a visual aid
to show adam the dangers of getting candy from strangers
without his mother .
see ? this used to be fun @-@ size .
now it &apos;s terror @-@ size .
you know what &apos;s terrifying ?
the fact that you still want to go trick @-@ or @-@ treating
in matching costumes with your almost @-@ adult son .
i don &apos;t want to .
i have to for his safety .
halloween is a night where gangs of street toughs
roam the sidewalks looking to rough up children
and take their candy .
street toughs ?
in jenkintown ?
they drive in .
and don &apos;t even get me started on the kidnappers .
they hitch a ride with the street toughs .
so they &apos;re all carpooling .
maybe they &apos;re taking the bus .
what kind of bus is this ?
the point is , i don &apos;t do this for me .
trick @-@ or @-@ treating is a nightmare ,
and i can &apos;t wait for adam to give it up .
hey , ma , me and dana decided
to go to a haunted house this year .
we &apos;ll be back by 9 : 00 .
but what about trick @-@ or @-@ treating ?
i have a visual aid to prove a point
that now doesn &apos;t matter .
yeah , we &apos;re over it .
but -- we always --
we al-- we always --
candy .
just go .
well , there you go , bevy .
nightmare &apos;s over .
yeah . this is just what i wanted .
maybe i &apos;ll make myself useful by dusting
or by ... sitting in my room in the dark
to save on electricity .
i &apos;ll figure something out .
could i eat that ?
well , that &apos;s never stopped me before .
moron !
there &apos;s a razor in it .
you win this round , old man .
while my mom &apos;s halloween was falling apart ,
mine was coming together .
i love this ring .
i &apos;ll never take it off again .
besides being a beautiful symbol of our love ,
that bad boy really makes your eyes pop .
i didn &apos;t think this was gonna be so scary .
don &apos;t worry , girl . ad @-@ rock &apos;s here to protect you .
yep , i was the man .
in that moment , i couldn &apos;t believe
i ever doubted barry and erica .
and then a moment later , i remembered why i did .
but since this was all for love ,
i knew i could handle some cobwebs and fog ...
... but not a werewolf ...
... or a dude with a chainsaw .
and so i used dana as a human shield ...
balls , balls , balls , balls !
... and then ditched her and ran for my life .
oh . hey . lost you in there . sup ?
hopefully she didn &apos;t notice .
you used me as a human shield .
she noticed .
babe , it -- it was just a goof .
as you ran out , you screamed &quot; kill her , not me ! &quot;
you got to commit hard to the bit , right ?
oh , god .
my ring &apos;s gone .
i must have lost it back there .
you got to go get it for me .
can i just get you a new one ?
i lied about it making your eyes pop .
it makes them look gross .
whatever .
are you mad ?
no .
i &apos;m just tired .
i actually think i &apos;m gonna go .
happy halloween .
she &apos;s not tired , bro .
it can taaaalk !
while my halloween had turned sour ,
pops was busy handing out sweets .
ooh ! look at you !
it &apos;s spider @-@ guy , strawberry flapjacks , and hey !
it &apos;s herman the frog .
wokkity ! wokkity !
everything you &apos;re saying is wrong .
enjoy !
oh , there she is . happy halloween , pumpkin !
there will be no more happy halloweens ,
not if i can &apos;t be out there with my little nub @-@ nub .
i assume that &apos;s adam .
adam is my nub @-@ nub , yes .
i don &apos;t care for nub @-@ nub .
it -- it sounds wrong to the ear .
it &apos;s just ... adam was the last one .
now what &apos;s the point to halloween ?
hey . you still got me .
come on , hand out some candy .
dad , have you been handing out this candy the whole time ?
yeah , why ?
uh , where is my deadly candy bar ?
what &apos;s happening ?
where &apos;s my deadly razor candy bar ?
what &apos;s happening ?
i jammed a lady razor into a delicious treat
to show adam any crazy person could do it .
why would you do that ?
you know what a safety nut i am !
i did it for safety !
that is the opposite of safety !
i know !
oh , god . i got to go find it !
i must save the children !
and save them she would .
safety check !
give me your candy .
no .
i &apos;m not asking , i &apos;m taking .
give it .
no !
give it !
young man !
young man .
i &apos;m not a street tough , i &apos;m a concerned mama .
i &apos;m here for safety .
run towards safety .
run towards safety and away from the razors .
spider @-@ man , give me your candy !
i &apos;m saving lives .
i &apos;m saving lives !
halloween was in full swing
and the night would be more trick than treat .
yo ! guess who i am .
bruce lee ?
what ? no !
i &apos;m chuck norris !
oh , yeah .
it &apos;s kind of hard to read . can i fix it ?
please do .
perfect .
you &apos;re a good person .
thanks for nothing , jerks !
you ruined my halloween , you ruined my relationship ,
and you ruined my underpants .
i haven &apos;t actually checked yet , but i know what i &apos;m in for !
can we do this later ?
suck norris and i have several parties to hit .
what ?
no , you can &apos;t go .
i took your stupid advice , and i freaked out
in that haunted house like a scared little baby .
dude , it &apos;s not our fault you &apos;re a nervous , jumpy , wuss @-@ bag .
dana dropped her promise ring in that haunted house .
barry , you got to go in there and get it .
no way . we have six parties to hit .
come on , just help me .
you &apos;re always bragging
that you &apos;re literally not scared of anything on earth .
or stuff in the sky , like birds or meteors .
and you &apos;ve said many times
that you have the strength of 10 men .
and 44 medium @-@ sized children .
and you have claimed you &apos;re an unstoppable killing force .
i did karate kick a jellyfish at the beach that one time .
it stung pretty bad , but he floated away lifeless .
my god ! just go and do it already .
oh , fine .
i guess this is my burden to bear
since i &apos;m the one born with extra testosterone and no fear .
you &apos;ll really help me ?
dude , if anyone can find that ring , it &apos;s this guy .
as i was in search of my ring ,
my mom was hunting down her razor candy .
i &apos;m home ! come quick , i need your help .
holy crap !
did you take all that
from the tiny hands of little children ?
and this .
bevy , the razor &apos;s not in there .
but it might be in here .
i threw it away !
you power @-@ walked out of here like a panther !
we couldn &apos;t find you !
well , this is ... concerning .
you -- you have another bag , don &apos;t you ?
she did .
she also had three more in the car .
heavy . i got it .
how far did you walk ? !
well , i didn &apos;t know if that razor made it to the next town .
i had to be sure .
and all those kids she stole candy from
were for sure gonna get their revenge ...
with a few dozen eggs .
what are they doing ?
egging our house !
which we deserve .
this is gonna stain our aluminum siding !
again , well @-@ deserved !
just give them the candy back .
the only thing they &apos;re getting is a lecture .
my mom stormed into the dark night
to defend our home against kermit the frog
and strawberry shortcake .
this ... is a waste ... of groceries !
but it became an alien standoff --
predator versus alf .
look both ways when you cross the street !
turns out , years of power @-@ walking
made her a power @-@ runner ,
and alf &apos;s little legs were no match
for my angry smother .
hey , bar , we don &apos;t say this stuff much ,
but you &apos;re a good brother for going in there for me .
yeah , yeah .
thanks , i &apos;m just gonna -- yeah , yeah .
are you okay , man ?
of course i &apos;m okay .
why wouldn &apos;t i be okay ? i &apos;m an adult .
aah ! what was that ?
are you okay , man ? !
yeah ! i just had the bravery shakes , god .
what &apos;s happening with you right now ?
look , i know for some reason
you think i have extra testosterone and no fear .
yeah , &apos; cause you &apos;ve said those exact words
for the last 10 years .
right , but the truth is ,
i actually have a normal amount of testosterone
and a tremendous amount of fear .
then why would you say it ?
i say it &apos; cause people finding out about my fear
is my greatest fear .
fine ! erica , you go in .
pass .
seriously ? you &apos;re scared of haunted houses , too ?
hell , no .
but there &apos;s a frat guy i made out with in there ,
and if i see him , i know i &apos;ll fall right back into it .
and that &apos;s my greatest fear ...
or at least something i would like to avoid .
come on ! safety in numbers !
we just have to stick together .
okay , let &apos;s do this .
but , wait !
how &apos;s my hair ?
good .
yeah .
and with that , the three of us faced our fears .
the plan was simple -- stick together at all costs .
yo , pretty , pretty .
hey , anton !
go , just go . leave me .
but what about sticking together ?
so , anton , did you like , um ,
lose my number or something ?
the ring &apos;s got to be around here somewhere .
my ankle !
adam , help me !
i can &apos;t hear you through the fog !
that &apos;s not how fog works !
goodbye , barry !
you were a terrible brother , but i love you !
that night , i wasn &apos;t the only one
facing an angry monster .
shame on you kids .
running around like hooligans in the night , egging my house .
your mothers have failed as mothers ,
and they are gonna be livid when i call them .
hello .
may i give you another take on this situation ?
not now . i &apos;m on a roll .
has it occurred to you that these children &apos;s parents
might think differently , given all the facts ?
it has not occurred to me
and will continue to not occur to me .
well , it occurs to me
you &apos;ve become everything you fear on halloween .
please . i have not .
you hid a razor in a chocolate bar .
to prove a point .
you stole candy from children like a street tough .
to protect them .
and then there &apos;s the kidnappings .
all i did was round them up
and force them into my house and --
oh , my god , that is bad .
hiya , guys .
on your way out , you &apos;ll each find a bag of candy
that i put a $ 5 bill in ,
so maybe you shouldn &apos;t mention this to your parents .
and by the way , have a happy halloween .
your wife &apos;s nuts , dude .
oh , yeah .
kermit &apos;s right .
i really did lose it tonight .
it &apos;s just halloween . who cares ?
don &apos;t you understand what this night means to me ?
no matter how old adam got ,
he was always so happy when we would go out and get candy .
his smile , the excitement ,
his sweaty little hand reaching up to grab mine ,
and now his sweaty little hand is grabbing someone else &apos;s .
he &apos;ll never need me again .
you got anything savory ?
please leave .
that night , my mom realized
it was time to let go of her kids on halloween ,
and my dad realized he could help her through it .
look at me .
i &apos;m an alien man just like you . na @-@ nu , na @-@ nu .
what are you doing ? what is this ?
i thought , &quot; well , if you &apos;re in a couples costume ,
you might as well be with someone
you &apos;re in an actual couple with . &quot;
you put together this stupid thing for me ?
yeah , you know , i &apos;m not one for sentimental crap .
god ! son of a bitch !
just take it off .
i can &apos;t !
this is a child &apos;s helmet .
it &apos;s like sucking on my head .
my head &apos;s in a vacuum .
why would you just jam it on ?
the more you pull it off , the more it clamps !
why would you do this ? !
i just thought , you know ,
you can &apos;t have halloween with the kids anymore ,
and maybe you could have halloween with me .
that is so sweet .
and i would love that .
mama , i need you !
move !
boopie , what &apos;s wrong ? !
it &apos;s barry !
he twisted his ankle in the haunted house .
oh , no . where &apos;s erica ?
she &apos;s in there , too , with a frat boy named anton .
oh , hell , no !
all right , so we &apos;ll put a pin in the couples costume .
maybe after adam goes to college .
turns out , that night ,
the scariest thing in that haunted house was my mom .
what the ... ?
move it !
out of my way !
back off , punk !
mom kick !
mom slap !
you ! out !
damn it ! call me ?
do not call her !
dana &apos;s ring wasn &apos;t the only thing i found that night .
i also discovered
that my mom and i made quite the team .
i found the ring .
then go .
i &apos;ll stay and find your brother .
thanks , mama .
you got it , my little alien .
and even though that was our last couples costue ,
it turned out to be the best one ever .
as much as my mom savored
every single halloween when i was little ,
this was the one she &apos;d remember forever .
aah ! my ankle .
it &apos;s all right , love bug .
you &apos;re safe now .
you hear that , bar ? mom saved us .
we are the luckiest kids in the world .
you &apos;re grounded for a month .
for sure .
that &apos;s the thing about love .
when you face your fears ,
you can finally take off your mask
and show people who you really are .
sorry for using you as a human shield and all .
well , you went back in .
it was so scary in there .
it was , but losing you was even scarier .
you know , halloween isn &apos;t over .
it -- it &apos;s not too late to get some candy .
candy sounds great .
so my first adult halloween ended the way it always did --
with me and dana getting candy .
and it couldn &apos;t have been more perfect .
you gonna go keep him safe ?
actually , i think he &apos;ll be all right without me .
but watching from a distance can &apos;t hurt .
growing up , there &apos;s a lot to be afraid of ,
but when you know in your heart your family has your back ,
nothing in life is scary .
yo , man , this place is really crazy .
i know . god , it looks scary in the dark .
oh , this is so creepy .
look at the cobwebs .
what &apos;s that ?
what was that ? !
who wants waffles ?
kids , come on down !
here you go , murray .
oops . i almost forgot --
i need to get the kids &apos; lunch money .
mom &apos;s got to stop wearing her old halloween costume .
she won &apos;t .
whoever &apos;s standing there , let go of my purse .
her new perm didn &apos;t settle right .
she doesn &apos;t want anyone to see what &apos;s going on under there .
still getting the hang of this thing .
yeah , we should go .
help your mother .
you have 30 seconds to comply .
