my brother-- he &apos;s got a big crush on bernadette .
you &apos;re moving back to india ?
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s not what it looks like .
what does it look like ?
it &apos;s not what it looks like .
it &apos;s not what it looks like .
what are you grinding about ?
penny &apos;s brain teaser this morning .
she and koothrappali
emerge from your bedroom .
she is disheveled , and raj is dressed only in a sheet .
the sole clue : &quot; it &apos;s not what it looks like . &quot;
just let it go , sheldon .
if i could , i would , but i can &apos;t , so i shan &apos;t .
now , knowing penny ,
the obvious answer is , they engaged in coitus .
but ...
since that &apos;s what it looked like ,
we can rule that out .
let &apos;s put on our thinking cap , shall we ?
raj is from india , a tropical country .
third world hygiene .
parasitic infections are common , such as pinworms .
the procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait
until the subject is asleep ,
and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air .
yes , just like that .
penny could have been inspecting raj &apos;s anal region for parasites .
oh , boy .
that &apos;s a true blue friend .
they slept together , sherlock .
no , you weren &apos;t listening .
she said it &apos;s not what it looks like .
she lied .
oh .
don &apos;t i look silly sitting here wearing this ?
leonard , is it awkward for you
knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse
with a woman you used to love
in the very place you lay your head ?
no , i &apos;m fine with it .
that sounds like sarcasm ,
but i &apos;m going to disregard it ,
because i have an agenda-- paintball .
specifically , the interdepartmental tournament this weekend .
in order to function better as a fighting unit ,
i thought we should establish a chain of command .
now , it goes without saying
that i would outrank the three of you ,
but the question remains , by how much ?
now , i don &apos;t see me as some four @-@ star general , back at hq riding a desk
and playing golf with the secretary of defense .
but i also can &apos;t be sergeant cooper ,
because that might lead you
to think of me as just a regular joe .
this might take some thought . as you were .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
yeah , how could you do that ?
what is it to you ?
i got his back .
yeah , right . you &apos;re just jealous because it turns out
i &apos;m penny &apos;s number two choice after leonard .
hey , if i wasn &apos;t engaged to bernadette ,
that totally could have been me .
please . sheldon would have been before you ,
and he might not even have genitals !
why do you care so much ?
you &apos;re dating my sister ,
and penny and i are in love .
what ? !
gentlemen , if i may interject ,
i &apos;ve decided my rank will be captain .
if it &apos;s good enough for kirk , crunch and kangaroo ,
it &apos;s good enough for me .
you &apos;re not in love with penny .
yes , i am .
the god kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love .
who ?
he &apos;s the hindu version of cupid ,
but way better , because he rides a giant parrot .
raj , come on . you fall in love with any girl who smiles at you .
a month ago , you were writing poems about his fiance .
i &apos;m sorry . what ? !
rubbish . he &apos;s talking rubbish .
&quot; oh , bernadette , please play my clarinet . &quot;
that could have been about anyone .
besides , you have nothing to worry about ,
because now i &apos;m the dusky half of koothrapenny .
for the record , i do have genitals .
they &apos;re functional and aesthetically pleasing .
oh . coming .
yup , that &apos;s good .
wine glasses should have handles .
keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake .
smart idea considering how trampy you get
when you &apos;ve had a few .
you heard what i did ?
well , i heard who you did .
oh , my god ,
i screwed up everything .
i hurt leonard .
i hurt raj .
i mean , what is wrong with me ?
i feel like two totally different people--
dr. jekyll and mrs. whore .
don &apos;t be so hard on yourself .
do you know the story of catherine the great ?
no .
she ruled russia
in the late 1700s , and one night ,
when she was feeling particularly randy ,
she used an intricate system of pulleys
to have intimate relations with a horse .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry .
what does this have to do with me ?
she engaged in interspecies hanky @-@ panky ,
and people still call her &quot; great . &quot;
i &apos;m sure your reputation can survive
you shagging a little indian boy .
you jerk face !
what did you tell howard ? !
did you say there was something going on between us ?
because he thinks there is !
he &apos;s completely freaking out !
please , come in .
what the hell is wrong with you ? ! well ...
you were always so nice to me , i thought maybe you liked me .
i &apos;m nice to everyone !
i &apos;m sorry .
damn right , you &apos;re sorry !
and you tell howard there &apos;s never been anything between us !
i will . hey , bernadette ?
what ? !
do you think i have a shot with penny ?
of course you do . you &apos;re a cutie pie !
any girl would be lucky to have you !
you know , i &apos;ve done this before .
in kindergarten ,
i was supposed to marry jason sorensen at recess ,
but by the time my class got out there ,
he was already engaged to chelsea himmelfarb .
so what did i do ?
hung upside down from the monkey bars ,
let all the boys see my underpants .
you can &apos;t blame yourself .
when your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy ,
promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine .
we neurobiologists refer to this as the &quot; skank reflex . &quot;
you know what ?
let &apos;s get out of here .
where are we going ?
somewhere where no one &apos;s seen me naked .
we may have to drive awhile .
subtlety isn &apos;t her strong suit , is it ?
can i stay at your place for a few nights ?
really ?
a best friend sleepover ? yay .
yeah , sure . yay !
we &apos;ll make popcorn , stay up all night
and i &apos;ll teach you my secret language , op.
sounds great .
nope .
sounds &quot; gop rop e a top . &quot;
yeah , i &apos;m gonna go pack a bag .
no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re gonna &quot; pop a cop kop a bop a gop . &quot;
do we really have to wear this camouflage crap
to play paintball ?
who said that ?
leonard , i can hear your voice ,
but i can &apos;t see you .
i &apos;m not in the mood , sheldon .
oh , there you are !
leonard ,
i know you &apos;re upset about recent events , and
i have someone here to help .
i don &apos;t want to talk to amy .
no , it &apos;s not amy .
hello , dear .
you called my mother ?
oh , leonard ,
is it really necessary to caption the obvious ?
he &apos;s been like that since he was a toddler .
&quot; look , mommy-- a butterfly . &quot;
maddening .
what &apos;s going on ? what do you want ?
sheldon informed me
that you &apos;re experiencing an emotional upheaval ,
and i &apos;m here to help .
that &apos;s so nice .
and we &apos;re back to the obvious .
now , what &apos;s up ?
well , uh ... okay .
i don &apos;t want to get back together with penny .
we tried it , it was crazy , it didn &apos;t work ,
but i can &apos;t deal with the fact
that she slept with my friend raj .
and then i find out that raj &apos;s sister priya ,
who i &apos;ve been going out with for eight months ,
is moving back to india .
so i &apos;m just completely confused and alone .
i understand .
got any advice ?
yes . buck up .
excuse me .
you &apos;re a world @-@ renowned expert
in parenting and child development ,
and all you &apos;ve got is &quot; buck up &quot; ?
sorry .
buck up , sissy pants .
thanks , mother . i feel much better .
if you need any more help from me ,
my books are available on amazon .
logging off .
... ninety @-@ nine , one hundred .
it &apos;s like a waterfall of liquid gold .
my turn .
you know , i don &apos;t even know what the point
of me staying in l.a. is .
i haven &apos;t gotten a single acting job since i moved out here .
the closest i came was last month ,
i got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial .
oh , i could so see you being the face of hemorrhoids .
i know , right ?
maybe i should just move back to nebraska .
no , i can &apos;t let you do that .
why not ?
for the first time ever ,
i have a thriving social life .
and no pressure ,
but it kind of lives and dies with you .
hi , amy .
can i talk to penny ?
a guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door ?
i wish i could tell 13 @-@ year @-@ old me &quot; it does get better . &quot;
how did you know i was here ?
it &apos;s all over her facebook page .
i &apos;ll take your stuff to the bedroom
and clear out a drawer .
thanks .
no problem . try and keep it in your pants , okay ?
so , hi .
what &apos;s up ?
i was wondering if you &apos;re free friday .
they &apos;re having a totally &apos; 80s night at the greek .
hall &amp; oates , katrina and the waves
and three @-@ fifths of kajagoogoo .
gee , that &apos;s really sweet , but the thing is ...
aw , there &apos;s a thing .
look , honey , i was really drunk
and made a huge mistake last night .
we should &apos;ve never slept together .
it &apos;s what ruins friendships .
you can &apos;t ruin a friendship with sex .
that &apos;s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles .
come here .
just listen to me .
i want to go back to the way we were before .
you know , friends .
no sprinkles .
all right .
thank you .
as your friend , you might like to know that , um ...
we didn &apos;t have sex in the conventional sense .
oh , god .
did you pull some weird indian crap on me ?
no , no .
after we got undressed and jumped in bed ,
you @-@ you asked if i had protection .
oh , you did , didn &apos;t you ?
of course . i &apos;m always packing .
anyway ,
um , i had trouble putting it on
and you tried to help and ...
that was all she wrote .
so , we didn &apos;t actually ...
i did .
it was beautiful .
penny , please , please promise me
you won &apos;t tell anybody about this .
of course i won &apos;t . no , i won &apos;t .
oh , good .
um , can i tell people that our love
burned too bright and too quickly ?
kind of a &quot; candle in the wind &quot; deal ?
sure .
cool . can i say it fell apart
because you were all &quot; i want to have your babies &quot; &quot;
and i was like &quot; i &apos;m too rock and roll to be tied down &quot; ?
no .
can i say i ruined you for white men ?
also no .
okay , just the candle thing .
yeah .
cool .
all right ... friend .
i &apos;ll see you around .
okay .
raj , wait .
thank you for being my friend .
penny ?
it &apos;s getting beautiful again .
all right , this is a google earth view of the field of battle .
i don &apos;t see anything .
give it a second to load .
whenever you &apos;re ready , at &amp; t !
okay , here we go .
this is us here .
to the south is professor loomis and the geology department .
according to their twitter feed , they &apos;re out of sunblock ,
which means they &apos;ll have to hug the tree line
or risk melanoma .
that &apos;s our edge .
all we have to do is move quickly over this ridge ,
the rock @-@ worshipping pasty @-@ faced bastards
won &apos;t know what hit them !
all right , let &apos;s move out .
hang on , sheldon .
how could you not tell me your sister was moving back to india ?
maybe he was too busy
writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiance .
screw you .
that was a beautifully written penis metaphor .
you know what , guys , i &apos;m not in the mood for paintball .
what do you say we just bag it ?
fine with me .
sure , whatever .
you can &apos;t quit .
that &apos;s a court @-@ martial offense .
that &apos;s punishable by ...
you can &apos;t quit .
sorry , sheldon ,
it &apos;s just not a good time for playing games .
this is a game to you ?
uh , was the battle of antietam a game ?
huh ? was the sack of rome a game ?
yes , no and no .
wait .
i just want you all to know that i forgive you .
this mutiny isn &apos;t your fault ,
it &apos;s mine .
i haven &apos;t earned these bars .
although what i lack in leadership ,
apparently i more than make up for in sewing .
let it go , sheldon .
i &apos;ll get you a jamba juice on the way home .
no .
jamba juice is for heroes .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to be .
what are you doing ?
following in the footsteps of kirk , crunch and kangaroo .
geology isn &apos;t a real science !
damn those sons of bitches !
let &apos;s get &apos; em !
eat paint !
if there &apos;s ever a church of sheldon ,
this will be when it started .
ow !
i &apos;d like to propose a toast
to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory ,
captain sheldon cooper .
hear , hear .
hear , hear .
excuse me . it &apos;s major sheldon cooper .
with my last breath ,
i awarded myself a battlefield promotion .
it &apos;s kind of a big deal .
hi . you guys have a minute ?
uh , yeah , sure .
okay .
well , i already talked to raj ,
but i wanted to apologize to the rest of you for ,
you know , everything .
please , penny , let me .
we &apos;ve decided to let our crazy , wonderful night together
be just one of those memories you have
and can call to mind when you &apos;re feeling blue
or you &apos;re in the shower .
hey , what you doing , quick draw ?
sorry . go on .
anyways , i wanted you guys all to know
that i &apos;ve been taking a really hard look at things
and come to the conclusion
i have to stop kidding myself .
i suck at acting .
it &apos;s time for me to move back to nebraska .
you &apos;re leaving ?
yeah .
what are you going to do in nebraska ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe teach acting .
oh , sorry . hold on .
hello ?
penny , listen , i hope you &apos;re not doing this &apos; cause of you and me ,
because i have a girlfriend , and you &apos;re a single woman ...
shh ! it &apos;s my agent , it &apos;s my agent .
you &apos;re kidding .
oh , my gosh .
i can &apos;t believe it ! really ? !
oh , i &apos;m so excited !
thank you !
thank you so much .
okay , bye .
i got the hemorrhoid commercial !
i start monday !
what about nebraska ?
oh , hell with nebraska .
i &apos;m gonna be a star !
have you ever thought of teaching physics ?
ready to ride ?
i don &apos;t think so , mom .
not today .
oh , sweetie .
hemorrhoids acting up again ?
you don &apos;t know the half of it .
oh , yes , i do .
try a dab of this .
&quot; rose @-@ scented preparation @-@ h for women ? &quot;
now , the &quot; h &quot; is for &quot; her . &quot;
i &apos;m proud of you .
shh ! here comes my joke .
how you doing ?
