can i see the comics ?
this is the new york times .
okay , may i see the comics ?
i thought you were taking ross to the game .
we are . he &apos;s meeting us here .
no , rachel &apos;s meeting us here !
come on ! they can be in the same room .
you should &apos;ve been there last night .
what happened ?
ross was hanging out at our place .
rachel comes over to borrow some moisturizer from chandler
how hard is it to say &quot; something &quot; ?
rachel came over to borrow &quot; something . &quot;
anyway , her and ross just started yelling at each other .
why was he yelling at her ? he slept with someone else .
he says they were on a break when it happened ...
... so she should &apos;ve forgiven him by now .
he is so unreasonable ! god !
although i understand what he means .
oh , my god ! this is like 60 minutes ...
... when at first you &apos;re mad that pharmaceutical company made the drug .
and then , you just feel bad for the people , because ...
... they needed to make their hair grow .
you know , this is like when my parents got divorced .
i hope ross doesn &apos;t try to kidnap me after cub scouts .
i dreamed that ross and rachel were still together .
and we were all hanging out and happy .
i had the same dream .
and nobody slept with the xerox girl .
oh , i had the opposite dream .
maybe it &apos;s gonna be okay . i mean , it &apos;s been a week .
it never takes me more than a week to get over a relationship .
it never takes you more than a shower to get over a relationship .
let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s hit the road . let &apos;s get the show on it .
let me get coffee .
i know the best coffeehouse . and it &apos;s close .
closer than here ?
oh , look ! i found coffee !
okay , let &apos;s skedaddle .
i &apos;m not gonna drink somebody &apos;s old coffee .
okay , your highness .
&quot; rachel , i &apos;m really sorry . &quot; &quot; okay , ross . wanna get back together ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , okay . &quot;
did anyone else hear that ?
the one without the ski trip
is he here ?
here &apos;s your moisturizer .
you guys are gonna love me ! okay , check it out .
thursday night , five tickets .
calvin klein lingerie show , and you guys are coming with me .
i said that out loud , right ?
yes , it &apos;s just that we kind of already ...
... made plans with ross .
well , okay .
well , there you go .
it &apos;s just , he got this new home @-@ theater dealy ...
... and he wants us to check it out .
he &apos;s excited about it too .
he even recorded showtimes on his answering machine .
we &apos;re sorry , honey .
oh , it &apos;s okay .
rach , it &apos;s not that we don &apos;t want to . really .
are we talking models in their underwear ?
and heels .
ross did ask us first , and we set that night aside .
come on . if he asked you first , it &apos;s only fair .
oh , boy , do i feel bad !
very bad .
chandler , what are you doing ?
oh , my god !
you &apos;re smoking again ?
well , actually , yesterday , i was smoking again .
today i &apos;m smoking , still .
why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum ?
this is just like my parents &apos; divorce ...
... which is when i first started smoking .
weren &apos;t you 9 ?
i &apos;m telling you something , that first smoke after naptime ....
that &apos;s great . with my luck , that &apos;s him .
him ? ross ?
no , &quot; hymn &quot; 253 : &quot; his eyes are on the sparrow . &quot;
when my parents got divorced , i started using humor as a defense mechanism .
hi . do you guys have weekend plans ?
because my sister says we can spend the weekend at her cabin , skiing .
i &apos;m asking you first , right ? i &apos;m playing by the rules .
absolutely .
chandler ! you &apos;re smoking ? what are you doing ?
shut up ! you &apos;re not my real mom !
could you close that window ? my nipples could cut glass !
really ? because mine get me out of tickets .
look , i just wanna say i really appreciate you spending time with me .
it &apos;s been a hard time right now , so i just want to say thanks .
somebody else hug him . i have to stay by the window .
how about this weekend , we have a laser @-@ disc marathon , okay ?
and maybe a tournament on my new ...
... dart board ! what do you think ?
two days of darts ! it &apos;ll be great !
it &apos;ll be great for next weekend .
this weekend , guys .
it &apos;ll be great for next weekend .
i mean , &quot; lt &apos;ll be great . &quot;
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re sort of invited to go skiing . you know , rachel &apos;s sister &apos;s cabin ?
so , for the whole weekend ?
we &apos;re really sorry , but she did ask us first .
that &apos;s okay . if you all have to go away ...
... for the first weekend i &apos;m alone by myself ...
... then i totally understand .
i can stay . i &apos;m gonna stay .
the last time i went , i was afraid to leave the chair lift .
i just went round and round .
we need you to drive us there in your grandmother &apos;s cab .
but you know what ? i &apos;ll stay .
no , i &apos;ll stay . he &apos;s my brother .
what , a &quot; pity stay &quot; ?
we &apos;re gonna have fun !
we can make fudge .
pity food ?
you know what ? i don &apos;t need any of you to stay .
nobody stays .
well , then , i might as well offer to stay .
does anybody else feel bad about ross ?
you think he &apos;s still mad ?
he &apos;s probably more mad since you called him to borrow his goggles .
what ? mine aren &apos;t tinted .
chandler what ?
what does the sign say ?
&quot; beam me up , jesus . &quot;
the &quot; no smoking &quot; sign .
there &apos;s no smoking in my grandmother &apos;s cab .
well , then , i have to go to the bathroom .
oh , please !
no unscheduled stops . you can go when we stop for gas .
there &apos;s a rest stop right up there . come on , i really have to go !
oh , now i have to go !
ls that all that it takes ? sometimes just a small breeze ....
here we go .
brace yourself !
what ?
aren &apos;t you gonna go ?
no , thanks .
rachel never pees in public restrooms .
they never have any paper in there .
so my rule is , &quot; no tissue , no tushy . &quot;
well , if everybody &apos;s going ....
don &apos;t close it ! the keys are in there !
what &apos;s going on ?
my lighter &apos;s in there !
damn ! the tailpipe &apos;s not hot enough to light this .
i can open this . anybody got a coat hanger ?
oh , i do .
no , i took it out of my shirt when i put it on this morning .
so if your parents hadn &apos;t divorced ...
... you &apos;d be able to answer a question like a normal person ?
look , i just need a wire something to jimmy it .
one of you give me your bra underwire .
come on ! who has the biggest boobs ?
whoever has the biggest boobs , has the biggest bra and wire .
no !
it &apos;s too expensive !
to get back in the car , we need that wire .
your call .
monica &apos;s are the biggest .
these tiny little non @-@ breasts ? please ! it &apos;s gotta be rachel .
no , mine are deceptively small .
i mean , i actually sometimes stuff my bra .
well , then , your bra would still be big .
no , i stuff outside the bra .
ladies , let &apos;s just compromise , okay ?
phoebe , rachel , take off monica &apos;s bra .
all right , forget it , never mind .
you can have mine .
thank you .
what are you doing ? there &apos;s a trash can right there .
i thought if i littered , that crying lndian might come by and save us .
there .
thank you , phoebe . that &apos;s very , very generous .
wow . this is nice . were you planning on meeting somebody up there ?
now , let &apos;s decide who has the nicest ass .
and there you go !
well , at least let me smoke it to the good part !
what &apos;s going on ?
what ?
yeah , this has happened before .
so you know how to fix it ?
yep . put more gas in .
hi . what are you doing here ?
i was wondering , when you and i split up ...
... did you get the tape that was half the last episode of m.a. s.h ...
... and half the hostages coming home ?
but now it &apos;s susan and me in mexico and the hostages coming home .
where &apos;s ben ?
he &apos;s sleeping .
is this a bad time ?
yeah , actually . susan &apos;s gonna be here any minute .
it &apos;s kind of an anniversary .
i thought you guys got married in january .
a different kind of anniversary .
so anyway
candles , champagne ....
yeah , anniversaries are great ...
... because love lasts forever , you know ?
there &apos;s nothing like it in this life . money in the bank .
so rachel and i broke up .
god , ross , i am so sorry !
you know what ?
i wanna talk about this so much ...
... but when we can really get into it .
you free for dinner tomorrow ?
i &apos;d love that .
me too .
i guess it all started when rachel got this new job .
triple a can pick us up .
what town are we near ?
fremont .
westmont .
westberg ?
why are you answering ?
do you know what route we &apos;re on ?
we are definitely on route 27 .
we are at a rest stop on route 27
there is no route 27 .
either 93 or 76 .
i don &apos;t know .
i always slept in the back when we drove here .
can you just send someone up and down 76 and check every rest stop ?
and also 93 ?
no , they don &apos;t do that .
somebody will come and save us .
who ? have you seen a car in the last hour and a half ?
we should call ross . maybe he can get a car to get us .
i am not getting in a car with ross !
we will just have to ...
... iive here !
but it &apos;s so cold .
no !
i won &apos;t get in a car with him . think of something else .
joey and chandler are back !
so the &quot; going for help &quot; went well ?
smokey joe here got halfway to the highway and collapsed .
i have the lung capacity of a 2 @-@ year @-@ old .
then why are you smoking ?
it &apos;s very unsettling .
right ? i mean , it &apos;s pretty unbelievable .
they just took off , without even looking back .
i don &apos;t need them . i &apos;ve got you guys now as friends .
you and susan .
susan will be so pleased .
seven @-@ one @-@ seven ?
where &apos;s 717 ?
you have more of these for susan , right ?
no , but that &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ll just put out pickles or something .
ross , thank god !
pheebs ?
why are you whispering ?
i ate a bug .
hey , rach ! the tampons here are only a penny .
let &apos;s stock up .
we &apos;re out of gas and don &apos;t know where we are so we can &apos;t get a tow truck .
now you want a favor ?
yes , please .
i &apos;m sorry your car broke down , pheebs ...
... but i &apos;m too busy with some of my real friends right now .
but please call to let me know you got home safely .
phoebe , hang on a second .
take my car . get your friends .
no , i won &apos;t pick them up .
we both know you &apos;ll do it , because you &apos;re not a jerk .
so you can sulk here for half an hour , then go get them ...
... or save time and sulk in the car .
rachel doesn &apos;t
i &apos;m sorry rachel dumped you for mark ...
... and you &apos;re the innocent victim in this .
but don &apos;t punish your friends for what rachel did .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
phoebe , hang on . ross wants to say something .
what ?
you slept with someone else ?
we were on a break !
we were
where are you ? i &apos;ll find you .
you slept with another woman ?
oh , you &apos;re one to talk .
okay , done !
what &apos;s &quot; pleh &quot; ?
that &apos;s &quot; help &quot; spelled backwards ...
... so that the helicopters can read it from the air .
what &apos;s &quot; dufus &quot; spelled backwards ?
car ! car !
oh , it &apos;s ross on one of his drives !
what is he doing here ?
he is saving your butt .
unless i &apos;m stepping on some toes here ...
... in which case i could just mosey on .
i have plenty of people to help on the interstate .
come on !
we need your help , please !
fine ! fine !
oh , no ! now it &apos;s not gonna make any sense .
you guys ...
... what do we do about ross ? he drove all the way up here .
just send him back , then we &apos;ll go skiing ?
this is horrible . it &apos;s just horrible .
should we ask ross to come along ?
but what about rachel ? how are we gonna even ask her ?
ask me what ?
if it might be okay if ross came skiing ?
no , i wasn &apos;t gonna ask that .
you guys are unbelievable . no , he cannot come !
excuse me ?
it &apos;s horrible !
oh , please ? can &apos;t i come to your special , magical cabin ?
why would you even want to come ? you &apos;re a horrible skier .
hitting me where it hurts ! my ski skills !
here we go again .
i can &apos;t handle this , you guys .
i can handle it . &quot; handle &quot; is my middle name .
actually , it &apos;s the middle part of my first name .
all right , pheebs , your cab &apos;s ready .
let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re welcome .
i &apos;m sorry . were you speaking to me , or sleeping with someone else ?
we were on a break !
why don &apos;t you just put that on your answering machine ?
it &apos;s valid , and i &apos;m not the only one who thinks so .
monica agrees with me .
what ?
i don &apos;t know .
you said it last night .
what i said was that i understood .
joey is the one who agreed with you .
really , joey ?
what ?
you know what ? there is no right or wrong here .
i think it &apos;s very obvious who &apos;s wrong here .
obviously not to joey .
what ?
joey and monica feel the way i do !
you and this innocent puppy act !
hey , guess who i am ?
look what you &apos;re doing to chandler !
look . we know that this is really , really hard for you guys .
you don &apos;t have to love each other .
you don &apos;t even have to like each other much right now .
but please , find a way to be around each other .
and not put us in the middle .
otherwise , i mean , that &apos;s just it for us hanging out together .
is that what you want ?
can you be civil ?
i can .
good , let &apos;s get back in the car . it &apos;s freezing ...
... and my chest is unsupported .
wait a second !
i mean , what are we doing ? who &apos;s going with who ?
look , you guys should go .
you know , you planned this all out ...
... and i don &apos;t wanna ruin it . so just go .
you drove all the way up here .
i &apos;ve got to take the car back anyway .
i &apos;m spending all day tomorrow with ben .
it &apos;s fine , okay ? just go . no guilt , i promise .
thank you .
we &apos;ll call you when we get back .
maybe we can , like , go to a movie or something .
or the rodeo !
that would be great .
i was being shelley winters from the poseidon adventure .
i know .
bye !
hi . sorry i &apos;m late .
were you sleeping ?
oh , great .
i had to get you a new battery . i got the best i could .
