tell me about the murder .
if i &apos;m wrong about tom ,
i don &apos;t think i can handle any of it without him .
i got a call . guess i &apos;m still on as your next of kin .
you &apos;re engaged ?
we broke up .
i saw you in the hospital ,
and i just haven &apos;t been able to stop thinking about you .
she &apos;s calling herself jolene parker .
she &apos;s either got lots of little targets
or one real big one .
i can &apos;t do this . i love my wife .
wrong answer .
elizabeth keen is not your wife . she &apos;s your target .
they miss home .
just a few more weeks .
go to bed . you look exhausted .
i got a stack of case files i need to get through .
i have waited a long time for this reunion , agent raimo .
we &apos;ve had the pleasure ?
yes . though it could hardly be called pleasurable .
i was captured by your task force --
collateral damage in your hunt for raymond reddington .
mako tanida .
on your knees .
i have no intention of getting --
you lack honor and humility , agent raimo .
i will provide you with both .
take up that tanto and remove it from its scabbard .
in feudal japan , one warrior &apos;s transgression against another
was measured by the code of bushido .
for your sins against me , i require ritual seppuku .
you will disembowel yourself to my satisfaction .
i will give you 60 seconds
to put that sword into your stomach and begin cutting .
do that , and it is you alone .
or i will run you through myself ...
and take your whole family .
you won &apos;t harm my family ?
if you abide by honor ...
i will not .

we just bumped into each other outside .
she &apos;s looking for a place in the neighborhood .
great .
i &apos;ve got to get out of my apartment . it &apos;s super @-@ cramped .
and my fiance nd i love this neighborhood , so --
ooh ! um , hey , what did you think of a @-@ allison &apos;s show ?
who ?
allison .
the exhibit at the willard street gallery .
you went to an art exhibit ?
well , uh , calling it art might be a stretch .
i @-@ it was amazing . why didn &apos;t you bring your wife ?
yeah , why didn &apos;t you bring your wife ?
for the record , i did invite you ,
but you were working ,
and trust me -- you didn &apos;t miss anything .
anyway , i would love to stay and talk art ,
but i should go grade some papers .
i should get going , as well .
let me give you my cell .
if you &apos;re looking for a realtor , my girlfriend ellie is awesome .
thank you , that &apos;s really cool of you .
good luck with your papers , tom .
thank you .
and i will see you at school .
thank you .
i see those wheels turning .
hey , brother .
to sam .
how you feeling ?
um , first 48 , right ?
yeah , that clock ran out .
hey , fellas .
pete . good to see you .
good to see you , too . got anything yet ?
they got nothing .
well , npa said suicide ,
said that sam was carrying a lot of debt .
ritual suicide ? i mean , come on .
i don &apos;t believe that for a second .
sammy loved sarah .
then who gutted him ?
the list of people we pissed off -- pick a number .
hey , strangers .
hey , audrey . how are you ? good to see you .
is retirement treating you well ?
yeah , well , never mind me .
it &apos;s a hell of a way to see you again . sorry .
hey , audrey . you speak to sarah ?
being back in the states is hard enough .
yeah . i think we &apos;re gonna try and stay here with sarah next week .
the house is gonna be surrounded by feds , sweetie .
i think she &apos;s gonna be okay .
good ol &apos; rez .
mr. emotional support .
we should probably get going
and let the family have some time alone .
bye , guys .
bye , audrey .
we &apos;ve been tracking one guy for five years .
my money -- reddington &apos;s got his fingerprints
all over this thing .
hey . can i ask you something ?
it &apos;s reddington . you know how to find him .
can you put the two of us in touch ?
what &apos;s going on with you two ?
why ?
because he &apos;s looking for you .
you shouldn &apos;t be here . i said i &apos;d send a messenger .
i wanted to deliver the check personally , christine .
thank you .
will it be ready in time ?
everything &apos;s on schedule , just like you asked --
just like last time .
what do they do for lunch ?
do they order in
or eat salads out of those tupperware bowls ?
how does it work with dancers ?
they smoke .
i &apos;ll see you on the 22nd .
and please send my thanks to your mother .
i found agent ressler .
i heard agent raimo was relieved of his viscera .
if you had anything to do with this --
agent ressler , please .
what was it -- payback for vienna ?
i &apos;m the one who reached out to you , donald .
and it wasn &apos;t to revisit all the times
i eluded your little coterie of door @-@ kickers
who pursued me with such fervor and zeal .
i came to discuss a former associate of mine
who your team arrested along the way -- mako tanida .
the yakuza boss ? he &apos;s in prison .
he was .
two days ago , he broke out of abashiri .
if you ask the japanese , they &apos;ll skirt it .
they claim abashiri is escape @-@ proof .
it &apos;s embarrassing .
they &apos;re touchy about that sort of thing .
i suspect tanida is the one who killed your agent friend .
so you want to help me find him ?
let me guess -- he double @-@ crossed you ,
and you want his head in a box .
there &apos;s a thought .
but for the moment , the scalp i &apos;m worried about is yours .
tanida is disciplined , relentless .
if he did kill agent raimo ,
there &apos;s the distinct possibility he &apos;s just getting started .
i fear , donald , that you &apos;re being hunted
by a vengeful , ruthless killer .
purpose of your visit ?
reunion with some old friends .
welcome to the united states , mr. itami .
hello , agent maguire .
who the hell are you ?
you don &apos;t remember me , do you ?
you will .
mako tanida , former clan boss of the azuma @-@ dojin
based out of osaka .
by the time our task force caught up ,
he controlled a large part of the heroin trade
traveling along the silk road .
after tanida &apos;s arrest ,
we thought his empire would collapse .
it didn &apos;t . in fact , it expanded --
grew to include alliances with the chinese triad ,
korean tong , even russian bratva .
and his operations in the u.s. have grown extensively .
for a time , the intelligence community
believed tanida somehow was operating his empire
from inside prison .
no one knew how ,
but there were theories he had politicians in his pocket
or he controlled the army ,
but after he was put into solitary , it became clear
that someone else was running the empire .
within the agency , that man is known as aiko tanida ,
mako &apos;s younger brother .
he escaped the night of the raid that took tanida .
we believe he went underground , dark ,
reemerged as something entirely different --
bookish boy turned ruthless crime lord .
they call him &quot; tensei . &quot; means &quot; reborn . &quot;
reach out to your agency contacts .
i want to know everything there is to know about this brother .
uh , we just received word .
uh , agent maguire ...
i &apos;m sorry .
maguire &apos;s body was found under a bridge
near boardway at 39th .
domain awareness has three
surveillance hits on tanida . units en route .
arrived on united 472 from tokyo .
passed through customs at 11 : 32 under the alias yasu itami .
feed npa the alias .
the reddington task force-- who else was on it ?
myself and bobby jonica .
i &apos;m sending protective detail .
did you hear me ?
agent ressler .
i got a place up in prince george &apos;s county ,
off the grid .
i got to get audrey there .
hey , what the hell is wrong with you ? you come to my house ?
calm down .
you &apos;re not my handler . i don &apos;t work for you .
berlin is having doubts .
yeah ? well , berlin doesn &apos;t have a damn clue .
do you have any idea how many candidates there were ?
they chose me .
i &apos;ve done everything they asked .
i married the woman , for god &apos;s sake .
i &apos;ve made her think my entire world revolves around her .
and now it &apos;s been two years , and i &apos;ve heard nothing .
we sent word four months ago .
four months ago , i had to go dark because
reddington sent a psychopath with a knife into my house .
he cut me like a totem pole , and because of that ,
liz finds my go @-@ bag , my passports--
everything .
so what did i do ? i got myself out .
i convinced her that the passports are fake ,
the cash isn &apos;t mine ,
so excuse me for being--
don &apos;t touch that !
i &apos;ve had my hands full .
berlin wants information .
so do i.
you know somebody put cameras in that house ?
somebody was watching us , and it wasn &apos;t the fbi ,
so why don &apos;t you tell me who the hell was it ?
i can &apos;t help you unless you calm down .
you leave the door open ?
yeah . i @-@ i told you i was gonna bring my stuff by .
i just didn &apos;t want to keep locking and unlocking the door .
were you downstairs ?
y @-@ yeah . i parked around back .
why ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;ll tell you in the car .
don , what &apos;s wrong ?
pete maguire is dead .
come on .
best i can tell , their paths have crossed at key moments
in the past 20 years-- quantico , baltimore .
she doesn &apos;t know , and i can &apos;t prove it ,
but i believe reddington was funneling money
through the adoptive father for years .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s the black site . from memory .
it &apos;s the unit keen works for .
what about the cases ?
you know , i sat right next to reddington once--
at a hospital .
i could have put a bullet in his head .
that wasn &apos;t your mission .
all right , show and tell &apos;s over . i have detention at 4 : 00 .
where are we going ?
what kind of trouble are you in ?
sam didn &apos;t commit suicide . he was murdered .
what are you ...
the same person who killed pete .
you remember japan , how the task force
spent time there looking for reddington ?
well , we put someone away , and now they &apos;re out .
and they &apos;re coming for you .
i &apos;m gonna take you somewhere safe .
my folks got this cabin up in p.g. county .
i &apos;m gonna handle this . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
don , i &apos;m scared .
hang on ! hang on !
don ?
we have to go !
audrey !
no , no , no , no .
stop sniffle ...
i got you . i &apos;ve got you , sweetie . here . let me see .
okay , come on . come on , come on , come on . come on , come on .
put your hand here . put your hand here .
come on , girl . come on , come on , come on , come on .
come on . no , no , no , no .
look at me .
stay , stay -- stay with me . stay with me .
don &apos;t go .
come on , audrey . s--
come on , audrey .
you can &apos;t sideline me .
we &apos;ll find tanida .
doesn &apos;t matter how long it takes .
but we have to do it the right way -- follow procedure .
you really expect me to care about procedure ?
of course not .
i can &apos;t imagine what you &apos;re going through .
i wouldn &apos;t dare .
but don &apos;t compromise yourself .
you &apos;re a good agent ...
a good man .
i have to do something .
you &apos;ll grieve .
and while you do , we &apos;ll track tanida down ,
and we &apos;ll make sure he gets his due .
you have my word on that .
i &apos;ll have a car take you home .
bobby , where are you ?
i went through every c.i. , every source i had
when i was running that task force .
i got nothing .
what about tensei , the brother ?
i reached out to a friend of mine at the d.e.a.
he &apos;s got no base of operation ,
no regular haunts , no hot spots .
this guy &apos;s a ghost .
look , don -- don , we don &apos;t --
we can -- we can do this later .
no , we do it now .
somebody out there knows something .
well , i &apos;ll tell you who knows .
reddington ?
they worked together , donny .
reddington understands how this world works .
what i wouldn &apos;t give to get him alone in a room
for just five minutes .
she still in town ?
no .
she &apos;s at the corn palace in mitchell , south dakota .
bring her to me .
i thought you wanted to see how this played out .
it has .
well , you want me to bring her in , there &apos;s gonna be a fee ,
and it &apos;s gonna cost you double .
oh ? why is that ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t like you .
and that hat makes your head look funny .
the pot meets the kettle at last .
bring me the girl .
searching in the desert for a drop of vengeance
to slake an unquenchable thirst
is a lonely walk , my friend .
tanida &apos;s close .
i can burn the whole neighborhood down ,
or you can tell me where he is .
donald , i understand how you feel .
beneath the iron @-@ and @-@ rust exterior
beats the heart of a man swimming in immeasurable grief .
i am truly sorry about audrey .
there are few that understand love and loss more than i.
well , i &apos;m glad you understand .
where is he ?
let me tell you something
that someone much wiser than i
told me at a similar point in my life .
go home .
turn back from this and go home .
it may seem like the hardest thing in the world ,
but it is profoundly easier than what you &apos;re contemplating .
i &apos;m not turning back .
that &apos;s pretty much what i said .
in your dust @-@ up with tanida , were there any survivors ?
yes .
injuries ?
yeah . why ?
there &apos;s a house in columbia heights --
doubles as an underground hospital .
1306 gerard .
may be worth a visit .
agent ressler .
once you cross over , there are things in the darkness
that can keep your heart from ever feeling the light again .
all i feel is hate .
good .
you &apos;re gonna need it .
are you sure about this ? a hospital ?
where the hell did you get your information ?
you coming or not ?
rez , you got to tell me what the hell you &apos;re thinking here .
i &apos;m gonna find tanida .
i &apos;m gonna find anyone who was involved .
find them ...
and i &apos;m gonna kill them all .
ah , okay .
f.b.i. ! everybody on the ground !
you ! show me your hands ! show me your hands !
get over there ! go !
you remember me ? &apos; cause i haven &apos;t forgotten you .
let &apos;s make this quick . where &apos;s tanida ?
where is he ? !
shh . where &apos;s tanida ?
no , no , no , no , no ! english !
22nd vermont . blue door .
it &apos;s a club .
please -- you didn &apos;t hear it from me .
come on .
stay there !
no .
yep .
we need to move -- now .
metro p.d. got called in on an 808 .
they were told two men presented as fbi .
ressler and jonica .
any idea how they slipped their protective detail ?
he &apos;s not answering his cell .
how did they know to come here ?
mpd , with full resources of the fbi --
we didn &apos;t even know this place existed .
you and i both know how they got here .
no , i understand , but i don &apos;t care about the prince .
no , no , no , no , no . the 22nd . that was our agreement .
christine , i don &apos;t care about production issues .
please -- just figure it out by the 22nd .
ressler -- where is he ?
i know he came to you . i know you told him about that hospital .
agent ressler came to me for assistance , which i provided .
you sent him after tanida .
no .
i provided a bit of direction in an otherwise blind pursuit .
he &apos;s not like you .
he can &apos;t just murder someone in cold blood
and come out of it okay on the other end .
nobody can murder someone in cold blood
and come out okay on the other end .
we need your help .
we have to find tanida before ressler does .
we &apos;ve looked through his financials ,
his prison contacts , the brother who --
tensei ?
the reborn .
he &apos;s dead .
what do you mean , he &apos;s dead ?
aiko tanida is running his brother &apos;s empire .
aiko tanida died
the day his brother was captured by ressler &apos;s task force .
anyone who tells you otherwise doesn &apos;t know the difference
between a water buffalo and a musk ox .
mako tanida !
agent donald ressler .
let &apos;s go for a drive .
reddington says aiko tanida &apos;s dead .
died the same night his brother
was apprehended by ressler &apos;s task force .
no , we have documented proof he escaped , evidence from --
then it was falsified .
we need to review what happened that night .
think about it -- no one &apos;s seen or heard
from the guy in four years .
our last known photograph is older than that .
aiko tanida &apos;s not hiding . he &apos;s dead .
we need to review the case files .
someone else is running tanida &apos;s business .
this is the incident report from the npa in japan .
what am i looking for ?
most of the details support our own investigation .
the vehicle carrying aiko tanida was ambushed .
only the driver &apos;s body was found .
&quot; most of the details &quot; ? what did we miss ?
well , there was somebody else in the car .
the npa report makes a reference to an american federal agent
accompanying the transport vehicle .
what federal agent ?
bobby jonica .
jonica was on the task force .
he had intimate knowledge of tanida &apos;s enterprise .
he knew everything -- key players , trade routes ,
distribution hookups .
and he was able to avoid detection
by making us believe aiko tanida was still alive .
jonica is tensei .
who contracted you ?
this isn &apos;t right .
who ?
was it younes ?
salumbides ?
we shouldn &apos;t have brought him here .
was it reddington ?
somebody might have seen you .
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
i should &apos;ve let him grab you
and drag you off to god knows where .
i can handle myself just fine .
you weren &apos;t .
but you &apos;re welcome .
he &apos;s not gonna talk .
it was reddington .
you don &apos;t know that .
you don &apos;t know that !
do you know that this whole thing is because of you
that we &apos;re here with him ?
you never should have come to my house in the first place ...
i was following orders ...
and you never should have talked to my wife .
what are we gonna do about him ?
you really don &apos;t get it , do you -- what he &apos;s doing ?
wu jing . the alchemist .
what are you talking about ?
the cases -- reddington used them to track you down ,
to get to you , to me .
that means that you are compromised ,
and if you &apos;re compromised ,
then it &apos;s only a matter of time before your trail leads to me .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
call my wife .
get her on the phone . disengage .
disengage ?
disengage .
tell her that you &apos;re not looking for a place anymore ,
that your boyfriend got a job offer ,
and you &apos;re moving to dayton .
don &apos;t do it .
as soon as you hang up that phone , he &apos;s gonna kill you ,
then he &apos;s gonna kill me .
don &apos;t make that call .
says the man tied to a chair .
do it .
hi , liz . it &apos;s jolene .
um ... i @-@ i hope you haven &apos;t gotten in touch
with your realtor friend yet .
the craziest thing just happened .
uh , my fiance got a job in dayton , of all places .
so , um , major bummer .
uh , say goodbye to tom for me , okay ?
there . happy now ?
okay .
now you .
you okay ?
hey , donny , we &apos;re doing the right thing here .
how long did it take for your girlfriend to bleed out ?
you must be filled with rage .
you have no idea .
maybe i do .
hey , just keep it to yourself back there , huh ?
do you remember the night we met ,
the arrest , taking away me and my brother ?
that was the last i saw of him ,
the last anyone saw of him .
that &apos;s a very sad story .
don &apos;t listen to him , donny .
hey , shut up back there .
raimo and maguire ...
... i am satisfied they knew nothing .
that leaves the two of you .
you think i did all this because you arrested me ?
i said shut up back there !
you were doing your job . i respected that .
what i do not respect is that you killed my brother ...
just shut your mouth !
... took my business .
bobby , what is he talking
not one more word out of you !
bobby , talk to me . talk to me .
never mind him , don .
don &apos;t listen to him .
he &apos;s gonna kill both of us !
shut up !
donny , let go !
don &apos;t move , brother .
don &apos;t even breathe .
he picked up tanida . after that , nothing .
we found his cell in his apartment .
the gps in his car has been deactivated .
he &apos;s off the grid .
prince george &apos;s county .
ressler has a place there .
it &apos;s where he was going with audrey .
if he wants to be alone --
get there -- now .
what are you doing , donny ?
come on .
doesn &apos;t have to be like this .
you got to understand me , donny .
i &apos;m chasing scumbags all around the world ,
making millions of dollars .
come on , donny .
this is me .
what are you telling me --
the boy scout &apos;s gonna kill his best friend ?
&quot; best friend . &quot;
couple months back , i was in this hospital .
i &apos;d been shot .
sitting in there for days ,
all alone .
and audrey just ...
pops into my head .
couldn &apos;t have been more than an hour later ,
she walks in .
it &apos;s like the universe tilted and brought her to me ,
like it was fated to happen .
but ...
it wasn &apos;t fate .
you know why ?
reddington .
i can tell you this because you &apos;re gonna die .
i work with reddington .
believe it or not , i was shot protecting him .
that &apos;s why i was in that hospital .
it &apos;s because of reddington
that audrey came back into my life .
he &apos;s why i got three more months with her .
and because of you ...
... she &apos;s gone .
my greatest enemy brought her back to me ,
and my best friend took her away !
no , no . donny , you &apos;re wrong .
i didn &apos;t kill audrey . tanida did .
don &apos;t !
no , you brought this down on us --
on pete and on sam .
you &apos;re gonna do the honorable thing .
or i &apos;ll kill you myself .
call an ambulance .
set a perimeter .
pick it up .
that &apos;ll be crazy . i &apos;m not gonna do this .
what -- are you crazy ?
pick it up !
i &apos;m not gonna do it , donny !
you &apos;re gonna have to shoot me first !
come on ! what are you , crazy ? !
pick up the damn knife .
no .
ressler , no !
they &apos;re all dead , liz .
audrey &apos;s gone .
this isn &apos;t the way .
what if he killed tom ?
what would you do ?
listen to me --
if you do this ,
you &apos;re gonna go to jail for the rest of your life .
do it , donny .
do it .
go ahead , donny .
donny , pull the trigger .
don &apos;t listen to him .
you know what they &apos;ll do to me in prison , donny .
a dirty cop -- i can &apos;t do that , donny . come on .
pick it up .
come on .
put down the gun , ressler !
pull the trigger .
pick it up ! pick it up .
do it !
pull the trigger , donny .
don &apos;t listen to him .
she &apos;s dead because of me , donny ! do it !
pull the trigger !
pick it up !
pick it up .
donny , come on .
donny ...
i &apos;m sorry , donny .
donny ...
he &apos;s one of our biggest donors .
never comes to any other performance .
same show on the same day every year .
they say his daughter was in the show years ago .
ladies , you &apos;re paid to dance ,
not to gossip .
the cowboy -- have you found him ?
no .
the girl ?
nothing .
both of them --
they &apos;re gone .
mind if i join you ?
not at all .
how was your day ?
let &apos;s talk about anything but that .
like that girl jolene .
what about her ?
did , uh , did ellie find her a place ?
i guess it &apos;s not happening .
she called me and left a message --
said her fiance got a job in dayton .
so , what -- she &apos;s just ...
gone ?
i guess so .
i &apos;m kind of glad .
i saw the way she looked at you .
come here .
kiss me , &quot; tim , &quot;
or whatever your name is .
&quot; donald , i want you to know
that i do understand how you feel . &quot;
from mr. reddington .
&quot; there is nothing that can take the pain away .
but eventually , you will find a way to ...
live with it . &quot;
&quot; there will be nightmares .
and every day , when you wake up ,
it will be the first thing you think about . &quot;
&quot; until one day ...
it will be the second thing . &quot;
