ray ...
it &apos;s conforming .
it &apos;s not conforming .
it &apos;s saying you own me .
that &apos;s an old @-@ fashioned way of looking at things .
i don &apos;t want to be a possession .
marriage is about ... love and commitment ,
not possession , baby .
don &apos;t you want kids , sunday dinners ?
i like sunday dinners .
tying the knot would guarantee me front @-@ row seats
to the movie of your life .
don &apos;t you want someone to ...
change your diapers when you get old ?
baby , if i ever need diapers ,
you just take me right out back and shoot me .
don &apos;t do it , son .
what are you saying ?
marriage .
ruin your life .
why don &apos;t you ring these up .
you get married , the romance fizzles ,
your girl gets fat .
next thing you know you &apos;re lying on the couch
wondering how come you don &apos;t have a bed .
marriage is overrated .
marriage is overrated .
how &apos;s it going , stranger ?
oh , i &apos;m a little tired . i went salsa dancing last night .
oh , my god , like i need another reason to find you amazing .
this call for you from sean mcallister ,
came to my phone accidentally .
he sounded very hot and very important .
did he leave a message ?
no . but it &apos;s from paris .
a scottish guy calling from paris .
know this , emily-- even if he is ugly ,
scottish guys are hot . it &apos;s the accent .
i &apos;ll keep that in mind .
so what &apos;s the skinny ? is he an ex ?
international booty call ?
no . he &apos;s a friend .
where &apos;s seaver ?
she had to take a test at the academy .
i know we &apos;ve all seen the news .
mass murder in miles city , montana .
6 people shot and killed at a gas station .
robbery ?
no apparent motive .
any security footage ?
no . no cameras , no witnesses ,
ballistics say we &apos;re looking at two shooters .
well , something at the station must have triggered them .
it doesn &apos;t look like they had much of a plan .
and it may happen again .
spree killers often repeat themselves .
we did it , baby .
we did it .
that was awesome .
i love you , ray .
love you , too , syd .

&quot; what really raises one &apos;s indignation against suffering
is not suffering intrinsically ,
but the senselessness of suffering . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry to reroute you to billings ,
but last night , this went down .
have you released a statement to the press ?
no , but it &apos;s already hit the air .
where &apos;s the car they dumped ?
it &apos;s over there . agents are searching it now .
one of the vics said the shooters were a male and a female .
how many people were murdered here ?
8 . if you add the miles city killings , we &apos;re up to 14 .
male @-@ female teams are usually committed to pleasing each other ,
both mentally and physically .
these guys are thrill killers .
they &apos;re aroused by the adrenaline rush .
so they &apos;re not gonna stop until we catch them .
so this is just foreplay .
what &apos;s the news saying about us now ?
they know we &apos;re male and female .
how did they figure that out ?
i don &apos;t know .
there was nothing girly about the way we killed those people .
where do you want to live , ray ?
i told you--aruba . right on the ocean .
i like the ocean .
so how do you want to spend the rest of our honeymoon ?
exactly the same way that we spent the last 12 months .
till death do us part .
nothing &apos;s gonna happen to us , syd .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen dead bodies before , but this is insane .
they &apos;re like bonnie and clyde .
they smashed one guy &apos;s vertebrae so bad ,
it looked like a derailed train .
extreme brutality to this degree
is what &apos;s known as an obliteration attack .
the unsub wants to completely erase these victims from existence .
both of the vics were shot at point blank range .
what made those ?
that was a crowbar .
whew ! baby !
ray , i &apos;m hungry .
the unsubs are becoming more and more confident ,
which means their weapons are becoming more and more personal .
the excitement of the brutality
allows them to overcome their human inhibitions .
why is this one covered ?
it &apos;s the store clerk . guy got it pretty bad .
in medieval times , it would just be another monday .
he was sodomized with a tire iron .
that kind of overkill suggests
he was the root of their aggression .
maybe they &apos;re zeroing in on what &apos;s really pissing them off .
they took the store owner in the back .
they got the schoolteacher over here .
the kid over here thought he was safe .
why chain them in ?
they thrive on sadistic power .
there &apos;s rice all over the floor .
bullet probably hit a box .
i take it this is the food aisle .
i don &apos;t see rice for sale anywhere on these shelves .
who comes to a gas station throwing rice ?
ok , i checked surrounding areas .
72 people applied for marriage licenses
in montana in the last 3 days .
any of them have records ?
31 do , the rest are clean .
all right . send over all the
names of the suspects with their ages , garcia .
lover , they &apos;re all ready sent . check your phones .
so you think they &apos;re newlyweds ?
well , there was rice all over the crime scene ,
and a bunch of alcohol was missing from the store .
so they &apos;re on their honeymoon .
what did you find out from the m.e. ?
overkill on the store clerk and sodomy--object penetration .
garcia , last 30 days , check any store clerks killed
in the states east of montana .
wow . uh , there was a savagely beaten store clerk
outside jamestown at the beginning of the month ,
and then another one 2 days later in bowman , north dakota .
and that &apos;s probably where they started .
thanks , garcia .
hey , there .
are you drinking all alone tonight , honey ?
my company &apos;s a little busy .
my name &apos;s ray .
hi , ray . hi , ray .
i just got married .
and i &apos;m an alcoholic .
congratulations . congratulations .
i &apos;m just passing through town
and i wanted to stop and share
because i partied last night .
what do you think made you drink ?
come on . i was celebrating with my lady .
that &apos;s a big rock you got on your finger there .
i like things big .
i bet you do .
well , i &apos;ve been drinking my whole life .
i started when i was 8 .
my father was an alcoholic .
it tastes like ...
grape kool @-@ aid .
oh , i like kool @-@ aid .
whiskey and bourbon ...
were his choice .
after he got his glass , he &apos;s come and he &apos;d tuck me in .
first , he &apos;d ask me about my day .
then he &apos;d , uh , he &apos;d move his hands up my leg .
told me everything was gonna be ok .
it was never ok .
20 bucks ...
i &apos;ll let you have a taste .
oh , you got a deal .
i &apos;d just bury my head into my pillow and wait until it was over .
and when he was done ,
i &apos;d just lie there quietly .
it &apos;s nice of you to share with us , ray .
what step have you gotten to ?
7 .
the same age i was when he did that to me .
well , it &apos;s time for you to do 8 and 9 .
have you admitted your shortcomings ?
this wasn &apos;t my fault .
but you &apos;ve let this one incident
dictate your whole life .
i was a kid .
i know , ray .
but until you let this go ,
you will always be a victim to the bottle .
to the bottle , to the bottle , to the bottle ...
screw you and your bottle .
what happened to him ?
he got fresh with me .
this is 100 miles west of the last gas station .
we anticipated them hitting this area , but not here .
maybe this guy tried to have sex with one of our unsubs
while the other one was inside .
cheating on your honeymoon .
someone &apos;s got a twisted sense of commitment .
so they steal the liquor from the gas station ,
they go on a binge , and then they come to a meeting ?
what if the unsubs met at a meeting ?
they hear each other &apos;s stories
and develop a bond because of their similar backgrounds .
that makes sense . people typically drink to excess
because they &apos;re unhappy with themselves or their past .
from the looks of it ,
at least one of the unsubs shot from up front .
run !
well , if the meeting started at 8 : 00,
and this happened at 8 : 45,
they were probably in the sharing portion of the meeting .
so maybe they didn &apos;t come in here to kill .
you know , what if they really are struggling with sobriety ?
if they &apos;re really working the program ,
they could be working on the hardest steps .
which are ?
7 , 8 , and 9 .
acknowledge your shortcomings ,
accept responsibility , and make amends .
the trouble is , these unsubs already broke
one of the most important steps .
what &apos;s that ?
the thirteenth step .
members aren &apos;t supposed to enter relationships with each other
while trying to get sober .
what are you thinking about ?
we need to go to the next step .
all this killing and drinking is fun ,
but it doesn &apos;t change the fact that , you know ,
my father used to rape me ,
or what your daddy did to you , you know .
what are you saying , syd ?
if you want to find closure ,
you gotta go directly to the source .
we do 8 and 9 ?
why not ?
we &apos;re looking for a young couple from north dakota ,
late teens to late 20s .
we believe they may have recently been married .
we &apos;re seeing that alcohol
plays a significant role in these crimes .
it &apos;s allowing them to kill freely and recklessly .
our unsubs are killing surrogates
who represent those responsible for deep @-@ seated wounds .
now , these two most likely met at alcohol support .
and they get a sexual charge out of the kill .
the change from gas station to alcohol support meetings
suggests one of them might have a slight moral compass
that led them to get help .
ultimately , we believe one of the pair
is a sociopath , while the other is a psychopath .
what &apos;s really the difference ?
they &apos;re similar pathologies , but a sociopath
is less likely to participate in criminal activity
and can be lured by a dominant ,
while a psychopath is a consummate leader
and likely to engage and destroy anyone in their way .
the most recent attack was 12 hours ago ,
which means they &apos;re most likely heading west of helena
and towards idaho . all surrounding areas should be on alert .
this is it ?
this is it .
this is it . this is your house .
say hi to me , baby .
hi , baby .
you look good .
this is ray &apos;s house .
hey , baby . kiss me .
you look good , baby .
cute butt .
yeah , can help you ?
raymond .
say cheese .
hi , daddy .
ray . ray .
these alcohol support groups are based on anonymity .
there &apos;ll be no record of who attended the meeting .
garcia , our unsubs attended an alcohol support meeting
last night , but they &apos;re not from the area .
can you trace who accessed their website yesterday ?
3 people went to that website ,
one on a mobile , 2 on dsl .
cross @-@ check that with a list of anyone married in montana
in the last 2 days .
no , no , i &apos;m coming up empty .
see if anyone on the list who accessed the site
is from north dakota .
bingo , baby . ray donovan of devil &apos;s lake .
ironic .
what &apos;s his story ?
he is 27 . he &apos;s been in and out of foster care
since he was 10 .
he looks like kind of a lush
and a bit of a meany .
he &apos;s had 2 duis in the last 2 years .
he was slapped with a restraining order
by an ex @-@ girlfriend .
sounds like our boy .
what &apos;s her name ? she might be his partner .
no , she &apos;s not . her name &apos;s amy wichowsky .
she died a year ago
of an overdose from a mix of alcohol and heroin .
garcia , get us the address of the foster home .
somebody there might know something .
sure . give me a sec .
i talked to all 4 of ray &apos;s foster families .
they say he was removed from his parents &apos; home
because of drugs and abuse .
garcia .
yes ?
can we confirm that with the biological family ?
ok . i &apos;m gonna patch you through .
i want you to take the ninth step .
take the ninth step ? why ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
i was put into foster care because of you ,
you bastard .
you were put in foster care because of our drug problem .
ray , no one molested you .
put the gun down , ray .
shut up !
take the ninth step or i &apos;m gonna shoot you , dad .
i didn &apos;t do it .
i didn &apos;t touch you .
ray , you &apos;re my own flesh and blood .
i never touched you .
don &apos;t you lie !
i said i &apos;ll take care of it .
i swear it .
take the ninth step .
i ain &apos;t taking no step .
take it .
take it .
i ain &apos;t gonna ask you again .
no !
why did you do that , syd ?
&apos;cause you wouldn &apos;t .
i would have . look what you did .
come on , ray .
look what you did , syd !
come on , ray .
look what you did !
it wasn &apos;t for you to do !
this was mine , syd !
all right , so ray must have been sitting right here ,
playing russian roulette with his dad .
mr. donovan was shot from across the room .
ray couldn &apos;t have done it sitting there .
maybe he got mad ,
went over by the door , shot him from there .
我们得谈谈
prentiss .
you all right ?
yeah . it &apos;s nothing .
uh , what if ray didn &apos;t do it at all ?
what if the girl pulled the trigger ?
well , why would ray let her do that ?
he was the one with the grudge .
ray kept asking paul to take the ninth step .
&quot; take the ninth step . &quot;
it sounds like they &apos;re making amends ,
but they &apos;re twisting it ,
trying to force people who have wronged them
to make amends to them .
mrs. donovan , did you hear the name of the girl
that ray &apos;s with ?
he kept calling her syd .
syd , i think .
maybe she &apos;s the one calling the shots .
she &apos;s the psychopath .
well , if she did do it without his consent ,
they &apos;re going to be at odds .
the first marital fight is supposed to be the worst .
well , it just might be the wedge that we need .
ray ...
please don &apos;t be mad .
baby . baby !
i need a minute .
let me talk to you . i &apos;m going to tell you i &apos;m sorry .
he touched me , not you .
baby , just take it out on me .
come on . just take your frustrations out on me . come on .
come on , baby . hit me . hit me .
stop it , syd !
hit me .
stop it , syd !
yeah . yeah .
do it . do it .
when i say i &apos;m gonna handle something , i will handle it .
i understand , baby .
i am the man in this relationship .
i just want to make you feel better , baby .
syd , a man takes care of things .
you understand me ? huh ?
i understand . i understa .
i understand .
i &apos;m serious , syd .
i am , too . mmm .
ok , so , no ray donovan filed for a marriage certificate .
however , i looked at that list again ,
and there &apos;s a sydney manning of washington state
who filed for a marriage certificate 2 days ago in montana .
washington state ? we profiled north dakota .
yes , she &apos;s lived in north dakota for the last 4 years ,
and it gets better , or worse , rather . it turns out
that sydney was sentenced to mandatory rehab
after serving time for a hit and run
during which she was under the influence of alcohol and heroin .
oh , so she didn &apos;t volunteer for alcohol support .
no , she was placed there as part of her parole .
alcohol and heroin .
isn &apos;t that the same combo that ray &apos;s ex o.d.ed on ?
yes , it is , my friend .
so both syd and the ex have the same vice .
garcia , check to see if there &apos;s
any juvie records of the ex we can access .
amy was pulled out of high school
so she could go to rehab for alcohol dependency .
but no mention of the heroin ?
what are you thinking ?
psychopaths will destroy anything in their path .
what if amy was in sydney &apos;s way ?
garcia , where is sydney manning &apos;s biological family ?
spokane , washington .
and why was she pulled out of her home ?
her father was molesting her .
so ray and syd did meet
after sharing similar backgrounds in alcohol support .
and if they &apos;re sticking to the pattern of making amends ,
sydney &apos;s father &apos;s next on the list .
reid , you stay at the command center in case they double back .
the rest of us are gonna go to spokane .
* i want to take you back there *
* can i take you back ? *
* are you ready ? *
* smoke @-@ filled rooms with an amber glow *
* whispers in your ear ... *
this is about to get crazy .
* ... movin &apos; slow *
* shadows dance all across the wall *
* reflections are the revival *
can i help you ?
* you can &apos;t stop when the music &apos;s on your mind *
* feel so alive *
hey , daddy .
how you been ?
what are you doing here , sydney ?
have you heard of the ninth step ?
* are you ready *
what ?
i got no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
making amends .
why don &apos;t you just put the gun away .
see , i don &apos;t want to put the gun away .
i want you ...
to touch me .
what are you talking about ?
i want you to touch me .
you used to like it .
syd , put your skirt down .
i ain &apos;t puttin &apos; down jack .
sydney--
what &apos;s the matter , daddy ?
you don &apos;t like the way i look ?
sydney ...
you &apos;re out of control .
no , no ...
you were out of control .
listen ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry i hurt you .
i &apos;ve changed .
i &apos;ve found god .
god ?
where was he every time you &apos;d take me to that back room , huh ?
i don &apos;t know .
not here .
i don &apos;t know .
not here .
every time i &apos;d hear that door chime ,
somebody &apos;s gonna come save me ?
it never happened .
god was nowhere near this place .
please .
sydney ...
what do you want me to do ?
there &apos;s nothing you can do ,
you sorry piece of crap !
yeah , baby .
daddy ? daddy !
what are you doing to my dad ?
may i help you ?
mrs. manning , we &apos;re with the fbi .
is your husband home ?
he &apos;s at work . what is this about ?
your daughter sydney-- we think she &apos;s planning on hurting him .
sydney ? that &apos;s gary &apos;s kid .
he hasn &apos;t seen her in years .
can you tell us your husband &apos;s work address , please ?
uh , 785 halbrook street , off kirkland road .
he owns a gas station .
thank you .
please , sydney , don &apos;t do this .
daddy !
i never hurt her . i never hurt her !
of course you did it !
he didn &apos;t , i swear . daddy !
hey . hey . daddies don &apos;t do this to their daughters .
hey , it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
we &apos;re gonna get you out of here .

there &apos;s no alcohol in here .

my dad doesn &apos;t drink . he says it &apos;s against the bible .
you don &apos;t have to protect him anymore . he &apos;s gone .
get her a water .
get her some water !
what do you want ?
mr. donovan , how you doing in there ?
how do you think i &apos;m doing ? you shot my girl .
no , it was one of my agents . he didn &apos;t have a choice .
he had a choice . he could &apos;ve shot me . now put him on the phone .
i can &apos;t do that .
yes , you can . put him on the phone .
he needs to fix this crap .
morgan .
hello , ray .
you know , if you come out ,
we can get sydney to the hospital .
she doesn &apos;t need a hospital .
she &apos;s strong .
don &apos;t be stupid .
you don &apos;t be stupid .
now get your men out of here so we can continue on as planned .
we can &apos;t do that , ray , and you know it .
you got a little girl inside .
and god only knows what happened to sydney &apos;s father .
justice happened to her father .
so he &apos;s dead ?
damn right he &apos;s dead , and his kid &apos;s gonna be , too ,
if you don &apos;t get me a car to take us to aruba .
all right . let me see what i can do about that .
is there anything else you need in the meantime ?
some gauze and some booze .
and none of them cheap kind , either .
it has now been 2 hours since ray donovan and sydney manning
locked themselves inside this spokane gas station .
two hostages are thought to be inside ,
the owner of the station and his 10 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
what do they want ?
liquor and tickets to aruba .
they &apos;re delusional .
you &apos;re not negotiating with them ?
no , but we &apos;re gonna let them think we are .
does she look like me ?
i think she does .
i don &apos;t know , syd .
don &apos;t be scared . we &apos;re not gonna hurt you .
syd ...
what grade are you in ?
shh , syd .
you need to preserve your energy .
fourth grade .
i liked the fourth grade .
stop talking to her .
relax , ray ,
we &apos;re having a family reunion in aisle 3 .
be supportive .
move back !
move back or i kill this girl .
back off ! back off !
i will shoot this kid !
back off !
back !
kid , unlock that door . you got it ?
put your hand on the lock .
just unlock it .
got it ?
ok . yes .
ray ? take it easy , man .
take it easy .
you take it easy .
put it down !
all right .
put it down .
we got you the stuff you asked for .
we &apos;re working on the rest .
great .
if you need anything else , you just pick up that phone .
it &apos;s routed straight to us . you understand ?
i should kill you right now .
back up .
i &apos;m leaving .
back up !
now , lock the door . you got it ?
let &apos;s go .
lock it .
stay here . don &apos;t move .
don &apos;t move .
ok .
did they say anything about the car ?
shh , baby .
poor baby . let me see .
yeah ?
where the hell is our car ?
i need you to listen to me for a second .
i know you &apos;ve had a hard time ,
with your father and everything that he did to you .
shut up . you don &apos;t know anything about me .
last year , your ex @-@ girlfriend amy was murdered .
i know that .
amy committed suicide .
no , she was killed , ray .
nah . amy o.d.ed on pcp and alcohol .
they found heroin in her system , ray .
amy never did heroin .
exactly . because somebody gave it to her .
why don &apos;t you ask sydney about it ?
why ? what does she-- what does she have to do with this ?
ray , what &apos;s going on ?
come on , man , think for a second .
sydney joined alcohol support right after you and amy broke up .
she could see you still had feelings for amy ,
so sydney needed amy out of the way .
you &apos;re out of line , pal .
then ask her . but i guarantee when you do ,
she &apos;s not gonna answer you .
she &apos;s only gonna question you back , ray .
what are you talking about ?
sydney is the one who gave amy that heroin .
ask her .
hey , what-- what &apos;s wrong , ray ?
ask her . get her to come clean .
did you give amy heroin ?
baby , what are you talking about ? i love you .
listen--
there , you see that , ray ?
we call that structural deception .
she doesn &apos;t want to answer your question .
she &apos;s only buying herself some time ,
so she can think of something else to say to you .
that &apos;s not true .
ray , sydney killed amy .
and if you press her ,
she &apos;s probably gonna try and use sexual distraction
to get you to change the subject .
don &apos;t you talk about my wife like that .
what is-- what is he saying ?
sexual distraction , ray .
you gotta listen to me .
no , i &apos;m done listening to you .
now , why don &apos;t you get us a car and some plane tickets ,
or i am gonna blow this girl &apos;s head off .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok , sis .
it &apos;s ok . baby ,
ray ...
why is he telling me that ?
why is he saying this to me ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know .
you wouldn &apos;t do that to amy , would you ?
of course not , baby .
hey , you know what we should do
while we &apos;re waiting to get out of here ?
we should make love right here in front of them .
yeah , that would really freak them out , wouldn &apos;t it ?
yeah ?
baby . make love to me .
right here in front of them . yeah .
i think we got through to him .
this thing &apos;s gonna end .
he &apos;s gonna ask her again .
he has to .
the kid &apos;s our only priority .
go back by the door .
i said go to the door !
baby , we can do it ,
while everybody &apos;s watching us .
all right .
ray , that &apos;s so hot . it &apos;s so hot , ray .
you know , the first time i saw you ,
i knew i had to have you .
you were the yin to my yang , ray .
till death do us part , right ?
yeah .
yeah , right .
till death do us part .
oh , baby .
syd .
syd .
what &apos;s happening in there ?
ray &apos;s pacing .
that is not good .
what did you do to her ?
syd ? syd ! please , syd .
wake up , syd .
baby , wake up . come on .
syd , please wake up .
please .
please .
please , syd .
enough &apos;s enough , baby .
i see the girl .
where &apos;s sydney and ray ?
morgan , go .
no !
syd !
