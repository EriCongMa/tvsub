frankie , where are you ?
welcome to the chop shop , cugine .
you can &apos;t kill me twice , sally boy .
i &apos;m already fucking dead , remember ?
i &apos;m the boss , michael . what you had belongs to me .
even the girl i loved ?
what &apos;s mine is mine . what &apos;s yours is mine .
well ,
this is mine too , sally .
now you can have it .
fuck .
fuck ben kingsley .
danny baldwin took him to fucking acting school .
very well directed , morgan .
i think there &apos;s potentially more money in this than in the porn .
so what do we think ? we need the extra scene ?
i like it the way it is .
i don &apos;t know , chrissy , these audiences today love blood .
i tend to agree with carlo .
i &apos;m thinking one more sexy kill .
when michael follows centrella to the strip club ,
what if he chops up one of the women ?
who , as fate would have it ,
was at one time sally boy &apos;s mistress .
two extra shoot days , at a minimum .
if it buys us a theatrical release ...
i &apos;m gonna have to get more money from tony .
i want this fucking thing out there .
yeah , t , what &apos;s up ?
you talked to the air mattress guy ?
i &apos;m in editing . we just saw the cut of cleaver .
and ?
awesome as is .
the lawyer called . we might have to change the title .
the eldridge cleaver estate want an injunction .
if you wanna see some of it , we &apos;re finishing the adr after lunch .
what &apos;s that again ?
sound dubbing .
call this dispatcher . it &apos;s a holiday weekend .
thousands of people will be at the beach .
i &apos;m on it .
he coming down ?
please .
he don &apos;t give two shits about production .
it &apos;s a little boring , i gotta say .
i mean , that was surprising to me .
mr sacrimoni , how are you today ?
isn &apos;t that for you to tell me ?
i wish i had better news .
based on the latest pictures ,
the cancer has continued to metastasise from the lungs .
we show masses in the mediastinal lymph nodes ,
both kidneys and the brain .
the headaches .
so
the lobectomy , radiation ,
the goddamn chemo ,
what was all that ? for kicks ?
those were our options at the time .
now what are our options ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend any .
we &apos;re looking at stage four small cell carcinoma of the lungs .
there &apos;s no stage five .
that &apos;s correct .
how long ?
difficult to say .
i have seen miracles over the years .
forget the miracles .
three months .
give or take .
thank you for your candour .
we have a plane back to springfield .
how you doing , john ?
it &apos;s funny . ironic . whichever .
i got here .
i quit smoking after 38 years ,
exercised , ate right .
and for what ?
even still ,
it was the right move .
here she is , my girl .
how are you , sweetie ?
hey , dad .
what did rosen say ?
how &apos;s the hotel ? you all settled in ?
it &apos;s fine .
how are you , angel ? you look beautiful .
i &apos;m good .
eric sends his love .
that &apos;s nice .
john , what about rosen ?
i don &apos;t know . i ... i don &apos;t know ,
sweetie .
i &apos;m very , very sick .
all right , don &apos;t cry .
don &apos;t cry . you don &apos;t have to make it any harder than it is .
no physical contact , please .
i love you , john .
i love you too , sweetie .
daddy .
i know . i know .
ladies , no contact .
all right .
you come back , you see me again tomorrow .
we have more time , huh ?
could i bum one of those ?
it &apos;s casual , though , right ?
it &apos;s a movie premiere . we should dress accordingly .
it &apos;s a cast @-@ and @-@ crew screening .
it &apos;s in the city , tony ,
with an after @-@ party at a bar in the meatpacking district .
that place is very chic now .
meat packers ? i &apos;m a happily married man .
i &apos;m telling you it &apos;s not dress @-@ up .
speaking of dress @-@ up , christopher said
kelli is having her wedding dress made into
an outfit for the baby to be christened in .
sweet .
you all right ?
are you taking a date to the screening ?
if i can meet a normal guy , maybe .
i heard that .
what , finn wasn &apos;t normal ?
i don &apos;t intend to discuss finn .
what about that guy in your mcat review ?
please , he &apos;s completely fixated on his o @-@ chem final .
he wants to be a doctor . tell him it &apos;s educational .
there &apos;s body parts all over this movie .
screw the movie . i just wanna hang with celebs .
you think you &apos;re gonna get to sleep with paris hilton ?
what ? no .
stop fidgeting and eat your noodles .
i don &apos;t want them .
where are you going ?
the bathroom . jesus .
you two have a fight ?
i don &apos;t know .
keep an eye on his temp . we &apos;ll finish out the week on the ceftin .
you rest now . i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
he should be on heparin .
excuse me .
listen to him . check his abg .
i &apos;m gonna have to ask you again to not interfere , warren .
i &apos;m gonna change your sheets .
what are you , the world &apos;s smartest orderly ?
these days i am .
22 years a practising oncologist ,
specialising in cancers of the liver .
roll to your right , please .
let me spare us the awkwardness .
i killed my wife .
not that it &apos;s any justification ,
i had reason to suspect
she was cheating on me with her chiropractor .
granted , i was abusing cocaine at the time , and alcohol .
but i came home one day ,
shot her four times . twice in the head .
i killed her aunt too .
i didn &apos;t know she was there . roll over , please .
and the mailman .
at that point i had to fully commit .
why are you here exactly ?
i &apos;ve been accused of
being part of a certain ltalian @-@ american subculture .
i know who you are .
i meant what &apos;s wrong with you ?
oh
lungs .
i &apos;ve been wanting to meet you , actually .
i saw you on bill curtis .
warren feldman .
john sacrimoni .
good to know you .
i take it you done chemo ?
twice .
mind if i take a look at your chart ?
what about gunga din ?
gupte ? fuck him .
you &apos;re seeing rosen .
they let me fly to cleveland , my expense .
you know him ?
i saw him speak once
at an asco conference in georgia .
good man .
but ?
actually , very few people know this ,
but he really can &apos;t walk on water .
what was his prognosis ?
three months .
with the treatment you &apos;ve had ?
what do you mean ?
you got a window of one to three years .
what about the metastases ?
two rounds of paraplatin ,
docetaxel and platinol concurrent
with radiation ?
any cancer inside you has slowed to a crawl .
why is he so fucking negative ?
we tell the patient three months . he lives a year . who looks like a hero ?
i &apos;ll see you around , john . you take it easy . hang in there .
fuck me .
tony , morning .
you got a sec ?
as i told you ,
my partner and i are with the joint terror task force now .
you &apos;re around port newark often enough .
we &apos;re concerned about what might come in from the middle east .
yeah , and ...
let &apos;s talk terror funding .
most of it comes about through illegal enterprise .
our pitch is this . it &apos;s the same we gave christopher moltisanti .
maybe he never mentioned it .
if you or any of your people heard of anything going down ,
middle easterners , pakistanis ,
you &apos;d be helping us a lot if you let us know .
i think there &apos;s a word for that .
your daughter takes pre @-@ med classes in new york .
she use the tunnels ?
just something to keep in mind .
that &apos;s the last time i &apos;m going down for the paper .
tell that fucking polack to get here earlier
and bring up the paper with her
or she can go clean somebody else &apos;s toilets .
what happened ?
it &apos;s too dangerous . has been for years .
may i have your attention , please ?
welcome to the premiere of cleaver ,
the story of a young man who goes to pieces
then manages to find himself again .
in all seriousness , however , i &apos;d like to say a few words .
much like a child , a film has many parents ,
that is to say many individuals who act like parents ,
who act like parents ,
or that by a version
the film is their baby .
i , as an executive producer ,
am one of those individuals .
two more examples are here with me tonight .
ladies and gentlemen , my co @-@ ep christopher moltisanti
and our director morgan yam .
yeah , hey !
you &apos;re all psyched to see the movie so i &apos;m not gonna give a big speech here .
i just wanna give a shout out
to the man who , without him ,
this whole thing would be impossible . where is he ?
anthony soprano , everybody .
once he came on board , the whole thing fell together .
and all the other investors too .
plus my wife kelli and our new baby . i love you guys .
ok , then . cellphones off and hope you like the movie .
and hope you like the movie .
you don &apos;t know what ? he &apos;s a fucking rat !
we can &apos;t prove it .
you &apos;re gonna argue with me ?
no , it &apos;s just , i mean , he &apos;s practically like your own son .
i &apos;m sorry , sally . i think we oughta give him a pass .
i didn &apos; t ask you what you fucking think .
motherfucking son of a ...
that &apos;s you .
no .
it is .
you find where this pezzanovante is
and you bring him to the butcher &apos;s shop .
they &apos;re gonna find pieces of this kid all over fucking canarsie .
yeah .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s fine , sweetie .
but for michael to have not called ... the wedding &apos; s in two days .
who , the guatemalan ?
what time is he gonna be there ?
i hate to say this , but he ain &apos; t good enough for you .
i mean , he &apos;s a good kid .
what you need is a man .
tell him to put it in the trunk .
you know how long i &apos;ve been waiting to do that ?
that was neat at the end , the creepy figurine and the crucifix .
i &apos;m glad you caught that , alexandra . very observant .
the sacred and the propane .
there &apos;s a ton of people wearing t @-@ shirts . i told you .
is it so horrible you look nice ?
i &apos;m starving . i need to eat something already .
i asked if you wanted popcorn .
you want me to make you a plate ?
yeah .
what ?
what ? i &apos;ll give you what .
come here . the fucking boss down in the cellar , white bathrobe ,
where &apos;d you get that ?
i don &apos;t know . artistic choice .
seriously though , i &apos;m very proud .
whatever else happens , you made a movie .
nobody can take that away .
a hundred years from now , we &apos;re gone ,
people will be watching this thing .
you know how much lmperia vodka i scored just from this party alone ?
i had a couple of cases put down in your car too .
look at this . the family of early man .
great , thank you .
hey , danny , come here .
take a picture with us . phil leotardo .
larry and i hung out at the set . i don &apos;t know if you know this ,
but the actors , they don &apos;t make up what they say .
even de niro , the girl told me . the script girl .
lorenzo barese .
how you doing ?
you getting enough to eat ?
bryan rawley , us marshal &apos;s service .
the terms of your bail confine you to your home .
say hello to danny ?
yeah .
larry !
call the fucking lawyer !
excuse us , excuse us .
leave him alone , you bastard !
jesus christ .
there &apos;s danny &apos;s manager . i better go talk to him .
there he is .
so how was florida ?
hot and sticky , like my balls .
i spoke to ginny . she &apos;s a wreck .
john &apos;s in the cancer ward .
she &apos;s down the road in some fucking motel .
poor prick .
prison &apos;s not bad enough , fucking lung cancer to boot .
tell me about it
quintuple bypass ,
then the infection ,
seven months of physical therapy .
i &apos;m just now starting to get back to myself again .
sausage , cioppino , anything spicy
put me back in the emergency room , i &apos;m not careful .
all in all , we &apos;re lucky fucks .
i tell myself that every day .
how about you straighten that family out
not for me , anthony .
obviously , healthwise , being a boss is a young man &apos;s game .
between the joint fitters and the carpenters ,
those envelopes are light over 10 % each week .
i feel it too .
word on the street is gerry &apos;s the favourite to take over .
he &apos;s my prot間 ? i don &apos;t stand in his way .
there &apos;s a ringing endorsement .
hey , tony .
doc .
you know danny ?
how you doing ?
got a ticket on the turnpike .
broken windshield wiper . i said he should talk to you .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
no ...
let &apos;s take a picture here .
all right , chill out , doc.if you &apos;re phil leotardo ,
you cannot be happy with the state of affairs , despite appearances .
we &apos;re joined now from bainbridge lsland , washington ,
we &apos;re joined now from bainbridge lsland ,
washington , by jerry &apos;s fellow mob expert manny safier ,
the author of the new book the wise guide to wise guys .
welcome to the programme . how goes the book tour ?
thank you , geraldo . excellent .
jerry , how are you ?
we &apos;re discussing the apparent mob power vacuum here in new york city .
are you shocked that there &apos;s still no successor to john sacrimoni ?
not really .
i mean , the last ten , 1.2 years ,
that &apos;s been a dysfunctional family .
and as jerry said earlier , there are several viable candidates .
viable , i don &apos; t know .
you had phil leotardo as the logical successor .
you also have gerardo &quot; gerry &quot; torciano ,
also faustino &quot; doc &quot; santoro , who i believe is the front runner .
i &apos;m surprised you haven &apos; t mentioned carmine lupertazzi , jr .
i was about to before you interrupted .
in fact , if you take a look at my book in chapter 1.4 ...
this santoro thing , i called it a year ago .
hey .
thank you for coming , anthony .
i know it &apos;s a long trip .
and miss a chance to see missouri ?
so how &apos;s ginny today ?
she went to buy some stuff for the kitchenette .
good . clear her mind .
reason i asked you here today ,
she &apos;s a bright kid , your sister .
but business ...
my life insurance ,
i want to put her on a monthly stipend .
probably a good idea .
not all the doctors agree .
but if i do only have a few months ,
i wanna take care of all this now .
wait a second . which doctor doesn &apos;t agree ?
feldman , the guy i told you about .
the wife @-@ murderer ?
he &apos;s still a doctor .
he was a highly respected oncologist .
i know , but , john ...
he reviewed my case .
he says i could hang on for years .
you &apos;re right . he still has the knowledge .
oj &apos;s no less of a running back , right ?
let me ask you something , anthony .
how will i be remembered ?
a wonderful husband .
a loving father .
on the street , though , i mean .
from what i know , you were well @-@ liked .
respected across the board , despite the allocution .
god knows , guys have actually named names
for a lot less than what you were looking at .
the only nega ...
what ?
when carmine died and you took over ,
people felt you changed ,
became a little trigger @-@ happy ,
maybe , a hothead .
god forbid any of them
would find themselves in that position .
it &apos;s a thankless job .
why are you so pissy ?
portrayal of that guy in the movie .
what guy ?
the boss , tony .
what about him ?
it was based on you .
i know , you said . the yelling .
it wasn &apos;t just the yelling .
imitation &apos;s a form of flattery .
you think that was flattering ?
it was ok .
he &apos;s a tough prick , that baldwin .
what about the girlfriend ?
what girlfriend ?
the cleaver guy .
the lead character . his entire motive for revenge .
i don &apos;t know . you lost me , carm .
sally boy , the boss , he fucked the guy &apos;s fiancee
the thing with adriana ?
i told you it never fucking happened .
apparently your nephew feels otherwise .
ro pointed it out to me . if she saw it , other people did .
it &apos;s a movie . it &apos;s fictional .
it &apos;s a revenge fantasy , tony ,
which ends with the boss &apos;s head split open by a meat cleaver .
there he is . good time last night ?
yeah , it was all right . how about you ?
gab had fucking nightmares .
club soda , hon .
so what did you think of the movie ?
chrissy &apos;s the last person i would have confused with marty ,
but i gotta say , it wasn &apos;t bad .
is he around ?
chrissy ? nah .
he don &apos;t come around here no more .
that baldwin was pretty good , huh ?
he was a mean fuck . i &apos;ll give him that .
and that girl that played the fiancee , she was hot ,
the one he was fucking .
it &apos;s weird how it works , the creative process .
i &apos;m watching edward scissorhands
when boom , all of a sudden , it hits me .
what if instead of a pair of scissors , it &apos;s a meat cleaver instead ?
a couple years later , you got a movie .
originally i thought a ball @-@ peen hammer , but a cleaver &apos;s better .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m living somebody else &apos;s life .
you &apos;re not comfortable with success yet .
i know . it &apos;s scary .
feel the fear and do it anyway .
without chemicals , either .
so , kelli , the baby .
good , fucking great .
she &apos;s a doll . she cries a lot , though .
the baby , not kelli .
i hope you &apos;re taking the time to reflect on all this .
savour the good stuff .
yeah ... no , i am .
there &apos;s my other sober buddy .
is that an fbl guy ?
your tax dollars at work .
does he follow you around all the time ?
they drop in and out . it &apos;s fun .
look , seriously , think where you were just three months ago .
at that meeting you were so fucked up you could barely talk .
that woman friend was even worse .
i &apos;ve been trying to do what you said .
hold back a little , steer clear of old habits , same people .
must be hard , though , given your lifestyle .
they misinterpret i don &apos;t wanna hang around so much .
fucking paulie especially .
have you explained how hard it is to be around alcohol ?
how familiar surroundings set it off ? they don &apos;t give a fuck .
but he &apos;s fucking my wife , carmine . i want him dead ,
jimmy says .
he will be , but not just right now .
he earns too much .
eight years later , jimmy gets a call one day .
remember that guy we were talking about who &apos;s fucking your wife ?
he can go .
the guy wasn &apos;t making him money no more .
and that was carmine lupertazzi .
holy fucking shit .
there you are . we went ...
john , what the hell are you doing ?
what ?
you &apos;re smoking .
so ?
daddy , you &apos;re on oxygen .
warren , pardon me , i &apos;m sorry .
just calm down , all right ?
calm down ? i don &apos;t believe you .
what have i got to lose , gin ?
what &apos;s the difference ?
you said dr feldman doesn &apos;t agree with the others .
yeah , well .
miracles do happen , john .
not to this family .
it &apos;s that kind of attitude that probably brought this on .
you &apos;re gonna start with that again ?
what about all these six @-@ year @-@ olds with leukaemia ?
what &apos;s that from , their negative thinking ?
all due respect , he &apos;s a great guy , doc ,
but boss material ?
phil , though , i &apos;ll never get it .
the man was my mentor . it was there for the taking .
his heart , gerry . what was he gonna do ?
that &apos;s my point , what you just said .
johnny goes away.it &apos;s phil &apos;s turn in the driver &apos;s seat
and his heart gives out .
his heart .
i know . what ?
it &apos;s a metaphor . he lost his balls is what i &apos;m saying .
just say it , then . walt fucking whitman over here .
ladies .
shall we get some more wine ?
is this fucking waiter on sabbatical ?
what &apos;s the name of that sangiovese we had at quattro gatti ?
the night your ...
come on .
let &apos;s go .
yeah , give me five dimes apiece
on st louis , minnesota
and baltimore .
i would have invited you to play , but we already had our fourth .
you &apos;re not happy .
let &apos;s order .
what can i get you ? seared ahi , mixed greens
and an iced tea , please .
philly cheesesteak .
give me an arnold palmer instead of the iced tea .
i enjoy those ,
but it never occurs to me to order one .
what the fuck , carmine ?
this family of yours .
fucking senile doc santoro uses one of my guys as a diversion ?
sil could have got hurt .
doc showed a lack of respect .
this fucking leadership , boy .
step up , carmine
get your hands around this thing . you know you got the support .
you never thought you &apos;d mutter those words .
what do you want me to say ?
i hear you , tony , and i &apos;m flattered .
but boss , i don &apos;t think so ,
especially now that doc has cemented his position .
phil was bad enough in the top spot ,
but him i could have lived with .
there was a time i was obsessed with being in charge .
you remember .
so do it .
one night around then i had this dream .
it &apos;s my pop &apos;s 100th birthday , even though he was dead .
the whole family &apos;s there .
he &apos;s wearing one of these gold paper crowns ,
like at burger king .
anyway , i give him his present , this mellifluous box , ribbons .
he opens it up then looks at me .
this gaze of absolute disappointment .
there &apos;s nothing in the box .
so he hands it back to me .
&quot; go fill it up , &quot; he says .
&quot; come back when i &apos;m 200 . &quot;
so go for it , carmine .
fulfil that part of yourself .
we have this ritual at my house for years .
our kids are in boarding school .
every night i come home from work , i strip down , jump naked in the pool .
nicole brings me a scotch and water .
we sit , relax a little , talk .
i go up to bed , the air conditioning .
she brings me a light dinner on a tray .
one night during all that fighting with john ,
i come home , i &apos;m exhausted .
so tired , so tense , i skip the pool .
i go right upstairs , flop on the bed .
nicole comes up with a drink .
she says , &quot; darling ,
i think it &apos;s time you took a rest . &quot;
i say , &quot; i &apos;m gonna . we &apos;ll take a vacation . &quot;
she says , &quot; that &apos;s not what i meant .
&quot; l don &apos;t wanna be the wealthiest widow on long lsland . &quot;
&quot; l want you to quit now . &quot;
i &apos;m not ashamed to say that she made me cry .
that wonderful loving woman .
that dream with my father , the empty box ...
it wasn &apos;t about being boss .
it was about being happy .
warren , hi .
hi , hon . how &apos;s he doing ?
listen , i &apos;ve been meaning to talk to you about the smoking .
john shared with me how upset you were .
psychologically , when a person &apos;s told they &apos;re dying ,
it &apos;s the ultimate loss of control .
to hear him wheeze like that .
i know . it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i do know he &apos;s a leader .
i suspect his smoking on some level
is an attempt to die as he lived ,
in total control .
years ago i asked him to stop for me and the kids .
i lost 27 lbs . he couldn &apos;t quit smoking ?
i gotta go .
goodbye , caitlin . i &apos;ll see you soon , muffin .
oh , my god . i love these little hands .
thanks so much for watching her .
you &apos;d think we &apos;re planning a coronation , not a christening .
we all set ?
you know what ? i &apos;d better pee .
goody , i get to keep holding you .
so how you doing ? tony said you got an offer on a house you built .
two , actually , yes .
ivana trump .
i gotta be honest . i am very disappointed at what you did .
what are you talking about ?
your movie .
the boss sleeping with the other guy &apos;s fiancee ?
what ?
like it wasn &apos;t based on tony and ade .
what ? no .
carmela , i didn &apos;t even write it .
&quot; story by christopher moltisanti . &quot;
lsn &apos;t that what it said on the screen ?
that &apos;s just for the writers guild health insurance .
oh , really ?
come on , you can &apos;t be serious .
she &apos;s an oriental , for christ &apos;s sake .
have you heard from ade lately ?
no . why would i hear from her ?
would it be so surprising ?
she left me for some other guy .
is it any wonder ?
her poor mother is so upset , she &apos;s practically delusional .
she &apos;s convinced herself that ade is dead .
her mother &apos;s an alkie . you know that .
regardless , christopher .
you &apos;re my cousin and i love you , carmela ,
but i don &apos;t like what you &apos;re inferring ,
either with the movie or with how i treated adriana .
kelli comes out , tell her i went to smoke .
there &apos;s my pal . how you doing ?
billy bathgate . they had it in the library .
i thought of you .
i don &apos;t know if you heard , but gerry torciano ,
he was hit last week in brooklyn .
who ?
gerry torciano .
it was all over the news .
they whacked him in some restaurant .
did you know him ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t know . good guy .
it &apos;s hard to breathe .
i &apos;ll talk to gupte ,
see if i can get him to up the beclovent .
i &apos;m dying , aren &apos;t l ?
it &apos;s not good .
i won &apos;t lie to you .
the aggressiveness surprises me
i gotta concur with rosen .
i appreciate everything you &apos;ve done , warren .
who is it ?
you don &apos;t answer your phone ?
i shut the ringer . it &apos;s the middle of the night .
honey , what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing , sweetie , it &apos;s fine . go back to sleep .
it ain &apos;t fine . we got a problem .
that sequence with sally boy banging the fiancee ,
you gotta tell tony that was your idea .
it wasn &apos;t my idea .
what , are you fucking stupid ? he probably thinks i put it in to embarrass him .
why did you put it in there ?
it was an idea .
i don &apos;t know . who knows where they come from ?
newton invented gravity cos some asshole hit him with an apple .
it &apos;s bad enough that i don &apos;t get credit for my ideas .
i must take responsibility for some shit that &apos;s gonna get me in trouble ?
fuck that , man .
humanitis award . what &apos;s that ?
humanitas . from the paulist brothers .
for writing socially redeeming ...
look out the window . you see a fucking hollywood sign out there ?
maybe you talk to your agent like that ,
but don &apos;t ever get snippy on me again .
the scary thing was i didn &apos;t know what happened
till after the shot was fired .
fucking weird .
tony , hey . gentlemen .
hey , how are you ?
tj hooker .
jt , actually ,
but i &apos;m looking for chris .
i &apos;m supposed to meet him .
what , here ?
the thing is he left me a message
but this fucking verizon ...
mind if i wait ?
yeah , sit down .
diet coke , please .
so what did you think of cleaver ?
it &apos;s good , you know .
congratulations .
i hope we &apos;re gonna see some money soon .
yeah .
as a writer , you can never tell .
you come up with an idea . you don &apos;t know how the audience will respond .
i mean , just cos i like something i think of
doesn &apos;t mean anyone else will .
that &apos;s the challenge .
it is challenging sometimes ,
inventing characters , how they interact .
the boss sally boy for example ,
his whole persona ,
i stole that from broderick crawford in born yesterday .
what &apos;s that ?
garson kanin , 1950 . it &apos;s terrific .
william holden falls in love with crawford &apos;s girlfriend , played by
judy holliday .
the black girl , the singer .
no , that &apos;s billie holiday .
although judy &apos;s character in the movie is
named billie too , so i see why you &apos;re confused .
i &apos;ve never seen it . why would i be confused ?
anyway , the sally boy character
is based on crawford , sort of a big , burly guy .
the love triangle , the cuckolding of michael , sleeping with the fiancee ,
very similar to the holden @-@ holliday dynamic .
so the whole thing was your idea
what happened to your head ?
oh . cabinet . duh .
if i see chrissy , i &apos;ll tell him you were looking for him .
this is the image of me he leaves to the world .
i remember when he was born , i would hold him in my arms .
he was an adorable kid , too .
big eyes .
you always talk about him
more like a son .
in some ways he was ,
especially after his dad died .
he was little . i used to give him rides .
i &apos;d put him in the basket of the butcher bike
and pedal him around ,
back when satriale &apos;s made deliveries .
i reminded him of that recently .
he didn &apos;t remember .
but you do .
we had fun .
all those memories , and for what ?
all i am to him is some asshole bully .
you &apos;re hurt .
his dad dickie
as like my me to him .
a mentor .
yeah , but more than that .
a friend ,
a fucking guy you could look up to .
and the hope is that you pass that shit down ,
the respect and the love .
all i did for this fucking kid
and he fucking hates me so much .
i &apos;m sure on some level he loves you too .
yeah ?
take that home . judge for yourself .
last five minutes should answer that .
i &apos;m not going to do that .
not a horror fan ?
it &apos;s what you think that matters .
i think he fucking despises me . it &apos;s pretty obvious .
wants to see me dead .
without invalidating your feelings ,
i &apos;ve been coming here for years .
i know too much about the subconscious now .
look , sweetie ,
they &apos;re nice and clean like you like them .
mommy , he can &apos;t really hear you .
they &apos;re right here by the bed .
my ...
what , baby , your what ?
want more morphine , daddy ?
mo ... mother .
grandma ? what , daddy ?
is he hallucinating ?
i don &apos;t know . he could be .
sometimes they see people who &apos;ve passed .
john , look at me , baby .
you want a cigarette , baby ? john ?
you can &apos;t do that when you &apos;re on my fucking team ?
hey , tone , anthony lnfante to see you .
send him in .
there he is . x @-@ ray specs .
how &apos;s john ?
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here , tony .
john passed away late this morning .
fuck . you &apos;re kidding me .
i only wish .
he was a great guy , john . sorry for your loss .
thanks . honestly , though , it was for the best .
what are you gonna do ?
i beat cancer , but it took him out .
ride the painted pony at the spin @-@ a @-@ wheel glide .
huh ?
john sacrimoni .
we &apos;re here to celebrate what would have been my brother &apos;s ,
your uncle &apos;s , 47th birthday .
blow it out for him .
right here at this bar , this seat
was uncle billy &apos;s favourite place in the world .
more than shea stadium ?
more than shea stadium .
he &apos;d sit with his friends and tell stories about his family ,
who he loved more than anything and was so very proud of .
from now on , his ashes will be right here
so when his friends come to visit , he can see them .
can he see us now ?
yeah .
who knows who is leonardo da vinci ?
i do .
matty .
yeah , he wrote the da vinci code .
another man wrote that , but it &apos;s a hideous , sacrilegious book .
annabella .
he was a painter , of the mona lisa .
very good . he was not only a painter , he did medical drawings
and designed a tank .
leonardo was a great ltalian
and that was our name originally , leonardo .
but many years ago , when my grandpa came over from sicily ,
they changed it at ellis lsland to leotardo .
what did they do that for ?
because they &apos;re stupid , that &apos;s why , and jealous .
they disrespected a proud ltalian heritage
and named us after a ballet costume .
marissa . that &apos;s for modern.in ballet , you wear tutus .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference .
that &apos;s right , it doesn &apos;t .
can we have cake now ?
how you doing , phil ?
you ok ?
47 . he was a fucking kid .
me , i &apos;m an old man .
i &apos;d like to do it over , boy . let me tell you .
i fucking compromised everything .
nah . what are you talking about ?
20 years inside ,
not a fucking peep .
for what ? to protect the likes of rusty fucking millio ,
doc santoro ?
you were a man , phil . that &apos;s saying a lot nowadays .
that cocksucking piece of shit , tony soprano &apos;s cousin ,
i can &apos;t even say his name ,
murdered billy . and what did i do about it ?
my weakness .
sometimes i think it &apos;s in my dna .
my family took shit from the medigans
the minute we got off the boat .
the minute we got off the boat .
leotardo .
that &apos;s my fucking legacy .
no more , butchie .
