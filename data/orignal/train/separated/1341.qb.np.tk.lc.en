chicken pox ?
no .
chlamydia ?
really ?
i &apos;ll take that as a &quot; no . &quot;
deep vein thrombosis ?
no .
how about depression ?
only since you started asking me all these questions .
let me remind you that if you &apos;d gone to your regular o.b. ,
we wouldn &apos;t have to fill out new @-@ patient forms .
well , let me remind you my regular o.b.
is two blocks from the house i grew up in .
the staff knows people in my neighborhood ,
and people talk .
i don &apos;t want casey &apos;s mom finding out about this pregnancy
before i have a chance to tell him .
are you having second thoughts about not marrying casey ?
no .
i mean , i love casey , and i know that he loves me .
but we decided that marriage isn &apos;t right for us now .
are you worried he won &apos;t understand ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t want to hurt him .
you just need to talk to him and speak from the heart .
yeah .
well , until i get it figured out ,
the only person that i trust
knowing about this pregnancy is you .
you and this complete stranger who will now be my o.b.-gyn.
uh , i -- - otherwise , i just -- i just want to keep it a secret .
your mom knows you &apos;re pregnant .
i &apos;ll wait in the car .
i didn &apos;t actually tell your mother .
she somehow knew , and then i confirmed it .
i don &apos;t really even know how it happened .
i am so sorry .
she use the latin thing on you ?
et non dico mendacium quaestiones ?
yeah , that &apos;s it .
and then did she tell you about her psychic grandmother
and take your hand and say
that she could tell if you were lying
just by running her fingers across your palm ?
but it felt so real and honest .
her grandmother died when she was 5 .
i &apos;m such an idiot .
no , no .
you just fell for her well @-@ oiled routine .
i mean , frankie couldn &apos;t get away with anything as a kid
because she was always weaseling a confession out of him .
sounds like a cop i know .
maybe the apple doesn &apos;t fall too far from the tree .
was that a veiled reference to my potential parenting style ?
i wouldn &apos;t call it &quot; veiled . &quot;
all right , well , let me handle this .
i don &apos;t want her to make it about you .
don &apos;t let her use the latin on you .
what ?
is there something you want to ask me about ?
why ? no , no .
is there something you want to tell me ?
what is it you think i know ?
you tell me .
i don &apos;t know .
ma , i know you know . i spoke to maura .
thank you for finally telling me !
i &apos;m so happy for you , jane . i am so proud of you !
thank you .
so , what about you and casey ?
we &apos;ve already made a decision about our relationship , okay ?
jane , you have to have --
ma , this baby is my responsibility , okay ?
don &apos;t push the casey thing .
okay , fine .
and don &apos;t tell anybody .
me ?
i &apos;m serious , ma , okay ?
if the department finds out that i &apos;m pregnant ,
i could be reassigned to desk duty .
okay , what &apos;s so bad about a desk job ?
i like being a cop .
you &apos;re about to be a mother , too .
today , i &apos;m still just a cop .
you know , that &apos;s not exactly all @-@ terrain footwear .
maybe we should have sacrificed fashion for comfort .
i &apos;m getting my field boots resoled .
i &apos;m fine .
yeah , &quot; fine &quot; and wincing don &apos;t exactly go together .
well , my feet only hurt
because i &apos;m taking a new yoga class to strengthen them .
but i &apos;m in a transition period ,
and soon , i &apos;ll be able to wear any size heel anywhere .
lady gaga will be so proud of you .
what do we got ?
park worker found him this morning around 8 : 00 .
witnesses ?
no .
there are two wounds --
one to the ear with significant tissue loss
and an entrance wound to the chest .
so through and through ?
no .
i feel it is likely a projectile in the subcutaneous tissue .
shot alert picked up two shots --
10 : 58 , 10 : 59 last night .
well , given the stage of rigor mortis ,
that fits the window for the time of death .
i got frankie setting up a line search .
anything else ?
i &apos;ve got footprints heading up the hill .
yeah , two sets .
and we have blood drops .
okay , so ... he was shot
and then took off running with someone chasing him .
.30 @-@ 30 .
and where &apos;s the other shell casing ?
korsak .
who leaves a murder weapon where we can find it ?
somebody who thinks it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;ll get csru to process it .
what the hell was going on up here last night ?
well , the victim didn &apos;t have a wallet .
it &apos;s a lot of work to steal a wallet .
maybe it was a sex crime , drug deal gone wrong ,
random shooting .
so , outside of an attack by aliens ,
you &apos;re not willing to rule anything out ?
i won &apos;t even rule out the little green men .
they &apos;re a slippery bunch .
you &apos;re gonna want to see what we found .
you okay ?
since when do i need help walking through the woods ?
can &apos;t a brother just give his sister a hand ?
yeah , if he wants to lose it .
does that look like a fresh grave to you ?
yep .
well , i guess we can scratch one thing off your list .
this wasn &apos;t random .
got a hit on the victim &apos;s fingerprints .
he was in the army reserve back in the &apos; 90s .
carl ulrich , 37 .
our victim was a steelworker ,
but he lost his job six years ago .
no vehicle registration , no credit cards ,
no phone listing .
his last known address is five years old .
criminal record ?
this guy didn &apos;t even have a parking ticket .
well , he only died yesterday ,
so he &apos;s been somewhere , doing something .
let &apos;s figure out what that was .
all right .
someone didn &apos;t want you finding this serial number .
you changed the oil .
i was working on an art project ,
and that &apos;s all i could find at the hardware store .
it actually mixes better with the metal particles
than what we were using before .
art project ?
i etched the bust and skyline
on a salvaged piece of flatiron .
then i filed it off .
we &apos;re ready . you can attach the magnets .
everyone thought i was trying
to make some statement on disposability ,
but when the tiny metal particles
started to fill in the imperceptible grooves ...
voila ?
cityscape .
which was a statement on ... ?
i just thought it was cool .
i didn &apos;t know you were an artist .
before medical school , i studied art in paris for a year .
so , tell me something that &apos;ll surprise me
about sergeant detective vince korsak .
i cut an album before i was a cop .
look at that .
a riddle wrapped inside of an enigma .
you &apos;re standing on balls .
they &apos;re massaging my feet .
i have a simpler fix -- stop wearing high heels .
like i said , it &apos;s not from the heels .
this is part of my new strengthening regime .
i e @-@ mailed my yoga teacher about my metatarsal discomfort ,
and she suggested knobby balls .
not even gonna go there .
it &apos;s a spin on the ancient chinese practice
of walking on cobblestones .
the balls -- they connect with the pressure points on my feet ,
which correspond to major organs .
you should think about some elements of chinese medicine
now that you &apos;re ... pregnant .
thought about it . no .
well , at least you &apos;re keeping an open mind .
what do we know about ballistics ?
the bullet that i removed from our victim
was a .22 caliber .
we found a .30 @-@ 30 rifle at the crime scene .
yeah , and our victim nearly got his ear shot off
by a large @-@ caliber bullet
consistent with the rifle you recovered ,
but the fatal shot came from a .22 .
it entered his chest at the second intercostal
and nicked his subclavian artery .
how long would it have taken him to bleed out ?
the elevated heart rate from adrenaline and physical exertion
resulted in massive internal bleeding .
it happened very quickly .
so ... he ran himself to death ?
in a manner of speaking , yes .
also , while his jeans and shirt were worn and frayed ,
they were also clean and ironed .
and the even growth of his hair indicates a recent haircut ,
and the work boots he was wearing were new .
so wherever he was going , he dressed himself up a bit .
what &apos;s that about ?
my life coach
always stresses the importance of dressing for success .
usually , that &apos;s good advice .
susie raised the serial number on the rifle .
we also realized it was jammed ,
which is probably why the killer dropped it .
and the chase is why the victim wasn &apos;t buried as planned .
let &apos;s run the serial number through ncic .
did he say &quot; life coach &quot; ?
don &apos;t ask .
i found someone who worked with ulrich six years ago .
he said he was a good guy but kept to himself .
did he know what he &apos;d been doing since he lost his job ?
someone on the plant floor said that they saw him
go into a soup kitchen near the steel yard a while back .
word was he lost his house
and was living out of a storage unit .
did you check it out ?
the unit was empty .
manager said he &apos;d cleaned it out two days ago .
i also went to the soup kitchen .
minister told me that he &apos;d been in there last week .
he was upbeat because he just landed a new job .
where ?
minister didn &apos;t know .
can i get you a cup of coffee ?
yeah , sure .
have a seat .
thanks .
uh , decaf , right ?
frankie .
yeah ?
is there something you &apos;d like to tell me ?
yes .
it &apos;s been killing me .
congratulations .
now i can stop being nice to you for no reason .
oh , yeah . i wouldn &apos;t want you to develop any bad habits .
how &apos;d you find out ?
ma .
hello .
ma .
you promised me that you wouldn &apos;t say anything to anybody .
jane , frankie isn &apos;t anybody . he &apos;s your brother .
telling anybody would be like blabbing it
to a perfect stranger .
hey , you , did you hear me say anything
about my daughter being pregnant ?
ni zai shuo shen me ? !
see ?
you have no idea what he just said .
no , but did you hear him say anything about ... a baby ?
how do you argue with that ?
i &apos;m warning you -- one word gets out about this ,
and i &apos;m gonna name the baby after constantina .
you are never to speak her name .
who &apos;s constantina ?
her cousin .
el diablo !
why , you . you wouldn &apos;t dare .
boy or girl ...
constantina rizzoli .
and now ... i go to lunch .
have ma fill you in on old cousin consty .
we got a hit on the rifle .
it belongs to john brooks ,
a 39 @-@ year @-@ old white male with a record
of drunk and disorderly conduct and assault .
we have a current address ?
yeah , d street in southie .
i guess lunch will have to wait .
guess again .
that &apos;s the best reuben i &apos;ve ever had .
it all starts with the meat .
o &apos;malley &apos;s cures their own corned beef .
why do they call it corned beef ?
i mean , what &apos;s corn got to do with it ?
that &apos;s john brooks &apos; car .
and that looks like our guy .
i got him .
boston police .
what the hell &apos;s going on ? !
are you john brooks ?
no . i &apos;m ralph comstock .
that &apos;s what his license says .
why are you driving brooks &apos; car ?
we were roommates . i bought it from him .
i just , uh , haven &apos;t gotten around to re @-@ registering it .
where is he ?
john ? i don &apos;t have any idea .
that &apos;s why i called you guys a year ago .
that &apos;s when he went missing .
i &apos;m telling you , john &apos;s no killer .
then how did his rifle end up at a murder scene ?
i don &apos;t know . but i know john .
we -- we &apos;ve been best friends since we were kids .
we grew up in southie , played mighty mites baseball together .
well , then , you know about his criminal record .
he &apos;s not exactly an altar boy .
sure , but that was because of his drinking .
he cleaned up his act way before he went missing .
so , what happened a year ago ?
john got a new job .
he was gonna be a caretaker on a farm .
who was he working for ?
i don &apos;t know .
where was the farm ?
i &apos;m not sure .
ah , come on . you got to do better than that .
i wish i could .
all i know is he answered an ad on the internet .
he interviewed , got the job ,
packed up all of his stuff -- his clothes , his tools .
his rifle ?
everything .
he even took our mighty mites baseball trophy .
said it would remind him of the good times .
if he applied for a job online , whose computer did he use ?
we shared an old laptop .
did he take it with him , or do you still have it ?
i have it .
i spilled coffee on the keys . it fritzed up .
we &apos;re gonna need to see that .
sure . it &apos;s in the closet of my apartment .
what else can you tell us about john ?
he loves dogs , pizza ...
he &apos;s diabetic .
look , i know he made some bad choices ,
but i &apos;m telling you , john brooks was a good guy .
whatever you think he did , you &apos;re wrong .
both these guys are similar .
both grew up in southie , both out of work .
both down on their luck when they find a new job .
and then , one &apos;s dead and the other goes missing .
when did ralph say that brooks went missing ?
march 23rd , last year .
shot alert recorded a single gunshot near blackstone park .
unit responded but didn &apos;t find anything .
it &apos;s a big park .
i &apos;ll organize a team to search it tomorrow .
i guess that means we &apos;re done for the day .
well , there is ...
one other thing we have to talk about .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a file with the names and the service records
of potential replacements for frost .
what ?
brass gave it to me this morning .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s too soon to talk about this .
nobody &apos;s saying we have to bring someone in right away .
we can &apos;t replace him , vince . he &apos;s irreplaceable .
i know . i know . i know .
but ... i &apos;ve got orders to begin the process ,
and i wanted you to have some say in it .
i &apos;ll go organize the search for tomorrow .
i can &apos;t believe that they want to replace him already .
i just think they don &apos;t want your job to be any harder
than it already is .
yeah , but replacing frost isn &apos;t gonna help that .
no , but a bureaucracy can &apos;t know that .
i just miss him so much .
i know .
you know , i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t mean to dump this on you .
i know you &apos;re sad , too .
it &apos;s okay .
what &apos;s going on ?
well , we were gonna go to dinner
and wanted to know if you wanted to join us .
ma told you i was back in a.a. ?
yeah . i &apos;m really proud of you .
that the only reason you came by ?
and i figured she told you i was pregnant .
my big sister &apos;s gonna have a baby !
it &apos;s so exciting .
yeah . exciting .
the first thing we got to get you
is the tough love carrier .
it &apos;s waterproof , which is key ,
&apos;cause little ones are pooping and peeing machines .
no , what i need is ... is for you to keep this quiet .
yeah , absolutely . no problem . totally get it .
thank you .
hey , everyone , this is jane .
congratulations on the baby .
thanks .
bye , judy .
is there anyone in boston you haven &apos;t told ?
don &apos;t worry . everything in a.a. is confidential .
let &apos;s get something to eat .
yes . let &apos;s .
yes .
so , did you have any trouble
with the collapsible triggers on the jogging stroller ?
instructions on all baby gear is impossible .
you just got to take your time
and have a good swedish dictionary handy .
really ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t know any swedish .
me neither .
what &apos;s the word ?
corrupted .
the hard drive is fried .
all we &apos;ve been able to retrieve is a photo of a farm
that we think was connected to an ad for the job .
trouble is , we don &apos;t know if brooks created the ad .
he could have just been answering it .
all right , well , let &apos;s analyze the photo ,
see if we can locate the farm .
maybe that &apos;ll help us i.d. the killer .
oh , my god !
is that what you call a breakfast ?
no ... not without coffee .
may i please see the package ?
do you know what &apos;s in here ?
yummy goodness ?
calcium carbonate .
does that sound yummy ?
it comes from rocks .
sodium stearate ... that &apos;s used in soap .
and do you know where you can find titanium dioxide ?
right there .
latex paint .
do industrial chemicals sound like a good thing to be putting in your body ?
not anymore .
hey , korsak .
buzzkill .
well , she &apos;s right here .
okay , we &apos;ll be right there .
i am not a buzzkill .
nutrition &apos;s more important now than ever .
the first trimester is the most critical
in terms of the development of the organs ,
the nervous system , the arms , the fingers , legs , toes .
i was just eating a cupcake .
i didn &apos;t mean it as a hostile act .
can you tell how long he &apos;s been in the ground ?
i can &apos;t be certain until i examine the remains .
maura , &quot; approximately &quot; isn &apos;t gonna hurt you .
science is not a guessing game .
you want me to get another cupcake ?
a year or more is likely .
what &apos;s that by his wrist ?
diabetes bracelet .
约翰 · 布鲁克斯
well , now we know john brooks didn &apos;t go missing .
all this poor guy wanted was a job .
this is what he got instead .
hey . anything new ?
we searched the hell out of the internet .
we found an ad with the same farm photo on two other websites .
did you i.d. who placed the ad ?
guy used a fake name and paid for his bill with bitcoins .
what about i.p. addresses ?
back to internet cafes .
looks like the ad &apos;s a dead end .
well , the photo isn &apos;t .
susie identified those as fraxinus quadrangus .
english ?
the trees -- blue ash .
they &apos;re found almost exclusively in western ohio .
did you get an address ?
no .
but we found a highway number -- route 422 .
runs east / west .
i &apos;m guessing through western ohio .
yeah .
this landmass matches something called campbell hill .
which i bet is also in western ohio .
this storage facility has been there for 15 years .
well , if the farm no longer exists , the ad is a fake .
just a way to lure out men looking for work
in order to kill them .
we found that ad in multiple places ,
which could mean the killer has attempted this several times .
i &apos;ll run the profile through ncic for similar crimes .
i &apos;ll dig into the farm .
maybe our killer is connected to it .
let &apos;s hope so . might be the only way we have to find him .
dental records confirmed -- this is john brooks .
single gunshot wound through the occipital region with a large @-@ caliber bullet .
like one from the gun we found at the first crime scene ?
certainly possible .
i don &apos;t know if &quot; irony &quot; is the right word
for getting killed with your own gun .
what can i do for you , sergeant ?
i ran an ncic search on unsolved murders that match our victims --
urban areas , unemployed men between the ages of 25 and 40 .
well , i suspect that yielded a plethora of hits .
i &apos;ll be retired before i get through them all .
i was hoping maybe you could help me narrow my search .
we only have two data points .
well , do the best you can .
the killer is taking the victims away from where they live .
he &apos;s stealing their wallets , their identities ,
and burying them --
not only , i suspect ,
to ensure that he gets away with the crimes ,
but also to make them anonymous .
okay .
i &apos;m not a psychiatrist , so it wouldn &apos;t be ethical
for me to make a clinical diagnosis .
but hypothetically , i &apos;d say ...
he &apos;s a malignant narcissist --
unable to empathize ,
only investing emotionally in things he can control .
like our victims &apos; destinies .
yes .
and to him , these victims are worthless ,
as he himself feels .
he strips them of everything .
even the dignity
for their loved ones to know that they &apos;re dead .
i would do a search and include john does
whose bodies have never been claimed by family .
thanks , doc .
i knew there was a reason i come down here .
anytime , sergeant .
the only trace evidence we found on brooks &apos; remains
is a single , long , gray hair .
well , that obviously didn &apos;t come from the victim .
no , but if it came from the killer ,
that would make him a middle @-@ aged male with long , gray hair .
thanks for going out on a limb .
well , a llama seemed unlikely .
is everything okay ?
yeah .
no .
want to talk about it ?
i just -- i feel like
i finally got everything settled with casey --
you know , about our lives , our -- our marriage .
you did .
right .
but now that i &apos;m pregnant with his child ,
it just makes it so much more complicated .
i know .
i mean , even the way i tell him seems difficult .
do i e @-@ mail him or -- or call or skype ?
and how is he gonna react when i tell him
that i intend on raising this child without him ?
is he gonna be mad ? is he gonna be hurt ?
is -- is he gonna fight me ?
is he gonna come running back ?
you know , it &apos;s overwhelming ,
but , uh , you don &apos;t have to rush it .
you know , you can talk to him when you &apos;re ready .
yeah .
except that he contacted me ...
and he wants to talk -- tonight .
i reran the ncic search
and found several murders that fit our profile .
they go from columbus to pittsburgh to boston .
there &apos;s a direct line from that farm in ohio to our backyard .
what &apos;s the most recent case ?
the unsolved murder of a 31 @-@ year @-@ old , unemployed man .
his body was found in the woods near a rest stop 18 months ago .
let me guess -- shot in the back of the head .
yep . and get this .
he left a message for his landlord
the day before he disappeared
saying that he just landed a great job at a farm .
what about his belongings ?
all his stuff , including his 2004 green ford pickup ,
still missing .
what if these crimes are just old @-@ fashioned robbery / homicides ?
none of these guys are that well off .
but their stuff can be easily liquidated --
i mean , tools , guns , trucks .
what &apos;s a 2004 pickup truck go for these days ?
10 , 11 grand .
well , that &apos;s a lot more than you get in a bank robbery .
and the killer is anonymous to everyone
except the person he &apos;s pretending to hire .
mm @-@ hmm . and that person has no connections .
you know what ?
maybe it &apos;s time we applied for a new job .
we should answer that internet ad .
yes . i will , uh , pick a job application .
oh , i got it . why don &apos;t you call it a day ?
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;ll do the application .
i &apos;ve got something else to do here tonight .
i was gonna stay anyway .
go . get some rest .
okay .
okay .
i &apos;ll , uh ... i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
&quot; i &apos;m a 32 @-@ year @-@ old , single , former construction worker
looking for a new lease on life . &quot;
blah , blah , blah .
&quot; mechanically inclined ... have my own tools . &quot;
that &apos;s good .
i would maybe just make the time spent
at your previous job shorter
so it seems like you bounced around .
great .
i also thought i would add that my father recently passed away
and i have no other relations .
i suspect that would be very appealing to our killer .
what ? no heels ?
cramps .
long story .
but don &apos;t tell jane .
is everything okay with her ?
why ?
well , i mean , i know she &apos;s taken frost &apos;s death hard ,
but it seems like there &apos;s something else bothering her .
you &apos;re a very nice man .
is there anything i can do ?
i think you &apos;re doing it already .
hey , maura .
yes , i @-@ i took your advice , and i wrote down notes
to direct the conversation in a focused way .
really ?
okay , fine . i &apos;ll read them to you .
okay .
baby -- yes .
us married ...
still no .
raising child ...
just me .
his role -- uh ...
i don &apos;t know . something about understanding
and arm wrestling .
i &apos;m kidding .
yeah , no , no . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s gonna go great , don &apos;t you think ?
okay , um ... maura , i got to go .
this is him .
okay .
i hope so , too . thanks .
hey , casey .
so ? how &apos;d it go with casey ?
fine .
can you be a little bit more specific than &quot; fine &quot; ?
i mean , what can i tell you ?
it -- it -- it went fine .
okay . how did he react when you told him you were pregnant ?
he was surprised .
um ... but he understood
that that &apos;s not a reason to get married , so ...
and what about your plans to raise a child on your own ?
we &apos;re gonna figure out his level of involvement
once he &apos;s had a chance to digest all the information .
well , that sounds like it went better than &quot; fine . &quot;
i don &apos;t know what more you could ask for .
yeah . no , you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
so , why aren &apos;t you more relieved ?
because when i was finished dealing with casey ,
the thought of having a baby
just hit me like a freight train .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m scared , maura .
of course you &apos;re scared .
that &apos;s how you &apos;re supposed to feel .
there &apos;s the support i was looking for .
okay , nothing about giving birth or raising children is easy .
you and your brothers caused me a whole bunch of trouble .
but i wouldn &apos;t trade it for a minute !
beuse you &apos;ve been my greatest joy !
and your child will do the same for you .
fear is normal .
keeps us on our toes .
thanks , ma .
what kind of problems could i have possibly caused you ?
don &apos;t get me started .
oh , please -- start .
she threw a football through mr. mac &apos;s front window .
that was tommy .
you made him .
she didn &apos;t come home on prom night .
well , that was a misunderstanding .
okay . she duct @-@ taped frankie to a chair for laughs .
that was funny .
that poor boy still jumps
every time he hears that &quot; chkkkk ! &quot; sound .
you were bad , jane .
she was bad .
i &apos;ve been waiting for you .
did you get a reply to my job application ?
we got an automated response that the job had been filled .
then why are you smiling ?
because i started thinking --
if got an automated response ,
maybe the other guys who applied got the same thing .
i like where this is going .
so i contacted the website and got the e @-@ mail addresses
of the other men who received the same automated response .
you think one of them may have interacted with the killer ?
mm @-@ hmm . one actually met for the job .
and he &apos;s waiting in the interview room right now .
early bird , meet worm .
i answered the ad and , uh , got a reply from this guy -- greg .
we met at a diner for the interview .
did you get his last name ?
no .
what can you tell us about him ?
seemed like a good guy .
we both liked bikes -- bonded over harleys .
what kind of harley you got ?
&apos;77 electra glide .
1,200cc shovelhead . nice ride .
i bet greg liked the bike .
oh , yeah . yeah .
and he was impressed , too , you know ,
that even through all the hard times ,
i found a way to hang on to it .
well , sounds like you two really hit it off .
we did .
well , why didn &apos;t you get the job ?
he , uh , he got pissed when he found out i had a girlfriend .
i hadn &apos;t mentioned that on the application .
what did greg look like ?
white guy , mid @-@ 50s , big -- maybe 6 &apos; 5 , &quot;
long , gray hair pulled back in a ponytail .
where did you meet him ?
bayview diner in southie .
frankie &apos;s looking for us .
okay .
thank you very much , steve .
so , what did this guy do ?
well , let &apos;s just say you &apos;re lucky
this is the one job you didn &apos;t get .
i sent the photo to the local sheriff
where the farm was located .
he remembers the family that owned the place , the danielsons .
according to bankruptcy records ,
the dad , harry , lost it to the bank in 1984 .
you think harry &apos;s our killer ?
no . he &apos;s deceased .
but his son , greg , might be .
description matches .
and greg seems to have dropped off the radar in the late 90s .
that &apos;s about the time the murders began .
jane , you thinking what i &apos;m thinking ?
yeah . it &apos;s never too early for lunch .
yeah , i &apos;ve seen him . but he &apos;s older now .
his hair is gray .
it &apos;s in one of them damn ponytails .
looks ridiculous on an old guy like him .
i know what you mean .
you won &apos;t catch me growing mine out .
is he a regular ?
no . he comes in from time to time .
when &apos;s the last time you saw him ?
i don &apos;t know . couple days ago .
was he with this man ?
yeah . they went out of here laughing .
can you remember anything else about him ?
like , does he ever talk about where he lives ?
no .
what about a car ?
i saw him getting into an old , green pickup across the street .
now , unless you &apos;re ordering the daily special ,
i got to get back to my paying customers .
the victim 18 months ago
owned a 2004 green ford pickup
that &apos;s been missing since the murder .
let &apos;s put a bolo out on that
and let them know the driver &apos;s armed and dangerous .
anything on the bolo ?
nothing .
all right , well , i set up surveillance on the diner
and every large park in the city .
there &apos;s something else i got to tell you .
i &apos;m , um ...
i @-@ i &apos;m -- i &apos;m pregnant .
congratulations .
thank you .
only maura and my family know , so ...
well , thank you for including me .
well , you &apos;re family , vince .
and -- and i want to keep it a secret
until i ... can &apos;t keep it a secret .
i mean , brass finds out , i &apos;ll be riding --
we got a hit on our bolo .
a patrol officer pulled over a green 2004 ford pickup .
we got our guy .
over there .
which way did he go ?
okay . get him an ambulance .
spread out . what happened ?
i hit the lights .
the guy pulls over , bolts from the truck .
i chased him before i realized he had a gun .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
i &apos;ve got an officer down . send me an ambulance asap .
he &apos;s dead .
jane ?
jane !
jane ! jane ! !
hey ! hey , look at me . you okay ?
okay . come on .
all right . okay , okay .
get up . come on , come on .
come on . come on .
get up . come on . get up .
all right , all right .
you &apos;re okay . breathe .
breathe for me .
that &apos;s it . okay .
you okay , you okay ?
thank you .
come here , come here .
all right .
i mean , none of this stuff is worth killing over .
losing the family farm clearly screwed him up .
maybe he felt he was owed something because of it .
yeah , or he was just an asshole .
certainly more concise .
i figured something bad happened .
i just kept hoping that one day ,
he &apos;d walk through my door and everything would be okay .
it was because of your friendship
we were able to find his murderer .
danielson would have killed again . you saved lives .
i just wish i could have saved brooks .
i told him he didn &apos;t have to take that job .
i don &apos;t know why he wouldn &apos;t let me help him .
everybody needs help sometimes .
how are you doing with the shooting ?
i &apos;m okay .
i mean , he made his decision .
i had no choice . i just reacted .
that &apos;s a very healthy attitude .
i &apos;m all about the healthy choices .
so , is that why you decided to join me tonight ?
well , you said it &apos;d be good for me .
as simple as that ?
all right , well , you are going to love it here .
it &apos;s very peaceful , and the staff is very friendly .
remind me again why it &apos;s so good for me .
well , as your pregnancy advances
and you gain more and more weight ,
there &apos;s an increased strain on your legs and your feet .
sounds lovely .
you &apos;ll be fine .
this class is all about building up the muscles
that you &apos;ll need to handle your new body .
jane , those are someone else &apos;s shoes .
my feet are clean .
ooh . they do look fabulous on you .
what ? !
not bad for a pregnant lady , hmm ?
jane , why are you really here ?
because i realized i have to let you help me with this baby .
it &apos;s not easy for you to ask for help .
i can &apos;t do this alone , maura .
nobody can . it takes a village .
and your family and me -- we are happy to be your village .
are those yours ?
no .
then what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
admiring them ?
yeah , this isn &apos;t a shoe store . they don &apos;t belong to you .
she was just ...
trying on other people &apos;s shoes .
who does that ?
i &apos;ll just take them off .
yes , you will .
and you &apos;ll wait right here while i go speak to an instructor .
oh , you &apos;re right . the staff is so friendly .
i am suddenly not feeling like taking a class tonight .
oh , good .
well , why don &apos;t i take my village out for a burger ?
oh . you know what ?
this villager thinks that &apos;s an excellent idea .
just hurry .
you know , burgers can be a little fatty .
okay , fine . i &apos;ll have the turkey burger .
you know , a quinoa burger actually isn &apos;t a bad choice .
don &apos;t push it , maura .
maybe you should have a ... toe burger with your new shoes .
i can &apos;t believe i did that .
w @-@ why didn &apos;t you stand up and stop me or something ?
she scared me .
okay , ready ?
1 , 2 , 3 . kick !
