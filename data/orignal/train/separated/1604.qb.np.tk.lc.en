monte and i broke up because ...
well , she has feelings for somebody else .
are you having an affair with monte ?
no . i did not kiss her . she kissed me .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
judge jeffrey ringer continues to block my adoption .
should she be saying those things ?
i don &apos;t think you should post it .
it &apos;s too late .
what nate said to me was horrible .
because , mom , when someone calls one person the n @-@ word ,
it hurts all of us .
did you call my wife that word ?
not that i recall .
i had sex with someone else when we were still together .
you know about carmen accusing rita of hitting her ?
这样你就可以洗脱罪名了 爱你 凯丽
and i have a recording of carmen admitting that she lied .
carmen knows that i kissed you .
the judge will never let lena and stef adopt me .
it just wasn &apos;t meant to be .
i should probably go back to my room .
no .
i &apos;m afraid mariana &apos;s going to wake up .
she won &apos;t .
that girl sleeps like the dead , you know that .
i wish we could stay here forever .
... and ever and ever .
do you think they know yet ?
they will soon .
if not from my social worker , from rita .
they &apos;re gonna be ... so mad .
and hurt .
i think they &apos;re going to be most upset
that they can &apos;t adopt you .
you okay ?
i got you , don &apos;t i ?
dibs on the first shower .
i tried baseball with connor for a while .
that was ... it was fun . it was cool .
hi , callie . hi , brandon .
hey , rita . good to see you .
so we , uh , we heard from robin .
and she spoke with everyone at girls united .
she &apos;s , um ...
she &apos;s recommending your adoption .
what about that ?
best news ever .
isn &apos;t that great ?
finally , we did it !
finally ! can you believe it ?
no , i can &apos;t .
so happy . so happy .
oh ... come into my office , will you ?
so , did you , um ...
you didn &apos;t listen to the recording i sent you ?
oh , no , i did . i listened to the whole thing .
thanks for sending it . you totally saved my ass .
um , i didn &apos;t like everything that i heard on it .
but listen , it &apos;s over now , right ?
what happened with brooke and carmen ?
well , they &apos;re back in juvie .
and , uh , carmen is not going to be in the army any time soon .
she must &apos;ve been really upset .
yes , she was .
but i told her i believed in her ,
you know , and i forgave her .
and that i know she &apos;s not the kind of person
who wants to just go ruin somebody &apos;s life
because she can ,
especially yours .
you saved me . i save you .
you know why ? because everyone deserves a family .
and this one , kid ...
... that &apos;s yours .
you enjoy it , all right ?
i gotta go home . call me tomorrow .
honey ?
i ...
do you think we should cancel the party ?
i think my parents would understand .
why ? why would we do that ?
because you &apos;re barely speaking to me ,
and i don &apos;t think we &apos;re in a good place right now
to be hosting some big anniversary shindig .
aren &apos;t your parents coming down tonight ?
it &apos;d be a little rude to cancel last minute .
i think they &apos;d understand .
i just ... i want to give us a little time
so that we can work this out ,
we can make this okay .
well , nothing is going to make things okay right now ,
so we might as well suck it up and have a party .
i gotta get this . excuse me .
stef ...
hello ?
stef ? it &apos;s dr. weiss .
yes . hey , how are you ? what &apos;s going on ?
well , i &apos;m looking at the results of your mammogram ,
and they &apos;re inconclusive .
okay .
so we need you to come back in to reimage .
uh , sure . uh , should i be worried ?
let &apos;s not worry until we know
we have something to worry about .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess rita talked to carmen ,
and it kind of just went away , i guess .
i don &apos;t ...
oh , my god . oh , my god .
calm down . calm down for a sec .
everything &apos;s going to be all right .
what ? how is it going to be all right ?
okay , we had sex .
i @-@ i thought ... i thought
the adoption was completely off the table .
i would &apos;ve ... i would &apos;ve never ...
i know . me neither .
what are we going to do ?
well , look who i found hanging around the airport .
oh , hello !
hello , beautiful !
how are you ? how was your trip ?
oh , good .
yeah ? uneventful ?
yes .
good , good .
anybody hungry ? i got leftovers from dinner .
no , we just ate at the airport .
any excuse for pizza .
well , how about some wine ?
oh , well , we wouldn &apos;t say no to that .
i didn &apos;t think so .
thank you both so much for doing this for us .
well , we &apos;re happy to do it .
absolutely .
i mean , my goodness , 40 years .
that is , uh ... that is quite an accomplishment .
it seems like 40 minutes ...
underwater .
oh , hey now ...
you &apos;re so awful .
so , uh , jesus sends his love .
oh , good .
oh , he &apos;s not going to make it ?
no . he &apos;s got his first big wrestling meet .
oh , well , we understand .
but it is a shame . it would be nice
to have the whole family together .
has anyone heard from nate ?
no .
why would you tell jenna that you kissed me ?
you know why we broke up , right ?
i finally told her that the reason
i &apos;m having a hard time falling in love with her
is because i &apos;ve already ...
fallen in love with somebody else .
with you .
yeah , i @-@ i got that .
hey , i know it &apos;s not okay . i know .
you don &apos;t ...
i know you don &apos;t feel the same way about me .
and i promise i would never , ever want to break up a marriage .
i just , uh ...
i guess i needed to say that out loud .
did you ?
uh , sorry for barging in , uh ...
have you got a sec ?
you slept with him ?
girl , what is wrong with you ?
i ... i thought the whole adoption thing wasn &apos;t ...
i was 100 % sure that carmen was going to blow it for me .
so you jump into bed with him the first chance you got ?
we were in a cabin , in the woods . okay ? it just happened .
so what are you going to do ?
tell your moms ? call off the adoption ?
i can &apos;t . it would ... it would destroy them .
i don &apos;t know what i can do , honestly .
it would be so horrible for me to betray them like that
after everything they &apos;ve done for me , i ...
what about brandon ?
what about brandon ?
do you love him ?
i don &apos;t ... know . i can &apos;t love him now ...
i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t deal with this .
listen to me . don &apos;t go getting any big ideas
about running away or taking off or something .
you figure it out .
you decide what you want and then you make it happen .
i want you to know how mortified i am
by what i said ,
what i called your mom .
i remember .
of course i remember .
i &apos;ll never forget the look on your mom &apos;s face after that ...
word came out of my mouth .
and the fact that you had to hear it ,
makes it a hundred times worse .
i wish i could tell you why i said it .
i think i was just so furious with dad .
for leaving me with mom ,
for missing birthdays , for missing every single play i did ,
for missing graduation ,
for ... basically sucking .
anyway ...
i know it &apos;s unforgivable .
but i &apos;m glad i at least had the chance
to tell you how sorry i am .
pretty . what is it ?
oh , it &apos;s , uh ... a diner where we had our first date .
i had a painter friend of ours make it for dana .
i hope she likes it .
she will . trust .
we &apos;ll see .
your grandmother &apos;s pretty particular about her gifts .
but , in any case , it &apos;s going to be a great evening ,
and good food , good friends ,
and your brother even offered to play some music for us .
yeah , mr. fancy @-@ pants , award @-@ winning composer ,
said he and his buddy mat are going to do it as our gift .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . i just ...
i did something pretty awful ...
and ... mat and me broke up . that &apos;s all .
do you love him ? want him back ?
you &apos;re going to have to fight for him .
get him to forgive you .
yeah , that &apos;s pretty unlikely .
sweetheart , nothing you could ever do , no matter how terrible ,
nothing is unforgivable .
i mean , sure he apologized ,
but he basically blamed the whole thing on daddy .
he did ? really ?
well , not the whole thing ,
but ... he might as well have .
lena , nate had a right to be angry with your dad .
as good a father as he was to you , honey ,
he dropped the ball with his son .
so what ? that gives him permission to insult you like that ?
of course not , honey , but , you know ,
ever since we confronted him , i &apos;ve been ... i &apos;ve been thinking about
why this whole thing just
never bothered me the way it bothered you .
the truth of the matter is , honey , i think i &apos;ve always known
that nate was never actually trying to hurt me .
he was trying to hurt his dad ,
by lashing out at the ... the one thing he loved the most .
you . but , uh , does that make it okay , mom ?
no , it doesn &apos;t , but ...
i ... i understand it ,
and i have compassion for this ...
very scared , angry young man .
don &apos;t you , baby ?
sorry . i didn &apos;t realize you were still rehearsing .
but , um ... i have an idea .
i uh , thinking maybe i could sing a song for grams and grandpa ?
do you ... sing ?
yes , i sing .
and i was doing some research and it just so happened
that the number one song the year they got married was
&quot; love will keep us together &quot; by captain and chenille .
or ... something .
sounds great .
um , but it &apos;ll probably sound better with , uh ...
with just piano , so , um ,
i &apos;ll let you guys to it .
do you still want to ... do the song ?
yeah , of course .
are you wearing any lotion or perfumes ?
uh , no , i &apos;m not .
okay , good .
and we &apos;re reimaging the left breast ?
correct .
all right .
drop the shoulder of your gown , step up to the yellow line .
arm up .
it must be some pretty nasty stuff , huh ?
looking at these images all day ,
probably got a pretty good eye , at this point ,
for anything concerning , right ?
yeah . the doctor will call you with your results .
okay . here we go .
stay as still as you can , please .
生日 1974年04月14日
hey , bubba .
jude ?
what happened ?
i , uh ... walked into connor &apos;s room ,
and i found the two of them ,
making out , with their shirts off .
uh , what did you do ?
i told jude that it was time for me to take him home .
okay . so have you , uh ...
have you had the talk with connor yet ?
we weren &apos;t really doing anything .
okay .
so ... i &apos;m not in trouble ?
no .
no , but you &apos;re probably going to wish you were .
i think it &apos;s time we had the talk .
i &apos;m really happy that you found someone as wonderful
and kind as connor .
i really am .
and when sex is shared between two people ...
okay , okay .
connor and i are not having sex .
oh . okay . good .
good , um ...
so ...
when any kind of physical intimacy is shared
between two people who care about each other ...
... it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
okay , look , if i &apos;m being honest ,
i really don &apos;t know a whole lot
about the logistics of two men being together ,
but , uh , i definitely want you to know
how to take care of yourself
and how to be safe for when the time comes .
which hopefully won &apos;t be for ... quite some time .
it won &apos;t . i swear .
okay .
so ...
you know what this is , right ?
a condom .
right .
do you know how it works ?
so , i , um ...
i had a little talk with monte today .
really ?
yep .
she , uh ... she told me that ...
she told me that she &apos;s in love with me .
what did you say ?
i told her i &apos;m in love with my wife .
well , but there &apos;s one thing you didn &apos;t keep to yourself .
really ?
you &apos;re going to hold this against me ...
this one thing that i didn &apos;t tell you ?
because i didn &apos;t want you to feel weird or ...
awkward or whatever .
after the dozens and dozens of secrets you &apos;ve kept from me .
oh , is that what we &apos;re doing , we &apos;re keeping score now ?
really ?
let me ask you this : how does
someone fall in love with someone just like that ?
out of the blue , without any encouragement , lena ?
did it just happen ?
is it something she caught ,
like a virus or a cold ? is it contagious ?
stef , i &apos;m not trying to fight you here .
i &apos;m trying to fight for us .
are you asking me if i liked the attention ?
because , yes , yes , i did .
i liked it .
i &apos;m not saying that i encouraged it ,
but i admit that i didn &apos;t do enough to stop it .
why not ?
why not ? why didn &apos;t you ?
because of me ? i @-@ i suppose it &apos;s my fault
because i didn &apos;t pay enough attention to you , is that it ?
thanks .
well , you know what ? it &apos;s too bad !
it &apos;s too bad ! because between the kids and my work
and my ... and everything else , i cannot always put you
as priority number one !
can we please just get some sleep ?
because we have a very big day tomorrow .
what are you doing ?
i just wanted to see you .
i , um ...
i should &apos;ve said this at the cabin .
i love you .
i love you too .
what if i call robert ? maybe ...
you should probably go back to your room .
but i had no clue , like , what she was planning .
and then she pulled out a condom .
i thought i was going to die .
i mean , for a lesbian ,
she sure knows a lot about how guys have sex .
how was your dad ? did he give you the talk too ?
yeah , we had a talk .
i think i &apos;m going to go live with my mom .
in l.a. ?
but ...
why ?
my dad &apos;s not ... okay .
with us and ... with me .
hi . i &apos;m really glad you &apos;re here .
daddy .
yeah ?
hey , dad .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
i invited him .
i can &apos;t do this tonight .
just ...
daddy .
listen . mom and i each had a conversation with nate .
a really good conversation , and he apologized for everything .
he did ?
i have tried since i fell in love with you to protect you
from as much of the racism and
the bigotry in this world as i possibly could .
oh , my love .
what an impossible task you &apos;ve given yourself .
it &apos;s all right .
we &apos;ve forgiven him .
you can too .
i promise , it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
dad ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
me too .
i want to thank you .
thank you all for being here .
and thank you to my beloved daughter
and her wonderful wife for throwing this shindig
and bringing us all together .
and a special thank you to my son ,
and the lovely faith for making this long journey
to get here and be here with us .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it seems like only yesterday ...
i am so grateful that your mother called him .
he would never have come out here if he hadn &apos;t heard from her .
but mostly , i want to thank my beautiful dana .
i still can &apos;t believe that you agreed to go out with me .
and i still can &apos;t believe
that i get to wake up next to you every day .
i &apos;m a lucky man ...
to be here surrounded by my friends and my entire family .
because let &apos;s face it , family is everything .
and love is everything .
and what more could i have asked for , in this life ,
than to have a moment like this ?
happy anniversary , my love .
happy anniversary !
cheers .
hear ! hear !
happy anniversary !
okay , thank you .
what &apos;s wrong ?
well , i wanted to wait until i knew something for sure ,
but , um , i had to get a second mammogram .
because i guess they saw something in the first one .
why didn &apos;t you tell me this ?
because i didn &apos;t want to worry you , and ...
because i didn &apos;t want to need you .
because i &apos;m mad , i &apos;m really mad .
i &apos;m so ... it was ...
what did they say ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine , love . i &apos;m fine .
thank god . thank god .
oh , thank god .
before we go back out there ,
there are some things that i need to say to you .
and i know ... there are some things you need to say to me .
can we do that , please ?
yeah .
* love *
* love will keep us together *
* think of me babe whenever *
* some sweet @-@ talking girl comes along *
* singing the song *
* don &apos;t mess around , you just gotta be strong *
* just stop , &apos; cause i really love you *
* stop , i &apos;ll be thinkin &apos; of you *
you know , i think that this is pretty much
the exact place that we tied the knot .
yeah , i think you &apos;re right about that .
mm @-@ hmm . i think i am .
and i meant every single word i said that day .
you &apos;re the absolute love of my life ,
lena elizabeth adams foster .
and , uh , nothing will ever , ever , ever , ever change that .
* &apos; cause i really love you *
* stop , i &apos;ll be thinking of you *
* look in my heart and let love *
* keep us together *
pardon me , may i , uh , cut in ?
oh , my girl .
so , faith told me that you called nate .
well ...
you know , you never cease to amaze me .
i think that is the very best anniversary present
you could &apos;ve ever given , daddy .
you remember when i said that you used to be my hero ?
you still are .
* and i &apos;ll need you then *
* just stop , &apos; cause i really love you *
* stop , i &apos;ll be thinking of you *
* look in my heart and let love *
* keep us together *
thank you .
we could &apos;ve ruined everything .
but we didn &apos;t .
we didn &apos;t even break any rules .
think about it .
technically , we weren &apos;t even fostering
when you came to idyllwild .
you were staying at g.u.
and the thought of adoption wasn &apos;t even a possibility .
yes , but it ...
we didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
you don &apos;t think so ?
we can &apos;t ...
we can &apos;t ever tell anyone .
i know .
we won &apos;t .
it &apos;s going to be okay , callie .
this is your family .
that &apos;s all that matters .
come in .
hey . thanks .
is connor ready yet ?
yeah , he &apos;s , um , just getting his jacket .
can i ask you a question ?
yeah .
why are you sending connor away ?
i @-@ i &apos;m not .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t .
look , i &apos;m trying here , okay ?
i &apos;m doing the best that i can .
connor asked to go live with his mom .
ready ?
yeah .
see you tomorrow , right ?
see ya .
look , i know i made a mistake ,
a huge one , and if you can &apos;t get over it , then that &apos;s fine .
i have to live with that , but ...
i &apos;m not going to beg and grovel anymore .
i &apos;m not going to beg you to forgive me &apos; cause ...
i forgive me .
okay .
okay ?
does that ... mean you &apos;re willing
to try to get back together ?
no .
but i &apos;m glad you stopped beating yourself up about it .
good night .
um , so , firstly , i want to say , um ...
i &apos;ve been really overwhelmed by all your messages .
if i &apos;ve inspired you in any way ,
it just makes it all worth it .
so ...
so i am getting adopted tomorrow .
i ... i can &apos;t even believe it &apos;s finally going to happen .
you guys have no idea what a ride it &apos;s been .
i &apos;m just really happy .
i do want you to know that it doesn &apos;t mean
that i &apos;m ... leaving you .
i &apos;ll always be a foster kid .
yeah , thanks for listening .
hi , you guys .
thank you for coming .
excuse me . i ... i need to talk to you .
oh , yeah . uh , lena ? lena , honey ?
the judge saw some website of callie &apos;s
fost and something , and he didn &apos;t like it , at all .
why @-@ why wouldn &apos;t he like it ?
apparently , there &apos;s a video where you talk about him .
so , the first thing we need to do
when we get into that courtroom ,
we have to apologize , you need to apologize .
do you understand me ?
apologize for what ?
for insulting judge ringer in that video you posted .
i didn &apos;t insult him . i was just telling the truth .
i &apos;m not ... i &apos;m not going to apologize for that .
callie , think about this , please .
this might not be the moment for you to ...
what ? stand up for what i believe in ?
i love you both , with all of my heart ,
and you know how much i want to be a part of this family ,
but i can &apos;t take back what i said .
i mean , there &apos;s too many people counting on me . i can &apos;t .
so , do you understand what this means ?
she &apos;s here .
there she is .
what is going on ?
they &apos;re foster kids . they &apos;re here to support callie .
all right , everyone , thank you . that &apos;s enough .
well , callie , welcome back .
i wish i could say i was entirely happy to see you .
unfortunately , i was sent a video
which i found somewhat upsetting ,
and , quite frankly , a little insulting .
i didn &apos;t mean to offend you , sir .
really ?
you , uh , called me out by name .
you said i was making these decisions about your life
without any consideration of what you wanted .
because that &apos;s how it felt .
the system is broken , sir , badly .
and the only people who really understand just how bad
are the ones without any say , without any voice .
somebody has got to speak up .
and that someone is going to be you , is it ?
yes . i &apos;m one of the lucky ones .
you know , i ... found an amazing family ,
and i &apos;m finally safe and loved ,
like , really , truly loved .
and one of the things i &apos;ve learned from my moms ,
from watching the way they &apos;ve lived their lives ,
is that when you &apos;re lucky ,
it is your job to give something back .
and when you see something wrong ,
to stand up and to say so .
so , i &apos;m really sorry if i offended you .
it was not my intention .
i &apos;m not going to apologize for standing up .
somebody has to .
well , i wish it weren &apos;t the case ...
but there &apos;s a lot of truth in what you &apos;re saying .
it &apos;s no secret the system is failing a lot of kids ,
and that someone needs to do something about it .
i &apos;m proud of you for being that person .
quiet , please .
quiet , please .
now , your social worker has done a thorough investigation
of the restraining order against brandon foster
and tells me there is no reason to believe
there &apos;s anything here to prevent your adoption .
is that correct ?
there &apos;s nothing romantic
going on with you and brandon any longer ?
no , your honor , that &apos;s over .
well , then i see no reason not to make it official .
congratulations , callie .
you &apos;re officially a member of the adams foster family .
one of the happiest days of my life .
hey , bro . i &apos;ve been thinking .
maybe ... maybe you should go live with your mom .
at first , when your dad said
that you asked him to let you go ,
i didn &apos;t get it ...
at all , but ...
i was watching you in there when callie was talking
about how great it is to finally be ...
you know , happy and safe ,
and to have a family that is really , truly there for her .
and i want you to have that .
because ...
i love you .
i love you too .
l.a. isn &apos;t that far , right ?
i mean , there are trains .
hey , moms , can you come in here for a sec ?
there &apos;s someone here to see you .
what ? who &apos;s here ?
surprise .
jesus !
oh , my god ! look at you !
you got so tall . what is going on ?
what are they feeding you over there ?
i thought you were at some big wrestling thing or something .
that was just a cover so i could surprise you .
i was trying to get here in time for callie &apos;s adoption ,
but my flight got delayed .
i didn &apos;t want to miss this ,
and our first night together as a family .
right ? we &apos;re all together !
is there any food ?
oh , my goodness .
i &apos;m starving .
what a surprise . of course .
let &apos;s make some dinner for jesus .
okay . we need some music .
aw , i &apos;m so happy you &apos;re here .
i don &apos;t want you to go back .
yeah . i , um ... i can &apos;t go back .
all right , you guys . enough of the reunion .
let &apos;s go . mariana , set the table , please .
jesus , how about you grab a sharp knife
and start chopping vegetables we can use for a salad ?
