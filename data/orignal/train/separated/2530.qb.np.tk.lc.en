第二十六季第十三集
今日召开镇民会议
and i regret to inform you that our soviet sister city ,
springograd , has disappeared from the map .
now , i &apos;d like to welcome our beloved four @-@ time mayor ,
hans moleman !
springfielders , rejoice .
what is the one thing our blessed little town has lacked ?
a human zoo ?
what we lack is a town anthem .
and you &apos;re in luck , because i have written one .
mr. largo , if you please .
* there &apos;s a special little place *
* a special smile on every face *
* a town called springfield *
* special buildings , special sky *
* a unique place to live and die *
* only springfield *
* of all the cities on the mappy *
* you &apos;re the one that makes me happy *
* only springfield , only springfield *
stop the anthem !
what is it , moe ?
i was in tuscaloosa on vacation .
started out great .
they got a joint there called moe &apos;s original barbeque .
but then i heard their city anthem !
give a listen !
* of all the cities on the mappy *
* you &apos;re the one that makes me happy *
* only tuscaloosa , only tuscaloosa *
that &apos;s our song .
they just changed &quot; springfield &quot; to &quot; tuscaloosa . &quot;
guns are for celebrating .
what do you do with them when you &apos;re angry ?
now , calm down .
this could just be an amazing musical coincidence .
there ain &apos;t no coincidences in popular songs , bony .
* only austin * * only oakland *
* only calgary * * only provo *
* only ulan bator *

only in area 51
we &apos;ve been singing this song like it only belonged to us ,
when every city in america &apos;s had its lips on it !
even des moines .
wait a minute .
this song was supposedly written by former mayor moleman !
oh , i didn &apos;t write it .
i bought it from a salesman
who was selling it to half the towns in america .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d find out ,
because i never thought any of us would ever go anywhere .
well , then what do i do with this ? !
now i can &apos;t be buried in a jewish cemetery !
please be merciful .
boy , sure is nice
not to be the one on the horse for a change .
as mayor , i balanced the budget eight times !
i still believe in this town--
a town that deserves its own original song .
and as an aspiring musician with off @-@ broadway dreams ,
i &apos;m the one to write it .
so ordered .
i &apos;ll write that song .
pharrell williams ? !
i &apos;m sorry , everyone ,
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old girl got there first .
i understand .
it might seem crazy what i &apos;m about to say
sunshine , she &apos;s here , you can take a break
shelbyville rules !
springfield drools ... !
let &apos;s see .
what rhymes with &quot; jebediah &quot; ?
&quot; tire fire &quot; ?
how about &quot; patty and selma &quot; ? &quot; fatty and smell ya . &quot;
&quot; mr. teeny &quot; ? &quot; sister wienie . &quot;
you &apos;ve got a gift !
well , don &apos;t be so surprised .
i did write that &quot; lisa , it &apos;s your birthday &quot; song .
yeah , with that mental patient
who thought he was michael jackson .
whoa . thinking back , i &apos;m kind of surprised
mom and dad let a crazy man spend all night in my bedroom .
simpler time .
bart , i need your help to write a new anthem for springfield .
will you team up with me ?
hmm . what &apos;s in it for me ?
uh , i &apos;ll make brownies later .
whoa , that is the best deal any songwriter ever got .
and that &apos;s true even if i don &apos;t get the brownies .
i &apos;m in !
i think we might just make a good team ,
like maggie and granpa .
伯老鬼在那里被枪杀
what are you doing ?
what &apos;s it look like ? writing a song .
artists .
we did it ! we wrote an awesome song !
we make a great brother and sister team ,
like andy and lana wachowski .
should we hug ?
mm , how about a fist bump through a towel ?
that works .
排两小时队 听五分钟曲儿
i saved us seats .
oh , thank you , homie .
thank you , roll of masking tape .
uh , gonna be a tight fit .
* springfield &apos;s the only home that we &apos;ve got *
* but to be frank , there &apos;s not a lot to recommend it *
* we &apos;ve got a big sinkhole *
地陷吞噬小型全明星赛
* and they shut down the think hole *
图书馆被拆除
* hashtag : springfieldpride has never ever trended *
# 春田镇的骄傲
this is not boosterism !
warm up the horse .
* but when you think of the things we lack *
* stead of the stuff we &apos;ve got *
* why springfield *
* why not *
* we &apos;ve only had a hurricane once *
* we haven &apos;t had a circus fire in months *
* springfield , why not *
* ooh , we &apos;re just off the interstate *
* the second right off exit 8 *
he didn &apos;t blow his line .
sarah , let &apos;s have another !
* you may find our culture lacking *
* we finally outlawed our snake whacking *
* sure , cops are easily bought *
* and our dentists are all self @-@ taught *
* but hooray for springfield *
* give two cheers . smallpox @-@ free for seven years *
* why springfield ? why not *
what a song !
i feel as if i &apos;m in the lobby of the brill building !
homer , it &apos;s a standing ovation . get up .
our kids just did something amazing .
well , not maggie .
get up !
okay , okay .
standing &quot; o &quot; or die !
stop laughing at me !
occupied .
stop fearing me !
damn it !
please keep spinning it .
i don &apos;t want to look at it .
can &apos;t you say something to make me feel better ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m tired of you saying planes have gotten smaller
and two presidents were fatter than you , and ...
fine , i got it .
starting right now , a yearlong juice cleanse .
every morning , i get a colonic ,
and i sleep in a sauna every night .
oh , that &apos;s not a healthy way to lose weight .
it &apos;s not about health , marge , it &apos;s about going crazy .
you don &apos;t have to do this alone .
拒绝再当身材臃肿的美国人
what the ... ?

this is it .
my name is roy ,
and this week i gained seven pounds .
yes !
no shame there !
you go , girth !
huh ? oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i thought you were over @-@ feeders anonymous .
no , no . in fact , quite the opposite .
we are big is beautiful .
so you guys are proud of what you are ?
we do not cower in the shadows , we make the shadows .
do you guys serve snacks ?
we &apos;ve got ice cream hoagies ,
deep @-@ fried sugar bags , dorsnickos , snickeritos ,
milky snicks , porksicles , and of course diet soda .
oh , got to have diet soda .
oh , yeah , of course .
yes , mustn &apos;t forget the diet soda .
i have so many questions for you .
first of all , is this floor reinforced ?
you know , maybe i shouldn &apos;t be here .
i promised my wife i &apos;d lose weight .
if i may .
拐棍 饮料放大镜 甜甜圈定位器 腰带延长器
ooh , labelled .
our loved ones , though precious , can often be a hurdle .
who are you ?
i &apos;m the founder of our little group , albert .
ooh , like fat albert !
we never use the word &quot; fat &quot; here .
sorry .
my dear fat friend ,
all your wife needs is a little education .
now repeat after me .
i am big .
i am big .
i am beautiful .
i have a beauty of a sort to some .
no one can make me feel bad about who i am
because this is who i am !
ditto !
you know , i &apos;ve always wanted to blindly follow somebody ,
and i think you just might be the guy .
marge , kids ,
tonight was a turning point in my life .
well , that &apos;s great , homie ,
just let me finish uploading this photo .
no , marge ,
you have to listen !
that place you sent me to changed my life .
thank you , lord !
and i &apos;ll give up online scrapbooking ,
like i promised .
they taught me that i don &apos;t need to lose weight .
i should just be proud of what i am .
what ?
restore , restore !
i met a guy ,
a wonderful guy .
oh , lord .
it &apos;s not what you think .
his name is albert ,
and he taught me not to buy into the lies
taught by big nutrition .
that &apos;s worse than what i thought .
marge , you &apos;re my wife of ten years and i love you ,
but i must observe the teachings of this man
i just met tonight .
now , the first thing i have to do is make amends .
with the bathroom scale .
i &apos;m so sorry i threw you across the room
and called you a liar .
when you told me i was 260 pounds ,
you were just encouraging me .
it was a poem you were writing about my potential .
i &apos;m gonna start celebrating my size ,
and i need you with me as a partner .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i need to talk to the broken porch swing .
so , from now on ,
you guys can no longer say these hateful words :
&quot; chubby , chunky , blobbo , slobbo ,
&quot; fat bastard , michelin man , stay puft , chumbawumba ,
&quot; it is balloon !

by which i mean , &quot; bad , bad ! &quot;
you know , as long as we &apos;re opening this up
and i &apos;m glad you are--
i want to tell you guys that when you call me a gargoyle ,
a troll or a homunculus , it kind of hurts my feelings .
what ? you &apos;re kidding .
we never dreamed .
who knew goblins had feelings ?
you see ? that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about . because ...
we &apos;re big ! we &apos;re proud !
two of us can make a crowd !
sorry , fellas . there &apos;s a movement i have to join .
i &apos;ve learned there &apos;s something more important than drinking :
eating .
thank you for the easy financing !
what the ... ? !
your store is forcing unattainable body images
on our young people .
i say , end the thinsanity !
you , my friend , are wrong .
every girl should look like a sexy praying mantis from milan
whose hips are narrower
than an italian parliamentary majority .
okay , people , show &apos;s over .
nothing to eat here .
now move along .
if you can .
if not , we &apos;re gonna have to take you in .
clancy , what are you doing ?
you &apos;re one of us !
you &apos;re right .
take me in , lou .
hey ! why ?
ah , geez , lou .
you seem to be enjoying this .
just doing my job , chief .
oh , that &apos;s some nice tase work , lou .
homer simpson ?
right here !
excuse me . pardon me .
coming through .
coming back . excuse me .
pardon me . there we go .
uh , coming up .
what can i do for you ?
you &apos;re free on bail .
people , give thanks to that woman ,
standing up for all of us , even though she &apos;s a lighty .
thank you .
although , i think the worst thing
that ever happened to my husband was joining your group .
i &apos;ll handle this .
what is the point of a long life if it &apos;s not enjoyed ?
homer , you have to choose ,
and i think the choice is clear .
guys , i &apos;m coming back in !
suck in your guts .
home .
who &apos;s he giving a piggyback ride to ?
we don &apos;t know .
mom , what &apos;s wrong ?
how come dad &apos;s not with you ?
are they setting bail by the pound ?
he chose to spend the night in a jail with strangers
instead of me .
mom , lisa and i learned
that we can solve any problem through song .
lisa , let &apos;s go write something that &apos;ll change dad &apos;s mind .
do you really think
that we can write a song that does that ?
i just wanted to get out of the room .
she was really bumming me out .
ah , geez .
i thought writing another hit song would be easier .
well , it would &apos;ve helped if you hadn &apos;t crumpled up all the paper
before we wrote anything on it .
这场革命不会上电视转播
no more judgment !
no more jokes !
we will not be made to feel less than
because we are greater than !
i was distinctly promised no math !
homer , i want to say something extremely important
the way a woman does-- subtly , through someone else .
kids ...
take it , bart !
you take it !
i gave it to you !
i refuse to accept it !
just start the song !
we couldn &apos;t write a song .
we &apos;re one @-@ hit wonders .
but is that such a crime ?
look at j.d. salinger .
franny and zooey .
rubik &apos;s cube !
rubik &apos;s snake !
charles m. schulz .
you &apos;ve got me there .
it &apos;s her fault .
she was sucking all the gangsta out of everything .
well , you &apos;re the only &quot; gangsta &quot; i know
at the 9 : 00 bedtime .
9 : 30 , starting in summer . mom said .
ah , kids , stop arguing .
or keep arguing .
i don &apos;t care .
homer , i &apos;m sorry i tried to help you control your weight .
i &apos;m not sure of anything anymore .
sorry i ever opened my mouth .
marge , it &apos;s not your fault
that you can &apos;t win against a superior being like albert .
but , marge , i don &apos;t want you
to ever stop caring about me .
how can you follow a leader
who won &apos;t even get up out of his chair ?
marge , i believe you &apos;re forgetting
america &apos;s greatest wartime wheelchair @-@ bound leader :
professor x of the x @-@ men .
it &apos;s not that professor x wouldn &apos;t get up ,
it &apos;s that he couldn &apos;t !
well , i &apos;ll show you who can get up !
that &apos;s right !
i don &apos;t need this scooter !
all of you ,
follow me to the future !
oh , dear god .
stick a forklift in him , he &apos;s dead .
殡仪馆
i &apos;ve never written a eulogy before ,
but this time , i did .
unfortunately , i left it at home .
thanks , lady .
what albert taught us is that all people have pride
and no group should ever be insulted .
he knew what was important
was how you lived your life every day .
till he was taken from us too soon ,
at the age of ...
twenty @-@ three ? !
people , for god &apos;s sake , join a gym !
kumiko , would you still love me if i lost weight ?
much more !
marge , i &apos;m sorry i was proud of myself .
that &apos;s not really what i was ...
it will never happen again !
now come on . let &apos;s walk home .
absolutely .
can i ask you something ?
what is it that keeps you with me ?
it &apos;s because everything you love ,
you love so much .
because you love me ,
i will not stop yo @-@ yo dieting till i get it right .
at last .
well done , dad .
you finally reached emotional maturity .
unlike bart.
bart &apos;s very mature .
take it from the little boy in his tummy .
now , when do i get to be the head again ?
soon .
it &apos;s always &quot; soon . &quot;
oh . i wish i had said that earlier .
