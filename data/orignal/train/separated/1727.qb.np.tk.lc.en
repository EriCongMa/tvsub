第七季 第五集
awkward silence .
sheldon on his phone .
no touching .
somebody &apos;s having date night .
it &apos;s actually steamier than it looks .
sheldon &apos;s looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables
in renaissance paintings .
oh , no , i got bored with that .
i &apos;m just browsing cuticle scissors on amazon .
how do you not tear off his clothes
and take him right here on this table ?
if you do that , i &apos;ll scream .
sheldon , i have some exciting news to tell you .
that makes two of us .
my new cuticle scissors will be here
in one to two business days .
come on , one .
i &apos;ve been invited to consult on an experiment
at your university for a few months .
isn &apos;t that great ?
we could have lunch together .
we could carpool .
you know , riding with leonard
has gotten a little tedious lately .
th @-@ the only car game he ever wants to play
is the quiet game .
and he &apos;s terrible at it .
i always win .
so , you &apos;re okay with this ?
well , why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
well , this project would have us working
in close proximity to one another .
and there &apos;s the vulgar adage
that one should not defecate where one eats .
my father used to say that all the time .
that and , um , &quot; who does one have to orally gratify
to get a drink around here ? &quot;
but what does that have to do
with you working at the university ?
sheldon , &quot; don &apos;t defecate where you eat , &quot;
means don &apos;t have a romantic relationship in the workplace .
really ?
yes .
yeah , i always took it literally .
that &apos;s why i have never once moved my bowels
in this or any restaurant .
i &apos;m relieved that you don &apos;t have a problem
with us working together .
not as relieved as i &apos;m about to be .
it &apos;s a brave new world , little lady .
are you crazy ?
you don &apos;t want your girlfriend at work with you .
hell clam .
why not ?
hairy fairy .
i think it could be romantic .
you know , my parents met at his place of work .
your father &apos;s a gynecologist .
i know .
what started as a pap smear turned into a date .
which turned into her working there ,
which turned into marriage , which then turned into hatred ,
which continues to this day .
two @-@ eyed cyclops .
would you please tell him this isn &apos;t a good idea ?
no , no , i think it &apos;ll be great .
maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work ,
she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes .
giant baby .
that &apos;s a raging ogre .
yeah , i know .
i &apos;m just saying , i &apos;d never want to work with bernadette .
can you imagine seeing someone all day long
and then you &apos;re supposed to hang out with them after work , too ?
hold on . we do that all the time .
you and i work together and play together .
i know , and it drove me into the arms of another woman .
bipolar bear .
well , i appreciate your concern ,
but i won &apos;t be seeing any more of amy than i already do .
i assume we &apos;ll deduct any extra time we spend together
at work from our weekly quota .
please let me be there when you tell her that .
why ? so you can see the look on amy &apos;s face
when she hears my top @-@ notch idea ?
please , oh , please , just let me be there .
so , amy , what are you gonna be working on at caltech ?
i &apos;m leading a study to see
if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme
leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys .
if they &apos;re anything like humans , the answer &apos;s yes .
wait , you &apos;ve @-@ you &apos;ve done this experiment on humans ?
you mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose ?
no , that would be unethical .
you know , not a lot of people know this ,
but the monoamine oxidase enzyme
was discovered by a woman , mary bernheim .
that &apos;s right .
my phone is just as smart as you guys .
amy , bernadette , penny .
amy , bernadette , penny .
amy , bernadette , penny .
he &apos;s never gonna stop doing that , is he ?
i don &apos;t mind .
i &apos;m hoping to put his love of repetition
to good use someday .
hi . um ...
i &apos;ve reconsidered .
uh , you can &apos;t work where i work .
enjoy the rest of your evening .
sheldon .
i @-@ i already signed the contract .
i cashed a check .
you are not going to come out of this looking good .
sheldon , i don &apos;t understand .
i thought you said you were fine with it .
well , i was .
but that was before howard explained to me
how awful it would be if he had to work
with his significant other .
he said what ?
now , don &apos;t be insulted .
he just thinks too much of you
would be mind @-@ numbingly tedious .
excuse me , i need to have a chat with my husband .
yeah , well , now , well ... keep it short .
fr @-@ from what i gather , brevity is your friend .
so , are we good here ?
no , we &apos;re not good here .
i am working on this project .
yeah , and you can &apos;t tell her what she can and cannot do .
last week , you told leonard he couldn &apos;t wear
his wookiee jacket out in public .
that &apos;s different .
i &apos;m not going to the mall with
someone dressed dumb space bear .
sheldon , you don &apos;t have to worry about me bothering you .
i &apos;ll be in a different building .
and we don &apos;t even have to have lunch together .
really ?
yes .
before all things , i &apos;m a scientist .
i &apos;m just there to do my work and , with a little luck ,
scare the living crap out of some monkeys .
you sure your mothlike personality won &apos;t be drawn
to this blazing fire that is myself ?
more and more sure .
well , then , you have my permission .
i didn &apos;t ask for your permission .
too late . no backsies .
no , no , listen to me . sheldon misunderstood .
what i meant was ,
if we worked together ,
there &apos;d be too much of me for you ,
not the other way around .
howard , if you &apos;re going to lie to your wife ,
don &apos;t start the sentence with &quot; sheldon misunderstood . &quot;
that &apos;s a dead giveaway .
well ?
okay , fine .
i did say that , and i think it &apos;s true .
i think if we worked together and lived together ,
we &apos;d get sick of each other .
yeah , but to be fair , he only said the part
about him getting sick of you .
for the love of god , why ? !
what exactly do you think you &apos;d get sick of ?
his only options here are to fake a heart attack
or have a real one .
it @-@ it &apos;s nothing in particular . i ...
is it my voice ? am i too bossy ?
my arm is feeling numb .
nailed it .
that &apos;s the wrong arm for a heart attack , doofus .
my point is , i &apos;m sure there are things about me
that would drive you crazy if you had to deal
with them all day long .
like looking me in the eye and lying to me ?
oh , well , come on , i just ...
where am i supposed to look when i lie to you ?
find somewhere else to sleep tonight .
oh , bernie ...
if it makes you feel any better ,
amy and i are fine .
i mean , really good .
so , boys , how was the pajama party ?
you guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes ?
it wasn &apos;t a pajama party .
it was just a couple of bros hanging out , giggling ,
eating cookie dough and watching princess bride .
please , stop talking .
as you wish .
i mean , you know , sheldon , none of this would &apos;ve happened
if i hadn &apos;t tried to help you .
uh , it also wouldn &apos;t have happened
if , in the early universe ,
hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common .
这些轻元素才转化为如今宇宙中存在的所有其他重元素
this is fun . your turn .
gentlemen .
hey , amy .
hello .
that was kind of icy .
you two okay ?
oh , we &apos;re fine .
as howard advised ,
she &apos;s merely respecting our professional boundaries .
smart .
take relationship advice from a man
who spent last night braiding raj &apos;s hair .
yeah , you make a good point .
it would appear i was worried for nothing .
look at her , desperately wishing
she was over here at the cool table .
don &apos;t worry , little moth .
the flame will come to you .
on the off chance that
bernadette doesn &apos;t call back and apologize ,
how do you feel about mexican food for dinner tonight ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know . sounds kind of heavy .
that &apos;s &apos; cause you always fill up on chips .
and this is dr. gunderson from stockholm .
ah , sweden .
yeah , home of my favorite muppet
and , uh , second favorite meatball .
okay , the nordic reputation for lack of humor is well @-@ founded .
boy , is his name gunderson or no @-@ funderson ?
where are we going with this , dr. cooper ?
oh , please , i &apos;m your boyfriend .
you call me sheldon .
that &apos;s right , i am in a boy @-@ girl relationship
with this cute little lump of wool .
sheldon ...
it &apos;s a physical relationship , too .
hand @-@ holding , hugging ... even on hot days .
okay , here &apos;s a new one .
apparently now we kick each other
in the shin under the table .
how do you like it when i do it to you ?
not so much , huh ?
test subject d7,
aka betsy , fear response study .
image number one :
frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes .
no visible reaction .
image number two : sousaphone .
still no reaction .
okay .
let &apos;s kick things up a notch .
image number three :
crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys .
okay , now we &apos;re talking .
dr. fowler ?
what do you want , sheldon ?
well , i &apos;m done with work , so ...
oh , sorry , sorry , sorry .
sorry . uh ...
better ?
oh , baguettes .
yes , i like baguettes .
what exactly are you doing ?
determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys
by measuring their response to visual stimuli .
so , goofing off .
as i was saying ,
i &apos;m done with work and leonard &apos;s not .
so good news , you get to take me home .
play your cards right ,
i &apos;ll let you drive me past the lot
where the buses park at night .
i can &apos;t leave now , sheldon .
i &apos;m very busy .
besides , why would i want to do you a favor
after the way you treated me in the cafeteria ?
image number four : boa constrictor .
what on earth are you talking about ?
my behavior in the cafeteria was delightful .
maybe your friend gunderson needs
to head over to ikea and assemble a sense of humor .
you embarrassed me in front of my colleagues
on my first day here .
image number five :
kitten in a teacup .
oh ... embarrassed you ?
you know what ?
i don &apos;t have time for this . find another way home .
i &apos;m starting to get the sense that you &apos;re angry with me .
really ? what tipped you off ?
couple things , actually .
your tone of voice , your body language ...
get out .
well , now , that .
image number six : woman giving birth .
it &apos;s 9 : 00 . where you been ?
oh , i had to take the bus home .
fell asleep and missed my stop .
oh , no .
did you know that los angeles has a little sri lanka ?
i did not .
well , i do ... now .
they &apos;re a lovely people .
although terrifying when you wake up face @-@ to @-@ face with them .
if you &apos;re hungry , i brought home
some mutton and coconut milk .
why &apos;d you get that ? you hate lamb .
i was asking for directions .
apparently , there was a communication problem .
i thought amy was gonna drive you home .
yeah , i thought so , too ,
but she &apos;s acting very strangely .
i was discussing it with a sri lankan fellow on the bus ,
and he hypothesized that a tiger may have
recently run across her shadow .
although he may have just been trying to drum up business
for his brother @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s witch doctor practice .
okay , sheldon , what happened between you and amy ?
well , can you believe she said i embarrassed her ?
yeah .
but you didn &apos;t even hear the details .
sheldon ...
i &apos;ve known you a long time ,
and i &apos;m going to tell you this
with all the love i can possibly muster .
amy &apos;s right . you &apos;re wrong .
but you don &apos;t even know ...
doesn &apos;t matter .
but , now , but in my defense ...
doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;re not listening to my side of it .
okay , fine , sheldon . what is your side ?
well ...
nope , got to go with amy on this one .
shrimp was spicy .
you want a tums ?
you got the tropical fruit kind ?
no , if i buy those ,
i just go through them like candy .
tell me about it .
one time , i swear i pooped out a stick of chalk .
i &apos;ll get it .
thanks .
hi .
oh , hi .
i may have overreacted .
yeah , well , i didn &apos;t handle it so great , either .
it &apos;s just sometimes i feel like you enjoy spending time
with your friends more than with me .
that &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s not ?
you spend all day together at work ,
and then you all hang out at night playing games ,
going to the comic book store .
last week , you two got a couples massage .
so , when you said you wouldn &apos;t want to spend
that much time with me , it really hurt my feelings .
yeah , no , i get that .
i &apos;m so sorry .
starting tomorrow , i am turning over a new leaf .
time with you is my number one priority .
why tomorrow ?
well , we &apos;re real close to finishing off the new batman game .
it is awesome .
uh , you should probably go after her .
should i go after you ?
no !
thanks for getting me in trouble .
amy .
amy .
amy .
sheldon , what are you doing here so late ?
i couldn &apos;t sleep because i kept thinking
about what happened earlier between us .
also , i had one heck of a bus nap .
oh , speaking of which ,
do you want some mutton and coconut milk ?
no .
well , i cannot give this stuff away .
what do you want ?
amy , this isn &apos;t easy to say .
all relationships are difficult ,
but even more so when you &apos;re in one
with a person who struggles
with everyday social interactions .
and frankly ...
who can strike some people
as being kind of a weirdo .
sheldon ...
you &apos;re not a weirdo .
i wasn &apos;t speaking about me .
i mean , honestly ,
there &apos;s no telling what will set you off .
you know , introducing myself as your boyfriend .
giving you the opportunity to drive me home .
breaking the ice with your colleagues
using ethnic humor ,
the funniest kind of humor .
what &apos;s your point ?
my point is , we &apos;re a couple .
and ...
i like you for who you are .
quirks and all .
i like you , too .
well , i should hope so .
i don &apos;t see anyone else banging on this door
to put up with your nonsense .
not even a good @-@ bye ?
you see , that &apos;s the kind of thing
that makes people think you &apos;re weird .
poor kid .
she just doesn &apos;t see it .
i &apos;m not apologizing to howard .
he can come beg me on his knees .
sheldon , too .
if i see him at work , i &apos;m just going to ignore him .
all right , don &apos;t worry . i talked to leonard .
he is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight .
laser &apos;s warmed up .
pull !
