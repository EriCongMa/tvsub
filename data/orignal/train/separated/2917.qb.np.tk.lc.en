hey , beautiful .
hello , handsome .
oh , god .
look at you two . when did you guys meet ?
two weeks ago .
that &apos;s it ?
i know . it sounds crazy , and i &apos;m not impulsive , but ..
we have so much in common .
oh , really ?
we &apos;re both teachers .
and we were both in the peace corps .
peace corps , really ?
when we were building in uruguay , we were two towns apart and never met .
yeah . it wasn &apos;t a town when i got there , but it was a town when i left .
shall we get me really drunk ?
sure .
howdy , doodie .
that &apos;s funny , yeah .
you &apos;re the funniest man here in a bunny costume his wife made him wear .
relax , man . you &apos;re looking a little flushed .
our question might get answered .
what question ?
who could kick whose ass in a fight , you or ross ?
there &apos;s no question .
so you think ross too ?
you picked ross ?
ross is strong .
he &apos;s the strongest out of all three of you . except for joey .
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t pick me .
she &apos;s right . i am stronger .
i would destroy you .
really ? you think you &apos;re stronger ? why don &apos;t you prove it ?
i &apos;ll prove it like a theorem !
all right ! stop it !
stop ! no one &apos;s gonna fight .
people came to see a fight , let &apos;s give them one !
you guys could arm @-@ wrestle .
listen to the slutty nurse .
you &apos;re going down .
oh , yeah ? you &apos;re going downtown !
seriously , guys , the trash talk is embarrassing .
gunther , you brought candy . thank you so much .
you are so sweet .
really ?
you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world .
got to go .
trick or treat .
hi ! wow ! there you go .
my friend lewis told me you were giving out money .
we were , but now we &apos;ve got candy .
i &apos;d rather have the money .
that &apos;s not your choice . happy halloween !
this isn &apos;t fair .
is it fair that you put on a cape and get stuff ?
shut up !
you shut up !
you can &apos;t tell me to shut up .
i think i just did .
and here it comes again . shut up !
no , i got it . i &apos;m good . i got it .
wait , i had one more thing to say . right . shut up .
you &apos;re a mean old woman .
wait ! shut .. don &apos;t cry !
let me get my checkbook !
you don &apos;t have to do this . the strength inside you means the most .
you &apos;re loyal , you &apos;re honest and you have integrity .
that &apos;s the strength i want in a man .
that means nothing to me . come on !
hi , liar .
hey .
he &apos;s marrying you because he thinks the things you were saying were true .
they could be true .
but they &apos;re not .
it &apos;s a fine line .
why are you lying ?
i don &apos;t know .
he did this stuff , i said i did it too . he got so excited , it was fun .
you can &apos;t do this . you &apos;re gonna ruin his life .
why are you taking this so seriously ? it &apos;s just a marriage .
besides , if i cheat on him , i can call it an affair .
honey ?
it &apos;s a disgusting habit , and i want you to quit now !
she &apos;s helped so many people quit .
we &apos;d better get going .
you have a church group meeting .
right .
it was nice meeting you .
you too .
and , ursula , it was really nice meeting you tonight !
come on ! bunny versus doodie . we &apos;re waiting !
okay , guys . one match , winner take all .
wait . what does the winner get ?
pride .
and dignity .
okay , if you say so .
all right , ready , set , go !
come on !
come on !
wow , they &apos;re both really strong .
or equally weak .
oh , god . chandler &apos;s making his sex face .
so you getting tired ?
no . i could do this all day .
yeah . me too .
getting a little tired , though .
god , i &apos;m exhausted .
this is starting to look bad for me , okay ? mona &apos;s standing right there .
she &apos;s talking to joey ! you gotta let me win !
let me win . my wife thinks i &apos;m a wimp .
at least you have a wife . i get divorces and knock people up .
and i &apos;m dressed as doodie .
you &apos;re spud @-@ nik .
come on , who we kidding ? i &apos;m doodie .
please ? she &apos;s watching .
fine .
thanks .
oh , no .
oh , yeah !
my hero !
you &apos;re a weird lady .
ursula said she left her purse .
what a relief . it has the numbers for her prayer chain .
i &apos;m sure it does .
guess i &apos;ll see you at the wedding .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna make it to the wedding .
i wish you all the luck in the world .
and i also want to give you a little piece of advice ..
that i give to everyone who &apos;s getting married .
don &apos;t trust your wife .
i think we &apos;ll be okay .
it &apos;s so perfect , and she &apos;s been saving herself for me .
i can &apos;t let you do this . she &apos;s lying .
what ?
she is lying . and i bet i could prove it . excuse me .
okay . yeah , not a prayer chain .
but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan .
here &apos;s the name tag from where she works as a waitress .
not a teacher , a waitress .
here , she always lies about this .
how old did she say she was ?
she told me she was 25 .
i almost don &apos;t want to show you .
just remember , i &apos;m a minute younger .
i am so stupid .
of course she &apos;s not a teacher .
there &apos;s no such thing as a &quot; top secret school for the children of spies . &quot;
no , you &apos;re not stupid .
i &apos;m not smart .
i just wanted so much to be impulsive for once .
to be romantic .
good .
you should be impulsive and romantic . you did it with the wrong person .
what ?
it &apos;s weird , two people look so alike .
and so different .
eric ! let &apos;s go !
better go deal with it .
yeah , you should .
hurry up ! i gotta pray !
i had to give the kid 50 bucks to stop crying .
that &apos;s not bad .
i also had to go to a few houses as his girlfriend .
i am awful with children .
you &apos;re good with kids . they &apos;re just crazy on halloween .
they &apos;re all greedy , hopped up on sugar .
that &apos;s all it is ?
absolutely .
halloween is the worst . except for christmas . and their birthdays .
they get crazy during the summer too .
and any time they &apos;re hungry or sleepy .
kids are tough . good luck with that .
look , i &apos;m sorry you lost .
i got a secret for you . i let him win .
was that a secret , or a lie ?
no , i let him .. ross ?
yeah ?
would you tell her i let you win , please ?
chandler &quot; let me win . &quot;
no , chandler &apos;s really strong . my arm is so sore . oh , nurse ?
i am strong . i &apos;ll show you .
chandler , please .
what &apos;s the matter ? scared ?
let &apos;s go , big bunny !
one , two , three . go !
