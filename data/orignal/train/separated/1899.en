Superman here broke protocol and ran into the crash
to shield a kid from the blast.
Ethan.
Dad.
Stay with Mom, all right?
Where is my Mom?
Who are you?
It's me, Mom. Ethan.
No, it's not. Who is he?
No, I'm not going anywhere!
How about we set you up in a room
and you can stay with him there?
Brooks, why don't you step up? Switch with Ross.
God, you have fast hands, Brooks.
I know what you're doing.
Just so we're clear, I'm not going down without a fight.
I want you to map me.
I want to know if I'm gonna get alzheimer's.
Patients say it all the time...
"Tell me straight up.
I just want to know what's going on."
Okay, so I've got the results
of your genome sequencing here.
Now we weren't able to get a clear read off Zola's sample.
Sometimes we just have to run it again.
But yours came out.
And?
"Tell me. I can handle it."
And, oh, uh, first off,
I just need to ask you a few questions.
We have a couple of different kinds of,
Um, information here, so--
I have the gene. Just say it.
Look, this test gives us tons of information.
Some of it's clear. And some of it isn't.
So, you know, we don't want to jump to anything
without careful consideration of--
Yeah, I've carefully considered.
Do I have the alzheimer's gene?
You gonna let me get through this questionnaire?
Bailey, you're my mentor
and my friend, and I respect your work,
but I'm telling you, if you don't answer my question,
I will punch you in the face.
We don't dodge your questions 'cause we're mean.
Okay, you have...
tested positive for more than one
of the genetic markers for alzheimer's.
We do it because when you say you want the truth...
You have no idea what you're talking about.
Shepherd says his wife's still unconscious, too.
Oh, what did you do with her kid?
Oh, he... he was in peds overnight,
just so social services didn't haul him off.
His grandmother comes today.
You know what? I thought I was gonna see you last night.
Oh, I got caught up with a patient.
Ah, that's too bad.
I put on that t-shirt
you said I'm not allowed to wear when we're arguing
'cause it makes you forget what your point was.
I can't believe I missed it.
I can throw it on again tonight.
I mean, why is he still out?
You said that he would wake up
when you reversed his hypothermia.
Yeah, I said he might.
Or he might eight hours later or eight days later.
If it's any more than that, we have a problem,
but not until then.
You talk to Russell about it?
He knows about the eight days thing.
Maybe you should just check in with him.
You said yourself that he's not
supervising you that much lately.
There's no news.
If I go to him with this information,
he'll think I've lost my mind.
Well, then he can come talk to me.
Your hair looks really nice today.
My hair looks nice every day.
I'm on Bailey's--
No.
Last time I was with her,
I ordered the wrong test, twice.
If she has a 3-strike policy, I'm out.
I'm on Jackson's service today.
So even if I cared, I wouldn't trade.
What is this?
I don't know what that is.
It is a crumb,
and it was stuck to my laptop
after you used it to update my notes
right next to a splotch of...
what could either be pizza sauce or blood.
I think it's pizza.
I was hoping it was blood, and you were dying
and not just getting pizza all over my computer.
I'm so sorry. I was doing my notes late,
and I hadn't eaten--
I'll go clean it off.
These interns are sloppy.
You people are training sloppy interns.
And I trained you,
which means you're bringing shame to the whole family.
I just got here.
Swag bags for the Syrians.
Some, um, sweatshirts and baseball caps, post-its.
Ooh, really cool penlights.
Ooh, those are nice.
You're sending post-its to Syria?
Yeah, I'm working with doctors aid international.
We've flown in two Syrian doctors.
They're general practitioners, but now with the war,
they've been recruited to staff the field hospitals.
They're getting advanced trauma training
with Seattle Pres, and they're here
for a crash course in basic surgical skills.
They need to learn what they can do quick and dirty.
They rope you in?
Which must mean that...
Yeah. Yeah, they're losing a lot of kids.
Godspeed.
All right, let's get this stuff
with the boxes of supplies we're sending back with them.
Ah, so Bailey got her genome thing funded.
You got this thing funded.
I need to get my cartilage project bankrolled
while we still got bank.
Dr. Hunt?
Dr. Avery's recommendation on your burn patient.
Um, have you rounded on Matthew Taylor yet?
He was one of Avery's patients yesterday.
He was here overnight for observation.
They were worried about a concussion.
He'll probably leave this afternoon.
I think his Mom's coming to get him.
Tell Avery that is fine.
Ready?
Yeah.
Um, wait.
His--his mom is coming to pick him up?
What, can he walk?
You'll have to ask Dr. Avery.
Joyce Basche.
You and I put in a dialysis graft two weeks ago.
She's had fevers to 102 and the site is red and tender.
It looks infected.
Maybe you dropped a pizza crust on her wound.
I told him it's normal, right?
It's red and swollen.
She said come in if it was swollen or red.
He loves doctors, you in particular.
You do like spending time with me.
Get her healthy, we'll have you over for dinner.
Okay, well, he's right.
So give her a gram of cefazolin.
It's probably a post-operative infection.
Dr. Murphy is gonna run some labs
and get an ultrasound.
We'll figure out what's going on.
Okay.
You tested positive for the risk factor genes.
It doesn't mean you're gonna get it.
I know what it means.
It's entirely possible it means nothing at all.
We need an updated will.
I want you to call the lawyer.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.
Even if you get the disease, it's decades away.
It might not be.
We have a child
and we're having another child.
Look, right now, it says that Lexi is Zola's legal guardian
if anything happens to us.
That's not going to work.
No, but--
Derek, we were in a plane crash.
We don't need Alzheimer's--
Potential Alzheimer's.
We need an updated will.
Okay. You're right. I will contact the guy.
Okay.
"She's Killing Me"
Okay, we're gonna try as closely as we can
to replicate your circumstances in the field hospital.
The most important skills you need in a wartime situation
is controlling bleeding.
Normally we'd use lasers and argon beam coagulators,
but as you can see, for now,
We're only using
the contents of this tray.
Is something wrong?
Uh, we, um, before had all of these things,
but recently the supply trucks cannot reach us,
and the electricity is unreliable,
so many of our instruments, we--we cannot use.
So if you want to, um, replicate our circumstances,
we may need to adjust this slightly.
Please. We're here to make this work for you.
Thank you. Um...
This is more right.
Also...
Now we go.
Dr. Shepherd, hey.
I wanted to follow up on the patients we saw yesterday,
'cause I care.
Ross, you should be learning something else
from someone else.
Oh, I am. I'm covering the pit,
which I can do and manage your post-ops.
Also, I brought you a latte.
It's not your job to bring my coffee.
Sorry. I'm here. I had to get a piece of gum.
I had epically bad breath.
I didn't want it to bowl you over in the O.R., but...
I'm all set. See?
I didn't need to see it.
Okay. Well, I'm going to check your post-ops.
Anything you'd like me to look for?
Ross already did it.
Spectacular.
Anything we should know?
Yeah, Rachel Dawson's awake.
Tell Hunt she's up.
We're gonna send you back with a bunch of equipment,
Uh, but if supplies aren't reaching you
and there's no electricity,
then we're gonna have to figure out another way.
Yeah, so, um, take a look around
and see what items you do have left in the field hospital,
and, uh, put it in the box.
Dr. Hunt. Can I borrow you?
I don't think I should go in there.
She's okay now, Ethan.
She was really mad when she saw me before.
She wasn't mad at you. She was confused.
There's something in her head that they needed to fix,
and they've done that.
She's back to her old self again.
You sure?
I don't know 100%, Ethan, but...
I think we should try, okay?
All right.
Ethan?
You're okay?
Come here.
Oh.
Oh, god.
I love you so much.
Did you get hurt?
No?
You look really good.
My car crash mom woke up.
And the lawyer sent over an e-mail
with the forms.
We need two names-- a guardian and a backup.
Before it was Lexie, Cristina, and Owen.
So Cristina and then which one of your sisters
do you want as a backup?
Cristina doesn't want children.
This isn't children. It's zola and fetus.
Stop calling the baby fetus.
Well, she will love him whatever his name is.
All right, talk to her and see what she says.
I know what she'll say.
And I'll be wrong, and that'll be good for everybody.
My talk was a viral sensation.
Cartilage is trending...
Because of me.
I couldn't be happier.
A cartilage regeneration lab
would be a huge boon for the hospital.
I am not an A.T.M.
I have one vote just like you do
and Arizona does.
Oh, no. Arizona has to vote for me 'cause she's my wife.
And your vote is like a vote and a half.
Uh-huh. I'll vote for myself.
Now that is a solid voting block.
You put a lot of thought into this, huh?
Is this how it works?
You all whisper to each other in your board meetings
about your pet projects,
and that's where all the money goes?
That's exactly how it works.
That is not how it works.
Everybody's supposed to submit their proposals in writing.
You can't have people bugging board members
while they're trying to work.
Uh... you're sitting in a chair.
I need money for my orphan thing. I want to take it global.
You see what you've done?
Who canceled my valve replacement?
Hunt canceled half of everybody's day.
Thank you for coming, everyone.
Sorry we had to rearrange your schedule,
but this is important.
We've got two Syrian doctors here.
They used to be GPs.,
but now they're operating in a field hospital
in a war zone.
We were planning on teaching them surgical procedures
they could do with limited resources,
but it turns out they have way less to work with
than we anticipated.
Just give 'em more stuff.
When it runs out in two weeks,
they'll be right back where they started.
He wants to help them function with what they know they have.
Which is this.
So... we need to
be able to do the procedures on this list
using only what is in this box.
Are you kidding me? There's no way.
There has to be. We gotta figure it out.
Joyce Basche's labs. She's in ultrasound now.
Mm. Her white count's pretty high.
And her electrolytes are off.
Um, I think we err on the side of caution
and admit her.
And, uh, this is kind of weird.
Um, we have another post-op complication
on the same day as Mrs. Basche.
And, uh, I scrubbed in on both of them with you.
And you managed their post-op care?
Okay, you better go through
all your notes on both these charts
and figure out what the hell went wrong.
Edwards, you're with me today.
I'm with Dr. Avery today.
Ditch him. Murphy's having a time-out.
What did you do?
So the second post-op infection was your patient, too?
Kathy Dong.
Does she need surgery?
Probably.
And Bailey got Medusa to scrub in with her this afternoon
on the first lady that came in with an infection.
They've gotta take out her shunt.
It's got this huge abscess under it.
It's a mess.
They're gonna kill me.
What did you do?
Did you forget the pre-op antibiotics or scrub too fast?
I was sick. I had the flu or something.
And you came in?
Of course I did.
We all work when were sick, all the time.
Patients have post-op infections
all the time, right?
Okay, so they can debride the wounds
with a basic instrument set,
but now they're faced with a huge risk of infection.
Well, I guess wound vacs are out of the question then.
Simple wet-to-dry dressings might work?
Mm. No.
They'd have to change those out three times a day.
They would use their entire gauze supply with one patient.
Sugar.
Excuse me?
It's not in the box, but they may have it around.
It's an osmotic dressing
that allows you to avoid multiple dressing changes.
Okay. Well, somebody go find out if they still have sugar.
Okay.
Anything?
You've barely made a dent.
It's gonna take forever.
Oh! Well, you try using this hand drill,
Mr. Backseat driver.
Let me try.
If they had an infrascanner, it would be a lot easier.
Well, they don't. I think whoever it is,
you just killed him.
You know, start with a fresh one.
Oh, does anybody have any betadine?
I just have bleach.
Yeah, that'll work.
Sure.
All right.
So anybody ready to start teaching?
Uh, me. I can do fracture repairs.
Yeah, you can put me down.
I got a blade I can use for skin grafting.
Great. Get to the lab. Uh, Shepherd,
How long till Rachel Dawson's out of the I.C.U.?
Oh, check with Ross.
He's tracking her through post-op.
Wait. I thought Brooks was on your service today.
Ross gets connected to the patients.
He likes to follow through.
Owen, peds just called.
Ethan Dawson's grandmother got stuck back east.
Her flight got canceled,
and she's not gonna make it here until tomorrow.
So I think you should call social services
and see if they can take him for the night.
But this is pretty standard, right?
This must happen all the time.
It's an unusually aggressive infection,
but we're gonna take care of it.
Ah, she said it was nothing, and I knew it.
Steven-- no.
I waited a whole day.
I am going to take care of her, you hear me?
And now even if you don't have an electric dermatome,
you can still do skin grafts using blades.
But you want to be very careful
about how much pressure you apply.
You don't want to cut too deep.
Mm. Is that okay?
That's good. But no deeper.
Yeah, that's better.
Okay, so you want to place the screws
medial to the tibial crest
so you don't interfere with intravascular bundle.
Medial to the tibial crest.
Mm-hmm. Now advance the screw by hand. Yeah.
Until it's anchored in the far cortex.
Don't be afraid to push too hard.
Ah, sorry. I'm--I'm just-- I'm trying to figure out
How to hold down the patient to keep him still
while I do this.
Oh, the patient's sedated.
Not when you don't have anesthesia.
O-okay.
Let's go at this another way.
I am so sorry I wasn't here earlier.
It's okay.
We've got these two Syrian doctors here
and we're trying to get all the surgeons
to figure out how to do these procedures
with, like, a piece of gum and a matchstick,
And this was our first pee break.
And meanwhile, you're sitting here.
And you can't even walk?
I thought it was just a small laceration.
It is. I'm fine.
But is it infected? Because you should be able to walk.
April. April.
I don't know why you can't walk.
April, I can walk. I'm...
You can?
W--they said that you-- you couldn't leave
till your mom came to pick you up.
Oh. Uh... I, um...
My mom's not coming here
because I can't get myself home.
She's coming here because
I wanted her to meet you.
I had a low-grade fever.
I felt bad the night before,
but when I woke up, I figured I could muscle through it.
So I came in.
I felt okay for most of the day,
so I figured it wasn't--
Of course I'll take Zola and Fetus.
That's what I told Derek.
You're not shipping them off to Ohio
or wherever his stupid sisters are from.
I knew you would say that.
I will oversee the most competent herd
of child care professionals ever.
I'll get only german nannies.
They're super organized.
I'm not sure a herd of german nannies
is what I had in mind.
Wait. You don't want me to be a stay-at-home mom?
No.
Yeah, 'cause you're not.
Right, but Zola is at the day care here
when we pick her up.
Yeah, and you do 30% less surgeries than I do
'cause you're not putting in the hours anymore.
You don't want to do this.
Hey, I love Zola.
I know you do.
But you don't want to be her mom.
No.
You really hate those sisters?
Kind of.
Not all of them.
Kathleen seems like a good mom.
I mean, I don't want to hang out with her all the time,
but her kids seem sane.
Yeah, well, that's not nothing.
Okay, how about this?
You write in the will
that I get your children three weeks every year.
We'll travel.
I'll take them to get their first tattoo--
Someplace clean.
And I'll teach 'em how to put a condom
on a--on a cucumber.
Okay.
I will be the coolest aunt in the world.
I just can't be a mom.
They deserve a mom.
They already have a mom.
I know.
You're not dying right now. You know that, right?
Dr. Webber. I paged you.
Can you check out bed three?
Patient is Seth Lepik.
Erythema and swelling along a surgical site.
Febrile. Looks pretty sick.
Probably needs to be admitted.
Sorry.
I'll be right back.
Dr. Shepherd just ordered an M.R.I.
on one of his patients.
I thought you were covering the pit.
Oh, I am.
My generation's all about multitasking, sir.
Mr. Lepik, I'm Dr. Webber.
I understand that you're not feeling well.
Yeah, um...
I've been dizzy for a couple of days,
and they said to come back in if I didn't feel good.
They who?
You guys.
I had surgery here a couple of weeks ago.
Oh, here it is. Dr. Bailey operated on you.
Yep.
Okay, well--well, let's see what we have.
So you want to stop the bleeding,
but you don't want to do a blind clamp
in a bloody field.
Uh, your goal is to get control of the hilum.
Since you won't have a stapler,
you can get control by using finger pressure,
like that.
So... just reach in here?
Yeah, you want to feel for the bronchus
and then you'll know you're near the hilum.
Matthew's mother is coming here.
I can't meet her.
I can't lie to a mother.
Don't sell yourself short.
You thought you couldn't lie to Matthew either,
but somehow you had it in you.
What kind of grown man
gets his mommy to pick him up?
They have a good relationship.
He respects women.
He has good values.
I think I'm there.
Okay, so if you don't have a clamp,
You can just use your hand
and twist the lung on the hilar axis.
That's it.
I see it. Thank you.
You know what? He doesn't make fun of me.
He thinks I'm brave.
He likes it when I babble.
He's a unicorn.
He's an amazing guy.
Well, then you should tell him the truth.
I have this really cool technique for autotransfusion
that I would love to show you when you're done here.
Not bad, huh?
Who needs a fancy splint when you have duct tape?
It holds quite nicely.
27 new e-mails about where my research goes next.
It should sound like a cash register to you.
Can you go bug Shepherd for his vote, please?
Oh, I plan to, and I'm sure I'll get it.
Shepherd knows we bought this hospital so that
we could all be the doctors we want to be.
I'm not living my dream.
My dreams are big and bright
and filled with extremely shiny machines
that grow cartilage out of thin air.
I have that dream all the time.
Since you have limited blood supply,
you do this...
And you're giving your patient
their own blood back.
Do you want to give it a try?
Sure.
So...
Are you going to tell this man the truth
or include his mother in the lie?
Because I cannot get on that plane without some closure.
Uh, I-I am so sorry.
You do not need to bother with my stupid problems.
You have real problems.
Courtship troubles
are everyone's troubles.
Wooing my wife was very tricky.
Well, how'd you win her over?
A picnic
of spiced lamb
under the cypress trees,
almonds dipped in honey,
the words of my heart.
Dr. Kepner...
We went to see "Terminator 3."
You were right. Cristina only wants to be the cool aunt.
I'm sorry. I wish I was wrong.
That's okay. What about Kathleen?
What about Lizzie? You two got along.
Oh, I forgot about Lizzie.
You know, I don't want to leave our kids
with somebody you forgot about.
Well, she's the alternate.
Well, it's a disaster plan. Most disasters don't happen.
They do to us.
That's true.
We have survived
an unusual number of very bad things.
At this point, it ups our odds.
Just send the papers.
Uh, apparently we have never filled out
a health care directive.
The lawyer wants that, too.
Oh, well, I mean, you know all of this.
I don't want to be a potato.
No extraordinary measures taken if it's obviously at the end.
He wants it in writing.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
We both know you're gonna give me a lethal dose of morphine
the second I start to forget where my keys are.
I'm not kidding.
Before we knew my mother was sick,
she couldn't remember anything I'd ever said to her.
And I thought it was because she didn't give a crap about me.
I don't want to put my kids through that.
You'll give me a lethal dose, we'll hold hands,
and I'll fade off into the night.
We will cross that bridge when we come to it.
More irrigation.
Looks like I'm gonna have to open this all up.
You doing okay?
I'm fine.
You sure?
Dr. Bailey, don't get all weird on me
because you think you shattered my psyche.
I knew what I was asking when I took that test.
Well, if you ever need to talk...
Stop it.
All right. Fine.
How about we talk about the sloppy job you're doing
raising those crappy interns?
There you go.
What, she sneezed all over my patients,
now I have two post-op infections?
They have no judgment
or common sense.
Mm. Sorry to butt in, Bailey.
I saw a patient of yours from a couple of weeks back.
Post-op infection, pretty extensive.
He's on I.V. antibiotics, but he's gonna need surgery.
You have time today or you want me to handle it?
What do you mean, he? He's a she, and I saw her.
I'm dealing with her
after I deal with this post-op infection.
It's not a she.
Seth Lepik.
It's not the same patient.
It's a third one.
Three? Have you spoken to Hunt?
No, not yet. I thought it was just two.
Look, I'll take care of your third patient.
You need to find Hunt.
Which intern was it?
It's Leah Murphy.
Dr. Darwish, can I get you something?
Oh, no. I'm...
just looking.
It's quiet.
We don't have a lot of quiet anymore.
So there's been a big rainstorm back east,
and your grandma's flight
isn't gonna be able to get in until tomorrow,
So Carol here from social services
is going to take you to a place
that you can sleep tonight.
Why can't I stay here like we did last night?
Well, that's not going to work out.
I don't want to go with her. My mom and dad are here.
It's gonna be fine, okay?
They're gonna give you a great dinner...
and they'll probably give you ice cream for dessert,
and they're gonna let you play video games, so...
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come on.
It's going to be fine. I promise.
Okay, is that...
better?
Yeah. Uh, but, uh, practice it a bunch more times.
The faster you get in and out,
the better your outcomes will be.
Promise me you'll kill me with a lethal injection
before I start to forget where my keys are.
Of course.
Early.
Not when I set the house on fire
because I forgot to shut the stove off
or when I'm sitting in the rocking chair
in the corner of the nursing home.
I don't want my kids to go through what I went through--
Mer, you had me at "Lethal injection."
Wow. Is that my door prize?
Okay, so you know I was working
with these two Syrian guys today?
They barely get any supplies anymore.
I mean, this is all they have to work with.
But the attendings all pitched in,
and we figured out a whole bunch
of lifesaving procedures they can do.
That's great.
Yeah. Um...
My point is...
You think you need everything,
But you don't.
We could get by without a lot of stuff, right?
Sure.
What exactly are we getting by without?
My virginity.
I was...
I was a virgin for a really long time,
and then I wasn't.
Uh, I... really wanted to wait
for someone like you...
for marriage, but I screwed up.
And I was just-- I was so scared to tell you.
But then I was watching these guys today,
and they--they literally have nothing left,
and they're making do.
And then I-I just felt like I was being so stupid
to--to worry about this one little thing,
Li-like--like you couldn't even get over it.
So...
I guess I would be an ungrateful jerk
if I worried about your virginity
while there's a war going on somewhere and people are dying?
That what you're saying to me?
No, no. I-I-I didn't--
You didn't think I'd be more hung up on the lying?
'Cause I bet even in a war, people still value honesty.
He's still not awake?
Uh, no, not yet.
I gave him a bolus of D50. We'll see if that helps.
Why didn't you talk to me first?
Because I talked to Russell about it,
like you asked me to.
But you knew that I was concerned about this case.
You really want me to have three highly trained surgeons
supervising one man's recovery?
It shouldn't be news to you
that we work as a team at this hospital.
Oh, yes, and the entire team
is helping you save Syria from itself.
I came up with, like, 14 ways of doing thoracotomy procedures
without a chest tray.
I didn't have time for a groupthink
on perfectly straightforward post-op care.
Tomorrow, you, Russell, myself
will round on Paul together, all right?
Are you serious?
I am.
Uh, Dr. Hunt, I need to speak with you.
Could you give me moment?
It has to be now.
And Webber's in the O.R. with the third.
So we have no idea how extensive this is?
All right. You and I are gonna need to talk to infection control,
let them know what we know so far.
I need you to find all your charts from that day,
figure out every patient you touched in post-op,
or anywhere, for that matter.
We're gonna need to call every one of them,
have them come in, and exam them.
This is going to be a nightmare.
They're gonna fire me, aren't they?
Just go.
Still unconscious?
Bummer.
It's okay. He'll wake up in a couple of days,
If we can all relax and be patient about it.
Good.
Yeah, tell that to Owen.
We may be losing Leah Murphy from the program.
Did I like her?
I think you said once that she didn't suck
as much as you expected her to suck.
Oh. That's too bad.
You know, maybe Owen doesn't like being chief.
What makes you say that?
I thought he did,
but lately, he's had a bug up his butt
about Russell not supervising me.
You know, maybe it's because he misses teaching.
I mean, Derek--he hated all that administrative crap
when he was chief, right?
Owen's had nothing but that for weeks.
Maybe he feels like
he's losing touch with the medicine?
Or maybe it's because Russell's not supervising you.
Okay, I just agreed to off you
the minute you started acting dotty.
Shouldn't you be on my side for the rest of the day
just as a courtesy?
Ross was working the pit today?
Yes. Okay, I just took out an infected dialysis graft.
He saw the patient before I did...
But he didn't scrub in with me
because he wanted to make sure your M.R.I.
was just the way you liked it.
Hey, Dr. Webber.
Someone just put a glioblastoma resection
on your schedule for tomorrow.
Did you want to do that before or after your aneurysm?
Shane, you have to stop.
I am working with Brooks now.
Yeah, but she annoys you, doesn't she?
I mean, you and I kind of get along.
Brooks has an instinct for this that you don't have.
You make up for it with a ton of work.
Well, if I'm making up for it, who cares how?
I care.
And you should, too.
You should find a specialty where you shine.
This is what I'm passionate about.
Doesn't that count for anything?
She's better at this than you are.
And that means, to me, I have to teach her, not you.
You're gonna be a great surgeon.
Go figure out where.
Guy can't take a hint, huh?
Where are we going, sensei?
We are going to check in on Rachel Dawson,
see if her neuro exams have improved.
You went with spearmint gum this time.
Yeah. You can smell it?
Mm. I can.
Do you like spearmint?
Not really, no.
Just use peripheral vascular instruments
if you don't have stuff for peds.
Okay, so pass the umbilical tape around the vessel.
And then thread both ends
through the short rubber catheter
and place the hemostat.
There.
Uh, could I borrow her for a moment?
Yes, but not for long, please.
Uh, I would like to admit Ethan Dawson
to peds for the night.
Oh, he'll be fine with social services.
Kids go with them every day.
This kid doesn't have to.
Owen, there's protocol for a reason.
Yeah, but we're human for a reason.
I know that you've taken a special interest in this kid--
Why is everybody acting like
this is some kind of a character flaw?
He ought to stay. He's sick.
I got a look at him when I checked his wrist.
Short limb syndrome.
Karev.
Right. He's right.
Uh, limited growth, excessive sleeping, and eating.
Impulse control problems.
Th-these are all the symptoms of childhood.
Can't be sure.
Not until we confirm it
with testing and observation.
Guys, guys, I love the enthusiasm,
but it's not gonna happen.
All right.
Cristina said she would pull the trigger
if it comes to that.
You're my wife.
Can we make the decision together
if we're gonna throw in the towel?
That sounds fair.
It's not gonna be easy on you if I start to lose it.
Oh, don't worry.
You're a project even with all your marbles.
I brought you something.
You did?
I had Bailey do my genome.
You did?
Yeah.
High-risk for liver cancer and prostate cancer?
Yeah. You're telling me.
Male pattern baldness?
Late onset, apparently.
Heroin addiction?
I'm a real prize.
It's all a crapshoot.
We didn't get one single definite.
We only got maybes.
Ah, maybe we live forever.
Maybe we do, and maybe I become a bald heroin addict.
Honey, I'm gonna get these bags down to the car.
Uh, thanks, Mom.
Wrapping it up for the day?
Yep.
How about you let me buy you dinner?
I want to bend your ear about a project I'm thinking about.
You and everyone else
are free to submit your proposals in writing
to the entire board.
And then I will vote like everyone else does.
Hell, maybe I'll submit one myself.
Maybe I have an idea,
but I'm not out here hawking it to people at work.
'Cause I'm gonna write a proposal like you're supposed to.
Um... son,
nobody's ever saying yes to your proposal.
You're the most powerful vote on the board.
You're the person who says yes to other people's ideas.
We still let you be a surgeon.
Nobody wanted to take that away from you.
But your project is this hospital.
Yeah, it's exhausting sometimes.
Yeah.
You know something I learned when I was the chief?
What?
Somebody offers to buy you dinner
while they talk your ear off
about something you don't want to hear...
You say yes.
Look at that. You're a natural.
Oh, looks like you got this.
Yes, but...
not as fast as it could be.
Practice, practice, practice.
Thank you for all you've taught us.
I wish it could be more. It feels like nothing.
If we will help even one child,
it's everything.
Short limb syndrome?
Yeah, we're not sure.
At this point, we're just admitting him for observation.
We'll know more in the morning.
Thank you.
So got your own TV,
they serve a chocolate pudding that's not half bad,
and I'm gonna see if I can scare up some comic books, okay?
You okay?
You just told the nurse I was sick.
Yeah, you're... fake sick.
The nurse knows that. Even...
All the doctors know it.
We're just pretending so you can stay here tonight.
There is nothing wrong with you.
Is it fake with my mom and dad?
No.
No, I wish it was.
My dad's still not awake?
No, he's not.
Is he ever gonna wake up?
I don't know.
So... you played soccer.
I did.
Owen's been acting crazy.
I think this is why.
The left defender is crucial.
Kids make you crazy.
Yeah.
Kinda cute, though.
Dr. Grey.
I'm not gonna get fired.
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
No, it's worse than that.
Dr. Bailey, Joyce is crashing.
What?
Dr. Kepner, you have given us piles of supplies already.
This equipment is expensive.
Yeah, but this will really help.
Oh, and you should definitely take this.
It's an infrascanner.
It can detect a brain bleed.
Are you sure this is all right?
Perhaps you need to talk to Dr. Hunt.
Don't worry about it.
Honesty's not all it's cracked up to be.
They say the truth will set you free.
What the hell do they know?
The truth is horrible, frightening.
The truth is more than you can bear.
Bailey said the second patient isn't responding to antibiotics.
So she's going to need surgery.
I just operated on the third.
He's hypotensive and still pretty unstable.
Once Murphy's identified
all her patients for the day,
then we'll get them in here,
make sure no one else is infected.
We're gonna need to make some kind of statement.
Before this gets out there on its own.
The first patient, Joyce Basche,
she didn't make it.
I thought that the surgery would get rid of the infection, but...
You need to get cultures on the other two right away.
And we need to make sure that we're using the right antibiotics
so that this doesn't get out of control.
Okay.
We just lost Joyce Basche.
Dr. Bailey...
No, she's her patient. She should know.
Leah checked all the charts.
She was only on two of the patients
that got the infection.
She never touched the third one.
What, is that supposed to reassure me?
A woman just died.
It couldn't have been Leah.
The only doctor who touched all three patients was you.
We're gonna need to get legal down here.
Wait. Any--anything could've caused this kind of infection.
Yeah, no--
Well, we know that, but until there's an investigation--
No, um, I gotta go, 'cause I have two more people--
Owen?
Dr. Webber will deal with them.
Yeah, this is Dr. Avery.
Get me Joelle Geller from legal down here, Conference Room two.
I will...
go over my notes.
Sit down, Dr. Bailey.
No. M-my patients are in danger.
Dr. Webber will take care of them.
I haven't even told Joyce's husband that she didn't make it.
I know the man!
I don't need Grey to tell him that I killed his wife!
Dr. Bailey, please sit down.
We're supposed to be straight with you,
so be careful what you ask for
when you walk into a hospital.
What are you saying?
I'm asking you to sit down.
Because when you find out what's really going on...
