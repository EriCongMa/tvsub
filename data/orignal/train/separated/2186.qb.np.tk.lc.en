honolulu approach ...
level at 3,000 .
717 , turn left , zero @-@ one @-@ zero ...
tower control ...
transport one has just touched down .
notify convoy .
steve .
joe .
i was surprised when you called .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m glad you did .
sorry we haven &apos;t talked much lately .
i &apos;ve been busy .
oh , yeah , i heard about that-- private security .
figured you &apos;d be living in a saddle by now .
yeah . well , i guess the only thing
the navy didn &apos;t teach me was how to relax .
appreciate you doing me this favor on such short notice .
so , joe , who &apos;s the guy ?
mitch lange .
emergency management specialist with the air force .
he spent the last six weeks in manila
fighting an outbreak of a new strain of bird flu classified h5n4 .
the cdc says it has an 85 % mortality rate .
mr. lange is the first american to contract it .
lucky us , huh ?
yeah .
so ... let &apos;s get him to tripler ,
and the loco moco &apos;s on me .
you &apos;re gonna owe me a little more than
a burger and rice for this one , joe .
okay , i &apos;ll buy you shave ice , too .
how &apos;s mary ?
good .
and your team-- how &apos;s your team ?
good .
got a new guy from chicago .
and let me guess : he &apos;s good .
yeah . he &apos;s great , actually .
you know , steve , if i didn &apos;t know better ,
i would swear there was something on your mind .
you want to do this with me ?
you want to talk circles with me , huh ? you know i got questions .
and i &apos;m not gonna duck them anymore .
you want answers-- i &apos;m here to give you answers .
fire away .
did you know about my mother &apos;s relationship with wo fat ?
i knew that she took care of him after his mother was killed ,
until the cia found out about it
and they forced her to abandon him .
and i promised her i would never tell you that .
so why are you telling me now ?
because you deserve to know the truth .
okay .
here &apos;s the thing , joe-- i already got the truth ,
and i got from the person i least expected it from .
wo fat ?
yeah .
and i bet that pissed you off .
well , i put a bullet in his head .
what do you think ?
steve ...
i believe that your mother
always did what she thought was right .
what my mother did was self @-@ serving ,
and it was all to cover up the murder of an innocent woman .
wo fat &apos;s mother was an innocent woman .
doris had an assignment-- that death was collateral .
she covered it up , and that is a crime .
so i tell you where she is , and what--
what are you gonna do then ?
are you gonna go arrest your own mother ?
are you gonna tell me where she is ?
you just finished telling me you &apos;re done ducking my questions .
joe ! joe , you all right ?
don &apos;t let them take lange !
joe ...
can you move ?
huh ? my leg is pinned .
what about the door ?
oh , you ...
you mean that thing that ...
that used to open and close ?
i think we lost our rental deposit on that .
all right .
sorry , buddy .
you &apos;re bleeding .
not the first time .
all right .
okay ...
this was a coordinated attack .
steve , what &apos;s up ?
chin , our motorcade has been compromised .
a team of six guys
with fully automatic weapons
hijacked the transport vehicle ,
and are now on the move with our patient .
all right , it &apos;s a government vehicle--
it should have gps . you guys okay ?
yeah , we &apos;re all right .
okay .
joe &apos;s checking on the convoy .
tracking the sprinter now .
all right , i got &apos; em . they &apos;re heading north on nimitz .
joe , i gotta go .
steve , sit tight and wait for ems .
i &apos;ll get hpd on the sprinter .
there &apos;s no time .
heading west on pacific , chin .
okay , take pacific to iwilei ,
and that should cut them off .
got it .
wait a minute .
they &apos;ve stopped .
north king and iwilei .
steve !
i &apos;m here . it &apos;s empty .
there &apos;s only one reason they &apos;d take that patient--
the virus .
chin ,
contact homeland security and cdc--
i think we &apos;re looking at a major national security situation here .
hey , you know what ?
why don &apos;t you get an apartment next @-@ door ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re here so often .
huh ? how about that ?
i &apos;m fine . thanks for asking .
uh @-@ huh . hey , doc , make sure you punch his card , huh ?
you all right ?
doctors , could you give us a minute , please ?
thank you .
you all right ?
yeah .
this time .
so , what do we know ?
not much . uh , the traffic cams
showed your guys taking lange from the sprinter ,
put him in a cargo van , no plates ,
last seen heading north .
hpd &apos;s trying to run a background on the patient right now
to see if maybe there &apos;s , uh , some sort of mo .
i &apos;ll tell you something , that was a well @-@ executed hit .
this wasn &apos;t personal-- i &apos;m thinking ...
i &apos;m thinking this could be an act of terrorism .
if their goal is to weaponize the virus ,
that &apos;s a hell of a threat .
well , look , the ...
the whole island is on lockdown , okay ?
cdc &apos;s setting up screening systems
at the airports , harbors--
everything is being monitored .
there is zero chance
those guys are leaving with lange .
that still leaves us with a potential exposure of a million people .
it &apos;s better than billions .
max , we gotta get an i.d. on this guy .
let &apos;s push him up to the front of the line .
copy that . posthaste .
you okay ?
don &apos;t worry .
it &apos;s gonna take more than a wrecking ball to stop steve .
i spoke with the construction manager .
the site &apos;s been down
for two months since funding dried up .
these guys did their homework .
they knew what time lange was being transported
and the route they were taking .
but this is what doesn &apos;t add up .
the decision to bring lange to oahu was made 72 hours ago .
and it was never announced to the public .
so how &apos;d they know lange was being brought here ?
exactly .
what &apos;s going on ? why are we here ?
mrs. lange , my name is joe white .
i led your husband &apos;s transport detail this morning .
did something happen ?
we were supposed to meet mitch at tripler army medical hospital ,
and then when we landed , they brought us here .
no one &apos;s telling us anything .
we had a situation on the way to the hospital .
what does that mean , &quot; a situation &quot; ?
your husband was abducted .
abducted by whom ?
we don &apos;t know .
but i promise you , we &apos;re doing everything we can
to get mitch back .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re here ?
you don &apos;t want us telling anybody .
the situation is very sensitive .
i don &apos;t understand .
how could this happen ?
my husband was supposed to receive a serum today .
the cdc said he needed it to survive .
and we have every intention of getting it to him .
but you have to find him first .
and he doesn &apos;t have much time .
i &apos;m gonna find your husband , mrs. lange .
i promise .
in the meantime , i &apos;m gonna have to ask you
and your family to stay here .
i &apos;m very sorry .
mr. white ...
don &apos;t let my dad die .
steve , yeah .
okay , i &apos;ll be right there .
per lieutenant kelly , i just finished performing
what i refer to as warp speed autopsy .
i missed you , max .
who is he ?
john doe for now .
no hits on afis or codis .
however , i did find
foreign substances that he recently inhaled
in his nostrils and his respiratory system .
i sent them over to the crime lab for analysis .
the results were charred burlap and pine needles .
any idea where they came from ?
could have been from a number of sources .
he could &apos;ve been near a campfire or at a fireplace .
okay , let &apos;s look into more possible sources .
anything else ?
yes . i also performed a full ct scan on the body .
as you can see ,
he has a remarkable amount of shrapnel in his body .
this guy &apos;s seen battle .
if he &apos;s u.s. military ,
his prints would be on afis .
all right , we need to get his photograph to interpol
and every antiterrorist agency .
somebody has to be able to i.d this guy .
chin , kono ,
this is dr. nalani dyer .
she &apos;s the honolulu cdc station director .
what do you have for us , doctor ?
i &apos;m afraid to say we &apos;ve confirmed
there was a breach of the dhs server .
confidential e @-@ mails were compromised .
we believe that &apos;s how your suspects
obtained the transport intel .
do you know where the breach came from ?
unfortunately , they left no digital footprint .
but dhs agrees with your assessment
this is an act of terrorism .
potus has given us the go @-@ ahead to raise
the ntas alert level to imminent threat .
so , doctor , what do we know about this virus ?
it &apos;s a mutated strain of the avian flu .
about six weeks ago ,
a farmer in the davao region of the philippines came down with it .
one week later , we reported 105 cases .
as of 7 : 00 a.m. this morning ,
we have 1,400 cases , 1,315 deaths .
okay , how &apos;s it transmitted ?
as far we know ,
only through direct human contact .
once you &apos;re infected ,
the incubation period has been shown to be anywhere
from a few hours to 21 days .
after symptoms appear , patients usually die within five days .
so i guess that flu shot i just got isn &apos;t gonna cover this .
we &apos;ve been working on a serum .
mitch lange was due to receive it this afternoon .
if he doesn &apos;t get it soon , he &apos;ll be dead tomorrow .
doctor , any idea how one might weaponize this virus ?
well , lange is too ill to send into
a crowded area without raising suspicion .
so they &apos;d use his blood .
which is no easy task .
they &apos;d need an expert to keep the virus stable
and a biosafety level 4 lab to work in .
is there one of those labs on the island ?
no . there are only 15 in the united states .
closest one to here is in montana .
unless they built their own .
it &apos;s possible .
but they &apos;d need very specific equipment .
positive pressure personnel suits ,
decontamination chemicals ,
an uninterrupted power supply ,
just for starters .
well , that &apos;s good .
not exactly a run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill trip to home depot .
all right , we need to track down
any recent purchases of this kind of equipment .
if we can find a buyer ,
could lead us to lange .
i bet you &apos;re reconsidering that retirement right about now .
there &apos;s nothing else i would rather be doing .
oh , yeah . i figured you &apos;d say that .
don &apos;t worry , i won &apos;t die
before i tell you what you want to know .
look , steve , i already reached out to my contacts .
these guys know the handlers that your mother reports to .
they &apos;ll find her .
that was fast .
wrong guys .
yeah .
walt , appreciate you getting back to me .
mahalo .
no , that &apos;s hawaiian for thank you .
you got to get out of the beltway more , man .
what do you got ?
homeland security contact came through .
they got a hit on our john doe .
all right .
his name is zahir morina .
he joined the kosovo liberation army
when he was old enough to carry a gun ,
and he served till the kla disbanded in &apos; 99 .
well , it &apos;s good to see he &apos;s kept busy .
he &apos;s got a red notice on interpol .
everything from murder and extortion to armed robbery .
so either he &apos;s joined up with a new terrorist group ,
or the kla just made a hell of a comeback .
dhs classifies the kla
as an inactive terrorist organization ,
so if they were in a rebuilding mode ,
we &apos;d have heard something .
i just got off the phone with oahu state university .
one of their professors ,
a dr. howard rennick , head of virology ,
purchased $ 30,000 worth of lab equipment
in the past 72 hours ,
all materials needed to build your very own level 4 lab .
is there any chance he needed that stuff for work ?
the university didn &apos;t authorize it if he did .
and apparently rennick hasn &apos;t shown up for class in three days .
maybe because he &apos;s busy weaponizing a virus .
either we &apos;re right about our virus doctor ,
or this guy really doesn &apos;t like company .
we need to find another way in .
cover me ! moving !
what the hell is he doing ?
exactly what i &apos;d do .
well , i guess that settles it .
what ?
you weren &apos;t really born a crazy son of a bitch .
this is the guy that taught you .
clear !
who are these guys ?
beside from being pro gun , no idea .
so where &apos;s rennick ?
on me .
mrs. rennick ?
yes .
where &apos;s your husband ?
they took him .
who ? who took him ?
i don &apos;t know .
was this one of the guys ?
yeah , that was one of them .
thanks .
how is she ?
she &apos;s uh , she &apos;s pretty shaken up ,
but i think she &apos;s gonna be all right .
she said six armed gunmen stormed the house three days ago .
what the hell is th ...
they threatened to kill her
if dr. rennick didn &apos;t go with them .
she just i.d. &apos; d zahir morina as one of the crew .
so the same crew that grabbed mitch lange
also took dr. rennick and used his credit card
and medical license to acquire the lab equipment .
right , and his wife is the leverage
to make sure he does exactly what they want .
now , the fact that she &apos;s still alive says to me
rennick has not finished weaponizing the virus .
we need confirmation that rennick is capable of doing the job ,
otherwise they &apos;re gonna kill him
and get somebody else who is .
guys ...
take a look at this .
did facial rec on our two dead shooters .
both got flagged by interpol .
who are they ?
leka bogdani , remzi kostin .
bogdani is ex @-@ albanian armed forces
and kostin-- ex @-@ russian ground forces .
which can only mean one thing-- they &apos;re mercenaries .
all right , we need to find out who put this
all @-@ star team of scumbags together .
is there any connection between these two ?
i might have found one . back in the 90s
they were all cia assets .
and their handler was an ex @-@ field operative
named michael carson .
michael carson
what , you know him , joe ?
i met him years ago .
carson was part of a cia recon team
in the early years of the afghan war .
he turned that conflict into his own personal atm ,
until things went sideways and they put him away
for trying to smuggle gold back into the states .
that was 15 years ago .
it says here he was released from allenwood over a year ago ,
and there &apos;s no record of anything he &apos;s been up to since .
well , we know what he &apos;s up to--
he &apos;s putting a team of old contacts together to steal a bioweapon .
all right , we need to find out
who hired carson to weaponize this virus .
and hope they haven &apos;t paid him to release it , too .
you know , that might be the play .
before he joined the agency ,
he was part of a counterterrorism op .
he used to oversee a think tank of scientists
who were running these biowarfare scenarios .
everything from anthrax in the mail
to sarin gas in the subways .
pretty much the worst kind of stuff you can think of .
maybe one of those scenarios could be carson &apos;s next move .
dr. rennick isn &apos;t just a colleague .
he &apos;s been a mentor to me .
he &apos;s also the best virologist i know .
all right , um ...
this is a silly question , but , uh , is he capable of , uh ,
weaponizing h5n4 ?
honestly ?
yes .
if anyone can pull it off , it &apos;s him .
okay , so ... how would he do that ?
theoretically , he could use a process called lyophilization .
i &apos;m gonna stop you right there ...
it &apos;s essentially freeze @-@ drying .
like when they make astronaut food ?
exactly . it extends the shelf life of vaccines ,
but it can also be used on viruses .
turns them into a fine white powder which can be inhaled ,
ingested or otherwise transmitted .
all you need is a delivery system
and you got yourself a biological weapon .
and how long would it take , uh ,
to turn the avian flu into something like that ?
hard to say for sure .
if i had to guess ...
no more than 12 hours .
but this is all theoretical , right ?
you do understand that
if there &apos;s a widespread outbreak of this virus ,
we &apos;d be looking at a slate wiper .
slate wiper ?
from all the projections we &apos;ve done ,
a weaponized h5n4 would decimate the population .
of oahu ?
the world .
do you want to call grace ?
and tell her what , exactly ?
hey , honey , there &apos;s this nut job out there
and he &apos;s trying to wipe out the entire population ...
just to , uh , make some money .
what &apos;s the point ? if that doctor &apos;s right ,
the virus is already being weaponized--
what difference does it make ?
okay , then we &apos;re gonna have to find out
how it &apos;s being distributed ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s the only way we &apos;re gonna stop it .
impressive resume , mr. kula .
i think you &apos;ll fit in nicely around here .
if you wouldn &apos;t mind waiting a minute ,
i &apos;ll get somebody from senior management to show you around .
excellent .
sit tight .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i think you got a problem in here .
there &apos;s bees coming in through the vent .
help !
open the door !
please !
help me !
help me ...
i &apos;ve been looking into biowarfare scenarios
that carson was familiar with .
now given his training ,
there are several viable means of distribution .
dirty bombs , ventilation systems ,
even bees .
bees ?
yeah , they &apos;re a viable distribution system .
we used to run scenarios using bees
with substances like anthrax .
the powder adheres to their wings .
once they &apos;re released , they spread the virus .
making it airborne .
right .
wait a minute , hold on--
max found charred burlap and pine needles in morina &apos;s lungs .
which could be used in a bee smoker .
well , that &apos;s just great .
why don &apos;t we just put an apb out on every bee on the island
and everything &apos;ll be just fine .
actually , that &apos;s not a bad idea .
commerce of bees is heavily monitored on the island .
they &apos;re illegal to import
and there are only a few places to buy them .
given that carson needs an uninterrupted power supply ,
i &apos;ll cross @-@ reference any recent spikes
in kilowatt @-@ hours against addresses
where bees are purchased and sold .
automatic weapons and bees .
i think we &apos;re in the right place .
you think ?
respirators on .
janek ?
janek ?
i got eyes on lange .
copy that .
secure the lab .
get cdc in for an immediate evac .
copy .
let &apos;s move .
cover me ! move in !
right there , right there .
joe !
joe !
what the hell is he doing now ?
joe !
talk to me ! what &apos;s going on ?
carson &apos;s dead .
what are you doing ?
the bees are loose in the van .
joe !
i can &apos;t let them get out , steve .
joe , stop the van . we &apos;ll call cdc .
there &apos;s no time .
joe , what are you doing ? stop the van .
i can &apos;t do that , steve .
i have to neutralize the threat . you know that .
&quot; the only easy day was yesterday . &quot;
joe !
this is detective danny williams .
we need a fire rescue ,
hazmat and cdc to makai pier right now .
could you be any more dramatic ?
i could &apos;ve held my breath for another 30 seconds ,
but ... i didn &apos;t want you getting wet .
oh , really ? really ?
how &apos;d you know i &apos;d jump in ?
i trained you , son .
swim over here . give me your hand .
no , you don &apos;t want to do that , steve .
i could be contagious .
joe , esu and cdc &apos;s on their way , all right ?
just hang tight .
you could &apos;ve killed yourself , you know that ?
nothing you wouldn &apos;t have done yourself .
he &apos;s right .
you would have done something equally stupid .
i guess that depends on
how you define &quot; stupid . &quot;
sit tight .
how &apos;s mitch ?
he got the serum .
so far , his vitals are stable .
that &apos;s great news .
i can &apos;t thank you enough , mr. white .
there &apos;s no need .
i &apos;m just glad we were able to get mitch back to you and your family .
mr. white ...
you can call me joe , son .
uh , joe , i @-@ i just wanted to say ...
thank you for keeping your promise .
you said you &apos;d bring my dad home , and ... you did .
you &apos;re welcome .
beckham , you take good care of your mom and your sister ,
and tell your dad that i &apos;m thinking about him .
yes , sir .
good @-@ bye .
bye .
wow ! i like what you &apos;ve done with the place .
this is home for the next 21 days .
21 days ? ! when was the last time you had three weeks &apos; vacation ?
never . i don &apos;t know what the hell i &apos;m gonna do with myself .
oh , you &apos;ll be fine .
you won &apos;t have to do it alone , either--
i &apos;ll come down every day and visit .
i might even set up a chessboard .
what do the doctors say ?
so far , no infection .
they &apos;re gonna keep sticking me with needles
for the next three weeks , make sure .
other than that , there &apos;s nothing to do but wait .
well , it was worth it .
why ? what &apos;d you find out ?
carson &apos;s endgame-- it was dc .
he co @-@ opted a local company--
they have agricultural clearance
to ship their honeybees across the country .
his financials tied him to a new terror group
out of the middle east .
dhs got them at dulles airport
waiting for the bees to arrive .
we saved a lot of lives , joe .
well , that &apos;s what we &apos;re trained to do .
yeah .
tell you the truth , when i was on that pier ...
i wasn &apos;t thinking about all the lives at stake ,
i was ...
i was thinking about you .
me ?
you &apos;re the closest thing i ever had to a son , steve ,
and there &apos;s nothing i wouldn &apos;t do to protect you .
most of all , i didn &apos;t want to let you down ...
again .
you never let me down , joe .
you just kept a whole lot of stuff from me .
well , that stops now .
yeah .
i have news of your mother .
oh , yeah ?
i heard from my contacts that
doris was supposed to check in with her handlers 36 hours ago ,
but she never did .
what happened ?
we don &apos;t know .
it can only mean one of two things : either ...
she &apos;s dead ...
or she went off the grid ; and knowing your mother ,
if she doesn &apos;t want to be found , she won &apos;t be .
somebody tipped her off we &apos;re looking for her .
oh , you think it was me ?
after all these years ,
you don &apos;t trust me .
you &apos;ve been playing both sides of the fence , joe .
can you blame me ?
no ... no , i don &apos;t .
but i promise you this--
when i get out of here ,
you and i are gonna go find doris together .
you &apos;ve made me a lot of promises over the years , too .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
trust me .
okay .
let me hear you say it .
i trust you , joe .
thank you .
we on line ?
i thought you said you trusted him .
i lied .
