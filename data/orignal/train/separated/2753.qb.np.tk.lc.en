alright , somebody .
ok , i &apos;ll go .
ok , senior year of college ... on a pool table .
that &apos;s my sister .
ok ... my weirdest place would have to be ...
the women &apos;s room on the second floor of
the new york city public library .
oh my god ! what were you doing in a library ?
pheebs , what about you ?
oh ... milwaukee .
it is a really wired place .
um ... ross ?
disneyland , 1989 , &apos; it &apos;s a small world after all.&apos;
no way !
the ride broke down .
so , carol and i went behind
a couple of those mechanical dutch children ...
then they fixed the ride ,
and we were asked never to return to the magic kingdom .
let &apos;s see , that leaves ....
oh , rachel .
oh come on , i already went .
you did not go !
come on .
oh , alright . the weirdest place would have to be ...
oh , the foot of the bed .
step back . we have a winner !
this must be what the fridge looks like with the door closed .
spooky .
anybody hungry ?
we got a klondike ... soup .
i just never had a relationship with that kind of passion ,
you know , where you have to have somebody right there ,
in the middle of a theme park .
well , it was the only thing to do there that didn &apos;t have a line .
there , well , see ?
barry wouldn &apos;t even kiss me on a miniature golf course .
come on .
no , he said we were holding up the people behind us .
and you didn &apos;t marry him because ... ?
i mean , do you think there are people
who go through life never having that kind of ...
probably .
but you know , i &apos;ll tell you something .
passion is way overrated .
yeah right .
it is . eventually , it kind of ... burns out .
but hopefully , what you &apos;re left with is trust , and security , and ...
well , in the case of my ex @-@ wife , lesbianism .
so , you know , for all of those people who miss out on
that passion ... thing , there &apos;s all that other good stuff .
ok .
but , um ... i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be you .
you don &apos;t .
uh @-@ uh . see , i see .... big passion in your future .
really ?
mmmm .
you do ?
i do .
oh ross , you &apos;re so great .
it &apos;s never gonna happen .
what ?
you and rachel .
why not ?
because you waited too long to make your move ,
and now you &apos;re in the friend zone .
no , no , no . i &apos;m not in the zone .
ross , you &apos;re mayor of the zone .
i &apos;m taking my time , alright ?
i &apos;m laying the groundwork .
yeah . i mean , every day i get just a little bit closer to ...
priesthood !
look ross , i &apos;m telling you , she has no idea what you &apos;re thinking .
she just ran her fingers through my hair .
were you missing that interaction ?
no , no , no .
this is running fingers through your hair , okay ?
now this is a tousle .
if you don &apos;t ask her out soon
you &apos;re going to end up stuck in the zone forever .
i will , i will . see , i &apos;m waiting for the right moment .
what ? what , now ?
yeeeeaaaahhh !
what &apos;s messing you up ?
the wine ? the candles ? the moonlight ?
you &apos;ve just got to go up to her and say ,
&apos;rachel , i think that ... &apos;
what are you shushing ?
we &apos;re shushing ... because ... we &apos;re trying to hear something .
what ?
don &apos;t you hear that ?
see ?
would you like some gum ?
um , is it sugarless ?
sorry , it &apos;s not .
oh , then no thanks .
what the hell was that ?
mental note : if jill goodacre offers you gum , you take it .
if she offers you mangled animal carcass , you take it .
* new york city has no power , *
* and the milk is getting sour . *
* but to me it is not scary , *
* because i stay away from dairy *
ok , here goes .
are you going to do it ?
i &apos;m going to do it .
do you want any help ?
you come out there , you &apos;re a dead man .
good luck , man .
hey , where are you going ?
outside .
you can &apos;t go out there .
why not ?
because of ... the reason .
and that would be ?
i , um , can &apos;t tell you.-
joey , what &apos;s going on ?
ok , you &apos;ve got to promise that
you &apos;ll never , ever tell ross that i told you .
about what ?
he &apos;s planning your birthday party .
oh my god ! i love him !
you &apos;d better act surprised.-
about what ?
my surprise party !
what surprise party ?
oh stop it .
joey already told me .
well , he didn &apos;t tell me .
hey , don &apos;t look at me . this is ross &apos;s thing .
this is so typical .
i &apos;m always the last one to know everything .
no , you are not . we tell you stuff .
yuh @-@ huh ! i was the last one to know
when chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo .
i was the last one to know when you had a crush on joey
when he was moving in .
what ?
looks like i was second to last .
you had a crush on me ?
all right . it wasn &apos;t a crush , it was a dent .
big dent ?
you were moving your furniture .
i thought you had nice arms .
nice arms , huh ?
hey , mon , l &apos; m moving the chair .
do anything for you ?
with all the lights out you can actually see the stars .
hmmm ... this is so nice .
ok , i have a question . .
well , actually , it &apos;s not so much a question as ..
more of a general wondering ... ment
ok . here goes .
for a while now , i &apos;ve been wanting to , um ....
yes , yes , that &apos;s right ...
oh , look at the little cat !
what ? ow !

* looking down on creation and the only explanation i can find , *
this is just bactine . it won &apos;t hurt .
sorry , that was wax .
oh , poor little tooty is scared to death .
we should find his owner .
why don &apos;t we just put &apos; poor little tooty &apos; out in the hall ?
during a blackout ? he &apos;d get trampled ! -
yeah ?
damage control . get back to the gum .
you know , on second thought , gum would be perfection .
&apos;gum would be perfection &apos; ? , &apos;
&apos;gum would be perfection.&apos;
could have said &apos; gum would be nice , &apos;
or &apos; i &apos;ll have a stick &quot;
but no , no , no , no .
for me , gum is perfection .
i loathe myself .
oh no , the mendels , they hate all living things ,
