what are you doing ? you got something ?
no , no , i don &apos;t have anything .
i told you , if we want to catch anything today , danny ,
we got to trawl .
no , no , no ,
trawling is not fishing .
that is you just driving
around in the boat , just like you driving my car .
time out .
i thought the mission today was to get you your first tuna .
why does everything have to be a mission ?
our goal was to help you catch an eye .
there &apos;s no goal , there &apos;s no mission .
we are just fishing .
what that means is , we relax , we have a couple of laughs .
maybe we catch a fish , maybe we do not .
all right , well , this right here-- this is called
sitting on a boat and not catching anything ,
just so you know .
fine , okay , well , that &apos;s where the beer comes in .
few laughs , pretend we &apos;re friends .
right ?
that &apos;s all .
salud .
salud .
all right , what now ?
what now ?
we talk , you know , shoot the breeze .
okay , shoot .
uh , any word on your mother ?
no , she &apos;s still on the island somewhere .
doing what ?
i don &apos;t know , i got lines out .
one of those lines catherine ?
maybe .
that &apos;s good , your girlfriend checking up on your mother .
that , that should turn out very well .
okay , first of all ,
she &apos;s not my girlfriend ,
and second of all , she &apos;s not checking on my mother .
she using her contacts in naval intel
to locate my mother .
okay , nobody &apos;s going to know .
oh , n @-@ no , no , no , y @-@ your mother is a spy and a woman .
she will know , trust me .
that &apos;s a good point .
let me ask you another question .
what is it with navy seals ?
they &apos;re not allowed to have girlfriends ?
i mean , how would you characterize your relationship ?
well , we-- i mean , she &apos;s-- w @-@ we have a thing .
a thing , yes , you have a thing .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
it &apos;s called a girlfriend , who , by the way ,
you &apos;re asking to spy on your mother .
not spy-- locate , danny .
okay .
spy , locate-- they &apos;re different .
you have any idea where she &apos;s at ?
no idea at all .
i &apos;m doing everything i can to find her ,
but , you know , my mother was a highly trained spy
for 20 years and she managed to stay hidden that whole time ,
so she &apos;s not gonna make it easy for us .
what about your sister ?
i mean , i haven &apos;t told her .
what am i gonna say ? i haven &apos;t told her yet .
that should be an interesting conversation .
okay , okay , set the hook .
okay .
set the hook , danny , jam it ... all right , set .
okay , set the hook , set it .
i got it .
i &apos;m setting it , i &apos;m setting it .
set the hook !
release the drag a little bit .
all right ,
would you stop with the backseat fishing ?
okay , just keep the pressure on .
stop !
can i have something of my own ?
get the gaff .
keep the pressure on it .
just get the gaff .
all right , good job .
i got it !
i see color , i see color , danny .
it &apos;s a tuna , buddy .
hey , tuny .
it &apos;s a tuna !
it &apos;s a tuny fish , you son of a tuny fish !
a tuna , danny .
all right , go ahead , take another one .
you got to smile .
i &apos;m not going to smile .
that &apos;s not very manly .
come on .
i know a guy
who stuffs and mounts these .
you know , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m
a dead @-@ fish @-@ on @-@ the- wall kind of guy .
this is gonna be dinner , i &apos;m gonna have
kamekona cook us up a feast .
it &apos;s gonna be great .
what ?
look at that .
what ?
it &apos;s a boat .
a boat in the ocean-- go figure .
it &apos;s a guy in a dinghy .
he looks like he &apos;s in trouble .
hey , hey , over here !
all right , we &apos;re gonna go take a look .
hey , buddy , you okay ?
boy , i &apos;m glad to see you guys .
what happened ?
i ran out of gas .
here , we &apos;ll give you a ride , all right ?
that would be awesome .
grab that .
all right .
hey , looks like you &apos;re bleeding .
what happened , buddy , you cut yourself ?
yeah , yeah , uh , trying to fix the motor .
tiny little dinghy like that is not exactly designed
for open water like this .
what were you doing out this far ?
i need to borrow your boat .
hey , hey , hey , listen to me ,
you don &apos;t want to do this , trust me .
i said i need to borrow your boat .
i am not going to ask twice .
you have two seconds
to jump in the water ,
or one of you is gonna be shark chum .
now !
danny , i need you to hold this right here .
hold it tight .
let go .
it &apos;s all right ?
that should slow the leak .
how much time is this going to buy us ?
i don &apos;t know.that &apos;s not gonna hold forever .
we &apos;re in a boat , a leaky boat .
sounds like sinking to me , steve .
technically it &apos;s a dinghy ,
but we &apos;re not sinking , okay ?
i stand corrected .
we are stranded in a slowly leaking dinghy .
we &apos;re not stranded .
hey , steve , i don &apos;t know if you noticed ,
but we &apos;re in the middle of the ocean , okay ?
how , how is that not stranded ?
are you done ?
no , i &apos;m not done .
in fact , i haven &apos;t got started yet ,
and as of today , i am done helping people in boats ,
specifically ones with guns .
okay , i have been there
and i have done that .
okay , i &apos;m sorry about the gun .
i didn &apos;t see the gun ,
but i thought the guy was in trouble .
he was in trouble , steve ,
and now he &apos;s not &apos; cause he &apos;s got our boat .
you owe me a cell phone .
why don &apos;t you sit there and keep complaining
while i figure a way out of this ?
all right ?
fine .
just please do me one little favor
and tell me we have gas , please .
negative , we do not have gas .
why did you do that ?
it was busted .
you could have fixed it .
you could have snapped some
technical navy seal know @-@ how on it and fixed it .
maybe ,
but we were out of gas , okay ,
and it was weighing us down .
but we have rope .
martha stewart , please do me a favor .
tell me how macram is going to help save us right now .
i &apos;m tying a tow rope .
oh , good , &apos; cause now all we need is a tow
or a phone to call one with .
just tell me which way is land .
that way .
this way .
what are you doing ?
what am i doing ? i &apos;m exercising .
what does it look like i &apos;m doing ?
i &apos;m paddling .
save your energy ; i &apos;m gonna tow us .
okay ? how are you gonna tow us ?
we are miles away from land .
just relax , danny , i &apos;ve done it before .
oh , you &apos;ve done it before ?
oh , i see , &apos; cause you like this , huh ?
this is fun for you .
you enjoy this . this is a challenge for you , right ?
a skills test .
be all you can be and all that crap .
that &apos;s the army .
all right .
hold on .
just stop for one second .
what am i going to do ?
this is what you do .
i want you to bail .
okay .
take this .
bail .
okay , but hol @-@ hold .
uh , it &apos;s a dinghy , right , so , like , it can &apos;t sink .
just bail .
think of it as busywork to keep your mind off the situation .
what &apos;s the situation ? there is no situation .
we &apos;re gonna be fine , just trust me .
trust you , trust you , trust you .
hey , i was happy sitting at home on my couch in my underwear ,
watching the jets , okay , but , no ,
you wanted me to catch a tunny fish .
you got to admit , it was just a little bit fun
reeling in that big fish , though , huh ?
huh ? yes , it was .
wasn &apos;t it good ?
it was fun , it was fun .
but the , uh , the boatjacking-- not so much fun .
start bailing .
what the hell was that ?
what ?
something just bumped into the boat-- sorry ,
the dinghy .
what do you mean , something ?
something .
steve , there &apos;s something in the water .
there &apos;s something out there .
come on , come on !
get in the boat . what are you doing ? come on .
steve , it &apos;s a shark !
get out of the water !
come on , come on , hurry up !
mcgarrett . leave a message .
steve , it &apos;s catherine .
i &apos;m at the club .
where are you ?
come on , steve ,
it &apos;s right behind you , get in the boat !
now , steve , now , right now . get in the boat !
come on , come on !
it &apos;s a dinghy
dinghy , huh ?
even in the face of death , you are annoying .
where &apos;d he go ? whoa .
that &apos;s a tiger shark , man .
tiger shark ?
yeah .
oh , no big deal , then , right ?
have you seen shark week ?
i don &apos;t want to be on shark week .
all right , if that thing gets near you ,
you punch it in the nose .
trust me .
i &apos;m not gonna punch it in the nose .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to do .
otherwise it eats your hands .
i &apos;m telling you , i know this stuff .
not gonna disrespect this animal by provoking it .
please , please don &apos;t get all island on me now , okay ?
besides , i &apos;m cramping up bad , man .
i need a rest .
right now we take a break , we wait .
wait , wait for what ?
for the huge tiger shark to go away , danny .
then we stick to the plan .
trust me , it &apos;s going to be a long wait .
what , you &apos;re a shark expert now ?
no , i am an expert on mcgarrett , the danger magnet .
oh , this is my fault ?
who else on the planet earth
could turn a nice , relaxing day of fishing
into a boatjacking and a shark encounter ?
i &apos;m a danger magnet ?
let me tell you something . it &apos;s your negative attitude .
oh , i see . i see .
so the shark could sense my negative attitude ?
sharks can sense fear , just like dogs .
we are in a leaking dinghy in the middle of the ocean .
of course i &apos;m scared !
hey , it &apos;s water , danny . it &apos;s just water .
with tiger sharks
and riptides and all kinds of other stuff to make you dead .
not everybody &apos;s a navy seal , steve .
seriously , danny , what is your problem with the ocean ?
i mean , who hates water ?
60 % of the human body is water !
well , that explains why i hate people , all right ?
you are at the top of my list .
yeah , right now , i &apos;m thinking that shark would be better company .
then go . then go swimming with the tiger shark .
but do me a favor . if he comes near you , punch him .
i do not want to be the one
to tell your sister you ended up man sushi .
no one &apos;s gonna be man sushi .
the ocean is fine , the ocean is safe
as long as you know what you &apos;re doing .
you know , i used to love the ocean , okay ?
i went to wildwood every single summer of my life .
my parents would rent a summer house there .
this one summer , my best friend ,
billy selway , he comes with us .
and we had this competition thing going .
everything-- frisbee , uh , football ,
baseball , anything , you name it .
so one day , we ... we decide
to swim out to the buoy and back .
halfway out there , i get stuck in this really bad riptide ,
and i ... i start to panic .
so billy sees me and he starts to head out to me , but then ,
halfway out to me , something happens .
he gets stuck in this undertow , and , uh ,
one minute he &apos;s there , one minute ... he &apos;s gone .
i &apos;m sorry , man .
found his body three miles down the coast .
and i &apos;ve ... i &apos;ve not told that story in a very long time .
took me moving to hawaii
with my daughter to even get back in the ocean again ,
so that is why ...
i don &apos;t like the water , okay ?
oh , oh . what is that ?
what is that ?
it &apos;s a yacht .
sure it &apos;s not a dinghy ?
you &apos;re a funny guy .
ho ! over here !
mcgarrett . leave a message .
hey , any luck ?
nobody at the marina &apos;s seen them , and
they aren &apos;t answering their cell phones , either .
okay , how late are they ?
i was supposed to pick them up about three hours ago ,
so , i &apos;m officially worried .
were you able to triangulate their cell phones ?
no . both their signals are dead , nonfunctioning .
did they say where they were going ?
the only thing i could get out of steve was
that it was some secret spot
that his father used to take him to .
he wanted to get danny his first tuna .
so , they took my uncle &apos;s boat ,
which means i should be able to get a location off the gps .
got it .
that &apos;s odd .
didn &apos;t steve ask you to pick him up
at the south shore sailing club ?
yeah . why ?
according to the gps ,
the boat &apos;s docked on the north shore .
what are they doing there ?
that &apos;s it over there .
i &apos;ll go talk to the dockmaster .
all right .
steve ? danny ?
they wouldn &apos;t leave these behind .
looks like they caught something
so we know they were out fishing .
chin ?
that looks like blood .
whose shirt is this ? steve &apos;s ? danny &apos;s ?
it could be steve &apos;s . i &apos;m not sure .
might not belong to either of them .
but that looks fresh .
we need to check all the local hospitals .
i &apos;ll call crime scene down here ,
have them go over every inch of this boat
and figure out what happened .
all right . so the dockmaster said
that the boat was already docked when he got back from lunch .
any way of finding out who got off of it ?
no .
lightning strike took out the security cameras last week .
well , it doesn &apos;t make sense that
they would bring the boat back to shore and then disappear .
maybe they didn &apos;t .
hello !
hello !
doesn &apos;t look like anybody &apos;s on there .
hello !
i think this dinghy belongs to this boat .
looks like our boatjacker was on board .
what kind of an idiot would leave this nice boat
and go out in the open ocean in that miserable dinghy ?
danny .
that &apos;s why .
that blood &apos;s fresh .
i got more blood .
he &apos;s dead .
answers why our jacker was in the dinghy .
he was fleeing a crime scene .
looks like our victim was shot three times , close range .
i got a nine millimeter .
same caliber as our boatjacker .
what are you doing , man ? it &apos;s a crime scene .
oh , excuse me . i will be sure to pack latex gloves
next time we go on a fishing trip .
just preserve the crime scene . just ... just ...
okay , okay , it &apos;s preserved .
all right , skipper ?
please go up there and get this thing started .
let &apos;s cruise back to shore ,
let &apos;s let the crime lab take a look .
that is a great idea .
thank you .
i &apos;m thinking that &apos;s not good .
no , it &apos;s not good .
what about the radio ?
it &apos;s dead .
maybe it just shorted out .
the rest of the boat &apos;s got power .
i got to check the engines .
lift that up .
all right . both of these engines are seized .
please tell me you can unseize them .
i &apos;m gonna see what i can do .
so we &apos;re still stranded ?
yeah , but the good news is ,
we &apos;re stranded on a nicer boat .
that is true .
with a dead guy and no radio ,
but it is a nicer boat .
this is my fault , too ?
i &apos;m just saying .
you &apos;re saying .
just got lab results back on the blood
recovered from the shirt you found on the boat .
it doesn &apos;t belong to either mcgarrett or danny .
good .
okay . did you run it through codis ?
i did , but no hits .
any prints on the boat ?
pulled a latent print off the boat &apos;s boarding ladder
that came back to a guy named gil scates .
does he have a record ?
no .
then why are his prints in the system ?
gil scates worked with safe house security .
he was employed as a security guard there .
so , i contacted the company and found out
that he was recently terminated for improper conduct .
do me a favor .
hold that .
let me ask you a question .
what ?
can you actually fix this ,
or is this , uh , more busywork , like bailing ?
what did i say to you ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m doing my best .
i got to figure out why
both of the water intake lines have failed ,
causing the engines to overheat .
i @-@ i ... i don &apos;t understand .
expensive boat .
yeah , it &apos;s got all the bells and whistles ,
but sometimes these new propulsion engines--
they can be tricky , you know ?
did you , uh , take another look at the body ?
yeah .
i pulled the guy &apos;s wallet .
his name is al burgess .
boat registration is in his name , too .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re dealing with a master criminal here .
no . the shooting was very sloppy .
i got two slugs lodged in the wall .
you think it was self @-@ defense then ?
maybe . i &apos;m thinking , uh , he gets cold feet ,
he starts to shoot impulsively .
then he realizes he actually has to finish the job .
does , comes out here , tries to get the boat running ,
panics when it won &apos;t start ,
jumps in the dinghy .
doesn &apos;t realize how far out he is .
yeah , he runs out of gas
before he knows he &apos;s in trouble .
yeah . then he sees us .
says , &quot; bing , perfect , i &apos;m saved .
all i got to do is take these guys &apos; boat . &quot;
gil scates !
five @-@ o !
clear .
clear .
clear .
clear .
check this out .
looks like gil was in the market for a boat .
he &apos;s got everything here but boating for dummies .
not just any boat . a 38 @-@ foot yacht .
pretty pricey boat for an unemployed security guard .
unpaid utility bills .
maybe he was planning on stealing one ,
and this is his homework .
okay . so , what was he doing with your uncle &apos;s boat ?
you know , seems like a step down .
i mean , everything here is about this one kind of boat .
mcgarrett and danny &apos;s fishing trip
must have interrupted his plans .
so , steve , what do you think--
we getting home before hanukkah ?
hey ! over here !
oh , thanks god !
oh , yes !
steve , get up here !
it &apos;s the coast guard . about time .
huh ? what did i tell you ?
trust me .
prepare to be boarded and stand down .
okay .
interlace your fingers , put your hands behind your head .
oh , no . we &apos;re , uh , five @-@ o. we &apos;re cops .
show me your badges .
we don &apos;t have our badges with us .
yeah . get your hands behind your head .
now !
okay . all right .
we &apos;ve got a dead body below deck , sir .
uh , i can explain that .
you &apos;re under arrest .
anything you say can
and will be used against you in a court of law .
we know . okay . we know our rights .
this is awesome .
what else wrong do you think could happen ?
maybe , if we &apos;re lucky , they &apos;ll have a trial at sea
and they &apos;ll make us walk the plank .
just relax .
hey , there ain &apos;t going to be too many more relaxes , okay ?
look at it like this :
you &apos;re going to have a great story to tell grace one day .
and the moral of that story is this :
never go deep @-@ sea fishing with a navy seal .
no , no , scratch that .
never go fishing with you .
should &apos;ve used you for bait .
sorry for the misunderstanding ,
commander mcgarrett , detective williams .
member of your team verified your credentials .
well , next time i get forced into the ocean at gunpoint ,
i &apos;ll be sure to have my credentials .
captain , the yacht-- was it reported stolen ?
missing . the owner &apos;s wife called ,
worried when her husband hadn &apos;t returned .
maybe it had something to do with him being shot .
again , i apologize .
there &apos;s been a rash of boatjackings lately .
we suspect tongan pirates ,
so as soon as we got the call about the boat ,
we just figured they were behind it .
this guy was working alone .
soon as we return to port ,
we &apos;re going to hand this investigation over to your team , okay ?
i appreciate it .
steve , i was so worried .
hey , i &apos;m fine .
we were fine .
we were lucky to find that boat , but we were fine .
we were not fine , okay ?
tell her about the shark .
tell him about the shark .
sharks ?
a shark-- there was one shark .
it wasn &apos;t a big deal .
of course , it was a big deal .
what are you talking about ?
it was a big deal . trust me .
we &apos;re back on dry land .
we &apos;re safe and sound . why we do what ...
you know , you two need to spend some time apart .
i agree .
i mean , it &apos;s ...
commander mcgarrett ,
detective williams ,
good to have you two back .
it &apos;s good to be back
on dry land .
unguent ?
excuse me ?
it &apos;s cream for your sunburn .
it contains aloe .
as you know , aloe is naturally soothing
to the irritated skin and sunburn .
if you need assistance applying it to your affected areas ,
then i &apos;m more than happy ...
no , no , i ...
thank you . i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m very gentle .
i bet .
apply liberally .
all right .
uh , the victim is below deck , aft cabin .
okay , we preserved the crime scene .
his name is al burgess .
matches the photo his wife sent over .
you said you got something on the suspect .
the guy &apos;s name is gil scates .
we managed to pull his print off the boat .
that &apos;s him . that &apos;s our boatjacker .
he &apos;s an unemployed security guard .
when we searched his apartment ,
we found operator &apos;s manuals for a yacht .
we think he might have been planning to steal this boat .
yeah , well , he botched that , too .
okay , we find any connection between
al burgess and gil scates ?
i got kono asking
al &apos;s wife that very question .
excuse me . katie burgess ?
yes .
officer kono kalakaua .
uh , may we please speak in private ?
i &apos;m jenny . i &apos;m al &apos;s sister .
i asked jenny to come when i heard .
i hope that &apos;s okay .
of course .
i got so worried when he wouldn &apos;t answer my calls .
when did you notify the coast guard ?
last night .
this is all my fault .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t understand .
i wanted him to sell the yacht .
we never used it .
it wasn &apos;t even his idea to buy it in the first place .
my brother didn &apos;t even know how to swim .
i never told him that
i wanted a yacht , jenny .
did he say anyone was interested ?
yes , a potential buyer .
did he mention a name ?
not that i can remember .
we have reason to believe that this man
was on the boat with your husband .
what ? this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
do you know him ?
yes .
he worked for the security company in this neighborhood ,
and we &apos;ve had some problems with him .
can you be more specific ?
a couple of months ago ,
he made inappropriate advances when my husband was away on business .
he was stalking her .
he followed her car .
one night , i caught him looking in the windows .
what did you do ?
i told my husband .
and he called the security company
and he got him fired .
but this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
this guy &apos;s not going to kill al
just because you told someone that he was a pervert .
why would your husband take him out
on the boat after getting him fired ?
i don &apos;t know .
did your husband know what gil looked like ?
not that i know of .
al was away on business
when all this happened .
he only knew his name .
okay , um ...
do you think
that gil did this to get back at us ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to find out .
so , i just reached out
to safe house security and found out
that the burgesses filed three complaints
over the last two months , all against gil scates .
those charges actually got him dismissed .
his supervisor says he was pretty hot about the termination .
okay , maybe scates wasn &apos;t trying to steal the boat
and the wife was right .
maybe gil was trying to get back at al for having him fired .
well , according to kono ,
katie burgess said her husband
didn &apos;t know what scates looked like ,
so yeah , that &apos;s possible .
okay , so al burgess places an ad
for the boat in the advertiser .
right , and gil comes in , calls
and , posing as a potential buyer ,
takes him out to the ocean
and puts a bullet in him .
right .
he probably would &apos;ve taken the boat ,
but the boat &apos;s not working .
despite everything ,
he still manages to get away with it .
no , wait a minute-- so he thinks .
scates doesn &apos;t know that danny and i are alive
and found that crime scene .
if gil believes he got away with murder ,
he &apos;s going to try and blend back in like nothing ever happened .
and that &apos;s how we &apos;re going to get him .
are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
when you &apos;re ready ...
i &apos;ll come over and help with her things .
thanks , cuz .
how are things with adam ?
i haven &apos;t seen him for a week .
uh , he &apos;s on a business trip .
what sort of business ?
he &apos;s trying to legitimize his father &apos;s business .
that doesn &apos;t happen overnight .
is that what he &apos;s telling you ?
adam &apos;s a good guy , chin .
look , i know how you feel about him ,
and i know what he did for us ,
but his father was the head of the yakuza .
it &apos;s the family business .
if things get ugly , you are a liability to him .
a liability ?
what are you talking about ?
&apos;cause adam saved my life ,
so he &apos;s never going to let
whatever you &apos;re talking about happen .
it &apos;s not adam i &apos;m worried about .
i &apos;m going to get a coffee .
you want one ?
look , look ...
i &apos;m sorry .
five @-@ o ! freeze !
chin ?
chin !
kono !
hold on , cuz .
hang tight .
chin !
hurry !
chin !
come on !
come on !
what took so long ?
i &apos;m begging you , please ,
i need a reason . give me one good reason
why i shouldn &apos;t bust you in your jaw right now
sitting in that chair .
look , i didn &apos;t know you guys were cops .
oh , okay .
what would you have done differently , genius ?
shot us instead of the boat ?
i have a fellow law enforcement brother .
i have mad respect for you guys .
shut up .
you are an out @-@ of @-@ work rent @-@ a @-@ cop .
all right , and you got fired for peeping in windows .
i didn &apos;t do that .
stop .
we are way past pretending here .
your fingerprints are all over the boat .
al burgess got you fired for
snooping on his wife ,
so you lured him out there
and you killed him in cold blood .
we argued over the price of the boat ,
okay .
and he attacked me .
it was self @-@ defense .
you are an unemployed security guard .
you are three months behind on the rent .
you could not afford a dinghy ,
let alone that boat .
we know you didn &apos;t go out there to buy that boat ,
so tell us what the hell &apos;s going on .
hey , i just finished processing al &apos;s boat .
the water intake valves were intentionally damaged .
okay , why would scates sabotage the boat
if he was trying to steal it ?
i don &apos;t know .
but the damage would have gone unnoticed
until they were several miles off shore ,
at which point the engine
would have overheated and seized up .
someone set him up .
i &apos;m thinking that someone could be katie burgess .
our vic &apos;s wife ?
well , she was the only other person with access to the boat .
look into both of them .
there &apos;s got to be a connection that we &apos;re missing .
all right , you got it .
gil , there was no self @-@ defense .
you deliberately went out on that boat to kill al burgess .
it was revenge for losing your job .
see , we know everything .
no .
no , you don &apos;t .
hey , you guys are gonna want to hear this .
all right , so , our suspect and katie burgess were in on it together .
what &apos;s the link ?
good old @-@ fashioned greed .
i ran al burgess &apos;s phone , and the last call
katie &apos;s husband made was to a local law firm .
let me guess .
he was gonna divorce her .
yep , and according to the suits ,
the prenup would &apos;ve left her with nothing .
okay , so that &apos;s where gil comes in .
i swear , the prenup , it should be banned .
okay ? it &apos;s killed more guys than cancer .
i &apos;d recheck those statistics if i were you .
so katie stood to inherit millions from her husband &apos;s death .
minus whatever she offered gil to do the job .
unless gil wasn &apos;t in it for just the money .
hey , gil , it &apos;s pretty bad luck
getting stuck miles offshore with burgess &apos;s body .
i tried to get the boat going .
i don &apos;t know what happened .
so , yeah , it was bad luck .
turns out luck had nothing to do with the boat not working .
somebody sabotaged that engine
and made sure that radio wasn &apos;t gonna work .
what ?
i mean , it was pretty perfect , you being stuck out there with that body .
it &apos;s what they call a patsy .
patsy .
what &apos;s a patsy ?
well , if you have to ask ...
we think you were set up .
you &apos;re wasting your time .
no , somebody talked you into killing burgess
and then made sure you were stranded out there .
you &apos;re lying .
no , no , i &apos;ll let you see the crime lab report .
the only way you were supposed to get off of that boat
after killing al was in handcuffs .
and there was only one other person who
had access to that boat , right ?
katie burgess .
i am curious as to how she sold it to you .
uh , i mean , what did she say ?
she says , &quot; you take care of my husband ,
&quot; and then we will sail off into the sunset together ,
live happily ever after &quot; ?
you weren &apos;t in love with her , were you ?
oh , you were .
okay , that &apos;s understandable .
love definitely makes you do some crazy things .
marriage , mortgage , kids .
i personally would draw the line at murder ,
but i am not a romantic like you , gilbert .
katie wouldn &apos;t do that .
you &apos;re willing to bet the rest of your life in jail on that ?
yes ?
katie , i need to see you .
the cops just left my house ,
and they were asking a lot of questions .
i think i bought myself some time ,
but i don &apos;t know how long .
i want to turn myself in .
i want to ... i &apos;m gonna tell them it was self @-@ defense .
gil , listen to me .
of course the police are going to be looking at you .
they &apos;re just ... doing their job .
as long as you didn &apos;t leave any evidence behind ,
you &apos;ll be fine .
now stick ...
to the plan ,
and don &apos;t call me again .
you got it ?
jenny .
who was that ?
whoa ! hey ! five @-@ o !
drop the weapon right now .
right now .
put it down . i &apos;m telling you to put it down .
jenny , listen to him .
she killed my brother .
she &apos;s dead .
okay , the moment you &apos;ve been waiting for .
feast &apos;s up ! everybody dig in !
danny &apos;s first tuna .
right .
and last , my fishing career is over .
forever ?
with you , yes .
ouch .
but perhaps you &apos;d enjoy bonefishing .
bonefishing ?
that , uh , that doesn &apos;t sound creepy , max .
what is that , you and your cut @-@ up @-@ dead people buddies do what ?
o &apos;io , as they are called here .
they &apos;re the number one saltwater game fish .
you fly fish for them in saltwater flats--
it &apos;s quite relaxing .
does it involve
sinking dinghies , boatjacking ,
or tiger sharks ?
it &apos;s a ... bit more elegant than deep @-@ sea fishing .
i took kamekona last week .
and i barfed the whole time .
okay , there you go
someone who dislikes the water as much as i do .
no , no , no . i love the ocean .
i just got sick of pulling
those hooks out of those poor little fishies .
yeah , i hear ya .
hey , that was my job when you were a kid .
hey , it wasn &apos;t &apos; cause i was scared , cuz .
i let you do it ,
&apos;cause you wanted to take care of me .
i still do .
aw ... that is sweet .
that is so sweet .
to billy selway .
billy selway .
all right , enough talking , it &apos;s poke time .
i was waiting . i was waiting . let &apos;s go .
that &apos;s excellent .
this is excellent . this is awesome . it is really good .
you sure ?
i &apos;m absolutely positive .
it &apos;s really good .
i &apos;ll leave this with you , then .
what is this ?
it &apos;s a bill .
i see that it &apos;s a bill , but why are you giving it to me ?
i brought you a fish-- what are you charging me for ?
my cooking services .
what ?
superior life skills .
what is that ,
like a corkage fee ?
exactly .
oh , cooking what ? what &apos;d you cook ? it &apos;s raw fish .
you didn &apos;t cook anything .
all right , you brought me fish ,
i gave you a meal .
what are you looking at me for ?
i told you to get it stuffed .
oh , so you put him up to this ?
no , i didn &apos;t put him up to it .
it &apos;s pretty good , though .
good , then you can pay for half of it .
cash is good . i don &apos;t take credit .
to danno &apos;s first fish .
drink to that .
