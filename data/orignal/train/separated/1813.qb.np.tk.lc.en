today we visit the survivors--
their patients , their triumphs ,
and their disappointments .
this is &lt; i &gt; seattle medical , road to recovery &lt; / i &gt; .
things have changed since the shooting , sure .
for one thing , uh , over the last month ,
外科主任
we have installed a number of new , uh , security measures .
um , we &apos;re trying to make it safer for the hospital ,
uh , the doctors , and-- and-- and the patients .
so what-- what--

his blood pressure &apos;s dropping .
uh , sure , i mean , going through something like that ,
it &apos;s brought us closer .
not that we weren &apos;t close before .
i mean , ask anyone . we &apos;re close .
yeah , dr. yang and my wife sometimes have sleepovers ...
in my bed with me in it .
so yeah , yes , it &apos;s brought us closer for sure .

外科住院医生
they check on the patients and report to me
before i check on the patients and report to my attending .
lily , i told you already ,
turn it down or put in the headphones .
the rest of us don &apos;t have bieber fever ,
whatever that is .
how have i changed since the shooting ?
i don &apos;t know .
uh , i got this .
uh , today i &apos;m going back to seattle grace
for my colostomy reversal .
病人
oh , uh , babe , did we remember my robe and my fuzzy socks ?
玛丽的丈夫
yes , and yes ,
if by &quot; we , &quot; you mean me , because you forgot .
i was supposed to get this surgery months ago ,
but ... well , the shooting happened instead .
did you get the parking ticket ?
yeah , in my pocket .
i haven &apos;t been back to the hospital since that day .
i don &apos;t know how it will feel to be back .
that &apos;s right , it &apos;s portman . p- o @-@ r @-@ t @-@ m @-@ a @-@ n .
uh , and can you tell me where i can get this validated ?
i &apos;ll take care of it .
thanks .
普外科医生
hey .
hey , dr. b.
yeah , i don &apos;t generally make it a habit
to hug my patients .
yeah , well , when you get paged 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1,
you don &apos;t walk . you never walk .
儿科医生
okay , talk .
okay .
持续缺氧两分钟她就会死亡
god , i can &apos;t get past the obstruction .
damn it . how long ?
five minutes .
damn it .
yes . yes , do it now .
no , no , no , lily , lily ,
i know . i know . this is scary . you stopped breathing ,
and so we had to take you to the o.r.
and put a tube in your neck to help get you air .
no , no , no . you can &apos;t talk , okay ?
but we called your mom at work , and she &apos;s on her way .
lily was admitted with respiratory distress last night .
she has a , uh , growth on her windpipe .
it &apos;s benign except for , there &apos;s nothing benign
about something that &apos;s blocking your airway .
she &apos;s had surgeries to remove it in the past ,
but it &apos;s aggressive , it keeps recurring ,
and obviously , it &apos;s gotten worse , much worse .
okay , this is the nurse &apos;s button .
if you need anything , you push it .
i mean push it a lot . don &apos;t worry about being annoying .
push it till they come in here .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s all right .
here .
not too loud , okay ?
it happens more than you think ,
having to do a procedure on a kid with no parents around .
some of these kids are in here for weeks .
the parents usually can &apos;t take off that much work .
but i mean , we try to help out .
we have these beds , we call &apos; em parent cots ,
for the parents to sleep in .
but a lot of these kids spend a lot of time alone .
just works out that way .
doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re bad parents .
they &apos;re just , uh , busy parents .
i found out last night that he ...
had been in an accident .
手臂捐献者的妻子
just before the phone rang , i had this ...
sinking feeling .
motorcycles ...
donorcycles-- isn &apos;t that what they call them ?
故人们戏称其为 &quot; donorcycle &quot;
they called me in here because even though sam &apos;s a donor ,
they need special consent for something like this .
i know sam would want to donate whatever he could ,
so of course , yes , they-- they could ...
they could take his arms .
absolutely . i have no problem with that .
although , uh ...
it &apos;s hard , you k--
the thought of somebody else , you know ,
holding his hand .
see that ? that could be a problem .
what if we try a bypass instead ?
derek and i ? we go way back .
we grew up together , went to med school together .
he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s kinda like my better half .
not the better @-@ looking half , mind you .
so when i heard he got shot ...
every day , we give bad news to patients .
we tell them their loved ones are hurt ...
or dying ...
or dead .
and for the first time in my life ,
i understood what that feels like .
it feels like .
no , no , you &apos;re thinking like a nerve guy .
i am a nerve guy .
goes blood supply , then nerves .
actually , it &apos;s tendons ,
then blood supply , then nerves .
um , hello , what about the bones ?
矫形外科医生
we estimate the surgery will take
anywhere from 15 to 20 hours .
we &apos;ll have two o.r.s going at once .
there will be five teams of surgeons ,
one team for each arm ,
and then a fifth just to harvest veins from the leg .
you know there &apos;s only been one successful
bilateral arm transplant in the country ?
in the world .
in the world .
yeah , i wouldn &apos;t go so far as , uh , calling us medical titans ,
but ... we are .
not the first time i &apos;ve been called a titan .
right now ,
i am prepping the donor body
to extract antibodies from his blood .
this is all in preparation for later ,
when we &apos;ll remove , uh , bone marrow from the donor ,
and then we &apos;ll infuse the marrow into zack
to reduce the chances of his body rejecting the arms ,
which is huge .
more than huge .
i mean , i &apos;m no medical titan , but , uh ...
still it &apos;s pretty damn cool .
uh , yeah , zack lost his arms four years ago .
it was an accident at work .
he is , uh , he was a logger .
so it coulda gone either way .
i mean , it-- this thing coulda come between us
or it could &apos;ve brought us closer together ,
and for us ...
i think it &apos;s brought us closer .
literally . i have to wipe his for him .
okay , really ?
that &apos;s the way you want to talk about
in front of everyone right now ?
yeah , i do .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;d cover my face , but i don &apos;t have any hands .
you been good since i last saw you ?
busy .
bill and i left town right after the shooting ,
and ... pretty much never looked back .
so far , we &apos;ve been to paris ,
morocco , alaska ...
a cruise through the baltic .
what ?
blew through our savings ,
but ... hey , life is short , right ?
sure is .
is there anything i &apos;m looking forward to
once my surgery is done ?
babies .
lots and lots of babies .
deep breath .
another .
enter security access code .
you &apos;re sure ? you &apos;re sure ?
i &apos;m sure . i &apos;m sure . i &apos;m sure . i &apos;m sure . i &apos;m sure .
enter security access code .
there are some kinks with the new security system ,
but-- but there are always kinks with something ...
n @-@ new . ah .
but we &apos;re-- we &apos;re working them out .
we got this , uh , new , state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art
like , lockdown system .
to isolate different areas of the hospital in case of an emergency .
yeah , &apos; cause , um supposedly , the last emergency ,
there were ... some people wandering around .
even with the kinks , i think people feel safer ,
which is important , yeah .
uh , sorry to interrupt , chief .
i just-- i got your page , but hey , i can come back .
oh , nonsense .
congratulations . i just heard the big news ,
and i am so proud of you .
uh , our very own , um , dr. robbins here
has been award
the prestigious , um , carter madison grant .
yeah , i haven &apos;t told that many people yet .
a carter @-@ madison grant ? nobody wins those .
i mean , nobody normal . i mean , just sort of
those brainy , scientist types who are from germany and sweden .
oh , my god ! you won ! are you kidding ?
nope . she &apos;s not kidding .
oh , come here .
thank you .
no , i didn &apos;t apply for the grant because of the shooting .
there are major gaps
in the care of children in developing countries .
global health initiatives exist for things like malaria ,
uh , infectious diseases , immunizations ,
but not for pediatric surgery ,
and with this grant ...
i could start to change that .
well , i applied for this thing two years ago .
i was a completely different person .
you know , i was new here , um , a surgical fellow ...
single .
but now i have people here ,
important people , which ...
complicates things .
but ... this is bigger than me .
this is-- this is the opportunity of a lifetime .
so ...
yeah ,
of course i &apos;m accepting the grant .
that just means i &apos;m ... moving to africa .
coming up on &lt; i &gt; seattle medical &lt; / i &gt; ... how long has he been coding ? !
um , dr. torres , have you seen this ?
oh , no . oh , no , no , no , no , no .
something like this could ruin everything .
well , i mean , not just anyone &apos;s a good arm donation candidate .
not every candidate wants donated arms .
most , uh , amputee patients opt to continue using prosthetics .
when you think about it ,
we &apos;re attaching two cadaver arms
to another living person &apos;s body .
that &apos;s the kind of thing
that could really mess with someone &apos;s head .
not to mention the rehabilitation time .
recovering from something like this , it takes years .
well , the screening process is , uh , extensive .
we have to ensure that the recipient
is stable mentally and physically ,
determined , patient , very patient .
and that &apos;s all before you even begin looking for an arm .
uh , in this case , we &apos;ve been looking for arms for zachary
for over two years .
it &apos;s been a long time coming .
um , dr. torres .
uh , you &apos;ve probably seen this ,
but-- but h @-@ have you seen this ?
oh , my god . no .
oh , no . oh , no , no , no , no , no .
okay , um , page sloan right now .
a tattoo ?
it &apos;s just so unfair that something like this
外科住院医生
外科住院医生
could ruin everything .
hi . is it true ?
are you guys scrubbing in on the ...
外科住院医生
double arm transplant ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
nothing .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
it &apos;s a very real concern , actually .
the patient could easily reject the arms ,
not just physically but emotionally .
the first @-@ ever hand transplant recipient
ultimately asked to have the hand removed .
yeah , he said he couldn &apos;t connect to it ,
that it felt like dead weight sewn on to his body ,
that the hand wasn &apos;t and never would be his .
imagine looking at a tattoo of your donor &apos;s wife &apos;s name
every day to remind you that these aren &apos;t your arms .
you &apos;re making me nervous . what &apos;s wrong ?
is there a problem with the arms ?
oh , god . there &apos;s a problem with the arms .
maybe .
there &apos;s a tattoo on one of the arms
of the name &quot; nicole . &quot;
i love the name nicole .
me , too . i love it . we couldn &apos;t love it more .
i say we rename our dog nicole .
i &apos;m gonna name myself nicole .
change my name .
if it means i can still get those arms ,
then ... nicole is my new favorite name .
yeah .
i was-- i was not expecting that .
he got that tattoo exactly one year after we met .
he took me to the tattoo shop and told me
he was gonna get this tattoo
to show me just how much he loved me , which ...
is when i &apos;m pretty sure i called him an idiot or something worse .
you don &apos;t declare your love for someone by getting a tattoo .
you do normal things , like--
like plan a nice date , or-- or write a poem ,
or hell , drop down on one knee and propose .
you don &apos;t brand yourself with another person &apos;s name .
which is when sam said , &quot; okay , &quot;
and he got down on one knee ,
pulled out a ring and proposed ...
on the spot .
after that , every time ...
even if we were fighting
or i was mad at him because he forgot to take the garbage cans out or ...
i &apos;d catch a glimpse of that tattoo ,
and i &apos;d remember , this guy loves me .
even if the garbage is gonna smell up the yard for a week ...
he loves me .
loved me .
i don &apos;t even like kids .
come on .
pediatric surgery
has nothing to do with liking kids .
all right , lily . i need you to stay still , okay ?
or you &apos;re gonna mess up the test .
i &apos;m gonna be right over there in that booth ,
and that &apos;s how it goes .
lily , you can &apos;t have this in the machine , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , look , guys ,
why don &apos;t you back off for a little while , okay ?
hey . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i mean , you go into peds because it &apos;s elite ,
you know , uh , hard @-@ core , the best of the best .
na na na , fire and rain
instead of driving me insane
but i can &apos;t stay mad at you for anything ...
did you know that there are
only 38 pediatric surgery fellowship spots in the country ?
the country .
i mean , uh , to compare , cardiothoracic has 120 .
pediatric surgery is the elite of the elite .
so yeah , i &apos;d consider specializing ...
in pediatric surgery , for sure .
but not because of the kids .
definitely not because of the kids .
... and i wouldn &apos;t change a thing ...
airway &apos;s clear .
you know , the truth is that
it &apos;s actually a good thing that ...
the shooting happened here instead of somewhere else ,
because we are better equipped to handle trauma .
i mean , we see trauma every day . it &apos;s our job .
we got a stab wound there .
yeah , i @-@ i got it .
put him on a monitor .
thank you .
uh , he needs surgery .
okay , let &apos;s pack it ,
stabilize him , and get him upstairs .
right away , doctor .
right . right .
there &apos;s another incoming trauma on his way in ,
so i &apos;m just gonna stay down here and handle that .
yeah , i mean , trauma is a part of our job ,
so improvising and thinking on our feet ,
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trained to do .
no , it &apos;s not strange dr. yang isn &apos;t coming with me .
i was available , so i &apos;ll take this guy ,
she &apos;ll take the next one . it &apos;s first come , first serve .
everyone wants to get in that o.r.
we &apos;re surgeons . we live to cut .
it &apos;s who we are .
it &apos;s not too late , you know ?
we could move up our next trip ,
skip out of here , and -- and just catch a plane tonight .
i mean , you &apos;ve been fine this long without the surgery .
you &apos;d be fine a little longer .
colostomy reversal is a very basic surgery .
on a typical day , i might do two or three in a row .
uh , this was the surgery
i was supposed to perform on mary that day .
the day that ...
that -- that , um ...
anyway , um ,
medically speaking ,
she was getting a little stoma prolapse
and some electrolyte imbalances ,
so it &apos;s good that we &apos;re doing the surgery now .
good to get it over with .
so we just got lily &apos;s labs back ,
and i &apos;m taking &apos; em to dr. robbins .
they don &apos;t , uh ...
i mean , i &apos;m just saying ,
i think that at least you could be happy .
well , i thought we were hap --
uh , should i come back ?
no , whatever . we &apos;re done anyway .
uh , you have -- you have lily &apos;s results ?
well , it &apos;s her decision , obviously .
it &apos;s an incredible opportunity .
i mean , you don &apos;t just , uh ,
turn down a carter madison grant .
nobody turns down a carter madison grant .
i mean , i @-@ i ... i know that . i ...
i understand that . i do .
i mean , if the situation were reversed ...
actually , no . you know what no .
if the situation were reversed , i would turn the thing down .
i wouldn &apos;t even consider
moving to another continent right now .
but i &apos;m not her .
so , uh ...
like i said , it &apos;s an incredible opportunity .
hope you &apos;ve got that bone saw ready ,
&apos;cause i am really in the mood to cut off some arms .
unfortunately , because of her prior surgeries ,
lily has fistulas
that make removing her tumor that much more difficult .
the tumor is now so large
that it &apos;s impinging on her airway and esophagus .
莉莉的母亲
removing the tumor would mean
removing lily &apos;s entire trachea ,
which means ...
lily wouldn &apos;t be able to breathe at all .
the other thing that &apos;s changed for me
most since the shooting is that ...
now i feel like ...
there &apos;s always something that we can do ,
&apos;cause i should &apos;ve died .
you know , i was shot point @-@ blank .
so , uh ...
there &apos;s always something that we can do .
so you &apos;re saying ...
that if you operate ...
it &apos;s a death sentence ,
and if you don &apos;t operate , it &apos;s a death sentence ?
so in a few minutes ,
we &apos;ll be ready to completely
detach the arms from the donor .
why use zigzag incisions ?
to get maximum exposure .
good . see what i &apos;m doing here ?
i &apos;m tagging each vessel , artery and vein
so we know exactly how
to hook them up to the recipient .
it &apos;s kind of like the back of your tv .
you need to know which connection goes where ,
or you wind up with sound and no picture
or a picture and no sound .
the minute we remove the arms from the donor ,
the tissue starts to die ,
so we have to work fast , really fast .
we have a very limited window
to complete this part of the surgery .
okay .
okay , let &apos;s get started .
you don &apos;t understand .
i was sent to get coffee for dr. sloan
because he needs his caffeine right now
to get through the most amazing surgery
that is happening right now in o.r. 2 .
so i @-@ i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s not okay
to be late for the making of medical history ,
so you need to let me through , okay ,
to get to that surgery , to get dr. sloan his caffeine ,
to witness medical history being made .
i @-@ i -- my i.d. is valid , i promise .
let me take a look .
yeah , she -- she swiped it a couple times .
it didn &apos;t go through .
just go . just go .
enter security access code .
hey . hey . anybody ?
enter security access code .
nurse ! come here .
dr. avery . dr. avery , your patient !
enter security access code .
enter security access code .
avery ! dr. avery !
hold on ! dr. avery !
enter security ...
so we &apos;re about nine hours in .
uh , dr. torres has finished attaching the donor arm bones
to the recipient with titanium plates and screws ,
and now they are beginning to attach the tendons .
i &apos;m on it .
where have you been ?
has getting shot changed me ?
um , i don &apos;t think
i love my job any more or any less .
um , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m a @-@ a better doctor or worse .
uh , if anything it &apos;s made me grateful ,
um , to be here .
so yeah , getting shot has changed me
in the sense that i feel lucky .
we &apos;ve reconnected the arteries and veins .
but we need to check the circulation before we continue .
what we &apos;re gonna do now
is release the tourniquets one arm at a time
and then look to see if blood flows into the vessels .
okay , moment of truth .
releasing the tourniquet .
arm &apos;s pinking up !
that &apos;s good . good job , everybody .
the commute &apos;s tough .
we &apos;ve been coming here
since lily &apos;s tumor got diagnosed three years ago .
it &apos;s just the two of us , just lily and i.
we live over three hours away ,
so it makes it difficult for me
to come more than twice a week and weekends .
i hate leaving her for that long .
but i just want what &apos;s best for her .
i want her to live .
dr. robbins came to me , and she said
there might be something they could do for lily after all --
something experimental .
um , that &apos;s why you come to a place like this , you know ?
because even if it is a commute , three hours on the road ,
it &apos;s nothing if -- if it &apos;ll save lily &apos;s life .
we &apos;ve completed a stent to temporarily help lily breathe ,
and now we &apos;re gonna remove part of her twelfth rib .
see ? it &apos;s just one more example of how our doctors here rise .
first a carter madison grant winner ,
and now cutting @-@ edge ...
regenerative medicine .
well , there &apos;s no artificial replacement for a trachea .
we know that . but then i remembered a study ,
and i thought , well ... what if it isn &apos;t artificial ?
we &apos;re gonna use some of lily &apos;s own cells
to manufacture her a new trachea .
grow it in the lab , remove the damaged organ ,
replace it with a newer model .
outstanding .
absolutely outstanding , dr. robbins .
let me in here . move . avery , avery !
avery , look , i was waiting in radiation .
how &apos;s the patient ?
damn it ! how long has he been coding ? !
avery , you &apos;re gonna break his ribs .
okay , okay , okay .
o - okay , okay , okay .
the new security system ? yeah , i &apos;m not a fan .
compressions only last for so long ,
so you call whoever you need to call ,
you override whatever you need to override ,
and you open the door before i report you
for the wrongful death of a patient !
avery .
avery , it &apos;s okay . just hang in there , okay ?
avery .
all right , you can stop now .
someone else can take over .
avery , look at me . look at me . you can stop now .
avery , avery , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s been , uh ...
hard ...
since the shooting .
i , uh , i lost some fr -- some friends that day .
you learn to think about things differently .
like , um , like buttoning a button --
you can &apos;t -- you can &apos;t do that ,
you know , even with the hooks , so ...
now i just buy zack t @-@ shirts and hoodies .
he can usually get those on by himself
by using his hooks and his feet .
and , uh , i help him bathe in the morning ,
and ... well , brush his teeth and shave .
it took me --
it took me a long time to get the hang of that .
but it &apos;s all in the wrist , i &apos;ve learned .
it &apos;s late .
i thought i w -- i would have an update by now .
so what &apos;s the big deal ? you &apos;ll visit her .
she &apos;ll visit you . it &apos;s just a plane ride .
um , can we not talk about this right now ?
arms getting cyanotic .
the vessel attachments are all good .
uh , picture . we &apos;ve got picture and no sound .
excuse me ?
move over . just move over .
any update ?
what ? just tell me .
um ...
there was a possible complication with one of the arms .
complication ?
there &apos;s a clot ,
and they &apos;re trying to , uh , restore blood flow .
but ...
he could lose it , couldn &apos;t he ?
well ...
one arm &apos;s better than none , right ?
torres , do you need help ?
i can retract that for you .
want me to patch that ?
just give me a second .
are you sure you don &apos;t want me to ...
i know what i &apos;m doing ...
torres , do you want me to patch this ?
just give me a second .
okay , i know what i &apos;m doing . i just need a second .
everybody , shut up .
okay . all right .
there . picture and sound , i think .
yeah .
good job .
good . nicely done .
basically , we break the cartilage down
to its cellular level and turn it into a protein liquid .
we build a scaffolding to hold the liquid ,
then we cook it in an incubator to let it grow .
this is the incubator .
we &apos;re gonna grow the trachea in here first .
and then once it &apos;s big enough , we &apos;re gonna insert it
into lily &apos;s abdomen till it gets stronger .
it &apos;ll be there a few months .
then we &apos;ll take that new trachea
and replace her old one .
some might say that a shooting would set people back .
then you look at residents like dr. karev
and attendings like dr. robbins ,
and you see their -- their innovative thinking ,
their resilience .
you see them becoming reinvested in -- in medicine .
it &apos;s inspiring , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;ve mobilized the two intestinal segments ,
and i &apos;ve stapled ,
and ...
that &apos;s it .
textbook . in an out in an hour .
time to close .
it went well .
uh , mary &apos;s being wheeled into recovery right now .
so it &apos;s ... it &apos;s over ?
it &apos;s over .
oh , god .
oh , thank you .
oh . oh . thank you .
thank you .
this is , uh ,
one surgery i am happy ... to have finished .
tonight ...
you know , i may very well take the night off .
go out . maybe have a drink .
who knows ?
oh , man .
oh , gentlemen and lady ... hey .
we gave a man arms today .
we did .
i like to think of it more as i gave a man arms today .
the rest of you just helped .
another round for everybody but my friend here .
come on .
that &apos;s a really nice shirt , by the way .
where &apos;d you get that , the special titan store ?
hey , you saw the way she saved that arm today ?
you want to hear something funny ?
she hooked up my tv .
i &apos;m still only getting sound out of one speaker .
so i &apos;ll have to irrigate the trachea
with this protein mixture a few times a day ,
every day , for the next few weeks ...
which means i &apos;ll pretty much be living in this hospital
to make sure it gets done right .
that &apos;s my priority , is to make sure this trachea grows .
i mean , it &apos;s my focus .
i &apos;ll basically be eating , breathing and sleeping trachea
for the next month .
do people treat me differently now , after the shooting ?
uh , well , um ... i mean , yeah .
i mean , like , you &apos;re here filming me , so ...
i mean , like , people like to say what i did was heroic ,
but it wasn &apos;t . you know , it was just a thing i had to do .
i think people like to have a hero ,
and , uh , it-- it-- it ...
it makes them feel better to think that ,
there in the middle of all that horror ,
you-- you know , that there &apos;s someone ...
special working medical miracles . but ...
i mean , i ...
i- i mean , i don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t have super surgical powers .
you know , i mean , i &apos;m-- i- i did what--
cristina is a hero ...
especially to me .
the truth is , is most surgeons
could not have done what she did that day .
if you had seen--
stop .
if you had seen--
stop . please just-- can you ...
can you just stop this ?
can we cut ?
just doing a little construction .
things are always evolving around here ...
for the better .
always for the better .
hey , let me give you a hand .
uh , yeah , i mean , he already has some feeling
at the tops of his new arms , like--
watch this .
not bad , huh ?
look right there .
you can barely even see a scar
where they put the tube in last month .
and now i &apos;m back today to get my new trachea sewn into my belly .
dr. karev calls me the human incubator .
he &apos;s been sending me photos from the lab , of my new trachea .
see ? look at that right there .
it &apos;s really grown .
see ? right there .
i always figured i &apos;d grow up to be a rock star ,
but i might consider being a doctor now , too .
i mean , dr. karev is pretty cool .
check it out . homegrown trachea .
whatever you do ,
just don &apos;t screw around and mess up my trachea , okay ?
i mean it .
i know you think you &apos;re a rock star ,
but no mosh pits or crowd surfing .
i mean , lilith fair &apos;s okay ,
but no drinking , or drugs , or smoking , or driving drunk ,
or giving your number out to guys you don &apos;t know .
you get that i &apos;m 9 ?
well , i @-@ i really can &apos;t believe it .
the big move to africa is really just around the corner .
yes , i would say things are better between us now ,
and , uh , yes , we worked it out
even with arizona moving to africa .
the fix was , uh , pretty simple , actually . i &apos;m going with her .
got you some new flowers .
uh ... yellow ones today .
uh , don &apos;t ask me what kind . i have no idea .
they &apos;re , uh , they &apos;re pretty , though ,
just like you .
it &apos;s rare ,
but sometimes patients do not wake up from surgery .
with every surgery , there is a risk .
in this case , the post @-@ operative c.t. showed no sign of stroke ,
no acute bleed .
we &apos;ve run p.e.t. scans , m.r.i.s ,
tried fluids , pressors .
basically , that &apos;s what i have to go and talk to bill about today .
mary has been in a coma since her surgery .
there &apos;s no sign of brain activity .
and now she &apos;s septic .
her organs are failing .
best @-@ case scenario ,
um , she regains some function
and wakes up with extreme deficits , mentally and physically .
but the chance of her ...
waking up at this point ...
it &apos;s hard ...
to imagine someone surviving a crazy gunman ,
and then not to survive such a simple surgery .
i have to go and tell bill that it &apos;s time .
he has a decision to make .
well , we went through the scariest thing a person can go through ,
and we survived .
so now every day is just a gift .
and we &apos;re all just blessed ...
blessed to be here ,
blessed to be doing what we do best ,
not bad , huh ?
which is saving lives ...
every day ...
one life at a time ,
we &apos;re healed ...
so we can continue healing others .
is there any one thing you &apos;ll take away from all of this ?
