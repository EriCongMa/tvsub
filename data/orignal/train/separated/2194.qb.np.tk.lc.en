what was in the safe ?
about three million dollars worth of loose diamonds .
our thief &apos;s real name is radomir ivanovich .
he &apos;s former serbian special forces .
he repurposed his skills
to become a high @-@ end jewel thief .
we know about the deal you had in place
to fence those diamonds .
guys like ivanovich ,
they don &apos;t die easily .
you &apos;re arresting me ?
marco reyes took danny williams &apos;s brother .
i borrowed that money to help pay for that ransom .
no matter how it was used , that &apos;s still a crime .
your friend killed a man , and you aided and abetted .
this is gonna cost you
in ways that you could not possibly predict .
i gave chin that money to move me out of general pop .
and you &apos;ll testify to that ?
absolutely .
how does minimum security sound ?
i want that in writing .
he killed coughlin and then he escaped .
without coughlin or gabriel &apos;s testimony ,
there &apos;s no case against you .
you &apos;re welcome .
you &apos;re telling me that clay , your best friend ,
guy you &apos;ve known for 25 years ,
pushed his wife off this cliff ?
yeah , that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
leann stockwell ...
one you &apos;ve been having an affair with for over a year .
she told me you wanted to leave your wife
and be with her .
you can &apos;t prove it .
i &apos;m gonna spend the night on a plane back to chicago ,
and i &apos;m gonna talk to leann in person .
then i &apos;m gonna search your house .
i &apos;m gonna talk to everybody you know .
i &apos;m gonna use all of that to lock your ass up .
listen to that crowd . he &apos;s crushing it .
i certainly agree .
it takes serious sartorius muscles
to pull off pelvic gyrations like that .
wow , this guy &apos;s got it all .
vocals , stage presence ...
and the most important quality
when it comes to impersonating elvis : swagger .
三号选手 莱恩 · 柯林斯
the judges seem to agree with you .
you know , elvis actually opened
his &apos; 73 &quot; aloha from hawaii &quot; concert with &quot; see , see rider , &quot;
but i get why collins went with &quot; burning love &quot; --
it shows off his vocal range .
that went south fast .
he doesn &apos;t look well .
max , what &apos;s going on ?
something &apos;s wrong .
excuse me . excuse me .
how was chicago ?
frigid .
and not just the weather .
clay &apos;s girlfriend wouldn &apos;t talk , huh ?
nope .
and neither would all my friends at the chicago pd .
as far they &apos;re all concerned ,
diane &apos;s death was an accident
and i &apos;m just a guy who &apos;s accusing an innocent widower
of killing his wife .
i &apos;m sorry , lou .
yeah , so am i.
these are guys i worked with side by side for years , man ,
and now they &apos;re all treating me like i &apos;m ...
internal affairs .
old code of silence .
only this time , it &apos;s me on the outside looking in .
clay must have circled the wagons
when he was released from custody ,
convinced his people back home not to talk .
yeah .
he might have them fooled , but sooner or later ...
i &apos;m gonna lock him up for what he did .
anything you need from me , you let me know .
thank you , man , i will .
well , look ... on a positive note ,
the trip was not a total bust .
i did manage to score myself
six deep @-@ dish pies from malnati &apos;s .
renee and the kids are about to welcome me home a hero .
i &apos;m sorry , did you say that you just flew ten hours straight
with a bunch of pizzas in your suitcase ?
is that what you said ?
you &apos;re damn right .
and today is your lucky day , because as a result
of this unexpected ,
pleasant little pick @-@ me @-@ up at the airport ,
i &apos;m gonna cut you in on a slice .
yeah , i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m kind of
a thin @-@ crust guy myself , but thank you all the same .
hey , max . what &apos;s up ?
the king is dead ... again .
come on , man , somebody had to say it .
all right , max , tell us exactly what happened .
well , a few months ago , jerry invited me
to attend the convention with him .
he already had his elvis costume , so i decided
to go as presley &apos;s longtime manager , colonel tom parker .
can you skip ahead
to the part where this guy died ?
of course .
well , mr. collins was in the middle
of a rousing rendition of &quot; burning love &quot;
when he suddenly got disoriented and collapsed .
i was brought back here
and found him unresponsive , and , despite my best efforts ,
i was unable to resuscitate him .
all right , well , we got pills , we got liquor .
we &apos;ll see what toxicology says , but i &apos;m thinking this guy
partied too hard and paid the price for it .
looks like classic rock and roll death to me .
except the pills are a commonly prescribed allergy medication ,
and he didn &apos;t ingest enough alcohol
to warrant such an adverse reaction .
if there &apos;s a point , please get to it--
i got a bunch of pizzas in my suitcase ,
and they need to be eaten .
the point is : this was not an accident .
upper airway irritation ,
flushed skin , purplish @-@ tinged blood , and a faint
almond aroma around the victim &apos;s mouth .
all signs lead to one possible c.o.d. :
cyanide toxicity .
so he was poisoned ?
correct .
and since cyanide takes effect
within 20 minutes of consumption ,
mr. collins ingested the poison
right before he got on stage .
behold ...
the smoking gun .
commander , would you kindly inspect the cork ?
what is that , a needle mark ?
that is correct .
somebody injected the bottle with cyanide ,
then cleverly reapplied the wax @-@ tipped top to disguise
any signs of tampering .
mr. collins was murdered in front of 10,000 people .
well , obviously , one of them wasn &apos;t a fan .
hey , this is lieutenant kelly .
we &apos;re gonna need hpd support
at our crime scene for crowd control .
okay . thanks .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s a fugitive and a cop killer .
if he was smart , he would be long gone by now .
well , getting off the island takes resources and connections--
two things that gabriel &apos;s in short supply of right now .
or maybe you &apos;re the reason why he &apos;s sticking around .
you don &apos;t have to worry about me , kono .
yeah , i do , because gabriel blames you
for what happened to malia .
and we both know what he &apos;s capable of .
now he &apos;s tipped his hand .
next time he shows , i &apos;ll be ready for him .
it wasn &apos;t just the &quot; aloha &quot; concert .
elvis flat @-@ out loved hawaii--
he shot three movies here ,
he had an estate up in pupukea ,
and he even performed for the troops
at the uss arizona benefit in &apos; 61 .
that &apos;s fascinating .
welcome to the , uh , freak show .
we got 17 elvises , all of them
potential suspects or witnesses .
actually , the correct terminology is &quot; elvii . &quot;
but you can also call them etas .
elvis tribute artists .
i recall you doing a little tribute
of your own back in the tenth grade .
if i remember correctly , your rendition of
&quot; love me &quot; brought the house down .
look , suit still fits .
oh , no , this is , like , my sixth one .
but i &apos;m just here as a spectator today .
sweet shag .
five @-@ inch pile .
although the color &apos;s a little off .
the real jungle room at graceland &apos;s more of a hunter green .
what &apos;s a jungle room , exactly ?
elvis designed it to be his man cave .
later , it was turned into a studio
where he recorded parts of his last two albums .
you can actually hear the waterfall on a few of the tracks .
that &apos;s amazing-- the amount of useless trivia that you &apos;ve
managed to obtain over the years just really blows my mind .
hey , when it comes to the king , nothing &apos;s trivial .
all right , guys ,
here &apos;s what we know .
uh , victim &apos;s name was lane collins .
he died from cyanide poisoning-- delivery system was
a bottle of bourbon found in his dressing room .
the organizers say the access to the backstage
is pretty limited-- the only people allowed back there
are the crew and the performers .
okay , so what are we thinking ?
one of these guys slips him the bottle ,
figures he &apos;d thin out the competition ?
makes sense .
collins was a big up @-@ and @-@ comer on the scene .
he &apos;s also a local boy ,
which made him the favorite to take down the title tonight .
any prize money come with that ?
$ 20k in cash .
but i got to tell you guys ,
my conspiracy radar &apos;s picking up some bad juju on this one .
seriously . up until the point when he collapsed and died ,
collins &apos; performance was spot @-@ on .
at least that &apos;s what i thought .
later , when i went to the video ,
i realized he made one ginormous mistake .
check out the jumpsuit . it &apos;s a classic sunset design ,
only the color scheme is more from
elvis &apos;s american eagle suit .
blue and red instead of yellow and copper .
so what ?
so that &apos;s like superman flying around in a purple cape .
it &apos;s unnatural .
it &apos;s unholy , even .
elvis never wore anything like this .
all right , i get it .
so our victim was not elvis .
no , but he was a professional eta .
and considering the points awarded for wardrobe ,
it seems a little odd that he &apos;d make such an unforced error .
yeah , totally . um , you know ,
to have a conspiracy theory , you actually need a theory though .
i admit , it &apos;s a work in progress .
okay , uh , jerry , thank you .
we will , uh , explore
the costume angle a little later on , but i think right now
we should focus on our suspect pool .
we find out who gave the vic that bottle ,
we find our killer--
so let &apos;s all split up and find an elvis .
yeah , should be interesting .
poison ?
that ain &apos;t my style .
i want to kill someone , i use my bare hands !
you know elvis was a black belt in karate , right ?
yeah , i think ... i think i heard that .
why would i want lane dead ?
it &apos;s not like i got a shot at winning this thing-- look at me .
young man &apos;s game , huh ?
i &apos;m a 71 @-@ year @-@ old elvis
with a double knee replacement .
but i still got my share of sideburn chasers .
sideburn chasers ?
yeah , chicks , man . my groupies .
my knees don &apos;t work too well ,
but the rest of me still does .
to be honest , the whole competitive thing
doesn &apos;t really interest me .
i &apos;m all about challenging perceptions .
like , why does elvis ...
even have to be a man ?
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s a ... that &apos;s a very good point ,
but you &apos;re not answering my question .
were you or were you not in lane collins &apos; dressing room
prior to his performance ?
no . i wasn &apos;t in his dressing room .
but i can find out who was .
oh , yeah ?
just give me one of the badges , and i can crack the case .
nixon deputized elvis , you know .
made him a federal narcotics ... agent .
you don &apos;t say .
sure , i was in lane &apos;s dressing room-- i stopped by to wish him
good luck and offer him a peanut butter and banana sandwich .
i always pack a few extra ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m hypoglycemic .
did you offer him a drink with that , maybe some bourbon ?
no . that &apos;s funny .
lane had actually gotten one as a gift .
he was cracking it open when i came in .
he did offer me a shot , but i said no-- 16 months sober .
you have no idea how lucky you are ; that bottle was poisoned .
if that had been vodka , i &apos;d be dead right now .
lane never really talked about his personal life .
in this business ,
you kind of learn to check your identity at the front door .
but the rumors started to flow ,
and eventually , we all learned about his background .
what background is that ?
* she &apos;s everything that you wanted *
* you can &apos;t pretend anymore &apos; cause you found it *
so , lane collins was the lead singer
in a band called freelance riot .
this song was all over the radio
for a few months back in 2006 .
these guys were hyped as the biggest musical act
to come out of hawaii since jack johnson .
i guess it didn &apos;t work out . i never heard of them .
well , they released a couple of albums that went nowhere .
finally called it quits a few months ago .
only thing , they &apos;re breakup wasn &apos;t quite mutual .
when the news broke , the guitar player ,
kaleo fisher , firebombed the internet .
check out some of these messages .
at lane collins .
&quot; still dislodging the knife from my back .
thanks for throwing it all away , dude . &quot;
hashtag &quot; choke on puke and die . &quot;
yeah , and according to chubby elvis ,
lane told him that the bottle was a gift from an old friend .
where do we find this guy ?
* waited so long *
* waited so long *
* i &apos;ve got two tickets to paradise *
* won &apos;t you pack your bags , we &apos;ll leave tonight *
* i &apos;ve got two tickets to paradise *
far cry from selling out the blaisdell .
playing this crowd every night would make a guy homicidal .
danny , what &apos;s up ?
it , uh , pains me to say it , but jerry might have been
onto something with his whole jumpsuit theory .
how &apos;s that ?
we dumped our victim &apos;s phone .
turns out he made six phone calls
to a local costume shop . what &apos;s up , guys ?
uh , anyway , he obviously knew there was something wrong ,
and he was trying to figure out why he got
the wrong jumpsuit , i &apos;m guessing .
well , you see , buddy ?
there is a method to jerry &apos;s madness .
well , whoever &apos;s at that shop might have been the last person
our victim spoke to , so i &apos;m gonna head over there now .
all right , keep me posted .
* i &apos;ve got two tickets to paradise *
* i &apos;ve got two tickets to paradise *
mahalo .
kaleo fisher .
why don &apos;t you take five .
so crazy .
i can &apos;t believe lane &apos;s gone .
really ?
cause i believe your exact words to him were :
&quot; choke on puke and die . &quot;
come on , i was just venting .
turns out , social media isn &apos;t the best place
to express yourself when you &apos;re drunk and bitter .
yeah . so now you &apos;re gonna tell us
how much you loved the guy , right ?
no . i hated him .
i poured my life into that band ,
and he took it all away .
i mean , look around .
i &apos;m singing cover songs to tourists .
this gig sucks .
but as much as i blame lane ,
he was also my only ticket out of here .
i &apos;d been talking to some booking agents about getting
freelance back on the road , but ...
everyone knows-- without a front man ,
there &apos;s no band .
so was lane on board
for this big reunion tour ?
i went to see him a couple days ago
to sell him on the idea , and ...
he told me he loved me like a brother ,
that he &apos;d always be proud of what we accomplished ,
but as far as he was concerned , those days were behind him .
so he shoots you down ,
and then a scant 48 hours later ,
he just drinks some poison and drops dead .
you know what &apos;s funny , the bottle of hartigan that killed him ,
according to witnesses ,
lane said it was given to him by an old friend .
wait .
hartigan ? that &apos;s what he was drinking ?
that &apos;s right .
i didn &apos;t give him that bottle ...
but i know who did .
can you at least tell me what i &apos;m doing here ?
it &apos;s coming up . listen .
* i turn around and you &apos;re gone *
* playing love songs for strangers *
* and breaking hearts again *
right there , that last line .
you hear that ? it &apos;s kind of hard to
make out what he &apos;s saying though .
well , it &apos;d be helpful
if we could talk to the original lead singer , but ,
well ... he &apos;s dead .
right .
but miss miller here , she &apos;s a huge fan .
i mean , you must &apos;ve heard this song a thousand times .
can you help us out ?
the lyric is :
* playing love songs for strangers *
* and drinking hartigan *
it sounds like that , doesn &apos;t it ?
but it &apos;s not it . according to the guy who cowrote the song ,
it &apos;s actually : &quot; breaking hearts again . &quot;
breaking hearts again ?
uh ... no .
you &apos;re wrong .
* i turn around and you &apos;re gone *
* playing love songs for strangers *
* and breaking hearts again *
yeah , see , uh ...
kaleo said the band used to have a good laugh
when you &apos;d show up to gigs with a bottle of hartigan .
lane didn &apos;t have the heart to tell you
that you got the words wrong .
and nobody &apos;s ever heard of a rock star
turning down a free bottle of hooch .
i &apos;m pretty sure that lane knew you were obsessed with him .
it &apos;s just too bad that he didn &apos;t know
how certifiably crazy you are .
hpd found wax on your stovetop
in your apartment .
same type of wax that &apos;s used to seal
the tops of old hartigan bourbon bottles .
and you forgot to clear your history on your web browser .
&quot; how to kill someone with poison . &quot;
&quot; where to buy cyanide . &quot;
he &apos;s the one that should be embarrassed .
i mean , come on .
dressing up like that ,
shaking his hips .
that &apos;s why you killed him ?
&apos;cause he disappointed you ?
nope .
no , i killed him to protect him from himself .
to protect his legacy .
because now people will remember him
for what he really was .
what is that ?
a legend , like morrison , like cobain ...
okay , let &apos;s not get carried away , all right ?
whew , you &apos;re crazy .
he &apos;s a legend .
so , i mean , how &apos;s the irony completely lost on this woman ?
the inspiration for killing her idol
is the song she got the words wrong to .
well , what &apos;d you expect ? the girl &apos;s 118 pounds of crazy .
but now that she &apos;s confessed ,
i can finally get those pizzas home--
time to get my deep dish on , baby .
yeah , danny , what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m over at the costume shop .
oh , no , you can stand down .
we just got a confession . case is closed .
no , no , we , uh , we caught another case .
uh , shop owner &apos;s been shot dead .
uh , place has been tossed .
somebody &apos;s looking for something ,
and i &apos;m not sure that they found what they were looking for .
wait a minute . what ?
it &apos;s got to be about lane &apos;s costume .
this is dr. max bergman ,
performing the autopsy on lane collins .
the victim &apos;s 39 and appears to be dressed in ...
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
down on the ground !
do it now !
he so much as blinks , shoot him .
there were three of them , all of them in masks .
i keep thinking maybe there was something i could have done .
all right , max , you can &apos;t blame yourself for this .
it &apos;s unsettling when a cadaver goes missing .
i don &apos;t think the body &apos;s what they were interested in .
mcgarrett .
yeah . we &apos;ll be right there .
three blocks from the m.e. &apos; s office .
didn &apos;t take them long to strip that jumpsuit .
yeah , listen , uh ... explain this to me , would you ?
you &apos;re a smart a guy .
i get the costume switcheroo and all that--
i &apos;ve had the same thing happen to me at the dry cleaners--
but normally , when i get somebody else &apos;s pants ,
they don &apos;t go on a violent killing spree
to get them back .
check this out .
why , they must have ...
fallen off the jumpsuit .
except this one ... is a real diamond .
now , how could you possibly know that ?
because generally ,
fake diamonds don &apos;t have serial numbers .
you guys are gonna love this .
remember this mug ?
radomir ivanovich .
knocked over a jewelry store for a bunch of diamonds .
exactly . and according to the serial number
you found on that diamond ,
it was from that heist .
it turns out that before he was killed ,
he actually stashed that loot somewhere ,
and hpd &apos;s been trying to recover it ever since .
and damn if it didn &apos;t just turn up
in the most unexpected place .
we got us some pretty creative diamond smugglers .
all right , the convention ends tomorrow , right ?
which means all these elvises ...
elvii .
excuse me ?
the plural of elvis is &quot; elvii . &quot;
jerry told me that-- you weren &apos;t there-- and , uh ,
he &apos;s an authority on the subject ,
so i just wanted you to know .
okay , as i was saying ,
this convention &apos;s gonna end tomorrow ,
and all these elvii are gonna be flying out together , right ?
right . so the smugglers hide these diamonds
in an elvis costume ,
and all tsa sees is a glitzy jumpsuit going by .
but this isn &apos;t your average bedazzle job , right ?
so you got to get a professional costumer .
but the professional costumer screws up
and accidentally gives the costume to lane collins .
on the exact day
that a deranged fan decides to kill him .
guy &apos;s got good luck .
all right , so this convention ends tomorrow .
they &apos;ll be wrapping it up tonight ,
which means we got less than six hours .
chin , kono , see if they ever had any leads to
the diamonds &apos; whereabouts .
if we could find where ivanovich stashed those diamonds ,
maybe it &apos;ll help us lead to the smugglers .
copy .
you know , i would think
this guy &apos;s already got a buyer lined up .
i &apos;m gonna check with interpol ,
see if we can find who might be on the receiving end .
all right , good . you and me ,
we got someone to see .
who &apos;s that ?
who &apos;s the one person connected to that heist who &apos;s still alive ?
barry burns !
hey , fellas !
long time no see .
i see , uh , house arrest is treating you well , huh ?
it &apos;s the best ever .
i get to exercise every day ,
and i &apos;m catching up on my reading ,
and taking a class online in acrylic painting .
your wife must be glad you &apos;re home .
mm ... actually , she left me .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
oh , don &apos;t be .
that &apos;s the best part about it .
now i &apos;m ordering in .
more than just food , if you catch my drift .
yeah , i got it .
can i interest you guys in a smoothie ?
i just started a new cleanse .
i &apos;m good .
uh , no , thanks .
i don &apos;t drink anything i have to chew .
barry , uh ...
it &apos;s been great catching up , it really has .
you look terrific . uh , but we &apos;re actually here on some business .
okay . what can i do for you ?
well , we were hoping you could tell us where radomir ivanovich
may have stashed the diamonds he stole .
well ... you &apos;re not the first guys
to come around asking that question .
is that right ?
when the word spread the diamonds were out there ,
every scumbag crook on the island wanted to get them .
it became , like , a bad @-@ guy treasure hunt .
and i &apos;m always the first stop .
aha . you see , that &apos;s probably because you are ivanovich &apos;s fence .
yes . but i &apos;m also a scumbag crook .
you think he &apos;s gonna trust me with something like that ?
that &apos;s a good point .
barry , we &apos;re gonna need a list
of all the people who came knocking , okay ?
okay , i guess i owe you guys one .
you know , if it wasn &apos;t for that deal you gave me ,
i &apos;d probably be someone &apos;s prison bitch right now .
with a body like that , definitely .
thank you .
i guess .
so check this out-- a couple months before he dies ,
ivanovich charges $ 2,500 at a local wine shop .
so the guy likes his wine .
actually , that &apos;s the exact amount
the shop charges to rent a private locker in their wine cellar .
ivanovich prepaid for an entire year .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a police report .
last week , three guys hit the shop in the middle of the night .
they busted open a bunch of lockers ,
except they didn &apos;t take a single bottle .
&apos;cause they weren &apos;t looking for wine ,
they were after ivanovich &apos;s diamonds .
so the height and build markers
confirm that it was the same crew that hit the m.e. &apos; s office .
and thanks to those masks ,
we &apos;re no closer to identifying them .
it seems like they &apos;re not the only ones who knew
where the diamonds were stashed though .
the shop owner said that there was somebody else
poking around the locker this morning ,
so we pulled the video .
wait a minute , this guy &apos;s got keys .
how does he have keys to ivanovich &apos;s locker ?
here &apos;s how .
facial rec i.d. &apos; d him as adrian ivanovich ,
radomir ivanovich &apos;s brother .
according to dhs ,
he entered hawaii less than 24 hours ago
using an alias .
and according to his file ,
he makes his brother look like a boy scout in comparison .
extortion , kidnapping ,
murder for hire-- adrian &apos;s done it all .
guess he wasn &apos;t too happy
that someone beat him to the diamonds .
the guy was accused of war crimes in bosnia .
who knows what makes him happy ?
all right , so this guy &apos;s pissed , looking for answers .
what &apos;s his next move ?
if he knew where the diamonds were stashed ,
he knew who his brother was in business with .
oh , not barry burns .
barry .
don &apos;t answer that .
who the hell are you ?
you took something from my brother .
i &apos;m here to get it back .
this is barry b.
thanks for hollering at me .
leave a message , and i &apos;ll holla back .
i &apos;d like to kill this guy
even his voice mail &apos;s annoying .
yeah , keep trying .
lou , what do you got ?
so i been going through this list
that burns was kind enough to provide for us .
any of them look good for this ?
not even close .
look , the guys who hit that wine shop were pros .
i &apos;m talking about a sophisticated three @-@ man team
that was able to bypass a commercial @-@ grade alarm system .
now , there &apos;s nobody on burns &apos;s list that &apos;s capable of that .
the only guys on there are small @-@ timers and stick @-@ up guys .
very surprised-- the schmuck lied to us .
you got that right .
burns knew where those diamonds were all along .
this whole thing with the list is nothing but a stall .
yeah , well , the clock &apos;s about to run out on burns .
barry ? barry ?
barry ?
steve .
got signs of a struggle .
chin ...
i need an exact location on burns .
all right , well , according to the tracking monitor ,
he &apos;s still at the house . stand by .
signal shows he &apos;s at the back of the property .
help !
help !
help !
danny .
help !
over here .
help !
oh , thank god .
thought i was gonna die in there .
like , a couple more hours , you probably would have .
this thing saved my life .
oh , yeah ? how &apos;s that ?
&apos;cause that @-@ that maniac was gonna shoot me in the head ,
and i said , &quot; hey ...
the cops are gonna be alerted right away
if this monitor stops registering a pulse . &quot;
you know , it doesn &apos;t actually work like that ,
you know that , right ?
it doesn &apos;t ?
good thing i didn &apos;t know that .
okay , enough , all right ? you lied to us , okay ?
you told us a bunch of phony names ,
so we &apos;d be spinning our wheels .
why would i do that ?
why would you do that ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re a jerk is why .
the other thing is , you need to buy some time
so your guys can smuggle the diamonds off the island .
i got good news-- the good news is
you finally now do get to be someone &apos;s prison bitch .
no . no , no .
please . they &apos;ll rip me apart in there .
okay , well , you need to reevaluate
your current situation and talk right now .
okay , okay .
i knew where the diamonds were stashed .
so ... i put together a crew to boost them ...
and smuggle them off the island .
where do we find this crew ?
they &apos;re holed up at the walani hotel .
we got one of those elvis impersonators to be our mule .
and he was supposed to fly out with the diamonds
first thing tomorrow morning .
what do you mean , supposed to ?
well , i told ivanovich &apos;s psychopath of a brother everything .
if those guys aren &apos;t dead already ...
they will be soon .
all right , let &apos;s see &apos; em .
all right , duke , listen .
find hotel security and lock this place down .
also , find what room these guys are in .
all right .
hey , what are you guys doing here ?
room 1650 .
all right , you guys , you &apos;re with me .
jerry , stay put .
sunset design .
red and blue . that &apos;s the suit .
steve !
over there !
rock a hula , baby !
everybody get down ! down !
get down !
get down !
come here !
go ! fake elvis !
let the hostage go ! now !
look here , hoss , there &apos;s only one way
you &apos;re getting out of here alive !
nice shot , boss .
okay , take it easy .
there &apos;s $ 3 million worth of diamonds on this body , all right ?
no one &apos;s gonna say it ?
elvis has left the building .
所以每次主办单位都得宣布 &quot; 猫王已经离开大楼了 &quot;
good .
oh , jerry , by the way , i &apos;ve been meaning to ask you .
you &apos;re not one of those nuts
that thinks elvis is still alive , are you ?
course not .
no sane person believes he is .
elvis died years ago .
almost as long as paul mccartney .
what ? he &apos;s one of the two beatles
who actually is still alive .
nope . died in a car crash in &apos; 67 .
replaced with a look @-@ alike .
one very talented look @-@ alike .
come on , jer , everybody knows that &apos;s an urban legend .
what ?
what what ?
have you listened to &quot; strawberry fields &quot; ?
the evidence is all there .
john confessed .
oh , sure .
and i suppose ringo shot kennedy .
oh , do me a favor ,
don &apos;t get him started on that one , all right ?
hey , since you guys shot up the convention ,
a bunch of us are gonna continue the party over at rumfire .
who &apos;s up for a drink ?
i could use one .
yeah , as long as it &apos;s not bourbon , i &apos;m in .
okay .
you don &apos;t remember the bet ?
that was easy . well , you owe me $ 50 .
fine , that &apos;s ... just buy my drinks . that &apos;s fine .
thank you .
thanks .
hey , we got to get a drink for chin-- he &apos;s running late .
no , no , he can come in on the next round .
um , excuse me . thank you .
could i please have a longboard , when you &apos;re ready ?
she &apos;s a hostess , not the waitress , there &apos;s a big difference .
i &apos;m sorry for him .
but if you are gonna get him a beer ,
i &apos;ll have one , too .
same here .
i &apos;ll have a strawberry daiquiri .
did you say strawberry daiquiri ?
i &apos;m comfortable with my manhood , brother .
oh , yes , you are .
and deep dish pizzas ,
strawberry daiquiris , man .
you like the finer things in life .
absolutely .
well , there &apos;s jerry .
he &apos;s found his people .
you know what ? i think it &apos;s great that
he &apos;s passionate about something .
let me tell you something .
elvis presley was the greatest , okay ?
he was the king of rock and roll .
he invented rock and roll .
uh , wait , now .
he had a little help from chuck berry and little richard .
okay .
but ... you &apos;re right , there &apos;s only one king .
thanks .
okay , this is gonna happen here .
i might need a double one of these .
i can &apos;t believe chin is missing this .
they say when a star dies ,
its light continues to travel for hundreds of years .
this song goes out to one of our own .
lane collins-- though he &apos;s gone ...
his light keeps shining on us all .
* treat me like a fool *

hey , i &apos;m pulling up to the hotel now .
hello , chin . it was good seeing you this morning .
what do you want , gabriel ?
a little gratitude , for starters .
if i hadn &apos;t killed that i.a. detective ,
you &apos;d be behind bars right now .
so would you . don &apos;t even pretend you did that for me .
here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen .
i &apos;m gonna help you get off this island .
really ? and why would i do that ?
because i have something you &apos;re gonna want to see .
information that affects you very directly .
and as a show of good faith ...
i &apos;m prepared to give you a little sneak peak .
where do we meet ?
that won &apos;t be necessary .
it &apos;ll be waiting for you when you get home .
commander , what do you got ?
all clear .
only thing we found was this envelope
x @-@ rays show it &apos;s safe to open .
what is this ?
i don &apos;t know .
