第二十三季第二十集
now that &apos;s what i call going for a spin !
now that &apos;s what i call a snappy retort !
stop saying what you call things !
i &apos;m trying to watch the movie !
welcome to annual conclave of
邪恶者联盟
international brotherhood of evil .
this year &apos;s theme : &quot; evil in the age of social media . &quot;
we have prepared three breakout rooms
for small group discussion .
here , here !
these small rooms are an excellent way
for villains to mingle with super @-@ villains .
but are you sure we will not be bothered
by the american master @-@ spy stradivarius cain ?
do not worry about doctor cain .
the last i saw him , my beautiful mistress
was about to finish him off .
yes , that &apos;s what i did .
you killed him , right ?
yes , he was the perfect lover ...
of being killed !
it &apos;s a weird sentence , but let &apos;s move on .
my baker has prepared an edible monument to cain &apos;s demise .
party &apos;s over , general .
stradivarius cain ? !
no ... !
he turned that russian guy into swiss cheese !
homer !
people are here to see the movie , not listen to you !
hey , homer , great yell @-@ outs tonight !
lucky you , marge ! you get to hear &apos; em the loudest !
you &apos;ve ruined me for other men !
that &apos;s my hobby .
this is my job .
looks like that guy &apos;s got turret &apos;s syndrome !
i couldn &apos;t have thought of that in 10,000 lifetimes !
swiss cheese ...
marge , how come you &apos;re not saying anything ?
there was enough talking during the movie .
this date night was even worse than the date night
we saw date night .
oh man , marge is pissed .
look at her ... flaring her nostrils ...
drumming her fingers ...
making small noises like
she &apos;s yelling at me inside her head ...
just take me home !
that &apos;s what she said !
another good one !
you &apos;re on fire ... !
attention , students :
in order to cut down on the rash of
embarrassing youtube videos of our teachers ,
we will be scanning you and taking away your smartphones .
make sure i get this back .
a new low .
i should &apos;ve taken that superintendent job in honduras .
my own donkey , all the sugarcane i could suck ...
if only i could stomach the upside @-@ down question marks .
hey simpson . let me save you the trouble
of putting that money back in your pocket .
stupid nelson ! i hate that guy .
my mom says bullies only bully
&apos;cause they &apos;re scared .
your mom &apos;s next !
you make dumb kids , lady .
boy , homer , i gotta say ,
marge looked pretty easy on the eyes last night .
and i know eye @-@ ease !
trouble in paradise ?
no , just my marriage .
honey , it &apos;s me again .
i can &apos;t work knowing that you &apos;re mad at me .
i just wanna hear your voice .
and i &apos;m counting the minutes till the whistle blows ,
then i go to moe &apos;s , then i rush home to you .
ooh ! explain this infernal wheel to me again .
left for left , right for right !
enough of your double @-@ talk !
excellent . he &apos;s alive .
smithers , give this man one ibuprofen ,
uncoated , and send him back to his workstation .
sir , simpson has sustained a serious concussion .
recent research says you must give him time off to recover .
oh , pish .
when i was in africa , i had my skull cracked open
by cannibals , and i &apos;m still kicking !
sir , that was your partner .
you betrayed him to the cannibals .
oh , that &apos;s right .
i have his memories because i ate his brain .
mr. burns , you have to give this man something .
he could sue us for all we &apos;ve got !
fine . eight weeks off with pay .
that &apos;s a good thing .
but you said it so mean .
eight weeks paid vacation ,
and all because of a little bump on the noggin .
hey , marge , here &apos;s something that &apos;ll make you happy !
not in the mood !
no , this is really good . i ...
nelson took my lunch money again .
now , listen , lisa ...
hold that thought . i &apos;m tuning my saxophone .
sharp . flat .
sharp . flat .
no one will tell me if
i &apos;m a ghost or not !
well , i just got ...
got what , homer ?
uh ... i got ...
shelbyville radio in my car for a few minutes .
homer , i &apos;m a single mother
trying to raise a family here .
but you &apos;re not ...
just zip it !
i have eight weeks paid vacation ,
and my family doesn &apos;t know .
honey , i &apos;m off to work !
you know ...
maybe i should call in sick .
we could visit all our old romantic haunts
that have closed and turned into temporary halloween stores .
i have to take maggie for her checkup .
and a guy &apos;s coming to see what the smell is under the house .
i get it . you need your marge time .
well , i &apos;m ... off to work .
my feet hurt , and my neck is cold .
children ,
i didn &apos;t get much sleep last night ,
because i was up late again , lamenting the choices i &apos;ve made .
haw @-@ haw ! you can &apos;t change the past .
just for that , you can go to the principal &apos;s office ,
while the rest of the class enjoys ... a movie day .
krustyburger : every day thousands of people
wolf down his &quot; kwazy cuisine &quot;
thinking they &apos;re getting the nutrients
a human being needs to live .
but for 30 days , this reporter
ate nothing but this joker &apos;s deck of carbs .
do you want lies with that ?
oh great . another documentary making me look like a scuzzbag .
what is it this time ?
that the town i sponsor in africa doesn &apos;t exist ?
prove it ! film all of africa !
day twelve , i &apos;ve gained 20 pounds .
as for my cholesterol ...
it &apos;s bad . you can just scrape it right off .
but still i soldier on with my &quot; laffy meal . &quot;
hey , this is all above @-@ board .
one month of eating krustyburger
and nothing else has transformed me
into a morbidly obese , toilet @-@ busting american .
if i don &apos;t have some kind of nugget
every five minutes , i &apos;ll die .
i &apos;m so weak ...
i can &apos;t even fill out this application for &quot; documentary film oscar . &quot;
非大屠杀题材
but it &apos;ll be worth it
if my suffering teaches krusty the value of proper nutrition .
you &apos;re gonna be my breakfast english sausage !
man , when you &apos;re not at work ,
you see so many beautiful things .
and now , because it &apos;s afternoon ,
i can go to moe &apos;s without having a &quot; drinking problem . &quot;
hey , homer . i could hear your
pathetic rationalizing through the door .
well , why can &apos;t i hang out at the bar all day ?
my wife doesn &apos;t want to be with me .
look , i &apos;d love to discuss your problems ,
but a pack of raccoons took over my back room
and today &apos;s the day i make my stand .
aah ! aah ! there &apos;s more than i thought !
i wish i could pull down my zipper and that guy would come out .
stranger things have happened , homer .
stradivarius cain !
what the ... ? am i losing my marbles ?
no , i &apos;m just an illusion caused by
the concussion you suffered at the plant .
can i put my hand through you ?
if you want .
c &apos;mon ... really ?
show a little class .
sorry .
now i &apos;m about to undertake my toughest mission ever :
to make you into a man your wife can &apos;t resist .
what the ... ? no one can see you !
other people &apos;s imaginary friends can see me .
hello , dr. cain .
hello , hufnpuffalus .
sorry i slept with your girlfriend .
you did me a favor , man .
lunch money , lunch money , lunch money .
hey , lis .
nelson , don &apos;t you want my lunch money ?
nah . chicks wind up getting all your money anyway .
that &apos;s sexist , but thank you .
now i gotta go liberate some cash from your brother .
well , if you must .
see if you can find out where my dolls are .
you might not like the answer .
i just want closure .
simpson , you know why i &apos;m here .
nelson , i could give you my lunch money ...
or i could give you ...
lunch ?
actual lunch ? !
look at all them burgers and fries .
i didn &apos;t know they served these things warm !
aw ... they feel like a baby &apos;s head .
i just thank god you didn &apos;t take my coupons .
got enough for a month .
free hamburger ? !
no , you give them the coupon ,
and they give you the hamburger .
i knew that .
i must say , whoever installed
your car &apos;s secret weapons did a great job hiding them .
yeah , dr. cain , the thing about that is ...
uh , there aren &apos;t any weapons .
what ? ! well , does your car at least turn into something else ?
sometimes marge says i turn it into a trashcan .
homer , you are going to clean up this car ,
put on cologne , and become a sparkling conversationalist .
sounds like you &apos;re turning into wife number two .
i can do that .
so , stick with marge !
whoa , what &apos;s going on there , lou ?
well , if you ask me , chief ...
all right , what does this mean ?
childhood obesity ...
it &apos;s not funny anymore !
breakfast cereals where the surprise inside is diabetes
and soda cups the size of hot tubs
have made every state mississippi @-@ fat .
that &apos;s nelson !
no , you &apos;re imagining things .
what else you got ?
just bubbling oil .
stand back and give me a straw .
now , the ultimate test :
i want you to convince ... that woman
to give herself to you body and soul .
but i &apos;m a married man .
yeah , i know . a married man is never attracted
to a beautiful woman he doesn &apos;t even know ,
but this will give you the confidence you need with marge .
okay , i &apos;ll make a stranger love me forever .
and homer , remember :
it doesn &apos;t matter what you say
as long as you say it with confidence .
my dear , did you just fall from heaven ?
&apos;cause your hair looks really messed up .
okay , it matters a little what you say .
moving on ...
you know what wood makes the best ventriloquist dummy ?
maple .
how many hardboiled eggs do you think i can eat ?
look , just say this :
when i was in special ops ,
they held me in an afghan prison
where all i could see was a patch of blue sky .
but that blue was nothing compared
to the blue of your eyes .
oh ... i am a sucker for articulate fatsos .
what is this ?
i leave for two seconds to get chocolate martinis ,
and my wife is expertly seduced by this pork empanada !
what do i do ?
squirt that lemon in his eye !
you think a lemon will stop me ? !
a lime ! no ... !
did you see the guy ?
marge , what brings you to the s.n.p.p. ?
homie &apos;s been working so hard .
i thought i &apos;d bring him a special lunch .
marge , you &apos;re a blue angel .
and i &apos;m not talking &apos; about those pilots that hot dog in
an air show while the real men are in combat .
but i gotta ask : where &apos;s homer working ?
here , right ?
not since burns gave him that time off .
what is this ? week six ?
what ? !
i knew there was a reason he was leaving on time !
oh , i can &apos;t believe this !
what &apos;d you say to her ?
i don &apos;t know .
i thought i was making small talk .
but it turned out to be big talk .
what ? !
krusty !
this once @-@ vibrant young bully
won &apos;t even live to pick on kids in junior high !
because he &apos;s been eating nothing but your food !
atta boy !
got any fries , man ? i just need a couple .
not my responsibility .
he didn &apos;t have to order that crap .
we &apos;ve got yogurt and salad on the menu !
do you actually serve those items ?
no .
all right , kid , to make this right ,
i &apos;m gonna hook you up with my personal trainer .
billy , get this kid into superhero shape !
hugh jackman wolverine ?
i &apos;m not made of money .
alicia silverstone batgirl ?
he &apos;s that now .
busy day at work ?
did you get a lot of work done , workerman ?
what do i do ? what do i do ? !
take her by those shoulders she never covers
and tell her the truth .
you &apos;re right , marge , i lied .
don &apos;t give me that load of ... huh ?
i got a head injury at work ,
and they gave me eight weeks paid vacation .
head injury ? ! why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
and i spent all that time learning
how to be a better husband .
the kind of husband you deserve .
wha ... ?
kiss her . kiss her while i watch .
the three of us are going to the most romantic restaurant in town .
this car &apos;s so clean !
i &apos;m not getting flea bites on my ankles !
i have bug @-@ bombed the car for m &apos;lady .
we meet again !
looking for this ?
he won &apos;t be out for long . flee , my love !
why is he trying to kill you ,
and why did she call you her love ?
it was all a training exercise
to make me smooth for you .
of course , she fell for me ,
and of course , i wanted no part of her .
now the only one who can help us is stradivarius cain .
the guy from the movie ?
i &apos;ll explain later .
strad , come back !
i know you &apos;re in there !
no . not you .
big fan , but no .
cleatus the football robot , you &apos;re my only hope !
no one likes you !
how can a fat man hide so well ?
strad , where are you ?
you can handle him , homer .
just remember what i taught you .
when i was in special ops ,
they held me in an afghan prison
where all i could see was a patch of blue sky .
but that blue was nothing compared
with the blue of your eyes .
i cannot kill a poet like you .
and you are a very lucky woman .
this is why i always say &quot; mingle at parties . &quot;
it &apos;s how i met greg kinnear .
ay ! with the greg kinnear again .
can &apos;t friends talk about friends ?
he is not your friend !
then why did he say
he &apos;d call me when he comes to bolivia ?
we used to be like them .
so , how many more weeks do you have off ?
actually , i was supposed to be back last week .
we &apos;ll just wait for the call from human resources .
i guess my work here is done .
but stradivarius cain will return in
&quot; lisa gets a b plus . &quot;
i knew you were mad at me .
at the risk of inflaming sister fate ,
this bully @-@ free period has been an arcadian idyll !
here , here !
idyll !
i administer with this nose .
this is a happy ending ?
well , he &apos;s tough on nerds , but easy on the eyes .
what &apos;d you just say ?
