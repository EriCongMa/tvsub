okay , chestnut , it &apos;s time to play that game
where we take shots while we pay our bills
that max so cleverly named ,
&quot; that game where we take shots while we pay our bills . &quot;
hey , if you want me to think of a better name ,
we should probably stop taking shots while we pay our bills .
if this bill says first warning ,
we take a shot , and chestnut gets a carrot .
if it &apos;s a final notice ,
chestnut gets two carrots , and we take a double shot .
and if it &apos;s gone into collections ,
we shoot ourselves , and chestnut gets three carrots .
and also , i &apos;m gonna take shots whenever i want to .
all right , only a couple bills to go
and $ 149 to pay them .
that &apos;s an odd number . shots !
man , our electric bill is $ 72 .
that &apos;s an even number . shots !
next up , i have gas .
ah , thanks for the heads @-@ up this time .
we have $ 77 , and the bill &apos;s only $ 76.84 .
numbers ! shots !
this is the first time we &apos;ve ever broken even .
wait , what do we do when we break even ?
shots ?
i &apos;m so proud we paid all our bills
and with actual american dollars this time .
there might &apos;ve been a couple of pesos in the mix ,
that or the nickel has a sweet new donkey .
look , girls , i got the new iphone ,
and siri thinks i &apos;m hilarious .
i hear that phone has a great camera for selfies
or , in your case , elfies .
smile , max .
nice . # willdiealone .
oh , already got a like .
hey , everybody .
big news .
i finally met the man of my dreams .
sophie , that &apos;s not news . you &apos;ve known me for years .
oh , earl , another place ,
another time , another woman ,
another man .
hey , girls , you better wipe down my booth .
my boyfriend &apos;s parking his lincoln outside .
yeah , he dropped me off first &apos; cause he &apos;s a class act
and &apos; cause he had to put his pants back on .
there she is . there &apos;s my peanut .
you hear that ? he calls me his peanut .
holy crap ,
she &apos;s looking even prettier than the last time i saw her .
what &apos;d you do ,
get some beauty creams on the way from the car to the diner ?
oh , maybe .
sophie , it &apos;s nice to see you so giddy about something .
yeah , you &apos;re like me sitting on
that broken washer at the laundromat .
i &apos;m nicky , but my friends call me
when they need money .
i &apos;m caroline . this is max .
i &apos;m gonna ask you the same question
i ask every guy around your age .
are you my dad ?
maybe one of you dolls can get me
a glass of water to wash down my tums ?
sexy and he has an ulcer .
sure , i &apos;ll go get you some menus and the wine list .
don &apos;t get excited .
that &apos;s just a list of everything
caroline &apos;s whined about in the last year .
what &apos;s up with robert de zero over there ?
i used to have a leather jacket like that .
then i realized , when you have the right to bear arms ,
you bare them , baby .
omelet . pick up .
i think oleg just got jealous .
i think oleg just got underarm dandruff in these eggs .
enjoy .
here are your menus ,
and we &apos;re out of everything in the pictures since 1974 .
so the little girl smiling eating a waffle ,
she &apos;s a grandma now , and she calls penn station home .
here you go , dolls , for your trouble .
100 bucks ? it &apos;s like free money .
can you imagine what he would &apos;ve given us
if the glasses were clean ?
all this money and i didn &apos;t even do anything .
i &apos;m one mustache away from being a kardashian .
yeah , nicky &apos;s a big @-@ shot bookie
with a yorkie and a membership
to the vip lounge at the race track .
a yorkie and a green leather jacket ?
are you even real ?
i love horse racing .
i used to go to the track all the time ,
and not to brag , but i do own a thoroughbred .
oh , yeah , she does .
i see it eating out of the garbage can from my window .
here , that &apos;s chestnut .
that &apos;s a beauty ,
but not as much a beauty as my peanut right here .
oh , he just compared me to a horse ,
but i like it anyway .
why don &apos;t you two dolls join us
at the track &apos;s turf club some afternoon ?
oh , we &apos;re busy , and it &apos;s all the way out in--
are you paying ?
of course .
oh , then we &apos;re there .
in fact , can we go right now ?
yeah , we &apos;re not doing anything .
max , look , the turf club .
us way up here ,
the horses down there on the track
being forced into their starting gates .
this is so exciting .
girl , we &apos;ve been here 30 seconds ,
and you already blew your bugle .
pace yourself .
max , caroline ,
over here !
wow , i haven &apos;t seen sophie this happy
since that girl slipped on the ice
in front of our building .
that girl was me , max ,
and i really hurt my coccyx .
you have a coccyx ? you want to go out sometime ?
hey , girls .
come on , peanut . get a little closer to me .
closer . little closer .
closer . little closer .
what can i say , girls ? i can &apos;t get close enough .
do you hear that ? he can &apos;t get close enough .
thank you so much for inviting us .
it feels great to be back at the track again .
ah , horse racing is , after all ,
the sport of kings .
i &apos;m more interested in the sport of king crab legs right over there .
so is this an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat deal here ,
or will a waiter come drag me away ?
knock yourself out .
how much could a girl like you possibly eat ?
you know how a cobra can swallow an entire pig ?
it &apos;s like that .
hey , caroline , you want two or three ?
so max tells me you met
at 24 hour fitness 24 hours ago .
yup , he spotted me in a handstand .
nicky , who am i gonna bet on ?
who do you like , besides me ?
sophie , go with mess in a dress .
she had great morning sprints ,
first @-@ time blinkers ,
jockey weighed in a pound under ,
and at the preakness ,
she was second in seven furlongs ,
and this race is only six furlongs .
yeah , you &apos;re talking for long .
yeah , i think i &apos;m gonna go with number three ,
my uncle hank .
my uncle hank ?
he &apos;s out of jail ?
yeah , we should probably eat this and head out .
oh , see , that &apos;s my horse .
my horse , uncle hank .
and look , see ? he just pooped .
he &apos;s trying to get away from it .
i know about that . that &apos;s how i am .
okay , got to make the donuts , but first ,
give me that kisses , sister .
aw , so romantic .
max , maybe we should get in on the action .
nah , that &apos;s a lot of tongue for me .
no , i meant place a bet .
and , max , i think i &apos;m in a three @-@ way .
well , you look exactly the way i imagined
you &apos;d look in a three @-@ way--reading .
come on , we have that free money ,
and you love to gamble .
yeah , but nothing stupid , just , like , not using a condom .
oh , what the hell ?
wait , wait , nicky , nicky , here .
here &apos;s your money . 200 on mess in a dress .
oh , wait , i think i have a mess in my dress .
you got it , doll ,
and i &apos;m sending over some of those special popovers .
sophie , make sure you get one .
oh , do you hear that ?
there &apos;s gonna be a ring in one of those popovers .
i didn &apos;t hear any of that .
well , why else would someone order popovers
unless they were gonna hide a ring in it ?
i just ate the entire cast of finding nemo .
i &apos;m not saying i &apos;m sick .
i &apos;m just saying that clown fish wants out .
afternoon , ladies . enjoy the popovers .
and are you finished with that ?
ah , let &apos;s just say it &apos;s finished with me .
and they &apos;re off .
this is so exciting .
i know . i wonder which one it &apos;s in .
oh . oh , not that one .
all right . whoops , not that one .
look , look , there &apos;s our horse ,
mess in a dress .
she &apos;s in the lead .
oh , no , not that one .
yes , yes , yes .
no , no , no .
and the winner is mess in a dress .
we won ! we won .
are we being winners right now ?
i don &apos;t know how to be that .
suddenly i don &apos;t know what to do with my hands .
nothing .
i mean , who in the hell would order popovers
and not hide a diamond ring in it ?
here you go , dolls . 6 big ones .
max , this is incredible .
we had 200 , and now we have 600 .
even more free money .
and , waiter , bring my peanut one of those banana splits .
you hear that ?
there &apos;s a diamond ring
in the bottom of the banana split .
and , leon , for your trouble .
really ? 100 ?
yup , i was a waitress before i was rich .
and also after that fish ,
i might need you to carry me to the subway .
whoever that is going through my pants ,
you should know i have a gun .
max , it &apos;s me , caroline .
why do you think i bought the gun ?
okay , max , you know how today we won 600 on our 200
after just that one horse race ?
yeah , that was weird , but not as weird
as waking up to see you standing in the dark
going to third base with my pants .
if i bet our winnings with the three @-@ to @-@ one odds
on this horse tomorrow ,
do you know how much i can make us ?
let &apos;s see . 2 , carry the 1--get out .
i have the racing form right back here .
don &apos;t bring that over here . that &apos;s been in your crack .
see ? right here .
first race tomorrow-- there she blows .
if she &apos;s blowing that early in the morning ,
she deserves our money .
i &apos;ve done all the research
and checked it with chestnut .
it &apos;s a sure thing , like the sun coming up tomorrow
成为第一位获得奥斯卡提名的索马里演员
or that somali pirate
never getting another acting job again .
you go out and get addicted to horse racing
after i worked so hard to put pills and weed on the table ?
i am not addicted .
now , where &apos;s your cash ?
&apos;cause it wasn &apos;t in your piggy bank ,
which someone-- not me--broke .
you think you don &apos;t have a problem ?
then , fine , you can have the money .
you won &apos;t be sorry . where is it ?
in my bra .
where &apos;s your bra ?
on my boobs .
you sleep in your bra ?
have to .
last time i let them out at night ,
they didn &apos;t come home till 4 a.m.
and couldn &apos;t tell me where they &apos;d been .
max , just take it out of there , please .
nope , i &apos;ll tell you what i tell every guy
who wants to get in there .
it &apos;s 12 bucks for adults and 10.50 for seniors .
fine , i &apos;m doing this for both of us .
still think you don &apos;t have a problem ?
geez , where is it ?
is there a map or a tour guide ?
coming up on your left . you &apos;re about 20 minutes away .
it &apos;s quite a walk . you might want to take the tram .
got it .
feel good about yourself ?
i will after that race tomorrow .
and i promise i &apos;ll never do that again .
that &apos;s what my uncle hank said .
no , i meant i &apos;ll never ask you for money again .
that &apos;s what uncle hank &apos;s wife said .
no more gambling .
now i feel like you read the transcript of uncle hank &apos;s case .
oh , wait , you forgot some .
just kidding , it &apos;s late , and it felt kind of good .
max , i hope caroline gets here soon ,
&apos;cause if that girl walks in one full hour late ,
i &apos;ll have to respect the hell out of her .
she &apos;s still at the track ,
and i &apos;m dying to know how our horse did .
so much suspense .
i feel like i should be peeing on a stick .
you girls are still playing the horses .
keep that in check .
my gambling problem got so bad
i couldn &apos;t even afford my drug problem .
you &apos;re back ! so how did we do ?
we did great .
we won our bet on there she blows .
yes ! how much did we get ?
are we talking &quot; add avocado &quot; money ?
well , we did do great , and then we did not great .
and then we did bad , and then we did real bad .
and then we did terrible .
long story short , i &apos;m out of tums ,
and we owe nicky $ 3,000 .
you--you owe nicky .
when i got addicted to pizza pringles ,
i didn &apos;t make it your problem .
your breath made it all our problems .
max , nicky &apos;s not , like , dangerous , is he ?
i bet he &apos;s not , but even if he is ,
don &apos;t worry .
you can survive in the trunk of lincoln
for five , six days easy .
max , i know i can make all of this money back
if i just win one more race .
i just need a sure thing .
there is no such thing as a sure thing ,
except my mother never picking me up from school .
look , there are two horses tomorrow that look really good ,
buck that and little house on the gary .
little house on the gary -- that &apos;s my friend eddie &apos;s horse .
we don &apos;t have time to pretend
you have a friend named eddie right now .
i do . eddie jones .
he &apos;s a famous jockey . we met at the tailor .
we got to talking as we were both having our jeans hemmed .
where &apos;d you buy them , j.c.puny ?
han , please , you have to help me .
you have to talk to your friend eddie
and get me the scoop on the race tomorrow .
okay , i &apos;ll help on one condition :
no more short jokes from max .
she can do that .
you can do that , right , max ? don &apos;t answer .
so no more short jokes starting right--
okay , wait , but first ,
didn &apos;t i see you on a baby food jar ?
a mouse set a trap for you .
and don &apos;t you have to bring a ring to mordor ?
okay , let &apos;s do this .
eddie said he &apos;d meet us down here .
han , i really appreciate this .
you &apos;re doing me such a big , big favor .
yeah , and we &apos;re surprised you can do anything big .
okay , that &apos;s it .
han , wait .
i don &apos;t need it !
max , see what you did ?
what ? i was on autopilot .
what did i say ?
han , please , max won &apos;t say anything .
good , &apos; cause i &apos;ve had it up to here .
you don &apos;t have it up to there .
don &apos;t need it !
max !
please , you have to stop with the short jokes .
this is my life .
but that &apos;s my life .
keep it up , and i &apos;m gonna be at the bottom of the east river
with that hipster artisan cheese truck
you pushed off the brooklyn bridge .
you &apos;re right . no more short jokes .
maybe i should wait outside .
so , han , where &apos;s eddie ?
i think we should talk to him as quickly as possible
before max passes out .
i don &apos;t see him . i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be here shortly .
and i just bit the inside of my mouth .
hey , it &apos;s han !
i haven &apos;t seen you since we took our little trip .
no , man , i saw you after my small business
owners softball game .
hey , i got new car , a mini cooper .
this is hell . i &apos;m in hell .
eddie , hi ,
is there anything you can tell me about today &apos;s race ?
is there a sure thing ?
oh , you get yourself a bad bet ?
bad bet and beyond .
well , let me give you a little tip .
i &apos;ll be outside .
and coming down the home stretch ,
little house on the gary has the lead .
come on , little house on the gary !
run ! run like caroline after sundown
in an ethnic neighborhood .
the hoof , the hoof , the hoof is on fire !
he &apos;s winning . he &apos;s winning .
he &apos;s winning !
oh , no , what &apos;s happening ?
he &apos;s falling behind .
oh , lord . oh , my sweet , sweet lord .
he &apos;s losing . he &apos;s losing .
he &apos;s losing .
han , what is happening ?
well , maybe i &apos;ll take off .
your friend said it was a sure thing .
there is no sure thing
except another taylor swift breakup song .
and little house on the gary
falls to pieces as falls to pieces wins .
so what do we win if our horse finishes last
and wanders around the track with a giant erection ?
all that and we lost ?
thanks for lunch .
han , you &apos;re so small your house is a tic tac box .
you &apos;re so small you ride in your car cupholder .
you &apos;re so small your parents
are a ladybug and a tater tot .
i could see that , actually .
i don &apos;t need it !
you see , caroline ?
this is why i quit gambling ,
this and the escalator was always broken .
all right , let &apos;s just calm down .
this is the turf club , not goodfellas ,
though that was placed on real @-@ life events
and took place not that far from here .
right , and maybe he won &apos;t be so hard on us .
nicky is sophie &apos;s boyfriend .
well , i just broke up with nicky .
why ?
i just saw him beat the crap out of some guy that owed him money .
oh , no , here he comes .
there you are , dolls .
my leg is next .
tough break .
i &apos;m gonna take my 3 grand and go .
peanut just broke up with me ,
so i &apos;m gonna go home
and get in bed with my dog and my wife .
i have to come clean . we don &apos;t have your money .
i got out of control .
doll , relax . i &apos;m a reasonable man .
we can work out something .
oh , good .
hope he shoots me first .
i &apos;d rather be dead than hear you beg .
still got that thoroughbred ?
i &apos;ll come by tomorrow to get it .
he can &apos;t take my horse .
what am i gonna do ?
you can always move to new york and change your name to max .
wait , i already did that .
what is wrong with me ?
i should have known better .
my father has problems with money .
it &apos;s in my dna .
and now all because of a stupid bet ,
i &apos;m gonna lose chestnut .
if it makes you feel any better ,
my mom once lost me in a bet .
still can &apos;t believe she thought robert redford was in tootsie .
罗伯特 · 雷德福 美国男演员 并未出演该电影
we can &apos;t lose chestnut .
damn it , damn it , damn it , people .
make me come out of retirement
just save your gambling asses .
now , all i need is 100 bucks .
hey , caroline , how fast can you have a baby ?
hey . hi , leon .
remember us , the ones who tipped you 100 bucks ?
oh , of course , it &apos;s hard to find
that kind of generosity in this place .
it gives you hope again .
yeah , we &apos;re gonna need that back .
well , actually , i need all my money .
i support my mother .
yeah , maybe not today .
max , i can &apos;t believe it .
i screwed me and the horse i rode in on .
why don &apos;t you film that and get your money back ?
caroline , look .
earl , you did it .
you saved chestnut .
yeah , well , we brown studs
have to stick together .
and i &apos;ll take that .
and since i don &apos;t trust myself ,
i &apos;m donating this 200 to my favorite charity ,
so here .
now , no more betting ,
&apos;cause the only sure thing in life is death .
have a nice day .
one for you , and one for me .
200 , we &apos;re back to our free money ,
and this time , it &apos;s going right in the savings account .
well , it &apos;s not earning much interest in there .
here .
we &apos;re keeping this in a bank with two major branches .
