Will you tell?
No. No.
Please.
Will you tell?!
No.
This is all your fault.
I'm sorry, Mr. Stanley.
I never expected so many customers.
Yeah?
You and your menu additions are making my life hell, Rizzoli.
Hey, hey, hey, zip it.
And it's Mrs. Rizzoli to you, Stanley.
That's it.
You gave me too much.
No, that's -- that's okay. That's for you.
Thank you. Have a good day.
You're running this morning. Come on.
You're too late. I already showered.
Last night or this morning?
Never mind. Let's go.
No, I-I can't. My stomach's full.
Jane, you need endorphins from physical activity...
because you're depressed.
I'm not depressed.
See?
You'll get over Casey.
Who said it had anything to do with Casey?
I-I got a new... ding in my car door.
You lied. Your left eyebrow moved.
You are in stage four of the five stages of relationship grief.
I am in stage five of ignoring you.
I can't taste, touch, smell...
see, or hear you.
Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance.
A good run will get you to acceptance.
Why'd she have to make bunnies?
Mnh-mnh. I like them bunnies.
Taste better when they got a shape.
You know what? Take these, too.
You sure?
Yeah.
'cause I don't want you losing any more weight.
You know, I like my detectives with a little meat on them.
Rizzoli, get over here.
We're too busy for table service.
I was just getting a to-go container for this gentleman.
You heard that? Gentleman.
Rondo, hurry.
You've been giving free food to Rondo,
and that's why the sandwiches cost 12 bucks.
I take it out of my tip money, detective.
That man's been through a lot.
Leave him alone.
Oh. We got a murder.
You gonna run to the crime scene?
Five minutes.
Three.
Read my lips.
Get your ass back in the seat and get this bus in service.
Nobody tells me when to drive.
He's a transit cop. It's not even his crime scene.
It's ours.
I know him -- Arite Mcmurphy
He's always irritable.
His wife ran off with her boyfriend years ago
or maybe died, something like that.
Something like that?
Yeah, I think they had a kid.
So you two were close.
Must have been 10 years ago.
No, had to be 20. I was still in the drug unit.
Let me know if you need help finding your car.
Oh. She looks like some... big weird doll.
Dame de voyage.
Why are we speaking French?
Sex dolls originated in the 17th century.
Randy sailors took them on lonely voyages.
But this might be agalmatophilia.
Anything ending in "philia" is not gonna be good.
A fetish involving the love between a man and a doll.
A man, a doll, his love, and what?
A 2x4? A hammer? Hockey stick?
Definitely a solid high-density object.
In common parlance, something hard.
That's a brilliant deduction.
Her wrists were bound to something.
There was no cast-off or blood spatter.
She wasn't killed here. Nice scrunchie.
Yeah, her clothes are very early '90s, too.
More formal before sweeping changes to fashion made grunge chic.
And you're telling me this because why?
She was transported here from the '90s?
Uh, no, detective smarty pants.
Because her clothes are 20 years old,
and they don't fit her.
Hey, sorry I'm late. Breakfast line was long.
Got to help your mom set up that online ordering.
All right, as soon as you're
done swallowing the Peter Rabbit pancake,
can you go through the suitcase, please?
This is too easy.
It's all here -- driver's license,
bus pass, cash, phone.
Victoria Green. She's 25.
She lived in Brighton.
Okay. Not so easy.
She password-protected her phone.
Hmm, okay.
So, she was probably killed wearing that.
The killer redressed her in those clothes.
And posed her on a bus bench.
So we're not looking for just any old killer.
We're looking for a freak with a doll fetish.
Where is Korsak?
Is the owner chasing you?
I'm just gonna head on back
- you're not going anywhere until you tell us
what you're doing with that dog.
How did you rip your pants?
Oh, man. These are new.
Yeah, new in 1995.
Stealing somebody's dog is a felony.
I didn't steal her.
I'm just taking care of Barney Miller
until I can find her a good home.
Barney Miller?
She was... I rescued her.
She was trapped and crying. Somebody abandoned her.
I'm not visiting you when they send you to Walpole.
I will. I will visit you.
There are remnants of a subdural hematoma
just above the right ear.
She was knocked out with what?
And don't say "something hard."
It was hard.
But the extent of the damage
makes it impossible to determine the type of instrument used.
Was she raped?
Doubtful.
There's no evidence of trauma, tearing, or bruising.
Doubtful? So you found something.
Well, she did have sex within the last 36 hours.
Okay, what's with the creepy doll makeup?
It was applied postmortem.
See the blood under the makeup?
Mm-hmm. Maybe a sex game gone wrong?
Well, the killer did exhibit a certain degree of tenderness.
Oh, yeah, real tender, starting with tenderizing her head.
Got a suspect -- Herbert Buckley.
Served two years on an a&b,
released two months ago.
He liked to hire hookers and make them pretend they were dolls.
And hit them in the head with a crowbar. Nice.
Can you use Frankie?
I'm just not up for a pervert today.
See you, Maura.
Psst! Hey, doc.
What? Sergeant Korsak. Are you all right?
I was, uh, wondering if, uh --
if you could give a friend of mine a little checkup?
Here?
There's no such thing as a little checkup.
I'd have to
Hello.
Man, this is a downer.
Herbert goes at Marlene all the time.
She never called the cops before.
Who's Marlene?
Herbert's old lady.
Yeah, you bet I'm frustrated!
I got mushrooms on my burger, and I hate them!
That would be Herbert.
And now you got sprouts all in my ketchup!
Stay back.
I'm going left. You take right.
Boston police, freeze.
No. No, no. We were just talking.
We were just working through our issues.
Baby, I love you. I would never hurt you. Tell them.
Are you hurt?
No.
We were just working on our relationship.
I-I wasn't gonna hit her.
Uh...oh, hey, easy, bro. Don't, uh...cry.
It's Marlene.
She hates to be alone. I can't leave her alone.
Take her, Frankie.
I don't know where she's been. You take her.
Barney Miller is in excellent health.
Watch this.
Bring me my keys, Barney Miller.
Bring me my keys.
Oh. Thank you.
Turn off the lights.
Turn off the lights, Barney Miller.
Good girl. Yeah.
Look what I found.
Oh, an RFID scanner.
Thanks, Susie.
Well, if Barney Miller is chipped,
this will tell us who she belongs to.
She's registered to the truce veteran center.
Are you a service dog, Barney?
That's why you know all those tricks.
I guess a wounded warrior needs you more than I do.
Yeah.
Why don't I take Barney Miller home?
Spare you that.
Would you? I don't think I can do it.
Goodbye, girl.
Oh, wait. Uh, Barney Miller.
Elsie?
Good girl.
Look at you.
Maura.
Casey.
Hi.
Hi.
How'd you get your collar off again?
Sergeant Korsak found her not too far from here.
Is she yours?
Uh, she's, um -- she's one of our service dogs.
As you can see, she's pretty adept at opening doors.
You have cauda equina syndrome, don't you?
How did it happen?
Roadside bomb.
I'm partially paralyzed.
A colleague of mine is heading up the Boston Clinical Trials
for a new spinal-regeneration technique.If...
I know. I'm on the waiting list.
You should tell Jane.
No. And you won't, either -- ever.
You have to promise me that.
I don't know that I can make that promise.
She's my friend.
If you're her friend, you won't tell her.
Casey, a lot of couples
cope with very serious war injuries.
Yeah, hang out with me here,
meet some of those couples.
See what an injury like mine
does to girlfriends, wives, families.
Jane is suffering.
It's mean not to tell her.
The truth is easier than what she's imagining.
I came back here
to see if I could get into the clinical trials.
I didn't come back for Jane.
Just finished interrogating Herbert.
That is one very strange man...and woman.
Herbert was looking pretty good for it until the landlord said
old Herb was yelling at Marlene all night.
Hey. Excuse me.
That's my chair you're sit-- god!
What is --
That is not funny! Who put that there?
That is Marlene, Herb's old lady.
Get it out of my chair.
Oh, man. - What? What's -- what's wrong with you?
Barney Miller's gone.
Aww! Don't be sad.
Marlene is winking at you.
She might like leashes, too.
Show some respect.
To a mannequin?
To Elsie.
That's Barney Miller's real name.
You knew that dog for two hours.
She works with vets
struggling with PTSD at...
At?
At, uh, the program where
Lieutenant Colonel Jones works.
Really? Yeah, well, that's -- that's interesting.
Herb is downstairs crying like a baby.
He's wrapped himself around the security station.
He won't leave without... Marlene.
Don't let the size-2 jeans fool you.
That bitch is heavy.
Wow! Marlene's no cheap date, either.
8 grand?
Damn!
Of course, if you amortize, that might be cheaper than a wife.
Plus, you get a woman who doesn't talk.
Oh, great. Thank you, Moe, Curly, Larry.
Excuse me, Curly, could you take Marlene out of here, please?
Certainly.
And you, Larry,
did you unlock the password on victim's smartphone yet?
Can't crack the password, but I'll keep trying.
What about you, Moe?
Monthly bus pass won't tell us anything.
Bcat doesn't track usage.
16 bytes per sector are
reserved for keys and access conditions
and cannot normally be used for user data.
Beep. I am a robot.
Beep. I do not... compute human talk.
I do not use that inflection.
And that is the storage space on a Bcat card.
That's riveting.
I'm going to the gym.
And even though you're rude, you're coming with me.
No. Thank you. I'm too tired to work out.
Then let's go to the Dirty Robber.
I'll even have a beer with you.
No, I'm gonna go work out on my couch.
Five stages of junk food.
Uh, uh, I mentioned Casey.
You think that's what's got her down?
I'd only be guessing.
Hey, come see what Detective Frost set up for me.
Now all my customers can order online.
Oh, wow. This is great.
I'm worried about Jane.
It's as bad as when
Andrew Spagnola broke her heart
at the shining star prom.
You have to swear that you will never mention to Jane
what I'm about to tell you.
That's, uh, "Gray's Anatomy."
对圣经发誓即对自己的良心发誓
Swear, Angela.
I swear my lips are sealed.
I went to see Casey.
Okay. I can't tell you.
No.
I promise. Talk.
He's partially paralyzed.
He doesn't want Jane to know.
Partially paralyzed?
Does that mean he can't have children?
Angela.
What?
I want a grandkid, and Jane is -- is crazy for him.
There is a small chance that he may regain function someday,
but he's -- he's pretty resolute.
He doesn't want to see her.
Well, then he's a fool.
I could tell she really liked him.
I think she loves him.
Man, you still haven't cracked the password on her phone?
Thanks.
Give it up.
Hey, maybe the D.O.J. will let you borrow that kid
that hacked into the pentagon.
I'll get it.
While you were playing with that cellphone,
I did some actual work.
I went to Victoria's apartment.
Locked up tight, nothing disturbed.
She moved here from Atlanta to take a job
at an accounting firm -- Ron Montgomery Associates.
Is her office anywhere near where we found her body?
No. Castlegate towers in Jamaica Plain.
And we don't know where
she was last seen?
Nope.
She had a bus pass. You look at the bus drivers on the route
between her office and her apartment?
No! Gee!
Didn't think of that.
Yes, I checked the route she might have taken
and all 73 others.
Drivers working that day and night checked out.
Oh, yeah! Yes!
I am good. I'm finally in.
I think I know why our victim was deleting all her texts. Uh-oh.
Yeah, she was a sexter.
And she was sexting with someone named "R."
Oh, my. "R" wasn't shy, was he?
Must be running for congress.
"R" for Ron?
Ron Montgomery Associates?
"Ron Montgomery runs a family company
with family friendly values."
I remember when that meant
you weren't a pervert.
She was new, but she was a good employee.
You send your picture to all your good employees?
Oh, that.
Uh, uh, no, we were -- we were just having some innocent fun.
Yeah, looks real innocent.
No. I didn't do that.
I-I-I could never do something like that.
But you did have sex with her, didn't you?
No. No, we didn't. I'm married.
And we have evidence that Victoria had sex with someone
the day she died.
You have evidence?
Yeah, a little semen.
Which is full of DNA, so why don't we just
do a cheek swab and make sure it's not your DNA.
Okay. No, we had sex. We had sex.
It was consensual
and it was on her lunch hour.
'Cause you can't have her fooling around on company time.
She was lonely. It wasn't serious.
It is now. When did you leave work?
Um... I left before she did.
You -- you can check with security.
I used my key card in the parking garage.
Where did you go after that?
Straight home.
We've got another one.
Probably happened last night.
Get Frankie. Check those security tapes in his building.
Make sure his story checks out.
More '90s clothing.
It takes a lot of rage to do that to somebody's head.
Blunt-force trauma. Hmm. Remarkable.
It is the same.
What? Same weapon?
Same scrunchie.
So our victims were either transported from the '90s
or they work for Hillary Clinton
or our killer was a scrunchie freak.
All her I.D., bus pass.
Diane Campbell.
She lived downtown on Tremont Street.
Well, that's nowhere near
where our first victim lived or worked.
Nowhere near here, either.
Yeah, no wonder they're scared.
Somebody's hunting young women.
Hey, can I get my bagel toasted?
I rue the day I gave you a job, Rizzoli --
rue it.
You hear me?
Uh, you ordered some coffee? Yeah.
No one is using my online menu.
I'm gonna lose my job.
The traffic isn't getting on to the interweb roads.
How do I do that?
Okay, uh, don't panic.
People are attracted to sites that have a gimmick or content.
You mean like a raffle for a steak dinner
or a Bahamas getaway?
You'll be on permanent getaway
if you don't stop talking with the customers.
I was thinking something more along the lines of a blog.
Something people see every day.
You think I'm gonna see my food sometime this year?
Yes, of course, sir.
Hey, ma.
I thought you said things were gonna go faster in here.
We were just working out a few glitches.
Mm-hmm. Right.
So, did our sexter's story check out?
And what was on the security tapes?
Frankie's still looking.
Frost, doesn't it feel like we're missing something?
Time of death for both victims was around midnight.
The cause of death sure looks the same.
We got the doll pose, the makeup,
the '90s clothing, suitcases.
But they had nothing in common.
I mean, the only link is the monthly bus passes,
but they didn't take the same buses,
and all the drivers were clean.
Wait a minute. What about the passengers?
What if the killer is riding the bus
and randomly targeting young working women?
Thanks, ma.
Yep, that's Ronnie the sexter, all right,
Driving out of his business's garage at 7:58.
Nice work, Frankie.
What's so nice about it?
It just confirms the guy's story.
Frankie's good at this. He's got more.
Wait for it.
And we're waiting for what?
A 21-gun salute
because you did a little detective work?
I'm doing a lot of detecting work
for someone who doesn't have his gold badge.
Hmm, I think I detect some whining.
This is from a security camera
across the street from Montgomery's office building.
Wow. So, we get to watch him drive out from a different angle.
You know what I love about you?
You're always so up-beat and supportive.
You see that?
Ron Montgomery pulls up in front just as Victoria,
victim number one, leaves the building.
Yeah, then they argue...right here.
Hmm. He's got some game.
Looks like she's giving in.
And getting in his car.
So Ron Montgomery's not only a cheater.
He's also a liar.
Look, when I heard that Victoria was dead,
I-I didn't want to be involved.
Oh, okay. No worries. You're not involved.
You were the last one seen with
a woman who was found with her skull bashed in.
We're so sorry to bother you.
How about her?
Were you not involved with her, either?
What are you doing? I-I don't even know who that is.
I didn't do that.
Why were you fighting with Victoria the night she was murdered?
She found out that I'm not really separated.
And I was giving her a ride home,
trying to explain, but she was so upset.
She made me pull over near Allendale circle
and she got out of the car,
and that's the last time that I saw her.
That's miles from where Victoria lived.
And then where'd you go?
The Blue Tassel.
Uh, I was there... I was there till closing.
Ask the bartender, Ned.
Make yourself comfortable.
We'll be back.
There she goes.
Not sure how far, though. Look at those heels.
Bartender confirms Ronnie boy was there till 2 in the morning.
Hey, wait. Look.
She took a bus.
I think our bus theory is back.
I checked the backgrounds on all the bus drivers,
but I think I'll go have a face-to-face with that one.
You remember her?
She's the girl on the news.
Always got on at Forest Hills, but the other night,
I picked her up on Allendale.
Where were you two nights ago?
Got pulled off my route at 10:00
to fill in on the 117 bus in east Boston.
Worked until 1:00 in the morning. You can check.
Thank you.
Hello, Vanilla.
Angela's guardians?
Mrs. Vanilla takes good care of us,
so when she put out the call...
Uh, call? What call?
To protect the young women of the city,
make the buses safe again.
Why is my mother in the middle of everything?
Maura's found something big.
Just be safe.
This was embedded
in the parietal lobe of Diane Campbell's brain.
A piece of a toothpick?
Big splinter.
I am prepared to say it is a sliver of wood.
Yeah, korsak, how could you
possibly think that a sliver was a splinter?
See this?
This stain is actually from two blood types --
AB-positive,
which matches victim number one, Victoria Green,
and O-negative,
which is a match with victim number two, Diane Campbell.
So the splinter --
Precise terminology.
Is the sliver from the murder weapon?
Oh, doesn't that look like her "I've got a secret" face.
I found a third blood type.
You want us to believe
there are three types of blood on that sliver?
Well, it is a big sliver.
And one other thing.
The third blood sample is 20 years old.
Have you been drinking?
Yes. Water.
Two liters a day, as recommended by the Mayo Clinic.
You couldn't possibly tell how old that speck of blood is.
Yes, I can. It's simple.
A laser excites the tryptophan until it fluoresces.
Ticktock.
Well, you asked.
Jane, that sliver could be a piece of the murder weapon.
That our killer used on someone else 20 years ago.
You got enough for a DNA profile?
I have the results from the trace section.
Oh, thank you.
The sliver is white ash.
So...we could be looking for a club made of white ash?
Our old nightsticks were white ash.
You think we're looking for a cop?
Who else is a young woman gonna trust, right?
Someone in a uniform.
These were phased out, but I kept mine.
So did a lot of guys.
We'd be looking at an old-timer,
maybe retired,
someone with a history of violence.
No, we didn't find anything in cold cases,
and there were no murders with a similar M.O. in NCIC
for the past 20 years.
I'll check on any cop who went to prison for assaults on women
or any domestic violence.
Right. And maybe our killer's been released. He's back at it.
When I first come on the job,
had to just about kill your wife to get charged with anything.
How many guys we tell to
take a walk around the block to cool off?
Had to see them punch the old lady.
The old lady?
Sorry. It was 30 years ago. I am sorry.
I had this little trick
where I used to piss off the old man
so he'd come at me.
Gave me a chance to discipline him.
Hmm, you provoke the wife-beaters
into picking on someone their own size.
Ah, well, sometimes they were bigger.
I've been thinking about what you said about him being tender.
Casey?
Yeah, casey.
No, Maura, the killer.
And stop saying that name.
Exposure therapy might help you get over...Casey.
Casey. Casey.
Stop it!
I'm just trying to help.
If you want to play shrink, help me come up
with a psychological profile of this killer.
He's dissociated from reality.
He's constructed a world
in which an act of extreme violence...
Violently smashing women's heads in with a nightstick.
...is followed by a tender expression of love.
Yeah, tenderly slapping on pancake makeup
and making them wear ugly-ass clothes.
Come on. I just got my heart rate up.
He dresses his victims up in 20-year-old clothes.
Maura, you found 20-year-old blood.
That feels rather significant.
You think we ran long enough to need a shower?
Oh, gosh darn it.
I didn't get an endorphin hit yet.
That was a short run.
I'm a fast runner. I thought of something.
What do we have on the cop theory.
We looked at all cops fired for domestic violence
over the last 20 years -- nothing that fits.
Only found a few ex-cops doing time,
and none of them were released within the last year.
Okay, I think our killer is re-enacting a murder
he committed 20 years ago.
Put on WZJT.
Our young ladies are being stalked by a deranged killer.
It is up to me and my homis
to help the Boston Police Department.
The police don't care...
Thank goodness the homies are on the case.
Rizzoli, why the hell is your informant
the lead choirboy for your mother's homies?
The police do care. They just can't be everywhere.
So Angela's guardians are gonna be there.
Well, it's gonna be Angela's ashes when I'm through.
Look at this.
Your mom is blogging about our case.
Uh-oh.
Double uh-oh.
Damn. 12,104 followers.
Yeah, you better hide.
You think he's gonna fire her?
Oh, I don't know. She really did it this time.
Well, we got a situation.
"Angela's guardians are gonna be there."
Yeah, and I'm gonna be back in evidence management.
Ooh. I don't think so.
How did she do that?
One study found that when sniffing pumpkin pie
and lavender, men become sexually aroused.
Maura!
Not one word, Rizzoli.
Hey, ma. Chatting with one of your virtual friends?
Did you see my blog?
I'm putting up a few more safety tips.
I have 12 followers so far.
You have 12,000, ma.
I do?
Uh, 12,313.
12,314.
Okay.
Time to say goodbye to your 12,000 little friends.
We have to help her. She's so angry.
I have a very good idea.
Uh, no, no. Whatever it is you're thinking of doing, don't.
It is none of our business.
Shut my mother's blog down now.
You sure?
I never built a blog that had this kind of traffic.
Do it or you'll be directing traffic.
All right, everything is significant to a serial killer.
He is not randomly targeting
and randomly dropping his victims at those bus stops.
Yeah, but we checked everything.
If there was a body dropped at any of those bus stops
in the last 20 years, we'd know about it.
Korsak, we checked
for body drops near Egleston Square.
Yeah.
But we didn't check incident reports.
You got something?
Maybe -- 20 years ago, a woman disappeared
from a store near Egleston Square.
"Libby McMurphy was reported missing
"from her store, Libby's doll house and tea room,
on August 22, 1992, by her mother, Marion Tibbets."
Libby McMurphy.
Libby, I can forgive anything.
Please come home for me...for Jonathan.
Whatever you've done...
That's a hell of a memory you got there, Korsak.
Isn't that your friend, Artie, the transit cop?
Yeah, Artie McMurphy. His wife was named Libby.
Well, son was 5 when she disappeared.
He'd be 25 now.
Frost, can you run the kid,
Johathan McMurphy?
Already running him.
Uh, no criminal, no DMV.
Oh, wait. Here's something.
Tewksbury State Hospital.
Mental hospital. Poor kid.
Come home.
He's been there eight years.
Maybe what happened to our two victims
also happened to his mother.
We'd like to talk to you about your daughter.
Why weren't you interested in what I had to say 20 years ago?
I see you brought some photos.
Is that Libby and Jonathan?
Yes, that's Libby and Jonathan at her store,
Libby's doll house and tea room.
Jonathan loved it there.
Is that -- what do you call them?
A scrunchie, yeah.
Libby gave them out as party favors.
Those were happy days.
Mrs. Tibbets, we've asked you here --
My Libby didn't run off.
Not that I'd blame her, the way Artie treated her.
Artie was abusive?
He was nice as pie at first.
But then after they were married,
she started wearing long-sleeve shirts to the shop
to hide the bruises.
Made excuses for how clumsy she was.
My daughter never would have left Jonathan behind
with that monster.
I kept the shop going until he took Jonathan,
and he locked him up in that horrible place.
These are love letters my daughter sent to Artie.
I saved them.
Libby kissed the envelopes.
I thought you might want her DNA.
I watch a lot of crime shows.
Thank you, Mrs. Tibbets.
12 excessive-force complaints
all involving you using a nightstick.
Liked to use it at home, too, didn't you?
You're pissing in the wind, Korsak.
You got no weapon, no motive, no DNA.
We've got a bloody piece of white-ash wood
that I'll bet came from your nightstick.
You're a betting man, right, Artie?
Would you like to also bet
that blood came from your missing wife?
Well, if you got that on me,
I'd be in cuffs instead of listening to your bullshit.
You gonna arrest me?
That's what I thought.
Don't hover. DNA processing takes time.
Well, we don't have time.
Faster, Maura. I need something.
You're breathing on me.
I don't believe this.
If that is a text
from a vacation club in Acapulco, don't respond.
It might be a scam.
Does this look like a scam?
It's from Casey.
He says he wants to meet for drinks tonight at the Dirty Robber.
The comparison test results for the two victims' lipsticks
and the lipstick on that envelope.
Thank you.
Jane, I might have something.
Libby McMurphy used the same brand of lipstick
as our two victims.
I think we just tied Artie to all three murders.
Come on. I need you.
I think I know who that 20-year-old blood belongs to.
Nothing?
Did you find Artie McMurphy?
No, his sergeant said he called in sick.
No sign of his car or him.
Barney Miller could have found something.
Yeah, frost?
Okay, thanks.
Another young woman got on a bus today.
She didn't make it home.
God. What can we do?
Artie's been a cop for a long time.
He knows we're looking for him.
He needs a safe place for his kill.
Yeah, but we've torn this house apart.
Wait a minute.
He left his last victim in Egleston Square.
His wife's shop was in Egleston Square.
A lot of those old storefronts
have been vacant for a long time.
What better place to make your own doll, right?
Come on.
Will you tell?!
No, I said I won't.
I'll kill you.
Please don't!
I swear I will.
Please don't!
Will you tell?
It's not Artie. It's Jonathan.
I won't.
Jonathan.
Jonathan.
Put the gun down, Artie.
Jonathan, let her go.
Doctors should have listened to me.
Giving him day passes,
trying to integrate him back into society.
That bus pass they gave him got two girls killed!
He's a monster.
Mommy, tell. You have to tell.
No! God!
I had to stop him. I had to do it.
Send E.M.S. in here now!
Hey, Jonathan, just stay with me, okay?
What did -- what did he do to your mom?
He hurt her.
Where's your mom now?
He said she went on the bus.
Is -- is that why you've been riding the bus?
I just wanted to find her.
And then I did.
Why didn't she tell?
I just wanted her to tell what he did to her.
It's over. Jonathan, it's -- I'll tell.
I'll tell.
Korsak.
The fireplace.
Cadaver dog didn't find anything.
You knew we were coming to search your house.
Come on, Artie, we're taking you home.
Move.
He started a fire.
To throw off the dog.
Do it.
You can't do that.
You killed his mother in front of him.
You turned your son into a monster.
I, uh...I'm really glad you wanted to meet me.
Me too.
So...
So...
You want to get a drink?
Yes. Yes.
And...
I just -- I just want to...start over.
Me too.
Start...slow.
Okay.
You know, like, maybe we'd meet once a week
for a run, you know?
A run?
Yeah.
Hell, I'll even take up rollerblading again.
Payback is a bitch.
What?
You were humiliated
when I said I didn't want to see you. I get it.
Is it making you feel better to make me come here
and torture me?
You want to ski, too?
What are you talking about?
I knew I was a fool when I got your note.
I was so happy.
Wait. What note? I didn't write you a note.
Yeah?
This is my mother's handwriting.
Yeah.
Maybe now you'll understand
why I didn't want to see you.
Penetrating spinal-cord injury.
Just takes a dime-sized piece of shrapnel
hitting you in the right place.
You happy now?
Casey, I had no idea.
Now you do.
Wait a minute. Wait. I-I didn't write this.
But if you would have told me,
I would have said the same thing.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
Rollerblading? Really?
Yeah, well, I do want to see you, though.
Okay.
I really do.
Just give me some time, okay?
Okay.
Jane?
Please don't watch me leave.
Okay.
I knew you weren't mean.
How did it go?
I asked him to go rollerblading.
Shut the front door. You did not.
Oh, yeah, I did.
Oh, my god.
I think I might have also suggested running.
Your mother is a dead woman.
Is a dead woman.
