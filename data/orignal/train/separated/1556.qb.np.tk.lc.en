my foster father caught my little brother
wearing one of his ex @-@ wife &apos;s dresses .
started beating the crap out of him .
foster siblings are not allowed to ...
hook up ?
there &apos;s nothing going on between callie and i.
you look nice .
what do you want from me ?
stimulating conversation ... and sex .
you could have any girl you wanted .
why &apos;d it have to be my best friend ?
you read her journal ?
yes . just listen to me ...
i can &apos;t do this anymore ! i &apos;m done .
please .
she told you .
she didn &apos;t tell me what it said .
i already know everything i need to know about you .
callie , wait .
oh , my god .
what ?
演唱者 toby lightman
i meant to pick up some guacamole from that place you love .
oh , that stuff &apos;s so good , too .
sorry , mariana called me ,
then jude needed me , and i just ... forgot .
remember when you used to love me ?
don &apos;t do that . i feel terrible .
let me guess , just salsa will be fine ...
hey , where do you think you &apos;re going , young man ?
can &apos;t we just go up and play video games ?
no , no . you know the rules .
no girls allowed in your bedroom unless one of us is upstairs .
so , we &apos;re just supposed to stay here ,
hang out with your lame old friends all night ?
sandra just spent 20 minutes telling us
how she installed her own toilet . that &apos;s not fair .
no , what &apos;s not fair is when i make you start cleaning up
all the dirty plates around the house ,
because you just called our friends lame and old .
knock yourself out .
taking out the trash ?
hey , enough . go , go , go .
lexi , you can help .
why does she have to be here ?
she is your brother &apos;s girlfriend .
look , i know that this has got to be hard for you right now ,
but she &apos;s your best friend .
not anymore .
just like families , sometimes friends fight .
and lie to your face ?
and they still love you no matter what .
yeah , well ... if that &apos;s love , i don &apos;t want it .
mariana !
oh , my god , garret !
mariana , you look beautiful .
where are your mothers ?
kitchen .
wow , you look ... different .
puberty . turns out the rumor &apos;s true .
it really does change things .
that &apos;s what happens when we don &apos;t see each other for a year .
what &apos;s happening with you ? tell me everything .
max detail . go .
thank you for bringing the casserole .
vegetarian ?
vegan .
we can barely get food on the table three times a day .
i don &apos;t know how you guys find time to be so healthy .
i don &apos;t do it . all credit to the chef in the family .
where &apos;s stef ?
she &apos;s out back , womaning the grill .
that &apos;s the nicest thing
she &apos;s said to me in i don &apos;t know how long .
we &apos;re going through a rough patch .
we all go through those .
yeah , did they usually last two years ?
is everything ok ?
演唱者 meiko
we &apos;re talking about splitting up .
what ?
no , that &apos;s impossible .
you can &apos;t do that , you &apos;re kelly and jenna .
i know .
after 20 years ,
you start thinking it &apos;s really forever ,
that nothing can pull you apart .
so , what changed ?
i don &apos;t know .
we did , i guess .
you know how it is ,
you &apos;re so focused on kids , work , and paying the bills ,
that you stop paying attention to each other .
all the things you used to do for each other , the little stuff ...
one day , you start forgetting to do those things ,
and you think , &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;
then the next day ,
you stop caring that you forgot in the first place .
and before long ,
you realize all you have in common is the routine .
and since i &apos;ve been obsessed with ferlinghetti for a year ,
美国 &quot; 垮掉的一代 &quot; 的代表人物
i decided to try poetry .
so , i &apos;m writing a piece for a poetry slam this week .
what &apos;s a poetry slam ?
it &apos;s sort of like a concert , but with poems instead of songs .
think hip @-@ hop meets the beat poets .
you know , ginsberg and kerouac .
美国 &quot; 垮掉的一代 &quot; 的代表人物
oh , yeah , i totally love them .
the art house in hillcrest is playing on the road .
from the novel . you know , by kerouac .
oh , right .
you want to check it out with me ?
ok .
having fun ?
it &apos;s kind of a weird party .
yeah , my moms have a lot of weird friends .
i mean , everybody &apos;s nice .
hey .
hey , what &apos;s he doing here ?
i invited him .
wow , this is quite the rager .
lighten up , dude . i &apos;m kidding .
yeah , i know . just don &apos;t call me dude .
did you get enough to eat , jude ?
yeah .
ok , see this is a dry dish .
and this is me not caring .
watch your mouth , young man .
what ? if you like how he does it so much better ,
he can come over every night and do it .
so , jenna told me that garret is doing some poetry slam .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
i was thinking , maybe we could all go
if he makes it to performance round .
it &apos;d be a nice break from volleyball and television ...
might even learn something .
i &apos;m in .
ooh , learning . cool .
wow .
i &apos;ll go .
not your thing ?
no , no , just ...
yeah , it &apos;s not my thing .
well , it &apos;s your choice , but we &apos;d love to have you join us .
if it &apos;s ok , i think i &apos;m just going to pass .
ok , manual labor &apos;s done .
i got to get home . thank you , guys , for a fun night .
thank you for helping us .
very nice to meet you , wyatt .
pleasure .
ok .
yeah , nice to meet you , wyatt .
you , too , big guy . see you .
all right .
goodnight .
goodnight .
hey , what are you doing with that guy ?
that guy is the only person i &apos;ve met at school
who isn &apos;t completely freaked out by me .
just be careful with him .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
he used to date talya .
so ?
it &apos;s not that . i mean ...
ok , he was really into her for awhile ,
then he convinced her to have sex with him .
yeah ?
and then he dumped her.the next day .
just trust me , he &apos;s not a good guy .
isn &apos;t it jesus &apos;s week to help with laundry ?
yeah , i told him not to bother .
the last time he did it my white linen pants
came out of the dryer as pink capris .
so , jenna told me that she and kelly may be splitting up .
what ? no way . what ? you &apos;re kidding .
i know . jenna said
they haven &apos;t had sex in over a year .
oh , dear .
that is a long time to let it go , isn &apos;t it .
how long has it been for us ?
uh , it was last ...
if you have to think about it , it &apos;s been too long .
sweetheart , what do you expect ?
we have jobs , five kids ,
and no cleaning person .
can &apos;t expect things to be the way they used to be .
they shouldn &apos;t be this different .
let &apos;s have a date night . you know , like we used to .
with cocktails , and dinner , and then other stuff ...
mm @-@ hm . you think we have time for all that ?
how about just the &quot; other stuff &quot; part ?
i can handle that . let me check my phone .
let &apos;s see .
tomorrow &apos;s not great .
why ?
jude has his tutor and you have to take
brandon to his dentist appointment .
no , i thought you were taking brandon .
no , i can &apos;t . i have to talk to the tutor about jude &apos;s mid @-@ terms .
ok , how about this ? how about ...
you leave work early ,
i will take a late lunch . the house will be empty .
and there will be no kids to worry about .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
do we have any more those antacids ?
your chimichangas are killing me ...
what time are your parents coming home ?
not for hours .
are you ok ?
i &apos;m great , i just ...
just need a little break .
we don &apos;t have to stop .
really ?
演唱者 clare bowditch
i like that color .
are you sure it &apos;s not too much ?
i &apos;m going for the &quot; i &apos;m being carelessly casual but just happen
to be fabulous &quot; look for my date tonight .
it &apos;s pretty .
do you want me to do yours ?
come on , let me do yours .
ok .
so , anything new and exciting in your world ?
made any new friends ?
well , there is this one boy .
oh ?
his name is connor ,
and we have math class together .
what &apos;s he like ?
i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s pretty cool .
uh , don &apos;t wear that to school . ok , buddy ?
you don &apos;t have to do everything she says , you know ...
演唱者 jack dolgen
what happened with you and talya ?
my night was great .
and yes , this is a new shirt . thanks for noticing .
it does bring out my eyes .
everything &apos;s not a joke .
ok , wow , you &apos;re going for this direct thing .
this is brandon , right ? he told you this ?
talya and i ,
we hung out , she seemed chill ,
i liked her , and we had sex .
and that &apos;s supposed to make you , what ...
exactly ? feel like a real man ?
you wanted to know what happened .
i &apos;m just giving you the full story .
as soon as we did it , she changed .
she got all weird and controlling .
in case you haven &apos;t noticed , that &apos;s not really my thing .
so , after a couple weeks ,
i let her know i wasn &apos;t into it anymore .
so , you didn &apos;t break up with her the next day ?
i did not . everyone thinks she &apos;s one of those nice girls .
she &apos;s actually kind of crazy .
ah ... sorry .
apology not accepted .
what ?
if you think you can just attack me ...
wasn &apos;t an attack .
... and say you &apos;re sorry and it &apos;s all better ?
mm @-@ mm . i &apos;m not some pushover
who takes a hit and comes back for more .
you &apos;re going to have to make it up to me .
tomorrow night .
and do what ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
well , i &apos;ll have to ask lena and stef .
they &apos;ll say yes .
you &apos;re confident .
well , i didn &apos;t stick around and dry dishes
just because i like cleaning up after other people .
see you tomorrow .
it was not .
i swear , it was a 55 @-@ pound white seabass .
my dad weighed it . it was crazy big .
you fish ?
i &apos;ve never even been on a boat .
how do you grow up by the beach but never get on a boat ?
you have to come next time my dad takes me out .
really ?
wait , i forgot my book .
nice nails . you wearing a bra , too ?
why don &apos;t you guys just grow up ?
what &apos;d you just say ?
i said grow up , idiot .
who &apos;re you calling an idiot ?
what &apos;s going on here ?
blake , jeremy . principal &apos;s office . now .
hey . brought you something .
they had the good ones in the cafeteria today .
i know you like them , so ...
thanks .
are you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
you sure ?
what if i get pregnant ?
that &apos;s not going to happen .
you don &apos;t know that .
my parents ...
my parents would kill me .
yes , i need a morning @-@ after pill , please .
thanks .
hi . i &apos;m picking up for my son , jesus foster .
and this , please .
hey ! what is going on ?
lena ?
upstairs !
uh , i am here with jesus .
could you come down for a minute , please ?
why is mom home so early ?
you are not in a position to be asking questions , young man .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
last night , i ...
last night , lexi and i had sex .
oh , my god .
ok ... and ?
and we didn &apos;t use protection .
how many times have we talked about this ?
i know , but it ... just sort of happened .
and then it was too late .
well , we needed the morning @-@ after pill ,
but i guess you have to have id to buy it .
neither of us have id , so ...
i asked some lady at the pharmacy to get the pill for us .
and that &apos;s when mom found me .
jesus , how many ways do we have to tell you to come to us ?
why didn &apos;t you come to us ?
to avoid this .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
so , can i give it to her ?
your mom and i need to talk about this . please go to your room .
i know it was stupid ,
but lexi thought it was the only thing to do .
why ?
she &apos;s afraid her parents are going to find out and freak .
we did everything we were supposed to do ...
open dialogue , no stigmatizing ,
no fear based warnings .
we even put condoms in their bathroom .
we can &apos;t blame ourselves , honey .
i know , i know . i &apos;m just ...
really disappointed .
i know .
so , now what ?
we give her the pill .
what about her parents ?
what about her parents .
if this were mariana , we would want to know .
we can &apos;t go making decisions for other people &apos;s kids .
ok , what if she gets pregnant , lena ?
you know how religious her parents are .
they &apos;re certainly not going to let her terminate .
they &apos;re going to want them to get married .
do you want jesus to be married and a father at 15 ?
please quit reminding me that they &apos;re 15 .
well , they are .
there &apos;s always adoption .
i ... do you really want them to go through that ?
&apos;cause i got to tell you i don &apos;t ...
i have a responsibility here .
i understand .
i am her vice principal .
and i am not .
can we just take a beat , please ?
this is not the kind of thing we act on
without thinking it through first .
i &apos;m going to go get dressed .
you didn &apos;t like it , did you ?
of course , i liked it .
on the road is like a classic .
it &apos;s just ... i don &apos;t know ,
i feel like everyone was kind of selfish ,
and just angry and didn &apos;t care about anyone else .
they had a lot to be angry about .
they were looking for answers and
no one else was even asking the questions .
ok , i guess i didn &apos;t like it .
maybe next time we can go see the lone ranger .
so , you want to come in ? we can ,
i don &apos;t know , watch tv or something .
tv &apos;s not really my thing .
besides , i got to meet up with a friend .
i promised i &apos;d help her rehearse a poem
for the first round of the slam tomorrow .
the second round &apos;s supposed to be a big to @-@ do .
but , thanks for a fun time .
yeah , sure .
see you later .
no , i &apos;m serious .
it &apos;s like he didn &apos;t even know it was a date .
maybe he didn &apos;t . why do you care anyway ?
well , we &apos;re not all as lucky as you .
you just got here , you don &apos;t even try ,
and you already have a boyfriend .
wyatt , not a boyfriend .
he sure seems like a boyfriend .
look , if garret wants to hang out
with some alternative poetry girls , let him .
besides , do you really want to date a guy
whose pants are tighter than yours ?
they were kind of tight , huh ?
how &apos;re you holding up ?
i &apos;m fine .
do you want to talk about anything ?
what &apos;s going on ?
jude just had a rough day yesterday .
some of the kids were giving him a hard time .
what happened ? are you ok ?
he &apos;s fine . but , a couple of the guys noticed his nail polish ...
i told you not to go to school with it on , jude .
go take it off . now .
stop telling me what to do .
callie , jude &apos;s a special kid .
i appreciate what you &apos;re trying to do , lena .
but what makes him special , gets him beat up .
well , he &apos;s safe in this house .
and thank you for that , really .
but we &apos;re not staying here .
i don &apos;t want him to start thinking the world is like this ,
and then we move , and then he gets even more hurt
when he figures out that it &apos;s not .
hey . hello .
hey , wyatt .
oh , wait , before you go .
it &apos;s an old one of stef &apos;s . we want you to have it .
you &apos;re on the family plan now .
thanks .
so , 10 o &apos;clock , and not a second later .
got it ?
got it .
oh , i &apos;m glad to hear that , but i wasn &apos;t talking to you .
ten o &apos;clock .
yeah .
where &apos;s she going ?
on a date with wyatt .
what about you ? any plans ?
um ... no .
演唱者 jesse thomas
so , when do i get to know what we &apos;re actually doing here ?
wait and see .
come on .
you have a beach house ?
my parents do . pretty much never use it .
ok , what are we doing here ?
you hear about that meteor shower tonight ?
what about it ?
front row seats . come on .
the sun &apos;s about to set .
may i ?
you know , just a little dab will do the trick .
do you mind ?
ok .
when stef and i are at home ,
we hold hands and kiss ...
really ?
well , we used to do it a lot more often ,
but we &apos;ve just been really busy lately .
what does being busy have to do with holding hands ?
ok , we &apos;re getting a little off @-@ track here .
my point is ,
sometimes when we &apos;re out in a new neighborhood
or walking home late to our car , we won &apos;t hold hands .
why ?
some people out there
are afraid of what &apos;s different .
and sometimes they want to hurt people like stef and me .
so , every time we &apos;re out and i want to hold stef &apos;s hand ,
but i decide not to ?
i get mad .
and mad at the people who might want to hurt us ,
but mad at myself , too , for not standing up to them .
cause the thing is ,
if you &apos;re taught to hide what makes you different ,
you can end up feeling a lot of shame about who you are .
and that &apos;s not ok .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with you for wearing nail polish ,
just like there &apos;s nothing wrong with me for holding stef &apos;s hand .
what &apos;s wrong is the people out there who make us feel unsafe .
it &apos;s beautiful .
you mean that dense layer of clouds
that &apos;s keeping us from seeing anything
or the loud plane that keeps flying over ?
well , you tried .
i tried .
valiant effort .
you have an eye booger .
oh , my god ... seriously ?
no , i &apos;m just making it up to make you feel good about yourself .
other side .
all right ...
it &apos;s still there , you just moved it .
ok .
i &apos;ll get it .
i thought you said your parents never use the house .
yeah , this isn &apos;t my house . we got to go .
what the hell was that ?
i did a construction job at that house last summer .
i really thought they only used the place on weekends .
are you freakin &apos; kidding me ?
i &apos;m on probation ! you understand what could have happened
if they caught us ?
i &apos;m sorry ...
i was just trying to impress you .
well , congratulations .
i &apos;m blown away by your
utter lack of regard for anyone but yourself .
i have to be home in a half hour .
good luck getting through the police barricade to get to my car .
it &apos;s too soon ?
and wisps of dirty hair cling to your angry face .
there is a tiny bit of
mustard burrowed in the crack of your frown .
and this is when i know
and this is when it changes .
and this is the way i will remember you .
you seriously did great .
like , andrea gibson great .
i couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
演唱者 donovan woods
hey , what are you doing here ?
um , i &apos;m performing . you kind of inspired me .
oh , ok . that &apos;s great .
i &apos;m sorry . mariana , this is savannah .
savannah , this is mariana .
she &apos;s a friend of my family .
i like your outfit , and your poem was really cool .
oh . thanks .
mom .
i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re not here for a little mother @-@ son time ?
did you guys decide about the pill yet ?
we &apos;re still thinking about it , jesus .
ok , but , lexi &apos;s kind of freaking out , because ...
well , it &apos;s called the morning @-@ after pill for a reason , you know ?
yes . i know .
this is one of those things we &apos;ll laugh about tomorrow .
it &apos;s unlikely .
thanks for coming .
sure .
thanks for bailing us out , bro .
i &apos;m not your bro .
blooming like a rose in spring .
blossoming like an easter lily .
your smile is a flower on the garden of your face .
that was really nice .
thanks .
all right .
thank you so very much for coming .
we &apos;re impressed . so , for tomorrow &apos;s round @-@ two performance ,
we &apos;d like to use ...
matt devry , alice lewis ,
gabriella dupont ,
savannah george , and mo peters ...
and closing the night out will be garret paul .
let &apos;s give all the performers a hand .
thanks for coming out .
sorry .
it &apos;s cool .
演唱者 toby lightman
closing the show , huh ? nice .
excuse me . hi ...
i was just wondering if you could tell me why i didn &apos;t make it ?
you know , so i can be better prepared for next time .
this is your first performance , right ?
you did an amazing job , really .
we &apos;re just looking for something different .
a little more raw , you know ? but you &apos;ll get there .
hey , i said i was sorry .
and i said it was ok .
why are you acting so mad ?
you really have to ask ?
you just had me pick you up on a date with wyatt !
why do you hate wyatt so much ?
this isn &apos;t even about wyatt .
ok ?
i don &apos;t want you dating wyatt
because i don &apos;t want you dating anyone .
i can &apos;t ...
i can &apos;t do this .
well , too bad .
even having this conversation could
get me and jude kicked out of the house .
that would never happen .
you don &apos;t know that .
two years ago , jude and i were in a really good foster home .
definitely the best before coming here .
and they had a son .
and he was really nice to me . so , we started hanging out .
and then the parents found out .
and he told them it was my fault ,
i was coming on to him .
and the next day ,
the next day , they had me and jude sent away .
and the parents told cps some excuse .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that their son was having
a relationship with the trashy foster girl .
so , yeah , brandon . it can happen ...
because it already did .
i &apos;m not like him . i would never do that .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it still ends the same way .
admit it , you want me to apologize .
i don &apos;t , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
no , you want me to apologize
so you can forgive me .
and everything can go back to normal
because you like me .
so i like you
because you &apos;re reckless and presumptuous ?
that &apos;s interesting .
you &apos;re not as good of a liar as you think you are .
look , i &apos;ve done a lot of stupid things in my life ,
i haven &apos;t regretted any of it , until last night .
i should not have done what i did .
i regret it . and i &apos;m sorry .
so , how long are you going to leave me hanging here ?
we good ?
come on , it &apos;s not like i &apos;m asking you to marry me .
just give me another chance ,
all right ?
you ok ?
these lips take a while to process , i know .
i &apos;m fine .
演唱者 the weepies
are you sure you &apos;re ok ?
i &apos;m not feeling great , but i &apos;m ok . yeah .
but , this ... all of this is too much .
i think we need to ...
well , stop doing what we did . at least for a little while .
and if that means you don &apos;t like me ...
hey , hey .
i like you . i &apos;m not going anywhere , ok ?
演唱者 maggie eckford
want half ? their peanut butter is all weird and oily
but it &apos;s still pretty good if you add sugar .
why are you still wearing that ?
because i like it .
well , take it off before you get a black eye to match .
no .
what ?
i &apos;m not taking it off .
you want to get beat up again ?
yeah , that &apos;s exactly what i want .
look , i know it &apos;s easy to feel comfortable here ,
but this isn &apos;t our home .
you shouldn &apos;t get too invested in these people .
why not ? don &apos;t you want a family ?
i have a family .
it &apos;s not ...
i like them . they &apos;re nice .
and maybe it &apos;s not forever , but so what ?
you &apos;re going to get hurt .
i already hurt .
sorry to bother you . do you have a minute ?
of course . come on in .
have a seat .
what &apos;s up ?
i just wanted to tell you that i &apos;m sorry if i disappointed you .
you and stef have been a second family to me .
have you thought any more about talking to your mom ?
oh . no , i can &apos;t . she &apos;d lose it .
i mean , if she ever found out that you guys gave me the pill ,
she &apos;d go crazy .
my mom can get so mad .
your mom &apos;s not the only one .
ok ...
i just wanted to say thank you .
you &apos;ll tell stef for me ?
oh , i definitely will .
were you going to tell me ?
i was , when you got home . can we please talk in here .
well , instead i had to learn from a 15 year old girl
that my partner went behind my back .
i &apos;m sorry , but i knew you felt a responsibility
to lexi &apos;s parents because you &apos;re her vice principal .
i did it so you did not have to .
how generous .
that &apos;s not productive .
we make decisions about our children together .
yes , absolutely we do .
but waiting to make a decision
could have made our son a father at 15 .
i knew you were in an awkward position . i was very careful .
i talked her through everything ,
and i made sure she knew this was a last resort .
tell me you &apos;re not relieved , lena .
hey , we &apos;ve been waiting for you . we got to go ...
we &apos;re gonna be late . everybody please come downstairs .
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go !
where &apos;s mariana ?
probably sticking pins in a voodoo doll of lexi .
hey , cool it . you owe us .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , cool it ...
who you telling to cool it ?
will you go get her , please ?
why do i have to go ?
because you &apos;re our favorite .
hey ... is it too late for me to tag along ?
no , of course not . we &apos;d love it .
mariana , you in there ?
mariana ?
moms are going to kill you .
nice of you to join us , miss thing .
what happened to your face ?
do you like it ?
no , i don &apos;t like it .
did it hurt ?
sort of .
of course it hurt . you punched a hole in your face .
ok , enough . we &apos;ll deal with you later .
let &apos;s go . everybody in the car .
what is happening ?
what &apos;s happening ?
last tuesday night ,
my mother jenna comes into the house
i &apos;m sitting in the living room with my other mom , kelly .
jenna asks us if we &apos;ll take a drive with her ,
so we all get in the car .
and as we drive ,
silence creeps along like the cracks in a frozen lake .
our hearts begin to thud slowly ,
off beat .
and i wonder and then i know .
and i didn &apos;t imagine it would end like this .
i didn &apos;t imagine an ending at all ,
but if they were going to tell me about the divorce ,
what a way to do it .
i sit in the backseat and think about
how lucky we were to have had this family .
their 20 years of marriage , my 15 with them .
i remember all of us , driving for miles out on the highway
until i fell asleep in the backseat .
i don &apos;t want this life to end , jenna starts to talk .
she tells me that our car
is just 13 miles away from reaching 100,000 miles now .
i wonder if this is part of the divorce speech
or just a distraction .
i feel angry , they should just say it .
she tells me the reason we took this ride
is so that we could all be there to reach 100,000 miles together ,
as the people who matter in her life .
slowly , i realize that this isn &apos;t a breakup ride
or a divorce ride , or a separation ride .
this is a 100,000 mile ride .
we &apos;re in the car , and we &apos;re driving on a tuesday night ,
and we &apos;re 99,987 miles in .
we stop for onion rings and sundaes , keep driving .
99,993 miles , stevie nicks .
美国著名摇滚女歌手
99,997 miles , elton john .
英国著名流行音乐创作歌手
when we get to 99,999 miles ,
we hold hands ,
blast melissa etheridge , and sing lucky at the top of our lungs .
美国著名女歌手 《 幸运 》 是其代表作
there are too many reasons
that my mamas found love in each other &apos;s presence .
there are too many moments when we are unbreakable ,
and in this moment , we are one family .
constructing road as we go , burning bridges behind us ,
adding mileage like graceful aging .
driving in our car towards moonlight .
all right , garret ! woo !
