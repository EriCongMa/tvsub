第七季 第十六集
i &apos;m thinking about growing a goatee .
oh , actually that &apos;s a van dyke .
a goatee is just hair on the chin .
oh . wait , then what is it if you just have hair up here ?
you mean a moustache ?
moo @-@ stache !
he said it !
ha @-@ ha , very funny . make fun of the foreign guy .
for your information , there are four times as many
indians as there are americans , so the way we say it is right .
say what ?
moo @-@ stache .
moo @-@ stache !
he said &quot; moo @-@ stache &quot;
guys , you &apos;re being childish .
yeah , she &apos;s right . you &apos;re grown men ,
the kind who are perfectly capable
of growing your own moo @-@ staches .
hey , you were funny on purpose , good job .
hi . sorry i &apos;m late-- i was at an audition .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;ll get &apos; em next time .
how about instead of assuming i failed ,
you ask me how it went ?
sorry .
how did it go ?
just shut up .
here , you can have your seat .
no , no , no , stay there . i &apos;m fine on the floor .
have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table ?
yeah . you actually do have room for one up there .
oh , sure , i sit on the floor for years , no one cares .
the pretty white girl &apos;s there ten seconds ,
and suddenly we &apos;re all running to ikea .
no one is running anywhere .
we &apos;re not getting a dining room table .
i know you don &apos;t like change ,
but it &apos;s not a terrible idea .
yeah , you guys never use that space up there .
why not get a table ?
do you want the long answer or the short answer ?
hey , how come we never get that option ?
chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system ,
if the equations describing its behavior are nonlinear ,
a tiny change in the initial conditions
can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result .
translation ?
waah . i don &apos;t want a table !
hey , penny and i are gonna go shop for a dining room table .
you want to come with us ?
you know , i &apos;d love to ,
but , um , i &apos;m too busy
falling back in love with windows 98 .
seriously ? you haven &apos;t used this desk in years .
the second i want to get rid of it , you &apos;re up here working ?
i can &apos;t talk right now--
i have several thousand updates to install .
are you really gonna sit here all day ?
think of me as arthur dent in hitchhiker &apos;s guide to the galaxy ,
lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home .
if you &apos;ll recall , the vogon fleet blew up the earth anyway .
it &apos;s a made @-@ up story , leonard--
i don &apos;t even know why you &apos;re talking about it .
i &apos;m putting all this stuff in storage .
we don &apos;t need any of it .
you ... how can you say that ?
you show me one thing in here we can live without .
oh , hang on .
check your in @-@ box .
wait . is this really worth it ?
we &apos;ve lived together for years
with nary an argument . huh ?
but we start talking about a table ,
and suddenly we &apos;re at each other &apos;s throats .
&quot; nary an argument &quot; ?
&quot; nary &quot; ? !
well , that means &quot; not one , &quot; or &quot; not any &quot; &quot;
maybe instead of a table , you should buy a dictionary .
well , i don &apos;t know if i won that ,
but at least he &apos;s upset .
check it out .
magic wand tv remote !
yeah , i can control all sorts of stuff .
did bernadette think it was cool ?
not when i said &quot; mute &quot; and pointed it at her face .
oh , uh , let me try .
channelis changeroni !
this might be my second favorite brown magic wand .
well , that &apos;s the last time i play with that .
i have to take this .
hello ?
off .
and on .
and the oprah network .
this is so much better than watching tv like a muggle .
okay . thank you .
we &apos;ll be in touch .
you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh . wait .
on !
and off !
what &apos;s going on ?
that was nasa .
they want me to go back up to the space station .
wow . what did you tell them ?
i told them i &apos;d be honored .
a second trip to space-- i &apos;ll miss you .
and i &apos;m gonna miss you , too .
i just want you to know , i &apos;m happy
to look in on bernadette while you &apos;re gone .
thank you .
and if anything were to happen to you ,
we will name our firstborn son howard .
i &apos;m just kidding .
we &apos;ll name him dalib , after my grandfather .
ooh , this one looks nice .
no . sheldon doesn &apos;t like reclaimed wood .
why not ?
he &apos;s afraid the original owners will come back .
yeah . well , sheldon &apos;s not here .
well , he is here .
so unless you want to dig him out
with a bone saw and a melon baller ,
there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
all right , sweetie , you &apos;re paying for this table ,
and it &apos;s your apartment , too .
i know , but ...
no buts .
you got to stop letting him boss you around .
you &apos;re right . i mean , h @-@ he decides what tv shows we watch ,
what food we eat , who my favorite hobbit is--
i wanted frodo , but we can &apos;t both have frodo ,
so guess who &apos;s stuck with samwise gamgee .
see ? right there . you &apos;re a grown man ,
you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want .
wish you wouldn &apos;t , but one problem at a time .
y @-@ you make a lot of sense .
i like this table , and i &apos;m getting it .
really ? this one ?
that one ?
damn right i like that one .
good news .
someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket .
fine . can i at least shower first ?
no , not that .
although you already agreed to it , so no take @-@ backs .
what are you talking about ?
sit down .
nasa called .
the telescope mount i installed
on the space station got damaged ,
and they want me to go back up and fix it .
well , what did you say ?
what do you think i ... ? i said yes !
why do you look surprised ?
well , it &apos;s just , after last time ,
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d ever want to go back .
are you kidding ?
it was the greatest experience of my life .
really ?
&apos;cause i kind of remember a lot of complaining
and wishing for it to be over .
i think you have me confused with
what &apos;s gonna happen when you get out of that shower .
hey , all set . what do you think ?
there &apos;s plenty of room for everybody ,
a view out the window .
my spot on the couch has a great view of a window .
sometimes i can see space battles through it .
it &apos;s called a tv .
give it a chance , sheldon ; you might actually like it .
you &apos;re absolutely right .
nope .
well , you can &apos;t say he didn &apos;t give it a fair shot .
so , when can we get rid of it ?
we &apos;re not .
what about the roommate agreement ?
it specifically states
that any changes in furnishing
have to be approved by the furnishing committee .
which only sits on alternate years .
yeah , and by the way ,
it sits over there .
come on , that is ridiculous .
she &apos;s right--
a committee that important should meet more often .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying .
this is the thing about me standing up to him
and not letting him run my life ?
yes .
that .
okay . i think we &apos;ve found the problem here .
it &apos;s not the table at all .
it &apos;s you .
me ?
well , it &apos;s always me-- take one for the team .
i have spent years turning this lump of clay
into an acceptable conduit for my will ,
and then you came along and reshaped him ,
with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals .
are you gonna let him talk to me like this ?
&quot; fancy &quot; sounds like a compliment .
okay , i have not tried to change leonard .
that &apos;s just what happens in relationships .
look how much amy &apos;s changed you .
that &apos;s not true .
oh , please .
when i first met you , you were incapable
of touching another human being .
now you &apos;re holding hands , you &apos;re going on dates ,
you even made out with her on a train .
she told you ? !
of course she told me-- it &apos;s the most interesting thing
that &apos;s ever happened to her in her entire life !
you &apos;re too close to it ,
but amy has had a huge impact on you .
you &apos;re right .
without realizing it , i &apos;ve allowed that woman
to alter my personality .
mm , sheldon , you didn &apos;t have a personality ;
you just had some shows you liked .
no .
no , i &apos;ve changed .
like the frog who &apos;s put in a pot of water
that &apos;s heated so gradually
he doesn &apos;t realize he &apos;s boiling to death .
or you &apos;re the frog who &apos;s been kissed by a princess
and turned into a prince .
or you &apos;re just a tall , annoying frog .
excuse me .
i have to break up with my girlfriend .
oh , sheldon , wait .
no .
you &apos;ve opened my eyes to the truth .
amy has made me a more affectionate ,
open @-@ minded person .
and that stops now .
well , we should call her .
yeah , mm @-@ hmm .
amy , it &apos;s penny . hey .
just a little heads @-@ up .
leonard bought a dining room table .
yeah . sheldon &apos;s breaking up with you .
amy ? amy ?
amy ?
i &apos;ll get right to the point .
i think we need to end this relationship-- so ...
just sign this with your finger , and , uh ,
please don &apos;t cry on my ipad--
i didn &apos;t get applecare .
i &apos;m not surprised you want to end the relationship .
i &apos;m a little surprised you didn &apos;t get applecare .
anyway , enjoy your life . where do i sign ?
at the bottom . i must say ,
i &apos;m relieved you &apos;re not making more of a scene out of this .
oh , i &apos;ve already moved on .
besides , this breakup has nothing to do with me .
wh ... it doesn &apos;t ?
of course not .
this is just leonard trying to take the focus off
that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship .
he &apos;s manipulating you like he always does .
wait @-@ wait , now , hang on .
you think he manipulates me ?
all the time .
and he knew that ,
as your girlfriend , i wasn &apos;t gonna stand by
and let him bring a table into your apartment .
i mean , a table ? come on !
it is hideous .
well , thankfully , i won &apos;t have to see it ,
&apos;cause i won &apos;t be your girlfriend anymore .
amy farrah fowler .
why , yes , i would like to take a survey .
wait .
you were really gonna stand by me
against the dining room table ?
of course i was .
yeah , wait .
how do i know that you &apos;re not manipulating me right now ?
i think if i were manipulating you ,
you &apos;d be smart enough to see it .
how do i know you &apos;re not saying that
as part of the manipulation ?
i think you &apos;d be smart enough to see that , too .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry i gave you such a hard time-- i just had to be sure .
it &apos;s pretty exciting that nasa
wants to send howard back up .
yeah , exciting .
can i ask you something ?
course .
he hated that entire experience .
does it make me an awful wife
if i don &apos;t think he should do it again ?
not at all .
he &apos;s forgotten how miserable he was
the entire time he was up there .
it &apos;s like me in those moments when i miss india .
so you &apos;ll talk to him ?
why me ?
well , i &apos;m his wife ; i don &apos;t want to ruin it for him .
that &apos;s the dynamic--
i &apos;m the fun one , you &apos;re the buzzkill .
since when am i the buzzkill ?
do you think this is cool ?
no , i think it &apos;s stupid .
you &apos;re right , it &apos;s great .
hello .
you guys didn &apos;t break up .
no . sorry to disappoint you ,
but amy pointed out that
you were only trying to manipulate me .
which you also figured out by yourself .
which i also figured out by myself .
well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re still together .
yeah , okay , you can stop trying
to make this about our relationship .
which is stronger than ever .
which is stronger than ever .
this is about you trying to change my environment ,
which was perfect the way it was .
but it got the way it was through change .
the @-@ the spot that you love to sit in ,
that no one else can sit in ,
only exists because--
despite your objections-- i bought this couch .
me .
so explain why that change was bad
and this change was good .
you don &apos;t need to explain yourself to him .
i don &apos;t need to explain myself to you !
you &apos;re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me .
keep the table ! we don &apos;t use that space !
damn it , i got cocky .
hey , bernie . i &apos;m home ... hello .
hi , honey .
what &apos;s going on ?
maybe you should have a seat .
um ... okay .
i know my mom &apos;s not dead ; there &apos;d be balloons .
first off ,
know that we all love you and cherish you .
well , i wouldn &apos;t ...
daddy .
you &apos;re great .
can i say something ?
oh , of course .
hey , fruit loops .
massimino ? why are you here ?
well , i heard you were thinking about
going back up to the space station ,
and as someone who &apos;s been there with you ...
well , you know how astronauts need to have the &quot; right stuff &quot; ?
sure .
the stuff you have is wrong .
you don &apos;t think i did a good job up there ?
you did a fine job .
it &apos;s just , you were scared and miserable the whole time .
i think what we &apos;re all trying to say is ,
you don &apos;t seem to be remembering
how traumatic the experience was for you .
l @-@ like how women often forget the pain of childbirth .
like a woman . great analogy .
fine , maybe i was a little scared .
you peed in your space suit .
you &apos;re supposed to do that .
not during the fitting .
son , do i need to remind you what you asked me to do
before you went up last time ?
hang on . that was just me joking around .
you wanted me to shoot you in the foot .
come on , how is that not a joke ?
&quot; you got to get me out of this . shoot me in the foot . &quot;
don &apos;t forget all the other astronauts picking on you .
and how you threw up in zero gravity ,
and it floated back in your mouth .
and you threw up again .
and so on and so on .
that was funny .
okay , so i wasn &apos;t exactly john glenn up there ,
but i &apos;ve changed ; i &apos;m a different man now .
yeah , and i &apos;m a little insulted
that you guys don &apos;t think i can handle it .
you know you &apos;re gonna have to go through survival training again .
really ?
you &apos;ve got to get me out of this !
what do you want me to do ? you &apos;re perfectly healthy .
check my blood pressure again !
i can get it higher ; just give me a second .
hello ?
hi , ma . how are you ?
how i am is not dead !
but you wouldn &apos;t know that ,
because you don &apos;t love me enough to pick up the phone !
go , go , go !
for all you know , i could have slipped in the tub and drowned !
that &apos;s what happened to your aunt ida !
howard , i &apos;m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts .
oh , me , too . i mean , the doctor was willing
to fudge the results , but ...
it just seemed so darned dishonest .
but the mission wouldn &apos;t be for at least a year .
isn &apos;t that enough time to get your blood pressure under ...
look , my blood pressure &apos;s too high , okay ? drop it .
you know , my aunt changed her diet ,
and in a few months , she ...
went to space ?
i don &apos;t think so . now , pass the soy sauce .
hey , not the green one ; the red one .
sheldon , amy , will you please come join us ?
yeah , it &apos;s fun up here .
so why are you trying to ruin it ?
no , thanks . we &apos;re fine .
i mean , if you people want to eat at the table ,
then that &apos;s what you should do .
i like eating down here
because this is how we &apos;ve always done things .
but if those days are gone , they &apos;re gone .
it just ... makes me sad .
now i feel bad .
oh , don &apos;t anthropomorphize him ; he &apos;s got big eyes ,
but his feelings are not like ours .
no , it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups .
well , it &apos;s not silly if you think of that group
as being led by a big , evil baby .
look at amy down there .
should we go ?
yeah , let &apos;s go .
but ... penny , this was your idea .
you said that i should stand up to him .
forget it , leonard .
it &apos;s over .
fine .
rajesh ?
screw that ! i sat on the floor for seven years .
i &apos;m staying right here !
come on , raj , it &apos;s not the same without you .
fine .
but no more making fun of how i say tings .
you mean &quot; tings &quot; like &quot; moo @-@ stache &quot; ?
well , isn &apos;t this nice .
sometimes the baby wins .
