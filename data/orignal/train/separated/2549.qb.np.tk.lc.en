罗伯特 · 彭斯的诗歌 《 答案 》
&quot; even then , a wish , i mind its pow &apos;r ,
a wish that to my latest hour ,
shall strongly heave my breast ,
that i for poor auld scotland &apos;s sake ... &quot;
all right , you little monsters !
you &apos;ve awakened scotland &apos;s shame !
willie , you know you can &apos;t play that torture trumpet to kids .
i &apos;ll just use it to vape , then .
class , i would like you to meet your new teacher ,
retired air force sergeant ms. berrera .
ay , caramba !
air force ?
sergeant ?
a woman ?
good morning , crew .
i am proud to be here educating my country .
for you , teacher .
because if there &apos;s one thing i learned in combat ,
it &apos;s that the most powerful weapon is knowledge .
what &apos;s the second most powerful weapon ?
shoulder @-@ mounted anti @-@ tank missile . duh .
did you ever american sniper someone ?
that &apos;s really not appropriate for me to say .
how many hospitals did you help build ?
negative three .
oh , my god , i &apos;ve got a cool teacher .
what am i doing ? i &apos;m sitting up straight ,
and my hands are folded like a nerd .
i &apos;ve got to fix that .
yes ?
now one &apos;s up in the air .
okay , let &apos;s show this innocent young veteran
what happens when you call on bart simpson .
ma &apos;am , my name is bart ,
and i just want to say how delighted i am that you &apos;re here .
what the hell ?
thank you , bart.
a neck tat ?
milhouse , have you ever thought a teacher was cute ?
oh , yeah . i thought krabappel was smokin &apos; .
i kept every issue of the fourth gradian she was in .

great lady .
* pretty sober *
* i &apos;ve only got one beer inside me *
* pull me over *
* my blood alcohol is .03 *
oh , i like it when the drivers sing their blood alcohol level .
* not so sober *
* so drunk i &apos;ll eat gas station sushi . *
homer , don &apos;t forget to pick up milk .
‭ and not just any milk--
healthy milk , without any hormones .
i won &apos;t forget .
aw , they sell ads in thought bubbles now ?
i &apos;m running a basic errand .
homer simpson buying a healthy product ?
now i have seen all of the things that there are to see .
that will be $ 16 .
and can i interest you in any , uh , milk insurance ?
$ 16 ? !
another case of the rich cows sticking it to the little guy .
okay , don &apos;t worry . we &apos;re going to get you into a milk today .
i like it &apos;s in a plastic bottle
that &apos;ll be around for millions of years .
but is it good for my kids ?
i know you have concerns .
but this video will gloss over all of your questions .
it &apos;d better .
how &apos;s that milk , jimmy ?
boring .
now , we could engineer a new jimmy who is less of a brat ,
but we &apos;ll just use science to jazz things up .
we used to feed boring old grass to cows .
that might have been fine for farmer brown .
but we brought in a next @-@ gen blend of phenyl ketamine ,
ketyl phenamine , and a healthy sprinkling
of transuranic elements .
but don &apos;t worry ,
we still get the milk from good old @-@ fashioned cows .
that &apos;s the best milk i &apos;ve ever had .
you said &quot; milk . &quot;
we can &apos;t , legally .
i &apos;m not the kind of guy advertising works on ,
but i &apos;ll take 20 , no questions asked .
bart , you &apos;re up already ?
don &apos;t want to be late for school .
hair combed , face washed ?
i thought i &apos;d shake things up .
morning , marge . morning , bart.
what the ... ?
is it a court day today ?
let &apos;s see .
nope , today we &apos;re off .
the courthouse is closed because the judge is becoming a citizen .
what gives , boy ?
nothing &apos;s going on .
some days a boy just wants to look
like he &apos;s going to church , okay ?
i &apos;m the last one to breakfast ?
you guys are planning my birthday , right ?
&apos;cause last year &apos;s was kind of lonely .
boy , that &apos;s when i realized
just how big a bowling alley really is .
can we please get a move on ? i do not want to miss any school .
could this punctual bart possibly be connected
to your cute new teacher ?
do i have a cute new sexy teacher ? i hadn &apos;t noticed .
* bart likes his teacher *
* bart likes his teacher *
nothing can turn a boy &apos;s life around like a cute teacher .
like what michelle pfeiffer did for coolio .
in fact , to be supportive , i &apos;ll drive bart to school .
are you just trying to see how cute the teacher is ?
or how handsome he is , marge .
not a he , right , boy ?
no .
even my dad came back for this !
that &apos;s right , son . but , uh , right after this ,
i have to go get some cigarettes .
last time , you never came back .
oh , don &apos;t cry , norman .
that &apos;s not my name !
oh , right . that &apos;s my other abandoned son .
i have a brother !
and just what are you doing ?
putting the first new coat of paint on this school
in 30 years .
it &apos;s always good to have a joker in the platoon .
bart , according to your folder ,
you need some extra help .
can you meet me after class ?
no problemo . i can move my 3 : 30 freeze tag .
just cancel .
bart , i &apos;m glad that you &apos;re trying ,
but i am worried that you &apos;re starting from a place
far behind most students .
it &apos;s because i am so troubled , ma &apos;am .
vulnerable . i need a firm but pretty hand .
would you like martin prince to tutor you ?
no ! last time he was at my house ,
he talked about bird @-@ watching all day .
even my mom got bored , and she loves boredom .
well , i guess i could see you tuesdays after school .
* tuesday *
* afternoon *
* i &apos;m just beginning to see *
* now i &apos;m on my way *
* it doesn &apos;t matter to me *
* chasing the clouds away . *
uh , ms. berrera ?
i was , uh , wondering if you needed any help ,
pulling your maps .
you have to give &apos; em a snap .
otherwise , they just get longer and longer .
oh , my god , he loves her , too .
oh , my god , he loves her , too .
oh , my god , they love me , too !
that &apos;s right . in my head , i sound like this .
no ! no , no , no , no !
what happened ? did jazz die ?
look at me !
acne ? but she &apos;s only eight .
somehow i &apos;m becoming a squeaky @-@ voiced teen !
do you want fries with that ?
what am i saying ? !
i , too , was visited by the ghost of puberty present .
i &apos;ve got a starter &apos; stache . next , i &apos;m a loser ,
then i &apos;m a creep , then i &apos;m a perv .
i &apos;ve got to buy a van .
this isn &apos;t fair .
i &apos;m not ready for my awkward years .
this is my happy childhood , for crying out loud !
dialing for pizza .
somewhere , another mustache is in tremendous pain .
it must be precocious puberty .
it &apos;s a thing . i just read about it in thing magazine .
homer , i &apos;ll fix lisa up ,
and you teach bart to shave .
you got it . but there will be blood .
and there ,
there , and there .
the cream looks delicious , but don &apos;t eat too much .
and there . see how it &apos;s done , boy ?
dad , aren &apos;t you supposed
to take the little plastic thing off the blade ?
really ? i always wondered about that .
well , hello , billy zane .
sweetie , every kid goes through this .
that &apos;s why proms are dark .
just stick some carrots in there three times a day .
so we won &apos;t see your sweet little face for ten more years ?
mom , the inside of this hoodie
is covered in tears .
let me try some makeup .
cruelty @-@ free ?
oh , yes .
i &apos;ll be very gentle .
marge ? marge , you got to see this !
oh , what is it ?
i actually have two different ptsds .
the kind we combat veterans know .
and , also , parent- teacher @-@ student dilemmas .
no !
bart !
do not worry .
i am certified as a paramedic .
teacher , could you kiss my owie ?
boy , owies can only be kissed by willie .
where &apos;s the owie ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
lisa , you look great !
beautiful and mature .
like a sideline reporter .
r @-@ really ?
didn &apos;t know you were so cool .
well , um , uh , well , duh .
oh , my god , i &apos;m popular !
hope this doesn &apos;t go to my head .
it went right to my head !
so when you &apos;re done with this page ,
you will learn how tectonic plates rub against each other
till something gives deep down .
you do not have to tutor this boy
取代 《 不让一个孩子掉队法案 》
under the new one child left behind law .
but he needs help ,
and he &apos;s not going to be a child much longer .
he &apos;s got a mustache coming in .
yeah , so beat it , bald lip .

a or b ?

i &apos;m tired of my son having a mustache like a pool boy .
those pool boys pull in some sweet jingle .
plus , they get to work in flip @-@ flops .
homie , it &apos;s time we figured this out .
maybe milk will help us think .
how would milk do that ?
it &apos;s from cows who are smart enough
not to get turned into hamburger .
i never looked closely at this milk before .
is it made by a soda company ?
they don &apos;t just make soda , marge .
they also make industrial foam .
homer , it &apos;s the milk !
i &apos;ll call the help hotline on the carton .
talk to me .
yes , i need a milk refund .
right . um , address , please ?
wait , wait . hold on .

you know about me and carol ?
you know her name ?
oh , first and middle , and i know more .
her favorite salad bar item is little shredded cheese .
pff . everyone likes that .
oh , i know a lot more than that .
she &apos;s never seen an episode of friends .
not even &quot; the one with ... &quot; ?
no , not one .
and she has a cat with different color eyes .
his name is bowie .
no !
face it , simpson : you can &apos;t compete with me .
i can rent a car .
how can i derail his happiness ?
i got a delivery of live class pets here .
interesting . excuse me . i have one question .
yes .
when you &apos;re in the shower , do you shampoo your mustache ?
of course . it &apos;s a must @-@ stache ,
not an if @-@ you @-@ feel @-@ like @-@ it @-@ stache .

stay within the lip liner ?
a week ago , you &apos;d never even worn makeup .

sherri . terri .
i usually don &apos;t see double until an hour into the party .
it &apos;s going to rain ,
and rain washes off makeup ,
and then they will see me as i truly am--
imperfect , blemished ,
a social mess in a lampshade dress .
okay , all right .
lisa , you were never popular ,
so you &apos;re playing with the house &apos;s money .
attention , party !
i &apos;m not like you .
what i &apos;m saying is , i gave my christmas money to npr .
i have a chemistry set ... that i &apos;ve used !
is there a point to this ?
and beneath all this makeup ,
i have ... problem skin .
what are you talking about ?
your skin is fine .
really ? the bad milk wore off .
so , uh , admitting you &apos;re not cool
is probably the coolest thing you can do , right ?
i will see myself out .
you look ba @-@ lonely .
i feel ba @-@ lonely .
you want to be friends ?
i do .
um , how clean is that hand ?
cleaner now .
okay .
a fish says , &quot; moo ! &quot;
this isn &apos;t gonna last long .
i still take baths in the sink .
okay , it &apos;s over . sorry , ralph .
i &apos;ll be eating crayons for one .
the plan is perfect !
i just have to get skinner to hold still
while i slip a firecracker in his butt .
come on , give it up .
bart , i realized what &apos;s been going on .
we &apos;ve been operating under the influence of hormones .
hormones ? sounds far @-@ fetched .
very far @-@ fetched .
well , it &apos;s true , so give skinner a shot .
everyone deserves happiness .
even wieners .
dad , how much does the mustache fairy pay ?
three bucks .
when you asked me to go skating , i really thought you knew how .

carol , he &apos;s all yours .

and , uh , up she skates now .
my son , i just want to say , i wish the four of you the best .
four of us ?
you , her , your model planes and nudie books .
sorry , seymour .
now i can &apos;t look at you without picturing it .
oh , my room &apos;s not that bad .
i &apos;m talking about your mother .
listen , want to roast marshmallows ?
i &apos;d like that .
great , man , great .

thank you , simpson .
that does feel better .
fire looks like it &apos;s dying down .
终身记录
thanks , man .
well , i guess a lot of women leave their men
to go back and serve in afghanistan .
no one drives &apos; em away like you , seymour .
最后一期 不再是东西
well , no more makeup for me . ever !
what about when you &apos;re blowing your stupid horn
at carnegie hall ?
if you say it out loud , it won &apos;t come true !
