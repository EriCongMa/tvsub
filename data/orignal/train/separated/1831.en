I have an 18-year-old daughter.
I'm having a baby, and, um,
I don't have anywhere else to go.
Dr.Bailey, have you seen the chief?
There's something wrong with his emergency chole patient.
You may have accidentally clipped the common bile duct.
That's one of the most serious mistakes a general surgeon can make.
Have you told anyone what you saw?
Have you told Derek? Um...
No.
I have loved you forever.
I'm in love with Christina.
We assume the really serious changes in our lives
happen slowly...
over time.
But it's not true.
The big stuff happens in an instant.
You're up early.
Yeah, I want to, uh, get some stuff done
so that I can meet the chief this afternoon.
He's gonna show me another old surgery tape.
Again? Every night this week.
I thought last night was the last time.
He got held up. He couldn't make it.
Yeah, I went by his office on my way out.
He was sound asleep on his couch.
Which is why he couldn't make it.
I think maybe he just doesn't sleep well at home
with Adele gone.
I need something from you.
Well... that, too.
I need you to give Sloan an ultrasound today.
It's been almost three weeks.
Can't someone from O.B. Do it?
Yeah. But...
She likes you.
All the Sloans do.
Hey, do we have any more-- oh! Ew!
Whoa. Sloan!
Becoming an adult,
Becoming a parent, becoming a doctor--
One minute you're not, and the next...
Sloan.
You are.
Sorry about that.
Whatever. There's no more cereal.
Why are you sorry?
She's the one who didn't knock before she came in.
I'll get some cereal this afternoon.
How about some juice?
Uh, Lexie's gonna give you an ultrasound today.
Why don't you pick up some breakfast at the hospital?
It's gonna be more.
You need some for lunch, too?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna shower.
Oh, can you hold on a minute?
I'm probably gonna have to hurl this.
Sloan Sloan monopolizing your bathroom again?
Yeah. Yours?
Owen's mine.
Oh, god.
They're in there.
Yeah, you should knock first.
I'm late. Okay? My hair is dirty.
And he just gave her 80 bucks for a muffin and a sandwich.
That's quite a sandwich.
She's just gonna end up spending it
on a pair of jeans that show off her butt crack,
And then she's gonna ask me for half of my pasta salad.
You sound like my mother.
Um, knock much?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Oh, there's no more hot water.
Ask any doctor, and they can point
to the one moment they became physician.
It usually isn't med school graduation day.
Yang... you're going solo today.
Uh, been there.
Cardio solo.
Whatever it is...
Valve replacement.
Nobody forgets it.
Uh, porcine or...
Mechanical.
So I can try out the subannular stitches.
Well, I didn't teach it to you so you could crochet.
Okay, thank you.
Oh, my god.
What? What?
Uh... Altman's letting her go solo on a valve.
Wow. Uh, you feel ready?
She's ready. She just needs to breathe.
I am breathing.
I am a living, breathing cardiothoracic surgeon
as of right now.
I have to go prep.
Sometimes you don't even know anything's changed.
You think you're still you
and your life is still your life,
but you wake up day and look around,
and you don't recognize anything...
Not anything at all.
一瞬
Hey, do you have any cash?
I lost the headset to my phone.
How about you hold the phone up to your ear?
You were the one that was bitching at me last night
for being on the phone so late.
Maybe if I had a headset,
I wouldn't have to talk so loud.
Maybe if you had your own apartment,
You could talk whenever you want,
but we're all making compromises.
Okay, here's the head.
It looks like alien.
Well, it's gonna be a very cute alien.
A boy alien or girl?
Dude, does it have a thing or not?
No, I'm not looking at the sex.
Um, I don't...
You... I--I'm new at this. I'm--I'm not very good.
So, um, why don't we go upstairs to--
There's a better machine upstairs.
Uh, maybe we'll have someone else take a look.
Adamson, you're with me.
Meredith, you're with bailey. Karev, you're with torres.
Tom Kates is in this ambulance.
The quarterback?
Yeah.
If you see photographers, call security.
Tell your interns no autographs, no pictures.
I see anyone pull out a camera phone,
It's going in the toilet.
So there are three of us on one patient?
Oh, come on. He's a high-profile patient.
He gets a lot of attention.
I thought we agreed to stop meeting like this?
Hey, what can I say, man? I missed your smiling face.
Good to see you.
Head trauma,
but G.C.S. 15 since regaining consciousness.
He got high/lowed by a couple of their linebackers.
Dropped like a rock.
Okay, get x-ray in here for a trauma series.
Tenderness in the upper left quadrant.
I'm gonna need a c.T.
Got it. Oh, there's pain and crepitance in the knee.
Uh, get an x-ray of the left knee with the trauma series.
Yeah.
I saw that hit. That was a bad hit.
I-I knew it the minute I saw it.
I knew before you even hit the ground,
that was bad.
Hey, hi, sweetheart.
Oh, and that's my boy.
Oh, he's very cute.
Dr. Shepherd
He's gonna be fine. He's gonna be fine.
Now I can't have you in here with the baby, okay?
Okay, um, littlest high-five in the world.
Hey, we'll come and find you
The second we know what's going on.
I love you, babe.
Don't give him too much morphine.
It makes him goofy.
Won't, I won't.
How great is that kid, huh?
He's pretty great.
Did you tell sloan to move out?
No. Not that it's a bad idea, but...
You're making her feel like crap.
She said you wouldn't even be
alone in a room with her.
No, that--that's not--
Then why do I have to chaperone the ultrasound?
Because there's something wrong with the baby.
See right there on the left thigh.
Yeah. On his other ankle, too.
Wait. It's a boy?
I hadn't gotten that far.
Oh! Oh, sorry. Congratulations.
Uh, there's a lot of swelling on the right foot.
It's... it's very constricted.
What the hell aer you talking about?
Well, the baby's got strands
Of amniotic tissue wrapped around his legs.
They're called amniotic bands.
There's a danger of them compromising one of his limbs.
So what? One of his legs is gonna, like, fall off?
That's the worst-case scenario.
He's gonna have stumps?
We don't know what we're dealing with yet.
Whatever it is, we're gonna take care of it.
I can't have a stumpy baby. Can't you fix it?
Um, I don't know. You know,
I have an idea.
How about we don't answer any patient questions
with the phrase, "Um, I don't know"?
We're gonna fix it. Uh, let's, uh, get a fetal M.R.I.
You know, I'm not sure that I would recommend...
I wasn't talking to you. You're done.
I'll be right back.
Get me Addison Montgomery.
I adore you.
I was in the middle of breakfast.
Uh, she had an M.R.I. Right's worse than the left...
I just need to say it once.
Go ahead.
Grandpa. Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa.
Oh, okay. That was four times.
Is it out of your system?
I don't know.
Look at that. He thinks he's got an opening behind Martin,
And then-- ooh! Ouch.
Back that up again.
Okay, I would never ask for an autograph,
but if he signed a consent form
And there was a copy laying around
Torres.
what? Big fan.
What?
Oh, hey!
Look who's here.
Hi. Did you get lost on the freeway?
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Sloan's got a little something going on with the baby.
Oh, is she okay?
We'll figure it out.
I'm gonna go see if they're ready.
Okay.
You know how long I've been waiting for that?
What, you pull out his blood with leeches?
Uh, she's perkier than usual.
Well, divorce will do that to you.
Ah, sad.
No, she'll move on and be happy.
Yeah. She just needs somebody to move on to.
Well, that can't be so hard.
Hey, wait. What about you? Can't you find her someone?
That guy from oncology,
the cute one, isn't he still here?
This is not my area.
He used to play basketball with him.
Dave
Torres should do it. They're friends.
Oh, she thinks I'm loopy.- You are loopy.
Okay, come on. It's bailey. She's lonely.
I...
He needs a transfusion.
That splenic lac is bleeding more than I thought.
All right. We'll take a look at the C.T.S
And come up with a, uh, game plan.
All set.
Ah. Okay. I'm coming with you.
You know dave from oncology?
Single.
You wouldn't be starting a conversation about my personal life, would you?
Bad idea? He's handsome.
Bad idea.
Okay. I tried.
Hi, Ruthie. This is Dr. Yang.
She'll be performing your surgery today.
She is the best of the best. You're gonna like her.
Oh, good. I am so glad to meet you.
Hi.
Um, I have a couple things I want to discuss. Oh.
Is that--can I...
of course, of course.
Um, I have allergies. Mm-hmm.
I-I know they write them in the chart,
But I find that if you don't tell everyone,
You know, it kind of gets lost in the shuffle.
Yeah.
Aspirin, ibuprofen, bananas, zucchini,
All forms of squash.
And pumpkin is a squash, right?
Mm-hmm. People forget that. Latex, dust mites.
Y-- uh, I asked the nurse with the red hair
For a new pillow,
And, um... I would also love to get a new nurse.
Because I think the redhair just brought back
the old pillow with a new case, and it's,
You know... it's making me sneezy.
And I'm supposed to get a mechanical valve. Mm-hmm.
But I've been thinking about the clicking noise
They say the mechanical valve makes...
I mean, that--that would be irritating, right?
Don't you think that might just make you nuts?
I'm sorry, but, uh, a different valve
is a whole different procedure.
Yes, but I-I think the pig is a better idea--the pig valve.
You know, it's organic, right? And they say they're very clean.
You know, all that business about,
"Oh, you're such a pig, "Right? That's just bad marketing.
Oh, and this, uh, blanket.. this has a smell.
Yeah, it does. It does smell.
Like, a-a--I'm not saying it's not clean. It's like a--
A chemical of some kind, it's chaffing.
Can you see my rash?
As the legs continue to grow,
The bands will cut off his circulation.
If we wait, we risk severe damage to the left leg,
Possible loss of the right entirely.
But if we operate--22 weeks, it's--it's still risky.
But if you don't operate, you're not gonna kill the baby.
We can rehabilitate the remaining part of his leg
After he's born, and we can fit him with a prosthesis.
It's entirely possible that he'll walk.
Oh, my god.
Honey, we've got options here.
If we operate, Dr.Montgomery can remove the bands,
He'll be just fine.
Or we can wait a few weeks till he's bigger and stronger,
And we know the surgery is less risky.
Well, which one of you did he sleep with?
Oh, not me.
You told her?
She's my kid. We were bonding.
That is not how you bond with children.
I'm still getting the hang of it.
So you're sure that he didn't, like, knock you up
And leave you with a child
to raise on your own or something?
You're not just, like, really pissed
And you're trying to get revenge?
No. No.
It--it was a long time ago, okay?
The fact is, Mark--
Your father-- is--is a good guy,
And I think you're a good kid, and I'm gonna do
everything I can to help you with your baby.
Okay, well, let's just get these things off his legs Right now.
I'll book an O.R.
Stupid quarterback only has a concussion.
Tragic.
I know.
I'm on his ortho stuff.
There's bound to be a surgery in there.
You want to share?
Why would I do that?
'Cause you like me.
Not that much.
Oh, sure you do. Come on.
Let me scrub in,
And I will take you out for drinks afterwards
And, you know...
Really?
Okay.
What?
Let me take you out for drinks and, you know?
What's "You know"?
Whatever.
It's sex.
Charlie, get over it.
You're trading sex for surgery that's prostitution.
Is that the part I'm supposed to get over?
Are you calling me a whore?
Explain what "You know" Means.
I'm messing with him. Karev knows it, and I know it.
He's gonna want to collect.
Charlie... go find something else to worry about.
Dr. Bailey...
This is, uh, Dr. Stanton from radiology.
Rob, Miranda.
Rob was looking over Tom's C.T.,
And I thought he should talk to you.
Oh, okay.
Rob's new here, so I thought you might give him
a tour of the hospital while you discuss the C.T.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
You spent Christmas with me and Meredith.
That can't be what you want.
True, but I do have a patient
that I have to do a follow-up on right now.
So I don't have time to take anybody
I can do that.
Follow-up's easy. I can do that.
Have fun. Take care.
Okay, have a good tour.
You want to show me the scan?
Um, how about we, uh, look at it over lunch?
I'm in the middle of a divorce.
People call me the nazi,
And it's not because of my ice blue eyes.
I spend 12 hours a day carving people up, and I like it.
I have a child, and I have no room for casual anything.
I'm angry all of the time and deeply confused
Because a lot of people in my life have let me down recently.
One of them was me.
It's devastating, but not completely,
Because it turns out I like sleeping crosswise in the bed
And not having to shave my legs.
My 3 year old used to be potty trained,
and now he isn't
Because his father no longer lives with us
And his world no longer makes sense,
And the only thing he thinks he can control is his bladder.
So he urinates
In a lot of places you wish he wouldn't urinate.
You want lunch or you want to show me the scan?
Mr. Morris. Dr. Shepherd.
I'll be filling in for dr. Bailey today.
So you're here for a follow-up?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I had my gall bladder out a couple months ago.
Months? And you're still getting follow-ups?
I am, once a week.
Once a week?
Yeah. Dr. Bailey says she just wants to make sure
I'm in tip-top shape.
Dr. Webber did your surgery?
Yeah. Chief of surgery.
Fancy, huh?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
You guys are the best.
People say a lot of crap about health care,
But they've never been here.
You take care of people.
We certainly do. Yeah.
Mm. Dr. Bailey wll worried
'cause I turned yellow after my first surgery.
Mm-hmm. Oh, see?
Here.
But it went away.
I'm fine now. You want to look at my scar
Or wait till after I pee in the cup?
Oh, dr. Altman, uh, the patient is no longer interested
He mechanical valve.
Well, I couldn't give you a total unadulterated dream case.
People would talk.
Uh, I just spent hours prepping for the mechanical.
A-a pig valve is a whole different surgery.
Two for the price of one.
Just think about how much you're learning.
You want me to get someone else?
No.
It's a concussion. It's no worse than you've seen before.
Nothing we need to go in and fix.
Initially we thought
The injury to your spleen would resolve itself,
But it's bleeding too much. Dr. Bailey needs to go in
And remove it as soon as possible.
The surgery is gonna have you out for a couple of weeks,
But you'll be back in the game for next season.
Tom? You all right?
Oh, I can't--I can't-- I can't breathe.
Let's get some oxygen.
Get a crash cart. Tom?
Let's get some oxygen, all right?
I can't breathe.
Let's get an e.K.G. Just in case.
Tom, have you ever had a panic attack before?
I'm fine.
It's just, uh...
It's nothing.
There's daddy.
Hey, how's my guy? He's fine.
How's my guy?
Well, he was, um--
The, um, brain's okay.
But they gotta cut my belly open.
I can't play till next season.
Honey...
Don't worry.
Next season will be here before you know it.
What's the deal with you and Reed?
Nothing.
You're not trading her surgery for sex, are you?
Give me a break,
Because if you are, it's gross.
Look, if I sleep with her, it's 'cause I want to.
You gonna look me in the eye
And tell me derek never threw a craniotomy your way
After the two of you spent an hour in the on-call room?
Please.
I know it may not feel like it,
but you are still married,
and izzie is coming-- you know what?
I'm done worrying about izzie
'cause she sure as hell ain't worried about me.
This is the old alex--
Sleeping with some random person
Because you're angry and hurt.
That's what you always did.
And then we grew up and got married.
Yeah, well, it turns out your stupid post-it
Is ten times the marriage my church wedding ever got me.
I'm moving on.
Hey, Tom Kates is having panic attacks?
Yeah. I don't know why. He's not talking.
I took care of your, uh, chole patient. It's all good.
Uh, thanks.
Yeah, he's getting some high-class care.
Six visits with a surgeon?
A nurse practitioner could do this.
No, I like to do, uh, aftercare myself.
He wasn't even your patient. He was the chief's.
There was an error.
He's fine.
So why all the--
I have a thing for him, okay?
Sheldon Morris?
He caught my eye.
Sheldon has a quality that I'm... Drawn to.
I... I can't put my finger on what it is exactly.
Sure. Sure.
Want to keep his picture?
Do you know what my sister had for lunch today?
Pork chops. I watched her eat.
I didn't feel any kinship... with the pig.
I think the pig valve, you know, may be the wrong choice.
Uh, you feel more kinship with cows?
I don't know.
Mrs. Carlin, um,
we've prepared the porcine valve replacement.
Uh, a bovine replacement is a whole different surgery,
Like the mechanical valve was a whole different surgery.
Do you think it's possible that I could see the valves--
Right, the pig and the cow? Cause maybe then I could--
I could recognize one as more familiar.
Well, we don't do that.
We don't march the parts around the hospital.
Maybe we should call this off.
Can I do that?
If you're not comfortable, we can postpone it.
Uh, no, no, no, no. I mean, I-I can get the valves...
And I'll bring them here.
Oh! Okay?
You're so wonderful.
You really are. You're...
Okay. Great.
Great.
She's so wonderful.
She is.
Oh!
Richard... Tom Kates needs a splenectomy.
Any chance I can get you to do the procedure?
Oh, well, I've, uh, asked Bailey to take over my service.
You know, with-- with the merger and all.
It's a high-profile patient.
I thought you could make an exception.
Sure.
You must have extras lying around.
We don't.
What, you--you never drop one?
Open up the box and see
that the pig has a cholesterol problem?
Let me check in the back.
Okay.
She thinks maybe one of them will speak to her.
It's ringing.
I mean, I am prepping
for three different surgeries in one day.
Chasing animal parts all over the hospital.
Teddy thinks it's hysterical, but this may actually kill me.
Maybe one of them will speak to her.
There are pros and cons for each.
At the end of the day,
it's a gut thing--pig or cow?
It's not a gut thing.
It's a decision based on fact and reason.
Hey! Where are my parts?
Izzie, it's me.
Um, I know you want space, but you can't have space.
Because Alex might be moving on.
Come back and work in the clinic,
cause you're throwing your career away.
Cristina.
She got fired from surgery, not all medicine.
Ignore her. Just call me back. Okay, bye.
There. That wasn't so difficult, was it?
Okay. Got the first band.
Let's move down so I can take a look at the second.
Like that?
Good.
Why can't I grab his leg?
Problem?
No, it's just one of the bands is holding the leg in place
making it a little difficult to get around.
Can you move the ultrasound up here?
Oh, come on.
What's the matter?
Her uterine arteries are engorged.
But the only way in is in between them.
Okay, I'm gonna need another trocar.
You want to hold this?
Are you sure you have enough room?
Those arteries are huge.
That's why I'm gonna be very, very careful. Scalpel.
What happens if you nick them?
Dr. Grey?
She could bleed out. They both could.
I don't like it. It's too dangerous.
Mark, I have assessed the risk factors.
I'm 95% confident I can get around the arteries.
I'm choosing to continue my surgery.
And I don't like the other 5%.
You hit any one of those.
She bleeds out right on this table.
Look, you're nervous. I get that.
I'm a surgeon, and I'm looking at
a time bomb in a uterus.
Shut it down. Now, Addison.
Let's close her up.
You good to go?
Yeah. What, are you babysitting?
Cause I'm new at this.
Where's the chief?
I don't know. Check his office.
He said he was gonna do the surgery.
And then he told me he didn't have time
and asked me if I would do it,
Which I was planning on doing in the first place, so I said yes.
Uh, he said something about a budget meeting.
I think he's pretty swamped.
If he's got time to watch old surgical films with you,
he's not swamped.
What the hell is going on?
The chole patient, your boyfriend?
That was the chief's mistake.
And he hasn't touched a patient since then.
He's been busy with the merger.
Yeah, I've heard that story before.
What is going on?
It is not my job to get involved in his personal life.
Just like it's not your job to get involved in mine.
10-blade.
I made a judgment call. You didn't like it.
I'm sorry.
You threw me on a plane in the middle of my morning coffee
Because you wanted my judgment.
It was risky.
That is not your call to make in my o.R.
You acted like a father.
Why do you think we don't let parents in the room
during an operation?
I'm not her father, Addison.
Biologically, yes, but... I just met the kid.
I'm helping out.
You reacted like a parent.
Now I don't know when, I don't know how.
But at some point, you became a dad to that little urchin.
Because you just lost it in my o.R..
And Mark Sloan never loses it in the o.R.
Not ever.
Yes, it was risky,
And, yes, most surgeons would've jumped ship
at the sight of the engorged arteries.
But I am not most surgeons, and neither are you.
Look, we can try this again...
with you in the waiting room.
It's too risky. She's just a kid.
Well, uh, have Morrison
Monitor the bands as the baby grows.
It might be okay.
I gotta go. Patients at home.
Congratulations.
You're a parent.
Neither one is speaking to me.
Oh, for god sake.
Are they speaking to you?
They aren't.
Ruthie, if I put your own valve in front of you,
It wouldn't speak to you either.
I have a cousin. His wife is a cardiologist.
I should call her.
No, no, no, okay? No.
No more calls. This is about you and your heart.
And you need to use your instinct and make a decision.
Right now-- Pig or cow?
But I...
Pig or cow?
Pig or cow? Don't think. Just...pig or cow? Go.
Now! Now!
Pig. No. Cow.
Pig! Pig! Pig. Pig.
Pig.
The procedure went well.
You're gonna be back on your feet in no time.
Great.
Great.
You're scared to play.
You thought you were done.
And when I said you'd be back in the game next season,
You panicked.
Um... I used to be able to block out the fear.
But ever since Des was born,
I'm...I'm on that field, and my heart starts racing,
And I can't catch my breath.
You know, I look at guys who played their whole careers.
They're hit so many times, they can barely remember
their own names.
And I'm scared he's gonna grow up without a dad.
I'm scared all the time.
It's a natural reaction. You're a father.
Why don't you retire?
Oh, come on. Two years into a pro career?
I mean, I can't.
I mean, I know I'm not a soldier in Iraq
or--or a rocket scientist
or any kind of real hero.
I know I'm just some big, dumb jock.
But I'm a big, dumb jock the entire city... roots for.
kids, guys on the street...
I can't let them down.
This is the trade off.
I get hit.
Mm. Some guys can't even feed their families, you know?
And some guys are soldiers in iraq,
And they get shot at.
So--so I'm not complaining.
I'm just...
I'm scared of the hits.
I want to be able to remember who my kid is.
Okay, no more bubbles.
Okay, pressures are good. Let's come off.
Decannulating.
I told Torres she had to let you scrub in if she was cutting.
Cool.
Book an on-call room.
What...what happened to drinks first?
Ah, it's kind of a waste of time, right?
Cut to the chase.
Hey, Reed.
Do you know Izzie Stevens?
Grey.
Yes. I met her before she got fired.
You know she's Alex's wife.
And she's not here right now, but they're still married.
Meredith, shut up.
No. Some people think you're divorced,
and you're not.
Uh, you know, how about you just shut up
long enough to watch your friend tank her valve?
How...what?
She's tachycardic.
Suction.
Take this. Laps. I need more laps.
Someone get me a sponge stick, please.
I'm having difficulty locating the bleeder.
Dr. Altman?
Keep looking.
B.P.'s dropping.
Well, how come Altman's not doing anything?
Suction. More suction.
Yeah, knee looks like crap.
But that's been true for a long time.
He should be able to play through the pain.
What if he can't?
What about a knee replacement, right now?
He needs to stop.
How about we make it so it's not his idea?
Systolic's down to 80.
I could suture directly or clamp.
I don't know which one to do.
I don't know either.
Well, my guess is, is if you came and looked at it,
You'd have a better idea.
I'm sure that's true,
but I'm not the one operating.
This is a lot of blood.
She's crashing!
You're overthinking it.
Dr. Yang
Look at the aorta. What does it tell you?
That I have two options, and I don't know which one to do.
This is crazy. Why isn't she helping her?
How's it going?
Yang's killing her patient,
And Altman's reading "The atlantic monthly."
If I suture, it might not hold,
If I clamp, uh, it--it could rupture.
Her b.P.'s tanking.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm teaching, and she's learning.
She needs help. She may be too proud to say it,
but how about we don't let this patient die
and give her a hand anyhow?
She asked. She's not that proud. And I said no.
This patient is not going to die.
She is going to save the patient.
Pig or cow?
You are sitting on your hands - because you are angry with me.
Get over yourself.
If that patient...
Dr. Hunt, you are blowing my concentration.
Now get out of my OR.
Pig or cow? Pig or cow? Pig or cow? Pig or cow?
Pig. Clamp. 3-0 wood pledget.
Dr. Torres and I think your knee needs replacing.
Well, that's been true since college.
There's just too much degeneration.
The joint is completely shot.
You need a unicondylar repair,
or you may lose the ability to walk.
But a knee replacement
will take me out of the game forever.
Exactly.
Okay, it's-- it's coming up.
Look, right there.
Look at that.
That's the minute we knew your mother was different.
Oh, and that other hand holding the retractor? That's Garber.
He was the chief of surgery back then.
No one could believe it.
She walked in that room a resident
and walked out a legend.
Derek was worried when you didn't show up
for the, uh, Tom Kates surgery.
Yeah, Derek worries.
That makes him a good guy. Oh, look, look, look, look, look.
If Dr. Montgomery had hit it during the procedure...
It's dangerous.
Well, what about that band that's squeezing his thigh?
He's not even gonna have a knee?
Sloan, you could have died.
Well, I can't have a gimpy kid.
Honey, I know I haven't been your father for long,
But if you say "gimp" one more time, I'm gonna smack you.
You don't get it.
He needs legs. Okay?
He doesn't have a dad, and he's got a stupid, slutty mom.
Don't you see?
I've already hurt him enough by giving him me as a mother.
He needs feet.
Sloan--
Look, I don't know how to take care of any baby, okay?
I can't have one that's hurt. I just can't handle it.
My mom doesn't even talk to me.
I'm doing this alone.
Please.
Listen...
You're not stupid.
And you're not slutty.
The Sloans...
are a... passionate people.
You dragged yourself across the country
so that you could get help taking care of this baby.
That's not being stupid.
That's being a mom.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you or the baby.
Go to L.A.
Addison said 95%. That's not that bad.
Let her do the surgery.
Looks like we're going to L.A.
You're not gonna do this alone.
Stay.
After the baby's born, live with me and Lexie.
Raise the baby with us.
I don't know anything about being a dad.
You don't know anything about being a mom.
Maybe we could...
figure it all out together.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.
Drill, please.
Are you sure there's nothing I can do to help?
Uh, no.
So I'm not gonna get to do anything in this surgery.
Not worth what you paid for it?
Shut up.
You guys are all worked up about how
none of you get to operate anymore. But you know what?
At some point, you'll log enough hours with a scalpel.
At some point, you'll be surgeons.
And one day...
you'll look up and realize,
"wow, there's more in the world than cutting."
Tom Kates' career is ending.
That is what's happening in this room.
So could you for one second
think about something other than yourselves?
Bone saw.
God. I can't believe I'm taking out
the best quarterback Seattle's ever seen.
You're not.
He was out of the game a long time ago.
I would have stepped in.
I would not have let that patient get hurt.
I know that.
She needs to be pushed. She's like a racehorse.
You need to push her, otherwise she's gonna lose her mind.
I know, Teddy.
So nothing else was going on in that room?
Owen...
You ready to pay up?
Oh, that was the lamest assist in history.
It's hardly worth...
Oh, no. A deal's a deal.
Look, okay, there might have been a little misunderstanding
about what "you know" means.
I-I don't--I don't trade surgery for sex.
If you want sex...
ask for it.
If you want surgery,
go kiss an attending's ass, not mine.
Hey, this is illegal and immoral and...
and you two should be ashamed of yourselves.
Charlie, go to hell.
How am I the bad guy here?
I should've asked you first,
but I was so excited.
And I was so sure it was the right thing.
And you know why? 'cause of you.
Since you, I know, for the first time in my life,
what the right thing is.
I am happy for you. I really am.
Something happened today.
You became a dad, a real one.
And Sloan, against all odds, became a mom.
But I didn't.
I was barely ready to move in with you,
Never mind your daughter and--and--and grandbaby.
I-I just... I don't want this.
You wanted to give your liver to your dad.
This is what you do for family, right?
I understand why you're doing it.
I just don't understand why I'm doing it.
Well, I think you're doing it for me.
Don't make me out to be the selfish one.
You don't get to unilaterally decide
To let a teenager and her infant move into our house.
Well, we'll get a bigger place. She needs us.
Lexie...
I thought I missed this.
This is a chance for me.
Don't make me choose between you and her.
Why?
'Cause you'll choose her?
Yeah.
I'll choose her.
I think our relationship just ended.
Something's going on with the chief,
And I can't figure it out.
I think he's scared to operate.
Is that possible?
You don't know or you're not gonna tell me?
Did you see that? Oh, I'm holding the heart,
I-I feel it almost starting to fibrillate in my hand--
I mean, piss-poor aortic tissue, I mean, possibly irreparable--
And then--bam.
Sutures hold and it comes back.
Please. I know. I don't want to see the face.
I-I-I don't want to hear what you have to say.
I-I was fine. I was on fire. I know that.
I was learning. I felt alive for the first time
In I don't know how long, Owen.
I was--it was like I had air in my lungs--
She's leaving... Seattle.
It's just not gonna work for her.
When I lost my nerve, the chief helped me.
It's... nothing.
If it's nothing, find a way to look me in the eye.
What are you doing in here?
Moving in.
No. No, no, no, no.
I'm--I'm sick of living in that damn trailer.
Go live in Izzie's old room.
You go. She's your wife.
I thought you were shacking up with what's his face.
I'm not.
The post-it didn't say anything about lying
Because I didn't think it needed it.
I'm not lying.
You don't need to know every thought in my head.
I have relationships that don't involve--
Meredith, what are you doing?
I'm too young to be a grandmother.
I'm still supposed to be working like a dog
And--and--and then come home and do stupid things,
Like bungee jumping and jell-o shots.
I don't even know
What people my own age do anymore.
I know something stupid you can do.
You never forget the moment you become a doctor.
I don't know.
I-I-I...
I keep telling myself there's no problem,
But if there's no problem, then why can't I just say it?
A switch flips...
Suddenly you're not playing dress up anymore.
You own the white coat.
Dr. Altman, wait. Wait.
What do you want? I-I--more money?
'cause I'll talk to the chief.
No, I--no--
You know, they can set up a new cardio unit with a--
With a research lab or-- or
You can work with vets.
It isn't about that.
Wait. Wait. No one--no one has ever believed in me like this.
You believe in me more than I do,
And I need that. I... I'm gonna die here without that.
Cristina, it's so complicated.
I can't--
You know, it's okay. Just--fine.
Tell me what you want, and I will make it happen.
I want owen.
Fine! Done! Take him.
What you may not notice
Is the moment that being a doctor...
Changes you.
