magic is about to happen !
well , eva ...
... we &apos;ve done some excellent work here .
and i would have to say ...

all you want is a tinkle
what you envy &apos;s a schwang
a thing through which you can tinkle
to play with or simply let hang
the one with the butt
i feel violated .

l &apos; m sorry !
i don &apos;t see it !
t ry to look through it .
unfocus your eyes .
focus ? there &apos;s nothing to focus on .
it &apos;s the statue of liberty !
right !
where &apos;s the statue of liberty ?
there .
i can &apos;t not see it now .
hey , kids !
come here . do you see anything here ?
lt looks like a boat .
a boat .
right in front of the statue of liberty .
it &apos;s been seven seconds , and you haven &apos;t asked me how my date went .
how was your date , chandler ?
it was unbelievable !
i &apos;ve never met anyone like her . she &apos;s had an amazing life !
she was in the israeli army .
none of the bullets hit the engine , so we made it to the border .
but just barely , and l ....
i &apos;ve been talking about myself all night long . i &apos;m sorry .
what about you ? t ell me a story .
all right , once ...
... i got on the subway .
and it was at night ...
... and i rode it all the way to brooklyn .
just for the hell of it .
we talked until 2 : 00 . it was perfect .
more or less .
suddenly , we realized we were in yemen .
i &apos; m sorry , so &quot; we &quot; is ... ?
&quot; we &quot; is me and rick .
who &apos;s rick ?
who &apos;s rick ?
my husband .
oh , so you &apos; re divorced ?
no .
i &apos; m sorry . so you &apos; re widowed ? hopefully ?
no , l &apos; m still married .
so , how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me ...
... sliding your foot so far up my leg you can count the change in my pocket ?
don &apos;t worry .
he &apos;d be okay with you because he &apos;s okay with ethan .
ethan ? there &apos;s an ethan ?
ethan is my boyfriend .
what ?
what kind of relationship do you imagine us having ...
... if you have a husband and a boyfriend ?
i suppose , mainly sexual .
sorry it didn &apos;t work out .
what , not work out ? i &apos;m seeing her again on thursday .
didn &apos;t you listen to the story ?
didn &apos;t you listen ?
it &apos;s twisted ! how could you get involved with her ?
i had trouble with it at first . but i get the good stuff .
all the fun , all the talking , all the sex ...
... and none of the responsibility .
this is every guy &apos;s fantasy !
that &apos;s not true !
ross , is this your fantasy ?
no , of course not .
yeah . yeah , it is .
you &apos;d go out with someone going out with someone else ?
i couldn &apos;t .
good for you .
when l &apos; m with a woman , i need to know ...
... i &apos; m going out with more people than her .
once , i went out with a guy who just got divorced .
it was hard . his kids liked me better than him .
what does this have to do with chandler ?
nothing .
i didn &apos;t have anything on that topic .
so i went another way .
you know , monogamy can be a tricky concept .
i mean , anthropologically speaking
fine . now you &apos;ll never know .
we &apos; re kidding . t ell us .
we wanna know .
come on !
all right . there &apos;s a theory put forth by richard leakey
are we greeting each other this way now ? i like it .
look ! i cleaned !
i did the windows . i did the floors .
i used all the vacuum attachments but the round one . what &apos;s it for ?
nobody knows . and we &apos;re not supposed to ask .
what do you think ?
it &apos;s very clean .
really , it looks great !
i see you moved the green ottoman .
how did that happen ?
i don &apos;t know . it looked better there .
and it &apos;s an extra seat around the table .
yeah , it &apos;s interesting .
but you know what ? just for fun ...
... iet &apos;s see what it looked like in the old spot .
just to compare .
let &apos;s see .
well , it looks good there too .
let &apos;s leave it there for a while .
i can &apos;t believe you moved the green ottoman .
be glad you didn &apos;t fan the magazines . she &apos;ll scratch your eyes out .
you guys , i am not that bad !
yeah , you are .
remember , i lived with you ? you were a little ....
that is so unfair !
when we were kids , yours was the only raggedy ann doll that wasn &apos;t raggedy .
okay , so i &apos;m responsible . i &apos;m organized .
but hey , i can be a kook !
all right , you madcap gal !
imagine this .
the phone bill arrives , but you don &apos;t pay it right away .
why not ?
because you &apos;re a kook !
you wait until they send a notice .
i could do that .
okay , then you let me go grocery shopping
no problem .
i &apos;m not done yet .
and i buy detergent , but it &apos;s not the one with the easy @-@ pour spout .
why would someone do that ?
one might wonder .
but i would be fine with that .
a glass is on the table with no coaster . a cold drink . a hot day .
beads of condensation are inching closer to the wood ....
stop it !
oh , my god !
it &apos;s true . who am l ?
monica , you &apos; re mom .
oh , my god !
okay , i &apos;ll be there .
that was my agent .
my agent has just gotten me a job in the new al pacino movie !
that &apos;s great !
what &apos;s the part ?
can you believe it ? pacino ! this guy &apos;s why i became an actor !
&quot; out of order ? you &apos; re out of order ! this whole courtroom &apos;s out of order ! &quot;
seriously , what &apos;s the part ?
&quot; just when i thought i was out , they pull me back in ! &quot;
come on . seriously , joey , what &apos;s the part ?
you &apos; re .... what ?
i &apos; m his butt double , okay ?
i play al pacino &apos;s butt .
all right ? he goes into the shower , and then ...
... i &apos; m his butt .
oh , my god !
come on , you guys .
it &apos;s a real pacino movie and that &apos;s big !
it &apos;s terrific . you deserve this .
after years of struggling you &apos;ve cracked your way into show business .
fine . make jokes , i don &apos;t care .
this is a big break for me !
you &apos; re right . it is .
so , will you invite us to the big opening ?
i need some moisturizer .
for what ?
t oday &apos;s the big day !
you got any tweezers ? i think i have a rogue hair .
god . go in the bathroom . use whatever you want .
don &apos;t ever tell me what you did in there .
thank you .
joey &apos;s mom &apos;s on the phone .
ln the bathroom .
you don &apos;t wanna go in there !
come on , we &apos; re roommates .
my eyes ! my eyes !
i warned you .
who is being loud ?
oh , that would be monica .
can i borrow stuff ? i wanna make aurora breakfast .
you got the whole night ?
well , i only have 20 minutes until ethan , so ....
do i sense resentment ?
no . no resentment . believe me ...
... it &apos;s worth it , okay ?
in a relationship , you have moments you &apos;ll remember the rest of your life .
every single second is like that with aurora .
i &apos;ve just wasted 35 of them talking to you .
so , monica , can you help me with the door ?
the old monica would remind you ...
... to scrub that t eflon pan with a plastic brush .
but l &apos; m not gonna do that .
excuse me ? can they warm it up ? i &apos; m concerned about goose bumps .
everybody ready ?
i wanna thank you for this opportunity .
i mean , i know this is just a first step , but i hope that someday
lose the robe .
right . okay . losing the robe !
okay , and the robe is lost .
i would like to get this in one take .
let &apos;s roll it .
water &apos;s working .
and action !
and cut !
butt guy , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m showering .
no , that was clenching .
the way i see it , the guy &apos;s upset here , you know ?
his wife &apos;s dead , his brother &apos;s missing .
i think his butt would be angry here .
i think his butt would like to get the shot before lunch .
once again , rolling . water working .
and action !
and cut ! what was that ?
i was going for quiet desperation .
but if you have to ask ....
god , i love these fingers .
thank you .
no , actually , i meant my fingers .
look at them . look at how happy they are .
oh , my god , l &apos; m late !
oh , no !
don &apos;t go .
okay .
i have to .
look , she &apos;s leaving .
i &apos; m sorry . he &apos;ll be waiting for me .
i thought you talked to rick .
it &apos;s not rick .
ethan ? he gets the whole day !
no , it &apos;s andrew .
i know there &apos;ll be moments ...
... when i &apos;ll regret asking the following question , but ....
and andrew is ? -he &apos;s ...
... new .
so you &apos; re not completely fulfilled by rick , ethan and myself ?
no , that &apos;s not exactly what i was
most women would kill ...
... for three guys like us .
so , what do you want ?
you .
you have me .
no . just you .
what do you mean ?
lose the other guys .
like , all of them ?
come on , we &apos; re great together . why not ?
can &apos;t we have what we have now ?
why can &apos;t we talk and make love ...
... without feeling obligated to each other ?
up until tonight , i thought that &apos;s what you wanted too .
well , part of me wants that ...
... but it &apos;s like l &apos; m two guys . one guy &apos;s saying , &quot; this is great ! &quot;
but there &apos;s this other guy .
the guy who wells up when the grinch &apos;s heart grows ...
... and breaks that measuring device .
he &apos;s saying , you know , &quot; this is too hard . get out ! &quot;
so , which one of the guys will you listen to ?
i have to listen to both . they don &apos;t let each other finish .
which one ?
the second guy .
i see .
call me if you change your mind .
sorry , the first guy runs the lips .
look at it this way . you dumped her !
right ? i mean , this woman was unbelievably sexy ...
... and beautiful , intelligent , unattainable .
tell me why you did this again ?
movie star !
wait ! aren &apos;t you the guy who plays the butt in the new pacino movie ?
nope .
no ? what happened , big guy ?
big guy ?
it felt like a &quot; big guy &quot; moment .
i got fired !
they said i acted too much with it .
i told everybody about this !
everybody &apos;s expecting to see me .
lknow what ?
no one will be able to tell .
my mom will .
there &apos;s something so sweet and disturbing about that .
i &apos;ve done crappy plays for six years ...
... and i finally get my shot , and i blow it !
maybe this wasn &apos;t it .
i think when it &apos;s your shot , you know it &apos;s your shot .
did it feel like your shot ?
hard to tell . i was naked .
i don &apos;t think this was it . i don &apos;t think you just get one .
i believe things are gonna happen for you . i do .
you &apos;ve got to think about the day some kid will go :
&quot; l got the part ! i &apos;m gonna be joey t ribbiani &apos;s ass ! &quot;
you think ? that &apos;s so nice .
i &apos; m sorry , joey . i &apos; m gonna go to bed , guys .
good night .
good night .
you &apos; re gonna leave your shoes out here ?
really ? just casually strewn about ...
... in that reckless , haphazard manner ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;ll get them tomorrow . or not !
whenever .
she is a kook .
if it bothers you that much , just go out and get the shoes .
no , don &apos; t do this !
this is stupid !
i don &apos; t have to prove anything . i &apos;m gonna get them .
but then everyone will know .
unless i get them , then wake up really early and put them back .
i need help !
all you want is a dinkle
not that song !
all you envy &apos;s a schwang
come on , you guys .
a thing through which you can tinkle
or play with or simply let hang
all you want is a dinkle
what you envy &apos;s a schwang
a thing through which you can tinkle
