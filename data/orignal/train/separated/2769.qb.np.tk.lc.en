career .
you don &apos;t have to worry about me . i &apos;m doing fine .
i &apos;m afraid this has been denied .
that &apos;s impossible .
that &apos;s all right , dear . here you go .
the one with the fake monica
how &apos;d someone get your card number ?
no idea . look how much they spent .
you only have to pay for the stuff you bought .
still , it &apos;s just such reckless spending .
when somebody steals ...
... they &apos;ve already thrown caution to the wind .
wow , what a geek . they spent $ 69 . 95 on a wonder mop .
that &apos;s me .
you see , when i say geek , i mean
the hell with it , you bought a $ 70 mop , you &apos;re a geek .
oh , yuck . ross , he &apos;s doing it again .
marcel , stop humping the lamp .
stop humping . now , marcel , come come here , marcel .
oh , no . not in my room . i &apos;ll get him .
you &apos;ve got to do something about that .
what ? it &apos;s just a phase .
well , that &apos;s what we said about joey .
you &apos;d think you would be more understanding .
i know . but we &apos;re not .
would you all relax ? it &apos;s not that big a deal .
marcel , stop it . marcel . bad monkey .
what ?
let &apos;s say my curious george is no longer curious .
you are not still going over that thing .
this woman &apos;s living my life .
what ?
she &apos;s living my life , and she &apos;s doing it better than me .
look at this . look . she buys tickets to plays i wanna see .
she shops where i &apos;m afraid of the salespeople .
she spent $ 300 on art supplies .
you &apos;re not an artist .
i might be if i had the supplies .
i mean , i could do all this stuff . only i don &apos;t .
oh , monica , come on . you do cool things .
really ? let &apos;s compare , shall we ?
oh , it &apos;s so late for &quot; shall we . &quot;
do i horseback ride in the park ?
do i take classes at the new school ?
no .
she &apos;s got everything i want , and she doesn &apos;t have my mother .
how about joey paponi ?
no , still too ethnic .
my agent wants a more neutral name .
joey switzerland ?
plus , i think it should be joe . joey makes me sound like i &apos;m this big :
which i &apos;m not .
joe , joe , joe stalin ?
stalin .
do i know that name ? it sounds familiar .
well , it does not ring a bell with me .
but you &apos;re more plugged into that show business thing .
joe stalin .
you know , that &apos;s pretty good .
you might wanna try joseph .
joseph stalin .
i think you &apos;d remember that .
yes .
bye bye birdie , starring joseph stalin .
joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof .
hi . yes , this is monica geller .
i &apos;m taking some classes with you , and i was wondering what they were .
i &apos;ve had a recent head injury and certain numbers
barbecue . oh , did l ? see , there you go .
what are you doing ?
all right , great .
great . thanks a lot . i &apos;m going to tap class .
to dance with the woman that stole your card ?
to see what she looks like .
i &apos;m sure her picture &apos;s up at the post office .
i should get to see who she is .
you &apos;re kind of losing it here . this is becoming a weird obsession .
this is madness , i tell you .
for the love of god , monica , don &apos;t do it .
thank you .
what do you think ?
lots of things .
which one is she ?
may i help you ?
no , thanks . we &apos;re just here to observe .
you don &apos;t observe a dance class . you dance a dance class .
spare shoes are over there .
what does she mean ?
i think she means &quot; you dance a dance class . &quot;
come on , come on , come on .
really ?
do you see anybody you think could be me ?
last time there were yogurt containers lying around after class .
let &apos;s not have that happen again .
she could be you .
let &apos;s get started .
five , six . five , six , seven , eight .
okay , i &apos;m not getting this .
i &apos;m totally getting it .
do you ever feel like you &apos;re so uncoordinated ?
what ? you click when they click .
all right , everyone grab a partner .
all right . and my dead mother said you are it . i &apos;m with rachel .
great , it &apos;s gym class all over again .
you can come up to the front and dance with me .
why don &apos;t i just take off my clothes and have a nightmare ?
it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m here , i &apos;m here . i &apos;m so sorry i &apos;m late .
okay , here i am . so who &apos;s the new tense girl ?
she &apos;s your partner .
hi , i &apos;m monica .
oh , monica .
hi , i &apos;m mon
nana .
monana .
it &apos;s dutch .
you &apos;re kidding .
i spent three years in amsterdam .
pennsylvania dutch .
and we &apos;re dancing . five , six , seven , eight .
hi .
hey . where have you been ?
i just got back from the vet .
she &apos;s not gonna make you wear a big plastic cone ?
she says marcel &apos;s humping is not a phase .
apparently , he &apos;s reached sexual maturity .
hey , he beat you .
she says , as time goes on , he &apos;s gonna start getting violent .
so , what does this mean ?
i have to give him up .
i can &apos;t believe it . this sucks .
you just got him . how could he be an adult already ?
i know . one day he &apos;s this little thing ...
... and then he &apos;s this little thing i can &apos;t get off my leg .
isn &apos;t there any way to keep him ?
no . the vet said unless he &apos;s in a place ...
... where he has regular access ...
... to some monkey loving ...
... he &apos;s just gonna get vicious .
i just gotta get him into a zoo .
how do you get a monkey into a zoo ?
i know .
no , that &apos;s popes into a vokswagen .
we &apos;re applying to a lot . our first choice would be a big state zoo .
you know , like san diego . right ?
but that may just be a pipe dream . he &apos;s out @-@ of @-@ state .
my vet knows someone at miami , so that &apos;s a possibility .
but that &apos;s two blocks from the beach . it &apos;s a total party zoo .
we found the girl .
did you call the cops ?
we took her to lunch .
oh , your own brand of vigilante justice .
are you insane ? this woman stole from you .
she stole . she &apos;s a stealer .
after you &apos;re with this woman for 10 minutes , you forget that .
i mean , she &apos;s this astounding person with this amazing spirit .
which she probably stole from some cheerleader .
take off their hats .
popes in a vokswagen .
i love that joke .
no way . no way did you do this .
monana was very brave .
we told them we were the gundersons in room 61.5 ...
... only to find out the boston celtics had the entire floor .
when they saw that we &apos;re short and have breasts ....
they threw us out . i was thrown out of a hotel . me .
go , monana .
you ladies are not the only ones living the dream .
i get to go pour coffee for people i don &apos;t know . don &apos;t wait up .
oh , by the way ...
... tomorrow we &apos;re auditioning for a broadway show .
excuse me ?
there &apos;s an open call for cats .
i &apos;m thinking we sing &quot; memories ... &quot;
... and make complete fools of ourselves . what do you say ?
no , no , no . remember who you &apos;re dealing with here .
i can &apos;t even stand in front of a tap class .
that &apos;s because of your amish background .
what ?
you &apos;re pennsylvania dutch , right ?
right . till i bought a blow dryer . then i was shunned .
i was just like you . and then , one day , i saw a movie that changed my life .
did you ever see dead poets society ?
i thought that movie was so incredibly boring .
that thing at the end where the kid ...
... kills himself because he can &apos;t be in the play ?
it &apos;s like , &quot; kid , wait a year . leave home , do some community theater . &quot;
i thought , &quot; that &apos;s two hours of my life that i &apos;m never getting back . &quot;
that scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do .
wow . then i would definitely not recommend mrs. doubtfire .
oh , god .
we didn &apos;t get into scranton .
that was , like , our safety zoo .
they take , like , dogs and cows .
see , i don &apos;t know who this is harder on , me or him .
i &apos;d say that chair &apos;s taking the brunt of it .
marcel . marcel . marcel , no .
good boy . see ? how can nobody want him ?
somebody will .
you know , there already is a joseph stalin .
you &apos;re kidding .
apparently , he was this russian dictator who slaughtered people .
you &apos;d think you would &apos;ve known that .
you &apos;d think i would &apos;ve .
hey , how about joey heatherton ?
come on , i told you i don &apos;t wanna go back to joey .
what do you think a good stage name for me would be ?
flame boy .
where exactly is your zoo ?
well , it &apos;s technically not a zoo , per se .
it &apos;s more of an interactive wildlife experience .
let me ask you some questions about marcel .
does he fight with other animals ?
no , no . he &apos;s very docile .
even if he were cornered ?
well , i don &apos;t know . why ?
how is he at handling small objects ?
he can hold a banana , if that &apos;s what you mean .
what about a hammer or a small blade ?
why would he need a blade ?
if he &apos;s up against an animal with horns ...
... you got to give him something .
otherwise , it &apos;s just cruel .
he got into san diego .
what ?
we came back from our walk . the phone was ringing ....
he &apos;s in .
did you hear that , marcel ? san diego . san diego .
you &apos;re making a mistake . san diego &apos;s good ...
... but i &apos;ll start him off against a blind rabbit ...
... and give you 20 % of the gate .
where have you been ?
monica and i just crashed an embassy party .
i think i kissed an archbishop .
but , of course , it could &apos;ve been a chef .
are you drunk ?
no .
i &apos;m lying . i am so drunk .
oh , god .
you know what ? you could &apos;ve called .
i &apos;ve been worried monica .
water rules .
yes . yes , it does .
the restaurant called . they wanna know if you &apos;re showing up for work .
nope . going to the big apple circus today .
you &apos;re gonna lose your job . this is not you .
no , it is me .
i &apos;m not just the person who fluffs the pillows ...
... and pays the bills right away .
you know , when i &apos;m with her , i &apos;m so much more than that .
i &apos;m monana .
hello ? yes , she is . hold on a second please .
monana , it &apos;s for you . the credit card people .
hello .
yes ?
oh , my god .
thanks .
what ?
they &apos;ve arrested monica .
hi .
hi .
how are you ?
not too bad . fortunately , blue &apos;s my color .
how did you know i was here ?
because i &apos;m monica geller .
it was my credit card you were using .
that i was not expecting .
i want you to know , i didn &apos;t turn you in .
thanks .
no , thank you .
you have given me so much .
i &apos;d never have gotten to sing ...
... &quot; memories &quot; at the winter garden theater .
actually , you only got to sing &quot; memo &quot;
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here . what will i do without you ?
who &apos;s gonna crash parties with me ?
who &apos;s gonna take me to the big apple circus ?
i started my day by peeing in front of 25 other women ...
... and you &apos;re worried about who &apos;ll take you to the circus ?
well , not worried , you know , just wondering .
there &apos;s nothing to wonder about .
you &apos;ll go back to being who you were . that &apos;s who you are .
not necessarily .
yes , necessarily .
i don &apos;t know what it is . maybe it &apos;s the amish thing .
i &apos;m not actually amish .
really ? then why are you like that ?
you , by the door , in or out ?
ln .
you &apos;re getting it all wrong .
but at least i &apos;m doing it .
this is the final boarding call for flight 67 ...
... to san diego at gate 42a .
okay , goodbye , little monkey guy . all right , i wrote you this poem .
okay , but don &apos;t eat it till you get on the plane .
thank you , aunt phoebe .
okay , bye , champ .
there &apos;ll be a lot of babes in san diego ...
... but remember , there &apos;s also a lot to learn .
i don &apos;t know what to say , ross . it &apos;s a monkey .
just say what you feel , joey .
marcel , i &apos;m hungry .
that was good .
marcel , this is for you .
it &apos;s just , you know , something ...
... to do on the plane .
if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d like a moment alone .
oh , sure . absolutely .
go ahead .
marcel , come here . come here . come here .
well , buddy ...
... this is it .
just a couple of things i wanted to say .
i &apos;m really gonna miss you .
you know , i &apos;m never gonna forget about you .
you &apos;ve been more than just a pet to me .
you &apos;ve been more like a okay . marcel .
would you leave my leg alone ?
would you stop humping me for two seconds ?
okay , would you just take him away ? just take him .
oh , that i were a glove upon that hand ...
... that i might touch thy cheek .
that &apos;s fine . thank you .
next .
i &apos;ll be reading for the role of mercutio .
