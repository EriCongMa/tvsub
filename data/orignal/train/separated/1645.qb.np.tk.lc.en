okay ...
the x @-@ tens are online .
gentlemen , i am now about send a signal
from this laptop through our local isp
racing down fiber @-@ optic cable at the speed of light
to san francisco , bouncing off a satellite
in geosynchronous orbit to lisbon , portugal ,
where the data packets
will be handed off to submerged trans @-@ atlantic cables
terminating in halifax , nova scotia
and transferred across the continent
via microwave relays back to our isp
and the x @-@ ten receiver attached to this ...
lamp .
look at me. look at me . i &apos;ve got goose bumps .
are we ready on the stereo ?
go for stereo .
hey , guys .
hi. hello. hello .
it &apos;s a little loud .
no problem-- turning it down .
san francisco , lisbon , halifax ...
and voila .
okay , thanks .
hang on , hang on. do you not realize what we just did ?
yeah , you turned your stereo down with you laptop .
no , we turned our stereo down by sending a snall
around the world via the internet .
you know , you can just get one of those universal remotes
at radio shack. they &apos;re really cheap .
no , no . you don &apos;t get it .
howard , enable public access .
public access enabled .
boy , that &apos;s terrific . i &apos;ll see ya .
no , hang on , hang on .
see ?
no .
someone in szechwan province , china
is using his computer
to turn our lights on and off .
well , that &apos;s handy .
here is the question . why ?
because we can .
they found the remote @-@ control cars .
well , wait , wait , what &apos;s on top of that ?
wireless web cams. wave hello .
the monster truck is out of austin , texas ,
and the blue viper is being operated
from suburban tel aviv .
you may want to put on slacks .
what ?
ew , stop it .
no leave me alone
who &apos;s running the red corvette ?
that would be me .
the big bang theory s01 e09
you know , in the future
when we &apos;re disembodied brains in jars ,
we &apos;re going to look back at this as eight hours well wasted .
i don &apos;t want to be in a jar .
i want my brain in an android body .
eight feet tall and ripped .
i &apos;m with you .
i just have to make sure that if i &apos;m a synthetic human ,
i &apos;d still be jewish .
i promised my mother .
i suppose you could have your android penis circumcised ,
but that &apos;s something
your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer .
not to mention you &apos;d have to power down on saturdays .
sheldon , why is this letter in the trash ?
well , there &apos;s always the possibility that a trash can
spontaneously formed around the letter ,
but occam &apos;s razor
would suggest that someone threw it out .
it &apos;s from the institute for experimental physics .
they want us to present our paper
on the properties of supersolids
at the topical conference on bose einstein condensates .
i know , i read it before i threw it out .
okay , if i may drill down to the bedrock of my question
why did you throw it out ?
because i have no interest in standing in the rose room
of the pasadena marriott
in front of a group of judgmental strangers
who wouldn &apos;t recognize true genius
if it was standing in front of them giving a speech .
which , if i were there , it would be .
i don &apos;t know , sheldon .
those topical conference on bose einstein condensates
parties are legendary .
forget the parties .
forget the parties ? what a nerd .
are there any other honors i &apos;ve gotten that i don &apos;t know about ?
did ups drop off a nobel prize
with my name on it ?
leonard , please don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but the day you win a nobel prize
is the day i begin my research
on the drag coefficient of tassels on flying carpets .
ooh , the only thing missing
from that insult was &quot; your mama . &quot;
i got one .
hey , leonard , your mama &apos;s research methodology is so flawed ...
shut up , howard .
sheldon , we have to do this .
no , we don &apos;t .
we have to take in nourishment , expel waste ,
and inhale enough oxygen to keep our cells from dying .
everything else is optional .
okay , let me put it this way , i &apos;m doing it .
you can &apos;t . i &apos;m the lead author .
come on , the only reason you &apos;re the lead author
is because we went alphabetically .
i let you think we went alphabetically
to spare you the humiliation
of dealing with the fact that it was my idea .
not to put too fine a point on it ,
but i was throwing you a bone .
you &apos;re welcome .
excuse me , i designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis .
it doesn &apos;t need proving .
so the entire scientific community
is just supposed to take your word ?
they &apos;re not supposed to , but they should .
all right , i don &apos;t care what you say ,
i &apos;m going to the conference and i &apos;m presenting our findings .
and i forbid it .
you forbid it ?
if i &apos;m not taking credit for our work , then nobody is .
so you admit that it &apos;s our work ? no .
once again , i &apos;m throwing you a bone .
and once again you are welcome .
oh , no , he didn &apos;t
so , how &apos;s it going with sheldon ?
are you guys still not talking to each other ?
not only is he still not talking to me ,
but there &apos;s this thing he does where he stares at you
and tries to get your brain to explode .
you know , like in the classic sci @-@ fi movie scanners .
like ... bzzz ...
never mind .
how about this one ?
it says , i know my physics , but i &apos;m still a fun guy .
wow , i didn &apos;t know they still made corduroy suits .
they don &apos;t.that &apos;s why i saved this one .
okay , well , let &apos;s just see
what else you have .
okay , here , take this ...
and this , and this , and these ...
is this all stuff you want me to try on ?
no , this is stuff i want you to throw out .
oh. seriously , don &apos;t even give them to charity .
you won &apos;t be helping anyone .
what &apos;s this ?
that &apos;s the bottle city of kandor .
you see , kandor was the capital city
of the planet krypton .
it was miniaturized by brainiac before krypton exploded ,
and then rescued by superman .
oh. nice .
it &apos;s a lot cooler when girls aren &apos;t looking at it .
here , why don &apos;t you put these on
while i find a shirt and a sport coat that match .
great , i &apos;ll be right back .
where are you going ? just put &apos; em on .
here ?
oh , are you shy ?
no , i &apos;m not shy .
don &apos;t worry . i won &apos;t look .
i know you won &apos;t look. why would you look ?
there &apos;s nothing to see ... well , not nothing ...
sweetie , put the pants on .
putting &apos; em on .
so , you know , isn &apos;t there maybe some way
you and sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing ?
no , no .
scientists do not compromise .
our minds are trained to synthesize facts
and come to inarguable conclusions .
not to mention , sheldon is bat @-@ crap crazy .
what is this ?
oh , careful .
that &apos;s my original series
battlestar galactica flight suit .
oh , why didn &apos;t you wear it on halloween ?
because it &apos;s not a costume. it &apos;s a flight suit .
okay , all right , moving on .
oh , wow , a paisley shirt .
uh @-@ huh , it goes with my corduroy suit .
if you mean they should end up in the same place , then i agree .
is this your only tie ?
technically , yes .
but if you &apos;ll notice ...
it &apos;s reversible .
so it works as two .
oh sweetie , i don &apos;t even think it works as one .
is this all your clothes ?
yup. everything since the eighth grade .
the ... the eighth grade ?
my last growth spurt .
okay , well , i guess we &apos;re back to the corduroy suit .
great. yep .
i said no. put it down .
hey , sheldon .
hello , penny .
get anything good ?
just the latest copy of applied particle physics quarterly .
oh , you know , that is so weird that yours came and mine didn &apos;t .
it was a joke .
yep , tip your waitresses .
i &apos;m here all week .
penny , just to save you from further awkwardness ,
know that i &apos;m perfectly comfortable with the two of us
climbing the stairs in silence .
oh , yeah , okay , me , too .
zip it , lock it .
put it in your pocket .
so , you and leonard .
oh , dear god .
a little misunderstanding , huh ?
a little misundersta ... ?
galileo and the pope had a little misunderstanding .
anyway , i was talking to leonard this morning ,
and i think he feels really bad about it .
well , how do you feel ?
i don &apos;t understand the question .
no , i &apos;m just asking if it &apos;s difficult
to be fighting with your best friend .
oh , i hadn &apos;t thought about it like that .
i wonder if i &apos;ve been experiencing
physiological manifestations
of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil .
wait. what ?
i couldn &apos;t poop this morning .
just talk to him .
i &apos;m sure you guys can work this out .
it &apos;s certainly preferable to my plan .
which was ?
a powerful laxative .
okay , so you absolutely should talk to him .
look , i know leonard values you as a friend ,
and he told me himself that without your little idea ,
there &apos;s no way he could have
come up with this whole experiment thing .
excuse me . &quot; little idea &quot; ?
yeah , i mean , he tried to explain it to me .
i didn &apos;t really understand it ...
of course , you didn &apos;t .
he said , &quot; little idea &quot; ?
well , no , not in ... not in those words .
in what words then , exactly ?
um , you know , gee , the exact words ...
it &apos;s more the spirit in which ...
what did he say ?
you had a lucky hunch .
hey , sheldon , i &apos;ve been thinking .
instead of arguing about this ...
don &apos;t you ever speak to me again .
wha ... ?
he ...
okay , i &apos;m leaving for the conference .
have fun presenting my &quot; lucky hunch . &quot;
shel , i didn &apos;t mean it like that .
then why did you say it ?
i don &apos;t know . i wasn &apos;t ...
were you trying to impress penny ?
no , no , not at all. a little bit .
how &apos;d that work out for you ?
leonard , ready to go ?
libido 1.0 .
okay , i &apos;m gonna ask you one more time .
we did the work together .
let &apos;s present the paper together .
and i &apos;m telling you for the last time
it &apos;s pandering , it &apos;s undignified , and bite me .
let &apos;s go .
bye , sheldon .
good @-@ bye , penny .
one of these days ...
there you go .
you &apos;re right. this side does look better .
no , no , i didn &apos;t say &quot; better . &quot;
i said &quot; less stained . &quot;
i just checked the house. there &apos;s probably
20 @-@ 25 people in there .
you &apos;re kidding ?
is that all ? &quot; all &quot; ?
in particle physics , 25 is woodstock .
oh , well , then good .
i wasn &apos;t expecting such a crowd . i &apos;m a little nervous .
it &apos;s okay. just open with a joke. you &apos;ll be fine .
uh , joke. okay ,
how about this ?
um , okay , uh , there &apos;s this farmer ,
and he has these chickens ,
but they won &apos;t lay any eggs , so he calls a physicist to help .
the physicist then does some calculations ,
and he says , &quot; i have a solution ,
but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum . &quot;
right ?
oh , sorry , i just ... i &apos;ve heard it before .
let &apos;s roll. okay .
hey , nice suit .
it &apos;s a classic , right ?
i really should have brought my own car .
so , in conclusion , the data show
that at temperatures approaching absolute zero ,
the moment of inertia changes ,
and the solid becomes a supersolid which clearly appears
to be a previously unknown state of matter .
thank you .
were there any questions ?
yeah , what the hell was that ?
any other questions ?
dr. sheldon cooper here .
i am the lead author of this particular paper .
thank you .
and you , sir , you have completely skipped over the part
where i was walking through the park ,
and i saw these children on a merry @-@ go @-@ round ,
which started me thinking about the moment of inertia
in gases like helium
at temperatures approaching absolute zero .
i didn &apos;t skip it. it &apos;s just an anecdote .
it &apos;s not science .
oh , i see .
was the apple falling on newton &apos;s head ,
was that just an anecdote ?
you are not isaac newton .
no , no , that &apos;s true .
gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple .
you could not possibly be that arrogant .
you continue to underestimate me , my good man .
look , if you weren &apos;t happy with my presentation ,
then maybe you should have given it with me .
as i &apos;ve explained repeatedly , unlike you ,
i don &apos;t need validation from lesser minds .
no offense .
so why did you come ?
because i knew you &apos;d screw this up .
i didn &apos;t screw it up
oh , please ,
i admit that spherical chicken joke-- that was hilarious . thanks .
but it was straight downhill from there .
i &apos;ve had enough of your condescension .
maybe i didn &apos;t go to college when i was 11 like you .
maybe i got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16,
but you are not the only person
who is smarter than everyone else in this room
no offense .
and i am clearly not the only person
who is tormented by insecurity
and has an ego in need of constant validation .
so you admit that you &apos;re an egotist ?
yes
my name is dr. leonard hofstadter
and i could never please my parents ,
so i need to get all my self @-@ esteem
from strangers like you .
but he &apos;s worse
okay , that is it stop it
you cannot blow up my head with your mind
then i &apos;ll settle for an aneurysm .
stop it
you hit me
you saw that. he hit me .
you were trying to blow up my head .
so it was working .
it was not you are a nut case
we &apos;ll see about that .
heads up , you people in the front row .
this is a splash zone .
stop it
quit it
is this usually how these physics things go ?
more often than you think .
stop it nerve pinch
you could have offered me a ride home .
you &apos;re lucky i didn &apos;t run you over .
i really don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re so unhappy about .
you begged me to come . i came .
there &apos;s just no pleasing you .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m the problem .
i &apos;m the one that needs help .
well , that &apos;s not much of an apology ,
but i &apos;ll take it .
excuse me .
is there anything you would like to apologize for ?
yes .
i &apos;m sorry i tried to blow up your head .
it was uncalled for .
you won &apos;t believe this .
somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone
and put it on youtube .
what ?
now who would do that ?
that would be me .
hey , check it out. it &apos;s a featured video .
you hit me
you saw that he hit me
you &apos;re trying to blow up my head .
so it was working .
stop it you &apos;re a nut case .
we &apos;ll see about that .
you people in the front row , heads up. this is a splash zone .
stop it
quit it quit it
put you in a vulcan nerve pinch
ow , you should cut your fingernails. those hurt
oh , geez , does this suit really look that bad ?
forget your suit .
look at my arms waving .
i &apos;m like a flamingo on ritalin .
howard ,
would you like to explain to me
why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping
on your shoulder captioned &quot; me and my girlfriend &quot; ?
here comes the talk .
somewhere in china
what losers .
yeah . gigantic american geeks .
who &apos;s doing that ?
someone from pasadena , california named ...
&quot; wolowizard &quot;
