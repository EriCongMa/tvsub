taking out the trash ?
last night , lexi and i had sex .
well , we needed the morning @-@ after pill .
so , now what ?
have you thought any more about talking to your mom ?
if she ever found out that you guys gave me the pill ,
she &apos;d go crazy .
i did it so you did not have to .
what is he doing here ?
i invited him .
i don &apos;t want you dating wyatt
because i don &apos;t want you dating anyone .
even having this conversation could
get me and jude kicked out of the house .
that would never happen .
brandon . it can happen ...
i &apos;ll take jude to his tutor , then drop jesus at practice .
mike is taking brandon to his audition while you &apos;re at your dad &apos;s .
how long do you think you &apos;re going to be ?
not long , just enough to stock the fridge , say hello , you know .
good morning , sweets .
good morning .
good morning , sleepy head .
is this thing supposed to itch ?
that &apos;s a excellent question ,
one you should have posed before you stuck a needle in your face .
oh , since you &apos;re going to the store ,
will you pick up a couple bottles of white ?
yeah . what &apos;s wrong with what we have ?
we &apos;re not serving wine in a box .
ok , fancy @-@ pants . but it &apos;s lexi &apos;s parents .
we &apos;re not trying to impress them .
jesus &apos; relentless micromanagement would suggest otherwise ...
speaking of which , you &apos;re still welcome to join us , you know .
i &apos;m sure the riveras would love to see you .
or not .
well , you &apos;re up and at &apos; em this morning .
i got to practice .
you were up practicing pretty late night .
it &apos;s a big day .
he stresses himself out every time he has an audition like this .
i know . he &apos;ll be fine .
brandon wake you up , too ?
he &apos;s supposed to be wearing his headphones .
he is . you can hear him banging on his keyboard through the walls .
it &apos;s like a construction site in there .
oh , everybody &apos;s up . before 10 : 00 .
what kind of teenagers are you ?
not jude .
that kid could sleep through the apocalypse .
did you guys decide what we &apos;re having for dinner ?
yes , as a matter of fact ,
i do believe we &apos;re starting with some caviar ,
then lobster tails with belgian escarole ,
and a side of truffled potatoes ...
seriously ?
no , of course not .
mama &apos;s making halibut .
i just want to impress them .
if we have the caviar to impress them ,
we &apos;re not going to make the cut . what are you so nervous for , anyway ?
this isn &apos;t a sit @-@ down like the godfather .
the riveras just want to be sure
both families are on the same page .
we &apos;ll do our best
to assure them we &apos;re not running a teen brothel ,
but , you know , we &apos;re not going to pretend to be something we aren &apos;t .
i know , they &apos;re just old school .
oh , callie .
are you ok to walk to your support group , tonight ?
um , yeah .
did you take those ?
it &apos;s not like it requires talent .
i just clicked a button .
no , these are great .
is this something you &apos;re into , photography ?
i mean , i guess .
you better run and get a shower before you &apos;re late .
ok .
oh , i almost forgot .
let me guess , you &apos;d like us to use the fine china ?
lexi &apos;s parents are chaperoning a retreat next weekend ,
and i really want to go .
um , hello . we have the adoption fair next weekend .
since when are you religious ?
since when are you a hipster ?
ok . enough .
we &apos;ll not make any promises , jesus , but we &apos;ll ...
we &apos;ll look into it .
you never invited lexi &apos;s parents over
when we were friends .
ok , church camp ?
so , we can subject our son to a bunch of people
who don &apos;t approve of our family ?
um , no .
i figured , hey , it &apos;s still technically still &quot; ours , &quot;
i might as well throw one last party .
you &apos;re not upset the bank &apos;s foreclosing
on the only home you &apos;ve ever lived in ?
that &apos;s like me throwing a party every time
i got yanked out of one foster home and dropped in another .
it &apos;s just a house .
is this really your house ?
&apos;cause , last time we went to your house ,
i almost got arrested . so ...
come see .
how hard is it to sneak into a place with a marker ?
look .
you did this ?
yeah , when i was little .
i started in fourth grade .
when life sucked i &apos;d go in there and just ... draw .
this is stupid ...
no , it &apos;s not stupid .
i want to see more .
you want to see more of me ?
oh , you &apos;re really incapable of being serious for more than 30 seconds , aren &apos;t you ?
do you want me to be serious ?
let &apos;s talk about us . what are we ?
are we dating ? what do you call this thing that we &apos;re doing ?
i do not get you .
i feel like i &apos;m a girl in this relationship .
relationship ?
if you could only see how ridiculous you look right now .
come tonight .
no ...
i want you at my party .
no way . wyatt , i &apos;m on probation .
one close call is enough for me .
it &apos;s just a little get together .
sorry , i have to go .
got a hot date ?
yeah .
with a bunch of angry foster kids .
why don &apos;t you blow it off ?
it &apos;s required . bye .
very nice .
oh , sorry . was it too loud ?
i took my headphones off , my ears were hurting .
no , no , no . it was beautiful .
well ... we &apos;ll see .
i just wanted to wish you luck before i head out .
we won &apos;t be back
before your dad comes to pick you up this afternoon .
you need anything ?
um , i &apos;m good . thanks .
i have all the confidence in the world
that you &apos;re going to impress this guy ,
but this audition can &apos;t be the be @-@ all , end @-@ all of your life .
he &apos;s just a piano teacher .
no . no , he &apos;s not . he &apos;s one of the best in the state .
well , he &apos;d be lucky to have you .
he didn &apos;t exactly feel that way last year or the year before that .
we &apos;re proud of you . no matter what .
whoa , where are you headed in such a hurry ?
garret invited me to lunch .
you two are spending quite a bit of time together these days .
can i go ? we were just going to meet at paco &apos;s .
sure , i was just about to leave , i can drop you off .
ok . but , can we hurry ? i don &apos;t want to be late .
sounds like you dealt with that really well , nicole .
thank you .
sarah , we haven &apos;t heard from you yet .
well , um ...
after a few misses ,
i think my third foster home &apos;s a match .
the olmsteads have really gone out of their way to make me feel welcome .
they don &apos;t introduce me as their &quot; foster daughter , &quot;
and they take me everywhere .
it &apos;s nice to feel like i belong . even if it is temporary .
and we lived happily ever after .
ok . thanks for that , sarah .
it &apos;s time to break ,
but i hope next week we &apos;ll all participate .
such a waste , right ?
oh . yeah .
i can &apos;t believe they make us do this crap on a saturday .
i know , right ?
hey , um ...
do you want to talk about it over coffee or something ?
my treat .
yeah .
yeah , just let me text my foster mom .
yeah .
you came .
wow . your folks must be mad , huh ?
well , they &apos;re not exactly happy .
i like it .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;d rather be hanging with your friends
on a saturday afternoon , so thank you for coming .
well , my weekends are pretty boring these days .
don &apos;t you have a boyfriend ?
pretty girl like you .
and where are your girls ?
i remember when i was your age ,
i would not go anywhere without my girl nati .
well , my nati &apos;s name is lexi and
we aren &apos;t talking .
what &apos;d she do ?
it &apos;s complicated .
try me .
she &apos;s been hooking up with jesus behind my back .
oh , man . yeah , that sucks .
i was surprised to hear from you again .
last time , you ...
you know , took off so fast .
yeah .
well , this is awkward .
i don &apos;t have anymore money , if that &apos;s what you mean .
oh , no . no , god , no .
i was thinking about you on your birthday ...
wishing i was there .
wondering if you even got to have a quinceanera .
i did , yeah .
that &apos;s so nice .
i bet it was wonderful .
oh , yeah .
it was amazing .
well , i wish i could &apos;ve seen it .
anyway ...
i wanted to give you something .
my god , thank you .
do you like it ?
i love it .
dad , you were supposed to be here 20 minutes ago !
i &apos;m going to miss this audition , where are you ?
hi dad !
there &apos;s my favorite daughter .
your only daughter .
but i &apos;m relieved i made the list .
here , let me help you .
i got it .
i &apos;m not an invalid .
you don &apos;t have to keep doing this , you know .
if i don &apos;t stock the fridge , dad ,
you &apos;ll live on sodium @-@ packed tv dinners .
it &apos;s bad for your heart .
come on , you &apos;re nuts .
your mother and i raised you on tv dinners .
and i still have nightmares
about frozen peas and salisbury steak .
spoke to mom last night , by the way .
she sends her regards from florida .
good for her .
see the padres game last night ?
you mean the massacre ? barely heard the last inning .
jesus was screaming at the tv .
you got to love that kid .
you know , i really should take him to a game
since baseball isn &apos;t brandon &apos;s thing .
you know , they would both love an invite , dad .
just not next weekend .
jesus wants to go to a bible camp .
come again ?
your grandson wants to go to a church camp . catholic church camp .
catholic ?
you &apos;re not raising the kids catholic , are you ?
please , dad . you know we don &apos;t do church .
don &apos;t you think they need a church though ?
a good christian church ?
i never understood why you stopped .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
what ?
well , you never understood why i stopped ?
i know you remember tess , tess brown , my friend from high school ?
yeah . her .
her . you sent me to see a youth minister
because you caught us &quot; cuddling &quot; on the couch .
even though we weren &apos;t doing anything .
was only trying to help .
how ? you never talked to me about it .
you never asked me anything .
all you did was lock me in a room with some man ,
who proceeded to tell me that being gay was a sin .
i was being a parent , i was pushing you in the right direction .
well , i was completely humiliated .
so that &apos;s why you stopped going to church ?
one meeting 20 years ago ?
how could i ever go back , dad ?
i didn &apos;t want you to make wrong choices .
i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m just saying !
you had a husband , and a son .
and you still left mike for lena .
you had everything , and made the choice to be gay .
it &apos;s not a ... i ...
oh , my god .
ok , let &apos;s pretend it is a choice , dad .
at the end of the day ,
who i love shouldn &apos;t be an issue for you , or anyone else .
i have an amazing family . lena is an amazing woman ,
whom i absolutely adore .
so , yeah . i made a choice .
i made a choice to be happy , dad .
i don &apos;t want to get into this right now .
you &apos;re welcome for the groceries , dad .
sorry , i fell asleep watching the game .
yeah , well , it &apos;s the middle of the freaking day .
i said i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , i heard you .
i get my own room .
you &apos;re lucky .
when i first moved in to my new house ,
my roommate totally hated me .
she come around ?
yeah .
i mean we &apos;d probably never hang out ,
if we weren &apos;t forced to live under the same roof .
but , yeah , as far as foster siblings go , i guess she &apos;s cool .
so what about you ? is there any other kids at the olmsteads ?
one . he &apos;s older , he &apos;s out of high school ,
but he still lives at home .
that &apos;s cute . here , give me your instagram handle and i &apos;ll tag you .
so , this boy . is he cute ?
do you hang out ? what do you do ?
jeez , you ask a lot of questions .
sorry . i live with four other kids , so ...
well , he and his dad like golf .
like , a lot . like , obsessed .
one time we went mini @-@ golfing , you know , as a family ,
and he got so pissed
when he missed this easy putt that he broke his club .
like , in half !
wait , who ? liam or his dad ?
i never said his name was liam .
you sure ?
i &apos;m pretty sure you did .
no , um ...
i &apos;ve got to go .
looks like you &apos;re having a rockin &apos; saturday .
the sunset looks cool behind your elm tree . look .
pretty .
it &apos;s kind of your tree , too , you know ?
i never really noticed , but wyatt &apos;s super cute .
you think ?
he &apos;s sexy . like , messy @-@ sexy .
ok .
so , what &apos;s up with you two anyway ?
don &apos;t most girls with boyfriends consider saturday date night ?
not my boyfriend . and even if he was ,
he &apos;s having a party tonight , so ...
ok , excuse me ? he &apos;s having a party tonight ,
and we &apos;re sitting here ?
we have to go .
ok , it &apos;s not like you &apos;re missing prom or anything .
it &apos;s just a stupid foreclosure party .
i don &apos;t want to be home
when lexi and her parents get here , please ...
and admit it , you don &apos;t want
to be stuck here on a saturday night either .
and you totally like wyatt .
fine . ok .
if you really want to go .
yay !
don &apos;t force it .
it &apos;s stuck , can you hold on ...
there we go . ok . sorry .
it &apos;s just a dinner party , babe .
it &apos;s not dinner , it &apos;s my dad . he just ...
i don &apos;t know , maybe it is the dinner .
what , we &apos;re supposed to sit there and make nice with these people
who are trying to &quot; save &quot; jesus or something ?
jesus isn &apos;t looking for a religious experience ,
he wants to spend the weekend with his girlfriend .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;d rather be going to disneyland .
but before you jump to any conclusions ,
let &apos;s talk it over with the riveras , ok ?
i &apos;m telling you this , i will not be judged in my own house .
you know what ? we owe it to jesus
to at least find out more about the camp before we shut it down .
they probably think we &apos;re a couple of heathens
who let our children run amuck without any supervision .
if the riveras had any problems with us
they wouldn &apos;t have allowed
lexi to sleep over with mariana all the time .
and lexi and jesus did have sex .
not in the house .
save some for the riveras , please .
whatever you &apos;re cooking smells amazing .
mama &apos;s cooking halibut and grilled asparagus .
mm ...
still time for you to join us .
actually , we were thinking about
getting out of the house and watching a movie at wyatt &apos;s .
the hair model ? oh , we like him .
both of you ?
mm @-@ hmm .
together ?
yes .
wyatt &apos;s parents going to be there ?
um , hello ?
it &apos;s wyatt &apos;s parents &apos; house ?
ok , the two of you may go . be home by 10 : 00 , please .
call if you need a ride .
have fun .
what ? i didn &apos;t lie .
i &apos;m sorry he made you wait and audition last ,
but you &apos;re going to blow him away i know it .
ok , dad . all right .
no , i &apos;m serious .
you &apos;re going to make him forget anyone else played today .
dad , seriously .
sorry .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s more nervous , me or you .
all right , i &apos;m going to take a walk , dad .
thank you very much .
brandon foster ?
good luck , buddy .
作者 claude debussy
um , i &apos;m sorry . can i start again ?
演唱者 the centerfolds
oh , my god . we should go .
oh , hells no .
mariana .
ok , look , if you &apos;re going to drink ...
just have one and sip it all night .
god , don &apos;t worry .
you act like i &apos;ve never been to a party before .
hey , girl !
演唱者 the so so glos
wyatt .
hey , you made it !
yeah , mariana needed a babysitter , so ...
oh , way to make a boy feel special .
guess i &apos;m stoked you came at all .
want a spray can , marker , glow @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark paint pen ?
thought you were just having a little get together ?
is that not what this is ?
what exactly are you
trying to accomplish by destroying your house ?
i am giving the bank a remodel . free of charge .
everyone &apos;s destroying the house you lived in
your whole life and you don &apos;t even care ?
don &apos;t tell me what i care about .
i &apos;m just ...
you know what ?
have fun babysitting .
i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d run into you here ,
especially with juvie girl , but ... yay !
her name &apos;s callie and she &apos;s fine .
ok , what did i miss ?
a lot .
wow . looks like rehab really did the trick .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be , you know , sober ?
hello , i went to rehab for pills , not beer .
and obviously , my parents overreacted .
obviously .
cheers .
well , it &apos;s delicious .
thank you .
thank you for having us .
absolutely .
when lexi asked for our permission to date jesus ,
you can imagine our hesitation .
well , she &apos;s 15 now ,
and if she wants to start dating ,
that &apos;s fine , but we do have concerns .
but if she &apos;s going to keep spending time here ,
not as mariana &apos;s friend ,
but as jesus &apos; girlfriend , we need to set some rules .
we agree . boundaries are essential ,
and curfews , no closed doors ...
how about supervised visits only ?
mami .
meaning ...
if lexi and jesus start spending time together ,
it &apos;ll be in a common area
where siblings or parents will be present .
we want you to feel comfortable having her here ,
and we love lexi like she was our own ...
but we don &apos;t want our kids to feel like
we &apos;re breathing down their necks .
well , that &apos;s exactly what we want .
she &apos;s joking .
yes .
well , a little .
we aren &apos;t sure how we feel about lexi
spending the night with mariana anymore .
um , excuse me . i &apos;ll get it , hon .
sorry for the interruption .
more wine anyone ?
fill &apos; er up .
he &apos;s kidding .
um ... honey , look who &apos;s here .
i , i didn &apos;t realize you had company . hello .
dad .
uh , ernie and sonia rivera , this is my dad , frank .
hi , how do you do ?
great to meet you .
nice to meet you . pleasure .
nice to meet you , too .
hey , gramps .
how are you , kiddo ?
what &apos;s up , dad ?
you know what ? i &apos;m going to go .
we were just about to start . would you like to join us ?
sure , ok . love to .
i &apos;ll go get another plate .
been looking for you . how &apos;d it go ?
can we go ?
no , not until you tell me how it went .
you were late .
brandon , i &apos;m sorry .
and you stink like booze .
you really think i wouldn &apos;t notice ?
did you think it wouldn &apos;t matter ?
what happened in there ?
i screwed up , ok ?
i failed performing a song
that i &apos;ve played perfectly a thousand times .
so , let &apos;s go .
wait here .
dad , what are you doing ?
just give me a second .
dad ...
it &apos;s my fault he wasn &apos;t at his best .
i was late picking him up ,
could you just please let him play again ?
it &apos;s been a long day , ok ?
look , i understand that .
look , you &apos;re missing out . he &apos;s really amazing ...
i &apos;m sorry , let &apos;s go ...
give him another shot .
please ?
come on , don &apos;t make the kid pay for my screw up .
取消赎回权
oh , yeah . i totally get why you &apos;re still pissed at lexi ,
and it &apos;s crazy that your parents are hanging out .
it &apos;s kind of gross if you ask me ...
oh , my god , do you think your moms are telling the riveras
they bought lexi the pill ?
what ?
lexi wanted my help getting the morning @-@ after pill .
hello , if you need a pill , call kelsey ...
after she and jesus had sex . i couldn &apos;t help ,
so i guess they went to your moms .
oh , you didn &apos;t know ?
and you should have seen papa &apos;s face
when he got to the top , he a almost backed out .
that was my first and last zip @-@ line adventure .
lexi &apos;s such a good girl ,
but she &apos;s always getting me into trouble .
so , jesus ... tell me about this camp .
what do you want to know ?
well , what do you , as a non @-@ catholic ,
expect to get out of this catholic bible camp .
dad , we &apos;re not sure he &apos;s going yet anyway ,
so let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves .
oh , you &apos;re not ? - uh , well , we have some concerns .
there &apos;s nothing to be worried about . we &apos;re chaperoning .
it &apos;s going to be a great weekend .
completely supervised , separate bunks for boys and girls .
that &apos;s not exactly what we &apos;re worried about .
our hesitation has nothing
to do with chaperoning or sleeping arrangements .
our issue has to do ...
with a difference in core values , i think .
we do not want to put jesus in any kind of situation
where he might hear anything negative about his family ,
or that his mothers &apos; relationship is wrong
in the eyes of god .
oh , no . no , no , no . there &apos;s been some misunderstanding .
no , we would never let anyone ever ...
we totally support this family .
you do ?
of course we do .
what &apos;s more christian than family ?
演唱者 f @-@ units
do it , man ! let &apos;s break it ! break it !
what the hell do i care ?
going to burn the whole freaking place down .
wyatt .
wyatt !
i grew up in this house !
my mom worked so hard to pay for it !
they took it after a few missed payments !
it &apos;s just a house .
it &apos;s not you , or your family ,
or your childhood . it &apos;s just a house .
some wood ...
and some stone , and glass .
i never had a house . not in my whole life .
i &apos;m sorry they &apos;re taking yours away , but ...
you don &apos;t have to let them take away what matters .
ok ?
all the memories and stuff . that &apos;s yours .
they can &apos;t have it .
ok ?
ok ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m keeping my memories and stuff .
you want to get out of here ?
this party sucks .
演唱者 step @-@ panther
um , i &apos;m going to go find mariana , ok ?
i &apos;m going to wait outside .
hey , has anyone seen mariana ?
no , i ...
oh , hey . wait .
yeah ?
you &apos;re a cool girl , you know ?
you and wyatt are like a thing , now ?
funny . everyone i liked , likes you .
i told you that you had
nothing to worry about with me and brandon .
i know , i know . i freaked .
can you blame me ? you &apos;re the shiny new girl .
i should &apos;ve realized that you were never into brandon .
he &apos;s into you .
you &apos;re very fortunate to have such a ...
relentless father .
that was excellent . i &apos;m impressed .
but i &apos;m sorry to say i can not offer you a scholarship .
i already gave that out this afternoon .
i understand .
i &apos;m not finished .
i can &apos;t offer you a scholarship ,
but you have a lot of potential .
so , i will make room in my schedule to take you on as a student .
wow ... thank you .
thank you so much . you won &apos;t be disappointed .
good .
it &apos;ll be $ 150 an hour ,
and a minimum of two hours per week .
um ... i &apos;m sorry ... i don &apos;t ...
yeah , that &apos;s ... i got it . that &apos;ll be fine .
dad , no , you ...
shh . i &apos;m paying .
thank you .
all right .
it &apos;s settled then . see you at 5 : 00 on monday , brandon .
yes , sir .
and don &apos;t be late .
wait , wait , wait . i &apos;m no catholic ,
but the church is not in favor of ...
dad ...
you know what i mean .
sorry , the church is not in favor of same @-@ sex marriage .
well , we are .
how can you do that ?
how can you claim to be catholics
and not follow the teachings of the ...
we don &apos;t have to subscribe to every teaching
or guideline to be good catholics ...
or to be good people for that matter .
well , you can &apos;t just pick and choose .
with all due respect , everybody does .
or else i could sell you lexi &apos;s hand in marriage .
or you could stone me to death for contradicting you .
and no one wants that , do they ?
but , i have to ask you , you sit at this table
and you call these people family ,
but you don &apos;t think your daughter has a right to marry lena ?
i believe that marriage is between a man and a woman .
all right , dad .
this is supposed to be a nice dinner , not a religious symposium .
you guys , there &apos;s nothing anyone could say to change
the way i feel about my family .
i don &apos;t want to go to the stupid camp
if it &apos;s going to cause world war iii .
but seriously , moms , have some faith in me .
hey . hey , come on . wyatt &apos;s going to walk us home .
really ? oh , my god , your moms are going to kill me .
i &apos;m fine .
my turn .
wait ... mariana , wait ! no !
hey , cal .
liam .
saw your shots on instagram .
you &apos;re pretty good with that thing .
what do you want ?
i heard you were asking questions about me , so ...
i figured i &apos;d save you some time and catch up face @-@ to @-@ face .
you look great .
can &apos;t believe how much you &apos;ve grown in two years .
look , when sarah said she was staying with your family
i was just curious , that &apos;s all .
so , you missed me ?
i got to go .
hey , i &apos;m talking to you .
let go of me .
i &apos;m going to say this once ,
stop asking questions and stay the hell away from sarah .
got me ?
hey , everything ok here ?
yeah , everything &apos;s great .
just catching up with an old friend .
see you around , cal .
we got to go .
let &apos;s go .
hey ! we &apos;re walking home . why don &apos;t you come with us ?
oh , no . i &apos;m staying .
are you sure you &apos;re ok ?
i &apos;m great .
that ... that halibut was great . thanks .
yeah , of course .
i can &apos;t remember the last time that you joined us for dinner .
i can &apos;t remember the last time i was asked .
yeah , sorry about that . that &apos;s on me .
you &apos;re welcome here anytime , dad .
a phone call would &apos;ve been nice .
sorry about that .
that &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s just that ... after our little talk this afternoon
i got to thinking and i felt like i should ...
that &apos;s fine , dad .
no , no .

i need to apologize . i never should &apos;ve done that to you .
scared you like that when you were a kid .
and if forcing you to talk to that minister
drove a wedge between you and god ...
well , that &apos;s the biggest sin of all .
and i &apos;m sorry . for that .

i &apos;ll pick up a few shifts ,
get a job doing security ... something . it &apos;s a couple extra hours ?
dad , you don &apos;t have to ...

let me be the hero for once .

callie , this is sonia and ernie .

nice to meet you .

um , we were just going to bed .
no , no , mari . it &apos;s been to long .
come . come join us . come on .
wow . mariana , your nose .
you like it ?
yeah , i think it &apos;s time we called it a night . what do you say ?
yeah , mami , i &apos;m tired .
ok ...
mari , jesus is going to join us at the
church retreat next weekend ,
why don &apos;t you come , too ?
what ?
you &apos;re going to let them spend the night together
when you know they &apos;re having sex ?
you &apos;re drunk and you lied to us .
do you have anything to say for yourself ?
if your goal was to keep jesus and lexi from seeing each other ,
mariana. you certainly succeeded .
we &apos;re going to continue
this conversation in the morning , young lady .
guess we should &apos;ve made her take the nose @-@ ring out .
if we made her take it out ,
she &apos;d have come home looking like a lite @-@ brite .
sorry , i tried to get her out of there .
who &apos;s idea was it to go to this party ?
was it mariana &apos;s ?
thank you very much for not drinking ,
and for getting her home in one piece .
if this ever happens again , please , please call us .
understood ?
yeah .
ok , get to bed .
you ok ?
