and now , please welcome your valedictorian ,
alex dunphy .
where are my mom and dad ?
and in this corner ,
finishing first in her class ,
delivering the commencement address ,
weighing in at -- what do you weigh , honey ?
dad !
a healthy amount for a girl her age .
are you getting all this , buddy ?
pure gold .
she &apos;s the main brain ,
the cerebellum of the ball , alex dunphy ! !
oh , keep rolling , the news will want this footage
when i eventually snap .
i thought sanjay patel was first in the class .
he was until he missed a few weeks
and the robot he was building attacked him .
it &apos;s happening , people .
our hubris will be our undoing .
sweetie , what do you say you and i
go and get our nails done , huh ?
it &apos;s okay . i want to work on my speech .
been there .
i remember the speech that won me treasurer
of my high @-@ school spanish club .
&quot; mi nombre es felipe .
yo voy a la escuela ... &quot;
felipe .
it was kind of a grande deal .
i was up against an actual puerto rican .
honey , are you sure ?
because i think they can do school colors .
i &apos;m good , mom .
okay .
family milestones always throw claire for a loop .
she holds it in ,
and then the next day , she has a total meltdown ,
and i have to pick up the pieces .
problem is , tomorrow ,
i &apos;m supposed to go to vegas with my buds ,
so ... i need her to melt down today .
otherwise , what happens in vegas won &apos;t happen to me
because i won &apos;t be there .
emotional day , huh ?
happy day .
happy and sad .
&quot; guys , i can &apos;t go to vegas
because my wife &apos;s freaking out ! &quot;
trust me , that is not a phone call you want to make
to a bunch of ex @-@ college male cheerleaders .
they will mock you with a hurtful , rhythmic taunt .
hello ?
gloria , it &apos;s me .
ay ! how was the doctor ?
can you pick up some bread on the way home , please ?
i &apos;m home . my damn gate remote won &apos;t work .
could you press ...
hello ?
... 9 ?
manny , it &apos;s okay .
what &apos;s okay ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
where are you calling from ?
i &apos;m not calling from .
jay is calling .
what &apos;s wrong with jay ?
my clicker won &apos;t work .
oh , my god
your heart &apos;s not working ? !
how could you tell us this over the phone ? !
my heart is fine .
would somebody please press 9 and let me in ?
okay .-got it .
it won &apos;t work if you &apos;re both on the line .
okay .
okay .
every damn time !
okay , lily , time to get dressed . okay .
i can &apos;t believe alex is gonna be in high school .
i feel so old !
oh , well , you feel old .
i was there when she was born --
in the delivery room .
if i wasn &apos;t gay before , i --
oh , please , you wouldn &apos;t have lasted two minutes on a farm .
i &apos;ve witnessed all kinds of birthing --
never batted an eye .
i &apos;ve seen cattle , i &apos;ve seen hogs ,
i &apos;ve seen goats --
i &apos;ve even seen a three @-@ legged --
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
i &apos;m sorry .
really , mitchell ?
i could have just died .
principal kaizler , faculty , parents ,
fellow graduates , it &apos;s --
hey , superstar .
oh , you &apos;re working on your speech .
yep .
well , do you need any help ?
because sometimes it &apos;s great
to bounce ideas off someone whose opinion you value .
i &apos;m good .
okay . that &apos;s cool .
we could do your hair .
we could do it like we saw in that magazine .
oh , what &apos;s that actress -- what &apos;s her name ? --
with the -- you know , with the teeth ?
mom , mom , please .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m trying to concentrate . - okay .
okay .
well , you be ready to go in a half @-@ hour ,
because we are going to carpool with your grandpa .
haley &apos;s driving me .
i want to get there early .
that &apos;s a great idea .
great . i will see you there ...
superstar .
hey , mama bear . you okay ?
not with &quot; mama bear &quot; i &apos;m not .
don &apos;t cry .
i &apos;m not crying .
shh ! don &apos;t be brave .
i &apos;m here for you .
until 2 p.m. tomorrow , when my flight leaves for vegas .
where were you ? did you bring the bread ?
i was stuck outside that gate
for 10 minutes before it opened .
so no bread ?
we got to get that thing fixed . ay !
what happened to your eye ?
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s droopy .
what do you mean , &quot; droopy &quot; ?
aah . i don &apos;t like the look of that , jay .
here , let me check something .
put that thing away . i saw my dermatologist .
he was checking for moles or something .
he probably got some numbing cream on it .
it &apos;s fine !
nothing to worry about .
i got botox .
stupid doctor talked me into it ,
and now it &apos;s drifting .
i haven &apos;t felt this dumb since
i shelled out 30 bucks for that bracelet
that &apos;s supposed to give me better balance .
try to push my arm down .
okay .
go ahead . you can &apos;t do it . you can &apos;t do it .
okay . all right . i can &apos;t -- - honey , i &apos;m home .
hey , uh , why is your dad &apos;s car here ?
&quot; it &apos;s ironic that i stand up here
representing my classmates when ,
for the past three years ,
most of them have treated me like i &apos;m invisible .
it &apos;s my own fault .
i was obsessed with good grades
instead of looks , popularity , and skinny jeans . &quot;
what ? ! is that your speech ? !
get out of here !
you cannot say that !
yes , i can ! and you want to know why ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s the truth .
no one wants to hear the truth .
it &apos;s very simple , alex .
in order to give a good speech ,
all you have to do is take a song and say it ,
like ... &quot; don &apos;t stop believin &apos; &quot;
or &quot; get this party started . &quot;
that means nothing .
who cares ?
nobody wants to think .
it &apos;s a graduation ,
a celebration of being done with thinking .
people want to be challenged .
they &apos;re gonna respect me for it .
no one &apos;s ever gonna talk to you again .
so what ?
mahatma gandhi went on a hunger strike
for what he believed in .
that &apos;s &apos; cause no one would eat with him in the cafeteria !
hey , guys !
we &apos;re here .
come on over . have some lemonade and cookies .
jay , that &apos;s not looking very good .
it &apos;s fine .
quick ! who &apos;s the president ?
obama !
phil , please .
i &apos;m trying to rule out a stroke .
it &apos;s not a stroke .
why does everybody always assume i &apos;m having a stroke ?
age .
diet .
you forgot to bring my bread .
i &apos;m sorry we &apos;re late .
that &apos;s okay . we got to leave in about 5 minutes , though .
luke , stop pushing that ball around !
you &apos;re gonna fall in .
oh , yes , and then your uncle mitchell
will laugh at your expense !
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s a character flaw .
okay , okay , quick poll here .
this morning , cam , fully dressed ...
thank god it &apos;s one of those stories .
... while in the middle of a very serious thought ,
fell into a ducky pool .
oh , my goodness . are you all right ?
yes , i am . thank you .
that is a normal reaction -- love and concern .
okay , wait , wait , wait , wait .
the pool popped .
ay ! poor thing !
there is nothing worse than a tailbone injury .
i know .
seriously ? no , no , no , no .
you &apos;re so full of it .
you know this is funny .
picture this
falling into a tiny pool .
he &apos;ll be here all week , folks !
literally , because you &apos;re not coming home with me .
there she is . there &apos;s my little stella .
that &apos;s my girl .
hi , sweetie .
you &apos;re so cute ,
i just wan eat your face !
you remember when you used to hold alex like that ,
and you wanted to eat her face ?
yeah .
now she &apos;s off to high school . mm .
time marches on , huh ?
yep .
you know what &apos;s really sad ?
what ?
the end of &quot; titanic . &quot;
hey , luke .
do you realize , in two years ,
you and i will be graduating ?
not now .
i think i &apos;m moving the ball with my mind .
well , i &apos;ll be graduating .
you guys , stop congratulating yourselves
for being so compassionate .
if you had been there ,
you would have laughed just as hard as i did .
he &apos;s coming .
stop talking .
he &apos;s been embaassed enough today .
stop , stop , stop , stop , stop , stop .
wow . now it makes sense .
it &apos;s a pritchett thing .
cruelty &apos;s genetic .
suddenly it &apos;s all very clear .
be careful . you might run into it .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , cam . i &apos;m sorry .
oh , my god , dad , your face !
what ? oh , that &apos;s nothing , nothing .
it &apos;s boring . i went to the dermatologist .
it &apos;s a boring story . i &apos;m fine .
no , no , no , we got to get you to a hospital .
i &apos;m fine .
yes , i &apos;m taking you . come .
gloria , no , wait .
wait right here ! gloria ?
gloria ? !
gloria ?
gloria , hold on .
the reason my face looks like this is because i had ...
botox .
like the ladies use for their wrinkles ?
well , actually , nearly 10 % of their sales are men ,
but that &apos;s not important .
i had a bad reaction .
hit a nerve or something .
it &apos;s gonna go away soon .
what ? what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
nothing .
would you stop ?
this is very embarrassing for me .
for both of us .
he &apos;s fine . it was a false alarm .
what do you mean , a false alarm ?
his face looks like a candle .
you heard her . i &apos;m okay .
she &apos;s not a doctor .
neither are you .
technically .
okay , look , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on her
but there is no way that this is normal .
you look like a botox job gone horribly wrong .
no ... my ... god . you didn &apos;t .
of course he didn &apos;t .
did you ?
no .
you did !
what were you thinking ? you &apos;re a veteran .
enough ! this conversation is ended . let &apos;s go .
do you think he got his butt done , too ?
it looks fantastic .
alex , wait . i &apos;m sorry .
if you want to give your speech , go ahead .
i was never valedictorian . what do i know ?
thank you !
i am doing this for a reason .
it &apos;s not just like i &apos;m --
aha ! sorry , alex , but you will thank me one day !
please . you really think i don &apos;t have duplicates ?
if you do this , you &apos;ll be a social piranha .
yes , i &apos;ll be an amazonian carnivorous fish .
carniv-- what ? !
dad , open the gate .
oh , geez , not now !
what ? what &apos;s happening ?
it &apos;s stuck again .
what do you mean , it &apos;s stuck ?
can &apos;t you get it open ?
what do you think &quot; stuck &quot; means , claire ?
we have to do something , dad .
can &apos;t you -- can &apos;t you push it open or something ?
i don &apos;t know !
we are trapped in your driveway ,
and you don &apos;t know ?
as a gate owner , dad ,
you have a certain responsibility .
see , my daughter is gonna get up on that stage
and give a speech
and graduate from middle school ,
and if i am not there , dad , i am going to freak out !
i am going to freak out !
maybe push it.- do you understand what i am saying ?
do you have any idea how important ...
why are you smiling ? - i &apos;m not -- i &apos;m not smiling .
hysterical wife .
hysterical wife .
hysterical wife .
jackpot .
come on .
all right . okay , we have tried this way .
i say we ram the gate . kids , get out of the way .
hold on ! i think i can fix this !
i just need a paper clip , some olive oil ,
and a ribbon .
what &apos;s the plan , &quot; macgayver &quot; ?
actually , the paper clip
is to connect these two circuits ,
and the olive oil is to lubricate the mechanism .
and the hair ribbon is for lily .
her hair &apos;s been driving me crazy all day .
why don &apos;t we just call some cabs ?
because , mitchell , this is not times square ,
and they &apos;ll take forever .
well , then we &apos;ll just climb over the fence and start running .
no , we won &apos;t , because it &apos;s 5 miles away , phil !
and i &apos;m in big shoes , so , no .
wait , wait , wait , wait !
i save the day .
let &apos;s take this crazy bicycle ,
we throw it over the gate ,
then we take phil and we take claire ,
and then we throw them over the gate , too .
all right , what the hell is that ?
jay bought it .
he thought we were gonna use it all the time ,
but i keep hitting my boobs with my knees .
champagne problems , right ?
honey , they &apos;re not gonna ride the bike .
yeah , but i still think that we should throw it over the gate .
okay , you know what ?
thank you . thank you .
nobody else has come up with an idea .
i think i &apos;ve got a good idea .
we don &apos;t have time to build a rocket , buddy .
never mind .
okay . so ...
phil and i will go over first ,
and then you guys will throw over the bike ?
okay , step up . i &apos;ll boost you .
couldn &apos;t we get a ladder ?
please , on cheer squad i boosted girls bigger than you
to the top of a human pyramid .
now , arms at your side .
straight like a pencil .
one , two ...
we are bulldogs !
she &apos;s fine .
okay . jay , now you do me .
just grab a handful . don &apos;t be shy .
i &apos;m not giving you as much to work with .
i used to have a lot more there . i lost it .
they used to call me &quot; the grand can . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s ironic that i stand up here
representing my classmates when , for the past ... &quot;
i read the rest of your speech .
congratulations .
do you hate me ?
what ? !
you talk about how all the popular kids are shallow and lame .
i didn &apos;t mean you .
you think you have everyone figured out ,
but everybody has their stuff .
what &quot; stuff &quot; do you have ?
too many boys chasing after you ? too many parties ?
you really want to know what &quot; stuff &quot; i have ?
yeah .
i &apos;m flunking out of biology .
and now i have to go to summer school .
my friends -- all they can ever talk about nowadays
is going off to college ,
and i don &apos;t even know if i can get into college .
is that enough &quot; stuff &quot; for you ?
whatever .
you know what ?
fine . give your stupid speech .
be an outcast .
but you &apos;re only doing it to yourself
because you &apos;re smart and pretty
and sort of funny in a way that i don &apos;t really get
but other people seem to enjoy ,
so , you can either start fresh next year
or be the freak who flipped off her class .
you really think i &apos;m pretty ?
shut up !
phil , go straight !
this way &apos;s faster !
no , straight !
stop leaning !
do you want to drive ? !
i do .
tough , i called it !
d &apos;oh .
what was that ? !
oh , crap . the chain broke !
just keep pedaling . it doesn &apos;t matter .
it matters a little !
cam , please be careful .
why ?
if i get electrocuted , my hat might blow right off .
that would be funny . it &apos;s that , all right ?
no , no .
hey , jay !
i know you &apos;re feeling self @-@ conscious ,
so i dug out something i thought might help .
put that thing away .
i knew you &apos;d say that , but hear me out .
this was designed to make
a hideously disfigured man look supercool .
it &apos;s perfect for you .
oh , yikes . okay .
i &apos;ll go upstairs and see if i hava lefty .
don &apos;t look at me like that .
i have to say that i am a little disappointed
in you doing this thing .
not me .
i feel real good about it .
now many times do i have to tell you
that you don &apos;t have to look young for me ?
i didn &apos;t do it for you .
what is her name ? !
stop .
most of the time , i walk around ,
and in my head , i &apos;m 40 .
then i look in the mirror ,
i say , &quot; who &apos;s that old man ?
and what &apos;s he doing in my bathroom ? &quot;
well , it &apos;s my bathroom , too .
and i like when the old guy is there .
this is the face that i fell in love with .
not this face --
this one .
the gate &apos;s opening ! the gate &apos;s opening !
how did you do that ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
i did it .
i opened it with my mind .
come on , guys !
let &apos;s go , guys !
yeah , let &apos;s go .
manny !
get manny .
everyone in the car . let &apos;s go !
yep . that &apos;s what i thought . chain &apos;s broken .
what do you think ?
i think we gotta go .
sweetie , we-- we can &apos;t make it on foot .
we have to try .
honey .
honey !
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s not okay , phil !
it &apos;s not okay . we &apos;re losing her .
alex ?
yes .
you &apos;re not losing her .
we are . she &apos;s going to high school .
this is just when i lost haley .
this is when haley went from being my sweet little angel
to being a moody ,
texting , snotty little princess
who hates me .
haley doesn &apos;t hate you .
and we &apos;re not losing her .
do you remember when you used to come home from work
and haley would meet you at the door
in her little &quot; aladdin &quot; pajamas ?
and , you know , she &apos;d stick her arms up in the air
and say , &quot; daddy , daddy , take me on a magic carpet ride . &quot;
remember that ?
when was the last time haley was that excited to see you ?
i don &apos;t remember . it &apos;s been so long .
we &apos;re losing another one .
and that &apos;s what kids do -- they leave .
they leave , and they -- and they don &apos;t come back .
well , ours will come back , right ?
what if they don &apos;t , and --
and , pretty soon , it &apos;s just the two of us ?
i don &apos;t want to go to vegas anymore .
i know .
i just want to hug them
and embarrass them in front of their friends .
i know .
and alex -- my god .
if we miss this speech --
honey , she &apos;s a middle child --
she will never forgive us .
we &apos;re not missing that speech !
hello ! hello !
what &apos;s the plan , phil ?
mi nombre es felipe .
yo voy ...
a la escuela .
you need a ride to the school .
yes , please !
felipe ?
okay .
v anos , muchachos !
i am so proud to be standing
in front of this extraordinary group of youngsters .
i &apos;m sorry -- or should i say &quot; oldsters &quot; ?
but seriously , the word &quot; commencement &quot;
means &quot; beginning . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry i laughed .
i don &apos;t need an apology ,
but i will say your behavior today
has been very eye @-@ opening .
no offense , ja
none taken . you look like an iceberg .
okay .
this is ... right here .
okay . let &apos;s go .
muchas gracias , muchachos !
you &apos;re quite welcome !
and now , please welcome your valedictorian ,
alex dunphy .
where &apos;s my mom and dad ?
thank you .
mm -- there they are !
come on , phil !
principal kaizler ...
hold on , phil ! ...
faculty ...
oh , sweet cream ! i &apos;m sliding !
oh , my god , phil !
... school @-@ board administrators ...
i got you . get up . get up .
i got you . ...
fellow graduates ...
i &apos;m sorry ! i &apos;m so sorry !
... parents , and everyone
who helped us through these challenging formative years ,
cam ! you have lost all credibility .
this is completely different .
how ?
it &apos;s the juxtaposition of absurdist comedy
against the backdrop of a formal setting ...
not a big @-@ boned man falling into a pool .
really ?
shh ! this is about alex .
it &apos;s ironic that i stand up here representing my classmates
when ...
... they &apos;re so ...
awesome ...
they should be up here themselves .
but i &apos;m up here , and ...
i &apos;m sayin &apos; ...
stuff ,
&apos;cause everybody &apos;s got their ...
stuff ,
whether you &apos;re popular
or a drama geek ...
or a cheerleader ...
or even a nerd like me .
we all have our insecurities .
yes , we do .
we &apos;re all just trying to figure out who we are .
i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is ...
... don &apos;t stop ... believin &apos; ...
... get this party started .
that &apos;s so cute .
seriously ?
there she is .
that girl .
your speech moved me .
i loved how you play with the song titles .
fantastic .
my idea .
you did good , kid .
thanks , grandpa . aah !
don &apos;t ask . he &apos;ll be fine .
yes . we are so proud of you .
come here .
hello .
i opened a gate with my mind .
what do you say we all go get something to eat ?
let &apos;s do it . yeah .
a @-@ actually , i was kind of just invited to a party .
would it be okay if i go ?
yeah . of course .
yeah .
yay !
see you , kid . have fun .
thanks for coming , you guys !
bye ! bye ! bye ! bye !
congratulations !

oh , my god . she &apos;s back .
my baby .

my baby .
oh , my god .
my little baby .
