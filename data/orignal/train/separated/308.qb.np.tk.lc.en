max , i have a surprise , and it &apos;s right behind you .
before i turn around , is it oprah ?
&apos;cause i will die .
it &apos;s a diploma from pastry school .
no , seriously , what &apos;s the surprise ?
i &apos;ll even take gayle .
you would &apos;ve graduated if the school hadn &apos;t closed ,
and oleg knows a guy who fakes documents , so ...
you &apos;re a pastry school graduate ,
and i &apos;m a real estate agent and a french citizen .
i &apos;ll be able to show houses in france .
and how are you getting there ?
i &apos;m also a licensed pilot .
look , i am not a pastry school graduate .
i &apos;m not even a high school graduate .
the only thing i graduated from was a scared straight program ,
which is why i &apos;m not gay anymore .
max , you really didn &apos;t graduate ?
i always thought you were kidding about dropping out of high school ,
like when you say that howard stern is your dad .
&apos;cause he is . look at our eyes .
and i did drop out .
i was like , &quot; later , suckas .
i &apos;ll find a water fountain somewhere else &quot; &quot;
water fountains ? gross .
in private school ,
we never bent down to put our mouths on something
unless it had a yacht .
i didn &apos;t need a piece of paper from high school ,
and i don &apos;t need this fake piece of paper ,
because i don &apos;t fake things .
except orgasms with guys who don &apos;t know
how to yank hair good .
well , i &apos;m glad you called back ,
you slimeball .
oh , good .
when you weren &apos;t here when i woke up , i got worried .
so worried you decided to eat cookies and watch mama &apos;s family ?
we all grieve in our own way .
guess i should cancel the strippers .
so i found out something interesting today
that has to do with you .
aw , crap , you found out what happened in orlando ?
why ? what happened in orlando ?
don &apos;t tell me you slept with mickey mouse .
well , i slept with someone with suspenders and four fingers .
i &apos;m assuming it was mickey .
either way , it was heaven .
well , i found out
that you &apos;re not the badass you claim to be .
i talked to your old high school principal ,
and he said the only reason you didn &apos;t graduate
is &apos; cause you failed to show up for one history final .
my high school &apos;s still standing ?
guess i didn &apos;t flick that cigarette far enough .
i cannot believe you &apos;d invade my privacy like that .
invade your privacy ?
you shave your junk with the door open .
so ?
to the apartment .
well , maybe you &apos;ll change your mind
when you find out that the principal--
your old history teacher , mr. huck--
said you can come back and take the test this friday ,
and if you pass , you &apos;ll get your diploma .
if that &apos;s mr. huck , i will murder your face .
max , please don &apos;t kill me .
i can live here , but i can &apos;t die here .
hey , girls .
i got google glasses .
see , right now , i &apos;m looking at you
and ordering tapioca on amazon .
now is not a great time , sophie .
max is upset with me
because i &apos;m trying to help her graduate from high school .
aw , you &apos;re sure she &apos;s just not upset with you
&apos;cause of the way you chew ?
i &apos;m sorry i have to chew , everyone .
i found out max can go take one history test in her hometown ,
and then she &apos;ll get her diploma .
max , you know i &apos;ve never been a big fan
of hers ...
but i like the idea of you getting that degree .
i mean , i &apos;ll never live down
not graduating from school for the deaf .
you &apos;re not deaf , sophie .
i know . it was really hard .
well , i don &apos;t care who she called ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m not gonna do it .
and if mr. huck thinks i would ever step foot
back in his mr. know @-@ it @-@ all university ,
i have two words for him .
&quot; huck u . &quot;
that &apos;s what mr. huck said you &apos;d say .
he also said that senior year ,
you sold &quot; huck u &quot; t @-@ shirts
and that you have no ambition and no follow @-@ through .
that &apos;s when i knew he was really your teacher .
no ambition ?
i made enough off those shirts
to do nothing for , like , a month .
look , i got two bus tickets to rhode island .
i didn &apos;t even know you could buy bus tickets ahead of time .
i thought you just showed up , and if you looked like
you made enough mistakes in life , they let you on .
come on , max .
i haven &apos;t waited this long to hear someone say yes
since i was at school for the deaf .
fine .
fine , i &apos;ll go .
but only because mr. huck thinks i won &apos;t .
aw , okay , well , i &apos;m gonna let you two start studying .
and in full disclosure ,
i watched some porno during this conversation .
see ya later .
hey , max .
caroline told everyone the good news
about you going back to take that american history test .
good for you .
yeah , i started studying last night ,
and on behalf of all white people ,
i would like to apologize for everything ever .
well , apology accepted for everything ever
except for slavery and the gap .
here , max , i brought you the history book
which i &apos;m studying from for my citizenship test .
aren &apos;t babies automatically citizens ?
i don &apos;t know why i root for you .
here , your country has a very rich past ,
unlike korea , which had its past stolen by the japanese .
han , we are not talking about european history .
we are talking about american history .
oof , you &apos;re going to be working here forever .
good luck , lady .
okay , max , i &apos;ve come up with a way
for you to work and study at the same time ,
like when you shop and steal at the same time .
i know , when they show it to me on those security cameras ,
i &apos;m always impressed .
i mean , i really don &apos;t know anyone else who &apos;s doing it .
max , pick @-@ up . burrito for table eight .
ugh , jeez , i just walked in .
why do i have to have all this burrito drama ?
first , caroline says i have to quiz you
every time you come to the window , so ...
who was the sexually virile male pop singer
responsible for the hit song jessie &apos;s girl ?
rick springfield .
burrito &apos;s all yours , smarty .
oleg , no .
you have to ask questions from the flash cards i provided .
they &apos;re color @-@ coordinated by century
and subdivided by president .
don &apos;t look at me like that , max .
i &apos;m a fun person . i taught myself the dougie .
okay , here goes .
which amendment to the united states constitution
guarantees a woman &apos;s right to ...
vote ?
wait , women can vote ?
so when you say women can vote ,
you mean , like , besides for american idol ?
max , you think you &apos;re not smart , but you are .
you just need to come up with little tricks
to help jog your memory .
my memory doesn &apos;t jog .
i &apos;ve smoked so much pot , it &apos;s in one of those hospitals
learning to walk again .
what was the great compromise ?
you mean besides you moving in with me ?
it created the two houses of congress .
next question : what was the movement
against the sale or drinking of alcohol called ?
the bowel movement ?
no , the temperance movement .
and don &apos;t mention the bathroom .
i &apos;ve had to pee since we passed that last town
that used to make something .
just go to the bathroom .
what are you so afraid of ?
the bathroom .
i will use a public bathroom .
i will use a public bus .
but i will not use the public bathroom on a public bus .
next card .
no , give me a twizzler . i know enough .
no candy . study harder .
you &apos;re looking at a solid &quot; d. &quot;
well , my grades should match my boobs .
next question . okay .
in what city was the constitution written ?
no idea .
philadelphia ?
oh , damn it , i almost said that .
it &apos;s right there .
philadelphia makes cheesesteaks .
the constitution is cheesy .
why do i doubt myself ?
how much further ?
i thought rhode island was supposed to be a tiny state .
when are we stopping ?
well , we have to pass cranston , providence ,
and then our stop is hope .
wait , max , you were born in a town called &quot; hope &quot; ?
well , just outside hope .
and success and money .
well , there &apos;s no hope for me .
i have to pee so badly . i &apos;m going in .
leave the twizzlers .
here , study .
oh , my god .
you know the toilet isn &apos;t just there as a suggestion .
wow , north east high .
never thought i &apos;d be here again .
this sure brings back no memories .
it &apos;s cute .
you know , in an underfunded public school kind of way .
wait , are you in high school ?
oh , my god , i &apos;m a hundred .
oh , there it is , 2 @-@ c.
hold on .
why are you covering those up ?
they &apos;re the only reason i passed chemistry .
max black .
mr. huck .
i &apos;m surprised .
that i showed up ?
no , that you &apos;re alive .
you and me both , sister .
and you must be caroline .
oh , you look just like the girls
max used to give wedgies to in the cafeteria .
still does .
oh , ladies , this is hector .
hector will be joining us today ,
as he was not in attendance during exam day .
ay , yo , mr. huck , that &apos;s &apos; cause my sister didn &apos;t wake me up
&apos;cause she &apos;s a bitch .
very good .
this place is filled with tiny tables , yo .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s teachers and delinquents only
beyond this point .
you can wait out there .
are you nervous ?
a little .
i forgot i have a joint in my purse ,
and i don &apos;t want to get expelled .
max , you can do this .
i think you think you can &apos;t ,
but i know that you can .
look at me .
you are smart .
what are you ?
smart .
see , you already got one question right .
okay , kids ,
put on your thinking hats .
ay , yo , i thought we couldn &apos;t wear hats in the classroom .
i &apos;m going to ignore that ,
because if i don &apos;t , i will weep .
&quot; in 1775 , paul revere warned which two men
that the british were coming to arrest them ? &quot;
in the beastie boys song paul revere ,
he had a horsie and a quart of beer .
sam adams is a beer , and if you have too much ,
与山姆 · 亚当斯同名
you end up giving a john a hancock .
sam adams and john hancock !
i wasn &apos;t this nervous when i waited for the results of a hep c test .
then again , i didn &apos;t study for that one at all .
ay , yo , i think i nailed it .
you failed , hector .
for real ?
for really real .
you even got the answer wrong
that max so graciously said out loud .
aw , that &apos;s cool , mr. huck .
next time , right ?
sure .
max , i &apos;m sorry to tell you that ...
i was wrong to doubt you .
you got a &quot; b. &quot;
you passed .
you lying son of a bitch .
it &apos;s true , max .
in fact , i went over it three times
to make sure i wasn &apos;t insane .
whatever that friend of yours there did to help you ,
it really worked .
i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t stand out there any longer .
i &apos;ve caused a small pandemic of erections in freshman boys .
i passed ! i got a &quot; b &quot; !
now my grade matches your boobs !
i &apos;m getting that stupid diploma
i said i didn &apos;t care about .
you can do more than get that diploma , max .
graduation is tomorrow , and if you stay overnight ,
you can walk with the class in the morning .
uh , yes .
you want to go to graduation ?
that &apos;s so me of you .
well , i busted my &quot; a &quot; to get that &quot; b , &quot;
and i want to get the whole package .
that &apos;s great .
well , we &apos;ll see you tomorrow at 10 : 00 a.m.
and , hector , we &apos;ll see you in front of the am / pm
asking strangers to buy you beer ?
i call the bed . you can have the table .
max , that bed is so tiny ,
we &apos;re gonna have to spoon .
the only spoon that &apos;s ever been in this room
was hovering over a flame .
well , it &apos;s cute .
i &apos;m not vaccinated for anything in here , but ...
it &apos;s cute .
and safe .
yeah , they have cable ,
and you can rent rooms by the hour ,
so i used to come here to watch sex and the city
with a prostitute named tiny marge .
she &apos;d bring me banana bread and hang out .
it was fun .
oh , great .
there &apos;s no coffeemaker .
never mind , found it .
your mom wasn &apos;t worried when you &apos;d come down here ?
no .
she was a little jealous that i was hanging out
with tiny marge without her , but ...
the only thing my mom ever worried about was herself .
she &apos;s selfish .
she missed my birth
&apos;cause she &quot; had a thing . &quot;
come on , she can &apos;t be that bad .
turns out , you &apos;re not that big of a high school dropout ,
and she &apos;s probably not that big of a monster .
i mean , she raised you alone , and you didn &apos;t die .
i did actually , twice .
but in fairness to her , she wasn &apos;t there either time .
max , why don &apos;t you invite her to your graduation ?
and don &apos;t say you don &apos;t have her number .
i know it &apos;s in your phone under &quot; lady i came out of . &quot;
i also know i &apos;m in your phone as &quot; fart monster . &quot;
that &apos;s because i know , like , three carolines .
no , you don &apos;t .
busted .
here , i &apos;ll dial , you just leave the message .
here .
no !
max !
fart monster !
just do it .
you &apos;ll be so happy when you see her there tomorrow .
if we live through the night .
hey , it &apos;s me , max .
brown hair , lived in you for 7.1 / 2 months
due to your inability to read the warnings
on the side of cigarettes .
listen , i &apos;m graduating from high school tomorrow ,
so if you &apos;re not busy looking for pills under the stove
or selling the neighbor &apos;s cat for beer money ,
why don &apos;t you come ?
max !
what ? that was a first draft .
hit three , delete , rerecord .
hey , it &apos;s me , max .
look , i &apos;m getting my degree tomorrow at the high school .
you know , that &apos;s the building between the bar you drink at
and the bar you dance at , so ...
hit three , delete , rerecord .
hey , it &apos;s max .
i &apos;m graduating from high school tomorrow .
if you can make it , it starts at 10 : 00 .
okay , bye .
see , that wasn &apos;t hard .
this duvet is , but that wasn &apos;t .
how come they only give you one of these ?
okay , max , maybe don &apos;t say anything else ,
or they &apos;ll take your diploma back .
okay , graduates , it &apos;s time .
everyone line up alphabetically ,
and let &apos;s make our way .
oh , and congratulations .
you did it .
max , you look so smart in that robe .
i &apos;m not that smart .
i just found out you &apos;re supposed to wear clothes under this thing .
max , i never asked you .
you were so close to getting your diploma .
why didn &apos;t you take that test ?
i was going to , but my mother
kept me out of school that day to go to the mall .
on finals day ?
was there at least a special appearance by raven @-@ symone ?
曾主演迪士尼最成功喜剧 《 天才魔女 》
no one good ever came here .
just like my mother didn &apos;t come here today .
there &apos;s still time . maybe she &apos;ll come .
maybe .
i mean , my dad was late to my graduation
because his helicopter needed to refuel .
yeah , that &apos;s probably what happened to my mom .
but her helicopter &apos;s probably passed out on top of her .
i have never been more confident ,
because as i stand here and look out at all of you today ...
i was my class valedictorian .
i realize nobody can stop us .
mm @-@ hmm , yeah , i thought that too .
we are the future .
sure we are , until you have to pee on a bus in ten years .
thank you , amy .
it &apos;s hard to imagine not hearing that voice
every day for the next four years .
thank you .
hi , mrs.--ms.-- max &apos;s mom .
this is caroline channing , your daughter max &apos;s
best friend and roommate and business partner .
i didn &apos;t want to leave this on a voice mail ,
but i cannot believe you didn &apos;t show up
to your own daughter &apos;s graduation
when you are the sole reason she didn &apos;t graduate in the first place .
i mean , who takes their daughter to the mall on finals day ?
what kind of mother are you ?
and all the times i &apos;ve defended you to max--
not to make it about me , but it was a lot--
saying , &quot; she &apos;s not that bad . she &apos;s not that bad . &quot;
well , i guess you are that bad . max is right .
you are a monster .
if you &apos;re on your way , we &apos;re in the second row .
i have blonde hair .
christina bayers .
whoo , that &apos;s my granddaughter !
salazar belmonte .
that &apos;s my boy !
max black .
max black .
that &apos;s my downstairs neighbor !
so what , you called them all ?
yeah , you know , just in case .
max , you were right , and i was wrong .
your mother &apos;s really as bad as you said .
mm , oh , it &apos;s not that bad .
what do you mean ?
she took you to the mall on finals day .
yeah , but it was the greatest day we ever had .
we got ice cream ,
we ate it in the massage chairs at brookstone ,
and then a kid fell in the fountain ,
and we died laughing .
well , i guess you can graduate high school any day ,
but you can only watch a kid
almost drown in a fountain once .
it is okay that she wasn &apos;t there today ,
because you were .
and none of this would have been possible
if you hadn &apos;t pushed me .
and that kid wouldn &apos;t have almost drowned
if i hadn &apos;t pushed him .
little different .
bottom line , you had faith in me
like thomas jefferson had faith in lewis and clark .

now you &apos;re both nerds !
