they &apos;re running drugs through the bar , jack .
we found narcotics and a handgun
hidden in the bilge .
declan porter , you &apos;re under arrest .
no . wait ! wait ! stop . it &apos;s mine .
marco and i are in talks
to find him a position within the company .
after what he did ?
it &apos;s just smart business . right , nolan ?
so it &apos;s official . he &apos;she new c.e.o.
my son is very much in love with you .
persuade him to drop his interest in grayson global ,
and i will stand behind you every step of the way .
your ex @-@ fiancee just broke up with me .
a fake up ?
i &apos;d say daniel &apos;s already thinking ... make up .
that &apos;s the idea .
you realize i &apos;m three moves away from snapping your neck ?
if you do that , how will you ever reunite with your sister ?
if i have to play nice with daniel for a little while ,
then it &apos;s a small price to pay .
they say the best @-@ laid plans
often go awry .
because no matter how detailed the preparation ...
a plan will always have a weak point .
and there will always be those looking to exploit it .
to doom a plan to failure ,
and the perpetrator along with it .
where you been ?
thinking .
about the kiss .
look , i &apos;m sorry that you had to see that ,
but it didn &apos;t mean anything .
i &apos;m sure it did to daniel .
you know , you asked me to trust you .
well , you need to trust me , too .
you can &apos;t just disappear
when things get a little bit uncomfortable .
like it or not , daniel is the best remaining link
to the people who destroyed our families .
i didn &apos;t come here last night
to keep tabs on you and daniel .
i came to tell you
that helen crowley made contact with me .
or more accurately ,
she allowed me to make contact with her .
the initiative knows who you are ?
not entirely .
takeda &apos;s security measures seem to have held up .
they don &apos;t appear to know anything about you
or our deeper connection .
what did she want from you ?
my complicity .
she ... told me that colleen was still alive .
did she offer you proof ?
no .
then there &apos;s no reason to believe them .
they will say anything to manipulate you .
i understand that , but ... look ,
if--if she thinks i &apos;m under their thumb , then--
then we &apos;ve got a direct line to the initiative ,
which doesn &apos;t involve you falling back in with daniel .
can you still contact her ?
no .
said she &apos;s gonna contact me .
then we need to draw her out .
your 9 : 00 am-- emily thorne--is here .
thank you , grace . send her in .
good morning .
morning .
i &apos;m sorry . was that not ...
no , it &apos;s , uh--
i just thought after last night , we--
we did kiss , right ? i @-@ i didn &apos;t dream that ?
yes , and it was--it was great .
i just , um ...
i just want to make sure that whatever &apos;s happening here ,
that , you know , we &apos;re taking it slowly .
yeah .
yeah , probably a good idea .
i actually came here to talk to you
about a children &apos;s charity that i &apos;ve been working with
since 2008 .
okay . tell me about it .
basically , the organization assists kids in danger
of slipping through the foster care system .
if you meant what you said
about rehabilitating grayson global &apos;s image ,
i &apos;d like to invite your top @-@ tier investors
to our annual wine auction .
excuse me . this came for you .
hand delivered with a note marked &quot; urgent . &quot;
stonehaven united solutions . who sent this ?
helen crowley . she &apos;s holding on line two .
i gotta take this .
um , grace , can you give ms. thorne
my confidential client list ?
sure . okay .
thank you .
can i call you later ?
yes . please do .
i &apos;ll be right back with that list .
um , grace , do you mind if i use your phone ?
mine &apos;s out of battery .
sure . just dial 9 to get out .
thank you so much .
helen .
hello , daniel .
do you have the stonehaven prospectus in front of you ?
yeah , i &apos;m looking at it right now .
the question is , why ?
consider it a gift .
this time next quarter ,
that company is poised to triple its revenues ,
only they don &apos;t know it yet .
oh , but you do ?
why else would i recommend you acquire it ?
have the same killer instinct you showed
in assimilating nolcorp
before someone else beats you to it .
speaking of , have you followed up
on our previous discussion ?
i did . your hunch was right .
there are some gaps in nolcorp &apos;s early r &amp; d .
ms. thorne , here &apos;s our client list .
yes , i will be by this afternoon
to check the flower arrangements .
okay . thanks .
here you go . hope it &apos;s helpful .
thank you .
victoria .
i think i have some information for you .
so you &apos;re saying the cops are the ones
who tipped off nate and kenny ?
it &apos;s the only explanation .
they knew the police were coming ,
so they moved all the drugs onto the boat to set me up .
and i played right into their hands .
i &apos;m calling emily for bail money .
i don &apos;t want her involved in this .
fine . nolan , then .
you &apos;re not spending another night here .
i don &apos;t want to drag any of our friends
into this mess , okay ?
jack , this is no time to be stubborn .
whoever gets us the bail money
will get it back .
no prosecutor &apos;s gonna believe for one second
those drugs belong to you .
and if they trace the registration to the gun ,
they &apos;re gonna find out--
that it was used to kill kenny and nate &apos;s father
six years ago .
and it belonged to my dad .
so , um ...
this whole setup is what ,
payback for what happened to their father ?
you can &apos;t do
anything against the ryans .
they will hurt you
or declan ...
or carl .
amanda , promise me .
enjoy , conrad . they &apos;re imported straight from cuba .
that &apos;s very kind of you ,
but completely unnecessary .
yes .
jason ?
oh , what a delight .
victoria , it &apos;s been too long .
what brings you out to the hamptons ?
good sportsmanship .
it appears my 20 @-@ year rivalry with your husband
has come to an end .
uh , jason brought by a box of cubans
to commemorate my retirement .
is that what they call corporate exile these days ?
oh , trust me .
i &apos;m only too happy to be done with the private sector .
and what does the public sector promise ,
a run for office ?
perhaps .
just when i thought
i had the biggest ego in the tristate area .
i &apos;m sorry .
conrad , may i have a word alone with you ?
gladly .
jason , please excuse us .
i know . i know . the man is an ogre .
that &apos;s what i get for opening my own door .
i could care less
about your petty rivalry with jason prosser .
i am concerned with helen crowley .
apparently , she directed our son to acquire a company
called stonehaven united solutions .
does that mean anything to you ?
stonehaven is a disaster recovery firm , if memory serves .
this , dear , is what the initiative does .
they influence upheaval and then profit in the aftermath .
aftermath of what ,
another flight 197 ?
how did you happen upon this little morsel ?
while you &apos;re busy debating your bid for political office ,
i have been securing alliances
close to daniel
that will help ensure the future of this family .
and if you &apos;re not going to do anything
to thwart these devils , i will .
and how do you intend to do that ?
sabotage .
第二季第十一集
thank you for the stonehaven tip , emily .
of course . is it significant ?
it &apos;s hard to say just yet .
but to that end ,
i &apos;m not sure how including daniel
in your upcoming charity auction would convince him
to abandon his post at grayson global .
i know . i &apos;m afraid that was in the works
before we had our conversation ,
and it &apos;s hard to turn a ship on a dime .
ah , well , c &apos;est la guerre .
as long as you &apos;re going through with it ,
might i suggest that you invite jason prosser to the event ?
jason prosser of prosser wealth funds ?
oh , you know of him ?
of course , but isn &apos;t he one of grayson global &apos;s
biggest competitors ?
yes .
men like conrad and jason
judge their manhood by the size of their wallets .
and it &apos;s always been my experience
that the most lucrative charity auctions
are the ones that pit
two corporate egos against each other .
with your permission ,
i &apos;m sure i could get jason to attend .
permission granted .
declan . amanda .
i &apos;m guessing by the faces ,
our boy jack &apos;s still in the penalty box .
thanks to you setting him up .
i mean , what the hell do you guys want ?
can we just get it out ?
hey , settle down , kid .
you want out ? that &apos;s simple .
you just sell us the rest of the bar .
in fact , uh , that should cover it right there .
hey , this is our home , you son of a bitch .
we &apos;re not going anywhere .
declan , easy .
you probably need your big bro &apos;s signature
to make it official anyway , so i tell you what--
why don &apos;t you get back to us in about , mm ,
10 to 15 years when he gets out , okay ?
he &apos;s just shooting his mouth off .
he does that .
when he &apos;s not planting drugs or guns
on our boat , you mean ?
don &apos;t play innocent with me .
take my advice , okay ?
go along to get along .
i don &apos;t want any more trouble for you guys .
i think you know what you can do with your advice , kenny .
i read through the tech report you provided
of everything nolcorp has in development .
impressive , right ?
incomplete , actually .
there were significant resources allocated
between 2004 and 2006 to a project
that &apos;s vanished from the books .
something called carrion .
look , daniel , not all our r &amp; d yields viable products .
well , whatever it did yield could be sold off
to recoup our losses .
unless you &apos;re hiding something from me .
i &apos;m not hiding anything from you .
but it has always been my rule
to keep failed development in house .
well , everything we do incorporates bits and pieces--
well , there are new rules now , nolan ,
full disclosure being one of them .
now i want a report
detailing all of your abandoned development ,
and i want it by the end of the week .
what was that about ?
my guess ?
extreme daddy issues .
had enough time away ?
i &apos;ve been thinking ,
and ... i was never qualified
to be your c.f.o. in the first place ,
so i don &apos;t care about losing my position .
but i care about you .
and if you &apos;ll have me ,
i &apos;d like to come back to work .
padma ...
you &apos;re smart .
there are so many better opportunities out there .
unless those opportunities
have an office down the hall with you in it ,
i &apos;m not interested .
okay . you &apos;re hired .
again .
hired to what capacity exactly ?
you know , let &apos;s not get all territorial .
i &apos;m sure we can find room for our former c.f.o.
we found room for you , didn &apos;t we ?
of course .
we &apos;ll figure something out .
welcome . welcome back .
he &apos;s not happy .
neither am i.
i don &apos;t have a date for
emily &apos;s charity wine auction tomorrow night .
any ideas ?
conrad .
ms. davenport . well , i knew you had moxie ,
but showing your face back here so soon ,
if i weren &apos;t so intrigued , i &apos;d be shocked .
i &apos;m here to protect an investment .
and what investment would that be ?
my time whilst in your family &apos;s employ .
i believe i may still be owed a few dividends .
blackmail .
of course .
is there anything that isn &apos;t beneath you ?
i don &apos;t want hush money .
the truth is , it would be unwise for me
to start over in a place
where my ability to hold any number of secrets
might not be as valued as it is in the grayson fold .
oh , well , in case you hadn &apos;t noticed ,
my traitorous son now sits atop my former throne ,
in no small part to your assistance .
so as it stands ,
i &apos;m hardly in a position
to rehire you in your former capacity .
we can look at this either of two ways .
i know where the bodies are buried ,
proverbial and otherwise .
i &apos;ve been privy to all manner of chicanery ,
from fictional kidnappings to inflated investor returns .
and the other way , ms. davenport ?
quite simply , i am good at what i do .
and whilst your family breathes ,
there will be a demand for my talents .
you do realize you &apos;re asking to reenter victoria &apos;s orbit .
well , as per my terms ,
all of which are nonnegotiable ,
the dragon lady is yours to wrangle .
well , serendipity prevails ...
ms. davenport .
you see , these talents you speak of
make you particularly well @-@ suited
to assist in my next endeavor .
so we have a deal ?
you might call it that .
well done .
the net worth on this guest list
exceeds the g.d.p. of most small countries .
well , i don &apos;t like to take &quot; no &quot; for an answer .
that makes the two of us .
there is , however , one client of yours
that i &apos;m having trouble nailing down--
um ... helen crowley .
aiden mentioned something about meeting her
at one of your investor luncheons this summer .
you invited aiden ?
no . i invited aiden &apos;s boss .
aiden r.s.v.p. &apos; d .
but if he &apos;s willing to contribute to the cause ,
i can &apos;t say no .
daniel grayson .
ms. crowley ,
hello .
evening , daniel .
i , uh , i hope i &apos;m not interrupting anything .
no , not at all .
just dinner with my colleague emily thorne .
she &apos;s a consultant for our philanthropic concerns .
uh , in fact , she &apos;d love a word with you if that &apos;s okay .
helen , you &apos;re on with emily .
so nice to meet you .
and you , too , ms . crowley .
listen , i know how valuable your time is , so ...
i &apos;ll get right to it .
i &apos;m hosting a charity wine auction tomorrow night .
well , i imagine daniel &apos;s told you
that i &apos;m a @-@ a very private person .
i don &apos;t make a habit of going to parties .
oh , well , i was hoping you would make an exception .
you see , our charity supports foster kids
who have aged out of the system .
they have nowhere to go , no guidance .
it can be a really scary time for them .
and ... well , the more deep pockets in attendance ,
the better it reflects on daniel as the new c.e.o.
i like the way you think .
perhaps i can put in an appearance .
terrific .
i &apos;ll put you on the v.i.p. list .
if all your consultants are this tenacious , daniel ,
i predict good things for your future .
go back to your meeting . i &apos;ll call later .
very impressive , ms. thorne .
i had a curious conversation
with daniel grayson recently .
he was inquiring ...
about our early software development .
that seems like a standard inquiry .
he just wants to assure fiscal transparency .
oh , i think it was more calculated than that .
he was inquiring about carrion .
there &apos;s no way he could &apos;ve happened upon that information , so ...
somebody must have tipped him off .
and you think it was me ?
you were the one that dusted carrion off and put her on my desk .
i did that to remind you
of the greatness you &apos;re capable of .
nolan , i &apos;m trying to--
to rebuild the trust you once had in me ,
not destroy it .
look , i wanna ...
believe you , marco .
i do .
but , uh , you can see why that might be difficult .
okay , i &apos;ll tell you what i see .
right before daniel comes snooping around ,
a certain girl conveniently shows back up into your life ?
you know , i seem to remember you coming back into my life
in exactly the same fashion .
the only difference being that i lost my whole company
to grayson global the day you did .
and you know how sorry i am about that .
look , at some point ,
we are gonna have to put this behind us .
did i tell you how beautiful you look in that dress ?
twice , actually .
well , what can i say ?
some things are worth repeating .
master grayson .
jason prosser , what a surprise .
nice to see you , daniel .
and congrats on the nolcorp coup .
aggressive play .
your old man never could &apos;ve put that deal to bed so quickly .
don &apos;t be so sure .
whatever acumen i have for the job
i owe to my father .
he was my mentor .
and now he &apos;s not even an employee .
who is this lovely lady ?
emily thorne .
uh , i &apos;m so happy you could make it , mr. prosser .
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i thought you two knew each other .
actually , your mother invited me this evening .
and you better have brought your checkbook .
victoria , aren &apos;t you a vision ?
ah , among other things .
hello , you two .
i have to say how happy it makes me to see you together again .
jason , you &apos;ll be pleased to know
that i had the bar stocked
with the oldest japanese whiskey known to mankind .
come .
what was that about ?
the rivalry between my dad and prosser is legendary .
she probably invited him here
to embarrass me on the auction block .
i &apos;m gonna get a refill .
looks like &quot; faux @-@ mance : part deux &quot; is a runaway success .
how &apos;s your other boyfriend handling it ?
as well as can be expected .
oh , look at you , all gussied up like 007 , again .
so what do you got for us today , q. ?
well , per moneypenny &apos;s request ,
i &apos;ve taken the building &apos;s utility network wireless .
this nolpad controls all its system .
mood lighting , anyone ?
perfect . good to have you on the team .
i &apos;m gonna find out what &apos;s keeping my date .
so ... you think helen &apos;s gonna make an appearance ?
no question .
i &apos;m convinced she has daniel &apos;s office wired .
she &apos;ll come because she &apos;s curious .
curious about what ?
you .
i led her to believe that
you &apos;re the one that suggested that she come tonight .
right .
aiden , are you ready for this ?
you seem distracted .
anything but . on with the show .
they want the bar , jack .
and nate offered $ 1 .
not for a million dollars are they getting the bar from us .
i know . that &apos;s what i said , but ...
you know , what i can &apos;t figure out
is why they want it so bad in the first place .
it &apos;s time you knew the truth .
and declan won &apos;t answer my phone calls .
it &apos;s as if i did something wrong .
did i do something wrong ?
this isn &apos;t about you .
declan &apos;s just trying to keep you safe .
from the ryan brothers ?
they &apos;re the ones behind everything
that &apos;s been happening at the stowaway ,
from matt duncan getting beaten half to death
to jack being framed for drug trafficking .
well , what can we do ?
go to your parents .
my parents ? why ?
if the ryan brothers want money ,
i &apos;ve got plenty of my own .
it isn &apos;t about money .
it &apos;s about power and influence .
your mother &apos;s on record saying
she &apos;d do anything for me .
my mother isn &apos;t exactly known for living up to her word .
my father , on the other hand , owes me big @-@ time .
$ 50,000 . going once .
twice . sold .
congratulations to aiden mathis of takeda industries .
uh , thank you . and let me assure you that mr. takeda
will be enjoying this bottle personally .
thank you .
and now for our final item of tonight &apos;s auction--
the belle of the ball @-@ a 1945 chateau d &apos;huet .
we &apos;ll start the bidding off at a modest $ 10,000 .
$ 10,000 . thank you . do i have $ 20,000 ?
thank you . who will give me $ 25,000 ?
do i have $ 25,000 ?
$ 25,000 . $ 50,000 ? do i hear $ 50,000 ?
we have a bid for $ 50,000 .
do i hear $ 60,000 ?
$ 100,000 .
$ 100,000 from mr. grayson .
do i hear $ 150,000 ? $ 150,000 ?
you haven &apos;t lost your nerve , have you , jason ?
the economy &apos;s not that bad .
do i hear $ 150,000 ?
$ 200,000 .
$ 200,000 from mr. prosser .
hell , make it half a mil .
and i don &apos;t even drink wine .
$ 500,000 from mr. ross .
do i hear $ 600,000 ?
$ 600,000 .
$ 700,000 .
$ 750,000 .
$ 750,000 . do i hear $ 800,000 ?
$ 800,000 . thank you . do i hear $ 850,000 ?
$ 850,000 .
$ 850,000 .
do i hear--
$ 1 million .
$ 1 million from mr. grayson .
is anyone willing to go higher ?
a million going once .
going twice .
sold to mr. daniel grayson . congratulations .
mr. grayson , congratulations .
thank you .
that was great .
thank you so much .
did you just invite me here to make your boy seem less ...
boyish in front of his investors ?
no , jason .
i invited you here because i enjoy your company .
well , if that &apos;s true ,
perhaps we could continue this conversation
somewhere a little more private .
well , then . let &apos;s have another round .
but the terrace is private enough .
daniel .
helen , you made it .
sorry i &apos;m late .
is the auction ...
it &apos;s finished .
you missed a good show .
bidding got quite spirited towards the end there .
oh , what a shame . i did so want to contribute .
i &apos;m sorry . have you two met ?
aiden mathis , helen crowley .
aiden ...
mathis .
oh , pleasure .
oh , excuse me . i think it &apos;s time to pay the piper .
yes .
i was hoping you &apos;d make an appearance .
really ? hope is so inactive .
and it seems to me you went to great lengths
to get me here tonight--
employing daniel &apos;s ex @-@ fiancee to reach me on your behalf .
oh , the tangled web we weave , mr. mathis .
i just want to see my sister .
well , we &apos;ll talk later .
then i &apos;m at your service .
what do you suppose those two are chatting about ?
think aiden &apos;s starting to hedge his bets ?
that &apos;s a very good question .
1 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 .
i never thought giving away a million bucks
could feel so good .
i assume your charity accepts simple donations as well .
how kind of you .
you must be emily .
helen crowley .
helen .
how wonderful to finally put a face to the name .
it sure is .
though i am sorry to say , i was just on my way out .
oh , well , you mustn &apos;t leave empty @-@ handed .
let me find you a bottle of wine .
no , i don &apos;t drink . it clouds my judgment .
well ... thank you for your generosity .
i should probably go
settle up with the caterers and the vintners .
it might take a little while so--
how--how about a drink later , just you and me ?
sure .
lovely to meet you , helen .
you , too , emily .
so i vetted stonehaven united ,
and i &apos;m not bullish on their financials .
well , like this , i know it &apos;s a worthy cause .
my recommendation stands .
daniel ... indecision is a sign of weakness in a leader ,
and you need to be better than
your father in every facet .
you buy that company now so you don &apos;t regret it later .
good night .
you &apos;re asking me to seriously question
the integrity of a police investigation
based on the word of the accused and the mother of his child ?
daddy , you of all people should understand .
you &apos;ve been framed just like jack .
uh , the difference being ,
i was 100 % certain of my innocence .
now if declan would like a safe harbor
until this storm passes ,
he &apos;s more than welcome to stay here .
but as for your baby daddy , ms. clarke ,
i hope you can respect
that i have to act more prudently with regard
to the influence my name affords me .
your wife publicly welcomed me into your family .
i nearly died in this house and i didn &apos;t ask for anything .
oh , no , you did attempt to extort a rather large chunk of money
in exchange for your father &apos;s diary .
did you not ?
let me be frank here .
i don &apos;t like that your return has drawn charlotte
into an orbit of drugs , crime , and the threat of violence .
so i would appreciate it if , going forward ,
you would keep your distance from us .
that &apos;s not gonna be a problem .
good .
i must say that clarke girl is a lost cause .
did you hear any of that ?
enough to know that if you &apos;re seriously considering
a career shift towards politics ,
then you &apos;re missing an enormous opportunity .
nolan .
padma . hey , i was just headed out .
sorry . i know i &apos;m late .
i would &apos;ve been here earlier
if marco hadn &apos;t thrown a bunch of work at me .
strong move . why the face ?
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing , but earlier tonight ,
i overheard marco on the phone with daniel grayson .
they were talking about someone named carrie ann something .
the way he was talking gave me this paranoid thought
that he and daniel might be trying
to bring in hand @-@ picked personnel to undermine you ,
padma , i @-@ i really--i want to talk to you about this ,
but , uh , i am in the middle of ... a deal .
can you meet me back at the office in an hour ?
okay , but i ...
thanks .
you look beautiful !
permission to come aboard ?
charlotte , i &apos;m sorry .
i should &apos;ve called you back . i just ...
it &apos;s okay .
i know you were just trying to keep me out of danger .
now it &apos;s my turn to return the favor .
amanda told you about the ryans ?
listen , my dad said you can come stay at our house
until this whole mess is resolved .
i gotta stay put .
i got to . no one is coming in here
and just ripping away everything my dad worked so hard to give us .
and , hey , if jack and i are going down ,
it &apos;s not gonna be without one hell of a fight .
how much for the 9 millimeter ?
all yours for $ 350 .
this is worth five times that , at least .
my lucky day .
room for one more ?
i &apos;m more than a little
curious how it is you know so much about me .
well , other than your rampage against dmitri bladov ,
we know very little .
you pulled quite the vanishing act in the ensuing years .
try the phone .
it &apos;s dead .
yeah , no reception .
do you hear that ?
get down on the floor . now .
what can i say , vic ?
i hate to lose . always have .
you did outbid conrad for
that beautiful aston martin a few years ago .
yes , but at the time ,
i was coveting something far more beautiful .
truth is , i meant to impress you tonight .
unfortunately ,
grayson global &apos;s brash new c. e. o.
proved a more formidable opponent than i was prepared for .
oh , well , get used to it .
with the takeover of nolcorp ,
daniel &apos;s developed deep pockets and a big ego .
and soon , he &apos;s going to be adding a new feather in the company cap
with the acquisition of stonehaven united .
stonehaven ? interesting .
oh , my god .
jason , that &apos;s not public knowledge . loose lips .
victoria , please . it &apos;s already forgotten .
the only thing on my mind this evening is you .
well , i have to make the long ride home .
don &apos;t tell me i &apos;m gonna lose you , too .
on the contrary .
you &apos;re still very much in the race .
i want m &amp; a together first thing .
the target is stonehaven united solutions .
what is your interest in stonehaven united ?
don &apos;t say anything .
as long as you know what they need to know ,
they won &apos;t kill you .
bad advice .
next time the chamber will be loaded .
who hired you to spy on daniel grayson ?
go to hell .
wrong answer .
let &apos;s get this party started .
what do you want ?
to give you a chance ...
which is more than you deserve .
oh , yeah ? a chance to what ?
to get outta here before you bleed .
either you and your brother pack it up and leave tonight ...
or what , hmm ?
or you &apos;re gonna wish you &apos;d taken me up on my offer .
amanda . i &apos;ve been calling you .
excuse us .
yeah .
ashley , what are you doing here ?
jack &apos;s upstairs . he &apos;s waiting for you .
jack .
okay .
oh , my god .
oh , baby .
what happened ?
mr. grayson here made some kind of deal with the court .
they dropped the charges ?
no . uh , my co @-@ chair on the , uh ,
on the liberty project is friendly with the judge ,
so i just called in a favor .
and i asked the judge to set a lenient bail .
what made you change your mind ?
oh , well , i don &apos;t know . you know , as a citizen of some influence ,
i felt it was my duty to clean up police corruption
and drug trafficking in my own backyard .
and as a father , i was concerned about my daughter ...
and her sister .
cut the crap . what &apos;s in it for you ?
amanda .
no , no , no . that &apos;s all right .
she has every right to be suspicious about my motives .
and , yes , ms. clarke ,
i came to my senses and realized
that your predicament is my opportunity .
mr. grayson has decided to run for public office ,
and i suggested that helping you
and cleaning up police corruption in montauk
would be beneficial towards restoring his public profile .
that is , of course , if you &apos;ll accept my help
and my apology .
can we get a couple minutes ?
of course . yeah .
take all the time you need .
the only way to leave here alive is to cooperate .
you &apos;re wasting your time .
cooperate , and they &apos;ll kill you .
fine . you first .
you okay ?
yeah .
quickly . let &apos;s go .
wait .
no , now !
brava .
well , let &apos;s see if she buys it .
we need to split up . do you have a car nearby ?
uh , not far .
who were those guys ?
i have my suspicions .
good @-@ bye , mr. mathis .
you guys are back early .
what , your big date flame out ?
better question--
what are you doing here so late ?
this is when i get my best work done .
oh , would that be your work ... or daniel &apos;s ?
okay . this again .
nolan , what--what do i have to say to you ?
what--what can i do ?
you can stop embarrassing yourself .
every move that you &apos;ve made since you &apos;ve come back
has been about undermining me .
what have you been telling him ?
the truth , a concept that ...
continues to elude you .
check my e @-@ mails .
check my e @-@ mails . check every last communication i have made
since i started working here again .
don &apos;t mind if i do .
and since you would &apos;ve never run it through standard e @-@ mail ...
it would have to be a ghost .
not unlike this one , sent to daniel &apos;s personal e @-@ mail .
&quot; subject--missing r &amp; d.
&quot; n. r. will deny it ever existed .
don &apos;t take no for an answer . &quot;
it &apos;s the ghosts that get you .
nolan , look , i swear to you , i did not-- i did not write that .
look ...
get out . forever .
you &apos;re making a very big mistake .
how &apos;d we do ?
brilliant .
it was oscar @-@ worthy .
helen &apos;s on the hook ?
well , i &apos;m still alive , aren &apos;t i ?
look , we should , um ... we should celebrate .
oh , aiden , i would love to , but ...
i &apos;m expecting company .
emily , if--if our plan tonight worked ,
you shouldn &apos;t have to keep up this charade with daniel .
well , if it works .
until we know for sure , we stay the course .
and don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll control the situation with daniel .
fair enough .
every plan has a fatal flaw .
emily ?
sometimes it &apos;s the heart ...
how about a $ 1 @-@ million nightcap ?
even in those who are supposed to be the most careful .
but a careful nature doesn &apos;t always ensure success .
when a plan is built on an unstable foundation ...
failure is not only a possibility ,
it &apos;s a certainty .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re opening this with me .
ah , live for the moment , right ?
besides , you &apos;re worth it .
what shall we toast to ?
taking it slow and drinking it quickly .
oh , my goodness .
oh , it &apos;s gone bad .
oh , my goodness .
i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , what the hell ? it &apos;s for a good cause .
aiden .
excuse me .
i think i can guess what you &apos;re doing here .
yeah , i saw the lights were on .
uh , i thought i &apos;d fetch my things .
daniel .
aiden .
i hope i &apos;m not interrupting anything .
no , not really . um , it &apos;s fine .
here .
here .
i &apos;ll , uh , just take it that that &apos;s everything , then .
it is . trust me .
okay . night .
sorry .
no , i should--i should get going , too .
thank you for the wine , really .
that was a lovely gesture .
yeah . maybe we should quit while we &apos;re behind ...
for now .
yes .
it &apos;s me .
i have an update .
i have confirmation nolan ross
is hiding the carrion program somewhere inside the company .
good . we &apos;re counting on you .
