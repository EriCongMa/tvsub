daddy !
when i was a child ,
my father was framed for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
daddy !
amanda !
dad threw us a curveball .
i won &apos;t be fully vested in the company until i get married .
i love her , so why wait ?
you don &apos;t remember me , do you , amanda ?
should i ?
i interviewed you for my book about your father .
quite the collection .
hundreds of hours of one @-@ on @-@ one interviews .
no ! no !
victoria gave birth to a baby girl--charlotte .
ask her who the father is .
some say that our lives are defined
by the sum of our choices .
but it isn &apos;t really our choices that distinguish who we are .
it &apos;s our commitment to them .
victoria only came to the courtroom twice .
once for the day of her testimony ,
and then ... on the day that i was sentenced .
on that day , she brought the baby--
charlotte--
so beautiful .
her eyes were so familiar .
i barely heard the judge when he told me
that i would never leave this prison alive .
losing amanda was hard enough .
the thought of losing two daughters at once ,
it was ...
it was unbearable .
i think that &apos;s enough for today .
so charlotte grayson is your sister ?
if my father was right .
but what i don &apos;t understand is ,
why wouldn &apos;t he write that in his journals ?
why trust treadwell with that information and no one else ?
maybe he wasn &apos;t certain .
which is why i &apos;m gonna find out
or the graysons are gonna find out for me .
okay , i &apos;ll bite .
what are you gonna do with the tapes ?
one of them &apos;s gonna blow up victoria &apos;s divorce .
the other ones are gonna be found on amanda .
to frame her for torching casa treadwell ?
she didn &apos;t give me much choice .
so the fact that charlotte might be your sister
makes absolutely no difference to you ?
half sister , and ...
no , it doesn &apos;t .
what about jack ?
jack is in love with a killer .
i &apos;ve gotta get rid of amanda .
well , he thinks he &apos;s in love with you .
meanwhile , poor puppy dog daniel actually is .
so where , pray tell , does your heart stand in all this ?
my feelings are irrelevant .
look , i came here for revenge ,
and you offered to help .
if you can &apos;t stomach it anymore ,
then how about you at least spare me
your passive @-@ aggressive judgments ?
conrad &apos;s got a half dozen offshore entities
holding multicurrency bank accounts in denmark and spain .
you got a ballpark ?
$ 500 million give or take .
when were they established ?
within the last ten years .
making them community property
now that we voided the prenup .
there &apos;s something else he &apos;s withholding .
the s.e.c. is sniffing around ,
looking at the company &apos;s trading practices .
so there &apos;s a bit of a ticking clock
to get whatever liquid assets we can before a potential scandal blows up .
i told you , daniel would come through .
this should make today &apos;s mediation session all the more interesting .
victoria .
well , it looks like your father &apos;s deceit
is good news for both of us .
mm . how so ?
because thanks to you ,
i &apos;m poised to get what &apos;s rightfully mine ,
and you won &apos;t have go through your impetuous plan to marry emily .
mom ...
even if marrying her didn &apos;t activate my trust ,
i &apos;d still do it .
i love her , mom .
and if you truly care about my happiness ,
you &apos;ll find a way to love her , too .
heard you guys went to paint the town .
you made it back just before the storm .
how was atlantic city ?
went big , lost big .
emphasis on the lost ...
and the big .
what are you doing here ?
uh , well , amanda and i made plans
to go for breakfast last week .
wondered if you &apos;d forget .
you know how i feel about breakfast--
the most important meal of the day .
all right , well , you two go ahead and have fun .
okay , what &apos;s so important
that you couldn &apos;t wait until i was on dry land ?
mason treadwell &apos;s house burned to
the ground the night that you left town .
karma really is a bitch .
more like victoria grayson is .
i think she &apos;s the one who did it .
are you serious ? she doesn &apos;t exactly look like the type .
looks are always deceiving with victoria .
she despises treadwell and she despises you , too .
you need to leave town , lay low for a little while .
what ? why ?
because victoria hates me ,
and you &apos;re pretending to be me .
if she can burn down a house ,
she can definitely pin it on you ,
or worse ...
someone that you care about .
babe , we &apos;ve survived a lot worse than ms. moneybags .
and i can take care of myself ...
and jack .
declan .
look , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late .
you want to order something ?
uh , no . that &apos;s okay . i filled up on beer nuts .
it &apos;s the breakfast of champions .
do you want to tell him or can i ?
tell me what ?
charlotte and i were talking about the future ,
your future .
yeah , what about it ?
you &apos;ve been through a lot lately .
i know you lost your father
and that you and your brother struggle to make ends meet .
so how would you like to join charlotte
at collins prep this fall ?
i &apos;d love to ,
but ... i don &apos;t have the money
or the grades .
and what if i told you , the tuition &apos;s already paid for ?
the grades are up to you .
you &apos;ve made things easier for my daughter lately ,
and i just want to repay you
by making things a little easier for you .
and that &apos;s the deal ?
that is the deal .
mr. grayson .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
now all you have to do is pass the entrance exam .
that &apos;s amazing .
think you can pass ?
do you think i can pass ?
you &apos;re gonna .
i don &apos;t know what to say , sir . thank you .
seriously .
we &apos;re going to school together .
this is gonna be awesome .
let &apos;s get right to this , shall we ?
there have been some rather interesting discoveries
in our research into mr. grayson &apos;s finances .
there have also been some interesting discoveries
about your client &apos;s past indiscretions .
any infidelities my client may have participated in ,
from a legal standpoint , was voided
by your client &apos;s affair with ms. davis .
i &apos;m afraid we &apos;re talking about
a much more serious breach of trust here , ryan .
do you know the name of my favorite aunt ,
the one who raised me ?
well , victoria does .
on the day that she was supposed to testify ,
she fell ill .
weeks later , she gave birth to a baby girl .
she named her charlotte ,
same as my aunt .
i think that she did it to send me a message
that the little girl she was raising with conrad
is mine .
where did you get this ?
my dear ...
that &apos;s hardly the issue .
we will be ordering a paternity test .
and if charlotte isn &apos;t mine ,
i can assure you that the only way
you &apos;re gonna keep this from the media is to walk away
from this sham of marriage
with whatever i deign to give you ,
which won &apos;t include the grayson name , by the way .
when we &apos;re done with all of this ,
you &apos;re gonna be back to victoria harper ,
which is only fitting considering
you &apos;ll once again be the desperate ,
penniless little bitch you were
when i first met you .
you &apos;ve breached our disclosure contract , victoria ...
and not for the first time .
how do you expect me to represent you
when i can &apos;t even trust you ?
i told you , i had an affair .
but you didn &apos;t tell me it was with david clarke
or that charlotte could possibly be his daughter .
what are you doing ?
well , our late head of security had
a number of subcontractors he hired for various tasks .
looks like i &apos;m gonna be needing one of them .
for what ?
mason thinks that his tapes were destroyed in a fire ,
but i know damn well it was deliberately set
in order to cover the theft .
by whom ?
ashley .
please invite amanda clarke up this afternoon for tea .
do not take no for an answer .
charlotte ?
爱你的杰克
更爱你的阿曼达
emily ? what are you doing in here ?
jack , i--i &apos;m so sorry . i ... was looking for amanda .
okay .
she was , uh , she was summoned to the grayson manor
for tea with victoria .
really ? what &apos;s that about ?
well , given how much the graysons hated her dad ,
i &apos;d say nothing good .
after what that girl &apos;s been through ...
you really care about her , don &apos;t you ?
yeah .
thank you , by the way , for being so nice to her .
it means a lot .
i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll tell her you stopped by .
hey , jack .
be careful .
uh , the storm &apos;s coming in quickly .
the strawberries were picked fresh from my garden this morning .
mm . delicious .
so you &apos;re no longer allergic ?
i remember a company picnic
where one bite sent you straight to the emergency room .
your father was beside himself .
fortunately , i outgrew that .
well , then by all means , have some creme fraiche with it .
i love summer storms . don &apos;t you ?
not really .
let me be direct .
mason tells me , you claim
i had a relationship with david clarke .
you don &apos;t honestly believe that , do you ?
i remember what i remember .
which is ?
same as you , most likely .
well , i have to confess that after all these years ,
my memory is just a little bit foggy of those times .
you remembered my strawberry allergy just fine .
actually , when i come to think of it ,
i &apos;m not all that certain that little girl was you .
all right .
why don &apos;t you cut the crap
and tell me what i &apos;m really doing here ?
mason believes that you have some sort of vendetta against us .
and this dovetails very nicely with this uncanny sense i have
that his house didn &apos;t just burn down accidentally .
word on the street is , you lit that match
so you could pin it on me .
is that so ?
well , then maybe you should tell me
why you sent that tape to my husband .
is it money you &apos;re after ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
and apparently , neither do you .
sit down .
i don &apos;t take orders from you .
ryan .
okay . i &apos;m here right now .
the spoon .
i &apos;ll have the lab rush this right through .
there &apos;s no way that girl is david clarke &apos;s daughter .
well , we &apos;ll know soon enough .
victoria , i just got off the phone with conrad &apos;s lawyer .
the preliminary results from charlotte &apos;s d.n.a. test are in .
he &apos;s not the father .
knock , knock .
hey . sorry to interrupt .
your mom wanted me to let you know that
your dad &apos;s on his way over with his lawyer
in case you wanted to run for the hills .
okay , just , uh , just let her know i won &apos;t be here .
are you proposing to emily ?
don &apos;t say anything to my mother , all right ?
she doesn &apos;t need to know until emily says yes .
you think she will ?
well , after your lengthy courtship , who wouldn &apos;t ?
wow . you sound about as happy as my mom does .
what happened to being emily &apos;s best friend ?
daniel ...
you picked a really lovely ring .
despite the d.n.a. results ,
mr. grayson has no intention of voiding charlotte &apos;s trust fund .
how very generous of you .
she &apos;s not to blame , after all .
she does realize that means we &apos;re done
with the idea of mediation ?
you really want a protracted trial ?
you know you &apos;ll both be skewered in the media .
no , somehow i think it &apos;s my soon @-@ to @-@ be ex @-@ wife
who &apos;s gonna draw the most unflattering spotlight .
i need to speak with her in private .
that might not be the best idea .
no , i would advise against that .
it &apos;s not a request .
must you drag charlotte into all this ?
me ?
that &apos;s rich .
here are your options , and they are limited--
&quot; a , &quot; you accept the pittance i &apos;m prepared to offer you
in exchange for avoiding a trial
or &quot; b , &quot; we take this to court ,
and it becomes common knowledge that charlotte
is the daughter of the most hated in america ,
meaning you had a torrid love affair
with a terrorist .
david clarke was no terrorist ,
and he was twice the man you ever were .
well , you &apos;re gonna have a very hard time
convincing the rest of the world of that .
so what &apos;s it gonna be , victoria , &quot; a &quot; or &quot; b &quot; ?
i did everything you asked for ,
and now you &apos;re prepared to throw your children to the wolves
and leave me with nothing
all because of your wounded pride ?
i &apos;ll instruct barbara to send over my final proposal .
reject it , and whatever happens to charlotte
will be on your hands .
bloody hell .
it &apos;s a little early to be lighting all the candles .
what , you &apos;re afraid i &apos;m gonna burn the place down ?
okay , okay . look ...
you &apos;ve been like this ever since
your tea with victoria .
you gonna tell me what happened ?
the bitch practically accused me
of burning down treadwell &apos;s house .
that &apos;s what happened .
she what ? that &apos;s insane .
yeah , what &apos;s even more insane
is that emily tried to warn me she &apos;d do it .
i should &apos;ve listened to her from the beginning .
beginning of what ?
oh , great job buddy .
crap . sorry .
do you have a dovetail or anything ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
okay .
hey ...
chatty cathy .
zip it .
jack can &apos;t know about anything that emily &apos;s told you .
she &apos;s barely told me anything .
i &apos;m practically as in the dark as jack is .
well , listen , emily &apos;s been nothing but good to you .
really ? a few days ago ,
emily earwigs me into getting all up in mason &apos;s grill ,
and then coincidentally , his house burns to the ground ?
great questions ... for emily .
so till you get some answers ,
keep jack out of it .
hey , daddy .
declan &apos;s so blown away by your offer
that we &apos;ve spent the entire day prepping for the exams .
oh , no . what &apos;s wrong ?
uh , well , charlotte , we need to talk .
what &apos;d she do this time ?
oh , no . it &apos;s just , um ...
i &apos;m going to be making some changes
over the next few weeks .
it &apos;s the end of the summer ,
and things are heating up for me at the office
so i &apos;m gonna be going back and forth to the city more and more .
so what does that mean ?
i &apos;m saying , it &apos;s not practical
for you to stay with me .
but i &apos;m supposed to live with you .
i thought you were buying another house here .
oh , i know that was the plan , but i think it &apos;s best
if you go back to your mother &apos;s .
i can &apos;t stand her , daddy . you know that .
then you need to work on that .
you &apos;re not a child anymore , charlotte .
it &apos;s time you start growing up .
okay , just a little further .
you recognize where we are ?
it &apos;s where i spilled my drink on your jacket .
you really kept it .
man of my word .
well , so much for good first impressions .
that was a perfect impression ,
as was your second and your third .
you know , most men in this town
would &apos;ve thrown me off the boat .
you were ... so sweet about it .
you know , most people look at me
and see me for someone i &apos;m not .
and i spent the first part of my life
either disappointing them or worse ...
living up to their expectations .
you &apos;re the first person
that i could be my true self around .
lucky me .
i know we haven &apos;t known each other for very long ,
and we &apos;ve had to deal with some
pretty unexpected things in a short amount of time .
sort of like this weather .
you think one storm &apos;s passed ,
and another one &apos;s on the horizon ...
which is why i &apos;m
sure about the way i feel for you ,
&apos;cause as long as i have you ...
i &apos;m not stopping .
good .
no one &apos;s ever made me feel as loved
and as safe and understood as you do .
if you let me ...
i &apos;d like to spend the rest of my life
making you as happy as you &apos;ve made me .
emily thorne ,
will you marry me ?
yes .
if only i could &apos;ve controlled the weather .
perfectly romantic .
romance is never perfect .
but don &apos;t let me rain on anyone &apos;s parade .
mom , hi . sorry . we were just ...
it &apos;s obvious what you were doing , sweetheart .
hello , emily .
victoria .
oh , you two look like coconspirators .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve ...
yet , i see that you have .
mom , we were just coming to give you some good news .
oh , and what news is that ?
victoria , um ...
mom ...
did you tell your father ?
i &apos;m sure he will be thrilled .
no , you &apos;re the first ,
then charlotte , then dad .
oh , come on , mom . be happy for us .
congratulations .
ashley davenport ...
slumming it .
vodka soda , please .
house is fine .
you got it .
house vodka ? ash , talk to me .
well , if you must know ,
i &apos;ve basically shunned my best friend all summer
in favor of worming my way aboard
the &quot; s.s. queen victoria &quot;
only to find out that it &apos;s a sinking ship .
how so ?
all i &apos;ve got to show for my summer with the graysons
is a gun @-@ wielding psychotic ex @-@ boyfriend
who made out with you .
meanwhile , emily gets an engagement ring
and the keys to the kingdom .
wait . emily ... said yes ?
according to her text .
i &apos;m gonna go to the loo and drown myself in it .
it &apos;s back there .
did i hear that right ?
i &apos;m afraid you did .
you wanna pour another one for yourself ,
my treat ?
i &apos;m on the clock .
what time you done ?
maybe i can give you a ride home .
i am home .
i live upstairs .
even more convenient .
with my boyfriend .
you enjoy your drink .
hello , dad .
where &apos;s charlotte ?
she wasn &apos;t in her room .
i sent her home .
home ? why ?
because that &apos;s where she belongs .
why do you need her ?
i &apos;ve asked emily to marry me .
she said yes .
i see .
and is ms. thorne at all aware
that she &apos;s just part of a scheme for you
to get your hands on your share of the company ?
see , i &apos;m not half the fool
your mother has clearly painted me out to be .
okay , okay , look , i know that you &apos;re bitter over everything
that &apos;s happened between you and mom .
bitter doesn &apos;t even begin to cover it .
but assuming you were ever in love ,
there has to be a part of you
that still remembers how you felt when you first met her .
that &apos;s how i feel about emily .
you &apos;re right .
i fell in love with her , daniel .
and i fell hard .
my first marriage was already a disaster
when i walked into that little art gallery in the village
and i saw your mother for the first time .
and , yeah , i &apos;m sure i felt about her then
the same way you think you feel about emily now .
except i &apos;d never treat emily the way you &apos;re treating mom .
no , no , no , you say that ,
but you &apos;ll be at each other &apos;s throat in the end .
you &apos;ll see .
you &apos;ll cheat on her , she &apos;ll cheat on you ,
and then one day , you &apos;ll find out
she &apos;s been keeping a secret so big ,
it &apos;ll destroy your whole family .
what secret ?
wh @-@ what are you talking about ?
well , you know , you &apos;re so cozy with your mommy ,
why don &apos;t you let her tell you ?
charlotte .
i &apos;m sorry to bother you . i was looking for daniel .
and he was looking for you .
he went to the southfork inn .
is everything okay ?
my dad just kicked me out .
i have no idea what i did .
everything was fine , he offered to pay for declan &apos;s school ,
and then just out of the blue ...
i &apos;ve just never seen him look at me that way before .
what way ?
the way he looks at my mom .
oh , my god . emily ...
did daniel propose ?
yeah . he wanted to tell you himself .
is that okay ?
you have no idea how badly i &apos;ve always wanted a sister .
at this late an hour , you must be bearing bad news .
that depends .
the lab compared amanda &apos;s d.n.a. samples to charlotte &apos;s .
and ?
they &apos;re a match .
they &apos;re definitely half sisters .
that means she really is amanda clarke .
i don &apos;t believe it .
there is something more serious
i need to discuss with you , victoria .
about my services and your legal affairs .
allow me to help you , mr. huntley .
you &apos;re fired .
what the hell are you doing ?
you don &apos;t want to mess with me , bro .
i was just leaving .
no , you &apos;re not going--
you shoulda listened .
jack , are you up there ?
jack , is everything okay ?
oh , my god .
jack . jack . oh , no . no .
what happened ?
jack got the crap beat out of him .
he stumbled upon some guy rifling through amanda &apos;s stuff .
looking for , presumably ,
a set of hi8 videotapes .
victoria did this .
no .
you did this when you planted treadwell &apos;s tapes .
i never meant for jack to get hurt .
how much collateral damage are you willing to accept ?
i may have jack &apos;s blood all over my jacket ,
but you &apos;ve got it all over your hands .
i have something i need to do .
yeah .
don &apos;t you always ?
nice ring .
i told you jack porter was off @-@ limits .
what happened ?
victoria called in her own guy .
there was nothing i could do .
you were supposed to control it .
they got to you , didn &apos;t they ?
no . your father did .
i told him his best shot at a new trial
would mean pulling you in .
he refused .
he was afraid of what the conspiracy might do
to keep you silenced .
you &apos;re lucky i intercepted
that d.n.a. test she ordered on amanda .
if i hadn &apos;t switched the sample , you &apos;d be finished .
i know .
thank you .
you know i believe your father is innocent ,
but i can &apos;t be part of this kind of violence .
maybe it &apos;s time you reassess what you &apos;re doing here .
i &apos;m so sorry , jack .
we need to talk .
no kidding .
i &apos;ve got about a jillion questions for you .
i know you &apos;ve been keeping secrets from me .
you have about five seconds to start talking .
the graysons framed my father .
they were responsible for that plane going down .
they set him up to take the fall .
are you serious ?
while i was rotting away in juvie with you
and my father was rotting away in federal prison ,
the graysons were sitting in that house ,
living their lives , spending their money , raising their kids ,
like nothing ever happened .
so that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
i came back to avenge my father &apos;s death ,
and to take everything away from them .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i @-@ if you would &apos;ve told me , i--
because i didn &apos;t want something like this to happen .
the graysons hired that guy who beat up jack .
and now you &apos;re both in danger .
they did this to him ?
you need to go to save yourself ...
and jack ...
and if you care too ... me .
you know i &apos;d do anything for you .
this is your new cell phone .
i &apos;m gonna need your old one .
your fake i.d. and passport are in your bag .
that just leaves ...
jack .
i can &apos;t say good @-@ bye to him .
then i &apos;ll do it for you .
you &apos;re up late .
how did your father take the news ?
he took it like you &apos;d expect .
except he said something else that ...
i can &apos;t get out of my head .
oh , what &apos;s that ?
well , basically , the reason why he &apos;s being so nasty
is because of some secret you &apos;ve been keeping .
oh , we all have secrets , daniel .
mom ... it &apos;s me .
all right ? so whatever it is ,
you don &apos;t have to keep me in the dark .
well , the truth is inevitable , daniel ,
and i do want to tell you myself .
but i just don &apos;t want you to think less of me .
oh , that &apos;s impossible , mom .
just tell me .
it &apos;s about your sister .
okay .
well , what-- what about her ?
conrad &apos;s not her father .
who &apos;s charlotte &apos;s father ?
d @-@ d @-@ david clarke .
all i wanted to ...
was to protect charlotte from the truth .
that &apos;s all i wanted .
what did he do to you , mom ?
please . i can &apos;t talk about this .
i can &apos;t .
oh , my god .
oh , my god , mom . come here .
i &apos;m sorry , baby . i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , god , mom . i am so sorry .
is this seat taken ?
it &apos;s a free beach .
amanda &apos;s gone .
yeah , well , kudos to you .
looks like the ends finally justified the means .
or should i say meanness ?
are you finished ?
i don &apos;t know .
are you ?
i &apos;ll never be finished .
but after what happened to jack , i ...
i think it &apos;s clear that i need to minimize the fallout
from what i &apos;m doing .
i think it &apos;s a good time to press &quot; pause &quot; on all of this .
and do what ?
regroup .
maybe there &apos;s a better way to level victoria
than by marrying her son .
and ... what do you plan to do with daniel ?
i &apos;m gonna give him his ring back .
tell him that ...
i need to give marrying into his family
some more thought ...
which is actually kind of true .
for once .
baby steps .
don &apos;t do that .
hey , you &apos;re up , finally .
ohh . where &apos;s amanda ?
she &apos;s gone , jack .
what do you mean , gone ?
让我知道有扇家门永远为我敞开 -爱你的阿曼达
i don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;m so sorry , man .
where--where-- where would she go ?
charlotte ?
where were you this morning ?
walking on the beach .
oh , sweetheart ...
i know how much what your father &apos;s done has hurt you ,
but i &apos;m so happy you &apos;ve come back home .
let &apos;s talk about it .
no .
charlotte , please ,
please-- mom , just don &apos;t .
未怀孕
i told them we were retiring for the evening .
but we do have to give our statements in the morning .
are you okay ?
of course not .
what we did was despicable .
but necessary . you know that .
i love you , victoria .
i know that , too .
conrad ...
i can &apos;t bear being alone right now .
will you stay with me tonight ?
i &apos;d like that very much .
for some , commitment is like faith ...
a chosen devotion to another person or an intangible ideal .
but for me , commitment has a shadow side ,
a darker drive that constantly asks the question ...
how far am i willing to go ?
i woke up , and you were gone again .
we &apos;re gonna have to do something about that .
well , you crawled into bed so late ,
i thought i &apos;d let you sleep a bit .
i know . i--i &apos;m sorry . i should--
i should &apos;ve never gone to see my dad .
i should &apos;ve stayed with you .
is everything okay ?
i found out why my parents &apos; divorce is so contentious .
turns out my dad
isn &apos;t really charlotte &apos;s father .
oh , my god , daniel .
and that &apos;s not even the worst of it .
her biological father is that madman
who used to live in your house--
