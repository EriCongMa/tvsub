but i &apos;m not coming home . i &apos;m gonna live here with cortney .
i &apos;ve got a kid and a husband who &apos;s suing for full custody
because i &apos;m an unfit mother .
can i help you ?
sheila .
you adopted kyle ?
kyle is in prison .
are you worried i still have feelings for gabe ?
do you ?
god &apos;s gonna send me the boyfriend i want
when the time is right .
why did you bring me here ?
i thought you &apos;d like it .
really ? it didn &apos;t have anything to do
with the fact that noah &apos;s gay ?
i &apos;m aaron .
cameron .
i &apos;ve been interning at the juvenile justice project .
they help minors who were given unfair trials .
you look really handsome .
you are like a foot taller since i last saw you .
and his voice is like an octave lower .
no , it isn &apos;t .
oh , lord .
pizza &apos;s here !
hi , guys , so good to see you . glad you could make it !
oh , thank you .
and my baby daughter &apos;s 40th birthday party !
i wouldn &apos;t miss it for the world ,
although i suppose it means i &apos;m finally old .
you &apos;ve been old for a while , dear .
hey , sweetheart , how are you holding up ?
i &apos;m fine .
your mom told us about that boy , nick .
you were very brave .
i &apos;m just glad it &apos;s over .
yeah , you know , i &apos;m thinking
that we should cancel our room at the hotel
and spend the whole weekend here .
why ?
well , we could spend more time with our grandkids .
is it okay ?
yeah , they could stay in brandon &apos;s room .
and where would brandon sleep ?
jesus .
what ? he doesn &apos;t live here anymore .
i &apos;m sorry , where does brandon live ?
with his married girlfriend and her three @-@ year @-@ old son .
mariana .
she &apos;s , um ...
getting a divorce .
well , then , so long as she &apos;s getting a divorce .
why on earth would you allow brandon to move in
with an older woman and her child ?
she &apos;s hardly an older woman .
and believe me , we &apos;re not allowing him , he &apos;s 18 .
oh , sorry . found the ... air mattress .
are we gonna meet this girlfriend
at your birthday party ?
actually , i &apos;m not sure .
brandon says she doesn &apos;t think she &apos;d be welcome .
perceptive girl .
so you don &apos;t approve ?
it &apos;s not that we don &apos;t approve of her .
we just ... don &apos;t approve of the situation ,
but we don &apos;t want to push brandon away .
well , how much further can he get ?
actually , i was thinking you should
invite cort to the party , personally .
me ? why me ?
because it &apos;s my 40th birthday party
and i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m not the one she &apos;s afraid of .
um , dana , i really don &apos;t think
this is going to fit in here comfortably .
sweetheart , just set it up in the living room .
stewart can sleep down there .
okay .
hold on .
okay .
mom .
something going on with you and daddy ?
turns out there &apos;s a reason that your father
doesn &apos;t want to be alone with me in a hotel room ,
and it has nothing to do
with spending more time with his grandchildren .
he &apos;s having an affair .
what , piano lessons ? really ?
dang , you must be desperate for money , huh ?
yeah , kinda .
rent &apos;s coming up , and , of course ,
divorce is gonna cost a ton , so ...
how much ?
5,000 bucks .
holy ...
yep .
good thing that &apos;s not your problem , huh ?
yeah .
高中生急需高考辅导
okay , so i have some good news .
we got a c @-@ stem grant ,
which means we now have enough money
to enter the regional robotics competition .
huh ? how does that sound ?
now , we have a ton of building and programming to do ,
but first we have to figure out
which three of you will lead us
onto the field of battle ,
as driver , strategist , and shooter .
any takers ?
is this ... we want this ?
yes , we want this .
no girls have ever represented anchor beach behind the glass .
just put your hand up .
... a little friendly competition .
you have 24 hours to build a robot
that can pick up this block and dump it into this basket .
the club will then vote for a winner
based on speed , design , and creativity .
you &apos;ll be working together in teams of three ,
so ... choose wisely .
all right , good luck .
right now .
wow , didn &apos;t see that coming .
wanna join us ?
so , this , uh , boyfriend of yours ...
you don &apos;t talk about him very much .
yeah , i &apos;m not really the type of girl
to talk about her boyfriend a lot .
i see , but , uh ... that &apos;s it ?
it &apos;s not because he doesn &apos;t actually exist ?
no , he exists , trust me .
if you say so .
&apos;course , uh , some people say big foot exists ,
but i won &apos;t believe it until i see it with my own eyes .
go ahead .
hey , kyle .
god , it &apos;s been a long time , huh ?
hey , callie .
you look good .
thanks for coming to see me .
i don &apos;t get a lot of visitors ,
except my mom .
and it &apos;s hard on her seeing me in here .
of course .
i would have come sooner if i had known .
sorry , this is aaron .
he works at the juvenile justice center .
i &apos;m an intern .
oh , cool ...
they take on cases like yours ,
where a minor might not have gotten a fair trial .
you ... you think you can help me ?
uh , well , we got to find something
to get them to open the case back up .
we talked to your mom ,
and she said that there was a witness ,
an alibi witness , who your lawyer never contacted .
yeah , um ... patrick molloy .
he worked at the rec center .
that &apos;s where i was the afternoon that mrs. johnson was killed .
you know i didn &apos;t do it , right ?
i mean , i would never have hurt her .
she was always really nice to me .
i believe you .
hey , baby .
hey ! daddy , what ... what are you doing here ?
well , i just needed to talk to you
without your mother around .
got a minute ?
so , what did you get ?
on my sat ? uh , 1450 .
nice .
so when are you taking the test ? because i was thinking ...
it &apos;s tomorrow .
isn &apos;t that a little late for a tutor ?
well , yeah , but , you know ,
i was kind of thinking that you could take it for me .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t do that .
look , i &apos;ll pay you .
a thousand bucks , cash .
so , why didn &apos;t you sign in at the rec center that day ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess i just forgot .
but i was there .
it was raining , we were all inside .
i was watching the game with patrick .
we were yelling at the refs ,
&apos;cause griffin kept getting fouled
and they weren &apos;t calling it .
do you know if he still works there ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m sure we can track him down .
you think if he says i was there
i might get a new trial ?
maybe .
hey , i brought you a book .
they said they &apos;d give it to you .
《 sideways stories from wayside school 》 , remember it ?
yeah . we loved that book .
i must have read it 10 times .
except jude , jude ...
hated it , yeah .
how is jude ?
he &apos;s good .
he &apos;s tall .
no way .
he &apos;s like taller than me now .
wow !
time &apos;s up , kyle .
i &apos;ll come see you again .
i won &apos;t be here .
i turn 18 next month , so ...
they &apos;re moving me to folsom prison .
we &apos;ll talk to molloy . we &apos;ll find him .
just hang on , okay ?
so dad is not having an affair .
told ya .
he &apos;s been sneaking around
&apos;cause he &apos;s putting together this video
for mom &apos;s retirement party .
honest to god , made me want to cry .
he &apos;s got everyone sending these little video clips
saying nice things about her .
isn &apos;t that the sweetest thing you ever heard ?
yeah , it is .
so , what do i do ?
do i tell her that &apos;s what he &apos;s been up to
so she stops acting so paranoid ?
well , kind of ruins the surprise , doesn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s true .
okay , i &apos;m just going to stay out of it .
it &apos;s usually for the best where my parents are concerned , anyway .
did you know that many of the british codebreakers
during world war ii were women ?
as were many of the first nasa mathematicians and engineers .
seriously ?
not that you &apos;d ever read about them in the history books .
it &apos;s still a man &apos;s world .
well , in stem club it is , anyway .
which , my dears , is why you need to kick those boys &apos; asses .
oh , we will , gram .
okay . so here &apos;s an idea .
everyone else is gonna design their robots
to scoop up the blocks , right ?
well , what if we used these instead ?
we could attach the zip ties to the pipes ,
arrange them vertically ,
and if we could program the pipes to spin around fast enough ...
it acts like a vacuum .
we &apos;d win for sure .
that &apos;s kind of brilliant .
but no way the ties can lift the block .
what if you used these instead ?
we don &apos;t need a boy &apos;s help .
yeah , and how do you suppose that we attach this around this ?
fine . so , uh , you wanna hang ?
i &apos;m kind of busy here , jesus .
yeah , boy toy , run along .
okay , we &apos;re making a video for mama &apos;s party .
like the party that &apos;s tomorrow ?
yes , and i need you to edit it for me .
well , i can &apos;t .
and shouldn &apos;t you have gotten on this
like weeks ago ?
yes , mariana i should have , but i just thought of it now .
okay , well ... get jude to do it .
do what ?
mama &apos;s birthday video .
i just need one of my computer @-@ savvy children
who loves me
to help me put it together . what do you say ?
okay . i can try .
really ?
i &apos;ve never edited anything , but ...
i might know someone who can help .
yeah ? - who ?
noah .
hi . brandon just left .
that &apos;s okay , i actually wanted to talk to you ,
if that would be all right .
yeah , um , come in .
sorry .
that &apos;s all right .
we were just playing earlier .
how you doing ?
good . how are you ?
good .
i &apos;m well , thanks .
i wanted to invite you to lena &apos;s birthday party .
it would mean a lot to her
and to me , of course , if you would come .
um , so , it &apos;s a &apos; 70s theme party .
don &apos;t know how quickly you can get together
a pair of bellbottoms on such short notice ,
but it would be great if you could come .
thank you . yeah .
i &apos;d love to come .
great ! okay .
sorry , this is work . do you mind ?
no , no , sure , no problem .
hello ?
布兰登 · 福斯特
hi . are you patrick molloy ?
yes .
hi , i &apos;m callie adams foster ,
and this is aaron baker .
we talked to a friend of yours at the rec center ,
said we could find you here .
okay .
we &apos;re friends of kyle snow .
do you remember him ?
yeah . he killed that lady , right ?
he was found guilty ,
but we don &apos;t think he was given a fair trial .
kyle says he was with you at the rec center
on the day that mrs. johnson was murdered .
and you were watching a clippers game .
do you remember that ?
yeah , i do .
it was raining , so all the kids were inside .
it was crazy .
but i ...
i don &apos;t remember kyle being there .
are you sure ?
he said that you were complaining about the refs ?
sorry .
would it have been possible
for a kid to be at the rec center and forget to sign in ?
yeah , sure . i mean , if it was busy
and nobody noticed , that could happen .
okay , thank you .
he was a nice kid .
i wish i could help .
thanks .
look , it was four years ago .
it &apos;s possible he just doesn &apos;t remember seeing kyle ,
but it doesn &apos;t mean that he wasn &apos;t there .
i just really thought for a second
i guess nothing &apos;s ever that simple .
or fair .
well , maybe there &apos;s something else .
another hole in the case .
listen , you don &apos;t have to do this .
maybe i want to .
i really do have a boyfriend .
okay . i really do want to help .
i &apos;ve been in juvie twice .
it was pretty awful .
but folsom , it &apos;s gotta be hell .
just don &apos;t know if he &apos;ll make it .
what can i say about lena ? she &apos;s perfect .
and it &apos;s weird because that is usually something
i hate in a person .
i mean , really , what &apos;s more ho--
she &apos;s a trip .
you have no idea .
okay , so you just wanna move the cursor to where you want the cut
and then you can dissolve or fade or whatever .
hey , thanks for showing me all this .
no problem .
i do this kind of stuff for my church all the time .
what ?
nothing .
no , what ?
i was online and ...
i saw that connor &apos;s in san diego .
did he tell you he &apos;s coming ?
who &apos;s connor ?
he &apos;s , uh , my ex ... boyfriend .
he moved to l.a. , so we broke up .
hey , did you find something strong enough
to lift your cube with ?
no , we &apos;re trying something else .
what if you don &apos;t have to ?
i figured why go around the pipe
if you could go through it ?
19 seconds . that &apos;s the time to beat .
you &apos;re next .
what ?
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
we got this .
you ready ?
nine seconds . that &apos;s great .
i &apos;m sorry , did you say something earlier ?
i didn &apos;t think so .
yeah .
name ?
tristan chacones .
good luck .
thank you .
so , i &apos;ve tallied all the votes ,
combined that with the points earned for speed ,
and ... we have a winner .
aiden , dan , and jeffrey .
um , our robot completed the task in less than half the time ,
and it couldn &apos;t have done that
without the superior design and creativity .
true , but those are subjective assessments .
maybe , but ours was also autonomous .
that &apos;s worth double the points in competition .
if anchor beach is gonna beat these bigger schools ,
we can &apos;t do it with the same designs
and same old strategies .
we &apos;ve gotta be different .
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
and i apologize .
i &apos;m overturning the club &apos;s decision .
are you serious ?
look , i get it ,
but you should have voted for them in the first place ,
and you know that .
oh , my god !
congratulations .
really ?
way to play the girl card .
brandon ?
hey ! brandon !
damn ! oh , my god .
come here . give me some sugar .
watch the lips .
that lipstick took me a half @-@ hour , believe it or not .
oh , come on now .
oh , will you get that ?
yeah .
hello .
uh , no , i don &apos;t think so .
honey , did you order a house appraisal ?
no . why would i get our house appraised ?
uh , sorry , i think there must be some mistake .
oh , uh , probably my fault .
uh , we &apos;ll have to call you back .
you &apos;re getting our house appraised ?
i completely forgot to mention it . my apology .
dana and i are switching financial advisors ,
and we &apos;re restructuring our trust
and putting all our ducks in a row ,
for retirement , you know .
okay .
and this new guy , he wants a complete list
of all of our assets and our obligations
and that includes the house ,
because i &apos;m co @-@ borrower on the loan ,
so he &apos;s probably just being overly thorough ,
that &apos;s all .
stop it . where is the bar ?
oh , okay , i &apos;m not gonna lie .
i kind of can &apos;t wait for my mom to eat a little crow
when she finds out why my dad &apos;s been acting so weird .
i &apos;m just confused . why would he list our house as an asset ?
uh , i guess because technically it is .
well ...
you like ?
i love !
you didn &apos;t have to do all this .
you only turn 40 once , baby .
mr. saturday night fever himself !
成为迪斯科舞蹈获奖者的故事
look at that !
ironic , given the fact that i don &apos;t really dance .
hey , i get one birthday wish ,
and it &apos;s to see you do the hustle .
well , that &apos;s sad , but for you , i &apos;ll do it .
be careful what you wish for &apos; cause i &apos;ve seen it .
you invited gabe ?
yeah , he &apos;s been here all week working ,
so lena thought it would be nice to invite him .
you know ?
don &apos;t get to the gym much , huh ?
so that &apos;s why he didn &apos;t tell me he was in san diego .
he came with his new boyfriend .
gross .
the least he could have done is told me
instead of letting me find out like this .
hey , you made it .
of course .
all right , cuteness overload .
you two , get together .
come on .
really ? it &apos;s not too ...
debbie harry ?
70年代朋克摇滚风
i have no idea who that is .
all i know is i like what i see .
back atcha , stud .
did you hear that we beat the boys in stem today ?
yeah , mariana practically called a press conference .
well , we couldn &apos;t have done it without your help .
perhaps i could do a little something for you .
you know , to thank you ?
yeah , yeah , i can probably think of something .
and also , maybe , i could start tutoring you again .
wait , what ?
so you can get a head start for the sats .
i don &apos;t want this to be weird .
i mean , it &apos;s not weird for me .
no , i totally agree . it doesn &apos;t have to be weird at all .
so ...
you seeing anybody ?
uh , yeah , i &apos;m dating .
oh , hell no !
it &apos;s my ex ,
with some barely pubescent girlfriend .
excuse me .
no , no , no , no !
i &apos;m not gonna be the only people on the dance floor .
come on , look .
i &apos;ve been watching those old soul train videos on youtube .
have you ?
let me show you what i got .
hey , guys .
what ?
no , it &apos;s a nice perm .
oh , he &apos;s greg brady .
it was her idea .
who &apos;s greg brady ?
hey , uh , be right back .
okay .
在家吗
uh , excuse me .
hey , so i just wanted to thank you
for inviting cort .
it meant a lot to her .
and me .
of course , yeah .
okay , well , i &apos;m gonna go tell mama happy birthday .
bye .
okay , so why don &apos;t you like her ?
she seems nice enough , i guess .
she &apos;s taken advantage of him .
how so ?
lena doesn &apos;t know this and i didn &apos;t want to ruin her party ,
but ...
she &apos;s ...
he &apos;s using his money to pay her bills .
what bills ?
so , thank you for inviting all of my exes .
i thought i was the one who got you in the divorce .
sorry .
hey , how &apos;d it go today ? the sats .
i saw you when i was picking up garrett .
uh , yeah , i think it went pretty well .
you took the sats today ?
uh , yeah , um ...
you know , i just wanted to take it again
and see if i could improve my scores .
god , i practically had to bribe garrett
to get him to take it even once .
all rightie .
i am going to go get a refill .
uh , anyone ?
okay .
hey .
nice get @-@ up .
oh , no , we &apos;re having a costume party
for my mom &apos;s birthday .
oh , sorry , i can leave .
no ,
i was actually trying to stay off the dance floor ,
so come in .
so , what &apos;s up ?
kyle &apos;s lawyer did speak to patrick molloy .
four years ago . these are his notes .
molloy said he remembered seeing kyle at the rec center
on march 23rd &apos; cause they were watching
the clippers @-@ warriors game together ,
just like kyle said .
wha ... where did you find this ?
remember sheila told us
that she had all of kyle &apos;s old files in the garage ?
i did a little digging through them , and there it was .
oh , my god , thank you .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
hey , um ... aj , this is aaron .
aaron , this is aj , my boyfriend .
hey .
so you do exist .
look at them . god .
she does know little miss stripy pants
only makes her look older , doesn &apos;t she ?
i don &apos;t get it .
yeah , i &apos;m actually gonna go ...
ooh ! now , that , on the other hand , mm !
if i weren &apos;t gay , i &apos;d climb him like a jungle gym .
you coming ?
uh , nah , i &apos;m gonna sit this one out .
mm , not me .
mom , come dance with me and daddy .
he can &apos;t ask me himself ?
this is silly .
mom , dad is not having an affair .
he &apos;s just busy with retirement
and restructuring the trust
and getting a new business manager .
there &apos;s a lot on his plate .
what new business manager ? what are you talking about ?
he didn &apos;t tell me anything about all that .
so , you &apos;re doing okay , after everything that happened with nick ?
yeah , uh , i &apos;m fine . i just ...
i kind of wish people would stop asking me .
okay , good .
but you and mat , you &apos;re back together , right ?
where is he ?
we are . uh , college tour .
speaking of getting back together ...
did you ever think maybe ...
you and gabe ?
&apos;cause i mean it would kind of be crazy romantic .
don &apos;t let mike hear you say that .
why ?
oh , my god , are ...
you and mike like &quot; a thing &quot; ?
maybe ?
oh , is that okay ?
yeah , of course , i love mike .
me too .
you &apos;re in love .
i haven &apos;t told him yet .
our secret , i promise .
hello . you must be cortney .
i &apos;m brandon &apos;s grandmother , dana adams .
oh , it &apos;s so nice to meet you , mrs. adams .
i &apos;ve heard so much about you .
really ? and all i know about you is that
you &apos;re a young married mother
allowing your high @-@ school @-@ age boyfriend
to pay for your divorce .
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s a little weird
that my mom didn &apos;t know anything about my dad
getting them a new business manager ?
i don &apos;t know , love .
maybe he &apos;s the one that handles the finances .
that &apos;s what kelly did .
right before she left me .
she started moving money around and hiding it .
if i were paying more attention ,
i would have known she was gonna divorce me .
hey , why aren &apos;t you dancing ?
i don &apos;t know .
just too dumb , i guess .
so , how could molloy forget
giving this statement to kyle &apos;s lawyer ?
maybe he didn &apos;t . maybe he changed his story .
why would he do that ?
could be anything .
maybe he was being intimidated by someone .
like who ?
i don &apos;t know . a prosecutor ?
or maybe he was protecting someone .
like if he had something to hide .
all right , you young people , i know that the &apos; 70s
is probably just a chapter in your history books ,
but the dance floor beckons , huh , let &apos;s go !
don &apos;t have to tell me twice . i &apos;ll see you out there .
yeah , i &apos;ll be out in a second .
and who is this ?
i &apos;m aaron , mrs. adams foster .
oh , aaron who took my daughter for a ride
on his motorcycle aaron .
yeah .
um , we were just looking at a few of kyle &apos;s case files ,
and we found this guy , this witness , who changed his story .
do you think you could check him out , see if he has a record ?
sure . when it &apos;s not mama &apos;s birthday , all right ?
you &apos;re welcome to stay , aaron .
oh , thanks , but i should probably head out .
okay .
sorry .
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t tell me .
what ?
so , what are we calling you guys ?
judah ?
maybe juno ?
um ... juno ?
well , if you &apos;re changing your relationship status ,
you &apos;ve got to come up with a couple name , right ?
are you cheating on mom ?
what ? no !
then why does she think you are ?
are you planning on leaving her ?
why doesn &apos;t she know about the new business manager , dad ?
what are you two talking about ?
dana , honey , i &apos;m not cheating on you .
who said you were ?
mom .
okay , there is something that i &apos;ve been keeping from you .
both of you .
are you okay , dad ?
noah , please , don &apos;t go .
look , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on with you and your ex ,
but , dude , leave me out of it .
i &apos;m really sorry .
i didn &apos;t want him to think i was sitting around and ...
crying about him or something .
i get wanting to make him feel jealous .
but i hate social media .
why ?
a lot of people don &apos;t like the fact
that a minister &apos;s son is openly gay .
and they tell me about it .
i &apos;ll take it down , okay ? i didn &apos;t mean to ...
and if you &apos;re gonna go around and tell everyone
we &apos;re like boyfriends or whatever ...
you should at least ask me out first .
i ... should ?
okay , um ...
would you like to go out sometime ?
that &apos;s better .
i have some tax issues with the irs .
i owe some money .
wait , dad .
why am i just finding this out now ?
i didn &apos;t wanna worry you , honey .
you &apos;re not just talking about your money , it &apos;s our money .
yes , i know perfectly well , dana ,
but they were my mistakes .
i wanted to find a solution ,
so we both didn &apos;t have to stress out .
how much do we owe ?
nothing i can &apos;t handle .
that &apos;s why i wanted an appraisal of the house .
i know you and stef must have some equity in it by now .
i can take out a line of credit and pay it off ,
no problem .
except stef and i already took out a line of credit on the house .
what ? what for ?
the adoption fees for callie and jude .
house repairs , the remodel .
day @-@ to @-@ day stuff with five kids , dad .
oh , my god , stewart .
no , please , baby , don &apos;t worry !
stop telling me not to worry .
we have a lot of options .
i got us into this mess , i can get us out .
all right ?
last thing i wanted to do was ruin you party .
okay , if everybody could gather around , please .
everybody . got a little surprise
for the birthday girl , wherever she is .
hi , my love .
wow , 40 . you &apos;re in your 40s .
you can tell me what that &apos;s like maybe a little bit later .
so , in honor of this totally arbitrary milestone ,
your friends and family have put together a bit of a tribute
to show you just how much you mean to them .
happy birthday , mama . we love you .
are you seriously 40 ?
that is crazy old .
hey , don &apos;t be rude !
what ?
happy birthday !
we love you .
hey , you okay ?
did you tell your grandmother you paid for my lawyer ?
no . why ?
you and stef
gave us the greatest gift when you adopted us ,
so what can we give you that even comes close ?
