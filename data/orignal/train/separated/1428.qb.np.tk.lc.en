so the rate of diffusion equals something
times the square root of ... something ...
i give up .
aw , so close .
shut up .
hey , don &apos;t worry . you &apos;ll get it .
you know , a lot of famous scientists are women .
they &apos;re fat , though , right ?
come on , alex . it &apos;s time for your cello lesson .
how &apos;s the tutoring going ?
are you familiar with the term
&quot; throwing good money after bad &quot; ?
are you familiar with the term
&quot; dunphy , party of one &quot; ?
because you will be .
girls .
haley &apos;s coming along really well , mrs. dunphy .
good . good .
well , the key is to take a lot of little breaks
so you don &apos;t get frustrated and want to quit .
got it .
i was talking to david .
come on , sweetie .
i &apos;m just saying -- she &apos;s never gonna get a job ,
and how do we know the right middle @-@ eastern businessman
wouldn &apos;t treat her great ?
i left my shopping list inside .
for the record , we thought she could live with you .
like i &apos;m gonna tell any of you where i live .
haley !
what ?
we only do this when i get one right .
momma should be here by now .
i wonder what &apos;s keeping her .
well , cam , that depends . did she take her jalopy
or one of them new fancy flyin &apos; machines ?
you know , missouri is more cosmopolitan
than you give it credit for , mitchell .
it &apos;s got a very vibrant cowboy @-@ poetry scene .
i &apos;m not sure you &apos;re making the point that you think --
that &apos;s her . come on . look alive . look alive .
momma !
oh , my baby !
oh , my little bomber . puppy kiss .
mitchell , get over here !
aah , hey , barb !
oh , my baby &apos;s baby ! how are you ?
well , i don &apos;t want to overstate this ,
but my mom is the greatest woman that ever lived .
cam loves his mom .
she raised 4 kids , 2 barns ,
and a whole lot of hell .
well , that sounds like a country song .
and that song would be called
&quot; the greatest woman that ever lived . &quot;
cam loves his mom .
from the minute i met barb ,
she has been open and loving and -- and caring .
oh , i have missed these shoulders !
if i had one complaint --
and i do --
it &apos;s the ... inappropriate putting of her hands on my body .
hey , barb . i got you the cranberries you wanted for the stuffing .
oh , bless your heart .
let me get in there and help ya .
and a horsey bite .
this is how i like to cuddle .
it &apos;s been -- it &apos;s been going on a long time .
jay , you want to go to the mall with me ?
no , actually , my stomach &apos;s a little funny today .
oh , i am so sorry , papi .
maybe we &apos;ll stop first at the crib store ,
and you lay down , and i buy you a little dress , huh ?
gloria thinks americans are babies .
well , in colombia , we couldn &apos;t go running to the hospital
for every little sniffle or dislocated shoulder .
okay . good .
5 @-@ 6 . i serve . huh ?
jay , what are your symptoms ?
nausea , bloating ?
manny , what did i say about getting off
that crazy doctor website ?
i &apos;m just worried about jay .
stomach pains can mean a lot of things --
intestinal blockage ...
do you have a fever ?
stop it ! manny , he &apos;s fine .
tell him you &apos;re fine .
i &apos;m fine .
okay , good . get in the car .
uh , home fine , not mall fine .
jay , you know what happens when i shop angry .
i &apos;ll clear a space .
i &apos;m not loving your color .
go play .
don &apos;t be a hero .
so , dumb guys go for dumb girls ,
and smart guys go for dumb girls ?
what do the smart girls get ?
cats mostly .
so , haley , how long have i been paying this guy
to make out with you ?
uh , about a week .
first it was just to shut him up ,
but now i &apos;m starting to like him .
if you really like him , though ,
you have to break up with dylan .
what ? no !
believe me --
and it &apos;s best for everybody if you just do it quickly .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re having this conversation .
he &apos;s like part of the family .
trust me -- it &apos;s the right thing to do .
just end it .
okay , but be gentle .
boys are surprisingly sensitive at that age .
water @-@ polo @-@ girl story .
yes , i &apos;m gonna tell the water @-@ polo @-@ girl story ,
&apos;cause it hurt !
okay , so i &apos;m working in the principal &apos;s office .
she walks in ,
hair all silver from the chlorine ...
tells me she wants her varsity jacket back .
i tear up a little ,
then i tear up a lot .
i &apos;m begging , i &apos;m begging --
at some point i realize
i &apos;m sitting on the button
to the high @-@ school intercom system .
yuk it up , ladies .
wasn &apos;t funny then , is not funny now .
it was traumatic , haley .
don &apos;t do dylan like linda &quot; the cannon &quot; concannon did me .
oh , honey ...
that was a long time ago .
i loved her .
okay . i know .
you know what ?
maybe i &apos;ll call dylan after he talks to haley .
he &apos;s gonna need someone to lean on .
but that someone should not be his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s father .
honey , when dylan is out of her life ,
he should be out of ours .
you &apos;ve always hated dylan .
i have not always hated dylan .
i have always thought that haley could do better .
plus , the new boyfriend is so smart .
it &apos;s done . we broke up .
what ? !
i texted dylan . it &apos;s over .
i &apos;ll bet that &apos;s him .
sad @-@ face emoticon !
you can feel the hurt through the phone !
cam &apos;s mom &apos;s been half of the dinner with her hands
all over me .
it was like she was blind
and wanted to know what my thighs looked like .
are you sure ?
i mean , are you really the best judge of this kind of a thing ?
you &apos;ve had boundary issues since you were a kid .
i have not !
okay . sorry . my mistake .
must be cam &apos;s mom ... her issues .
what are you doing ?
nothing -- just getting a spoon . - stop it .
is it bothering you ?
yes , it is .
hey , mitchell
claire , stop it ! stop it !
mitchell , mitchell , mitchell , mitchell -- - force field !
that never stops being fun .
good .
listen , this is -- this is not in my head , claire .
and it &apos;s actually getting worse .
what does cam say ?
well , he never seems to notice .
and i certainly can &apos;t talk to him about it
because god forbid i say anything negative about his mom .
one time i added salt to her casserole ...
... and he went into the garage and punched the car .
okay , mitchell , if this is happening --
and i &apos;m pretty sure it isn &apos;t --
thank you . supportive .
then you need cam to see his mom feeling you up
and then make cam deal with it .
think about it .
hi , dylan .
hey , mrs. dunphy .
or , i guess , now that haley and i broke up ,
i should call you &quot; claire . &quot;
actually , i think we &apos;re gonna stick with &quot; mrs. dunphy . &quot;
come on in . how are you doing ?
not so good .
i mean , everywhere i look , i see her face .
to be fair , dylan , that is a family portrait .
i got to go get some of my stuff . is that cool ?
oh , sure . yeah .
there she is again !
oh , don &apos;t look on the bookshelf !
you &apos;re just gonna ...
hey , kid , you got a minute ?
i need the name of that medical website .
can this wait until i &apos;m home ?
i &apos;m having the round of my life .
i &apos;ve been thinking , i might have a couple of those , uh ,
those symptoms you were talking about .
i see .
you might as well play through .
it &apos;s gonna be a while .
i mean , i &apos;m probably wrong ,
but , you know , i just , uh , want to make sure .
is that manny ?
work .
so , uh , tell them i &apos;ll --
i &apos;ll get that order out this afternoon , huh ?
did she buy that ?
because it sounded fake on this end .
i &apos;ll talk to you later , tom .
tom .
dylan !
oh , dylan , dylan , dylan , dylan .
hey , mr. dunphy .
hey , now that you guys are broken up ,
you can call me whatever you want .
phil , vitamin p. , p. daddy .
okay , phil .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna miss that bad boy .
when i forget my own axe ,
sometimes i come in here and noodle on it .
actually , i &apos;ve been writing a little song of my own .
might be able to pluck out a few ...
you know , i keep on hoping that this is just a dream ,
that haley and i didn &apos;t really break up .
but it &apos;s not a dream ...
unless the whole thing was a dream
and we never even dated in the first place .
weird -- this is kind of what my song &apos;s about .
yeah . weird .
i know this is tough , but you &apos;re gonna be fine .
you know , i was a lot like you in high school ...
except my hair was shorter
and my guitar was a flute .
well , if you want your own guitar ,
i mean , we could --
we could go out and we &apos;d pick you one .
oh , i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s such a good idea .
yeah . totally .
well
i guess i &apos;ll get going .
so ...
i can ... well , be alone forever .
uh , what -- what the hell ?
let &apos;s go guitar shopping .
awesome .
uh , do me a favor . don &apos;t -- don &apos;t tell mrs. dunphy ?
yeah . definitely . you got it .
okay . all right .
well , i guess i &apos;ll see ya .
okay . you --
you , uh , you can go ahead and exit
through the ... front door .
oh , right . habit .
my old yearbook !
you know i saved them all .
oh , look .
what ?
&quot; you &apos;re the cutest boy in school .
you &apos;re gonna have an awesome summer .
smooches -- brenda . &quot;
oh , brenda , you are about to have
the most confusing summer of your life .
hey , guys !
oh , there &apos;s mitchell !
my little corn silk !
oh , barb , oh , you are such a good hugger .
isn &apos;t she the best hugger ?
oh , thank you .
oh , and look what i -- i got you , barb .
what &apos;s that ?
scratchers !
mmm ...
thank you .
nice .
oh , that &apos;s your tea . i &apos;m gonna get your tea .
thanks , honey .
well , i need a quarter .
oh . let me have that .
oh , wow , yeah , feel free to fish around in there .
cam ? cam .
i &apos;d like a cup , too , please .
just a second .
ohh , barb , ohh . you know what ?
i @-@ i @-@ i strained myself so bad today .
well , what &apos;s hurtin &apos; on ya ?
it &apos;s this area between my , uh , lower back
and upper thigh .
sounds like your fanny .
it &apos;s my fanny .
it &apos;s really knotted up .
well , you need someone to work on that .
ohh , i would love that . just -- it &apos;s really seized up .
just put your fingers all over my ...
my fanny .
your magic fingers ... barb .
momma ? your tea .
mitchell ?
thanks , sweetie .
see you in the room for a minute ?
thank you . it &apos;s very hot .
don &apos;t burn your tongue .
all right , honey .
okay , i am not gonna cry ,
but i want to know why , mitchell ,
why you are presenting to my mother like a baboon .
i wanted you to see her fondling me .
so , you do want me to cry .
no , no , cam , it &apos;s just that ...
she &apos;s always touching me inappropriately ,
and you never seem to notice .
show me , mitchell .
show me on lily &apos;s doll where my mother is touching you .
i know that you don &apos;t want to hear this , but she &apos;s handsy ,
and it makes me uncomfortable .
oh , my god . i know what this is .
you &apos;re just not used to having a mother that shows affection .
oh , do not make this about my mother .
i didn &apos;t .
but it is normal for a mother to be physical .
and it is not strange
for an occasional hug or a little pat on tanny .
okay , these aren &apos;t pats , cam -- no .
she squeezes and lingers !
show me where she squeezes and lingers .
cam , put the doll down .
i don &apos;t know if this is just sexual or -- or crazy town ,
but your mother cannot keep her hands off of me ,
and it &apos;s creeping me out
no .
barb ...
let me show you
where you stabbed my momma .
thanks for helping me pick out my axe .
you were so right , by the way .
the one with two necks would have been overkill .
if you want , you can have some of that .
diet starts tomorrow !
don &apos;t tell mrs. dunphy about this , either .
i , uh , i always wanted to go to this place with haley ,
but she said it looked stupid .
she &apos;s a girl with strong opinions --
like her mother .
claire hates this new sweatshirt i bought .
she says it looks like something
a girl would wear to the beach .
yeah , it does .
but i wear it anyway .
see ?
i figure , why be alive if you can &apos;t do the things
you &apos;re passionate about ?
what are you passionate about , dylan ?
uh , i always wanted to drive to graceland .
fun ! what else ?
i know a guy who can get me a pet bobcat .
yeah ! no , you don &apos;t really know what they &apos;re gonna do .
the point is , you got your whole life ahead of you .
enjoy being single .
i really got to play that song for you .
this is all in there .
yeah .
awesome . be right back .
hey , hey , come here .
is that guy over there with someone ?
could you tell if there was anything going on between them ?
i don &apos;know .
they were talking about taking a trip to graceland together .
he just wants to go
&apos;cause he thinks it &apos;s an amusement park !
i got to tell you ,
this is looking more and more like diverticulitis .
do they say how to treat it ?
like a heating pad or -- ohh -- there it is again .
well , describe the pain .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m being stabbed ,
but also like i ate a bad scallop
that &apos;s stabbing me from the inside .
that &apos;s colorful , but there &apos;s no box for that .
what are you guys looking at ?
girls !
huffington post ... girls .
manny , let me see that screen .
what did i tell you ?
it &apos;s not his fault . i asked him to look .
i &apos;m starting to think i have a serious problem here .
yes , you do ! that computer !
you read it there , you think it here ,
you feel it here .
you want to feel better ?
there -- you &apos;re cured .
give me 15 minutes ,
then tell florence nightingale i went to the hospital .
i &apos;m gonna kill her ! i &apos;m gonna kill him !
i &apos;m gonna kill both of them !
what happened ?
dylan has a new girlfriend !
when did that happen ?
who cares ?
i &apos;m just surprised he didn &apos;t say anything ...
to you .
he &apos;s not answering my texts .
how could he do this to me ? !
oh , honey , you were the one who broke up with him .
i didn &apos;t think he was gonna find someone so fast !
maybe he &apos;s better than i thought .
no , he &apos;s not . what ? no , he &apos;s not better !
no , you know who &apos;s better ?
david -- david the tutor .
smart , smart david ?
maybe that &apos;s him right now !
do you want the house to yourself ?
for just a little while .
i got your texts .
you swore a lot .
who is she ?
who is who ?
your new girlfriend .
i need her name and address , so i can mess her up .
i don &apos;t have a new girlfriend .
don &apos;t play dumb , dylan .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m never playing dumb !
i saw you at that stupid restaurant ,
sharing a sundae with her ugly sweatshirt on the chair .
oh , is that the skank ?
no ... no , there &apos;s -- there &apos;s no skank .
well , then why aren &apos;t yo answering it ?
&apos;cause i want to talk to you .
well , i want to talk to her .
i &apos;m gonna call her back
and tell her to keep her hands off
of what belongs to me .
haley ...
hello .
dad ?
haley ?
oh ... my ... god -- the sweatshirt ?
that was you with dylan ? !
wait , you &apos;re the other girl ?
no , we &apos;re just friends !
phil , what are you --
okay , put the phone down .
what is going on ?
he needed someone to talk to .
he took the break @-@ up pretty hard .
but -- - you did ?
i mean , i kept on hoping that we &apos;d get back together .
thinking of you with someone else just drove me crazy .
me too , baby .
but then your da helped me figure out
maybe it &apos;s best if we &apos;re apart .
nice .
i mean , i think i just need
a little time to date ... dylan .
and i mean me , not another guy named dylan .
so , we &apos;re still broken up ?
yeah , i think so .
wow . okay ... um ... i don &apos;t know -- i &apos;ll see you .
bye .
are you okay , baby ?
do you need another pillow ?
i know you think this is nothing ,
but he did say it could be an ulcer .
he also said it could be gas .
do you want me to burp you ? come here . come here .
dollars to doughnuts , it &apos;s diverticulitis .
actually , it &apos;s not .
you have acute pendicitis .
we need to get you into surgery right away .
emergency surgery . i told you it was something .
that can &apos;t be right . you have to check again !
the tests are conclusive .
everything will be all right , mr. pritchett .
let &apos;s go .
no , jay , if that &apos;s true ,
yhen i &apos;m the worst wife in the whole wide world !
i made you suffer for two whole days !
honey , it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not okay !
why ? ! why do i always almost kill my husbands ? !
and i want to hear this story sometime ,
but i &apos;m sort of counting down to a rupture here !
no ! ! you can &apos;t go without forgiving me !
what if you die in there ?
what do i do without you ? !
i forgive you ,
but nobody dies of an appendectomy !
true , it &apos;s usually the anesthesia that gets you .
you &apos;re over 60 , right ?
i will never forget you , jay ! !
could you go back to not caring , please ? !
mitchell , it &apos;s barb .
ohh , barb . i &apos;m so sorry .
well , no , no , honey , you hush .
look , i ...
i &apos;ve been thinking about what i heard , and ...
maybe i do touch you too much .
and i could say it &apos;s &apos; cause we &apos;re a family ,
but , you know , i don &apos;t know .
i guess i have been having some fun with you ,
and i ... i thought that it was harmless ,
but i would never want to make you uncomfortable .
barb , it &apos;s my fault , too .
so we &apos;re okay ?
yes , yes , of course .
thank god .
&apos;cause i couldn &apos;t live with myself
if things stayed weird between us .
uh , cam ? cam ?
what is it ?
well , we got it all worked out , sweetie !
oh , great . let me get my camera !
okay , that &apos;s not necessary -- no !
from now on , if i go too far ,
please , you just tell me about it .
okay .
what is that ? oh -- ohh !
almost lost my bracelet .
that would be an area that &apos;s okay .
no !
oh , dang it !
i &apos;ll get it . i &apos;ll get it .
oh , no , i saw where it fell .
force field ! force field !
what &apos;s going on ?
i lost my bracelet in here .
momma !
listen , i think this might be one of those situations
where mitchell feels like you &apos;re crossing a boundary .
really ?
like , this too ?
well ... i ... i got to have a good long think
about how i conduct myself .
i &apos;m truly sorry , mitchell .
it &apos;s okay ! it &apos;s okay .
well , let &apos;s take one quick picture ,
and we &apos;ll get out of his way .
yeah . absolutely .
scooch together there .
this all right ?
okay .
i miss him .
he was your first real boyfriend .
i keep expecting him to show up .
he used to come by at night ,
and i &apos;d sneak out to see him .
yeah , i know .
you knew ?
his car is 30 years old and doesn &apos;t have a muffler .
and he honked .
i loved that car .
i rode in it to the guitar store .
i felt like i was flying .
i know it hurts now , sweetheart , but ...
that &apos;s how you know it was a relationship worth having .
thanks , dad .
so dylan , you love the graceland ?
yeah , that &apos;s true .
probably would be cooler if they had roller coasters .
still , it &apos;s fun to see where the king lived , huh ?
no . no , no , no .
that &apos;s just an expression . america doesn &apos;t have a king .
yeah . oh , sure . uh @-@ huh . when ?
well , that &apos;s not always the case .
so , dylan , did you get a chance
to listen to that song i sent you ?
