while she was away .

just so he could look cool .

you can &apos;t invite him , schmidt .
on the other hand , you know ,
a bachelor party does cost a lot of money .
i &apos;m your best man .

first of all , you &apos;re saying
&quot; bachelors party , &quot; which is wrong .

for the party , yeah .
we don &apos;t have to go anywhere .
you want to go somewhere , right ?

than what ploons could do .
well , he &apos;d go to vegas , which ... which sounds awesome .
we &apos;re going to tokyo !
i mean , look at you . you &apos;re obsessed
with japanese culture , you wear the kimono , right ?

i appreciate the effort , i do ,
but we don &apos;t need to go to ...

and i &apos;ll make note of it .
you &apos;re not even typing .
2 : i already bought the tickets ,

trust me , it &apos;ll work .
i &apos;ve done the math ,
and if we rent out every room for a month ,
we &apos;ll have enough money , we won &apos;t need todd .
the hospitality industry is fast @-@ paced

and you have the focus
of a coked @-@ up italian on a summer day .
i &apos;m very focused .
you &apos;re not even looking at me right now .

no , schmidt , we don &apos;t need his money .
look at me .
okay ... schmidty , i &apos;m your best man .
and i may not be a rich man .

to push the buttons on the microwave from the table ,
so you don &apos;t have to get up .
you mean like a stick ?
my point is ,
it &apos;s my job to give you
the bachelors party of your dreams .

it &apos;s just a glass , right ?

oh , i mean , i &apos;m stuck on a love scene .

what ?
as his electric car powered down ,
the first thing he saw was ...
no , look at me .
look at me .
do i have to ?
yeah .
... first thing he saw was her virgin breasts glowing
in the alabama moonlight .
she said ,
which one do you want to see ?
the left or the right ?
and i said , &apos; both.&apos;
she said , &apos; no , pick one.&apos;
so i said , &apos; left.&apos;
she finally showed him ,
and it was as big as a cadillac .
she grabbed him by the potatoes and led him up the stairs .
so many stairs .
left , right , left ,
right , left ,
right .
he grabbed the banister and then let go .
oh , that &apos;s erotic stuff .
oh , thank you .
you &apos;re very welcome .
that &apos;s very sexy stuff you &apos;re writing .
thanks .
the sexiest , really .
where the hell have you been ?
the parakeet was still in the room ,
but it turned out to be a welcome addition
to the games at hand .
lose that one ?
i don &apos;t even get that one .
i didn &apos;t get that one .
let go of it . i have no emotional connection .
you &apos;re cracking ; take your 15 .
i &apos;m not cracking .
nuts .
you weak @-@ handed moron !
hey !
who also is our cherished guest here .
it &apos;s just the weight of it .
the liquid and the balance of it ... i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;ll help clean it up .
no , please , let me clean it up .
you keep writing .
i think you &apos;re cracking .
you need to take your 15 .
i don &apos;t need a 15 ; i &apos;m gonna take a 15 more of work .
you need a 15 ; take a 15 .
pull it together .
i will not take a 15 ever again in my whole life .
i &apos;m so sorry about this . take a 15 .
&quot; she took a 15 on my face . &quot;
focus .
focus !
sorry about the little misunderstanding there , all right ?
is this oolong tea ?
yeah .
yeah , well , jess never gives me caffeine .
why wouldn &apos;t you tell me that ?
you know , this breakup has got me going crazy , cece .
so you just need to calm down , okay ?
i &apos;m gonna need you to nurture me .
i &apos;m gonna need you to nurture me .
okay , all right , i can do that part . here we go .
so , um , maybe this breakup
isn &apos;t such a bad thing .
now you can stop wasting your life
and find someone more realistic .
yeah , someone who &apos;s , like , in your league .
what ?
because you don &apos;t want to die alone ,
so you kind of have to settle
and lower your standards
and find someone that &apos;s just , like , in your lane .
what ... ?
if you stay in your lane ,
you &apos;ll be happy , &apos; cause you won &apos;t be alone .
right ?
what are you saying ?
someone a little older , dumpier .
you are so bad at this .
for crying out loud .
who do we give our laundry to ?
the ad said it was included .
i suppose , i suppose me , uh , i guess .
here you go .
oh , dear lord .
where do the entertainment types tend to hang out ?
crystal is a performer .
we &apos;d love to get her in front of the right set of eyes .
this is all underpants .
showtime !
mm ... no , oh , no , no .
crystal !
oh , no .
no , no , no , no , honey , no acting .
i feel that you &apos;re gonna start a monologue of some sort ,
and i really don &apos;t want to hear it . i have no tolerance .
please , i &apos;m begging you .
is that your moment before ? please don &apos;t do that .
you don &apos;t know what out of order is ,
what the hell ?
mr. trask !

i &apos;d take a flame thrower to this place !
pacino , scent of a woman .
i got the referen--
wait a minute .

i know it was you , fredo .
you broke my heart .
do you only do pacino ?
you knock him down .

don &apos;t do heat . i &apos;m ... oh , god .
&apos;cause she &apos;s got a great ass !
nickolo .

you got a weird vibe right now , bud .
i called todd .
w @-@ w ... you just say , &quot; hi , what &apos;s up ?
no .
don &apos;t come to the bachelor party . &quot;
no , i made plans with him .
i &apos;m gonna invite him and ask him to pay .
what ? ! you ...
i &apos;m sorry !
i hear the blues a @-@ callin&apos;
tossed salad and scrambled eggs .
is she listening to frasier reruns ?
i &apos;m in the middle of a fight with you .
there &apos;s this one episode , right ?
where niles ,
he &apos;s making an origami flower ,
and frasier comes in and asks ...
well , i &apos;m sorry , actually , it &apos;s daphne that comes in and asks ...
why &apos;d you invite todd ? !
is that what daphne asks ?
&apos;cause if i &apos;m daphne , that &apos;s what i &apos;m asking .
he sucks . i could &apos;ve done it !
then what does , uh , frasier say ?
you would never be frasier in this scenario .
who would i be ?
obviously the dad ,
the lazy piece of dump
that sits on the chair .
and you just broke my heart .
nick , i would just like to say
that you had a vision for this hotel .
i &apos;d also like to say that i may die alone .
it could happen .
yeah .
be nice if you surprised us .
i &apos;ll try .
okay , look , nick , i &apos;m sorry that i called todd .
you can suck todd &apos;s gas till you &apos;re blue in the face ,
but i won &apos;t .
not now , not ever .
i &apos;ll pay my own way to tokyo ,
&apos;cause the hotel &apos;s still open , so ...
kumiko seems happy .
you could get some money back from her .
yeah . i ca--
i &apos;m not gonna charge her ; i can &apos;t charge her .
what ?
why wouldn &apos;t you charge her ?
why can &apos;t you charge kumiko ?
to be honest , because we had a sexual encounter .
there we go .
shame , shame .
i knew it , nick !
you weren &apos;t in the bathroom fixing the shower .
you were showing her the business center .
okay , in my defense , it wasn &apos;t in the shower .
it was in the hallway for a few moments .
don &apos;t refer to it as a hallway . yuck .
i literally meant the hallway .
and it was vibrant , if that &apos;s a word you could use
in this situation , &apos; cause that &apos;s what it was ; it was like--
just admit it , nick , you screwed up .
i did not screw up !
well , you certainly can &apos;t charge her now .
yes , i can .
sure i can .
hey , kumiko .
can i have a minute of your time ?
i had a ...
i enjoyed our special time today .
i haven &apos;t taken my pants off in front of a woman
in quite some time .
i &apos;m sorry that the pretzel fell out .
that was unexpected .
i honestly don &apos;t know how long it was in my underpants ,
and that was disturbing to me .
thank you for not overreacting to it .
i &apos;m here to talk about money .
american currency .
our special time
was not included , financially , in the room rate .
&apos;cause i &apos;m running a business .
and i can &apos;t be soft here .
i understand .
i give you money .
thank you for being so cool ! that &apos;s what-- yes .
you are prostitute .
working boy .

i want sex .
you want sex .
but need money .

hotel owner .
sorry , winston , i mean , this is all my fault .
no , no , no , no , no . no , cece , you &apos;re fine .
you were right . you really were .
i mean , kc and i were , we weren &apos;t going anywhere .
let &apos;s be honest .
i just want to find somebody , cece ; i really do .
so bad it hurts .
from my head to my turd pipe .
that &apos;s ... sweet .
i got so much love to give , cece .
i really do , so why am i always on the phone ,
getting dumped , crying my eyes out like an idiot ?
well , there must be something that you can do .
well , you know , if jess were here , she would tell me to :
&quot; just believe in yourself , winston ,
and , like , be positive . &quot;
well , forget what jess would say
and forget what i would say .
what do you think would really break the cycle ?
i just want , for once in my life ,
for someone to cry over me .
right , okay , explore that .
somebody to just cry because of ...
that &apos;s a great idea , cece !
it is ?
yes !
this is what i &apos;m gonna do .
we &apos;re gonna make kc cry over me .
oh , no , no , that &apos;s not ,
that &apos;s not where i thought you were going--
we &apos;re gonna make a girl cry today !
couldn &apos;t take the money ?
thought you were a prostitute ?
it &apos;s time for todd .
yeah , okay . all right .
you ever taken gloves off before ?
we could &apos;ve paid for tokyo ,
but a business venture went south and ultimately ,
it was my fault because the company was my baby .
i can &apos;t believe you guys have never been to tokyo .
i &apos;ve been there 28 times !
where do you guys get your sneakers ?
28 times ?
yes .
and you idiots couldn &apos;t even
figure out how to get there once ?
you know what you deserve for that , nick ?
what ?
you deserve a one @-@ nut slap , my friend .
you &apos;re not slapping one of my nuts , todd .
oh , yes , i am .
i &apos;m an adult man .

i do , however , still owe $ 9,000 .
wow . you guys are good friends .
yep .
yeah .
i don &apos;t have any friends .
no one likes me .
ooh , why would you say that , todd ?
i have a terrible personality .

no i &apos;m not ! i &apos;m ...
yeah , all right , you guys caught me .
i see it in your mouth .

it is the worst idea that i have ever heard .
uh , remember when you said ,
&quot; i &apos;m cece . i &apos;m super supportive &quot; ?
now &apos;s your time to shine .
yes , it isn &apos;t like a blank check , though .
this idea does not deserve to be supported ,
because it &apos;s insane .
yeah , that &apos;s what i need , cece !
i need insane !
look , cece ,
it &apos;s no big deal , but i need this more
than i &apos;ve needed anything in my entire life .
i don &apos;t want to ...
