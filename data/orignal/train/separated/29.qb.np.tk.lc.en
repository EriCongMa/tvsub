do we tell mom ?
they sent them to mom to hurt her .
so i say no .
you , mr.florrick , have been granted a retrial .
he &apos;s taking pictures of our front door .
so , who is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe we should just get on with our ...
here we go .
i love you both .
hi .
hi .
hi , dad .
zack .
hi , grace .
we made you a cake .
would that be an upside @-@ down pineapple cake ?
it must remain connected at all times to your phone .
any tampering results in immediate termination of the program .
the transmitter is to be worn around your ankle at all times .
it &apos;s waterproof and shockproof .
it sends a signal to the hmd every five minutes .
it must not cross this line .
if you accidentally cross the line ...
... you &apos;ll hear an alarm
then you &apos;ll receive a telephone call from our monitoring center .
you need to answer that call within five rings
or you &apos;re terminated from the program .
do you understand ?
i understand .
it &apos;s okay .
you are confined to the apartment 24 hours a day .
there is no use of cell phones
or internet @-@ based communications , passive or active .
no e @-@ mail , no web surfing .
how will you know ?
zach .
no internet communications .
will that be a problem ?
no .
now i need to attach the transmitter to your ankle .
do you want to ... ?
right over here .
excuse me .
let me know if this is too tight .
it &apos;s just like cinderella .
you &apos;re really all right with all of this ?
yeah , yeah , it &apos;s cool .
i was doing some research on who else was under house arrest .
um ... aung suu kyi , roman polanski .
okay , zach .
hey , dad , there &apos;s something that i want to show you on my computer .
grace , will you help me with the dishes ?
maybe tomorrow after school .
sure . i &apos;m not going anywhere .
i like it-- the apartment .
it &apos;s fifth the size .
do you miss the house ?
no .
sometimes .
i have to work in the morning , so ...
it &apos;s weird , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;re going to work , i &apos;m staying at home .
yeah .
it &apos;s good to have you home .
what was the first thing i saw ?
well , i guess it was the body .
and this was the victim , miles wagner ?
yes , sir .
i &apos;m glad he &apos;s dead !
i should have done it myself !
he deserved it !
i hope you rot in hell , wagner .
sheriffs .
members of the jury , you are again instructed
to disregard these outbursts .
i &apos;m sorry . mr. landry .
as you were saying , detective .
mr. wagner owns linked asset management
on the 75th floor ,
and it appeared he was gunned down as he was walking to his car .
what else did you find at the scene , detective ?
well ... him .
brad broussard .
covered in blood .
and how did he kill wagner ?
objection .
withdrawn .
how was wagner killed ?
two 9mm bullets in the torso ,
one point @-@ blank in his neck .
way to go , brad !
you &apos;ll show brad ?
yes , but i think you should .
he wanted a girl .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s not a girl .
men don &apos;t know what they want .
uh , d @-@ do you think he &apos;ll ever get out on bail ?
we &apos;re trying .
and visitation ?
it &apos;s hard .
because we &apos;re not married ?
you @-@ you &apos;ll give it to him ?
now , the accused was mr. wagner &apos;s bodyguard ?
yes , sir .
and did he carry a gun ?
yes , a 9mm .
the same as the murder weapon .
now , did mr. broussard seem agitated
when you questioned him ?
he did .
he had been encouraged to invest his life savings with mr. wagner ,
and , well , that was lost , too .
yeah , he lost mine , too !
order !
lost with the rest of his investments ?
could you explain ?
mr. wagner and a partner ran a mutual fund ,
which was one of the largest feeders to bernie madoff &apos;s ponzi scheme .
and that was , in your opinion , mr. broussard &apos;s motive ?
yes .
thank you , detective .
brad .
hey . where &apos;s judith ?
she &apos;ll be in in a minute .
she wanted you to have that .
it &apos;s a boy .
order . order .
he &apos;s so beautiful .
detective , let &apos;s return to this motive , shall we ?
mr. wagner lost my client &apos;s life savings of $ 98,000 ?
is that correct ?
i &apos;m not aware of the amount .
well , i am .
it was $ 98,000 .
and yet , do you know how much mr. wagner lost
or his other clients ?
no , ma &apos;am .
$ 800 million .
your honor , does ms. lockhart actually need a witness ?
in the form of an objection , mr. landry .
argumentative .
overruled .
half the people in this court are here
because mr. wagner lost their savings .
objection .
withdrawn .
but , detective ,
if having your savings devastated by mr. wagner constitutes motive ,
aren &apos;t there thousands of suspects ?
ma &apos;am , thousands of suspects weren &apos;t seen entering
the parking garage at the time of the murder .
thousands of suspects didn &apos;t own the murder weapon .
now , this 9mm gun owned by brad ...
did you ever find it ?
no .
and the $ 50,000 in cash that miles wagner was carrying that night ...
did you find that on the scene ?
no .
any theories on how my client got rid of the gun and the money ?
no , ma &apos;am .
and when you arrived at the scene and you found my client ,
as you say , &quot; covered with blood , &quot;
what did you find him doing ?
i don &apos;t understand .
did you find him choking mr. wagner ,
firing bullets into his body ?
no .
then what did you find him doing ?
applying cpr .
and do you consider that a fairly common mo for a killer ?
argumentative .
that &apos;s fine , your honor . i don &apos;t have anything more .
so where are we on other suspects ?
well , in most cases we &apos;d be struggling .
in this , we &apos;re drowning .
everybody wanted wagner dead .
that is the fifth fruit basket we &apos;ve gotten
this week for representing the man who killed him .
yes , i just wish all these supporters
actually thought he was innocent .
well , for reasonable doubt , we just need to give the jury another suspect ,
so let &apos;s find somebody .
hey , you lost your ballistics expert , didn &apos;t you ?
oh , yeah , turns out wagner looted his mutual fund , too .
why ?
i have someone you should meet .
oh , alicia , by the way ,
i @-@ i &apos;m moving you onto the haskin tax case .
cary , you &apos;ll take witness prep .
why , did i do something wrong ?
no , no , no , you were great . we &apos;re just moving around junior associates .
just send your notes down to cary to take over .
okay , we still need to pursue the money angle .
wagner &apos;s aide said he left with $ 50,000
he had hidden in his office , so where is it ?
cary , if you could start moving on that , i &apos;d appreciate it .
you &apos;re watching reality tv .
reality 24 @-@ 7 .
next on reality tv : his pain is your pain ,
his troubles are your troubles .
they call him the gorilla boy , and he &apos;ll steal your heart .
hey , it &apos;s me .
let &apos;s get to work .
it sends the wrong message .
what is the right message ?
you need an ambassador .
eli gold is a thug .
you need someone who &apos;s effective .
eli gold is effective .
gets things done .
gold , golden . who are we going to hire next--
goldilocks ?
childs will come after you .
hire eli gold as your campaign manager ,
he &apos;ll know you &apos;re planning to run against him .
wait .
hey , dad ,
do you have a minute ?
you need some help with your homework ?
no .
i scanned these into my computer
before grandma threw the originals away .
they were on our doorstep in an envelope .
someone knocked on our door , then left .
what ?
it &apos;s faked .
i can tell because of the light in your eyes .
please don &apos;t tell mom .
i haven &apos;t shown it to her .
daniel .
i want a meeting with eli gold .
peter , i think that &apos;s a mistake .
he &apos;s a wartime consigliere .
now .
today .
they lived together for the last three years .
she &apos;s pregnant with broussard &apos;s baby
and therefore should be granted
the same visitation rights as a married couple .
that &apos;s our argument anyway .
so what did you do wrong ?
what did i ... ?
why are you being taken off the case ?
they want me on the haskin tax thing .
okay .
so , are you going to talk to her ?
who ?
diane .
what about ?
why she &apos;s favoring cary over you .
i don &apos;t know that she is .
how long before this little competition between cary and you is over ?
a month .
and eight days .
if diane is showing favoritism ,
then you need to deal with that .
and if she &apos;s not ,
then you need to deal with that .
diane is a partner .
i &apos;m a junior associate .
yeah , whatever .
what ?
alicia , you &apos;re a good lawyer ,
but you &apos;re always waiting for people to give you things .
i am not .
okay .
then , everything will work out perfectly .
talk to diane .
tell her she &apos;s wrong to take you off the case
and that cary is going to screw it up .
or ... wait for something good to happen to you .
does she have a moment ?
she &apos;s in with the ballistics expert .
yeah .
well , it &apos;s not an all @-@ out war ,
but , i mean , will has his troops ,
i have mine .
he tried to fire my tax litigator , so i had to ,
counterattack .
uh , listen . i &apos;m , uh , in the office with someone .
lunch ? good .
sorry about that , mr ....
mcveigh .
oh , my goodness .
what an unfortunate name .
hopefully no relation ?
hopefully .
um , well , i see you were the , uh ,
ballistics expert in the crown narrows appeal ,
but you left halfway through .
why ?
found out he was guilty .
is that a deal breaker ?
it is . that &apos;s why my rates are so reasonable .
so , if you find , or you believe you find
that a client is guilty , you-- what ? -- quit ?
yes .
and if you &apos;re on the stand ?
i will excuse myself .
really ? my goodness .
you &apos;re like something out of melville .
so , why , uh , should i , uh , hire you ,
besides your reasonable rates ?
well , because the prosecution &apos;s case rests almost exclusively
on tying your client to the murder weapon ,
and i can prove that it &apos;s not his .
really ?
yes .
well , your predecessor--
the expert that you would replace--
intended to show that the 9mm was common
and the shell markings negligible .
is that not your defense ?
no , that &apos;s not my defense .
well , uh , what is ?
i don &apos;t like chicago .
let me guess .
you like the country .
yes .
some cabin somewhere where you write angry letters to the editor ?
oh , um , i &apos;ve offended you ?
no . no .
we &apos;re done .
i &apos;ll talk to you soon .
do you have a moment , diane ?
uh , i ... i have no idea .
i think i &apos;ve just been visited by the marlboro man .
who ?
oh , our ballistics expert ,
although i @-@ i don &apos;t know if he actually is ours .
i think i hired him .
i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
i just ...
i &apos;m better than cary .
on the broussard homicide .
on the eyewitness cross .
i &apos;ve been working on this case for three months intensely ,
and cary is just coming on .
i agree .
you ...
well , then , why ?
why ... why was i pulled off it ?
i don &apos;t know .
it wasn &apos;t my idea .
whose ?
will &apos;s .
thank you .
do you have a moment , will ?
actually , i don &apos;t . i got a lunch .
how about later this afternoon ?
well , you two do have a complicated relationship .
you know , an unrequited thing .
what does that even mean ?
an unrequited thing ?
look , i don &apos;t really deal well with all this high school stuff .
and wouldn &apos;t that make him want me on the case ,
not off it ?
i don &apos;t know .
alicia , complicated relationships
are a breeding ground for misinterpreted action .
going now .
bye .
no problem .
i &apos;d like to be helpful in any way i can .
i won &apos;t end up on your naughty list ?
so , this was at 9 : 35 ?
yes , uh , when my shift was over .
i ... i work as a santa claus across the street .
and i saw a man in a black suit enter the parking garage at 9 : 35 .
is the man in court today ?
yes .
that young man there .
uh , i &apos;m sorry to say .
now , mr. broussard said he
didn &apos;t enter the parking garage until after the shooting ,
but this would have him entering the garage before .
that &apos;s what i saw .
thank you , chris .
that is your real name , isn &apos;t it ?
oh , you .
take out santa .
oh , i &apos;d love to .
so , mr. suggs , chris ...
my goodness , that &apos;s a real beard , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it is .
you want to tug it ?
actually , i would . yeah .
okay , so , as you testified ,
you work as a santa during the holiday season .
what do you do for work in the off @-@ season ?
i get by .
up at the north pole ?
no , really . what do you do ?
well , there &apos;s commercial work .
and i &apos;ve worked as a movie extra .
yeah , a porno movie .
ho @-@ ho @-@ ho , wasn &apos;t it ?
objection ! relevance .
sustained .
so , chris , how do you stay warm out there
on those cold nights during the holiday season ?
i stay warm .
yeah ... but how ?
it was 22 degrees the night of the murder ,
with a windchill factor of five .
the santa suit is warm .
because we got a statement from the supervisor on your last job . your honor ?
and he said he got complaints about you drinking .
he &apos;s a liar .
really ? he &apos;s on your naughty list .
so ...
you were 55 feet from the garage--
we measured it--
and you were drinking ...
i had one drink .
and you were drinking ,
and you still swear that you saw that man ?
i already said what i said .
yes , you did .
well , thank you , santa .
and just one last thing : ho , ho , ho .
objection . your honor !
withdrawn .
so , this is the kitchen cabinet .
yep .
and this ...
this must be the faked photo . do you have the original ?
nope .
the envelope it came in ?
thrown away .
thrown away or destroyed ?
thrown away .
well , that was clumsy .
yeah .
so , eli , look .
considering your reputation ,
i think we &apos;re going to have to talk about a few ground rules .
and what have you heard about my reputation ?
that you speak your mind ,
your mind tends toward expletives ,
you are a classically trained pianist ,
and you require saturdays off .
who told you about saturdays , shiksa bambi over there ?
i &apos;ve also been told that in a street fight ,
you &apos;re the man .
you want me to watch my swearing ?
listen , considering my circumstances ,
my home will remain our base ,
and my wife and children live here .
you need to replace the strainer .
okay , first of all ...
peter ?
yes .
the only reason i &apos;m here is because what i &apos;ve heard about your reputation .
which is ?
you &apos;re a son ...
can i say &quot; son of a bitch , &quot; or is that too salty ?
that &apos;s fine .
you , sir , are a son of a bitch ,
but a son of a bitch who likes to change things for the better .
i &apos;ve also heard that you &apos;re toxic ,
and if i join your merry little band of political hobbyists here ,
i &apos;m going to end up regretting it .
that sounds about right .
okay , here &apos;s my first piece of advice .
fire bambi .
and hire your son .
this is the best piece of oppo research this campaign has done .
yes , but we &apos;re still trying to figure out who it is .
oh , i know who it is .
who ?
it &apos;s a federal investigator doing scout work for a possible indictment .
how do you know that ?
you can &apos;t know that .
oh , i know a lot of things , lady .
the question is : why don &apos;t you know it ?
look , you &apos;re under federal investigation .
what you need to find out is why .
mr. knox what was your relationship with the victim ?
go to hell !
ma &apos;am .
he stole my retirement !
he stole everything !
free brad broussard ! free brad broussard !
order .
order .
i will clear this entire courtroom if there is one more outburst .
my apologies , mr. knox .
mr. wagner and i built our investment firm up from nothing .
sadly , i was the one who suggested he hire brad as a bodyguard and driver .
now , the accused phoned you on the night of the murder , didn &apos;t he ?
objection , your honor .
this wasn &apos;t in mr. knox &apos;s statement to the police .
yes , your honor , mr. knox
has since deepened his memory of the events of that night .
oh , come on . &quot; deepened &quot; ?
i &apos;ll allow .
yes .
brad did phone me .
he was very upset .
he wanted to get married ,
and he needed his life savings to buy a house .
and what did you tell him ?
well , i tried to calm him down .
he was talking about confronting mr. wagner .
i tried to explain that we were both tricked by madoff ,
but he wouldn &apos;t listen , and he hung up .
oh . thank you , mr. knox .
ten @-@ minute recess .
i think we &apos;ve narrowed your suspects down to one .
i just wanted to know ...
just wanted to know what ?
i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll get these out to you in a second .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i checked with diane .
why i &apos;m no longer on the broussard homicide .
she said it was your decision .
yes .
i just wanted to make sure i hadn &apos;t done anything wrong .
no , no , no , no . of course not .
then i don &apos;t get it .
maybe it was a mistake .
i ... i &apos;ve been feeling guilty
lately about pulling you away
on the rucker defense and the memorial north suit .
i just thought that ...
i just thought with peter coming home ...
your life &apos;s complicated enough .
i should give you a break .
but i don &apos;t want a break .
i want to be here . i want to be doing a good job .
you are doing a good job .
then use me .
peter can take care of himself .
he &apos;s irrelevant to this .
i want to be here .
i want you to be here .
then ...
then i &apos;m here .
okay .
knox has an alibi .
he and his wife were going to a christmas party later that night ,
and were dressing at home at the time of the murder .
his alibi is his wife ?
yeah .
housekeeper was off for the night ,
and the daughter was out at a party .
well , then let &apos;s get to the wife . what else ?
well , logically ,
there is a motive .
i looked into the knox and wagner partnership .
they were facing indictment ,
and both their bank accounts were frozen .
now , although they swore
that they would fight the charges together ,
the feds were trying to turn one against the other .
i like it .
knox kills wagner to keep him from testifying .
can we get anything certain from the feds ?
i can try .
we need your help .
get your name out fast .
mrs. knox ,
i &apos;m alicia florrick .
not interested .
not fast enough .
mrs. knox , i &apos;m alicia florrick .
i just have a few questions .
maybe try another name .
trapped here , living in this limbo .
the first week it was the reporters .
then they disappeared , then it was the haters .
all the people who lost their money .
i wanted to yell , &quot; he disgusts me , too . &quot;
then why are you supporting his alibi ?
well , that &apos;s a question i &apos;ve asked myself .
were you here together all night ?
i was here .
he went out ?
i will remain discreetly silent .
that &apos;s from chicago children fighting cancer , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , a donation gift .
my husband and i attended that
fund @-@ raiser last year . it &apos;s a good cause .
terrible swedish meatballs .
i &apos;m sorry , mrs. florrick ,
but if you &apos;re looking for a hero , i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not it .
we &apos;re looking for the truth .
oh , yes , well , aren &apos;t we all ?
rachel , if we happen to get you on the stand ,
would we be happy with the results ?
let me put it this way .
yes .
but we both know
you won &apos;t be getting me on the stand ,
because my husband won &apos;t allow it .
she &apos;s right .
we &apos;ve run smack into spousal privilege .
knox can prevent her from testifying .
but spousal privilege is supposed to foster open communication
in a marriage , and there &apos;s no marriage here .
they sleep in separate rooms .
she hates him .
his scandal has turned her life into hell .
nope . tried it in another case .
courts respect marriage too much .
even bad ones .
and the state is keeping judith from visiting brad in lockup
because they &apos;re not married .
marriage is an institution fraught with ironies .
there is an exception to spousal privilege .
a third person present .
i doubt if knox is stupid enough to tell his wife
to lie in front of a third person .
their daughter .
worth a try . check that out .
rachel knox is irish .
you could try to argue
their marriage was a green card fraud on the state .
okay , we have a new mission now .
we need to break spousal privilege
so we can get rachel knox on the stand
to testify against her husband .
we do that , brad broussard has a fighting chance .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re right ,
but we have someone looking into a possible federal investigation .
just so we &apos;re clear .
if we &apos;re going to fight , you &apos;re going to lose .
peter trusts me .
golden may want you here ,
but peter is the ultimate decider .
he &apos;s the one who &apos;s ...
what are you doing ?
lowering my pants so you can kiss my ass .
i have two questions for you .
two ?
really ? they &apos;re multiplying .
the broussard homicide .
did you offer to make wagner a deal ?
no idea . not one of mine .
but you can find out , right ?
i can do a lot of things .
i &apos;m just not feeling motivated .
the second ?
peter florrick .
you know what , guys ?
i will be right upstairs in just a minute .
no .
no , you &apos;re not getting anything from me on that .
sounds serious .
no , sounds like a &quot; no comment . &quot;
it &apos;s just that ...
actually , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m not going to get anything from you , am i ?
okay , what is it ?
no , it &apos;s florrick-- he &apos;s not one of yours .
you won &apos;t be interested .
oh , no , i want to see it .
okay .
where did you get that ?
you know him ?
where did you get that ?
i &apos;ll handle this .
okay .
all right , tonight ?
9 : 00 . we &apos;ll talk .
okay .
yeah .
yeah .
hey , uh ... so i got a client here .
yeah . yeah , lunch sounds good .
okay .
is that photoshopped ?
you and the barracuda ?
no .
no , she was at a pro @-@ life rally .
oh , of course .
and you always keep her picture just right there ?
no . no , that was for you .
i got it framed , too .
i &apos;m honored .
so , what do you have to show me ?
you ... you remind me a little of her .
oh , good .
which part : quitting the governorship
or the moose hunting ?
standing up for your values .
okay .
nothing good will come out of this conversation .
so , what do you have ?
am i to follow ?
you could start a war .
they &apos;re not mine .
ongoing cases .
this is a gun identical to your clients .
beretta 92fs .
i seem to spend my life around guns these days .
and this is his ammunition .
9mm 115 grain , fmj .
fmj ?
full metal jacket .
oh , like the movie .
no barriers to the sound .
just like the garage .
there was a janitor two levels up .
he heard nothing .
visible gunpowder burns .
stippling ...
here , here around the wound ,
in a circle .
the victim .
half circle of stippling .
police say his coat collar caused the half circle .
what , you disagree ?
a line here .
meaning ?
stippling-- a half moon .
the victim was in a car .
passenger seat .
killer was driving .
he got out , came around , fired point @-@ blank .
sound was absorbed partly into the automobile .
that &apos;s why the janitor didn &apos;t hear anything .
then he fired twice more .
you might want to cover up again .
killer opened the door , pulled him out ,
tossed him on the floor , then he took off in the car .
you &apos;re not going to get reception in here .
and i already checked .
checked what ?
there was no evidence
of a shooting in mr. broussard &apos;s car .
but you are confident , mr. mcveigh ,
that the shooting happened in a car .
my confidence isn &apos;t as important as the science .
clearly , there is an imprint
of a seat belt shoulder strap on the victim .
so i sought out information on the vehicles
of the other principals in this case .
what did you discover about the car belonging to mr. knox ,
the victim &apos;s business partner ?
objection .
i &apos;m not sure why you &apos;re objecting , counselor .
i haven &apos;t heard anything yet . overruled .
i tried to investigate mr. knox &apos;s automobiles
to discover if there were signs of a shooting .
the police report says three cars were clean .
but he had four cars registered .
what happened to his fourth car ?
mr. knox claimed that it was stolen ,
day after the murder .
it was never recovered .
thank you , mr. mcveigh .
no problem .
who &apos;s it from ?
oh , no one . i mean , i don &apos;t know .
probably a secret admirer .
well , yeah . i mean , i have a lot of those .
nice work on broussard today .
thanks .
look , i know we &apos;re going through a lot of turmoil here
over the direction of the firm ,
with stern gone and all ,
but wherever we end up ...
i respect you , diane .
didn &apos;t they say that to secretariat
before they put him down ?
i don &apos;t think they said &quot; diane . &quot;
it &apos;s so cold out here .
i like the cold .
part of the program training is , they drop you in freezing water ,
and you tread water for 20 minutes .
yeah , but this is dinner .
i have something i want you to consider .
going inside ?
join us .
join you ?
and you are ?
the fbi .
you &apos;d be a good investigator .
you &apos;re being serious ?
yeah .
why ?
i like you .
you &apos;re good .
president obama got us more money
, and the hiring freeze is over .
yeah , i &apos;ve already got a job .
this one &apos;s better .
defense of your country .
who &apos;s the man in the photo ?
oh . what photo ?
the photo i showed you earlier .
what &apos;s going on with the florrick investigation ?
listen ,
i want you to work under me .
and feed me random things that you come by .
things about florrick ?
yes , that .
other things .
no .
thank you ,
but i &apos;m ... i &apos;m happy where i am .
and where is that ?
they found broussard &apos;s gun .
what ?
the murder weapon .
it was anonymously sent to the chicago pd .
and ?
bad news .
it &apos;s your client &apos;s .
broussard thinks his gun was stolen .
he says knox knew where he kept it ,
in the glove compartment .
it is pretty suspicious--
showing up anonymously right after our best day in court .
any hope on breaking spousal privilege ?
nothing on the green card .
we &apos;re still looking for the daughter ,
but she &apos;s out of the country .
okay , meet upstairs in half an hour .
it &apos;s gonna be a late night .
excuse me ?
just resting my eyes .
you &apos;re ... ?
eli gold .
my husband hired you .
you &apos;re taller than i expected .
thank you .
i thought , as we &apos;re going to be in each other &apos;s lives ,
i should introduce myself .
oh , that &apos;s really not necessary .
so , you &apos;re the force behind the force , huh ?
no . i &apos;m nobody , mr. gold .
i &apos;m just working . working here .
you don &apos;t want him to run ?
what did i say that would suggest that to you ?
just your manner .
and what does my manner suggest to you now ?
quick question .
what do you think of kya ?
no .
what ?
your political squabbles are your own , not mine .
don &apos;t try to manipulate me .
you &apos;re right . my apologies .
you know , um , you and i are going to be the best of friends , mrs. florrick .
and do you know why ?
i have no idea .
because you &apos;re cautious ,
and so am i.
your husband isn &apos;t .
nice meeting you
although i find the late arrival of this gun suspicious ,
i would be remiss if i didn &apos;t allow it into evidence .
mr. landry , please make it available to the defense .
i think we have to start talking about a deal .
but the ballistic evidence .
we &apos;ve knocked holes in their case ,
but i don &apos;t know if the holes are big enough .
how many years ?
second degree murder , ten years .
with time off for good behavior , it would be four and a half .
and if we wait for a jury ?
if convicted ?
minimum sentence of 45 years .
no parole , no time off .
he &apos;d be four years old .
you didn &apos;t do it .
see him grow up ...
it would be worth it .
i think we &apos;ve been going about this all wrong .
what ?
the $ 50,000 missing from wagner .
what happened to it ?
exactly .
knox &apos;s bank account was frozen ,
he still has that 50 grand .
unless he buried it somewhere .
i think we found our way around spousal privilege .
we can get rachel knox to testify on the stand .
how ?
rachel knox can &apos;t testify .
spousal privilege is very clear .
yes , it is , your honor , which is why she can testify .
spousal privilege is pierced
when there is a conspiracy between spouses .
what conspiracy ?
we subpoenaed the records of chicago children fighting cancer .
mrs. knox had recently been given a spire award for making a large donation ,
$ 50,000 to be exact .
an amount that cannot be explained through normal financial channels .
you &apos;re accusing mrs. knox of murdering miles wagner ?
no . rachel knox helped her husband
dispose of the money acquired from the victim .
this makes her an agent of her husband &apos;s crime ,
which breaks spousal privilege .
you want to know what happened on the night of the murder ?
yes , between the hours of 9 : 00 and 10 : 00 .
my husband left .
and when did he return ?
an hour later .
and what did he have in his possession ?
a suitcase ...
... filled with cash .
thank you .
all right , here , wait , wait , wait , wait .
you &apos;re not going to strike me out . go .
hey , babe .
how was work ? that good , huh ?
no , it &apos;s just role reversal .
how about some pizza ? we sent out .
yeah . no .
i think i just want some wine .
okay . i &apos;ll pour .
i want to talk to you about something .
what ?
just something .
don &apos;t worry .
how could they hide this from me ?
well , i think they kept it from you because they wanted to protect you .
i know .
i talked to zach .
he knows he was wrong .
it ...
yeah , but their hearts were in the right place .
i can &apos;t even absorb this .
i know .
oh , now , wait , wait .
don &apos;t talk to them now .
i told them we &apos;d talk to them tomorrow , okay ?
i don &apos;t know anymore .
i don &apos;t know ...
you had a long day .
here .
we &apos;re gonna work this out tomorrow .
i don &apos;t know if we will .
we will .
okay , are you ready ?
bring it on , dad .
go ahead , back up .
back up , zach ,
