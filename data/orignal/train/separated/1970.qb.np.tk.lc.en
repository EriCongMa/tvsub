infections have a nasty way of sneaking up on you .
you &apos;re feeling pretty good ,
you think the infection &apos;s gone ,
and then it reappears ...
out of nowhere ...
when your body &apos;s still weak ,
when you &apos;ve barely recovered ...
what &apos;s all this ?
sold it . i &apos;m done with it .
with the trailer ?
yep . don &apos;t need it anymore .
don &apos;t you need a place to sleep ,
or are you moving into my house , too , and no one told me ?
better . i just bought my own house .
closing it this morning .
amelia &apos;s been giving me a hard time
about getting a grown @-@ up house , so ...
so , no more trailer .
you &apos;re infected all over again .
wh-- sh-- is this -- should i have asked you ?
i should &apos;ve asked you .
no , no .
you paid for it .
it &apos;s yours to do what you want with .
you sure ?
yes .
congratulations on the new house .
thanks .
and once the infection spreads ,
once it gets into your bloodstream ,
then you really have to watch it .
&apos;cause that &apos;s the kind of infection ...
... that can kill you .
catherine &apos;s back in town next week .
thought it &apos;d be nice to have some people over .
nothing fancy -- just dinner .
who &apos;s in ?
you know , that &apos;s a fine idea , dr. webber .
sorry .
yes , yes , yes . thanks . absolutely .
okay . avery said yes .
how about you ? yeah , i &apos;ll be there .
okay . i &apos;m not sure about dr. warren &apos;s schedule , though .
okay . warren ?
yeah , i &apos;m in . all right .
what can i bring ?
i wouldn &apos;t say no to that artichoke dip
you brought to the resident mixer .
that &apos;s , -- that &apos;s miranda &apos;s secret recipe .
okay .
i see .
i &apos;ll bring it .
should be a great party .
maggie , did you hear that owen bought a house ?
good , now you can naked snuggle on his sofa .
wait . furniture . right . i need some of that . suction .
no black recliners , i beg you .
and nothing you have to assemble yourself .
you got a real house , get some real furniture ,
keep the momentum going .
maybe you should come shopping with me ,
point me in the right direction .
then you &apos;ll just wind up with a house full of furniture i like .
i don &apos;t see that as a problem .
i want stuff we both can enjoy .
wait . what ? why ?
is she -- are you moving in with him ?
duval forceps , please .
oh , no .
i @-@ i mean , that &apos;s not -- i don &apos;t think --
why not ? just think about it .
it &apos;s pretty big .
nice yard . good school district .
i &apos;m sorry . did you just go from moving in to having kids ?
boy , you guys move fast .
i couldn &apos;t even sleep in the same bed as my fianc√© .
we were engaged for a year .
long engagements -- bad idea .
i agree . better to go straight to the , marriage part .
it &apos;s better .
would you get married again ?
i &apos;d consider it , with the right person .
you would ?
i &apos;d strongly consider it , yes .
me too .
with the right person .
okay , then .
wait . what ?
did you j-- what just happened ?
are you engaged now ?
what ? no .
no .
hypotheticals .
we were just -- that was nothing .
we were just talking . we were just ...
maggie , we were just talking .
please . how long you think till you move out ?
who &apos;s moving out ?
amelia , when she marries owen hunt
and moves into his big , new , kid @-@ friendly house .
no , no . okay , hang on .
it was a hypothetical conversation .
that is it .
in which you were picking out hypothetical furniture
for your hypothetical children &apos;s hypothetical playroom .
it -- it was nothing .
can we drop it , please ?
why ?
gladly .
gladly ? why gladly ? what &apos;s wrong ?
do you see a dilation ?
i &apos;m worried about medullary sponge kidney .
you didn &apos;t answer my question .
you didn &apos;t answer mine .
you think we &apos;re moving too fast ?
is that it ?
amelia , please .
you &apos;re the one who pushed us back together .
you know , - you practically yelled at me
to run back into his arms , and now --
thanks for the consult .
i called the landlord ,
and he agreed to swap out our two @-@ bedroom lease
for something smaller , since ...
i mean , i figured that i could save on rent
while i &apos;m at preminger ,
so i can afford to fly back on weekends to seattle
to , you know , visit you and sofia .
okay .
okay ?
yeah , sounds good .
i don &apos;t want to leave when we &apos;re like this .
we &apos;ve barely talked since the trial .
i really don &apos;t know what to say .
neither do i , but i am trying to ...
say words and to be here and help .
you &apos;ve helped enough .
okay .
okay .
x @-@ rays came back clear .
no breaks .
we got lucky , nash .
so listen to your grandma the next time
she tells you not to climb the bookshelves , okay ?
all right .
thank you , doctor .
you have been so good with him today ,
so patient , and i can &apos;t help but notice
i don &apos;t see a ring on your finger .
excuse me ?
you should meet my daughter -- nash &apos;s mom .
not the sharpest tack ,
but really sweet , really pretty .
ma &apos;am , i appreciate the offer , but i &apos;m with someone already .
are you engaged ?
no .
are you getting engaged ?
i --
her number &apos;s in that chart .
i &apos;ll tell her to expect your call .
okay .
i think grandma over there
just arranged my marriage to her daughter .
there must be something in the air ,
because amelia and owen
are talking about getting married , too .
hey , maybe you guys could have a double wedding .
then i would only have to live through it once .
help ! please ! someone help ! it &apos;s okay , buddy . i got you .
okay , what happened ?
he passed out , he came to ,
and then he passed out again .
okay , let &apos;s get him down here .
there &apos;s another kid outside .
is this your son , sir ?
uh , no . i &apos;m his driver &apos;s ed teacher .
hey , i got it .
hey , there . you okay ?
can i -- can i park here ?
quit hovering and just go in there and talk to him .
he has made it very clear
he doesn &apos;t want me anywhere near him .
so , no .
does she have him on fluconazole in case it &apos;s fungal ?
you do realize that kyle can see you ?
it &apos;s not one @-@ way glass .
thank you .
kyle ?
oh , god .
i &apos;m fine .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine .
everything just ...
started spinning .
the -- the nausea &apos;s probably because of the antibiotics .
uh , i &apos;ll get dr. shepherd to get you an antiemetic .
why don &apos;t you just go ?
take that .
i don &apos;t need any help .
and i definitely don &apos;t want an audience for this .
then , um , let &apos;s pretend that you &apos;re puking
for some other reason , then .
like , um , after a show or something .
too many whiskey shots , you know ?
fun puking .
you &apos;re not hearing me .
i don &apos;t need any help from you .
look , i understand if you don &apos;t want to deal with me ,
but you are gonna need somebody .
does your friends ,
do your family know that you &apos;re here ?
that &apos;s none of your business , all right ?
i &apos;m not your business anymore .
okay .
but you &apos;re gonna need someone .
dr. shepherd took out your implant .
your tremor is gonna come back .
no kidding .
kyle , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m gonna puke again ...
now .
how about you just go ?
go . go !
i &apos;m g--
i &apos;m going .
dad , dad , i may have brushed against the wall , but --
good news , arvin . i see no signs of anything .
you &apos;re doing just fine .
and the doctor says i &apos;m fine .
yeah . the doctor .
well , it -- it was the wall of a hospital ,
but d @-@ didn &apos;t i say that ?
tell him that rhys had a medical emergency .
it &apos;s strep throat . that &apos;s not an emergency .
strep throat shouldn &apos;t cause you to faint .
are you on antibiotics ?
yeah , for two days . i &apos;m fine .
but , still , open up .
you passed out in a car .
you know how dangerous that is on the road ?
i wasn &apos;t even driving ! it was arvin !
has he passed out before ?
i don &apos;t know .
his mother would kill me if i let something happen to him .
aw , please don &apos;t talk about her .
it looks like rhys has a peritonsillar abscess .
i do need to drain it .
oh , no , no , you &apos;re not sticking that thing down my throat .
hey , hey , rhys , buddy , it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m here . all right ?
it &apos;s like i told you ,
i want you to think of me as a father .
why ? all my mom ever talks about
is when she &apos;s gonna break up with you .
what ?
hold on . hold on .
your mom &apos;s doing our driver &apos;s ed teacher ?
i came as soon as i got the message .
rhys , honey , are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
no , he &apos;s not okay , and neither am i.
you told him that you want to break up with me ?
is that true ?
you told him ?
this is way better than our last driver &apos;s ed class .
ready ? here we go .
be nice .
i know .
but , god , she put me through hell .
i know , and you won .
you can afford to be magnanimous .
hey , guys .
well , i , uh , was wondering if , um ...
i &apos;ve had a surgery come up later this week ,
and so i wanted to ask if i could please have sofia
tuesday night instead of thursday .
um , so if i allow you to have sofia on tuesday ,
then in exchange , i will have her friday ?
yeah , sure , if that &apos;s what you want .
great . okay , then i will make that work .
thank you .
she &apos;s gone .
i &apos;d lose that crazed smile before you start cramping .
yeah .
i am concerned about kyle .
you know , he &apos;s still septic .
his cultures are showing possible fungus .
he &apos;s also complaining of neck stiffness .
why are you talking to me about this ?
you operated three days ago .
why isn &apos;t he recovering ?
no . you are off this case .
you are not on my service today .
why are you talking to me about this ?
are you sure the infection
isn &apos;t because of the second lead you placed --
the one you had to convince us to get ?
him -- the one i convinced him to get
because he is my patient , not you .
i am just concerned .
and if you were the patient &apos;s family ,
i would want to assuage those concerns ,
but you are neither family nor friend right now .
he developed a complication .
complications happen , edwards .
we deal with them every day . today is no different .
white count is trending down , wound is clean ,
but his temp is still a little high .
hey , kyle , how you feeling ?
i was good until these two showed up .
it &apos;s been nag city for the last half @-@ hour .
well , maybe you should think about that the next time
you &apos;re in the hospital for three days without calling us .
i went through 19 hours of labor with you , without drugs .
you owe me at least a text or a &quot; tweep . &quot;
mom , it &apos;s a tweet , for the 10th time .
are you dr. shepherd ?
i am , yeah .
dr. shepherd recently removed the infected device
from kyle &apos;s brain , but you should be aware
that both the surgery and the antibiotics
aren &apos;t working as well as we expected .
i &apos;m sorry . who are you ?
i &apos;m dr. edwards .
i &apos;m one of the surgeons here .
this is her ?
this is her .
you can go .
kyle , if we could just talk --
why is she even here ?
i want her to go .
my son is not good enough for her .
she &apos;s not good enough for us .
my brother &apos;s broken a lot of hearts ,
but i &apos;ve never seen anyone break his .
and i got to think he &apos;d be better off if he &apos;d come in here
sooner instead of trying to avoid you .
so , please , do my family a favor and get the hell out of here .
thank you , dr. edwards . that will be all .
so , it &apos;s a basic decortication procedure ,
except there is a slight abnormality .
yeah , sorry , i can &apos;t take your decortication procedure
&apos;cause i already took it . just did the consult .
you just took my patient without telling me ?
you &apos;ve been pawning decortications off on me since i got here .
you hate them , so now i just take them ,
and you don &apos;t have to pawn .
thank you .
bacon ?
is that a box of bacon ?
bacon
a cardiothoracic hand grenade .
you know you &apos;re a doctor , right ?
a heart doctor .
it is good .
told you .
it &apos;s my job , isn &apos;t it ?
you got the big , fancy job ,
and you have no respect for mine .
are you trying to tell me that your life &apos;s ambitions
stopped after driver &apos;s ed teacher ?
do you know how many hours
the average american spends behind the wheel ...
oh , here we go .
... how many accidents there are every day ?
i am shaping the drivers of the future .
i &apos;m saving lives ! i &apos;m a freaking hero !
okay , superman . we get it , okay ?
hands at 10 and 2 .
yeah , except the recommended placement is 9 and 3 now .
9 and 3 !
see these two ?
you and wilson are doing it right ,
not rushing into things .
rushing into things ?
we &apos;ve been together a million years .
dr. karev ? dr. grey ?
had to put the screws to the x @-@ ray tech ,
but i got him to rush rhys &apos; films .
is that air around the trachea ?
i hope not .
it could be artifact , but we need a ct .
you &apos;re really great . you &apos;re -- you &apos;re clean , but ...
who &apos;s interrupting the happy couple to let mom know ?
i don &apos;t know . i was thinking right about now .
yeah , well , maybe i am , too .
oh , great . so now you &apos;re gonna break up with me ?
this is fantastic .
have fun .
jo , look , i need to know what is going on with kyle .
just tell me .
shepherd would kill me . his family would kill me .
jo , please . come on .
you have , what , four floors to tell me everything you know .
please . what is going on ?
okay , his symptoms aren &apos;t getting any better .
he &apos;s febrile with some headaches , a bit lethargic ,
and shepherd ordered a stat ct that showed evidence
of an abscess in the periventricular area .
okay .
uh , s-- so what is shepherd &apos;s plan ?
drainage and ventricular washout .
no . wh-- no . what ?
she wouldn &apos;t do that .
she knows how dangerous that can be .
she -- she can &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry . i have a ton of prep before surgery .
does -- does he know how dangerous it can be ?
big wedding or small wedding ?
well , not too small .
you want it to be a party .
so , um , kids ?
five .
five ?
sure .
unless the first few terrorize us .
then we can have four .
are we really talking about this ?
marriage and kids ?
no .
i mean , maybe one day , but no .
it was pretty fun watching maggie &apos;s face
in the o.r. , though .
yep .
you know , it is fun being fake married to you .
well , it &apos;s fun being fake married to you .
i have -- i have to prep for a surgery .
bye @-@ bye .
uh , knox asked me to cover for him
on that facial implant tomorrow .
cool with you ?
yeah , of course .
hey , look , um , if you need a place to crash ,
i still owe you and i still have a sofa .
why would i need your sofa ?
everything okay between you and bailey ?
yeah . fine .
no , you &apos;re still living in the same house ,
but you &apos;re not talking to each other , right ?
i &apos;m aware .
counseling ?
well , if we go to counseling , then we &apos;ll have to talk ,
and then we &apos;ll yell , so not talking is better .
so , what are you gonna do ?
do ?
well , yeah . you can &apos;t just stay like this .
oh , i can stay like this .
and i will . i am a very patient man .
and i am right , which makes me
even more patient since she is overreacting .
i know it and she knows it ,
though she &apos;s not ready to admit it yet .
so i am biding my time until she apologizes ,
at which point i will haul my ass
back into our bedroom where it belongs .
so -- so you &apos;re not mad ?
nah , man , i am pissed as hell ,
but she &apos;s the love of my life , so ...
i mean , you get it . you got april .
april and i are divorced .
well , like i said -- waiting game .
stay strong . you &apos;ll get there .
you &apos;re out of your damn mind .
yeah , i know .
oh , hey , bailey , i need to talk to you about warren .
oh , if this is about that dinner --
no , it -- it isn &apos;t . you know , i &apos;m just , um , concerned .
it &apos;s been a couple months now .
we &apos;ll be fine . look , it &apos;s a waiting game .
i &apos;m right , and once he remembers that &apos;s always the case ,
we &apos;ll be fine .
well , good .
and then maybe you would consider reinstating him --
sooner than later , okay ?
so when you said you were concerned ,
you meant you were concerned about you .
of course not .
um , sir , after the many years
i served under you as my chief ,
you must understand how difficult it is for me
when you force me to say , respectfully ,
this is not my problem
and , please , go do your damn job .
i don &apos;t think you found that difficult at all .
i &apos;ll probably end up hosting this wedding .
i hosted owen &apos;s last wedding . why not ?
what &apos;s it matter ? why do you care so much ?
i just wanted amelia to keep busy with something .
you know , like a hobby .
&apos;cause if she &apos;s talking owen &apos;s ear off ,
she can &apos;t talk off mine .
how does this change that ?
this means more talking .
only now it &apos;ll be about flowers and caterers
and what kind of dress i &apos;m gonna wear .
kill me now .
promise me you won &apos;t do this .
what ?
if jo ever pulls that ring out of that drawer ,
just go to vegas . elope or something .
don &apos;t put us through it all .
oh , no .
air pockets in the parapharyngeal space .
necrotizing fasciitis .
god , it &apos;s everywhere -- mediastinum , the heart .
there &apos;s no time . if it spreads any further ,
there won &apos;t be anything left to salvage .
i &apos;m gonna take him up to the o.r. right now .
i &apos;ll page jackson and cardio
and tell them to meet us up there .
they paged cardio .
you want it ?
i don &apos;t even know what it is .
it &apos;s a kid with strep throat
turned into nec fasc in the chest .
pretty cool .
not for the kid .
no , for the kid , it sucks .
does sound cool , though .
flip you for it .
is one of you gonna get in here , or what ?
uh , you know what ? you can have it .
i mean , you have seniority .
yes .
so i don &apos;t have to go in there if i don &apos;t want .
thought you wanted it .
this is an abuse of power .
this is a delegation of resources .
you &apos;re a very valuable resource .
oh , don &apos;t you flatter me now .
i have faith in you .
where mer &apos;s concerned ,
just , you know , give as good as you get .
i gave you bacon !
you &apos;re taking kyle in for a ventricular washout ?
hello , resident who is not on my service today .
there is an 85 % mortality rate .
if his abscess ruptures while he &apos;s on the table ,
he dies immediately .
edwards , you are really underfoot .
look , he just deserves all the time he can get ,
not some ... hail mary .
i mean , can you answer me , please , dr. shepherd ?
do you have this ?
okay , no , i am not answering that .
not simply because the patient and the family
have expressly asked you not be involved in this case ,
which would be enough ,
but more because i do not answer to you .
this is my surgical plan .
i am confident in my surgical plan .
end of discussion .
wilson , what ?
i just wanted to let you know
the o.r. will be ready in 45 minutes .
thank you .
for an average surgeon ,
sure , a ventricular washout could be a hail mary ,
but , edwards , this is me .
either come in or stay out ,
but don &apos;t do whatever it is you &apos;re doing .
okay .
i was thinking .
uh , maybe i can postpone leaving ...
for just a little while , just until things are better ,
until you and i are -- are better .
what &apos;s the point ?
what ? two days ? a week ?
we both know how this ends .
no , i don &apos;t .
but apparently you do , so why don &apos;t you enlighten me ?
all right , look , we &apos;ll drag this out . sure .
you can wait here
and things will get superficially better ,
and then you &apos;ll leave ,
and then we &apos;ll let things taper off the way things taper off
over long distance ,
and then we &apos;ll be sorry ,
and we &apos;ll make promises that are just lies .
it &apos;s all a lie ,
because i &apos;m not leaving without sofia ,
and you would never forgive me
if you gave up your grant ,
so i &apos;m stuck here , penny .
i am stuck , and there &apos;s no good solution .
callie , why won &apos;t you look at me ?
are you breaking up with me ?
is that it ?
maybe instead of dragging this out ...
maybe we should just call it now .
yeah , we should . you should go .
i told you to go .
and i &apos;m really bad at following directions .
i hurt you .
you sure did .
and i &apos;m so sorry about that .
boy , my sister really hates you .
yeah .
clearly , you told her all about me .
well , to be fair , i told her all the good stuff first .
i &apos;ve missed you .
yeah ?
well , relax .
like , i mean , not like sad or , like ,
you know , love @-@ sick miss you .
i manly miss you .
like , i &apos;m very tough .
look , i talked to dr. shepherd about your surgery .
and she &apos;s got this .
you &apos;re gonna make it through this .
i know it .
that &apos;s great , because i look way hotter
when i &apos;m not in a hospital gown .
yeah , i remember .
so , what &apos;s our plan ...
with you and i after all this is over ?
what ?
yeah , when i &apos;m well
and i &apos;m done with this place ,
we should go away together .
i can &apos;t go somewhere .
come on . have fun .
live a little .
okay . like where ?
i have a bunch of gigs lined up in europe .
come on tour with me for like a month .
i &apos;m a surgeon , not a groupie .
come on . you know you want to see me play .
i do , actually .
but , you know ,
i &apos;d probably just embarrass you ,
acting a fool , you know ,
screaming your name in the front row .
i &apos;m excited to see that .
no , you think you are .
you have not seen me act like a fool .
i &apos;d throw my bra on the stage .
please do that .
shut up .
listen ...
i , um ...
i am in this ...
kind of deep with you ,
so just ...
don &apos;t say these things if you don &apos;t mean them , okay ?
okay .
i have to take him to surgery .
oh , yeah . okay , it &apos;s invaded the pleural space .
chest wall &apos;s involved .
we &apos;ll debride the top layer off .
go deeper .
get the pericardium if you have to .
i don &apos;t want to peel this kid down to nothing .
and i don &apos;t want this kid to
have to go through all this and still be infected .
go deeper !
grey , come on .
sorry . i &apos;ve had enough of bad decisions today .
yeah , well , what did i do ?
relax , mate .
it &apos;s probably me .
no , she &apos;s just pissed that
shepherd and hunt are getting married .
really ?
that &apos;s nice , actually .
they &apos;re not . they had a conversation .
all right , so she &apos;s pissed about them getting married someday .
why &apos;s that ?
there &apos;s a kid on the table
whose flesh is being eaten alive right in front of us .
can we please just focus ?
well , if you want to hand me a half a cup of drano ,
i &apos;ll get it done in a jiffy .
you think that &apos;s funny ?
little bit .
i &apos;m trying to say we &apos;re well aware
of who &apos;s on the table and what the stakes are .
we &apos;re all working as fast as we can .
we &apos;re all on the same page , grey .
you &apos;re not more interested
in saving a life than the rest of us .
mayo .
antibiotic irrigation .
what &apos;d you have ?
young kid with advanced nec fasc .
i just hope i got it all .
i hear you .
i &apos;ve got a ventricular washout on a massive brain abscess .
sounds last @-@ ditch . sorry .
well , not necessarily . i ... feel pretty good about it .
okay .
i do .
well , you feel really good about a lot of things , so ...
what does that mean ?
nothing .
just -- just forget about it .
is it a problem for you , owen and me ?
is that -- is that what you &apos;re talking about ?
let &apos;s not . you have surgery .
i can handle it .
can you ?
because it seems like
like what ?
like you don &apos;t even see it .
you think you &apos;re making all these choices
and building this life when none of this is actually yours .
that doesn &apos;t even make sense .
it does make sense . you are living in my house ,
helping to take care of my children with my sister .
you are marrying my best friend &apos;s ex .
you are trying to do my husband &apos;s job .
you know , you used to have humility ,
even a little anxiety ,
and now you even have his confidence .
but why not ?
because you &apos;ve taken over everything else .
what are you saying ?
get your own life .
you have surgery .
noah , you really don &apos;t have to stay here .
listen , this may all be nothing to you ,
but it doesn &apos;t mean that i don &apos;t care ,
okay , about you and the kid .
i didn &apos;t say it was nothing .
oh , right . sorry . sex .
you were using me for my stick shift .
noah , for god &apos;s sake , that is not what i said .
excuse me . we have an update .
okay .
the surgery went well .
we believe we were able
to resect all of the infected tissue .
rhys was very lucky .
if you hadn &apos;t brought him in when you did ,
we probably wouldn &apos;t have been so successful .
okay .
okay .
it &apos;s okay .
thank you .
he &apos;s gonna be okay .
he &apos;s here because of you .
he would &apos;ve died , and he didn &apos;t
because of you . right ?
yeah , kind of . um , yeah .
you are a hero .
i mean , i just did what needed to be done .
no .
okay .

i &apos;ll do whatever i want .
yeah ? well , so will i !
me too .
well , what do you want ?
when do you know
you &apos;ve put something to bed ?
when is it finally safe to move on ?
maybe you never know .
maybe you just have to test the water .
you have to see how it feels .
okay , this could make things a little --
just shut up .
and if it feels good , i mean , really good ,
then , hell , i say go for it .
