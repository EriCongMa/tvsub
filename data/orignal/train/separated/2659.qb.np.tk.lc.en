given her abrupt drop in blood pressure and pulse ,
i diagnosed a placental abruption .
we performed a successful emergency c @-@ section .
she was having chest pains , shortness of breath --
classic symptoms of an amniotic fluid embolism .
her lungs were no longer functioning .
i had to get her to a trauma unit .
we were losing her .
and she went into arrest .
that &apos;s enough .
i kept her alive long enough to become a mother .
what a desperate thing to say .
i don &apos;t want to die .
everyone dies someday .

you &apos;re okay .
talk to me .
it &apos;s not that he died .
it &apos;s not even the way he died .
it &apos;s in the things i said to him ...
just before he died .
hello ?
you okay ?
there &apos;s someone here . outside .
he &apos;s here to kill me .
there . there he is .
see his shadow ?
stay away from the window .
i found the intruder .
he put up a fight .
i had no choice but to kill him .
you must think i &apos;m crazy .
no .
we &apos;ll have hot water soon .
there &apos;s wine .
and i can make a risotto .
do you think we &apos;ll have hot water tonight ?
by the time we finish dinner , it should be hot .
this is superb .
the rice is just right .
canned mushrooms .
best i could do .
it &apos;s excellent .
you aren &apos;t hungry .
who &apos;s trying to kill you ?
does it have something to do with what you told me before ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
you said you lost someone .
harsh words were spoken .
words you regret .
i was out of my mind .
there was no one .
just me .
you don &apos;t have to lie .
neither do you .
you &apos;re no hungrier than i am .
you &apos;re not enjoying a single bite of that .
i told you this is -- - superb .
the quality of the cooking is wholly irrelevant
in this case , isn &apos;t it ?
given the circumstances .
and those are ?
you tell me .
tell yourself .
say it out loud .
it was a hobson &apos;s choice .
there was a woman and her child .
both were doomed .
both would die .
i could either save one or lose both .
i chose the child .
it was ...
it was the worst thing i &apos;ve ever had to do in my life .
worst thing by far .
you didn &apos;t have a choice .
there &apos;s always a choice .
i was arrogant .
i presumed that there was an order to things ,
that there was --
that if i nourished and protected
and taught the child ,
she would be safe ...
... and happy .
and she was neither .
no matter what i tried to do ,
all i brought her was misery and violence , and eventually --
death .
yes .
and now you &apos;re dead .
you believe there &apos;s nothing left for you .
it &apos;s that obvious ?
nothing about you is obvious .
what brought you here ?
i honestly don &apos;t know .
you &apos;ve been here before .
once , a long time ago .
i was a very different person then .
you ?
what can i do for you , officer ... duncan ?
we got a call from a neighbor .
he noticed lights inside .
oh , yeah . i was afraid that might happen .
that &apos;s why the candles -- didn &apos;t want to alarm anyone .
i take it you &apos;re not trespassing .
oh , good god , no .
jack and ida are old family friends .
offered the place for the weekend .
mind showing some identification ?
no , no , no . no problem .
i &apos;ll be right back .
if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d prefer waiting inside .
of course . my mistake .
please , please .
it &apos;s a bit chilly out .
wait here . i &apos;ll get my i.d.
i &apos;m sorry you had to come all the way out here
on such a cold night .
didn &apos;t mention you had a friend .
yeah . my wife , abigail .
she &apos;s feeling a little under the weather .
didn &apos;t touch a bite , it looks like .
no .
i can go upstairs and wake her , if you &apos;d like .
no . no , that &apos;s okay .
everything appears in order .
you said you &apos;re a friend of jack and ida &apos;s .
yes , i said i was a friend .
poor jack .
miss the hell out of that man .
yeah , yeah . it &apos;s a crying shame .
ida just hadn &apos;t been able to keep the place up
since he passed .
enjoy your stay , mr. donnelly .
thank you , officer .
he knows .
i don &apos;t think so .
he &apos;d have to be very good at hiding it .
we &apos;ll see .
water should be hot .
how did you know jack was dead ?
i didn &apos;t say he was dead .
i said i missed him .
still , why would you miss him ?
state of the place .
hasn &apos;t been maintained .
a man wouldn &apos;t let that happen if he was around .
you said &quot; poor jack &quot; ?
jack &apos;s shack .
he took pride in that .
decorated it , carved his name on it .
it &apos;s falling apart .
i figured he was either sick or dead .
could have been ida .
i went with jack .
men don &apos;t usually last as long as women .
you sound like an actuary .
i am , in a way .
have you ever killed anyone ?
that &apos;s an odd question .
have you ?
yes .
many .
but never anyone who didn &apos;t deserve it .
me , too .
i know .
how ?
there aren &apos;t a lot of us .
you learn to recognize it .
yes .
behind you .
you all right ?
yeah . thank you .
you know him ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
he &apos;s one of them .
not the first , not the last .
why did you go into the water ?
what made you decide ?
you &apos;ve never killed anyone who didn &apos;t deserve it .
yes .
that is a fine thing .
a noble thing .
but not terribly difficult .
that &apos;s true .
have you ever spared someone who deserved to die ?
there was a woman i loved .
she was ...
my life .
my heart .
and she died .
she left behind a little girl .
one last , precious piece of herself .
she &apos;ll need protection .
only if you &apos;re in her life .
go .
stay away .
i won &apos;t let you make the same mistake with her ...
... that you made with liz .
i would give anything
to be a part of that child &apos;s life ,
but a man made it clear i would never see her ...
hold her ...
watch her grow .
and i knew in that moment ,
i would never be any part
of that beautiful little girl &apos;s life .
because ...
he was her father .
and to harm him would be to harm her .
a mortal sin .
her mother is gone .
the father is what she has left in the world .
her father .
yes .
gregory , do you copy ?
did you copy that ?
we don &apos;t have much time .
they &apos;re coming .
this &apos;ll work .
i &apos;ll drive .
i &apos;m not leaving without you .
yes , you are .
no . i &apos;m not .
those men are after me .
it &apos;s my problem , not yours .
you made it my problem
the moment you walked into the ocean .
i didn &apos;t ask for your help .
let me go .
no .
why not ?
what difference does it make to you ?
have you ever seen the aftermath of a suicide bombing --
we &apos;re wasting time .
i have .
june 29 , 2003 .
i was meeting two associates
at the marouche restaurant in tel aviv .
as my car was pulling up ,
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old palestinian
named ghazi safar entered the restaurant
and detonated a vest wired with c4 .
let me go .
the shock wave knocked me flat , blew out my eardrums .
i couldn &apos;t hear .
the smoke --
it was like being underwater .
i went inside .
a nightmare .
blood .
parts of people .
you could tell where safar was standing
when the vest blew .
it was like a perfect circle of death .
there was almost nothing left
of the people closest to him .
17 dead , 46 injured .
blown to pieces .
the closer they were to the bomber ,
the more horrific the effect .
stop .
that &apos;s every suicide .
every single one .
an act of terror perpetrated against everyone
who &apos;s ever known you --
everyone who &apos;s ever loved you .
the people closest to you -- the ones who cherish you --
are the ones who suffer the most pain ,
the most damage .
why would you do that ?
why would you do that to people who love you ?
i have no choice .
there &apos;s always a choice .
is there ?
that little girl .
the one you told me about ?
the one whose father you spared ?
what would you do if you knew -- knew --
that as long as you drew breath ,
as long as you continued to exist ,
her life would be in danger ?
she would be hunted , and she would be killed .
what would you do ?
what would you do ?
my child is being raised by someone else .
i am her mother ...
and i am death to her .
so this is what i &apos;m doing .
i never wanted this .
i know .
then go .
i can &apos;t .
you still have time to go .
i don &apos;t know your name .
don &apos;t be ridiculous , raymond .
you okay ?
we need to clean up and clear out .
you get the car .
there &apos;s something wrong !
hello ?
where are you ?
no . no , no , no .
hey !
did you see a woman walk into the water ?
no .
i didn &apos;t see no woman .
you sure ?
yeah . i &apos;m sure .
mister , the only living soul
i &apos;ve seen on this stretch in over two weeks is just you .
just me .
yep .
canned mushrooms .
best i could do .
behind you .
just me .
yep .
just you .
hello .
could i , please ?
please . i want to buy it .
ain &apos;t worth anywhere near that .
it is to me .
okay , then .
to katarina , love papa .
you had no choice .
it was me or masha .
i &apos;m sorry .
raymond , you did save me .
through her .
it was the only way .
you chose well .
hey , mister !
you okay ?
seem a little lost .
there &apos;s someone i need to see .
