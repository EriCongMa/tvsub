What?
Nothing.
You look... presidential.
From your mouth to God's ear.
Look at Eli Gold in tails.
What?
Wow, the men are really sensitive tonight.
You look good, Eli.
I swear, if you start clocking my alcohol intake,
I am going to do shots.
Okay.
Now, would we all like to know our goal
for this Shamrock Dinner?
To have a good time?
No.
At the end of the night,
Cardinal James is going to make a choice.
He's going to shake hands with one candidate
and he's going to hug the other.
Historically, that hug means a bump of 800,000
Catholic votes.
You need those votes to beat Kresteva.
So, I shouldn't mention abortion?
Alicia, you are Saint Alicia.
I know you don't like that, but you are.
So, please, tonight, just go with it.
You're seen as a paragon of faithful wives.
You stood by your man, you never strayed...
Good evening, everyone.
Hey, Will.
Peter, hi.
Thanks for the invite.
No, thank you.
I never got a chance to thank you
for promoting Alicia to partner.
Oh, well, no thanks necessary.
Everything she earned, she earned on her own.
Okay.
I'm going to go find a bar.
Can I have a red wine please?
Alicia Florrick.
Mike Kresteva.
Happy Saint Patrick's Day.
I thought I'd find you at the bar.
Club soda, lime, no ice.
Oh, that's right, you can't drink.
Not can't, don't.
Still holding a grudge, are we?
What grudge?
You didn't do something wrong, did you?
Bob, Margot.
No, I didn't.
You're in a funny mood.
Well, I have decided life is too short not to be honest.
Mm, let's see how that goes.
What's your husband's strategy for beating me?
Using me.
My status with women to take the female vote.
I like this side of you.
And what about me are you worried most about?
Your psychopathic ability to lie and pretend it's the truth.
Really?
You do Mein Kampf proud.
You know, there must be some kind of
conversational equivalent to Godwin's Law,
because we've been talking for less than a minute
and you've already compared me to Hitler.
You know the problem with bad people,
is they use the arguments of good people.
The problem with good people is they think
of themselves as good people.
Okay, well, this has been fun.
Die choking on your own blood, please.
That's nice.
Mrs. Florrick, do you have a minute?
Ah, is something wrong?
No, we just need to talk to you for a few minutes,
if you don't mind.
Is there something I can help you with, detective?
No, thank you, sir.
Uh, ma'am.
Your Eminence.
Mike, how are you?
Beautiful evening, isn't it?
It is that.
What was that all about.
Oh, Mrs. Florrick?
The detective just asked her to go with him.
Peter Florrick's wife.
That's odd.
I hope she's all right.
Well, I hope it's not about her son again.
What is it?
We have a time sensitive matter
and we need you to look at some evidence.
Is it my kids?
No, ma'am.
Uh, one of your clients was murdered tonight.
Oh, my God.
That's your client?
Yes.
Matthew Ashbaugh?
And do you recognize that man?
No.
Do you recognize the vehicle?
No. When did this happen?
Three hours ago, on State Street.
Did Mr. Ashbaugh have any enemies?
Yes.
He did, who?
Many.
Okay, the thing is, Mrs. Florrick,
our worry is that that man
is still out there.
We have reason to believe he's not done killing tonight.
You have reason?
Evidence.
At the scene.
I can't go into detail at this time.
Keep it down, please.
Lawsuits often breed grudges, Mrs. Florrick.
So, could you tell us what cases you worked on with him?
Well, there were 18.
18 cases?
Yes.
And how many were ongoing?
Eighteen.
He was very...
litigious.
Doug. Come on.
Okay, I have to interview a witness right now.
Could you write down anyone who was an enemy?
Anyone you think might want him dead.
Why do you want to sue?
His dog's barking.
That must be difficult for you.
What are the damages?
Loss of "consor-tium."
Consortium.
Loss of consortium.
With who?
Somebody I might want to consort with.
You're laughing at me.
Why are you laughing at me?
Because you seem intent on making enemies.
You can't sue the phone company.
This is America; You can sue anybody.
We're not done with your other two lawsuits.
It's called multitasking, Alicia.
Now, look at me, I am talking to you
and I am designing the architecture
for new encryption software.
Well, you are much smarter than me.
Well, maybe I should look for another lawyer.
Yes, please.
Fire me.
Please.
No, no.
Oh, no.
You're not getting away from me that easily.
Alicia, this is Mr. Matthew Ashbaugh,
the designer of Baugh Tech,
a web-based streaming program.
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.
Why?
Why... is it a pleasure to meet you?
Because you're a wealthy new client
and I want to make a good impression.
You--
You travel with your own soundtrack?
Yes.
Don't you?
No.
Well, I'll leave you two to get better acquainted.
My problem isn't the music.
My problem is the music over and over.
You don't like Bach?
I love Bach.
But I don't love the same Bach song
over and over.
Mrs. Florrick, "Bach song"?
Why do the smartest people hide their learning?
To compensate for those who show off their learning.
I play the same "Bach song"
because then they'll get bored and stop listening to me.
Ah. So, the CIA is listening to you?
Mm, the bliss of the unparanoid.
Lucky me.
So, how we doing?
All of these?
Did he have any altercations with any of these enemies?
You're lying...!
Any exchange of words?
He's dying!
No, no.
Little Sparky is dying!
Alicia!
You're killing him!
Stop!
Ted, you got a minute?
Okay, Mrs. Florrick,
we're just trying to narrow focus.
Did he ever say someone was out to kill him?
You laugh now, Mrs. Florrick.
I do laugh now.
But one day you'll be identifying my body in a morgue,
then you'll know.
What-what will I know?
That everything I've said is true.
He said that?
And-and what was he referring to?
He said that Mossad was out to kill him.
One of his ongoing cases was against
Chicago P.D. for harassment, correct?
Yes.
Can you tell us what he said about that?
May I make a phone call?
Now?
Yes.
Why?
I need to make a phone call.
Alicia? Where are you?
What?
Who is that?
It's Alicia.
She says Ashbaugh's dead.
Ashbaugh?
Our Ashbaugh?
He was murdered on State Street.
Ho-hold on, Alicia.
Hold on.
Can you hear us now?
Yes. They want me to talk about our cases
to help them find the killer.
Our-our cases with Ashbaugh?
Yes.
Including the police harassment case.
You worried about attorney-client privilege?
Yes.
Are we still bound,
given our client's new status?
Uh, the privilege survives death.
With some exceptions.
I don't think this merits.
With survivor approval?
Okay, we'll try and contact the surviving family,
see if they'll give an allowance.
In the meantime, be circumspect.
You can talk about anything shared outside
the attorney-client relationship, but not covered.
Diane?
Do you have a minute, Peter needs a word.
I, uh... sure.
Call you back.
Nice court attire?
It impresses the judges.
So, Diane, I wanted to thank you
for your debate-prep help.
It was indispensable.
It was fun.
I'm not sure I'll be a great stand-in for Kresteva.
That's true.
So...?
So, you're aware that Justice Ludwig
was killed in a car accident two weeks ago?
Yes, we represented his wife.
That's right. Which leaves open a Supreme Court seat.
Which tradition leaves to the governor to fill.
You want me to offer some names?
No, I want you to offer your name.
I think that's a positive response.
No, I'm just...
You... you want me...
Yes.
To be a Supreme Court justice?
Yes.
Your politics mesh with Peter's.
You know people with money
and your name means something
to the people we want to court...
More importantly, I think you'd make a damn good judge.
I am bowled over.
Great. So, say yes.
I, um...
I have a business.
Yeah, you'll have to relinquish that.
That is, if I win.
Um... how long do I have to decide?
Till this evening.
Tonight?
Well, unfortunately, I'm getting a lot of pressure
from the Democratic Committee to pick somebody else,
so I need my candidate tonight.
I understand.
Okay.
So, uh...
that gives me three hours.
Two and a half.
So, you know why I'm here.
I can guess.
They're afraid I'll fall back
on my attorney-client privilege,
and you're here, as my friend,
to coax me into disclosing?
Yes. And being a lawyer myself,
I can walk you through
why it's not attorney-client privilege.
Because the client is deceased?
Among other things.
The other things being, you can help find the killer.
Seems particularly in the client's interest.
I talked to my partners,
and they would like me to be circumspect.
Okay. So, did your client ever mention
someone by the name of Edward Lomax,
or Eddie Lomax?
Why?
We're looking into a lot of leads.
It's just one such lead.
Eddie Lomax?
You bring up Lomax again,
and I'll kill you, you hear me?
Unfortunately,
I... can't deny
or confirm any such mention,
due to attorney-client privilege.
Okay.
One more question.
How you doing?
How am I doing? Good. You?
Good. Need a ride back to your party?
Yeah. Um, I should probably call my husband
and tell him where I am.
Good. And, um...
maybe we can talk sometime later?
Sure. What about?
Advice. Nothing really.
Peter. Hi.
Uh, sorry about that.
No, something with a client.
I'll be back in a minute.
How's it going?
Oh, it-it's going good, I think.
He's free, he's free. Come on.
Oh. A-All right.
Eli's prodding me, I'm gonna have to go.
So I'll see you when-when you get back.
Okay, bye.
God.
All right, all right, all right.
Your Eminence.
Mr. State's Attorney, what an honor.
Oh, no, no, no. The honor is mine.
And your lovely wife-- where is she?
Uh, I was just on the phone with her.
She was called away for a moment,
but she'll be right back.
Yes, I'm sorry for the difficulty.
The... the difficulty?
My nephew had the same issues.
But I'm glad you're facing it head-on.
Drug addiction is a... a difficult thing.
You all set?
Yeah.
Are you gonna be okay riding a motorcycle in that?
You don't have a motorcycle.
No, but wouldn't it be great if I did?
Mrs. Florrick?
I need to...
Come with me, please.
We found the car, the killer's car.
Great. So, we're halfway home.
There's a problem. Car had a GPS.
We ran the address the killer entered into it.
Okay?
It was your apartment, Mrs. Florrick.
Hello?
Grace, I... Is, .....?
Are you all right?
Yeah, sorry, we were just in the other room.
So, everything there is all right?
Is Zach with you?
Yeah. Why? Are you at the party?
Yes. Uh, no.
Grace, I need you to do something for me.
You know the Vermas on the fourth floor?
I need the two of you to go there right now.
They're on vacation.
Mom, what's wrong?
Ugh. Okay.
Go downstairs to Zach's car, and drive over to Grandma's.
Well, Grandma's here.
She's... she's there? Jackie?
Oh, no. Your mom.
Is that Alicia?
She got us presents.
Okay, Grace, I need...
Oh, oh, boom.
Oh, that's so bad.
Put your grandma on the phone.
She wants to talk to you.
Alicia. I just dropped by.
I brought them some more
age-appropriate presents this time.
Mom... I need you to do something for me.
It's very serious.
I want you to drive the kids
to your hotel, okay? Please?
Now? You want me to take them now?
Yes.
There's a situation. There may be danger at my apartment.
The police are on their way,
but with the parade on State Street...
Kids, get your stuff together.
We're going over to my hotel.
Thanks, Mom. Can you put Zach on the phone?
Sure. You have such an exciting life.
Zach?
Hey, Mom. She's fine. She's not causing any trouble.
I know, but I need you to do something for me.
Uh, Grandma's not that...
responsible, and, um...
But Saint Patrick's Day, she can be a bit crazy.
She's all right.
I know.
Um, but if she asks you to do something...
...that doesn't make sense, you can disobey her.
Okay? I want you to disobey her.
But right now, I want you out of the apartment.
I have to go. I'll talk to you later.
That your kids?
Everything all right?
Yes.
You know attorney-client privilege may be waived
if the attorney's life is in danger.
I heard Ashbaugh mention... Edward Lomax.
You bring up Lomax again,
and I'll kill you, you hear me?
Or someone mentioned it to him.
An Officer Nozowitz.
Do you think this had anything
to do with your lawsuit against the department for harassment?
I don't know.
But I witnessed Nozowitz throwing my client...
against the wall and threatening to
kill him if he ever mentioned
Eddie Lomax again.
Okay, thanks. That's really helpful.
I'll be right back.
Still no word from Ashbaugh's family.
What was that about?
What? What about?
You and Eli and Peter.
He, uh...
He asked me to take the empty seat of Justice Ludwig.
He...? Really?
Yes.
Yes, but it-it would mean stepping away from the...
our partnership.
When did you get religious?
Why is that so weird?
No, it's not weird.
It's just unusual for our family.
Is it your father?
Is what my father?
The religion thing.
No, it's all her.
Oh, you know, Grace, your father has issues.
It's always the philanderers who go to Jesus.
Oh, no! The car's blocked!
Zach, where's your car?
Mine's blocked in, too.
Okay. Over there.
That's a bar.
Oh, don't worry. They'll let you in.
Come on. We'll sit in the bar and wait
until the cars get unblocked.
Come. Look, I'm not trying to get you drunk.
I'm trying to get you warm.
Come on. Let's go.
We're bringing Sergeant Nozowitz in for questioning,
and we'll get you some security.
Thanks.
I'll wait here with you if you don't mind.
Please.
So, what was the advice?
Before...
you said you needed some advice?
Oh, no. Some other time.
What other time?
You're here, I'm here.
And we're being serenaded.
What do you think of Will Gardner?
What do I think?
Yes. He's not seeing anybody, is he?
No. I don't think so. Why?
I don't know.
Sometimes I think he's pursuing me.
Then other times...
Is he reluctant because
we're on the opposite side of cases, is that it?
I mean, we've faced each other a few times, but not a lot.
I don't know.
I hate this stuff.
It's so high school, you know?
Are you sure he's not seeing someone?
Yes.
Does he know that you and I are friends?
I-I... I don't know. Why?
You should ask him out.
Ugh. I knew you were gonna say that.
Laura, ask him out. Seriously.
I think he'd be receptive.
And if you ever need advice from me sometime...
I'll yell.
Yeah. Oh. Oh!
The restrooms?
Uh, those doors.
Nozowitz.
She said your name--Nozowitz.
I barely knew the guy.
You got to be kidding.
She fingered me?!
Uh, she said you got into a fight with him.
He's better off dead.
He deserved it.
You're not wearing green.
A pinch to grown an inch.
Me? I'm a massage therapist.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Kalinda, I need your help.
Right now?
If you can.
Be right there.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us...
So you're the one spreading the rumors.
Oh, I'm the one?
What rumors are we talking about here, Eli?
Zach Florrick being arrested on the drugs charge.
Uh, Ben, can I get a bottle of water?
I saw Mrs. Florrick being talked to by two policemen,
and then, I overheard the detective mention pot
and Zach Florrick,
and that's what I repeated when asked.
That's a lie.
Yeah. What is it with you people calling everyone a liar?
Sometimes the truth doesn't bend to your will.
Sometimes things happen which you wish hadn't.
It's such a pointless lie, too.
Zach wasn't arrested.
The facts on the ground will contradict you immediately,
so... why?
Just because Peter can intimidate the state's attorney
into not prosecuting does not mean an arrest for pot didn't happen.
You're good.
Oh. Yeah? You think so?
Peter can't deny this lie.
Why? Because his son was pulled over
by Madison County PD who found marijuana shake
in his car, and then,
Peter intimidated the state's attorney
into dropping the charges?
You mean, that's why it's hard for Peter to deny?
Oh, we missed you.
I know. I'll call you.
This will be a battle to the death.
No. You know why it won't?
'Cause I got the truth on my side,
and the truth always wins.
Look, Kalinda...
Cary, come on, it's important.
I can't say anything. It's confidential.
All I want to know is that
when you were at the state's attorney's office,
did you investigate Sergeant Nozowitz?
I leave Lockhart/Gardner,
I can't use what I know
to benefit the state's attorney's office.
When I leave the state's attorney's office,
I can't use it to benefit Lockhart/Gardner.
Yeah.
Look, our client, Ashbaugh, was murdered.
I heard.
The killer's vehicle was found,
and Alicia's address was in the GPS.
We investigated Nozowitz for corruption.
Taking drug money.
I.A.D. was looking into him and they asked us to consult.
Okay, and... and do you know anything
about a man by the name of Edward Lomax?
Yeah. Drug dealer.
He was shot and killed in the Fifth Ward.
He has nothing to do with Nozowitz.
Well, Nozowitz seemed worried about having his name
associated with this dead drug dealer.
I'd be careful, Kalinda.
Thanks.
...dance music coming up
a little later in the evening,
and I hope to see each and every one of you
out on that dance floor.
That's not good.
No. And that's the only time
you saw Nozowitz with Ashbaugh?
Yes.
Did Ashbaugh ever mention anything to you about corruption?
No. I mean, the usual stuff.
No, the police connection
to Mossad and the Unabomber.
All right. And what about the Fifth Ward murder,
did he mention anything to you about that?
Um, I got to go.
I'll call you back.
Matthew, you act as if I'm omnipotent.
I can't get you everything.
I'm just asking for the police report, that's all.
Get your investigator on it.
She's on a lot of other things.
W-What is the case again?
A shooting in the Fifth Ward.
Alicia, are you there? Hello?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Alicia, this is life and death here.
The Fifth Street Ward shooting.
Can you have someone look into it?
Yes.
Um, Matthew, I'm...
I'm going into a meeting.
Can I get back to you?
Yes. But get back to me quick.
Okay.
Everything all right?
Uh, what? Yeah, um...
What is-- what do you mean?
No, no, no, you just-- you seemed far away.
We located Sergeant Nozowitz.
We're questioning him now.
Good. Good.
Good.
'Kay.
Why's he want a police report?
Probably thinks we can use it
in our suit against the Chicago PD.
You're suing the police again?
Will.
You're the one who gave him to me.
Can you see what you can find out?
About this ward shooting? What about Kalinda?
She's busy.
Please.
He's driving me crazy.
What do I get?
What do you get?
Yeah. What do I get?
David Lee becomes name partner?
No.
Then who?
Ugh. I don't like talking about this.
Why?
It feels like I'm cheating on you.
You found someone better.
Go with Gardner & Associates.
You don't need another name partner.
Hello.
Alicia?
Yeah, still no luck.
What?
They found my address in his GPS.
Your...
I'm coming down.
No. No, Will.
No. I'm fine.
I was just wondering if you remember Ashbaugh
wanting information about a murder.
I'm coming down.
I'll see you in 20 minutes.
Will, it's okay.
Alicia, you may be the target of a murderer.
I'm coming down.
Do you want me to tell Peter?
No, no, no. He'll want to come, too,
and he needs to concentrate on tonight.
Okay, I'll see you in a minute
Well, I'm gonna go talk to him.
Peter, you can't.
He just lied about Zach.
Yes, but the problem is,
it's a lie with a bad fact.
You intimidated the Madison County state's attorney
on exactly this kind of pot charge.
There is no pot charge!
You know the way to battle a lie?
With the truth.
No.
With a bigger lie.
Peter. Eli.
Mike.
What?
What are you doing?
I have to go to the men's room.
Peter. Let it go.
Let what go?
I have to go to the men's room.
I love Irish songs.
I think I'm secretly Irish.
Oh, you know, they have that genetic test
that tells you what nationalities
are in your background.
I think I'm Moroccan, Italian and Irish.
Alicia keep you on a pretty short leash?
No.
Yeah, you go off on a lot of adventures, don't you?
I have a boyfriend.
Oh, my God.
I didn't know he was your boyfriend.
Since when?
Since he asked me.
That's not what you said to Mom.
You said he wasn't.
Have you kissed?
Yeah.
Young men are such great kissers.
They're so anxious.
It's like food to them.
You didn't tell Mom you slept with Becca.
Grace.
What?
You said I didn't tell Mom.
Why is it okay for you and not for me?
We're all family here.
Have you slept with him?
No.
There's nothing wrong with that.
I mean, your mom was pregnant with you
when she got married.
What?
Oh, you mean you didn't know?
Yeah, she was two months pregnant.
She was not. The date was two months after.
No, they changed the date.
I remember when she called your grandfather.
"Oh, Daddy, Daddy, what are we gonna do?"
And he said, "Do you love him?"
Your mother was very adventurous when she was your age.
She liked the bad boys.
Peter.
Mike.
How's your son?
Eli tells me you're worried
about what I'm saying.
Are you worried about what I'm saying?
No. No, I'm not worried.
I mean, I think you'll say
whatever helps you.
I think you'll say whatever you want reality to be.
But you're not provoked.
Is that what you're trying to do, is to provoke me?
Nah, it just seems that
people have their limits.
Either their wives, kids or moms.
In your case, maybe all three.
Am I being funny?
No, I was just remembering that Eli said
the way to battle a lie is to make a bigger lie.
Oh, and you disagree.
No.
You know the way to battle a lie?
No, but I have a feeling you're gonna...
Are you crazy?
Actually, this is the one moment I'm not.
You can't hit me.
You're right.
You're right, so I must not have.
You just did.
Are you sure?
It makes no sense for me to hit you.
My nose is bleeding.
I'm on the floor, my nose is bleeding!
Yeah, I can see that.
But there must be some other reason for it.
No, no, no...
I'll-I'll sue you.
Good idea.
I'll see you outside.
Gentlemen, would you go up and see
if Mr. Kresteva is all right?
I'm afraid he's had too much to drink and he fell down.
Yes, sir.
That's a Cheshire smile.
No, that's a real smile.
It's James Bond.
Alicia, are you all right?
Yes. You didn't need to come down here.
I know. What are they saying?
The police?
Nothing to me.
But I think it has something to do
with the murder in the Fifth Ward.
I looked into it.
The cops never found the shooter.
It was a drug theft.
Eight pounds of coke missing.
How was the party?
Loads of fun.
You look good.
I do?
Thanks.
You do, too.
No, you really look good.
Rushing down here.
We were good together, weren't we?
Yes.
We're keeping each other from moving on.
No. We're fine.
No, we're not.
It's past and I'm pretending that it's not.
Alicia, I'm fine.
We have a residual something or other,
and we're dealing with it.
I'm being selfish.
I mean, even talking about it here, I'm being selfish.
I'm back with Peter.
Now this has to end.
Can you just decide that?
I can.
I have to.
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone. Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Then okay.
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Sorry, I have to get this.
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Grace, what's wrong?
You were pregnant before you got married?
And I was an accident?
Nothing beats Bali.
The water is so clear.
Like glass.
And the men...
so advanced, sexually.
It's a Hindu culture.
You didn't want a second child.
We very much wanted a second child.
Where's your grandma?
Is she there?
Grace, where are you?
Grandma,
Mom wants to talk to you.
God.
Look, we went out to the cars,
but they were blocked by...
Mom, I need you to do something for me.
Look, Alicia, I didn't expect to take care of the kids tonight.
I know. That's why I'm asking nicely.
It's a little before 9:00,
and I need you to walk four blocks,
to the Astor Street Mansion.
The Astor Street Mansion?
Yes. That's where the party's at. I'm going there now,
and I will meet you there.
You're not angry?
I will meet you there in 15 minutes.
Got it.
Detective Young!
How are you this fine evening?
You're not getting a look at the shooter's car, Kalinda.
Come on, Doug. Let me take a look.
We're working here.
Yeah? Checking for connections to Nozowitz?
Kalinda, you know there's no connection.
You're protecting your detective.
No. You defense attorneys think he's wearing a badge,
he must be guilty.
But Nozowitz was working undercover
for the D.E.A. at the time.
He's innocent, Kalinda.
What year Lincoln is it, Doug?
2006. Zephyr. Now leave us alone.
You know the odd thing about the 2006 Zephyr?
I have no idea.
It doesn't have GPS.
I am so sorry. I had no idea.
So who knew?
Whose idea was it to lie about Alicia being a target?
Whoa, whoa. Where you going?
Back.
Look, we needed to catch a killer.
Of course I'd do whatever I could to get information from you.
Yep. Everyone's doing their job.
And all I can tell you is go...
...yourself.
I'm so sorry, Mike. I-I heard.
How are you doing?
Not great. Look at this.
Look at this. Do you believe this?
Oh, you'll be fine.
It-it... it happens to the best of us.
What happens to the best of us?
A little tipple. A little spill.
It's Saint Patrick's Day.
It's forgivable.
Your Eminence, Peter Florrick hit me.
What? No.
He wants you to think that I was drinking and fell down,
but it was his drink! He put it there!
He wanted it to look like mine.
No, I know, I know.
You take care now, Mike.
Mrs. Florrick. Alicia.
Hello. You're the one person I haven't spent a second with.
Your Eminence.
Ah, the formal greeting.
Well, I had to look it up online.
So, either your son has been arrested for smoking marijuana
or the police needed your help with a murder.
The latter. Uh, I don't know who told you about the former
but definitely the latter.
Yes, that's what your mother said.
My... my mother?
Yes, Veronica.
She was here, somewhere.
Just to be clear, Your Eminence,
she likes saying things for their shock value.
Oh, I know.
It was so nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
What was that? What did he say?
Nothing. Everything's good.
Peter hit Kresteva.
What?
Peter hit Kresteva,
but everybody thinks he fell down, so play along.
Peter fell down?
No, no, Kresteva fell down.
From drinking. He has a bloody nose.
Are you serious?
Did you see it?
The punch? No.
But I heard it was epic.
Make yourself comfortable.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look.
Nozowitz is a tough cop but an honest one,
and this crap about him being tied to the killing...
Shut up.
You convinced me.
I...
What? How'd I do that?
Our client sued a lot of people.
He made a lot of people angry.
Okay.
See there? That object?
Yeah. What is it?
You ever heard of Fetch-Far?
It's something that dog owners use to fling tennis balls
so their dogs can chase it.
Okay.
Well, one of the people our client sued was a dog lover.
His dog was barking a lot.
Are you kidding? You-you think this is about a dog barking?
Have you ever met a dog lover?
Mom.
Grace.
Where's Grandma?
I don't know.
She was talking with some guy.
I was pregnant... when we got married.
And we were embar...
No. I was embarrassed,
so I changed the date of our wedding.
And me?
You were not an accident.
We wanted you.
Because... you thought I'd keep you together?
No, Grace.
But we're the reason why you're...
not with who you want to be.
I don't want to be the reason that you had to be responsible.
Grace, listen to me.
This isn't about responsibility.
This is about... love.
I loved you before you were born.
And I loved Zach before he was born.
And I love you even more now.
And Dad?
I love him.
Peter.
Your Eminence.
Oh. There you are.
Hi, Mom.
Zach and I were looking all over for you.
How'd it go?
Good. I'm going to talk to your grandmother for a minute.
I'll be right back.
No uh-oh. I just want to talk.
See you later kids.
Mom.
No. No, no, no. It's not what you think.
We had an adventure.
I mean, they are such great kids.
They're so funny. They made me laugh.
Though I do think you might be protecting them too much.
That's up to me.
No one is saying it isn't.
At least you can let me give you just a modicum of advice.
They need to be treated the way I treated you.
I know you don't want me to see them, but I have to see them.
And whatever you say, whatever you do,
I'm gonna see them.
Even if I have to sneak into their schools,
I'm gonna see them.
Mom.
Maybe I'm getting senile...
but I like them.
They remind me of your father.
I know.
Okay, I was going to rip into you, Mom, but...
we're talking tomorrow because...
you can't use the truth to undercut me with my kids.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Good.
There you are.
Oh, I had to step away.
Peter.
Hi, Veronica.
Would you like to dance?
I would.
You know, this is just like our wedding.
So, no cardinal's hug?
No.
I'm so sorry.
Look, if life is about getting a hug,
then I'm in the wrong business.
Thank you, by the way.
For what?
Punching Kresteva.
Oh. No, I-I... I couldn't have punched Kresteva.
It wouldn't make sense for me to punch Kresteva,
so I must not have.
He shook Kresteva's hand, too.
What?
He didn't make a choice.
He didn't hug either of you.
First time ever. We are in...
uncharted territory here.
Oh. Well, good. Good.
Well, you're both taking this very casually.
Eli, I'm dancing with my wife now.
Okay, I'll go worry about the campaign;
you... dance.
Why not settle?
Why are you making so many enemies?
This is for you.
What is it?
Bach. I thought you'd enjoy it at home.
Thanks.
Let's settle.
Okay, Matthew?
It's just a dog barking.
You don't need the money.
I've never needed the money.
It was always about the process.
What process?
Being with you.
Matthew...
That was a joke.
Are you sure?
Yeah,
I'm sure.
Suing because I liked being with you...
wouldn't make sense.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Are you all right?
Just a memory.
Of what?
Nothing.
