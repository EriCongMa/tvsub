gossip girl here ...
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i can &apos;t have you spending time
with someone mixed up with drugs .
everyone will be happy to know that damien and i broke up .
you touch this dress , you will never set foot in here again .
you should do your own clothing line .
i can model them . you can totally do this .
i had no idea you &apos;d be such a little thief .
agnes , give me my dresses ! what are you doing ? !
keeping these feelings aside is--is killing me ,
&apos;cause all i wanna do is tell everybody how happy i am .
i think you should tell people .
i want to be as much a part of your life as you &apos;ll let me .
i need someone to take over operations of my hotel .
there are other people who &apos;d do a better job .
those other people aren &apos;t my mother .
do we have ourselves a hotel ?
we do .
they say the clothes make the man ,
but who makes the clothes ?
on the upper east side , it &apos;s eleanor waldorf ,
and we hear her new line is to die for .
so , uh , where are we going ?
i thought everyone was coming over for brunch .
it &apos;s the first since you moved back to lily &apos;s .
jen , as hard as it is for me to admit ,
there are some things more important in life than waffles .
and i &apos;m not gonna let you spend another day sulking in that apartment .
okay , well , you grounded me .
and i won &apos;t be able to unground you
until i know you &apos;re okay .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to eleanor &apos;s .
wait . what ?
i was talking to serena , and she said
that eleanor is having something called a pop @-@ up fashion show
for her new junior line .
so i called eleanor
and asked her if you could help out .
dad , the last time i worked for eleanor ,
it didn &apos;t exactly end well . remember ?
but i also remember that my daughter used to love working in fashion .
listen , just give it a shot . your room &apos;s not going anywhere .
this isn &apos;t so bad , is it ?
thanks , dad .
i &apos;ll see you at home tonight , after the show .
there &apos;s something about waking up on the day of a fashion show .
the smell of fresh pleats wafting through the city ...
nothing quickens your blood quite like couture .
ride with me uptown ?
my mother would love to see you for breakfast .
i have a breakfast with my mother .
i &apos;m so proud of you for opening up to elizabeth .
she earned my trust , and i , hers .
and she seems to be
faring well at the helm of the mighty empire ?
oh , she &apos;s a natural .
have a perfect day .
oh . nothing says luxury quite like your own private army .
victor , is everything all right ?
mr. bass , you need to vacate the premises ... immediately .
i think you &apos;ve misunderstood .
i may have put my mother in charge for the time being ,
but i &apos;m not leaving the hotel .
actually , sir , these orders come from her .
my , look who &apos;s risen from the dead .
i just wanted to say thank you so much for this opportunity .
and i &apos;ve really learned a lot
since the last time we worked together ,
and i won &apos;t let you down .
well , despite our troubled past , as i told your father ,
i am a firm believer in second chances ,
so i even rehired your friend .
jenny .
agnes .
uh , hi . how are you ?
uh , 90 days sober in a.a.
good for you . now come on , jenny .
what are you waiting for ? get agnes fitted , hmm ?
i like to see my elves busy .
clock &apos;s tickin &apos; .
you ready ?
&apos;cause this is it .
mm . i &apos;m ready .
it &apos;s time .
we &apos;re just gonna go in and tell them we &apos;re dating .
exactly . it &apos;s--it &apos;s no big .
hey ! it &apos;s the lovebirds .
hey , you two .
he told you , didn &apos;t he ?
she can read my mind . i mean ...
oh , come on . you couldn &apos;t wait to tell .
well , speaking for everyone else , i think it &apos;s great .
and now that the happy couple has arrived , let &apos;s go eat .
come on .
i have some very exciting news .
mr. conwell is flying in from salt lake city
to see the show tonight .
mr. conwell ?
he is the c.e.o. of conwell &apos;s department stores .
blair , it &apos;s the biggest retailer in the entire country ,
and my first choice to carry the new junior line .
what about barneys or saks ...
or bloomingdale &apos;s ?
hmm . no , my dear , high @-@ end has fallen on hard times .
mr. conwell can put my line
in over 5,000 retail locations .
where bristol palin shops ?
feed the masses . eat with the classes .
although you do raise a very good point .
my usual crowd of uptown socialites
and boho fashionistas
might give mr. conwell the wrong message .
we need to surround him
with wholesome american girls--
the kind of girl that he wants to shop at conwell &apos;s .
i just had the most inspired idea .
dessert at momofuku after the show ?
no . you should invite all of your college girlfriends
to see the show tonight .
mother , it &apos;s very last minute .
miss blair keep girls on busy schedule .
must beat drum , she says .
baby beat dorota &apos;s stomach like lars from metallica .
no . i need get a go of pink shit college freshmen
just bring 10 or 20 , no more than 30 .
tell them how important it is to you , to me .
i need mr. conwell to say yes .
but , miss blair , you have no friends .
even n.y.u. minions very second @-@ rate .
actually ...
there is one person at n.y.u. who could help .
chuck .
did you send security to kick me out ?
just listen . i ...
no .
let me .
morning , nephew .
what is this leech doing stuck to my hotel ?
your hotel ?
this is elizabeth &apos;s hotel .
you &apos;re just a guest who &apos;s no longer welcome here .
i &apos;m sorry , chuck . you need to leave .
what ?
wait . what the hell is going on here ?
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
you &apos;ve been played , chucky , from the very beginning .
now ...
it &apos;s check @-@ out time ,
and we need to get your room ready
for , well , me .
stop .
we hear chuck &apos;s hotel is hanging on by a thread ...
and jack &apos;s pulling all the strings .
vanessa , i &apos;m seriously so happy for you guys .
thanks . it &apos;s been really great .
it &apos;s been so easy to be with dan , you know ,
knowing someone your whole life , like you and nate .
yeah , it definitely has its advantages .
when you &apos;ve known someone so long ,
you know , you &apos;re just more comfortable .
nate and i have no problem trying new things .
not like that .
just keeping the romance and mystery alive .
you don &apos;t ever want to fall into a rut .
i &apos;m sure you and dan ...
yeah , we always try new things .
so since you guys are out of hiding ,
what are your plans tonight ?
you should come to eleanor &apos;s fashion show .
oh , no . actually , uh , we &apos;re--
we &apos;re just gonna be doing dinner at the loft .
vanessa &apos;s cooking up some ,
private dinner , hmm ? sounds romantic .
no , no . it &apos;s not--it &apos;s not like that . it &apos;s not like that .
we &apos;re just , you know , watching movies , cooking up some noodles .
uh , it &apos;s kind of become our saturday tradition .
agnes , can you put your arms down , please ?
both arms .
look , agnes , i &apos;m sorry for how everything went down .
i shouldn &apos;t have gone behind your back
and tried to cut you out of the fashion line .
i was gonna quit anyway . those dresses were lame .
agnes , i &apos;m trying to apologize .
you trusted me , believed in me , and i betrayed you .
i was wrong . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry for torching your dresses .
truth is , they were amazing .
over it ?
i missed you , bitch .
what is it ?
nothing .
ugh . well ...
truth is i was dating this guy named damien ,
and he was a lot of things , one of them being a dealer .
the sid to your nancy .
that &apos;s awesome . what happened ?
well , when i didn &apos;t want to , uh ...
whatever with him , he bailed .
now he just keeps texting me for his stupid pills .
sweetie , you can &apos;t let him treat you like that .
i know , but whatever . spin .
hey , damien ?
it &apos;s jenny &apos;s friend agnes .
what are you doing ?
yeah , she wanted me to call you to set up a swap .
we were thinking the waldorf pop @-@ up show ?
love it . kiss .
agnes .
what ? chill out . this is your payback , okay ?
he &apos;s gonna show up tonight . you &apos;re gonna wave the baggy
in front of his face and then flush it down the toilet .
no one gets hurt , and you get to show him who &apos;s boss .
gotta take back your pride , babe .
all right . i &apos;ll admit that &apos;s actually kind of brilliant .
we &apos;re total bitches .
hey .
i want to do something special for dan tonight .
vanessa , i &apos;m sorry . i hope i didn &apos;t make you feel--
no , not at all . you were right . noodles and movies ?
i mean , i just don &apos;t want it to feel like
his one @-@ millionth dinner with the same girl
he &apos;s known his whole life .
two words ... role @-@ play .
you know , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s not a terrible idea .
why don &apos;t you do a date night
inspired by one of his favorite films ?
he would definitely not be expecting that .
hey , so , uh , i &apos;ll see you at the loft at 6 : 00 ?
6 : 30 maybe .
okay .
oh , my god .
what &apos;s wrong ?
we , uh , we have to find chuck .
you hate it ?
i had forgotten how talented you are .
i want to close with this .
and after the show is over ,
you and i need to have a talk about finding you
a more permanent position with waldorf designs .
yeah . wow . eleanor , thank you so much .
treats were in your dresser , just like you said .
grabbed this clutch to hide &apos; em .
ohh ! the eagle has landed .
thank you , kali .
i &apos;m sorry , agnes ...
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t think i wanna go through with this .
it &apos;s just that it &apos;s the first time in weeks
that i &apos;ve been able to not think about damien
and the first time in even longer that i &apos;ve actually been happy .
i don &apos;t know i just really forgot how much i love this ,
and i don &apos;t want to do anything to mess it up , you know ?
i &apos;ll just text damien and , uh ,
tell him to forget it , okay ?
it &apos;s okay . i get it .
i was just trying to help out an old friend .
chuck ?
are you okay ?
hey . what &apos;s going on ?
it would appear we &apos;ve all been players in a jack bass plot .
the reappearance of my mother , the lawsuit ...
it &apos;s all been part of an elaborate ruse
to get me to sign over my hotel to elizabeth .
you have to admire his handiwork .
have you spoken to your lawyers ? there &apos;s gotta be a way .
it turns out my lawyer was in on it .
regardless , a suit to regain control would take months ,
in which time jack would have bankrupted the hotel ,
making it easy pickings for whatever vultures he has lined up .
my only hope is to talk to elizabeth alone ,
convince her to sign the hotel back over to me .
what makes you think she &apos;s gonna do that ?
this isn &apos;t her idea . jack has something on her .
i just need to figure out what . i &apos;ll call you .
and all this time , we thought
chuck got his dark side from his father .
maybe his mother &apos;s the one that &apos;s evil .
if she is his mother .
the story elizabeth told me ...
how do we even know it &apos;s true ?
chuck did a d.n.a. test . it was his guy at the n.y.p.d.
yeah , i know , but he probably sent it out to a lab .
i mean , i wouldn &apos;t put it past jack bass to fake it .
well , whatever the truth is , chuck isn &apos;t ready to hear it .
in the meantime , i have to get ready for a fashion show .
it &apos;s in 2 hours , and i have 30 friends coming .
what ? what friends ?
excuse me . miss brandeis ?
can i help you ?
i &apos;m dorota .
uh , miss blair would like to know , uh ,
what is your hourly
and if you have any friends , like , 30 ?
30 ?
hey , jenny , can you help me get these racks downstairs ?
yes .
oh , don &apos;t worry . i can watch your stuff .
thanks . okay .
careful , j. the show &apos;s about to start ,
and it looks like eleanor &apos;s line
is going to bring a whole new meaning to high fashion .
like taking candy from a baby .
helen , thank you so much for coming .
storey , you look adorable .
b. , i know what chuck said , but shouldn &apos;t we ...
do nothing .
he says he wants to handle it on his own . we let him .
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s killing me ?
oh , my god . brandeis is here .
finally .
serena .
brandeis .
how &apos;s congressman wade ?
he &apos;s polling very well these days .
okay , so there &apos;s your target ...
the guy over there talking to my mom ... ed conwell .
and remember , you guys are my
b.f.f.s from n.y.u. , so ...
we got it , blair .
we &apos;re closed for businessmen .
what ?
my mother said she wanted me
to pack the crowd with wholesome american girls .
so you hired escorts ?
b. , you couldn &apos;t just
tell your mom you don &apos;t have friends at n.y.u. ?
prostitutes are people , too ,
and they have a lot of disposable income .
who are you ?
good evening , daniel .
hungry ?
hey , this is , um , this is just like ...
&quot; rear window . &quot; i know .
come on , people .
trish , the girls look great . are they ready ?
show &apos;s in five minutes .
agnes , where did you get that ?
what ? it &apos;s not like you &apos;re gonna do anything with it .
it &apos;s just a little party .
what about your 90 days ?
look , i need the waldorfs of the world
to think that i &apos;m working a program so i can get hired .
okay , well , i &apos;m not gonna let you risk ruining
risk ruining the entire show .
what are you gonna do ?
waltz up to eleanor and tell her
that your drug dealer dumped your virgin ass
and now the rest of her models are high on his stash ?
i will tell eleanor exactly what happened .
you know , this is my second chance .
and you might not want to change your life ,
but i certainly want to change mine .
oh , eleanor , i need to tell you something .
no . no , not now , jenny .
the show-- it &apos;s--it &apos;s about to start .
come on . get the girls in line .
but , eleanor , i--
my goodness , getting models to do anything ,
it &apos;s like herding cats . yes ?
yes , but i really--
jenny , go .
you know , i think
it &apos;s time for little j. to say good night .
i thought you wanted to wait till the after party .
no . let &apos;s put her to bed early .
i thought i was being taken to the empire .
elias and a few other employees are still loyal .
i don &apos;t know how much my uncle has promised you ,
but i &apos;ll double it if you give me my hotel back .
oh , chuck , this was never about money .
then what does jack have on you ?
&apos;cause it must be something for you to do all this .
i love him .
i know it &apos;s very difficult for you to understand--
jack isn &apos;t capable of love . he is using you .
he is stealing my hotel and then he will leave you .
i know he &apos;s not perfect ,
but he understands me .
he doesn &apos;t judge me .
underneath it all , he &apos;s a kind , loving person .
what kind of loving person
would convince you to do this to me ?
when we started the game , i told myself ...
that you were just a stranger .
but i didn &apos;t know how much i &apos;d come to care for you .
so help me .
give me back my hotel .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re sorry ? that &apos;s it ?
i need jack .
and i believe he needs me , too .
he--he loves me .
if you believe that ...
then you deserve whatever happens next .
wow . i didn &apos;t realize blair had so many friends at n.y.u.
yeah . though at $ 300 an hour , they don &apos;t come cheap .
oh , it &apos;s chuck . hey .
i couldn &apos;t get through to elizabeth .
well , what happened ?
she thinks she loves jack . it &apos;s over .
the empire &apos;s gone .
i don &apos;t know . um , what do you say , brandeis ?
about five minutes ?
uh , yeah .
five minutes .
maybe not . hey ,
can you get jack to eleanor &apos;s fashion show ?
so ?
uh , it was great . it was great .
i &apos;m not really a shellfish kind of guy .
the little middle green parts kinda , you know ,
but the wine-- the wine was amazing .
montrachet , just like ...
what grace kelly brought jimmy stewart .
that &apos;s right , yeah .
but a part of you
wishes we &apos;d had ramen .
no . no . what ? no . no , no .
seriously , vanessa , this was-- this was amazing .
in fact , i got you a little surprise .
the student union is running a mizoguchi marathon tonight .
that sounds amazing , but i thought we &apos;d do
something different tonight , break out of our rut .
our rut ? we ... we just started dating .
what do we do now that we didn &apos;t do when we were friends ?
are you--are you serious ?
obviously , besides that .
all right , is this what that whole &quot; good evening , daniel &quot;
bit over there was all about ?
i was just trying to put a little mystery in our relationship ...
but if you &apos;d rather just do the same old thing ,
then ...
hey ! oh , no . i &apos;m sorry .
i was just gonna pick up my 12 @-@ string .
no , why don &apos;t you stay ? i made dessert .
no . this is clearly a date .
you don &apos;t want it to be like every other night three of us hangout .
really ? because that sounds exactly like what dan wants .
what &apos;s going on ?
i @-@ i &apos;m not sure .
don &apos;t you just love the line ?
everybody looks good in it ,
even the people who shop in your store .
the clothes speak for themselves ,
but , unfortunately , our stores will never carry
your mother &apos;s line if this is the type of clientele
that will be attracted to conwell &apos;s .
what ? it attracts all kinds . everyone is here .
yeah , i can see that .
apparently ...
even prostitutes .
hey , jenny .
eleanor wanted to congratulate you on a great show
and say thanks for all your hard work .
aw , thank you .
last year she congratulated me herself with a toast .
well , you deserve it .
we hear eleanor &apos;s show brought down the house .
did you give her one or two ?
three .
sounds like a night to remember ...
if you can .
aw , what &apos;s the matter , j. ?
champagne go to your head ?
did you put something in my drink ?
you know , ever since i saw you at eleanor &apos;s ,
all i could think about was payback for last year .
then damien &apos;s party favors just happened to fall into my lap .
what , did you think i was gonna stand around all day
and watch eleanor kiss your ass ?
you know , i was gonna have my own fashion line .
things were gonna change for me .
and then you had to go ahead and do it all your way .
so here &apos;s to you , j. cheers .
nate , i heard my nephew &apos;s ready to cry uncle .
where is he ?
you can wait by the bar .
now we just need jack to be jack .
vanessa , this is fantastic .
i didn &apos;t realize you made flan .
i got the recipe off the internet .
oh . did you do something to your hair ?
excuse me .
son , i have to tell you ,
this date is a disaster . what &apos;s going on ?
she has this idea that we &apos;re stuck in a rut ,
and she &apos;s trying to break us out of it .
a rut ? you just started dating .
yeah . i @-@ i @-@ i know .
look , the two of you just need to talk this through .
she &apos;s vanessa . you &apos;re dan . you guys are best friends .
did she just leave ?
mm @-@ hmm .
you whore and a half .
you couldn &apos;t just keep it in your pants ?
conwell was about to buy my mother &apos;s junior line until you--
blair , i didn &apos;t cruise mr. conwell .
then how does he know ... you &apos;re a prostitute ?
he doesn &apos;t . he knows julian is .
he &apos;s supposed to see him tonight , in fact .
julian and conwell party every time he flies into town .
i &apos;m really sorry , blair .
we had no idea there &apos;d be clients here tonight .
it was a total surprise .
i bet it was .
brandeis , my apologies .
i &apos;ll be right back .
mr. conwell , a moment !
your special friend , julian ,
wanted you to know that he &apos;s running a little late tonight .
blair , i @-@ i have a family .
so do i , mr. conwell .
and when you love your family , like we both do ,
you never want to see them get hurt or disappointed .
what &apos;s that ?
you want to take another look at my mother &apos;s line ?
of course you can .
so we photograph jack with a couple of hookers
and then show it to elizabeth ?
yes , and then she signs the empire back to chuck .
okay .
you &apos;ve only got one shot .
evening .
serena . nate .
this is jessica and bethany .
were you hoping to catch me in a compromising position ?
a little high school , don &apos;t you think ?
leave the plotting to the experts .
bethany , what were you saying about sustainable energy ?
i &apos;m gonna call chuck .
i &apos;ll find blair .
wait ! wait . this little one &apos;s not going home just yet ,
we &apos;re gonna go see if we can get this girl laid .
pile in , bitches .
spotted--little j. passing out in a taxi .
jenny ?
jenny !
uh @-@ oh . looks like somebody better call the fashion police .
is this where the bachelor party is ?
yeah . you here to join us ?
me ? no .
but , uh , my friend here-- she &apos;s ready to party .
make sure you guys show her a good time .
thank you , amy .
this is my first review for &quot; teen vogue . &quot;
i &apos;m very excited .
mother !
bye , eleanor .
what ?
great news .
eleanor .
mr. conwell .
i just wanted to tell you that conwell &apos;s would be honored
to call itself your exclusive retailer .
that is marvelous news , isn &apos;t it , blair ?
congratulations .
yes .
of course we need to make a few alterations--
uh , hemlines , necklines . you understand .
we could certainly discuss it . is that all ?
and we &apos;d like to change the name .
&quot; eleanor waldorf &quot; sounds a bit uppity and new york @-@ ish .
excuse me .
for the last 28 years , every piece of clothing i have sewn
has carried the name &quot; eleanor waldorf . &quot;
my clothes are me .
my store is me .
manhattan is an island in more ways than one .
what works for you and yours
doesn &apos;t necessarily translate to me and mine .
mr. conwell , i think you &apos;re forgetting about something or someone .
blair .
i want to thank you for your time ,
but i do not think i will be doing business with conwell &apos;s .
enjoy your flight back to salt lake .
mother , what are you doing ? we could close this .
no . it was a stupid idea to begin with .
i don &apos;t know what i was thinking .
i would rather lose the deal than lose myself .
never hide who you are-- you remember that , hmm ?
everyone at n.y.u. hates me .
what ?
i have minions , of course , but ...
they &apos;re hardly even worthy of the name .
no , i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
what about all your friends from school ?
they &apos;ll be anyone &apos;s friend ... for the night .
i was scared to tell you about n.y.u.
because i didn &apos;t want you to be disappointed in me .
i did everything to try and fit in ,
but i hate it there .
my girl .
one of the things that make waldorf women so special
is that we don &apos;t fit in everywhere .
but i don &apos;t feel like i fit in anywhere .
that &apos;s &apos; cause you haven &apos;t found the right place yet .
you will .
all right , one more round and we &apos;re out of here .
maybe i should stay and , uh , take care of blondie .
no . no .
we &apos;ll tell the bartender to call her a cab .
all right , first , shots !
hello ?
hey . where are you ? i &apos;ve been calling you for--
nate ?
um , i don &apos;t know where i am .
i feel sick .
okay , jenny , hold on one second .
listen , just stay put .
all right , i &apos;m coming to get you .
hurry , please .
can we talk ?
look , what happened tonight ?
don &apos;t you worry that we do all the same stuff we did
when we were best friends ? we go to movies ,
we play scrabble with rufus ,
we go to coffee shops and make fun of people .
we are the exact same .
yeah , well , except--
yes , i know . we have sex .
but i just wanted to do something to say ,
hello , we &apos;re more than friends with benefits .
no , i was going to say except , uh , it &apos;s not the same .
and if you give me a chance , i want to take you
on the most romantic second first date you &apos;ve ever had .
where ?
well , that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s a surprise .
i hope you didn &apos;t bring me here
to gloat over your boyfriend &apos;s loyalty .
chuck , i called you because ...
this afternoon , i didn &apos;t have the courage to tell you
that i ... i signed the hotel over to jack .
seeing you made me realize what i &apos;d done ,
and--and so then i told him he had to make a choice--
me or the hotel .
and what did my uncle say ?
my flight to zurich leaves at 10 : 00 .
i wanted to say good @-@ bye .
i &apos;m sorry .
i tried .
stay ...
not for jack or the hotel .
stay for me .
i already lost my mother once .
chuck ...
i &apos;m ...
not your mother .
i don &apos;t know if your real mother is alive or not ,
but i &apos;m sure she loved you very much
and that she &apos;s nothing like me .
you &apos;re right .
because my real mother
could never have done to me what you did .
andy better be calling that chick a cab , man .
that girl looked about 12 .
hey . where is she ?
want to get out of here ? i live real close . come on .
where &apos;s nate ?
is nate your boyfriend ?
no .
cause he really shouldn &apos;t have left you . ooh .
no , i don &apos;t ...
jenny .
who the hell are you ?
get off her .
i was helping her .
yeah , sure you were .
it seems chivalry isn &apos;t dead after all .
lucky for this damsel in a dress ,
some things never go out of fashion .
how you feeling ?
steadier . how do i look ?
i don &apos;t want to worry my dad .
yeah , just , um , play the exhausted card , okay ?
hey . how was the show ?
i thought you &apos;d be back a little sooner .
yeah . sorry i &apos;m late . the show was great , though .
yeah , there were no cabs ,
so i just figured i &apos;d walk her back .
yeah . i &apos;m so tired . um , i &apos;m just gonna crash .
but thank you so much , dad . i love you .
thanks for seeing her home .
good night .
so i finally told my mom about n.y.u ..
b. , i &apos;m very proud of you
for telling your mother the truth .
why ? what good does the truth ever do ?
my mother can &apos;t help me make friends .
excuse me . aren &apos;t you blair waldorf ?
yes .
sorry to bother you .
but we &apos;re freshmen at columbia and , well ...
we thought you were dead .
we haven &apos;t read about you on &quot; gossip girl &quot; in forever .
what ? you read &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
of course . everyone at columbia does .
i @-@ i love your louboutins .
but ...
the bow goes on the right .
oh . thank you . bye .
s. , what do you know about columbia ?
hey , you forgot your purse .
you okay ?
what &apos;s wrong with me ?
nothing is wrong with you .
what are you talking about ?
like , how did i end up here ?
jenny , look at me .
okay , things ...
haven &apos;t exactly been so easy for me either .
now ...
i &apos;m with serena , and i &apos;m so happy .
things will turn around for you , too .
yeah .
what if you &apos;re wrong , nate ?
what if everything we just--
it &apos;s eleanor .
&quot; great job today . you &apos;re hired .
lunch tomorrow . &quot;
okay . oh , my god .
see ?
and i @-@ i hope you learn from this , okay ,
mostly that i &apos;m always right .
yeah . okay .
oh , god , nate , thank you so much for tonight .
yeah . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
here . try the bryndza . come on , swap .
the , uh , the cabbage is my second favorite .
so this was your big romantic date ,
having pierogies delivered to my dorm room ?
tell me you &apos;re not having fun .
no , i am ,
but this isn &apos;t a date . this is what we always do .
i know , yeah , except now we get to do this .
and that &apos;s called being friends with benefits .
no . no , because for me ,
the benefit is that even though we &apos;re--
we &apos;re doing the same things that we used to do--eating pierogies
and going to see &quot; ugetsu &quot; for the sixth time--
we &apos;ve only seen it four times .
well , right now-- now ...
i get to do them with you as my girlfriend ,
which is why just sitting here with you
is the most romantic date i can imagine .
humphrey , you just earned yourself some extra benefits .
if you are what you wear ,
you better dress the part you want .
a few lucky ladies can do no wrong .
their look &apos;s perfection ,
and they &apos;ve got accessories to match .
but most girls get tired of the same old look ,
and they &apos;ll do just about anything
to get the hot new piece on their arm .
and then there are those with no vision of their own--
thieves of fashion who &apos;ll steal the shirt off your back .
did you change your mind ?
mm , i was hoping you changed yours .
perhaps you need to see the view from up here .
people really do look like ants .
how did i ever love you ?
fair question .
but if love won &apos;t tempt you , how about money ?
i &apos;m leaving ,
and i don &apos;t want anything .
where are you gonna go ?
you destroyed your relationship with your son .
who else do you have besides me ?
i told chuck i wasn &apos;t his mother
and that he deserves someone better than me .
i &apos;ll warn you--
you &apos;re taking off just when it &apos;s about to get fun .
i &apos;m starting over .
i &apos;m going to try to be the person i forgot .
and always remember , appearances can be deceiving .
let &apos;s go .
chuck . are you okay ?
what happened ?
elizabeth ?
is dead to me .
she &apos;s gone .
and the hotel ?
oh , lost .
oh , chuck ...
what ?
sorry ?
don &apos;t be .
i &apos;m not .
i &apos;ve come this far without my mother .
i &apos;m not backing down now .
if it &apos;s a war jack wants , then it &apos;s a war he &apos;ll get .
but whatever you wear , always dress to kill .
