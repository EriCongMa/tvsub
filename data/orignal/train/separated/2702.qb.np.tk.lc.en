carmela &apos;s ma returned these to the kids filled with memories .
you can &apos;t write stuff for my kids ?
that &apos;s nobody &apos;s business .
too busy feeling sorry for yourself .
she &apos;ll do it .
it &apos;s good for her . she knows that . keep her mind active .
why do anything if there &apos;s nothing in it for her ?
listen up .
concentrate . i know it &apos;s difficult .
remember the plane tickets ?
they were stolen .
did you say that , or did the feds ? what did you tell them ?
what did i do ?
they &apos;re trying to build a rico case against me .
what will you say on the witness stand ?
they only let you go to get your cooperation .
don &apos;t wave your hanky at me . what will you say from now on ?
i never stated those tickets were stolen .
barb &apos;ll testify . you back her up .
i should have kept my mouth shut , like a mute .
in the future , any deal they make ...
... you keep your mouth shut .
for a year i didn &apos;t speak to you . maybe i should have kept it that way .
fuck it . do what you want .
did you say something to noah ?
if you &apos;re smart , keep walking .

ma don &apos; t go to nightclubs .
how do you know ? i used to dance .
money &apos;s nothing to me .
i guess not .
but with no heart and no brains , it &apos;s all you &apos;ve got .
tommy ! tommy !
his mother died last night .
no shit ?
ton , i &apos;m so sorry to hear .
what &apos;re you gonna do ?
i know how you feel .
we lost mom last year .
you remember .
least she didn &apos;t suffer .
ralphie , i need to talk to you .
albert , you too .
vito , have a sfogliatella .
carmela , she &apos;s gone .
come on .
who torched one of albert &apos;s trucks ?
one of the trucks ?
be quiet .
he lit up two of my dumpsters .
what &apos;s the matter with you ? we &apos;re in the newspapers every week .
my crew is in line for the raritan township contract .
they keep whispering to albert !
what did you say ? whose crew ?
you put anyone you want over the crew .
you &apos;re a captain when i say you are .
i &apos;ll turn up my hearing aid .
getting cute with me ? with my mother dead ?
raritan township recycling manager , joe zachary .
i &apos;m in line for the contract , but he &apos;s talking to albert .
he &apos;s threatening to go to the epa .
he said that ?
all right , fix it .
no more fires .
i &apos;m ditching spanish . meet me by the trophy case .
how could we possibly get busted ?
the boys &apos; room by the stage ? they never check it .
mr. soprano , janice , barb . please accept my condolences .
i &apos;ll use all my skills .
don &apos;t go crazy . i mean , you know ?
then we &apos;re not envisioning any visitation hours for mom ?
she didn &apos;t want any service .
i find that hard to accept .
is she still down at the hospital morgue ?
we brought mom here this morning . she &apos;s downstairs .
there &apos;s gonna be a priest , right ?
yeah , sure . a priest , i guess .
when would that be ?
you &apos;re not having a mass ? i &apos;m not selling here .
she was catholic but not religious .
i thought we &apos;d have a shindig at the house .
after . so the grandkids could , you know ...
i don &apos;t know .
i know what mom &apos;s wishes were , but not to have a wake ?
we look like unloving children , and cheapskates .
who gives a shit ? it &apos;s her wishes .
i wish to honor her .
there &apos;s a lot of things i could say that i won &apos;t !
you think we should do something now ?
she used to picture her funeral .
you wanna do something , let &apos;s just do it .
cozzerelli , arrange it all . send me the bill .
tony , this all won &apos;t fall on you .
i &apos;ll paint the overleaf for the program .
motifs from the mexican day of the dead .
one thing that i &apos;d like to suggest :
everyone gathers and can voice a remembrance or a feeling about mom .
i don &apos;t want any california bullshit .
people can drink , they can eat .
if they wanna yak about ma , they can .
no &quot; i &apos;m sorry , my condolences . &quot; nothing .
actually , that &apos;s good .
it &apos;s a relief , you not saying nothing , to tell the truth .
you know , everybody else , all bullshit .
all right , here &apos;s the thing . i &apos;m glad she &apos;s dead .
not just glad . i wished she &apos;d die . wished .
had this court case coming up . she might &apos;ve testified against me .
so when i heard she was dead , relief flooded into my veins .
how do you feel about your mother testifying against you ?
come on , will you listen to yourself ?
is that right , wishing her dead ?
is that being a good son ?
good son ?
yeah , a good son . i mean , bad sons ...
bad sons what ?
they should fucking die .
that &apos;s a fucking disgusting thing to be .
your kid , at bard . he better be a good son , right ?
you &apos;re right . why should i be good to that old bat ?
that fucking selfish , miserable cunt ?
she ruined my father &apos;s life . oh , yeah .
but he wasn &apos;t her son . what did she do to you ?
that &apos;s a matter of public record . we both know .
you can &apos;t say it .
she didn &apos;t know what she was doing .
you &apos;re letting her off .
my uncle denies it .
he loves you .
i know that !
grown children often wish for an aged parent to die .
it &apos;s not necessary for the parent to testify against them .
it &apos;s a taboo thought , but common .
particularly if the parent has lost all capacity for joy at being alive .
so we &apos;re probably done here , right ?
she &apos;s dead .
what is it ?
tony &apos;s mother &apos;s wake is tonight .
want me to wear a wire ?
sure . need batteries ? let &apos;s go to office depot .
janice ?
i &apos;m downstairs .
hi .
hey .
mom would want a closed casket .
definitely .
they usually put a picture on the casket . what do you think ?
look at that .
she &apos;s smiling .
she looks normal .
it was us kids who turned her .
one of us .
get the fuck off !
all right , all right !
maybe you &apos;re right .
my shrink says all women aren &apos;t cut out to be mothers .
is that a slam at me ?
no .
if my father was in the circus , maybe i &apos;d turn out like harp ...
hal .
this is weird .
what ?
none of my childhood artwork is here anymore .
nor barb &apos;s .
get the fuck out of here .
&quot; anthony soprano , 7th grade , mr. martino . &quot; i had him .
&quot; why fear strikes out by jim piersall is a good book . &quot;
take a look . she only saved yours .
what ? here &apos;s barbara &apos;s communion certificate .
here &apos;s her baby shoe .
yeah . that &apos;s it .
nothing of mine .
everybody agreed i had &quot; extraordinary visualization skills . &quot;
those pencil drawings that i did of grandpa ?
good .
tony . sorry .
tony , i &apos;m sorry .
he &apos;s disrespectful .
thanks for coming .
fucking motherfucking pain in the fucking ass !
could we not , huh ? with the tantrums ?
for this i miss the jets game ?
did they say when your making ceremony might happen , with this delay ?
stop asking fucking questions . if i knew , i couldn &apos;t tell you .
hit me . hit me .
every little bit helps . anything to get through these events .
hey .
what a fucking blow .
you too ?
i &apos;m serious .
breaking the terms of your house arrest ?
i got a dispensation .
she &apos;s my sister @-@ in @-@ law , for chrissake .
my dad &apos;s very ill too .
thanks . thanks for coming .
allow me to express my condolences .
thanks , assemblyman .
i met your mom once or twice . that was a proud newarker .
oh , hey . reverend .

you know state assemblyman zellman , right ? 8th ward ?
do i know him ? you bet .
yes , we go way back . how are you ?
reverend .
uncle jun ? you all right ?
they &apos;re dropping like fucking flies .
it &apos;s that charcoal @-@ broiled meat .
nobody told us !
i &apos;m kidding , you fuck . what &apos;s the matter ?
you wanted to talk ?
i gotta talk to your wife .
jun , come on .
this is a funeral . enough of her soign ? attitude .
what do you want ?
to use this sad occasion ...
... to put bitterness and sore @-@ headed feelings aside .
i &apos;ll behave how tony wants . i don &apos;t want to add to his stress .
there they are .
hi , uncle jun.
how &apos;s that surfboard i gave you ?
tony &apos;s waiting .
ralphie cifaretto got word to me .
what does he want ?
a bump up to captain .
the kid &apos;s been a top earner since that rat bastard went in the program .
he whipped his crew into shape .
three months ago , the rat bastard was the second coming .
i &apos;m boss . you forget .
i forget nothing .
don &apos;t make me say things we &apos;d regret .
go ahead , i &apos;m fed up .
hey .
i &apos;m on the street . that &apos;s the arrangement .
stay home , clip coupons .
things are good , but the economy &apos;s so robust ...
... you get credit for everything . chinks and housewives bet football .
you better be finished .
joe zachary ?
yeah .
oh , boys . no fires .
tony doesn &apos;t want any fires .
i ain &apos; t so tough .
well , what do you think ?
can &apos; t say .
hope for the best .
doctor , this is tom &apos;s mother , brother , and miss doyle .
the lord bless her and keep her .
the lord make his face to shine upon her and be gracious to her .
the lord lift up his countenance upon her and give her peace .
amen .
did you talk to her ?
she &apos;s sure you said something .
he won &apos;t discuss it . he clams up .
beautiful sendoff , t.
thank you .
i want to thank you for all you &apos;ve done for her .
she was much work . in end , she defeated me .
we won &apos;t need your services anymore .
i &apos;ll be moving in . if you could get your stuff out ...
... that &apos;d be good .
i stay there only during week , when my fianc ? has his children .
tony says i can continue situation till bill and me find house .
tony should have consulted me . i &apos;ll be living at 55 benedek ...
... while we deal with the estate .
speaking of which , my mom had an extensive record collection .
caruso , robert merrill , a shitload of broadway shows .
do you know where they are ?
she gave to me those records .
what ?
she know i like american show tunes . i didn &apos;t ask .
they &apos;re my mother &apos;s records . i feel very close to them .
i don &apos;t want make a trouble , but i have to respect her wishes .
this is just about you bogarting those discs for your ass .
they &apos;re worth a fortune .
i will not answer such here .
i want the entire discography back at the house by this weekend .
mrs. s.
how are you ?
sit down . how &apos;s your mother ?
you call her every day .
mom passed away .
really ? when ?
about six months ago .
please , give her my regards .
is she still on that crazy diet ?
i brought you something .
from my restaurant . i don &apos;t know if you remember , vesuvio ?
mrs. s ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
after what my son did to you ?
how can i look you in the face ?
what now ?
you don &apos;t blame him for the fire ?
artie , what are you doing ?
come on , we have people arriving . let &apos;s go .
thank you so much . thank you .
i &apos;m so sorry .
look at her .
she &apos;s becoming a robot , like us .
i &apos;m so sorry .
at least she didn &apos;t suffer .
all her innocence is gone .
then the rabbi has to extol the virtues of the deceased .
the rabbi says , &quot; i did not know this man . i &apos;m new .
you knew him . say something good . &quot;
silence . goes on for about a minute .
finally , from the back :
&quot; his brother was worse . &quot;
i walk out with the provolone , and he thinks i smell like that !
this survivor . i should find the winner , pull out a gun and say :
&quot; you &apos;re not gonna survive unless you give me 25 % of that million dollars . &quot;
not bad . we could find out where they live .
&quot; see how you survive this , pezzo di merda . &quot;
everyone , please . may i have your attention ?
we would like to ask you all to join us in the great room .
form a circle , sit anywhere , get comfortable ...
... so that we can all be together and share a remembrance ...
... about the woman who brought us here .
goddamn it .
please , join us .
paulie gualtieri ? join us , please ?
thank you .
what the fuck did i say ?
if you &apos;d rather , i can invite them to her place .
janice , what are you doing ?
very good .
we can all take a break from eating for five minutes .
most of you will probably remember that this was her favorite song .
it might help us get rolling .
herman rabkin ?
you two went back . almost to the pyramids .
i guess what struck me most was ...
... she didn &apos;t mince words .
between brain and mouth , there was no interlocutor .
anthony jr .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
come on .
lay off , janice . move on .
she was my best friend .
if anybody died or was in the hospital ...
... i &apos;d get a call from li letting me know .
thank you , fanny . thank you .
okay . what &apos;s good for the goose ...
most of you remember that i have an extraordinary visual sense .
as a child , mom didn &apos;t let me rest on those laurels .
she didn &apos;t flatter me .
she believed that wildflowers blossom best ...
... among the rocks , with little water .
she was tough .
but she was right .
she &apos;s the reason i make videos today .
tony ?
maybe you &apos;d like to tell them how ma ...
... saved all your childhood schoolwork and none of mine or barbara &apos;s .
you just did . wrap it up , janice .
i hear she didn &apos;t suffer .
for that , we can be grateful .
thank you .
they say there &apos;s no two people on earth exactly the same .
no two faces , no two sets of fingerprints .
but do they know for sure ?
because they would have to get everybody together in one huge space .
obviously , that &apos;s not possible , even with computers .
they &apos;d have to get everyone who ever lived , not just the ones now .
so they got no proof . they got nothing .
hey .
so , ton , she &apos;s dead .
what ?
i guess our little secret ...
... dies with her .
hey , pick that up !
what am i doing out here ?
everyone &apos;s telling stories of her . i got a beaut !
artie .
don &apos;t talk about that !
she may have passed , but who &apos;s to say there &apos;s not another just like her ?
maybe not with the same fears and paranoia , but ...
... the same .
what i &apos;m saying is ...
thank you , chris . thank you .
this is such a crock of shit .
carmela !
on one hand , i want to protect my children from the truth .
on the other , i &apos;m saying , &quot; what kind of example am i setting ? &quot;
evading and smiling , passing out cheese puffs .
over a woman who was terribly dysfunctional .
who spread no cheer at all .
carmela , be quiet .
this is my house !
i &apos;m leaving .
let her talk !
i &apos;ll speak if i want ! who are you ?
minister of propaganda ?
we suffered for years under the yoke of that woman .
she estranged us from our own daughter .
ruined i don &apos;t know how many goddamned christmases .
no , don &apos;t hand me that ! bullshit !
you wanted it , you got it .
hear , hear .
from beyond the grave even .
this woman didn &apos;t want a funeral .
you all , her children , ignored her wishes .
only after she &apos;s dead , by the way .
she didn &apos;t want a funeral . she didn &apos;t want remembrance .
why ?
she didn &apos;t think anybody would come !
she wouldn &apos;t write down her memories ...
... because nobody loved her enough to read them .
she knew there was a problem .
there &apos;s desserts ...
... in the dining room , if anybody wants some .
yes .
and they &apos;re all from vesuvio .
our new pastry chef , bobby vasquez . thanks .
tommy ? mike &apos;s here .
he &apos;s come to see you .
you must like mike a lot better than me .
no , tommy boy . you &apos;re my baby .
you &apos;re going to get well and strong .
all of us . together again .
i &apos;m almost glad this happened .
yeah ? this is mike .
when ?
you are ? fine .
they &apos;re bringing tom home .
when ?
right now . he &apos;s on his way .
wonderful !
