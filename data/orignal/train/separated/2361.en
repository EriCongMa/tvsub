You must be Elena. How do we look exactly alike?
You're a petrova doppelganger.
You're the key to breaking the curse.
The sun and the moon curse?
Klaus is the real deal.
From the first generation of vampires.
The oldest vampire in the history of time
is coming after me?
Elijah.
One of the originals. He's a legend.
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
What kind of a deal?
You and I shall draw Klaus out together
and I shall make certain
that your friends remain unharmed.
And then what?
Then I kill him.
I come bearing gifts.This is how you kill an original.
Killing Elijah would be a suicide mission.
You can't do it.
Even with the dagger and a little white out cash?
If you kill Elijah, then I'm stuck in here forever.
As long as we keep the dagger in there,
Then he stays dead.
Pretty much.
How did you get out?
I knew that I had begged you not to kill Elijah,
that's exactly what you'd do.
As soon as originals die, compulsion wears off.
What did Luka tell you?
About your daughter. I know where Klaus has her.
I want to help you get her back.
No!
He took my powers.
Stefan, we're late for school.
Let's be later.
Stefan, it's school.
Remember, that thing that we keep forgetting about?
School?
Doesn't ring a bell.
Stefan! Ok, 5 minutes. Only for 5 minutes.
Good morning, Damon.
What are you doing here? I told you to leave.
What is your problem?
You're wearing her clothes? Like that's going to work.
You think I'm Katherine?
Why would you think that? Katherine's in a tomb!
Isn't she?
What the hell's going on here?
I don't know, you tell me.
Is Katherine in the tomb or not?
What are you doing?!
How could you do this?!
Stefan, you're hurting me!
Stop it, Katherine!
Stop what?
It's getting really easy being you.
What is she doing here?
When we killed Elijah,
it broke the compulsion and freed the bitch from the tomb.
How's that possible?
He's an original.
They have all sorts of special skills.
I don't want you here. Get her out of here.
You need me, Elena.
You all do.
Like hell.
We all want the same thing--Klaus dead.
Yet here you all are, running around like chickens
with their heads cut off.
I don't need your help.
And I don't want it.
And that's incredibly stupid of you.
Do you know where Klaus is?
When he's coming, what he looks like?
If you know something, say it or get out.
Fine. Then I'll just go to the grill
and have some lunch. Maybe aunt Jenna's
free for a bite.
Hey, Matt.
Live band?
Yeah, business has been a little slow.
The grill's trying to stay afloat.
Aren't we all?
Have you heard from Tyler?
Not a peep. You?
No, not since he stopped by the grill to talk
and I've left messages on his cell phone.
He stopped by to see you?
What did he say?
Not much, really.
I mean...I think
To say good-bye without
really saying good-bye. I just didn't know.
And that's all he said?
Yeah, that's all he said, Caroline.
Why? I mean, is there something you want to tell me?
Yeah! I--
I mean, no, I--
It's just not that easy.
I don't get it. Since when
have I been the one that can express himself
and you're one with a loss for words.
No, you're right, and I'm sorry.
You know how I feel.
So it's your move.
Just make a decision
or leave me alone.
Why is she still here?
She was free.
She wants what we want, Klaus's death.
Maybe this is her only chance.
Or maybe she's trying to lure you and Damon back into her web.
I want her gone.
So do I.
But you're right, she's staying.
Shouldn't we at least try to figure out why?
How? All she does is lie.
Look, I hate it as much as you do, but she does make a point.
We don't know anything about Klaus.
She does.
Right, but that doesn't mean
I want her shacking up with you.
Maybe we should stay at your place tonight.
Hmm, I can't. I told Bonnie and Caroline
that they could come over. Bonnie's freaked
because she lost her powers
and Caroline's having Matt drama again.
It's kind of a girls' night.
Maybe Katherine can join us.
Come on.
Mmm, burning flesh.
If you're trying to get the dagger back,
you're wasting your time. He's indestructible.
No kidding.
How do you know so much about original vampires?
Spend 500 years running from one.
So when I told you my plan to kill Elijah,
why didn't you warn me
that I'd die if I used a dagger on him?
Oh, there's so many rules. It's all very confusing.
Did you know I would die?
Did Elijah tell you his plan?
Did he have a dagger to kill Klaus with?
Why are you still here?
Because you haven't forcibly removed me.
You wouldn't.
Oh, I would.
Damon, be smart.
I want Klaus dead just as much as you do.
More.
If I wasn't be honest about helping,
I'd be long gone by now, OK?
You can hate me.
But we want the same thing.
And you know...
I always get what I want.
I wanted out of the tomb.
Didn't matter who paid the price.
Of course I knew that you'd die.
She's out of the tomb?
Yeah. We're dealing with it, all right?
Just be extra careful.
She's getting a little too good at impersonating Elena.
With Katherine still around,
we gotta find a way to get your powers back.
Listen, I want to get the Martins on our side.
I want to figure out a way for us all to work together
now that Elijah's out of the picture.
It's impossible. They hate us.
It's either win them over or somebody's going to end up dead.
You think you can at least
convince them to have a civil conversation?
I'll try.
Thanks. Keep me posted.
Ok. I gotta get to class.
All right, I'll see ya.
Come on.
Elena's nowhere in sight.
I'll tell her soon. I promise.
All right.
It was bad. You know, John planted all these seeds about Isobel
and now Jenna knows I'm lying about something.
John's going to end up dead on the kitchen floor if he's not careful.
Yeah, well, easier said than done.
I gave him back his ring.
So.
Look, Jenna keeps asking about Isobel.
You know, was she murdered?
Why haven't they found the body?
I mean, how much longer can she stay in the dark?
You think we should tell her the truth?
I'm saying I can't be with her and not tell her.
It's not fair to her,
and it's not the kind of relationship I want.
Not to mention it's becoming more dangerous for her not to know.
I just thought that we'd at least hold off
until after we've dealt with klaus.
You know, and even then,
how do we tell someone what we know?
How does someone hear that?
Look, I'm sorry to put this on you.
But I feel it's your decision to make.
And whatever you decide to do, I'll respect it.
I want to be honest with her. But until then,
Jenna and I are done.
Thank you for coming.
I didn't want to.
But my son made a case to hear you out.
Bonnie said that you have information about Elijah.
Elijah's dead. I'm sorry.
Hear me out. We can help you.
We know that Klaus has your daughter.
I'm sorry about the way I had to get that information,
but it's good that we know.
We can all work together to get her back.
How?
I suspect that you and Elijah had a plan to kill Klaus.
I'll just help you carry it out.
You can trust us.
I give you my word. We all do.
What you up to?
None of your business.
We're pouting now?
Are those the Gilbert journals?
How am I supposed to help you if you won't tell me what you're up to?
Can you tell me where a bunch of witches
were massacred in this town a couple centuries ago?
No.
Then you can't help.
If it's any consolation,
I'm glad that you're not dead.
Emily Bennett told me about the massacre.
It was a big deal in witch folklore.
When a witch dies violently,
they release a mystical energy
making the place of their death with power.
I think Elijah wanted to know the site of the massacre.
What was he going to do when he found it?
I don't know.
What did papa witch and baby witch have to say?
Wasn't she gone or dead? Yeah?
For the last time, I'm here to help.
Can we skip the secrets, hmm?
Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.
But he believed that if a witch could channel enough power...
They wouldn't need one.
Like the power you get from
a spot marked with a hundred dead witches?
We just need to find it.
But what if they can find the burial ground?
They won't. We tried, Luka, for weeks.
We don't have a back-up plan, though, dad,
and we need to be doing everything we can to save Greta.
We will save her.
But Elijah is the answer,
not Stefan and his brother.
Those people, they're our enemies.
They need to be dealt with.
You're going to kill them?
No.
I'm going to let Elijah do it.
Chinese food or pizza?
Like you have to ask.
I will get it.
I'll do it.
Do you believe that Jonas is being sincere?
I don't know what to believe.
I think he's at a loss. He's not sure who to trust.
Join the club.
Well, what are we going to do about this movie situation?
What about "The Notebook"?
Caroline, how many times have you seen that movie?
That is so not the point.
Well, yeah, I mean...
What's going on?
Girls' night.
How are you doing?
You heard about my fight with Rick.
He feels terrible.
Is this some kind of disguised attempt to cheer me up?
No. No, this is about us girls hanging out.
And, you know, we'll be here if you happen to want to talk,
or...
Because I am a winner
when it comes to successful relationships.
You, too?
You have no idea.
Ok, then.
It's this whole Isobel thing.
He's hiding something from me.
To play devil's advocate,
maybe there is a great reason why he's not telling you.
Maybe he is just trying to protect you.
Well, that's not his call to make.
I mean, I deserve the truth. Everybody does.
Sometimes it's harder than that.
Not if it's somebody you care about, it isn't?
You know what we need?
Dancing. There is a band at the Grill.
I'm in.
In.
In.
Are you sure about this?
I mean, I would go if I could.
No. I'm not strong enough to send you.
I can do this.
I'll stay anchored.
Use all my energy.
If you feel weak... Dad.
I want this just as much as you.
Concentrate on Elijah.
Picture him in your mind.
I got it.
I'm in the Salvatore house.
Elijah's body must be there.
What do you see?
Elena and Damon. They're reading.
Good.
If Elijah's there, you'll sense him.
Stay focused.
Can I help you?
I'm bored.
"Emily Bennett was taken by the council today.
"They kidnapped her from her home
"And took her to the same location
Her ancestors were burned a hundred years ago."
So Emily died on the site of the massacre, too.
Does it say where?
Nope.
You know this whole friendly, cooperative thing?
Mm-hmm.
I don't buy it.
I have no reason to lie to you, Damon.
Lie.
I'm hungry.
You're the unwanted houseguest.
Go feed yourself.
Well, nothing in any of those.
Find anything?
Nope.
That's too bad.
Yeah, bummer.
Elena's fighting me.
what's wrong?
She's stronger than me.
That's because it's not Elena.
It's Katherine Pierce. Luka. Kill her.
What? She's a vampire.
Find a stake and drive it through her heart.
Damon!
Katherine!
What happened?
Damon...
Luka, what's going on?
Luka! Luka!
What are you doing?!
Shutting down a crazy ass psychic witch attack!
Get over there and do something about it.
Now!
No!
Oh, my god! Luka!
Luka! I'm sorry.
Please.
Just wake up, son.
Open your eyes.
Luka!
I love my boy!
I need a drink.
Hey, Matt.
Things just got real awkward.
Jenna. Not tonight, Ric.
Tonight I have traded you for senor tequila.
Yeah.
Well, senor tequila's not going to
be treating you very well.
Well, the two of you have a lot in common.
Look, Jenna, I hate that you're this upset with me.
Yeah, well, it's your fault.
Because whatever it is you're keeping from me;
Whatever you think I can't handle...
You're wrong.
'cause last year I was a grad student
who smoked a lot of pot
and couldn't keep a goldfish alive.
And now I'm a parent,
so I think I can handle anything, Ric.
Jenna...
He said the ball's in your court.
Yeah, but I can't do anything about it.
Why not?
All you do is talk about how much you care about him.
Yeah, but I am still keeping so many secrets.
Alaric's in the same boat with Jenna.
And maybe that's our mistake.
We're trying to protect the people that we love
by keeping them out of it,
but in the end, we're hurting them anyway.
What are you doing?
Where are you going? What is she doing?
Hey, everybody.
Let's hear it for the band!
Weren't they awesome?
This isn't going to end well.
So there's this guy.
And, uh,
he told me to tell him how I feel about him.
Like it's so easy.
Um, you know,
Just 'cause I talk a lot doesn't mean I always know
what I'm actually talking about.
Ah, like now, I'm feeling loopy
and I don't really know how to express myself.
I can sing.
Sing
Yeah! Yeah.
You know what, I'm going to sing.
Come on, off the stage.
You are going to let me live out my rock star fantasies,
and you are going to be my back-up.
What will it be?
Close your eyes, give me your hand? Darlin'
Do you feel my heart beating?
She's good.
Do you understand? Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning
an eternal flame?
I believe it's meant to be.
Darlin' I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me? Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning an eternal flame?
Say my name, sun shines through the rain
Oh, life, so lonely. You come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling
Oh. No.
Matt, I--
You killed him! Aah!
He's dead and I have no one.
And now you're about to find out exactly what that feels like.
There you go.
What the hell?!
That's for not telling me the dagger would kill me.
Next time...
It goes in your heart.
Is that how you treat someone who--
Is trying to help you?
Want to help?
Start talking.
I'd love to, but you're not going to like it.
Try me.
Fine. John Gilbert and Isobel want you and Stefan
Out of Elena's life.
Old news.
Not the part where he offered me a deal.
He knew that killing Elijah would get me out of the tomb,
so he gave me a choice.
Either I stay and help with klaus,
Or he kills Stefan.
But he still tried to have me killed.
Right.
That was part of the deal.
I could only save one of you.
So you chose Stefan.
Of course you did.
You wanted the truth, Damon.
Would you rather I lie?
Ahh! Oh, sorry.
Sorry, Elena.
You know, I really have to get back to work.
Definitely.
I--I wouldn't. Caroline and matt are...
In the bathroom?!
If they're happy,
I'm happy.
Um, hey,
speaking of happy,
would it freak you out if I started dating your brother?
You're into my brother?
I know it's weird, um,
but he's been so good and strong.
It makes me happy.
And I really can't tell what you're thinking...
Right now.
I'm thinking that...
My brother has had more pain in his life
than a hundred people's worth of pain,
and...
He deserves to be with someone as amazing as you.
Really?
Really.
Oh! My phone.
Hey, stefan, I'm at the Grill.
I can't hear you. Hold--yeah.
Where are you going?
Luka Martin's dead. His father's going after elena.
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
Wait.
I don't need your help. I don't want it.
I know what we can do, Damon.
You have to let me do it.
Dr. Martin. You ok?
Where is she?
I don't understand.
My son is dead.
Whatever it is you think you need to do,
there's a better way.
They killed Elijah and they killed Luka.
And my only shot at getting my daughter back
is if I have Elena.
No. No, Dr. Martin.
Where is she?
I don't know. I haven't seen her.
What the hell?
The power's out.
Even better.
I wish, but I should probably--whoa.
We have a problem.
What's going on?
Jonas is here and he's after Elena.
Oh, my god!
We have a plan, but I need to get Elena out of here.
Well, what can I do?
It's time to get out of here. I have to find Elena.
She's with Stefan, she's ok.
No one's getting out of here until I have her.
Don't do this. Please don't do this.
Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie.
Come on. Come on.
Dr. Martin! I'm so sorry about Luka.
I never wanted that to happen,
But...At least let us help you get your daughter back.
Only Elijah can do that.
You don't need Elijah.
Caroline!
Get away from her!
Matt, no!
Matt!
Matt! No!
Matt! Matt!
Oh! Oh, my god!
Ok. Uh...
Just breath, Caroline, just breath.
You have to drink. Please, please.
Luka...
I can't believe he's dead.
After what we did to him.
No, after what he did to you.
Look, I'm sorry, I know you feel bad about all of this,
But I don't.
I couldn't do anything to help.
I was useless.
I hated it.
Thank god.
It's not over yet.
What's going on?
He'll explain.
When did you guys get home?
A few minutes ago.
Did you check the house?
And why would we check the house?
You're welcome.
You didn't have to kill him!
Yes, we did.
Get off!
How did you guys convince her to do this?
We didn't. It was actually her idea.
Wow. That's... Not good.
No. No, that's not good at all.
Everything's taken care of.
I'm guessing you're going to want this back.
But your pretty little outfit
is going to need a good dry clean.
You're going to have to
get her out of here before Jenna gets home.
Is that all you have to say to me?
This doesn't change the way I feel about you.
I don't much like you, either, if we're going to be open.
And frankly, I'd be happy to see you dead,
But if we're going to try to take on Klaus,
we kinda need you to be alive.
So I'm not a threat to you, Elena.
If any of you are going to believe anything,
Believe that.
Thanks for getting me home.
That was kind of crazy.
Jenna, are you going to be ok?
Look, Isobel is dead.
And there are things about her death
that I can't tell you;
That aren't for me to tell.
You can be upset and hate me.
I get it.
But just know that I love you.
At least I can tell you that much.
Good night, Ric.
Good night.
You made it home.
Tonight was very weird.
Tell me about it.
I'm worried about you.
Don't be.
No, I'm serious, Bonnie.
The only witch that could given you your powers back is dead,
And...I think you have a serious case of denial going,
And I want you to know
that I'm here for you no matter what, and...
Not that denial's the worst thing.
Did you...
When he grabbed me...
He gave me my powers back.
And something else.
Jonas wants me to kill Klaus.
And did he include a how?
Yeah.
He did.
You know what I can't figure out?
What's that?
How the town knew Emily Bennett was a witch.
I mean, because according to Johnathan Gilbert,
He was the only one who knew.
I know he didn't turn her in.
Mmm, I should have figured as much.
Oh, she was a loose end. I like mine tied up.
You know what I can't figure out?
Do I care?
Why you won't tell me where to find the site
of the witch massacre.
Because I have no clue.
You knew that Emily Bennett
was the key to getting me out of that tomb.
And something tells me that you did everything in your power
to make sure that she was safe,
Yet you have no idea where she was killed.
Who's the liar now?
You hurt me today.
Tit for tat.
You were mean.
And very rough.
And monstrous.
You deserved it.
I like this Damon.
Katherine.
Katherine, there are six other bedrooms in this house.
Go find one.
What the hell?
I had your face...
And all the blood. I-I drank your blood.
You were dying.
My blood healed you.
What do you mean, it healed me?
How can your blood heal me?
Because that's what vampire blood does for humans,
And that's what I am.
I'm a vampire, Matt.
No.
But it's all going to be ok,
Because I am going to tell you everything,
And you're going to understand why I had to keep it from you,
And we're going to be fine.
We'll be fine?!
Yes, because we're together and we love each other.
Vampires.
Oh, my god.
Vickie, oh, my god, at the hospital,
I thought that she was tripping out.
What?
Vickie, she knew about the vampires,
And I...
What--what did you do?
Nothing. Nothing! Matt!
I need to get out of here.
No, no, no! I can't let you leave. I cannot let you leave.
What did you do to my sister?
Nothing! Nothing! I swear, I swear, nothing, nothing!
What did you do?!
Nothing, Matt!
You have to calm down! Matt!
Are John and Jeremy asleep?
I think so.
If I go to bed right now,
There's a chance I'll wake up hangover-free.
Who's that?
Hi. You must be Jenna.
I'm...
Elena's mother.
