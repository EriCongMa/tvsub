ross , she is really young .
does everyone feel this way ?
yeah , sort of .
sorry .
i thought you were just making jokes . i had no idea .
you guys are wrong .
yes , there is a chronological age difference .
but i never notice it , because she is very mature .
it doesn &apos;t matter what you guys think .
i &apos;m dating elizabeth , not you .
not what she said last night .
see , now , he could date her .
will you marry me ?
will you marry me ?
hey , you marry me .

you look beautiful .
thank you .
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re just really ... excited about this charity event we have to go to .
here .
thank you .
so , what &apos;s going on here ?
well , this is a silent auction .
they lay the stuff here . you write down your offer .
then the highest bid gets it .
i know what a silent auction is .
what &apos;s going on with your hair ?
why ?
no , it &apos;s nice .
nice to see you . so glad you brought someone .
someone ? i brought people . mr. thompson , this is phoebe
phoebe , this is mr. thompson.he &apos;s the head of my department .

finally , our biggest item .
the 22 @-@ foot gentleman &apos;s daysailer sailboat .
the winning bid was a whopping $ 20,000 .
i won.that was my guess .
what ? what ? what ?
i guessed $ 20,000 .
joey , it is an auction . you don &apos;t guess . you buy !
what ?
i don &apos;t have $ 20,000 .
congratulations on your new boat , joey tribbiani .
joey , sit down .
forget her . you enjoy this .
what are you doing ?
&quot; one nation ... under god ,
indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . &quot;
i remembered it . the champagne is here .
you okay ?
yes . i &apos;m good . are you good ? is everything .. ? are you perfect ?
yeah . i &apos;m okay.actually , i &apos;m a bit cold .
can i have your jacket ?
no , you can &apos;t have my jacket .
because then i would be cold .
if you thought you &apos;d be cold , you should &apos;ve brought a jacket .
but , other than that , are you okay ?
are you sure you &apos;re okay ?
yes . i &apos;m fine .
in fact , i &apos;ve been fine for a long time now and i think ...
the reason is you .
that &apos;s sweet .
okey
before i met you , i had really little life .
and i couldn &apos;t imagine growing old ..
oh , my god.-i know . but let me say it .
richard .
what ? i &apos;m chandler .
oh , that &apos;s richard .
maybe he won &apos;t see us . richard !
monica . chandler .
i don &apos;t know why i did that .
good to see you .
you too . you let your hair grow .
that &apos;s right . you always wanted me to .
i see your mustache is back .
well , my nose got lonely .
you don &apos;t have a mustache , which is good .
chandler . i make jokes when i &apos;m uncomfortable .
hi , i &apos;m lisa . -hi .
i &apos;m sorry . lisa ,
monica , chandler . we used to date
richard , no one &apos;s supposed to know about us .
see ? i did it again .
chandler , sit down .
i &apos;ll sit down .
good to see you .
your table &apos;s ready , sir .
good to see you guys .
if you prefer , this table &apos;s available .
that might be fun .
what were you thinking ?
i didn &apos;t know it was an auction .
i figured i &apos;d take a guess . help a charity . free boat !
why would a charity give away a boat ?
i don &apos;t know . charity ?
well , just buy the damn boat .
don &apos;t you think you &apos;ve had enough to drink ?
i &apos;m just helping the kids .
how is you drinking helping the kids ?
because the more i drink , the less there is for the kids to drink .
mr. tribbiani ,
your contribution brings us ... a step closer to building the youth center .
i &apos;m so happy you brought him .
so am i.
i &apos;m curious . how much is that boat worth ?
i think it was valued at 19,000 .
hey , i was pretty close .
so , bad news.i can &apos;t buy the boat . i don &apos;t have any money .
joey ! joey , good one . he &apos;s silly .
good ! very good !
so i think i &apos;m gonna take off now .
you can &apos;t leave , joey !
you agreed to buy that boat . it &apos;s a contract .
plus , if you leave , my boss will kill me .
i don &apos;t have that kind of money .
i know . okay , okay .
this is what we &apos;ll do.we &apos;ll let the next highest bidder buy it .
then you &apos;ll pay the difference .
okay .
i don &apos;t know why the kids need a youth center anyway .
they should just watch tv after school like i did .
i turned out fine .
not great .
i &apos;m helping the kids so much i think i &apos;m gonna throw up .
so we &apos;re hiding in the bathroom ...
i get out .
but before she can , her parents come in .
i hide in the shower . they start going at it on the floor .
oh , my god !
i got a good one .
i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy .
it &apos;s so great seeing you guys again . i &apos;d like to make a toast .
as a poet once said , &quot; in the sweetness of friendship ...
let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures .
in the dew of little things , the heart finds its morning and is refreshed . &quot;
what ?
oh , my god ! you guys !
have we got a story for you .
guess who we bumped into ? -who ?
richard ! -what ?
right , that &apos;s richard &apos;s favorite place too .
oh , you knew that ? good .
weren &apos;t you going out with elizabeth ?
i was . she was a little busy with a water balloon fight .
sometimes grownups have commitments they can &apos;t get out of .
maybe she is too young for me .
when i was over there , i felt like i was a babysitter .
i see what you were talking about .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
weigh the good stuff about her against the bad .
that &apos;s what i did when i first started ...
weighing stuff .
okay , bad stuff .
i &apos;m 12 years older than she is .
the school could fire you .
she &apos;s leaving for three months .
for camp .
okay , good stuff .
well , she &apos;s sweet and pretty and ..
and the sex is probably great , huh ?
it &apos;s tender and respectful , if that &apos;s what you mean .
the only thing you need to ask is , &quot; do you see a future ? &quot;
do you see yourself marrying her ?
my god . you married her , didn &apos;t you ?
no , i didn &apos;t do that . it &apos;s just ...
okay , honestly , no . i don &apos;t see a big future with her .
okay , i think that &apos;s your answer .
i gotta talk to her . i hate this part .
forget elizabeth .
if you &apos;re not careful ... you may not get married at all this year .
weren &apos;t you supposed to do something ?
good luck with elizabeth , my man .
my god , phoebe , how many have you had ?
1,2,3 ... seven times three .. 21 !
you must be just wasted !
i &apos;m a little tired .
rach
next highest bidder is at table one .
great .
the guy with the paris trip is at table four .
why do you care about who won ?
it &apos;s a trip for two.excuse me .
is the person who won the paris trip at this table ?
that was me .
enchante .
is there a mr. bowmont at this table ?
that &apos;s me .
well , hello . this is your lucky day , mr. bowmont .
the gentleman daysailer has become available again ...
and i believe you made a bid of $ 18,000 .
you have to pay that . it &apos;s not just a guess .
i was relieved i didn &apos;t win . my wife would &apos;ve killed me .
you kidding ? she &apos;ll love this boat !
what is your wife &apos;s name ?
pam
just imagine this :
the pam
i don &apos;t think she &apos;d like that .
okay . imagine this : the mr. bowmont .
i don &apos;t think so .
let me paint you a little picture
you are setting sail up the hudson .
you &apos;ve got the wind in your ... arms .
you get all that peace and quiet you &apos;ve always wanted .
you get back to nature . you can go fishing .
you get one of those hats . people call you captain .
and then when you &apos;re old , cappy .
it &apos;s for a good cause . all right .
no way ! it &apos;s mine !
what ?
the stuff you said , i want that !
but you don &apos;t have $ 20,000 !
who cares ? i &apos;ll make payments ! i want the mr. bowmont !
oh , my god . you &apos;re back .
let me see it . let me see your hand .
why do you wanna see my hand ?
i wanna see what &apos;s in your hand . i wanna see the trash .
it &apos;s all dirty . you should throw this out .
okey
what did you just do ?
what happened ?
richard was there . i couldn &apos;t do it .
oh , no .
i was gonna surprise her tomorrow.now you &apos;ve ruined it .
we didn &apos;t .
who walks in a room and asks to see a person &apos;s hands ?
a palm reader , a manicurist , a hand doctor ...
glove salesman .
good one !
this is terrible . what will i do ?
she only suspects something . so just throw her off the track .
i &apos;ll pretend marriage is the last thing on my mind .
convince her you &apos;re scared of commitment ,
that you &apos;re a coward .
i can do that . i &apos;ve had years of practice .
being you is finally gonna pay off !
i had to go all the way to the basement because
some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes .
that guy is still doing that ?
oh , my god . let me see your hand !
you &apos;re too late ! she already took out the trash !
look , elizabeth , we have to talk .
i have never had such a healthy breakup .
she was such a grownup about it .
she didn &apos;t seem too immature for me .
did i just make a huge mistake ?
ross ! wait !
elizabeth , thank god . i was just thinking about ..
you suck !
what ?
breakup &apos;s still on
here she comes . do i look like i don &apos;t wanna get married ?
and , also , a little like a french guy .
i never noticed that before .
what are you up to ?
hanging out . talking about websites .
we saw this interesting website about marriage ... and how unnecessary it is ,
a way for the government to keep tabs .
yeah , big brother .
that &apos;s a bit crazy.although i am glad you &apos;re looking at other things on the lnternet .
got me thinking . why would anybody want to get married ?
to celebrate the relationship , solidify the commitment ...
declare your love for one another to the world .
well , that &apos;s good to know .
the mr. bowmont is here !
a diner wants to compliment you .
shall i let him in ?
sure . i love this part .
come on in . -hi .
richard .
i &apos;m not here to compliment the chef .
i hate when people come back to compliment the chef .
like i have nothing better to do .
so , what &apos;s up ?
it was great seeing you the other night .
good to see you too .
you came to tell me that ?
i came to tell you something else .
i came here to tell you i still love you .
what ? what did you .. ? what ?
i still love you .
i know i shouldn &apos;t even be here telling you this .
you &apos;re with chandler , who i like .
if you say he &apos;s straight , i &apos;ll believe you .
after seeing you , i knew if i didn &apos;t tell you i &apos;d regret it .
letting you go was the stupidest thing i ever did .
you &apos;re really not supposed to be back here .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know this is the wrong time and the wrong place ...
but i had to tell you .
i wanna spend my life with you . i wanna marry you .
i wanna have kids with you .
oh , my god . why don &apos;t they put chairs back here ?
look , i know this is crazy , but am i too late ?
you &apos;re too late . where was all this three years ago ?
i know . i was an idiot .
i tried to forget you . i really did .
after our last lunch ,
i spent six months in africa trying to forget .
what did you do there ?
work with blind kids .
what are you doing to me ?
i &apos;m sorry , but this is not gonna happen .
that &apos;s fine . i &apos;ll walk away . i &apos;ll never bother you again .
only if you say chandler &apos;s willing to give you everything i am .
well , he is . i mean ...
marriage is all he talks about . my goodness !
in fact , i &apos;m the one making him wait .
you are ? why ?
why ?
because of the government .
isn &apos;t it incredible ? monica and chandler are getting married .
i know . they &apos;ll be so happy together .
how often do two best friends fall in love ?
not that often .
no .
i &apos;m so happy for them .
me too . so happy for them .
i &apos;m so happy and not at all jealous .
oh , no ! god , definitely not jealous .
i &apos;m probably 98 % happy and maybe 2 % jealous .
i mean , what &apos;s 2 % ? that &apos;s nothing .
totally .
i &apos;m like 90 / 10 .
yeah . me too .
have you guys seen chandler ?
no . but you know who was looking for you ?
tennille .
the marriage stuff you were saying yesterday ?
you don &apos;t believe that.sure , i do .
in fact , i think the concept of marriage is unnatural .
look at pigs . let &apos;s take a second here and look at pigs .
pigs don &apos;t mate for life .
a pig can have 100 sexual partners in a lifetime .
that &apos;s an ordinary pig , not even a pig that &apos;s good at sports .
yeah , but that &apos;s pigs , not people .
if marriage worked , i &apos;d be for it . do you know the divorce rate ? ninety @-@ seven percent !
wait a minute .
are you telling me you may never want to get married ?
who &apos;s to say ?
you ! you are to say !
never say never , but , probably ...
yeah , never .
oh , my god . then what are we even doing ? what is this ?
whoa , whoa , whoa ! what is all this pressure ?
is this some new strategy ?
why don &apos;t you put down your copy of the rules , huh , mantrap ?
you know what ? i gotta go .
it &apos;s okay . i got a plan .
we &apos;re gonna find love .
definitely .
yeah , i &apos;m pretty confident about that .
that &apos;s what makes it so easy to be 80 % happy for monica and chandler .
a guarantee would be nice .
what do you mean ?
some friends make a deal .
like if neither of them are married by 40 , they marry each other .
a backup ?
exactly .
yeah , i &apos;ve got that .
you do ?
who ?
joey .
joey ?
are you serious ?
i locked him in years ago .
wait . so if neither of you are married by 40,
you &apos;ll marry joey ?
yep . we shook on it .
but believe me , that is not how he wanted to seal the deal .
oh , seriously ?
i think his exact words were ..
charming .
he &apos;s just a backup .
hey , monica .
have you seen rachel ? or a mirror ?
it &apos;s for my boat . pretty cool , huh ?
yeah , it &apos;s great .
what &apos;s wrong ? talk to the captain .
just realizing i &apos;m in a dead @-@ end relationship .
chandler being difficult ?
i don &apos;t want marriage tomorrow .
but i wanna know we &apos;re going somewhere , that i &apos;m not wasting time .
you know chandler .
no , i don &apos;t know chandler.not anymore .
it &apos;s like something &apos;s changed .
maybe you changed .
i didn &apos;t change .
maybe that &apos;s the problem .
what ?
chandler is a complex fellow.one who is unlikely to take a wife .
is that some kind of boat talk ?
i haven &apos;t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet .
does he think i &apos;ll wait around for nothing ?
face it . chandler is against marriage.and always will be
there &apos;s some people who do wanna marry me .
there are ?
yeah . richard .
richard said he wants to marry you ?
and chandler says he hates marriage ?
that &apos;s right .
chandler loves marriage !
you just said he hates marriage !
&quot; he &apos;s a complex fellow who &apos;s unlikely to take a wife &quot; !
&quot; he &apos;s against marriage and always will be &quot; !
you got that from what i said ?
after the cretaceous period , the dinosaurs were gone .
what happened , you guys ?
rach .
hey , you .
come on in .
thank you .
i &apos;m so sorry to hear about you and elizabeth .
thanks . i really thought we &apos;d be able to make it work .
i guess it wasn &apos;t meant to be .
yeah . love . it &apos;s a tricky business , isn &apos;t it ?
i guess so .
so , what do you say we make a pact ?
if you and i are both single by 40 , we get married .
i mean , we know each other , we like each other ...
we &apos;ve already slept together , so there &apos;ll be no surprises .
no , like , &quot; what &apos;s that ? &quot;
oh , you want me to be your backup .
exactly .
yeah . i already have one .
what ? who ?
phoebe .
phoebe ?
but she just said joey is her backup .
oh , i don &apos;t think so .
we just spoke . she said that she and joey made a deal .
that &apos;s impossible . we have had a deal for years . we shook on it .
although , believe me , she wanted to do a lot more than that .
gunther , it &apos;s joey . is chandler there ?
listen . what kind of muffins do they serve at sea ?
where the hell have you been ? !
i was making a coconut phone with the professor .
richard told monica he wants to marry her .
what ?
i &apos;ve been trying to find you .
and i would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn &apos;t keep flying off !
oh , my god !
i know ! they suck !
he &apos;s not supposed to ask her to marry him ! i am !
i know !
what .. ?
you know what i &apos;ll do ? i &apos;ll go over there and kick his ass !
will you help me ?
look , i don &apos;t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution , okay ?
look , just go and find monica .
you &apos;re right.okay.
i &apos;m gonna get the ring ...
i &apos;m gonna go find her and i &apos;m gonna propose !
dude ! dude ! dude !
that coconut phone might be good for the boat .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m here .
i didn &apos;t ask .
you wanna come in ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , okay .
i &apos;ll just leave the door open and sit on the couch .
chandler is such an idiot !
drink ?
scotch on the ..
rocks with a twist ? i remember .
you still smoking cigars ?
no , no . that &apos;s art .
if it bothers you , i can put my art out .
no , that &apos;s okay .
so , monica , let me ask you a question .
since we broke up , do you ever ... think about me ?
actually , i thought about you a few months ago .
really ?
but it &apos;s because ... i had an eye exam , and i don &apos;t like my new eye doctor .
who is it ?
edward nevsky .
he &apos;s no good .
do you ever think about me ... -in a non @-@ eye @-@ doctor way ?
no .
because getting over you was the hardest thing i &apos;ve ever done .
i never let myself think about you .
phoebe ,
you picked joey and ross ? you can &apos;t have two backups !
of course i can.it &apos;s good sense to back up your backup .
look , i &apos;ve already lost chandler .
what ?
hey , phoebe ! we &apos;re both your backup ?
how could you do this to me ?
why are you complaining ? you were both aware of the situation .
i was not !
no , we weren &apos;t !
this kind of backtalk won &apos;t fly when we &apos;re married .
you can &apos;t have both . pick one .
pick me !
no , pick me ! i don &apos;t wanna end up an old maid .
all right . well , let &apos;s see .
ross is a good father .
but ... joey has a boat . this is hard .
this is crazy . i wanna switch to rachel .
i wanna switch to rachel too .
no , wait . just wait .
wait , guys . don &apos;t make any rash decisions .
just remember my promise : if we get married , three times a week .
oh , my god . phoebe ... i &apos;m talking about massages .
no , i &apos;m not .
i know how to settle it . we &apos;ll do this .
i &apos;m gonna write &quot; joey &quot; on one napkin ... and &quot; ross &quot; on the other napkin
and we &apos;re gonna pick one.that person will be our backup .
okay ?
sounds fair .
all right.good. switching them up .
pick one .
left .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
ross .
joey .
we should switch .
absolutely .
i missed you , you ugly flat @-@ faced old freak .
excuse me ?
him .
i missed this apartment . now , this is a grownup &apos;s apartment .
i should be with a grownup , you know ?
you &apos;re saying you need to be with someone more mature .
maybe someone with ... a license to practice medicine .
or a mustache .
let &apos;s face it . i &apos;m not a kid anymore .
i need someone who wants the same things .
coming to my work and telling me you love me , i want that !
talking about pig sex over lunch , i don &apos;t want that !
i think that &apos;s fair .
please , don &apos;t even talk to me about fair .
fair would &apos;ve been you wanting to marry me then .
or chandler wanting to marry me now .
believe me , nothing about this is fair . nothing .
nothing ! nothing !
it &apos;s okay .
nothing .
i don &apos;t know.i don &apos;t know .
i know .
i have to figure some .. some stuff ,
before i can ... i understand .
take as much time as you want .
ten , even 20 minutes , if you need it .
i &apos;ll be here . not smoking .
chandler
where is she ? i &apos;m not scared of you .
she &apos;s not here . and please come in .
scotch on the rocks ... with a twist , on a coaster .
monica ?
okay , she was here . but she left .
where did she go ?
she said she had to think things over .
oh , my god . i can &apos;t believe this . i thought
you were a good guy .
look , nothing happened .
nothing ?
so you didn &apos;t tell my girlfriend you love her ?
well , all right , one thing happened .
you know what you did ?
my girlfriend is thinking things over .
you made my girlfriend think !
well , i &apos;m sorry .
what &apos;s to think about ? i love her . -well ...
i &apos;m willing to offer her things that you aren &apos;t .
i &apos;m willing to offer her those things . i had a plan ... to throw her off
so when i offered all these things , she &apos;d be surprised .
if it helps , it worked very well .
it was working till you showed up , you big tree .
this isn &apos;t fair .
you had your chance with her , and you blew it !
this is my chance . i won &apos;t blow it , because we are meant for each other .
and this has all just been one stupid mistake !
i was gonna propose tonight .
you were gonna propose ?
yeah , i even ...
got a ring . did you get a ring ?
no , i don &apos;t have a ring .
you go get her , chandler .
and can i give you a piece of advice ? if you do get her ...
don &apos;t let her go.trust me .
you know , richard , you are a good guy .
i know .
i hate that .
chandler
i &apos;ve gotta find monica .
she &apos;s gone .
what ?
she had a bag and she left .
what ?
she was all crying ... she said you guys want different things .
