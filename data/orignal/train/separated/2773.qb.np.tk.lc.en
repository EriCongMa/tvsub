this is pretty much what &apos;s happened so far .
ross was in love with rachel since forever .
every time he tried to tell her , something got in the way ...
... iike cats , italian guys .
and finally , chandler was , like , &quot; forget about her . &quot;
when ross was in china , chandler let it slip that ross loved rachel .
she was , like , &quot; oh , my god ! &quot;
so she went to the airport to meet him .
she didn &apos; t know ross was getting off the plane with another woman .
that &apos;s pretty much everything you need to know .
but enough about us . how have you been ?

it &apos;s an expression .
we just wanted to say a quick hi .

no .
then , no .
what the hell happened to you in china ?
when last we left you , you were in love with , you know .
i know i was .
but there was always this voice inside that kept saying :
&quot; it &apos;s never gonna happen . move on . &quot; you know whose voice that was ?
god ?
it was you , pal .
maybe it was god doing me .
aside from being almighty , he &apos;s a wiz at doing voices .
you were right . she looks at me and sees a friend . that &apos;s all .
and then i met julie ...

go , go , go ! come on , come on !
so what did you find out ?
he said ....
he said ....
they &apos;re having a great time .
i &apos;m sorry .
but the silver lining , if you wanna see it ...
... is that he made this decision all by himself ...
... without any outside help whatsoever .
how is that a silver lining ?
you have to really wanna see it .
ironically , these guys were picked last in gym .
hey , pheebs .
you know what i &apos;m thinking ?
how ...
... it &apos;s been so long since you &apos;ve had sex ...
... you &apos;re wondering if they &apos;ve changed it ?
not even close ?
no . although now that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
so what were you thinking ?
you gave the guys great haircuts . i thought you &apos;d like to do mine .
no .
why not ?
because i &apos;m just ....
i &apos;m incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak .
no , you &apos;re not .
i know i &apos;m not , but you are .
i was trying to spare your feelings .
hold on .

paolo , now you &apos;ve seen everybody and they &apos;ve all seen you .
how did this happen ?
i kind of ran into him last night .

and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe ?
oh , god , i know . i &apos;m pathetic , i &apos;m a loser .
honey , you &apos;re not pathetic . you &apos;re just sad .
people do stupid things when they &apos;re upset .
my god , if i had a nickel for every guy i wish i hadn &apos;t

yeah , he &apos;s back . is that a problem ?
no , not a problem .
good . glad it &apos;s not a problem .
you &apos;re gonna have to not touch my ass .
despite the yummy bagels and palpable tension ...
... my pants need to be altered .
when you see frankie , tell him joey tribbiani says hello .
he &apos;ll know what it means .
you sure he &apos;ll crack that code ?
it &apos;s funny . the last time paolo was here , my hair was so much cuter .
all right .
but you have to promise that you will not be all controlly and bossy ...
... and all monica about it .
i promise .
all right , let &apos;s see .
now , some of you are gonna get cut and some of you aren &apos;t .
but i promise , none of you will feel a thing .
that &apos;s it . i quit .
what ? i didn &apos;t say anything !
but this isn &apos;t the face of a person who trusts a person .
this is the face of a person who , you know ...
... doesn &apos;t trust a person .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just a little shorter than what we had discussed .
would you relax ? i know what i am doing .
this is how he wears it .
how who wears it ?
demi moore .
demi moore is not a &quot; he . &quot;
well , he was a &quot; he &quot; in arthur and in 10 .
that &apos;s dudley moore !
i said i wanted it like demi moore !
oh , my god !
oh , god !
oh , my god ! i &apos;m sorry !
which one is demi moore ?
she &apos;s the actress that was in disclosure , indecent proposal , ghost !
she &apos;s got gorgeous hair .
i know !
that &apos;s why i wanted to look like her .
you know , my mom &apos; s d ead .
oh , my god .
well , this is what my butt must look like to a fly .
how long do you want the cuffs ?
at least as long as i have the pants .
i just got that .
now we &apos;ll do your inseam .
how is she ?
it &apos;s too soon to tell .
she &apos;s resting , which is a good sign .
how &apos;s the hair ?
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you . it doesn &apos;t look good .
there &apos;s nothing you can do ?
at this point , it &apos;s a waiting game .
i put a clip on one side , which seems to have stopped the curling .
can we see her ?
your hair looks too good . it &apos;d upset her .
ross , you come on in .
well , how you doing ?
i &apos;m okay .
that bad , huh ?
look , i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable .
it &apos;s one of my gifts .
joey , when i saw him get off that plane with her ...
... i really thought i just hit rock bottom .
but today , it &apos;s like there &apos;s rock bottom ...
... 50 feet of crap ...
... then me .
tell ross how you feel .
come on , how can i just tell him ? what about julie ?
what about her ? they &apos;ve only been going out for two weeks .
ross has been in love with you for 10 years .
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve been with my share of women .
i &apos;ve been with a lot of people &apos;s share of women .
but the point is ...
... i &apos;ve never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you .
really ?
yo , paesano !
can i talk to you for a sec ?
your tailor ...
... is a very bad man !
what are you talking about ?
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
joey &apos;s tailor ...
... took advantage of me .
what ?
no way ! i &apos;ve been going to the guy for 1.2 years .
he said he was gonna do my inseam .
then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite
what ?
cupping .
that &apos;s how they do pants !
first they go up one side , they move it over .
then they go up the other side , move it back , then they do the rear .
ross , tell him . isn &apos;t that how a tailor measures pants ?
yes , yes , it is . in prison !
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
what ?
that &apos;s not ?
oh , my god !
i &apos; ll put on a pot of coffee .
even mary tyler moore would &apos;ve been better .
come on . it &apos; s not that bad.you never know .
bell - bottoms came back .
i like it .
i do . i think it &apos;s a 10 !
thank you .
my hair is very amused .
come on , things could be worse .
you could &quot; get caught between the moon and new york city .
i know it &apos;s crazy , but it &apos;s true . &quot;
thank you .
well , i gotta go . bye .
bye , rach !
wait , are you leaving ?
that &apos;s what i meant by &quot; bye . &quot;
can i talk to you for a sec ?
when the doctor does that hernia test ....
that &apos;s okay .
if your mechanic does it ....
what &apos;s going on ?
well , okay , first of all ...
... paolo and i are not back together .
that was a stupid thing i did .
if i could go back in time and do it again ...
... well , i wouldn &apos;t .
second of all ....
what ?
is this one of those things where you break up with a guy ...
... i tell you what i think ...
... and the next day you get back together with him ...
... and i look like a complete idiot ?
well , then , i think the guy &apos;s scum .
i hate him . i mean , i actually i physically hate him .
i always have .
and you are way too good to be with a guy like that .
really ?
you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you ...
... and who gets how funny ...
... and sweet and amazing ...
... and adorable and sexy you are .
you know ? someone who wakes up every morning thinking :
&quot; oh , my god . i &apos;m with rachel ! &quot;
you know ? someone who makes you feel good .
like the way i do with julie .
was there a &quot; second of all &quot; ?
no , i think that was the whole &quot; all . &quot;
i gotta go .
thanks .
no , i swear to god , dad !
that &apos;s not how they measure pants !
i was thinking of doing it shorter , like andie macdowell &apos;s haircut .
yeah , i could do that .
really ?
you wanna do it now ?
great !
see you .
i just wanna make really sure this time .
andie macdowell is the girl from four weddings and a funeral , right ?
no .
that &apos;s roddy mcdowall .
andie macdowell is the guy from planet of the apes .
