i told you , you didn &apos;t have to come .
yeah , let you drive yourself when you look this bad ?
yeah ?
he &apos;s out .
he looks good .
talk to him . get a sense .
okay .
your cousin &apos;s out of rehab . looks good .
okay , i &apos;m sorry about that .
inconclusive .
score one for the italians . you don &apos;t have lupus .
thank god for that .
think we might be looking at a viral syndrome ...
maybe mono .
oh , god .
how &apos;s your emotional level ?
stress off the charts lately ? like all of us ?
what do you mean ?
death , major change of any kind ?
no , just the usual . one day runs into the next .
stay on the advil . your temperature goes up , you call me .
i got a relative who &apos;s got a heroin problem .
the people that need drugs , all they can get is shit like advil .
thank you for coming .
that was grove street .
i gotta make a stop down in sea bright .
i don &apos;t feel well .
you get some sea air . we &apos;ll go to barr &apos;s .
you won &apos;t have to cook .
goddamn it . yeah , i really want lobster .
the student loan people called .
we &apos;re late with allegra &apos;s nursing school payment .
where you going ?
nordstrom &apos;s . they &apos;re having a sale .
sallie mae calls , and your response to that is to go shopping ?
it &apos;s a sale , john . i need clothes for italy .
we &apos;re still going , aren &apos;t we ?
might be time for a little belt @-@ tightening .
the bottom line is i &apos;ll be losing money if the esplanade is shut down .
we should try to go . i spoke to nicole lupertazzi .
when she and little carmine stayed at the hassler last year , he loved it .
that &apos;s good for little carmine , then .
his fucking wallet isn &apos;t tied to the goddamned esplanade , god damn it !
john , why are you yelling at me ?
john , what &apos;d i do ?
is that my father &apos;s truck ?
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
me to know , you to find out .
so , what do you think , mel ? don &apos;t see no dry rot .
mrs. soprano , virginia lupo , reimax community realty .
hi .
tony ?
that &apos;s right . it &apos;s even got a name .
where did this come from ?
that &apos;s if we can get it .
this is a huge amount of money .
and your construction project shut down ...
that can &apos;t last forever . it &apos;s for the family .
as the kids get older , it gets harder to keep us all together ...
bring friends down , have big cookouts , jet ski .
and for us , too , though . when we were piss poor ...
this was the biggest caviar wish we could come up with .
kind of reminds you of the kennedy compound , don &apos;t it ?
can i ask you why they &apos;re selling ? my husband said , &quot; if we can get it . &quot;
well , there is a buyer already . in fact , the house is sold .
but there &apos;s a chance that these buyers won &apos;t qualify for financing .
and i know the owner , alan .
he lives just next door , here . he &apos;s an attorney .
if you &apos;re offering cash , i thought you should at least see the place .
so , it &apos;s not really for sale .
it &apos;s just as well , because we couldn &apos;t swing this .
there &apos;s al !
the jury has claimed they are deadlocked .
however , i &apos;m inclined to agree with prosecution .
i &apos;m going to give them additional time to reach a verdict .
we should &apos;ve had a hung jury mistrial . object , for christ &apos;s sake !
allen charge . it has to play out .
ladies and gentlemen , you &apos;ve communicated that you feel ...
that you &apos;re unable to come to a unanimous verdict in this case .
now , i know that you &apos;ve been at it for a while , and it can be frustrating .
but we &apos;ve all spent a lot of time on this trial .
and being as i have no reason to believe that another jury ...
with the same evidence would be better able to reach a verdict ...
i &apos;m going to ask you to go back in there and reason with each other ...
and apply the law ... and come back in here with a verdict .
if not , i wanna move on .
here .
did somebody check the order , make sure we got everything this time ?
yes .
well , keep me posted .
dinner &apos;s served !
get any sleep ?
couldn &apos;t .
we have absolutely no business getting into something like that house ...
with a.j. two years away from college .
that was virginia lupo on the phone . she hasn &apos;t heard from the owner .
i guess that deal &apos;s gonna go through .
i wonder who they are .
motherfucking , goddamn orange @-@ peel beef !
call them up . you got me plain soup , right ?
we &apos;ll be finished eating the rest before he gets back .
go through the order while they &apos;re still here .
what good does that do ? he &apos;s still gotta get it and come back again .
what happened ?
they left out part of the order .
call them up .
sit down and eat .
i guess some things just weren &apos;t meant to be .
what are we talking about ?
i was thinking of buying your mother a house down on the shore .
un @-@ fucking @-@ believable !
would we have a gym ?
it &apos;s the shore . wouldn &apos;t you want to be outdoors ?
forget that . you &apos;re fined $ 3 for the f @-@ word .
i heard dad say &quot; mother @-@ f &quot; when i was coming down the stairs .
he &apos;s fined , too . we &apos;re gonna make this policy work .
it &apos;s too late .
what &apos;s going on ?
you know , it does seem like a good value , even at that price .
waterfront property , in that area .
we probably wouldn &apos;t get hurt , as an investment .
you &apos;re the one that took real estate classes .
didn &apos;t you say that a person shouldn &apos;t look at a house as an investment ?
i know you . if you don &apos;t get the place ,
you &apos;ll sulk . and i &apos;ll be the wet blanket .
i &apos;ll sulk ? i was sleeping .
if you want me to sign off ...
we probably wouldn &apos;t lose money .
but if you don &apos;t want to go through with it , believe me , that &apos;s fine , too .
but if you did , virginia lupo &apos;s phone number is on the bureau .
and , you know ... better to act quickly if , you know ...
more is lost by indecision than by wrong decision , that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
hey , jack lemmon . how &apos;s lee remick ?
tony
so , how the fuck are you ?
that place help you ?
yeah .
i found out about strengths i have i didn &apos;t even know i had .
you look fucking great .
thank you .
thank everybody for forcing me to deal with it .
especially adriana .
you &apos;re not shooting junk , right ?
fuck , no . i &apos;m completely clean and sober .
which one of the 12 steps you on now ?
the only one i haven &apos;t done is go around to all the people i fucked over ...
while i was using , and apologize .
maybe you shouldn &apos;t do that one .
you know , let sleeping dogs lie .
that &apos;s what i was thinking .
maybe in a couple of cases , i &apos;ll send flowers , or cash in some cases .
where &apos;s carmine at ?
no change whatsoever .
where are you at ?
i think a movement from below is not palatable to the other bosses .
it &apos;s what they fear most .
a movement from outside , it &apos;s more forgivable ...
and more understandable , given the facts , here .
i mean , you &apos;ve been reasonable .
if i do it , what do you do for me ?
i take a sad song and make it better ... with the other families , as regards you .
you &apos;re smart to have reservations ...
but there &apos;s differences between this and castellano .
yes , you still got the four other families who could raise a stink ...
but andy &apos;s my brother @-@ in @-@ law . i have their ear .
i &apos;m gonna pass .
fuck are you talking about ?
i &apos;m taking the risk .
fuck what were you talking about last time then ?
what would it take ?
fuck even one percentage point .
all claims to my hud business are irrigated .
all right .
all future construction projects , 60 @-@ 40 in my favor .
what i &apos;m gonna tell you is for your ears only , and sil &apos;s .
we &apos;re gonna take out carmine lupertazzi .
johnny sack &apos;s gonna go to war .
no , he &apos;s not .
that &apos;s right . see , carmine &apos;s got major income besides construction ,
johnny don &apos;t .
only other person hurting worse than either of the pricks is me .
whacking the boss of one of the five families ?
johnny &apos;s a snaky fuck .
that &apos;s something to be considered .
but remember , also , how deeply hurt fucking johnny felt over carmine ...
not backing him on those slurs against ginny .
life &apos;s funny .
carmine never made that right with john .
i knew back then that was a mistake .
gonna hit carmine soon ?
if i &apos;m gonna buy this house , i need the esplanade scratch .
it shouldn &apos;t look like what it is .
home invasion , carjacking , fucking ingrown toenail ...
i know these black guys from irvington .
that &apos;s the right idea .
it can never get out who whacked the old fuck .
are they trustworthy , these guys ?
yeah .
make sure .
help you ?
hi , how you doing ? i &apos;m tony soprano .
i was here with my wife the other day with virginia lupo .
right . alan sapinsly .
how are you ?
so , what do you think ?
she says those other people are gonna go through with it .
i was gonna go talk to you , frankly , after i took another look at the place .
this is galling because i don &apos;t think they &apos;re going to qualify for financing ...
and we gave them this god @-@ awful 90 @-@ day escrow . my wife &apos;s doing .
she liked mrs. kim .
i can do 15 days . shortest allowable by law .
never tire of painting this .
you &apos;d be coming in with cash , right ?
yeah .
fuck this .
dr. kim , hey , alan sapinsly .
it &apos;s not ? well , we &apos;ve got serious problems .
on the house . sure .
he &apos;s going into surgery , doesn &apos;t want to talk there in the prep room .
yes , i &apos;m here . what does your lender say ?
jesus , doctor . i take almost no comfort from those words .
and were i you , i wouldn &apos;t either .
i &apos;m aware we have a contract in place .
doctor , please , i &apos;m an attorney . look , cho @-@ sun .
wait , you &apos;re not listening .
simply stated , i want the chance to sell to a more qualified buyer ...
if i can find one at this late date .
actually , it &apos;s very ...
wait , do you want to do all the talking and i &apos;ll just stand here ?
thank you .
you call virginia lupo , she calls the bank , you get your deposit back .
your wife &apos;s a grown woman , she &apos;ll adjust .
dr. kim , i spent 10 years as a litigator .
buy this property ,
i &apos;ll make your life a misery . i can tort you into the poorhouse .
i &apos;ve got an overseas call .
think it over . you have virginia &apos;s number .
who knows ? we &apos;ll see .
i wouldn &apos;t want to be the patient
he &apos;s gonna operate on . -let &apos;s hold a good thought ?
hello .
virginia , sure , hi .
we did ?
all right .
picture the fishing off that dock .
god , it really is beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
first time i felt good signing papers .
dad , blue crabs !
oh , my god , this is nice .
you &apos;ll inherit this .
dad , what a thing to say .
anthony soprano ... you are full of surprises .
it &apos;s good to see a smile on your face .
praise the lord for sobriety .
the higher power .
that 12 @-@ step shit doing for you ?
yeah . thanks for asking .
we sold you &quot; h &quot; when that was your thing .
still we here when it &apos;s wop @-@ whacking time in brooklyn .
it should look like a carjacking .
see ? that &apos;s why you came to us .
that &apos;s some stereotyping shit .
he goes mall @-@ walking inside king &apos;s plaza .
7 : 00 a.m. tuesdays and thursdays . regular .
macy &apos;s entrance , avenue u and flatbush .
you get the down payment ?
next sound you hear ...
home of the burger , what &apos;s your beef ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i have wrong number .
this is the soprano residence .
tony ?
no , this is anthony .
yes . the handsome boy .
who is this ?
is your mother there ?
ma , telephone !
who is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
hello
is this mrs. soprano ?
yes , it is .
i used to fuck your husband .
a.j. , i &apos;ve got it !
tony loves me , you know .
if it wasn &apos;t for his kids , you &apos;d be out on the street .
what do you want ?
i thought you might want to know
we have some sadness in common .
he has been sleeping with my cousin , svetlana .
that &apos;s right . while she was taking care of his uncle .
you piece of shit .
yes , i &apos;m a piece of shit .
i &apos;m a piece of shit which the world , every morning , strains ...
if you can , imagine where you are on the pecking order .
you call my house again ... you ever speak ... to one of my children again ,
i will track you down , and i will kill you . we have got guns here .
i mean it .
you remember my cousin ?
she was also his mama &apos;s caregiver , with the one leg .
it is so absurd , why would i make it up ?
what the fuck ?
what the fuck are you doing ?
you fucking shitbag !
don &apos;t come up here ! get the fuck out of this house !
what &apos;s the matter ?
carm , what did i do now ?
what did i do ?
what did i do ?
your mother told you what i said to your father about her psoriasis ?
i was just trying to be honest with him .
you have made a fool of me for years with these whores .
now it &apos;s come into our home ?
what are you talking about ?
the russian called .
your son answered the telephone .
oh , jesus .
she &apos;s insane . she &apos;s fucking certifiable .
i told you , you can &apos;t believe nothing she says , whatever it is .
we haven &apos;t seen each other like that . i swear to christ . i told you !
what about her cousin ?
what ?
no .
the nurse who took care of your mother , who i liked ?
who i talked to on the telephone about your mother &apos;s alopecia ...
and her bowel movements ? who you told me came from an agency ?
who i shared vodka with the night your mother died ?
you &apos;ve been fucking her ?
there is not a shred of truth in that .
why &apos;d the cousin make it up ? because she &apos;s jealous ! why you , fuck ...
let go of me !
just get out , tony . don &apos;t even say anything .
i &apos;m not going anywhere , and you know it .
so , let &apos;s just lie down , we &apos;ll calm down ...
get your hands off of me !
don &apos;t you touch me ever again .
where &apos;s a. j ?
so , you &apos;ve had a one @-@ legged one now ? that &apos;s nice .
you &apos;ve had quite a time on my watch .
the pre @-@ school assistant ...
the weightlifter ...
at least i never stole from you .
who stole , tony ? who , me ?
my own wife
$ 40,000 . from the birdfeeder .
the birdfeeder . listen to yourself , you sound demented .
what , you want to hit me , tony ? go ahead .
just go away , please , i can &apos;t stand it anymore .
i didn &apos;t do it .
i found her fingernail , tony !
you saw it that day , on your night table .
i found it , and i put it there . i know you saw it .
that ...
what ? that what ?
nothing .
nothing .
what ?
you know what i don &apos;t understand , tony ?
what does she have that i don &apos;t have ?
i did not carry on an affair with the cousin ...
and i will take a goddamn polygraph to that effect .
i want you to leave this house , tony .
please . i want you to leave me alone .
what about the kids ?
yeah , it &apos;s horrible .
god help them .
open the fucking door , or i &apos;ll kick it in !
she &apos;s not there . probably she hides in brighton beach .
she blames you for ronnie zellman . you beat him with belt .
he felt weak in front of her . she told me he couldn &apos;t perform .
they broke up not so long after .
oh , fuck that !
who told her about us ? not you , please .
it was what &apos;s @-@ her @-@ name , right ? the one who walked in on us .
we had bad argument over fica and federal withholding .
i take from her paycheck .
jesus fucking christ . fica and federal withholding ?
i gotta go home tomorrow , and i gotta tell my kids we &apos;re separating .
it &apos;s going to rip them up .
divorce is very hard for kids .
after this , they don &apos;t trust .
i &apos;m child of divorce .
i shouldn &apos;t have been drinking in the afternoon .
how about a little sympathy here ?
you got ice in your veins ?
i had ice in my veins on your uncle couch ?
most expensive piece of ass i ever had .
right . i know what you are thinking , too .
take care , tony . you &apos;re a strong guy , you &apos;ll be all right .
what &apos;s up ?
so , how &apos;s it going with christopher home ?
good . that place was a godsend .
so , the wedding &apos;s back on ?
we haven &apos;t talked about it .
except ...
except what ?
he says he isn &apos;t sure anymore he &apos;d be a good father ...
after killing my dog .
you have kids ?
so , how &apos;s tony ? he &apos;s been house @-@ hunting down the shore ?
beautiful place , too .
what about ralph ?
cifaretto ? heard anything there ?
chrissy says he has a pretty serious drug problem , too .
he may have hit bottom somewhere .
chrissy says he wants to ...
you know , help get him in recovery when he resurfaces .
you know ralph &apos;s second @-@ in @-@ command , vito ?
yeah , the fat guy .
when christopher was away , i had that asshole calling me every five minutes ...
to see if i &quot; needed anything . &quot;
no ! does christopher know ?
you kidding me ? he &apos;d kill him .
not really , i mean ...
you know , he &apos;d be angry .
i &apos;m supposed to meet my mom .
go ahead .
thank you .
i saw your car . que pasa ?
things aren &apos;t very good at home ... so i came down to sleep on my boat .
and it was being refinished , and the smell of the paint drove me out .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ve been up to bat three times .
yeah , i think she &apos;s
thinking of separating .
what you wanna do , go around and meet perfunctorily ...
with all the top divorce attorneys in your area .
that way , if the worst happens , they can &apos;t take her on as a client .
conflict of interest .
that &apos;s pretty good .
just do it , fella .
but you must find a hotel until you officially take possession .
something happens to you , i &apos;m liable .
let me just clean up a little .
hi , i &apos;m tony .
i know who you are . come in , please .
tony
what &apos;s up ?
you know that thing we were talking about , this thing with me and my wife ?
alan just told me .
the thing is , in light of it , i was going over it in the shower ...
and i realized that as much as i want this place ...
now is not the time for me to be buying a house .
sorry , i know it &apos;s a big disappointment . you ought to see how i feel .
i want to get my deposit back , and i &apos;ll get out of your life .
it &apos;s just not that clear to me how your marital
situation ... negates the purchase .
i mean , most of this was for my kids . for my wife .
that is so sad .
excuse me , honey .
we had that place on the market a year and a half .
we had two offers : you and the kims .
so , what about them ?
the kims ?
i can &apos;t go back to them . i guess i could , but i &apos;m not going to .
they &apos;d hold my feet to the fire .
i don &apos;t want to be insensitive with what you got on your plate ...
but we had a signed contract .
alan .
no ! baloney ! i dumped a buyer
&apos;cause they seemed to love the place .
it was the cash and the short escrow .
look , who knows what &apos;s going to happen ?
you guys could be back together in a month ...
leaving a.s. , here , fucked in the ass .
whatever .
what &apos;s the big deal ? why don &apos;t you just let me out of this thing ?
i can &apos;t , i have partners .
excuse me .
i got to take this . it was very nice to meet you .
but i &apos;m not buying your house .
that guy &apos;s a mobster .
they buy houses from people , they conduct business .
i dealt with them on that neapolitan copyright thing for enya .
i &apos;ll probably let him walk ... but that &apos;s a negotiation , which he knows full well .
you don &apos;t have any partners .
thank you , rabbi .
i just talked to carmine . he &apos;s ready to settle .
are you kidding me ? everything &apos;s in motion .
welcome to my world .
i &apos;m sorry to learn about the marital situation , tony .
our thing is more than a livelihood .
one of us suffers a personal tragedy , falls ill and whatnot ...
we all feel it deeply ...
no matter what kind of acrimony is in the air .
what &apos;s in the air is you &apos;re losing a lot of money .
we all agree we want to get back to earning ...
but i reiterate again ...
zellman had a hand in hud , so i can &apos;t , as a matter of principle ...
relinquish my claim .
so ?
i said 40
you said 5.5 , which was ridiculous .
let &apos;s split the difference .
20 percent .
all right , 15 .
you know what ?
in the interest of putting this shit to bed ...
if that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to take ...
15 .
good .
my son was a big help in all this . i want you always to remember that ...
even after i &apos;m gone .
but i &apos;m not going no place .
healthy as a fucking rhino , this guy .
you stay that way .
did you get any sleep ?
a little , i think .
maybe it would be better if you went back to school .
got your head into your schoolwork . be with your friends .
i &apos;d just be thinking about what &apos;s going on here all the time .
i just keep thinking ...
i used to feel so superior ... because so many of my friends
had these fucked @-@ up , divorced parents .
i guess i did , too .
and , like , finn ...
i &apos;m not saying i want kids , but if we did ...
i used to imagine ...
we &apos;d all be together on the holidays , christmas ... all around this big fire .
you will have a wonderful future , meadow .
we had a lot of wonderful times as a family .
all predicated on bullshit .
i don &apos;t want to fight with you , meadow .
that &apos;s not true . i think you know it .
it was &apos; cause of furio , wasn &apos;t it ?
who said anything about furio ?
i have never been unfaithful to your father .
daddy was .
this is not something i want to talk about . i &apos;m sorry .
not now , not ever .
jesus , how could you eat shit from him for all those years ?
fresh pepper ?
just a little .
about you and carmela ...
i &apos;m sorry .
this is not al dente .
hello ?
fucking amazing , huh ?
well , i guess that &apos;s that .
things have a momentum of their own .
more is lost by indecision than wrong decision .
that &apos;s a good point .
okay , then . you &apos;ll hear from me .
that was j.s.
we &apos;re not on for tuesday no more , right ?
wrong .
johnny sack .
i always worked very fucking hard to make him think i liked him .
i &apos;d try to feel him out about shit .
i think he and ralphie were in bed in some way .
it went bad with that joke shit .
we reached an agreement .
when tony gave him his final number , carmine &apos;s depends blew out .
oh , my fucking back !
that cot at the pork store , not really good for sleeping , t.
with all due love and respect to carmela ...
i &apos;d put her shit out on the curb and let it rain on her .
you can &apos;t disrupt the kids .
that shit traumatizes them for life .
it &apos;s his house as much as it is hers .
more . i paid for it .
that &apos;s right , t , i &apos;m on your side on this .
she &apos;s the one who talked me into buying it in the first place .
now i &apos;m out in the streets ?
these fucking phones .
we were better off years ago .
what ?
i hadn &apos;t heard from you .
my partners and i have decided to let you out of your obligation .
i want my $ 200,000 by the end of the week .
as to that , i &apos;m not rescinding the deposit .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re for , to hold parties to agreements .
if you want to make me an offer ...
no , i think i &apos;ll buy the house .
my family has parties till 4 : 00 , 5 : 00 in the morning .
i can show damages . i &apos;m being generous
in not bringing action to enforce the sale .
damages ? they haven &apos;t started yet .
listen to me . there &apos;s a paper trail to our dispute ,
and virginia lupo &apos;s a witness .
a hair on my head gets mussed , the authorities will know where to look .
alan , you misread me entirely .
you must think i &apos;m a fucking thug .
just be forewarned .
you &apos;re not getting your deposit back !
jesus , you scared me to death .
this is my house , carmela , and i &apos;m not leaving .
get out of here , tony . i asked you once , nicely .
all right , look .
i know what happened was wrong . i was an asshole
and i apologize.i &apos;m sorry . it won &apos;t happen again .
i said , &quot; get out . &quot;
make me .
i have an appointment with a lawyer , tony . i will get a restraining order .
a lawyer ? go ahead .
you know what ? call him . here , use my phone .
fine , stay .
come here .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
let go of me . your son will be home .
you want him to see you like this ?
you &apos;d love that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m not leaving here .
i don &apos;t love you anymore !
i don &apos;t want you ! you are not sleeping in my bed , tony !
the thought of it now makes me sick !
jesus christ almighty , i &apos;m going fucking crazy !
think mom &apos;s going to let you stay out here ?
let ? this is my house .
ain &apos;t it better when i &apos;m here ?
well , sure .
come on .
we &apos;ll bring them down to the garage tomorrow .
what time is it ?
you just getting home ?
we were studying .
oh , yeah ? from now on , i &apos;m going to take a bigger hand in this shit .
i &apos;m going to be right out here . i want you to be respectful to your mother .
she &apos;s having a hard time .
did she say something ?
i &apos;m just saying .
all right . go to bed . it &apos;s a school night .
the audiences have been given an abundance of programming ...
and they vote every hour , every minute , every five minutes ...
with their remotes .
thanks , by the way , for drinking wine in front of me .
hello ?
call it off .
the old guy .
yeah ?
something don &apos;t make sense here .
you think it &apos;s a setup ?
not necessarily , but ...
our friend is very anxious to pass the ball , the prick .
but nobody can know this was ever considered .
i &apos;ll offer my guys half of what they &apos;d have got . that should do it .
i just want you to make sure . i told you that .
it &apos;s all there .
if you get the taste to chip a little &quot; h &quot; again ...
don &apos;t forget to call us .
like we said , you &apos;ll keep this quiet .
i got the mouth on a statue , nigga .
word .
see you around .
he ain &apos;t quit . he &apos;s just freshening up .
don &apos;t say jack shit to kaesha about this ...
or she be haunting my ass for that child support ...
what ?
i was wondering when you would move those theater seats down to the garage .
seriously ? that &apos;s what you came out here to talk to me about ?
they are on the lawn . they &apos;ll ruin the grass .
bad for the grass !
i can &apos;t put the sprinklers on over there without the seats getting wet .
they &apos;re your seats . i don &apos;t want to wreck them .
i &apos;ll get right on it .
why do you have to make even this little thing so difficult ?
what possible reason could you have for coming here ...
to talk to me about theater seats except to bust my balls ?
i wanted to water while i was out .
yeah , right .
fuck you .
it &apos;s going to cost you $ 3 .
you know what , tony ? what &apos;s done is done .
we are where we are , and it &apos;s for the best .
but just for the record , or it might even interest you to know ...
that i might actually have gone on with your cheating and your bullshit ...
if your attitude around here had been even the least bit loving ...
cooperative , interested .
whose idea was whitecaps ?
it is just a bigger version of an emerald ring
so you can keep on with your other life .
you don &apos;t know me at all .
i know you better than anybody , tony . even your friends .
which is probably why you hate me .
hate you ?
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m going to hell when i die .
nice thing to say to a person heading into an mri .
you know , tony ...
i have always been sorry i said that .
you were my guy .
you could be so sweet . nobody could make me laugh like you .
who the fuck did you think i was when you married me ?
you knew my father . you grew up around dickie moltisanti and your uncle eddie .
where do you get off acting surprised and miffed ...
when there are women on the side ?
you knew the deal .
deal ?
your mom talks all she wants ...
about what &apos;s @-@ his @-@ name and his chain of drugstores .
both of us know the other boyfriend you were debating marrying ...
was jerry tufi , with his father &apos;s snowplow business .
and we now know that that wouldn &apos;t have suited you at all .
you really don &apos;t hear me , do you ?
you think , for me , it &apos;s all about things .
no , i forced all this shit on you .
what you really crave is a little hyundai and a simple gold heart on a chain .
you are so fucking hateful .
can i tell you something , tony ?
don &apos;t pretend like i got a choice .
the last year ... i have been dreaming
and fantasizing , and in love with furio .
every morning , when he &apos;d come to pick you up ...
i would look forward to it all night long , in bed ...
next to you . those nights when you were actually in the bed .
and he would ring the doorbell ...
i felt like my heart would come out of my chest .
he would smile , and we &apos;d talk . and then you would come down the stairs .
and i felt probably like someone who is terminally ill ...
and , somehow , they manage to forget it for a minute .
and then it all comes back .
he &apos;d talk to you ! poor you !
he made me feel like i mattered !
you asked me the other day what irina &apos;s cousin has that you don &apos;t have .
and i thought about it , because it is a pretty good question .
she is sexy , even with the one pin gone , but that &apos;s not it .
i could converse with her , because she had something to say !
i am here ! i have things to say !
besides &quot; bring the chairs down , &quot; and &quot; did you sign the living trust ? &quot;
she is a grown woman who has been kicked around ...
and she &apos;s been on her own , and has had to fight and struggle .
unlike me , is that it ? who the fuck wanted it like this ?
who the fuck pissed and moaned at just the idea ...
of me with a real estate license ?
free to sit back for 20 fucking years and fiddle with the air conditioning ...
and fucking bitch and complain to me !
to your priest !
fuck it !
who knew , all this time , you wanted tracy and hepburn ?
what about the thousand other pigs you had your dick in over the years ?
the strippers , the cocktail waitresses .
were you best friends with all of them , too ?
you fucking hypocrite .
the judge is calling you all into the courtroom .
okay , thanks .
the number you are calling was blocked ...
and cannot be called back using your last @-@ call @-@ return service .
&quot; we are still hopelessly deadlocked .
&quot; one juror refuses to deliberate , and can &apos;t be reasoned with .
&quot; what should we do now ? &quot;
your honor ,
again , i must move for a mistrial .
your honor , the government asks that you give them another allen charge ...
to go back and try again .
as much as i &apos;d like to , this jury &apos;s been at it a long time .
i don &apos;t see where one or two more days is going to change anything .
bring in the jury .
ladies and gentlemen of the jury ,
i see that you are hopelessly deadlocked ...
and i have no choice but to declare a mistrial .
i know that you did the best you could .
you have performed a valuable service . you may be excused .
stay in touch .
call me when your grandson is born .
i wouldn &apos;t want to think of you on that day .
dad .
battle of tarawa . marines had no air cover .
it was a slaughter .
war ? i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s coke in there .
can i move in here ?
what &apos;s wrong with your room ?
i can &apos;t take it anymore .
mom &apos;s just on my case all the time . my dinner got cold .
so , i was on the phone with devin . we had to do an algebra problem .
look , i told you she &apos;s having a hard time right now .
she goes to a lot of trouble to cook meals .
i didn &apos;t ask her to .
and it &apos;s not fair . why do i have to get stuck with her ?
don &apos;t talk about your mother like that .
you don &apos;t have to put up with her shit anymore .
i heard you tell her off out by the pool .
you &apos;re not staying in here .
get that out of your head right now .
why not ?
it would hurt her feelings that you don &apos;t want to be in her part of the house .
your old amp &apos;s hooked back up .
be careful with that speaker . you banged the other one .
what are you gonna do without your front speakers ? i &apos;ll take them .
they &apos;re just borrowing them .
i &apos;ll come back for the amp .
you can come here and watch tv with me , but you can &apos;t stay here .
fuck .
go buy her one of those cds she likes , and some flowers .
tell her you &apos;re sorry , that you &apos;ll try to be more considerate .
we should call everybody , have a big party .
call volpe &apos;s and have them send over a couple of pies , but that &apos;s it .
there &apos;s a hearty burgundy still in the fridge .
i don &apos;t suppose tony would come ...
with what &apos;s going on up at that abattoir .
i don &apos;t think so , uncle jun &apos; .
i want to get one large cheese and tomato , and then one with alici .
yeah , it &apos;s me .
i got you , babe
go down by the cellar door . see if murf left the envelope under the flagstone .
he wouldn &apos;t have been around today .
i &apos;ll go look later .
do it now . is that asking so much ?
i just went through the trial of my life .
to wonderful friends ... to alan &apos;s shark fin soup ... and to a wonderful day .
hear , hear .
cheers .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , the sands hotel proudly presents ...
the star of our show ... direct from the bar , dean martin !
what the hell ?
it &apos;s that boat .
&quot; stugots &quot; ? fucking goombah trash .
this whole shoreline &apos;s turning into the gulf of sorrento .
buddy ! turn it down !
been waiting long ?
sorry , i was interviewing divorce lawyers .
that &apos;s why i always ask myself , &quot; is it worth it financially ? &quot;
you and ginny are the old married couple .
marriage can be very hard work if both aren &apos;t pulling that load .
i was wondering , why the delay ?
i was gonna call you .
you &apos;re not gonna be happy .
i &apos;m out .
whacking a boss is bad for business .
and now that he &apos;s settled ...
we can weather it .
it &apos;s not just the internal upheaval .
mr. and mrs. john q. america , by and large , they sit still for our shit .
so , people get ripped off , they figure it &apos;s not them .
but if it &apos;s the fucking o.k. corral out there ... the feds take heat .
this is very disappointing .
i know .
but he &apos;s an old man . you &apos;re gonna get your chance soon enough .
don &apos;t go into coaching , tony . it &apos;s not your long suit .
what i was gonna say ...
tomorrow , i go in to work .
&quot; creeps on this petty pace . &quot; and i take orders from him again ?
or that disgusting , fucking , cocksucker idiot son of his ?
i shouldn &apos;t be hearing that .
really ?
what i was gonna say was ...
it &apos;s a major step ...
but if you wanna do it , without me as a partner ...
you do what you gotta do .
i will never , ever reveal any conversation we ever had .
the thing is , we had those conversations .
your mouth was moving along with mine .
we just go back about our business at the esplanade , like it never happened ?
that would be the healthy choice .
healthy for who ?
why the fuck would i ever trust somebody
who &apos;d leave me holding my cock like this ?
i shouldn &apos;t have heard that either .
there you go .
there &apos;s the fucking problem .
i still consider you a dear friend .
they &apos;re actually moored about two and a half centimeters away from the fire .
so , they are finally making a little bit of an impact with their buckets .
i didn &apos;t know you were in the house .
just stopped by to pick up a few things .
fine .
the geeks are really making some progress now !
turn that off and come here .
got something to say to your mom . i might as well tell you at the same time .
it &apos;s almost over .
now .
i &apos;ve been thinking about things , me living out there .
i &apos;ve decided it &apos;s probably not a good idea .
what &apos;s going on ?
i was just telling everybody ...
it &apos;s probably better if i don &apos;t live here anymore .
because i wanted to stay in there with you ? i won &apos;t ask .
i just got pissed off .
he asked to live with you ?
no , a.j.
come here .
that &apos;s not why .
where are you gonna go ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
you should go back to counseling .
it &apos;s better this way .
he &apos;s making the right decision . he &apos;ll get a place , you will go and visit .
it &apos;ll be better , you &apos;ll see .
you guys could still get back together maybe .
right ?
yeah , sure .
we &apos;re still close .
god , is there nothing to eat in this house ?
be careful .
i &apos;ll be at the plaza .
well , i don &apos;t drink anymore . i freeze it now and i eat it like a popsicle .
a drink never hurt nobody . you remember the great words of joe e. lewis .
he says , &quot; you &apos;re not drunk if you can lay on the floor without holding on . &quot;
fucking gangster asshole !
i &apos;ll call the police .
he &apos;ll just turn it down again when the police boat comes .
the coast guard .
he can keep paying those $ 200 fines forever , alan !
you &apos;ve gotta let it go , alan !
