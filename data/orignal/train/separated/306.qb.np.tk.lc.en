i called this staff meeting because lately ,
i &apos;ve noticed our diner family is drifting apart .
good work , everybody . good work .
let &apos;s start off this powwow
by sharing our highs and lows of the week .
my high was getting a particularly interesting snapple fact .
都印有各式各样的冷知识
and my low was--
your entire body ?
i &apos;ll go .
my high was finding a barrette in the bathroom ,
and my low was imagining my new life without it .
max , your high ?
i certainly am .
and my low will be when it wears off .
well , my high was catching a glimpse
of a customer &apos;s lacy g @-@ string ,
and my low was seeing his junk .
my low is this meeting .
and my high is when it wraps up .
can everybody take this serious--
i have a new low .
i have a new high .
me too .
everybody , please .
han just clearly injured his vagina .
that &apos;s not my phone .
my ringtone is let it go , and you know that
&apos;cause you threaten to beat me every time it rings .
well , it &apos;s not mine .
i keep my phone on vibrate
out of respect for those around me ,
and also for little orgasms .
max , it &apos;s the landline .
oh , god ! why is it ringing ?
you said that phone only rings if we &apos;re in trouble
or if it &apos;s you calling from the future
to tell us we &apos;re in trouble .
ruh @-@ roh .
that &apos;s gotta be the landlord . the lease is up .
fine , we &apos;ll just renew it , even though i thought
they would have condemned this place by now .
i mean , i did find a used condom in the hallway yesterday .
hello ?
no !
hang up . we &apos;re not on the lease .
ごめんなさい 今ちょっと話せないの
good cover . now we just have to hope
the original tenant is a benihana chef .
okay .
we don &apos;t have much time . quick !
grab two things you love .
i @-@ i love nothing in here !
and why are we even trying to keep an apartment
that has grass growing in the bathroom ?
i love our toilet lawn .
it &apos;s gross .
max , look at this place .
our refrigerator door is held on by scotch tape ,
and , i mean , there is black mold in there .
at least the black mold made the other mold
move out of the neighborhood .
come on !
someone from the real estate company
is probably on their way over to make sure
the original tenant still lives here .
all right , let &apos;s ride !
i know a guy that can drop off some fake passports
for us in an airport locker .
well , you know him too . it &apos;s oleg .
pick up that phone already !
sounds like a damn pbs fund @-@ raiser down here .
sophie , it &apos;s the landlord calling .
i just found out we &apos;ve been subletting illegally .
oh , well , i always wondered how you girls
could afford to live in this building .
and i ruled out prostitution once i saw caroline dance .
good news .
i dug around the apartment
and i found the original lease .
also found a copy of my birth certificate .
turns out my father &apos;s name is &quot; mother has no idea &quot;
forget that lease .
i &apos;ve already found a new place for us .
a two @-@ bedroom for $ 1,300 in manhattan .
oh ... manhattan , kansas .
we can &apos;t afford to lose this lease .
as soon as they find out this lester donovan
is no longer living there , the rent will get higher
than justin bieber on a plane with his dad .
拒绝依照机长指示 停止在飞机上抽大麻
so i tracked down this original tenant guy , lester .
he &apos;s still alive .
ugh ! can &apos;t catch a break .
he &apos;s at a rest home in sheepshead bay .
we just have to go there and kidnap him .
we &apos;ll tie some cream of wheat to a pole and lure him out .
first of all , in what world
do we have cream of wheat pole money ?
and secondly , i am not gonna go shake down some old man .
you won &apos;t have to .
he &apos;s probably already shaking .
if you &apos;re looking , i know a place .
you share a twin bed with two other girls .
oh , and there are cameras .
but you &apos;re paid $ 4.99 a minute
and get to meet all the singles in your area .
are you one of the singles in the area ?
technically i &apos;d be your costar .
like it or not , we have to hold on to our apartment .
max is right--there are two things in life you cannot lose .
a rent @-@ controlled apartment and bladder control .
actually , there &apos;s an apartment in my building
that just became available .
stop by tomorrow . you can see it .
this place is $ 1,200 ?
$ 1,250 . it just went up since we been talking .
we can &apos;t fit in here .
i &apos;m not talking about me and you .
i &apos;m talking about me and my boobs .
nice retirement home .
why don &apos;t we just live here ?
bingo tournaments , unlimited hard candy ,
and you get to crap your pants !
lester ?
that must be him .
i don &apos;t know who i am anymore , but that must be him .
hi , mr. donovan .
lester ?
max , is he dead ?
no , he &apos;s alive , but just ...
this is so sad .
look at how we treat our elderly .
wake up !
i @-@ i @-@ i need you to wake up for this !
we are currently subletting your old apartment ,
and we need you to pretend
tou still live there for a day .
or just to pretend you still live .
ladies , you &apos;re wasting your time .
he can &apos;t speak , and he doesn &apos;t like girls .
he &apos;s a vegetable and a fruit .
lester donovan .
oh , you &apos;re lester ! oh , thank god .
listen , lester , we need you--
i know , i know . you want me to pretend
i still live in your apartment . i overheard everything .
we &apos;re not all comatose , darling .
but i &apos;m afraid--ahem-- it &apos;s not gonna happen , girls .
&apos;cause i got a big week .
my special lady is moving in with me .
&apos;cause this guy &apos;s not gonna be around much longer .
18 hours ... tops !
oh ! here &apos;s my princess .
olivia !
he &apos;s still with us . god bless .
so we &apos;ll have to push the move to monday .
yeah ... about that , lester .
i &apos;m not ready to move in with you .
olivia , wh--what do you mean ?
max , we should go .
no way !
this is like watching an elder version of the bachelor !
literally ... the final rose !
lester , it &apos;s not you . it &apos;s me .
that &apos;s still in play at their age ?
i &apos;m just not ready to settle down .
too many other fish in the sea .
i know--it &apos;s about that new kid on the block ,
morty what &apos;s @-@ his @-@ name . it &apos;s about morty , isn &apos;t it ?
lester , please .
i don &apos;t want it to be weird
when we see each other at bingo .
you should know this about morty--
he &apos;s not a real man like me .
his middle name is viagra !
olivia !
well , there &apos;s no point hanging around here .
i &apos;ll just grab my penis pump , and we &apos;re outta here .
进而造成强行勃起
why is he gonna need that ?
here we are , &quot; home , sweet ...
at least it &apos;s not a rest home &quot; &quot;
lester , not that i minded pushing you 35 blocks , but ...
you could walk at the home .
why can &apos;t you walk now ?
i &apos;m too depressed to walk .
i &apos;ve been depressed since i learned to walk .
i mean , i was nine . it was time .
i have just lost the love of my life !
have you ever made love to a lady with no teeth
and two plastic hips ?
i , for one , have not .
max ?
no . but it just rocketed to number one on my bucket list .
i lived here from 1954 to studio 54 .
liza minnelli threw up in that corner .
the only time i ever saw anybody
take three bows after a vomit .
why did you leave ?
you always think you &apos;re gonna find something better .
yep . the toilet grass is always greener .
okay . that &apos;s the building rep , lester .
do we need to go over our cover story again ?
it &apos;s pretty easy .
i &apos;m carlotta spaghetta ...
mild @-@ mannered pet trainer by day ,
hot @-@ tempered nigerian spy by night .
lester , only listen to me .
max is your granddaughter ,
and i &apos;m her sober companion--
which is the only part of our story that &apos;s true .
it &apos;s him--now , just sit and smile and nod .
i &apos;ll nod , but i &apos;m not gonna smile .
welcome to my grandfather &apos;s
happy , happy home . there &apos;s his couch .
there &apos;s his kitchen .
what &apos;s this ?
there &apos;s his bong .
his bong .
glaucoma .
chemo .
well , good afternoon .
i &apos;m roger from building management .
i &apos;m here to verify this lease ,
and i &apos;d like to do it
before the rest of this doorway caves in .
and of course you know my dear ,
dear grandfather lester .
i just have a few questions , mr. donovan .
have you ever made love to a woman with a silicone hip ?
it &apos;s amazing !
okay ! i can cross that one off my list .
hey , girls .
i came through the back
&apos;cause this junkie &apos;s on the front stoop ,
and it &apos;s still a little awkward between us .
oh , uh , this is sophie . she lives upstairs .
as you can see , roger , no problems .
everything &apos;s totally legit .
hey , who &apos;s the old guy ?
she lives upstairs , and she doesn &apos;t know lester ?
she knows him--this is just a sexual game they play
called &quot; who are you ? &quot;
that doesn &apos;t sound like a sexual game .
it is when she &apos;s saying it to his penis .
sophie , this is the guy from the agency
who just came by to verify
that lester actually lives here .
oh , yeah !
he lives here every day !
yeah , and we play that game forever .
who are you ?
come closer . he can &apos;t hear you .
i &apos;m feeling better already .
so the main takeaway here
is that they both live in the building legally .
now , let &apos;s just sign that lease .
mr. donovan , i just need your signature here ,
and this &apos;ll lock you into the lease for another four years .
what &apos;s your hip situation ?
oh , i &apos;m as hip as they come , baby ! yeah !
now , that &apos;s a looker !
here ya go .
yep ! all done .
you have the apartment for another four years .
enjoy it ?
oh , and i &apos;m required to say : traces of cancerous stuff
have been found in some of the apartments .
have a nice day !
four more years ! four more years !
we get to stay in the place
i never thought i &apos;d want to stay in .
oh , lester , you &apos;re up . feeling better ?
like a million bucks .
i feel like my old self again .
oh , hey , it &apos;s been 18 hours .
let &apos;s go see if your friend &apos;s dead .
yeah , lester . let &apos;s get ya home .
what are you talking about ? i am home .
what do you mean ? this is our place .
not according to that lease i just signed .
i &apos;ll be in my bedroom .
good to be home !
ruh @-@ roh ...
ruh @-@ roh .
ladies , this is delicious !
you know , at the home they keep salt on lockdown .
salt and the dementia patients .
well , it doesn &apos;t look like bad grandpa &apos;s leaving tonight .
maybe i can help .
i can put some ground glass in his salisbury steak .
it &apos;s called a ukrainian divorce .
eh ... i &apos;ll try this jell @-@ o first .
yeah , it &apos;s so old , it might kill him .
lester , i brought you some jell @-@ o .
would you like some ?
that &apos;s very nice of you ,
but i &apos;m not going anywhere .
lester , really , you don &apos;t want to live with us .
caroline sings so much
she should have animated birds on her .
look , there &apos;s no way i &apos;m going back to that retirement home .
i feel alive for the first time since ...
since i died briefly last year .
oh , my god , really ?
yes , some nurse tripped over the power cord .
a @-@ and besides , it &apos;s really helping me get over olivia .
i &apos;m finally realizing there are plenty of other fish in the sea .
hey , everybody !
and there &apos;s one of &apos; em .
she puts the &quot; ass &quot; in &quot; bass . &quot;
friend , i &apos;ll be in my booth .
hey , sophie . you remember lester .
lester , you remember when they discovered fire .
please , please , join me .
may i buy you an egg cream ?
oh , i do love an egg cream .
oh , excuse me , i gotta go powder by nose .
girls ...
girls , i know you want your apartment back
and i &apos;m a reasonable man ,
so all i want before i go is a little you @-@ know @-@ what .
more jell @-@ o ?
i &apos;m talking about sex . rebound sex !
rebound sex ?
are you sure you &apos;ll even be able to rebound from having sex ?
are you kidding ?
there &apos;s nothing but sex at that retirement home .
why do you think i put myself there ?
it &apos;s wall @-@ to @-@ wall whoopee ,
and you don &apos;t even have to drive home after .
now , i have in mind a certain elegant lady .
ahh , you &apos;re out of t.p. !
you can set me up for one night with your friend ,
and i will gladly leave the apartment .
i &apos;ll be in your booth .
hey , sophie , you &apos;ll get with that old guy , right ?
are you fricking kidding me ?
lester , she didn &apos;t go for it .
i &apos;m not going back to that retirement home
with my tail between my legs .
i gotta sleep with someone to make olivia jealous .
there &apos;s a new thing that kids are doing called &quot; lying . &quot;
why don &apos;t you just make something up ?
pics or it didn &apos;t happen .
i need a selfie with whoever i hook up with
for my facebook page .
and if it &apos;s not gonna be sophie ,
my guess , it &apos;s gonna be one of you two up in bed ...
slugger .
slugger .
* take me out to the ball game *
* take me out *
now i know why liza threw up .
now i &apos;m depressed .
so you lost the straw pull
for who &apos;s gonna sleep with lester .
look , you &apos;ve been saying you wanted to have sex
and you &apos;ve also been saying you wanna go antiquing .
so , behind that door are both .
and , max , i think you cheated in that straw pull .
of course i cheated !
look , i have had a lot of crazy sex .
i once did it with a clown at a funeral .
but i cannot see that penis pump .
i won &apos;t be able to come back from that .
you think i can ?
i do , i think the science part of your brain would enjoy it .
ladies , i &apos;ve stretched .
i &apos;m ready .
fine , i &apos;ll take the bullet .
i don &apos;t think there are any bullets in that gun .
are you sure ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t wanna have an old baby .
this is ridiculous
that we &apos;re even entertaining the thought
of doing anything with an old man that isn &apos;t a trump .
max , i can &apos;t do this .
one of us will just have to take
that apartment in earl &apos;s building
and you will find another place .
but then we &apos;d have to live apart .
i know , but i don &apos;t see another choice .
i &apos;m not ready to live without you .
i &apos;m not ready to live without you .
what ?
i saw the pump ! pack your things !
max , i can &apos;t believe you were almost willing to do that
to live with me .
you know what , i &apos;m going in .
because the thought of not seeing you
24 hours a day , 7 days a week , would kill me !
we &apos;ll meet every saturday morning for coffee .
less and less over time , of course .
that was a good start . what else you got ?
nothing !
ah , i &apos;m really liking this whole back door thing .
wow , that &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve ever said that .
don &apos;t get used to it , sophie .
you never do .
no , i mean , we &apos;re gonna have to leave this place .
we couldn &apos;t do it with lester .
i know , that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
you don &apos;t have to do this for us .
if you two didn &apos;t live in this building ,
then we &apos;d drift apart
and we &apos;d only see each other on saturdays for coffee .
well ... i &apos;d probably only go once .
look , just give me 90 seconds .
i mean , he &apos;s got a pump . how hard could it be ?
she &apos;s amazing .
we should probably get her something for this .
what would be appropriate ?
that good candle under the sink ?
we &apos;ve only used it once .
that seems right .
i don &apos;t know what that was , but i &apos;m not up to it .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think my heart could take it .
afraid sex with sophie would kill you ?
yeah , that &apos;s why i haven &apos;t gone there .
you know , i was all excited about--about all the--
all the other fish in the sea .
that was a great white shark !
hey , come on !
i just stretched . i &apos;m ready .
look , uh , could we get a quick pic ?
i might &apos;ve gone there , too , if i knew he had an iphone 5s .
try to be as sexy as possible .
oh , okay , yeah .
when olivia sees that , she &apos;s gonna say , &quot; morty who ? &quot;
girls , enjoy your apartment .
i had some lovely times here .
thank you so much , lester .
bye , grandpa .
maybe sometime we could come visit you in the home .
email me . we &apos;ll talk .
that &apos;s still in play at his age ?
hey , thanks for the blue balls , lester !
nighty @-@ night , girls .
max , we get to stay together !
and even better , he left his wheelchair !
push me into the kitchen , i wanna crack open a beer .
i wonder if i &apos;ll be pushing you like this when you &apos;re 70 .
you &apos;ll be pushing me like this when i &apos;m 30 .
there &apos;s no place like home .
i &apos;ll go get the scotch tape .
