Funny thing. You have mud covering both of your --
Green tea with honey, and a redeye, three extra shots.
Thank you.
You're drinking four shots of espresso.
Yeah, 'cause these stupid cups don't hold five.
So I can take that to mean that you're not sleeping?
Almost every time I close my eyes, I see her face.
I know. So do I.
I just can't believe Alice got out of jail.
I mean, we were so close.
How does that make you feel?
Bad.
And mad.
And sad.
Strong feelings.
You care to explore them?
They're pretty simple.
Well, but what's behind them is not.
And you have been through so much.
I mean, look inside. What do you see?
I'm even madder and...
sadder.
Nothing else?
No, I --
I don't know why this woman is obsessed with me.
I talked to her once at the police academy.
I don't know what I've done or what she thinks I've done.
I just -- I don't where she is,
And until I have answers, I just --
This is it.
Bad, sad, mad.
Exactly.
Thanks for understanding.
Okay, I'm gonna go.
Well, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna go find her.
It was nice having coffee with you.
Yeah, good talk.
Four years for possession with intent to distribute.
So Alice Sands is a drug dealer.
That explains where she got all the cash
to be able to screw with my life.
I called Paul O'Connell. From the drug unit.
Yeah, he's the guy that arrested Alice and put her in prison.
He's expecting you.
Okay. Great.
Well, the guard who supervised Alice Sands' release
saw her get into a gold plymouth satellite,
But he didn't get a plate.
They stopped making those in 1975.
Great.
I'll put out a bolo
for the make, model, and color.
He get a look at the driver who picked her up?
No. But we're pulling video that might have caught an image.
Now that Alice Sands is out,
I want to arrange protection, Jane.
No.
No, the last time you did that,
I ended up in an apartment all by myself.
Jane.
What -- you're getting married today.
Can't miss that.
Can I?
Wha-- I --
That's what I thought.
We only caught her because we got lucky.
She was pulled over on a routine traffic stop,
and there was a bag in the trunk with enough cocaine in it
to bring her up on intent to distribute.
But before that,
she's never been on our radar in any way.
Okay, well, what about the rest of her operation?
Well, she didn't give up any information on it.
I mean, we dug around -- looked into possible associates.
We came up with nothing.
So you couldn't shut it down?
No.
If her organization exists, it's deep, deep underground.
Well, there's got to be something.
I mean, a paper trail
or something from another investigation.
I'm sorry, detective. I got to go. I'm on a stakeout.
Good luck finding a drug ring that the drug unit couldn't.
It's hard to believe that's Alice Sands' dad.
Yep.
波士顿警察帮助联调局破获贩卖人口团伙
Supercop.
Damn straight.
Someone should make a movie about him.
No one would believe it. This guy was amazing.
And his brother. His dad, too.
The fantastic three.
Why did Alice break the mold?
Because Marvel had the rights to "Fantastic four?"
Nerd humor. Nice.
So I left four messages for Detective McFadden,
And I finally got one back -- "Leave me alone."
I'll go.
You know him?
No, but I know his language.
You have an address?
I'll text it to you.
Okay.
What'd you find out from O'Connell?
That Alice knew how to keep her drug business completely buried.
We already knew that.
Yeah.
Did you get a list of her visitors while she was in jail?
It's bizarre. She didn't have any.
What?
She was there for four years.
Not one visitor.
This woman leaves no trace of anything behind her.
Jane, we got a hit on the gold Plymouth.
It was involved in a murder in Maine this morning.
The car belongs to a woman named Wendy Allen
who was at MCI Framingham.
The same time as Alice?
Cellmates.
Wendy was in for prostitution and minor drug charges.
Served 11 months. Released two weeks ago.
Here she is in Maine.
Both the shooter and Wendy are still at large.
That's wendy coming out of the store
after the trooper is shot.
Do we have footage of the driver?
No.
So we can't be sure that's Alice Sands.
She shot a cop and left her cellmate behind.
That's her.
Tell the locals we're on our way. Come on, Frankie.
It's her turn to be chased.
Request permission to expand the search area.
Stay with Quadrants A and B.
She's got the river on one side.
We covered the road on the other.
Copy that.
Gun's still holstered,
so he didn't feel like he was in danger.
Single gunshot wound to the chest.
Died instantly.
This wasn't a murder. It was an execution.
I'm sorry. This must be very difficult for you.
We got a good print off the broken wine bottle.
Belongs to Wendy Allen.
Uh, we can have our officer in our bric
send you everything we have.
No, we're good.
Are you sure, because...
Get Ramirez on it.
Trooper, do you have a problem with us being here?
I never have problems on my crime scenes.
There's mud underneath his nails.
Well, yeah, the security video caught him
wiping it off the license plate.
He couldn't read the numbers.
Yeah, because she covered them up.
Well, I'd like to get a sample of this mud.
If we know its origin,
we know where Alice Sands was prior to coming here.
Our M.E.'s on the way from Lewiston.
I'd like him to secure the evidence.
Who I'm sure is excellent, but Dr. Isles is the best.
We'll handle it.
Frederickson, make sure the scene stays fresh.
Okay, did your office tell you our connection this case?
I believe the woman that you're looking for is Alice Sands.
She's an ex-con
who's been targeting me and my family for weeks.
And trooper Juster is like family to me,
So it's personal for all of us.
Great! Then let's work together and --
Officer.
Not long ago, I was abducted.
Chloroformed.
My hands were bound.
He hit me.
Oh, that's awful.
All that was done at the behest of the woman we're chasing,
who most likely killed your friend.
J.D., it's Williams.
Go.
Dogs picked up a scent. Quadrant B, west.
We think it's Wendy Allen.
On my way. Let's go.
Thanks.
Frankie.
Jane.
I'm gonna take the samples back to Boston for analysis.
Okay. I'll see you there.
We need to take her alive.
No guarantees.
Who the hell is it?
Oh, come on.
Oh, no, no, no. I'm through with cops.
McFadden, It's VIince Korsak.
I brought a friend.
I got scotch.
Come on. One drink.
I won't be long. I'm on the way to a wedding.
Really? Who's getting married?
I am.
Well, good luck.
Fourth time's the charm, huh?
Fourth?
Dewey. It's J.D.
Any visual on the suspect?
No, sir.
Widen the search area.
Copy that. Proceeding to Quadrants C and D.
Watch the hunting blinds.
Mayor's citation for bravery.
Medal of valor.
Police officer of the year?
Yeah, yeah. Lots of ribbons and plaques.
Nothing for "Father of the year."
I mean, that's what you want to know about, isn't it?
Alice comes from a family of decorated cops.
She took a different path.
It's curious.
It's a lot more than curious.
This is tragic.
That's my daughter, detective.
And even so,
she'd be the one I'd be looking for
if I was still on the force.
Nobody's pointing a finger at you.
Well, maybe they should.
Look, I think about this all the time.
My Alice was perfect in high school.
She was valedictorian, cap--
Captain of the softball team.
And there's every reason to believe
that she would have graduated
first in her class at the academy.
But then, all of a sudden, everything went sideways.
Something happen?
She didn't do as well as I'd hoped, as she had hoped.
She resigned. I mean, she quit.
She said she didn't have the heart for it anymore,
and the only reason why she was there
was because she was, uh --
She was a Mcfadden.
What'd Alice do after that?
It wasn't cop business, so I just didn't care.
It's, uh -- after she got arrested...
I sure learned a lot, didn't I?
Did you visit her in prison?
Hell, no.
I haven't talked to Alice
since she, uh, got her inmate number.
And nobody in my family has, either.
Look, that's it. That's everything, all right?
That's high school, that's the academy.
You mind if I take that down to the station?
Please do.
I'll make sure you get everything back.
No need, detective.
No need.
It's so romantic.
I mean, this is just all about them.
I think it's beautiful.
It still makes me --
Nervous?
Yes.
Why? Do you think I'm going to propose to you?
What?
Don't worry. You're safe.
Feel better?
Oh, yeah.
I won't wear it.
It's a tiny nod to propriety.
Do it for me.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mimi, but this is for me and Vince.
We're having exactly the wedding we want.
Speaking of Vince, Kiki.
I have some real time restraints today.
Yeah, yes. I'll try him again.
No.
Hello, future Mrs. Korsak.
Oh. I am so glad you're here.
Wow. You look --
Oh, thank you.
And wow.
You know.
Hey, where were you?
Ron was worried.
Nothing to do with you.
So it does have to do with me?
I think I'm gonna get something from the bar.
It's not open.
Sure, it is.
Ooh, I can help myself.
Are you ready?
Absolutely.
Great. Let's do this.
Maura called. Jane's gonna be a little late.
Oh. Uh, where's Maura?
She's across at the lab running some tests.
She'll come over when I give the word.
Okay.
Vince.
We're gonna lose Judge Carter.
Everything will be all right.
I'm gonna call Jane and get an exact time.
Okay.
She's not picking up.
Probably driving. I bet she's right around the corner.
You're taller than I expected.
Drop the gun.
You know what Alice did to me.
Can you imagine what she's gonna do to you
when she doesn't need you anymore?
Keep talking while you can.
She left you at the station.
She left you out here to fend for yourself.
She's got a plan.
She tell you that plan?
Shut up.
You better start thinking about yourself, Wendy.
Because Alice only thinks about herself.
She loves me.
Like she loved Joe Harris?
She had sex with him.
For a man, that's as good as love.
So she was just using him?
That's right.
But she's not using you?
Shut...Up.
You know what? Fine.
Let's say Alice does love you.
She killed a state trooper.
These woods are full of angry troopers.
You getting shot. Was that part of the plan?
I love her.
Okay.
But you're not a killer.
You're not.
Give me the gun.
Korsak, I'm so sorry.
Well, you had a gun to your head.
It's not like you stopped to catch a movie.
Yeah, I know, but I just -- I still feel bad.
You have that right.
Um, just -- I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?
Eh, what's a few hours between friends with an open bar?
I'm making Margaritas.
It's Nina. Just apologize to Kiki for me.
Will do.
Nina.
Wendy's family owns a cabin an hour from the gas station.
I'm sure that's where they were headed.
It's about 45 minutes from the Canadian border.
I'm sending you the coordinates.
Okay, thanks.
Where's Miller?
What do you got?
GPS coordinates for a cabin owned by Wendy's family.
You think Alice is there?
Yeah, I think that was her plan.
What surprises me the most
is the moisture retention in this soil.
The pH is decidedly different than the crime scene samples.
Are you reading a comic book?
Uh, yeah.
I found them in the high school box.
These "Archies" are by far the most interesting.
Really? How so?
Well, in every way.
I mean, this guy's got a hell of a lot going on.
Kent.
Of course.
I do have a breakdown
on the organic carbon content of the soil
as well as particle size distribution
and bulk density.
Great. I'd like to see it.
You know, I think Principal Weatherbee's
far too hard on Archie,
and I don't believe for one second he's ex-military.
If I say I agree with you, can we move on?
Of course.
A little space, Kent.
There's no way the mud on those plates is from Maine.
No, it's from the banks of the Charles River.
When did you tell Alice about the family cabin?
Was it a few months after you met her?
I'll bet that you told her
and then quickly, your relationship got physical,
you wanted Alice, she wanted the cabin.
She used you just like she used Joe Harris.
State troopers are at the cabin.
Nobody's there, but it's fully stocked
as if two people were gonna be there for a while.
Car.
No tracks.
So no car, no Alice.
I love her.
She's not capable of love.
She is.
No, she isn't.
She only cares about herself.
That's not true.
Wendy, you got to help yourself.
She loved me.
It doesn't matter now.
It matters.
No.
I matter.
Not to her, you didn't!
I mattered!
Me and her son -- we mattered. And nobody else.
She has a son?
What's his name?
Wendy, what is his --
Frankie.
What's up?
Alice has a son. Call Nina.
Tell her to look somewhere near the Charles River.
I'm sorry, Vince.
The law must be served.
You're a good man.
Well, we can debate that later. Thanks, man.
Jane.
I'm an hour away.
Just start the ceremony without me.
Don't bother. We had to send judge Carter on his way.
Oh, Vince.
No, it's all right.
My best man's worth waiting for.
And don't rush. We've rescheduled for tomorrow.
Where's Alice?
Stay with Kiki, okay? We'll discuss the case tomorrow.
Sorry.
I'm still here.
How's Kiki?
Fine.
Really?
Absolutely.
I'm more concerned about you.
Don't be.
Nina called. She's got something.
Alice is on the run.
She's gonna make a mistake,
And I'm gonna get her, vince. I can feel it.
Come on.
I've been staring at maps
and thinking about where Alice would be going.
The border? Well, she can't get across.
And we have a bolo on the plymouth.
And an apb for Alice. And she knows that.
入境记录 埃斯特科特站- 上午7:04
she dyed her hair.
yeah.
Now she looks like Wendy Allen.
Because nobody's looking for Wendy Allen.
Alice, as Wendy, walked into Canada
at the estcourt station crossing two hours ago.
Okay, she's not dodging us again.
We'll have the rcmp bring her in.
The mounties will get her.
Yeah, I want her here. Now.
Is this everything, Kent?
Uh, yeah.
More "Archie"?
I promise, everything of evidentiary value
is on that wall there.
I do not understand your fascination with these.
It -- they're all just dating
and flirting and crushes and makeouts.
Look.
I went to an all-boys boarding school on a barren heath.
The only girl I ever saw was on a poster for cheese.
These -- they're a great primer for relationships,
Something I know nothing about.
But it's just comic books.
Oh. Here comes Jane.
Thank god.
Well, I guess we'll continue our conversation later, Betty.
And I'll see you later, too, Veronica.
later, jughead. - all right, so you --
Please tell me you've got something good.
I've created a psychological profile of alice sands.
I thought if you could better understand
the way she thought --
I could figure out what she was gonna do next.
Fantastic.
Alice sands, the high school student, was popular.
Homecoming queen.
Smart.
Valedictorian.
National honor society. Wow.
And driven.
"I want to be the first woman president
or the president of the corporation that makes that happen."
All right.
She came from a family of highly decorated police officers,
Which creates a conflict.
When she joined the police academy,
She assumed that she would excel,
But she didn't.
She struggled because you were there.
Wh -- me? I didn't even know her.
Well, she knew you,
And she recorded your time in the mile,
your test scores,
All of which were faster and higher than hers.
You can graduate number two and still be a good cop.
Well, for Alice Sands,
anything less than number one was a failure
to herself and to her family.
Some rough life.
Based on this profile, Alice's fixation with you,
The seeds of which were planted in the police academy,
bloomed when she was in prison.
cut off from her family,
she lost all connection to who she was.
And she had a lot of time to think.
A narcissistic high achiever
needs somebody to blame when things go wrong.
And Alice Sands believes that you're the reason
that her life didn't go as planned.
I just don't think she's gonna stop coming after you, Jane.
I think you're right.
I'm sorry.
No, don't be. This is great.
Jane.
Wait. Jane.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
What does the target of an obsessive narcissist do
to draw their attention?
This is a bad road.
Well, I didn't pick this road.
I'm sure as hell not gonna let her drive.
Wedding. Yes. Going to get ready.
Don't. I just sent Kiki home.
Why? Did you call it off?
Postponed.
Frankie and Nina found Alice Sands' son.
Eric Stone visited Wendy
every single week she was incarcerated.
And when Wendy was released, he visited Joanne Scott,
the cellmate who replaced her.
In Alice Sands' cell.
Because he wasn't visiting Wendy.
He was visiting Alice.
Do you know where we can find him?
I do.
波士顿剑桥大学
"BCU -- a renowned institute of higher learning
located by the beautiful Charles River.
Where you can get a great education
in an historic setting."
And mud for your license plate.
All right, look. We'll divide and conquer.
Tonight. 7:00 at the libes?
Excuse me. Eric Stone?
Alice Sands' son?
That's a yes.
Take it easy.
Eric Stone.
Anthropology major.
Dean's list. Service award.
Doesn't add up.
Why? Because of my mother?
Alice Sands isn't actually your mother.
Biologically? No.
Legally, no. You were never adopted.
And yet on your college registration forms,
it says, "Emergency contact:
Alice Sands, mother."
We don't have papers, but she's my mother.
She saved my life, took care of me,
Set me on the right path.
She loves me.
We're listening.
I never knew my dad.
I was 5 when my mon OD'd.
I bounced around between relatives.
When I was 14, my cousin Freddie had me on the street
as a lookout while he sold drugs.
Alice lived in the neighborhood.
She took me in.
And were you a part of her drug business?
She's a legitimate businesswoman.
They why'd you run?
You framed her, you can frame me.
She wasn't framed.
Look.
Alice put me on the right track,
made me stay in school, paid my tuition.
Okay, and then she turned to crime.
No, she was framed.
By who?
Cops.
What cops?
I don't know, but that's what she told me.
She was in jail because of cops.
She's a great woman, my mother.
The best.
Hey. Got some news.
Alice Sands was spotted getting off a bus in Quebec city.
They've tracked her to a warehouse district.
They've cordoned off a two-block radius.
As soon as backup arrives, they'll move in.
Got to love the Mounties.
Yeah, let us know as soon as they have her.
Will do.
Thanks, Frankie.
Yeah.
That's good.
I'll make sure the extradition goes quickly.
Great.
I don't get Alice Sands at all.
Bad person that did something good with this kid.
Do you think she has legitimate businesses?
Looking to change?
Turn back into the Alice she was supposed to be?
Or these legitimate businesses
were just a cover for her drug operation.
I think she killed a cop. That's my bet.
To say the least.
Hey, Kiki.
Okay.
Well, let's talk.
All right.
Everything all right?
I'm not sure.
Guess when you postpone your wedding twice,
a person could have some questions.
Well, go. Talk to her.
Are you going back in?
No.
I'm gonna let him sit for a while,
Have Nina check out these legitimate businesses,
start to dismantle her organization.
That's not what I said.
I would never tell you to draw a sociopath to you.
Well, that's what I heard.
Well, you heard what you wanted to hear.
Doesn't everybody?
Not like you.
That's not true.
Okay.
I just want you to stay in one piece.
Okay, well, that we can agree on.
Hi, ma.
Hi!
Can you, um, describe me?
What?
Just, you know, like what kind of person you think I am.
Uh, what's going on?
Jane is trying to figure out
why this Alice Sands is so obsessed with her.
Oh. Okay.
Someone with your confidence and drive
can seem like a complete mystery
to a person who lacks one or the other.
So therefore, they feel intimidated.
That's the non-clinical version, and she's right.
I don't mean to be intimidating.
But you are.
Yeah, you don't mean to be a pain in the ass, either,
but sometimes I --
Yes, I wonder where I got that.
It's a mystery.
Oh, there's something going on with Korsak and Kiki.
This looks serious.
Oh. He looks angry.
No, no, no. That's just his face.
We have an announcement.
It's kind of a big one, if we could get your attention.
What? It's beautiful.
Ron, do you think you could help out?
Okay.
Who's that?
Okay. Here we go.
The sister.
We both realized that given what I do,
there will always be another emergency.
Yes.
And we've tried to keep this wedding as simple as possible,
which hasn't worked.
You're not canceling the wedding.
We're getting married in 20 minutes.
Judge Carter's on the way.
Yeah!
Yes, and I'll make coffee for Mimi.
I'll throw some water on her.
And I have to change.
Yes. Oh! So do I!
Okay. Bye, ma.
Bye.
Do you have a dress in a drawer?
Maybe. Where's yours?
Evidence locker.
Any word from the mounties?
They're getting ready to move in.
Which I just told my sister two minutes ago.
I'll tell her again.
I tracked Eric Stone's BCU tuition check
to an "S" corp controlled by Alice Sands.
That led me down this trail.
"Quincy street investments.
West End appliances.
New Brunswick woodworks."
These are legitimate?
Seems like it,
but their origin,
tax information that details what they do,
it's all buried under layers of shell corporations
and registering agents.
Why would you do that if they're clean?
Because you're using them for things that aren't.
Wedding's on.
Yes, it is. I'm getting my hat.
Okay.
Wait. You have a special wedding hat?
It's just a little hat.
It's only right for weddings.
You know, those Canadian businesses might make it easier
to move things across the border.
Nice.
Thank you.
Aren't you coming?
Oh, yeah.
I just got to call Nicole. She's coming.
Great.
It is great, right?
That's what I said. Why wouldn't it be?
I don't know. I just thought you should know.
Now I know.
Great.
See you there.
Yeah.
Kiki--
Wait. Sorry.
Can we all just make sure that our cellphones are off?
Thank you, Jane.
Kiki.
When I'm not with you,
I will be waiting for you.
You will always be in my life.
Vince.
How did I get so lucky?
By the power vested in me
by the commonwealth of massachusetts,
I now pronounce you Vince and Kiki Korsak.
It's official!
Out of sin!
so what do you think?
Slim pickings. Mm-hmm.
Just got slimmer.
Did I miss it?
God.
Yes.
Oh, God. The pleats take forever to iron.
Oh, Kent. You're wearing a dress.
No, Jane. It's a kilt.
And this kilt needs swinging.
No.
Fine. Suit yourself.
Not too much swinging, all right?
Oh, God.
You know they don't wear anything under those?
Yes, I know that.
Uh, you need to go that way.
Get up. Go.
Goodbye. Now. Hurry. Go.
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take
He's killing me.
My sunshine away
I can't hear you.
I've got the ocean in my eyes.
What?
Uh-oh. Look out!
Home! Yeah!
Whoa! Go, Frankie!
Give me a kiss, baby!
Did you see that?
Yeah, this could get good.
And I'm seeing it.
Come on, let's dance.
Oh, no. No, I'm --
You know I'm no good at it.
Uh, excuse me, Angela.
Uh, it would be my utmost honor if I could have this dance.
Whoa, not so fast, buddy.
I haven't danced with my girl yet.
You have a big heart.
Big feet, too.
Yeah, I know.
I've been a crappy best man.
There have been three before you,
and you, Jane Rizzoli, are by far the best...looking.
No, no.
Yeah.
Come on. Come on.
No, I -- - Hello, ladies.
Oh. Oh, oh, oh. Watch it, watch it.
Really? On a poster for cheese?
You poor thing.
At my wedding, you're going to wear
a midnight blue strapless maid of honor dress.
No, I don't think so.
Why not?
Well, with the amount of alcohol that I'm gonna consume,
that -- it's just not gonna work for me.
Okay.
Well, it would be a great color on your skin tone,
so think about it.
Yeah, I've thought about it.
No. I'm gonna need straps.
So the best man needs to make a toast.
Jane?
Oh, God. That's me.
Yes.
Okay.
Toast. Yeah. Toast! Come on!
Toast! Toast! Toast! Toast!
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Speech!
Come on!
I'm no expert on love.
Or marriage.
Or toasts, actually, now that I think about it.
But I have a PhD in Vince Korsak.
So I know what a good man looks like.
And when you look at Kiki,
and Kiki, when you look at him, and you smile, it just --
That's what true love is.
That's what true love looks like.
So, uh, to Vince and Kiki. May you always look like that.
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!
My God, I thought the plumbing exploded again.
Rice for you.
Rice for -- - No!
We're supposed to throw this at Korsak?
It's traditional.
I think it's gonna piss him off.
Nah, what do you think, Maura?
Is he armed?
Back home, it's tradition to capture the groom,
strip him to the waist, and blacken him with treacle
and then parade him around the village.
All right.
I'm crossing "See a Scottish wedding"
off my bucket list.

Thank you.
All right, tomorrow.
Could you not?
It's the fourth one.
I mean, like, come on. Seriously.
Gun!
