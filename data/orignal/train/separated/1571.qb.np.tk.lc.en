zachary !
who is that ?
my mom .
i don &apos;t have time for a girlfriend right now . i &apos;m sorry .
you don &apos;t trust your business partner ?
we &apos;re not business partners .
we could be .
i know that you were at school making fake ids .
did you steal the e @-@ readers , too ?
vico did .
i accused daphne of taking them .
i just got off my adhd meds .
well that &apos;s cool .
nervous ? harness that energy and focus .
focus is key .
i really like you but i love lexi .
but i really think we need to break up .
if you &apos;re interested in using me as a sperm donor , i &apos;m in .
if you wanna use timothy ,
i think we should get together , all three of us , and talk about it .
the lawyer would like to know
if you two would like to see your father first .
oh , we don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t have to . but i wanna see my dad .
he has agreed to sign away his parental rights .
you look just like your mother .
you wanna come in ?
no . i , uh ...
i just ... i wanna know what you &apos;re gonna say to jude .
what ? what do you mean ?
well , when he asks you why you stopped writing ,
and why when you got out of prison like a year ago ,
you didn &apos;t even bother to call us ...
and don &apos;t say that you think we &apos;re better off
without you because we both know that that is a cop out .
i had to get my life back together , callie .
had to get a job , had to ...
... find a decent place to live .
before you could even talk to us ?
no .
before i could get you back .
i didn &apos;t want this to go down like this .
i wanted to have something to offer you .
it just ... it takes time .
i just wanna do right by you kids .
no , you can &apos;t ... you can &apos;t say those things to jude .
you &apos;re just gonna confuse him .
callie , please , you &apos;ve gotta give me a chance , callie ...
no , no , you &apos;re too late .
please .
no , you &apos;re too late .
your dinner &apos;s in the oven . how was group ?
i didn &apos;t go .
i just , um ... couldn &apos;t deal with it today
so i hung out in the lobby .
i wasn &apos;t like playing candy crush or anything ,
i did homework .
but group is a condition of your probation , you know .
she knows .
and your p.o. is going to get your attendance report .
no , i know . i &apos;m gonna make it up .
i just ... had a bad day .
you wanna talk about it ?
no , i &apos;m just hungry .
i think this whole thing with her father signing away his rights
is probably hitting her pretty hard , you know .
yeah , well , that &apos;s all the more reason for her to go to group ,
so she can talk about it .
well , give her some time . she will .
not all of us are like you with your relentless need
to process things the very second they happens .
some of us just need a little more time to figure out how we feel .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m moving in .
to brandon &apos;s room ?
no . no way . what if i want it ?
too bad . snoozers are losers . get out of my room .
it &apos;s not your room !
hey , hey , what is happening in here ?
he &apos;s trying to move into brandon &apos;s room .
mariana comes here .
like , don &apos;t i get a say in this ?
it &apos;s my room .
it is my room now . i need some peace and quiet .
i can &apos;t concentrate !
well , duh , you have adhd .
oh , hey . all right , that is enough , mariana . go to your room .
thank you .
what are you doing ? what are you doing ? what are you doing ?
i &apos;m making the bed ...
no no no no no . no one is moving in here .
go on , get out of here !
you just told mariana ...
to go back to her room , yes ,
and the same applies to you . go , now .
fine .
don &apos;t blame me when i fail algebra .
really ?
演唱者 amy stroup
are ... you gonna eat those ?
hey , so i &apos;ve been thinking , um ...
are you sure ? are you sure you wanna see dad ?
what are you hoping he &apos;s gonna say ?
i guess i just want a chance to say goodbye .
but what if he doesn &apos;t ... say goodbye , i mean ... ?
what if he says , like , he wants to get us back or something ?
he won &apos;t , but if he did , what would you think ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , he is our dad .
he up yet ?
he &apos;s in the shower .
so listen , uh ...
i wanted to thank you for the money and everything .
and i want you to know that i &apos;m gonna pay you back .
i promise . i &apos;m gonna get a job , or ...
school is your job .
let &apos;s just say the money was a gift ?
are you serious ?
totally .
makes me happy to help you out .
i do have one request , though .
you need to start playing piano again .
sure .
so get to it .
right now ?
come on , play for the cook .
ok .
sorry .
wow . how &apos;d you make this happen ?
he hasn &apos;t touched that thing since he moved in .
maybe i &apos;m a good influence .
so , um ...
i &apos;ve been thinking about our talk the other night ,
you know , you moving in , and you &apos;re right .
brandon probably has resented sharing stef and lena
all this time ...
... you know , with the twins and now callie and jude and ...
i just don &apos;t want him to feel like he has to share me , too .
you know . not right now .
yeah , of course .
no , you &apos;re right . you &apos;re 100 % right .
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t appreciate everything you &apos;re doing . i do .
just maybe when he moves back to his mom &apos;s
we can ... revisit the idea .
yeah , of course .
ok .
你在哪
oh @-@ oh , bad news ?
if you consider getting kissed
and dumped on the same day bad news .
well , you didn &apos;t give him your underwear , too , did you ?
relax , i &apos;m kidding .
since i moved to dad &apos;s ,
i don &apos;t get to tease you as much .
kinda my job as a big brother .
yeah , well , we miss you , too .
how is everyone ? how &apos;s callie ?
is she happy to be home ?
she is . how about you , how &apos;s life in the man cave ?
i &apos;m on lock down .
why ?
i told my dad about the piano money and everything .
ouch . well , it sucks you &apos;re grounded , but to be honest ,
i &apos;m a little relieved that mike &apos;s isn &apos;t all fun and games ,
&apos;cause then you &apos;d never want to come home .
i mean , you are gonna move back , right ?
definitely .
good , &apos; cause jesus is eyeing your room .
if you don &apos;t come soon ,
you might not have a room to come home to .
don &apos;t be a stranger .
foster , you ok ?
i don &apos;t get this crap .
if i fail this midterm ,
i &apos;m totally getting kicked off the wrestling team .
haven &apos;t you been studying ?
i &apos;m tryin &apos; .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s tough with lexi in town .
lexi left . we broke up .
oh , yeah ?
she hooked up with some guy in honduras .
hey , do you think maybe you and me could study together tonight ?
yeah ... i don &apos;t think i can .
sorry .
i need my own room .
need ? really ? well i need one direction tickets .
i &apos;m pretty that &apos;s not gonna happen either .
come on . what is it gonna take for you to help me convince moms
that i should get brandon &apos;s room ?
tommy , i &apos;ll have that .
whatever .
jesus .
so if i do your chores for a week ?
a week ? oh hells no . six months .
six months ? are you insane .
i &apos;m not gonna be your slave . one month .
four .
one .
mmmm ... no , i don &apos;t think so .
two months .
then you &apos;ve got to go to bat for me with moms .
sucker . i would &apos;ve done it for one .
oh god .
oh god . oh god . oh god .
what ?
it &apos;s zac &apos;s mom . i &apos;m pretty sure she hates me .
don &apos;t leave me alone with her .
yeah , good luck , sucker .
you &apos;re mariana , right ?
i &apos;m amanda rogers , zac &apos;s mom .
is zac ok ? he was home sick , right ?
lovesick &apos;s more like it .
and i think that what he really needs is ,
um , a little cheering up .
and just so you know , i just had my annual physical
and got tested for , you know ,
everything and all clear .
what ? this is a primal need for you to spread your seed ?
honey .
what , i just ... i &apos;m curious
why he would want to donate in the first place .
i guess that could seem a little odd to you .
very few people find it in their hearts
to open their homes to foster children ,
not to mention the &quot; high risk &quot; ones .
you &apos;re the kind of parents that
should be bringing kids into this world , so ...
good answer .
um , you &apos;ll , uh , you &apos;ll sign a contract ?
what sort of contract ? i didn &apos;t ...
well , basically that says we &apos;re the parents , not you .
um , yeah , yeah , of course .
and we all agree that anonymity is best , yeah ?
absolutely .
right now we don &apos;t want anyone ,
mostly our kids to know that it &apos;s you ,
especially while they &apos;re your students .
yeah , got it . right , good thinking .
so are we ... are we doing this ?
yeah .
mom ? what are you ... ?
i ... i was visiting your beautiful mama .
hmm . romance at lunch . nice . way to up your game .
i ... i don &apos;t need more game .
i &apos;ve got plenty of game .
zac &apos;s mom invited me over for dinner tonight .
is it ok if i eat there ?
i promise i &apos;ll be home early . please .
that &apos;s not the problem .
we were planning on inviting b over for dinner tonight .
there &apos;s a couple of things we want to talk to you guys about .
what about ? is everything ok ?
nothing &apos;s wrong , just a kind of a ...
you know , how &apos;s @-@ everybody @-@ doing
check in / update kinda thing . sort of a team meeting .
well , have you talked to mike about that ?
because team member brandon is grounded .
he &apos;s grounded ?
演唱者 almost free
you couldn &apos;t even answer my texts ?
i have a limited data plan .
oh , come on .
ok , i know what i did sucks .
you asked me to forgive you once .
how about you return the favor ?
why you even want to be friends ?
the only thing we have in common is girls united
and that &apos;s history .
well , history means something to me .
not like i have that much of it .
so what happens the next time something goes missing ?
i &apos;m always gonna be a thief or a drug dealer to you .
no , that &apos;s not true .
i &apos;m sorry . ok , really .
i know what it &apos;s like to be judged for your past .
and i know , you and i don &apos;t have exactly the same background .
but it &apos;s not like i belong at anchor beach either ,
with girls who ugly cry when
their facebook photos don &apos;t get enough &quot; likes . &quot;
i &apos;m not kidding .
i saw my dad .
look , i know how bad it feels
to be out of the loop when it comes to our son .
it &apos;s how i &apos;ve felt the past ten years , but i had to trust
that you and lena were always looking out
for b &apos;s best interest , now you have to trust me .
you must be loving this .
your chance to turn the tables on us , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m not loving this .
this isn &apos;t about me , this isn &apos;t a game , stef .
it &apos;s about our son .
look , ever since callie came to live with you guys ,
brandon &apos;s been acting out .
oh , really , ok .
yes .
and the good news is ,
that he came clean about the money and gave it all back .
he &apos;s talking to me , he trusts me .
he &apos;s back on the right track .
i think living here is great for him .
brandon may be living under your roof ,
but i am still his mother , and technically ,
mike , legally , i have custody .
i &apos;m well aware of that , stef .
i will not be kept out of the loop
when it comes to what is going on with my son .
i need to be consulted about every decision regarding him .
ok .
thank you .
i thought you handled that really well .
but , listen , if he &apos;s gonna move out eventually ,
isn &apos;t it better to just do it now before we upset everyone ?
i mean , it &apos;s not like stef &apos;s ever gonna give up control .
no .
you know what ?
brandon &apos;s happy here , he &apos;s doing great .
i &apos;m not gonna let stef manipulate me again .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re totally right .
he &apos;s a young man now and he needs his father .
guess what ?
what ?
i &apos;m ovulating !
wow ! whoa . that &apos;s ... wow , ok .
but we still have to have the contract drawn up
and timothy has to sign it .
i hear you , but we both know ,
my hormone levels could drop at any moment .
do we really want to take that chance ?
so i talked to mariana and it &apos;s all good .
uh , what &apos;s all good ?
she &apos;s cool with me moving into brandon &apos;s room .
i didn &apos;t realize that was up for discussion .
it &apos;s not .
what ? why not ?
because it &apos;s brandon &apos;s room and he &apos;s coming home soon .
when ?
i don &apos;t know , sweetheart but it &apos;s gonna be soon .
and when he does , his room &apos;s gonna be waiting for him . got it ?
so i get a half of one room
and brandon gets two rooms .
it &apos;s great , just great . you always put golden boy first .
all right , you know what ?
i think maybe you &apos;re right .
we should just wait until next month to , um , inseminate .
look , sit . sit sit sit .
you always put everyone else first .
let &apos;s not wait .
let &apos;s do it now , ok ?
as long as the contract is signed before the baby is born ,
it &apos;s all good .
are you sure ?
yeah .
but can we just , um ...
maybe wait to tell the kids until we are actually pregnant ?
that would be great .
演唱者 aaron espe
if he was trying to get us back ,
why not at least call us ?
i mean , he &apos;s been out of prison a year .
how long does it take to get your act together
when your kids are at stake ?
it can take longer than you think .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean ...
it &apos;s hard enough trying to get a good job out of juvie ,
let alone outta prison like your dad .
well , you &apos;re nothing like my dad .
how was it ? seeing him , i mean ?
weird .
i thought i was just gonna tell him to leave us alone .
i thought , &quot; you &apos;re the reason that mom &apos;s dead
and then you basically abandoned us , so screw you . &quot;
and then he opened the door , and there he was ...
... my dad .
he was never a great dad .
he wasn &apos;t really around all that much when we were kids .
but he was still my dad .
i just don &apos;t want him confusing
jude with all this bull about wanting us back .
sounds to me like jude &apos;s not the one who &apos;s confused .
what &apos;re you ... doing here ?
your mom invited me . i hope that &apos;s cool .
you brought me flowers ?
oh , no no , these are for ...
mariana ! oh , you made it !
for you , mrs. rogers .
oh , they &apos;re beautiful . thank you .
and stop calling me mrs. rogers . i mean it ,
it makes me feel old .
come on in . welcome .
be a gentleman .
i hope you like garlic .
thank you .
here we go .
oh my goodness , this all looks so delicious .
oh . aren &apos;t you a love .
how come you never brought her over before ?
well , technically , i didn &apos;t bring her over this time .
so tell me about you .
well , um ... i did costumes for the play that zac was ...
i love this song !
get up and dance with me .
what , no , mom , not ...
zachary ! come on ! come on ! get up right now ! come on . come on .
you know i hate it when you call me that .
right . sorry . sorry .
mom , i &apos;m sorry , can we just please eat ?
sure . sure we can . of course .
this looks delicious . who made this ?
you did , mom .
of course i did . i was joking !
you kids never get my jokes .
do you ever wish you had a dad ?
everyone has a dad , i &apos;ve just never met mine .
i miss my mom .
i don &apos;t really remember my dad .
i heard he &apos;s gonna let us adopt you guys .
that &apos;s good news , right ?
yeah .
i &apos;m supposed to see him soon .
you are ? why ?
they asked us if we wanted to and i said i did .
just be careful , ok ?
you remember what happened with me and ana .
come on it .
i &apos;m kinda surprised you came back .
does your ...
your foster family , they know you &apos;re here ?
no , they think i &apos;m working on a project for school .
you want something to drink ? you want me to get you something ?
um , why &apos;d you stop writing to us ?
you know , after you &apos;ve been in prison
for a couple of years , you , uh ...
... you start to think maybe you &apos;re not gonna get out .
i told myself you kids were better off .
truth is , i was pretty messed up .
and i felt ashamed about what i &apos;d done .
and i was just waiting for the day to come
when i &apos;d open up a letter from you ...
... accusing me of murdering your mother .
you didn &apos;t ... murder her .
yeah , i did .
i got drunk , i got behind the wheel , she &apos;s dead .
i mean , i didn &apos;t use a gun ,
but it all added up the same .
oh , i don &apos;t think i should .
oh , don &apos;t be silly .
in europe , everybody lets their kids
have a little nip or two now and then .
here we go .
i ... wanna make a toast .
today is the two @-@ year anniversary
of the day your father walked out on me .
best thing that ever happened to me .
cheers !
mom , dad left ten years ago .
i know , but it feels like two .
son of a bitch . good riddance .
well , now you know .
know what ?
how weird my mom is .
so ?
is this why you didn &apos;t wanna go out with me ?
&apos;cause of your mom ?
oh my god , zac , i love her .
she &apos;s funny and she &apos;s fun and ,
ok , yeah she &apos;s a little kooky , but so what ?
i like kooky . i mean , i like you , don &apos;t i ?
演唱者 sarah fairfield
what &apos;s going on ?
surprise !
i know that you &apos;re into blue ,
but i didn &apos;t know which shade so ...
where did you get this ?
someone told me the weepies is your favorite band .
that &apos;s amazing , thank you .
your dad and i want you to feel at home here ,
with a grown up room .
oh , and i hope you don &apos;t mind , but
that old space buddies bedding had to go .
you didn &apos;t have to do this .
are you kidding ? i love a makeover .
and no offense , but this apartment
is where old black leather couches come to die .
i just mean that ,
you know , i &apos;m not gonna be here forever .
brandon ...
... do you really think that you &apos;re gonna feel comfortable ,
living in that house with callie ?
personally ,
i think that whole thing was handled really poorly .
i mean , she &apos;s not your sister .
you met , what , like a few months ago ?
and if you &apos;re not living under the same roof ,
i just ... i don &apos;t see why you couldn &apos;t have a relationship with her .
i mean , if that &apos;s what you both want .
yeah , i ...
i don &apos;t think my dad would be very down with that .
honey ,
leave him to me . he &apos;s down with more than you know .
so what about you ?
what about me ?
well ... how &apos;ve you been ?
honestly ?
yeah .
um , pretty awful .
jude and i have been in six different foster homes .
they &apos;ve all basically sucked until this one .
and i went to juvie a couple of times myself ,
really ? juvie ?
you were such a good girl .
what ?
no , you just ... you just rubbed your nose like ...
it takes me back .
when you were a little kid ,
you used to rub your nose and suck your thumb to help you go to sleep .
your mom and i thought we broke you of the habit .
callie , i know , i know ,
i failed you and jude in ...
... every way a man can possibly fail his kids ,
and i know this happened all wrong .
you weren &apos;t supposed to show up at my door , looking for me .
i wanna tell you something now , ok ?
and you can take this to the bank .
i am here for you now .
ok , i know i &apos;m out of time ,
and i don &apos;t want to confuse jude any more than you do ,
so just ...
... i &apos;ll tell him whatever you want me to .
i want you to tell him the truth .
mariana it &apos;s the trash day .
it &apos;s your turn to take out the garbage cans , please .
oh , jesus is gonna do that for me .
mmm , no i &apos;m not .
um , we made a deal .
well , deal didn &apos;t work , so it &apos;s off .
you suck .
so i &apos;m not sure if i want to see my dad anymore .
well , it &apos;s normal to be nervous , honey .
it &apos;s not that .
i just ... i don &apos;t know if i want to .
i think you should .
i think we both should . just hear him out at least .
did you have a change of heart , callie ?
yeah , i guess .
i think that &apos;s great , callie .
and jude , you know , i know it &apos;s tough ,
but if you don &apos;t see him , you might regret it later .
i &apos;ll be with you .
if we &apos;re gonna be together ... ok .
ok , great .
so why don &apos;t you guys grab your stuff ,
we &apos;re gonna be late for school .
i just want you both to know
how much jude and i love you .
we know that , honey .
and nothing &apos;s could ever change that .
we love you , too .
so mariana told me about tomorrow , big day .
you finally get to see your dad . you nervous ?
i mean , you haven &apos;t seen him in like what , six years ?
i saw him last night .
you did ? why ?
i mean , i thought he already agreed to sign away his rights .
well , he will , if that &apos;s what jude and i want .
well , it is what you want , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;re not seriously
considering going to live with him or something ?
it &apos;s not that simple .
yes , it is .
callie , you can &apos;t keep changing your mind about what you want .
he didn &apos;t try to call you when he got out of jail .
there are reasons .
no , there are no good ones !
brandon , stop it !
and now you and jude have a family who wants to adopt you
who loves you and what , he suddenly he wants you back ?
you really think he cares ?
stop it ! stop it !
he abandoned you and jude . that &apos;s not what a father does .
don &apos;t tell me about my father .
callie !

第二期夏威夷女孩画刊
well , hello .
those aren &apos;t for us .
what !
they &apos;re for timothy .
oh , come on , he gets to have all the fun .
yeah , well , we get a baby .
that is if we can figure out how to use this kit .
my brandon @-@ making kit was a
bottle of whiskey and the backseat of mike &apos;s car .
i shouldn &apos;t have said that , should i ?
so where exactly do you want timothy to ,
you know , do his ... ?
well , i thought ... our bathroom .
i mean , time really is of the essence here ,
so i thought , you know , he could leave it
and we can run right in and do our thing .
ok .
wow . look at this .
honey .
i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t help you study yesterday . i just ...
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s fine .
i heard the mid @-@ term is gonna cover powers , roots , and radicals .
no polynomials , thank god !
if you want , we can cram at lunch .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;ve got to go home , i &apos;ve gotta grab something .
so no one &apos;s here so you can just take your time .
i always do .
um , you don &apos;t ... you don &apos;t
have to fill the whole thing , it &apos;s ... that &apos;s good .
um , you , shouldn &apos;t use any lotion
or anything like that and , uh ... and we did leave some ...
... some reading material for you in case you need it .
oh . well . thanks .
oh , so our room is at the top of the stairs
and you &apos;ll find everything you need in the bathroom .
and we &apos;ll just wait out back .
come on .
this is crazy .
right ?
we &apos;re gonna have a baby .
i love you .
i love you .
timothy ?
what are you doing here ?
i was just having a parent / teacher conference with your moms .
at your home .
and um , i just needed to use the bathroom , so ...
i &apos;ll see you at school .
um ... jesus is here .
moms !
i just found a cup ...
we know , honey .
you know ?
i think we might wanna tell the kids now .
tell us what ?
so we were going to wait until a little later to tell you guys this ,
but since the cat &apos;s outta the bag ...
we are trying to have a baby .
what .... adopt a baby ?
oh my god , a baby !
we &apos;ve never had one of those . please get a girl !
wait , wait , there &apos;s more .
we &apos;re not gonna adopt .
mama wants to carry the baby .
we &apos;ve decided to give it a try . and we have a donor .
it &apos;s timothy .
timothy , as in our english teacher timothy ?
we wanted it to be anonymous , but your brother ...
basically walked in on timothy in moms &apos; bathroom ...
ok , look , none of this is easy , you guys ,
but we just ... we wanted
someone that we knew and trusted and respected .
and who would make a freaking adorable baby .
so that &apos;s why i can &apos;t have brandon &apos;s room ?
you &apos;re turning it into a nursery ?
if mama gets pregnant , uh ,
the baby will sleep in our bedroom .
we want all of you to be on board with this .
ok , it &apos;s really really important to mama .
i think it &apos;s cool .
yeah , me too .
me three .
and , jesus , if you want to move into my room , it &apos;s yours .
for real ?
yeah .
are you sure about that , bud ?
i mean , you know , until i get back , ok ?
can i start moving in ?
go .
ooh , but after , you need to take the trash bins in from the curb .
a deal &apos;s a deal .
oh , my god , i &apos;m so excited .
you &apos;re seeing your dad , right ?
yeah , tomorrow .
i hope that turns out the way you want .
all right , well , i &apos;m gonna go grab some stuff
before jesus claims squatter rights and keeps it all .
ok .
well , see you later , honey .
no , not yet .
don &apos;t let go .
no , you hang up .
no , you hang up first .
i don &apos;t wanna hang up first .
i don &apos;t wanna either .
ok , fine . goodnight , zac .
good night .
ok , fine , but we can only
