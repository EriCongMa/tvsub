professor gerard .
i came to ask for a favor .
the answer is no .
which is why i brought this .
you know .
and you talk a big game ,
but you &apos;re just as human as everyone else ,
you smug son of a bitch .
louis .
what are you doing here ?
leaving .
that way i don &apos;t have to look at either one of you two liars .
oh , my god , he knows .
he doesn &apos;t just know .
he &apos;s a name partner .
she came to me and lied to my face .
she did it to protect me
i &apos;m gonna keep hammering on her
until you break .
with a new name comes a new beginning .
here &apos;s to our newest name partner , louis litt .
louis has something on you .
daniel hardman embezzled money from the firm ,
and i covered it up .
why couldn &apos;t you trust me with that before ?
because i didn &apos;t know how you &apos;d react ,
jessica ,
your secret is safe with me .
i thought we were done with rooftop conversations .
some things require privacy .
i haven &apos;t heard you say that
since the midnight coup of schmidt , gordon , and van dyke .
you done ?
it wasn &apos;t a joke .
neither is this .
i told jeff malone i helped cover up
daniel hardman &apos;s embezzlement .
why the hell would you open that time capsule ?
because he knew the explanation
we gave the partners about louis was bullshit ,
and i had to tell him something .
you could &apos;ve told him it was none of his business .
harvey , i didn &apos;t bring you here
to get relationship advice .
i brought you here to tell you what i did
in case it ever came up .
no , you didn &apos;t .
you brought me here because now
you have to get louis to back you ,
and you knew you &apos;d be mad at me
when i told you what you didn &apos;t want to hear .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t want to hear it .
how do you think it &apos;s gonna go
when i tell louis he holds
the fate of my relationship in his hands ?
how do you think it &apos;s gonna go
the first time malone brings up louis &apos; blackmail ?
i don &apos;t care .
well , i &apos;ll tell you how it &apos;s gonna go .
louis is gonna look back
with his beady little eyes and say , &quot; embezzlement ?
that &apos;s not how i got my name on the wall . &quot;
and the shit &apos;s gonna hit the fan anyway .
you know what ?
you can be a real son of a bitch .
yeah , but instead of being pissed at me ,
why don &apos;t you take a look in the mirror ?
because we held out an olive branch ,
and after louis hears this ,
he &apos;s gonna take that branch
and beat the shit out of us with it .
louis .
professor gerard ? what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve got a small legal matter to attend to .
well , is it anything i can help you with ?
actually , i &apos;m here to speak with harvey .
i understand .
you &apos;re looking for a name partner .
well , you can &apos;t quite see it from here ,
but if you walk back about ten feet ,
take a gander to your left ,
you &apos;ll see i &apos;ve gotten a little recognition--
i appreciate that , but as i said ,
i &apos;m here to speak with harvey .
so are we gonna talk about that little welcome speech
that jessica made for louis ?
we don &apos;t have to talk about it
because louis isn &apos;t going to accept it .
why not ?
because it &apos;ll be a cold day in hell
when he can accept being maverick to my iceman .
著名电影 《 壮志凌云 》 中主角代号
don &apos;t--don &apos;t you mean iceman to your maverick ?
no , i don &apos;t .
you actually want to be iceman over maverick ?
who got the trophy ?
who &apos;s the better pilot ?
the one who got the trophy .
wrong .
because in the end , maverick saved iceman ,
and if he hadn &apos;t , trophy boy would be sitting
on the bottom of the indian ocean right now .
where he &apos;d still be the man .
according to you .
according to me is the only &quot; according to &quot; that matters .
here we go .
maybe , but according to me ,
viper was the real hero of that film .
what ?
you think i &apos;m too old to know top gun ?
what i think is ,
you have no business being in my office .
are we gonna do this in front of your associate ?
we don &apos;t have to do anything in front of anybody .
you just have to go .
harvey ...
i need a lawyer .
louis &apos; office is down the hall .
i don &apos;t want louis .
i want you .
that &apos;s funny .
the last time you saw me , you told me
i wasn &apos;t fit to practice law in your ivory tower .
what i told you was ,
is that you &apos;ll sacrifice ethics for wins ,
and right now i &apos;m not in my ivory tower ,
and i need a win .
i knew it .
you &apos;re just like everybody else .
the ends don &apos;t justify the means
until it &apos;s your ass on the line .
do you think i like asking you for help ?
i think this liberty rail thing must have you by the balls .
so you know .
i know after their train derailed ,
you were appointed to assess the victims &apos; compensation formula ,
and i know after you did ,
some of those victims hired a lawyer
and opened an investigation .
then you also know they found nothing .
then the question is , why are you here ?
the tsa found $ 25,000 in my luggage
the day i announced i was changing the formula .
so now you &apos;re being accused of accepting a bribe .
which i did not do .
well , good luck proving that , professor ,
because it won &apos;t be with my help .
i was wrong about you , mr. specter .
i never thought that you wouldn &apos;t represent somebody
just because you didn &apos;t like them .
well , you &apos;re wrong again .
i don &apos;t like you , but i &apos;m not representing you
because you did something shady ,
and i &apos;m not screwing over crash victims
for the likes of you .
you know i didn &apos;t do this .
what i know is you showed yourself in .
you can show yourself out .
hey , i didn &apos;t want to say anything
in front of gerard , but has it occurred to you
that you &apos;re an idiot if you don &apos;t take this case ?
last year , you were shitting yourself
he &apos;d find out about you ,
and now you think we should work with him ?
no , i wasn &apos;t worried he &apos;d find out .
i was worried about louis .
gerard didn &apos;t bat an eye at me back then ,
and he didn &apos;t just now .
but we get him out of this
and he ever does find out about me ,
he &apos;s gonna owe us .
mike , that man is never gonna compromise his ethics
just because we got him out of a jam .
never gonna compromise his ethics ?
you just said he took a bribe .
so what does that have to do with anything ?
it has everything to do with everything
because you don &apos;t think he did it .
so what ?
so what ?
that means you &apos;re not turning him down
because you think he &apos;s shady .
you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re turning him down because you have
a henry gerard @-@ sized chip on your shoulder .
i do not have a chip on my shoulder .
you sure sound like you do ,
which makes you worse than an idiot .
it makes you a jackass .
excuse me ?
you heard me .
you know that he divided that money fairly ,
which means that you &apos;re just--
i don &apos;t care what it means ,
and i don &apos;t need a lecture from you .
apparently you do ,
because you &apos;re about to screw over
a bunch of innocent people
just to stick it to some guy who hurt your feelings .
that &apos;s not something i ever thought
i &apos;d be saying to you .
look who it is ,
the woman who put me in my place .
what now ?
you want me to sign a piece of paper
admitting that i was the man on the grassy knoll ?
i meant what i said at the ceremony , louis .
you mean the ceremony that you only had
in order to trick me ?
i had it because you demanded it ,
but i &apos;m not here to talk about that .
i &apos;m here to talk about jeff malone .
what about him ?
you may be aware that he and i are--
fifty shades of grey ? i &apos;m aware .
i &apos;m gonna let that go
because you may also not be aware
that i had to lie to him .
he doesn &apos;t know about mike , does he ?
no .
but he does know you committed a crime
and that you resigned
and now your name is up on the wall .
what &apos;d you tell him ?
i told him you found out
that i covered up daniel hardman &apos;s embezzlement
and that you used it to strong @-@ arm me .
and now you want me to protect another one of your secrets .
it &apos;s the same secret , louis ,
and you have just as much invested in it as i do .
no , i don &apos;t , because i don &apos;t care
if your relationship with jeff survives or not .
what do you want , louis ?
i want something for continuing to cover your ass .
you got something . you got your name on the wall .
now i want the respect that comes with it .
meaning ?
i want one of harvey &apos;s clients .
which one ?
that &apos;s between me and harvey .
okay .
i agreed to meet .
i hope it &apos;s not just so you can tell me
more about what a horrible person i am .
i came here to tell you that i changed my mind .
so you admitted to yourself that i didn &apos;t do this ?
i &apos;ve admitted to myself that you came to me
because this case needs rule @-@ bending ,
and you &apos;re gonna tell me why right now .
the money .
yes , the money .
if you weren &apos;t bribed ,
where the hell did you get that $ 25,000 from ?
you know where it came from .
it &apos;s the same thing you tried to
use to blackmail me last year .
let me get this straight .
you have an explanation for the money
that would get you out of this whole thing .
but i can &apos;t use it .
where are you going ?
to get you out of this .
welcome to the real world , professor .
i need you to find out everything you can on garrett brady .
absolutely . who &apos;s garrett brady ?
the guy on the other side of gerard &apos;s suit .
wait a second .
does this mean you took his case ?
you know that means i took his case ,
and i don &apos;t want to hear any gloating .
gloating ? no , no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m not-- i &apos;m not gloating .
i &apos;m merely recognizing the fact that
you completely changed your mind
based entirely on what i said .
which is gloating .
&quot; po @-@ tay @-@ to , &quot; &quot; po @-@ tah @-@ to . &quot;
but as long as you &apos;re gonna think of it that way ,
i might as well point out
that since you listened to my lecture ,
maybe you should start calling me professor .
i &apos;m gonna start calling you unemployed
if you don &apos;t figure out a way around using gerard &apos;s alibi .
wait , we can &apos;t say where the money came from ?
no , we can &apos;t , because he was playing backroom poker ,
and if that comes out , harvard fires him .
are you kidding me ?
he &apos;s an ethics professor , and he &apos;s breaking the law ?
where the hell do you think my chip comes from ?
well , if we can &apos;t use his alibi ,
how are we supposed to get him out of this ?
i don &apos;t know , professor ,
but you &apos;re the one who wanted us to take this case ,
so why don &apos;t you use that big brain of yours
and find a solution ?
you &apos;re giving me henry gerard .
what ?
i saw him . i want him .
you got him . he &apos;s mine .
that &apos;s not the way it works , louis .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll have to find yourself another boyfriend .
oh , this is exactly how it works .
you talked to jessica , didn &apos;t you ?
sure did , and she used me to cover her ass ,
so i get one of your clients in return .
you want one of my clients , we can talk about that ,
but gerard &apos;s staying with me .
please , don &apos;t pretend
like you actually care about him .
he can &apos;t even stand you .
louis , i just offered to consider giving you
one of my clients ,
so i suggest you let gerard go .
no , i &apos;m not letting anything go ,
because it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
not only can &apos;t he stand you .
he doesn &apos;t respect you because he &apos;s got things ...
what did you just say to me ?
i said he doesn &apos;t respect you .
well , you know what ?
he definitely doesn &apos;t respect you ,
because when he told me he needed a lawyer ,
i tried to send him your way ,
and his exact words were ,
&quot; i don &apos;t want louis . i want you . &quot;
fine .
then i &apos;ll just take another one of your clients .
you &apos;re not taking a thing .
you just said that i could ...
look , i don &apos;t give a shit what i just said , okay ?
my clients are my clients .
and you don &apos;t get out of my office
in the next three seconds ,
something &apos;s gonna happen between you and me ,
and i guarantee it won &apos;t end with you
keeping all of your teeth .
no .
just turn around and walk right back out that door .
harvey .
did you hear what i said ?
i did , but apparently , you didn &apos;t hear
what jessica said about wiping the slate clean .
and apparently , you didn &apos;t hear what i said ,
because i just told louis he could have one of my clients .
and three seconds later , you told him he couldn &apos;t .
because i realized that
i &apos;m paying for jessica &apos;s mistake .
no , harvey , you were willing to pay for her mistake
right up until louis said gerard doesn &apos;t respect you .
oh , that has nothing to do with it .
you can lie to yourself all you want ,
but i &apos;m not gonna let you bullshit me .
what the hell are you talking about ?
henry gerard is the one person you respect
who never respected you , and louis touched that nerve .
and i told you that has nothing to do with it .
you really think that ?
i don &apos;t think it . i know it .
then you know what , harvey ?
you &apos;re no different than louis ,
because you have a chance to help us all move on ,
and you are blowing it off out of pettiness ,
which is exactly what louis would do .
what do you want from me , donna ?
i want you to be a grown @-@ up
and do what you said you &apos;d do in the first place .
you got something ?
yeah , we &apos;ve been overlooking the obvious .
yeah , i &apos;m not in the mood for 20 questions .
give it to me .
unless you &apos;re traveling internationally and don &apos;t report it ,
carrying cash on board a plane
isn &apos;t a crime .
great , except for the fact
that gerard &apos;s not being charged with smuggling .
he &apos;s being sued .
right , but my point is ,
how did garrett brady even find that out ?
well , he found out because gerard
was detained by the tsa .
who talked to him for five minutes
and then sent him on his way .
those searches aren &apos;t a matter of public record .
exactly .
holy shit .
brady bribed the t.s.a ..
which isn &apos;t only illegal .
it makes that report totally inadmissible .
you figured this out on your own ?
well , i would &apos;ve done it faster ,
but i had to order some sushi .
&quot; would &apos;ve done it faster . &quot;
that &apos;s what you said your first week here ,
except it was pizza instead of sushi .
yeah , i &apos;m growing .
you mean rachel taught you how to eat .
like i said , i &apos;m growing .
hey , donna , i &apos;m a little busy at the moment .
too busy to take on this ?
what &apos;s that ?
just the first client that jessica gave harvey
when he made name partner .
harvey said he wouldn &apos;t let me have any of his clients .
no . he said he would .
but then instead of taking him up on it ,
you went ahead and shit on his feelings .
please . harvey doesn &apos;t have feelings .
that &apos;s not true , and you know it .
and you of all people should know that a person
can overreact when they &apos;re hurt .
if you &apos;re referring to me ,
i do not overreact when--
okay , whatever you say , fatty @-@ baldy .
okay , get the hell out of my office and--
fine , you have a small , legitimate point .
i really hurt his feelings ?
yeah , you really did .
but then he realized he was overreacting
and that this was a chance for us all
to get back to where we were .
you swear that is the first client
that jessica gave him after me made name partner ?
i swear .
leave me the file .
you two go ahead . i haven &apos;t decided yet .
actually , we &apos;re not here for the falafel .
we &apos;re here to introduce ourselves .
mike ross .
harvey specter .
we represent henry gerard .
well , in that case , let me buy you two lunch ,
because i &apos;m about to come into an unexpected windfall .
well , i guess that &apos;s your thing--
paying people off .
i hope the tsa got more than some shitty falafel .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about this .
bribery ?
ironic , isn &apos;t it ?
you suing professor gerard for accepting a bribe
when you &apos;re the one paying off federal employees .
allegedly paying , counselor .
you don &apos;t want to slander me .
so you admit it .
i don &apos;t admit a thing .
your client sold out victims of a train derailment .
he &apos;s going to pay .
you may not be willing to admit anything here ,
but you &apos;ll have to in front of the judge .
because i &apos;ve drafted subpoenas
for every tsa employee on duty that night .
drop the case , mr. brady .
are you threatening me ?
no , we &apos;re informing you .
well , let me inform you .
in case you forgot , the tsa falls
under the department of homeland security ,
which makes this a national security issue .
this has nothing to do
with national security , and you know it .
all i know is the government found
a large sum of cash on a passenger .
now , how they came to know that ,
how they proceeded to investigate that ,
or what they did with that information
is the government &apos;s business .
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going with ?
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m going with .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to go with .
so you can call up as many tsa agents as you like ,
but they &apos;re not gonna be saying a thing .
and you can buy your own damn falafel .
i need cutie pie cosmetics .
you want to try that again ?
i have a meeting with joan walsh tonight ,
and i need her files .
joan is harvey &apos;s client .
not anymore .
since when ?
since it doesn &apos;t matter ,
because i &apos;m name partner ,
which means when i say i need something ,
your response should either be ,
&quot; how high ? &quot; or &quot; can i have another ? &quot;
fine .
there are a few things that you should know--
you see , what i know is
your boss seems to think
all it takes to impress joan walsh
is getting donna to make a fancy dinner reservation ,
but i &apos;m going to impress her with so much legal domination
that by the end of the night ,
all she &apos;s gonna be able to say is ,
&quot; harvey specter who ? &quot;
okay , that &apos;s a mistake--
a mistake ?
oh , i get it .
you &apos;re trying to impress me
with your legal domination
to prove that you &apos;re not just a paralegal
but an associate .
no , louis . i &apos;m--
see , i don &apos;t care what you call yourself .
so unless you did such a shitty job ,
the files are unreadable ,
hand &apos; em over to me right now .
that &apos;s more like it .
what &apos;s this ?
i know you have to work tonight ,
but you also need to eat .
i wouldn &apos;t call this just eating .
well , you deserve better than paper plates .
i don &apos;t mind paper plates .
oh , i know you don &apos;t .
i just said you deserve better .
is that ropa vieja ?
i made it myself .
which means you got it at the cuban place
that i love on 40th and lex .
by myself .
what did i do to deserve this ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m just ...
feeling closer .
because i confided in you .
because the walls are coming down ,
and i can feel it .
what did i do to deserve you ?
well , we can talk about that
over this delicious meal that i made all by myself .
to us .
and then i said , &quot; helen ,
that &apos;s no pomeranian .
that &apos;s a pomimo .
you &apos;ve been had . &quot;
that is hilarious .
really , dogs , they are--
they are so fascinating .
do you have many dogs , louis ?
hell , no .
building regulations-- it &apos;s a cluster of f @-@ f @-@ f ...
i &apos;ve been fighting them for years .
oh , that &apos;s horrible .
yes .
as is what &apos;s going on with your stock .
louis , we &apos;re having dinner .
put that away .
no , no , no .
but i just thought you &apos;d be interested to know that
we could skyrocket the share price--
right now what i &apos;m interested in
is having another manhattan
and hearing what &apos;s on the dessert list .
you don &apos;t need a list . get the crème br ? lée .
now , this stock issue , i have--
fax the papers to my office ,
and i &apos;ll review them when i get home .
when you get home ?
what the f @-@ f ...
what the hell did we come to dinner for , then ?
for this .
what this ?
this .
okay .
i don &apos;t know how harvey handled these quarterly reviews ,
but i--
oh , harvey ...
was magnificent .
truth be told , i was a little disappointed
when i heard that you &apos;d be handling this
instead of him ,
but i haven &apos;t seen your cha @-@ cha yet ,
so the jury &apos;s still out .
此句直译为 &quot; 陪审团还没回来 &quot;
that was a lawyer joke .
yep . got it .
yep .
listen , joan ,
i think you &apos;re gonna be really glad
that it was me here tonight ,
because i already sent a letter to your board .
and i--
you did what ?
i notified them of this .
that &apos;s --
what i &apos;m trying to tell you .
why the hell would you do something so patently stupid ?
stupid ?
hey , i didn &apos;t become name partner being stupid .
didn &apos;t you ?
two members of my board
are about to reach their term limits .
at least one is being circled by glamour cosmetics .
you have just notified that person of a product
that i &apos;ve had in r &amp; d for years ,
and now they can trade information
for a seat on the board of my biggest competitor .
joan , i didn &apos;t know--
tell me , mr. litt ,
did you actually graduate from law school ,
or did you just buy your way onto the letterhead ?
yeah , you better put that bag down ,
because we &apos;re staying all night .
didn &apos;t go well with joan , did it ?
no , it didn &apos;t , because you sandbagged me .
i didn &apos;t sandbag you .
well , then what do you call not telling me
that glamour was circling her board members ?
i tried to tell you ,
but you couldn &apos;t hear me through all of your rage .
what i &apos;m not hearing
is the sound of you putting your bag down ,
because the board members are meeting tomorrow afternoon ,
and i only have until then to fix this .
and you want me to help you ?
you &apos;re the associate on this case , aren &apos;t you ?
so now i &apos;m an associate ?
hey , you know what ?
now is not the time to get into it .
no , now is exactly the time to get into it ,
because you have taken every opportunity possible
to make me feel like i am nothing ,
and now , even though you want something ,
you &apos;re still treating me like i &apos;m nothing .
i &apos;m treating you like every other associate .
that is bullshit , and you know what ?
even if it were true ,
you didn &apos;t used to treat me that way .
i didn &apos;t used to know you lied to me on a daily basis .
louis , it would serve you right
if i take my bag and leave you here
and go home to the man that i love .
so you &apos;re not gonna help .
no , i &apos;m gonna help you ,
but not because you deserve it .
i &apos;ll do it because i am an associate ,
and i am a professional ,
which means i am capable
of putting the personal aside in order to do my job .
and one of those , please .
just what i was in the mood for .
ah , you &apos;re getting a bagel .
that means you kicked ass .
which i did .
you called up the tsa ,
busted up their national security defense ?
no , i used their defense .
gerard &apos;s gonna testify under seal
because it &apos;s a matter of national security .
and the judge bought that ?
what &apos;s not to buy ?
the tsa made the argument for us .
and what did brady say ?
that &apos;s the best part about it .
he doesn &apos;t even know it .
it &apos;s a matter of national security .
we testify under seal ,
the judge realizes that gerard is a degenerate gambler ...
but a fair mediator .
the case gets dismissed , and garrett brady
and harvard law never know it happened .
you thought of all of that on your own ?
you think you &apos;re the only one who can come up
with an intelligent solution ?
you are 1 for 400
in the time we &apos;ve worked together .
okay , smart guy , since i did your job for you ,
you &apos;re gonna do my job for me .
you want me to prep gerard
because you don &apos;t want to sit in a room
and listen to him talk for two hours .
i didn &apos;t want to 15 years ago ,
and i don &apos;t want to now .
we only get one shot at this ,
and his testimony better be rock solid .
thanks .
oh , yeah , sure , help yourself !
dick .
i see you haven &apos;t slept .
i have a lot of work that needs attending to .
i bet you do , considering the phone call
i got from joan walsh this morning .
she called you ?
she wanted to know what the other name partners
were going to do about the one that screwed the pooch .
oh , come on , that is not fair .
i didn &apos;t have all the information--
you had enough information
to make a deal to get her from harvey ,
and part of that deal was you backing me with jeff .
oh , so that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
you don &apos;t trust i &apos;m still gonna do it ?
because you haven &apos;t done it yet ,
and you have a history of making poor decisions
when things aren &apos;t going your way .
the only poor decision i &apos;ve made is agreeing
to cover for you in the first place .
you didn &apos;t think that was such a bad idea
when you were using it to get what you wanted .
and now you &apos;re threatening to take that thing away .
louis , you want to keep joan ,
that &apos;s on you ,
but i held up my end of the bargain .
you better hold up yours .
i just want to go over it one more time , professor .
how much money was in that pot ?
i &apos;m tried of going over it .
why do we have to keep replaying
every moment of this game ?
because your entire case depends on it .
my case depends on the fact that i won that money gambling ,
not whether i won it with a flush .
your case depends on the judge believing you ,
and if he finds any holes in your testimony , then we--
i gave you the names of everyone i knew at that game .
but none of those men were there when you won that money .
i can &apos;t help it if i didn &apos;t get the name of the guy i beat .
which is why your story needs to be rock solid .
okay .
go ahead .
so i ask you again , professor ,
how much money was in the final pot ?
roughly $ 12,000 .
and you won that hand .
as i said before , i won ,
and then i cashed out .
and what did you have again ?
a queen @-@ high flush .
and who did you beat ?
i told you , i didn &apos;t get his name .
okay , so what did he have ?
two pair , queens over sixes .
wait a second .
you said before that the man next to you
folded with two queens up ,
and now this guy has two queens ,
and you had a queen @-@ high flush ?
i said that the man next to me
folded with two kings .
no , you didn &apos;t .
you heard me wrong .
no , i didn &apos;t .
is this part of prepping me ,
or are you accusing me of something ?
i &apos;m trying to get your story to line up .
my story does line up .
not to me , it doesn &apos;t .
look , young man , if you &apos;re gonna sit over there
and call me a liar--
i &apos;m not calling you a liar ,
but if you say tomorrow what you said today ,
we &apos;re gonna be in a lot of trouble ,
because where i come from ,
there are only four queens in a deck .
i said two kings ,
and i &apos;m gonna say that again tomorrow .
so you do your job ,
and i &apos;m gonna do mine .
he &apos;s lying .
what are you talking about ?
gerard &apos;s story about winning all that money
playing poker is bullshit .
all right , slow down . what the hell happened ?
i did the math , and the hands don &apos;t add up .
what do you mean you did the math ?
i mean first he said that he drew a queen on fourth street ,
and then when i pressed him about it , he--
wait a second .
this conclusion is based on him recalling hands
under cross @-@ examination ?
harvey , i got kicked out
of atlantic city for counting cards .
i know this shit .
it doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s lying .
i got a little experience with that too ,
and i &apos;m telling you , he was .
or maybe he &apos;s tired .
or maybe i &apos;m right .
or maybe you don &apos;t know what the hell you &apos;re talking about .
why are you defending him ?
because you asked me to .
look , harvey ,
i &apos;m not saying that he took a bribe .
i &apos;m just saying that he didn &apos;t get that money playing poker .
well , unless he admitted that , he &apos;s testifying tomorrow .
since when do you stick your head in the sand ?
did he admit it ?
no , he didn &apos;t .
but he screwed up the details , and he shouldn &apos;t have ,
because people who are telling the truth get it right .
and you know it .
what &apos;s that ?
jacks full of fours .
i can see that , but why--
why is it staring you in the face ?
it &apos;s what i threw down the last time i won a huge hand .
it was six weeks ago , and i can remember every hand
that every player at that table had .
now , if you won money the other night ,
you &apos;d remember it too .
i do remember ,
and as i explained to your associate--
yeah , stop bullshitting me .
where the hell did that money really come from ?
&apos;cause if you don &apos;t tell me the truth ,
i &apos;m canceling that hearing right now .
it came ...
from a student of mine .
for what ?
in exchange for changing his grade .
jesus christ . for $ 25,000 ?
he was going to fail my class ,
and that would &apos;ve stopped him from getting an offer from--
you goddamn hypocrite .
you preach about ethics , and you do this ?
this is about ethics .
and you don &apos;t have any idea why i did it .
i don &apos;t care why you did it .
i care about what you &apos;re making me do ,
because i am not suborning perjury .
well , you tell me that you &apos;ve never done anything worse .
i knew it .
you would do it for someone else ...
but not for me .
you know what , professor ?
there &apos;s a small part of me that actually thought
that you came to me because you thought i &apos;m the best ,
but you just think i &apos;ll do whatever it takes to win .
isn &apos;t that what makes you the best ?
get someone else to do your dirty work ,
because i &apos;m not suborning perjury .
what are you doing ?
getting my blood flowing .
i &apos;ve been sitting here all night ,
and restless leg syndrome kills 14 people every hour .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s accurate .
i don &apos;t care what you think . what do you have ?
i found a way to fix things with joan .
okay , you &apos;re arguing anything in r &amp; d
is the intellectual property
of the person who suggested the product ?
until such time that the results become public .
which they did the second i sent the board that letter .
except board members are subject
to the nondisclosure agreement .
well , the board members haven &apos;t signed
a nondisclosure agreement .
yet .
what &apos;s to stop them from refusing ?
nothing , but if they do ,
then the noncompete kicks in .
preventing them from revealing the contents of my letter
under threat of prosecution .
specifically corporate espionage .
oh , my god . you got this idea from--
our bylaws .
my bylaws .
rachel , holy shit , this is ...
acceptable .
i think the word you &apos;re looking for is &quot; awesome . &quot;
well , the word i &apos;m saying is , &quot; get out ,
because i have a meeting to prepare for . &quot;
you know what , louis ? i have been working all night .
and this gets your ass out of a major sling ,
so instead of dismissing me ,
you should be asking me to come with you .
excuse me , miss professional .
you wanted me to treat you like every other associate .
now i am .
by acting as if i did nothing ?
no , by acknowledging you did acceptable work .
letting you come with me is something
that i would only do for you if we were friends ,
which we are not .
you canceled the hearing .
you were right .
he was lying .
i &apos;m sorry .
you know , i knew he was a hypocrite
after i found out about the gambling .
i never thought he &apos;d sell out harvard .
what are you talking about ?
he did take the bribe ,
but it had nothing to do with the accident victims .
he did it to change someone &apos;s grade .
why would he do that ?
what difference does it make ?
either way , he was gonna let me suborn perjury .
it makes a difference because we still have to win this case .
oh , i don &apos;t give a shit about winning this case .
i &apos;ve never heard you say anything like that before .
you--you care about winning every case ,
every game , every argument .
did you hear me ?
he was gonna let me suborn perjury .
and so would every client you have
if they thought they &apos;d get away with it .
he &apos;s not every client .
no , he &apos;s the one you hated in the first place .
i didn &apos;t hate him .
harvey , what is going on here ?
i thought he was better than us .
i sat in that class and listened to him talk
about what kind of lawyers we should be ,
and i always let him down because i knew
that wasn &apos;t the kind of lawyer that wins .
and i wanted to win .
so i &apos;d argue with him ,
and he &apos;d look down on me .
and now instead of you letting him down ,
he let you down .
he turned out to be no better than any of us .
so then let &apos;s make him better than us .
miss walsh .
you are not on my schedule today .
ah , ah , miss walsh , please take a look at this .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a chance to make things right .
you cannot call board members employees
based on them having access to an expense account .
not just an expense account .
they have corporate cards and standing offices ,
which , as defined by section 14.2
of the internal revenue code ,
makes them employees .
well , mr. litt ,
seems i won &apos;t be demanding a new point person after all .
i &apos;m glad to hear that .
are you ?
of course i am .
you &apos;re my first client as name partner .
you &apos;re very important to me .
well , i suppose we &apos;ll find out the truth
when someone else makes name partner .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m not an idiot .
i know that no one in your firm wants to deal with me .
that &apos;s not true .
in fact , i fought for you .
you may have thought you were fighting for me ,
but i know that jessica dumped me on harvey ,
and it seems that the second you made name partner ,
harvey did the same thing to you .
oh , you didn &apos;t know that , did you ?
then maybe we were meant for each other ,
since we &apos;re both left out of the club .
you betrayed me .
you make this big speech about repairing our friendship ,
and all it was more words .
what are you talking about ?
you convinced me to take joan ,
while conveniently leaving out the fact
you &apos;re doing harvey a favor .
that &apos;s not why i did it , louis .
well , just tell me right now , can he stand her ?
no , but he was gonna keep her
because you--
hurt his precious feelings . i know .
i felt so awful about that .
you know what , louis ? you should .
and while you &apos;re at it , you should feel pretty awful
about being a dick to me right now .
you lied to me again .
no , louis . i fought for you ... again .
no .
you made joan sound important .
&quot; the first client that jessica gave harvey
when he made name partner . &quot;
she is important , louis , but you can &apos;t see that
because you didn &apos;t want a client .
you just wanted to take something away from harvey .
what i want is respect .
then get out of your own way
and get on the goddamn team .
you mean the team that kept mike &apos;s secret from me ?
no , louis !
i mean the team that protected its own ,
because that &apos;s what teams do .
and , you know , i shouldn &apos;t even be telling you this
because she wasn &apos;t going to ,
but if you need a little bit more evidence
of what we do for each other ,
then take a look at rachel ,
because she got katrina a job .
what ?
that &apos;s right .
your former associate ,
and you &apos;ve been treating rachel like shit .
so , if you &apos;re done yelling at me ,
then i suggest you go fix one of the thousand things
that you have screwed up lately ,
because the rest of us , we are done fighting for you .
mr. ross .
ah , you must be ian .
and , please , don &apos;t call me mr. ross .
mike is fine .
ah , sure .
hey , thanks for your call , mike .
pearson specter is a great firm .
ah , well , you &apos;re a great candidate .
i &apos;m a little curious why you &apos;re still interviewing .
i heard you had a solid offer at skadden .
i do , but skadden arps is no pearson specter .
are you sure it &apos;s not because
you &apos;re worried they &apos;ll find out that you failed
professor gerard &apos;s legal ethics class ?
what ?
oh , shit .
you don &apos;t know .
he hasn &apos;t changed your grade ,
but he still has your $ 25,000 .
who the hell are you ?
i &apos;m exactly who i said i was .
the only thing i left out is that
professor gerard is my client .
well , he can &apos;t be in trouble for this .
i &apos;d know .
he &apos;s not .
he &apos;s being accused of accepting a bribe
while conducting a federal mediation
because of this .
that &apos;s not my problem .
it &apos;s your problem now ,
which is why you &apos;re gonna sign this .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a sworn affidavit
stating the money that you paid gerard is a loan .
well , what happens to my grade ?
it stays the same because henry gerard
doesn &apos;t take money to change grades .
that &apos;s bullshit . we had a deal .
yeah , well , consider this your first lesson in the real world .
deals change .
i don &apos;t care what world it is .
i &apos;m not signing anything .
that &apos;s too bad ,
because the truth will come out .
and this way , you &apos;re failing a class
instead of getting thrown out of school
for bribing a professor .
it &apos;s up to you , ian .
you want an f ,
or do you want to not have a legal career at all ?
so i sign this , and the bribery allegations are gone ?
and no one ever knows a thing .
but i still have to pay ian back the money .
that &apos;s the way loans work .
you say that like i am a monster .
i say it like it &apos;s true .
you know ...
you never let me tell you what the money was for .
you didn &apos;t listen to me when i told you i don &apos;t care .
who &apos;s the monster now ?
i don &apos;t care because you always said
the circumstances don &apos;t matter .
well , do you care that after mike grilled me ,
i was so impressed with him
that i wonder why i &apos;d forgotten him .
so i looked through my old records ,
just to see how he did ,
but i couldn &apos;t find any record of him
ever being in my class .
just like they &apos;re not gonna find any record
of you accepting a bribe from a student .
you saying we &apos;re even ?
i &apos;m saying you got a two @-@ for @-@ one ,
because they &apos;re also not gonna find any record
of you gambling last year .
that &apos;s why you came to see me back then , isn &apos;t it ?
you didn &apos;t want anyone to find out about him .
i &apos;m not gonna tell you why i came
to see you last year , henry ,
because the circumstances don &apos;t matter .
you really did pay attention in my class .
a lot more than you think .
i &apos;m sorry i let you down , mr. specter .
professor ...
don &apos;t worry about paying back that loan .
i got it .
louis ...
what can i do for you ?
the question isn &apos;t what you can do for me , jeff ,
but it &apos;s a matter of what you &apos;re gonna do ,
which is cut the bullshit right now .
what ?
you heard me .
i know jessica told you about hardman .
yeah , she did tell me ,
and i have refrained from coming to see you
about blackmailing her out of courtesy .
courtesy ?
you haven &apos;t so much as wished me a congratulations .
you want me to kiss the ring , louis ,
after what you did ?
you &apos;re damn right i do ,
because i don &apos;t care how it got up there .
my name is on that wall .
and if i had a crowbar handy ...
i would pry it off .
well , jeff , you don &apos;t .
so the question you got to ask yourself is ,
&quot; do you want to stick with the team ? &quot;
because my name is up there to stay
whether you like it or not .
thanks for meeting me .
what &apos;s going on ?
i wanted to thank you for making me take gerard .
what happened ?
what makes you think something happened ?
because i know you ,
and i know you don &apos;t have moments of self @-@ reflection ,
let alone have a drink with someone to tell them about it
unless something happened .
you know what ? something did happen .
i dealt with some shit ,
and i &apos;m trying to thank you for it
because it turned out to be a good thing .
i think the word you &apos;re looking for is &quot; closure . &quot;
that &apos;s your word .
the word i &apos;m looking for is ,
&quot; you &apos;re welcome , harvey .
that &apos;s nice of you to say . &quot;
thanks , harvey .
good .
now listen to me .
for a minute there , i thought
you were gonna tell me that he knows .
what ?
maybe i &apos;m crazy ,
but when i was prepping him , for a second , he looked at me ,
and i thought ,
&quot; he &apos;s suspicious . &quot;
and then you called ,
and after everything that &apos;s happened already , i--
it &apos;s fine , mike . he doesn &apos;t know .
