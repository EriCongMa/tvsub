you gotta be kidding me .
that &apos;s my spot .
i don &apos;t see your name on it .
you cut me off .
you got a problem ?
your car in my spot .
what are you gonna do about it ?
come on . don &apos;t be an asshole .
what did you call me ?
you heard me .
what &apos;s wrong ?
what happened ?
hello ?
surprise !
presenting ...
the president of the new england medical officers --
dr. maura isles .
well , technically , i &apos;m the president @-@ elect .
congratulations , president @-@ elect .
wait ! no , ma ! it &apos;s gonna go everywhere .
please . this is not my first rodeo .
i just got elected . how do you all know about this ?
oh , they called to ask how to engrave the plaque ,
and i had to tell someone .
so she told me , and i told ...
everyone .
of course he did .
after all , she &apos;s the new england ...
what is it ?
it &apos;s an ethics commitee .
they review and they publish cases of interest
to the medical community at large .
and dr. isles is the first president @-@ elect
in the field of forensic pathology .
yes , and the first whose patients are all dead .
well , we used to be the outcasts of the medical community .
not long ago , a medical degree wasn &apos;t even required
to be certified , so ...
this is a really big deal .
and n.e.m.o. is very lucky to have you .
wait .
nemo ?
oh , no relation to the vengeful submarine captain
with a bitter hatred for british imperialism .
why is everyone looking at me like that ?
oh , nemo &apos;s the little striped clown fish .
with the tiny , tiny fin .
jack , tell me i &apos;m not alone .
i might &apos;ve read it in high school ?
oh , come on . who cares ?
this is a party , not a book report .
to you , maura !
cheers .
cheers .
mmm ! cake !
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine . why ?
you just downed that like somebody was chasing you .
oh . um ... it &apos;s delicious .
oh , we need a cake knife .
scalpels are clean .
oh , wait . whoa . whoa .
i am all up for dead people getting props ,
but i draw the line at autopsy tools .
ma , back me up on this .
whoa ! what i could do to a pork chop with these things .
rizzoli .
okay , i &apos;ll just , uh , take this to the fridge .
not the morgue fridge .
that goes anywhere near a person with a toe tag , i &apos;ll know it .
i understand .
i &apos;m watching you , chang .
the morgue fridge is the only place big enough to fit this cake .
dead men tell no tales .
so can i call you captain nemo or not ?
not .
well , i have to call you something .
i got it . captain morgan .
i &apos;m not sure a pirate theme
is in line with the committee &apos;s mission .
no , i &apos;m very sure they &apos;re anti @-@ scurvy .
when kind of grades do you think a pirate would make
in medical school ?
please don &apos;t .
high seas .
why didn &apos;t the pirate go to the movie ?
&apos;cause it was rated arrrr !
how do i make it stop ?
you can &apos;t ! i haven &apos;t even gotten to the booty jokes yet .
somehow , i &apos;m gonna make jack pay for this .
you guys all right ?
he didn &apos;t look like a very jolly roger back there .
i didn &apos;t notice . but then i was distracted .
by your reflection in the shiny , shiny plaque ? no , i get it .
thank you , by the way .
i couldn &apos;t do this work without you .
my pleas @-@ arrrr .
that was a stretch . walk the plank .
hey , what do we got ?
ned drake . 32 . married .
owns a carpet cleaning business on the other side of town .
witnesses saw him arguing with another driver
right before he dropped dead .
road rage ?
except no one saw the other driver raise a gun .
significant tissue loss around the entrance wound .
went clean through him .
we recover the bullet ?
not yet .
the other driver is jay clark .
he admits to stealing ned &apos;s spot , exchanging words ,
but that &apos;s it .
claims he doesn &apos;t own a gun , says he &apos;s a pacifist .
we &apos;re looking for places where he could &apos;ve ditched the gun .
trash cans , storm drains .
but no one heard a shot either .
so witnesses saw the argument , they saw him drop dead ,
but nobody saw a gun or heard a shot ?
that &apos;s what we have .
well , he is shot , right , maura ?
he wasn &apos;t run through with a spear or something ?
well , i &apos;ll need to autopsy to confirm the cause of death ,
but these wounds are consistent with a gunshot , yes .
drive @-@ by maybe ? stray bullet ?
it &apos;s possible .
maybe wrong place at the wrong time ?
then again , people will do anything for a good parking spot .
so we tried to call ned &apos;s wife to notify her of his death ,
but her cell phone was in his car .
oh ?
yeah .
turns out she forgot it on her way to work this morning .
he was bringing it to her .
well , that &apos;s nice of him .
oh , but if she hadn &apos;t forgotten it , then ...
he wouldn &apos;t have been there .
did you find anything ?
well , c.s.r.u. hasn &apos;t recovered a bullet .
uh , but the dimensions of the entrance and exit wounds
suggest a high velocity , large caliber bullet .
what , like a rifle ?
i can &apos;t speculate what it was ,
but i can eliminate the handgun family .
what about a shotgun slug ?
bullets in a large game hunting caliber
would &apos;ve caused more extensive damage .
i can &apos;t imagine our truck driver whipping out a rifle
in the middle of an argument .
and based on the angle of the wound track ,
i think that your pacifist truck driver was telling the truth .
what do you mean ?
the bullet entered just above his heart
and exited between anterior ribs five and six .
which means the bullet traveled down instead of straight through .
which means it was likely fired
from a position above street level .
how far above ?
well , knowing the distance that the bullet traveled
would allow me to determine the angle by degree .
but without it , i can only say
that the shot was fired from above .
so unless my truck driver was on stilts , i &apos;m out of suspects .
hey , that &apos;s mine . get outta here .
no . it is my spot .
okay , when did our crime scene become an improve class ?
if i look through ned &apos;s eyes , i may see what we missed .
all right , well , try to stay alive long enough
to help me track the shot .
lots of windows .
well , the uniforms are going door @-@ to @-@ door .
maybe somebody has a problem with ned we don &apos;t know about .
windows would allow for height , but they &apos;re too close
based on the angle of the wound track .
yeah . the shot was fired from farther away .
care for a walk in the park ?
oh , i &apos;d love to .
wait .
streamers .
wind indicators for long @-@ range hunting .
any one of these trees has an unobstructed view of the street .
that &apos;s the one .
camouflage climbing pegs .
branches are perfect for a perch .
yeah , and the distance from the street
explains why no one heard a shot .
it &apos;s a sniper &apos;s nest .
ned &apos;s death wasn &apos;t an accident . it was a cold @-@ blooded execution .
all right , thanks .
c.s.r.u. says the area &apos;s swept clean .
they couldn &apos;t even get a boot print .
professional .
could be . but who orders a hit on ned ?
well , just because it &apos;s a professional killer
doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s a professional hit .
ned wasn &apos;t even supposed to be here .
professional killer , random target ?
don &apos;t say the &quot; r &quot; word . it &apos;s bad for morale .
somebody lives here .
or used to .
urine .
explains why the k @-@ 9s are all worked up .
hey , hey , hey . look at this .
sniper streamers .
i bet that &apos;s our missing shell casing .
yep .
large caliber .
perfect for long @-@ range shooting .
nice job , officer .
oh , hey !
they &apos;re not hiding behind you with more champagne , are they ?
just me .
well , i hope you &apos;re here to make up for
the car ride &apos;s worth of pirate jokes
that i was subject to ... in traffic .
pirates ?
never mind .
what &apos;s up ?
i ... have some news .
bad news ?
uh , great , actually . for my ex @-@ wife , anyway .
she &apos;s been offered a job with nasa
on the r &amp; d team for the latest jupiter probe .
she must be thrilled .
it &apos;s a job of a lifetime .
she &apos;s gonna be running the albuquerque facility .
new mexico .
yeah .
our custody agreement requires my consent
for her to move allie . i could object , but ...
i hate to get in the way of such an amazing opportunity .
now i &apos;m working on options --
visiting her in albuquerque ,
having her come here for holidays .
but look ,
i don &apos;t want this to hang over us .
i &apos;m gonna make it work out .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i &apos;m sure it is .
the lab &apos;s processing the shell casing .
there &apos;s plenty of prints around the encampment .
so far , no match .
nina , could you generate a list
of current and ex @-@ military snipers in the area ?
could be a loose canon using civilians for target practice .
give me a few minutes .
if the guy &apos;s military , his prints would be on file .
that den didn &apos;t belong to our sniper .
whoever lived there just had the casing and the streamers
for some reason .
maybe he had a partner . a lookout ?
possible , but atypical .
snipers like to work alone .
just their god complexes keeping them company .
what worries me is that
the typical sniper doesn &apos;t stop after one victim .
you get something off the shell casing ?
it &apos;s standard . winchester .
.30 @-@ 06 . factory made .
available everywhere .
no matching print , i &apos;m guessing .
unfortunately .
but it &apos;s the gunpowder that i wanted to talk to you about .
i found a chemical additive
that might &apos;ve been mixed in by the manufacturer .
yeah , a tag .
so it can be traced if it &apos;s used in a bomb .
i &apos;ll send it to a.t.f.
they keep track of tags here and abroad .
there &apos;s been another shooting at a park .
same m.o. as our sniper ?
yeah , looks that way .
yep .
that looks just like the first nest .
the victim was jeremy fritz .
54 . stockbroker .
he was walking to a physical therapy appointment when he got shot .
does he live nearby ?
no , but he works right around the corner .
he was on his lunch break .
well , anything that makes him a likely target ?
well , not according to his coworkers .
seems like a good guy .
just like ned ?
no , not like ned . jeremy fritz is still alive .
the bullet hit him in the shoulder . he &apos;s in surgery .
when can we talk to him ?
soon as the doctor gives his okay .
okay . in the meantime , let &apos;s --
let &apos;s check into these two victims .
you think there &apos;s a reason why these guys were targeted ?
i hope so .
if they went to the same barber or had the same birthday ,
maybe that means something .
i &apos;ll get nina on it .
we &apos;ll start looking for a connection right away .
look at this , right there in the bushes .
boston police ! freeze !
go ! go ! cover the east !
tell them we got a suspect ...
south side of the park !
stop !
what &apos;s your name ? what are you doing out here ?
did he just try to bite you ?
yeah .
we have your fingerprints on a shell casing
connected to the murder of ned drake .
did you help the shooter ? were you his lookout ?
we also have your prints on a roll of streamers
used in both shootings .
we can help you , okay ? but you have to talk to us .
kid , come on . you gotta explain this .
he &apos;s got no i.d. , fingerprints aren &apos;t in the system ,
and nothing showed up in missing persons .
so in lieu of an actual name ,
we &apos;re calling him mcgruff .
like the crime dog ?
well , it &apos;s better than buster .
or spot .
he just seems too erratic
to work with someone as methodical as the shooter .
yeah , i thought the same thing ,
which leaves us with drugs or ...
cray @-@ cray .
this is interesting .
a few minutes ago , he was about to rip out korsak &apos;s jugular .
now he &apos;s a bored kid in study hall ?
what happened ?
the behavior is defensive .
he &apos;s relaxed when the perceived threat is gone .
or when he thinks no one &apos;s watching .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s an act .
i have a theory , but i &apos;ll have to test it
before i can make a diagnosis .
i &apos;m going to need a cheeseburger .
we &apos;ll search the park in quadrants .
look for places he could hide materials to build nests ,
or any evidence of any new nests under construction .
we &apos;re checking traffic cameras ,
but we think our guy was hiding in plain sight .
this guy built nests and hung streamers .
nobody noticed a thing .
so how &apos;d he blend in ?
see if any park employees or sanitation workers
have reported missing uniforms ,
if any regular park visitors
heard or seen anything unusual near the nests .
we need to know if the victims &apos; locations
had anything in common .
are there any chain stores ,
restaurants , or banks that are near both areas ?
the sniper might &apos;ve had a cause ,
and the shootings are his way of drawing attention to his message .
i &apos;ll be here for a while if you have any questions .
any news on jeremy fritz ?
bullet caused severe vascular damage .
he &apos;ll be in surgery at least another six hours .
what &apos;s the connection between ned drake and jeremy fritz ?
they &apos;re both men ,
shot near the park .
that &apos;s it so far .
you &apos;re joking .
jeremy fritz is a highly successful 54 @-@ year @-@ old stockbroker .
his office overlooks the west side of franklin park .
and ned drake has an office
over a chinese restaurant in dorchester .
they never called the same number .
they had no friends or business dealings in common .
they didn &apos;t go to stores or restaurants
in each other &apos;s neighborhoods .
he &apos;s picking the victims at random ?
looks that way so far .
which means studying the victims won &apos;t tell us anything .
then we refocus on the sniper himself . what do we know ?
that &apos;s what i wanted to tell you . the a.t.f. called .
the chemical tags in the gunpowder residue
are from a german company that makes high @-@ end powder
for ... custom reloaders ?
they create unique mixes of powder
and make special order ammunition .
i &apos;ll look for local reloaders
that buy from the german company .
and we &apos;ll need a list of the reloaders &apos; clients .
when i get their names , i &apos;ll cross @-@ reference addresses
within a 2 @-@ mile radius of franklin park .
let &apos;s hope it amounts to something . come on .
hi .
my name is maura .
i just came to sit with you , if that &apos;s all right .
are you hungry ?
your hand looks like it hurts .
i &apos;m a doctor . i can help if you let me .
it must be hard to find enough food to eat in the park .
i see you understand english .
that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m here if there &apos;s anything you wanna tell me .
like how you got hurt .
the hunter .
he hurt you .
how did you know he was a hunter ?
g @-@ gun .
did he give you the shell casing and the streamers ,
or did you take them ? that &apos;s okay .
okay , we don &apos;t have to talk about him if you don &apos;t want to .
okay ? we can just start at the beginning .
can you tell me your name ?
at least you got him to talk .
well , he might never talk again after that .
then we &apos;ll try pizza .
chicken wings ?
the food wasn &apos;t a bribe .
i wanted to observe his manner of eating .
like an animal .
exactly .
you know , i think he has clinical lycanthropy ,
usually brought on by schizophrenia
or a psychotic break .
do i need a tattoo on my forehead
that says &quot; what does
that mean , maura ? &quot;
oh . i assumed you were just shocked into silence
because his condition is so rare .
nope !
less than 1 % of the population
suffers from split personality schizophrenia ,
and less than 1 % of that group
fits the criteria for this diagnosis .
which is what ?
the word &quot; lycanthrope &quot; is derived
from the greek term meaning &quot; werewolf . &quot;
the subject &apos;s doglike behavior
is due to his belief that --
hold up .
okay , you were speaking rather quickly there ,
but i &apos;m fairly confident you said the word &quot; werewolf . &quot;
i did .
he does not .
he might .
this is my shocked face .
it looks like your &quot; i smell pickles &quot; face .
why would i make this face when i smell pickles ?
i love pickles -- okay !
what you &apos;re telling me
is that mcgruff thinks he can turn into a wolf .
teeth , claws , the whole business ?
that &apos;s correct .
when his condition is activated ,
he experiences delusions and hallucinations
that make him believe he is an animal .
in this case , a subspecies of genus canis called canis lupus .
okay , well , he said that he was hurt by a hunter ,
which is most likely our sniper .
that makes him an eyewitness ,
who thinks he &apos;s a wolf .
nobody &apos;s perfect .
mcgruff is the only lead we &apos;ve got .
there must be a way to get a coherent statement out of him .
possibly after several weeks of intensive treatment .
okay , well , we don &apos;t have time for that .
he &apos;s not a -- he &apos;s not a patient yet , right ?
technically , no , until i call
forensic mental health services .
hold on . patient ?
are you guys buying into this kid &apos;s wolverine act ?
come on .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s faking .
he &apos;s been living in a urine @-@ soaked den in the park
for at least two weeks .
he told you that ?
or did he bark his way through a game of charades ?
i checked the records . calls about a growling man
stealing people &apos;s food in the park
started a few weeks ago .
yeah . the smell alone ...
it &apos;s a very long , smelly con . it seems unlikely .
all right .
so the only person who can i.d. our sniper bays at the moon .
terrific . how &apos;s that gonna hold up ?
how do we keep this kid out of the psych ward ?
we need to avoid aggravating his condition .
so we keep him calm , he doesn &apos;t wolf @-@ out .
give him as many cheeseburgers as he wants .
and that should buy us some time .
let &apos;s hope it &apos;s enough .
turns out custom reloaders are very cooperative people ...
after i threatened them with a warrant
to seize all their chemicals
to search for unregistered tags .
nice work .
these people all buy custom gunpowder ?
these are members of clubs
where our shooter &apos;s gunpowder is sold .
don &apos;t they keep transaction records ?
they do for bullets but not gunpowder .
it &apos;s gonna take us days
to run full checks on every one of &apos; em .
we don &apos;t have that kind of time .
pull driver &apos;s license photos on all these people .
maybe the wolf kid can pick one out of the pack .
you said &quot; pack . &quot;
you get it , right ?
i &apos;m laughing on the inside .
i didn &apos;t know you were gonna stop by .
i @-@ i feel like i handed you a pile of ...
anxiety and indecision and just walked away .
not cool .
it &apos;s a lot to process .
i &apos;ve done some thinking .
i think i &apos;ve got an option that might work .
and now that i have some actual details ,
i thought it &apos;d be appropriate to share with you
so we can work through it together .
why are you looking at me like that ?
i love when you say mature things .
well , i am a grown man .
you are , and that &apos;s very rare .
and incredibly disappointing to my gender as a whole .
i &apos;m gonna have to bring that up at our next meeting .
so you said you figured out a plan .
yes . i talked to n.m.u. ,
and they have an opening for a full @-@ time professor .
that &apos;s great .
it isn &apos;t ?
that would mean relocating full @-@ time .
but they also have room for an adjunct professor ,
which would allow me to live and work part @-@ time in boston .
but then you &apos;d be walking away going to a tenure track job
and you would only be seeing allie part of the year .
if we &apos;re gonna make this work ,
we &apos;re all gonna have to make sacrifices .
do you disagree ?
all i know is i ...
i don &apos;t wanna lose you .
sorry .
it &apos;s jane . i have to get back to this case .
of course .
but i don &apos;t wanna leave things like this .
maura , if we both want the same thing ,
it &apos;s gonna work out fine .
we &apos;ll solve this together .
right . together .
wait . sorry .
i gotta call you back .
uniform searching in franklin park
just found a third sniper &apos;s nest .
same as the first two ?
pegs in the trunk , perch in the branches .
well , let &apos;s go .
there &apos;s gotta be a connection between these nests .
if we find his pattern , we &apos;ll find the guy .
hey . did you get my text ?
you said you were coming down .
yeah , and then i said , &quot; scratch that .
i need you to come upstairs and talk to teen wolf . &quot;
well , after that ,
it &apos;s just variations of &quot; where the hell are you ? &quot;
these emoticons don &apos;t deserve to be used in such disturbing ways .
gets the point across , doesn &apos;t it ?
how is he ?
he &apos;s sleeping .
but we just found a third sniper &apos;s nest ,
and he &apos;s the only witness we have ,
so we gotta get in there and talk to him .
well , i know , but the subject of the hunter
triggers his fear response , and you saw what happened .
yeah . kaboom . wolf @-@ nado .
somehow that &apos;s exactly right .
all right , so how &apos;d you get him to talk ?
was it the cheeseburger ? i think it was more my sympathy .
for his hand ?
well , not just that ,
but also the suffering that he endures because of his condition .
you know , maybe if i indulge his delusion
and show compassion for his experience of
being a man who turns into a wolf ,
he might feel safe enough
to endure talking about the hunter
and not trigger his fear response .
great ! do that upstairs .
all the nests are within 300 yards of streets .
two commercial , one residential . no pattern there .
the other two were in busy areas .
this one has less foot traffic .
looks like the nest locations
are just as random as the victims .
there &apos;s gotta be--
here &apos;s a photo from the nest .
thank you .
bring up the pictures of the second nest .
yeah . the one where he shot fritz .
there &apos;s only one streamer in the second nest .
maybe he only had time to hang one ,
or the others fell off .
no , this guy plans everything to a tee .
if he wanted to use three streamers , he would have .
what &apos;s the difference between one and three ?
with three streamers , the shooter picks his target ,
checks the closest streamer for wind factor ,
makes the shot .
for one streamer to be useful ,
he &apos;s gotta know the exact location of his target .
the sniper knew when jeremy fritz would be at that exact spot .
all the other shootings were just to throw us off .
fritz was the sniper &apos;s primary target .
if you &apos;ll let me , i &apos;d like to take a look at your hand .
i can help it feel better .
may i take a look at your hand ?
it &apos;s sprained very badly .
here .
this will help it heal faster
and it won &apos;t hurt all the time .
okay ?
must be hard to live in the park .
hungry .
is that how you ... you met the hunter ?
you were looking for food ?
he came at night
to make the trees .
did you ever see him in the daylight ?
he had a gun .
did you -- did you see him with a gun just one time ?
you saw him with a gun twice ?
and the second time you saw him ,
you knew what he was going to do , didn &apos;t you ?
tried to ...
stop him in the tree .
you climbed up in the tree after the hunter ?
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s really brave .
he pushed me out .
he hit me more .
you can help us stop him for good . do you wanna do that ?
i know you &apos;ve been hurt ,
but you &apos;re safe with me .
okay ?
i &apos;m not afraid of you . i know that you wanna help .
now tell me what else you remember about the hunter .
he loud .
copper .
wet .
okay . thanks .
jeremy fritz is out of surgery , but he &apos;s in recovery .
the doctor still won &apos;t give us the okay to talk to him .
all right . what about his routine ? what do we know ?
he goes to work every day at the same time .
on tuesdays ,
he goes to physical therapy during his lunch hour .
where is that ?
here . two blocks north of the park .
and walking distance from his office .
so once a week at lunch ,
jeremy fritz stands on the same street corner .
it was the perfect plan , but he missed .
wolf kid said he got into the tree with the hunter .
words he used to describe the guy were &quot; copper &quot; and &quot; wet . &quot;
what if he was describing blood ?
you think he bit the sniper ?
could &apos;ve . thrown the shot off , saved jeremy &apos;s life .
drivers &apos; license photos
of people who had access to the tagged gunpowder
and also live or work near the park .
get these to jane and have her run &apos; em by the kid .
maybe it &apos;ll spark something .
let &apos;s hope he bites with his eyes open .
i got your text . he needs a c.a.t. scan ?
i think his condition could be the result of
a tumor on his hypothalamus ,
which is part of the brain that detects changes in the body .
it &apos;s potentially life @-@ threatening .
i had to bring him in .
and we were hoping he &apos;d get a look at these photos .
well , he &apos;s just sedated for the test .
i &apos;m sure if you come back later ,
he &apos;ll be alert enough to go through them .
i &apos;m sorry , jane . i really had no choice .
no . of course . of course .
what &apos;s this ?
well , the sniper doesn &apos;t know
that he isn &apos;t a reliable witness .
as far as he knows , this is the only person
who can tie him to the shootings .
which makes him a target .
yes , it does .
stay with him no matter what .
thanks , jane .
dr. reddick , radiology . dr. reddick , radiology .
yeah . thanks .
jeremy fritz picked out three of the people
from the driver &apos;s license photos ,
but they all have alibis .
any of them have connections to fritz or his family ?
nope .
and i think the painkillers aren &apos;t helping much .
well , maybe a doped up victim is less helpful
than the wolf kid .
if maura can turn him into a reliable witness ,
he might be all we need .
it &apos;s called a c.a.t. scan .
they &apos;re gonna take a picture of your insides .
does it hurt ?
not at all .
it looks like a doughnut ,
and you &apos;re gonna go through the doughnut hole on the table .
you come , too .
you &apos;ll hear my voice the entire time .
hey , it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re all right . you &apos;re all right .
no , no . stop . he &apos;s not trying to hurt me .
what is scaring you ? what are you -- - you , run !
run !
okay , get him into a room and lock the door !
jane , i think the sniper tracked us to the hospital .
he &apos;s here .
all right , i &apos;ll turn around .
i &apos;ll be there in five .
maura , i &apos;m here . tell me exactly where you are .
east atrium , fifth floor . i think he &apos;s going down .
okay , frankie &apos;s on his way with backup .
what does this guy look like ?
tall , dark hair , jeans , a @-@ and jacket .
be right there .
excuse me . oh !
don &apos;t ... you ... move .
you all right ?
he &apos;s got a laceration
in his right quadricep .
and you &apos;re holding a scalpel .
remind me not to piss you off .
piedmont . westley junior .
prints brought up a lot of arrests ,
but not too many charges .
his family politically connected ? just rich .
westley &apos;s father always got him out of trouble ,
everything from plagiarism to arson .
great parenting .
now his kid &apos;s graduated to murder and attempted murder .
why did he target jeremy fritz ?
daddy &apos;s latest move was to get westley jr. a job
at fritz &apos;s investment firm .
piedmont worked for fritz ?
for about five minutes . fritz fired him a month ago .
he didn &apos;t think he should mention
a disgruntled ex @-@ employee ?
maybe fritz didn &apos;t realize he was disgruntled .
he also didn &apos;t know that this job
was westley &apos;s last chance .
or what ? daddy takes his allowance away ?
this guy never worked for anything his whole life ...
except for one notable skill .
marksmanship .
he was the captain of the rifle club
at his prep school .
he was gonna kill his boss
along with a couple of innocent people
just to make us think it was random .
if i &apos;ve said it once , i &apos;ve said it a hundred times --
sociopaths always underestimate
the resilience of the werewolf .
a benign tumor near your brain stem
is causing your condition .
but once the doctors remove it ...
no more wolf .
no more wolf .
smart doctor .
maura .
there are a lot of other smart people
working really hard to help you .
they found a missing persons report
that matched your description .
but it took a while
because you went missing in new hampshire ,
and your family is from hartford .
your name is michael lyons .
you &apos;re a student at u.n.h.
michael .
you were taking the bus home
and you got kicked off in boston .
we &apos;ve contacted your family , and they &apos;re on their way .
thank you , maura .
maura .
how are you ?
good .
i feel like i know what you &apos;re gonna say ,
and it starts with &quot; i &apos;ve been thinking . &quot;
i have .
about human cell division .
okay , strike that . i have no idea what you &apos;re gonna say .
it &apos;s really very fascinating .
okay . go on .
well , the way the chromosomes just line up just so .
and then , when the time &apos;s right ,
they &apos;re pulled apart by a force beyond their control .
and then they go on
to thrive as new , entirely separate entities .
how reassuring .
did you know that these newly divided cells
are actually called daughter cells ?
separation is inevitable .
is that what you &apos;re trying to tell me ?
not for you and allie .
you can &apos;t be so far away from her ,
not even part @-@ time .
these years are so precious ,
and i can &apos;t ask you to miss
not one moment of your daughter &apos;s life .
that would be my decision .
the burden of knowing
that i was the reason that you weren &apos;t there for her ...
it would kill me .
and eventually , that would ... that would kill us .
so the net effect is the same whether i stay or go .
not for allie .
so ...
this is good @-@ bye .
i &apos;m glad you said it , because i can &apos;t .
so he &apos;ll make a full recovery . no more wolf .
if you ask me ,
that wolf situation was a lucky break .
you wanna field this one ?
well , it is true that ,
if michael hadn &apos;t been living like an animal in the park ,
he wouldn &apos;t have been there to witness the shooting .
the sniper would &apos;ve killed at least three people ,
and he would &apos;ve walked like that guy in the movie .
here we go .
that guy with the limp ?
come on . you know .
keyser soze ?
yes , thank you ! thank you !
okay , you two don &apos;t stay up too late .
and jane , you know when you &apos;re too tired , you get that ...
twitch ?
yeah .
thanks , ma .
love ya .
love you too .
are you ok ?
allie &apos;s relationship with her father is more important than mine .
and is that making us feel better now ?
not at the moment , no .
look , maura .
you were given that plaque
because you put others before yourself .
okay ?
and yes , i &apos;m sure at the pearly gates
virtue will be rewarded , but ...
right now , virtue kind of sucks .
being a grown up sucks .
i &apos;ll drink to that .
you &apos;re right .
yes .
no way , &apos; cause ...
it &apos; on ma .
and korsak .
here &apos;s to ...
being adult .
it sucks .
yes , it does .
