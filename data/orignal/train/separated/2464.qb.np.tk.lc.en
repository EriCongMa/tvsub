what was the deal with you and stefan ?
i was the first love of stefan &apos;s life .
stefan , meet julian .
does stefan salvatore know that you are
pregnant with his child ?
what ?
i wanted to tell you in person ,
but julian made sure there was nothing to tell .
julian makes me better .
he made her vindictive and cruel .
lily gave kai the idea to put elena
in that sleeping beauty coma .
i could have been a father .
i want him dead , damon .
i &apos;m in .
you &apos;re asking me to choose
between you and julian .
he &apos;s the love of my life .
please understand .
julian is looking for oscar &apos;s car .
i intend to find it first .
she was supposed to be ric &apos;s wife ,
who died with two kids inside of her
on their wedding day .
what is that ?
it &apos;s my wedding video .
i recognize this chant .
they were trying to save the next generation
of gemini twins .
i think alaric &apos;s babies are still alive .
they &apos;re inside of you .
23 minutes .
just enough time for me to get in ,
take out little miss stabby @-@ pants ,
and grab caroline .
that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s your plan ,
just take her out ?
it &apos;s simple , it &apos;s classic . come on .
yeah . listen . i saw the &quot; x &quot; carved
in stefan &apos;s chest .
pretty sure she &apos;s not playing tic @-@ tac @-@ toe .
look . this is a trap .
oh , i know it &apos;s a trap ,
and i &apos;m gonna spring it so stefan can &apos;t .
yeah . well , look . i didn &apos;t get a babysitter
on 30 seconds &apos; notice just to sit in the car .
you &apos;re not gonna just sit in the car !
turn , turn , turn , turn .
there &apos;s no way stefan didn &apos;t see caroline &apos;s broadcast .
he &apos;ll be here in a minute . when he gets here ,
pump him full of vervain so he can &apos;t hero his way in there .
if caroline &apos;s in danger , i &apos;m coming with you .
she doesn &apos;t want caroline . she wants him !
if he goes in there , he &apos;s dead .
stefan ? stefan , please .
guess you &apos;re gonna have to settle for the other one , blondie .
stefan , i--
we apologize for the interruption
to your current program .
my name is caroline .
well , that &apos;s not good .
please listen carefully .
i have an urgent message
for stefan valvatore .
well , simple enough .
two lines you &apos;re pregnant , one line you &apos;re not .
and how many lines if you &apos;ve been mystically knocked up
by a coven of dead witches ?
guess we &apos;ll find out in 3 minutes .
this is crazy .
i mean , you &apos;re an occult studies professor .
have you ever come across anything
about a pregnant vampire ?
no , but until a few weeks ago ,
i &apos;d never heard of a stone that was full
of tormented vampire souls either .
but how would it even be possible ?
i &apos;m technically dead .
well , your body basically functions normally .
your heart beats , you breathe .
i mean , is it that far outside the realm of possibility
that your body could support a baby or two ?
why would the coven want me to ?
i don &apos;t think they had a choice .
the gemini were all dying .
they couldn &apos;t let the future of their coven perish along with them ,
so they had to put the babies someplace safe ,
inside a body that--
that wouldn &apos;t die .
is that cornbread i smell ?
we &apos;re hosting thanksgiving .
thanksgiving &apos;s tomorrow .
well , pre @-@ thanksgiving . whatever .
whatever happened to taking out julian ?
remember him ? killed what would have been your firstborn ?
you know , i cleared out my entire schedule
so we could make that guy count worms--
unless you &apos;re too busy baking .
julian knows that i want him dead ,
so our next move needs to be smart .
we &apos;re probably only gonna have one more shot at this .
not quite following the whole martha stewart strategy , to be honest .
i am planning on recruiting an ally .
i brought cranberries .
negative .
i don &apos;t understand .
i mean , valerie was so certain .
well , i guess she was wrong
or playing some twisted game .
either way , i trust that a lot more than i trust her .
and i &apos;m really sorry .
i know how much you wanted this .
hey , matt . now &apos;s not really a good time .
bonnie and i found two dozen people
compelled to hang out at the high school last night .
i &apos;ve been trying to call her , but she won &apos;t pick up .
i &apos;m starting to get a little worried .
i think she &apos;s with enzo .
what ?
well , now i &apos;m a lot worried .
what the hell is she doing with him ?
i don &apos;t know . were you able to clear them out ?
we had to tranquilize them just to get them out of there ,
but they were all back this morning
like they never left .
why would someone compel people to gather
at the high school in an abandoned town ?
matt ?
matt ?
hey , care . how fast can you get to the grill ?
i invited you over here
because we can &apos;t keep doing this .
i mean , i--i want us all to start over .
well , uh , if the pilgrims and indians could do it ,
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s hope for us .
we call them native americans now ,
but we didn &apos;t bring you here to correct
your outdated racial slurs ,
did we , stefan ?
i want to convince you
of all the reasons that you need to help us
get rid of julian .
i &apos;m sorry . is this some kind of setup ?
just hear me out for a second .
1863 ...
i got valerie pregnant .
she kept it a secret from me , from you , from everyone ,
and julian found out about it somehow ,
and he felt threatened by it .
he beat her until the baby was no longer alive .
her child , your grandchild ,
was murdered by julian .
she swore me to secrecy ,
but the truth is too important .
you need to know what kind of man he is .
what i think stefan &apos;s trying to say is
you have really crappy taste .
my son , valerie lied to me for over a century about you .
then she tried to kill a member of my family in cold blood
and tried to incinerate the love of my life .
do yourself a favor .
don &apos;t lose any more sleep over the words
that come out of that poor girl &apos;s mouth .
wow . i guess the joke &apos;s on me then , right ?
i mean , i was the idiot who believed her .
i did , too , about many things ,
but i will not make that same mistake again .
here &apos;s to moving on then , right ?
to moving on .
concentrated vervain .
i ever mention i like your style ?
i had a feeling we were gonna have to do this the hard way .
best ... thanksgiving ... ever .
why would a centuries @-@ old vampire with a bunch of witch groupies
be so desperate to find anything collecting dust
in the midlothian county impound ?
seems a little beneath him .
well , if julian wants it , then so do i.
we talking about oscar &apos;s car or lily ?
you &apos;re not doing this to stop a psychopath .
you just want the girl .
congratulations .
you &apos;ve just unlocked every man &apos;s true motivation in life .
let me give you some advice .
stop treating lily like some prize to be won .
spoken like somebody &apos;s who &apos;s never been fought over .
it &apos;s not the turn @-@ on you think it is .
try flowers , a quiet dinner , listening .
found it .
i &apos;m assuming julian doesn &apos;t want it for its bluebook value .
charming .
i &apos;ll wager this is what julian &apos;s looking for .
wonder what makes it so special .
i think i &apos;ve seen that before
when i was doing research on the stone .
let me see what i can dig up .
no . i don &apos;t need research to tell me
which one &apos;s the pointy end .
what do we need to know ?
if he wants to kill someone with it
or he &apos;s worried about being killed by it .
well , there &apos;s one way to find out--
ram it through his chest , see what happens .
i know what &apos;s not gonna happen .
lily falling hopelessly in love with the person
who murdered her sweetheart .
not if i make it look like self @-@ defense .
good idea . go pick a fight
with an extremely powerful , unhinged ancient vampire .
should work out great .
is that a hint of concern for me i detect in your voice ?
now that i think about it ,
go ahead and kill each other .
win @-@ win for me .
what are you doing ?
julian &apos;s practically brainwashed you like giuseppe did way back when ?
what does gius-- giuseppe have to do with this ?
well , you didn &apos;t think dad was a monster at first ,
but somewhere along the way ,
this little warning light started blinking
&quot; psycho ! psycho ! &quot;
you just need that little light to blink again .
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s a pattern , lily .
you can &apos;t see it with julian
just like you couldn &apos;t see it with giuseppe .
do you remember that fun @-@ filled thanksgiving we had back in 1851 ?
1851 .
jog my memory , brother .
was that the year that father took me out
to the farm and made me behead my pet turkey ?
yeah . that would be the year .
ooh . that was a doozy .
if i could take just a moment
to say how thankful i am to the good lord
for giving me a beautiful wife , two fine boys ,
a table filled with fine food ,
and a stomach big enough to fit it all in .
son , eat your dinner , please .
i cannot .
what &apos;s the matter , sweetheart ?
it was not an invitation , damon .
eat .
why is he not eating ?
because this is sami .
that animal was put on this earth to be sustenance ,
not your friend .
now you will clean your plate ,
or you will spend the night in the root cellar ,
wishing you had .
mother ...
please do not make me eat her .
you heard your father , damon .
rest in peace , sami .
i kept you from wasting a perfectly good meal .
i still don &apos;t see what any of this has to do
with my current relationship .
of course you don &apos;t see it , lily .
that &apos;s the whole point !
you &apos;re too blind to see it .
you &apos;re drawn to men who manipulate you
into seeing what they want ,
men who abuse you .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
the vervain ropes searing into my flesh
are distracting me from concentrating
on your lecture about tolerating abuse .
this is pointless , pointless with pumpkin pie , but pointless .
no . we are here to open up her eyes .
you &apos;re gonna sit here ,
and you &apos;re gonna listen to every single word i say ,
and by the end of the day ,
you &apos;re gonna help us kill your boyfriend .
i found more at the courthouse
and another dozen at the supermarket .
what &apos;s with all the ivs ?
saline to keep them hydrated ,
which you &apos;d only need if you were gonna keep them here for a while .
they &apos;re using them as human blood banks .
i guess we know what the heretics are having for thanksgiving dinner .
problem is i can &apos;t find a single bite mark on any of them ,
which is somehow creepier .
they &apos;re not being fed on .
they &apos;re being fed .
i found these in the trashcan .
this is salmon , steak .
iron @-@ rich foods probably to boost their red blood cell count .
it &apos;s like someone &apos;s fattening the cattle for the slaughter .
whoa , care . hey .
are you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
no . you &apos;re not fine . you just puked .
i ...
i think i had an expired blood bag
last night or something .
you know , and then the talk of the food
and the iron and the slaughtered cattle--
so you &apos;re a vampire with food poisoning ?
yes , matt ,
i am a vampire with food poisoning ,
standing in a room of much bigger problems ,
so stop looking at me like you &apos;ve never seen a vampire vomit before
and start thinking of a way to break their compulsion .
short of turning them into vampires ,
i can &apos;t think of a way to break their compulsion .
well , maybe we don &apos;t have to break it .
maybe someone can siphon it away .
ah , the barkeep .
did you forget your tip jar , huh ?
you know who i am .
oh . yes .
the steerage waif lily took pity upon .
she told me all about you .
that &apos;s funny . she hardly mentioned you .
so what brings you here ?
i left something behind that means a great deal to me .
my guitar .
haven &apos;t seen one lying around .
perhaps lily threw it out with the rest of the rubbish .
yeah , i doubt that .
she loves it when i play for her .
sometimes begs me to .
there is no point trying to deny her .
i hope you &apos;re not suggesting anything untoward .
oh , and if i were ?
well , we &apos;d have to settle it like gentlemen .
but ...
i assured lily that there would be
no more bloodshed in the house .
did you make any promises about outside ?
you want me to siphon the compulsion
out of all these people ?
do you have any idea how long that will take ?
uh , probably the amount of time
that it will take to siphon one person
times the amount of people in this room .
i am all for scuttling julian &apos;s plans ,
but siphoning these people won &apos;t make a difference .
he &apos;ll just replace them .
you &apos;d be trading one life for another .
speaking of , i can &apos;t imagine this is
the safest town for someone with your status
to be roaming around in .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
nothing .
i wouldn &apos;t call a pregnant vampire nothing .
what ?
i am not pregnant .
i am not pregnant !
ok . valerie over here convinced poor alaric
that the gemini coven dumped his twin babies into my--
you know what ?
never mind because it &apos;s not true .
it is not true .
a test confirmed it .
yeah , and thanks to you , alaric is probably
still at home waiting for that second blue line to show up ,
so you know what ?
maybe now would be an appropriate time
to call him and explain how you could get something
so important so incredibly wrong .
do i need to remind you that you summoned me here for my help ?
if you don &apos;t think my talents are up to snuff ,
then i will gladly find other things to do with my time .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
maybe it was just a momentary lapse of ... magical juju .
look . can you just please help us
and take away these people &apos;s compulsion ?
do you know what true bravery is ?
most people don &apos;t .
it isn &apos;t going against incredible odds
and thinking you &apos;re going to win .
no . that &apos;s merely confidence .
bravery is knowing you &apos;re going to lose
but doing it anyway .
that &apos;s your strategy--
bore me into submission ?
well , if you won &apos;t let me give you an honorable way out ,
i--i have no choice but give you an honorable death .
well , let &apos;s get on with it .
choose your weapon .
are these entirely necessary ?
they &apos;re quite painful .
huh . does that burn ?
you know it does .
let me see if i can fix that .
nope . guess not .
that &apos;s enough , damon .
what ? she thinks this is painful ?
try being 12 and helpless .
i have finished .
may i be excused ?
in a moment .
lily , a bourbon , please .
i took this out for a special occasion today ,
but in the process , i discovered quite a bit of money
missing from my bureau .
you would not know anything about that ?
no .
stefan , have you been rummaging around your father &apos;s bureau ?
well , it did not just grow legs and walk off now , did it ?
which one of you did it ?
confess here and now like a man .
who took the money ?
it was not us .
to think of all the work your mother
has put into grooming you to be proper young men of society .
do you really want to put her through the heartache
of thinking she is a complete and utter failure ?
no .
then what would a man do ?
he would tell the truth .
and the truth is ?
i took it .
i didn &apos;t raise you to be a thief ,
but i also didn &apos;t raise you to be a liar ,
and you have told the truth here today .
have you learned your lesson ?
this is to make certain you remember it .
i didn &apos;t take giuseppe &apos;s money .
i only confessed because i was afraid
of what he &apos;d do to stefan .
it &apos;s your pattern , lily .
julian &apos;s a monster ,
giuseppe was a monster .
you don &apos;t think i knew that ?
i was married to the man for 20 years .
what kind of a fool do you take me for ?
do you think i believed you when i caught you digging
for ice in the icebox and you told me
you scratched your arm playing ?
i &apos;m not blind , damon .
i knew exactly what he did to you that night .
i had gone to fetch his bourbon like he asked .
i was on the stairs when i heard your scream .
you ran by me clutching your arm ,
and you didn &apos;t see me through your tears .
and you did nothing ?
you did nothing ? !
that is not true !
everything that i did--
lily !
someone--someone &apos;s trying to kill julian .
what are you talking about ?
to protect him from you ,
we--we did a spell .
we bound julian &apos;s life
to mine .
we &apos;re linked .
if he dies ,
so do i.
i see you two have met before .
where did you get that ?
you took a wrong turn and ended up in mystic falls .
leave and forget everything that you saw here .
what ?
you sure you don &apos;t want to talk
about this whole valerie baby @-@ spell thing ?
there is nothing to talk about .
care , i &apos;ve never seen you puke before .
that is because i am polite , not pregnant .
i can &apos;t have alaric &apos;s babies inside of me .
not only is it impossible ,
but it literally defies the physics of the universe .
beau .
i don &apos;t know what atrocities julian has planned ,
but you &apos;re better than this .
i know you . i &apos;m your friend .
julian is evil . he doesn &apos;t care about the family .
he only cares about himself .
invisique .
here .
thank you .
i was the one who took the money .
on thanksgiving . it was me .
i don &apos;t understand .
your father never let me have anything .
i lived under his complete control .
i--i had no means of my own ,
no access to funds .
you stood in the next room
as your son was being tortured ,
you didn &apos;t confess , and then you stayed
with the man for another 5 years ?
i was trying to save us .
we were gonna run away .
i was gonna protect you boys .
we were--we were never gonna see him again ,
but your father , even drunk and miserable ,
he was always one step ahead .
looking for these ?
i don &apos;t know what those are .
train tickets , 3 of them .
planning a trip , are we ?
oh , giuseppe , you ruined all my fun .
i thought it could be a surprise .
i--i thought you could take the boys to new york
for a weekend and see that new steamship
we read about in the paper .
you took that money ,
and i punished damon for your duplicity ,
and you tried to steal my children from me .
should you ever attempt that again ,
i will take the boys far away from here .
you will be alone , and you will never see them again .
do you understand me ?
that &apos;s why i had to stay .
giuseppe was a monster .
he wasn &apos;t manipulating me , i wasn &apos;t blind to it .
i knew it in my bones .
the only thing i cared about more than leaving him
was protecting your brother and you .
everything ...
that i did back then ...
i was doing for you .
a little tip from a professional .
next time you want to kill
a bazillion @-@ year @-@ old psycho ,
don &apos;t pick a sword from the junior section .
on the contrary , i reckon that sword
was forged for that very purpose .
incoming .
you &apos;re here .
yeah , yeah . i &apos;m here .
and you &apos;re drunk .
is everything ok ?
oh , it &apos;s just peachy .
ok . i just came to get a book that i left here .
this one .
uh , actually , i &apos;m just gonna do my research here
if that &apos;s ok with you .
my office is your office .
great .
do you want to talk about it ?
nope .
ok . didn &apos;t think so .
so , uh , enzo found some sword in oscar &apos;s car
and is under the impression it will kill julian .
found it .
this is it except it &apos;s ...
does that look like the phoenix stone to you ?
yeah , yeah , that looks like the phoenix stone to me .
ok .
&quot; the stone gives the sword its power
&quot; against immortal foes .
without it , the blade is merely a blade . &quot;
oh , no .
nice aim .
bastard links his life to my mom &apos;s
and then engages in a duel ?
what is this , &quot; hamlet &quot; community theater ? heh .
wait . back up .
what are you talking about , linked himself to your mom ?
he &apos;s using lily as a human shield .
guess he &apos;d forgotten about the part
that half the people actually left in this town
hate her guts .
damon , tell me you did not just kill lily .
shouldn &apos;t you be ... deader ?
are you hurt ?
i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re not really the one that i &apos;m worried about .
isn &apos;t it possible that &quot; kill the psycho &quot;
and &quot; save the babies &quot; just sound similar in witch latin ,
not to mention that you &apos;ve been out of their loop
for , like , 100 years .
1,000 years could pass , i would never forget that spell .
there &apos;s not a day goes by i don &apos;t think about those words .
why do you know so much about this ?
like you care .
i mean , it &apos;s not like you believe anything i say .
i &apos;m willing to believe you .
ok ?
i need you to be 100 % honest with me , please .
how do you know so much about this spell ?
because i &apos;ve used it .
i was pregnant before i turned .
julian knew that if lily found out
it would ruin his plans with her .
she would want to return to mystic falls instead ,
so he promptly ended it ,
but i did everything in my power to save the life inside me .
i didn &apos;t have an entire coven to work with .
it was just me .
hard as a i tried ,
i wasn &apos;t strong enough .
but why would you having a baby
make lily want to come home to mystic falls ?
that &apos;s the big secret that you have with stefan .
the baby was his ?
our story may have ended in tragedy ,
but you have a chance to see that your friend alaric &apos;s doesn &apos;t .
valerie , the test was negative .
test again .
don &apos;t !
oh , thank god you &apos;re all right .
you must have been given such a scare .
what &apos;s going on here ?
damon drove a sword into my chest ,
knowing it would be the same as driving it into yours .
of course ...
he was under the impression it would kill me .
what is he talking about ?
what difference does it make ?
didn &apos;t work anyway .
take me home , please .
what ?
well , look who &apos;s finally calling me back .
sorry . i got waylaid at an impound lot with enzo ,
which is somehow not even the worst part of my day .
i needed your help , bon . instead you were ditching my calls
to hang out with the guy who recently kidnapped your roommate .
uh , we weren &apos;t hanging out .
i was helping him find some sword to kill julian .
where are you ? i &apos;ll meet you .
don &apos;t bother . tyler and jeremy actually took my call .
they think they found a way to help ,
and i &apos;m looking into it .
guess we could both use a drink .
i heard today didn &apos;t go so well .
with the sword or with lily ?
because the answer &apos;s the same .
so that &apos;s it ? you giving up ?
when 9 russians tell you you &apos;re drunk ,
you lie down .
lily made her intentions clear .
good .
you &apos;re better off without her .
come on ! you can &apos;t honestly say you &apos;re surprised , can you ?
you wanted julian dead ,
i wanted to punish mom ,
and i had a way to kill two birds with one stone !
i am never gonna change ,
lily is never gonna change ,
and you are never gonna change !
you &apos;re never gonna stop straining to find
one tiny speck of redemption in lily ,
and she &apos;s never gonna stop disappointing you .
you &apos;re wrong ! you don &apos;t know the whole story !
i don &apos;t want to know the whole story , stefan !
i don &apos;t want to know any more excuses or lies
or anything that tells me anything other
than the way i know it went down .
our mother faked her death , left her sons behind ,
started a new family , and went out of her way
to forget us forever !
that is the only story that matters , stefan .
she tossed us aside without any concern what would happen to us .
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
she deserves what she gets .
she deserves what she gets .
i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i could use a warm bath .
what were you doing in the woods with lorenzo ?
well , you know me .
never one to resist a sword fight .
except my life was bound to yours .
i &apos;m also never one to lose .
julian , this-- this isn &apos;t just red wine
spilled down my shirt .
darling , you were never in any danger .
oh . funny how choking on your own blood
makes you feel like it .
we were boys being boys , fighting for your honor .
if anything , it was silly .
well , until one of your rude , misbehaved sons
showed up and tried to kill us both .
did you know valerie was once pregnant with stefan &apos;s child ?
valerie ? no . i did not .
according to my sons , you did know ,
and when you found out , you beat her
until she lost the child .
lily ...
you know me .
you know how deeply that i care
about the family that we have built ,
and i would do anything to keep us together .
i would never have done something so revolting .
listen to me rambling on .
you must have been so upset today ,
and here i am acting like it was nothing .
it would destroy me if i ever hurt you .
will you forgive me ?
of course .
i hate to see you in such pain .
i was drunk and not myself ,
but the thought of losing you and my sons ,
it brought out a rage in me .
i can &apos;t be faulted for trying to keep my family together .
will you forgive me ?
of course .
of course .
come here .
look at me .
i love you , darling .
i will never hurt you .
how far along are you ?
uh , i &apos;m not really sure how to answer that .
ok . let &apos;s see what we can see .
and you &apos;re certain you &apos;re pregnant ?
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
well , i &apos;m not seeing one baby , let alone two .
and you &apos;re absolutely sure ?
twins would be hard to miss .
i &apos;m not hearing any heartbeats either .
i &apos;m sorry if you were informed otherwise .
i &apos;ll give you some time alone .
i &apos;m so sorry .
no .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
that i &apos;ve been so desperate
to believe this was actually possible .
i , uh ...
i , um--i &apos;m really sorry that i put you through all this .
honestly ...
for a second there , i believed it , too .
i , um , saw the doctor leave .
she just told us that you were wrong .
are you sure about that ?
what are you doing ?
oh , my god .
i &apos;m not sure you &apos;re qualified to use that .
just let her . you know , it never made any sense to me .
the spell pointed directly to you ,
but the tests came up negative ,
and then it hit me .
i cloaked you from beau to protect you .
alaric &apos;s babies are the future of the coven .
they would have protected them in any way they could .
wait , wait . how is this all possible ?
they were cloaked .
did you come back to get your dish ?
may i come in ?
what &apos;s going on ?
you were right .
pardon me ? i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t--i didn &apos;t quite hear what you said .
you were right about julian .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t see it sooner .
i &apos;ve traded one monster for another ,
but i am not going to let him hurt us anymore .
i have a plan , and this time ,
we won &apos;t get caught .
