two years ago , i tried to tell you i loved you .
you loved me ?
i have feelings for you . i don &apos;t wanna ruin our friendship .
i think we should just throw down and see what happens .
i mean , we just fell asleep .
after an entire bottle of wine ...
and one kiss .
a kiss is not nothing .
people kiss because they have feelings for each other .
blair , you and i are magnetic .
our pull is as undeniable as ever .
i &apos;ll be waiting at the top of the empire state building .
at 7 : 01 , i &apos;m closing my heart to you forever .
hi , i &apos;m meeting a young man here ,
probably in a bowtie , possibly carrying peonies .
i did the most romantic thing i could think of ,
and it didn &apos;t work .
i &apos;m sorry .
chuck ? what are you doing ?
is there someone in there ?
no , nobody .
dorota went into labor .
sorry i was so late .
i can &apos;t deny that our path has been complicated ,
but in the end , love makes everything simple .
i wanted it to be special .
what happened ?
you need to ask her .
i am so sorry for the pain i &apos;ve caused you .
blair , will you be--uhh !
humphrey !
you--tell her .
you didn &apos;t .
blair .
you did .
you , go and never come back .
i think i need to be alone for a while .
if you &apos;re out , you &apos;re out .
nate , i love you .
i &apos;m someone who &apos;s not gonna stop looking for love ,
which is why i &apos;m going to paris , and why you &apos;re coming with me .
i really think i need this .
me , too .
it &apos;s gonna be okay , b.
georgina , what are you--what are you doing back in town ?
congratulations , daddy .
he looks just like you .
i &apos;m not gonna spend the entire summer
waiting for her to figure things out .
when he took off for prague ,
chuck left me his little black book .
there &apos;s no need to get rough .
hey ! not that .
just let me keep the box !
nothing beats a summer abroad ,
but when traveling far from home , it &apos;s always nice
to bring along an old friend from the neighborhood .
cobblestones and cafe de flore .
serena &apos;s locked down the left bank
and become a muse to us all .
meanwhile , blair rules the right bank ,
storming the shops and consuming the classics
and sampling sugary snacks
like a modern marie antoinette .
but we hear serena &apos;s stories sizzle
while blair &apos;s are more fizzle .
she shopped at saint laurent
and dined at drouant ,
but the only beau b. had this summer
is on her headband .
your cute waiter gave me his number .
blair , what are you doing ?
we said we wouldn &apos;t check &quot; gossip girl &quot; all summer .
summer &apos;s almost over .
so what does it say about chuck ?
i couldn &apos;t be less interested .
no new posts .
he &apos;s been m.i.a. since he left town in spring .
and what does it say about us ?
&quot; ooh la la ! paris is burning ,
and serena and blair lit the match . &quot;
of course , your flame is hotter than mine .
everyone knows that the only guy
who &apos;s been in my pants all summer
is the tailor at pierre balmain .
and whose fault is that ?
hey , just as many guys have flirted with you .
i just happen to have a thing for french waiters .
and bartenders and museum docents ,
anyone on a vespa or bicycle ,
or wearing zadig &amp; voltaire .
b. , what &apos;s wrong ? i thought you were having fun .
i am . the best . but ...
all summer , i &apos;ve been sitting in front of my favorite manet
and reading colette in the park ,
hoping that i &apos;ll lock eyes with somebody who &apos;s doing
the same thing as me and feeling the same things as i am .
that &apos;s really romantic .
but , alas , not effective .
for all my efforts , i &apos;m heading back home
with a chuck @-@ sized cloud over my head .
and i don &apos;t ... even need to find a great love .
i just wanna go on one nice date .
well , then this calls for some more sancerre .
come on . i know a great wine bar down the street ,
and it happens to have a very cute bartender .
jenny looked so good .
you could even tell what color her eyes are .
well , sending her to hudson was a good decision .
you know what wasn &apos;t ?
visiting my mother . we had to .
yeah . couldn &apos;t we have just said the arno flooded
and stayed with eric and elliot
in italy a little longer ?
message one .
lillian , it &apos;s eleanor .
just a reminder
that you offered your lovely abode
for the fashion &apos;s night out planning luncheon tomorrow .
cyrus , you &apos;re going to cut off ana &apos;s circulation .
seriously , dear .
aren &apos;t you glad that &apos;s not us ?
imagine starting all over again
with diapers and bottles and spit up .
next message .
lily , it &apos;s bruce caplan .
call me when you get in . it &apos;s important .
the bass business manager . i wonder what he wants .
if it &apos;s about chuck , i &apos;d rather not know .
end of messages .
no message from dan ?
last time we went this long without talking
was when he had his tonsils out .
and i am sick of texting .
since he hasn &apos;t called us ,
it &apos;s time to call in the big guns .
please , wake me up with a few--few stories
from chuck &apos;s little black book .
i , uh , i think the last time we spoke ,
you--you &apos;d made it through all the t &apos;s .
yeah , well , let &apos;s just say &quot; v &quot; is for &quot; vivid &quot;
and leave it at that .
i mean , it &apos;s pretty awesome .
i &apos;m having tons of sex ,
i never have to eat dinner alone ,
and best of all , i don &apos;t have to talk about anything .
so the key to a good relationship
is no relationship at all ? mm .
it does get pretty exhausting , though .
hey , don &apos;t--don &apos;t get me started on exhausted .
hey , what you &apos;re really tired of is
keeping everything a big secret .
no , no , no. my--my--my dad and lily are home today so i &apos;m--
i &apos;m--i &apos;ll tell them , i promise .
tell them what ?
what decision ? it &apos;s not mine to make .
nate broke up with me ,
and dan was trying to patch things up with vanessa .
well , i &apos;m not asking you to make predictions about them .
it &apos;s about you , what &apos;s in your heart .
at night when you &apos;re falling asleep ,
what are you wishing for ?
when you asked me on this trip ,
you promised me retail therapy .
i fall asleep
thinking about guys named louboutin and laurent .
home doesn &apos;t exist until we &apos;re there .
speaking of home ...
mademoiselle , pour vous .
oh . merci , delfine .
judging from its weight and size ,
i &apos;d say it &apos;s your course catalogue from brown .
i &apos;ll let you know when i open it .
you know , as much as i &apos;m gonna miss you when you &apos;re in providence ,
having separate lives ensures no competition ,
which means no high school pettiness .
promise we won &apos;t go back to our old ways .
like you said , that was high school .
so you have no idea where he is ?
well , charles didn &apos;t exactly leave town on good terms ,
and even when he does ,
he finds it best not to tell us where he &apos;s going ,
for our own sakes .
yeah , well , i need your help in finding him this time , and fast .
he hasn &apos;t paid the mortgage on the empire since may .
that &apos;s when he left . yeah .
well , the bank says one more missed payment ,
he &apos;ll be in default .
so these are the last records of his movements .
it &apos;s plane tickets , credit card charges , a.t.m. withdrawals .
why don &apos;t you look &apos; em over and maybe make a few calls ?
of course . thank you , bruce .
thank you . we &apos;ll find him .
okay .
hey , mom .
hi , sweetheart . i wanna hear all about your day--
the food , the shopping ,
and the boys on vespas .
well , that pretty much sums it up .
but first , um ,
i wanted to know
if you or blair have heard from charles .
no , and i don &apos;t expect to .
it &apos;s actually decent of him , leaving her alone .
yeah , poor blair . is she still hurting ?
yeah , but she &apos;s putting up a good front .
and i wouldn &apos;t worry about chuck .
any normal summer ,
he &apos;s drunk on some island where polygamy &apos;s legal .
given everything that happened , it makes sense he &apos;s gone rogue .
why you so interested ?
oh , no , uh , if you don &apos;t know anything , i can find out myself .
you just keep having a good time . how are you ?
i &apos;m not sure .
i got into columbia .
serena , that &apos;s wonderful .
yeah .
yeah , but i &apos;m not sure blair will think so .
your dad called me . he said he couldn &apos;t reach you .
i told him he should try serena
because i assumed you &apos;d be with her ,
because what other reason could there possibly be
that you haven &apos;t called or e @-@ mailed me all summer ,
or making me have this conversation in the doorway .
no , vanessa , i &apos;m so sorry about that , but there is a reason .
is it ...
because you &apos;ve become a hoarder ? you know what ?
a @-@ after what you did , i shouldn &apos;t even care .
but ... are you okay ?
i &apos;m ...
i guess you &apos;re more than okay .
is that the reason you &apos;ve been avoiding everyone ?
because you &apos;re seeing someone new ?
no , i &apos;m not . i &apos;m--i &apos;m not .
dan , is there someone here ?
you know what ? this was a mistake . i &apos;m gonna go .
that &apos;s probably a good idea . thanks .
you &apos;re dating georgina ?
no . no , we &apos;re not dating .
that &apos;s true . we barely ever leave the house .
no , but it &apos;s not--it &apos;s not for the reason you think .
then what other possible reason could there be
in the god @-@ i @-@ don &apos;t @-@ believe @-@ in &apos;s universe for georgina sparks
to be leaving lingerie around your house ?
meet milo .
he &apos;s our son .
no .
no . shut up !
no , you--you really-- you have to shut up ...
right now .
shut up !
oh , my god .
okay , you didn &apos;t . you did ?
are you serious ?
shut up !
god ! oh , my-- tiff , do you mind ?
oh . sorry .
okay , you didn &apos;t .
you did not .
you did ? !
wouldn &apos;t wanna interrupt your girlfriend &apos;s private conversation .
it seemed pretty important .
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
i was being polite .
no , she &apos;s not that , either .
she &apos;s just a ... friend of a friend .
what kind of a friend is that ?
the kind that leaves me his little black book
for the summer .
and i doubt your friend would bring his friend
to a place like norma &apos;s .
well , it &apos;s the least i can do ,
to take her to a nice restaurant .
i mean , that perkins hostess
slept with tiger woods for over a year ,
and all he got her was a chicken wrap .
oh . that &apos;s respectable .
thank you .
so why isn &apos;t it your companion ?
well , i tried respectable .
you were hurt .
no .
well , i guess there &apos;s a ...
first time for everything .
easy come , easy go .
i can &apos;t tell if your approach is enlightened or chauvinistic .
take her seat and find out .
that &apos;s a good line .
you almost pulled it off .
but ... i have an appointment i can &apos;t be late for .
well , nate archibald .
could i at least get your number ?
what , it &apos;s not in your friend &apos;s little black book ?
an american who loves manet ?
it &apos;s too good to be true .
how did you know i was american ?
and don &apos;t tell me
it &apos;s because my accent isn &apos;t as good as i think .
your accent is divine .
but your watch is set to eastern standard time .
new york ?
born and bred .
i &apos;ve never been ,
but i &apos;d love to hear all about it .
over dinner tonight ?
it would be my pleasure .
great .
give me your information , and i @-@ i &apos;ll pick you up at 9 : 00 .
louis ?
i &apos;ll see you tonight .
wait , wait . a car ?
embassy ? grimaldi ? don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re--
i &apos;m louis . just louis .
hey , where are you ?
i wanted to talk to you this morning , but you &apos;d already left .
i think i just met a real live prince .
a grimaldi--as in the royal family of monaco .
as in grace &quot; american princess &quot; kelly .
stop whatever you &apos;re doing . we need to shop .
only for you , b.
spotted--b . and s. ,
chic and cheerful
up on boulevard haussmann .
they dallied at department stores
and stayed a while at tally weijl .
down on rue saint @-@ honor ?
they courted couture at palais royal
and found the perfect outfits
to bash the competition .
then they headed to the golden triangle ,
where montaigne meets george cinq ,
and luxury goods are the opiate of choice .
but the grimaldis aren &apos;t a very large family .
he &apos;s probably a first cousin at least ,
but just to be sure ...
b. , what are you doing ?
cinderella did not google prince charming .
a mystery man shows up at your painting ,
just like you wanted .
you cannot make this about some social agenda .
you &apos;re right , and so what
if my fairy godmother is my credit card ?
this is fate .
wait , before i lose you to another shoe coma ,
there &apos;s something i wanna talk to you about .
that package i got yesterday ...
s. , i want to hear all about
how brown offers a major in raw foods , but ...
it &apos;s louis ! we &apos;re going to baccarat !
i have just the thing to wear .
and you have to pick up a little something , too .
his friend jean michel showed up unexpectedly in town ,
and our date is now a double .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
this is your princess moment .
please ? if you don &apos;t come , he &apos;s gonna cancel .
and those brown boots would look amazing on you .
brown ! what did you want to tell me about college ?
it can wait . let &apos;s go buy boots .
look , i @-@ i &apos;m--i &apos;m working on it .
i just need a little more time .
you have one day .
not again , milo .
can &apos;t you ever sleep for more than five minutes ?
sorry , i think i have the wrong number .
oh . mr. humphrey .
um , this is georgina sparks .
it &apos;s so great to hear from you .
it is ?
georgina , i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
w @-@ why are you answering my phone ?
where &apos;s dan ?
listen , i &apos;m sorry that we couldn &apos;t talk more yesterday .
milo &apos;s been real colicky .
the fact that you even know that word is--
oh , oh , oh , oh , you &apos;d be shocked at what i know
about breast @-@ feeding and baby poop and episiotomies .
wow , do not mention her geor @-@ gina .
it &apos;s a lot to take in .
believe me .
but please--please don &apos;t tell my dad or--or lily , all right ?
i gotta be the one to tell them myself .
why haven &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t know. maybe &apos; cause i &apos;m totally freaking out ?
do you know how difficult it is to keep a baby alive ?
you can &apos;t drop it . you can &apos;t leave it alone .
it has to eat , like , every three hours .
if i don &apos;t know what hit me here ,
how am i supposed to tell my dad ?
i have to ask , as will rufus--
are you sure milo &apos;s yours ?
of course he is .
i mean , i &apos;m pre-- yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure .
you didn &apos;t have a paternity test ?
vanessa , you weren &apos;t there when she came to me .
her parents threw her out. she was--she was scared .
it was actually my idea for her to move in .
i &apos;ve been waiting for the crazy shoe to drop ...
but it never did .
i mean , she &apos;s-- she &apos;s been great with milo .
dan , we &apos;re talking about georgina sparks .
her hair lies .
you can &apos;t trust one thing that comes out of her mouth ,
let alone anywhere else .
i know . i asked her for a paternity test ,
but you can &apos;t get one in the last trimester .
i didn &apos;t sign the birth certificate .
i told her i wouldn &apos;t until we got the test .
what are you waiting for ?
you have outdone yourself once again . truly fit for a king .
well , not a king yet , but maybe someday .
you clean up pretty good , too .
merci .
oh . he &apos;s driving himself .
that &apos;s ... progressive .
independent .
louis , bonsoir .
blair , you look amazing .
and this must be serena .
uh , nice to meet you .
nice to meet you . serena , um , may i introduce
jean michel grimaldi
of monaco ?
blair , enchant ?
i don &apos;t understand . i thought you were a grimaldi .
the chauffeur was taking you to the embassy .
oh , you misunderstood .
i am a driver for jean michel &apos;s family .
i took them to the embassy , where they &apos;re staying .
oh . i @-@ i see .
so that means your date is a prince ,
and mine ...
is charming , handsome , and loves manet .
we make our own fairy tales .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ve never sat up here before .
oh , wait .
spotted--b . riding shotgun .
great view .
let &apos;s see if our royal wannabe
has the grace to make it through the night .
eleanor , you &apos;re early .
well , just to set up , dear ,
and to accessorize you properly .
you know &quot; bass &quot; is not her middle name .
well ... i was afraid nobody would know who she was .
not a lot of humphreys in the society pages .
you don &apos;t have to stick around if you don &apos;t want .
oh , you think i &apos;d skip out
on a roomful of champagne and models ?
are you forgetting i used to be a rock star ?
oh , what is this ?
why do you have chuck &apos;s travel itinerary ,
bank statements , and credit card bills ?
because i think he might be in trouble .
after what he did ? good .
well , apparently , he went to prague in may ,
checked into his usual suite at the mandarin ,
and never checked out .
his credit card charges are very un @-@ charles @-@ like-
second @-@ class train tickets , prepaid cell phones .
what if something happened to him ?
look , for better or worse , he &apos;s a part of this family .
yours , not ours .
and after the choices he &apos;s made ,
chuck deserves whatever &apos;s coming to him .
did i hear you say chuck ?
blair will not even mention his name .
she never even told me why they broke up .
uh , you wanna tell her or should i ?
aren &apos;t you so excited that our girls
will be at columbia together this year ?
what ? !
i didn &apos;t even know that serena had applied .
here you go , danielle .
and if the c.f.d.a. needs more volunteers ,
let me know . i &apos;m around .
of course .
juliet , have you met willy wong from nyc &amp; company ?
oh . nice to meet you , juliet .
nice to meet you . oh . here you go .
thank you .
and drinks are to your left .
thank you .
thank you .
and the guards at the casino were charging on us .
$ 1,000 chips were flying everywhere .
everywhere .
then a guard grabbed me by my belt
and dragged me out to the street .
all because he was wearing blue jeans .
it was crazy .
oh ! oh , my gosh .
sure ,
but enforcing strict standards of dress is essential
for maintaining the decorum of an event .
besides , it &apos;s tradition .
men &apos;s formalwear hasn &apos;t changed
hardly in over a hundred years .
and it &apos;s not just a symbol of class .
owning a tuxedo shows the world
that a man has enough means
to marry and provide a future for his family .
blair , are you okay ?
it &apos;s my mother calling from new york .
i should take this . i &apos;m fine .
so who wants a bite of her dessert ?
what is it , mother ? i can &apos;t talk long . i &apos;m on a date .
blair , you sound irritated . are you okay ?
why does everyone keep asking me that ?
so what if serena always gets the prince
and i get the pauper ?
being jealous of her is totally constance ,
and i &apos;ve moved on .
well , that &apos;s wonderfully mature , dear .
and the best part is that nothing has to change
now that she &apos;s going to be at columbia .
what ? serena &apos;s going to columbia ?
let me know if there &apos;s anything else i can do for you ,
karlie .
thanks . is eleanor here ?
uh ... oh , right there .
thanks .
nate ?
juliet .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m a volunteer . i worked the event last year .
what are you doing here ?
nathaniel , thank you for getting here so fast .
i was hoping you could look at charles &apos; papers
and see if there was anything that you might find that i haven &apos;t .
but steer clear of rufus , okay ?
okay .
blair , come meet lou doillon .
bonjour .
bonjour . hey , maybe you could ask lou doillon
to be your new best friend , because i &apos;m done .
have fun on my date .
excuse me .
can i get your name ?
no .
oh , god . this is not good .
georgina . to what do we owe the pleasure ?
you have 15 seconds to top me off or you &apos;re fired .
ahem , georgina , maybe you should come with me .
that &apos;s sweet , archibald , but i don &apos;t like vanilla .
does dan know you &apos;re here ?
why would dan know ?
hello , dan .
hey , uh , i &apos;m--i &apos;m at home , and you guys aren &apos;t here .
what , you go on a walk without me ?
yes , we did , all the way across the bridge .
georgina , don &apos;t do this .
what ? w @-@ why ?
i just thought it was time everyone met .
would you like to talk to your dad ?
rufus , dan &apos;s on the phone . he &apos;d like to speak with you .
dad , i am so sorry . i @-@ i wanted to tell you .
i just--i @-@ i didn &apos;t know how .
tell me what ?
whose baby is that ?
here you go , grandpa .
oh , god .
this is milo humphrey , your grandson .
daniel ?
dan ?
spotted--georgina sparks , a stroller ,
and dan &apos;s dad with a scowl .
i think he &apos;s on his way .
looks like lonely boy has a baby boy .
meredith , i am so sorry about this .
please apologize to everyone at &quot; vogue . &quot;
um , unfortunately , something has come up .
but eleanor has said she &apos;s more than happy
to continue the party at her place .
and we &apos;ve got a little one there as well .
absolutely adorable thing . you &apos;ll love her .
what &apos;s going on ?
why does georgina sparks have a baby ?
we are still trying to figure that out . i &apos;ll keep you posted .
okay . bye .
meredith . hello , nathaniel .
i wanna take you to ...
who could &apos;ve seen this coming ?
have you met georgina ?
good point . where is she ?
she ...
please tell me
this is just another one of her ridiculous schemes .
dad ...
why don &apos;t you , um , talk in serena &apos;s room ?
sorry all the drama ruined your luncheon today .
that &apos;s okay .
well , in case you &apos;re wondering ,
my life &apos;s been pretty drama @-@ free these days .
uh , hello ?
pardon the interruption , mr. archibald ,
but there &apos;s an emergency in your suite .
what kind of an emergency ?
hey , there you are . what &apos;s wrong ?
you can have the left bank , okay ? but i want the right .
every cleavage @-@ baring blouson and cute bartender is yours .
but i want a dress from dior
and i want a date with a royal .
and i wanna go to school .
and take classes and have friends
without living in your shadow for the next three years .
you heard about columbia .
do you wanna hold him ?
look , i @-@ i wasn &apos;t expecting this introduction either .
you didn &apos;t have to spring it on us like this .
i know i have a flair for the dramatic .
but i didn &apos;t know what else to do .
dan wasn &apos;t telling you , and you had to know .
at least now everybody &apos;s talking .
oh , please . you &apos;re enjoying this .
i know you think i &apos;m crazy , that i &apos;m a schemer and a liar
and pathologically selfish , and--and that &apos;s true .
or it was ,
till milo was born .
i understand if you hate me .
please don &apos;t hate my son .
he deserves to have a good family ,
and no one has more love than you or rufus .
lily , dan hasn &apos;t done a paternity test .
it might not be his kid .
is this true , georgina ?
you &apos;re right , rufus .
dan did not do the paternity test ,
but i did .
i wanted you to love milo because you wanted to ,
not because you had to .
but ... if it &apos;s come to this , then so be it .
this--this says i &apos;m the father .
well , no offense if i don &apos;t take your word for it .
blair , i &apos;m sorry . i know you wanna do your own thing .
but columbia isn &apos;t yours .
my dad went to med school there .
he encouraged me to apply . and i wanna go to college ,
but i don &apos;t wanna leave the city .
i wanna be with my family and my friends .
i @-@ i wanna be with you .
oh , lucky me !
i love how it never has occurred to you
that someone might not wanna see you every single day .
&quot; someone , &quot; sure .
probably lots of people , but not my best friend .
i need a chance to succeed on my own .
i wanna be myself , where i belong .
last year , first with n.y.u.
and then chuck--
it was the worst year of my life .
yeah , well , my last year was pretty awful , too .
i @-@ i @-@ i fell for a married man , got in a major car accident .
i fought with my mother so much i was basically homeless .
and then there was my dad ...
fine . stay in the city .
just go to a different school , okay ?
blair , i wanna make you happy . i really do .
but college is too big of a deal .
i got in and i &apos;m gonna go .
look , we can talk about all of this tomorrow .
but right now ,
there are two very handsome frenchmen waiting to take us
to the front of the line at le baron .
louis really likes you .
yes , he does .
and so does jean michel , for that matter .
i &apos;ll go back , by myself ,
and i &apos;ll come up with some story as to why you didn &apos;t return--
that you tripped and fell in the fountain .
seriously ? no one &apos;s gonna believe that .
wanna bet ?
well , thank you , doctor .
i @-@ i appreciate you confirming these results yourself .
okay . bye .
it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
we &apos;re doing our own test .
dad , the dates line up . i @-@ i thought we were being careful ,
but it &apos;s not like i didn &apos;t sleep with her .
why didn &apos;t you come to me when she first showed up ?
do you remember how you reacted two years ago
when serena and i had that scare ?
not to mention i didn &apos;t know
that i could handle the truth myself .
everything you said then is--is still true .
i had to see this through .
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t let georgina go off ,
raise this child without me , nev--never knowing him .
i may get angry or protective ,
but i &apos;ll always be there for you .
that &apos;s how it works when you &apos;re a father .
you may not understand that now ,
but trust me , one day you will .
i @-@ i think i already do .
georgina , do you have the birth certificate with you ?
it &apos;s in my bag .
thank you .
thanks , dad .
what are you doing ?
you wanna play &quot; rock band 3 &quot; with us ?
there &apos;s a keyboard . we can make it a 5 @-@ piece .
oh , i hope it &apos;s okay . we used your credit card .
your friend who left you his book--what was his name ?
chuck bass .
and what would chuck bass do in a situation like this ?
he wouldn &apos;t be in this situation .
and you shouldn &apos;t be either .
when you &apos;re ready to talk about
what really got you into this place ...
give me a call .
you &apos;re a natural .
thanks .
have you talked to serena lately ?
well , the better question is , have you ?
i know something happened between you two before she left .
but i &apos;m guessing you haven &apos;t had much time to figure things out .
there &apos;s nothing to figure at this point .
i @-@ i can &apos;t imagine she &apos;d be interested
in being a stepmother .
yeah , i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve sealed my fate , i think .
but , but--but when you do speak to her , if you could
do me a favor and just not say anything about this ?
i wanna be the one to break this news .
yeah , of course .
is she having a good time ?
well , it &apos;s paris .
there &apos;s great shopping , great food ,
weekends with harold and roman at the chateau .
i think she &apos;s having the time of her life .
i know , jean michel . we all love serena ,
but she &apos;s just clumsy like that .
it must be all those long limbs .
serena .
what happened ?
blair happened . i &apos;ll see you in new york .
jean michel , would you care to walk me home ?
wait , no , jean michel ! don &apos;t !
that &apos;s okay . i &apos;m glad to have you all to myself .
actually ... i &apos;m tired .
if jean michel is gone , shouldn &apos;t we go , too ?
he told me i was being overcautious ,
but i see that i was not .
about what ?
i am the royal . jean michel is my driver .
when you asked me so many questions about my name ,
my car , the embassy ,
i grew concerned that you might not like me for me .
what ? no . who--who would ever--
it happens sometimes .
but when i found you gazing at my favorite painting ,
i thought that someone who loved what i loved could--
could one day love me , too .
we hear baccarat just updated its menu .
i thought it was fate , but i guess not .
no , no , no . it is fate . it &apos;s just ...
have a good evening , blair .
the gateau du jour is now humble pie .
bon appetit , blair .
hello ?
georgina ? it &apos;s vanessa .
dan and the baby are sleeping right now .
yeah , i just tried his cell .
do you have a message ?
i don &apos;t really have time to chat right now .
i just wanted to tell him that i am here
if he needs to talk .
i &apos;m his friend and always will be .
oh , that &apos;s sweet . he &apos;s gonna need a friend .
i &apos;ll let him know .
and just in case you don &apos;t ,
i said the same thing on his voicemail .
you know me too well , friend .
good @-@ bye , vanessa .
is it any consolation
that i totally imploded and ruined my date ?
it &apos;s not .
i called the airport . the car is already on the way .
i can catch the red @-@ eye .
can you hand me that copy of &quot; be &quot; ?
i wanna read it on the plane .
please don &apos;t go .
i don &apos;t care about dating a prince .
i don &apos;t care about dating anyone . i just care about you .
i really need my friend right now .
i &apos;ve been acting like i &apos;m okay , but i &apos;m not .
they say it &apos;s a broken heart , but ...
i hurt in my whole body .
i mean , what if i stay like this forever ?
what if i never get over chuck ?
you will . you &apos;ll see .
i just don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do without you .
i &apos;m scared if you come to columbia
that i &apos;ll do something to destroy us .
well , you pushed me in a fountain tonight ,
and here we are , talking about it like mature young women .
so i &apos;d say that &apos;s a good sign .
and what if columbia &apos;s a disaster ,
and we lose each other for good ?
and what if it &apos;s amazing ,
and we become closer than we &apos;ve ever been ?
come on .
live dangerously .
you in ?
yeah , i &apos;m in .
now all you have to do is tell dan and nate
that you &apos;ll be in the city next year .
what are you doing ?
spreading the word myself . and you can &apos;t change your mind
because gossip girl hates being wrong .
this just in from miss b. herself :
serena van der woodsen is heading to columbia .
s. and b. together again ?
we think we &apos;ve died and gone to heaven .
or at least the upper west side ...
nate .
hey , i know it &apos;s late .
but you know what ? you were right .
i @-@ i was hurt ...
by someone . a lot , actually .
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t think i was gonna have to see her again for a while ,
and i just found out she &apos;s coming back to new york city
and ... i &apos;m just not ready .
you know , i was trying to send a message to her
that i &apos;m having the time of my life , and it just isn &apos;t true .
i can &apos;t keep it up . i &apos;m exhausted .
i owe the hotel thousands of dollars in damages .
do you wanna meet up to grab a cup of coffee ?
sometimes it &apos;s easier to talk to a stranger .
that sounds--sounds great . yeah .
french roast , 20 minutes ?
absolutely .
it &apos;s from france .
hello ?
yes , this is she .
oh , my god , is it serena ? is she okay ?
okay , i will .

w @-@ where am i ?
you &apos;re safe .

what &apos;s your name ?
h @-@ henry .
henry prince .
you had the dream again .
i hoped it wouldn &apos;t follow us from prague .
i guess i &apos;ll have to give it more time .
you have as long as you need .
my uncle said the apartment is ours ,
and he &apos;s got you a job , too .
thank you .
welcome to paris , henry .

napoleon once said
that secrets travel fast in paris .
but gossip girl travels faster .
