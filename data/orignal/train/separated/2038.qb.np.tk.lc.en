i want you to decide if you love me
more than you hate what i did ,
and if you do ,
then i want you to come home .
and the only they &apos;ll definitely find
if they get a look at those files ,
is that you embezzled money .
listen to me , god damn it . we need to undo this deal .
we have nothing to hide .
no , no , this is a ploy .
he &apos;s trying to get me on record stating that
we have everything , and if i find nothing ,
he &apos;s gonna file malicious prosecution charges .
actually , sean , i &apos;m filing those charges right now .
harvey went to court this morning ,
and agreed to hand over every single document on the gillis takeover ,
including forstman .
shit !
then it &apos;s only a matter of time before
i &apos;m marched out of here in handcuffs .
if he did make a dirty deal with forstman ,
it wouldn &apos;t have been in those documents .
it would &apos;ve been in--
the documents
we just told the court we &apos;re happy to turn over .
what are you going to do ?
i &apos;m gonna find out what the hell louis did .
i made a huge mistake .
what &apos;s going on ?
louis , i want you to tell harvey exactly
what you just told me , or i will .
he doesn &apos;t have to .
he made a dirty deal with forstman .
harvey , i can explain .
explain what , that you put the firm in jeopardy
all because you had to be the hero ?
i didn &apos;t do it to be the hero .
i didn &apos;t even know i was gonna do it at all .
what ?
the deal was closed , and you were so happy we won .
then i went back that night , forstman said if i didn &apos;t
funnel the money overseas , the deal was off ,
so i did it .
there &apos;s more .
how do you know there &apos;s more ?
because with forstman there &apos;s always more .
he made me take a million dollars out of the deal so
i couldn &apos;t turn on him later .
jesus christ .
i had no choice !
bullshit , you had no choice !
you could &apos;ve said no at any goddamn point along the way ,
but you didn &apos;t , because all you cared about was yourself .
okay , if i care about myself so much ,
how come i &apos;m in here telling you that i &apos;m gonna confess ?
you want to confess ? be my guest !
harvey , that &apos;s enough .
louis ... the problem with that
is that we &apos;re innocent .
cahill &apos;s plan is to throw mud against the wall
and see what sticks .
you tell him about what you did ,
and all of a sudden ,
everything sticks .
okay .
but i have to do something to help .
you will , when the time comes .
right now , i need to talk to harvey .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re taking
this as well as you are .
i &apos;m not taking this well at all .
then what the hell are you being so nice to him for ?
did you hear ?
he was going to confess .
i had to calm him down .
so you &apos;re not gonna stand by him ?
stand by him ?
the second this thing is over ,
i &apos;m gonna fire his goddamn ass .
how was your shower ?
it was great . rachel ,
you don &apos;t have to clean up for me . i live here .
i know , i just ... i want everything to be perfect .
it is .
is this my parents &apos; photo album ?
oh , yeah , it was in the back of the closet .
yeah , i know where it was . why is it out here ?
because i was looking for
pictures of you .
what do you want to do for dinner tonight ?
i was thinking maybe we could hit
that little mexican spot .
no . you just got back here .
i don &apos;t want to go anywhere .
i don &apos;t either , but we don &apos;t have anything to eat .
don &apos;t we ?
well , i know for a fact
we don &apos;t have any bean and cheese burritos .
mm , then why are there six of them in the fridge right now ?
you hate them .
i do , but you love them , and
i wanted you to have them here when you came home .
and what if i didn &apos;t come home tonight ?
then i would have bought fresh ones again tomorrow .
thanks , rachel .
it &apos;s good to have you home .
it &apos;s good to be home .
what happened ?
i thought you had a date .
i canceled it , and i asked you a question .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it ,
because i know what you &apos;re going to say .
harvey , i don &apos;t even know what exactly louis did .
he broke the law to close forstman .
he broke it or forstman made him break it ?
what &apos;s the goddamn difference ?
harvey--
you don &apos;t have to say it , donna ,
i &apos;ve heard it a thousand times .
louis only did this to get my approval .
and you know what ,
i don &apos;t give a shit that i agreed to be his best man .
he put you , me , and every one of us in jeopardy
to get what he wanted .
well , i was gonna say that ,
but instead i &apos;ll say this :
you put us all in jeopardy too .
when the hell did i do that ?
the day you hired mike , and by the way ,
i &apos;m guessing he wouldn &apos;t even be back here
if louis hadn &apos;t done what he did .
then tell that to jessica , &apos; cause when it &apos;s over ,
she &apos;s gonna fire him .
they keep this place open late for you ?
ownership has its privileges .
what do you want , harvey ?
i want you to undo the dirty deal
you made with louis litt .
dirty deal . doesn &apos;t sound like me at all .
how does prison sound ?
because the s.e.c. is gonna get a record
of the shit you pulled tomorrow morning .
there is no record , &apos; cause i didn &apos;t do anything .
louis litt came to me ,
and he &apos;s the one who embezzled money .
and your grudge isn &apos;t with louis .
it &apos;s with me , so let him go .
live to fight me another day .
if i let him off , i let you off ,
and i don &apos;t think i want to do that .
then you &apos;re forcing me to turn you in
for what you did 12 years ago .
no way . you &apos;re not gonna do that ,
because you did it too , pal .
but if you did it to louis
and you did it to me ,
you did it to a hundred others .
and if you don &apos;t do what i &apos;m asking ,
i &apos;ll just have to find the one in a hundred
that &apos;s in a position to turn on you .
i &apos;ll take my chances , harvey .
now , get out of my face .
let me finish my cigar in peace .
you know ?
of course i do .
i never meant to--
louis ...
i understand why you did what you did .
you do ?
yes .
you went down a path with the best intentions ,
and then it just got worse and worse
until it was too late .
feel like shit .
and you should .
what ?
but you just said--
i understand ? i do .
but i don &apos;t think you understand
that every other time you screwed up , it was a mistake ,
and this time , it was a choice !
that &apos;s what harvey said .
of course that &apos;s what harvey said .
and just because i get what happened ,
it doesn &apos;t mean that you deserve to be let off the hook ,
so if you &apos;ve come in here to ask me
to go to him for the millionth time , i &apos;m--
no , i &apos;m not here for that .
then--then what are you here for ?
i &apos;m here to ask you if i &apos;m gonna get fired .
what ?
i saw how he looked at me , donna .
i know he trusts you ,
but i need to know if harvey &apos;s planning on firing me .
no , louis .
to my knowledge ,
harvey isn &apos;t planning to fire you .
thank you , donna .
i knew i could count on you .
can &apos;t remember the last time i saw you in here .
i can &apos;t remember the last time this firm faced prosecution .
i can . ava hessington .
and after that ,
we said it would never come to this again .
how the hell did it ?
we stepped into the ring with charles forstman .
i &apos;m guessing he didn &apos;t budge last night .
he didn &apos;t .
he sheltered himself ,
and he &apos;d rather laugh in my face
than be 100 % protected against the s.e.c.
you have a plan &quot; b &quot; ?
he doesn &apos;t , but i do .
what the hell is it ?
what would you do if you were cahill ?
go through every one of these boxes ,
and start deposing us .
okay , so what if while he &apos;s doing that ,
we start deposing him ?
did you come here to personally deliver my files ?
i came here to personally deliver this .
well , if it &apos;s an invitation to your birthday party ,
i think i &apos;m busy that day .
that &apos;s too bad . i promised the children a clown .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
you got judge hopkins to let you start depositions
on your malicious prosecution bullshit ?
he didn &apos;t think it was bullshit ,
which is why he &apos;s letting me start
with your boyfriend eric woodall .
you trying to take my eye off the ball , harvey ?
this is the ball , sean .
it &apos;s a wrecking ball , and it &apos;s headed your way .
louis , where the hell have you been ?
those documents are on their way over .
katrina , relax .
relax ?
the last time i saw you , you were worried
about going to prison .
what did you decide to do ?
i went to harvey and jessica ,
and i told them everything .
what ?
jessica said that i made a mistake ,
and they &apos;re working on a way out .
louis , have you seen any mafia movie ever made ?
i &apos;m not really a fan of the genre .
i find it to be a little offensive to italians--
shut up , and listen .
she &apos;s telling you to your face she &apos;ll let you live ,
but behind your back , she &apos;s making plans to whack you .
holy shit , i &apos;m living on borrowed time .
unless you fix this , because if you don &apos;t ,
even if jessica manages to keep you out of prison ,
she &apos;ll be coming to fire you .
jessica , i was just thinking about
our dinner plans tonight , and i think that ...
what &apos;s wrong ?
we &apos;re going after eric woodall .
harvey moved up the time line .
and since this is harvey &apos;s case now ...
why are you talking to me ?
&apos;cause i need you to find out every dirty thing
eric woodall has ever done , condoned , or been part of .
jessica , i really don &apos;t feel comfortable
participating in blackmail without knowing why .
it &apos;s not blackmail ,
it &apos;s evidence , and i &apos;ll tell you why .
because malicious prosecution is easier to prove
when there &apos;s a track record .
yeah , there &apos;s only one problem with that .
you see , just yesterday , we agreed to hand over our files
because we had nothing to hide ,
and now , you want me to go after the s.e.c. ,
which means we do .
jeff--
jessica , hide it from them all you want , okay ?
but we talked about this , and you said
that i shouldn &apos;t be treated like any other partner ,
so don &apos;t come in here hiding it from me .
you want a straight answer .
i &apos;ll give you a straight answer .
harvey did not collude with mike ross ,
but sean cahill doesn &apos;t give a shit about that .
so i need you to do whatever you have to
and get me something on these guys .
hey , how did cahill handle our surprise ?
actually , i got to hand it to him .
he handled it pretty damn well .
what ?
you guys had
your whole wonder twins riff ,
and now you &apos;re giving him respect ? what &apos;s next :
a time share in the florida keys ?
easy , tiger .
just saying , i got two words for you :
bro @-@ mance .
before you order us a gift off our registry ,
let me tell you what he &apos;s been up to .
he had judge hopkins sign off on his depositions ,
meaning
he &apos;s coming at us the same time we go after him .
we can handle it .
can rachel ?
what ?
take a look .
she &apos;s first on the list .
and you want me to tell her it &apos;s coming .
i want you to do more than that .
i want you to prep her .
harvey , that &apos;s not a good idea .
yes , it is--you &apos;re the best person for the job .
i am the worst person for the job .
and you &apos;re only saying it
because it makes you feel uncomfortable .
how do you think cahill &apos;s gonna make rachel feel
when he gets her under oath ?
usually , people don &apos;t start by washing their hands .
usually , people aren &apos;t here to talk about louis .
donna .
jessica , he made a mistake .
&quot; mistake &quot; implies that he did something by accident .
louis made a choice .
and you &apos;re making the choice to fire him
when this is over .
and how the hell is that any of your business ?
i just thought if louis could help get you out of it--
help get me out of it ?
he &apos;s the one that got me into it .
and if this were harvey ,
you &apos;d let him try to make up for it .
and if this were harvey ,
i &apos;d have the confidence that he would .
jessica , louis did all of this
because he is dying for your approval .
you never have confidence in him ,
and you never treat him the way you treat harvey .
so this is my fault ?
i &apos;m saying harvey &apos;s made mistakes ,
and you &apos;ve forgiven him .
i &apos;ve made mistakes , and you &apos;ve forgiven me .
you &apos;re right , donna , you did make a mistake once ,
and i did forgive you , but first i fired you .
and if you don &apos;t back off me right now ,
i will do it again .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have a deposition to get to .
please state your full name for the record .
eric ignatius woodall .
ignatius ?
like the saint .
i doubt that .
and how long have you worked for the s.e.c. ?
two months .
and where were you before that ?
i worked at the u.s. attorneys &apos; office .
until i got you fired for malicious prosecution .
you didn &apos;t get me fired .
you slandered me to a person in power ,
which caused me to leave a job i loved .
to avoid getting fired .
you have no proof of that , and he has no knowledge of that .
does he have any knowledge of his feelings towards me ?
i don &apos;t have any feelings for you , mr. specter ,
and for your information , i landed on my feet .
yes , we know , at the s.e.c. ,
but we don &apos;t want to talk about that .
we want to talk about jim pembry .
you don &apos;t seem too comfortable anymore , eric .
who &apos;s jim pembry ?
i worked with jim at the u.s. attorneys &apos; office .
on the arthur cohen prosecution ?
i believe he did some work for me .
you believe ? you sent him over 1,200 emails
on that case over four years .
if you say so .
actually , your computer records say so ,
and i could read them all , but
i &apos;d rather start with my favorite .
&quot; i don &apos;t care what we get arthur cohen on .
&quot; tax evasion , insider trading , jaywalking if we have to ,
but we &apos;re putting that piece of shit behind bars . &quot;
where the hell did you get that ?
it &apos;s not important where we got it ,
but that we got it .
emails get heated .
it was the middle of a case .
the problem is , eric ,
this was dated two years before
you even brought your big case .
do you have a question ?
i sure do .
you decide someone &apos;s guilty ,
then you find the crime to fit them .
isn &apos;t that true ?
no .
you want me to get you for perjury too ?
you tried to get arthur on one thing .
instead , you got him on another , didn &apos;t you ?
don &apos;t answer him .
yes .
and that &apos;s exactly what you want to do with me , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s enough . stop typing . we &apos;re done here .
to answer your question ...
don &apos;t--
you &apos;re damn right it is .
that &apos;s okay . it may not be on record , but
i got what i wanted .
you &apos;re not my usual guy .
i &apos;m not a usual anything .
no , you &apos;re not .
we got him , thanks to you .
thanks to jim pembry .
i &apos;m not here to celebrate with jim pembry .
jessica , we may have landed the first punch ,
but we &apos;re next up .
and cahill &apos;s gonna be brutal on us .
no , he isn &apos;t .
what do you mean ?
we &apos;re going to court tomorrow ,
and with any luck ,
we &apos;re gonna get this whole thing tossed
before he even has a chance to depose us .
well , then , maybe we should go to dinner .
i have a better idea .
let &apos;s order in .
miss zane , do you live with michael ross ,
the lawyer on the other side of this takeover ?
yes .
and , uh , and at any point during the takeover ,
did you discuss business with him ?
no .
you expect me to believe that ?
i don &apos;t care whether you believe it or not ,
because it &apos;s the truth .
the truth .
did you discuss logan sanders with mr. ross ?
yes .
i &apos;m confused . you just said that
you didn &apos;t discuss business with mr. ross ,
yet now you &apos;re saying that
you discussed the man on the other side of the takeover .
how can one of those be true and not the other ?
that wasn &apos;t about business .
then what was it about ?
it was about the fact that
i used to be involved with logan sanders .
and did you assure mr. ross
that you wouldn &apos;t become involved
with logan sanders again ?
what does that have to do with--
answer my question .
yes , i did .
and yet , over the course of the takeover ,
you did become involved with him again ,
didn &apos;t you ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
you had no physical contact of a sexual nature at all--
mike , please , i don &apos;t--
just answer my question .
we kissed once , and that was it .
did you sleep with him ?
he is not going to ask me--
you just lied . you said you weren &apos;t involved ,
and then you said you kissed him .
so i &apos;m gonna ask you again :
did you sleep with logan sanders
after you assured the man that you supposedly love
that you wouldn &apos;t become involved again ?
i &apos;m not gonna answer that ,
because it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with collusion .
it goes to credibility . it goes to
what you &apos;re capable of , whether a jury should trust you .
a jury or you ?
what difference does that make ?
the difference is you &apos;re the one that &apos;s doing it ,
because you don &apos;t trust me .
because harvey needs me to .
it is vicious , and it &apos;s cruel .
i am doing my job .
mike , i thought you were over this .
well , i &apos;m goddamn not !
i didn &apos;t sleep with logan .
i kissed him , and i hate myself for it .
mike , i &apos;m so sorry .
and i can apologize to you
every day for the rest of my life ,
but i @-@ i ...
i don &apos;t know what else to do ,
other than to tell you that ...
you mean more to me than anything in the world ,
and i need you to believe me .
i need you to believe me so that we can move on
and live our lives .
think that &apos;s enough questions for tonight .
louis , what the hell are you doing here ?
i read the eric woodall deposition ,
and i thought i could help .
help what ?
you &apos;re here to shut down sean cahill ,
and he &apos;s not gonna give up without a fight .
louis , i don &apos;t have time for this .
so take your arguments and get the hell out of here .
please , jessica , i want to help .
i don &apos;t need your help .
we &apos;re about to put this thing to bed .
and i feel responsible .
you are responsible .
you are the entire reason we are in jeopardy ,
and you want to sit your stupid face in front of cahill ?
you may as well wear a sign that says &quot; depose me next . &quot;
and if he does that , you will tumble like a house of cards ,
because you are ruled by your emotions ,
and that is the reason
why we are in this situation in the first place .
can i at least sit in the gallery ?
i don &apos;t care where you sit ,
but cahill &apos;s gonna be here in 30 seconds ,
so it better be far away from me .
what the hell is he doing here ?
the important thing is
that he &apos;s not sitting here anymore .
mr. cahill , this email makes a strong case
that eric woodall has a propensity for malicious prosecution .
yes , it does , your honor ,
but i &apos;m the one pursuing this case ,
not eric woodall ,
and i don &apos;t have a propensity for anything .
i &apos;m a simple man trying to do my job .
you expect us to believe that
the guy you came up with at the department of justice
comes over to the s.e.c. ,
and you immediately start coming after us ,
and it &apos;s a coincidence ?
doesn &apos;t take much to connect the dots here , your honor .
well , as long as we &apos;re connecting dots ,
i can connect a few too .
let &apos;s start with jeff malone .
a man who used to work at the s.e.c.
now conveniently works at pearson specter .
it &apos;s not against the law to change jobs .
yes , but why did he change jobs ?
because he was instructed to come after us
on behalf of the s.e.c.
so he says .
i think it &apos;s because he wanted to work with his girlfriend
jessica pearson .
excuse me ?
ms. pearson hired mr. malone ,
because if you &apos;re planning to break some rules ,
you need someone to navigate them for you .
who better to do that
than your boyfriend who works at the s.e.c. ?
that &apos;s ridiculous .
do you have any proof of this allegation ?
right here .
i can call you up to the stand , or we can do this right now .
were you seeing jeff malone
during the time that he worked for the s.e.c. ?
please let the record reflect ms. pearson said yes .
well , a romantic relationship isn &apos;t proof of a conspiracy ,
but it &apos;s not irrelevant .
i &apos;ll allow you to move forward with depositions .
i don &apos;t care what we have to do .
i &apos;m not losing to that son of a bitch .
despite what we just proved , you &apos;re not losing to him ,
you &apos;re losing to me .
and as far as depositions go ,
now it &apos;s our turn .
louis .
is there something i can help you with ?
i was just thinking
things were so much simpler
when i was in here .
yeah , louis ...
i know about you and jessica .
what ?
it came out in court .
see , i thought you were using me to get ahead ,
when you really just wanted to spend more time with jessica .
what are you doin &apos; in here , louis ?
i &apos;m here to apologize .
you wanted to be my friend , and i rejected you
because you were trying to protect her .
you must &apos;ve felt so alone .
and believe me ,
i know what it &apos;s like to feel alone .
you &apos;re not alone .
oh , i am .
jessica said that i &apos;m responsible
for everything that &apos;s happening ,
and she was right .
no one made me make that dirty deal with forstman ,
and now she won &apos;t forgive me .
i &apos;m alone .
and you want me to talk to her for you .
you &apos;re the only one i can go to , jeff .
and you &apos;re the closest person she has .
sure , louis .
i &apos;ll talk to jessica for you .
you &apos;re off the hook with cahill .
he &apos;s gonna start with me and harvey in the morning .
am i ?
are you what ?
off the hook .
rachel ...
i didn &apos;t mean for what happened to happen .
but it did .
i know .
mike--
i still haven &apos;t gotten
a full night &apos;s sleep since you told me .
i know that you &apos;re not completely over it .
but things are gonna come up , and i--
want me to not be vicious and cruel .
do you think that &apos;s possible ?
i hope so .
i hope so too .
if it means anything ,
i haven &apos;t gotten a good night &apos;s sleep
since any of this happened either .
maybe we can both give it a shot tonight .
let &apos;s start with one for you , mr. ross .
were you on good terms with him when you left ?
yes .
oh .
well , then , why weren &apos;t you representing him
on the gillis industries takeover ?
because he wasn &apos;t technically our client at the time .
well , if you &apos;re on such good terms ,
why wasn &apos;t he a client ?
because sometimes brothers fight .
and sometimes they pretend to fight .
what are you getting at ?
i &apos;m getting at the fact that you supposedly
were fighting when this thing started ,
yet you claim that you weren &apos;t fighting when it ended .
who says we weren &apos;t fighting when it ended ?
you did , when you hired him back .
yeah , and the cowboys signed deion sanders ,
even though they were rivals .
you want to know why ?
&apos;cause he was awesome ,
and they were tired of him intercepting their passes .
he didn &apos;t intercept passes for you .
he fumbled the ball .
bullshit . he hit it out of the park .
what park are you playing at ?
he sides with walter gillis , buys a ton of shares ,
then ditches poor walter ,
and then walks away from the whole thing .
why would you even want a guy like this on your team ?
what am i missing ?
you &apos;re missing the fact that he kicked ass his first time out ,
and anybody would be lucky to have him .
then why didn &apos;t anybody take him ?
what ?
i checked with every major law firm in the city ,
and not one of them received a resume from you .
why is that ? because it &apos;s clear as day .
you &apos;re hiding something , and i &apos;ll tell you what it is .
it &apos;s because you always knew that he was coming back
because you and he were in this together the whole time .
the problem with your theory is
neither one of us got a nickel from this
alleged collusion ,
and you &apos;ve got no proof we did .
yeah , and you &apos;re never gonna find any ,
because it doesn &apos;t exist .
so you &apos;re both insisting that neither one of you
got any money ?
damn right .
that tells me that someone else did .
thank you , gentlemen .
i believe you showed me where i should focus my manpower .
somewhere in those files
there &apos;s a payment from somewhere to someone ,
and i &apos;m gonna find it ,
because you can &apos;t hide money from the s.e.c.
son of a bitch .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
tell you what ?
about louis making a dirty deal with forstman .
he told you .
he thought i already knew .
he found out we were together ,
and unlike you , he assumed that people in relationships
share shit like that .
goddamn ticking time bomb .
do you hear yourself ?
i &apos;m coming to you with a problem between you and me ,
and you &apos;re focused on louis .
i &apos;m focused on louis because right now his actions
threaten this entire firm .
which brings me right back to where we started .
why didn &apos;t you tell me about louis
when i asked you what the dirt on woodall was for ?
i didn &apos;t tell you
because i didn &apos;t want you in the position of
having to lie for me in a deposition .
is that &quot; focused on you and me &quot; enough ?
jessica ...
when are you gonna understand
that i can handle crossing lines ,
but i won &apos;t handle you lying to me ?
now , how much trouble are we in ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna find out .
louis , did you see this ?
no , what is it ?
it &apos;s cahill &apos;s deposition with harvey and mike .
skip to the end .
jesus christ , he &apos;s honing in like a bloodhound .
it &apos;s only a matter of time .
there &apos;s got to be a way we can get this filed--
there isn &apos;t .
louis .
i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m done .
and if i don &apos;t do something now ,
so are harvey and mike .
where are you going ?
to finish what i started .
you know what i think ?
what ?
i think we both could &apos;ve used a better lawyer
in that deposition .
you think this is funny ?
no , i don &apos;t .
then help me figure a way out ,
because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re gonna find out about louis ,
and everything cahill &apos;s been saying about us
is gonna start looking true .
we have to stop cahill from going through those files .
we tried that .
we have to try again .
we have to prove that cahill is only on this investigation
because woodall hates you .
the problem is we don &apos;t have a link between them .
and they have a link between jessica and malone .
so we &apos;d have to convince judge hopkins
their relationship has nothing to do with this whole thing ,
which ... we &apos;ll never be able to do .
how do they even know about jessica and malone ?
i don &apos;t know . someone at the s.e.c.
must &apos;ve seen them together while malone was still working there .
you think they were holding hands ?
come on , harvey , this is jessica we &apos;re talking about .
talking about me , what ?
holy shit , you &apos;re right .
she was married , and i didn &apos;t even know it .
cahill had us followed without authorization .
and there &apos;s no way he had authorization
to follow a government official .
you need to pay that man a visit .
i need to pay that man a visit .
yep .
oh , sorry , maybe you didn &apos;t hear the news .
jeff malone doesn &apos;t work here anymore .
and i &apos;m guessing you know exactly where he is ,
since you &apos;ve been following him for months .
i haven &apos;t been following him at all .
i &apos;ve been following you .
well , it doesn &apos;t really matter who you followed ,
since there &apos;s no way you got authorization .
you think judge hopkins is going to look into
those dreamy brown eyes of yours
and drop the case because of that ?
no , i think you &apos;re gonna drop it .
&apos;cause if you don &apos;t ,
it &apos;s no longer malicious prosecution .
it &apos;s abuse of power .
you did it to mike ross , you did it to me .
and we &apos;re gonna find out who else you did it to .
take a shot .
it &apos;ll take you two years to make a case .
and even if it sticks , i &apos;ll get a slap on the wrist ,
but harvey specter will already be in prison .
you dirty son of a bitch .
dirty ?
i may bend the rules , but i &apos;m doing it because you are guilty .
that &apos;s exactly what eric woodall said
before we got his ass fired .
well , i &apos;ll tell you what i told harvey .
i &apos;m not eric woodall ,
and sending some guy named louis litt
to confess to some fabricated bullshit
isn &apos;t gonna make me stop .
it &apos;s gonna make me come at you harder .
maybe no news is good news .
all right , maybe no news means bad news .
when it comes to jessica , no news is no news .
harvey , you have a minute ?
what do you want , louis ?
i &apos;d prefer to tell you alone .
mike knows everything , so spit it out .
okay , um , but i think you both should know
that whatever happens to me ,
i had the dignity to come to you and tell you like a man .
what did you do ?
he did exactly what i told him not to do .
he went to the s.e.c. , and he confessed .
wait , jessica , please .
please what ? don &apos;t kill you ?
because one thing is for sure .
when all this is over , i &apos;m gonna fire the shit out of you .
fire me ?
you should be thanking me .
i read the transcript .
cahill knows about the hidden payment .
i went there to save all of you !
and i told you the second you did that ,
these two go from being probably innocent
to definitely guilty .
goddamn idiot .
wait a second . we--
louis , if you confessed , then why are you here ?
they sent me home .
what ?
what exactly did you say to cahill ?
i didn &apos;t talk to cahill .
i mean , i was in his office ,
but then eric woodall comes in , takes me down the hall .
i confessed to him .
you told the head of the s.e.c.
you committed a federal crime , and he sent you on your way ?
yes .
and he didn &apos;t try to get you to implicate harvey ?
no , in fact ,
he didn &apos;t seem to care at all .
and you specifically told him about your deal with forstman ?
yeah . he said they &apos;re not interested in little fish like me .
you might be a little fish to him ,
but forstman is a goddamn whale .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
woodall hates me : i &apos;m the one he wants .
but why not use forstman to reel you in
and get two for the price of one ?
unless for some reason
woodall doesn &apos;t want to drag forstman into this .
because they &apos;re in bed together .
that &apos;s a big leap .
harvey , you said you told forstman
the s.e.c. was on his ass ,
and he acted like he was wearing a teflon suit .
he acted the same way with me .
and when assholes act invincible ,
it &apos;s because they think they are .
it &apos;s the only thing that makes sense .
you two find the link between those two ,
and find it tonight .
this could be something .
look .
in april of last year ,
charles forstman made huge contributions to these three senators .
so what ? he &apos;s got money to burn .
yeah , but four weeks later ,
these same senators helped appoint eric woodall
to head the new york office of the s.e.c.
that doesn &apos;t prove a direct link
between forstman and woodall .
it &apos;s still a link , harvey .
and it &apos;s how this shit works .
it &apos;s totally legal , and it &apos;s not gonna do a thing for us .
well , what do you want ?
a picture of him handing woodall a bag of money ?
because we &apos;re never gonna get that .
maybe we don &apos;t need it .
you better be here with something good .
i am .
charles forstman made me take a million dollars
to keep from turning on him .
what if he made woodall take a taste too ?
you think we don &apos;t know that ?
that &apos;s the &quot; bag of money &quot; problem .
it wouldn &apos;t be a bag of money ,
because if it &apos;s untraceable ,
he wouldn &apos;t have leverage over woodall .
that &apos;s great , but we can &apos;t get access
to woodall &apos;s bank accounts .
we can &apos;t .
but cahill can .
okay , what good does that do us , huh ?
they &apos;re together .
what if they &apos;re not ?
i told you , i went to see cahill .
he wasn &apos;t there .
five minutes later , eric woodall shows up .
i say two words : &quot; charles forstman . &quot;
he hustles me outta there like i &apos;m his mistress
with his wife coming up the driveway .
why would he not wait for cahill ?
you want us to get cahill to turn on woodall .
damn right i do .
maybe louis is right .
maybe there are lines that woodall &apos;s willing to cross
that cahill won &apos;t .
that &apos;s a big &quot; maybe . &quot;
you have a better idea ?
no , i don &apos;t .
look , guys , we all know that jessica &apos;s gonna fire me after this .
i just want to help ,
make things right .
get your coat .
you really looking through those all by yourself ?
are the witches of eastwick here to tell me
how to run my department ?
we &apos;re here to make things easier for you .
buried in one of these boxes is a copy of this .
it proves collusion .
not between me and mike .
between him and charles forstman .
and you &apos;re just gonna give this to me ?
yup .
and you &apos;re gonna give it to woodall ,
and we &apos;re gonna see what he says .
and what he &apos;s gonna say is that he doesn &apos;t give a shit
about charles forstman ,
just like he told me when i confessed to him .
what exactly are you implying ?
we &apos;re not implying anything .
we &apos;re telling you that after woodall lost his job ,
forstman got him installed at the s.e.c. ,
and all he had to do in return was protect forstman .
where &apos;s the proof ?
in eric woodall &apos;s bank accounts .
oh , so you want me to go through his bank accounts
based on your word .
you followed us based on his bullshit .
based on the word of my friend .
why don &apos;t you ask your friend if he has a problem
giving you access to his accounts ?
if he doesn &apos;t , then we &apos;re wrong ,
and we &apos;ve just handed you the smoking gun .
and if you &apos;re right , you want me to let him
off the hook for what he did .
woodall already said he &apos;s a little fish .
we &apos;re asking you to throw him back in the water .
what the hell &apos;s going on in here ?
hey , eric .
it &apos;s good to see you again .
sean , isn &apos;t this great that we &apos;re all together ?
did you see me come in ?
afraid of what i &apos;d say ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
eric , these gentlemen came in here
with these wild accusations
that you and charles forstman are in bed together .
a bed filled with forstman &apos;s money .
yes , charles forstman gave me millions of dollars .
that &apos;s why i drive a subaru .
yeah , i didn &apos;t spend the money he gave me either .
that doesn &apos;t mean he didn &apos;t make me take it .
i don &apos;t give a shit . i &apos;m not you .
eric , obviously these allegations are crazy .
of course they are .
so just ...
prove it to &apos; em you &apos;ve got nothing to hide .
this is ridiculous .
i ... am not gonna dignify ...
i &apos;m your boss .
gentlemen , give me a minute .
yep .
and by a minute , he means 10 to 15 years .
in about a half an hour , you &apos;re gonna need
a really good lawyer .
and when that happens ,
don &apos;t call me .
which lawyer do you think woodall called ?
well , if he was smart , he would call daniel hardman .
the best person to defend a criminal is a criminal .
and hardman &apos;s a much better lawyer than you anyways .
oh , very funny .
thank you .
thank you , louis .
please .
i &apos;ll try .
donna told me she already said this to you ,
but i want you to hear it from me .
i wouldn &apos;t be back here if it wasn &apos;t for louis .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
woodall &apos;s taken care of , and so is everything else .
not everything .
jessica--
harvey , i &apos;ve already made up my mind .
you weren &apos;t there . he helped get us out of this .
after he put us goddamn in it .
and i put us in it just as much ,
the day i hired mike ross .
are you looking to save louis ,
or to get yourself fired too ?
i &apos;m saying he did some bad shit ,
but so have i , and so have you .
you and i don &apos;t mess shit up .
we fix it .
which is what he did today .
you want to talk about what he did ?
i told him not to confess , and he went straight down
to the s.e.c. , and he sang like a canary ,
after he did the same thing with jeff malone .
that doesn &apos;t--
doesn &apos;t what ?
that &apos;s just the tip of the iceberg .
let &apos;s talk about his greatest hits .
last year , he blew up our merger negotiations
because of a cat .
this year , he led mike ross straight to charles forstman .
he unwound the wexler shares
after i specifically told him not to ,
and to top it all off ,
he took a million @-@ dollar payout to commit tax fraud
that could &apos;ve landed you ten years in jail .
and he didn &apos;t tell us about that until it was too late ,
and he only did that because he had to .
i &apos;m still not doin &apos; it .
i tell him to do something ,
and he never goddamn does it .
now , i told myself i &apos;m gonna do something .
and i &apos;m gonna goddamn do it .
then let me do it .
why you and not me ?
because you want to deliver the message
&quot; his services are no longer needed , &quot;
and i want to tell him &quot; good @-@ bye . &quot;
you &apos;re really going to do this ?
harvey , this place is all he has .
i know .
i &apos;m coming with you .
dear harvey and jessica ,
there comes a time
when a man must look at himself in the mirror ,
to judge himself instead of waiting to be judged by others .
and for me , that time is now .
you both know i came to pearson specter
right out of law school , but what you may not know is
this is the only place i &apos;ve ever worked .
it &apos;s the only place i &apos;ve ever wanted to work .
it is my life ...
it is my home ...
and the people that work here are my family .
you &apos;re like my parents .
and the partners , they &apos;re like my brothers ,
and associates under my care are like my children .
and i &apos;m ashamed to admit it , but ...
i put all of you in jeopardy for my own personal gain .
i told myself it was for the greater good ,
but the truth is i just wanted to feel
on the same level as both of you , i ...
i can deny that no longer .
i can excuse my actions no longer .
although we &apos;ve had our differences over the years ,
there are no two people i respect more .
your names are on the wall for a reason ,
and mine is not for a reason .
and i refuse to put either one of you
through the pain of having a fire .
so ... effective immediately ,
i , louis litt ,
am resigning from pearson specter .
please take care of my home .
