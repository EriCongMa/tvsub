back in the &apos; 80s , my mom forced us
to take the most embarrassing family photos in human history .
did we agree because we loved her ?
oh , god , no . we did it &apos; cause she guilted us .
this is so brutal .
but one day
when you abandon me in an old @-@ age home and never visit ,
you &apos;ll look at these pictures
and remember how much i loved you .
now , everybody say &quot; mahalo . &quot;
mahalo !
and her guilting wasn &apos;t just for family photos .
it was for family everything .
baby , if you don &apos;t eat ,
then i have failed as a mother .
i &apos;m gonna die one day , but have fun with your friends .
when i die , don &apos;t have a funeral .
i don &apos;t want to take up anybody &apos;s time .
and then there was her signature guilt move .
if we were driving and she didn &apos;t get her way ,
she &apos;d jump out of the car and threaten to walk home .
get back in the car , mom !
we want to have a picnic with you , okay ?
yeah !
i &apos;m so stoked to eat chicken salad on the ground !
well , if that &apos;s what you want , then ... yay ! picnic !
yep . it was her guilt world , and we were just living in it .
hey , where are the car keys ?
we &apos;re gonna grab a bite before the movie .
movie ?
i thought we had plans to bedazzle all day .
i ... think you might have dreamed that .
well , it &apos;s possible , but we &apos;re all set up ,
so let &apos;s make those drab clothes sparkle , huh ?
oh , no . what is that ? !
oh , my god !
it &apos;s a harlequin clown riding a unicorn high @-@ fiving a dolphin .
duh .
yeah ... i think we &apos;re gonna pass on the debazzler .
okay , now you &apos;re just embarrassing yourself .
it &apos;s bedazzler , as in regular items become dazzled .
and if you don &apos;t want to do that ,
i &apos;ll just join you at the movie .
no way !
oh , my god !
come on .
i hardly ever get to see you anymore ,
and you &apos;re both growing up so fast ,
and ... you did promise we &apos;d spend the day together .
again , that was a dream .
it &apos;ll be fun .
afterwards , we can grab a bite , split a giant cookie ,
you can ride the little mall train if you &apos;re still into it .
ain &apos;t no thang .
okay , here is the thang .
no .
wow . i am being rejected
by two people who were tethered to my body for nine months
by a food cord .
that &apos;s right .
everything i ate you got a tiny , mushed @-@ up version of .
everything !
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s how science works .
you know what ? go .
i &apos;m not even sad . i &apos;m great .
aw , come on .
not the little pack of tissues !
mom tears are the worst tears ever !
fine . well , if we have no choice ...
oh , that &apos;s so sweet !
and don &apos;t you worry .
i promise you won &apos;t even notice i &apos;m there .
hey , check out my new jacket .
oh , no !
oh , my god !
it was may 11 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my dad was pumped to spend the day
with his one true love -- the phillies .
hello , wonderful family ,
who i &apos;m not gonna be seeing for the next six glorious hours !
wait . where are you going ?
to the phillies game with vic .
you never told me that . did you mark it in the calendar ?
you have a calendar ? where &apos;s this calendar ?
it &apos;s on my desk .
wait -- you &apos;ve got a desk ?
where &apos;s this desk ?
you can &apos;t go .
erica and barry have graciously invited me
to see a scary / sexy teen @-@ vampire movie .
who is gonna watch the baby ?
is that me ?
it is .
i told you -- i &apos;m not the baby ! i &apos;m a grown , adult man !
and could you please start this orange ?
come on , bevy !
can &apos;t the boy stay home alone for the day ?
i mean , he is 11 -- or 14 or whatever .
no !
the last time i went out power @-@ walking ,
i came home and found him hiding in the broom closet .
see , that &apos;s on you , &apos; cause you bought a house with a ghost .
again with the ghost . there are no ghosts !
sure .
people don &apos;t die with unfinished business .
must be nice to live in your world .
okay .
we &apos;re going to the ballgame . go get your glove .
my michael jackson glove or my nintendo power glove ?
really ?
and so , my dad took me to watch the phillies play
at old veterans stadium ,
a beautiful world @-@ class arena --
when it was built .
now it was falling apart at the seams ,
but we loved it anyway .
dad , i got to pee .
well , the bathroom &apos;s right up there .
go ahead .
you want me to go by myself ?
yeah .
forget what your mother said . you &apos;re not a baby .
now stop acting like a moron and go !
but i didn &apos;t have the guts ,
so my dad took me , like the little moron baby i was .
the men &apos;s room at veterans stadium
was a nightmarish hellscape of people and pee everywhere .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a trough .
aim for a cigarette butt and make a game of it .
but w @-@ where &apos;s the dividers ?
where &apos;s the handle to flush ? !
where &apos;s the dignity , man ? !
if you don &apos;t like it , use the stall .
mother of mercy .
what happened in there ?
it &apos;s on the walls .
it &apos;s on the walls .
please hurry it up .
i feel weird being in here not doing anything .
in that moment ,
i had what all men experience at one point or another --
stage fright .
i couldn &apos;t go .
my mind said yes , but my bladder said no .
i &apos;m done .
let &apos;s get the hell out of here
so i can breathe through my nose again .
while i was running away from my fears ,
barry and erica were sitting through a real horror show ,
and i don &apos;t mean the movie .
so , which boy is lost ?
his poor mother must be going insane .
oh ! i snuck in some snacks .
got microwave popcorn , some chips ,
and a beautiful tomato .
i don &apos;t want a tomato !
well , it &apos;s the last day before it turns .
somebody &apos;s gonna eat it .
this has been the best day .
yeah . it &apos;s a real shame it &apos;s over .
oh , it doesn &apos;t have to be .
i &apos;m gonna make us a dinner reservation at red lobster .
now , it &apos;s not lobstober or shrimptember or clamuary ,
so you &apos;re gonna have to order carefully .
what the hell happened out there ?
mom happened .
whew . you know , she guilted us into hanging out with her again .
you know , it is seriously not normal for teenagers
to spend this much time with their mothers .
i rode the train , man !
i rode the tiny train !
look .
she took a picture and everything !
okay , i can &apos;t watch you suffer like this anymore .
follow me . i &apos;m about to change your lives .
how ?
i &apos;m gonna teach you how to defeat your mother .
it &apos;s natural for teenagers to separate from their parents .
but your mother loves you so much ,
she &apos;ll never let that happen .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s my job to --
why are you wearing that outfit ?
you &apos;re gonna teach us how to fight mom , right ?
no ! i &apos;m gonna teach you to combat her guilt .
ohhhh ! that makes more sense .
should i go change back ?
just focus on me . he &apos;ll get what he gets .
if you &apos;ve noticed ,
when your mom tries to guilt me , it doesn &apos;t work .
that &apos;s because of my simple mantra --
&quot; it &apos;s not real . don &apos;t feel . &quot;
what &apos;s not real ?
the pain she &apos;s in .
her guilt and tears are just a manipulation .
don &apos;t fall for it .
pops , if your thing was so easy ,
we would have done it a long time ago .
oh , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m just a silly old man .
i @-@ i should just go home , ball up my socks , and go to bed .
no , don &apos;t . i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t do that ! we love you !
it &apos;s not real ! don &apos;t feel !
wait . that was just an act ?
yes !
my god , you &apos;re weak and soft !
say it with me . &quot; it &apos;s not real . don &apos;t feel . &quot;
it &apos;s not real . don &apos;t feel .
louder !
it &apos;s not real ! don &apos;t feel !
not that loud .
she &apos;ll hear you , and then we &apos;re all in trouble .
as my brother and sister were learning to fight back ,
i was battling the 64 ounces of mountain dew in my bladder !
dad , i have to pee again .
what ? you just went !
all right , i &apos;m not gonna sugarcoat this .
my bladder shut down .
there &apos;s too much pressure at the trough .
well , why don &apos;t you use the damn stall ?
don &apos;t speak of the stall -- ever !
well , it &apos;s too late . the bases are loaded .
i &apos;m not taking you again . so just go !
isn &apos;t there some private executive washroom
with scented soaps instead of a giant metal river of whiz ? !
when will the hand @-@ holding end , already ? !
for once in your life , be a man .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m a man ?
all right , let me answer that question with this question .
what superhero is on your underwear right now ?
i outgrew those months ago !
i &apos;ll show you ! i &apos;ll go !
go !
fine ! i &apos;m going !
good ! you &apos;re doing what i want you to do !
sure , i was mad at my dad ,
but mostly i was mad at myself , &apos; cause he was right .
so i set out to prove my manhood once and for all ,
and the first step was going potty by myself !
nope .
excuse me . which way to the upper level ?
i &apos;m thinking the higher you go , the fancier it gets .
so i headed up to what i figured was the super @-@ fancy 700 level .
not fancy . not fancy .
i finally gave up and headed back to my seats .
just one problem --
i had no idea where my seats were .
oh , balls !
early @-@ bird dinner was over , and erica and barry
had been with my mom for six straight hours .
she was going for seven .
wow . i am stuffed .
what do you say we go home
and burn off some of these calories with a little bedazzling ?
ugh ! make it stop !
it &apos;s too much time with you !
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m done .
if spending time with your mother is some kind of torture ,
then i &apos;ll just walk home .
stop the car .
and there it was , her signature guilt move --
storming out of the car and making us beg her to come back .
here i go .
i &apos;ll probably get flattened by a truck , not that you &apos;d care .
aw , man ! she &apos;s out of the car !
now what do we do ?
nothing .
remember what pops said ? &quot; it &apos;s not real . don &apos;t feel . &quot;
i &apos;m walking !
we should just drive off and let her walk home .
you heard her .
she could be flattened by a truck !
she &apos;s not a squirrel !
we &apos;re 10 minutes from home . she &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;m walking .
all right , we need to take a stand and drive away .
are you with me ?
i don &apos;t know !
still walking !
i need you to look me in the eye
and say you are with me .
i &apos;m with you !
god save my soul , i &apos;m with you !
i knew you &apos;d come to your senses .
we &apos;re doing it ! this is really happening !
i &apos;ve never felt so alive in my life !
as my brother and sister were flying high ,
my dad was crashing down to reality .
damn it . where is he ?
see , back before cellphones ,
getting lost was a much bigger deal .
i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s all gonna be fine .
s @-@ so i &apos;m hungry and alone and may never be rescued .
it &apos;s good times .
the only way to actually find someone
was to shout their name really loud .
adam ? !
when that didn &apos;t work , my dad decided to
awkwardly approach anyone who even looked a little like me .
tiny lady . sorry .
meanwhile , the more i ran around , the more lost i got .
luckily , my dad came up with the perfect plan
to track me down .
whoa , whoa . slow it down there , boss .
that &apos;s a restricted area .
yeah , yeah -- i got separated from my son ,
and i need to make an announcement to the entire stadium .
okay , that makes sense .
this kid of yours -- what &apos;s he look like ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s a boy . he &apos;s normal @-@ looking .
he &apos;s got hair , a face .
i @-@ i don &apos;t look at him much .
uh @-@ huh . and , uh , how old is this boy ?
11 .
or ... 14 .
can i just go make my announcement ? !
oh , yeah , sure .
and after , you want to visit the dugout
or shower in the locker room ?
very funny .
hey , how are your fielding skills ?
you want to play shortstop ?
just know i will make it through that door .
better yet , why don &apos;t i have two of my friends escort you
to the v.i.p. section ?
my kid &apos;s in there !
while my dad had hit an all @-@ time low ,
barry and erica were riding high .
dude , we did it !
for once , we didn &apos;t give in to her guilt !
i know ! we totally drove away !
i feel so exhilarated , like i just killed a man !
exactly !
wait . what ?
pops , we did just like you said with mom .
way to go , kiddos . i want to hear all about it .
you know that thing mom does when she storms out of the car
and then you have to beg her to get back in ?
oh , yeah -- the big guns .
well , we left her on the side of the road like an old mattress !
boom !
what ? are you nuts ? !
you don &apos;t leave your mother on the side of the road !
who does that ?
that &apos;s exactly what you said to do .
that &apos;s not what i said at all !
why are you making us feel guilty ?
i thought you were on our side !
my god ! what have you done ? !
everybody just chill , okay ?
that &apos;s her . she &apos;s fine .
evening .
it was the old man ! he put us up to it !
they misunderstood my rhyme !
it doesn &apos;t matter .
is our mom okay ?
she &apos;s fine . i gave her a lift .
lucky for her , i was driving down old york road
and was temporarily blinded
by the sunlight reflecting off of her bejeweled jacket .
where is she ?
in the back of my cruiser with a little pack of tissues .
she &apos;s pretty certain she failed as a mother .
i know this looks bad ,
but you have to understand she uses guilt to get her way .
so ... she &apos;s like every mom .
except in this case ,
you abandoned her on the side of the road .
shame on you .
shame .
thank you for seeing me home safely , officer .
it was very kind .
you must be a wonderful son .
mom --
bup @-@ bup @-@ bup .
i have one thing to say to you .
that was up .
only one person felt worse than barry and erica -- my dad .
he was so desperate to find me
that he sought help in the most unlikely of places --
a parking lot full of philly tailgaters .
you guys got an extra ticket you could sell me ?
i @-@ i got tossed out of the stadium .
i need to get back in .
why &apos;d you get ejected , chief ?
um , i got into it with a security guard
because i lost my son .
in veterans stadium ?
damn , that is just some bad parenting right there .
i never let my little fella out of my sight .
tell you what .
let me c.b. the other camps around the stadium ,
see if anybody &apos;s seen your kid .
wow . you &apos;d do that ?
well , t @-@ thank you .
it &apos;s what phillies fans do .
so , how old is he ? what does he look like ?
why &apos;s everybody need to know that ? !
hey . i @-@ i &apos;m kind of lost .
could you please help me find my dad ?
of course we can help you find your dad .
why don &apos;t you step over there with the other lost kids ?
as i looked at that line of lost little tykes ,
i knew i couldn &apos;t join them .
i finally had to man up
and become the 11- or 14 @-@ year @-@ old
my dad wanted me to be .
no !
not today !
i &apos;m lost , i &apos;m starving , and i still haven &apos;t peed ,
but i will survive !
as i was finally confronting
the most disgusting bathroom in the world ,
erica and barry were about to face
the most emotionally manipulative mother in the universe .
hey , mama .
i don &apos;t think she heard you . do it again .
oh , stop it . i heard you . i &apos;m just not answering .
we feel horrible .
and we made a little peace offering
to show you how sorry we are .
it &apos;s a picture of you .
see ?
you &apos;re smiling , like you used to
before we ditched you on the side of the road like human trash .
your shading and tones don &apos;t quite capture my loving essence ,
but i appreciate the effort .
maybe you could teach us .
how does that sound ?
we bedazzle for the rest of the day .
well , that &apos;s a good first step ,
but it &apos;s gonna take a lot more than rhinestones and glitter
to make up for what you did .
name it . anything .
i want huggies .
fine .
and snuggies .
on it .
and kissies .
absolutely .
and nubbies .
lots and lots of nubbies .
i don &apos;t know what that is , and i &apos;m scared to find out ,
but sure .
we &apos;re gonna go set up the bedazzler .
we &apos;ll meet you upstairs .
and just like that , my mother realized
that getting abandoned on the side of the road
was the best thing that could have happened to her .
mom , are you coming ?
i &apos;ll be there in a minute .
it was the bottom of the ninth .
i was still lost , but at least i wasn &apos;t alone .
i guess i just really want to show my dad what i &apos;m made of , you know ?
in here .
does that make sense ?
okay , you &apos;ve done that three times .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
as i was getting annoyed with my new green friend ,
barry and erica were bedazzling
with all the colors of the rainbow .
what &apos;s all this ?
oh , just a bunch of bedazzmanian devils going crazy !
it &apos;s been a fun hour .
you know what ? we &apos;re out of silver studs .
i &apos;m gonna go get some from my craft drawer .
yes ! we need more .
this is so fun !
help us .
i &apos;m sorry . you hurt her for real .
you got to pay the price .
but we bedazzled everything .
look .
i even bedazzled my flyers jersey ,
and , in some weird way , i think it looks amazing .
and what are nubbies ?
what are nubbies ? !
she said &quot; nubbies &quot; ?
oh , you &apos;re way too old for that .
i &apos;ll talk to her .
bevy , listen ,
the kids don &apos;t deserve all the blame for what they did .
i may have taught them how to stand up to your guilt .
that was you ?
thank you so much .
thank you for this wonderful gift .
w @-@ wait . what &apos;s happening ? y @-@ you &apos;re not angry ?
this is literally my dream come true .
now they &apos;re under my thumb forever .
i get to decide how they live , who they marry ,
where they take me on vacation ,
and all because they left me on the side of the road .
honey , you can &apos;t hold them hostage with guilt
for the rest of their lives .
they &apos;re just gonna end up resenting you .
but ... what else am i supposed to do ?
i &apos;m their mom .
if it were up to them , they &apos;d never spend time with me .
have you ever wondered
why they love hanging out with me so much ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t force them to .
also , i &apos;m pretty frickin &apos; delightful .
you are pretty delightful .
and so are you .
put the stud guns down . you &apos;re free to go .
no , really . we &apos;re having fun .
you &apos;re not .
you &apos;ve done this long enough , and we &apos;re even .
but we &apos;re just trying to apologize for what we did .
no , i &apos;m the one who needs to apologize .
i guilt you kids way too much .
it &apos;s just , uh ...
when you were little ,
all you wanted to do was spend time with me .
and , you know , a mom gets used to that .
you two will never understand
how much it hurts when that goes away .
i think that &apos;s just the way things are right now .
you know , we really meant what we bedazzled .
we do love you .
i know .
just no nubbies .
deal .
while my mom had found common ground with barry and erica ,
i still hadn &apos;t found my dad .
but we weren &apos;t out of options .
back then , whenever you got lost ,
the last resort was always the same -- meet at the car .
of course , i had no idea where we were parked ,
so i had to wait until every single car was gone .
i was ready to give my dad hell .
i wanted to tell him how i survived on my own
and proved him wrong .
i wanted to tell him i was a man .
i wanted to tell him that i didn &apos;t need him anymore .
but ... instead , i did this .
i know .
you &apos;re safe .
you &apos;re safe .
i spent most of that day lost ,
but what i remember most is what i found .
i found out that i could do okay on my own ,
and my dad discovered he didn &apos;t want me to grow up too fast .
hey , ma .
back from another normal day .
well , come into the nook .
it &apos;s &quot; battle of the network stars . &quot;
fonzie sure can throw a javelin .
that &apos;s the thing about parents --
they always drive you crazy .
oh . got a beautiful tomato if you &apos;re hungry .
mom , enough with the tomato .
someone &apos;s gonna eat this thing today .
but in a world where we all get lost sometimes ...
stop ! stop , mom !
kissy shark ! kissy shark !
stop ! stop it !
... there &apos;s nothing better
than having people who love you so much ,
they never want to let you go .
no ! no , no , no ! mom , mom !
1971年 @-@ 2004年
three ... two ... fire !
whoa ! what is that ?
oh , you mean the shirt ?
i &apos;m going to the phillies game later with dad ,
so i bedazzled this as a joke just to drive him crazy .
i mean , i would never wear this to the game .
unless you think i could maybe wear it to the game .
you know , you shouldn &apos;t just wear it to the game .
i would wear it to school .
that &apos;s what i thought ! thank you !
i mean , this is a joke , but -- but thank you !
