The doctor said the stroke did no permanent damage,
so if you just keep taking...
So, where am I going?
The luncheon, remember?
Yes, where am I going afterwards?
Oh, home-- I set up a room for you upstairs.
Your house?
Yeah.
Won't Alicia have a problem with that?
I don't think so.
Mr. Gold.
Oh. Eli?
Hold on. One second, Mom.
How's she doing?
Well, she's getting him to commit to a timeline.
Good, uh, anything more on that campaign worker--
what's her name?
Indira Starr.
I have the investigator on the other line,
double-checking the dates.
Oh, good. Who's the investigator?
Kalinda.
Should I not?
Uh, no, no, no, it's fine.
So, how are we doing on the straw poll?
Uh, you'll win it. It's just a question of
whether the press think you've won it by enough.
Okay, well, keep me in the loop.
Well, let's get you to that luncheon.
Peter, what's going on?
Nothing's the matter, Mom.
It's obviously something.
It's just a story
we want to keep from being written, that's all.
Somebody... is lying about me.
About you and some campaign worker?
Yeah.
And Alicia's hurting you?
No-- what are you talking about? No.
I don't believe you.
Mother, Alicia has been great.
She's with the press right now,
trying to keep the story from being printed.
And this happened when?
You seem to answer questions with questions, Mrs. Florrick.
Yes, only to help clarify.
To the best of her recollection,
she said it happened on August 21, 2012.
Indira Starr says she was
in my apartment August 21, 2012?
Yes.
Sleeping with your husband.
And she said that I found her hiding in my bathroom
and that I told her Peter and I had an open marriage?
Yes.
Well, Peter and I were separated then,
so that's impossible.
Another lie.
At a certain point, the story just crumbles, Mandy.
Indira Starr says she slept with Peter on September 30
at the St. Martin Hotel and afterward,
she heard him call you to discuss picking up the kids.
Is that not true?
What time was that exactly?
So Eli can double check her story?
No.
So, I can refresh my memory.
You really are a lawyer.
Yes, and I am late for court.
She said she heard the call at 11:30 p.m. Approximately.
No. To the best of my memory,
Peter and I didn't talk that night.
Well, thank you for your time, Mrs. Florrick.
It's much appreciated.
You're welcome.
Hope you kill the story.
I don't like being lied about.
No one does.
I could kiss you.
Well, that would give them something to write about.
Hey, you got a pen?
Yeah, Eli, I have a pen.
She claims Peter made a call
at 11:30, immediately after sex.
At the St. Martin Hotel?
Mm-hmm. 15th floor.
Indira Starr was in room 803
and then she went up to Peter's.
You might check.
I think I was in the adjoining room that night.
The 15th... with the door open.
This is Tre Lawson.
Tre was a 19-year-old college freshman, living his dream:
attending Chicago Polytech
on a water polo scholarship.
Until one day, he was hazed to death by...
This man. His teammate, Wayne Crockett.
He is the one who taunted Tre,
bullied him and eventually drowned him.
Wayne Crockett plead guilty to the drowning.
He is serving eight years in prison.
And yet, Ms. Lockhart isn't satisfied.
She is suing...
The university
where this heinous crime took place--
Chicago Polytech.
They are the ones who let the bullying
at this yearly water polo party get out of hand.
And as much as my learned colleague Mr. Andrews
would like to make this case about Mr. Crockett,
it is actually about the university...
turning a blind eye to a vicious student ritual
that cost Mr. And Mrs. Lawson their son.
And what is this, Coach Shank?
The Dunk.
And "The Dunk" is a yearly party the water polo team
has the night before its first match?
Yeah, um, but it's not approved by the school or me.
But, you've been to one before?
Uh, yeah, a few years ago,
but when I saw what was happening, I left.
So, could you describe what is happening here?
It's the first year players, they're...
being held under by the veteran players.
I see.
For as long as they can hold their breath?
Yeah, but again, the school doesn't approve.
He's drowning!
Get him out, get him out of the pool!
In fact, didn't you tell the team
not to do the Dunk this year?
Yes, I did; I thought it was wrong.
But the team did it anyway and they took it off campus.
Yeah, at one of the houses of one of the team members.
So, how could anyone possibly conclude
this was sanctioned by the university?
They knew about it.
It's been an institution at this school for 50 years.
And did the university have a "wink-wink" attitude towards...
Objection, Your Honor.
I will sustain that.
Now, Coach Shank stated that he told the team
not to have the Dunk this year, is that true?
Yeah, but they say that every year.
And you received a text
from Coach Shank the night of the Dunk?
Yes, I did.
Could you read the text?
"Don't get too drunk at the Dunk.
Have match tomorrow."
So, Coach Shank knew about the Dunk going forward?
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, Mr. Sultan.
He offered 500,000.
I told him we're not budging from six million, right?
Yes, this has been hard, hearing him say we're greedy.
The more they call you names,
the more you know you're winning.
Oh, would you excuse me a second?
You almost done?
Yup, in another ten minutes,
we'll no longer occupy the 27th floor.
How'd it look?
Sad.
We'll get it back, Will.
I know.
You retreat to advance.
It just feels like we've been
retreating for four years now.
We're still standing.
Every other firm that started out when we did, they're gone.
I know. But, if you ever want to be motivated,
just come on down to the 27th.
It's a kick in the ass.
Thank you so much for having me.
I imagine you'll forgive a mother
for singing the praises of her son.
He's handsome.
Now, I know that might not be the best reason
to vote for a governor,
but there will always be some women who will come forward
saying my son flirted with them or-or-or touched them...
...but I want you to know Peter has always struggled
with women coming after him.
Even in grade school.
Hey, Eli.
You know, just checking in.
Having a good time here at the Alliance for Retired Americans.
With, uh, your girl Jackie
and would you like to know what she just said?
Well, I told Peter you just have to beat them off with a stick.
Stop her!
How would you suggest I do that?
Use a 2x4 if you have to.
And Peter is an absolute gentleman,
women think he's being nice and, uh,
try to take advantage of him-- yes?
Eli would like to talk to you.
I'm supposed to tackle you if you say no.
Hello, Eli.
Jackie, I need you to excuse yourself from the speech
and let Mr. Moody drive you over here.
I'm in the middle of my remarks.
Jackie!
You're gonna apologize to the room
and tell them that your stroke has left you weak
and then you're gonna get...
Just a few more questions, Mr. Sultan.
You were the best friend of the killer, Wayne Crockett?
Well, I don't know about "best"
But you were friends?
He texted you?
Yes.
And could you read this text he wrote you there?
It's right there, that one.
"Is Mary bringing the brews?"
This was referring to the party, the Dunk?
Yeah.
And who's Mary?
Mary?
It's no one.
Mary is no one.
Uh, well, uh, here's an easier question:
Who brought the brews that night?
Tre.
Ah, Tre Lawson, the victim.
So, was Mr. Crockett referring to Tre as a "Mary"?
Your Honor, objection.
I'm not quite sure what Mr. Andrews finds relevant here.
Yes, I'm intrigued,
Mr. Andrews, but confused.
"Mary" is a derogatory term for someone who's gay, Your Honor.
Objection!
Objection!
Okay, okay, okay, thank you.
Mr. Andrews?
We would agree the plaintiff
has proved the university was aware of the Dunk,
but it is my contention
that the university could not have controlled the killer
because this was a hate crime.
Your Honor, it has no bearing...
No, that is completely irrelevant...
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Mr. Andrews, are you saying
the university isn't liable if Mr. Crockett killed Tre
because he was gay?
Yes. If the murder was not an inevitable consequence of the Dunk...
If-if it was not inevitable, then the university
could not have foreseen the murder.
The killer was never charged with a hate crime.
Yes, but that should not impede Mr. Andrews' theory of the case.
You say the university is liable
because it knew about the hazing and didn't stop it.
He's saying the murder went beyond the hazing
because it was a hate crime,
And, therefore, the university isn't liable.
Well, I'll let both theories contend
and let the jury decide.
So, come back tomorrow,
ready to argue whether this is a hate crime or not.
Our son isn't gay.
Good. Anything you can do to help us.
It's a lie
and he's gonna keep on lying as long as we hold out.
No, sir, he is lying to make you settle.
You told us this was going to be an easy...
What I told you, sir, is that the defense will try anything
in its power to shake your confidence in this case.
Can you promise me you can win this still?
No.
I can promise you that we will work even harder now
because I am angry...
and this should make you angry, too.
Okay.
Okay, if he's not gay, let's prove it.
Get Kalinda on it.
I'll review the case law on hate crimes,
then we'll talk again in two hours.
It's not about comfort; we're the named partners.
Yes, and I'm the creditors' trustee.
I can veto your decisions.
Not on this. Not on office space.
I'm not saying I can on office space.
I am saying I have more clout
and I'm willing to take a smaller office.
Which is your choice.
And what is the topic under discussion?
He wants to put a wall in here; right there.
And you and I will share the space.
We lost the 27th floor.
We have to double up,
and some litigators are without offices.
That will undercut morale,
so it's incumbent upon leadership to sacrifice.
True.
But we're not gonna do it.
We're bringing this firm back,
and we're doing it in the offices we have now.
And unless you want to go to the bankruptcy judge on this,
Mr. Hayden, I suggest you back off!
At some point, you'll realize
I'm trying to save you from yourself.
What got into you?
Wheaties.
Mr. Gold, I was only trying to help you.
Don't.
I am trying to kill an article
about Peter sleeping with a campaign worker,
and every time you talk about women chasing him,
you make that the story.
Don't bark at me, Mr. Gold.
Oh, Jackie, that wasn't barking.
This is barking!
When you've calmed down,
we can discuss my schedule.
Your schedule's changed, Jackie.
You're in Double-A ball now.
I have no idea what that means.
That means that, until you behave,
you'll be speaking at the Regional Senior Center
of Greater Morton Grove.
I've never heard of that.
Exactly.
Miss Hayward.
Mr. Gold. You seem busy.
Yes, we're preparing for a straw poll this weekend.
It means everything and nothing.
Why everything?
Well, the straw poll votes don't actually count for anything,
but if we don't get them, the press will say we're...
You know what? It doesn't matter.
Anyway, what can I do for you?
Hey! Out.
I'm hearing rumors
that trouble me, as a donor.
Well, if they trouble you, they trouble me.
What are they?
That there's another shoe about to drop.
You understand, Eli, I agreed to contribute--
that was dependent on Peter keeping his pants zipped.
Where are you hearing this?
The Women's Leadership Forum.
I was encouraging other donors to give,
and there was some, uh...
reluctance.
Well, Peter has done nothing untoward.
But his political enemies will still lie about him.
I have to go.
Have I assuaged your concerns?
I'm not sure.
Cary, thank you for stepping in.
Very good job on the copyright suit.
Uh, thank you, sir.
No court time, and they settled for $80,000.
Well, if the firm can avoid court, we win.
I feel you've been without an office for much too long, Cary.
You've been here...
Uh, two months.
And everyone speaks highly of you.
So I'd like to move you into an office by the end of the day.
Thank you.
And I want you to come to me when you need to.
When I...?
If there's anything you think can be...
improved... please feel free to contact me.
You mean... like... anything?
Like, the lunchroom or...
people, cases, management decisions...
anything.
I'd hate to limit your scope.
Beth Alexander, and I...
what was the second question?
Your address.
Oh. Sorry.
I'm nervous.
On campus. Van de Beek dorms.
Thank you, Beth.
And you were a classmate and friend - of the victim Tre? - Yeah.
In fact, you were more than that, weren't you?
What do you mean?
You dated.
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance-- one can be gay and still date women.
Then let the defense make
that argument in closing, Your Honor.
This is not the time...
Excuse me...
Hold on, now, both of you!
Sit down, Ms. Lockhart.
Mr. Andrews is correct.
You are not the questioning attorney.
Mrs. Florrick, do you have the same argument
against Mr. Andrews' objection?
Yes, Your Honor.
Then, Mr. Andrews, I overrule your objection.
Let's not argue our case through objections. Please.
Made me break my paperweight.
Mrs. Florrick, you may continue.
Thank you.
Now, Beth, um, I hate to be blunt...
but did you have sex with Tre?
Yeah.
On many occasions?
Yeah, on many.
And to your knowledge, did he ever sleep with men?
No! Tre was from a religious family. He never...
Sorry, Mr. And Mrs. Lawson.
He never slept with men.
Good.
Thank you, Beth. No further questions.
Did you hear the rumor on campus that Tre was gay?
Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.
Ms. Lockhart, again?
Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.
No, Ms. Florrick.
And by extension, Ms. Lockhart.
The question is whether she heard the rumor.
That's all.
She can answer yes or no.
Did I hear the rumor he was gay?
Yeah.
Because he had a lisp?
Well, I don't know why.
It was probably just the way he was.
You mean... effeminate?
Yeah, I guess.
So, anyone not knowing
you were dating Tre might think he was gay.
Objection!
That is irrelevant...
That is exactly my point, Your Honor.
Defense is just pushing...
But that's my point, Your Honor.
Hate crime is not about whether the victim as gay or not,
it is whether the killer thought he was gay.
Your Honor, this lawsuit has gone far afield.
Yes, Ms. Lockhart.
But the point is well-taken.
The reality of the victim's sexual orientation is immaterial.
I might seem gay to someone,
until they found out I had a wife.
So, unless you have evidence
as to the mental state of the killer, I will allow.
You get to Kalinda, ask her to talk to the killer in prison.
He has reason to help us.
Got it.
I need your help.
Oh, and why should today be any different?
This is the new Eli.
The thankful Eli.
So thank you.
Now I need something else.
Mrs. Florrick.
A quick matter?
I know you're having drinks with Maddie tonight.
You do?
I make it my business to know.
That is a scary thought.
She's heard the rumors about Peter
and she needs to know it's a lie.
So tell her.
No, she needs to hear it from his wife.
She knows I lie for a living.
If you tell her, she'll believe you.
This is a friendly drink, Eli.
I'm not going to turn this into a political thing.
Then don't. Tell her as a friend.
Okay, here's what I'm gonna do:
if she brings it up, I will confirm that it is a lie,
but I'm not going to bring it up out of the blue.
Alicia, please.
She will not bring it up.
Take what you can get, Eli.
What do you think of Cary Agos?
What do I think? I think he's great.
You like him?
Yes. Very much.
I'm the one who suggested the firm hire him.
Good. That's all.
Is there anyone else you'd like to talk about, Mr. Hayden?
No, just Cary.
Here we go, Cary.
Your new office.
My office-- this is Alicia's office.
It was Alicia's office.
Now it's both of yours.
Hello, Alicia.
Hello.
Hi, Cary.
Alicia.
So, this should work out fine.
Thank you for understanding.
Welcome.
I-I didn't ask for this.
I know. Really. Welcome, Eli.
Cary.
I'm... losing my mind.
It probably isn't for me.
Alicia Florrick.
Oh, yes, Kalinda.
We need to get to the killer, wayne Crockett,
find out whether he knew the victim was gay.
He's at Tamms.
Cary Agos.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, good.
When can you meet?
We're not going at him too late.
No, we'll make him see he's bitten off more than he can chew.
He doesn't want a hate crime charge
any more than we do.
Look, I'm gonna try...
What?
I was just saying I had to get a key.
Oh. Thanks.
Where are you, Kalinda? What case?
Nothing, it's just something old.
Look, I-I can't speak now.
I'll speak to you later. Bye.
Would you like to see the room?
Yes, please.
Look, were you here on September 30?
I was.
It looks like I checked them in.
Oh, good. Great.
Oh, this woman-- do you recognize her?
No. Who is it?
Indira Starr.
She said she spent the night in the 15th floor suite.
Are you sure you don't recognize her?
I am sure, but...
I don't check in everyone.
Shall we?
Mr. Gold was staying in the room next to Mr. Florrick,
but the door between them was open,
and I just wanted to see if he had
an unobstructed view of the bedroom.
Uh, actually...
the connecting door wasn't open.
It wasn't?
What do you mean?
I mean our staff has to open the door connecting the rooms,
and there was no request.
Can't the occupants open it on their own?
No, I'm sorry.
I've disappointed you.
No, um, it's just not what I expected.
Still want to see the room?
Yeah, sure.
What did you just do?
Well, the 15th floor is the concierge floor.
The guests are given a keycard to access it.
And someone on a lower floor isn't given such a card?
Concierge card? No.
They have to pay for it.
Why?
Well, the campaign worker, Indira Starr,
who was on the eighth floor,
she said she went up to the 15th floor.
Is that possible?
If she was given a concierge key,
yes.
I seem to have pleased you now.
You sure have, Ms. Ledger.
Pedro Almodvar.
Pedro... Manovedar.
Pedro Am... Am...
You're drunk.
No, I don't...
I've never said that name before.
Did we order these?
No.
They just bring them.
They give rich people free things.
They just give...
Yes.
They do.
Um, apartment rooms, food, free computers...
Apartment rooms?
Oh, wait, no. Hotel rooms, I meant.
Free hotel rooms, cars, even.
It's really very wrong.
Poor people have to pay for everything,
and I am given stuff I could buy a hundred of.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I won't make it home.
Well, my driver can take you.
Why do you want to be my friend?
What?
Why do you want this, why are we here?
I don't know, do you not want to be here?
I just... I'm...
I'm not very interesting.
Oh, my God.
I'm...
What?
What?
You were gonna say something. What?
No, no. I, um... I don't know.
I'm... I'm just an idiot.
Oh, no, now you just have to say it.
Thank you for giving, um, to Peter's campaign.
You're welcome.
Was that it?
I was questioned by a reporter
about Peter having an affair with a campaign worker.
And there were lots of questions about me, too.
Things like... how I supposedly
approved of the affair.
So I just...
I wanted you to know what I'm going through.
I'm sorry.
That must be hard.
It is.
Is there anything I can do?
No, no, no. No. No.
I think, um, we've convinced the magazine
that the story's false.
Good.
Did Eli tell you to say that?
Did... what do you mean?
Well, I expressed my concerns to him.
Did he ask you to speak to me?
Yes.
But I wanted to tell you anyway.
I-I did.
Okay.
Guard says you're with the Lawsons.
They're the reason I'm in here.
Why am I gonna help them?
So you don't spend another 20 years in prison on a hate crime.
Maybe they haven't told you.
I've already been convicted.
They can't charge me again.
No. Maybe they haven't told you.
Hate crime is a federal charge.
They can charge you again.
Look, the school is saying that you killed Tre
because he was gay.
Is that true?
No. Tre wasn't gay.
Good. And you'll swear to that in court?
No, I'm not getting on a witness stand.
Why not?
My lawyers don't want me to.
There's more that can go wrong than right.
Then help us.
Who can we speak to?
Chad Minson.
I'm a friend of Wayne Crockett's.
And what happened on the night
of August 26, 2011, Chad?
Wayne and I were in my room, playing Call of Duty.
We left about 3:00 in the morning to go to a diner.
And did you have occasion to see Tre Lawson at that time?
Yes.
He was coming out of Beth Alexander's room.
They were kissing.
And both you and Mr. Crockett saw this?
Objection as to what Mr. Crockett saw.
Uh, Mr. Minson, how do you know what Mr. Crockett saw?
'Cause we laughed about it.
Beth was hot, and Tre had no game, so...
we didn't know how he pulled that.
Overruled.
Mr. Minson...
what is your sexual preference?
I'm gay.
And does Mr. Crockett know that?
Objection as to what Mr. Crockett knows.
I'll allow it.
Yes.
When I came out in tenth grade,
he was one of the first people I told.
And does Mr. Crockett... hate you?
No.
So does the accusation
that Wayne killed Tre because he was gay
seem odd to you?
Objection!
Sustained.
No further questions.
I think that puts this hate crime insanity to rest.
No need to object. I'll withdraw.
Thank you for inviting me to
the Regional Senior Center of Greater Morton Grove.
Your work here is...
...extraordinary.
And I know that my son, in his many years at...
...in his years at
the State's Attorney's Office
has thought often of the
good people of Greater Morton Grove, especially...
...especially...
Uh, especially the seniors.
And we're going to need everybody's help this weekend
to make this straw poll a success.
It's-it's not just the...
It's not just...
It's...
it's not just the most dedicated voters
who-who matter at a...
at a straw poll.
What is she doing?
It's... it's a...
She did that throughout the whole thing?
Yeah.
Odd, huh?
This is because I cut her schedule.
She's getting back at me.
I need to talk to that stupid...
That was a terrific crowd.
Oh. There's Mom.
What's she doing? Is that the luncheon?
No, that's something from today.
I've lost my place.
Yeah. How's she doing?
The straw poll...
Well, um...
struggling.
Well, she needs to get her sea legs back.
By the way, she said you cut her speaking schedule.
Why don't I head out?
Did you? Did you, uh...
cut her schedule down?
Yes.
Jackie has...
tanked a few speeches.
Really? I thought she seemed good.
Peter, we discussed this at the beginning.
I am the strategist.
I have to be given leeway to decide strategy.
Yes, and I'm the candidate.
And my mother's had a stroke,
and she wants to be involved.
Involve her.
I'll see what I can do.
Mr. Minson.
You testified that Mr. Crockett had no problem with gay people.
Do you know if he had any gay friends besides you?
I don't know. I never met any.
Could it be he didn't really view you as a gay friend,
he viewed you as a childhood friend?
I guess.
You said that, uh, Tre had "No game" when it came to women.
What did you mean by that?
He... he wasn't exactly a man's man.
Meaning he was effeminate.
You could say that.
Did Wayne Crockett say that?
Objection. Hearsay.
I'll rephrase.
Did you ever see Wayne mock Tre for being girlish?
Yes, but Wayne was just busting balls, you know?
Did Wayne make fun of other men for being girlish?
Your Honor, objection.
One at a time.
This has become absurd.
What happened to liability?
Liability is dependent on whether it's a hate crime or not.
But you keep changing the nature of the hate.
First it was a hate crime against a gay man,
and now it's a hate crime against men who are...
I shouldn't put words in your mouth, Mr. Andrews.
How would you put it?
Swishy.
So now it's a hate crime against "swishy" people,
who are not gay.
I'm alluding to effeminate mannerisms
which the jury is entitled to conclude are a proxy for homosexuality.
Your Honor, a mannerism is not a protected class.
指的是那些一旦被当作歧视和侵犯的理由即属违法的人的特征 如种族 年龄
There are effeminate heterosexuals,
and effeminate homosexuals,
which is why the essence of gayness is
an actual sexual act.
So there's no such thing as an abstinent gay man?
Or a gay man who marries a woman?
If an effeminate man marries a woman
and doesn't sleep with men,
then yes, that man is not gay.
And if someone kills an abstinent gay man,
you're saying that's not a hate crime?
We're saying that you can't commit a hate crime
against a mannerism.
But you can if that mannerism is a proxy
for a protected class.
Okay. Very provocative, Mr. Andrews.
But as a matter of law,
I don't know if that's true.
As my wife would say,
"The law can't address everything."
Yes, but when the law can't,
the jury must.
Yes. True.
My wife would agree with that, too.
I'm willing to say it's a question of fact,
and the province of the jury.
I'll allow.
What?
I said, I'll allow.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Is that a picture of your wife, there?
No.
Sorry. Thank you.
So. "Swishiness."
No.
But Jackie won't listen to me.
I'm not talking to her about campaign events.
Alicia...
They're not gonna pursue this.
If I have a record,
I'm never gonna be able to get a nursing job.
Prostitution is a class four felony.
Because you have no priors...
Look, I'm just asking you
to help me keep her on the reservation.
I have no leverage over her; you do.
When did all these favors start multiplying?
Oh, right. How'd it go with Maddie?
Okay. I have to work.
You want to keep Jackie in line, give her something.
What do you mean?
Something that makes her feel valued. Important. Useful.
But she is none of those things.
A point you made clear to her.
Now... un-make it.
Yeah, who's this?
Alicia Florrick's desk.
We'll get you probation.
What?
Okay.
You keep your nose clean.
No, no, Kalinda's on it.
That's great!
You wait a few years, you come back...
Just make sure you get it on tape.
...we'll get the conviction expunged.
Are you sure?
And get the file over to me as soon as you can.
It'll be like the arrest never happened.
No, he should be cooperative.
Yes, of course, not a problem.
He doesn't want a...
What?
Do you need me to talk louder?
No, this should pick it up.
Um, thanks, this really helps with my notes.
Oh, no problem. I have nothing to hide.
You said you slept with Peter Florrick
at his suite at the St. Martin Hotel
on September the 30th.
Yes.
And how did you guys meet?
Well, there was a rally
at the Springfield Fairgrounds that day,
I volunteered to register voters.
Peter and I just kind of... hit it off.
What did you talk about?
Oh, stuff.
I said I was hoping to go to law school.
He gave me his room number,
told me to swing by after 10:00 to discuss career options.
And this was his room on the 15th floor?
Yes.
And you're on?
Oh, the eighth floor. All the workers were.
Okay. So you went up to his suite at what time?
Around 11, I guess.
And did you have a key to his room?
No.
The plan was just to knock on his door,
and he would let me in.
Okay, good.
Oh, uh, was anybody else with you
in the elevator when you went up?
No, I made sure I was alone.
I didn't want anyone else to see me.
Of course.
Uh, how did you get the concierge key?
How did I...? What do you mean?
The concierge key-- how-how did you get it?
I don't know what that is.
You pushed for the 15th floor, right?
When you went into the elevator, you didn't do anything else.
Right.
See, the problem is,
Mr. Florrick was staying on the concierge floor,
and you can't gain access to that floor
unless you have a special card key,
or unless you went up with someone in the elevator who did.
But I was there.
No, you weren't. You couldn't have been.
Well, wait, maybe there was someone else on the elevator,
going to the 15th floor.
Indira, you're lying.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Okay, you know what?
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
I think it's fairly clear
that Ms. Starr has fabricated this story.
Or she simply forgot about the concierge key.
Or she's really an alien impersonating Miss Starr.
Either way, I think you're a little
too close to this story, Mandy.
So are you.
The tape's not conclusive either way.
Ms.Sharma, what did you observe
about Ms.Starr's demeanor?
She was nervous.
Covering for an obvious gap in the narrative.
So in your opinion?
She was lying.
I don't have any doubt about it.
I do.
There are other indicia of reliability here.
Merely because an investigator with an agenda
catches a young girl up in an inconsistency...
Richard, can I have a word?
Look, I played ball.
I made the Florricks available.
Peter sat down with Mandy twice.
We appreciate that.
Then you should appreciate that they denied the affair.
At the end of the day, all you have is
some young woman's uncorroborated allegations
which we have gutted.
Here's where you tell me
you have a lawsuit waiting in the wings.
Oh, I wouldn't insult you, Richard.
This isn't your first time at the rodeo.
And it's not mine.
What this comes down to is facts.
And you don't have them.
So you're serving time for drowning Tre Lawson?
Yes.
Your friend says you didn't like him.
Yes, it's true, I didn't like Tre.
Why not?
He was cheap.
He'd make snide comments about people's clothing.
Whine about two-a-day practices.
Anything else?
He was arrogant.
Treated me like I wasn't black enough.
What does that mean?
I come from the suburbs.
He's from the South Side of Chicago.
He'd call me an Oreo. Say I'm not authentic.
Did any of your hostility towards him stem from
behavior you thought was effeminate?
No.
My only problem with Tre was that
he was a jerk.
Thank you.
"Oreo"
Used like that, it's mighty offensive, isn't it?
Yeah.
Which fraternity did you belong to?
Omega Delta Omega.
The black fraternity, right?
Yes.
Would you say the kids in your fraternity
are light-skinned like you or dark-skinned like Tre?
Your honor, objection.
What hate crime is the defense selling today?
Black-on-black.
Wow, they're just relentless.
He has a theory of the case
and he's looking for the facts to satisfy it.
Unfortunately, the judge is letting him run with it.
So black-on-black hate crime? Hmm.
And you think there's truth to it?
They were in rival fraternities,
and there were previous fights.
But that's good.
Why? What do you mean?
It's good that there were fights.
You're losing me.
This isn't about a hate crime.
This is about liability.
Put the coach back on the stand.
I'll take him.
Coach Shank, in its 50-year existence,
the water polo team never had members of
both Omega Delta Omega and Pi Gamma Phi on its roster
at the same time. Why is that?
We've only had a handful of black athletes
in the program's history.
So you weren't aware of animosity
between these two fraternities?
I was not.
This is a 2008 report
by CPT's J.A. citing Pi mmmma Phi and Omega Delta Omega for their role in
a bowling alley brawl.
Is that you on the distribution list?
Yeah. But I don't remember receiving it.
Were you aware that Wayne Crockett was a member of Omega Delta Omega?
Yes.
Were you aware that
Tre Lawson pledged Pi Gamma Phi a week before his death?
No.
This picture
was posted on
Tre Lawson's Facebook memorial page.
It's a photo of a recent team practice, right?
Yeah.
The person just to your left is Tre Lawson.
Could you tell the jury
what the insignia on his shirt says?
Pi Gamma Phi.
Your Honor, I'm not sure what Ms. Lockhart's point is.
Mr. Andrews convinced the court to let him present
his black-on-black hate crime theory to the jury.
So if Coach Shank knew
that the victim and perpetrator belonged
to rival organizations...
Wait a minute.
You can't prove Mr. Crockett drowned Mr. Lawson
because he was black.
Actually, Mr. Andrews,
you already did.
All Ms. Lockhart proved
was that the university knew about the animus.
Step back.
How much?
$6 million. Our original ask.
You seem pretty happy with yourself.
I like the law.
We're gonna get our firm back.
Then we're gonna go after Louis Canning's firm,
then we're gonna open up a branch in New York
and D.C.
It feels pretty good, doesn't it?
What's that, winning?
No. Nothing to lose.
Welcome to the lifeboat.
Okay, you hand them the T-shirts,
you give them the tickets,
you walk them to the ballot. Understand?
Do not take anyone for granted.
Eli, it's Mandy.
You walk them all the way.
Okay, spread out.
Two months I worked on that story, Eli.
You managed to kill it with one conversation. Nice work.
Oh, Mandy, I know you think I must relish this moment,
but it gives me no pleasure wasting my time
to prove you wasted yours.
Here, have a sausage.
She was a naive 25-year-old,
who was overcome by the occasion.
I still stand by my story.
Mm-hmm. Really? I gotta go.
Hello, Alicia.
Jackie.
The two of us,
I know we haven't always seen eye to eye,
but I just want you to know how much...
I'm sorry I doubted you, Alicia.
Standing by Peter the way you're doing.
He needs you now. And I'm just...
I'm just so glad you're there for him.
Thank you... Jackie.
Jackie?
What?
Are you okay?
Hello?
Mr. Eli Gold?
Who's this?
Jimmy V. I run a political blog.
Oh, well, let me get you our press secretary.
No, that's all right.
I'm about to publish a story saying
a national magazine is sitting on a piece
accusing Peter Florrick of sleeping with a campaign worker.
I'd like to get a quote from the campaign.
Did I lose you?
No.
Where are you getting this?
An anonymous tip.
I see.
Well, it's a lie and it's defamatory.
And if I were you, Jimmy V.,
I would take a breath before you post anything actionable.
Is that your quote?
What's the blog?
PoorAnarchy.com. All one word.
Never heard of it.
