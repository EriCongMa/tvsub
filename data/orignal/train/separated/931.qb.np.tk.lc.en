i was thinking about this great guy from my past .
an evening of drinking led to a confession .
tom .
tom scavo ?
love of my life .
i have to talk to you about something really important .
did anyone order a shrimp cocktail
with a puny engagement ring on the side ?
keith &apos;s plan to propose was thwarted .
i really do love your son .
yeah , i see you with someone ... more your own age .
what are you doing ?
memorizing your face .
gaby said good @-@ bye to her biological daughter grace .
a halfway house for convicts on our street ?
i now own seven houses on wisteria lane .
and paul needed one more house ...
i can offer you well above market value .
how much above market value ?
we have to stick together .
to achieve his goal .
we know what they look like .
we know how they dress ...
and we know how they behave .
yes , we can all recognize the wrong kind of people .
and when we see them coming ,
we do what we have to to protect ourselves .
lynette !
how are you this fine day ?
who are these people ?
old friends .
ex @-@ con friends ?
uh ... aren &apos;t you jumping the gun ?
until the homeowners association votes ,
you don &apos;t have approval for your project .
these men have volunteered to get my halfway house ready .
most of them live in a dreadful facility on skid row .
i told them that if they participated in the remodel ,
i could get them transferred here .
you &apos;re wasting their time ,
because this place is never going to open .
oh , i think it will .
and won &apos;t it be nice for these men to live on a street
where children play in their front yards
and people don &apos;t lock their doors at night ?
why is paul so sure the house will open ?
he doesn &apos;t have the votes .
he &apos;s got something up his sleeve .
what it is i don &apos;t know .
are we positive no one &apos;s planning on selling him their home ?
we can &apos;t take anyone for granted .
we need to talk to everyone on the street .
good idea . we &apos;ll shore up support .
and if we sense anyone starting to waver ...
how could they ?
everyone knows what &apos;s at stake here .
i pray they do .
i love this neighborhood , and i don &apos;t want it to change .
let &apos;s go .
and with that ,
my friends went to work trying to stop paul young .
he knew what they were up to .
but he didn &apos;t care .
he should have .
paul had forgotten what ordinary men and women
will do to protect themselves ...
from the wrong kind of people .

it was just before sunrise on wisteria lane ...
when a cab arrived ...
and a woman departed .
she left the street quietly .
but news of her disappearance would soon spread .
and the sound would be deafening .
but first ...
a young man in love
had plans to make some noise of his own .
bree , i love you , and i want this to be
the last morning you wake up without me next to you .
6 : 00 ! how long have you been kneeling there ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but after you answer this question ,
you &apos;re gonna need to help me up .
bree ...
will you do me the honor ...
may i say something first ?
after that embarrassing night in the restaurant ,
i really appreciate you taking another stab at this , but ...
that &apos;s a long &quot; but . &quot; i &apos;m getting up .
hold on . i &apos;m not saying no ...
exactly .
it &apos;s just so soon to be talking about marriage .
maybe i can use this as a tiny napkin ring .
wait !
i have a proposal for you .
i love you , too ,
keith watson ,
and i also want this to be the last morning i wake up
without you next to me .
so i &apos;m asking you ,
will you do me the honor of ...
moving in with me ?
for the third time , no .
i &apos;m not gonna sell my house to paul young .
i &apos;m sorry . i just had to make sure .
the vote is today .
do you really think that i would let dangerous ex @-@ cons
move in next to my own mother ?
i don &apos;t know .
as a teenager , you were pretty nasty .
but you &apos;re all grown up now and so very nice .
thank you for your support .
excuse me .
lynette scavo ?
yeah ?
brent ferguson , president
of the hydrangea circle homeowners association .
we &apos;ve all heard about your situation .
we &apos;d love to help .
really ?
sure .
last year we had a similar scare on our street .
some old hippie wanted to open up a drug rehab center
on our block .
i remember .
didn &apos;t that old hippie get beat up by a neighbor ?
he made the mistake of mouthing off
to one of my neighbors who &apos;s an ex @-@ green beret .
newspaper made it sound way worse than it was .
well , nice to meet you .
you say the word ,
and i will have the homeowners association
of ten different streets here to back you folks up .
whoever &apos;s trying to open up this halfway house ,
we could really scare the hell out of them .
well , i appreciate your offer ,
but i think we &apos;d prefer to handle our situation
in a more ...
civilized manner .
okay . well ,
you change your mind ,
you know where to find me .
&quot; hydrangea circle , &quot; got it .
so we &apos;re at dinner ,
and renee is going on and on about this guy
she once had a fling with and she still has feelings for .
and she gets so drunk that
she tells me it was tom scavo .
what am i supposed to do with that ?
you look so hot right now .
mike , focus .
i know you &apos;ve been in alaska for a month .
a month , 19 days , and 7 hours .
yesterday i put boobs on a snowman .
i need to come home .
i miss you , too .
so am i making too much out of this ?
i mean , it happened 20 years ago ,
and tom &apos;s a good guy , right ?
yeah , he is , but ...
even good guys make mistakes
if the circumstances are right .
interesting point . wish you hadn &apos;t made it
while you were 2,000 miles away and clearly horny .
susan , i am in the middle of nowhere .
the only female i &apos;ve seen has antlers .
so should i tell lynette ?
well , not just yet .
maybe just keep an eye on the situation .
thanks for the advice .
just so you know , when you come home ,
i &apos;m gonna make you forget all about that snowman .
her name is carol .
okay , you really need to come home .
mommy ?
why are you crying ?
oh ... just ...
having a sad day .
you &apos;ve been having a lot of sad days .
is it because grace left ?
why would you say that ?
that was when you started being sad--
the day she went away .
no , it &apos;s just , you know ...
i got really close to that whole family , and ...
i knew i was gonna miss carmen and hector .
and grace ?
why are you wearing my necklace ?
i &apos;m playing dress @-@ up .
not with real diamonds . hand it over !
fine . here .
take it .
and i don &apos;t want you playing in my room anymore .
you understand ?
i liked you better when you were crying .
mitzi !
it &apos;s lynette scavo !
if you &apos;re in there ,
please open up !
hey , lee . hey .
you wouldn &apos;t happen to know where mitzi kinsky is , would you ?
no . why would i ?
i thought maybe you and paul convinced her to sell her house
and then stashed her away someplace for safekeeping .
lynette , i have to say , i &apos;m offended .
i have to say , i couldn &apos;t care less .
you know ...
for the millionth time , i had no idea what he was up to !
you were his real estate agent ! you didn &apos;t think it odd--
him buying all these houses on one street ?
he was paying me commissions . what--what am i supposed to do ?
complain ?
maybe you didn &apos;t know ,
and if paul is voted down at tonight &apos;s meeting , i &apos;m sure
in time people will forget you had anything to do with this--
i-- but , lee , if he finds a way to open that house ,
i don &apos;t think anyone on this street will ever forgive you .
hello ?
look out your window .
oh , it &apos;s you . i &apos;m hanging up now .
look , i understand you &apos;re annoyed with me .
i feel awful .
well , you should .
because of you , everyone on this street hates me now .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m calling .
i put you in an awful position . i &apos;d like to make it up to you .
and how are you gonna do that ?
well , first , you should know that mitzi kinsky
agreed to sell me her house yesterday .
what ?
i suggested she leave the lane for a while .
the taxi picked her up this morning .
oh , my god . so why-- why are you telling me this ?
because i have a little proposition for you .
and given how the neighbors feel about you these days ,
i suggest you listen .
hey , mitzi , it &apos;s lynette .
um , still haven &apos;t heard from you . i need to make sure
we &apos;re all on the same page for tonight &apos;s meeting . call me back .
ay . hey .
i know you &apos;re probably busy . i really need to talk to somebody .
i would love to , but the meeting &apos;s tonight .
i got a bunch of phone calls to make .
can &apos;t you talk to susan or bree ?
no . it &apos;s gotta be you .
why ?
you &apos;re the only woman i know who &apos;s lost a child .
and ever since grace left , i can &apos;t stop crying .
i break down at the mall , at the market .
i &apos;m starting to freak myself out .
i was the same way after i lost the baby .
i finally went to a therapist .
i didn &apos;t know that . yeah .
did it help ?
it did .
in fact , she had me do something you might want to try .
write grace a letter .
a letter ?
you don &apos;t send it .
you just pour out your feelings .
tell grace how happy you are to have found her
and how much you love her .
trust me . after you &apos;ve written it , you &apos;ll feel so much better .
gaby ! where are my keys ?
uh , i have them !
wait . i &apos;ll be right down !
you &apos;re moving in together ?
no one &apos;s more surprised than i am .
so you did propose to her ?
i tried . bree said she &apos;s not ready for that yet .
this was the compromise .
i figure we &apos;ll do this for a while , then in a couple months
we &apos;ll start talking about a wedding .
yeah , i @-@ i guess that could happen .
you &quot; guess &quot; ?
it &apos;s just ...
if bree was in love with you , seems she &apos;d want to ...
lock it down . that &apos;s all .
dad , i get where she &apos;s coming from .
she just divorced a guy .
that &apos;s my point .
she &apos;s ready for some fun , not something serious .
she may be looking at you as a diversion .
no , bree loves me . this is going somewhere .
just make sure .
if bree &apos;s not willing to make some sort of a commitment ,
then maybe ...
dad , you &apos;re starting to piss me off .
i hope i &apos;m wrong . i really do .
and if i am ...
you let me know when to rent the tux for the wedding .
okay .
any sign of mitzi ?
oh , not yet .
god , where could she be ?
if she sold her house to paul ,
she better be on the run .
not that it &apos;ll do any good .
i &apos;ll still hunt her down and kill her .
lynette ? we &apos;ve been here for 20 minutes .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time you started ?
relax , paul . we &apos;re not taking the vote
until everyone &apos;s here .
well , while we &apos;re waiting , may i make an announcement ?
i suppose .
may i have your attention , please ?
i wanted you all to know
that the mayor of fairview will be here friday
to present me with an award for outstanding public service .
what ? what ?
yes , it &apos;s--it &apos;s-- it &apos;s sort of a big deal ,
and i would love it
if all of my friends would attend .
if you &apos;d invite your enemies , you &apos;d get a bigger crowd .
ah , i love your sense of humor , mrs. mccluskey .
how we &apos;ll all miss it after you &apos;re gone .
hold it . now , what kind of public service did you do ?
the halfway house , of course .
oh , shoot . did--did i bury the lead ?
i now have all the votes i need to open it .
how do you have the votes ?
someone sold you their house ?
oh , yes .
we shouldn &apos;t have sold .
we should have just gone under
with the rest of the neighborhood .
which would have been very noble and very stupid .
mitzi sold . she &apos;s not gonna be around
for everybody on this street to pummel ,
which means they would have taken their anger out on you .
didn &apos;t have a choice .
what the hell ?
mitzi , what are you doing here ?
i live here . oh , i guess you would have noticed ,
if i was a hot guy with abs .
but we thought you left .
weirdest thing . get this call ?
this guy says he has a job for me in the city .
puts me up in a nice hotel , and then he never showed .
huh , and i got stuck with the minibar charges .
so , wait . you didn &apos;t sell your house to paul young ?
what ?
please . i &apos;m not gonna screw over my neighbors .
lee ?
what the hell have you done to us ?
no , i &apos;m sorry . lynette is not here .
she &apos;s trying to deal with this whole paul young mess .
yes , i will have her get back to you .
ok @-@ okay .
what is happening to this neighborhood ?
some van just pulled up ,
and these creepy characters are getting out .
that is a school bus , renee . those are children .
well , i don &apos;t like the way they &apos;re looking at me .
can you come over and install a dead bolt on my door ?
sure . i will be right over ,
as soon as i find where lynette keeps the toolbox .
great . i have to jump in the shower .
i will leave the key under the mat .
you know , i had to use that key the other night .
yeah ?
yeah . we went out , and renee got hammered ,
so i had to take her in and put her to bed .
well , that was nice of you .
yeah ...
and she told me this fascinating story
about this guy that she had a fling with 20 years ago .
w @-@ why was that fascinating ?
well , apparently the one weekend they spent together
ade quite an impact on her .
w @-@ did she say any ... thing ...
else a @-@ about that guy ?
no , not really .
only that his name was tom scavo .
okay , look ...
this happened before lynette and i were married .
it meant nothing .
well , it meant something to renee .
she &apos;s still in love with you .
she said that ?
she slurred it .
look , this is not something i wanted to know ,
but now that i do , i am in a horrible position .
no , no , no , no , no . you can &apos;t tell lynette !
sh @-@ she would freak out !
i don &apos;t want to tell her , but she &apos;s my best friend ,
and i &apos;m freaking out knowing that you &apos;re at renee &apos;s
fixing her dead bolt while she &apos;s in the shower .
look , this was forever ago ,
and i don &apos;t feel anything for her .
a beautiful woman who still wants you
is living 100 yards away ,
and her breasts are 95 yards away .
why do you want that temptation ?
hey , i didn &apos;t ask her to move here .
well ...
maybe it &apos;s time you ask her to leave .
so the whole right side of the closet is yours ,
and i emptied out the top drawers of the bureau
for your socks and those cute little boxer briefs you wear .
thank you .
and after we &apos;ve gotten you settled ,
i want us to go over and tell the girls .
they &apos;re going to die .
bree van de kamp living in sin .
come here .
what is it ?
we love each other , right ?
why don &apos;t you just go ahead and wear this ?
keith .
no , if--if--if marriage is where we &apos;re headed ,
i just keep thinking , what &apos;s the harm ?
because we &apos;re not there yet .
look , i &apos;m not trying to rush you ,
but i need a bigger commitment
than just the top couple drawers in your bureau .
we talked about this .
i &apos;m not ready to make that kind of promise .
that &apos;s a problem .
because i don &apos;t wanna wake up one day
and find out that i was just some diversion
that , uh , you needed to amuse yourself
while getting through your divorce .
if you really think i feel that way ,
then why are you even here ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m starting to wonder that myself .
do you think us living together is a mistake ?
no . no , i think us is a mistake .
i wish we had been nicer to paul .
i wish we had stood by him when he was on trial .
i think about what he must have gone through in prison ,
and i understand his rage . i do .
but i won &apos;t allow him to destroy this street .
it &apos;s not right .
don &apos;t worry .
we will stop this son of a bitch .
that &apos;s a promise .
hey . m.j. &apos; s spending the night at a friend &apos;s house ,
so i don &apos;t care if this protest goes all night .
i &apos;m here to the bitter end .
how can i help ?
we need more signs painted .
okay .
hey , susan .
look on that paper . we came up with a whole list of slogans .
just so you know , we got plenty of &quot; think about the children , &quot;
and we need a lot more &quot; who let the cons out ? &quot;
so , what exactly are we hoping to accomplish with all this ?
the mayor is in a close race for re @-@ election .
he needs every vote he can get . if we can make
a big enough stink in front of the news cameras ,
maybe we can embarrass him into shutting that place down .
so if this protest works , and the place doesn &apos;t open ,
what happens to all those ex @-@ cons ?
what happens to them ?
i mean , i @-@ if they don &apos;t get to stay here , where will they go ?
they &apos;ll just go back to where they came from ,
or some house in another neighborhood .
but what if that neighborhood doesn &apos;t want them either ?
i mean , if they &apos;ve done their time ,
and they need a second chance , wouldn &apos;t it be better for them
to be in a nice neighborhood ?
in theory , yes , but that &apos;s not the way the world works .
we have to think about our neighborhood , our children .
ourselves ?
don &apos;t be cute . some of these men may have good intentions ,
but some of them could still be really bad guys .
but if we don &apos;t even try to help them ,
are we so sure we &apos;re the good guys ?
richard .
keith told me what happened . i &apos;m so sorry .
thank you .
so , uh , why are you here ?
he also mentioned all that work that needs to be done .
in your backyard .
luckily , i taught him everything he knows .
uh , wait . uh , you don &apos;t need to do that .
it &apos;s not a problem . i &apos;ll have it done by the end of the week .
but if you wanna thank me ,
think you could find me something cold to drink ?
mayor franklin .
what an honor . paul young .
you must be the good samaritan .
i &apos;ve heard so much about .
this is my wife beth .
i &apos;ve never met a celebrity before .
well , now you have .
the media will be arriving shortly ,
as well as some of the mayor &apos;s supporters .
uh , with the election just a few days away ,
we thought this could be a terrific photo op .
no problem .
while you &apos;re waiting , would you like a tour of the facility ?
absolutely .
i must say , i don &apos;t know how you got your neighbors
to agree to a halfway house on their street ,
but they must think a lot of you .
honestly , this is all happening because of what i think of them .
richard ? is that you ?
the lemonade &apos;s not quite ready yet .
richard , would you like a sandwich with that--
who are you ?
this the halfway house ?
uh , no . that &apos;s next door .
so i guess we &apos;re gonna be neighbors .
well , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re in a hurry to get settled in over there , so ...
i &apos;m in no hurry .
what &apos;s going on in here ?
uh , this , um , gentleman just , uh , wandered into my home .
i made a mistake .
won &apos;t happen again .
it better not .
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine , i was just , uh , taken by surprise .
you &apos;re shaking . come on . come on . come on .
no , really ... really , i &apos;m fine , just , um ...
thank you for taking care of that .
what are you doing ?
something i &apos;ve wanted to do for a long time .
you &apos;re gonna have to leave .
okay . maybe i misread some signals .
there have been no signals .
i was dating your son .
okay . if that &apos;s the way you feel ,
then i &apos;ll finish up out back and go .
i want you to leave now .
look , i made an error in judgment . i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
please let me finish the work .
i said now .
i will leave when i &apos;m finished .
okay . yeah , yeah , here we are .
well , here &apos;s trouble .
bunch of geeks with &quot; vote franklin &quot; signs
just showed up .
looks like we &apos;re outnumbered now .
oh , i &apos;m not worried .
who the hell are they ?
the cavalry .
hey , guys . guys !
i &apos;m not too late , am i ?
nope .
you &apos;re just in time .
oh , yeah .
okay ! here &apos;s the plan .
once the mayor begins his speech ,
i &apos;ll give the signal .
that &apos;s when we all begin chanting , okay ? you got it ?
all right ! let &apos;s go !
we need to talk now .
quite a turnout .
look at those news cameras .
uh , do i need a little base ?
hi @-@ def is killing me .
hey , franklin !
where did all these people come from ?
i don &apos;t know .
but it looks like things are about to get very interesting .
no , no , no ! how did she find out ?
you told her the other night !
oh , while we were drinking .
you were drinking . she was listening !
oh , my god .
yeah , this is bad .
what else did you say to her ?
i mean , she thinks that you still have feelings for me .
oh , well , that &apos;s just ... ridiculous .
she &apos;s not gonna say anything to lynette , is she ?
no .
does she want you to tell lynette ?
no , she had a different suggestion .
and i think it &apos;s a good one .
i &apos;m going outside to watch the protest .
stay in your room and look after your sister .
oh ! don &apos;t get into those cookies i made .
those are for after supper , and yes , i counted them .
juanita , what &apos;s wrong ?
what is that ?
the letter you wrote to grace .
okay .
okay .
honey , you really shouldn &apos;t have read this ...
&apos;cause it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
grace is your daughter , isn &apos;t she ?
that &apos;s why you &apos;ve been crying since she left .
you love her more than me .
no . no , no , no !
that is not true .
you are the most important thing in this world to me .
you believe mommy , don &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re not my mommy .
juanita !
come back here !
juanita !
juanita !
juanita !

tom told me about your little , uh , suggestion
that i need to move off the lane .
and i want you to know , that ain &apos;t gonna happen .

&apos;cause i am lynette &apos;s friend , and i &apos;m not gonna stand by
and watch you screw up her marriage .

me ? those are your friends out there , lynette--
the solid citizens of fairview .
tell me again
why you think they &apos;re better than a bunch of ex @-@ cons ?
stop !
stop it ! leave him alone ! leave him alone ! stop !
he &apos;s my neighbor !
stop it !
take him over ! get him over here !
come on !
somebody help !
thank you .
it was just before sunrise on wisteria lane .
you could no longer hear
the screams of frightened bystanders ...
or the angry chanting of protestors ...
or the cries for help from the injured .
there were just the footsteps of a man
who had finally punished those who had betrayed him .
the silence was broken
by something the neighbors would later say ...
sounded like a gunshot .
but paul knew
