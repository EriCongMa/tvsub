the sad lady book club is reading
fifty shades of grey again .
there &apos;s not a dry seat in the house .
if those ladies are that into light torture ,
they should just apply for our jobs .
aww , you two are so adorable .
like romeo and juliet , but without the bright future .
yeah ...
i want him out of the diner .
what are you talking about ?
anyone who works in this diner
is like a fat guy in a smart car .
you can never get out .
it &apos;s true .
i came in here in 1962 for a cup of coffee .
someone asked me to break a dollar , and i never left .
look . living , working , and sleeping with the same guy
is never a good idea .
just talk to hillary clinton .
i guess i can get a dishwasher fired .
when i was rich , i got wolfgang puck fired from wolfgang puck .
get yours , max !
hit it then quit it .
that strategy served me well in my 20s and 30s .
evening , ladies .
also , my 70s .
pick up .
or don &apos;t .
who gives a crap ?
well , someone &apos;s in a bad mood . what &apos;s wrong , oleg ?
did they discontinue making axe body spray ?
don &apos;t even kid .
no . i &apos;m cranky because i &apos;m not having sex right now .
yeah . i thought it was weird seeing both your hands
while you were talking .
sophie &apos;s idea . it &apos;s some old polish ritual .
the bride and groom remain chaste for 30 days before the wedding .
apparently , the &quot; something blue &quot; at the wedding
has got to be my balls .
so , you &apos;re practicing celibacy .
i &apos;m trying , but there are women everywhere .
i feel like a bull in a vagina shop .
hear ye , hear ye !
i &apos;m unveiling a major improvement to the diner !
well , we &apos;ll miss you , han .
nice try , max , but like ryan seacrest ,
主持了 《 美国偶像 》 10多季了
i &apos;ll be here forever .
now , will you all please do what you have yet to do on twitter
and follow me ?
you too , earl .
hell , this better be good .
every step i take could be my last .
and now ...
without further a @-@ douche ...
ready to have your minds blown ?
at this point , i &apos;m ready to have anything blown .
ta @-@ da !
that is the worst gift i ever received
and last year , my son bought me a coffin .
this works our great then , because it &apos;s not for you .
it &apos;s for nash .
oh , well , that &apos;s real nice .
because the shower at max &apos;s place doesn &apos;t work at all .
you better believe it &apos;s nice .
that &apos;s the spritzy 5000 .
dishwasher weekly gave it four out of four dishies .
you know our oven doesn &apos;t work , right ?
hey , boss lady ,
if we work hard , do we get a gift ?
if you work hard , i &apos;ll die childless
with my mouth frozen open in shock .
yeah , i went there !
nash works hard , so only he may handle my beautiful hose !
well , if he &apos;s handling han &apos;s hose ,
he &apos;s never getting fired .
okay . step up here , nash .
i &apos;ll show you what this puppy can do .
so far the puppy can &apos;t reach the hose .
a little help .
aww , there &apos;s nothing cuter than a hot guy holding a baby .
now just grab that thing and squeeze it till it sprays .
move to call a moratorium on the words &quot; grab , &quot; &quot; squeeze , &quot;
and &quot; sprays &quot; till the wedding .
damn ! that &apos;s hot .
and me without any singles to stuff down his pants .
well , i better go dry off in the men &apos;s room .
don &apos;t be too long in that stall .
i &apos;ve got a date with the land o &apos;lakes butter package lady
on my next break .
pardon me , ladies . i &apos;m all wet .
max ? are you seeing what i &apos;m seeing ?
those ladies looking at him
like he &apos;s a senior special at sizzler &apos;s ?
we might not be able to get nash fired ,
but we can get him hired as a fashion model .
look at their faces .
he could be the future bulge of calvin klein .
now you &apos;re talking about the future ?
why can &apos;t you just accept that we are stuck
with a really crappy present ?
quit trash @-@ talking the spritzy 5000 !
good afternoon . welcome to the high .
i &apos;ll have somebody get you some water .
not me , &apos; cause i &apos;m past that .
you know , here .
i think i just sat another one of those
lesbian blind @-@ dates for our boss .
it &apos;s hard out there for a pimp .
why do you think i got out of pimping ?
that and someone broke a beer bottle over my head .
so , did you get nash a modeling job yet ?
i &apos;m working on it .
it &apos;s not like i can just call tyra banks .
well , that &apos;s what her people said when i called .
ugh , phone therapy ran long .
apparently i have more issues
than i realized about rosie leaving the view .
are my dates here yet ?
please don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s her , her , or her .
it &apos;s her , her , and her .
lose them .
how am i supposed to get rid of them ?
just say what anyone says when they want a lesbian to leave ,
&quot; there &apos;s a subaru outside that &apos;s about to get a ticket . &quot;
if you had you told me , ten years ago ,
i &apos;d be on a dating site called &quot; lez meet up , &quot;
i would &apos;ve told the youth pastor i was married to ,
&quot; you &apos;ve lost your mind . &quot;
oh , i just got some interest
from the del monico modeling agency .
but for the interview , he needs photos .
and not just the pictures of his butt on your phone .
fine , you handle it .
the only thing i know about modeling is
a couple of years ago , i was the face of shingles on webmd .
girls , perfect timing to ask me to do this photo shoot .
the fbi just gave me my camera back last week .
oh , so you get your camera back ,
but i &apos;m still waiting on that kilo of coke
that i spent hours carefully filling my butt with ?
let me just change the settings .
this camera is used to taking pictures from 800 feet away .
and we want those pictures back , oleg !
hey , everybody !
just call me &quot; rush hour traffic &quot;
&apos;cause i sure am horny .
oh , caroline , i do not know how you go years , and years ,
and years , and years , and years , and years
without doing the nasty .
it &apos;s only been years and years .
come on .
and years .
well , i could go for a brisket sandwich .
we &apos;re closed , sophie .
i know . i got one in my purse .
and why are you doing the photo shoot in this skanky dishroom ?
because we &apos;re going with the &quot; hot dishwasher &quot; angle .
the agency said every model needs a hook .
yeah , like how cindy crawford has a beauty mark
and anna nicole smith is dead .
yeah , yeah . my sister is a model in poland and she has a hook .
it &apos;s her left hand , yeah .
it &apos;s is also great for kabobs .
come on , nash !
put a little irish spring in your step .
i &apos;m a little nervous .
the only other time i had my picture taken was at school .
the priest said he needed a shirtless one for the roll call .
where did he go to school ,
our lady of to catch a predator ?
wow . you sure look hot .
careful , sophie .
that &apos;s my brisket .
i &apos;m not talking about daniel day @-@ loser here .
i &apos;m talking about oleg .
you are sweating like an old knockwurst
that has been left out in the sun .
it &apos;s really breathtaking .
okay , nash , stand over here near the hose
and give me hot face , dead eyes .
you know , like me when i mix nyquil and dayquil .
i call it afternoonquil .
okay . now i &apos;m gonna start shooting .
yeah . shoot , baby ! shoot !
what do you think ?
well , he &apos;s stiff , but not in the good way .
ugh , this is painful .
he &apos;s like susan boyle without the star quality .
we need a little of what he had the other day .
you &apos;ll thank me for this later .
yes , nash , yes !
tear your shirt !
yeah , yeah .
oh , yeah , yeah .
stop !
what the hell is happening in here ?
i didn &apos;t give anyone permission to use my diner for a photo shoot .
calm down .
we are trying to get him a modeling job .
he has a job ! he &apos;s my number one worker .
like the doctor said to your mother when you were born ,
tough break .
you two crows don &apos;t let me have anything !
okay , nash , part of the model audish is to see
how you &apos;d be as a performer in commercials , and movies ,
and other things people don &apos;t watch anymore .
now , obviously , right out of the gate ,
you &apos;re not gonna be as good as that duck who says &quot; aflac , &quot;
还喊出了公司名缩写的发音 &quot; 阿弗莱克 &quot;
but you &apos;ve got to be at least as good as ben affleck .
i can help . for a time , i had a rich acting career .
it started with a starring role in annie ,
and ended when i portrayed rosa parks
in an ill @-@ advised high school production
that led to an investigation by the naacp .
ooh , this is a commercial for breakfast cereal !
ah ! every actor &apos;s dream !
hey , nash , read this .
think james dean .
长相与形象走帅气不羁风
but alive and eating cocoa puffs .
&quot; cocoa puffs are a delicious part
of any well @-@ balanced breakfast . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to find a nice way to say--
you suck , bro .
you--you get it .
you know the thrill of eating chocolate
at a traditionally non @-@ chocolatey time of day .
let &apos;s tap into that .
okay . take it from the top .
and this time , go cuckoo .
但cuckoo杜鹃这词也常被拿来形容疯子
go cuckoo for cocoa puffs .
&quot; cocoa puffs are a delicious-- &quot;
stop .
don &apos;t phone this in . it &apos;s not raisin bran .
&quot; pocoa cuffs are a delicious-- &quot;
&quot; pocoa cuffs &quot; ?
pocoa cuffs ?
i just can &apos;t with these rank amateurs , caroline .
max , calm down .
it &apos;s a fake tryout for a cereal commercial ,
not dance moms .
节目中有一名十分毒舌的舞蹈教师
i &apos;m nervous . i &apos;m not an actor .
uh , no , you are not .
give me that .
got it .
cocoa puffs are a delicious part of any well @-@ balanced breakfast !
they &apos;re good for you , which parents love ,
and they taste like candy , which i love !
i can &apos;t help it ! i &apos;m cuckoo for cocoa puffs !
cuckoo !
i &apos;m tearing up , and it &apos;s not just the black mold in here .
max , i think you may have just set the acting bar too high .
i &apos;ve never set a bar too high before .
i &apos;ve set a bar on fire and i &apos;ve left a bar too high .
oh , hey , girls .
oh , do you mind if i hang down here with you for a while ?
oleg is up there ,
he &apos;s trying to seduce me by cleaning the apartment .
and it &apos;s , oh , oh , so dirty .
oh , oh , he &apos;s vacuuming now , which means he &apos;s naked .
oh , me and my polish values .
polish values ?
that &apos;s the name of my favorite dollar store in brooklyn .
oh , he &apos;s deep @-@ cleaning the shag .
oh , my god . somebody ,
do something to make me not want sex .
all right , nash , why don &apos;t you show us your runway walk ?
that was it .
oh , i thought you were going to pick up a pen .
thanks , perfect .
now i &apos;m completely turned off .
watching that potato walk across the room really did the trick .
nash , concentrate .
follow my lead .
bam . pow . bam . pow .
and step and bam , and step and pow ,
and step and bam !
oh , even better !
i mean , after that , they could film the sequel
to frozen on my lady parts .
yeah , me too .
but just &apos; cause i &quot; let it go &quot; down there .
oh , now he &apos;s using the wand attachment .
oh , and he &apos;s getting real deep between the cushions .
oh , my god , just screw it .
i &apos;m never gonna make it to the wedding !
oh , grandma kuchenski , please forgive me
for what i &apos;m about to do .
i--
well , you were no white lily yourself !
he &apos;s bamming and powing up a storm .
when he &apos;s famous , i hope he remembers us .
pfft . i like to think i did some things he will never forget .
how &apos;s that ?
great , you can walk .
if you can read too , i &apos;ll treat myself to a snapple .
let &apos;s get to the copy .
actually , we came prepared .
nash rehearsed the cocoa puffs commercial .
i think you &apos;ll be quite moved .
oh yeah ,
well , we &apos;ll be reading something a little different today .
don &apos;t panic . they do this all the time .
they want to make sure you &apos;re flexible .
yeah . go ahead , nash .
whatever cereal it is , act like it &apos;s delicious .
unless it &apos;s rice krispies . a @-@ boring !
okay , here goes .
&quot; you know you like it .
bend over , bitch . &quot;
uh , are we missing a page ?
cereals have changed since i was a kid .
should i read the part where i notice
the teacher &apos;s not wearing any panties ?
oh , my god . this is porn !
no wonder all those people out there were freaks .
no wonder i recognized so many of them .
don &apos;t act so surprised .
everyone knows cocoa puffs is code for porn .
also , you sent us some pictures taken by someone
very experienced in erotica .
we can &apos;t let him do this .
i have a movie that starts shooting tomorrow
that pays $ 1,000 a day .
can we ?
maybe we can &apos;t .
it &apos;s the lead in sorest rump .
maybe we can .
i think we need a little sidebar , delores .
should i come with you ?
no , we &apos;re good .
i have a couple of questions for the actor .
can you swim , and are you circumcised ?
max , this has gone too far .
i know , i was expecting you to just crash with me
for a couple of days and get your own place .
are we really gonna let nash do porn
just so he doesn &apos;t work at the diner ?
hey , ladies , what &apos;s it gonna be ?
i got other talent to see .
i got a guy named lustin beaver
taking the amtrak in from philly .
max , if you &apos;re really keen on me being a porn actor ,
i &apos;ll do it .
she says , tomorrow , they start filming
the grand booty fest hotel .
and , they &apos;ll pay me more for my accent .
also , what does &quot; gay for pay &quot; mean ?
ugh , i guess it means we got to go .
look at him , max .
a cute guy , eaten up and spat out by show business
like so many baldwin brothers before him .
现在连家族中第三代也开始进军演艺圈
nash doesn &apos;t care about modeling .
he &apos;s 21 . he doesn &apos;t care about anything .
his biggest concern is playing with the xbox .
mine and , also , the popular video game system .
he cares about you .
he was willing to do &quot; gay for pay . &quot;
did i hear nash is going &quot; gay for pay &quot; ?
&apos;cause i &apos;ve got $ 4 burning a hole in my pocket .
oh , a customer .
hi , welcome to the high . here for dessert ?
oh , thanks but i haven &apos;t had cake since my sweet 16,
and even then , i made myself throw it up .
i &apos;m meeting someone here and my phone &apos;s about to die .
and if it dies , i will too .
do you have an outlet ?
screaming in the shower really works for me .
like , right into the water .
super cute . but i do need a phone outlet .
i &apos;ll plug you in , honey ,
and i &apos;ll take care of your phone , too .
girls , meet marie .
hi . seriously , down to 10 % .
oh , did you two meet on &quot; lez meet up &quot; ?
no , honey , i &apos;ve never been on &quot; lez meet up . &quot;
oh , you &apos;re thinking of me , caroline .
you know how much i love lady tail .
this place is amazing .
isn &apos;t it amazing ?
i had the decorator redo it nine times .
you can feel his anger in the walls .
it &apos;s electric .
we &apos;re electric . who is this miracle ?
that &apos;s nash . i found him in the bowery
next to a pile of burning trash .
go say hi .
he &apos;s even creamier and more delicious up close .
you &apos;re eating ? that is so punk rock .
tell me everything right now .
uh , well , i &apos;m a dishwasher .
i &apos;m from ireland .
oh , i was trying to become a model
and i almost did porn an hour ago .
that is the best story i ever heard .
tell it to me again standing up .
but this time , don &apos;t talk .
i see face , i see ass , i see model .
do you have a manager ?
i guess that &apos;d be caroline , the blonde one over there .
blonde one , come over here and talk to me about your client .
i am in love . he &apos;s perfection .
marie prower , senior vp of marketing .
sweet , what company ?
guess .
um , tommy hilfinger .
i work for guess , darling .
no more words . listen .
he &apos;s amazing .
i would tweet about him right now , but my phone is dead .
so bring him into my office on monday .
you heard her , caroline .
bring him into her office tomorrow .
she &apos;s obsessed with me .
max , i was right . he is a model .
get me a hot wife and a hotter woman to cheat on her with ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m a big @-@ time talent manager .
congratulations , dude .
well , i guess if this works out ,
i &apos;m gonna have to quit my job at the diner .
will you be mad at me ?
i &apos;ll be really sad .
i &apos;m gonna miss you a lot , you know ?
not seeing you 24 / 7 .
but i would hate myself
if i didn &apos;t let you follow your dreams .
even if it means
you moving out of the apartment , too .
now go .
here comes that tear again .
i &apos;m all choked up .
max , you would have made a great rosa parks .
if you had been black .
which , i guess , is what they insist on .
but you got him to move out .
you are good .
yeah , well , i mean , he &apos;s cute ,
but i &apos;m not all that cuckoo for his cocoa puffs .
