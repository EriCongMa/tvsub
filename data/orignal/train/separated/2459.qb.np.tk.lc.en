as long as you &apos;re alive , elena will remain asleep .
once you bury a body , the grieving process begins .
oh , i &apos;m not planning on burying her .
i &apos;m planning on bringing her back to life .
who &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s my mother .
lily fell in with a group of witches .
heretics are ruthless ,
vampires with witch power .
enough .
the whole town would have been slaughtered .
pack your things . your family &apos;s not safe here .
surrendering the town is not a solution .
the deal has been made .
we don &apos;t mess them them , they don &apos;t mess with us .
my mother is a lunatic ,
and everyone &apos;s too scared to stop her .
i want to fight . i want our town back .
no .
who did this ? who took him from us ?
someone killed malcolm , and it got me thinking
that if i want people to trust me ,
then i &apos;ve got to earn it .
i reckon it goes without saying i chose lily .
ok , people .
we go live in 30,
so i need that media package done 15 minute ago .
where are my graphics and b @-@ roll ?
jamie , we &apos;re good on music , right ?
yeah . we &apos;re good .
uh , excuse me , caroline .
yeah .
uh , your fiance just called .
what ? he knows that i &apos;m working .
that &apos;s why he didn &apos;t ask to talk to you .
uh , he &apos;s being sneaky , but--
but your paycheck comes from me ,
and you know how much i hate surprises . spill .
he &apos;s curious what your schedule is right before the wedding .
why ?
i think he wants to plan a trip to a mystic falls .
but he knows that we can &apos;t go back there .
um , i will
handle this later .
thanks , tony .
are both cameras on ?
first one &apos;s on , and second one is rolling .
so a few weeks ago , the town of mystic falls
was completely evacuated .
the story is that some natural gas leak made it all uninhabitable ,
but there &apos;s been so many rumors , whispers ,
and just strange things happening in the night ,
unexplainable things .
ok . tone it down , &quot; blair witch . &quot;
let &apos;s see . what &apos;d you bring me , huh ?
full @-@ spectrum light , emf meter ,
and a thermal camera ,
courtesy of uncle fred &apos;s graduation money .
look how hot you are .
you &apos;re hilarious .
ok , so this thing &apos;s supposed to beep
if there &apos;s some spirit
or something supernatural present .
you get this thing off an infomercial or something ?
wait . it &apos;s working .
it &apos;s creepy but kind of awesome .
it won &apos;t open . no lock . it &apos;s just stuck .
looks like there &apos;s a coffin in there or something .
amanda ...
it &apos;s not working .
amanda ...
what ?
there &apos;s something behind you .
are you really trying to scare me ?
amanda .
amanda .
ryan , help .
it &apos;s ok . i &apos;ll get help , ok ?
i &apos;ll be back . i--
much better than those blood bags .
no screaming , please .
how do you know how to work that device ?
i don &apos;t , but if these two could ,
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s idiotproof .
let him go .
mystic falls is our now .
so is any human who steps foot inside it .
i said , let him go .
i want to talk about death .
more specifically , i want to talk about what happens after .
now , i &apos;m not going to pretend like my good looks
are the reason this class is so full .
i &apos;ve heard the same stories you have about mystic falls--
ghost sightings , poltergeists ...
zombies .
zombies .
now let &apos;s talk about it .
what &apos;s behind all of these stories ?
now , almost every single culture has the lore
of a creature or being that cheats death .
why do our brains insist on inventing
the most unbelievable things ?
it &apos;s because the reality of death
is actually the most unbelievable thing of all .
now , the most terrifying thing that you &apos;re going to encounter
in mystic falls is a trespassing ticket .
ok , so everyone just stay out .
so the great mystic falls evacuation plan
isn &apos;t going as well as everyone hoped .
well , they turned it into a ghost town .
that part worked .
unfortunately for us , ghost towns are like
amusement parks for college kids .
the heretics have killed 10 people already--
two last night ,
idiots looking for a ghost selfie .
are you ok ?
damon told me what you were doing in europe .
losing my money and my sanity
to a series of con artists ?
yeah .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m over it .
it &apos;s ok if you &apos;re not , ric .
heck , i &apos;m a little offended you didn &apos;t come to me first .
what , you wouldn &apos;t think it &apos;s weird that
i &apos;m trying to contact my fiance
who &apos;s been dead for months ?
honestly , after everything we &apos;ve experienced ,
it &apos;d be weird if you weren &apos;t .
hey , bonnie ...
have you ever heard of the phoenix stone ?
caroline , haven &apos;t heard from you .
i &apos;m starting to think that maybe you &apos;re just using me
for random , hot make @-@ out sessions ,
which i &apos;m not entirely opposed to ,
but , uh , give me call .
can i help you ?
it &apos;s ok . i speak mute .
just communicate what you want
with a series of grunts .
you &apos;ll have to excuse beau .
he &apos;s not in the mood for glib jokes .
none of us are , actually .
i thought we had a deal .
yeah . we do .
otherwise , i would be at home ,
not out patrolling the streets to keep humans
out of your minion &apos;s fangs .
we found malcolm in the towns square last night ,
his heart removed .
you didn &apos;t know .
no . i didn &apos;t because we didn &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m not here to blame you , stefan .
i came so you &apos;d understand why we did what we had to do .
what did you do ?
sorry , luv .
this will only hurt for a second .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
someone killed malcolm .
lily needed to retaliate .
it &apos;s strange . you don &apos;t look like lily .
yeah . well , it &apos;s all in the lighting , darling .
look . be happy i &apos;m the one who grabbed you .
don &apos;t even want to think of what would happened
if the others did .
i am the closest thing
you have to a friend in here .
well , fun tip--friends don &apos;t really like
to be tied up with vervain rope .
hush now . deep breath .
there you are .
enzo , please .
this hurts really , really bad .
oh , god , i hate whiners .
now ...
deep breath .
leaving so soon ?
i &apos;m wearing your jacket ,
though it &apos;s a little large on me .
it &apos;s all right , you two . i &apos;ve got her .
do you ?
because it certainly doesn &apos;t look like it .
what &apos;s that expression ? finders keepers .
just so we &apos;re clear , i &apos;m taking the master bedroom .
carol lockwood and i had a little thing .
i think she &apos;d want me to have it .
let &apos;s open some windows , too .
reeks of dog in here , which is impressive ,
considering tyler &apos;s been with jeremy for months .
you killed him , didn &apos;t you ?
tyler ? no .
jeremy once , but are we really bringing that up right now ?
the heretic malcolm . lily came by earlier .
she found him in the town square
without a heart .
oh , did she want that back ?
i mean , i think i packed it somewhere , all right ?
you know , lily and i had a deal .
a bad deal .
she took caroline .
what ?
to retaliate for breaking our bad deal ,
she took caroline .
but you weren &apos;t the one that did it .
yeah . i know i wasn &apos;t .
you were , which is why you are gonna go over there
and you &apos;re gonna fix it .
hello , mother .
may i help you ?
couple things .
&quot; a , &quot; who the hell is that ?
who , lucy ?
she &apos;s the kind woman i &apos;ve hired to clean up
this house that you let fall into disrepair .
lucy , darling ,
could you come clean the welcome mat , please ?
this man was just leaving .
&quot; b , &quot; no , i &apos;m not .
excuse me ?
i think there &apos;s been a bit of a mix @-@ up .
see , last night , i was in the town square
minding my own business when i tripped
and accident ripped malcolm &apos;s heart out .
deflecting . of course .
you never could admit when you were wrong .
ok . wait . i admit it . i killed him .
i killed him in cold blood ,
just like that .
stef and caroline had nothing to do with it ,
so if you &apos;ll just kindly let her go--
malcolm was a very powerful heretic , damon .
i have a hard time believing you acted alone .
well , i &apos;m pretty awesome--
in fact , so awesome that i &apos;m such a better hostage than blondie ,
so if you &apos;ll just swap us out--
i &apos;m afraid my family finds you much less awesome than you do .
wait . li--lily--uh !
that &apos;s odd .
why can &apos;t i walk into my own house ?
because this is no longer your house ,
and i have the deed to prove it .
now , if you don &apos;t mind ,
i have to get ready to go bury my son .
an old contact of mine at duke told me about it .
it &apos;s supposed to have resuscitative powers .
resuscitative
as in , it can bring somebody back from the dead ?
and that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t tell you ,
because i was avoiding that look .
where did you find it ?
well , you remember that night in new york ?
yeah , the night that you passed out on the floor of the bar .
the night you pretended to pass out on the floor of the bar .
right . well , i snuck into maritime museum
because this was on display there .
it &apos;s certainly pretty .
i don &apos;t feel any magic emanating from it .
well , you are officially more honest
than anyone i saw in europe .
what are you doing ?
sometimes witches will conceal
a powerful talisman or relic
by hiding the magic inside of it .
bonnie , are you ok ?
bonnie , what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
i saw something , people dying .
there &apos;s something wrong with that stone , ric ,
something evil ...
but your friend from duke told you that , didn &apos;t she ...
which is wis you waited until you were
flat @-@ out desperate before you told me about it .
you can &apos;t mess with that magic , ric .
we have to destroy it .
i only hear one set of footsteps .
and i only hear righteous &quot; i told you so &apos;s . &quot;
look . i offered myself . lily declined .
huh , well , looks like nobody wants you around , do they ?
ah , planning a little midnight raid through the tunnels ?
might be a little , tiny problem with that .
we no longer own the house ,
i.e. , we can &apos;t get in .
what ?
have no fear .
i have a call in with the registrar &apos;s office ,
and i will find out who , exactly ,
does own the house in a matter of minutes ,
at which point , we kill said person ,
storm the castle , and save your damsel .
you &apos;re really enjoying this , aren &apos;t you ?
i got 60 years to kill .
having an enemy , a nemesis ,
a maniacal villain
with maniacal villain motives ?
you kidding me ?
that &apos;s not the worst distraction in the world .
you know , it &apos;s funny that you think
that she &apos;s the villain when you &apos;re the one
who killed one of her loved ones .
you taking her side ?
no , but i &apos;m definitely not taking yours .
what did you do to me ?
what lorenzo should have done--vervain .
oh , it hurts .
yes .
my family ran a slaughterhouse
when i was growing up .
it was all well and good until they found out
i was a siphoner freak of nature .
then they were more than happy
to hang me with the cattle ,
so ... been there , sister .
just be happy i didn &apos;t hang you
by your feet like we do with the cows .
what do you want from me ?
we have a burial to go to .
my girlfriend thinks her outfit
has to be fashion forward .
i disagree . what do you think ?
nora , show us .
help us , and perhaps i can find a small stool
for you to stand on .
i feel silly .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re beautiful , my love .
nobody wears this anymore .
you wore than dress to queen victoria &apos;s funeral .
it &apos;s stunning .
see ?
i asked for advice , not mockery .
yeah . well , you should listen to your girlfriend
because that dress ...
look . my best friend used to live here .
she had good style ,
and i &apos;m sure that a couple of her dresses
are in a closet somewhere .
i &apos;m curious .
what do you think of this color ?
it &apos;s great , actually ,
super vivid .
it &apos;ll totally make your eyes pop .
do you think it &apos;ll make your eyes pop ?
don &apos;t you ever embarrass my girlfriend again .
lorenzo .
i assumed you &apos;d be watching over our house guest .
yeah . that was the plan ,
until she wrapped a vervain @-@ soaked rope around my neck and ran away .
she escaped ?
yeah , temporarily .
mary louise and nora managed to catch her .
now it &apos;s a &quot; no boys allowed &quot; zone .
hmm , how unfortunate for her .
you promised she wouldn &apos;t be hurt .
after you promised she wouldn &apos;t escape .
we &apos;re leaving for the cemetery in a few hours .
i &apos;m sure she can survive until then .
i &apos;d invite you , but we need someone to stay here at the house .
i know it &apos;s not quite fair ,
but lily usually lets mary louise and nora get away with murder .
you can still get what you want .
you just have to go around her .
spare me the family politics .
you chose your side .
right or wrong , there &apos;s no going back .
oh , so i should condone
someone i care about being tortured ?
no . you should just stop caring about her .
thanks .
bonnie bennett , destroyer of dreams .
so i take it things didn &apos;t go well with ric ?
he wants to bring jo back to life
with a stone that &apos;s filled with evil incarnate .
yep . sounds about right .
so about how long do we have before this evil engulfs the world ?
just trying to plan my week .
i convinced him to drop it in a vat of acid ,
so i think we &apos;re good .
how are you ?
oh , you know , just trying to figure out
how to break into my own damn house .
i no longer own it . lily signed over the deed .
why would she do that ?
probably because she didn &apos;t want us to rescue caroline .
she took caroline ? when ? why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because i &apos;m going to get her back ,
and i didn &apos;t want you to do the very thing
that you &apos;re about to do .
it &apos;s because we killed malcolm .
yep . there she goes .
this is all my fault .
listen to me .
killing malcolm is classic damon ,
has nothing to do with you .
everybody knows that .
you &apos;re covering for me ?
because i need your head in the game , bon .
i have a mission for you .
it involves the person who owns my house .
not a heretic .
sorry . rough day .
not to be the bearer of bad news ,
but it &apos;s about to get rougher .
so i own the salvatore house ?
it &apos;s pretty brilliant , really .
they drain the vervain from your blood ,
compel you to sign the deed ,
compel to not invite stefan and damon in ,
and compel you to forget any of it ever happened ,
and , bingo , the house is an impenetrable fortress ,
and vampires can &apos;t rescue caroline .
great , so the only way to break the seal is for me to die .
bon , please tell me that that &apos;s not the plan .
well , what do you think about letting me
use magic to stop your heart ?
so you &apos;re gonna kill me ?
temporarily .
but won &apos;t it reset when i wake up ?
no . once you die , the threshold spell is broken .
if they want to reseal the house ,
they &apos;ll have to sign over the deed to someone else .
so damon screws up ,
caroline gets grabbed , and i end up dead ?
doesn &apos;t it ever feel like we &apos;re fighting the wrong enemy ?
we don &apos;t have time for a debate , matt .
caroline needs us . you in , or you out ?
nora or mary louise ?
mary louise .
lucky .
she &apos;s the nice one .
yeah , not if you laugh at nora .
you didn &apos;t .
i couldn &apos;t help it .
ah , that dress .
the queen victoria one ?
oh , you shouldn &apos;t have said anything .
it would have been hilarious .
what , you don &apos;t get along with them ?
once ...
i made a snide comment about nora &apos;s hair ,
and mary louise poisoned my food for a month .
they &apos;re the worst , but i can help .
phaesmatos extandas lomiano .
why the hell are you in here ?
just looking for this .
see , i heard of this new fashion trend called hooker chic .
i figured you &apos;d have something .
thanks .
what did she say to you ?
that bitch !
good thing i don &apos;t need to touch you to do this .
tick tock .
ok . let &apos;s go . lily &apos;s waiting .
what about oscar ?
he &apos;s not back yet ,
and apparently , his errand is too important .
of course it is .
meanwhile , we &apos;re stuck here until he &apos;s done .
cute .
thank you .
6 minutes .
that &apos;s how long your heart can be stopped
before anything bad happens to you .
which doesn &apos;t matter because you &apos;re only gonna stop it
for 10 seconds , right ?
matt , if you don &apos;t want to do this--
no . it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s for caroline .
let &apos;s--let &apos;s just do it .
look . he &apos;s never gonna agree to it .
donovan knows plan &quot; b &quot; is , i just simply kill him .
it &apos;s good to see your morality is holding up in elena &apos;s absence .
so are you and carebear , like , a thing now , hmm ?
i &apos;m not doing this with you , damon .
i &apos;m just saying , when a guy &apos;s willing
to let another guy die so his girl can live ,
there &apos;s usually something , cooking in the kitchen .
you know what i mean ?
i am not willing to let matt die .
yeah . well , you just did , brother .
seal &apos;s down .
i &apos;ll take the front door . enjoy the tunnels .
that works .
good to know .
hello there , old friend .
you &apos;ll have to excuse me for not responding
to that particular term of endearment .
may i help you ?
actually , you can .
i don &apos;t know if you know this ,
but last night , lily kidnapped caroline ,
not very cool , so i know we &apos;ve had our issues ,
but i also know that you &apos;re not like lily &apos;s crazy @-@ tics ,
so i was thinking , help me get her back ?
that would be foolish of me ,
considering i &apos;m the one who kidnapped her .
you know , i never thought i &apos;d see the day
when you &apos;d choose to be lily &apos;s errand boy over us , but--
i chose you and your friends many times .
many times , you and your friends
chose each other over me .
let &apos;s just say that lily and i have
similar views on loyalty .
you know she abandoned her entire family once .
who &apos;s to say she won &apos;t do it again ?
she didn &apos;t abandon her family .
she merely abandoned her relatives .
there &apos;s a difference .
yeah .
one is a permanent blood tie ,
a name , a legacy .
well , in her eyes , malcolm was more a salvatore than you ever were .
why else would she bury him
in the family crypt next to elena ?
that crypt is sealed shut .
oh , right .
oh , well , then it &apos;s a good thing
that she &apos;s mother bear to a group of magic siphoners .
it &apos;s a little gaudy .
pull out elena &apos;s coffin and dump in the body
in the river under the falls .
she can spend the next 60 years of her life underwater .
oh , no . oh , my god .
phesmatos songuine infundare corra .
phesmatos songuine infundare corra .
phesmatos songuine infundare corra .
come on , matt .
phesmatos songuine infundare corra .
thank god .
awfully long 10 seconds , bon .
stefan ?
is it you , or am i hallucinating ?
what &apos;d they do to you ?
you mean before or after the gallon of vervain
they injected me with ?
i &apos;m going to get you out of here . just hang on .
already doing that .
looks like i &apos;m gonna have to swoop you up
and carry you out of here .
well , the feminist in me says no , but ...
it &apos;s like your skin is vervain .
valerie &apos;s spell .
hello ?
anybody burying somebody nobody cared about ?
no .
no . no .
no , no , no , no .
you always did throw the worst tantrums .
where is she ?
that &apos;s the fun of cloaking spells , damon .
she could be right next to you ,
or she could be a million miles away ,
and i &apos;m the only one who knows where she is .
you want to punish me for what i did ?
fine . do it .
punish me . torture me .
kill me for all i care ,
but leave elena out of this .
do you remember when you broke my grandmother &apos;s vase ?
what ?
you were young , 10 maybe .
you denied it ,
even when your father
made you cut a switch from the yard ,
even when he beat you with it until you were bloody .
still , you denided it vehemently .
you were sitting there playing
with your little toy soldiers , bloody and bruised ,
so i switched tactics , and the next morning
when you woke , your room was bare--
no toy soldiers , no toys at all ,
and you cried and cried ,
admitted everything .
she &apos;s not a toy soldier .
and malcolm was not a vase .
malcolm was a vital part of this family .
he meant something to each one of us .
he found me on the streets .
he was kind to me ,
something i hadn &apos;t felt in years .
he &apos;s the one who convinced me to meet with lily .
my family wanted me dead .
malcolm made sure they didn &apos;t succeed .
i hadn &apos;t seen beau in a decade .
malcolm reunited us .
he was my sounding board ,
my confidant ,
my eldest son .
ironic that you took him from me .
all right .
tell me what you want .
one of the heretics was torturing me .
the other one said that she would help .
i just thought that it would only burn them .
it &apos;s all right . when we get out of here , we &apos;ll call bonnie .
there &apos;s got to be a way to get rid of this .
as for now , we have to ...
avoid skin @-@ to @-@ skin contact .
i know that &apos;s gonna be extra hard for you .
i &apos;m gonna call damon and tell him that we &apos;re ready .
stefan , do you feel that ?
what &apos;s happening ?
i don &apos;t know . i feel like every molecule in my body is being pulled .
stefan ! stef--
ok . invite her in .
caroline , please come in .
sorry , luv .
i think we should go to the hospital just in case .
and say what ?
&quot; my friend used magic to stop my heart for 6 minutes .
how &apos;s my brain ? &quot;
matt , i am so sorry .
i got hit with these visions .
this isn &apos;t your fault .
this is all happening because of damon .
that &apos;s the thing , matt . it &apos;s--it &apos;s not .
what ?
what you said to me yesterday ,
you were right .
the heretics are here because of me ,
and when i saw our town , our home , like this ,
i helped damon kill malcolm .
when i found out they took caroline ,
it was my idea to stop your heart .
i refuse to stand by and let them do whatever they want .
i drive up and down these streets every day ,
streets that , for my entire life , were filled with people ,
families , kids ,
and now i pray that i see empty parks and empty playgrounds .
i pray that i don &apos;t see a soul , and i hate that .
i hate them .
then why don &apos;t we stop fighting
and do something about it ?
you left .
i could have gotten her back , but you left .
what , no comeback , hmm ?
no funny reason ?
answer me !
better get it out while you can , brother .
i &apos;m not gonna be here much longer .
what the hell are you talking about ?
where are you going ?
i believe lily &apos;s exact words were ,
&quot; as far from mystic falls as humanly possible . &quot;
now , i &apos;m no google maps , but i &apos;m thinking
that &apos;s pretty far away .
she has elena .
she &apos;s making me leave town , dude , for good .
if the roles were reversed , what would you have done ?
she has caroline .
oh , she has elena . she has our house .
she has this whole damn town .
she has all of our toys .
stefan , whenever i did anything wrong as a kid ,
she took my toys ,
but she also took yours , all of them ,
and you &apos;d cry like a little baby .
i &apos;d do anything , anything she wanted , to shut you up .
this is her plan .
she &apos;s slowly taking away everything we care about .
she wants us to be mad at each other .
you &apos;re right . you and i fight ...
while her and her family of freaks live in our house ,
getting closer and closer .
fine . then we don &apos;t let her fracture us .
or we do .
you complain to lily about your worthless brother that left town .
all the while , i &apos;m doing a little fracturing of my own .
how you gonna do that ?
there were 4 heretics at the funeral .
dead malcolm makes 5,
but in 1903,
there were 6,
which means there &apos;s one more ,
and i &apos;m gonna find him ,
and i &apos;m gonna negotiate a trade .
we &apos;re gonna get them both back .
did it work ?
yeah .
hello , hydrofluoric acid , and good @-@ bye phoenix stone .
good . see you in class tomorrow .
how was the burial ?
as lovely as a burial could be , i suppose .
i noticed caroline is still being held in the girls &apos; room .
would you like me to speak with them
about letting her stay with you ?
oh , i don &apos;t need you to advocate for me .
she made her bed .
perhaps it &apos;s time she should lie in it .
what about your bed ?
have you decided which room you &apos;ll take ?
do you consider me a part of your family
like the others ?
why , yes , of course .
i care for you as much as i do them .
and therein lies the problem .
i &apos;m not here to be one of your children , lily .
then why are you here , lorenzo ?
why did you choose us ?
well , there was no &quot; us &quot; in my choice .
i chose you .
i am here because of you .
i &apos;m taking the guest room in the east wing .
good night .
don &apos;t get cocky .
you &apos;re still spelled into the room ,
but i figured you could use some space
to stretch your legs and maybe give this a read .
what is it ?
i know you think valerie was doing you a favor ,
that she &apos;s the nice one , and , trust me ,
she &apos;s the worst of all of us .
it &apos;s stefan &apos;s .
she never goes anywhere without it .
what is valerie doing with stefan &apos;s journal ?
it &apos;s the first thing she looked for
when we realized we were trapped in 1903 .
the entry for july 15 , 1863 , should tell you why .
i just had the strangest encounter outside the county fair .
i met someone , a girl .
we only spoke for a moment , but her name is valerie ,
and she may be the most wonderful girl i have ever met .
and we &apos;re out .
great show , everyone .
i will catch you at the grapevine in a bit .
i got first round .
great , i &apos;ll be there .
ok , so let &apos;s call my fiance back
and talk about this mystic falls business ,
and don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m not gonna tell him that you told me .
no .
actually , you got another call during the show ,
someone named stefan salvatore .
uh , it sounded urgent .
well , if he calls back ,
tell him that i &apos;m not here ,
and i never want to hear the name
stefan salvatore ever again .
got it ?
i &apos;m sorry . that was a bit harsh .
