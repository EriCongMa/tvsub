第七季 第十八集
so , greek orthodox , huh ?
i &apos;m just curious .
yep .
for how long ?
long time .
your parents ?
yeah , i have parents .
were your parents greek orthodox ?
yeah .
so you believe in god ?
yep .
you believe he &apos;s watching us now ?
yeah .
‭ so you believe this is fornication .
first two were .
the last one-- i don &apos;t know what i would call that .
does it bother you ?
a bit .
oh , no .
this fallen woman is dragging you down .
you know what &apos;s weird ?
i &apos;m more judgmental about my daughter &apos;s christianity than yours .
why is that ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re a bad person .
i don &apos;t want you to feel like you &apos;re doing wrong
when you &apos;re with me .
yeah , you do .
yeah , i guess i do .
what time is it ?
it is ten after 9 : 00 .
it &apos;s probably diane .
yep .
hey , diane .
yes .
okay . i &apos;ll see you there .
court ?
yeah . another dipple case .
privacy this time .
‭ don &apos;t get up .
i want to picture you in my bed .
all day .
just eating bonbons , watching daytime tv .
you have a nice day , dear .
this is the footage taken from ms. hamm &apos;s drone ?
yes , that &apos;s my understanding .
and that , that is your house right there , isn &apos;t it ?
yes . 1547 oakmont .
did you grant permission for the drone to fly over it ?
no . absolutely not .
and how often does it do that ?
every day . sometimes several times a day ,
at unpredictable times .
it has to be unpredictable .
that &apos;s the basic principle of security sweeps .
ms. hamm , please .
your lawyer will argue for you .
and , uh , why is the drone such a problem for you ?
well , it &apos;s my business .
i &apos;m a therapist . i practice out of my house .
and do your patients complain ?
yes . some have even quit .
they depend on me for privacy and they get this-- surveillance .
and that is why you &apos;re suing
the owner of the drone ?
yes .
her drone has led to my business losses .
thank you . nothing more .
look at her .
‭ do patients park in your garage , dr. nachmann ?
my garage ?
no . i turned that into my office .
i see . then do patients enter your garage office
through a covered walkway ?
no .
so they park on the street ,
then walk up to your house ,
where anyone who happens to be around could see them ?
yes .
‭ how is that different from being observed by a drone ?
well , i guess you expect it from someone on the street
but not from the sky .
and how much are you suing my client for , sir ?
$ 300,000 .
and yet you have two top partners at your table .
objection , your honor .
i haven &apos;t even gotten to my question yet .
why don &apos;t we wait till she gets to her question ,
then i &apos;ll sustain .
i used to work for their firm , your honor .
and this case wouldn &apos;t even be considered
unless there was an ulterior motive .
objection , your honor .
that has nothing to do with this case .
but it does , your honor .
this case is a fiction . it is a trial balloon sent up
by reese dipple , a reactionary billionaire
who thinks that we are out to take
your honor , she is trying
their guns , their christmases ...
to play to your bias .
and the sanctity of their homes .
yes . and yet ...
we have to deal with the case in front of us .
i agree .
i just wish the plaintiffs were more honest .
well , this is a surprise .
when did you come back to the law ?
a month ago .
zoe started nursery school .
is that your daughter ?
yes .
oh , my god , she &apos;s beautiful .
so you &apos;re happy ?
i am .
and you &apos;re good in court .
how did you know it was dipple ?
it was a guess .
two partners on this case , it made no sense .
i learned from the best .
is my wife here ?
she &apos;s in court .
you &apos;re her investigator ?
yeah .
we are still married .
i &apos;ll get my things .
yeah , that would be good .
how long has this been going on ?
that &apos;s a question for alicia .
does grace know ?
again ...
alicia .
you &apos;re in my way .
you &apos;re screwing my wife
and i &apos;m in your way ?
at the moment , yes .
i should kick your ass .
you could try .
and then what ?
one goji @-@ gasm with a virility boost !
good luck with that .
i know who you are .
and i know who you are .
so we can skip the part where you pretend you want to date me .
what can i help you with , sir ?
you can help me put peter florrick in jail .
how &apos; bout a super @-@ c quencher instead ?
well , i can subpoena you to testify against your father .
okay , here &apos;s the thing : i am nobody .
my last five jobs , i needed to wear name tags .
i live with three roommates , and one is a squatter .
this has nothing to do with me . so you and your little ...
fbi friend should take your show somewhere else .
&quot; judge schakowsky won &apos;t be a problem . &quot;
&quot; how can you be sure &quot; &quot; &quot; he owes me . he &apos;d be in jail
right now on bribery charges if i hadn &apos;t warned him &quot; &quot;
hi , this is marissa from the juice bar .
we need mall security . there &apos;s a man here
harassing employees , who refuses to leave .
i want you to give your father a message from me , ms. gold .
i don &apos;t know . let me ask him .
how tall are you ?
tell him he has two choices .
he can testify against peter florrick ,
or i can use your testimony to put him in jail
for obstruction of justice .
looks like 5 @-@ 11,
dark hair , kind of a mean look in his eye .
wait , i think he &apos;s leaving .
thanks .
howard !
how can i be of service ?
we need you to move offices .
why ? i like this office .
it &apos;s close to the bathroom .
you &apos;re emeritus , howard .
and this is a high profile , very visible space .
where clients can get a good look at your ...
your work ethic .
we have a space on the 27th floor .
it &apos;s all arranged .
27th floor ?
that &apos;s for losers .
this isn &apos;t a negotiation , howard .
and who , uh , may i ask , am i being evicted for ?
alicia .
alicia . of course .
it &apos;s all beginning to make sense .
all right . i need to get to court .
but , please , let &apos;s get this moving .
so you &apos;re , uh ...
throwing in with the girls , huh ?
i &apos;m not &quot; throwing in &quot; &quot; with anyone , howard .
i &apos;m just trying to do what &apos;s best for the firm .
we &apos;ve had problems with mail theft ,
bikes gone missing , a car vandalized .
so that &apos;s when you bought the drone
and started picketfencewatch.com ?
yes . it &apos;s too big an area for volunteers to secure ,
so the drone makes it easier to monitor .
have any of your other neighbors complained about your drone ?
or is it just dr. nachmann ?
no . people love it .
thank you , ms. hamm . being a mother myself ,
i can understand the worth of such a safety tool .
objection . counselor is testifying .
actually , my apologies , i thought i was just reacting .
really ? is that what a reaction sounds like ?
yes , the same way you &apos;re reacting now .
excuse me . please let me rule on the objection .
sustained .
nothing further , your honor .
so why not just fly it over your other neighbors &apos; houses
and leave dr. nachmann alone ?
avoiding his house would mean not covering
a lot of other people who want it .
but by &quot; covering &quot; this area , you mean not just
the public area , like the street ,
you also look into people &apos;s backyards .
i have to .
criminals don &apos;t just use the front door .
do you ever pick up images from inside their houses ?
no .
is that a person there ,
inside their house ?
i guess .
did that person give you permission to photograph them ?
i would never upload anything like that to the site .
‭ your honor ,
this is a clear case of intrusion upon seclusion .
it is well @-@ established that a person
has a reasonable expectation
to privacy in his own home .
no , it is a clear case of reese dipple trying
to create law .
your honor !
look ! the expectation of privacy
is in relation to government surveillance .
if dr. nachmann simply uses some discretion
by pulling his blinds ...
he shouldn &apos;t have to .
your honor , we have to weigh the minor inconvenience
to dr. nachmann against the significant
public interest in preventing crime .
so we do .
the incursions into our privacy are already so severe , judge .
as much as i despair and sympathize
with our privacy being trampled on by new technologies ,
the facts in this case simply don &apos;t warrant abridging
ms. hamm &apos;s first amendment rights .
dr. nachmann , your petition for a declaratory judgment is denied .
the drone can fly .
what the hell are you doing ?
not you . i &apos;ll call you back .
i &apos;ve been booted .
exiled to the 27th floor .
for doing what ?
nothing . make room for alicia .
the next step in diane &apos;s push for an all @-@ female @-@ led firm .
diane pushed ,
but the gerbil ... stood by-- he never said a word .
cary &apos;s in on this ?
first she came for the young guys ,
then the older guys .
pretty soon ... there won &apos;t be anybody left to speak for you .
are you all right ?
you seem a little out of it .
just tired .
well , why don &apos;t you go home ?
no .
well , maybe in a little while .
it &apos;s been a weird time , huh ?
what do you mean ?
us jumping from firm to firm .
all the changes .
it was easier when we started out .
well ...
yeah .
not necessarily better .
go home , cary . take a nap .
an afternoon off isn &apos;t gonna change anything .
作证传票
that &apos;s your client .
we &apos;re countersuing .
that drone was an $ 80,000 prototype .
and we &apos;ll assess punitive .
see you in court , then .
your offices look great , by the way .
dipple won &apos;t back our client after that , will he ?
i don &apos;t know . the doctor has good aim ...
and reese dipple loves the second amendment .
sorry i &apos;m late .
jason ?
hey , this is jason . leave a message .
hey . where are you ?
i &apos;m alone here .
call me when you get this .
未接来电
i &apos;m just saying , he knew details .
what kind of details ?
he had a transcript
of an entire phone conversation you and i had .
about ?
judge schakowsky .
he ... what ?
how you tipped that judge off about the fbi sting .
the only way he could know that
is if he had a wiretap in the governor &apos;s office .
is he insane ?
he &apos;s like an evil boy scout .
he said he wants you to testify against peter at the trial .
‭ wait ... did he say &quot; trial &quot; or &quot; grand jury &quot; ?
&quot; trial , &quot; i think . is that important ?
if he said &quot; trial , &quot; that means he knows
he &apos;s gonna get an indictment .
he definitely said &quot; trial &quot; &quot;
damn it !
that &apos;s you shooting the drone down , isn &apos;t it ?
yes . that is me .
your honor , we request an immediate judgment
as a matter of law-- dr. nachmann just admitted
to violating your ruling .
your honor , you said the drone could fly .
you didn &apos;t say mr. nachmann couldn &apos;t protect his property .
oh , come on .
is that an objection ?
no , it &apos;s an expression of amazement .
show me in the order where ...
no one needs to spell it out .
no one did spell it out .
and by analogy to the rule of lenity ...
解读必须倾向于对被告有利
oh , lenity . where are we going next ,
expressio unius ?
则排除其他未指定的人或物
oh , well , now that you mention it ...
your yonor , please ,
isn &apos;t it implicit in your order
not to shoot at my client &apos;s drone ?
why ?
it &apos;s illegal to discharge a firearm
in chicago but not in oak park .
it &apos;s not the weapon we &apos;re objecting to .
it &apos;s the target .
we ask for compensatory damages in the amount
of $ 80,000 , and $ 10,000 in punitives ,
along with a clear instruction from the court
that the defendant may not shoot drones out of the sky .
actually , your honor , i would like an opportunity
to examine him first .
he &apos;s already admitted to shooting it down .
but he didn &apos;t admit to doing anything wrong .
may i ?
by all means .
dr. nachmann , did you feel threatened by the drone
flying over your house yesterday ?
yes . i did .
threatened ? seriously ?
did you believe it was making
a violent , riotous , or tumultuous assault ?
yeah , with all the noise and the hovering , absolutely .
oh , this is ridiculous .
did you believe
what you did was necessary to repel the drone ?
very much so .
720 ilcs 5 / 7 @-@ 2 allows the use of force
in defense of one &apos;s dwelling .
castle doctrine ? you &apos;re applying castle doctrine ?
your honor , this is still about mr. dipple &apos;s
libertarian fantasies ...
again , the plaintiff is attempting to provoke bias .
castle doctrine allows the use of force
to the extent necessary to terminate or prevent unlawful entry .
are you saying dr. nachmann thought
the drone was going to enter his home ?
drones are capable of doing more than record video , your honor .
they can steal , interfere with ,
and destroy things inside the house
without ever entering .
the drone overflight was a de facto intrusion ,
which means castle doctrine applies .
honestly ... is that a reasonable fear ?
no !
yes !
then prove it .
you just sat there
and let diane beam alicia up to our floor ?
do you realize that the camel &apos;s nose is already in our tent ...
that was the lesser of two evils .
what &apos;s the other evil ?
having a pantless octogenarian scaring away clients .
we &apos;re name partners , david .
nobody can move us out .
together we have more equity
in this place than diane does . and ...
if we have to play that trump card ... so be it .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re confident or covering ,
but i do know this : this is war .
and before the women make their next move ,
we need to fire a shot across their bow .
mr. pert , what are we seeing there ?
an unmanned aircraft system--
drone , in common parlance--
modified to carry ar @-@ 15 machine gun .
with all due respect , dr. nachmann would have known
if ms. hamm &apos;s drone was carrying a machine gun .
thank you , your honor .
but drones can carry more than just machine guns , can &apos;t they ?
absolutely .
did that drone have a handgun attached to it ?
a beretta pico .
only about five inches long .
drones can be fitted to carry virtually any weapon .
okay , uh , this is , uh , entertaining ,
but i &apos;m not sure why it &apos;s relevant .
it &apos;s not .
the havoc that drones can wreak
isn &apos;t limited to weapons , is it , doctor ?
‭ no . it &apos;s almost impossible to tell unless you take it apart ,
but this drone has a camera that does thermal imaging .
now , this drone looks like a basic hobbyist &apos;s toy ,
when , in fact , it &apos;s equipped with a ... wi @-@ fi router
that tricks your computer into connecting with it .
and what happens when they connect ?
it steals your personal data : contacts bank information .
i think it &apos;s been established that
my client &apos;s drone has none of these modifications .
yes , but our client had no way of knowing .
isn &apos;t that right , doctor ?
drones can absolutely intrude
on a person &apos;s home without entering it .
if that &apos;s what dr. nachmann said he was afraid of , he &apos;s smart .
you study and develop drone technology
at chicago polytech , is that right ?
yes .
would that include the study of flight paths and trajectories ?
yes , of course .
now , if you could tell me ,
before my client &apos;s drone is shot out of the sky ,
is it hovering in a stationary position ,
or moving toward dr. nachmann &apos;s home ?
well , that drone actually looks like
it &apos;s flying away from the house .
so even if ms. hamm &apos;s drone had
attempted a violent or illegal intrusion ,
it was in fact retreating .
and under illinois law , including the castle doctrine ,
it is illegal to shoot an intruder in the back
if he , or in this case it , is retreating .
damn .
yep .
she &apos;s right on the law .
damages in the amount of $ 10,000 are awarded to ms. hamm .
dr. nachmann ... don &apos;t shoot at drones .
nice office .
it &apos;s very comfortable . thank you .
‭ terrific .
because i think you &apos;re gonna be in here for a while .
i need examples where a pre @-@ nup was deemed invalid
due to ... unconscionable terms .
okay . illinois , right ?
illinois , but i want to be belt @-@ and @-@ suspenders on this .
let &apos;s make it a 50 @-@ state survey .
great . uh , but alicia has asked me
to finish this business development plan .
let me give you three reasons why i don &apos;t care .
number one : i outrank alicia .
numbers two and three :
they don &apos;t matter ,
because i outrank alicia .
your intimidation tactics may have worked on my daughter ,
but they will not work on me !
hello , eli . would you like to sit down ?
you do not want the inspector general ,
let alone the new york times , to learn that you put
a wiretap in the office of a sitting governor !
will you please give us a second ?
i didn &apos;t tap his office , eli .
i tapped your daughter &apos;s phone .
you wh ...
yep . awful , huh ?
the lengths an ausa will go to arrest someone
who simply does something ... criminal .
she worked for lloyd garber ,
who i was investigating ,
so i had probable cause .
my daughter knows nothing about anything illegal
lloyd garber or peter florrick did ...
may have done .
agreed . but she does have knowledge
of something illegal you did .
you &apos;re squeezing my daughter to get to me .
i &apos;m not a big fan of the word &quot; squeezing , &quot; but ...
yes .
‭ i know nothing about the locke mistrial .
good . then you have nothing to worry about .
you have a choice , a simple choice .
help me take down peter florrick ,
or your daughter helps me take you down .
all right , then , i will see you tomorrow .
no , just a few questions .
thank you .
what are you doing working up here ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s quieter .
i missed you last night .
just ... work .
well , what are you doing tonight ?
look , alicia ...
i like you . i like you a lot .
seriously ?
what do you want me to say ?
i don &apos;t want you to say anything .
i want you to do what you did the other day .
i want you ...
she was ...
can you give us a minute ? please ?
i want to use you and i want you to use me .
this is purely sexual .
i like it , too .
is this about your religion ?
no .
because i don &apos;t want your spirit .
i want your body .
it &apos;s not about that .
then what ?
your husband came home yesterday morning .
oh , god .
what ?
look , whatever he said ,
whatever he did , it has nothing to do with us .
i just don &apos;t like coming in the middle of something .
we &apos;ll meet at your place tonight .
no . it &apos;s not really ...
well , then we &apos;ll go to a hotel .
side of the road . backseat of my car .
i &apos;m seeing you tonight . at my apartment .
after that , you can do whatever you want .
alicia , how are you ?
peachy .
your client shot down another drone .
this time , not with a gun ,
but with an electronic device called a drone dropper .
alicia , you need to talk to your client .
i don &apos;t need to do anything .
alicia , i &apos;m a little busy here .
give me a second .
what &apos;s going on ?
alicia ?
i want a divorce .
i want a divorce .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing &apos;s wrong .
i want a divorce .
yeah , well , i &apos;m in the middle of something .
okay , you take care of that .
i &apos;ll have my lawyer call you .
this is about your investigator , isn &apos;t it ?
my investigator ?
yes .
i would never think of divorcing you
unless i had some other man to call my own .
come here .
i saw him yesterday ,
walking around in his boxer shorts ,
acting like he owned the place .
yes , because i own the place ,
and i told him he was welcome to walk around naked if he wants .
and grace ? oh , you don &apos;t give a damn about your daughter .
yes . i &apos;m an unfit mother .
in the divorce ,
you can get full custody for the three weeks
before she goes to college .
well , this must be true love .
again .
is that what would upset you most ?
if i was in love ?
no , what upsets me the most is that you &apos;re shoving it in my face .
i &apos;m not shoving anything .
this is me not caring .
not caring what people think .
what eli thinks . you think .
or what the fbi thinks .
you know i &apos;m about to be indicted , don &apos;t you ?
peter , you &apos;re always being indicted .
if it weren &apos;t today , it would be tomorrow .
i &apos;ll have my lawyer call .
thanks .
you told dr. nachmann not to shoot a drone ,
so he brought it down safely and he returned it .
well , was the drone returned to ms. hamm in one piece ?
it was , but ...
why are you bothering me with this ?
he gave the drone back , it wasn &apos;t damaged .
because it &apos;s against the law .
faa rules prohibit interfering with
the operation of an aircraft midflight ,
including by disabling it .
your honor ...
18 u.s.c. 32 applies to airplanes and helicopters .
not unmanned drones .
actually , the law applies to any aircraft in the
special aircraft jurisdiction of the united states .
and are drones
in the special aircraft division of the united states ?
no !
yes .
drones must be registered with the faa .
but whether that puts them
within faa jurisdiction would depend on
the height at which the drone was flying .
and the faa &apos;s draft regulation on drones
is unclear on this issue .
oh , well , then perhaps we should
talk to someone from the faa .
if peter sent you ...
he didn &apos;t .
well , what do you need ?
can i talk to you ?
privately ?
uh , certainly .
i need a lawyer .
you do ? or peter does ?
peter has mike tascioni .
and this may be an instance where ...
my interests and the governor &apos;s ... diverge .
understood .
so everything i &apos;m about to say
will be covered under attorney @-@ client privilege ?
and you can &apos;t share this with alicia .
i understand .
the federal prosecutor , connor fox ,
is trying to force me to testify against peter at trial .
okay , well , if or when you &apos;re subpoenaed ,
you can obviously take the fifth .
i &apos;m not worried about incriminating myself ,
i don &apos;t know anything .
but the ausa doesn &apos;t believe that .
no .
well , if you truly don &apos;t know anything ,
why don &apos;t you just get up there and say that ?
here &apos;s the problem .
i ... told my daughter something that i did
that may have ...
obstructed justice .
and he &apos;s going to force marissa to testify against you
if you don &apos;t help him take down peter .
so what do i do ?
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m hiding .
from who ?
david lee .
he dumped a 50 @-@ state survey on me .
oh , yeah .
he likes to haze newcomers .
mm , it felt like more than that .
he &apos;s probably feeling threatened .
diane &apos;s ...
diane &apos;s been aggressive about this female @-@ led firm idea .
are we taking over ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know if i have the stomach for a gender war right now .
would we make more money ?
probably .
come on in .
i need your help with something .
funny thing .
i need yours . you start .
david lee is hazing lucca . he &apos;s got her doing
a pointless 50 @-@ state survey to complete overnight .
yeah , he did that to me when i started . you , too .
yes , but lucca was my partner .
and when you convinced me to come back ,
i convinced her .
okay . now i have a favor to ask you ....
sure .
don &apos;t side with diane .
with what ?
you know with what .
cary ...
i &apos;m not a name partner .
but you &apos;re a name .
this is none of my business .
it &apos;s between you and diane .
and you can &apos;t take sides ?
okay .
good to know .
so ... you &apos;ll help lucca ?
i &apos;ll see .
you work for the federal aviation administration , mr. ortiz ?
i do-- the enforcement and compliance division .
so you &apos;re familiar with the faa &apos;s
proposed regulation on drones ?
it &apos;s pretty much all we &apos;re talking about internally these days .
could you explain for us what class g airspace is ?
it &apos;s the band that the faa doesn &apos;t control .
it &apos;s between zero and 500 feet ,
not including approaches to airports .
and above 500 feet , it would be illegal
to disable a drone aircraft ,
for example , by using a device such as the drone dropper ?
that is correct .
but below 500 feet ,
that is not the faa &apos;s jurisdiction ?
your honor , point of information ?
regarding ?
united states v. causby .
that &apos;s c @-@ a @-@ u @-@ s @-@ b @-@ y ,
not ... the other way .
thank you .
uh , that case established
that an individual &apos;s property rights include
at least as much of the airspace above the ground
as one could occupy or use in connection with the land .
do we have a number ?
83 feet .
exactly 83 feet ?
that was the height below which the court found
an airplane flying over mr. causby &apos;s land would frighten his chickens .
of course .
my client &apos;s drone was
at 200 feet and therefore not on dr. nachmann &apos;s property .
your honor , this is preposterous .
that &apos;s a 70 @-@ year @-@ old case .
but still good law .
but it &apos;s hardly applicable to what
we &apos;ve seen is cutting @-@ edge technology .
the law &apos;s the law .
well , as far as the faa is concerned ,
if a drone is flying at 83 feet or below ,
dr. nachmann would be within his rights to take it down .
and above 500 feet , it would be illegal .
and at 200 feet ?
well , it &apos;s not clearly his property at that point ,
but it &apos;s not clearly ... not .
as a representative of the faa &apos;s legal department ,
would you like to clear that up ?
no .
well , we &apos;re waiting to hear from the public and private sectors before
we regulate class g airspace .
so for the time being ...
between 83 and 500 feet , it &apos;s the wild , wild west .
i hired an attorney . a good one .
glad you passed on all the bad ones , but what &apos;s the plan ?
developing .
it sounds like you &apos;re putting me off .
don &apos;t worry about me .
i &apos;m worried about me , too .
i &apos;m a small person , and it would be a lot of guilt
to carry around , putting you away .
all you have to do is hold tight and do not speak to ausa fox .
dad , do you not want to testify
against peter florrick because you don &apos;t think
he did anything wrong or are you still trying to protect him ?
wait a minute ! wait a minute !
david !
it &apos;s as if you &apos;re ,
as if you are the only person on the letterhead .
i don &apos;t know , diane . we ... oh ...
it &apos;s getting really creepy around here .
all right .
david , just calm down ! i &apos;ll tell you ...
we all have the same long @-@ term goals .
world domination .
to turn this into the premier full @-@ service law firm in chicago .
you mean the premier female @-@ led law firm .
listen , we &apos;re not gonna ride into the future on howard lyman &apos;s back .
i don &apos;t care about howard , but your elevation
of alicia florrick ...
makes sense .
she &apos;s been back here for barely a minute
and you have her stepping over bodies .
alicia &apos;s name is a big draw to clients .
you didn &apos;t even want her .
i was shortsighted .
or i was .
alicia has weathered a lot of challenges--
peter &apos;s , her own-- but she could still be an asset
to this firm , and that matters to all of us .
oh , cut the crap !
what &apos;s your move ?
make alicia a name partner .
no .
i can bring this to the entire partnership .
you think you have the votes ?
i think i can get them .
do you really want to tear this firm apart to find out ?
so , uh ... i don &apos;t get my office back , huh ?
not any time soon .
and there &apos;s no way to stop the estrogen army ?
not without a big fight .
which you don &apos;t want to have .
i &apos;m just not sure it &apos;s worth it .
well , i will see you
on the 27th floor , pal .
oh , i &apos;m not giving up .
i &apos;m just saying there &apos;s other things to consider .
like what ?
money .
howard , at the end of the day ,
all i want to do is milk this place for all it &apos;s worth
while it &apos;s still standing .
i &apos;ve reconsidered .
you &apos;re right .
a rising tide lifts all boats .
i &apos;ll support alicia &apos;s elevation to name partner .
on what condition ?
one that i think you &apos;ll be happy to comply with .
hello ?
did you eat ?
no .
you want something ?
no .
what we have here is a political hot potato
masquerading as a legal case .
the law has simply not caught up with technology ,
and drones remain-- and i would suggest frighteningly--
unregulated .
but because any regulation would require hard choices
between the competing values of privacy , individual liberty ,
and commerce , neither the legislative
or the executive branch of the united states
want to make a decision , so it falls to me .
i &apos;m not thrilled to say this , but ...
drones are not on private property above 83 feet .
and you , dr. nachmann ,
owe the plaintiff punitive and compensatory damages . that &apos;s it .
well fought .
thank you .
your husband is a lawyer , too , right ?
yes .
how does that work ?
not well .
we &apos;re separated .
oh , my god . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
yes .
he &apos;s in las vegas .
it &apos;s just zoe and me .
i guess you were right .
i never should &apos;ve left .
no .
i wasn &apos;t right .
you threw in with diane .
i &apos;ll call you back .
it &apos;s just what &apos;s best for the firm .
isn &apos;t that what you told me when i got sent downstairs ?
you let diane and alicia take over and what ?
they slip you a few extra shares to shut up and smile ?
something like that .
life &apos;s a bitch , kid .
assistant u.s. attorney fox .
diane lockhart . i &apos;m representing eli gold .
what can i do for you ?
my client is here to confess to obstruction of justice
in the don schakowsky bribery case .
you realize that potentially comes with it a ...
lengthy prison term .
i do .
given mr. gold &apos;s willingness to cooperate ,
his daughter marissa should be of no further interest to you .
of course , if you wish to pursue these charges ,
mr. gold won &apos;t be of much value as a witness in any future trials ,
including , perhaps , peter florrick &apos;s .
uh , my understanding was that your client doesn &apos;t know anything about
governor florrick &apos;s involvement in the locke mistrial .
my memory on that point is ... foggy .
i suppose it could be refreshed .
only time will tell .
so , um , you tell us , mr. fox .
would you like to hear mr. gold &apos;s confession ?
or would you rather wait and hear his testimony at trial ?
thank you .
for what ?
for making me a name partner . it was a surprise .
don &apos;t thank me . i voted against it .
is that because of the conversation we had before ?
no . don &apos;t worry . david lee voted for you .
he doesn &apos;t care anymore .
cary ... i &apos;m on your side .
i know we &apos;ve been at loggerheads before ,
but i won &apos;t be working against you .
i know . because i &apos;m quitting .
what ?
i &apos;m having diane buy me out .
she ...
why ?
i don &apos;t like it anymore .
i like being a lawyer .
that can be fun . but this isn &apos;t .
i &apos;m not good at it .
i &apos;m not good at looking over my shoulder .
i don &apos;t want to be my dad .
cary , you can &apos;t just quit .
yeah , i can .
by the way , i was subpoenaed in your husband &apos;s case .
it &apos;s not good .
can i come in ?
i can &apos;t fight now , peter .
i &apos;m exhausted .
then let me just talk .
i &apos;m not here to argue you out of your divorce .
the kids are grown .
we live apart . things have changed .
good . thanks .
but i do need to ask you a favor .
as you know , i &apos;m being indicted .
but this time , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a false alarm .
i need you to stand beside me during this .
you can proceed with the divorce .
just get everything ready . i won &apos;t contest it .
but ...
don &apos;t make it public until afterwards .
i can &apos;t have it look like you &apos;re leaving me because i &apos;m guilty .
after that , we &apos;ll go our separate ways .
live our lives .
see each other when the kids graduate .
but i need to ask you this one last favor .
