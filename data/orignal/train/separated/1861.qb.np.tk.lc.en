no , i just wanna say ,
i &apos;m really excited about the clinical trial .
i &apos;ve been reading the &lt; i &gt; new england journal of medicine &lt; / i &gt; .
germs . disease . toxins ...
our bodies encounter dangers all the time .
just beneath the surface .
hidden .
whether you realize it or not ,
your body is constantly protecting itself .
i &apos;d like to propose a toast .
why is the sperm donor here ?
i thought tonight was a family dinner .
dad , i ...
to two extraordinary women ,
may your lives be overfilled with love , happiness , and joy .
to callie and arizona ,
the mothers of my child .
oh , for god &apos;s sake , i ...
oh , daniel . cheers .
cheers . cheers .
yes . there we go .
do you ever go by anything other than colonel ,
colonel ?
the colonel .
actually , um ... we forgot to say grace .
say what ?
yeah , we should-- we should say grace before we eat .
of course . shame on us .
fork down , the colonel .
mom , you want to lead ?
bless us , oh , lord , and these thy gifts ...
every time you blink your eye ,
you wash away thousands of unwanted microbes .
breathe in too much unwanted pollen and you sneeze .
amen .
okay . i &apos;ll go . i &apos;ll go get her . excuse me .
arizona , we sat next to a charming young man
on the plane today ,
and he said he was going with his partner
to march in a parade .
for pride ?
yeah . those are good .
the body knows when it &apos;s encountered something that doesn &apos;t belong .
oh . she couldn &apos;t be cuter if she tried .
mom , you haven &apos;t had a chance to hold her yet .
the body detects the invader ,
it releases its white blood cells ...
no , no , that &apos;s all right . thank you , though .
i &apos;m eating .
and it attacks .
this is zola . she &apos;s 6 months old ,
born with spina bifida ...
adorable african children .
shameless ego stroking ...
karev is a genius .
yeah , he &apos;s single @-@ handedly stealing chief resident
out from under all of us ,
and we &apos;re helping him do it .
i mean , we can &apos;t exactly refuse to treat little sick kids
without making ourselves look bad .
oh , he is a genius .
or ...
that &apos;s what they say in swahili .
... spine to prevent any further brain damage ...
well , he only has a shot because i &apos;ve been benched .
the playing field has been leveled . you &apos;re all welcome .
my alzheimer &apos;s trial kicks african @-@ orphan ass .
it kicks all of your asses .
do you want to keep it down back there ?
i &apos;m trying to listen to what appears to be
the next chief resident talking .
before we go , i just want to say thank you
to all of you for your participation .
it , uh , truly means more than i could say .
slow clap . they &apos;re giving him the slow clap . come on .
i &apos;m not giving him the slow clap .
okay , i want to personally check the incision sites ,
any weight fluctuations ,
the patients &apos; glucose levels .
when was the last time you cleaned these cages , avery ?
a clean cage means a lower infection rate ,
which means f.d.a. approval ,
understood ?
cages . i got it , sir .
makena ? hi , i &apos;m dr. shepherd .
of course , you know dr. karev .
we &apos;re here to take a look at zola today .
uh , sometimes babies with spina bifida
can develop chiari malformation .
it causes fluid build @-@ up in the brain .
it could be pretty uncomfortable , but sometimes ,
if you adjust the patient &apos;s head position--
it helps relieve the pressure .
let me see this . let me see this face .
we &apos;ve had her at the orphanage
since she was 2 months old .
this is the first time she &apos;s stopped crying
since i can remember .
let &apos;s just run an m.r.i.
and check to see if she has a chiari malformation
or hydrocephalus .
if it &apos;s positive , we &apos;re gonna have to do a shunt .
drain the fluid .
it &apos;s gonna postpone the spinal surgery ,
but i think it &apos;s gonna be worth it .
i think she likes you .
she can keep that lamplight .
sefu , i will be repairing
your brother &apos;s heart defect tomorrow while dr. sloan ,
our head of plastics ,
he will construct kondo a new sternum .
he wants to know , if he dies ,
could we wait to tell the family at home .
our sister &apos;s birthday is tomorrow ,
and he doesn &apos;t want to ruin it .
we are gonna take really good care of you . okay ?
and you are not gonna ruin your sister &apos;s birthday .
we have to look at his chest . okay ?
sir .
get off me ! i told you that i &apos;m fine !
i don &apos;t need any help .
sir , please .
sir , if you continue to try to get out of bed ,
i &apos;m gonna have to restrain you .
get off me . get off--aah !
b @-@ 52 cocktail .
ought to calm him down .
okay , listen , i need to get back
in the race for chief resident .
i need in on teddy &apos;s pentalogy of cantrell patient .
this isn &apos;t funny anymore . she is still shutting me out .
can &apos;t you talk to her ?
i thought you were on robbins &apos; service today .
isn &apos;t she on that case , too ?
yeah , but that just puts me ,
like , inches away from some other resident
doing the most amazing cardio procedure imaginable
while i just stand there and ...
suction . it &apos;s torture .
you need to apologize .
apologize for what ?
for having better judgment than teddy ?
for saving callie &apos;s life ?
there &apos;s a wedding tomorrow because of me .
your apology could use some work .
you asked me how to get back in with teddy .
i &apos;m telling you how .
asha is 10 years old . she sustained internal injuries
six years ago from an explosive device .
she has multiple enterotomies .
and there are some strictures there
and some ascites .
she has not healed properly .
boy , this complicates things .
as does the fact that she &apos;s h.i.v. positive .
she &apos;s living with a.i.d.s ..
hello .
uh , don &apos;t be scared .
i &apos;m just gonna take your blood pressure now , okay ?
mm . so--oh , no . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
um , we &apos;re-- we &apos;re here to help .
help .
let &apos;s get her on l.r. at maintenance
and start broad spectrum antibiotics .
understand ?
help . help .
dr. kepner ...
um , the antibiotics and the l.r. ?
oh , right . sorry , dr. hunt . right away .
you know , dr. kepner .
yeah .
perhaps if you spent a little more time just doing your job ,
a little less time learning the new languages ,
your attendings wouldn &apos;t have to repeat themselves .
hold , please .
dr. altman , i would like to apologize .
i am ... sorry
for going over your head
and putting you in a difficult position
during callie &apos;s surgery .
i am sorry . i @-@ i apologize .
are you saying this because you mean it
or because you want back on my service ?
does it really matter ?
yes , it matters .
here you go .
thank you .
i , uh , i put together a schedule to , uh ,
to help with the next two days .
ah . oh , by the hour , military time--wow .
thank you , colonel .
and i picked up a little something for sofia .
look at the little rosebuds .
okay , mom , baby clothes later .
wedding rehearsal now . i &apos;ve got 20 minutes
before i have to get back to the hospital .
dad , where &apos;s the moment of silence ?
time is tight , arizona .
i could not find a place in the ceremony for it .
well , we have to light a candle for timothy .
it &apos;s two minutes .
timothy ?
oh , her brother .
dad ...
sweetie , don &apos;t push it .
okay , so the table is the altar ,
and the lamp is ...
father brooks .
your priest ?
minister .
no , he &apos;s not catholic ,
but he practices at a very big church .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s old and drafty . it &apos;s--you &apos;ll like it .
it &apos;s very churchy .
i see .
okay , mrs. torres , you &apos;ll be over here in the front row .
okay , and i know where you want me .
right back here to walk my little girl down the aisle .
sorry .
sorry . surgery ran long , but i &apos;m here .
i made it . where do you want me ?
that is not where you will be .
oh , this is your spot ? sorry .
hey , mark .
why don &apos;t you stand over here next to me ?
at least one of my fathers @-@ in @-@ law doesn &apos;t hate me .
you &apos;re sofia &apos;s father .
i love sofia , so i &apos;m gonna at least try to like you .
but if you call me your father @-@ in @-@ law again ,
i &apos;ll knock you out .
okay .
so arizona walks down the aisle first .
there she goes .
all right . and then i go .
and then i hand the bouquet to--
mom ... can i hand you the bouquet ?
actually , i , um , i @-@ i need to use the powder room .
excuse me .
well , i &apos;d like some bouquet time if you don &apos;t mind .
i haven &apos;t had enough bouquet time today .
i mean , you &apos;d think being on the chief &apos;s research project
would help in the race for chief resident .
you might even think it &apos;d make me a contender .
only i &apos;m not saving little kids or people with alzheimer &apos;s .
i &apos;m cleaning up mouse poop .
can you hand me that basin ?
wanna hear my conversation with the chief every morning ?
&quot; avery , how are the mice ? &quot;
&quot; oh , they &apos;re fine , chief .
they &apos;re running on their wheels .
they &apos;re eating their cheese . &quot;
if i worked at a pet store ,
i &apos;d be employee of the month by now .
but i &apos;m a surgeon ,
babysitting a bunch of mice .
until you get f.d.a. approval ,
okay , which , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re gonna be
working on humans any day now .
now grab me another plum .
why are you peeling these things apart anyway ?
i &apos;m practicing .
since my kid &apos;s skin
has grown directly onto the heart muscle ,
i &apos;m gonna be helping teddy remove the adhesions
without puncturing the heart .
hey ! don &apos;t eat my adhesions .
oh , gross .
okay , okay , look , i need 20 good reasons
why i shouldn &apos;t let cristina back on my service today ,
because i am ready to buckle .
i have got a really complicated case ,
and i could use her skills today ,
so 20 reasons , right now , please .
i don &apos;t have one reason .
ugh . i think you should put her back on your service .
no . no .
that would be the worst thing that i could do .
i mean , that j--that won &apos;t teach her a thing .
she went over your head in a surgery .
yes , that was bad form ,
but don &apos;t you think you &apos;re being a little bit harsh ?
harsh ?
okay , first of all , she went over my head to you ,
and you enabled that behavior ,
which you really shouldn &apos;t have done .
but more importantly is ,
cristina is dangerous right now .
she got lucky . callie survived that procedure ,
but it just as easily could &apos;ve been disastrous .
cristina got lucky .
she doesn &apos;t see it that way .
she thinks she &apos;s right .
she always thinks she &apos;s right .
and that is not being a good doctor .
that is dangerous .
tell her that .
instead of just shutting her out , tell her that .
there &apos;s no telling cristina yang anything .
she has to learn it .
and until then , i am okay being the bad guy .
i can handle her being angry at me .
do you really think that she can handle something
like killing callie torres ?
so zola doesn &apos;t have a chiari malformation ,
but she does have hydrocephalus .
okay .
let &apos;s book an o.r. for the shunt right away , okay ?
hey , what do you got for me ? any news ?
ugh . i went over all the screening tests ,
but you need to start looking at
the next wave of patient charts .
next wave ?
the alzheimer &apos;s trial .
the first wave of the trial is done .
now we &apos;re getting ready to treat the next group .
let me know when the o.r. is booked .
mer , what &apos;s going on ? does he know what you did ?
what did i do ?
i saw you with the clinical trial envelope .
you were hiding it under your lab coat .
look , if you messed with this trial somehow ,
this could be bad for you-- like , really bad .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
whatever you did , no matter how minor ,
it invalidates the entire project .
alex--
you could get into real trouble here , mer .
it &apos;s illegal to mess around with a blind trial .
i didn &apos;t do anything ! so shut up about it .
dr. stark , can i talk to you ?
well , it appears you already are .
i @-@ i have some concerns about asha .
she hasn &apos;t eaten a bite of food since she arrived .
all right . start her on parenteral nutrition .
i will , obviously , but more to the point ,
the fact that she &apos;s not eating , not speaking ...
kepner .
she just seems really scared , and i ...
you know ,
unless the next piece of information from your mouth
relies on the words , uh , &quot; lab results &quot; or &quot; vitals &quot;
or &quot; code blue , &quot; i don &apos;t care .
you promised .
you promised me that we could work together ,
that it wouldn &apos;t be weird ,
that you would treat me like any other resident .
i assure you , i am treating you
exactly the way i treat other residents .
it &apos;s a 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 on asha .
asha , what &apos;s wrong ?
okay , what happened ?
her blood pressure dropped out .
her pulse was thready .
somebody notify hunt .
help .
okay , get me four units of packed cells ...
draw a new c.b.c. , coags , open up her fluids .
kepner , get a gown .
i &apos;m fine .
i need a central line kit right now .
kepner .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;ve got this .
two more days .
we can handle two more days .
and then they &apos;ll be gone ,
and our lives will go back to normal .
no more brunches . no more praying .
no more of my dad calling himself the colonel .
we just need to focus on ...
the big picture ...
yeah .
which is ...
you and i ...
are getting married .
we &apos;re getting married .
we &apos;re getting married .
we couldn &apos;t stop the bleeding ,
so we rushed her here .
oh , what the hell ?
it looks like wax .
i have never seen anything like this .
nobody has , at least not in the states .
she has intestinal t.b. poor kid .
there &apos;s adhesions everywhere .
it &apos;s hard to even know where to begin .
the perforation &apos;s pretty high at the lesser curvature .
we should treat it like a normal perf , right ?
and then start the anti @-@ t.b. meds ?
the less aggressive we are ,
the greater chance we can avoid
short gut syndrome .
引起的吸收不良和营养不良
absolutely right , kepner .
let &apos;s start by ligating the bleeding vessel .
the trick is to go in very slowly
until you feel a little give ,
and then you should see some fluid .
got it .
very nice . you know , i wasn &apos;t exactly pleased
when you decided to bow out of the trial .
yeah , well--
but the work you &apos;re doing with the kids
is really impressive .
thank you .
and you were right about meredith being the right person
for the alzheimer &apos;s trial all along .
i &apos;m impressed . you are remarkably calm
for a bride who &apos;s getting married tomorrow .
well , you should see the schedule
that my dad put together .
i just show up where i belong , when i belong . it &apos;s perfect .
everyone should get married like this .
who is that from , hottie husband or hottie boyfriend ?
it &apos;s from andrew , who is not my boyfriend .
he &apos;s just , uh , he &apos;s just my wedding date .
uh @-@ huh , and does your hottie wedding date
know about your hottie husband ?
well , there &apos;s nothing to know .
i mean , andrew will be in town for another week ,
and then he &apos;s off to who knows where .
so i &apos;m just enjoying what he has to offer while he &apos;s offering .
appropriate urinary output , normal weight reading ,
and ... running on the wheel .
patient h. , you &apos;re looking great .
very good .
patient i. , what can i say ?
appropriate urinary output .
i cannot believe i am talking to mice like they &apos;re--oh , no .
no , no , no . mouse j.
mouse j.
okay , so just pretend my hoodie &apos;s a gown . okay ?
and ...
open your eyes .
what do you think ?
i had it made to look like yours .
i @-@ i can see that .
i have loved this picture since i was a little girl ,
and i just wanted to surprise you .
i ... it &apos;s--do you like it ?
okay , what , mom ?
what don &apos;t you like ?
well , n @-@ nothing , nothing . it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s lovely .
lovely .
that &apos;s ... it ?
what else would you like me to say ?
i don &apos;t know . something .
i mean , i &apos;ve been bending over backwards
since you first got here just to make you feel comfortable .
i didn &apos;t ask you to do anything for me .
i &apos;m getting married in a church for you .
don &apos;t you dare imply that there &apos;s anything
about a wedding to a woman or ...
a baby out of wedlock that &apos;s for me .
okay .
so what bothers you more , my bastard child
or my lesbian fiance ?
you &apos;re a lawyer , mom .
you &apos;re out in the world . you know other gay people .
your secretary &apos;s gay .
i &apos;m your daughter .
do you know how devastating it is
to raise a child and to love a child
and know you won &apos;t see that child in heaven ?
认为同性恋死后不能上天堂
oh , mom .
you are not a bride .
and i am not the mother of a bride .
and this ...
this--this isn &apos;t your wedding .
it isn &apos;t right .
i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t be here . i just can &apos;t .
sefu ...
didn &apos;t they get you a cot
so you could stay with your brother tonight ?
i can &apos;t sleep .
back home ...
i have all of these sisters ,
but kondo ...
he &apos;s my only brother .
and ...
i don &apos;t want to lose him .
i know you don &apos;t .
i know .
you &apos;ve apparently stopped answering your pages
in order to , what , join the kitchen staff ?
i need those post @-@ op reports .
wet @-@ to @-@ dry dressing applied in 18 @-@ 10 .
vitals stable in your crohn &apos;s patient , post @-@ op .
you were exposed to hiv positive blood .
i suppose you &apos;ve checked yourself for cuts .
i &apos;m a doctor .
we get exposed to things all the time .
i know proper protocol .
and the sticky yellow mess here ,
this took priority over reporting back to me because--
this sticky yellow mess is nsima .
it &apos;s a maize porridge ,
which happens to be a staple
in most east @-@ african countries .
i found the recipe online .
i &apos;m not sure why asha hasn &apos;t eaten in two days ,
but i am sure that she &apos;s not used to eating
processed american food .
i don &apos;t expect you to care ,
but when she is ready to eat after surgery ,
she &apos;s gonna be hungry ,
and she &apos;s used to corn porridge .
so while i can &apos;t make her talk ,
i can &apos;t do anything about the fact that she is sick ,
that she has advanced tb ,
that she is a 10 year old living with aids .
i can do this .
i can make my patient something she might eat .
so unless you have more insults for me , dr. stark ,
i &apos;m a little busy now making porridge .
i @-@ i tried to reason with her .
she won &apos;t listen .
she &apos;s just sitting downstairs in the car .
i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t know what to say , sweetheart .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m so sorry .
daddy , you need to go . okay ?
go ? i @-@ i can &apos;t-- i &apos;m not leaving--
you have to go , okay , because if you don &apos;t ,
i will start crying ,
and then that will make you feel bad ,
and then i will feel worse , so you ...
have to go .
okay ?
okay .
is there any milk over there ?
alex , is there any more milk ?
so you &apos;re not talking to me now , is that it ?
you told me to shut up ,
so i &apos;m just gonna sit here and read the cereal box
and practice keeping my mouth shut .
i didn &apos;t change any data or falsify any results .
or switch a syringe so some sweet , sad old lady
would get the drug and not the placebo ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
nothing i did will change any results .
it doesn &apos;t change the potential effectiveness of the drug .
it doesn &apos;t change anything .
except the life of the guy
who was supposed to get the drug and now won &apos;t .
look , the truth will come out ,
when the f.d.a. investigates ,
they &apos;ll invalidate seattle grace
as a research institution .
that blacklist is you , derek ,
every fricking doctor in this hospital .
this is bigger than you .
it messes with me . it messes with everyone .
i mean , i &apos;m a lot of things , but i &apos;m not a liar .
i never thought you were , either .
so what are you saying , you &apos;re gonna tell ?
morning .
i &apos;m late for work .
okay .
all right .
oh , good . can i borrow something ?
it can be anything , really--
a handkerchief , tissue , cash .
i &apos;ve got something old , new , blue .
i just need something borrowed .
i just got a call from father brooks .
his wife got into an accident .
oh . she &apos;s okay , but , uh , they &apos;re in the er now .
he &apos;s not gonna make it to the wedding .
you &apos;re kidding .
please tell me you &apos;re kidding .
do you know how hard it was
to find a minister willing to marry us ?
well , he left me some numbers .
we can call for a replacement--
no , no , no . you know what ? don &apos;t make any calls .
don &apos;t get anyone .
just ... forget it .
i &apos;m not getting married .
let &apos;s go .
mouse j. here took a turn for the worse last night .
i did an x @-@ ray .
it didn &apos;t show anything ,
so i did a ct .
you did an x @-@ ray and a ct on a mouse ?
i mean , if there &apos;s anything in this ct .
i can &apos;t make it out .
i couldn &apos;t either ,
which is why i did an mri .
you did a ct and an mri ?
avery , you have $ 8,000 worth of scans right here
for a rodent .
yes , sir , i understand that ,
but if you just look at the mri .
just look .
what do you see ?
i see a @-@ a little hernia .
and the portal vein &apos;s not draining very well .
which means the problem isn &apos;t
the way the device functions .
it &apos;s where the device functions .
we just need to put it closer to the surface ,
just underneath the skin .
let &apos;s get started .
you paged ?
yeah . zola , this is meredith .
meredith , this is zola .
here , can you hold her for a minute ?
uh , sure . come here .
there . okay .
zola , can you smile for me ?
yeah . see ? her facial movements are intact .
okay , look . over here . see that ?
watch how she &apos;s tracking me . over here .
neuro exam is good , even after the shunt .
great . did something happen ? why did you page ?
i need to ask you something , okay ?
okay .
can you excuse us for a minute ?
yes , doctor .
i need you to be completely honest with me . okay ?
if alex said something to you--
let &apos;s adopt this baby .
what ? are you serious ?
yeah .
you know , i was holding her yesterday ,
and she was crying , and then she stopped .
and i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve held a lot of babies .
i &apos;ve fixed a lot of babies , but i looked down at zola--
i don &apos;t know what it was . i just--
i just couldn &apos;t imagine her being with any other parent
or any other family .
we &apos;ve been trying so hard to start a family ,
and--and she needs one .
let &apos;s adopt her . i &apos;m serious .
let &apos;s adopt her .
you realize your door is unlocked ?
i could be anyone .
i could be ... a burglar coming to burgle you .
where is the baby ?
i could be a baby @-@ napper trying to baby @-@ nap you .
i know why they sent you .
and it doesn &apos;t matter what you say .
the wedding &apos;s still off .
my mom &apos;s right .
it &apos;s a joke .
it &apos;s not a wedding and it &apos;s not happening .
oh , callie .
i can &apos;t have a priest .
i no longer have a minister .
i &apos;m not being given away by my dad .
the wedding isn &apos;t legal .
what &apos;s the point ?
this isn &apos;t a wedding . it &apos;s not even in a church .
it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s a couple of girls playing dress up .
it &apos;s not real .
it &apos;s not real .
j--okay .
first of all , you do not need the law
or a priest or your mother to make your wedding real .
and--and the church is ...
the church can be anywhere you want it to be--
i @-@ in a field ... on a mountain ,
right here in this room ,
anywhere--because where do you think god is ?
come on . he &apos;s in you .
he &apos;s in me .
just right here , in the middle of us .
now your--your church just hasn &apos;t caught up to god yet .
your mother ...
she hasn &apos;t caught up to god yet .
and by the way ...
she may not ever catch up ,
but it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
if you are willing to stand up
in front of your friends and family and god
and commit yourself ...
to another human being ,
to--to give of yourself in that kind of partnership ,
for better or worse , in sickness and health ,
honey , that is a marriage .
that is real ,
and that &apos;s all that matters .
besides ...
girl , i got legally married to a man in a church .
look how well that turned out .
you ready for me yet ?
just about .
okay , grey , time to repair the v.s.d. ,
through the diverticulum .
can i have a little suction here , please ?
thank you .
all right , there &apos;s a small defect
at the neck of the diverticulum .
grey , pull up on your pickups so i can get in there .
hold the graft .
are you gonna use an 11 @-@ blade to make the incision ?
no , she &apos;s going in blind .
5 @-@ 0 suture .
all right . i &apos;m sewing in the graft .
grey , would you like to tie off when i finish ?
y @-@ yes . yes .
we addressed all the strictures and adhesions
without sacrificing much of the intestines at all .
hell of a save .
so , dr. hunt ,
i understand you &apos;ve been put in charge
of determining the next chief resident .
with input from all of the attendings obviously .
all right . well , in that case ,
i &apos;d like to talk to you about april kepner .
i think if you check my file , you &apos;ll see that i rarely give
formal feedback about my residents .
when i do , it is almost exclusively negative .
that said ,
i &apos;d very much like to recommend april kepner
for the chief resident position .
she goes above and beyond for her patients
even when she isn &apos;t asked .
well , especially when she isn &apos;t asked .
she sees the patient as a whole ,
not just as a set of symptoms .
i &apos;ll tell you , that kind of caring , that can &apos;t be taught .
so i think this hospital would be lucky to have her
as the next chief resident .
hmm . well , thank you , dr. stark . yeah .

look at this list--
blood work , financial statements ,
a home study , i mean , fire alarms .

you &apos;re not the only contenders , you know ?

i wanted to take a piece to adele .
oh , i have no idea , sir .
you know , it &apos;s funny how things work out .
karev stepped up .
jackson &apos;s starting to shine .
there &apos;s kepner , grey .
i always assumed that you would be
the front @-@ runner for chief resident , yang .
but , uh , it just goes to show--
you can &apos;t count anyone out .
i &apos;m gonna check on that cake .
you want a real apology ?
can &apos;t this wait till work tomorrow ?
&apos;cause my date &apos;s waiting for me .
you know , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m such an exceptional surgeon
that it threatens you .
i &apos;m sorry my surgical repair saved
callie &apos;s life and yours didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry your ego is so fragile
that i had to stand on the sidelines of a surgery
i should have been performing with you today ,
like i have been standing on the sidelines
for the past three months ,
basically ruining my chances for chief resident .
you want sincerity ?
i could not be more sincere .
and yet ...
you still don &apos;t get it .
my glass is empty again .
i , uh , i have a proposition for you .
mm . i like the sound of that .
i &apos;ve been offered a position at landstuhl medical center .
in germany ? wow .
uh , wow . that &apos;s , uh ...
that &apos;s an amazing facility .
the position they offered me is permanent .
so i accepted on one condition .
that they find an opening for my incredibly talented
cardiothoracic surgeon girlfriend .
andrew--
i live a nomadic life .
and it &apos;s never bothered me till now .
i want to settle down .
i want to start a life with someone ,
and i &apos;m hoping that that someone is you .
just when we think we &apos;ve figured things out ...
the universe throws us a curveball .
all right , it &apos;s now time to clear the dance floor
and make way for the father @-@ daughter dance , folks .
oh , crap . i forgot to take that off the schedule .
