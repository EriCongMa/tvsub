lesli ? what are you doing in rosewood ?
you mention my name to anyone ever again
&apos;and you &apos;ll live to regret it.&apos;
we went to a junkyard to take some pictures
and i &apos;m sure a followed us there .
clark may have taken a picture of a.
&apos;so borrow them.&apos;
we &apos;re all good .
&apos;i read the text you got . from aria.&apos;
you &apos;ve been looking all along , haven &apos;t you ?
what ?
for whoever had us down in that bunker .
i &apos;ve been trying to protect you .
if a few bites of a cookie can get me through my day
and help me sleep ..
doesn &apos;t work like that .
why were you stealing your file , mona ?
she was stealing lesli stone &apos;s .
lesli stone was in radley ?
long enough to know mona , and charles .
what about sara ?
i mean , why would lesli stone go after a stranger ?
it was probably just a rehearsal , em .
until she could get her hands on the real alison .
okay , so what do we do now ?
i say we catch her in the act .
lesli stone ? that &apos;s crazy .
that &apos;s what i said . but maybe it &apos;s not .
okay , wait . you were in a room with this person .
yeah , and they were wearing a mask .
look , mona &apos;s always been shady about how she met this girl .
and now we know why . they were sharing a straitjacket .
spencer--
let &apos;s not forget that mona got a gas mask .
and she was passing out juice @-@ boxes while the rest of us
were making sure that we still had kidneys !
what &apos;s takin &apos; hanna so long ?
i don &apos;t know , she probably has to drag mona here on a leash .
oh , spencer , we saw a jump off a building .
a set up an underground bunker
with more spy equipment than the cia .
i mean , seriously , in your heart
do you believe that lesli stone could--
people can surprise you .
mona maintained a 4.0 average and perfect hair
while she was tapping rosewood &apos;s police calls .
spencer , we jumped on the andrew train--
but he didn &apos;t have a motive .
this girl does . she thinks that we killed bethany !
i can &apos;t get to her .
why ?
did mona skip town ?
mona &apos;s mom busted her for sneaking out to radley .
she &apos;s totally unplugged .
mona &apos;s not even allowed to leave her room .
doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m not even sure mona would be of any help anyways .
now you tell me ?
after i tried to shimmy up her drainpipe ?
okay , well , i have to go .
my mom made an appointment for me and her with dr. sullivan ,
i can &apos;t be late .
where &apos;s aria ?
she &apos;s up at hollis ,
she &apos;s sneaking clark &apos;s negatives back into that cubby .
okay , so what &apos;s the plan ?
are we gonna track down lesli stone ?
are we gonna go to philly ?
i have to get my head shrunk .
seriously ?
wait , what is wrong with you people ?
a is still out there , we have to stick together
and see if we can try and catch this girl in the act .
did you see who put this on my car ?
this card .
did you see who put it under the wiper ?
have you see anybody outside of my house in the last hour ?
yes or no ?
no .
mornin .
hey .
um , i @-@ i was just--
looking for somethin &apos; ?
uh , i was hoping it was a bagel and cream cheese in there .
listen , here &apos;s the thing--
i &apos;m not mad .
uh , if you were that uncomfortable with me
taking photos of you , you could &apos;ve just said so .
you didn &apos;t have to go all klepto .
so what &apos;s next for the morning bandit ?
wanna grab that bagel for real ?
i can &apos;t , um , but i ... i will owe you one .
okay ?
i really appreciate it .
thanks . have a nice day .
hey , caleb .
hey , hope it &apos;s not early .
no , not at all , come on in .
i was just about to make some breakfast .
what .. what is this lump back here ?
i don &apos;t know . lint . i just woke up .
caleb , how would you like your eggs ?
um , mom , i can &apos;t eat breakfast .
i have to go meet spencer .
um , can i give you a lift ?
no , i &apos;m good .
wait .
where are you girls going ?
spencer has an appointment in philly .
and we &apos;re using the buddy system just like you asked us to .
i &apos;ll call you later .
hey , em ? which one should i wear to caleb &apos;s office ?
um , your office is where caleb plays
grand theft auto in his boxers .
i just don &apos;t wanna screw up on my first day .
everyone screws up on their first day .
that &apos;s what makes it a first day .
do you still like it ? or did i make a mistake ?
no . no , no , no . that looks great , yeah .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s gonna have to wear long johns
in august so no one sees my courage .
um , do you want me to help you with that ?
yeah .
here . you should wear this one .
thanks .
good luck .
uh , did we--
oh , no , no , no .
i @-@ i was just in the &apos; hood
and i wanted to drop something off .
can i come in ?
yeah , sure . come on .
what &apos;s that ?
my sponsor gave it to me . years ago .
uh , the guy who wrote it , went through some heavy stuff .
alright , if you hate it ,
might put you to sleep .
have you ..
what ?
been sleeping , without help ?
um , no . not really .
uh , but my friend is waiting for me in philly .
so ..
oh , right , um ..
sorry .
there &apos;s one more thing .
this way you don &apos;t have to wrestle anyone
to the ground for the last brownie .
oh , my god .
thank you .
um , sorry .
what &apos;s wrong ?
my sister in london is texting me .
my mother &apos;s enlisting allies in the war over commencement .
you thinkin &apos; of skippin &apos; it ?
no , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s not about going , it &apos;s about speaking .
my principal asked me to stand up in front entire school
and be the poster girl for trauma .
i &apos;m just really not that into it .
why you so sure ?
well , why else would he ask me to be valedictorian ?
i mean , i have incompletes in every subject except for lunch .
and everybody expects me to stand up
and give some really moving speech about being a survivor .
and i &apos;m not ready to talk about it as if it &apos;s over .
when it &apos;s not ... over .
so don &apos;t do it .
what ?
just say no .
uh , considering everything you &apos;ve been through
i think walking across that stage and accepting a diploma
is a pretty impressive accomplishment .
did your mom recruit another relative ?
no , that &apos;s hanna . i really have to go .
uh , but i &apos;ll see you at the meeting later ?
you bet .
okay .
thank you ... for those .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
where are you ?
on the road , i got held up .
well , she just raced into her faculty lunch , late .
i mean , where was she ? stuck at that junkyard ?
wait , why were you held up ?
dean stopped by , with a gift .
dean ? drug @-@ free dean ? why was he giving you gifts ?
because we &apos;re friends .
wow . toby better hurry back to rosewood .
will you stop ? what are we doing when i get there ?
stop asking questions . just drive faster . hurry up .
okay , so the first thing you &apos;re gonna learn
to build is a cms interface .
i promise it &apos;s not as complicated as i just made it sound .
these days everyone wants a responsive design
that adjusts itself to different screens .
so the photo of ... kimye will look the same
on your phone , your smart pad , and your computer .
what &apos;s kimye ?
kanye and kim ?
yeah , right . you wouldn &apos;t , uh ..
you &apos;ve been ..
you know what actually ? you don &apos;t even need to know .
no one does .
hey , i &apos;m sorry . that ...
that whole kimye thing was just joke .
i &apos;ve got a lot of catching up to do .
it &apos;s exhausting being on the outside all the time .
yeah .
well , at least you , uh , you have the other girls to connect with .
what do you know about alison dilaurentis ?
i wouldn &apos;t ask , but ..
when you &apos;re forced to answer to someone else &apos;s name
and wear their clothes ...
you become curious about her .
why haven &apos;t you talked to emily ?
i &apos;ve tried , but every time i bring her up ,
emily shuts down .
do you think alison knows who did this to us ?
well , if she does , that person &apos;s not long for this world .
look , i &apos;m sorry . i wish i had more answers for you , but ..
the truth is , i &apos;m on the outside looking in too .
i hate it .
hi , there .
i &apos;m so embarrassed .
i thought i put my ticket in my bag but i can &apos;t find it .
and now i &apos;m thinking i may have used it to throw away my gum .
um , which one is yours ?
ugh . god , this is so weird .
um , i just got it back from the dealership
and they changed the keychain .
but it &apos;s a dark green range rover . tan interior--
i need the ticket , miss .
have you checked your pockets ?
i thought that i checked everything .
maybe you left it on the table .
oh , come on , you know the car .
it has , like , a harwick bumper sticker on the back .
really nice smell inside . like , cinnamon toast .
seriously ?
you honestly don &apos;t remember me ?
oh , god , that really hurts .
i mean , fine , i &apos;ll just walk back to new jersey .
miss ?
i ... i think i know the car .
ugh . that &apos;s it .
thank god one of us has a brain .
what &apos;s your eta ?
i &apos;m almost there .
okay , well , there &apos;s an alley right when you
turn right on front street , meet me there .
are you stealing her car ?
no , i am borrowing it .
don &apos;t get all preachy with me , puff &apos; n &apos; stuff .
i gotta go .
you saved my life .
love you .
hi , um , does emily fields still work here ?
sorry , i ... heard you talking about emily .
no , she @-@ she doesn &apos;t work here at the moment .
okay .
but i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m ezra fitz , i &apos;m the owner .
i can pass along any ..
wait , wait , wait .
ezra ?
why @-@ why do i know that name ?
i @-@ i feel like emily had a teacher .
yes , that would be me .
i had bit of a career change .
i &apos;m nicole gordon .
hi .
i worked with emily in haiti .
we did that housing program .
oh , yes . that &apos;s right .
she had an amazing summer with you guys .
yeah , that &apos;s what i thought , but then
she changed her e @-@ mail and her number
and never sent me an update .
well , i mean , she had to ..
change everything .
after the trial .
when was the last time you two spoke ?
i &apos;ve been in india the past eight months .
what trial ?
i mean , someone must &apos;ve seen something , right ?
a had to have been trailing us the whole time
and we weren &apos;t the only ones here .
yeah .
there &apos;s a guy that runs this place , but i don &apos;t see him .
em ?
it &apos;s kind of hard to hunt for cloths and pick emojis at the same time .
sorry . i was just checking with sara .
i wanted to see how her first day was going .
well , you two seem to have gotten pretty close .
well , yeah . she &apos;s staying with me .
for how long ?
i told you guys . she has a bad home life .
and we all had things come back to .
people who love us .
i was just wondering what it was like for her down there .
what she was thinkin &apos; about in the dark ..
got her through it .
clark ?
hi . what .. what are you doing here ?
just came back to take some new pictures .
somebody stole mine this morning .
oh , em , this is clark .
the photographer i met at hollis .
nice to meet you .
so what are you doing here ?
when i got home i @-@ i realized i lost my tripod .
i thought i must &apos;ve left it here .
well , let me help you look .
oh , no . that &apos;s fine .
emily offered to help , so ..
hey , a friend of mine is looking for me at the brew .
what friend ?
nicole , from my habitat trip .
i didn &apos;t even know she is on the same hemisphere .
okay , well , do we need to leave right now ?
if you wanna stay and look around
i can drive you home .
great .
yeah , i .. how could i say no ?
what kind of lab did you say lesli worked at ?
i don &apos;t know . it was at a colloge . why ?
this key card could help us get in there .
how fast do you think caleb can make a copy ?
i have no idea .
god , this girl &apos;s such a slob .
she has this hairbrush back here
that smells like a cat box .
well , what &apos;s caleb doing right now ?
why do you keep asking me about caleb ?
why do your shoulders go up every time i say his name ?
are you guys still ...
no , we &apos;re nothing , okay ?
hanna ? don &apos;t lock caleb out .
believe me , i can &apos;t .
my mom keeps letting him in .
i mean , they eat meals together now
because i won &apos;t let him cut my meat .
what is she using this for ?
those are wire cutters .
why does she need to cut wires ?
why does caleb wanna cut your meat ?
because he thinks i &apos;m weak and i &apos;m not .
oh , my god .
she has , like , ten pairs of these grandma glasses in here .
okay , look , i &apos;m gonna text caleb .
no , don &apos;t .
we need his help to copy this .
i &apos;m not gonna tell him why .
oh , my god .
i can see better with these .
i needed glasses this whole time and i never knew it .
let me see .
give me another pair .
there &apos;s no prescription in these .
what ?
they &apos;re clear .
they &apos;re fake . she has multiple pairs of fake glasses .
god , this girl is fooling everyone .
oh , my god .
what ? what &apos;s inside the boxes ?
they &apos;re unassembled cages .
cages ? for what ?
they &apos;re not for gerbils , hanna .
there &apos;s four of them and each one is big enough for ..
what ?
for us .
so have you incinerated those negatives yet ?
not yet .
i mean , i &apos;d understand if you did .
you must feel like you &apos;re under a microscope .
police watching you , parents watching you .
yeah , well , hopefully that &apos;ll all stop soon .
yeah . wait . what ?
what do you mean ?
have they actually caught the guy ?
no , not yet .
but they &apos;re , they &apos;re pretty close .
how do you know ?
sorry . i don &apos;t mean to pry .
you know what ? maybe we should just go .
hey , hold on . this ..
this is where we were the other day .
yeah , yeah . i &apos;ll check over there .
you check back there .
okay .
nicole ?
well , at least you still look like emily .
what are you doing here ?
well , we finished the project .
so i came back to see my dad
and thought i &apos;d make a little detour .
hey , do , either of you want coffee ?
yeah .
i @-@ i &apos;ll do it .
no , no , no . i will get it .
sit . visit .
ezra ... told you , didn &apos;t he ?
don &apos;t be mad at him , please .
no . i @-@ it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;d rather you find out the story from him
than me having to tell it again .
doesn &apos;t your dad live in florida ?
yeah .
all right , so you were more than just a little detour
but , um , i didn &apos;t want to do this over the phone .
thank you .
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
i &apos;m a supervisor now
and i have been asked to put together a team
for an eight week project in thailand .
and i have this crazy idea
of reuniting our caribbean crew .
is that crazy ?
uh , when does it start ?
mid @-@ june .
so basically , you could just fly
there in your cap and gown .
but i &apos;d .. i would want you to change
before you pick up a power tool .
you already made summer plans ?
no .
you @-@ you think it &apos;s a bit far from home ?
no .
you heard they have bugs down there
the size of your head ?
no . yeah , yes .
it &apos;s not that , it &apos;s just ..
i &apos;m still adjusting to being back .
and my mom has me in intensive therapy ..
i &apos;m trying to help a new friend deal with everything and ..
you know what , i ..
... i shouldn &apos;t be throwing this at you right now .
i only brought it up because i remember
when you got off that plane ..
... you were a mess .
but within weeks , you had that ..
... light in your eyes .
helping other people really seemed to ..
it did .
and it @-@ it will again .
you know , there &apos;ll be other trips .
i &apos;m in .
wait , what ?
yeah .
i wanna do this one .
are you sure ?
can i bring a friend ?
you sure you don &apos;t want some coffee or something ?
no , i &apos;m okay . thank you .
um , you said he &apos;ll be back in ..
he &apos;s just pickin &apos; up lunch .
cool .
i know , i should just ask the gym to give me a new card
but they always charge me so much .
你跟你姐谈过了吗
oh , god .
everything okay ?
yeah . it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s just my mom .
can i ask you a question ?
did anybody ..
... ever ask you to talk about it ?
well ..
... my mom keeps asking me to ..
... i guess some reporters offered money .
who &apos;s asking you ?
um , my school , at graduation .
oh , right .
emily told me . you &apos;re the brainiac .
that &apos;s not me .
i wish i had paid more attention at school .
why ?
i mean when i think about how much i used to sweat
homework assignments and exams .
it &apos;s just a bunch of wasted energy .
none of it matters .
i don &apos;t know .
if i could explain
how it felt to be down there
and how it feels to be up here
i &apos;d want everyone to hear it .
hey , you .
hey , hi .
i &apos;m just waiting for an order to ..
... take home and , uh , eat .
you don &apos;t need a book .
i was just killing time .
caleb , we may never know what happened her .
and maybe she &apos;ll tell you or me
or dr. sullivan , but maybe she won &apos;t .
i &apos;m not even trying to force her to , you know .
i &apos;m not trying to smother her .
i know .
i know and i think
on some level ... she knows too .
she just ..
she likes to keep you guessing .
you know ... after her dad and i split up
hanna moved into my bedroom
and we would watch movies late at night .
and she would laugh at the sad parts
and she &apos;d sob at the jokes .
i just feel like i &apos;ve lost her .
i think i saw a glimpse of the hanna we know last night .
she left the freezer door open
and defrosted like $ 80 worth of groceries .
and after i marched upstairs and yelled at her ,
she looked up at me and she was thrilled .
i &apos;m not suggesting you yell at her .
i &apos;m just ..
just remember underneath it all , she is still in there .
it &apos;s not just the junkyard , emily ,
it &apos;s the bottle of hair color in the darkroom ,
the text in sullivan &apos;s office .
i mean , how did a know we were all gonna be there
at the exact same time ?
aria , it &apos;s always been that way .
uh , hello ?
are you there ?
um , em , i @-@ i gotta go ,
ezra &apos;s here .
hi .
hey .
um , so , i was just gonna drop this off
but then i saw your car in the driveway .
you left your application
for the photo competition at the brew .
oh , thank you .
and i @-@ i saw that you needed a recommendation
so i wrote you one .
which i know is @-@ is very presumptuous
and if you want somebody else to write it--
no .
no , i mean ..
who knows me better than you do ?
and you definitely used your creative writing skills .
when .. when did i have a solo exhibit at the brew ?
i might have embellished slightly .
but i mean , i do have your self @-@ portrait
hangin &apos; above my desk .
i did . i mean , i did .
well , i appreciate it .
thank you .
yeah , anytime .
whoa , what is that ?
i did that .
for my photos .
well , that @-@ that certainly is ... disturbing .
not sure if i &apos;d wanna have that
hangin &apos; above my desk .
i meant to call you , i &apos;m so sorry .
where are you going ?
to my car .
look , i @-@ i , i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t make it today .
i just came by to make sure you &apos;re okay , and you are .
see ya .
hold up . can you please let me explain ?
i @-@ i skipped today &apos;s meeting because i ..
i decided that i &apos;m gonna write that speech after all .
i don &apos;t give a crap about the speech .
don &apos;t you get it ?
uh , in my life , when someone doesn &apos;t show up
or answer the phone , there is a very real possibility
that they &apos;re lying in a gutter somewhere .
i didn &apos;t ..
i didn &apos;t realize--
yeah , i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know .
will you at least come inside and have a cup of coffee ?
i can &apos;t see you anymore .
what ?
why ? are you seriously gonna cut me out of your life
because i skipped one meeting ?
no , i need to stop seeing you .
because every time you &apos;re near me , i ..
i just wanna grab you and kiss you .
and the fact that you have a boyfriend isn &apos;t the problem .
the problem is , i don &apos;t care .
hey .
god , caleb .
i &apos;m sorry , i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean to freak you out .
i let myself in . your mom made me a key .
of course , she did .
hanna , knock it off .
knock what off ?
i &apos;m not the one who just shows up
at someone &apos;s door for no reason .
i have a reason .
sara ?
what are you doing ? what happened ?
i will pay for the bike if @-@ if they can &apos;t fix it .
no , what happened to you ?
and if this doesn &apos;t come out
i &apos;ll replace the whole carpet--
hey , sara , stop . talk to me .
how did you get hurt ?
were you in an accident ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know .
you don &apos;t know what ?
if it happened on purpose .
i @-@ i turned onto that street behind the school
and i felt like i was being followed .
by who ?
there was this dark car , it was going real slow .
did the car hit you ?
it suddenly sped up , and ...
the side mirror smashed into my elbow and ..
... i @-@ i have to clean this up before your mom sees it .
no , you don &apos;t . i &apos;ll do it , okay ?
just look at me .
if i show you a picture
can you tell me if it was the same car ?
okay .
look , is this it ?
i think so .
okay , listen to me .
we may have figured out who &apos;s doing this .
who is we ?
sarah , you &apos;re safe in this house , okay ?
a @-@ and in three weeks , you and i can both get outta here .
we &apos;ll get on a plane and--
what ?
a program i did a couple summers ago .
they &apos;re going to thailand .
and my supervisor said that i could take you .
my mother won &apos;t let me leave the country .
what if we talk to your caseworker ?
she can &apos;t help me . no one can .
sara , i can help you , okay ?
i won &apos;t let anything happen to you .
lesli experiments on animals ?
of course she does . what do you think we are to her ?
you guys , less talking , more looking .
which one is her desk ?
umm ... wait , this is it .
alright . what am i supposed to be looking for ?
well , she &apos;s furnished an underground bunker
so i &apos;m guessing she must have a stack of receipts
the size of a phone book .
so , ezra came to my house .
i came really close to telling him .
telling him what ?
about why we &apos;re here . everything .
i hate lying to him .
okay , but you guys aren &apos;tven together anymore
so why do you feel like you owe him ?
no , it &apos;s not about owing him
it &apos;s just who i turn to in times like this
who makes me feel safe .
is that really fair to him ?
what the hell was that ?
spencer , what are you .. what are you doing ?
wait .
why am i beeping ? i haven &apos;t even stolen anything yet .
spencer ! say something ! why are we , like , radioactive ?
bitch chipped us .
she chipped us ?
she friggin &apos; chipped us ?
well , how do we get it out ?
she chipped us in the bunker .
that &apos;s why we were drugged .
yeah , just like every other animal she sicked on us .
birds , snakes , wild horses .
okay , we can stand here and list a &apos;s greatest hits
but we still need something real to give to the police .
so , aria , please keep on checking the desks .
hanna , let &apos;s check these shelves .
why can &apos;t we just hand over our heads ?
hey , um , the copy shop &apos;s printer ran out of ink
so i may have to show you the good pictures on my phone .
i can &apos;t go .
why ? wh @-@ what happened ? did your mom ..
no , i @-@ it &apos;s not my mom .
i ..
the friend i wanted to bring
i can &apos;t leave her behind .
her home situation &apos;s a disaster .
you know , she &apos;s still trying to figure out
how to stand on her own and ..
... and ...
you &apos;re the only thing holding her up .
you know , i &apos;ve only known her for a couple of weeks , but ..
... it &apos;s just been intense .
she &apos;s still trapped in a nightmare .
well , i @-@ i think you all are .
you &apos;re right .
but there are moments when i &apos;m with her
and i completely forget .
you know , it &apos;s like , she &apos;s helping me more than i &apos;m helping her .
em ..
... is sara capable of returning your feelings ?
what ? no , no , no , that @-@ that &apos;s not what i &apos;m feeling .
i &apos;m just ..
i &apos;m sorry , you came all the way out here
and i should &apos;ve waited a day to give you an answer .
well , i @-@ i don &apos;t know about you , but ..
... i &apos;m still really glad i made the trip .

yes , there &apos;s rats too .
and they jump .
do you guys have any food ?
do they eat cheese sticks ?
hey , spencer , not all of them , that &apos;s my dinner .
shut up .
what are you doing ?
what just happened ?
why &apos;d the lights go out ?
have you guys lost your minds ?
mona , you followed us here again ?
why did you turn the lights off ?
so the security guard wouldn &apos;t see us .
us ? oh , save it , mona . you are not one of us .
you &apos;re working for a.
you and lesli stone are going down .
we have what we need and we &apos;re giving it straight to the police .
this college will prosecute .
i &apos;m just trying to save you from yourselves .
cut the crap , mona !
the only thing you &apos;re trying to protect
is lesli &apos;s vendetta against us .
yeah , which is crazy because we had nothing to do
with what happened to bethany !
yeah , we had never even heard of lesli &apos;s friend
until she was found in alison &apos;s grave !
her friend ? where did it say in lesli &apos;s file
that she was friends with bethany young ?
she hated that girl .
oh , really ?
and i suppose she hated charles too ?
so much that she had to start pretending to be him .
lesli is not pretending to be charles .
she &apos;s just pretending to be stable .
that &apos;s why she didn &apos;t want anyone to see that file .
she was in radley the same time as charles .
you &apos;re telling me that lesli never even--
i asked her myself .
she &apos;d only heard charles &apos; name once .
the night that bethany snuck out of radley and never came back .
charles snuck out that night too .
wait . that was the night that alison disappeared .
charles was already dead by then .
not according to lesli .
they were looking for two patients .
the entire place went on lockdown
because of bethany and charles .
he had to be dead , mona . he donated his organs .
show her , spencer .
look .
spencer , why did you just give her those ?
don &apos;t worry , i made copies .
this donation form &apos;s a sham .
look at the medications charles was taking .
nobody would want his liver .
he &apos;s not an eligible donor .
so what are you saying ?
what , that charles is alive ?
of course , and probably planning something big
and wanted to keep us distracted .
lesli &apos;s just easy pickings .
we have a picture .
and the person in the hoodie is not a guy .
spencer , if you caught a in a photo
it &apos;s because a wanted to be caught .
he was a patient there , how could no one know this ?
yeah .. uh , yeah .. thank you ... for your time .
charles chipped all of us .
that &apos;s why it hurts when you press on it .
and you think the person who did this to us
the person who &apos;s after us is charles ?
the dead charles ?
he never was and i knew it .
he tried to make us believe he was dead
because he had to .
i mean , the only reason he gave his name up was because
he thought we &apos;d never get out of that hellhole .
okay , so what was lesli ?
a speed bump . on the way to finding charles .
but we will .
sara , i was just ...
