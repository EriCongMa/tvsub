第五季 第九集
a record heat wave is melting los angeles ,
sparking chaos in stores across the southland .
riot police have been summoned to several locations ...
oh , damn .
this heat is untenable .
it &apos;s like a jewfro apocalypse in here .
i look like a &apos; 70s divorce attorney .
so we don &apos;t have a / c.
you guys are going to love this .
i invented something even better .
it &apos;s called the ranch system .
the ranch system for cooling .
this is one of my best inventions .
reagan &apos;s going to freak out when she sees it .
check it out . we &apos;ve got a combination of cool winds ,
a @-@ a cool , chilly pond ,
you wear white jeans &apos; cause they don &apos;t absorb heat--
that &apos;s actually science , i did research .
you know , science aside , man ,
you working those jeans .
oh , thanks for saying that , man .
i was insecure about the way they looked .
you killing it , man .
hey , guys . how are you doing ?
well , everything here looks normal .
welcome to the ranch .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
have a seat .
why would i do that ?
it &apos;ll cool you right off . you &apos;ll love it .
ooh . is that chair supposed to be wet ?
it is .
i ...
okay .
and away we ... cool !
check it out !
feels like somebody is learning
to whistle very close to my face .
that &apos;s right , it does .
she said it feels like
someone &apos;s whistling close to her face !
i never thought of that .
it &apos;s another plus .
no .
no , it &apos;s not .
but i have a better idea .
why don &apos;t we all cool off ...
with the brand @-@ new air conditioner that i bought ?
son of a ...
yes ! what ? what ?
a / c ! oh ...
damn .
oh , it was so hot .
oh , yeah , this is wet .
having a / c.
that &apos;s sweat from my bottom .
this is amazing .
thank you , reagan . finally , we can stop living
like people in a beer commercial
before the beer shows up .
how did you pull this off ?
it &apos;s not a big deal . that whole riot thing &apos;s really overblown .
get the hell back !
i will be putting the a / c in my room and everyone is welcome .
no , thank you . we &apos;re good .
i speak for all of us .
okay . well , we are observing gym rules ,
so make sure you wipe down anything you plan to sit on .
whatever .
more breeze for us .
i &apos;m gonna grab some old underpants
and i &apos;ll put a pair
in the freezer for each of you .
trust me , i &apos;m wearing frozen underwear right now ,
and i feel amazing .
so , i &apos;m in good shape .
cece ?
i think maybe you should go ... go hang out by the a / c.
cece &apos;s got a big audition today to be a reporter .
she &apos;s been taking broadcasting classes .
any way you slice it ,
that cafeteria pizza is a great deal .
you know , in fact ,
i &apos;m getting a little hungry myself .
how about you , carl ?
i thought the next thing
i was supposed to talk about
was the rain .
it is , carl .
i was just having a little banter .
i ... uh , i had a sandwich
so ... i &apos;m full .
the audition &apos;s just for
gas station tv , okay ?
nobody watches it .
don &apos;t you dare downplay it .
i adore gas station television ,
i mean , myself , personally .
it is the intersection between information
and also gas .
that &apos;s right . cece , today it &apos;s gas ,
tomorrow , it &apos;s local news--
the next thing you know , you &apos;re reporting
diabetes statistics
as we all watch b @-@ roll
of fat people walking across the street .
i just , i don &apos;t ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna go to the audition .
&apos;cause it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s just so hot .
you know ?
okay .
yeah , i mean , that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s cool .
just ... look , i love you no matter what .
go cool off .
all right .
all right .
can i talk to you for a second ?
what the hell was all that coddling ?
whoa . what are you , a big @-@ bosomed grandma ?
tough love ! make her go !
don &apos;t tell me what to do !
i &apos;m her fiancé ,
not some schnook off the street
eating a peanut butter cookie .
it &apos;s my job to give her love and support .
that &apos;s how i get her to go to the audition .
as a cop , do you think i would get anyone to do anything
if i were being kind and supportive ?
hell no !
look , i have recently found my cop voice
and i &apos;ll tell you this : it is very effective .
is that what you &apos;ve been practicing in the bathroom ?
everybody stop !
make a left turn !
you have the right to remain silent ! you ...
freeze ! nah .
three hundred
and three thousand thelonious thistles ...
handcuffs , handcuffs , handcuffs .
handcuffs , handcuffs , handcuffs , handcuffs .
freeze !
down on the ground ,
fugitive of the law .
handcuffs , handcuffs , handcuffs , handcuffs .
handcuffs , handcuffs .
those were just my warmups .
my point is this , man .
you can &apos;t hug and kiss cece into doing anything .
your mind would melt if you knew
what i &apos;ve hugged and kissed cece into doing .
stay out of it , winston .
my guys .
hey , who needs reagan &apos;s a / c , right ?
here .
put some of my old underwear on your face . it feels great .
oh , nick ...
you &apos;re gonna make a great dad .
i &apos;ll see you later .
okay .
hey ! who needs him , huh ?
we got each other .
we &apos;ve been through worse .
chicago !
chicago !
city of soup , you know ?
yes , sir .
so i &apos;m gonna go take a shower .
i &apos;ll be back in a hot minute .
or , as we say on a day like today ...
... a minute .
that &apos;s great , man .
that &apos;s chill , that &apos;s chill .
that &apos;s great .
thanks for taking my back today .
i &apos;ll see you in a sec .
all right , all right .
you and me , all day . you and me . uh @-@ huh .
yeah , yeah .
look who it is ! what happened ?
the a / c fall over and squish winston &apos;s cat ?
oh , my god , please don &apos;t tell me that happened . i would die .
i just came out here to tell you
that it &apos;s actually really nice in there .
it &apos;s really nice right here ,
with my underpants on my face .
i think maybe you should stop pouting
because i didn &apos;t like whatever this is .
wait , what ?
why would i care if you , specifically , didn &apos;t like it ?
nick .
reagan .
yeah , come on .
you want to go there ?
i want to go where ?
what are you talking about ?
you wanted to impress me
because you have a crush on me .
it &apos;s nice to get a good laugh in this heat .
i need a laugh .
it &apos;s too hot not to laugh .
lord knows it !
you do .
i don &apos;t have a crush on you .
you &apos;re very conceited .
and i don &apos;t mean to burst your bubble here , missy ,
but i am not out here
because of my &quot; so @-@ called crush on you ,
&quot; based on my actions
that led you to believe i have a crush on you . &quot;
i am out here
because i have never been
more comfortable in my entire life .
okay , you know what ? just go get !
winston and i don &apos;t need you , sister .
oh , you mean winston , like , this winston ?
what do you mean , like this ...
oh , winston .
i &apos;m really sorry .
it &apos;s fine , it &apos;s fine . who needs you ?
&apos;cause the hottest part of the day is already over .
it &apos;s 9 : 30 in the morning .
then tell me this :
why did i just eat lunch ?
why did i just eat lunch ?
another guy just collapsed out there .
but the good samaritan to the rescue !
oh , damn . good samaritan just collapsed .
and ups guy to the rescue !
and the ups guy just collapsed .
ah , lady stealing packages ...
oh ! and the lady just collapsed .
whoo . you know , i &apos;m actually kind of getting chilly in here .
look , guys .
i got this box of jess &apos;s weird old ski clothes .
hello , 1989 .
check me out ,
i &apos;m picabo street .
you know who that is , right ?
i don &apos;t know who that is .
real après @-@ ski vibe .
i feel like i &apos;m in gstaad .
gstaad &apos;s all about après @-@ ski .
well , it &apos;s nice in the summer , too .
oh , have you been ?
have you ?
have you ?
have you been , is the real question .
have @-@ have you been to gstaad ?
wh ... i ... what does it matter ? just tell the truth .
have you been there ? have you been there ?
i &apos;m sorry , have you ?
no , i haven &apos;t been there .
should i be ashamed of that ,
or can we all just tell the truth
about whether we &apos;ve been to ... &quot; shtaad . &quot;
please . it &apos;s &quot; gstaad . &quot;
shaad . shtaad .
no one in this room has been to gstaad .
yeah , one more fan .
just a little closer .
okay , that &apos;ll do it .
you guys are suckers in there ! this is great !
should we be worried about him ?
worried about nick ? oh , no , this is just what he does .
okay , but being exposed to the heat for that long
is actually super @-@ dangerous ,
so ... maybe i should go reason with him .
&quot; reason . &quot;
please excuse our immediate but correct response .
will you please just come into my room ? it &apos;s right there .
it &apos;s not even hot in reality .
you &apos;re obviously suffering from heat exhaustion .
it &apos;s like a crisp vermont november .
apple cider , football weather .
don &apos;t jump in a pile of leaves .
there might be a dead dog in there .
you &apos;re slurring your speech .
soon you &apos;re gonna get dizzy , you &apos;re gonna get cramps .
why do you care so much , reagan ?
because you look like a dying man on a hospital show .
oh , i know why .
because you have a crush on me .
no .
yeah .
that &apos;s ... that ...
i ... you &apos;re ... you &apos;re a human being
and i &apos;m worried about ...
you have a crush on me .
no .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re always thinking about me ...
that has nothing to do with that .
... giving me my medicals ,
checking on me , giving me my medicals ...
you said that twice . you are hallucinating .
no , reagan , i &apos;m &quot; ha @-@ truth @-@ inating . &quot;

why are you talking so loud ?
do you have a cranberry stuck in your ear again ?
winston found his cop voice . oh ...

when you know damn well it &apos;s important to you ?
don &apos;t do this .

god , that was so scary .
it was so terrible .
it &apos;s okay .
can you just admit that it &apos;s hot in here ?
there &apos;s no way that you are not hot .
i &apos;m hot .
why are you so worried about old nicky pots and pans ?
i don &apos;t have a crush on you .
you have a crush on me , it &apos;s obvious .
why would i have a crush on you ?
you are the most stubborn , annoying , frustrating person
i have ever met in my entire life .
why don &apos;t you tell that to the judge in your pants ?
verdict &apos;s in . you &apos;re guilty .
where are you going ? !
i &apos;m shutting down your ranch .
leave my ranch out of it !
well , then i &apos;m gonna do this , you idiot .

what is going on ? !
damn ! damn !
reagan , please , let ...
look , she &apos;s the one ... wh ...
no , you &apos;re the one .
now , get down to the basement and fix our power .
but the basement ? there are so many rats .
plus she &apos;ll probably try to make out with me .
please , i would rather make out with a rat .
gross . did you hear what she just said ?
stop ! go to the basement
and stay there until the power is fixed !
yes , sir .
now , i have accidentally pressed all of the buttons ,
but you will stay on the elevator
until you get to the basement !
and when you get to that basement ... aw , damn ...
how is it even hotter down here ?
because the heat stays low , you dummy .
it &apos;s bad enough that we &apos;re down here ,
i can &apos;t explain science to you .
i hope that the chicago cubs
win the world series while you &apos;re in a coma .
that &apos;s one of the meanest things anybody has ever said to me .
we are visitors , let &apos;s act like it .
hello , rats ?
hello ? !
i come to hurt ya .
okay , for those who have not been scared off ,
i actually come in peace .
my name is nick .
i &apos;ve been down here a lot .
hello , nicholas .
i &apos;m jeremiah .
sorry .
why would you ... ?
it &apos;s funny .
very clever .
you got really scared .
i &apos;m not so scared ,
but don &apos;t ever do that again .
it &apos;s also a very good rat voice .
thank you .
but it is a terrible rat name .
jeremiah ? that would never be the name of a rat .
it &apos;s name is , like , sushi .
or &quot; ma @-@ cushi . &quot;
now , follow me .
i want to leave one set of footprints .
that is a perfect plan , but i &apos;m not going to do that .
oh , hello , old friend .
funny seeing you here .
ticktock .
almost audition time .
hey , cece .
huh ?
you know that thing you said before
about you not being talented enough ?
you didn &apos;t mean that , right ?
yeah , i did .
newscasters are amazing .
but so are you .
come on , schmidt , okay ?
i &apos;m a bartender and a model .
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m gonna need you to step out of the vehicle .
yes , do it , baby .
&quot; vehicle &quot; ? what vehicle ?
the metaphorical vehicle that is holding you back .
oh . - don &apos;t explain yourself . just go with it .
you are a brilliant , amazing woman ,
who is capable of anything .
okay , maybe drop the southern accent .
what , you got mozzarell in your ears ?
you &apos;re , uh , get out of your own way , lady , huh ?
uh , tr @-@ try , law &amp; order ... uh , hargitay .
i &apos;ve got a past and it affects my job .
had my relationships-- i can &apos;t really do a mariska .
what is happening here ?
cece , i know the audition is scary for you .
i would not be doing my job as the man who loves you
if i let you walk away from this .
don &apos;t blow it , cece !
you are not walking away from this opportunity !
okay ... - i &apos;m gonna need less talking out of you
and more action , damn it !
wait , no , cece , i &apos;m sorry .
did i take it too far ?
i took it too far , didn &apos;t i ? oh , god .
it &apos;s fine .
i have been down this road many a @-@ times .
she &apos;s gonna come walking back through that door
in three , two ...
look , schmidt , not for nothing ,
man , you got so many good characters inside of you .
oh , my gosh .
did you already bind the 120s ?
yeah , this should do it .
do what ? cook you like barbecue chicken ?
i traced it back . it &apos;s fine .
i wouldn &apos;t do that if i were you .
it &apos;s not safe .
can you admit that i might actually
be right about something for once ?
it &apos;s your own funeral ; you win .
great .
don &apos;t do it !
nick !
fine , let &apos;s just say you are right .
then at least let me do it , okay ?
you don &apos;t have to do that .
i want to do it .
i mean , i don &apos;t , like , want to do it , obviously , but ...
what if i &apos;m wrong ?
if you think this is right , it &apos;s probably right .
you &apos;ve been , you &apos;ve been right about a lot of stuff today .
like what ? what else was i right about ?
just a lot of stuff . i don &apos;t want to talk about
what you were actually right about at this moment .
okay , ready ?
yes .
if i get burned up and die this way ,
it would be such an embarrassing way to go .
but what would be nice about it is
that i would technically have been right .
here we go .
heroes don &apos;t wear capes .
no , no , no ...
those sons of bitches did it .
hey , great !
really good .
that was really great .
what are you looking at ?
you ... rat .
no ! no ! no !
this is my nightmare !
it &apos;s time .
how did i ... ?
did you carry me out like a firefighter ?
no , you woke up right away .
and then you were like , &quot; ooh , i need some fresh air . &quot;
so we came outside , i bought you a muffin
and then you passed out again .
oh , yeah , i remember that muffin .
i feel like you had a pretty bad shock ,
so let &apos;s ask a few questions .
what day of the week is it ?
that &apos;s not something i typically know .
i would guess monday .
okay .
blackout .
atm &apos;s are down .
cash is king
and batteries is queen .
what ? stop being so whimsical , winston .
cece still hasn &apos;t called me back .
i think i pushed her too far .
no , schmidt , you did the right thing , man .
look , people get mad at police officers
because we tell them what they don &apos;t want to hear .
yeah , everyone loves police officer ...
hey , it &apos;s a blackout ,
not the rapture !
you yield !
all right !
hey , hey , hey , sir , sir !
keep it moving ! keep it moving ! keep it moving !
come on , right this way , ma &apos;am .
right this way , ma &apos;am . right this way , ma &apos;am .
right that way , ma &apos;am . sir , go , go , go !
we ain &apos;t got all day !
sir !
cece .
right this way , ma &apos;am . right that way , ma &apos;am .
thank god you &apos;re here .
look ... i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , well , you should be . you really pissed me off .
i wrote something rude on your car .
it was that stupid cop voice .
i shouldn &apos;t have pushed you that hard .
no , you should &apos;ve .
&apos;cause you were right .
i was chickening out .
so i went .
you did ?
mm @-@ hmm .
well , that &apos;s amazing . how did it go ?
real bad .
it went real bad ?
okay , well , you know what ? about it , baby , i &apos;m sure ...
no , no , no , no . they just didn &apos;t ...
it was , it was legitimately terrible
but not because i &apos;m not talented .
i went to the bar first
so i was wasted and wearing shorts ,
which i won &apos;t do next time .
thank you for pushing me .
we need to do that kind of thing for each other .
yes , please .
i agree , unless ,
of course , it &apos;s about me using face wash all over my body .
ah , this again , really ?
i don &apos;t care that it &apos;s expensive .
i know that you don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m just gonna keep on doing it .
oh , ice cream truck ! oh !
right this way !
here we go , sir . here we go , sir .
here we go , sir . all right , stop !
ice cream , man , open up .
where &apos;s the ice cream at ?
can i buy you some ice cream ?
first , uh , i just want to revisit that little moment
in the basement where you were like ,
&quot; hey , reagan , you &apos;ve been right about a lot of stuff today . &quot;
really ?
i just want you to specifically tell me what
i &apos;ve been right about .
you are out of control .
you &apos;re a grown man . i just think you should be
able to say it .
you dick .
i have a crush on you .
there it is .
i have a crush on you .
isn &apos;t that better ?
now we can just put it behind us ,
move on , don &apos;t have to be weird .
no , i , obviously , i @-@ i know it &apos;s not gonna be a problem , reagan .
i don &apos;t have any illusion
that you &apos;re gonna go for a guy like me .
i am a total mess . i understand that .
i mean , you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re beautiful ,
and @-@ and you &apos;re smart ,
and you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re mean ,
but in a hot way .
and @-@ and you have the @-@ the mind of an electrician ,
which is so confusingly hot ,
because that is not , like , a sexy ...
excuse me , is your name stephanie ?
i &apos;m supposed to be meeting somebody here .
it &apos;s nick .
so , not stephanie .
hey , yo , nick , you coming , man ?
great .
what is this , a frozen banana , winston ?
okay , okay .
while you &apos;re gassing up ,
let &apos;s look at the stock merkins .
marts ... nope !
is this ... is this here ?
or is it more here ? your frame ?
because i don &apos;t want to just be like ,
you know , a head that &apos;s like ...
scientists have discovered a new kind of butter .
fly in the amazon .
what the crap does that mean ?
i &apos;m so sorry . sorry , sorry , sorry .
you don &apos;t ... is this ... ?
i don &apos;t know who i borrowed this from .
