if holbrook &apos;s helping alison ,
then she probably convinced him that she &apos;s the victim .
alison , please !
i want you to meet somebody .
talia sandoval , emily fields .
your mom told my mom that i could rent your guesthouse .
i &apos;m jonny raymond .
i can &apos;t vouch for the egg salad ,
but the peanut butter cookie , four stars .
listen to this ! don &apos;t you understand you &apos;re making it worse ?
there are things that i can &apos;t know about--
surprise , surprise .
who do you think it was ? holbrook ?
i can write a better letter .
talmadge recently hired jackie molina
as an admissions officer .
as in your ex jackie , who hates my guts ?
jackie read it . it worked .
what are you gonna tell us ezra ?
跟一个年纪比我大的人纠缠不清
toby was on a search at mona &apos;s property ,
and found a bloody knife .
where &apos;s the knife ? is it in there ?
wait . so the knife you and caleb found was covered in blood ?
what , mona &apos;s blood ?
yeah , and any of our prints could have been on it .
thank god you got rid of it .
do we think holbrook planted it ?
well , you vouched for him .
you still think he &apos;s a good guy ?
i &apos;m not so sure anymore .
i bailed on my college visit
to go track down holbrook &apos;s dad .
and that whole family emergency thing is a lie .
i mean , holbrook could still be around .
he could have planted it .
you should have called us last night , hanna .
as soon as you got home .
well , it was late .
wait a second .
so if alison &apos;s &quot; a &quot; and holbrook &apos;s on her side ,
they could pin mona &apos;s murder on us , couldn &apos;t they ?
i don &apos;t know . i have to get home .
em , do you want me to drop that off in the mail on my way ?
i &apos;m good . i &apos;ll go later .
if it &apos;s something you &apos;re having trouble letting go of ,
we can do it for you .
this is not holding on .
this is strictly here &apos;s your stuff . i promise .
i found , like , three pairs of her swim goggles ,
and some of her cds in my car .
are you still going for spring break ?
i thought that paige asked for some space .
she did , so i &apos;m not .
my shift &apos;s about to start .
i &apos;m out , too .
cute shirt , by the way .
have i borrowed that ?
probably not .
well , maybe i should .
can i get a refill ? i didn &apos;t sleep last night .
aria , i was here all night .
holbrook didn &apos;t come to the party .
there &apos;s no way he could have left you that bookmark .
all right , well , somebody did .
and i &apos;ve really got to find another college to apply to
before ezra finds out how i got into talmadge .
how much ?
just take it .
no , i &apos;ve already lied to ezra .
i don &apos;t want to steal , too .
even if it is just a cup of coffee .
okay , then . fifty cents .
since when ?
new brew , new prices .
here .
new register . what &apos;s going on ?
what ?
aria , this is the letter you wrote to jackie .
make it stop .
i &apos;m trying .
what does it say ?
&quot; this kind of lie will stay on your permanent record . a. &quot;
hanna ? is that you ?
yeah .
you &apos;re home .
oh , hey , ted . how was peru ?
good .
put a new roof on a chapel ,
built a playground for our sponsor school ,
dreamed about your mother &apos;s waffles .
you know they eat guinea pigs ?
hmm . wacky .
you didn &apos;t hear me come home last night ?
didn &apos;t hear me call either .
tried to warn you i was coming back early .
i had a long week at work .
must have slept like a rock last night .
waffles are done .
looks like it &apos;s a nice day out .
do you want to eat on the patio ?
yeah , sure .
so why did you come back early ?
i thought the college had events planned for saturday and sunday .
i had a migraine .
why were you gone when i woke up this morning ?
ted wanted to come over for breakfast .
i was getting syrup .
so you weren &apos;t avoiding me ?
no , i was under the impression you would be gone all weekend .
you left because of a headache ?
wait , are you mad that i bailed
or that i walked in on your wild college weekend ?
look , whatever you think you saw--
mom , i know what i saw .
and i just don &apos;t understand why .
could we just talk about it ?
hanna , take this orange juice outside , please .
mom .
orange juice , hanna . please .
careful . cup &apos;s hot .
nice foam , but if you start at the top
and work your way down at the bottom .
i &apos;m pretty sure i can figure it out .
thanks , though .
i &apos;m in your territory .
i &apos;ll just give you your space .
is everything okay with you two ?
yeah .
just ... defining job duties .
do you want me to say anything ?
no . it &apos;s okay , we &apos;ll work it out .
hey . can we--
i &apos;m so sorry , this is the contractor .
i &apos;ve been trying to get a hold of him all day .
i &apos;ll be right back .
it &apos;s because you disappeared for three days on another job .
and i &apos;ll tell you what .
when you get back to me ,
it better be with a refund check .
i &apos;m sorry .
you know the shelves that i put in with mike ?
this guy is trying to charge me for the installation .
sorry , can i do something to help ?
no , no , it &apos;s all right .
um . look , ezra--
oh , did you have fun last night ?
i think bob milsom really liked you .
and i know that he could speak on your behalf
to the admission staff at vassar .
it &apos;s one phone call .
yeah , yeah , that would be great--
i &apos;m so sorry .
this joker . i have to take this .
hello ?
oh , you can &apos;t find the copy of the invoice .
why don &apos;t i send you mine ?
aren &apos;t you gonna open them ?
i don &apos;t need to open them . i already know what they say .
three acceptance letters .
you don &apos;t seem excited .
come on , the university of hawaii .
listen , i know i shouldn &apos;t have stormed off like that last night ...
this is not about you storming off , okay ?
this is about me needing to put zinc on my nose
for the next four years ,
and people wearing flip @-@ flops to class .
a lot of people would love to go to school in hawaii .
well , i love brick and ivy and
wool pea coats .
i don &apos;t even want to go to these schools .
i just applied to them because they &apos;re far away from here .
but you applied to schools you don &apos;t want to go to ?
just to get far away from rosewood ?
after what happened with mona ,
we all decided that it would be smart
to get as far away from alison as possible .
god , how is she still deciding where i go and what i do ?
she &apos;s behind bars ,
and i still cannot get far enough away from her .
new mexico ? montana ?
let &apos;s say that i do go to the university of hawaii .
she &apos;ll be here . in jail .
right .
and she was able to plant a murder weapon
in mona &apos;s backyard for you to find .
you didn &apos;t think she can book a plane ticket ?
we don &apos;t know--
look , you don &apos;t know , okay ?
we are pretty sure that she has help .
well , none of us will ever know that for sure , will we ?
hey , jonny .
hi .
i &apos;m a little early .
that &apos;s fine . keys ?
and here &apos;s deposit , first and last .
a lot of it , not all of it ,
it &apos;s mostly fives and ones .
i &apos;ll make sure that my mom gets this .
toby , this is jonny , this is toby .
jonny &apos;s gonna be living in the barn .
welcome to the neighborhood .
i should probably get going to work .
yeah . bye .
thanks .
so . your boyfriend &apos;s a cop ?
yeah , he wasn &apos;t always .
em , come here .
i just got a message .
&quot; stop looking for me . i &apos;m tired of hiding .
grille at noon . h. &quot; as in holbrook ?
you are not meeting him by yourself .
why ? it &apos;s in the middle of town in the middle of the day .
and i don &apos;t think this is an &quot; a &quot; trap .
i can handle this alone .
the least i can do is just hear him out .
if holbrook &apos;s tired of dishing out alison &apos;s revenge ,
i might not have to tell ezra about that letter .
here we go .
hammer .
let me know if you need anything else .
cool .
where &apos;s your garbage ?
right there .
are you transferring ?
&apos;cause hollis is kind of on the opposite side of town .
that &apos;s good to know , but i &apos;m not .
i mean , i might .
i haven &apos;t decided yet .
i &apos;ve been traveling , mostly .
i can make you a sandwich .
that &apos;d be great .
no ham , though .
ham &apos;s got a sketchy texture .
i &apos;m not grocery shopping . these are art supplies .
for color . coffee grounds . score .
do you make your own paint ?
when i need to .
especially after a deposit first and last months &apos; rent .
were you in italy ?
about a month . how did you ...
we studied the renaissance ,
and i did a project on botticelli .
so i made my own tempera paints from scratch .
i &apos;d love to hear about your trip .
i &apos;ve always wanted to go to italy .
i &apos;ll make you a deal .
i &apos;ll give you a travelogue if you let me borrow an egg .
yeah , deal .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m gonna need to-- to go .
i &apos;ll get you the egg later .
sure . i &apos;ll see ya .
10 : 48 激活
yeah , aria got the same text .
we &apos;re at caleb &apos;s , we &apos;re trying to figure it out .
okay , em , i &apos;ll call you when we &apos;re done .
all right , so obviously ghosts don &apos;t have fingers .
so how was mona sending us texts ?
not a ghost . an alert .
sent automatically by a security company .
mona put some kind of lojack on her laptop before she died .
someone must have gotten through the encryption , set off an alarm .
yeah , there were a bunch of numbers .
gps coordinates .
probably the location where the laptop was used .
looks like it &apos;s a storage place off of the turnpike .
it &apos;s still there .
i logged in to the security company &apos;s website .
so that blinky thing ,
that &apos;s where ali hid mona &apos;s laptop ?
could mona have set this up to alert the police ?
it &apos;s an option , but she didn &apos;t .
she sent it to the four of you .
and usually , mona &apos;s security is incredibly tight ,
but it &apos;s almost like she purposely
made it easy for me to log in .
so we could get her laptop back if ali took it ?
or so we could track down whoever took the laptop
without them knowing that we were coming .
do you guys think this is where holbrook is hiding ?
well , aria &apos;s gonna text us when she &apos;s at the grille .
if holbrook &apos;s with her ,
then that gives us time to go and look around .
that was fast .
who &apos;s driving ?
hold your horses , it &apos;s for me .
hey , ted .
yeah , yeah , i &apos;ll meet you there .
pastor back ?
yeah , this morning . i have to go meet him .
that &apos;s aria .
do you want us to drop you off ?
no . i &apos;ll go by myself .
everything okay ?
yeah .
oh , and if you see anything suspicious ,
don &apos;t pick it up .
please don &apos;t let him pick anything up .
and what &apos;s that thing they say about rats in the corner ?
a cornered rat will bite ?
yes .
remember , holbrook &apos;s a rat .
aria .
jason .
are you meeting someone ?
yeah .
yeah , i am , but i don &apos;t think they &apos;re gonna show up .
how are you ? since--
since i basically put my sister in prison ?
well , we can start at tense and work our way on from there .
how is she ?
she &apos;s tried to call us a few times , but--
you don &apos;t have to explain .
i went to see her once .
that was enough .
do you want to grab a bite ?
i was supposed to meet ashley ,
hanna &apos;s mom , for a working lunch ,
but she just canceled .
it might actually might be nice to talk about alison .
yeah . yeah , it might .
oh , there &apos;s stuff in the kitchen , if you want to clean .
i can show you .
i know . in the supply closet .
i &apos;m just gonna go and put this with the rest .
oh , that &apos;s not usually where we keep that stuff .
listen , i just had some down @-@ time ,
and i don &apos;t do well with idle hands .
if there &apos;s some things you think we should change , then great .
just bring it up before you decide on your own .
deal ?
deal .
i actually did want to ask ,
do you think ezra would go for a new uniform ?
uniform ?
yeah , nothing fancy .
just a polo with the logo .
you know , something casual , and cohesive .
just a little ...
neater .
neater than what ?
well , i was just noticing earlier
that there &apos;s a little hole in the shoulder of your shirt .
and so i started thinking that maybe--
it &apos;s a t @-@ shirt . it &apos;s comfortable .
yeah , just maybe something a little darker ,
so that the stains don &apos;t show .
okay , maybe one new idea at a time .
i &apos;ve got some bolt cutters in my car .
i like to be prepared .
they won &apos;t work on that . it &apos;s a shrouded lock .
hard to cut , even harder to pick .
spencer ?
mrs. horowitz .
you look familiar .
did you transfer out of my third period last semester ?
no , i wasn &apos;t in your class .
probably just saw me in the halls .
i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom . i &apos;ll be right back .
my friend just got an apartment .
and so we &apos;re just getting some things
out of storage for him .
are you here often ?
every month or so . why ?
well , i guess this really isn &apos;t the kind of place
where you get to know your neighbors .
you &apos;re talking about 1017 , aren &apos;t you ?
that smell , am i right ?
smell ?
oh , yeah , there &apos;s some sort of an odor .
it wafts down the hallway sometimes .
i think it &apos;s coming from that unit .
have you ever spoken to the renter ?
about a month or so , there was a girl , blonde .
hey , if it starts to smell again ,
you think you could say something to the manager ?
sure , yeah .
what does the blonde girl look like ?
just in case i spot her .
i tried to stop her , but she was in a hurry .
i didn &apos;t get to see her face .
not that management would care anyway .
they ought to do something about it .
it &apos;s really unsanitary .
yeah , absolutely .
bye , mrs. horowitz .
see you in school .
is she coming back ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
where did you go ?
i made a shim out of your teacher &apos;s soda can .
we &apos;re gonna use it to pick the lock .
i thought you said that you can &apos;t pick that lock .
not that lock .
her lock .
forget about the alibi .
does your dad really believe her ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
i mean , he only knows how to protect her .
he &apos;ll do the same thing on the witness stand ,
even if he knows what she &apos;s capable of .
what do you think she &apos;s capable of ?
a lot .
i &apos;ve seen her do things .
i &apos;ve seen her talk people into things .
i mean , the way you girls used to follow her around--
used to .
i know you &apos;re not on the best of terms , but ...
the police have a theory .
they think she had help .
with mona ?
after .
putting mona &apos;s body in the trunk of her car ,
hiding it or dumping it .
yeah , we kind of think the same thing .
do you remember when she passed that lie detector test ?
someone on the inside ,
who could change the results , make sure she passed .
is there anything you noticed between alison and holbrook ?
i &apos;ve only dealt with him a few times .
not that i would have noticed .
she can get away with things right under your nose .
yeah , well , we think that they might be close .
that she talked him into doing things .
god , what is it with cops in this town ?
一个小时 梅普和普莱斯考特 汉娜
so you think that is possible ?
i can &apos;t say for sure .
but ali &apos;s probably cut him loose by now .
what else can he do for her ?
babe , you sound really echo @-@ y .
like you &apos;re in an air duct .
that &apos;s because i &apos;m in an air duct .
ted &apos;s waiting for me .
just call me if you find anything .
okay .
let &apos;s sit down .
so ...
i want to talk to you about your mother .
i &apos;m pretty sure that you should
probably talk to her about this .
she knows that i know .
but how do you know ?
because i know .
but i haven &apos;t asked you yet .
wait , asked me what ?
for your permission .
hanna ,
i &apos;d like to marry your mother .
well , i still think that you should
probably talk to her about this .
i really would like for you , me , and
and your mom to be a family .
and if we &apos;re going to be a family ,
i want to make sure you &apos;re all in .
when ?
tonight .
over dinner at the house , and i want you to be there .
tonight ?
yeah , definitely , i &apos;m totally in .
is it gonna be like a fancy dinner or ?
super @-@ casual . like any other night .
i want her to be surprised .
don &apos;t worry . my lips are sealed .
thanks .
hey , mom .
call me back when you get this .
i really need to talk to you .
it &apos;s a flower shop .
what &apos;s a flower shop ?
where i &apos;m meeting holbrook .
he must &apos;ve seen me talking to jason and gotten spooked .
he wants to meet me alone .
if he &apos;s really crossing ali ,
i guess he wouldn &apos;t want it getting back to her .
just ... check in , okay ?
yeah , i will .
your t @-@ shirt was a gift ?
what ?
from the ex ?
you got defensive
when i pointed out the hole in your shirt .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
it is , and i &apos;m sorry .
you know , when someone &apos;s important to you ,
it can be hard to let go .
there &apos;s this dish and it &apos;s a beef stew .
it &apos;s called ropa vieja .
it literally means &quot; old clothes . &quot;
it &apos;s just one of those old recipes that
comes from a hundred different places ,
and everybody makes it the same way ,
over and over .
you know , every once in a while ,
you got to add some yellow peppers , green olives ,
you know , flavor , color .
and then the same old thing can feel brand @-@ new .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m ready to feel brand @-@ new .
well , how can you when you &apos;re carrying
your old relationship around on your back ?
yeah .
you got it ?
yeah .
that &apos;s mona &apos;s computer .
no , don &apos;t touch anything .
it &apos;s really neat in here , it &apos;s too neat .
everything &apos;s bagged .
it &apos;s clear plastic . it looks like evidence .
holbrook ?
there &apos;s so much blood on these clothes .
do you think this is what mona was wearing when she died ?
why &apos;s he keeping them ?
maybe the more important question is ,
is this where he kept the knife until he planted it ?
he &apos;s keeping it to build a case ...
against one of us .
get down .
there &apos;s someone else in here , behind the shelves .
wait .
wait here .
don &apos;t .
it &apos;s just an empty suit .
and a barrel .
are you thinking what i &apos;m thinking ?
that she &apos;s in there ?
it sounds full .
and mona wasn &apos;t very big .
okay . mona was a lot of things , but ...
she didn &apos;t deserve this .
denatured alcohol . antacid tablets .
water .
okay , i didn &apos;t take chemistry .
it &apos;s biology .
when you mix those together in the right proportion ,
you can preserve a specimen--
a frog , a pig fetus , any vertebrate , really .
and what if you mix them wrong ?
it &apos;s corrosive .
you turn whatever specimen you have to sludge .
so she &apos;s either being pickled or dissolved ?
did you really just say that ?
sorry .
should we open it ?
aria ?
here to pick up , right ?
no , i &apos;m just ...
a guy called , said you &apos;d pick up and hand deliver .
was his name ...
i &apos;m here by myself .
delivery address is 34 turning leaf lane .
the cross streets .
yeah .
yeah , i know where that is . thank you .
okay .
加州 帕罗奥图市
where have you been ? i need to talk to you .
we &apos;re not gonna talk about that .
that is the least of your problems .
i called , i texted .
relax , hanna . i was not doing that .
that is none of your business .
yes , it is . and it &apos;s kind of ted &apos;s business , too .
god , jason ? why ?
aren &apos;t you , like , working for him now ?
are you gonna lose your job over this ?
jason and i ... it was nothing .
it wasn &apos;t nothing .
mom , he &apos;s alison &apos;s brother .
i am aware of that , and it &apos;s not something
i &apos;m comfortable with either .
what is going on ?
i mean , you love ted , right ?
because he really loves you and he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s what , hanna ?
he &apos;s just a really good guy ,
and i like him .
and i like him with you .
and i don &apos;t want anything to ruin that .
are you going to tell him ?
that is for me to decide ,
not you .
you sure you wiped down everything ?
only things i touched were the light switch
and the air duct covers .
i think we &apos;re good .
what if we left hair ?
fiber ? skin cells ?
i think you &apos;re being paranoid .
possibly , if i were being excessively or unreasonably anxious ,
according to merriam @-@ webster ,
but there is nothing unreasonable or excessive
about wanting to keep us all out of jail .
i &apos;m being meticulous .
actually , you &apos;re being a thesaurus ,
but i appreciate your attention to detail .
done . security footage is wiped .
no sign that we were ever there .
and no sign of that blonde or holbrook .
we need to figure out a way to tie holbrook
into that storage space
without getting tied up into it ourselves .
we could always call toby .
tip him off .
let the cops find out what was in that barrel .
opening that barrel would have just been
playing into holbrook &apos;s hands .
besides , i really don &apos;t want to risk toby &apos;s job .
when we have proof that
that &apos;s where holbrook does ali &apos;s dirty work ,
then we &apos;ll have something to turn in .
what about the lease ?
could you maybe get into their records ?
find a renter &apos;s agreement with a name ?
yeah , shouldn &apos;t take long .
okay .
i really should have gone after that knife on my own .
if it makes you feel any better ,
toby &apos;s not really talking to me either .
he &apos;s talking to me , there &apos;s just ...
not really much to say .
what &apos;s the big secret ?
hey , is your mom here ?
i was supposed to deliver these to her ,
but i think that something &apos;s up .
hanna ? who &apos;s at the door ?
it &apos;s aria .
tell her we &apos;re still eating , please .
yeah . just one second . go upstairs .
honey ,
whatever it is , make it quick , okay ?
yeah . no . it &apos;s just a school thing .
i &apos;ll be down in a couple minutes , i promise .
&quot; last night took me by surprise .
glad i stayed for dessert . jason . &quot;
wait , what ?
since when does your mom bake ?
and why was jason ...
this isn &apos;t jason .
this is alison trying to start trouble .
why ? what do you and your mom have to do with jason ?
forget about jason . i did this .
okay , i went to see her in jail .
i &apos;m sorry . you did what ?
i had to .
i thought she was going after caleb .
when i heard about that bloody knife--
we agreed , hanna , none of us were supposed to .
i spent the whole day
running on her hamster wheel because of you .
well , i faced her for all of us .
and i told her to back off . this is her , backing off .
you should have told us .
i &apos;ll tell the others , okay ? i promise .
just don &apos;t mention the flowers , please .
fine .
for a town where some pretty awful things have happened ,
today , almost nothing happened .
come on , something must have happened .
i responded to a total of two calls .
an 11 @-@ 26 and a 10 @-@ 91l .
so rosewood is now safe from an abandoned bicycle
and an off @-@ leash labradoodle .
we haven &apos;t done this in a while .
i &apos;ve missed it .
yeah , me too .
you know , we haven &apos;t talked about this college ,
the distance . maybe we should .
we &apos;ve been apart before .
yeah , but surfboard or bricks and ivy ,
you &apos;re gonna be gone .
i don &apos;t want to hold you back ,
but i also can &apos;t get used to the thought
of you being an ocean away .
then maybe you can come with me .
you can learn how to surf .
it &apos;s really chilly . i &apos;ll close the window .
&quot; found something . call me . &quot;
what did you and caleb find ?
what did you and caleb find ?
i can &apos;t tell you .
this isn &apos;t about telling .
this is about not doing things that will get you both ,
all of us , in a lot of trouble .
so whatever you did today , that &apos;s it .
i want it to stop .
whatever you say , officer .
clean the dishes please , hanna .
sure .
i &apos;ve got dessert .
all right , here we go .
do we all get a cookie , ted , or ...
it &apos;s not just any cookie . it &apos;s a peanut butter cookie .
we shared one of these the first day we met .
and i was thinking ,
maybe we could share one of these tonight .
ted .
hold on . i &apos;ve still got a few more formalities to get through .
when i moved to this town ,
i knew it would bring tremendous change to my life .
turns out that change was you .
there &apos;s something bigger than both of us
that put you in my path .
and i want to spend the rest of our lives together
being grateful for the gift of you .
ashley ,
will you marry me ?
i need a minute to think .
you just took her by surprise , that &apos;s all .
she &apos;s had a really long stressful week at work ,
and you came home early .
well , either she doesn &apos;t like surprises ,
or there &apos;s something wrong with my timing .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with you , ted .
you did everything right .
you just have to give her a minute to take it all in .
i will .
thanks , hanna .
i should &apos;ve see him out .
he is such a good man .
he deserves the truth .
as soon as this week , i &apos;ll have an actual office in the back .
are you here for your paycheck ?
yeah .
great .
i think it &apos;s over by the register .
oh , i can just--
oh , no , no , no . let me get it .
it &apos;s my first payday as boss ,
and kind of looking forward to it .
soda ?
don &apos;t like coffee . love caffeine .
is this you outside of work ?
i may have to rethink that whole uniform idea .
i &apos;m not dressed up or anything .
just picking up my check .
casual looks good on you .
thanks .
yeah .
can i ask you something ?
it &apos;s not work related , i promise .
okay .
what do you think about that ?
it &apos;s cute buns on the boss man , right ?
yeah . yeah . i guess .
hey , did you need something ?
egg .
what ?
egg .
the cop was here , so i waited .
but you owe me .
an egg . i am sorry . i forgot .
come in .
can &apos;t really make paint without a binder .
did i ruin your plans ?
i read a bit to pass the time .
got kind of sucked into the local news .
anything exciting ?
there &apos;s nothing but excitement around here .
that body in your backyard is just the tip of the iceberg .
yeah . not quite the town you remember , huh ?
we left when i was a kid ,
but i don &apos;t remember anything like this .
were you really friends with her ?
that girl who murdered a classmate ?
yeah , i was . not so much anymore .
with her in the halls ,
i can imagine why you &apos;d date a cop .
try next @-@ door neighbor .
trying to get as far away from her as possible ?
earlier , i saw the acceptance letters .
have you bothered to open them yet ?
after everything that &apos;s happened ,
i really don &apos;t know if i can handle anything
as mundane as college .
the iceberg runs deep .
i bailed .
after a semester .
it &apos;s just a bunch of kids sitting on bunk beds ,
trying to figure out what to do with the rest of their lives .
that sounds like the worst sleep @-@ away camp ever .
so you just quit school and traveled ?
i want to study art , and then make it .
bought a ticket to europe ,
haunted as many museums as i could .
i &apos;d trade a sketch or a canvas for room ,
board , a ride to the next town .
there &apos;s no rule that says you have to go to college .
if you want to ,
you can just ...
go .
you need to get that ?
no .
so tell me about italy .
well , it doesn &apos;t actually begin in italy .
it started in london .
is your mom up ?
i think she cried herself to sleep .
ted popped the question tonight .
and she cried ?
they still haven &apos;t figured it out yet .
wait , have you been with spencer this whole time ?
you didn &apos;t even call me back .
yeah . i got your message .
listen ,
spencer asked me to look into something ,
and it took longer than i thought .
about the storage unit ?
i found out the name on the rental agreement .
well , who rented it ? holbrook ? alison ?
hanna , that storage unit is rented in your name ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure that mona &apos;s body is hidden inside of it .
