lyle pollard ?
he called this morning . he said that , uh ,
that the police were at his home ,

and we &apos;d supervise the questioning .
regarding ?
what ?
the @-@ the questions are regarding ... ?
oh , uh , i have no idea .
mr. canning .
why are you talking to my clients ?
well , your assistant couldn &apos;t find you this morning .
uh , and she said it was an important client .
so i just took it .
i mean , next time i won &apos;t if you don &apos;t want me to .
let me think about that .

oh , so probably shouldn &apos;t .
depends on your taste for adventure .
no cell phone use .
oh , diane , thank god !
is he here ?
robbie ? no , not yet . what happened ?
they say he &apos;s selling pot .
can you believe robbie &apos;s selling pot ?
do you know why all the police ?
yeah , sure .
you know why .
they &apos;re still after me
for the work i did in the &apos; 68 convention .
they drive by the house every day .
oh , here he is . robbie .
don &apos;t worry , i just went to the bathroom .
what &apos;s up ?
we need to talk .
uh , just to be clear .
i am allowing my client to answer a limited number of questions
to aid your investigation
as long as the conversation is proffer @-@ protected .
it is . thank you .
do you know what silk road is , robbie ?
a black market site ?
yeah , it &apos;s a marketplace for the sale of drugs .
marijuana , cocaine , mda ,
价格 0.0834比特币
价格 0.1290比特币
价格 0.1342比特币
heroin , assault weapons
价格 0.0567比特币
价格 21.2043比特币
and even murder .
what amazon is to book clubbers ,
silk road is to criminals .
have you ever logged into it ?
no .
not even to peruse it ?
he already said no !
well , $ 1.2 billion illegal goods
are bought and sold on silk road .
now , that makes it a class one felony
for anyone involved in running the site .
i &apos;m not hearing a lot of questions , mr. polmar .
we traced money
from silk road to your computer , robbie .
you traced money ? what money ?
65 bitcoin worth approximately $ 39,000 .
we found it deposited in robbie &apos;s digital wallet .
i &apos;ve never bought anything or sold anything on silk road .
the money that we traced was to an employee .
you &apos;re an employee of silk road .
robbie &apos;s in college .
he &apos;s graduating in may .
he &apos;s writing his thesis for god &apos;s sake .
we &apos;ve worked with bitcoin before , mr. polmar .
it &apos;s an anonymous currency .
you can &apos;t trace it .
oh , you couldn &apos;t .
until mt . gox was bankrupted .
2014年初爆出平台被黑 比特币流失 随后破产
the bitcoin exchange .
then law enforcement was suddenly allowed access to the servers ,
which meant that we could trace
the bitcoin to robbie &apos;s computer .
now , a class one felony , robbie ?
four years to 15 years in prison .
mr. polmar , let &apos;s talk in private .
shall we ?
yeah .
mr. canning , do you have a minute ?
why aren &apos;t you arresting him ?
i want to know what he knows .
so , you &apos;re looking for a plea ?
yeah .
yeah , one year of jail time for getting us
to the top dog at silk road .
and yet , you &apos;re questioning him here
and not at the police station ?
that &apos;s true .
you didn &apos;t want to be seen strong @-@ arming
a kid with cerebral palsy ?
oh , come on .
especially one who was an attorney like ...
louis canning .
hello , i &apos;m louis canning .
nice to meet you .
uh , this is asa polmar .
uh , why don &apos;t you , uh ,
describe your disorder , mr. canning ?
yeah , it &apos;s , uh , tardive dyskinesia .
it &apos;s a neurological disorder ...
which plays well on camera .
especially if he has a client with cerebral palsy .
your client &apos;s involved in one of the biggest
criminal conspiracies of the 21st century .
all you have is a few bitcoin ...
and you &apos;re running for state &apos;s attorney , aren &apos;t you ?
what does that have to do with this ?
well , you wouldn &apos;t want to be seen
falsely accusing another young man .
especially since your last wrongful prosecution
resulted in the death of an attorney and a witness .
i have a witness .
to what ?
your client
participating in silk road .
but you have another problem .
lyle pollard .
he &apos;s one of your richest clients , isn &apos;t he ?
well , robbie worked on silk road in his grandfather &apos;s basement .
that means that i can freeze his grandfather &apos;s assets .
juror 499 , please state your name .
uh , daniel irwin .
and your occupation .
i @-@ i design batteries .
what does that entail ?
uh , well , i &apos;m , uh ,
i &apos;m working on a lithium ion battery
that &apos;s 2,000 times more powerful than current batteries .
it &apos;s for use in computers and in cars .
that &apos;s very impressive .
do you think that you could judge
this case of indecent exposure fairly ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t , uh , know .
i have friends who ... friends who are lawyers ,
and that might influence me .
the defense has no objections to this juror ,
your honor .
juror 503 , please state your name .
alicia florrick .
i see . uh , you are the governor &apos;s wife .
i am .
and you &apos;re a lawyer .
yes .
well , it was very nice to meet you , mrs. florrick .
uh , the defense would like
to exercise its preemptory challenge .
okay , the juror is excused . thank you .
well , it was very nice to meet you .
well , next time i &apos;ll say i &apos;m a lawyer .
good luck .
that &apos;s it , i &apos;m done .
no more jury duty .
ah , that was easy .
yeah .
i &apos;m coming in . i &apos;ll see you in a few minutes .
nope .
what do you mean ?
you &apos;re not coming in .
how am i not coming in ?
because ... i &apos;m forcing you to have a day off .
cary , thanks .
but i have a lot ...
no , you don &apos;t .
seriously , how many days have you had off
in the last five years ?
i don &apos;t know .
i do . the same as me-- none .
so today is your day off .
this is my gift to you .
take it .
thanks , cary . you &apos;re a good man .
nah , i &apos;m a good partner .
okay , i &apos;m taking the day off .
this is me taking the day off .
i didn &apos;t do it .
i know , but how did this bitcoin
end up on your computer ?
they use zombie computers . maybe it was that ?
he &apos;s been busy doing his graduate work . he &apos;s had no time ...
lyle , could you give us a minute ?
w @-@ w @-@ what do you mean ?
could you step out for a minute ?
why ? !
i &apos;ll come and get you . please ?
they say they have a witness , robbie .
how could they have a witness ?
lyle , wait in reception , please .
he &apos;s innocent . this is about the cops .
i know . reception .
kalinda , do you have a minute ?
sure .
look , everybody wants to rebel .
i mean , for me in @-@ in college
it @-@ it was girls .
the key is to not let it affect the rest of your life .
everybody wants a clean slate .
this is a chance to make this yours .
so , tell us .
we @-@ we &apos;ll find a way to tell your grandfather .
he will understand .
believe me , i promise you .
i wrote reviews for them .
for silk road ?
yeah .
they wanted some business .
they paid me to write client reviews
to get more sales moving .
right . but you didn &apos;t sample the product .
no , they @-@ they weren &apos;t real reviews .
they were just planted .
you know , &quot; great high , fast delivery . &quot;
i created a ratings system for the quality of the high :
&quot; five william s. burroughs . &quot;
「 垮掉的一代 」 文学运动的创始者之一
it was all a joke .
that &apos;s what you were paid for ?
yeah .
what ?
i never did anything . i just wrote reviews .
but you abetted $ 1.2 billion in drug sales .
it makes you an accessory .
who paid you ?
uh , this is our investigator .
hi .
i don &apos;t know .
it was all done anonymously .
they say they have a witness , robbie .
who can that be ?
i don &apos;t know .
what ?
there was this girl .
i was just talking to her near school .
i offered to write her a review
if she ever got on silk road to sell anything .
and what was her name ?
hi , uh , corsica . sorry to interrupt you .
yeah , come on in . i &apos;ve got two new types .
northern lights , b @-@ 52 on the coffee table .
nice .
yeah , uh @-@ huh .
no , not tonight . but look , someone &apos;s here .
i &apos;ll call you back , okay ?
so , what are you looking for ?
actually , i &apos;m looking for
information on robbie pollard .
i have nothing to say .
i think you already had something to say ... to the police .
you &apos;re not in any danger .
i just want to know what you told the police .
they were gonna arrest me .
all i did was give his name .
did you give any other names ?
no , i &apos;ve never met anyone else from silk road .
i told them robbie offered
to write me a review , that &apos;s all .
i didn &apos;t tell them everything .
what do you mean by &quot; everything &quot; ?
you know ...
that robbie invented silk road .
look , i told corsica i invented silk road ,
but i didn &apos;t know she &apos;d believe me .
i just said it . i was just ...
she was pretty , and i was trying to impress her .
well , she believed you .
but she didn &apos;t call the police .
no . she said she was worried that robbie
would hurt her .
that i would ?
she said that you were in charge of silk road ,
it was your invention
and that you had $ 100 million in bitcoin hidden away in iceland .
robbie , if you aren &apos;t in charge of silk road ...
i &apos;m not . i ...
then you have got to give the asa something he can use .
do you have anything that would lead to someone higher up ?
no , it was all anonymous .
how did they contact you ,
the leaders of silk road ?
through e @-@ mail .
but it was over tor , everything encrypted .
you show me ?
i have to do the voice @-@ recognition .
it &apos;s programmed for my dysarthria .
computer , launch tor .
go to cloak and veil .
where are we , diane ?
without committing ourselves ,
we might be willing to make a deal .
good . we want the guy who runs it .
we &apos;re trying to work on that now .
roger , hi . thank you for the flowers .
no , i wanted to thank you .
great work . some of your best yet .
thank you . i &apos;m just , uh ... which work are we talking about ?
listen to you ! so humble .
the business plan . talk about going the extra mile .
well , i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m glad you &apos;re happy .
so , um , roger , i don &apos;t remember you asking me to do this work .
um , when did you call ?
about a month ago .
did we talk ?
no , you were out.your assistant sent me on to ...
louis canning ?
no , david something .
oh , david lee .
yeah , that &apos;s it . funny guy .
he said he &apos;d give you the message .
well , anyway , thank you so much .
pauline , you can go home now . you &apos;re fired .
the e @-@ mails are anonymous ,
but there is a message at the bottom of each of them :
&quot; prepare to be amazed . &quot; it &apos;s a signature of some kind .
you &apos;re seeing if you can find it anywhere else on the web ?
yeah , somewhere unprotected .
good . i need something else .
you said you could help me when i needed it .
could you find out if moves are being made against me ?
moves ?
it might be nothing ,
but my assistant was sending client calls
on to canning and david lee .
well , that sounds like something .
yes , it does .
but i want to know what before i act .
good .
you seem ... different , diane .
different ? i do ?
different good or different bad ?
different good .
kalinda , i feel like i &apos;m channeling will &apos;s ghost .
well , then take care of him .
what &apos;s next , zach ?
pull out the wire furthest to the right .
not the high one , the low one .
that &apos;s closest to the blue light .
what blue light ?
is the tv on ?
yes .
okay , so click the remote on and off ,
and you should see a blue light .
no , nothing &apos;s happening .
mom , which remote are you using ?
the silver one .
no , use the other one .
which one ?
the black one .
zach , they &apos;re all black .
the black one with a million buttons .

kim , can you get mrs. florrick &apos;s scarf ?

mom ? mom , mom , are you still there ?
you know , actually , i think i can make it .
no . uh , something just dropped through .
good . i &apos;ll see you there .
wow , you really are bored .
alicia .
i &apos;m so sorry .
thank you , mom .
will was such a special person .
he made me laugh .
thank you .
do you want me to shut up ?
no . what do you mean ?
oh , the way you said thank you .
after your father died , at one point ,
i was just all cried out ,
and i just wanted people to shut up .
no , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s just ...
come on .
sit down .
it &apos;s just what ?
it &apos;s unreal .
like he &apos;s ...
like he &apos;s still there , you know ?
or ... that he was never there at all .
i know .
that &apos;s the worst part ,
when you can &apos;t remember what they look like .
the thing to do is pray .
pray ?
yeah .
talk to him . talk to will .
he &apos;ll listen . he may not answer , but ...
there &apos;ll be things in the middle of the day
that seem like he &apos;s answering , you know ?
a balloon in the sky ,
a leaf falling from a tree .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing with my life , mom .
just working seems pointless .
you &apos;re smart .
you &apos;re gonna figure it out .
i don &apos;t know if i want to be a lawyer anymore .
then what are you gonna be ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s not about what i want to be , it &apos;s ...
i don &apos;t know if i can ...
hey ! there you are , veronica !
hi .
i thought we said 1 : 30 ?
i got off early , so ...
hi . logan .
this is my daughter , alicia .
logan wanted to join us for lunch .
you look beautiful .
oh ! come on !
actually , i have to get back to work .
i got a text and i &apos;m a little late .
no , no , no , stay , stay .
no , they need me at work , mom .
nice to meet you , logan .
what are you doing ?
you , too .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
oh , god .
alicia florrick .
i thought that was you .
did you get on another jury ?
no , i just , um , i thought i left something in court .
my wallet .
oh . did you find it ?
no , uh , not yet .
i @-@ i might @-@ might have left it at work .
well , you want to hit lunch ?
90 minutes .
he &apos;s worried about what you think of him .
did he do these reviews for money ?
and the adventure .
he &apos;s a good boy .
he &apos;s very embarrassed .
and if he turns on these ...
these silk road people ,
will he be in danger ?
the police don &apos;t think so .
these buyers and sellers on the internet
tend to be pretty innocuous .
you &apos;ll keep him safe .
diane , can we talk ?
i &apos;ll try .
you fired pauline .
my assistant ? yes . why ?
she wasn &apos;t doing anything wrong .
what are we talking about here ?
she sent your client calls on to me
because i asked her to .
i also asked her not to tell you .
and why did you do that , david ?
you &apos;ve been missing things
since will died .
you have been missing meetings ,
uh , you haven &apos;t been returning calls ,
clients are starting to comment .
which clients ?
uh , you &apos;ve been coming in later ,
people are saying you &apos;re not answering
your cell ... which clients ?
roger lux .
vito conning . i @-@ i did it as a favor , diane .
i @-@ i wasn &apos;t trying to horn in on your business .
i did this work without any credit .
i @-@ i @-@ i said it was you .
thank you , david .
okay .
it &apos;s the last nice thing i do .
from now on , take up your own slack .
here and here . see ?
the sender from silk road had a phrase :
&quot; prepare to be amazed . &quot;
now , we can &apos;t trace these e @-@ mails back ,
but robbie was hired
because of his reviews on amazon ,
and so we scanned the reviews
and we found this .
it &apos;s a review of an ayn rand book ,
and there it is again : &quot; prepare to be amazed . &quot;
this one has an ip address .
one year probation . no jail time .
with a conviction .
jeremy barba .
he &apos;s a local .
jeremy barba ? police .
mr. barba , we have a warrant to search your apartment .
damn it .
is that him ?
is that jeremy barba ?
yeah .
kalinda , why do people let you into crime scenes ?
oh , you know .
cops like me .
how well did you know her ?
corsica ?
she was nice to me .
she named you to the police .
she was in trouble .
robbie ...
we think she may be connected
to this man &apos;s death .
when i questioned corsica ,
she said she didn &apos;t know anybody at silk road ,
and yet her pot label was found at the crime scene .
they &apos;re not honoring the plea bargain , robbie .
we need something on corsica .
how many times did you meet her ?
just that once .
and did you bring up silk road , or did she ?
i don &apos;t remember .
now listen to me :
either this woman corsica is setting you up ,
or you run silk road .
because that &apos;s what the police are thinking right now .
so you help us , or you go to jail .
but those are your options .
robbie , you need to help them .
i ... i set up the cloud for her computer .
so , the governor &apos;s wife .
yep .
and what &apos;s that like ?
clarifying .
are we being too loud ?
no .
what is that card ? who &apos;s that for ?
oh , it &apos;s , uh , for my kid . anthony .
oh , how old ?
he &apos;s 14 .
well , now 15 .
he &apos;s amazing . he &apos;s , uh ...
he writes these little stories .
th @-@ they &apos;re like new yorker stories .
you have kids ?
yeah . two .
a boy and a girl .
16 and 18 .
16 and 18 ?
when &apos;d you have &apos; em , when you were 12 ?
well , i &apos;m glad you came along , alicia .
i thought this day was just gonna be a waste .
you all right ?
will you excuse me ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
just tell him you have to go .
i &apos;m so stupid .
thank you .
oh , no ...
oh , no . well , no , let &apos;s ... at least split it .
let me pay .
thought you lost your wallet .
my other wallet .
alicia , look , i , uh ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t have friends .
i work a lot and i &apos;m private ,
so what i &apos;m about to say doesn &apos;t ...
doesn &apos;t mean anything .
i mean , anything serious .
jury duty takes me till 6 : 30 .
i was planning on coming back here and just
getting a drink .
meet me here at 7 : 00 .
okay ? just a drink , nothing more .
i can &apos;t .
eh , you can .
i know you &apos;re married .
and you have kids , and ...
and i &apos;m not into getting tangled up either ,
but i still want to have a drink with you .
why ?
because i like you .
i think you &apos;re funny .
i &apos;d want a drink with you if you were a man ,
or a chimpanzee , or ...
all right . let &apos;s leave it at this :
i &apos;m coming back here at 7 : 00 .
they have a great wine list .
if you &apos;re here , i &apos;ll be very happy .
if you &apos;re not ,
i &apos;ll be less happy .
but then , this was a nice lunch .
i have to go .
but your credit card-- she hasn &apos;t taken it yet .
i &apos;ll pay . you go .
okay . thanks .
remember , 7 : 00 .
i &apos;m finn polmar ,
and i &apos;m running for cook county state &apos;s attorney
because i think the office is currently being mismanaged .
in what way mismanaged ?
james castro is a good man , but ...
he &apos;s not a good man .
what does that mean , &quot; a good man &quot; ?
james castro is a friend of mine ...
nobody cares .
what can you do for me ?
stop serving political interests
and convict criminals .
are political interests being served ?
yes , for the past three years ...
no .
governor florrick was state &apos;s attorney for two of those years .
but it &apos;s the truth .
you &apos;re under the impression this interview &apos;s about the truth ?
for the past year ,
the office has been mired in ...
good .
tell me about being shot .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
the interview is to introduce you .
tell me about being shot .
i was in court .
a defendant took a sheriff &apos;s gun ,
killed a witness
and then tried to shoot himself .
and you &apos;re already back in court , prosecuting cases ?
it &apos;s my job .
good . people say you &apos;re a hero .
do we have to do this ?
no one will remember your five @-@ point plan .
they &apos;ll remember a hero trying to save a dying man .
i ... i wasn &apos;t the hero .
will gardner was the hero .
when jeffrey grant started shooting ,
he tried to , uh , take the gun .
good . good . say that .
that ... will was the hero ?
humility .
a hero doesn &apos;t brag , he deflects .
but he still has to describe .
people need to hear the horror .
do you have some comment to make , mr. polmar ?
that &apos;s the reason the governor &apos;s endorsing me , the shooting ?
no . the governor &apos;s endorsing you because he doesn &apos;t like castro .
i am establishing your value through the shooting .
if society valued kindness and a good haircut ,
i &apos;d establish that .
hi , diane . what do you need ?
corsica ? what did you find out ?
i gotta go .
the interview &apos;s at 6 : 00 . be on time .
yeah .
what ?
jeremy barba is dead .
you know who that is ?
you said that you didn &apos;t know any other names connected with silk road .
i didn &apos;t want to get him in trouble .
what happened ?
he was murdered .
oh , my god .
you know , there are a lot of , uh , services sold on silk road .
smuggling , kidnapping ...
also murder for hire .
it was robbie .
he &apos;s trying to get rid of anybody who can hurt him .
or you are .
recognize this ?
why ?
and these ?
i don &apos;t know them .
these photos were found in your cloud account .
and there was an encrypted e @-@ mail to one of the hit men .
well , i &apos;m being set up .
you have to believe me .
ms. dinnerstein , you &apos;re under arrest .
it &apos;s robbie .
it &apos;s not me .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say ...
she &apos;s lying .
she said i was setting her up ?
yes .
this is insane .
who is this girl ?
it &apos;s her cloud account .
she left evidence at the scene .
she said that you created and ran silk road .
that you were worried about jeremy barba
turning on you if you were arrested ,
and that you used your bitcoin to hire someone to kill him .
and the cloud account ?
that robbie had access to it , so he could &apos;ve planted it there .
so ...
is there an arrest on the horizon , mr. polmar ?
i &apos;ve arrested ms. dinnerstein .
but i might need robbie &apos;s help to testify against her .
you asked to see us ?
are we being scolded ?
you need to stop courting my clients .
we &apos;re not courting anyone , diane .
you need to take better care of them .
no , david .
that won &apos;t work with me .
what won &apos;t ?
trying to make me think it &apos;s my fault .
kalinda ...
you have met on eight separate occasions
outside of work in the last two weeks .
we like each other .
you don &apos;t like anyone , david .
you also requested records of billable hours and partner compensation .
so , what would you conclude from that , alicia ?
uh ... diane ?
you &apos;re isolating me .
you &apos;re gaslighting me .
you &apos;re trying to take over the managerial spot .
tell her .
you sure ?
yeah .
we &apos;ve been estate planning .
that &apos;s why we met eight times outside the office .
actually , i think it was nine . my assistant gets things wrong .
estate planning ?
what , are you two getting married ?
i &apos;m dying .
doctors gave me 12 months to live . i have , uh ...
children and @-@ and a wife ,
and i need to get my affairs in order .
that &apos;s why the urgency of the estate planning .
that &apos;s why i came here .
i wanted to ... have a home .
have somewhere i could make amends .
how long have you known this ?
two months .
i really don &apos;t want anyone else to know
and i @-@ i don &apos;t want any pity
and i @-@ i don &apos;t want anyone crying .
i @-@ i just ...
do me that kindness .
i @-@ i will .
i &apos;m sorry .
it has to happen to all of us .
he &apos;s a good guy .
you believe him ?
i did , until he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want pity . &quot;
you want me to find out ?
yep .
sex ...
is a chimera .
i saw a crack whore eat her own arm .
i saw a baby drowned like a cat .
sex ...
just keeps us occupied .
because reality can &apos;t be endured .
even this will end in smoke .
i didn &apos;t know he &apos;d get there so early .
i thought we &apos;d have more time for lunch .
hi , mom .
what are you doing ?
i have no idea what i &apos;m doing .
well , whatever it is , i &apos;m gonna do it with you .
yes , for the last 12 months
the office has been mired in sloth and politics .
let &apos;s talk about the event of december 20 .
yes , that was terrible .
and in your own words , what happened ?
well , a defendant took a sheriff &apos;s gun
killed a witness ,
芬恩 · 波尔马 英雄参加竞选
and then tried to shoot himself .
did you think you &apos;d make it out alive ?
come on . come on .
well , there really wasn &apos;t time to think .
a man was in front of me , bleeding .
this was , uh , the opposing attorney ?
yes , he &apos;d been shot .
and you were trying to cover him ,
even though you were wounded ?
come on , come on . you can do it .
mandy , i &apos;m sorry .
will gardner was the hero .
i was just lucky .
yes .
why is that ?
he tried to get the gun away from jeffrey grant .
i just , uh ...
you just ... tried to protect will ?
i wish i &apos;d done more .
this wasn &apos;t your first brush with tragedy ,
was it , mr. polmar ?
your sister , leah , committed suicide a few years ago
after a long battle with drug addiction .
it &apos;ll be three years in june , yes .
i understand your family took a &quot; tough love &quot; approach ,
refusing to help her those final days .
what are you doing ? trying to blindside us ?
as any family who &apos;s dealt with drug addiction knows ,
you try everything ,
because you desperately want to save them .
rehab , psychiatrists , interventions
and yes , tough love .
would you say this was an instance
where tough love ... failed ?
drug addiction is an insidious disease .
i think the hardest lesson for all of us
was knowing that no matter what we did to help ,
ultimately it wasn &apos;t up to us .
good .
good .
how did she know about leah ?
i don &apos;t know .
probably castro .
you did well .
no , i didn &apos;t .
i should &apos;ve told her to go to hell .
that &apos;s when you know you &apos;re a true politician--
when you don &apos;t .
you didn &apos;t deserve this , norma jean .
you called me .
no .
it was owen .
oh , right .
he @-@ he called us both ,
because he was ... he was staying at dad &apos;s that weekend .
oh , you &apos;re right .
owen started crying .
&quot; dad is dead . &quot; oh ... i remember .
i couldn &apos;t catch my breath .
i just couldn &apos;t breathe .
oh , i thought he &apos;d live forever .
i thought he &apos;d live longer than you .
god , he was strong as an ox , wasn &apos;t he ?
i always thought you two would get back together .
oh , we tried .
some people are just better at being friends .
why are you looking at your watch ?
are you afraid the kids are gonna come home
and see us both drunk ?
i &apos;m not drunk .
then why are you looking at your watch ?
it &apos;s on my wrist .
i &apos;m like him , aren &apos;t i ?
what do you mean ?
stuck being the good one .
he talked about work .
how he &apos;d always stay late cleaning up after everyone .
dad said there are people who make the mess ...
and people who clean up .
and you two are the cleaners .
i don &apos;t know what i am anymore .
nothing &apos;s as simple as it used to be .
what &apos;s going on , alicia ?
i &apos;m spinning , mom .
i can &apos;t stop .
i shouldn &apos;t have stopped working .
oh , honey ,
you &apos;re just hurting .
i &apos;m so sorry you have to go through this .
i don &apos;t know what to do , mom .
oh , sweetheart .
shh , shh , no , no , no .
oh , baby , nobody does .
anything on canning ?
diane ...
if i had information that would make you withdraw
as robbie &apos;s attorney , would you want it ?
yes .
i was looking at e @-@ mails from corsica &apos;s cloud storage .
this is an e @-@ mail request for jeremy barba &apos;s murder .
she told him that she wanted to purchase something from him ,
非常紧急 手脚干净麻利点
except she wrote &quot; perches , &quot; like the fish .
it &apos;s an autocorrect glitch .
no . &quot; purchase &quot; isn &apos;t spelling anything like the fish .
but they do sound alike .
voice recognition software .
yeah .
it &apos;s a speech recognition glitch .
and it &apos;s the same mistake that shows up
four times in robbie &apos;s reviews on silk road .
it looks like robbie did set up corsica .
well , that &apos;s not good .
finn ...
my apologies , but ...
something &apos;s come up .
i &apos;m gonna have to withdraw myself from this case .
really ? why is that ?
there &apos;s a conflict . that &apos;s all i &apos;m able to say .
i &apos;m sorry .
what &apos;s going on , diane ?
i &apos;m referring the pollards to another law firm .
thanks for coming over here .
hey , alicia .
you got a minute ?
i do . how are you doing ?
oh , it &apos;s been a long day .
here , too .
look , i &apos;m on a case .
lockhart / gardner &apos;s on the other side .
or was .
diane just withdrew herself from the case for no reason .
now , is that like her ?
well ...
do you feel comfortable discussing this ?
yes . i ... it &apos;s not like her .
the clients are her friends , the pollards .
oh , i know them .
the grandson .
no , i don &apos;t know him .
is there a chance the client intends to perjure himself ?
well , i can &apos;t say for certain , but
it would be one reason why diane would back out .
she would never suborn perjury .
okay . thanks .
hey ... sounds like you &apos;re on the street .
you all right ?
i had the ... had a day off .
sounds good .
uh , did eli get ahold of you ?
yeah .
yeah ...
he wants to turn me into a hero .
yes .
eli is good at that .
that &apos;s right .
he already turned you into a saint .
yep .
talk to you later .
this is a betrayal .
it &apos;s better for robbie that i do .
how can you just withdraw ?
it &apos;s best for robbie that i do .
why ? tell me why .
i can &apos;t .
diane , you &apos;re abandoning us .
my apologies .
oh , thank you ! that @-@ that &apos;s very helpful .
sounded like it went poorly .
not great .
do you have something ?
yeah .
on canning ?
yes .
so is he dying ?
or is he trying to screw me ?
he is dying ...
and he &apos;s trying to screw you .
it &apos;s one drink . why is that a problem ?
who am i being faithful to ?
