第一季 第十三集
unless you want dear nathaniel to know how
you lost your virginity to me in the back of a moving vehicle ,
i encourage patience and restraint .
isn &apos;t there someone else you can torture ?
if you &apos;re ready to forgive me , nothing can tear us apart .
i love you , nate archibald .
are we really gonna do this ? yeah .
do you like me ? define &quot; like . &quot;
what &apos;s the difference between gossip and scandal ?
so glad you asked , ues forever .
anyone can commit a minor indiscretion
and generate a day &apos;s worth of buzz ,
but in order for gossip to birth a true scandal ,
it requires the right person to be in the wrong place .
take one &quot; it &quot; girl on a pedestal .
which one do you recommend ?
add a crowd eager to see her fall
and give them the means to knock her down .
i can &apos;t believe this. oh , my god .
dan !
what ? what ? what ? you okay ? no .
i &apos;fine.euh , i was just testing my screaming
to see its screaming efficiency. well , dad ,
now i &apos;d like to kill her , please. what are you hiding ?
nothing , dad , stop. you &apos;re invading my privacy. this is a loft .
no , stop. you guys .
dan , you &apos;re gonna be really sorry you did that .
jenny , would you excuse us ?
is there something you want to tell me ?
am i that obvious ? yes , actually .
that hair color is all wrong for you .
that &apos;s funny .
this isn &apos;t .
please say something .
a @-@ anything would be better than this
&quot; i am so disappointed in you &quot; silence .
since the time you could walk ,
your mother and i-- we knew you were special .
you were very smart , very talented ,
and we promised each other we would do whatever it took
to give you a bright future ,
and that did not include you becoming a teenage father .
dad , this wasn &apos;t a part of the my plan ,
seriously , not a part of the plan
but whatever serena decides to do ,
i @-@ i @-@ i want to be there for her .
i @-@ i have to be there for her .
i love her .
dan ... i do .
i do , whether she &apos;s pregnant , whether she &apos;s not pregnant ...
i @-@ i love her .
first things first . i think you need to talk to her .
maybe it &apos;s not even true. did you hear what i just said ?
i heard you , and i hope you heard what i said .
hey , mom .
yes , i &apos;m pregnant , and it &apos;s yours .
hey . i &apos;ve been calling you every two seconds for the past hour .
oh , i left my cell at home. i @-@ i kinda had a lot on my mind .
i know , and i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry--
no , wait , wait , wait. me first .
i &apos;m sorry that you didn &apos;t feel that you could tell me ,
and no matter what you decide , i want you to know
that i &apos;m here for you because i @-@ i @-@ i--because i love you. dan ,
i &apos;m not pregnant ,
so you don &apos;t have to say that . i mean , you don &apos;t have to ,
because , um , i get it. you would have done the right thing .
um , thank you , though. that-- that &apos;s--that &apos;s really sweet .
of course
yeah ,
well , hey , that &apos;s good news-- the no baby part .
it &apos;s really good news , like my @-@ dad &apos;s @-@ probably @-@ gonna-
throw @-@ a @-@ party @-@ good news. your dad ? look , can we actually talk later ?
i &apos;m late to meet blair. she &apos;s on the steps of the met .
oh , yeah , no , go. go , go. it can wait ,
unlike blair , who &apos;s waiting on the steps , right ? exactly. yeah .
okay , i &apos;ll talk to you later. okay , all right .
her new line was fabulous .
hi !
jenny , hi. you &apos;re late .
yeah , i know . i had to drop some books off at the library. sorry .
would you do me a favor ? anything .
move down a couple steps .
you know , this whole hazing thing is getting a bit old ,
don &apos;t you think , b . ? first of all , the hazing stops when i say it stops .
and for future reference , only my friends call me &quot; b . &quot;
you know , i &apos;m actually gonna go .
i have a lot of stuff to do before class . jenny .
please , she &apos;ll be back .
hey , you .
hey , guys. hey .
i &apos;m not pregnant .
aw , cool. congratulations .
celebratory drinks after school ?
yeah , sure . blair , can i talk to you ?
of course .
excuse me .
did you get my text ? of course. yes , i did , but i &apos;ve been--
so then you know i told dan i &apos;m not pregnant .
yes , and i am so happy for you. close call , huh ?
are we really gonna play that old game , b . ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
whenever something happens that &apos;s not a part of your plan ,
you pretend like it doesn &apos;t exist .
you act like you &apos;re in this movie about your perfect life ,
then i have to remind you ,
the only one watching that movie is you .
you admitted that your period was late. yes , i &apos;ve been very stressed .
i had that chem test on friday .
and you &apos;re acting like a total bitch
because you &apos;re not hormonal ? maybe i am a total bitch .
did you ever think about that ?
just take the test , b .
stop it .
just take the test .
you need to know if you and chuck are gonna have a baby .
and for a scandal to really blow up ,
all it needs is an unexpected turn .
would you do me a really big favor ?
what is it , sweetie ?
i need you to come with me to visit my dad in rehab .
please .
really ?
yeah , it &apos;s just--
it gets really awaward when i have to go alone now ,
and i don &apos;t know what to say anymore .
he loves you. you always know how to make him laugh .
nathaniel archibald ,
you have never asked me for anything ,
and here you are , officially leaning on me .
this time we &apos;re gonna be so much better together .
we already are .
well , at least now you know. know what ? that i &apos;ve wasted half the year
trying to be friends with someone
that &apos;s never going to like me ? uh , yeah. that &apos;s exactly it .
hey. guys. so ...
dad .
you &apos;re not gonna be a grandfather .
that &apos;s cool .
that &apos;s really cool .
yes , yes , yes .
yes !
and i thought i was relieved. it &apos;s not all good news , though .
i @-@ i told her i love her , and she thinks i only said that
because i thought she was pregnant. well , son ,
that &apos;s probably a good thing .
gives you a minute to step back and enjoy being 17 .
you two were moving a bit too fast anyway .
i &apos;m late for the gallery , but we can talk more later .
wow . i &apos;ve never seen you give up so easily .
can you not start with me ? can you not be so easy to start with ?
why are you taking his advice ? he &apos;s old and alone. what ?
tell serena again without the pregnancy scare ,
in a quiet , no distractions kind of way .
but then again , what do i know about romance ,
friends or anything else ? no , no , no , no , no .
actually , jen , that &apos;s-- that &apos;s a very good idea .
oh , right .
what would you do without me ?
promise me i will find out one day .
hey , b .
what are you doing here ? in the neighborhood .
can we talk later ? despite your best efforts to ruin it ,
i &apos;m actually having a good day , and i don &apos;t want anything
to spoil it. guess who asked me to visit the captain with him ?
i don &apos;t know . nate ?
yes. it &apos;s like he finally needs me and isn &apos;t afraid to-- look , b . ,
i understand why you &apos;re reluctant
to burst your happy bubble , but i &apos;m not giving up. well , i &apos;m sorry ,
if unlike some people ,
i haven &apos;t been on the pill since i was 15. okay , i am giving up .
before you start planning your perfect night with nate ,
don &apos;t you think you should-- i &apos;m not pregnant , serena .
what &apos;s wrong ? was it something i cooked ?
no. no , no , no . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s honestly the best spaghetti i &apos;ve ever tasted .
thank you , even if i did have to drag it out of you myself .
hey , guys .
hey , jenny .
go back to your room , jenny .
i &apos;m just getting juice .
excuse me .
hey , jen. could you do me a favor
and drink your juice at vanessa &apos;s , maybe ?
i &apos;m going back to my room , closing the door ,
putting on my headphones and ignoring you and your date. excellent .
thank you .
where were we ?
well , let--let &apos;s try this .
why don &apos;t you tell me what &apos;s on your mind ?
then it can be on our minds ,
and our minds can worry about what &apos;s on your mind , together .
i have no idea what you just said .
i don &apos;t know what i said either , but , um ,
what i &apos;m saying now is talk to me .
i never thought i was pregnant .
the test was for blair. oh , wait , wait . i &apos;m confused .
she just got back together with nate .
so ... oh. then who ?
chuck .
chuck ?
and blair ?
blair and chuck ?
then why isn &apos;t he the one buying the test ? because ...
because he &apos;s an ass. who doesn &apos;t know .
why not ?
i mean , there &apos;s no love lost between me and chuck bass ,
but i gotta believe he--he deserves to know .
he--he does have this weird influence over her .
maybe he could talk her into taking the test .
i just-- i &apos;m so worried about her .
come here .
this may be the most amazing purchase you &apos;ll ever make
in your entire lovely existence. your day almost over ?
not quite . i &apos;ve got a few canvases to wrap
and a little more paperwork .
i &apos;m trying to get you to ask me out for after @-@ work drinks .
oh , oh. uh , okay .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t realize ,
i guess you &apos;re not done for the day after all ,
but when you are , call me .
hi , rufus. remember me ?
bex , right ? art dealer .
yeah , you bought a very special piece
for lily van der woodsen .
i &apos;m looking for some things for a couple other clients .
any new discoveries since the last time i was here ? a few .
there &apos;s a beautiful mixed media piece on this wall over here .
as i recall , you had a wife in hudson .
that still true ?
uh , she &apos;s still there . i &apos;m still here .
made things a little difficult .
still trying ?
i &apos;m trying to move on .
hmm. tomorrow night too soon to start ?
i suppose not .
sounds good .
okay .
hi , chuck .
please , call me &quot; brother . &quot;
i need to talk to you .
about getting knocked up ? i must say
i was a little disappointed you weren &apos;t more careful .
chuck , i really need to trust you .
i &apos;m hoping that deep down inside ,
you &apos;re actually a decent person
and won &apos;t make me regret this .
you &apos;re here for blair , aren &apos;t you ?
look , i &apos;m not going to tell nate about us .
i tortured her , got bored and moved on .
there &apos;s no moving on just yet .
the pregnancy test wasn &apos;t for me. it was for blair .
what ? she won &apos;t take it .
so given that if she &apos;s pregnant , you &apos;re the-- no , we used a condom .
well , obviously , it broke. what is obvious
is that your best friend has kept you in the dark .
what are you talking about ? like i said ,
i handle my business. apparently , nate doesn &apos;t .
they slept together just after we did .
it &apos;s him you should be asking for help .
hey , dad .
i need to talk to to you about something .
whoa , whoa , whoa. it &apos;s a little early in the morning
for the teens @-@ gone @-@ wild contingency plan , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s not about your relationship with serena. oh. oh , then what ?
i need to know how you and jenny would feel
if i went out tonight for a drink ... with a woman .
well , i guess i feel like you shouldn &apos;t wear that shirt ,
or there will not be a second date .
really ? r @-@ really .
thanks .
now i guess i just have to worry about jenny then .
good morning. hi .
good morning , sunshine .
dad , where &apos;d you get that shirt ?
what &apos;s wrong with this shirt ? nothing ,
as long as you don &apos;t plan to wear it out of the house .
it &apos;s worse. he plans on wearing it on a date .
for drinks , if that &apos;s okay. whatever. it &apos;s awful .
guess you have your answer. answer to what ?
nothing. nothing .
morning .
good morning , miss serena .
anybody notice the weather today ? what ?
take a look outside , b. my first response
would be that the sky is a clear blue easy .
dorota , you may be excused now .
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t tell me about you and nate .
what did he say ? noing . chuck did , when i went to see him
because i thought maybe he could talk some sense into you .
you had no right to do that . i was trying to help you , b .
i took a public bullet for you ,
let another rumor about me run rampant .
the whole school heard , even dan .
what &apos;s going on ?
ask blair. her version of the story &apos;s always better .
fine .
you all right ?
never been better .
well , serena has. what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t be held responsible for her mood swings .
were you arguing
about the possibility
that your condition may have returned ?
no. and it hasn &apos;t .
i heard you ...
the other day ,
in your bathroom , with the water running .
i &apos;m very stressed .
and with you and serena down my throat ,
i can hardly think straight , never mind keep food down .
maybe you do just need to take a little bak , , h ?
visit your father ? lyon is beautiful this time of year. maybe this summer .
summer sounds great. finish your breakfast .
i &apos;m not pregnant .
i command myself not to be pregnant .
hello ? hey , s. it &apos;s b .
two things .
first ... i &apos;m sorry
about dan , about the &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast
and about not telling you about nate. okay .
you were just so hard on me about chuck .
i didn &apos;t want to be judged for sleeping with them both .
i understand. apology accepted .
that was fast. if i were you ,
i would &apos;ve made me work for it a little bit harder .
well , i think you &apos;ve suffered enough. and second thing--
wait. that &apos;s already , like , three things . i took the test .
i &apos;m not pregnant .
aah ! oh , my gosh ! are you kidding me ?
oh , i am so happy .
i would have had no idea what to wear to a paternity hearing. clean slate ?
oh , clean slate. oh , i &apos;m so happy .
see you at school .
oh , don &apos;t stop on my account. oh , i have to .
secondhand smoke is bad for the , uh ... i &apos;m not pregnant , so good @-@ bye ,
mistake so far in my past i can hardly remember .
you cannot be serious. you can &apos;t be touching me .
look , if you were gonna tell nate ,
you would have done so in monaco ,
but you don &apos;t want him to hate you , and you know he would .
game over. game &apos;s not over until i say it is .
then have fun playing with yourself .
gg . s not pregnant , covering for blair
same blair whose sheets were rumpled
by two guys in one week
send to gossip girl
got &apos; em .
are--are--are you cold ? i &apos;m okay .
it &apos;s pretty cold. here , let me get you this blanket .
this will be better to keep you warm .
um , you--you want some ginger ale ?
here . i brought this for us .
we can have a nice little drink .
um , it might be a little cold , actually .
i--you okay ? you &apos;re doing that , um ... thing .
yeah , i @-@ i know . i &apos;m sorry. i ...
it &apos;s just ... i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
in--in the short time we &apos;ve known each other ,
you--you &apos;ve become really important to me .
i &apos;ve been struggling to find a way to tell you ,
struggling now .
oh , my lit paper. no , no , no , no , no .
oh ! no , no , no , no , no , no .
oh , my gosh. here you go .
i love you. thank you .
no problem. all right , take care .
that was a close call .
i &apos;m sorry. that would &apos;ve completely ruined our picnic .
yeah .
okay , what , um , what was it you were saying ?
oh , just ...
i think i should proofread this for you. can i ?
sure. yeah , but can we eat first ? &apos; cause i &apos;m starving .
yeah. let &apos;s eat .
can you believe this ?
jenny , come look at this .
looks like the virgin queen
isn &apos;t as pure as she pretended to be .
who &apos;s your daddy , b . ? baby daddy , that is .
two guys in one week ? talk about doing the nasty ,
or should i just say being nasty ?
oh , my god. you know she &apos;s right about this .
oh , god , there she is. what a total hypocrite .
who does she think she is ?
pot calling the kettle black much ?
i never thought she was a virgin anyway .
oh , i can see a bump ! what a bitch .
oh , my god , she is such a whore .
try keeping your legs closed for a change , blair .
she cheated on nate ? ! does nate know ?
have you seen nate ?
no .
i saw it .
yeah , blair &apos;s gonna freak out . i mean , this is a total lie .
yeah .
of course it is .
jenny , look , i know you &apos;re friends with blair ,
and you &apos;d never want to do anything to betray her ,
but if you know something ... well , blair was never really my friend .
so ...
so ...
yeah , there &apos;s something you should know .
i don &apos;t know if you would want to her ...
did you sleep with her , huh ?
you son of a bitch . i could kill you .
can we talk about this without your hands around my neck ?
what &apos;d you do ? did you get what you wanted ,
like you do with all those other girls ? yes , nathaniel . i took what blair
kept throwing at you and you kept throwing back .
oh , so somehow you screwing blair for sport is my fault ?
it wasn &apos;t for sport. she needed someone , and i was there .
oh , so you cared about her ?
you guys were broken up. what , for how long ? a week ? an hour ?
look , i am sorry , all right ?
i know how long you and i have been best friends , okay ?
no , it &apos;s not okay , chuck .
from now on , you stay away from me . nate .
did you hear what i said ?
you stay the hell away from me , chuck !
show &apos;s over .
what are you doing here ? your mom let me in .
i didn &apos;t ask how you got in . i asked why you came .
to talk .... about us .
there &apos;s no &quot; us , &quot; blair .
yes , there is. we finally really have a chance to start over .
you know , all this time , i felt so b for everything i &apos;ve done ,
and when you said you wanted to leave the past in the past ,
i didn &apos;t know we were talking about your past .
you had just broken my heart .
i made a decision i was in no condition to make .
but you &apos;re clear @-@ headed now , right ?
yes. then you &apos;ll understand perfectly when i say
i want nothing else to do with you , blair .
you and chuck deserve each other. you know chuck would say anything ,
twist the truth .
but jenny wouldn &apos;t . jenny ?
and don &apos;t go blaming any of this on her , blair .
i would have found out eventually . i said i &apos;m done .
it &apos;s over. now would you please leave ?
fine. stay as long as you like . i &apos;ll leave .
bryn. hi .
good to see you again .
rufus , at the risk of being forward ,
i &apos;m here on a dare from my friends to ask you out .
then i guess i have to say , uh ...
yes ? yes , you do .
well , tonight , i have plans , but maybe some other night ...
am i interrupting ?
hi .
uh , bryn , bex . bex , bryn .
actually , i &apos;m bex. she must be ... bryn .
i always get a little tongue @-@ tied with my b &apos;s .
looks like you &apos;re still tied up .
maybe we should reschedule drinks. no , that-- that won &apos;t be necessary .
actually , i think it will. good to meet you , bryn .
you , too. bye .
guess you &apos;re available after all .
hey , b. what &apos;s up ?
i can &apos;t believe you told jenny about me and chuck .
what ? i @-@ i didn &apos;t .
because of her , everybody knows the intimate details
of my private life , and now nate &apos;s not speaking to me. but i @-@ i told you ,
b.
i didn &apos;t tell jenny . i don &apos;t know how she found out. did you tell dan ?
what ?
you did. you told your low @-@ rent boyfriend ,
and he told his social @-@ climbing sister
who wears my hand @-@ me @-@ downs , and she blabbed to nate .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re attacking dan and jenny .
did you or did you not tell him ?
i did ,
but only because you weren &apos;t dealing with it ,
and i wanted advice on how to help you . i can &apos;t believe you don &apos;t get it .
the rules are different
for the serena van der woodsens of the world .
people expect you to party and be wild ,
sleep with whoever you want , run away , come back. wait ,
are we really going back there ?
you shot your reputation to hell a long time ago .
it doesn &apos;t matter what you do , but i &apos;m a waldorf. well ,
since you and your reputation
obviously don &apos;t need me and my low @-@ rent taste ,
you and the waldorf name can weather the storm alone .
with pleasure .
hey , jenny .
hi .
are you joining us ? um ...
what are you doing here ? i was just leaving .
no , stay .
blair , given you can barely manage your own messy affairs ,
surely you &apos;re not in a position to tell anyone
where they can and can &apos;t eat. do you realize who you &apos;re talking to ?
you mean a self @-@ righteous bitch who always sat
on her own high horse judging everyone else ? pregnant little hypocrite .
not that it &apos;s any of your business ,
but i &apos;m not pregnant .
nate must be thrilled . chuck , too .
what are you talking about ?
the whole school saw them throwing down
over your cheap ass .
the boyfriend and the best friend ? pretty classy .
consider yourself dethroned ,
queen b .
jenny
it is highly unlikely
that i will ever forgive you for going to nate ,
but if you walk away from me now ,
i will also ruin you .
how are you gonna do that ?
good to see you again .
okay. bye. take care. enjoy .
hi. it &apos;s bex. you know what to do .
hi. it &apos;s rufus ,
calling again to apologize about last night again .
i really didn &apos;t mean to insult you or disrespect you
or whatever it is i did .
i &apos;m new at this , and well ...
i &apos;m new at this .
you told jenny about blair and chuck ?
no. no , of course not .
well , you &apos;re the only one i told .
and i didn &apos;t tell anybody .
how can i know that ?
because i gave you my word .
because i love you .
what ?
i love you ,
and not just because i thought you were pregnant
and not in the way you love
some random guy who picks up your lit paper
or some girl who likes your hair .
okay .
&quot; okay &quot; ?
that response is not okay .
i &apos;m such an ass. let me guess . dan ?
he told me loved me ,
and all i did was stand there like a stupid mute .
i mean , why wouldn &apos;t i want to hear those words
come out of his mouth ? but it &apos;s like it made me trust him less ,
which is crazy , and even if he is lying about telling jenny ,
even though i told him not to tell anyone ,
i should have come up with a better response to &quot; i love you .
&quot; not that i even know what you &apos;re talking about ,
but why would you think he was lying ? because i &apos;m the only one who knew ,
and he &apos;s the only one i told .
do you know how many times i was listening in
on your conversations when you thought i wasn &apos;t ? ooh. none , i hope .
you hope wrong . i &apos;m a little brother .
it &apos;s what i do , and you don &apos;t have to be a genius
to figure out the trust thing . i mean , every time
mom brought home someone who said , &quot; i love you , &quot;
they would end up married. and then divorced .
didn &apos;t leave us with a strong sense of trust , huh ?
but that &apos;s mom &apos;s issue , not ours ,
and dan &apos;s not one of those guys .
okay , this conversation has to end ,
because you &apos;re getting dangerously close
to being smarter than i am ,
no , thank you. all right .
i came to congratulate you in person .
you ruined my relationship with nate ,
serena , all of my friends .
even little jenny thinks she &apos;s too good for me ,
so ... bravo .
just like you wanted .
i have no one to turn to but you .
actually , you don &apos;t even have me .
enough .
i &apos;ll try to be more succinct .
you held a certain fascination
when you were beautiful ,
delicate ...
and untouched .
but now you &apos;re like ...
one of the arabians my father used to own--
rode hard and put away wet .
i don &apos;t want you anymore ,
and i can &apos;t see why anyone else would .
you okay ?
i &apos;d be a lot better if i could spend a semester
going to school in france .
a semester ?
well , i @-@ i already talked to harold about a visit ,
and he was-- he was thrilled .
so can i go ?
now ?
mom , please try .
blair , i am very concerned .
so book a flight .
we &apos;ll get you out tomorrow .
thank you .
who &apos;s up for a barneys drive @-@ by ?
me. ooh. followed by hot sake at decibel .
huh . i don &apos;t think so. yeah. she made out with the bartender last time .
now he thinks she loves him. what about you , little j . ?
oh , i can &apos;t . i have to return these books to the library .
elise will take them for you ,
won &apos;t you , e . ?
yeah , sure .
it &apos;s okay . i can do it .
the question isn &apos;t if you can do it , jenny ,
it &apos;s if you should have to .
i &apos;m going there anyway .
okay .
let me know if you need anything else .
you coming ?
props to blair. she trained you well .
don &apos;t act so surprised to see me .
how could i not stop by
after all those pitiful messages you left ? oh , for the record ,
i &apos;m really sorry for what happened the other night. so am i .
look , bex , i was married for almost 20 years ,
and before that , i was a somewhat successful musician ,
and i wouldn &apos;t really call what i was doing dating. what was it then ?
a succession of women--
groupies , mostly-- whose chose me .
i really don &apos;t have any experience
with real honest @-@ to @-@ goodness dating .
despite your worst efforts ,
i am completely charmed by you , rufus humphrey .
thanks , i think .
okay .
here &apos;s where we are .
dating 101 , lesson 1 .
in two days , you &apos;re gonna call me
and thank me for forgiving you of your dating faux pas .
you &apos;ll ask me out to dinner-- someplace elegant
but intimate , and we are going to have a fabulous time .
you got all that ? absolutely .
good. talk to you in two days. two days .
okay .
hello ?
i never was good at following rules .
hey. what are you doing here ?
i need to know why you love me .
because i do .
i really want to trust you when you say those words , dan ,
so maybe if i knew why , i &apos;d stop being so scared of hearing them
and afraid to say them .
okay .
well , if you want to talk about why--
it has to do with my mom and her many marriages .
there. that &apos;s why .
because i actually like it when you interrupt me ,
which is often , by the way .
i love you because you make no apologies
about being exactly who you are--
beautiful , smart ,
sexy as hell--
now you &apos;re embarrassing me .
that &apos;s another reason .
you &apos;re completely unaware of your affect on me .
you &apos;re also completely unaware
that you laugh like a 4 year old .
just like that .
and i love you because you can be with someone like me
and still be best friends with someone like blair .
yeah , well , i tried to be .
i know you do , and that &apos;s not easy ,
but you never give up on her .
that is how amazing you are .
well , you &apos;re amazing , too ,
for being able to say all of those things ,
you just are .
and i love you ...
but i have to go .
what ? what--what is it this time ?
one of the many reasons you love me .
blair .
what ?
you want a lift to j.f.k. ?
your mom said you were going to france tonight .
she has a big mouth. b . , i &apos;m your best friend .
she was shocked i didn &apos;t know .
well , now you do .
what i know is how you felt when i left without telling you .
is there a reason you &apos;re here ?
stay .
don &apos;t let some stupid scandal make you run away
like it did me , like it does everyone in our world .
everything &apos;s horrible .
my whole life is falling apart .
so rebuild it .
you &apos;re a waldorf , remember ?
people don &apos;t tell you who you are. you tell them .
stay and fight .
i &apos;ll fight with you .
i &apos;m so embarrassed .
i &apos;m so
so what ?
start over .
it can be done .
i should know .
we &apos;ll get through this together .
promise ?
promise .
stop , guys .
i &apos;m going home .
one good scandal deserves another .
wonder who &apos;s going down next ?
everybody , if b. has anything to say about it .
you know you love me ,
