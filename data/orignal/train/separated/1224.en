We need to open it.
I can't look.
Mona's body might actually be in there.
Nervous about something?
Mona Vanderwaal retained me to handle her affairs
in the event of her demise.
I was instructed to wait 30 days after her death,
then deliver this to you personally.
You might need to get a doctor to look at this.
Spencer, I have to tell you the truth
before it's too late.
You must be Spencer. I'm Colin.
Wren and Melissa's flatmate.
Welcome to London.
Why are you so sure that Alison isn't "A"?
Cyrus told me that "A" had him get Alison out of town that day.
Cyrus, what happened?
Carjack?
It's Varjak.
Cyrus wasn't trying to tell us what happened.
He was trying to tell us who did it.
You know I'm gonna have to tell my lawyers about Mike?
Ali, please don't do that.
His testimony might be the only thing that can save me.
Veronica reviewed your case and agrees with me.
It's not a good idea for you to take the stand.
How is telling the truth not a good idea?
Because you don't have anyone to back up your story.
I told you,
Cyrus Petrillo asked me to meet him at the time of the murder.
He set me up.
You also told the police he kidnapped you.
And if you admit that lie,
no jury will believe anything else you say.
There's someone else...
that can testify that I was set up.
Who?
Does this person know for a fact
where you were at the time of the murder?
No, but he--
Well, then no matter how compelling their testimony is,
they won't be able to corroborate your story.
So what, I'm just supposed to sit here
and pray that you can poke holes in the prosecution's theory?
There is another option.
The D.A. is offering a plea bargain.
What does that mean?
It means that if you plead guilty
and you take responsibility for your actions--
Wait. They want me to admit to killing Mona?
Yes.
And they want you to name the person that helped you do it.
Well, that's insane.
If you do both, they'll give you 15 years.
You could be out in 10 with good behavior.
That's never gonna happen.
Alison, this is a big decision.
You need to talk it over with your father.
There's nothing to talk about, because I did not kill Mona.
I'm not advocating you take this,
I just need you to understand
that the evidence against you is substantial.
If we go to trial,
the chances of you getting acquitted are not good.
And if you're found guilty,
the prosecution will be seeking life without parole.
The police are already building a case
against the person they believe helped you.
Who's that?
Hanna Marin.
What's going on?
I thought you weren't leaving till Thursday?
No, I'm sticking with my original plan.
I'm going back today.
I barely even got a chance to see you.
Besides, didn't Mom change your flight last night?
Yeah, I'm changing it back.
Spencer,
mom went out of her way to track down her friend
who works at St. Andrews.
It wasn't easy getting you that interview.
I don't want to go on another interview.
Yesterday was embarrassing enough.
It's not like you to run away.
The Spencer I know would stay and nail it
just to prove a point.
Okay, I'm not running away.
This just isn't a good time for me to be here.
Why?
Because there's a lot going on with my friends and...
Toby.
What's going on with Toby?
I don't know. We're not really talking right now.
He became a cop to try to protect me.
And now his job is ruining our relationship.
Sounds like being here is what you need.
Sometimes relationships run their course.
But you can't see it until you have a little distance.
It's not... it's not just about Toby.
You know what the best part about living here has been for me?
Getting a fresh start.
Away from all the Rosewood drama.
Yeah, that must be nice.
This could be your future, too.
Don't miss out on the opportunity.
Hanna says Alison doesn't know anyone named Varjak.
And you believe that?
Why would she lie? Her life is on the line.
Yeah, so is Mike's.
We need to talk to Cyrus.
If Varjak paid him to set up Ali,
then Varjak knows who "A" is--
Well, I called the hospital this morning.
And the nurse said Cyrus had a setback.
He's in the ICU.
Maybe Mike should tell the cops what he knows.
Then he winds up in jail with Ali.
Better than in the ICU with Cyrus.
Well, I'm not letting either of those things happen to my brother.
Maybe Ezra can help us.
But he did do a lot of research for his book.
Maybe he came across that name at some point.
So I take Melissa convince she to stay.
Yeah, well, she can be very persuasive.
Well, St. Andrews is a wicked school.
You'll love it.
And Kate found her prince there.
So who knows, maybe you will, too.
Well, a girl can dream.
So listen, I have an extra ticket to the theater tonight.
My mate dropped out this morning.
Care to go with me?
Oh, I would love to,
but I should probably stay in and prep for my interview.
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, of course.
It's just that Melissa mentioned you liked Shakespeare, so...
I don't like Shakespeare.
I love Shakespeare.
They're doing Hamlet at the RSC.
Seriously?
Oh, my gosh, seeing a play at the Royal Shakespeare Company
is on my bucket list.
I didn't know 18-year-olds had bucket lists.
Is that an American thing?
No, it's a Hastings thing.
I've had mine since I was six.
And Hamlet is my favorite.
Well, then. It must be fate.
Okay.
Yeah, I can prep for my interview tomorrow.
But I would like to pay for my ticket.
That's not necessary.
But if you'd really like to thank me,
you can buy me a pint after.
We'll leave at seven.
I wanted you to hear this from me,
but if anyone asks, this conversation didn't happen.
Okay.
Is Hanna in school?
No. She's up in her room.
She has study hall first period.
Alison's been offered a plea bargain.
Part of the deal is to name her accomplice.
I spoke to a friend of mine in the D.A.'s office.
They think it's Hanna.
Hanna?!
No, never in a million years would she hurt Mona.
I'm not saying that she did.
But the police have evidence.
What evidence?
I don't know all of it.
But I heard that Tanner found what she thought
were the remains of a body in a barrel of acid.
The barrel was in a storage unit.
And Tanner saw Hanna outside the unit that same day.
Yesterday, tests were confirmed
that there were bone fragments in the acid.
They were too small to get any DNA,
but Tanner believes it's Mona's.
That's horrible...
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation
for why Hanna was there.
One that has nothing to do with Mona or Alison.
Hanna doesn't even speak to Alison.
Hanna visited Alison in jail, twice.
Look, I know this isn't easy to hear,
but you have to prepare yourself in case Alison takes the plea.
I can certainly recommend an excellent defense attorney.
I can't believe this is happening to me.
Alison's not gonna take the plea.
She's innocent, and she knows Mona planned this scheme.
Well, it's not gonna be easy to prove.
Look, even if she does take the plea,
she won't name you as her helper.
She wouldn't sink that low.
Well, I want to believe that,
but we all know that Ali looks out for herself first.
And I'm the easy target!
I'll go to the jail and talk to her.
No, I'll go.
Maybe if she sees me, it'll make it harder
for her to ruin my life.
Hanna, you can't go.
You'll just be giving Tanner more ammo.
What'd Jason say?
Well, her dad's with her right now,
but she's not taking any other visitors.
Why would she do that?
Because she doesn't wanna face us.
You guys, Jason said that her lawyer got her so rattled
about the trial...
she's considering taking the plea.
I'm gonna call Spencer.
No, if you tell her about the plea,
she'll either bomb her interview,
or she'll skip it and come home.
Do you seriously want to be responsible for her
not getting into St. Andrews?
No, but she'll kill us
if we don't tell her what's going on.
I know, but, let's just hold off
until we know something more.
Fine.
But we should go talk to Ezra.
If he has any information on Varjak,
we need to know.
Yeah, but I-- I can't right now.
I have a history test in a few minutes,
and if I don't get my grade in,
I might lose my spot at Savannah.
"Good luck on your test. Hope your ankle's better.
Dinner tonight?"
Andrew.
Yeah, Andrew Campbell.
Is there something going on between you two?
He's helping me study.
Yeah. Besides that.
No.
So then why is he asking you to dinner?
And why are you blushing?
Fine. We kissed.
You happy?
You kissed him?
Em, do not look at me like that.
What? He helped me with my ankle last night.
He was comforting me.
And I just kinda got caught up in the moment.
What about Ezra?
I don't know what's going on with us.
And I can't think about that right now.
So you go talk to him.
And I'll meet up with you after the test.
Okay.
Tanner saw both of us there.
After she takes me down, she can go after you, too,
and it'll be my fault--
Hanna, calm down.
L-look, as far as we know,
all Tanner has on you is her suspicion.
If she had enough evidence to arrest you,
she would've done it already.
Wait, so you're saying if Ali doesn't take the plea,
this whole nightmare can go away?
We have to find out
what other evidence the police have on you.
How?
By talking to Toby.
But we've already been down that road with Toby.
He's not gonna tell us anything.
I'm not giving him a choice this time.
You need to come home with me.
I never came across the name Varjak in any of my research.
Are you sure Alison didn't know him?
Hanna found that Holly Varjaks passport in her attic.
Yeah, Ali said all that stuff was planted.
Everything the lawyer gave us was a set-up.
By Mona?
We don't know.
I mean, it could've been Mona or "A."
Are you sure you've never seen his name
in any of your research?
Can you please go back and take a look?
Emily, I would remember that name.
No, I know, it's just, I promised Hanna I'd help her.
And finding Varjak is our only hope.
We have nothing else to go on.
I mean Ali and Hanna could be convicted.
And I could be next. Or Aria.
Mona's lawyer, do you remember his name?
Um, yeah, James Neilan. Why?
Mona was working for "A" at the time.
And I bet Neilan was in on it.
I--I packed so fast,
I'm either gonna look like I'm going to my interview
or running a 10k.
Neither will do for a night out on the town.
Here.
How's this?
It's great.
Thank you.
Isn't that what sisters are supposed to do?
Share clothes and makeup tips.
I don't know. We never did.
It's my fault.
I never should've held on to that secret for so long.
Why did you?
At first I was protecting you.
Then I was protecting myself.
How do you get over something like that?
You don't.
I think about it every day.
I don't know if I could've done it,
if the roles were reversed.
You never know what you're capable of
until you're in the situation.
Doing something wrong can seem like the right thing
when you're trying to help someone you love.
Well, I'm hoping we can start over.
Yeah.
I'd like that.
Okay.
But if it's gonna work, there can be no more lies between us.
Sounds refreshing.
Okay, now, before you consider franchising,
I suggest you open a second location in this area.
That way, you can oversee it.
Build up the brand.
Makes sense to do that first.
And if that location's successful,
franchising would be the next step.
Do you have specific questions about how we structure our deals?
No, actually, I have a few questions about Mona Vanderwaal.
She was a client of yours, correct?
Why are you asking?
What I'm wondering is why she hired you to deliver
a package in the event of her death.
You're not an estate lawyer.
What is this meeting really about?
Did she hire you?
Or did someone pay you to lie and say that she did?
We're done here.
An innocent girl is accused of murder.
And I think the person who really hired you killed Mona.
And if you just tell me who that is,
you will save someone's life.
I suggest you leave before I call security.
Mr. Neilan, you can tell me or you can tell the police.
Hey, sorry, I got here as fast as I could.
Ezra's just in there talking to Neilan.
Y-you okay?
Yeah! Yeah.
I just haven't seen Ezra in a while.
I just don't want things to be weird.
I'm sure it'll be fine.
Um, so what did he tell you?
He wouldn't tell me anything.
Guys, look.
He's sure in a rush.
Hey, are you guys coming or not?
You're not going anywhere unl I get some answers.
I already told you,
I had nothing to do with Mona's murder.
And I said I believe you.
But you're not making it easy for me.
Why won't you tell me what you were doing at that storage unit?
Because once you know, you can't un-know.
This isn't a debate.
You don't have a choice. You need to tell me now.
Hanna!
Okay, I--I went there to move everything out of the unit.
I thought Mona's bloody clothes would be there,
maybe her body.
I thought you just said you had nothing to do with her death.
I didn't.
But someone put my name on the storage unit's lease.
And they rented it the day before Mona was murdered.
Who would do that?
Alison?
No.
Someone is framing her.
And now that same person is trying to frame me.
Thank you.
That was my first time buying beer legally.
This country does have its perks.
To Hamlet.
To revenge.
What'd you think?
I thought that the sets were really impressive.
The sets.
Right.
So critical to any star Shakespearean production.
The lighting was really good.
Another aspect typically overlooked by most audiences.
You didn't like it.
No, I didn't.
I really wanted to, though. I did.
It's just that I'm such a purist
when it comes to Shakespeare,
that seeing it set in present-day London--
Wasn't your cup of tea.
No. I mean, it was bad enough
that we had to see Hamlet in jeans and a T-shirt.
But did he really have to have a cell phone?
And whose genius idea was it
to have Claudius send Hamlet a text?
That would be the director's.
Who happens to be my brother.
You're joking, right?
Very much so.
No, I thought it was total rubbish, too.
But I'm clearly much more polite than you are.
Yeah.
There was one thing that got me thinking.
What if Hamlet had made it to England safely?
Do you think he could've started over?
You know, left all that... darkness behind
and created a new life for himself?
Well, I don't know about Hamlet.
But I believe you can.
You wanna play a game?
I put our names down on the list while you were getting the pints.
Oh, looks like we're next.
Nice.
Caleb and I were gonna move the barrel out of the bin,
but before we could do it,
Tanner and Toby showed up.
Why didn't you tell me about this
before you and Caleb went there?
I didn't want to drag you into my mess.
Hanna, I'm your mother.
It's my job to protect you.
I'm sorry.
You understand how serious this is, right?
Yes.
Do you have any idea who is doing this to you?
I thought it was Alison. But it's not.
I don't know who it is.
Bullseye!
Oh, that means I won.
Loser buys next round.
Ooh, actually, that was just shy of a bullseye.
But good effort.
What?
Melissa did mention you were competitive.
So I guess we have that in common, too.
What else did she mention?
She said you were bright, driven, loved literature,
the theater, everything in the arts, really.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah. Yeah, go on.
Did you really have those Hamlet tickets?
Or did you buy them this morning?
No, no, I had them.
But if I had known
what a lover of Shakespeare you were...
I would've gotten them for you.
You're up.
He's going in.
Who lives here really want to keep people out.
Who's Andrew?
Guys, we gotta go.
Why are you guys behind me?
Okay, uh, just stay right there.
I'm gonna try to find another way onto the property.
Oh, looks like this fence goes around the whole place.
Look, why don't I just take a look around?
No, Emily, we're not letting you go in there by yourself.
I'll be fine.
Emily, you have no idea who's in those woods or that house.
By the time that you guys find a way to get in here,
Neilan could be gone.
He came here for a reason. Don't we want to know what it is?
Okay, come on.
Hello?
Yeah, I'm going in now.
What's the combination?
He's been helping me study.
Andrew.
That's why he was so excited to hear I did so well on the test.
Well, it's good to hear that he's supporting you.
Well, I got to keep my grades up,
if I want to keep my spot at SCAD.
Emily mentioned that. Congratulations.
Thank you.
I was surprised you didn't tell me yourself.
Ezra, I meant to. It's just been a crazy week.
It's good to hear you're not avoiding me.
No. Why would I be?
You know what? It's probably best if we split up.
We'll just cover more territory that way.
Call me if you find a way in.
Hi, Alison.
Rebecca.
Are you okay?
If I agree to what you mentioned earlier,
can you promise me
that they'll move me to somewhere safer than this?
The one time I don't carry an umbrella with me.
The forecast didn't say rain.
This is London. We have clouds perpetually hovering over us.
Right, how about a drink to warm up?
I make a brilliant hot toddy.
Um, I should probably just stick with water,
and call it a night.
I'm still kind of jet-lagged.
Right, I'll, uh, I'll let you get some sleep.
Colin, I had a really great time tonight.
Thank you.
So did I.
Actually, it was the best night I've had in a long time.
Yeah. Me, too.
It's a shame you're leaving so soon.
London won't be the same without you.
And the guard said that my lawyer was here.
I just assumed that it was Rebecca.
Is it true?
You're taking the deal?
Well, if the D.A. gives me what I want.
I don't understand.
Yesterday you were so adamant about wanting to tell the truth.
Things change.
Look...
I can't imagine how horrible it must be for you, in here,
but taking the plea is not the answer.
Rebecca says that a jury won't believe me
if I take the stand.
And that I have too much evidence agnst me.
If I go to trial, I will lose.
You don't know that for sure.
Would you be willing to take that risk?
I admit, you have a difficult case.
And I understand why you're tempted to take the plea.
But if Hanna is innocent,
and you name her as your accomplice,
you'll have to live with that
terrible lie for the rest of your life.
托尼披萨屋
Is your mom here?
No, she's in town meeting with a lawyer.
Why?
Caleb, what's wrong?
I just got off the phone with Toby.
And?
Did he tell you what evidence they have against me?
No. He didn't.
But he wanted me to know that a judge
just issued a warrant for your arrest.
Alison took the plea.
I guess so.
How could she do this to me?
She must've panicked.
I've got to get out of here.
Where are you gonna go?
I don't know.Anywhere but here.
No, Hanna, you cannot run, okay?
They'll find you. And it will only make things worse.
How can it g worse?
I'm going to be arrested for something I didn't do.
And there's no way out.
Yes. Yes, there is.
You can tell Tanner about "A."
I can't do that.
That is who's doing this to you.
Not Alison.
"A" will retaliate.
"A" Already has. Over and over again.
It's time to put a stop to it.
This isn't a decision I can make on my own, okay?
This affects Aria, Spencer, and Emily just as much as me.
Okay, well, you don't have time to discuss it with them.
Caleb, if I tell Tanner,
everything unravels.
All of our secrets, all the lies we've told.
The time we were in New York, Shana, Aria.
Okay, well, your friends will understand.
And if they don't?
I'll be screwing them,
just like Alison screwed me.
Hanna, the cops are probably already on their way here.
Look, I understand that doing this will change everything.
For you, for us, for everybody.
But I don't see what choice you have.
You can do this.
What if Tanner doesn't believe me?
You have all of those threats from "A" on your phone.
She's gonna believe you.
Ready?
Yeah.
What do you need to talk to Lt. Tanner about?
Someone's framing me and Alison DiLaurentis
for Mona Vanderwaal's murder.
And I can prove it.
What's your name?
Hanna Marin.
Hold on. I'll be right back.
远程遥控
Wait, what just happened? What's happening?
Somebody hacked into your phone.
They're wiping it clean.
What?
Tanner will see you.
Just you.
I circled the entire property.
There is no way over that security fence.
Okay, I'm calling Emily.
Just not picking up.
Emi.
God, you scared the crap out of us!
Why weren't you answering your phone?
That's Varjak's house.
Wait, so Neilan is Varjak?
No, but he's working for him.
Oh, my God.
What?
Hanna's been arrested.
What do you mean arrested?
Where's Hanna now?
You guys have to show Tanner all of the pictures
and texts on your phones.
If you do, she'll have no choice but to believe Hanna.
We should wait for Spencer to get back tomorrow morning.
"Let's all start with a clean slate. - A"
Guys, all the texts "A" Sent me are gone.
Mine, too.
So we have nothing to help Hanna.
Uh, there is something.
I found this receipt at Varjak's house.
It doesn't just have his name on it.
It also has his phone number.
So, either Varjak is "A."
Or Varjak is working for "A."
This could help Hanna.
Hanna's lawyer will do his best to get her out on bail.
But it might not be possible.
They can't keep her locked up just because Alison said
she's her accomplice.
That's not why Hanna was arrested.
Alison hasn't taken the plea yet.
Then why?
Tanner found the clothes Mona was wearing the day she died.
And Hanna's blood was on them.
Hey, where are you going?
Home.
Why?
Hanna was arrested.
Arrested? For what?
They think she had something to do with Mona's murder.
But she didn't.
Have you talked to Mom?
No, I--I don't want to wake her.
I'm just gonna call from the airport.
Hey, uh, look, Spencer,
I understand that you're upset,
and I get that you want to help Hanna,
but I think it's better that you stay here.
I can't stay here. I have to be there for her.
What can you do?
I don't know yet.
Look, I want to reschedule the interview.
What's Mom's friend's number?
I don't-- I don't know.
Mom said that you were coordinating the details.
Not exactly.
Okay, so who is?
The interview isn't completely set up.
Completely?
Mom--
Mom doesn't have a friend at St. Andrews.
But Wren's been calling everyone he knows.
And he's trying his best to get you in there.
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry. Let me get this straight.
You and Mom pretended that I had an interview?
Mom found out that Alison was offered a plea bargain.
Part of the deal was to name her accomplice.
We were afraid she might name you.
So you lied to keep me here?
To keep you safe.
Melissa, we just had a conversation about this!
We agreed that we wouldn't have any more lies between us!
I was trying to protect you!
Okay, well, the last time you did that,
somebody got killed!
Yeah, I'll be right down.
Thank you.
It's my cab.
I was trying to help.
You're not.
Thanks for meeting me here.
Yeah, of course.
I, uh, I brought you a muffin. I can't promise it's any good.
'Cause I'm trying out this new chef.
Um, so did you figure out when you'll be able to see Hanna?
Not for a few days.
She still has to be fully processed first.
Yeah.
And I couldn't sleep at all last night.
Just thinking about how scared she must be,
all alone in there.
Hanna's really strong.
I think she's gonna be okay
till her mom gets her out on bail.
If she gets her out.
Look, Ezra, uh...
yesterday you had asked me
if I'd been avoiding you--
Look, we don't have to talk about this now.
I need to.
Seeing you made me realize that.
The truth is, I have been.
Because I know that,
once I say what I'm about to say,
I know that there's no taking it back.
You were right.
I--I did miss out on a lot of high school
because of our relationship.
And although I don't regret any of it,
I think that when I go away to college, I should be single.
Yeah, that's the right choice, Aria.
But if we're going to end it, I think we should do it now.
The past few weeks have been so difficult,
not knowing where we stood.
And it's gonna get so much harder if we're just
counting down the days till you go.
Yeah.
It's just...
I cannot imagine my life without you.
Oh, I know.
You don't have to.
I want you in mine, too.
We'll figure something out.
Open the gate!
Clear!
Good news.
The D.A. is willing to let you serve your sentence
in a minimum-security prison in Pennsylvania.
I spoke to your father this morning.
He feels it's your decision to make.
That's the deal.
Take your time. Read it over.
If you have any questions, I'll be right here.
After you've signed it, we'll schedule an appointment
for this afternoon, so you can meet with the D.A.
and tell him the name of your accomplice.
I've changed my mind.
I'm not taking the plea.
