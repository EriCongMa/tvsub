are we gonna be able to hang out with paul or is he also a teacher ?
no , he &apos;s a total guy &apos;s guy .
he normally spends thanksgiving with his nana ,
but she just passed away .
that &apos;s a great plan , jess , be the girl who replaces his dead nana .
i know !
guys , look , this is a bad idea .
he &apos;s gonna be our fifth roommate , i &apos;m telling you .
it &apos;s a first date .
we don &apos;t know him , okay ? we got to figure out
whether or not he &apos;s the right guy for us .
we deserve to be happy .
you guys , don &apos;t even get up .
just enjoy your beers . it &apos;s gonna be a great meal .
just curious , does anybody know anything about cooking ?
no pressure . just , like , cooking a turkey , for example .
it says you need some kind of string .
trussing string .
don &apos;t , schmidt !
that &apos;s a good turkey tip . you got more ?
here &apos;s a tip : don &apos;t cook thanksgiving dinner
for five people in 14 hours .
here &apos;s another tip : don &apos;t ask a guy out on a first date
on the least sexy holiday in america .
what are the most sexy holidays ?
the most sexy holidays are fourth of july ,
uh , independence day , obviously ,
women &apos;s history month and christmas .

okay .
no , no , no , no ! no , schmidt !
but i want to let you know up front that i &apos;ve got
some control issues in the kitchen ,
so i &apos;m gonna do this , i &apos;m cooking the whole meal .
i don &apos;t want you touching anything .
and i don &apos;t want to hear , &quot; schmidt , schmidt ,
you &apos;re using too much tarragon , &quot; because i &apos;m not .

it is ?
hey , guys .
cece ! thank god . come down here
and lie on the turkey with me .
oh , hell , yeah , do that .

and with a little coaxing , he might fiddle with the old horsehairs .
only if you don &apos;t mind being enchanted .
i just want to watch the game .
hey , nick , can i talk to you ?
i just need you not to do that thing that you do .
what thing ? i don &apos;t do a thing .
yes , you get all mean and you make that little turtle face .
okay , i don &apos;t think i make a turtle face .

not about politics or small business loans
or the google conspiracy thing , okay ?
i &apos;ve only seen him at school ,
and i really want to wow him tonight , okay ?
please , he &apos;s the only guy i &apos;ve liked since spencer .

guy roommates .
three guys .
it &apos;s intimidating .
i gotta be honest ,
it &apos;s intimidating coming to that arena .
it &apos;s hard to get to know people .
it &apos;s like goldilocks and the three bears .
bet you &apos;re the bear who has the bed that &apos;s just right .
it &apos;s a teacher joke , sorry .
okay , here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do , paul .

and you can know me better , yeah .
we &apos;re gonna play a little game .

with the fermentation process .
could be , could be .
uh , hey , do you want to watch football , the lions ?

they play every thanksgiving , right ,
because they &apos;re the most ferocious of the teams .
lions from detroit . detroit lions .

anyone who tells you the future of gravy
is nitrogen @-@ based is cooking with blinders on , cece .

his name was nelson .
hey , schmidt , how &apos;s it going ?
well , i need some walnuts . i have no walnuts .
i should go get those . you should stay here with the turkey .
though , shoot . i have had two pumpkin ales .
i probably shouldn &apos;t get behind the wheel of a car .
nick , how many pumpkin ales have you had ?
oh , i &apos;ve had zero pumpkin ale .
then can you take paul to the store , right ?
getting some walnuts , getting some walnuts .
i &apos;m sorry , man , are you singing about what we &apos;re doing ?
yeah , guess i was .
sometimes i don &apos;t even realize i &apos;m doing it .
where are you from ?
chicago .
oh , land of plenty .
it &apos;s weird being in l.a.
it doesn &apos;t feel like thanksgiving .
it feels like there should be , like ,
a little nip in the air , you know ?
a little bit like ...

i have an idea !
let &apos;s go next door .
mrs. beverly &apos;s really great . she &apos;s visiting her sister ,
but she gave me her spare key for emergencies .
so we &apos;re breaking and entering .
that &apos;s a felony , fyi .
hey , law school ! nice !
no , we &apos;re not breaking in .
i gave her a key to our place , too .
she sometimes has a problem with her shower .
no , not you .
what are you doing ? you promised me you &apos;d be nice to him .
i was nice to him ! i &apos;ve been very nice to paul .
the whole car ride over i was nice to him .
you know what he tells me about ?
he likes air bud 2 .
he loves dogs . i know where
he gets his copies made . he likes to whistle .
he wanted to open the door with me ,
so when my hand went up , so did his .
oh , i get it .
he &apos;s not cool enough for you .
&apos;cause nobody can be cool enough for cool nick miller .
i &apos;m nick miller .
i &apos;m so cool , i &apos;ll make my cool face .
why don &apos;t you like him ?
who cares ? do you like him ?
of course i like him .

you heard me !
big @-@ time ! okay ?
i want to take him down to chinatown
and slice him off a piece of this pumpkin pie , okay ?
what is pumpkin pie ?
i want to do all the things
that you do in a bedroom , with him , okay ?
i want to do it standing up and sitting down ,
and half @-@ up and half @-@ down ,
and the wiggly one , and the bear attack ,
and the claws in the head ,
and the one the figure skaters do ,
and the what &apos;s for lunch ,
and the ... give me that hat .
let &apos;s just say that i &apos;m good . i &apos;m really , really good .
and i don &apos;t care what you think !
then why did you ask me ?
hey , jess .
uh ... just want you to know everyone really loves paul .
and also , we can hear everything you &apos;re saying .
what ?
play through .
after you , jess .
excuse me .
so , um ... just a heads @-@ up .
uh ... we &apos;re just rehearsing a play that , uh ,
nick is writing . it &apos;s called ...

i &apos;ve done give me that hat .
only for me it was like , i , you know , i was like ,
i was like , &quot; here , take my hat . &quot;
do you know what i mean ?
so how bad was it , on a scale from one to bad ?
let &apos;s put it this way : a normal guy
would &apos;ve left a long time ago and he &apos;s still here , right ?
he &apos;s not normal .
schmidt yelled at me earlier .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
did he get weird ? he &apos;s weird about cooking .
did you touch his whisk ?
no , the thing is , jess ...

and i just love it .

it &apos;s hour nine . i &apos;m starving .
well , i can blanch or i can talk ,
but i can &apos;t do both .
i &apos;m going in .
nick ...
i gotta just say something to you .
i feel like ... you think i &apos;m kind of annoying .
you didn &apos;t have to come here to say that .
you could &apos;ve done it from over there .
okay . and if that &apos;s the case-- which i don &apos;t know that it is--
it is .
i don &apos;t care .
i actually feel sort of sorry for you ,
because at this point in your life i know
that you &apos;ll never dislike me more than you dislike yourself .
really ? that &apos;s what you &apos;re going with , violin ?
want a little , um , napkin @-@ folding music ?
kind of need it .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re still here .
what do you mean ? of course i &apos;m still here .
why wouldn &apos;t i be here ?
let &apos;s talk about what happened earlier .
&apos;cause you made me feel like i was a really bad girl .
i know i did , and ...
