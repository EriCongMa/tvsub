We got a package from my dad.
No air holes in the box.
That's a good sign.
Lily loved having that chicken.
One more time than she realized.
Listen, I just got an e-mail from our wedding singer.
He has a small request.
Another one?
Since when does the wedding singer send us requests?
Well, no, he just wants to change a few songs in your medley
to avoid overlap with the stuff that he's performing.
Well, I hope it's none of my showstoppers.
Oh, they're all showstoppers.
Oh, you're too kind.
Oh, my gosh, it's us.
For our wedding cake.
Couldn't you just die?
I really think I could.
My dad made this.
He's a world-class soap carver.
You know, once, when I was a kid, I cussed,
and my mom washed my mouth out
with the leaning tower of Pisa.
She still blames herself to this day.
Oh, I would have nixed that wedding topper immediately,
but Cam and I have an agreement.
We -- we each got three vetoes of each other's wedding ideas --
No questions asked.
And it -- it worked for...a while
I think you're gonna love my wedding board.
I'm pretty excited, too.
Veto.
Veto.
Veto.
Veto.
I'm sorry I'm so emotional.
It's just the nicest thing ever.
You don't think that I look just a little bit --
I mean, my dad carved through his arthritis!
Maybe it's the kicky leg.
I mean, the hours his ruined hands put into this.
He found us in soap.
Today, mitchell, I know love.
I no love, either.
So, take your time looking around.
Thanks.
I'm helping Gloria sell the old apartment
that she and Manny lived in before she met Jay.
It's in an up-and-coming neighborhood
with a distinct multicultural bent
that's undergoing an exciting urban renewal.
That's a fancy way of saying "The gays found it."
I can't believe that I lived here for five years.
Even turning the lights on was a pain.
Look at this.
Keep it down, you bitch!
Ay. Mrs. Rivera's still alive.
I am really digging this place.
Right?
The gas stove, the moldings --
they don't make 'em like this anymore.
I'll probably gut it.
Rip it out.
That's what I'd do.
I want my contractor to swing by,
but I really like it.
Great. All right. Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Talk to you soon.
So nice to meet you.
I'm not selling to him.
What? Really?
He's a quality buyer.
You're tired of finding renters.
This is a family building.
Generations have lived there,
and usually at the same time.
He just wants to flip it.
Okay.
I got a backup I can probably get here in an hour.
You want to wait in there?
You walk in that door,
you never come out.
No, no, not the bar -- the coffee shop.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
But we can wait next door.
That's my old hair salon where I used to work.
You can get drinks there, too.
Gloria!
No, no, no, it's not Jay.
What's so funny?
What's so funny?
She thinks you're my lover.
That is funny!
I don't know if it's "a room full of women laughing" funny,
but...
Ay, Rita, no.
Phil is a friend of mine,
and we're just killing time before an appointment.
I hate to ask, Gloria,
but my new girl hasn't shown up.
Any chance you could help?
Ay, of course!
It will be so much fun!
I don't want to ruin my nails.
Phil, would you do my shampooing?
Well, I-I guess so.
We've got the time.
Just a warning --
I haven't shampooed professionally since college,
and that was only part-time to pay for my cheer gear.
Wow. That was super-braggy.
What do we got, double sinks?
What's the nozzle sitch?
Not to sound too braggy,
but your mom was kind of
a badass at work this week.
It was hard enough with grandpa being sick
and me suddenly in charge,
but it was just one crisis after another.
Luke, honey, we're going!
Fire in the warehouse,
surprise inspection from OSHA,
our biggest buyer tried to pull out of a deal,
and I have to talk him off a ledge.
Whatever. It's over now.
I don't want to bore you guys with this stuff.
So, when I get to work on Wednesday,
Margaret is ready in tears,
and there are two cops in the waiting room,
and I say to them,
"One of you had better be able to drive an 18-wheeler,
"because I've got 100 rosewood panels to get to Victorville,
or it's coming out of my paycheck."
I told you guys about the drivers and the bad tuna?
Bad tuna,
Yes.
yeah.
Yes, I did.
Hey, mom, I forgot how fun this car was.
And these automatic doors and that TV in the back.
You know what else was fun?
The party they threw for me at work on Friday.
I mean, it was a little bit embarrassing.
I didn't even know "She-ro" was a word,
and there it was, in icing.
Hello, hello!
Welcome to Jay's night.
Names, please.
Want to make sure you're on the list.
Kidding! Just excited.
Appetizers on the bar,
scrabble on the coffee table,
and our feature presentation,
"The Great Escape."
Speaking of which, Haley...
Don't worry, grandpa.
I'm not leaving.
I have no plans for the night.
Me, either.
But when I say it, it's news.
When you say any complete sentence,
it's news.
Okay, girls. Dad, you feeling better?
You had a rough week, huh?
Nah. I'm fine.
Looks like you had a big week.
You heard about that?
Yeah, I got the blow-by-blow on all the office drama.
By the way, sincerely...
Yeah?
...great...
great guacamole on the bar, there.
Wow. That's it?
Everything you did for him,
and he doesn't even say "Thank you"?
I get it.
It's "Hero" with a "She."
Okay, I'm up to speed.
Yeah, that was cold.
It's just his way.
After years of disappointment,
I have learned not to expect a pat on the head from my dad.
He's not capable of it.
But it has taught me a very important lesson
that you girls should learn, too --
approval comes from within.
I knew that, mom.
'Course you did, 'cause you're smart.
Hey, is Lily out of the tub?
We got to be at my dad's soon.
Oh, no!
It's not that big of a deal.
We can be a little late.
No! Lily had the cake topper
in the tub with her!
Oh, no. How could such a terrible mistake have occurred?
I think she must have just thought it was a toy or something.
Well, I hope it's not completely ruined forever.
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?
My daddy uses a special shellac on this thing.
This is water-resistant,
heat-resistant -- you name it.
Good to know.
Yeah, but put it someplace safe.
It could still be slippery,
so be careful.
Is it?
Oh, yeah, it is!
It's slippery!
Is it okay?
Not a scratch.
Apparently, I'm tougher than I look.
Hey, boys. Having fun?
You know it.
Love us some Jay's night.
Okay, we're out of here.
Kristy Hughes,
A.K.A. "Kristy huge ones,"
is having a pool party two blocks away.
What about Jay?
He thinks we're at a party.
He'll never know.
We sneak out, work the room,
cannonball, cannonball,
and we're back in time for dinner.
Were you even invited?
No.
But that's only because I don't know her or any of her friends.
We're not invading her house.
Besides, this hair at a pool party --
One dunk, and it goes off like an airbag.
What's this? You made sauce?
Well, you were sick.
I didn't know if you could handle it.
Back in Vietnam, I had hepatitis.
Still managed to cook Thanksgiving dinner
for 300 soldiers.
I think I can handle sauce.
Well, I saved you the trouble.
So, Margaret tells me I'm using some new delivery trucks now.
Yeah. They're hybrid.
Now, they cost a little more,
but when I factored in the tax rebates
you get for going green,
we come out ahead.
Speaking of "Green,"
you went a little heavy on the vegetables, huh?
I'm not sure I can stomach anything that's healthy.
Gosh, mom, that truck thing sounds so amazing.
Yeah!
It's fine, dad.
Only do what we're capable of, right?
Oh, damn.
No, Stella, stay. No.
Good girl.
Thank you, Stella.
Thank you for listening.
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
Who's my best girl?
Don't.
Okay, girls, we are ready for scrabble.
I'll grab some snacks.
Uh, potato chips, please.
Oh, so I can hear about how much
you hate yourself all night?
Hello, Luke.
Come on! We've got to go!
That party's full of sophomores.
Those women have lived.
No, we're going back inside,
we're eating Jay's food,
and we're playing his board games.
More like boring games.
They're already called "Board."
You don't make it more clever by --
Never mind.
Okay. Thanks.
Did you work everything out with the wedding singer?
Oh, yeah -- I'm just dropping my big finale
because he's doing the same song.
"My Way"?
His way.
Hey, guys.
Sorry we're late,
but we come with wine.
And whittlin'!
Check it out.
This is a beautiful gift my father made
for the top of our wedding cake.
I guess he ran out of soap before he got to me.
Darn.
For you.
Ladies, check out
your uncle Mitch and Cam in soap.
That's soap?
It's beautiful.
This is my worst nightmare.
You shouldn't have blown through those vetoes.
This is how Cam's dad sees me --
like some fawning damsel.
If anything, Cam's the damsel.
Dad!
Thank you.
A lot can happen before the big day.
Believe me, I've already tried.
That thing is indestructible.
What if it went missing?
Things disappear around here all the time.
Do they?
All the time.
Let's just say I have a friend
who helps me in these kinds of situations.
I'm listening.
The less you know, the better.
I'm not listening.
We never had this conversation.
This is a non-versation.
Right.
I am giving you the...no-ahead.
Oh, I miss you girls.
Nobody in my white family thinks that I am funny.
Honey, Hector had a life before he met you.
So I have to eat dinner with his ex?
Well, you certainly don't want him going alone --
Not with his history.
Who are you really mad at?
Ay, I don't know.
Come on, Luisa.
Raul!
Hector's going to hurt me just like Raul did!
There it is.
But Hector isn't raul, okay?
They're just cousins.
We need to get a move on.
The client's gonna come over to the apartment at 4:00.
I am swamped. I can't just leave.
Gloria, we're here to sell your apartment.
We don't work at the salon.
Muchísimas gracias, Bianca.
No más texting ese hombre.
It's for a young couple with a baby on the way.
They're not flippers.
They're looking for a place to settle down and make a home.
Okay, just move them.
If they really want it, they'll come back.
But, Gloria --
Ay, please, just help me with Anna's foils.
I have a weave emergency!
Something's not right.
Qué qué pasó?
No, no, no, not with you. You look great.
You know who's gonna hate this,
is a certain jealous sister.
Cinco de my, oh, my.
How am I supposed to do this with so many "I"s on my rack?
Sorry.
Where's Luke?
How long does it take him to get the dictionary?
We described it for him perfectly.
Wait a minute.
He's not coming back.
Ugh. Move your "S."
I-I'm going as fast as I can.
Mitchell! It's gone!
What is?
The cake topper.
Lily, have you seen the little daddies
you were bathing with earlier?
Don't say that.
I saw Stella playing with it.
What?
Oh, look at her. She's all muddy.
She must have brought it outside and buried it.
She does it all the time!
Oh, no. We have to go find it.
Good luck.
That thing's as good as gone.
Dang it!
And the worst part is,
we don't even have a picture of it.
Do we?
Okay, we can't give up.
Let's go out into the yard and look for it.
Careful. I wouldn't come between Stella
and anything she's buried.
She's a wild animal.
No telling what she'll do.
That's a very aggressive stance.
Luke! Wait!
Oh. Look at that.
You left your yard,
and your little shock collar didn't go off.
Luke --
Okay, so, here's the new plan.
You hang back while I break the ice,
and then, when the time is right --
Manny! You made it!
Who's this?
"Who's this?"
Excuse me,
Kristy huge ones, I have a name.
Okay, come on. Stop.
I'm tired of chasing you all day.
Then don't.
Stay as long as you want at that lame party.
You want to talk?
You're the dorky sidekick, not me.
Want to talk nicer?
How could you be invited and I wasn't?
I don't know.
It's like the stuff that used to make me kind of weird,
people are starting to like.
So?
I'm the same as I always was.
Well...maybe you could upgrade a little.
Uh, we're tired of the yoda voice,
and if a girl tells you she went to london,
maybe don't ask if she also saw France.
I liked things better when you were the one
who was ostrich-sized.
What?
You know, like a freaky outsider --
the way an ostrich feels around regular birds.
You know what else girls like?
The mysterious, silent type.
What are you doing with my sauce, there, cookie?
That's yours.
This is mine.
I prepped it this morning.
I figured, why not make it?
Um...maybe because I already made sauce?
Can't have too much.
Can't ya?
Hand me that ladle, huh?
What are you doing? I got it.
What do you say?
What?
What do you say when somebody does something for you?
What do you say?
You want me to thank you for handing me a ladle?
You thanked the dog for staying --
which is basically doing nothing --
so I know you know the words.
Fine.
Thank you for handling me the ladle.
You sure those are ready?
You didn't throw one against the wall.
Oh, dad, nobody does that anymore.
Oh. I guess we have new ways for doing everything now, huh?
No. I didn't say that.
I'm just saying that you can taste your food
instead of flinging it at the wall like a chimp.
Okay.
How's it taste?
Actually, mm, that's pretty good.
But it could use a little,
um...sauce.
Let me just -- ooh, hot.
Try a little Parmesan with that?
I should probably get that bread in the oven.
Just...
Okay! Hey!
Hey, how about we take over in here
while you two get cleaned up for dinner?
Yes, good idea.
Yeah. Okay.
Approval comes from within.
Thank you.
Your sauce needs garlic.
Okay.
Okay.
And that's a clock.
Okay, well, do another one.
I've done like four.
This dog is a worse hoarder than your uncle Clayton.
He's a collector.
Of expired yogurt?
Getting tired.
Cam, can we just stop, please?
I feel like we've done our best,
but we're just not gonna find it.
Found it!
Oh! Good.
Thank god.
I hadn't even told you my biggest plan for this yet.
Bigger than the top of our wedding cake?
I'm gonna have a mold made of it and give a reproduction
to everyone who comes to the wedding
and everyone who can't come to the wedding.
Imagine hundreds of these across the country.
No!
No! No! Absolutely not!
I hate it! It's awful!
I knew it!
I knew it!
It just shows up in Lily's bath,
and then, all of a sudden, the dog has it?
You have it in for this beautiful topper.
Look at this. Look at it. Look at it!
Come on, you're all heroic and Paul Bunyan-y,
and I'm -- I'm, like, some sissy man
with -- with pinkish cheeks and a turned-out heel.
It's a caricature.
What matters is what it represents.
My daddy making this for us
means he's accepted us for who we are!
Don't you get that?
I never really thought about it that way.
No. You hadn't.
I'm just being sensitive.
I need to have a thicker skin.
I-I'm really, really sorry.
No, don't -- don't -- don't be sorry.
No.
And I -- n-- I don't want something at the wedding
that makes you uncomfortable.
Well, no, that doesn't seem fair.
I've used up all my vetoes.
Well, if it --
I guess, if it makes you feel better,
I could give you one more veto --
if you give me one more, too.
Okay, sure.
And in the future,
if there's anything --
The wedding singer.
Okay. Thanks, daddy.
I'll send you the perfect picture to model it on.
After today, I'm convinced
our landfills are 10% hair.
Oh, yes.
I forgot how exhausting this is.
Well, all we have to do
is meet the clients back at the apartment,
and then we can head home.
Ay, no. I'm too tired now.
Let's reschedule.
Really? Again?
Yes. Let's meet them next week.
And besides, we're late for Jay's party.
Well, I'm not letting you go home looking like this.
You're a little ratty back here.
Ay, no.
No, no, no. I got it.
You just relax.
What a day, huh?
Being back here must bring up a lot of memories.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe even some emotions.
Yeah. It feels weird.
No, weird's an adjective,
not an emotion, but go on.
Well, it's just that my life now is so different than before --
so much easier.
And that makes you feel...?
Good.
And also...?
And bad.
Why?
I don't know.
Come on, now, Gloria.
I don't know.
I guess it just makes me feel a little ashamed.
Now, what in the world do you have to be ashamed of?
It's just that, you know,
before, when I used to live here,
I used to work for every penny.
I would stand on my own two feet.
Now I just stand on expensive shoes
that Jay buys for me.
Is that why it's so hard to let go of the apartment?
No, Phil, it's not that --
Gloria.
Maybe.
Gloria.
Yes.
It's the last piece of the old me.
No, no! You're going too deep!
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but I think you're looking at this all wrong.
The old you hasn't gone anywhere.
I-I-I see it in the way you're raising Manny and Joe,
the way you care for Jay.
You never take anyone or anything for granted.
You worked hard for years
without knowing that things were gonna get better.
And then the universe rewarded you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
So you're not mad at me
because I don't want to sell the apartment?
No.
You'll know when you're ready,
and I'll be here.
Aw, Phil.
You're the best.
There's no one like you.
Claire, that looks so good.
I can't wait to try it.
Thank you.
Something has happened here.
Well, you'll all be happy to know
that our search for the cake topper
unearthed a number of family treasures.
Come on, Cam. We're eating over here.
Wait.
Didn't I give you this for Father's Day?
And that.
You see how this dog is?
My karaoke microphone.
Jay, check it out!
The other walkie-talkie!
Shame on you, Jay Pritchett!
You have used this dog to bury the things that you hate.
What?
Yeah!
Since when do you need help burying things?
Calm down. She buries stuff of mine, too. Look.
Everybody at the office bought me this clock last month.
Honey, what's the matter with you?
That's a question that maybe you should answer.
Oh, my gosh! My headphones!
That's the worst.
"Here's to 40 years in the business.
Enjoy your new timer, old-timer."
Suddenly, it made sense.
In my dad's mind,
I was reaching for a torch he wasn't ready to pass.
Sure, someday,
I'm gonna take over his business,
but not tonight.
Tonight is still Jay's night.
So, dad...
turns out,
I did have a bunch of questions for you last week,
but I didn't want to bother you with them.
I didn't want you to think I couldn't handle it.
There's no shame in asking for help.
You can always call.
Well, I won't need to.
You'll be in the office down the hall, right?
Right.
Goldilocks to Papa Bear.
Goldilocks to Papa Bear.
Come in, Papa Bear.
This is Papa Bear.
On location in the garage, Papa Bear.
Got some cocoa with your name on it.
What's your 20?
Oh, what the hell?
What's going on?
The kids unfriended me again.
How am I supposed to know what's going on in their lives
If they never talk to me?
Honey...
I got this.
Yeah. It's been kind of a rough year.
New school,
new kids,
and now I'm taking advice about girls
from a kid who has his own shoe buffer.
What?!
I tried beer.
Wow, dad. This feels great.
Good. Good.
You're-- you sure there's --
there's nothing on your mind?
No.
Why do you ask, dad?
You seem upset about something.
It's just, you reach a certain age,
and you start to wonder,
"Am I everything I wanted to be?"
I mean, am I selling houses,
or am I just selling out?
Anything else?
