what about bonnie ?
she sacrificed herself so i could come back .
she &apos;s all alone .
i &apos;m sorry i compelled away the memories .
we &apos;ll make new ones .
i hate you for ruining our friendship ,
and i think that i deserve better than that .
enzo , let her go , or i swear--
no !
how do you feel about being a hunter again ?
why ?
because i want you to help me kill enzo .
get the ascendant from jo .
i understand .
damon is a vampire .
are you saying damon compelled me ?
he wouldn &apos;t do that . he &apos;s my friend .
jo drove me across the border .
look , ric .
my coven put kai in a prison world .
kai ?
as in our brother , my twin .
in our coven &apos;s tradition ,
the twins merge their strength .
the stronger one wins , absorbing their twin &apos;s power .
the weaker one dies .
i &apos;m not gonna let you die .
kai is here .
i guess this is that , uh ,
antimagic border ,
which means now there &apos;s a psycho loose in mystic falls
and no vampires around to stop him .
what the hell do you want ?
feel like making a deal with the devil ?
how much are you gonna want to kill me
if i need to rain check tonight ?
what happened ?
i have a possible 480 hit @-@ and @-@ run on campus ,
one doa , 4 reds en route .
have your previous boyfriends understood this language you speak ?
i &apos;m gonna miss dinner
so you &apos;re my boyfriend now ?
there &apos;s no hospital code for awkward silence .
give me two hours . save me dinner .
doctor , we have a young female with abdominal wounds .
put her in t3 . i need 10 milligrams of morphine .
mine &apos;s conscious .
see a lot of blood , no broken bones .
making any sense to you ?
no , it &apos;s not . what happened to you ?
were you hit by a car ?
can &apos;t breathe .
it &apos;s ok . you can tell me what really happened .
sweetheart ?
look at me .
what happened to you ?
i stabbed her .
sorry . had to .
you know you just declared war , right ?
come on . caroline &apos;s over there .
come on .
heh . nope . i &apos;m not noticing you .
today &apos;s not may 10 , 1994 .
today &apos;s the tree decorating ceremony ,
and you are not telling me otherwise .
i just figured that we were skipping christmas this year ,
you know , considering the part where i die
if i cross the border into my hometown .
what happened to christmas being your favorite time of the year ?
was my favorite time of year
when i could actually live in my own house
and help decorate the town tree
and drink hot cocoa with my friends .
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re supposed to be at
the mystic falls tree decorating ceremony .
i &apos;m playing hooky this year .
i figure just because you can &apos;t come home for the holidays
doesn &apos;t mean the holidays can &apos;t come to you .
you even brought our favorite ornaments .
mom !
i , uh , didn &apos;t know which ones to get ,
so i got both .
what are you doing here ?
your mom needed christmas lights .
you have a huge dorm ,
and i thought we could use an extra set of hands .
the little ones obviously .
are you watching me sleep ?
no . i &apos;m watching you drool all over ric &apos;s textbooks ,
and considering you &apos;re already on his bad side ...
i don &apos;t drool .
what time is it ?
time for ric to get a new reference library .
we &apos;ve been looking all night .
i swear i haven &apos;t found anything that even remotely resembles
an ascendant .
well , we haven &apos;t looked hard enough .
let &apos;s get to it .
find anything yet ?
nope .
still staring .
it &apos;s just ...
everything you &apos;ve been doing for bonnie .
thank you .
she &apos;d do it for us .
hello , ric .
have you seen jo ?
no , not since yesterday .
why ?
so i asked around the hospital .
no one &apos;s seen jo since last night at the er .
a bunch of stab victims came in ,
and one of them &apos;s missing , as well .
it was kai .
jo knew he &apos;d come after her , and he did .
not to give you boyfriend lessons or anything ,
but if you knew jo &apos;s whackjob brother was out on the loose
and after her , don &apos;t you think that keeping an eye on her
would have been a smart move ?
and what would you have had me do , damon ,
ask you to compel jo to stay put ?
guys , if kai has jo , we need a plan .
plan &apos;s easy . find kai , fftt , kill kai .
bottom line , we need to keep kai alive .
you think i &apos;m gonna protect the guy
who chased us around the house
with a baseball bat when we were 4 ?
luke &apos;s right , tyler .
you &apos;re on some serious crack .
right now , you two are stuck doing the twin @-@ merge for your coven , ok ?
that means one lives , one dies ,
but if we help kai and he finds a way to merge with jo ,
it &apos;s not your problem anymore .
until kai becomes the most powerful witch
in our coven and goes on a killing spree .
something tells me that &apos;s gonna become our problem .
what does he want us to do exactly ?
just think sociopathic ryan reynolds .
haven &apos;t seen him .
grunge vibe , annoying as hell .
still no idea .
well , if he has half a brain ,
he will be hiding where vampires can &apos;t find him .
so in between levels of mario kart ,
can you and little baby gilbert maybe keep an eye out ?
yeah , got it . if we see him , we &apos;ll let you know .
who was that ?
it was damon .
apparently , there &apos;s a psychopath roaming mystic falls .
you tell him we &apos;re busy hunting down a psychopath
roaming outside mystic falls ?
must have forgot to mention it .
look . you better get out of here .
enzo &apos;s gonna be here soon .
let &apos;s kill a vampire .
well , bevis and butthead are on the lookout .
anyone else brimming with confidence ?
i mean , this just doesn &apos;t make sense .
what could possibly not make sense
about magical twins absorbing into one another .
listen . jo needs her magic for the merge to work , ok ,
and she got rid of that back in 1994 .
kai said jo hid her magic in a knife somewhere .
it &apos;s probably back in portland ,
where she got rid of it in 1994 .
he checked . the knife &apos;s not there .
he thinks someone took it .
jo doesn &apos;t have magic because it &apos;s stuffed in a knife
that was stolen and hidden by yours truly .
kai won &apos;t find it .
yeah , unless kai does a locator spell .
it &apos;s impossible .
why ?
kai was born without the ability to do magic .
let me guess . kai wants us to do a locator spell on the knife .
if we find it ,
jo can get her magic back ,
kai can merge with her ,
and you and luke live .
this is ridiculous .
this is our job .
merging is our duty to the coven .
it &apos;s why we were born .
no . we were born because our coven decided
that jo wasn &apos;t strong enough to beat kai .
why should we have to die
because our sister &apos;s too weak to defeat our psychopath of a brother ?
you know , a month ago , the thought of bowing out
never even occurred to you .
that &apos;s because kai wasn &apos;t here a month ago ,
but he &apos;s here now .
luke , we don &apos;t have to do this .
we have a chance to live out normal , human lives .
we could actually be happy .
if the only way to restore jo &apos;s magic
is to reunite her with that knife ,
kai &apos;s gonna come for it .
ric &apos;s right .
even if kai can &apos;t do the locator spell ,
he &apos;s gonna make it his mission to find it .
kai finds it . great . love it .
why aren &apos;t you more concerned ?
because if kai goes for the knife ,
i will kill him
because the knife is right here where i hid it .
i know i tried to kill you when you were toddlers ,
but i got to say ,
it sure is nice to be around family for the holidays .
dad &apos;s not here yet .
oh , yeah . you know what ? he &apos;s not gonna make it .
you remember his friend steven ?
he needed help moving a couch or something ,
so he &apos;s gonna miss out .
but it &apos;s an undeclared law that the sheriff and her husband
put the star on the tree .
then we will just have to let the lockwoods have the honors this year .
is something going on between you two ?
it &apos;ll be fine , i promise .
mom , i &apos;m a freshman in high school , ok ?
i can handle adult conversations .
no worrying during the holidays , ok ?
and that tree is not gonna decorate itself .
go .
maybe you &apos;ll meet a cute surfer .
doubtful . my dad &apos;s conference is two hours away from any beach .
ahh ! cute surfer ? where ?
nowhere . bonnie &apos;s dad is dragging her on a work trip ,
so i &apos;m gonna ask my parents if she can spend the holiday with us .
are you serious ?
yeah . the 3 of us have never spent christmas apart .
i plan on keeping it that way ,
even though jeremy will hate it .
it &apos;s always fun to torture him .
i love you .
almost as much as i love torturing jeremy .
ok , great ! now that christmas is saved ,
let &apos;s get these garlands on the tree
before they end up on your hips .
here . i got it .
what are you doing here ?
well , your mom asked for my help .
no , stefan . what are you doing here ?
because if you think hanging a few stands of light is gonna
make me forget what a crappy friend you &apos;ve been ,
then you thought wrong .
caroline , i &apos;m trying , ok ?
you &apos;re trying ?
no . this is the easy part , ok ?
we &apos;re hanging christmas lights .
anyone can be friends when you &apos;re hanging christmas lights .
who wants hot chocolate ?
i was just leaving .
mom ? !
i just got really ...
mom !
you ok ?
what the hell is he doing ?
probably playing tic @-@ tac @-@ toe with himself
like a crazy person .
this is the antimagic border .
jo can get her magic back over there while over here ...
what did you do to me ?
sissy &apos;s up .
what the hell did you do to me ?
i haven &apos;t seen you in 18 years .
you can &apos;t muster a hello ?
what did you guys do ?
what you should have done 18 years ago .
it &apos;s not gonna work kai . i don &apos;t have my--
magic . yeah . yeah . i recall .
you stored it in this .
what the hell ?
i &apos;m trying to reunite jo with her ...
magic .
it &apos;s not working .
enough , enough , man .
i was going to kill you
when your brain was the size of an acorn .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;ll do it now ?
whatever . i &apos;m not watching this .
oh , so dramatic .
all right .
sissy ...
let &apos;s try this again .
stop . i put my magic in there by choice .
taking it back is also my choice
unless i bleed to death ,
which will happen in the next 30 minutes .
wouldn &apos;t it be ironic
if you accidentally killed me before the merge ceremony ?
i &apos;m going to find a bandage
while you figure out how to put the magic in this knife
into our sister .
preferably by the time i get back
so i don &apos;t have to dull it by slitting your throat .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . she just collapsed .
one second , we &apos;re decorating ,
and then the next , she &apos;s just on the ground .
maybe she forgot to eat .
you know , sometimes , she skips breakfast .
and when was the last time you ate , caroline ,
as in fed ?
oh , god . now you sound like stefan .
he just went to go find something to take the edge off .
heh . they have her sedated .
she &apos;s going to be asleep for a while .
can you just come and distract me ?
how &apos;s the search for the new ascendant thingy ?
not good .
damon and i spent the night researching .
god . poor bonnie .
do you think she knows it &apos;s christmas ?
you know she never liked being away from us at christmas .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s probably better that she doesn &apos;t know , though .
so are you and damon--
i know what you &apos;re thinking ,
and no .
actually , i was going to say that
i think it &apos;s great how he &apos;s always been there for you when it mattered ,
you know , through thick and thin ,
good times and bad times .
maybe i haven &apos;t given him enough credit .
you &apos;re clearly malnourished .
bet you think you &apos;re pretty clever , don &apos;t you ?
is this damon ?
why don &apos;t i have your number saved ?
well , you weren &apos;t in your dorm room ,
and your pouty little goth friend wasn &apos;t in hers .
it &apos;s creepy you know where liv &apos;s dorm room is .
let me guess . you 3 idiots figured
that kai merging with jo benefits you and liv .
now i &apos;m not sure exactly how luke fits into that yet ,
but i &apos;ll use my imagination .
i &apos;m trying to keep my girlfriend alive .
sound familiar ?
we both knew that wasn &apos;t gonna work .
where &apos;s jo ?
i &apos;m not telling you ,
and before you threaten to rip my head off ,
remember , all that does is guarantee
kai having to merge with jo .
is that what you people think of me ,
that i just instantly resort to violence ?
i just have a question . i mean , look .
i get why you don &apos;t want to merge with liv , ok ,
because no one wants to see that face with her hair .
i get it , but what makes you think
kai merging with jo is any smarter ?
i mean , i heard he killed 4 of your siblings ,
and that was without magic .
eh , it &apos;ll be fine . i &apos;m sure when kai gets all that power
he &apos;s just gonna mellow right on out .
stop .
and here i thought we were meeting for tea and crumpets .
i &apos;m giving you information about a girl
who &apos;s supposed to be stefan &apos;s long lost niece .
i &apos;m not exactly interested in him finding out .
and why are you helping me ?
i thought you unfriended me
when i killed that little con artist .
monique . her name was monique .
eh , two names actually--
first sarah , then monique , probably others .
i asked you why you &apos;re helping me .
she knew something that stefan didn &apos;t want her to know ,
and for some screwed up reason ,
you &apos;re obsessed with knowing stefan &apos;s secrets .
probably because he has everything you &apos;ll never have .
answer the bloody question .
why are you helping me ?
because i want this obsession to take you the hell away from here .
this is all the information monique told me about her past .
take it and get out .
think i didn &apos;t plan for that ?
caroline could really use whatever &apos;s in that cup .
is it just me , or does that look really bad
for somebody who just fainted ?
that doctor just came over from radiology .
i overheard her say glioblastoma .
glioblastoma ? no , but that--
no .
no , no .
we brought her in a couple of weeks ago
after tripp &apos;s guys grabbed here .
doctors ran some tests ,
and apparently they found something suspicious .
no , but that doesn &apos;t make sense , stefan .
caroline would have said something .
or maybe her mom hasn &apos;t told her yet .
what &apos;s going on with liz forbes ?
her recent mri showed a lesion on her brainstem .
we think it &apos;s metastasized to her spine .
c @-@ c @-@ can you operate ?
if the tumor &apos;s already spread , it would be impossible .
but that would mean--
does she know ?
for a few weeks now ,
but news like this takes time to digest .
wouldn &apos;t it be a billion times easier
just to stake him in the heart ?
yeah , but he wouldn &apos;t suffer .
get the door .
wait . this isn &apos;t about making him suffer .
it &apos;s about making sure he doesn &apos;t kill anyone else .
he just killed an innocent girl , jer .
he deserves to suffer .
dude , you sound like tripp .
you mean the guy whose neck enzo slit open
for trying to protect innocent people ?
i &apos;m just saying you &apos;re being a little intense .
maybe that &apos;s the problem , jer .
we &apos;ve all been looking the other way
because we &apos;re friends with vampires ,
but how many people need to die
for us to face the fact that vampires also kill people ?
so what , you &apos;d do the same thing to stefan ?
what about elena or caroline ?
just help me get him to the van .
look . i know how you feel .
i was supernaturally programmed to take out my sister , remember ,
but this whole us versus them thing
is gonna drive you crazy ,
and it &apos;s gonna get you killed .
hey . it will be ok .
just needed to get rid of kai so you could free me .
look , jo . you can &apos;t run away from this anymore .
you &apos;ve had 18 years of freedom .
now take your magic back and do this .
you owe it to the coven .
is that what you think ,
that i &apos;ve been shirking my responsibility to our family ?
luke &apos;s all i &apos;ve got .
if we merge and he dies ...
i may as well be dead , too .
if kai merges with me ,
he &apos;ll be more powerful than any of us .
did it ever occur to you that
maybe you &apos;re strong enough to beat him ?
you were 22 the last time you went up against him .
since then , you &apos;ve been a combat medic ,
you &apos;ve saved hundreds of lives ,
and your hospital worships you .
someone &apos;s done her research .
you &apos;re my sister ,
and i &apos;m yours .
look how far you &apos;ve come without magic .
you didn &apos;t get here listening to people
tell you you weren &apos;t strong enough .
liv !
can &apos;t say i didn &apos;t warn her .
phesmatos superous em animi--
kai , stop !
isn &apos;t it gonna be funny when i kill her
using her own magic ?
wait . is that funny or sad ?
i get my emotions mixed up .
hey . what &apos;s the one for fire again ?
it &apos;s &quot; incendia , &quot; right ?
phesmatos ...
kai , enough !
lectos espiritox .
that &apos;s it ? we &apos;re gonna kill bad guys together ,
and you &apos;re not gonna talk to me ?
look . you blew up your car ,
you needed a ride .
doesn &apos;t mean we have to talk .
all right . look . i agree
that maybe compelling you to betray your lady
friend was an irrational decision
stemming from untreated control issues .
heh . ok .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry , ric .
is that it ?
yeah .
great . let &apos;s finish this .
there it is .
oh , so predictable .
i threaten liv , you do anything it takes to save liv .
fractos .
cemetery , really ?
motus .
oh , whoops .
looks like you found the antimagic border .
drew a line in the dirt for everyone &apos;s convenience . see ?
yeah . you &apos;re welcome .
thank you . kill him .
alaric , don &apos;t !
what are you talking about ?
she &apos;s lightheaded and confused .
i &apos;ll give her some of my blood , ok ?
kill him .
no , you can &apos;t .
if kai dies , liv and luke have to do the merge .
it &apos;s not fair to them .
who cares ? kill him .
ric , don &apos;t .
i can win . i can beat kai .
i just need a little time to get stronger .
we &apos;re moved . truly .
kill him now .
i &apos;ll figure out a way to win .
please you have to trust me .
keep him alive .
ric .
why the hell did you tell damon where they were ?
because i realized listening to you two was a huge mistake .
kai &apos;s a monster .
so you &apos;ll just risk your sister &apos;s life ?
how the hell does that make sense ?
hey ! i &apos;m talking to you .
everyone , chill !
jo thinks she can beat kai .
you and i both know that &apos;s crap .
kai &apos;s a million times stronger .
she &apos;ll die , and the first thing
kai &apos;s gonna do is kill everyone in our coven
as punishment for putting him away ,
and then he &apos;ll turn on innocent people
because he &apos;s crazy and bored and homicidal .
fine . then i &apos;m selfish , luke ,
but i &apos;d rather be alive and selfish
than this dead martyr who served her purpose to her coven .
people are gonna die ,
and it &apos;s gonna be our fault .
remember that .
are you ok ?
there &apos;s a 22 @-@ year @-@ old sociopathic witch
running around mystic falls right now .
that we have a plan for .
we &apos;ve dealt with every kind of evil there is ,
and we always have a plan ,
but this--
if caroline loses her mom ,
it &apos;ll destroy her .
i know .
she doesn &apos;t deserve this , elena .
she &apos;s a good person .
she &apos;s happy , she &apos;s kind .
i know .
i should tell her .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before she compels a doctor ,
and i don &apos;t want her finding out from a stranger , you know ?
let me do it .
no , stefan . you don &apos;t have to .
let damon know .
i should tell caroline .
i haven &apos;t been there for her .
caroline needed me , and i ran away .
so ... yeah , i have to do it .
i guess we &apos;ll just lock up your brother
until you two , you know ...
merge our twin powers during the next celestial event ?
yeah . there really is no sugarcoating that , is there ?
for the record , i &apos;ve dated doctors and lawyers
and a couple of artist types ,
but none of my previous boyfriends
would have ever understood that .
here . let me , uh ...
be careful .
so this whole antimagic thing ,
is it like a-- like a dome or a bubble ?
like , say , you were in 747 flying over mystic falls ,
would you die ?
you know , that could be dangerous ,
like if you &apos;re headed to new york
and your pilot reroutes for weather .
how &apos;s this ? i kill you , and when you &apos;re in hell ,
you can ask a bar full of dead travelers ,
who cast the damn spell .
that &apos;s a lot of travelers .
must be a pretty big spell .
like a really big spell .
so big ...
it covers every inch of an entire town .
what the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;m working on my knuckleball .
we are keeping him alive , damon .
can i ask why we continuously compromise logic
for some girl you just met ?
you know , i don &apos;t know how i went
so long without saying this ,
but you &apos;re a real dick .
bonnie &apos;s stuck over there because of him .
she &apos;s over there , and i &apos;m over here ,
and i hate myself for it .
yeah , and killing him will make you feel better ,
so let &apos;s just stop pretending for a second
that this is about anyone else but you .
you should probably go change that tire .
ok , tree . let &apos;s do this .
now that &apos;s what i call a christmas tree .
isn &apos;t that gorgeous ?
the holidays are all about being with loves ones ,
and i think that &apos;s what
makes this tradition so special in our town .
it &apos;s a reminder that no matter where you turn
you have a friend .
biggest mistake of junior year--
including the boys in secret santa .
stefan is officially the worst gift giver .
he got you a snow globe ?
yeah , of mystic falls ,
as if i don &apos;t see enough of this town every day as it is .
well , i love my bracelet .
of course you do because i am good at secret santa ,
and i didn &apos;t purchase it from a quick stop .
looks like someone is missing the true meaning of christmas .
come on . we &apos;re happy and healthy ,
and we &apos;re together .
uh , there &apos;s no news .
apparently , they &apos;re still running tests .
caroline , we need to talk .
hey . where are you ? i can &apos;t hear you .
i &apos;m at the medical center .
where are you ?
reception &apos;s horrible .
damon , can you hear me ?
hey . elena !
fancy something else ?
i always figured i &apos;d bow out to the everly brothers or--
he stopped talking .
he never stops talking .
magia tollox de terras .
utera aso utox .
what happened to his chains ?
is he chanting ?
utera aso utox .
magia tollox de terras .
utera aso utox .
it &apos;s a christmas miracle .
you little magic sucker .
sucked up all that magic from the traveler spell .
a lot of magic .
gah ! i really , really hate that move .
ric !
hey . come on .
take my damn hand , ric .
come on .
how are you not dead ?
if we &apos;ve learned anything from today ,
it &apos;s that we should kill our enemies with haste .
then what are you waiting for ?
go ahead and kill me .
i said enemies .
don &apos;t flatter yourself .
what do you want , enzo ?
you were right .
i am jealous of stefan .
he has what i want-- respect , family ,
girls he doesn &apos;t deserve .
he throws it all away , and yet still somehow
manages to come out winning .
you are going to help me deplete every ounce
of happiness from his life ,
and when there &apos;s nothing left ,
i &apos;ll decide if you get to live .
oh , and , uh ,
happy holidays .
you mean home home ?
just walked through the front door ,
which i probably start locking
now that kai &apos;s supercharged and on the prowl .
let &apos;s just celebrate the fact that we can go home .
i could really use some happy news right now .
today sucked .
i &apos;m listening .
so look . i don &apos;t know what we were or are
or what we &apos;re supposed to be ,
but all i know is that today was pretty horrible ,
and i just-- i want to see you .
i have something i need to tell you .
come over .
i &apos;ll cook you dinner , and we &apos;ll talk about our crappy days .
that just doesn &apos;t make sense .
my mom would have said something to me .
we were worried , so ...
elena compelled one of the doctors for information .
ok . so my mom has a brain tumor .
then we &apos;ll just give her vampire blood .
caroline , don &apos;t you think that if our blood cured cancer
we would have heard about that by now ?
fine . then when are they gonna operate ?
that &apos;s the problem . they can &apos;t .
ok . well , if they can &apos;t operate ,
then they &apos;ll give her chemo , right ?
the tumor is growing so fast
the doctors don &apos;t think that will work .
well , then they &apos;re wrong
because they don &apos;t know her .
they don &apos;t know how strong she is .
i mean , she &apos;s gonna get through this , stefan .
right ?
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s all right .
we miss you , bonnie .
i miss you guys .
that &apos;s not possible .
what ?
this was gone .
i blew this up .
yeah ? well , you weren &apos;t around to annoy me
for the last 4 months , so
i had a bit of extra time on my hands .
think of it as a
early merry christmas / late welcome back to life present .
thank you .
hey . just , uh , do me a favor .
don &apos;t die again .
those fenders were a real bitch to find .
deal .
deal .
yeah .
well , we &apos;re home .
yep .
you sticking around ?
well , that depends .
might have to kill jeremy if i find out that he slept in my bed .
mistletoe . clever .
hello . anybody there ?
damon , what are you doing ?
are you gonna let me in or ...
i may have put a cloaking spell on us .
how genius is that ?
