I have an eyewitness from the two crows diner.
You fit the description, and I'd like it
if you come in for a line-up.
I spoke to Jillian this morning.
I sort of ended up pitching you as co-writer.
Jillian approved the book.
That's amazing.
That's great.
I think the person the cops should
really be talking to is right over there.
You're welcome to stay here as long as you want.
Can you believe that it's been three years
since we were in Madrid?
That's crazy.
Were you looking to--
Get married. Tonight.
What is happenin'?
Oh, my God!
Aria!
Have either of you heard of a restaurant
called the Two Crows?
Is anybody in there? Hello?
The pull-up handle is missing a rod.
It could've been used as a weapon to crack someone's neck.
Sara Harvey wants this murder solved.
And whoever this was they want to cover it up.
There's now more than one person after us?
I wonder who took this one
Wait, there's more.
否则你输定了
Oh, my God!
Was it you?
Did you call Charlotte that night
from the Two Crows Diner?
Emily, I can't talk about this here.
Get in the car. Get in the car.
I called Charlotte the night she was killed.
Why?
I asked her to meet me.
At the church?
At the Two Crows.
I sat in that diner waiting for two hours.
She never showed up.
Look, if someone saw me on the phone, they saw me
sitting there by myself with a cup of coffee
and a slice of apple pie.
Was that your only time at the Two Crows?
Last Friday night someone tried
to run me over in the parking lot there.
I was still working for Yvonne's mother then.
Making phone calls in a room with half dozen volunteers.
You wanted Charlotte released.
That's why you had a change of heart in the hearing.
You were afraid Aria's story would convince the judge
to keep her in the hospital, where you couldn't get to her.
I wasn't trying to get to her.
I just wanted to talk to her, away from everyone else.
You understand that.
Sure.
After the special attention you got
at the bottom of a certain hole.
Not just me, Emily.
Charlotte Dilaurentis knew everything
About every one of us.
Every mistake, every lie, every crime.
And she never implicated us
the five years she was locked up.
She just sat in that hospital
ticking like a time bomb.
And what would you have done if she'd shown up?
Find out what she was gonna do with all her new freedom.
And if she said she was gonna tell everything
were you just gonna sit there eating your apple pie?
Maybe.
Or maybe you were thinking about
doing something to stop her.
Doesn't matter what I was thinking.
The fact is, she never showed up.
I'll drive you back.
What if it had been you?
What if you called her and she showed up?
What would you have done?
Mona basically told you she was ready to kill Charlotte.
Yeah, but she didn't, because Charlotte never showed up.
Not guilty because the victim didn't show?
That's setting the bar pretty low. Em
Innocent, guilty, whatever.
She admits to being the brunette on the phone.
Let-let's tell Tanner this, so I can get off the suspect list.
So do you think she's lying?
Pick a topic.
About Charlotte not meeting her that night.
That's probably true. It's too easy to check.
While you two are discussing this, let's remember
that I was the one that was in a line-up.
Alright? It's really unflattering lighting there.
So what, do we wait?
For what?
Whoever this is wants us to hand over
Charlotte's killer before election night.
And they're getting impatient.
Well, does anyone wanna put some ointment
on that impatience?
Look, a free-range Mona is more likely to lead us someplace.
Especially if she thinks we believe her.
So, we believe her?
We believe her enough.
I just think it's a good idea to stay in Rosewood
a little while longer.
Well, I'll meet them when I get back.
Well, then I'll meet them
The next time they're in New York.
Look, Tanner wants us to stay.
Well, your lawyers are there, and I'm here
so I have to go with my gut.
Well, if I was in New York, all I'd be thinking about
is Aria and the others.
Because they're my friends, Jordan.
Yes. You know I do.
Alright, I'll call you later. I love you.
So do I get an invitation to the wedding?
Of course, you do.
I was half expecting to meet Jordan when I got here.
Yeah, well, he's a little phobic of small towns.
He thinks they exist only to escape from.
I used to think that.
What changed your mind?
Big cities.
Oh, um, I picked up a few ties
that could go with the shirts I saw in your closet.
You did not have to do that.
Well, it's just a little thank you for letting me stay here.
Oh, and I put post-its on what goes with what.
Terrific. Garanimals for grownups.
Okay, so, I checked out the system.
And upgraded the firmware
And I took the fireplace off-line
till I could replace this controller.
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened but it will not happen again.
Lucas, you didn't have to come back for that.
I wouldn't have, but I had to be here anyway.
I'm checking out some property.
A house?
No.
Those empty factories and mills past the lake.
My accountants are telling me to spend money
and I figure if I can do something
with one of those little dinosaurs.
The accountants are happy
And the town gets a little bit of tax revenue.
Aww, local boy makes good.
Yeah. A little of that.
Maybe I'm giving this town a second chance.
I know what you mean.
When we finally got out of here, it was so fast.
We didn't really realize what we left behind.
So I will bring the new controller tonight.
Anything that Aria needs, just give me a call. Okay?
Okay.
It's very late.
We almost missed the breakfast part
of bed and breakfast.
People will wonder what we were doing up here.
People will know exactly what we were doing here.
What do you wanna do today?
I was thinking that we could find a lake
or a river and sit on the bank and read.
Or not read.
I'll dig up a French impressionist.
Pay him 50 bucks for a quick portrait.
Perfect.
Ali!
Why do I have to stay here?
Because you had a concussion.
I'm fine.
You will be, in a little while.
Why do I have to stay in the hospital?
You can take care of me, you're a doctor.
Which is why I think it's a good idea for you to stay put.
This is not where I wanted to spend my honeymoon.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
Oh, it's the manager of the inn, expressing her concern.
Well, I fell down her staircase, no wonder she's concerned.
They're checking the carpet and the bannister.
Look, I don't want to sue anybody.
I just wanna go on a picnic.
Which we will do, as soon as you're all checked out.
What is it?
I was really, really happy
the moment before I tripped.
And I wonder if that's why I fell.
Maybe every good thing has to be paid for by a bad thing.
That's not how the universe works.
Sometimes I feel like I'm being punished
for surviving. Still being alive.
Or maybe you just snagged
your shoe on the carpet.
And the planets did not align to give you a bump on the head.
It was an accident. That's all.
Babe, where's my phone?
She says it was an accident.
Do we believe that?
As much as I believe Aria being seared was an accident.
What do you think, Spence?
Uh, two out of five in the ER. That's 40 percent.
It's 60 if you count what happened to emily's eggs.
Well, the odds aren't gonna get any better
the closer we get to election night.
Three days.
Hey, so Ali's hospital is an hour away.
I think I'm gonna go check up on her.
She says she'll be back tomorrow.
Maybe she should think about going in the opposite direction.
Yeah, check on her, but don't freak her out.
And it might be best if she stays away
until after the election.
Hey, what do we do about mona?
Keep a close eye on her.
You guys, Mona did not kill charlotte. She couldn't.
She's got as much motive as anybody. Probably more.
She admits to getting Charlotte out of her house.
I mean, she's telling the truth, just not all of it.
Mona's changed so many times.
I doubt she even knows herself when she looks in the mirror.
Okay, who around here hasn't tried
to reinvent themselves a couple of times?
I'll call you after I go see Ali.
Uh, yeah, I will talk to Aria about it.
but, um, I will certainly be there.
Seven? Yeah, absolutely.
Alright, bye-bye.
Check with Aria about what?
Your boss wants to buy us dinner.
Jillian? Wh-where? When?
Tonight. At the Radley.
She was on her way to Toronto.
Through Pennsylvania?
Yeah, uh, I think she wants to see what she's buying.
Already?
Oh, no, not the book.
The authors.
Don't worry about it.
This is new territory for me.
Hey, you're doing great.
I may have dropped the ball.
What do you mean?
I didn't get this right.
Oh, this is the part where they say goodbye
where he drives off and looks back at her.
I thought you liked this.
Yeah, I-I liked it when we wrote it
but not so much when I read it.
Is-is it the part that I wrote?
No-no, it's, um...
Uh-uh, I-I set this up wrong.
Alright, well, I-I might be a little prejudiced.
but I think it's lovely.
Yeah, it is.
Okay, why don't you work on this?
I've got a lot to keep me busy.
Um, just, at least figure out what's bothering you about it.
Okay, I'm gonna try something.
Um, I'm gonna do it in the other room.
So did you feel dizzy or anything?
No, I felt fine.
All of a sudden, my feet were there
but the stairs weren't.
I'm so sorry, Ali.
It was just a stupid accident.
Do you like my honeymoon lingerie?
You look great.
Hey, what are the doctors saying?
They want me to stay because of the concussion
but they'll spring me tomorrow.
Back to the bridal suite?
Back to Rosewood.
Elliott got a call for a conference in Chicago.
They want him on the panel.
You're gonna be in Rosewood by yourself?
I don't mind.
For the first time...
that house really feels like mine.
God, all these flowers.
Did you fall down some stairs or enter the rose parade?
Elliott sent them.
All of them?
He's working on his husband creds.
Oh! Hi, newlywed.
Hanna.
Thank you so much for coming.
We stick together, you should know that by now.
These flowers are getting a little much.
Well, that's the goal.
We're not gonna be able to take all these home.
Well, we can distribute...
请求视频通话
I want you to see something.
Is that who I think it is?
Sara Harvey's helping hand.
What's Mona doing with him?
Good question.
Mona left him sitting on the bench.
Couple minutes later he got up and went inside.
You didn't hear anything that she said to him?
No, I was too far away.
But what is Mona doing with Sara's driver?
Well, I doubt she's asking him for a ride to the airport.
Like a meeting of the minions.
Yeah, could be.
Did he go in there with that tube?
No, he didn't.
I really wanna thank you for coming.
We weren't expecting it.
Well, no one likes to be in a hospital
especially away from home.
Um, this place is okay, is it?
You mean the hospital? Yeah.
I checked out the staff. Ali's getting the best.
I'm probably overreacting a bit
but I figure that's part of my job now.
And her concussion, they're gonna check on her.
Right? They're not gonna leave her alone?
They check on her and I'm with her most of the time.
Good.
I'm just starting to understand how loyal you are to Alison.
The way you look out for each other, it's remarkable.
Yeah, well, we're all connected like a big bowl of linguini.
Um, if she needs anything, call me.
I will.
Let me go get my car.
No, just wait a minute.
Now what?
Look, we can follow him around all day
but it's not gonna tell us what's inside that tube.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Oh, my God. Is this your car? We are so sorry.
This is entirely my fault.
It's totally her fault. I was trying to park.
And she was talking to me. And we just crashed.
You were asking me a question and I was--
It's nothing. Don't worry.
No, no, no, seriously.
No, no, no. I'm taking full responsibility.
I feel terrible. She feels terrible.
Just don't say it's okay if it's not.
It's okay.
No, it's really not. Please.
Will you just take a good look. I'm willing to pay for it.
I just want you to take a good look and make sure
that there's no real damage done.
Yeah, I mean, this is, like, my first accident ever
since I've been driving for, like, a year and a half
and I just, I really wanna make sure
that you take a good look and tell me
that there's no real damage.
'Cause, you know, insurance and everything
地下室
can get a little expensive...
I mean, I know how much my car means to me
and I'm sure you feel the same way, and...
Hey, is this suit Italian?
It's really soft.
I'd really like it if we could just solve this here
so we wouldn't have to drag it on.
It's nothing. I mean it. Don't worry.
You have no idea how happy I am to hear you say that.
So sorry.
I'm sorrier than she is.
Have a good rest of your day.
Bye.
Bye!
Do you think he remembered us?
No, it didn't seem like it.
So did you find anything?
Yeah, all roads lead back to Radley.
You're kidding.
You keep following our friend.
I'm gonna go back to city hall and see if I can get
a copy of what's in that tube.
Okay.
Okay.
I thought I could go, but I can't. I'm sorry.
No. No, no. But we-we planned this.
I should have left yesterday, but I was waiting for you.
Yeah, I know, but Blanca is sick.
I said I'd help with the kids, so..
But Blanca was taking care of those kids
a long time before we showed up.
Yeah, I know, but, baby, I promised.
Don't be selfish.
I-I'm not being selfish.
Yeah, you are.
Hey, what's wrong?
I really wanted to take you to the coast.
To all the glamor that is Lisiado Bay?
Y-y-yeah, Nicole, hot water
and a whole bathtub full of it.
O-okay, it's really, really tempting
but I made a promise.
You'll be back in three days. Don't be a baby.
Don't say that.
It's just a phrase.
Don't call me a baby when I just wanna
spend some time alone with you
in a room that has a lock and a floor.
Ezra.
Hey, I-I have an idea.
Just get in the jeep. Just get in the jeep.
please, please just get in the jeep.
I can't. I can't. I can't.
You can't or you won't?
Oh, come on. Don't make it like that.
Okay. Yeah, forget it.
What, you gonna drive the next six hours angry at me?
Yeah, probably.
Ezra, don't go like this.
If I don't leave now, I won't make it by nightfall.
Seriously, don't go like this.
Like what?
Okay, fine.
Fine.
and I got in the jeep and left.
made a really big deal of grinding all the gears
so she would know I was still pissed off.
I drove away.
No wave, no last look.
So that's what really happened.
Yeah. Not very romantic, is it?
I'm sorry.
You're a bad influence on me.
You make me want to be honest.
So, do we tell it the way it should've been
or do we tell it the way it happened?
We tell it the way that makes the best story.
Tell me I'm wrong about that.
Did Alison or Elliott see this?
I'm pretty sure they didn't.
Look, whoever this is is not gonna wait until election night.
They're gonna keep chipping away at us
until there's nothing left.
What did you tell the others about Ali's accident?
Nothing...yet.
I wanted to talk to you first.
Why me?
Because you're the only one who can help me with this.
What are we talking about?
Look, I thought about this a lot on the drive home.
The only way to prevent any more accidents
is to call this creep's bluff.
We have to tell them we're ready to give them what they want.
Hanna, what they want is Charlotte's killer.
Right. And that's who we give them.
Well, he didn't go that far out of town to get ice cream.
No, Sara just didn't want anybody seeing her get the key.
He probably checked in for her.
Em, uh, let's do this in person, okay?
Bye.
Hey. Uh, I was gonna call you.
Um...Did you see Ali?
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's okay. Um, it wasn't an accident.
Sara's back at the radley.
When did that happen?
Today.
She checked in under a fake name
and she's still looking for something.
These are plans for the radley
Same one Sara got from the records office.
Spence...You need to listen to Hanna.
That night, at the hotel, when you were asleep..
I left the room.
I followed Aria and Ezra.
And I saw them in the square and then..
I saw Charlotte go into the church.
So I went in after her.
She was sitting there. Alone. Praying.
I picked up a candlestick..
and I stabbed her
in the back of the neck with the end of it.
And then I took her to the bell tower and I threw her off.
I went to the hotel and pretended
like I was only gone for a minute to get ice.
Stealing that security drive
wasn't because Aria was on it.
It's because I'm on it.
I murdered charlotte.
See? She believed it.
And if she believed it even for a minute..
What the hell just happened?
Hanna knows how we can end this.
I really shouldn't encourage Aria's writing.
I was hoping to turn her into a world-class editor.
Well, you missed your chance. She's already a novelist.
Almost.
I'm curious about the process. How does it work with you two?
We're still figuring that out.
Really? I was hoping you had it down by now.
I have a marketing department chomping at the bit.
Well, we sort of, uh, spot the corners
of the mat for each other.
Just somebody that the other person can trust.
Makes it go a lot quicker than if we were alone.
Quicker is good.
But we're still taking our time
to get it right.
We don't wanna rush it.
yeah.
A-and I know that you've been carrying
that advance for quite sometime--
I didn't come here to lean on you two.
I came here to buy you dinner and wish you well.
and maybe lean just a little.
I have production decisions to make for next year.
And I don't like making that kind of commitment
without a manuscript in my hand. Even a rough one.
I need to see some kind of complete draft
and I need to see it soon.
Oh, you'll have it.
Good.
Whole thing sounds crazy.
It's not crazy.
We're building a rat trap.
And you are the cheese.
We have to do something unexpected
to knock them off balance.
Okay, so what if she confesses to killing Charlotte, and A
orders her to march into the police station and tell Tanner?
You think this person went to all that trouble
just to hand it over to the cops?
This is about revenge, not justice.
Still sounds--
'Crazy. Yes.'
We've established that, but Caleb and I
have it all figured out.
What do you think about all this?
I'm just happy
somebody else has come up with a plan
'cause I'm all tapped out.
Can it work?
Yeah. It can work.
Meanwhile, I'll work things from the Sara angle
and if we're lucky, we'll catch A.
If we're lucky.
Hanna has the plan and Caleb has the know-how.
And if we don't back them up
they're just gonna do it by themselves.
Is that true?
Yeah.
Um, most of what I need I-I can take off the shelf
but for the other stuff, I mean
it would really be helpful if I could talk to Toby.
Spence?
He needs to know what you're planning.
And I wanna show him those blueprints.
Hey, can I see that list?
Do you think Hanna's aware of the risk she's taking?
Yeah, Em, she knows.
And you're just gonna let the two of them run this?
It's their plan. What do you want me to do?
Wedge myself in between them on the sofa?
I-I'm a sort of a hip-hop luddite '
The thing they don't want you to know
is how ethereal the technology is.
I still think ink on acid-free paper is gonna win out.
You don't mind if Aria walks me home, do you?
Just to the elevators.
Oh, no.
Um, I'll meet you outside.
Okay.
Uh, Jillian, thank you again for dinner.
Thanks for the book.
I just want to let you know, from now on
you'll be communicating with my office directly.
You won't have to go through Liam on this project.
But I-I've been working with Liam the whole time.
I know. I had a talk with him when he came back.
It was clear to me he needed some distance. He agreed.
I think it's what's best for the book and everybody involved.
Oh...Alright.
Are you trying to pretend I don't know you and Liam
are what used to be called "an item?"
Give me some credit, Aria.
I guess we could've been a little more discreet.
You were very discreet, that's why everybody knows.
I'm depending on you to keep things in perspective
until the book is finished.
After that, you can do what you like with whomever you like.
But right now, I don't want this project derailed...by anything.
I understand.
I hope so.
I like your Ezra. He's smart.
And he can write, and the talk shows will love him.
they'll love both of you.
You and your ex-teacher are in for quite a ride.
Goodnight, Aria.
Goodnight..
Em?
Aria, are you still at dinner?
Hey, listen, you need to tell Ezra what's happening.
I know, but the situation's changing.
I'm at Spencer's.
Hanna wants to try something.
No, she just left with Caleb.
You-you need to hear this.
'Hanna wants to say that she killed..'
Of all the paintings in that museum
why did you wanna take this one home?
This little dog's been through a lot with me.
'he was on a calendar in the kitchen'
of one of my foster homes.
It was an old calendar, wrong year.
Nobody ever took it down until I did.
This is actually the only thing I took with me.
I sort of made him my little dog.
You still have the print?
I left it behind... in new york.
Well, your little dog is doing alright for himself.
He's hanging in prado
people are lining up to see him..
...Buying him in the gift shop.
Yeah, sometimes things work out.
I really wanna say thank you for last night.
For all the adventures, the museums today
even the bull fight.
It was all very--
chaotic?
No, it was impromptu.
Where do you wanna go?
For dinner?
No, after madrid.
Um...I'm not sure.
Maybe Morocco.
God, I envy you.
Ferry ticket doesn't cost that much.
Yeah, but I've got to be back in Georgetown
by the end of the month.
Then we'll skip Casablanca.
Hey, it's 10 o'clock.
Time for dinner.
Yeah.
Alright, I'll be back as fast as I can
but, uh, the more I get done tonight
the less I have to worry.
Right.
Sorry, I just wanted to make sure that worked
from anywhere in the apartment.
Hey, Caleb. Good to see you.
Good to see you.
I would ask how you're doing, but I'm a stockholder
so I already know.
Yeah, well, confidence is high.
Okay, um, I gotta go.
Okay.
Oh, do you lunch? We should do lunch.
Yeah, I lunch.
Then we'll lunch.
Okay. Bye.
Okay, you are completely safe.
Thank you.
Hey, what, what is this?
It's the empty factory I'm buying near the lake.
And this... is what it's gonna look like when it's finished.
That's really nice. What are you gonna do with it?
Anything I want to.
What would you do with it?
Indoor miniature golf.
No, seriously, what would you do?
If somebody said that you could try anything
you know, start your own business..
What would you do?
Don't kid like that, Lucas.
Who's kidding?
Well, I would set myself up
with some new designers. Start my own brand.
You know, get out of the city, away from all the distractions.
Deal.
Research and development.
It can mean whatever we say that it means.
Look, this will be a good way for you
to keep one foot in Rosewood.
Figure out what you left behind.
Lucas, I, I can't take you up on that offer.
Why not? What?
Does somebody else you went to high school with
wanna offer you a million-dollar line of credit?
Come on, Hanna.
Look, I finally figured out a way to give you something
that nobody else can.
Look, but the offer still stands.
Ask Jordan about it.
We can talk about it tomorrow or whenever you want.
Yeah. Tomorrow.
Don't be afraid. Please.
I don't wanna scare you.
I'm dreaming.
Or it's, it's the drugs or the concussion.
I don't care what it is.
I'm just glad I'm able to see you, to talk to you.
My little angel.
Mommy.
Everything's gonna be alright now.
Elliott will take care of you.
You know about Elliott.
I know he's a good man.
I know he loves you.
And he'll protect you the way that I wasn't able to.
Rest, darling.
You'll be happy now.
Someone told me you wanted to talk.
Hello, Sara.
I saw your driver this morning,
I was curious how you were doing.
Alright. Everyone has their own personal way to survive.
Well, when you consider what we've all been through
it's amazing we're all functioning so well.
What do you want, Mona?
Leave 'em alone.
Not until I get what's coming to me.
Charlotte's dead.
You can't get reparations from a corpse.
You can if you know where to dig.
Be careful.
No one blames you for what Charlotte made you do
But what you do now, that's all yours.
Poor Mona, out in the cold.
No matter what you do, they're never gonna trust you.
You played with them too long.
I'm not playing anything anymore, okay? No more games.
Then you're gonna be awfully lonely.
Well, so far I kinda like your boss.
Although I can see how she can be a bit daunting.
Jillian has daunt she hasn't even used yet.
What did you guys talk about in the lobby?
That was work related.
She wants me to go through the office, not Liam.
What else?
Nothing. Really.
Then why have you not looked me in the eye
since we left the hotel?
It's not about the book.
Emily called me.
Is something wrong?
Alison's in the hospital.
Is she back? What happened?
No, she's not back.
She's still away with Elliott.
Is she gonna be okay?
Yeah.
She had an accident, or what looked like an accident.
The same way that what happened to me looked like an accident.
A...Aria, w-what are you saying exactly?
I'm saying it's happening again
and we're gonna do something about it.
I didn't wanna wake you.
That's alright. I was dreaming.
I came in with good news.
We can go home in the morning. All tests are clear.
That's good.
And I made up my mind to cancel Chicago.
No, you have to go. It's important.
You're important.
Really, I'm gonna be okay now.
I mean it.
Go to the conference, so that when you get back
I can welcome you at the door and we can have a life.
What happened to you?
Nothing.
Everything.
I had a dream, that's all.
