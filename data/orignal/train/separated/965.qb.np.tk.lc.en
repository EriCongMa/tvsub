we had an agreement to keep things casual .
susan made her feelings clear .
so if i was with another woman , that wouldn &apos;t bother you ?
no , it wouldn &apos;t .
you work here ?
i &apos;m great with food . i understand business .
bree made orson a partner .
is she still asking you questions about me ?
a few .
and dave took steps to get karen mccluskey
out of the way .
you think you can screw with me ?
karen !
stop doing that .
as a masseur for the fairview country club ,
carlos solis had become an expert
on how to make women happy .
that &apos;s why he always had scented candles waiting for sue bridges ...
new age music for betsy daniel ...
and apple schnapps for shannon glenn .
yes , carlos had made a lot of women happy
over the years .
but on one very unusual wednesday afternoon ...
he made mrs. virginia hildebrand
a little happier ...
than he intended .
helen said your last reservation just canceled .
do you want a ride home ?
thanks , clay. that &apos;d be great .
um ... can i ask you something ?
how long you been a masseur ?
14 years .
okay. and in all those years ...
have you ever accidentally given a woman ...
an orgasm ?
an orgasm ? !
keep your voice down. you want to get me fired ?
how do you accidentally give a woman an orgasm ?
i don &apos;t know .
i can barely give my girlfriend one ,
and i try really hard .
all i did was touch her back .
are you sure ?
some of these old broads-- their bodies drop .
not everything &apos;s where it &apos;s supposed to be .
i may be blind , but my sense of touch is just fine .
well , then maybe she just really liked the massage .
you wouldn &apos;t believe the moaners i get on my table .
i &apos;m telling you , her body was quivering ,
and she could barely breathe .
all right , well , there &apos;s one sure @-@ fire way to find out .
where &apos;s your tip envelope ?
on the counter .
how much she leave me ?
enough for two orgasms .
yes ...
carlos solis was an expert on how to make women happy .
i &apos;m about to go get groceries. where are your tips ?
oh , my god ! how did you get so much ?
and he knew the best way to keep his wife happy ...
just ... good at my job .
was to lie .
there are dangerous women in this world--
devious predators waiting to strike .
you can spot them by the lipstick they use ,
the shoes they wear
and the perfume they choose .
but the easiest way to spot a dangerous woman
is to see how she behaves ...
i am about to make you so happy .
with another woman &apos;s husband .
amy , don &apos;t worry about the lunch specials .
i am only two blocks away . i &apos;ll take care of it once i ...
actually , you do them . i &apos;m gonna be a while .
tom ?
h--lynette , hey. what--what are you doing here ?
so funny . i was gonna ask you the same question .
but i was gonna start with &quot; what the hell ? &quot;
you remember anne , right ? anne schilling .
kirby &apos;s mom .
we were room parents together in the third grade .
right .
so ... what the hell ?
tom , why don &apos;t we just show her ?
it &apos;s for my band .
anne has been helping us find a rehearsal space .
that &apos;s right. you &apos;re a realtor .
now i know what you &apos;re thinking .
it seems like a waste of money .
but i just got them to reduce the rent
and throw in the utilities .
and you &apos;re always complaining about the noise
when we practice in the garage , so , you know ...
what do you think ?
i think ...
it &apos;s great .
you do ?
yeah. ah !
wonderful .
yeah .
listen , i have to be somewhere by 10 : 00,
so why don &apos;t we sign a lease right now ?
wow ! i @-@ i was convinced
that you would think it was a dumb idea .
well ... it &apos;s a little dumb ,
but compared to what i was thinking ...
what were you thinking ?
well , it &apos;s just ...
i saw you two together , and i ...
i didn &apos;t know that you were ... and she looks so ...
for god sakes , tom , the woman has to be somewhere .
just sign the damn lease .
so out of nowhere , jackson says , &quot; let &apos;s move in together . &quot;
i @-@ i mean , of course i was stunned .
and then when i said no , he just broke up with me .
i mean , does he really expect me to be in love
after just five months ? that &apos;s crazy .
yeah , i guess ,
although his work on these moldings is amazing .
you really want me to repaint these , suzanne ?
it &apos;s susan .
and he was the first one to say
he didn &apos;t want to get serious .
which is why i was happy. we were just having fun .
well , maybe you should call him .
how do you like this color ?
not so much .
frank , how can i call him ?
he &apos;s the one that ended it with me .
look , the guy makes you happy .
he says he loves you .
you gonna let pride stop you
from finding out where this thing could go ?
come on .
don &apos;t be stupid .
how much am i paying you ?
$ 14 an hour .
that &apos;s not enough .
no , ma &apos;am , it &apos;s not .
carlos , what are you doing home ?
uh , virginia insisted on giving me a ride .
you must be gabrielle .
carlos has told me so much about you .
i &apos;m virginia hildebrand .
oh ! you are the mrs. hildebrand .
well , you &apos;re carlos &apos; favorite client .
well , mine , anyway .
i bought this top with that crazy tip you gave him .
your carlos has helped my back problems
like no masseur i have ever had .
i &apos;m pain @-@ free for the first time in years .
oh , that &apos;s carlos for you. mr. magic hands .
he hits the ol &apos; sweet spot every time .
okay , gaby .
i should go now ,
but promise you &apos;ll at least consider my little proposal .
what proposal ?
i hate to stop when we &apos;re making so much progress ,
but i need to go to europe for two months ,
mostly london and rome .
i &apos;d be so grateful
if carlos were to accompany me as my personal masseur .
two whole months ?
see ? i told you. it &apos;s too long , and gaby has the girls and--
i know it &apos;s a lot to ask ,
which is why i &apos;m offering carlos $ 50,000 .
$ 50,000 ?
per month .
well , pip @-@ pip and arrivederci !
gaby .
i &apos;ll leave you two to discuss it .
well , uh , what &apos;s to discuss ? for that kind of money ,
you can lock him in a cage and feed him peanuts .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow , carlos. lovely meeting you , gaby .
carlos , don &apos;t even think about saying no to this !
she is not my only client .
i &apos;ll be letting down the rest if i go .
mr. banks could even fire me .
oh , don &apos;t worry about mr. banks .
i &apos;ll take care of him .
gaby !
and so what if he fires you ?
once virginia tells all of her rich lady friends
about what you did for her ,
they &apos;ll be lining up around the block .
great .
hey , great news .
i just got a call from my old friend , peter hickey .
i don &apos;t recall ever hearing that name before .
he &apos;s a friend from college. anyway , he mentioned that
his parents &apos; 50th anniversary was next month ,
and i convinced him to let us cater it. dinner for 80 .
he shoots , he scores !
orson ! you are amazing !
one week on the job ,
and he &apos;s already bringing in huge accounts .
that &apos;s great .
well , better go marinate those scallops
for the lunch tomorrow .
oh , scallops ? done .
done ?
mm. oh , i also made the pesto mayonnaise ,
and i put the individual cobblers in their ramekins .
oh. well , it looks like we &apos;re all set until the morning then .
hey , why don &apos;t you , uh , take the afternoon off ?
and do what ?
i don &apos;t know--read , relax , give yourself a pedicure .
fine .
what do you bet i take my socks off
and see orson &apos;s already done it for me ?
what are you doing ?
refrigerator needs cleaning .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
and besides , i gave you the day off. now go home .
i &apos;m thinking about moving to maryland .
maryland ?
mm @-@ hmm. dylan &apos;s there with her husband ,
and the baby &apos;s coming soon .
maybe it &apos;s time for me to go inflict myself on them .
you can &apos;t just up and move .
you have a life here .
no , i don &apos;t . i have a job--period .
no kids to raise , no husband , no boyfriend .
might as well throw in the towel and ... go be a grandma .
katherine , you are a vibrant , attractive woman. you--
who hasn &apos;t had sex in two years .
that spells &quot; grandma &quot; to me .
i haven &apos;t made up my mind yet. just let me think about it .
and help keep me busy .
when you &apos;re done with that ,
the oven could use a really good scrubbing .
bless you .
karen ?
oh. those must &apos;ve set you back a chunk .
yes , they did ...
not that you deserve them .
i don &apos;t blame you for being mad .
i &apos;m not mad .
i &apos;m furious .
now what the hell were you thinking ,
coming at my husband with a baseball bat ?
i know . i &apos;m really sorry , edie .
the doctor had me on these new meds ,
and it made me loopy .
i thought dave was messing with my head ,
and all the time , it was the damn pills .
well , i hope you stopped taking them .
you bet .
i had to get my marbles back .
uh , look , i know you just got here ,
but i am so sleepy and ...
of course . i &apos;ll see you when you get home .
actually , i &apos;m gonna call my sister
and see if i can stay with her for a while .
i don &apos;t think i should be on my own just yet .
okay. then i &apos;ll see you whenever .
oh , be sure and tell dave how sorry i am .
he will be so glad .
he &apos;s really fond of you , you know .
oh , come on , come on , come on , come on .
hey , sis. it &apos;s karen .
do me a favor and get your sorry ass over to
fairview memorial hospital a.s.a.p.
i need you big @-@ time , kiddo .
come in .
hi . i &apos;m looking for orson hodge . i &apos;m peter hickey .
oh ! yes , of course. uh , i &apos;m his wife bree .
i &apos;m afraid he &apos;s out running errands ,
but he &apos;s told me all about you .
oh ? yes. he said you were roommates back in college .
yes , we were .
have a seat .
anyway , my parents &apos; 50th anniversary is coming up ,
and i thought i &apos;d surprise them with a family reunion .
what a thoughtful son you are .
so , uh , have you given any thought to the venue ?
uh , yes . i have a summer place up in lake pleasant .
ah , pretty sure the terrace fits eight tables of ten .
that &apos;s a nice little terrace .
well , we will throw you a party so special
that you &apos;ll want us to cater your anniversary , too .
uh , actually , i &apos;m not married .
well , let &apos;s talk about food .
with a new client ,
what i usually do is discuss possible menus ,
and then i have my very best chef
prepare a sample dinner .
&quot; sample dinner &quot; ?
we don &apos;t do sample dinners .
but this is orson &apos;s college roommate .
and ... he &apos;s quite the catch !
oh , wait a minute .
is this a setup ? because i loathe blind dates .
well , that &apos;s what &apos;s so great about it .
technically , it &apos;s a business dinner .
it has all the potential upside of a date
while still being tax @-@ deductible .
fine . i will cook for the man .
but i am not going to get dressed up ,
i &apos;m not going to put on makeup , and i am not going to flirt .
he came while orson was out .
i let him record a message on my phone .
orson , sorry i missed you , buddy .
catch you next time , okay ?
you realize you could have just led with this
and saved us this whole discussion ?
jeez , roberta !
put that damn thing out. you &apos;re not in a corner saloon .
then how come there &apos;s bourbon in my coffee ?
do i have to call a nurse ?
fine . i drove 80 miles to see you , karen .
you better be dying , or you &apos;re gonna pay for my gas .
i &apos;m not dying , but there &apos;s someone who sure wishes i was .
son of a bitch landed me in here .
you tell me where to find him . i &apos;ll clean his damn clock .
no , we &apos;ve got to be careful with this guy .
mm. he &apos;s dangerous .
that &apos;s what you said about that biker in florida
who now has to puree all his food .
hmm , nearly forgot about him .
that was a fun vacation .
so what do you need me to do ?
let me come stay with you when i get outta here .
this guy thinks i &apos;m out of commission ,
and i want to keep it that way .
and you can help me do some digging .
you still work for that cell phone company ? the ...
teleshore. yes , god help me .
good. pull his records and see what turns up .
the name is dave williams .
how do you know he &apos;s with teleshore ?
i went through his mail .
god , you remind me of mom .
so what else you need ?
could you smuggle me in a cold brewski ?
boy , no one knows you like family .
jackson ? it &apos;s me .
hello ?
that &apos;ll work .
are you okay ?
i think so .
good .
so who the hell are you ?
darcy. who the hell are you ?
susan , jackson &apos;s girlfriend .
he never said anything about a girlfriend
when we hooked up at the club .
well , when guys go slut @-@ hunting ,
they tend not to play the girlfriend card .
did you just call me a slut ? !
you met the guy tonight. now you &apos;re in his shower .
i &apos;m just doing the math .
got the pizza. oh ... crap .
so we break up ,
and 15 minutes later you &apos;re with someone else ?
you got over me fast .
i &apos;m surprised it took 15 minutes .
stay out of this .
susan , why are you here ?
i wanted to talk about our future .
you--you said you didn &apos;t want a future .
well , i was starting to change my mind ,
and then i show up
and find 5 feet of lip gloss in the shower .
i brought hot wings. you &apos;re not getting any .
hi. what &apos;s that for ?
i was gonna use it
to wash down a bottle of sleeping pills
the next time your husband &apos;s &quot; band &quot;
defiled another rock classic .
but since you got them a rehearsal space ,
i thought we could share it over ice .
come on in .
hey. we &apos;re taking off .
remember , i &apos;m spending the night at kirby &apos;s house .
oh , right. and , kirby , tell your mom thanks .
that place she found for tom is already paying off .
yeah , she said she was there yesterday
and said it was looking pretty cool .
sh @-@ she was there ? why ?
she was just dropping off some old furniture for mr. scavo--
a couple chairs , lamp , futon .
well , see you tomorrow .
okay. drive safely .
yeah .
um ... neat or rocks ?
rocks .
so why does tom need a bed in his rehearsal space ?
not a bed-- a futon , like a couch .
that folds out to a bed .
what are you saying ?
well , if it &apos;s just a couch , why didn &apos;t tom tell you about it ?
how do you know he didn &apos;t ?
i don &apos;t. did he ?
no .
well , good for you .
good for you
for not worrying about your husband &apos;s bachelor pad .
you are not the teeniest bit paranoid , and i say brava .
now why aren &apos;t we drinking ?
not bad ! i mean , we were really cookin &apos; there .
tom , you got any beer in the fridge ?
i got nothing but beer in the fridge .
all right , everyone , go grab a cold one .
you earned it. you sounded great .
oh , do we blow .
oh , yeah .
not you , though .
man , you got the heart of a real blues guy .
ah , that &apos;s what five years in prison &apos;ll do to ya .
oh , yeah . i heard about that. still ...
it &apos;s fun , isn &apos;t it ?
highlight of my week .
you know , uh ... i was thinking ,
maybe we should bump up our rehearsal schedule ,
you know , to start working the kinks out .
ah , twice a week &apos;s about all i can handle .
what are you doing that &apos;s more important than this ?
well , let &apos;s see. my job , my son .
uh ... also , i just ... met this woman .
oh , no , dude , not blowing us off for a girl .
buddy , i just started seeing her , all right ?
it &apos;s kind of important
for the whole &quot; getting back on the horse &quot; thing .
right , what about saturday afternoon ?
i mean , come on , man. we gotta do this .
why ? you &apos;re putting a lot of time and effort
into a neighborhood garage band .
why is it such a big deal to you ?
it &apos;s not .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m just having a real good time .
all right , boys ! what do you say ?
we gonna drink beer or we gonna play some rock &apos; n &apos; roll ?
tom , where are you ?
hey , babe , we just really at rehearsal ,
and i think we &apos;re gonna play for a couple more hours .
anyway , i just wanna say don &apos;t wait up for me .
and i will , um , i &apos;ll see you in the morning , okay ?
okay. bye .
oh , my god .
lynette !
you said you were rehearsing .
i know . i know .
the guys--the guys left , and i just figured i &apos;d , uh ...
hang out for a little bit .
why can &apos;t you do that at home ?
what the hell is this ?
you moving out on me ?
why would i move out ?
so you can have your affair--
you know , the one that follows the sports car
and the garage band
and wanting to quit your job ,
the final stage of your midlife crisis .
oh , and then ...
when i hear anne schilling has been dropping by--
lynette ! she had a bunch of old , crappy furniture in her garage .
i bought it for 50 bucks .
you don &apos;t really think that ...
these past few months ,
when we &apos;ve been fighting about the car and the road trip ,
part ... part of me thought
that you were just complaining to complain ,
trying to ruin my fun .
but if it &apos;s affecting you like this ,
if it &apos;s making you actually think
that i would hurt you in that way ,
i &apos;m done with all of this .
so you &apos;ll come home ?
of course .
let me just square all this stuff away , okay ?
and then i will see you there .
good .
maybe when you come home ,
you could teach me how to play that video game .
that &apos;d be great .
hey , clay. is mr. banks around ?
uh , he &apos;s not back from lunch yet. what &apos;s up ?
oh , i need to sweet @-@ talk him
into giving carlos two months off .
oh , you two going away somewhere ?
no , just carlos .
mrs. hildebrand is taking him to europe
as her personal massage therapist .
personal massage therapist ?
paying him a fortune. but he &apos;s worth it .
i mean , what he &apos;s done for that woman ,
no one else has been able to do .
so ... he told you about that ?
they both did. you should have seen the woman ,
looking at carlos , gushing like crazy .
and you &apos;re okay with them going away together ?
why should i be jealous ?
the woman &apos;s , like , 60 .
if she gets off on carlos &apos; magical touch ,
what do i care ?
yeah. well , you &apos;re broad @-@ minded .
you know , if my girlfriend knew
that my massages were giving a woman orgasms ,
no matter how old she was--
whoa , whoa , whoa. nobody used the &quot; o &quot; word .
he didn &apos;t mention that ?
no ! he &apos;s giving her orgasms ? !
nah , not deliberately !
uh , he swears he &apos;s only been doing his standard massage .
oh , i bet he does ! where is he ? is she here now ?
oh , no , no .
she prefers her place , so she &apos;s been sending a car for him .
where ? where does she live ?
it &apos;s that big house . on the corner of lake and pinehurst .
i &apos;m sorry , gaby. is there anything i can do ?
hmm. well , when the time comes , an alibi would be nice .
we need to talk .
sorry. bad time .
i have the mailman upstairs in my tub .
you know what ?
you have no right to be mad at me .
i don &apos;t ?
i try to commit to you , and you push me away .
i try to move on , and i &apos;m a shallow jerk ,
what the hell are you doing ?
yeah , i have been married twice ,
and both times that &apos;s imploded ,
so really , i feel like ...
love is not my friend .
you know , i @-@ i wish that i could say it was just rotten luck ,
but ...
i just am thinking that ...
i can &apos;t do this .
you can &apos;t ?
i @-@ i never even had a real girlfriend before i met you .
i didn &apos;t want one .
and the first time i try to commit , bam ! i get smacked .
look , i don &apos;t even know where we are anymore .
we really messed this up , didn &apos;t we ?
pretty much , yeah .
we just have so much baggage .
i wish we could start over .
can we start over ?
hello ?
hi. uh , is susan meyer there ?
may i ask who &apos;s calling ?
this is jackson ... braddock .
uh , we met once . i don &apos;t know if you remember me .
i have brown hair .
uh , yeah . i think i remember you .
well , anyway , i thought we really clicked ,
so i was wondering
if you might want to have dinner with me .
okay .
when ?
tomorrow .
i know this great mexican--
french place .
sounds great .
pick me up at 7 : 00 .
great .
where do you live ?
may i help you ? excuse me .
i am gabrielle solis .
perhaps you know my husband ? he &quot; rubs &quot; your boss .
where are they ?
i am under strict instructions not to disturb mrs. hildebrand .
you can wait here .
fine .
when the cops bust up this brothel ,
i &apos;m gonna tell them you &apos;re the madame .
that &apos;s it , right there .
you sure this isn &apos;t too rough ?
mmm. no way .
go deeper . i can take it .
ahh. hold on .
i &apos;ve got a crick. i ...
carlos , i just remembered
i had an important business call to make .
could you give me the room for a minute ?
absolutely .
mrs. solis , what are you doing here ?
i know what you &apos;ve been up to , and shame on you .
what are you talking about ?
i know about ... the big &quot; o . &quot;
oh , dear. he could tell ?
i &apos;m beyond mortified .
i understand your concern ,
but i assure you it was only that one time .
it &apos;s never happened again .
and it never will
because if you think i &apos;m gonna let you drag carlos off to europe , you &apos;re nuts .
i suppose i should be flattered
that a woman as young and beautiful as you
should see me as a threat .
but it would be a shame to let it end a friendship
that &apos;s come to mean so much to me .
maybe a little too much .
mrs. solis , my husband &apos;s gone .
i &apos;m estranged from my family .
if you live with loneliness long enough ,
it becomes an ache inside you-- an actual physical pain .
i thought i &apos;d live with that pain the rest of my life .
then your husband healed me .
can you blame me for being grateful ?
no , but i just think we should end things
before they get any weirder .
carlos tells me you used to be a fashion model .
i &apos;ve always had a passion for clothes .
the reason i &apos;m going to europe is
to see the couture collections in paris and milan .
lucky you .
it &apos;s not so much fun going alone .
but if i had a knowledgeable companion like you
to be my guide ...
in fact , you could be my personal shopper .
that is ,
if you don &apos;t mind being paid in dresses .
gosh , that &apos;s a ...
a hell of a sweet offer ,
but i &apos;ve ... got the girls , and , um ...
we &apos;ll bring them along .
think what fun we &apos;ll have dressing them up .
what the hell ? you &apos;re never too young to see paris , right ?
i &apos;m so glad !
i can see we &apos;re going to be great friends .
carlos ! i &apos;m done with my call .
hello !
hey , hon. check this out .
if it &apos;s the cat eating spaghetti ,
i &apos;ve already seen it .
it &apos;s our band logo .
we &apos;re thinking of getting t @-@ shirts made up .
&quot; blue odyssey &quot; ? who came up with that ?
this was the name of my brother &apos;s band
when he was in high school .
you have a brother ?
had. he died .
well , you never told me about him .
what happened ?
his name was steve .
he was a great guy ...
just kinda got caught up in drugs and couldn &apos;t get out .
he went to prison , and when he was there ,
he was killed ... by another inmate .
and what happened to the guy who killed him ?
oh , the court ruled it self @-@ defense ,
so the guy finished his time , and he got out .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;ve never told me about him .
i mean , it might help you to talk about stuff like that .
i have my own way of dealing with it .
oh , sorry i &apos;m late .
that rehearsal was awesome .
they &apos;re letting me sing lead vocal
on &quot; hotel california . &quot; oh , that &apos;s nice .
hey , was there a blue convertible
parked in front of katherine &apos;s ? yes , there was. nice one .
my god , he &apos;s still there. who &apos;s still there ?
well , katherine &apos;s been lonely , so i set her up with a client ,
and he &apos;s been there for over four hours ,
so you know it &apos;s going well ! good for you !
my clever little matchmaker .
mmm. ohh. mwah. well , you deserve some credit , too .
i mean , you brought us peter &apos;s business .
peter ? peter hickey ?
yes .
you set him up with katherine ? is that bad ?
potentially .
is he gay ?
ugh ! i knew he had too much product in his hair .
no , it &apos;s just that when i booked the anniversary party ,
i didn &apos;t want you to be uncomfortable around peter ,
so i said we &apos;d met in college ,
which is not actually the case .
well , where did you meet ? prison .
peter &apos;s a felon ?
but he &apos;s so refined , so handsome .
two qualities that did not serve him well behind bars .
my god , orson. what kind of criminal is he ?
a killer or a rapist ? oh , no , no , no , nothing like that .
they got him for organ trafficking .
what ? !
he was a surgeon , and it seems
that when the opportunity presented itself ,
he &apos;d harvest the odd liver or kidney
from a deceased patient
and then sell it on the black market. are you telling me
that i set katherine up with a convicted graverobber ?
well , you said yourself ,
women over 40 can only be so choosy .
that is not funny ! i have to go warn katherine .
hello ?
katherine , hi !
is everything all right over there ?
yes , everything &apos;s fine .
then why are you whispering ?
peter just fell asleep . i don &apos;t want to wake him .
oh , my god .
you slept with him ?
you can wag that finger all you like .
i &apos;ve got just six words for you , bree hodge ...
thank you , thank you , thank you !
oh , i just really wish you &apos;d taken things more slowly .
bree , you have given me the most magical night i &apos;ve had
since i don &apos;t know when .
are you gonna make me feel bad about it now ?
no , i &apos;m not .
oh ! he is just so wonderful .
i tell you , if i &apos;m not careful , this guy could steal my heart .
well , if he tries , just promise you &apos;ll call .
sorry i &apos;m late .
i was sleeping so soundly .
peter didn &apos;t want to wake me .
what &apos;s this ?
a cosmopolitan. that &apos;s your favorite , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s 10 : 00 a.m. i don &apos;t want a drink .
you will .
but ... these homeless people whose kidneys he bought--
he at least paid them well , right ?
oh , i am so , so sorry .
oh , it &apos;s not your fault. you didn &apos;t know .
i have no one but myself to blame .
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m going to maryland .
you can &apos;t just move because of one bad date .
you don &apos;t get it .
when we started this , you were just as lonely as i was--
orson in jail , benjy gone .
and i felt bad for you ,
but , boy , was it nice to have somebody in the same boat .
and then orson got out , and now he &apos;s here all the time .
and i feel like you &apos;re this ...
fun , happy power couple ,
and i &apos;m just this needy , pathetic idiot ...
who hops into bed
with the first pancreas thief who kisses her .
i should be with family .
and i &apos;m not family ?
katherine , all my life , i wanted a sister .
and now i feel like i finally have one .
but we &apos;re always fighting and competing with each other .
well , what could be more sisterly than that ?
i know i &apos;m not the most ...
demonstrative ... person , but i care about you deeply ,
and if you were to just walk out of my life ,
i would be very ...
very unhappy .
well , i wouldn &apos;t want that .
good .
well , now that that &apos;s settled ...
let &apos;s make some pies. okay .
can i have another cosmo ?
no .
hey , is porter still at kirby &apos;s ?
yeah .
what &apos;s wrong with you ? you &apos;ve been antsy all night .
nothing. no , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
okay , i know what it is .
i have had this nagging feeling that
i &apos;ve forgotten something , and then i just realized
i think i left the freezer door at scavo &apos;s open. you sure ?
no. that &apos;s why it &apos;s gonna drive me crazy .
i better go down there and check. mmm .
okay .
hurry back .
i &apos;m so glad you were able to get away .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d make it .
i &apos;m glad my parents still think
i &apos;m young enough for sleepovers .
crap ! it &apos;s my dad !
dad , hi . i was just--i was just ...
i know what you were &quot; just . &quot;
when i found this , i thought ,
oh , great !
one of the guys in the band is having an affair .
and then it hit me-- porter has a key .
where is she ?
oh. dad .
don &apos;t .
she isn &apos;t wearing anything , all right ?
who is she ?
just some girl from english class .
you--you don &apos;t know her .
i &apos;m gonna go in the bathroom .
you got 60 seconds to get her out of here .
oh. hey , mike .
wow. look at you all dressed up .
oh , i was , um , kind of on a date .
oh. how did it go ?
pretty bad .
basically , she just grilled me all through dinner--
what do i think about this ? what would i do if that ?
i barely even know her .
i felt like i was on trial for my life. oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i just wanted somebody nice to have a cup of coffee with .
i guess that &apos;s too much to ask .
well , it &apos;s kinda late for coffee , but ...
i do have lemonade .
i &apos;d settle for lemonade .
hey , you know ,
i know it seems like i am being hard on you ,
but like i told you before ,
i don &apos;t think
that you &apos;re emotionally ready for sex .
i know. you said .
just making sure you heard me .
now go to bed .
it &apos;s late .
want me to , uh ,
put the car cover on for you first ?
sure. thanks .
you shouldn &apos;t be here. someone might recognize your car .
is everything okay ?
yeah. my dad doesn &apos;t suspect anything .
i &apos;m sorry if i got you in any trouble .
it &apos;s okay. you &apos;re worth it .
there are dangerous women in this world .
some are lovers ,
blind to the consequences of their actions .
some are wives enraged by the betrayal
of those they trusted .
others are predators ,
deviously setting traps to get what they want .
if you &apos;re unlucky enough to come upon
one of these dangerous creatures ,
the safest thing to do ...
i pulled those records you asked for .
looks like your mr. williams is keeping a little secret .
