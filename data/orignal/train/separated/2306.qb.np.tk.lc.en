for over a century ,
i have lived in secret-- until now .
i know the risk , but i have to know her .
elena , she &apos;s a dead ringer for katherine .
our love for katherine wasn &apos;t real , damon .
it was real for me .
i &apos;m going to bring her back .
there &apos;s a tomb underneath the church .
a spell sealed katherine in that tomb , protecting her .
tell me how to get in the tomb .
the grimoire .
where is it ?
check the journal . jonathan gilbert &apos;s .
the grimoire . it was emily &apos;s , right ?
that &apos;s what you need to reverse the spell .
i &apos;ll help you .
you just couldn &apos;t live without me , huh ?
your eye !
where &apos;d she go ?
where &apos;d who go ?
anna .
elena !
i wouldn &apos;t .
don &apos;t try to escape .
don &apos;t even move .
do you uerstand ?
i understand .
seriously ? !
i told her not to move !
i did that eye thing you taught me .
you forgot the lesson about vervain .
she takes a vampire venom , duh !
who are you ? what do you want ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
bonnie ?
oh , my god !
anna took elena .
yeah , i got that from your 600 voicemails .
damon , all night long , every single street in town ,
i &apos;ve been searching .
what if your blood hasn &apos;t passed out of her system ?
well , then at least you know you &apos;ll see her again .
please .
what do you know ?
you were with anna . you must know where she &apos;s living .
just tell me where i can find her .
nope . you can go .
really .
you know , all i can remember is hating you .
there might have been a time when that was different ,
but your choices have erased anything good about you .
but see , i also know that you have
just as much reason to hate me .
this all began with me .
katherine got taken away from you
because me .
and i &apos;m sorry .
apology accepted .
so please ,
just tell me what you know .
it &apos;s elena , damon .
if you know something ... tell me .
i mean this sincerely .
i hope elena dies .
bonnie .
elena ?
oh , you &apos;re ok !
my head ...
come here .
oh , my god ! ben is a--
shh . they can hear .
i was so stupid !
oh , he had all of us fooled .
what &apos;s going on ? why are we here ?
it must have something to do with
the tomb and emily &apos;s spell book
spell book ?
damon said that it could be used to open the tomb .
why didn &apos;t i know about any of this ?
i was trying to keep you out of it ,
hoping it would never come to this .
come to what ?
they need a witch ...
to break the spell and let the vampires out .
no way .
i know--
you &apos;re wasting your time .
i &apos;m not going to help you .
that &apos;s why she &apos;s here .
motivation for you to behave .
you know , you shouldn &apos;t be so desperate .
you made it too easy .
she wants to talk to you .
elena gilbert .
you really are katherine &apos;s doppelganger .
you must have the salvatore boys reeling .
who are you ?
i &apos;m anna .
your brother may have mentioned me .
i mean , we &apos;re , like , practically dating .
ten kegs ?
you know how much damage we could do with ten kegs ?
duke &apos;s got it all hooked up .
duke &apos;s a douche .
yeah , a douche with ten kegs .
aka , my new best friend .
what &apos;s the problem , gilbert ?
don &apos;t have one , lockwood .
yeah , i didn &apos;t think so .
you ever get bored of it ?
of what ?
yourself ?
keep laughing , buddy .
hey , jeremy .
where is elena ?
i have been texting her and bonnie
all day about duke &apos;s party .
uh , she went somewhere with stefan .
i am so not going to be one of those girls
who disappears just because she has a new boyfriend .
who is duke ?
some guy that graduated a couple years ago .
and he throws a party every time he comes home from duke .
wait , duke goes to duke ?
his real name is bob or something .
he &apos;s a total ass . but he buys the beer .
maybe you should come .
uh , yeah . - i don &apos;t think so .
no , seriously . everyone goes .
even quiet loner little brothers .
think about it .
so i have speech .
it is fully scripted and well @-@ rehearsed .
are you ready for it ?
you wrote a speech ?
yes .
it &apos;s a &quot; you kissed me
and i don &apos;t want things to be weird &quot; speech .
it &apos;s pre @-@ emptive .
pre @-@ emptive .
yeah , you know , in case you were having second thoughts
or regrets
or we &apos;re , like , ooged out--
ooged , huh ?
can i just get on with the speech part ?
yeah , go for it .
so i know that you don &apos;t think
that this is going to work out between us .
i just want to let you know that right here and right now ,
i &apos;m offering you an out .
like an escape clause .
why are you giving me an escape clause ?
i don &apos;t want to make assumptions
about what it is really doing here
got it .
so , if you would like to exercise it ,
just let me know .
i &apos;m good , but thanks .
ok .
good .
yeah .
so ...
see you for duke &apos;s tonight .
yeah .
yes ?
hi there .
i &apos;m looking for bonnie .
she &apos;s not here .
oh , do you know when she would
never .
you have quite an opinion for someone who doesn &apos;t know me .
you got some nerve knocking on a bennett witch &apos;s door
and asking her for anything .
what &apos;d i do ?
spirits talk , mr. salvatore ,
and so does my granddaughter .
you are no friend to us .
now get off my porch .
step outside and say that .
i am not bonnie .
you don &apos;t want to mess with me .
bonnie &apos;s not going to open the tomb .
oh , i think she will .
do you really want katherine out that bad ?
trust me .
no one i know wants to see that girl again .
except damon , the lovestruck idiot .
then what is it ?
or who is it ?
my mother &apos;s in there .
katherine couldn &apos;t help herself .
she just had tooy around with both of the salvatore brothers .
and when she got caught , so did my mother .
i watched jonathan gilbert take her away .
i &apos;m sorry .
you really mean that , don &apos;t you ?
yeah , i think we &apos;ll skip the dead mom
bonding so you can start serving a purpose .
which is what ?
leverage .
this belong to you ?
elena , are you ok ?
she &apos;s fine , for now .
tell me you have the grimoire and she &apos;ll stay fine .
i can get it .
which means your brother has it .
and i have the witch .
so one of you had better meet me
in the very public town square in 30 minutes
so we can safely discuss how fun
it &apos;s going to be to work together .
go ahead .
grovel again . oh , wait , no .
i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m leaving .
keep them buttoned down .
compulsion won &apos;t work .
just use violence
right . i got that .
sit . behave .
you &apos;re the key to this .
literally .
the one who opens the door .
tell me , how long have you been a witch ?
is there anything to drink here ?
are you offering ?
there &apos;s water on the nightstand .
hey. can i have a sip ?
come back in , shut the door !
don &apos;t hurt her !
don &apos;t make me !
lock it .
anna !
hey , what , uh ,
what happened to you last night ?
sorry , i had to leave .
i told your sister to tell you .
oh , i haven &apos;t seen her .
well , i gotta run , so--
hey , do you want to go to a party tonight ?
do i what ?
the guy that &apos;s throwing it is a total douche ,
but it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s supposed to be fun .
i figured , you know , safety in numbers .
so you &apos;re finally ready to go out with me , are you ?
it &apos;s been a while since i &apos;ve been to a party ,
and i kind want to get back out there .
and not be such a loner .
and , uh , i like you .
you &apos;re fun , and you &apos;re also kind of
strange and lurky , but , h , i guess i like that , too .
so , yeah , you should come to the party. with me .
it &apos;s in the woods by that old cemetery .
it &apos;s there , huh ?
that sounds cool .
uh , i &apos;ll meet you
oh--ok ! great !
cool .
got a hot date ,
or are you just planning on nabbing
the entire gilbert family ?
a party , right next to the old cemetery .
isn &apos;t that nice of them ?
lots of warm bloods for starving vampires .
i told you . i work alone .
yeah , so do i.
but you &apos;re minus a witch
and i &apos;m minus spell book .
so what do you say ?
stefan will come after you , you know that .
for messing with elena .
then he won &apos;t be too happy if i kill her
when i don &apos;t get what i want .
when do you want to do this ?
god , it &apos;s like 1864 all over again .
you salvatores are truly
pathetic when it comes to women .
tonight . after sundown .
meet at the church .
witches don &apos;t have eternal life , right ?
so you guys can die .
yeah , we can die .
that sucks .
stefan !
let &apos;s get outside .
when the sun goes down ,
leave town .
if i ever see you again ,
i will kill you .
how did you know where we we ?
many things can feel of a witch &apos;s power .
worry , anger .
after stefan told me that they had
taken you , i had a lot of both ?
simple locator spell was easy after that .
i &apos;m sorry .
about all of this .
not as sorry as they &apos;re gonna be .
so what do we do now ?
for now , you need to stay here .
a prisoner , in my own home ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i can &apos;t protect you if you leave the house .
we &apos;ll protect ourselves .
we need to let him have katherine back .
he &apos;s not going to stop until he gets her .
if we help him , maybe that ends it .
no ! he doesn &apos;t deserve to get what he wants .
what other choice do we have ?
witches being pulled down by vampire problems .
as much as we tried to do to stay out of it .
i &apos;ll open the tomb .
you get your brother &apos;girl ,
and destroy the rest with fire .
then this will be all over .
we still have to get damon to agree .
he already agreed once .
yeah , and then we double cross him .
so now he &apos;s angry .
he &apos;s hurt. there &apos;s a difference .
i think i know what i have to do .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
it was stefan .
there was nothing i could--
shut up ! stop talking .
without the witch ,
we don &apos;t have damon or the grimoire .
damon &apos;s not going to stop .
he &apos;ll find a way to get in .
and we &apos;re going to be there when he does .
i &apos;m going to have to change the locks .
did you stage a jailbreak ?
stefan .
oh , brother .
ever the white knight .
i convinced bonnie to help you .
i doubt that .
i &apos;m not going to say that i &apos;m sorry
we got the grimoire without you last night ,
because i &apos;m not , really .
well , at least you &apos;re honest .
i was protecting the people i love , damon .
but so were you ,
in your own , twisted way .
and as hard as it is to figure ,
we &apos;re all on the same side ,
after the same thing .
not interested .
yes , you are .
because you were willing to work with us yesterday .
fool me once , shame on you .
ok , when we were in atlanta ,
why didn &apos;t you use your compulsion on me ?
who &apos;s to say i didn &apos;t ?
you didn &apos;t .
i know you didn &apos;t .
but you could have .
you and i ...
we have something .
an understanding .
and i know that my betrayal hurt you ,
different from how it is with you and stefan ,
but i &apos;m promising you this now ,
i &apos;ll help you get katherine back .
i wish i could believe you .
ask me if i &apos;m lying now .
you know i won &apos;t stop , by the way ,
no matter what i do .
then we &apos;ll deal with it .
i didn &apos;t compel you in atlanta
because we were having fun .
i wanted it to be real .
i &apos;m trusting you .
don &apos;t make me regret it .
the duke party . i forgot .
i hope they stay clear of the church .
your hope , not mine .
elena , hey .
elena , oh , my god . where have you been ?
long story , no time to tell it .
wasn &apos;t talking to you .
sure you were .
we haven &apos;t met . i &apos;m matt .
matt , there &apos;s a reason we haven &apos;t met .
you and i are going that way .
ahhh . i &apos;m sorry , you guys .
cleared the debris away .
set the torches like you asked .
we can get down now .
what is that ?
it &apos;s everything i need to destroy them .
are you sure damon will come back with her ?
brother , witches .
everything ok ?
i just want to get this over with .
are we ready ?
i guess so .
done !
hey , uh , i &apos;ll be right back .
hey , man .
uh , you got any weed ?
wait , you &apos;re kidding me , right ?
you act like a total dick every time we cross paths ,
and now you want to party with me ?
i &apos;m not that wierd , i &apos;m just asking question .
dude , i don &apos;t get you , man .
it &apos;s a party .
you &apos;re a partier , ok ? there &apos;s no need to psycho @-@ analyze it .
i don &apos;t party any more .
and even if i did , it wouldn &apos;t be with you .
no problem .
carry on just standing there , by yourself .
all alone .
the enemy of fun .
do you even have any friends ?
thank god
weird hello , but ok .
what &apos;s the matter ?
uh , nothing , just ...
it &apos;s nothing .
come on , let walk .
air .
earth .
fire .
water .
that &apos;s it , just water from the tap ?
as opposed to what ?
i just figured mayb it would have to be blessed
or mystical or something .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s for katherine .
gotta have something to get her going .
unless your girl &apos;s offering a vein to tap .
admit it--
you can &apos;t wait to get rid of me .
i can &apos;t wait to get rid of you .
you ready ?
this place is wild .
you kinda like dead people , huh ?
i &apos;m strange , remember ?
you ok ?
this place makes me think about someone .
a dead someone ?
no , no , just ...
someone i used to know .
we made it all of what , 37 minutes in that party ?
not your scene ?
no , i &apos;m not really sure what my scene is anymore .
so what do you say ?
you want to be part of my non @-@ scene ?
i would happily be a part of your non @-@ scene ,
except , uh , i &apos;m leaving .
wait , what ?
yeah . my mom and i are moving away .
that &apos;s-- that &apos;s a bummer .
yeah ?
well , yeah .
so ...
guess this is good @-@ bye .
i guess it is .
anna , your face !
it &apos;s nothing .
it didn &apos;t look like nothing .
you didn &apos;t have to hit him that hard .
yes , i did .
grab him , and let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m taking him to meet my mother .
where &apos;s your date ?
who knows ?
ah , is the honeymoon over already ?
maybe .
after all that grief you gave me about liking her .
i figured it would have lasted longer than five minutes .
i just ... i don &apos;t know if i can do the whole public couple thing ,
she--she seems like she might be a little clingy .
well , good .
i need my boy single anyway .
incoming .
there you are .
here i am .
yeah , well , i &apos;m not drunk enough ,
so i &apos;m just going to go get another beer .
so ...
so .
i have another speech .
ok .
the hand thing with elena ,
it was lame .
well , i was lame .
and , hey , your feelings for elena aside ,
damon was there ,
and he was always such a jerk to me .
and ...
i wanted to show off that i was with the good guy .
so , anyway , i was lame .
so ...
forgiven ?
yeah , course .
yeah .
what do they say ? sounds like latin
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s latin .
what &apos;s happening ?
it worked !
of course it worked .
weave some fires to build .
i &apos;m gonna go get the gasoline , i &apos;ll be right back .
you ready ?
what ?
you think i &apos;m going to go in there by myself
so you can seal me in ?
don &apos;t take her in .
i &apos;ll bring the walls down .
you &apos;ll bring walls down if i don &apos;t .
you think i trust you ?
as much as i trust you .
enough !
both of u .
look , he needs leverage .
he needs to know that you &apos;re not going
to shut the door when he gets inside .
i get it .
i &apos;ll go .
may i ?
dark down there ?
i thought i told you to leave .
i considered it .
then i thought , screw you .
hey , hero .
i &apos;m going down there to get my mother .
can &apos;t let you do that .
well , ben &apos;s about to make a main course
out of elena &apos;s little brother
so you can stop me or him .
your choice .
what is that ?
they can sense you .
now , where is she ? !
damon !
hey , you &apos;re not going in there .
you think you can stop me ?
bonnie ...
why did you let her go in ?
because she isn &apos;t coming out , baby .
none of them are .
do you think she cares about you ?
you &apos;re disposable .
i don &apos;t care. she already gave me what i want .
you &apos;re going to say &quot; eternal life &quot; ?
you &apos;re really that stupid ?
you know , i &apos;ve heard about you .
you don &apos;t feed .
you &apos;re not strong enough to beat me .
is that all you got ?
no .
i got this .
damon ?
damon !
where &apos;s elena ?
damon took her inside .
what ?
stefan !
if you go in there , you won &apos;t come out .
what did you do ?
opening the door didn &apos;t remove the seal ,
it just opened the door .
what &apos;s the seal ?
some seals keep vampires from entering .
this one keeps them from ...
coming out .
elena &apos;s human .
she can leave .
anna and katherine can &apos;t .
damon can &apos;t .
you weren &apos;t even planning on breaking the spell , were you ?
i told you .
i ll protect my own .
elena can get out . that &apos;s all that matters .
you must have a taste for it .
you scream and shriek and even bother to escape ,
but then you just come right back to it .
god !
mother !
your boyfriend did this , you know .
his father did .
and jonathan gilbert .
made a choice a long time ago
that it would be gilbert blood
that brought her back to life .
i had jeremy all ready to go , but ...
stefan !
you can &apos;t just leave him in there , grams !
he made his choice !
no . no .
here .
just tell me what to do . i &apos;ll do it !
we are not strong enough .
even if we were able to bring the seal down ,
there &apos;s no guarantee that we could get it back up again .
you said it yourself--
many things can fuel a witch &apos;s power .
help me !
or i &apos;ll do it alone .
please don &apos;t !
let her go !
no !
go , go . i &apos;ll be right behind you .
anna !
where am i ?
elena , stefan ...
he &apos;s right behind me .
stefan , what are you doing ?
it &apos;s gonna be ok . we &apos;ll fix it .
what is it ?
i can &apos;t .
can &apos;t ? can &apos;t what ?
the spell &apos;s still up , we can &apos;t get them out .
yet .
you went in there not knowing if you could come back out ?
oh , my god .
i heard you scream .
we can &apos;t leave him in there .
we promised him , both of us .
i know .
even if we &apos;re able to break through the seal ,
we won &apos;t be able to hold it for long .
she &apos;s not here !
damon .
she &apos;s not here .
what ?
she &apos;s not here !
i think it &apos;s working !
i just wanted my mother back .
jeremy &apos;s fine . he &apos;s outside .
we won &apos;t touch him .
bonnie ! keep going !
they better hury .
stefan , they can &apos;t hold it much longer !
damon , we need to get out of here .
it doesn &apos;t make sense . they locked her inside .
if we don &apos;t leave now ,
we &apos;re not getting out .
how could she not be in here ?
it &apos;s not worth spending all of eternity down here !
she &apos;s not worth it ! no !
damon !
please .
oh , my god !
i can &apos;t !
yes , you can !
is this for real ?
is what for real ?
you being all cool and honest and open ?
speech number three ?
i want this to work .
and i &apos;m scared that you &apos;re going to change your mind
and you &apos;re not going to want it .
i don &apos;t want to mesit up .
i don &apos;t want to mess it up , either .
he &apos;s ok .
he &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , let me help you .
oh , i &apos;m fine .
you don &apos;t need to coddle me , baby .
it was a big spell , grs .
i could tell it took a lot out of you .
i &apos;ll be fine .
how &apos;s your head ?
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s all right .
i just--i wish i knew how i pass out .
i didn &apos;t drink that much , i swear
and you don &apos;t remember anything ?
the whole thing &apos;s pretty cloudy . i just ...
i know how this looks .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
no , jermy , don &apos;t be sorry .
you didn &apos;t do anything , ok ?
ok .
i &apos;ve gotta head over to bonnie &apos;s for a little bit ,
but is there anything that you need ?
oh , no , i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m gonna crash .
ok. well , jenna &apos;s here , and i &apos;ll be back soon .
you knew katherine wasn &apos;t in there .
you wouldn &apos;t have helped me .
no !
why do you get happiness ?
damon , please , you wouldn &apos;t have helped me !
you know you wouldn &apos;t !
why do you get it and i don &apos;t ? !
the guard , the one of the church ,
the one who lock us in !
she promised to turn him
he was obsessed with her .
she had him under her spell , like everybody else !
he let her go .
the last i saw her
was chicago .
1983 .
she knew where you were , damon .
she didn &apos;t care .
sorry .
i just got the bonnie &apos;s .
everything all right ?
yeah .
how &apos;s damon ? is he going to be ok ?
i don &apos;t know .
can i call you later ?
yeah , of course .
grams ?
grams , wake up !
grams !
grams ? !
elena !
help !
wake up !
she &apos;s not breathing ! she &apos;s not breathing !
please , wake up !
i &apos;m gonna fix it !
yes , i need an ambulance .
it &apos;s ok , i can fix this .
it &apos;s an emergency .
no , no ! i can fix this !
grams , i can fix this ! bonnie !
bonnie !
