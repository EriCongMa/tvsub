the rainbows are holding on to one point lead .
but the rio rancho is making a run .

aw , thanks , coach .
okay , girls , enough already .
how &apos;s it ?

that hot babe over there--
checking you out .
you looked .
i said don &apos;t look .
it &apos;s okay , brah , she &apos;s my date .
can i get a couple spicy plates
and , uh , two coconut waters , please .
i hope you didn &apos;t find her online .
lots of crazy ladies online .
scary kind crazy .
not fun crazy .
yeah , but we &apos;ve known each other for a long time .
almost got married once .
that &apos;s a different kind of crazy .
but i know how it is .
trust me , brah-- love is sweeter , the second time around .
well , i keep that in mind .
mahalo , brother .
mahalo .
i &apos;m really glad you wanted to do this .
me , too .
you look great .
thank you . so do you .
you know , i had a really good time the other night .
me , too .
i &apos;ve forgotten what a rush it is
to ride down kalakaua on a motorcycle .
so ... do you want to talk about what &apos;s bothering you ?
it &apos;s been a while , but i can always tell .
it &apos;s kono .
captain fryer &apos;s turned her into the poster girl
for his war on police corruption .
how &apos;s she taking it ?
not well .
she &apos;s hanging out with some bitter ex @-@ cops ,
making bad choices .
have you talked to her ?
that &apos;s the thing . i &apos;ve tried .
she doesn &apos;t want to talk to me .
what about mcgarrett ?
have you talked to him about it ?
no , not yet .
not until i know for sure what &apos;s going on with her .
lieutenant kelly .
i &apos;ll be right there .
go .
i &apos;ll take a rain check .
vic &apos;s name is brian scartelli .
he &apos;s the head coach of the women &apos;s volleyball team .
looks like our guy was coming out of the shower
when he was attacked ; killer slit his throat .
cell phone and wallet are missing .
otherwise , nothing else appears to have been disturbed .
so , what , robbery gone bad ?
no , more than that .
check out the , uh , bruising here along the ribs .
all right , this is a serious beating this guy got .
he must have pissed somebody off .
either that or somebody wanted information out of this guy .
hpd hasn &apos;t turned up any witnesses .
last people to see him alive were his players .
bunch of them came down
after the game and gave him a gatorade bath .
explains the shower .
everybody says his team loved him .
same with the fans , athletic department and even the media .
yeah , alums liked him , too .
he was living in a guesthouse on the property of a rich couple .
karl and trisha joyner .
live out in kahala .
yeah , well , somebody had beef with this guy .
game was televised .
maybe the cameras caught something .
all right , you and chin go through the footage .
danny and i-- we &apos;re gonna go to kahala , see what turns up .
let me ask you a question .
what do you think , uh , one of these places costs ? that place ?
right there , what &apos;s that cost ?
hell of a lot more than you and i earn , bruh .
mm @-@ hmm . hell of a lot more
than a college volleyball coach earns , too , right ?
yet , this guy scartelli is living it up .
some guys have all the luck , i guess .
oh , yeah , danny , lucky .
i mean , he &apos;s dead , okay ? but he &apos;s a lucky guy
&apos;cause look at the house he &apos;s living in .
this is my point , okay ?
what are the perks of being a cop ?
well ...
pay sucks ,
the hours suck ,
sometimes , i get-- no , no , not sometimes-- all the time ,
i get shot at all the time .
what are you talking about ?
you never-- you hardly ever get shot at .
is that a joke ? you making a joke ?
okay , when was the last time you got clipped ?
you &apos;re not a funny person .
are you trying to be funny ? you &apos;re not .
okay , here &apos;s my point .
all right , living practically rent @-@ free
in some rich guy &apos;s guesthouse
seems to me like a nice perk , okay ,
for keeping the world a safer place .
you homeless now ?
why don &apos;t you try decorating , danny .
like , get some doilies for the tables ,
some flowers for the front room .
you scoff , okay , but that homeless scenario
is not very far off for me .
you know i &apos;m getting kicked out of my apartment ?
what are you talking about ?
knocking down my building , turning it into luxury condos ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s what this island needs , more condos .
i don &apos;t understand . everybody loves brian .
who would do this ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out right now , sir .
um , it would be very helpful to us
if we could see where he was staying .
sure , yeah . this way .
anything , uh , out of the ordinary with the coach recently ?
i don &apos;t think so .
everything was good .
team was on track to go all the way this season .
as long as his girls are happy , brian &apos;s happy .
his girls ? you talking about the players ?
that &apos;s what brian calls them .
called them .
he was like a second father to his players .
this place is completely ridiculous , okay ?
they got a steam--
you see the steam shower in there ?
their bathroom is bigger
than my entire apartment , okay ?
yeah .
and they have a lap pool specifically for the guesthouse .
the guesthouse has their own pool .
lap pool ?
yeah .
their own pool .
i have some photographs .
so scartelli took photos of his girlfriend .
he isn &apos;t the first guy to do that .
okay .
she &apos;s , uh , she &apos;s young .
yeah , she &apos;s young .
she &apos;s also one of scartelli &apos;s players .
all right , upload these to our sky drive .
see if chin and lori can lock on who this girl is .
i do not think that these were taken by a second father .
yeah , well , maybe her real father
or her boyfriend found out
what was going on off the court between these two .
yeah , that &apos;s a good point .
&apos;cause if i found out somebody taking pictures of grace
like this , i &apos;d go to their house and i &apos;d kill them .
yeah , me , too .
you get a name ?
got more than that .
we ran the photos that you put up on sky drive .
girl in the pics is melanie ayers .
we &apos;re looking at her i.d. right now .
she &apos;s the team &apos;s star player ,
and according to the video footage
that chin and i went through ,
she &apos;s the only team member that wasn &apos;t
at the game last night .
okay , why ? is she injured ?
no , she was supposed to play .
according to the coach &apos;s phone records ,
he was talking to melanie six or seven times a day
for the last couple of weeks .
he have that kind of contact with any of his other players ?
no , just her .
and in an interview she gave to the college paper ,
melanie referenced a serious relationship with someone ,
but denied it was with another uh student .
i &apos;m betting she didn &apos;t say anything
about the coach being like a second father , either .
last but not least ,
we pulled scartelli &apos;s financials .
he was renting a motel room out in aiea .
he prepaid for an entire week .
doesn &apos;t make sense .
guy &apos;s got a luxury pad here in kahala .
no . crappy motel room all the way up in aiea
would make sense if scartelli had something to hide .
all right , you know what , i think it &apos;s time
to see what melanie ayers has to say about this .
danny and i are gonna go and talk to her .
chin , you and lori head out to aiea ,
check out that motel , all right ?
okay , good .
wait ... wait a minute .
you think i was having an affair with coach scartelli ?
no .
you think he took these pictures ?
he didn &apos;t take those pictures ?
no .
no . no . god , no .
okay . who did ?
v @-@ cross .
v @-@ cross-- that &apos;s a sneaker company .
yeah . they sponsor the team .
i was going to do an ad campaign for them .
so we did a photo shoot , and some of the pictures
came out a little ...
you know .
wait a minute . an ad campaign-- isn &apos;t that
against regulations for college players ?
yeah .
but they offered me 150 grand .
i mean , that &apos;s a lot of money .
when coach found out about it , he benched me .
okay , so that &apos;s why
you weren &apos;t at the game the other night ?
yeah . yeah , i mean , he was going to ask
for a ruling before i could play again .
look , i made a stupid mistake .
all right ? coach was helping me fix it . that &apos;s all .
all right .
it &apos;s not a good time for me , malia .
that &apos;s what i hear .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
can i come in ?
kono , i know things have been weird
between us since chin and i broke up ,
and i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry about that ,
but this is important .
chin is worried about you .
wait . so , what , are ... are you and chin back together ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
wow . how &apos;d you manage that ?
do you remember when you were in high school
and chin and i used to drive you
all around the island to those surf competitions ?
the nssa &apos;s .
chin was so proud of you .
i mean , that &apos;s how i knew he was serious about me--
because he wanted to share
how proud he was of you .
i don &apos;t expect you to understand , kono ,
but chin and me-- we have something special .
yeah .
where was that something special when he lost his badge ?
kono .
right now ?
okay .
look , as much as i would love
to continue this conversation , i can &apos;t .
i got to run .
kono .
and the next time you &apos;re looking to score points with chin ,
leave me out of it .
i &apos;ve seen the man ,
but that &apos;s not the woman he was with .
you &apos;re sure ?
positive .
nice lady .
you get a name ?
no , but you could ask her yourself .
she hasn &apos;t checked out .
she &apos;s in room 104 .
thank you .
looks like our mystery lady &apos;s coming back .
hold on .
i got a print .
let &apos;s see if fong gets a hit .
there &apos;s a message here , too .
trisha , it &apos;s brian .
i want you to stay put .
he knows you left , and he &apos;s flipping out .
give me a little time to talk him down .
i &apos;ll check with you as soon as i can .
that &apos;s the coach .
okay , fong got a hit .
print belongs to a former schoolteacher , trisha joyner .
he sent her dmv photo .
trisha joyner-- that &apos;s karl joyner &apos;s wife .
scartelli was staying at their guesthouse .
chin .
scartelli rented a motel room for trisha joyner .
sounds like she &apos;s leaving her husband .
oh , that &apos;s got to hurt .
open your guesthouse up to a guy ,
he eats your food , drinks your beer
and helps himself to your wife .
well , according to the message we heard , karl joyner
wasn &apos;t taking it too well .
all right , you guys , you wait at the hotel
for trish to come back .
danny and i are going to go find karl joyner .
look at this.he &apos;s moving .
he &apos;s got a gun . gun .
karl joyner , let me see your hands right now . right now !
don &apos;t shoot me . please .
you don &apos;t understand . i need to find my wife .
they &apos;re after her !
danny !
all right .
i got boot prints and burn marks over here .
i &apos;m thinking single sniper , bipod .
rifle had to have been a semiautomatic
to deliver two shots the way it did .
plus he had to get through some pretty heavy tree cover .
he had to be about 600 feet from where joyner was standing .
at least . plus there &apos;s wind .
whoever killed joyner was a pro .
this is starting to look a lot less like a love triangle gone bad .
wait a minute . right before he went down ,
joyner said that somebody was after his wife .
who &apos;d be after his wife ?
i don &apos;t know , but where the hell is his wife ?
we need to find out what joyner was into .
okay , so this guy was definitely dirty .
on paper , karl joyner owned a bunch
of dry cleaning stores throughout honolulu .
perfectly respectable way to maintain
his champagne and caviar lifestyle .
let me guess-- they &apos;re all fronts .
yes . uh , all the payroll employees were bogus names
and social security numbers , except for joyner himself .
all right , so the stores--
they brought in a decent amount of dough ,
but nothing compared to the actual revenue
that was on the books .
this guy was definitely in the cleaning business ,
but he wasn &apos;t cleaning clothes ; he was laundering money .
right . okay . so what happened ? what went wrong ?
uh , the bank account zeroed out a few days ago .
maybe he got greedy .
we got any leads on who he was working for ?
not yet , but whoever it is ,
i think that they want their money back .
yeah , they do .
they just killed karl joyner .
now they think his wife has it .
we got to find her .
trisha &apos;s got to be back soon , right ?
well , she left all her clothes .
she didn &apos;t check out .
she &apos;ll be back .
right .
want this ?
no , thanks .
what , you don &apos;t want to know
what men really think about foreplay
or how to wax like a pro ?
not so much .
fair enough .
sorry . uh , patience isn &apos;t my strong suit .
you &apos;re a lot like steve , you know that ?
am i ?
what &apos;s his deal anyway ?
what do you mean , what &apos;s his deal ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , he &apos;s kind of hard to get a read on , except for the ,
you know , the daddy issues .
those are right out there front and center .
and not like i &apos;m trying to
shrink him or anything ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m not-- i &apos;m totally not--
but , uh ...
i don &apos;t know .
just sort of like to , you know ,
get to know my new boss a little better ... is all .
okay . sorry .
is this awkward ?
okay , it &apos;s awkward .
let &apos;s just ...
rewind .
delete . i never said anything .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
you got it .
okay , great .
someone &apos;s here .
gun !
go !
hold your fire !
why ?
the driver
it &apos;s my cousin .
want to tell me what &apos;s going on ?
i didn &apos;t know it was this bad .
why don &apos;t we start with what you did know ?
i knew what we all knew .
kono lost her badge .
she &apos;s been in a bad place .
steve , she hacked into the hpd database using my password .
when i asked her about it ,
she said she wanted to see her case file .
what &apos;s her connection to joyner
and his money laundering business ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve never seen her
with the thug she was with today .
she &apos;s hanging with guys like ray mapes now .
who is ray mapes , chin ?
ray mapes is an ex @-@ cop .
he lost his badge when he got caught shaking down drug dealers .
i figured that she was feeling like
that &apos;s all she was good enough for .
i know that feeling .
how did it get this far , huh ?
why didn &apos;t she come to us ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know what she &apos;s into .
i don &apos;t know how deep she &apos;s in .
and i don &apos;t know if we can protect her anymore .
do you understand that ?
i know .
i should have told you .
i should &apos;ve .
i &apos;m sorry .
did kono see you today ?
i don &apos;t think so .
get a lock on kono &apos;s cell . we &apos;re bringing her in .
hold on .
you &apos;re going to be okay .
hold on , dwight .
dwight ?
dwight ?
hello ?
where &apos;s dwight ?
frank ?
he can &apos;t talk right now .
you get her ?
what the hell is going on here ?
did you get her ?
get who ?
trisha joyner .
the bitch who &apos;s got my money .
i have no idea about that .
all i know is that dwight called
and told me i was gonna take him to a motel in aiea ,
but then when we got there , hpd was on the scene
and they opened fire . dwight &apos;s been hit .
is he alive ?
i don &apos;t think so .
don &apos;t think . make sure .
he &apos;s dead .
go dump him off of the pau lane bridge
then get right back into town .
what ?
you wanted in . you &apos;re in .
get out of the car , kono !
keep your hands where i can see &apos; em .
lori .
i want to help you , kono , okay ?
i really want to help you , you gotta help me .
you gotta tell me what &apos;s going on .
i can &apos;t .
you can &apos;t ! listen to me !
that &apos;s not good enough ! &quot; i can &apos;t &quot; is not good enough
because today , you &apos;re driving in a getaway car with a dead person
in the front seat , okay , kono ?
this isn &apos;t a game ! we &apos;re talking about two murders !
i mean , what are you thinking , kono , huh ? !
what happen to you ?
steve !
what ? !
not like this .
let me talk to her .
whatever you &apos;re into , i &apos;m here .
we &apos;re family , right ?
nothing &apos;s ever gonna change that .
listen to me , you &apos;re not alone .
not today , not tomorrow , not any of the days ahead .
you &apos;re not alone &apos; cause i &apos;m right here .
but you need to come clean , kono .
you need to talk to me , hmm ?
all you have to do is talk to me .
please .
i can &apos;t .
hey , captain fryer , what the hell are you doing here ?
you &apos;re done here , mcgarrett .
kono , get up .
hey , hey ! she &apos;s in custody .
oh , no , she &apos;s mine .
what are you talking about , she &apos;s yours ?
this has nothing to do with ia .
wrong again . she &apos;s working for me .
you think you can just come in here and mess with my team like this ?
don &apos;t flatter yourself mcgarrett . this has nothing to do with you .
you &apos;re interfering in a murder investigation !
my investigation includes your murder investigation , okay ?
what are you talking about ?
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t bring this to me .
it went too far !
fryer said he &apos;d go after the rest of five @-@ 0
with ia investigations if i didn &apos;t cooperate .
and you thought you had to protect us ?
yeah !
well , protecting us wasn &apos;t your call .
it &apos;s my badge !
we should &apos;ve had a voice in it .
great . just like you gave uncle a voice in it
when you decided to take the fall for the money
he stole from the forfeiture locker .
must run in the family .
ia &apos;s been running an undercover operation on
a ring of dirty ex @-@ cops .
they shake drug dealers , arms dealers ,
human traffickers all over the island .
they &apos;ve dropped dozens of bodies ,
including brian scartelli &apos;s ,
your dead volleyball coach .
and karl joyner , huh ?
that &apos;s who he was laundering money for .
why would you not loop us in on it ?
i couldn &apos;t risk it . you understand that .
these guys still have contacts inside hpd .
i &apos;ve been circling delano &apos;s organization for three years .
now , kono was just making inroads .
she &apos;s as close as we ever gotten .
we had something on this guy dwight murphy .
could &apos;ve maybe leveraged that to get him to flip on delano ,
but thanks to you guys ,
dwight murphy &apos;s in the morgue courtesy of a five @-@ 0 bullet .
they &apos;re looking for a woman named trisha joyner .
yeah , i know . we &apos;re looking for her , too .
well , delano says that she has his money .
if he gets to her first , she &apos;s dead .
i have to go back .
no ! you &apos;re already in too deep and it &apos;s too dangerous !
it &apos;s the only way to get to trisha .
look , i don &apos;t like what he did .
but i understand why fryer targeted me .
you don &apos;t understand !
do you know who frank delano &apos;s partner was
when he was on the job ?
do you know ? !
it was fryer !
delano almost took fryer down with him
when he lost his badge .
don &apos;t you get it ?
fryer &apos;s using you !
he &apos;s using you to get revenge .
that &apos;s true ? delano was your partner ?
you &apos;re going after your ex @-@ partner ?
my history with delano has nothing to do with this .
this isn &apos;t about going after bad guys , okay ?
it &apos;s about you getting even , right ? huh ?
you put kono &apos;s life in danger to settle a personal score .
not just kono &apos;s life , the life of
an innocent civilian who &apos;s still out there .
and that &apos;s exactly why kono has to go back in .
without her , we &apos;ve got nothing on delano
and no way to find trisha joyner .
there &apos;s gotta be another way .
it doesn &apos;t have to be kono .
yes , it does .
why does it have to be kono ?
it does because the only reason that delano let kono
near his organization is because she came out of five @-@ 0 .
now everybody on this island knows , mcgarrett ,
you play it fast and loose .
she was an easy sell that she was dirty .
you looking to blame someone for
why kono &apos;s in danger just look in the mirror .
what &apos;d you do , fryer , huh ? what &apos;d you do to coerce
kono to come and work for you ?
did you tell her you &apos;d come after me ?
come after chin ho ? what &apos;d you do ?
when did you stop believing the ends justify the means ?
i use what i have just like you .
i &apos;m a cop , she &apos;s a cop !
she &apos;s a year
and a half out of the academy , you got her driving
around town with a dead killer in the car !
we opened fire on her today .
could &apos;ve killed her .
i would never do that .
you underestimate yourself and kono .
it &apos;s delano .
don &apos;t answer it .
answer it !
listen to me . you don &apos;t have to do this anymore , kono .
if she doesn &apos;t answer it
my entire investigation is blown . three years .
i have to .
trisha joyner &apos;s life depends on it .
if she goes in , five @-@ 0 goes in to back her up .
done . answer the phone .
frank .
yeah , i took care of it .
i &apos;m on my way back .
fryer , i want to be able to track her real time , huh ?
delano &apos;s an ex @-@ cop , he &apos;ll spot a tail
a mile off . and no wire .
first thing he &apos;ll do is i pat me down
when i get back . he doesn &apos;t trust me .
kono &apos;s right . the only reason
he &apos;s pulling her onto his crew now is he &apos;s down a man .
i &apos;ll get you a message as soon as i can .
it &apos;s not gonna be that easy , okay ?
delano &apos;s not gonna leave you alone .
i &apos;ll figure it out .
all right , we &apos;re gonna be in a van ,
ready to move on your word .
all right . i couldn &apos;t ask for better back @-@ up .
where have you been ?
seriously ?
what he means is what took you so long ?
i &apos;ve been cleaning up your mess , that &apos;s where i &apos;ve been .
which one of you two wanted dwight dead ?
what the hell ?
dwight and me walked into an ambush at that motel .
somebody tipped off hpd .
i want to know which one of you did it .
well , seems like you got away without a scratch , huh ?
how do we know it wasn &apos;t you who dropped dwight .
i just dumped his body off a bridge
&apos;cause somebody screwed up !
now is not the time to mess with me !
you ran into some bad luck , that &apos;s all .
too bad about dwight ,
but there &apos;s nothing we can do about it now .
you need to stay focused on what matters most , right ?
finding trisha joyner .
she &apos;s the one who has your money ?
we have an unfortunate situation here .
it seems mrs. joyner emptied
her husband &apos;s bank account before she ran out on him .
minor detail : the money not his , it &apos;s ours .
all right , so trisha joyner &apos;s in the wind .
how do we find her ?
we don &apos;t . she &apos;s gonna come to us .
turns out she confided in the volleyball coach .
he helped her leave her husband .
she &apos;s on the run , but she trusts him .
minor detail : the volleyball coach is dead .
his cell phone isn &apos;t .
dwight grabbed it the night he took care of the guy .
i sent mrs. joyner a text from this cell phone .
telling her her husband knows where he is .
i booked her a room in the aston waikiki .
mrs. joyner &apos;s gonna text us when she checks in .
what if she knows he &apos;s already dead ?
she &apos;s on the run .
she &apos;s not buying newspapers and watching the news .
as long as we move fast , we &apos;ll be fine .
how do you like that .
she &apos;s there .
room 2127 .
... the chain of craters
a lot of the smoke is not related to the volcano .
thanks keahi . well , police tonight still searching
for a suspect in the brutal murder of brian scartelli .
... a coach of university whose body was found just earlier this morning .
mrs. joyner , nice to finally meet you .
kono &apos;s been out for almost two hours .
i don &apos;t like it .
she &apos;ll make the call .
should have tailed her .
what are we doing ?
trying to activate the microphone on kono &apos;s cell phone .
if i can get it , it will work like a wire .
can you do that ?
we &apos;ll see .
if i can remotely download this spyware onto her phone &apos;s o.s. ,
i might be able to access it and pick up an audio signal .
this better be worth it , you understand ?
it will be .
look , right now , the money &apos;s the only thing
that ties delano to the murders .
we catch him with the money , he goes away for life .
i &apos;m getting an audio .
it &apos;s staticky , but i &apos;m getting something .
let me see if i can clear it up .
you have something that belongs to me .
no . no , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
your husband was holding some money in his bank account for me .
i believe you took it .
oh god .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t know . i ...
you killed brian .
where &apos;s karl ?
oh god .
i &apos;m getting a clear signal .
they &apos;re on the move .
they &apos;ve got trisha joyner .
bank of o &apos;ahu about five blocks down .
they &apos;re heading to a bank of o &apos;ahu .
but which branch ?
we can &apos;t go in guns blazing .
we don &apos;t want to provoke a hostage situation .
