did you know that during pregnancy ..
your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back ?
oh , my god ! let me see that .
you fall for it every time .
hey ! i brought you my old maternity clothes .
oh , pheebs , that &apos;s so sweet . oh , those are so cute !
look . see how they expand as the baby grows ?
and after the baby &apos;s born they &apos;re great for shoplifting melons .
good , you &apos;re all here . thanksgiving , 4 : 00 .
guess who i invited ? remember will culvert from high school ?
no .
he was in ross &apos; class .
marching band , was kind of overweight . really overweight .
i was his thin friend .
i don &apos;t remember . are you talking about your imaginary boyfriend ?
no , that was jared .
wow . haven &apos;t thought about him in a long time .
will &apos;s here on business , and he didn &apos;t have a place to go , so i invited him here .
that &apos;s nice .
oh , he &apos;s lost a bunch of weight .
he looks good . okay , i mean really gorgeous .
i still love chandler .
wouldn &apos;t hurt you to say it once in a while .
just so you know , i &apos;m not gonna make a turkey this year ..
what ?
phoebe doesn &apos;t eat turkey .
phoebe !
turkeys are beautiful , intelligent animals .
no , they &apos;re not ! they &apos;re ugly and stupid and delicious !
plus , eating them is like a tradition .
it goes back to the first thanksgiving when the lndians sat down with the cowboys .
oh , right . that &apos;s when they had that big rodeo at plymouth rock .
it &apos;s not just phoebe . will &apos;s still on a diet , chandler doesn &apos;t eat thanksgiving food ..
rachel &apos;s having her aversion to poultry .
she is ?
yeah . remember ? i had to leave the other day when you had that chicken .
i thought that was because i put the whole thing ..
on my hand and made it walk across the table .
it &apos;s not worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people . it &apos;s a lot of work .
but you gotta have turkey on thanksgiving !
thanksgiving with no turkey is like fourth of july with no apple pie .
or friday with no two pizzas .
fine , if it means that much to you . but there &apos;s gonna be a ton left over .
no . i promise i will finish that turkey .
you &apos;re telling me you can eat almost an entire turkey in one sitting ?
that &apos;s right . because i &apos;m a tribbiani ! this is what we do .
we may not be great thinkers or world leaders ..
we don &apos;t read a lot or run fast , but damn it , we can eat !
the.one.with.the.rumour

it &apos;s no good . throw it out .
meet some people .
this is my husband , chandler . this is will .
oh , hey . i &apos;d shake your hand but i &apos;m really into the game .

hi .
hey . wow !
well done .
wanna give me a hand ?
i can &apos;t get over how great you look .
you look incredible too . you &apos;re so fit .

is there a problem ?
no . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s just .. god , i hated her .

she was horrible to me in high school .
but hey , that was a long time ago . i &apos;m in a good place . might be fun to see her again .

no , will ! no !
it &apos;s been a while since we screamed . maybe we should .
oh , okay . no !
come on !
damn you , ref ! you burn in hell !
what are you doing ? you &apos;ve got an entire turkey to eat .
let me explain to you how the human body works .
i have to warm up my stomach first .
eating chips is like stretching .
okay .
don &apos;t worry , tribbianis never get full .
i &apos;m here to tell you something .
you can eat and eat , but nothing will ever fill that void .

ross !
hey , you came ! man , you look incredible ! hot stuff !

i &apos;m a commodities broker .
that sounds interesting .
yeah , it &apos;s not .
oh .
but i &apos;m rich and thin .
oh .
i haven &apos;t seen you since lance davis &apos; graduation party .
that was such a fun night .
would &apos;ve been good if we had gotten in , but still fun .
we were lame . do you remember how into dinosaurs we were ?
yeah .
so , what do you do now ?
so how long are you in town ?
hi .
hey , sweetie . oh , good .
rachel greene .
oh , that &apos;s right . are you gonna be okay ?
oh , i &apos;ll be fine . it &apos;s just .. god , i hate her , ross ! i hate her !
high school was a long time ago .
look at her standing there with those yams .
my two greatest enemies : rachel greene and complex carbohydrates .
oh , my god . who is that ?
that &apos;s will , from high school .
oh ! i do not remember him .
wow , really got that sexy smoldering thing going on .
oh , my god . look at the way he &apos;s just staring at me .
he &apos;s trying to mouth something to me .
i hate you !
okay , dinner &apos;s ready !
okay !
solid effort . solid effort .
oh , so who won ?
green bay .
detroit .
what ?
the lions technically won .
but it was a moral victory for the green bay mermen .
hi ! will , right ? right , hi . i &apos;m rachel greene .
oh , i remember you .
really ? aren &apos;t you sweet ?
i gotta tell you , i &apos;m having the hardest time placing you .
hang on ! i think i remember you .
did we fool around at lance davis &apos; graduation party ?
you are unbelievable .
thank you .
rachel ? why don &apos;t you sit here ? and will , you sit way over there .
that &apos;s it ? even if nobody helps me , i can eat that . no problem .
at least give me a challenge .
this is chandler &apos;s chicken .
this is the turkey .
oh . how big is that ?
about 19 pounds .
it &apos;s like me when i was born .
who would like some yams ? will ?
you &apos;d like that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
what ? oh , can we please keep the chicken ..
and the turkey on the other side ?
the smell is just ..
typical .
what ?
i said it was typical .
typical of you . queen rachel does whatever she wants in rachel @-@ land .
seriously , who is this guy ?
sorry , do you have a problem with me ?
i don &apos;t know . do i ? do i ?
i think you do .
you were a little mean to him in high school .
a little mean ? you made my life miserable .
i had no idea . i &apos;m sorry .
well , you should be . screw it . bring on the yams .
but you worked so hard .
yams !
okay .
i &apos;m real sorry for whatever i did to you in high school .
it wasn &apos;t just me . we had a club .
you had a club ?
the &quot; i hate rachel greene club &quot; !
so you all just joined together to hate me ?
who else was in this club ?
me and ross .
no need to point . she knows who ross is .
you were in an &quot; i hate rachel &quot; club ?
yes , he was .
no , no .
so who else was in this club ?
that exchange student from thailand .
but i don &apos;t think he knew what it was .
you guys were cool .
so , ross , we went out for two years ..
and you never told me you were in an &quot; i hate rachel club &quot; ?
you went out with her ? we had a pact .
it &apos;s not like it was binding forever .
it had the word &quot; eternity &quot; in it .
i &apos;m thinking of joining an &quot; i hate turkey club . &quot;
although , i do love a turkey club .
monica ? did you know about this ?
i didn &apos;t . is that why you used to lock the bedroom door ?
yeah .
a little relieved , i gotta say .
look , rach , i &apos;m sorry , okay ? i was a stupid kid , okay ?
the only reason i joined ..
cofounded .
cofounded .
cofounded the club , was that i was in love with you .
i didn &apos;t handle it very well . if you think about it , the &quot; i hate rachel club .. &quot;
was really the &quot; i love rachel club . &quot;
except that it was really the &quot; i hate rachel club . &quot;
so you &apos;d get together and say mean things about me ?
we did a little more than that .
no , no , no .
what else did you do ?
we started a rumor .
what rumor ?
come on , will , just take off your shirt and tell us .
ross ?
it was no big deal .
we said that .. the rumor was that ..
you had both male and female reproductive parts .
what ?
that &apos;s right . we said your parents ..
flipped a coin , decided to raise you as a girl , but you still had a hint of a penis .
oh , my god !
you started that ?
you heard that ?
everyone at our school heard it !
everyone at my school heard it . you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader ?
oh , no !
it makes sense now . this is why adam carter wouldn &apos;t go out with me .
why billy would just stay in this region .
billy &apos;s gay now , so that one &apos;s not really our fault .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i thought it might be true .
i was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me .
stop staring ! there &apos;s nothing there ! it &apos;s not true !
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m gonna need proof .
come on , whip it out .
you are my everest .
you don &apos;t have to finish .
i do . otherwise , what &apos;s next ?
today i can &apos;t finish a turkey , but tomorrow i eat half a powerbar ..
wrap it up and put it in the fridge ? no !
i gotta change my pants . what was i thinking ? jeans have no give .
guys , help me with the dishes . there &apos;s a lot of pots and pans .
honey , i &apos;d love to , but the second game is about to start .
oh , yeah , the second game . more football for the pheebster .
who &apos;s playing ?
los angeles .
last time i checked , los angeles didn &apos;t have a football team .
did i say los angeles ? i meant the team that used to be in los angeles ..
and is now in st. louis . i actually knew that .
okay , quick , name three players on that team .
gretzky ..
agassi ..
i &apos;m a pretty little girl .
listen to what sean mcmahon wrote in my yearbook senior year .
&quot; dear rach , you &apos;re such a great person . &quot; not girl , &quot; person . &quot;
i think you &apos;re reading a little too much into it .
&quot; you &apos;re a great person . sorry about your teeny weenie . &quot;
what do you want me to do ..
call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn &apos;t true ?
yes .
also , tell them i &apos;m skinny now .
oh ! me too !
i won &apos;t call anybody . it was a million years ago .
i don &apos;t care . you told people that i was half and half !
i never did anything to hurt you in high school .
that &apos;s not totally true .
what ?
what ?
you did start that rumor about ross ..
making out with mrs. altmann , our 50 @-@ year @-@ old librarian .
how did you know that ?
it &apos;s true ?
no .
yes , it is . i saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog .
hey , what were you doing in the library ?
they had magazines .
mrs. altmann ? she also made out ..
with ta @-@ taka @-@ ki @-@ kek the night before he went back to thailand .
in high school you made out with a 50 @-@ year @-@ old woman ?
hey , she didn &apos;t look 50 !
did she look 16 ?
there &apos;s a picture of her in the yearbook actually .
wow .
she didn &apos;t photograph well !
she probably wasn &apos;t familiar with the process ..
having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings .
how did this happen ? did she lure you to an early @-@ bird dinner ?
i was working late in the library one afternoon . it was just the two of us .
she needed some help with her word jumble .
and one thing led to another .
if you must know , anita was very gentle and tender .
may she rest in peace .
didn &apos;t she walk with a cane ?
only when it was damp !
i can &apos;t believe you told people about this . everybody knew ?
you know what ? i &apos;m back in the club !
yeah !
shall i call the meeting to order ?
is everybody present ?
with the exception of ta @-@ taka .
i wanna join !
phoebe ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i never got to be in a club . i didn &apos;t go to high school .
but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn french .
fine , you can have your stupid , little club .
but what you did to me is way worse than what i did to you .
you gave me a teeny weenie .
yeah !
you &apos;re just being silly . rachel , even with that rumor ..
you were one of the most popular girls . everyone wanted to be like you .
one girl wanted to be like you so much , she stuffed her pants with a tootsie roll .
wow .
and ross , if it weren &apos;t for her rumor , no one would &apos;ve known who you were .
she put you on the map .
as a romancer of the elderly .
mrs. altmann , you can tell , she used to be pretty .
the eyes did still sparkle .
this stuff is so way in the past . you &apos;ve been through so much since then .
you got so much more important stuff going on in your life .
can &apos;t you just let this go ?
she &apos;s right .
we are having a baby together .
hold on .
you got her pregnant ?
yeah .
are you getting married ?
no .
so you knocked her up but you &apos;re not gonna marry her . dude .
anybody ?
okay .
it &apos;s exactly how i imagined it would be .
all right , where &apos;s that turkey ?
those are my maternity pants !
no , these are my thanksgiving pants !
well , that &apos;s it . i &apos;m done .
here come the meat sweats .
well , joey , we &apos;re all very proud of you .
i believe we can expect a call from the president any moment now .
anything we can do ?
no . just nobody press on my stomach .
you can keep those pants , by the way .
what you got there ? what is that , pie ?
yeah . you want some ?
just cut me a little sliver .
little bigger .
little bigger .
