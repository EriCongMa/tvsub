I have nowhere to go.
Darling, there's really nothing I can do to help you now.
I have no resources.
Do you work in finance?
A little bit.
How much do you hate it
when people ask you for free advice?
Conrad laid waste to our family assets.
Let me help.
Call it a loan?
I like to get out and clear my head.
Should you ever want any company...
David, meet your daughter.
Do it. Shoot.
End this whole thing right now.
I owe you so much more than a quick death.
What did she want?
Charlotte.
I thought it... that it was you that she was after.
Emily wants to destroy our whole family.
Emily!
Who was that? What did you see?
Guy in sweatshirt with a knife.
I barely saw his face.
Do you see him?
No.
The system was mid-reboot. Most of the cameras were down.
Thank god I heard the motion detectors.
You could've been killed.
I'm okay, Nolan.
Barely.
Ems, there was a man in your room
with a knife,
and he was not after your stash of vintage Cartier.
He wanted blood.
Wait...
Do you think this is what Victoria had planned?
That would explain why she didn't shoot me
when she had the chance.
Of course she'd hire someone else to do her dirty work.
At least he failed.
Yeah. Well, it's my move now.
No, no, no, no.
No more moves.
I say we tag out. Let's call the police.
The police? No.
All right. Then at least let's call Jack.
He's police adjacent.
'Cause I am over this war with you and Victoria.
Nolan, we don't call the police.
Why not?
Oh, because maybe
the henchman wasn't working for Victoria alone.
Maybe little arson Annie was behind this, too.
She's not my sister.
I promised to help Charlotte.
I'm not going to sic the cops on her.
Oh, what? So she gets another spin on the murder wheel?
How many?
I'm going to search the property.
You do know that that hoodie is not a bulletproof vest,
that you can die,
and that the girl that you are so desperately trying to save
would like to see that happen sooner rather than later?
Yes, you made choices that hurt Charlotte,
and, no, you can't undo them,
but you don't have to repay her with your life.
I'm not gonna turn my back on her again.
No cops.
David?
David!
Charlotte?
You scared me.
You're hurt.
What happened?
The hood of your car is still warm.
Did you just get in?
Yes.
It was too late to drive here,
so I took a suite in the city.
So, y-you got some money?
Enough to last us for a while.
Where's Charlotte?
I don't know.
David, you were supposed to stay here last night to protect her.
I tried to.
I snuck into Emily Thorne's house last night.
What?
David, what did you do?
Did you kill her?
I came close...
But I couldn't.
Did she see you?
No.
Did anyone?
No.
Are you sure?
No one saw me.
I'm sorry.
I... I didn't mean to upset you.
But this is a different world from the one that you left.
Your re-emergence must be carefully planned,
and you'll need an alibi for the night of Conrad's death.
If you come out now,
they'll expect an explanation for where you've been.
Do you have one?
David.
All I want is the life you promised me years ago,
but we mustn't rush it.
Let me take care of things.
Yeah.
You're right.
Yeah, I'm not thinking clearly.
Get some rest, my love.
Ems?
Um, got a sec?
I was just heading out.
Another walk in the woods?
Nolan reported a break-in last night.
Why didn't you call?
Look, the alarm was off and someone got in,
but he didn't take anything, Nolan ran him off.
It wasn't a big deal.
You know I like my privacy.
Except that the, intruder had a knife, Ems.
Well, that escalates this
from breaking and entering to aggravated assault.
So, we're gonna need a statement.
Humor us,
since I've already got my pad out.
Just let them know I'm not here.
They can reach me on my cell if they really want to,
but,I don't need to have this.
Okay.
Morning.
Daniel.
Merci.
I thought we were meeting later at your place.
Yeah, well, my place isn't exactly my place anymore.
The Ripley's too expensive for me right now.
The truth is, my family's assets are depleted.
Daniel...
And before you offer,
I'll be okay, all right?
I'm a Grayson, I've survived worse.
I know you will.
But I need to tell you
that your mother came to see me last night.
She already told you about our financial situation.
What did she want?
A loan.
I'm sorry she put you in such an awkward position.
Awkward?
Well, I truly believe my father loved her.
Besides, now she owes me.
Now, that's a hell of a card to have in your hand.
How do you say "badass" in french?
I'm not sure if I qualify.
I may have handled your mother,
but the quarterly earnings are down again.
Well, I can take a look at the numbers if you want.
It's a content issue. That's what drives the numbers.
And the editorial department is lacking, so...
Hey, you shouldn't be worrying about me today.
What time is your meeting with...
Louise Ellis?
Yes.
At noon.
After drinks last night, I was up for hours
coming up with a strategy to expand her portfolio.
I mean, managing a member of one of the south's most prominent families
would be the perfect start for my wealth-management firm.
Well, this Louise would be a fool not to hire you.
You can be very charming.
I hope so.
I feel like I'm starting my life over from scratch.
I really need this to work.
Then make it work.
Because that's what we do.
Damn right.
So, you woke up when you heard Mr. Ross yell your name.
And you saw the intruder, white male, medium build,
standing over you with a knife.
Now, did you get a look at his face?
I could barely make out anything
before he jumped off the balcony.
That's got to be a 15-foot drop at least.
My guess is, the guy hurt himself.
Do you mind if I take a look at the jump site?
I'll do the honors, officer Hunter.
It's right this way.
Emily...
Don't, Jack.
I'm not involving you any more
than Nolan already has.
So I'm right to suspect that there's more here,
and, what, I'm supposed to just back off?
It was a simple break-in.
Look, the fire was one thing.
I let you stand by your statement to protect Charlotte.
But if...if this is what I think it is,
it's murder for hire.
Are you done making your statement?
Charlotte is out of your control.
You can't make the people you love change,
even if it's for their own good.
Now, if this thing is tied to Victoria
and if we can find the intruder,
we can take her down legitimately
and maybe even save Charlotte.
But what you're doing to help her,
it's-it's not working, and you're in danger.
Jack...
Can you please just let me do my job?
I can't stop you.
No, you can't.
And, Emily...
If Victoria turns up hurt
or worse...
I will arrest you.
My super needs to be fired.
I spoke to Dr. Hicks.
You polished off an old prescription of my Xanax
and then had it refilled.
Why are you going down this ugly road again?
Are you seriously asking me that?
We have all been to hell and back.
Yeah, mine was a one-way trip.
I just found out Emily is Amanda and my father is alive.
Exactly, he is alive,
and your reaction is to hide behind a haze of pills.
No. My reaction was happiness.
But you ruined that
and made meeting my father all about hurting Emily.
What do you really want from me, mom?
Nothing but to see you happy.
The Grayson mantra: lie and deny.
I'm sick of it.
I do want a relationship with my father,
but not if you're gonna be controlling it.
You are not a victim, so stop choosing to act like one.
Now, if you want a relationship with your father, fight for it.
And if you want my respect, then earn it.
But do not give in to the darkness
That will destroy you.
I mean, first the fire and then this?
What did she do, walk under a ladder and break a mirror?
You never mentioned that you ran into Emily yesterday.
Yeah. Out by the old windmill site.
She said she was out for a walk.
She didn't seem too happy to see me then, either.
Does she hate cops or something?
No, just, uh, it takes a lot for her to ask for help.
So, let's not make her ask
I'll have a couple black and whites drive by today.
For peace of mind.
I'm guessing you're planning on driving one of them.
Are you gonna tell me that you're not trying to impress Emily?
Dude, you're way off.
If I wanted to ask Emily out, I'd ask her out.
But I'm starting to feel like you'd have a problem with that.
Listen, man. I'm just trying to uncomplicate things with her.
That's all you had to say.
All right. Message received.
Loud and clear.
May I help you?
No. Sorry.
I saw that.
What?
Stay down.
Let me go.
You're under arrest.
Yeah. This should do it.
Thank you.
Hey, Townsend, who's the perp?
Some "John doe" Keller and I picked up.
Misdemeanor shoplifting.
And he was two seconds away from adding resisting arrest.
Yeah. You know how he got the limp?
Nope. Looks like it's the one thing
he brought into the store with him.
So, no weapons?
Or I.D.
We still have to run his prints through the national database.
Looks like a guy with a record a mile long.
That's called profiling, you know?
Well, who died and made you a liberal?
Hey, you've called Emily. Leave a message.
Yeah, Emily, it's Ben.
If you have time, come down to the station.
I think we may have something.
May I sit?
Does my answer matter?
Has it ever?
Yes.
What you and Charlotte think matters to me.
For all the mothering I thought I'd done,
I failed you both,
and I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to remedy that.
But for now...
Please allow me to offer some financial support.
Where'd you get this?
Well, as I told you,
your father was a master at hiding assets, so...
That should be enough to keep you and Charlotte afloat for a while.
Well, as long as Margaux doesn't make you repay it.
Man, you come with open arms and nothing but lies.
Margaux was kind enough to offer.
We're practically family.
Yeah, but you're not.
Finally, the silver lining in Pascal's death.
Oh, you're being cruel,
and if we were not in such a public place,
I would smack your mouth.
You will not speak ill of Pascal again.
Like you said,
I'm the patriarch of this family,
I'll say what I want.
Do me a favor,
stay away from Margaux, and stay away from Charlotte.
As for me, well, it should be clear.
Mrs. Grayson...
LaTour 1928 for you from a secret admirer.
No, thanks.
I was just leaving.
I'm sorry, Ms. Ellis, but Mrs. Grayson declined.
Well, did you tell her it was LaTour 1928?
As you requested.
This was a stupid idea!
The gesture was lovely.
A glass from a $20,000 bottle of champs
is more than lovely, dear.
You enjoy it.
Thanks.
Well, who needs champagne?
At no point during the lineup
are you to attempt communication of any kind with anyone.
Step forward only when your number is called.
Are we clear?
Head up, number three.
David.
File them out.
You okay, Porter?
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I just finished, uh, prepping the lineup.
Now I got to... I got to go.
You need to get this one right.
A break-in at the Grayson Manor will set off panic alarms,
and the last thing we need is a rash of unsolved home invasions.
Right. Yes, sir.
You took the initial statement, correct?
Yes. Um, yeah.
Take a minute. Fill me in.
Yeah, let me call you back.
Hi. I'm glad you could make it.
I left word for Mr. Ross, as well.
You're the first to arrive.
You guys work fast.
Well, a guy matching your description
came in on another case.
He even had a leg injury.
So, we thought it was worth a look.
So, you were just lucky?
Or incredibly skillful.
Look, if we do find the intruder,
could you please tell your partner
to call off the squad car parked outside of my house?
Well, I could, but I sent it.
Look. I know you're no damsel in distress, all right?
I was just trying to give you
some peace of mind after a traumatic night.
Well, thank you, but I --
Yeah, I know --
you can take care of yourself.
I keep forgetting that you were in juvie.
We're following up with Mr. Ross and Ms. Thorne --
Ms. Thorne.
Chief Alvarez.
We've actually met.
Right, at my wedding. Victoria invited you.
Well, I'll let you get to it.
Trust me, you're in capable hands.
Thanks, chief.
Thanks.
So, we good?
Ben, I need to speak with Emily for a minute.
Alone.
What, are you forgetting protocol?
You prepped the lineup,
you can't speak to the witness in private.
A first-year law student would have that I.D. tossed at trial.
Come on. You talk to her after.
All right. Bring them out.
Now, Emily, I know you only caught a glimpse.
Just -- just take your time.
Number three.
Number three, step forward.
Em.
There's no reason to be intimidated.
All right? He can't see you.
I know.
Are you ready to make an I.D.?
No.
It's not him.
Just take your time.
I'm sure.
I don't recognize anyone.
You still checking out my portfolio?
You can afford to take some more risks.
Your buys have been way too conservative.
Says the guy in a suit at a pool.
Come on. It's summer, it's hot as hellfire.
Don't you want to get in and cool off,
then we can talk some business?
I'd rather talk about increasing your return.
I could give you some quick fixes,
but you need a more comprehensive overhaul.
Trust me.
And why should I trust you?
I don't know anything about you --
except for your last name.
Well, don't hold that against me.
Tabloids print lies.
Mm. My brother's in politics --
I'm aware of how papers are sold.
It's all lies and sex.
Why don't you tell me something about yourself?
Something personal, like, um...
tell me about your mother.
Says a lot about a man's character,
how he gets along with his mama.
Well, we don't have the best relationship.
Why?
Short answer --
she meddles.
Well, at least she cares.
I wasn't even worth meddling to my mother.
I went never good enough, smart enough, or pretty enough.
One time, when I was 14,
I put a "Hex" on her to make her love me.
Did it work?
Oh, no, darlin'.
Nothing can fix the devil.
My mama and I, we'll never mend things,
but...
I'd give anything to start over with a great mom, you know?
Well, maybe we're better off.
So, tell me --
what does your mama meddle with?
That's a story for another day.
But you can trust me, okay?
I want to make you a lot of money, Louise.
The question is, what do you want?
Tell you what --
how about I test your NASDAQ picks while you help me out?
I need to know you have my back.
Hey, I just got Ben's message.
What's is happening? What is going on?
Ems?
Em?
Babe, you're freaking me out.
What happened?
Ems?
My father...
He's alive.
What -- what are you talking about?
I just saw him in the lineup.
But...
No, no, no. No, no.
I swear to god, Nolan. It was him!
No...
How is this possible?
After everything I...
It was him, Nolan --
In my house last night. It had to have been.
But why -- why would he break into my house?
Why would he want to hurt me?
I don't know. I -- I don't know.
Em.
What the hell, man? Is this real?
It is.
His fingerprints just came back from the D.O.J.
He was arrested on the edge of town.
He was bruised and disoriented.
Jack...
Please. I need to see him.
I'll find a way.
Okay.
What is this about, Edward?
I'm sorry to have brought you in here like this, Victoria.
I heard you were back in the city,
so I had the NYPD on the lookout.
Well, your officers sneak me through the back entrance.
Am I in trouble?
No. No, not at all.
Given our long history,
I thought a face-to-face might be best...
before the story breaks.
Maybe you should have a seat.
My officers arrested a man today
whose prints came back as those of David Clarke.
I know this must be shocking to you, to say the least.
Your head must be spinning with a thousand questions,
but trust me, we'll get answers.
What did he say? Where has he been?
Well, unfortunately, Mr. Clarke isn't speaking,
but the investigation as to his whereabouts these past years is under way,
as well as a possible connection
to a break-in in your former residence.
Now, listen, Victoria.
I don't want to frighten you,
but you may have been the intended victim.
I'm sorry.
Th-this is all a bit much.
Could I...
could I have a moment alone, please?
Sure.
I'll get you some water.
Do you know what you're gonna say to your father?
No.
It's too late.
No, it's not.
You cleared his name, he is a free man,
they cannot hold him.
They can if he escaped from prison,
if he faked his own death.
And what about last night?
Ems, no!
Sorry. The precinct's shutting down. No visitors.
I-I'm not a visitor.
I'm, I'm here to see officer Porter.
Ma'am, do we have a problem?
Well, I guess the news is out about David Clarke.
Ms. Thorne here was one of the first to see him in a lineup.
I just want answers.
Officer, escort her out of here.
Look. I know you want to get it here and see him for your friend.
I'm starting to think
it's what kept you from making an I.D. earlier.
All right, we have to let the feds handle this,
and there's nothing you can do right now except wait,
so just go home, please.
Amanda wouldn't want me to.
Ems...
it's time to go.
Let's go home.
Please.
Please.
Louise sent over a nice little retainer
into my account this afternoon,
so I am back in business and back in the penthouse.
The concierge even sent up some champagne to welcome me back.
You can be very persuasive.
Well, I may need you
to help me woo a few award-winning journalists
over to Lemarchal.
Ah, you're a rockstar, babe. You don't need my help.
I want to hear about everything.
What about Louise? What is she like?
How about you swing by later for dinner?
I'll tell you all about it.
I would love that.
Until then.
All right.
Louise.
I thought we were done for the day.
Oh, we are.
I saw you check in earlier.
I'm in penthouse A, remember?
Right. Right.
And I thought
we might be able to celebrate our new partnership in person.
It's LaTour 1928.
My mother loves the stuff.
D-did you send over a glass to my mom earlier?
No, why?
It's just that, uh, that's her favorite, too.
Oh, well...
You know, they say,
"Coincidence is God's way of staying anonymous."
And meeting you was definitely divine intervention.
Now, I know this sounds hippy dippy and all,
but I swear if you just ask the universe for something,
most of the time, it will just land right in your lap.
Well, I'll remember that.
Oh, before I forget, I have one more thing for you.
Close your eyes.
Do it.
Okay. Open.
Rule Number One --
no more suits.
Rule Number Two --
if we're going to be working together,
I'm gonna need you to squeeze in a little play time.
Maybe by the pool?
Unless...
you have a problem with that?
Not at all.
Great!
And to think I almost didn't walk into that bar last night.
Well, okay.
You enjoy your champagne.
Toodles.
Toodles.
Mr. Clarke...
I'm Agent Stiegel with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
This interview is being recorded.
Do you understand?
I'm Susan Luke.
I've been retained to represent Mr. Clarke.
Retained by whom?
Victoria.
Get her out of here. Now.
Actually, I'd like you all to clear the room.
Mr. Clarke has the right
to confer with counsel.
I don't need that.
Mr. Clarke -- - I just want to tell the truth.
It's all I have left.
I'm not a terrorist.
I was framed...
and taken from my daughter.
I was stabbed in prison,
but I didn't die.
Conrad Grayson -- he faked my death,
and then he locked me away for years.
I was tortured.
I...
Please continue, Mr. Clarke.
Conrad, he paid guards
just to crush any hope that I had left.
I saw a chance to run. I took it.
And that's when I was arrested.
But I know that...
Conrad will -- will find me.
He'll kill me.
Mr. Clarke, Conrad Grayson cannot hurt you.
He's evil. You don't understand.
David, Conrad is dead.
He was killed six months ago.
Before he died, he admitted...
to framing you.
Your name has been cleared.
Now, Mr. Clarke,
we're gonna need you to lead us to where Mr. Grayson kept you.
Yeah.
Can you do that?
Y-yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I think I can.
I'd like to request that Mr. Clarke be released.
The government will need to vet his version of events.
Of course.
But I assure you
that Mr. Clarke is not a flight risk.
This is a broken and frightened man
who will cooperate with this investigation.
Please, let him come home...
with me.
Are they reporting anything yet?
No.
Listen...
After I lost my dad...
all I ever wished for was just to see him one more time.
I'd settle for five minutes...
one more kiss good night.
Your wish came true.
God, I can't wrap my head around any of this.
Ems. Look.
We join Chief Edward Alvarez now.
Do you have David Clarke in custody?
It is true that David Clarke is alive.
In his first statement,
Mr. Clarke reports that he was held by Conrad Grayson,
beaten and tortured for 10 years.
Although his assertion is still subject to confirmation,
the FBI has decided to release David Clarke on good faith.
After this 20-year ordeal,
David Clarke is finally a free man.
He's expected to make a public statement within the next hour.
My God.
That's it. No questions. Thank you.
I knew Conrad was evil, but this...
I should have killed him myself.
Ems, breathe.
I'm going down there.
I need to see my dad tonight.
I know you want to, but not like this.
Ems, not in public.
You both deserve so much more.
We deserved more 20 years ago.
I can't wait one more day.
Charlotte's on her way down. She's worried sick.
The way the news is reporting this,
they assume you're fragile.
I'm not.
I know.
In that interrogation room,
I remembered the man I fell in love with --
smart, a risk taker,
a man who was willing to go to any lengths
to do what you did today,
to finally reveal what happened to him.
David...
you know you can tell me anything.
When I was locked away,
I analyzed everything...
even you.
Do you remember how I wanted us to leave
weeks before I was arrested for Flight 197
and you said, "Let me take care of things"?
This morning, you said the same thing.
I won't be anyone's prisoner anymore...
not even yours, Victoria.
You grabbed me, and I stayed.
I never held you hostage.
I was trying to keep you safe.
You had six months of unaccounted-for time,
and I am never going to let you go down for Conrad's death.
That's why I retained a lawyer --
a better lawyer than you and I can afford.
I did it for you.
For us.
Mr. Clarke, we're ready to process your release.
You still need me, David.
And I will always need you.
David?
So, I just got you all to myself
and now I have to share you with your this new client?
Oh, is somebody jealous?
Who?
Me? No.
Yeah, you're jealous.
Oh, no, I'm not. No, no.
No?
No.
Well, that's too bad.
Why?
'Cause I kind of like it.
Fire whoever's on that phone.
Margaux Lemarchal.
Is it confirmed?
Okay, run it immediately, all media outlets.
And we need a presence at that press conference.
He now says his murder was a smokescreen.
Conrad Grayson kidnapped him in prison...
and then held him in a silo
on a remote Grayson property.
It's David Clarke.
Mr. Clarke has agreed to cooperate with the FBI...
He's alive.
as they continue to investigate
his harrowing story.
Mr. Clarke is expected to make a public statement
in just a few minutes.
Hey, you all right, man?
Yeah.
Yeah. Sorry for freaking out in the lineup.
What, are you kidding?
Come on. That guy's your father-in-law, right?
Look, I understand, but you should've filled me in.
I know. I'm sorry.
I just...
thought maybe I was seeing things
until I saw Emily's reaction.
Yeah, well, she's pretty upset.
She tried to get past the Feds.
She wants answers just like you, for Amanda.
Well, listen. I think I'm gonna --
I'm gonna go.
What, now?
But he's about to be released.
You must have a ton of questions for him.
D-don't you at least want to meet him
after all this time?
No.
And if it's all the same to you,
I don't want him knowing I'm on the force yet.
I'm just --
I'm not ready to see him.
After hours of speculation,
we are now moments away from a live statement
from the man formerly found guilty
of one of the most heinous acts of terror
this country has ever seen.
Given his sensational and surprising tale
of the past 10 years,
it is safe to say David Clarke, once hated,
may now be the new symbol of hope and courage.
Thank you for coming.
I'm here for him, not you.
I-I prayed for this moment,
this freedom,
and today, uh, my prayers were answered.
And I never imagined seeing this kind of support
from a public who had condemned me
and a family that I thought had forgotten about me.
He shouldn't be up there alone.
No, no, no. Just wait.
Victoria...
Charlotte...
please join me?
Mrs. Grayson,
seems your family can't escape the ghosts of the past.
Charlotte and I are focused on the future...
and getting to know David once again.
David has been through a --
a horrific experience
at the hands of my late ex-husband,
Conrad Grayson, who was an evil, evil man.
We all need time to understand and to process.
We ask for privacy at this moment
so that David could readjust
and to be with loved ones...
and his family.
That's all the questions for now.
What just happened?
