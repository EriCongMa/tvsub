Mrs. Dilaurentis has offered to let us stay with her.
You're gonna sleep in Ali's old bed?
No! Hell no. I'm not moving in there.
Em, you have to.
You knew I wasn't his father.
I gave myself the answer that I wanted.
You let me fall in love with him.
I'm sorry.
My mom used to play this song all the time.
"A" is telling you to ditch Eddie Lamb
and go for Dr. Palmer.
How much longer do you need me to keep this a secret?
We have to face facts.
We're not gonna be together next year.
They're alleging that I bullied mona into giving her confession.
What does that mean?
Your mother doesn't have a lawyer.
how jealous were you tonight?
It definitely looks like somebody used this
as their temporary home.
Should we call the police?
I'm sure they're long gone.
Do you actually think she's been living in that crawl space?
Aria, there was a sleeping bag.
But napping isn't living.
Unless you're a reptile, which kind of describes Cece.
Least the Cece that Mrs. Dilaurentis remembers.
But not just Mrs. D,
even Shana's scared of this girl.
Yeah, well I'm scared of Shana.
She's not the one who used Jenna's head
as batting practice at your birthday party.
Yeah, why is Cece going after Jenna?
Why would she go after any of us?
We had nothing to do with her getting kicked out of college.
We have no idea what Ali could've told her.
What could Ali have possibly said that would make Cece
hate us enough to drill holes under Ali's house
and stare up Emily's skirt?
How am I supposed to live in that house?
Hang out on the second floor.
And wear underwear at all times.
I'm eating this.
Hey. Where you been?
Uh, with my mom.
She met another lawyer.
How'd it go?
Not great.
They're all just bottom-feeders
trying to make a name for themselves.
There are other ones.
Em, she's met all of them.
They don't care what happens to her.
She's just... case number 79.
Your mom's gonna find somebody who really cares about her.
She already found someone who cared.
Why can't you tell your mom to ask the judge
to get back on that case?
'Cause "A" took her down, Hanna.
Spencer, talk to her.
Please.
My mom trusts her. She needs her.
I know, and my mom is not deserting her.
She just-- she has to figure out
What kind of role she can play
without compromising your mom's defense.
What is she doing here?
Who?
Lieutenant Tanner.
Why is she at our school?
Doubt it's for the baked ziti.
Hello, ladies. May I join?
I hear you and your mother moved in with a neighbor.
Must be nice not having to use a desk as an ironing board.
Have you been back to your house since the accident?
No, I haven't.
Well I'm just here, ladies,
to remind you that the local p.D.
still investigating.
Did they find out who was driving that car?
No.
Not yet.
Oh, but they did find something interesting
while they were sorting through the wreckage.
What? What was it?
A shoe.
A muddy shoe...
That, believe it or not,
matches the shoeprints
from the Wilden crime scene...
which falls under my jurisdiction.
Do they know whose shoe it is?
Well we spoke to your mother, Emily.
We know it's not hers.
And we have ways of testing these things out.
You know, D.N.A. And stuff.
Something wrong, Hanna?
No, I'm just--
I have to use the restroom.
Geez, I hope I didn't ruin anyone's lunch.
Hanna.
Hanna, come on, don't let Tanner freak you out
about a muddy shoe.
It's probably not even why she came here.
Oh, really? It was about the baked ziti?
No, look, "A" put that shoe in Emily's house
'cause Mona made a crazy move.
Why does "A" care what Mona says?
Because her confession screwed with "A's" perfect plan
to frame your mother.
Yeah, and Tanner's just fishing to see
if we were the ones who put Mona up to it.
She's been after me since that "guilty" video
was delivered to the police.
Okay, she's just trying to scare us into spilling something.
Yeah, well it worked. My breakfast.
We need to put Cece on Tanner's radar.
How are we supposed to do that?
Just invite her into the crawlspace?
No, we are gonna go into the crawlspace
this afternoon, after school,
and hopefully find some proof
that Cece's back in town and living down there.
If we go down there, Mrs. D. Is gonna start asking questions.
Well Mrs. D. isn't gonna be there
'cause Hanna's going shopping with her.
For what? Things to wear while visiting my mother
on a chain gang?
No. Tonight's dance.
Spencer! I am not going to that hoedown!
Okay? I cannot leave my mother alone.
You don't have to go to the hoedown.
You just have to waste an hour or two with Mrs. D.
trying on bolo ties, okay?
And you two are gonna meet me underneath the house at 4:00.
Okay.
You okay?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, no-- I'm gonna meet you guys under the house. Okay?
Hey, there.
Is tonight still happening?
Tonight?
The dance.
We don't have to go.
Not really good at line dancing, anyway.
Yeah, I don't know. Uh, maybe?
I have a lot of stuff going on, but...
I'll call you.
What's that?
A recommendation letter.
Nice. Zoe came through?
Yeah.
It's long.
And gushing.
Yeah. That's how Zoe talks.
Really? About every volunteer?
Her spirit made my heart race?
She's poetic.
She's into you.
She's being supportive.
Emily, I've been to weddings
where people don't say stuff like this in their vows.
I have to get to class.
Aria.
What are you doin' here?
I was gonna offer you a lift home,
but it looks like--
Yeah, I drove myself.
Uh, wanna take a detour for a coffee?
I'll--I'll tailgate you.
Love to, but I-- I have so much stuff I have to do today.
That's cool.
I just wanted to pass on a name
of a hot-shot attorney who's a friend of the family.
Oh, that's so sweet of you.
I don't know what happened
between Spencer's mom and Hanna's, but--
Think, um, Mrs. Marin's already found somebody else.
Yeah.
Do you two-step?
In a parking lot?
In a barn in Watertown tonight.
The school's throwing this western thingy.
Would you wanna go?
Yes.
Okay.
What?
You change your mind?
No, that...was just so easy.
What's wrong with easy?
Nothing.
It's...just been a long time
since I could go to a school dance with somebody that I'm...
Dating.
What time should your date pick you up?
Busy?
I should be.
What is that?
Well, I did what you suggested
and I reached out to my supervisor in Haiti.
She wrote this.
Are you growing a beard?
What?
No.
This is glowing.
What's the problem.
Is it too glowing?
I mean does it sound like my mother wrote it?
Emily, there are people with real problems in the world,
and getting a glowing college recommendation
isn't one of them.
Sorry I bothered you.
Emily--
I have a lot on my mind right now.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you.
Is this about Aria?
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked you that.
Maggie is moving across the country
and taking Malcolm with her.
W--how can she just do that?
I mean, you're Malcolm's father.
I'd like to be the first to tell Aria,
so I'd really appreciate if you wouldn't say anything.
Hanna, hey.
Do you need a ride?
Uh, no. I'm going shopping
at Macy's with Mrs. Dilaurentis.
What--you're shopping with Alison's mom?
Well I can't with my own.
Her ankle brace would go off
any time she opens a window too fast.
Right.
Well, okay, then I guess I'll just come by
and pick you up for the round-up.
No, we don't have to go to that--
Actually, we do.
Your mom texted me during chem.
She told me to grab you at 8:00.
It was an order.
She wants you to live your life, Han.
Whatever.
Come on, giddy-up, little doggie.
It was in Hanna's locker.
Why would Cece use an envelope
from the place where she used to work?
She wouldn't.
So you don't think it's Cece?
I don't know who it is.
Well it's just such a careless move.
Do you think she wants us to find out it's her?
There are easier ways to do it.
Well why is she suddenly gifting you and Hanna--
Spencer, I don't feel like asking questions,
and not when I'm getting answers.
Yeah, and they also feed turkeys
lots of tasty treats before they chop their heads off.
I just don't understand why Hanna would be given a gift
the same day her mother's muddy shoe suddenly shows up.
What is it?
*Anytime*
Who's singing?
*You're feeling blue*
My mother.
What? Where did you get this?
I don't--I don't...know.
You didn't put this in here?
Take it out!
Toby, please! Please take this out right now!
Hey, how you doin'? Can--can I get a water?
Are you looking for me?
Look, I don't know who you are
or why you find me so damn interesting,
but if you don't stop,
you're gonna be one sorry stalker.
I'll go to Palmer tonight.
I-if he can remember where he stored the rest of these--
Toby, Palmer is not a reliable source.
Okay, he thought that I was your mother!
He thought that Mrs. Dilaurentis was--
He may remember where he kept the rest of his sessions.
Look, this is a classic "A" move.
I mean, if "A" wasn't being devious,
why did she have to break into your car
to deliver this to you?
She was probably hoping you'd hear it
and you'd wrap your truck around a tree.
I'm gonna see Palmer tonight.
You wanna come with me or not?
Not.
I'm meeting Aria and Emily.
Why?
So we can find signs of Cece
in that frickin' crawlspace.
What are you doing?
Who are you calling?
Palmer.
Toby, do you understand what is happening?
You are completely under "A's" spell.
Can we please, please,
just take a breath and try to prove that Cece
is "A" before we make another move?
Saratoga Gardens.
How may I direct your call?
Hello?
Hello?
Where's Spencer?
Always has the best flashlight.
Isn't she the one that said to meet at 4:00?
Yeah, she'll be here.
When was the last time you spoke with Ezra?
It's been a while. Why?
You should call him.
Why? What's going on?
He just mention that he's been trying to reach you.
He has.
But I can't do that to Jake.
I spent our first three dates
trying to convince him that I was available,
and now I-- now I finally feel like I am.
What is that?
A button.
Do you think it belongs to red coat?
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Yeah, so are we. You could've announced yourself.
Hi, I'm spencer. I'm climbing into the crawlspace.
Where have you been?
I was with Toby. Just--
Stuff's going on.
Yeah, there's been a lot of stuff going on for a while now,
ever since he gave "A" that lair.
Have you found anything?
A button.
Lemme see.
Told you she has the best flashlight.
I thought Mrs. D. was with Hanna.
没错 迪劳伦提斯夫人和我在一起 - - 汉娜
Wait, go back. How many knitting needles were there?
Does there need to be more than one?
I'm just saying there could
have been more than one person up there.
There was one person, one heavy-footed person
who knew exactly where those holes were.
Em, this could help us.
If that person is Cece, we can trap her--
Maybe with the diva dish envelope;
when you go back there, you should--
If I go back there, it's to pack up my suitcase, okay?
I'm not sleeping in that house again.
I'll move in here.
Moving in where?
Here. Your bedroom, this couch--
Anywhere where there's carpeting.
Do you wanna do this tonight?
Yeah. Is that a problem?
Who were you talking to upstairs?
Toby. Why? What did I miss?
What did we miss?
Spence, it's like you're living a double life.
What makes you think I'm living a double life?
Because I have and I know exactly what it looks like.
Every time Toby calls,
you leave the room, your mood changes.
Are you pregnant?
Shut up, Hanna.
Okay, it's like you're here but you're not.
We get it. We understand you have a boyfriend.
We've all had them.
Yeah, even Emily.
Shut up, Hanna.
Okay but we don't put anyone above our friendship.
I'm not putting him above you guys.
I just--Toby is--
He's dealing with some really serious stuff.
Spencer,
Hanna's mom might be going to prison, like, for real.
Emily's got a car parked in her living room,
And I nearly lost an eye this afternoon.
I think...
all of our stuff ranks on the "serious" charts.
I promised him.
We know.
Spence, what's the deal?
Is Toby working with "A" Again?
No.
But "A" is giving him gifts, too.
Toby's mother might have been murdered.
Yeah, I know he's not well. You told me that earlier.
It is just a quick question!
Could you please just get someone
to get Dr. Palmer on the phone?
Fine, thanks. You've been a big help.
Well, at least I know you didn't lose it.
Or throw it in the river.
Yeah. Um...
I'm sorry, Ezra. Things have just been...
pretty busy.
No worries.
You're here now.
True.
I-I can't really talk right now.
W--is there another time
we can get together?
I have something I--
would rather not say it over the phone.
Hey.
H!
Um, I-I just sat down and then I saw Ezra from--
Um, Ezra, this is Jake. Jake, Ezra.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too.
So I should actually get going.
I've got a lot of work to do.
But...it was nice meting you.
Wow, that was weird.
I--I had no idea that he was gonna be here.
Don't sweat it.
It's a...small town.
What's this?
Open it.
You did not buy me--
Try 'em on.
Here?
Yeah. I'll help you.
Seriously, though, how'd you know my size?
It's a gift.
And a great party trick.
How does it feel?
I think people are staring at us.
The boot.
It's perfect.
Toby can't trust "A" anymore.
I made that really clear.
How can I help?
Um, just grab my stuff in the bathroom.
Oh, and check the shower.
Yeah.
Stop moving.
I can't help it. It tickles.
Get over it.
You need to break up with Ben.
What?
Why?
Because you deserve better.
He's a flathead. And deep down, you know it's not right.
Sometimes it feels right.
Please. Mushy squash.
He's not that bad.
That's what's left on the buffet table
after everyone's made their choices, em.
You don't make decisions,
and that's what you'll end up with.
Ben really cares about me.
And I don't want to hurt him.
Stop taking care of everyone but yourself.
Alison--
You need to be careful at what you're good at, hon,
'cause you'll spend the rest of your life doing it.
And if you need me to do the deed, I'm happy to.
What "deed"?
Breaking up with Ben.
I've done it for lots of people.
That's so wrong.
Who would ask you to do something like that?
Sometimes people don't have a choice.
Friend of mine was involved
with this really scary dude.
She couldn't do it, so I stepped in.
But the bitch didn't tell me that he had a gun--
which he pulled on me.
What?! Who!
A boy at our school has a gun?
You don't know him.
He doesn't go to our school...
Anymore.
Other foot.
Hey. This is everything.
What's wrong?
Did you know that Ali once had a gun pulled on her?
What?
Ali used to help people break up with their boyfriends
when they didn't want to deal with it themselves.
What if that was a favor she did for Cece,
And that creepy dude was Wilden?
Whoa, Emily, slow down.
No, w-when I saw that photo
of wilden with his arms around Ali and Cece,
I assumed that he was seeing Ali.
What if Cece was dating Jason and Wilden?
So what if she was?
Maybe when she came back to Rosewood,
he tried to hook up with her,
and the only way to get rid of him was to kill him?
Hello?
Where are you?
I'm not waiting here forever.
And I sure as hell am not going back to Rosewood.
Call me.
Should've come here on horseback.
Oh, come on. Go with it, Han.
Well, what'll it be, ma'am?
Can I get you a nice, tall glass of sarsaparilla?
Do you wanna dance?
What?
Dance with me.
Okay, are you out of your mind?
Why would I wanna dance with you?
Because I put that envelope in your locker.
I know your mom's innocent.
Who are you?
I was at the lake that night.
Wilden called us to tow his car out.
Look, my family owns the garage on the corner of broadmoor and lasher.
Wait, you were at the lake that night?
Yeah, your mom was there talking to Wilden.
She didn't see me, but I saw her drive off.
I heard gunshots...
after I saw your mom drive away.
And I saw someone running through the woods.
Who? Who did you see?
I don't know, but it was a girl.
Hey, Hanna.
You, uh, hate this, we can switch.
I got lemonade, so...
Um, actually can you hold that for one second?
I just--
I have to dance with--
Travis.
Yeah. one of Aria's...
brother's friends from lacrosse.
It was a bet.
So, come on, Travis. Let's dance.
Why'd you wait so long?
It's complicated.
I know complicated.
Look, my dad and Wilden-- there's bad blood between them.
My dad could've looked just as guilty as your mom looks now.
That still doesn't get you off the hook.
It was me and a dead body.
Who's gonna believe me when I say I saw someone
running through the woods?
Was that somebody a blonde?
It was very dark, but I think so.
Where'd the cash come from?
When I saw his body, I--
I panicked. I left my truck at the lake.
Then it showed up later at the garage.
That envelope was on the seat,
so whoever delivered that thought it would shut me up.
Well it did.
Howdy, Caleb. How's it going?
What are they serving?
Uh, I would just stick with water.
Everything else tastes like cough syrup.
Where's Hanna?
She's dancing off some bet with one of your brother's teammates.
You know anything about that?
Oh--yeah, Mike is so immature.
I'll have a water. Please.
It's not as hard as it looks.
My father taught me how to two-step.
He learned at the base.
In Texas, it's part of basic training.
Well we should all be drafted
because I don't know the difference between a two-step and a polka.
But...you'll lead,
right, Toby?
Sure.
What's a polka?
Did you know that Paige was gonna be here?
Um, sorta.
She didn't know that I was, though.
I don't get it.
If you were so scared of looking guilty,
why would you leave your truck at the lake?
I-I freaked out, okay?
It was stupid, I know.
But I can't hide that money anymore.
Your mom needs it.
No.
You have to speak to the police.
Look, I-I'm not gonna sell out my own family to save yours.
All right, the police should've figured this out by now.
Well they haven't!
And now they have physical proof
that my mom was there at the lake that night.
And she's looking guiltier every minute.
So what are you gonna do about it?
I've done everything that I'm gonna do.
So this kid falls out of the sky now?
Hanna, "A" delivered that truck.
"A" put that money in there.
How do you know this kid isn't working for "A"?
How can you trust this guy?
You're right. I can't.
But I'm gonna have to.
帕默的旧车在东盘山路1071号 -A
Wanna dance?
Sure.
Hey, there.
Hi.
Jake, what can I do for you?
You could start by giving us a little bit more space.
I'm sorry?
I'm guessing being a chaperone wasn't mandatory tonight.
Now you gotta have better things to do
on a Friday night, dude.
Look, if you think I'm here
because--
I know why you're here.
And I know why you're hurting, man...
but you gotta let her move on.
I'll take two lemonades, please.
Did Emily say anything to you?
About what?
Nothing.
Hey, look, if you don't wanna dance, we don't--
No, no, no. I do. I do.
Just--
I got an address now for Palmer's car
and I wanna go there.
What? Where did you get that?
It's less than two miles away from here,
and if--if those last sessions
with my mother are in there--
Is this what was on your phone?
Another gift?
Toby, who are you here with, me or "A"?
Why are you trying to keep me from knowing the truth?
It's like I bring this up and I get shut down.
No, I'm not shutting you down, okay?
I just don't wanna see this thing blow up in your face.
I know what I'm doing.
No, you don't.
That's the thing. None of us do.
Okay, we're all just trying to make this up
as we go along,
but everybody thinks that you're playing with f--
Who's "Everybody"?
Who else knows about my mother?
Did you tell your friends?
Why would you do that?
Now that-- that will be the last text that I ever get.
That's for the best.
Okay, I didn't mean to--
I trusted you.
I know.
But keeping this a secret has meant
that I've had to choose between you and them.
Right.
And you chose them.
Hey, hey, did you drive here?
Yeah. Why? Do you need a ride?
No, I need you to follow Toby.
Here, just gimme those plates, okay?
I'll feed Hanna.
W-what is going on?
I think "A's" trying to set him up.
But I need you to go now, quick,
before he pulls out of the lot, please.
Go.
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey. Who was that guy Hanna was dancing with earlier?
I didn't see him.
Uh, have you spoken to Ezra?
Um, no.
He's right over there.
Yeah, Emily, I know.
I just don't want a repeat of this afternoon.
We had the weirdest pile-up today at the brew.
I mean, Ezra just--
he looked like this wet, sad puppy, and Jake--
Did you ever even call him?
I can't, Emily, I told you.
How is Jake supposed to believe that it's really over?
Okay, this isn't about Jake.
He's losing Malcolm.
First he loses you,
and now Maggie's moving his kid across the country.
He's in a really bad place.
That's what he wanted to talk about?
You left before we could finish.
I told you everything I knew.
This money is not gonna help my mom
or you.
You have to give it to the police.
Do not give me that.
I know how it feels to be blackmailed.
Okay, you can't wish it away.
You have to do something.
I'm not selling out my own dad.
Travis, my mom still believes that
the truth will get her out of this.
And you're holding that truth.
Look, I know you're scared.
But you wouldn't have come to me
if you weren't ready to do the right thing.
Hey, where the hell is Hanna?
I don't know, but I think I saw "red coat."
What? Wait, where? Was it Cece?
I don't know. It was a flash, and then she disappeared.
I looked up for a second right over there.
There she is.
I see someone... heading down the main road.
Oh, excuse me. Can we please borrow your truck?
Uh, no.
Last hay ride is at 9:30.
No, no, no. We don't want a hay ride.
We just--we need to catch up with our friend.
Well I'm sorry, pippy longstocking,
but, uh, I'm done for the night.
Ezra, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea what was going on.
It was Emily who told you?
She had to.
Look, I-I thought that you were calling me because--
We don't have to do this now.
No, if I would've known--
It's okay, Aria.
I have no right to be invading your life with my problems.
You should get back to Jake.
Hurry!
I-I can't get it into first gear.
Is your foot on the brake?
No, it's on the clutch.
Do you wanna try this?
Seriously, this was not on my driver's ed test.
带上杰克 我们在侧门 快点
Don't do it.
What are you doing here?
I'm stopping you from doing something really stupid.
You don't know what's going on. Just leave me alone.
All I know is that Spencer
is really freaked out that you're here.
I don't need an intervention.
Just go back to the party.
If this has anything to do with "A,"
then you need a reality check.
I just have a couple more questions.
You realize you will have to repeat this
or you might have to repeat this in front of a judge.
I understand that.
Do you think you could identify the person
you saw running through the woods?
I'm not sure.
But you are absolutely sure
that you heard the gunshots
after Mrs. Marin drove off?
Yes, ma'am.
She wasn't there when he was killed.
There's nothing.
Hey, well at least we have that.
Is it missing a button?
Yep.
Listen, I'm gonna call Toby.
I'm really worried about him.
Well she can't be two places at once.
And Cece was already here.
Yeah, but we don't know where she went.
I don't want to be the person that ends up with mushy squash.
Are you drunk?
No.
What are you trying to say?
I'm saying that I wanna dance with you.
Now.
Before they turn the lights off.
You didn't have to come.
I wanted to.
Is Jake out there...
waiting for you?
No, he dropped me at home. I came by myself.
What happened with Malcolm?
It's a--it's a mess,
Aria,
and I'd...
really rather not...
drag you into it.
I'm not leaving, Ezra.
Okay, so you might as well talk to me.
