&quot; puzzle with a missing piece &quot;
oh , boy . hold on one second .
i got lost here yesterday .
i love puzzles .
since i was a kid .
nope , your present hasn &apos;t come yet .
what is this present ?
you keep saying i &apos;ll know when i see it .
when am i gonna see it ?
yes , mom , i am still at work .
i &apos;ve got all the last guy &apos;s caseload , plus new patients .
there &apos;s almost no time for research .
yes , i &apos;ve made friends .
&quot; what are their names , &quot; mom ?
my record for the friday new york times crossword
is 11 minutes ... when i was 13 .
i &apos;m still trying to beat that .
why do i need to make friends ? i &apos;m here to run a department .
okay , that sounds braggy .
i just mean once i pick a puzzle up ,
i can &apos;t put it down until it &apos;s solved .
no , i haven &apos;t talked to her yet .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to .
i &apos;ve gotten by just fine without a sister .
i don &apos;t need one now . at least not this one .
i was curious . i picked up the rock .
i saw what was underneath it . i &apos;m gonna put the rock back .
it was stupid to have picked it up in the first place .
no , i &apos;m just saying i don &apos;t need answers about my birth mom .
i have a family . i have the best family i could ask for .
i have you guys .
dad . dad , stop crying .
i &apos;m not coming home . mom . tell him i &apos;m not coming home .
oh , guys , i love you . i got to go .
i think puzzles are why i went into medicine .
that &apos;s most of what medicine is .
gather all available information ...
how long has she been down ?
less than a minute .
she bradycardia , and then she went asystole .
we started cpr .
... assess the problem ...
that &apos;s not gonna do it . let me .
... you focus your attention ...
shoot , i &apos;m gonna break her ribs .
sorry , marjorie . hold on .
v @-@ fib . paddles , please . charge 100 .
charged . clear .
charge 200 .
charging . clear .
... and you solve the puzzle .
thank you . thank you .
people are a harder puzzle .
there &apos;s never one right answer .
oh , no , thanks . i &apos;m going down .
me , too .
and you never have all of the information .
i mean down the stairs . you know , heart health .
you both work here . you can &apos;t keep avoiding her .
i came here to work . that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
when i have to work with dr. grey , i will .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s all you came here for .
look , can we go back to before i opened my mouth
about my personal problems ?
and we can just be work colleagues .
can we do that , please ?
number 32 down is &quot; corn pone . &quot;
took me forever .
when are you gonna talk to lebackes ?
not till i &apos;m sure i have my old job back .
dr. willis ?
i thought this board appointment was a done deal .
thank you . but now that i have to compete for it --
dr. willis .
i think lebackes will understand .
i just have to find the right moment .
dr. willis .
i think she &apos;s talking to you .
oh , hi !
i think you &apos;re with me today . you ready for rounds ?
yes .
sorry , but it &apos;s -- it &apos;s wilson , not willis .
oh , god . i &apos;m so sorry .
that &apos;s okay . wilson . what &apos;s first ?
jo . josephine .
not your name .
what patient is first ?
right . dr. bailey needs a consult .
dr. bailey .
this is robbie mccutcheon , 22,
no medical history or cardiac risk factors .
robbie is currently trying to pass
a pretty impressive kidney stone .
hi , robbie . i &apos;m dr. pierce .
oh , you hang in there , robbie .
he &apos;s scheduled for a percutaneous nephrolithotomy
to remove the stone .
too big to pass on his own ?
i had a child once .
i &apos;d rather have four more than do what he &apos;s trying to do .
hang in there , robbie .
robbie &apos;s been having fairly sustained runs of v @-@ tach .
dr. bailey ordered a cardiac panel and a stat ekg .
robbie , is the pain just in your stomach ,
or does your chest hurt , too ?
chest .
get me 80 milligrams i.v. sotalol and 6 of morphine .
yes , doctor .
robbie , i &apos;m
going to need you to take some deep breaths .
it hurts .
i know .
bundle branch block re @-@ entrant v @-@ tach .
he &apos;s at risk for sudden cardio attack ?
breathe , robbie .
just relax .
good .
okay , you got a normal sinus rhythm .
he &apos;s at risk for even minor surgery .
you &apos;ll have to postpone until i can do a full work @-@ up .
he &apos;ll need an echo . who &apos;s next ?
rita , eric .
all settled in ?
getting there .
hit it , milton .
wilson .
god . sorry .
rita choudry , 35 , 33 weeks pregnant ,
admitted for low sats and bed rest .
forever .
really ? i have to be here until this baby comes out ?
yes , you do . tell me why .
rita suffers from ebstein &apos;s malformation .
which is ?
a congenital malformation of the tricuspid valve .
excuse me , dr. pierce . do you mind if we play through ?
absolutely . you have a patient here , too .
baby girl choudry , e.d.d. six weeks .
she suffers from double inlet left ventricle ,
which will require immediate heart surgery when she &apos;s born
and fetal monitoring until then ,
which is why we &apos;ve admitted her mom .
and also because --
i know . i know . because the strain of childbirth
might cause my crappy heart to poop out .
i just need to be sure you know the risks .
and the risks are having this baby could kill me .
please stop saying it .
i &apos;ve heard it , and i refuse to believe it , right , hon ?
yep .
well , get settled , relax .
you &apos;ll be seeing way too much of us .
her chances are that bad ?
there &apos;s a good possibility
she &apos;ll die trying to have this baby .
she was strongly advised against it .
then why take the case ?
because she decided to have it anyway .
and i like my chances better than hers .
that sounds braggy .
no , it sounds badass .
what &apos;s next ?
marjorie reed , 88 , stage iv small cell cancer of the lung
with mets to the liver .
marjorie , how you doing now ?
she says her stomach hurts ,
but i think she &apos;s doing better , thanks to you .
thank you again .
mom ! i &apos;m gonna go get some tea !
i &apos;ll be right back , okay ?
you gave us a big scare this morning .
no more of that , okay ?
that happens again , i want to die .
oh , please , please , let me die .
marjorie , do you know where you are ?
do you know ... - you think --
you ask me if i &apos;m out of my mind ?
i &apos;m -- i wouldn &apos;t say ...
yes .
i &apos;ve lived 88 years , 65 of them with my husband .
more with him than without .
we taught english in japan for a while .
looks like here , japan .
so green .
we taught english .
did i say that ?
yes , you did .
oh . now i live in this ugly room
with these ugly machines , alone .
ohh . oh . but hurting constantly .
uh , these drugs you give me make me forget .
i &apos;m forgetting my life .
it was beautiful , my life .
i earned a better end than this .
there are forms you can sign .
oh . jeannie won &apos;t let me .
she &apos;d never forgive herself
if she didn &apos;t do everything she could .
bless her heart , but she &apos;s scared .
always has been .
where she gets it , i have no idea .
and ... am i out of my mind ? no .
but when it &apos;s my time ,
i should get to die remembering my life .
shouldn &apos;t i ?
i don &apos;t understand . can &apos;t we override the daughter ?
she has power of attorney and the mother won &apos;t do it .
and unless she has a signed dnr , we are legally required to do --
to do everything we can to save her .
even though i almost killed her this morning
trying to do it .
then talk to the daughter .
it &apos;s trickier than that .
she &apos;s better , right ?
she seems better .
jeannie , i &apos;m afraid she &apos;s not .
your mother &apos;s cancer has progressed
beyond what we can hope to treat or cure .
but she survived this morning and --
she is in incredible pain ,
and the process of resuscitation is so hard on her .
if it happens again -- - what ? what is she saying ?
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s only a matter of time now ,
and your mother deserve -
is she saying i should let her die ?
no ! you &apos;re her doctor .
you do whatever you have to do to keep her alive ,
to save her , right ?
you &apos;re her doctors , right ?
of course .
you don &apos;t speak to a patient unless i tell you to ,
is that understood ?
i was just trying to help --
you don &apos;t counsel a patient &apos;s family
on patient care , understood ?
i got it .
now you &apos;ve made that woman think
that we are pushing for her mother to die .
i got it . i &apos;m sorry .
okay .
i just had to bring the thunder .
bring the thunder ?
when you seem really nice or young or pretty ,
sometimes people don &apos;t take you seriously .
you have to help them understand who they &apos;re dealing with .
you have to bring the thunder .
if you don &apos;t do this , you should .
you &apos;re really pretty . what &apos;s next ?
robbie mccutcheon &apos;s cardiac echo came back .
well , that sucks .
what sucks ?
robbie has dilated cardiomyopathy .
should get cardiac anesthesia involved before you operate .
oh , hang in there .
we &apos;re gonna have to before that boy
tries to push a pencil eraser through his ... pin hole .
if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;d like to send out for robbie &apos;s full exome panel .
just out of curiosity .
you want to know if his cardiomyopathy is genetic ?
it &apos;s a little project i &apos;m working on .
i can run it for you .
you have a genome lab here ?
we did . the board just voted --
we do , and i still have a set of keys .
and if the board has a problem with that ,
you have them come talk to me ,
and i &apos;ll tell them what hole they can push that through !
was she bringing the thunder or did we just piss her off ?
dr. bailey doesn &apos;t need to bring anything .
she is the thunder .
the board just voted to shut down her genome lab ,
then they promised her a seat on the board ,
but she &apos;s probably gonna lose it to another surgeon .
wow . rightfully pissed .
well , there &apos;s two sides to every
what &apos;s next ?
uh , rita choudry &apos;s complaining of back pain .
who is dr. karev ?
why ?
he &apos;s paging me for a consult .
oh , that &apos;s the guy that &apos;s gonna take bailey &apos;s board seat .
uh , you saw me talking to him this morning .
he &apos;s in private practice ,
but he &apos;s gonna be appointed to the board ,
so he &apos;ll be coming back .
okay . first rita ,
then dr. karev .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve had a lot of lower back pain
throughout this whole pregnancy ,
but this is different .
it &apos;s high in the center and it burns .
all right , rita .
dr ...
wilson .
sorry . it &apos;s weird . i &apos;m really good with names .
really ?
dr. wilson is gonna take you for a c.t.
okay ? is there -- - is there something wrong ?
not necessarily .
back pain can mean a lot of things .
could just mean you &apos;re pregnant .
this kid &apos;s had persistent hypoxia and occasional pvcs .
could you check his cardiac function ?
we &apos;ll just take a look .
who are you ?
how is it you and i haven &apos;t met yet ?
i &apos;ve been here less than a month .
maggie pierce , new head of cardio .
well , don &apos;t be afraid to dance , maggie .
oh , i &apos;m not afraid . i &apos;m just not going to .
people are great here -- really fun .
right , karev ?
karev worked here .
i know .
and i hear congratulations are in order .
the board ?
what &apos;s that ?
nothing .
i said i hear congratulations are in order !
no .
for what ?
i hear you &apos;ve been appointed to our board .
well , that &apos;s not really -- it &apos;s , uh ...
stop the music .
something you want to tell me ?
was that ...
i was gonna talk to you at the right time .
are you quitting my practice ?
no , i &apos;ve just been offered a --
are you quitting my practice ?
i ... might be .
i chose you !
i selected you to have the keys
to the premier imperforate @-@ anus practice in the nation ,
and you take another job behind my back ?
i was gonna talk --
um ... you are not quitting my practice .
i am firing you from my practice .
i &apos;m not seeing any cardiac abnormalities , so ...
and i am gonna tell your tale of disloyalty
far and wide , my friend .
i will make sure that everybody knows
that you &apos;re as deceitful as you are stupid .
i will just gonna go .
watson .
that is not my name .
you were indiscreet and stupid , and you are off my service .
wait , what ?
karev &apos;s your boyfriend , right ?
i &apos;ve been --
yeah , he is . i could tell .
but you just met me and apparently felt it appropriate
to casually share confidential information
about your boyfriend &apos;s career
and then fail to tell me it was confidential ,
so i just used it to make small talk .
and now i don &apos;t ever need to learn your name
because you are off my service .
is this you bringing more thunder ?
no , no , no , this is me being pissed .
because i can &apos;t trust you .
go swap with a resident i can trust .
and you just got your boyfriend fired .
dr. pierce , did you ask
for all of dr. yang &apos;s chart on the mcneil family ?
i did link mcneil &apos;s transplant the day yang left .
i know . i just wondered why you needed access
to the rest of the family &apos;s .
i mean , three kids in one family with cardiomyopathy ?
it just bugged me why no one found out why .
hmm . it bugged us , too .
dr. yang ran every imaginable test ,
including a full exome panel .
now , you really think you could find something that she didn &apos;t ?
do you think that &apos;s impossible ?
i think in most cases , this disease is idiopathic ,
and its cause remains a mystery .
i think the mcneil have been through
a year of hell .
unless you have something new to tell them ,
they &apos;re gonna build up their hopes for nothing .
i think we should leave them alone to heal .
yes , sir .
thank you .
hello .
who are you ?
zola , sweetie . zola , sweetie . come on over here .
come and sit down right here . dr. pierce , right ?
dr. shepherd . nice to meet you .
you &apos;ve met dr. grey .
yes . hi .
we &apos;ve met .
who is this ?
uh , this is our daughter , zola .
hi , zola . i &apos;m maggie .
i hear you &apos;re going to run the new brain @-@ mapping initiative
at the n.i.h.
that &apos;s very exciting .
uh , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not .
oh . i &apos;m sorry . i was misinformed .
i &apos;m really killing it today .
we have two children . their lives are here .
being away from my family is -- uh , it &apos;s untenable for me .
i totally understand .
my family &apos;s back in boston . it &apos;s very hard being away .
isn &apos;t that gonna get cold ?
would you like to join us ?
i &apos;m gonna -- i have to talk to dr. webber .
nice to meet you both .
this big secret
is why you ended up at a meeting in the first place .
look , i
may i join you ?
amelia shepherd ,
do you know dr. maggie pierce ?
weird ,
you &apos;re the second dr. shepherd i &apos;ve met today .
derek is my brother .
i &apos;m sorry . is everyone in this room somehow related ?
i &apos;m gonna leave you two alone . nice meeting you .
meredith grey has an adopted daughter .
uh , i @-@ i know this .
well , i didn &apos;t .
zola came to them as a patient
through the african exchange program .
spina bifida . and they adopted her .
oh , my god , just stop .
i &apos;m sorry ?
it &apos;s easier when she &apos;s just a rude bitchy person
i don &apos;t care to know , but she keeps getting .
she adopted a beautiful ,
surgically needy african orphan .
it &apos;s annoying .
should i talk to her ? what do you think ?
honestly .
i think she &apos;s more than you bargained for .
but i think when the world
gives you more than you bargain for ...
you usually end up glad you got it .
you &apos;re staring .
isn &apos;t it funny ?
she adopts a kid , her mother gives one up .
you have no idea what the story was there ?
i never knew anything about it .
i do know this --
based on what i know about ellis ,
leaving you would have been
the most difficult decision of her life .
how well did you know her ?
dr. pierce , bad news .
you &apos;re off my service .
i know , just look though .
oh , god . let me find dr. robbins .
i &apos;ll go talk to them .
okay .
the fellowship committee wants an answer tonight ?
sorry , dr. robbins ?
one minute , okay ?
listen , i am -- i &apos;m surprised that you &apos;re surprised by this .
i mean , it &apos;s a natural extension of what i already do .
i &apos;m surprised because it came out of the blue .
no , i thought about it for awhile .
i mean , i need something new .
we &apos;re having another kid . that &apos;s not new ?
this is different . it has nothing to do with that .
it does , though . i have research .
with you at work and then the fellowship ,
how do we have time for a new baby ? how ?
well , you know what ? i haven &apos;t said yes yet .
but you &apos;re going to .
listen to me . i haven &apos;t made up my mind .
oh , see , i thought you had .
i thought we were having a kid .
i &apos;m sorry .
about what ?
i wasn &apos;t listening .
you &apos;re nice and full of crap .
how &apos;s it going ?
not good .
you &apos;re having an aortic dissection .
there &apos;s a tear in the inner wall of your aorta
that causes blood to force the vessel apart .
oh , god , i knew it .
what about the baby ?
the baby needs to come out .
an o.b. will do an emergency c @-@ section ,
and then dr. pierce will prepare the dissection .
but isn &apos;t she too little ? can she handle the surgery ?
we don &apos;t have a choice .
if i don &apos;t operate , you &apos;ll die .
just make sure that my baby is --
rita , please ! please stop talking about the baby !
i told you not to do this !
i knew something like this would happen !
eric ?
eric !
step outside . please .
i &apos;m gonna call up and let them know we &apos;re coming .
okay ?
edwards , wetton , get her ready to move .
i know this is scary , but it &apos;s happening .
and the only thing she needs right now is your support .
i can &apos;t do it anymore . i can &apos;t support her killing herself !
she doesn &apos;t want to lose a child .
we already lost our child .
five years ago . madeleine . she was 2 .
they were walking down a sidewalk .
maddie wanted to run .
rita let go of her hand so she could run .
maddie tripped , she hit her head , and she was gone .
four feet away from her mother .
just a freak thing , you know ?
but rita will always believe
it &apos;s because she let go of her hand .
i &apos;m sorry .
and then when rita got her diagnosis ,
i never thought we &apos;d have another child .
we knew with her heart what it would do to her .
and when she got pregnant , it was an accident .
and i begged .
i begged her not to have the baby , but she just --
she wouldn &apos;t let it go .
yeah , now i &apos;m gonna lose them both .
eric , nobody wants it this way ,
least of all rita .
she made a hard choice for the sake of the baby .
we just need to have the faith that she has .
okay , they &apos;re ready for us .
we &apos;re gonna do our best for her , okay ?
how do you feel ?
i wish she could have cooked it a little longer .
how do you feel ?
i wish i was anywhere else .
good luck .
you , too .
how &apos;s that baby doing ?
baby &apos;s cyanotic and apneic . dr. robbins ?
let &apos;s get to work on rita .
we need to get the baby &apos;s airway cleared .
let &apos;s get her breathing and get her to the o.r.
you ready ?
okay , she &apos;s breathing . she &apos;s ready to move .
robbins , keep me posted .
i will .
scalpel .
dacron graft and 4 @-@ 0 prolene , please .
damn it . damn it . it &apos;s tearing more .
pledget .
when we &apos;re done here , i &apos;d like you to remember that you are --
off your service . i know .
you want me to leave now , i &apos;ll leave now .
another pledget .
all right . let &apos;s see if this heart will start .
internal paddles , please .
any update from robbins ? how &apos;s the baby ?
dr. robbins can &apos;t talk .
that can &apos;t be good .
okay , charge to 10 , please .
all right , everybody , cross your fingers , pray ,
do whatever you do .
and ... clear .
again ?
wait .
we have sinus .
thanks , everybody .
i got to go check on that baby . can you close ?
can i close ?
you &apos;re a third @-@ year resident .
can you close a midline sternotomy ?
can i trust you to do that ?
yes .
yes , absolutely i can .
she &apos;s flatline .
suction . i can &apos;t even see the field .
come on . come on .
what happened ?
i &apos;m losing her .
there &apos;s a solution . we &apos;ll find it . talk me through it .
i was banding the pulmonary
artery together when it perfed through her vessels .
okay , can you try a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt ?
it won &apos;t help . they &apos;re both too small --
to take the pulmonary pressure .
it &apos;s not in her vessels . it &apos;s something else .
it &apos;s the ventricle . i can do a septation .
separate her one good ventricle ...
into two ventricles .
septation has a pretty high mortality rate .
well , she currently has zero chance of survival .
so this is better .
this is better . let &apos;s start bypass .
push heparin and get me my loops .
nurses &apos; station .
how &apos;s rita choudry ?
good . easy closure . she &apos;s in post @-@ op .
you can check my work .
how &apos;s the baby ?
it got complicated .
i &apos;m going to the e.r. for a consult .
i &apos;ll come with you .
you can go home . you &apos;re off my service .
see , i wanted to talk to you about that .
hey , it &apos;s dr. blabbermouth .
dr. karev , i am sorry --
next time , maybe don &apos;t speak up till you know what you &apos;re talking about .
look , it &apos;s my fault .
i sent her in there with half the story .
it &apos;s me you should be pissed at .
okay , well , now i &apos;m pissed at you .
sorry . i didn &apos;t know she was gonna say anything .
why did you even tell her in the first place ?
alex , i said -- - now i got no job .
dr. shepherd , i was called for a cardio consult .
was that you or the other dr. shepherd ?
i love you .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry -- no one has ever called my brother
&quot; the other dr. shepherd . &quot; it &apos;s beautiful .
i called you . over here .
this is tracey , early 20s ,
possible minor ischemic stroke .
a @-@ a stroke ? i gave her a stroke ?
after sexual activity .
tracey , could you squeeze my fingers ?
really hard .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ve got you .
just relax .
any more history ?
we don &apos;t have a last name .
we just met , like , an hour ago at the gym .
we went to my place .
what ? we hit it off .
like gangbusters .
sorry , but was this sexual activity pretty vigorous ?
it was really good . at one point , we were --
that &apos;s all i need .
and then it was over ,
and -- and -- and she went all wonky like this .
do people get strokes from sex ?
almost never .
so , was it just ... me ?
what answer are you hoping for ?
did she say if she was on the pill ?
we used a condom . i &apos;m not stupid .
i &apos;m looking for possible risk factors for stroke .
birth @-@ control pills can increase the risk of blood clots .
there was no i.d. ?
oh , i couldn &apos;t find her purse .
tracey , can you tell us your last name ?
re @-@ re--
regger ? roger ?
yeah , i did this for 10 minutes , guys .
she was at the gym . did she have headphones ?
uh , yeah . this is hers .
she &apos;d have to register that thing to put music on it .
get a serial number , call the company ,
get a name , and get a history .
on it .
nice one , sherlock .
i &apos;ll get an echo and some chest films .
okay , meantime , let &apos;s get a head c.t.
and a bilateral carotid artery doppler .
what the hell is she doing ?
marjorie got hypotensive . grey was here .
she decided to put in a central line to give her pressors .
dr. pierce , dr. bailey told me
you ordered an exome panel for her patient .
they caught me . and i threw you under the bus . sorry .
yeah , dr. bailey &apos;s genome @-@ research program
has been discontinued .
you know , i heard that .
and i have to say , i think it &apos;s stupid .
genome mapping is like getting the answers in the back of the book .
it is the key to so many medical solutions .
closing that program makes your board look like a bunch of morons .
have you met dr. avery ?
yeah , plastics , right ?
dr. avery is also a voting member on the board .
of course you are .
yeah , i like her .
you put a central line in my patient
without notifying me first .
there wasn &apos;t time .
there was time to ask a nurse to tell me .
doesn &apos;t work like that here , pierce .
i don &apos;t need your permission to keep her from dying .
she &apos;s right , dr. pierce .
damn it .
listen , i get that i &apos;m new .
i get that you don &apos;t know me ,
but i &apos;m gonna demand that you listen to me .
like it or not , i am the chief of cardiothoracic surgery .
you can &apos;t even look at me when i &apos;m talking to you .
dr. margaret pierce ?
* we &apos;re so proud , we &apos;ll shout it loud *
* cause we &apos;ve no doubt that you &apos;ll be *
* doing great as chief of cardiothoracic surgery *
* maggie , we are so impressed . you &apos;re our favorite surgeon . *
* we send you our best wishes fro @-@ o @-@ o @-@ m *
it &apos;s a gift .
* this giant singing sturgeon . *
from my parents .
* we love you , maggi @-@ e @-@ e @-@ e @-@ e @-@ e . *
it was -- no , it was hilarious .
everyone thought it was hilarious .
the timing could have been better .
it was incredibly cheesy , and i loved it .
it was perfect , thank you .
nothing , i &apos;m just ...
i just miss you guys .
no , nothing happened , mom . i just ...
i think it might have been a mistake
coming here .
i don &apos;t feel like i can be myself .
dad , don &apos;t start crying .
i got to go .
so , tracey &apos;s coming around .
she was lucky -- minor stroke .
nerve responses returning , no signs of deficits ,
but we still don &apos;t know
what caused it , right ?
uh @-@ huh. no signs of cardiovascular disease ,
no signs of carotid disease .
so i thought ...
are you listening ?
sorry .
i was thinking i have had good sex ,
but i &apos;ve never had put @-@ you @-@ in @-@ the @-@ hospital sex .
i feel like i &apos;m missing out .
so , i was thinking , could pthe clot be coming from some --
i mean , i don &apos;t want a stroke , but i &apos;d like to get close .
the clot could have come from someplace else .
guess that &apos;s what you call one mind @-@ blowing orgasm .
are you done ?
i have one more .
he nearly screwed her brains out . i &apos;m done .
and i found one in her leg .
i have not had sex in a long time .
you &apos;re preaching to the choir , sister .
the clot in her left leg
meant there must be a hole in her heart .
through which the clot in her leg ,
with help from pressure changes during very good sex ,
traveled from the right to the left chamber of her heart ,
on up to her brain .
now i just have to plug the hole like ... this .
nice catch , doctor .
or should i say ... * chief of cardiothoracic surgery *
oh , dear god . you heard .
your parents sound like very sweet people .
they are .
they &apos;re very sweet and very funny
and nothing at all like me .
no understanding of what i do or why i like doing it .
oh , i know that feeling .
i always felt like the odd man out .
i have three sisters and a brother .
they are all very put together , and i ... kind of a mess .
it wasn &apos;t until i met meredith
i had a sister i could relate to .
really ?
not at first. you know ?
she &apos;s ... hard to get to know ,
but she &apos;s worth knowing .
really .
dr.pierce.
dr. bailey
you are not on
on your service. yes .
dr. bailey asked to see you when you &apos;re finished .
i apprehended the culprit .
raf1 mutation right there .
that little orange bastard caused robbie &apos;s cardiomyopathy .
raf1 . since when ?
well , it was just isolated
a month ago by a doctor in australia ,
and the screening panel was updated last week .
so , until a week ago .
we didn &apos;t know what caused cardiomyopathy .
is this what you wanted ?
yes !
genetic profiling is a rapidly growing science .
new findings crop up every single day .
for example , three months ago ,
there were only 33 known genetic causes for cardiomyopathy .
today , there are 34 .
this right here -- this is the genetic mutation
that gave your kids cardiomyopathy .
that &apos;s what made our kids sick ?
yes .
there &apos;s ... so it isn &apos;t our house .
it isn &apos;t the water .
it isn &apos;t anything , uh , we did .
it wasn &apos;t me .
no , sabine , it wasn &apos;t you . sabine .
everything that you have done
has made your kids healthier and safer .
you did everything you could .
dr. yang did everything she could .
no one could have known about this .
okay .
why -- why did you keep looking ?
i just ... when i find a puzzle ,
it &apos;s very hard for me to put it down .
son of a bitch . i &apos;m sorry . i - i got to go .
thank you .
thank you so much .
i need that crash cart in here !
wait. wait . wait , wait .
wait for what ?
get off .
i got it ! i got her !
you got to go harder than that , pierce .
she &apos;s my patient . i know what she can take .
okay , let me in . i have to shock her .
i have this .
pierce , you &apos;re not helping her .
dr. grey , she can &apos;t take the defibrillation .
i got this .
marjorie .
you &apos;re all right . you &apos;re okay .
i &apos;m here with you . it &apos;s okay .
pierce , you &apos;re letting her die .
pierce .
you &apos;re okay .
pierce !
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re okay .
time of death .
time of death , dr. grey .
nurse , what is the time ?
20 : 42 .
time of death , 20 : 42 .
pierce .
pierce . pierce , hold up .
chief .
i just wanted to say thank you
for what you did for the mcneils .
you gave them ... some peace .
and i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here , so ... thank you .
you and yang did all the hard work .
i just got to bring it over the finish line .
chief .
i think you should know
that dr. pierce just slow @-@ coded a patient right in front of me .
what ? grey , that is a --
i watched it happen .
she deliberately withheld care from a coding patient .
her cpr was totally ineffectual
and she would not let me defibrillate .
slow down .
dr. grey .
you let that woman die .
grey , slow down ! pierce .
dr. grey has been doubting my effectiveness
and undermining my authority since the minute i got here .
maybe i &apos;m being judged too harshly against my predecessor
or maybe she just doesn &apos;t like me ,
but i can only say to her
what i will say to my patient &apos;s family --
i did everything in my power as a physician to help her ,
but i am sorry to say she &apos;s gone .
are we finished , chief ?
for now .
grey , wait .
if you want to get me fired , go ahead . i don &apos;t care .
if you want to tell that woman what i did , fine .
but tell her the whole truth .
her mother begged me in no uncertain terms
to end her suffering naturally .
she would have signed papers to that effect ,
but her daughter wouldn &apos;t allow her to .
her daughter was too scared to realize
that she was keeping her alive and in agony .
i did what my patient and i decided was in her best interest .
you look me in the eye
and tell me you wouldn &apos;t have done the same thing .
is she all right , my mother ?
i went for dinner and some errands , but when i came --
jeannie . i &apos;m sorry .
your mother &apos;s heart stopped again , and i ...
i --
dr. pierce did everything in her power .
despite all our efforts and capabilities ,
we weren &apos;t able to save your mother .
i am very sorry for your loss .
i &apos;m saying that i think you &apos;re right .
you know , maybe this is something that i can give up
so that we can have , you know --
how &apos;s she doing ?
oh , um , no signs of cyanosis or congestive heart failure .
so far , so good .
nice work .
you , too .
you should go see her .
thank you , doctor .
so ?
so , i &apos;m gonna pass on the fellowship .
no , you &apos;re not. you can &apos;t .
what ?
look , i was wrong this morning .
this isn &apos;t a sacrifice that you should have to make .
we can figure this out .
if it makes you happy , that will benefit our kid --
kids more than anything .
so , you think i should do it ?
i think you have to .
oh ! thank you .
goodnight , dr. robbins , dr. torres .
where -- where &apos;s the baby ? is the baby --
the baby &apos;s fine . she &apos;s beautiful .
thanks to you , she &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll let you know as soon as you can go see her .
looks like a full recovery ,
and we found her parents , sherlock .
they &apos;re on their way in from arizona .
can i ask you guys something ?
we just hooked up the one time ,
but i wanted to ask her out because she was really cool ,
you know , before she went all derp .
should i hang out till she wakes up ,
or does that make me look , like , clingy ?
um , that &apos;s ... sweet .
well ... i was once the girl
who went home with the guy she met an hour ago .
if this had been me ,
you would be the last person i &apos;d want to see .
okay .
yeah , maybe run into her at the gym .
maybe learn her last name . maybe invite her to dinner .
can i have your number ?
go .
go .
most puzzles come down to one last missing piece of information .
whether it &apos;s the answer to a medical mystery ...
pierce figured out what happened to the mcneil kids ?
that &apos;s surprising .
she solved it .
she did what yang couldn &apos;t do , and she hates me .
i finished your post @-@ ops . anything else ?
you don &apos;t take no for an answer .
so you &apos;re insubordinate , as well as everything else .
no .
no ?
no . i am not insubordinate or untrustworthy .
i think we got off to a bad start .
i made a mistake . i should have told you the whole story .
but i came here to learn ,
and i learned a crap ton from you today ,
so i decided i deserved a second chance ,
and you weren &apos;t gonna give me one , so i gave myself one .
... or to the question of who you are , where you fit ...
is this your thunder ?
all right , wilson .
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
you called me by my name .
i did .
you keep checking your watch .
did you write my name on your wrist ?
i did .
i appreciate the effort .
... it all comes down to that last piece .
grey , wait . can i talk to you ?
tomorrow . i &apos;m heading home .
there &apos;s something i should tell you .
you know what ? i &apos;ve heard enough .
it &apos;s fine. we &apos;re fine. you &apos;re fine .
my mother was ellis grey .
that &apos;s why the final piece of a jigsaw puzzle
is so satisfying to place .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
we -- this isn &apos;t fair to you .
and we got off to a bad start , but i &apos;m here to work .
and if i &apos;m gonna be here , i got to be who i am .
so i need you to know the whole story .
i was put up for adoption in boston .
in boston ?
yes .
and i was adopted by a very nice couple --
an amazing couple .
they are my parents , but my mother ... my mother --
i found out a year ago .
my mother is your mother , ellis grey .
unless , of course , the piece doesn &apos;t quite fit .
what do you want ?
what ?
what are you after here ?
i know it sounds like --
you &apos;re five years younger than me .
if my mother were pregnant , i would have known .
you &apos;re wrong .
just -- or you &apos;re lying .
what ? what ? just listen .
stay away from me .
that can make you wish
you &apos;d never opened the puzzle in the first place .
