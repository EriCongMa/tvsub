i &apos;m mad for you , diane .
roger &apos;s dating already ?
omg , i wonder if she &apos;s younger than him .
you hold on a second .
lorraine , how &apos;s my favorite client ?
i &apos;ve been on something of a hot streak at work .
i &apos;ve tapped into a rich vein of new clients --
recently divorced moms .
you might say i hit the single @-@ mother lode .
how about that master suite , huh ?
maybe if i had someone to share it with .
lorraine , you are a beautiful woman with a lot to offer .
should we make an offer ?
it &apos;s a great house , but i &apos;m just gonna be alone .
diane , you &apos;re not gonna be alone .
you &apos;re gonna get a loan .
sodas , snacks -- poker game &apos;s in the basement .
look , i need more sleep than you ,
and ever since they cut down that stupid prune tree ,
the sun has been right in my eyes every morning .
it &apos;s not a prune tree . they pruned the tree .
and i &apos;m not switching places with you ,
so you should just put your head at the other end of the bed .
uh , why ? so my feet get the pillow ?
and i &apos;m the dumb one .
diane , you have got to forget about him .
roger &apos;s cheyenne &apos;s problem now .
honey ...
you know what ?
you need to talk .
starbucks for a little go juice ?
what is up ?
i need to go into the office .
my dad wants me to close out the monthly .
what ?
monthly . never mind . go on .
i &apos;m stretched a little thin today , so i need you
to do the grocery shopping , check in on the kids ,
and maybe clean up those branches in the front yard .
done and done .
is that an expression ,
or did you really only remember two of the things i said ?
the second .
i &apos;ll leave you a message .
hello ?
phil .
sorry . call back .
i have bad news , jay .
joe was thrown out of the gymboree .
again ? what happened ?
he pushed mason . he made him cry .
the teacher said that we cannot go back .
that &apos;s ridiculous . mason &apos;s a big baby .
everybody there is a big baby .
but joe plays very rough .
and we know why . it &apos;s the curse .
not that i &apos;d ever want to discourage you from whispering ,
but that &apos;s not a thing .
there is a mark of the devil in my family .
my great @-@ great grandfather
was given the location of an emerald mine
in exchange for his soul .
there &apos;s , like , paperwork or something that proves this ?
and they say that the day of his daughter &apos;s wedding ,
a great bird came from the sky
and snatched him with his claws
and took him far , far away .
you &apos;re aware that a remarkable number of your stories end
with a family member being carried off by a giant bird .
i only know what i was told , jay .
i &apos;m just saying after the third time ,
we might think about moving the party inside .
okay , maybe it &apos;s not the curse ,
but you know that my family has a very dark side .
my cousin aurelio is a horse thief .
my uncle carlos fixed soccer games . my aunt --
did he teach them to pick the ball up
and throw it down the field ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s the only way you fix soccer .
manny escaped it , but i am not sure about joe .
gloria , this is about an uptight teacher .
and so what if joe &apos;s a little boisterous ?
whatever happened to letting kids be themselves ?
ready .
lose the hat .
i guess i &apos;m supposed to see &quot; sound of music &quot; in a regular hat .
nothing against &quot; sound of music , &quot;
but there &apos;s a lot of other things
we could do this afternoon .
you ever hear of &quot; death wish &quot; ?
oh , i love &quot; death wish . &quot;
manny , that &apos;s the charity where the sick kids go to ,
like , a concert with madonna
or to the super bowl with justin bieber , or they --
no , no , no , no , no .
it &apos;s a movie -- new york , &apos; 70s ,
charles bronson &apos;s a firm family man , and he ...
who &apos;s pushed to the limit
until one day he decides to fight back .
you &apos;ve seen it ?
it &apos;s called &quot; death wish . &quot;
i doubt it ends with him trading banter
in an apartment with marsha mason .
hey , fiance ?
hello , my intended .
that one sounds a little murdery .
you are my intended .
stop it . stop it !
so , while you &apos;re out ,
i &apos;m gonna review our flower options ,
and i have to say , so far , i &apos;m partial to floral and hardy ,
but i &apos;m gonna give one last look at florist gump .
you love a business with a clever name .
i do . guilty .
can i just say i love how this is going ?
mitchell and i agreed
that i would be in charge of the wedding
after the tragic news last week from the andys .
uh , not the mountain range . no .
our friends andrew and andrew --
they broke up .
the stress of planning a wedding was too much .
they were quibbling about ...
everything .
i mean , uh , which is why i &apos;m just happy
to stay out of his way .
yeah , i dream big . then i winnow down .
dream big . winnow down .
dream big .
okay , winnow down .
yep . stay out of my way . sorry .
daddy , where &apos;s larry ?
oh , well , you know how cats are , sweetie .
they &apos;re -- they &apos;re wanderers .
but i haven &apos;t seen him in days .
well , he &apos;ll be back , okay ?
trust daddy on this .
okay .
you know , i &apos;m starting to get worried
that larry might not come back .
oh , he &apos;s definitely dead .
what ? !
yeah , street meat or coyote chow .
we &apos;ll wait a couple weeks , and then we &apos;ll get a new larry .
uh , you &apos;re pretty nonchalant about our family pet dying .
and shouldn &apos;t we help our daughter process this loss ?
yes , we will , and she &apos;ll be fine .
and it &apos;s not nonchalant .
it &apos;s farm life . death is everywhere .
you just learn to not get too attached to anything .
oh , so , what , if i were to die ,
you would just wait a few weeks and then replace me ?
of course not .
where would i find another gay mitchell
with your exact markings ?
what &apos;s happening , big al ?
yeah , let &apos;s go ahead and veto that nickname .
hey , reuben taught me this cool trick .
close your eyes .
oh , my god ! what is wrong with you ?
you kissed a girl . now we &apos;re even .
just paying off a poker debt .
luke &apos;s creepy friend just kissed me .
ew . reuben ? that little weirdo ?
i &apos;m still here .
i &apos;m gonna go boil my mouth .
oh , hey , guys . game &apos;s downstairs .
this little game you dorks play ,
we talking milk money or heavy cream ?
a lot of fresh bar mitzvah money down there .
mind if i sit in ?
we kind of got a no @-@ girls policy .
is it a policy or just something that keeps happening ?
the second .
hey , honey .
i am so excited i can &apos;t stand it !
if you &apos;re gonna move your hands around like that ,
you need to put the phone down .
okay , okay , okay .
for cocktail hour ,
they &apos;re creating a running waterfall
onto which they &apos;re going to project
a hologram of us embracing .
but we &apos;re still winnowing , right ?
already winnowed .
i cut the angel costumes .
hard choices , mitchell .
okay , i got to go . i &apos;m so excited !
yeah , me too .
best thing about my relationship with cam ?
trust .
newsflash -- i can be an obsessive person .
in the past , i &apos;ve had trouble letting someone else
call the shots .
giving up control made me crazy .
that &apos;s what makes my life with cam so freeing .
i can turn over big things to him
and never give them a second thought .
out of sight , out of mind . bye @-@ bye .
phil .
this is --
oh ! oh , my god !
phil ?
phil ? !
yeah , i was just sitting there ,
and he basically molested me .
excuse me ?
she &apos;s talking about reuben .
who are you ? !
you boys better have money .
i am not doing this for free .
w @-@ w @-@ what &apos;s -- what &apos;s happening ?
oh , i hear you , joyce .
his time &apos;s important . your time isn &apos;t , right ?
let me buzz you back , superstar .
okay .
hey , honey .
branches are still in the front yard ,
i just took a rake to the face ,
reuben is getting really weird on alex ,
and haley &apos;s doing something for money in the basement .
it &apos;s all gonna be fine .
daddy &apos;s home , superstar .
no . don &apos;t call me that .
i &apos;m not one of your needy little divorces .
um , that is work .
is it ?
&apos;cause i kind of feel like part of you loves
being a hero to those women .
i &apos;m a helper of people .
hey , you knew what you signed up for
when you hitched your wagon to a realtor man .
honey , when i met you ,
you were a wedding deejay .
by the way , spinderfella ,
looks like you still need to hit the grocery store .
i think someone &apos;s feeling neglected .
yes , i deal with a lot of lonely women ,
but there &apos;s only one i &apos;m married to .
you &apos;re getting too involved , phil .
you are juggling these women ,
and you &apos;re not that good a juggler .
now you &apos;re just lashing out !
hey , come here .
i didn &apos;t tell jay ,
but sometimes joe even scares me .
lucky for me , there are professionals
that are trained to deal with such problems .
ay , thank you for coming , padre .
oh , of course , gloria .
and this must be fulgencio .
what a beautiful little boy .
he &apos;s such a sweet nature .
i can tell he &apos;s a gentle soul .
ah ! hey , fulgencio , no , no .
sorry , padre .
ay , that &apos;s why i called you , father .
i think he &apos;s bad .
there is evil in my family .
ah , gloria , he &apos;s just a little baby .
last week , his eyes got red ,
and the dog backed away .
he probably just had a cold .
all mothers worry .
look at him -- rosy cheeks , he &apos;s playing with his blocks .
the six again .
so , joe knocks one kid down , he &apos;s out .
all kids do that .
why do you think your whole building is made out of nerf ?
yeah , you see where he gets it from .
hey , listen , i &apos;m not afraid of you , miss debbie .
you &apos;re not the -- damn it .
sounds like someone needs a relaxing trip
to nazi @-@ occupied austria .
can &apos;t believe she hung up on me .
well , you were yelling at her .
standing up for yourself is not the same thing as , uh --
excuse me .
uh , come on , jay .
so no one ever taught you manners , huh ?
whatever , dude .
no , you bump into somebody , you apologize .
and since i &apos;m teaching you something here ,
here &apos;s a little class called &quot; intro to pants . &quot;
jay , stop !
get off me !
i go to school with those kids .
you know how embarrassing that was ?
manny .
no .
why do you always got to be like this --
judgmental , hot @-@ tempered , loud ?
these are a few of my least @-@ favorite things .
well , i can see that the house speaks to you , diane .
&quot; buy me . &quot;
not now , house .
ah , the open floor plan , the spacious kitchen .
i do love it .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s the office .
why don &apos;t you take one last look at the backyard ?
did someone say barbecue ?
&quot; i did . &quot;
lorraine , what is up ?
nothing . just kicking it at the office .
slow down , now .
tell phil what happened .
phil , can i go in the garage ?
make yourself at home , sister .
that was my sister who is visiting town
- and my office ,
which is where i am calling you from .
you called me .
i &apos;m worried about larry .
oh , honey , i know .
where is he ?
um , lily , there &apos;s probably something i should tell you .
larry &apos;s not coming back home .
why ? is he dead ?
nope . um , not dead .
larry , uh , met someone , fell in love ,
and he got married .
are they ever going to visit ?
i &apos;m afraid not because when cats get married ,
they have to move to , um , the forest ,
and so then they &apos;re not tempted by other cats in the city .
it &apos;s larry .
i know .
even people that you would never expect
have moments of weakness .
no , over there .
but where &apos;s his wife ?
hello , larry .
larry &apos;s back .
yeah , uh , well , you know what ?
i think they probably , uh , didn &apos;t work out ,
and they broke up .
people get married and then break up ?
what if that happens to you and daddy ?
oh , y @-@ you know what ? daddy made a mistake .
uh , larry and his wife didn &apos;t break up .
larry &apos;s wife ... died .
oh , no .
yeah .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re gonna give him the closure he needs
by throwing , um , a funeral
to celebrate the remarkable life of larry &apos;s wife .
it &apos;s gonna be great . you know what ?
we &apos;re gonna have music , we &apos;re gonna get a shoe box ...
... we &apos;re gonna have candles .
yes . hi , florist gump . it &apos;s me again .
it felt good to handle that crisis on my own .
in the past , i would have had to run to mitchell ,
but he &apos;s been trusting me more and more .
i &apos;m so proud of him .
he &apos;s really learned to let things go .
oh , no ! god , no , no , no !
what ?
it &apos;s a bloodbath down there .
we lost everything .
i thought you were good .
i always beat dylan .
come on . we need your help .
you &apos;re the best card player in this family .
what &apos;s in it for me ?
a chance to be a good sister .
pass .
reuben &apos;s been telling everyone
you slipped him the tongue .
move .
i thought cats had nine lives .
yeah , and they do ,
but larry &apos;s wife was older than he was ,
and she &apos;d been married eight times before .
like elizabeth taylor ?
oh , you remember our bedtime stories .
oh , dylan , thank you for coming on such short notice .
i just need you to dig a hole right over here .
thank you .
oh , no problem .
so , lily , i &apos;m really sorry .
how &apos;s larry doing ?
fine . he &apos;s a happy cat .
oh , they &apos;re cats .
that &apos;s gonna make my job a lot easier .
okay , everyone , thank you for coming .
it means a lot to lily , and it means a lot to me .
angus ?
so , larry &apos;s wife -- what can i say ?
she loved larry .
and , um , you know , like all cat marriages ,
they had their ups and their downs ,
but they always landed on their feet .
oh , hit a rock .
oh ! not a rock !
okay , everybody !
please stay calm ! please stay calm !
no running ! it &apos;s slippery !
angus , keep playing !
okay .
randall !
yeah ?
i &apos;m up here .
mr. pritchett ?
this is all intern work .
it isn &apos;t for my band .
need me to do a coffee run ?
no .
no , uh , listen , i was -- i was cleaning ,
and i got stuck up here ,
and i need you to go into my office
and stand up the ladder that fell .
got it .
and i &apos;m sorry about lying before .
those are flyers for my band ,
the interns .
uh @-@ oh . your door &apos;s locked .
oh , no .
but , hey , i @-@ i think , if you keep going forward ,
then back your legs out through the vent ,
i can grab them to help you down .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
that makes me a little nervous .
just think about something else .
i heard you &apos;re getting married . how &apos;s that going ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s good . it &apos;s good .
you know , we &apos;re planning it right now .
actually , it &apos;s being planned for me .
that &apos;s nice . no stress .
oh , you &apos;d think , huh ?
but it &apos;s getting a little bit out of hand .
oh , that happens with weddings .
does it ?
i mean , how many weddings have you been to
that have something called a dove cannon ?
you know , i think i should have a say
in something like that .
you need to let go , mr. pritchett .
i @-@ i can &apos;t .
i @-@ i wish i could , but i can &apos;t .
i just -- it &apos;s freaking me out .
no , i &apos;ve got you already .
okay .
yeah .
thank you .
you know , i &apos;m pretty good at reading people ,
and it sounds like you and your lady
really need to talk this out .
yeah , maybe you &apos;re right .
so i &apos;m gonna let you in on a little secret .
i &apos;m gay .
oh , my god .
does she know ?
got to save something for the wedding night , huh ?
okay .
riley , no ! buster , please sit !
dylan , help !
i can &apos;t !
these cats and dogs are fighting like -- oh !
okay , everybody , i &apos;m sorry .
this was supposed to be a small service ,
but i don &apos;t winnow down .
i overdo .
and if i let a simple fake cat funeral get out of hand ,
how am i supposed to plan an entire wedding ?
you &apos;re late .
okay , i need mitchell .
good news .
he just pulled up .
damn it .
okay , in . in , in .
yes . okay .
and , please , can somebody catch that thing ?
okay , all right , stay .
everyone just ...
hey ! how was the gym ?
i never made it .
listen , cam , i got to talk about something .
i do , too .
what would you think about being more involved with the wedding ?
that &apos;s what i wanted to talk about .
i would love to .
thank god .
you know , i just think we &apos;re -- we &apos;re better together .
&quot; better together . &quot; mm , i like that .
i cannot be in a house with snakes .
how bad is it ?
gonna need about an hour .
here you go .
i got you sno @-@ caps ,
&apos;cause , you know , at the end , they escape across the alps .
thanks for ruining it .
calm down . the movie &apos;s 50 years old .
making friends everywhere , aren &apos;t you ?
listen , you always say , &quot; express your feelings . &quot;
when i get mad , that &apos;s what i do .
hello ? yeah , i can talk .
my parents dragged me into this stupid movie .
go ahead , jay . feed him his phone .
you &apos;re telling me that doesn &apos;t bother you ?
i can &apos;t hear you . talk louder .
i &apos;m just saying ...
... if we give in to every impulse ,
we &apos;re no better than wild animals .
but if we push it down , it eats you alive .
not if you just let it go .
the chick from that crapfest &quot; mary poppins . &quot;
that &apos;s it .
a lot of cold , lonely nights in that apartment by myself
while my mom was driving a taxi ,
and only one thing kept me company .
so , you got a problem with poppins ,
you got a problem with me .
ay , father , i am so sorry .
i didn &apos;t even know that he could hold a fork .
no , no , no , i blame myself .
i probably shouldn &apos;t have taken his nose .
no , it &apos;s my family .
the girls are very chesty ,
but the men , they &apos;re kissed by the devil .
gloria , the fact that you are so concerned
is only proof that you are a loving and caring mother .
it &apos;s the parents who shape the child .
and your son is growing up in a wonderful home .
die , scum !
no , no , no !
louder , like you did
at the drive @-@ through .
mom , jay and i saw &quot; death wish . &quot;
amazing .
manny got in a fight at &quot; the sound of music , &quot;
got kicked out .
i &apos;ve never been so proud .
well , i guess every household
could use a little fine @-@ tuning , huh ?
let me give you my card
with my cell number on it .
please .
and what did i do with my wallet ? i ...
i had yelled at phil for not helping out ,
and there he was , doing exactly what i had asked him to do ...
here &apos;s our zucchini .
up top , buddy .
... for some other family .
you are so sweet for helping me with this .
how hurt you &apos;ve been , lorraine --
this is sweet . this is ... normal .
phil ?
diane ?
hey , superstar .
i thought i was superstar .
oh , your husband has been so wonderful to me .
he &apos;s not my husband . he &apos;s my realtor .
oh , he &apos;s my realtor .
i &apos;m both your realtors .
i @-@ i &apos;m just lucky to have such a --
we &apos;re on our way to an open house .
oh , is that why you couldn &apos;t
show me the colonial later ?
i made that corn bread that you like .
w @-@ we &apos;re gonna make it to that .
i just have to finish up with lorraine .
oh , you mean , like , &quot; get it over with &quot; ?
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t mean that .
and i thought zucchini bread was your favorite .
why -- why am i buying zucchini ?
hey , can &apos;t a guy like zucchini bread
and corn bread ?
phil ?
damn it .
ronnie !
i thought you had a doctor &apos;s appointment .
that &apos;s why you had to miss darrell &apos;s swim meet .
who &apos;s she ?
just another client .
&quot; just another client &quot; ?
no , that &apos;s -- what is this ?
uh @-@ oh , it is . it &apos;s my office .
got to take it .
hello ?
phil ?
claire ?
world &apos;s greatest realtor .
what are you doing here ?
your hair is sweating .
that &apos;s &apos; cause i &apos;m excited to see my friends .
let &apos;s go , buddy .
are you all clients of phil &apos;s ?
apparently .
well , you could not be in better hands .
i met phil when i was at such a rocky place in my life .
he was available to me morning , noon , and night .
of course he found me my dream house ,
but that wasn &apos;t the best part .
phil taught me how to trust a man again ,
and i think that was always his plan .
that was always my plan .
and it was not easy for me to trust a man
after the husband that i &apos;d had .
this guys left tools in the yard ,
let the kids run wild .
well , great to see you , claire .
he was always interrupting me .
and he wore the most ridiculous sleep @-@ mask thing .
oh , god , sounds like such a diva .
or he &apos;s photosensitive ,
which is a real condition .
never took my advice .
you know , that &apos;s the worst part .
he never -- he never said he was sorry just one time .
i would kill to have heard ,
&quot; claire , you were right . &quot;
she was right .
louder .
i do not love this side of you .
thanks for winning my computer back .
and getting me all my money . that was awesome .
yeah , if only i had stopped there ,
but i had to go back down .
i got greedy , and i was careless .
there &apos;s a story about that i remember from school .
icarus flew too close to his son .
i think their wings bumped .
one of them fell . they might have been ducks .
anyway , the lesson is , is that you have to pay attention .
or pay the ultimate price .
shall we , my dear ?
don &apos;t wait up .
