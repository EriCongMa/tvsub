vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power .
since then , werewolves can only turn on a full moon
and vampires are weakened by the sun .
the werewolf part of the curse is sealed with a moonstone .
he told me about your ex , katherine .
you must be elena .
how do we look exactly alike ?
the moonstone is what breaks the curse .
sacrifice is what breaks it . the blood of the doppelganger .
you &apos;re the doppelganger .
don &apos;t ! you need me . elena &apos;s in danger .
klaus is the real deal .
who is he ?
one of the first generation of vampires .
the oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me ?
luka .
i &apos;d like to introduce you to my dad .
jonas martin .
you &apos;re a witch ?
we prefer the term &quot; warlock . &quot;
elijah . one of the originals .
he &apos;s a legend .
you got in touch with elijah . how &apos;d you do it ?
a guy named slater , in richmond .
you can destroy the curse , but you need the moonstone .
he delivered his message .
it won &apos;t be long now .
elena .
i heard something .
that was us .
i &apos;m sorry .
we didn &apos;t think anyone was up ...
but here you are ...
we were just ...
chunky monkey ?
i didn &apos;t ... really hungry ... at all .
i &apos;m naked .
so i &apos;m gonna go .
i &apos;m really , really sorry .
it &apos;s ok , jenna , don &apos;t worry about it .
i know he &apos;s been staying over a lot .
are you-- are you sure it &apos;s ok ?
seems like things are good .
they &apos;re extremely good .
then i &apos;m extremely ok with it .
let &apos;s do it .
1 , 2 , 3 .
can we talk ?
why ?
we went to see katherine .
come on in .
please ...
come on in .
there &apos;s plenty of room for all of us .
i &apos;d rather poke my eyes out .
mmm , they &apos;re such pretty eyes .
we &apos;re here for the moonstone .
feel like tossing it over ?
tell you what .
you get your little witch to hocus pocus me out of here ,
you can have whatever you want .
i thought you liked it in here .
nice and safe , where klaus can &apos;t get to you .
i &apos;ve had time to reconsider .
meaning you &apos;re hungry .
i &apos;m starving , damon .
and dirty . but above all , i &apos;m bored .
at least running from klaus isn &apos;t boring .
so here &apos;s the deal ...
you get me out of here , you get the moonstone
and i &apos;ll disappear from mystic falls forever .
let me know what you decide .
you don &apos;t believe her , do you ?
no , of course not . we just want the moonstone .
according to rose &apos;s friend slater ,
there &apos;s a way to destroy the spell that klaus wants to break .
no spell , no doppelganger sacrifice .
ergo , you live .
how do you destroy it ?
by releasing it from the moonstone .
how do you guys even know this is gonna work ?
&apos;cause we have a crafty witch on our side .
you discussed it with bonnie .
she agreed to anything she could to help us .
it &apos;s katherine who has the moonstone .
she &apos;s not going to give it to you .
we &apos;re gonna get it from her .
well , what he means to say
is that we will pry it from her cold , dead hand if we have to .
bonnie just needs to find a way to release
the seal long enough for us to get in , get the moonstone and get out in time
for her to return it .
wow . i mean , it sounds like you guys already have it all planned out .
yep . we &apos;re awesome .
except for one thing .
i don &apos;t want you to do it .
what are you talking about ? elena , we don &apos;t have a choice .
what about klaus ?
we &apos;ll find him ,
but after we get the moonstone .
is that before or after he kills everyone that i care about ,
including the two of you ?
elena , if we can de @-@ spell the moonstone ,
we can save your life .
i know . everybody keeps saying that .
so your grams waited until you were in high school
to tell you that you &apos;re a witch ?
well , she brought it up before but i just thought she was drunk .
in my defense , she was .
so then , you &apos;re , like , new ?
new @-@ ish .
i still have some growing pains .
like ?
physically , it &apos;s become a lot harder .
i have a bad reaction to it sometimes .
your nose bleeds ?
yeah .
i pass out sometimes .
it &apos;s &apos; cause you &apos;re trying to do too much on your own .
you need help .
from what ?
from nature .
the elements .
just things that you can draw extra power from .
have you ever channeled another witch before ?
what is that ?
say we put our energy together .
we can double our strength .
i &apos;ll show you , watch .
let me see that bracelet .
take this .
now i want you to stand very still
and concentrate .
i don &apos;t get it .
ok . i know , it &apos;s , i ...
what are we doing ?
we &apos;re channeling .
the personal items will act as a talisman .
now concentrate .
what is that ?
pretty cool , huh ?
what &apos;s with that weather , huh ?
it &apos;s global warming , man .
i don &apos;t know .
i gotta go .
see ya later , bonnie .
bye , luka .
bye .
that guy is weird , huh ?
no , he &apos;s not .
what is it ?
it &apos;s damon .
it &apos;s not nice to leave a girl naked so early in the morning .
sorry , i thought you were ...
i , uh , sorry , i ...
there &apos;s no one else here .
actually , i came to talk to you .
then i should probably get dressed .
it &apos;s a bad idea .
no , it &apos;s not .
from what stefan told me ,
your friend slater obviously has more information about klaus .
and you and damon just gave up before you got it .
because somebody blew up a coffee shop with us in it .
there &apos;s more to learn .
we just have to find a way to learn it .
why are you coming to me with this ?
because you owe me .
one word from me , and damon and stefan
could have killed you for kidnapping me .
or maybe it &apos;s because you know that they wouldn &apos;t want you doing this .
and their moonstone caper gives you a chance to sneak away .
we &apos;re having a disagreement , okay ?
they &apos;re willing to risk everyone that i love , and i &apos;m not .
they &apos;re just trying to protect you .
and you &apos;ve proven that you can &apos;t care less whether i &apos;m protected or not .
so we &apos;re back to you taking me to slater .
what exactly do you have to achieve by this ?
how would you like to be able to walk during the daylight ?
i &apos;ve been a slave to shadows for 500 years .
what do you think ?
i think i know a witch who &apos;s willing to do whatever it takes to help ,
if you &apos;re willing to make a deal .
hey , man . how you doing ?
good , you ?
i &apos;m pissed at myself for picking a fight with you .
and feeling guilty for what happened to sarah .
i &apos;ve been dodging you for days
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t know what to say to you .
don &apos;t worry about it , man .
i &apos;m really sorry .
please know that .
matt .
hey .
how are you ?
i--i &apos;ve been better .
i gotta--
i gotta get to class .
ok .
are you two still on the outs ?
looks like it .
you realize there &apos;s almost a full moon ?
vampires don &apos;t have enough problems , you want to take on mine ?
have you even thought about it ?
the whole ... wolf thing ?
do you know what you &apos;re going to do ?
i have a plan .
well ?
it &apos;s kind of private .
i &apos;m student council vice president ,
head of the prom committee , not to mention
i single @-@ handedly organized this town &apos;s clean up campaign .
you &apos;re really going to turn down my help ?
i might be able to lower the tomb spell long enough for you to get in there
and grab the moonstone from katherine .
how ? it took both you and your grams last time ,
and look what happened to her .
i &apos;m well aware of what happened .
but i &apos;ve learned a few new things .
bonnie ...
how will you get it ?
she hasn &apos;t been feeding .
she &apos;s weaker .
we &apos;re not .
you wouldn &apos;t be underestimating her , would you ?
it &apos;s a plan .
is it perfect ?
what plan is ?
let me do it . i &apos;ve got my ring . i can get in , get out , no spells necessary .
thanks , you 16 @-@ year @-@ old child .
why didn &apos;t we think about that ?
why are you even here ?
maybe i can help better the plan .
do you have anything that belongs to katherine ?
slater !
slater , it &apos;s rose . open up .
he &apos;s not home . sorry .
no . we didn &apos;t come all the way out here for nothing .
after you .
slater ?
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s going to be much help .
it looks like whoever blew up the coffee shop
found him and killed him for his information .
yeah , probably to stop him from helping people like us .
the guy was a vampire almanac . knowing too much information
just bit him in the ass .
what are you
tempered glass .
u.v. rays can &apos;t penetrate .
i used to just come here and watch the day .
i &apos;m sorry about slater .
any luck ?
it &apos;s password protected , i can &apos;t get in .
no , this is fine . let &apos;s just go .
stay here .
alice ?
rose !
he &apos;s dead !
this belonged to katherine .
found it with her things after i thought she was dead ,
but it was hers .
what will this do ?
i can turn the metal to ash .
blow the ashes on her ,
and it &apos;ll incapacitate her for a minute or two .
long enough for you to get the stone and get out .
matt &apos;s bumming pretty hard .
i know .
it &apos;s better this way .
i get it .
you do ?
yeah .
you can &apos;t be honest with him .
and it &apos;s not really fair to be with someone
and not really let them know who you are .
i get it .
head over here .
there &apos;s a cellar that goes to our old property .
i know .
you do ?
i know that this is the old lockwood property .
watch your step .
i &apos;m guessing this is where mason was headed the night he turned .
it &apos;s this way .
did mason tell you about this place ?
mason bolted before i triggered the curse ,
but i found these .
they look old .
and these bolts and chains .
i need new chains , but the bolts could still hold .
i think that &apos;s what this place is used for .
for full moons .
what &apos;s this ?
i have no idea .
it was mason &apos;s .
&quot; august 31st--
my body is changing .
i &apos;m edgy , i &apos;m angry , impatient .
i get so mad , i black out and forget what i say or do .
i &apos;m not myself , not since jimmy &apos;s death .
what &apos;s happening to me ? &quot;
he chronicled everything .
full moon is tonight .
well , does he say what happened ?
better get the torches .
alaric &apos;s stake gun &apos;s in my trunk . bonnie ?
go ahead .
i &apos;m almost done .
what are you doing ?
hey , you &apos;re not strong enough .
i &apos;ll be fine .
you could get hurt .
and elena could die .
i &apos;ll be fine .
promise .
i promise .
here , i got this , ok ?
go get me , um , go get me something to put this in .
she found him a few minutes before we did .
how is she ?
overreacting . big time .
her boyfriend just died .
there &apos;s no such thing as overreacting .
those tears are for her .
she didn &apos;t care about slater .
she was only dating him
long enough to see if he &apos;d turn her .
thank you .
you look really familiar .
did you know slater ?
not personally , no .
i just knew that he kept detailed records of all of his vampire contacts ,
and i was hoping that he could point me towards klaus .
doubtful .
klaus doesn &apos;t want to be pointed out .
do you know slater &apos;s computer password ?
are you seriously asking me that right now ?
i just saw my boyfriend
with a stake through his heart .
i understand that .
do you know his password ?
who do you think you are ?
what if i could convince rose to turn you ?
will you show us his files then ?
someone &apos;s been here .
the hard drive &apos;s completely wiped out .
yeah , probably whoever killed him .
lucky for you , slater was paranoid .
everything &apos;s backed up on our remote server .
you know that she &apos;s not going anywhere near my blood , right ?
i know . she doesn &apos;t .
kristin stewart .
god , was he obvious .
these are all links to vampires ?
slater was obsessed , almost as much as me .
what about that one ? cody webber .
we exchanged dozens of emails about elijah .
i could call him .
tell him that we &apos;re trying to send a message to klaus .
the doppelganger is alive ,
and she &apos;s ready to surrender .
what ? !
oh , my god , i knew i recognized you .
get him the message , please .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m getting klaus &apos; attention .
if klaus knows that you &apos;re alive ,
he &apos;ll find you and he &apos;ll kill you .
which is exactly what you wanted all along .
it &apos;s either me or my family .
so this whole charade was a suicide mission
so that you could sacrifice yourself and save everyone else ?
cody is on his way .
and he really wants to meet you .
the youngest gilbert .
this is an intriguing surprise .
i &apos;m here for the moonstone .
yeah , yeah , the moonstone .
it &apos;s very popular today .
just give it to me .
leave , little gilbert .
if you want it , you &apos;re going to have to come here and get it .
i kinda figured you &apos;d say that .
where is it ?
sorry i &apos;m late . i had to grab the grimoire from home .
jeremy couldn &apos;t take the pressure , huh ?
he said he &apos;d be here .
not a good time , rose .
don &apos;t be angry with me .
why , what &apos;d you do ?
you need to get to richmond immediately .
tell me .
is that the moonstone ? !
i hate to interrupt ,
but today has just been full of surprises .
i &apos;m sorry .
i took some powder .
don &apos;t worry .
i know that he &apos;s wearing his ring ,
so no matter how many times i kill him , he &apos;ll just keep coming back for more .
so , i &apos;m going to be in the back playing with my new little toy .
you guys just give me a holler when you &apos;ve got the tomb open .
so how exactly does this spell work ?
give me your hand .
place it here .
now , take my hand .
close your eyes .
relax your mind .
and look for her .
you saw her , didn &apos;t you ?
i know exactly where she is .
where the hell is damon ?
we can &apos;t wait , we have to get him out of there .
if she &apos;s fed , she has her strength back .
we still have what &apos;s left of the ash .
do you think you can get close enough ?
i don &apos;t have a choice .
it &apos;s going to take me some time .
how long ?
i don &apos;t know , a while .
just get me in there as soon as you can .
so how was school ?
riveting .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
september 15th--
2 hours from the first full moon since i triggered the curse .
he taped his first transformation .
september 16th , he--
he wrote about everything the next day .
&quot; i chose the garage .
i could deadbolt the door .
it was far from the street so no one could hear .
i bolted hooks to the floor for the carabineers . &quot;
like for mountain climbing ?
retractable cables .
what &apos;s he doing ?
it &apos;s ... wolfsbane .
&quot; i diluted wolfsbane with water to weaken myself ,
but i could barely get it down without puking .
it felt like i was drinking battery acid . &quot;
hours passed and nothing happened .
it got so quiet , i could hear my own blood pumping .
that &apos;s when ...
i kept thinking i &apos;d black out and not feel it .
but i did . i ...
i felt all of it .
help ! has somebody ...
how long is it ?
we &apos;re 3 hours in .
4 hours .
5 hours .
how long does this last ?
i can &apos;t-- i can &apos;t do that .
caroline , whatever that was ,
i can &apos;t go through that .
what are you doing here ?
what are you doing here ?
you called him ?
i &apos;m sorry , elena .
you said that you understood .
she lied .
damon salvatore .
get rid of her .
no ... way .
come on . we &apos;re leaving .
no .
i said we &apos;re leaving .
i &apos;m not going with you .
you do not get to make decisions anymore .
when have i ever made a decision ?
you and stefan do that for me .
now this , this is my decision .
who &apos;s going to save your life while you &apos;re making decisions ?
you &apos;re not listening to me , damon .
i don &apos;t want to be saved .
not if it means that klaus is going to kill every single person that i love .
get your ass out the door before i throw you over my shoulder
and carry you out myself .
no .
don &apos;t ever do that again .
something &apos;s happening .
bonnie , no !
you have to stop her , she &apos;s not strong enough !
maybe she is .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s bonnie bennett .
she &apos;s channeling me .
why would you let her do that ?
you told me to bond with her , so i bonded .
my god .
bonnie , bonnie .
bonnie ... you gotta stop her !
ok , you need to stop . bonnie !
luka !
bonnie !
bonnie !
bonnie , wake up , please .
bonnie , wake up .
yes , please .
because i &apos;m still in here .
are you ok ? here .
are you all right ?
it didn &apos;t work .
i &apos;m not strong enough .
even with help , i can &apos;t do it .
ohh , that &apos;s too bad . i &apos;m still hungry .
go !
you know what ,
i don &apos;t think we should read this anymore .
why , what did you read ?
there &apos;s a ...
a reason it &apos;s called a &quot; curse , &quot; tyler .
&quot; unimaginable pain . &quot;
&quot; i thought it would never end . &quot;
&quot; it was the worst night of my life . &quot;
but ... he did say that the transformation
speeds up over time .
so if you can just get through this first time , then--
why are you helping me ?
what do you mean ?
why do you care ?
we &apos;ve never been friends before .
that &apos;s not true . i &apos;ve known you my entire life , tyler .
we &apos;ve never been close .
not like this .
i don &apos;t know .
you just seem like you ...
like you kinda need it .
i was alone when i turned .
i had no control over my body or ... my urges .
and ...
i killed somebody .
i don &apos;t want that to happen to you .
i don &apos;t want you to be alone .
i gotta ...
matt ...
i know i should have called . i &apos;m sorry .
what are you doing here ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i was driving home from work ,
and i just--i kinda found myself here .
well , are you ok ?
i--i &apos;ve been worried about you .
i miss you .
yeah .
matt , i ...
time to go .
alice is soundly sleeping ,
and won &apos;t remember a moment of this horribly stupid day .
we &apos;re here to meet the doppelganger .
thank you for coming .
i will break your arm .
there &apos;s nothing here for you .
i killed you . you were dead .
for centuries now .
who are you ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m elijah .
we were going to bring her to you .
for klaus . she &apos;s the doppelganger .
i don &apos;t know how she exists , but she does .
klaus would want to see her .
does anyone else know that you &apos;re here ?
no .
well , then , you have been incredibly helpful .
where &apos;s luka ?
asleep .
his shadow spell was successful .
i was able to track that girl .
however , i did have a little run in with one of the brothers that killed me .
i assume he didn &apos;t live to tell about it .
actually , i spared him .
he &apos;d die before he &apos;d let anything happen to her .
they both would .
she &apos;ll be kept safe .
for now .
well , that &apos;s precisely what we need her to be .
safe .
i &apos;m home , ok ?
i don &apos;t need an escort to my room .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
between here and upstairs , there &apos;s still time for you to do something stupid .
i already feel bad . i don &apos;t need you to berate me .
stefan is stuck in there ,
and i don &apos;t know how to get him out .
what should i be doing ?
you should admit that you never should have tried this in the first place .
i didn &apos;t have a choice , jeremy !
yeah , well , neither did i.
why did you have to get involved ?
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t want you to get hurt .
look , jeremy ,
you can &apos;t feel that way about me .
don &apos;t .
what ?
don &apos;t act like this is one @-@ sided . like ...
like i &apos;m some kid that has a crush on his sister &apos;s friend .
you could have died today .
and you almost did .
that was a chance i was willing to take .
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah .
thank you for bringing me home .
well , your ride left you .
didn &apos;t want to leave you stranded .
she was just scared . she didn &apos;t mean to run .
yes , she did .
she &apos;s been running for 500 years .
i can &apos;t believe elijah &apos;s alive .
why do you think he killed those 2 vampires and just let us go ?
if i had a dollar for every time some evil vampire surprised me .
what you did today was incredibly stupid .
actually , the only thing was stupid was that i got caught .
i don &apos;t question why you and stefan , everyone else
tries so hard to save me .
you shouldn &apos;t question why i would try to save all of you .
damon , good night , ok ?
what ?
it &apos;s stefan .
stefan .
stefan !
don &apos;t you dare .
stefan &apos;s in there , damon !
how could you let this happen ?
what are you talking about ? i was too busy saving you
from your crazy kamikaze mission .
you didn &apos;t even have to go after the moonstone in the first place .
it was the right call .
the right call ? how is any of this the right call ?
damon , let go of me .
damon , let go of me !
let go of me !
let go of me .
please .
are you done ?
of all the idiot plans , stefan .
i &apos;ll find a way to get you out .
no , that &apos;s all right .
i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll handle it myself .
bonnie has the moonstone .
work with her , try to figure out how to de @-@ spell it .
you martyr yourself into a tomb
and i get partnered with a semi @-@ competent witch .
wonderful .
promise me .
no matter what happens . you &apos;ll protect her .
promise .
