gossip girl here ...
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i spent 18 years
accepting the fact my mother was dead .
i want to know my son .
jack bass . chuck &apos;s uncle .
jack is the last person i would call for help .
i have feelings for you .
i don &apos;t want to ruin our friendship .
is that rufus &apos; scarf ?
miss holland say
rufus left this at her apartment .
please .
is there any way that damien can have visitation rights ?
i can &apos;t have you spending time
with someone mixed up with drugs .
from the day he brings his newborn girl home ,
a father lives in fear ...
that someday she &apos;ll get hurt ...
how about some breakfast ?
waffles . shocker .
no , i &apos;m good . thanks . i &apos;ll eat at school .
i &apos;ll see you at 4 : 15 , on the dot .
school , home , school , home . i get it . thanks .
that someday she &apos;ll hate him ...
hi . um , i need a car .
yeah , from d.u.m.b.o. to the smyth hotel .
okay , thanks . bye .
and worst of all ,
that someday she &apos;ll grow up .
chuck had an emergency meeting with his lawyer ,
but he hoped we could all meet up for some shopping later .
that sounds lovely .
this has been a wonderful week .
chuck thinks so , too .
he mentioned what a great squash player you were .
and he likes a woman who knows her way around a haberdashery .
actually ...
i think there &apos;s something he wants to ask you .
call when you &apos;re in the lobby .
are you okay ?
several female employees at the empire are suing me ...
for sexual harassment .
what ?
obviously there were incidents with room service at the palace ,
but that was my father &apos;s hotel . i was a kid .
i would never do that now ,
not in my hotel , not to you .
no . of course not .
they &apos;re scheming harlots
trying to get you to pay them off .
we have proof that two of those girls
weren &apos;t even in town on one of the alleged nights .
so we &apos;ll fight it .
we have innocence , good breeding
and doug jarrett , one of the best lawyers in new york ,
on our side . it &apos;s a slam dunk .
a court case would be a p.r. nightmare .
we have to settle .
you &apos;ll take care of it ?
settlements are for the guilty ...
celebrities who run people over ,
the catholic church . it &apos;s not fair .
the historical society is honoring my father tonight .
i can &apos;t have this overshadowing the evening
or anything else .
this way , the case will be sealed .
the press won &apos;t know . no one will .
elizabeth wouldn &apos;t have believed it , chuck .
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m doing this .
but if it was , i &apos;d understand .
you like her . you want the first time
she meets lily and the rest of your family to be perfect .
what is the point of having elizabeth in your life
if you &apos;re not going to let her in ?
not everyone &apos;s willing to wait 18 years for an &quot; i love you . &quot;
lily , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m just checking in .
how are things going with jenny ?
oh , we have an understanding ...
she goes to school , she comes home ... mm .
she does not date boys with bags of pills .
oh , i &apos;m sure she &apos;s furious .
the hulk was furious . there &apos;s no word for what jenny is .
rufus , i need to ask you something .
one sec , lil . headmistress queller , hi .
i see . thank you for calling .
jenny didn &apos;t go to school this morning .
apparently , she &apos;s been cutting classes all week .
who needs coffee after a wake @-@ up like that ?
who &apos;s texting this early ?
rufus .
he &apos;s freaking out . he can &apos;t find jenny .
he thinks she &apos;s with damien .
this is not good .
who , prince damien from the state dinner ?
i thought you thought he was dreamy .
well , that was before he tried to kiss me
after i told him not to .
um , what ?
and now that creep &apos;s with jenny ?
yeah . you know what &apos;s most attractive about a bad boy ?
no , i really don &apos;t .
your parents refusing to let you see him .
rufus is driving jenny right into damien &apos;s creepy arms .
i &apos;m not gonna let that happen .
your dad has called , like , five times .
he &apos;s obviously looking for you .
i know .
i &apos;m just not sure i want to explain where i &apos;ve been .
we agreed if this is gonna work ,
we gotta ... we gotta keep it casual .
if my dad knows , then it &apos;s suddenly gonna feel serious ,
and you know how bad i am at lying to him .
you can &apos;t avoid him forever .
hey , dad .
what ?
oh , um , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s 9 : 30 .
i have latin .
it &apos;s a dead language . it &apos;s not going anywhere .
why don &apos;t you just ditch it and stay here with me ?
i can &apos;t . i have a quiz .
come on , jenny .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a little coincidental
the last time we got to this exact same spot ...
you know , the place right underneath your kilt ...
that you had to go dissect a fetal pig ?
i did .
come on , damien . you know i want to be here .
jenny .
why don &apos;t we just talk about it ?
what &apos;s there to talk about ?
i think you &apos;re an amazing girl .
i love spending time with you .
but when i date someone , sex is usually part of the equation ,
and if you &apos;re not cool with that , it &apos;s fine ,
but you need to say something .
you can &apos;t just shut me down every time we &apos;re alone together .
i &apos;m not . i ... it &apos;s just not a good day .
i mean , i have a quiz , and then i have that other class .
you &apos;re younger than me . i get it .
could it be that you &apos;ve never ...
no . damien . it &apos;s not like that .
look , i just don &apos;t like the first time with someone to be rushed .
and i have school .
okay . well , how about tonight ?
after your father goes to sleep , we can sneak out .
no rush , okay ?
nice and slow .
yeah . perfect .
um , it &apos;s on , dalgaard .
i will see you tonight .
there &apos;s always a moment a father can &apos;t even let himself fear ...
the day his little j. decides to lose her big v.
i can &apos;t believe the fuss
they made over you at turnbull &amp; ssser .
i should hope so . prince william and i
practically put the manager &apos;s daughter through college .
well , i had a lovely time .
actually , there &apos;s something
that chuck has been meaning to ask you .
the historical society is
dedicating a gallery to bart tonight .
i understand it might be awkward for you
to go to an event where my father &apos;s being honored .
lily would be there and ...
i &apos;d love to come .
charles , this is why i &apos;m here .
i want to be as much a part of your life as you &apos;ll let me .
mr. bass ! mr. bass ,
did you pay off women you sexually harassed ?
did you receive sex in exchange for promotions ?
is it true ?
look , this is a lie . i &apos;ll explain later .
somebody must have leaked the story .
let &apos;s just go . let &apos;s go .
i should have guessed .
naughty nephew .
uncle jack .
you won &apos;t believe what i just heard .
i &apos;m shocked .
yeah , i &apos;m sure you are .
she &apos;s a teenage girl .
cutting school to be with her boyfriend
isn &apos;t exactly criminal behavior .
i guess i &apos;m still holding out hope
that somewhere underneath that mop of blond hair
is my little girl .
i know .
thanks for being here .
oh , i &apos;m glad i could be .
and i &apos;m willing to put the past in the past if you are .
rufus , we just need to talk .
now ?
well , the new york historical society
is dedicating a room to bart tonight .
i was hoping you could join me .
lil , i think this morning
has been a step in the right direction .
but i &apos;m not quite in the mood to celebrate
any of your former husbands right now .
i &apos;m gonna go try to get ahold of serena again .
hey , serena .
have you heard from her yet ?
thanks for texting me .
of course . parents can be such a pain .
see , if he wasn &apos;t so controlling and judgmental ,
then i wouldn &apos;t have to be sneaking around like this .
no , i @-@ i get it . you &apos;re 16 .
you should be able to date who you want .
exactly .
so how are things with damien ?
they &apos;re great .
um , he listens to me ,
and he ... he treats me like an adult
and really likes me .
i &apos;ve never felt this way before .
so it ... it &apos;s serious then ?
well , it &apos;s about to be .
he &apos;s , uh , staying at the smyth hotel ,
and i was thinking that tonight ...
tonight ?
uh , i &apos;d say that is serious then .
your first time ... that &apos;s ... that &apos;s monumental .
it is your first time , right ?
are you nervous ?
yeah , i guess a little .
jenny , the thing about your virginity
is that you can never get it back .
you know , i ...
i always kinda wish
i @-@ i would &apos;ve waited
for somebody that would have stood up for me
and fought for me ,
you know , like patrick swayze in &quot; dirty dancing . &quot;
&quot; dirty dancing &quot; ?
it &apos;s great . you should download it .
all right . but , see , the thing is , serena ,
that damien really is the right guy .
okay , well , that &apos;s your decision , and i &apos;ll support you .
uh , you know , obviously , you &apos;re not going to school today ,
and you should ... should commemorate today , so ...
i have to get ready for chuck &apos;s party ,
but nate will take you to lunch .
yeah . i , um , what are you in the mood for ?
there he is . i would have been here sooner ,
but i got distracted reading some of those protestors &apos; signs .
i never realized how many sex puns you could make
out of the name &quot; chuck bass . &quot;
don &apos;t worry .
it &apos;ll blow over in a couple weeks .
you expect me to believe it &apos;s just coincidence
you show up the same time this lawsuit does ?
i came back to protect you .
see , i heard a rumor ... evelyn bass rose from the dead .
oh , she wasn &apos;t dead .
no , it seems my father paid her
to stay away from me all these years .
yeah . i get why you &apos;d fall for all this ,
what , with your mommy issues ,
all those abnormal attachments to your babysitters .
didn &apos;t help that i was nailing &apos; em , huh ?
but , chuck , i saw evelyn &apos;s body
in the casket at the funeral home .
and why should i believe anything you say ?
i tell you what . have her come by the party tonight .
the old evelyn and i never got along .
maybe now we &apos;ll hit it off .
it might be fun .
i &apos;ve never seen a ghost before .
well , hello , gorgeous .
and now it all makes sense .
you &apos;re the blood @-@ sucking reptile behind this lawsuit .
wow . harsh words . but i &apos;m innocent .
whoever did this is more brilliant than i am .
my sources tell me
reservations are already down 20 % .
you &apos;re a lying ooze .
little nephew is going to have to step down
from his beloved empire .
and what ?
you think you &apos;ll somehow get it ?
please . that &apos;ll never happen .
blair .
i &apos;ve already had everything of chuck &apos;s worth having .
and as always , the pleasure is yours .
trust me . i have a plan .
telling jenny that damien is bad for her
will only make her want him more .
we have to show her .
and how ... how are we gonna do that ?
i called him and invited him over for lunch .
what , are you crazy ?
you said the last time you were alone with that guy ,
he tried to rip your clothes off .
and he &apos;ll try to again , but this time , you and jenny
are gonna walk in right in time to catch him .
this ... this sounds absurd .
blair and chuck do it all the time .
nate , i know it &apos;s not ideal ,
but jenny &apos;s gonna have sex
with him tonight if we don &apos;t stop this .
we should just call rufus .
what , so he can ground her again ?
nate , this is gonna work .
it &apos;s one o &apos;clock now , give me 45 minutes exactly .
bye .
i &apos;m so glad you called .
you know what , dad ? i think every girl
goes through a forbidden guy phase .
it &apos;s ... you know , it explains why vampires are
so popular right now .
well , if he were a vampire ,
i could slip garlic in her waffles ,
not that she &apos;d eat them .
hey , distract me . i have , uh ,
noticed you &apos;ve been sleeping out quite a bit this week .
yeah , yeah . just at vanessa &apos;s , you know .
i fall asleep on the extra bed sometimes , studying late .
it &apos;s no big deal .
you always were a bad liar .
obviously , you &apos;re seeing someone .
okay . all right , you got me .
um , it &apos;s actually , uh ,
vanessa .
thank you so much for coming by .
ah . i know i &apos;m overreacting ,
but i just need family by my side ,
and i know you &apos;re practically jenny &apos;s sister .
no , vanessa &apos;s not family . she &apos;s not a sister .
she &apos;s a ... she &apos;s a friend . she &apos;s a classmate , really , you know .
hello .
hey . what &apos;s ... what &apos;s going on ? what are you doing ?
rufus is in the other room .
all right , you know what ?
i think we need to set some guidelines .
guidelines ?
well , you know , zones .
zones where we &apos;re friends only ,
zones where we &apos;re friends with benefits .
and here , where ... where my dad treats you like his own daughter
and we &apos;ve prepared thanksgiving dinner while watching
&quot; the sound of music , &quot; that &apos;s gotta be ...
i think that &apos;s gotta be a friend @-@ only zone .
okay . i see your point .
and llily &apos;s , you know , the upper east side in general ,
actually , that &apos;s a friends @-@ only zone , too .
uh , but downtown , you know , around school ,
that &apos;s friends @-@ with @-@ benefits zone .
i &apos;ll draw you a map . that &apos;s what i &apos;ll do .
it &apos;ll be much easier .
sorry to drag you guys all the way over here ,
but i ... i think i have it handled .
see you later .
i am gonna go back to school .
okay , you know , i &apos;ll come with you .
we can talk about what zone the subway is .
how about the subway is
a no @-@ talking @-@ about @-@ zone @-@ rules zone , okay ?
better yet , classmate ,
a sitting @-@ on @-@ opposite @-@ ends- of @-@ the @-@ car zone .
all right . still drawing a map .
you know , i &apos;ve almost called you a million times .
really ? and why is that ?
to apologize .
the state dinner ... my behavior was ...
yeah , well , um , i actually wanted to apologize , too .
uh , i used you ,
and ... and that was wrong .
but , um , nate and i are over .
uh , i have absolutely no feelings for him anymore .
serena , i &apos;m dating jenny ,
and i actually really like her ,
so i can &apos;t do this .
what ?
great lunch . sorry about nate .
me , too .
nate , what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;ve had coffee and two entire desserts .
can we go now ?
uh @-@ oh . looks like this virgin queen &apos;s next accessory
may be a chastity belt .
you &apos;re gonna dream of the days you were just grounded .
from now , on i will escort you to and from school ,
queller will assign someone to walk you from class to class ,
and you will have lunch in her office .
dad , i ditched class to be with my boyfriend .
so what ? it &apos;s not like it &apos;s affecting my grades .
you can &apos;t keep treating me like a child .
well , you certainly are acting like one .
if you think this guy ...
the one that brought drugs into the house ...
is right for you , you &apos;re a child .
yeah , and if you would listen to him ,
then you &apos;d know that they weren &apos;t his pills .
but you didn &apos;t . you just jumped to conclusions ,
like you always do . you know , it &apos;s no wonder
that you &apos;re marriage is going down the toilet .
i bought you a little something to wear tonight .
oh , thank you .
oh , it &apos;s beautiful .
blair helped me pick it out .
as i recall , purple was your father &apos;s favorite color , too .
actually , i only wear purple
because my father loathed it .
or maybe that &apos;s what he wanted you to think .
bart was playing with people &apos;s heads all the time .
are you all right ?
is it the lawsuit ?
not the lawsuit ,
but , uh , who may be behind it .
my uncle jack just arrived in town .
sounds like jack .
will he be going to the party tonight ?
uh , he &apos;s not invited , but he is a cockroach ,
and they tend to slip in through the cracks .
charles , um ...
your uncle and i ...
we have history .
it &apos;s ugly history .
look , i &apos;m not going to let jack
determine who can and can &apos;t come to my party .
i &apos;m sorry , charles . i don &apos;t know if i have the strength
to deal with him and meet your family at the same time .
i hope you understand .
i understand perfectly .
but since i can &apos;t spend the evening with you ,
stay for a while . have a drink .
of course .
i can see he &apos;s starting to doubt himself .
why wouldn &apos;t he , with the bad press , the protestors ?
the &quot; daily intel &quot; says he &apos;s thinking of stepping down .
chuck &apos;s not stepping anywhere .
ooh , can i borrow that ?
oh , and speaking of things we &apos;ve shared ...
nate , serena doesn &apos;t want to talk to you right now .
well , did she tell you about her little plan to seduce damien
and have jenny walk in on it ?
well , it sounds perfectly reasonable to me .
yeah , because it &apos;s a blair @-@ waldorf @-@ nut @-@ job plan .
i &apos;ll ignore that .
nate , serena and i are getting ready for the party .
now why don &apos;t you just apologize
so we can all move past this
and be supportive for chuck on his big night ?
no , i &apos;m not going to apologize .
i did the right thing , okay ? serena may not get it ,
but losing her virginity
is a huge deal for a girl like jenny .
oh , and it wasn &apos;t for me ? why is that , nate ?
because i was a huge slut when i was jenny &apos;s age ?
look , i didn &apos;t realize i was on speakerphone , okay ?
i didn &apos;t mean to say that .
that &apos;s exactly what you meant .
&quot; dirty dancing &quot; ?
yeah , it &apos;s corny , but it &apos;s kinda good .
come on . it &apos;s totally good .
yeah , baby &apos;s dad &apos;s an even bigger jerk than you .
look , i have to go to this historical society thing
to talk to lily .
obviously , i can &apos;t let you out of my sight ,
so that means you &apos;re coming , too .
but i will be watching you all night .
great .
boycott ! boycott ! boycott !
pathetic !
suburban moralists in mom jeans .
i &apos;d pity them if i wasn &apos;t scared
they &apos;d spill orange soda
on my christian louboutins .
what are you doing ?
are you kidding ?
a d.n.a. sample ?
you &apos;ve been watching too much cbs .
i should have thought of it weeks ago .
a friend of mine at the nypd
says he can have it done in a few hours .
this way we &apos;ll know once and for all who elizabeth really is .
you know who she really is .
you can see it in her eyes ... in your eyes .
jack &apos;s gotten inside your head .
he has a point .
she turns up out of the blue ,
doesn &apos;t know things about my father .
and when she hears that jack ...
the only person who actually met my mother ...
will be at the party tonight , she bails .
blair , she &apos;s supposed to be dead .
elizabeth .
i was coming to tell you i changed my mind .
chuck wasn &apos;t thinking .
i thought ... you were starting to open your heart to me ,
like i was to you .
chuck &apos;s not doing this . it &apos;s just a big misunderstanding .
look , if you are who you say you are ,
you won &apos;t mind me doing a d.n.a. test , right ?
i should have known you would never let me in .
you are your father &apos;s son .
we can drop it off on the way .
i think i &apos;ll just meet you there .
looks like the protestors outside
aren &apos;t the only ones who think bass is an ass .
well , i didn &apos;t expect to see you here .
you haven &apos;t returned any of my calls in weeks .
i &apos;m here to support chuck .
serena , i know that you are angry ,
and maybe someday you &apos;ll understand
why i didn &apos;t tel you i was ...
doing my father when i came to visit him ?
well , that &apos;s ...
save your lies for your current husband .
i have a feeling you &apos;re to thank for the , uh , turnout tonight .
well , people are here because they support you .
none of us believe slander .
well ,
thank you . that means more to me than you know .
did you come here alone ? i thought you would bring blair
and maybe someone else that you wanted me to meet .
i &apos;m solo tonight .
me , too .
thank you .
hey . i didn &apos;t mean it the way it sounded .
what , that i was the concubine of the upper east side ?
well , look , i didn &apos;t want to get into details in front of blair ,
but , come on , serena .
i mean , everyone knows the stories about adam handler ,
uh , jake hendrickson , matt price ...
oh , the art teacher from prague .
i didn &apos;t sleep with all of those guys , nate .
haven &apos;t you heard of locker @-@ room gossip ?
they lied or exaggerated .
serena , i lost my virginity to you
on a bar at the campbell apartment .
and somehow that reflects poorly on me and not you ?
talk about a double standard .
no that &apos;s not what i was talking about .
look , whatever your twisted guy logic is ,
there &apos;s still no reason for you to go behind my back with jenny .
serena , i woke up the morning after i lost my virginity
to find that the person i lost it to ...
the person i loved ...
had left town ,
never to be heard from again for a year .
so , yeah , i had a good reason .
thank you , for coming . arnold , great to see you .
you look glorious , as always .
how dare you show your face
at an event you know my wife is at .
rufus , don &apos;t blow a gasket . i just came to offer my apology .
lily , i wasn &apos;t myself that night at the opera gala .
i &apos;d had a lot to drink ,
took some of those over @-@ the @-@ counter pills
they started keeping behind the counter recently ...
and some meth .
really , i was just in a bad place ,
but now i &apos;m a changed man .
you expect us to buy that ?
it was worth a shot .
i &apos;m not gonna make a scene ,
but if you so much as show up within 50 feet
of this woman again tonight , you &apos;re gonna regret it .
so i guess you found the scarf .
can we go somewhere private to talk ?
great . another lecture ?
come on . did the upper east side crown
cut off the circulation to your brain ?
damien &apos;s my boyfriend .
jenny , you &apos;re 16 . come on .
yeah , and when you were 16 , you were in love with serena ,
and everyone thought it was adorable .
uh , you know what ? just ...
i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll be right back . stay here .
hey , dan . how are you ?
you look amazing .
this is a friends @-@ only zone . i thought we agreed .
well , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s not a friends @-@ only dress .
really ? i @-@ i thought it was perfect . my bad .
oh , and ... and just so you know ,
i &apos;m not wearing any underwear .
go away , traitor .
look , i &apos;m sorry i called rufus ,
but it was for your own good .
i mean , you &apos;re a really special girl , jenny ,
who deserves a guy who &apos;s gonna see that ,
you know , who &apos;s gonna be there in the morning .
not like you &apos;re available .
jenny , damien got aggressive with serena at the state dinner .
shows what you know .
damien only hit on serena to get her
to take off the opera jacket with the drugs in it .
drugs ? is he dealing ?
you can &apos;t be with someone who &apos;s dealing drugs .
why ? it &apos;s not like you &apos;ve never done any .
stop pretending that you care about me .
in fact , the only one who does just got here .
hi . how you doing ?
good . how are you ?
i &apos;m sorry , man .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m letting you leave with her .
really ?
let &apos;s get out of here .
damien .
looks like little j. is about to do
some dirty dancing of her own .
nate . hey , you okay ?
yeah .
what happened ?
it &apos;s jenny .
she ran off with damien . the guy &apos;s a drug dealer .
what ?
yeah .
he &apos;s staying at the smyth .
okay .
all right , i &apos;m gonna call you when i find &apos; em .
where are my mom and rufus ?
so i went to holland &apos;s .
i don &apos;t know what i thought would happen .
but i guess a part of me wanted to even the score .
but when the time came , i couldn &apos;t go through with it ,
because the truth is , uh , i love you , lily ,
and i couldn &apos;t do that to you .
i love you .
i &apos;ve always loved you .
dad .
jenny ran off with damien , and he &apos;s worse than we thought .
oh , god .
doug . don &apos;t give me that lawyer face .
people still showed up tonight . things can &apos;t be that bad .
actually ...
things have taken a turn .
we &apos;re getting attacked by christian conservatives .
we have those in manhattan ?
the family travel council &apos;s organizing a boycott .
you &apos;d be shocked how much influence they have .
that &apos;s the kind of thing
that would only entice my target clientele .
i don &apos;t think the business has
the luxury of waiting around to see .
i &apos;m sorry , chuck .
for p.r. , if nothing else ,
it needs to seem that you &apos;re no longer in charge .
you need to hand over operations of the hotel ,
at least temporarily .
perhaps a family member ....
i &apos;ll do it .
doug . give us a moment .
i promise you , jack ...
that will never happen .
then i &apos;ll wait .
and when your beloved hotel is bankrupt and empty ,
i &apos;ll swoop in and give you fair @-@ market price .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s some copper pipes i could salvage .
this was your plan , wasn &apos;t it ?
no . but i &apos;m totally gonna reap its rewards .
you took what was mine .
now i &apos;m gonna take what &apos;s yours .
at least you know it &apos;s staying in the family .
what room is damien dalgaard in ?
i &apos;m sorry , sir . i can &apos;t give out that information .
would you like me to call up ?
well , i seriously doubt he &apos;s gonna answer the phone ,
considering he &apos;s up there alone with a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
oh , my gosh . thanks for showing up tonight
and risking the wrath of my dad ,
punching nate freaking archibald .
let me give you a real reason to thank me .
booking a room at the empire was genius .
you sure you wanna do this ?
yeah .
i told you there &apos;d be a new scandal before the day was out .
but we can talk about that later . what &apos;s wrong ?
a boycott .
doug says i have no choice
but to sign my hotel over to someone else .
jack nominated himself .
of course he did .
i can take over .
i don &apos;t think signing the hotel over
to my 19 @-@ year @-@ old girlfriend
would ease the public &apos;s mind .
what about lily ?
she &apos;s bass industries .
the last thing i want is my father &apos;s company bailing me out .
i don &apos;t see what choice you have .
the d.n.a. results .
what do they say ?
looks like i &apos;ve got another choice .
damien , um ,
there &apos;s something that you should know before ...
what is it ? you can tell me anything .
i &apos;m a virgin .
i just wanted you to know
in case ...
uh , i just wanted you to know .
i kinda figured .
it &apos;s really not a big deal .
well ... actually , i mean , it is ...
it is kind of a big deal for me .
i mean ...
i chose you , and that ...
it means something to me . does it ...
jenny , why don &apos;t we talk about this after ?
okay ?
no , i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t want to do this .
damien , where ...
where are you going ?
i knew you were just a kid .
well , the police are looking into it ,
but they don &apos;t seem optimistic
that they &apos;re gonna find them tonight .
they &apos;re not at the hotel .
there was nothing any one of us could have done .
jenny &apos;s mind was set .
everyone will be happy to know
that damien and i broke up .
jenny , i &apos;m sorry for you , but that &apos;s what happens ...
whatever , dad . am i still grounded ?
yes .
okay . i &apos;ll just , um ,
stay at home for the rest of the year .
all right , now i &apos;m really tired ,
so if it &apos;s okay with you , i &apos;d just like to go to my room .
hey . you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
that &apos;s a relief .
so then you and damien didn &apos;t ...
no , we did .
honestly , serena ,
i don &apos;t know what you were so worried about .
it was no big deal .
would you mind closing the door on your way out ?
i should have trusted you .
the test came back ?
it &apos;s hard for me to let people in .
i abandoned you when you were just a baby .
how could it not be ?
i want to change .
i want to trust you . i need to ,
because i need someone to take over operations of my hotel
for a while .
what ?
it &apos;s mostly just a signing authority .
i &apos;d still have a voice behind the scenes .
it just needs to look like i &apos;m gone ,
until the scandal subsides .
charles , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s too much .
there are other people who &apos;d do a better job .
i don &apos;t trust those other people .
those other people aren &apos;t my mother .
look , it &apos;s not hard . i &apos;ll show you everything
you need to know .
you just have to sign these papers .
hello , mother .
lily , it &apos;s been six months . i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s time
we check back in with the good dr. van der woodsen .
can &apos;t we get someone else to do the tests ?
i mean , does it really have to be him ?
you know he &apos;s the right choice ,
and it &apos;s been too long already .
please , darling . for me .
okay .
i &apos;ll get on the next plane out .
thank you , dear .
lil ?
hey . everything okay ?
actually , that was my mother ,
and she is at canyon ranch .
and normally , i could ignore her pleas , but ...
you should go .
i think jenny and i need some time right now anyway .
maybe when you come back , you and i can start all over .
i would love that .
clean slate .
absolutely .
clean slate .
so , uh , so , listen ,
i know your room is a benefits @-@ only zone ...
but , uh , right now i @-@ i need to talk to my friend .
fine . i &apos;ll make an exception . shoot .
well , you see , there &apos;s this girl ,
and ... and under normal circumstances ,
i &apos;d tell everyone , &quot; hey , everybody .
&quot; i &apos;m seeing this amazing girl .
i think it might be serious . &quot;
but this girl and i ...
we agreed that that would be a mistake .
interesting .
the thing is , keeping these feelings aside
is ... is ... is killing me , cause all i want to do is
tell everyone how happy i am .
how happy are you ?
oh , i &apos;m very , very happy , very happy ,
the kind of happy that people write embarrassing songs about .
then , as your friend ,
i think you should tell people .
and as long as this is still a benefits @-@ only zone ...
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell you i was calling rufus .
no , it &apos;s okay . my plan was dumb anyway .
nate , i ...
i &apos;m really sorry i left the morning after we ...
you know , i never meant to hurt you .
oh , i know .
i wish that somehow , we could relive that night ,
because this time i know that you love me ,
and you know that i love you .
what are we celebrating ?
the lawsuit ?
the scandal ?
the fact i just signed over my hotel ?
we &apos;re celebrating you ...
opening your heart to your mother ...
and ... me ...
being the woman who encouraged you to do it .
and just like that chuck bass celebrating a new love .
well ? do we have ourselves a hotel ?
we do .
careful , chuck .
it &apos;s an open heart
that &apos;s vulnerable to the deepest wound .
