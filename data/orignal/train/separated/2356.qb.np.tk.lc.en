vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power .
since then , werewolves can only turn on a full moon
and vampires are weakened by the sun .
the werewolf part of the curse is sealed with a moonstone .
he told me about your ex , katherine .
you must be elena .
how do we look exactly alike ?
the moonstone is what breaks the curse .
sacrifice is what breaks it .
the blood of the doppelganger . you &apos;re the doppelganger .
elijah . one of the originals .
klaus is the real deal .
the oldest vampire in the history of time
is coming after me ?
what is happening ?
why are you helping me ?
i was alone when i turned .
i don &apos;t want that to happen to you .
i don &apos;t want to be saved .
not even if it means that klaus is gonna kill
every single person that i love .
rosemary .
i don &apos;t want to run anymore
because i don &apos;t have anywhere else to run to .
she was just scared . she didn &apos;t mean to run .
yes , she did . she &apos;s been running for 500 years .
go !
i &apos;ll find a way to get you out .
no matter what happens , we &apos;ll protect her .
promise .
that right there was the biggest mistake you &apos;ve ever made .
come on , come on .
it &apos;s mason . leave a message .
mason , it &apos;s tyler again .
look , your cell &apos;s voicemail &apos;s full .
i need to talk to you .
it &apos;s a full moon tomorrow ,
and i found your recording and i &apos;m freaking out over here .
so , please call me back .
please .
help !
now that you &apos;ve got this back , what are you gonna do with it ?
right now , it &apos;s what &apos;s binding the sun and moon curse .
if i can figure out a way
to remove the spell from the stone ,
the stone becomes useless .
and according to katherine , klaus becomes vengeful .
maybe . if he finds out .
bonnie , can &apos;t this wait ?
stefan is stuck in the tomb with katherine .
we &apos;ve gotta get him out .
stefan wants me to focus on this .
well , don &apos;t listen to him .
he thinks he &apos;s protecting me , but he &apos;s wrong .
i &apos;m taking stefan &apos;s side with this one .
i &apos;m not gonna let you get used in some creepy sacrifice ritual .
what are you guys arguing about ?
not arguing about anything .
i need a coffee .
what ?
why are you on some suicide mission ?
i &apos;m trying to prevent everyone else from getting hurt .
oh , so bringing klaus the moonstone
so you can get yourself killed is ok ?
where are you going ?
to see stefan .
you &apos;re lying .
no , i &apos;m not .
really ?
tell your face .
are you serious ?
she took the moonstone .
how did you--
we tested you .
and you failed .
klaus killed katherine &apos;s entire family
just because she crossed him .
i can &apos;t let that happen .
what did you do ?
it &apos;s for the best , elena .
you trapped her in the house ?
it &apos;s for the best . trust me .
elena &apos;s on a martyr tear .
it rivals your greatest hits .
you should be glad the witch and i are getting along .
i brought you this .
care package-- candles , lanterns ...
and ... lunch .
give that to me , i &apos;m just gonna have to share it with her .
yeah .
you know , you two are surprisingly calm
considering klaus will hunt you down and kill you
if you mess up his little plan .
i &apos;ve been dead before . i got over it .
once we deal with this moonstone ,
we &apos;re gonna figure a way to get you out .
don &apos;t worry about me .
just make sure elena &apos;s safe .
heading out ?
yeah .
lunch at the grill .
i &apos;ve got a practice .
then we &apos;ll probably go out after .
i &apos;ll be late .
sorry , rude .
you have no idea who i am .
i &apos;m jules ,
a friend of mason &apos;s from florida .
you must be tyler .
yeah .
nice to meet you .
so , i know it &apos;s weird of me to just stop by ,
but i &apos;m trying to track down mason .
mason &apos;s back in florida .
he has been for a while now .
see , uh , that &apos;s the thing .
he &apos;s not .
so now i &apos;m playing historical society hostess
to some writer who &apos;s doing this book on small @-@ town virginia .
that sounds ...
lame .
yeah .
but carol lockwood played the dead husband card ,
said she was too busy to deal .
plus , my sister kept most of the archives ,
so , there you have it .
what &apos;s wrong ?
this girl mason knows stopped by the house .
she said he never made it back to florida .
my mom &apos;s freaking out
and she was on the phone with your mom when i left .
we should get going .
yeah .
you should really lock your door .
oh , come on , pouty .
at least give me 2 points for ingenuity .
do you think this is funny ?
yes , elena . i find hilarity in the lengths that i have to go to ,
to repeatedly save your life .
what did stefan say about this ?
he had a good laugh .
and what did he say
about elijah still being alive ?
yeah , that .
i didn &apos;t tell him .
why not ?
well , a--he can &apos;t do anything about it ,
and b ...
what i just said .
where &apos;s bonnie ?
i though she was meeting you .
no . she &apos;s on moonstone duty
and i &apos;m on ... elena patrol .
and who &apos;s on tyler lockwood and the full moon ?
vampire barbie asked me
if she could handle it ,
and i said why not ? i figured if she screwed up ,
he &apos;d bite her and then i &apos;ll be rid of two of my problems .
hold on a second . tonight &apos;s the full moon ?
yep , but you &apos;re too absorbed
with your suicidal tendencies to notice .
what ?
sheriff forbes has officially declared
mason lockwood a missing person .
what ? why ?
some girl from florida
showed up on the lockwoods &apos; doorstep looking for mason .
what girl ?
i don &apos;t know .
but she &apos;s sure got everyone in a tizzy .
that &apos;s not good . where are you ?
i &apos;m at the grill .
i &apos;m on my way .
change of plans . you baby @-@ sit .
hey , you know , you should get out ,
enjoy the sun .
oh , wait . you can &apos;t .
well , maybe he just , like ,
stopped to go surf somewhere .
you know , isn &apos;t that mason &apos;s whole thing ?
maybe .
this girl just seemed to think he would have called .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s ok .
yeah .
anyway ...
let &apos;s do this .
so you &apos;ll call me as soon as you hear anything ?
of course .
oh , i didn &apos;t get to say goodbye to your son .
i &apos;m afraid he &apos;s at the grill with his friends .
i &apos;ll let him know .
jules ...
let &apos;s hope for the best .
hey , i &apos;m here .
no one knows where mason is . he &apos;s missing .
you were right .
mason was lying . there &apos;s another werewolf .
his nephew .
hey , excuse me .
uh , crazy question .
do you know tyler lockwood ?
mason &apos;s mystery woman .
where is mason , anyway ?
decomposing in his truck .
if you see him , let him know , please .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
so you think she &apos;s a werewolf ?
well , i hope not ,
being that it &apos;s a full moon , alaric .
but we should definitely find out .
and what is that ?
wolfsbane .
tell me you brought the instruction manual .
tell me you brought the wolfsbane .
yes . um , not an easy herb to find .
but this is it .
i have water bottles in my bag .
we can mix it in there .
ok .
the guy at the hardware store
said this setup was rated up to 5,000 pounds .
is that more than a werewolf can pull ?
i have no idea .
hey , tyler .
how you doing ?
still human .
oh , my god . you &apos;re not gonna get naked , are you ?
it &apos;s elastic .
i mean , what should i wear ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s like the hulk
where i get to keep my pants .
i don &apos;t know what makes me more upset--
that i showed you how to channel
or that you almost killed me .
look , i &apos;m so sorry .
i wouldn &apos;t have done what i did
unless it was really important .
it &apos;s just that there &apos;s things that i--
i forgive you .
so much stuff .
what is that ?
is this a grimoire ?
they &apos;re all grimoires .
how &apos;d you get all these ?
well , witches from all over the world
have collected their spells in grimoires ,
but over the centuries , most of them have gotten lost ,
and my dad is obsessed with finding them
and making sure that our family &apos;s heritage stays intact .
these can &apos;t all be your family &apos;s .
the way he sees it , all witches are family .
we &apos;re all bonded together by a code of loyalty
to help each other .
so that &apos;s why you &apos;ve been so nice to me .
that &apos;s one reason .
listen ...
do you know how to break the bind
between a talisman and a spell ?
uh , well , that depends ,
because spells are unique and very specific .
but , uh , i &apos;m ...
sure we can figure it out .
can i have a scotch
and whatever this beautiful woman is drinking ?
oh , no , one &apos;s my limit .
oh , come on , it &apos;s not like i &apos;m a freak .
just being friendly to somebody who &apos;s new in town .
ok , if you insist .
how do you know i &apos;m new ?
because i have never seen you here before .
and i am here every night .
excuse me , is this guy bothering you ?
i &apos;m not bothering anybody .
perfect . well ...
do it elsewhere .
don &apos;t worry , he &apos;s harmless .
you know , he &apos;s sort of the town drunk
and , you know , when we get tired of him ,
we just put him in a cab
and send him back where he came from .
please don &apos;t talk about me like i &apos;m not here .
why are you here ?
thank you for the drink .
so we &apos;re fasting now ?
we &apos;re so pious .
how long have you actually gone without blood ?
i know you get desiccation in theory , stefan ,
but in reality , it &apos;s much worse .
your heart still beats ,
struggling to pump whatever blood remains .
and when it &apos;s gone ,
your veins rub together like sandpaper .
it &apos;s excruciating .
the pleasure i &apos;ll get in watching you suffer
is greater than any pain i &apos;ll ever feel .
it &apos;s stuffy ,
and i &apos;ve been in this dress for days .
you want to help me get out of it ?
oh , come on , stefan ,
don &apos;t be such a grump .
we &apos;re here together .
we may as well make the best out of it .
you really think damon &apos;s in a rush to get you out ?
he &apos;s got what he wants .
elena .
stop .
hey . given what &apos;s most certainly
going on out there ,
i &apos;d say you &apos;re free to do whatever you want in here .
nobody will ever know .
stay out of my head .
maybe i can do eternity in here after all .
hey . what are you doing ?
oh . perfect timing .
what is this stuff ?
your mom &apos;s files from the historical society .
i got roped into helping mrs. lockwood .
and by roped , i mean very excited to participate .
hey . i &apos;m elijah .
elijah &apos;s in town doing research on mystic falls .
it &apos;s a pleasure .
so , you know , you &apos;re welcome to stay here
and rummage through this stuff ,
or elena and i could help you load it into your car .
yeah , or i can get someone to pick it up tomorrow .
also a good plan .
thank you so much for inviting me into your home , jenna .
and , elena ...
i hope to see you again sometime soon .
what is it ?
um , jenna was just asking me to ...
get you to help her with the boxes .
yeah .
that &apos;s a wise choice .
what do you want ?
i think it &apos;s time you and i had a little chat .
there &apos;s a b &amp; b down the road ,
then there &apos;s a motel off of i @-@ 9,
but , you know , if you ask me ,
i think it &apos;s kind of a mistake .
no frills is fine . i &apos;m just here for the night .
long story . looking for my friend .
oh . who ?
mason lockwood .
i know mason .
you do ?
yeah . he &apos;s a great guy .
he &apos;s missing .
what do you mean ? like ...
i mean , missing missing ?
how do you know mason ?
friends of friends .
what time is it ?
it &apos;s almost 8 : 00 .
what time does the moon crest-- or whatever ?
not for a while .
mason &apos;s journal said the first transformation
can happen before the moon hits its apex .
does it say how long you &apos;ll actually ...
be a wolf ?
a few hours .
maybe more .
maybe less .
are you sure-- are you sure you want to do that ?
yeah .
mason said it &apos;ll diminish my strength ...
so i can &apos;t break free .
tyler .
tyler .
don &apos;t !
don &apos;t ! you don &apos;t !
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , forgive the intrusion .
i mean your family no harm .
why did you kill those vampires
when they tried to take me ?
because i didn &apos;t want you to be taken .
klaus is the most feared and hated
of the originals ,
but those that fear him are desperate for his approval .
if word gets out that the doppelganger exists ,
there &apos;ll be a line of vampires eager to take you to him ,
and i can &apos;t have that .
isn &apos;t that exactly what you &apos;re trying to do ?
let &apos;s just say that my goal is not to break the curse .
so what is your goal ?
klaus &apos; obsessions have made him paranoid .
he &apos;s a recluse .
he trusts only those in his immediate circle .
like you ?
not anymore .
you don &apos;t know where he is , do you ?
so you &apos;re trying to use me to draw him out .
well , to do that , i need you to stay put
and stop trying to get yourself killed .
how do i know you &apos;re telling the truth ?
well , if i wasn &apos;t being truthful , all your family would be dead
and i &apos;d be taking you to klous right now .
instead ,
i &apos;m here , and i &apos;m prepared to offer you a deal .
what kind of a deal ?
do nothing .
do nothing , live your life ,
stop fighting .
and then , when the time is right ,
you and i shall shall draw klaus out together ,
and i shall make certain that your friends remain unharmed .
and then what ?
then i kill him .
just like that ?
just like that .
i &apos;m a man of my word , elena .
i make a deal , i keep a deal .
how are you going to be able to keep everybody safe ?
you know , i notice you have a friend , bonnie , is it ?
she seems to possess the gift of magic .
i have friends with similar gifts .
you know witches .
together we can
protect everybody that matters to you .
so do we have a deal ?
i need you to do one more thing for me .
we &apos;re negotiating now ?
yeah , this is good .
this is really good . it &apos;s a clear view of the moon .
and it &apos;s private .
and anyone looks up
and they &apos;re gonna think we &apos;re insane .
aren &apos;t we ?
so , uh , what &apos;s this mysterious talisman we &apos;re unbinding ?
oh , wow . a white rock .
this is fascinating .
hey , i know it doesn &apos;t look like much ...
what &apos;s it spelled with ?
really ?
help a girl out , she still keeps secrets .
sorry ?
i &apos;m just teasing .
ready ?
no , no .
tyler . tyler .
i &apos;m burning up .
it burns !
i know . you just gotta breathe through this , ok ?
i &apos;m trying .
you should go .
mm @-@ mmm .
you should leave .
not yet .
tyler .
tyler .
tyler !
it hurts .
it hurts .
you know , listen , i &apos;m really tight with the sheriff .
if there &apos;s anything i can do to help locate mason , i will .
he &apos;s a great guy . and after his brother &apos;s funeral ,
he stuck around and-- and helped his nephew and--
tyler ?
yep .
mason was with him the whole time .
helped him through all that grief .
you haven &apos;t touched your drink .
you know , i &apos;m not much of a drinker . i should get going .
oh , come on . look , one drink .
it &apos;ll help me sleep .
to sleep .
you fool .
you think you &apos;re clever , don &apos;t you ?
what do you want with mason lockwood ?
he &apos;s my friend .
well , i &apos;m sorry to inform you
that you probably won &apos;t find him .
and why not ?
you should leave town .
are you threatening me ?
on a full moon .
how stupid are you ?
damon , how about that second round ?
i think we &apos;re done , rick .
you think i &apos;m afraid of you ?
no , i don &apos;t . that &apos;s your vampire arrogance .
you should be .
i sniffed you out the moment you entered this bar .
along with your pathetic wolfsbane .
see , i &apos;ve been at this a long time .
and any other night of the month ,
the situation would be reversed ,
but tonight ... is not the night to pick a fight with me .
you &apos;ve been marked .
i want to help , but i don &apos;t know what to do .
there &apos;s ...
there &apos;s nothing you can do .
tyler ...
get out !
no !
get out !
i don &apos;t want to hurt you .
no . no .
where is she ?
let it go , damon . don &apos;t be stupid .
what , i &apos;m supposed to let her just get away ?
&quot; you &apos;ve been marked . &quot;
what the hell kind of wolf throw @-@ down crap is that , anyway ?
damon , look up . just look up .
if this werewolf stuff is true ,
one bite and you &apos;re dead . one bite .
all right ? don &apos;t risk it .
just go home , lock your doors ,
and we &apos;ll deal with it in the morning .
yeah .
it &apos;s okay .
you fight through it , okay ?
sleep .
leave .
no .
go ! please !
no , not yet .
just go .
i &apos;m right here .
and i &apos;m not going anywhere .
i &apos;m sorry .
tyler !
you just can &apos;t stay away , can you ?
well , you don &apos;t answer your phone .
what do you want ?
i wanted to apologize .
just admit it . you don &apos;t have anywhere else to go .
i &apos;m sorry about elena .
i wasn &apos;t thinking straight . i didn &apos;t know she had a death wish .
but i called you . i tried to make it right , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry , damon .
and i--i have nowhere else to go .
there &apos;s nothing here for you , rose .
well , then ...
damon !
how bad is it ?
it hurts .
it &apos;s healing .
i thought a werewolf bit was fatal . i thought ...
it &apos;s all right .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
you were successful ?
of course i was .
she fell for the whole ...
show and didn &apos;t suspect a thing .
thank you , luka .
yeah , whatever . i &apos;m going to sleep .
wait .
there &apos;s one more thing elijah needs us to do
before we lose the full moon .
are we seriously not going to talk at all ?
oh , we could talk about how you regret
all you &apos;ve done to make my life miserable .
what do you want me to say , stefan ?
that i &apos;m sorry for everything that i &apos;ve done ?
well , i &apos;m not , ok ?
it &apos;s called self @-@ preservation .
i &apos;ve been looking out for myself for 500 years .
oh ... look where it &apos;s gotten you .
yes , i &apos;ve done terrible things .
i know that .
but i do love you , stefan .
even if you don &apos;t believe it .
you want me to believe you .
show me . do something .
prove to me that there &apos;s something inside of you
that &apos;s actually worth trusting .
and then what ?
you &apos;re still gonna hate me .
well , maybe .
and maybe i &apos;ll see that there &apos;s still hope for you after all .
you &apos;re playing me .
am i ?
you want to find klaus ,
kill him so that you can protect your precious elena ?
let me guess . you know where he is .
no , i don &apos;t .
but i could help you find him .
for a price , i &apos;m sure .
let &apos;s start with isobel ,
elena &apos;s mother .
she was a research expert .
she found me .
you &apos;re welcome .
elijah .
good evening , katerina .
thank you for having the good sense to be frightened .
your release has been requested .
what ? by who ?
the lovely elena drives a hard bargain .
however , we reached a peaceful agreement , she and i.
please ...
come .
i can &apos;t .
yes , you can .
i &apos;ve had the spell lifted .
as for you , however ,
you shall not exit until i say so .
when klaus comes , he &apos;ll want to know exactly where you are .
you &apos;re free to go .
elena will explain the arrangement to you .
if she keeps her word ,
i &apos;ll keep mine .
stefan , no .
please , don &apos;t let him leave me in here .
goodbye , katherine .
tyler ?
caroline ?
tyler ? !
tyler .
oh , my god .
you &apos;re ok .
you &apos;re ok .
you made it . you didn &apos;t get out .
you &apos;re ok .
no , i &apos;m not .
i talked to caroline .
she said tyler was all locked up .
so , it was jules ,
the other werewolf , the one who attacked you .
yeah . i &apos;m sorry .
i picked a fight with her .
she was coming after me .
all &apos;s well that ends well .
you all healed ?
yeah .
see it &apos;s that way .
rose , uh ...
i &apos;m happy that the legend was fake .
maybe the werewolves made it up
to keep vampires away .
lucky me .
i &apos;m gonna stay and help you .
help me do what ?
save elena .
protect elena , all things elena .
really ?
why ?
because i like you .
i believe in friendship .
i happen to have a vacancy in that department ,
and you can use all the friends you can get .
just friends ?
just friends .
you sure you can do that ?
i don &apos;t love men who love other women .
i think more of myself than that .
but that doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t be a special friend .
