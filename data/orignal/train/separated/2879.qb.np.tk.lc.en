who knows what could happen .
i might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides .
okay ! i got it , i got it.i can &apos;t go with the &quot; you and my sister &quot; thing .
it &apos;s just too weird , all right ?

i don &apos;t know what you guys are so sad about . it all works out .
e.t. stays with elliott , and they get to be best friends forever .
you &apos;ve seen this movie before , e.t. goes back home .
what ?
oh , no , i forgot .
you know what &apos;s sadder than this ? bambi .
i cried for three days with that movie . no , two .
the third day my mom killed herself , so i was partly crying for that .
well , that i can see crying over , but bambi is a cartoon .
you didn &apos;t cry when bambi &apos;s mother died ?
yes , it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer .
if this movie &apos;s making you guys cry so much , let &apos;s just change the channel .
there .
joey , you &apos;re crying over a doritos commercial .
i was up for that part .
it &apos;s okay to cry . you don &apos;t have to be macho all the time .
i &apos;m not macho.yeah , you &apos;re right .
i don &apos;t know what i was thinking .
i just never really cried . i &apos;m not a crying kind of guy .
come on , there &apos;s gotta be something that gets you choked up . like ...
what if you saw a three @-@ legged puppy ?
i &apos;d be sad , sure.but i wouldn &apos;t cry .
what if the puppy said , &quot; help me , chandler
all the other puppies pick on me . &quot;
cry ? i just found a talking puppy . i &apos;m rich !
i &apos;ve got it . i have got it.pictures from your childhood.this &apos;ll get you going good .
oh , what &apos;s going on there ?
parents &apos; day . first grade.that &apos;s me with the janitor , martin .
where are your parents ?
they didn &apos;t want to come .
chandler !
poor thing .
that story doesn &apos;t make you cry ?
no . look , i don &apos;t cry . it &apos;s not a big deal , okay ?
no ! it &apos;s not okay ! it &apos;s not okay at all !
you &apos;re dead inside !
excuse me ? -yeah ? -are you phoebe buffay ? -yeah .

you &apos;re just saying that because you &apos;re my biggest fan .
take good care of that guy . he &apos;s a fan .
bye .
so you saw me on days of our lives , huh ?
you want me to do a little dr. drake ramoray for you ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about.but i just got phoebe buffay &apos;s autograph .
oh . you &apos;re phoebe &apos;s fan.oh , yeah . i &apos;ve seen all her movies .
movies ?
that was phoebe buffay , the porn star .
i don &apos;t think so.no , it was . she was in sex toy story two ...
lawrence of a labia .
and i got her autograph.the guys at the comic book store won &apos;t believe this .
gunther ? don &apos;t let that guy in here anymore . he said phoebe &apos;s a porn star .
well , i wouldn &apos;t call her a star , but she &apos;s really good .
you should check out inspect her gadget .
ross just totally blew me off , and he didn &apos;t even tell me why .
the best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else .
oh ! there is this great guy you will just love at work , named bob.he &apos;s a real up @-@ and @-@ comer in human resources .
maybe i talk too much , or maybe i should have been more aggressive sexually .
no , no , no .
no , that would never have worked on ross .
but you know who that might work on ? bob in human resources .
thanks , but i &apos;m not gonna date some random guy from your work .
not random . bob .
it &apos;s probably because i &apos;m not mature enough or smart enough ...
maybe he doesn &apos;t like the way i dress .
no , that can &apos;t be it . it &apos;s gotta be the smart thing .
i &apos;m so stupid . i &apos;m just this , like , incredibly pretty , stupid girl .
no , honey.okay.okay. you want to know why ross canceled the date ?
because i asked him to .
you asked him to ?
why ?
because you are my sister ... and ross and i have this huge history .
you want to go out with ross ?
no .
you don &apos;t want him , but you don &apos;t want me to have him ?
you know , bob in human resources ...
i can &apos;t believe you did this ! you had me doubting how smart i was !
you had me doubting my fashion sense !
it &apos;s not that big a deal . just don &apos;t date ross . there &apos;s other ..
you have no right to tell me what to do .
i &apos;m not telling you what to do . i am telling you what not to do !
why are you so jealous of me ?
this is not about me being jealous.it &apos;s about you being a brat , wanting what you can &apos;t have .
can &apos;t have ?
excuse me . the only thing i can &apos;t have is dairy !
well , you just blew your chances at dating bob !
who ?
with human resources !
jealous of her ? who does she think she is , princess caroline ?
you &apos;re jealous of princess caroline ?
do i have my own castle ?
hey.phoebe &apos;s not here , is she ?
no .
did you get a movie ?
yeah . yeah.but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s the kind you &apos;re gonna like .
not more movies that &apos;ll have us reaching for the tissues all night ?
sort of .
what &apos;s going on ?
phoebe &apos;s a porn star !
what ? -yeah ! what are you talking about ?
&quot; phoebe buffay in buffay the vampire layer . &quot;
that &apos;s phoebe . where did you get that ?
at the adult video place on bleecker .
and i saw joey was about to go in , so i ran in ahead of him ... to surprise him .
then i pretended that i didn &apos;t know he was in there .
wow . i mean , i just can &apos;t believe this .
i mean , you think you know someone.even phoebe , who &apos;s always been somewhat of a question mark .
this is so bizarre .
i guess it makes sense . she had such a terrible childhood .
i had a bad childhood and i don &apos;t do porn .
yes , but you &apos;re dead inside .
i &apos;d better take that back.what , why ? why ?
we can &apos;t watch it . it &apos;s phoebe .
we shouldn &apos;t watch this.absolutely not . that goes back .
maybe a bit .
the first half ?
this is wrong , you guys ! phoebe &apos;s our friend !
i &apos;m not gonna watch it .
yeah ! good for you , joe .
i thought i &apos;d find you here , nosferatool .
are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places ?
actually , i was kind of hoping it would be the other way around .
what &apos;s that on her ankle ? her ankle is what you &apos;re watching ?
well , it &apos;s hard to tell .
god , if she would just stop moving .
she &apos;s just doing her job .
you sick bastards !
it &apos;s a tattoo.that &apos;s weird . phoebe doesn &apos;t ..
wait , that &apos;s ursula ! that &apos;s not phoebe ! that is ursula !
wait , wait ! i can watch that ! rewind it ! rewind it !
hey.what &apos;s up ?
oh , my god ! what am i doing ? !
hey , sweetie .
&quot; chicken soup for the soul &quot; ?
there &apos;s no back to this couch .
you hate this kind of stuff.i figured i &apos;d give it a shot .
one of the stories may make me cry , then you won &apos;t think i &apos;m dead inside .
oh , that &apos;s so sweet .
i don &apos;t care if you can &apos;t cry . i love you .
oh , that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest .
stop it .
seriously . we get married , i &apos;m up at the altar and i &apos;m like this :
i won &apos;t care.i know that you &apos;ll be feeling it all in here .
yeah ?
yeah .
and if we have a baby one day and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room
and you don &apos;t cry , so what ?
if we take him to college and come home ... and we see his empty room for the first time
and you got nothing ? it won &apos;t matter to me .
okay.i won &apos;t worry about this anymore then .
and then , you know , if i die ...
from a long illness ... and you &apos;re writing my eulogy
and you open the desk drawer and find a note from me that says :
&quot; i will always be with you ... &quot;
and you still can &apos;t shed one tiny tear ? i know you &apos;ll be crying a river inside .
i love you .
what is wrong with you ? !
what ?
what ? you can &apos;t shed a tear for your dead wife ?
i left you a note from the beyond !
so you didn &apos;t mean any of that ?
no , you robot !
you damn kids ! you ring my bell one more time and i swear ..
oh , jill ! that &apos;s a game i play with the kids down the hall .
they &apos;ve really taken a liking to me .
what &apos;s the matter ?
rachel and i had a big fight . can i come in ?
i know we &apos;re not supposed to see each other anymore .
i don &apos;t know anybody in this city and i need somebody to talk to .
sure . what happened ? i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
okay .
you know what might cheer me up ? -what ?
seeing some more of your super cool slides .
wow , really ?
totally . i loved them .
you could finish telling me about the different kinds of sand .
i &apos;d love to . wait right here , i &apos;ll go get the projector and my notes .
thanks . you &apos;re such a good friend .
have you guys seen jill ? i can &apos;t find her .
no .
is ross home ? maybe i &apos;ll call him and see if he &apos;s seen her ..
who is it ? it &apos;s phoebe ... &quot; phoebe &quot; !
hey ! -oh , god !
so you &apos;re making porn movies.no , i &apos;m not .
we &apos;re still rolling ! you &apos;re making one right now !
let &apos;s go , phoebe.and you &apos;re using my name .
can i help you with something ?
phoebe , come on ! look , i &apos;m talking right now .
you mean her . oh .
you know , twin stuff is always a real big seller.what ?
i could talk them into giving you ... thirty dollars .
no ! no way ! no !
and stop using my name ! and shame on you !
and shame on all of you ! you &apos;re disgusting ! especially you , with that !
the slides are almost ready .
yeah.i know what this is missing : alcohol .
there &apos;s wine in the kitchen.oh , great .
what is my sister doing there , and why are the drapes shut ?
okay . rach , calm down , okay ? she &apos;s really upset . we &apos;re just talking .
she &apos;s making something happen with you to get back at me .
that &apos;s the only reason she could be here , huh ?
it couldn &apos;t be that maybe i &apos;m a good listener ... and i put on a great slide show ?
ross , i am telling you , she is using you to get back at me .
i think i can take care of myself . i &apos;ll talk to you later . goodbye .
that was your sister , actually.she thinks you &apos;re just using me .
so ?
i just came from the company ursula works for .
oh , no , not you too ?
i went to get phoebe buffay &apos;s checks . there were a lot of them .
nice !
and i won &apos;t have to go back there anymore ... because i gave them my &quot; correct address . &quot;
isn &apos;t it gonna bother you that people think you &apos;re a porn star ?
oh , no , i know how to handle it .
good .
yeah .
trying to figure out how you know me ?
i &apos;ll give you a hint . from porn !
yeah , your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie !
see ? -yeah .
you may have been right about jill .
i knew it ! what happened ?
she kissed me.what ? you kissed ?
maybe we should give them some privacy ...
look , i tried not to kiss her , okay ?
doesn &apos;t sound like it . it &apos;s easy not to kiss someone.you just don &apos;t .
look at us right now , not kissing !
let me finish , okay ? she started kissing me ... and i didn &apos;t stop it .
i guess i just wasn &apos;t thinking .
yeah . let me give you something to think about .
hold on ! but then i started thinking and i stopped the kissing .
thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister &apos;s mouth to tell me that .
i realized if anything happened with me and jill ... then nothing could ever happen with us .
what ?
no , i mean ... i don &apos;t know if anything is ever going to happen with us ... again , ever .
but i don &apos;t want to know that it never could.so i stopped it
and she got mad and broke my projector .
i don &apos;t even know what to say .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
my god , are you crying ? i just don &apos;t see why those two can &apos;t work things out !
all right , i &apos;m leaving .
i &apos;m not spending one more day with someone who &apos;s out to sabotage me .
that &apos;s you , rachel .
yeah , i got that .
and you ! i throw myself at you ... and you say no ? how gay are you ?
you take care , jill .
okay , i &apos;m leaving . don &apos;t worry about me , i &apos;ll make it on my own .
who knows how i &apos;ll get by , or even if i &apos;ll survive .
you can stop that now , i know you made up with daddy .
you do ? how ?
oh , just a wild guess ... and your limo just pulled up .
sorry i didn &apos;t get to know you guys better .
absolute shame .
okay , see you .

i can &apos;t believe jill &apos;s gone .
