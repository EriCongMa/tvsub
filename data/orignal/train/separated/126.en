总监 夕橙橙
第七季 第六集
Do you want me to sit here?
No, here is fine.
You're Kristen Balko?
Yes.
And you're VP of Information Security at Running Milk?
That's right.
Um, is this part of the test?
No, just the pre-test.
Think of this as a practice run.
We gather some background information,
then go over the questions you'll be asked.
You're gonna tell me the questions on the test before the test?
That's right.
Isn't that cheating?
Uh, no, it isn't like the movies, Ms. Balko.
There are no "Gotcha moments""
You'll know every question beforehand.
Okay, got it.
Fire away.
Have you ever shared confidential materials
with individuals not employed with Running Milk?
No, never.
Am I supposed to answer?
Anything you want.
Have you ever stolen anything from your workplace?
Never.
Have you ever lied to the company?
No.
I lied.
You did steal materials from the workplace?
No, I lied by saying I never lied to the company.
Could you be more specific?
When I applied, in my resume,
I told them that I worked as a VP of Information Technology
at a previous company.
But there was no VP of Information Technology.
Oh, that's it?
Yes, what do you mean?
They fired you because you said you were a VP
on your resume?
No, they fired me because I lied in the lie detector test.
But that wasn't the point of the lie detector test, right?
They were trying to find someone who stole confidential materials.
Right.
And you didn't do that.
Did you try to explain that to your boss?
Yes, but they said I lied to the company,
so they could fire me.
That's why I'm suing.
Silicon Valley's a very provincial town.
I can't get a job anywhere.
Well, The Polygraph Protection Act
keeps an employer from forcing you to take a lie detector test,
but there are exceptions.
Theft.
Uh, Kristen, this is our investigator Jason.
Hi. But I didn't steal anything.
Yes, but it was the reason for the polygraph.
They caught you in another lie, but...
They need corroborating evidence.
Right.
And they couldn't have fired her
unless they already had some evidence that she lied on her resume?
Did they, Kristen?
Have evidence I lied?
No, I don't think so.
The whole point of the polygraph was about this theft.
Okay, um, why don't you give us the day to think about it?
Actually, I don't have a day.
Mr. Canning told me you'd be able to move faster than he could.
Louis Canning?
Yes.
He already filed the suit,
but he got busy with another case,
and he thought you'd be good to take it over.
I'm sure he did.
All right, I will see if they have any corroborating evidence.
Good, a polygraph can't be the sole basis for firing.
So what-- cap my work off at five hours?
Yeah.
Okay.
So, what did you find out about insurance?
Oh, yeah. Malpractice insurance is a fortune,
but we could bundle it.
I can get a rider to your homeowner's policy,
and just split the increase in your premium?
Will the coverage extend to Jason?
No, he's a freelancer.
I don't think it's a problem.
Did you know he used to be a lawyer?
No.
He practiced in New Jersey.
He was disbarred for a criminal conviction.
He punched a judge.
He punched a judge?
Yep.
Why?
I guess he didn't like his decision.
And you're worried about the insurance?
Yeah, if Jason beats up someone on the job...
Yeah, well, due diligence.
We should find out what happened.
Okay, I'm gonna call New Jersey.
See if I can talk to the judge.
What's up, Eli?
What's the best thing about Peter?
Excuse me?
I need a quote from you for Peter's bio.
Do you need it to be true?
True adjacent.
Peter's motto is "Service above self.
"My family has benefitted from it, now America can."
Eli, that's...
I know, it's nauseating. Help me out.
Eli?
Over here.
Just a second, Alicia.
I thought this was a staff meeting.
It is.
Turn off your cell phone
and I'll turn off mine.
What is it?
An Alabama Slammer.
Yeah. I like them strong.
Confusion to our enemies.
So, what are we discussing, Ruth?
What makes Eli Gold tick?
Uh, I know how this works, Ruth.
Unless you're trying to seduce me, which I very much doubt,
you get me drunk, you pretend to be drunk
and you find out more about me
than I find out about you.
Oh, Eli, you're too suspicious.
You're a new tree in my forest.
I want to know more about that tree, that's all.
Because unless I chop it down,
that tree's now part of my life.So...
My grandfather, Samuel Gold,
was a teamster organizer in Brooklyn.
Everything I learned, I learned from him.
I remember going to visit him in his office when I was little.
All the people coming to kiss his ring.
Looking for advice, for help.
And he told me
that the most powerful men are the ones that no one knows exist.
Is something funny?
Oh, yeah. What?
None of that was true.
Your grandfather was Ira Goldstein,
owner of a schmatta business in Queens.
He died a pauper after his brother-in-law cheated him
out of a uniform consignment with the NYPD.
And that quote?
You changed it.
It's from The Usual Suspects.
So, what do you want, Ruth?
Why are you pretending to care about me?
We got new internals from this afternoon.
Peter made another four point bump.
That's more than a fluke, that's a trend.
We broke through. We have a shot.
And not just at the vice presidency.
We could win.
Things turn sour for Hillary--
the e-mails, the next thing they throw at her-- we win.
But we need to be rowing in the same direction.
This goes the way we all want,
they'll be enough to carve up for both of us.
You see that, right?
I do.
So the strategy's changed.
We're not being kind and deferential to the frontrunner.
We're acting like the frontrunner.
We're not aiming for the vice presidency.
We're aiming for the presidency.
So, what do you need from me?
We're moving up the announcement to Thursday.
We want to take advantage of the momentum.
You need Alicia?
Yes, much more than we originally agreed.
Voters need to see these two together.
Young, vibrant, looking toward the future.
Jackie O to his JFK.
We need to work together, Eli.
You need to trust me.
And I need to trust you.
Who's that?
I don't know. Silicon Valley lawyer?
Hello. Alice Florrick, yes?
Yes.
Andrea Stevens.
It's so nice to meet you.
I was told you were the opposing counsel.
It just makes it so much more exciting
when you respect the opposition, don't you think?
It does.
Hello.
Hi. Lucca Quinn.
Hi. I love your hair.
How many years are you out of law school, Lucca?
A few.
Well, that's better than less than a few.
All rise.
Oh, here we go.
Court is now in session.
Lucca, if you ever want any advice.
Good afternoon.
I've read your preliminary motions.
I would like to take up the, uh, jurisdictional question.
Your Honor, the plaintiff lives in Chicago...
Your Honor, the question isn't about whether she lives in Chicago.
Your Honor, I was warned about Chicago courtrooms,
but I didn't think it was gonna be about who shouted the loudest.
It isn't, Counselor.
What do you have?
Thank you, Your Honor.
This is rank forum shopping.
Mrs. Florrick knows this case belongs in California.
Running Milk has no Chicago offices.
And the lie detector test in question
took place in California.
Kristen Balko lives in Chicago.
And thanks to the cloud tax
passed by the Chicago City Council,
Running Milk's offices are both in California and Illinois.
Yes, but respectfully, Your Honor,
they are not physically in Illinois.
But as Running Milk and its ilk have constantly reminded us:
"Brick and mortar are things of the past.
The cloud is the future."
Your Honor, so many of our witnesses will have to be
flown in from San Jose and that doesn't...
And so many of our witnesses will have to be flown in from Chicago...
Your Honor, to refute these...
Thank you.
But as Ms. Stevens pointed out,
this shouldn't be about who shouts the loudest.
Motion is denied.
We'll hear the case here.
Please have the Running Milk software spec
sent to me by end of day,
Thank you.
Just the first skirmish.
在法庭外用拳头猛击法官
Peter wants to be president.
Excuse me?
Peter thinks he can be president.
I need a drink.
Do you want one?
No, I need to go.
They moved the announcement up to Thursday.
You need to be in Springfield.
I wrote you a speech; very Michelle Obama.
What time Thursday?
3:00 p.M.
They'll need us more than usual.
They keep mixing their metaphors.
You're either Michelle Obama or Jackie O.
Do you ever wonder why I'm hearing this from you
and not Peter?
What? No.
What do you mean?
Well, I'm hearing that Peter truly is running for president
and that I might be First Lady from his campaign manager.
I am not his campaign manager.
You think he has a chance?
I don't know.
I thought Trump would self-destruct,
So what do I know?
Primaries are their own insanity.
What are you making?
A margarita.
Tequila, triple sec.
You judging me?
No.
That sounded like a judgmental huh.
No.
You get as sloppy drunk as you want to.
So, what do they want me to do?
Be involved. Go on Thursday.
Give a good speech. Look First Lady-like.
I got Frank Landau to introduce you.
It's not bad having the head of the Democratic committee
say nice things about you.
What are you doing, Eli?
This doesn't sound like you.
Sure it does.
This is what I sound like.
No, no, no, no.
You're scheming something here.
Cheers.
Hey, I've got some good news and I got some bad news--
which do you want first?
Bad.
Good.
Running Milk's HR team
definitely verified Kristen lied on her resume?
Damn.
So we have no case.
What's the good news?
I don't think there was a theft at Running Milk.
What do you mean?
A firm like Running Milk is required to notify
their customers of any breach; they didn't.
California attorney general's got
no record of any breach at Running Milk.
So they had no reason to polygraph.
非法程序[毒树]获得的证据[果]不得采纳
Right, fruit of the poisonous tree.
Why'd you punch that judge?
I was angry.
Why were you angry?
Don't you get angry?
I do, but I don't punch people.
Maybe you should start.
As you can see, Your Honor,
Running Milk never suffered a security breach,
and since that was the only legal justification
for polygraphing our client,
that polygraph must be thrown out.
Is this true?
Can you give me one second, Your Honor?
As you requested,
uh, the CEO of Running Milk
flew in a great personal expense.
I'm honored.
Without admitting to any wrongdoing, Your Honor,
Running Milk generously agrees to
rehire the plaintiff at her original salary.
We just want this to be over.
Really? Since when?
Since an hour ago.
We ask that this suit be dismissed, Your Honor.
Your Honor, if our client is rehired,
she can't be subjected to a new polygraph, is that correct?
Yes, private employers are barred
from making polygraphs a condition of employment.
May we have a ruling on that, Your Honor?
Um, can... I'm-I'm sorry, can I just have one more second, Your Honor?
Actually, polygraphs may be applied
to employees engaged in counterintelligence
or national security functions,
pursuant to a contract with the federal government.
Your Honor, our client has no connection with national security.
And again I ask for a ruling.
These contracts show
that Running Milk has ongoing accounts with the government.
This makes no sense.
If these contracts were the reason for these polygraph tests,
then why create the fiction of a security breach?
Are we really wondering why the National Security Agency
might have a need for secrecy?
Your Honor, the defendant just plans
to rehire our client so they can fire her again.
Yes, but legally.
These contracts appear in order.
Before Miss Balko starts work again,
she'll need to submit to a polygraph.
Your Honor.
I don't have time for this, Eli.
Even for a friend?
If you're wearing a wire,
you have to tell me, or it'll be thrown out in court.
I am not wearing a wire.
I need your help.
I would never have taken that bribe.
I didn't need you to warn me.
But I did warn you.
What? What do you need?
Information on Frank Landau
and his manipulation of voting machines in the last election.
No, I won't betray him.
He won't know it's you.
I just need the proof from you, and I'll do the rest.
What are you up to?
Please hold.
Lockhart, Agos & Lee.
Lockhart, Agos & Lee.
Please hold.
Monica Timmons?
You won't mind working at a big law firm?
No, I think I'd like the challenge.
Where are you from originally?
Maryland.
Oh, Maryland.
Baltimore?
Yes.
Tough neighborhood.
No.
Loyola.
We don't see many applicants
from that law school.
I think it's underrated, actually.
Professor Edmund Kindle, who clerked for Justice Kennedy...
Never heard of him.
He's a fantastic scholar.
He was my mentor.
How nice.
Thanks for coming in.
We don't get to see many black lawyers in here.
How old are you, honey?
Twenty-six.
What, are you, uh, Nigerian, or what?
What.
Hey, you're a sassy one, aren't you?
I try to be.
Let me ask you a question
that I ask all the summer interns.
If you were on a desert island...
I'm glad you came in today, Monica.
I'm glad I did, too.
We need fighters in here.
So you're from Maryland?
Yes.
Baltimore?
That's right.
You have to be tough to grow up there?
Monica Timmons, I like her.
No, easy pass.
I know she didn't go to a top-tier law school.
Top tier? Loyola barely made it to second tier.
I like Monica, too,
but I do worry about her LSATs.
I thought you wanted new talent, Cary.
Yeah, and we have it
in Brian, John Michael and, um...
the other one.
You mean the three that looked like you?
That has nothing to do with it.
We need some diversity.
These three are the top at this firm,
Every young face
of their classes.
looks like every other one.
Excuse me.
Uh, I'm for the black girl.
I'm gonna regret this,
but is there a reason you want to hire a candidate
significantly less qualified than the others?
She's black, she's suffered, like my people.
We don't hire on the basis of race, Howard.
Thought we were on the same side.
You are on the same side.
You're both for dipping.
We are not in for dipping.
This isn't about dipping.
Yes... that's the truth.
You want to dip our standards.
Your Honor, as much as I appreciate the opposition's passion,
you have already validated our governmental contracts,
so I'm not sure why...
Yes, but the mere existence
of those contracts does not mean
that our client was engaged in such work.
I'm not sure I understand.
Can you name which of her projects falls
但不禁止使用测谎仪
under the EPPA exception?
Your Honor, uh...
I am stunned at the cynicism on display here.
Mrs. Florrick knows
my client's contracts preclude me from going into detail.
No one here has security clearance to hear the details.
So we just have to trust you.
No, you have to trust the United States government.
Running Milk has already misled this court.
Yes, but this isn't about Running Milk anymore.
This is about national security.
So the polygraph will proceed.
Hey, you did your best.
I want our announcement to echo Obama's in every way.
We've got the steps of the Old State Capitol building,
same as Obama.
Gene, I want the same overcoat for Peter.
I mean the exact same one that Obama wore--
and Alicia, too.
The whole point, people, is to get the press
to put the two photos side-by-side.
Obama and Peter.
Sorry to interrupt.
Thank you for your enthusiasm.
Let's not jinx those polls.
Okay, so, um, this race is in flux,
and I can tell you that because I feel it
out there on the trail, and it's because
of all the hard work we've been doing,
but now we have to double down.
I want every voter in this country to see
who I am, where I'm from,
and why I'm doing this.
Thank you again.
No luck with Leahy or Durbin?
Uh, they're endorsing Hillary.
We could go with a state senator.
Well, that makes it too much of an Illinois affair.
There is one idea we could try.
Eli, could you step in here a minute?
Mr. Governor.
Well, I'm glad to see
that you two are working so well together.
Oh, we had our datente drink.
Um, Eli wanted Frank Landau to introduce Alicia.
It's a good idea-- he's well respected in Democratic circles,
and Eli wrote him an excellent speech.
Sounds good.
But I'm wondering if Landau would be better
to introduce you, Mr. Governor.
If you'd be all right with that.
Of course, I'm here to serve.
I've seen Landau speak.
He gives a true barnburner.
She stole Landau from you.
How is it you can lurk
in an office the size of a phone booth?
Ruth stole Landau from you
and yet you seem happy, Eli.
What's that about?
I'm a good person.
No.
You're setting Peter up.
I want to be left alone with my thoughts.
I thought you wanted to destroy Ruth, not Peter.
Sometimes to stop the cancer,
you have to endanger the patient.
Oh, my God.
You're like an evil scientist.
What are you endangering Peter with?
Landau rigged the voting machines in the last election.
He'll have his arm around Peter
at the biggest moment of his career.
That'll leave a mark.
Hello?
Judge Hess.
Alicia Florrick.
Thank you taking the time to speak with me.
Certainly. You said you had some questions
about Jason Crouse?
I do. I'm conducting background checks on private investigators.
Yes, I'd heard he moved to Chicago.
I was wondering if you could shed some light
on the incident that got him disbarred.
Are you thinking of hiring him, ma'am?
We are.
Well, then I have a few words of advice.
Do you have a pen?
I do.
No, no, no, no, no.
And no.
He's a ticking time bomb.
He will smile, he will tell you jokes,
and you'll even think you're dealing with a normal person,
then he'll explode when you least expect it.
Um, that was several years ago.
Yes.
Have you read the book The Sociopath Next Door?
I haven't.
One out of every 25 people are sociopaths.
They don't have the gene that leads to compassion.
They can fake being a normal person,
but deep down, they aren't.
They may not murder, they may not rape,
but they will eat away your life from the inside.
That is Jason Crouse.
And my advice to you, ma'am, is run.
But did you participate in Go Pro?
Yes, everyone did.
And did you have a passion project?
Kristen and her coworkers were encouraged
to have side projects,
and there's a chance that one of these side projects
was the reason she got fired.
Well, I was working on a relationship-mapping app.
Sorry, what... what is that?
It's a way to create diagrams of relationships
between concepts, ideas, people and other pieces of information.
I found a way to cross-platform on JavaScript
for an app I called Spoiler.
What's Spoiler?
It analyzes the pilot episode of a new TV series
and predicts stuff about the story,
like who will sleep with who and who will get killed off.
So it's predictive.
Yes. Why?
Did anyone say it might be used by the NSA?
No, it's a stupid little program.
It's not for surveillance.
Where are you going?
To talk to someone.
What's so secret you couldn't talk on the phone?
I need to get in touch with an old client of ours.
I think he gave you information on how to contact him?
It's complicated.
What isn't?
All right.
Hello?
Um, I'm a friend of Cary's.
You said to call if there was anything we needed.
Where are you?
Chicago.
All right, did you do everything?
Everything Cary said.
Can I come out from under the blanket now?
Did you type the number in under the blanket?
Yes.
Then yes.
Uh, what do you need?
I need your help.
When you say potential, Diane, what you're really talking....
Just ask me what I'm talking about.
You're talking about the future of this firm.
Yes, and Monica is the kind of attorney
I see in our future.
New-law.
That is where our future lies,
in companies like Three-Tech.
The 3-D printing company?
Their billable hours are laughable.
So were Chumhum's, when they first started out.
We need people like Brian and John Michael and Ray.
And I think we should vote.
I vote for the black girl.
Well, you don't get a vote, Howard.
You're not a name partner.
I'm on the hiring committee.
You volunteered for the hiring committee
when you were thinking about suing.
Ah, ridiculous.
Okay... Cary.
I will vote for the guy
who interned at Silicon Systems...
Brian. Right.
And, David, I will agree
to the automaton
with the perfect LSATs...
Billy Bob.
That's not his name.
The two-named guy.
...if you will both agree
to support Monica.
I'm sorry, Diane.
I just can't.
Then what will work for you, David?
Hiring the three
most highly qualified candidates.
Three white guys.
Two from Harvard, one from Stanford.
Yup.
Do you agree?
I liked Monica, Diane.
I really did, but...
She doesn't look like you, right?
That's not fair.
A lot of things that aren't fair are true.
Your Honor, at some point your ruling must be honored.
This is not about your ruling...
They want to play a video
without telling us from whom.
This is a matter of some delicacy--
and national security--
and we believe, for the safety of the person on the video,
advance notice places him at unnecessary
and unacceptable risk.
Who is it?
Your Honor, I'm being genuine, here.
I don't want to imperil the man
who was brave enough to...
Give me a name.
Jeff Dellinger.
They want to hear testimony
from a disgraced, poor man's Snowden?
And I want to hear it.
We'll view it in chambers
and then I'll decide whether to admit it into evidence.
Spoiler has been one of the NSA's
most exciting civilian acquisitions,
and although it was created for rather banal reasons,
the same infrastructure
lends itself well to processing other forms of data.
Like understanding conversations between potential terrorists
and predicting their future plots.
You know, like if, uh, one terrorist is going to get into
a love triangle with another terrorist's wife.
Just kidding.
Sort of.
The NSA has spent millions of dollars
to secure the Spoiler app.
And, in my experience,
the agency and their partners
will do a... a lot
to protect that kind of investment.
Your Honor,
Running Milk continues to mislead this court.
They sold an app to the government--
an app my client created--
then terminated her
to prevent her stock options from vesting,
so she wouldn't share in the profit of her own invention.
This testimony proves nothing.
They're asking the court to take the word of a man
disciplined by the NSA
before fleeing to a non-extradition country.
Mr. Dellinger has a vendetta against the NSA.
That's all this proves.
Can we get Mr. Dellinger in here?
Given the NSA's reach,
I couldn't ask him to put himself at that risk.
I understand. And I sympathize.
But if there isn't any insoluble,
physical reason that Mr. Dellinger can't testify in person,
well, I have to agree with Ms., uh...
Stevens.
I'm sorry, but I don't see you getting out of that polygraph.
Good luck.
What?
Are you kidding me? Eli!
We lost the Old State Capitol building.
What? How?
There's an inter-faith
break dancing competition on the steps.
Are you kidding me?
We need the parallel to Obama.
We need the...
Well, it's not just any steps.
It's the town hall steps!
The advance team.
They're suggesting the steps to the local gym.
The local...
They say they look the same.
It doesn't matter if they look the same.
It's a gym!
Did Lincoln exercise there?
Did he talk about a house divided while on the treadmill?
Then why are we there?
Not bad.
Are those crosses?
No, decorative "X"S.
Oh, with a decorative Jesus?
Why are there crosses?
It's a Catholic gym.
A Catholic gym? Is that a thing?
A gym at a Catholic school.
You swear you can get the steps?
Okay, then tie them down.
And see if you can get the break dancers to move.
You're not screwing with me, are you, Eli?
This hurts both of us.
Okay, we cover up the crosses with a banner.
Have people on the steps.
He comes up through the crowd.
It could look like the Obama announcement.
I found what you were looking for.
What are you doing here?
Better than you coming to my office.
Don, if you are recording me, and I ask,
you have to acknowledge it
or the recording cannot be used in a court of law.
Are you recording me?
No, Eli.
Here's your proof.
The man who arranged the hack
of the voting machines last March,
he's an old stooge of Frank Landau's.
And he'll talk?
He'll talk to a reporter
if they protect him under the shield laws.
Okay, I need him on Thursday.
Landau will introduce the governor.
Then I need this report to come out.
He'll pin it on Landau?
Definitely.
Landau and Peter.
Excuse me?
He'll pin it on Landau and Peter.
Peter Florrick?
Yes.
What's wrong?
But Peter had nothing to do with the hack.
Yes, he did.
He was worried about his wife losing,
so he set it up.
What's wrong?
This is good, Eli.
You wanted to hobble the governor, right?
Well, this will knock him out.
Right.
So Thursday, right?
You want him to drop the bomb
just after Landau intros Peter?
Forget everything that you've ever
heard or seen on television.
Attempts to manipulate the data output are futile.
So what do I do?
Manipulate the person reading the data.
Any deviation from your baseline stress level,
doesn't make the needle go all crazy.
It's the polygrapher's job to figure out what they mean.
So, while the machine may be objective,
the polygrapher's not.
He's the key.
So what do you want me to do, flirt with him?
I want you to throw him off his game.
Start by asking a bunch of questions.
And then what?
Confess before the test starts.
About my resume?
No, about everything else.
Every mistake you've ever made,
every lie you've ever told.
Convince him that
you are unburdening yourself, being truthful.
It'll make him want to give you the benefit of the doubt.
And, remember, doubt is your friend.
You don't have to come up as truthful.
Inconclusive works for you here.
All right. Are you ready?
This is... I'm...
I'm so honored you'd bring me back
for a second interview.
Monica, actually,
I'm afraid this isn't a second interview.
Uh, the firm won't be able to extend you an offer.
What?
Associate hiring is extremely competitive, as you know.
We've seen dozens of eminently qualified candidates and, uh...
well, I'm afraid you came up short.
We're happy to have you.
Most firms would have sent a form letter.
Why drag me in here?
Because I...
I want you to know
I think you're a stellar young woman,
one with a very promising future.
And if I can be of any help, please call.
You brought me in here
to say you want to help me...
but not to give me a job?
Okay. Thanks.
This was most illuminating.
What is this place?
It's a neutral, third-party location.
They said the polygrapher would meet us here.
Hello. I'll be administering your test today.
I'll be asking you questions,
then observing you for truthfulness.
Is this a joke?
I analyze 50 different measurements in real time,
including basal body temperature,
retinal movement, and vocal stress.
I'm Multiple Input Lie Detection.
MILD, for short.
Hello?
Hey, it's Mr. Gutierrez.
Did things work out for your client?
Actually, no.
They've gotten worse, Mr. Gutierrez.
Wait. Is it my fault?
No. My client submitted for another polygraph,
but it turned out to be one of those new high-tech machines.
MILD?
You're familiar with it.
Yeah, those Homeland Security pinheads
always think systems like that are cutting-edge.
Avatar, Sberbank.
You wouldn't happen to know any way we could...
beat it?
Uh, sorry, no.
But I mean, it can't be too difficult.
It's a bucket of bolts.
We'd love to get some insight.
Uh, let me see what I can pull together.
Welcome back, Mrs. Florrick.
The water's fine.
Actually, Mom, that was my witness.
What, why? Grace, what's going on?
She sounds stressed.
That was not stress.
Why is she at home?
It's middle of a workday.
Maybe her firm tanked.
That's distressing.
If she were stressed,
it would be because she is not over
what's-his-face being shot.
Do you think we can get authorization?
To keep up the three-hop?
Yeah.
Maybe if we use this data.
I just sent you a file.
Goats? No more goats!
Wait for it, wait for it.
How long?
23 seconds.
Fainting goats.
My God, it's like day school.
Let's go, everyone, status meeting.
Uh-oh, firings.
What do you mean?
The changes in the Patriot Act.
They take place at the end of the month--
they're not gonna need all of us anymore.
Are you kidding me?!
I just moved into a new apartment.
Maybe it'll be the guys in software.
They're always screwing off.
I know you're all anxious to hear
about the changes around here.
As you probably all know
we can no longer collect bulk telephone data.
I know, it's a bit of a shift.
But we're taking this as good news.
Okay, here we go-- their good news is our bad.
FISA will still grant us three-hop targeting
of our most important cases,
so none of you are going to lose your jobs.
Excuse me?
Yes, you heard me.
The reforms in the Patriot Act will force us
to be more focused, that's all.
All of our tools are still in place.
Of course, it will mean more paperwork.
Seriously, I just saved your jobs,
and now you're complaining about paperwork.
Uh, Mr. Foyle?
We've been tracking Dellinger,
and he called Alicia Florrick.
What was the subject?
No threat, just talk of a case.
Her husband's running for president.
Yes, but we've been tracking everyone else that Dellinger called.
Okay, do this.
You can track her for 48 hours.
Find me a connection between Mrs. Florrick
and another brown-level target
and I get you a green light.
Brown level, seriously?
Take yes for an answer.
Thank you, sir.
Don't see many black lawyers in here.
How old are you, honey?
洛&艾&李律所隐藏摄像头拍摄
What are you-- uh, Nigerian or what?
Thanks for coming in, but I think I should warn you
that we have a sort of Lockhart/Agos/Lee type here
and you're not really it.
We've had some African-Americans here before
not in all positions
but we are open to all types and all backgrounds.
No, no, you're exactly the kind of diversity we want
at Lockhart/Agos/Lee.
We've seen dozens of eminently qualified candidates,
and, um, well...
you just came up short.

Cary!
Hello?
Hey, it's Lucca.
I got some good news on Jason.
Really?
Yeah, I spoke to a guy that witnessed the fight with the judge.
Uh, what'd he say?
He said there was some pushing and some shoving,
some raised voices,
but he said the judge walked out of Callahan,
this bar near the courthouse,
without a scrape on him.
Judge Hess drew a very different picture.
You spoke with the judge?
Yes.
He made it sound like
Jason beat him within an inch of his life.
That's probably Kristen.
I have to get down to Springfield.
How close are you?
I'll be less than five.
Okay.
What?
We can't be on the steps.
The fire department says they need reinforcement,
and we don't have it.
Let me get this straight.
We couldn't announce on the Springfield steps,
because they're having a square dancing contest.
Break dancing competition.
Interfaith break dancing competition.
So we move to the steps of a gym because they look similar.
But now the fire department says we can't announce there,
because they'll collapse?!
Or lean aggressively.
So, where does that leave us?
Inside of the gym?
Yes.
Did Lincoln do anything here?
No, sir.
Did Obama do anything here?
Not to our knowledge, sir.
Would you mind putting this on, sir?
Why?
It matches Obama's.
Yes, because he announced
outside in 12-degree weather.
I'm announcing in an 89-degree gym.
Yes, but it won't look that way on TV.
No, but I'll be sweating like a hog.
We'll put some fans up there to cool you down.
And here's your scarf.
Oh, Mr. Landau, hello.
Ruth.
Frank.
So glad you could do this for us.
Well, I'm honored to be a part of it.
Just sorry we couldn't get the Obama location
in the Old Capitol building.
As am I.
But, uh, here we have the common touch.
Yes, and the common smell.
I think that's gym socks.
In a few hours, Peter Florrick is expected
to take the stage here in Springfield
伊利诺伊州 斯普林菲尔德
to announce his candidacy for president.
So, are you gonna destroy him?
Why don't you close the door?
So...
are you going to destroy him, Krishna?
If I destroy Peter, I destroy her.
Ruth?
No, Alicia.
She doesn't know Peter had her voting machines hacked.
But he did it for her.
Yeah, but then he hung her out to dry.
Then what's your plan?
...jobs and most importantly national security...
I have no idea.
You're absolutely right.
All that and more coming up next.
I commend your ingenuity and your chutzpah.
Maybe if I'd put that in the special skills section
of my resume? I'd have a job.
Monica, I'm not saying our world today is enlightened.
Far from it.
But starting out as a woman in a big law firm 30 years ago,
let's just say I empathize.
Everyone has to eat dirt on the way up.
The only difference is the kind...
Are you seriously comparing histories?
Yes, I am.
If you chose to lay on your back
for a male partner or two,
just to get ahead, that was your choice.
Excuse me?
I don't choose to have women hold their purses tighter,
when they see me coming down the street.
I don't choose for cops to drag me out of my car and frisk me
just for failing to signal.
I'm not trying to equate...
Yes, you are.
And there is no comparison.
I don't want your understanding.
I don't need your advice.
What I need is a job.
It was from Springfield
that Abraham Lincoln announced his candidacy for president.
It was from Springfield that Barack Obama
announced his candidacy for president.
And it is from Springfield where our next great president
will hail as well!
He understands the challenges...
Oh, my God, I'm burning up.
I'm like a wet seal with sweat.
Hold on.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Yeah, you can't buy moments like that.
Why are you so cynical?
And you may remember this photo
of the president and First Lady on the day of his announcement.
It's fun.
What?
Ladies and gentlemen,
Peter Florrick!
Well done, Frank.
Go on.
Thank you, Frank!
Well, I'm gonna make this brief.
Today I'm announcing my candidacy
for the Democratic nomination
for the President of the United States of America!
How's that for plain speaking?
Well, let me just tell you I couldn't do it
without this woman by my side.
Alicia!
Oh, cool air.
Thank you.
I think you all know my wonderful wife.
With you all the way!
Hello?
Oh, Mrs. Florrick, how are you?
You must be in Springfield.
Yes, sorry it's so loud.
Oh, I hear it's going well.
I'm really happy for you and your husband.
Yes, uh, there are a dozen supporters
staring at me right now.
Good for you.
Yes, I'm gonna tell them about Spoiler.
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, what?
Jeff Dellinger is willing to talk.
So is Kristen.
Well, that's exciting.
What do you think will happen to Running Milk
stock prices when the world finds out
they're in bed with the NSA?
Okay, just-just wait, h-hold on.
Amend the suit.
What?
Have Kristen sue for gender discrimination
and we'll settle.
They'd rather be seen as sexist
than in bed with the next Edward Snowden?
Of course they would, Alicia.
Don't be naive. $1.2 million.
Take it to your client and we'll have a nice little chat.
She just said Snowden.
What?
Alicia Florrick.
She just said Snowden.
The next Snowden.
What was the context?
It doesn't matter the context. She said it.
He's a brown target.
That's our second connection.
We can start listening to her again.
We just found our backdoor.
We just found our back...
Dude, what is this?
Goats singing, "I Will Always Love You."
