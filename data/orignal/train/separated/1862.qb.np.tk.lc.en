we &apos;ve all heard the same .
it &apos;s one of those things we &apos;ve learned
in seventh grade science class .
&quot; adapt or die . &quot;
i ... don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s two words :
no sex .
i &apos;m sure there should be more words .
if you &apos;re gonna choose chief resident ,
you have to be impartial .
come on . this ? now ?
sex with me , however hot and excellent ,
could cloud your judgment .
this is blackmail is it what it is .
no , it is not . final interviews are today ,
and coincidentally , i am on your service .
coincidentally .
well , since teddy &apos;s shutting me out of cardio ,
where i can show my stuff , i &apos;m gonna show it to you .
so today you &apos;ll see me
not as your naked and desirable wife ,
but as a focused , organized , efficient , and deserving candidate
who &apos;s getting in the shower .
no . i &apos;ll come with you .
no . no , no . no clouding .
owen , this hurts me more than it hurts you .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
i know .
adapting isn &apos;t easy , though .
you have to fight your competition ,
fend off their attacks ,
and sometimes , you have to kill .
good morning .
you &apos;re meeting with owen this morning , right ?
yeah .
you &apos;re not gonna say anything
about me or the trial , right ?
you know , i thought you were gonna say something
like &quot; good luck , &quot;
but i guess it &apos;s every freakin &apos; man for himself , huh ?
you do what you need to do to survive .
but tell him that you were instrumental
in getting the chief &apos;s trial approved
for phase 1 human testing-- from mice to humans .
i &apos;m not doing that .
well , okay , i know , you don &apos;t like bragging about yourself ,
but you don &apos;t even have to brag .
i mean , your diabetes trial does it for you .
it &apos;s gonna win every award . seriously .
just make sure that he knows that you--
i got it .
that you have been instrumental--
got it .
he don &apos;t got it .
i got it .
i got the job at baylor .
over 50 applicants , i ... i got it .
that &apos;s awesome .
well , um , i don &apos;t know . i mean--
it &apos;s in texas .
there are a lot of factors to consider , right ?
yeah , but it &apos;s what you wanted .
it &apos;s , it &apos;s a great program .
well , i @-@ i mean , i was thinking
of sticking around here for another year--
crap . oh , i gotta go .
i gotta prep for my meeting with hunt .
besides , if i &apos;m here when you win chief resident ,
you &apos;ll still have a friend .
look , we all get it &apos;s not personal .
i mean , it &apos;s a--it &apos;s a competition .
sometimes , you gotta be a shark .
congratulations on baylor .
huh ? you see ?
sorry i &apos;m late . i was cramming .
what , for hunt ?
no .
you got that in the bag .
no , i &apos;m more worried
about the interview with the social worker .
don &apos;t laugh at me , derek .
nothing in my life has prepared me for this .
my mother was about as nurturing as a steak knife .
i don &apos;t know anything about making
lunches or halloween costumes .
good moms make halloween costumes .
well , you can sew .
i sew skin .
yeah . see ? it &apos;s gonna be fine .
it &apos;s just instinct , right ?
here you go . there you go . oh , there you go .
okay . okay . oh .
she looks good . her weight &apos;s up ,
and , uh , her previous incisions have healed .
the labs are within normal limits ...
and she &apos;s super @-@ duper cute , aren &apos;t you ?
okay . so it &apos;s an uncomplicated hernia .
so you don &apos;t have to use any artificial closures , right ?
yeah , no . no , it &apos;s really simple .
good .
i &apos;ll do a short incision in her suprapubic crease
to do a traditional exposure , and then i &apos;ll ...
finish with a ...
chupo .
oh , god . i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s what callie calls a pacifier .
but zola hasn &apos;t eaten because of the surgery .
she &apos;s probably hungry .
you might want to try to soothe her with the pacifier .
come here , baby . come here , little baby .
chupo . oh , yes . there you go . ooh .
chupo .
all right . i &apos;ll call you when i &apos;m ready to come take her up .
see ? we &apos;ll figure it out .
are you excited ?
it &apos;s been a month , abena . you ready to go home ?
i snagged some extra hydroxyurea .
wait , wait , wait .
you forgot something .
you need to take that at home , okay ?
along with your antibiotics .
it &apos;s gonna help with the sickle cell symptoms ,
and the attacks will be less severe when they happen .
thank you .
i &apos;ll make sure she takes it .
now you have sickle cell , lebo ,
so you need to make sure you take some , too .
yes , ma &apos;am .
promise me ?
yes , dr. alex .
oh . and don &apos;t forget
you both have to have your blood counts
monitored at the clinic , even if you feel fine .
i will , just as you told me . i promise .
thank you . thank you for helping my sister .
thank you so much .
are you in pain , lebo ?
no , no , i am fine . we have to go .
dr. bailey .
well , maybe we should check you out .
she &apos;ll miss the plane . it &apos;s no trouble .
i &apos;m fine .
okay . wait , hold--
gurney !
oh . okay , okay , okay .
how about her ?
she &apos;s smiling . who smiles when they go for a run ?
happy people .
happiness is overrated .
what about you ?
shouldn &apos;t what &apos;s his name
be off to save the world pretty soon ?
what &apos;s his name is taking a break from world saving .
he was offered a permanent position at landstuhl , so--
on your left .
oh , watch out .
it &apos;s a u.s. military hospital in germany ,
and he leaves in a week .
that &apos;s great .
he asked me to go with him .
you okay ?
uh , yeah .
i mean , i @-@ i really-- i like him .
i @-@ i feel like things could be good with us .
that &apos;s just crazy , right ?
i mean , besides , i have too many obligations here .
i &apos;m in the middle of my contract ,
i @-@ i have residents to teach , i have you .
okay . you just listed me as an obligation .
no . that--that &apos;s not what i meant . i mean , no , you &apos;re not--
no , i get it . like i &apos;m dead weight .
i &apos;m an anchor , dragging you down .
no , stop .
i &apos;m horrible .
that &apos;s--no . i @-@ i ...
if i move , it might cause you insurance headaches .
i &apos;m just saying that we would sort of--
we would just have to sort it out .
okay .
okay .
what about her ?
yeah , if a unibrow was my thing , i &apos;d be all over that .
you &apos;re hopeless .
what do you got ?
17 @-@ year @-@ old pregnant female with syncopal episode outside the e.r.
look , she &apos;s got blood in her left lower quadrant .
could be a splenic rupture , but it &apos;s hard to tell .
abena ...
abena &apos;s fine . don &apos;t worry about her right now .
you need to worry about yourself .
you need to have surgery .
lebo ,
why didn &apos;t you tell us you were pregnant ?
you would &apos;ve said i cannot fly .
i had to be here for my sister .
is something wrong with my baby ?
i see a strong heartbeat ,
but there &apos;s not much fluid surrounding the baby ,
and he &apos;s very small for 32 weeks .
she &apos;s eight months along ?
yeah , i &apos;m gonna need to monitor this baby .
well , we need to take her to c.t. first
to see where the abdominal bleeding &apos;s coming from .
okay , i &apos;ll meet you in surgery .
she &apos;s barely breathing . i &apos;ll get an ambu .
i &apos;ve got blood hanging , but her b.p. &apos; s still dropping .
no time for a c.t.
all right , call up and get an o.r. ready .
it &apos;s based on a protocol used in aviation .
a simple checklist
has led to a huge drop in plane crashes .
&apos;cause it cuts down on human error .
exactly , and i thought instead of--
here you go .
thanks-- telling you about it in an interview ,
i &apos;d walk you through it .
so the checklist is the first page
on every patient clipboard so you can see at a glance
that mr. aranda has been checked in for coughing up blood ,
has been seen by a physician , has had a chest x @-@ ray ,
and those results have come back ,
so now we just need to get
a consent for bronchoscopy
to rule out cancer .
cancer ? he might have cancer ?
like grandpa had ?
he died .
whoa , whoa . what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i said &quot; rule out cancer . &quot;
there &apos;s a spot on your x @-@ ray
that we just need to take a closer look at
so that we can be sure that your dad &apos;s just fine .
just to be sure , okay ?
okay . so that &apos;s , uh ... update the patient .
dr. hunt , bed seven is admitted for observation ,
bed five is discharged , i put in a drain in bed nine ,
and i &apos;m reporting for further instruction .
you are organized .
and focused and efficient .
okay . well , mr. aranda here needs to
go up to bronchoscopy .
well , i &apos;ll take him .
oh , actually , no .
proper protocol is to page dr. altman .
she will schedule the bronchoscopy .
see ? it &apos;s right here on the checklist .
protocol . okay , so the next step
is the o.r. checklist .
mr. aranda , let &apos;s get you up to bronchoscopy .
oh , there &apos;s a lot of bleeding here .
uh , more suction .
where &apos;s the source ?
well , so far the spleen looks good .
just keep exploring .
uh , just a little more retraction there , please .
uh-- what &apos;s he doing there ?
nobody move . gown me . i &apos;m going in .
um , how did her baby get tangled up in her intestines ?
right over here .
the baby survived a full term outside of the uterus ?
yeah , it &apos;s extremely rare .
her tubes are scarred , so the fertilized egg
found a place to implant where it could continue to grow .
dr. baily , grab his foot
while i free him from these adhesions .
well , why didn &apos;t it show up on the ultrasound ?
believe it or not , it &apos;s missed about 50 % of the time .
keep suctioning . okay , he &apos;s coming out .
clamps to dr. robbins , please .
dr. karev , cut the cord and take him to get checked out .
okay , the blood in her abdomen
is from her placenta ripping apart .
we need to remove as much as possible .
be prepared for torrential hemorrhage . check the--
pressure &apos;s dropping .
damn it . clamps . zero vicryl .
we gotta stop this bleeding , or we &apos;re gonna lose her .
crossmatch six more units of r.b.c.s
and get them up here , stat .
alex , i don &apos;t hear that baby .
come on , buddy . give it up .
and i &apos;ve been doing some research on diabetes ,
and i heard you &apos;re starting a clinical trial .
i @-@ i &apos;d like to see if i could get on it .
well , the trial has very specific criteria .
i mean , the subjects have to remain impartial .
the fact that you &apos;re married to one of my attendings--
look , i know that you have never been wild
about the fact that teddy married me ,
but the truth is , i really like her ...
and not just for her insurance .
but she still sees me as a patient ,
as a--as an insurance sponge .
i need to get my own insurance ,
so in order to do that i need a job ,
and in order to get a job , it would be helpful
if i wasn &apos;t going into diabetic shock every five minutes .
hey , um , what &apos;s this ?
just a ... oh .
hey . hunt . uh , my knee replacement got canceled ,
and i need to break some bones .
aren &apos;t you supposed to mend them ?
well , it &apos;s my first day back , and i left my baby
for the first time since we got home .
i need to remember why i love being a surgeon so much
or i &apos;m afraid i will walk out of here and never come back .
it doesn &apos;t have to be big .
just a sprained ankle , hairline fracture , anything .
okay .
oh , my god . anytime i hear a baby cry ,
it makes me think of sofia .
they all sound like her .
wait . that really sounds like her .
what ? what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s bring your daughter to work day .
no , it &apos;s not .
i bathed her , changed her .
i fed her , i napped her .
hi . we read a book ,
played with that little hanging , jingling thing ...
and it was still only 11 : 30 .
i needed some adult contact .
please take this baby away from me .
sure .
i &apos;m serious . take her , mark .
okay .
oh , my god . oh , my god . this baby &apos;s crack .
she &apos;s a crack baby .
you shouldn &apos;t call her that .
torres . you &apos;re in luck .
motorcycle crash 20 minutes out .
yes . okay .
oh , i love you , but mommy &apos;s gotta go to work .
take her , mark .
give me the baby .
just physically lift her from my arms .
it &apos;s not that bad .
okay . i &apos;ll be right--
back--back you go .
okay .
lebo &apos;s bowel looks clean .
we got all the adhesions .
how &apos;s the baby ?
good . apgar score &apos;s 9 and 10 .
how &apos;s she doing ?
we got the bleeding under control
and removed the placenta ,
and we &apos;re about to close . she &apos;s gonna be just fine .
yeah , for now .
she &apos;s gonna go back there .
she won &apos;t get the follow @-@ up care that she needs .
once she and her sister run out of the sickle cell meds
we gave them ,
then what are they gonna do ?
the best they can .
what about the kid ?
he &apos;s probably a sickler , too .
who &apos;s gonna give him his vaccination ?
well , how about you , karev ?
what ?
you .
go there . go back with them .
the job at namboze clinic has never been filled .
they &apos;re looking for someone who &apos;s single , unattached ,
with minimum three years residency .
there &apos;s a med school loan forgiveness grant attached to it .
they &apos;ve already been coordinating with you .
i mean , they know you . you &apos;re kind of perfect .
well , that &apos;s pretty far to go for a follow @-@ up exam .
you &apos;d be great . i could take care of it with one call .
so you just think about it .
sir .
oh , avery . uh , that chart over there--henry burton--
needs to be screened .
if he meets the criteria , put him in line for phase 1 .
chief , i , um , i &apos;m sorry .
i need to step away from the trial .
you what ?
i appreciate the opportunity , i do ,
and i don &apos;t want to inconvenience you going forward--
i &apos;m not worried about me .
you were a big part of getting this thing where it is .
i don &apos;t know why you want to give it up .
well , that &apos;s very nice of you to say , sir .
but i feel like i need to focus on surgery right now .
you sure about this ?
respectfully , yes .
i am .
thank you , sir .
excellent work , dr. karev .
grey , just give me two seconds .
okay .
no , i didn &apos;t say anything .
but maybe you should if you &apos;re so worried about it ,
before somebody finds out .
no one is going to .
grey . ready ?
yeah .
okay , there it is .
it doesn &apos;t look like a tumor .
it looks like ...
wait . what is that ?
i &apos;m gonna come at it from a different angle .
there . that &apos;s better .
i just need to get a little closer .
oh , my god .
wait . is that ...
is that a-- is it ?
yes .
should we call dr. altman ?
no .
no .
merry christmas . you don &apos;t have a tumor .
you have a tree growing in your lung .
my husband has a what ?
a @-@ a tree .
you could have , uh , inhaled a seedling
and somehow , it took root and started growing in there .
we were , um , trimming our trees a couple of months ago ,
and--and stuff was flying around , but--
but--but how can it grow ?
there &apos;s--there &apos;s no light , there &apos;s no soil .
i @-@ it happens . somehow , it just adapted .
so my dad doesn &apos;t have cancer ?
no , he doesn &apos;t . uh , but he &apos;ll need a little surgery ,
and then he &apos;ll be fine .
dr.yang , can i please see you in the hall ?
my dad doesn &apos;t have cancer .
that &apos;s great .
um , to be clear , i never said he had cancer .
you were wrong . you &apos;re a bad doctor .
shh . hey . come on .
dr. yang , one minute , please .
i &apos;ll be back .
you falsified his checklist .
i streamlined it ,
and i found a tree in his lung .
you never paged dr. altman .
you just hijacked this patient .
a tree , april . a conifer .
that &apos;s ...
well , that &apos;s ...
well , did--did you ... did you tell dr. altman ?
no . i found it . he &apos;s my patient .
and i &apos;m gonna take it out myself .
you &apos;re what ?
it &apos;s a biopsy-- like a glorified lung biopsy .
otherwise known as a thorocotomy ,
which is a procedure that needs to
be supervised by an attending--
one little breach in protocol won &apos;t--
so you do admit it was a breach of protocol ?
april , if you do this with me ,
i will put in a good word for you with owen .
why would you do that ?
because it &apos;s a tree in a man &apos;s lung .
got your c.t. and blood work ,
reviewed your files .
yes , and ?
and it looks like medically , you &apos;re a candidate .
but , uh , i still have some reservations .
oh , dr.webber.
andrew perkins .
well , this is a surprise .
hope you &apos;re not here on business .
uh , actually , i have a lunch date with dr. altman .
uh , andrew , this is my-- my friend ,
uh , who i told you about .
oh , the vhl guy with , uh , diabetes ?
among other things , yes .
henry burton .
uh , sorry . i didn &apos;t mean--
no , it &apos;s fine . i am-- i &apos;m teddy &apos;s friend ,
the vhl guy with diabetes .
but hopefully , not for long .
henry &apos;s gonna be on my clinical trial .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s great . you didn &apos;t tell me that .
well , i don &apos;t like to brag , so ...
so should we get to lunch ?
yeah . yeah , sure . um , congratulations .
thanks .
i &apos;m in ? what about your reservations ?
you &apos;re going against andrew perkins .
let &apos;s just say , uh ,
i have a thing for the underdog .
he is a handsome man .
he &apos;s also one of the world &apos;s foremost trauma counselors .
if there &apos;s an earthquake , a plane crash ,
any kind of catastrophe-- he swoops in to help .
so you &apos;re saying ,
he &apos;s a professional knight in shining armor .
i &apos;m saying you need all the help you can get .
thanks .
how long of a commitment would you need ?
okay .
no , i @-@ i understand .
yeah , i @-@ i just wanted a few days .
yeah . i will .
you , too .
how &apos;s she doing ?
was that--were you just talking to the namboze clinic ?
yeah . yeah , i just wanted to get , uh , some more specifics .
so you &apos;re gonna go .
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , i &apos;d get to do incredible surgeries
right there in the trenches , plus , i &apos;d be the boss .
i mean , after bringing all these kids over here ,
i can &apos;t imagine going back to just being a resident .
being chief resident could be cool .
i mean , that would be a reason to stay ,
but i mean , who knows ?
and if i don &apos;t get it , where does that leave me ?
i &apos;m left here with nothing .
what do you think ?
stay or go ?
at this point , i really don &apos;t think it matters what i think .
hey , what are you doing ?
getting ready to remove a tree from a guy &apos;s lung .
no time for mommy prep .
okay , what if the social worker wants to ask me
about the time i spent sleeping around europe ?
oh , that &apos;s easy . you were absorbing other cultures .
okay , and what about the fact
that my mother had early @-@ onset alzheimer &apos;s
and may have passed the gene on to me ?
makes you more appreciative of the gift of life .
mm . okay , i put my hand on a bomb in a body .
she could think that was---
suicidal ?
no . it was brave .
uh , yeah , i told a shooter to shoot me .
change the subject .
chicks suck .
what &apos;s your problem ?
like you &apos;d care .
i don &apos;t , but i &apos;ve got four floors to kill ,
and i &apos;m on a hot streak .
arizona offered me this job at her old clinic in africa .
when i told lucy i was thinking about it ,
she got all pissed and stormed off .
well , did you ask her to come with you ,
tell her you &apos;d miss her ,
look deeply into her eyes ?
no .
well , obviously , she &apos;s got feelings for you .
you &apos;re dead inside . you have no feelings .
by the way , you should take that job in africa .
it &apos;d be totally amazing .
you just want me out of the running for chief resident .
just trying to help .
ugh . can i ask you a question ?
bring it .
what is it about guy &apos;s with babies
that makes women go crazy ?
doctor .
i mean , it &apos;s like when you &apos;re at the park ...
thank you .
and you see a guy with a puppy . now normally ,
you wouldn &apos;t even notice the guy ,
but then he &apos;s laughing ,
and the puppy &apos;s crawling all over him ,
and then he &apos;s--he &apos;s tickling the puppy &apos;s little puppy belly ,
and then you &apos;re thinking , i wouldn &apos;t mind spending
the rest of my life with that guy .
what is that ?
oh , everybody &apos;s looking at the baby ,
and no one &apos;s looking at mark ...
except you .
oh , kepner .
cristina .
did you get the or ?
i did . i--
yes . kepner , you know what ?
i think i figured out something about you .
i have not had sex for , like , three days ,
and i think it &apos;s giving me super powers .
everything is bright and clear .
i am solving problems .
no wonder you are so organized .
you have virgin super powers .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think that @-@ that
has anything to--
no , seriously . thank you .
i @-@ i &apos;ve been shut out of cardio for months ,
and today is , like , the first day i felt like myself .
thank you . i really needed this .
oh , my god .
what ?
you &apos;re just , like , treating me like a friend .
yeah . so ?
i &apos;ll go in and excise the tree
with minimal invasion to your lungs .
dr. yang .
join us , please .
sorry . i needed this , too .
i don &apos;t understand .
why isn &apos;t dr. yang doing the surgery ?
well , she &apos;s certainly capable ,
but dr. altman is our chief of cardio .
i have experience with complex cases like yours .
okay , see , i saw three doctors for this cough
before i came here today .
they all said the same thing , &quot; it &apos;ll go away . be patient . &quot;
and then i wake up this morning ,
and i &apos;m coughing up blood .
and then this one over here tells me it &apos;s cancer .
come on . that is not what i said .
then finally ... i meet dr. yang here .
and she says it &apos;s not a cough and it &apos;s not cancer ,
but a tree in my lung ...
and just like that , i &apos;m not gonna die .
i &apos;m gonna be fine .
so if she can do the surgery ,
i &apos;d like to stick with her .
all right . here is a scenario for you .
you are chief resident ,
and one of your colleagues comes to you
and says that he is dropping out of a clinical trial .
what do you say ?
dr. hunt ...
what do you tell him ?
i &apos;d urge him to think it through carefully ,
but i would respect his decision .
well , my opinion is that
you have a history of quitting when things get tough ,
of walking away when you &apos;re challenged .
now maybe it &apos;s because
you &apos;re not used to working hard for things
or maybe because you have a fear of success ,
but i am telling you , you &apos;re making a big mistake here .
i hear you .
i just disagree .
anything else ?
no .
thank you .
you &apos;re actually considering this ?
look , just answer the question .
can she perform the surgery ?
yes , she can .
she is capable .
in my defense ,
i was simply streamlining the process
and took the initiative ...
cut the crap . you went behind my back to spite me .
well , you gave me no choice .
okay , look , enough .
you obviously have axes to grind ,
and i &apos;m not gonna stand here while you sort it out .
in the meantime , this patient needs surgery .
he &apos;s more comfortable with yang doing it .
she should be suspended for insubordination ,
but you &apos;re gonna reward her instead ?
i &apos;ll decide disciplinary actions , dr. altman ,
and i will take them out on dr. yang , not on the patient .
you will observe .
yes , sir .
kepner , you &apos;ll assist .
oh , sir , under the circumstances ,
don &apos;t you think that it would ...
the decision &apos;s been made .
and i &apos;ll make sure dr. hunt considers this
in his evaluation for chief resident .
let &apos;s get him prepped .
if it &apos;s a sliding hernia , she could ligate her ovary .
she &apos;s freeing the hernia sac to
make sure that doesn &apos;t happen .
is she preparing to do a goldstein test ?
is she thinking about exploring the other side ?
arizona is just being thorough .
don &apos;t worry , okay ? everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
i wish you would stop saying that .
you don &apos;t know that .
saying what ?
&quot; everything &apos;s gonna be fine . &quot;
she &apos;s got a hernia , hydrocephalus , spina bifida .
anything could happen .
her bowel could rupture , her b.p. could drop out .
robbins is not gonna let that happen . she &apos;s gonna do ...
what if they find better parents for her ?
oh , come on .
what if they realize that we rushed into this
without really knowing what we &apos;re doing .
or that maybe a resident who works 80 hours a week
isn &apos;t the best candidate for a mom ?
so just please stop saying &quot; everything &apos;s gonna be okay , &quot;
because you don &apos;t know that .
okay .
everything ...
is gonna go ...
the way it goes .
thank you .
oh , please don &apos;t .
this is the only place she &apos;ll fall asleep .
turns out she &apos;s as bored with radiology as we are .
i &apos;ll get out of your way .
no , no , no . you stay .
besides , i , uh ,
i haven &apos;t really seen her up close yet .
she &apos;s so much bigger than the last time i saw her .
eats like a champ .
want to hold her ?
w--oh , no , no . no , it &apos;s okay .
come on . look at that face .
you know you want to .
no , it &apos;s o-- it &apos;s okay .
yeah , i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll just wake her ,
and then she &apos;ll cry , and then you &apos;ll hate me .
besides , she , doesn &apos;t look like she really wants to move .
uh , i should go .
i , uh ...
i am , uh , really happy for you .
you seem happy .
i am .
i have everything i always wanted .
almost .
i have it . i have it .
okay , can i get some more suction down here , please ?
look at that .
i can &apos;t believe it lived in there .
it managed to thrive in a hostile environment .
i &apos;m gonna keep it .
what ? no . no , no , it has to go to path
and then get destroyed .
it &apos;s not cancer . it &apos;s a christmas tree .
it &apos;s a pathology specimen .
protocol ...
protocol doesn &apos;t account for trees in people .
protocol accounts for whatever comes up .
that &apos;s why we have protocol ,
so there are rules and steps that we can depend on .
i know the rules seem fussy and annoying
and people hate them , and ...
the people who enforce them are fussy and annoying , too ,
but they are there for a reason ...
fine !
take it to path .
thank you . i think you &apos;ll find ...
it &apos;s not gonna be you , april .
i don &apos;t care how many boxes you check ,
you &apos;re not gonna be chief resident . 3 @-@ 0 vicryl .
here you go .
i , uh ...
gave lebo platelets ,
and the baby is , uh , stable .
a little smallish , but stable .
it &apos;s hard to believe he spent the last eight months
sleeping on a colon .
nice work .
so you gonna do it , africa ?
honestly , i &apos;m not sure .
it &apos;s a big decision to make in a day .
are you in love with lucy fields ?
lucy and i , uh , it &apos;s new .
why ?
because i don &apos;t want the person that i recommend
to pull a me and go running back
to the girl they left behind .
so just ... make sure you know what you &apos;re doing ,
or else you &apos;ll have me to answer to .
admit it--
you saw how good this baby looked on me ,
so you had to go get one of your own .
everything &apos;s a competition with you .
how &apos;d her surgery go ?
robbins said she &apos;s fine . she &apos;s feeding again .
good ,
because sofia can &apos;t wait to have a new friend .
isn &apos;t that right , sofia ?
you and zola are gonna be best friends . isn &apos;t that right ?
oh , you just wait .
this crap will be coming out of your mouth , too .
well , let &apos;s hope so .
we &apos;re dealing with the international adoption treaties ,
and the waiver we need , they just don &apos;t ...
usually give those things out .
well , you &apos;re ...
both surgeons . you &apos;d make good parents .
they &apos;re gonna see that .
we &apos;d be naive get ahead of ourselves .
you &apos;re derek shepherd .
there &apos;s a reason i &apos;ve been jealous of you my whole life ,
and it &apos;s not your hair .
you &apos;re gonna be okay . even sofia knows that .
right , sofia ? say hi ...
uncle derek .
that &apos;s zola &apos;s daddy . yes , he is , right ?
i &apos;m gonna go feed her .
so i see here that your mother was a surgeon .
what was that like ?
uh , well , being raised by a surgeon ,
you definitely ... get to be very independent .
um , and--
not that i would raise zola
the way that my mother raised me .
i , uh ...
she ... didn &apos;t bake .
she wasn &apos;t a bake sale mom ,
and i ... plan on baking all the time .
how about you tell me about zola ?
well , zola had , uh , already had a shunt
and spina bifida surgery ,
and then we realized she had this hernia .
and today in her surgery ,
it looked like she might go into s.v.t.
and just as the anesthesiologist
was about to push the adenosine ,
it &apos;s like she knew to stop ,
and her heart just slowed down all by itself ,
and she went into sinus .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s not what you asked me , right ?
i ...
you want me to talk about how cute and sweet she is ,
and she is very cute and sweet .
and i ...
she--i &apos;m not doing very well , am i ?
i don &apos;t have an agenda here , dr. grey .
i &apos;m just trying to get a sense of who you are .
i &apos;m a surgeon .
and , uh , i &apos;m a good surgeon .
and i want to be a good mother .
honestly , i don &apos;t know much about it .
but i am ready to learn ,
and i &apos;m a fast learner .
and i will do whatever it takes
to be a good mom .
you know what good moms do ?
they brag about their babies ,
and that &apos;s what i heard today .
as it turns out , zola &apos;s day didn &apos;t involve playgroup
or baby gym class .
it involved surgery ,
and you knew where she was every second .
i appreciate you sharing that with me .
i was showing initiative .
that doesn &apos;t mean you get to pretend
that you &apos;re an attending !
i wasn &apos;t pretending ,
i just didn &apos;t need an attending .
oh , my god--
teddy is doing a disservice to me
and to the education that i deserve .
i had no choice but to take my learning to my own hands .
so i took the initiative and treated a patient
and followed through to a successful outcome .
if that doesn &apos;t show the qualities
of a chief resident , i don &apos;t know what does .
you &apos;re not gonna be the chief resident .
it &apos;s not gonna be you . i &apos;m sorry .
is this from the--the chief
or--or from teddy ?
no , it &apos;s from me .
you r--you know how important this is .
chief resident can make your career .
you have your pick of fellowships .
you never had the qualifications .
based on what ?
chief resident is more than just a resume boost .
it &apos;s managing schedules ,
overseeing interns , pushing papers ,
working within the system .
that isn &apos;t you . it &apos;s never been you .
you know , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m--i &apos;m protesting this .
you are screwing with my career .
and it will kill you .
you &apos;re a surgeon ,
and anything that keeps you from being a surgeon
will hurt you and it will make you crazy .
we saw it today . you &apos;re not built for this job .
you will hate it and you will resent it
you will fight against it until you fail .
so just ... just be a surgeon .
you know , it &apos;s--it &apos;s what you are .
just be excellent at what you are .
are you done ?
yes .
thank you for your time .
i &apos;m not going to africa .
right . uh , let me just say this--
no , it &apos;s the right thing .
i @-@ i can finish my residency ,
and then maybe we can both go to africa .
alex , i just-- just listen to me .
you were right this morning .
you said there were other factors to consider ,
and you are a factor .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t say that sooner .
when robbins said they were looking for someone single ,
i mean , that &apos;s how i think of myself
because whenever i think
of a future with someone ,
i always get kicked in the teeth ,
so i stopped even looking ,
but ... now with you--
alex , stop .
okay , just stop .
you were right this morning .
career comes first . it &apos;s how it should be .
and so i ...
i took the job .
so call &apos; em . call baylor .
at namboze .
i took the job at namboze clinic .
you what ?
my job ? you took my job ?
like you said , it &apos;s not personal .
sometimes , you have to be a shark .
the job in africa ? the bitch stole it out from under me .
who ?
lucy . i told her i &apos;d stay .
you open yourself up to
someone for one freakin &apos; second ...
calahan , i &apos;ll take a double whiskey .
i freakin &apos; better get chief resident .
here you go .
scotch , please .
here you go .
you know , the rules are there for a reason .
oh , boy .
i killed a woman when i first started here .
i got fired for it ...
because i missed a little step--
one simple step .
we follow the protocols ,
we don &apos;t skip steps , people live--
simple as that .
you know , you &apos;re right .
i probably won &apos;t be chief resident ,
but the checklists work .
you can &apos;t tell me they don &apos;t .
dropping out of the chief &apos;s trial
is a real bonehead move , avery .
sir ...
such a bonehead move , that i started thinking ,
maybe the chief &apos;s trial is flawed .
so i looked into it myself .
the methodology is flawless .
in fact , it &apos;s the kind of stuff that wins awards--
big awards , like the harper avery .
you dropped out of the chief &apos;s trial
&apos;cause you knew that if your name was on it ,
it would ruin the chief &apos;s chances .
i respect that you don &apos;t want to succeed on your name ,
but don &apos;t you ever let it hold you back .
there you are .
everything okay ?
completely .
i wanted you to be the first to hear
just how okay everything is .
i got my old job back .
you &apos;re kidding .
i told &apos; em about webber &apos;s trial
and that i &apos;m getting a new pancreas .
i &apos;ve never used a pancreas
as a selling point in a job interview before ...
but it--it did the trick , which means that
i &apos;m gonna have my own insurance in a couple of months .
that &apos;s really good news .
i &apos;m glad you think so , because i &apos;ve been--
i &apos;ve been thinking about us and our situation and
where we go from here ,
and i wanted to ask you ...
teddy .
yeah . i @-@ i will be right there , andrew .
lunch and dinner-- man &apos;s getting serious .
well , dinner is to celebrate what we decided at lunch .
i &apos;m going to germany with him .
uh , well , that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s really good news , too .
it is .
right ?
yeah .
because like i said , i &apos;m gonna be fine .
which brings me back to the question
that i wanted to ask you .
what &apos;s that ?
may i please have a divorce ?
yeah . i @-@ i guess . um ...
sure .
i mean ...
you don &apos;t need me anymore , right ?
right .
i gotta go .
yeah .
yeah . okay .
adapt or die .
as many times as we &apos;ve heard it ,
the lesson doesn &apos;t get easier .
there you are .
i fed her , i changed her diaper .
prettiest poop you ever saw .
oh , really ?
hi , baby girl .
oh , i missed you .
yes , mommy got to be a surgeon again today .
i got to fix two dislocated shoulders
and save a leg from amputation ...
and a fractured ... yes .
problem is ...
we &apos;re human .
we want more than just to survive .
you staring at sloan again ?
oh . the--the baby . did you see her ?
how--how did the interview go ?
i &apos;m out .
what ? what happened ?
it &apos;s a long story . it &apos;s fine .
seriously . i &apos;m okay with it .
i have you .
what else do i need ?
we want love .
hi , zola .
i &apos;m meredith .
i &apos;m hoping to be your mama .
we want success .
you know it &apos;s gonna be mer , right ?
it doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re a bad surgeon
or a bad doctor .
some people just ... don &apos;t fit the bill .
they &apos;re better at other things ...
like you and those kids . i mean , you &apos;re good at that .
but between you and mer-- she &apos;s organized ,
people like her , people trust her .
she &apos;s a natural .
people trust her .
i &apos;m just saying , go steal your job back .
i mean , go to africa . that what you &apos;re good at .
go do what you &apos;re good at .
we want to be the best that we can be .
okay , i know you &apos;re mad ,
but you can &apos;t just sit here and drink all night ,
so i &apos;m gonna take you home and ...
i--okay , i was not expecting that .
you told me to be excellent ,
so i &apos;m gonna be .
i &apos;m gonna be an excellent surgeon
and i &apos;m gonna be excellent in bed tonight .
so we fight like hell to get those things .
you all right , karev ?
meredith messed with the alzheimer &apos;s trial .
anything else feels ...
