There's a safe. Here's the location and the key code.
No!
Drop it!
If Malcolm finds out that you killed his daughter --
That was me.
Doesn't matter. He'll bury us all.
We're gonna have to make sure he doesn't find out.
Daniel attacked you. You shot him.
Only when I knew he intended to kill me.
She had to shoot him? Self-defense?
What happened has been hard for all of us to accept.
But I don't accept it.
If all this hadn't happened,
we'd be having her funeral right now.
You were gonna kill Victoria?
My brother values our secrets.
He'll do anything to keep 'em buried.
I found the envelope
you were looking for.
Would you destroy it, please?
I'm trying to track down Agent Kate Taylor.
Was she working with anyone on your team?
Jack Porter. What'd you say your name was?
Malcolm Black.
He gonna make it?
What happens if he doesn't?
Then I'll have two bodies to deal with.
Boss wants him alive.
This guy's the mastermind behind Flight 197.
Moved all that money around for the terrorists
like David friggin' Copperfield.
No, I didn't.
I didn't.
Boss heard Conrad Grayson was gonna kill him,
so he figured,
one man's trash...
Who...
Who do you work for?
Same as you now.
You didn't come to bed last night.
They I.D.ed the body. It's him.
So it's taken care of then.
I know that I owe everything to your sacrifice,
the lie that we told in Daniel's name.
The irony is I still lost you.
That's why you slept on the couch, right?
It's that...
I find it hard to lie next to you after what you confessed.
If you hadn't betrayed me...
The choices I made 20 years ago...
You know I was desperate to save my son.
Now he's gone anyway. So...
I can't expect your forgiveness.
How can I when I can't forgive myself?
They're bringing over the rest of Daniel's things.
I would appreciate a couple of hours to go through them.
Of course.
Then how about we, uh, talk tonight,
away from here?
The lighthouse in Montauk.
Our old rendezvous.
Of course.
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
You're welcome.
Well, look what the tide brought in.
More like the commuter flight from D.C.
And you must be Nolan Ross.
Lyman Ellis.
It is an honor
to have a future congressman grace my club.
One of my most staunch supporters summers up here,
so I couldn't leave town without seeing my baby sis.
I assume you came to scold me.
Now why would you think a thought like that?
Fox and CNN picked up that muckraking piece on daddy's death,
and you show up not a week later?
Yeah, well, I was surprised
you were the one dredging up that whole ordeal.
Made me worry something was wrong,
and maybe it's time we got you back home to Savannah.
Well, you know, actually, that...
article was my fault.
I gossiped to the wrong person.
And while I can't unring that bell,
how about you join us for dinner tonight?
You can fill me in on your run for office
and maybe accept a handsome campaign donation.
Well, that's, uh...
I'm, uh...
I apologize for charging in on you like this, Lou.
You know how overprotective I can be.
But I'd be a fool not to accept
your friend's apology and contribution.
Every penny counts.
That it does.
Thank you for coming.
I would've come down, but...
Victoria's still there?
Yes, she is. What's wrong?
Exactly that.
After what you told me, how...
I interrupted your plan for her...
I'm meeting her tonight, at the lighthouse in Montauk.
They'll rule it a suicide.
Grieving mother jumps to her death.
I'm not inhuman.
Seeing her mourn Daniel gave me pause,
but that doesn't erase what she's done.
Killing her would?
Death for Victoria would be merciful.
She has nothing left.
Now is the time to let her suffer.
Please. I sacrificed my whole life for this moment.
Don't rob me of it.
Let's just walk away from all of this.
I don't care where we go. I just...
want a chance to get to know you.
I'd like that.
Then let's go.
I just need a week or so to tie up some loose ends.
Stay with me until then?
Do you remember how happy we were
when we first moved here?
Thought it was heaven.
The devil can have it.
All right, buddy. Have a good day.
Say, "Bye-bye, daddy!"
Bye, daddy.
Bye.
How you doin' there?
Jack Porter. Right?
That's right.
Douglas Taylor.
Agent Kate Taylor is my daughter.
How can I help you?
Chief Alvarez tells me
you two are working on something together.
I was hoping you could shed some light on a few things.
Sure.
Bureau said that, uh...
she took a vacation just after she closed your case.
We wrapped up a few days back.
Have you seen her since?
No.
Why?
You think she took a vacation around here?
Well...
It sure as hell wasn't Miami.
You're a father.
Hate to tell you,
the worry never ends.
You protect him...
while you can.
We have a problem.
Where's Lyman?
On my yacht, getting into his tennis whites.
He'll be back shortly.
Says he wants to hear all about my life in the Hamptons.
So when he asked you about going home,
that's really code for another stint in a mental facility, right?
I really need him to see how well I'm doing here
so I can stay.
We'll convince him at dinner tonight.
But whatever happens, you can't leave.
We're only halfway through our summer of debauchery.
Amen.
Nolan.
Morning, Ems.
Um, Louise, this is Emily Thorne,
my other partner in crime.
So nice to finally meet you.
You, too.
You know, I was real sorry to hear about...
what happened with Daniel.
He was one of my first friends here in the Hamptons.
Yeah. Mine, too.
Well, I better run and reserve a court.
Bye for now.
Bye.
You okay?
Better. I spoke to my dad.
I talked him out of it.
What is the world coming to?
You spared Victoria's life? Again?
As many times as I've considered it,
you know that death was never my intention. And...
too much blood has been shed,
Daniel's included.
So...
for my father's sake and mine,
We're gonna leave the Hamptons.
Ems, you're finally gonna get your happy ending.
I'm really gonna miss you.
Oh, please. You're already hobnobbing with hot redheads.
Gentlemen prefer blondes.
You know that.
I'm just trying to help Louise deal with her brother.
Wait. Lyman Ellis is in town?
Oh, yeah.
He came to slap her hand for that Lemarchal article.
But you know politicians.
All's forgiven with the right donation.
But you don't think that's all he wants.
I don't trust the guy.
He has a strange effect on Louise, almost like...
she's scared of him.
God, I would love a second opinion.
Would you join us for dinner tonight?
If you need me, I'm there.
Depending on how things unfold,
this could become your farewell takedown.
David?
I think I was wrong.
About what? Tonight?
Yeah. My mind is still all over the place,
and you need time with Daniel's memories.
And you wanna be with your daughter.
Yeah. I do.
I understand.
If this is going to happen,
it's not something we can force.
I know. Thank you.
I'll call you later.
How the hell is this happening?
I thought they I.D.ed his body in Miami.
He must've realized it was a trap.
And what, he faked his own death?
What did he say? What does he know?
He knows where I live and that I have a son,
who's now staying with my cousins
till we can figure out how the hell to take care of this.
No. You need to proceed as normal.
Just go to work. Don't arouse suspicion.
Don't call me. They'll be tracing my number.
I'll contact you.
And, Jack,
don't go near Amanda.
As far as Malcolm knows, she's dead.
We need to keep it that way until this is over.
All right.
I'm glad you called. How you holding up?
Okay, considering.
I'm sorry that, um,
that I got emotional in the interrogation.
That's not really like me.
Yeah, I'm sorry if I pushed you.
I was just doing my job.
So is the investigation over?
Yeah. Chief closed it yesterday.
As he should have.
In general, Alvarez has a tendency
to move quickly on those things.
I do a meeting with him today to talk about a promotion.
For detective?
That's great. And -- and long overdue, I'm sure.
Yeah. Kinda like that date you still owe me.
You know...
to be honest, I would like that.
But, um,
I might be heading out of town soon.
All right. So when you're back then.
I told you, Lyman, I'm fine.
I found these on your yacht.
Label says it was filled last month,
but this bottle is more than half-full.
Because they don't help.
Louise, Dr. Silverman says if you're not medicated,
you're not only endangering yourself,
you're endangering everyone around you.
What would your friend Nolan say
if he knew about your obsessive tendencies?
And how we fought to keep you out of jail?
Stop that. I wouldn't hurt Nolan.
You never mean to hurt anyone, Louise.
You're just not stable enough to be living on your own.
Now at supper tonight,
I wanted to tell your friends how you decided to come home.
Okay, now if you don't do it, I will,
and I will make sure they know exactly why.
Thank you for coming by.
I can only hope you've asked me here
to finally tell me what happened to Daniel.
Actually, I wanted to show you this.
Things he kept from when he was a child.
I started to go through them today,
but I...
Every morning,
I wake up, and for a brief moment...
barely a second...
I'm happy.
As if sleep has allowed me to forget.
But then it hits me.
And that moment,
when I remember...
it's the worst part of my day.
I want him here.
Me, too.
But we'll get through this together, Margaux.
Will we?
Of course. We're family.
I thought we were.
But then why would you put me through such hell?
What am I supposed to say to my child?
To your grandchild?
That their father died assaulting an innocent woman?
Daniel's death
is not how we will remember his life.
This is.
And you will pass these things along to your baby.
The only thing I want to give my child
is the truth.
Nolan?
Oh, I'm trying to decide what to wear tonight...
Something that says southern comfort
without too much twang.
I just left the club.
I overheard Louise and her brother arguing.
Yeah. She called me and told me all about it.
Seems Lyman went a little sybil on her after I left.
But I told her that i would talk him down tonight.
What?
Did you know that Louise was institutionalized?
Claremont?
A place that you know full well
has a history of confining sane people against their will.
I actually think it's in their brochure.
Lyman also talked about
obsessive tendencies, violent outbursts.
Nolan...
Okay, what?
There was a little snafu in the steam room.
She locked Margaux inside... allegedly.
What?!
Allegedly.
Is that what he was referring to
when he said they were fighting to keep her out of jail?
No, he was probably referring to whatever's inside
her criminal file that I hacked.
You have her criminal file?
Yes, but, Ems...Ems,
I am trying to protect her privacy.
I'm protecting you.
According to this, she was charged with assault and battery.
Her ex-roommate ended up in a coma.
Clearly, her family wanted this sealed so people wouldn't know
how dangerous she is.
Okay, I get it.
You think I'm making another self-destructive choice.
No, it's more that I'm wondering why you're turning such a blind eye.
Because I believe she's a good person
who's had a hard life.
Does that sound familiar?
Okay, Louise... mm, may be crazy,
but that doesn't mean
my instincts about her or her brother are wrong.
I've gone along on your hunches time and again.
Come on, Ems.
Will you go with me on this one?
Yo, you didn't see Alvarez when you came in this morning, did you?
Supposed to have a meeting with him,
talk about a promotion.
He blew me off.
You don't think he's messing with me, do you?
Are you even listening to me?
I am. I'm just -- I'm trying to check in on Carl.
I thought you were taking a couple personal days.
It's Margaux Lemarchal.
It's the third time she's called me today.
She will not let this Daniel Grayson thing rest.
What do you mean?
She's hell-bent on proving
that Emily did not kill him in self-defense.
But not only is the case closed,
there's no way that Emily is a killer.
Dispatch trying to get a 10-20 on Alvarez.
Get in line.
Patrol available to check his house?
Copy that.
You always were a tentative little pissant,
weren't you, David?
See, my daughter knows to talk first.
So this better be a courtesy call
telling me that you found her phone.
If you wanna see her again, you'll do exactly as I say.
You have had two years to plot your revenge on me.
Is this really how you wanna play it?
As your ill-conceived trap in Miami proved,
you're way out of your league, boy.
Although I did lose one of my men.
By my count, you're down four,
And I don't think you wanna make it five.
If you dare harm my daughter...
Kate's fine.
For now.
Let me talk to her.
Let me see.
How did you respond when I asked you exactly the same question?
David.
I know you're worried about your darling Amanda,
but I have some good news.
She found some gainful employment.
Where did you get these?
I took them.
Stayed for the whole show.
And why wouldn't it?
You'd have been so proud, David.
The things that she does...
Stay away from her, you son of a bitch!
I'm finished. I want out.
Yeah? Where you gonna go?
You're a wanted man.
And I saved your life.
Those pictures are just a reminder
that every second that you work for me,
you're saving hers.
Trust me when I say, David,
She's worth it.
Because of you,
I never had a chance to say good-bye to my daughter.
Maybe I should return the favor.
And what about the ones that you cared for?
Like Victoria?
Or your beloved little grandson?
I think it's worth Kate's life.
I'm listening.
I'll send you her location tonight.
When you have it you will leave the country immediately
and I'll never hear from you again.
If not, the authorities get that flash drive,
it will be over for both of you.
Do we have a deal?
Do I have a choice?
Good evening, gentlemen.
Miss Thorne, what a nice surprise.
I do hope Mr. Ross has not twisted your arm
to attend on my account.
My mama taught me better.
I hate to be rude, but...
Not at all.
I can't imagine how busy you must be
just weeks away from being elected to congress.
From your lips. Excuse me.
Frankly, my dear,
I am so glad you give a damn,
because after 20 minutes of schmoozing,
I still can't tell if he deserves
a "brother of the year" award
or the red sharpie.
Is your revenge-y sense tingling?
It's too early to tell.
Where's Louise?
She went to go freshen up ages ago.
Ems, she's so nervous.
I'll go check on her.
Louise Virginia Ellis,
pull yourself together.
What would mama say if she saw you like this?
Need some help?
No.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.
I didn't know anyone else was in here.
You must've heard me talking to myself.
I am positively mortified.
Don't be.
Xanax.
Calms my nerves.
Hey, half the Hamptons are on it.
How long you been taking those?
Years.
After I lost my daddy, I-I had a hard time copin'.
These made the pain disappear.
If they could only make my family disappear...
Must be intimidating,
having a brother in the political spotlight.
It's not that.
He inherited my father's southern charm,
so everybody loves Lyman.
But you don't?
No, of course I do. He's my brother.
It's just, everyone has two faces,
some more disturbing than others.
I mean, you of all people would know,
after what happened with Danny.
Yeah.
Well, just goes to show
just can't judge the honey by looking at the bee.
And I hope you don't judge me
based on this little interaction.
Oh, of course not.
Any friend of Nolan's...
Alvarez never showed today.
According to Malcolm, that's who sent him to me.
You don't think he...
I wouldn't put anything past Malcolm.
That's why this has to end.
I'm meeting him here tonight.
What's your plan?
I told him that I have his daughter.
What? You mean alive?
What happens when he finds out she's not?
He won't.
I told him that I'd text him the location where Kate is.
When he arrives, he'll find me instead.
Then I'll end this.
I want you to know in case anything happens to me,
so you can tell Amanda.
Look, David...
if he knew Miami was a trap,
he's gonna smell this a mile away.
Well, if he does, there's a flash drive...
evidence that I've accumulated of all his criminal activity.
Nolan knows where to find it.
If things go south, just tell him to release it.
Why not do that in the first place?
Turn it over to the feds.
I appreciate that after everything,
you still believe in the justice system, Jack,
but everyone bends the rules when it pays.
Or when it suits them.
Even you.
Catch you later, sir.
See ya.
This is Emily. Leave a message.
Hey, it's Ben.
I know you said you're leaving town soon,
but, I'm just getting off of work.
I thought, I'm free tonight. Maybe you are, too.
I know it's getting late, but...
anyway...
Emily, give me a call. Bye.
Now I get it.
I'm sorry?
I could not figure out why you've been ignoring my calls,
but now it makes sense.
You don't have time to investigate the suspect
because you're too busy wooing her.
As I told you, the case is closed.
And you know for a fact it was self-defense?
I questioned Emily myself.
Yeah, I'm sure you did.
But I imagine her testimony would be ruled invalid
if anyone knew you two were dating.
We are not dating.
Whatever it is,
have your superiors realized you have no objectivity?
Look, you can complain to whomever you want.
They're all gonna tell you the same thing.
That this precinct is corrupt.
I will find out what happened to Daniel,
even if it means throwing every bit of media at this
until the truth is uncovered.
Because it seems everyone else in this town
has gone completely mad,
accepting Emily Thorne's word as gospel.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm...
Margaux!
Margaux?
Get an ambulance here now!
Dispatch...
Margaux.
With our national health care in a constant state of flux,
not enough attention's being paid to the mental health arena.
Did you know an estimated 1 in 5 adults
suffers from some form of mental illness?
Good God. They don't wanna hear this.
Can't you give it a rest for just one night?
Lyman, I think Louise is right.
You have earned a night off. Well...
at least now you have.
Oh, with such generous friends,
it's no wonder you don't want to leave.
I appreciate your contribution.
Although I have to admit,
it's hard for me to hold my tongue.
This subject is so near to my heart,
considering my sister's own battle.
That's enough.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, Louise.
Our father, God rest his soul, was an alcoholic.
More like a commode-hugging, knee-walking drunk.
And poor Louise was barely 13 years old
when she found him dead at the bottom of our master staircase.
Daddy's little girl.
Ever since then, Lou's suffered from depression
and panic attacks and delusions.
It's all completely manageable,
but only under constant supervision,
which I fear she's not been getting.
I'm sorry to hear that.
She needs to be locked up for the rest of her pathetic life.
You need to stop your clucking.
Pardon me?
You're trying to embarrass me
in front of my friends here on purpose.
Friends?
These people are not your friends.
I'm just trying to convey the seriousness of the situation.
Louise, what do you keep looking at?
Louise.
It's okay.
You can see it in their eyes, can't you?
They're starting to understand
what I have known since you were born,
that you're a waste of life.
You shut up!
You shut your mouth, mother! Shut up!
Okay, she's having one of her delusions.
I need to get her home.
Louise.
I am not a waste. I am not a waste.
Daddy loved me and he understood me.
But you, you are the devil!
And so is Lyman!
No.
You are the only hell I ever raised!
Louise!
Nolan. I'm so, so sorry.
It's all right. You're fine. You're fine.
You understand now why I need to get her home.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
Guess you were right.
Actually...
I think you were.
You sure I can't get you anything?
I told you, you don't need to stay.
I don't know why the doctor is taking so long.
First time in an America E.R.?
Well, legend has it this cafeteria has
the best worst coffee in town.
Can't pass that up.
Anything for you?
No.
Ben?
Thank you.
I'm glad to see you're relaxing...
something you need to do more of.
The baby is healthy,
your panels are normal,
but your blood pressure
is a little bit higher than I'd like.
You need to de-stress.
Easier said than done.
Prenatal yoga,
more sleep,
lean on your family.
You have anyone in town?
She does.
Why don't you stay the night and get some rest?
And I'll contact your O.B.
I heard about your collapse.
The doctor just said I should avoid stress.
That would include you.
She also said that you need people to lean on.
And whether you accept me as family or not,
I am here for you.
I see now that I made a mistake.
Keeping the truth from you has driven you mad,
and that's not fair.
But I need you to promise me
that what I'm about to tell you stays in the family.
I promise.
Daniel didn't die trying to kill Emily.
He saved her.
And what I told you about her wasn't untrue.
She did ruin Daniel in a profound way,
but what I didn't tell you is why she did it.
And if I'm to come clean,
and we're to have no secrets between us...
I have to start at the beginning
with a damaged little girl named Amanda Clarke,
also known as Emily Thorne.
And that was only the first of her deeply twisted lies.
Very kind of you to check on me, but completely unnecessary.
My brother's right. I need to be home under a doctor's care.
No, I think that's the last place you should be.
Louise, those pills you're taking,
your family doctor sends them to you?
Long as I can remember.
Well, you said it was Xanax.
And earlier when I saw one,
I found it strange that it was in a capsule form. So...
I decided to take it to a pharmacist friend in the city.
Turns out that, yes, it's Xanax...
but it's compounded with Larium.
What's Larium?
An antimalarial drug.
After all of my years abroad,
I've seen more than one person suffer from the side effects,
which looked a lot like what we saw tonight...
Paranoid delusions that lead to aggression.
Wait.
Are you saying...
Your family's been drugging you.
I think the question is, why?
What do they have to gain by you seeming crazy?
As long as I'm incapacitated,
mother controls the inheritance that daddy left me.
See, she already burned through hers financing Lyman's campaign.
And to think Lyman chose mental health funding
as his platform.
No, but we don't know he's involved.
Louise...
Even the simplest implication would derail his career.
This could've killed you, louise.
But it didn't.
Look, I'd really like to keep this between us.
My family's skeletons belong in the closet.
But I am so grateful to you.
You saved my life and my sanity.
Like they say, sanity's relative...
unless, of course, your relatives are insane.
Well, I'm at least gonna make sure
this Dr. Silverman is shut down.
What is this?
I'm so sorry. After everything you've done for me...
Where did you get this?
Nolan's house.
Victoria asked me to find it for her.
And in the state I was in, I just wasn't thinkin' clearly.
Yeah, but... but I've never seen this before.
It was in the kitchen in that folder.
Kate's folio.
Look, I don't even know what it means.
I do.
Stand down.
What the hell are you doing here?
I can't let you do this, David.
Say that your plan works.
Best case scenario, you take out Malcolm,
but you don't know how many people he has with him
or who might come looking for him once he's gone.
You... you can leave town.
I can't.
I already thought this through.
This isn't you.
You don't know me, not anymore.
Not after what Malcolm made me do.
I just couldn't hold on to who I was.
I was losing my mind.
I remember one point, I tried to reach out to Amanda, and...
I wrote her a letter.
This guard said that he'd deliver it for me...
and then Malcolm found out.
He said that
I could choose...
This man's life
or your daughter's.
But choosing wasn't enough.
He made me do it myself.
He said if I killed all those people on Flight 197, then
I shouldn't have a hard time killing a dying man.
Malcolm was beginning to suspect that
I wasn't the criminal that he thought I was.
And if I confirmed it,
he would've killed me.
No, please.
No, don't. Don't.
I was forced to become the man that he needed me to be.
Conrad ruined my life,
but Malcolm, he damned my soul to hell.
I'm not gonna be free until he's dead.
It's too late, David.
I met with Nolan a couple hours ago.
He gave me the code to the safe.
I-I turned in the flash drive, anonymously.
They're waiting for Malcolm outside.
Police! Drop your weapons!
Get on the ground.
Get on your knees!
Come on! You kidding me?
Get on your knees!
Now! Do it!
I'm sorry, but if that man is the monster you say he is,
I'm glad I did what I did.
There was enough evidence on there
to put him away for the rest of his life.
And now you can have the rest of yours.
If you only knew how wrong you are.
Thanks for coming over so late, Lyman.
Oh, no, thank you.
I wanted to apologize for my sister's behavior.
In some ways, it's fortunate
you witnessed it in a safe environment,
but it always breaks my heart to see her like that.
Does it...
Just...
break your heart?
Louise didn't want me to say anything.
Yeah, clearly, you've done quite a number on that girl, but...
well, couldn't let you slink out of town thinking you'd won.
How could you do it?
Poisoning your own sister for God knows how long.
I don't know what lies she's been feeding you, but I...
No, no, no, I'm talking about the pills
that you've been feeding her.
The ones you had compounded with Larium?
What are you talking about?
Lyman, the panic attacks, the hallucinations...
you caused all of it.
Now wait a minute. If what you're saying is true,
I need to speak to our family doctor.
I-I need to get to the bottom of this.
And while you work on all that back home on the plantation,
Louise is gonna stay right here.
You wanna challenge me on that? Be my guest.
But, you wouldn't be the first politician
whose career I've ruined.
I appreciate your intention here,
protecting my sister, I do,
but I promise you I had nothing to do with this.
Yeah, give it up, Lyman.
You already lost my vote and my check.
Porter, you're not on third shift, are you?
No, sir, sarge.
I heard a S.W.A.T. team arrested a guy
named Malcolm Black earlier.
Yeah, sure did. They turned him over to the Feds.
But then I heard he was released.
The agent assigned said there was a lack of evidence.
Somebody's head's gonna roll.
David?
You sent that text.
Yeah, well, when your best friend is a hacker,
you pick up a few tricks along the way.
What do you want?
I've been asking myself the same question.
I showed you mercy.
I actually had compassion for you
when you lost your son.
And when you blamed his death on me,
I accepted it.
As you should have.
You seduced and used Daniel as if he was nothing,
you should've come after Conrad or me --
He wasn't nothing to me.
And I saw the photo that you had Louise steal.
Kate was there because of you.
Daniel died because of you.
How dare you!
I begged your father to go to the F.B.I., and he refused.
The only way to appease Malcolm was to get Kate the money...
money that you had to save your father!
I had no idea it would escalate.
And I never told her that
you were Amanda Clarke.
Oh, save your breath.
You're gonna need it to run.
From you?
From my father.
Because once I tell him what you've done,
I'm not gonna be able to stop him.
Then don't,
because I would rather die than be saved by...
Amanda Clarke's alive.
I came for your father.
Look what I found.
This is so much better.
Night-night.
