you had an alibi witness
and your public defender let her get away ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been saying .
i told you when i started this thing
i &apos;m not going to collude .
we &apos;re not colluding . it &apos;s called discovery .
so , why don &apos;t you tell me what kevin miller knows ?
he developed the trading programs
that sutter claims to use to get his superior returns .
so you &apos;re looking to have kevin testify
that software is bullshit , and sutter knows it .
the thing that i worked so hard on
to get that prick &apos;s approval was nothing but a lie .
you told jill and--
she already knew .
she was in on it .
what the hell is in the bag , harvey ?
what you needed to keep this case going
and i stopped you from getting .
so let &apos;s just admit that we &apos;re in this together
and get this thing done .
i want your word right now
that you won &apos;t tell anyone what i told you .
kevin , please , you--
mike , i &apos;m serious .
no one can ever know
anything about what i told you .
the judge decided to rule
on your motion to dismiss after all .
which means we &apos;re out of time .
i came here to ask for that trading program .
leonard bailey &apos;s execution date has been set .
and i don &apos;t know how to tell a man that he &apos;s going to die .
who are you ?
mr. bailey , my name is jessica pearson .
and i &apos;m lead counsel on your case .
well , you coming here ,
it must be about something important .
it is .
leonard ,
your execution date has been set .
when ?
just because they &apos;ve set the date doesn &apos;t--
when ?
30 days .
leonard , i &apos;m so sorry .
i don &apos;t need your sorry .
i want to know what you &apos;re doing about this .
we &apos;re going to file a motion to delay .
i don &apos;t give a shit about delaying .
i mean ,
what are we doing to get me out ?
we &apos;re--we &apos;re working on it .
but i @-@ i do think , leonard , that it &apos;s really important
that you take some time to process this .
i &apos;ve been processing for 12 years !
you said that you were going to find maria .
so tell me , what are you doing here
instead of out there tracking her down ?
leonard , i know that this is difficult , and--
mr. bailey , what rachel means
is that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re going to do .
mr. cahill , you better have a compelling reason
why i shouldn &apos;t grant mr. specter a dismissal ,
or this thing is going to be over before it gets started .
oh , i have the most compelling reason of all .
a copy of mr. sutter &apos;s trading program .
bullshit . he was in here trying to subpoena
this thing last week
and now it miraculously falls in his lap ?
what are you implying ?
i &apos;m implying
i don &apos;t know what you did , but santa sure as hell
didn &apos;t put that thing under your tree last night .
well , unless you have proof that i did something wrong ,
you can shut the hell up .
all right , that &apos;s enough .
now assuming this thing is legitimate ,
what &apos;s it gonna show me ?
it &apos;s going to show you that it &apos;s responsible for 95 %
of mr. sutter &apos;s trades over five years .
are you trying to win this case for me
because my entire defense
is that my client makes his trades using that program .
exactly .
it &apos;s not the 95 %
i &apos;m concerned with , it &apos;s the other five .
those are the ones he made billions of dollars on .
the only way he could have done that
is by trading on inside information .
motion for dismissal denied .
gentlemen , we &apos;re going to trial .
but mr. cahill , if it comes to light
that you obtained this program illegally ,
not only am i going toss this case ,
you &apos;re gonna be faced with a charge of malicious prosecution .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
i don &apos;t give a shit what we &apos;re gonna do .
i want to know where the hell he got that thing .
i don &apos;t know ,
but that &apos;s not the only question we need to answer .
what other question is there ?
william , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed ,
but you &apos;ve got an employee that &apos;s looking to take you down
and we need to figure out who it is .
how exactly are we going to do that ?
we &apos;re gonna start conducting interviews
with every employee you have .
but before we do that ,
i &apos;m gonna make sure sean cahill
isn &apos;t hiding anything else from us in discovery .
so , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i need to handle this myself .
what are you coming to me here for , harvey ,
sutter &apos;s 30 feet away .
relax . he thinks i &apos;m making sure
that you didn &apos;t pull another fast one with discovery .
so as long as it looks like we &apos;re arguing ,
we &apos;re fine .
that &apos;s not gonna be a problem &apos; cause i got some news .
what are you talking about ?
two seconds after you left , she put us on the docket .
we go to trial in five days ,
and right now i don &apos;t have shit .
what do you want me to say , sean ?
i &apos;m already using what we did
to shake the trees with his employees .
that &apos;s not good enough .
so you need to go back to that prison
and tell mike that he better get me something and get it fast
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t sell my soul last night
to watch that bastard ride off into the sunset .
第六季 第七集
thank god you are both here .
french cruller for goddess number one .
cinnamon sugar for goddess number two .
while i do appreciated a tasty doughnut ,
i &apos;d like to know what the occasion is .
there are exactly three reasons for louis
to come bearing pastry .
esther got a bad haircut ,
he found someone to fix his crooked thumb ,
or he wants our advice .
i wish like hell it was the thumb ,
but it &apos;s actually advice .
last night , i had the most amazing time with tara .
i know you &apos;re both picturing it involved fantastic sex .
nope .
not a bit .
in any event , tara and i have a date on friday night ,
and i &apos;m hoping it ends with our souls merging as one .
and i &apos;m out .
what ? why ?
because i am a professional secretary , louis .
i &apos;m not here to help you play hide the litt
with some strumpet .
she so doesn &apos;t get me .
you know what , louis ? she has a point .
what are you talking about ?
a lot of manpower has been devoted
to your pursuit of this virtual stranger .
and by manpower , i mean my precious time .
so i think it &apos;s time that you took care of this yourself .
goddamn it .
don &apos;t you think if i could have i would have ?
what i think is , if you can &apos;t figure out
how to have a simple date
with a woman who &apos;s already agreed to go out with you ,
then maybe you don &apos;t deserve to go out with her
in the first place .
how &apos;s that for advice ?
harvey .
what are you doing here ?
what do you mean what am i doing here ?
i need to know if you have anything yet .
i don &apos;t .
are you kidding me ?
after the way those two guys got into it ,
you &apos;re telling me kevin didn &apos;t start talking
the second he left the room ?
no . he didn &apos;t say a word .
well , we need to get him to say something
to get you out of here .
yeah , i know . but i can &apos;t just push a button
and get kevin to turn on sutter .
yes , you can .
what are you talking about ?
you can tell him his algorithm was leaked to cahill .
when the hell did that happen ?
last night , when i leaked it .
jesus christ , so you &apos;re just out and out colluding now .
look , i didn &apos;t have a choice .
the judge was gonna toss this case
unless cahill came up with a hail mary .
all right , i--i &apos;ll use it the best i can with kevin .
but , harvey , he &apos;s sensitive .
this is gonna take a little time .
that &apos;s the thing , mike . we don &apos;t have time .
the judge set a trial date .
which means if you don &apos;t get cahill something soon ,
you &apos;re gonna be sitting here for the next two years .
what &apos;s going on , rachel ?
you haven &apos;t said a word the entire ride back .
nothing .
just a lot harder than i thought it would be .
you didn &apos;t think he would be angry .
i didn &apos;t think that he &apos;d be angry at us .
well , he wasn &apos;t angry at us .
there just wasn &apos;t anybody else in that room .
so now what ?
now we try to fix this damn thing .
you mean by finding maria gomez .
i mean by delaying this execution .
jessica , leonard &apos;s right .
what good does it do to delay the execution
if we can &apos;t stop it from happening ?
because if we don &apos;t , we don &apos;t have time
to find maria gomez .
i was thinking about what you told me last night
about getting jill immunity .
mike , i told you , i don &apos;t want to talk about this .
maybe you want to talk about what &apos;s going to happen to her
if sutter goes down anyway .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
you don &apos;t know that .
yeah , well , i know what happens
if either one of us turns on him .
we won &apos;t have a penny to our name .
are you kidding me ? is he paying you to be in here ?
listen to me , everything we have is tied to that man .
and if he goes away , we lose it all .
that &apos;s not what i asked . did he promise you money
if you kept quiet ?
of course he goddamn did .
and the day i get out of here , jill and i are going to
take that money and start a new life .
or you could both cut a deal and start a new life right now .
what kind of life is that gonna be ?
because i come from nothing .
and i &apos;m not gonna do that to my kids .
well , i &apos;m telling you there are worse things you could be .
why are you so interested in my well being ?
because i &apos;m your friend and i was in your position .
and i decided it was better to give it all up
than to keep looking over my shoulder
waiting for the ax to fall .
what are you talking about ?
you know i was a fraud , right ? you know i did it for years .
what you don &apos;t know is that i quit
20 minutes before i got arrested .
and it was 20 of the most peaceful minutes of my entire life .
yeah , well , look at what happened to you anyways .
kevin , that &apos;s not the--
that &apos;s enough .
i told you i &apos;m done talking about it , and i &apos;m done .
and if you &apos;re really my friend ,
you won &apos;t ever bring this up to me again .
get backstage seats to &quot; hamilton . &quot;
mm , rent out central park .
fly the concorde to paris .
no , wait , that &apos;s stupid
because they don &apos;t have the concorde anymore .
holy shit , that &apos;s it .
find the last existing concorde ,
rent it , and fly that to paris .
louis , whatever you &apos;re doing , i need you to put it down .
not now , harvey . i &apos;m planning the ultimate date
for the love of my life .
this is for mike .
all right , what do you need me to do ?
this is every big money trade
william sutter &apos;s made in the last five years .
i need you to go through it , reverse engineer it ,
and find any evidence you can of insider trading .
that would be a lot easier if i had access to sutter &apos;s files .
well , i can &apos;t get that to you right now .
why not ?
because he can &apos;t know we &apos;re doing this .
okay , harvey , last week you told me
that you were protecting me
by not telling me what &apos;s going on .
stop protecting me ,
and what the hell is going on ?
i cut a deal with sean cahill .
sutter goes down , mike gets out .
holy shit .
i know .
and don &apos;t tell me mike still doesn &apos;t have anything for you .
no , he doesn &apos;t . and his trial starts in five days .
well , i better get on it .
thank you , louis .
hey , mike . how &apos;s it going ?
what are you doing here , gallo ?
you know , when i was on the outside ,
i wasn &apos;t the biggest , i wasn &apos;t the strongest ,
i wasn &apos;t even the smartest .
but they let me run things . you know why ?
no . i have a feeling you &apos;re about to tell me .
i had a knack for knowing when something didn &apos;t smell right .
something doesn &apos;t smell right with you .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you &apos;re gonna tell me
harvey didn &apos;t stop by this morning to see you .
tracking my every move now ?
i sure as hell am .
you think i &apos;m gonna trust the two of you with my freedom ?
harvey said that he &apos;ll get you out and he will .
and what if he already tried and he can &apos;t ?
that didn &apos;t happen .
yeah , well let me run a little scenario by you .
he filed whatever you filed and it didn &apos;t fly .
then he came to tell you that ,
so the two of you would have your stories straight
so you could string me along .
that &apos;s not what happened , gallo .
he came here to see me about my case .
you want to know something , mike ?
i don &apos;t give a shit about your case .
so you tell harvey next time he comes here ,
he better come with some progress .
&apos;cause i &apos;ve got that sense of smell .
and something in here stinks .
donna paulsen &apos;s office , how can i help you ?
you have a call from danbury ...
i &apos;ll accept the charges .
please hold while your call is being connected .
donna .
my birthday &apos;s not for another week ,
but i appreciate the call .
your birthday &apos;s not for another five months and six days
and you know i know that .
and i also know that you &apos;ll be here
helping me celebrate with everyone .
thanks , donna .
you doing okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m hanging in .
good . now what &apos;s the favor you were going to ask me ?
how &apos;d you know ?
because you called my line and not harvey &apos;s ,
and i know when my friend needs me .
so why don &apos;t you tell me how i can help ?
do you remember that time you impersonated someone for me
and almost went to prison ?
rings a bell .
i need you to do the exact same thing .
only this time i found a way to make it totally legal .
let me get this straight .
you want me to delay this man &apos;s execution
based on his own assertion from 12 years ago
that there &apos;s an alibi witness ?
your honor , we understand
that &apos;s not enough to reopen the case .
we &apos;re just asking for more time to locate the witness .
you &apos;ve had 12 years to locate the witness .
not to mention that the day the execution is set
is the day that their client just happened
to suddenly remember the witness in the first place .
he didn &apos;t suddenly remember .
he &apos;s been saying it for 12 years .
and he finally found someone who cares enough about the truth
to help him find her .
how dare you .
i care about the truth .
and i convicted a murderer .
your honor , this was a brutal murder
of two 16 @-@ year @-@ old children .
and the families of both of those children are here today
because they &apos;ve waited 12 years
for their nightmare to finally end
and there is no legal reason to prolong their suffering .
your honor ,
you have the power to push leonard bailey &apos;s execution
if you see fit .
isn &apos;t it worth doing
if there &apos;s even a 1 % chance that he is innocent ?
you have one week to find a witness .
after that , you cannot move to reopen his trial
and his execution date is set in stone .
there you are . i &apos;ve been looking for you all morning .
i had something important to do , louis .
and now i have actual work to catch up on ,
so i can &apos;t really talk to you about your date right now .
no , no . it &apos;s not about my date .
it &apos;s about harvey &apos;s case .
i know it &apos;s for mike .
what is it ?
harvey wants me to reverse engineer sutter &apos;s trades ,
but i can &apos;t do that without access to a trading database .
and we can &apos;t ask the sec
because they &apos;re supposed to be on the other side .
so why are you coming to me ?
because stu &quot; dickface &quot; buzzini has a database .
and he &apos;s the last person in the world who would help you .
donna , please , i would not be coming to you
if there was another way ,
but i have been up all night and there is no other way .
i &apos;ll take care of it , louis .
here .
what &apos;s this ?
that &apos;s my guy .
your guy ?
my private investigator .
why doesn &apos;t it say it on the card ?
because a guy that good isn &apos;t in the phone book .
listen , rachel , when you get to a certain level ,
everybody has their person .
harvey has vanessa , i have carter .
and now i do too .
no , you have him for this because we don &apos;t have time .
after that , you get your own guy .
i don &apos;t understand ,
why can &apos;t i use your guy too ?
because then he wouldn &apos;t be my guy .
what can i do for you , red ?
i &apos;m in the middle of something .
you can turn away from that screen for two seconds
and introduce yourself to me like a gentleman .
why is it anytime someone from your office comes to me ,
they &apos;ve always got some kind of comment on my manners ?
maybe that &apos;s a question you should be asking yourself .
but i don &apos;t have time to delve into why you &apos;ll never do that
because i need you to give louis litt access
to your entire securities database .
listen to me , i don &apos;t know who the hell you are ,
but why exactly am i going to do that for you ?
because when you do , i &apos;ll owe you one ,
and if you don &apos;t know it already ,
that &apos;s like anyone else owing you 50 .
i don &apos;t buy it .
then why don &apos;t you call your friend larry at merrill lynch
or kenny at morgan stanley
or howard jaffe from you know where ?
how the hell do you know about howard ?
i know about all of them .
because it &apos;s what i do .
okay , uh , you can have whatever you want .
good . and sense you questioned my abilities ,
you &apos;re not only gonna give louis that database ,
you &apos;re going to treat him with the respect he deserves
for the rest of your life .
i never did anything wrong to him .
and if you think that &apos;s true ,
then you need to take a good look in the mirror
because you violated his bullpen and his mugs .
and with the exception of my friendship ,
those are the two most important things in his entire life .
i can see by that look on your face
you &apos;re wondering who i am after all .
let me save you the trouble .
i &apos;m donna , and i &apos;m awesome .
excuse me . i think i &apos;m in the wrong room .
no , you &apos;re not .
where &apos;s kevin ?
i &apos;m his cell mate
and where he is isn &apos;t important right now .
i got a phone call from a guard
saying that my husband wanted to see me ,
and i want to know what &apos;s going on .
no , you got a phone call from someone saying
they were calling from danbury ,
which is exactly where that call was made .
and now it &apos;s exactly where i &apos;m headed out of .
i know you &apos;re helping your father make illegal trades .
what ?
you can go ahead and deny it ,
but kevin told me everything .
what do you want ?
i want to help you .
well , i don &apos;t believe you .
i don &apos;t care if you believe it or not ,
but you have a small window to come clean with the sec
and save yourself .
not that it &apos;s any of your business ,
but i would never turn on my own father .
that &apos;s too bad because if you don &apos;t ,
you &apos;re both gonna end up behind bars .
what exactly is in this for you ?
there &apos;s nothing in it for me
besides that fact that i care about kevin .
listen to me , i used to work for harvey specter ,
your father &apos;s lawyer .
if he found out that i was doing this ,
he would kill me .
and what if i tell my father about all this ?
you &apos;re not gonna do that .
because kevin already told me
that you guys are planning to go away on william &apos;s dime ,
so if your father finds out that kevin &apos;s been talking to me ,
that dime &apos;s gonna go away .
like i said , i &apos;m in the wrong room .
have a seat , bryan .
i just have a few questions ,
and then you can be on your way .
what exactly is this about ?
you don &apos;t know ?
no .
i talked to ten people here and no one will tell me a thing
except that this isn &apos;t going to be easy .
that &apos;s because the sec
got an anonymous copy of william sutter &apos;s trading program ,
and i want to find the son of a bitch who leaked it .
well , i can tell you it wasn &apos;t me .
which is exactly what those ten other clowns just said .
and i &apos;ll tell you what i told them ,
it didn &apos;t magically appear on their doorstep .
i don &apos;t care how they got it .
and if that &apos;s your only question ,
i need to get back to work .
you &apos;ll leave when i say you can leave .
what did you say ?
i said sit the hell down .
you &apos;ve been a vp for five years ,
but you took meetings at goldman and morgan last summer .
which i disclosed to mr. sutter .
i don &apos;t care . you didn &apos;t get those jobs
because they didn &apos;t want you .
and now you &apos;re pissed off the people under you
are making twice your salary ,
so you went running to the sec .
i already told you i didn &apos;t do that .
where were you three nights ago ?
i was at dinner . you can check .
was it with your old buddy , henry reese ,
who just happens to play rec @-@ league basketball
with five sec lawyers ?
i haven &apos;t seen henry in six months ,
and i &apos;m getting a little sick and tired of this interrogation .
well , i &apos;m getting sick and tired of assholes like you
not taking this thing seriously .
what ? i didn &apos;t say i wasn &apos;t taking it seriously .
yeah , i don &apos;t give a shit what you said .
i give a shit that
you start listening to what i &apos;m goddamn telling you
because when the sec gets you on the stand ,
they &apos;re going to go through your life with a fine tooth comb ,
and if you got something to hide ,
they &apos;re gonna find it .
i &apos;m sorry .
good .
get the hell out of my sight and send the next asshole in .
louis , can i talk to you for a minute ?
only if you &apos;re here to bring me what i need .
i am .
that baby will link you directly to our mainframe .
you need anything else , you come to me .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
but that &apos;s not all .
i also brought a little something
to make things right between us .
i took the liberty of updating the design .
i hope you like it .
i love it .
good . &apos; cause there &apos;s six dozen more in the file room .
fresh start , bro ?
fresh start .
hey , stu .
what exactly did donna say to get you to do all this ?
she just held up a mirror .
and the truth is , it never hurts to get a second opinion
on how you treat other people .
jessica , you were right to give me carter .
i never would have found out
what happened to maria gomez without him .
let &apos;s have it .
she filed for a name change in new jersey in 2008 .
what &apos;s her new name ?
that &apos;s just it .
carter couldn &apos;t get it .
the only reason he couldn &apos;t get it
is if the state is denying access to those records
for her own safety .
exactly .
she filed numerous restraining orders against her ex @-@ husband ,
and now her records are sealed for the next two years .
all right . i &apos;ll see if there &apos;s someone
at the newark da &apos;s office who can help us .
if not , maybe harvey knows someone .
i know someone .
my father went to law school with jim rogers ,
the newark district attorney .
and you don &apos;t want to go to your father
because you don &apos;t want to ask him for a favor .
i don &apos;t want him to keep seeing me as
some little girl who &apos;s always asking for help with something .
rachel , being a lawyer means you have to ask people for help ,
no matter who they are ,
which means if you want to let your father know
that you &apos;re not a little girl anymore ,
then show him you &apos;re not afraid to ask him for a favor .
have a seat , jennifer .
i just have a few questions ,
then you can be on your way .
i think i &apos;ll stand .
you &apos;re not jennifer .
no , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m not sending another person in here
until you tell me what the hell you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m doing what i said i was gonna do .
you said you would shake the trees ,
not burn down the whole forest .
listen to me--
no , you listen to me .
you &apos;re driving my people away , and that ends now .
william , i don &apos;t think you understand ,
the sooner the son of a bitch who leaked this thing
stops helping them ,
the better for us .
what makes you think whoever it is
is gonna stop helping them ?
look , they handed it in anonymously ,
which means whoever this asshole is ,
the one thing they showed us is , he &apos;s a coward .
and the only way to stop a coward
is to scare the shit out of them .
well , if winning my case means losing all my employees ,
then forget about the whole thing .
william , we can &apos;t stop--
that &apos;s enough .
instead of looking for someone
who did something they already did ,
you &apos;re gonna get back to preparing my defense .
the next time i see you ,
you &apos;d better be giving the most kick @-@ ass opening statement
the world &apos;s ever seen .
what the hell did you do ?
all right , kevin , let me explain .
explain what ? that you called my wife in here
pretending to be me ?
just listen to me , i &apos;m--
you know , i can &apos;t believe you , man .
i told you not to tell anyone what we talked about .
and i didn &apos;t tell anyone who didn &apos;t already know .
and i don &apos;t give a shit
because this is none of your goddamn business .
yeah , well , i made it my goddamn business
because there is a freight train headed right at you ,
and if i didn &apos;t do everything i could to stop it ,
i wouldn &apos;t be able to live with myself .
yeah , well , you didn &apos;t stop it .
you slammed it right into my marriage
because jill and i ,
we haven &apos;t fought like we just did
since the night that landed me in here ,
so from now on ,
take your goddamn good intentions and go to hell .
you know what ? you should be thanking me .
thanking you for what ? screwing up my life ?
in case you haven &apos;t noticed , your life is already screwed up .
you &apos;re in here because of some other guy &apos;s crime ,
and if he gets caught , you &apos;re gonna be in here together .
and then all of that fictional money
that he &apos;s dangling in front of you
isn &apos;t gonna be there anymore .
now i get why you &apos;re going through all this trouble .
you regret that you took a deal for someone ,
and he &apos;s out there while you &apos;re in here .
well , i don &apos;t .
because i didn &apos;t take this deal for that son of a bitch ,
i took it for my wife , who i love ,
and if you ever contact her again without my blessing ,
i swear to god i will beat the shit out of you .
donna , where the hell is louis ?
he &apos;s working on what you wanted .
well , find him because i need him .
harvey , what &apos;s the matter ?
what &apos;s the matter is , i just spent the whole day at sutter &apos;s
trying to flush out whoever &apos;s in on this with him ,
and i got nowhere .
i don &apos;t understand . it &apos;s gonna take time .
this was only one day .
which would be true , except sutter shut me down
and i don &apos;t have another day .
and like i said , while i was there ,
i didn &apos;t see a guilty look on a single person &apos;s face .
because the person you &apos;re looking for
doesn &apos;t work for william sutter .
holy shit . you found him ?
i didn &apos;t just find him . i got backup .
the one commonality on all the trades sutter made money on
was they preceded some sort of transaction
involving an investment bank .
i know that , but there were 50 different trades
with 20 different banks .
20 different agent banks .
what the hell other kind of bank is there ?
the kind of bank you hire to give you a second opinion .
holy shit , the consulting banks .
exactly , which , by the way ,
are not required to be disclosed .
how many different banks were they ?
just one . and that bank &apos;s consulting division
happens to be run by a man whose first job on wall street
was working for william sutter .
sorry to be showing up at your place again , sean ,
but this can &apos;t wait .
that &apos;s okay , harvey . you caught me in a good mood .
well , i &apos;m about to make it better
because we found the guy
who &apos;s been feeding sutter his information .
his name is--
phillip allen , i know .
how do you know ?
he came by to cut a deal two hours ago ,
so i gave him one .
no , you goddamn didn &apos;t .
what &apos;s your problem ?
my problem is , i drove him to you .
so what ? we &apos;re at the finish line , harvey .
this is what we &apos;ve been after the whole time .
this is what you &apos;ve been after this whole time .
what i &apos;ve been after is getting mike out ,
so if you think you can weasel out of this deal after--
harvey , relax .
as far as the sec is concerned ,
mike led directly to the witness .
that &apos;s going to put that piece of shit away
for the rest of his miserable life .
so mike &apos;s deal is still intact ?
rock solid .
we got him , harvey .
the good guys won .
then i guess the next time you see me ,
i &apos;m gonna be pretending to be outraged
that you hadn &apos;t notified us of your new witness .
and i &apos;ll be pretending to be outraged
at whatever bullshit you &apos;re trying to pull .
well , i &apos;ll try not to be too outrageous .
you do that .
thanks , sean .
you &apos;re welcome , harvey .
rachel .
did i mess something up ?
i didn &apos;t think we had plans tonight .
i &apos;m not here for plans .
then what are you here for ?
i need your help with a case .
you &apos;re not seriously asking me to help my rival firm , are you ?
no , it &apos;s not corporate .
this is from the innocence project
and since when did jessica pearson
take on an innocence project case ?
since i asked her to .
well , that &apos;s great , rachel . i &apos;m proud of you .
what do you need ?
there &apos;s a privacy statute in the state of new jersey
that &apos;s preventing me from finding a witness .
and jim rogers won &apos;t take a call from you ,
but he will from me .
exactly . and if you do this for me ,
i will owe you one .
rachel , you &apos;re my daughter . you &apos;ll never owe me one .
mm @-@ mm . i &apos;m not here as your daughter .
i &apos;m here as a lawyer .
then don &apos;t forget this .
because someday , i &apos;m gonna come calling .
mike , sit down .
i hope you didn &apos;t come all the way down here
just to tell me that we &apos;re running out of time ,
&apos;cause i already know that .
i didn &apos;t . i came here to tell you that we got the guy .
what guy ?
the guy who &apos;s been feeding
inside information to sutter , and i drove him to cahill ,
which means you &apos;re getting out .
mike , did you hear me ? you &apos;re getting out .
no , i @-@ i know . i ...
look , the problem is that if you &apos;re gonna get sutter ,
you &apos;re also gonna get kevin &apos;s wife .
what the hell are you talking about ?
kevin told me that the reason he never cut a deal
was because his wife was in on it .
are you kidding me ? you &apos;ve been keeping this to yourself ?
i haven &apos;t just been keeping it to myself .
i also tried to convince kevin and jill to both come clean .
both of them ? you went to her ?
harvey , listen to me--
no , you listen to me .
i don &apos;t give a shit what your conscience is telling you .
we got the guy . we &apos;re gonna take him down .
that means you get out .
i know that , and i love that .
but all i need you to do is convince cahill
to cut jill a deal too .
i don &apos;t think you understand .
this guy came forward .
he &apos;s the guy that gets the deal ,
and you &apos;re the guy that gets the deal .
there &apos;s no third deal .
harvey , please .
i &apos;ve betrayed this man enough .
i need you to convince cahill that one person makes a case ,
but two people is a slam dunk .
okay , mike . i &apos;ll make it happen .
louis ? do you have a second ?
actually , i don &apos;t , donna , because i &apos;m going
on the most important date of my life tonight ,
and i have no idea where i &apos;m taking her .
yes , you do .
never heard of this place .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s an intimate restaurant
that &apos;s been there 50 years and no one knows about it .
which makes it the perfect place to get to know someone
you think you might be falling in love with .
donna , i need to blow her away .
no , louis , you need to let her get to know you
and let fate take care of the rest .
what if i &apos;m not good enough ?
you are good enough .
hey , i thought you were too busy to help .
the truth is , when you asked me for help ,
it wasn &apos;t a great morning for me to be thinking
about that kind of thing .
i don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;ve been seeing someone for the last few months ,
and we broke up .
tell me the son of a bitch &apos;s name right now
and i &apos;m gonna freeze his assets by the end of the week .
his name is mitchell , and you don &apos;t have to do that .
yes , i do , donna . you &apos;re everything to me ,
and that asshole has no idea what he &apos;s got--
it was my decision , louis .
well then , why were you so upset ?
it &apos;s the same thing it was with you and sheila .
just because you were the one to break it off with her
doesn &apos;t mean that your heart wasn &apos;t still broken .
i love you , donna .
i love you too , louis .
sir , may i help you ?
yes , you can direct me to jessica pearson .
ms. pearson &apos;s gone for the evening ,
but i can take down your information
and she &apos;ll get back to you in the morning .
you &apos;re not taking anything down .
i need to speak with someone now .
you can speak with me , mr. forrest .
i assume you &apos;re here to talk about leonard bailey .
i &apos;m here to show you this .
this is what that man did to my daughter .
mr. forrest , i know that this must be incredibly difficult .
and it may not seem that way to you ,
but i am seeking justice for your daughter .
we got justice when that animal was sentenced to death ,
so don &apos;t you try to tell me you &apos;re doing this for her .
i &apos;m doing this for everyone .
the case was grossly mishandled .
that &apos;s not for you to decide .
you &apos;re right , sir .
it &apos;s for a jury to decide .
a jury did decide !
and they weren &apos;t presented with all of the facts .
the facts are he killed my girl !
mr. forrest , i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
but i believe in my heart that leonard bailey is innocent .
and i &apos;m going to make sure
that he gets the fair trial that he never had .
by tracking down some junkie witness ?
drug user or not ,
maria gomez never had a chance to be heard .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i need to go to my office .
i &apos;m not going anywhere !
not until you understand that if you are sorry for me ,
you wouldn &apos;t have taken this case on in the first place
instead of using it to make a name for yourself .
that &apos;s enough .
you said everything you needed to say ,
now walk yourself out of here
before i have security remove you .
you all right ?
i will be . thank you , gretchen .
can we talk ?
there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
there is for me .
all right then , go ahead .
it won &apos;t make any difference
&apos;cause i already put in for a transfer .
you &apos;re moving to another cell ?
yeah , i am .
so whatever it is you &apos;re gonna say ,
let &apos;s just pretend you said it , and i let it go ,
and we move in our separate directions , okay ?
no , i can &apos;t do that .
why not ?
because you were right .
i am pissed that i took a deal to save other people .
and now i &apos;m sitting in here for two goddamn years
while they &apos;re out there .
if you still want to transfer cells , i get it .
i won &apos;t hold any hard feelings .
i want you to know that hurting you and jill
is the last thing that i wanted to do .
i &apos;m gonna head to movie night .
i hope to see you there .
jessica , i thought you went home for the night .
i came back .
i heard you had some trouble with the victim &apos;s father .
gretchen told you .
yes , she did .
and i &apos;m glad she did .
did he threaten you ?
no .
i guess i should have told you .
people don &apos;t always act rationally when they &apos;re suffering .
they look for someone to blame .
yeah , well , he &apos;s blaming me .
yes , he is .
and he &apos;s wrong .
i know .
and that &apos;s an easy thing to understand .
but a harder thing to endure .
well , it just got a little bit easier
knowing that you &apos;re in it with me .
let &apos;s go get a drink .
after what happened before , i think i might have two .
louis , this place is ...
it &apos;s too quiet in here , isn &apos;t it ?
the seats aren &apos;t padded .
and you hate it , i know it .
no , louis , it &apos;s perfect .
it &apos;s exactly what i &apos;d hoped for .
well , i wanted to show you how much you mean to me .
louis ...
i get it .
you don &apos;t feel the same way .
it &apos;s not that .
i have something to tell you ,
and i didn &apos;t know how to bring it up .
or even when ,
but you made such a romantic gesture
that it--it feels wrong not to tell you about it .
what is it ?
i have a boyfriend who lives in los angeles six months of the year .
we care about each other deeply ,
but living across the country takes its toll .
so we came up with an arrangement
where we allow each other to see other people .
you &apos;re saying you want to date both of us ?
i know it sounds crazy .
the truth is , i &apos;ve never actually taken him up on it .
but then i met you , and here we are .
louis , please say something .
i need a second .
i @-@ i understand if you want to go .
no . i &apos;d like to stay .
do you want to go for dinner or just drinks ?
what do you want ?
the truth ? i &apos;d rather just go to a dive bar .
sounds perfect to me .
dad ? what are you doing here ?
i came to talk to both of you .
what is it ?
jim rogers found your missing witness .
she died three years ago .
hey , look who it is .
i &apos;m headed to movie night , gallo .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
this will just take a second .
i won &apos;t even make you miss the previews .
let &apos;s get this over with .
it &apos;s been brought to my attention
that harvey came to visit you , not me , again today .
and like i told you ,
he came here to talk about my case .
yeah , that &apos;s what you said the last time .
but i got to thinking .
and the thing is , you took a deal ,
which means you don &apos;t have a case .
gallo , look , i &apos;m telling you ,
harvey is going to get you out .
i know he is .
because i know what you &apos;re up to in here .
and the reason i know is because i did the same thing myself .
what are you talking--
you &apos;re informing on your roommate .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . this is--
don &apos;t i ? everybody in here knows
that guy &apos;s taken it out .
it doesn &apos;t take a genius to figure out you have access to him .
so i did some checking .
turns out harvey &apos;s representing the kid &apos;s daddy @-@ in @-@ law .
and i know harvey does dirty tricks
because that &apos;s what landed me in here .
gallo--
you guys are going after sutter .
i know it , and you know it .
and i &apos;ll tell you something else ,
you don &apos;t get me out of here soon ,
your bunkmate &apos;s gonna know it too .
sean , good , you &apos;re here .
i need you to do something for me
and you &apos;re not gonna like it .
harvey , i need you to sit down .
what do you mean , sit down ?
they pulled mike &apos;s deal .
what did you just say to me ?
harvey--
&apos;cause it sounded like you just said
that think that you told me was rock solid
was nothing more than a bucket of shit .
what do you want me to say ?
i want you to say you &apos;ll get his deal back .
i can &apos;t do that . they pulled the plug .
goddamn it . i drove that guy to you .
don &apos;t you think that i know that ?
but if i tell them that ,
they &apos;re gonna know what we did .
then don &apos;t use phillip allen . cut him loose ,
and let mike get you what you need .
are you crazy ?
even if i wanted to do that ,
they &apos;re not gonna let their star witness get away .
you are the head of the department .
they will listen to you .
you tell them this guy turned out to be full of shit .
then let me put it a different way .
i &apos;m not letting my star witness get away
&apos;cause i &apos;m not letting that bastard get away
with bilking people out of their hard @-@ earned money .
sean , please ,
there &apos;s gotta be another way to make this happen .
i &apos;m sorry , harvey . there isn &apos;t .
then get the hell out of my sight .
