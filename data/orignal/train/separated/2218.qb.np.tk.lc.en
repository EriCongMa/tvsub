you don &apos;t have to do this .
i just need more time .
mr. shioma has given you
over a month to make good on your debt .
time &apos;s up .
i &apos;d like to report two murders .
you can find the bodies in the makua kea &apos;au forest reserve .
how do you know this ?
&apos;cause i put them there .
prosecutor &apos;s last and final offer was 18 months .
okay .
we accepted .
before you think of saying anything , know this ,
i have people outside your house , right now ,
and if they don &apos;t hear from me in exactly ten minutes ,
she &apos;s dead .
what do you want ?
help me .
thanks for coming , brah .
yeah . is nahele all right ?
your text message said it was an emergency .
that &apos;s the emergency ?
i @-@ i was just following orders .
it is an emergency , bruddah .
if i don &apos;t get to waikiki food fest within the hour ,
simmy &apos;s shrimp shack &apos;s gonna jump my spot .
an emergency is @-@ is a life @-@ or @-@ death situation .
you understand that ?
this is ... this is a flat tire .
it &apos;s called an economic crisis .
an economic crisis ?
if i don &apos;t sell shrimp , nahele don &apos;t get paid .
nahele don &apos;t get paid ,
he looks for alternative sources of income ,
which might directly impact your financial situation .
is that right ?
trickle @-@ down economics , brah .
there &apos;s a jack in my truck in the toolbox .
what &apos;d i tell you , kid ?
superman to the rescue .
mcgarrett .
kono , what do we know ?
there was a chemical spill on the road outside halawa prison
that forced an emergency evacuation
to the marine corps barracks at kaneohe bay .
that &apos;s over a thousand inmates .
that &apos;s why they were using the city buses .
yeah , corrections ran out of vehicles ,
so the mayor commandeered these buses to help out .
on the way to the brig ,
this one was hit with what appears to be a remote @-@ controlled ied .
we got the exact casualty count ?
ten prisoners , one guard dead , dozens injured .
and then there &apos;s this guy .
meet james hamasaki .
this guy was doing time for weapons and drug trafficking .
talk about unlucky .
by some miracle , this guy survives the blast ,
only to be the unlucky recipient of a double tap .
now , witnesses say that our shooter was stalking through
the wreckage just moments after the blast ,
but nobody can give us enough information to get an i.d.
okay , so wait a minute , you &apos;re telling me
that the chemical spill and the attack on this bus
was all part of a coordinated hit ?
yeah , i &apos;m thinking
the shooter was just insurance to make sure the job got done .
steve , we got runners .
corrections identified six inmates unaccounted for ,
and the guard &apos;s gun is missing .
so i guess we got armed runners .
what &apos;s the matter , duke ?
kono , one of the fugitives is your husband .
all right , everybody , listen up .
we have the identities of the six escaped inmates .
we believe these men are still traveling together
and shackled in pairs .
we also have reason to believe
that one of them is armed with a handgun ,
so look sharp when you &apos;re out there .
they are identified as : gerard burns , 61 years old .
this guy &apos;s convicted of first @-@ degree murder
in the killing of his wife .
he &apos;s a former defense attorney
to some of the island &apos;s worst criminals .
next up , bobby stockman .
this guy &apos;s a serial rapist , convicted .
currently , he &apos;s done five years
of his 162 @-@ year sentence .
now meet efrin aquino .
he &apos;s currently serving three life terms
for a triple homicide that happened back in 2002 .
i &apos;m sure most of you know this guy , henry garavito .
for those of you who haven &apos;t had the pleasure ,
mr. garavito has spent the last 15 years of his life
in solitary confinement after slaughtering two families
and cannibalizing all of his victims .
we also have serial torch , jason duclair .
duclair is currently serving multiple life sentences
for various counts of murder and arson .
that said , we are gonna have fire @-@ fighting support ,
helos standing by ,
just in case he gets the itch while he &apos;s out there .
lastly , we got adam noshimuri .
mr. noshimuri was housed in a protective @-@ custody dormitory
right next to the maximum @-@ security wing .
now , somehow , he and some of his fellow inmates
were mixed up with the other max prisoners on that bus .
please note that right now we believe mr. noshimuri
was forced to go along with the other fugitives .
is that clear ? good .
swat is currently tied up helping corrections
with the prison evac .
aviation is up , but the k @-@ 9s are still 15 to 20 out .
we &apos;re not waiting for the dogs , all right ?
we got to move .
these guys have got a big head start on us already .
if we want to catch them before the sun goes down ,
we got to move right now , got it ?
kono .
all right , so the escapees were last seen headed north .
so far , they &apos;ve avoided h @-@ 3 to the west ,
which is already crawling with hpd checkpoints .
there are two other possible
escape @-@ route scenarios based on distance and terrain .
there are some old , off @-@ the @-@ grid campsites
and hunting cabins in this area
where they could possibly obtain weapons and supplies ,
or they could continue moving north
to the town of ahuimanu and highway 83 .
yeah , obviously this is a residential area .
we don &apos;t want the bad guys getting in there .
all right ? let &apos;s go .
chin , what &apos;s up ?
hey , steve .
max &apos;s prelim on hamasaki uncovered something very interesting .
this wasn &apos;t the first attempt on his life .
apparently , he suffered a very serious stab wound
to the abdomen two months ago .
that explains why he was in protective custody , right ?
mm @-@ hmm . corrections is sending over the case file .
let &apos;s look into anybody who had contact with him
inside or outside of that prison .
already got jerry on that .
listen , steve , there &apos;s something else you should know .
what ?
nahele &apos;s father was one of the inmates on the bus .
he didn &apos;t make it .
does nahele know ?
no .
thought you &apos;d want to be the one to tell him .
all right .
wait , there , there .
everybody move .
get under there !
you gonna pray for us to make it out of here alive ?
no . i &apos;m gonna give you something
to tie that bandage with .
thank you .
we can &apos;t keep running around this jungle .
here .
there &apos;s no way we &apos;re gonna get away from the cops ,
not like this .
we need a plan .
yeah , he &apos;s right .
they &apos;ll be up here with dogs soon .
if we don &apos;t get these shackles off ,
we &apos;ll never stay ahead of them .
you know , i used to camp up here with my uncle when i was a kid .
if we keep heading north to higher ground ,
we &apos;re gonna find some hunting cabins and campsites .
we &apos;ll find something to break these chains ,
maybe food and water .
sounds like the counselor here has got a plan .
okay , let &apos;s move .
all right .
get up .
look , just give me a minute .
get your ass up now ,
or we &apos;re gonna break your neck and carry you .
if you let him stop the bleeding , he walks faster .
we all want that , right ?
he &apos;s right .
make it quick .
you guys keep moving . we &apos;ll catch up .
okay , so the stabbing of hamasaki happened in the prison
laundry room , away from cameras and guards .
there were four witnesses .
conveniently , they all came down with a case of amnesia .
ah . i &apos;m guessing hamasaki wouldn &apos;t i.d. his attacker .
no , snitches get stitches .
but here &apos;s where it gets weird .
in the weeks before the assault ,
hamasaki was visited over a dozen times by this guy .
he signed in as reid garner ,
hamasaki &apos;s attorney .
all right , what &apos;s weird about that ?
there &apos;s no reid garner listed
as a licensed attorney in the great state of hawaii .
so i ran him through facial rec ,
and as you may have guessed ,
his name is not reid garner , and he &apos;s not an attorney .
then who the hell is he ?
gentlemen .
special agent ed scanlon . how can i help you ?
we need to know about the case you &apos;re working
with james hamasaki .
he was cooperating in a federal rico case
targeting one of his former associates ,
uh , anthony palumbo .
james was supposed to testify against him
in a federal grand jury last week .
he got cold feet and bailed at the last minute .
i &apos;m sure the sharp instrument
inserted into his ribs contributed to that decision .
hamasaki was killed this morning
on his way from halawa prison
to the marine barracks at kaneohe bay .
that ied attack on the corrections bus ?
we think he was the target .
but it &apos;s strange that palumbo would take him out
knowing he decided not to testify .
so who put the hit on hamasaki ?
what was that look ?
was that a look ?
yeah .
oh , i was just wondering why the man with ...
the man with a thousand opinions
has suddenly turned into a buddhist monk .
you haven &apos;t said two words since we left the command post .
well , maybe that &apos;s because i don &apos;t have anything to say .
oh , really ?
yeah , really .
maybe you know i &apos;m not gonna like
what you have to say .
all right , let me ask you a question .
i understand , okay ?
i understand adam is shackled to duclair
and he had no choice , but what if he did ?
what if he was using this as an opportunity to run ?
why would he turn himself in
and take a plea deal if he &apos;s just gonna run ?
doesn &apos;t make any sense .
okay , i &apos;ll tell you why .
maybe ... maybe it has something to do
with the fact that he had a sit @-@ down with gabriel waincroft ,
didn &apos;t tell anybody , not even kono ,
until he was asked about it . how about that ?
he &apos;s got 14 months left on his sentence , okay ?
he &apos;s not gonna throw that away for a fugitive play .
besides , he wouldn &apos;t do that to kono .
oh , no ?
i understand that once you are a criminal ,
you are always a criminal .
old life calls , okay ?
need a little help carrying the weight of the world
on your shoulders there , atlas ?
i &apos;m just thinking about adam .
adam had to run . he didn &apos;t have a choice .
come on , you know that , don &apos;t you ?
i do , and then my mind starts
wandering into all that stuff with gabriel and then i don &apos;t .
well , let me give you a little advice .
follow your first instinct . your husband &apos;s a good guy .
i know that and you know that , too , more importantly .
he was protecting you by leaving you out of the loop ,
and now he &apos;s doing what he &apos;s got to do to stay alive
and protecting himself .
it &apos;s just that simple .
so ... i did some digging into hamasaki ,
and check this out .
you recognize this guy ?
yeah . solomon tuasopo .
he &apos;s the guard that let gabriel into halawa to visit adam .
what &apos;s he got to do with hamasaki ?
nothing .
but he was also the guard
assigned to special holding this morning .
he put adam and some other protective custody inmates
on a bus with prisoners from maximum security .
according to halawa chief of security ,
that should never have happened .
okay . where are you going with this , jer ?
i have a theory , if you don &apos;t mind .
who does this look like to you ?
our victim hamasaki .
right . but who else does it look like ?
i don &apos;t know . who ?
i &apos;ll give you a hint .
they could pass as brothers , right ?
i guess , yeah .
which leads me to my theory .
with all the chaos ,
the smoke , the fire , blood everywhere ,
same striped jumpsuits , same physical appearance ...
hamasaki wasn &apos;t the target .
it was adam .
chin , are you sure they were trying to kill adam ?
it &apos;s the only theory that makes any sense right now .
we &apos;re bringing tuasopo in .
he &apos;s the guard that put adam on the bus .
i want to know who paid him to do it .
that &apos;s easy .
it was waincroft .
he crawled out from under his rock
and he &apos;s orchestrating the whole damn thing .
yeah , well , if gabriel &apos;s behind it ,
obviously adam turned down his offer to partner up .
no way it was gabriel .
last time we saw this guy ,
he &apos;s doing a gainer out of a window .
he bounced off a car hood .
he &apos;s half dead , he &apos;s got no money ;
he ain &apos;t putting a hit on anybody .
okay . well , it &apos;s not gabriel ,
who wants adam dead ?
mcgarrett !
chin , i got to call you back .
look at this .
look at all this blood .
at least one of these guys is hurt bad .
guys , i got something over here .
this is the prayer beads off of adam &apos;s necklace .
it must &apos;ve broken .
guys .
got fresh tracks over here . they split up .
you got a house on the north shore .
you got two kids in private school .
either you really know how to stretch
that state correctional buck ,
or you &apos;re on somebody &apos;s payroll .
you know what i learned
from talking to people like you , solomon ?
that even the worst men who have sat in that chair ...
they all have someone they care about .
someone they love .
now , for you ...
you got two boys at the iolani school , right ?
that &apos;s 40 grand a year in tuition .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s a lot of love .
for me , it &apos;s kono .
i mean , you know , she &apos;s like the sister i never had .
but maybe you didn &apos;t know
that the man you had set up to be killed this morning
is her husband .
that makes him &apos; ohana .
and that makes this very , very personal .
so if you ever want to
see your children again without
a piece of glass and a telephone between you and them ,
you &apos;re gonna tell me who paid you
to put adam noshimuri on that bus .
where are garavito and aquino ?
they should &apos;ve caught up to us by now .
maybe the cops grabbed them .
who cares ?
all they did was slow us down anyway .
all right .
hold still .
forget it .
that &apos;s not gonna cut through cold steel .
you got a better idea ?
yeah .
heat up the chain , make it softer .
this is priceless .
the pyro wants to start a fire .
does anyone else think that &apos;s , like , a really bad idea ?
look , the man &apos;s right .
the cops will see the smoke .
not if we build the fire upside down .
of course . an upside @-@ down fire .
i mean , why didn &apos;t i think of that ?
everybody on your heads .
be smart .
shut up .
gather up the bigger logs .
start with those .
smaller logs on top ,
kindling on top of that .
this way , the fire burns down instead of up .
the heat on top
eats up all the gases from underneath .
trust me .
tuasopo &apos;s more afraid of
whoever &apos;s paying him than he is of going to jail .
he &apos;s not talking .
well , his money definitely is .
i found large deposits
into accounts under his wife &apos;s maiden name .
only problem is , there &apos;s no connection
to who we thought was behind this ,
gabriel waincroft .
the money was wired from offshore accounts
科乐美 · 艾兰娜 当前所有转账记录
controlled by the man he murdered ,
late yakuza boss goro shioma .
so whoever filled shioma &apos;s shoes
is the one who ordered the hit on adam .
let &apos;s get on with this . my hand is on fire !
not yet .
i &apos;d rather keep the chain than lose the hand !
okay , over there .
go !
well , i guess i owe you an apology .
i just want you to stay out of my face .
that &apos;s all i want .
where &apos;s aquino ?
we got lost .
cut across a stream and he slipped on a rock .
cracked his head wide open . it was real bad .
blood everywhere .
he quit breathing .
how &apos;d you get the chain off ?
i had no choice .
you sick son of a bitch !
i did what i had to do .
get back !
easy . come on .
there &apos;s nothing we can do about it now .
i did what i had to do .
i can walk 18 holes on a golf course , not blink an eye .
i &apos;m lying . i take a cart every time .
what i &apos;m trying to say is
this hiking is kicking my ass .
well , i guess it is better than walking a beat in chicago
on rush street in the middle of winter .
i do not miss that . i tell you what .
waking up in double digits below zero .
weather forecast for the day is :
popsicle toes .
i can &apos;t feel my face .
i don &apos;t know .
i could do with a little cold weather right now .
kono .
i see it .
i got blood and drag marks .
what is this ?
hang on . what is this ?
oh , it &apos;s a body .
it &apos;s aquino .
yeah .
i guess garavito prefers his own company .
hang on .
where is his hand ?
it &apos;s over here .
gentlemen , as much as i &apos;ve enjoyed the company ,
think i &apos;m gonna head out on my own .
splitting up will only increase our chances of getting caught .
no one &apos;s asking your opinion .
the man &apos;s right .
we should stay together
until we get to the highway .
the man eats people .
i think that disqualifies him as someone we should listen to .
this guy turned himself in the last time he escaped .
he doesn &apos;t care if he gets caught .
the cops grab him ,
he &apos;s liable to tell them which way we &apos;re headed .
we can &apos;t let him go .
who &apos;s gonna stop me ? you ?
i am .
give him the hatchet .
keep that handy .
i &apos;m gonna need it later when i kill you .
shoot him !
blow his damn brains out !
this guy is a liability !
all right , shut up !
no one &apos;s killing anyone .
put the gun down .
everybody , just take a deep breath .
give me the gun !
i &apos;ll do it !
you pull that trigger ,
and you &apos;ll tell the cops exactly where we are ,
quicker than duclair ever could .
trust me , they &apos;re out there , listening .
they &apos;re waiting for us to give up our location .
that gun leads them right to us .
let &apos;s go .
before i change my mind .
wait , hold on .
how far is that stream ?
it &apos;s not far-- half a mile . why ?
we &apos;re heading to higher ground .
we need to fill these bottles .
we &apos;re not gonna get very far without water .
okay .
but only burns goes .
no offense , but , uh , i don &apos;t know you .
so i trust you even less than these guys .
if the yakuza put a hit out on adam ,
it had to be because he was working with gabriel .
or because shioma thought he was .
well , they &apos;d have to have
solid intel to come at him this strong .
you know ? and it &apos;d be another reason why adam &apos;s running .
did you hear what i said ?
yeah , i heard what you said .
i &apos;m not saying you &apos;re wrong . did i say you &apos;re wrong ?
no , you didn &apos;t , but then what would be the opposite of that ?
the word opposite of ...
why can &apos;t you just say i &apos;m right ?
say , &quot; you &apos;re right about something . &quot;
why can &apos;t you say that ?
why ?
am i , am i speaking to myself ?
why can &apos;t you say that ?
because you &apos;re wrong .
adam &apos;s not running .
he &apos;s leaving a trail for us to find him .
are you crazy ?
i thought you were the cops .
sorry . they sent me to find you .
stockman &apos;s anxious to get moving .
he needs to relax . i &apos;m not done here .
all right , let me help .
all right , thanks .
what &apos;s taking them so long ?
asking that every minute
ain &apos;t gonna get them here any faster .
oh , i &apos;d shut up if i were you .
you got a problem with me ?
yeah , i do .
how &apos;s a guy with two bodies on him
get only 18 months in protective custody , hmm ?
answer him .
the government had a weak case ; i took a plea .
or maybe you used some of that noshimuri money
to get yourself a comfy little sentence , huh ?
yeah , you got that wrong , friend .
yakuza slit my brother &apos;s throat three years ago
over a gambling debt .
let &apos;s get one thing straight .
i ain &apos;t your friend .
no .
i &apos;m sorry about your brother .
where the hell have you been ? !
looking for burns .
he wasn &apos;t at the stream .
we &apos;ve wasted enough time . we got to go .
yeah , we have to assume the cops got to him .
all right !
let &apos;s move .
who is she ?
michelle shioma , goro &apos;s oldest daughter .
married mother of two ,
masters in business admin ,
soccer mom , president of the pta .
model citizen , until you get to these bank transactions .
the money used to pay off tuasopo came from her ?
uh @-@ huh . his account &apos;s under her direct control .
i checked with the head of security at the branch
where the wire transfers originated .
michelle was physically present and signed for them .
and there &apos;s security footage to prove it .
she &apos;s out to avenge her father &apos;s death .
so why put adam in the crosshairs ?
i &apos;m thinking she found out
about gabriel &apos;s meeting with adam ,
and figured that the two of them were in business .
so that makes him an enemy of the family .
michelle shioma .
lieutenant kelly , five @-@ 0 .
i need you to step out of the vehicle , please .
lieutenant , as you can see ,
i &apos;m driving my children home from school .
if you need anything from me ,
i suggest you call my attorney .
why don &apos;t you hold onto that and call him yourself .
your girls are gonna need a ride home .
step out of the vehicle , please .
you &apos;re not nearly as sharp as your father , michelle .
see , your father knew how to cover his tracks .
he never would &apos;ve been careless enough to leave
the paper trail that you did ,
leading straight to tuasopo &apos;s bank account .
and your father would &apos;ve known that tuasopo
was also on gabriel &apos;s payroll .
did you know he was the same guard who slipped
gabriel into halawa to meet with adam noshimuri ?
you didn &apos;t know that , did you ?
tuasopo played you , michelle .
he saw the chance to make a few extra bucks ,
so he told you about gabriel &apos;s partnership offer to adam .
but what he didn &apos;t tell you was that adam said no .
so all of this was for nothing .
but you didn &apos;t know that .
you just knew that gabriel was in hiding
and that adam was in protective custody ,
so you needed to make your play .
and that &apos;s where things got messy .
well , literally , because you did set up the chemical spill .
and you were the one to pay tuasopo to put adam on that bus .
but the ied didn &apos;t quite do its job , did it ?
and the hit man ?
he tagged the wrong guy .
that &apos;s a very amusing story , lieutenant .
the only part of it that made any sense to me
is the part about the kind woman
depositing money into a dear friend &apos;s account to help pay
for a decent education for his children .
if that &apos;s a crime ,
then ... i &apos;m guilty .
is that really the story you &apos;re sticking with ?
lieutenant ,
you seem to know my father very well .
but not the fact that for the last five years of his life ,
he wasn &apos;t very active in the business .
you see , he left the day @-@ to @-@ day
to the person he trusted most .
the one person he knew would do ...
whatever was necessary to protect our family &apos;s interests ,
no matter how heavily it weighs on their conscience .
is that a threat ?
all right , judging by this fire ,
they were here in the last two hours .
if they &apos;re no longer shackled ,
they &apos;re gonna be moving a hell of a lot quicker .
we got to pick up the pace .
aquino &apos;s dead .
yeah , we found his body about a mile back .
we followed the blood trail ; led us right back here to you .
garavito smashed his head in with a rock .
and that ain &apos;t all .
he chewed off aquino &apos;s hand at the wrist to get free .
okay .
he &apos;s not the only one off his chains .
well , so much for the advantage .
no , we still got one .
what are those ?
adam &apos;s been leaving us a trail .
what i tell you ?
now , let &apos;s go find them .
whoa , whoa , whoa , hold on . stop .
i get that this garavito is a psychopath ,
nut job , maniac or whatever , but i don &apos;t get it .
he kills the guy that he &apos;s chained to .
and instead of disappearing ,
he doubles back and rejoins the group-- why ?
strength in numbers .
no .
he &apos;s not done killing .
chin , hey . how &apos;d you do with the shioma woman ?
oh , you &apos;d love her .
she &apos;s beautiful , sophisticated ...
and she &apos;d shoot you in the face
just to make sure the gun worked .
while chin was getting the silent treatment ,
i ran her cell records .
there were dozens of incoming calls to her phone
before and after the attack on the bus .
these calls were pinging cell towers
in the area of your crime scene .
and we triangulated on those gps signals .
there are at least four active signals
within a mile of your current location .
steve , we believe those are
troops on the ground looking for adam .
we &apos;ve got company . we gonna move .
come on , hurry up ! you &apos;re holding us up !
hey ! are you crazy ? !
what are you doing ?
what &apos;d you do that for ?
he murdered burns and probably aquino , too .
what are you talking about ?
there was fresh blood on his pants ,
and he stopped bleeding hours ago .
and where do you think he got this ?
you gave it to burns .
think about it .
why would burns run off ?
he had no reason .
garavito killed him ,
and he came back to kill the rest of us .
where the hell are you going ? !
move , you die .
easy , easy .
i &apos;m not running .
i &apos;m not running .
my name is adam noshimuri .
we know who you are .
on your knees , hands over your head .
i &apos;m unarmed .
i surrender .
shut up !
you guys aren &apos;t real cops , are you ?
whoever &apos;s paying you to do this , i &apos;ll double it .
with what , mr. noshimuri ?
everyone knows you have nothing left .
you think i gave everything to shioma , you &apos;re wrong .
i think you &apos;d say anything right now to stay alive .
now we &apos;re even .
call max ,
tell him we got another body .
what was that ?
nothing .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s fine . everything &apos;s fine .
don &apos;t lie to me .
whatever happened , just tell me .
they found burns &apos;s body by a creek
a couple miles back .
was it garavito ?
he opened the guy &apos;s chest up
with a broken bottle and ate his heart .
he &apos;s not gonna stop until he kills every one of them .
i &apos;m not a real cop .
doesn &apos;t matter .
people who i work for will never ...
hey , garavito !
drop the knife !
put down the knife !
yeah , i need an immediate medical evacuation .
sending location now .
thank you .
shut up .
how many more are with you ?
burns said you turned yourself in last time you escaped .
that &apos;s right .
so why &apos;d you run this time ?
thought the best place for me was on the inside .
i was wrong .
it took you guys long enough .
you all right ?
yeah .
this is captain grover .
i need a medevac for a gunshot wound
on a male escaped convict , jason duclair .
copy that . medevac on the way .
looks like my ride &apos;s here .
come here .
no more secrets .
no more secrets .
we &apos;re gonna make it .
i know .
