i was able to trace this photograph back to you .
emily will do anything for david ,
including erasing his debts .
which might prove interesting to your employer .
my father lied .
conrad didn &apos;t hold him captive .
it was a man named malcolm black .
i believe that kate is his operative .
i &apos;m pregnant .
daniel loves you .
but what if i don &apos;t love him anymore ?
your tears suggest otherwise .
please , daniel , come home .
i need you . we need you .
malcolm &apos;s my father .
your cover is blown .
emily ! what happened to you ?
get out of here ! run !
no !
drop it !
you &apos;re gonna be okay , daniel .
you &apos;re still lying to me .
was that ...
that was gunshots .
i want to report that i just heard gunshots at grayson manor .
amanda , what happened ?
victoria , no .
daniel !
no ! daniel !
daniel !
oh , god ! what did you do ? !
he wasn &apos;t supposed to be here .
you hurt ?
hold my hand . don &apos;t let go .
chief . is it true ? shots fired at grayson manor ?
i &apos;m taking two units out there right now .
i &apos;m coming .
isn &apos;t your shift over ?
emily thorne &apos;s a friend . i &apos;m clocking back in .
where &apos;s the ambulance ?
what &apos;s taking so long ?
we called .
i don &apos;t understand . she &apos;s not an fbi agent ?
no , she was a real fbi agent ...
who was also moonlighting for malcolm black .
you were supposed to stay out of this .
and you &apos;re missing the point .
she wasn &apos;t just working for him . she was his daughter .
and she knew who you were ?
i don &apos;t know how , but she did .
she wanted the money that you took .
she was coming for you next .
&quot; expected to hear from you . where are you ?
check in now , or i get involved . &quot;
you have no idea what you &apos;ve just done .
what i &apos;ve done ?
she -- she tried to kill me .
oh , she did kill you .
she killed all of us . you just don &apos;t know it yet .
you know what this man &apos;s capable of ?
years ago , his nephew was in a car accident .
he was crippled .
a week later , the drunk driver disappeared ,
along with his wife , his parents ,
his children , and his brother .
their bodies were found in a hunting shack .
they &apos;d been tortured for six weeks .
if he finds out that you killed his daughter --
it was me .
it doesn &apos;t matter . he &apos;ll bury us all .
then we have to make sure he doesn &apos;t find out .
daniel , i hope you haven &apos;t had dessert , because i &apos;m just ab ...
oh , simone . pardon , i thought you were ...
no . no . why would the news desk call ?
wait .
wait , what did they say ?
are you okay to continue , miss thorne ? you seem ...
no , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m okay .
so , you were home from the party maybe an hour
when mr. grayson started knocking on your door ?
uh , he was pounding on it . yelling .
what was he yelling ?
to let him in ,
that i ruined his life .
he was , uh ...
he was really angry ...
drunk , maybe .
i asked him to leave , but he refused .
which is when you called officer porter ,
asked him to come over ?
i was scared .
but i didn &apos;t make it here in time .
first responders are gonna be here in less than eight minutes .
what are you doing ?
for the story we &apos;re gonna tell , this needs to look right .
we got to move this glass .
daniel smashed that planter through the window .
and you tried to escape ?
upstairs .
but he followed me . we struggled .
and he pushed me . i @-@ i @-@ i ...
fell off the balcony .
when i saw him coming down the stairs ,
i knew it wasn &apos;t over .
that &apos;s when you went for the gun ?
tell me again where you got it .
it must have belonged to a previous owner .
i @-@ i found it when i was , uh ... was moving
some stuff into the attic .
oh , you mean the basement .
earlier , you said you found the gun
when you moved stuff into the basement .
right . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s hard to talk . um ...
i meant i was moving stuff from the basement
into the attic when i found it .
it was under a floorboard .
right .
you &apos;re not gonna find floorboards in a basement ,
are you , officer porter ?
no , you &apos;re sure not .
so , attic it is .
i &apos;m sorry . she &apos;s resting right now .
if it &apos;s all the same with you , i &apos;d rather wait .
if it &apos;s all the same with you ,
victoria &apos;s in no condition to talk to anyone right now .
she just found out ...
oh , i appreciate that ,
but there are questions about the circumstances
of mr. grayson &apos;s death .
he was seen with her tonight in manhattan .
he left abruptly , and we ...
you want to ask her about his state of mind ,
why he might attack his ex @-@ wife ?
do you really think this is a good time
to have that conversation with a grieving mother ?
you &apos;re right . this can wait . i &apos;m sorry to intrude .
oh , is that your van parked outside ?
yeah . this is my house . why ?
you left the keys in the rear door .
oh . well , safe neighborhood .
doesn &apos;t seem like it lately .
how smoothly you lie .
i did that so that you didn &apos;t have to .
i wouldn &apos;t have .
victoria ...
i can &apos;t imagine how painful this is .
no , you can &apos;t .
tell me why .
what crimes did daniel commit
that he not only paid with his life
but that you expect me to tell
the most vile , despicable lies about him ?
you don &apos;t have to say anything to anyone .
all right ? the story will be told ...
the truth is that my son gave his life for your daughter &apos;s .
now he &apos;s gone .
and i will die before i desecrate his name like that .
what kind of monster would make me ?
if we don &apos;t pull this off , malcolm black is coming here .
he will make you , charlotte ,
and everyone else you and i care about
suffer more than you know .
you know so much about him , and yet here we are .
go to hell ...
since we &apos;re choosing to send my son there .
all you had was over @-@ the @-@ counter stuff ,
but the emts can get you something stronger if you ask .
no , i don &apos;t need anything .
right . why would you ?
maybe you can ask for me .
daniel .
i can &apos;t believe it .
are you gonna be all right , jack ?
i &apos;m not the one who went over the railing
and dislocated my shoulder and god knows what else .
no , i meant ...
kate .
i know . i know .
i &apos;m just not letting myself think about it till
we &apos;re through the woods on this , and you should ...
probably do the same .
meaning what ?
meaning you were struggling out there with that detective .
what ?
i &apos;m answering the questions . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m selling the story .
i &apos;m not so sure .
i &apos;m watching her react to you , and i &apos;m telling you ,
if they get a hint that we &apos;re not being truthful , it &apos;s ...
look , the point is ,
considering what you &apos;ve been through ,
it &apos;s okay to tell them that you need a break .
except that i don &apos;t .
i just wanted to let you know
the detectives are done with you for now .
well , they don &apos;t have to be .
i mean , i can keep going if it will help .
no . detective adams says any more tonight
will be diminishing returns .
so as long as you make yourself available tomorrow ,
if need be ...
so , they &apos;re not booking her ?
no . not tonight .
i &apos;m truly sorry , emily .
thank you .
that &apos;s a tough card to draw ...
having to shoot your ex point @-@ blank .
so , you saw the whole thing ?
yeah .
i got here just as ...
just right at the end .
i wish that i had been quicker .
maybe i could have done something .
yeah , well , it sounds like emily didn &apos;t have much choice ,
if what she &apos;s saying is true .
if what she &apos;s saying is true ?
come on . between you and me ,
she was a little shaky with her facts in there .
you try getting the crap
kicked out of you and having to off your ex .
we &apos;ll see how shaky you are .
no , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s just ... i &apos;ve seen emily play people , including me .
she &apos;s good at it .
anyway ...
i hope it &apos;s all true .
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
第四季第十一集
she still sleeping ?
yeah , she needs it .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s up to another police interrogation today .
well , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s abject fear ,
but i &apos;ve been crazy productive .
i reverse time @-@ stamped a call from emily &apos;s phone
to yours last night to support her story .
good .
&apos;cause i know one cop who &apos;s gonna be looking into it .
well , anyone searching for agent taylor will begin in miami .
i sent our , uh , dread pirate malcolm texts from her phone
and dropped a trail of digital breadcrumbs
indicating a long @-@ awaited last @-@ minute vacation .
that phone &apos;s gonna be a problem , man .
it ... it &apos;s got gps .
if malcolm tracks it , we &apos;re all ...
dude , who are you talking to ?
the phone arrived in the sunshine state
by private courier late last night
after i &apos;d excavated it , cloned it ,
and mined every piece of data from it i could .
anything good ?
well , i don &apos;t know .
how about the faa locator numbers
for every one of malcolm black &apos;s private planes ?
one of them just popped up on the faa map .
it &apos;s being prepped - outside an airfield in qttawa .
there &apos;s no flight plan .
it could be headed to miami .
or it could be coming here .
jack , be a &quot; glass half full &quot; guy .
we still have to clean out the hotel room .
i &apos;ll meet you there in 10 .
okay .
louise .
did you hear about daniel grayson ?
i did . i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i know you two were ... colleagues ?
i suddenly felt so alone , and i didn &apos;t know where else to go .
look , i @-@ i @-@ i know it &apos;s a lot to ask , but ,
could i maybe stay here until i get my bearings ?
of course you can , as long as you need .
my casa is your casa .
i @-@ i have to run out for a minute , but i &apos;ll--
was it really your friend emily ?
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know . they &apos;re still investigating .
oh , poor victoria . she must be a wreck .
undoubtedly . we &apos;ll talk soon ?
yeah , i think i &apos;ll bake something for her
before my xanax wears off .
can i use your kitchen ?
thank you .
i need to go out .
the body &apos;s still in the van , and i need to ...
who was that on the phone ?
charlotte &apos;s doctor .
he &apos;s gonna make sure that she doesn &apos;t come home .
i mean , he thinks it &apos;ll damage her recovery .
because that &apos;s what you told him to think .
i &apos;m just looking out for her .
her brother is dead .
what do you think it &apos;s going to do to her
when she hears all these lies about him ?
we don &apos;t have a choice right now .
i do . i &apos;m getting out of here .
i can &apos;t look at you for another second ,
and if i stay in this house , i am going to lose my mind .
where are you going ?
anywhere but here !
what do you think is gonna happen
when the first person asks you about daniel ?
the storm comes in .
none of us survive till sunset .
i won &apos;t be a prisoner to your lies anymore .
i was a prisoner for two decades because of yours .
you can hold on one more day .
were you this cruel 20 years ago and i just missed it ?
back then , you betrayed me to keep daniel alive .
are you really gonna do it again now to protect his memory ?
it &apos;s your call .
i won &apos;t be responsible for anyone &apos;s death , but
i am going to mourn my son .
and i won &apos;t stay here .
victoria &apos;s gonna stay here for now .
are you out of your mind ?
this isn &apos;t my doing .
no . this is happening .
what part of &quot; no &quot; don &apos;t you understand ?
this is my house ,
david , listen to your daughter .
not yours or hers .
in trying to prevent one disaster ,
after everything if she stays another ...
you &apos;re sowing the seeds
second
for an even crueler one .
there is no chance ...
enough ! the both of you !
if we have any hope of getting through this alive ,
this is our only chance . you want to be alone ?
this is a big , safe house to be alone in ...
with someone who can watch you .
why don &apos;t you watch her ?
because i have a body to move .
i have to clean up your mess .
my mess ? ! are you kidding me ? !
why in the hell would ...
cause i said so , that &apos;s why !
i was very clear with you .
i said stay out of this malcolm black business ,
but you didn &apos;t .
now you &apos;re gonna listen .
i can &apos;t watch victoria , and i can &apos;t have her being alone .
this house is a fortress .
there &apos;s plenty of room for the two of you .
so for the time being , you &apos;re both gonna stay here .
do you understand ?
good . play nice .
i got into the reservation
database and checked kate out as of last night ,
but froze the room .
i &apos;m gonna go check out the security monitors .
you start packing . card key for her room .
yeah , i already have one .
yeah , yours is gonna leave a record of access .
this one &apos;s clean .
go .
margaux .
i went to the beach house . it was empty .
why are you here ?
it was decided i couldn &apos;t be alone .
and emily ? is she here ?
somewhere upstairs .
i &apos;m so ...
drop it !
jack .
jack .
are you okay ?
look , she was bad news .
she was going to kill emily .
you didn &apos;t have any choice .
when i took this job , in the back of my mind ,
i always knew that there was a chance i &apos;d have to ...
she just wasn &apos;t the person that i thought ...
i get it .
i will doing anything i can to help .
but right now ,
we have 12 minutes till the cleaning woman comes .
we got to get packing now .
what i heard from the police makes no sense .
she &apos;s claiming he attacked her ?
she had to shoot him ? self @-@ defense ?
what happened
has been hard for all of us to accept .
but i don &apos;t accept it , and you can &apos;t , either .
the police must hear the truth from us .
when i last spoke with daniel , he was happy ,
committed to turning his life around , to spending it with me ,
to being a family .
he did love you , margaux .
that &apos;s how i know she &apos;s lying .
daniel had moved on from emily .
he had no reason to come to her house .
she lured him here , then killed him in cold blood .
you of all people should know that .
but i don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t know that .
how can you say that ?
because i know the truth .
daniel and emily could never escape one another .
and what she inflicted upon him
was something he could never forget ,
and i will always hate her for it .
but it &apos;s why i also believe her .
then i &apos;ll go to the police without you .
you &apos;re welcome .
emily .
what are you doing here ?
they said they had more questions .
you didn &apos;t have to come by .
i talked to ben and adams and i got you a day to recover .
i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s you intervening that will make me look suspicious .
you &apos;re wrong ... everyone here understands what you went through .
no one &apos;s gonna think twice about giving you more time
unless you give them reason to .
look , this is not your call to make .
yes , it is .
i have every bit as much to lose as you .
i was there last night , too , and i saw what happened afterward .
it was a couple of answers . no one even noticed .
ben noticed .
well , if that &apos;s true ,
all the more reason to show up and fix it .
or blow it for all of us .
look , my alibi will hold .
i &apos;ve done this a million times . i know what i &apos;m doing .
yes ,
you &apos;ve done this a million times , but you are only human .
and you are struggling this time ,
because what happened last night is traumatic
and it is going to have an effect .
take the day off .
get your head together . grieve .
it &apos;s what humans do .
look , jack , just worry about yourself .
my head is just fine .
this license is still temporary .
yeah , i haven &apos;t really had a chance to update my paperwork ,
but i will get on that .
so , if we &apos;re done ...
you seem to be in a hurry .
didn &apos;t even ask why i stopped you .
your taillight &apos;s out .
really ? i don &apos;t think so .
let &apos;s take a look .
oh , yeah .
look at that .
it &apos;s almost like someone intentionally smashed it .
open the back of the van .
i don &apos;t think so .
you don &apos;t have cause .
my cause if that you &apos;re a sketchy son of a bitch .
you may have fooled a lot of people ,
but i know you &apos;re hiding something .
open it .
this isn &apos;t about me , is it ?
it &apos;s about victoria grayson .
i &apos;m just the guy standing in between you
and a woman who won &apos;t give you the time of day .
am i right ?
open it , or i will .
get that taillight fixed .
i was taught to deflect grief
with baked goods and comfort food ,
thus the abundance of starches .
thank you , louise . that &apos;s very thoughtful .
i know my relationship with your son was ...
brief , but in that time ,
it was clear that danny had a spirit of compassion ,
decency , and goodness .
like his mother .
i appreciate that .
i am so sorry for your loss .
well , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re exhausted ,
and i left nolan ross &apos; kitchen a complete mess ,
so i should go .
you &apos;re friends with mr. ross ?
yes , i @-@ i &apos;m actually staying with him .
louise , i hate to impose , bu ...
but do you think maybe you could sit with me for a bit ?
yes .
yes , of course . i &apos;m here for you .
anything you need .
talk to me .
guess whose plane just took off .
nolan , dear , victoria appreciated the pie so much
that now i &apos;m thinking cupcakes .
do you mind ?
it &apos;s all yours .
where &apos;s he headed ?
south . he &apos;s headed south .
it &apos;s all south from canada .
is he aiming at the hamptons
or chasing his daughter &apos;s phone to miami ?
david , we &apos;re not gonna know for a few hours .
you just ... have to hang tight .
i &apos;m learning that &apos;s not my strength .
detective adams is still out in the field .
she &apos;ll join us as soon as she gets back ,
but if you &apos;re sure that you &apos;re okay ...
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;m sure .
i know there was a discrepancy last night with the , uh --
oh , where you first found the gun ?
yeah .
discrepancies happen .
it &apos;s not really a concern .
but the medical examiner &apos;s report ...
i mean , that could be a problem .
see , last night ,
you said you thought daniel had been drinking when he showed up .
i did . yeah .
but the m.e. &apos; s report shows no alcohol in his system .
all right , so , that &apos;s weird .
i mean , we can run it again . maybe he missed it .
more likely i was wrong and misjudged him .
i mean ,
daniel didn &apos;t need alcohol to get violent and angry with me .
i was actually just talking to daniel &apos;s girlfriend about that .
margaux lemarchal ?
she swore up and down that daniel wasn &apos;t angry
or violent or anything .
you know , in fact , according to her ,
he was as happy as she &apos;d ever seen him .
he was excited that he was gonna be a father .
i &apos;m sorry , did you just say ...
a father ?
yeah , you didn &apos;t ... know ?
i &apos;m sorry . i think i &apos;m gonna need a break .
oh , of course .
uh , would you mind if i asked you just one more question ?
what ?
daniel attacked you , right ?
but he had no bruises , no cuts .
i mean , he had ... he had no defensive wounds of any sort .
tell me why i shouldn &apos;t find that curious .
especially since you &apos;ve always struck me
as someone who could hold her own in a fight .
he &apos;s baiting you , emily . get out of there .
daniel was unhurt because ...
i didn &apos;t want to hurt daniel .
even when he attacked me , i held back .
why ?
because what he was saying was true .
i had hurt him .
i married him for - the wrong reasons , and when ...
when it all fell apart ,
it was like i threw a grenade into his life .
the damage that i caused was real ,
and i knew it at the time .
i wouldn &apos;t hurt him because ...
underneath all of the scar tissue and ...
the flaws , the temper ...
there was a genuinely good guy
just trying to find his way .
so , despite our history ,
despite everything that i told myself ...
i cared about him .
but you still shot him .
only when i knew i didn &apos;t have a choice .
only when i knew he intended to kill me .
why would you think that ?
because he tried it before ...
the night of our wedding .
on the boat .
i &apos;d heard about that , but i @-@ i always thought that he ...
i covered for him .
it was the night that he learned i wasn &apos;t in love with him .
it almost destroyed daniel , so ...
he almost destroyed me .
daniel said that was the night that i ruined his life .
turns out he was wrong .
his airplane just entered new york airspace ,
so he &apos;s either gonna hang a louie at long island
or he &apos;s gonna keep heading south .
any minute now .
how &apos;s she doing ?
ask her .
i &apos;m asking you .
how do you think she &apos;s doing ? she lost her son .
i am sorry about daniel .
i know .
that &apos;s it , folks .
his plane just passed over new york .
someone is headed for disney world .
that &apos;s a relief .
okay , so we bought ourselves some time .
but what now ?
when malcolm doesn &apos;t find what he &apos;s looking for ,
i can guarantee miami &apos;s not gonna be his last stop .
you see , i &apos;m hoping that &apos;s exactly what it is .
what did you do ?
well , you don &apos;t get to be malcolm black
without having some enemies ... competitive dealers ,
cartel leaders ... all equally blood @-@ thirsty .
mm . made some calls , did you ?
i suggested they visit miami ...
where , when , the whole itinerary .
oh , you are one bad @-@ ass travel agent , mr. clarke .
margaux .
i &apos;m so sorry about daniel .
i can &apos;t imagine what you &apos;re going through .
please , come . sit .
no .
i won &apos;t be here that long .
my attorney just spoke with the police .
apparently ,
they will not be naming you as a suspect in daniel &apos;s murder .
did you know ? self @-@ defense .
they &apos;re going to make that official .
margaux ...
no . you need to listen .
i know you &apos;re lying .
you played a game with the police , with victoria ,
with who knows how many others ,
but believe me when i tell you ,
i ... do not play .
i know you murdered daniel .
i did not . and i am just as devastated ...
stop talking and hear me !
i &apos;m going to make it my life &apos;s journey
to see you pay for what you &apos;ve done ,
and that journey begins now !
we bury daniel on friday .
you will not be there .
you can &apos;t do that , margaux .
no . but she can .
i see .
thank you for your hospitality .
i &apos;ll be going home now .
you know that daniel would have wanted me at his funeral .
maybe .
but we &apos;ll never know , will we ?
what do you think ?
yes . it &apos;s perfect .
but ...
but the , uh ...
the tie ? it &apos;s the tie , right ?
no , the ... the tie is fine .
but the knot ... it &apos;s a little --
it &apos;s a little lumpy , right ?
i don &apos;t know . i tried three times .
let me .
ugh , tell me this ...
what kind of grown man still needs help with a tie ?
a man who i think can do it with his eyes closed
but still wants his mother to feel worthwhile .
pay attention .
soon you &apos;re going to be teaching your own son how to do it .
done .
let &apos;s see .
amanda .
we &apos;re just on the way to the cemetery .
i thought i &apos;d check in on you .
you okay ?
sure .
where &apos;s your lady friend ?
she &apos;s waiting in the limo .
just tell me this .
a few nights ago , before the wheels came off ,
you said that this would all be over soon ,
that it was all part of a larger plan .
what did you mean ?
i can &apos;t -- i &apos;m not doing this right now .
please . i need to know .
what was the plan ?
if all this hadn &apos;t happened ,
we &apos;d be having her funeral right now instead of daniel &apos;s .
you were gonna kill victoria ?
and now ?
i &apos;m gonna be late .
adams told me that you were a real asset
on the , uh , daniel grayson shooting
and i &apos;m a fool if i don &apos;t think about making you a detective .
well , i &apos;d never call you a fool , sir .
yeah . find me tomorrow . we &apos;ll chat .
well , i can chat now .
i can &apos;t do it .
thanks to your partner ,
i got , uh , paperwork that &apos;s gonna keep me here past dinner .
my partner ?
last @-@ minute furlough changes ,
he wants personal days ...
you guys don &apos;t talk ?
hey . what &apos;s this about you taking some personal days ?
you never said anything .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re called &quot; personal . &quot;
it &apos;s just a couple days at home .
i &apos;m ...
i haven &apos;t been 100 % lately . i &apos;m not sleeping .
it &apos;s that girl , isn &apos;t it ? the fed ?
i was wondering why i hadn &apos;t seen her around .
yeah . she , uh ... she left after that party the other night .
guess she &apos;d had enough of this place .
well , i &apos;m sorry .
and if it &apos;s any consolation ,
my old man used to say never get involved with a woman
who owns more handcuffs than you . so ...
yeah . yeah , that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s advice .
she really did a number on you , didn &apos;t she ?
yeah .
yeah , i think she did .
the lord is my shepherd . i shall not want .
he maketh me to lie down in green pastures .
he leadeth me beside the still waters .
he restoreth my soul .
he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name &apos;s sake .
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death ,
i shall fear no evil , for thou art with me .
thy rod and thy staff , they comfort me .
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies .
thou anointest my head with oil .
my cup runneth over .
oh , my god !
i &apos;m daniel .
i &apos;m emily .
will you marry me ?
yes .
no , don &apos;t ... don &apos;t ... don &apos;t do it .
sorry , pal . daylight &apos;s wasting .
oh , come on .
waking up with you - is the best part of my day .
if you open those curtains , it &apos;s all over .
