第七季 第十一集
six years ago , you got a message from will gardner ,
on your voice mail , and i erased it .
you were about to go on stage
and stand beside peter for his s.a. run ,
and i didn &apos;t want to hurt that .
i listened to the voice mail .
will said he loved you
and would give up everything to be with you .
and i erased it .
i don &apos;t want to stand in the way of your happiness again .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m sorry .
get out .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s bothered me for the last six ...
eli .
i need you not to talk .
okay .
get out of my house .
i &apos;m afraid if i don &apos;t explain ...
do @-@ do you want me to ...
alicia , i &apos;ll be on the bus , so i think we should ...
‭ i think ...
alicia , you in there ?
alicia ?
you having a party ?
no .
just ... came from the shower .
anyway , i was just , um ...
heading out , and there was one more thing .
uh , prenup , the one hour capped .
uh , your husband wanted me look into
howard lyman &apos;s finances .
oh , right .
jackie &apos;s prenup .
seems like your potential stepfather @-@ in @-@ law
secreted away $ 2.2 million .
it was sheltered in relic holdings ,
a delaware corporation .
okay , thanks .
are ... are you all right ?
yes .
you look ... distracted .
no , just ... packing .
you know , trying to get out the door .
right , uh ...
iowa . the caucus .
good luck .
thanks .
okay , um ...
i &apos;ll see you .
yes . good .
wait , wait , wait ! this is not a democracy .
i &apos;ll decide which way we &apos;re gonna be ...
in consultation with the candidate ...
yes , eli , thank you , in consultation with peter .
i &apos;ve run five campaigns in iowa ,
and this is the first time
we have the &quot; full grassley &quot; in sight .
the &quot; full grassley &quot; doesn &apos;t mean anything .
yeah , when we were all driving studebakers ...
i &apos;ve already decided .
i don &apos;t need to hear from you .
but there &apos;s this thing called the internet now .
it &apos;s this marvelous device . you should take a look at it .
yes , and the internet still doesn &apos;t have
the reach of the nightly news .
whatcha reading ?
jane eyre .
why ?
i want to .
mom , are you okay ?
i am great .
i don &apos;t know how people live out here .
there &apos;s nothing to do .
you &apos;re on a bus with an xbox .
yeah , but they don &apos;t have xboxes .
how do you know that ?
this isn &apos;t amish country .
that &apos;s not the point .
the point is that ... well , look out there .
i mean , what is this ? cornfield county ?
there &apos;s nothing out there .
relax . just enjoy it .
getting carsick ?
nope .
because when you read , you get carsick .
i &apos;m not now .
peter !
can you help us decide ?
are you all still arguing ?
we &apos;re coming to the fork ,
mr. governor , in ten miles .
we either head east toward des moines--
which is the smart choice--
or continue north toward rock valley , as we agreed .
ruth says that the &quot; full grassley &quot;
will give us the lead story on the nightly news .
yeah , nightly news coverage worked
when kennedy was running , so ...
peter , we built this campaign
using sophisticated voter targeting
based on computer models and micro @-@ advertising ...
alicia , have you got a minute ?
candidates have proven that completing the &quot; full grassley &quot;
translates to huge support .
rick santorum did it , and went from dead in the water
to coming within eight votes of winning the state .
and by the spring , he &apos;d dropped out of the race .
well , i know that covering three counties
before 5 : 00 p.m. is difficult , but we also have to ...
alicia .
we have to hit three counties
to complete &quot; the full grassley . &quot;
do you know what that is ?
it &apos;s named after senator chuck grassley .
a candidate visits all 99 counties
in iowa in a campaign cycle .
it shows the candidate cares for the state ...
it shows the candidate &apos;s desperate .
we stop for 15 minutes ,
peter eats some local delicacy ,
like a loose meat sandwich ...
what &apos;s a loose meat sandwich ?
a sandwich with loose meat .
just one second .
all right , here is our dilemma :
hitting three counties before 5 : 00 p.m.
is going to be extremely difficult ? do we risk it ?
what does ruth want ?
the &quot; full grassley . &quot;
then i &apos;d do that .
alicia .
hi , it &apos;s lucca .
i &apos;m about to go into the prenup .
i just wanted to know how contentious
we &apos;re willing to let this get .
well , i guess you should just
let jackie and howard take the lead .
well , they &apos;re like love birds right now .
so go easy .
but your husband seemed to want to push this .
uh @-@ oh , i better get in there .
okay . good luck .
this is a pro @-@ forma prenup ;
i see no reason to belabor it .
neither do i.
a pen . my kingdom for a pen !
before we sign , we need to talk about relic holdings .
relic what ?
sounds like a rash i once had .
you &apos;ve never heard of it ?
no . why ?
relic holdings was incorporated last year ,
in delaware , under your name .
it &apos;s a shell corporation , a paper entity
used to conceal $ 2.2 million .
howard , are you trying to hide money from me ?
no . really ?
i have no idea what this is about .
we &apos;re going to need a recess .
we have a problem .
yes , david , we &apos;re in a meeting with someone right now .
no , it can &apos;t wait .
this is ms. creech ...
nice to meet you .
it &apos;s very important .
... from the illinois fair employment practices agency .
why , hello , ms. screech .
creech .
creech .
it &apos;s always good to have someone like you drop by .
i &apos;m investigating your firm
for discriminatory hiring practices .
i was just telling ms. creech
that we recently hired an exceptionally diverse group of associates .
unfortunately , we received a complaint .
from whom ?
that &apos;s confidential ,
as i &apos;m sure you understand .
this has canning &apos;s fingerprints all over it .
no , i don &apos;t think so .
he &apos;s in full take @-@ down mode .
it &apos;s retribution for the dipple case .
no , fepa doesn &apos;t work that fast .
we have another problem , too .
do you remember the depietro settlement ? $ 2.2 million ?
david , can we focus like we ...
i hid the money in a shell corporation
so alicia wouldn &apos;t get her hands on it
when she was trying to screw us over her exit package .
and we &apos;re ...
what ?
seriously ? what ?
you committed fraud .
no . i committed ... selective depositing .
oh , dear god .
just take care of it .
so this was a good idea .
good rally , ruth .
shut up .
do you have any advance at all ?
yes , but we &apos;re stretched thin .
let &apos;s do it .
it &apos;s not about the crowds , governor .
you &apos;ll never beat hillary and bernie &apos;s crowds .
apparently not .
peter florrick for president !
peter is the man !
is that the advance ?
no .
mr. florrick-- sorry , governor florrick--
and soon to be president florrick--
i am a florrick fanatic .
i am an honest @-@ to @-@ god , number one florrick fanatic .
neil howard sloan @-@ jacob .
uh , thank you , mister ...
sloan @-@ jacob .
you don &apos;t remember me , do you ?
well , i remember you .
peter &apos;s gonna be an amazing president
he &apos;ll make the country great for every resident
it &apos;s evident he &apos;s relevant to our government !
you want to do a selfie ?
where &apos;s your advance team , ruth ?
stop poisoning peter .
it &apos;s not about the crowds , it &apos;s about how it &apos;s reported .
and who will report it ?
any reporter worth his salt is gonna photograph
how empty this all is .
well , that &apos;s why i got a reporter
who isn &apos;t worth his salt .
democratic presidential candidate peter florrick
伊利诺伊州州长彼得 · 福瑞克来访爱荷华州
is on pace to complete &quot; the full monty , &quot;
a feat only attempted by the bravest politicians :
visiting all of the 70 ... 89 iowa counties
by 5 : 00 pm cutoff .
and here to tell the tale
is none other than the candidate himself , peter florrick .
good to see you , ted .
and good to see you , too .
and it looks like your fans are out in force today .
we love you , peter !
they sure seem to love you .
nice costume .
thanks , i &apos;m a florrick fanatic .
uh , three more counties to go , ted .
just three more counties .
and you have four and a half hours to go .
伊利诺伊州州长彼得 · 福瑞克来访爱荷华州
we can do it . who can do it ?
we can do it !
who can do it ?
we can do it !
don &apos;t worry .
peter will be happy
when you surround him with cheering people .
i hope this campaign isn &apos;t over tomorrow .
i &apos;d really like to get to know you , alicia .
why ?
you &apos;re ...
interesting .
you don &apos;t let things confuse you .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s true .
i used to think i knew what life was about ,
but i don &apos;t have a clue .
cherish that moment .
when you realize you don &apos;t know what life &apos;s about .
that &apos;s truth .
you think you could ever be happy ?
if you had taken a ... left instead of a right
or went up instead of down , you would &apos;ve been happy ?
no .
really ?
you can &apos;t control fate .
it &apos;s in your genes .
can &apos;t change that .
so whatever i do , whatever i did ...
i &apos;d end up right back here ?
well , maybe not here , but someplace like here .
at the end of every fork , there &apos;s a cliff .
go ahead , take &quot; the road less traveled . &quot;
you &apos;ll still find that cliff .
i think if i could go back to georgetown right now ...
... back to criminal law 101,
seat 35l--
that was my seat--
i would &apos;ve said yes .
yes to what ?
there was a young man ...
in love with me .
um , why don &apos;t we go on the bus , alicia ?
no , i &apos;m good .
did you file a discriminatory hiring claim with fepa ?
excuse me ?
did you file a discriminatory hiring claim with fepa ?
you know you can &apos;t ask me that .
you did , didn &apos;t you ?
i didn &apos;t file it with fepa ,
i filed it with the eeoc . but i withdrew it .
as soon as i started working here , i withdrew the complaint .
unfortunately , illinois has a work @-@ share agreement
with the feds .
well , then i &apos;ll just withdraw the complaint .
you can &apos;t-- not once they start investigating .
they started ?
yes , the rep is in our conference room right now .
that &apos;s too bad , isn &apos;t it ?
is that sarcasm ? because we hired you .
yes .
after you didn &apos;t .
monica ...
this is serious .
i need you to drive faster .
we have to get to merrill by 2 : 00 .
so tell us about &quot; the full monty , &quot; mr. gold .
the full grassley .
the full ... i don &apos;t understand .
uh , grassley , i think that &apos;s what you mean .
&quot; monty &quot; means taking off your clothes .
we certainly don &apos;t want any of that here ,
do we , sir ?
could you just give me a second ?
alicia , give me five minutes .
you don &apos;t need to talk .
just listen to me for five minutes .
it &apos;s a nightmare just watching you like this .
you know what the nightmare is ?
being here , when i want to be home .
being on a bus in the middle of iowa .
that &apos;s the nightmare .
now leave me alone .
it was a clerical error , howard .
i &apos;m sorry if it caused you and jackie strife .
well , maybe it wasn &apos;t a clerical error .
maybe the money really is mine .
no , it was a mistake .
but for tax reasons , it &apos;s a little difficult to unravel .
so what i &apos;d like you to do is just play along ,
admit the money is yours .
and we will make it worth your while .
what , um , what does that mean , &quot; worth my while &quot; ?
it means i &apos;ll be appreciative .
no . no , no , no .
how much ?
$ 10,000 .
half of it .
what ?
are you kidding ?
it &apos;s all in my name , all 2.2 million .
i don &apos;t see why i shouldn &apos;t keep all of it .
governor florrick is on pace
决心完成格拉斯利壮举
to complete the full grassley .
it &apos;s a bold move and one ...
&quot; bold move . &quot; that &apos;s what we want .
no one &apos;s counting the crowd in rock valley .
matthews is an outlier . no one else is talking about it .
backroom is .
backroom ...
talks about trump sneezing if it gets them more clicks .
携手改变我们的国家
here we go . merrill .
what delicacy do we eat here ?
loose meat sandwiches .
again ?
don &apos;t let anyone hear you say that .
iowans have no sense of humor
about their loose meat sandwiches .
well , at least there &apos;s more people here .
yeah . press is doing their job .
governor ! alicia ! kids , let &apos;s go .
we have to hurry . ten minutes here , eat a sandwich ,
back on the bus , or we &apos;ll never make it to anthon ! let &apos;s go !
peter florrick for president !
peter florrick for president !
peter ! peter florrick for president ! peter ...
共同改变我们的国家
would anyone mind telling me what the hell is going on
in plymouth county ?
we didn &apos;t spend on the media budget .
and that makes them angry ?
you guys should probably check out glare .
you know what the nightmare is ?
being here when i want to be home . being on a bus
然而他的妻子艾丽西娅 · 福瑞克却在抱怨 ...
in the middle of iowa . that &apos;s the nightmare .
what the ... ? how did ... ?
now leave me alone .
you &apos;re not here to record private conversations .
you &apos;re here to record the news .
yes , sorry .
that wasn &apos;t me . that was my producer .
yeah , but you recorded it .
not intentionally .
please don &apos;t be mad at me .
what do you want me to do ?
i need you to apologize for the &quot; nightmare &quot; comment .
okay .
say it was only a nightmare to be here because you were
concerned for your children . grace has a cold ,
and you wanted to be home with her .
does grace have a cold ?
sniffles . all the media attention
is hard on a mother who &apos;s protective of her children .
can you say that ?
yes .
i &apos;ll get ted to interview you .
we need to get this out there before we hit the last county .
still thinking about first love ?
sit back down .
i was in love .
a long time ago .
he was a pollster . i was a lowly volunteer .
i won &apos;t tell you what campaign , &apos; cause it &apos;ll date me .
he wanted children ; i didn &apos;t . so that was it .
i remember the last time i saw him .
everything about it .
it was the middle of a sidewalk .
the light just turned yellow ,
and i had to go one way and he had to go the other .
and it was the best kiss of my life .
the absolute best .
for a long time , i wondered
how my life would &apos;ve changed if i &apos;d said yes to him .
until i saw last year he was sent to prison for mail fraud .
that looked like it was gonna go somewhere .
whatever you think you could &apos;ve changed in your life
or in his , you couldn &apos;t have .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s true .
it is true .
you know why ?
i just told you .
mrs. florrick ,
女儿生病 言论为 「 断章取义 」
how are you ?
good , ted . it &apos;s a beautiful day in iowa .
and we are sampling all the great food
in each town as we pass through .
and i guess that you feel that some remarks that we reported were ...
misreported on you .
yes . when i was caught
saying it was a nightmare to be here .
what i actually meant was it was a nightmare to be away
from my kitchen , when one of my kids has a cold .
i was hoping to take care of my kids .
i &apos;m sure every mom can relate .
i &apos;m so sorry , my dear , but i wasn &apos;t trying
to hide anything from you . it &apos;s just that i simply forgot .
$ 2.2 million ?
it happens all the time . just last week ...
we &apos;re going to need a full accounting .
times , dates , all the specifics .
be my guest . but i am innocent of everything ,
except being old .
last night , i left the fridge door open .
everything melted ,
including that marzipan you gave me .
that &apos;s unfortunate ,
but we &apos;re still going to need documentation .
excuse us for a moment .
would you ?
you &apos;re buying this ?
when you get to my age ,
you see this happen .
and it only gets worse , which is
why this preup will need to account for more than just finances .
what do you have in mind ?
if i &apos;m going to be taking care of howard ,
i &apos;ll need full power of attorney .
do you think she &apos;s selling us out ?
no .
how &apos;d it go ?
she saw the interview video i posted online .
i thought you took that down .
i did .
but i might have included a link to it
in my eeoc complaint .
of course .
she thinks you hired me
just so i &apos;d withdraw the complaint .
i kept telling her that &apos;s not true ,
but ... she wants to talk to both of you .
* let &apos;s sing to grand old ioway *
are you ready for peter florrick ?
are you ready for the man himself ?
* peter &apos;s smarter ... *
the important thing is we did it--
the full grassley with five minutes to spare .
* ... i &apos;m right , peter &apos;s gonna win come election night ! *
so now , you get off ,
you shake a few hands , eat a last loose meat sandwich--
oh , please , please , not another one .
five minutes of the stump ,
and we &apos;re back on the bus for des moines .
is this really gonna matter ?
we do what we can .
the good lord does the rest .
* peter &apos;s smarter than einstein *
* he &apos;s got brains like l.a. &apos; s got sunshine *
* i need to hear you now , tell me that i &apos;m right *
* peter &apos;s gonna win come election night *
* i never hesitate to talk about my peter *
* there are other names , but peter &apos;s gonna beat &apos; em *
* peter &apos;s gonna win come election night *
* peter &apos;s gonna win come election night ... *
it sounds like a party &apos;s going on there .
yes , chris , the mood here is infectious ,
as peter florrick finishes the full grassley
with five minutes to spare .
five minutes ? wow !
we did it .
yeah .
i need a drink .
here &apos;s a highlight from the rally .
* i need to hear you now , tell me that i &apos;m right *
* peter &apos;s gonna win come election night ! *
so , 24 more hours ?
just the caucus tomorrow and all will be revealed .
what &apos;s considered winning ?
for us ?
second place .
and ... losing ?
third place .
can we do it ?
do you want to do it ?
i have no idea .
well , then fasten your seatbelt .
you think today was crazy ?
tomorrow will show you how insane democracy can get .
catch florrick fever ! you &apos;ve got florrick fever !
peter florrick , 2016 !
uh @-@ oh .
chris ,
is governor florrick spitting out his loose meat sandwich ?
so , turning to the next issue : power of attorney .
power of attorney ? in case of incapacitation ?
power of attorney now .
why ?
howard ...
you &apos;re not in the same shape you once were .
i do the jack lalanne thing every morning .
i am ripped .
i mean mentally .
you &apos;re ... declining .
i &apos;m sharper than the serpent &apos;s tooth .
that &apos;s king lear .
and he lost his mind .
it &apos;s from the first act ,
and lear was still completely in charge of his faculties .
and what about the $ 2.2 million you just forgot about ?
people of sound mind don &apos;t just forget about money like that .
but ...
and if you can &apos;t face the reality of your situation ...
i need the room .
david ...
young ethnically ambitious woman ,
i need a moment alone with my intended .
it &apos;s all a sham , baby .
howard ...
i didn &apos;t forget about the money .
i never knew about the money .
the firm was trying to do this thing to hide some cash ,
and i played along , hoping they would cut me in--
uh , cut ... us in .
this has all been very taxing .
we can resume these discussions later .
how &apos;d it go ?
i think the storm is setting in .
he &apos;s not just losing his memory , he &apos;s becoming delusional .
that &apos;s what fepa needs ,
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to give them .
an apology .
we &apos;re too far down the rabbit hole for anything else .
who do you have in mind ?
you .
no way .
you saw the video .
howard lyman was the worst offender .
cary , you blatantly stated that lockhart , agos &amp; lee
doesn &apos;t employ african @-@ americans in every position .
and you made it seem like a badge of honor .
that is not what i meant .
that doesn &apos;t matter .
you need to do it for the firm .
the firm with your name .
hurry ! caucus starts in three minutes .
this is the bellwether precinct .
we need this one to go our way .
but , ruth , how bad was dad &apos;s ... ?
loose meat incident ?
the goodwill we generated with the &quot; full grassley &quot;
might have dissipated .
that just sounds so wrong .
but iowans are savvy voters .
if we lost some votes ,
this is our shot to get them back--
right here on the caucus floor .
oh , wow . i did not expect it to be this crazy .
unlike the gop , democrats don &apos;t do secret ballots .
this is old @-@ style athenian democracy .
a what ?
athenian democracy .
literally , a gathering of neighbors
trying to convince each other to support their candidate .
every candidate has a corner .
okay , that &apos;s hillary &apos;s corner .
hillary ! hillary !
and there &apos;s bernie &apos;s .
there &apos;s no debate . bernie &apos;s great , great , great !
eh , oh , and those are the people for o &apos;malley .
martin o &apos;malley ! martin ! o &apos;malley !
where &apos;s dad &apos;s corner ?
oh , there it is .
oh ... my ... god .
where is everybody ?
there are supposed to be 30 people here .
how do you know there were supposed to be 30 ?
we had promises from people .
well , what do we do now ?
peter can &apos;t be on the floor , but you can .
you &apos;ve got to convince people to vote for him .
how ?
you can &apos;t approach caucus @-@ goers directly .
what ? why not ?
you &apos;re not registered iowa voters .
how do we convince people
to vote for dad if we can &apos;t approach them ?
you get them to come to you .
who are you phoning ?
the cavalry .
how @-@ how do we get them to come to us ?
you &apos;ve been all over the local news .
you make yourself visible ,
people will come to you-- and when they do ,
you talk about how much peter loves iowa
and everything it stands for .
josh , what are you doing ?
poll numbers . how &apos;s it going ?
disaster .
what do you mean ?
there &apos;s no one here . no one for peter .
we need 30 people in 30 minutes
to stand under his sign , or he &apos;s out .
are you kidding me ? where are the local workers ?
where &apos;s the volunteers ?
uh , josh , josh ...
less anger , more action .
where are you going ? i &apos;ll be right here circulating .
just remember the number 29 .
we need 29 supporters in our group when they call the vote
if we want to stay in the game .
now , go ! we have half an hour .
29 people .
yeah .
we can do this !
it &apos;s not about the sandwiches ,
it &apos;s about doing unpleasant things .
yes ...
every other candidate showed up and did it--
just ate those sandwiches , and didn &apos;t go spitting it out ,
and that tells you something .
i @-@ i can just ...
it makes you think ,
maybe he doesn &apos;t have the stomach for the job .
i don &apos;t think he ...
being able to handle what &apos;s being
given to you is a big part of ...
hey . you go ?
uh , next year . i got early acceptance .
congrats . yeah . i &apos;m there , too .
oh . a freshman . yeah , you &apos;re gonna love it .
it &apos;s a great school .
i can tell you &apos;re really smart .
oh , is that right ?
which is why i &apos;m wondering why you &apos;re voting for this guy
and not my dad .
you &apos;re zach florrick ?
your sister is grace , right ?
uh , yeah .
look , my dad accepted jesus christ five years ago ,
and he is trying to bring christian stewardship into his office .
i &apos;m from iowa .
i went to roosevelt high school in des moines ,
and i wouldn &apos;t be here
if i didn &apos;t believe in governor florrick .
look at obama with health care .
that was an unpleasant thing .
but he did it . if hillary ...
edna ,
we appreciate your insights ,
but if you don &apos;t mind , i think we &apos;d all like to hear
what mrs. florrick has to say .
i &apos;m not stopping her .
i could make a laundry list of all the hard things
my husband &apos;s done , but i &apos;ll just say ...
that when he &apos;s faced with any tough decisions ,
my husband always asks himself one question :
will this make a positive impact on people &apos;s lives .
time &apos;s up !
join your preference group for viability call !
... 25 , 26 , 27 ...
28-- ah !
we &apos;re short one .
we just need one person .
just ... one .
someone call someone . come on !
come on , sam .
your candidate doesn &apos;t need you-- we do .
and we got pretty signs .
we have pretty signs .
pretty blue-- just ... come on over here .
i can get you a signed photo .
tell her to come over .
if she doesn &apos;t come for you , she won &apos;t for me .
she likes you .
me ?
hey ! i &apos;m grace .
sam .
hey , come on-- i &apos;ve got an extra sign for you over here .
i have one over here , too . you come here .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t .
but it was really nice meeting you .
we need florrick !
29 . we got it .
we &apos;re viable !
we need florrick ! we need florrick !
we need florrick ! we need florrick !
we need florrick !
hi , jason ? i &apos;m still in the prenup .
do you think you can find anything
on the provenance of howard &apos;s shell company ?
um , i &apos;m having trouble hearing you .
is it my phone or yours ?
i &apos;m in san francisco .
reception can &apos;t get any clearer .
alicia didn &apos;t say anything about you being in california .
is everything all right with you two ?
yeah . i took a job . she knows .
well , if i &apos;d known you were out of state , i wouldn &apos;t have called .
no , i can still take care of it .
multitasking is all the rage out here .
good . well , whatever you can find .
we &apos;re mid @-@ battle , and i think there &apos;s something suspicious .
thanks . bye .
it seems quite clear that lockhart / agos / lee
has in fact fostered a racist culture .
i was afraid you &apos;d say that ,
but ...
frankly , i don &apos;t disagree .
well , your investigation has forced some unstinting self reflection .
things like this ,
things that are so embedded in the corporate culture ,
they ... they don &apos;t happen overnight .
in our case , it was handed down
by a longstanding senior partner named howard lyman ,
you may recall him
from ms. timmons &apos; undercover tape . uh ...
mm . cary , why don &apos;t we discuss this ?
i just want to tell her about her position .
we &apos;ve decided to invite howard to take emeritus status .
this will limit his voting rights
and his contact with the associates .
would that be a satisfactory remedy for your agency ?
yes .
yes , i think it would .
consider it done , then .
you used the fepa complaint
to get what you wanted all along .
no .
i did what needed to be done to save the firm .
25 , 26 , 27 , 28-- you &apos;re one short .
no , we &apos;re not . what happened ?
sorry , ruth , you &apos;re not viable .
wait , we had 29 . what happened ?
it &apos;s the youth minister . she &apos;s gone .
i &apos;m not giving you additional time to find your lost sheep .
come on , carl .
even a youth minister has to powder her nose .
no .
i have worked six caucuses ,
and never once seen a precinct chair reject a request
for a reasonable accommodation on time .
letter of the law , spirit of it , too .
sir , your denial of our request
violates procedural due process .
i may not be a high @-@ priced lawyer , mrs. florrick ,
but i know the rules : no extra time .
mr. peltola ?
pursuant to rule 7b , a precinct chair must certify
all votes cast and the number of voters registered at the precinct .
i know the rules .
if a voter is missing ,
it is incumbent upon you to find out whether or not the voter has ,
in fact , left the premises .
first ruth tells me she &apos;s powdering her nose ,
now you tell me elvis left the building .
no , i checked the ladies &apos; room . she &apos;s not there .
listen up , everybody !
we &apos;re adding five additional minutes
to the vote to locate a voter .
nice job , ladies .
let &apos;s just find that minister .
yeah , jason , what do you got ?
ugh . enough antioxidants running through my system
to ensure that i never die .
where are you ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
i followed the paper trail on the whole howard thing .
that was fast .
i found out who moved the money . it wasn &apos;t howard .
who was it ?
david lee .
makes sense .
what &apos;s his angle ? is he embezzling ?
no idea .
alicia probably has a better sense of it than me .
okay . i &apos;ll see if i can use this .
and don &apos;t become a stranger , okay ?
hey , never , lucca . you know me .
that &apos;s what i mean .
i do know you . and i like alicia .
ouch . what &apos;d i do ?
what you always do .
flirt with everyone .
all right , can i go now , mom ?
behave . please .
always .
i found her-- the youth minister .
oh , thank god . where is she ?
she joined the hillary supporters . what ? !
since when ?
we &apos;re not gonna be viable .
* mine eyes have seen the glory *
* of a dozen tiny towns *
* he is trampling out the bullying ... *
oh , my god , make it stop . please .
* the sadness , and the frowns *
‭ * he has loosed his faithful alicia on every iowan town *
* his campaign is marching on ... *
he &apos;s working for one of the other candidates . he has to be .
we can &apos;t drag him out of here .
* peter , peter *
we &apos;ll just create a scene .
* peter florrick *
it already is a scene .
* peter , peter *
* peter florrick *
i can &apos;t stop it .
why not ?
* peter , peter , peter florrick *
* his truth *
* is marching on *
people like him .
this can &apos;t really be happening , can it ?
* peter , peter *
* peter florrick *
i told you iowa is different .
* peter , peter *
* peter florrick *
* his truth is marching on *
to the white house !

that &apos;s a 79 @-@ vote margin--
in this bellwether precinct that counts as an order of magnitude .
ruth , i &apos;m a convert .
i don &apos;t know what you did in there !
it was a group effort .
well , keep on paving the way to the promised land .
doing my best , sir .
this next precinct is pivotal .
one second .
hillary won &apos;t be pleased .
it &apos;s one precinct .
we got a very long way to go .

iowa caucuses .
it is , with 51 counties in her column ,
希拉里 · 克林顿 51个县提名
hillary rodham clinton .
uh , second place , governor-- that keeps us in the game .
and for second place , here it is ,
it &apos;s coming through now ...
伯尼 · 桑德斯 27个县提名
with 27 counties , bernie sanders .
and for third place , martin o &apos;malley .
马丁 · 奥马利 17个县提名
it looks like all the candidates finished pretty much as predicted .
the big surprise , though ,
is peter florrick , from neighboring illinois .
彼得 · 福瑞克 4个县提名
he finished a distant fourth .
a very distant fourth .
florrick won a meager four out of 99 counties ,
polk and the three he visited yesterday .
it looks like his full grassley wasn &apos;t full enough .

jackie ...
i &apos;m sorry .
do you know what was invented in iowa ?
no .
neither do i. because iowa has contributed nothing
to our union , and i don &apos;t understand why a state
so insignificant gets the right
to kick off a presidential primary .
do you want to go home ?
no .
i want to settle this tonight .
well , the $ 2.2 million in howard &apos;s account--
it was put there by david lee .
howard knew nothing about it .
so howard was telling the truth ?
yes .
and he isn &apos;t senile ?
he isn &apos;t .
that is good news .
where are you going ?
to my fiance .
howard ...
i &apos;m awake . i &apos;m awake .
i &apos;m sorry , sweetheart , i should never have doubted you .
everybody makes mistakes .
worst one of all doubting me .
let &apos;s just forget about this silly prenup .
you sure ?
it seemed your son was pretty serious about it .
he won &apos;t push it . not after tonight .
what do you mean , tonight ?
he lost the presidency .
sorry .
so am i.
i hope we have some time together .
mm . we will .
promise .
you overreached .
you sweet @-@ talked peter ,
convinced him he could win the presidency .
you attacked the frontrunner and ended up alienating voters .
i don &apos;t need the monday morning quarterbacking , eli .
i did exactly as you would have .
followed the polling data ...
for any other candidate , yes .
but not this one .
you were with him 24 / 7 for months ,
and you missed the most fundamental thing about the man .
peter florrick is not number one .
not nationally .
she is .
yes , eli , we all know
hillary rodham clinton is a giant .
no , not hillary .
alicia .
