all of a sudden , so much is happening .
i know . ross is getting married .
phoebe &apos;s making people .
everybody &apos;s doing stuff .
we just sit here .
if i died , people would know i was here ...
... only by the ass print on this chair !
what are we doing ?
wasting our lives .
i meant for lunch .
we have to do something . something huge !
we could climb mt . everest .
not something stupid . something huge !
i saw an ad for this video .
people climb that thing every day . we could totally do that !
why not ? i mean , it &apos;s just climbing .
it &apos;s just steep ! -yeah .
we &apos;re going ! it &apos;d be nice to leave an ass print on everest .
what &apos;s up ?
we &apos;re gonna climb mt . everest .
yeah , baby !
i looked into that .
yeah , but it costs like $ 60,000 , and , you know , you could die .
and you would die .
we could get that everest video .
we could do that without risking our lives at all .
while we &apos;re at the video store , we could rent die hard !
i just remembered.that everest thing is only available through mail order .
so you &apos;ll stay here and hang out with me ?
but one of these days ... we &apos;ll get off our butts
and rent die hard again !
the one with the lnvitation
that was fast . it usually takes me hours to get ben to go down for his nap .
he &apos;s such a sweetheart . do you know what he said ?
good night , mommy .
that &apos;s because he has lots of mommies .
yeah , in fact , it &apos;s kind of become his word for &quot; woman . &quot;
so does your uncle nathan get an invite or not ?
oh , god ! nobody likes him .
he &apos;s so cheap . he &apos;d never fly to london in a million years .
invite him !
did i do these neat enough ?
yeah , they &apos;re fine .
we &apos;ll say that ben addressed them .
you invited rachel then ?
sure , why not ?
really ?
i wouldn &apos;t be comfortable having any of my old lovers there .
do you think we shouldn &apos;t invite her ?
you know i absolutely adore rachel.it &apos;s just
that i thought it might be awkward for you.but it &apos;s absolutely your decision .
more tea ?

i don &apos;t want to be single , okay ? i just want to be married again .
and i just want a million dollars !

back in high school ...
i had a major crush on you .
i knew.you did ?
i figured you thought i was monica &apos;s geeky brother .
i did .

try not to let my intense vulnerability become a factor .
would it be okay if i asked you out sometime ?
maybe .
okay , maybe i will .
see , i see ... big passion in your future .
really ?
i do .
ross , you &apos;re so great .
it &apos;s never gonna happen .
i have a question .
actually , it &apos;s not so much a question.it &apos;s more of a general wondering ... ment .
well , for a while now , i &apos;ve been wanting to ....
yes , yes.that &apos;s right .
look !
what ?
top of the world looking down on creation
and the only explanation i can find

you were incredible !
a brand @-@ new woman , ladies and gentlemen .
i could not have done this without you .
more clothes in the dryer ?
i &apos;m fine .
you had no right to tell me you had feelings for me .
i was doing great with julie before i found out .
i was doing great too . it &apos;s not easy for me to see you with julie .
i don &apos;t need this right now.it &apos;s too late .
i &apos;m with somebody else . this ship has sailed !
all right , fine ! go ahead and do that .
i don &apos;t need your stupid ship !
good , good
this is the first time i &apos;m doing something i care about .
i &apos;m doing something that i &apos;m actually good at .
if you don &apos;t get that
i get that , but i &apos;m tired of your answering machine .
i don &apos;t know what to do.neither do l !
is this about mark ?
oh , my god ! okay , it &apos;s not .
i can &apos;t keep having this same fight over and over again .
you &apos;re making this too hard !
i am ? what do you want me to do ? i don &apos;t know .
look , maybe we should just take a break .
you &apos;re right . let &apos;s cool off .
let &apos;s get some frozen yogurt or something .
a break from us .
why are we rushing ?

i want you to leave . get out !
i want to talk about this .
all right , how was she ?
what ?
was she good ?
don &apos;t answer !
you wanted to talk about it . how was she ?
she was ....
she was not good , not good .
nothing compared to you .
she was different .
good different ?
nobody likes change .
just stop !
the way you owned up to everything.it &apos;s just showed me how much you &apos;ve grown , you know ?
i mean , my mom never thought this would work out .
she was all , &quot; once a cheater , always a cheater . &quot;
i just wish we hadn &apos;t lost those four months .
but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective .
we were on a break !
you seem to really like her .
what do i do ? we agreed it &apos;d be a two @-@ week thing .
no commitment .
that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends ... asking to hear stories about you
... iooking through monica &apos;s photo albums .
you don &apos;t do that if you &apos;re just in it for two weeks .
you think ?
you &apos;ve got 14 hours until she has to be at the airport .
and you &apos;re sitting here in a hallway ... with a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cheerleader with a fat lip .
you &apos;re right . -yeah .
this is so amazing !
my brother &apos;s getting married and in london ! it &apos;s so romantic .

i knew that .
so i didn &apos;t know that . but you should see your faces .

that &apos;s ross &apos; .
oh , my god !
he remembered.remembered what ?
it was months ago . we were walking by this antique store .
i saw this and told him it was like one my grandmother had ... when i was a little girl .
i can &apos;t believe he remembered !

remember when he fell in love with carol ... and got her that expensive crystal duck ?
what did you just say ?
oh , my god !

i got a message from you .
oh , my god ! hang up the phone ! give me the phone
you &apos;re over me ? oh , god .

no , you just rolled over the juice box .
did you say anything to rachel about me and the girl from the copy place ?
i &apos;m sorry.was i not supposed to ?
you ended it !
because i was mad at you . not because i stopped loving you .
you still love me ?
what does this mean ? do you want to get back together ?

i don &apos;t know .
i just , i feel ....
i can &apos;t believe i even thought of getting back together . we &apos;re so over !
fine by me !
and hey ! just so you know , it &apos;s not that common .
it doesn &apos;t happen to every guy , and it is a big deal .
i knew it !
rachel &apos;s coming up . doesn &apos;t she look pretty ?
oh , my god ! this is us getting ready for the prom .
we don &apos;t have to watch this .
yeah , we do ! come on !

there she is !
shut up ! the camera adds 10 pounds .
so how many cameras are actually on you ?
dad , turn it off !
it is off.right , ross ?
looking good , mr. kotter !
i can &apos;t go to my prom without a date . it &apos;s too late .
if you &apos;re not going , then i don &apos;t want to go either .
i have a wonderful idea.you should take rachel to the prom .
we &apos;ve seen enough . let &apos;s turn it off .
i want to see ! -fine , i &apos;m not going to watch .
come on , kid . let &apos;s go .
are you handsome ! let &apos;s show them !
okay , dad .
rachel , ready or not .
here comes your knight in shining
oh , dear ! how do i turn this off ?
i can &apos;t believe you did that.yeah , well ....
see ? he &apos;s her lobster !
no.you &apos;re really not going ?
it &apos;s just going to be too hard .
you know , i mean ... it &apos;s ross .
how can i watch him get married ?
it &apos;s just for the best . you know ? it is .
plus somebody &apos;s got to stay here with phoebe.she &apos;s going to be pretty big by then .
she &apos;ll need someone to help her tie her shoes .
drive her to the hospital if she goes into labor .
you don &apos;t have a car.and your license expired .
there &apos;s so much to do , and i have so little time !
check this out.there &apos;s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums .
&quot; it &apos;s almost as good as being there . &quot;
it &apos;s better ! you can &apos;t go to a museum in your underwear .
you could , but just the one time .
we could get videos of the sights ...
... get a vcr in our hotel room and never have to go outside !
lf we do that , we &apos;ve got to rent die hard .
