but we did . you sucked my face .
i sucked your face
you did .

you totally sucked my face .

第二季 第十七集
i park under an overpass .
guys , guys , guys , guys .
we all have crappy parking .
guys , why don &apos;t we just all share the spot ?
we &apos;ll each get it for a day and a half every week ,
and then we split sunday into six @-@ hour shifts .
does it say &quot; share stuff &quot; in the constitution of america ?
no , it does not . nicholas , what does it say ?
don &apos;t share stuff .
no one deserves that spot more than i do .
you know ? &apos; cause lord knows , i &apos;ve done my fair ...
share of ...
spotworthy things .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m sorry . daisy travels so much ,
and i work at night , so ,
you know , our sex window is like ...
i &apos;ve lived in this loft as long , if not longer , than anyone .
i have the crummiest room , i &apos;m on 24 @-@ hour grout watch .
i pay the lion &apos;s share of the utilities , do i not ?
i refuse to pay for the wiffi .
it &apos;s wifi .
i didn &apos;t even have to tell you guys about the spot .
why did i tell you guys about the spot ?
oh , damn it ! i &apos;m the dumbest boy in school !
as the only woman in the loft ...
don &apos;t play the lady card .
i will play the lady card .
race card .
lazy drunk card .
deserves @-@ the @-@ spot card .
do i not , every day , have to deal with outside dave ?
dave ? i have to use my car now , dave .
i work so hard , i just want some sleep !
dave , i &apos;m gonna go get some coffee .
um , can i get you anything ?
2 % latte .
he throws dentures at me , he doesn &apos;t like cookies .
because i believe so strongly in women &apos;s equality ,
i refuse to give you preferential treatment .
well , that &apos;s really cool , schmidt . i really ...
wait a minute .
sex window .
now , if you all will excuse me ,
i am about to go and park my car on her parking spot .
ew . ew ! get out .
as if there was anything more important than this .
i still want the spot , though .
obviously not getting the spot .
and then there were three .
that &apos;s right .
just the way i want it .
come on ! it &apos;s a good job , guys .
yes !
how do you two care about stuff so much ?
well , you know what this means , jessica , don &apos;t you ?
nicholas miller is now a swing vote .
what ? no !
he &apos;s right ,
&apos;cause we &apos;re both voting for ourselves ,
so that makes you the decider .
you two are on your own . i &apos;m out .
you can &apos;t escape destiny .
she comes for us all , that relentless bitch .
that &apos;s right . destiny &apos;s a lady .
destiny might be a lady , but victory has a penis .
direct quote-- scott caan .
yup .
hey .
i found one of your hoodies ,
and i borrowed it .
you want to know what i &apos;m wearing underneath this shirt ?
yeah , sure .
an invisible shirt .
i &apos;m confused , jess .
these are so long .
i wouldn &apos;t put that in your mouth .
do you chew on this ?
i do .
mmm . you do , huh ?
it &apos;s crunchy .
you get hit in the head or something ?
are you flirting with me to get the spot ?
how dare you accuse me of that .
the parking spot is yours .
really ?
yeah .
thanks , nick . that &apos;s so cool of you .
sometimes i can be a gentleman , believe it or not .
cool . all right .
well , thank you .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
get in here . yeah , we can ...
let &apos;s hug this out .
purple nurple !
thank you .
i don &apos;t know why i did that . i &apos;ll get ice .
why did you do that ?
oh , finally . what took you so long ?
i said 2 : 45 , not 3 : 08 .
i couldn &apos;t follow your directions .
i &apos;m telling you , girl , this complex is like a maze .
every building in this place looks exactly the same .
and for future reference ,
i &apos;m more of a left @-@ right kind of guy ,
not so much a north @-@ south kind of guy .
put on a condom .
hmm ... i don &apos;t , uh ...
you forgot a condom ?
you got a grocery bag ?
no .
tin foil ?
no .
hand sanitizer ?
no .
you got a shower cap and a twist tie ?
you didn &apos;t bring the one thing we need to have sex ?
what about a baseball cap that &apos;s really small ?
are you serious ?
um , i got quick reflexes .
mm , i &apos;m gonna take care of this , okay ?
okay , well , look , do not waste my time .
i will be back faster than you can say ,
&quot; damn , winston , i took care of myself already . &quot;
don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t say that , though .
do not ... wait for me . wait ...
who wants an ice @-@ cold heisler ,
all dressed up in a frosty mug ?
sure . i like beer .
i know you haven &apos;t officially decided
on the spot yet , but i just wanted to say , thanks , man .
what for , schmidt ?
we both know that you &apos;re gonna give the spot to me ,
but i love that you &apos;re keeping up the charade .
spot &apos;s going to jess .
jess ?
jess .
give me the beer back .
i &apos;m trying to be a gentleman .
hey , schmidt . hey , nick .
how you doing ?
good . how are you ?
good .
what the hell ?
what ... the hell ?
i &apos;m checking my e @-@ mails .
oh . okay .
think that i &apos;m blind ? think i can &apos;t smell it ?
you think i can &apos;t hear it ?
the stench of filth and lust is all over this room .
smells like freaking tijuana .
what ... happened here ?
nothing .
hardly anything .
hardly anything ? !
you know i &apos;m not good at this , jess .
shut up . okay , fine .
we kissed . eh .
it was nothing . so ? uh , moving on .
don &apos;t be weird about this , schmidt .
remember ... i mean , it was like a dare , basically .
yeah .
mazel ... tov
to the both of you .
well , i don &apos;t know what &quot; mazel tov &quot; means ,
but it doesn &apos;t sound good .
excuse me ,
excuse me , sorry about that .
emergency . emergency . sorry about that .
i need a condom .
that &apos;ll be $ 8.75 .
all right .
what the hell ? what the ... ?
damn it , took daisy &apos;s pants .
look , i don &apos;t have any money right now ,
but , you know , i have somebody waiting for me ,
so if you could just , you know ?
next .
wait . no . no , no , no , no .
uh , look , what about that box of condoms right there , man ?
they &apos;re practically open , right ?
how about you just slide one out and throw a brother a loosie ?
next .
hey , everybody .
what &apos;s up ?
my name is winston bishop ,
and i am in desperate need ... of a condom .
okay , that &apos;s it .
now hear me out .
okay ? okay .
come on . sorry , folks .
hey , schmidt ?
hello , schmidt ? you okay ?
who ? me ?
yeah .
yeah , look , guys , i &apos;m fine .
look , i admit , at first i was thrown , but i &apos;m fine .
are you seriously doing this ? !
i can &apos;t believe this ! this is so dumb !
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m trying to process this whole thing .
nick , you &apos;re my best friend , and you should have told me .
and jess , what do you think ? mono is just some sort of joke ?
nothing has changed .
like same old , same old .
except for the fact that , uh ,
pre @-@ kiss jess didn &apos;t have a parking spot .
post @-@ kiss jess does .
sounds ... like ... change .
i won the spot fair and square , schmidt .
did you , though ?
i wouldn &apos;t say fair and square .
all right . fine .
i used my body . is that what you want to hear ?
i shook what the good people of oregon gave me ,
and i got a parking space .
let me tell you something , nicholas miller .
you know , had winston kissed me ,
you &apos;re the first person i would have told !
i know you would have told me if winston kissed you .
but i guess your loyalty lies elsewhere .
i can &apos;t handle this !
fine . schmidt , congratulations .
the spot is yours .
okay . really .
it &apos;s him .
what ? ! nick miller , you weakling .
i can &apos;t have people thinking my decision wasn &apos;t above board .
this city can &apos;t have another scandal !
wise choice .
thanks .
he &apos;s been manipulating you the whole time .
look at him .
i don &apos;t think ...
look at his smi-- he &apos;s smiling evilly .
you know what , jess ? stop .
you &apos;re manipulating me , he &apos;s manipulating me ,
and i &apos;m getting confused .
i am the decider of us three !
i decide !
let the decider decide !
i am not the suggester !
i &apos;m not having a good time with this game .
give my regards to outside dave .
stay away from my space ...
or you &apos;ll have this to deal with .
where are your nipples , man ?
i &apos;ll never tell .
you &apos;re either gonna break your finger ,
or you &apos;re gonna break that button .
i &apos;m not going back in there . it &apos;s too weird .
you &apos;re the one making it weird , nick .
you want weird ? i &apos;ll give you weird .
weird , weird , weird .
fine . weirder , weirder , weirder .
weird , weird , weird .
uh , weird , ugh , ugh .

i don &apos;t know ! you started it !
is this how it &apos;s gonna be ? is it ?
what are we talking about , jess ?
you think things like this aren &apos;t gonna come up all the time ?
we need a long @-@ term solution .
i &apos;ll give you a long @-@ term solution .
i &apos;m taking the spot !
oh , my god .

it won &apos;t start .

don &apos;t you do it , schmidt .
i &apos;m not afraid .
schmidt , no .
you just hit me .
damn right i did .

over a parking spot , schmidt .

and an empty bladder .

i &apos;m here all night .
i &apos;m here all night .
i-- that &apos;s what i said .
i &apos;m really happy you gave me another shot .
yeah , so am i.
you know , you , you can &apos;t judge someone based on their friends .
no , and i feel like , if you gave them another chance ,
you &apos;d really like them .
they are down to earth and chill , no drama .
yeah ?
hi cece , it &apos;s winston !
you got a rubber ? !
i need a rubber !
he said &quot; rhubarb , &quot; that &apos;s how he pronounces &quot; rhubarb . &quot;
it &apos;s so weird .
nah , nah , i @-@ i need a condom
for my penis !
what are you doing ?
okay , we are not close enough for this .
all right , we have spent very little time together .
you are the only person that i know in this neighborhood .
don &apos;t you dare come in my house .
hey , man , hey .
hey .
i &apos;m winston , good to see you again .
shivrang . hi .
you got a condom on you ?
oh , no , no , look , that &apos;s not-- we &apos;re , um ...
her mother and my mother ...
i &apos;m a chemical engineer .
winston .
look , shivrang , man to man , i know you have a condom
in your wallet , but my question to you is : do you actually think
you &apos;re gonna get lucky with a sexy lady like that ?
you know , i feel like i &apos;m getting lucky
by just being here .
be honest with me .
okay , fine , i &apos;ve got a condom .
aha .
winston .
is he going to need that condom tonight ?
oh , god .
i &apos;m gonna punch you in the face .
shall i give you a minute to think about it ?
&apos;cause i can wait .
i &apos;m gonna wring your damn neck .
this is awful , like , really ...
okay , okay .
get out .
honestly , physically removing you now .
i &apos;m going .
out of my house .
it &apos;s a sour ball , not a bank safe .
just open the candy .
are you hungry ?
yes , i &apos;m starving .
why don &apos;t you go upstairs to the kitchen ?
it &apos;s full of food .
just give me the damn candy .
go get it .
wait , no , no , no .
okay , i have , like , a stabbing pain , it &apos;s--
and it &apos;s , and it &apos;s like right here .
it &apos;s my pishy .
i , i have to pish .
i think we should take a break .
leave and you &apos;re out .
drown in your own urine .
i got to find a condom .
i need a condom !
but i still want the spot .
come on , come on , come on , nick , come on .
okay .
condom , condom , condom .
damn it .
here we go ... here we go .
i mean , she &apos;s either having crazy amounts of sex
or she does not know how to use these things .
oh , just focus , man , bring it in .
absorb it .
yeah .
did you just pee inside your body ?
yes .
this is your fault , nick .
you compromised the whole loft .
we had an agreement .
when jessica day signed that lease ,
you , me , and coach all took a no @-@ nail oath .
no @-@ nail oath ?
i didn &apos;t break the no @-@ nail oath .
your mouth nailed her mouth .
for the record , no one nailed my mouth .
that &apos;s important to me .
also , we didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
do you know nothing about men ?
yeah , i know nothing about men .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m wearing a short skirt and wool tights .
a woman cannot be in close quarters with three men
and kiss one of them .
what fuels men ?
competition and sex .
that &apos;s why the united nations was formed ,
that &apos;s why girls aren &apos;t allowed on pirate ships ,
and that is why there is
a no @-@ nail oath in apartment 4d ,
and deep down inside , nick knows that i &apos;m right .
back me up here , nick .
i just want a piece of candy .
are you serious ? you didn &apos;t give me the spot
and now you won &apos;t back me up ?
you coward .
why should he ?
because he-- because ...
because , what , you kissed ,
and now he owes you some sort of emotional support and loyalty ?
reason number two for the no @-@ nail oath--
bitches be crazy .
isn &apos;t that right , nick ?
i found garbage that has chocolate on it .
daisy , i &apos;m back .
daisy .
hey , daisy , i &apos;m here !
where you at ? !
i don &apos;t have my phone ,
and all these buildings look alike , and i ...
hey , daisy !
you know daisy ?
shut up .
no ? all right , okay , cool .
now , i walked around with &quot; yum &quot;
on my butt all day .
i deserve sex-- protected sex .
daisy ... !
schmidt &apos;s right .
i thought we could go back to the way things were ,
but we can &apos;t .
you nailed my mouth ...
and you nailed it good and hard and strong .
now things have changed .
okay , but they don &apos;t have to have changed .
it &apos;s just different , nick , it is .
that kiss was the dumbest mistake i have ever made--
dumber than caroline , dumber than law school ,
dumber than when i thought it was pronounced
&quot; brock omabrama . &quot;
what ?
i thought his name was pronounced &quot; brock oma ... &quot;
it &apos;s not ...
if i could go back in time
and take back the kiss , i would .
i would take it back , i regret it .
congratulations ,
you &apos;re the proud owner of a new parking spot .
oh , you got to be kidding me .
jess , wait .
you realize , every second
that you don &apos;t run after her , you become more and more
of a buttwad , don &apos;t you ?
did you pee yourself ?
that i did , that i did .
jess .
hi .
hey , look ...
why you holding a box of fish sticks ?
because i &apos;m going to go scare the feral cats away
that live in my current parking spot , nick .
i &apos;m going to throw fish sticks at them
while singing &quot; memory , &quot; and don &apos;t you dare criticize me .
i don &apos;t regret kissing you .
i regret what it did , i regret that it made things weird .
we are roommates , you know , we got to figure this out , jess .
a no @-@ nail oath ?
you thought i was going to sleep
with one of you , like i just couldn &apos;t help it ?
it was me , jess , i couldn &apos;t help it .
you dropped your fish sticks .
shut up , nick .
ay , ay , ay .
blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah .
we &apos;re having a conversation .
will you please get out of here ?
yeah , well , that &apos;s the problem , isn &apos;t it ?
because i live here , too ,
and i &apos;m gonna be here when all of this goes to crap .
next time you guys have your dirty little thoughts
about each other , you better be thinking
about me , too ,
because i ain &apos;t going nowhere .
you are literally sitting in a puddle of your own pee .
the apartment 4d no @-@ nail oath right here :
&quot; we , the undersigned ,
&quot; agree never to nail our roommate jessica day
&quot; unless the sex can be parlayed into a business
that provides for all parties involved . &quot;
what ?
i didn &apos;t read the fine print .
&quot; if one of the undersigned nails said female ,
well , then all must nail her . &quot;
what ? !
i didn &apos;t know there was fine print .
what , what ? !
i didn &apos;t know there was fine ...
let me be very clear here-- i am a strong ,
self @-@ sufficient woman ,
and i will not be nailing you , schmidt ,
or nick or schmidt .
notice i said that twice
because i don &apos;t feel it &apos;s sinking in .
there will be no nails
or screws or hammers
in this building area generally , the whole thing .
what , do you think
that i want to do this ?
believe me , pass .
i just don &apos;t want my home
turning into a den
of sexual tension and lies .
now , do you want things to go back to normal or not ?
yes .
yes , i do , but i ...
then , i just have to kiss you .
this is just one of those things-- let &apos;s just do it ...
no , i @-@ i ...
... get past it , we move on .
i think that &apos;s a bad idea .
nick , you &apos;re into this , right ?
i don &apos;t know , might help .
are you serious ?
i don &apos;t know .
ok , fine , just get over here , do it and do it fast .
i &apos;ll be a hero .
bring it on .
no , no .
mistake .
it was really a mistake .
nick , i made it wireder .
is everyone in the world having sex but me ?
all people , foreigners , nerds , everyone is banging .
schmidt and jess ?
everyone is out there getting and giving except for old winnie .
look at me , a man who has absolutely nothing .
i left my phone , my wallet and my dignity
at daisy &apos;s house .
i even left my pants there , look at this .
yum , hahaha .
i need a win . damn it , i need a win .
you need a win , pal ?
it &apos;s a little tight in here .
are you sure this isn &apos;t too tight ?
ok , um ...
this ain &apos;t gonna work . this ain &apos;t gonna work for me .
um ... i &apos;m stuck , guys ?
hey , guys . where y &apos;all ?
guys , guys ...
guys , hello ?
