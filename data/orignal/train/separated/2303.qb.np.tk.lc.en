第二十三集
why are we going to take it out of storybrooke ?
to destroy it .
zelena !
it must have something to do with
magic being tied to that bloody crystal !
we &apos;re certainly not in storybrooke anymore .
if you really don &apos;t want to worry about something ,
you lock it into a cage --
it &apos;s when you unlock the cage ...
... that &apos;s when the trouble starts .
much as i want to give in to evil , i don &apos;t .
... the evil queen can &apos;t return , so ...
there &apos;s no redemption for me .
i &apos;m trapped .
if the dark one ever wishes to see his wife again ...
... he &apos;ll have to do exactly as i say .
you almost got free .
sorry it didn &apos;t work out .
that &apos;s the thing about you , hyde .
you &apos;re not half as clever as you think .
did you get into your own rum ?
you believe that &apos;s going to work when my magic can &apos;t ?
well , i suppose i could just do nothing ,
but then again , that &apos;s your job !
if you really want to get out of here ,
i can arrange a trip right back to the underworld !
stop it !
now , we need to be patient .
the groundsman promised
to fix the wand and bring it back to us .
unfortunately , i was only able to keep half my promise .
what do you mean ?
where &apos;s the wand ?
i repaired it , but then the warden took it from me .
i didn &apos;t come empty @-@ handed , though .
seems the orderly ,
he enjoyed a little bit too much whiskey today .
we need to get the wand back from that warden .
do you know where he is ?
eh , no , uh , but first things first ,
before we find him , we must have a way to defeat him .
he &apos;s quite powerful .
now , i might have a way , but it is dangerous .
hasn &apos;t stopped us before .
i just went to hell and back .
i &apos;m not afraid of your warden .
then follow me .
bloody hell .
where are we ?
it &apos;s like all the realms all at once .
you &apos;re closer than you think .
this land is a refuge
filled with outcasts from all over .
each forced to flee their problems .
each finding safe haven here .
forced to flee from what ?
well , the reasons are as varied as the populace ,
and everyone has their own tale .
that &apos;s why this place has come to be known
as &quot; the land of untold stories . &quot;
it &apos;s a tad ironic of a name , no ,
given that this land is seemingly filled with stories .
perhaps , but there &apos;s only one story
we need to worry about right now . that &apos;s our own .
right , and that story better end
with us getting back to our world .
henry .
henry , will you stop ?
your moms told us to wait back in the library .
they could be in trouble .
and since when do you care what they say ?
you already ran away with me .
you lied about the dark grail .
henry .
i know you &apos;re scared .
and if you really think this is the best thing to do ,
i &apos;ll help you .
thank you .
but i hope you have a good plan ,
because we don &apos;t have magic
and we have no idea where you grandfather is .
actually , i think i do .
well , don &apos;t just stand there .
here is your dinner , sir .
the spaghetti bolognese .
i &apos;m so sorry .
the kitchen must have made a mistake .
i &apos;ll get it fixed right away .
no need .
the meal is irrelevant .
this is sterling silver ?
yes .
you can leave .
actually , there is one more thing .
things might get messy here .
yeah .
gold might have magic on his side .
but he sure isn &apos;t subtle .
if i know henry , ? he &apos;s already disobeyed us .
we should call ? and tell him to stay put .
which would work ? if i hadn &apos;t torched his phone .
what the hell ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s granny . something &apos;s happened in storybrooke .
my parents , hook , and your sister
were pulled through some kind of portal .
again ?
to where ?
granny is an expert on lasagna , not magic .
all she says is that they vanished with the sorcerer &apos;s wand
and never came back .
regina .
they might all be in danger .
we have to bring them home .
well , the only way to do that
is to get our magic back from gold .
what are you doing ? we need a plan .
i have one . i still have a fist .
gold still has a nose .
if you don &apos;t like it , i &apos;ll do this alone .
i get it . i want to help my family , too ,
but we have to be smart about this .
didn &apos;t you see the sign ?
we need to talk .
alone .
the savior doesn &apos;t even know i &apos;m here .
so , what makes you think
i have any interest in talking to you ?
because the storm clouds outside tell me
you haven &apos;t been able to wake belle yet .
and apparently , it &apos;s not from a lack of trying .
seems to me like you can use the help of your best student .
yes , but we both know that &apos;s not you , dearie .
my best student was a queen .
you have her buried under layers
of tasteful cotton and good intentions .
such a pity .
what if i told you i was ready to let her back out ?
what if i told you i am sick of losing everyone i care about ?
well , i &apos;d say , &quot; what &apos;s changed ? &quot;
zelena .
she &apos;s in trouble .
all because the heroes convinced her
to use the sorcerer &apos;s wand ,
and now they &apos;re trapped in another realm .
what makes you think i would ever help zelena ?
because you need me .
you need the evil queen .
i don &apos;t want to lose one more person i love .
not after what happened to robin hood .
well , perhaps you &apos;re right .
perhaps we can help one another .
may i ?
now , let &apos;s talk about finding your sister .
yes , this is where i lived
when i was still a doctor at the hospital .
so , not many maids ? with untold stories , then .
what &apos;s that ?
a serum i created ,
designed to separate the good from the evil in someone .
it &apos;s what we &apos;re going to use to defeat the warden .
well , how ? i didn &apos;t exactly see any good in him .
uh , it -- it &apos;s there .
and the good has been fighting to get out for a long time ,
but it never could .
till now .
the flower --
it &apos;s from the vine you were trimming back in the garden .
yes . the final ingredient .
if only he knew i was growing it right under his nose .
actually , he did . back off !
i don &apos;t understand .
you -- you were passed out drunk .
i let you get away so you could finish your serum .
now let &apos;s show the warden what you &apos;ve done .
get away !
what did you do to him ?
you have to run !
david , i think i know what story our good doctor is from .
dr. jekyll , which means he &apos;s ...
mr. hyde .
the warden -- mr. who ? who &apos;s mr. hyde ?
you know what i say ?
shoot first , ask questions later !
jekyll was right .
run !
run .
no .
to helping one another once again .
speaking of , where is belle ?
she was taken --
or rather pandora &apos;s box was taken with her in it .
how ?
i didn &apos;t know how till you arrived .
it was the sorcerer &apos;s wand .
zelena must be trapped because someone &apos;s taken it from her ,
which means they &apos;re both in the same realm .
and you --
well , you &apos;re gonna help me find it , your majesty .
help yourself to a drink , ms. swan .
i think i &apos;ll pass .
you knew .
of course i knew .
you &apos;ve changed , regina .
the loss of one man isn &apos;t gonna push you back over the edge .
not anymore .
for better or worse , this is now who you are .
guilt @-@ ridden and weak .
i only let you in because i needed this .
something connected to zelena so you can find them .
indeed .
and now that i have it ,
i have no need for either of you .
gold .
stop .
henry , get out of here .
there &apos;s nothing you can do .
yes , there is .
no .
henry .
what have you done ?
i destroyed magic .
now , poole , you might want to go into the other room .
so nice to finally meet you , doctor .
hyde .
i &apos;ve heard so much about you .
you &apos;re even more disappointing in person .
so weak .
so pathetic .
i was actually impressed that you had the courage
to try to finish that serum of yours in secret .
i had no choice .
being with you was destroying me .
but do you see the irony ?
being separate is ...
... what &apos;s going to destroy you .
i don &apos;t think so , mate !
i &apos;ve been waiting to do that .
doctor .
i told you to run .
no . you risked everything to save us .
we had to do the same .
to be clear , i was fine running .
now i &apos;m going to kill you all .
leave it . it &apos;s of no use to us now .
and we don &apos;t want to be here when he wakes up .
have you any idea what you &apos;ve just done ?
stopped you from hurting my moms and anybody else .
you stopped me from rescuing belle ,
not to mention your family ,
who are now trapped in the same realm with her !
what &apos;s he talking about ?
david , snow , hook , and zelena are in another realm right now .
and thanks to you ,
we have no way of helping them get back .
i did what i had to .
this isn &apos;t on me .
it &apos;s on you .
henry .
i &apos;ll make sure he doesn &apos;t go far .
storybrooke .
henry rid it of its magic .
what happened to it ?
storybrooke survived for 28 years without magic .
i &apos;m sure it can manage a few more .
you said it would be destroyed .
yes , when i had to motivate you to find your wayward son .
what should we do ? call the police ?
see how he does without his powers in a real prison ?
that &apos;s an excellent idea .
not if you want my help finding the one person
who may still have magic .
what are you talking about ?
you said this was a land without magic !
it is . and it isn &apos;t .
enough with the riddles . who has magic ?
well , for that answer , it looks like
we &apos;re just gonna have to learn to work together now .
all right , i &apos;ll go with gold
and make sure he keeps his hands off this crystal .
you find henry .
can we have a second ?
of course .
how &apos;d you know where to find me ?
because when we lived in new york ,
this is where we came when you were upset .
and i &apos;d give you a penny
and tell you to wish your problems away .
remember ?
what do you say ?
want to give it a try ?
i &apos;m sorry , mom ,
but that &apos;s not gonna make me feel better now .
why not ?
when we lived here , there wasn &apos;t any magic .
we didn &apos;t even know it existed .
and , mom , we were happy .
we were .
and i wouldn &apos;t trade that time for anything .
but you &apos;re forgetting something .
it was just the two of us . and now --
yeah .
and that &apos;s why i thought if i destroyed magic
in storybrooke ? that we could all be happy
like you and i were .
but because of what i did ,
we &apos;ll never even see half of our family again .
that may not be true .
your mom is with gold to try to find a way .
should we see if they had any luck ?
why didn &apos;t you believe me
when i told you i wanted to help you ?
wondering if you &apos;ve lost your edge ?
or hoping you finally managed to bury the evil queen
deep enough inside that i wouldn &apos;t buy it ?
don &apos;t try to psychoanalyze me .
look . let me give you a friendly piece of advice .
partitioning the darkness inside
will not help you become the woman you want to be .
it worked so far .
has it ?
you know , i once thought i could contain the darkness
to one tiny corner of my soul .
first for baelfire , then for belle .
and i always failed . do you want to know why ?
because i like the darkness .
it &apos;s as much who i am as the light .
why can &apos;t you seem to grasp it &apos;s not either / or ?
because i &apos;m not like you .
i don &apos;t like the darkness .
you can tell yourself what you like .
but deep down , ? the evil queen is who you are .
and the more you keep her locked inside ,
the more you &apos;re gonna suffer .
what the hell is this place ?
greetings .
what brings you to my humble shop ?
well , we &apos;re in the market for something
a little more powerful than what you have on display .
if you mean narcotics , i &apos;m just a simple herbalist .
i don &apos;t think so .
regina , meet the dragon .
good to see you &apos;re breathing again .
i hear one of my father &apos;s minions paid you a visit .
peter pan was powerful , but i &apos;m resilient .
i assume you &apos;re here because you want something ,
rumplestiltskin .
but i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not in the business
of helping hearts filled with such darkness .
gold , this is a waste of time .
but you ...
you i will help .
i see a noble battle deep inside your soul , regina ,
between light and dark .
and for that , i will do my best to aid you .
it is imperative you win ...
for all of us .
there . look .
where the hell is that ?
wherever it is , they &apos;re in trouble .
we need to get through so we can help them .
i &apos;m afraid opening a portal to that realm is beyond my power .
you can &apos;t give up .
my family , they &apos;re in trouble .
i &apos;ve done all i can .
but you ...
... you haven &apos;t .
me ?
all of you .
just because the boy destroyed storybrooke &apos;s magic
doesn &apos;t mean there isn &apos;t any in this world .
oh , really ? because i think there &apos;s a reason
they call this place the land without magic .
yes , because that &apos;s how it appears .
there &apos;s magic everywhere if you &apos;re willing to see it .
that sounds an awful lot like something
a friend told me a long time ago .
august ?
yes .
i know who you are , savior .
if you want to find magic , remember ...
what he taught you .
&quot; you have to believe . &quot;
so , how do you suggest we do that ?
after all , saying you believe doesn &apos;t make it so .
i know how .
how is that going to help us ?
because there &apos;s magic in it .
every time someone makes a wish .
i don &apos;t think throwing a coin in a fountain
is what the dragon was talking about .
all due respect , grandpa ,
but i think that was exactly what he was talking about .
mom , when we were living in new york ,
do you remember the last time you took me here ?
yeah . i don &apos;t know . ? you were upset about something .
maybe something at school ?
it was because of you .
i could tell you were lonely ,
so i wished our family would be complete ,
and do you know what happened a few days later ?
hook came to new york ,
and he brought us back to storybrooke
and we were reunited with our family .
there was magic .
it was right here .
we just didn &apos;t know it .
don &apos;t you see ?
we just need to wish they were back .
i wish we were reunited with our family .
come on .
it can &apos;t just be me .
everybody make a wish .
this will work . i promise .
okay , kid .
emma . did you see that ?
sometimes that boy surprises me .
we just need more .
well , we can blend in here , but so can hyde .
he could be anywhere .
is there a reason your evil alter ego
doesn &apos;t look anything like you ?
and is 10 times as strong ?
everyone sees their worst self differently --
some as a mirror image , others as a literal monster .
however the mind conjures it .
well , perhaps next time , try an aggressive bunny rabbit .
all right , we got to find a way out .
over here .
hurry . this way .
seriously .
come on !
people of new york city !
my name is henry mills ,
and i need your help !
my family &apos;s in danger , but we can save them with magic !
i know how crazy it sounds .
but magic is real .
it &apos;s all around us .
you just have to be willing to see it .
you have to be willing to believe .
and i know how hard that is .
i once let my own belief waver .
but i was wrong .
we need magic .
it can make the world a better place .
i know it seems impossible .
but think about it-- at some point in your life ,
every one of you was once a believer , and at some point ,
you left that part of you behind .
but you can go back to it .
if you believe .
so , what do you say ?
will you make a wish for us ?
will you help us return magic to this world ?
we just have to make a wish !
come on ! let &apos;s go !
here , come on .
he &apos;s actually restoring magic .
see ?
i told you .
pennies .
not pennies , david .
wishes .
i don &apos;t care who &apos;s making them .
let &apos;s get out of here !
dad .
mom !
i knew you &apos;d find us , swan .
it wasn &apos;t me this time . it was all henry .
henry .
they think it was all an act .
that none of this is real .
it &apos;s okay , henry .
this is the only way they can understand .
but for a moment , they believed .
for a moment , you --
you did the impossible .
you made the world believe .
still battling against your better half , i see .
and failing .
so , you made it through that portal .
i &apos;m never one to miss an opportunity .
of course not .
and now that you &apos;re finally here , rumplestiltskin ,
you &apos;re going to help me win that battle .
because if you ever wish to see your wife
or your child @-@ to @-@ be again ,
you &apos;ll do as i ask .
the only deal i &apos;m gonna make with you
is the one where you return that box to me ,
and then , i suppose , you get to live .
i can help you ...
wake belle .
what did you just say ?
i know that she &apos;s under a sleeping curse .
i can provide you with the information to wake her .
you &apos;re lying ,
thinking it &apos;ll save your skin .
am i , now ?
i &apos;ve been the warden here to
many from all distant lands .
i &apos;ve learned much .
there is one place
that had the answer you seek .
where ?
i think it &apos;s time that we talk about a deal .
i &apos;ll never be able to thank you enough
for coming back to save me .
now that i &apos;m separated from that monster ,
i can make a fresh start of my life in your storybrooke .
still missing a crocodile .
gold wasn &apos;t in the park ?
in all the commotion , he must have slipped through
the portal to find belle .
where &apos;s regina ? wasn &apos;t she out there looking with you ?
no . she said she wanted to be alone , but she wouldn &apos;t say why .
emma , this couldn &apos;t still be about the squabble
you two had in storybrooke , could it ?
no , we solved that .
i know what this is .
it &apos;s something bigger .
i thought you might like something to keep you warm .
you know i don &apos;t do hot cocoa with cinnamon .
i know .
emma told me what &apos;s going on with you .
you don &apos;t have to go through this alone .
well , i &apos;m afraid that i do .
if i want to keep the evil queen at bay ,
i have to open myself up to a life of pain and suffering .
and if i don &apos;t keep her at bay ...
well , that &apos;s just not an option .
there has to be something we can do .
there isn &apos;t . trust me .
i even made a second wish at the fountain .
i wished the evil queen away
so i can be free of everything she did .
i did .
we forgive you , you know .
the problem is , as long as she &apos;s inside me ,
that doesn &apos;t matter .
her baggage , her karma -- call it what you want --
will always be there .
just another useless wish .
you want a fresh start .
i don &apos;t know for sure , regina ,
but maybe that wish can come true , after all .
how ?
jekyll said he didn &apos;t know how to thank us , but he found a way .
he grabbed this before we fled the lab .
it &apos;s the serum that split him from mr. hyde .
he said there &apos;s enough left for another dose .
and you think this will work on me ?
i believe that this could be the end of the evil queen ,
as long as you &apos;re sure that &apos;s what you want .
i want her gone .
then let &apos;s get rid of her .
let &apos;s be the family we were always meant to be .
all of us .
go downstairs .
jekyll said there will be a moment of disorientation
when the evil queen won &apos;t have her magic .
that &apos;s your chance . you cannot hesitate .
understood .
now , please , leave me .
i &apos;m staying .
i &apos;m staying , too .
i was there when the evil queen was born .
i kind of helped bring her into the world .
i want to see you end her .
get ready to stand back , because ...
i have a feeling we &apos;re about to meet
a very angry queen ,
and she didn &apos;t like you on a good day .
emma .
i &apos;m ready .
look at what you &apos;ve become .
regina , now &apos;s your chance . destroy her .
you destroy me ?
you don &apos;t have what it takes .
regina .
you &apos;re weak .
no matter what you do , you can &apos;t destroy our darkness .
deep down inside , you know the truth .
you need me .
no .
i don &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
home sweet home .
and in one piece .
i have to go , henry .
my dad -- i need to talk to him .
good luck .
i &apos;m sorry if i got you in trouble
for missing everyone &apos;s trip back to camelot .
it &apos;s okay .
there &apos;s something -- something i haven &apos;t told you .
my father didn &apos;t go back , because he isn &apos;t from camelot .
it &apos;s just a place he wound up in .
i -- i don &apos;t understand .
he &apos;s originally from here , this land .
from a place called connecticut .
what ?
he never felt at home in camelot , you know ?
he always said he was glad that i was born there
because , &quot; being a connecticut yankee
in king arthur &apos;s court is no great shakes . &quot;
i don &apos;t know what great shakes are ,
but i do know that i like it here .
really ?
so , i &apos;m guessing operation mixtape was a success ?
mom . come on .
we still need to un @-@ tether the magic from this thing .
it &apos;s even lovelier than you described .
well , follow me . we &apos;ll show you around .
first stop -- granny &apos;s .
killian .
what is it , love ?
you don &apos;t still feel guilty about my return , do you ?
no . just after everything we &apos;ve been through --
darkness , hades , being separated by realms --
i just wanted to say something ,
you know , when we &apos;re not in the middle of a big battle
or one of us is facing death ,
when things are just normal .
and what &apos;s that , swan ?
i love you .
well , you did it , mom . you destroyed the evil queen .
how do you feel ?
free .
now let &apos;s make sure no one can ever steal this again .
thank you for that .
i &apos;d hate to be trapped in this town without magic .
that would be truly barbaric .
mr. hyde .
how did you get here ?
gold .
he made a deal with you , didn &apos;t he ?
yes , that he did .
i provided him with some information
in exchange for storybrooke .
excuse me ?
storybrooke is mine now .
and i brought some friends .
you know , i &apos;ve been looking for a place like this
for quite some time --
a land where all the world &apos;s lost and forgotten stories
could play themselves out .
and now that i have brought them here ,
that is exactly what they &apos;re going to do .
let me tell you something , &quot; mr. hyde . &quot;
i know how your story ends .
you lose .
i wouldn &apos;t bet on it , regina .
despite what you may think ,
darkness is not as easy to snuff out
as you might believe .
evil queen .
regina never should have let me out to play .
what are you doing here ?
i came to set the record straight .
you were right about one thing , dragon .
there was a battle raging inside regina .
and she may have won the fight ,
but this ...
is a war .
and it &apos;s just begun .
the queen is back .
