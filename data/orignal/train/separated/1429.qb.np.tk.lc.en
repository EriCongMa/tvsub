good night , sweatpea .
good night , honey .
mitchell !
there &apos;s a stranger in our hot tub !
who is it ? !
you do know what &quot; stranger &quot; means , don &apos;t you ?
oh , my g -- oh , my god !
how long has he been there ?
i saw him exactly one second before you .
you know everything i know .
okay , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m calling 911 .
i &apos;m getting my bat .
maybe we &apos;re overreacting .
yeah , he could have a very good reason for be --
we should at least say hello .
it &apos;s only polite .
okay .
so i looked that coyote dead in the eye ,
and i let him know , without saying a word ,
&quot; i will not harm you ...
but i &apos;m the alpha here . &quot;
and he just stared back at me ...
mesmerized .
amazing .
turns out , barry just moved into the apartment upstairs
and thought the hot tub was for the whole building .
anyway , he &apos;s a super @-@ cool guy , and he &apos;s straight ,
so there &apos;s no weirdness .
aside from you turning into a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
i did not .
cameron , give me your arm .
okay .
what cha doin &apos; ?
oh , i &apos;m studying to be a reiki master .
what i &apos;m doing is i &apos;m transferring my positive energy
into cameron ,
and i &apos;m taking out all the negative energy .
okay .
now , do you feel that ?
i do .
does it feel warm ?
it does .
it feels warm , mitchell .
imagine that . in a hot tub .
what are you gonna do when he drives by ?
i &apos;m gonna tell him to slow down .
i think you should drag him out of his car ,
and we all get turns punching him in the stomach
until he barfs .
honey , i think i &apos;m just gonna turn over his license plate
to the police .
please .
order a pizza and call the cops .
we &apos;ll see who gets here first .
ever since they put those speed bumps on oakmont ,
some lunatic driver in a crazy sports car
has been racing down our street ,
and it is dangerous .
we &apos;ve got kids here and babies in strollers
and moms who like to jog .
she has to run every day , or she goes crazy .
she &apos;s like a border collie .
you &apos;re comparing me to a dog ?
the smartest dogs in the world .
what are you guys doing ?
what the cops won &apos;t .
we are catching that speeder ,
and when we do , he &apos;s gonna get an earful of this .
slow down , jerk !
oh ! okay ! easy .
oh , my god . mom , what are you doing ?
why are you being such a freak ? !
i am being a freak for safety .
and i &apos;m doing this for you ,
because i don &apos;t want anything bad to happen to you .
well , it &apos;s embarrassing .
mom , you need a life .
why can &apos;t you just volunteer at the museum
or bring pudding to old people ?
honey , if anybody &apos;s being embarrassing right now ,
it &apos;s you .
luke , i am your father !
that takes me back to the delivery room .
that &apos;s what i said to you
when you were coming out of your mom &apos;s lady parts .
oh , my god , dad !
oh , my god . i know those girls .
what ? are you ashamed of us ?
yes !
ooh . sweet valley high !
this is that woman from the house on seventh street !
oh , good !
yeah , if i sell it by the end of next month ,
i dethrone gil thorpe as salesman of the quarter .
that &apos;s awesome , dad .
it is awesome .
phil dunphy .
that &apos;s the speeder ! that &apos;s the speeder !
slow down , jerk ! slow down !
yeah . no . yeah , that &apos;s great .
okay , fire away .

this is gonna be my best year since 2006 .
let &apos;s go , kid . back to the salt mine .
that &apos;s okay , jay . i &apos;m biking to school today .
good for you .
there &apos;s a bunch of cool kids
who ride their bikes every day .
thought i &apos;d join them .
hey , wait . wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
what the hell is that ?
my new bike . mom got it for me yesterday .
pretty sweet , huh ?
training wheels ?
nice ones . custom made .
they don &apos;t usually come on bikes this size .
gloria !
what &apos;s wrong ?
you don &apos;t know how to ride a bike ?
i know how to ride this bike .
stephen hawking could ride that bike .
ay . what happened ?
did he fall ?
how could he fall ?
you can &apos;t send him to school
on a bike with training wheels .
they &apos;ll make fun of him .
didn &apos;t you teach him how to ride a bike ?
how could i ? i don &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
2 / 3 of my house can &apos;t do
what a billion chinese do .
my mother thought that riding a bike was dangerous .
she would say , &quot; that &apos;s how people grab you &quot; !
okay , this is how it &apos;s going down .
today i &apos;m driving you to school ,
on the weekend , i &apos;m buying you a bike ,
and i &apos;m teaching both of you .
i &apos;m nervous ...
but i &apos;m excited .
you two have fun . i pass .
it makes no sense .
there &apos;s no reason that thing should stay upright .
there &apos;s no reason you should stay upright ,
but it just works .
hey , phil . come on in .
laura , good day .
well , i couldn &apos;t love this entry any more .
it &apos;s very welcoming .
yeah , i got a thing in 10 minutes ,
so i have to make this quick .
great .
um , let me run through
my three @-@ pronged approach to selling --
i only need one prong -- sell the house .
i don &apos;t want to be that yutz
who prices her house too high
so it sits around for a year
while every lookie @-@ loo without something to do on sundays
is going through my underwear drawer .
what &apos;s the number ?
well , there are quite a few factors to take into --
need a number .
uh , we list at 1.4 .
we take anything north of 1.25 .
done !
great !
i got all the paperwork right here .
whoa , whoa , whoa . you got to buy me a beer
before you can put your hand up my sweater .
oh , i had no intention --
put on a great open house this weekend ,
the listing &apos;s yours .
bring it , laura .
you want to test me ? i &apos;ve been tested my whole life .
they could never find anything .
so , uh , sunday 12 : 00 to 4 : 00 for the open house ?
that works for you ?
great .
great . oh , and if you have any questions
or you need anything , just call .
when you work with me , you &apos;re working with a friend .
that is so sweet . i like you .
god , i hope i don &apos;t have to fire you .
hi . this is claire . leave a message .
hey , honey . it &apos;s me .
i just finished the meeting ,
and she is the perfect client .
realistic about the price ...
she wants to sell fast , and she &apos;s a real character .
you got to ... meet her .
but she &apos;s moving soon , so what &apos;s the point ?
wow , you worked late .
yes . brutal day . i just want to sit .
perfect . lily &apos;s asleep .
barry &apos;s meeting us in the hot tub .
if you &apos;re feeling stressed ,
he could give you a treatment .
ah , that &apos;s all right .
i have an appointment with dr. bigfoot tomorrow .
okay . here comes the judge .
reiki is a bunch of nonsense , cam .
that guy is a nut .
you do this every time .
we meet a new friend ,
they say one thing you don &apos;t like ,
and you just write &apos; em off .
i do not !
oh , really ? what about &quot; but yet rachel &quot; ?
&quot; i &apos;d love to go , but yet , i don &apos;t feel like parking . &quot;
it &apos;s either &quot; but &quot; or &quot; yet , &quot;
not both .
you &apos;re lucky no one &apos;s kicked your butt yet .
what about thomas ?
you wrote him off because
he serves the salad after the meal ,
which , by the way , is very common in europe .
what part of europe is he from ? pretentious @-@ stan ?
okay , fine .
keep judging . don &apos;t let anyone in .
i could care less .
i think you mean you couldn &apos;t care less ,
because if you could care less ,
that means that you care a little bit .
all right . i &apos;m going to the hot tub .
if i stay in here one more minute ,
my head is literally gonna explode .
well , i hope not , because if you mean &quot; literally &quot; --
i don &apos;t feel safe in my own home !
phil , honey , i need your help .
with what ?
what is the one thing a speeder can &apos;t outrun ?
ooh . bullets . a laser .
oh , i know -- a falcon ! dad , jump in .
not a good time .
a laser falcon !
that &apos;s awesome .
shame .
&quot; slow down your neighbors &quot; ! ?
no . &quot; slow down &quot; --
talking to the speeder --
who &apos;s talking to the speeder ?
your neighbors .
it doesn &apos;t say that .
yeah , it just says &quot; slow down your neighbors &quot; !
phil .
i know what you were going for ,
but now all i can see is &quot; slow down your neighbors &quot; !
well , you &apos;re all wrong , &apos; cause this is incredibly clear .
and it &apos;s really important .
we need to put these signs up all over the neighborhood .
i don &apos;t know . it seems kind of cowardly .
why don &apos;t you just make an anonymous call to the police ?
i called the police , and they were totally unhelpful .
surprise . surprise .
phil , come on . are you with me or not ?
of course i &apos;m with you .
who else would i be with ? this guy ?
i have no connection to this guy .
good !
no !
fine .
before you judge me ,
i have come in second to gil thorpe
for salesman of the quarter seven quarters in a row .
seven .
nobody remembers second best .
oh , yeah , everybody loves michael jordan ,
but nobody thinks of scottie pippen .
职业生涯与迈克尔 · 乔丹一起拿到六枚总冠军戒指
the only reason i remember him
is because he &apos;s named after my favorite musical .
oh , hey , mitch .
hey . it &apos;s barry .
uh , i just want to let you guys know
you got a sprinkler head that &apos;s leaking out there .
oh . thanks , barry . i &apos;ll let the gardener know .
all right . or maybe i could just wave my hands over it
and heal it that way .
i &apos;m joking .
oh , god . that was a good one .
look , don &apos;t worry about it .
as soon as i started talking about reiki ,
i could tell you thought i might be a little nutty .
was i that obvious ?
you roll your eyes a lot .
uh , no , it &apos;s true .
it &apos;s true , no .
i @-@ i once saw a picture of myself
at a friend &apos;s poetry slam ,
and all you could see were the whites of my eyes .
yeah , i looked like little orphan annie .
the cartoon .
anyway , i &apos;m sorry if i offended you .
no . don &apos;t apologize .
look , i -- only thing that offends me
is a man who doesn &apos;t live in his own truth .
and i appreciate how hard you &apos;re trying
not to roll your eyes right now .
&apos;cause i &apos;m about to pass out !
i see it .
okay ! i &apos;m ready !
what the hell &apos;s he wearing ?
protection pads . he needs more ?
we &apos;re riding bikes . we &apos;re not training police dogs .
all right , kid . come on . get on .
on board .
attaboy .
all right , we ready ?
ride !
be careful , papi .
ignore her .
i &apos;ve seen the kid fall down
on that moving sidewalk at the airport ,
so i didn &apos;t have high hopes .
but what do you know ? the kid was a natural .
mom ! it &apos;s so easy !
bravo , manny !
i told you !
be careful with the bump !
hey , wait a minute . who &apos;s that guy ?
jay , he &apos;s gonna grab him !
oh , no one &apos;s grabbing anyone . it &apos;s a neighbor .
gloria , on the other hand ,
was a natural disaster .
there are three things you want to do before you ride .
manny .
check your shoelaces , adjust your mirror ,
and test your bell .
okay . shoelaces tied ...
the mirror is good ...
... the bell is ringing .
okay , now what ?
ride .
ay , no , no , no , jay .
don &apos;t push me ! i don &apos;t want to get hurt !
trust me . i &apos;m not gonna hurt you .
you &apos;re a work of art .
if you get scratched ,
the value goes down .
i &apos;m making a joke to lighten the mood .
it &apos;s not working !
let &apos;s just do this .
okay .
slowly .
jay , slowly .
relax . you &apos;re not gonna fall .
i got you . put your feet on the pedals .
now look where you &apos;re going .
look where you &apos;re going !
no , i &apos;m falling . i &apos;m falling .
look straight ahead . go , go , go .
pedal !
no , jay !
what are you ringing the bell for ?
ay ! why you let me go , jay ? !
no , no ! pedal !
look where you &apos;re going ! look where you &apos;re going !
i &apos;m gonna kill you , jay !
okay . good day &apos;s work .
what do you say we hit the jewelry store ?
phil ?
laura !
what are you doing ?
taking this ... sign down !
i recognized your license plate .
this is ridiculous !
i know . they &apos;re all over the neighborhood .
what kind of lunatic does something like this ?
who knows ?
it &apos;s probably some bored housewife
who hates her husband and hates her life ,
so she takes it out on the rest of us !
or things are so good at home ,
she &apos;s out looking for problems .
trust me .
this woman needs to get laid .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the issue .
here . stick this up .
send her a message from me .
okay .
oh , my gosh .
what happened to my sign ?
i don &apos;t know !
i put it up , i went away ,
i came back -- it was in pieces !
this is so crazy .
crazy ! !
claire , this whole thing is crazy .
maybe we should back off a little bit .
you know what , phil ? no .
i am not gonna back off .
okay ? i am doing this for the safety of our neighborhood .
well , what &apos;s going on here ?
hey , cam .
just getting rid of some negative energy .
oh , well , in that case , we &apos;ll be back tuesday .
you &apos;re all set , mitch .
barry .
oh , man , that was -- that was great . - yeah ?
namaste , man .
namaste .
namaste .
all right . i &apos;m gonna get out of your hair .
i &apos;m gonna grab a quick tub
and see if i can rustle up some food .
oh , no . hey , don &apos;t rustle .
we &apos;re making dinner tonight . you &apos;re coming .
yeah , come down .
yeah ?
yes .
thank you , mitch .
see ? it &apos;s working already .
namaste .
what ?
you know what i &apos;m looking for .
he &apos;s a very nice guy .
that &apos;s not it .
i &apos;m sorry i made a snap judgment .
still not it .
you were right .
there she is .
hello , mitchell .
oh . mrs. ko . i &apos;m cameron .
mitchell &apos;s the other one .
what are you doing here ?
i just finished showing the apartment upstairs .
what do you mean ? what about barry ?
who &apos;s barry ?
the new tenant .
nobody living up there . it &apos;s empty .
but ...
you see anybody up there , you call me .
my husband .
i &apos;m coming !
you two so lucky they don &apos;t let you get married .
the problem wasn &apos;t me .
it was jay . he &apos;s a very bad teacher .
very bossy .
i don &apos;t respond to that .
i need somebody gentle , nurturing ,
like a woman .
hey . gloria . what &apos;s up ?
can you teach me how to ride a bike ?
you can &apos;t ride a bike ?
i love that about you .
i was beginning to think you didn &apos;t have any flaws .
listen , i wish i could ,
but i &apos;m late for an open house .
i could teach you .
really ?
sure .
i &apos;m a great bike rider .
i &apos;ve taught a bunch of my friends .
i never taught anyone anything .
but my playdate canceled , so i was wide open .
barry ?
yep !
oh . hey , cameron .
what are you doing in there ?
i &apos;m just tidying up a little bit .
what &apos;s up ?
are you living in our daughter &apos;s princess castle ? !
what ? !
no , don &apos;t be ridiculous .
i &apos;m living in here , man .
i &apos;m sleeping in there .
you said you had just moved in upstairs .
no , i said i just moved in .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . i thought it was implied ...
that you &apos;re living in a dollhouse ?
okay . let &apos;s not do this outside .
all right ?
you want to go inside
and talk about this like two adults ?
yes . let &apos;s do that .
great .
no --
no !
it &apos;s okay . i just cleaned up .
come on in .
oh , my god ! you are living in here !
inside voices .
barry .
are you homeless ?
homeless ?
are you insane ?
look at this place.i mean ...
okay . i can &apos;t even believe i &apos;m having to say this ,
but you can &apos;t -- you can &apos;t stay here .
oh , boy .
this is about the --
the body work i did with mitchell , isn &apos;t it ?
&apos;cause i would understand if that was ...
bothering you .
no . you are living in a little girl &apos;s toy ,
and you have to move out .
okay , well , this is gonna make dinner really awkward .
there &apos;s no dinner ! dinner is off !
okay ? now , come on . let &apos;s go .
no , no , no . don &apos;t touch me . i don &apos;t like to be touched .
you &apos;re a massage therapist .
i &apos;m a reiki master . very little touching .
okay , barry . listen to me .
okay .
you &apos;re a very nice man .
mitchell and i like you very much .
thank you .
but i &apos;m -- you &apos;re welcome .
i &apos;m going to take your hand ...
yes , i am .
don &apos;t give me the coyote look . i &apos;m not a canine .
we &apos;re gonna walk out of here together .
nobody &apos;s gonna hurt you .
oh , this is not gonna end very well .
give me your hand .
cam ? !
mitchell ! call 911 !
what &apos;s happening ? !
barry &apos;s a nut !
he &apos;s been living in lily &apos;s castle !
what ?
hey , mitchell !
oh , my god ! i thought he was living upstairs !
just call the police !
do you want me to stop and give you the whole story ? !
i never -- i never said upstairs .
mitchell !
call 911 ! stop pinching !
okay . and just for the record ,
i was right !
i still don &apos;t think you should judge people !
i said get off me !
okay , gloria .
what scares you about riding a bike ?
losing control and falling down .
great . what else ?
somebody grabbing me ?
that &apos;s weird . what else ?
looking foolish .
okay .
see , all these bad thoughts are holding you back .
so how do we get rid of these bad thoughts ?
we shoot &apos; em out !
no , don &apos;t you dare !
ride !
don &apos;t you dare !

see you later .
how &apos;s it going ?
hey , great . lots of people .
listen , i was thinking about those signs .
&quot; slow down your neighbors &quot; !
oh , actually , i think they meant
&quot; slow down &quot; -- talking to you --
who &apos;s talking ? &quot; your neighbors . &quot;
anyway ...
yeah , um , you think maybe it &apos;s possible
that you do drive a little too fast
in a residential neighborhood
with children present , maybe , or ...
oh , phil , i appreciate your concern ,
but i am not the problem .
it &apos;s the crazy sign lady
who can &apos;t put a sentence together --
that &apos;s your problem .
phil ? honey ?
claire ?
ohh . god .
i had to get some water .
i was chasing that crazy maniac .
i got so close .
and you just gave up ?
that &apos;s not the claire that i know .

phil , i left my phone at the drugstore .
i &apos;ll be right back .

hey , are you going by greenleaf ?
actually , yeah .
i just overdid it on my bike ,
and i cannot get back on there .

that &apos;s a terrible idea .
why ?
why ?
i wish i were one of those people
who thrives on the danger of leading a double life .
you know , bruce wayne ,
peter parker ,
hannah montana .
that &apos;s a terrible ... idea ,
because your bike is here .
what are you gonna do ? leave it ? that &apos;s rude !
oh , just pick it up whenever .
whenever ? ! what &apos;s &quot; whenever &quot; ?
that &apos;s so open @-@ ended .
oh , stop it .
come on , claire . let &apos;s fly .
ahh . i love her energy .
i &apos;m coming !
so , why do you want to move ?
ah , i want a high @-@ rise with a doorman .
besides , this neighborhood is getting a little crazy .
oh , tell me about it .
there &apos;s this one whack job ...
you know , don &apos;t say another word .
i bet i know exactly who you &apos;re thinking of .
claire was furious .
she said i betrayed her on every level .
so , i called the florist ,
and i have ordered one dozen mylar balloons .
good luck staying mad , honey .
come on , which civilization invent the alphabet
i don &apos;t know .
