and heels down .
this hurts .
pain is only in the mind .
right leg up , and flip your dog .
it feels like my leg .
back to downward dog .
my mind has a cramp .
you know the guy that keeps smiling at you -- jorge ?
he just broke up with his girlfriend .
really ?
mm @-@ hmm . double date tomorrow night .
no !
shh ! shh ! shh ! shh !
sorry .
what does he do ?
medicine .
shh !
oh , all right .
rizzoli .
okay .
mindful awareness
is what can subdue the primitive consciousness
and bring the physical body under control of the will .
i totally agree .
i have to go .
yeah , you can &apos;t leave before savasana .
corpse pose .
maura , let &apos;s go .
thank you .
namaste .
come on !
you got her to do yoga .
no , it was my idea . i love yoga .
we had to leave before ardha chandrasana .
i feel very unbalanced .
she was dragged here .
oh , that &apos;s all been photographed and inventoried .
gaynor @-@ randle . 32 .
atm $ 100 . scratch robbery .
did you find what was used to beat her ?
not yet .
vintage . she had a flair for clothes .
hm , she was sexually assaulted .
reddish @-@ brown stains on the inner thighs and external genitalia .
i hear an echo .
she was married .
pager &apos;s totaled .
it &apos;s not a pager .
it &apos;s a glucose @-@ management system -- insulin pump .
she was diabetic .
yep . needle sticks .
she probably had to check her glucose level
about 5 to 10 times a day .
maybe this .
yeah , she kept careful records .
her last glucose @-@ level reading was over 400 .
is that good or bad ?
it &apos;s extremely high .
is that good or bad ?
bad . she wasn &apos;t getting any insulin .
she probably had slurred speech , trouble walking .
that explains why there &apos;s no defensive wounds .
she couldn &apos;t fight back .
murder weapon has a rectangular edge on it .
i can &apos;t confirm that .
hey , frost , we &apos;re looking for a 2x4 --
frost , we &apos;re looking for an idiot .
that your way of saying you want to talk to the husband ?
what &apos;s it say about relationships
that the husband or the boyfriend &apos;s our first suspect ?
are you getting ready for an &quot; i hate men &quot; speech ?
i like men , just ... not the ones that kill .
jane .
it may not be the husband .
because she didn &apos;t have a husband .
we &apos;re sorry for your loss , mrs. randle .
i prefer &quot; mel . &quot;
and it &apos;s gaynor @-@ randle .
we took each other &apos;s names .
the commonwealth recognizes our marriage .
i have a right to know who did this .
of course you do . we want to know , too .
when was the last time you spoke to her ?
5 o &apos;clock , maybe ?
did she always work late ?
always ... on my night out .
i &apos;m the , uh , captain of the lgbt bowling league .
lesbian @-@ gay- bisexual @-@ transgender .
uh , what time did you get home ?
about 10 o &apos;clock .
i called katie &apos;s office , her cell .
by midnight , i was calling the e.r.
and you guys over and over again .
you can check with my alarm company , my cell records ...
... the bowling alley .
we will have to verify your whereabouts .
understood .
i suppose it &apos;s always the first suspect .
i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s okay .
oh , come on . it &apos;s not like she has to worry about the scar .
don &apos;t rush me .
well , multitask , then . time of death ?
the core temperature i took hepatically was 88.4 degrees .
killed between 2 : 00 and 3 : 00 a.m.
jorge say anything about me ?
yoga jorge ?
no , jaunty lube jorge .
oil change ? i don &apos;t go there .
total rip off .
maura , come on . what &apos;d he say about me ?
he said , &quot; sure . &quot; when brock asked about having a double date .
no , i &apos;m not going .
oh , jane .
what about dna substance from the sexual assault ?
no semen , but i did collect some deerskin fibers .
so we &apos;re looking for bambi .
no , deerskin from apparel .
w-- moccasins , a tepee ?
no , tepees are generally constructed from buffalo hides .
w-- wow you are so literal .
but deerskin actually has great tactility .
small pores make it soft , tough --
work gloves .
so no prints .
oh !
what ?
jorge thinks you &apos;re hot .
forget it .
come on , jane . listen to me .
every time he looks at you ,
he contracts his orbicularis oculi and pars orbitalis .
gross .
it &apos;s facial muscles . please .
only if you tell me what killed her .
there should be more blood associated with her facial lacerations .
i &apos;m gonna have so much fun on my couch , alone .
and it looks like the assault and the rape happened post @-@ mortem .
what , she was raped and beaten after she was killed ?
so what killed her ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
well , i don &apos;t know when i &apos;m gonna have time for dinner .
an adrenaline response to panic overstressed her heart ,
which was already compromised by diabetes .
so , why rape and beat her once she was dead ?
look at this .
&quot; merch . &quot;
means &quot; girl &quot; in welsh .
since when do lawyers have club stamps ?
yeah , she came in monday nights like clockwork .
she was here last night .
did you see her leave ?
it was packed .
did you see her , uh , with -- with her wife ?
no , but she talked about her .
i mean , it seemed like a -- like a good relationship .
as far as marriages go .
yeah . we have that in common .
rob was here last night . he worked the door .
last name ?
thatcher . it &apos;s not him , though .
i checked him out before i hired him .
he &apos;s clean enough to squeak .
detective rizzoli . this is detective frost .
you know her ?
this the dead chick ?
yeah .
i heard about it on the radio .
yeah , she slid up in here right before happy hour ended .
drinks go up after 7 : 00 .
did you see her with anybody ?
we have a lot of good @-@ looking ladies here .
did you see her leave ?
no . sorry .
god , i hate this .
if she &apos;d just gone someplace else ,
she &apos;d still be alive .
why ? cause it &apos;s a lesbian bar ?
yeah .
i didn &apos;t take these psychos seriously .
it &apos;s massachusetts . same @-@ sex marriage is legal here .
can we take this ?
yeah , it &apos;s yours .
thanks a lot .
if you think of anything ...
all right .
escalating threats .
desecration of katie &apos;s body .
looks to me like we got ourselves a hate crime .
uh , &quot; sons and daughters of adam . &quot;
that &apos;s your catchphrase , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m offended to see sacred words
associated with pornography .
how about associated with murder ?
i @-@ i think it &apos;s interesting
that they sent a female and an african @-@ american
to interview me about a homosexual murder .
you don &apos;t like women or african @-@ americans either ?
well , i have a right to my opinion .
only if you don &apos;t enforce it with a 2x4 .
we &apos;re gonna need to see a list of your members .
oh , surely . i came prepared .
those are all members ?
we &apos;re national .
satan is using homosexuals to destroy the kingdom of god .
be on the lookout for a man in a red cape
with a tail and pointy ears .
i will pray for you .
no , thank you . i &apos;ll do it myself .
and , so , this drunk , with a knife ,
is outrunning my old partner , korsak .
he finally catches up to him .
he grabs him by the shorts -- true story --
and ... they rip right off .
please tell me he &apos;s wearing underwear .
no . no , he &apos;s not .
no .
no .
so , that was my first week on the job .
i got to tackle a naked guy .
nice .
yeah .
i think that sounds like fun .
anyone for some , uh , dessert , some coffee ?
actually , it -- it &apos;s getting kind of late .
you know , i think i need to use the ladies &apos; room .
oh . jane ?
hmm ?
will you join me ?
no , no , no . i don &apos;t need to go .
i think you do .
i need to go to the ladies &apos; room ,
if you &apos;ll excuse me .
please .
what are you--
oh !
shh ! come on .
i thought you needed to go to the restroom !
that was a ruse . well , do you like him ?
he &apos;s sexy .
mm , yeah , i think you should take him home .
maura .
what ? you said he was sexy .
well , just because i like the way he looks in yoga class
doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m gonna like the way he looks in my bed .
right .
but did you know that sex releases immunoglobulin &quot; a &quot; ?
it wards off colds .
no . not tonight .
a @-@ and i didn &apos;t shave my legs .
nice try .
what kind of person are you ?
you &apos;re like a racecar ...
finely tuned ... beautiful ...
fast ...
i &apos;m not that fast .
hey ! wow , look at you .
aw , i should take her for a walk .
hm ? okay .
let &apos;s take her for a walk . come here , little boo @-@ boo .
come on . okay .
uh , maura said that you &apos;re in medicine .
are you a doctor ?
no .
uh ... e.m.t. ?
nurse .
a male nurse . that is so cool .
you should get the biodegradable ones .
right .
uh , so , what happened between you and your girlfriend ?
oh , we didn &apos;t agree about kids .
oh , she wanted them , you didn &apos;t ?
no .
i just love the idea of being a stay @-@ at @-@ home daddy .
but she wanted to stay home , too .
someone &apos;s got to work , right ?
yeah . wow . i &apos;m surprised .
why ? because i &apos;m hispanic ?
it &apos;s a new world .
see , i am looking for a really strong woman .
someone who knows how to hold warrior , too .
like you .
come on . let &apos;s go . come on .
coming ?
yeah .
okay .
let &apos;s go for our walkie @-@ kins . so much fun !
really ?
that bad ?
i thought you said you couldn &apos;t lie .
what do you mean ? i can &apos;t .
you did .
only one time ,
when i said i &apos;d finished my homework and i hadn &apos;t ,
and i immediately went vasovagal .
fainted .
jorge &apos;s in &quot; medicine &quot; ?
technically , yes , he is .
what &apos;s his specialty ? lactation ?
orthopedics .
joe grant was a detective , he was sexy ,
and he was a perfect match for you .
well , i kind of liked him .
yeah , well , you butted heads with him
until he moved to washington .
so you hooked me up with nurse jorge .
wh-- i -- i just -- yes .
it &apos;s not funny .
hey . anything come up on those background checks ?
still waiting on that , uh , bouncer from the club ,
and no red flags on anybody here .
somebody &apos;s got a boyfriend .
someone should mind his own business .
what -- no .
your eyes are like pools of midnight !
no ! come on .
what ? what ?
your @-@ r @-@ r lips are like ... tempur @-@ pedic pillows .
really ? just give this .
&quot; dinner . saturday .
i &apos;m already in the kitchen . jorge . &quot;
sounds kind of sissy to me .
hey , guy cooks .
yeah , i know .
it &apos;s a match .
excuse me ?
the bouncer .
&quot; robert thatcher &quot; -- it &apos;s an alias .
real name is &quot; roy tompkins . &quot;
so , that &apos;s why he lied . look at this .
outstanding warrant -- new york city
for criminal sexual assault .
come on .
hey , roy . we need to talk to you .
oh . i wouldn &apos;t do that , roy .
been holdin &apos; out on me , bruce lee !
we can do this all day , roy .
what happened to katie ?
look , i can &apos;t tell you what i don &apos;t know !
what is so important ?
jorge dropped off lunch for you .
that &apos;s not why i interrupted you .
i extracted the killer &apos;s dna from the murder weapon .
who is he ?
well , there was no match in codis , but it &apos;s not a &quot; he . &quot;
it &apos;s a &quot; she . &quot;
the killer &apos;s a woman ?
the deerskin fibers are lifted from the murder weapon .
were off the killer &apos;s glove ?
seams were breached ,
and dna tests confirmed that the sweat was from a female .
yeah , we already know that ,
and a male accomplice raped her .
no , injuries are consistent with
a non @-@ biological phallus @-@ shaped object .
you mean a dildo ?
yes , i believe that is the popular term for it .
but did you know that a 28,000 @-@ year @-@ old stone phallus
was recently found in a german cave ?
ice @-@ age men were using it for knapping flints .
yeah , ice @-@ age women were using it for making sparks , too .
yeah , okay .
so , if she wasn &apos;t raped , it &apos;s probably not a hate crime .
it wasn &apos;t a robbery .
i &apos;m beginning to think this was personal .
i wonder if jorge read the chump study .
chump study . probably wrote it .
chocolate happiness undergoing more pleasantness study .
yeah , i @-@ it actually concluded
that chocolate makes us happier .
chocolate from jorge makes me sadder .
flowers .
flowers have been shown to reduce depression .
come on , jane . jorge &apos;s a catch .
if you don &apos;t want &apos; em , can i have &apos; em ?
jorge ? yeah , he &apos;s all yours .
maybe if i get fat , he &apos;ll stop calling .
i just think if you allow him
to see all sides of you ,
then he &apos;ll stop calling .
you know what ?
i just heard what that sounded like , and that is --
what i meant to say was that ...
human beings have good and bad traits , you know ,
a @-@ and you have , you know ...
some characteristics that are a little ...
n @-@ not as , um --
wow , fudge clusters .
katie was deleting her ...
search history on her computer .
why ? what was she hiding ?
have we checked the wife &apos;s alibi ?
solid .
tracked all her calls -- e.r. , 911 .
alarm company confirms she activated her home alarm
at 10 : 03 p.m. ,
didn &apos;t break the circuit again till 6 : 17 a.m.
she didn &apos;t do it .
how do you know ?
got mel &apos;s scorecard from the night of the murder .
she &apos;s a hell of a bowler .
she had a turkey .
why would she do that ?
that &apos;s three strikes in a row , maura .
oh . wish i could get her for our team .
but you got to be divorced .
can you try to restore all that history that kate deleted ?
let &apos;s give it a shot .
really yummy .
sorted by popularity .
hmm , spent a lot of time on cupid4girls.com ...
lipstidate.com.
online hook @-@ up services .
so , katie was cheating on her wife .
somebody posted a message for her the day she was killed .
&quot; liked our time at the merch . want to play again ? &quot;
our vic was having more than a drink after work .
can you trace the i.p. addresses ?
smart .
what ?
they set up the website to hide all i.p. addresses --
protects their customers .
yeah , and hides the cheaters .
why work so hard to get the right to marry --
to do the same thing that straight couples do ?
i don &apos;t know .
hey , korsak .
they kind of ...
resemble each other .
jane and the victim .
you &apos;re right . be a shame to waste an opportunity like that .
no .
we could ...
no way .
we could try and bait a trap .
post the same kind of message katie did ,
attract the same kind of woman .
arrange dates , get dna ,
see if we get a match .
how ? we stick a fork in &apos; em ?
you buy her a drink ,
you take the glass .
club owner seemed like she &apos;d cooperate .
jane could ... possibly ... wear a wire .
no .
no , i &apos;m not gonna go undercover
to troll for lesbian dates
on the random chance that we catch a killer , no .
i think she loves the idea .
me too .
why do they do this ?
the categories are such stereotypes .
&quot; femme , &quot; &quot; boy next door , &quot;
&quot; sporty , &quot; or &quot; fine . &quot;
jane &apos;s definitely &quot; fine . &quot;
i &apos;m just saying , for the purposes of the ad ,
you know , to draw the best response .
yeah . right .
okay , i @-@ i j @-@ just have to check a box ,
so , &quot; femme , &quot; &quot; butch , &quot;
&quot; lipstick , &quot; &quot; chapstick , &quot;
&quot; sporty . &quot;
i &apos;ve seen her break a chair
over the head of a meth @-@ crazed gangbanger .
so ... &quot; butch &quot; ?
yeah .
i mean , she took him out .
no . no , no , no , no .
she &apos;s -- no , no . she &apos;s my friend .
i @-@ i &apos;m not putting &quot; butch . &quot;
she &apos;s -- i &apos;m putting &quot; sporty . &quot;
just check what the victim checked , huh ?
oh . let &apos;s see . &quot; lipstick lesbian . &quot;
i love undercover .
&quot; nice and supportive &quot; doesn &apos;t mean weak .
please .
jorge ...
is more submissive than my dog .
aww , yes , he is ! aww !
maybe i should be a lesbian .
aww , well , wishes can come true .
frost and korsak wanted to fill out your dating profile .
i typed .
you what ?
if it wasn &apos;t for me , you &apos;d be &quot; butch . &quot;
y-- you put my photo and profile on a gay @-@ dating website ?
it &apos;s your best shot at getting dna and breaking this case .
no , it &apos;s our best shot .
you &apos;re going with me .
no .
yes , dr. isles .
w-- i don &apos;t have time to train a female detective
how to collect and preserve dna .
w-- you &apos;re going .
there . look .
all these women think you &apos;re hot .
you realize one of these women
could be katie &apos;s killer .
and not this one . listen .
she likes to hike , has season tickets to the celtics .
what ?
front row ? oh , i might flip for that .
i don &apos;t understand online dating .
people reveal too much about themselves .
&quot; i want to connect with someone
who can make me more of who i am . &quot;
... &quot; who can be strong without needing me to be weak . &quot;
i wonder what kind of women we would like
if we liked women .
what ? !
well , um , first of all , i would be the guy .
that &apos;s a cliche . why would you be the guy ?
because .
because you &apos;re bossy ?
so are you .
no , i &apos;m not .
yes , you are .
you &apos;re just soft and polite
when you &apos;re bossing people around .
well , it &apos;s a good thing you &apos;re not my type .
what do you mean i &apos;m not your type ?
that is so rude .
well , you don &apos;t know how to relax .
and you wear your shoes and your clothes to bed ,
and you just admitted that you &apos;re bossy .
okay , yeah . i &apos;m bossy . right .
you put my picture and profile on a gay @-@ dating website ,
and i &apos;m bossy .
right . okay .
after i said no , by the way .
what are you doing ?
meditating . it &apos;s too stressful to argue with you .
well , just think --
because of you , by this time tomorrow ,
i could be on a date with a killer .
yaaay .
it &apos;s okay , buddy . it &apos;s just me .
what are you doing here ?
i guess i fell asleep while i was meditating .
well , at least you don &apos;t snore .
oh , well , you kick .
no , no , no . that &apos;s not me .
that was jo . she runs in her sleep .
myoclonic contractions .
dogs have dog dreams .
maybe we should take a look and see if --
if anybody else signed up to hook into you .
that &apos;s not how you say it . it &apos;s &quot; hook up with you . &quot;
whatever .
&quot; whatever &quot; ? i &apos;m the one hooking up .
well , pretending to .
that &apos;s easy for you to say .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m actually hoping
that the killer wants to meet me .
damn it . jorge .
jorge , jorge , jorge ...
jorge .
oh , in case i missed his first e @-@ mail ...
and his 10th -- jorge .
he &apos;s so nice .
god .
maybe that &apos;s what you need .
you need somebody ... loving and supportive .
like a hamster .
jane .
what ?
well , i mean , y-- what you think of as a &quot; great guy &quot;
is an average woman .
you know , i mean ,
if i wanted someone to walk the dog with me
and talk about my feelings , i &apos;d be gay .
you &apos;re not gonna say that to him , are you ?
i will if you don &apos;t .
you got me into this , so get me out of it .
please .
what ?
now i understand why you always look like this .
excuse me ?
you have nothing to wear .
this is completely appropriate .
mm . you know , i @-@ it &apos;s perfect .
where exactly am i going to hide the camera and the wire ?
i know -- in my thong .
well , maybe you could wear a brief .
no .
mark twain said , &quot; the clothes make the man . &quot;
he also said , &quot; naked people have little or no influence . &quot;
this is very serious .
maura , come on . i @-@ it &apos;ll be fine , all right ?
w @-@ we &apos;re trained professionals . we know what we &apos;re doing .
we &apos;ve actually been undercover a few times before ,
so , um ... let me handle this .
okay . it &apos;s fine . you don &apos;t want my help .
it &apos;s like trying to dress a squirmy 6 @-@ year @-@ old , anyway .
everything &apos;s too short , too itchy .
&quot; i can &apos;t walk in that . &quot;
maura , we all love the fact that you dress
like you &apos;re about to strut down a paris runway .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s ... interesting .
it &apos;s endearing .
sexy .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s fashionable .
oh , so -- so that &apos;s what you think ?
you think this is all about fashion for me ?
this is gonna be good .
no ? i @-@ i @-@ it &apos;s not about fashion ?
no , it &apos;s not .
what is it about , then ?
i used to sit at the musée d &apos;orsay for hours
and just stare at it .
do you know what i mean ?
yes , the rizzoli family vacations there every summer .
have you ever tried to appreciate ...
euler &apos;s number &quot; e &quot;
you know , the beautiful equation
that connects three constants of mathematics ?
have you ?
yeah , i tried it once .
i am in awe of what human beings can do .
i am in awe of the hand @-@ knit channel stitching
on this sweater .
i am in awe of the artisan
who molded and shaped this shoe .
i cannot wait to see what you &apos;re gonna wear .
there &apos;s a back room that way . just ...
why don &apos;t we do it right here ? yeah ?
guys must eat you up .
why ? why do you say that ?
because you &apos;re just like them .
beautiful ... dominant energy .
if you ever feel like getting adventurous ...
i &apos;ll give you a call .
dr. isles is ...
... not very doctorly .
i mean ... at all .
your table &apos;s ready , miss .
oh , my god . put this on .
no . i &apos;m undercover . follow me .
oh , my god .
i &apos;ll be right back with your drink .
thank you .
there she goes . first date .
i finally work up the nerve , you know , and call them .
i get the machine .
so i go , &quot; mom , dad ...
i &apos;m gay ! &quot;
how &apos;d you do it ?
i ...
ladies , may i get you something to drink ?
no . we &apos;re good .
may i take that for you ?
we &apos;re good , right , miranda ?
my real name &apos;s mary anne .
&quot; hi , mom , dad . i &apos;m gay . &quot;
whatever happened to &quot; call me back &quot; ?
i mean , you leave your most personal information
on an answering machine .
a friend of mine asked for a divorce by texting .
no manners anymore .
yeah , you had it down .
so much more polite to serve divorce papers .
i always fall for girls like you .
like what ?
oh , smart , tough ...
... complicated .
mm , my hands are sore from ... volleyball .
you &apos;re gonna break my heart .
they get right into it .
all they talk about are their feelings .
they &apos;re women .
oh , and you &apos;re -- you &apos;re an expert ?
i been married 20 years .
to three different women .
so ?
so , that &apos;s not a very good track record , detective .
yeah , look where you &apos;re spending your friday night , romeo .
oh , real ladies &apos; man .
rizzoli &apos;s good at this .
at what ? being a lesbian ?
yeah .
no ! shut up . i &apos;m listening .
no , you &apos;re not . you &apos;re talking .
oh , my god !
i like tall brunettes .
i &apos;m jane .
i know . i saw your profile .
i &apos;m claire .
uh , can i get you another drink ?
no , i &apos;ve had enough to get brave .
the next stage is &quot; weepy . &quot;
that &apos;s okay . i don &apos;t mind .
she is creeping me out .
rizzoli ?
no , the other one .
this is gonna freak you out ,
but you kind of look like that girl who was killed .
katie ... somebody .
did you see her picture in the paper ?
yeah .
yeah , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s so scary , isn &apos;t it , that ...
it could have been any of us .
you want to hear the weirdest part ?
yeah .
i think i was her last date .
really ?
reel her in .
did you tell the police ?
no . no , i don &apos;t know anything .
w @-@ we chatted online , met up here .
we really hit it off . then i saw her ring .
i don &apos;t hook up with married women .
&quot; i don &apos;t hook up with married women &quot; ?
she &apos;s saying she doesn &apos;t cheat .
is that cheating ?
are you serious ?
well , what was she like ?
i really liked her .
she shouldn &apos;t have lied about being married .
and if she hadn &apos;t ...
she might still be alive .
thanks .
none of the allele frequencies correspond
to the dna isolated from the 2x4 .
the blood on the weapon didn &apos;t match any of my dates ?
w-- not even claire ?
no .
hey .
csru went through katie &apos;s papers .
look at this .
hey , our vic inherited half a million dollars
while she was still single .
she keeps it in the event of a divorce ,
but if she dies ...
it all goes to the grieving widow .
hell of a consolation prize .
widow &apos;s got motive .
yeah , but she &apos;s got a titanium alibi .
she can prove she was bowling .
you know , katie was very careful about controlling her diabetes .
i counted nearly 100 needle sticks .
so it just doesn &apos;t make any sense
that she wouldn &apos;t know she needed insulin .
maybe she did . was the pump working ?
it was so compromised , i can &apos;t tell .
what if -- - i don &apos;t like sentences that begin with &quot; what if . &quot;
let &apos;s assume --
why is that better ?
that katie tested herself , her numbers were high ,
she gave herself some insulin --
or what she thought was insulin .
no , b @-@ because i tested the residue in the pump --
pure insulin .
her tox screen came back negative .
no signs of poisons in katie &apos;s body .
unless ... there &apos;s something
that couldn &apos;t be detected in her bloodstream .
if somebody put something in the pump ...
there should be fingerprints on it .
it &apos;s clean . okay .
why aren &apos;t katie &apos;s prints on it , at least ?
someone might have attached it to her body
and wiped it clean .
that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m just guessing .
all right , so , katie &apos;s regular insulin pump
was switched to one full of poison .
she thinks she &apos;s giving herself insulin .
she &apos;s actually killing herself .
who had access to katie ?
mel , the wife
who was at home when katie was being beaten .
she had an accomplice .
mm @-@ hmm .
smart killer , because it &apos;s impossible
to prove without evidence .
which we don &apos;t have .
yet .
katie was here with women ,
so , obviously , she was cheating .
did you know her wife , mel ?
well , i run a bar , not a church .
you know that , right ?
come on .
all right , well , did katie ever mention anything
like she thought mel was seeing someone ?
no , she never did .
sorry .
hmm ?
no , i &apos;m done . thank you .
well , um ...
you have my number ?
yeah , i do .
if you have any new thoughts ...
you know , you said if i was ever feeling adventurous ...
yeah ?
yeah .
i need you to swab my neck for dna .
i &apos;m not even going to ask why .
you have 10 seconds . there is a bus coming at you .
you can either be on it or under it .
that cop is fishing . stay strong .
yeah , i had to stand there and watch katie die .
you know --
hey . shh , shh , shh . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
you weren &apos;t there . she was -- she was so sick .
what did you put in that pump ?
fentanyl . it can &apos;t be detected .
mixed it with water , swapped out the pumps .
what if we screwed up ?
we didn &apos;t .
look , we get the money in 90 days .
i --
shh . it &apos;s okay , baby .
hey , wait . what about the fingerprints ?
you left prints ?
no , that &apos;s what i &apos;m worried about .
katie &apos;s prints should have been on the pump ,
but there were no prints .
wait , how do you know that ?
because she decided to get on the bus .
arms behind your back .
same old story -- kill your wife for the money .
how could you do this ?
this ... is as adventurous as i get .
crap . maura . maura .
hey .
hey !
look , i @-@ i just want to say that i ...
support your choice , jane .
okay .
thank you .
and thank you for the flowers and the chocolates
and ... the lunch .
and the car battery , even though mine was fine .
sure . you &apos;re welcome .
glad we live in a state that women like you can get married
if that &apos;s what you want .
okay .
you told him i was gay .
no , he assumed . it &apos;s different .
okay , let &apos;s begin .
feet shoulder width apart . relax your shoulders .
he assumed ?
just close your eyes and breathe .
and breathe out .
you better hope this calms me down .
well , i could always tell him you like him .
don &apos;t you dare .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t dare .
shhhh !
i &apos;m sorry .
shhhhhh !
i &apos;m sorry .
