hot food from a hot man .
max , a woman in my section wants to know
if we do anything gluten @-@ free .
what do i tell her ?
tell her she &apos;s not allergic to gluten ,
she &apos;s just masking an eating disorder .
look alive , people .
club sandwich , burger , medium ,
and a shrimp salad for the gamblin &apos; man .
i asked for salt and pepper .
i wanted mayonnaise and mustard .
you forgot my diet soda .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ll be right back with--
oh , what ?
never doubt me .
here &apos;s my last check , earl .
look here , max .
that lady just slipped me her number .
like i need another menopausal white woman
scratchin &apos; at my window like a cat in heat .
god , i love money .
i know , i &apos;m so sorry it broke up with you .
look ! this week &apos;s new ipad just came out .
spread the words .
word .
word !
i saw that on the wire .
max , three weeks in a row ,
you have not yet accepted my request to be a facebook friend .
max ? i am talking to you .
i didn &apos;t hear you , i have my earbuds in .
what are these ?
okay , you had to bust a move , and get &quot; the truth &quot; on my ass ?
fine , let &apos;s go there .
han , i &apos;m never gonna be your facebook friend .
woo !
hard to hear .
well , i accepted you , han .
yes , thank you . you make my heart sing .
woo !
hurts me still .
that was like watching someone club a baby seal .
why wouldn &apos;t you just say yes to his friend request ?
because i never check facebook , why would i ?
so some girl i worked at a movie theater with in 2005
can tell me it &apos;s raining and she &apos;s &quot; totes bummed ? &quot;
caroline ! better check facebook page .
maybe someone just post on your wall .
&quot; han lee has tagged you in 25 photos ? &quot;
wanna borrow my seal club yet ?
that stings .
i &apos;ve lost like 300 facebook friends since my father was arrested .
well , your father &apos;s probably made that many new friends in prison ,
so it all evens out .
okay , ready to go ?
do we have to ? it &apos;s so hot outside .
when did heat get so hot ?
stop fighting it , just give in to it .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m quoting a rapist .
can &apos;t we just stay a little bit longer ? we don &apos;t have any a.c. at home .
i have an a.c. you girls can use .
you have an air conditioner that works ?
oh , it works .
that &apos;s like an a.c. that just had salami .
there &apos;s more salami where that came from .
and my feet hurt .
well , you gotta stop wearing those stilts , and get a pair of skechers ,
like normal broke @-@ ass waitresses .
skechers ? how dare you .
besides , i can &apos;t afford new shoes .
these cost $ 900 .
well , then that &apos;s not pain , that &apos;s karma .
look , i will help you out , okay ?
i know a place we can go that has designer things at good prices .
like a barney &apos;s warehouse ?
kind of .
the goodwill ?
welcome to my place !
we &apos;re shopping at the goodwill ?
you led me to believe we were real @-@ shopping .
i know .
i couldn &apos;t wait to see your face when you saw this place .
do the face again .
i love it !
okay , what &apos;s that smell ?
it &apos;s gonna be your smell from now on .
now , pay attention , i know where the good stuff is .
i know where the good stuff is .
madison and 57th .
follow me .
clever bitches hide stuff they want to come back and buy ,
&apos;cause sometimes they don &apos;t have $ 3 to buy it at the time .
who doesn &apos;t have $ 3 ?
you .
last week i hid a dope vintage blazer
in the back of a nightstand , and
here it is !
six bucks , clever bitch . bang , bang !
all right , well , we &apos;re here . i &apos;m gonna make the best of it ,
but first i need a basket without a sno @-@ cone in it .
hey , trish .
not for day @-@ to @-@ day , but at the country club .
you &apos;re kidding , but you &apos;re right .
when you find something , check the pockets for pills .
at a thrift store downtown
i found a purple one once , and took it .
fell asleep for eight hours .
that was my vacation that year .
yay , shoes !
i can &apos;t believe i just said , &quot; yay , &quot; in goodwill .
look , don &apos;t freak . shoes can be funky ,
but i have a special spray at home that makes them like new .
did you get it from a wizard ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god , these brian atwoods were mine .
i donated these to charity ,
&apos;cause i was photographed wearing them twice .
okay , they were $ 800 when i bought them , now they &apos;re $ 8 ?
like me .
i &apos;m $ 8 .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m $ 8 .
i &apos;ve been reduced .
i &apos;m sorry , it just all became so real to me .
i mean , i can &apos;t believe it .
didn &apos;t you see me crying ?
lots of people cry at goodwill .
you go to france , you eat snails . you come here , you cry .
that &apos;s odd , you didn &apos;t even react .
you need to react when people cry .
i did , i rolled my eyes .
look , eventually , you &apos;ll learn to do that on the inside .
okay , well , just fyi ,
when i used to cry in front of my other girlfriends ,
they &apos;d be like , &quot; what you cryin &apos; about , c @-@ line ? &quot;
look at you , girl , you &apos;re fierce , you got your glam on .
are your girlfriends black drag queens ?
oh , awesome strokes tee .
i went to this concert , but i couldn &apos;t afford the shirt .
oh , we &apos;re done with me .
i went to see them on this tour the summer after my junior year .
it was a really warm night , and i snuck out of the house ,
and we all ma-- ahem .
whatever .
and what ?
what , did something great happen the night you got the t ?
look at me , does it look like something great ever happens ?
hey , cute tee . had my eye on it .
i was just bringin &apos; my girl back to see it .
she was in the bathroom .
i had to throw up .
so hand it over .
you know the rule .
turn the back on the rack , you &apos;re under attack .
that &apos;s not me , that &apos;s the law of the &apos; will .
yeah , you better walk away .
that was intense .
just another wednesday at the &apos; will .
you said to look in things , right ?
max , look . on my first try !
ooh , slick . whoever hid those is gonna be pissed .
quality check .
fabric sturdy , no mysterious crotch stains ,
nice work , nancy drew .
and look , they &apos;re designer .
summer 2009 . $ 350 .

$ 5 !
$ 5 , $ 5 , $ 5 , $ 5 ...
hi , maria .
how are you , max ?
i &apos;m good , how &apos;s your mom doin &apos; ?
good . she really appreciated the cupcakes you made her .
hi , maria , i &apos;m caroline , max &apos;s friend .
any way we can get the price down a bit for these ?
i think $ 8 is steep ,
considering their condition .
i happen to know the heel has been replaced .
i cannot believe you &apos;re trying to shoe her down .
i can do $ 6 .
deal .
oh , you happy ? you haggled a charity .
you &apos;re turning goodwill into bad will .
my t @-@ shirt &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s not here .
i bet it was that puerto rican girl ,
who was-- who was eyeing it .
maria , can we call security ?
i &apos;m sure one of the cameras must have captured the theft .
cameras ? what do you think this is , target ?
it &apos;s gone , caroline .
she must have stolen it while i was watching you
do your stupid $ 5 dance .
i didn &apos;t turn my back on the rack , why am i under attack ?
see , this is why i shop alone ,
this is why i eat alone ,
this is why i &apos;m leaving alone .
maria , i &apos;ll pay for these .
you don &apos;t have to box them , you can just use tissue paper .
even as i &apos;m saying this , i know it &apos;s not gonna happen .
hey , chestnut .

only in your version , bugs bunny tries to have a dialogue with the shotgun .
i was trying to get your t @-@ shirt back .
i wanted you to have it ,
because you lit up at the &apos; will when you saw it .
i do not light up , okay ?

that was good money .
thanks for looking out for me , caroline . you &apos;re welcome , max .
