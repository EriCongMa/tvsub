reddington &apos;s missing .
samar , i need you to trace his location .
the search traced mr. reddington &apos;s burner
to a location in west virginia .
you knew where they were . you didn &apos;t tell me .
i want you gone by the end of the day .
my father died for his principles .
it was a trap , set by the crookedest cop of all .
tommy markin .
tommy markin .
i found karakurt .
karakurt &apos;s willing to confess ?
to all of it .
agent keen tells me you have karakurt .
yes . and i intend on turning him over as soon as possible .
don &apos;t . i have a better idea .
hasaan is all yours .
you will have your meeting .
i &apos;ll be in touch when i &apos;m ready .
we have to give him the care package .
we need it to clear your name .
elizabeth , no !
elizabeth keen , you &apos;re under arrest .
just so you know ,
i &apos;m not ashamed of what i did .
you shot the attorney general of the united states .
he was a terrorist .
he was unarmed .
well , i &apos;m glad you have your convictions .
i just don &apos;t wanna die for them .
you said she &apos;d never be caught .
i &apos;ll arrange her transfer to c.i.a. custody .
it won &apos;t be that easy .
we haven &apos;t put safety measures in place .
wait , laurel . laurel .
you said you took care of the reven wright situation .
i did , but certain protocols were set to activate
upon keen &apos;s arrest .
what kind of protocols ?
cynthia panabaker kind .
yeah . she &apos;s white house counsel , and a real pain in the ass .
she &apos;s drafted an executive order mandating keen &apos;s transport
to the federal courthouse for a closed hearing with judge trotter .
how much time do we have ?
three hours , maybe less , peter .
if she tells her story in open court , then --
she won &apos;t .
you know , this entire airport novel started
when you overplayed your hand with raymond reddington .
it &apos;s time for you to close the book on elizabeth keen .
permanently .
three hours to make one woman go away ?
we &apos;ve collapsed entire governments in less time .
第三季第九集
第24号
ressler .
where is she ?
you don &apos;t have to worry about keen &apos;s safety .
i &apos;ve taken measures to -- - your measures will fail .
mine won &apos;t .
oh , so now you &apos;re gonna share your plan with me
now that i &apos;ve arrested your partner in crime ?
face it , reddington . i beat you .
there are no beatings here , donald .
no winners or losers . there is only agent keen &apos;s life .
i have been working on a meticulous campaign
to clear her name .
but i need a day to put one final piece in place .
go for it . you know where we &apos;ll be .
i wish that were true .
but you &apos;re about to witness the full force
of a shadow government working in concert to crush you .
and now that they know you have elizabeth ,
they will stop at nothing to steal her .
you and agents navabi and mojtabai
must remain by her side and guard her with your lives
until you hear from me again .
thanks to you ,
navabi &apos;s no longer a member of this task force .
then it &apos;s all on you , donald .
keep them away from agent keen .
and , donald ,
i assume you have dembe and are being hospitable .
you &apos;ll get a fair hearing .
you and i both know i &apos;m never making it to that hearing alive .
i mean , this place should be safe .
you know , there &apos;s -- - yep .
perfect place to sneak away and be alone .
what &apos;s that for ? i &apos;m cooperating .
well , i cut into your chest with an old bean can , my friend .
so i &apos;m not giving you the chance to return the favor .
you got anything to eat around here ? i &apos;m starving .
i &apos;m sure charlene knows her way around the kitchen .
really , harold ? we gonna do this right now ?
i &apos;m driving you to your sister &apos;s .
it &apos;s not safe around here .
i wanna get you away from karakurt .
the cabal will stop at nothing to kill him .
stay here . guard the asset .
i &apos;ll get back as soon as i can .
beans ?
agent mojtabai .
have you heard about agent keen ?
mr. reddington .
listen to me , aram .
the cabal will come for her .
if they reach her , it &apos;ll be the last time
you ever see elizabeth again .
at this point , only one person can keep her alive . you .
me ? um ... o @-@ okay .
how ?
excellent work , agent ressler .
3 : 00 p.m. , u.s. marshals will arrive
to escort you to a federal courthouse
where you &apos;ll be held pending your arraignment tomorrow .
whatever happens , i don &apos;t blame you .
until that time you &apos;ll be held here
under the authority and protection of reven wright .
i &apos;ll keep you safe . i promise .
i &apos;ve called her four times .
how is it possible that you haven &apos;t gotten in touch with her ?
listen , when you do ,
i want you to get her to call me as soon as possible , understand ?
take him to holding .
hi , dembe .
nobody &apos;s heard from reven wright since last night .
i don &apos;t like this .
you promised me that agent keen would receive a fair hearing .
something &apos;s wrong .
excuse me .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
oh , agent ressler .
congratulations on your arrest .
we &apos;re moving your prisoner .
you don &apos;t have the authority .
homeland has actionable intel from inside russian borders
that a terrorist attack on u.s. soil is imminent .
keen is a russian agent . we need to question her .
i &apos;d like to see a copy of that intel .
well , i &apos;m afraid you are not cleared .
you know reven wright will never allow this .
by the way , where is mrs. wright ?
i haven &apos;t seen or heard from her all day .
excuse me .
i won &apos;t give you the codes .
oh , you don &apos;t need to .
the f.b.i. director can be very helpful
during acts of war .
almost as if we are all on the same team .
you changed the code .
no .
find a way into this box .
agent ressler . how &apos;s our girl ?
you were right . i can &apos;t protect her .
slow down and tell me what &apos;s happening .
look , i can &apos;t move keen to the courthouse for another two hours ,
but the director &apos;s here with his own transfer order .
it &apos;s just luck that he hasn &apos;t been able to break into that box yet .
i &apos;ve always believed luck to be a function of intent --
in this case , mine .
when these dark clouds were gathering ,
i took measures to keep agent keen safe
to ride out the storm .
are you ready to do your part now ?
i won &apos;t let him have her .
i &apos;ll take that as a yes .
the best way you can help is by continuing to guard elizabeth .
and when the time comes , make sure karakurt
reaches the f.b.i. safely .
karakurt . the russian ?
what does he have to do with this ?
he &apos;s agreed to confess his sins to the u.s. government ,
including the ones he committed on behalf of the cabal
to frame agent keen .
cooper and tom keen are holding karakurt
in a cabin near lake yvonne .
i can have him in the city within the hour .
cooper and tom ?
he tried to tell you , donald . you didn &apos;t listen .
apparently , you have a disregard for tom keen
that exceeds even my own .
i have to meet someone .
remember , guard elizabeth
and keep karakurt alive .
donald .
i find him so stiff so much of the time .
he doesn &apos;t appreciate life &apos;s trimmings .
take yourself , for example .
it &apos;s my understand he fired you for helping elizabeth
come to my rescue .
he had every right .
i went behind his back .
i &apos;m willing to take responsibility for my actions .
watch out . that &apos;s the kind of spirit that could save america .
thank you for meeting me , samar .
what do you want ?
we &apos;re going to clear elizabeth &apos;s name .
it &apos;ll involve a sizable drug haul ,
an f.b.i. heist in the u.s. treasury department .
but first , i need to make an appointment .
an appointment with whom ?
with the foreign minister of venezuela .
how long is this gonna take ?
i &apos;d say about 20 seconds and we should be there .
okay . good .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m going to have to call you back .
where &apos;s reven wright ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to find out .
this is not like her .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m worried something &apos;s happened .
wanna know what i think ?
i think the director has something to do with this , because --
you are talking about the director
of the national clandestine services here .
you threw him out of here once .
you gotta do it again before it &apos;s too late .
if he has intelligence , i can &apos;t just overrule him .
look , reven said i could trust you .
and without her here , it &apos;s --
i need your help .
do you remember karakurt ?
the russian assassin .
harold cooper &apos;s holding him at a cabin near lake yvonne .
he &apos;s willing to talk , and when he does ,
it &apos;ll clear keen of all terrorist charges .
but if the director gets --
i &apos;ve already asked my sources to confirm the director &apos;s intel .
if we can show that there &apos;s no credible threat ,
i &apos;ll make sure he backs down .
as for reven wright ,
last time we talked , she mentioned an associate .
um , what was his name ?
tommy markin .
maybe he has something to do with her disappearance .
does that name mean anything to you ?
tommy markin .
no .
never heard of him .
reven wright &apos;s not coming back .
how do you know ?
tommy markin .
was a guy i told reven about , only reven ,
and hitchin just asked about him .
laurel hitchin is in the cabal .
and i just told her where to find
the only person who can save keen .
she just told the director .
okay , okay . uh , glass half @-@ full .
there &apos;s someone who can save agent keen ?
karakurt .
cooper &apos;s hiding him at a cabin near lake yvonne .
he &apos;s not answering .
i gotta get him to move karakurt
before the director &apos;s goons get there .
go . she &apos;ll be fine .
you know better than anyone , they can &apos;t break in there .
what if they figure out the code ?
they won &apos;t .
how do you know ?
i &apos;m the one who changed it .
u.s. marshals are gonna be here in three hours .
if i &apos;m not back , you let keen out for them ,
only them .
ok .
rafael !
reddington , what are you doing here ?
rafael .
it &apos;s time to meet with your boss .
i need to meet with him today .
i can &apos;t . it &apos;s not possible .
this is for you . happy birthday .
my birthday was in august .
my goodness .
well , time flies when you &apos;re on the run .
please , let &apos;s get out of the open .
there &apos;s nothing i can do for you .
the foreign minister , he &apos;s traveling today .
you see that lovely woman there ?
the one with the camera ?
she &apos;s a stringer for u.p.i.
dear , dear friend .
shoots my christmas card every year .
she has a wonderful eye for composition and detail .
an intuitive sense of timing to capture the moment .
a warm embrace between old friends .
the exchange of a gift .
the intimacy of a quiet conversation
in the backseat of a car .
but the curious thing is ,
pictures never tell the whole story .
for instance , the only story here will be
your friendly meeting with an international criminal
wanted by the f.b.i. , interpol .
i wonder how long you &apos;ll survive
once that story hits the venezuelan press ?
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t help myself .
it &apos;s a photo album for your press clippings .
rafael .
the meeting with the foreign minister will happen today .
is it set ?
the foreign minister will be making a fuel stop
at kirby heliport at 3 : 00 p.m. today .
i &apos;ll have 15 minutes with him .
what &apos;s our next move ?
rendezvous will be fruitless
unless we can retrieve a certain care package .
the f.b.i. took it into custody this morning .
that package is the ticket to elizabeth &apos;s freedom .
what &apos;s in the package ?
el dorado .
the lost city of gold ?
it was never a city .
when spanish explorers reached south america ,
they heard stories about a gold @-@ dusted tribal chief
dumping vast piles of treasure into lake guatavita as an offering .
the spaniards actually drained the lake .
of course , all they found was a handful of trinkets .
so they killed all the natives ,
and el dorado came to represent
the fantasy of boundless wealth --
and that is what &apos;s inside the package .
i don &apos;t understand .
you will , once we steal it from the f.b.i.
i mean , how many times do i have to tell you ?
it wasn &apos;t about sex .
if it wasn &apos;t about the sex , then why &apos;d you have sex ?
why not invite him to join your book club ?
because i hate my book club .
and the only reason i joined that book club
is because you were never home .
doug was just , you know , company .
with a series of regrettable mistakes along the way .
for god &apos;s sake , harold , would you please answer that phone ?
the cabin . karakurt . you have to leave now .
‭ what ? how do you know ‬ about karakurt ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
the bottom line is the cabal knows you &apos;re stashing karakurt
in the cabin near lake yvonne .
look , can they track it down ?
yes .
my neighbor owns the cabin .
they &apos;ll search our phone records .
take karakurt out now .
i &apos;m not with him . tom keen is .
so call him .
i won &apos;t get through .
that &apos;s the whole point of the cabin .
it &apos;s remote . no cell phone coverage .
how far away are you ?
hour . minimum .
all right , i &apos;m closer .
look , just text me the address .
i &apos;m on my way now .
so when they determine the stress points on the box ,
then what ?
not having much luck ?
no , we &apos;ll find a way in .
he &apos;ll come for you .
reddington ? yes , i expect he will ,
now that his prima ballerina is trapped in a jewelry box .
did you ever find out ?
find out what ?
his connection to you .
it &apos;s always been curious to me .
follows you around like a faithful bloodhound .
but you still don &apos;t know .
well , that &apos;s too bad .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s a very unsatisfying way to go out ,
don &apos;t you think ?
how much time do we have ?
the f.b.i. in west virginia would &apos;ve taken the care package
into their custody this morning when they arrested keen .
but there &apos;s no f.b.i. field office in west virginia
to store evidence , so they would &apos;ve sent a team
from their pittsburgh field office to collect it .
they should be on the road back to pittsburgh by now .
we need to intercept them
before they reach their field office .
the trick is to purloin the package
without them knowing we &apos;ve taken it .
for that ,
we need more stolen evidence .
you keep a storage locker in west virginia ?
i keep a storage locker filled with useful items in most states .
two or three in the red states .
steaks ?
bistecca alla fiorentina ,
sourced from a breed of cattle in southern tuscany .
the ultimate expression of beef ,
with a bowl of fagioli ,
a &apos; 96 , &apos; 97 barolo .
these need another month to cure .
i never took you for a ...
drug dealer ? absolutely not .
well , not really .
i &apos;ve made a rather healthy investment in a consortium
that supplies medical marijuana to facilities in colorado ,
oregon , washington ,
district of columbia .
but simply as an effort to diversify
into more legitimate businesses .
as for consumption ,
i must admit to a fondness for any well @-@ appointed opium den ,
and a bit of hashish goes well
with just about anything .
but stimulants , i have no taste for .
i prefer that slight curve at the small of the back ,
the swell of a breast ,
the soft nape of the neck to quicken my heartbeat .
nonetheless , after a rather contentious
and messy negotiation in cartagena ,
this was all that was left on the table , so i took it .
cocaine still remains a valid currency to some of my clients .
especially in england . the wealthy brits ?
they are cocaine mad over there . go figure .
why don &apos;t you grab some kilos off the top
and let &apos;s go stage a crime scene ?
this is fun .
who had the pleasure ?
that would be me .
head on . 35 miles an hour .
just like my uncle vic on a saturday night .
sorry about the short notice , morgan .
chuck . nice paint job .
thanks . careful . it &apos;s still wet .
well , gang &apos;s all here . let &apos;s get to work .
my name is agent morrison in the west virginia office .
yes , i called this in two hours ago .
i need someone here from evidence recovery asap .
that &apos;s right .
30 bags of cocaine , exit 129a off the i @-@ 64 .
can you get them here now , please ?
i &apos;ve been babysitting this evidence all day .
thank you , guys .
time to run .
as soon as you get the package ,
bring it straight to kirby heliport .
the plan hinges on that package .
i &apos;ll be there .
hey . you okay ?
i &apos;ve been better .
okay , you &apos;re almost there .
in an hour , ressler will move you to a holding cell
at the courthouse .
you &apos;ll be safe there .
i &apos;m having trouble breathing .
just the man i &apos;m looking for .
one of my technicians figured out why the
code box does not work .
apparently it was changed .
coincidentally enough , just prior to our arrival .
that must be ...
what ?
a mistake ?
yes , probably .
but we can &apos;t prove it .
technology being what it is and all .
and you are the tech guy .
aram , i can &apos;t ...
i can &apos;t breathe .
what &apos;s happening to her ?
‭ i &apos;m sure i don &apos;t know . ‬
losing oxygen in there ?
i &apos;m sorry . we don &apos;t have the door code .
i &apos;ll have one of my men look into it right away .
that would be a tragedy .
she &apos;d better be worth it .
who &apos;s that ?
the girl .
you know , the one who annulled your marriage .
i know about you two . i know you &apos;re risking your life
for someone who doesn &apos;t want anything to do with --
hey , don &apos;t shoot .
don &apos;t shoot . it &apos;s donald ressler .
all right , open it .
what are you doing here ?
cooper sent me .
look , we gotta get him out of here .
like hell we do .
the director knows you have karakurt .
the cabal is coming .
no offense , but i &apos;ll wait for cooper to tell me that .
someone &apos;s out there !
the cabal &apos;s not coming .
they &apos;re already here .
okay , breathe slowly and steady .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
even if they shut out the air ,
i should be able to breathe in here for hours , right ?
nitrogen .
he &apos;s pumping nitrogen in through the vents .
it would -- oh , my god , it would strip the oxygen out
in minutes .
you wouldn &apos;t be able to smell it either .
what , are you guys just gonna watch this happen ?
she can &apos;t breathe .
the director said he &apos;s working on the problem .
he is not , and you know that !
do something . do something !
okay , right . okay , agent keen . okay , hang on .
i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m gonna see if i can access
the ventilation system from my terminal .
okay ? it &apos;s , um , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i &apos;ll be right back .
how did the director know that we had karakurt ?
how about we focus on the problem at hand ?
we gotta put down these targets so that i can get back to keen .
where is she ?
f.b.i. custody .
the cabal is trying to get at her .
you &apos;re just a one @-@ man justice league , aren &apos;t you ?
you know you &apos;re gonna get us all killed before this is over .
get me out of here !
keen !
clear !
you okay ?
i &apos;m not ! ‬
least you could give me a weapon so i can defend myself .
not if it &apos;s aimed at our backs , no way .
i can &apos;t access the air system ,
but i &apos;m trying to override it with a rombertik .
it &apos;s gonna take a little bit of time , liz .
oh , my god . liz , i have to let you out .
please !
damn it , are you even listening ? i --
i &apos;ll go to the press .
i don &apos;t care !
there are witnesses here .
i will tell the world
what you &apos;re doing here .
fix the air !
i don &apos;t know about this , peter .
it &apos;ll go down as an equipment malfunction .
and there is no one to trace it to .
yeah ? and what if he opens the door ?
well , we return to the original plan .
we take elizabeth keen to an undisclosed location
for questioning , from which she will try to escape .
and then ... we &apos;ll be forced to shoot her .
in any case , you are looking at a ghost .
do you have any idea how long i &apos;ve been standing out here ?
hey , tell it to dispatch . we were halfway to pittsburgh
before we got the call to come all the way back .
okay , let &apos;s just load up .
you know we can &apos;t let you handle the evidence .
and i &apos;d advise you to check your watch
because i &apos;ve been out in the sun on my feet all day
without a bite to eat since 6 : 00 a.m.
we offered her a doughnut .
hey , i &apos;ve been meaning to ask one of you federal boys .
what does it take to be a g @-@ man ?
see , i got this lazy eye . it &apos;s got a mind of its own .
you suppose that would be an issue ?
no offense , but we &apos;re short on time ourselves today .
here .
are we good ?
what ? ‬
hey . i need your assurance that nothing in that van
is going to go missing . are we good ?
yeah . relax .
it &apos;s as safe as can be .
let &apos;s go !
take the left !
ah , this isn &apos;t gonna be pretty .
i &apos;m the one who tipped off the cabal about this hunting cabin .
are you kidding me ? why would you do that ?
trusted the wrong person .
i mean , yes , you were just doing what you thought was right .
even if you were dead wrong .
my father was a cop .
he died because he wouldn &apos;t go on the take .
was set up by his own partner , tommy markin .
you know , i spent all these years
wanting to believe that he died for the right thing .
i &apos;m not so sure now .
principles are a bitch , man .
i avoid them at all cost .
i just hope your old man taught you how to shoot .
hang on , liz . come on , you have to .
come on , a little longer .
come on . liz ?
i , uh , i &apos;m afraid we &apos;re out of options .
can &apos;t seem to figure out what &apos;s wrong with this air system .
liz .
liz ?
liz ? wake up !
liz !
navabi .
what &apos;s that , son ?
the pass code -- it is &quot; navabi . &quot;
it &apos;s &quot; navabi &quot; ! open the door .
n @-@ a @-@ v @-@ a @-@ b @-@ i.
open the door . open the door ! do it !
open the door . come on .
come on . open it !
come on . okay . come on , liz . come on , liz .
yeah , yeah .
you &apos;re okay .
liz . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . so sorry .
gracias .
mr. foreign minister ,
thank you for altering your itinerary to meet me .
and how is el presidente ?
he has irritable bowels .
but what can you expect ?
we just borrowed another $ 5 billion from china .
so , what is this about , reddington ?
i was told a matter of national interest .
indeed .
i believe i can help your president &apos;s stomach condition .
oh , you &apos;re gonna erase my country &apos;s debt ?
no , but i can give you some walking @-@ around money . please .
gentlemen !
we can preserve the quiet tranquility of these woods
if you just send karakurt out now .
you have 30 seconds before we begin shooting .
there &apos;s no way we &apos;re sending him out .
agreed .
then how &apos; bout giving me a weapon ?
it &apos;s not like i can run .
come on , give him a gun .
15 seconds !
the cabal , the ones coming for liz ...
they &apos;re not gonna get her .
let &apos;s just get it over with .
♬ once when you were young ♬
♬ pedaling through the sun ♬
♬ the light streamed through your body like a glass ♬
♬ but then the changes come ♬
♬ things are good undone ♬
♬ and the things you lose , they don &apos;t come back again ♬
♬ so you want to go back again ♬
check for survivors .
knees !
i &apos;ll just , uh , take that .
let &apos;s get out of here .
i won &apos;t let you take her .
aram , put the gun down !
they &apos;ll shoot you without thinking twice .
i don &apos;t care .
i do .
you &apos;ve done enough .
no , i didn &apos;t .
i opened the door .
agent mojtabal , stand down .
aram . aram , look at me . look at me .
i don &apos;t blame you for letting me out .
i don &apos;t .
now please put the gun down .
let &apos;s go .
excuse me !
where exactly do you think you &apos;re taking this young lady ?
mrs. panabaker , right on time .
i believe punctuality is a virtue ,
as is following orders .
my orders are to make sure elizabeth keen
is transported safely
to the e. barrett prettyman courthouse .
and i have actionable intel that requires us
to move agent keen to fort mcnair .
i am aware of the intel .
so is d.n.i. , who &apos;s reviewed it
and upheld the original agreement .
as national security advisor , this is my call to make .
not according to this .
oh , don &apos;t take my word for it .
get the director of national intelligence on the line .
oh , well , then i guess i &apos;ll call him myself .
why would venezuela ever agree to such a ridiculous proposal ?
why , to stick it to the united states , of course .
they &apos;ve been trying to topple your regime for years .
if we do as you suggest ,
the united states would just impose more sanctions .
our shelves are already bare .
this would hurt my people and my economy
for generations to come .
this meeting is over .
diaz , i told you i could put money back
in venezuela &apos;s central bank .
and i &apos;ve told you ,
you couldn &apos;t possibly give us enough money
to make what you &apos;re asking worth the risk .
do you know the story of el dorado ?
thank you , my dear .
those are chromium @-@ plated
master @-@ printing plates for the $ 100 bill ,
created using the u.s. treasury department &apos;s
own software upgrades plate design ,
encoding techniques --
where did you get these ?
there was this plane that fell out of the sky ,
a group of anti @-@ capitalists .
terrorists in funny masks . but i digress .
the point is i &apos;m giving el jefe
the ability to print as much money as he &apos;d like to print .
you son of a gun .
i &apos;ve been called worse .
found a ride .
your weapons on the ground .
or i &apos;ll kill him .
he &apos;ll kill me anyway , so just drop him .
just drop the son of a bitch .
come on , man , you &apos;re f.b.i. you never put your weapon down .
just ... second he shoots me , drop him .
drop him !
all right , you win . okay ?
did you even go to the academy ?
you should &apos;ve listened to your friend .
i figured you two could use some backup .
good morning .
agent ressler , listen to me .
put the gun down .
you should leave .
stop .
do you know the damage you &apos;ve done ?
that your organization has done to this country , to my friends ?
i don &apos;t care about your friends , and i hate this country .
well , &quot; hate &quot; is a strong word .
i like the part where i make bail
and catch the next plane to france .

sure , i am .
and not just any courtroom , but a courtroom of my choosing ,
with the judge of my choosing .
god bless america .
agent ressler .
you &apos;re not gonna do this .
you deserve to die .
put down the gun .
i know he does , but not by your hand .
since when did you grow a conscience ?
i don &apos;t know . since i &apos;ve been hanging out with you .
i &apos;m not happy about it either .
ah , he &apos;s right . we bring him in , he walks .
he doesn &apos;t pay for any of this .
your dad .
you wanna know if he died for nothing .
whether he did or didn &apos;t
depends on whether you pull that trigger .
matias solomon , you &apos;re under arrest ...
for the attempted murder of a federal agent ,
for the attempted murder of a material witness
in a federal investigation , treason , espionage ...
conspiracy to -- you know what ?
why don &apos;t i get you a penal code ?
it would be easier to figure out what you haven &apos;t done .
yes , sir .
i understand .
i stand corrected .
i have never seen two people so disappointed
that the country isn &apos;t under attack .
yeah , well , i &apos;m not convinced .
so let &apos;s get agent keen transferred , shall we ?
my men are on site .
and they will stay on site .
i consulted with reven wright before i drafted the order .
keen isn &apos;t going anywhere without one agent ,
donald ressler present , to oversee her transfer .

sorry i &apos;m late .

come closer , aram .
there &apos;s nobody down there .
not at the moment .
so then ...
why did you ask me to meet you at an empty grave ?
there are ...
foundational elements in our lives .
people ...
that form the brick and mortar of who we are .
people that are so deeply imbedded
that we take their existence for granted
until suddenly , they &apos;re not there .
and we ...
collapse into rubble .
i &apos;ve stood over the open grave of someone i &apos;ve loved ...
too often .
once for my mother .
and then ... the others .
i needed to recall this feeling because ...
i &apos;d be staring at another body right now
if not for you , aram .
it wasn &apos;t weakness that prevented you
from watching your friend die today .
it was hope ,
and thank heavens you were in a hopeful mood .
you saved elizabeth .
i &apos;m forever in your debt .
now gather your team .
it &apos;s time to take down the cabal .
