max , did you pick up the tip from table two ?
no , but i &apos;m pretty sure i picked up a staph infection .
so they literally gave me their two cents worth .
this is so embarrassing ,
even abe lincoln won &apos;t make eye contact .
girls , i need you to do something for me .
you know the rule : nothing for you ,
on you , near you , or in us .
i &apos;m going to restroom . keep eye on the kitchen .
i have a four @-@ minute egg and a five @-@ minute date
with the sports illustrated swimsuit issue .
hey , do you see what i see ?
a fire ?
no , a way out of this job .
lord jesus , there &apos;s a fire .
you two gonna do anything about that ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not .
i don &apos;t mess with fire or presbyterians .
fire , fire !
i smell fire !
well , don &apos;t just stand there . do something !
we are .
s &apos;mores !
you &apos;d think you want this place to burn to the ground .
you &apos;d think that .
caroline , do something .
i &apos;m on it .
chocolate ?
han , not too close .
you know you can never get the smell of korean barbecue
out of your clothes .
either he put the fire out ,
or that little robot just had an orgasm .
welcome to the high dessert bar .
i &apos;m the hostess slash quasi @-@ manager .
first day in , got a huge promosh .
i hate to brag ,
but the word &quot; dazzling &quot; was used .
yeah , by you .
little to no power has really gone to your head .
it has .
she &apos;s like the putin of pastry .
but doesn &apos;t it feel good
to not just be working at the diner ?
i haven &apos;t slipped on one used baby diaper all day .
speaking of babies ,
look , there &apos;s han .
that &apos;s , like , the third time
i caught him spying on us .
why would he stalk two of his worst employees ?
i know . it &apos;s like where &apos;s waldo ?
寻找出主人翁威力的游戏
when you don &apos;t want to find waldo .
not seeing a hostess up in here .
she meant quasi @-@ manager .
if marty scorsese walks in here ,
do you want him to seat himself ?
但其中有8次与得奖失之交臂
he &apos;ll be lost . lost .
sorry , joe , i was just over there giving max--
honey , i &apos;ll download an audiobook
if i want to hear a story .
i want you to meet someone .
me too , and i &apos;m sure i will when the time is right
and i &apos;m open to it .
kind of focusing on me right now .
stop .
learn to read faces .
i &apos;m not talking about you .
i &apos;m talking about him .
hello , pleasure to meet you .
i &apos;m nashit .
nashit &apos;s an indian name ,
and isn &apos;t that an irish accent i detect ?
or have i just lost consciousness from how white your teeth are ?
yes , it is .
my father &apos;s indian . my mother &apos;s irish .
he &apos;s irish . he &apos;s indian .
he &apos;s east meets west .
he &apos;s everything in a hot irish coffee ,
boy band package .
i found him on the street next to a dirty chair .
hi , i &apos;m caroline ,
the hostess slash quasi @-@ manager at the high .
are you high ?
&apos;cause that was a lot of talking .
who is this , and where can i get one ?
this is nashit , our new waiter .
oh , it &apos;s lovely to meet you .
can you say &quot; magically delicious &quot; ?
i really want nashit to work out .
i like it when good @-@ looking people succeed .
well , i guess that &apos;s good news for me .
is it ?
hi , honey .
have you met the new waiter ?
i love him . he &apos;s my favorite .
if i did men , he would &apos;ve been done by now .
hmm , so you think you &apos;re pretty .
well , i do too .
okay , nashit , pay attention .
these are the tables . this is the dessert bar .
and these are my boobs .
max , be professional .
these are my boobs , sir .
please , i have to make him a waiter .
fine , you make him a waiter ,
and i &apos;ll just make him later .
here you go . this isn &apos;t yours , is it ?
no , because they already have dessert .
damn it .
you asked for water , like , an hour ago , didn &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , don &apos;t you worry those lips .
and what &apos;s an hour when we have our whole lives ahead of us ?
max , i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do .
i stink as a waiter .
this is desperate .
well , desperate times call for us making out .
hey , i have a question for you .
your skin is so creamy and white .
you must have a little irish in you .
i &apos;ve had a lot of little irishes in me .
that &apos;s meant to be dirty , right ?
well , i just mean that i think you &apos;re quite beautiful .
oh , well , then i just mean we &apos;re doing it .
i did not think there was somebody
who had a prettier nose or was worse than me waiting tables ,
but here we are .
nashit , there &apos;s not a fork in the mix out there .
now , get out there and fork those women .
take it easy on him .
i don &apos;t him to be all forked out
by the time he gets to me .
i &apos;m gonna have so much sex on my bed with nashit
that i &apos;m gonna need a new sheet .
aren &apos;t you too old for him ?
yeah , but that test said mentally i &apos;m 14,
so we can totally do it .
well , i &apos;m off to chinatown to have someone put needles in me .
oh , my god . i love your coat .
you look gorgeous .
i mean , the way it flows .
okay , so i can see you &apos;re a kiss @-@ ass ,
so here &apos;s the thing .
as my quasi @-@ manager ,
or whatever nonsense you &apos;re telling people ,
i need you to tell max and nashit to cool it .
there are no hookups here at the high .
done , and we can stop staying &quot; quasi &quot;
if we &apos;re both on board with the manager thing .
we &apos;re not .
the high is about fine pastry ,
not someone &apos;s sordid love life .
and in an ironic twist , i need you to kick
my girlfriend &apos;s hot ass out of here
if she comes in .
here &apos;s $ 100 .
that &apos;s $ 100 .
consider her hot ass out the door .
we &apos;re in a fight .
she got drunk , stole my black card ,
但与传说中美国运通的 &quot; 黑卡 &quot; 完全不是一个档次
and bought 90 people soup at barney greengrass ,
and the soup isn &apos;t even good there .
do not take this as a no , because i want the money ,
but why can &apos;t you just tell her yourself ?
i can &apos;t tell her myself .
she &apos;s younger than me ,
and everyone knows the mommy thing just isn &apos;t sexy .
make sure she eats something and gets home safe .
caroline , i have a question for you .
what do i do with the notes the women give me ?
you &apos;ve gotten notes ?
just a few .
how could women be this desperate ?
max , this one &apos;s from you .
they &apos;re mostly all from me ,
except the business card .
i don &apos;t need no damn card
to let him know i &apos;m all business .
max , joe just told me there are no hookups at the high ,
and judging from this very detailed picture you drew ,
that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re planning .
oh , i was planning more . i just ran out of paper .
we can &apos;t lose these jobs .
i have two $ 100 bills , and i &apos;m this close
to pulling the trigger on an amazon prime account .
amazon prime ?
you have been driven mad with power .
fresh , flakey pastry .
and speaking of flakes ,
there &apos;s joe &apos;s flakey girlfriend .
can someone help me get my chair off my coat ?
how did she get in here ?
probably floated in on a cloud of valium .
it &apos;s go time , as in she &apos;s got to go .
you have a better chance moving an actual train wreck ,
but good luck .
allie , hi , you--
allie , hi .
you need--
sorry .
but i am hungover , and i have a headache .
could i get a latte with a side of weed ?
no , because this isn &apos;t amsterdam
or bill maher &apos;s house .
now , you need to leave .
you know joe doesn &apos;t want you in here .
well , i &apos;m not leaving .
my legs won &apos;t move
because my muscle relaxers just kicked in .
john , can you do me a favor ?
walk allie outside ,
and by that , i mean pick her up
and carry her outside .
i went to pastry school .
i &apos;m not shrek .
of course not . you &apos;re much more fiona .
girl , that &apos;s good .
i was gonna say the donkey , &apos; cause i have a fine ass .
okay , fine .
driver , two stops . barney &apos;s and fro @-@ yo .
earl , we &apos;re late again . did you keep us alive ?
max , i can barely keep myself alive .
this morning , i had to jump @-@ start my heart
by putting my finger in the socket
tom and jerry style .
oh , hello .
so what did you girls do today ?
i haven &apos;t seen you since right here last night .
oh , really , han ?
&apos;cause i swear i saw you lurking around outside the high .
it was either you ,
or pikachu is visiting new york .
that one barely grazed me ,
because i &apos;m korean ,
and pikachu is japanese .
you don &apos;t know anything about pokemon .
han , you may not be japanese ,
but in the future , you &apos;re definitely gonna be poked by a mon .
and it was you .
no , it was not .
yeah , it was .
wasn &apos;t .
was .
wasn &apos;t .
wasn &apos;t .
was--wasn &apos;t .
english is my second language .
admit it , you &apos;re jealous
we &apos;re spending time with another restaurant .
i am not jealous .
are so .
am not .
am not .
are so--not .
oh , my god !
caroline , what the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;m smelling a $ 100 bill .
it &apos;s from my other restaurant .
it buys me nice things .
jealous ?
i took you in when you had no one .
hi , can you help me ?
i &apos;m looking for max .
why , hello .
is it too late to be gay ?
nashit ?
oh , my god , he even looks good here in morgue light .
we are so doing it .
caroline , you left your phone on the table at the restaurant .
i confess , i used it as an excuse
to come and see max .
this isn &apos;t mine . it &apos;s joe &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s .
i don &apos;t have an iphone 6 .
i have an iphone sick .
d @-@ o @-@ i @-@ n @-@ g it !
max , why is nashit here ?
because god owes me .
you can &apos;t seriously be into him .
he looks like someone in a boy band .
yeah , and he &apos;s going one direction ...
down there .
but if you sleep with him ,
then nashit is gonna hit the fan .
how do you know you even like him ?
you know what i like ? that we &apos;re doing it .
hey , everybody !
i just got hit by a cab ,
and , boy , am i in the mood for crab legs .
the thing about you , baby--
you bounce back from a good pounding
every single night .
wait a minute .
that &apos;s my booth .
oh , it &apos;s lovely to meet you .
what ?
what the hell kind of accent is that ?
i &apos;m from ireland .
what ?
max , you are not doing it .
are .
not .
are .
not .
not .
please , i went to wharton .
look , we should go to your place when we do it
so that caroline won &apos;t be there while we &apos;re doing it .
lovely , but i just came to america two days ago .
i have no place to go .
in fact ,
i &apos;ve been sleeping on that dirty chair joe spoke of .
what ?
is he singing ?
oh , my god .
he &apos;s gorgeous and homeless ?
that &apos;s your dream guy .
we are so doing it !
ugh , this is impossible .
i feel like i &apos;m putting an oscar dress on precious .
十分肥胖 还曾因过度肥胖惹来非议
i &apos;m making up the couch for nashit .
that is so nice of you .
he &apos;s gonna need a place to crash after we have sex .
no , that &apos;s off the table .
i can &apos;t believe you invited him to stay here .
and i can &apos;t believe you refused to sleep at starbucks tonight
to give us some privacy .
i mean , you like nora jones .
max likey .
max , listen .
no , you listen .
i can &apos;t afford candy , so he has got to be it .
thanks for the shower .
oh , no , his muscles point to his penis .
max , stop with the banging .
i &apos;m not letting you out while you &apos;re still in heat .
it &apos;s not me .
i &apos;m making a list of ways to kill you !
i feel like i &apos;m being a bother ,
and i think i &apos;m sleeping on a bong .
open up .
i know what &apos;s going on in there .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s joe .
she must &apos;ve found out about you and max hooking up .
oh , no .
max , joe is here .
you need to do that thing you do
to scare people out of the hallway .
what do we think , guard dog
or little old lady with poor eyesight and loaded gun ?
fine , i &apos;m going .
this is why i never leave manhattan .
hey , you need to get in the girls &apos; apartment ?
i have a key .
find it here in my big bag .
i know it &apos;s in here somewhere .
well , i got the lip balm .
i got--oh , look , i got the holy bible .
i got--
oh , look . oh , the directv remote .
oh , my god , i &apos;m losing estrogen .
max , you and nashit go hide in your room ,
but no sex .
you heard her , no sex ,
so everything but , and i mean everything ,
and i mean but .
oh , here it is . it &apos;s right--
it was right under the cold cuts the whole time .
caroline .
hey . hi , joe .
yeah .
yeah , the shorter hair makes sense now .
yeah .
good for you , caroline .
i hope you like long , boring stories .
okay , where &apos;s allie ? i know she &apos;s here .
i put a spy app on her phone ,
and i &apos;m not proud of it , but i &apos;m a jealous woman .
oh , her phone . i have it .
she left it at the high when i threw her ass out today
per your instructions .
i don &apos;t know how i thought this thing
was gonna work out to begin with .
we met at coachella .
we were both on molly ,
this intensely hot filipino girl .
i &apos;m hearing sexual sounds .
and hints of secret shame coming from the bedroom .
allie is here .
no , no one &apos;s here .
that &apos;s just our white noise machine .
i &apos;m shocked . you &apos;re not even her type .
your lips are like two flair @-@ pen marks .
that &apos;s hot .
please don &apos;t fire nashit !
the dr. seuss hats were my idea .
we were playing hop on pop .
i was pop .
i didn &apos;t even know there was a boy in there .
i only saw you .
okay , since there are no hookups at the high ,
if you don &apos;t stop sleeping with him immediately ,
my new manager ...
caroline here
is gonna have to kick his beautiful butt to the curb .
but i was mid @-@ doing @-@ it !
honey , there &apos;s a real funky smell in here .
i got to get out of here .
ps , this is where you live ?
take another $ 100 .
earl , hi .
what kind of mood is max in ?
pretty good .
on the max scale , she &apos;s below slightly drunk
but above punching a customer out .
oh , good .
i was worried she &apos;d be mad at me
&apos;cause i had to get rid of her boy toy .
caroline , i &apos;d put my hearing aids back in
if i wanted to hear a story .
guess what i have for you in my purse .
the tampon i asked for last week ?
no , and again , so sorry about that .
really dropped that ball .
gummy worms .
yes , i took away your man candy ,
but i got you these , the hot ones that you like
from the good candy store with the sneeze guards .
fancy .
and don &apos;t worry about nashit .
i got him another job .
hot worm !
clean glasses coming through .
nice rack .
now i know why guys like saying that to me .
there he is !
there &apos;s the new employee .
han , i can &apos;t believe you would hire someone
just &apos; cause max asked you to .
this has nothing to do with max or you .
the boy here said something to me
that you two couldn &apos;t understand .
what &apos;s that , sir ?
that i was a hard worker ?
that &apos;s it ! yes !
manna from heaven .
i actually have an employee who works .
jealous ?
now , this job , i can do .
you know , growing up , i had five brothers and sisters ,
and since i was the least attractive ,
i had to clean all the dishes .
meet you in the dish room , nashit .
max , what are you doing ?
there may not be hookups at the high ,
but there are hookups here at our lowest low ,
and we are doing it .
caroline likey .
