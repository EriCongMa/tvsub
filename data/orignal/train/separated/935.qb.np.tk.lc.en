there was flirtation .
here &apos;s my card . if you see anything suspicious ,
i want you to call me ...
or even if you don &apos;t .
there was confrontation .
after all those years that i supported you ,
took a backseat to your career , you couldn &apos;t do the same for me .
oh ! aah ! there was a fight .
leave me alone !
and ... there were consequences .
susan delfino was charitable to a fault .
she just couldn &apos;t resist lending a hand .
there wasn &apos;t a lost pet she could ignore ...
a girl in uniform she could refuse ...
or a struggling artist she could say no to .
so when it came to a neighbor in need ...
oh , my god . paul , what happened ?
susan was only too eager to help .
i started having chest pains ,
passed out , came to , dialed 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
they &apos;ve been running tests all night .
well , i &apos;m gonna be here for you till they figure it out .
i brought you these-- magazines , water .
you &apos;re unbelievable .
i &apos;ve got a street full of neighbors ,
and the only one who comes to see me is the woman i yelled at .
sorry about that .
it was my fault .
i shouldn &apos;t have asked you about getting my house back .
i sounded like a vulture .
mr ... young , we &apos;ve got your test results .
could you excuse us for a moment , susan ?
oh , yeah . i &apos;ll wait outside .
well , good news . your e.k.g. came back normal .
so it &apos;s not a heart attack ?
it &apos;s not a heart attack .
says here you &apos;ve been experiencing dizziness ,
nausea , stomach cramps .
that &apos;s right . what do you think it is ?
i think unless you &apos;ve been poisoned
or you &apos;re pregnant , it &apos;s probably just stress .
poisoned ?
yeah . i remember this case when i was an intern .
a man came in with the same symptoms .
turns out his wife was putting antifreeze in his oatmeal .
little bit every day so it wasn &apos;t obvious .
but eventually , it killed him .
good lesson for all of us-- don &apos;t piss off the old lady .
what did he say ?
he thinks it &apos;s stress .
just stress ?
that &apos;s a relief . so you must be starving .
what can i make you for dinner tonight ?
yes , susan delfino just couldn &apos;t resist
lending a hand to a neighbor in trouble .
i &apos;m sure anything you bring
will be a huge help to me .
... which was about to cause her some trouble of her own .
no matter how secure we are ,
we all experience moments of dread .
it may be just before we open our credit card bill ...
or hand over a note from our teacher ...
or step on the scale after a week away from the gym .
yes , we all experience moments of dread ,
and sometimes
we have no one to blame ...
but ourselves .
daddy &apos;s home . how are my--
&quot; bloody stranger two &quot; ? she can &apos;t watch this !
daddy , no !
look , this is about some ... stranger who comes to town
and starts murdering slutty teenagers !
yeah . it &apos;s a good lesson for when she &apos;s older .
don &apos;t be a slutty teenager .
gaby , this is way too violent .
oh , the kid &apos;s used to violence .
you &apos;ve seen me make her eat carrots .
besides , juanita knows the movie &apos;s fake .
right , honey ?
duh . there &apos;s no way one speargun
could shoot through three heads in real life .
exactly . two , maybe .
maybe .
oh , carlos , relax .
juanita &apos;s tough . she &apos;ll be fine .
aah ! he &apos;s out there !
oh ! calm down , sweetie . who &apos;s out there ?
the bloody stranger .
he was standing on our lawn looking at our house .
the bloody stranger . nice .
no , honey , we talked about this , remember ?
how it was all pretend ?
can i sleep in here with you guys ?
you can sleep with her . i &apos;m gonna sleep in your bed .
celia &apos;s in my bed .
then i &apos;ll sleep in celia &apos;s bed .
she wet her bed .
come on in .
hey !
hey !
look who &apos;s home in time for dinner !
yeah , well , i couldn &apos;t miss spaghetti night .
spaghetti night &apos;s tuesday , dad .
you made it home for taco night .
taco night ? ay , caramba !
hey--no . i &apos;m kidding . mwah .
hey , your mom made a lovely dinner ,
so the least that i could do was bring home dessert .
plane tickets ?
that &apos;s right .
i planned the family vacation this year .
you did what ?
seven days , six nights
at the royal kailua spa and resort
in ... hawaii .
well done , sir !
i &apos;ve never been there !
you bought the tickets without talking to me first ?
okay . not exactly
&quot; wow , tom , you &apos;re the greatest husband in the world . &quot;
but i told you , i already planned our vacation ,
just like i &apos;ve been doing for the last 16 years .
well , there you go . you deserve a year off .
wait until you see
the waterslides at this place .
cool !
yeah . yeah , cool . except i just spent two weeks
mapping out a route for a camping trip ,
and i put a deposit down on an r.v.
okay , so we eat the deposit .
wish i could eat it right now .
and i told my sister we &apos;d stop by and visit on the way .
we get back from hawaii ,
we fly her out to see us here--
boom ! problem solved .
and yet still no
&quot; you &apos;re the greatest husband in the world &quot; ?
oh , my god .
first class ?
you are the greatest husband in the world !
aah ! oh , my god ! we &apos;re going to hawaii ! aah !
yes ! so lucky ! ohh .
yeah .
hawaii .
principal hobson !
principal hobson ?
principal hobson !
uh--susan ! hey ! great to see you !
did you get my e @-@ mails ?
i sent you , like , ten .
e @-@ mails ? no .
oh . well , in the first one--
all right . i got them .
and i would be glad to give you your job back ,
but i &apos;m afraid it just isn &apos;t gonna happen .
why not ?
susan , you can &apos;t be surprised that there are consequences
when you show up on the internet holding a feather duster
and wearing a purple bra ?
that was very specific .
well , i @-@ i had to verify the claims in order to--
my point is , the damage was done .
i know . i made a mistake .
but i feel like i deserve a second chance .
if it were up to me , i would give you that chance .
but you know private schools .
the parents &apos; council has all the power .
so ... if i were to win them over ...
well , it would be a start .
thank you . i &apos;ll take it from here .
oh , and i promise ,
no feather duster , no purple bra .
and no black bustier .
nice talking to you .
oh , detective vance . i was just , um , heading out .
i won &apos;t keep you .
i just stopped by to give you another card ,
to replace the one you lost .
what makes you think i lost it ?
i gave it to you two days ago . you never called me ,
so i &apos;m assuming you lost it .
no . i didn &apos;t .
now , is that nice ?
i give you a graceful way to spare my feelings ,
and you clobber me with facts .
you sure you didn &apos;t lose it ?
quite sure . in fact , it &apos;s right here in my purse .
you didn &apos;t throw it away .
that must mean you were thinking of calling .
this is my second try . i can &apos;t ask you again .
is that an ultimatum ?
it &apos;s a fact of courtship--
twice is charmingly persistent .
once more and i &apos;m stalking you .
so you &apos;re courting me ?
i &apos;m trying to .
when will you stop playing hard to get ?
maybe when you stop playing hard to want .
you see how much you enjoy smacking me down ?
why pass up a chance to do it all night ?
come on . one dinner .
fine . this thursday , 8 : 00 p.m.
great . see you then .
i thought you were heading out .
right .
you ... want me to test a tuna noodle casserole ?
is that a problem ?
well , normally we test stuff
like soil samples and ground water ,
but sure , i can do it . what are you looking for ?
antifreeze .
hey . what are you doing tonight ?
a friend of mine &apos;s playing at a jazz club .
oh , thanks , renee , but i have a date .
if you don &apos;t want to come , just say so .
you don &apos;t have to make stuff up .
no ! i really do have a date .
is that so hard to believe ?
uh , slightly .
so who is he ?
he &apos;s a detective . his name is chuck .
chuck vance .
well , don &apos;t stop . i want to hear it all .
actually , that &apos;s all i know .
that &apos;s it ? and you agreed to go out with him ?
i never date a guy
until i &apos;ve done a complete background check .
maybe i should just google him .
amateur .
give me his name
and i will find out everything worth knowing--
marital history , net worth ,
results of his last physical .
the physical seems excessive .
that &apos;s what i thought
till i spent a weekend pinned under a dead linebacker .
why would you let her watch
something called &quot; bloody stranger two &quot; ?
i know , i know .
i &apos;m an idiot . now she &apos;s having nightmares
and crawling into our bed every night .
when i was a kid , i had bad dreams
like you wouldn &apos;t believe-- jumping @-@ out @-@ of @-@ bed ,
running @-@ down @-@ the @-@ hall @-@ screaming kind of dreams .
so what &apos;d you do ?
guess i outgrew &apos; em .
you did ?
juanita , come here !
what are you doing ?
i figured you could talk to her .
you know , give her one of those &quot; it gets better &quot; speeches
you gays love so much .
sweetie , lee wants to talk to you .
so your mom says you &apos;ve been having nightmares .
what are they about ?
i see this creepy guy standing on our lawn .
oh , you poor thing .
you know , when i was little ,
i had nightmares , too .
really ?
yeah .
my brother told me that there was a hospital
for the criminally insane on the outskirts of town .
and at night , the inmates would escape
and kidnap little boys and girls .
but it &apos;s not real .
his brother was just trying to scare him .
oh , no . it was totally real .
one summer , three kids went missing .
until they found them ...
right .
about a month later ... in a ravine .
alive !
no .
come on . they were in a ravine .
what good ever comes out of a ravine ?
what the hell was that ?
i &apos;m just showing her there &apos;s nothing to be frightened of .
my story &apos;s way scarier than hers .
okay . so cindy &apos;s in charge of decorations ,
abby , you &apos;re handling music ...
oh , sorry . sorry . don &apos;t let me interrupt .
susan , what are you doing here ?
i heard you guys were planning an open house night ,
and i &apos;d love to pitch in . how can i help ?
let &apos;s see . you &apos;re legendary for your cleaning abilities .
that didn &apos;t take long .
do you need any refreshments ?
i could make something .
thanks , but if we need any help ,
we &apos;ll call you .
is it still 99 cents a minute ?
okay , uh ...
looks like we should just get this out there .
my family had a really crappy year .
uh , i did some things that i am not proud of .
but i was a damn good teacher when i was at this school .
and i was hoping that you ladies might eventually
support hiring me back .
you want to teach here again ?
i think the parents &apos; council
might have a big problem with that .
look , i @-@ i &apos;m not asking for your forgiveness--
just a chance to earn it .
let me do something for open house .
i really do wanna help .
okay . how about you pick up the streamers ?
streamers ?
if you can handle it .
just be careful not to confuse them with tassels .
meeting adjourned .
i shouldn &apos;t even look at this .
it feels like such an intrusion .
and besides , he &apos;ll be here any minute .
then i &apos;m just in the nick of time .
you found something bad ?
well , for me ,
his salary alone
makes him a non @-@ starter .
but you may be more interested in what &apos;s on page three .
is he a dirty cop ?
or a democrat ?
worse .
hello , chuck .
i was afraid i was early , but , uh ...
looks like you &apos;re all ready .
oh , i &apos;m ready , all right . shall we ?
hope this is okay .
you like italian , right ?
everybody likes italian .
oh , it &apos;s fine .
so let &apos;s talk .
tell me about yourself . tell me everything .
okay , what do you want to know ?
oh , whatever you think is , hmm ... pertinent .
okay . um , i was born in pennsylvania .
i played some ball in college .
um , i have a degree-- criminology .
interesting .
anything else ?
well , i have two kids .
oh . so you &apos;ve been married .
yeah . didn &apos;t work out .
i hope you don &apos;t judge me for that .
oh , no . not for that .
is something wrong , bree ?
i &apos;m just wondering when you were going to tell me
that you &apos;re still married .
i see you &apos;ve done due diligence .
did your source happen to mention
that i filed for divorce last spring ?
and that it hasn &apos;t gone through ,
so technically , you &apos;re still married .
you should have told me .
we haven &apos;t even ordered yet .
you expect me to lead with that ?
&quot; hey , i &apos;m technically married .
&quot; the chicken looks good . &quot;
you shouldn &apos;t be dating at all until your divorce is final .
what if you and your wife reconcile ?
i haven &apos;t spoken to my wife
in a year without my lawyer present .
you can &apos;t blame me for doing a simple background check .
hell , no .
i &apos;m sure you want to avoid another mistake
like your second husband ,
the hit @-@ and @-@ run driver .
orson , was it ?
what ?
tell me , who was creepier--
him or that pharmacist
who killed himself while you were dating ?
where did you hear that ?
i pulled your police file .
i have a file ?
and you pulled it .
how dare you investigate me before our date !
say that again , and this time , listen for the irony .
there is no comparison to what i did .
you could have been dangerous ! i have to protect myself .
oh , women can be dangerous , too ,
especially ones who own four handguns
and a .30 @-@ 06 hunting rifle .
what &apos;s up with that ?
this is outrageous .
you are treating me like a common criminal !
what can i get you folks to start ?
i will not be ordering . i want to go home now .
come on , bree . calm down . have a drink .
i don &apos;t drink . wasn &apos;t that in my file ?
someone &apos;s slipping .
what are you doing ?
hmm ? what do you think i &apos;m doing ?
i think you &apos;re wasting your time ,
much as i did when i planned this year &apos;s vacation .
we should have discussed this .
i wanted to surprise you .
i wasn &apos;t surprised . i was blindsided .
you may call all the shots at work ,
but you &apos;re not the c.f.o. of this family .
you &apos;re right .
for what it &apos;s worth , your road trip sounds amazing .
i just don &apos;t think it &apos;s gonna pan out for this summer .
but you made a hell of a great start for next year &apos;s trip .
don &apos;t pull that management trick on me .
what trick ?
the &quot; yes &quot; sandwich .
start with a compliment , lower the boom ,
end with a compliment . it &apos;s the oldest trick in business ,
and i taught it to you .
lynette , i already promised hawaii to the kids .
you want me to take it away ?
you saw how excited they were .
only because they &apos;ve never had a lavish vacation before .
give me the same budget , and i &apos;ll make my trip
sound twice as good as yours .
oh , i would love to see you try .
okay , then . game on .
we &apos;ll , um , we &apos;ll sit the kids down ,
we &apos;ll each make our presentation . let them decide .
sounds fair to me . game on .
okay . game on .
honey .
i &apos;m not turned on . you &apos;re a very handsome man .
we &apos;re not gonna have sex .
that &apos;s a &quot; no &quot; sandwich .
level with me , bree . do i
still have a chance with you ?
none whatsoever .
then this can &apos;t make things any worse .
that &apos;s right . keep driving , buddy .
why &apos;d you do that ?
get in , violet .
oh , my god . you couldn &apos;t have dropped me off
before you pick up a prostitute ?
you arresting me , chuck ?
just taking you to the women &apos;s shelter .
so what is this , your good deed for the night ?
you trying to impress your date ?
no . that ship has sailed . she hates me more than you do .
why ? what &apos;s wrong with him ?
let &apos;s just say my opinion isn &apos;t any of your concern , miss .
you &apos;re better off without her , chuck .
this one &apos;s got a stick up her ass .
and what qualifies you to make such snap judgments
about people you &apos;ve just met ?
i &apos;m a hooker . it &apos;s what i do .
here we are , and i &apos;m watching to make sure you go in .
you know i &apos;m just gonna be back on that corner tomorrow .
yeah , well , that &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s problem .
when are you gonna give up ?
what i am now ... that &apos;s all i &apos;m ever gonna be .
you think so ?
did you know that ten years ago ,
bree here was turning tricks just like you ?
how dare you .
bree , she needs to hear this .
i must have hauled her ass in 50 times .
then one day , she said , &quot; i &apos;m better than this . &quot;
she got herself to school .
before you knew it , she had a first class catering company ,
so don &apos;t try to tell me
that you can &apos;t make a better life for yourself .
you were really on the street ?
actually , i ...
i don &apos;t like to talk about that part of my life .
i get it .
look at you now , huh ?
it was really nice to meet you .
likewise .
thank you , chuck .
don &apos;t mention it .
i know . way outta line .
you said i had no chance , so i figured , what the hell .
home ?
yes , please .
you were right . found trace amounts of antifreeze ,
but don &apos;t worry . wouldn &apos;t have killed you .
what would happen
if i ate one of these casseroles every day ?
well , for one thing , you &apos;d get tired of tuna casserole .
ahem . if you repeatedly consumed ethylene glycol ,
your heart would start to fail ,
your kidneys would give out . eventually , you &apos;d die .
it &apos;d be a nasty way to go .
i can only imagine .
what are you doing ?
i thought i was borrowing lynette &apos;s tent .
turns out i borrowed a nylon bag of death .
why are you setting up the tent ?
for juanita . i wanna prove to her
there &apos;s no scary guy on the lawn .
i figured if she spends the night camping out here ,
she &apos;ll get over it .
so the kid is scared
there &apos;s a killer lurking outside at night ,
and your solution is to make her sleep out here ?
not alone , you dope . you &apos;ll be with her .
me ?
yeah . what if she &apos;s right ?
what if there is a killer ... or it &apos;s cold ?
oh . forget it .
i got an early meeting tomorrow , and i &apos;m not going in half asleep
because i slept on my lawn .
you caused this problem . you fix it , tonight .
and stop pouting . it &apos;s fun to sleep outside .
i &apos;m sure it is .
that must be why the homeless are always so cheery !
come in .
after our date-- or rather , non @-@ date--
i was very confused .
makes two of us .
i was ... offended when you didn &apos;t tell me the truth
about your marriage and oddly touched
when you told a complete stranger
i was a whore .
well , if you like that ,
you should wait till valentine &apos;s day .
i wanted to know your secrets right away ,
and i didn &apos;t want to tell you mine
until i felt i could trust you ,
and that ... wasn &apos;t fair .
i was no better .
when did dating become so complicated ?
we &apos;re not kids anymore .
we &apos;ve both had our hearts kicked around .
i guess it &apos;s made us a little gun @-@ shy ...
if &quot; gun @-@ shy &quot; is the right word for a woman
with an arsenal as big as yours .
so what do we do ?
i say ...
we forget about the crazy digging for dirt
that we both did .
and just have a normal first date .
all right .
when ?
well , it is lunchtime .
why not ?
i know this little indian place
that does an amazing lamb vindaloo .
how &apos;d you know i like indian food ?
i &apos;d rather not say .
i don &apos;t even know why i wanna work at that school again .
ugh , those smug cliquey moms .
i mean , can you believe that dana gave me streamer duty ?
it &apos;s positively awful .
so tell me , how is paul ?
i hear he went to the hospital ?
he thought he was having a heart attack ,
but the test results came back negative .
do the doctors know what caused it ?
they think it &apos;s stress ,
but i &apos;m worried about him .
oh , don &apos;t be .
well , i think he should go back and have more tests done .
he &apos;ll be fine .
as a nurse , i saw time and again
that the best prescription for stress
is rest and good food .
so sweet of you to make these cookies for him .
well , yeah , i hope it cheers him up .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s just what the doctor ordered .
well ... i wish i could do more .
oh , susan .
you &apos;re doing more for paul than you can possibly know .
the grand canyon .
over a mile deep .
it took six million years to form .
sequoia national forest--
a soaring monument
to nature &apos;s majesty .
so that &apos;s our vacation ?
looking at trees and a hole in the ground ?
now , now , kids , your mom worked hard on this . be kind .
yeah . yeah , if the grand canyon isn &apos;t your scene ...
did she say &quot; scene &quot; ?
you &apos;re bound to love our next stop ...
the screaminator .
seven minutes of sheer roller coaster terror .
&quot; responsible parenting &quot; magazine
calls it the worst idea since the caffeinated juice box .
that &apos;s awesome .
that sounds really ...
oh , me likey that .
that &apos;s very sweet !
any and all
of these thrilling destinations are available to us .
we just point the r.v. ... and drive .
all right !
yes ! oh , man , i can &apos;t wait .
ooh , i forget about the r.v.
won &apos;t it be a little cramped now that we have paige ?
oh , maybe your dad &apos;s right .
maybe we shouldn &apos;t take the r.v.
maybe we should take ...
the road juggernaut 8000 .
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art entertainment system ,
six private sleeping compartments ,
and two full baths ,
one of which justin bieber used on his last tour to make ...
water balloons .
shut up !
shut up !
i &apos;m blown away right now !
we are going on vacation !
follow that , hawaii .
will you take that off ?
no .
juanita , you look ridiculous .
i don &apos;t care how i look .
i don &apos;t want that killer guy to chop off my head .
first of all , a helmet wouldn &apos;t keep him
from chopping off your head .
it would just mean i &apos;d have to clean it
before i gave it back to parker .
second , there is no killer guy .
it &apos;s an actor in a movie .
but i &apos;m still scared .
it &apos;s okay to be scared . it &apos;s even fun sometimes .
but you can &apos;t let that scared come from inside your own head ,
and you have to be able to calm it down if it does .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s people walking by , juanita .
this is what i &apos;m talking about .
this is where you take charge of your fear .
mama , i think it &apos;s the killer .
no , it &apos;s not , juanita .
mom , look !
oh ! who &apos;s out there ? ! go away !
gotcha !
what the hell is wrong with you ? !
i &apos;m trying to help .
by giving me a heart attack , you thought that would help ?
kinda did .
oh , mom , you should &apos;ve seen your face .
i just wanted to show you
that not everything that looks scary actually is . see ?
plastic .
it &apos;s like the movie . it looks scary , but it &apos;s fake .
exactly .
i have to go . bob &apos;s in the shower ,
and he &apos;s about to pay for not liking my
chicken pot pie .
so when you cast your vote tonight , kids ,
cast it for adventure ,
luxury , nature .
&apos;cause hawaii has something for every scavo ,
whether it is circling a smoking volcano in a helicopter ,
or swimming in crystal @-@ clear waters with the dolphins .
it is the vacation of a lifetime .
hawaii , hawaii , hawaii ...
i didn &apos;t wanna do this .
you know who else
loves swimming in those crystal @-@ clear waters ?
nature &apos;s hungriest predator-- the great white shark .
come on . there hasn &apos;t been a shark attack
on the island in forever .
really ? or did they just fail to find the evidence ?
great whites tend to eat their victims .
what ?
this is very , very unlikely to happen .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
i mean , especially if we all die first in ...
a gruesome helicopter crash .
now you see
why the natives call them death birds .
you think you &apos;re gonna be safer driving across country ?
who knows the number one cause of accidental death ?
oh , i do . it &apos;s the car crash .
don &apos;t worry , kids .
we &apos;re gonna hire a professional driver .
it won &apos;t be your dad .
guys , can we go upstairs and talk about this
before we vote ?
you bet .
we await your verdict .
god , you are a hypocrite .
how ?
ten years ago , christmas ,
we are standing in the scooter aisle at the toy store
when i wanna choose the twins &apos; big present .
you say , &quot; tom , when you start making the money ,
you can start making the decisions . &quot;
you &apos;ve been sitting on that for a decade ? wow .
well , guess what . i make the money ,
big money , more money than you ever did ,
so i get to decide how we spend it !
we &apos;re supposed to be equal partners .
i just wanted a say in the pro ...
no , you don &apos;t .
you wanna control the process
like you always do .
watch it .
and then you feel that power slipping away ,
and you can &apos;t stand it .
you can &apos;t stand that i am running the show .
running the show ? are you kidding me ?
we &apos;re talking about a family vacation ...
not anymore ,
we are not !
this is about how you can &apos;t handle my success .
no , you can &apos;t handle your success .
you &apos;ve turned into a pompous ass !
maybe because it &apos;s turned you into a raging bitch .
lee ! i am warning you .
once was funny . this time , i will kill you .
get out of here !
how &apos;s penny ?
really upset .
she kept crying and saying how she didn &apos;t wanna choose .
i don &apos;t care where we go .
we &apos;ll take the road trip .
not the vacation , tom .
she doesn &apos;t wanna choose which one of us to live with .
that is awful . why would she think that ?
why wouldn &apos;t she ? she &apos;s seen it happen to three of her friends .
we have always fought , tom ,
but never like that .
i know . it &apos;s gotta stop .
i agree .
i mean , i &apos;m scared to open my mouth
for fear you &apos;re gonna bite my head off .
i &apos;m sorry . was that an olive branch ?
i &apos;m no better , okay ?
i miss dinner four nights a week ,
and even when i am here ...
my mind is back at the office .
i think we &apos;re the ones who need a vacation .
alone .
yeah .
not a big trip . just a weekend .
we can ... get a chance to be together
and work through all of this .
you &apos;re right .
we should do it this weekend .
you mean it ?
yeah .
i just have to check with the office .
okay .
but we are gonna do it , right ?
you &apos;re not gonna get all
busy at the last minute ?
i said we &apos;ll do it ,
and we &apos;ll do it , okay ?
okay . okay .
hello , susan .
hey , dana . i got you your streamers .
i splurged and bought the good ones--flame @-@ retardant .
good .
oh , my god . are those cookies for the open house ?
oh , well , actually--
you are a lifesaver .
i just had two moms flake out on me .
really ?
uh ... well ...
i thought that might happen , so i baked some just in case .
it &apos;s one of the things that makes a great teacher--
being ready for anything .
thank you .
you know , susan , i haven &apos;t been your biggest supporter ,
but maybe i misjudged you .
thanks for these .
let &apos;s find some time to sit down with principal hobson
and talk about you coming back .
yes !
hello , susan .
come on in .
meals on wheels .
well , shoes .
but &quot; food on shoes &quot; doesn &apos;t sound as good .
today &apos;s special is lasagna .
would you like me to put it on a plate for you ,
or do you wanna eat it later ?
i think i &apos;ll have it now .
in fact , i &apos;d love for you to join me .
oh , i can &apos;t .
acturally , i &apos;m on my way to a function at m.j. &apos; s school .
i &apos;m sure you have a few minutes . sit down .
uh ... i &apos;m kind of in a rush .
but it &apos;s not fair .
you go to all this trouble to bring me
these delicious meals , and we never share them .
it pains me .
uh ... paul , what &apos;s ... going on ?
fine . you &apos;re in a hurry .
why don &apos;t you stab me with this ? it &apos;ll be faster .
or are you getting your kicks watching me die slowly ?
okay , i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
the food you &apos;re bringing me , susan--it &apos;s poisoned .
what ? that &apos;s not possible .
i had it tested . come on . have a bite .
paul .
how could you do this to me ?
is it because you want the house ?
is it--is it because you hate me ?
okay , you have to believe me . i never put poison in your food .
well , somebody did . was it mike ?
no ! it was just me . i @-@ i &apos;m the only one who ...
what ?
oh , my god .
the cookies . i @-@ i &apos;ve gotta go . i &apos;ve gotta get to the school !
oh , cindy , cindy . the desserts--
the desserts , my cookies--
have they put them out yet ?
oh ! yeah .
they &apos;re ... just ...
i &apos;m so sorry . try the oatmeal raisin .
kathy , um , do you know how many points these are ?
you &apos;ll thank me tomorrow .
susan ? what did you do to the parents &apos; council ?
they love you .
oh , great ! thanks for the cookie .
uh , which one of these is--is mine ?
ooh , i have no idea . we just put &apos; em all together .
whoops ! sorry . oh , silly me .
if i can have everyone &apos;s attention
for a moment , please ?
hi . i wanna welcome all our wonderful parents .
and i wanna thank the decorating committee
and those who made the refreshments .
oh , including susan delfino .
thank you , susan , for those chocolate chip cookies .
oh . uh ... you &apos;re welcome .
and about those cookies i made--don &apos;t eat them .
they &apos;re poison .
no , no , this isn &apos;t a joke . my cookies will kill you .
oh , god .
that &apos;s her , officers .
yes , no matter who we are ,
we all experience moments of dread ...
when we ask ourselves ,
will anyone believe i &apos;m innocent ?
will my daughter be a child of divorce ?
will this man break my heart ?
are there things that go bump in the night ?
and sometimes ...
the answer ...
