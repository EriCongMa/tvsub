what happened in the woods ?
toby cavanaugh is dead .
终获自由
somebody killed him . i saw his body .
oh , god .
maggie , i am so sorry .
did pastor ted hire somebody to work on the church ?
i put a five dollar bill in the church collection box ,
it had some dice drawn on it .
and later that day , caleb &apos;s dad had it .
do you really think he would steal from the place
that just hired him ?
there was some trouble with the old badges .
people getting in ? people getting out ?
ezra fitz has applied as a substitute teacher .
i have to ask ,
are you seeing ezra fits ?
no , i &apos;m not .
all i want from you and your mother is that car .
look at all that &apos;s happened since you turned me down
on our little drive up the mountain .
but i believe in second chances . you need me .
you have visitors .
spencer ?
i &apos;ll be in the hall if you need me .
hey . you knew we were coming , right ?
we spoke with your mom .
we wanted to be here the first day .
but she said you were going to be home tomorrow , so ...
she still believes that ?
she thinks that i &apos;ll be able to sleep through the night
if i just take a nice bubble bath and lay in my own bed ?
i think what she wants is
i know what she wants , but
they don &apos;t make a loofa that scrapes out the inside of your head .
the park rangers found a body .
hannah !
what ?
the sooner she knows , the sooner she checks out of this place .
what hannah is trying to say is we have good news .
they found a body in the woods .
the police believe it was a camper .
it was toby .
no , spence , it wasn &apos;t .
this person , he &apos;d been missing for a while
and he was nowhere near where you thought you saw--
i know what i saw .
it was toby .
hey , so , um , i was thinking tomorrow night
when you get home , we could all--
i need to stay here . i need more time .
time for what ?
hannah .
shuffling around in mona &apos;s old slippers
isn &apos;t going to get her any better .
hannah , chill .
you know what ...
i would not dine here , if i were you ,
i had to sneak around in that kitchen ,
and i saw a roach big enough to wear an apron .
moving on .
you are not crazy . this place is .
i &apos;m too tired to have this fight right now , guys .
i feel safe here .
those bars don &apos;t just keep you from getting out ,
they keep other people from getting in .
uh , need a minute .
your friends are leaving . do you want to say good @-@ bye ?
i already did .
have you seen my make @-@ up bag ?
no , but i think everything
that was in it is on my pillow .
okay , don &apos;t start . i only slept for ,
like , 20 minutes .
why do you keep looking out there ?
because wilden knows i &apos;m staying here .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking about ?
i &apos;m having dreams about our friend having her head shaved ,
and you &apos;re looking--
i have lots of other things that are keeping me
up at night , okay emily ?
if that car i dunked suddenly learns how to float , then--
if wilden &apos;s looking for his car ,
then he &apos;s not a.
okay , besides cars don &apos;t float ,
if they did ,
pilgrims could have driven here .
why is there a wet towel on my bed ?
ladies , you better get hopping ,
or you &apos;re not going to have time for breakfast .
oh , none for me , thanks .
you know i love her , but somebody &apos;s got to teach
that girl the word &quot; fold . &quot;
it was a rough night .
honey , look . i know
it &apos;s hard seeing a friend suffer ,
but if the doctor &apos;s think she--
doctors aren &apos;t helping spencer .
okay , she still believes that was toby .
well , you can &apos;t get caught up in that kind of thinking .
don &apos;t take on a tragedy that has nothing to do with you .
mom ! okay , you work at the precinct ,
can you at least tell me when you know more about the body ?
look , if it &apos;ll help you move on from this ,
then yes .
you &apos;ll know when i know .
sure if this is big enough to split ?
i think that we should go sit inside .
we could also eat this in my car
and duck every time somebody walks by .
if i &apos;m telling the principal that we &apos;re not involved ,
i don &apos;t think we should be seen splitting
a cruller on the sidewalk .
we &apos;re not going backwards .
we &apos;ll figure it out .
look ...
nothing between us needs to change .
it &apos;s maggie .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
what time ?
tomorrow ... um , no , i just have a ...
you know what , yeah . i can pick him up .
yep .
what &apos;s going on ?
malcolm &apos;s karate class gets out at the same time
as my second interview .
well , i &apos;d offer to help , i just figured
after the whole falling @-@ off @-@ the @-@ bed incident--
well , you know i don &apos;t blame you for that .
it &apos;s not about me .
so , maggie blames me .
you know what , honestly , i would love it if you picked up malcolm .
if i put off this interview ,
someone else is going to get that job .
well , what are you going to tell maggie ?
i can deal with her .
and what &apos;s even trippier is we both have scars
below our left knee . and , you know , granted ,
my dad got his in prison , but ...
that was a joke .
mmm , what &apos;s that smell ? new perfume ?
no , it &apos;s air freshener .
emily &apos;s mom sprayed it all over my clothes and then ,
when i wasn &apos;t looking , she sprayed it in my hair .
ask her to spritz you tonight .
my dad wants to take us to a nice dinner .
caleb , he does not have to do that .
stop .
look , not only are you the person that
brought him back into my life ,
but you &apos;re the reason he gets to stay in it .
and you got the man work .
let him get you an entree .
can &apos;t you just ask your mom for a copy of the coroner &apos;s report ?
aria , the report doesn &apos;t say not toby ,
it says john doe .
it &apos;s not going to change spencer &apos;s mind .
who &apos;s that ?
um , shana .
why does she keep texting you while paige is out of town ?
is she into you ?
sorry you guys , caleb had a lot to share .
why are you blushing ?
why is she blushing ?
shana &apos;s cruising her , and i think that she should shut it down
before it turns into ex and the city .
guys , i &apos;m not thinking about shana .
we need to help spencer .
no , em , you saw her face .
she &apos;s not getting out of there unless we kidnap her .
or we actually take the
body there and prove to her it isn &apos;t toby .
em , that &apos;s not a real option .
no , but , taking a picture of it is .
and we &apos;ve been to that morgue before ,
what &apos;s stopping us from going back ?
um , do we really have to answer that ?
ever played this one ?
um , no . looks like it &apos;s a bit before my time .
so is duke ellington . if he walks in the door ,
are you going to ask him not to play the piano ?
spencer ? i just learned you &apos;re admitted .
i didn &apos;t know .
eddie , uh , could you check on mr. paterson ?
he may need assistance getting to physical therapy .
he had it this morning .
then , perhaps you could do a follow @-@ up ,
check on his pain management .
how &apos;re you feeling ?
spencer , if there &apos;s anything i said or did that--
no , you &apos;re not the reason that i &apos;m here .
who chose this game ? you or eddie ?
eddie . why ?
he played it with mona , when she first arrived .
yeah , she was a bit obsessed with it ,
until she eventually traded it for cards .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve got to push on .
i &apos;ll check on you later .
okay .
i &apos;ll see you later .
hannah ?
i &apos;ve left your mom several messages
and i haven &apos;t heard back .
is there a better way that i can reach her ?
uh , she &apos;s in new york right now for a training seminar .
why , what &apos;s wrong ?
we just need her to weigh in on a delicate issue .
who &apos;s we ?
mrs. montgomery , what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m on the church &apos;s restoration committee ,
and something &apos;s come up .
wait , is this about caleb &apos;s dad ?
how well did your mom know jamie before she recommended him ?
look , i &apos;m trying to help .
it &apos;s just , it &apos;s really hard to defend the honor
of someone you don &apos;t even know .
i &apos;m hoping it &apos;s all just a big misunderstanding .
and what &apos;s the misunderstanding ?
jamie ... removed the bronze bell from the tower
to have it repaired , but the one that was
returned is evidently of much lesser value .
wait , that &apos;s what this is about ?
they miss their old , crusty bell ?
to the tune of $ 8,000 .
please , don &apos;t say anything to caleb ,
just have your mom call me .
it &apos;s got great bones .
they built these churches to last .
when do they expect you to be done ?
i &apos;m going to take my time .
i want to get this right .
oh , before i forget .
what is this ?
it &apos;s for you .
open it .
it &apos;s an angel .
it seemed appropriate .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
oh , i hate these damn things .
let me turn this off .
actually , it &apos;s pastor ted .
i may have to get this , excuse me .
hello ?
i thought this might make you feel better .
and then maybe on the way home , we can stop--
i &apos;m not coming home .
just at least put on the blouse .
mom , i told you i &apos;m not ready .
well , as soon as you &apos;re in your own bedroom ,
surrounded by your--
look , mom ,
i can &apos;t just go back to dinners at the club .
you don &apos;t have to wear the blazer , just put on the--
i said i &apos;m not ready !
what happened between you and toby ?
i &apos;m not moving from this spot until i get a real answer .
the last time i saw someone in this state ,
clinging to a secret this hard , it was alison .
a few weeks later she was dead .
alison .
where were you ? i thought you were
asleep in spencer &apos;s room .
i had to go out .
for what ?
what happened to your mouth ? it &apos;s bleeding .
i must &apos;ve scratched myself on a tree branch
on my way over to the house .
can i go upstairs , please ?
why did you have to go to your house at three in the morning ?
mrs. hastings , please . i can &apos;t talk about this .
let me get some ice for your mouth . just stay there .
please ?
here .
did you have a fight with someone ?
mrs. hastings , if you tell my parents ,
it &apos;s only going to make it worse .
promise me you won &apos;t say anything .
come here .
i &apos;m just being weird .
overly sensitive . i &apos;m fine .
you never told this to the police ?
of course i did .
but i made up my own mind about who went after her that night
and i kept that to myself .
well , who ?
why ? mom , how could you not say anything ?
because if jason went after us ,
exposing your father as his , too ,
it &apos;d be my family breaking down in the middle of the night .
so , you still believe jason ?
no , i don &apos;t . not anymore .
but i &apos;m starting to wonder about others .
i need to ask .
is toby not the person that we thought he was ?
sorry , guys , i &apos;m going to have to hit the road .
there &apos;s a problem at work i gotta deal with .
what , right now ?
i &apos;ve just been fired .
what--what are you talking about ?
it seems the wrong bell got hung up in the tower ...
i &apos;m gonna have to go down
to the foundry myself and clear this up .
do you want me to come with you ?
no , you guys finish your dinner ,
i &apos;ll sort this out . i &apos;ll see you later .
okay , who am i supposed to text if i see someone ?
me . not hannah .
we &apos;re using her phone to take the picture .
hannah , pay attention .
what ? i &apos;m sorry .
my boyfriend &apos;s dad got nailed for stealing .
where do you sell a hot bell , anyway ?
hannah , focus . i don &apos;t want to be
in there any longer than we have to .
we find john doe , we take the picture ,
and we get out of here .
if it &apos;s bronze , you probably melt it down first .
melt it into what ?
why are we still discussing bells ?
because caleb thinks his dad is a saint ,
and i know he &apos;s selling pieces of our church online .
okay , forget it . i &apos;ll do this alone .
how are we gonna know which one is john doe ?
we have to go through those racks .
um , no . you are going through those racks .
this isn &apos;t a clearance sale , emily ,
and i &apos;m freaking out .
all we &apos;ve done is walk through those doors .
it doesn &apos;t matter ! i smell dead people .
fine , just get your phone ready , okay ?
i &apos;ll hold it , but you have to aim it .
i just want to close my eyes .
god , this is so wrong .
you spend your whole life doing crunches ,
getting rid of tan lines , not eating that second pudding .
and then in the end you &apos;re just a stale loaf of bread
lying on a rack .
um , maybe you can help me with this loaf ,
i can &apos;t find the tag .
wait .
em , what if it really is toby in there ?
it &apos;s not . and spencer needs to know that .
okay , but just in case i don &apos;t know if i can
handle seeing his face . so can we just look for
his tattoo or something ?
it &apos;s not toby
em , someone &apos;s coming .
come on , we have to go .
em , come on !
hi , sunshine .
good book ?
it &apos;s okay .
can i ask you something ?
that game that you wanted to play yesterday ?
i heard it was one of mona &apos;s favorites .
who played it with her ?
i don &apos;t recall .
mona liked to play a lot of games .
yeah , but wren ...
dr. kingston , he said she was
&quot; obsessed &quot; with this one .
well , he would know .
what is with you and him ?
what do you mean ?
eddie , are you the person behind the trouble
with the visitors &apos; passes ?
did you let somebody in who--
it wasn &apos;t me .
was it dr. kingston ?
take your pill .
you may be sleeping , but you don &apos;t look
like you &apos;re getting any rest .
i won &apos;t tell anybody .
trust your instinct . mine told me ,
from the minute that guy got here ,
it wasn &apos;t for the right reasons .
let &apos;s just leave it at that , okay ?
did you get my messages ?
yeah , i &apos;ve been cramming for algebra .
i have a make @-@ up test in , like , ten minutes .
well , my dad &apos;s screwed .
the foundry claims there is no mix @-@ up ,
and they have the paper trail to prove it .
well , maybe if your father spoke to the church committee ,
and told them that--
told them what ?
why should he have to defend himself to a bunch of
small @-@ minded people who think someone is a thief
just because they don &apos;t tuck in their shirt ?
did i press mute or something ?
why are you being so quiet ?
i &apos;m just listening .
you did a lot of that last night , too .
i don &apos;t know what to say , caleb .
since when ? hannah you have an opinion about
everything , from honey boo @-@ boo &apos;s hair cut
to the weird look the lunch lady gave you when
you asked for butter on your corn .
look , i just don &apos;t think that
your dad has changed as much
as much as you think he has .
look , the night that he got the job at the church ,
i put money in the church collection box ,
and when he paid for the pizza , he used that same bill .
how could you possibly know that ?
because there was a pair of lucky dice drawn on it .
it was the same bill , caleb .
hi . excuse me , yeah , i &apos;m here to pick up malcolm .
oh , he was already picked up about ten minutes ago .
he was ? oh , so maggie must have--
oh , no , his mom didn &apos;t come today , it was a friend .
uh , aria montgomery .
something wrong ?
no . no , everything &apos;s fine , thanks .
aria ?
i didn &apos;t know you were coming here tonight .
yeah , i &apos;m came to meet up with ezra and malcolm .
are you all right ?
is maggie here , too ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe .
honey , we talked about this .
and i know you want to make it work , but--
okay , mom , i can &apos;t do this right now .
aria !
you &apos;re going to be the one that gets hurt .
not to mention a confused little boy who &apos;s still wondering
how this stranger is suddenly his father .
he needs help working through it , but not with you .
malcolm already has somebody looking out for him .
i have to go .
be right back , i &apos;m going to drop this off to room 217 .
what is that ?
a book .
one of the patients was asking for it earlier , so--
yes , well , our patient needs her rest .
you can give it to spencer tomorrow .
i &apos;m off tomorrow .
all right , then i &apos;ll give it to her for you .
we &apos;re not having the same problem again , are we , eddie ?
have you heard anything yet ?
nope .
for all i know , he &apos;s already skipped town .
well , i spoke to my mom--
hannah , it &apos;s not up to your mom
or you , or me to dig him out of this .
is this everything ?
yeah , almost . just to find my english book .
all right , i &apos;ll be out front .
i was on my way to your place , and i saw your car out front .
where were you ?
oh , making phone calls ... hey .
was trying to track down a guy who helped me
with the dry wall . and see if he can help ...
help with what ? back up your story ?
what &apos;s his cut ?
what ?
caleb , don &apos;t do this right now .
hey , you should listen to your girlfriend .
i am .
and i believe her when she says this isn &apos;t the first time
that you &apos;ve stolen from that church .
what are we talking about here ?
we aren &apos;t talking . we are done .
last night , you were my defender .
what happened ?
i woke up ,
and i realized that this isn &apos;t
the first time that you &apos;ve screwed me over .
oh , i see .
i &apos;m still that person , huh ?
somehow you managed to forgive your mother &apos;s sins .
don &apos;t suppose it &apos;s got anything to do with that fancy car
she tossed at you .
that has nothing to do with this .
maybe not , but it &apos;s got to be easier to point a finger
at someone with a rusty pick @-@ up and no permanent address .
isn &apos;t that all the proof you needed ?
all the proof that i needed were the ratty hand @-@ me @-@ downs
that i had as a kid .
remember the winter coat that ended at my elbow ?
and the unsigned permission slips ?
and the social workers , and the foster families
who slammed doors in my face
when they were tired of looking at me ?
that is my proof !
yeah .
wow , when you put it that way ...
i guess i wouldn &apos;t believe me , either .
should i call the police ?
yes . wait .
unless you think it will make it worse .
what &apos;s worse ? a &apos;s got ezra &apos;s kid .
i &apos;m just saying , you saw them , malcolm wasn &apos;t hurt .
but if you call the cops , a might--
don &apos;t . just don &apos;t .
okay , i swear , if something happens to that little boy
because of me , i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to do .
aria . walk over to the police station ,
and report it . i &apos;ll meet you there in ten .
malcolm ?
there &apos;s gonna be another show . the man outside said so .
i &apos;m early .
you know , i was supposed
to pick you up from your karate class , right ?
but your friend picked me up instead .
she said her name was alison .
come on , we should go .
your dad &apos;s probably wondering where we are .
emily ?
um , mom , i figured you &apos;d be home by now .
i thought i was clear this morning .
look , i know you want answers , but you can &apos;t be doing this .
go home . we &apos;ll talk about this later .
what &apos;s going on ?
this is not the time .
why are they making you stay late ?
emily , go .
i &apos;ll call you when i &apos;m on my way .
one , two , three , four ...
didn &apos;t your mother have this ?
your mother .
really , i must have left it at your house
and didn &apos;t get it back .
i left a lot of stuff there .
is it just me , or was sixth grade the best year ever ?
i didn &apos;t even know you then .
oh , honey ,
you didn &apos;t even know me when you knew me .
come on , give it up , spence .
let &apos;s pretend that you &apos;re getting ready for
your first boy @-@ girl dance party .
no one ever tells you that the practice
is so much more fun than the real thing .
was it toby ?
was he the one that gave you that bloody lip ?
toby ?
oh , sweetie ,
girls fight much dirtier than boys .
i &apos;m lucky she didn &apos;t leave a scar .
she ? who ?
you stopped dancing .
i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t want to dance .
i &apos;ll change the song .
no , i can &apos;t . i haven &apos;t slept in three days .
come on .
i &apos;m looking for something .
the star on mona &apos;s game board .
oh , that . it &apos;s in there .
spencer .
what are you doing ?
so ...
you &apos;re malcolm &apos;s new hero .
he had a blast tonight .
what did he say ?
ah , not much . maggie said he
mumbled something about puppets ,
and then fell right to sleep .
oh , she asked me to pass along her thanks .
you know , if you keep spoiling him like this ,
he &apos;s not going to want to go with anyone else .
ezra ?
i don &apos;t think that i can do this anymore .
aria , i was kidding .
you won &apos;t have to .
no , i &apos;m saying i don &apos;t think
that i can do this anymore .
what ? what do you mean ?
it isn &apos;t just the two of us now .
and eventually somebody &apos;s going to wind up hurt .
and i &apos;d rather it be me .
i just need to go home .
now ? okay , well then , let me just get a waitress .
no .
you finish , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m going to walk . i think that the air will be good for me .
hey . i &apos;ve had these days .
i promise you things will look different in the morning .
how many times did she visit her ?
what is that ?
mona kept souvenirs .
how many times did cece visit her ?
i wouldn &apos;t know . yes , you would , wren .
you authorized it .
and i was almost suspended for it .
mona was under restriction at that time , no visitors .
and you broke the rules for her because ... ?
cece called me and was desperate to see her .
she thought she could help her .
help her with what ?
recover from the psychic wounds inflicted by your
late friend , alison .
you sure it wasn &apos;t the other way around ?
quite sure . alison pulled some stunt at a frat party
that got cece kicked out of university .
ali ... got cece kicked out of school ?
yeah , cece came out the other side ,
and she thought she could serve as a role model for mona .
and i agreed .
how did she even know that mona was even in here ?
melissa called her .
emily ? is hannah home ?
no . she &apos;s out with caleb , why ?
mom ?
what &apos;s going on ?
why were you carrying that missing person &apos;s file ?
i promised i wouldn &apos;t keep anything from you .
but i have to make sure that you keep this from your friends .
can i have your phone , please ?
what ?
this is very sensitive information ,
if it got out before the police ...
mom . please , what is it ?
they found another body early this evening .
a young man .
late teens , early 20s .
no identification .
what are you saying ?
it could be toby ?
i don &apos;t know .
how can they not know ?
there was significant trauma to the body , emily .
it &apos;s gonna take some time before they &apos;re certain .
we &apos;ll know more tomorrow morning .
do you want to take a walk or something ?
it was stupid .
you gave someone a second chance .
that &apos;s never stupid .
we talked about this road trip we were gonna take .
ride bikes , go out west .
i was already mapping it out .
we can take a trip sometime .
i know it &apos;s not the same , but ...
it would be better .
because i &apos;ll be with someone who i know is looking out for me .
i &apos;ll get us refills .
so , basically a was framing jamie the whole time ?
do you think that bill from the collection box was--
don &apos;t you ?
caleb is never going to forgive me .
where is he now ?
he went to go find jamie .
but even if he does , what is he supposed to tell him ?
he may just have to find a way to tell him the truth .
caleb &apos;s familiar with the workings of a.
so is ezra .
do you plan on telling him
who bought his kid a big , fat balloon today ?
em ?
it was the wrong body .
what ?
the john doe , the one in the mask .
it was the wrong one .
emily , you &apos;re not making sense .
they just found a body tonight ,
in a shallow grave out in the woods .
where ?
exactly where spencer said it was .
they found her purse close by .
look at all that &apos;s happened since you turned me down
on our little drive up the mountain .
but i believe in second chances .
you don &apos;t have to ask me again , mona .
i &apos;m in .
