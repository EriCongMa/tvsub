is this what you &apos;re looking for ?
sometimes things look bad , and they &apos;re really not .
sometimes there &apos;s another explanation for what &apos;s going on .
and what if that explanation is even worse ?
how long has it been since you &apos;ve seen your uncle ?
i only saw him like once or twice a year when i was a kid .
that &apos;s you .
that ring . jamie had the same ring on .
as team captain , i can &apos;t let your slip &apos; n &apos; slide
affect the whole team .
this is not a game to me .
so are we okay ?
we &apos;ll talk soon , okay ?
ezra said i could use the place if he was away .
do we have a problem ?
me staying here for a couple of nights ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
look who else was in cape may that summer .
ali was pregnant .
who would she--
detective wilden .
do you think it was alison in the red coat ?
all i know is that it was a woman ,
and she &apos;s the one in charge .
did she show up to a.p. english ?
was she even here today ?
i think we would know if spencer were here .
people would be running for cover .
what ?
look , she &apos;s hurting , and when people hurt , they lash out .
just ... give her some space .
we have . but she &apos;s living on planet freefall .
have you talked to toby ?
well , i left him a ton of messages .
think we &apos;re going to have to find out
what went down from spencer .
maybe i &apos;ll get some cupcakes and show up at her house .
she doesn &apos;t have the flu .
she doesn &apos;t need ragmags and junk food .
she needs to work through this pain , not cover it .
hmm . okay , dr. hannah .
pretty sure when you and caleb broke up ,
you locked yourself in your bedroom for two weeks ,
and all you ate was eskimo pies .
they were skinny cows , and it was four days .
besides , i &apos;m not spencer .
i would ditch school for a hang nail .
yeah , well , i &apos;m going over there .
you need to tell her what you remember
about the blonde in the red coat .
and give her a riddle , she needs to use
that part of her brain again .
yeah , and tell her i think i saw her too .
back up , saw who ?
when i went into that fake interview ,
i could have swore i saw a blonde girl in a red coat
staring at me across the street .
no , i practiced by myself !
this is a team , spencer .
and you weren &apos;t thinking about the team
when you didn &apos;t show up for practice .
were those her words ?
look , am i on this team or not ?
not . we took a vote .
well , you can &apos;t stop me from going to lewisburg tonight .
look , why don &apos;t you just reapply for the spring ?
okay ? ben &apos;s graduating early .
hey , mona .
is there anything else that you want to take away from me ?
i &apos;ve got this .
spencer , mona &apos;s been on that team for like 15 minutes .
she can &apos;t get away with that .
she just did .
listen , i have to go to work ,
but why don &apos;t i come over after
and we can pick up where we left off .
no , i really ... i can &apos;t do this , please , not here .
我再搞定剩下三个中的一个 -a
what if we talked to the teacher who coaches the decathlon team ?
you had her for social studies , what &apos;s her name ?
hannah ? hannah ?
why are you mapquesting amish country ?
i &apos;m looking for a stable .
our best friend is at home chewing her elbows
and you &apos;re horse shopping ?
no , i &apos;m trying to find out where caleb &apos;s uncle jamie works .
hannah , please let that go .
people look like their uncles .
it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s his dad .
look , there were other things , okay ?
so ?
look , even if it is the truth ,
why would you want to know before caleb ?
hello , learn from my mistakes .
this is different .
maggie didn &apos;t want ezra to meet his kid .
jamie wants to tell him . he just doesn &apos;t know how .
and you know this because ... ?
i saw it in his eyes when he handed me that baby picture .
are you going to come with me ?
no . you &apos;re not going to go there either .
horowitz !
what ?
the coach . that &apos;s her name .
i &apos;ll just have my mom talk to her .
is that your mom ?
no , it &apos;s ezra &apos;s .
oh , my god , why is she calling me ?
we &apos;re not friends .
hello ? oh , hi .
no , i don &apos;t know . i haven &apos;t been in ezra &apos;s apartment .
yeah , well , i doubt that wes has been hiding out there .
if i see him , i &apos;ll let--
why does she think little fitz is hiding out at big fitz &apos;s ?
&apos;cause he is .
cece ?
omg , i never texted you back .
no , that &apos;s okay .
um , can i stop by later ?
i gotta run . i &apos;m meeting some photographer i hired
for the store &apos;s website . everything okay ?
i , uh ... need to ask you something .
you know darren wilden , right ?
he was a couple years ahead of you in school .
he might be &quot; the hottie &quot;
that alison was talking about in that notebook .
and we think he might &apos;ve been in cape may the summer .
yeah , him and about four million other delta @-@ phi &apos;s .
and they all wanted to rush ali .
but if he knew her and now he &apos;s on her case ,
don &apos;t you think that ...
i don &apos;t have time to think .
if i don &apos;t get this website up , i won &apos;t have a job .
i &apos;ll talk to you soon , hon .
hey . busy ?
yeah . i was just about to put out a new
doormat that said &quot; go away . &quot;
spencer , i know how valuable you are to the team ,
but there &apos;s a hundred @-@ year war going on
between you and mona , and it &apos;s a distraction .
we need to be thinking of one thing : winning this title .
you were the swing vote , weren &apos;t you ?
look , we can &apos;t afford internal tension .
war &apos;s a game that has to be played with a smile .
stop quoting mona .
that &apos;s winston churchill .
well , he sounds a lot like mona .
and you know damn well that without me ,
you &apos;re going to be annihilated in world history .
think we &apos;ve got it covered .
by whom ?
by me .
okay .
andrew , you want me to practice ? let &apos;s do it .
but if i win , you rescind your vote
and you put me back on the team .
i can &apos;t do that .
yes , you can .
spencer , even if i could ,
how do i know you &apos;re not gonna flake on us again ?
well , i guess that you don &apos;t know that for sure .
but everything in life is a risk ,
and you like to gamble .
new rules .
for every question that i get wrong ,
i will take off a piece of clothing .
same thing goes for you .
and the match isn &apos;t over until one of us is butt naked .
you &apos;re out of control .
not yet .
jamie ?
hannah ?
what are you doing back up here ?
oh , i was looking for a farmer &apos;s market ,
and then i remembered you that worked nearby ,
and when i got there , they told me--
hannah .
you didn &apos;t drive two hours for a shoo @-@ fly pie .
what &apos;s up ?
you &apos;re his father . right ?
does he know ?
i &apos;m not sure .
when i floated the idea around , he kinda just shut me down .
is there a reason that you can &apos;t tell him ?
look ...
i &apos;ve got a long history of disappointing people .
i &apos;d rather not pass on my problems--
no , he can deal with it .
hanna , i &apos;ve taken a lot of shortcuts .
my resume &apos;s not gonna put
me in the running for daddy of the year .
okay , well , what does that mean , &quot; shortcuts &quot; ?
well , for starters , a police record .
you were in jail ?
it was a long time ago . and i didn &apos;t kill anyone ,
so get that look off your face .
i served time for petty theft .
caleb &apos;s better off thinking of me as the
crazy @-@ ass uncle who climbed the fence
at veterans stadium to grab him a baseball .
no , he &apos;s not . he wants you in his life .
you &apos;re his father .
caleb will meet you halfway .
this document , which formalized the end of world war i ,
was originally known ...
treaty of versailles .
this proponent of establishing a nation
to which former slaves could return to africa--
abraham lincoln .
wrong .
marcus garvey .
this bloody conflict between the spartans and athenians
lasted for nearly three decades--
the trojan war .
wrong . peloponnesian .
is that ? holy crap , it &apos;s emily fields .
relax . you &apos;re not her type .
uhh ... should i have brought more cupcakes ?
no , thanks . i &apos;m leaving .
hi , emily .
what ? just trying to get my spot on the team back .
by doing what ?
well , i was about to show andrew my cupcakes .
since when do you have to get naked to get what you want ?
since politely discussing my intellectual prowess
wasn &apos;t exactly swaying his vote .
okay , spencer , you &apos;re way too smart to play dumb .
first you drop that bomb on jason , which , by the way ,
now i &apos;m gonna have to un @-@ drop .
and then you jump on the first guy that walks in here
just to get back at toby--
this has nothing to do with toby .
mona &apos;s the enemy , remember ?
that hasn &apos;t changed . but you have .
and if you or toby don &apos;t tell me what is going--
you spoke with him ?
no !
don &apos;t !
why not ? he &apos;s my friend , too .
no , we are not his friends .
why ? what could he have possibly done that is so unforgivable ?
y @-@ y @-@ you can &apos;t understand .
really ? because i haven &apos;t lost someone who i deeply love ?
you don &apos;t have a monopoly on pain , spencer .
everybody has their fair share .
okay , but we get through it because we have each other !
and your friends are not gonna stand here and watch--
watch me what ? not be spencer hastings anymore ?
clearly , that &apos;s not working out for me .
so please just get good with this , emily .
this is the new me !
whoa , are you moving in , or are you moving out ?
out .
all right .
i don &apos;t think that pot &apos;s disposable .
there &apos;s very little pot left . it &apos;s mostly black oatmeal .
yeah , well , you might miss it .
don &apos;t worry , my mother will go through the trash
after i &apos;m outta here .
let her replace it .
right ...
she called me today . she was looking for you .
oh , she found me . at 7 a.m.
paid the super for a spare key and woke me up .
wait . if she knew you were here this morning ,
why would she call me this afternoon ?
to test you . trap you .
prove to ezra that you &apos;re a liar .
god , she is so hateful .
did i just say that out loud ?
so , you headed back to prep school ?
nope , i was officially banished .
where are you gonna finish your senior year ?
who knows ? spain maybe . halifax .
halifax ? why there ?
i have a friend who works up there at a marine center .
they save seals and track whales .
it &apos;s an awesome place .
i think i &apos;d love to do something like that .
that &apos;s cool .
why don &apos;t you just stay here till you figure things out ?
can &apos;t afford to keep changing the locks .
i &apos;ll just crash on my buddy &apos;s couch in philly tonight .
i &apos;m just gonna leave that for ezra .
have you heard from him ?
no . have you ?
yeah , mostly texts .
the last time i talked to him ,
he was at malcolm &apos;s soccer game .
with maggie .
hey , i wouldn &apos;t read too much into that .
tell her i &apos;m in canada .
hey , cece , what &apos;s up ?
please tell me you &apos;re stilling working for that photographer .
i am . why ?
i hired some dork off a bogus website
who showed up to shoot photos with his phone .
idiot . any chance you could grab
some decent equipment and help me with this tonight ?
i &apos;ll pay you . i &apos;ll spring for dinner .
please ?
is there any chance i can bring an assistant ?
i never asked you for your help .
you know what , i just saw him last week .
if i wanted to get into this , i would &apos;ve .
you didn &apos;t even question it until i brought it up .
hannah , it &apos;s not like the possibility never crossed my mind .
okay , and if it is true ,
it &apos;s even more reason for me not to meet him .
why ?
maybe i &apos;m not ready , okay ?
maybe i &apos;m not in the place where you want me to be .
maybe you should stop poking around in areas
in my life where you weren &apos;t invited !
okay , i didn &apos;t invite you to go hunting down &quot; a &quot; behind my back .
hannah , i did that out of love and concern for you .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m doing this !
look , he just wants to talk to you .
okay , even as your uncle , you should give him a chance .
it &apos;s just a cup of coffee , you can throw it on him if you want .
you know what , you go , okay ?
he had a lot of days where he could have made this choice ,
and he didn &apos;t .
instead , he let me grow up on my own .
and that &apos;s where i am .
i &apos;m grown up , and i &apos;m on my own .
so i &apos;m saying , &quot; no . &quot;
well , he &apos;s really looking forward to this , so ...
guess i &apos;ll just be there without you .
great . let me know how it works out .
what &apos;s he so angry about ?
his father .
hey . what are you doing back here ?
i wanted to talk to you about what spencer said at the cemetery .
you going to tell me she made that up-- ali being pregnant .
come on , emily , that wasn &apos;t breaking news to any of you .
it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s true , just because cece said it .
cece ? is that who set her up with wilden ?
no . she doesn &apos;t even know him . i asked .
i just thought it was weird seeing a picture of wilden up
in cape may .
whoa , whoa , whoa , what picture ?
where &apos;d you see this ?
police station .
wilden and a few of his buddies holding up a fish .
on a boat ?
uhh , it &apos;s more of a dock . why ?
alison made my dad this collage ,
and there was a picture of her on a boat .
what if it was wilden &apos;s ?
jason , you can &apos;t ask him .
okay , if he is trying to hide something , it could hurt you .
don &apos;t bring up what spencer said .
it &apos;s too late . i already called him .
what ? what did he say ?
nothing . yet . i left a message .
would sure help , though , if i were armed with more proof .
where is that picture of ali ?
probably in some box in my dad &apos;s new office .
can i see it ?
do you want some lemon juice on your broccoli ?
yeah , sure .
oh , we have to call mom and dad before it gets too late .
they &apos;re five hours ahead in london .
yeah , sure .
why is wren here ?
did you call him ?
what ? no .
ahh , melissa .
hello .
hi . i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d--
i &apos;m sure you didn &apos;t .
i heard you were back in school ,
finishing your degree .
i am . it &apos;s taking longer than i expected .
right , well , you &apos;ve been distracted , life and all that .
hello , spencer .
hi . what are you doing here ?
i think i &apos;ll dine out back .
we should catch up sometime .
yeah .
really , what are you doing here ?
i got a call
from someone who was concerned about your state of mind .
so you &apos;re making house calls now ?
i &apos;m not here as a professional .
damn it . i was really hoping for some shock therapy ,
but maybe you could just wire me to a toaster
and press &quot; top brown only . &quot;
spencer , save it . i &apos;ve seen this sort of unraveling before and--
and i &apos;m what ? what is the crisis , really ?
that i took my bra off at four in the afternoon ?
please tell emily that i don &apos;t need supervision .
i never spoke to emily , and i didn &apos;t hear anything about a bra .
so what , she told hannah ?
aria ?
i didn &apos;t speak to any of them .
who did you speak with ?
mona ?
mona sent you here , didn &apos;t she ?
spencer , she recognizes self @-@ destructive , aggressive behavior .
if someone had intervened on her behalf ,
she might not have ended up in radley .
yeah . yeah , you &apos;re right .
it was actually really thoughtful of her to send you .
yeah . it was indeed .
and if want , i can refer you to someone--
what i really want is just to get out of the house .
do you think that maybe we could just ...
go to , like , dinner and a movie ?
a date wasn &apos;t exactly--
no , it &apos;s not a date !
it &apos;s a mental health outing .
but i am not going to go with my doctor .
oh , let &apos;s go to that film festival up in bucknell .
where is that ?
it &apos;s up near lewisburg . it &apos;s really not that far .
just give me a second to change .
hey , jamie . it &apos;s hannah .
um ... i was just wondering if maybe you were , um ...
you know what , never mind .
you &apos;re probably already on your way down there .
so , um , i &apos;ll see you soon .
um , if you &apos;re still heading to the brew ,
can i join ?
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m going to be able to deal with this ...
but i know it &apos;s going to be a lot easier if you &apos;re with me .
i &apos;m with you .
do you want me to call him again ?
no .
maybe he misunderstood .
maybe he thought i meant tomorrow .
or next friday .
hannah , he had a hard enough time being there for me as an uncle .
okay , when i was six , he left me with a babysitter .
i had babysitters . my mom was out all the time .
right , but she came back .
eventually the sitter called the police .
that was such a treat .
answering questions , in my pajamas ,
about uncle jamie in a squad car .
he &apos;s not the same person .
really ?
well , you tell that to the empty chair .
let &apos;s go .
just wait . five more minutes .
please ?
it would be great if you had something round ,
a little tarnished , like a ... old teapot .
there might be something in the basement .
you want me to go check ?
would you ?
thanks , love .
i &apos;m good .
is big brother as yummy as little brother ?
ah , lucky girl !
you got two for one .
i &apos;ve got one .
he &apos;s out of town .
he &apos;s dealing with some family stuff .
are you and your man good ?
fine . why do you ask that ?
well , i mean , you shouldn &apos;t be free on a friday night .
you know what they say , you can &apos;t be with the one you love ...
i , uh , couldn &apos;t find a teapot ,
but i found some other cool stuff .
that &apos;s even better .
i &apos;m going to go hunt down some dinner .
can we just get this to go ?
yeah . i &apos;ll get a box .
where have you been ?
the trip was longer than i thought .
what do you want ?
anything decaf .
we were just about to leave .
i wouldn &apos;t blame you if you had .
can you stick around for a few more minutes ?
mmm , that looks good !
they give you a discount on used cake ?
it was ours . we had to eat something to soak up all this tea .
right .
um , i &apos;d get you a fresh piece ,
but if i stand up again , it &apos;s to pee .
and i would rather do that in my pants than leave you two alone .
classy girl .
i &apos;m so proud .
it &apos;ll take me a sec . i know where the keys are .
what is all this ?
looks like someone &apos;s offering me a drink .
is this some kind of sick joke ?
yeah , or how wilden returns phone calls .
who would do all this ?
unbelievable .
would you mind grabbing that other trashcan ?
this is freaking crazy .
i don &apos;t believe this .
you sure we haven &apos;t gone too far ?
we &apos;re fine . i saw a sign back there .
what , to new hampshire ?
trust me . it &apos;ll be worth it .
oh , i love this song .
well , i hope she wasn &apos;t planning on drinking this for dinner .
where is dinner ? she &apos;s been gone a long time .
probably wants us to finish this by the time that she gets back .
you know what , i need some more overhead light .
uh , what about this ?
looks pretty heavy .
hey , i &apos;ve lifted things way heavier than this .
once had to carry my prom date over my shoulder .
nice !
okay , this is way heavier than amber tarsen .
when did that happen ?
no , don &apos;t use that . get some paper towels and some spot remover .
whoa , how &apos;d it get bigger ?
it likes water .
i know i packed that picture myself .
when did your dad move here ?
it &apos;s been a while .
i think the move
was more about leaving rosewood than anything else .
i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s in one of these boxes .
that must &apos;ve been hard . back there .
who do you think would do something like that ?
honestly ?
alison .
but i don &apos;t think she &apos;s visiting us from beyond the grave , so ...
i have no idea .
i do .
jason , i know you think of mona as a friend ,
but she spent two years pulling stunts like that on us .
mona is not a friend , emily . she &apos;s a link .
to what ?
i &apos;m pretty sure she knows who dug up my sister &apos;s remains .
and you think she &apos;ll tell you ?
well , she hasn &apos;t yet ...
but i &apos;m getting warmer .
you &apos;re back .
where &apos;s caleb ?
with his dad .
they probably didn &apos;t even notice that i left .
so , it went well ?
very well .
hey , did pastor ted hire someone to work on the church ?
i don &apos;t know .
although this time ,
i think he &apos;ll probably look for someone
who doesn &apos;t list his mother as a reference .
why ?
well , he should use jamie .
mom , he &apos;s building a stable from scratch .
he can fix a bell tower .
let &apos;s just give him a reason to stay in rosewood for a while--
slow down .
look , it &apos;s a win @-@ win situation for everyone .
okay , just ask .
please , caleb really wants this .
caleb or you ?
well , this is about caleb .
is this it ?
yeah .
why would ali give this to your dad ?
typical ali move .
strolled in one day at dawn . father went ballistic .
this was her apology .
that &apos;s the one .
whose hand is that ... on ali &apos;s shoulder ?
wilden . you check the other side ?
cece told you she didn &apos;t know ?
why did she lie ? is she protecting him ?
might be protecting herself .
why ?
maybe they had their own thing going on .
maybe she planned on meeting up with him that night .
what night ?
the last night my sister was alive .
ali ?
ali !
jason , when police were questioning you about that night ,
why wouldn &apos;t you just tell them ?
i never trusted that &apos;s what i really saw .
besides , if i had told them ,
that would have meant i was awake , even for a minute .
and that would have made me a suspect .
melissa gave you a curfew ?
she probably wishes that she could .
uh , no , i just have to email my parents .
it &apos;s too late to call them .
but will you go in and get us a table ,
and i &apos;ll be right in ?
yeah .
thank you .
umm ... hello .
hi !
what are you doing here ?
oh , andrew , i didn &apos;t recognize you in clothes .
you know you can &apos;t be here .
relax , moose . i &apos;m not here to see you .
uh , spencer , what a surprise !
you know , the match isn &apos;t until tomorrow .
i know , i just wanted to get up here super early ,
so i could get a v.i.p. seat .
i promise i will not eat into your practice .
i just wanted to wish the team captain good luck .
hello , spencer .
did i hear you came all this way just to get a good seat ?
two seats , actually .
i &apos;m , uh , here with wren .
we booked a room .
i really want to thank you
for sending the good doctor to my rescue .
i only called him because you--
oh , no , mona , we know why you called him .
he gives really good intervention .
actually part of my treatment plan
requires me to read a case study
all about a deeply disturbed teenager .
wren seems to refer to her as &quot; m , &quot;
but we both know that this sociopath
goes by other initials as well .
sounds riveting .
but if you &apos;ll excuse me--
i do wonder , though , how anonymous this patient can stay
once i upload the entire case study on the internet
with your photo attached .
and whose looking cray @-@ cray now , spencer ?
have you completely lost it ?
is that why toby left you ?
according to your records , toby was never with me .
but my friends still are , mona ,
and you &apos;re not taking away any more of them .
and yet i don &apos;t see any of them here with you now .
do you still have any friends , spencer ?
die !
just stop !
oh , my god , look at that .
spencer !
get off her !
fine !
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s fine , she just ...
she snapped . i &apos;m okay .
she is definitely gonna know that we moved this .
we &apos;ll tell her we did it for a great shot .
wes , wait , there &apos;s ...
there &apos;s gotta be a better solution .
there is , i &apos;ll just sleep on the stain
instead of the backseat of my car .
oh , what happened to the guy in philly ?
there is no guy in philly .
you don &apos;t have a place to stay tonight .
aria , i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re not .
stay at my place .
no , i--
yes .
okay , you &apos;ll sleep on our couch .
hey , cece , where are you ?
don &apos;t ask . i went to the bar to wait for the food ,
i had one glass of wine , maybe two ,
and i come out and they towed my friggin &apos; car .
where are you ?
do you need us to come get you ?
no , i &apos;m okay .
i found a credit card that won &apos;t bounce .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll get my car back at some point .
how are you guys ?
oh , we &apos;re great !
a little starved , but we &apos;re finished .
and i &apos;ll e @-@ mail you the jpegs .
excellent ! i &apos;m sorry tonight was such a bust .
i owe you big time .
bye .
bye .
okay , we &apos;re all done .
let &apos;s pack up and get out of here . we can eat at my place .
aria , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m fine in my car , all right ?
i &apos;ve slept in the backseat before .
wes , i &apos;ve seen your car . you can &apos;t even find your backseat .
come on .
they &apos;ve been up there a long time .
that &apos;s a good thing .
means that pastor ted likes his ideas .
or he &apos;s freaked that jamie got paid
at his last job in weed .
was this too much in one day ?
i don &apos;t know , i just thought that
you guys were down the street , and--
no .
no , it &apos;s smart .
and who knows when he would have ...
made it back down here .
he probably thinks i &apos;m the pushiest person ever .
actually , he thinks that you &apos;re remarkable .
he thinks i &apos;m the luckiest person ever .
you &apos;re welcome .
