Maura, what time is Jane's doctor's appointment tomorrow?
I forgot to write it down.
I forgot to tell you you don't need to cover it.
I can take her after all.
I thought tomorrow was the first day
of your seminar at BCU.
It was, um, but I realized that as a doctor,
I am best poised to ensure the quality of your medical care.
You could go to your class. We'll be fine.
I've given birth to three kids, and...
I've got enough poise for one O.B. Appointment.
Okay.
Shall we?
Not so fast, Professor.
Why are you trying to get out of teaching this class?
I told you --
Because of my love and devotion for you above all else.
Nope, didn't sell it. What's up?
I... The department head --
He told me that he is so excited about my syllabus
that he wants it to be a course for credit.
Okay, how is that bad news?
I'll have to give grades.
Yeah, I don't want that burden on my shoulders.
I'm still scarred
over the A-minus biochemistry incident in 1996.
I can't even imagine just crushing the spirit
of young, budding minds like that.
Your budding mind was hardly crushed,
and it's med school.
The budding minds of today will have patients tomorrow.
So...grade hard, save lives.
Hello?
Yes, Governor. Hello.
H-h-how can I help you?
Of course I understand.
Thank you, Governor. Okay.
If he wants his nephew to get an "A" in your course,
Say no...at least until the second offer.
He wants me to facilitate a death certificate.
Chelsea Rothsburgher passed away last night. Cancer.
I guess they were close.
Would you like to come with me, or should I take my own car?
Well, how long does facilitating take?
If I'm just signing, 15 minutes.
Yeah, all right. I'll take you.
That would be great. Thanks.
Uh, you do understand that this is a favor the governor.
Yes, I was right here when he asked you a minute ago.
That means no "Downton abbey" jokes.
Okay, no problem.
You promise?
I promise...
Milady.
That's a little unnecessary.
Oh, shoot!
What's wrong?
I left my monocle in the car.
You didn't last 30 seconds.
Well, what am I supposed to do if I get surprised?
Normally, I would gasp,
And the monocle would pop out of my eye socket.
Very funny.
But your snarky remarks are rife with errors.
It's your eye orbit, not socket.
And while monocles were very common in the 1880s,
by 1912,
when "Downton abbey" Takes place,
Upper-class men wore glasses due to advances in optometry,
allowing for better measurement of refractions.
So the joke is on you.
Really?
Oh, and the reason you don't know that
is because you've never stayed awake long enough
to see one full episode.
It's called meditating. It's how I focus.
You've never respected that.
The puddle of drool makes it hard.
She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer two years ago.
If you have questions, I know every aspect
of her medical history and care.
Thank you.
And, as I said, I have prepared her death certificate,
So you just need to sign it.
I'm almost done.
The President used it...
to sign the "No child goes hungry" bill.
She was a very impressive woman.
I worked for her for 20 years.
I'm -- I'm so sorry for your loss.
Jane.
Excuse me.
I can't sign the death certificate.
Well, there's a very fancy pen over there
if yours isn't working.
Her bedclothes are soaked with sweat,
and there are fresh bite marks inside her mouth,
indicating violent seizures.
I don't know how she died,
but I know it wasn't the cancer that killed her.
Well, then, you need to do an autopsy.
Well, in a perfect world,
but there are certain sensitive hierarchical issues.
Because Dr. Elbow Patches over there
is the chief medical examiner
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?
No, wait.
You are. Problem solved.
Dr. Isles, are you quite finished?
Yes. Thank you.
I am afraid this is a suspicious death,
and I'm ordering an autopsy.
You can't do that.
I am the chief medical examiner, so I respectfully disagree.
I'm...Detective Jane Rizzoli, Boston homicide.
Um, if you're quite finished, we'll take it from here.
I'm calling the Governor!
Great!
Do it outside. This is now a crime scene.
See, if he was wearing a monocle,
we would know if he was shocked or horrified.
Now we can only suspect.
How many times has he called?
By my count, a lot.
27, to be exact.
All right, well, if he hasn't already
sent a governor's aide over here to shut you down,
he will do so very soon.
So you almost done?
Uh, yes. I'm moving as fast as I can
while still following protocol.
I've ruled out seizures due to heart attack,
epilepsy, stroke,
meningitis, encephalitis, and toxoplasmosis.
There's one other possibility.
And instead of testing for that, you're gonna buy a goldfish?
No, I'm setting up a variation of the pyrogallol test.
Okay, how much time do you
need before the fish tank is up and running?
I need a few minutes.
Okay. You got it.
What are you going to do?
You don't want to know.
Jane.
Yeah?
Thank you.
For what?
The...plausible deniability, the support, the friendship.
You're welcome.
Hello?
Yes, can you connect me
to the medical examiner's office, please?
Excuse me?
No, I'm trying to place a call.
Who are you?
Really, you expect me to believe that the governor answers phones
at the medical examiner's office?
Chelsea Rothsburgher's net worth is in the hundreds of millions.
Her husband, Larry Sr., was a financial genius.
He started his company with $1,000 and a copy machine.
He died in '05.
Used to be king of the tabloids.
So, who had easy access to the house?
Household staff and her two sons.
We've got uniforms setting up interviews right now.
Are we pushing hard or hardly pushing?
Until we get a cause of death, somewhere in between.
Okay.
Just pranked the governor for...whatever this is.
I'm gonna put Chelsea's heart in the water,
and then I'm gonna remove the clamp from the pulmonary artery.
And if my suspicions are correct,
we'll know right away.
You ready?
For what?
To bask...in the wonder
that is scientific experimentation together.
Or individually.
Here we go.
That is...wow!
You see what I mean?
I'm still basking.
Di-- what do the bubbles mean?
Uh, well, first off,
in a kinetic and spectroelectrochemistry study...
Nope.
Uh, the mechanism of red oxidation...
Nope squared.
The release of gas bubbles indicate
that there was air in Chelsea's heart.
All right, that's my girl.
Hell, no.
So, what caused the embolism?
Uh, well, Chelsea wasn't much of a deep-sea diver,
so somebody must have injected her with an empty syringe.
To make it look like she died of natural causes.
Precisely.
Why would someone murder a woman...
that was already on her death bed?
Chelsea's lawyer sent over a copy of her will.
He said she contacted him three weeks ago.
To set up an appointment to make an addendum,
and then she called a few days later and canceled.
What kind of addendum?
She didn't tell him.
He wasn't sure if she wanted to add a bequest
or cut someone out of the will entirely.
I just talked to the maid, Polly, and she said that a--
Excuse me.
Can I help you?
We're doing a software upgrade.
They told me to just sit anywhere. Am I in your way?
You're kind of in someone else's chair.
Oh, sorry. I didn't realize.
So, anyway, Polly said Chelsea met individually
with her sons and everyone on the staff
right after she started hospice care.
She said her goodbyes and told them
that she'd take care of them after she died.
According to the will,
Every person on the staff is getting a lump sum.
Holy zeros! That's more than the pension we'll get for our 20.
For all of us combined.
What do the sons get?
A lot.
After some charitable bequests,
the remainder of the estate is divided between them.
Are you thinking someone was upset by their share of the pie?
No, I think someone was so desperate for that money,
they couldn't wait to get their hands on it.
医学院
Let me get that.
Here.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
Hi. Jack.
Hello. I'm Dr. Maura Isles.
I'm teaching a seminar in forensic science.
First time?
I wasn't sure if there was any, um, audiovisual, uh, system,
So I just brought everything.
All you need is a password for the wireless system.
Do you have a laptop?
Uh, yes. I do.
Here we go.
All right.
There we go.
Oh. I'm very impressed.
I'm just gonna run a quick test
to make sure the electrical system
has recovered from this morning.
Oh, w-why? What happened?
Some idiot teacher got fed up with the texting and twittering
and went overboard with the visuals
to try to get the students' attention.
And did it work?
Yep! You bet -- for two whole minutes.
Then, um...
In retrospect, a laser show and 3-D holograms
was one gigawatt too many.
I just started my lecture on mechanical engineering,
And the whole building blacked out.
Oh, you're -- you're a teacher here.
You thought I was the A.V. guy?
What? No. No, I didn't.
Yes, I totally did. I am so sorry.
Don't be. Don't be.
It means I'm not annoying and pretentious...yet.
Um, thank you so much for your help.
Anytime.
It was fun.
Break a leg.
Chelsea paid her people well.
The chef, the butler, and Polly all own property
and have solid credit.
The chauffeur's the only one who can't live within his means.
What've we got?
Uh, we got a chauffeur with a cash-flow problem.
Brad Oskoff.
He has expensive tastes and 15 grand in credit-card debt to show for it.
He only pays the minimum every month,
so eventually he'll drown in compounded interest.
"Eventually" is not worth killing over.
What about the kids?
Larry jr. -- successful businessman.
Built his company from the ground up
without taking a cent of his family's money.
Like father, like son.
On the other hand, the younger son, Kalter,
is 28, still lives at home,
and recently just got back from his 11th stint in rehab.
Well, I doubt he abstains from the family fortune.
Chelsea kept him heavily supervised.
No access to cash without the approval of his sobriety counselor.
What's his drug of choice?
Heroin.
Well, if he's using again,
he needs money, and I mean right now.
The Rothsburgher Mansion must be full of stuff
that a pawn-shop owner would salivate over.
Let's get a list of Chelsea's valuables
from the insurance company,
see if anything's missing.
Hey.
Hi, guys.
Hey, ma.
Ah, ma! I -- I forgot!
I forgot about the doctor's appointment. I'm sorry.
I got to reschedule.
Jane, it'll only take an hour.
Come on. Let's go. It's important.
Okay, well, then maybe I'll -- I'll --
I'll try for a Saturday appointment.
I wrote the number down.
All right, I'll reschedule it for you.
That would be fantastic.
Why are you doing this?
A "Thank you" would suffice.
You're right. Thank you.
No, Ma!
Not in front of people!
You're very welcome.
Thank you all so much.
Thank you. Nice to meet you.
Thanks. Thank you.
Thank you.
You were great.
You think so?
I... I thought I completely botched the section
on the importance of statistics and DNA matching.
That has nothing to do with teaching.
People just don't understand statistics.
Well, I-I must say that being in front of a class --
It's, um, invigorating.
It's like being a rock star...
Without the screaming fans or the money.
But I'm -- I'm dreading the grading part.
Mm, it's the worst.
When I was a T.A.,
I used to throw up before and after I turned my grades in.
Oh, what did you do to change that?
It just got easier over time.
I still dread it,
but I don't throw up my guts anymore,
So that's progress.
I guess I was hoping there was a way I could fix that.
Probably not.
I don't think feelings can be fixed.
Well, if you need any more unhelpful advice,
I'll be around.
Thanks. I'm always looking for the least-helpful advice.
Well, let me help you with this.
Thank you.
Would you...
want to get a coffee with me?
I'd love to.
Great.
Someone swipes my mom's necklace,
of course you think it's me.
Was it?
Are you crazy?
I don't know people who could move a piece like that.
So that's your defense --
You wouldn't know how to unload it?
No. My defense is I didn't do it.
How many times have you said,
"It wasn't me," or, "I'm not using"?
What do you think, a thousand?
I'm sober 74 days.
I don't care if you believe that.
You don't know anything about me.
Well, you have a disease that's hard to deal with.
Most people don't think it's a disease.
What about your mother?
Was she like most people?
No, she wasn't like anybody else in the world,
even after...everything, she still believed in me.
I don't know why.
Was she worried about you having access to your inheritance?
She said to put it in a trust.
I can't access it till I'm sober a year.
That's not in the will.
You think I killed my mother
'cause I couldn't wait six months to get her money?
The last thing I want in the world is my inheritance.
And you expect us to believe that?
I'm an addict.
That money will kill me,
and not one person will be surprised...
least of all me.
Thank you for checking.
Insurance company confirms that the diamonds in the necklace
were individually marked with an I.D. Code.
So no breaking it down to sell the stones.
And it looks like Kalter was right.
Nobody tried to pawn it.
Well, not worth the hassle.
The insurance company would spend hundreds of man hours
tracking it down.
The pawn-shop owner would end up
on the wrong side of a stolen-property charge.
Detective Korsak.
I bet you were shocked and appalled, indeed.
Well, thank you very much.
One of the auction houses.
They took the necklace at consignment.
They're faxing over a still from the security video
of the guy that brought it in.
Shocked and appalled?
Yeah, claimed they had no idea that stolen property was there
at such a prestigious establishment.
You buy that?
Not for a second, but I am trying to be less cynical.
That's Larry Rothsburgher.
Now, that is the kind of stuff
that makes it hard for me not to be cynical.
My mother asked me to sell the necklace months ago.
I just forgot.
But...I'm glad you guys called me in
so I could help sort it out.
Well, we're glad you're glad,
'cause there's just a few other things
we need your help with.
Yeah, anything.
We were wondering why a guy
who built his business with his own money --
Yeah, never took a dime of the family's money.
Self-made man, just like my dad.
Right, yeah, you -- you've said that a lot.
Actually, I've checked -- you've -- you've said that
in every interview you've ever done.
And we looked into your company's finances,
and selling that necklace
would buy you a few weeks, at best.
Well, if you have something to say...
Say it.
Your company's crashing.
Your reputation as a businessman is going down with it.
Getting that inheritance would stop that.
Is that clear enough for you?
I didn't kill my mother. I would never hurt her.
Where were you the night she died?
I was...at home.
My wife was out of town, so...
I was by myself.
Doing what?
Reading.
Reading what?
Proust.
I didn't think anyone still read Proust.
Which one of Proust's many books were you reading?
Look, I'm telling you the truth.
You have motive, access,
and your alibi is not only flimsy,
it's kind of pretentious.
And the only way we can help you
is if you're honest with us.
I want to talk to my lawyer.
Hey, ma.
Hey, there you are.
Listen, you have to take folic acid as soon as possible.
Good to know.
Uh, were you able to reschedule my doctor's appointment?
Well, I tried,
But if you don't cancel at least 24 hours ahead of time,
they charge you,
So I just went to the appointment.
You...went to my doctor's appointment?
For my pregnancy?
Yeah, I told them I'm your mother.
I mean, I didn't pretend to be you.
I'm not some kind of crazy person.
What did you talk about at my doctor's appointment?
Well, I asked them if I could be your midwife.
Ma!
You're not going to deliver my baby!
It's not gonna be a home birth.
We could go to the hospital.
There's no "We"!
This is not a "We"! The -- wha--
You know what?
I can get my own vitamins. And I can talk to my own doctor.
And I can go to my own appointment.
I was just trying to help you.
Well, you're not being helpful.
You're being invasive, and I need you to stop.
Geez. Ma.
Five sigma's fun, but forensics solves crimes.
Ah, okay.
Five-sigma's fun, but forensics solves crimes.
Chin up.
Five sigma's --
You would not believe what my moth--
What are you doing?
89, 90, 91.
I'm just, um --
I'm doing my usual 100 brushes a day.
What does it look like I'm doing?
It looks like you were singing into your hairbrush
and practicing for your summer-camp talent show.
That's absurd.
The camps I went to never had talent shows.
What's that?
"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic" --
These are the worst lyrics ever.
I'm practicing for my next lecture.
Yeah, how did it go today?
It went well...
Too well.
What happened?
Nothing.
It's just that now there are expectations
that I'm gifted as a teacher,
and I don't exactly know
what I did for anyone to think that.
So if someone, or anyone, comes to my next lecture
and they're disappointed, maybe they won't like me.
And maybe I don't want them to anyway.
Okay.
Someone paid you a compliment
that you're not really handling well beca--
You met a guy!
And you like him!
Who is he?!
His name is Jack Armstrong.
Jack Armstrong.
He's a professor.
A professor.
He knows how to use tools.
He's smart, he's funny,
and he may actually be a grown-up.
Seriously?
And when I look at him, I picture us having sex,
if you get my drift.
It'd be impossible not to.
Wh-- but, okay, so what? Why are you so upset?
Because...
Because I know that it just won't work between us.
There's just no way.
He's married?
Nope. Divorced, six years. Has a daughter.
He's about to be deported?
Born and raised in Michigan.
Department rivalry,
like a Jets/Sharks kind of thing? It's --
Jane, it's not gonna work
because it -- it just can't.
Because every time I feel this way about someone,
it ends badly.
Okay, well, hang on a second.
I mean, uh...
I've never seen you like this.
You're -- you're swooning.
To swoon is to faint from emotion.
I know! But I don't have a word
for singing in a sexy voice into your hairbrush.
I mean, come on.
Give the guy a chance, okay?
It's Frankie. I got to go.
Here.
Okay, and we're sexy...
Sexy, sexy...
Go away.
...sexy.
Hi, Polly. What can we do for you?
I heard Mr. Larry's being held here --
That you suspect him in his mother's murder?
Well, I'm -- I'm sorry,
but we can't comment on an ongoing investigation.
But you're making a mistake!
He couldn't have hurt his mother.
When he found out she died,
he was a wreck -- completely heartbroken.
I've known him most of his life.
He's a good man.
Well, sometimes good people do bad things, Polly.
I'm -- I'm very sorry.
His lawyers will let you know how to help.
Usually, during the trial phase, friends and family --
No, you're not listening!
I can prove that he's innocent.
You can?
Larry did not murder his mother.
I did!
I understand that Polly's confession was emotionally charged,
but her claim that she helped Chelsea commit suicide
by giving her a fatal dose of morphine is...patently false.
Chelsea Rothsburgher did not die of an overdose of morphine.
Well, she gave us a pretty detailed confession.
I mean, she told us how they came up with the plan,
how they hoarded morphine, picked the day.
Why would she admit it if it wasn't true?
Well, she could be protecting Larry.
She could be a pathological liar with narcissistic tendencies.
She could be having a psychotic break.
Or she could be telling the truth.
Yep. She's telling the truth.
What just happened?
Because a second ago, she was a pathological liar.
Well, I-I tested Chelsea's saline bag,
and the contents are a mixture of saline and liquid morphine.
So Polly did kill Chelsea, just like she said.
Her story is true, but she didn't murder Chelsea.
By the time that Polly injected the morphine in the saline bag,
Chelsea was already dead.
Come again?
If Chelsea's heart had been pumping,
the morphine would have been drawn into the blood flow
and killed her.
Except that someone got to her first.
Indeed.
Well, she's guilty of attempted murder, at least.
Mnh-mnh. The law is very clear.
The attempted murder of a dead body is not a crime.
So, we're saying that two separate people
both just happened to try to murder the same person
on the same night?
What do you think?
No such thing as a coincidence.
Maybe Polly knew what Larry Jr. did
and thought she could protect him
by injecting the morphine and taking the fall.
That would be a good theory,
but I just met with Larry Jr. And his lawyer,
and I might have implied that our case is airtight
and that Larry Jr. is two steps away from death row.
Massachusetts doesn't have the death penalty.
My point was made.
Larry admitted he lied about his alibi
to protect his marriage.
Oh, he was with another woman.
He was being intimate with two other women...
and one man... at the same time.
And unfortunately, there's video...
for our eyes only.
Did I say "Ours"? I meant yours.
Oh, come on, guys. Don't do this to me.
It's a chain-of-command thing, bud.
I'm sorry. Our hands are tied.
You remember the guy that sat there yesterday?
Yeah.
Well, the desk, the chair --
it's just kind of become a thing.
You know, we need to do something to de-thingify it.
You know what I mean?
Maybe if one of us, you know, sat there sometimes,
it wouldn't seem so empty.
It's a great idea.
We should definitely do that.
I mean, uh, Maura needs me now, so...
Yeah, I got to... be somewhere.
Are you looking for something?
No, I'm -- I'm hiding from an empty chair.
Literally or philosophically?
Both, I think. What are you doing?
The final test results came back on the saline bag.
There was enough morphine in there to end her life
peacefully and painlessly.
Is there any chance that the air embolism
could have killed Chelsea when she was sleeping?
No, she would have been wide awake
and felt every excruciating moment.
It's just tragic -- the brutal irony of her death.
How do you mean?
Well, she planned on dying one way,
and then what happened was the exact opposite of what she wanted.
Yeah.
Dr. Isles?
Yes. Hi.
Could you sign here, please?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
He wrote the card in Latin.
Barf.
What kind of flowers are these?
It's actually a tree.
And over the next two weeks,
the roots are gonna get so strong
that they're gonna break the ceramic pot
unless I re-plant it with enough room to grow.
A latin card and a metaphor plant?
He could be your soul mate,
or your clone.
The truth is, I have been doing
a field study on dating for over 10 years,
And I can no longer ignore the results.
There is no Mr. Right out there for me.
Maura. Come on.
All right, you can't look at relationships
like they're scientific experiments.
The guy who I had the most amazing sexual chemistry with?
A face licker.
Yeah.
And the next guy who I had feelings for
ended up dead,
and I was framed for his murder.
To be fair...
getting murdered was not his fault.
For all we know, he -- he could have been a wonderful boyfriend.
And then the guy who said that he really wanted my body --
he meant it literally, because he was a serial killer
who made sculptures out of dead women's bodies.
Yes, that was unfortunate.
But... would a serial killer
Send you a romantic metaphor plant?
I'm not sure.
The nerium oleander has two meanings.
It's rare and beautiful and also deadly.
Really?
God, you'd think a guy would brush up on his botany
before sending you a tree with mixed messages.
Okay.
Where are you going?
Honey. I'm sorry.
I know you're iffy about trusting your gut
when it comes to men,
But your professional instincts are spot on,
and I think what you said about the irony about Chelsea's death,
that could actually be the key to this case.
That bad?
I've seen things I can't unsee.
You okay?
Larry's not our guy, and...
let's not talk about it ever again.
It's probably for the best.
So Maura told me that an air embolism is excruciating
and that Chelsea probably woke up
and actually felt her heart exploding in her chest.
Note to self -- don't go that way.
I think we've been looking at this case in the wrong way.
It's not about millions of dollars.
The motive is more personal than that.
What do you mean?
I think that someone found out
about Chelsea's plan for assisted suicide,
and they didn't want her to die peacefully.
They wanted her to suffer.
Somebody hated her.
Yeah.
So all we have to do is figure out who.
Come on in.
Thank you.
Please have a seat.
I think it's best to be up front.
Damn.
I... haven't finished yet.
You were gonna say you're not that into me.
I'm sorry.
I really thought we had chemistry.
It seemed like you thought so, too.
We do. I-I just think that's... that's actually the problem.
You're going with "It's not you. It's me"?
Oh, no, it's you. Very much you.
That's direct.
For some reason, the men that I am attracted to
all have serious neurological and biological disorders.
And since I'm wildly attracted to you,
I strongly suggest that you get a full physical
and psychological checkup immediately.
And don't be afraid of a second opinion
because a misdiagnosis would cost you valuable time.
You're wildly attracted to me?
I just told you that you might be severely ill,
and that's all you heard?
Are you sure about this, maura?
Do you really want to live alone and fear,
instead of with somebody who knows what it's like to be scared?
No.
Okay, then, so we're both terrified.
But the only thing that scares me more than getting hurt is...
never falling in love again.
It only needs to work out once, right?
That's what my best friend's mother always says.
Your friend's mom is a very wise woman.
Well, she also says
you have to kiss a lot of frogs to find your prince.
Factually incorrect on many levels,
but I still like the sentiment.
That's exactly what I said!
So, what do you think?
I'm not an amphibian with unlikely royal ancestry,
but are you willing to take a chance on me anyway?
Did Polly have any idea
who else might have known about her plan to kill Chelsea?
Well, she swears they kept it absolutely secret.
But they talked about the plan for three weeks.
Why so long?
Chelsea wanted every detail to be perfect,
From the amount of morphine
to the wine she had with her last meal.
That's a lot of talk in a house full of people.
And the only visitors she had were her sons.
So her kids and the household staff are the only people
who could have overheard the suicide plan.
Yeah. I'll have Frankie do a deep background check,
try and figure out who wanted to see her suffer.
Ma, that's not what I ordered.
I mean, thank you.
And would you please sit with me while I eat?
Okay. I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings.
And we can talk about my pregnancy.
It's just... will you please just...
be respectful of my boundaries?
You think this is about my boundary problems?
You don't have any boundaries, either.
You've got 10-foot walls made of steel.
And I know why you built them...
because you watched me make the mistake of being completely dependent.
So to avoid the same fate,
you chose never to depend on anyone.
But now you have to decide
whether those 10-foot walls are working for you.
Or are they just leftovers
from trying so hard not to be me?
I'm sorry I went to your doctor's appointment.
I should have asked you first.
Who are you,
and what have you done with my mother?
Eat your chicken.
What'd you find?
You remember Brad Oskoff?
Yeah, the handyman chauffeur
with the expensive tastes?
His mother, Katrina Oskoff,
司机
worked at the Rothsburgher mansion from 1976 to 1979,
The year Brad was born.
After that, Katrina lived in a house
bought by the Rothsburgher Corporation.
She died of liver disease when Brad was 16 years old.
That's the year he started working for the family.
What was that you said about coincidences?
No such thing.
There's definitely a resemblance.
You know, if I was a Rothsburgher by blood
but had to work as the help, I'd be pretty pissed off, too.
Do you think Brad has been stewing on it all this time?
Jane.
Yeah. I d...
You guys, what are we gonna do about Frost's chair?
I think...
you were right before. We should use it.
Then what?
Only one way to find out.
I got to say...
I know he's in my thoughts, he's in my heart,
and some people would say he's in this room,
but Detective Barry frost isn't sitting here.
Yeah, it's just a chair.
A chair.
Maura says that the syringe used to inject an air bubble
into Chelsea's vein would be completely empty.
There would be no residue.
Brad's too smart to throw the murder weapon away at the house.
Where did he say he was the night Chelsea died?
At the movies.
A theater attendant saw him before and after.
So that leaves 2 hours and 40 minutes.
All right, I'll check the trash cans and dumpsters
on his route and at the movie theater.
He probably dropped the syringe somewhere along the way.
Yeah.
The DNA on the cylinder is yours.
Probably got there when you took the cap off with your teeth.
People make that mistake a lot.
Using a syringe is not a crime.
We also found some DNA at the nose of it. It's a small sample.
We had to send it away for a specialized test,
but we're confident it's gonna
come back testing positive for Chelsea's DNA.
Until then, you have the opportunity
to give us your side of the story,
make a better deal with the D.A.
Not feeling chatty?
All right, we'll go first.
Yeah, it took us a while to see the resemblance.
Same jaw. Same eyes.
I don't know what you're talking about.
When Chelsea said she would give you a lump sum
just like the rest of the staff,
was that the last straw?
I didn't care about that.
I think you should. You're Larry Rothsburgher's son.
Shut up!
You didn't know, did you?
She wanted forgiveness.
She was sorry for not having welcomed me into the family
like she should have.
She just couldn't get over the fact that her husband
had an affair... with my mom.
So she tried to give you money, make things right?
I didn't get a chance to know my dad
when he was alive because it was too hard for her.
Then she tried to make it right with a pile of money.
How did you know she was gonna commit suicide?
Because I saw Polly hiding bottles of liquid morphine.
And the idea of her just...
just getting to go to sleep...
Made you angry.
She decided my life was dirt.
Why should she get to choose an easy death?
She kept trying to breathe.
It only took three or four minutes,
but it felt like a year.
Well, she suffered. You got what you wanted.
Why doesn't that make you happy?
Every time I close my eyes...
I see her face staring at me.
And I...
and -- and I...
I think she was trying to forgive me.
I just want to go back to the day
that she told me the truth and say,
"It's okay.
It's okay."
And just say, "I forgive you."
And it's completely normal to be like a cat in heat
during your second trimester.
Really? I thought that was a myth.
Mm, it's not, so beware of pregnancy goggles.
You mean like beer goggles?
Worse.
Stick to these rules --
no fanny packs, no cellphone holsters,
and no sandals with black socks.
Well, that's just good rules for life in general.
You can't imagine how many times I used to ask your father
to pull the car over so we could get it on.
No, no!
No, no! You see?
That boundary -- you just blew right past it.
It...
So it's okay to talk about sex with strangers,
but not your father and your boss?
Write that down.
She took the Triumph on her date?
Yeah, apparently he's a fan of the sidecar.
That's it?
We're working on our boundaries.
Yes, apparently,
it's better if we let you volunteer things.
Well, he didn't try to kill me.
That's a good sign.
What are you drinking?
Grapefruit lucys.
Grapefruit ricky.
It's a grapefruit ricky but without the ricky.
It's just grapefruit.
May I have one, please?
But a real one, not the one that we're making Jane drink.
Sure.
So, tell me,
was the governor upset with Jane's phone prank?
Well, according to the press conference,
he was very glad that he pushed for further investigation.
So apparently not.
Ooh. So this is a cause for celebration.
Why, 'cause we solved the case
but we didn't get the credit?
No, because you didn't get fired
and Maura's pretty sure
she's not dating a serial killer.
Hooray!
Hooray!
Give me one sip.
No.
