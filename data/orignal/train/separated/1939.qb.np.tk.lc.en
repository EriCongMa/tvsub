&quot; the distance &quot;
your tumor is smart . but so am i. i can beat it .
any one of these approaches would likely kill the patient ?
i refuse to spend the last few months of my life
feeling like a pile of crap .
i am going to give you more than a few months .
are you nervous ?
nobody thinks that this can work .
no one understands it .
you get at my tumor ,
you get at my knowledge ,
i get at my life .
each card represents a fetus
that i &apos;m gonna teach robbins how to fix .
i &apos;m not ready to take this over yet .
where &apos;s dr. herman ?
she stepped out .
what do you need ?
it &apos;s glenda castillo .
i need you to scan me .
let &apos;s go .
i need herman right now .
arizona , it &apos;s time .
amelia ?
i &apos;ll get the o.r. prepped .
you &apos;ll inform the patient ?
in 1888 , william williams keen
became one of the first surgeons
to successfully remove a brain tumor .
a big win . it &apos;s true .
you can look it up .
what &apos;s harder to find , however ,
are stories of all the times old double @-@ billy k
tried to pull a tumor out of a brain and lost .
the losses must have happened .
a surgeon must always be prepared to lose .
and in neurosurgery , with the big tumors --
we lose those battles as often as we succeed .
the key , though , win or lose , is to never fail .
and the only way to fail is not to fight .
so you fight until you can &apos;t fight anymore .
word &apos;s getting around .
you &apos;re gonna have a full gallery .
everybody wants to see the show .
you feeling good , confident ?
you &apos;re not worried , are you ? are you worried ?
this is where you leave me , dr. hunt .
you okay ? do you need anything ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m great . i just ...
prep alone , so ...
i will see you on the other side .
okay .
okay . okay .
we are doing this , okay ?
we &apos;re doing this .
if she &apos;s awake , she &apos;ll tell you for the fifteenth time
to save her child &apos;s life , not hers .
listen to her , let her say her piece ,
then you do what needs to be done .
i don &apos;t think that i can do -- no , i know i can &apos;t .
you can .
nicole .
you will .
let &apos;s get you inside now , okay ?
okay , i have everything set up .
you will have all of your films ,
your favorite scrub nurse , y--
what is happening ?
i &apos;m being a superhero .
o ... kay .
there &apos;s a scientific study that shows
that if you stand like this in superhero pose
for just five minutes before a job interview or ...
a big presentation or a really hard task ,
you will not only feel more confident ,
you will perform measurably better .
seriously ?
seriously .
you feel it ?
we &apos;re superheroes .
we are superheroes .
hold up your head and enter the arena
and face the enemy .
fight until you can &apos;t fight anymore .
never let go .
never give up .
here &apos;s the plan .
we &apos;re gonna embolize the tumor to see if we can reverse
the effects on mom &apos;s circulation .
and if not , then i &apos;m afraid --
where &apos;s herman ?
never run .
never surrender .
glenda &apos;s platelet count is critically low ,
so we need to give her six packs of platelets
to avoid liver capsule bleeding .
and then we &apos;ll perform the fetoscopy
to reverse the cascade --
you keep saying &quot; we , &quot; but i only see you .
where the hell is herman ?
she &apos;s not coming .
what do you mean she &apos;s not coming ?
fight the good fight .
start the clock , please .
you fight ...
ten blade .
... even when it seems inevitable ...
... that you &apos;re about to go down swinging .
so ... this is a regular thing .
you all come up here - and you watch surgeries . why ?
not just surgeries --
the big surgeries , the whale surgeries ,
the rare ones , the crazy ones .
i mean , you &apos;re on the edge of your seat .
the patient could die .
this is life or death .
the adrenaline , the rush --
okay , so you watch , like , the worst day
of a person &apos;s life like a movie .
no , not like a movie . that &apos;s insulting .
this is not entertainment .
&quot; movie . &quot;
oh , okay . this is where the good part starts .
excuse me . ah , thanks for saving my seat .
i almost got my arm torn off ,
but , uh , your timing is excellent .
ah , the dye &apos;s coming in .
it &apos;s kickoff time .
let &apos;s go ahead and inject the dye .
lights , please .
what does the dye do ?
oh , the dye makes the whole tumor glow so that
we can see where the tumor ends and where the brain begins .
nice to see you face @-@ to @-@ face .
now you have to go .
bipolars , please .
this is my favorite part .
yeah , i @-@ i thought only the tumor was supposed to glow .
that is the tumor .
oh , we are not in kansas anymore .
the baby &apos;s anemic . let &apos;s transfuse him .
40 milliliters of irradiated prbc .
robbins , we need to get in and out .
glenda &apos;s pressure is through the roof .
well , if we don &apos;t stop this bleeding , the baby will die .
and the idea is to save both of them ,
and i think that i can do it .
do you think , or you know ?
i know i can .
robbins , i respect you and consider you a friend ,
so it is with kindness when i tell you
that you &apos;re only half a fetal surgeon , not even .
you &apos;re half a fellow .
you brought this patient to me .
no , i brought this patient to your boss .
i have spent the past 4.1 / 2 months getting everything
that dr . herman knows pounded into my brain .
do you hear yourself ? 4.1 / 2 months ?
you want her hands , you have them right here .
22 @-@ gauge needle .
here you go .
hey . hey , chief , any chance you could lose me tonight ?
what ? no .
oh , i just thought that it &apos;s kind of quiet down here ,
and now dr. herman &apos;s surgery is happening .
every other resident is watching that surgery .
i &apos;m sorry you pulled the short straw ,
but i need someone down here .
oh , so , wait .
i &apos;m gonna be the only resident who &apos;s down here ?
just you . i &apos;m counting on you to hold down the fort .
can i do that ?
yes . absolutely . i &apos;m your girl . thank you .
hunt , you pushed my meniscus tonight .
what , uh -- what gives ? - i needed the o.r.
shepherd has taken dr. herman up
for her brain surgery .
wait , dr. herman &apos;s going in now ?
i thought she had another month .
okay . right here .
it &apos;s invaded the chiasmatic cistern a little .
dr. shepherd is examining
the margins of the tumor .
who &apos;s subbing in for you ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
we &apos;re gonna be here
for another 14 hours , probably more .
definitely more .
you know the protocol -- over 12 hours ,
have another resident sub in to replace you
so you can recharge , rest , and return .
who &apos;s subbing in for you ?
hey , i have been planning this for months .
there &apos;s kind of no substitute for me .
well , then there &apos;s no substitute for me , either .
if you &apos;re here , i am here .
we &apos;re superheroes .
i mean , i &apos;d do the thing with the hands on the hips ,
but i can &apos;t break scrub .
okay .
retract here , please , edwards .
it &apos;s not working .
i can &apos;t embolize all the vessels .
i handpicked you . and you are letting me down .
i need to open her up .
oh , absolutely not .
we &apos;d have to increase glenda &apos;s anaesthesia , and --
he &apos;s got persistent decels .
i &apos;m not just questioning your abilities .
now i &apos;m questioning mine .
all right , i could open her up ,
exteriorize the uterus and then resect the entire tumor .
the prolonged anesthesia could be catastrophic
to both mom and baby .
if you &apos;re gonna open her up ,
then you should go ahead and deliver .
no . it &apos;s not an option .
this is mirror syndrome , robbins . you know that .
the sicker the baby gets , the sicker glenda gets .
we deliver , glenda will get better .
i said it &apos;s not an option . he &apos;s not far enough along .
he won &apos;t survive .
page alex karev .
okay . wait , stop . what are you doing ?
we &apos;re delivering this baby .
it &apos;s not gonna be easy , but karev may be able to
keep him alive once he &apos;s out .
no . put that phone down .
bailey , i can do this .
arizona , your mentor is on an o.r. table right now
with her skull open
and you think you have something to prove .
well , i &apos;m not gonna let you do that with this patient .
you want to open her up ?
well , do it , but we are delivering this child .
page dr. karev .
okay .
dr. shepherd is now
cutting the tumor away from the gyrus rectus .
gyrus rectus ?
the area responsible for our sense of smell .
i thought arizona would be here .
she &apos;s in surgery .
wait , fetal surgery ? by herself ?
oh , relax . it &apos;s not the ballet or whatever .
though -- though it is a kind of a dance .
there &apos;s grace , a rhythm ... an elegance .
oh . oh , okay .
i got shushed , - but the purple prose is fine .
okay .
she is gonna pull it off , though , right ?
yes . yeah , she will .
dr. shepherd is now clearing the tumor away
from the midbrain structures ...
... the fornix , the thalamus .
it shouldn &apos;t be taking this long .
we &apos;re behind . already .
uh , using extreme care not to violate
the interior commissure .
dr. shepherd calls this the dream box .
dr. grey , i &apos;m sorry , but &quot; dream box &quot; ?
where we create dreams
and memories and discern shapes and colors .
read a book , for god &apos;s sake .
webber , you okay ?
oh , i &apos;m fine .
her shoulders are tense .
something &apos;s bothering her .
maybe you &apos;ll get lucky and you &apos;ll snip out the part
that makes her kind of bitchy .
why would you say that ?
i was -- it was a joke .
well , you &apos;re right .
i screw this up , nicole herman will no longer be bitchy .
she &apos;ll no longer be able to laugh , either , or be a surgeon .
she will no longer be nicole herman .
she won &apos;t be anything anymore ,
and you want to make jokes about that ?
no , i &apos;m -- you &apos;re right .
damn it . damn it .
what is it ?
i can &apos;t get around the fornix
without hitting the hypothalamus .
well , can you move laterally to avoid it ?
there &apos;s not enough carotid to mobilize .
i &apos;m trapped .
her sats are dropping . she &apos;s hypoxic .
robbins , it &apos;s not going to get better .
okay , okay . there we go .
oh , crap . it &apos;s stuck . the tumor &apos;s too big .
hey , sorry . i would have been here sooner .
but i was already at home .
well , you should have stayed at home .
what ?
nothing . she &apos;s pouting .
i can &apos;t get it from this the angle .
if i force it , it ruptures .
i need -- i need to widen the incision .
you have to widen it anyway . karev &apos;s here .
we &apos;re delivering .
we &apos;re not delivering . he &apos;s not viable .
i can do this . it &apos;ll be just like last time .
what do you mean last time ?
we did one of these before .
herman wasn &apos;t available , so we decided
to deliver and remove the mass after .
i knew it . i knew it .
that was entirely different .
sounds the same to me .
you &apos;re trying to prove that you &apos;re herman .
i thought you had something . i thought you were special .
just do the &quot; c , &quot; robbins . i &apos;ll keep him alive .
i thought you would be better and in less time .
but today ? today , you embarrassed me .
excising the tumor .
gonna need lots of kellies .
robbins , listen to me . do the right thing .
deliver this child .
i don &apos;t have time for you to catch up .
i don &apos;t have time for three strikes .
i &apos;ve given you every last second that i can give .
but it &apos;s time to stop .
something like this happens again , you &apos;re out .
if herman were here , she &apos;d tell you the same --
stop it . stop talking . stop it right now !
you &apos;re right , dr. bailey . i am not dr. herman .
i am dr. robbins , and i am the fetal surgeon here .
and i have chosen to do this procedure ,
and there was a point at which you could no longer
be on board , - but that point is long gone .
i am in the middle of a woman &apos;s uterus .
and any slip i might make could result
in catastrophic blood loss .
and -- and if i slip , it will be because you were screaming
in my ear and not because i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing .
you either need to get on board and shut up
or you need to get the hell out .
i mean , she sounds like dr. herman .
she hasn &apos;t moved a muscle in 15 minutes .
what do you think it is ?
i don &apos;t know .
but her game face is slipping .
yeah , maybe i should -- - hmm ?
april . - i @-@ i &apos;m not working . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m just --
i &apos;m not ready to work yet .
no , no , no , it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m glad to see you .
i &apos;m just gonna sit .
dr. herman was with me on my worst day .
i just wanted to be with her for hers .
how &apos;s this going ?
uh , she &apos;s trying to dissect around the fornix .
but she still has a long way to go .
so , why are they not operating ?
dr. shepherd .
if i go any further posteriorly ,
i violate the hypothalamus .
if i take a lateral approach , i hit the carotids .
if i go inferiorly and i wreck her optic apparatus --
you could -- - i am lost here .
i am lost in the forest . there is no clear path .
just pick a path , and you will be fine .
i am trying to find a way to keep her whole , edwards .
i can &apos;t move without letting a piece of her go .
dr. shepherd .
dr. webber . what do you need ?
i thought i could help , maybe be a sounding board .
we could work through whatever it is you &apos;re stuck on .
kill the intercom , please .
dr. webber , step over here , please .
edwards , would you mind taking a step back ?
you can be a big help .
i need you to call my brother .
tell him - he needs to get on a plane .
he &apos;s in d.c. , so if he goes now , he could be here in ,
what , six hours , seven ?
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the best idea .
i am in over my head .
i made a mistake .
i took on an impossible task ,
and my hubris is going to kill her .
please . get him on the phone .
get him on a plane .
get him here .
now .
this is taking way too long .
uh , mom needs increased ventilatory support .
robbins , come on . that baby &apos;s right there .
i &apos;ve got this . let me have him .
ligating the last artery .
we &apos;ve lost the fetal pulse . is the cord compressed ?
no . he &apos;s in cardiac arrest .
put your hands under him just like this .
good . now apply pressure on the wound .
harder . he won &apos;t break , okay ?
just hold him there and keep his chest up .
good , good , good . just like that .
all right , push five micrograms of epi
while i start compressions .
oh , dear lord .
careful .
you know what you &apos;re doing .
please just call him .
i &apos;m not even halfway through .
if i can &apos;t get past this step --
you have it in your head that he &apos;s better than you .
but it isn &apos;t true .
i &apos;ve seen him standing exactly where you are now ,
unsure where to go next .
i know that tumor .
he &apos;s got it hanging on their bedroom wall .
a drawing , not the actual tumor .
he found a way .
yes .
which is why i need him here .
shepherd , i can tell you right now what would happen
if i called your brother .
if she hadn &apos;t already herniated , derek would come in here
and he would take this surgery , your surgery , away from you .
then he would kill her .
because this is your plan .
he wouldn &apos;t know where you &apos;ve already been
or where you need to go next .
you are on your own here .
no one can help you ,
and you do not need them to .
he &apos;s not here . you are .
now what &apos;s next ?
robbins , he &apos;s not coming back .
karev , shut your damn mouth .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
come on , baby . oh , come on .
you can let go now , bailey .
it &apos;s time to put him back in .
he &apos;s not even -- i held him in my hands .
he &apos;s not even born , and i held him in my hands .
i know that feeling .
it &apos;s privilege , great privilege .
navigation probe .
edwards , you &apos;re on .
intercom , please .
dr. shepherd is identifying
the lamina terminalis so that she can go around the commissure ,
laterally dissecting away from the perforated arteries .
bipolars .
can you avoid splitting the fornix ?
i sure as hell hope so .
so far , so good .
keep going . find your way out .
how you feeling , edwards ?
good . i &apos;m good .
you sure ?
i can try and find someone if you need a break .
nope . you &apos;re not gonna find a better assist than me .
i earned this spot .
if dr.shepherd is here , i am here .
this is the point of no return .
once we start this , we don &apos;t stop
until the last of this tumor is gone .
are you ready ?
are you ?
smart ass .
here we go .
glenda &apos;s not out of the woods ,
but her numbers were definitely improving .
i &apos;m gonna head up to the icu and keep an eye on her .
you did good , robbins .
i wasn &apos;t trying to pick a fight in there .
it &apos;s just , - from where i was standing --
six months ago , i would have picked the same fight .
well , for what it &apos;s worth ,
herman picked the right person to pass the torch to .
she &apos;s not passing anything . she hasn &apos;t gone anywhere .
i think ...
i cleared the optic nerve .
there . that wasn &apos;t so hard .
no comments from the peanut gallery .
okay . we are going radioactive , folks .
let &apos;s get this room turned over .
all non @-@ essential personnel , hit the street .
non @-@ essential means you , dr. webber .
i appreciate you coming down here . you have no idea .
i &apos;m happy to stay .
edwards and i have it from here .
right , edwards ?
edwards ?
i &apos;ll get the 02 . hold her head .
or maybe you could scrub in .
all she has to do now is place her radioactive seeds .
they &apos;ll kill whatever tumor cells are left behind
and keep them from coming back .
well , i &apos;m happy to help . i &apos;m just saying , &quot; why me ? &quot;
she needs an assist who she doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
and if i remember correctly ,
you were this close to specializing in neuro .
well , i haven &apos;t been that resident in a very long time .
have her back .
she just needs to feel you &apos;re there . she &apos;ll do the rest .
damn it ! damn it !
i just got here .
i haven &apos;t had a chance to screw anything up yet .
i need to be able to place these seeds precisely
if i &apos;m gonna prevent the tumor from recurring .
i had a pre @-@ op map to help identify my landmarks .
but with a tumor this big ,
everything will move after you resect ,
like a mudslide or an earthquake .
yeah . i didn &apos;t count on this much intracranial shift .
i &apos;m gonna have to use the ultrasound to map out the shift
and then morph it back into the pre @-@ op plan .
okay , so you &apos;re pretty much eyeballing it .
yeah , pretty much .
sounds like a plan . let &apos;s do it .
how long have they been at it ?
six minutes .
they &apos;ve only placed three seeds .
even with the gloves and the vests ,
they can only be exposed to that level
of radiation for , what , another 20 minutes ?
she needs to move faster .
i need to move faster .
these gloves are so thick , i can &apos;t feel what i &apos;m doing .
you &apos;re doing fine . it &apos;s not a race .
except that it is .
amelia , what are you doing ?
shepherd , what are you doing ?
it &apos;s so much easier like this .
you &apos;re exposing yourself to direct radiation .
you need to put that glove back on right now .
amelia .
it &apos;s fine .
i got it . i got it .
robbins , you &apos;re not gonna hear this from me too often ,
so savor it .
you did very , very well in there .
oh , i &apos;m so touched , i could cry .
ugh . i am exhausted .
you &apos;d think a tumor would give you extra energy or something .
mm , i wouldn &apos;t .
mm , maybe not .
here .
we &apos;re getting down to it , robbins -- the final stretch .
after those dozen cards , that &apos;s it , we &apos;re done .
you &apos;ll have completed a year long fellowship
in less than six months ,
and i &apos;ll have kicked the bucket .
don &apos;t .
i knew i picked the right horse when i picked you .
yeah , please don &apos;t call me a horse .
it really is an accomplishment .
not just to do it , but to become as good as you have become .
it &apos;s a real exercise in perseverance .
really something to be proud of .
thank you .
i &apos;m not talking about you . i &apos;m talking about me .
you were a complete disaster when we started .
but i persevered , and after all of my hard work ,
you are actually becoming a fetal surgeon .
i deserve a medal .
arizona ?
hey .
you okay ?
yeah .
i heard you flew solo tonight .
i did .
how did it go ?
great .
that &apos;s ...
congratulations .
thank you .
i looked for you in shepherd &apos;s gallery .
she &apos;s ... still at it if you want to head up .
i can &apos;t go up there .
okay .
i want to , but i can &apos;t watch . i just can &apos;t .
over the past four months ,
that woman beat the hell out of me , trying to shove
every piece of knowledge and experience
in to my head . she did .
it &apos;s there , all of it .
she &apos;s in my head .
but i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m not ready for my head to be the only place that she exists .
grey , stop her .
she needs to put that glove back on right now .
she &apos;s almost done .
she has a 20 @-@ minute window . it &apos;s only been 15 .
without the glove , she &apos;s cutting her exposure time in half .
she &apos;s over her limit . shepherd !
hunt , if i don &apos;t place these seeds , the tumor recurs ,
and everything i have done for her counts for nothing .
you &apos;re gonna make yourself sick .
amelia , he &apos;s right . the tumor could recur anyway .
but it won &apos;t be because of me .
shepherd , put on the glove !
amelia .
done . i &apos;m done .
get this gear out of here , bring back the troops .
it &apos;s time to close .
that was ...
really dumb ?
no , badass .
hey , um , i &apos;ve got
a post @-@ op abdominal @-@ wall reconstruction in the icu .
do you mind if i run up and check on him before we head home ?
yeah , sure . i &apos;ll just -- i &apos;ll hang here .
i &apos;ll be fine . go .
okay .
hey , you &apos;ve been out for hours .
god .
wait , what ?
congratulations , dr. edwards .
you were in surgery 13 straight hours .
doesn &apos;t really happen anymore with hospital regulations .
your class doesn &apos;t get a chance
to build up that kind of stamina .
i missed it ? it &apos;s over ?
oh , n @-@ no , no . it &apos;s not over .
they &apos;re -- they &apos;re still closing .
uh , no .
now , you -- you lay back . let me get you some water .
pickups .
juice .
thank you .
how are you doing ?
just need to get the dura closed with a watertight seal .
this is the easy part .
which anyone else can do ,
so why don &apos;t you let someone else take this ?
dr. shepherd , i &apos;m here . i &apos;m -- i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m back .
i &apos;m good to go .
just please tell me it &apos;s not too late .
no , edwards . you &apos;re just in time .
you can finish closing .
really ?
you started this with me . you should finish it .
don &apos;t let edwards screw up the stitch , okay ?
i don &apos;t want herman seeing a big ugly scar
every time she looks in the mirror .
not a problem .
hey , glenda . - you just about ready to go ?
oh , my god . so ready .
and no offense , but i am so done looking at this boring room .
well , enjoy the fresh air while you can .
i will see you in a month for your post @-@ op checkup .
in the meantime , rest . take it easy , eat well .
thank you so much .
well , don &apos;t hug me .
dr. robbins saved both your life and your son &apos;s .
i don &apos;t know if you guys can tell me , but ...
how &apos;s dr. herman ?
dr. shepherd is identifying
the lamina terminalis so that
she can go around the commissure .
stop . go home .
i need to figure this out .
no , you need to take a break .
there &apos;s no swelling , no edema .
i don &apos;t know why she &apos;s not awake .
it could be any number of reasons .
don &apos;t tell me what it could be .
don &apos;t you think i know every possible thing it could be ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i just need ...
i know .
you need it to be over .
i need her to wake up .
is that --
what ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s probably nothing . it &apos;s tiny .
what ?
is that a small lacunar infarct right there ?
did she have a stroke ?
good work , edwards .
she &apos;s gonna wake up .
she might .
but if she doesn &apos;t ,
i &apos;m gonna have to make some decisions .
and you did this for mark .
i did .
but you &apos;re not gonna have to , okay ?
i can &apos;t do this by myself .
i can &apos;t make that call .
and i know what she wants .
but i don &apos;t think that i can make that call .
hey .
hey , you are not by yourself , okay ?
you &apos;re not alone , do you hear me ?
it &apos;s okay .
nicole .
m @-@ m @-@ mommy ?
is that you , mommy ?
god , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine .
do you know where you are ?
the same place i always am .
what &apos;s your name ?
that hasn &apos;t changed , either .
squeeze my finger .
good .
and here .
good .
gross motor functions intact .
follow the light , okay ?
how are you feeling ?
hey , it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m okay .
you got it all , didn &apos;t you ?
edwards , did she get all of it ?
yeah . she got all of it .
hey , no crying in here . crybabies out .
dr. hunt . dr. webber .
gentlemen , looking good .
so are you .
so far , so good .
oh , we &apos;re glad to hear it . dr. shepherd did an amazing job .
yeah , yeah . i brought the tumor .
that made her look pretty good .
give us a second , would you ? robbins and i have some work .
yeah . why don &apos;t we step outside , give them a moment ?
i will be back soon .
we will need a full work @-@ up .
yes , ma &apos;am .
good to have you back .
tell me about glenda castillo .
glenda is recovering well , and , uh , she &apos;s still pregnant .
the baby &apos;s doing well , too .
i knew i picked the right horse .
please stop calling me a horse .
i knew it .
i knew you would not let me down .
i had no doubt .
can you see anything ? anything at all ?
no .
nothing .
completely blind .
you better not be crying .
i &apos;m not .
are you all right ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;ll take a while to sink in .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna want to
be around me when it does .
that will be ugly .
i will be .
if you want me to , i &apos;ll --
you &apos;re missing the point . you &apos;re so thick , robbins .
you &apos;re always just to the left of the point .
the point is i &apos;m going to get to figure it out .
something is going to happen next .
the point is i &apos;m alive .
and i wouldn &apos;t be if you hadn &apos;t been
such a pain in my ass .
i picked the right horse .
why do we even try when the barriers are so high
and the odds are so low ?
why don &apos;t we just pack it in and go home ?
it &apos;d be so , so much easier .
it &apos;s because , in the end ,
there &apos;s no glory in easy .
we were so close .
we were more than close , edwards .
dr. herman lost her sight to her tumor .
we took revenge on the tumor by killing it ,
by tearing it out and decimating it
and decreasing its odds of killing nicole by 100 % ,
by sending death running like a crying bitch ,
by telling death to screw himself --
that is the battle .
and it is the only battle worth fighting .
you should be on a high right now .
and you should be chasing that high
for the rest of your life .
you defeated death .
mere mortals cannot do that . only we can .
no one remembers easy .
only superheroes .
they remember the blood and the bones
and the long , agonizing fight to the top .
only freaking superheroes .
and that is how you become ...
... legendary .
