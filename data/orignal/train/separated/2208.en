You good?
Just wondering what we're walking into,
you coming strapped so heavy.
I've never dealt with this guy Remy before.
You just make sure we don't get ripped off.
I'll make sure we don't get gut.
Here I was,
expecting to transact with some bona fide gangsters.
Instead, you fools roll in here
asking for the friends and family discount?
Think of it as a "get to know you" discount.
If your product is as good as you say it is,
we'll be back for a whole lot more next time.
Open your ears, big man.
'Cause I'm about to educate you on a little something
called supply and demand.
As in people be demanding my supply.
So why do I got to cut you one break
when I got buyers lining up
to pay full price?
Economies of scale, brother.
Low margins, high volume,
equals more profit.
Say instead of this dope here
you was sitting on some toaster ovens.
Would you bust your ass selling unit by unit?
Or would you wholesale that inventory
to some established retailer,
kick back,
watch that cash roll in?
Head that big,
I should've known you had one brain on you.
So we good at 20 a key?
We good.
Actually, we're not.
'Cause you disrespected my boy.
And I don't do business with punks.
So, what? You just gonna walk?
We're gonna take the money and the drugs,
and then we're gonna walk.
Only question is if we're gonna
smoke your ass on the way out.
All right, Levi.
Be cool.
I'm sure we can work this out.
No, bro. I don't think we can.
HPD! Drop your weapons!
Get down on the ground now!
Take 'em away, boys.
All right, turn around.
You did good.
Everything goes as planned,
you'll be out in a couple of years.
Empty the register!
Now!
What's up, Levi?
What's up, bro?
Been thinking about you. Heard you got out.
Wasn't sure if you was coming by, though.
Ah, I had to see this for myself.
Last I heard, you were working the fry station at Blimpie's,
hair net and all that.
You're a legitimate tycoon now.
Guess the last 12 years have been good.
After everything went down, I decided to reevaluate.
Made some changes.
Good. Prison gave you perspective.
What'd you end up doing, about two years?
Knocked down from a nickel.
Good behavior and whatnot.
And all that time,
not even a phone call, after everything we been through.
Like I said,
I'm a different person now.
Right. I'm back now.
Gonna make some moves.
In fact, I'm thinking we should probably talk.
No, Levi.
I don't think we should.
But if you need a job,
I can hook you up with something.
I strike you as the hair net type?
Exactly.
I'll be seeing you.
Real soon.
You know what your problem is?
What's my problem?
Could you just leave me alone?
Leave you alone?
Give me the headphones.
I'll stop. You know me.
Don't be a child.
Why would you start a movie you're not gonna finish?
It drives me crazy.
Because it beats looking at the back of a headrest
for the entire...
So why don't you read a book?
There's a magazine.
Why don't you do the crossword puzzle in here? Sudoku?
You like sudoku?
I don't want to do any of those things,
because what they don't allow me to do
is put on those headphones and tune you out.
Oh, that's nice.
That's really nice.
That's a nice thing to say to your friend, isn't it?
And that's the movie you're gonna watch? This is...
Yeah.
Are you sure you two don't want to sit together?
Absolutely not.
Ab...
No. I don't want to sit next to him
for a number of reasons, uh, the most important being
that I am very claustrophobic.
He is.
I mean, I sit in between two people, with the arms
and the hands and everything.
You touch me, I'll go completely nuts.
Plus, I don't want to have to, you know, jump over him,
give him a lap dance if I got to go use the little boys' room.
Well, in that case, I think I'll skip my second chardonnay.
You're not skipping anything. If you need to use the restroom,
I will gladly get up and let you pass by.
And I'm sorry we've been so disruptive.
We've been disruptive?
No, we haven't been disruptive.
I'm sitting here trying to watch Pitch Perfect 2,
and you're telling me I ain't doing it right.
Okay? You know, you would think that having
a human being sitting between us would-would serve as a buffer
for the constant criticism, but, no, he keeps going
and going and going and going.
He, uh... He gets...
He gets very irritable, very...
kind of volatile when we travel together.
He's-he's antsy because he's not flying the plane.
Well, I can tell this is going to be the longest
45-minute flight of my life.
I'm Steve, by the way.
And the bundle of joy to your right is Danny.
Alissa.
Alissa. That's a nice name.
Nice to meet you, Alissa.
How you doing?
So, uh... So, Alissa, what takes you to Maui today?
Just visiting some friends.
That's nice.
You guys?
Well, it's a funny story. Danny and I are attending
a three-day workshop to focus on our relationship.
Our work relationship.
We are officers of the law.
The State of Hawaii mandates that
we do 24 hours of therapy every working year,
and so we packed it into one weekend
and we're gonna make a, uh...
a brocation out of it.
Brocation?
Brocation. You like that?
That's so cute.
Don't-don't encourage him, all right?
If he and I make it through this weekend
without killing each other, it's a win, so...
Well, if the first ten minutes of this flight are any indication,
I'm not loving your chances.
It doesn't make sense.
Why would Gabriel cut a deal with Shioma
just to turn around and kill him?
Because it was all a power play.
He was just biding his time, earning the Yakuza's trust
until he could make his move.
But he wasn't stopping there.
What do you mean?
He tried to take out the heads of the Triads
and the Makauakane family at the title fight last week.
Thankfully, we stopped him.
Gabriel just took a big swing and missed.
He's got no one left to align himself with.
What do you think his next move is?
I don't know.
But right now I'm more interested in you.
How are you holding up?
I'm fine, Kono.
Really. I'm fine.
Nothing about this is fine.
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah, I just keep...
reminding myself what's waiting for me on the other side.
539 more days.
I miss you.
So, what, no Abby today?
No. She had to go back to San Francisco for a few days.
So what do we got?
Got a John doe.
Couple cliff divers found him here this morning.
Looks to be a botched dump job.
Maxwell.
Care to bring Lieutenant Kelly up to speed?
Gladly. Our victim was killed execution-style,
courtesy of a single gunshot to the back of the head.
T.O.D. is roughly 12 hours ago.
And prior to that, he was badly beaten,
as evidenced by the numerous lacerations
and contusions on the body and face.
You any closer to getting an I.D. on him?
Unfortunately not.
The dermis absorbed too much water to run prints,
so I'll have to take him back to the lab.
Wait a minute, I know this guy.
That's Antone Remiel.
Went by the name Remy.
This guy was supplying drugs to half the dealers on the island,
including Kamekona and his partner Levi back in the day.
Yeah, that's him all right.
Levi came by last night.
I thought he might have put together
that it was me who rolled on him.
Yeah, instead Remy ends up dead.
I'm guessing Levi blamed him for the sting.
Makes sense.
Remy set the time and location of the buy.
Made us come to him.
And Levi, he never cared for him much.
Well, that's because once he got out of prison,
Remy turned his life around.
Did you know he was coaching basketball at a community center?
He also got a girlfriend with a kid on the way.
Should have been me.
Look,
if we don't put levi away and soon,
more people are gonna die.
And we don't have any hard evidence linking him to the murder.
If we're gonna make this case, we need some help.
You asking what I think you're asking?
I need you undercover again.
It's the only way to get to levi.
I'm in.
Kamekona.
You can't be late for school again.
I know, I know.
But baby brother needs his breakfast.
And you, too, moms.
Go, before you miss the bus.
Step right up folks.
Genuine koa wood war clubs,
Hand-carved by the great polynesian warriors of our tribe.
Genuine.
Start selling, flippa.
Genuine war clubs, everybody.
Hand-carved.
Folks, These one-of-a-kind beauties won't last long.
How much?
For you, my friend? Only ten dollars.
All right. Thanks.
Genuine war clubs.
Genuine, bro. Get one when the last folks.
Hey, kid.
Got some muscle in you.
What's your name?
Kamekona.
I'm Levi.
If you're ever interested in making some real money,
we should talk.
Used to think I had people on the outside.
Then I get out and I realize
that most of them aren't my people anymore.
How about you-- how's the family?
Moms passed a few years back.
Kanoa moved to the mainland when I went away.
Haven't spoken to him since.
But Flippa's still around.
Yeah? He still look like a dolphin?
Bruddah only working for me because seaworld's not hiring.
Make a left over here.
You gonna tell me where we going?
Oh, you'll know when you see it.
Look, I said I'd help you.
And I will.
Just as long as it doesn't end up with us paying a visit to Remy.
No, brah.
I don't got to see Remy.
Well, not exactly a confession.
All right, this place is crazy. I mean, they got everything.
Three pools, two spas, they got a meditation garden.
They got... They got a pillow menu
and a soap concierge on call.
Soap concierge.
Soap concierge.
You know, I know how to use soap.
I've been using it for 39 years.
I-I don't think I need any help.
These are handmade artisanal soaps, Danny.
They-they formulate them to your...
to your specific skin type.
You don't just pass something like that up.
I wish your seal buddies could hear you right now.
All right, I got the whole day planned for us today.
We're gonna start with nine holes of golf,
a little stand-up paddleboarding,
then dinner at the steakhouse.
Then you, me, uh, Alissa and a buddy
are gonna go for some drinks afterwards.
Alissa from the plane?
Yeah. Been texting.
Wow, I didn't even see you do that. That's very nice.
Well, you were watching Pitch Perfect 2.
You were busy, you know.
Well, you know, I-I have a girlfriend,
so I don't think I'm gonna be much use.
Why don't you relax?
Just figured we'd have a couple drinks, hang out. It'd be nice.
No, no, no, you figured that you'd have a better chance
of getting right if you had a wingman.
That's what you're thinking.
Oh, yeah, thanks. Okay, goose.
Like I need a wingman.
See that? You see that?
Very nice.
How's this place?
It's good.
You know, I'm pretty sure that this isn't Spring break, though.
I mean, we probably have to attend these classes or whatever.
Relax. We're gonna put a little face time in,
then we'll slip out the back door as soon as we can.
How hard can it be?
Aloha. Welcome.
Aloha.
Are you gentlemen here for the relationship workshop?
Yes, we sure are. I'm Steve. This is my partner, Danny.
I'm the therapist, Loraine.
Hi, Loraine.
‭Hi.
How's it going?
Great.
I'll just ask you to sign in
and to kindly place your cell phones
in the box you see right there.
I'm sorry?
It's this rule I have.
We're about to take a deep
spiritual journey into the inner world that
you two share,
and we can't have any distractions.
Let's see. What-what... What is this, Loraine?
Oh, that's an itinerary
for the subjects we'll be covering this week.
'Cause it says "Overcoming Sexual Incompatibility."
Sex is a vital component for a loving relationship.
You, uh, you signed us up for couples therapy.
This is fine. We can work with this.
This is fine.
It's gonna be great.
Right here.
Here we are.
Just like the old days.
Can I help you with something, big boy?
This is from Levi.
You still in?
Rent's due, and we both know
your mom can't cover it herself.
Zeke's been holding onto something for me for the last few years.
I'd go in and get it myself, but...
if I'm even seen in a place like this,
my P.O. will be all over my ass.
And here I thought I was just giving you a ride.
Help you with something?
I'm here to see Zeke.
Hold up. I got to check you first.
If they find that wire, he's dead.
You done yet?
Why-- you hiding something?
Chin, we got to get him out of there right now.
He's right, Chin.
Wait, wait.
Not yet.
Bruddah, you gettin' too liberal with your hands.
I ain't packing.
And I don't need a piece to put you down, brah.
He's good.
Well, if it ain't big boy himself.
So what brings you back after all these years?
There's got to be 50K in there, easy.
Enough to keep you on your feet
until you figure out your next play.
Brah, I owe some bad dudes a lot of money.
This ain't even a drop in the bucket.
How bad?
I don't come up with 300 large in the next 24 hours,
lights out.
Can you help me?
He's lying. There is no debt.
He just wants to use me to put together some quick cash
for some drug buy.
That's what Levi does-- gets people to do his dirt.
Well, now, you're probably right.
But that doesn't change our objective here,
so let's just take a breath and figure this out.
All right, so we just heard from HPD.
They've been piecing together Levi's whereabouts
for the past 24 hours.
Multiple witnesses have him on the opposite side
of the island at T.O.D.
Which alibis him out for Remy's murder.
That changes things some.
Not necessarily.
Think about this.
Remy was totally out of the game for a decade, right?
But then, within just 48 hours of Levi's release,
he suddenly turns up dead.
So if he didn't pull the trigger,
he definitely ordered the hit.
Exactly. You said yourself that levi's M.O.
is to get other people to do his dirty work for him.
So help him put the money together. Gain his trust.
And that way, even if he never cops to the murder,
we nail him on a drug charge.
Either way, he spends the rest of his life in jail.
I don't know. I've-I've been out of the game for a long time.
Kamekona, no one knows better than you
the damage that he's capable of.
Let's put him away before he can hurt anyone else.
In for a penny, in for a pound, right?
Well, um, i guess what happened was I read the, uh,
course description incorrectly
and, like, misread it. And...
Long story short, Danny and I ended up, uh,
registered in here with you guys in couples therapy.
Question: Why are you still here?
That's a good question. I don't know.
That's a... Good question.
While it's true
this workshop is geared toward couples,
many of the principles covered here--
Such as communication,
trust and teamwork--
Apply to all relationships.
Including working partnerships.
So given that Steve and Danny traveled all this way,
I've agreed to sign off on their therapy hours
once they've completed the course.
I should also tell you that I've spoken
with Steve and Danny about their partnership,
and it is fraught
with some very serious problems.
So I think it would be both cruel
and irresponsible for us to
abandon them in this time of crisis.
Really? I don't.
Because they're not a couple.
So what, Keren?
They're stuck in a relationship they can't get out of,
they fight all the time, and they don't have sex.
It sounds a lot like our marriage to me.
Okay, settle down.
We have a lot of work to do,
and I don't want to waste any more time,
so I'll ask everyone to hold hands
as we get things started with some daily affirmations.
I come from the loving space of my heart,
and I know that love opens new possibilities.
I come from the loving space...
This is great for us.
...of my heart,
I hate you.
And I know that love...
Kamekona's still working on
getting the details on that drug buy.
Once he gets us a time and a location,
we can set up a sting and be in a position to make the bust.
Okay, if you think that's best.
I take it you don't.
That's not it.
I worked with plenty CIs in my day.
Some were pretty good, pretty solid.
Couple of 'em even helped me close a case.
See, the problem is those are the ones that are so good,
you forget that the guy you're working with isn't a cop.
I hear you,
but I'm gonna tell you what John Mcgarrett told me
the first time I brought in a CI.
He said, "Once they're yours,
they're yours for life."
So I'm telling you that Kamekona's more than just a CI to me.
He's 'ohana.
And I've also seen what Levi is capable of.
So, believe me when I tell you
that no one wants to see him
put away more than Kamekona.
Thanks to our undercover Op,
we're now up on Levi's burner phone.
Call logs confirm that Levi was nowhere near the crime scene
at the time of Remy's murder, but check this out.
Shortly after T.O.D.,
Levi receives a call
from a prepaid phone
less than a mile from where the body was discovered.
Oh, that's the shooter.
That's the guy that Levi hired for the hit.
He's calling to tell him Remy's dead.
Right, so if we can track this guy down
and get him to roll on Levi,
then we can pull Kamekona out of there
before the buy even goes down.
Imagine the outside legs
represent the two individuals in the relationship,
while the middle leg represents your union as a couple.
So long as you work together, you are beautifully in sync!
All right, next lap, we're taking a dive.
What are you talking about? Why?
It's an evasive maneuver.
Okay, I need to get to my cell phone
so I can text Alissa about tonight.
You're gonna be my distraction.
We're about to win this thing. You want to fall now?
Come on, let's just finish. Hey, hey, hey.
Priorities, okay? Priorities, Danny.
Just fake an injury, go down, stay down.
Hang on. It's a bad idea.
Here we go. Here we go.
Ankle. Ankle.
Hey, guys, we got a man down here, man down.
Ankle.
Okay. Everything's okay.
I'm gonna get some ice, okay?
Can you make sure he stays on his back?
Stays on his back till I get back?
Okay.
晚点告诉你细节
All right...
All right.
Oh, my god.
Dude, that actually looks kind of funky.
It does? You think? Thanks, Steven.
Okay, got some ice.
Okay, everyone, take note.
Because that is exactly the type of partner
you want by your side in a crisis.
Note his caring, loving and gentle touch.
Now, that's a sound I'll never take for granted again.
I hate to interrupt your moment of zen,
but it's time you fill me in on the details of the buy.
Keehi Small Boat Harbor, tomorrow morning.
Okay. Now I know the where and when.
Who's the buyer?
Guy I hooked up with while I was on the inside.
Nobody you would know.
That's reassuring.
Look, I would tell you that you can trust the dude,
But really, I shouldn't have to,
because you should trust me.
I do, Levi.
Good.
And know this.
I won't make the same mistake twice,
dealing with rats like Remy.
In the end,
The only people you can count on
are your family.
Kanoa, what's going on?
They're tearing the place apart.
Check it out, big bruddah.
Kamekona Tupuloa.
I'm Detective Chin Ho Kelly.
What you doing here?
Colby Jefferson.
I don't know him.
Oh, really? I think you do.
You see, we already know that he's dealing drugs
for you and your partner, Levi Sosa.
Now no one's seen the kid in over two weeks.
Look, I'm sorry, but I don't know nothing about that.
And if you could prove I was dealing drugs,
I'd be locked up right now,
instead of asking you to get the hell out of my mom's house.
You seem like a smart guy, Kamekona,
which means you probably already figured out
That Levi Sosa is a very dangerous man.
And guys in your line of work--
they only end up in two places.
Prison or dead.
So I'm asking you to look at this like an opportunity.
An opportunity to give Levi up
before he drags you down with him.
Levi is 'ohana.
I don't roll on family!
All right, we'll do this the hard way.
Keep on searching!
Tear the place apart if you have to.
Okay, so, the suspect's phone came online
less than 20 minutes ago.
It pinged to that rental house over there.
According to the owner, the place was prepaid in cash.
It's got to be Remy's shooter.
We need to move now.
Man down! I got a man down!
Take cover!
Go! Go! Go!
Clear.
Clear.
Clear.
Clear.
Clear.
You're a former navy seal.
What happened to stealth mode?
I'm sorry.
You awake?
You don't have to whisper now.
No, I'm not awake. I'm asleep, you putz.
Did you see the photos I sent you?
Yeah, I-I saw the photos you sent me.‭
We had fun.
Yeah, you look... Guys look like you're having a great time.
The girls were really bummed you didn't make it.
Yeah. I didn't know what to tell 'em.
You could have told them
you destroyed my entire weekend.
I hope you know that. I hope you're happy.
You know what? It's the second time this month
that ankle's given out on you.
It's not the ankle, the ankle, the ankle, Danny.
We both know this trip never had a chance from the start.
Oh, yeah, what was that supposed to mean?
I'm just curious. Huh?
What do I mean by that?
I'm talking about your attitude.
I'm talking about this black hole
of negative energy that is detective Danny Williams, man.
I just brought us out here
to try to have some fun, reconnect a little bit,
get away from work for a minute,
and-and you're just... You're just...
You've been down on this thing from the start.
Well, for good reason,
apparently, it turns out, right?
You ever hear of the power of positive thinking, Danny?
Yeah, well, it works the other way, too.
It's the power of negative thinking.
Bad things happen to negative people.
See example 1a-- you.
How is...? You basically crippled me
going after this girl.
And somehow it's my fault?
Loraine said we're not allowed to go to bed
unless we resolve our arguments, all right?
So, fine.
I'm sorry, okay?
Okay.
Okay, good, 'cause my head has a date
with this medium... medium-firm goose down.
Let me ask you a serious question.
You really think I'm that negative?
Steve?
Steven?
what are you doing?
Making sure we're not being tailed.
Hey, guys.
They just stopped in the middle of the highway.
Well, if we stop, we're gonna blow Kamekona's cover.
We don't stop. Kono, we don't stop.
Just blow right past 'em.
You got it.
Change of plans.
Seller wants us to go to him.
You trust me, right?
Of course.
Good.
Where is he? Where's my brother?
We haven't booked him yet, but that will happen,
unless you can talk some sense into him.
How long has Levi had you running for him?
Kanoa, listen to me.
You got pinched with two bricks of H.
That's 20 years mandatory.
And there's only one way out of it.
Go ahead. Say it.
You got to give up Levi.
Tell them he put you up to this.
No.
I'm no snitch.
You want Levi, you got him.
But my brother--
he don't get charged.
I just want to feel like I'm a priority to him.
Even when we're making love,
I feel like he's not really present.
Maybe that's because I have to schedule an appointment
with you to be there.
I'm sorry I'm so busy juggling a job
and raising your two children.
Maybe if you valued that, I'd give it up more often.
Danny, you haven't exactly been participating.
What's your take on all this?
Uh, my take on, uh, this is,
um-- sorry-- it's stupid,
and I'd like to just go take a nap if that's okay.
So you don't see the value in anything we do here?
I-I don't. Personally, I don't, and I'll...
I'll tell... I'll tell you why.
My-my folks-- they've been married for 40 years.
And, uh, they fought a bunch,
but they never went through anything like this, so...
Danny, this isn't about your parents.
This is about you and Steve.
This is not about me. This is...
Let me... let me... let me just say something, okay?
Just me. My opinion.
I don't know when it became so important
to overanalyze everything
in our lives, to talk about everything
in our relationships, okay? You guys love each other.
That's enough. To me. All right? You know?
You are there for her, she is there for you.
That-that's commitment, right?
But this, this, everybody's poking at everybody.
Poke, poke, poke. It's like an open wound.
You know? And eventually what you're gonna do is
you're gonna say something that you cannot take back. All right?
You're just... you're chipping away at all the good.
And at the end of the day,
there's gonna be nothing left but the bad.
And then let me tell you what happens.
You are sitting alone in a one-bedroom apartment
putting a futon together for your daughter
coming over every Wednesday night.
You got pizza on speed dial. Bad pizza.
Okay? And that's not a place that you want to be.
Please. Trust me.
Well, guys, I, uh...
I really feel like we made some progress here this morning.
That was really good.
Really good stuff.
Hey, come on, Kono.
We need to close some distance here.
We're falling way too far behind.
Hey, I'm pushing this thing as fast as I can.
Hold on. They're pulling in somewhere.
1360 Kalaheo Avenue.
It's a hotel.
I don't like this.
Why the hell is Levi calling an audible this late in the game?
Kanoa?
Hello, brother.
Kanoa, what is this?
This?
This is just business.
See, while you were slinging shave ice,
me and little bro here launched an enterprise of our own.
I hooked him up with a connect out in Cali.
Got him working the distribution lines
so there'd be product to move
when I was released.
He returned the favor
by letting me know that it was you who snitched me out.
So if you knew it was me,
why take out Remy?
Because, way back when,
that punk disrespected us.
I couldn't let it slide.
Before you put me out to pasture,
you figured you'd squeeze me for whatever you could.
Use me to put together some quick cash.
You always were the smartest man in the room.
But you're wrong about one thing.
I'm not gonna kill you.
He is.
You still don't see him for who he is, do you?
He had you running drugs when you were a kid.
Had you do Remy for him so he didn't have to.
And now...
you're gonna kill your own blood for him?
You've been dead to me for a long time.
May as well make it official.
If that's how it's gonna end,
go ahead.
I still love you, baby brother.
That's really touching.
Five-O! Get down on the ground now!
Put your weapon down.
Give me your hands, Kanoa.
He's dead.
Kamekona, you can't be late for school again.
I know. I know. But baby brother needs his breakfast.
I love you, Kanoa.
P.A. agreed to the deal.
You keep your nose clean. You'll be out in two years.
Look, Kamekona,
second chances for guys like you are pretty rare.
So the question is, what are you gonna do with yours?
Now, personally, I'm inclined to believe that
if you just put your head to it,
there's nothing you can't do.
Shave ice.
What about it?
Big margins.
Water's free. Flavoring's cheap.
You start a shave ice company. I'll be your first customer.
What's up, good-lookin'?
Can I get you something?
Hey, buddy. Can I, uh...
I'll just have what he's having.
And a big glass of water.
You got it. Coming up.
Thought you were gonna see Alissa.
Uh, yeah, I was. But I, uh... You know, I blew it off
to, uh... to come and hang with you instead.
You didn't have to do that. I'm fine.
Well, I didn't do it for you.
No, look, you see all these people,
all these nice people sitting around?
You know how much money they spent
to have this dream vacation experience?
I personally don't think it's fair that their experience
be marred by the sight of
a gimpy-ankled man sitting here
eating a $20 hamburger by himself. It's just not right.
So, you know, for their sake, enjoy my company.
See, I thought you were just concerned for me.
Nope.
Here is your water.
Want to hear something crazy?
I don't know how crazy it is, but...
when Rachel and I started having our problems,
she... suggested that we go see a marriage counselor together.
I, of course, said no. I figured,
"Look, we got problems. We'll figure it out ourselves."
But, uh, we never did that, did we?
Well, you think therapy would've saved your marriage?
No.
Probably not.
You know, we had a lot of problems.
Some hers, some mine. But...
the point is, is that she, um...
she was willing to do whatever it took
to save our family, and I guess...
I guess maybe I wasn't. And that...
kind of sticks with me, you know?
You left everything and moved to Hawaii,
so that Gracie would have a father in her life.
And still you question your commitment to your family.
Don't do it. No one can question your commitment to your family.
I don't know. I just...
You know, it's hard not to think about the fact
that things maybe could've been different
had I gone to see that counselor with her. I don't know.
Things would've been different.
Maybe you would never have met me. How about that?
One can dream.
I got to tell you, man. Your ankle aside,
Look around you right now, I mean, there are...
there are much worse places a failed marriage could land you.
You got to admit it. Look at this place.
Yeah. No.
I agree. My failed marriage brings me to Hawaii, and...
my dysfunctional relationship with you brings me here.
We even screwed this up.
Yeah, we didn't get that right, either.
Didn't get this right.
Where's my burger? I'm starving, man.
Here, have half of this. I feel my stomach eating itself.
I'll eat your other half.
Have that one.
All right, thanks, pal.
It's good, huh?
This is the best hamburger I ever had in my life.
Worth the 25 bucks.
It's unbelievable.
This place really has everything.
I used that artisanal soap.
Forget about it. Unbelievable. Unb...
What'd I tell you?
My hands have never been so soft, not in my entire life.
Can I feel?
Yeah, feel this.
Huh? Crazy, right? Right? Feel.
Oh, that is nice.
So...really g-give it a rub.
That is so soft.
Feel up in here, too.
You washed your arms? Like that?
Everything.
That's like the... Like...that's a doctor.
You're like a surgeon.
Like, the fur is now like, um...
It's like down.
It's like down fur.
It's like... It's like the pillows!
Take that one.
Before you think of saying anything,
know this, I have people outside your house right now.
And if they don't hear from me in exactly ten minutes,
she's dead.
What do you want?
