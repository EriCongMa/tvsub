Daddy.
When I was a child,
my father was framed for a crime he didn't commit.
Amanda.
Daddy.
Before he died.
Who are you?
Nolan Ross.
Friend of your father's.
He wanted you to have something.
He left road map for revenge
that led me to the people who destroyed our lifes.
And that is Queen Victoria.
That's Victoria's privileged spawn.
I'm Daniel.
Emily.
Jack Porter is still carrying a torch for little Amanda Clarke.
Sometimes, the innocent get hurt.
Sammy!
Amanda Clarke no longer exists.
But one by one, the guilty will pay.
You could've had anyone,
and you knew she was my closest friend.
Lydia has asked me to announce
that this will be her final weekend in the Hamptons.
Nothing ever goes exactly as you expect.
It's your engagement party.
And mistakes are life and death.
Mom!
Collateral damage is inescapable.
Daniel!
Go, Daniel!
Daniel, you have it. You're almost there.
Go, Daniel!
Go, Daniel!
You got it, Daniel! Come on, Daniel!
Go, go, go! Go, Daniel!
Go, Daniel! Go, Daniel!
Go, Daniel! You have it! You're almost there!
Take it home!
And he missed it.
...For Hampton Bay.
That's gotta hurt.
Emily.
What are you doing over here?
This area is strictly for the commoners.
I like the view.
Mm. So I see.
Don't think I didn't spot you flirting with Daniel Grayson
at the yacht party last week.
What can I say?
He's charming.
He's dangerous.
Come on.
Now I assume you have been studying
the Hamptons group on my facebook page.
Why, is there gonna be a test?
Every bloody day.
Welcome to the V.I.P. Tent.
For you.
So tell me, who is here?
Oh, come on. White one?
Mm. You must remember him.
Nolan Ross-- from the Memorial Day party.
Perennial in the ass?
Gold star.
And that charmer chatting him up
is Bill Harmon,
Head of wall street's most profitable hedge fund.
You'd have to have Nolan's kind of money
for him to even look at you.
Ah, and of course,
situated comfortably in the royalty section,
we have Conrad Grayson and...
Her majesty.
Class dismissed.
I need to do a little networking.
You'll be okay, right?
Yeah, of course. Yeah. Go.
Uncle Bill!
Uncle Bill!
Hello, birthday girl.
Dad, uncle Bill's here.
Look what I have here.
Happy birthday.
Oh! What's his name?
Uh, that is up to you.
What's he look like?
Like a sammy.
Sammy. Okay.
Well, then sammy it is.
Thanks, daddy.
David, I gotta talk to you.
yeah, what is it?
It's about Grayson.
Well, it's so nice to see you.
Nice to see you.
在干嘛呢 美女
Declan.
Little help, please.
The tables aren't gonna bus themselves.
I'm on break.
Yeah, break's over. Let's keep the tables turning.
You should have thought of that
before you fired half the staff last week.
Don't be a smart-ass.
Stowaway. Carl speaking.
看马球赛呢 无聊死了
Yeah, I got the notice.
No, don't bother. I know what I gotta do.
Close up after lunch
and take inventory on everything we got.
what's going on, dad?
Dad?
What's, uh, his problem?
We're closing up early.
Oh, sweet.
No, Declan.
Not sweet.
Yo. That mean I could borrow the boat?
一会儿坐船去兜风啊
Whose boat, Charlotte?
A friend's.
I thought we had all the same friends.
Yeah, well, I'm sick of the same.
I want different.
I can do different.
Love different.
Come on, Daniel! Stay on him!
Go, Daniel!
That's it, Daniel! Go! That's it! You're on him!
You're on him, Daniel! Go!
Another goal for Harris.
Your boy's not looking too good out there today, Grayson.
Mm. It's not even halftime.
There's still plenty of game left.
Care to back that up with a wager?
I stopped playing games with you
When I fired you 18 years ago.
I'd say that particular game
worked out pretty well for both of us.
But if you don't want to throw any more money away
on that son of yours, I can understand.
The only thing you seem to understand, Mr. Harmon,
is how to ruin a perfectly good afternoon.
Just having a little fun, Vic.
Tell you what, I'll even the playing field.
Put your money where your mouth is on Daniel,
and I'll take back the 5 points you're already down.
I'll take that bet.
Hello again, Mr. And Mrs. Grayson.
Ah, Ms. Thorne. What a pleasant surprise.
You remember Emily.
Of course, yeah. The girl next door.
Oh, not for much longer, I'm afraid.
I understand that Lydia and Michael's house
is in multiple offers.
Actually, one of those offers is mine.
Oh. Well, we're gonna keep our fingers crossed for you.
Thanks, but I went in strong.
My realtor is expecting good news.
Gotta like a girl who goes after what she wants.
Bill Harmon.
Emily Thorne.
You watch your money around this one, young lady.
He'll take you for every penny if he can.
Well, I know a good bet when I see one.
And the first half comes to a close.
We welcome everyone out onto the field
For the traditional stomping of the divots.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...
and stomp those divots.
I think I'm in the mood to stomp a few divots.
What's your hurry, party planner?
Nolan, there must be a hundred women here
who would love to play your little games.
I, however, am not one of them.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Hey, it's Jack.
Listen, I thought we had a deal on my boat.
Other buyers are starting to line up.
Ah, the art of the deal.
Tell you what,
I'll have my business manager
wire whatever you're asking into your little bank,
and then we can do the title transfer,
and blah, blah, blah, whenever it's convenient.
It's convenient today.
Aye, aye, captain.
See you soon.
You know Nolan Ross?
Yes, we've been close for a long time.
A bit of an odd bird, that one.
I wouldn't guess he had any real friends at all,
much less one as lovely as you.
Nolan knows when people look at him,
they see dollar signs,
So he's built up a few defense mechanisms.
It's hard to know who to trust when it comes to money.
Couldn't agree more. So who do you trust?
With my money?
Myself since 2008.
I've been sitting in cash and short-term bonds
wondering when that second shoe's gonna drop.
My fund actually made money in 2008.
Really? Well, what do you have, a crystal ball?
And a magic hat.
Bit of free advice?
The other shoe's not gonna drop anytime soon.
You should consider getting back into the market.
Never said I wasn't considering.
Well, then you and I have a lot to discuss.
Call my office.
We'll set a lunch when you're ready.
Loser pays.
Always.
Another shocking turn
in the David Clarke treason trial came today
as financial advisor Bill Harmon took the stand
with searing testimony
against his longtime friend and colleague, David Carke.
Harmon is just one in a long line
Of Grayson Global employees
to detail Clarke's involvement
in the deadly terrorist attack.
Easy, girl.
What's going on with you today?
Off to a rough start, huh?
I was hoping you wouldn't be here to see this.
Sorry to disappoint you.
If it helps, I made a bet that you'd win.
Definitely does not help.
You know, you're making it
very difficult for me to impress you.
I'm already impressed.
Beautiful pony.
Thoroughbred mix, about 7 years old?
You've spent some time around horses.
Yeah, I was the captain of the equestrian club
my semester in Barcelona.
Now who's impressing who?
Would you like to go out sometime?
Riding?
Yeah. Riding or...
just dinner.
Win the match, and it's yes to both.
And if I lose?
Then we'll see.
Come on...
lIt looks like you could use a cool drink.
It might take something
a little stronger than lemonade today.
Thanks for meeting me, Frank.
What were you able to find out?
About your pretty little neighbor?
Filthy rich and squeaky clean as far as I can tell.
Her daddy was a wealthy expat.
Gave her enough to bounce around the globe,
Collecting degrees and doing good deeds.
No romantic scandals or divorces?
Nothing stateside.
There's a few stones left unturned.
I don't expect much.
Why are you so interested in this girl anyway?
Because she's interested in my son.
Need I remind you what happened
With that cocktail waitress
Daniel fell for last summer?
No. I was the one who cleaned up that mess.
I can promise you,
Emily Thorne is no cocktail waitress.
I'm not interested in what she's not.
I want to know who she is.
Well, then perhaps you should go straight to the source...
Ask her yourself.
Frank, did you know?
About Conrad and Lydia.
I'm head of your husband's security.
Of course I knew.
But you kept it a secret from me anyway.
It's my job to keep secrets.
You of all people should appreciate that.
Now please come back for the second half
Of today's hampton bay polo club gala.
Go, Daniel!
Come on now!
Grayson comes back down the field.
Attaboy, Daniel!
A super-shot. Goal!
Wow. There's some really nice detail here, Porter.
I restored every inch of her myself.
Well, now that I own her,
You want to tell me
why you named her "Amanda"?
Just a girl I knew once.
That's it?
That's it.
Take good care of her, man.
I'd love to. Just need someone
to show me the ropes.
Wait, wait, wait. You don't know how to sail?
I was thinking we might make another arrangement.
Unbelievable, man.
I'm--I'm not gonna teach you how to captain my own boat.
Oh, well, actually, I'd rather leave
The whole captain thing to you.
What I want is...
Someone to hang out with this summer,
Like...
Gilligan and The Skipper,
Except this little buddy
Can get you on some killer guest lists.
You're serious.
Why would I want to hang out with you?
'Cause you don't want to see the "Amanda"
on the bottom of the ocean.
Go sit down.
Hello. Anyone in there?
Just a second.
Hey. It's Charlotte.
Declan.
Hey.
Everybody.
I hope it's okay, I brought a few friends.
Yeah, I just--
Boat's not big enough?
The boat's plenty big.
I'm Declan.
I'm Charlotte's boyfriend.
Where are all your customers?
Shut down early.
Health inspector?
Inventory.
Great. Then no one oughta miss this.
Adam, put that back.
Unless, um...
You think we can get away with it.
You kidding? I practically run this place.
It's, uh, it's still rum and diet, right, Charlotte?
Right.
Oh, no. No. You gotta be kidding me.
What's wrong?
The boat's gone.
What do you mean, gone? Like stolen?
I don't know. It should be here.
My brother said he was going to the bank.
Come on, man. Pick up.
What a joke.
We're wasting our time.
You coming?
Sorry.
"My dear Amanda,
"The worst betrayals always come
"From the ones we trust the most.
"If I'm at all culpable for what happened to us,
It's because I gave away my trust too easily."
it's a good age. Not a worry in the world.
Well, she's growing up without a mom.
That's a worry.
Last I checked,
you were working on a plan to change that with Victoria.
What's going on, Bill?
I'm in trouble, David.
You remember the Greenville merger?
Yeah, you made a killing on that.
I had a mole on the board of directors.
My god, Bill.
Tell me you're joking.
I knew that merger was coming.
The S.E.C. Gets ahold of this,
you're going to jail, Bill.
Grayson's security seized my database this morning.
Frank called me.
Grayson wants to cut a deal.
What kind of deal?
Any kind of deal he wants.
Grayson's holding all the cards.
You and David Clarke worked closely together.
Did you consider yourself friends?
I thought we were, yes.
And when did that change?
When I discovered that he had been using
inside information to make illegal trades.
After I turned him in,
I found out he'd been laundering money as well.
And what was the name of the organization
You believe David Clarke was laundering money for?
Americon initiative.
The same Americon initiative
that claimed the responsibility
of blowing up flight 197 last summer?
Yes.
Hello?
is this Emily?
Yes, it is.
Emily, this is Victoria Grayson.
I took a chance and dialed the number
I had for Lydia's old landline.
I hope I haven't disturbed you.
No, not at all.
I wanted to invite you over to the house tomorrow for tea.
Is that something you think you might be able to do?
Yes, that sounds lovely.
Good. I think it's time you and I get to know each other
a little bit better.
I'm looking forward to it.
Till then.
If you invest your money with Grayson,
you're definitely gonna see a return. That's a guarantee.
I came up through the ranks there,
so I know how they work.
Grayson's gone soft over the years.
I still believe in making big trades when it's warranted.
That's right.
Valerie Thomas,
Emily Thorne.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
So bottom line--
You're young,
You're sitting on a huge pile of lazy assets.
Now is the time you should be taking
some calculated risks.
I'm not afraid of taking risks, Mr. Harmon.
I just need to know that you're not rolling the dice blind.
Still need proof of that crystal ball, huh?
For your eyes only.
These are real returns of our top-tier investors
of the last five years.
Now that's double-digit gains across the board.
This...
could be you.
That's incredible.
Can I get a copy?
A good magician never reveals his secrets.
We provide the highest level of confidentiality to our clients.
It's vital to the health of the hedge.
A courtesy you can also expect
should you decide to come aboard.
Well...
You've given me a lot to think about.
Ms. Davis.
Thanks for picking me up
on the street corner like a prostitute.
yeah, all right. Don't send anyone through
for the next half-hour, Sharon.
Well, I'll return calls when I'm back at the office.
So you do still return calls?
Lydia, I understand, you're upset.
I'm not upset.
I'm ruined.
What's this?
Michael's attorney presented these to the judge.
And they triggered the fidelity clause in our prenup.
I get nothing.
The beach house, my jewelry,
The damn dog...
Everything is gone.
I am sorry, Lydia.
Really, I-I am, but...
What can I do about it?
You can write me a check.
A big one.
This is Emily.
Emily, it's Karen
with Kellar house real estate.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
The beach house sold to someone else.
What?
Who?
Where the hell you been all day?
There's a ton of work to do around here.
You really screwed me, you know that?
I promised a girl I'd take her sailing.
Yeah, that's why I asked if I could borrow the boat.
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
I couldn't accommodate your joyride.
You'll just have to find another way to impress her.
What is your problem?
You and dad have been acting like such tools lately.
Are you really that blind to what's going on?
Dad's broke.
I sold the boat
to keep this albatross going.
Is that true?
Cancel that transaction.
It's too late, pop.
The bank already applied the sale to your loan.
Th-then we'll buy it back.
With what?
All of our assets are right here in this room.
Dad, I'm trying to save this place for you.
Nobody asked you to do that, Jack!
I'm the captain of this family, not you.
Jack, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
Well...
Now you do.
拒绝接听
Hello, Jack.
I'm trying to book my next sailing expedition.
But you are making it very difficult.
I told you, if you got in my way,
I would take you down.
You stole my house.
If I hadn't, Victoria would have.
She outbid you with a cash offer this morning.
How could you have possibly known that?
'Cause I hacked the realtor's computer.
I've been tracking the sale all week.
Victoria outbid you,
so I outbid her.
Why is it so important
for you to be a part of this?
When I met your dad,
I'd already been laughed out of every boardroom
in New York.
I was an MIT misfit
with a vision that nobody got but him.
The only reason
Nolcorp exists
Is because your father gave me cash from his personal account
to develop it.
And that's because he believed in me.
I want the deed to the house.
It's already in your name.
Consider it a...
Birthday gift
for Amanda.
Tomorrow is the big day, isn't it?
Daniel mentioned that you were captain
of an equestrian team in barcelona.
Uh, yes, just for a semester.
Oh. When was that, exactly?
2005.
Why do you ask?
I rode steeplechase
when I was in boarding school at montpelier.
I'm curious what else we have in common.
What are some of your other interests?
History for one.
I'm practically obsessed with it.
Funny.
At my yacht party, you were more concerned
with current events it seemed.
Art conservation
is another one of my passions.
That's why I joined New York's landmark preservation society.
My father always said
that our past defines who we are.
I would say our choices are what define us.
Maybe for the lucky.
But sometimes in life, we're not always given a choice.
Emily?
Hi.
Hi. What's going on?
Well, your mother invited me over for tea.
Daniel, for god sake, pull yourself together.
You're a sweaty brute.
My apologies.
Had I known my mother had summoned you,
I'd have looked at least 50% less brutish.
No, it's fine.
I should get going, really.
I have to work out some issues with my realtor.
Things got a little aggressive...
in our bidding war today.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Will you be on the hunt for a fallback rental,
or are you headed back to the city?
Actually, as of this e-mail,
I've just become the official new owner
of the beach house.
That's great news. Congratulations.
Thank you.
Now how about I make good on that date
and take you out to celebrate?
That sounds great. How about tomorrow?
Yeah, tomorrow's perfect. I know just the place.
Come on. I'll walk you out.
Thank you so much for tea, Mrs. Grayson.
I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed this.
Oh, man.
I wish I could've seen the look on victoria's face.
And don't say it was priceless,
because that was bought and paid for, baby.
I'll get you your money back.
No, no, no, keep it.
We'll write it off as an initiation fee
into our little club.
It's not a club, Nolan.
And we are not partners. Do you understand me?
Yeah, sure.
Call it whatever you want.
I'm just happy to be here....
Coach.
Bill Harmon?
What do you need me to do?
You just did it. Now go.
I must say, it was a nice surprise,
hearing from you again so quickly.
What can I say? You made a great case.
And you made a great decision.
I will personally see to it that your portfolio
reflects all the effort and wisdom
that went into building my company.
That's what I'm counting on.
Where your money is, my money is.
You want to make an adjustment in how you're leveraged,
I'll talk you through it.
And if, for any special reason,
You want to go big on a particular stock,
I'll make sure it's worth your while.
Actually, now that you mention it,
what can you tell me about allcom cellular?
Chinese smart phone manufacturer.
Not really huge in the global market,
But I wouldn't count 'em out down the road.
Why?
I want to get in with them, today.
Today.
Any particular reason?
Little bird may have whispered something.
Thank you.
I'll wire the funds this afternoon,
and we can deal with the whole
portfolio transfer next week.
Sounds good.
Hey, pop. You doing all right?
The bottle was half-empty when I started.
Okay. Well, I'll be sure to make note of that in the inventory.
A young man shouldn't have to give up on his dreams
because his old man can't run a business.
I haven't given up on anything, dad.
And neither should you.
You know, when your mother left,
it all went to hell, didn't it?
You must be so ashamed of me.
Dad, I'm not...ashamed of you.
I'm proud of you.
You've kept this place afloat against all odds.
We're gonna make it through this.
We're gonna come out on top, like we always have.
You know what? You're right.
Tomorrow will be better.
You bet it will.
I was just thinking about tonight.
Oh, yeah? What were you thinking?
How do you feel about surprises?
Tonight? Pretty good.
Great, then I won't say anymore.
I'll pick you up at 6:00.
How should I dress?
Surprise me.
Does she suspect anything?
Not a thing.
In other financial news,
wall street is buzzing with rumors
that Allcom Cellular is now a front-runner
for an exclusive contract with innovative chip maker Nolcorp.
Nolan Ross, the notoriously cagey
C.E.O... and founder has promised...
Emily, Bill Harmon.
Listen, that little bird that whispered allcom...
It wouldn't happen to be the gentleman I saw you
hugging outside the cafe this morning?
Well, I'm not saying that it was and I'm not saying that it wasn't,
but what I will say... is that I trust that little bird enough
to double my position.
That's all I need to know.
We're going all in on Allcom.
Get the big dogs in it.
You're sure?
Yeah. Yeah, make the trade.
Everyone in on Allcom, people.
Buy up everything they're selling.
Everything, now.
...A fortune 500 company
with nolan being named one of the richest men in the world.
He's known for a brazen attitude
and a take-no-prisoners leadership style,
and Nolcorp and Ross continue
to push the boundaries of cellular technology.
We take you now, live,
to Nolan Ross and that announcement, as promised.
Listen to this, Valerie.
Greetings, earthlings.
Nolan Ross here with what was supposed to be
but someone somewhere has a big mouth.
I can now confirm that the Allcom rumors
came from a woefully misguided employee.
Allcom is dead to me
and will not be receiving the contract.
What? No.
Instead, I've decided to offer our humble services...
No.
to allcom's soon-to-be chief competitor, unitech.
Well, there you have it.
Expect unitech to open huge tomorrow,
and for those of you who bet big on Allcom Cellular,
get ready to cover some equally heavy losses.
In related tech news, the next generation...
Everybody, listen up.
If you value your jobs, keep your mouths shut.
As far as our investors are concerned,
it's just another sunshiny day.
Word of this leaks, we're finished.
Hello, this is Valerie calling from Bill Harmon's office.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news
regarding a major stock loss today
and its immediate effect on your portfolio.
Please call the office as soon as you can.
I have the information you requested on emily thorne.
Well, what is this, a big "I told you so"?
It was going to be
until I printed out a roster of active board members
of the New York landmark preservation society.
This is a roll call from February.
And there's Emily, just like she said.
And there's Michael Davis.
Lydia's husband?
You remember the rumor that
Michael was sleeping with a young lady this spring?
Here's another roll call from March.
Neither are present.
Coincidence?
It's leaked.
All our investors are pulling out.
We're finished.
How do you want to deal with what's happening downstairs?
Who's downstairs?
Everyone.
Ten well whiskey,
And then, uh, we got eight gin,
12 rum.
We're close.
It's Nolan!
Oh, thanks.
What's up, Nolan?
What's up is, you never return my calls.
I've been a little busy.
Doesn't look like it.
Ah, hey, Sport.
You're the guy who bought the boat.
Proud new papa.
You know he only sold it to you
to pay off the lien on my dad's bar?
No. I did not know that.
So you being around right now
probably isn't the best thing for him.
I get that a lot.
Still closed, Nolan.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, so...
What's say you and I hit up
a little party I caught wind of tonight?
I'm sorry, gilligan. W-we're done hanging out.
Well, what if I said
I'd give you your boat back at the end of the season?
What's he talking about?
Wait, wait, wait.
You're--you're saying that if I pretend to be your friend,
You'll give me my boat back, free and clear?
Well, see, it'd be better if you didn't... have to pretend,
but, uh, that's the gist,
um, plus, all the cool parties.
Oh, he's in.
Dec--
What? That's a hell of a deal.
Come on, and if anyone could use a night off, it's you.
I got it handled here.
He's got it handled.
Yeah.
How come we never go to your house?
Adam, stop.
You're all sticky and sandy.
So let's go rinse off.
we're supposed to be on a break, remember?
And whose bad idea was that?
Charlotte, is that you?
Adam, go.
Go.
Please go.
Okay. Okay.
What is it, mom?
再给我一次机会吧 今晚酒吧只有我一个人
那就今晚见吧 穿得性感点
I hope my mother wasn't too hard on you the other day.
I don't scare too easily.
Does she interrogate all of your dates?
Yeah.
My mom's not really a hands-off kind of person.
Well, at least she got rid of her lie detector.
Kidding. She'll never get rid of that thing.
Hope you're not planning on becoming a comedian.
Maybe in my next life.
My future is pretty well mapped out this time around.
One more year at Harvard Business,
Then it's straight to the boardroom.
Wouldn't be surprised if my dad
already has an office picked out for me.
That sounds...
I know how it sounds.
What about your parents?
Mom, um...
caring, smart,
And my dad, just very... Special.
Lovely people.
So I shouldn't expect an interrogation?
They passed away when I was a kid.
Car crash.
I'm so sorry.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Just me.
Well, you and that beautiful beach house.
Maybe you can set down some roots of your own now.
Yeah, maybe.
Want to come by for the tour?
I'm ready when you are.
So how does it feel to know you'll be
spending the night in your own home?
It's kind of hard to describe, actually.
I had a really good time tonight.
Me, too.
Sam.
Sammy.
No, no, no. No, no. Come on.
Sorry.
We early or are we late?
Surprise!
Welcome to the Hamptons, Emily.
We're here to celebrate with you.
I'm so sorry, Ems.
"How to ruin a perfect first date,"
by Ashley Davenport.
No, no, this is great.
It's just, I'm not big on surprises.
Lesson learned.
Whatever you do, don't take it out on Daniel.
I practically had to force him into doing this.
Speaking of surprises, I am pretty sure
that dog was not on the guest list.
Oh, no, no. Sammy.
And neither is the hottie that he came with.
Surprise.
What do you think you're doing, bringing Jack here?
Jack and I are friends.
You don't have friends.
Neither one of us can afford them. You know that.
Speak for yourself.
You betrayed me.
I thought we had an understanding.
Oh, so did I.
I know it was you who went to the press.
I just can't understand why you'd leak the wrong info
You knew I was going with Unitech.
Yes, but Bill Harmon didn't.
He bet big on Allcom.
$2 billion of his funds' assets
down the drain.
After a financially fatal move in the market today,
Harmon Investments founder
Bill Harmon was swarmed by a mob
of angry investors outside of his office...
This evening,
we expect the imminent collapse of Harmon Investments
And major personal losses for Har--
He's ruined.
Right there.
What can I do for you guys?
You can stay away from Charlotte for starters.
Come on!
Emily Thorne.
I swear to God, I'm not stalking you.
Though I'm not sure the same could be said for my dog.
Congratulations on the...
On the house.
Thank you.
I hope you're not planning on aring it down
and building yourself something like that.
Oh, no. No, not at all.
This... This house stays exactly the same.
Good.
It's nice to know there's somebody else out there
with an appreciation for--for history.
This place sure has a lot of it.
Anyway, um...
I'll let you get back to your party.
If you see Nolan,
just let him know I split.
Yeah, no problem.
It's nice to see you again.
Sammy.
Now who are you gonna stay away from?
I-I can't...
What's that? I can't hear you?
Your mother.
You're a dead man.
Get outta here. Come on. Let's get outta here.
Go! Go! Go!
Stay on your own side of the economy,
you little dock rat.
Hey! Get away from him!
Hey, Dec.
Dec, who are those guys?
No one.
Let me help you up.
You're drunk.
Oh, and you're beat to hell.
But they'll get what's comin' to them.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, they'll get girls and they'll get cars,
they'll get more money than they can spend.
You know what I'm gonna get? Crap.
'Cause I'm a loser, dad, just like you.
Declan, listen...
Victoria, it's Frank.
I found an anomaly in Emily Thorne's public record.
What kind of anomaly?
From ages 16 to 18,
it's like she didn't exist.
Every piece of information you'd expect to find on her
was sealed by the court.
I want you to start following her.
I want to know everywhere she goes.
I want to know everyone she sees.
Something's not right here. I can feel it.
Bye, Emily.
Bye.
"Where we love is home--
Home that our feet may leave, but not our hearts."
Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Maybe I should've been a poet.
Well, maybe you still can be.
Good night.
Good night.
Trust is a difficult thing,
whether it's finding the right people to trust...
Or trusting the right people will do the wrong thing.
Dad!
Oh, God.
No, no.
No, no, dad.
Oh, god. No, no.
No, no.
Declan!
Jack, what do I do?
Call 9-1-1.
Okay.
Go!
We need help.
I don't know. I don't know. He's not breathing.
But trusting your heart...
is the riskiest thing of all.
I only have a few minutes.
Bill Harmon knows about us.
I think he's gonna tell Conrad.
I-I don't understand. How did this happen?
I trusted the wrong person.
In the end,
the only person we can truly trust
is ourself.
