mrs. dilaurentis has offered to let us stay with her .
you &apos;re gonna sleep in ali &apos;s old bed ?
no ! hell no . i &apos;m not moving in there .
em , you have to .
you knew i wasn &apos;t his father .
i gave myself the answer that i wanted .
you let me fall in love with him .
i &apos;m sorry .
my mom used to play this song all the time .
&quot; a &quot; is telling you to ditch eddie lamb
and go for dr. palmer .
how much longer do you need me to keep this a secret ?
we have to face facts .
we &apos;re not gonna be together next year .
they &apos;re alleging that i bullied mona into giving her confession .
what does that mean ?
your mother doesn &apos;t have a lawyer .
how jealous were you tonight ?
it definitely looks like somebody used this
as their temporary home .
should we call the police ?
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re long gone .
do you actually think she &apos;s been living in that crawl space ?
aria , there was a sleeping bag .
but napping isn &apos;t living .
unless you &apos;re a reptile , which kind of describes cece .
least the cece that mrs. dilaurentis remembers .
but not just mrs. d ,
even shana &apos;s scared of this girl .
yeah , well i &apos;m scared of shana .
she &apos;s not the one who used jenna &apos;s head
as batting practice at your birthday party .
yeah , why is cece going after jenna ?
why would she go after any of us ?
we had nothing to do with her getting kicked out of college .
we have no idea what ali could &apos;ve told her .
what could ali have possibly said that would make cece
hate us enough to drill holes under ali &apos;s house
and stare up emily &apos;s skirt ?
how am i supposed to live in that house ?
hang out on the second floor .
and wear underwear at all times .
i &apos;m eating this .
hey . where you been ?
uh , with my mom .
she met another lawyer .
how &apos;d it go ?
not great .
they &apos;re all just bottom @-@ feeders
trying to make a name for themselves .
there are other ones .
em , she &apos;s met all of them .
they don &apos;t care what happens to her .
she &apos;s just ... case number 79 .
your mom &apos;s gonna find somebody who really cares about her .
she already found someone who cared .
why can &apos;t you tell your mom to ask the judge
to get back on that case ?
&apos;cause &quot; a &quot; took her down , hanna .
spencer , talk to her .
please .
my mom trusts her . she needs her .
i know , and my mom is not deserting her .
she just-- she has to figure out
what kind of role she can play
without compromising your mom &apos;s defense .
what is she doing here ?
who ?
lieutenant tanner .
why is she at our school ?
doubt it &apos;s for the baked ziti .
hello , ladies . may i join ?
i hear you and your mother moved in with a neighbor .
must be nice not having to use a desk as an ironing board .
have you been back to your house since the accident ?
no , i haven &apos;t .
well i &apos;m just here , ladies ,
to remind you that the local p.d.
still investigating .
did they find out who was driving that car ?
no .
not yet .
oh , but they did find something interesting
while they were sorting through the wreckage .
what ? what was it ?
a shoe .
a muddy shoe ...
that , believe it or not ,
matches the shoeprints
from the wilden crime scene ...
which falls under my jurisdiction .
do they know whose shoe it is ?
well we spoke to your mother , emily .
we know it &apos;s not hers .
and we have ways of testing these things out .
you know , d.n.a. and stuff .
something wrong , hanna ?
no , i &apos;m just--
i have to use the restroom .
geez , i hope i didn &apos;t ruin anyone &apos;s lunch .
hanna .
hanna , come on , don &apos;t let tanner freak you out
about a muddy shoe .
it &apos;s probably not even why she came here .
oh , really ? it was about the baked ziti ?
no , look , &quot; a &quot; put that shoe in emily &apos;s house
&apos;cause mona made a crazy move .
why does &quot; a &quot; care what mona says ?
because her confession screwed with &quot; a &apos;s &quot; perfect plan
to frame your mother .
yeah , and tanner &apos;s just fishing to see
if we were the ones who put mona up to it .
she &apos;s been after me since that &quot; guilty &quot; video
was delivered to the police .
okay , she &apos;s just trying to scare us into spilling something .
yeah , well it worked . my breakfast .
we need to put cece on tanner &apos;s radar .
how are we supposed to do that ?
just invite her into the crawlspace ?
no , we are gonna go into the crawlspace
this afternoon , after school ,
and hopefully find some proof
that cece &apos;s back in town and living down there .
if we go down there , mrs. d. is gonna start asking questions .
well mrs. d. isn &apos;t gonna be there
&apos;cause hanna &apos;s going shopping with her .
for what ? things to wear while visiting my mother
on a chain gang ?
no . tonight &apos;s dance .
spencer ! i am not going to that hoedown !
okay ? i cannot leave my mother alone .
you don &apos;t have to go to the hoedown .
you just have to waste an hour or two with mrs. d.
trying on bolo ties , okay ?
and you two are gonna meet me underneath the house at 4 : 00 .
okay .
you okay ?
uh , yeah .
yeah , no-- i &apos;m gonna meet you guys under the house . okay ?
hey , there .
is tonight still happening ?
tonight ?
the dance .
we don &apos;t have to go .
not really good at line dancing , anyway .
yeah , i don &apos;t know . uh , maybe ?
i have a lot of stuff going on , but ...
i &apos;ll call you .
what &apos;s that ?
a recommendation letter .
nice . zoe came through ?
yeah .
it &apos;s long .
and gushing .
yeah . that &apos;s how zoe talks .
really ? about every volunteer ?
her spirit made my heart race ?
she &apos;s poetic .
she &apos;s into you .
she &apos;s being supportive .
emily , i &apos;ve been to weddings
where people don &apos;t say stuff like this in their vows .
i have to get to class .
aria .
what are you doin &apos; here ?
i was gonna offer you a lift home ,
but it looks like--
yeah , i drove myself .
uh , wanna take a detour for a coffee ?
i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll tailgate you .
love to , but i-- i have so much stuff i have to do today .
that &apos;s cool .
i just wanted to pass on a name
of a hot @-@ shot attorney who &apos;s a friend of the family .
oh , that &apos;s so sweet of you .
i don &apos;t know what happened
between spencer &apos;s mom and hanna &apos;s , but--
think , um , mrs. marin &apos;s already found somebody else .
yeah .
do you two @-@ step ?
in a parking lot ?
in a barn in watertown tonight .
the school &apos;s throwing this western thingy .
would you wanna go ?
yes .
okay .
what ?
you change your mind ?
no , that ... was just so easy .
what &apos;s wrong with easy ?
nothing .
it &apos;s ... just been a long time
since i could go to a school dance with somebody that i &apos;m ...
dating .
what time should your date pick you up ?
busy ?
i should be .
what is that ?
well , i did what you suggested
and i reached out to my supervisor in haiti .
she wrote this .
are you growing a beard ?
what ?
no .
this is glowing .
what &apos;s the problem .
is it too glowing ?
i mean does it sound like my mother wrote it ?
emily , there are people with real problems in the world ,
and getting a glowing college recommendation
isn &apos;t one of them .
sorry i bothered you .
emily--
i have a lot on my mind right now .
i &apos;m sorry . i shouldn &apos;t have snapped at you .
is this about aria ?
sorry , i shouldn &apos;t have asked you that .
maggie is moving across the country
and taking malcolm with her .
w--how can she just do that ?
i mean , you &apos;re malcolm &apos;s father .
i &apos;d like to be the first to tell aria ,
so i &apos;d really appreciate if you wouldn &apos;t say anything .
hanna , hey .
do you need a ride ?
uh , no . i &apos;m going shopping
at macy &apos;s with mrs. dilaurentis .
what--you &apos;re shopping with alison &apos;s mom ?
well i can &apos;t with my own .
her ankle brace would go off
any time she opens a window too fast .
right .
well , okay , then i guess i &apos;ll just come by
and pick you up for the round @-@ up .
no , we don &apos;t have to go to that--
actually , we do .
your mom texted me during chem .
she told me to grab you at 8 : 00 .
it was an order .
she wants you to live your life , han .
whatever .
come on , giddy @-@ up , little doggie .
it was in hanna &apos;s locker .
why would cece use an envelope
from the place where she used to work ?
she wouldn &apos;t .
so you don &apos;t think it &apos;s cece ?
i don &apos;t know who it is .
well it &apos;s just such a careless move .
do you think she wants us to find out it &apos;s her ?
there are easier ways to do it .
well why is she suddenly gifting you and hanna--
spencer , i don &apos;t feel like asking questions ,
and not when i &apos;m getting answers .
yeah , and they also feed turkeys
lots of tasty treats before they chop their heads off .
i just don &apos;t understand why hanna would be given a gift
the same day her mother &apos;s muddy shoe suddenly shows up .
what is it ?
* anytime *
who &apos;s singing ?
* you &apos;re feeling blue *
my mother .
what ? where did you get this ?
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t ... know .
you didn &apos;t put this in here ?
take it out !
toby , please ! please take this out right now !
hey , how you doin &apos; ? can--can i get a water ?
are you looking for me ?
look , i don &apos;t know who you are
or why you find me so damn interesting ,
but if you don &apos;t stop ,
you &apos;re gonna be one sorry stalker .
i &apos;ll go to palmer tonight .
i @-@ if he can remember where he stored the rest of these--
toby , palmer is not a reliable source .
okay , he thought that i was your mother !
he thought that mrs. dilaurentis was--
he may remember where he kept the rest of his sessions .
look , this is a classic &quot; a &quot; move .
i mean , if &quot; a &quot; wasn &apos;t being devious ,
why did she have to break into your car
to deliver this to you ?
she was probably hoping you &apos;d hear it
and you &apos;d wrap your truck around a tree .
i &apos;m gonna see palmer tonight .
you wanna come with me or not ?
not .
i &apos;m meeting aria and emily .
why ?
so we can find signs of cece
in that frickin &apos; crawlspace .
what are you doing ?
who are you calling ?
palmer .
toby , do you understand what is happening ?
you are completely under &quot; a &apos;s &quot; spell .
can we please , please ,
just take a breath and try to prove that cece
is &quot; a &quot; before we make another move ?
saratoga gardens .
how may i direct your call ?
hello ?
hello ?
where &apos;s spencer ?
always has the best flashlight .
isn &apos;t she the one that said to meet at 4 : 00 ?
yeah , she &apos;ll be here .
when was the last time you spoke with ezra ?
it &apos;s been a while . why ?
you should call him .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
he just mention that he &apos;s been trying to reach you .
he has .
but i can &apos;t do that to jake .
i spent our first three dates
trying to convince him that i was available ,
and now i-- now i finally feel like i am .
what is that ?
a button .
do you think it belongs to red coat ?
hi . sorry i &apos;m late .
yeah , so are we . you could &apos;ve announced yourself .
hi , i &apos;m spencer . i &apos;m climbing into the crawlspace .
where have you been ?
i was with toby . just--
stuff &apos;s going on .
yeah , there &apos;s been a lot of stuff going on for a while now ,
ever since he gave &quot; a &quot; that lair .
have you found anything ?
a button .
lemme see .
told you she has the best flashlight .
i thought mrs. d. was with hanna .
没错 迪劳伦提斯夫人和我在一起 - - 汉娜
wait , go back . how many knitting needles were there ?
does there need to be more than one ?
i &apos;m just saying there could
have been more than one person up there .
there was one person , one heavy @-@ footed person
who knew exactly where those holes were .
em , this could help us .
if that person is cece , we can trap her--
maybe with the diva dish envelope ;
when you go back there , you should--
if i go back there , it &apos;s to pack up my suitcase , okay ?
i &apos;m not sleeping in that house again .
i &apos;ll move in here .
moving in where ?
here . your bedroom , this couch--
anywhere where there &apos;s carpeting .
do you wanna do this tonight ?
yeah . is that a problem ?
who were you talking to upstairs ?
toby . why ? what did i miss ?
what did we miss ?
spence , it &apos;s like you &apos;re living a double life .
what makes you think i &apos;m living a double life ?
because i have and i know exactly what it looks like .
every time toby calls ,
you leave the room , your mood changes .
are you pregnant ?
shut up , hanna .
okay , it &apos;s like you &apos;re here but you &apos;re not .
we get it . we understand you have a boyfriend .
we &apos;ve all had them .
yeah , even emily .
shut up , hanna .
okay but we don &apos;t put anyone above our friendship .
i &apos;m not putting him above you guys .
i just--toby is--
he &apos;s dealing with some really serious stuff .
spencer ,
hanna &apos;s mom might be going to prison , like , for real .
emily &apos;s got a car parked in her living room ,
and i nearly lost an eye this afternoon .
i think ...
all of our stuff ranks on the &quot; serious &quot; charts .
i promised him .
we know .
spence , what &apos;s the deal ?
is toby working with &quot; a &quot; again ?
no .
but &quot; a &quot; is giving him gifts , too .
toby &apos;s mother might have been murdered .
yeah , i know he &apos;s not well . you told me that earlier .
it is just a quick question !
could you please just get someone
to get dr. palmer on the phone ?
fine , thanks . you &apos;ve been a big help .
well , at least i know you didn &apos;t lose it .
or throw it in the river .
yeah . um ...
i &apos;m sorry , ezra . things have just been ...
pretty busy .
no worries .
you &apos;re here now .
true .
i @-@ i can &apos;t really talk right now .
w--is there another time
we can get together ?
i have something i--
would rather not say it over the phone .
hey .
h !
um , i @-@ i just sat down and then i saw ezra from--
um , ezra , this is jake . jake , ezra .
nice to meet you .
yeah , you too .
so i should actually get going .
i &apos;ve got a lot of work to do .
but ... it was nice meting you .
wow , that was weird .
i--i had no idea that he was gonna be here .
don &apos;t sweat it .
it &apos;s a ... small town .
what &apos;s this ?
open it .
you did not buy me--
try &apos; em on .
here ?
yeah . i &apos;ll help you .
seriously , though , how &apos;d you know my size ?
it &apos;s a gift .
and a great party trick .
how does it feel ?
i think people are staring at us .
the boot .
it &apos;s perfect .
toby can &apos;t trust &quot; a &quot; anymore .
i made that really clear .
how can i help ?
um , just grab my stuff in the bathroom .
oh , and check the shower .
yeah .
stop moving .
i can &apos;t help it . it tickles .
get over it .
you need to break up with ben .
what ?
why ?
because you deserve better .
he &apos;s a flathead . and deep down , you know it &apos;s not right .
sometimes it feels right .
please . mushy squash .
he &apos;s not that bad .
that &apos;s what &apos;s left on the buffet table
after everyone &apos;s made their choices , em .
you don &apos;t make decisions ,
and that &apos;s what you &apos;ll end up with .
ben really cares about me .
and i don &apos;t want to hurt him .
stop taking care of everyone but yourself .
alison--
you need to be careful at what you &apos;re good at , hon ,
&apos;cause you &apos;ll spend the rest of your life doing it .
and if you need me to do the deed , i &apos;m happy to .
what &quot; deed &quot; ?
breaking up with ben .
i &apos;ve done it for lots of people .
that &apos;s so wrong .
who would ask you to do something like that ?
sometimes people don &apos;t have a choice .
friend of mine was involved
with this really scary dude .
she couldn &apos;t do it , so i stepped in .
but the bitch didn &apos;t tell me that he had a gun--
which he pulled on me .
what ? ! who !
a boy at our school has a gun ?
you don &apos;t know him .
he doesn &apos;t go to our school ...
anymore .
other foot .
hey . this is everything .
what &apos;s wrong ?
did you know that ali once had a gun pulled on her ?
what ?
ali used to help people break up with their boyfriends
when they didn &apos;t want to deal with it themselves .
what if that was a favor she did for cece ,
and that creepy dude was wilden ?
whoa , emily , slow down .
no , w @-@ when i saw that photo
of wilden with his arms around ali and cece ,
i assumed that he was seeing ali .
what if cece was dating jason and wilden ?
so what if she was ?
maybe when she came back to rosewood ,
he tried to hook up with her ,
and the only way to get rid of him was to kill him ?
hello ?
where are you ?
i &apos;m not waiting here forever .
and i sure as hell am not going back to rosewood .
call me .
should &apos;ve come here on horseback .
oh , come on . go with it , han .
well , what &apos;ll it be , ma &apos;am ?
can i get you a nice , tall glass of sarsaparilla ?
do you wanna dance ?
what ?
dance with me .
okay , are you out of your mind ?
why would i wanna dance with you ?
because i put that envelope in your locker .
i know your mom &apos;s innocent .
who are you ?
i was at the lake that night .
wilden called us to tow his car out .
look , my family owns the garage on the corner of broadmoor and lasher .
wait , you were at the lake that night ?
yeah , your mom was there talking to wilden .
she didn &apos;t see me , but i saw her drive off .
i heard gunshots ...
after i saw your mom drive away .
and i saw someone running through the woods .
who ? who did you see ?
i don &apos;t know , but it was a girl .
hey , hanna .
you , uh , hate this , we can switch .
i got lemonade , so ...
um , actually can you hold that for one second ?
i just--
i have to dance with--
travis .
yeah. one of aria &apos;s ...
brother &apos;s friends from lacrosse .
it was a bet .
so , come on , travis . let &apos;s dance .
why &apos;d you wait so long ?
it &apos;s complicated .
i know complicated .
look , my dad and wilden-- there &apos;s bad blood between them .
my dad could &apos;ve looked just as guilty as your mom looks now .
that still doesn &apos;t get you off the hook .
it was me and a dead body .
who &apos;s gonna believe me when i say i saw someone
running through the woods ?
was that somebody a blonde ?
it was very dark , but i think so .
where &apos;d the cash come from ?
when i saw his body , i--
i panicked . i left my truck at the lake .
then it showed up later at the garage .
that envelope was on the seat ,
so whoever delivered that thought it would shut me up .
well it did .
howdy , caleb . how &apos;s it going ?
what are they serving ?
uh , i would just stick with water .
everything else tastes like cough syrup .
where &apos;s hanna ?
she &apos;s dancing off some bet with one of your brother &apos;s teammates .
you know anything about that ?
oh--yeah , mike is so immature .
i &apos;ll have a water . please .
it &apos;s not as hard as it looks .
my father taught me how to two @-@ step .
he learned at the base .
in texas , it &apos;s part of basic training .
well we should all be drafted
because i don &apos;t know the difference between a two @-@ step and a polka .
but ... you &apos;ll lead ,
right , toby ?
sure .
what &apos;s a polka ?
did you know that paige was gonna be here ?
um , sorta .
she didn &apos;t know that i was , though .
i don &apos;t get it .
if you were so scared of looking guilty ,
why would you leave your truck at the lake ?
i @-@ i freaked out , okay ?
it was stupid , i know .
but i can &apos;t hide that money anymore .
your mom needs it .
no .
you have to speak to the police .
look , i @-@ i &apos;m not gonna sell out my own family to save yours .
all right , the police should &apos;ve figured this out by now .
well they haven &apos;t !
and now they have physical proof
that my mom was there at the lake that night .
and she &apos;s looking guiltier every minute .
so what are you gonna do about it ?
i &apos;ve done everything that i &apos;m gonna do .
so this kid falls out of the sky now ?
hanna , &quot; a &quot; delivered that truck .
&quot; a &quot; put that money in there .
how do you know this kid isn &apos;t working for &quot; a &quot; ?
how can you trust this guy ?
you &apos;re right . i can &apos;t .
but i &apos;m gonna have to .
帕默的旧车在东盘山路1071号 -a
wanna dance ?
sure .
hey , there .
hi .
jake , what can i do for you ?
you could start by giving us a little bit more space .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i &apos;m guessing being a chaperone wasn &apos;t mandatory tonight .
now you gotta have better things to do
on a friday night , dude .
look , if you think i &apos;m here
because--
i know why you &apos;re here .
and i know why you &apos;re hurting , man ...
but you gotta let her move on .
i &apos;ll take two lemonades , please .
did emily say anything to you ?
about what ?
nothing .
hey , look , if you don &apos;t wanna dance , we don &apos;t--
no , no , no . i do . i do .
just--
i got an address now for palmer &apos;s car
and i wanna go there .
what ? where did you get that ?
it &apos;s less than two miles away from here ,
and if--if those last sessions
with my mother are in there--
is this what was on your phone ?
another gift ?
toby , who are you here with , me or &quot; a &quot; ?
why are you trying to keep me from knowing the truth ?
it &apos;s like i bring this up and i get shut down .
no , i &apos;m not shutting you down , okay ?
i just don &apos;t wanna see this thing blow up in your face .
i know what i &apos;m doing .
no , you don &apos;t .
that &apos;s the thing . none of us do .
okay , we &apos;re all just trying to make this up
as we go along ,
but everybody thinks that you &apos;re playing with f--
who &apos;s &quot; everybody &quot; ?
who else knows about my mother ?
did you tell your friends ?
why would you do that ?
now that-- that will be the last text that i ever get .
that &apos;s for the best .
okay , i didn &apos;t mean to--
i trusted you .
i know .
but keeping this a secret has meant
that i &apos;ve had to choose between you and them .
right .
and you chose them .
hey , hey , did you drive here ?
yeah . why ? do you need a ride ?
no , i need you to follow toby .
here , just gimme those plates , okay ?
i &apos;ll feed hanna .
w @-@ what is going on ?
i think &quot; a &apos;s &quot; trying to set him up .
but i need you to go now , quick ,
before he pulls out of the lot , please .
go .
okay , okay , okay .
hey . who was that guy hanna was dancing with earlier ?
i didn &apos;t see him .
uh , have you spoken to ezra ?
um , no .
he &apos;s right over there .
yeah , emily , i know .
i just don &apos;t want a repeat of this afternoon .
we had the weirdest pile @-@ up today at the brew .
i mean , ezra just--
he looked like this wet , sad puppy , and jake--
did you ever even call him ?
i can &apos;t , emily , i told you .
how is jake supposed to believe that it &apos;s really over ?
okay , this isn &apos;t about jake .
he &apos;s losing malcolm .
first he loses you ,
and now maggie &apos;s moving his kid across the country .
he &apos;s in a really bad place .
that &apos;s what he wanted to talk about ?
you left before we could finish .
i told you everything i knew .
this money is not gonna help my mom
or you .
you have to give it to the police .
do not give me that .
i know how it feels to be blackmailed .
okay , you can &apos;t wish it away .
you have to do something .
i &apos;m not selling out my own dad .
travis , my mom still believes that
the truth will get her out of this .
and you &apos;re holding that truth .
look , i know you &apos;re scared .
but you wouldn &apos;t have come to me
if you weren &apos;t ready to do the right thing .
hey , where the hell is hanna ?
i don &apos;t know , but i think i saw &quot; red coat . &quot;
what ? wait , where ? was it cece ?
i don &apos;t know . it was a flash , and then she disappeared .
i looked up for a second right over there .
there she is .
i see someone ... heading down the main road .
oh , excuse me . can we please borrow your truck ?
uh , no .
last hay ride is at 9 : 30 .
no , no , no . we don &apos;t want a hay ride .
we just--we need to catch up with our friend .
well i &apos;m sorry , pippy longstocking ,
but , uh , i &apos;m done for the night .
ezra , i &apos;m so sorry .
i had no idea what was going on .
it was emily who told you ?
she had to .
look , i @-@ i thought that you were calling me because--
we don &apos;t have to do this now .
no , if i would &apos;ve known--
it &apos;s okay , aria .
i have no right to be invading your life with my problems .
you should get back to jake .
hurry !
i @-@ i can &apos;t get it into first gear .
is your foot on the brake ?
no , it &apos;s on the clutch .
do you wanna try this ?
