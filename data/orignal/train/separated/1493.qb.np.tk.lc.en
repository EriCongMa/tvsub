hi , there .
i &apos;ll be your server for tonight .
my name is brian if you guys need anything .
what &apos;s your name if we don &apos;t need anything ?
patricia .
you &apos;re quick , patricia !
thanks . so , our specialty cocktail for tonight
is a basil @-@ infused mojito .
oh , yum ! we &apos;ll take three .
uh , no . that &apos;s okay . i &apos;m good .
come on , now . join us for a specialty cocktail
on our specialty evening .
yeah .
three , please .
okay .
if you don &apos;t drink it , someone will .
well , that brian sure is a cutie , huh ?
i &apos;d kill to have those lips . i mean on me .
i mean i want his lips on my mouth .
uh , can we just cut to the chase ?
he &apos;s got great lips .
no , no , no , no , no . what are we doing here ?
what is this about ?
nothing ! we just wanted to have a fun night out
with our daughter .
yeah ! just think of us as your friends .
yeah !
i don &apos;t have 45 @-@ year @-@ old friends .
well , you don &apos;t have 45 @-@ year @-@ old parents yet , either , honey ,
so calm down .
haley has no plan for her future whatsoever .
she &apos;s living in our basement ,
taking community @-@ college classes , and , well , meandering .
so we &apos;re gonna take her out . we &apos;ll have some fun .
and then gently ease her
into a friendly conversationabout her future .
as opposed to the approach that we &apos;ve taken in the past .
is this what you &apos;re gonna do with your life --
sleep late and take a selfie ? !
why are you always criticizing me ? !
is this really how you want to start the day ? !
my day started 5 hours ago .
i am under a lot of pressure !
how ? ! how ? ! you take three classes a week ,
and you miss half of them !
the parking is tricky !
morning , sunshine . i saved you some lunch .
i get it , okay ? ! i &apos;m lazy ! god !
you know what drives me crazy ?
getting these customer @-@ satisfaction calls during dinner .
they change the oil on your car ,
they want a love letter !
i know . i &apos;m waiting for a call from my doctor &apos;s office --
&quot; please rate your prostate exam .
would you say you were satisfied ? &quot;
i hope you weren &apos;t .
&quot; i hope you weren &apos;t . &quot;
that &apos;s a good one , gloria !
do you know how hard it is
to be funny in a second language , jay ?
esta hermosa dama es muy buena .
ay , darlene , you &apos;re learning spanish ?
yes , shorty and i have been taking classes .
we &apos;re getting good .
oh , yeah .
i es maravilloso !
you said &quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; right ?
my italian helps me .
why the sudden interest in spanish ?
well , actually , there &apos;s something we have to tell you ,
you know ? all right . how &apos;s this ? we &apos;re-
we &apos;re moving to costa rica !
yeah !
what ? !
when ?
in a couple of weeks . the cost of living is so low down there ,
you know ? we found this beautiful place on the water .
it &apos;s got its own private beach .
bathing suits are optional .
but encouraged .
ay , i &apos;m going to miss you guys .
don &apos;t worry about it . i give it three months , tops .
you hate the beach . and you know how humid it is down there ?
i love the steam room at the club .
it &apos;s the same thing , except i don &apos;t have to see you
sitting there like a pile of melted ice cream .
&apos;cause you &apos;re tom selleck in a towel .
i &apos;m just ready for an adventure .
i want to try something new .
stick around here . pick up a check every now and then .
why do you always have to be so negative ?
i think it &apos;s great .
no , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m surprised , that &apos;s all .
let &apos;s toast this amazing new chapter of your lives .
to mosquitoes the size of your fist .
this is why all your friends move away .
to us , alone at last .
we both look very handsome tonight .
you know , if you -- if you &apos;d just said
that i looked handsome , i would have said , &quot; so do you . &quot;
i couldn &apos;t take that chance .
i wanted to get off on the right foot .
mitchell and i desperately need
a romantic night out to reconnect .
yeah . i don &apos;t --
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s the stress of planning a wedding ,
but we &apos;ve been a little tense with each other lately , huh ?
even our friend j &apos;marcus said how bitchy we &apos;ve been .
what -- when did he say that ?
oh , at pepper &apos;s party
that night you wore those pants that don &apos;t fit you anymore .
oh , right . and you brought that bad wine that everybody hated .
see ? we really need this .
we really do .
oh , you know , uh , pepper said
that for our cake tasting ,
we needed to have --
remember our rules -- no wedding talk , no lily talk .
i &apos;m sorry . no , you &apos;re right .
so , just gonna ...
should we hear the specials again ?
we can &apos;t ask him a third time .
you know what i might try when i &apos;m down there ?
surfing .
so it &apos;s gonna be a closed casket .
my turn .
what are you talking about ? i just sunk the 3 ball .
then you moved the cue ball with your stick
while you were telling me how you were gonna move away
from southern california to try surfing .
i didn &apos;t touch the cue ball .
yeah , i know . but you did .
you &apos;re calling me a cheater ? you ?
the guy on the golf course who can &apos;t seem to count higher than 5 ?
maybe i can &apos;t keep track of my shots
because somebody won &apos;t stop talking .
it is in my nature to comment on
the bizarre and unusual things i see in the world ,
like that convulsion you call a golf swing .
you know what ? i &apos;m done here .
no , i &apos;ve done .
i will not have my integrity questioned here .
i was a marine .
i served with guys who died .
of old age !
you never left the states !
are you saying i didn &apos;t serve my country ?
which one , america or costa rica ?
what &apos;s with you and costa rica ? !
it &apos;s a terrible idea !
you get into things without thinking ,
and you need to be rescued ,
like that time you bought that car
that was supposed to turn into a boat !
yeah ?
it turned into a reef !
that &apos;s &apos; cause you left your door cracked open !
yes , it was my fault .
mark my words --
costa rica is another amphibicar
at the bottom of a lake .
only this time , i won &apos;t be bailing you out !
who asked you ? !
darlene , we &apos;re going !
wha-- wha-- what do you mean , we &apos;re going ?
gracias , gloria .
that was a lovely dinner .
and you are an incredible woman for putting up with this gringo !
come on !
what happened ?
good luck in costa rica !
aw , thanks , jay .
he didn &apos;t mean it !
i know ! i &apos;m trying to defuse the tension .
here we go , guys .
oh , yeah !
three more mojitos .
yum !
aren &apos;t these yum ?
i didn &apos;t even drink the first one .
are you sure ? &apos; cause i don &apos;t think it drank itself .
no , it did not .
look , i have no problem drinking .
i can literally do it standing on my head .
but , &quot; a , &quot; not with my parents ,
and plus , also , i needed to stay sharp ,
because they were obviously up to something ,
and i was in no mood .
i barely got 10 hours of sleep last night .
so , i &apos;ll go get you guys some more water ,
and your food should be out in just a few minutes .
thanks so much , pal . we appreciate it .
he seems like a real go @-@ getter , huh ?
oh , &apos; cause he goes and gets things ?
i wonder what he wants to do with his life .
i wonder that about people all the time .
i think that &apos;s very common ,
to wonder about other people &apos;s aspirations .
i do it all the time .
yeah , you do .
yeah . here we go .
hey , brian , you &apos;re a young guy .
wha-- wha-- what do you want to do after this ? what &apos;s your plan ?
uh , to be perfectly honest ,
i &apos;m probably gonna go home , watch a movie , and get high .
you guys looking for something to do ?
no . no . no .
oh . i mean , i think i got extra .
no , no , that &apos;s --
i @-@ i think he meant your plan for your life ,
not -- not just tonight .
oh . i want to be a screenwriter .
ambitious . - and -- and so interesting .
isn &apos;t that interesting , haley ?
sure .
you should tell him what you &apos;re doing .
oh , you mean after we all go get high with brian ?
that &apos;s not happening .
i &apos;m sorry . i meant that --
no , i know what you meant .
hey , brian , could you give us a second ?
uh , ye-- sure .
so this is what this whole night &apos;s about --
the drinks , the pretending to be my friend ?
we are your friend .
honey , we care about you .
and we want to make sure that you -- you &apos;ve got a plan ,
&apos;cause it seems like you &apos;re meandering .
no . sweetie , don &apos;t just start texting
because you don &apos;t like the conversation .
here .
what is this ?
that &apos;s a blog that i &apos;ve been doing .
i &apos;m really liking my photography ,
and people always say that they like the way that i dress ,
so i &apos;ve been posting pictures of my outfits on this site .
i know it &apos;s not a huge money @-@ maker right now ,
but i do get money whenever someone clicks on a link
and buys something that i wore .
i &apos;m gonna take a business class next semester ,
which i &apos;m hoping will help me turn all of this
into becoming a stylist .
i have 1,200 followers .
most are women who want to know what to wear .
some are men who want to know what i &apos;m wearing ,
but , you know , i &apos;m trying to figure a way
to block all of the pervs .
so , yeah . i guess that is my plan .
it &apos;s amazing .
we are so proud of you .
don &apos;t even , guys . you always assume the worst of me .
honey --
no , you guys sit here
acting like we &apos;re drinking buddies , judging me ,
when i have a better handle on my future
than either one of you did at my age .
you ? you wanted to be a magician .
and you were changing your major every three minutes ,
according to grandpa --
who , by the way ,
has been drinking with me for years
because he loves me ,
and he thinks i say funny things when i &apos;m buzzed .
well , apparently , the situation in syria is worsening .
i know .
in fact , now u.n. evidence suggests that assad was --
are you reading this off your phone ?
what ? !
you &apos;re --
no ! no ! what --
i was just making sure my facts were straight ...
cam .
... before i started a spirited conversation of current events .
yeah .
what else does it say ?
thank you .
sorry . is that the tuna tartare ?
yes , and it is delicious .
oh , i should &apos;ve ordered it .
would you like a taste ?
oh , no . but thank you . that &apos;s very sweet .
she really means it . uh , katie loves sharing food .
me , too . you know , i think
it &apos;s growing up in a big family ,
&apos;cause everything at suppertime on the table
was up for grabs .
we didn &apos;t say grace .
we said , &quot; on your marks , get set , go . &quot;
you sound exactly like my dad .
he was from this really big family in missouri , and --
shut up !
i &apos;m a missouri farm boy , myself !
stop !
oh , my gosh ! i &apos;m cam .
well , right pleased to meet you , cam .
this is brandon .
hi . she doesn &apos;t really talk like that .
oh , well , he slips in and out of his accent
like kate winslet in &quot; titanic . &quot;
uh , i &apos;m mitchell , by the way .
hi .
hi . - what -- what &apos;s yours , brandon ?
it looks delicious , too .
it &apos;s the truffle parmesan gnocchi .
do you know what , though ? if you want a bite of that ,
you &apos;re barking up the wrong tree .
&apos;cause that dish is in a strict no @-@ share zone .
i just --
i don &apos;t like people eating off my plate .
yeah , because you &apos;re not an animal . i &apos;m the same way .
oh , my gosh ! you &apos;re exactly us !
no , you guys are more interesting ,
&apos;cause you have the whole gay thing .
katie , you don &apos;t know if they &apos;re gay .
okay , that &apos;s adorable .
yeah , it was -- it was a pretty safe bet .
okay . i &apos;m running to the powder room .
cam , please try the tartare ,
because whatever you order , i want a taste .
okay . well , don &apos;t you dillydally ,
because i ain &apos;t exactly slow once i tie on the ol &apos; feed bag !
calm down , honey boo boo .
she &apos;s so cute !
very adorable .
so , brandon , what do you do for a living ? are you --
look , guys . i @-@ i hate to be blunt ,
but could you please give us some space ?
not a problem .
look , no -- no , it &apos;s --
i mean , you guys are great . but i &apos;m gonna ...
propose to katie tonight .
and i &apos;m kind of feeling -- yeah .
what ? ! here ? !
oh , my god ! that &apos;s amazing !
we just got engaged a few months ago .
great .
yeah , so we will definitely give you your privacy .
congratulations .
absolutely .
yeah . good luck .
you know what ? if you wanted ,
i could pretend like i &apos;m texting ,
and i could video the whole thing on my phone .
that way , you &apos;d have it forever .
really ? i mean , that -- yeah .
that would be awesome .
a @-@ are you sure ?
he gets very , uh , well , excited .
and he might give it away .
mitchell , um , i think i know katie well enough
to tell if she &apos;s getting suspicious .
cam ? !
she said i could .
the hell &apos;s the corkscrew ?
do you want to talk about it ?
there &apos;s nothing to talk about !
shorty does dumb things all the time .
you mark my words -- in three months ,
he &apos;ll be back here needing money .
maybe this is not about shorty coming back .
maybe this is about shorty not coming back .
manny .
what she &apos;s saying is , deep down ,
you &apos;re afraid shorty &apos;s going to love costa rica ,
and you &apos;ll lose your best friend forever .
that &apos;s what you do .
you push people away , so when they leave ,
it doesn &apos;t hurt that much .
i don &apos;t get it . you &apos;re the greatest generation ,
but why can &apos;t you feel ?
why can &apos;t you spend your teen years
locked in your bedroom like a normal kid ?
see ? now he &apos;s doing it to me .
uh , you have to face it , jay .
one day , i &apos;ll be moving out of this house .
can i get that in writing ?
&apos;cause i just can &apos;t shake this image of a 30 @-@ year @-@ old you
eating my food and cuddling with my wife .
boys should never stop cuddling their mothers .
i &apos;m gonna have nightmares !
you pretend to be so tough .
but you know what i think ?
i think that deep down ,
you &apos;re the most sensitive person in this house .
see ?
you did it again .
i say something that strikes a nerve ,
and immediately , you cannot handle it .
that &apos;s why you &quot; pbht &quot; in my face !
we just found the one thing you can &apos;t make sexy .
there it is again .
i need a drink .
jay , you have to make this right with shorty .
you have to tell him how you feel !
he has been a great compadre with you for many years .
besides , who else is going to laugh at your jokes ?
lots of people laugh at my jokes .
name one person that doesn &apos;t work for you .
hey , you know what ? why don &apos;t you two just go cuddle ?
okay , here she comes .
stay calm .
you &apos;re gonna spoil it .
you stay calm .
ooh , that looks good . what is it ?
um , uh , this is the grilled calamari .
it &apos;s scrumptious . would you care for a ring ?
i -- um , i mean , dig in there , girlfriend !
oh , no , that &apos;s okay . thank you .
this looks so delicious .
yeah , mine &apos;s delicious , too .
katie ...
you look so beautiful tonight .
you know , i @-@ i &apos;ve never met anyone like you ,
and i know that i never will . and i ...
i love you so much .
will you make me the happiest man on earth
and be my bride ?
what ? !
oh , my god !
no !
no ?
no !
sorry .
did you know that this place used to be a bank ?
was it , really ?
i just -- i don &apos;t want to be married , brandon .
we &apos;ll end up like one of those couples
that just sits there with nothing to talk about
until we glom on to other people .
i can &apos;t believe this . you -- you don &apos;t love me ?
no !
no ?
i &apos;m sor ...
no !
i need some air .
so , syria , any updates ?
no , nothing yet .
nothing .
do you remember how cute she was when she was little
and she couldn &apos;t say her p &apos;s ?
&quot; bake a @-@ tatoes . &quot;
&quot; bake a @-@ tatoes &quot; and &quot; attlesauce . &quot;
&quot; attlesauce &quot; !
&quot; can i have attlesauce ? &quot;
first of all , you &apos;re screaming .
can we just get the check , please ?
could you please not be mad at us anymore ?
we are very sorry that you felt manipulated .
you know what i &apos;m pretty sure is ironic ?
you guys spend all this time worrying
about what i &apos;m going to do ,
and maybe you should start thinking
about what you &apos;re going to do .
what are you talking about ?
well , what are you gonna do when we &apos;re gone ?
what &apos;s your plan ?
uh , to be fine .
yeah .
&apos;cause we &apos;re fine .
totally .
you guys are gone .
we get an r.v. bam !
me , mama ...
and our dog , merlin , hit the open road .
no . i am not spending my golden years
driving around an r.v. park ,
looking for a place to plug my house in .
no . i am gonna go see the world .
where do you wanna go ?
i don &apos;t know , phil . india . africa .
diarrhea . diarrhea .
wow . it sounds like you guys really need to start thinking
about your future .
are you just gonna put merlin in a kennel when we &apos;re gone ?
okay , phil , merlin doesn &apos;t exist .
and why do you want to get a dog to take care of
so soon after the kids leave ?
well , i &apos;m gonna need someone to love me , claire .
and in the meantime , mom ,
grandpa wants you to take over the business , but ...
do you want that ?
i @-@ i guess i hadn &apos;t thought this far into the future .
and , dad , are you just gonna keep selling houses ?
i mean , i don &apos;t want to blow your mind here ,
but you could still be a magician .
i could .
he couldn &apos;t .
really ?
this salt shaker behind your head says different .
oh , phil , you &apos;re getting salt all over me .
i feel like a margarita .
you got it !
no , no , no , no , no , no !
just the check , please .
okay .
thank you so much .
thanks , buddy .
yeah .
oh , no . i left my wallet in the other coat .
i did not bring my purse .
it &apos;s fine , guys . i got this .
honey , thank you .
oh , thank you , sweetie .
i should probably drive , too , huh ?
probably .
i gue-- yeah .
yeah .
why don &apos;t you guys have the valet pull the car up
while i pay the check ?
that we can do .
uh , you guys , it &apos;s that way .
mm @-@ hmm .
it is .
y @-@ you know , for the record , we do have a lot to talk about .
yeah , we just took a couple of topics off the table
because we wanted to have a romantic date night .
and it probably put too much pressure on it to be special ,
but the truth is , every day i spend with this man is special .
oh , cam !
oh , no , i &apos;m the lucky one .
there we are .
i &apos;m sorry .
i guess i just panicked when brandon asked me .
i mean , we &apos;re so different . and i know it seems petty ,
but it speaks to something bigger .
i don &apos;t know if i can spend the rest of my life
with the kind of guy who won &apos;t let me eat off his plate .
trust me -- it can be done .
and i should not make such a big deal about that .
i promise i &apos;ll try and do better .
no , you &apos;re right . you don &apos;t like it ,
and i should respect that more .
are you guys married ?
oh , this may .
but , basically , we &apos;ve been married for years .
yeah .
i @-@ i mean , is cam everything that i dreamed of ?
tread lightly , counselor .
yes . yes , he is .
because through all the compromises
and negotiations and arguments
and sometimes even boredom ,
i cannot picture my life without him .
that &apos;s very sweet .
i would &apos;ve scooted past the boredom , but ...
at the end of the day , katie , you have to ask yourself ,
can you imagine your life without this person ?
hey . all right , look .
i , uh , paid the check , okay ? let &apos;s just go .
brandon , can you just please sit ?
i &apos;ve been talking to the guys here ,
and they really opened my eyes .
they did ?
yes .
i &apos;ve been trying to picture my life without you , and ...
you know what ?
i can .
we didn &apos;t tell her that .
i didn &apos;t say that .
no , i want what you guys have , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry , brandon .
i am so sorry , but we both deserve that .
i &apos;ve never been so sure of anything .
you know what ? i &apos;m just ...
gonna go get a cab , okay ?
goodbye .
and thank you .
don &apos;t-- don &apos;t thank us !
we didn &apos;t do anything ,
so ... we didn &apos;t , honestly .
this is the worst night of my life .
i &apos;m sorry .
but , i mean , um , a @-@ at least now it &apos;s over .
you can ... start to move on .
i &apos;ve been trying to picture my life without you .
and you know what ?
s @-@ stupid phone .
i can .
it &apos;s a ... devil phone .
when mitchell was born , he was a month premature .
so it was touch and go there for a while .
it &apos;s 2 a.m.
i walk out into the hospital waiting room to get some air ,
and there &apos;s shorty .
he &apos;d been sitting there for six hours
and refused to leave for the next two days .
that &apos;s where we got mitchell &apos;s middle name .
not shorty --
vincent .
&quot; m.v.p. &quot;
we were a little premature on that one , too .
gloria , i &apos;m going for a drive !
say hi to shorty for me !
i &apos;m not talking to you !
i was just coming to see you .
um , i left my jacket .
oh ! there it is ! come on in .
uh , shorty , you know that stuff i said , uh --
yeah , i get it .
we &apos;re good , huh ?
under the bridge .
all right . i &apos;ll see you .
shorty , wait .
i need to say something to you .
yeah .
i want to thank you ...
for all the great times we &apos;ve had .
yeah . we , um ...
we had a lot of laughs .
yeah .
and you should know that , uh ...
you &apos;re my best friend .
you know ?
probably the best friend i &apos;m ever gonna have .
jay , i mean ... what are you doing to me ?
this is hard for me . i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m just trying to tell you how i feel .
well , i &apos;m gonna tell you how i feel .
i admire the hell out of you , jay .
i always tell darlene , &quot; that &apos;s a real guy . &quot;
self @-@ made , stand @-@ up ,
the kind of guy you want to be in a foxhole with .
well , i &apos;m not all that .
well , it &apos;s not like i &apos;ve been in a foxhole .
i &apos;m gonna miss you , vincent .
i &apos;m gonna miss you , too .
i love you .
i love you , too , jay bird .
i really , really do .
you call me , okay ?
every day .
every damn day .
if i &apos;m being honest ,
this is a little girlier than i thought .
two years .
how could she just walk away ?
you know what ? she did you a favor .
absolutely .
you can do so much better .
oh , my god . insanely better .
no , he &apos;s not kidding . brandon , you are seriously gorge !
if you ask me , she got the better end of the deal .
you really think so ?
yes ! yes !
yes !
and her whole fake blond thing ? i don &apos;t know .
it was kind of trampy .
and truth be told ,
she didn &apos;t seem that bright .
and is she older than you ?
because she looked significantly older than you .
trust us .
this is the best thing that &apos;s ever happened to you .
best thing that &apos;s ever happened to you .
oh ! thank god you &apos;re still here !
i was on my way home , and all of a sudden , i started crying .
and i realized i was just scared .
and i love you . and i &apos;m so , so sorry .
and , yes , brandon , if you &apos;ll still have me ,
yes , i will marry you !
