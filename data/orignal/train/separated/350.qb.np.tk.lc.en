the bureau thinks that my ability to lead this team
has been compromised .
i &apos;m resigning as unit chief at the end of the week .
what ? !
i &apos;m not leaving the team .
i &apos;m just no longer in charge .
you are .
me ?
ms. barnes , i &apos;m sorry for your brother &apos;s death .
i know that sounds like something people say ,
but i truly am sorry .
thank you for helping me through this .
of course .
i think you need to cut contact with tamara barnes .
penelope , she lost her brother . she just wants answers .
i &apos;m not involved .
let &apos;s go .
we have to hurry .
we are .
it &apos;s 10 minutes before curfew .
i &apos;ll get you there .
what just happened with ben ?
it was just a peck .
only because you weren &apos;t alone , but next time--
so are you going to text him tonight ?
maybe .
well , you should .
i don &apos;t know . i have homework to do still .
so what ?
i guess he is pretty cute .
um , yeah .
no ! no ! please !
stop ! stop !
i don &apos;t know , it sounds like a promotion to me .
well , yeah , it--
it &apos;s complicated .
what isn &apos;t ?
yeah .
it &apos;s just everything &apos;s happened so fast ,
i mean , we haven &apos;t even had a chance
to tell the rest of our team yet .
you know , i wanted to thank you again for ...
coming to the hearing .
i didn &apos;t know if it was fair to ask you .
tamara , i &apos;m glad i could be there for you .
i think that the only time that i have felt sane at all
in the past few weeks is when i &apos;ve talked to you .
really ?
i feel like i &apos;m the one who &apos;s been doing all the talking here .
you &apos;ve helped me reconnect to my job .
to myself , really .
it &apos;s good to see you again .
it &apos;s really nice to see you , too .
so , listen ,
i know that your new job is a lot of responsibility
and you &apos;re gonna have to commit a hundred percent , and you should .
but maybe when things calm down ,
i &apos;ll buy you a drink ? fair ?
yeah . it &apos;s more than fair .
also , i wanted to give you something .
it was william &apos;s .
i can &apos;t take this .
i want you to have it . please .
for being there for me .
when you lose a brother the way that i did ,
it &apos;s nice to have someone like you at my side .
so , did anyone explain why hotch is stepping down ?
all morgan said this morning is that it &apos;s happening .
and it &apos;s business as usual .
so we &apos;re just supposed to move forward without any discussion ?
after foyet , i think we &apos;d have to be ready for anything .
did you pick a case ?
agent jareau and i reviewed the requests this morning ,
and i &apos;ve decided on oklahoma city .
why this one ?
locals have more evidentiary information in other priorities .
this one , they have nothing .
they need us the most .
good .
if that &apos;s all , i &apos;d like to gather the team .
i &apos;ll be checking in . i expect to be briefed .
yes , ma &apos;am .
if you need privacy , please use my office .
that &apos;s ok. we &apos;re done here .
and when we get back , i &apos;ll clear everything out
and it &apos;ll be all yours .
hotch , i don &apos;t want your office .
i agree with agent hotchner .
the team leader needs a proper office .
all due respect , ms. strauss ,
but both of you have trusted me
to step in as acting unit chief .
i &apos;m asking that you respect my decision .
i &apos;ve decided that i don &apos;t want hotch &apos;s office .
that &apos;s where he belongs .
if necessary , we can discuss this again at a later date ,
but right now , we really need to get started on this case .
guys .
grab rossi .
this is megan chertow and her friend bina sukarto ,
both 17 , found 2 nights ago in a parking garage ,
carotids severed .
this is john o &apos;heron , 61 .
he was found dead in a wooded area 4 days ago ,
blunt force trauma to the head .
different m.o.
and completely different victimology .
how are the cases linked ?
their eyes have been removed .
oh , he &apos;s an enucleator .
there &apos;s a name for this ?
it &apos;s a rare subset of criminal behavior ,
but there have been case studies of assaultive enucleators .
the overwhelming majority of them suffer from diagnosed mental disorders .
and they &apos;re usually males ,
lack social skills ,
their kills are disorganized and sloppy .
the typical enucleator gouges the eyes out ,
but he doesn &apos;t normally take them with him .
this guy did ?
we need to figure out why .
there are noticeable shifts from the first to second murder .
he goes from killing in seclusion to a public place .
and he escalated from one victim to 2 .
what concerns me most is there &apos;s less than 48 hours between the murders .
that &apos;s why i chose this case .
and from what we know about enucleators ,
they &apos;re almost always multiple repeat offenders .
exactly . which means he &apos;s going to need to kill again soon .
all right. let &apos;s meet on the plane in 30 .
&quot; and if thy right eye offend thee ,
pluck it out and cast it from thee . &quot;
matthew 5 : 29 .
the color of all the victims &apos; eyes are different ,
so that probably doesn &apos;t factor in to victimology .
it &apos;s more likely what he sees in the eyes .
case studies show that most enucleators suffer from delusions .
they hear voices and see things in people &apos;s eyes .
usually something evil .
they &apos;re driven to enucleate to destroy the devil .
it points to someone who may have been institutionalized
and recently released .
i &apos;ll have garcia start looking .
all right , so talk to me .
what makes these attacks so different ?
with victim one , there were multiple blunt force strikes to the head--
a more personal kill .
and he disposed of the body ,
maybe as a forensic countermeasure .
the next murders seemed less personal ,
more opportunistic .
i think we need to look at why the first victim
was bludgeoned and dumped .
perhaps the unsub knew him .
prentiss , i want you to go to the disposal site ,
see if you can figure out why he was dumped there .
rossi , you and i are gonna go to last night &apos;s crime scene .
actually , uh , the girls &apos; families asked to speak to our team leader .
all right. um ...
ok , in that case , rossi , you can handle the crime scene solo .
jj , you &apos;re with me , and , hotch , reid ,
i want you to get into john o &apos;heron &apos;s life ,
see if anything at all points to a personal motive .
oklahoma city , p.d. oklahoma
hey . phil brantley. appreciate you all coming .
agent hotchner. this is dr. reid .
you &apos;ll meet the rest of the team later .
here &apos;s one. excellent .
ok , here &apos;s where the first body was found ,
just outside of town .
and last night &apos;s murders were here .
and that &apos;s about 22 miles apart .
that &apos;s unusual .
what ?
serial killers usually have a smaller kill zone .
it &apos;s our technical analyst .
hey , garcia , you &apos;re on speaker phone .
so , i looked up recently released mental health patients
who have a history of eye gouging ,
eye assault , and other gross things you can do to eyes and sockets .
and there &apos;s no bingo for okie city residents .
any other recent attacks involving assaults on eyes ?
there &apos;s one 9 months ago. he &apos;s not your guy &apos; cause he &apos;s in jail .
we &apos;ll call you later .
10 @-@ 4 , breaker breaker . bye .
you think he &apos;s fresh out of an asylum ?
either that or he &apos;s been held somewhere and he &apos;s now free .
we &apos;ve seen eye assaults before ,
you know , bar brawls , rage , domestic abuse cases .
but nothing like this .
what the hell &apos;s he doing with the eyes ?
he could be collecting them as a trophy of some sort .
they wouldn &apos;t keep long as trophies .
eyes are 80 % vitreous humor ,
which is essentially water .
after a few hours , they begin to get cloudy and wilt .
any other theories ?
there have been cases where after enucleation ,
mental patients have consumed the eyeballs .
are you serious ?
thank you for coming here .
it &apos;s no problem .
we can &apos;t leave our house . we have to mourn for 3 days .
buddhist rituals ?
yes .
did your sister call you while she was out last night ?
no . i knew something was wrong .
she always comes home by curfew .
does this man look familiar to you ?
no .
why do you ask ?
we believe he and your sister were killed by the same person .
it helps us to rule out any connection between the victims ,
and it tells us that your sister was most likely attacked at random .
oh , thank you .
thank you .
i asked to speak to you
because we need you to do something for us .
it &apos;s ok .
take your time .
grandma said she saw bina &apos;s ghost last night .
her eyes were just big black holes .
bina was looking for her eyes .
she says bina &apos;s cursed .
she can &apos;t rest .
she &apos;s stuck for eternity
looking for her eyes .
we want to cremate her .
but we need all of her .
can you find her eyes for us ?
we will try .
but realistically , we may not be able to .
then she will be cursed forever .
she may never rest in peace .
o &apos;heron &apos;s friends say he has a history of drunken behavior ,
but they don &apos;t know anybody with a grudge against him .
he was last seen leaving a bar .
bartender on duty said he left without incident .
where did he go after that ?
i checked out the disposal site where john o &apos;heron &apos;s body was dumped .
it &apos;s a remote farm road .
the unsub didn &apos;t just stumble on it , he knows it .
we need a list of people who work or live near the area .
i got a bad feeling about this guy .
why is that ?
he chose that parking garage .
he was patient .
he hidden and waited for the right victims
and the right time and place .
he blitzed them .
it was all strategic .
that sounds way too organized for a typical enucleator .
add to that his lack of a cooling @-@ off period between kills ,
it &apos;s not gonna be easy to get ahead of him .
i just got off the phone with the m.e.
she says there &apos;s something we should see .
the eyeball is held in the socket
by 6 different muscles , fatty tissue ,
and the optic nerves .
these are pictures of john o &apos;heron &apos;s eye sockets .
see the optic nerves protruding ?
trauma . they were ripped out .
maybe with fingers .
now compare this to my body on the table .
smooth inside , no bruising ,
no sign of trauma .
optic nerves retracted into the muscle
and they have a clean edge .
so you &apos;re saying these were cut out .
with a sharp @-@ edged tool .
he managed to avoid cutting the sockets or the eyelids .
this was precise work .
the kind of work only a doctor could do ?
all i &apos;m saying is that with both of these girls ,
it was a clean excision .
ok , so he was crude with the first victim ,
surgical with the others .
the amount of effort he &apos;s going through
to remove the eyes now , he wouldn &apos;t destroy them .
he &apos;s keeping them .
excluded by the chosen part of spot agian
he &apos;s not afraid to get caught .
this is far from the other crime scenes .
what brought him here ?
well , he only killed one person this time .
it could have been more .
hey , we found a car parked nearby .
i.d. &apos; d her from a dmv photo .
tracy copper , 32 . husband said she was an avid jogger .
single knife wound to the neck , eyes are missing .
cut out as carefully as the last ones .
hey , garcia . so we have the list of local doctors ,
but we need to back it up one step .
where shall i splice , my pretties ?
give me a list of all doctors
who &apos;ve had infractions like malpractice suits .
got it . bouncing your way .
narrow it down to eye specialists .
whoo , that &apos;s still a lot of names .
we &apos;ll chip away when we know more .
hey , wait . before you hang up ,
how &apos;s my morgan doing ?
fine .
i know the man is fine .
how &apos;s he holding up as head honcho ?
well , he &apos;s stressed , but he &apos;s on top of it .
speaking of which ,
there is something you could do for him .
name it .
he must have hidden in these trees lying in wait again .
so he picked his location and then waited for a victim of opportunity .
he blitzes her because he lacks the social skills to charm .
that feels like the same pattern as the girls in the parking lot .
but he was quiet in the parking lot .
if he hid in these trees ,
there &apos;s too much dry brush .
he would have made noise .
no , it &apos;s too sloppy for him .
she was a serious jogger .
if she &apos;d heard him ,
she might have been able to outrun him .
unless he surprised her some other way .
guys .
what is that ?
a tripwire .
we need to look at her ankles .
he used the tripwire to get her off her feet .
she &apos;s stunned and she doesn &apos;t have time to run away .
he laid a trap for her .
all this , plus the way he bleeds her at the neck .
it &apos;s the behavior of a game hunter .
hunting &apos;s a big part of this city &apos;s culture .
yeah , hunting animals is .
what triggered him to start hunting humans ?
this guy is taking people &apos;s eyes ,
so he &apos;s definitely disturbed .
what bugs me is that people like this
usually unravel , get sloppy .
and this guy &apos;s only getting better .
they &apos;re back .
morgan , i &apos;m fielding calls left and right here .
what &apos;s happening ?
case made national news .
they &apos;re starting to call him the eye snatcher .
all right , um ,
you &apos;re gonna hold a small , controlled press conference .
answer their questions , but try to squash that name .
i want the people to be aware , but i do not want to make
a bogeyman out of this guy . you understand ?
yeah . yeah .
is there something else ?
you &apos;re not answering strauss &apos; calls .
she &apos;s just trying to keep tabs . she can wait .
morgan . maybe you should take the time to field the call .
hotch , we have to set up a tip line .
we have to go over jj &apos;s talking points .
we haven &apos;t gotten the profile out yet .
all of that takes priority over dealing with strauss .
i understand all that .
let us help you set up strategy while you talk to her .
we &apos;ll regroup with you before we proceed .
we have enough battles . believe me ,
you don &apos;t want to fight her , too .
let me get this profile out ,
and then i &apos;ll go talk to strauss .
he &apos;s doing a good job .
he is .
have you thought about how this is going to end ?
what do you mean ?
morgan as our unit chief is a temporary thing .
it is .
he &apos;s a natural leader. he &apos;ll excel .
what happens when he &apos;s asked to step down ?
we believe that our unsub may have known his first victim ,
yet the rest were random .
most enucleators have a mental disorder
and are frenzied and sloppy when they attack .
this one has more control .
we are not calling him by any nickname .
he is simply a murderer that the fbi is trying to apprehend .
he lays in wait to kill his victims ,
knows how to cut them so they bleed out .
this indicates he might have a hunting background .
we &apos;re urging citizens to be hypervigilant at night .
he is killing in different areas of the city in public places .
his large kill zone could be related
to some type of travel pattern in his life ,
which indicates a comfort with these neighborhoods .
why , all of a sudden , is he killing people every day ?
the escalation might be caused by a self @-@ imposed time line .
he has to murder so many people ,
take this many eyes , to accomplish a task .
so he &apos;s crazy , but he &apos;s got a mission ?
actually , yes .
he &apos;s acting on a delusion
that &apos;s fueling this murder spree .
for example ,
a man named herbert mullin .
he had a fear of a catastrophic earthquake hitting california .
now , he believed that by killing people
and offering their blood as a sacrifice to the earth ,
he could prevent an earthquake .
he was a paranoid schizophrenic ,
and his delusion led him to kill 13 people .
uh , what should we look for when we &apos;re on the streets ?
we believe he &apos;s a white male , 27 to 35 .
we believe he is driving a van or a pickup truck with a removable cab .
something utilitarian that can get bloody and wash out easily .
he may also have applied for hunting licenses .
he has some sort of medical or surgical training
but fell short of making a career out of it .
he may have been in a halfway house
or have been granted leave from a treatment facility .
maybe his family moved him away and now he &apos;s back .
if you know anyone who fits these types of scenarios ,
please call our tip line .
our unsub kills at night ,
employs hunting tactics , and is patient .
he will wait until he can be alone with his victims .
chief strauss .
you &apos;re answering my calls now ?
listen , i apologize for this morning ,
but i &apos;m sure you can understand how busy we were .
so what &apos;s the strategy tonight ?
i have the team visiting precincts all over town
helping locals set up patrol .
and media outlets are warning citizens to be hypervigilant .
what about suspects ?
nothing viable yet .
so ultimately , you &apos;re no closer to catching him tonight .
trust me ,
i am well aware that he is probably out there hunting as we speak .
now , if i wake up in the morning and there are more victims ,
that is all on me .
look , i &apos;m not criticizing you .
in fact , there are a lot of people who have faith in you
and want to see you succeed . do you understand that ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m just checking in to make sure your team is intact
and that you have everything you need to do your job .
this team is solid ,
and we will get the job done .
we &apos;ll touch base tomorrow .
i &apos;m dreading going to work .
you always say that .
hey , i &apos;ll start looking for a new job .
we &apos;ll grab a paper in the morning
and start circling whatever looks good to you .
did you hear something ?
that &apos;s weird .
i see someone .
hello !
hello ?
wes ?
what the hell &apos;s he doing ?
i &apos;m freaking out .
there &apos;s no reception .
let &apos;s go .
no , sandy . not that way .
wes , can you see ?
quiet , baby . he can hear us .
he &apos;s behind us .
get in front of me .
i can &apos;t see anything .
get to the car . down the hill .
go . go , go .
go , sandy . go .
wes .
wes ?
wes .
no , please don &apos;t .
thought i &apos;d beat everyone here .
no .
you here all night ?
you know you can &apos;t do that again , right ?
rossi , when you walked in here ,
i really thought you were gonna tell me that there was another victim .
we &apos;re having no luck at all trying to find this guy on paper .
that &apos;s why we step away ,
get some sleep , come back fresh .
we &apos;re looking for a doctor who is also a hunter
and a former mental patient who happens to be cutting people &apos;s eyes out .
trust the profile .
when we get him , it &apos;ll all make sense .
good morning .
no , it isn &apos;t .
don &apos;t tell me .
a male and a female .
he &apos;s back to killing 2 ?
there &apos;s something different about this crime scene , though .
he cut the wires in the electrical boxes ,
killed all the lights .
so they couldn &apos;t see .
he wanted to force them off the trail
so he could hunt them in the dark .
if they couldn &apos;t see , he couldn &apos;t .
he probably used some kind of night vision aid ,
like a scope , something a hunter would use .
her carotid was severed ,
and her eyes are missing , just like the others .
he didn &apos;t take the boy &apos;s eyes .
well , why not ? what &apos;s so different ?
there &apos;s a laceration on his left eye ,
the right eye he didn &apos;t even touch .
he &apos;s got defensive wounds on his arms .
he probably tried to fight back to protect the girl .
during the fight , the unsub could have cut his eye .
we said he might be collecting them .
what if he needs a set ? an injury like that ruins the collection .
they &apos;re trophies . oh , my god .
what ?
i know this sounds crazy , but just hear me out .
a taxidermist ?
morgan might be onto something .
the unsub &apos;s collecting sets of eyes
that need to be flawless .
because he &apos;s preserving them as a trophy of some kind .
we said he was a hunter .
what do hunters collect for trophies ?
what if we &apos;re wrong about him being a doctor ?
it makes sense .
a taxidermist has all the skills and supplies
needed to preserve eyes and other body parts .
do they know how to surgically remove eyes like this ?
yeah , they have anatomy knowledge .
they have to cut through muscle , tissue , and nerves
in order to remove hide .
it &apos;s the exact same thing for eyeballs .
garcia , you &apos;re on speaker .
comrades , i cross @-@ referenced
this john o &apos;heron with okie city animal stuffers .
turns out he wrote a $ 250 check as some sort of deposit
for lloyd &apos;s wild game shop 6 weeks ago .
now , this place is scant miles from the farm road
where our first victim was dumped .
does lloyd have a record ?
uh ... lloyd bulford
has one recent record from the city , and it is ...
a death certificate .
he died 4 weeks ago .
of what ?
emphysema .
any employees with criminal records ?
he &apos;s got no employment records at all .
he has a 28 @-@ year @-@ old son named earl who lives with him
who has a petty crime record
and 3 counts of animal cruelty .
garcia , get everything on the son .
okey @-@ dokey .
morgan , we may have someone .
i &apos;m calling from oklahoma city bank and trust .
this is our fifth attempt to reach
mr. earl bulford .
we just want to remind you
that you need to collect all your belongings
and vacate the premises by sunday .
the eyes aren &apos;t right .
where &apos;s your dad ?
he &apos;s gotta fix those eyes .
the eyes are good .
you can &apos;t do eyes !
here ! i &apos;m taking it somewhere else .
you can &apos;t do eyes .
is there any record of mental illness ?
no , but mom had a degenerative eye disease
called retinitis pigmentosa ,
which would eventually lead her to go blind ,
and considering his crimes , that &apos;s super weird , right ?
so , anyway , she died in a car accident when he was 8,
and then he gets expelled from school
for getting in a fight with a kid
and trying to gouge the kid &apos;s eyes out .
i have no record of him returning to school ,
he has no employment records ,
he &apos;s never filed for taxes ,
he doesn &apos;t have a credit card in his name .
besides his driver &apos;s license , there &apos;s no record on him at all .
that &apos;s probably why he didn &apos;t show up on any of our lists .
sounds like he &apos;s totally dependent on his dad ,
and when dad dies , there &apos;s no one left to check up on him .
ok , dad drove a 1990 dark @-@ brown chevy cargo van .
hot news-- creditors took the house this week ,
and a lien was put on the business .
lost his dad , his house , about to lose the family business .
care to choose a stressor ?
i &apos;ll take the back with brantley .
there &apos;s no van here .
copy .
i don &apos;t see anything .
hotch , i see blood . we &apos;re going in .
clear .
that &apos;s gotta be john o &apos;heron &apos;s blood .
so he comes here to see his animal ,
they argue , and then this happens .
clear .
he &apos;s been sleeping here .
well , if he &apos;s not here now , then he &apos;s out hunting again .
this one doesn &apos;t have eyes .
neither does this one .
this one does .
this is what &apos;s he &apos;s doing with the eyes .
look at these . he &apos;s been hunting since he was a kid .
never went to school .
probably spent his entire childhood in here .
somebody this socially isolated no doubt has mental issues .
looks like he only knew two things ...
hunting and taxidermy .
which was fine as long as daddy was supervising him .
now his gatekeeper &apos;s gone and he &apos;s loose .
right over there , please .
yes , madam .
this is much later than you guys said it was gonna be .
let me see it .
my daddy &apos;s gonna love it .
what ?
i need something from you .
i think this is all of his customer information .
morgan , prentiss .
wait a minute . this address , junction road ,
it &apos;s close to where the teenage girls got killed .
i think he &apos;s attacking all over town
close to where his customers live .
i know the customer on dry creek road ,
close to where that jogger got killed in the park .
and what about where the couple was murdered last night ?
close to this address here .
ok , so he &apos;s delivering these animals to his clients &apos; homes
and then sticking around the neighborhood to find victims .
and there are 2 more addresses here .
all right , we should split up and go .
i &apos;ll get units to these locations .
all right , thank you so much .
the woman at the bleaker address hasn &apos;t seen him today .
no response at the other residence .
what the hell ?
may i help you ?
i &apos;m agent hotchner with the fbi .
this is lieutenant brantley . may we come in ?
yeah .
did you get a delivery today
from a taxidermy shop from this man ?
yes , i did .
i need an apb in my area .
how long ago was this ?
about an hour ago .
he said he needed something from me .
the balance i owed . i paid him and he left .
he creeped the hell out of me .
these are glass .
what is this about ?
agent hotchner . they found the van . it &apos;s close .
excuse us .
he must be close by .
you take the street to the north .
help !
i need backup near motor and descanso .
fbi , earl ! get off of her !
we got him . we got him !
call an ambulance !
we need medical assistance .
8800 block of descanso , south side of the street .
secure him .
can you hear me ?
help is on the way . hold still .
hold still .
what happened here ?
hotch .
brantley says you took him down solo .
he wasn &apos;t far behind me .
you know you should have waited for backup .
would you have ?
what ?
nothing .
we got him . we &apos;re coming home .
you guys rock .
right back at you .
so how are you doing on that special ops mission ?
mission accomplished .
i had no doubt . bye .
keep it .
there he is .
the team &apos;s at the hotel packing .
you think we can leave in about an hour ?
yeah . yeah , we can try .
hey , that &apos;s my stuff . hey !
where did you get that stuff ?
keep your voice down .
that guy was mean .
he deserved it .
you know , you &apos;ve got ...
real pretty eyes .
get him out of here--now .
sorry .
jj , did they find any more human eyes at the shop ?
yeah , a few . they &apos;re still looking .
they &apos;re hoping to match the eyes
to the rest of the victims .
uh , listen , i may need more than an hour .
ms. sukarto .
agent morgan .
did you find them ?
we did .
they &apos;re at the coroner &apos;s office right now .
they need to be processed for evidence first ,
but they can be sent to the funeral home of your choice tomorrow .
you have no idea what this means to us .
i really hope your sister can rest in peace now .
good night .
&quot; dwell in peace in the home of your own being ,
and the messenger of death will not be able to touch you . &quot;
guru nanak .
you are here late .
reports .
hotch always stayed later than the rest of us ,
and now i understand why .
he doesn &apos;t have to write them anymore . why is he still here ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i do know i need to get some rest .
i got another case starting tomorrow .
um , i--before you go ,
can you help me get something out of storage ?
yes , baby girl . anything for you .
thank you .
hey , what &apos;s that ? i haven &apos;t seen it before .
penelope , there &apos;s a lot of my stuff that you haven &apos;t seen before .
wow , you are a tease .
voila .
what are we doing in hall &apos;s office ?
um , it &apos;s kind of not hall &apos;s office anymore .
it &apos;s your office .
what ?
jj made some calls .
agent hall &apos;s retiring in a month ,
but he &apos;s finishing his caseload at home ,
so , while you all were away ,
mama set to work clearing out the rest of his boxes
and setting up an uber office fit for our acting unit chief .
garcia , this is for real ?
it &apos;s kind of blah for my taste ,
but i figured you needed to keep up with agency standards .
i did make you your own ...
secret fun zone .
woman , you have lost your mind .
but you are the best .
i completely agree .
come here .
i will leave you alone to mark your territory .
thank you .
very much .
you are ever so welcome .
hey . it &apos;s me .
yeah , i &apos;m back .
