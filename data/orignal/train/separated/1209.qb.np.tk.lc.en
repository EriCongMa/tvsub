it &apos;s from &quot; a. &quot;
&quot; did you miss me , bitches ? &quot;
you need to give me those names , paige .
eddie wants ezra to know
that there &apos;s something to look into at radley .
oh , my god , i think that &apos;s supposed to be mrs. dilaurentis .
mrs. d was on the board at radley sanitarium .
bethany was a patient there .
bethany was buried in her yard
you think that &quot; a &quot; killed bethany and mrs. d ?
is there something going on between you two ?
that would be a connection .
a slip .
caleb , i had no idea when you &apos;d come back ,
or if you &apos;d ever come back .
i won &apos;t be staying long .
your hair . your clothes .
you know , a lot &apos;s changed with you since she &apos;s been back .
oh , yeah . and nothing &apos;s changed with you ?
lucas and melissa are working with mona .
and they &apos;re all after alison .
they remember how alison treated them .
they don &apos;t want things to go back to the way they were .
then maybe we can really get rid of her .
mr. ibarra is the only teacher of yours
who wouldn &apos;t schedule a video conference with me
while i was in texas with your dad .
is he new ?
yes , and he &apos;s very low @-@ tech .
he won &apos;t even use an electric pencil sharpener .
bye , mom .
uh , emily , wait a second .
i just had a thought .
ask alison to come by for dinner .
when ?
tonight .
tonight ?
yeah . spur of the moment .
and you know what ? ask the other girls to come , too .
she was just at the house .
well , i know , but we didn &apos;t really get a chance to talk .
and with everything alison &apos;s been through ,
i just want her to know that if she needs an ear that &apos;s attached to an adult ,
i &apos;m here for her .
okay .
all of us ?
what does your mom want with all of us ?
well , i think she &apos;s mostly asking ali .
that &apos;s not like your mom .
she &apos;s a planner .
okay , i &apos;m pretty sure emily &apos;s mom
is not one of mona &apos;s secret ninjas .
are we supposed to be suspicious of everyone now ?
it saves time .
well , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna be finished at radley .
i can &apos;t just put that bethany drawing
up on the bulletin board with my phone number .
it &apos;s gonna take a while .
&quot; a &quot; is not gonna give us a while .
hey , are you going to ezra &apos;s later to help him
move his research and spy stuff ?
sure .
look , em , i will try to make it , but ...
can you put your mom off ?
no , not without an epic excuse .
okay .
then we &apos;ll just do it , get it over with .
your wish is our command .
what is that supposed to mean ?
i have to go to class .
um , do you think you can walk me home after school ?
everything that happened with &quot; a &quot; at my house
was just really intense .
sure .
how &apos;s your arm ?
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll be fine .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll be fine .
do you think the teachers will see my bruises ?
and what if they ask questions ?
i mean , that &apos;s the kind of thing
that they have to report , don &apos;t they ?
ali , breathe .
the concealer covers most of it anyway .
hey , emily .
hi , sydney .
you must be alison . i &apos;m sydney .
that &apos;s a beautiful scarf .
第五季 第七集
a rat ?
yesterday , after practice .
i heard her screaming .
somebody put a dead rat in her cap .
you didn &apos;t hear about this ?
no .
she was shaking all over .
i guess she has a thing with rodents .
who did it ?
no one &apos;s fessed up .
coach wants a team meeting , but i don &apos;t think
it was someone on the sharks .
everyone loves paige .
likes her , i mean .
well , i haven &apos;t seen her yet .
i don &apos;t think she came to school .
you okay , emily ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
what do you know about this ?
you &apos;re gonna have to give me a hint .
what happened to paige ?
oh , the rat .
ah , god , it makes me irked just to think about it .
hey , sydney .
hey .
such a creepy thing to do to someone as sweet as paige .
how is she ?
she stayed home today . scared .
a dead rat has &quot; boy &quot; written all over it .
any particular boy ?
none comes to mind .
not even noel kahn ?
he lent me his notes as a favor .
later .
caleb ?
what are you doing here ?
exit exams .
well , how &apos;s reading about monsters gonna help you ?
shouldn &apos;t you be studying ?
i &apos;ll wing it .
you can &apos;t wing it .
it &apos;s like all of high school in one test .
look , i &apos;m good . okay ?
if they ask who signed the emancipation proclamation ,
i &apos;ll say daniel day lewis .
what ?
i believed it .
sorry .
i should &apos;ve asked .
you never did .
so what &apos;s going on ?
what do you mean ?
you only eat three at a time
when you &apos;re bugging out about something .
is it about alison ?
okay , emily &apos;s mom is making dinner for her tonight .
and we all have to be there
in case mrs. fields decides to grill her , too .
why do you all have to be there ?
how much immoral support does alison need ?
caleb .
if you &apos;re gonna make a break , just do it .
it &apos;s not that easy .
i didn &apos;t say it wouldn &apos;t be messy .
caleb , i &apos;ve been through a divorce . okay ?
it &apos;s not just about cutting off alison .
i don &apos;t want to get into some weird custody battle
over our friends .
well , if you lose them , you &apos;ve always got me .
i should probably get in there .
i could use the next 10 minutes to figure out
why there are three branches of government .
good luck .
hey there .
you the new volunteer ?
aria ?
i mangled it , didn &apos;t i ?
what ?
your name on the badge .
oh , no . no , you got it right .
did you volunteer for the reading program last year ?
nope . no , this is my first time here .
feel like we &apos;ve met before .
i don &apos;t think so .
it &apos;s good to see you again ,
now that the smoke has cleared .
yeah , my ears are still ringing .
well , i &apos;m glad i &apos;m not the only one
that has to take these tests .
i &apos;m taking them to get out ,
you &apos;re taking them to get in .
either way , it all comes down to the same thing .
pass @-@ fail , win @-@ lose .
is that what you learned those two years
someone had you in a box ?
i got out of the box , didn &apos;t i ?
with a little help from your friends .
everybody needs someone to depend on .
you seem to need a lot of support .
i &apos;m not sure i know what you mean .
i &apos;m not sure either .
i don &apos;t know you that well .
you don &apos;t know me at all .
that &apos;s right .
i just know you from what you leave behind .
like a tornado .
notice how the artist used the paint .
he wanted to capture a feeling as much as the flower .
i want you to do the same .
use any color that expresses how the flower makes you feel .
no , donna , don &apos;t do that .
there are no mistakes , guys .
great paintings often come out of mistakes .
aria , would you mind spreading out the other prints on the table ?
thief .
thief .
rhonda . it &apos;s one thing to not participate ,
it &apos;s another to disrupt .
she stole my drawing !
no , she didn &apos;t .
this is aria &apos;s first class with us .
just ignore her . she &apos;s having a day .
what happened ?
police may have upset her .
that patient they found dead was her former roommate .
hey , when did you get back ?
last night .
where &apos;s dad ?
my apartment .
i thought i &apos;d give him some space
and come here and maybe talk some sense into mom .
is he okay ?
he &apos;s all right for the moment .
have you been in the barn lately ?
no . no one has .
not since mom fired my sober @-@ buddy . why ?
he may have been sober , but he was a lousy housekeeper .
he left food out .
dad wants to sell the house .
maybe they should .
the house , melissa .
this is our home .
let me throw this away and then we can talk .
no , if he left a mess , i should clean it up .
he was here for me--
no , it &apos;s okay .
just let me do something , okay ? please .
spencer .
what is in here ?
oh , my god !
i told you he left food out .
i have to go wash my hands now .
where have you been ?
i got your s.o.s. when i was at the store .
what &apos;s going on ? what &apos;s wrong ?
what did you say to alison ?
what ?
she just left me a message , pissed .
what did you say to her ?
were you trying to catch her in a lie ?
i don &apos;t need to catch her , okay ?
i &apos;m way ahead of her .
besides who cares if alison &apos;s pissed ?
you &apos;re trying to dump her anyway , right ?
i don &apos;t need you to do that for me .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a beer .
what are we celebrating ?
my freedom .
i walked out of that stupid test .
caleb , why would you do that ?
because algebra and civics ,
they don &apos;t mean a damn thing in the real world , hanna .
wow . you are making some really great life choices right now .
yeah , well , it &apos;s called a decision .
you &apos;re just mad &apos; cause i can make them , you can &apos;t .
how &apos;s this for a decision ?
you need to leave now .
i have a dinner to go to .
enjoy the pot roast .
spencer .
you ready ?
sure .
wow .
wow what ?
nothing . i just--
wow , i forgot how enthusiastic you were about watching things .
have you heard from aria ?
yeah , i just talked to her .
you should have waited .
i can talk to eddie myself once the police finish .
look , in my experience with eddie lamb
he &apos;s much less likely to talk to you
after the police leave .
he wants us to know something .
he left a picture on my doorstep .
yeah , because he &apos;s a good guy ,
but he &apos;s really big on self @-@ preservation .
aria will be fine .
okay ?
she told me not to let you do any heavy lifting .
did you park downstairs ?
around the corner .
good .
i hope your friend &apos;s shed has a lot of room .
it &apos;s a little bit more than aria let on .
actually , would you let me borrow one of those cameras ?
there &apos;s just somebody that i want to keep my eye on .
no problem .
you &apos;re a little out of your neighborhood .
sometimes i just like to walk .
pretty awful , isn &apos;t it ,
how things change so quickly in this town ?
somebody &apos;s your girlfriend , then they &apos;re not .
one day there &apos;s a house and the next day ...
it &apos;s gone .
if you or one of your goon squad play that trick on paige ...
you can call me a lot of names , but don &apos;t call me an amateur .
a dead rat ?
really ?
give my love to alison .
it &apos;s like i said .
thank you for showing up on that roof .
it &apos;s turning into my greatest hit .
it was pretty impressive .
all those boxes ...
all those words , and it wasn &apos;t even the book i wanted to write .
what did you want to write about ?
my family .
my brother and me .
what happened when my parents divorced ,
and my mother and father
changed from who we thought they were to
who they really are .
and i was gonna figure it out all on paper , but ...
i couldn &apos;t .
yeah , well , families can be hard .
so i went with a mystery that i thought i could solve .
and not only did i not solve it ,
i , um ...
i probably made it worse .
i know that feeling .
the camera is for my sister .
she &apos;s connected to all of this .
i just have to figure out how .
maybe we should put down the puzzles and walk away .
now , well , when you figure out how to do that ,
you give me a call , okay ?
you &apos;ll be the first one .
rhonda , what are you doing in here ?
that doesn &apos;t belong to you .
you ripped that out of my book .
where is it ?
rhonda , i don &apos;t ...
she gave these to me , not to you !
who gave them to you ? bethany ?
you know what they do to thieves ?
they cut off their hands .
what you gonna do , little girl , when you &apos;ve got no hands ?
why did bethany give that to you ?
what are you trying to say ? you think i &apos;m a thief ?
you &apos;re the thief !
no .
what &apos;s going on in here ?
what do you think aria stole from you ?
rhonda , i asked you a question .
i need to take my shower now .
i got your text .
cramps ? really ?
sneak up much ?
aria &apos;s stuck at radley , spencer bailed on me .
i mean , it can &apos;t just be ali , my mom and me .
when did your mom start drinking beer ?
she washes her hair with it .
look , i kind of have a headache .
okay , you can have your headache in two weeks
to go with your cramps .
i don &apos;t know .
hanna , my mom is making pop @-@ overs .
you know what that means .
look , i &apos;ve hit my ali limit for one day .
every minute with her
just sucks so much energy out of you .
yeah , well , she &apos;s really nervous about all this .
i mean , the cops have been breathing down her neck .
it &apos;s not the cops , em , it &apos;s your mom .
maybe she could use some practice
getting her story straight . we all could .
yeah , that &apos;s why you need to be there .
em , what &apos;s going on with you two ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s--
ali &apos;s just been really needy .
fine . i &apos;ll get some shoes .
okay .
and brush your hair .
10 minutes , my house . thanks .
who told her she could have that shower stall ?
that &apos;s my shower stall !
everybody around here &apos;s taking all my stuff !
everybody !
mrs. horowitz means well .
i really shouldn &apos;t laugh .
oh , no . seriously , please laugh .
i need as much laughter as i can get .
hey , hanna .
hey , mrs. fields .
sorry , i &apos;m late .
no worries . we were just getting ready to bring things to the table .
do you want something to drink ?
water is fine .
oh , there you go .
em , you want to give me a hand ?
sure .
hey , did you talk to caleb ?
he &apos;s not gonna make any trouble .
a boy like that can make trouble without even trying .
well , i trust him .
i don &apos;t .
now would be a really bad time to make a mistake .
caleb is not a mistake .
he is the most un @-@ mistake thing in my life .
you have to keep a clear head , hanna .
it &apos;s hard to do that when you &apos;re kissing somebody .
so what do you want me to do ?
and keep it simple
because you know i &apos;m not very smart .
i &apos;m just saying .
he came back to town ,
you were still in a relationship .
maybe you should just cool it a little bit ,
make sure that you &apos;re doing the right thing ...
for everybody .
are you telling me not to see caleb ?
who wants a pop @-@ over ?
save one for me .
long day ?
yeah .
i &apos;m actually really late to a friend &apos;s house though , so ...
volunteers don &apos;t usually stay this late .
radley can be a little overwhelming .
well , it &apos;s only my first day .
i &apos;ll catch on .
what are you looking for ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m late . i have to go .
is this ezra fitz ?
so they gave us a deal on the replacement windows .
it &apos;s the second set of widows we bought this year .
al simon said it was a &quot; bad luck &quot; discount .
i could use one of them .
i think we all could .
if you ask me ,
i think people make their own luck .
sometimes things happen that aren &apos;t anybody &apos;s fault .
yeah , like , i don &apos;t know , say like a meteor falls
and hits your car , but the walking around stuff ,
that &apos;s usually somebody else &apos;s fault .
right , ali ?
i think what hanna means is--
no , hanna knows what hanna means .
maybe you &apos;re right , han .
maybe we do set ourselves up for bad things .
we don &apos;t mean to , but we do .
i mean what happened to me ...
there were times in the dark where i would just think ...
&quot; what did i do to anyone
that was so bad to deserve this ? &quot;
you can &apos;t blame yourself for what happened .
sure , in the light ,
in clean clothes and hot plate of food ,
that makes sense .
but when you &apos;re by yourself ,
you don &apos;t even know what day it is .
the only one around to blame is yourself .
i did .
i was so ashamed of what had happened to me .
don &apos;t say that .
i was ashamed .
and that &apos;s why i asked emily and hanna and the others
to not tell anyone when i came back .
and they didn &apos;t .
and that must have been so hard for them .
you have some very special friends , alison .
i know .
you &apos;re the special one , ali .
there is no one in the entire world like you .
cheers .
are you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
can i help you clear ?
please .
great .
hanna .
what ?
i had to have something to wash down all the baloney
we had with dinner .
look , i know that it was my idea ,
but you really cannot go back to radley .
i have to .
look , maybe rhonda knows who visited bethany ,
who bethany &apos;s friends were .
the more i find out , the closer we are to exposing &quot; a. &quot;
let me see that drawing .
this was the last thing that bethany drew .
she must have left radley after this .
yeah , but did she leave hours after ?
weeks ? days ?
and why did she end up at the dilaurentis &apos; house ?
this early stuff is so normal .
it &apos;s just what you draw in art class .
so how did it go today with ezra ?
it was fine .
you didn &apos;t say anything , did you , about ...
aria , why would i slip you into a conversation ?
you guys have done enough slipping on your own .
wait , that looks like a chagall ,
the woman flying like that .
she &apos;s not flying .
she &apos;s falling .
look , look at the vines .
look at the bars on the window .
someone falling at radley ?
toby &apos;s mother ?
you think that bethany saw that ?
well , saw it or heard about it .
wait , you think that bethany was the &quot; fragile patient &quot;
that was on the roof with toby &apos;s mother that night ?
who else knew bethany at radley ?
that &apos;s mrs. dilaurentis , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
mrs. d was on the board .
she was part of the cover @-@ up .
so bethany left radley
and then she went looking for mrs. dilaurentis .
and found someone waiting for her with a shovel .
maybe that person was &quot; a. &quot;
i have to show this to toby .
okay . well , take a picture .
i &apos;ve got to get this back under the mattress
before big rhonda finds out it &apos;s missing .
she really , really doesn &apos;t like people touching her stuff .
okay .
what are you doing ?
taking your keys .
you &apos;re leaving but i don &apos;t think you should drive .
emily , i thought i was helping you--
yeah , i needed help , but you weren &apos;t helping .
here .
i &apos;ll tell them that your mom called
and you had to leave .
you know , all that stuff about her blaming herself ?
your mom didn &apos;t buy it .
i was looking at her .
she wasn &apos;t buying any of it .
hanna , right ?
it &apos;s sydney .
emily &apos;s friend from swim team ?
having a hot date with my homework .
you on your way out or ...
no , i just had dinner over at em &apos;s .
oh , must have been some dinner .
do you want to sit for a minute ?
no , i was just gonna head home .
not like that , you &apos;re not .
wait it out with me .
we &apos;ll split a panini .
okay , i guess i probably could sober up a little bit .
i &apos;ve already yacked on my mom once this week .
um , can i have a soy latte with caramel
and whipped cream ? you ?
same .
did she eat anything ?
just some salad .
i tried to coax her .
she just doesn &apos;t have any appetite .
because she knows whose side you &apos;re on .
i &apos;m not on anyone &apos;s side .
really ? then who is staying in your apartment ?
what was i supposed to do ?
send dad to a hotel because you &apos;re mad at him ?
i &apos;m not mad at him ! okay ?
i &apos;m just trying to figure out who he is
and who you are and what mom and i are up against .
now who &apos;s taking sides ?
this isn &apos;t helping anything ,
you and i going at each other .
it &apos;s bad enough between mom and dad .
parents--
parents are not supposed to stop loving each other .
this is not about love .
if it were about love ,
then there wouldn &apos;t be bodies buried in backyards
up and down the street .
this is about lies
and whispered conversations
that stop when somebody walks into a room .
it &apos;s about alison .
what really happened to her ...
and what happened to that poor girl
who ended up in the ground .
you &apos;re right .
i am ?
but it &apos;s still about love , spencer .
sometimes people do things they can &apos;t explain ...
things that they regret .
but it is still about love .
you were so right .
melted cheese is the best booze @-@ blocker .
you can say that again .
no .
i need a napkin .
i think there &apos;s one under here .
yeah , here you go .
thank you .
i was just reading about that .
so scary .
apparently they lost everything .
yeah . we were at em &apos;s house when it happened .
did you know whoever lived there ?
yeah .
yeah , our friend toby grew up there
with his stepsister jenna .
her name just keeps popping up .
people seem to have a lot of beef with her .
well , she definitely has her own chuck to grind .
and somebody thought
her house would make a good barbecue pit ?
god , i would love to rake her over the coals .
actually , that is not true .
i just think that the whole time
we were fighting someone else &apos;s battle .
have you ever wanted to make up with jenna ?
quit fighting ?
i mean , there was always a possibility
that we could with shana-- jenna .
but after everything that happened in new york ,
it was just too late .
sounds juicy .
last chance for chocolate mousse .
uh , i &apos;m good . thank you .
you know , i &apos;m sorry that hanna had to leave ,
but it was really nice having that time with alison .
why was it so important to have ali here tonight ?
i wanted to see the two of you together .
you know , hindsight &apos;s 20 @-@ 20
and i just realized that maybe you thought of her
as more than just a friend before she left .
i did .
a lot changed while she was gone .
how do you feel now ?
i &apos;m working on it .
you know , emily , i still talk to people ,
you know , people in the police force .
and that story that alison told you
about being kidnapped ...
it &apos;s got some problems .
look , honey , i can &apos;t tell you how your heart should work .
but just remember that you may have saved alison once ...
you don &apos;t have to keep saving her .
hey , if you want we can take these to go
and i can drop you off at home .
yeah , yeah . sure .
um , actually i think i might walk home .
the air , it will probably help .
you sure ?
yeah .
okay .
i &apos;ll see you at school .
thanks . bye .
did you blow off your dinner ?
i got kicked out .
seriously ?
what happened ?
did emily &apos;s mom catch you spitting into your napkin ?
look , hanna , i probably shouldn &apos;t be giving advice about friends .
you handle alison however--
i don &apos;t want to talk about alison .
i want to talk about us .
what do you mean ?
i may be having a hard time making decisions lately ,
but so have you .
and when it comes to me ...
you &apos;ve been on the fence ever since you got back .
look , we &apos;ve talked about this .
you and travis--
there is no &quot; me and travis . &quot;
not when you &apos;re back here .
what do you want ?
i don &apos;t know .
the time that i spent away from here ,
it made me question a lot .
i &apos;m not the same person .
i learned stuff about my family and me ...
and the world .
when i look around this room
i don &apos;t see the same stuff that i used to .
do you see me ?
of course .
then why don &apos;t we just start there ?
hey , paige , it &apos;s me .
i heard what happened to you in the locker room .
i should have called you sooner .
i &apos;m sorry if this was because of what you told me about mona
which i think it was .
i &apos;m sorry i put you in the middle of all this .
if you need anything , please call me .
listen , even if you don &apos;t need anything , just call .
please .
okay , i love--
i &apos;d love to hear from you .
i hope you &apos;re all right .
bye .
紧急求救
i &apos;m walking out my door right now , spencer .
no , i haven &apos;t talked to hanna .
yeah . okay , i &apos;m on my way . bye .
ezra ?
you saw eddie as you were leaving , right ?
yeah . in the parking lot . why ?
he called to set up a meeting .
i waited for over an hour .
eddie never showed up .
that is not how she was dressed when she left .
where is ali going ?
did you see her come back ?
no . not yet .
well , how was she acting when she left your house tonight ?
hard to tell , she left pretty early .
might have been hanna &apos;s fault though .
she was drinking .
in front of your mom ?
yeah , i had to kick her out .
she knows i &apos;m mad .
she might not even show up .
she has to show up .
we have to figure out what ali &apos;s up to .
sorry , you guys , i ran into caleb
and we had a few things to talk about .
what did i miss ?
did you just get the text that came in ?
it &apos;s from &quot; a. &quot;
no .
are you sure ?
check your phone .
i don &apos;t know what text you &apos;re talking about .
&quot; new york , new york , it &apos;s a hell of a town .
ali &apos;s keeping secrets .
maybe that &apos;s because of hanna &apos;s big mouth . &quot;
care to fill us in ?
