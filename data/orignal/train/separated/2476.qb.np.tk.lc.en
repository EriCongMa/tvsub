i have a family , matt .
so did i.
and a girlfriend and a life . and now i don &apos;t .
okay , stef , what happened ?
you told caroline you &apos;d be with her once things were safe ,
and you never showed .
you broke her heart .
virginia forced lucy benett
to seal a vault in the armory with magic .
our other sister yvette was still inside when they closed it .
i need to get her out .
bonnie can help me do that .
i need to know if the effects of those pills can be reversed .
the effects of my blood can &apos;t be reversed .
that would mean you just gave the girl you love a death sentence .
she &apos;s still got a mystical connection
to all those vampires who escaped the phoenix stone .
i would be happy to wipe out anyone off your list
in exchange for a teensy @-@ weensy favor .
and what might that be ?
you &apos;re on your last mortal life .
what we &apos;d like to do is to take that life
and transfer it to bonnie .
well , the good news is
she finally said yes to that deal .
the not as good news is
she added a few more vampires to the list .
i &apos;m here to see a patient of yours , virginia st. john .
and what is your relationship to the patient ?
she tried to kill me .
i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
and i need answers .
your sister alex is hell @-@ bent on having me open that vault .
i need to know what &apos;s in it .
well , that &apos;s the question everyone &apos;s been asking since 1882 ...
when my great @-@ grandfather first managed to open it .
dalton ...
who &apos;s there ?
dalton .
show yourself .
what &apos;s in there ?
what &apos;s in there ?
it &apos;s not a what .
it &apos;s not a who .
it &apos;s what it does to you .
shut it .
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine .
quite all right .
it strips away your compassion .
it takes away your empathy ,
your capacity for love .
eating away at your soul ,
until all that remains ...
is darkness .
my great @-@ grandfather was only in there a few moments .
my sister yvette has been trapped in there for four years .
and i can &apos;t imagine
what she &apos;s been twisted into in that time .
no one can survive four years sealed in a vault .
i said the same thing .
except alex can hear her ,
through the walls , crying to her for help .
whatever &apos;s inside that vault ,
it wants out .
and you have to promise me ,
you won &apos;t let alex set it free .
i promise .
rayna &apos;s list is too long to kill each one twice , mate .
well , then we better get moving .
how &apos;s it going ?
finished off the ones in huntsville and birmingham .
ah , good . overachiever .
somebody taking out their aggression
because blondie left them on the front porch ?
well , damon , you &apos;re the authority on being hated ,
so why don &apos;t you tell me how to deal with the situation .
still mad , huh ?
i &apos;m not mad , i &apos;m just tired .
who &apos;s next on my hit list ?
bloodsucker from the age of enlightenment .
ended up in a mma fighter .
dropping bodies all through the palmetto state .
doesn &apos;t sound very enlightened .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m partnering you up with donovan .
matt ?
he wants me dead . he released rayna to kill me .
bit extreme , even for donovan .
long story .
i don &apos;t have time for a short story , stefan .
listen , you two figure out your differences
while killing this mma fighter .
oh , i guess i don &apos;t really have much of a choice , do i ?
stefan , answering your question about how to deal with being hated ,
three little words : just don &apos;t care .
it &apos;s funny coming from a guy
working so hard to save his friend &apos;s life .
i can live with bonnie hating me ,
just as long as she lives .
i got to go .
i &apos;m driving .
if you &apos;re looking for the crossbow bolts ,
i moved them in with the halloween decorations .
about the same time that i relocated your shotgun from the kitchen .
thanks .
stake guns and vervain grenades are in the minivan .
i called leah over to watch the girls .
they &apos;re going to make puppets and put on a show ,
gonna have the time of their lives .
no , you can &apos;t go . it &apos;s too dangerous .
more for you than me .
it would be irresponsible if we both went .
okay , then you can stay here .
because i cannot read if you give a moose a muffin
for the millionth time
when i know my best friend is in trouble .
good @-@ bye , desmond .
see the crazy train has moved topside .
is that my shirt ?
considering i &apos;m giving you my life ,
i figured it qualified me for an upgrade from the storm cellar .
personally , i would &apos;ve negotiated for the penthouse suite in paris
and dinner at the best restaurant in town
where i would &apos;ve ordered one of everything
and had the most expensive bottle of wine and champagne .
and when all the names are in the fire ,
you &apos;ll have a whole lifetime to do all of it .
guess i don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re getting out of this .
i mean , not to sound ungrateful , but you &apos;re willing to die ?
for me ?
just doesn &apos;t make any sense .
that &apos;s because you haven &apos;t lived seven lifetimes beyond your own .
that &apos;s what i never understood about vampires .
they seek out immortality like it &apos;s some kind of gift .
everything that mattered to me ,
love , family , happiness ,
i had all of that
the first time ,
until it was taken away from me ,
and i &apos;ve spent the last seven lifetimes longing for it .
i &apos;m ready to be done on this earth .
i want to see my father again .
i want to know love again .
that &apos;s what i get out of it .
peace .
your magic &apos;s back .
the pills are out of my system .
which means the armory &apos;s not far behind .
with no traffic , we should be in spartanburg in under two hours .
do you want me to find a decent radio station
to cover up the silence ?
or we can just talk about your vendetta against me .
seriously , man , whatever &apos;s going on , let &apos;s just get it all out .
i mean , you blackmailed us into leaving our home .
wasn &apos;t that enough ?
second best decision i ever made .
do i even want to know what the first is ?
what were you looking at ?
nothing .
baseball score nothing or porn nothing ?
that was a pretty sketchy quick @-@ close .
it &apos;s not important .
i was kidding ,
but now i &apos;m kind of intrigued .
come on .
show me .
go away .
is it , like , weird and freaky ?
i think we &apos;ve reached the point where we can be open and honest
about our browser histories .
let &apos;s see ...
... what kind of freaky stuff you &apos;re into .
top ten ways ...
to propose to her .
pretty sure this isn &apos;t gonna make the list .
yes .
you haven &apos;t even given me a chance to ask .
i said &quot; yes . &quot;
okay .
uh , all right , i guess the only surprise is if ...
to see if i got the size right .
are you rethinking your &quot; yes &quot; ?
first ,
it &apos;s a total home run .
if you &apos;re trying to impress me ,
it worked .
second , you don &apos;t need to impress me .
and i know you can &apos;t afford this on a deputy &apos;s salary .
how about on a sergeant &apos;s salary ?
you got the promotion ?
it &apos;s not official yet .
but they mayor tipped me off .
&quot; sergeant donovan . &quot;
it &apos;s got a nice ring to it , right ?
so does &quot; mrs. sergeant donovan . &quot;
when i got home from the funeral ,
our wedding invitations were sitting on the doorstep .
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s awful .
yeah .
everybody &apos;s sorry .
i heard it was a car accident .
lost control of her truck .
hit a tree .
that &apos;s the official story , anyway .
but you and i both know that &apos;s not what really happened .
hey , bon .
how was your field trip to the nut house ?
where &apos;s enzo ? he &apos;s not answering his phone .
enzo is currently chasing down a blood enthusiast .
what &apos;s wrong ?
my magic &apos;s back .
the armory &apos;s one locator spell away from finding me .
but they don &apos;t know that .
we don &apos;t know that they don &apos;t know that .
listen , bonnie , we are moving on this list , okay ?
if dropping bodies was an olympic sport ,
we &apos;d be on a wheaties box .
come on , you should be used to this by now , right ?
i think you &apos;ve died , what , three times already ?
bonnie ?
yeah , here .
i just want to say thank you .
well , you &apos;re welcome .
i still think it was wrong for you to abandon us ,
but i ... i forgive you .
nope . you are not allowed to use the f word .
you don &apos;t mean it .
you &apos;re only saying you forgive me
because you don &apos;t think that we &apos;re gonna pull this off .
and look , yeah , it &apos;s gonna be tight , bonnie .
but we &apos;re gonna make it .
you &apos;re gonna make it .
so i don &apos;t accept your forgiveness , you understand ?
you are gonna have to stay strong , okay ?
okay .
i will .
you ready ?
this will just make you sicker .
i &apos;m not gonna let them use me to open that vault .
this will only hide your magic for 24 hours .
what about after it wears off ?
then we do it again .
i don &apos;t know how many 24 hours you have left .
alexandria ?
shh , it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m here , yvette .
i &apos;m so alone .
i &apos;ll get you out soon .
i promise .
now they &apos;re getting close , it looks like they &apos;re about to ...
oh , nope . yeah , i got it . no need to elaborate .
okay . thanks .
whew , that is five minutes of crazy i am never getting back .
okay , so this is what i got from rayna .
the girl &apos;s name is ashlynn .
they guy &apos;s name is wyatt .
the rest of her visions are just body parts .
killing spree ?
no , the body parts are ashlynn and wyatt &apos;s .
uh , &apos; cause they &apos;re having sex .
just lots and lots of intense ,
mind @-@ blowing sex .
uh , rayna was very descriptive .
well , that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s good .
yeah .
well , hopefully the afterglow will distract them .
i mean , should i feel even the slightest twinge
of guilt about this ?
no , we &apos;re doing them a favor .
let &apos; em go out on a high note .
rip out their hearts before they inevitably do it to each other .
uh , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s pretty bleak .
you okay over there ?
i &apos;m fine .
look , if you want to talk about stefan , it &apos;s okay , all right ?
we don &apos;t have to pretend that he doesn &apos;t exist .
especially now that he &apos;s showing up at our doorstep .
i didn &apos;t have anything to say to him then .
and i don &apos;t have anything to say about him now .
okay .
what ?
got your voicemail four times .
you know , we are literally at a crossroads here .
we could use a couple bread crumbs .
would you prefer i left bonnie passed out on the bathroom floor ?
she all right ?
no , she took my blood to hide herself from any locator spells .
put her on .
have you lost your mind ?
we spent three years hiding .
i can &apos;t let them find me .
what , and poisoning yourself is a better option ?
you just shortened the already miniscule window of time we have .
we &apos;re so close .
no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re nowhere near done .
i &apos;m staring at a floor covered in names .
and i &apos;ll kill every last one of them .
just come home .
what ?
i don &apos;t want our last moments to be like this .
you a million miles away .
connected only by some crappy cell phone signal .
whatever time i have left , i want to spend it with you .
here .
so just come home .
i know where you are right now .
i &apos;ve been there for three years .
you can &apos;t drink your way out of it ,
you can &apos;t fight your way out of it ,
you can &apos;t kill your way out of it .
trust me , i tried .
this isn &apos;t about you .
it &apos;s not about your fears .
it &apos;s not about your anger .
because if this goes bad ,
you &apos;re gonna have nothing but time ...
to drown yourself in every dark emotion your brain can conjure up .
bonnie doesn &apos;t have that luxury .
so go to her .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t give up .
i &apos;m not asking you to give up .
i need to make sure that she doesn &apos;t .
thanks for getting back to me .
i &apos;ll admit , i was surprised to see you on my phone sheet .
is there something i can do for you , damon ?
i have a rather lengthy list of hell stone rejects
that i need killed posthaste ,
and i hear you have the resources to do it .
i do .
do you have something to offer in return ?
how about a key to your creepy walk @-@ in closet ?
i &apos;m listening .
you finish off that list ,
and i &apos;ll deliver you bonnie bennett .
i think rayna &apos;s gps is off .
i don &apos;t know why a vampire would want to hide out
around so much sharp wood .
you got lots of privacy .
plenty of neighborhoods to grab somebody from .
feed at your leisure .
stash the bodies , no trace .
won &apos;t have to worry about someone like you coming after them .
which makes me curious .
you did such a good job clearing vampires out of mystic falls .
what makes you convinced that penny &apos;s death wasn &apos;t a car accident ?
little things just didn &apos;t add up .
there were no tire marks on the road .
the impact sent a tree limb through the driver &apos;s side of the cab ,
yet the air bag didn &apos;t deploy .
you know , everyone said that i was obsessed
and that i wouldn &apos;t let it go ,
but you know what it reminded me of ?
all the deaths that were covered up as animal attacks .
the more i dug , the less sense it made .
so what did you find ?
that there was at least one vampire in mystic falls
the night penny died .
it was you .
yeah , i was there .
i came back for the anniversary of the sheriff &apos;s death .
i knew it &apos;d be a hard day for caroline ,
and i thought there would be a good chance she &apos;d show up ,
and if she did , i wanted to be there for her .
but she didn &apos;t show , did she ?
no , she never did .
do you really think that i would hurt penny ?
you okay ?
thanks .
we &apos;re getting married this weekend
and we want to get his and her tattoos .
oh , i love that .
&quot; ash . &quot;
is that short for ashley ?
ashlynn .
that &apos;s a beautiful name .
right , honey ?
oh , yeah .
love it . love it .
ashlynn !
sorry , babe .
help me !
poor form , ashlynn !
shoot !
thanks .
i guess we should thank you .
professor saltzman .
you &apos;re both gonna have to come with us .
you came back .
when have i not ?
don &apos;t be sad .
i have decided , i &apos;m not gonna be sad .
i &apos;m not gonna think about all the things
we never got the chance to do together .
i &apos;m gonna be happy .
i &apos;m gonna think about all the things we ...
we did do together .
what , like all the excitement and adventure
i provided you within the confines of these four walls ?
you know ,
it worked for beauty and the beast .
please .
you were never that beastly .
rayna ?
rayna , what &apos;s happening ?
killing .
rayna .
they &apos;re killing them .
good news , brother .
you can pack up your implements of destruction
and punch your time card .
every box in rayna &apos;s list will be checked by tonight .
well , it looks like you pulled it off .
that &apos;s got to tip the scales in your favor with bonnie .
it &apos;s a little more complicated than that .
well , with you , it usually is .
and yeah , by the way , i &apos;m still mad at you .
you put me , quite literally , through hell
and i &apos;m not ready to let that go yet .
but don &apos;t think i &apos;m not noticing all the good
you &apos;ve been doing lately .
keep it up . it means something .
well , it looks like we &apos;re all done here .
no , we &apos;re not .
i don &apos;t think you meant to hurt penny ,
but you know what happened to her .
i couldn &apos;t make sense of my memories from that night , and then ...
i checked the footage on my dash @-@ cam .
it was an accident , matt .
penny didn &apos;t suffer .
and you never saw me here .
you compelled me .
i &apos;m guessing i don &apos;t need to tell you what you said to me .
no , you don &apos;t .
now you &apos;re gonna tell me the truth .
just when i thought you were worthy of forgiveness ,
you do this .
what &apos;d you expect ? just gonna let you die ?
i would rather that , than be forced to open that vault .
what happened to the new bonnie ?
the one that &apos;s not so eager to just sacrifice herself ?
i don &apos;t understand , bonnie .
i have a shaman
ready to make you the proud new owner of rayna &apos;s last life .
all you have to do is just open the stupid vault for alex ,
and you &apos;re well , you &apos;re done .
alex can &apos;t be trusted .
bonnie , stop being so dramatic .
she just wants her sister back .
whatever is in that vault makes people into monsters ,
and i &apos;m not gonna be responsible for letting it out .
you &apos;re pretty quiet on this one .
i think you had a ringside seat
to mary louise and nora &apos;s final few days .
you want to relive those good times , huh ?
bonnie can make her own decisions .
and when she &apos;s dead ,
you &apos;ll be making them for her ,
like what dress she &apos;s gonna be buried in .
i-- geez .
i hit a little bit of a snag , alex ,
but if you just ...
put her on .
it &apos;s for you .
yup .
bonnie , i know you don &apos;t have much time left ,
but i &apos;m hoping you &apos;ll reconsider
now that i have something in my possession
you might be willing to fight for .
oh , my god .
what ?
i don &apos;t believe it .
what ?
lapis de bello .
hmm , this was given to charlemagne by his first wife .
yeah , that explains why he got a second wife .
no , legend has it this allowed him to conquer
half of western europe .
you know , i spent three years searching for this thing .
through every tomb , every monastery throughout europe ,
i couldn &apos;t find it .
i gave up .
i convinced myself it didn &apos;t exist .
there it is .
yeah , well , good thing we got kidnapped ,
&apos;cause now it gives you a little bit of closure .
sorry , it &apos;s-- you were right .
both of us shouldn &apos;t have come .
well , think of it like this ,
if you didn &apos;t , i probably would &apos;ve had my throat ripped out ,
so there &apos;s that .
but this is the longest i &apos;ve ever been away from the girls .
and all i want to do , i just want to get home and hold them .
yeah , i know .
tell me that everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
everything &apos;s gonna be fine ?
yeah , you want to try it again ?
maybe this time where you actually believe it ?
do you know what this place is ?
half of these things should &apos;ve been lost to history .
disappeared .
the other half shouldn &apos;t even exist .
now , if these guys can make all of this disappear ,
they &apos;re gonna have no problem making us disappear ,
so when i say , &quot; yeah , we &apos;re gonna be fine , &quot;
what i &apos;m really saying is i &apos;m praying like hell
that whatever it is they want ,
somebody &apos;s willing to give it to them .
matt ,
i know this is hard for you , but you have to trust me .
anything i tell you will only make it worse .
how am i supposed to trust you ?
you were the last person to see penny alive .
keep you hands where i can see them .
sorry , am i doing something illegal ?
depends on where those blood bags in your trunk came from .
oh , right .
no , i can explain that , i &apos;m ...
a vampire .
i know .
was it self @-@ defense ?
caroline didn &apos;t show up ,
so you needed to take it out on someone else ?
if that &apos;s what you think ,
then maybe you should pull the trigger , matt .
then just tell me what happened .
you don &apos;t want to know .
i need to know .
please .
i need ...
to know the truth .
remember .
penny , you copy ?
penny ?
no .
stefan ?
penny !
penny .
stefan !
hey , you @-@ you have to drink .
come on , come on , you have to drink .
penny , come on , you have to drink , please .
stay with me .
come on , penny , drink .
it &apos;s too late .
no .
matt ?
i &apos;m sorry .
no .
oh , god .
no .
matt .
it was my fault .
it &apos;s okay .
penny ?
i killed her .
i &apos;m sorry .
i killed her .
it &apos;s done .
thank you , bonnie .
you and your friends are free to go .
uh , you do realize by forcing her hand ,
you &apos;ve just dashed any hope of bonnie ever absolving you ?
i didn &apos;t know it took so many words to say &quot; thank you . &quot;
oh , don &apos;t pretend this is all in service
of some altruistic desire to save bonnie .
this was all so you could assuage your own guilt over abandoning her .
was it selfish for me not to want my best friend to die ?
you bet it was .
oh , what , do you want a round of applause for your betrayal ?
bravo . well done .
no , i don &apos;t want applause .
but it &apos;d sure be damn nice to hear you admit
you considered making the same deal .
but you knew you &apos;d lose her .
but lucky for you , you have me .
because she hates me .
it &apos;s humanly impossible for her to hate me
any more than she already does .
so i did what you couldn &apos;t .
and now she &apos;ll hate me , not you .
let &apos;s grab caroline and alaric and get the hell out of here .
come on . now ! run !
be ready for anything .
yvette !
yvette ? !
alexandria .
i &apos;m here .
alexandria .
where are you ? !
yvette .
no .
alexandria .
what have you done to my sister ? !
run !
check all the exits . go .
bonnie ?
what did you just do ?
kept my promise .
no one &apos;s getting out .
bonnie , please !
look , i just didn &apos;t want you to be consumed
by one moment in your life that you couldn &apos;t take back .
i released rayna and helped her kidnap caroline
to punish you for something i did .
can &apos;t blame yourself , matt .
i don &apos;t .
i blame you .
i may have pulled the trigger ,
but none of this would have happened if you hadn &apos;t come back .
why couldn &apos;t you have just stayed away from us ?
i only came back ...
for caroline .
yeah , i know .
but it sounds like she didn &apos;t want that ,
so why don &apos;t you just stay away from her too ?
you ruined my life , stefan .
and you ruined penny &apos;s life too .
whose life are you gonna ruin next ?
it won &apos;t be long now , my darling .
damon and rayna will take it from here .
just ... hang in there .
caroline &apos;s making you her apparently famous &quot; get well &quot; soup .
that soup is awful .
tomorrow is the first rehearsal for the may day pageant .
i signed the girls up for maypole duty .
what are we supposed to tell the teachers ?
&quot; sorry , miss patty .
we missed rehearsal because we were off slaughtering vampires . &quot;
we can get in the car right now .
no , not before i know that bonnie &apos;s gonna be okay .
god only knows how many more ways damon can screw this up
by the end of the day .
are you sure that &apos;s the only reason ?
yeah . why else would i want to stay ?
no , i do not want to see stefan , okay ?
i just want to know . you left things unfinished .
oh , things are finished .
he finished them
when he just ashlynn &apos;d his way out of town three years ago .
and did you see how she just bailed on wyatt like that ?
he was her partner ,
and then the minute things got a little bit messy ,
she just ran away .
i mean , do you see anything about a disaster
of a love affair like that that needs finishing ?
look , i really don &apos;t want to talk about ashlynn or wyatt .
well , i &apos;m not talking about wyatt and ashlynn ,
i am just talking about partnership
and commitment and loyalty and honesty
and all those things that stefan just took away from me .
i understand , but there hasn &apos;t been any closure .
i don &apos;t need closure .
no , i do .
i need closure .
i don &apos;t know if you remember , but my last wedding didn &apos;t go so well .
so if you think that there &apos;s a chance that you and stefan ,
uh , might find your way back together again ,
i &apos;d like to know before i pick out my tie .
no , &apos; cause i want to marry you ,
and i want to be your loyal , honest , committed partner .
and i want our little family to work .
but i don &apos;t want it if you &apos;d rather be with someone else .
look , i love our little family , ric .
it &apos;s unconventional .
but i &apos;m happy .
so if this is the big conversation
where we &apos;re honest about our life together ,
then i think we should talk about the fact
that you &apos;re the one unfulfilled by it .
what do you mean ?
i saw you today .
in that place .
we were being held captive ,
and all you could talk about was some stupid necklace .
it &apos;s pretty clear that you &apos;ve been just indiana jonesing
for something like that for a while now .
look , we &apos;ve been trying so hard to have a normal life ,
but you know what , our life is not normal .
our kids are witch siphons , for god sakes .
we are pretty deep in this .
and if that &apos;s the way that it has to be ,
i want to be deep in it with you .
okay ?
yeah .
well , i can &apos;t say i &apos;m gonna miss you , stabby @-@ pants ,
but you are doing a grande solid for bonnie .
i figure that deserves a &quot; thank you , &quot;
even in my own twisted book .
you &apos;re welcome .
all right .
bonfire , check .
last descendant of the tribe that created you--
by the way , thank you for that-- check .
bonnie &apos;s o @-@ neg , check .
it is a great honor to meet you , rayna .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
look , we &apos;re in a bit of a hurry here , okay ?
so if you can get on with the shamaning ...
hear me , great spirit .
hear me .
we call upon you in this moment of need .
one has come before you .
for many lifetimes as your servant ,
your vengeance ...
let her journey end .
let another take her remaining years .
let another take up her burden .
wait , what ?
what does that mean ?
do you think i could ever forgive you for the things you did to me ?
now neither will bonnie .
when she wakes , she &apos;ll be just like me ,
full of hatred for you and your kind
and unable to rest until you &apos;ve been wiped from this earth .
rayna .
rayna .
