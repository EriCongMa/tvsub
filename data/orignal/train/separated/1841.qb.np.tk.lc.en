every cell in human body regenerates ,
on average , every 7 years .
like snakes ,
in our own way , we shed our skin .
biologically , we &apos;re brand @-@ new people .
are you visiting seattle for the first time ?
oh , no , no . i live in seattle .
i @-@ i just went home for a month .
i took my son to see my parents .
oh . what do you do in seattle ?
uh , i &apos;m a surgeon .
uh , uh , did you know any of those doctors ...
from that shooting ?
we may look the same . we probably do .
the change isn &apos;t visible ...
at least not in most of us .
but we &apos;re all changed ...
completely ...
forever .
but that &apos;s normal .
i mean , it &apos;s a biological imperative change .
so the shooting changed me . i &apos;m changed .
but i &apos;m also ready to get back to work .
i mean , as ready as any of us are
sitting around the house , waiting ...
i just spend my time worrying .
your husband was shot .
that &apos;s a lot to worry about .
i &apos;m worried about cristina .
she &apos;s getting married , and that &apos;s just ...
well , i had to cut her out of her last wedding dress
with scissors , so ...
you watched your husband get shot .
he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s coming back to work today , actually .
we &apos;re all fine .
uh , ex @-@ excuse me .
is everything okay , dr. grey ?
yes . yes . everything &apos;s fine .
opening two .
it doesn &apos;t look too bad .
you just gotta keep an eye on it ,
make sure it doesn &apos;t get any bigger .
but if it changes color , you should see a doctor .
dr. shepherd .
your lady looks pissed .
again , derek ?
有你 我将新生
what ?
nothin &apos; .
just ... you &apos;re awesome .
chief .
oh , dr. bailey . welcome back .
thank you , sir .
we missed you here .
the place isn &apos;t the ... same .
uh , did you get cleared for surgery ?
what do you mean , &quot; cleared for surgery &quot; ?
who has to clear me ?
well , the next time , i &apos;ll leave you there .
you said that already .
oh , derek got arrested again .
meredith ...
reckless endangerment .
please .
did he lose his license yet ?
oh , no , because they don &apos;t charge him ,
because the cops worship him .
because i saved some of their lives .
what are we picking ?
dress color . i &apos;m not wearing white .
it &apos;s sexist and ... vaguely racist .
no white , no veil , no rice .
well , what will your mother say ?
no mother .
you know , i didn &apos;t get cleared for surgery ...
and i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s your fault .
meredith , i am the chief .
i can overrule the counselor .
you can ?
yes .
i love the blue .
chief shepherd , you &apos;re back .
good morning .
i find a giant skull base chordoma .
biggest one i &apos;ve ever seen .
really ?
he came in to the e.r. with trouble breathing .
you got cleared for surgery ?
i did .
bitch .
i like the brown , too .
i know it looks inoperable .
i mean , i would &apos;ve said it was inoperable ,
but you &apos;re back and you &apos;re you .
right .
hey , uh , yes , good morning . thank you . thank you very much .
good . thank you . thank you very much .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s great to be back .
first of all , i &apos;d like to thank dr. webber for stepping up in my absence .
thank you .
uh , i &apos;m grateful for all of you , for all of your support
during my recovery . thank you .
uh , it &apos;s just , uh , so great to be back as chief .
i &apos;m grateful for the , uh ...
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s a lie .
that &apos;s what people say , and , uh , the truth is ...
i hate being chief . i hate it .
chief webber ...
chief webber is our chief .
and i &apos;m sorry , but this giant ...
sorry , i gotta go look at this chordoma .
i , um , i &apos;m sorry , but ...
i quit .
let &apos;s go , kepner . come on .
oh , sorry . okay .
he just quit .
he was supposed to clear me for surgery .
the bullet &apos;s at the surface .
that &apos;s good . i can take it out now .
nah . i mean , if it &apos;s not infected , i &apos; m gonna keep it .
it &apos;s my war wound .
besides ...
chicks dig that crap .
oh , my god .
wow . you weren &apos;t kidding .
the last surgeon broke the dura ,
which enabled the tumor to mushroom into the brain and down into the spine .
it &apos;s wrapped around his brain stem .
whatever we do , we need to do it quickly .
the size of this thing ...
normally i open up the sinuses or the hard palate .
well , now you have to open up both .
you want me to split his whole face open ?
sinuses , hard palate , tongue , jaw--
a broken jaw is excruciating , let alone the rest of it .
does this kid know what he &apos;s in for ?
he wants to live . i don &apos;t think he &apos;s concerned about the pain .
well , but you don &apos;t know how enmeshed the tumor is .
you don &apos;t even know if you can get it all .
thank you , dr. grey .
you want to try this thing ,
torres and i are gonna need to coordinate .
what are we thinking , a week ?
no later .
i &apos;ll clear my schedule .
welcome back , dr. shepherd .
thank you , dr. torres .
you &apos;re not even cleared for surgery yet .
i &apos;ll get cleared .
uh , dr. grey .
chief webber .
yeah , a little-- little exercise .
okay .
mm . something i can do for you ?
yeah . um , that stupid counselor perkins ,
he won &apos;t clear me for surgery .
so i was just wondering ...
no .
but he cleared ...
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . i am .
but we brought in the best ,
and when andrew perkins says you &apos;re not cleared ,
then it &apos;s him you need to talk to .
did you hear that dr. yang and dr. hunt are getting married ?
i did .
it &apos;s pretty great , huh ?
it &apos;s almost like a silver lining .
you know , i @-@ i &apos;ve read a lot about trauma
and how , uh , sometimes people
just up and change their lives .
they say that the trauma
was the best thing that could &apos;ve happened to them .
you know , like dr. shepherd this morning .
did you hear that he &apos;s not chief anymore ?
and how have you been , dr. grey ?
you &apos;ve been through a lot since i last saw you .
does , uh , anyone have anything to say ?
i know that , uh , a lot of you
are only here because this has been mandated .
so let &apos;s talk .
anything at all ?
i ate a really good taco
from one of those trucks by the side of the road .
when ?
last night . you were asleep .
which truck ? the one on 7th ?
i want to i like tacos .
me , too .
i read a book ...
about the history of mass murders in the u.s.
that &apos;s--that &apos;s the actual name of what happened to us .
it was a mass murder . you can &apos;t call it a terrorist attack ,
because the murders weren &apos;t political in nature .
and we weren &apos;t the victims of a serial killer ,
because mr. clark would &apos;ve had to murder several people over a period
longer than 30 days in order tqualify as a serial killer .
we could call it a spree killing ...
which is defined as killings at two or more locations
with no break or pause in between ,
because mr. clark shot that guy in his car before he got here .
but i &apos;m not sure that that counts as a true second location
since it was so close to the hospital ,
which means that we were a mass murder ,
because it happened at one place , by one person ,
and more than four people were killed .
oh , that was quite a show this morning .
i didn &apos;t plan it .
made it better . any regrets ?
no . any regrets about proposing to cristina ?
none .
getting shot turns out to not be the worst thing after all .
i need a best man .
i @-@ i know--
i know we &apos;re not that close , but ...
i don &apos;t know . you being married to the other twisted sister ,
i ... i just thought it ...
it kinda made us like brothers or something .
i &apos;d be honored . it &apos;s an honor .
thank you .
you need a bachelor party ?
no , no , no .
even better .
on the , uh , day of the shooting ,
i understand that you had a particularly difficult day .
on the day i gave birth to my son ,
my husband had a car crash , and he needed a craniotomy ,
and he almost died on derek shepherd &apos;s table .
now that was a particularly difficult day .
and at the end of that day , my son was born ,
and my husband lived .
but at the end of this day ...
no ! no !
um ... this day
was the worst day of my life .
miranda .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to--
no , you--you don &apos;t just sneak up on people . okay ?
you don &apos;t ...
i got these .
i was , um , i was playing golf .
my phone was off , and i &apos;m ...
you know , 18 people got shot , 11 died ,
one in my arms .
a boy died in my arms ,
and you were playing golf .
okay .
bailey--
we gotta go .
well , where-- where you going ?
home , uh , to my mom . right ?
yeah ? we &apos;re gonna go see grandma ?
yeah , tuck . here you go .
when you coming back ?
okay , here , here . here &apos;s your car .
miranda , w-- when are you coming back ?
okay , tuck .
no . no .
m @-@ mom .
you &apos;re talking about slicing his face in half ,
breaking his jaw , cutting his tongue .
it &apos;s just-- it just sounds crazy .
i know .
i wish i could offer some comfort , but honestly ,
there &apos;s no comfort that can be offered in this situation .
let me just say that ...
every medical advancement started with the statement ,
&quot; that sounds crazy . &quot;
let me try .
donna , let me help .
okay . let &apos;s try .
let &apos;s ... okay .
good . okay .
he could not wake up .
he could ... wake up ...
and never be able to move again .
he could go blind .
he could lose his ability to speak or to eat .
he &apos;d require around @-@ the @-@ clock care for the rest of his life .
he could be in a tremendous amount of pain for the rest of his life .
he could die on the table .
if that doesn &apos;t happen , if none of those things happen ,
he &apos;s still facing months
of excruciatingly painful recovery from this surgery .
and before you make a decision ,
you need to understand the risks .
you &apos;re driving awfully fast , dr. shepherd .
the least you could do is wear a seat belt .
you &apos;ve been working .
in the clinic , in the pit .
we haven &apos;t been allowed to operate ,
which makes zero sense if you ask me .
i &apos;d like to , uh , talk to you about the incident last week .
she &apos;s not my responsibility .
she was your girlfriend .
well , she &apos;s not anymore .
karev , give me another suture .
my patient didn &apos;t bring her meds .
she doesn &apos;t even know their names .
i @-@ if i give her albuterol
and she &apos;s on propanolol ,
then she &apos;ll stop breathing .
if--if i give her warfarin
and she &apos;s on ibuprofen , then she &apos;ll--then she &apos;ll bleed out .
if i give her diphenhydramine and she &apos;s on doxepin ,
then she &apos;ll die . so do--do--do you think she wants to die ?
is she kidding ?
karev , what &apos;s going on over there ?
i think that she wants to die .
i think she wants me to kill her .
do--do you--do you-- do you want me to kill you ?
because you-- you could just get a gun ,
and it would be a lot faster .
karev , get her outta here .
you know what ? so why doesn &apos;t somebody find a gun ...
and we &apos;ll bring her a gun and just shoot her ...
karev , help her .
i can &apos;t step away . get her out of here !
help ! somebody find her a gun &apos; cause she wants to die !
i got my own stuff to do .
somebody find something !
why did you walk away ?
look , life is too short .
i almost died trying to stop that guy .
besides , i mean ...
you know how much tail you get offered
when you &apos;re carrying a bullet around in your chest ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;m a legend .
are you , uh ... always this crass ,
or is that a defense mechanism ?
i &apos;ve had too much crazy for one lifetime .
you cleared lexie grey for surgery ?
dr. sloan , i &apos;m in-- i &apos;m in session .
i had to check her into psych last week .
i had to commit her against her will !
and you just clear her for surgery ?
what the hell kind of doctor are you ?
it &apos;s okay . you can talk to him . ?
i &apos;ll come back .
yeah , walk away .
you &apos;re good at that .
she got snowed .
psych put her on heavy doses of
antipsychotics and benzos .
and then she slept for almost 50 hours straight .
when she woke up ,
she was no longer a risk to herself or others .
i mean , she has p.t.s.d.
most of you do .
for her , it caused severe sleep deprivation
and led to a breakdown .
all she needed was sleep .
so protocol is that she goes back to work .
see ?
i &apos;m okay .
really . i &apos;m back .
clamp .
so how are you ? i hear there &apos;s a guy .
yeah , there &apos;s a guy .
that good ?
shut up .
i need another clamp .
so ... you &apos;re getting married .
i am . i am getting married .
i &apos;m happy for you .
i am , really .
really ?
yeah .
thank you .
good .
i dig weddings . i do a mean chicken dance .
there will be no chicken dance .
and if you start a conga line , i &apos;ll physically throw you out .
i just went to the cafeteria ,
and some nurse called me reed
and then said , &quot; i thought you died . &quot;
yeah , you don &apos;t go to the cafeteria for lunch .
they just point and stare .
is that why you dyed your hair ?
they stare because we should &apos;ve died .
pack a lunch . keep it in your locker .
you &apos;re kidding me . you got cleared ? !
it &apos;s down to you and yang .
that is not funny .
well , perkins is no dummy .
he can see the crazy
right under the meredith grey surface .
again , cristina ,
it &apos;s not funny because you &apos;re not
gonna get cleared either , and the two of us
are gonna be serving slushies at the multiplex .
really ? i &apos;d choose dermatology over multiplex .
no , i &apos;d go gynecology over dermatology .
of course you would . perv .
i think i &apos;d go with psych .
that was a joke .
that was good . ha ha . that was good .
anyway , i don &apos;t know what perkins &apos; problem is with me .
maybe he saw your file .
maybe he knew your mother .
maybe he heard how you told the shooter to shoot you .
not funny .
not a joke .
dr. bailey . welcome back .
you okay ?
i &apos;m happy to see you all .
karev , there &apos;s a patient in 23 @-@ 04
that needs an endoscopy .
grey and yang , surely your paycheck covers more than
stuffing your face in the basement .
get to the clinic now .
and , you two ...
i &apos;m awful sorry about the loss of your friends .
thank you .
so are we .
22 @-@ 13 has a bowel impaction ,
and i &apos;m sure as hell not about to stick my hands in there .
you , uh , quit your job this morning .
should i be worried about impulsivity ?
i didn &apos;t quit my job .
being chief wasn &apos;t my job .
i &apos;m a surgeon .
that &apos;s what i do . that is who i am .
but before you got shot--
i wanted to quit that job every day before i got shot ,
i just didn &apos;t have the guts to do it .
after i got shot , i , uh ...
life is short .
so now i think less and ...
just do .
so ... for you , the shooting was clarifying ?
a l--a lot of people died in that shooting .
i &apos;m saying , in your life today ...
a lot of people died .
meredith went to get something to eat .
she should be back soon .
i &apos;m sorry i got you shot .
by coming out of the office--
i didn &apos;t listen , and then you got shot .
i ... i got you shot ,
and i just need to say , i am so ...
april ...
so sorry .
gary clark came here for me .
i gave the order to pull the plug on his wife .
i got everyone shot .
is this what i need to do to get cleared ?
dr. grey , you &apos;re early .
i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll call you later .
yes , please .
that was creepy and inappropriate .
i want a new counselor .
teddy was never a @-@ a patient of mine .
she was cleared for surgery before i got here .
we just met in the cafeteria .
i &apos;m not interested in your love life .
i don &apos;t care how love blooms over day @-@ old hot dogs .
my husband &apos;s about to remove
the largest chordoma on record .
you cleared lexie grey last week .
you cleared alex karev , who insists on
running around the hospital with a bullet in his chest .
i know who i &apos;ve cleared .
so then why don &apos;t you tell me what you want me to say ,
and i &apos;ll say it .
dr. grey , i don &apos;t think that you &apos;re being honest ...
with me or yourself .
and i think that &apos;s a potentially dangerous situation .
so what is it that you &apos;re not saying ?
who &apos;s with derek ?
uh , when i left , um , mark sloan was with him .
and where &apos;s owen ?
um , i don &apos;t know .
i @-@ i @-@ i think he &apos;s still talking to the police .
okay , not a word of this to derek .
you have to tell owen because he knows .
not a word .
okay .
and april kepner . she knows , too .
okay .
well , go--go--go tell them .
go--go back to the hospital and tell them right now .
don &apos;t you want me to stay for this ?
no , i want you to go .
go and--and make sure no one says a word to derek .
okay . okay .
your friend left ?
you want me to wait or ...
no , just do it .
the d &amp; c &apos;s pretty straightforward .
the fetus was only at about 5 weeks .
you &apos;ll feel some cramping after , but it shouldn &apos;t be too bad .
andrew and i just got busted by meredith grey .
callie &apos;s watching me sleep .
what ?
she &apos;s watching me sleep .
and she only watches me sleep when something is up ,
and i &apos;m afraid that she &apos;s gonna propose
or ... start talking about making babies again ,
which i &apos;m--i &apos;m open to , honestly ,
just not right now , you know ?
and i can feel her watching me ,
and it is such hard work to keep my eyes closed ,
but i know that if i open them ,
that something loaded is gonna come out of her beautiful mouth
and pop the pretty pink bubble that we &apos;ve been floating in .
you want to pop the bubble .
i don &apos;t , though .
believe me . i &apos;ve been living in that bubble for years .
oh , no . owen and i ? we &apos;re just friends , really .
finally knowing the truth ? i don &apos;t regret that .
my bubble is so pink and so ... pretty .
pop the bubble .
i heard you were looking for me .
the board officially reinstated me this morning .
no more &quot; interim chief . &quot;
well , i &apos;m glad to hear that .
you sure ? no seller &apos;s remorse ?
oh , have you seen the tumor i &apos;m chasing ?
no , no seller &apos;s remorse .
you feel good about this surgery ?
that sounds like a loaded question .
look , i know perkins cleared you for surgery . uh @-@ huh .
and i know better than to question your judgment , but ...
i still have nightmares , and i go to two a.a. meetings a day .
i &apos;m not all the way back , and i didn &apos;t get shot .
that &apos;s what i mean when i say , do you feel good about it ?
i feel adrenaline .
and , yeah ...
the adrenaline feels good .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m not down there .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m not down there .
palate &apos;s divided .
torres .
yeah . okay . we &apos;re good .
here we go .
you ever see anything like this ?
i &apos;ve seen mortar fire that didn &apos;t do this much damage .
all right , let &apos;s bring that microscope in and get you started .
everybody ready ?
let &apos;s do it .
yeah .
okay .
there &apos;s the tumor .
we &apos;re there . microdissectors , please .
get up .
no .
get up .
let &apos;s go .
sorry , sorry .
what is wrong with you ?
everything is wrong .
derek is decapitating a teenager ,
and april kepner is assisting ,
and you &apos;re sitting reading about lilies of the freaking valley .
well , you prefer peonies ?
we are not better .
cristina , a psychiatrist ,
given several opportunities ,
has deemed me unfit to do my job .
well , he &apos;ll get over it .
just go back in a couple of days .
you are not better .
well , in a couple of days , i &apos;ll be better , too .
in a couple of days , you &apos;ll be married .
are you trying to talk me out of this ?
look at me and tell me you &apos;re sure .
okay , you know what ? no . you don &apos;t get to do this .
okay ? all you get to do is help me break the tie
between the lilies of the valley and the--and the peonies .
that &apos;s it . no , i do get to do this .
i mean , derek &apos;s the love of my life , but you &apos;re my soul mate .
i do get to do this . i mean , why can &apos;t it wait six months ?
please don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
your flowers aren &apos;t going anywhere .
you broke up with him because he couldn &apos;t choose you .
don &apos;t--don &apos;t-- don &apos;t do this .
just why does it have to be right now ?
you know what i think ?
i think you should tell derek about the miscarriage .
we &apos;re talking about you .
we &apos;re talking about us not being &quot; better . &quot;
then you need to tell him .
he &apos;s not ready . he &apos;s--he &apos;s not okay .
well , you &apos;re not okay . you should tell him .
well , dr. yang ,
if you don &apos;t feel ready , there &apos;s no pressure .
the hospital is prepared to work with you in whatever way--
what--i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i &apos;m getting special treatment ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m the girl who operated with a gun to her head ?
if you don &apos;t want to clear me , don &apos;t clear me .
well , you didn &apos;t show up for your appointment last week .
you were very late today .
i &apos;m getting married .
i heard that . congratulations .
can i go now ?
when you think about going into an o.r. ,
how does that make you feel ?
god , the women in these magazines ...
some of them are actually brides , you know ?
they &apos;re not all models .
all smiling .
it &apos;s like the only thing in the world that matters
is that they find the perfect shoe to match that dress .
god , you know , i knew these girls .
i w--i went to school with them .
it &apos;s funny .
i used to feel sorry for them .
they &apos;re simple girls .
they just want to find the guy and get married , you know ...
and live .
i don &apos;t know .
i think you &apos;re either born simple
or you &apos;re born ... me .
i want to be the person
who gets happy over finding the perfect dress .
i want to be simple .
&apos;cause no one holds a gun to the head of a simple girl .
stop fixing him !
owen , help .
who is it ?
i @-@ it &apos;s me . it &apos;s owen .
you &apos;re late .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not okay .
cristina , what is this ?
i don &apos;t want to be alone .
you don &apos;t ever have to be alone again .
i &apos;m not going anywhere , cristina .
i won &apos;t ever leave again . you hear me ?
i am not going anywhere , cristina ...
if you let me stay .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry i was late .

holding myself together with tape and glue .

and maybe you &apos;d be where i am .

thank you .
when we say things like ,
&quot; people don &apos;t change , &quot;
it drives scientists crazy ...
because change is literally
the only constant in all of science .
thank you .
energy ...
matter ...
it &apos;s always changing ...
morphing ...
merging ...
growing ...
dying .
it &apos;s the way people try not to change that &apos;s unnatural ...
the way we cling to what things were
instead of letting them be what they are ...
the way we cling to old memories
instead of forming new ones ...
the way we insist on believing ...
despite every scientific indication ...
that anything in this lifetime is permanent .
change is constant .
how we experience change ...
that &apos;s up to us .
it can feel like death ...
or it can feel like a second chance at life .
if we open our fingers ,
loosen our grips
go with it ...
it can feel like pure adrenaline ...
like at any moment ...
we can have another chance at life ...
like at any moment ...
i do .
we can be born all over again .
