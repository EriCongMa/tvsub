what are you starting with ?
laminectomy .
are you doing it open or endoscopically ?
you know what ? i &apos;m not gonna do this .
what ?
you &apos;re the one who left neuro .
i know .
yeah , well , i &apos;m not gonna do this whole thing
where you &apos;re sad about every case that i have .
i &apos;m not sad .
i &apos;m trying to start a conversation .
okay , well ...
make conversation about something else .
i gotta go .
there are distinct differences between male and female brains .
female brains have a larger hippocampus ...
which usually makes them
better at retention and memory .
okay , i get that you like to put your dirty clothes
in my laundry because , frankly , if you didn &apos;t ,
you &apos;d never have any clean clothes .
fine . i will wash your dirty underpants .
but you know what ? i am not okay with washing
your skank of the week &apos;s dirty underpants .
male brains have a bigger parietal cortex ...
which helps when fending off an attack .
actually , those are ... lexie &apos;s .
thank you .
she w--
oh , yeah .
okay . never mind .
not lexie &apos;s .
nope . lauren , third floor , radiology .
oh . nice .
male brains confront challenges differently than female brains .
it &apos;s three days . we &apos;re gonna be fine .
bye , mommies .
have fun at the conference , mommies .
bye @-@ bye , baby boo .
go .
just one more kiss .
go . come on .
i &apos;m gonna miss you so much .
bye .
see ya .
bye .
women are hardwired to communicate with language ...
it &apos;s just you and me , kid . high five .
detail ...
high five .
dap . blow it up .
empathy .
men ...
not so much .
it doesn &apos;t mean
that we &apos;re any less capable of emotion .
we can talk about our feelings .
it &apos;s just that ...
most of the time ...
we &apos;d really rather not .
great . i come here to eat breakfast ,
and it smells like feet .
what &apos;s another word for &quot; crappy &quot; ?
sucky .
suckity . stankin &apos; .
shut up .

honestly ...
you ever bathe ?
no .
i &apos;ve got that damn africa paper and boards .
man , fifth year blows .
oh . hey .
chief . sorry .
you don &apos;t have to apologize to me .
you &apos;re at the top of the resident food chain .
the world is your oyster .
now if you want to waste your time bitching about it ,
that &apos;s your business .
hey , have you heard anything about anything big coming in today ,
like a car accident
or a building collapse ?
chief , are you trolling for cases ?
dude , don &apos;t you have a laminectomy
with shepherd today ?
yeah , but that &apos;s a snoozefest .
no , don &apos;t you have it now ?
right now .
oh , damn it .
shepherd is gonna have my ass . damn it !
w @-@ wait . wait . just tell him you had an appointment
with mayfield in 22 and it ran long .
he &apos;ll understand .
yeah . okay . thanks , chief .
mm . not--not the chief .
not the chief .
you started ?
i &apos;m supposed to be lead surgeon on this case .
you forfeited the right to take lead
by showing up 20 minutes late .
dr. warren , when you were a fifth year ,
were you late to surgery ?
are you kidding ?
he &apos;s a professional .
and respectful of my o.r. staff .
of your attendings .
definitely my attending .
dr. grey was never late .
no . she was many things ,
but late was not one of them .
see karev here is just trying to sock away
as much non @-@ peds hours as possible .
oh . slummin &apos; it in neuro , huh ?
i &apos;m sorry . i had a-- an appointment
with mayfield in 22 .
it went a little long .
we didn &apos;t--
oh , well , in that case--
we didn &apos;t realize--
why don &apos;t you come in and finish up , then ?
thanks .
uh , can i get a kerrison rongeur ?
thanks .
sloan .
uh , look , i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m putting the word out .
my case load &apos;s been kind of light these days ,
so if you hear of any red meat on the floor--
look at him ,
acting like he runs the place .
he does .
he &apos;s hanging on by his teeth .
it &apos;s undignified .
what are you guys looking at ?
hunt &apos;s not cut out for the job .
what , did something happen ?
nothing happened .
you can see it in his demeanor .
he &apos;s got fear in his eyes .
he &apos;s a decorated military officer .
what do you think got to him , call schedule , lunch order ?
i &apos;m just sayin &apos; , when he belly flops ,
i &apos;m here for the hospital .
you &apos;re a good man .
gentlemen , anything i can do for you ?
just watching the magic .
actually , i &apos;m glad i ran into you .
i &apos;m gonna need your o.r.
we just a call about a big accident
at the convention center .
so i &apos;m gonna have to bump your , uh , brow lift .
did you say big accident ?
watch him .
how big is big exactly ?
hard to tell .
all i know is , the paramedics suggested
that we clear as many beds in the e.r. as possible .
did they now ? okay , what else did they say ?
well , to prep the blood bank ,
that we &apos;re gonna need a lot of blood .
blood ? blood ? uh , uh , did they say anything else ?
not much . it was hard to talk .
there was a lot of commotion in the background ,
you know , some screaming ...
screaming ?
yeah , screaming .
you know , i don &apos;t think i have ever
triaged in a tie before .
well , just tuck it in your belt .
okay .
i don &apos;t know who mayfield in 22 is ,
but that &apos;s the first time
shepherd &apos;s been off my back all week .
webber knows things .
the guy is a freakin &apos; genius .
who &apos;s a genius ?
nobody . um , you look nice today .
have you heard what &apos;s coming in ?
human stampede at a comic convention .
dr. hunt .
which means crush injuries . lots of them .
i have admin on the phone . they say it &apos;s important .
okay , i &apos;ve got an abdominal crush injury .
i &apos;m available .
oh , i have it , sir .
it &apos;s okay , grey . i &apos;m don &apos;t mind .
i have it . it &apos;s too routine for you , sir .
all right , looks like some lower extremity fractures .
i &apos;ll take that for you , chief .
got another one coming in .
dibs on footprint face .
i got an unconscious sexy zombie nurse .
i &apos;ll take it .
oh , no . no , no .
this one is mine !
this is my sexy zombie nurse !
you hear that ?
okay .
bend your knee for me .
good . now your ankle .
15 ...
collector &apos;s edition replicas of the &lt; i &gt; doctor who &lt; / i &gt;
tardis in original packaging , signed by russell t. davies ,
free to the first 15 people through the door ,
and i was there ,
right in the middle of it .
your other knee .
i &apos;m never in the middle of anything .
ankle .
i have battle wounds .
all right . i &apos;m gonna get you some painkillers ,
and then we &apos;ll get you up to x @-@ rays .
oh , god . okay .
am i gonna walk again ?
no .
i &apos;m just messing with you . you &apos;re fine .
just got a few broken toes , if that .
just toes ?
yeah .
d @-@ do i at least get a cast for that ?
primary survey looks good .
okay . well , this laceration looks deep .
let &apos;s set up a suture kit and 4 @-@ 0 vicryl .
right away , doctor .
this is , um ...
why isn &apos;t this bleeding ?
what is ...
it &apos;s fake .
the damn thing is fake .
ah , never mind .
moving on to the laceration on her clavicle .
you gotta be kidding me .
look , is there any real blood here at all ?
it was crazy .
500 people trying to fit through this one little door .
hell , that kid in the borg costume
tripped me on purpose .
they just kept coming and coming ,
like they didn &apos;t even realize
they were running over a human being .
all right , guys , we got neck tenderness ,
so we want to be careful on this .
one , two , three .
the worst part was when keith &apos;s head
got caught on this one guy &apos;s costume and--
and it ripped off his ear ?
that &apos;s bad , isn &apos;t it ?
how did nobody mention that your ear is ripped off ?
well , we looked around on the floor for a while ,
but it &apos;s probably , like
stuck to some stormtrooper &apos;s boot .
well , at least we got what we came for .
we got a tardis .
i got a tardis .
you broke seven toes , but really five
&apos;cause pinkie toes barely count .
so we &apos;re just gonna tape &apos; em up and get you outta here .
tape ?
i survive a human stampede ,
and all i get is tape ?
i &apos;ll throw in some crutches .
you don &apos;t look like you &apos;ve got great balance .
what are you supposed to be anyway ?
i &apos;m a hobbit .
we &apos;re a gentle folk
from a farming community called the shire .
it &apos;s in the northwest corner of middle earth .
we live a ... simple life ,
but we crave ... adventure .
and when we find it ,
some become heroes .
the dothraki princess .
yeah . i stopped caring about ten minutes ago .
no . that--that doctor over there looks just like
the dothraki princess from the legendary &lt; i &gt; song of ice and fire &lt; / i &gt; series .
not her hair , but her--her--her skin
and her eyes , and ...
oh , oh , god . oh , god . here she comes .
her ?
you have nerd chub for kepner ?
kepner .
karev , trauma room , now .
kepner .
give me my tardis !
it &apos;s not yours ! i fought for it !
i lost an ear for it !
karev . please .
no , he &apos;s stealing my tardis !
let &apos;s go .
just stop him .
mr. hitchens ,
your ear has lost all of its soft tissue , but--
we &apos;ll be able to construct an entirely new ear .
we &apos;ll take cartilage from your ribs
and match it to the exact size and shape of your existing ear .
it &apos;s a long process ,
but when we &apos;re finished , that ear will look good .
anything you want to add , avery ?
no . you covered it .
mr. hitchens ,
what are you feeling right now ?
hurt , betrayed .
anything in your legs ?
no .
nothing .
all right . he needs an m.r.i ..
right away , okay ?
you paged . what &apos;s going on ?
dr. warren &apos;s resident
punctured the dura of your patient from this morning
during what should have been a routine epidural .
okay , first of all , there &apos;s no such thing
as anything routine after a patient &apos;s had surgery .
and you have no right to yell at my resident .
there was spinal fluid all over her bed .
how is the patient ?
just checked on her . she &apos;s stable and pain free .
your resident was sloppy and rushed .
you have no idea how difficult epidurals can be .
because i &apos;m a nurse ?
watch your tone with me .
or what ? what are you gonna do ?
okay , okay , done . break it up .
walk away . we &apos;re done .
walk away .
walk away .
i get why you &apos;re mad at the guy ,
but if you &apos;re gonna have a fight about bailey ,
do it on your own time .
fight about bailey ?
wait . no .
no , b @-@ bailey-- bailey &apos;s with him ? !
i should go .
like they went to dinner once or twice or--
you really don &apos;t want to know .
shepherd .
like don &apos;t go into the conference room
on eight or nine without knocking .
oh , come on .
you asked .
does she talk about him ?
yeah , she said his hands have a kind of tenderness ,
uh , some kind of magic .
you &apos;re an ass .
don &apos;t yell at my nurses , even the men .
sure . just drop a bomb and walk away .
walk away !
uh , okay , what &apos;s next ?
sign these ,
and these .
and this needs to be in by this afternoon .
well , i will look at that right now . thank you .
sure .
all right .
coming through !
code blue in 32 @-@ 12 .
code blue , 32 @-@ 12 .
hey , avery , check this out .
damn .
c @-@ 6 is totally shattered .
i know .
i used to eat my lunch here , too .
yeah .
helps break up the day and gets you outta the office
and let &apos;s you feel like you &apos;re still in the action .
yeah .
is there something you might need me for ?
oh , oh , no , no .
i &apos;m just cutting through on my way to the skills lab .
actually , um ...
you gonna eat those grapes ?
how are the scans ?
he &apos;s got a burst fracture of c @-@ 6
so we need to do discectomies above and below .
i thought i &apos;d put in a fibular graft and a plate .
sounds like a good plan .
you think since i &apos;m operating in two places ,
that this could count as two neurosurgeries ?
because you need to log more non @-@ peds surgeries ?
yeah .
that &apos;s your question ?
young man &apos;s spine is pulverized .
you blink once , he may never walk again .
you don &apos;t want to talk to me about the surgery ?
you want to ask to see if you can get two gold stars
instead of one ?
no , i--
just get outta here . you &apos;re off my service .
go .
shepherd just kicked me off neuro
&apos;cause i don &apos;t piss myself every time i look at a spine .
the guy is a douche .
his wife was his resident , and now he &apos;s got you .
tough act to follow .
sorry , chief .
i &apos;m not the chief .
we &apos;re practicing microsurgery techniques .
not for snacking .
you know , you two need to find a way
to start feeling the joy again .
i mean , there &apos;s gonna come a time
when you &apos;re gonna be wishing you were fifth year again
just to get back in the o.r. and get your hands dirty .
you &apos;ll operate on a grape
just so you &apos;ll keep from getting rusty .
you &apos;re in the o.r. all the time .
to supervise , sure .
they &apos;ll bring me in on a really complicated part .
but i never open , i never close .
is this a technique i could use on an ear reconstruction ?
yeah , now you see there ?
avery &apos;s starting to feel the joy .
pull up a grape .
yes .
please .
sloan won &apos;t let him touch an instrument .
he barely lets him finish a sentence .
at least he lets me in the o.r.
can i get you a grape ?
thanks , but robbins says she &apos;s kicking me to the curb
if i don &apos;t publish .
i gotta do my damn africa paper .
he &apos;s not feeling the joy .
nope .
now you see this , how i &apos;m doing it here ?
wow . that bad , huh ?
i &apos;m completely buried in paperwork .
i &apos;m chained to this damned desk .
finish your drink . let &apos;s get outta here .
and go where ?
just finish your drink .
i don &apos;t understand .
your contractor doesn &apos;t care
that you &apos;re building this deck yourself ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t say that ,
but he does work for me .
if i didn &apos;t have this ... i &apos;d kill my resident .
karev ?
ah , he &apos;s just not interested .
the vertebral column was wide open ,
perfect view of the cord--
it &apos;s beautiful . he just could care less .
he &apos;s just punching a time clock .
he &apos;s not meredith .
no , he &apos;s not .
you know , when you quit as chief ,
i thought you were out of your mind .
now not so much ?
is it me or is everyone in the hospital
just waiting for me to fall on my face ?
oh , no . we all got money on it .
i got you down for $ 100
that you make it at least six months , so buck up .
i &apos;ve been walking on eggshells at home for weeks .
i used to come to work to let off steam , and now ...
that &apos;s become a nightmare , too .
and then dada used
5 @-@ 0 monocryl inside the big man &apos;s nose ,
and poof !
like magic , there was no scar at all .
we &apos;re fine , just like we were 20 minutes ago
and 20 minutes before that .
are you gonna keep this up all three days ?
because it got old hours ago .
oh , god .
mark ? mark ?
are you there ?
guess who just rolled over for the first time .
karev !
hunt told me i could take his chair .
sofia rolled off the sofa last night ,
and she hasn &apos;t cried since . something &apos;s wrong .
yeah , i &apos;m not a pediatrician . sorry .
if i tell anyone in peds , they &apos;ll call arizona .
yeah , i got a paper to write .
you drop what you &apos;re doing right now
by the time i count to three , or i will end you .
one , two ...
all right , the residents &apos; lounge needs a new couch .
make sure that gets there .
and let &apos;s see if the nurses &apos; station
on the third floor could use this desk .
mm @-@ hmm .
okay . thank you .
i know . i know what you &apos;re thinking ,
and no ,
as much as you might want me to , i am not resigning .
i &apos;m just getting rid of a few things
that i don &apos;t feel i need to be chief .
and you can say what you want about
how i &apos;m gonna need my office or need my desk .
i say you &apos;re wrong .
i say my office can be wherever i am . okay ?
the procedure went well ,
but your spine is still very fragile .
good news . we found the ear .
i found it .
uh , i went back to the convention center ,
stayed there all night , looking through dumpsters and trash .
but guess where it was .
the lost and found , hooked on to some crazy helmet .
where &apos;s my tardis ?
okay .
how about a &quot; thank you , greg , for finding my ear
in the trash &quot; ?
i don &apos;t care about my ear . i care about the tardis .
we care about the ear , keith .
keith , try not to move , okay ?
fine .
can you at least ...
keep it in the living room so i can look at it ?
actually ...
oh , my god . you sold it , didn &apos;t you ?
you sold it ? !
no !
i &apos;ll stabilize his neck .
all right , move your fingers for me .
your toes .
is he okay ?
move your toes .
is he okay ?
i don &apos;t know .
his lower extremities just went limp .
keith , try and move your feet for me , please .
now wiggle your toes .
she &apos;s usually a lot more alert than this .
i sat up with her all night ,
checking to make sure she was still breathing .
maybe the reason she &apos;s not alert
is because you kept her up all night .
what &apos;s that ?
right there . see that ?
yeah . it &apos;s a perfectly healthy brain
of a perfectly healthy baby
who didn &apos;t need a c.t. scan .
the baby &apos;s fine . i &apos;m going now .
yeah , there &apos;s the tiger .
ooh , there &apos;s the tiger .
the guy threw a beer bottle at me .
who throws bottles at people &apos;s heads ?
carter ?
w @-@ why are you back ?
the nurse says you think i missed something .
get off me !
you stupid kids with your idiot convention !
every year , you line up on my lawn ,
block my driveway .
it &apos;s my property , got it ? !
i &apos;m gonna have you arrested !
you threw a bottle at me !
sir , get back in the gurney right now !
i need you back in the gurney . thank you .
bed six , please .
you &apos;re here to see kepner again .
uh , no . i &apos;m here for an exam . i feel sick .
look , why don &apos;t i give her your number , you get outta here ,
you give her a call , get your geek on ?
oh , no . i could never--
trust me . you two have more in common than you think .
couldn &apos;t you just admit me as a patient for the day ?
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
but what if my foot was hurting , or my leg ?
i &apos;m not giving up a bed for a stalker with fake symptoms .
forget it .
i have chest pains ,
which means you-- you have to admit me
and keep me for observation , right ?
keith reinjured his spine , creating an epidural bleed
that needs to be addressed as soon as possible .
so does the ear .
his ear is cosmetic . the bleed could leave him paralyzed .
the ear &apos;s been detached for over 20 hours .
if we don &apos;t reattach it soon , it won &apos;t be viable at all .
are you going in through the front of the neck
to get to the spine ?
yes .
so the patient will be on his back already .
why don &apos;t we insert the ear into the abdomen ?
keep it viable with the blood supply there ,
let you operate on the spine .
take it out tomorrow , reattach it .
good idea .
really good idea .
shep , you need me ?
so i ... just swung by your office , and you weren &apos;t there .
neither was any of your furniture .
my office is where i am .
you &apos;re really taking this
&quot; not being chained behind your desk &quot; thing seriously .
mm . you find a new resident yet ?
i might have a candidate .
by the way , my contractor called .
the lumber for the deck is in .
i &apos;m there . i get the power saw .
yeah , that &apos;s what real pain feels like .
you , uh , think she &apos;s okay over there with that guy ?
she &apos;s fine .
get off of me !
sir , if you do not calm down ,
we will have to restrain you .
uh , are you ...
oh , i &apos;m leaving .
are you sure she &apos;s okay ?
call security !
sir . sir . what the hell ?
i have to protect my house !
oh , god . he &apos;s hulking out .
security !
give me 5 of haloperidol i.m.
i have to protect my house !
can we get some help ? !
uh , hey . uh , hey .
get off me !
uh , somebody , they--they need some help over there .
i said no !
get off of me !
you &apos;ve gotta hold him still !
i &apos;m trying !
we are a gentle folk ...
who crave adventure .
we are a gentle folk who crave adventure .
when we find it , we become ...
heroes .
i can &apos;t be here !
someone stop him !
excuse me , uh , sir .
you need to calm down right now and stop--
screw you !
where is he ?
around the corner .
book o.r. two for a possible concussion and a broken jaw .
we have a patient with a broken jaw ?
we &apos;re about to .
i &apos;m on it .
is it true , did you punch a guy ?
shep , i need a neuro consult .
why , because you punched a guy ?
what &apos;s this i hear about you punching a guy ?
all right , yes , i punched a patient
who was endangering the safety of my nurses ,
my residents , and other patients .
you know you &apos;re the chief not the sheriff , right ?
scan is clear .
thank you , all of you , really .
all right .
somebody paged me ?
this is carter .
he just got into a fight with a guy twice his size .
there &apos;s a lot of blood in the peritoneal cavity
and a splenic laceration .
well , this could take a while to fix .
well , you said you wanted to get your hands dirty , so ...
yeah . okay , now where do you think you &apos;re going ?
oh , i don &apos;t need trauma hours .
i need , uh , neuro hours and to finish my paper .
no , you &apos;re not going anywhere .
boki , you still have my playlist on rotation ?
well , crank it up .
i had a meeting in the conference room on nine .
great deal of difficulty concentrating .
you asked .
yeah , but you knew i didn &apos;t really want to know
and you told me anyway because you enjoy my pain .
well , next time , you won &apos;t ask .
you have a reputation for being a nice person .
i think it &apos;s a load of crap .
you know what ? i &apos;m building a deck .
why don &apos;t you come by tonight , take it out on the deck ?
that work for you , hitting things ?
doesn &apos;t hurt .
you know , before you insert that ear , avery ,
why don &apos;t you move over and let me show you
that trick for creating a subcutaneous pocket ?
you showed me that last week , twice .
and now i &apos;m gonna show you again .
where &apos;s your resident , anyway ?
don &apos;t tell me he &apos;s late for an epidural decompression .
avery .
ever decompress a spinal hematoma before ?
i &apos;ve seen one on a video , yeah .
great . do this one .
what ?
what ?
i &apos;m right here if you need me .
start with the , uh , leksell ,
work your way down through the bone to the dura .
hard for you to see what i &apos;m doing , avery , from all the way over there .
well , i figured you could spare him since his hands are free .
excellent control with the epidural vein , avery .
i &apos;m surprised you never considered neuro .
i was hoping you &apos;d consider
letting me create the pocket myself next time .
shepherd let you touch a vertebra ,
now you &apos;re ready to rebuild a face by yourself ?
no .
i just want a chance to try to practice
your surgical trick
on something other than fruit .
you &apos;re not ready . that &apos;s why you &apos;re working on fruit .
when you &apos;re done maiming fruit , we &apos;ll talk about it .
everything okay ?
this may be out of line ,
but is there any way i can come over to your place
and hammer something ?
i like your initiative , avery .
so the wiseass from legal tells me
i need to apologize to the drunk who tore up my e.r.
she wasn &apos;t ready for a relationship ,
and now she &apos;s in one .
right . so where is the accountability ?
that &apos;s what i want to know . what the--
you guys always get worked up like this ?
you should give it a try .
no . i &apos;m good .
just ... hammering .
okay .
thanks for this , by the way .
i know sloan &apos;s my boss , and he &apos;s your friend .
i wouldn &apos;t want to overstep .
not that i ever get a chance to overstep with him .
since he has me on training wheels ,
which is fine most days , except ...
when i get home , and it turns out that my girlfriend ,
who is a fourth year , has done more surgery than me .
then she asks me how my day went ,
and the answer is , &quot; great , sweetheart .
i just spent the last nine hours standing around
watching your ex operate . &quot;
i know you feel you have somewhere better to be right now ,
but you don &apos;t .
i just want to finish my paper , sir .
it all falls away--
the research , the tests , the papers .
we do it to get to this .
adele does that .
what ?
she &quot; uh @-@ huhs &quot; me .
every night when i fill her in on my day ,
she nods and gives me a lot of &quot; uh @-@ huhs . &quot;
but i can tell that she &apos;s uncomfortable
because half the time ,
she can &apos;t remember where i work .
and it makes her nervous when i say i &apos;m cutting people open .
sometimes you can &apos;t see the joyful part of your life until it &apos;s over .
this is it , karev .
it &apos;s right now .
you &apos;re in it .
oh , he &apos;s bottoming out .
grab the hilum and hold pressure so i can get a better look .

uh , with mayfield
in 22 .
oh . okay .
um , that--sure . yeah , that--
that--that &apos;s fine .
right-- right , dr. bailey ?
some things , avery , i just don &apos;t need to know .
avery .

uh , wouldn &apos;t miss it .
we still on for the a.v.m. tomorrow ?
yes . absolutely .
good .
i finished--19 pages .
oh , well done .
hey , hand it over .
oh , no . it &apos;s not ready for anyone to--
hey , uh , dude , give that back .
oh , you &apos;re gonna fight the chief ?
you &apos;re not the chief .
once you &apos;re the president , you &apos;re always mr. president .
now shepherd wants me on his surgery ,
which is great , obviously ,
but i &apos;m supposed to be in surgery with sloan at the same time .
how am i supposed to choose ?
who do you want to work with more ?
i dig plastics ,
but i &apos;d like to actually be able to operate .
well , you &apos;re choosing between two world @-@ class surgeons .
this is not a problem .
it is a privilege . embrace it .
yeah , feel the joy .
look at you .
hey , how &apos;d you get out of your skills lab with bailey ?
oh . mayfield excuse .
you used the mayfield excuse on bailey ?
yes , sir .
i know , right ?
right ?
you ... with bailey ?
you want a grape ?
what happened ?
well , you must have run the c.t. wrong or something ,
because it &apos;s been over 27 hours , and she still hasn &apos;t cried yet .
something &apos;s wrong .
you want to know why your kid isn &apos;t crying ?
because she likes you .
you &apos;re a good dad . she &apos;s happy .
you want to see her cry ?
there .
now she &apos;s crying .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
they look happy .
yeah , they do .
guess i &apos;ll be seeing you at the deck tonight .
the guy was twice my size .
what was i thinking ? i &apos;m an idiot .
or a hobbit .
what ?
that &apos;s what you said , right ?
when hobbits find adventure , they become heroes .
you stepped up .
all right , so you got flattened by a giant .
it &apos;s still cool .
and i &apos;m not the only one who thinks so .
all right .
remember ...
all you have to do is say hi .
let her do the rest .
wait . wait . hang on .
thank you for what you did ,
standing up to that guy the other day .
that was so brave .
i was a hobbit .
okay .
uh , i &apos;m not really familiar with hobbits ,
but anyway , that ...
okay . thank you . bye .
what ever happened to just saying hi ?
not familiar with hobbits ?
they &apos;re only the central figures
in one of the most famous pieces of literature in history ,
not to mention the subject
of one of the highest @-@ grossing film franchises ever ,
but , okay , not familiar with hobbits .
sure .
you get that ear prepped yet ?
i may ...
have to scrub out of your rhinoplasty
just a little--just a little early tomorrow
if that &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re in my light .
uh , last night , shepherd asked me to scrub in on his a.v.m. surgery ,
which is a big opportunity for me ,
because he &apos;s gonna--he &apos;s gonna let me take the lead , so--
last night ?
you were with shepherd last night ? where ?
oh , just ...
what ?
at his deck .
at his deck ?
yeah .
you &apos;re right .
taking the lead on a surgery is a big opportunity .
you should not pass up .
that &apos;s why ...
i &apos;d like you to take the lead now .
sew this guy &apos;s ear back on by yourself .
thank you .
don &apos;t screw it up .
hello . i &apos;m dr. hunt .
i am the surgeon who repaired your broken jaw .
i am also the guy who broke it .
uh , it &apos;s wired shut right now so , uh .
i &apos;ll do the talking .
now they want me to come down here
and apologize to you .
and i want to make something ...
quite clear .
i feel good about what i did .
now i reviewed the security tape ,
and i easily prevented half a dozen people being injured by you .
you assaulted a girl
with a beer bottle .
you attacked hospital staff .
you put a man on the critical list .
you were violent and abusive
in front of dozens of witnesses ,
and i will stand up in any court of law
and say just that .
i do not apologize for things i feel good about .
and i feel good about this .
so ...
if you want to sue ,
you sue .
and good luck with your recovery .
take a look .
dr. jason mayfield ...
e.d. specialist ?
room 22 . mayfield in 22 .
you told bailey you had erectile dysfunction .
you told shepherd .
oh , hey , karev . there you are .
just read your paper .
excellent first draft .
oh , uh , and , uh ...
don &apos;t hang out by mayfield .
people get the wrong idea .
yeah .
ah , this looks fantastic , keith .
you should have very minimal scarring .
go away .
no .
sorry ? i &apos;ve got a bad ear .
pretty sure i didn &apos;t hear that right .
okay , yeah , i sold the tardis .
but as your friend , i &apos;m gonna be honest with you .
it was the right thing to do .
our place is crammed with all that stuff you collect .
you spend all your money on it . you &apos;re broke .
and do you have any idea how many medical bills
you &apos;re about to have ?
that tardis was worth cash--
real actual cash-- that you don &apos;t have .
so , yeah , i am sorry that i sold your precious tardis .
i am .
but i did it for you .
who &apos;d you sell it to , anyway ?
the guy with the comic store . the one in san diego .
morris ?
i hate that guy .
how much did you get for it ?
$ 7,500 .
well , he ripped you off .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
the chief beat the crap out of my paper .
i basically have to start all over .
i can &apos;t believe this .
i am back where i started three days ago--
no paper , no neuro cases .
i mean , it sucks .
grab your coat .
this is a bad idea .
shepherd hates me .
i hate the woods .
you know there are bears out here ?
i hope you don &apos;t mind .
i @-@ i brought karev .
fifth year is really kicking my ass .
i mean , it &apos;s no excuse , all right ?
but i didn &apos;t mean to be disrespectful or whatever .
also , i lied about mayfield ,
just to be clear .
derek .
you &apos;re trying to steal my guy .
he &apos;s my guy . avery , go get in the car .
what ? no .
mark ...
you &apos;ve been moving in on him all week .
you weren &apos;t even interested in him
till you saw how much he meant to me .
i don &apos;t take the time to teach anyone if i can help it .
mark ...
but i &apos;m taking the time with avery .
because he &apos;s a quick learner
and he can do a z @-@ plasty better than i could at his level .
i can ?
hey , hey , don &apos;t do that .
don &apos;t ... don &apos;t just yell at me , then walk away .
i &apos;m not . it &apos;s just , sofia likes it if i &apos;m moving .
you guys talk .
i &apos;ll take the baby .
okay , careful . we had a scare this week .
okay . all right .
now ...
thank you .
avery , go get in the car !
how are you tonight ?
you good ? you want to come and sit with me ?
here we go .
we &apos;re just gonna sit right here .
and have a look at the little tree up there .
friends don &apos;t steal from each other .
it &apos;s not stealing if he asks to scrub in on my surgery .
oh , don &apos;t be a jackass .
all right , look .
i appreciate this , i do ,
but if i have to choose , i choose plastics .
i mean , i really appreciate
being able to take the lead on your neurosurgeries ,
but i feel like ...
you using my boy here
to get more surgery ?
nobody uses my boy .
why are we the only ones with hammers ?
i &apos;m getting a beer .
be a man .
people say it all the time .
you want to play with the truck ?
you can touch the truck .
but what does that even mean ?
honey .
dinner &apos;s ready .
is it about strength ?
we &apos;re gonna sing a song
and look at the tree .
are you tired ?
you &apos;re tired .
right ?
is it about sacrifice ?
what do you think they &apos;re talking about ?
my guess ?
which one of &apos; em gets to take you to prom .
is it about winning ?
maybe it &apos;s simpler than that .
you &apos;re not getting laid .
that &apos;s why you have
this sudden interest in education .
when richard asked you
who should be the next chief ...
did my name come up ?
you just had a baby . you don &apos;t want to be chief .
and he didn &apos;t ask me .
what if he &apos;d asked ?
you just had a baby .
you know , a few weeks ago ...
i knew exactly how the next ten years would play out ...
work , family ...
and , uh , then ...
i lost the trial ,
baby ...
blacklisted by the fda .
and meredith ...
some days , i miss her so much ,
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m gonna make it .
you have to know when not to man up .
did you tell hunt any of this ?
i did not .
just checking .
i think sofia needs a change .
here .
i &apos;ll tell you what else you don &apos;t know ,
is how to build a deck .
this thing isn &apos;t level .
i gotta call my contractor .
sometimes it takes a real man
to set his ego aside ,
admit defeat .
and simply ...
