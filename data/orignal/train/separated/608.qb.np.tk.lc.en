at 60 % less fat and 20 % less price , the only thing
kolb family family pack ham packs don &apos;t have less of is flavor .
haaaaaaaaaaam , gurrrrl ! .
family pack ham packs , from kolb family farms ,
the family that &apos;s pleased to meat you .
haaaaaaaaaaam , gurrrrl !
you don &apos;t know his name , but you know what he says ,
and you love how he says it .
haaaaaaam gurl !
haaaaaaam gurl !
haaaaaaam gurl !
so , who is the man who started it all ?
ben chang , and we have him here with us today .
you are the ham girl guy .
yes , i am the ham girl guy .
how did this happen ?
well , i just kept auditioning , you know , kept working hard .
and now ?
spielberg is calling .
not you know , i don &apos;t go by phone calls .
i go by contracts .
but spielberg is interested in you for the color blue .
in the new play dough movie , is that right ?
maybe , you know , maybe .
but like i always say , you know , life is a roller coaster .
you were a teacher at a community college in colorado .
did you just- .
true .
one day in class say ,
class dismissed , i &apos;m headed to hollywood ?
i mean .
how did your students react to that ?
well , you know , i haven &apos;t spoken to them , really .
i.
there &apos;s not much for me back there .
no friends ?
you know , i was kind of a loner ,
people , you know , made fun of me for it ,
but i just kept my head down and stayed focused on my work .
well they &apos;re making fun of you now , are they ?
no , they are not .
can i get a ham girl ?
haaaaaaaaaaam , gurrrrl !
you know , i don &apos;t know if that was- .
and there it is , ladies and gentlemen ,
from community college to something a little bit better .
turn it off .
ben chang is on a rocket ship
to eternal validation .
turn it off .
thank &apos;s so much for being .
well it &apos;s been three weeks .
i &apos;m having his car towed .
第六季 第八集
to chang .
may your success be brief , and your colds last months .
jeff .
hey , get out of greendale , or you get me in your corner ,
you don &apos;t get both .
ham , girl .
who would have predicted chang becoming famous ?
technically , i did , remember ?
only , i thought it would be for- .
eating someone , yeah .
you think that spielberg stuff is really happening ?
how could that happen ?
that would mean the world was insane .
haaaaaaaaaaam , gurrrrl !
not to be crass , but there is an upside to this , financially .
chang &apos;s absence lowers our insurance premiums 6 % .
there &apos;s nothing but upsides to him leaving .
i think we all just feel a little short changed .
we invested so much in him
when no one else would .
because we all assumed he was
so insane he would die if we kicked him out .
this whole time it turns out we were holding him back .
we thought he was bedrock .
but it turns out he was the ceiling of a cavern filled with us .
i have already forgotten his name .
did you ever really know his name ?
the chinese fellow , right ?
whose name was some kind of noise ?
clang , bang , merengue .
looks like i &apos;m the only one who &apos;s not glad he &apos;s gone .
at least i can finally clear some space in my hard drive .
oh , leonard &apos;s been in there for a while ,
but i can stand guard if you wanna use the women &apos;s room .
no , i mean , i was shooting a movie with chang
before he booked ham girl .
i haven &apos;t heard from him since ,
so i assume the footage is useless .
did he sign a release form ?
sure .
i make all my actors sign releases before we do anything .
you never know who is going to .
the school owns a movie starring the ham girl guy .
soon to be spielberg &apos;s ham girl guy .
there &apos;s no way to finish it , though .
abed ?
what have i told you about quitting ?
that it &apos;s sometimes the only way to survive .
well , don &apos;t forget i said sometimes .
yolanda , the mayor &apos;s up my ass .
i want justice .
get him in here !
is that right ?
should i be angry ?
the film &apos;s hero is police justice .
i had a real life former cop help me with the dialogue .
i &apos;m gonna punch you in the heart .
real life former cops aren &apos;t great with dialogue .
i don &apos;t think police should be heroes .
britta , pay your rent .
sorry , abed . okay , i need more information .
what &apos;s my motivation ?
am i married ?
i need more to go on .
can we get lunch ?
okay , cut .
that &apos;s about all we got .
chang found out the mcrib was back
and we lost the rest of the day .
great actor , huge mcrib problem .
everybody .
this is my friend i told you about , maury .
he &apos;s a genuine hollywood film producer whose doctor ordered him
to live in colorado due to a medical condition .
tell them what you told me .
yeah , my blood nitrogen levels are through the roof .
most of the time , i can &apos;t- .
oh , no , no the other thing .
oh , right . if you can cut together
an 81 minute movie that arguably stars
the ham girl guy ,
i can guarantee distribution and a fast turnaround deal .
people do it all the time
with old footage from recently famous actors .
have you seen vin diesel in 1996 &apos;s happy pants ?
no .
well , neither has vin diesel ,
but his roommate from film school saw 500 grand .
but , i can &apos;t just burn up my cop drama .
it &apos;s my only chance at the mainstream success i need
before i &apos;m allowed to make weird stuff for money .
it &apos;s my american graffiti ,
my elephant man , my four rooms ,
the robert rodriguez segment .
well , why does it have to be a police movie ?
people don &apos;t even like police now .
they like dinosaurs , they like aliens
and anything else that chris pratt can join forces with .
i have three minutes of footage and
he &apos;s clearly a police chief behind a desk in new york .
is he ? or is it space york , or is it a dinosaur desk ?
how do i know ?
just add some cg .
that &apos;s what they do with chris pratt .
they put in him a regular scene , and then they add some gagoos .
i have a few cg models of some gagoos .
i got fired from a mouthwash commercial ,
but i successfully won back the rights to my gingivitis monster .
also , i don &apos;t know if it helps ,
but , when i moved into my rv , i found this .
now , that , you notice anything strange ?
there &apos;s no green three in billiards .
now , there &apos;s a green six and a green fourteen ,
but never a green three .
so , what sport is this from ?
and why was it in my rv ?
anyway i , i can do some cg for the movie .
you &apos;ll need a chris pratt type .
i &apos;ll do it if i have to .
i can slouch .
i can &apos;t believe you guys are the ones pitching me this ,
and i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying no .
you &apos;re not saying no .
i mean , legally , i can &apos;t force you .
but , i can do a morning announcement
that will make everyone hate you forever .
technically , abed , you would be robbing the school
for half a million dollars by not making this movie .
but , what movie ?
have you not been listening ?
the movie about the ham girl guy ,
in his space office fighting some gagoos ,
led by chris pratt type ,
played by jeffrey without his shirt .
it shoots this weekend .
yeah .
yeah ?
okay , but i get final cut ,
and it has to be a good movie .
agreed , but you have to finish that cut
by monday , even if it &apos;s bad .
i agree to that , but it has to be good by my standards .
absolutely , and also , if it &apos;s terrible ,
nobody will notice or care .
you guys are all gonna help me ?
and we &apos;re gonna make a good movie ?
definitely , or a bad one .
probably a bad one .
i think we &apos;re all on the same page .
yeah . i guess so .
good .
so , let &apos;s crap out this piece of crap .
that attitude concerns me .
i need more information .
what &apos;s my motivation ?
i need more to go on .
my name is chief starr , and i am in the stars .
and i am the hero .
i deserve better .
you &apos;re a very gifted pilot , chief starr .
i &apos;m the mayor of outer space .
why are we changing course ?
the mayor is up my ass .
father , i love him .
what in the space ?
yooba dooba dooba .
we &apos;re under attack .
by whom , glip glop ?
okay , cut .
why are we cutting ?
that felt good to me .
moving on ? stop .
just a couple of adjustments .
ugh , you get two .
you guys need to move when the ship gets hit .
it looks weird when you stand still .
and britta , it sounds weird when you use good grammar .
my character can &apos;t have good grammar ?
not in a space battle .
because everything else we &apos;re saying sounds really natural ,
like i &apos;m a space senator .
space mayor .
i &apos;m matching your dialogue to what i have from chang .
when are my lines ?
you don &apos;t have any lines .
you &apos;re the backup chang .
but we have chang &apos;s footage .
this shot from that angle matches the back of chang &apos;s shot .
chang is chief starr .
he &apos;s the pilot of the spaceship .
britta , you &apos;re princess meridian .
brittana .
okay . jeff is her father , the mayor of space ,
and you guys are under attack .
action !
what in the space ?
yooba dooba dooba .
we &apos;re under attack .
okay , cut .
where are you guys seeing glip glop ?
that glip glop was a tennis ball .
but , garrett &apos;s not glip glop .
if i was glip glop ,
why would i be holding a tennis ball on a stick ?
why am i wearing a blouse ?
it &apos;s sci @-@ fi , it doesn &apos;t matter .
please don &apos;t say that .
i know you don &apos;t mean that .
the tennis ball is glip glop ,
and please stumble in the same direction .
go ! action . bang .
what in space ?
gooba , gooba , gooba .
we &apos;re under attack !
who by ? who attack ?
me princess .
the sporborfians !
okay , i &apos;m ready .
are you ready ?
are we rolling ?
we &apos;re rolling !
we &apos;re rolling !
get to the escape pod .
really ? you picked that outfit ?
britta ?
it &apos;s meridian .
keep going .
insane .
and , what is your name , exploitia ?
scorpio nine , i &apos;m a pleasure droid .
no , i &apos;m an assassin ?
you &apos;re both , keep going .
she was a pleasure droid .
she got turned into an assassin .
she &apos;s my other daughter .
that &apos;s your sister .
get to the escape pods .
and then , then we go .
this way .
check out chief starr , jeff .
chief starr ?
what ?
i &apos;ll see you in hell .
what ?
mayor , your ass is grass .
okay , cut .
there are some things that we could- .
okay . moving on , people .
okay , moving on .
next shot , space station faculty lounge .
thank you .
abed , we need to move a little faster i think .
can i just explain something as a filmmaker ?
i wish you wouldn &apos;t .
i wish you would look at what i was wearing ,
and let that be all the explanation you need
about where are standards should be .
but , do you understand
that sci @-@ fi films aren &apos;t usually improvised over a weekend
with a cast and crew that doesn &apos;t care ?
we care about finishing .
and , this has to be finished by monday .
so , you &apos;re back into a level of quality from there .
let me use a metaphor i can understand .
every day , i work out .
really ?
yes , because i &apos;m not an artist like you ,
but this is a kind of canvas .
i work on it with equipment , but i will never really be done .
you could be if you wanted , i mean-
this will never be done .
chris pratt &apos;s never gonna stop , is he ?
he &apos;ll always be out there mocking me .
so , i can never stop .
just like you &apos;ll never stop making movies .
but , i don &apos;t stay on one treadmill my entire life ,
staring at commercials for movies with chris pratt .
i take my work into the world .
i premiere it , i share with the public .
don &apos;t stay in the gym , abed .
get this session done , get out there and get your shirt off .
got it ?
yes ?
yes !
ready , let &apos;s do this .
i understand you are looking for your friend .
yeah .
i am minotaur man .
what ?
friends are hard to come by in space .
you &apos;d better take this for protection .
the sound coming from the gun i gave you
is 40,000 hyper watts of laser .
oh , don &apos;t worry , don &apos;t worry about that .
i can put that back .
sometimes my eye falls off because i mean , i &apos;m a robot .
watch out !
how about this baja ,
everyone here is so accustomed to violence .
i need , any no- .
where your friends are ?
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry , but you &apos;re not gonna like this .
your friends have been taken prisoner by master ,
master dracula .
wild west baby .
space version of the wild west .
cut .
okay .
my eye fell off , but , but , but i , i covered it .
perfect . moving on , hallway .
yes !
take that !
this is crazy .
here .
let me do this .
what are you doing ?
you make everything harder for all women when you do that .
i &apos;m improvising .
improvise pockets .
pay your rent , or shut up .
laser bomb !
yooba dooba dooba , glip glop like .
yooba dooba dooba , yooba dooba dooba , yooba dooba dooba .
so the robot also says yooba dooba .
i &apos;m not complaining .
it &apos;s just that everyone who &apos;s not a person
is saying &quot; yooba dooba .. &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because i &apos;m a spy .
he &apos;s a spy .
i &apos;m an evil spy .
shoot glip glop &apos;s he &apos;s a spy .
glop glop &apos;s a spy ?
we went with .
okay shot . shot .
okay now that now that he &apos;s dead
and there &apos;s one robot left
let &apos;s go to the thing .
go .
yooba dooba dooba , yooba dooba dooba , yooba dooba dooba .
space garbage .
look !
we &apos;re gonna get crushed .
and is there a monster ?
but so what ?
we &apos;re gonna get crushed .
i love you ?
i love you .
that &apos;s your daughter .
you &apos;re my daughter .
yeah and you said
we were sisters , dumb ass .
it &apos;s hot .
it &apos;s like chinatown in space .
and i &apos;m the hero ?
yay !
let &apos;s do this .
yeah !
they &apos;re saved !
feel the force .
what ?
i don &apos;t feel the force .
i &apos;m not allowed to .
what do i feel ?
i feel dracula force .
i feel dracula signals .
your ass is mine .
that last stunt you pulled
put six of my best guys in the hospital .
maniac .
i &apos;m more than a maniac .
i &apos;m dracula .
jesus christ , jesus christ ,
oh my god , jesus christ they shot him .
who am i ?
what &apos;s my motivation ?
why am i doing or saying anything that i am saying or doing ,
i need more , i need more than what i &apos;m getting .
that was incredible .
congratulations .
how long is it ?
87 minutes .
get it to eight one , that means 81 .
i &apos;ll make some calls , we &apos;ll premiere this thing ,
and we &apos;ll get your school a check .
so which six minutes should we cut ?
jeff &apos;s death scene probably , right ?
oh . yeah .
mine ?
yeah , in the space dungeon ?
there &apos;s no chang in that .
how long is jeff &apos;s death scene ?
yeah , how long is it . we &apos;re really zeroing in on it .
do you think i &apos;m frightened ?
these chains were forged from the iron of ganymede .
and the steel ,
i &apos;m not going to tell you where he is .
i &apos;d rather die .
hm , it seems pretty important
he doesnt give doesn &apos;t give up chang .
i mean , otherwise the last thing he says to him is ,
i &apos;ll see you in hell .
it &apos;s not really a movie about him .
yeah . hm @-@ hm . well , what about your steel drum solo ?
oh , i don &apos;t think we should lose that .
well , what about the weird wedding ritual
on glip glop &apos;s planet , huh ?
okay .
let &apos;s not throw out the baby with the bath water .
we &apos;re not getting a frame of glip glop .
i mean , that &apos;s like cutting cowboy out of midnight cowboy .
jeff &apos;s death scene is six minutes 30 seconds .
there you go .
oh , there you go .
okay , cool . easy enough .
should we , before we finish editing ,
should we get those hornets out of the garbage ?
those swarming hornets .
is that serious ?
is he doing a bit
that &apos;s a long bit .
oh , he &apos;s serious .
let &apos;s face it .
it &apos;s pretty obvious when he &apos;s acting .
let &apos;s do this .
yo , yo , yo . howdy .
welcome to kyle beiderman &apos;s editing tutorials .
i &apos;m kyle beiderman .
yeah , that kyle beiderman .
leave me alone , abed .
once i &apos;ve watched this tutorial on how editing works ,
i &apos;m gonna save this movie without removing its soul .
step one .
how to correctly label your files .
nobody cares about labeling files , teach me to edit .
what the hell was that ?
you stay away !
this is my movie too !
it &apos;s not even a movie jeff , it &apos;s a piece of crap .
that doesn &apos;t mean it can &apos;t be good .
that &apos;s basically exactly what it means .
you stay away abed .
i &apos;m not kidding .
i &apos;m huge and i have zero blood sugar .
i will kill you in these frisbees and nobody will ever find you .
okay .
so now let &apos;s get familiar with the user interface .
no , just teach me to edit .
bazinga .
i &apos;m going to kill you .
you &apos;re killing me !
i told you !
you &apos;re literally killing me .
for real ?
yes !
are you nuts ?
what is wrong with you ?
every single one of you was gonna leave here except for me .
troy , shirley , annie &apos;s gonna be president .
even pierce got to die .
and chang goes to hollywood .
so , we force you to make the crappiest movie of all time ,
and then we force you to make it even crappier .
and we watch it , and it &apos;s still not even that bad .
and the part i accidentally got the most excited about
is the seven minutes we can cut .
do you know what that means ?
it means i &apos;m a genius , but we already knew that .
i finally know in my heart ,
that i will literally be the last one of us here .
and i know , they gave digital muscles
to chris pratt in guardians of the galaxy .
i watch parks and rec .
i watched it . there &apos;s no scientific explanation for .
hm , jeff .
you helped me learn something about film making today
that i think we all need to apply to life .
it &apos;s okay to plan some stuff ,
and it &apos;s okay to figure out what we did wrong .
but our plans are randomly gonna fall apart
and our lessons are randomly gonna be wrong ,
and if we just keep the cameras rolling
and shoot a lot of crap eventually
annie is going to reach down her shirt and pull out a laser bomb .
i didn &apos;t write that , we didn &apos;t plan that .
god made that happen .
god made this movie , and it &apos;s dumb .
and we &apos;re dumb for being in it .
life is a big , dumb , pointless movie with no story
and an abrupt ending where the hero gets shot by dracula
in the middle of a lunch order during an outtake .
but somewhere in there , every once in a while .
annie reaches down her shirt .
so we keep the cameras rolling ,
and we edit out the parts we don &apos;t like ,
and we stop thinking about chris pratt so much ,
because it is not healthy .
will you do me a favor ?
i never tell anybody about our private conversations .
i wouldn &apos;t really know how .
let &apos;s cut my stupid scene out of this piece of crap .
then what we need to add 30 seconds ?
i have an idea about that .
who am i ?
what &apos;s my motivation ?
why am i doing or saying anything , i &apos;m saying or doing ?
but , am i married ?
i need more .
i need more than what i &apos;m getting .
hello chief star .
i told you i &apos;d see you in hell .
and look who else is here .
yooba dooba dooba .
oh , great job you guys , on the new ending .
i like that the guy actually saw him in hell .
right ?
hold on , phone call
from the distributor
get ready for a big check .
yellow .
wait . calm down .
what &apos;s chapter 11 ?
wait . what &apos;s youtube ?
wait . what &apos;s broadband ?
what &apos;s digital ?
i don &apos;t have a good feeling about that call .
i don &apos;t have a good feeling about chang staying bankable .
did you guys see this news story ?
i &apos;ll never look at hot air ballooning the same way again .
lord james franco &apos;s balls .
oh , no .
i tell you what i do have a good feeling about .
bring it in .
come on guys .
yeah .
all right , one more for safety ben .
what do you mean , one more for safety ?
i , i just don &apos;t know if we get the line ,
hold on slinky .
let &apos;s move on .
i , i think , can , can we get one more ?
you got it ! come on ! hold on , slinky !
let &apos;s go .
i think it was fine , but steven &apos;s kind of a stickler .
tell steven spielberg to lick my butt .
well , he &apos;s right here , so .
hey , steven spielberg .
can you give us a sec ?
yes .
ben ?
yep .
so , i guess we &apos;re good for today .
great job , you were right . we got everything we need .
and there &apos;s a small door in the back , back of the booth there ,
that will take you , you know , outside .
and , we &apos;ll talk soon .
i don &apos;t go the way i came ?
you do not .
there is a little door back there , and it goes right on out .
thank you so much .
okay .
okay .
okay , randall , are you ready ?
yup .
which brings us to the issue of our cosmetology department ,
who once again , find themselves .
who , once again , find themselves nearing the end of
the semester without any free haircut volunteers .
that may be due to last semesters lice scare .
totally .
yep .
maybe if we put up a sign , guaranteed no lice .
something like that .
that would open you up to lawsuits .
son , we live in a world that has walls ,
and those walls have to be guarded by men with hair clippers .
pink floyd .
you &apos;re the worst .
what ?
oh , she is the worst .
terrible .
i can &apos;t believe she said that .
terrible .
name one movie .
britta &apos;s the worst !
did you get any of that ?
