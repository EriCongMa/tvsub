i tried to take the high road .
apparently , the high road is paved with restraining orders .
the restraining order was a mistake .
you were my best friend , april .
and we should treat each other the way we did on this paper .
bailey gave me the preminger grant .
i &apos;m gonna be miserable without you .
you can figure it out . you will . you -- you should .
i can totally go with her .
you &apos;ll be able to see sofia whenever you want .
my ex @-@ wife wants to move

it &apos;s good .
penny and i found a place near preminger .
it &apos;s really nice .
an apartment ?
yeah .
is it small ?
it has two bedrooms ,
and it &apos;s really close to some really great schools .
you picked schools ?
no , i brought these so that we could decide ,
so that we could talk about the possibilities .
you picked brochures . it sounds like you &apos;re decided .
she &apos;s going to school in new york ?
i mean , if she does ,
she would need to fill out an application ,
which , actually , i meant to talk to -- - okay . i &apos;m sorry .
we need to take , a big step backwards .
somewhere , sometime you heard me say yes to this .
you heard me say , &quot; yes , please , callie ,
take my daughter across the country . &quot;
but i never said that .
i did not . i said we could talk about it .
no . callie , what you said was ,
&quot; you &apos;ll be able to see sofia whenever you want . &quot;
okay , that &apos;s not what i meant .
i &apos;ll &quot; be able &quot; to see her .
i was just excited about making this move . that &apos;s all .
go . be happy .
have your penny .
you &apos;re ju-- you &apos;re not taking my daughter with you .
please stop saying your daughter .
she &apos;s -- but she is my daughter ,
and she &apos;s yours , and she lives here .
so i don &apos;t know why we &apos;re talking about schools over there
and bedrooms and ...
i -- why can &apos;t she come visit you ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s not ...
okay . that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
that -- that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
that -- we are just discussing what the options are .
that &apos;s not what it sounds like .
how &apos;s hot rock star ?
filthy as ever .
and creative .
i know , right ?
i &apos;ve got to keep coming up with new names for his ...
oh , no .
what &apos;s wrong ?
kyle is in town , and he wants to take me out to dinner .
i don &apos;t understand your face .
no . no , i &apos;m not going .
why not ? free food with bonus hot guy ?
we &apos;re doing very well right now with our fingers ,
so why screw with it ?
you mean by actually screwing .
this is fun ,
but we don &apos;t actually have anything in common .
you know , do surgeons even date musicians ?
he is very chatty .
no , this is grey . she wants labs back on her ...
no . no .

james is coming today .
that &apos;s great .
james ?
my boyfriend .
sort of . i mean , &quot; soul mate &quot; is gross ,
but , yes , my boyfriend .
i &apos;m finally meeting him today , and i look like this .
you haven &apos;t met your boyfriend ?
not in person .
they met online .
a year ago . and it &apos;s been the most amazing year .
only over texts .
then i told him about my surgery ,
and he said he had to be here -- canceled everything .
that &apos;s really sweet .
i know it sounds crazy .
you can get a lot done in a text .
what am i doing ?
i mean , why would i want him to meet me like that ?
he &apos;s going to be expecting my profile pic ,
and i don &apos;t really even look that good on my best day .
you look fine .
and dr. edwards completely understands .
she has a first date today , too . a big one .
huge , apparently .
really ? that &apos;s so nice .
no . it &apos;s still up in the air .
we will be back to prep you for surgery . okay ?
let &apos;s go , edwards .
apparently , you got my text .
oh , yeah . i got it good .
obviously it was not meant for you .
i hope not , because it sounds so painful .
it was very unprofessional ,
and i should have been more careful .
edwards , you really should save your energy ,
because you &apos;re gonna need it .
can we skip ahead to the part where this joke is old ?
no . did you really do this ?
i have ... not .
i &apos;ve -- i &apos;ve -- i was riffing on ...
you -- okay .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m confused . your son is here ?

we were at work , and -- and our sons are at -- at home with the sitter .
the last names are green and cole . can you just look it up ?
i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m sorry .

and we &apos;ll get back to you when we know something .
oh , please , let them both be alive .
come with me .
come with me . come with me .
guys , i appreciate that you want to help ,

pierce .
we &apos;re good , thanks .
sofia &apos;s doing really well .
you know , she loves her dance class ,
and why would we take her out of school in the middle of the year ?
no , no , no . no , no , no .
we wouldn &apos;t move her until after school &apos;s over for the year .
well , yeah , no . &quot; we &quot; wouldn &apos;t move her anywhere .
uh , &quot; we &quot; is you and penny .
you can &apos;t do this . you don &apos;t get to just decide to --
i haven &apos;t decided anything . i &apos;m trying to talk to you .
i &apos;m trying to show you that i &apos;ve thought out this choice .
but it &apos;s not just your choice .
to completely disrupt our child &apos;s life --
why is it disrupting her life ?
you moved three times a year when you were a kid .
you turned out pretty good . why isn &apos;t it just life ?
i have a consult .
do you want to look at these ?
no . no , i &apos;m good .
he &apos;s so little .
he &apos;s so little .
hey , you still have that , uh , prenatal appointment tomorrow ?

absolutely . uh , right after .
all right . appreciate it .
of course .
brandon &apos;s injuries are severe .
and we &apos;re taking him up to surgery right now .
the bullet hit his spinal cord ,
so at the moment we are evaluating --
patty .
stacy , are you okay ?
were you shot at ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
i left the room for just a few minutes .
were the boys out front ?
did they find the person who did it ?
no . the boys found your gun .
they were playing with it .

peter , brandon &apos;s alive , okay ?
and we &apos;re gonna take care of him right now .
all right ?
i &apos;m gonna need to talk to you .

we told that kid that he didn &apos;t kill his friend .
he didn &apos;t .
except we don &apos;t know that . not yet .
you all right ?
yeah , i just -- i needed a second .
a little kid got shot .
oh , god .
yeah . it &apos;s just awful .
okay .
time &apos;s up . yeah .
how did everything go with arizona ?
she &apos;s not even open to talking .
it &apos;s like she &apos;s just saying no .
i &apos;m sorry . that sucks .
did i jump the gun here ?
i &apos;m just trying to get all the ducks in a row
so that we can talk ,
but it seems like she really just wants to fight about this .
am i wrong ?
yeah , i @-@ i can &apos;t help you .
there may come a time when i get to have a say in sofia &apos;s life ,
but that &apos;s definitely not now .
i &apos;d just make things worse .
so , all i can say is i &apos;m sorry .
that sucks .
coags and lfts are normal .
she &apos;s ready when the o.r. &apos; s ready .
great . how are you feeling ?
sheila , what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . he just texted me .
he &apos;s here in the hospital , and he brought irises .
he remembered i loved irises .
it &apos;s just -- i was just freaking out .
okay , well , let &apos;s try to calm down .
sheila davis ?
yes . is he here ?
um ... yeah .
hi .
what ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m james .
surprise .
no .
i @-@ i @-@ i know this isn &apos;t what you &apos;re expecting .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m really , really sorry about that ,
but i just -- - oh , my god .
this isn &apos;t how i wanted to do this at all , but when you --
when you told me you were sick and you needed surgery ,
i just couldn &apos;t wait .
you catfished her .
no , i @-@ i just didn &apos;t want to --
get out . get out .
sheila , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s james .
get out ! get out !
we should call security .
james , let &apos;s go .
james .
get out !
i think we should go outside . - oh . oh . i just --
l1 shattered and left fragments in the spinal canal .
so , his mom just had a gun laying around .
she said she had it locked up .
the mom should be locked up .
well , she might be .
it could be involuntary manslaughter if --
don &apos;t even say it . it &apos;s not gonna happen .
do you own a gun ?
no . no .
no , i , uh , fix bullet holes . i don &apos;t make them .
i just mean you &apos;re in the army . i imagine --
well , you need one in the army . you don &apos;t need one here .
well , every day ,
someone &apos;s kid is in an o.r. with a gunshot wound .
every single day .
when are people gonna learn ?
it just makes things worse .
and people always say they need one for protection .
they don &apos;t .
unless they do .
i have a gun .
yeah , right .
i do . i &apos;ve had one for a long time .
you have a gun .
why ?
just like you said -- for protection .
have you used it ?
no . i haven &apos;t needed to , thank god .
thank god you haven &apos;t had it used against you .
all right . can we stop ?
there &apos;s a kid down there scared to death
he might have killed his friend .
there are two lives on this table right now ,
so can we just stop the chatter and pay attention ?
right angle .
what happened ?
sorry ? - ‭ well , how did you --
where were you that they were able to get a gun ?
i was --
i left the room for a minute .
for a minute ?
it was so fast .
so , but why ? why ?
what ?
did you leave your phone charger in the car or ...
were you texting or was it the tv ?
no ! the police already asked me all this .
yeah , why were you gone long enough
for them to unlock a drawer or a closet or whatever
and pull out a gun and shoot it ?
it was your job to keep them safe .
it was literally your job .
and i was doing my job .
the boys aren &apos;t babies . they &apos;re 8 .
they go off and they play together .
i don &apos;t have to watch over them every single second .
they &apos;re good boys .
i @-@ i should be able to go to the bathroom
or warm them up some mac and cheese
without them shooting each other .
dr. pierce .
‭ i was just making them food !
this wasn &apos;t my fault !
can i get you to take a look at something , please ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
did they call someone for you ?
is your mom coming ?
uh , dr. pierce .
i spent every day for an entire year talking to him ,
and he &apos;s just ... a liar .
of course , i &apos;m the idiot who let it happen .
i mean , i told him that i loved him before we even met .
who the hell does that ?
well , you were ready for something good .
yeah , plus , sometimes
someone can seem really , really good onscreen .
true .
sometimes too good .
he was so good onscreen .
i know .
oh , my god . oh , go-- no , no , no .
what -- - what is he doing here ?
wait . that &apos;s your date ?
that &apos;s the guy you were gonna do the --
please don &apos;t .
i mean , i wouldn &apos;t .
i &apos;m classy , remember ?
hi . what are you --
uh , i &apos;m working .
i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll walk with you .
i &apos;m , uh , kyle diaz .
hi , kyle . i feel like i know you .
what are you doing here ?
you said you couldn &apos;t wait to see me .
i said a lot of things .
she did .
this is my life .
i get james and you get that .
you really need to leave . i &apos;m working .
you know , edwards , you can go and
catch up if you need to .
see ? we get to catch up .
no , we really -- i don &apos;t need to catch up .
uh , you really need to leave because i need to go operate .
can i watch ?
see you do your thing ?
no .
no ?
no , it &apos;s private , okay ?
the o.r. is a private place , and you can &apos;t watch .
i &apos;m working ! this is an o.r. elevator .
you can &apos;t go in here , either . the o.r. is a sterile area .
you are not sterile .
you are ... very , very dirty .
robbins .
i &apos;ve been working on the resident rotation schedule .
okay .
yeah , and losing warren and blake --
i mean , soon enough , it &apos;s gonna have an impact .
yeah .
would you care if you lost a resident for a few days
while i get things settled ?
no .
i &apos;ll give you two interns .
no ! no ! why is it just me ?
why are you taking my resident away ?
why am i the one that &apos;s just gonna roll over and take it ?
and why don &apos;t you go screw someone else over ?
robbins , you might want to take it down a notch .
callie &apos;s moving to new york .
what ?
and she &apos;s trying to take sofia with her .
can she do that ?
hey . what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m doing it .
you &apos;re doing what ?
something other than literally --
literally watching the clothes dry at my house .
slow down .
i &apos;m meeting with don heller .
seriously ?
yes . yes . look ,
i have seven years in anesthesiology .
it &apos;s perfect . i can work ,
help people , earn money ,
and get time in the o.r.
everybody wins .
all right . what does -- what does bailey think about this ?
well , listen , it might not even pan out .
right . i mean , why tell her
until it &apos;s a real thing ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
just keep it to ourselves .
until we know .
you realize that &apos;s a terrible idea , right ?
it &apos;s a great idea .
i wish you luck , sir .
it &apos;s a great idea .
i don &apos;t see any residual bleeding .
can you get a good look ?
yeah .
definite csf leak .
we &apos;ll need to remove the entire vertebral body
to decompress the spinal cord , right ?
problem is , i &apos;ll need to dissect more of the aorta .
risking paralysis ? is there another option ?
put him in a brace .
then he wouldn &apos;t be completely decompressed .
so , we risk paralyzing him either way .
what are you gonna do ?
do i have time to talk to his mom ?
both the brace and the surgery carry some risk of paralysis .
my recommendation is the surgery .
it &apos;s very delicate , but i would like to try it .
my husband &apos;s on his way . do i have to decide right now ?
i &apos;m afraid we can &apos;t wait .
okay . okay . um , then please do whatever you can .
but he &apos;ll survive , either way , right ?
danielle .
we &apos;re working very hard .
he &apos;ll pull through . i know he will .
danielle , will you shut up ? !
what ?
you better hope he pulls through .
this is not peter &apos;s fault . he is a child .
but the gun was locked away .
they shouldn &apos;t have been in my room .
‭ this is not the time --
oh , don &apos;t you dare get righteous with me .
that was your house and your gun
and your kid that knew about it , not mine .
i sent my child over to your house to play ,
and your kid might have made him a murderer .
i called the sitter . the kids are okay .
what &apos;s wrong ? what happened ?
nothing . nothing .
i just wanted to make sure they &apos;re okay , and they are .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
oh . okay , you guys haven &apos;t heard .
an 8 @-@ year @-@ old came in today ,
gsw , accidentally shot by his friend .
anyway , just wanted to check in , you know ?
okay .
man , i just ... kids with guns .
stop that .
we &apos;re not doing this . it &apos;s too sad .
shake it off . we can be sad later .
we &apos;re talking juvie gsw during my surgery .
richard , she offered me visitation rights
to see my own daughter .
well , i @-@ i &apos;m sure she didn &apos;t mean it that way , arizona .
how else would she mean it ?
my lawyer says it &apos;s an indication that --
your lawyer ?
yes , i have to protect myself .
i know you feel like you do .
but you and torres
have always figured out this stuff beautifully .
just slow down .
i just watched jackson and april --
yeah , i know . so did i. it was a mess .
a mess started
with overreactions and misunderstandings .
so , what ? now i &apos;m overreacting ?
i &apos;m saying sofia &apos;s too important not to
ask yourself if you are
before you do something that can &apos;t be undone .
you &apos;re right . of course .
you &apos;re right . i know .
retract more cephalad .
great .
so , what &apos;s your deal ?
i &apos;ll establish vascular control , and --
no , i meant about your date ,
the one you blew off out there .
there is no deal . what &apos;s your deal ?
excuse me .
you &apos;re not supposed to tell me
to take my time to go see a guy .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me to hurry up and prep .
can you please do your job and make my life miserable ?
i &apos;m just saying , after all those texts ,
and then that &apos;s the way you treat him ?
&apos;cause the texts are all it is .
yeah , it &apos;s been a few weeks ,
and it &apos;s good and hot , but ...
i know . it &apos;s on my phone .
the expectations are too high .
there can only be disappointment from here .
you don &apos;t know that .
i know i am a very good &quot; on paper &quot; person .
i mean , i shine . i &apos;m amazing .
but when it comes to being an &quot; in person &quot; person , i ...
you said you wanted to work and not talk ,
so can we focus on the work , please ?
i said i didn &apos;t want to talk about sad stuff .
i &apos;m okay to talk about this stuff .
graspers .
although , this is its own kind of sad .
hell . i &apos;m in actual hell right now .
well , you said to make you miserable .
dr. shepherd , bp is going down .
how &apos;s that bone graft coming ?
it &apos;s out . sealing up with bone wax .
it &apos;s in the house ?
what ?
the gun . where is it in the house ?
it &apos;s in a safe place .
i didn &apos;t even know it was there . i want to know where it is .
it &apos;s in a box under the bed .
it &apos;s under our bed ? !
that &apos;s where we &apos;d need it .
i don &apos;t want a gun in my house .
it &apos;s my house , too . it makes me feel safer .
does it ?
have you seen our neighborhood ?
because you &apos;re not safer . you &apos;re more likely to get hurt
because of a freakin &apos; gun around .
alex .
i got shot once . you know that .
bp &apos;s 60 over 40 . starting him on levo .
once i decompress the spinal cord ,
it should get better .
i just -- just let me work . - work faster .
you okay ?
yeah . just watching .
he &apos;s hypotensive now .
you &apos;d make a good cop .
you nearly broke that babysitter .
‭ i don &apos;t know what i was doing .
why did i do that ?
i watch my sister &apos;s kids all the time .
and last week , i turned away for one second ,
and my nephew had dumped an entire bag of flour
on the kitchen floor .
he &apos;s 3 .
and i thought ,
&quot; what if that had been a pot of boiling water ? &quot;
i &apos;m not used to this --
being scared like this , worrying like this .
they &apos;re not even my kids .
oh , i get it .
they &apos;re family .
family messes you up .
that part &apos;s new for me .
got a minute ?
ben . what are you --
i just came by to , uh --
you know , i @-@ i had a nice conversation
with don heller just now .
you did ?
yeah . i thought i could
pick up some cases as an anesthesiologist ,
and he said he &apos;d be happy to have me --
no , absolutely not .
i said , &quot; great . when can i start ? &quot;
ben , no .
i can &apos;t sit around that house for five more months , miranda .
you &apos;re suspended .
sitting around is the damn point .
i am suspended from the surgical residency program .
i won &apos;t be operating .
and i can stay current in the o.r.
i can earn a living .
nobody &apos;s gonna go hungry .
look , what &apos;s it gonna look like if the staff sees you
sitting in surgery like nothing happened ?
it &apos;s gonna look like i &apos;m working .
it &apos;ll make me look like i &apos;m -- - you ? you ?
see , it &apos;s always about your job ,
what &apos;s gonna make you look good or bad .
well , what am i supposed to do ?
i don &apos;t know , but you &apos;re not doing this .
you run surgery , not anesthesia .
you &apos;re not chief there .
it &apos;s not your department . it &apos;s not your call .
ben . you can do this .
oh , i know i can .
but if you do ,
you better figure out where you &apos;re gonna sleep .
how you doing ?
micro penfield 4 . just a few more --
he &apos;s in v @-@ tach , rate of 233 .
paddles !
no , no paddles .
his spine is completely unstable and exposed right now .
we have to .
if you shock him ,
he will move and he will be paralyzed .
you &apos;ll undo all my work .
we &apos;ll try and take him down with meds .
push amiodarone , 125 milligrams .
just give me a minute .
add vaso on top of his pressors .
v @-@ fib .
shepherd , we have to shock him .
charge to 50 .
no ! if he moves , he won &apos;t walk .
if he dies , he won &apos;t walk , either .
clear .
amelia , clear !
just give me -- damn it !
clear .
is sheila okay ?
james , sheila was very clear . she wants you to leave .
i love her . i wasn &apos;t trying to lie .
should i call security ?
we talked online every day .
we understand each other in a way that --
i &apos;ve never been seen like that or loved like that --
for who i am .
well , not exactly who you are .
yes . who i am , not just what i look like .
so , when she asked to see my picture ,
i @-@ i looked at myself in the mirror and ...
i got scared .
i knew this could happen . i &apos;m not stupid .
but then , when she was dying , i had to risk it .
well , she wasn &apos;t dying .
her tumor , i mean .
it was a benign tumor .
the chances of it killing her were very , very low .
excuse me ?
yeah .
you told me you were dying !
get out .
you said you had a malignant tumor .
you said you were 6 &apos; 2 . &quot;
how could you lie straight to my face ?
it wasn &apos;t even your face , you liar .
you said you were dying !
you said you had hair !
yeah , i can &apos;t believe i &apos;d fall for someone as superficial as you !
a person does not get to call me superficial ...
uh , are you calling security or am i ?
i will , and i will handle sheila &apos;s post @-@ op .
you &apos;re done here .
pardon me ?
edwards , go . bite the bullet . go on the date .
it &apos;s better than being lonely and crazy like me
or having sex with your phone in the residents &apos; lounge .
can you not --
go . and don &apos;t text me from it .
you owe me a year of my life back !
god , i told you i loved you .
stop yelling at me . so , you do love me .
no , no . i loved a stranger !
security .
what is it , torres ?
no , uh -- we had a meeting scheduled for now ,
but you &apos;re busy .
what &apos;s it about ? - um , it can wait .
not gonna get any less busy , torres .
just tell me . - i &apos;d rather --
i &apos;d rather wait .
what is it ?
i &apos;m moving to new york with penny blake .
i &apos;m leaving grey @-@ sloan .
uh , excuse us , please .
mm @-@ hmm . sure .
when ?
well , penny starts work in a couple of months ,
so first i need to get some things squared away .
like a job ?
uh , i already have an offer from nyu ,
and columbia &apos;s been calling ,
so there &apos;s been a couple of other --
they offered you chief of ortho ?
no . um , it &apos;ll be fewer hours .
and penny &apos;s working a lot , so ...
and i &apos;m hoping to have sofia there .
what ?
i mean , your career --
you &apos;re a chief . she &apos;s a resident .
so , you &apos;re giving up your career
to chase tail across the country ?
i just wanted to give you notice .
and i don &apos;t need your judgment .
arizona &apos;s already got that covered .
hey . start her on d5 half .
i &apos;ll be back in about a half an hour .
uh @-@ huh . okay .
hi . this is dr. robbins .
i &apos;m sorry . from where ?
yes , i am .
yeah , you bet i have a minute .
there &apos;s a chance of some recovery of movement ,
but it &apos;s very small .
he &apos;ll get physical and occupational therapy
to help him regain some function ,
find some new ways --
but he &apos;ll never walk again ?
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s very unlikely .
the gun was locked up .
it was supposed to be locked in a drawer . it was .
i don &apos;t know how they -- - kids watch .
they pick up everything you do .
i &apos;m very sorry that this happened .
brandon didn &apos;t die ?
no . he didn &apos;t .
but he can &apos;t walk ?
and he can &apos;t ride bikes ?
is he mad at me ?
if it had been brandon who hurt you ,
would you be mad at him ?
a little . but it was just an accident .
right .
so , i want you to promise me something .
whenever you feel bad about this ,
i want you to say ,
&quot; it was an accident .
i didn &apos;t mean to . &quot;
i know that .
but you have to know it , too .
so , you got to promise me you will say ,
&quot; i didn &apos;t mean to . &quot;
we can go now , right ? we &apos;re free to go ?
will you promise me that ?
peter , honey , it &apos;s time to go .
thank you .
well , brandon &apos;s doing fine . his bp &apos;s ...
i lived in my car when i was 16 years old .
every night , trying to fall asleep ,
i would listen to the voices --
people going by ,
people who had nothing going on ,
nothing going for them , nothing to lose ,
scared to death that they would break in and take my stuff ,
take me .
this gun made me feel like
i had something ,
something on them .
but then , today ...
that little boy will never walk again .
jo , he &apos;s still alive .
barely .
you know , back then , i ...
i didn &apos;t value my life all that much ,
but
it &apos;s different now .
i &apos;ve outgrown this .
i don &apos;t need it anymore .
i don &apos;t want it .
i thought we were getting drinks .
your exact words were &quot; somewhere special . &quot;
come on .
this is , uh -- this is the holy ground .
also the dirty ground with the dirty rugs and --
have they ever cleaned any of these ?
no , they &apos;ll never change anything in here --
the paint or the rugs .
they don &apos;t -- they don &apos;t really want to mess with the --
with the acoustics , you know , or the , uh -- or the mojo .
every major musician from seattle has recorded here .
and now me .
all i wanted was just to record here ,
right here , this -- this very room .
you know , this is --
this is where i @-@ i feel the most like myself .
this is the me that i like the most .
yeah , i get that . i get that .
the o.r. &apos; s kind of that way for me .
you know , the feel of the scrub brush ,
the smell of the antiseptic -- it &apos;s just --
the air changes when you walk in .
it gets cold .
you can feel your mind sharpen as you step up to the table .
yeah , it &apos;s like -- like you turn it up a notch .
or a bunch of notches .
like you get charged .
yeah , right .
okay .
i like it .
okay .
thank you . thank you .
come on .
what is this ? what is this ? &quot; come on ? &quot;
aren &apos;t you gonna play something for me ?
oh , you want me to play for you ?
isn &apos;t that your move ?
don &apos;t you play for all the girls ?
hey , it &apos;s my life .
you know , when i &apos;m playing ,
it &apos;s how i let someone in , let someone see , uh --
okay , it &apos;s my move , right ?
yeah .
it &apos;s my move .
but , uh , it always works , though .
yeah , i bet .
you want me to play for you ?
kyle , you don &apos;t need moves .
okay . i &apos;m ready . let &apos;s go .
i just want to go see the kids .
i did something very good today .
i pushed two hearts together .
i forwarded the course of love .
‭ what &apos;s wrong ? what &apos;s wrong ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know how you do it , mer .
do what ?
love your kids like this .
i really love them .
they love you , too .
no , i love them like --
if something happened to them , i would die .
like , my heart is so wide open , and they &apos;re so fragile .
i don &apos;t know how you live like this .
i don &apos;t .
it &apos;s awful .
sometimes , you just have to push through it ,
push the awful aside , just get through the day .
i think you saved that boy today .
i paralyzed that boy today .
i was too slow .
no , i meant peter .
nathan ...
nathan cheated on my sister .
i know .
i , uh -- i ...
and when she found out , she called .
she told me .
and i said --
i said ...
&quot; just forget about him .
walk away .
just get on a chopper and come to me . &quot;
i told my sister to get on that helicopter .
i did it .
that was the last thing i ever said to her .
you didn &apos;t mean to .
got a late one , huh ?
i do . everything okay ?
i wondered if you wanted to go in the morning to the ob .
o @-@ of course i do . yeah .
good .
baby should know that you &apos;re there .
i will be there .
9 : 00 a.m. ?
sure .
hey , there he is . glad to see you , man .
glad it all worked out .
yep . yep , it worked out .
once we fire that first shot , we &apos;re committed .
god , she was so little .
you remember when sofia was in here
and you could see her heartbeat in her whole body ?
god , how impossibly tiny she was .
i can &apos;t believe our girl was ever that little .
there &apos;s almost no way to take it back .
i jumped the gun . i &apos;m so sorry .
i was carried away when i first told you .
and i &apos;ve done everything wrong since .
sofia is our little girl ,
and i am not trying to make plans without you .
please believe that .
the barton school called me .
they wanted to talk to me about her application ,
which they loved .
they called you ?
so , tell me that part again
about how you &apos;re not making plans ?
you know how these things work . there are waiting lists .
it doesn &apos;t mean that i actually tried to make --
we &apos;re not talking about this anymore .
hey , you don &apos;t get to decide that . i &apos;m going .
i don &apos;t want to leave sofia behind ,
so we have to work out something .
yeah , i just mean that you &apos;re not talking to me about it anymore .
the question becomes --
do we keep firing back ...
you got a lawyer ?
yeah . you can talk to her .
you hired a lawyer .
yes .
now who &apos;s jumping the gun ?
you started this .
all right .
... and declare an all @-@ out war ?
