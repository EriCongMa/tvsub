earl , i noticed you &apos;re still alive .
what &apos;s your secret ?
well , it &apos;s my positive attitude ,
a little bit of genetics ,
and knowing how to take care of your body .
i use jojoba .
what is that , like a lotion ?
no , it &apos;s a ho named joba .
she comes over once a week .
max , you just got box delivered at home .
i don &apos;t want another box .
i got my hands full with this one .
i used to have so many packages delivered to my house ,
my dad had to buy fedex just to save money .
i remember a time before mail .
you just didn &apos;t get stuff .
nope . i don &apos;t want that .
it &apos;s a delivery from my mother .
the last thing she delivered was me ,
and i &apos;m still cleaning up that mess .
aren &apos;t you at least curious what she sent ?
unless it &apos;s a brand new childhood ,
i &apos;m not interested .
here , earl , hold max &apos;s box .
but she &apos;s like a daughter to me .
look , caroline , i brought in my fish tank ,
which max has been calling my olympic @-@ size swimming pool .
see , han ? the world &apos;s different above sea @-@ level .
now , come over here and say hello .
i &apos;m saying hello to fish now ?
that &apos;s where i &apos;m at ?
you too , max .
i want my diner family to meet my fish family .
i got an aunt that drinks like a fish .
maybe she &apos;s in there .
oh , no , she &apos;s in jail for vehicular manslaughter .
please enjoy my ecosystem of love .
never tap on the glass !
just look at that meaty paw of yours .
it &apos;s like an earthquake to them .
oh , there &apos;s my prize .
the royal blue tang fish .
$ 500 .
han , i &apos;m not surprised you have to pay for blue tang ,
but $ 500 seems high .
hey han , jojoba &apos;ll do it for 25 .
well , i hope your fish will be very happy here .
i mean , no one else is , but who knows .
let &apos;s go , max .
did oleg take liam neeson &apos;s daughter ?
女儿被人口贩子绑架
i &apos;m breaking up with all my ladies
so i can start up again with sophie .
and oksana &apos;s not taking it lying down ,
or bent over like she usually is .
well , i &apos;m sorry i never got to meet her .
just tell her that you and sophie have decided to be--
what &apos;s the ukrainian word for &quot; monogamy &quot; ?
there isn &apos;t one .
you &apos;re either ugly or you &apos;re sleeping with everyone .
uh @-@ uh . no way .
leave it out here .
let the bomb @-@ squad figure it out .
don &apos;t you wanna know what she sent you ?
maybe there &apos;s money in there .
so you &apos;re just gonna leave it out in the hall
like a room service tray ?
oh , my god , i used to have room service .
oh , my god , i used to have a room .
well , i don &apos;t want it in the apartment .
this is a place of positive energy and good vibes .
i &apos;m sending it back to her tomorrow .
i will go to my shallow , unmarked grave
not knowing what &apos;s in that box .
hey , max , you got a box out here ,
and there &apos;s a bear in it !
oh , my god .
she kept that ?
how did my mom ever keep that ?
she can &apos;t even keep her teeth .
that &apos;s what was in the box ?
a teddy ruxpin doll ?
are you registered at mustybears.com ?
not a doll and not his name .
i had it legally changed to t @-@ rux .
i used the same lawyer my mom hired
to declare me native american
so she didn &apos;t have to pay for parking at the casino .
里面都盖有赌场来吸引游客
for six months , i had to answer the phone ,
&quot; max proudfoot . &quot;
you know , in poland , we didn &apos;t have dolls .
yeah , we just hired little gypsy kids
历史上多从事占卜 歌舞 乞丐 扒手 人贩子
and we carried them around .
yeah , mine was called gurgio .
yeah , and i think uh , he had a little bit of polio .
hey , didn &apos;t those things talk ?
they did if you had four c batteries .
wait , i think i have some .
yup , they came with this adorable teddy bear singing cassette ,
so of course , i smashed that with a rock
and made my own .
yeah , my gurgio didn &apos;t talk .
i &apos;m not sure he had a tongue .
but he used to squeeze me really tight .
and then i found out later , he was 35 .
you had four c batteries in your nightstand ?
from what ?
do you wanna hear the bear talk or don &apos;t you ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry , girls .
i gotta take this .
it &apos;s another guy that i &apos;m breaking it off with .
i sure hope oleg &apos;s worth it .
i just dumped a guy with multiple personalities .
yeah , and he took it okay ,
and not great ,
and pretty bad .
there &apos;s no note or anything .
this box is really just a well of disappointment .
why would your mother send you this ?
why would she do anything ?
why would she bite our dog ?
why would she make out with our jack o &apos;lantern ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , max , she did send you your favorite toy
after all these years .
maybe she &apos;s trying to make amends .
oh , make amends ?
she couldn &apos;t even make me a sandwich .
okay , you ready ?
i know you are , but what am i ?
oh , my god . max , is that you ?
is that your little max voice ?
careful , i &apos;m about to open up a can of whoop ass .
it is you ! how old were you there ?
ten . &quot; whoop ass &quot; was kind of my thing .
still is .
i mean , i guess i always knew you were a little kid once ,
but i couldn &apos;t picture it till i heard that .
like i couldn &apos;t picture me eating fruit
from an exxon station till i did that .
so , are you two ready to order ?
oh , yeah . i &apos;ll have the turkey club with fries .
this is why you &apos;re single , rita .
i &apos;m not single . i &apos;m married to your father .
i love you , but stop pushing your lifestyle in my face .
i &apos;ll have the salad . dressing on the side .
obvs .
obvs , obvs .
well , i &apos;m sending t @-@ rux back to my mother .
he &apos;s going right into this empty box i found in han &apos;s office .
and max , before you send it back ,
i &apos;m gonna need those batteries .
oh , don &apos;t worry , i have no desire to see you
hugging the milkshake machine .
oh ... my ... god !
is that a teddy ruxpin doll ?
rita , i want that !
your birthday just passed , elliot .
but my coming out party is coming up .
what is that , like a queen @-@ ceanera ?
so bitchy . love her .
a vintage teddy ruxpin is worth like , $ 500,
and my mom works , so she has to buy my love .
one more word , and i &apos;m taking away spa day .
that &apos;s harsh , honey .
he &apos;s obsessed with the &apos; 90s .
but you weren &apos;t even born .
i know . i blame her .
she couldn &apos;t find a man till late in life .
there go the pedicures .
there go my sandals .
as much as i love watching will and grace ,
this guy &apos;s not for sale .
i &apos;m sending him back to my mother &apos;s place ,
which , according to the rhode island parole office ,
is a cardboard shanty town outside of big lots .
well , here &apos;s my card . and let &apos;s face it ,
you look like you could use $ 500 .
so bitchy . love him !
i was just offered $ 500 for t @-@ rux
from baby anderson cooper .
he has cards ?
i &apos;m jealous of a nine @-@ year @-@ old ?
that &apos;s where i &apos;m at ?
hey , as much as i would like that $ 500,
my mother doesn &apos;t get to think this bear
gets to make up for my childhood .
she doesn &apos;t get off that easy .
trust me , we shared a pullout couch for nine months .
girls , can i see you over here ?
i can &apos;t believe we have to talk to the fish again .
i can &apos;t believe max hasn &apos;t put han in the tank yet .
max , caroline , every night from now on ,
i need you to move the skimmer along the top of the water
and take out the floating matter .
han , you know i &apos;m off diner poop patrol for life
after i had to clean the booth where the senior left ...
well , we &apos;ll just call it an elderberry .
well , caroline , max said no , so you have to do it .
han , you &apos;re kind of a baller around your fish .
all right , i &apos;m gonna do this fast .
get in and get out--
same thing i do when that bird is in our shower .
pick up , max .
look , i &apos;m calling to tell you i met somebody else
so i &apos;m breaking up with you .
now put your mother on . i &apos;m breaking up with her too .
i can &apos;t believe this .
i &apos;m a cabana boy for fish .
i guess now i can add &quot; fish poop remover &quot;
to my resume next to &quot; supreme court intern . &quot;
i feel like there was a fish in that last one .
yup .
oh , no , it &apos;s the expensive one !
that &apos;s so me .
i really didn &apos;t expect to see you
digging through garbage till you were 30 .
it &apos;s still alive !
i need to keep her wet .
oh , covered in tuna , that &apos;s gotta be traumatic for it .
i feel like it went down the drain .
it was an accident . i swear .
i love fish . i would never hurt one .
unless you count eating sushi ,
&apos;cause then i &apos;m like jack the ripper .
caroline , are things going swimmingly ?
jack , he &apos;s talking to you .
oh , yeah . swimmingly .
especially the blue one .
he went in his little house .
he doesn &apos;t like to use the restroom in front of his friends .
yeah , we &apos;re a lot alike .
thank you so much for seeing us so quickly .
sure , you guys can just wait in here .
elliot &apos;s finishing up with his pilates .
do yourselves a favor .
tell him his core looks tight .
max , i &apos;m so sorry you have to sell t @-@ rux
for the fish money because of me .
talked to the fist , because the face is pissed .
i &apos;m getting attitude from a bear ?
that &apos;s where i &apos;m at ?
i can &apos;t believe all this stuff he has from the &apos; 90s .
i can &apos;t believe he has to have a party to come out .
that kid came out , out .
his umbilical cord is a gucci belt .
oh ... these toys !
this is like looking back at my childhood
but , you know , a time before rainbows became political .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god .
a my size barbie !
i had ten of these .
not to play with , they were used as decoys
in case of a hostage situation .
and now your whole life &apos;s a hostage situation .
sorry i &apos;m late .
my trainer , gary , and i got derailed
talking about the real housewives of orange county .
your core looks really good .
i know , honey .
now while i get my check book , say hello to the olsens .
you got a lot of toys .
when i was a girl your age , i only had this .
i don &apos;t suppose i could play with my size barbie for a second .
i feel like that &apos;s a &quot; no , bitch . &quot;
i &apos;m not--i &apos;m not just talking about the toys .
you got a pretty sweet set @-@ up .
that nice lady out there , giving you everything you want ,
taking care of you .
she &apos;s just a mom . everyone has one .
not really . some people just have bad ass bears .
max , are you sure about this ?
this is the only thing you have from your childhood .
not true ,
i have a dent in my skull from a ball @-@ peen hammer .
the last time i change the channel during three &apos;s company .
can we fast forward this to me having the bear
and you two leaving ?
okay , just take it , it doesn &apos;t matter .
no , max . it does matter .
we &apos;re not selling this .
he has enough toys .
i mean , all i wanted to do was touch the life @-@ size barbie .
okay , i see what &apos;s happening .
i &apos;ve been down this road with the beanie babies .
i &apos;ll give you 600 for the bear .
sold .
no , max !
that &apos;s your childhood .
700 .
sold !
no , max !
caroline , my childhood is not worth $ 700 .
the most my mother ever got for me was 40 bucks
and a big gulp .
but that &apos;s &quot; little you &quot; in there , max .
and she &apos;s priceless .
and she &apos;s about to erased and taped over
by the soundtrack from frozen .
frozen ?
who am i ? me , a year ago ?
no . can &apos;t have her .
well , what are we gonna do now about the other child ?
the one in the diner ?
well , i guess he &apos;s just gonna have to grow up .
grow up ? you think if he had that ability ,
he wouldn &apos;t have used it yet ?
so what-- no bear ?
oh , please !
you &apos;ll have a bear in your life . trust me .
all right , max .
you &apos;re gonna help me tell him , right ?
you like giving him bad news .
no , i like giving him bad news about
how he &apos;s short and has a big head .
you know , fun bad news .
exciting news !
i got the fishies a new house !
i got it cheap . it was a foreclosure .
而导致了抵押房屋被强制收回
uh , han , can we talk to you over there in the booth--
the far booth ?
can it wait ? i want to put in the new condo
so max will stop calling me a slum lord .
oh , that can wait ,
i mean , those fish aren &apos;t going anywhere .
except for the blue one , who &apos;s definitely playing
some kind of twisted game of hide and seek .
oh , yeah , he loves that little house .
he &apos;s going to love this one even more .
max , can you join me ?
i &apos;m pretty busy waiting on tables right now .
okay , what &apos;s going on ?
max has never waited on a table in her life .
max , i need you over here .
i &apos;m just putting down this grilled cheese
&apos;cause i don &apos;t want it to get cold .
now i &apos;m freaking out !
max , don &apos;t do this to me .
i know where the bodies are buried , literally .
i move them every six months .
well , what is it ?
han , sometimes in life ,
things happen that you don &apos;t want to happen .
yes .
and even though it &apos;s hard , you know ,
you just have to face up to it .
i suppose .
oh , dear god , this is rough .
and , well ...
han , i don &apos;t wanna have to tell you this ,
i know this is the last thing you ever want to hear--
oh , just say it !
the tampon machine is broken again .
later , i &apos;ll get my blindfold and fix it .
word of advice ?
when you do finally kill me ,
you gotta work on your game face for the cops .
max , please .
i can &apos;t tell han i murdered his fish .
i can &apos;t .
well , i can &apos;t tell him either .
oh , hell , i &apos;ll tell him .
i &apos;m a black man ,
everyone already assumes i did it .
thank you . thank you so much .
it &apos;s just a fish . he &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;ve decided i &apos;ll give blue the new house
at its birthday party later .
it &apos;s the damn fish &apos;s birthday ?
i &apos;m out .
and you &apos;re all invited .
blue &apos;s two years old today .
they don &apos;t usually live that long .
no , they do not .
that &apos;s it , we can &apos;t tell him .
even at han &apos;s age , which i am guessing
is somewhere between 14 and 53,
some kids just aren &apos;t ready to grow up .
what are we gonna do ?
we &apos;re gonna run out and buy a new one .
where are we gonna get the money ?
oleg ,
you know how two years ago you offered me $ 1,000
for a back rub ?
of course .
caroline will do it for $ 500 .
deal . one last hurrah .
over the clothes , above the waist ,
and i don &apos;t know why , but you have to wear a condom .
yes , father dominic rosello , please .
oh , he &apos;s celebrating mass ?
oh yeah , could you just tell him that sophie kachinski
is converting to monogamy ?
and uh , she won &apos;t be kneeling at his altar anymore .
oh , yeah , yeah , he &apos;ll understand .
where &apos;s han and does he know ?
no , but i can &apos;t keep pretending i see that fish .
i &apos;m a pot @-@ head with a touch of glaucoma .
i &apos;m seeing stuff that &apos;s not there .
not seeing stuff that &apos;s there .
it &apos;s confusing .
okay . come on , come on .
put it in , put it in , put it in .
i have a whole new respect for every guy
that &apos;s ever gone out with you .
happy birthday , blue !
happy birthday . happy birthday , blue .
where &apos;s blue ?
i haven &apos;t seen her all day .
i just saw it .
yeah , it was definitely there .
you &apos;re not gonna give blue that cupcake
without a photo @-@ op , are you ?
where &apos;s your i @-@ pad ?
i just saw it . yeah , it was definitely there .
yeah , han , go !
you need a pic so you can post it on facebook
or fishbook or whatever .
good idea . here , hold this .
hey , caroline , you look less flat .
you finally get that boob job you needed ?
i feel like the baggy broke .
yup , that &apos;s what happens when you get the cheap implants .
oh , my god , there is definitely something
moving around in my bra .
well , it &apos;s good you can still recognize that feeling .
it &apos;s right--oh ! oh ! i touched it !
gross !
someone , put your hand in my bra and help me .
why now ? now that i &apos;m off the market !
no , no , no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m gonna squish it and kill it again .
okay , just get up on the counter and drop it in the tank .
what ?
get up on the counter , spread your legs ,
and just let it fall into the tank .
you know what ?
forget the back rub . after this , we &apos;re square .
okay , straddle the tank , pull out your uniform ,
and let it go .
now i owe you money .
just squat over the tank like you &apos;re delivering
a fish baby .
i &apos;m delivering a fish baby ?
this is where i &apos;m at ?
stop asking . that &apos;s where you &apos;re at .
okay , now that i saw , right ?
caroline , get down !
it &apos;s not that kind of party .
max , you &apos;re really still gonna send t @-@ rux back ?
after we got bullied by a kid
with a tiffani amber thiessen pillow ?
relax , t @-@ rux is right over there by the register .
and by the way , he &apos;s our first employee .
anytime we get a bone @-@ head customer , he can say ,
&quot; talk to the fist ... &quot;
&quot; &apos; cause the face is pissed . &quot;
i &apos;m just sending my mother something
to say thank you for everything she gave me
when i was a child .
aww , what &apos;s in there ?
nothing !
