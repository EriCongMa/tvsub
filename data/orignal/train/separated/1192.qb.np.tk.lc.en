this is for you .
it &apos;s what you need to read
before your meeting with brendan mcgowan .
he &apos;s going to help you with college .
hey , what &apos;s this song ?
it &apos;s not a song that tippy &apos;s singing . it &apos;s a phone number .
where is this area code , anyways ?
york county .
did ali know anybody from there ?
there was a college there , i just saw it . cicero .
yeah , look .
想知道真相 就带她来找我 亲亲 -a
i gave the rv to &quot; a &quot; for nothing .
i think &quot; a &quot; gave you something real .
we &apos;ve got to find dr. palmer .
will you tell her to stay away from that girl ?
what girl ?
that blonde girl .
are you brendan ?
yeah . if you want ,
i could go through some of these schools with you .
i didn &apos;t think that you were the type of person
who would lead somebody on just to get what you wanted .
you &apos;ve never had to be charming
&apos;cause mommy and daddy
have a safety net of cash to catch your fall .
what did you say to mom to make her change her mind about europe ?
the only reason you want her to go so bad
is so you could start boffing your teacher again .
that was mrs. grunwaltz , our former house mother .
legend has it she was fired .
apparently you couldn &apos;t get anything past that bitch .
detective wilden , he &apos;s dead .
hanna &apos;s worried that they &apos;re going to try to pin it on her mom .
they are both going to need help .
i keep a gun locked in my desk .
it &apos;s missing .
it &apos;s the gun . at least i think it is .
why do you have that ?
i found it in my mom &apos;s closet .
i have to get rid of it .
hold it ! don &apos;t move .
you won &apos;t say why you had the gun .
or where you got the gun .
or why it appeared you were burying the gun on a college campus .
you want some ?
hanna ,
you don &apos;t need a lawyer to tell me
whether or not you &apos;d like a cup coffee .
no , thank you .
how about i tell you what i know ?
you were carrying a concealed firearm without a license .
the gun is a .38 caliber revolver .
yours holds six bullets ,
but you had only four .
straightaway you gotta wonder
where the other bullets went , right ?
you could be looking at a third @-@ degree felony charge
for carrying a concealed weapon .
that &apos;s up to a seven @-@ year sentence .
hanna , i do not want to see that happen to you .
neither do you . neither do your parents .
but i need you to think about who you &apos;re trying to protect
and why .
how do you know i wasn &apos;t just protecting myself ?
a hunch .
that &apos;ll be your mom .
hanna , we &apos;re going .
her bail &apos;s been paid and her lawyer &apos;s on the way .
come on .
i will walk you out .
they called you ?
they &apos;re keeping the gun . for testing .
what kind of testing ?
dad .
the kind that determines whether your dad &apos;s gun
was used to kill a police officer .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
well , i thought maybe you &apos;d be at school today .
are you okay ? what &apos;s going on ?
there &apos;s no school until the d.a. calls .
i could get seven years--
seven years ? for what ?
carrying a concealed weapon ,
attempting to destroy evidence .
murder . i don &apos;t know , whatever they find .
you &apos;re not a murderer .
well , i &apos;m ruining my mom &apos;s life ,
so that &apos;s gotta count for something .
hanna , listen to me .
&quot; a &quot; planted your mom &apos;s cell phone in wilden &apos;s casket .
&quot; a &quot; fished that car out of the lake .
and two days ago , &quot; a &quot; called the cops on you .
this is a set up .
god , was that just two days ago ?
maybe this is it , hanna .
i think you have to tell your parents about &quot; a. &quot;
no . em ,
none of that matters if my mom pulled the trigger .
she &apos;s the one who lied about where she was the night wilden died ,
and she &apos;s the one with a gun in her closet .
hey , emily .
em ? are you there ?
i need to call you right back , okay .
what are you doing here ? and why are you wearing that ?
i &apos;m on the team . as of today .
you go to rosewood now ?
yeah .
so , you just switched schools mid @-@ semester ? why ?
better swim team ,
better chance of a scholarship .
plus , i didn &apos;t like private school .
i never really fit in .
i &apos;m sorry about your shoulder . must suck to be off the team .
i know how much it meant to you .
you don &apos;t know anything about me .
jenna &apos;s told me a few things .
looks fun . too late to sign up ?
i need to know exactly what you told the cops .
word for word .
i didn &apos;t tell them anything .
i said nothing about your gun ,
i didn &apos;t say a word .
yeah , well , you &apos;re gonna tell me .
where you found it , and why the hell you took it to that college .
what were you thinking ?
i was trying to protect mom .
protect mom ? hanna ...
if you took that gun from my office--
i did not take the gun .
i found it in mom &apos;s luggage from new york .
shut that thing off , and come downstairs .
when you called me back from that sorority party ,
i thought you were gonna tell me that you &apos;d found
the person ali was talking to , not that--
hanna got arrested .
yeah . not that .
where &apos;s emily ? it &apos;s not like her to be late .
i don &apos;t know , maybe she got a hold of hanna .
yeah , or she could be avoiding me .
all right , well you need to apologize or get over it
or do whatever you have to do , okay ?
i don &apos;t care who said what to who ,
but we need all brains on board
and we &apos;re already down one . you got it ?
aye aye , captain .
taste this . it &apos;s disgusting .
no , you just spit in it .
hey , em .
you talk to hanna ?
is this mine ?
yeah , but don &apos;t .
how is she ?
freaked out .
she &apos;s waiting to hear back from the d.a. about the charges .
meanwhile , the cops are running tests on her dad &apos;s gun
to see if it was used to kill wilden .
they can actually do that ?
yeah . it &apos;s called ballistics .
when you fire a gun , the barrel leaves grooves on the bullet .
like a pattern .
and if the pattern of that barrel matches the bullet
that killed wilden , then bam , that &apos;s the murder weapon .
and there &apos;s more . shana &apos;s back . permanently .
she enrolled at rosewood high ,
and took my spot on the swim team .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about the girl who may have tried to set us on fire ,
run you over , sitting next to us in social studies .
but why ? what does shana have against us ?
well , mona said shana was in love with jenna .
and that they were both afraid of melissa ...
who moved to london .
so , melissa moves out ; shana moves in .
and jenna gets a new seeing eye dog at rosewood high .
on top of everything ,
guess who &apos;s in charge of training the new guy
and running the open mic night tomorrow ?
hey , let me help .
just sit down , settle in , okay ?
i &apos;ll deal with it , my brother knows him .
hi . first day ?
that obvious ?
you &apos;re connor , right ?
you play lacrosse with mike .
yeah .
well , at least you &apos;re better on the field .
i just wish that i could erase everything from that night .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
i should have told you the real reason why i was there .
well , how could you ?
i bulldozed over every opportunity that you had .
i bulldozed over you .
i bulldozed over hanna when she tried to
tell me about the gun .
i &apos;m basically a human bulldozer .
and now i &apos;m bulldozing over your apology .
i &apos;m really sorry .
so , you excited for your game on saturday ?
guilford , right ?
yeah . mrs. welch is making me redo this essay ,
i got to get at least a b or i &apos;ll be sitting the bench .
maybe you could help .
mike says you &apos;re , like , some writing genius .
maybe you could just look it over ? make sure it &apos;s in english ?
yeah , sure . i could do that .
great .
she found the gun in your bag , ashley .
in your closet .
hanna , how could you say that ?
because it &apos;s true .
let her talk .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
i was looking for your shoes and then--
they were ruined . i threw them out .
this isn &apos;t about what she was looking for .
it &apos;s about what she found .
you took my gun .
tom , you have no idea what happened .
well , please , tell me !
i didn &apos;t kill anyone
and i did not bring a gun into this house .
then who did , ashley ?
i don &apos;t know .
i am telling the truth . i don &apos;t know !
if it turns out that my gun
was used to kill a police officer--
someone is setting me up !
who ?
who would do that ?
i don &apos;t know .
i--
do you know crazy this sounds ?
他们两个都将受到惩罚 亲亲 -a
guys .
ugh . mo &apos; mona , mo &apos; problems .
can i talk to you ?
where the hell have you been ?
i &apos;m sorry , that wasn &apos;t a question .
i need to talk to you . alone .
you said we were in this together ,
and then you just disappeared .
whatever you have to say to spencer ,
you can say to all of us .
have it your way .
i &apos;ve been tracking down my missing rv .
that &apos;s where i &apos;ve been .
toby took it . he gave it to &quot; a , &quot;
but spencer already knew that .
she &apos;s been covering for him .
you &apos;re lying .
i &apos;m really not .
then you &apos;d better have proof .
look , i &apos;ll take heels over a hoodie any day of the week ,
but just &apos; cause i &apos;m not &quot; a &quot; anymore ,
doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t recon your asses
swhen i need to .
so , yeah , i have proof .
spencer , say something .
it &apos;s true .
mona may not be &quot; a , &quot;
but she is definitely still a &quot; b. &quot;
did you see that smirk on her face ?
i just can &apos;t believe that spencer
wouldu see that keep that from us .
you know there was a reason toby did this .
i mean , there has to be .
reason or not ,
i can &apos;t help thinking hanna wouldn &apos;t be in this mess
if we still had that rv .
what if mona had something
that could prove that hanna &apos;s mom was innocent ?
proof that somebody else wanted wilden dead .
a video , a photo , anything .
hanna ?
my parents took my cell phone , so don &apos;t call it .
okay .
her parents took her phone .
look , hanna , we have to tell you something .
well , can it wait ? they could pick up any minute .
yeah , yeah , of course .
you have to tell her to talk to her parents .
&quot; a &quot; is framing my mom ,
all right . she didn &apos;t kill wilden ,
she didn &apos;t put the gun in her overnight bag .
&quot; a &quot; did . i walked right into the trap .
all right , what emily thinks--
i know what emily thinks ,
but i can &apos;t say anything to them .
because &quot; a &quot; is threatening to
take down my mom and my dad
if i say one thing about my mom being framed .
one word , one freaking letter ,
my whole family &apos;s locked up .
tom , don &apos;t--
don &apos;t call her .
she needs to know this .
she already does .
she doesn &apos;t want us to do anything to help .
are we gonna listen ?
damn it , tom , he threatened me .
he threatened hanna .
i couldn &apos;t come up with the kind of money
he wanted to get him to leave town ,
so i took the gun for protection .
you have no idea what we &apos;ve been through .
no , you can &apos;t just show up here-
you came to me for money , and you left with my gun .
don &apos;t act like i &apos;m not involved .
i was scared , okay ?
i took the gun because i didn &apos;t know what was gonna happen .
he grabbed the gun out of my hands , and i ran .
i swear to god , i did not shoot him .
hey .
hello , caleb .
oh , caleb .
are you okay ? i &apos;ve been trying to reach you .
look , i know you &apos;re worried about hanna ,
but you cannot be here right now .
no , you need to leave . now .
no , dad , stop--
hanna , please .
she &apos;s in a lot of trouble .
the less people she speaks to the better .
i am not here to question her . i &apos;m here to help .
you can &apos;t right now .
caleb , we will call you if anything happens .
just please , go .
i knew that this would happen .
now , instead of finding out from us ,
they found out from mona .
if we just tell them the truth ,
i know that they &apos;ll understand .
if we tell them , it &apos;s over .
i &apos;ll never know what happened to my mom .
why ? why would you say that ?
toby .
i went back to radley .
i talked to eddie lamb .
i asked him all about what dr. palmer said ,
about the blonde girl . all of it .
and what did he say ? did he mention ali ?
no .
he knows something , but he &apos;s not gonna tell me .
neither will my dad .
you spoke with your father about this ?
i tried to .
it didn &apos;t go well .
look , i &apos;ve run out of leads , spence .
but &quot; a &quot; still knows something .
&quot; a &quot; is the only chance i have of finding out
what really happened to my mom .
spencer , what are you doing ?
look , i &apos;m not gonna force you to change your mind ,
but i have to fix this , with or without you .
who are you calling ?
i &apos;ve got to earn back some trust .
gamma zeta chi .
hi , my name is spencer ...
i can &apos;t believe you copied the cliff &apos;s notes .
well , it was the only thing that made sense .
and i used proper citation .
yes , i see that . it &apos;s right next to the footnote for wikipedia .
connor ?
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m helping him with his english paper .
you going out ?
yeah , what &apos;s it look like ?
okay , well when are you going to be back ?
later .
did you talk to mom today ?
yep .
hey , have fun .
all right , so ...
page three . just because faulkner used run @-@ on sentences ,
does not mean that you get to .
is he cool with me being here ?
yeah , it &apos;s not about you .
hanna ?
i can &apos;t believe that they let you in .
my dad practically threw caleb out the door .
i brought an excuse .
homework .
thank you .
wait , i &apos;m not in physics .
i was counting on your parents not knowing that .
must be weird having your dad here .
i haven &apos;t really found a word for it yet . but yeah .
how are you ? really .
i &apos;m in purgatory .
a condition of temporary punishment and suffering ,
from which i may never leave . i looked it up ,
along with everything i could find on prosecuting minors
and state minimums for third @-@ degree federal offenses .
that was before they took away my internet .
if your mom didn &apos;t ...
do it , then it may not be the gun , hanna .
okay , we don &apos;t know for sure .
&quot; a &quot; can &apos;t tamper with ballistics evidence .
we don &apos;t know what &quot; a &quot; can and cannot do .
the sooner we accept that , the better .
look , i &apos;m not just here for fake homework .
i want the dash cam footage that mona gave you .
the one from wilden &apos;s car .
no . hell no .
you don &apos;t even know what i want it for .
i don &apos;t care . emily ,
my mom is in that video hitting wilden with a car , all right .
i should have just listened to mona
and burned it the second that she gave it to me .
but you didn &apos;t .
the first half of the video looks bad for your mom ,
but the second half proves
that jenna and shana are connected to wilden .
they carried him off the road in the middle of the night
and no one reported anything .
the cops need to see that .
it could look like they were hurting him , and not helping him .
and at the very least , it adds in two more suspects to the mix .
look , anything i do backfires .
if i say one word about &quot; a , &quot; my dad goes down .
do you get that ?
that &apos;s if you say something , hanna , not me .
please , hanna . this could be your only chance .
and the cops never have to know where it came from .
i really appreciate this .
mrs. welch is a freak about references .
no , i &apos;m happy to help .
this was fun .
i told you faulkner wasn &apos;t all that bad .
i meant you . it &apos;s nice hanging out with you .
thanks .
next time we ought to do this over burgers instead of books .
oh , no . you don &apos;t need that much help . you &apos;ll do fine .
oh , but have a great game saturday .
go sports , and all that .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m not interested like that .
ashley . ashley !
you trying to burn the house down ?
it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re not fine .
what did veronica say ?
they don &apos;t know anything yet .
what else ?
ash .
the fact that we haven &apos;t heard anything ,
not about hanna , not about the gun ...
it &apos;s not a good sign .
oh ! damn it !
just leave me alone , all right ?
just leave me alone for two seconds .
just , hold onto this .
just tell me it was self @-@ defense .
people could believe that .
i could believe that .
believe what you want , tom .
i already told you what happened .
hanna wanted me to give you this .
she also wanted me to cop a feel on her behalf , but ...
her parents said they would call me if anything happened ,
but i haven &apos;t heard anything .
well , maybe that &apos;s a good thing .
we have the truth on our side this time .
em !
hey , emily .
i &apos;ve been looking for you .
i know who ali was calling .
at least i think i do .
i was talking to all of these sorority girls ,
and they didn &apos;t know anything about a hidden room .
but a couple years ago , there was this housemother--
the grunwald .
yeah .
exactly . and she would disappear for hours at a time ,
and then all of the sudden , poof , she would reappear
as if she &apos;d never left the house .
what if mrs. grunwald was using that hidden room ?
what if that &apos;s who ali was calling ?
i don &apos;t think the grunwald wore board shorts .
okay , so we got that part wrong .
but this is our chance to get it right .
mrs. grunwald could know who was after ali .
it could be &quot; a. &quot;
it could be the same person who &apos;s framing hanna &apos;s mom .
look , you wanna help hanna , right ?
so , let &apos;s go talk to mrs. grunwald today , okay ?
you and me .
spencer , stop .
having mona &apos;s rv could &apos;ve helped hanna .
and i &apos;m not going on another wild goose chase with you
just so you can clear your guilty conscience .
look , i want to explain everything , but i just can &apos;t . not yet .
i know you &apos;re trying to protect toby ,
but i really wish you &apos;d think about the people you were hurting .
hi . what &apos;s up ?
how could you do that ?
do what ?
hook up with connor last night !
what ?
where did you hear that ?
where do you think ? i was just in the locker room .
and you can &apos;t ...
excuse me . hi , i need to talk to you .
she can &apos;t get enough , can she ?
all right , in case you or any of your friends are confused ,
you tried to kiss me ,
and i pushed you off , and then you left .
all right ? that &apos;s what happened .
that &apos;s all that happened , okay ?
you can quit the innocent virgin act .
what are you talking about ?
everyone knows you and mr. fitz
weren &apos;t just scrabble buddies .
excuse me ?
how many points for the word &quot; slut &quot; ?
ms. montgomery , you shouldn &apos;t be in here .
you still okay on gas ?
yeah .
is she expecting you ? mrs. grunwald ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry , spencer .
i know .
是不是对你来说 我还不够成熟
are you okay ?
what happened in there ?
before i came in .
aria , those guys are jerks .
you can &apos;t just let some stupid rumor get to you--
it &apos;s not just &quot; some stupid rumor &quot;
if there &apos;s some truth to it , ezra .
look , you cannot be the guy that helps me feel better anymore .
don &apos;t you get that ?
just stay away from me . please .
do you see a street sign anywhere ?
no . nothing .
excuse me .
sorry , i think we &apos;re lost .
do you know if saw mill road is up ahead ?
let &apos;s get out of here .
mona . we need to talk .
we &apos;re talking now ?
tell me what &quot; a &quot; has on toby .
&apos;kay ? i need to know .
don &apos;t we all ?
mona , please . i want in .
on what ?
on whatever it is you have going on .
you tracked down your rv . you found out about spencer and toby .
you &apos;ve got the fast track on &quot; a , &quot;
while the rest of us have nothing .
i &apos;m not the one pulling the strings anymore , emily .
all i have is an empty rv .
everything bad that i &apos;ve done , everything you &apos;ve done ,
&quot; a &quot; has proof .
one wrong move and we all go up in flames .
maybe this time , we don &apos;t get out of them .
are you sure this is the right place ?
yeah , this is the address .
excuse me ?
hi . we were hoping to speak with mrs. grunwald . is she home ?
it &apos;s important .
there &apos;s no one here but me .
and i only deal with the master of the house .
well , we must have the wrong address .
i &apos;m starving . let &apos;s grab something to eat .
i &apos;m not hungry .
i mean , i have a large pit in my stomach ,
but i &apos;m not hungry .
you definitely need to eat something .
i &apos;m not driving back to rosewood with low @-@ blood @-@ sugar spencer .
that &apos;s worse than no @-@ caffeine spencer .
wow , your girlfriend sounds awesome .
mrs. grunwald ?
it was three summers ago . it was all over the news .
well , i must have missed it .
well , my friends and i aren &apos;t really sure that she &apos;s gone .
maybe you still know this person .
i didn &apos;t know her alive . i certainly don &apos;t know her dead .
maybe you only spoke with her on the phone .
she might &apos;ve gone by the name vivian .
look , she thought that somebody was after her ,
so maybe she was asking for help ,
or a place to stay .
i &apos;m sorry , it doesn &apos;t ring a bell .
the girls said you disappeared everyday for hours at a time
and then you would suddenly reappear as if you &apos;d never left .
so , i know that it was you on that phone .
and then one day you were gone . isn &apos;t that right ?
were you running some kind of business ?
i &apos;m very sorry about your friend , really .
but i can &apos;t help you .
i &apos;m not who you think i am .
excuse me .
go away .
hey , can i talk to you ?
mike , just leave me alone , please .
aria ...
look , i &apos;m sorry your whole team thinks i &apos;m a slut .
i &apos;m sorry about mom going away . i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
i messed up .
i should &apos;ve known that connor was making that stuff up .
look , i &apos;m your brother .
i &apos;m supposed to watch out for you .
stand up for you .
i &apos;m gonna make it up to you , okay ?
okay ?
where &apos;ve you been ?
i didn &apos;t do anything . i just needed some air .
you know , i took the old footpath behind the mendez house .
the one that leads to the pond .
you used to take me skating there when i was little .
now it &apos;s all dried up .
that happens this time of year .
but it &apos;ll fill up again .
this is all my fault .
it &apos;s my fault that mom ever got involved with wilden .
it &apos;s my fault the police found the gun .
god , how could i be so stupid ?
i mean , i try to fix things . and it just ...
it just gets worse .
hanna , i wish you &apos;d come to me .
well , the way caleb described it ...
honestly , dad ...
i didn &apos;t think you wanted me to .
she would rather fry the hair off her head than talk to me .
she could be telling the truth .
she &apos;s not .
i know you don &apos;t want to go back home empty @-@ handed ,
but we have to face facts .
you &apos;re following a lead that came from a bird .
maybe it was never a real clue .
maybe alison &apos;s grandmother called that number instead of ali .
you have to learn when to let go , spencer .
me ? i need to learn when to let things go ?
i might be trusting a bird , but you &apos;re trusting &quot; a. &quot;
i &apos;m gonna go see what they have across the street .
you sure you don &apos;t want anything ?
spencer , what is it ?
shana &apos;s here . i just saw her .
that &apos;s jenna &apos;s car .
come on .
get in , get in !
go , go , go , go , go , go .
what was that ?
what the hell was that ?
oh , my god .
chocolate or raspberry ?
&apos;kay , you can stop with the sympathy food .
chocolate . obviously .
look , if i could &apos;ve had anyone else working tonight ,
you know i would have .
no , it &apos;s fine . really .
and plus i don &apos;t have anything to be ashamed of .
says my suddenly wise younger brother .
well , if it makes you feel better ,
i did put him on garbage duty .
huh , it does . thank you .
any chance you &apos;re still talking to me ?
yeah .
how was the grunwald ?
she said that she didn &apos;t know ali .
but i think that shana got to her first .
you think or you know ?
i saw her there . shana. in creepy @-@ ville .
what is lieutenant tanner doing here ?
maybe she &apos;s into slam poetry ?
emily .
lieutenant tanner , hi .
did my mom tell you about the event tonight ?
uh @-@ uh . i saw a flyer up at the station .
but i &apos;m not here for the music .
can you get someone to cover you for you for a moment ?
me ?
um , yeah . sure .
good . i need you at the station .
alone . it won &apos;t take long .
is this supposed to be you ?
i don &apos;t know .
someone saw you here this morning putting up a flyer .
an hour later i find this on my desk .
i didn &apos;t write this .
there &apos;s a mother &apos;s day card on your mom &apos;s desk .
handwriting &apos;s a match .
did she see this ?
not yet .
let &apos;s say you didn &apos;t put this on my desk .
who did ?
it &apos;s probably someone &apos;s idea of a prank .
some prank . framing someone for murder .
holbrook ?
okay . i &apos;m coming .
we &apos;re gonna have to continue this later .
first hanna , now emily .
don &apos;t say it like that .
like what ?
like one of us is next .
tell me about shana .
there &apos;s not that much to tell , really .
i saw her in that town ,
and then she jumped in jenna &apos;s car
and she drove away .
we tried to follow , but we lost her .
no , you didn &apos;t .
hey , stop ! stop , that &apos;s my car .
what are you doing ?
anything you say can and will be used against you
in a court of law .
you have the right to an attorney ,
if you--
she didn &apos;t do it !
one will be appointed to you--
you have to believe me .
you can &apos;t do this . she didn &apos;t do it .
mom ! come on , tell her that you didn &apos;t do it .
that gun was used to kill detective wilden ,
and your mother &apos;s fingerprints are on the bullets .
i need you to look after hanna .
whatever she needs ,
whatever happens to me , please ...
mom ...
i love you .
