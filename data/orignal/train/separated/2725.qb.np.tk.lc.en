... in the bottom of the eighth , a very tight game .
a hot day ...
it sure is today . it certainly is , roger .
mets tying it up two to two in the sixth .
man on second ...
want another super @-@ nacho ?
no , they been sittin &apos; too long . the cheese is sweaty .
this guy in the joint , crazy rasta fuck ,
made grilled cheese on the radiator .
he &apos;d put the bread between two sheets of paper .
had a whole system .
what &apos;d you do to your foot ? the other night in fuckin &apos; irvington
two black guys jumped me outside a bar .
with half of them locked up grilling cheese ,
you &apos;d think there wouldn &apos;t be so many around .
should i melt another batch ?
nah . i &apos;m good . i got dinner in the city .
so , finn , you got any plans for the summer ?
goin &apos; back to mission viejo to surf or whatever ?
i &apos;m hopin &apos; to stay here in the city .
how &apos;s summer school going ?
it sucks .
i did summer school once . you can still have fun .
casa carmela ? he &apos;s looking at maximum security summer .
excuse me a minute .
why don &apos;t you cut your mother a break ?
she &apos;s holdin &apos; this family together during this current situation and all .
can we get the check ?
the young man took care of it .
you paid the check ?
i figured since you &apos;re always so generous ,
i should reciprocate .
lucky you don &apos;t get your head handed to you .
let &apos;s get this straight.- you eat , i pay .
mr soprano ... no , when you have your own family
you pay .
let &apos;s go .
just take the money .
i didn &apos;t mean to bite your head off in there .
i didn &apos;t mean to overstep .
i just wanted to say thank you .
you &apos;re a good guy . i respect you trying .
and then he fell asleep right after .
he did call me late the next morning . and he sent flowers .
but other than that i haven &apos;t heard from him all week .
what &apos;d he say ?
that it was nice , you know .
and it was nice . he was very sweet .
you think what happened at the party
is an overture tony wants to get back together ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe .
he &apos;s droppin &apos; aj off later .
this is the last thing i need to get into now .
please , he never had it so good .
that &apos;s him .
you two should talk . let me just pee .
so
was your father in a rush now or something ?
no , says he was tired .
and to give you this and a kiss on the cheek .
thank god . the last thing i needed was to talk to him .
know who loved golf ? it was joey peeps .
may he rest in peace .
it &apos;s sad when they go young like that .
when they go ?
come on .
it was little carmine behind it .
payback for that whore of his ... lorraine calluzzo .
you don &apos;t know that for sure , john .
little carmine knew how fond i was of this kid , tony .
i picked him out of the chorus .
schooled him when he was my driver .
anything from your cop ?
some homeless fuck saw a guy limpin &apos; away .
then he wasn &apos;t sure .
i &apos;ll tell ya , i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m gonna get through joey &apos;s funeral .
and forget about ginny .
every christmas joey &apos;d send her a grandma &apos;s of maine coffee cake .
what &apos;s wrong ? you all right ?
is it his heart ?
no .
it &apos;s this fucking weather , sudden changes .
fucks up your respiratory system . come on .
i got you .
get some electrolytes in him .
we got you . that &apos;s it .
sit down . good , good .
that &apos;s it .
you &apos;re all right . you &apos;re all right .
the point i &apos;m trying to illustrate is that
of course no one wants all @-@ out conflict .
but historically , historical changes have come out of war .
as far as i &apos;m concerned it &apos;s a new day .
old treaties and ways of doing things are null and void.- exactly .
and the joe peeps thing ? where does that leave us ?
when you &apos;ve had a quadruple bypass like i did ,
it gives you a lot of time to think .
the only thing johnny understands is force .
but the fact is , though , we pissed on a bees &apos; nest .
what &apos;s the other option ? roll over ?
we could &apos;ve had a sit @-@ down .
the other captains , maybe.this isn &apos;t the un , angelo .
i won &apos;t let what happened to my father happen to me .
god forgive me , but you may be a stronger man than your dad was .
the fundamental question is
will i be as effective as a boss like my dad was ?
and i will be.even more so , but until i am ,
it &apos;ll be hard to verify that i think i &apos;ll be more effective .
i just talked to my parents .
they offered me a ticket home . no economic relief .
what &apos;d the lady at student placement say ?
i never went down there .
why didn &apos;t you ?
this economy , hello ?
i mean , even the crappiest mcjobs aren &apos;t there .
i wouldn &apos;t want to take away a job a minority could have .
just ... it doesn &apos;t cool anything anyway . leave it .
don &apos;t open the window , the garbage reeks .
why do we want to be in new york anyway ?
it was supposed to be fun , remember ?
summer before the big push of grad school ?
you could go out to jersey , sleep in comfort .
is that what you want ? no .
all i know is , i cannot go home and live with my parents .
i graduated .
i mean maybe i should go back out.i can work as a pa for josh &apos;s dad .
at least i &apos;d earn some cash .
you could come out for a week.wait , wait , wait . what ?
he &apos;s a photographer . i told you , he does major magazine ads ...
bmw , it &apos;s pretty cool stuff .
is that what you want ?
no .
but at least i &apos;d have money . - your thing with models .
there &apos;s no models .
what ?
it &apos;s interesting work .
as a career , actually , i mean ...
josh &apos;s dad saw my shots that won a prize in school .
said they were &quot; solidly unsentimental . &quot;
what are you talking about ? just blow off dental school ?
you haven &apos;t taken one photograph in a year .
you bitch every time i ask you
to take a snap of me and my friends .
i &apos;m just saying ...
i gave up junior year abroad to be with you.i know , and i wanna stay here .
i could come out west with you .
but i have to blow off the law centre .
is that what you want to do ?
i don &apos;t know . do you want me to come out ?
if you want to .
no , you need to say .
maybe we should stay out there.you could transfer to ucla .
fuck it .
it &apos;s roasting in here .
it &apos;s 10 : 30 . we can go to a movie .
what do you want to see ?
i don &apos;t know , you say .
no , you .
hello ?
mrs soprano . lee nieman returning . oh , hi , great , thank you .
i gave your secretary the broad strokes .
you &apos;re in the middle of a separation , the attorney retired .
right , bob greenberg .
at any rate ,
i &apos;m thinking it &apos;s time i move forward with the divorce proceedings .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m gonna have to cut you short .
as far as handling it , i have to recuse myself .
what do you mean ?
actually , your husband had been in to see me for a consultation last year .
my husband hired you ? no
but based on a prior meeting , the code of professional responsibility
precludes me from representing you because of that consultation .
he met with greenberg , and he wanted to represent me .
mr greenberg would &apos;ve found himself in
a bit of ethical soup had he moved forward .
i don &apos;t understand this . why is my husband so picky ?
he talked to several top divorce attorneys in new jersey .
you can probably figure that manoeuvre out for yourself .
jesus christ .
i understand your frustration . i can recommend a colleague .
someone your husband hasn &apos;t contaminated .
well , yeah , ok .
accordin &apos; to johnny sack , the kid &apos;s brains were splattered over the seat .
joe peeps ?
couldn &apos;t have been too much to clean up .
i heard the hooker he was with got it in the chest .
must have been silicone everywhere , too .
why you always try and top me ?
you took the air outta my fuckin &apos; punch line .
anyway , joey peeps &apos; mom &apos;s a widow ,
she &apos;s in a wheelchair .
johnny &apos;s takin &apos; care of the interment , that shit there .
so i &apos;m thinkin &apos; we should pick up the headstone .
jason , get into it .
i &apos;ll call the marble guy .
what &apos;s up , guys ?
frank .
frankie .
talk to you outside ?
gimme two .
what &apos;s up ?
turns out somebody got a look at the guy that did joe peeps .
all they got so far is he &apos;s got a bad limp .
long john silver , maybe .
where the fuck do you get the balls ?
i am bendin &apos; over backwards tryin &apos; to stay neutral ,
payin &apos; for fuckin &apos; car seats .
and you &apos;re out there actin &apos; like a fuckin &apos; free agent !
don &apos;t look at me like i &apos;m a jerkoff .
i &apos;m sick of you leanin &apos; on this cousin thing and that bad hijack ,
like you can do whatever the fuck it is you want
cos you went away that night and i didn &apos;t !
you keep bringin &apos; that up . i &apos;m fine with it .
first of all , i had nothin &apos; to do with this .
don &apos;t fuckin &apos; lie to me !
if i was ,
would you really wanna know ?
that &apos;d just be another problem for you with johnny , right ?
i know you &apos;re not earning what you expected .
and you got the twins , and nancy .
you &apos;re a capable guy .
your mother let it slip one time . you got an iq of 158 .
she told you that ?
the week you got tested .
all the nuns were raving about it .
lot of good it did me .
i had high hopes when you got out .
yeah ? look , a guy like you ... brains , balls ...
if you &apos;d fucking be straight with me i could use all that .
put me in , coach .
all right , we got the casino on bloomfield avenue above the hardware store .
carlo &apos;s guy was running it , but he just got diagnosed with hodgkin &apos;s .
that &apos;s mine ?
yeah .
a lot of fucking money there .
i &apos;ll see what i can do about getting you straightened out ,
opening up the books for you .
it &apos;s long overdue .
so i solved a major problem business @-@ wise .
put a very good piece of manpower to work .
my cousin tony.you mentioned how close you two are .
when we were kids they called me tony uncle johnny and him tony uncle al .
right , yes . you told me all that .
anyway , a very smart guy . he &apos;s got an iq of 158 .
do you put a lot of stock into that number ?
why , are you gonna tell me it &apos;s bullshit ?
cos i took that test and somebody gets a 158,
well , they know a few things .
so we can assume you think he &apos;s smarter than you .
honestly , i think he &apos;s smarter than you the way you keep shitting on the test .
but i &apos;m no gabadotz myself . this was a good move .
carmela and i slept together .
what was that like ?
it was nice .
it was very ...
erotic .
she was wearing that perfume that she wears .
poor thing was starved for it , honestly .
i &apos;m the only man she &apos;s ever been with .
did you discuss it ?
nah , i left before she woke up .
how come ?
if she woke up and i was there it would send mixed signals , you know .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the best ...
yeah .
no . tell him i got fax machines coming out of my ass .
and would you characterise the separation thus far as amicable ?
it &apos;s barely civil .
yeah , there are moments when old habits kick in . and feelings .
but he is not the person i want to spend the rest of my life with .
fair enough . as for the assets ...
you &apos;ve given me your tax returns and investments ?
the house is in my name . not the boat .
that &apos;s the stugots , is it ?
yes .
i &apos;m a little concerned that the returns don &apos;t reflect everything .
there is other income , there &apos;s a lot more .
unreported income ?
yes .
and this other income , is it from an illegal stream ?
no , of course not .
but he does deal in cash , my husband . the carting business .
i see .
is that a problem ?
i handled a case once
where the husband owned vending machines .
i used a forensic accountant to reconstruct his finances .
in less than a week ,
he outlined 11 years of income .
and we &apos;re talking coins .
hey , you . busy day ?
i dropped off an application at the cineplex on broadway .
stopped by my dad &apos;s .
he got you a job working construction .
construction ? that &apos;s awesome .
it &apos;s in jersey , though . you &apos;ll have to take the path train .
fine , no problem .
but the most i ever did , though , is help my dad paint .
he said you don &apos;t need experience . you &apos;ll be a labourer or something .
pays like 20 bucks an hour .
holy shit .
how is that even possible ?
you believe these fucking blue jays ?
last inning i screamed so loud my wife thought i had a heart attack .
why , what happened ?
burrell got shelled . it was beautiful .
what are you , a met fan ?
padres .
padres ?
i &apos;m from california .
i gotta go make my collections .
stick with the angels . the pads haven &apos;t had a team in 20 years .
what do you mean ? they were in the series in &apos; 98 .
yanks in four , i was there .
hey , shaggy , grab a bucket and some lysol . scrub off my tyres .
there &apos;s fuckin &apos; dogshit by the entrance .
i &apos;m supposed to be picking up scrap .
you &apos;ll be pickin &apos; up your teeth in another second .
detrolio , you need somethin &apos; to do ?
get fuckin &apos; lost !
come on , guys .
go ! before it sets in the treads !
my checks come in yet ?
i don &apos;t know . i didn &apos;t see the girl .
if she ain &apos;t got them , send meadow &apos;s friend when he &apos;s done with your car .
who meadow ? what are you talking about ?
meadow soprano . that &apos;s her boyfriend .
there he is .
i can &apos;t find any lysol .
don &apos;t worry about it . why didn &apos;t you tell me you were datin &apos; my niece ?
here .
you take her someplace nice .
tell her it &apos;s from uncle paulie .
thank you , i ... that &apos;s really nice .
here . gimme that shit .
paulie ! come here .
get the hose .
sorry i &apos;m late .
you been waiting long ?
not really .
so , to what do i owe this pleasure ?
well , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re gonna see it that way .
i have asked you to lunch to tell you i &apos;m filing for divorce .
i hope you brought your appetite .
why don &apos;t you give us a minute ?
that &apos;s nice .
invite me to a ...
public place so you could ambush me .
do you think i won &apos;t make a scene ?
spare me your outrage , tony .
accept that i am moving on with my life .
moving on ?
that &apos;s what you were doing after the party ?
you and i both know that didn &apos;t change anything .
we &apos;re italian , we don &apos;t believe in divorce .
we believe in the nuclear family.will you listen to yourself ?
and despite your best efforts ,
i have an attorney who is going to aggressively pursue my custody of aj
and also an equitable distribution of our assets .
our assets ?
i am through trying to get you to provide beyond the minimum i need to live .
so it &apos;s fucking money . that &apos;s all this is to you ?
after all we &apos;ve been through , is it so hard to own up to anything
beyond that bullshit tax return ?
go stand over there . i &apos;ll call you when i &apos;m ready .
you want money ?
my 40 grand you stole out of the bird feeder ?
it should be plenty . you &apos;re an investment genius .
you want this to get ugly ? these guys live for that.you think i don &apos;t ?
the only reason you have anything is because of my sweat .
and you knew every step of the way exactly how it works .
but you walk around that fucking mansion
in your $ 500 shoes and your diamond rings
and you act like butter wouldn &apos;t melt in your mouth .
and you don &apos;t want it to get ugly ?
too late .
i want what i am entitled to.you &apos;re entitled to shit .
she &apos;s ready to order .
i guess we get along.we &apos;re just different , you know .
she zigs , i zag . that kind of thing .
what &apos;s her dad like ? he &apos;s always flirting .
he &apos;s ok . a little intense sometimes .
the main thing &apos;s that he &apos;s a good person .
so , you guys gonna get married or what ?
living together &apos;s the same thing .
i lived with a guy once and trust me ,
it &apos;s not even close to being the same thing .
what do you mean ? why ?
cos .
you could just pack up and leave whenever the shit hits the fan .
talk to married people .
that ring , believe it or not , it &apos;s got this kind of , like , weird power .
so , what happened with you and this guy ?
phineas , my boy !
hey .
it &apos;s actually just finn .
so , the cubbies gave your boys a shellacking last night .
it &apos;s still early .
that &apos;s true .

damn right you will.- what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
ask your father .
he stopped paying my bills.daddy ?
you guys looked pretty chummy in the pool that night .
he went home with artie . they helped me clean up .
i have decided to move ahead with the divorce .
what are you gonna do ?
about what ?
life , i don &apos;t know .
what can i do ?
haven &apos;t you thought beyond being dependent on a man ?
it &apos;s so simple for you .
simple for people who don &apos;t expect things to be handed to them .
even finn got a job working construction.good for finn , then .
there are options in life .
isn &apos;t that what you always told me ? you have options .
i have a lawyer .
phineas ! he was just asking . how come a dentist ?
what &apos;s wrong with being a regular doctor ?
i saw this thing on shark teeth as a kid .
hey , phil .

well , you ought to know , sweetie .
what &apos;d you say ?
nothing , what ?
we &apos;re just breaking balls .
finn , what time &apos;s that game tonight ? 8 : 00 , i think .
i &apos;m gonna take a piss .
do me a favour . hold this .
i knew that was coming ! my eye !

these people , your dad &apos;s friends .
i never saw one bit of violence growing up .
what about your dad &apos;s road rage ?
didn &apos;t you tell me you had a boyfriend who was killed ? shot to death ?
first of all , he was killed by drug dealers .
african @-@ americans , if that makes you feel better .
you know you talk about these guys like it &apos;s an anthropology class .
but they bring certain modes of conflict resolution
from all the way back in the old country .
from the poverty of the mezzogiorno , where all higher authority was corrupt .
for the lord jesus christ will change our
mortal bodies to be like his in glory . for he is risen .
the first @-@ born from the dead .
in sure and certain hope of the resurrection
unto eternal life through our lord jesus christ ,
we commend to almighty god our brother joseph ,
and we commit his body to its resting place .
&quot; peeps &quot; ? it &apos;s a fucking nickname .
family name is peparelli .
they &apos;re gonna redo it .
fucking jason ... he &apos;s dyslexic .
what &apos;s that got to do with it ?
ashes to ashes , dust to dust , the lord bless him and keep him .
the lord make his face to shine upon him .
the lord lift up his countenance upon him and give him peace .
in the name of the father , the son and the holy spirit.- amen . - amen .
john .
i &apos;m sorry about the stone . it was a mistake . we &apos;ll fix it .
you remember micky farrell ? dock worker , used to run port newark ?

so what does that mean ? - the night joey bought it ?
you flip your maserati , hit your head ?
you two @-@ faced fuck !

you want to yell at somebody , the man you should be talking to is there .

shake his hand ? - and he kisses the kid &apos;s mother ?
that &apos;s the way it works , you know that .

i don &apos;t want a fuckin &apos; drink .

my cousin could not have been in the city that night cos he was with me .
we were looking for his daughter , john.cos she fuckin &apos; disappeared .
we were upstate , monticello .

chrissy ...
it &apos;s true !
ever since i cleaned up , no matter what he says ,

i can multitask , adriana . i &apos;m not a fucking retard .
it &apos;s always some shit with him .
side deals , secret promises . he &apos;s always got an agenda .
what happened to not sweating the small stuff ?
all i know is i used to be number one cousin .
now i &apos;m being eased aside .
your whole attitude in general .

about interrupting while i &apos;m on the telephone .

i saw him blowing some security guard in the parking lot .
when ? what are you talking about ?
this morning i showed up early .
i didn &apos;t wanna say anything but ... i &apos;m really afraid of this guy .
vito spatafore is a married man , finn.i seriously doubt he wants to kill you .
maybe he wants to fuck me and then kill me .
wait . is that why you got out the suitcase ?
i am not going back to the site .
do you have any idea the strings my father pulled
to get you that job ? and you just fucking quit ? i &apos;m gonna hear so much bullshit !
so it &apos;s all about you , right ?
is that all you can say whenever it &apos;s anything to do with my feelings ?
you &apos;re going back to mission viejo ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
why don &apos;t you just admit it ?
this whole thing ... the fight , the stuff with vito ,
it &apos;s about you not wanting to commit .
i &apos;m here ! we fucking live together ! - but you got out a suitcase !
it &apos;s my process , ok ? look , you never can tell .
your process ? about anything , the future . i was thinking out loud .
well
not out loud , but in the action of getting out the suitcase i was thinking .
thinking of leaving !
no . well , yes.but , i &apos;m still here . i didn &apos;t go.fuck you !
right , great . fuck me .
there was no abundant intentionality in me getting out the suitcase .
i can leave too , you know . my friend hunter &apos;s in montreal .
do i know ? with the french roommate guy
who was all over your ass when we visited .
you don &apos;t think you keep mentioning him every 24 hours at a minimum ?
because he &apos;s thinking of becoming an oral surgeon .
and you might have had a new friend
if you hadn &apos;t been so obnoxious to him at the club !
can we just stop fighting ? you got out a suitcase !
i &apos;ll put it back , ok ?
now batting for the padres ...
so it &apos;s not about us , but suddenly you &apos;re talking about options .
don &apos;t paraphrase what i said .
i said this point in our lives is a transition
period forced on us by external events .
school is over for me.and next year for you .
these are difficult choices . you &apos;d rather
not have choices ? thank god for choices .
stop your bullshit ! it &apos;s really simple .
are we going to stay together or not ?
if you want .
that &apos;s not what i asked !
i said i did.you said
how are we going to keep it together
through four years of dental school for you and med school for me ?
well , it &apos;s a good question .
but why ask it now ? tonight of all times ?
are you asleep ?
no .
you were ! and now you were gonna lie like you did about the suitcase .
i did not lie about the suitcase.then what do you call it ?
i don &apos;t know , i explained it.you should quit the law centre .
you &apos;re like a prosecutor at four am . i can &apos;t think .
how can you sleep in the middle of this ?
in the middle of what ? i said i didn &apos;t wanna go back to the job site
and maybe i should go home until this thing with vito blows over .
but you didn &apos;t ask me to come !
you went to the closet and got out your suitcase !
look , just stop crying , ok ?
why don &apos;t we just get married ?
married ?
let &apos;s get engaged .
really ?
why are you saying that now ?
i can &apos;t think , it &apos;s too late . it &apos;s just something i feel very strongly .
i was wondering when i &apos;d hear from you . i never got your statement .
well , actually that &apos;s why i called.we hit a bit of a snag .
what kind of snag ?
well , i put a call in to phil canter a few days ago , the forensic accountant .
the one with the vending machines .
i didn &apos;t hear from him .
suddenly he called and said he wasn &apos;t interested .
so i called another accountant.and ?
frankly , when he heard your husband was the defendant ,
he demurred as well .
what does this mean ? you don &apos;t want the case ?
well , as my partners reminded me , i do have a full caseload already .
i probably should have mentioned ...
and you were feeling so positive .
i woke up this morning , the depression just washed over me .
you are dissolving a 20 @-@ year marriage .
it &apos;s not my fuckin &apos; goddamn marriage , ok ?
i had another panic attack .
and i thought i had this shit beat ! what happened ?
playing golf with a friend of mine and he was ...
talking about this young guy he knew who passed away .
i guess i became overcome with emotion
cos they had to help me off the tee .
it &apos;s not the first time it &apos;s happened recently .
i wish you had told me.yeah , well , i wish you &apos;d cured it .
when the attacks first reappeared , what was going on in your life ?
you had just rebuffed my affections .
when you passed out were you thinking about me , or ...
i walked into my house and the cleaning girl
was crying on the phone about her cousin
who went off the road in a mexican bus wreck or something .
and i remember just feeling inside
like i wanted to choke her
her cos it was always something with her .
next thing i know , boom !
when did it next happen ?
my cousin tony was up at the house .
he wanted to borrow some tools and they weren &apos;t there .
i was inside talking to carmela
and started to feel that ... you know . and it passed .
your cousin was at your house ? yeah .
tony uncle whatever.uncle al .
and your maid was crying about her cousin .
and the other day at the golf course ...
my cousin entered into that , too .
in what way ?
he hurt his foot .
you were so concerned about your cousin &apos;s foot
you collapsed on the golf course ? i worry about him .
he &apos;s a grown man , isn &apos;t he ?
is he in danger of losing the foot , or ... fuck his foot ! it &apos;s not his foot !
forget the foot !
i worry about him . he &apos;s ... right out of fucking jail , ok ?
all right , look .
the reason he went to prison
is he got pinched hijacking a truckload of betamaxes in &apos; 86 .
they hooked him up on a rico and he got 17 years .
i was supposed to be there the night of the jacking .
i see .
you see .
why didn &apos;t you go ? i was jumped by a bunch of moolinyans .
they were trying to take my shoes . i fought them off ,
but they cut my fuckin &apos; head open ,
the jigaboo cocksucking motherfuckers.ok , forget that .
your cousin went to prison.that &apos;s tremendous guilt to carry .
he went to nam , i was 4f.and that &apos;s the way our friends look at it .
and that &apos;s why you favour tony uncle al ...
and those 17 years , i did so good .
he lost his wife , his daughter .
no wonder you &apos;re having anxiety attacks .
yeah .
maybe if you came clean with him ?
yeah , well ... yeah .
you ok ?
yeah .
go on ... go on ... go on with what you were saying .
are you having an attack now ?
no .
i had a huge lunch , that &apos;s all . it &apos;s gas .
what is it , anthony ?
the night he got pinched i had a fuckin &apos; panic attack .
from my mother , goddamn it !
i didn &apos;t even know what it was then !
just relax .
focus on your breathing.slowly
it &apos;s not that , i just ... i just need some beano or something .
no , just please , focus .
i &apos;ve got my medical bag in case .
black guys , my ass .
i had a fight with my mother and i had a fuckin &apos; panic attack !
ok , forget that for now .
carmela was supposed to come over with some fuckin &apos; yarn
for some bootees my mother was making meadow .
she was late .
what the fuck . why go into it ?
close your eyes.focus on your breathing .
you want some water ?
she was carrying on .
i said to her ... i said , &quot; carmela loves you .
&quot; you gotta understand it , she &apos;s got a three @-@ month @-@ old . &quot;
but she kept fucking ... she kept going and i started screaming at her.so i left
. i walked out the door.i went over to the car , i opened the door , boom !
cut my fucking head open.and your cousin doesn &apos;t know this ?
no , i lied ! what am i gonna tell him ? what am i gonna tell all of them ?
i had a fight with my mother and i fainted ? that &apos;s why i missed the job .
jesus fuckin &apos; christ !
that &apos;s a lot to get off your chest .
i thought i was smart and that &apos;s why i bumped him up and protect him .
turns out i &apos;m just a fuckin&apos;
robot to my own pussy @-@ ass weakness .
he &apos;s also a capable person .
you ok ?
sometimes what happens in here is like taking a shit .
yes , ok .
although i prefer to think of it more like childbirth .
trust me .
it &apos;s like taking a shit .
hello ?
mom ? i &apos;m engaged .
what ?
finn proposed.- we &apos;re getting married
are you sure ?
that &apos;s wonderful , honey . i &apos;m just so surprised !
i ... he &apos;s gonna finish dental school , though , right ?
we &apos;re both finishing school . we won &apos;t marry till we have our degrees .
this is so exciting .
i can &apos;t wait for you to meet his parents .
we &apos;ll have to have a party .
he &apos;s using his graduation present to buy me a ring .
that is so sweet .
i told him he shouldn &apos;t .
