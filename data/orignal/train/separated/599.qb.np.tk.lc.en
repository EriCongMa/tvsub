yeah , rachel and i have been dating for one of your months ,
but our relationship is 12 times more efficient ,
so it &apos;s really been a year .
our sleep cycles are in synch ,
we can communicate with our eyebrows ,
and she knows my netflix password ...
jeff &apos;s netflix password .
damn it . i &apos;m changing that .
i changed it .

so nice to have the edison kids under one roof again .
remember when we used to cut carrots for mom ?
yes .
i need a soda .
oh , okay .
one , two , three .
door &apos;s busted .
landlord &apos;s in jail and money &apos;s tight .
yeah .
oh , my god !
anthony ! thank you !
yeah .
hey , abed , a quick word .
what would you think about my brother moving in with us ?
do i just keep cutting carrots ?
yes , anthony !
he has money . he &apos;s handy .
you &apos;re putting me on the spot .
i guess my knee @-@ jerk concern would be
that he &apos;s a viking and might only use our home
as a temporary base before moving inland
where lumber is more plentiful .
he &apos;s a good guy .
we can &apos;t afford to keep splitting the rent two ways .
you have a better idea ?
how about rachel ?
is that a joke ?
is it cool if i poop ?
no , anthony ! just cut the carrots !
you &apos;ve been dating rachel for a month .
i don &apos;t think you heard his question .
the answer is yes !
rachel and i have been dating for the equivalent of a year .
oh , really ?
&apos;cause i feel like i &apos;ve been hearing about that
for two years .
you can &apos;t just microwave a relationship
like it &apos;s a bean burrito .
annie .
i ain &apos;t living with your month @-@ long girlfriend , brah .
well , i ain &apos;t living with your wack @-@ ass ,
don &apos;t @-@ know @-@ whether- to @-@ keep @-@ cutting @-@ carrots-
or @-@ ask @-@ if @-@ he- can @-@ take @-@ a @-@ poop @-@ brother .
can we discuss this later ?
rachel &apos;s on her way , and i &apos;d like to practice my smile .
i guess it was just air .
why are we organizing a storage room ?
how is this not a janitor &apos;s job ?
can i ask you something ?
why the hell do you have all those muscles
if you &apos;re gonna bitch about moving boxes ?
is the air working in here ?
i &apos;m sweating like a catholic on judgment day .
just a little protestant humor .
i &apos;ve got more .
oh , can &apos;t wait .
nothin &apos; .
wait , there &apos;s something in there blocking the vent .
you gonna open it ?
you do realize nothing good has ever been found
in a vent , right ?
it &apos;s a vent .
intro to chemistry . third edition .
mint .
$ 200 retail .
160 on the street .
why are there books in an air duct ?
why is there hot sauce in the bathroom ?
it &apos;s greendale .
they must be stolen .
we have to tell the dean .
hold on .
let &apos;s just calm down and have a slow , pleasant chat
about possibilities .
what kind ?
all kinds . anything is possible .
we might one day have hover cars .
kale might be poisonous .
and we might not have to get the dean involved here .
jeffrey , these are stolen !
from who ?
by who ? how long ago ?
it &apos;s &quot; from whom , &quot; &quot; by whom . &quot;
but he nailed the third question .
look , we are the committee
that deals with greendale &apos;s problems .
now did you see anything on our list about a pile of missing books
that are worth more than the school they &apos;re hidden in ?
one thing &apos;s for sure .
if we hand these over , they &apos;ll really go missing .
and you think that money &apos;s gonna be used
to cut our paychecks
or to make another rapping peanut costume ?
i can &apos;t believe what i &apos;m hearing .
fine . you wanna go to heaven ?
walk away , more for us .
i &apos;m an accomplice now !
if i walk away ,
i &apos;ll only get into heaven by turning you in .
but what about your restaurant ?
what about your kids ?
ms. bennett , when god talks to you ,
what language does he use ?
because in my experience ,
when he thinks you deserve something ,
he drops it on you like a ton of bricks .
okay .
all right .
but if we &apos;re gonna do this ,
we &apos;re gonna do this clean and safe .
we &apos;re gonna move these to my restaurant in bread carts ,
and we &apos;re gonna sit on &apos; em until we know they &apos;re cold .
then we &apos;re gonna price them through a third party ,
and we &apos;re gonna unload them in a single score .
none of that nickel @-@ and @-@ dime crap .
i don &apos;t wanna leave a trail .
yeah , great .
wonderful .
okay , let &apos;s count these babies up .
yeah , great .
when we were kids ,
anthony and i would play time machine .
we would go ,
&quot; oh , no ! we &apos;re in barbarian times !
quick ! back to the time machine ! &quot;
and then we would run back to the time machine .
it &apos;s true .
i bet that &apos;s why abed is like a brother to me .
you guys are so alike .
i can &apos;t accept that based on one time @-@ machine story .
rachel , did you tell annie about your waterpik ?
i suppose now is as good a time as any .
i own a waterpik .
annie has one too .
you guys both care for your teeth the same amount .
if you shared a bathroom , it &apos;d go pretty smoothly .
anthony said he could fix our cabinets .
rachel used to mop floors when she worked at kmart .
she mops good .
is this a real conversation
or are we being bugged by the feds ?
abed .
sidebar .
what do you think happens after you die ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re lucky .
stop trying to sell me on rachel .
stop pitching anthony so hard .
you &apos;re like ice cream cake out there ... overkill .
we need a roommate . we &apos;re broke .
i vote for rachel .
i vote for anthony .
flip a coin ?
no .
coins create parallel timelines .
rock , paper , scissors ?
that &apos;s a nine @-@ sided coin .
what about pile of bullets ?
you wanna decide on a roommate
with a 1993 old west @-@ themed vcr game ?
if rachel or i win , rachel moves in .
if you or anthony win , i &apos;ll politely surrender
and count down the days until he eats me .
alll right , it &apos;s settled .
is this working ?
it &apos;s a handshake in progress .
who wants to play pile of bullets ?
not me .
you have to .
oh , it &apos;s okay , we don &apos;t have to .
it &apos;s not okay . we do have to .
we all have to , and one day we &apos;ll tell you why .
but for now , let &apos;s simply retire to the tv area .
for the highest stakes 1993 interactive vcr game
of your entire young adult lives .
okay , let &apos;s see what you got .
yeah .
okay .
i know somebody that knows people .
i can get you a price per book , find a buyer , and make a deal .
for half .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
i &apos;m assuming more than half the risk .
half is fair .
not really .
because they &apos;re ours , all 100 % of them .
giving you half is not fair , it &apos;s silly .
okay , good luck .
you wanna re @-@ blindfold me ?
i know we &apos;re in e @-@ 9 in the east wing .
i know that because it smells like weed .
not my weed .
look , i &apos;m willing to give her half .
hear that , britta ?
you can have half of jeff &apos;s share .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re offering by giving her half of the total .
either she can get half of all of our money
or she can get half of your share .
either way , you walk away with about 16 % .
that &apos;s not fair .
damn right .
here &apos;s what is : 25 % for each of us .
take it or leave it , britta .
* legalize it *
* don &apos;t chang @-@ i ... *
hey , guys .
look , if something sketchy is happening ,
i don &apos;t care .
so i &apos;m just gonna back out of the room now and ...
he can &apos;t leave .
no ! no !
i didn &apos;t see anything . i did not see anything !
britta , find some rope .
i &apos;ve got rope .
&quot; each player starts with six bullet tokens ,
ten gold certificates , and a color @-@ coded posse token . &quot;
there &apos;s two types of tokens ?
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll figure it out .
howdy !
you look like a real group of gunslingers .
everyone in town &apos;s mighty scared ,
what with all the gold and the outlaws .
but only one of us can make it out alive .
are we robbing the town ?
by now , you should have your bullets , your gold ,
and two wild west tokens each .
hang onto those tokens no matter what .
there &apos;s two kinds of tokens .
two each ?
now when you hear the word &quot; draw , &quot;
or when you see a square with a color or number matching
one of you or your opponent &apos;s cards ,
the first one of you to say , &quot; bang , &quot;
wins the challenged player &apos;s token
and the amount of their bid in gold !
what &apos;s going on ?
shh !
ready ?
yes ?
i &apos;m not .
shh !
are we supposed to be bidding ?
draw !
i bid !
pow ! bang !
rattler !
bang ! 5 !
bang ?
yee @-@ haw !
bang @-@ bang ! 5 !
bang ?
not bad !
collect your tokens and let &apos;s get on to the next round !
what are you doing ? stop that .
he said , &quot; collect your tokens . &quot;
he can &apos;t see you .
didn &apos;t abed shoot whoever &apos;s 5 ?
draw !
bang ! bang ! bang !
odd @-@ numbered players , give up two cards !
draw !
we have numbers ?
bang , bang , bang , bang , bang , bang .
okay , okay , i don &apos;t think we &apos;re doing this right .
are we sure this is a game and not some art film ?
now what do we do ?
we rewind it and start over .
okay , i &apos;ll allow it .
no , it &apos;s okay .
we gave it our best shot , no ?
i &apos;m sorry , rachel , is this your home ?
oh , god , no , i &apos;m sorry .
well , this is what we &apos;re playing .
but it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
oh ! it sounds like anthony wants to forfeit .
he doesn &apos;t . don &apos;t forfeit , anthony .
rachel , we can do this .
just focus , okay ?
okay ...
howdy !
howdy !
i love textbooks .

you gotta make it sound believable
or you &apos;re not getting outta here .
i &apos;m trying .

i love textbooks .
that &apos;s why i stole them .
look at this one .
stolen textbooks are the best kind .
i stole all these books and put &apos; em in this room
so i could come kiss them .

i can &apos;t let you leave until we &apos;re done with this deal .
shirley , this is not what god wants you to be doing today !
we had our chance to think about that .
he dropped this on us like a ton of bricks .
right , hickey ?
oh , yeah , definitely .
not to say that this isn &apos;t getting insane .
blackhat bill sure ain &apos;t the forgivin &apos; type .

abed , i think you &apos;re having one of your special times , okay ?
so i &apos;m gonna give you some space .
i don &apos;t want space . i want you to move in here .
what ?
but that &apos;s not resolved !
anthony might move in , so ...
what ?
we want one of you to live with us .
yeah , we &apos;re settling it with a game of pile of bullets .
that is not an explanation
that should make anybody want to live here .
abed , i don &apos;t like this side of you ,
and i do not like that side of vcr technology .
i am glad that it &apos;s a dead medium .
that was very uncomfortable .
i don &apos;t really know how girlfriends work ,
but i don &apos;t think you have one anymore .
okay , cool . see you there .
i &apos;m meeting my guy in an hour .
he wants to see a sample , set a price ,
and then we &apos;ll do the exchange .
oh , brother .
so britta doesn &apos;t know how much she &apos;s getting from
this guy that none of us will ever see again .
but she knows one thing for sure :
she &apos;ll be right back with it so you can divvy it up ,
even steven .
oh , man , that is rich .
what &apos;s supposed to stop her from robbing you guys blind ?
what are you gonna do , call the cops ?
i &apos;ll go with her .
oh , yeah . good plan .
yeah , leave hickey here , and the two of you do the deal .
yeah , what the hell ?
when did i volunteer for guantanamo duty
while you two traipse off to the cuban equivalent of las vegas ?
havana , right ?
guys , don &apos;t listen to jeff . he &apos;s just trying to divide us .
says the woman who &apos;s willing to take care of the cash by herself .
as if you &apos;re mr. trustworthy .
why do you have so much access to rope ?
hey , you &apos;re the one who left the door unlocked
so chang could get in here .
how do i know you didn &apos;t do that on purpose ?
guys . guys !
calm down .
i &apos;m sure we can work this out .
we just need to stay cool and talk it through .
i &apos;m sorry .
that didn &apos;t work out the way i planned .
i &apos;m sorry .
but you didn &apos;t leave me any choice .
you were acting very poorly ,
i didn &apos;t know if i could trust you anymore !
you dragged me into this .
i didn &apos;t want this .
you &apos;re packing ?
yeah .
you &apos;re leaving ?
yeah .
because of last night ?
yeah .
i just think there &apos;s some unresolved issues here .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m still really hurt
by mom turning her back on me when i went to rehab .
and i guess part of me was mad at you for siding with her ,
so i thought you moving in here
was some kind of moral victory .
what ? no .
i mean unresolved issues
involving the black guy in all these photographs .
troy ?
hey , i don &apos;t know his name , man .
i just know he &apos;s clearly left some kind of vacuum .
and screw you . what did i have to do with mom ?
i was 13 .
i &apos;m here to do my third @-@ act apology .
abed , i don &apos;t think ... - wait .
don &apos;t reject it until the whole thing &apos;s been served up .
dobry .
open your locker please .
i wanna tell you something .
abed , this is adorable .
just because it &apos;s adorable doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s not important .
listen .
i &apos;ve been accelerating our relationship
because i &apos;ve been worried i wouldn &apos;t pass a lot of the tests .
i wanted you to move in because i thought
if annie was around , i &apos;d have less chance of screwing things up .
you &apos;re not screwing things up , though .
that &apos;s good to know .
but the problem with me will always be
that i can never know for sure .
there &apos;s not a huge amount of people in my life
that haven &apos;t eventually kicked me out ,
and i don &apos;t always see it coming .
i don &apos;t want it to happen with you .
well , don &apos;t manipulate me and don &apos;t keep secrets from me
and we &apos;ll probably be okay .
cool .
it stopped raining .
yeah , it sure did .
aww , you hired a stunt person .
no , i did not .
where &apos;d you get these ?
they were an inheritance from my father .
he was a collector .
mm @-@ hmm .
how many ?
120 .
well , for the whole bunch , maybe 20 .
thousand ?
dollars .
$ 20,000 ?
20 non @-@ thousand dollars .
20 regular dollars .
you might get that from a recycling place .
these are misprints , honey .
check out page 105 .
well , i can &apos;t because there &apos;s no page numbers .
ah ! well , that would be a problem .
you know , &quot; class , turn to page ... &quot;
there is no page ...
oh , well , if there &apos;s no page number ,
you can &apos;t turn to it .
i &apos;ve better things to do with my life .
although we haven &apos;t been saying it ,
troy was an important part of our apartment .
he kept the peace .
yeah .
goin &apos; a little crazy without him .
maybe we need to live with a therapist .
or at least someone crazier than us .
let &apos;s give craigslist another try .
i think craigslist is the way to go .
are you guys all wearing the same clothes from yesterday ?
we &apos;ve been through some stuff .
but we learned something .
no , we didn &apos;t .
we learned that sometimes there &apos;s no lesson .
how is that learning ?
we played pile of bullets .
can we just get this meeting over with ?
so how &apos;d the cleanup go ?
i learned how to smile .
don &apos;t step , don &apos;t step to me .
i like coffee and water , don &apos;t step to me .
uh , damn it ! i lost it .
i lost it !
okay . i will get back to you .
who was that , sweetie ?
guess they want me for that
wild west videotape board game thing .
pile of bullets ?
yeah .
devin , you pick up that phone right now
and you call these people
and you tell &apos; em you want this part .
these vcr games is where everything is headed .
can &apos;t you see that ?
you just became the luke skywalker of the new star wars .
we &apos;ve gotta move .
we do ?
oh , yes , indeedy .
we have got to move to los angeles .
but i work here .
oh , please .
you call apple computers work ?
what kind of company offers stock options
as a christmas bonus ?
that ship is sinkin &apos; .
sweetie ,
remember when we were talkin &apos; about trying cocaine ?
yeah ...
i think we should start looking for some right now .
because we &apos;re gonna be able to afford it .
okay . i mean , if you &apos;re sure .
i &apos;ve never been more sure about anything in my entire life .
pile of bullets .
pile of bullets .
oh , yes !
