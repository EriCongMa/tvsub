grounded or not grounded , you &apos;re not old enough to date .
name &apos;s asher , and i do go to unity .

bad enough to try to kill himself .
oh , my god , georgina .
what are you doing here ?
well , i told you i was coming .
didn &apos;t you get my gifts ?
what &apos;s georgina got on you ?
dan i understand , but what &apos;s so bad you can &apos;t even tell me ?

spotted ... jenny jenny humphrey wading in the met fountain ,
fishing for change ...
blair waldorf , seen dallying with an off @-@ duty doorman
at the blarney stone on a monday night .
it looks like the battle
between the queen b. and little j .
has moved from the streets to the blogs .
who &apos;s sending this debasing dish ?
i have a feeling ...
a nice , shiny dime to add to your collection .
why the fruit cup , b . ? lost your taste for yogurt ?
so what are we doing tonight ?
asher &apos;s parents are in cannes ,
so he and jenny are throwing a party at his house .
it &apos;s a really small get @-@ together with just our closest friends .
sorry , blair .
blair can take my place. invitations are nontransferable .
she &apos;s new to the group .
just because your name &apos;s on the invite
doesn &apos;t make you a hostess .
oh ! then why is the party planner calling me ?
excuse me , girls .
hey , dad ?
i &apos;m kinda busy. what &apos;s up ?
i was just wondering what time you want me to serve
your favorite home @-@ cooked meal tonight. maybe around 8 : 00 ?
oh , um , i have that choir thing .
remember , i talked to you about it ,
and you said i could go cause i &apos;ve been good ? oh , right .
well , maybe we could wait to eat till after you got home then .
you &apos;re gonna be hungry after all that singing. yeah , well , i mean ,
they have food there , and it &apos;s probably gonna go pretty late .
so , um ... tomorrow ? okay , love you .
love you , too .
sorry. floral emergency .
oh , and you will be happy to know
that the entire unity lacrosse team r.s.v.p. &apos; d !
hi ! oh , my god. it &apos;s asher .
let &apos;s go say hi .
how did little jenny humphrey become the next brooke astor ?
the same way they all do. marry up .
hey , why the long face ?
are you still sad mom wouldn &apos;t let you go
to monte carlo for the bachelor party ? no , i &apos;m fine .
i figured i &apos;d let bart , chuck and prince albert
have their fun ... oh , that didn &apos;t come out like i meant it .
um ... gossip girl. looks like jenny &apos;s been spotted at gap
sewing stella mccartney labels into pocket ts .
these rumors are getting to be ridiculous .
oh , like the one where i &apos;m gossip girl. hey , it made sense at the time .
it never made any sense .
yeah , it did ! it did ! yeah , it did. no , it didn &apos;t .
wait , hold on. it &apos;s chuck . i have something to do before school starts ,
but tell him i say hi. okay. don &apos;t forget about dinner tonight .
yeah. salut , chuck .
yes , i &apos;m still fine .
i haven &apos;t heard from georgina in two weeks .
so if you &apos;d stop calling me ,
i &apos;d finally be rid of all of my monsters. bye .
you can read about it all day long ,
but you have to walk the city to know it .
okay , but look ,
anything is better than getting lost on the train every day. subway .
click those heels all you want. you &apos;re not in portland anymore .
seriously , you and dan are so sweet to adopt me .
i @-@ i &apos;d be a mess without you guys .
well , more of a mess than i already am .
red eye to go ? yes , please. thank you. hey , sarah .
sorry for talking your ear off the other night , guys. he tends to ramble ,
as you &apos;ll get to know .
yeah .
well , i &apos;m a good listener , as he &apos;ll get to know .
are there any new developments ?
uh , no. no , more of the same .
jenny and her boyfriend are still inseparable ,
and she &apos;s even more insufferable .
give her a break . asher &apos;s her first love .
it &apos;s infatuation. it &apos;s not love. yeah , but to a 15 @-@ year @-@ old girl ,
i mean , there really isn &apos;t a difference .
and how long did it take you , dan ? um ... that &apos;s a little different ,
vanessa .
it took me-- uh , one glance at a ninth grade birthday party ?
yes , but two years to obsess over it. so things are better with ...
serena ? serena. yeah. yeah , good memory .
right. things are finally back to normal .
good. well , i mean ...
you know , it &apos;s--it &apos;s tough making friends in a new city .
it &apos;d be really nice to meet her. yeah , serena would love you .
she loves everybody. not that she would only like you
because she doesn &apos;t discriminate. um ... ahem .
see what she meant about that rambling thing ?
how &apos;s tonight ?
tonight would be perfect .
good. see you .
be right back .
okay .
oh , my god !
he &apos;s so cute !
hey , can i talk to you for a minute ?
sure. is something wrong ?
that &apos;s what i was gonna ask you. where have you been lately ?
you haven &apos;t returned any of my calls. sorry .
it &apos;s been harder than i thought to keep up with schoolwork
and the new spring social calendar
and my new boyfriend. yeah . asher , right ?
yeah. he &apos;s cute and smart and basically perfect ,
and the best part is i think he really likes me. well ,
then he has good taste .
but ... how well do you actually know him ?
oh , that &apos;s so sweet. you &apos;re being protective. no , i &apos;m not .
but ... yes. yes , i am . i &apos;ve got nothing against him . i just ...
something about him
makes me feel maybe he &apos;s not the right guy for you .
oh , my god. wait. do you have a crush on me or something ? no , i don &apos;t .
i just want you--
don &apos;t be embarrassed. it &apos;s cute .
i mean , and not so unexpected , actually . i &apos;m flattered .
it &apos;s just ... my heart belongs to asher .
i actually gotta go , but , um , text me , &apos; kay ?
oh. bye .
hey , are you okay ? yeah .
what ? you &apos;re here !
mmm ! and you &apos;re late .
mm , i know . i come bearing apologies and an invitation .
what are you up to tonight ? i know what i &apos;m not up to-- having fun .
the s.a.t. tutor was over for four hours last night .
mm. so this tutor , is he--is he cute ?
mm , well , if hair in the ears is your thing ...
i hate that since i &apos;m not gonna
use the score chuck bought for me ,
i have to study every night .
i can &apos;t even be distracted by that--
i see your point. so then how about , um ,
dinner tonight with sarah instead ?
oh , sarah again ?
what is she , your new girlfriend or something ? yeah. just kidding .
but she &apos;s new in town , and she does want to meet you .
well , since bart and chuck are out of town ,
i already agreed to a quiet family dinner in our old suite .
i &apos;m sorry. what about tomorrow ? no , my--my sister and tongue .
the two things that don &apos;t go together so well. oh ! lighten up .
you have been down on him since the beginning .
give him a chance and then judge .
maybe he &apos;ll surprise you , like i did .
how are you always so right ? it &apos;s easy whenyou &apos;realways wrong .
hey , you got first period free .
why don &apos;t you go get to know him ? go ! okay. okay. all right , okay .
and the only thing
more shocking than the truth ...
are the lies people tell
to cover it up .
when you revise the seating chart ,
don &apos;t forget to place mr . spitzer
as far away from serena &apos;s table
as possible .
thank you .
ugh. what is not on the schedule today ?
i don &apos;t think i am .
maybe you could fit me in between
preston bailey and sylvia weinstock ?
well , good luck fitting anything between those two .
what--what are you doing here ? well , believe it or not ,
i &apos;m here to see you .
well , i have a laundry list of things to do today. it &apos;s about jenny .
alison &apos;s away on an artists &apos; retreat ,
and i could really use a mother &apos;s advice .
i think i might be in over my head .
i suppose we could talk about it on the way .
what &apos;s going on ? see you later .
hey , asher. how &apos;s it going ? you got a minute ?
yeah. uh , but just a minute . jenny and i have a lunch date .
well , look , there &apos;s no easy way to say this , honestly ,
so i &apos;m just gonna-- i &apos;m just gonna say it .
i @-@ i , uh , saw you this morning .
saw me what ? i saw you ... you know , i saw you kissing that guy .
you got the wrong person. come on , man. i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t think i do .
are you calling me queer ? that &apos;s ... not at all what i said .
you wanna know how queer i am ?
i &apos;m so queer ,
i &apos;m gonna pop your sister &apos;s cherry tonight .
hey ! what &apos;d you say ? !
what are you doing ? stop it ! jenny , i need to talk to you in private .
well , anything you have to say to me ,
you can say in front of my boyfriend. re--okay. all right , fine .
your boyfriend is not being honest with you . i wasn &apos;t gonna tell you yet ,
but i ...
wanted to invite you to the country house this weekend .
your brother thought we were moving too fast and got upset .
dan , can &apos;t you just let me be happy for once ?
jenny , i want you to be happy. just not with a guy who--
yeah , i understand that you &apos;re threatened by him ,
because clearly he &apos;s everything you wanna be .
he &apos;s good @-@ looking and worldly , a legacy at dartmouth .
but even you should know
that jealousy clashes with l.l.bean pants .
it &apos;s a snub from one party , b .
plus what &apos;s the big deal anyway ? you don &apos;t even like asher .
i didn &apos;t like last season &apos;s
louis vuitton patchwork bag either , but that doesn &apos;t mean
i want to see it all over town on jenny humphrey &apos;s arm. touch ?
what do you say we have a girls &apos; night out tonight ? oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t . i have dinner with the family .
let me remind you of a little promise you made .
&quot; don &apos;t go to france . i &apos;ll be there for you . &quot;
i &apos;m really sorry i &apos;ve been distant ,
but things will be better soon , i promise. obviously starting tomorrow .
what &apos;s wrong ? you look stressed , even for you .
i &apos;m still worried about jenny .
you mean because she &apos;s self @-@ obsessed ,
self @-@ serving , self @-@ centered , self--
no. no , i wish it was about her and herself ,
but it &apos;s more about who she &apos;s with .
i can &apos;t get through to her .
i tried , and she just completely blew me off ,
and she dissed my pants .
maybe i underestimated her .
she &apos;s just going through a phase. we all went through it .
and apparently , some of us still are in it .
all that matters to someone like jenny right now
are the four g &apos;s--guys , girlfriends and gossip girl .
it &apos;s true. don &apos;t feel bad .
unless it &apos;s coming from one of them ,
she &apos;s not gonna hear it .
here we go .
ah , thank you .
i tell her she can &apos;t see asher. she calls him .
i take away her phone. they &apos;re on ichat .
how do you keep them from growing up
when they can have a full relationship
from the confines of their own bedrooms ? well , the answer is you can &apos;t .
she &apos;s gonna grow up no matter what . i read her e @-@ mail .
well , you can &apos;t be too concerned about their privacy
when their well @-@ being is at stake ,
especially if you think they &apos;re lying to you. was she ? right to my face .
i know serena went through a similar phase .
well , if serena &apos;s indiscretions were as p.g. as jenny &apos;s ,
i wouldn &apos;t have needed the botox .
dan was so much easier .
well , raising girls is different .
serena would be a horrible monster for a hundred days ,
and then on the 101st ,
she &apos;d be my little girl again .
so i just wait and hope , huh ?
well , that &apos;s the hardest part .
you have to trust that you &apos;ve done your job .
she &apos;ll come back to you .
that &apos;s ...
it &apos;s perfect .
beautiful. it &apos;s my finest piece. mm @-@ hmm .
here .
let me .
mark ingram , it &apos;s beautiful .
you &apos;ve outdone yourself. oh , wow .
oh , wow .
this just in--
asher hornsby spotted locking lips before class ...
but not with his girlfriend .
looks like gentlemen don &apos;t prefer blondes , little j .
they prefer other gentlemen .
now you know how vanessa hudgens feels .
is this just another round of blanks
fired between b. and little j . ?
i &apos;m tired of being the bearer of bad grudges .
this is the last item that goes to press without proof .
i &apos;m so glad gossip girl finally got her balls back .
yeah , she was totally turning into the new &quot; page six . &quot;
low blow. wasn &apos;t me. wish it was .
hello ? miss van derwoodsen ?
it &apos;s luke from the concierge &apos;s desk .
you asked that we call first
before delivering anything upstairs ? is there something for me ?
yes , a package from a miss georgina sparks .
hello ? did i lose you ?
uh , no. uh , just keep it there .
i &apos;ll pick it up right after school .
and don &apos;t let it out of your sight .
of course. thank you .
what was that about ? nothing. it &apos;s just this ...
nothing . i &apos;ll see you later , okay ? bye .
bye. hey ...
hey , b .
dan humphrey--just who i hate to admit i was looking for .
you &apos;re dirty .
wha--uh , what are you talking about ?
cheating , drinking , drugs-- it &apos;s all fair game .
but outing your sister &apos;s boyfriend is dark .
how did squeaky @-@ clean humphrey even come up with that ?
i didn &apos;t come up with anything. oh , my god .
you know something. spill it .
yeah , i @-@ i might have seen asher kissing another guy .
so it &apos;s true ? who was he kissing ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t know . i couldn &apos;t see .
but what does that even matter ? right now gossip girl &apos;s credibility is
the same as tinsely mortimer &apos;s after a few martinis .
but if i can prove that his duplicity
is more than just a rumor , then they &apos;ll break up .
that &apos;s what you want , isn &apos;t it ? well , yeah , i guess. yeah--
asher &apos;s just using your sister as a cover .
it &apos;s your brotherly duty to save her from becoming
the next katie holmes. and you &apos;re in this to help jenny ?
motive is irrelevant as long as our endgame is the same. no , blair ,
this is not a game to me , okay ? i don &apos;t want her to get hurt. well ,
you should &apos;ve thought that through
before you told all of manhattan that jenny &apos;s a glorified hag .
you know what ? i--you &apos;re on your own .
i &apos;m done .
suit yourself .
lly , rufus. what were you thinking ?
you threw her a surprise birthday party
and had her face painted on a cake with a tiara ?
it seemed like a good idea at the time .
yeah , well , so did flannel and acid @-@ washed jeans ,
but they weren &apos;t flattering either .
what is it ?
is it too much ?
uh , is it not enough ?
it &apos;s not the dress. it &apos;s you in it .
i &apos;m sorry . i thought ...
i didn &apos;t mean ...
we &apos;re here as friends , right ?
no , we are friends .
it &apos;s just how you look .
nothing new on &quot; gossip girl &quot; for three hours .
guess she wasn &apos;t kidding about her new standards. hey , jenny !
oh ! sorry , i can &apos;t chat ,
but have so much fun at your party tonight .
she &apos;s totally running to a booty call with your brother .
i cannot believe you just went there. and where have you gone , little j . ?
yeah , you and asher. how far ? far enough .
playing coy only means one thing. maybe asher doesn &apos;t like girls .
is that why we went to third ? you went to third ?
no , he did .
well done. make him work for it .
whoever said that money doesn &apos;t buy happiness
didn &apos;t know where to shop .
lucky for me , i may have to go out tonight after all .
did you get it ? lucky for you , is knows five ways to sneak into
the unity boys &apos; locker room , and six to sneak out .
asher takes an abnormally long shower after practice .
maybe his lacrosse stick
isn &apos;t the only thing he likes to play with .
why &apos;d you want his phone so badly anyway ? it was once said
that a person &apos;s eyes are the windows to their soul .
that was before people had cell phones .
this is a surprise .
party &apos;s not for a couple hours .
yeah , well , a lot can happen in a couple hours .
uh , jenny .
what are you doing ? what &apos;s wrong ?
it--nothing &apos;s wrong .
this ... it just isn &apos;t what we do .
are you suddenly ...
not happy ? i ...
i &apos;m holding up my end of the bargain .
what bargain ?
you &apos;re jenny humphrey from brooklyn .
you need status , access , resources .
i give that to you. what do i give you ?
do we really need to talk about this ?
yeah. yeah , yeah , we do .
so what was on &quot; gossip girl &apos;s &quot; true ?
do you really think someone like me
would just date someone like you ?
but you &apos;ve been so nice .
and i &apos;ll keep being nice. nothing has to change , okay ?
asher ...
come on , jenny .
tonight you &apos;re hosting
your first upper east side party .
that &apos;s something that blair and those girls
can never take away from you .
i know. thank you .
you &apos;re welcome. and ...
there is something you can do to show your thanks .
i think it would be better for both of us
if we put those rumors to rest once and for all .
what do you want me to do ?
if you put the camera here ,
she &apos;ll never know. are you sure she &apos;s gonna be down for this ?
it &apos;s serena. she goes down for anything .
so how &apos;s the new mr. and mrs. shepherd ?
i just did something so stupid .
it &apos;s hot . i &apos;m too hot .
you &apos;re hot .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
i can &apos;t talk right now , mom . i &apos;ll explain later .
if you invite an old friend to our quiet family dinner ,
i expect you to stay and eat .
you know how i always loved when georgina came around .
i ran into lily in the lobby .
you totally forgot to tell her i was coming over for dinner .
did you get my present ?
breaking news--
asher hornsby overheard bragging
that little j. swiped her &quot; v &quot; card at his register .
jenny , is this true ?
it &apos;s private .
it &apos;s on the internet. yeah , well , it &apos;s none of your business .
and since when
did you start reading &quot; gossip girl &quot; blasts anyway ?
since you became the subject of them .
you &apos;re 15 years old , and i &apos;m your big brother .
it is my business. well , it &apos;s not true .
you happy ? oh. w--
you can &apos;t tell anyone , though. everyone has to believe it .
w--are--are you saying
that you actually want your friends to think
that you &apos;re sleeping with a guy who &apos;s gay ?
do you believe everything that you read on &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
i didn &apos;t read it . i saw it .
so you were the one who sent the tip ? yeah , i &apos;m--look , i &apos;m sorry ,
but i tried to tell you. you wouldn &apos;t listen to me .
i needed to get your attention somehow .
well , i knew about him the whole time .
so ... so you let him use you ?
well , maybe i was using him. did you ever think of that ?
for once in your life ,
could you just stop judging everyone ? no , i &apos;m not . i &apos;m--
you think that you &apos;re so different and so good ?
well , guess what , dan ?
the minute that you start sending tips to gossip girl ,
you &apos;re in the game with the rest of us .
b. , now &apos;s not a good time .
it &apos;s important. look , i know i told you i &apos;d be more available ,
but i just can &apos;t right now. but it can &apos;t wait .
sorry. it was just blair .
oh. how is snow white ?
uh , snow not so white. did you hear that she and-- eric .
so , georgina , what brings you back to new york ?
oh , i just had some time to kill .
she went to boarding school in switzerland .
oh , your parents must be happy you &apos;re back. oh , no .
actually , they &apos;ve moved to the country full @-@ time .
i &apos;m just in the city to catch up with some old friends .
what about you ?
you and that gorgeous tiffany rock
seem to be the talk of the city. thank you .
mr. bass and i are very , um , happy .
you look it. you all do .
i mean , there must be love in the new york air .
you &apos;re engaged , serena &apos;s found a new guy ,
eric found himself a boyfriend .
excuse me ?
oh , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t think i heard you right .
what ? you haven &apos;t met serena &apos;s new guy ? a boyfriend ?
oh. you mean eric .
you didn &apos;t know he was dating someone ?
i ... didn &apos;t think it was a secret .
i mean , i saw them kissing in front of st. jude &apos;s this morning
for all the world to see .
well , don &apos;t look so embarrassed , e .
he is a hot piece ! well done .
please , georgina. it &apos;s not funny , okay ?
you--you didn &apos;t know eric was dating a boy .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense , because that would mean ...
that eric is ...
and he &apos;s not .
he &apos;s just not .
are you ?
oh , god .
eric .
great , mom. that &apos;s just great .
how dare you ?
dan went out with vanessa , and i &apos;m going to choir practice
like we talked about. don &apos;t wait up. not so fast .
where were you gonna change your clothes ?
we don &apos;t wear a uniform for rehearsal .
well , unless the choir is entertainment at asher &apos;s party ,
you have some explaining to do .
how &apos;d you know about the party ?
i know a lot more than you think i do .
nice dress .
i wanted one night out , okay ? what was i supposed to do ?
ask my permission .
well , you would &apos;ve said no. you &apos;re probably right ,
but that &apos;s no excuse to lie to me. dad , you don &apos;t understand , all right ?
i &apos;m throwing this party ! not anymore you &apos;re not .
you need to call asher and tell him you &apos;re not coming . i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s too late , all right ?
all my friends-- you heard me .
i promised. all that good behavior from the past few weeks
just got wiped out from that lie. you can &apos;t stop me , all right ? i &apos;m going .
jenny , if you walk out that door , i--
you &apos;ll what ? ! what , dad ? what are you gonna do ?
are you gonna put bars on my window
or chain me to the kitchen counter ?
i &apos;m not your ...
i &apos;m not a little girl anymore .
you can &apos;t make me do anything .
you &apos;ve already lost my trust .
you really wanna lose my respect , too ?
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah. okay .
hey , it &apos;s me .
bye .
who are you talking to ?
chuck .
what , you called chuck ?
yeah . i &apos;ve been talking to him a lot lately .
guy &apos;s got his faults , but he &apos;s never judged me .
i &apos;m your sister .
we &apos;re us .
you can tell me anything .
i wanted to ,
but it ... it &apos;s--it &apos;s not the type of thing
you blurt out on the way to school .
i was waiting for the right time .
dinner with georgina definitely wasn &apos;t at all .
i &apos;sorry about her ...
about me .
i came back for you ,
and then i abandoned you all over again .
this isn &apos;t like before .
i &apos;m fine , really .
well , i &apos;m here now .
when i was at ostroff , i met this guy .
we were going through a lot of the same stuff ,
and now that guy is dating jenny .
wait , you &apos;re the mystery guy that asher was spotted kissing ?
i know this isn &apos;t how you wanted this to happen .
yeah , i guess the important thing
is that it &apos;s happening .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
i love you , no matter ...
what you do , who you like ,
whose boyfriend kisses you .
the people who care about you
will always stand by your side , okay ? yeah .
i think i &apos;m gonna drop by asher &apos;s party .
there &apos;s one more person i have to talk to .
oh , my god. blair crashed jenny &apos;s party .
you look ... i know .
jenny &apos;s gonna freak. watch and learn , ladies .
the most important parties to attend
are the ones you &apos;re not invited to .
where &apos;s the host ? i have something for him .
oh , thank god you &apos;re here . i &apos;m so happy to see you. hey .
i &apos;m happy to see you , too. you can meet sarah. oh , i &apos;d love to ,
but now is really not a good time .
well , she &apos;s here , so , uh ... sarah , serena. serena , sarah .
hi . i &apos;m sarah .
it is so nice to finally meet you .
dan told me you were pretty , but he didn &apos;t do you justice .
dan , can we talk in private , please ? hey , no , no , no. wait .
to show me one of her movies .
i &apos;m a filmmaker , too , of sorts .
actually , i brought one of my short films .
i was hoping to get your opinion .
maybe you wanna see it , too , and tell me what you think ?
i &apos;ll go get my laptop .
dan , would you get me a coffee ? please ?
yeah .
what the hell are you doing , georgina ? put that away .
aw , come on . i &apos;m just having a little fun .
remember ? like old times .
you and me pretending to be different people--
svetlana and savannah. this is not a game .
i don &apos;t know how you even filmed that ,
but i &apos;m not playing with you this time. it &apos;s just a friendly game .
but we &apos;re not friends .
oh ... i think we are .
you see , because with me as your enemy ,
dan sees this .
and if the heavy petting doesn &apos;t send him running ,
well , i &apos;ll bet what happened after will. hey .
what &apos;d we miss ? nothing .
it &apos;s like sarah and i have known each other for years .
oh. great .
we don &apos;t need the laptop anymore. thanks .
no , i got a little shy about showing it .
maybe next time ?
okay .
so was it as special as you hoped it would be ?
cause yours totally wasn &apos;t. and yours was ?
ladies , your drinks .
i mean , yeah .
asher made me feel really safe. you are so lucky .
mmm , i know .
you guys , blair is here. what is she doing here ? she wasn &apos;t invited .
we need to talk .
give us a moment , guys .
i thought you might want this back .
whatever you found , it &apos;s not what it looks like .
it &apos;s always what it looks like .
and judging by the texts and photos ,
it looks like a little more than friendship .
what are you gonna do with them ?
well , lucky for you ,
your friend is someone i actually care about ,
or i would &apos;ve used them against you and jenny already .
too bad you don &apos;t care about him the same way .
it &apos;s okay , blair . i can handle this .
what &apos;s he doing here ? what is she doing here ?
are you gonna tell her , or am i ? there &apos;s nothing to tell .
gossip girl was right .
asher was kissing someone this morning ... me. oh !
he &apos;s totally lying. tell him , jenny .
i was with you all morning .
yeah. asher &apos;s right .
i was with him. eric &apos;s lying .
why would i stand here , in front of everyone we know ,
and tell them if it wasn &apos;t true ?
i &apos;m gay ...
and so are you .
get this faggot out of here !
go ahead and do it .
what did you just do ?
you &apos;ll see .
what kind of mother does not know that her son is gay ?
the people you know best
are the ones most capable of surprising you .
the things that i said , the way i acted ...
it was not my finest maternal moment .
what if he does something again ?
i know how much you love him. so does he .
you just need to remind him of that .
but what if it &apos;s not enough ? most of the time , it &apos;s all we &apos;ve got .
and what about you ? what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna wait for my daughter to come to me ,
and then i &apos;m gonna ground her until she &apos;s 25 .
ah , we make quite the team , huh ?
always did .
good luck , lil ,
with everything .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll make a beautiful bride .
mm , thank you .
good night , rufus .
weekend update--
a same @-@ sex kiss hasn &apos;t caused this much controversy
since britney and madonna .
looks like little j. didn &apos;t spread her legs after all .
she spread lies instead .
asher is gay ,
and i have the correspondence to prove it .
looks like someone needs a semester in france .
get your things , girls. we &apos;re leaving .
guys , we can still have fun. don &apos;t leave .
it &apos;s kind of hard to party after the gay bomb drops .
i &apos;m gonna do something out of character
and give you the benefit of the doubt .
tells us gossip girl is wrong .
did you or did you not sleep with asher ?
i ... may have exaggerated a little bit .
dating a gay guy is an honest mistake ,
but lying to your girlfriends about sex is unforgivable .
to think ,
i almost asked you to wear a matching dress tonight .
you &apos;re branded now with the &quot; l &quot; word .
&quot; liar . &quot;
so what are we doing tonight ?
we are doing nothing .
i , however , am going home .
but , um ...
tomorrow , dinner at the waverly
and then to 151 for drinks. yeah .
i &apos;ll have dorota blackberry everyone an itinerary .
don &apos;t look so sad , little j .
the sun will come out tomorrow ...
even though your boyfriend did today .
hey , um , i made ...
uh , some tea .
um , it &apos;s probably iced now , but , um ...
look , my reaction earlier-- it &apos;s okay , mom .
no , it &apos;s not okay .
you just caught me off guard . i guess i ...
i just wasn &apos;t ready .
well , i wasn &apos;t ready either , so ...
it &apos;s okay if you need time .
since you &apos;re being so honest ,
i &apos;m gonna , um , to try as well , okay ?
i &apos;m scared .
and life is tough enough as it is , you know ?
i want ... i want the best for you .
i &apos;m worried for your safety and your happiness .
i have a better chance of being happy if i &apos;m honest .
i know that ,
and i want you to know what love is ...
whoever you &apos;re with ,
because it &apos;s pretty great .
you would know , right ?
fourth time &apos;s the charm .
ah , yes ,
the truth always comes out .
it &apos;s one of the fundamental rules of time .
and when it comes out , it can set you free ...
or end everything you fought so hard for .
my , my. if it isn &apos;t little j . , risen from the ashes .
i came to tell you in person ...
you win .
oh , sweetie. we just started to play .
no , you don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;m done ...
with you , with them ,
with all of it .
just like that , you wave the white flag ?
i lied , and i stole ,
and i lost the respect of my family ... for what ?
so i can be like you ?
you asked me before if it was all worth it .
my answer is , it &apos;s not .
i tried to warn you ...
there &apos;s a price to pay .
i always knew a girl like you couldn &apos;t afford it .
well , you were right .
well , you put up a good fight ...
for a freshman .
thanks .
i hope you don &apos;t expect a hug .
i don &apos;t expect anything anymore .
so ... she &apos;s great , right ? what do you think ?
honestly , there &apos;s something i don &apos;t really like about her .
okay , but you had your doubts about vanessa in the beginning ,
and now you guys are friends. this is different .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand why you--you &apos;re ...
why i &apos;m what ?
jealous. there &apos;s no reason to be .
she--she actually wanted us to patch things up .
what , you told her about our problems ?
yes , because she wanted to listen to them ,
and she had good advice , too. look at me . i love you , okay ?
you just have to take my word for it .
do not trust her .
but you just met her. i ...
you know , you &apos;ve been hanging out with chuck
and you &apos;ve been partying and avoiding me and lying ,
and y @-@ you &apos;re trying to tell me who i can and cannot trust ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand that at all .
we--we all live in brooklyn , so ...
i don &apos;t know .
if--if you need to catch a cab , i think you should do that here .
dan , don &apos;t . i want to talk .
then talk .
i &apos;m gonna get going .
hey , just hold on. one--one second .
i forgot something inside . i &apos;ll catch up with you guys ?
okay .
well , i had fun .
how about you ? what do you want from me ?
i want things to go back to how they were before that night ,
before things got so screwed up .
we were such good friends , and now we can be again .
why would i want to be friends with somebody who blackmails me ,
who outs my little brother at the dinner table ?
eric was an honest mistake . i would never hurt him .
no , i don &apos;t believe you .
i don &apos;t believe you about eric , about anything .
maybe you &apos;re right .
maybe i did it on purpose .
because i can ,
because i know things
about you , about your family ,
about your boyfriend ,
and i know them before you do .
oh , look. cab .
you get home safe .
hold up , guys ! i &apos;m coming .
another way the truth comes out
when you don &apos;t even mean it to ...
&quot; angry , &quot;
&quot; change , &quot;
&quot; trust , &quot;
&quot; girl . &quot;
somethin &apos; you wanna talk about ?
who would have thought scrabble could be so therapeutic ?
that last one was a triple word score .
or when ,
without saying a word ,
it &apos;s still loud and clear .
dad ?
do you think it &apos;d be okay if i joined you ?
you know there &apos;s always room for you here .
yeah , and dad &apos;s totally losing , so he could use your help .
dad , i &apos;m sorry .
oh . i &apos;m sorry about everything .
but the worst thing the truth can do
is when you finally tell it ,
it doesn &apos;t set you free , but locks you away forever .
blair ?
serena , what are you doing here ? it &apos;s late .
oh , my god .
what happened ? what &apos;s wrong ?
talk to me . i can &apos;t .
of course you can .
no. no , b . , this is the one thing i can &apos;t tell you .
i can &apos;t tell anyone .
i @-@ i &apos;m not anyone . i &apos;m me. you can tell me anything .
no , i can &apos;t ...
because then that &apos;d make you a part of it ,
and you can &apos;t be a part of this .
what are you talking about ? you &apos;re starting to scare me .
hey , hey , hey. we &apos;re sisters .
you &apos;re my family. what is you , is me .
there &apos;s nothing that you could ever say to make me let go .
i love you .
what is it ?
i killed someone .
