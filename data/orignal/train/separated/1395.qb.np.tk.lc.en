hey , best man .
yeah , i think i might go with &quot; best person . &quot;
is this about mom again ? i told you , i &apos;m fine .
i was just a little sad for you .
mom &apos;s a no @-@ show ,
and you and dad are hardly even speaking .
i &apos;m leaving you !
not if i leave you first !
what did you do ? !
attention ! attention , please !
the fire has jumped the freeway .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
if you &apos;re evacuating the whole area ,
can &apos;t you just do us last ?
i don &apos;t think you realize
how close you are to actual flames .
hello . pepper saltzman .
big supporter of yours .
have all your calendars .
we &apos;ve waited 10 years .
can we please have an hour ?
i can give you 30 minutes .
we can make that work !
the wedding will go on just in a slightly pared @-@ down version .
claire , you &apos;re up front .
flower girl , strewing .
grooms , come with me .
&quot; ooh ! ahh ! they look so handsome ! &quot;
quartet , quartet , quartet !
and cue sal . start after your limerick .
oh , god , no !
ugh ! we &apos;re all making sacrifices , dear .
i have a prius full of monarch butterflies
who are apparently coming home with me .
aah ! no !
her water broke !
no ! no , it did not ! i am barely pregnant !
thank you all for being here on this joyous occasion .
there once was a homo named tucker --
sal , stop . no , you &apos;re going into labor !
also , just stop !
but we &apos;ve only been together four months .
i just love you so much ,
i can &apos;t wait to have your baby .
god ! kids ruin everything !
yeah , they sure do .
let &apos;s get you to the hospital and have our miracle baby .
okay .
just so you know ,
sometimes when babies come this early ...
... they &apos;re black .
okay , this is a disaster !
we have no one to marry us !
dearly beloved , that is a problem .
yep .
thanks to $ 35 and the internet ,
you are looking at
the good reverend phillip humphrey dunphy .
over the last year , i &apos;ve dropped a few subtle hints
to mitch and cam that i was available .
hey , have you guys decided who &apos;s gonna officiate your wedding ?
&apos;cause i got ordained online .
oh , my god . a wallaby !
oh , my gosh !
to be continued !
phil , you &apos;re a lifesaver . thank you .
no thanks necessary .
cameron , marrying you would
make me the happiest man on earth .
everyone , attention , please !
i &apos;ve been informed by the fire chief
we need to leave immediately !
the winds have shifted !
what ?
but w @-@ we have 30 minutes !
a fellow wedding facilitator has informed me
a beautiful space just became available .
to the shuttles !
but we don &apos;t know a thing about this place .
oh , my mistake .
let &apos;s go over it .
it &apos;s a quaint , rustic spot ,
though its chief selling point
is it &apos;s not about to become a kiln !
to the shuttles !
cam , where are the shuttles
that brought everyone up from the parking lot ?
apparently they were double booked .
this is the best pepper could do .
this is how we &apos;re getting everyone to the wedding ?
half our guests are gay .
we &apos;re finally giving them
a good memory on a school bus .
that doesn &apos;t look completely sewn on .
you might want to get something to cover that .
oh , good idea .
thank you .
what did you say to merle that make him want to leave barb ?
i have no idea !
we were just shooting the breeze --
wedding day , dede ,
how happy i am now that i &apos;m with you .
why would you say something like that ?
now you &apos;re breaking somebody &apos;s heart .
i didn &apos;t mean for her to get hurt .
not her , him when he realizes
that not every second wife looks like this .
thank you for lending me your jacket , jay .
it &apos;s good to know there are still gentlemen in the world .
oh , it &apos;s you , barb .
i didn &apos;t see you there on account of
my bright future .
thank you , gloria .
standing up to that old goat
was best thing i ever did .
what &apos;s all that about ?
no , no . the thing is that she told me a story about a goat
and it &apos;s very old and then the goat --
oh , don &apos;t give me that .
i told her to express herself .
i believe that in a good marriage ,
a woman can ex--
fine . whatever . i &apos;ll undo it .
we can &apos;t let cam know what the situation with his parents is .
he &apos;s very delicate .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m involved
in breaking up yet another marriage .
what ?
hey , hey . how you holding up ?
uh , i &apos;ve had better days .
but you and me -- we &apos;re cool , right ?
we probably have some things that we should talk about ,
but maybe we save it for a less @-@ stressful day .
this is not your fault , by the way .
the fire was an act of god .
not that god sent a fireball down
to keep a couple guys from getting married , but , uh ...
i didn &apos;t say that right .
there &apos;s no way that this -- any of this --
is part of god &apos;s plan .
save something for the toast , dad .
damn it .
where do you want this ?
bus five . what &apos;s wrong with your voice ?
the three of us just took a road trip .
we sang broadway tunes
all the way to the texas border .
and then from the other side of texas to florida .
hey , so you &apos;re , like , the minister ?
kinda . when they lost sal ,
the situation was a no @-@ brainer ,
which made them think of me .
isn &apos;t there a lot you have to remember to marry people ?
not really . they all follow the same basic pattern .
&quot; we &apos;re gathered here today to join these two
&quot; in holy matrimony .
do you take him to be your lawfully wedded spouse ? &quot;
and the first person says --
i do ?
right .
then i ask the second person ,
&quot; do you take him to be your lawfully wedded spouse ? &quot;
you know the drill , right ?
i do .
then i say , &quot; by the powers vested in me
by the state of california ,
i now pronounce you legally wed . &quot;
bingo , bango , bongo , you &apos;re married .
awesome .
really awesome .
look , barb , i know what you &apos;re going through .
you and merle are at a crossroads in your marriage .
it feels like the end of the world ,
but in time , you &apos;ll see it more as a --
right .
a little hiccup that we all go through .
my advice -- don &apos;t do anything .
just take some time and breathe .
maybe through your nose .
did you happen to find anything in one of my pockets ?
funny you should &quot; flask . &quot;
maybe i &apos;ll just take that .
excuse me .
well , it &apos;s much lighter now , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
okay , this is weird .
i think this is the same seat i used to nervously scratch at
on my way to school .
oh , poor thing .
yeah .
even then i felt such pressure to be perfect .
andy &apos;s flight is delayed again .
okay . that was close .
we almost connected on a human level .
he &apos;s doing the dumbest thing .
his girlfriend broke up with him ,
and he &apos;s flying out to win her back .
that sounds so romantic .
it &apos;s so weak .
this girl throws a fit , he goes running .
if they get back together , she has all the power .
oh , my god . you like him .
no , i don &apos;t . what ?
this is so hilarious .
he &apos;s totally not your type .
shut up .
please . you can &apos;t stop thinking about him , you &apos;re checking on him .
he &apos;s not even like a real person .
he &apos;s like a muppet .
i don &apos;t even get some of sal &apos;s remarks here .
&quot; marriage is like a freeway --
messy , but if you communicate , it &apos;s so worth it . &quot;
honey , that does not say &quot; freeway . &quot;
i can &apos;t use any of this ,
but i don &apos;t want the whole ceremony to be generic .
there needs to be some magic in it .
well , you can read a poem or maybe --
hold on . back up .
i like your last idea -- a magic trick .
i did not suggest a magic trick .
after all , what &apos;s better than magic
to symbolize the wonder of marriage ? !
excuse me . i &apos;m talking to you .
yeah , yeah .
they looked good on you in the store ,
but now you &apos;re not sure .
that was the topic 10 minutes ago .
well , maybe if i stapled the sports page to my head ,
you &apos;d pay attention .
as long as it covered your mouth .
what ?
nothing .
ugh , when are we going to be there ?
soon , honey . very soon .
come on . give us a smile .
remember , this is the happiest day
of your dads &apos; lives .
the butterflies are eating me !
well , who told you to jostle the crate ? !
oh , blah . one got in my mouth .
what a bunch of babies .
pepper said it was nice . i hope we like it .
cam , cam , listen , whatever &apos;s on the other side of this curtain ,
we cannot be disappointed .
you &apos;re right .
today is not about flowers or superficial things .
right . okay .
oh , thank god .
it &apos;s pretty . i was so scared !
oh , i love it , i love it . i could cry !
oh , don &apos;t cry . you &apos;ll streak your bronzer .
everyone , please take your seats !
we &apos;ll be starting in cinco minutes ,
10 at the most .
do you ever notice with ronaldo
how his language barrier sort of fluctuates ?
how is this place even available ?
oh , dreadful story .
runaway bride , suicidal groom , feuding families .
it really puts our mundane problems in perspective .
oh , we can &apos;t dim the lights .
then break some .
these are not young men !
why don &apos;t you two go freshen up ?
wait .
why am i seeing only half a quartet ?
ed and jim are volunteer firemen .
of course they are .
try to play in front of a mirror .
a kiss for luck .
oh , okay . yes .
a kiss for luck , my little gingersnap !
oh , okay . oh , wow , barb .
oh , oh , good thing we &apos;re out of the fire zone .
well , you know your dad gave me a little wedding helper .
i didn &apos;t know the jacket still had a --
flask . yeah . oh , that &apos;s nice .
you know , at the end of the ceremony ,
i kiss a man ,
so you might want to fill &apos; er up .
this is how you try to fix things ?
you get her drunk ?
don &apos;t blame him .
she &apos;s been a loose cannon
ever since she started going
to that church service that starts at 10 : 30 .
they play guitar music .
it &apos;s a celebration .
it &apos;s gomorrah .
the pastor wears one of them madonna microphones .
oh , madonna microphones .
where &apos;s my little corn silk ?
hey , you want to go out and do something fun after this thing ?
no , i was thinking about staying in tonight
and spending some time with joe .
ugh , you never want to do anything
since that baby came along .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
you -- you have the , um --
marriage license , rings , signing pen , toast ?
yes , of course .
there &apos;s a reason i &apos;m the best person .
you know that &apos;s just a title for today , right ?
yeah , i &apos;m the best person at this wedding .
i &apos;m still kind of hearing -- what is that ?
oh , my god . oh , my god .
wait . oh .
that &apos;s pollen . oh , no .
honey .
don &apos;t look at me .
i only had one corsage .
where &apos;s your sister ?
haley ?
andy ! you &apos;re still here ?
yeah .
my flight keeps getting delayed because of weather .
oh , so does the wedding .
wait . is fire weather ?
there was a fire ?
yeah .
guess that explains that smoking dress .
line , andy .
well , if you &apos;re -- if you &apos;re just killing time ,
the new wedding venue is nearby .
you could totally come and hang .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m exactly dressed for it .
of course , if i was with you ,
no one would even look at me .
wow , okay .
that is quite enough pie for you , young man .
ugh . i &apos;ve got to get back .
um , look , i didn &apos;t come here for coffee .
andy , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea
for you to get on that plane .
i don &apos;t think beth is worth it .
you don &apos;t even know beth .
i think i do .
i think i &apos;ve been her .
let me guess .
for every 10 letters you write , she writes one .
she &apos;s always the one who ends the phone call .
you happen to mention when your birthday &apos;s coming up
because you know deep down she &apos;s already forgotten it .
meanwhile , she gives you just enough to keep you on the hook .
hello ?
of course i didn &apos;t leave , mom .
you walked past me two seconds ago .
i &apos;m just saying , you deserve better .
oh , my god !
i &apos;m waving at you !
stay where you are !
i &apos;m walking towards you !
lily , here you go . i &apos;m taking your corsage .
but it &apos;s mine .
you &apos;re the flower girl .
it &apos;s part of your job .
read the fine print . thank you .
claire !
what ?
i @-@ i need the rings .
for what ?
to practice our trick .
come on , come on , come on .
oh , honey , i don &apos;t know about the magic trick .
don &apos;t you think people should be
focused on cam and mitch ?
i &apos;m hoping so . it &apos;s the perfect misdirect .
okay , here &apos;s how we &apos;re gonna do this .
you hold the rings .
okay .
i say , &quot; they say the best marriages
contain just a little bit of magic . &quot;
we hold up our arms .
you let go of the rings .
they slide down the thread
as if mysteriously floating
all the way -- half the way to me .
merle , i know that after talking to jay ,
you think that there are better things out there for you .
who says there isn &apos;t ?
okay .
take a trip with me to the future .
it &apos;s a regular night at the local honky tonk .
look , who &apos;s that man sitting alone in the bar ?
it &apos;s merle .
a beautiful woman approaches .
she asks , &quot; is this seat taken ? &quot;
he says , &quot; no , &quot; and then she grabs the chair
and goes sits next to a much younger ,
much handsomer @-@ looking man .
then merle turns around to the bartender
and say , &quot; happy tuesday , huh ? &quot;
the bartender replies ,
&quot; don &apos;t you mean &apos; merry christmas &apos; ? &quot;
you see , merle ?
it was christmas the whole time !
okay , it &apos;s show time . cue the processional .
phil , as they say in my native south carolina ,
it &apos;s time to marry your brother @-@ in @-@ law .
flower girl , work those petals .
wedding party walking .
what &apos;s that ?
i &apos;ll be right there .
okay . last looks .
very handsome .
this is my second favorite suit of yours .
second ?
right after your birthday suit .
hey . cut it out . i &apos;m practically a married man .
i know .
you know , you scared me earlier with what your dad said .
w @-@ what ?
well , just about the fire , you know ...
being a sign we shouldn &apos;t get married .
it was kind of apocalypticy .
no .
then the sky turned dark .
yeah , because of the fire .
well , and then we had a flood .
you know , sal -- sploosh .
i think you &apos;re stretching just a little bit .
because we paid for this room !
mr. and mrs. lucas , we just need 20 minutes !
cut the boy soprano .
no , we need these people out of here !
i can see you want to run again , don &apos;t you ?
follow your heart .
on your mark , get set , live , baby !
you don &apos;t need that !
you don &apos;t see this as another biblical sign ?
不允许同性角色之间产生恋情
a swarm of &quot; lucases . &quot;
slight change , everyone !
don &apos;t worry !
there &apos;s always a plan &quot; c &quot; !
oh ! they &apos;re everywhere !
what is wrong with you people ?
leave the box alone !
oh , if that thing is coming in ,
we need to put a few more people on the lawn .
okay , this place is cozy , right ?
yeah . yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s -- oh , it &apos;s going to be fine .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
although we may need to
sit some of the overflow guests upstairs .
oh , we don &apos;t -- we don &apos;t own the upstairs .
really ?
i always assumed there was a nicer part
you weren &apos;t showing me .
make sure their checks have cleared .
just get another caterer here
or these people will be eating butterfly bisque !
okay , i &apos;m trying to remain calm ,
but you realize that &apos;s another sign of the apocalypse , right ?
famine ?
he sounds as bad as steven , stefan ,
and longines .
oh , so what you &apos;re saying
is we have four hoarse men ?
stop with the frowning .
today , you smile for your son .
tomorrow , you can do whatever you want .
tomorrow , i might just move out .
oh , now i feel a smile coming on .
oh , my god . you &apos;re texting andy now ?
i &apos;m just letting him know he can hang out here if he wants .
haley , i hope you know what you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m not doing anything .
i mean , it &apos;s one thing if you &apos;re actually into him ,
but if you &apos;re just playing around with him
for the fun of it ...
here &apos;s the thing about nice , quiet dorks like andy .
you get over us much faster than
we get over you .
hi . sorry . so sorry .
excuse me . it &apos;s my husband .
&quot; they say the best marriages &quot; --
i don &apos;t mean to rush you ,
but there &apos;s like 80 people waiting to get in here .
no , no , no . i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
i just worked up a new magic trick .
i start by saying , &quot; they say the best marriages
contain just a little bit of magic . &quot;
then in my sleeves , i &apos;ve rigged two confetti poppers
that i found in lily &apos;s closet .
so when i raise my arms ...
really ? you &apos;re not gonna say , &quot; don &apos;t do that &quot; ?
no , i mean , i don &apos;t think you need the magic trick ,
but if you do it , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be great .
oh , honey .
oh , god , let me get that . honey ! no !
honey , no ! hey !
phil ! oh , no !
no , no , water &apos;s on ! water &apos;s on !
no ! you --
just a minute .
just a minute .
hey andy .
hey .
has the wedding started yet ?
oh , yeah , lots of times .
what &apos;s up ?
oh , nothing .
hey , that thing you said before about me deserving better ,
you just meant , like , in general , right ?
you weren &apos;t thinking of anyone in particular ?
yeah , no , i @-@ i just meant you deserve to be happy .
and if it &apos;s this girl , great .
if not , great .
um , sometimes the hardest part
is just figuring out what you want .
yeah , that &apos;s what i thought .
well , enjoy the wedding .
thanks . have a nice trip .
yeah . i &apos;ll see you .
i &apos;m so glad we did this .
i know . who were we kidding ?
it was so gonna happen .
i can &apos;t get enough of this .
no , mitch is fine . still mad at me , though .
you know how touchy he can be , dede .
remember when we tried to cheer him up
after his first ice @-@ skating competition ?
how were we supposed to know third place is a good thing ?
remember he tromped off
across that muddy field in his skates ?
he sunk like a woolly mammoth .
hey , dede , if you &apos;re around the fourth of july ,
you should come by and watch the wedding video .
no , we &apos;re out of town in august .
all right . well , soon . okay .
oh , dede , i don &apos;t think i have your new --
okay , it &apos;s magic time , everyone !
phil , please take your place beneath our majestic arch .
cue the quartet .
where &apos;s the other one ?
he rode with the caterer who flipped his truck .
why do good things happen to everyone but me ?
let &apos;s send the flower girl
before she &apos;s a flower teenager .
oh , so sad .
sorry .
what is ...
yeah . like i &apos;m the problem .
is your dad here ?
yeah , he should be right --
oh -- oh , my god .
he &apos;s out on the sidewalk on the phone .
do you want me to go get him ?
no , no , i don &apos;t . let &apos;s just -- come on .
let &apos;s just do this .
mitchell .
is this really how you want to get married ?
well , it &apos;s not ideal .
no , people don &apos;t have any rice to throw
because they &apos;re chewing it raw out of starvation .
half of our guests are on the lawn and ...
there go the sprinklers .
okay , let &apos;s just call time of death on this .
all right , yeah .
hey , everybody , um , thank you so much
for , uh , for dealing with all this today .
it means a lot to us .
but unfortunately , this is not gon--
stop . you can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m way ahead of you , dad ,
and thank you for stopping by .
what i mean is , you can &apos;t get married like this .
you two deserve the kind of wedding
you &apos;ve been talking about nonstop
for the last nine months .
what do you mean ?
you bring it up every chance that you get .
i know what nonstop means !
trust me , okay ?
now , what are we all standing around for ?
my son &apos;s getting married today .
all right , jay .
it &apos;s what this golf club needs .
shake it up a little .
go on , dear .
how often do your fathers get married ?
so far , one , two ...
why am i still seeing you ?
you can take your seat , dad .
we &apos;re about to start .
actually , i thought you and i would take a little walk .
i remember it like it was yesterday --
the day that mitchell came home from the hospital
in a very unfashionable white diaper
with three strands of scraggly raggedy andy hair .
if he &apos;s doing it , i &apos;m doing it .
you coming , barb ?
you old sweet talker .
wait for me !
we were inseparable .
i was his big sister ,
his big brother , his nemesis ,
his protector , his best friend .
i was his first partner .
and i loved every minute of it .
thank you all for being here on this happy occasion .
they say the best marriages contain just a little bit of magic .
believe me .
i know .
we &apos;re gathered here today to join two amazing people .
so naturally , i was a little picky
when it came to who was going to be replacing me ,
and then i met this cam .
and sure , he was warm and funny and loving .
cameron , do you take mitchell to be your husband ?
i do .
cameron , would you please place this ring on mitchell &apos;s finger ?
mitchell , do you take cameron to be your husband ?
i do .
then by the powers vested in me by the state of california ,
i am privileged to pronounce you spouses for life .
you may now kiss your husband .
i wondered ,
&quot; was he really
everything i wanted for my brother ?
was he really the best person ? &quot;
no , i &apos;m the best person .
and now i am very pleased to raise a glass
and introduce for the first time ever --
on our fourth try --
great husbands , mitch and cam .
yes !
i saw that .
what ?
the way you look at my sister .
you do it all the time , you know .
i do not .
just not in front of me , okay ?
so , have you heard from your dads on their honeymoon ?
you must really miss them , don &apos;t you ?
sorry . i was being dramatic .
no , you were right .
you &apos;ll hate yourself .
right again .
