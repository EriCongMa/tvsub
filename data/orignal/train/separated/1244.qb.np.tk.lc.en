we found a hole in sara &apos;s closet
in her room at the radley .
the night charlotte came home , the night she was murdered
someone used a landline from the two crows to call this house .
i &apos;m so glad we finally told you .
now we don &apos;t have to sneak around anymore .
congratulations .
i buried someone who made my life hell for years .
i &apos;m now being questioned in her murder .
i lost my job .
come back to new york with me .
i can &apos;t .
damian , i came to ask you if your article is fully about
millennials and politics or if you have another angle .
the murder weapon was a golf club .
what detective tanner described was a hollow piece
of metal cut with a rectangle at the end .
i &apos;ve been working with the data from yvonne &apos;s cell phone .
these are my mom &apos;s medical records . how do they have these ?
you and i need to talk about ezra fitz .
does he know what you &apos;re doing ?
you wrote this , big parts of it .
melissa &apos;s suitcase is broken
and there &apos;s a part missing that &apos;s metal , hollow
and cut with a rectangle in the end .
did she check out or get hurled out ?
this is what the inside of sara harvey &apos;s head must look like .
i would have made her lick the carpet before she left .
okay , let &apos;s show ali the closet .
urgh ! who leaves coleslaw in the middle of the floor ?
hanna , closet .
when you asked the front desk
did they know why she left so fast ?
what do you think ?
she &apos;s not racing off to a messies anonymous meeting .
she knows we &apos;re on to her .
it &apos;s gone .
there &apos;s no hole .
what ? that &apos;s impossible .
there &apos;s not even a seam where the hole used to be .
guys , maybe this wasn &apos;t her room .
don &apos;t . stop cutting sara any slack .
hey , i don &apos;t care how much she claimed to have loved
charlotte like a sister . this girl has two faces .
we should leave .
no .
look , guys , if my mom finds out that i used that key card--
we don &apos;t have to introduce ourselves .
we just have to walk out the door .
emily , stop .
i &apos;m not leaving until we can go back down there .
okay , she doesn &apos;t even believe it exists !
i didn &apos;t say that , i &apos;m just trying to
understand why she would stalk you .
because she thinks we had something
to do with charlotte &apos;s murder .
she thinks we know who did it !
shh !
alright , let &apos;s move .
are you giving up ?
nope , it &apos;s done .
seriously ?
the file was corrupted .
if they wanna leak your mom &apos;s medical report
they &apos;re gonna have to break into her doctor &apos;s office again .
and you &apos;re sure that nobody in the phillips &apos; camp
could ever trace this back to you ?
no way , i mean , they might find an exit node
but they &apos;ll never figure out where it originated .
the anonymizer software disseminates traffic
through multiple sources and ..
did i just put you to sleep ?
no , no , i &apos;m not .
i , i just ..
i don &apos;t really think that this is just gonna go away .
you know , my mom could still be ambushed
right before the election .
you &apos;re right , but if you tell her that
then she &apos;s gonna wanna know how you learned about her
being sick , and you open that box ...
she &apos;s got enough to worry about .
hey , let &apos;s make you some breakfast .
you need protein .
fingernails can only supply so much .
when did you see me chew my fingernails ?
in your sleep .
you went after mine first .
no .
yes .
hey .
emily , hey , come in .
sorry to interrupt .
no , you &apos;re not .
uh , you hungry ?
i can &apos;t stay .
i &apos;ve got to get to the bursar &apos;s office at hollis .
what &apos;s wrong ?
can you go back down with me ?
we &apos;ll find another way to get down there .
emily , stop .
i know .
but if sara harvey is hiding under the hotel ,
what is she planning next ?
don &apos;t do this to yourself , okay ?
she may have had nothing to do with the fertility clinic .
she &apos;s just playing on your fear .
yeah , well , it &apos;s workin &apos; .
okay , it &apos;s not like someone stole my chapstick .
this person may be storing my future offspring
in a styrofoam cooler .
and if the police don &apos;t come up with a suspect soon
then sara &apos;s gonna think we &apos;re withholding information .
okay , but we &apos;re not withholding anything .
wh @-@ what was that look ?
you guys know something .
oh , what ?
no , we know nothing .
melissa &apos;s suitcase is broken .
what ?
the pull @-@ up handle is missing a rod .
it could &apos;ve been used as a weapon to crack someone &apos;s neck .
okay , can we please not go there ?
melissa wasn &apos;t even in town the night
that charlotte was murdered .
are you sure about that ?
emily , my mother &apos;s election is two weeks away .
i get it , but if melissa had--
what ?
never wanted to watch charlotte walk the streets again ?
i mean , that pretty much covers everyone who loves us .
should we add your mom to that suspect list too ?
i don &apos;t know how to handle this .
you have to tell him .
how ?
liam , he spent the last week pounding out chapters .
but if he ships them to boston before you speak to him--
he won &apos;t . he wants to speak to me first .
he wants feedback .
did you sleep at all last night ?
i &apos;ll sleep when i &apos;m unemployed .
okay .
jillian &apos;s gonna fire me .
or give you a book contract . she loved what you wrote .
because she thought that ezra wrote it .
okay , one step at a time .
first , tell the author .
hopefully , he &apos;ll be ... flattered .
flattered ?
then he &apos;ll call our boss .
tell her he &apos;s had an epiphany
and he wants to take the story in another direction .
i think the word is betrayed .
aria , two weeks ago , this dude
was pouring rum on his corn flakes .
he &apos;s lucky that someone who once sat in the back of his classroom
actually cares enough to save his reputation .
it &apos;s , it &apos;s not that simple .
i &apos;m gonna tell him this afternoon .
this hasn &apos;t even hit the stores yet .
i called in a favor .
it &apos;s lovely . silk ?
yeah , and if you want , you can pair it with that beaded bolero
unless you think that &apos;s too mother @-@ of @-@ the @-@ bride .
this mother is a bride .
did you bring all of these back from new york ?
yeah , i tried to grab everything
without running into my former boss .
you can get that .
oh , no .
it &apos;s jordan . he &apos;ll call back .
no , please , answer it .
i mean , i feel guilty that i &apos;m making you do all this
when you have your own wedding--
no , this is work .
and you &apos;re doing this now .
we haven &apos;t even set a date yet .
so , umm , do you wanna try something on
or did i totally strike out ?
no , no , not at all . you did a fabulous job .
it &apos;s just when byron and i first got married
we were very determined not be traditional .
so we rented a barn
and we basically dressed up like cowhands .
well , that &apos;s cute .
i mean , i love theme weddings .
it wasn &apos;t a theme .
it was just two cynical college kids with no money
and a skewed sense of what was romantic .
we made my mom sit on a keg .
ugh ! what did she wear ?
this time , i wanna feel like more of a bride
and i wanna feel elegant .
i can do elegant .
i know you can .
can you show me what you &apos;ve picked out for yourself
or is that a state secret ?
uh , no , i mean , i , i haven &apos;t even thought
about what i &apos;m gonna wear .
seriously ?
and your mom already sent out
shower invitations and you haven &apos;t--
you know what ? give me till the end of the day .
i know the dress .
so sorry to bother . can i borrow a pen ?
what ? oh , sure .
thanks .
can i also borrow $ 1000 ?
i &apos;m lucky if i have enough left to buy a single textbook .
hold it . you taking intro to psych ?
yeah .
me too .
you know , the professor &apos;s supposed to be a real trip .
he &apos;s actually giving a lecture tonight .
i was thinking about going and asking a few questions
just so i can start off on his good side .
you wanna join ?
i @-@ i &apos;ll run my questions past you
so i don &apos;t sound like the village idiot .
you free ?
umm , yeah .
cool . i &apos;m damian .
emily .
hey , when did you get back ?
just now .
how did it go ?
fine , i guess .
i need a long hot shower .
whose suitcase is that ?
mine .
what happened to your other one ?
it was broken . i tossed it .
good morning .
it was until i opened my eyes .
do you have time for a coffee ?
oh , honey , i &apos;ve already had a pot .
oh , jeez , gil , not the shriners .
we &apos;re supposed to be hitting up new voters
not resuscitating the dead .
what &apos;s going on ? you look like a kid
who just dropped her sucker in the sand .
honey , what is it ?
you should have told us .
told you what ?
that the cancer came back .
you kept it from us once
when you promised us that that would never happen again .
the prognosis was good , so there was no reason--
there &apos;s every reason , mom .
i am not one of your constituents .
i &apos;m gonna be fine , spencer .
how did you find out about this ?
that doesn &apos;t even matter , but if i know
you can bet that your opponent &apos;s camp knows as well .
what do they know ?
the doctors gave me a clean bill of health .
they supported my bid for office .
how about letting me support you ?
look , i was planning on telling you and melissa
after the election .
but gil , he , he begged me not to share this .
it would , it would
scare off the voters , hijack the platform .
it would be all that anyone would ever ask me about .
so what if they did ?
mom , i work on capitol hill .
i know all of the traps .
but you &apos;re running on a platform based on transparency
and integrity .
do not set yourself up to be blindsided
once you get into the office .
you know , you were the one who taught me
that courage is all about having grace under fire .
i mean , it doesn &apos;t really get harder than this .
you &apos;re right .
thank you for reminding me why i did this .
mom , you &apos;re gonna make a great senator .
no .
i meant why i had kids .
you get the chance to make people better than yourself .
i love you .
do you wanna send that back , order something else ?
oh , no , no . it &apos;s tasty .
listen , uh , okay , so your mother and i have this crazy idea .
uh , we were thinking how great it would be
if we were actually married by someone who really knew us .
like you .
what ?
dad , i can &apos;t officiate your wedding . i &apos;m not a minister .
well , no , wait , that &apos;s the easy part .
you can just get a license online .
i mean , we would still have to be recognized
by the state for the ceremony--
dad , seriously , you don &apos;t want me to do that .
why not ? you are the writer in this family .
okay , listen , there &apos;s no pressure , okay ?
it was just this crazy idea that your mom and i have .
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t want to .
i just , i don &apos;t want mike to feel left out or anything .
oh ... don &apos;t worry about mike .
your brother &apos;s not coming .
why ? why , i thought he said he was gonna try to--
i just think he &apos;s not , not so happy about this .
that is insane . why wouldn &apos;t he want
you and mom to be back together ?
possibly because he has never forgiven me for why we broke up .
he doesn &apos;t trust that i won &apos;t hurt her again .
well , it &apos;s his loss
because it &apos;s gonna be a very special day .
i &apos;ll work on the ceremony tonight .
she got her first text .
wait , so now this freak thinks that alison &apos;s hiding
something about the murder too ?
that doesn &apos;t even make sense .
well , if it is sara harvey , she &apos;s probably furious
that alison &apos;s talking to us again .
why is melissa just sitting there in her car ?
wait .
turns out my trip was a huge success .
polls show a 12 % gain .
i &apos;m more persuasive than i thought .
hail to the conqueror .
hey , do you , umm , have that
luggage tag on your old suitcase ?
gil said you really need to submit it if you want--
forget about it . the trip &apos;s already paid for .
put the funds toward mom &apos;s victory party .
hey , umm , 是how did you break your suitcase ?
what ?
i told him about it .
&apos;cause he just really likes to fix things .
what makes you assume i broke it ?
well , when did you notice it was broken ?
when i pulled it out of the cab from the philly airport .
the idiot took every bumpy , potholed street
to avoid baseball traffic .
have a nice walk .
bye .
i know what you &apos;re gonna say .
well , then i won &apos;t say it .
say it .
your sister got back into town two saturdays ago .
right ?
mmm .
the phillies had an away game that day
so that traffic would &apos;ve been in baltimore .
please don &apos;t be silent . just talk this through with me .
aria , it &apos;s done . you &apos;ve already submitted six chapters .
did jillian like it ? was she pleased ?
kinda , yeah .
on a scale of one to ten
ten being very pleased , over the moon--
ezra--
i need a number .
nine , eight and a half , i ..
eight and a quarter .
she had notes .
did she ? and was i receptive ?
ezra , i will go to my boss on monday
and i will tell her the truth .
aria , you can &apos;t do that .
she &apos;ll kick you to the curb .
how could she even trust you again ?
it &apos;s what it is .
no , it isn &apos;t .
i know you were trying to protect me .
you saw that i was falling apart .
and you assumed the worst .
you thought the jury would hand down a lighter sentence
if i wrote a painful and gripping story
which also has all the makings of a great romantic novel
if you wanna write that too .
i can &apos;t really tell if you wanna hug me or punch me .
how can i punch you ? this wasn &apos;t a career move .
this , this was an act of love .
oh , we , we could just turn in all of it .
i mean , dickens was paid by the inch .
can i just read what you wrote ?
it &apos;s probably a lot better than what i have .
okay , tell me you &apos;re not in love .
it &apos;s gorgeous .
and i got a simple veil to go with it .
nothing too insane , but just a little something to add mystery .
the mystery is how am i going to walk in it .
i may need to borrow emily &apos;s legs .
well , i &apos;ll hem it .
you &apos;re gonna rock this dress , i promise .
please try it on . oh , wait .
what about the veil ?
no , that &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t want anything to detract from the dress .
you did good .
your work here is done .
what about the tables ?
you want them to complement the dress , right ?
can i please do the tables ?
knock yourself out .
go back outside . i don &apos;t want you to see the bride .
it &apos;s bad luck .
i &apos;m not the groom , hanna .
i &apos;m the minister or officiator , whatever .
well , i &apos;m styling it , so i guess we &apos;ll both be working the party .
wait , you &apos;re gonna be there ?
that &apos;s weird .
why is it weird ?
because i ..
i didn &apos;t invite any friends . i was trying to be sensitive .
sensitive to what ?
making you sit at a small wedding with caleb and spencer ,
two feet from the ceremony .
would you be comfortable with that ?
i have no issue with spencer and caleb , alright ?
they &apos;re great together and we &apos;re all different people now .
i &apos;m happy for them . this is happy .
ali , what is it ?
the night that charlotte came home ,
we stayed up late talking .
and i told her about us .
she stared at me like a cat .
and then she went upstairs .
i could tell that she felt betrayed .
probably more by me than you .
i was her doctor .
no , i think she was angry at me .
that &apos;s why she ran out in the middle of the night .
it may not have been because of a phone call .
i might have delivered my sister
to whoever did that to her .
alison , th @-@ that &apos;s not true .
the person who failed charlotte in that moment
was me .
not you .
hey , how did it go ?
excellent . i &apos;m now gainfully employed .
well , at least until tomorrow night .
i &apos;m starved . do you wanna order in ?
oh , i &apos;m going to a lecture with a guy from my psych class .
trying to earn brownie points with the new professor .
well , congratulations .
at least one of us will have a degree that matters .
i enrolled , hanna , but it &apos;s not like it was four years ago
when the only thing i had to worry about in freshman year
was catching something from a communal shower curtain .
emily , you &apos;re not gonna have--
yes , i am . hanna .
how am i supposed to take notes when the voice in my head
is telling me that sara harvey is torturing you
for something that melissa might have done ?
wait , melissa hastings ?
melissa might have called charlotte from the diner ,
she could &apos;ve been the one
who lured her out in the middle of the night--
no , no , no , hold on . wasn &apos;t melissa in london ?
spencer thinks so . caleb doesn &apos;t .
oh , who &apos;s damian ?
uh , he goes to hollis . that &apos;s who i &apos;m meeting up with .
it &apos;s a good thing i got here early . it &apos;s insane .
that line behind me is waiting to get in .
can you save me a seat ?
sure .
yeah , i just wanted to make sure you &apos;re still coming .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
bye .
he looks familiar .
did you ever buy any used books from hollis ?
no , but they did actually deliver a box
for you this afternoon .
really ? i haven &apos;t ordered any .
em , what &apos;s wrong ?
&quot; what to name the baby ? &quot; what class is that ?
oh , my god .
what does it say ?
i &apos;ve chosen to share this with you
because ultimately , my diagnosis was a wake @-@ up call .
and i trust now that you have this insight
you &apos;ll know that i don &apos;t give up without a fight .
hanna , hey .
hey , uh , did you get my messages ?
no , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m so sorry .
i just turned my phone off , so that i could watch .
are you okay ?
i think melissa could have done it .
i saw your sister years ago in london .
okay , where are you ?
you will never guess who just talked to me .
okay , so i was in line at the bar
and some stranger just compliments my shoes
and i turn around , it &apos;s claudia freakin &apos; greco , caleb .
and don &apos;t pretend like you don &apos;t know who she is .
i have to go .
melissa ?
hello , hanna .
what are you doing here ?
i live here .
well , not in this bathroom , but nearby .
no , this event .
fashion week . did you change careers ?
i came with a friend who ditched me
because i &apos;ve spent the entire night sobbing into my phone .
is that my drink or yours ?
uh , yours .
how &apos;s wren ?
he &apos;s gone . he left me .
that scheming nut job who made your life a living hell
has now moved on to mess with mine .
you mean charlotte ?
who the hell gave that twisted sister phone privileges ?
i mean , how does someone with her resume
get put under penthouse arrest ?
i try not to think about her .
you know , forgive and forget .
yeah , a leopard doesn &apos;t change its spots .
wait , did she call you ?
no , she called wren .
and clearly , she shared information with him
because he &apos;s been looking at me for the last week
like i should be the one locked up .
and is that because of bethany young ?
if she &apos;s willing to tell him , who else is she gonna tell ?
you know , we all have a past , hanna .
aren &apos;t you curious what she plans to use against you ?
here . why don &apos;t we call her and find out ?
melissa , stop .
someone needs to shut her up for good .
melissa , give me my phone !
i &apos;m doing you a favor . you &apos;ll thank me one day .
hi , this is alison dilaurentis .
can i please speak to my sister , charlotte ?
give me the phone .
well , wake her up .
she has her whole life to nap .
tell her hanna wants to say hi .
melissa , stop .
no , i don &apos;t wanna speak to her doctor .
i wanna speak to my bloody sister !
put charlotte on !
i don &apos;t wanna hear her voice !
well , you have a funny way of forgiving , hanna .
why didn &apos;t you tell me about this
when you came home from that trip ?
she didn &apos;t want another person
telling her that she wasn &apos;t over it .
well , neither was your sister .
so can you at least find out
if melissa called that night from the diner ?
thanks .
oh , umm , what was the name
of that sneaky blogger dude from hollis ?
the one who freaked out you and melissa ?
so what made you decide to come back ?
here ... where you grew up .
what was the , what was the draw ?
oh , uh , my mom was alone
so i thought it &apos;d be good to be nearby .
right .
hey , do you wanna grab a cup of coffee in here
and take it across the street ?
sure . that sounds great .
yeah . great .
how do you take it ?
your coffee ?
you know what ? let &apos;s skip the coffee .
let &apos;s grab dinner instead .
even better .
ezra fitz ?
hi , i &apos;m liam greene . uh , we met once before .
i work with aria at the publishing house .
that &apos;s right . yeah .
umm , what brings you to rosewood ?
aria invited me to her parents &apos; wedding .
oh , that &apos;s great . that should be a lot of fun .
in a parents &apos; wedding sort of way . yeah .
i &apos;m actually meeting aria here .
umm , she suggested that , uh , we go over the chapters i gave her .
oh , well , i &apos;m anxious to read them myself .
from what i hear , it &apos;s a great plot .
nice twists . strong characters .
yeah .
umm , i just wanna put it out there .
uh , the protagonist was inspired by this woman
that i traveled the world with .
uh , it &apos;s not aria .
umm , i mean , we never ventured out past philly .
and though some can find romance in the liberty bell
umm , i just wanted to say this so there &apos;s no confusion .
if you thought i was writing about aria and me , i &apos;m not .
oh , look who it is .
uh , sorry , i &apos;m late , i was working on the ceremony
and i must have lost track of time .
umm , so how long have you two been sitting here ?
umm , not long , but i &apos;ll leave you two alone .
i &apos;m sure mr. fitz is eager to get his feedback .
liam .
liam , wait .
does ezra know that you know ?
know what ?
about me ghostwriting .
no , but at least now i know that mr. fitz
was more than just your favorite teacher .
is this why you wanted to stay in rosewood ?
liam .
please pick up , pick up .
please leave a message .
hey , liam , it &apos;s me again .
look , i &apos;m so sorry , okay ?
just .. i @-@ i need a chance to explain .
call me .
oh , but not after 5 : 00 .
i &apos;ll ... be marrying my parents .
bye .
have you eaten today ?
i can &apos;t remember .
what day is it ?
it &apos;s your wedding day .
you can &apos;t be nervous . you &apos;ve married byron before .
true , it makes no logical sense
but when he walks in the room , it &apos;s like i &apos;m 19 again .
god , help me .
well , i think it &apos;s fate .
people who are meant to be together take a break
and then find their way back to their first love .
what &apos;s more romantic than that ?
oh , byron wasn &apos;t my first love .
his name was ricky eichler .
he played the drums
and had green eyes that you could drown in
and he was sexy and badass
and i thought we would be together forever .
what happened to him ?
who knows ?
we graduated and we grew up .
i &apos;ll call him back .
我知道
is that message for me ?
how long are you gonna avoid me ?
i &apos;m not avoiding you . i &apos;m trying--
alison , i will give you as much space as you need .
i just don &apos;t wanna be pushed away because you feel unnecessary guilt .
i &apos;m , i &apos;m feeling a lot of things .
is there any way you can look at me and not see your sister ?
i &apos;m here , alison . i &apos;m alive .
and i love you .
and i wanna spend the rest of my life with you .
what are you saying ?
exactly what you think i said .
i mean , gil said that ..
hey , i wanted to say congratulations
but by the time we got home , you were already asleep .
oh , it was an exhausting day .
what &apos;s wrong ?
apparently , while i was recording the speech
a story came out intended to crush my opponent .
well , that &apos;s politics .
some days you &apos;re the pigeon , some days you &apos;re the statue .
don &apos;t be glib .
this could destroy all the goodwill mom just earned .
how ?
why would anything about christine phillips affect mom &apos;s speech ?
it &apos;s not about christine .
it &apos;s about her daughter .
yvonne ?
why ? what did she do ?
she got rid of an unwanted pregnancy in high school .
and someone was able to dredge up a medical report
which is more than just a little embarrassing
when you &apos;re running on a pro @-@ life platform .
oh , my god .
yeah , it gets worse .
the phillips camp believes the leak came out of our office .
there &apos;s a full @-@ on investigation underway .
any idea who would have put that out there ?
i had a drink with damian and all i could get out of him
was that melissa was definitely back before charlotte was released .
she could have made that call from the diner .
okay , this place is either really unpopular
or really closed . hanna , call me back .
the reception out here sucks , but keep trying .
oh , and send me some wedding pictures .
hello , is anybody there ?
hello ?
who are we when we &apos;re alone ?
who are we when we &apos;re with this other person ?
are we really ready to be with another person
before we truly know ourselves ?
my parents have answered these questions .
they know exactly who they are and what they want .
as individuals , each of them is loving , wise and sensitive .
together , they &apos;re more .
they &apos;re inspiring .
so here they are together again
making a new commitment to be there
for the best week ever and the worst week ever
which sometimes happens in the same week .
byron , ella
do you promise to love , comfort and honor each other
for the rest of your lives ?
we do .
then i now pronounce you husband and wife .
dad , you may kiss mom .
but remember , you &apos;re doing it in front of your daughter .
it can &apos;t be mona .
you don &apos;t know that .
i do .
i made it clear , if she messes with this family
she &apos;s gonna be back underground breathing through a straw .
okay , so what ? you think sara harvey did this ?
forgive the intrusion , but i just got off the phone with gil .
what did he say ?
maybe you should come inside .
i am inside . what did he say ?
christine phillips hired an expert who tracked the source of the leak .
what is going on ?
it was traced back to your ip address , spencer .
what ?
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i haven &apos;t touched this laptop all day .
i was with caleb watching your speech
on his computer at the brew--
spencer , please , don &apos;t lie to me .
you must have hacked into their system .
that &apos;s how you knew about my diagnosis .
no , mom , that &apos;s not how i knew--
no , she didn &apos;t do it .
i did it .
i leaked it .
is that true ?
caleb , why are you saying this ?
do you understand what this means ?
they were prepared to do the same to you .
i .. sometimes you need to make a preemptive strike .
that wasn &apos;t your call to make .
mom , he didn &apos;t do this .
well , you &apos;ll need to resign from this campaign immediately .
mom ?
and it would also be wise to gather
your things and leave here ... tonight .
so where are they going , for the honeymoon ?

i &apos;m joking .
it &apos;s some dumpy , little motel on the jersey shore
where they spent a wild college weekend .

i &apos;m glad i did .
it was helpful to hear what your thoughts are
on true love and ... commitment .
i am ... so sorry .
i wasn &apos;t completely honest about my ..
... history with ezra .
okay .
why did you hold back ?
i guess i still wasn &apos;t being completely honest with myself .
it &apos;s been ..
it &apos;s been confusing .
it was pretty clear on the page .
if he &apos;s the one you were writing about--
i wasn &apos;t or ..
... maybe i was . i don &apos;t know .
writing those words ..
maybe it ... gave me the chance to work it out .
and have you ?
i think so .

i didn &apos;t know until right now .
hey , jordan , sorry , i haven &apos;t called you back .
i &apos;ve been in full wedding mode .

but for ours , i think i picked a date .
how does may 17 sound to you ?
okay , well , umm , call me back .
oh , and i love you .
no . no , you &apos;re not leaving .
please , just go in there and tell my mother the truth .
spencer , she &apos;s two weeks out .
this is the truth she needs to win .
if there needs to be a scapegoat , let it be me .
not you .
caleb--
