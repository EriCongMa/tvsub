I'm cutting you off. You're over-caffeinated.
Hey, Brenda, can I grab you for a second.
Come see me next week if you need more.
I signed the agreement.
My dad manipulated you into signing it.
My mother didn't kill herself.
It's over.
All I know is that Alison is running out of money
and Shaun is the only one who knows how to reach her.
I'm tired of lying.
You have to start thinking of me
as the person you're closest to.
Oh, a night in Tunisia.
Forgot the chickpeas.
Oh, I can run down to Seymour's.
Are you okay, I mean, it's like an hour there and back.
Mr. Fitz.
Walk away, Spencer.
I think we're being watched.
Ezra.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
You think she started up with Ezra and didn't tell us.
Has she told you?
Told me what?
Aria.
Ali's journal.
You're saying that Ezra left that book for us to find.
Which means he knows we know.
We have to tell Aria.
Spencer?
Spencer? Are you alright?
How long have you been here?
I don't know.
Did you sleep here?
I don't know...
I-- I came in here.
Hey, take it easy.
Let's talk for a second.
I'm fine.
I'm just really tired, that's all.
Spencer?
We both know what's going on here.
I think it's time we address the issue...
don't you?
The path you've been going down is very dangerous.
I got to go.
What are you wearing?
It's nothing, I... I had to change.
And this is all I had in my gym locker.
Did you?
Did you have an accident?
What? No.
Or are you going to?
What's up with those shower shoes?
Can you just forget about the outfit, okay.
We have an emergency situation here.
Is that why you called me at 4 a.m.?
Wait, what?
Okay, I thought that after we saw Aria
liplocking with the devil
went home to calm down and crash.
I...
I must've just hit dial while I was asleep.
Look, okay, I know we said
we were going to talk to Aria after school,
but I really think we need to tell her about Ezra sooner.
Like, now.
What?
Spencer, we can't tell her now.
The longer we wait, the more dangerous it becomes.
And you think it's any less dangerous
to drop a bomb like that while she's going into class?
We can't do that to her.
Do what? Protect her?
Ezra spoke to me this morning
and I could barely maintain eye contact.
Meanwhile, for all we know right now,
Aria is hooking up with him in some janitor's closet.
How does that not make your skin crawl?
It does.
Look, I know you don't want to keep her in the dark.
Okay, but this isn't going to be easy.
She's in love with him
and she has given up a lot to be with him.
I mean, it's going to be difficult
enough for her to believe he's even capable of this.
Aria?
You had a question about the--
the reading assignment for the week?
Oh, yeah.
I was just wondering how much information
we have to turn in for the exam.
I know you have history right now,
but I can write you a late pass--
That's okay. What's up?
Have you talked to Spencer today?
No. No. Why?
I feel a little strange coming to you with this.
Did something happen?
All things have started to...
pile up.
The homework Spencer's turning in is sloppy and rambling,
she walks in every morning with circles under her eyes,
I mean, when she's in class, she's either hyper alert
or she's a total zombie.
Yeah, I mean, I've noticed
that she's been little out of it lately.
But she's had a lot to juggle.
And you know Spencer, she's a total stress-case.
A garbanzo bean in the wrong salad bin
is enough to make her her wig out.
Right.
I think it's more than that.
Like what?
She has a problem with amphetamines.
And I'm worried it's become a crutch.
What?
Ezra, that's crazy.
Well, people think it'll improve their academic performance,
but when it's overused--
Ezra, come on, Spencer?
She's got everybody fooled, Aria.
Your friend is a ticking time bomb.
And when she explodes I don't want you to get hit by the shrapnel.
I'm sorry, I can't believe it.
You really think that she's on drugs?
I don't think it. I know it.
I wasn't going to show you this.
I guess I'm willing to break the rules
if it means helping Spencer.
Aria, I'm not trying to be the bad guy here.
These are Hanna's clothes.
So long story.
You want to tell me about it while we go for a ride?
I would love to, but I've this quiz
right after lunch on the French Succession of Popes.
And right now the only thing I know about them
is that they wore pointy hats.
I brought us some food.
Are you still mad at me for taking the money?
No, I was never mad at you.
Disappointed.
I was, maybe a little.
Well, I don't think my mom would have been disappointed.
I think she would have wanted me to live my life.
Find a way to make it full
and share it with the people I love.
You want to start by sharing a sandwich?
Yeah, sounds good.
Are you gonna eat that?
Yeah, I told you that like five seconds ago.
Just take it.
Thank you.
Sorry. I just get...
I just get extra hungry when I'm nervous.
I thought it was sad.
I get sad when I'm nervous.
Look, I've been avoiding Aria all day.
Like I haven't.
I finished my Spanish homework in a toilet stall.
Are you sure this a good idea?
I mean, what if we tell Aria,
Ezra's "A" and then she hates us?
What choice do we have except to prepare for things to get ugly?
Finally.
Is there some cellular dead-zone that you can know about in the school?
What do you mean?
Well, I've texted you both like five times.
Whatever, where's Spencer?
I haven't seen her.
Okay. Well, we need to find her and talk to her right now.
What about?
Right, I think we all know that Spencer's been a little...
extra-intense lately.
And I'd just chalked it up to stress,
but she's not distressed.
She's strung out.
You guys, Spencer has a serious problem.
All right, and this isn't the first time that has happened.
Two years ago it was enough of an issue
that her parents had to ask the school for help.
Look.
Is that okay?
I'm just really tired.
Why don't you come over tonight?
I'll get us take out from Bucali's.
Rent a movie.
Maybe even throw a massage in there if you're good
and you finish all your lasagna.
That sounds amazing, I just... I can't tonight.
Then tomorrow.
We need some time together.
I know.
That's okay. I got that.
Thank you.
I'd almost forgotten your smell.
See you later.
Okay.
Okay. Two diets and a regular, right?
Oh my God.
You guys did it already, didn't you?
Did what?
Nothing.
We're not here to talk about that.
We're here to talk about...
something else.
Spence, we're concerned.
Yeah, I know. We're concerned.
No, we're worried about you.
Me? Why?
Are you a speed freak?
Hanna.
Spencer.
Have you been taking pills to stay awake?
Where is this coming from?
What the hell is happening right now?
We care about you.
Yeah, would you... and that's why we're here.
Right, this is kind of like an intervention.
Yeah, I know. Yours.
Spencer, stop.
We know this has been problem for you before.
I don't know what you guys are talking about.
Where'd you get this?
Ezra.
He's worried about you.
You're kidding me, right?
And you two didn't tell her?
He's "A," Aria!
Ezra is board shorts.
He tried to kill Ali
and he's been torturing us ever since.
Spencer, can we please stick to the subject of you for right now.
How can you not see what's happening right now.
He's trying to undermine me.
He's being "A"!
Please tell me you see what's happening here.
Ezra said that he found you passed out in school today.
That you were barefoot, you were in your pajamas,
and you didn't even know where you were.
Spencer, is that true or is it not true?
Spencer? Talk.
Yes. Okay.
I slept walked.
To school?
Yes.
And I've taken a couple of pills a few times.
And it's not great, I know,
but it's not that big of a deal.
And Ezra is just trying to make it into a bigger deal
than it is because he's trying to get the focus off himself
because he's freaking "A"!
Oh, my God. This is brilliant.
All right, I know that you're feeling cornered.
Oh, God, Aria.
Will you wake up?
This is exactly the kind of
deer in the headlights behavior that almost got you shot
in the back of a night club.
What night club?
I mean... I am...
Okay, I'm confused,
but the point is that I'm not crazy, okay.
You just don't see.
How can you guys not see what's happening.
I can't deal with this right now.
Wren?
He's your hook-up?
Why did you just swipe the pad?
It's not mine.
I've never even seen that before.
I bet you are a cute baby.
Oh, not really.
I had to start wearing corrective lenses when I was still teething.
Yeah, that sounds adorable.
No, it really wasn't.
No, I cannot believe I admitted that.
I must really like you.
Like?
I was...
Was kind of hoping you'd say that other word.
The one that rhymes with glove?
I didn't mean to go there.
I think the candlelight is getting to me.
So do you want to split the steak and fries
or were you more into the chicken?
Mona?
A steak.
Steak sounds great.
I'll be right back.
I just... I have to talk to Mr. Fitz
about a reading assignment.
Hello, Mona.
What are you doing here?
I'm getting something to eat.
Look.
I can't help you anymore.
Why's that?
It's gotten too complicated.
It's always been complicated, Mona.
That's a little too late to back out especially now,
when I need your help.
Ezra?
That's me.
Thank you.
Enjoy your dinner.
So did Aria text you?
Yeah. She said she's staying in.
Can we believe her?
Why?
You think she's going to go see Ezra?
Spencer may have an addiction, but so does Aria.
Love is a drug too.
And who says Ezra doesn't put Asria in a--
What do you call it?
Altered state.
Yeah, exactly.
I think Aria kept her habit a secret, too.
It's a classic druggie move.
So what are you saying?
You still think that Ezra is "A"?
There's too much evidence against him.
We found the Book of Revelations in his desk.
Yeah, but what if that was a plan from the real "A,"
trying to make Fitz look guilty.
"A's" does that.
Can I come in?
Please.
That's all of them.
I don't need them anymore.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Look, I know that my credibility with you guys
kind of got decimated today,
but Ezra is "A."
I'm sure of it.
Maybe you are. But we're not.
I know that.
And all I'm asking
is for the chance to prove it to you.
I've been studying all the changes.
And I think "A" is trying to cover up the place
where he used to meet Ali.
The Hart and Huntsman?
No. Somewhere else.
A place where they can meet and not be seen.
See this?
"Still thinking of Ambrose Pearson."
Right, but that's not what it used to say.
Originally it said "still thinking of Ambrose Pavilion."
"A" changed it so that would sound more like a person's name
so that instead of looking for a location,
we'd be searching for a guy.
Yeah, some weirdo named Ambrose.
Right.
So Ambrose Pavilion is in Norristown Zoo.
So how does that prove that Ezra is "A"?
It doesn't.
But "A" already knows that Ali's still alive.
And "A" knows that she never got that money
in the coffee bag that she needed from Shana.
So all we have to do is convince him
that Ali's going to meet us at Ambrose Pavilion to get it.
And you think the person showing up will be Ezra.
Yeah, I could do dinner if it's on the early side.
Okay, great.
I'll be leaving in five minutes.
All right, bye.
Have you been in your room all day?
Yeah.
It started out as a nap.
I'm leaving to play a round-robin with Tricia and Joan.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Are you still going to join us at the club for dinner?
Oh, I'm totally spaced.
Toby really wants me for dinner at his place tonight.
Okay, fine.
But at least come up with a better excuse
for me to give next time.
Okay.
Love you.
Love you, too.
Good luck.
Hey, it's toby. Leave message.
Hi. It's me.
Change of plans.
My mom is forcing me to go to dinner
with her country club cronies tonight so.
I might be able to make it by after,
gonna be on the later side.
I mean, she was just so desperate.
At first she totally denied it,
and then she just completely flew off the handle.
When I was getting my teaching certificate,
they had us practice confrontations,
that could be really difficult,
people become really defensive.
Defensive?
No, she slid past defense and went straight to offense.
She attacked me, she attacked Emily and Hanna,
And she even went as far--
She went as far as to say what?
She's just...
She's out of control right now.
You know,
I think it's time to tell Spencer's parents about what's going on.
Oh, god.
No, I don't want to have to do that.
If you don't, I'll have to.
And it becomes a much bigger deal
if a teacher gets involved.
But can't we just let her figure this out on her own?
Aria, Spencer doesn't remember driving to school.
She could have killed someone.
I know.
I know that.
But she's a really strong person.
And I promise you, she'll get herself out of this.
At what cost?
Do you remember Radley?
Yes.
She thought she found Toby, dead in the woods.
That's exactly my point.
Seeing a motorcycle helmet and a tattoo
is enough to unravel her completely.
You're right.
Hey.
How did you find out about that?
The tattoo part?
What do you mean?
I mean, how did you know that Spencer only saw
the helmet and a tattoo?
I just don't think that was included
in any of the reports or anything.
I think you must have told me.
Yeah. I probably did.
Can I top you off?
Oh, no. I'm good, Emily. Thanks.
Hey. Yeah, I can't talk right now.
Can I call you back?
Seriously, now is not a good time.
No, I know, I just...
I don't know if I can do it.
We don't even know if Ali's actually going to show up.
Nice. I think he's listening.
Oh, he's definitely listening.
Okay.
Now say something like,
"I know she needs some money,
but it's too dangerous."
I know she needs some money,
but it's too dangerous.
Tell her to get closer to this mush fries.
Just in case he can hear.
Just mention the location we'll go then.
Yeah, I heard you.
Ambrose Pavilion closing.
I got to go.
Hi, good afternoon,
this is Veronica Hastings
calling on behalf of my daughter Spencer.
We were just hoping to refill her prescription today.
If you would, would you please give me a call back at--
You know, actually I'll just try you back again later.
Thank you.
Andrew. Hi.
Hello?
Mrs. Hastings?
Yes?
I'm returning your call from Dr. Griggs's office.
Dr. Griggs?
I spoke to the doctor
and he'd really be more comfortable
if Spencer came in to see him
before he re-ups her prescription.
There must be some mistake
we haven't seen Dr. Griggs in years.
I have it here that you've called several times.
Is that right?
Mrs. Hastings?
Thanks. I'll call you back.
We have less than an hour before closing.
Okay. Ambrose Pavilion.
According to this, we should be right here.
Oh, over there.
Hanna.
I can't.
I'm sorry, just looking at the sign
gives me heebie-jeebies.
You'll be fine. They're all behind glass.
Hanna, come on.
There's nothing to be scared of.
Reptiles first appeared
340 million years ago in Carboniferous Period.
The snake is so cool.
Do you think it eats mice?
Yeah.
The Black Mamba...
Only Ali would think
it's sexy to make out in front of a bunch of reptiles.
That one is sleeping.
Come on.
Can you just toss that thing so we can get out of here.
No.
We have to wait for Spencer to get into position.
But where is she?
I don't know.
She should have been here by now.
What a gyp.
There's nothing in this one except a log covered in goo.
Oh, my god.
The first thing Alison ever told me
about herself was a lie.
Lying was her oxygen.
She could do it while she was laughing.
She could even do it when she was kissing you.
The zoo will close in 5 minutes.
This is Spencer's plan.
She wouldn't have gotten it wrong.
There's Spencer.
Finally, let's move.
Reptiles first appeared 340 million years ago
in the Carboniferous Period.
Today recognize roughly
8,000 species of known reptiles.
Aria?
Aria, I know you're out there.
Why are you hiding from me?
Aria.
Aria.
Aria!
Why are you doing this?
Just come out and talk to me.
Please, just don't do this.
Please come out and talk to me.
Why isn't Spencer doing anything?
She'll make her move when she thinks "A" is here.
And you think that it's going to be Ezra
who shows up?
Guess we'll find out soon.
Okay, once Spencer gives us the signal,
we'll double back.
God, you guys. I'm so sorry, I'm late.
Just help me get this on
and then I can move into position.
The lift is closing in 5 minutes.
Aria, Aria, Aria, I didn't mean for it to end this way.
Damn it!
Gosh. She was just here.
Who was?
Let's get out of here.
The Black Mamba
is the longest venomous snake in Africa...
The Brown Tree Snake is arboreal and rear-fanged.
Killer monster emerges from hibernation.
Green Anaconda is the largest snake in the world.
Reptile Black Mamba
is the longest venomous snake in Africa.
No, Emliy don't!
The zoo is closed to general public.
You have to leave.
Sorry.
We got locked in. We're going now.
The Anaconda is the largest snake in the world.
Help! Somebody help me!
Stop, stop. Please, please, I know you're upset,
but just hear me out.
Don't touch me.
Why did we stop?
I know what you saw back there, and I can explain it.
You knew Alison. You knew her.
You pretended not to, and you're...
Yes, yes. I know, I lied.
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to tell you so many times, but I was afraid.
I was afraid that you wouldn't forgive me.
I met Alison in college.
She lied about her age and I believed her.
I don't want to hear this. I don't want to hear it.
I just want to get off.
Aria, please, just listen to me.
Nothing you say will change anything.
I don't even know who you are.
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
You wanted Alison dead.
You wanted her dead.
You thought you got her pregnant.
I never hurt Alison.
I was writing a book about her.
A true crime book.
A book?
Yeah.
When I saw in the papers that she had gone missing,
I-- I couldn't stop thinking about it.
I had to get to the bottom of the story.
Did you know who I was when we met?
Yes, I did.
I knew who all of you were.
And that's why I applied to teach at Rosewood.
So that's what I was to you?
I was research?
When I saw you in the bar,
I took advantage of an opportunity
because I wanted to be a good reporter.
I wanted to be the guy
that would do anything for the story,
but I promise you though,
I didn't know I was going to fall in love with you.
Don't.
I've lied about a lot of things.
Ezra, don't!
I've lied about a lot of things.
But I have never lied to you, not once
about how I feel about you.
When we started getting serious,
I stopped writing the book.
I started my research back up again when we broke up
and that's how I knew that Alison was still alive.
When I think about how I defended you
to my family and my friends.
And the whole time you were...
you were using me.
I'm sorry, I'm such an idiot.
I'm such an idiot. I'm a jerk.
But I swear, I'll burn this, I'll trash it.
Burn it?
Burn it?
Are you kidding me?
I'm going to read this thing from cover to cover.
Aria, please don't.
No.
No, I want to know what was worth
destroying everything we had for.
Look.
No!
I was going to say you missed half the movie,
but that was like 20 minutes ago.
I'm sorry.
Kind of lost track of time.
Well, can we watch the rest?
I don't mind being a little lost.
Well, you won't be.
Movie is about a creepy guy who makes creepy sculptures
and acts creepy about it.
I'm gonna get a refill.
You want something?
No, thanks.
Aria?
Are you okay?
Toby.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Your mom was worried about you.
Why would my mom be worried about me?
She called me, looking for you.
I wish you could have told me what was really going on,
instead of me finding out this way.
Spencer? Is that you?
I guess I'll give you guys some time to talk.
This is for you.
There was a whole dinner that went with it, but...
doesn't matter.
Wait, Toby. Can you just wait a second?
I wasn't trying to ditch you.
Goodbye, Toby.
Thank you for coming over.
Good night, Mrs. Hastings.
Mom, why did you ask Toby here?
You promised.
You promised you wouldn't go back to this again.
Go back to what? I don't know what you mean.
Spencer, stop it.
Dr. Griggs's office called,
I know.
Mom, I'm sorry.
I can't go through this with you again.
I just don't think I have it in me.
It's not like last time though, I swear.
You didn't know what you were doing half the time.
And your father and I can't cover for you again,
not with Radley on your resume.
What's that supposed to mean?
I need to call your father. Let him know you're okay.
It sounds like Toby had a beautiful evening planned.
It's too bad you missed it.
