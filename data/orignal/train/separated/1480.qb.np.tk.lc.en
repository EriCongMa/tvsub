we got some bad news yesterday .
phil &apos;s mom died .
it wasn &apos;t unexpected .
he was with her .
and she went very peacefully and asleep .
she and i had a special connection .
we all did .
but mostly me .
she said i was just like her .
what ? is she weirdly competitive too ?
the whole family is going down to florida tomorrow
to be with phil for the service .
such a relieve .
i can feel how much he needs me right now .
there they are .
hey , guys .
oh , you brought my nap pillow .
i missed you so much .
phil , i &apos;m so sorry .
thanks .
grace was such a kind and whimsical soul .
the different animals she put antlers on for christmas cards--
inspired .
not a single one was photoshopped .
not even the alligator ?
cost her the tip of her pinkie ,
but she had no regrets .
i &apos;m so glad you guys are here .
i hope it wasn &apos;t too hard to get away from work .
no . please , anything for family .
anything to get me out of that office .
it &apos;s all boring paperwork and endless meetings .
honestly , this funeral could not have come at a better time .
aw , that &apos;s sweet . you should put that on the flowers .
gloria , you must be so hot in that .
i am in mourning .
in columbia , we take death very seriously .
where don &apos;t they ?
can we lose the veil ?
nobody &apos;s looking for you , gloria .
who is gloria ?
i am a wanted woman in florida .
i used to live there , and when i left ,
my roommate made our apartment into a house of prostitution ,
and my name was still on the lease .
it &apos;s like a traffic ticket .
you walk into court , pay a fine , it &apos;s done .
quick and easy .
yes , that was the name of the whorehouse .
mitchell , can you go with her to court ?
she &apos;s gonna need some sort of lawyer .
uh , you know , jay , mitchell is so burnt out right now .
he is in desperate need of a break .
bench warrants are a no @-@ brainer . and , i mean , come on .
does gloria really look like the kind of woman
who would run a brothel ?
yeah , i better go with her .
you should go .
yeah .
第四季 第二十四集
there they are !
oh , you look beautiful . hi , claire .
how are you holding on , hmm ?
oh , well , you know ...
we &apos;re getting through it . huh , dad ?
ah . i &apos;m doing okay . a little trouble sleeping .
i &apos;m so used to her snoring ,
i may have to borrow the neighbor &apos;s bulldog .
morning , charlotte !
this is my family from california !
i can tell . they all look like movie stars .
ah . oh , thank you .
that &apos;s nuts . i know that woman ,
but i have no idea from where .
yeah . this place is full of stories like that .
good morning , mr. dunphy , visitors .
please , shelley , call me frank .
no , sir .
that might be the way they do things at whistling pines ,
but we run a tight ship here at leisure park .
as per your request , i have reserved
the lakeside promenade this evening for one hour ,
beginning at 5 : 00 p.m. , for your memorial service .
may i remind you that there &apos;s no smoking on the grounds ,
no glass near the lake , no feeding the ducks ?
and i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
thank you .
no feeding the ducks .
what are you looking at me for ?
i love it here--
manicured lawns ,
planned activities , early dinners .
what more does a kid need ?
oh , yeah . and everyone &apos;s so polite and considerate--
nothing like the constant catfights in my circle ,
where every week ,
somebody &apos;s mad at somebody for god knows who what ,
and i &apos;m always thrown into the middle .
you seem tense . you know , they have a steam room .
wanna join me for a schvitz ?
please , it &apos;s florida .
if i wanna sweat more , i &apos;ll just move my arms .
you go have fun .
hey , you .
are you liking that book ?
well , it &apos;s not the worst thing i &apos;ve picked up at an airport ,
but close .
what is this ,
a book club or a miss america pageant ?
we &apos;re looking for our next book .
oh , what are you reading now ?
&quot; tempted by her innocent kiss . &quot;
i @-@ i &apos;m sure you don &apos;t know it .
oh , please . devon carter was ashley &apos;s first ,
she wants their passion to last ,
but her hopes of true love are crushed when she finds out
their marriage is just another one of daddy &apos;s business deals .
i &apos;m gay .
oh ! my grandson is gay .
his name is daniel schulman . uh , do you know him ?
oh ! is he about this tall , dark hair ,
circumcised ?
terrible .
don &apos;t be nervous , all right ?
i &apos;ll explain your situation .
we &apos;ll have you out of here in no time .
30 days in county jail .
what ?
ooh , she &apos;s tough .
next .
anita menchaca . petty theft .
mister , you &apos;re a lawyer ?
help me , please .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m her lawyer .
no , no , help her , so this will go faster .
and she reminds me of my abuela ,
with her head scarf and her petty theft charges .
here , your honor .
i &apos;m mitchell pritchett , attorney to miss manchego .
menchaca .
ah , yeah ...
are you ready to enter a plea ?
absolutely .
i see no reason why this matter should
take up any more of the court &apos;s valuable time .
not guilty , your honor .
why ?
gonna need a minute .
look what my dad just gave me .
please tell me that &apos;s not your mom .
no , no . she picked out her own urn .
my dad keeps saying
it &apos;s a size too small but she squeezed into it .
no , this is stuff she left for the kids .
can i ... open it ?
yeah .
wow . there &apos;s a note for you .
i can &apos;t read it .
okay .
would you ?
all right .
&quot; dear phil ,
you &apos;ve always been the most wonderful son ,
and now i need you to do one last thing for me . &quot;
oh , no !
she &apos;s gonna ask me to throw her ashes in the pope &apos;s face .
&quot; don &apos;t say anything to your father
because he &apos;ll just resist ,
but there &apos;s a woman named annie fitzsimmons
who lives a few streets over .
we don &apos;t know her very well , but i &apos;ve always admired her ,
and i think she &apos;d be perfect for your dad .
so before you go home ,
i want you to fix him up with her . &quot;
that is crazy !
&quot; i know this sounds crazy ,
but single men are in short supply here .
and a lot of scheming harpies will swoop in
before your father knows what hit him .
i love frank ,
but he &apos;ll follow anything with a casserole . &quot;
i don &apos;t believe this .
it &apos;s too soon ,
and my dad &apos;s not a cartoon bear .
he &apos;s perfectly capable of making intelligent decisions .
hey , guys ? i made cookies .
oh , good . i thought that was a neighbor .
hey , kids , your grandma left each of you something .
cool ! rockports !
it &apos;s just the box .
oh , my god . there &apos;s a letter .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m ready for this .
although if grandma wrote it ,
she must have sensed i was ready .
because you had such a bond ?
you felt it , too ?
haley , why don &apos;t you tell us what yours says ?
well , it &apos;s so sweet .
it &apos;s about how beautiful i am inside and--
score ! jewelry
check it out !
oh , look at that .
your grandma loved pocket watches .
aw ! she said they made a man look dignified .
is this chain in case you swallow it ?
no , but suddenly i &apos;m glad it &apos;s there .
a lighter ?
huh . what does the note say ?
&quot; this is a lighter . &quot;
i don &apos;t understand .
how much clearer could she have been ?
i wouldn &apos;t read too much into it .
your grandma loved you very much .
she just did a couple of bizarre things towards the end .
here , alex , i can help you out with that .
you are getting very sleepy .
a crappy old lighter is not a sucky gift .
honey , hey , hey . so you &apos;re not gonna do what your mom asked ?
marry off my dad to a complete stranger
on the day of her funeral ? i think not .
it was her last wish .
when my dad is ready ,
he gets to pick his own girlfriend .
that &apos;s the big upside to your wife dying .
also , not having to think before you speak .
yeah .
your honor , it all boils down to this .
the motel owes miss menchengo--
menchaca .
damn it . every time .
more in wages than she ever could &apos;ve taken
in soaps and tiny shampoos .
fine . case dismissed .
yes !
oh ! gracias ! muchas gracias !
de nada . de nada .
muchas gracias .
did you see that ? i won !
i @-@ i can &apos;t believe it !
yeah .
it scares me that winning is such a surprise for you .
next ! matthew plonsker . parking violations .
i thought i &apos;d be a little rusty , but apparently not .
oh ! really ? sweet .
yes ! go make your mistakes with him .
i don &apos;t want to go to jail for prostitution .
like you could afford me .
it seems to me it wasn &apos;t only the meter
that was broken that fateful afternoon .
nay !
it was the entire criminal justice system .
therefore i submit to you ,
the only &quot; influence &quot; my client was under that night
was his love of boating .
shame !
i just don &apos;t get it . why would she give me a lighter ?
maybe she wants you to burn all your clothes .
is it possible we didn &apos;t have the connection i thought we did ?
i don &apos;t know . you heard dad .
she was on all that medication towards the end .
people do weird things when they &apos;re on drugs .
when dylan was on vicodin after his root canal ,
he bought the complete dvd set of &quot; dr. quinn medicine woman . &quot;
get going , ladies .
the pool &apos;s for residents only .
oh , okay . sorry . we &apos;ll leave .
uh , no , we won &apos;t . there &apos;s nobody here .
haley !
why can &apos;t we use the pool ?
because those are the rules .
are we gonna have a problem here ?
you don &apos;t scare me . i &apos;ve been in real jail .
oh , you two are pretty smart , aren &apos;t you ?
no . only she is .
north .
flowers .
red .
one dot .
two bam .
i have mahj !
hee hee !
again ? !
wow , you &apos;re really on some streak , edith .
luck of the tiles .
anyone else want some punch ?
yeah . i &apos;ll join you .
you are very good .
where &apos;d a farm boy like you learn to play mahjong ?
oh , well , one summer ,
i worked at the central missouri b &apos;nai b &apos;rith .
it &apos;s the nation &apos;s smallest chapter .
listen , marilyn ,
i don &apos;t mean to stir things up ,
but i just saw edith take the winning tile out of her jacket pocket .
i knew it !
nobody &apos;s that good !
listen , i &apos;m as shocked as you are .
it just doesn &apos;t seem like edith .
yeah , well , it goes to show , you think you know someone ...
what happened to all the cookies ?
oh , well , you know i hate to stir things up ...
excuse me .
yes ?
jay pritchett .
frank dunphy &apos;s son is married to my daughter .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
ah , he grows on you .
oh , you &apos;re talking about the death . thank you .
you look very familiar to me . did you ever live in ohio ?
no . i &apos;m from pensacola .
and then it hit me .
i had done my basic training in pensacola .
she was my first .
i &apos;ll never forget her-- charlotte somebody .
i was 18 , and she was 31 .
and we fell pretty hard for each other .
i always felt bad i never called her
when i got back from vietnam .
especially because by then i had , you know ...
learned a few things .
i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;ll have to forgive me .
my memory isn &apos;t what it used to be .
i was in the navy . jay pritchett .
little more up here ,
little less down here .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re a very nice man ,
but i @-@ i think you may have mistaken me for someone else .
i was shipping off to vietnam .
you had the ass of a young ann margret .
yeah , that was me .
grandma looks so happy here .
yeah . we were pretty hammered .
that was last 4th of july-- grandma &apos;s favorite holiday .
the plimptons had a barbecue ,
and gram and i got a little tipsy on ginger margaritas .
we came home for a catnap
and slept right through the big fireworks show .
first one she ever missed .
boy , was she mad .
i made it up to her
with a little fireworks show of our own later .
grandpa !
a couple of glow sticks and a slingshot in the backyard .
which led to some pretty memorable lovemaking .
not to change the subject ,
but i don &apos;t really get the gift grandma left me .
well , didn &apos;t she explain it in the note ?
no . the note &apos;s four words .
you know it opens , right ?
it does ?
sure . look , it &apos;s florida . everything sticks together .
it &apos;s all so weird .
this thing you dread in the back of your mind
suddenly becomes real .
i know .
i feel better having you here , though .
oh , i &apos;m always here for you .
look at that house .
that is a cute house .
i wonder who lives there .
i don &apos;t know .
claire , what are you doing ?
i love this house .
i bet you anything i would love whoever lives here .
wait a minute .
that lady from my mom &apos;s letter lives here , doesn &apos;t she ?
annie fitzsimmons .
phil , listen to me .
you may have your reasons for not wanting to do this ,
but your mother was a very wise woman .
she believed that whoever is behind that door
would make your father happy for the rest of his life .
yeah . what can i do for you ?
she &apos;s perfect .
i thought annie fitzsimmons lived here .
she does . annie , honey !
there &apos;s people here to see ya !
hi .
hi .
can i help you ?
we &apos;re selling vacuum cleaners .
that is strange .
i know .
because just this morning , my vacuum cleaner broke .
that &apos;s on me . i shed like a collie .
let &apos;s see what you got .
yes , claire , let &apos;s see what you got .
i didn &apos;t bring it .
you didn &apos;t bring it ?
no .
you had it when we left the vacuum cleaner office .
i guess it &apos;s fair to say you &apos;ve made a huge mistake .
no . say it .
i &apos;m sorry to do that . it &apos;s part of the training .
i &apos;ve made a huge mistake .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s gonna work out .
that &apos;s mahj again !
oh ! well , shocker .
that &apos;s it . you &apos;re cheating .
i am not .
oh , please ! you &apos;ve stashed more tiles
than marilyn has cookies !
o @-@ okay . uh , let &apos;s just take a breath .
who cares about tiles or cookies
or whatever hattie &apos;s slipping into her coffee ?
i knew you were drinking again !
that &apos;s how she lost her license .
you shut your traps !
drop dead !
screw you !
yeah , you , too ! ladies .
and you !
ladies .
stop it ! you--stop it .
you have been friends for 20 years .
what on earth has gotten into you all ?
why does drama keep following me everywhere i go ?
it just keeps popping up out of nowhere .
like crispin &apos;s hair plugs .
and so we went to your apartment .
it &apos;s still embarrassing .
i told you i had never been with a woman .
and you took me by the hand and you led me into the bedroom .
you were so sweet and beautiful .
i thought i &apos;d gone to heaven .
jay pritchett .
yes ! yes !
i remember that .
you were so handsome .
i don &apos;t know about that .
i mean , cute , maybe .
i--people talk about my eyes .
but i always regretted not getting in touch with you when i got back ,
because you had given me something
that i cherished for almost 50 years .
you gave me something , too .
i did ?
you wait right there .
i &apos;m down there for a funeral--
it &apos;s such a sad event--
and i end up finding something that i thought was lost forever .
this beautiful moment
that meant so much to both of us ,
set against the backdrop of fighting commies .
there &apos;s your movie .
i remember exactly where i was when you gave it to me .
you said , &quot; wear this bec-- &quot;
no , no . this isn &apos;t mine .
and i never went to jefferson high .
oh . my mistake .
here it is .
you said , &quot; pin this-- &quot;
no , no . n @-@ no .
never got a medal .
and , uh ...
this is the wrong branch of service .
of course .
these are th--
never wrote .
why don &apos;t you look through here ?
turns out she sent more men off to war
than lyndon johnson .
well , we &apos;re here .
you wanna try to sell my dad a vacuum ?
tease me all you want .
i am glad that we at least tried .
i know you mean well , but he &apos;s gonna be fine on his own .
so funny .
ooh ! here . try mine , frank .
i bet it &apos;s delicious .
if your taste buds are dead .
dead ? real sensitive , myra .
the woman &apos;s not even cold ...
unlike your eggplant parm .
what is going on ?
oh , it &apos;s a feeding frenzy . they &apos;re all over him .
they &apos;re practically measuring the windows for new drapes .
it &apos;s disgusting .
i must get this recipe , myra .
oh , sure .
you want the recipe ? it &apos;s thaw , heat , and serve .
my mom was right . they &apos;re gonna eat him alive .
do you think we can break up
annie fitzsimmons and her boyfriend ?
boyfriend ?
oh , you mean marv ? oh , that &apos;s hilarious .
marv &apos;s her brother , visiting from pompano .
he &apos;s here for the week ,
slept with half the women in this place .
she &apos;s single ? this is fantastic .
cam , how do you know that ?
this place is lousy with gossips .
next . gloria delgado ?
i &apos;m here !
conspiring to promote prostitution . how do you plead ?
not guilty , your honor .
oh , good . it &apos;s you .
your majesty , i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
but i will say that i am guilty
if i can just pay the fine and go home .
no , you won &apos;t .
you &apos;re innocent , and i can prove it .
your honor , this document here shows
that my client was a resident of california at the time .
and these canceled checks prove
that she was legally subletting the apartment in question .
i might be a simple man , but i do know one thing ...
if a dog don &apos;t bark--
okay , i can &apos;t listen to him anymore .
case dismissed . court adjourned .
gracias , mitchell ! you &apos;re wonderful !
you know what ? we got lucky
because i had no ending to that dog thing .
if you don &apos;t have anything to do next week ,
maybe you can go with me to texas .
hello again .
oh , no . you &apos;re alone .
did you fire that nice girl ?
no . she &apos;s not a nice girl . she &apos;s my wife .
and we don &apos;t sell vacuums .
thank god . you &apos;d starve .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m actually phil dunphy .
i @-@ i &apos;m frank and grace dunphy &apos;s son .
oh , i heard about your mom . i &apos;m--i &apos;m so sorry .
thank you .
i only met her a few times ,
but she seemed like a lovely woman .
but i &apos;m still confused .
well , this probably won &apos;t help , but , um ...
her last request was for me to fix you up with my dad .
oh , my .
yeah . i really wish i sold vacuums .
so earlier ...
we were thrown when your brother answered the door .
we thought he was your boyfriend .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
really ? this is such a @-@ a normal request i &apos;m making .
please , by the way , don &apos;t feel pressured at all .
my dad doesn &apos;t even know about this .
i @-@ i just--i had to tell you . it &apos;s what she wanted .
she was always doing crazy stuff like this ...
going out of her way to take care of us .
i coughed on the phone once ,
and she overnighted me soup .
when i wanted to learn how to ski , she knit me a sweater .
when i wanted to be a marine biologist ,
she knit me a sweater with a whale on it .
who does that ?
that &apos;s just the kind of person she is .
was .
oh , sweetie .
you &apos;re a good son .
she was right . you are very nice .
it &apos;s a beautiful service .
it really makes you think about how you wanna live your life .
i wanna quit my job and get back into the courtroom .
what ?
just--just don &apos;t say anything to anyone .
well , who am i gonna tell ?
thank you , mel .
that was beautiful .
um , before we say good night ,
my daughter alex would like to pay tribute .
thanks , sweetie .
my grandmother and i had a very special bond .
seriously ? again ?
this may not make sense to everyone ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure she would &apos;ve loved it .
&quot; this is a lighter .
it belonged to my favorite actor , paul newman .
one day , he came into the restaurant where i was waitressing
and accidentally left it behind .
for the first time in my life ,
i did something i wasn &apos;t supposed to
and slipped it into my pocket .
one of the customers saw
and said , &apos; don &apos;t worry . your secret &apos;s safe with me.&apos;
that customer turned out to be the love of my life ,
your grandfather .
so , my alex , who i love so dearly ,
who is probably too much like me for her own good ,
every once in a while ,
don &apos;t be afraid to break the rules .
you never know what can happen . &quot;
how &apos; bout this weather ?
yep . they say it &apos;s supposed to rain .
we need it .
muriel .
are you two packed up and ready to go ?
yep .
where does the time go ?
darned if i know .
everyone &apos;s always in such a hurry .
and why ? we &apos;re all gonna end up in the same place .
well , i guess we better mosey .
