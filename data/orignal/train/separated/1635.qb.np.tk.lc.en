第六季 第二十集
i was reading about this jellyfish that never dies .
instead , it reverts to its asexual state
and then grows up again .
we thought my 90 @-@ year @-@ old grandfather
had reverted to an asexual state ,
but the lawsuit from his jamaican caregiver
proved us all wrong .
my point is , immortality is not only a possibility ,
it is real .
only if you &apos;re this jellyfish
which periodically reverts to a mass of
undifferentiated protoplasm .
if i could keep my gmail account ,
i &apos;d be okay with that .
hello , fellas .
remember when we were trying to figure out what that smell
coming from professor tupperman &apos;s office was ?
yeah ?
turns out it was tupperman .
dead at his desk for two weeks .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s terrible .
in lieu of flowers , the department chair
is asking that everyone donate a bottle of febreze .
if we &apos;re going to change the topic from jellyfish ,
i &apos;d be okay with brine shrimp
or the history of the unicycle .
show a little compassion-- a man died .
and turned into a puddle of goo .
now , we can either sit around
and cry over spilt professor , or ...
we can rejoice in the knowledge
that a tenured position has just opened up .
i choose to do the latter .
excuse me , the whole tenure system is ridiculous .
a guaranteed job for life
only encourages the faculty to become complacent .
if we really want science to advance ,
people should have chips implanted in their skulls
that explode when they say something stupid .
well , i believe people do their best work
when they feel safe and secure .
if you need my nose , you &apos;ll find it firmly lodged
up the rectum of the tenure committee .
you ph.d &apos;s gonna go suck up like kripke ?
no .
i mean , i &apos;ll apply ,
but i &apos;m not gonna stoop to playing politics .
yeah , me neither .
it should be about the work .
and if i can &apos;t get tenure ,
i &apos;d like to see you or sheldon get it .
raj , don &apos;t dangle false hope
in front of leonard like that .
excuse me ,
but i think i &apos;m just as qualified as you are .
so &quot; tenured &quot; means a job for life ?
yup .
and you can &apos;t get fired
even if you &apos;re bad at it ?
mm , not really .
wow , sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress
at the cheesecake factory .
while i disagree with the premise of tenure ,
if they gave it to me ,
it wouldn &apos;t diminish my output .
you know , i &apos;m like the sun .
can &apos;t turn this off .
are rajesh and leonard competing for it as well ?
do they know they don &apos;t stand a chance
&apos;cause you &apos;re so great ?
well put .
you know , i must say i go back and forth
on this boyfriend @-@ girlfriend thing ,
but those moments when you worship me
really keep you in the running .
it would be nice to have the increased income .
stop taking money from my parents .
money from family does come with strings attached .
you have no idea .
they buy me a new bmw for my birthday
but can i get seat warmers ?
no .
&quot; rajesh , if you want a warm butt ,
you &apos;re gonna have to pay for it yourself . &quot;
well , maybe i will , old man !
i think that &apos;s enough wine for now .
i just keep thinking about how cool it would be
if i called my mom and told her
that i got tenure at caltech .
she &apos;d be proud , huh ?
oh , very .
assuming she takes my call .
my primary concern with being granted tenure
is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact .
i might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow .
or a chainsaw .
or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability
and move out ...
buy a house ...
get married ...
start a family .
yeah , or ...
the chainsaw .
and i will return to new delhi in triumph
atop a bejeweled white elephant !
and you know what will be on that elephant &apos;s back ?
a seat warmer .
&quot; no , father , you may not have a ride ! &quot;
i &apos;m gonna make some coffee .
so , who do you have to schmooze to get this deal ?
i &apos;m not gonna schmooze anybody .
i &apos;m gonna let my work speak for itself .
that &apos;s great .
that shows a lot of integrity .
thank you .
i &apos;m a naive idiot , right ?
oh , good , you heard me .
you know , if you really want tenure ,
maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision .
sheldon cooper does not do &quot; cozy . &quot;
you don &apos;t say .
but i suppose it wouldn &apos;t hurt
to know who &apos;s on the committee .
let &apos;s see ...
oh , janine davis .
oh , dear .
is that a problem ?
yeah , even you .
you &apos;re a slave .
i &apos;m a what ?
i &apos;m not sure ; it could go either way .
hey . mrs. davis .
dr. hofstadter .
just thought i &apos;d come down
and start getting ready for swimsuit season .
good for you .
not that you need it .
i bet you look great in a swimsuit .
thank you .
i &apos;ve got what my father used to call &quot; furniture disease . &quot;
my chest is falling into my drawers .
i &apos;m not , uh , familiar with this model .
how do i make it start ?
you push start .
right .
this one might be broken .
you have to move .
got it .
there .
oh , yeah !
yeah , now i &apos;m feeling it .
oh , this is great .
i could do this for the rest of my life .
hey , speaking ...
speaking of things you do for the rest of your life ...
uh , did i read that you &apos;re on that @-@ that tenure committee ?
yep .
i got to get a home gym .
well , i &apos;m sure you have a lot of
good applicants , i just
wanted to say hi and ...
let you know that i &apos;ll be ...
throwing my hat in the ...
... ring .
all right , i &apos;ll keep an eye out for that .
yeah .
hey , hofstadter .
funny seeing you here for the first time in ...
ever .
go ... away .
janine the machine , let &apos;s do this !
hey , barry .
well , look at that .
burned a whole calorie .
i guess you got here early
to burn off that banana bread i baked you .
yeah , it was delicious . thank you .
no , my pleasure .
oh , if you ... if you like banana bread ...
i &apos;ve got a @-@ a great recipe .
the trick is in ... in fresh ground ...
i &apos;ll e @-@ mail it to you .
all right , i &apos;m warm .
ready to kick it up a notch ?
let &apos;s go .
that &apos;s enough cardio for me .
i &apos;m just ... gonna stretch out
before i hit the weights .
you okay ?
call someone !
good day , mrs. davis .
this is dr. rajesh koothrappali
from the astrophysics department .
don &apos;t be alarmed ,
i &apos;m not really in space .
anyhoo ...
i &apos;d like to take this opportunity
to tell you about myself ,
so sit back , relax and enjoy
the following 90 @-@ minute video .
oh , come on .
born in new delhi ,
the third son of an itinerant gynecologist ,
i showed early signs of genius .
at the age of five , i discovered a celestial object
which later turned out to be the moon .
mrs. davis ? mrs. davis ?
mrs. davis ?
god , they &apos;re everywhere .
come in .
dr. cooper , how can i help you ?
yes , hello . i &apos;m fine . um ...
i understand you may have a bad impression of me ,
so i bought you a gift .
uh , dr. cooper , that &apos;s not necessary .
it &apos;s too late .
get ready to like me .
roots ?
the tragic history of slavery in america .
fun for the whole family .
why would you think this is an appropriate gift ?
you are black , right ?
this meeting has come to an end .
because you want to start watching it right now .
copy that .
let &apos;s see .
up next on the tenure committee is ...
professor wu .
well , get ready for the complete works of jackie chan .
gentlemen .
where have you been ?
nurse &apos;s office .
asthma attack ?
asthma , heart-- some kind of attack .
i &apos;m fine , though .
you guys going to professor tupperman &apos;s memorial ?
i don &apos;t know .
probably not .
barely knew him .
yeah , you wouldn &apos;t want to look like
you guys are brown @-@ nosing the tenure committee ,
who will all be there .
oh , yeah , that &apos;s what i was hoping for-- meerkats .
i won &apos;t be able to make our date night this thursday , so ...
bad news for you .
you better have a good excuse this time ,
because &quot; trimming q @-@ tips to fit your ears right &quot;
is obvious nonsense .
first of all , when you say things like that ,
people think you &apos;re crazy .
second , the reason i &apos;m cancelling is because
i have to attend a memorial service for professor tupperman .
it sounds like a long and tedious evening .
eh , it will be .
honestly , if i must endure a long and tedious evening ,
i &apos;d rather it be with you on date night .
but i have no choice .
the tenure committee &apos;s going to be there .
well , in that case , perhaps i should come along .
well , now that i think about it ,
that would be most helpful .
of course it would .
i &apos;m well @-@ versed in academic politics ,
and as a respected scientist ,
i can only raise your stock as a candidate .
actually , i meant you could drive me .
but if it makes you happy , that other stuff , too .
do anything interesting today ?
oh , not really .
i was out shopping with amy .
she wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing .
wait-- sheldon &apos;s going to be there ?
we all promised we weren &apos;t going to go .
oh , what a jerk .
i know .
i was hoping to go without anyone finding out .
well , since amy &apos;s going , do you want me there ?
you know , to support you ?
that &apos;s nice , but it @-@ it &apos;s just gonna be
a room full of boring old men
and i &apos;m not sure how much help you &apos;d be .
okay .
i &apos;m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that .
oh , yeah . no . thanks ,
that would be great help .
you realize you might kill some of them .
oh , then you all can get tenure .
come on , daddy .
all the other scientists have seat warmers .
this is so humiliating .
i &apos;ve got to get tenure .
okay , l @-@ let &apos;s meet halfway .
how about i cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week ?
looks like we &apos;re both going to be living like animals .
let &apos;s go over our emotional responses one last time .
okay .
professor tupperman is dead ,
and that makes us ... ?
sad .
the fact that there are so many people
here tonight doesn &apos;t make us cranky and claustrophobic .
it makes us ... ?
glad .
giving mrs. davis the box set of roots was ... ?
bad .
however ...
no .
fine . bad .
unbelievable .
you have some nerve showing up here
just to schmooze with the tenure committee .
you &apos;re here .
excuse me .
i &apos;m here to pay my respects to professor ... tupperware ,
or whatever his name is .
so am i.
his passing makes me feel ... bad .
well , well , well , sheldon ,
fancy meeting you here .
i guess the train store in glendale
wasn &apos;t having a cotillion after all .
and you-- you said you weren &apos;t coming here , either .
i have a thick accent . you don &apos;t know what i said .
i &apos;d like to know why penny &apos;s here .
i &apos;m here to support my man , just like you .
what are you going to do ?
take people &apos;s drink orders and get them wrong ?
do it .
what ? did she do it yet ?
she plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee
to further leonard &apos;s cause .
well , that &apos;s a fine how @-@ do @-@ you @-@ do .
don &apos;t just stand there . take your breasts out .
ooh , meerkat fight !
you &apos;re all wasting your time .
sheldon is the most qualified for the job ,
and no amount of gravity @-@ defying bosom &apos;s
going to change that .
seriously , is that tape ?
like , how are they staying up like that ?
way to hit them with both barrels .
you two should be ashamed of yourselves .
using women to advance your cause with sexuality ,
and whatever amy plans on doing .
are you implying that my girlfriend
has no sexuality to exploit ?
yes !
okay , because that was not clear .
sheldon !
what ? that was ambiguous .
well , now it &apos;s biguous .
what are you gonna do about it ?
you could talk some smack about his mother .
well , yes , of course , he wouldn &apos;t like that at all .
last night ,
i was feeling in need of sexual release
when i happened to come across your mother .
okay , okay .
guys , what are we doing here ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing ,
but i was about to insinuate
that i had coitus with raj &apos;s mother for a dollar .
oh , you do what you want ,
but i don &apos;t want to lose my friends over tenure .
friends are forever .
so is tenure .
walk !
i &apos;m just gonna go home
and let my work speak for itself .
you &apos;re right . this is beneath me .
like your mother was last night .
how about it , sheldon ?
what do you think i should do ?
well , you &apos;ll always be an academic success ,
but ...
i seriously question
whether you &apos;ll make any more friends .
i don &apos;t want any more , but let &apos;s go .
are you kidding ?
i would &quot; wove &quot; to baby @-@ sit for you .
i could not ask you to do that .
nonsense . children &quot; wove &quot; me .
something about me just makes them &quot; waugh &quot; and &quot; waugh . &quot;
no . we cannot lose to that jerk .
yeah , screw it .
i &apos;m going in .
you ... wait . hold on .
i believe &quot; screw it , i &apos;m going in &quot; is what
i said to your mother last night .
don &apos;t worry , i didn &apos;t really say that .
i @-@ i find the concept
of coitus ridiculous and off @-@ putting .
should have taken my breasts out while i had the chance .
mrs. davis ?
mrs. davis ?
mrs. davis ?
i know you &apos;re in there .
i saw your car in the parking lot .
what ?
i just found out that you recommended myself ,
dr. hofstadter and dr. koothrappali
to be on the short list for tenure .
well , despite your quirks ,
the three of you are very accomplished
in your respective fields .
i don &apos;t know what you mean by &quot; quirks , &quot; but , um ...
... i do want to express my gratitude .
you didn &apos;t bring another gift , did you ?
no , no .
no , i learned my lesson .
i understand that was inappropriate .
good .
anyway , thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i &apos;m gonna pretend that didn &apos;t happen .
yeah , right on , sister .
