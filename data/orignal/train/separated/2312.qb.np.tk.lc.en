for over a century , i have lived in secret until now .
i know the risk , but i have to know her .
elena , she &apos;s a dead ringer for katherine .
hello , brother .
damon .
he killed zach .
he killed tanner . he turned vicki .
i have to kill him .
no , you can &apos;t do that .
you were right to stay away from me .
what is that ?
very important crystal .
that belonged to one of the most powerful
witches of our family , emily bennett .
i want my crystal back .
bonnie has it .
get it from her .
don &apos;t be giving that back to anybody .
today we &apos;re going to talk about shadow reckoning .
this is a method of measuring heights
by the sun &apos;s shadow .
let &apos;s say , for example , that we &apos;re going
to measure the distance of the shadow .
we &apos;re gonna take this measurement here ,
measure the length ,
and we &apos;re going to multiply that the height of the source .
building height can also be measured using a kilometer .
which we are going to make it in class tomorrow .
i &apos;m going to give you a hand @-@ out about ...
hello ?
please help me .
who are you ?
i &apos;m emily .
you know that .
we are family .
where am i ?
this is where it started .
and this is where it has to end .
no . this isn &apos;t real .
help me .
what are you looking at ?
turn around .
have you even talked to bonnie ?
no . i &apos;m mad at her . she needs to make the first move .
be the bigger person .
impossible in her presence .
why are you so pissed at her , anyway ?
she &apos;s a thief . that &apos;s why .
i gave her my necklace , and she refuses to give it back .
it &apos;s a matter of principle .
all right . well , i tried .
i &apos;m officially out of it .
good . your turn .
where &apos;s stefan ? have you talked to him ?
he &apos;s avoiding me .
why ?
it &apos;s complicated .
i &apos;ll see you later .
bye .
good morning , everyone .
alrighty .
let &apos;s see .
... a @-@ r @-@ i @-@ c
s @-@ a @-@ l @-@ t @-@ z @-@ m @-@ a @-@ n .
alaric saltzman .
it &apos;s a mouthful . i know .
doesn &apos;t exactly roll off the tongue .
saltzman is of german origins .
my family emigrated here in 1755 to texas .
i , however , was born and raised in boston .
now , the name alaric
belongs to a very dead great @-@ grandfather
i will never be able to thank enough .
you &apos;ll probably want to pronounce it &quot; ala @-@ ric , &quot;
but it &apos;s &quot; a @-@ lar @-@ ic , &quot; ok ?
so you can call me rick .
i &apos;m your new history teacher .
rise and shine .
you &apos;ll be late for school .
what are you ... what are you doin &apos; ?
peace offering .
come on . you need it for blood circulation .
does dead flesh good .
all right , i &apos;m sorry .
step aside , please .
i got the town off our back .
it was for the greater good , but i &apos;m sorry .
and to prove it , i &apos;m not gonna feed on a human
for at least a week .
i &apos;ll adopt the stefan diet ,
only nothin &apos; with feathers .
&apos;cause i realize that killing your closest
and oldest friend is beyond evil ,
and yet somehow , it &apos;s worthy of humor .
are you mimicking me ?
yes , stefan . now that the secret society
of vampire haters is off our back ,
i can go back to my routine
of how can i destroy stefan &apos;s life this week .
and i can go back to sulking and elena @-@ longing
and forehead brooding . this is fun . i like this .
and i will finally reveal the ulterior motive
behind my evil and diabolical return to mystic falls .
yeah . i &apos;m done .
that &apos;s just like you , damon .
always have to have the last word .
and then i ended up at the remains
of old fell &apos;s church before i woke up back in the woods .
and you always see your ancestor emily ?
huh .
do you believe in ghosts ?
2 weeks ago , i &apos;d say no , but now ...
i think i &apos;m being haunted .
i don &apos;t get it . why emily ?
grams said she was a powerful
witch back in the civil war day .
and that this medallion was hers ,
a witch &apos;s talisman .
and it all started when you got the necklace ?
i think she &apos;s using it to communicate with me .
ok , what does grams say about it ?
i can &apos;t call her . she &apos;s gonna tell me to embrace it .
i don &apos;t want to embrace it . i want it to stop .
hey , mr. saltzman , i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;m jeremy gilbert .
you wanted to see me ?
you know that your old teacher
had a jackass file ?
no joke . it &apos;s , uh , typed on a label .
it has all the , uh , troublemakers in it ,
but really it &apos;s just an opus to you .
don &apos;t worry about it .
i &apos;m not him .
clean slate .
now ...
let &apos;s talk about grades .
i know it &apos;s been a rough couple of months ,
but i &apos;ve been ... i &apos;ve been trying to turn them around .
yeah , i saw that ,
but the problem is
we &apos;re halfway through a semester ,
and half a fail is still pretty bleak .
this is the part where you say to me ,
&quot; what can i do to ? i wanna change that . &quot;
well , i &apos;m glad you asked .
how do you feel about extra credit ?
yeah . yeah , totally . whatever .
good . write me a paper then .
ok . about what ?
history .
pick a topic . keep it local .
no wikipedia regurgita .
these old towns have a lot of rich history ,
so just get your hands dirty ,
make it sing , and you &apos;re back on track .
deal ?
uh , yeah . deal .
that &apos;s a , uh ... that &apos;s a cool ring .
oh , thanks . it was my father &apos;s .
heh . llittle garish , but family .
you know .
you &apos;ve got a week .
hey .
hey . what is that ?
what is what ?
the &quot; hey . &quot;
it was twice . that is 2 heys . that ...
do you have any other words in your vocabulary ?
what &apos;s wrong with &quot; hey &quot; ?
it reeks of awkward subtext .
you spent the night in my bed ,
there was cuddling , and then you snuck out before dawn
so you wouldn &apos;t have to face me ,
which i must say is a total lame guy
move that i did not appreciate
and now with the heys ?
seriously ? i mean ,
i may have been some pathetic ,
insecure mess at the party
but do not mistake that for me being a pushover ,
because i do not let guys mess with my head anymore .
i heard your mom in the morning ,
and i didn &apos;t want to get you in trouble ,
so i went out the window .
you went out the window ? well , another lame guy move .
your mom &apos;s the sheriff .
and as for the heys , i &apos;m pretty sure
it &apos;s what i &apos;ve said to you every day since the first grade .
oh .
tryin &apos; to read somethin &apos; into it ...
lame girl move .
you weren &apos;t in class . i was worried .
yeah , i got your messages , and sorry
i didn &apos;t get back to you
what i wanna say shouldn &apos;t be said over the phone .
a simple &quot; i didn &apos;t kill my
brother &quot; text would have sufficed .
i didn &apos;t kill my brother ,
as much as he deserved it .
he has you to thank for that .
so what did you wanna tell me ?
i won &apos;t be coming to school anymore .
i &apos;m gonna back off and keep my distance .
it &apos;s the right thing to do .
back off from school or ...
from me ?
thank you for telling me .
it &apos;s better this way .
yep . i got it .
you &apos;re angry .
that &apos;s good .
be easier if you hate me .
ok , it &apos;s your last chance .
i &apos;m gonna scream .
oh , no , don &apos;t do that .
let &apos;s stay on point .
listen , i want my necklace .
you can &apos;t have it .
well , i can &apos;t take it , but you can give it to me .
i &apos;m trying to help you here .
i don &apos;t want your help .
you do want my help , and you don &apos;t even know it .
you know why , you little witch ?
&apos;cause you have stumbled into something
you need to stumble out of .
just leave me alone , or i swear i &apos;ll ...
ooh . don &apos;t . no threats .
look @-@ a ... you hurt me last time .
b ... i wish you no harm .
believe it or not , bonnie , i wanna protect you .
let me help you get emily off your back .
how do you know about her ?
i know a lot of things
and i know more about that crystal than you do
and i know that she &apos;s using it
to creep inside of you .
see how scared you are ?
and you should be , because i will get that crystal ,
even if i have to wait for emily to give it to me herself .
so next time she comes out to play
you tell her ...
that deal &apos;s a deal .
he &apos;s bad news , elena .
he really scared me .
you need to stay as far away from damon as possible .
i &apos;m trying. he just keeps showing up .
i don &apos;t want you to be alone .
you &apos;re sleeping at my place tonight .
we can make a whole night out of it .
where are you going ?
are you ok ?
now i am .
all my problems were because of that thing .
can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t do that sooner .
what &apos;s your grams gonna say ?
grams isn &apos;t the one being haunted
by a 150 @-@ year @-@ old ghost , is she ?
ok , then .
i like a man who can dine alone .
a quiet strength .
i thought you were still
in that whole logan depression thing .
oh , i &apos;ve sworn off men forever
but it doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t observe
them from a safe distance .
well , i can introduce you .
thanks for coming .
i wouldn &apos;t have called if it wasn &apos;t important .
i know that .
he threatened her , stefan .
what would damon want with bonnie ?
she has this necklace. caroline got it from damon
and she gave it bonnie
and now damon wants it back .
he &apos;s tormenting her .
over a necklace .
it &apos;s not just any necklace .
it has to do with bonnie &apos;s heritage .
it belonged to one of her ancestors
who lived here during the civil war .
when you and damon lived here .
her name was emily .
she was katherine &apos;s handmaid
and a witch .
you know ?
about bonnie ?
the first night that you invited me over
for dinner , i made the connection .
and now damon knows
and for some reason , he wants that necklace .
what does it look like ?
it &apos;s , um , an antique iron setting with a ...
with an amber crystal .
i know it . it belonged to katherine .
emily gave it to her , which means that ...
what ?
i don &apos;t know
but i &apos;m gonna find out .
let me talk to damon .
will he tell you ?
i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll get it out of him .
have you picked a topic ?
no , not yet . it &apos;s gotta be local
and non @-@ internet research , so ...
well , that &apos;s easy . you got all your dad &apos;s stuff .
what stuff ?
how the gilberts came over
on the &quot; mayflower &quot; stuff
all that family lineage from way back .
your dad really loved all that family history stuff .
it &apos;s all boxed up in the closet .
mr. saltzman .
hey . what &apos;s up , man ?
this is my aunt jenna .
alaric saltzman. it &apos;s nice to meet you .
jeremy was just telling me about his paper .
thanks for giving him another chance .
oh , you know , it was my first day .
i wanted to make a good impression .
so , stefan ...
you know , i been thinking ...
i think we should start over
give this brother thing another chance .
we used to do it oh , so well once upon a time .
i don &apos;t , damon .
i can &apos;t trust you to be a nice guy .
you ... you kill everybody , and you &apos;re so mean .
you &apos;re so mean , and ...
you &apos;re really hard to imitate ,
and then i have to go to that lesser place .
can i get a coffee , please ?
so what &apos;s with the bottle ?
i &apos;m on edge . crash diet ,
and i &apos;m trying to keep a low profile .
mm . you could always just leave ,
find a new town to turn into your own personal gas &apos; n &apos; sip .
i &apos;ll manage .
you know , you don &apos;t have to keep an eye on me .
i &apos;m not here to keep an eye on you .
so why are you here ?
why not ?
i &apos;m sorry .
there . i said it .
if you want the ugly @-@ ass necklace ,
keep it .
it &apos;s yours .
will you hate me if i tell you i threw it away ?
you threw it away ?
i know it sounds crazy ,
but the necklace was giving me nightmares .
i had to get rid of it .
you could have just given it back to me .
why ? so you could give it back to damon ?
screw damon .
are we doing manicures or what ?
who has their kit ?
mine &apos;s in my bag .
so , elena ... hmm ?
how long do you think this fight with stefan &apos;s gonna last ?
is it like a permanent thing ?
i don &apos;t know , caroline .
heh . why are you such a little liar , bonnie ?
what ?
caroline !
i &apos;m not lying to you , caroline . i swear .
it &apos;s true . i watched her throw it into a field .
well , then explain it .
emily .
who &apos;s emily ?
the ghost .
oh , the ghost has a name now ?
caroline , please .
i wonder why she won &apos;t leave me alone .
ok , what is going on ?
why am i not a part of this conversation ?
you guys do this to me all the time .
that &apos;s not true .
yes , it is .
i can &apos;t talk to you . you don &apos;t listen .
that &apos;s not true .
i &apos;m a witch .
and don &apos;t we all know it ?
see ? that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
i &apos;m trying to tell you something . you don &apos;t even hear it .
i listen .
when do i not listen ?
jeremy totally ditched me .
where &apos;d he go ?
home . it &apos;s not far . he can walk it .
so are you ... are you from here ?
are you a townie ?
i &apos;m a returnee .
left town for a while . now i &apos;m back .
why &apos;d you leave ?
school .
and then there &apos;s the real reason .
i was wronged .
guy named logan .
what &apos;d he do ?
basics ...
lied , cheated ,
lured me back in , left me again .
your turn . any sad relationship stories ?
the basics ...
fell in love , married young ,
my wife died .
yeah. that &apos;s always a good conversation stopper .
what happened ?
well , you , me , and the , uh ,
north carolina police department
are all wondering the same thing .
it &apos;s , uh ... it &apos;s what &apos;s known as a cold case .
so why &apos;d you move here ?
oh , a change of pace ,
new scenery .
i like it here . it &apos;s ...
got a rich history .
lucky shot .
more like a carefully honed skill over many decades .
you &apos;re beating me .
well , yeah .
it &apos;s because i &apos;m better than you .
i &apos;m onto you . reverse psychology ?
i mean , it &apos;s a little transparent ,
but i admire the effort .
you prefer the brooding forehead ?
seriously , what game do you think you &apos;re playing ?
that &apos;s a funny question considering the fact
that i have been asking you that for months .
it &apos;s frustrating , isn &apos;t it ?
touche .
bonnie .
look , it &apos;s just not me , ok ?
i don &apos;t believe in the ...
whoo whoo .
but if you do , then ok . i &apos;m in .
that &apos;s all it takes for me to jump on board ,
because i consider you to be my best friend .
and i &apos;m saying this knowing that elena &apos;s
in the kitchen listening to my every word .
look , i didn &apos;t know how real this was for you ,
but i &apos;m listening now .
ok ?
elena , you can come in now . we &apos;re done .
well , there is just way too much drama in this room .
so what do you guys wanna do ?
i have an idea .
why don &apos;t we have a seance
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
come on . let &apos;s summon some spirits .
this emily chick has some serious explaining to do .
what are we doing ?
i don &apos;t know .
be quiet and concentrate .
ok , close your eyes .
ok , now take a deep breath .
bonnie , call to her .
emily ...
you there ?
really ? &quot; emily , you there ? &quot;
that &apos;s all you got ?
come on .
fine . jeez .
emily ...
i call on you .
i know you have a message .
i &apos;m here to listen .
did that just ...
yeah . that just happened .
it &apos;s just the air conditioning .
ask her to show you a sign . ask her .
emily , if you &apos;re among us ,
show us another sign .
see ? it &apos;s not working .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m done .
get the light .
please get the light .
hold on . hold on . i got it .
you guys ,
the necklace , it &apos;s gone .
what are we doing in here ?
bonding . catch .
go on .
give it a try .
don &apos;t forget who taught you how to play this game .
ow . that hurts .
downside of my diet .
getting hit actually hurts .
i &apos;m impressed , stefan .
fun with booze and darts ,
sentimental with football ,
and now starry night .
what do you want , stefan ?
wasn &apos;t real , damon .
our love for katherine .
oh , god .
she compelled us . we didn &apos;t have a choice .
took me years to sort that out ,
to truly understand what she did to us .
oh , no , stefan .
we are not take in that on tonight .
what do you want with katherine &apos;s crystal ?
how do you know about that ?
come on . you knew elena would tell me .
how did you know it was katherine &apos;s ?
emily gave it to her on her last night .
i was with her . you weren &apos;t .
i was the last one to see her , damon .
now , what do you want with katherine &apos;s crystal ?
she didn &apos;t tell you ?
we had other things on our mind .
i could rip your heart out and not think twice about it .
yeah . i &apos;ve heard that before .
i have a bigger surprise , stefan .
i &apos;m gonna bring her back .
ok , fun &apos;s over , caroline .
you made a point , and i get it .
now give it back .
what ?
well , i didn &apos;t take it .
what ? what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . nothing .
jeremy , are you home ?
guys ...
oh , my god !
open the door !
bonnie !
help me !
what &apos;s going on ?
bonnie ! bonnie !
bonnie , try the other door .
i &apos;ll check the hallway .
bonnie ! bonnie ! unlock the door !
get me out !
help me !
bonnie !
help !
help me !
bonnie ! open the ...
open the door !
what happened ? are you ok ?
i &apos;m fine .
unbelievable .
you were totally faking it .
caroline , come on .
no , you scared the hell out of me .
bonnie ?
i &apos;m fine .
everything &apos;s fine .
how can you bring katherine back ?
before katherine and the others were killed in the church ,
you remember what it was like in this town ?
yeah , i remember the fear and the hysteria .
the townspeople were killing vampires one by one .
when they came for katherine , i went straight to emily ,
said , &quot; i &apos;ll do anything. name your price . &quot;
&quot; just protect her . &quot;
she did .
how ?
she did some kind of spell with the crystal .
and while the church was burning ,
we thought katherine was burning in it .
she wasn &apos;t .
but i ... i saw her go inside .
there &apos;s a tomb underneath the church .
the spell sealed katherine in that tomb , protecting her .
are you telling me that katherine &apos;s alive ?
well , if that &apos;s what you wanna call it .
she &apos;s been trapped in a mystical holding cell
for the last century and a half .
but you &apos;re an expert on a starving vampire ,
so how do you think she &apos;s doin &apos; , stef ?
did you know that witches can use celestial events
to draw energy into their magic ?
pfft . me either .
but in order to give the crystal its power ,
emily used the comet that was passing overhead ,
and in order for that crystal to work again ...
the comet had to return .
downside ... long time in between comets
and a couple of hiccups along the way with the crystal ,
but the comet passed , and i got the crystal .
and then caroline got the crystal ,
and now bonnie has the crystal ,
and here we are .
why would emily ...
why would she do this for you ?
because she kwew they were gonna come for her , too ,
and she made me promise that her lineage would survive .
i remember . you ... you saved her children .
yeah . it &apos;s the only thing keeping me
from ripping that little bonnie girl &apos;s
throat out to get my crystal back .
oh , well . deal &apos;s a deal .
so ...
you wanna go throw some more ?
i can &apos;t believe i fell for it .
are you ok ?
i must go .
she &apos;s leaving , i &apos;m leaving .
you guys can &apos;t leave .
oh , i can .
i &apos;ve had enough
freaky fake witch stuff for one night .
thank you for having me .
i &apos;ll take it from here .
where are you going ?
back to where it all began .
bonnie .
bonnie .
oh , my god .
emily !
i won &apos;t let him have it .
it must be destroyed .
wait !
what &apos;s happening ?
i don &apos;t know . the door , it &apos;s not ...
what the hell ?
i &apos;m outta here .
what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s bonnie .
what happened ?
emily is possessing her .
she said something .
what did she say ?
she said , &quot; i won &apos;t let him have it . &quot;
&quot; it must be destroyed , &quot;
and then she just left .
ok . where do you think she went ?
i don &apos;t know .
fell &apos;s church ,
that &apos;s where she took bonnie in her dreams .
we have to help her , stefan .
all right . all right . just stay there .
i &apos;m gonna go and find her .
hello , emily .
you look different .
i won &apos;t let you do it .
we had a deal .
things are different now .
i need to protect my family .
i protected your family .
you owe me .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re about to be a lot more than that .
you &apos;re so wrong . i &apos;m much more pathetic .
oh , no , no , no . i &apos;ve got you beat .
i have pathetic down to a science .
uh , no . we haven &apos;t even covered high school .
braces ,
&quot; a &quot; cup .
ah , glasses , skin condition .
you can , uh ...
you know what ? i &apos;m not gonna invite you in .
jeremy .
well , some other time then .
have a good night , jenna .
so , uh , you found the boxes .
yeah , i found this , too .
me and logan .
that &apos;s just cruel .
no , cruel is dating my history teacher .
i &apos;m not dating him .
yet .
this is why i feed on people .
stefan .
hello , emily .
these people don &apos;t deserve this .
they should never have to know such evil .
what do you mean evil ?
emily , i swear to god i &apos;ll make you regret this .
i won &apos;t let you unleash them into this world .
them ?
what part of the story did you lelee out , damon ?
what does it matter ?
emily , tell me what you did .
to save her ,
i had to save them .
you saved everyone in the church ?
with one comes all .
i don &apos;t care about that . i just want katherine .
i knew i shouldn &apos;t have believed a single
word that comes out of your mouth .
this isn &apos;t about love , is it ?
this is about revenge .
the two aren &apos;t mutually exclusive .
damon , you can &apos;t do this .
why not ? they killed 27 people ,
and they called it a war battle .
they deserve whatever they get .
27 vampires , damon .
they were vampires .
you can &apos;t just bring them back .
this town deserves this .
you &apos;re blaming innocent people for something
that happened 145 years ago .
there is nothing innocent about these people ,
and don &apos;t think for a second it won &apos;t happen again .
they already know too much ,
and they &apos;ll burn your little grandwitch
right next to us when they find out . trust me .
things are different now .
don &apos;t do this .
i can &apos;t free them .
i won &apos;t .
incendia !
no !
no. no .
no , please .
bonnie !
no !
she &apos;s alive , but barely . i can save her .
her neck ,
it &apos;s healing .
god .
what are you doing here ?
uh , your window was open . i thought you should know .
not funny .
look , earlier today , i lied .
about ?
about being in bed with you .
we cuddled , and it creeped me out .
it creeped you out ?
i mean , did you just come over here to insult me or what ?
because it &apos;s been a really long night .
no , it &apos;s just that i ... i don &apos;t like you .
i never have , but ...
it was nice .
what ?
being in bed with you , it felt nice .
and so , i was thinking about it ,
and i thought that i should tell you
i stayed the night because you were all sad and alone
and i felt bad for you .
well , thank you ,
&apos;cause i love being a charity case .
you can leave now .
no , because i know ...
with vicki gone and my mom off with pete whoever ,
it &apos;s just me , so ...
i know .
katherine never compelled me .
i knew everything every step of the way .
it was real for me .
i &apos;ll leave now .
i don &apos;t understand , elena , what happened to me .
he attacked me , and ...
his face was like ...
how do you feel ? are you ok ?
i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s just this blood . i don &apos;t ...
i &apos;m not gonna hurt you .
what &apos;s going on , elena ?
i &apos;ll explain everything , bonnie , ok ?
let &apos;s just get out of here .
bonnie . bonnie , look at me .
trust me .
he &apos;s not going to hurt you .
come on .
come on .
shh . get in .
is she in danger of becoming ...
no . no , she has to die with my blood in her system ,
so keep an eye on her tight
and make sure that nothing happens ,
and once it leaves her system , she &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;m gonna tell her the truth .
you sure ?
i can trust her .
i need someone to know , someone to talk to .
i can &apos;t live in secret .
i know .
shouldn &apos;t have to .
you saved her life .
