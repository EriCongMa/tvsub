the only thing stronger than your craving for blood
is your love for this one girl .
your humanity is killing you .
turn it off .
what did you do ?
i fixed him .
fight for it . feel something ,
anything , stefan .
&apos;cause if you don &apos;t , you &apos;re going to lose me forever .
klaus killed your mother .
he has a hold on you , on me , on everyone .
he has for 1,000 years . we have to make it stop !
they &apos;re looking for mikael--
the vampire who hunts vampires .
you don &apos;t want to wake him . he will kill all of you .
i thought you might know how to kill klaus .
i can kill klaus . and i will .
as long as klaus is alive , i do what he says .
mikael .
get klaus back to mystic falls .
and i will gladly drive a stake through his heart .
fail--i &apos;ll drive it through yours .
portland is fantastic
once you can get over all the whitney music
and healthy @-@ looking people .
it &apos;s literally a breeding ground for werewolves .
your father &apos;s dead .
what did you say to me ?
oh , my mistake .
not your actual father , and not dead .
mikael .
daggered .
what do you want me to do with the body ?
well , first , i want you to explain to me
exactly what happened .
all right , we &apos;ll say that mikael followed elena in here .
he tried to grab her so he could use her as bait .
and you , what , vervained him ?
no , we vervained him .
the guy &apos;s an original . make it realistic .
ok . fine . we vervained him
and in the process discovered that he had a dagger
which he planned to use on rebekah .
but instead--
we drove it through his heart .
and what happens when he asks to see mikael &apos;s body ?
good point .
you , my brother , have been compelled to do what klaus says .
so if the idea is to lure him back here and kill him ,
the last thing we need is you getting tripped up and tongue tied .
well don &apos;t look at me .
i &apos;m just in charge of getting him back here .
klaus is smart .
if we tell him that mikael &apos;s dead , he &apos;ll want proof .
then i shall be dead .
what if he wants to see in person ?
well , it means our plan is working .
klaus will absolutely want to see my body .
you lure him here , and i will kill him .
with what ? those daggers won &apos;t work on him .
well , i &apos;m in possession of a stake
fashioned from the wood of the ancient white oak tree .
the one that left these ashes when it burned .
where is it ?
not here .
knowing its location is my insurance policy .
against what ?
you leaving this in my heart .
you see , a vampire can &apos;t dagger an original without dying .
so ... it falls to you .
you want me to actually dagger you ?
klaus will leave nothing to chance ,
especially when it comes to trust .
i want to see him .
i want to see his rotting body for myself .
well , he &apos;s here .
come by whenever .
if you &apos;re lying to me , stefan ,
your compulsion will expose you .
so answer with your life ,
is what you &apos;re saying the truth ?
it &apos;s true . i saw it with my own eyes .
i want to talk to rebekah .
that &apos;s not a problem . she &apos;s right here .
hello , nik .
rebekah , love .
what &apos;s this i hear about mikael &apos;s tragic run @-@ in with a dagger ?
it &apos;s true .
he &apos;s finally out of our lives for good .
i miss you . i &apos;m miserable here .
i &apos;ll be home soon .
good .
i &apos;ll see you then , brother .
he bought it . he &apos;s coming home .
now was that easy or what ?
let &apos;s just get this over with .
finally .
took you long enough .
rebekah ...
whatever fatherly rubbish you &apos;re thinking , save it .
nothing you say matters to me .
i see .
where &apos;s my dagger ?
elena has it .
so you can forget your plans to use it on me .
you were never the one i was after .
nik was my family .
if you were after him , you were after me .
he blinded you , rebekah . he killed your mother .
i know what he did . and he &apos;ll pay for it with his life .
but nik was not born a killer . none of us were .
you did this to us when you turned us into vampires .
you destroyed our family .
not him .
rebekah ...
i hate everything in my closet .
i have nothing to wear to homecoming .
so don &apos;t go . let &apos;s stay home , order take @-@ out
and over @-@ analyze ancient hieroglyphic thingies with alaric .
we have to go . caroline will kill us .
oh , caroline actually has a date .
you know that you can talk to me about jeremy , right ?
i don &apos;t need to talk about it .
he fell in love with his ghost girlfriend and lied about it .
what &apos;s done is done .
you have to talk about it . he hurt you , bonnie .
i &apos;m mad at him too .
you &apos;re mad at your little brother .
you &apos;ll yell at him a little , teach him a life lesson .
you can &apos;t really be mad like i &apos;m mad .
bonnie--
and you shouldn &apos;t have to be . he &apos;s your brother .
so no , i can &apos;t really talk to you about it .
we can &apos;t trust rebekah not to turn on us .
oh , really ?
because those original vampires are usually so reliable .
bonnie was right .
rebekah may be mad at klaus now ,
but he is her brother .
her lying , mama @-@ killing , dagger @-@ happy brother .
the wolfsbane &apos;s ready .
there are too many things that can go wrong with this plan .
too many people who can make it go wrong .
well , i am formulating a secret contingency plan .
really ? what is it ?
well , if i told you , then it won &apos;t be a secret .
i need to borrow a tie .
you have your own ties .
i &apos;m 162 years old and i &apos;m going to a homecoming dance .
i need better ties .
you could not go .
i &apos;m compelled to protect you .
and if i look at your track record at high school dances ,
it &apos;s pretty tragic .
my luck you &apos;ll go ahead
and get yourself murdered by the homecoming queen .
i know how to do it . alaric taught me .
elena , if this thing blows up in our face
just remember only one of us heals quickly .
ugh , please tell me that you have a better plan
than wolfsbane grenades .
never you mind , brother .
the less you know , the better .
my freedom from klaus
rests entirely upon you two executing your plan perfectly .
so , excuse me if i &apos;m a bit cynical .
you &apos;re the one that we should be worried about .
if klaus asks you one wrong question ,
whole thing falls apart .
you do have reason to worry .
but if i look back at our history of epic plan failures ,
it &apos;s usually because one of us
let our humanity get in the way .
so if i &apos;m taking odds on how this thing goes down ,
it &apos;s certainly not gonna be me who screws it up .
i &apos;ll see you at homecoming . i can &apos;t wait .
hey , can you hand me the glitter gun ?
thanks .
hey , can &apos;t we ditch the decorating and go grab a bite ?
oh , i have a thermos in my bag .
i mean a real bite .
rebekah knows some people who like to be fed on .
they &apos;re into it . we don &apos;t even have to compel them .
ok , first of all ,
i finally almost just got your mother to stop hating me .
so i probably don &apos;t want to get caught in
some weird vampire threesome with her son .
and secondly , quit hanging out with eebekah ,
the evil blood slut .
just keep the claws in tonight at the dance , ok ?
for me ?
so who has the misfortune of being compelled to be her date ?
matt said he &apos;d take her .
wait , you set her up with matt ?
she wants to go to the dance ,
and he didn &apos;t have anyone to go with .
he drinks vervain , she can &apos;t feed on him .
what &apos;s the big deal ?
the big deal , tyler ,
is that matt is an innocent , good person
who should not be going to dances with evil blood sluts .
matt &apos;s a guy , caroline .
and rebekah &apos;s hot . don &apos;t overthink this .
this is a sire thing , isn &apos;t it ?
please tell me this is some weird family extension
of your sire bond to klaus .
i &apos;m here hanging streamers and have glitter all over my hands .
if i &apos;m sired to anybody , it &apos;s you .
getting a head start , huh ?
embarrassing truth .
this is my first high school dance .
ever ?
i never really had time for high school before .
nik and i were always moving around .
running .
anyway , i didn &apos;t want to leave anything to chance .
have you heard any more from him ?
no .
but i &apos;m sure that when he does return ,
he &apos;ll do it with flair .
and damon and my father are all set with their plan ?
yes .
don &apos;t tell me . i don &apos;t want to know .
i just want to go to the dance
and leave the rest to mikael .
i know it &apos;s really hard .
so thank you for helping us get klaus back into town .
just be careful .
i &apos;ve been running for 1,000 years for a reason .
mikael is not a good person .
and he definitely can &apos;t be trusted .
no one in my family can .
are you ok ?
i &apos;ve spent my whole life
loving and hating my brother with equal measure .
i never thought that i would be the one
to help drive a stake through his heart .
no tears . i--
i don &apos;t want to ruin my makeup .
how do i look ?
amazing .
but you &apos;re missing one thing .
my mother &apos;s necklace .
you should wear it tonight .
may i ?
thank you .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i can &apos;t leave anything to chance either .
in the back . harsh .
it had to be done .
rebekah was never going to be completely on our side .
hey , i &apos;m not judging you .
it &apos;s very katherine of you .
not the way to make me feel better about myself , damon .
it was a compliment ... sort of .
stefan is right .
someone &apos;s going to let their humanity get in the way
and screw this whole thing up .
and it &apos;s probably going to be me .
elena , you just daggered somebody .
you &apos;re going to be fine .
yeah . but i feel bad about it .
i care too much .
that &apos;s the problem , damon .
i &apos;m the weak link .
if it makes you feel any better , she &apos;s not really dead .
do you trust him ? mikael ?
nope .
what about stefan ?
no .
not as long as he &apos;s under klaus &apos;s control .
then we need a better plan .
i know what to do .
you &apos;re just not going to like it .
why not ?
because when this all goes down ,
i don &apos;t want you having any part of it .
what does that mean ?
do you trust me ?
yes .
then you have nothing to worry about .
what happened ?
the gym &apos;s flooded .
the dance is cancelled .
excuse me ?
well , what are we supposed to do now ? !
so does that mean i don &apos;t have go ?
you wish .
no , tyler &apos;s moving the party to his house .
kegs and beer pong for homecoming ?
that &apos;s ... different .
just say you &apos;re still coming .
i &apos;ll see you there .
elena .
matt , hey .
um , slight problem with your homecoming date .
what happened ?
how would you feel about a back @-@ up date ?
how did he plan a better party than me so fast ?
is that a band outside ?
who are all these people ?
this is weird . where is tyler ?
hey , stefan . what &apos;s up ?
hey , tyler . nice party you got going on here .
thanks , but i &apos;m not the one throwing it .
i &apos;m just doing what klaus wants .
what do you mean ?
it &apos;s not a party , man . it &apos;s a wake .
good evening everyone !
i want to thank you all for being here with me to celebrate .
it &apos;s been a long time coming .
so much for homecoming .
this is weird .
us being here together .
there &apos;s caroline . she doesn &apos;t know anything .
act normal .
hey , klaus is here .
what ?
yeah , apparently our sired hybrid friend tyler
thought it &apos;d be ok to let his &quot; master &quot; throw a party .
well , i expected more surprise .
i &apos;ve learned not to be surprised by anything klaus does .
i &apos;m going to go find bonnie .
what &apos;s going on ?
and what are you two doing here together ?
i thought you were supposed to be with rebekah .
plans changed . i need a drink .
quite the homecoming .
i &apos;ve been planning my father &apos;s funeral for 1,000 years .
granted , in no version of it
were any of these people invited .
but you get the idea .
so now what ? you just stop running ?
now i reunite my family .
your family .
you mean , the people you cart around in caskets ?
none of that matters anymore .
mikael &apos;s gone . bygones will be bygones .
really great party . i like the band .
seems the homecoming queen still walks among the living ,
which leaves me to believe rebekah isn &apos;t here .
where is she ?
i have no idea . i thought she was coming with matt .
oh , be honest now , stefan .
where &apos;s my sister ?
i said i have no idea .
now , would you like me to take you to your father ?
well , it wouldn &apos;t be a party without the guest of honor , would it ?
bring him to me .
all right .
perhaps there &apos;s something in it for me ?
my freedom from your compulsion .
oh , you want your freedom ?
well , once he &apos;s dead
and his weapon destroyed ,
you &apos;ll have your freedom .
it &apos;ll be my pleasure to give it back to you .
did my daughter go to the dance ?
yep . you missed the photo op .
did you get the stake ?
i did .
i &apos;m not going take your word for it .
no offense to your honor and all .
none taken .
fancy .
may i ?
it &apos;s the only weapon on this earth that can kill an original .
so i think i &apos;ll hold on to it . no offense .
i &apos;d offer you a drink ,
but katherine tells me
you &apos;re more of a vampire on the rocks kinda guy .
well , technically , you could still offer .
why feed on vampires ?
don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s for the smooth aftertaste .
i had a hand in creating vampires .
but the blood lust was never my intention .
over the centuries , i learned to feed from the predator ,
not the innocent .
change in plans .
klaus is back . he &apos;s at the lockwoods .
and he wants your body delivered to his doorstep .
i &apos;m afraid he &apos;s in for a colossal disappointment .
well , he &apos;s certainly not going to come here .
i hope your plan didn &apos;t depend on that .
didn &apos;t depend on that .
but you do have a plan . right ?
oh , yeah . we got a plan , right ?
it just doesn &apos;t involve you .
you couldn &apos;t just break his neck ?
it certainly occurred to me .
my mom would seriously freak
if she saw all these people here .
your mother won &apos;t be a problem .
i compelled her to go to church and pray for your friends .
what are you talking about ?
i want you to look around .
there &apos;s bonnie .
there &apos;s elena and matt .
there &apos;s your pretty little girlfriend caroline .
their big dance was wrecked tonight
and who came through with a party ?
you did . what a pal .
but who are all these other people here ?
i have no idea .
i &apos;ve never seen half these people in my life .
well , that &apos;s because i invited a few dozen friends of my own .
that &apos;s my friend mindy .
i picked her up along the way in kansas .
did you know that there &apos;s an
entire bloodline of werewolves in the heartland ?
there &apos;s tony , from north dakota ,
and let &apos;s not forget the seattle contingent .
hold on . are those people all hybrids ?
well , they also love a good party .
and they , like you , are sired by me .
they wish to serve their master .
so if anyone should so much as make a move against me ,
they may feel obligated to retaliate .
feel free to warn your friends .
what are you up to with klaus ?
nothing .
he &apos;s on to you , caroline .
whatever you all think you &apos;re about to pull off ,
he &apos;s two steps ahead of you .
ok , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you &apos;re lying to me .
you know actually i am not .
i don &apos;t know anything . and even if i did ,
i wouldn &apos;t tell you about ,
because you &apos;re sired to team klaus now .
and you can &apos;t be trusted .
so can we please just go back to the party ?
where &apos;s your date ?
getting me a drink .
well ...
seems i have you to thank for mikael &apos;s demise .
he came at me . i didn &apos;t have a choice .
still i &apos;m impressed .
it &apos;s not easy for a human to dagger an original .
it wasn &apos;t the first time .
right . elijah .
you seem nervous .
i &apos;m not nervous . i just don &apos;t like you .
well , straight to the point then , shall i , love ?
people have been after me for 1,000 years .
and i am always one step ahead .
so whatever it is you &apos;re thinking of trying ,
go for it , give it your best shot .
you won &apos;t succeed .
invite @-@ only , vampire .
here &apos;s my rsvp .
hybrid .
what did you do to her ?
it &apos;s just vervain .
she &apos;ll be fine .
but i need you to get her out of here as fast as possible .
what &apos;s going on ?
something &apos;s going down against klaus ,
and this house is full of hybrids like me
that can &apos;t let anything happen to him .
what do you mean , &quot; can &apos;t &quot; ?
i can &apos;t explain it .
i can &apos;t fight against it .
i just know that i need to protect him
no matter who gets in my way .
by attacking caroline ?
i &apos;m protecting her , matt !
this is the only way to keep her safe .
please . just get her out of here safely .
get everyone out .
as the host , you should know
those hybrids don &apos;t make the best first impression .
whatever move you &apos;re making , klaus is going to be ready for you .
he &apos;ll kill anyone at this party if he has to .
tell someone who cares .
bonnie .
ugh ! what the hell is wrong with you ?
you &apos;re not supposed to witchy migraine me .
you weren &apos;t supposed to kill tyler .
he tried to bite me .
what is that ?
nothing .
oh my god . is that the--
why do you have it ?
because i &apos;m the only one who could get inside the house .
you have a visitor .
well , tell my visitor i &apos;m on the brink of victory here .
he said his name is mikael .
then we mustn &apos;t keep him waiting .
move everyone out back .
i &apos;m going to have a little chat with my dad .
tony , you know what to do .
hello , niklaus .
hello , mikael . won &apos;t you come in ?
oh , that &apos;s right . i forgot . you can &apos;t .
or you can come outside if you want .
or i can watch my hybrids tear you limb from limb .
they can &apos;t kill me .
true , but it &apos;ll make a hell of a party game .
all i have to do is rub these two fingers together ,
and they &apos;ll pounce .
the big bad wolf .
you haven &apos;t changed .
still hiding behind your playthings like a coward .
you only forget .
they may be sired by you ,
but they &apos;re still part vampire .
and they can be compelled by me .
come out and face me , niklaus ,
or she dies .
go ahead . kill her .
no , klaus . he &apos;ll do it .
if she dies ,
this lot will be the last of your abominations .
i don &apos;t need them .
i just need to be rid of you .
to what end , niklaus ?
so you can live forever with no one at your side ?
nobody cares about you anymore , boy !
who do you have other than those
whose loyalty you &apos;ve forced ?
no one .
no one .
i &apos;m calling your bluff , father .
kill her .
come outside and face me ,
you little coward .
and i won &apos;t have to .
my whole life you &apos;ve underestimated me .
if you kill her , you lose your leverage .
so go ahead . go on . kill her .
come on , old man . kill her .
kill her !
your impulse , niklaus .
it has and will forever be
the one thing
that keeps you from truly being great .
katherine ...
kaboom .
what are you doing ? !
what the hell did you do ?
he &apos;s earned his freedom .
thank you , my friend .
you no longer have to do as i say .
you &apos;re free .
are you ok ?
what do you think ?
i &apos;m sorry i stabbed you .
it was the only thing i could think of to get you out of there .
oh yeah ? ! not : &quot; oh , hey , caroline ,
&quot; i &apos;m worried about what might happen this evening .
&quot; so maybe you should just
&quot; go home and watch &apos; dancing with the stars ? &apos; &quot;
if you knew all your friends were going to get together
and try to take down klaus ,
would you have left ?
no .
so there you go . i saved you from your own stubbornness .
this isn &apos;t funny , tyler !
how am i supposed to be with you
when you &apos;re sired to him ?
i need you to understand , caroline .
understand what ?
that you &apos;re one of the bad guys now ?
understand that this is who i am .
there &apos;s nothing that i can do about it .
klaus can &apos;t be killed .
i can &apos;t be fixed .
understand that i &apos;m ok with it .
but how are you ok with it ?
because it &apos;s better .
i don &apos;t have to turn , caroline .
not unless i want to .
i never have to go through that pain again .
if being sired to klaus is the price that i have to pay ,
so be it .
but you don &apos;t have any true control over yourself .
i never did before .
the full moon controlled me .
after everything that we &apos;ve been through
you &apos;ve been there for me through all of it .
don &apos;t turn your back on me now .
tyler ...
right .
i just ...
got it .
how did this happen ?
we thought of everything , elena !
klaus having hybrids .
mikael turning on us .
we brought in katherine so you weren &apos;t in danger .
anything that could have gone wrong ,
we were prepared .
i don &apos;t understand .
stefan wanted klaus dead more than anything .
that &apos;s what we were counting on .
we blew it .
where &apos;s katherine ?
she ran for the hills , like usual .
the minute things got bad . who blames her ?
klaus would have crushed her .
i had him , elena .
i had klaus .
this could &apos;ve all be over !
damon , hey--
hey , listen to me , we &apos;ll survive this .
we always survive .
trust me .
we &apos;re never getting stefan back .
you know that , don &apos;t you ?
then we &apos;ll let him go . ok ?
we &apos;ll have to let him go .
not interested in the play by play
of our failure right now , katherine .
i &apos;m just calling to say goodbye .
i don &apos;t know what to tell you .
you had a good plan , damon .
and that &apos;s high praise coming from me .
it &apos;s not very comforting at the moment .
you going back into hiding ?
at least my life &apos;s not boring .
goodbye , damon .
take care of yourself , katherine .
he doesn &apos;t know where it all wrong .
he doesn &apos;t need to know .
are you good from here ?
i need to put about a million miles
between myself and klaus as soon as possible .
stefan ...
stefan .
elena .
not exactly .
pep up . i only got a minute
before they realize that i &apos;m not at the party .
you seem nervous .
i &apos;m not nervous . i just don &apos;t like you .
people have been after me for 1,000 years .
and i am always one step ahead .
so whatever it is you &apos;re thinking of trying ,
go for it , give it your best shot .
you won &apos;t succeed .
it won &apos;t be for lack of trying .
now you &apos;d be smart to tell damon
to mind his manners tonight .
&apos;cause if i die , i &apos;ve already insured
that he &apos;ll die along with me .
even in death , my hybrids have their orders .
so you kill me , you &apos;re killing him too .
how did you know that i would stop damon ?
i didn &apos;t .
i was just hoping that you would want to .
if klaus gets killed , he &apos;s taking damon down with him .
so pull the plug on the plan .
and face the wrath of mikael ? we &apos;ll all be dead .
ok , look . i know that you &apos;ve turned off your humanity
and that you don &apos;t care .
so there &apos;s only one solution .
and what &apos;s that ?
care , stefan .
care enough to save damon &apos;s life .
because i &apos;m going back to that party
and i &apos;m seeing this plan through .
klaus will be killed and we &apos;ll have our freedom .
but then damon will be dead .
your brother will be dead , stefan .
unless you care enough to do something about it .
you &apos;ve wanted klaus dead for 500 years .
why would you risk all that just to save damon &apos;s life ?
i wasn &apos;t just trying to save damon &apos;s life , stefan .
i was trying to save yours .
your humanity .
let &apos;s just say i like the old you better .
come on , katherine , you don &apos;t care about anyone but yourself .
you never have .
you and i both know that that is not true .
i loved you .
i loved damon too .
humanity is a vampire &apos;s greatest weakness .
no matter how easy it is to turn it off ,
it just keeps trying to fight its way back in .
sometimes i let it .
i can &apos;t let it all back in .
i don &apos;t want to .
not after everything i &apos;ve done .
of course you don &apos;t want to .
but if you don &apos;t let yourself feel ,
you won &apos;t be able to do what i need you to do next .
what &apos;s that ?
get mad .
rebekah , where are you ?
pick up the phone , darling . daddy &apos;s dead .
it &apos;s time for a family reunion .
stefan . miss me already ?
i &apos;m just calling to thank you for my freedom .
i like to believe i &apos;m a man of my word . more or less .
the thing is , it came at too high of a price .
you took everything from me , klaus .
let bygones be bygones .
trust me , resentment gets old .
you know what never gets old ?
revenge .
no !
what &apos;s the matter , klaus ?
missing something ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m just enjoying my freedom .
i will kill you and every one you &apos;ve ever met .
you do that and you &apos;ll never see your family again .
i wonder , klaus .
as someone who &apos;s been one step ahead for 1,000 years .
