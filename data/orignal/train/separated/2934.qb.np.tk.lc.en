yeah , but i was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird ..
like mine is now !
yes , but haven &apos;t you wanted a kid , like , forever ?
yeah , but no one ever wanted to have one with me . i mean ..
now i &apos;m just gonna have a baby if i want to . oh , what are you doing to me ?

julie &apos;s cervix is dilated seven centimeters . that &apos;s about four fingers !
doctor let me feel it myself .
have you felt rachel &apos;s cervix , ross ?
no , i don &apos;t .. we &apos;re not gonna do that .
we won &apos;t be doing that .
well , if you like , you could feel rachel &apos;s , then feel mine to compare .

oh , i &apos;m sorry .

that &apos;s all right . i &apos;m coming back later with your father .
i needed to talk to you before the birth .
okay . what &apos;s up ?
ross , i want to talk to you as your mother ..
even though i know that you and i are also very close friends .
i really don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , but okay .
i brought something that i want to give you .
assuming , of course , that you want it .
ma , you &apos;re asking me to marry you ?
this is your grandmother &apos;s engagement ring , i want you to give it to rachel .
mom , no . come on . thank you .
just hear me out ..
no ! okay ? we &apos;ve been through this .
we &apos;re not gonna get married just because she &apos;s pregnant . okay ?
honestly , ross , this isn &apos;t just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped .
you think young people use that word more than we actually do .
ross , a child should have a family .
you know what ? i can &apos;t deal with this right now . i &apos;m sorry .
go .. hey , go talk to monica .
she got a new haircut . you &apos;ll hate it .
just think about it . if you don &apos;t , i &apos;ll talk more about humping .
give me .
hi , dear .
hi . thank you so much for coming .
ross , get in here !
you wanna see something funny ?
monica .
okay . all right , stop it . you &apos;re freaking me out .
do it again . do it again .
hey , rachel had the baby .
what ?
really ?
no .
i don &apos;t know why i thought that &apos;d be funny .
you said hi to mom before she left , right ?
i thought that was her .
yeah , i called her name , and she ducked into a stairwell .
well , you know what ? consider yourself lucky .
she pulled me out of the labor room to ask me why i &apos;m not with rachel .
oh , my god .
how annoying .
yeah .
why aren &apos;t you with rachel ?
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
look , we &apos;re not gonna be together just because we &apos;re having this baby .
and i know she &apos;s not just some girl i humped ..
oh , humped ?
come on , ross .
but it just seems that you two belong together .
okay , stop it . i can &apos;t deal with this right now . i have to go have a baby .
right . and with who again ?
he &apos;s crazy . why doesn &apos;t he wanna be with rachel ?
i know .
seriously , she &apos;s like the perfect woman . i mean , i know she turned me down ..
but if she hadn &apos;t and she wanted to be with me ..
i would take her in my arms and ..
i haven &apos;t bummed you guys out like this in a while , have i ?
hey .
hey .
who &apos;s that ?
new people .
what happened to the disgustingtons ?
they &apos;re having their baby . it &apos;s not fair , ross . i got here first !
right after you left , they wheeled her off into delivery .
oh , but not before she gave me a nice , juicy shot of little jamie crowning away .
wow . sorry .
so how are the new people ?
well , they have some unusual pet names for each other .
including &quot; evil bitch &quot; and &quot; sick bastard . &quot;
oh , gosh , a contraction .
yeah ? okay , okay . just breathe .
are you looking at her ?
no !
don &apos;t you look at her , you sick bastard !
honey , i swear i wasn &apos;t looking at her !
she &apos;s in labor . you like that , you sick son of a bitch ?
i &apos;m just gonna ..
see ? it &apos;s because you were looking , you fat pervert .
no , no . i &apos;m sure no one was looking . just want some privacy .
you miss your girlfriend ?
just ignore them .
you okay ?
yeah .
ross .
what ?
he &apos;s looking at me .
hey !
you wanna live to see your baby ?
don &apos;t you talk to my husband like that , you stupid bastard !
oh , good god ! if you want a baby so bad , just go steal it !
oh , don &apos;t worry . these babies are far too ugly for us .
what is going on with you . since when are you so crazy about babies ?
i &apos;m not crazy about babies . i &apos;m crazy about us .
what ?
we &apos;ve always talked about having babies someday , not now ..
but i &apos;m starting to think that we can handle it . we &apos;re good .
we &apos;re really good .
we are pretty good .
but nothing has to happen until you &apos;re ready .
well , maybe i &apos;m ready now .
i mean , it &apos;s a little scary , but maybe it &apos;s right .
what ? it &apos;s not right ! we &apos;re not ready to have a kid now !
what ?
i &apos;m kidding . this is gonna be fun .
so we &apos;re gonna try ? i mean , we &apos;re trying ?
we &apos;re trying to get pregnant .
i &apos;m not comfortable doing this in front of the babies .
so when do you want to start trying ?
all right , hold on a sec .
period math ?
yeah .
well , we could start trying now .
right here ?
no , not here .
maybe here .
it &apos;s perfect . we got a lot of time to kill , and we &apos;re in a building that &apos;s full of beds !
and it &apos;s so clean !
come on , you stupid machine ! come on !
it ate your money ?
no .
i &apos;ll see you downstairs then .
all right .
hey , i got one ! i got one !
hi .

oh . down , please .
i hate to be a ball @-@ buster , but can i just do it ?
could you press up too ?
sure .
i feel bad . i broke my leg once too .
yeah ? how &apos;d yours happen ?
well , it &apos;s a long story , it &apos;s kind of embarrassing .
let &apos;s just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual .
how about you ?
car accident .
some idiot on a cell phone wasn &apos;t paying attention ?
yeah . me .
sorry .
oh , no . no , don &apos;t be .
nobody else got hurt . and i was pretty lucky .
well , i , for one , am glad you made it .
are you sure ? i mean , you don &apos;t know me .
i could have been sent from another planet to destroy earth .
couldn &apos;t press the &quot; down &quot; button . i think earth &apos;s okay .
oh , hey , that &apos;s me .
hey , i take it you &apos;re just visiting someone .
well , if you have some time and you wanna visit someone else ..
yeah , i would like that .
great . i &apos;m in room ..
wait ! what ? no ! elevator ! no !
you gotta press the button .
the nurse said they &apos;re bringing in another woman .
oh . is she pregnant yet ?
she doesn &apos;t need to be . she &apos;ll still have the baby before i do .
oh , ross ! another contraction .
oh , okay . here , here .
that &apos;s it .
oh , that sounded like a bad one .
yeah , it was .
mine haven &apos;t been so bad . oh , here comes one now .
oh , that was a big one .
that was , like , the biggest one yet . are you okay , honey ?
i &apos;m okay , honey .
well , i got some bad news . it gets worse .
and when you get to the end , they get really big ..
and they come , like , every minute .
well , mine are pretty close together . i think ..
excuse me .
yeah , that &apos;s quite all right .
oh , by the way , my name &apos;s johanna . what &apos;s yours ?
excuse me , could you help me with something ?
i &apos;m looking for a man .
well , who isn &apos;t ?
you . you aren &apos;t .
good for you .
anyway , the patient i &apos;m looking for has a broken leg .
he &apos;s in a wheelchair . he &apos;s early to mid @-@ 30s , very attractive .
even you would think so .
i know who you &apos;re talking about .
great ! what room number is he in ?
i &apos;m sorry . patient information is confidential .
no , i &apos;m not gonna bother him . we were talking earlier ..
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m sorry . that information is restricted to hospital staff .
she &apos;s with me . dr. drake ramoray .
dr. drake who ?
ramoray . it &apos;s portuguese . we need that information . i &apos;m a doctor .
a doctor at this hospital ?
damn it , we &apos;re losing precious time .
you want this man &apos;s blood on your head .. ?
hands .
hands !
it is absolutely essential that you tell me what room he is staying in .
he &apos;s a patient of mine . i &apos;ve treated him for years .
he &apos;s in room 816 .
816 . thank you .
and what is his name ?
no .
i think we found a place .
okay .
wait . wanna set the mood a little ?
hello , monica .
not like that .
oh , okay .
we &apos;ll dim the lights .
okay .
or turn them out altogether .
no scented candles . okay , here . there we go .
okay , okay . making me sterile , but okay .
okay . i &apos;m sorry . oh , wait . do we have a condom ?
oh , right !
yes , 98.6 . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
this is it !
that &apos;s him !
great . go get him !
wait a second . or maybe you could go in first .
he &apos;s not really my type .
not you . dr. ramoray . ask him questions and see what he &apos;s like .
people tell doctors everything .
you said he was this great guy .
all the guys i meet seem nice at first , then turn out to be big jerks .
you do attract some stinkers .
yeah , i know .
dr. long , i &apos;ve been at this for 17 hours .
three women have come and gone with their babies .
you gotta give me good news . how many centimeters am i dilated ? eight ? nine ?
three .
just three ?
i &apos;m dilated three !
we are moving along just slowly . don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re doing great .
i &apos;ll be back soon .
thank you .
you know what ? i &apos;m not waiting . i &apos;m gonna push this baby out .
i &apos;m doing it . three centimeters . that &apos;s gotta be like this , right ?
actually , it &apos;s more like this .
oh , stupid metric system .
we &apos;re gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room .
oh , for the love of god !
it &apos;s coming ! it &apos;s coming !
and here it is !
oh , come on !
i &apos;m dr. drake ramoray . i have a few routine questions i need to ask you .
really ? i &apos;ve been dealing with dr. wells .
i know . i &apos;m a neurologist . just to be on the safe side ..
dr. wells wanted a more comprehensive overview . so he sent me .
dr. wells is a woman !
that was a test . good response .
all right . full name ?
clifford burnett .
date of birth ?
november 16,1968 .
age ?
can &apos;t you figure that out ?
i &apos;m a doctor , not a mathematician .
i &apos;m 33 .
okay .
and are you married ?
no .
oh , really ? so 33 and single ? would you say you have commitment issues ?
are all the questions this personal ?
yes .
well , if you must know , i &apos;m a widower .
oh , that &apos;s terrible . i &apos;m really sorry .
yeah .
i lost my wife five years ago to a mild cardial infarction .
a heart attack , doctor .
oh , yeah . well , yeah , mild car ..
are you experiencing any dizziness ?
no .
has the pain been getting worse ?
no .
do you sleep with women and never call them again ?
no .
excellent . excellent .
and finally , are you into any weird stuff , you know , sexually ?
no !
wrong answer .
this room &apos;s available .
okay ! wait , you listen to me !
since i have been waiting , four women ..
that &apos;s four , one higher than the number of centimeters i &apos;m dilated ..
have come and gone with their babies . i &apos;m next . it &apos;s my turn . it &apos;s only fair .
if you bring in one more woman who has her baby before me , i will sue you .
not this hospital . i &apos;m gonna sue you . my husband is a lawyer .
rach ?
you get back on that case , honey !
i don &apos;t think the next patient is very far along .
okay . well , then bring her in .
oh , my god !
i can &apos;t believe this !
and yet , somehow , it &apos;s true .
i mean , this is so great . we &apos;re gonna be baby buddies !
squeeze your legs together and cover the baby &apos;s ears .
hi , sweetie !
hi , sweetheart .
this is my husband , sid . i don &apos;t think you &apos;ve met him . ross , rachel , this is sid .
i nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist &apos;s office .
thank god for adult acne !
i still can &apos;t believe it . i &apos;m the luckiest guy in the world .
really ?
what &apos;d he say ?
you have to speak very loudly , he &apos;s almost completely deaf .
oh , there you go .
of course he is .
congratulations , you two . i didn &apos;t even know you got married .
oh , we didn &apos;t .
what ?
we &apos;re just having this baby together , but that &apos;s all , you know .
why ?
we &apos;re just not in that place , you know ? but we &apos;re very excited about this .
oh . well , then shut me up .
just tell me how .
oh , i feel another one coming .
sid , you lucky , deaf bastard .
what else ? what else ?
he &apos;s 33 .
a widower .
he seemed like a standup guy . and he &apos;s not into anything weird sexually .
enter phoebe !
should we tell rachel there &apos;s an empty private room right next door to hers ?
we could . or we could have sex in it .
well , let me think about that while i remove my pants !
okay , mister ! fertilize me !
does that sound like janice ?
if it &apos;s not , then there &apos;s two of them .
and that would mean it &apos;s the end of the world !
hey .
hey .
hi .
i can &apos;t believe this is taking so long . how you doing ?
not bad . you know that feeling , trying to blow a saint bernard out your ass ?
and soon someone will call her &quot; mom . &quot;
weirdest thing . did i hear .. ?
mother of god , it &apos;s true !
chandler bing !
janice .
not just janice . janice in labor . contracting and everything .
oh , this should be easy . i have a very wide pelvis .
you remember , chandler .
i feel so bad for you .
she &apos;s your ex . and i have richard .
janice , i didn &apos;t even know you were pregnant .
who &apos;s the unwitting human whose essence you &apos;ve stolen ?
it &apos;s you .
this is yours .
what ?
look how nervous he gets ! we haven &apos;t slept together in years !
that &apos;s funny . does it hurt ? does the labor hurt ?
okay , i &apos;ve got one for you . if you had to , which would you eat ?
a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla ?
i &apos;d have to say the talking gorilla .
because at least i could explain to him that you &apos;re making me eat him .
oh . somebody went to college .
yeah .
wow . what is it ? i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . my foot itches like crazy .
oh . i &apos;ll get it .
i usually get to know a girl better before i let her spoon me .
relax . it &apos;s not like we &apos;re forking .
when . when .
thank you . listen .
you seem to really know what to do with a utensil .
would you like to go to dinner sometime ?
yeah , i &apos;d really like that .
yeah ?
yeah . and i promise i won &apos;t make you eat any remarkable animals .
i was thinking ..
i &apos;d kind of like to make a move .
but , you know , with the leg .
oh , yeah .
maybe a little help .
okay .
let me fix your pillow .
cliff , you &apos;re so forward .
oh , it was really nice meeting you .
sid !
that &apos;s the first time i heard her voice .
i didn &apos;t care for it .
oh , that &apos;s five , ross . five women have had five babies ..
and i have had no babies .
why doesn &apos;t she want to come out ?
you know what i think it is ? i think you made such a nice home for her ..
over the last nine months that she just doesn &apos;t want to leave .
oh , look at you making up crap for me .
oh , god .
okay . okay .
twenty @-@ one hours . you &apos;re a hero .
doctor , you gotta do something ! get me drugs ..
or light a fire up in there and just smoke it out !
actually , i think you &apos;re ready to go to the delivery room .
what ?
ten centimeters . you &apos;re about to become a mom .
oh , my god . okay .
beat you , sucker ! oh , baby .
is this the same spoon that was in my cast ?
you know what ?
this one is .
oh , my god ! that &apos;s the doctor who was in my room before .
well , it must be one of those closed @-@ circuit hospital channels .
no , no . that &apos;s a soap opera .
this is a very dramatic hospital .
i &apos;m telling you , the guy from that show was here ..
asking me all these weird questions .
okay , mr. percocet .
i swear to you , that &apos;s the guy .
okay , cliff .
do you really believe that a character from a tv show was here in your room ?
what probably happened was you were watching this , you drifted off to sleep ..
and you dreamt he was here .
rachel &apos;s having her baby !
which is of no interest to me as a neurologist . i ..
that &apos;s him ! you know him ?
wake up , cliff !
what is going on ?
okay . okay . i .. okay .
i sent my friend , joey , in here to find out stuff about you .
if it .. you know , if it helps , you came off great .
a lot better than i &apos;m coming off right now .
i don &apos;t believe this . you got him to pretend he was a fake doctor ?
fake ? excuse me ? hello ?
you tried making me think i was crazy ?
that was wrong . i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s just that i liked you so much . can we just start over ?
i don &apos;t think so .
if i may ? you told me a lot of personal stuff about you , right ?
now , maybe it would help if you knew some personal stuff about her .
she was married to a gay ice dancer .
she gave birth to her brother &apos;s triplets .
her twin sister used to do porn .
we &apos;re trying to dial down the crazy .
right .
we don &apos;t really know each other , so it &apos;d be easy to forget about this ..
but there &apos;s something between us . i don &apos;t know about you ..
but that doesn &apos;t happen to me a lot .
it doesn &apos;t happen to me either .
me neither !
the baby ! rachel !
right , right !
oh , i love this scene .
okay , look . i gotta go too .
but .. what do you say ? can we just have that dinner ?
the triplets .
you and your brother didn &apos;t .. ?
no ! no , they implanted embryos .
then dinner sounds great .
great ! okay .
all right , then i &apos;ll see you later .
our friend &apos;s having a baby .
her own ?
oh , yeah . yeah .

i thought she had two heads .
oh , god !
is she gonna be okay ?
she &apos;s gonna be fine .
okay .
she &apos;s in a more difficult position , so you have to push harder now .
okay .
that &apos;s it . push . push .
you &apos;re gonna have to push even harder .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t ! i can &apos;t !
yes , you can . i know you can do this .

they &apos;re just wrapping her up .
okay . well , be careful with her , she &apos;s really tiny .
here she is .
oh , thanks for coming out of me .
i know . oh .
she &apos;s looking at me . hi . i know you .

that &apos;s fine . for now we &apos;ll just call her baby girl greene .
oh , no . baby girl geller @-@ greene .
hello , baby girl .

oh , come on in .
oh , there she is .
oh , she &apos;s so beautiful .

oh , my god . she &apos;s amazing .
oh , i &apos;m so glad you guys got drunk and had sex .
it &apos;s incredible . i mean , one minute she &apos;s inside you ..
and then 47 hours later , here she is .
she looks so real .
you know what i mean .
she &apos;s this whole tiny little person .
and she already has eyelashes and knees and ..
what ?
oh , no , no . it &apos;s okay .
for a second , i counted six fingers , but one was from the other hand . so we &apos;re good .
okay , my turn . my turn .
aunt phoebe .
oh , baby . oh , you &apos;re so cute !
oh , i could squeeze your little head .
i won &apos;t .
honey , what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing . i just can &apos;t stop crying .
the doctor said it &apos;s normal , with all the hormones , plus you &apos;re sleep @-@ deprived .
so . you guys are all sleep @-@ deprived .
i don &apos;t see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet .
oh , god .
what &apos;s the matter now ?
i was reliving it .
do you know what you &apos;re gonna call her yet ?
wait , it &apos;s not gonna be baby girl ? i thought that was so original .
actually , we &apos;ve narrowed it down to two names .
and you know what ? i love them both . so just pick one , and that &apos;ll be it .
wow , okay . everyone ..
this is lsabella .
hi , lsabella !
hi .
what ?
that &apos;s not her name .
i &apos;m sorry , she just doesn &apos;t feel like an lsabella .
so then i guess ferdinand is out .
what was the other one ?
delilah .
oh , great ! suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore .
so i guess we &apos;re back to baby girl .
what are we gonna do ?
it &apos;s okay . you &apos;ll find a name .
easy for you to say .
you already know what your kids &apos; names will be .
you do ?
i had them picked out since i was 14 .
oh , no , it &apos;s gonna be named after some snack or baked good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , tell us , what are they ?
okay . if it &apos;s a boy , it &apos;s daniel .
and if it &apos;s a girl ?
i don &apos;t wanna say .
oh , stop . tell us . we &apos;re not gonna want it .
okay . it &apos;s emma .
emma .
see , i don &apos;t want it .
do you have any other totally perfect names that you &apos;re not gonna use ?
take it .
what ?
she &apos;s clearly an emma .
oh , honey , but you love that name .
yeah , but i love you more .
besides , nothing goes with bing . so i &apos;m screwed .
hi , emma .
yep , that &apos;s you .
you &apos;re our little em .
what &apos;s that , honey ?
what ?
oh , you want a little cousin ?
you want a cousin right now ?
do i look like a giant sperm to all of you , or .. ?
that was amazing .
i know .
hey , do you realize that we may have just changed our lives forever ?
we may have started our family . in nine months we could be here ..
having our own baby .
and if not , we got to do it on a bucket .
i love you so much .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
you wanna do it again ?
this time just for us ?
probably .
aaron lipman @-@ guralnick would like to say hello to his future bride .
wow , he kind of takes your breath away , doesn &apos;t he ?
he &apos;s a keeper .
look at the little munchkin .
don &apos;t you worry . by the time you &apos;re old enough to date him ..
he &apos;s gonna have a different nose .
how you feeling ?
oh , i &apos;m fine .
i really admire what you &apos;re doing . just raising her all alone .
i &apos;m not doing it alone . i have ross .
sure . now . but what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married ?
well , then he gets a divorce . it &apos;s ross .
i &apos;m telling you , rachel , listen to janice .
they all say they &apos;re gonna be there , until they start their real family .
that &apos;s never gonna happen with ross .
that &apos;s what i thought .
i &apos;m lucky if my kid gets to spend a weekend with her father ..
and little miss new boobs .
really ?
i hate to be the one to say it ..
but , honey , you two are on your own .
well , that &apos;s .. you know , that &apos;s ..
we &apos;ve been alone for the last 20 minutes and we &apos;re doing okay .
maybe we won &apos;t be alone .
because lately things have been happening between me and ross .
and right before i went into labor , we had this kiss . you know ?
so it might be the beginning of something .
hey , janice .
oh , hi .
who &apos;s this little guy ?
aaron , your future son @-@ in @-@ law .
oh , no , no .
no .
i &apos;m gonna leave you three alone .
okay .
man , you see the kid on that nose ?
you know what i was thinking about ?
that kiss before we left the apartment . that was something , huh ?
yeah . yeah , it really was .
but we .. we gotta be careful .
we .. you know , we can &apos;t let that happen again , you know ?
right .
we don &apos;t want to go down that road .
no . that &apos;s why i brought it up .
they didn &apos;t have any sodas ?
oh , my god . i &apos;m sorry .
i was talking to this nurse . completely forgot .
and so it begins .
she in there ?
yeah . she &apos;s putting her down now . that &apos;s her .
isn &apos;t it amazing how every baby is beautiful ?
except that one .
what is this ? a petting zoo ?
look . look at emma .
i can &apos;t decide who she looks like , you or rachel .
oh , what , are you kidding ? she &apos;s gorgeous ! it &apos;s all rachel .
i &apos;m sorry . for the last time , why aren &apos;t you two together again ?
no , i know . because you &apos;re not in that place .
which would be fine , except you totally are .
it &apos;s complicated , okay ?
yeah , that &apos;s true .
you love her , you always have , you have a child together .
there &apos;s no right answer .
look , we &apos;ve been together . then apart . then together , then apart .
and now we have a baby .
it &apos;s just , if we got together again and it didn &apos;t work out ..
i could never do that to emma .
i mean , she came into this world thinking everything .. now me .
what , do they put something in the water here ?
it &apos;s just , rachel and l , we &apos;re doing really well now .
i know . if you try to make it more , you might wreck it .
yeah , exactly .
right .
or you might get everything you &apos;ve wanted since you were 15 .
hey .
i saw a woman breast @-@ feeding twins at the same time .
it is like a freak show up here .
what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing .
what is it ? hey .
really , it &apos;s nothing . i &apos;m ..
rach , come on . what ?
i &apos;ve just been thinking about how my baby and i are gonna be all alone .
what are you talking about ? what about ross ?
please . he &apos;ll be with his real family . the twins and little miss new boobs .
okay , how long was i watching that woman ?
i &apos;m just saying that , you know ..
someday ross is gonna meet somebody ..
and he &apos;s gonna have his own life .
right ?
yeah , i guess so .
i just never thought i &apos;d be raising this baby all by myself .
that &apos;s pretty dumb , huh ?
hey , you listen to me . listen to me .
you are never , ever gonna be alone .
okay ? i promise i won &apos;t let that happen .
joey . oh , sweetie , what would i do without you ?
you don &apos;t have to worry about that , okay ?
could you grab me my other box of tissues ?
they &apos;re under ross &apos; coat .
sure .
oh , my god !
joey ?
oh , my god .
