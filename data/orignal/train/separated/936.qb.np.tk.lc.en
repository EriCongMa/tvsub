tom moved out of the house .
tom and i are separating .
no .
after covering up a murder ,
gaby warned bree it was a bad time
to be dating a cop .
get rid of chuck . but you &apos;ve got to end this ,
and you &apos;ve got to end it now .
bree showed the mysterious letter to paul ,
who &apos;d seen one like it before .
i mentioned the letter to the police .
the main detective was a tall guy
with a short name like , uh , pence .
was it vance ? chuck vance ? that &apos;s it .
carlos struggled with remorse ...
i just want us to get back to normal .
we &apos;re never going back to normal !
and discovered he wasn &apos;t the only one feeling guilty .
it is nice to be able to talk about this .
you wanna get some coffee ?
susan delfino and carlos solis
had never been the best of friends .
susan thought carlos paid too much attention
to other people &apos;s opinions .
and carlos thought susan didn &apos;t pay attention at all .
over the years , they &apos;d never had much to say to one another .
but one night , susan found herself troubled by thoughts
she couldn &apos;t share with her spouse .
while two doors down ,
carlos was in the same predicament .
and that &apos;s how it came to pass
that two people who &apos;d never had much to say to one another
suddenly found ...
they had a great deal to talk about .
so i leave the office , walk into the parking garage ,
and ... there he is .
alejandro .
right in front of me .
i practically jump out of my skin .
then i turn around again .
it &apos;s just some guy getting into his car .
this is not me .
i can &apos;t sleep . i &apos;m seeing ghosts .
i feel like ...
i &apos;m walking around with a neon sign on my forehead ,
flashing &quot; guilty , guilty , &quot;
and everybody can see it .
sometimes i think i &apos;m losing it .
me , too .
i was getting ready to deck the guy .
can you imagine ?
can i imagine ?
i assaulted a cop , remember ?
oh , yeah . what happened with that ?
15 hours of community service .
and i can &apos;t tell mike .
it &apos;s one more thing i &apos;m lying to him about .
well , i can talk to gaby , but she &apos;s sick of listening .
that &apos;s what this makes this feel so ...
i know .
can i tell you something ?
when i went out walking tonight ,
i was kind of hoping i &apos;d run into you .
i was kinda hoping that , too .
you &apos;re kidding . you &apos;ve never read &quot; to kill a mockingbird &quot; ?
in my school , if you read a book ,
it was more like &quot; to kill a sophomore . &quot;
well , you would love it . um , it &apos;s about a guy
who tries to hang on to his sense of right and wrong
when the system fails him .
gee , i don &apos;t get that at all .
oh . your jacket . thank you .
yes , susan and carlos
were starting to pay attention to one another .
good night .
but what they didn &apos;t realize
was that someone else was paying attention , too .
wisteria lane may look flawless ,
but that &apos;s only because its residents
are so good at concealing imperfections .
they know how to make something old look new again ...
how to make an embarrassing mistake disappear ...
how to make a poor showing look like a modest victory ...
and how to make a friend feel better
after she &apos;s gone through a messy breakup .
gaby , how thoughtful .
it &apos;s from that new place , skinny berry .
tastes like a milkshake but only 18 calories .
and i figured you could use a little pick @-@ me @-@ up
after you dumped chuck .
yeah , well , about that ...
morning , women .
morning .
oh , is that-- is that from skinny berry ?
you know , the fraud unit &apos;s all over that place , right ?
apparently those things are like pure ice cream .
huh ! guess you can &apos;t trust anybody .
have a good day .
all right , i know what you &apos;re gonna say--
three words-- first word , &quot; you &apos;re , &quot;
third word , &quot; crazy , &quot;
middle word--what you keep doing to that guy !
you don &apos;t understand .
damn right i don &apos;t .
you said you were gonna dump him .
i was .
but ... i think chuck wrote the letter .
the &quot; i know what you did &quot; letter ?
what makes you think that ?
i spoke to paul young , and--
whoa , whoa . why would you talk to paul ?
to find out who else knew about mary alice &apos;s letter ,
and he said that when he confessed to killing martha huber ,
chuck was there .
okay , but why would chuck blackmail you ?
he &apos;s already got the milk and the cow .
no offense . just what else could he want ?
maybe he wants to control me .
maybe he wants money . i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;ve gotta start snooping .
what ?
yeah . go through his stuff ,
hack into his e @-@ mails , listen in on his phone calls .
i can &apos;t do that .
you have to , bree .
until we know what chuck knows-- exactly what he knows ,
it &apos;s not just you who &apos;s in danger .
it &apos;s all of us .
how &apos;s that pressure ?
ohh , perfect , and remember , friedrich ,
i &apos;ve hidden your tip somewhere on my body .
it &apos;s up to you to find it .
go away !
renee ! i need you .
lee ?
i am in crisis . i am at my wit &apos;s--
well , hello .
lee mcdermott . nice to meet you .
i &apos;m friedrich .
ooh , like in &quot; the sound of music &quot; ?
nothing ? okay . he plays for your team .
anyway , i need a huge favor .
i don &apos;t do favors . you know that .
it &apos;s for jenny .
oh , your daughter ?
yeah . no .
oh , please .
i am desperate .
when bob and i adopted her ,
we agreed that i would take care of the &quot; time of the month &quot; talk ,
and bob would handle all things bra .
well , that bastard is in tokyo ,
and the boobie fairy has arrived .
the boobie fairy ?
see why i should not be the one handling this ?
i was hoping ... maybe you could take her shopping ?
oh , man up . it &apos;s just a bra .
they terrify me .
too many numbers and letters and colors ,
and it &apos;s my little girl growing up ,
and i can &apos;t deal .
ohh , yes .
so you &apos;ll do it ?
no , he just found his tip .
renee !
fine . i &apos;ll take her , but only for an hour ,
and no small talk .
oh , bless you .
i will never forget you for this . mwah .
look ! ricky martin ! eating a banana !
just checking .
oh , please come with us . you &apos;ve bra shopped with penny .
and maybe one of your older boys , if i &apos;m guessing right .
i can &apos;t . i have plans .
oh , that &apos;s right . tom &apos;s got the kids ,
and you have this whole place to yourself .
what are you gonna do ?
oh , sweetie .
some man who &apos;s not married to you
is gonna have to see that body soon . do not do this .
it &apos;s not for me . my sister &apos;s coming .
lydia ? the disaster ?
yeah . out of the blue , she called
and says she wants to visit . you know what that means .
she got dumped .
after loaning him a lot of money .
and finding out he &apos;s married .
in two states . so ... i gotta get the whole toolkit ready
so after she crash @-@ lands here , i can pick up the pieces .
uh , i &apos;m going out the back door .
i hate to see people crying .
it reminds me how little i actually care about others .
coming !
oh , hi .
lynnie . ohh .
you look ...
you look fantastic .
you thought i &apos;d be my usual blubbery mess
of snot and tears , didn &apos;t you ?
what ? no .
well , that &apos;s not me anymore .
thanks to rashi , i &apos;m a changed woman .
rashi ? oh , god . did you get a dog ?
no , silly . i got engaged
to the greatest guy in the world .
oh , and , lynette , i &apos;m so sorry about you and tom .
but don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m here to help .
hey . sorry i &apos;m late .
grocery store was a madhouse .
i actually had to fight a woman over the last chicken .
susan--
unfortunately , she was slavic--
a very sturdy people , so i hope you like cereal .
susan , stop . i just got off the phone
with the guy from the county .
something about your court @-@ ordered community service
for assaulting a policeman .
oh . that .
yeah , that .
w--it &apos;s so ridiculous .
i was ... trying to fight a ... parking ticket ,
and i knocked over the cop &apos;s bike .
um , and i maybe told him his baby was ugly .
he--he blew the whole thing out of proportion .
well , you know what i &apos;m blowing out of proportion ?
the guy on the phone called me &quot; mr. solis . &quot;
right .
because , um ...
carlos picked me up at the , uh , police station ,
which i know sounds weird--
why him and not you ...
i was just , uh , so embarrassed ,
i @-@ i didn &apos;t wanna tell you .
so there &apos;s nothing going on with you and carlos ?
i shouldn &apos;t be worried
about your little moonlight stroll last night ?
have you been taking fighting lessons
from that slavic lady ?
mike , come on .
i couldn &apos;t sleep . carlos couldn &apos;t sleep .
we ran into each other , and we talked .
about what ? you barely know him .
the first eight years we lived here ,
you called him ricky ricardo .
he &apos;s ... going through something ,
and i &apos;m helping him .
yeah ? tell me . what &apos;s he going through ?
it &apos;s personal .
okay , mike , carlos and i are just friends .
i don &apos;t mind you being friends with a guy .
it &apos;s all the sneaking around and the lying
i &apos;m having a hard time with .
so she waltzes in to my advanced yoga class
even though , clearly , she &apos;s never done yoga before .
well , the teacher of the beginner &apos;s class
wasn &apos;t nearly as cute as you .
and then i , uh , go over
and correct her cobbler pose , right ?
and our eyes meet .
and three weeks later , he gives me this .
wow , that &apos;s some rock .
literally , it &apos;s a rock .
i saw it on the beach after class .
it calls out to me ,
and i feel like i might need it someday .
and you did . isn &apos;t the universe amazing ?
amazingly thrifty .
okay .
so this is my third glass .
i &apos;m saying mean things , but i &apos;m not getting a buzz .
the wine is alcohol @-@ free .
so this night &apos;s not getting any better .
ever since rashi did a liver cleanse on me ,
i haven &apos;t had a drop to drink .
you got lydia to give up wine ?
you should take your act to vegas .
it &apos;s not an act .
i &apos;m gonna go grab some spices out of the van .
okay , who are you kidding ?
you can &apos;t marry that sunflower seed .
i &apos;m not kidding anybody .
i love him .
in fact , he &apos;s leading a meditation seminar ...
at kerrigan park .
why don &apos;t you come ?
it might help you deal with your marriage crashing .
my marriage did not crash .
tom and i are separated .
exactly why you should be
doing some &quot; lynette work . &quot;
come on . it &apos;ll be fun .
six hours of silence in a traditional mountain yurt .
i promise you , lydia ,
if you drag me to a yurt ,
two will go in , one will come out .
careful . that &apos;s our tax dollars you &apos;re dripping .
sorry .
you need to pace yourself . you &apos;re gonna need lots of paint
to cover that gigantic banana over there .
uh ... i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a banana .
hey , i worked hard on that graffiti .
what are you doing here ?
&quot; to kill a mockingbird . &quot;
i started reading it last night .
it was so good .
i couldn &apos;t wait to talk to you about it .
yeah , well , i &apos;m kinda beautifying the city
at the moment .
don &apos;t you get a lunch ?
look , carlos , mike found out we were spending time together ,
and he &apos;s a little weird about it ,
so i don &apos;t think we should be having any intimate lunches .
why is he weird ? i mean , nothing &apos;s going on .
no , of course not , but somehow ...
us meeting in the middle of the night
and me lying about it was
kind of a red flag for him .
okay .
well , if lunch is too intimate ...
how about ... i help with the beautifying ?
i guess there &apos;s no harm in that .
excuse me .
are you here for community service ?
nope , just trying to be a good citizen .
can &apos;t . not unless you committed a crime .
are you serious ?
yeah .
there .
i littered .
jenny , trust me .
you want jackson to notice you ,
ice him out .
don &apos;t talk to him . don &apos;t look at him .
maybe have sex with his best friend .
i mean , have a soda . got it ?
totes .
what happened to you guys ?
you were supposed to be back two hours ago .
uh , we went shopping . here &apos;s your credit card .
oh , and by the way , i upped your limit .
3 grand ? what are you , a nurse ?
so ... tell me all about your day .
o.m.g. i want to see everything you bought .
dad , you &apos;re like a million years
too old for &quot; o.m.g. &quot;
i &apos;m gonna try the makeup you got me .
wait . you got her makeup ?
she &apos;s 11 .
uh , she wears a bra now .
think she &apos;s ready for strawberry lip gloss .
tell me what happens with jackson .
i want all the deets .
&quot; deets . &quot; i love you .
well , look at you two , all b.f.f.
so who &apos;s this jackson ? i would like those deets .
oh , she asked me not to tell anyone about him .
i &apos;m not anyone . i &apos;m her co @-@ father .
well , don &apos;t take it personally .
there are just some things girls would rather talk about
with other girls .
i could be a girl .
i could totally be a girl !
well , you got the voice down .
hey , where are you ?
in the kitchen ! come join me .
smells amazing . what are you making ?
oh , seared tilapia , bearnaise sabayon ,
and a little bok choy .
mind giving me a hand ?
bree , the only word i recognized
in that sentence was &quot; hand . &quot;
come on . there &apos;s nothing to it . this is bearnaise sauce .
it just needs ten minutes of constant whisking .
constant .
look at you . you &apos;re a natural .
i &apos;m gonna go dress for dinner .
now remember , keep whisking for ten minutes .
if your hand starts to spasm , it means you &apos;re doing it right .
bree , i think it &apos;s been ten minutes !
no ! no , not even close !
keep whisking till it &apos;s light and frothy !
布里 · 范德坎普
okay , i don &apos;t care how long it &apos;s been ,
that stuff ain &apos;t getting any frothier .
and i got a cramp in my shooting hand .
so if a criminal gets away tomorrow , it &apos;ll be your fault .
i &apos;m so sorry .
here . let me , uh , massage it for you .
he took a picture of your hand while you were sleeping ?
how creepy is that ?
i know . why would he do such a thing ?
oh , my god .
what ?
he must have found a handprint at the crime scene .
he pulled your print off the photo ,
and they were a match .
is that possible ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , then what &apos;s in the envelope ?
maybe the cell phone or a piece of the shovel handle .
whatever it is , that &apos;s what he &apos;s gonna use to nail us .
well , we have to get that envelope ,
and i can &apos;t keep distracting him by having him stir sauces .
by the way , his bearnaise-- disaster .
okay . tonight when he gets home ,
you take him for a long walk ,
leave the back door open , and i &apos;ll do the rest .
got it .
what if the briefcase is locked ?
i can pick locks . yeah .
i can also disguise my voice , forge people &apos;s signatures ,
and i &apos;m a decent pickpocket .
adultery gave me some valuable life skills .
fractions are so stupid .
i &apos;m never gonna need this stuff anyway .
are you kidding me ?
let &apos;s say you marry a guy who &apos;s worth $ 20 million .
you divorce him , and he gives you half ,
but your prenup says you get three @-@ quarters .
that extra $ 5 million gets you a yacht ,
because you learned your fractions .
true story , by the way .
hello ? it &apos;s lee !
hey ! come on up .
you know , you &apos;d be a really cool mom .
you think so ?
no , i &apos;d probably just leave the kid in a nightclub
or ... morocco .
hey . what are you doing here ?
what am i doing here ? i &apos;m looking for my daughter ,
who said she &apos;d be home by 5 : 00 .
i guess we got carried away .
totes .
use the whole word ! how much time are you saving ?
calm down .
can you stay out of this ?
this is between me and my daughter .
stop . you &apos;re embarrassing me .
i don &apos;t care .
you need to come home with me ... now .
what if i say i &apos;m not ready to leave ?
what if i say you &apos;re grounded for a week ?
should we keep going ?
what ? ! you are so unfair !
aren &apos;t you being a little hard on her ?
back off , renee . you &apos;re not her mother .
mmm . my sweet , that was your most delicious meal yet .
what was in this ?
uh , just walnuts , hemp curds ,
and one very special ingredient .
please don &apos;t say &quot; love , &quot;
because i &apos;m already nauseous .
i find that a walk after a meal
helps encourage my digestive flow .
anybody care to join me ?
you go . i &apos;ll clean up .
no , lynette !
that &apos;s full of poison .
yes , delicious , creamy poison ,
which , by the way ,
you used to suck down by the gallon .
yes , i know , but i &apos;ve changed .
and i wanna help you change , too . it &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
wow . that &apos;s a bigger load of crap
than the one we just ate .
excuse me ?
you &apos;re not here for me . you &apos;re here because for once ,
you &apos;re the one in the happy relationship ,
and you just couldn &apos;t wait to rub my face in it .
how could--
why do you al--no .
no , no , no , no . no .
you won &apos;t drag me down to your level .
i am surrounded by a beautiful bubble
of loving energy .
yes , lydia ,
you are in a bubble ,
but once the pebble collector
dumps you like they all do ,
you &apos;ll go right back to being the ice cream @-@ binging ,
wine @-@ swilling ,
neurotic mess you really are .
pop !
you are so mean . god , i hate you .
there she is . welcome back .
my whole life , you &apos;ve treated me like a screwup .
you always had to be the happy one ,
the smart one , the married one .
well , guess what ? now you &apos;re the screwup , bitch .
you &apos;re alone and miserable ,
and i love it .
i love it , i love it , i love it , i love it !
wow .
i just , uh , forgot my ipod .
wow .
uh @-@ oh . a chardonnay float .
does that mean ...
yes .
rashi &apos;s gone to the retreat alone ,
so ... congratulations .
now i &apos;m just as miserable as you are .
did he ... dump you ?
he said now that he &apos;s seen the real me ,
he needs to meditate on whether or not he can still marry me .
i &apos;m so screwed , dude .
you know , if he was that quick to run off ,
maybe he &apos;s not the guy .
he &apos;s the guy .
i &apos;m just not the girl .
i thought i could put all that loser stuff behind me
and actually have a functional relationship .
i guess that &apos;s too much to ask for .
why don &apos;t you go talk to him ?
i can &apos;t .
after how i behaved ,
i &apos;ve been told my energy is no longer welcome in the yurt .
where is she ?
where is who ?
jenny . she &apos;s supposed to be grounded ,
but when i went to her room to check on her , she was gone .
well , she &apos;s not here . i &apos;ve been out all afternoon .
i don &apos;t think i trust you .
jenny ? are you in here ?
this is all your fault , you know .
my fault ? how is it my fault ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m not speaking to you right now .
we were a perfectly happy family
before you got involved .
got involved ? you made me take her shopping
&apos;cause you &apos;re scared of boobs !
yeah , and then you glommed on
because you don &apos;t have kids of your own .
it &apos;s not her fault !
jenny .
i snuck in a back window .
sorry .
what &apos;s going on ? why are you here ?
i like it here . we did our nails .
more .
i don &apos;t know .
sometimes i think it &apos;d be cool to have a ...
mother .
oh , my god . the &quot; m &quot; word .
easy .
what can a mother do that i can &apos;t ?
you wanna do your nails ?
mani @-@ pedi mondays start next week .
you want to try on shoes ?
i have the stilettos that cher wore
to the &quot; moonstruck &quot; premiere .
you can &apos;t go in the ladies &apos; room with me .
so that &apos;s the problem ? !
well , you &apos;ve got me .
i see why having a dad and a papa is so horrible .
jenny , why don &apos;t you go in the kitchen ?
the latest &quot; vogue &quot; is in there .
we have magazines at our house , too !
are you okay ?
this is my worst nightmare come true .
i &apos;ve worried about this moment
ever since she came into our lives .
what if bob and i aren &apos;t enough ?
what if she does need a mother ?
oh , shut up .
excuse me ?
you took a girl who was bouncing
from one foster home to another
and gave her two great parents who love her .
but you heard her . it &apos;s not enough .
oh , please , she &apos;s a kid .
today she wants a mom . tomorrow she &apos;ll want a car .
jenny is not lacking for anything ,
and you guys are doing an amazing job with her .
really ?
yeah , really .
so amazing , that for the first time in my life ,
i ... actually enjoyed hanging out with a kid .
aw . thank you .
and i take back everything i said
about you being an insensitive bitch .
uh , you never said that .
don &apos;t open your e @-@ mail .
we are the sun ,
the warmth radiating from our hearts .
we are the endless sea rolling beneath the forever sky .
we are the leaves . the wind blows us from trees .
sorry , sorry . stupid wind .
we are the stars ,
glowing , growing ,
losing ourselves but gaining the universe .
you got a sec ?
what are you doing here ?
besides trying not to laugh my ass off ?
i need to talk to you .
well , not now !
my students have been meditating for six hours .
they are very close to finding their bliss .
i &apos;m sure they can spare you for a few minutes ,
so come talk to me ,
or i will start singing ethel merman
at the top of my lungs .
there &apos;s no business like show business
there &apos;s no ...
so sorry .
i &apos;ll be right back .
come on .
you can &apos;t leave lydia .
i don &apos;t want to , but i didn &apos;t recognize
that person i saw yelling at you .
i did . it &apos;s the person i turn her into
every time we get together .
the lydia i didn &apos;t recognize was the one
who breezed through my house , happy and in love .
you don &apos;t understand . it &apos;s too hard for me
to be around people like you and lydia .
then ... eat a root or chant or whatever .
it &apos;s not gonna help , okay ?
why not ?
because you are exactly like my family .
my name is not rashi .
it &apos;s herbert brickmeyer ,
from levittown , long island ,
and that energy in your kitchen--
that was pure brickmeyer ,
and i can &apos;t be around that again .
okay . okay , first of all ,
lydia doesn &apos;t act like that when i &apos;m not pushing her buttons .
and even if she did , work it out .
that &apos;s what a relationship is .
and you &apos;re a relationship expert ?
i &apos;m an expert on screwing them up .
i &apos;m guessing it took you a while
to stop being a crazy long island brickmeyer ,
so give lydia a little time to find her bliss , too .
i &apos;ll think about it .
all this talk about my family &apos;s
got me really jonesing for a cigarette .
you wouldn &apos;t happen to ...
sorry , herb .
hi .
hi .
what ?
rashi called .
he had an epiphany during the retreat .
he knows i &apos;m changing , and he &apos;s willing to be patient .
he &apos;s right . you are changing .
i have never seen you like this before .
really ?
yeah , really , honey .
i think ...
i think that is why i have been so rotten to you .
i &apos;m jealous .
why ?
i don &apos;t get in relationships , lydia . i get on them .
i mount them and grab them by the hair
and kick them in the sides
until i make them go where i want .
and god help the other person
if they have a different idea than me .
is that what happened with you and tom ?
oh , yeah .
you can change , too , lynette .
i don &apos;t know if i can .
i &apos;m pretty sure this is as good as it gets .
no , lynette .
no , because you recognize your problem now .
and a wise man once said
that to begin the journey of change ,
we must pull on the boots of self @-@ awareness .
and was that wise man rashi ?
isn &apos;t he adorable ?
and when he talks to scout and jim ,
you know he doesn &apos;t wanna just do the right thing
for the community . he wants to do the right thing as a father .
i know . it &apos;s like when gregory peck
looks at those kids , you can tell that he &apos;s--
gregory peck ?
you didn &apos;t actually read the book , did you ?
yeah . i started , and then it was on cable .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just too many pages .
mike .
what ?
oh , god . he &apos;s turning around !
okay .
uh ... okay , come on .
do you think he saw us ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t see his truck . i think he left .
oh , thank god .
wow , that was close .
yeah , my heart &apos;s pounding .
i know . i can feel it .
what is going on here ?
nothing .
are you sure ?
yeah . we &apos;re just two friends
who are going through a tough time and are trying to
help each other through it , right ?
then why are we hiding in the back of a van
from my husband ?
i don &apos;t think we should do this anymore .
yeah .
mike ! what are you doing ?
when you &apos;re done helping your boyfriend ,
we need to talk .
you okay ?
yeah .
hello .
how was your day ?
it was a little stressful .
ah . mine , too .
we need to unwind . how about a nice , long walk ?
i have a better idea .
there &apos;s someplace special i &apos;d like to take you .
oh ? where ?
it &apos;s a surprise .
i don &apos;t really like surprises .
i do . shall we ?
now ?
uh , can i freshen up first ?
you look plenty fresh to me .
but i &apos;ve been in these clothes all day .
i &apos;d really like to change .
okay . don &apos;t keep me waiting .
bree , have you left yet ?
new plan . he &apos;s taking me out ,
and he &apos;s got the envelope .
where are you going ?
he won &apos;t say ,
but if he wrote that letter ,
and he &apos;s bringing me somewhere with the evidence ...
this is when he gives you the shakedown !
i &apos;ll follow you .
i thought you were gonna change .
i did .
my attitude . i didn &apos;t wanna go ,
but now i do .
uh , what about that-- that table in the corner ?
we &apos;d like some privacy .
no , no , no , no . i hate privacy .
i like noise and bustle and lots of people .
how about this one in the middle ?
whatever you say .
oh , aren &apos;t you warm in that jacket ?
actually , a little .
so , um , let &apos;s order first , and then we can talk .
don &apos;t these appetizers sound delicious ?
yum ! escargot , and i ...
i love onion soup .
but it &apos;ll be hard to pass up on the beef tartare .
rustic country pate . look .
uh , what am i looking at ?
it just says &quot; rustic country pate . &quot;
maybe we should look on the left side of the menu .
i definitely think we &apos;ll find something good on the left side .
we didn &apos;t get a wine list . where &apos;s our waiter ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
wait . where-- where are you going ?
to freshen up .
again ?
what do you think &apos;s in there ?
what if it &apos;s a bone ? you open it !
oh , no .
maybe it &apos;s a tooth ?
ohh . the picture of my hand--
he was trying to figure out my ring size .
well , this doesn &apos;t necessarily mean he didn &apos;t send the letter .
i think it does .
okay , well , this is a relief , right ?
i mean , at least he &apos;s not blackmailing you .
no , it means he wants to marry me .
so what are you gonna do ?
i like chuck , but he &apos;s not the man
i wanna spend the rest of my life with .
you can go . i &apos;ll do my best to let him down easy .
some rock , and on a cop &apos;s salary ?
but you should still dump him .
mike .
if you &apos;re gonna say it , say it fast .
there is no fast way to say it , buddy .
what the hell are you doing here ?
we &apos;re finally gonna tell you the truth .
about a month ago , the progressive dinner--
you remember that night ?
just get to the part that &apos;s the truth .
i killed gaby &apos;s stepfather .
and me and the girls helped cover it up .
i &apos;m sorry that took so long .
oh , that-- that--that &apos;s all right .
it actually gave me a chance
to have a scotch and a glass of red wine .
calm my nerves a little .
god , i wish i could have a drink .
why ? what are you nervous about ?
i have something important to say .
huh . um , i @-@ i wonder
if it &apos;s the same thing that i &apos;m gonna say .
i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s not .
chuck , you are a wonderful man ,
and i have enjoyed our time together , but--
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
are you--are you ...
you &apos;re dumping me ?
i was ...
i was about to propose to you .
i &apos;m sorry if i misled you--
hey , there &apos;s a fake apology . you did mislead me .
chuck , please--
you know , it &apos;s like you &apos;re two people .
there &apos;s the woman i have fun with ,
who i really ... i really connect to ,
and there &apos;s this other woman who &apos;s--
who &apos;s , uh , who &apos;s mysterious and--and weird
and keeps sneaking out to &quot; run errands . &quot;
there &apos;s another guy , isn &apos;t there ?
no . i assure you , there &apos;s no one else .
don &apos;t lie to me !
was he the one who sent you that letter ?
what letter ?
the one that you , uh , you were reading the other night ,
you got all shook up about--
was that from him ?
there is no &quot; him . &quot;
you know , bree ,
i would &apos;ve done anything for you .
i protect the people that i care about .
i don &apos;t care about you now .
so if you find yourself in trouble ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure that someday you will ...
then don &apos;t come calling me .
you have made a very big mistake .
yes , the residents of wisteria lane
are skilled at the art of concealment .
they know how to cover
the evidence of a messy breakup ...
to compensate for what their children might be missing ...
and to spare the feelings of a loved one
whose taste they may not share .
but for some ,
the art of concealment comes at too great a cost .
and so they find themselves forced to reveal the truth ...
