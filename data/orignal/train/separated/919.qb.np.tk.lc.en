back in the &apos; 80s , i was obsessed with space camp .
yep , nasa had an actual summer program
where you got to live like an astronaut .
hollywood even made a &quot; space camp &quot; movie
starring a young joaquin phoenix
and a goofy robot
which captured the heart of the entire nation .
no one is talking , dude .
well , it captured my heart .
wasn &apos;t that the most amazing movie you &apos;ve ever seen ?
eh , a bunch of kids
getting accidentally launched into space ?
that &apos;s asking a lot of the audience .
it wasn &apos;t an accident .
a small boy befriends a robot
who gets a nasa computer to launch them into orbit .
it &apos;s based on a true story .
yeah , you said the same thing
about &quot; mannequin &quot; - and &quot; weekend at bernie &apos;s . &quot;
fine ! i believe in the magic of movies !
doesn &apos;t change the fact
that i &apos;m gonna go - to the real space camp someday .
well , if i were you , i &apos;d go now , before it &apos;s too late .
what do you mean , too late ?
we &apos;re in high school next year , bro .
stuff like space camp doesn &apos;t exactly scream &quot; cool . &quot;
no ! you think ?
your dorkiness is becoming a tonnage issue ,
so , yeah , i &apos;d rein it in .
then it &apos;s settled !
this summer , i will live out my dream at space camp ,
and nothing &apos;s gonna stop me .
nothing except your dad , who will for sure stop you .
oh , he &apos;ll try , but i got the ultimate weapon --
showmanship .
you guys .
what the hell ? !
jim j. bullock was about to get sassy !
jimmy j. can wait !
i &apos;ve got an urgent presentation for you
that will for sure change your entire life .
will it ?
space -- the final frontier .
or is it ?
my name is adam frederick goldberg ,
and i have the right stuff .
big @-@ time !
damn you , earthling hero !
i would have taken your precious moon
if it wasn &apos;t for one thing !
space camp !
commander adam goldberg ,
you just saved the moon from an alien invasion .
how did you do it ?
i learned it at ...
space camp !
that &apos;s right -- space camp .
for the price of only 500 cups of coffee ,
you can help your youngest son reach for the stars .
it &apos;s me -- adam clayberg ,
and my dream is to go on a real spaceship .
look ! here &apos;s one now !
all aboard !
space camp !
i know you &apos;re a busy man ,
so i took the liberty of filling out the check .
of all the moron things my moron kids have ever asked for ,
this takes the cake .
dad , this is my dream !
you &apos;re literally - asking me for a spaceship .
don &apos;t twist my words !
i just want access to one .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot; - i &apos;m not sending you to space .
and you ! stop encouraging him !
i have to be honest --
i don &apos;t know what any of this is .
i just like spending time with the boy .
it was mother &apos;s day 1980 @-@ something ,
and my mother was awaiting her children &apos;s love
on her special day .
something &apos;s wrong . i don &apos;t smell breakfast .
except her children forgot .
it &apos;s me -- your mother .
ready to enjoy all the things that mothers get .
you know .
enough with the small talk . we need breakfast foods .
i &apos;m a growing boy .
i would love a nice fruit plate , but with no honeydew filler .
and don &apos;t let the pineapple touch the kiwi .
yeah , i like that . sounds good .
you should really be writing this down .
fortunately , our house had one suck @-@ up ...
me .
what &apos;s this ? you two finally dating ?
oh , boopie ! that &apos;s so sweet !
happy mother &apos;s day .
son of a bitch .
we are so boned .
what &apos;s wrong ?
d @-@ did you guys forget
and i &apos;m the only decent child in this family ?
shut your face @-@ mouth ! we have a gift .
it &apos;s a boat .
it &apos;s two boats .
it &apos;s not a boat , but it &apos;s way cooler and more expensive .
we just got to go wrap the awesome thing
that we bought you months and months ago .
we got to go to the toilet together .
you deserve better .
i really do .
there she is ,
doing the hardest job in the world !
bet you thought we forgot about your special day ,
but we were just messing with you .
gotcha , you clueless piece of crap !
happy mother &apos;s day !
oh , what do we have here ?
mom coupons .
yep . good for one free huggie .
mine &apos;s for a snuggle wuggle .
all righty . another great mother &apos;s day !
take care .
uh , you do know - the ink is still wet on these ?
but it &apos;s the thought that counts .
you didn &apos;t have the thought .
you didn &apos;t think about me at all .
and yet , it counts .
kind of seems like
a desperate , half @-@ assed empty gesture to me .
empty ?
you can totally cash those bad boys in any time you want .
great . i &apos;ll cash them in right now .
now &apos;s no good for me .
how about you save them for a special occasion ,
like ... next mother &apos;s day ?
or i can cash them all in today
and make this the greatest mother &apos;s day of my life .
what the -- you kept all those ?
oh , yes .
through the years , - you &apos;ve given me many coupons ,
and i &apos;ve been saving them all for a rainy day .
guess what .
storm &apos;s a @-@ comin &apos; .
oh , yes .
forget mother &apos;s day .
it was time for smother &apos;s day .
what ... have we ... done ?
as barry and erica entered their worst nightmare ,
i was still dreaming of space camp .
what is this we happened to stumble upon ?
it &apos;s the gyrotron 2000,
which simulates the tumble @-@ spin upon a rocket &apos;s re @-@ entry .
kiddo , weren &apos;t you just talking about space camp ?
what an amazing coincidence !
wait .
you said you needed sports shoes for the big athletic game .
and now that i hear myself say it , i &apos;m an idiot !
the real reason i brought you here was to witness my dream .
i told you -- no outer space camp .
it &apos;s just &quot; space camp &quot; !
and once you see the joy on my face ,
you won &apos;t be able to tell me &quot; no . &quot;
trust me -- your heart will melt .
oh , this isn &apos;t right !
we shouldn &apos;t be playing god !
that looks joyful .
my system ! my delicate system !
my delicate system ! !
sure , i ruined a pair of pants , but still had my passion .
if mom asks , my old pants were stolen . got it ?
okay , you gonna give up on all this space nonsense now ?
no ! come on . put yourself in my shoes .
think back to when you were a kid --
you know , pushing a hoop with a stick
on the way to the old fishin &apos; hole .
how old do you think i am ? !
point is , you were a child once , with hopes and dreams ,
just like me .
we &apos;re the same .
nope . never had any dreams .
every kid has dreams .
i didn &apos;t .
wait -- you &apos;ve always been like this ?
i thought life broke you down .
eh , even before that , i was like ... &quot; myeh . &quot;
can you believe him ?
look , don &apos;t be so hard on your dad .
it &apos;s how he was raised .
pop @-@ pop convinced him that dreams were stupid .
that &apos;s it !
i &apos;ll go ask pop @-@ pop !
he &apos;ll know if dad had any hopes and dreams .
wait . you actually want to go talk to that bitter old bastard ?
you &apos;re a braver man than i am .
for me , fear isn &apos;t an option .
excuse me , sir . you left this bag in the dressing room .
looks like your old pants ?
it &apos;s not mine ! it belongs to another small boy !
go , go , go ! go , go !
it &apos;s been a minute . we &apos;re done .
let me out of your grasp .
the coupon says &quot; spoonies with mama . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t specify a time limit .
&quot; one minute &quot; was implied !
well , you should have put that in the terms and restrictions .
i wrote that when i was 6 ! the world was still new !
well , why don &apos;t we change that attitude
with a &quot; full day of compliments &quot; ?
dear god , why ? !
oh , go on . just tell me everything you love about me .
your hair is yellow .
you &apos;re always picking stuff up .
and putting cheeses on meats and shrimps .
i don &apos;t know . erica , help me out here .
i &apos;ve got my own problems !
this is --
i can &apos;t --
this is my hell !
okay , i &apos;m finished . it &apos;s finally over .
not yet .
i &apos;m gonna get the pumice stone
and let you go to town on my rough areas .
i &apos;ve got a coupon good for whatever i want !
oh , no . why would you write that ? why ? !
i was 10 ! i wanted to go play !
i didn &apos;t know this day would come !
this is too much .
last night , we went to an italian restaurant ,
and she made me &quot; lady and the tramp &quot; a piece of spaghetti .
that &apos;s nothing .
this morning , i gave her a back massage .
her skin sucked up the lotion like a biscuit !
yesterday , i held hands with her for an hour
as we walked around the park .
we looked like a lesbian couple where she makes the money !
while i &apos;m having my heels shaved ,
why don &apos;t we hear about barry being a little teapot ?
i &apos;m not a little teapot ! i &apos;m a ripped one !
uh , we &apos;re done . mother &apos;s day is officially over .
sorry , boop . i &apos;ve still got a huge stack of coupons left .
doesn &apos;t matter , &apos; cause they all just expired .
we both know there &apos;s not a coupon in the world
i can &apos;t make the manager honor .
well , i am manager , and i reject your coupons .
why do you get to be manager ? this isn &apos;t fair .
there is no manager .
i demand co @-@ manager , or i walk !
whatever ! fine ! we &apos;re co @-@ managers !
and my first act as co @-@ manager will be this .
i see .
so , you &apos;re not just ruining this mother &apos;s day .
you &apos;re taking every other one away , too .
i &apos;m sorry , but we have no other choice .
message received .
i apologize in advance for what comes next .
uh , whatever this is , i don &apos;t want it or need it .
it &apos;s me -- your grandson .
i know .
the boy just wanted to know
which of murray &apos;s dreams you crushed when he was a child .
this could be fun . come on in .
and that is why you never trust a polynesian .
yeah , i think we &apos;re getting off @-@ topic .
remember , i came here about my dad &apos;s childhood dreams .
aw , that dummy never had any dreams .
are you sure ?
wait .
come to think of it , that dummy had a dummy .
there &apos;s the dummy &apos;s dummy .
what the --
dad wanted to be a ventriloquist ?
he loved this stupid wooden piece of crap .
luckily , i told him to stop being a jackass
and go out and get a job .
stupid 9 @-@ year @-@ old kid .
can i have this , pop @-@ pop ?
no way ! i use that in the carpool lane .
come on , ben . it &apos;d mean a lot to adam .
how much is a lot ? $ 200 ?
are you trying to shake down your own grandchild ?
he looks like he eats good .
it &apos;s a small price to pay
to give dad his dream so i can get mine .
fine . i &apos;ll take care of it .
that was a discount price for the kid .
for you , it &apos;s $ 300 .
well , that &apos;s fair .
let me just reach in my wallet , and --
go grab the doll and go .
go , go , go ! go , go , go !
you &apos;re lucky i was too cheap to have hip surgery ,
or i &apos;d be running after ya !
it was the morning
after barry and erica trashed their mother &apos;s day coupons .
my mom had yet to retaliate ...
until now .
what the --
what the --
my things !
your things ? ! what about my things ? !
mom , come quick ! we got robbed !
we need to get the fbi on this !
they took my hockey stick !
and -- and some things from under my mattress !
your things aren &apos;t stolen , schmoopers .
i just took them all back .
what are you saying right now ? !
you took away a lifetime of gifts from me .
it &apos;s only fair i do the same .
you can &apos;t do this !
i need my samurai sword and my california raisins
and my dancing cola friend !
they &apos;re what makes me me !
you mean this guy ?
he dances for me now .
shake it , cola man !
this is nuts .
who takes revenge for something horrible done to them ?
you know what ? keep our stuff !
i &apos;m not giving in to your crazy demands
of respect and decent treatment !
and i can live without my special dancing cola friend
no problem -- just you watch !
that day , erica and barry weren &apos;t the only ones
refusing to back down .
hey , dad . i have an amazing --
i &apos;m watching the channel guide to see what &apos;s on at 8 : 00 .
i already missed it once , and it &apos;s about to come &apos; round again .
this can &apos;t wait ! it &apos;s that important !
oh , damn it !
i missed it again !
this is the worst day of my life !
well , it &apos;s about to get a lot better .
i don &apos;t know what that is .
stop ! i know all about the dummy .
pop @-@ pop told me everything .
fine ! the dummy is mine . are you happy ?
i got that stupid thing when i was a kid .
but ... why does it look like you now ?
now ? that &apos;s how i looked .
admit it -- you had dreams ,
like every other kid in this world .
come on . put your hand in your old friend .
i will not put my hand in my friend .
do it ! feel your dream again !
why is this happening to me ? !
put your hand right on in there !
stop saying that !
murray , what &apos;s the big deal ?
jam your fist up your old pal .
it &apos;ll feel nice .
i see what this is .
you &apos;re trying to prove i had dreams
to let you go on your stupid space trip .
wha-- me ? how dare you , sir !
okay , everyone calm down .
tell you what -- i &apos;ll send him to space camp .
no way , al ! - you &apos;re not sending him anywhere .
understood .
i &apos;m sending you .
stop undermining me !
i &apos;m the father !
it &apos;s my job to keep his head
out of the clouds and down here on earth !
don &apos;t worry , buddy . i got your back .
no , you don &apos;t !
that , he hears .
i &apos;d struck out again ,
and while my mom had struck barry and erica &apos;s closets ,
they protested by getting creative .
morning . mama made pancakes .
for lainey , not you .
unfortunately , their protest didn &apos;t work .
um , you sure you guys don &apos;t want to go upstairs and change ?
you know , since you look like insane drifters ?
this is the look of freedom .
mom thinks she won by taking my stuff .
well , i made my own dress ,
like molly ringwald in &quot; pretty in pink . &quot;
only , instead of a cute pink dress , it &apos;s a trash bag .
so convenient .
we are supposed to be on the same team ! do better !
i don &apos;t get it . your mom &apos;s amazing .
her pancakes have these crispy edges .
it gets old real quick .
you &apos;re not here . you don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m actually around a lot .
i &apos;m literally here right now .
look , i know she can be intense ,
but if you guys want your stuff back ,
you got to step up in a big way .
and that meant one thing -- shedding their garbage clothes
and performing a lame , half @-@ assed love song .
mom , mom , she is the bomb
she puts the &quot; viet &quot; up in the &apos; nam
mom makes me sammies full of salam
&quot; mom &quot; spelled backwards , it still spell &quot; mom &quot;
other words like that are &quot; racecar &quot; and &quot; noon &quot;
we don &apos;t need our things back , but we &apos;d like &apos; em back soon
hit it !
mothers and daughters and mothers of daughters
mothers are mothers and mothers of daughters
blah , blah , blah . - it &apos;s a work in progress .
but what do you think ?
fine .
fine ? !
why aren &apos;t you attacking us with unwanted physical affection ?
yeah , and i reached into the depths of my soul
to write you that song .
you wrote that song for your father --
when you wanted to go on a ski trip .
i did not ...
know you knew about that .
unbelievable .
i give you my everything 364 days a year .
is it too much to ask
to have one day where you do something for me ?
and your lyrics are terrible .
as my mom gave up on smother &apos;s day ,
i was going full throttle to get me some space camp .
moron .
moron !
moron .
not you , lucky . you get cheese !
okay , i see what you &apos;re doing .
you &apos;re leaving maury around
so i &apos;ll fall back in love with him
and change my mind .
maury ?
yeah -- murray and maury .
you named him maury ?
we were a twin act . i was the funny one .
then embrace it .
i will not embrace it !
let your dream come alive in your hands !
these hands will be part of no dream .
just do it once . let me meet maury .
you want to meet maury ?
i want to meet maury !
fine !
meet maury .
hey , i &apos;m maury .
i &apos;m a colossal waste of time ,
just like a camp for spaceships ,
which is even dumber than me .
okay , you are incredibly gifted at that ,
but also incredibly wrong about space camp .
am i ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s stupid as
you &apos;re a master at your craft , but not cool !
sorry . i can &apos;t control what he says . you know how it is .
if that &apos;s how you want to play it , let &apos;s dance .
now he &apos;s a dancer , too .
does this kid have any hobbies that don &apos;t suck ?
hey , adam , is that putz your dad or a black cloud of despair ?
you &apos;re not doing it right ! i can see your mouth move .
just &apos; cause you &apos;re dead inside doesn &apos;t mean adam has to be !
when will you realize that life isn &apos;t all about
your &quot; space wars &quot; and your &quot; space trek &quot; ?
and it &apos;s &quot; star wars &quot; and &quot; star trek &quot; !
enough .
we &apos;re done talking about this . you &apos;re not going to space .
my god . do you even hear yourself ?
you &apos;re just as bad as pop @-@ pop .
he crushed all your dreams , and now you &apos;re crushing mine .
i am nothing like him .
have i ever left you hungry ?
did you ever have to walk home 5 miles in the rain from school ?
have you ever cried yourself to sleep
because you didn &apos;t know if i was coming home or not ?
dad , i didn &apos;t know that .
well , there &apos;s a lot you don &apos;t know .
my mom had given up on her perfect smother &apos;s day ,
but for barry and erica , it had just begun .
good morning , mamacita .
geez !
you can fold my socks later .
we got something special to show you .
guys , it &apos;s fine .
mother &apos;s day over . let &apos;s just move on .
actually , it &apos;s just getting started .
this is your real mother &apos;s day , and it starts with
the most delicious breakfast you &apos;ve ever --
holy hell !
things are burning !
oh , dear god ! what have we done ? !
look away ! we &apos;ll fix this !
panic is sweeping my body !
idiot ! what did you put in the dishwasher ? !
i don &apos;t know ! some kind of liquid soap !
in that moment ,
my mother saw through the smoke , foam , flames , and fighting
and truly saw her children loved her more than anything .
sure , our mother &apos;s day wasn &apos;t pretty , but it was us .
mom , we &apos;re so sorry .
yeah , we suck .
not only did we ruin your mother &apos;s day ,
but we ruined the attempt to make it up to you .
are you kidding me ?
this right here ?
it &apos;s everything .
but we destroyed your favorite place in the world -- the kitchen !
what ?
honestly , all i wanted was to know
you cared enough to try ,
and you did try --
so , so hard .
that , we did .
okay . this one &apos;s free .
no coupons necessary .
adam stole this from you .
i never understood why you spent your money on this stupid thing .
you know , i was just a kid .
no , you were a moron .
you &apos;re lucky i was around to set your straight .
you know , you could have been a lot nicer to me back then .
i was your dad . i was doing my job .
that day , murray goldberg learned
what it really meant to be a good father .
i did the best i could , you know ?
sure .
thanks to pop @-@ pop ,
my dad realized the best he could do
was give us the chance to soar for the skies .
and for me , that meant one thing .
plane ticket ?
wait . is this for space camp ? seriously ?
yeah , i don &apos;t get it , but i don &apos;t want to be the one
who stands in the way of your dreams .
hey , dad .
yeah ?
it was always hard for my father to say &quot; i love you . &quot;
but in the end , all that mattered was how he showed it .
and thanks to barry and erica &apos;s messy smother &apos;s day ,
my mom learned that their love for her
was as big as the universe .
and they connect right there to make the big dipper . see it ?
no .
we &apos;ll get there .
that &apos;s what it means to be a family .
sure , you occasionally act like a dummy ,
but in the end ,
you always help each other reach for the stars .
look ! it &apos;s the space shuttle !
yo ! want a ride ?
liftoff !
space camp !
that &apos;s the machine that defeated your pants ?
i will dominate it !
that thing is merciless , bar .
it &apos;s not worth it .
no , no . let him go .
it &apos;s gyro time .
stop it !
something &apos;s happening to my body !
i should not have had that milkshake !
here &apos;s 10 bucks to keep it going until he passes out .
i &apos;m unconscious !
i &apos;m completely unconscious !
