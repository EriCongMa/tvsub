back in the &apos; 80s , before you could buy anything you wanted
with a click of a mouse ,
shopping was more of a contact sport .
and no one was better at it than my mom .
remember , dented cans are 50 % off .
i made it easy for you . they &apos;re all dented .
now they &apos;re all dented .
i don &apos;t care if it is a misprint .
this ad says that
that lawn mower is $ 9.99,
and i am not leaving until you honor this price .
there was no bargain too small , too large ,
or too dangerous for beverly goldberg .
i &apos;m not exaggerating . this really happened .
mom , they &apos;re slipping !
don &apos;t you dare let go .
use the tag ! hold on tight !
it &apos;s ripping ! it says &quot; do not remove &quot; !
dad , slow down ! we can &apos;t hold them .
no . speed up . they &apos;ll stabilize at a higher speed .
this isn &apos;t worth it !
they were buy two , get two free .
it &apos;s totally worth it .
pumpkin .
big news about the winter formal .
found a great price on that dress you wanted .
is it behind this picture of a dress i don &apos;t want ?
seriously , i don &apos;t want some crappy knock off .
dad , little help ?
here &apos;s all i know about fashion .
i like blue . that &apos;s it .
then let me explain how it works .
you have to spend money to look nice .
or you could grab some of the old dresses in your closet ,
cut &apos; em up , and make a new one in the current style .
like , um , that movie with , uh , the girl with the face .
mom , he &apos;s upsetting me .
you should go .
i &apos;ll go .
look at these prices , erica .
it &apos;s gonna be so much fun . discount barn , here we come .
no ! no discount barn or huts or warehouses .
i &apos;m tired of always asking you guys for money .
i &apos;getting a job .
a job ? you &apos;re just a child .
i can &apos;t have you losing a foot in a forklift accident .
forklift ?
patty newsome &apos;s son got his foot crushed
his first day at the lumberyard .
he &apos;ll never bike through europe now .
is that what you want ?
brenda said she could get me a job with her at gimbels , okay ?
i &apos;ll finally have my own money .
plus i get a big employee discount .
that magic word was all my mom needed to hear .
well , who am i to stand in your way ?
that settles it . you &apos;re getting a discount .
job . you &apos;re getting a job .
i &apos;m just so happy for us .
you . i &apos;m happy for all of us .
oh . discount .
it was november 19th , 1980 @-@ something ,
and like every afternoon , i was spending quality time
with my good friend nintendo .
come on , slugger . let &apos;s hit the track .
the ponies are waiting .
one sec . i &apos;m so close to winning &quot; zelda , &quot;
i can taste it .
six months of hard work is about to pay off .
you know what i did in six months ?
win world war ii .
i get it ! you lived a rich life ! enough !
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m under a lot of pressure here .
this game is all i have .
guess whose life sucks a big sack of marbles .
just guess .
all right , barry , what now ?
first period , backpack rips open . bad luck .
second period , i fail my pop quiz . super bad luck .
third period gym , we &apos;re playing basketball ,
and a bird dooks on my face .
he dooks on my face !
actually , when a bird goes poo @-@ poo on you ,
it &apos;s good luck .
oh , really ? well , after school ,
i asked jen sperling to the winter formal ,
and she told me ryan corbett just asked her
two minutes before me .
i don &apos;t just have bad luck . i have barry luck .
why don &apos;t you come to the track with us ?
pops , don &apos;t do that . he &apos;s a jinx .
shut up ! i &apos;ll blind you with my fists !
but he &apos;s right . i &apos;m the worst .
stop talking that way .
all you need is a positive attitude ,
and you &apos;ll find your luck &apos;s as good as anyone &apos;s .
you think ?
i know .
you &apos;re sitting on my bagel bites .
what ?
damn it !
stupid barry luck !
thanks for coming . come back soon .
how are we doing over here ?
terrific . just sold an extended warranty
for a basketball .
nice work , erica . you keep that up ,
and pretty soon , you &apos;ll be wearing this vest .
well , not this exact one .
there &apos;s a different style ... for the ladies .
just to be clear , i &apos;m not hitting on you .
okay .
there &apos;s my little worker bee .
buzz , buzz .
mom , what are you doing here ?
just wanted to come by and see my daughter
on her first day of work .
and while i &apos;m here ,
i picked up a couple of essentials .
some fiddle faddle ...
videotapes for adam , a clapper for dad so he can ...
turn the lights off from bed ,
cologne for pops ...
and an athletic supporter and cup for barry . look at this .
i &apos;m darth vader .
erica , i am your mother .
give me your discount .
oh , but seriously ,
give me your discount .
i &apos;ve only been here an hour .
i &apos;m not even sure how that works .
the discount policy extends to the employee &apos;s immediate family ,
and that &apos;s me .
how do you even know that ?
well , i took a look @-@ see
inside the employee lounge and checked out the handbook .
fine . i &apos;ll give you my discount ,
just as long as you stay out of the lounge .
okay .
with the discount ...
it comes to ...
$ 17.10 .
and ... damn it , i &apos;m good .
mom--
i &apos;m so proud of us .
yes ! yes ! move your ass ! move it !
move it ! that &apos;s it !
yes , yes !
no !
son of a bitch !
damn it !
the one day i wear a ketchup @-@ colored shirt !
come on . i got an idea .
hey , barry . barry , wait up .
i lost three in a row , pops . can we just go ?
why would we go ?
you didn &apos;t lose that race . you won .
really ?
really ?
really . when i placed your bet ,
i also picked the trifecta ,
then boxed the quinella ,
and wheeled the exacta .
that means you win for coming in last .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
of course it does . it &apos;s like in golf .
the person who gets the lowest score wins .
that does happen in golf !
you just won yourself 20 bucks .
now that &apos;s barry luck .
chili dogs on me , baby !
told you i had a plan .
where &apos;s the snack bar ?
while pops was making barry &apos;s life better ,
over the next week ,
my mom continued making erica &apos;s a living hell .
this is the last outfit left in adam &apos;s size ,
so i &apos;ll just bring the mannequin back tomorrow .
mom , this is the fourth time you &apos;ve been here this week .
actually , it &apos;s the fifth . i came in on your day off ,
and randy let me use his discount .
i don &apos;t wanna get in trouble .
donald said i &apos;m being considered for assistant manager .
oh , my god . that would be amazing !
according to the handbook , you &apos;d get another 10 % off .
mom , you &apos;re not listening .
and you &apos;re not making with the beep @-@ bop @-@ boop .
i &apos;m sorry , honey . i &apos;ve gotta speed this along .
i &apos;ve got lunch plans .
you can &apos;t be back here .
it &apos;ll just take a minute .
you &apos;re messing with my drawer . i have a system !
thanks , poopie .
yeah , we need to talk .
i know , i know .
look , you &apos;ve become a really special member
of the gimbels family .
technically , your mom is allowed to use your discount ,
but in my heart , it just feels wrong .
i get that .
you get that
if you don &apos;t get rid of her , i will fire you ?
i didn &apos;t get that . but now i do .
good . make sure we get the mannequin back .
erica knew someone had to go ,
and it wasn &apos;t gonna be her .
so when my mom came in the next day , she was ready .
here you go . four snow pants , four parkas ,
three sets of mittens , and of course , fiddle faddle .
and it practically all pays for itself
with my employee discount .
have i told you that you &apos;re my favorite child ?
i &apos;m gonna say it at the dinner table tonight .
i literally love you the most .
bye , sweetie .
bye .
sorry , ma &apos;am . we &apos;re gonna need to go through your bags .
oh . of course .
you know , i come here all the time .
it &apos;s just standard procedure .
i honestly ... don &apos;t know how that got in there .
can you come with me , please ?
why ? i didn &apos;t take it .
i don &apos;t even wear white diamonds .
it &apos;s not my signature scent .
come on .
don &apos;t put your hands on me !
i have rights .
we don &apos;t need to make a scene .
erica ! call mr. gimbel .
tell him one of his best customers is in trouble
and needs his help .
i &apos;d rather not get involved , ma &apos;am .
you . i &apos;ve been framed . she framed me with snow pants .
oh ! please hold on to my merchandise
until i can get this sorted out !
now that barry &apos;s luck had changed ,
he was sure it was contagious .
i &apos;m on fire , baby !
that was all me . i scored that goal .
what are you talking about ?
my awesome luck &apos;s going right through the tv
and into the flyers .
that &apos;s true . whenever something good happens ,
we call it barry luck .
is that what you called it when he bit into his own hand
at dinner the other night ?
that &apos;s old barry .
you ate all the fiddle !
it &apos;s all faddle now , you moron .
hey , kiddo . how was work ?
good . good .
another day , another dollar .
you .
you gave me no choice .
you were using me as a human discount .
who has their own mother arrested ? who does that ?
and to think i almost bought you snow pants ?
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . all right , what &apos;s going on here ?
your own daughter had me hauled off to jail .
it was the mall security office next to the orange julius .
it was jail . it was small and stuffy ,
and they took a very unflattering polaroid of me .
look at it . look at it .
look at it .
wait . did you steal that ?
you were there for stealing .
i was providing this family with the essential items
that make this household run ,
like food , clothing , fiddle faddle .
that &apos;s what i do . tell her , murray .
he agrees with me . you framed the woman
who gave birth to you . bravo .
damn it !
murray .
go to your room while i figure out your punishment .
i &apos;m 17 . you can &apos;t just send me to my room .
oh , i can , and i will , and i just did .
it &apos;s my job as your mother .
job ? please . you &apos;ve never had a job a day in your life .
you &apos;re just a mom .
it had been three days
since erica questioned my mom &apos;s entire reason for being ,
so beverly goldberg did the only reasonable thing
she could think of .
she went on strike .
hey , honey .
uh , just talking with the boys ,
and we were kind of wondering where we are
on tonight &apos;s dinner situation .
ooh . i just made myself
a delicious piece of teriyaki salmon ,
but , uh , oh , i think there &apos;s cold cuts in the fridge .
look , bevy ,
i know you &apos;re trying to make a point here ,
but it &apos;s been three days .
i had to wear my tuxedo shirt to work !
yes , i did look like roger moore ,
but don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time you called off this fight ?
there &apos;s no fight . all that happened
was my daughter gently suggested that my life is meaningless .
oh , here &apos;s our little angel now .
if you have a problem , you should take it up with her .
what ?
you know what .
you broke mom .
while my mom and erica continued their battle ,
my battle with &quot; zelda &quot;
was about to come to a glorious end .
okay . don &apos;t touch anything in there .
i &apos;m about to win &quot; zelda . &quot;
i gotta grab my video camera and record this moment .
&apos;cause it &apos;s literally the biggest day of my life .
well , who &apos;s zelda ? your--your girlfriend ?
no . it &apos;s the game i &apos;ve been playing for the last six months .
it &apos;s all i talk about . were you even listening ?
i think you answered your own question there .
don &apos;t let anyone near the tv !
oh , my god , it &apos;s happening !
dad . you won &apos;t believe the day i had .
first i aced my math quiz . &quot; b &quot; -minus .
then bio lab got flooded ,
so we had class in the quad ,
where a bird did not crap on me .
then after school ,
jen sperling asked me to the dance
&apos;cause her date got ...
viral meningitis .
oh , good for you . bad for him . but good for you .
his brain is swollen ! everything &apos;s coming up barry .
barry was on a lucky streak , and i was gonna pay the price .
i was one button click away
from winning &quot; the legend of zelda . &quot;
unfortunately , i wasn &apos;t the one
who got to click the button .
see that ?
i literally can &apos;t lose .
no , no ! no !
what did you do ? !
you stupid , stupid man .
dude ! what &apos;s your problem ?
i &apos;ve been playing that game for six months !
and i beat it in six seconds .
guess that &apos;s just barry luck .
you &apos;re not lucky . you didn &apos;t win a single race at the track .
i won the exacta ! you just don &apos;t understand golf .
you don &apos;t understand anything .
no one wins for coming in last .
pops made it all up .
what ?
pops would never screw with me like that . tell him .
you can win tons of money for coming in last .
that &apos;s right ! and one day , you &apos;ll ride a unicorn ,
and you &apos;ll live in a house made of candy .
just to be clear-- you won &apos;t .
and just like that , barry &apos;s lucky streak ended .
you okay ?
yeah . i ...
finally made enough money
to buy the dress i wanted at work ,
and apparently , taffeta melts .
apologize to your mom .
dad ...
not just for you , but for me , too .
there &apos;s no food in the house . today i had to eat an apple .
i &apos;m not gonna apologize to mom because you had to eat fruit .
i know your mom gets carried away ,
but everything she does , she does for this family .
it &apos;s her job .
and she doesn &apos;t get any employee discounts ,
and all her customers-- jerks ! every one of &apos; em .
you may not wanna do what your mom does
when you grow up ,
but you gotta learn to respect it .
after learning pops had tricked him ,
bad luck barry set out to get his revenge .
thanks for agreeing to bring me back here , pops .
i &apos;m on such a lucky streak , figured i &apos;d let it ride .
well , what &apos;ll it be , kiddo ?
there are some great odds on semi @-@ charmed .
no . i &apos;m gonna bet colonel seymour .
colonel seymour ?
he &apos;s 40 to 1 .
you could jump on my back , and we &apos;d beat him .
well , with barry luck , i can &apos;t lose ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m barry and i &apos;m lucky .
right ? right ?
here &apos;s all the money to my name--
birthdays , allowance ,
money i stole from adam-- bet it all .
i don &apos;t think you should make this bet , kid .
why not ? i mean , you told me i &apos;m lucky ,
and it &apos;s not like my grandfather
would lie to my face for a week straight .
right ?
right ?
so i &apos;m guessing you know .
yeah , i know ! adam told me everything .
i &apos;m a completely jinx , and you know it .
kiddo , you just had the week of your life ,
and you know why ?
&apos;cause you were thinking positive for a change .
yeah , &apos; cause thinking positive got me a hot date ,
good grades , and stopped my night terrors .
yes ! look , there &apos;s no such thing as luck .
it &apos;s all about betting on yourself .
that &apos;s when things really change .
guess it was a good week .
so , uh , you &apos;re still gonna bet
on this crazy long shot colonel seymour ?
nah . i think i &apos;m gonna sit this one out .
and the winner is colonel seymour
by half a length .
pops , how much would i have won ?
somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 4,253 .
what are you doing out here ?
had to get out of that stinky house .
it smells like a diaper fire .
these are comfortable .
it &apos;s comfort spring technology .
look , i was pissed . i shouldn &apos;t have said all that .
i know what you do is a job .
you know , when i was younger , i was really good in school .
i got straight a &apos;s . i was a real good arguer ,
and people used to say ,
&quot; beverly solomon , you should be a lawyer . &quot;
that wasn &apos;t my dream .
my dream was to have a family .
my dream was this .
you &apos;re really good at it .
but it &apos;s not for everyone .
you want different things out of life ,
and ... that &apos;s okay .
you sure ?
honey , you are a pain in my ass ,
and you never listen to a word i say ,
but the way you had me booted out of that store ...
you &apos;re gonna make a great assistant manager one day .
i &apos;m sorry i got you sent to mall jail .
i &apos;m sorry i got carried away with your discount .
i know i get crazy when it comes to shopping .
i will try to work on that .
no , you won &apos;t .
i really won &apos;t .
listen , i need your help .
i kinda ironed my dress .
honey , you don &apos;t iron taffeta .
it &apos;s okay . mama will fix it .
here you go , sweetie . made your lunch .
have a good day at work .
you , too .
yeah , in my family , we yelled and swore
and sometimes framed each other for petty crimes ,
but under all that crazy ,
we were always there to support each other .
&quot; zelda ii &quot; ? ! seriously ? !
i saved some money at the track . come on .
let &apos;s go play .
aw , look at my delicious little boy !
lucky guy .
she looks amazing .
how &apos;d you fix her dress ?
easy . i just bought her a new one .
and every now and then , we even made each other &apos;s lives
just a little bit easier .
what is this ?
figured it was our turn to make you dinner .
oh , my gosh . that is so sweet !
so exciting .
tough on the top and has a jelly coating on the bottom .
is that baking soda ?
why don &apos;t i just whip something up ?
thank god .
perfect .
i love you guys .
look what i swiped from the security office at work .
you can &apos;t detain me ! i have rights !
i almost went to law school .
i am a female woman , and i am being held against my will .
nobody knows
the trouble i &apos;ve seen
this prison can &apos;t hold me !
let me out !
you may have caged my body ,
but you have not caged my mind !
do you think this is funny ?
i know what you &apos;re doing back there .
i can see you !
you will not break my spirit .
how long was she in there ?
12 minutes .
please don &apos;t do that now .
don &apos;t do that .
that &apos;s a nice sweater . where &apos;d you get that ?
