sir , sir , you need to come with us .
hey , no , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not going to america , um ...
i was in the wrong line .
excuse me , what &apos;s the problem here ?
no , i &apos;m not going to america .
i &apos;m staying in canada .
all right , gentlemen , please , i need you to back away .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m a peel regional police officer
and i need to ascertain what this is all about .
and i &apos;m a u.s. customs and border protection officer ,
and he &apos;s in u.s. preclearance and under our jurisdiction .
well , no , actually , that &apos;s not true .
you &apos;re on canadian soil , you see , so until ...
that &apos;s easily fixed .
well , i never gave him my passport !
i never gave him my passport .
no , no , we &apos;re not doing ...
the middle of the preclearance process .
relax .
i want my lawyer !
i want to call my lawyer !
why would i ever get out of bed ?
life ?
your phone has been ringing .
i &apos;m throwing it away .
what ?
i need to tell you something .
you killed a man in reno .
yeah ...
lucca told you ?
hey , we all make mistakes .
so ... i don &apos;t want you to get worried
about this because it has nothing to do with you .
what doesn &apos;t ?
this thing ...
that i &apos;m going to tell you .
i was gonna do it anyway .
okay .
so , that &apos;s a bad preamble .
i should have just said it .
now you &apos;re all braced .
here ...
unbrace yourself .
okay .
you know , we &apos;ll talk later , this was stupid .
no , no , no .
what , alicia ?
i &apos;m getting divorced .
okay , i shouldn &apos;t have said anything because
it has nothing to do with you .
i just didn &apos;t want you to hear about it
and think that i was ...
you know ...
no , i don &apos;t know .
... expecting something from this .
makes sense .
okay .
i just ...
that &apos;s your phone .
don &apos;t go anywhere , okay ?
alicia florrick .
what ?
jeff ?
where are you ?
okay .
okay !
i &apos;m on my way .
no , no ... hold on , hold on , this is my call @-@ waiting .
alicia florrick .
eli ... your name didn &apos;t come up .
i know , i borrowed an intern &apos;s phone so you wouldn &apos;t ignore me .
peter is being arrested .
what ?
i &apos;m in negotiations with the u.s. attorney .
i need you to explain to him
why peter can &apos;t be arraigned today .
anything will do .
are you serious ?
yes !
the grand jury delivered a true bill .
it just happened .
how long will it take you to get here ?
well , i can &apos;t today .
i have to go to toronto .
you what ? !
why ? !
i have a client up there .
i promised him .
not today .
okay , it looks like we can hold this off until tomorrow .
when do you get back ?
tonight .
okay , good .
he is the governor of the state .
he is the corrupt governor of a state who arranged
a mistrial in trade for campaign donations .
allegedly .
may i remind you this appearance negotiation
is a courtesy my office extends to certain
high profile defendants ,
and i can end it at any time .
the governor is being briefed on homeland security tomorrow ...
unless you want to be seen as endangering that .
noon tomorrow-- that &apos;s the best i can give you .
at your office ,
not the apartment .
fine .
with no handcuffs .
handcuffs are not optional .
not behind his back , do it in front
where he can put a jacket over it .
i am executing an arrest warrant ,
not stage managing a tv event .
and we ...
are trying to maintain
the dignity of this office ,
so the governor does not look like khalid mohammed
being dragged out of his apartment in a t @-@ shirt .
okay .
agreed .
i don &apos;t like canada .
it &apos;s too clean .
i always want to litter here .
where do we go ?
alicia ?
what ?
where do we go ?
are you okay ?
yeah , um , they said
the peel regional police office .
do you still talk to jason ?
do i ?
yeah .
he &apos;s good , right ?
he &apos;s fine with things ?
yeah , he likes work ,
he likes the consistent money ...
or is that what you &apos;re asking ?
yeah ... yeah .
cute hats .
this is an airport and not an embassy .
you &apos;re on canadian soil .
alicia , over here .
he crossed the line into preclearance .
which is not an international border .
the united states holds jurisdiction
over its preclearance area .
jeff , how are you ?
well , that depends .
there seems to be some question
about where my feet stood .
hi .
lucca quinn .
jeff dellinger ,
a c @-@ list edward snowden .
let &apos;s not joke about that , please .
gentlemen , hello .
i &apos;m alicia florrick ,
this is lucca quinn .
we &apos;re representing mr. dellinger &apos;s interests .
there are no interests .
this is purely a jurisdictional issue .
then you have no interest in mr. dellinger ?
purely an interest in your jurisdiction ?
mr. dellinger is an american citizen .
he has been traveling abroad .
he had purchased a ticket
to phoenix , arizona ...
my mom &apos;s funeral .
and we have a few questions for him .
that is all .
would these questions have
anything to do with his recent work
as a national security agency contractor ?
this is purely
about which country holds sway
over a preclearance area in an international airport .
diane , hi .
no , toronto .
um , i have a quick question .
who knows the most about international law ?
unfortunately , that was cary .
why ?
oh , okay , well ...
let me see if i can find anyone .
hey , um , what about jason ?
uh , he helped me on a case once .
did you know he used to be a lawyer ?
yes , i did know that .
do you want me to have him call you ?
no , no , that &apos;s okay , i &apos;ll call .
i &apos;ll talk to you .
let me guess ...
you have to go ?
no , not yet .
not yet means ...
20 minutes .
we can do a lot in 20 minutes .
you &apos;re dressed .
it &apos;s never stopped us before .
let &apos;s talk .
what ?
no , i was just-- i @-@ i &apos;ve never heard
you use those words before .
what &apos;s wrong ?
all i said was , &quot; let &apos;s talk . &quot;
sit down , this is hard for me .
oh , my god , what ?
would you wait ?
why is everything suddenly bad ?
we &apos;ve been married now for three years and
i &apos;ve seen you , maybe , 98 days over that time .
well , you &apos;re at trials .
i mean , i &apos;m ... i run a law firm .
that &apos;s just who we are .
diane , i &apos;m selling my business .
i want to move in together ...
full @-@ time .
you bastard .
you had me so worried .
i thought you wanted a divorce !
i don &apos;t .
well , did you tell your face ?
you can &apos;t use
the same expression for everything .
so , do you not want me to move in ?
yeah ...
yeah , i think our teeth hit .
okay .
okay .
look , this is what i need ,
if you &apos;re up for this , too .
i have a buyer for my business
and i need you to review the contracts .
so this is happening ?
i have an offer .
will you review the contracts ?
hey , so you there ?
yes , canada .
very clean , i hear .
um , i &apos;ll be back tonight .
i have a quick question .
shoot .
can u.s. customs and border protection
detain an american in a canadian airport ?
no .
wait , with one exception .
how do you know that ?
well , i brought mushrooms back from winnipeg once ,
so i checked .
well , that &apos;s very revealing .
um ... i have someone
in the u.s. preclearance and customs area ,
one foot in , one foot out .
this is a matter of ...
hey , what do you got ?
alicia florrick talking trial strategy .
on what ?
on dellinger .
even if you &apos;re just using
toronto as a hub ,
you pass through u.s. customs in canada ,
not the u.s.
who &apos;s that ?
the investigator she &apos;s sleeping with .
shut up , j.
it &apos;s the investigator from her firm ...
the one she &apos;s ...
sleeping with .
now , the only way a preclearance officer
can detain you is if you make
a false or deceptive statement to them .
all right .
send me the recording .
don &apos;t you think you want me on this , too ?
sorry , j.
how are your tax accountants ?
i &apos;ll call you later , okay ?
we &apos;re free to go .
they &apos;re bringing in a justice
tomorrow to decide .
seriously ?
they &apos;re keeping dellinger overnight .
i &apos;ll stay .
you go home .
okay , thanks .
my husband , he &apos;s ...
having issues .
so , you &apos;ll turn yourself in tomorrow at noon .
alicia will come with you .
they will process you
and release you on a signature bond .
i &apos;ve set a press conference for 2 : 00 .
there &apos;ll be no media with the ausa ,
so we &apos;ll get the first word .
and that word is &quot; witch hunt . &quot;
that &apos;s two words .
i know , i was just going with what eli was ...
alicia .
good , good .
come in .
to my house ?
yes , i &apos;m sorry .
um , there were cameras outside
the governor &apos;s residence .
how was toronto ?
complicated but clean .
how are you ?
anxious .
anyone ?
uh , yes , that would be good .
so what do you need from me ?
we were just discussing strategy .
what do you think of the
kids joining you at a press conference ?
sure ...
when ?
you don &apos;t mind the kids
being in front of the cameras ?
no .
should i ?
it &apos;s just ,
you &apos;ve always minded before ...
whenever i &apos;ve asked .
things have changed . their dad &apos;s in trouble .
i &apos;d rather they didn &apos;t do that .
zach &apos;s in college .
grace is gonna be there soon .
i want them to focus on that .
okay , we &apos;ll work with it ,
and we want you there
walking with peter for the perp walk .
is grace home ?
no , she &apos;s at jackie &apos;s .
mrs. florrick , i have a warrant here
for the arrest of peter florrick .
he screwed us .
he wants to
embarrass you by dragging
you out in your shirt sleeves .
he &apos;s got tv cameras , too .
mr. florrick ,
you &apos;re under arrest .
governor florrick , you son of a bitch .
you were just delaying so you could coordinate strategy .
there was no homeland security meeting .
please cuff the governor .
please take your hands out of your pockets .
put your hands where i can see them .
are you on any prescription medication ?
mrs. florrick , please step back .
you have the right to remain silent .
‭ do you have any health concerns we should know about ?
anything you say or do can and will be used against you in a ...
no , mrs. florrick , this is not a photo op .
you will not embarrass my husband .
thank you .
hey ... we &apos;ll handle this .
all right , thank you , that &apos;s enough , let &apos;s go .
governor florrick was arrested last night
on charges of bribery ...
not as bad as it could have been .
we need to ask for a speedy trial .
we need to find out what they have .
i &apos;m hiring an investigator .
good .
someone independent .
it can &apos;t be anyone from here .
don &apos;t worry .
i have someone in mind .
good morning , all .
i &apos;m the justice of the peace , nora valentine .
welcome .
the issue , as i understand it ,
is about the preclearance act of 2001 .
yes , your honor .
mr. dellinger crossed the line
into u.s. preclearance where we detained him
because of a statement that he made ...
but they only
detained him after he crossed back across the line .
he did not cross completely back across the line ...
he did cross completely back across the line .
... which is why we detained him ...
thank you ...
and you all are americans , is that right ?
well , let &apos;s leave
the land of guns and gangs behind us , shall we ,
and not interrupt each other .
also , as i am a
justice of the peace and not a judge ,
you should refer to me as your worship
and not your honor .
now , i know that
may sound foreign to american ears ,
but that &apos;s the way we do it here .
now , then ... my understanding ...
do not leave your luggage unattended .
unattended luggage will be confiscated or destroyed .
is there any way to turn that off ?
no , uh , unfortunately not .
i didn &apos;t think you were coming .
thanks for doing this .
no problem .
your honor ...
worship .
worship ?
your ... worship ,
according to the preclearance act
of 2001 , the country of destination
can detain a passenger
if that passenger has , in some way , lied
to the preclearance officer ,
and our client did not lie .
is that right , mr .... ?
gerald gallo , your worship .
it is not .
if i may , the preclearance officer ,
ms. ordonez .
i asked mr. dellinger
if he ever committed a crime ...
and he said no .
she &apos;s lying . that &apos;s a lie .
sir ...
there was no exchange ...
... we will refrain from american @-@ style interruptions .
given that mr. dellinger
lied , the united states is within its rights to detain him .
may we have a moment , your hon--
worship , uh , to ... gather a piece of evidence ?
you may .
no , don &apos;t .
why ?
are we under surveillance ?
i wouldn &apos;t take that chance .
uh @-@ oh .
what ?
they &apos;re avoiding phones .
dellinger knows we &apos;re here .
i know that-- that &apos;s why i said , &quot; uh @-@ oh . &quot;
... released on his own recognizance .
okay , i looked into it .
yeah , i saw .
... with his wife alicia florrick at his side .
is this good publicity or bad ?
we should call the clients .
my guess is , they won &apos;t care
unless peter florrick goes down .
okay , so what did you find ?
that your husband shouldn &apos;t sell his business ,
at least not to pgt ballistics .
they &apos;re offering 60 % of its value .
what did you find ?
the same .
so , why is he selling his company
for so little ?
he may not know ,
or he may just want out fast .
why out fast ?
to live his life .
you should talk to him .
ask him why .
well , he &apos;s a proud man .
he doesn &apos;t want his wife
telling him he &apos;s undervaluing himself .
then you should talk to pgt ballistics .
tell them to pay more .
this is a witch hunt , pure and simple .
my husband has done nothing wrong .
hello .
mr. crouse , i need you ,
again , to investigate .
investigate what ?
this .
i don &apos;t think you want me .
i think i do .
when can you start ?
is this coming from the governor ?
no ...
it &apos;s coming from me .
do me a favor .
talk to the governor .
if he &apos;s all right with it ,
then i &apos;m all right with it .
i have a better plan .
i &apos;ll talk to the governor ,
but you start right now .
i need to know what the prosecutor has
and i &apos;m already behind .
your honor , the united states ...
worship .
your worship ,
the united states objects to the admission of this tape .
it &apos;s been authenticated .
excuse me ,
the canadian authorities gave us this tape .
i objected to the admission
of this tape ...
again , one at a time .
it doesn &apos;t look like mr. dellinger
said anything before they grabbed him ,
therefore he couldn &apos;t have lied .
but the angle is ... i reject the united states &apos; claim
that they &apos;re entitled to custody of mr. dellinger .
in that case , your worship ,
the united states moves for extradition .
on what basis ?
there &apos;s no outstanding warrants for mr. dellinger &apos;s arrest .
actually , there is .
he &apos;s wanted for violations
of the espionage act .
when was this issued ?
ten minutes ago ?
it &apos;s a valid warrant ,
regardless of when it was issued .
your worship , they have obviously
detained my client on a trumped up pretext
to give them time to get a trumped up warrant .
what exactly is mr. dellinger accused of ?
attention , terminal 3 is a nonsmoking terminal .
designated smoking areas can be found throughout the terminal .
as an employee of the national security agency ,
he stole and disseminated classified documents .
that &apos;s a lie .
i accidentally took home a @-@ a thumb drive .
that , young man , is a matter for an american court to decide .
in order to extradite , the united states need only
to show sufficient evidence to bring this to trial , which ,
i &apos;m afraid , they have .
do your lawyers have anything
to present before i rule ?
we do , your worship , uh , but we need time ...
to produce a witness .
we &apos;ve delayed enough already .
yes , and i &apos;m sure your work at the nsa is very important ,
surveilling your country &apos;s citizens .
excuse me , your honor ,
but i &apos;m not sure i appreciate the tone .
i &apos;m only remarking now as a canadian citizen .
it would be better if our neighbors from the south
would try to emulate the freedoms we enjoy here ,
with no surveillance and with our superior health care system .
do not leave your luggage unattended .
unattended luggage will be confiscated .
the judge is leaning towards extradition ,
but dellinger &apos;s lawyer , supposedly , has another witness .
any idea who that might be ?
no , and they &apos;re avoiding all phones right now .
do we have any other way to listen ?
any other way to surveil alicia ?
a hot mic , but they aren &apos;t even talking
near their phones &apos; cause ...
dellinger knows our tricks .
no , but here &apos;s the thing .
if they do have a witness
swearing to dellinger &apos;s performance , we have a rebuttal .
who &apos;s talking ?
the americans .
nsa , toronto to chicago .
what &apos;s it about ?
jeff dellinger .
he &apos;s the contractor the americans lost last year .
i told you they &apos;d be after him .
you didn &apos;t tell me anything .
it was obvious .
but what &apos;s being discussed ?
trial strategy .
want us to ignore ?
no , keep listening .
nice suit .
you were expecting sweatpants ?
you said this wasn &apos;t about the firm .
peter florrick .
the locke mistrial .
well , i &apos;m sure you read the file .
i read what &apos;s public .
i want to know what &apos;s not .
richard locke murdered his girlfriend ,
shot her twice in the chest .
our theory was that locke was getting two @-@ timed
and he got jealous .
defense said it was an accident .
which was true ?
maybe neither .
but you went to trial .
we had a good case .
we would have gotten the conviction .
if the bullets hadn &apos;t gone missing .
how &apos;d that happen ?
some people blame the lead prosecutor ;
i blame the crime lab .
they &apos;re pretty inept .
so , the lab tech was corrupt .
probably just sloppy ... incompetent .
that must have blindsided you .
we were already at trial .
we turned over our ballistics testing .
defense requested
the bullets to do their own testing .
but when they couldn &apos;t be found ...
judge granted a mistrial ,
and since jeopardy was already attached ...
he couldn &apos;t be retried .
connor fox is gonna say that peter ordered someone to lose
those bullets , and it &apos;s more likely
that he leaned on the lead prosecutor
than some lab tech .
that i will not say .
anything else i should know ?
just that people change .
meaning ?
ah , it &apos;s just an observation , i ...
i think i know people ...
even well .
you talking about someone in particular ?
does peter florrick have any reason
to be concerned about you ?
me ?
your testimony ?
only if he has reason
to be concerned about the truth .
so , cary ...
thinks the lab is responsible .
he does .
&quot; inept , &quot; &quot; incompetent , &quot; and &quot; sloppy &quot;
were the words he used .
what &apos;s the difference between inept and incompetent ?
about six letters .
that is both correct and accurate .
you may have a problem with cary .
why ?
he &apos;s testifying ?
okay , well ...
see if you can get an early look at the discovery ;
i &apos;m getting nothing .
jason , what are you doing here ?
he &apos;s our investigator .
jason , would you excuse us for a moment ?
we need to put a pin in this .
we need to put a pin in jason ?
you know what i mean .
i have to talk to peter .
that &apos;s what jason suggested .
is there something i don &apos;t know ?
no .
he &apos;s worked for us before .
he &apos;s still working for alicia ,
and he &apos;s preternaturally calm .
well , i have to talk to peter .
but i have free rein to hire who i want .
no one has free rein .
ms. lockhart ,
pgt ballistics is here .
uh , yes , send them back .
so , fair market value ?
higher .
really ? how much higher ?
$ 600,000 .
seriously ?
hello , diane , mr. lee .
are you with pgt ballistics ?
i am pgt ballistics .
really ?
oh , the name gives me more gravitas .
holly westfall .
so , you &apos;re a competitor of mr. mcveigh &apos;s ?
more of a friendly competitor .
i was one of kurt &apos;s first students .
his favorite , as he &apos;s constantly reminding me .
would you like me to take care of this , diane ?
no , let &apos;s all sit down together .
so ... how did you , uh ...
hit on the price for the purchase of kurt &apos;s firm ?
holly , is it ?
it is . oh , i like your necklace .
oh , thank you .
i have one just like it ,
but smaller .
kurt and i were at a gun show in wisconsin
and we were talking about the generational shifts
in the science .
you know , there &apos;s old @-@ school ballistics and new ,
and kurt believes that you can &apos;t teach an old dog
new tricks , and i just kept telling him ,
&quot; but you &apos;re not old . &quot;
hmm . and then he laughed and i just said ...
ms. westfall , you &apos;re very charming , i &apos;m sure ,
but unless you can pay 30 % more , we &apos;re not selling .
kurt and i had an agreement .
unfortunately not on paper .
maybe i should just talk to kurt .
i &apos;d be happy to arrange a meeting for you to sit down
with both of us , but unless you can increase your offer ,
you can go f ...
do you want me to do anything ?
welcome to toronto pearson international airport .
please have your passport and customs form ready .
alicia florrick .
yes ... tyler ?
yeah .
oh , you look taller than i thought .
how is zach doing ?
and , grace , has she picked a college yet ?
yes ... uh , have we met before ?
no , this is the first time .
you worked with jeff dellinger ?
for five years , cubicle by cubicle .
and you were working with him , next to him ,
when this alleged espionage took place ?
i don &apos;t know why they call it espionage .
he took home a flash drive ... accidentally .
it was classified .
yeah , but you only classified it after the fact ,
after you started scapegoating him .
mr. froines , to your knowledge ,
did mr. dellinger access
classified documents and information
while he worked under you ?
he did more that that .
he ... downloaded classified material
and leaked it to journalists .
what ? !
this is incredible , the story just keeps ...
mr. dellinger , politeness , please !
your worship , the leaking of classified material ...
he &apos;s lying .
he hates me because i got him fired .
you said you were a former senior advisor at the nsa ,
mr. froines . why were you fired ?
on suspicion of eavesdropping on my ex @-@ wife .
did mr. dellinger play a role in your firing ?
he made the allegations .
your worship , may i recall tyler hopkins ?
he &apos;s sitting right over there .
just ask him a question .
you &apos;ve maintained your friendship with jeff dellinger
since he left the nsa ,
and occasionally you two talk on the phone ?
yeah .
i &apos;d like to play one of those phone calls for you now .
objection !
we have no way of knowing
if this recording is authentic
or if it was legally obtained .
let &apos;s play the recording
and take it one step at a time .
that &apos;s how we do things in canada .
they &apos;re gonna kill an american .
who is ?
the military .
they &apos;re gonna take out this guy massoud tahan .
they convened a panel to convict him .
he &apos;s not even a frontline guy .
he &apos;s a recruiter .
mr. hopkins , that was your voice , wasn &apos;t it ?
he &apos;s not answering that .
you don &apos;t need to .
mr. hopkins committed a serious security leak
by sharing that information with mr. dellinger ,
but mr. dellinger then committed an even more serious offense
by sending that information
to both the state department and wikileaks .
your worship , may i have a moment with my client ?
attention , terminal 3 is a nonsmoking terminal .
go ahead , yes !
designated smoking areas can be found throughout the terminal .
is it true ?
did you leak ?
people have a right to know what america is doing
in the name of national security .
i was on that panel , jeff .
someone else was blamed for what you did
and got fired after 24 years of honorable service .
so don &apos;t play the idealist to me .
designated smoking areas can be found throughout the terminal .
i was on the panel
that made the decision to kill massoud tahan .
someone else was blamed for that leak ,
a captain terrence hicks .
i can neither confirm nor deny .
well , i can .
actually , you can &apos;t !
you swore confidentiality on that panel .
you shouldn &apos;t even be telling me about it .
well , you can &apos;t blame both captain hicks and jeff dellinger
for the same leak .
i don &apos;t .
i only blame jeff ,
and you can &apos;t say whatever it is you think you know
unless you &apos;d like to face an espionage charge .
jason crouse .
are you kidding ?
he &apos;s worked for us before .
he still works for alicia and he &apos;s very ... calm .
find somebody else .
mr. governor , if this has anything to do with your ...
eli ... find somebody else .
‭ we can &apos;t be overruling tascioni .
he needs to work with him , we don &apos;t .
alicia is divorcing me .
you didn &apos;t know ?
no .
did you explain to her how that would look ?
we &apos;re putting it in place now .
we won &apos;t activate it until after the trial .
well , that &apos;s good . ‭
yes , i &apos;m ... thrilled .
peter ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i truly am .
thank you .
attention , terminal 3 is a nonsmoking terminal .
designated smoking areas can be found throughout the terminal .
mr. hopkins ,
how did you come to know about
massoud tahan &apos;s assassination ?
objection .
this is classified .
he opened the door .
if he wants the recording to come in as evidence ,
then i must be allowed to fully cross @-@ examine the witness
on what was discussed .
he can &apos;t have his cake and eat it , too .
this is a national security matter !
everything in america
is a national security matter ,
but either you withdraw the recording ,
or the nsa &apos;s dirty undies get aired here and now .
now , then ...
how did you come to know about the assassination ?
we turned her cell phone into a hot mic
that we could contrl remotely without her knowing it .
whose cell phone ?
hers .
what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking they &apos;ve been listening to me for months ...
to everything ...
to jason ...
but i &apos;m also thinking the judge is on our side now .
what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking our client is guilty .
we &apos;ve represented guilty clients before .
not like this .
he went to wikileaks about a military action .
that , to me , is treason .
is it not to you ?
now , then ...
i have thought long and hard about this issue ,
and based on what i have heard ,
i find there is sufficient evidence
to substantiate the espionage charge ;
therefore , mr. dellinger &apos;s extradition is hereby approved .
ma &apos;am , we have one more motion to be considered .
we do ?
yes ?
could you live in canada ?
what ?
if the alternative is jail ,
could you live in canada ?
uh ... yes .
alicia .
mrs. florrick ...
you have a motion .
yes , ma &apos;am , we request asylum .
are you kidding ? !
jeff dellinger is a person in need of protection .
he &apos;s a traitor ,
who leaked classified agency information .
is there a problem , your worship ?
no .
no ...
i will take this under advisement .
who is that man ?
i ... heard gallo talking earlier .
he &apos;s from the cse .
what &apos;s cse ?
the communications security establishment .
it &apos;s a canadian version of the nsa .
i think we should talk .
okay .
i have faults .
i &apos;m , uh ...
easily mesmerized by people
who use multi @-@ syllabled words
and , um , men who can discuss tolstoy .
you never told me that .
yes , because i don &apos;t like my failings ...
but in the middle of the night when i review my day ,
i know that if a man has quoted tolstoy to me ,
i would be more likely to cut him a break .
i &apos;m disappointed in you .
yes .
i tell you this so that we can now discuss your failings .
yes .
you are easily swayed by pretty , young , blonde republicans .
this is about my sale to pgt .
yes .
i already shook on it .
yes , well , that means nothing to me .
you have undervalued your company
by half a million dollars .
i doubt that .
don &apos;t doubt that .
kurt , this is my plan .
i am going to sell your company
at its appropriate value and then i &apos;m gonna put
$ 500,000 in a fund for you to use to hire
republican strippers to your heart &apos;s content .
okay , thanks .
kurt , you are not gonna sell your company to some blonde ...
she is the top ballistics expert in the county .
and she dresses like one .
i have a handshake agreement with her .
i &apos;m honoring it .
over my dead body .
how are you ?
better than i would have thought .
the sun @-@ times says it &apos;s a witch hunt .
i know , i , i read that .
and you looked good .
on my perp walk ?
the media seems sympathetic .
how &apos;s your case going ?
oh , we should get the decision tomorrow .
the justice seems to be on our side .
oh , just in time for mother &apos;s party .
yeah , just in time .
connor fox sent over a plea bargain .
well , that &apos;s a good sign .
what is it ?
three years .
probation ?
oh , my god .
yeah , i know .
well , what ... what does tascioni say ?
he says they have a case .
oh , my god .
so we &apos;re right back where we started , huh ?
i am standing beside my husband again
because i know that he &apos;s innocent .
this is the second time ...
what makes you think it &apos;ll work ?
because dellinger has something to offer .
what &apos;s that ?
he knows the ins and outs of the nsa .
he knows how they hot @-@ mic .
so ...
so , dellinger was telling me
about the canadian cse ...
how the nsa does surveillance on it .
what are they talking about ?
do we do that ?
that &apos;s one of the reasons
why the nsa is working so hard to get dellinger back .
they don &apos;t want the canadians to have him .
call the system admin .
why ?
because i know what they &apos;re doing .
kim cattrall ?
canadian .
tommy chong ?
american .
no , canadian .
tommy chong is not canadian .
alberta , canada , i swear .
dana carvey ?
that &apos;s one of the reasons
why the nsa is working so hard
to get dellinger back .
they don &apos;t want the canadians to have him .
ike , get mcguire .
they just mentioned us .
after further reflection , i am granting mr. dellinger &apos;s
request for asylum here in canada .
what ? !
you got to be kidding me .
i don &apos;t understand what just happened . what ...
you &apos;re a valuable asset .
the canadians want you for themselves .
are you serious ?
mr. dellinger ,
might i have a word ?
you wanted to talk ?
kurt , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s your business , not mine .
you should sell it if you want
to whomever you want for whatever you want .
i &apos;m gonna look for another buyer .
we don &apos;t need the money .
you should do what you want .
i am .
i &apos;m gonna look for another buyer .
why ?
because i love you .
you make me happy , kurt .
i know .
it &apos;s been a while .
i heard toronto went well .
it did .
you want something to eat ?
no .
when i told you i was divorcing ,
i didn &apos;t mean for it to throw us off .
i know .
but it did throw us off ?
what do you want , alicia ?
what do i want ?
yeah .
why are you getting divorced ?
you may have heard ,
my husband slept with prostitutes .
that was seven years ago .
why now ?
because i want to .
because the kids are leaving home .
because ...
everything .
what do you want , jason ?
i want things simple .
yes , i know .
so you &apos;ve said .
unfortunately , things aren &apos;t simple .
i &apos;m not simple .
nothing &apos;s simple .
okay .
then what do you want ?
you .
