that &apos;s not gonna make her get here any faster .
maybe not , but it &apos;ll prove my point .
which is ... ?
which is if she &apos;d taken boylston street like i said ,
she would have been here 10 minutes ago .
she may not have the letter .
i went to see the department doctor a week ago .
i was fine then . i &apos;m finer now .
it &apos;s just taking them too long to clear me for duty .
okay , look , i know how badly
you really want to get back to work ,
but i must admit that
it &apos;s been really nice having you here ,
and i &apos;m sad that you &apos;re leaving .
me too .
so sad .
you know , you couldn &apos;t be happier
if i told you that i had magically turned
all the lettuce in the world into beer .
make it happen . we &apos;ll find out .
you should consider buying some luggage .
everybody thought i was homeless .
bags don &apos;t show dirt .
i &apos;ll take that .
it &apos;s not in -- ma , is this everything ?
yeah .
look , i understand you &apos;re disappointed ,
but the doctor must think
that you need some more time to heal .
no , i need to go back to my own apartment
and my job so i can feel like a grown woman .
a grown woman who uses garbage bags for luggage .
but i see your point .
lie down . i &apos;ll get you some snacks .
what am i supposed to do all day --
lay here and dream about a world with no salad ?
oh , you could read magazines , and you could --
you could just let your mom take care of you .
okay , but as my best friend and a doctor ,
will you do me one favor ?
anything .
put me in a medically induced coma .
i &apos;m going to the market .
just one little coma .
is it really too much to ask ?
you &apos;d have better luck asking me to give you oxycontin .
well , can i have some of those , then ?
hell of a way to get my attention , rick .
well , thanks for coming , vince .
as if i had a choice .
i &apos;ve barely seen you since high school ,
you tell me you &apos;re dying ,
and i &apos;m the only one you can trust with your final request .
well , what can i say ?
you won the last @-@ request competition .
who came in second ?
guy in cellblock &quot; d. &quot;
so , listen , vince , um ...
i got six months left ... tops .
i don &apos;t want to die with my son still thinking
that i set the fire
that killed his mother and his sister .
hey , i &apos;m a cop , not a hypnotist .
i did not set that fire .
even if that &apos;s true , rick ,
you have exhausted all your appeals .
i don &apos;t care about the courts . listen to me .
my son only knows me
as this selfish , lying , fall @-@ down drunk .
that &apos;s not who i am anymore .
i &apos;ll call him .
see if he &apos;d be willing to come by and say goodbye .
he won &apos;t . he doesn &apos;t want to hear from me .
after i got locked up ,
i wrote him a letter a week -- sometimes two .
he never responded .
about three years ago ,
the letters started coming back with no forwarding address .
listen to me , vince .
the only way my son will see me
is if he knows i did not set that fire ,
which i did not .
i swear it .
well , you seem like you &apos;ve gotten your act together in here .
sometimes , prison does that for people .
write another letter .
i &apos;ll find jason . i &apos;ll take it to him myself .
you were the smartest guy in the neighborhood ,
and you &apos;ve been a smart cop for a long time .
vince , all i &apos;m asking
is that you just take a look at my case .
give it two or three hours ,
and if you &apos;re not convinced , then just walk away .
don &apos;t give it another thought .
i &apos;ll take a look .
but no promise about what happens after that .
thank you .
she wanted to massage my feet .
well , that &apos;s very nice .
yes , when i was 3 .
now it &apos;s just a little weird .
you almost died . she &apos;s your mother .
she &apos;s just having some kind of a post @-@ traumatic response .
uh , come in .
sorry to bother you on a saturday night .
what a surprise . thank you .
barolo 2009 . what &apos;s the occasion ?
well , i &apos;ve been looking over a case from a while back ,
and i was hoping you &apos;d be willing
to look at yesterday &apos;s science through today &apos;s lens .
how old is old ?
wow . 15 years .
double homicide , arson .
rick sullivan . mm .
killed his wife and child .
did you get your medical @-@ release letter yet ?
no .
sorry .
oh , vince , come on .
the department rules are clear --
no department business
until you &apos;ve got a doctor &apos;s okay to return to duty .
it &apos;s a file that i &apos;m reading at hom--
no , someone else &apos;s home .
technically , it &apos;s department business .
you were in the drug unit 15 years ago .
this isn &apos;t even your case .
no . and i &apos;m annoyed at myself
for saying yes i would do it .
but it &apos;s hard to tell a dying man to buzz off ,
especially if you &apos;ve known him for 50 years .
you &apos;re a very good man , vince .
yes . and a bit of a hard @-@ ass
when it comes to some of your closest friends .
it &apos;s a day or two . you &apos;ll be fine .
i went through the files .
the d.a. had a pretty strong case against him .
rick was a broke alcoholic ,
and his wife had an insurance policy
worth 750,000 bucks .
the clincher ... is the arson report .
they found acetone on his pants .
it &apos;s the same accelerant that was used to start the fire .
when we were kids ,
rick would give you the shirt off his back .
he took a lot of hits
protecting his sisters from his dad .
if the science says he did it , he did it .
all i promised him was a fair look .
well , i guess we should get started .
and when i say &quot; we , &quot; of course , i mean the two of you
because i &apos;m not cleared for duty , so ...
good luck . good night .
sleep well .
i did not see that coming .
thanks for coming in on sunday .
no problem .
i just figure while maura &apos;s looking at the forensics ,
it wouldn &apos;t hurt to take another look at the shoe leather .
i was just sitting here for a minute .
like we talked about --
better than leaving it empty all the time .
well , the table was pretty packed anyway .
yeah , where &apos;d that come from ?
i brought up the archives in case we needed them .
did you know them well ?
i never even met the wife .
saw rick and his daughter in a park a couple times .
a cute kid .
so i &apos;ve been through the interviews with rick .
over five days , he never once changed his story .
he said he got drunk and blacked out like most nights ,
came to coughing up smoke in the yard .
the son , jason , was lucky that tree
was right outside his bedroom window .
i doubt it felt lucky at the time .
yeah . were you able to track him down ?
he &apos;s married with a baby . they live in dedham .
you gonna talk to him ?
not unless we find something .
the kid &apos;s been through enough .
if we don &apos;t get traction ,
we &apos;re gonna do this for one day . that &apos;s it .
we &apos;re not looking to overturn a conviction here --
just looking for doubt .
maura wants to talk to me .
well , i &apos;m all set here .
i &apos;ll let you know if i find anything .
all right , i was thinking about going over to rudy &apos;s
and picking up your favorite pastrami sandwich .
hello ?
i mean , i usually mention rudy &apos;s ,
and you &apos;re at the front door with car keys in your teeth .
what are you doing , ma ?
just wondering what &apos;s grabbed your attention .
i was just reading this fascinating article --
&quot; 10 ways to please my man
and make him happy as a clam ... with a candle . &quot;
well , that &apos;s a new one .
it &apos;s fascinating stuff .
the candle or the clam ?
i &apos;m sorry . what -- you were saying something before ?
i was gonna go to rudy &apos;s and pick us up some sandwiches .
oh , really ? yeah .
i -- that sounds great . i &apos;d love that .
all right . i &apos;ll be back in a bit .
thanks .
least i could do . so ?
so , i looked over everything .
the burn pattern and depth of charring indicate a fire
that burned unusually hot ,
so i took another look at the victims &apos; autopsies .
m.e. said they died of smoke inhalation .
well , in 1999 , that was the catchall term
used to describe inhalation @-@ type death ,
but five years ago , a study out of johns hopkins
demonstrated that some s.i. cases
are actually deaths from breathing superheated air .
how hot is superheated ?
it instantly sears your airways ,
causing death long before smoke and flame .
what does this mean for rick ?
the fire in the sullivan home was too hot
to be caused by acetone alone .
the arson unit determined that acetone
was the only fire accelerant ,
and the d.a. &apos; s case hinged on that point .
they were wrong .
i thought you &apos;d be more pleased .
oh , i &apos;m ...
i guess i was pretty sure i &apos;d be walking away from this .
well , my findings
do not absolutely exclude rick as a suspect .
no , but it &apos;s enough to make me glad
i didn &apos;t tell him i wouldn &apos;t help him .
thanks .
i &apos;m sure rick would say thank you if he could .
well , i &apos;m glad , but i &apos;m doing this for you .
i have confirmed these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date lists
on flash points and flame temperatures
for flammable chemicals .
great . i &apos;m ready to get started .
well , thank you for doing this on the weekend .
i really do need your expertise
to run this fire @-@ simulation program .
no problem . i &apos;d much rather be here
than at home being mad at myself
for not going sightseeing .
using the crime @-@ scene photos ,
i created a digital replica of the sullivan house ,
focusing on the hallway .
this is the simulation for 100 % acetone .
exactly as i expected .
the flame temperature doesn &apos;t rise above 390 degrees ,
and that &apos;s just not hot enough
to generate superheated smoke .
any thoughts on what it could be ?
let &apos;s try ether .
its flame temperature is high --
about 3,500 degrees .
that &apos;s too hot .
that would result in more charring
than what we saw in the crime @-@ scene photos .
there are no hardwood floors in their house .
it &apos;s all carpet and linoleum .
wait a minute .
it &apos;s not that the chemist didn &apos;t find the other accelerant .
it &apos;s that he misunderstood what it was .
i &apos;m sorry ... ?
the answer that we need --
it was in this report all along .
about korsak &apos;s case ...
how about &quot; hello . how are you ? &quot;
hello .
and about korsak &apos;s case ...
what do you know about it ?
frankie , there &apos;s no time for that . listen .
rick was a suspect
because he had two motives to kill his wife --
one , she was having an affair .
two , she had a life @-@ insurance policy .
okay .
well , motive was moved to the back burner
when they found acetone on his pants ,
which means that no one confirmed
who tanya &apos;s boyfriend was .
so he couldn &apos;t be eliminated as a suspect .
wait . how do you know any of this ?
you haven &apos;t been cleared -- - just find the boyfriend .
hey . hot pastrami .
oh , i could think of nothing else .
the original chemist tested 38 materials
inside the sullivan home --
drywall , door sills , fabric , foam , plastic --
are you gonna list all the materials he tested ?
yes .
this is usually when jane says , &quot; get to the point &quot;
before she &apos;s overcome with an urge to strangle me
with her bare hands .
i miss her .
the chemist found , uh , substantial amounts of acetone ,
as well as traces of other chemicals
that he discounted as burn @-@ off .
meaning the stuff left behind from everything that melted in the fire ?
yes . and one of those discounted chemicals
was toluene , a solvent .
but it would only have been present as a burn @-@ off
if the sullivans had hardwood floors .
which they didn &apos;t .
exactly .
so , the d.a. was wrong
about there being only one fire accelerant ,
which is why we need to retest rick &apos;s clothes
for the presence of toluene .
if you don &apos;t find any ,
how does that prove rick didn &apos;t set the fire ?
the acetone and toluene
had to have been poured from a single container .
otherwise , we would be seeing two burn patterns , not one .
so it would be impossible for rick to get splattered
with one chemical and not the other ?
and when we test his jeans , if there &apos;s no toluene ...
we have forensic proof that rick is innocent .
on a scale of 1 to 10,
how happy are you you didn &apos;t tell him to buzz off ?
homicide cases -- tanya sullivan and becky sullivan ?
right .
these aren &apos;t your cases , vince .
they &apos;re not even open .
i know .
just grab the files for me , will you ?
sure , just as soon as i get the okay
from the lead detective and the d.a.
two signatures , easy @-@ peasy .
that &apos;s bpd2410 and 2413 .
what ?
i need the files now .
oh , no . everything is time @-@ stamped .
once i get the forms ...
you will .
... and then you &apos;ll get the files .
a guy is dying in prison .
we &apos;re all dying , vince .
oh , come on , smitts .
do the right thing here .
i am . i &apos;m following the rules .
so forms and procedures and time stamps --
they &apos;re more important than justice ?
didn &apos;t say that .
yes , you did .
don &apos;t forget to wash it first .
but it says &quot; prewashed . &quot;
really ?
hello ?
evidence lockup won &apos;t play ball and give us the jeans .
we need the evidence to get the d.a. &apos; s permission .
but we need the d.a. &apos; s permission to get the evidence .
well , talk about a catch @-@ 22 .
smitts won &apos;t budge at all ?
oh , he doesn &apos;t know the meaning of the word .
i think he ate a rule book , and it got stuck in his colon .
that &apos;s not how digestion works .
i know , but you asked me to be more delicate when i say ,
&quot; that guy &apos;s got a rule book stuck up his ... &quot;
i got nothing .
well , there &apos;s got to be someone
who can go over this guy &apos;s head .
nobody &apos;s gonna put their ass on the line for a guy like rick .
so , after all this ,
it just comes down to a heartless bureaucracy ?
yeah , i @-@ i guess . i guess it does .
tanya sullivan had a boyfriend ?
uh , i mean , uh , if -- if she had a boyfriend ,
then that would be a new lead . am i right ?
&quot; if rick not guilty -- &quot;
that should say &quot; isn &apos;t guilty . &quot;
uh , &quot; the real arsonist had a motive . &quot;
the real arsonist had a motive .
you know what ? those are my good cloth napkins .
can &apos;t you just write on a piece of paper
like a normal person ?
you took files out of the box , didn &apos;t you ?
what do you mean ? what does he mean ?
not many .
i should be mad that you ignored department policy ,
but sometimes your blatant disregard for the rules
works to my advantage . tell me what you got .
apology accepted .
jane was right .
tanya sullivan got arrested a few weeks before the fire .
she was in an altercation in a bar ,
but the charges were dropped .
i tracked down every witness in the report .
anybody got a good memory ?
uh , one person remembered
tanya was with a guy who went by &quot; sal . &quot;
short for ... ?
salvador briglio .
he &apos;s 15 years older now ,
but the description the witness gave still matches .
how &apos;d you get him ?
uh , i just cross @-@ referenced variations of the name &quot; sal &quot;
with parking tickets issued near the bar
where tanya got arrested .
so he &apos;s a regular ?
five to six nights a week .
and he ran his mouth off a lot , too .
one person overheard sal warning tanya
to sleep with one eye open .
he said he was gonna kill her and her loser husband .
how long before the fire was that ?
uh , a few weeks .
it was probably a breakup fight .
tanya told him to get lost .
i &apos;ll bet he hated losing tanya to a drunk like rick .
well , the year of the fire ,
sal worked at a full @-@ service marina in falmouth .
guess which chemicals are used
in deck paint and boat maintenance .
acetone and toluene .
yep .
i think this could be our guy .
i was very impressed with your work yesterday .
oh , i just hit some computer keys .
you did the hard part .
i &apos;m sure thankful i don &apos;t wear that getup anymore .
polyester chafes like you wouldn &apos;t believe .
is it pure polyester ? not even a blend ?
pure .
detective rizzoli .
great to have you back at work .
oh , no , no , no . i &apos;m not back at work .
oh . well , you look fantastic anyway .
thank you , nina .
you look not like you at all .
yeah . what &apos;s the vibe you &apos;re getting ?
like ... stuffy , uptight , professional ?
wait a minute . that &apos;s -- that &apos;s my suit .
and what do you mean , &quot; stuffy &quot; ?
and that &apos;s my blouse .
well , i didn &apos;t think you would mind .
i &apos;ve never seen you wear this outfit .
well , because it isn &apos;t an outfit .
that blouse is eveningwear , and the suit is for work ,
which is why the skirt is knee @-@ length .
or , at least , it &apos;s supposed to be .
okay , jane , what &apos;s really going on here ?
what do you mean ?
why are you dressed like a flight attendant ?
first of all , i &apos;m dressed like a librarian .
i &apos;m wearing glasses on a chain , for god &apos;s sake .
have you ever checked out a book ?
well , have you ever been on a plane ?
because that scarf you &apos;re wearing screams ,
&quot; in the event of a water landing ,
your seat cushion can also be used as a floatation device . &quot;
that better ?
much .
good . i got to be 100 % librarian
if i &apos;m gonna pull this off .
pull what off ?
what just happened ?
i haven &apos;t heard the name tanya sullivan in years .
were you romantically involved with her ?
sure . i was involved with a lot of women back then .
tanya was arrested at a bar a few weeks before she died .
you know why ?
long time ago .
15 years . but a lot of people
still remember your fight with tanya that night .
what was it he said , again ?
&quot; i &apos;ll kill you .
i &apos;ll kill you both -- you and that loser . &quot;
and my personal favorite ,
&quot; sleep with one eye open , you bitch . &quot;
that &apos;s pretty vivid stuff , sal .
i was a hothead .
i said a lot of stupid stuff . i didn &apos;t mean it .
sounded pretty mad .
i treated tanya like a queen .
her husband treated her like garbage ,
but she cuts me loose so she can work on her marriage .
look where that got her .
yeah , let &apos;s look at where that got her .
she burned to death in the middle of the night
with her 7 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
did you know her kids were in the house ?
did you care ?
i didn &apos;t know because i didn &apos;t do this .
i wasn &apos;t even there .
yeah , where were you ?
on a fishing boat with four other guys ,
24 / 7 for a week .
names and numbers .
you know , i don &apos;t even know
why you &apos;re bothering with this , man .
excuse me ?
rick sullivan set that fire ,
and nobody who knew him has any doubt about that .
sit tight , sal .
uh , thanks .
his alibi &apos;s airtight .
he was 40 miles offshore -- the susan marie .
i &apos;m sorry .
you okay ?
we got a guy sitting in jail
for a crime we don &apos;t think he committed .
pretty far from okay .
thanks .
d.a. &apos; s at a fundraiser in cambridge .
why don &apos;t i talk to him ,
and you try and wrangle the other signature we need
to get the jeans released ?
why don &apos;t you just test them now ?
oh , i know . get it all out --
rules , policy , blah , blah , blah .
no , no , no , no , no .
right now , i &apos;m just so grateful that you &apos;re so stubborn
you don &apos;t care about getting fired .
i could get fired ?
department rule 110 , section 27 --
&quot; officers on medical leave . &quot;
you &apos;re learning a lot studying for that test .
this is -- this is just between us , right ?
how did you get smitts to give you the jeans ?
what -- you didn &apos;t see the wall calendar
with all the sexy women chewing on their glasses ?
last month was the librarian .
no ?
and you call yourselves detectives .
there is acetone on rick &apos;s jeans .
we knew that from the original test .
however , there are no other chemical signatures
that can connect him to the fire --
specifically , toluene .
well , if the acetone didn &apos;t get on rick
from starting the fire , where did it come from ?
i pulled up his medical records ,
and the night of the fire ,
rick was taken to the emergency room
and treated for nausea and stomach pains .
from smoke inhalation .
i thought so , too , until i read the lab results .
rick has a condition called alcoholic ketoacidosis .
can you take maalox for that ?
not quite .
heavy drinking caused his body
to produce an excess of acetone .
the only way for the body to rid itself of the acetone
is through urination . paragraph two .
&quot; the test sample contained a strong concentration
of acetone , uric acid , and ammonia . &quot;
urine ?
correct .
so the acetone on his pants isn &apos;t from starting a fire .
i can &apos;t wait to see the look on the d.a. &apos; s face
when i show him this -- that our proof
that rick sullivan didn &apos;t kill his family
is that he pissed his pants .
jason sullivan ?
sergeant detective korsak , boston homicide .
oh , my god . did something happen to my wife ? my son ?
no , no , no , no . they &apos;re fine .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to frighten you .
what &apos;s this about , then ?
your father .
i hope you &apos;ve come to tell me that he &apos;s dead .
no .
there &apos;s new evidence that could exonerate him .
is this new evidence
gonna bring back my mother and my sister ?
look , jason , i know that &apos;s a terrible loss ,
but it &apos;s not something i believe your father did .
just leave me alone , sergeant .
i know it &apos;s hard to take it in .
no , what &apos;s hard to take was having a father
who drank away his paycheck
and tried to kill his entire family .
you want me to believe he didn &apos;t do it ?
you show me the guy who did .
hey , ma .
hi . how come you &apos;re dressed like a ... flight attendant ?
librarian .
playing dress @-@ up -- it &apos;s kind of strange ,
but , you know , when you &apos;re bored and have nothing else --
i went to headquarters , ma .
i had to help out korsak .
you-- you really love your job , don &apos;t you ?
when are you gonna get it ?
i love what i do .
this came for you two days ago .
is that from the department doctor ?
yeah .
you hid this from me ?
i wasn &apos;t ready for you to go back .
well , that &apos;s not your decision , ma .
i know , and i @-@ i hate it .
i hate this whole thing .
i hate the fact that you have a job
where you can get hurt so easily .
i don &apos;t even know if i &apos;m cleared , so ...
i steamed it open .
no .
you can go back in two days .
yes ! ma ! thank you .
thank you .
yeah , wonderful news .
that &apos;s just wonderful .
oh , come on .
i &apos;m ready .
well , i &apos;m not , jane .
i fixed you up ,
and now you &apos;re gonna go back out there ,
and -- and i &apos;m gonna stay here and worry .
not tonight .
okay ?
come on . tonight , it &apos;s just --
it &apos;s just you and me , all right ?
and -- and we &apos;ll -- we &apos;ll watch a movie ,
and we &apos;ll sit here on the couch ,
and you can massage my feet if you want to ,
even though i hope you don &apos;t .
come on . what do you want to watch ?
i &apos;m gonna go make some grilled cheese .
i love you , ma .
well , you &apos;re only saying that
because you &apos;re getting your way .
do you understand what i just said ?
i might be able to convince the d.a.
to overturn the conviction .
did you talk to jason ?
yes .
what &apos;d he say ?
all right .
don &apos;t get me wrong , vince .
i &apos;d love to get out of here .
it &apos;s just that the only jury i care about is my son .
if he still thinks i &apos;m guilty , then i &apos;m guilty .
but i appreciate it . thank you .
you &apos;re a better man than i remember .
that was the d.a.
he &apos;ll reopen the case ?
if we come up with more than 15 @-@ year @-@ old jeans .
you come up with anything ?
i talked to a lot of people who didn &apos;t like rick .
bartenders , owner of the liquor store ,
a bunch of people he owed money to .
any of them look good for the arson ?
no , they &apos;re all regular people -- working stiffs .
none of them would have set fire to his house .
still , jane &apos;s right .
somebody had to have a motive to kill rick and his family .
i &apos;ll recanvass , talk to the neighbors .
maybe time loosened up a few tongues .
sorry , detective .
we didn &apos;t buy the house until after the fire .
yeah , in fact , the fire was a blessing of sorts .
you know a woman and her daughter died in that fire ?
that &apos;s not what my husband meant .
it &apos;s just that , well , we drove by the day after ,
just to check it out .
yeah .
to see if there was potential to rebuild
and maybe make a better offer than the insurance company ?
yes , but when we got here ,
we saw the sign in the window of the house next door .
yeah , no realtor -- just a number .
in fact , the seller didn &apos;t even negotiate .
just accepted our first offer over the phone .
the owner wanted to make a quick sale ?
yeah , i guess .
he never even showed up to the closing .
remember that ?
he just gave our lawyer a power of attorney .
do you remember that guy &apos;s name ?
melvin tuttle .
he &apos;s got a few felony assault and battery charges ,
but mostly drug stuff --
for cooking and selling crystal meth .
field interrogation / observation reports show
melvin was associating with a local biker gang --
the devil &apos;s scorpions .
sounds like a typical outlaw @-@ biker drug operation .
the scorpions supply the chemicals .
and melvin cooks the meth .
still it doesn &apos;t explain
why melvin sells his house
and takes off right after the fire ...
unless he was responsible for it in some way .
we &apos;ll never know .
six weeks after the fire ,
melvin tuttle was stabbed to death
in jacksonville , florida .
一男子在杰克逊维尔码头附近被刺身亡
melvin tuttle might have burned the house down ,
but why would he ?
i don &apos;t think he did .
i mean , come on . the guy takes off to florida .
he &apos;s dead six weeks later ?
i &apos;m betting he ran because somebody was after him .
how long until melvin &apos;s homicide file gets here ?
jacksonville &apos;s digging it out of cold cases .
said they &apos;d overnight it to us .
all right . well , we can keep working while we wait .
is it possible they were in business together ?
i could recheck the forensics and see if i can identify
any meth by @-@ products in the sullivan house .
we need to nail down a connection
between rick and melvin tuttle .
yeah , and figure out
why someone wanted them both dead .
i &apos;m gonna go back and work with frankie and nina .
i will see you tomorrow at bpd , detective .
see you tomorrow .
you got anything ?
uh , the drug unit has plenty on melvin tuttle .
nothing on rick sullivan .
what about phone records and incident reports ?
we &apos;re still checking .
there &apos;s nothing yet .
i didn &apos;t want to break the rules and show up early .
what have you two been doing ?
we &apos;re looking at old drug @-@ unit surveillance videos .
we &apos;ve pulled the ones where melvin was tagged .
we &apos;re looking for any sign that he and rick knew each other .
any luck ?
not so far .
okay , let &apos;s -- let &apos;s look at the next one .
this is three days before the fire .
that &apos;s the 1310 -- headquarters for the scorpions .
they are not too happy with melvin .
wait , wait . pause that .
is that rick &apos;s truck ?
nina , run a dmv check on rick sullivan .
dmv doesn &apos;t keep records that far back .
i &apos;ll check the department of revenue .
what ?
massachusetts charges a road tax
on all vehicles registered .
enjoy that when you buy a car .
well , rick drove a red chevy 1500 .
okay , that &apos;s a ford .
nina , pull up the exterior crime @-@ scene photo from the fire .
rick &apos;s red pickup truck in his driveway .
it &apos;s almost the same color as melvin &apos;s .
they live right next door to each other ,
and both own red pickup trucks .
so someone wanted melvin tuttle dead .
when they went to kill him , they burned down the wrong house .
ma , today should be an easy day .
yeah , you &apos;re just saying that for my sake .
no , no , i &apos;m not , really .
we &apos;re waiting on a homicide file from florida .
all i &apos;m gonna do today is -- is paperwork . that &apos;s it .
you ready , ma ?
i feel the same as i did on your first day of school --
sending you out into a world
where i can &apos;t be there to take care of you .
and i was fine that day ,
and i &apos;ll be fine today .
no , you came home missing a front tooth ,
fighting with that murphy boy .
well , he started it .
besides , that tooth was loose , anyway .
you could always take care of yourself , jane .
go ahead . go and knock &apos; em dead .
i &apos;m a homicide detective , ma .
they &apos;re already dead .
don &apos;t be a smartass .
all right .
that -- i can &apos;t move my arms . let me go .
i know .
i love you .
i love you , too .
i &apos;ll see you later .
hey , janie .
good to have you back ... officially .
yeah , we missed you .
i missed you guys .
oh , it &apos;s good to be back .
okay , um , did that file come in from jacksonville ?
two motorcycles were seen leaving the area of the tuttle murder .
witness saw a gold stripe on the gas tank
and cowboy @-@ style saddlebags on one .
no description of the other bike .
and i found this in the organized crime unit files .
what are the chances
that two motorcycles look just like that ?
it depends .
are we going to the gold @-@ stripe and saddlebag store ?
henry &quot; blade &quot; vallenhurst .
oh , he was president of the devil &apos;s scorpions .
i doubt burning down the wrong house
would stop him from killing melvin .
jacksonville homicide said there were two motorcycles .
he had an accomplice .
so , the question is , who did he trust enough
to help him kill melvin tuttle ?
florida is coming for you , blade ...
... for the murder of melvin tuttle .
you &apos;re talking out your ass .
well , my ass found two collect calls that you made
from a motel in jacksonville
the same night that melvin was murdered .
we sent your photo down to the locals .
one person identified you .
he even remembered your scorpion tattoo .
we know you didn &apos;t do it alone ,
so further research turned over another collect call ,
uh , from the same room , same date ... from this guy .
robert kincade , fellow scorpion .
he &apos;s doing 10 years in walpole on a drug beat
because he turned down an offer to testify against you .
and he won &apos;t say anything now .
we thought the same thing .
however , we managed to convince him
what a solid case florida had against him ,
and it seems like your pal kincade
can &apos;t really stomach the idea of 2,200 volts of electricity
popping his eyeballs out of his head .
so i made him an offer -- his life for yours .
now , here &apos;s the thing .
i don &apos;t really care about melvin or kincade .
i care about the fire that killed tanya and becky sullivan .
so you own up to what you did .
you confess to setting the sullivan house on fire .
you &apos;re not following . okay .
and as much as i hate it ,
florida can &apos;t execute you
if you &apos;re doing life here .
that damn red truck .
what were the odds ?
yeah , what were the odds ?
you just have to walk me through what happened .
my father &apos;s innocent ?
he &apos;s been telling the truth .
the d.a. filed a motion to overturn the verdict .
what does that mean ?
that means in two days , your father will be a free man .
okay .
cheers .
so , is my mother boycotting my big send @-@ off ?
no , she actually went out dancing .
but she sends her love .
i &apos;m sorry . did you say she went dancing ?
i did . she is .
hold on .
where ? w @-@ with who ?
she didn &apos;t say .
you didn &apos;t ask ?
well , angela is a grown woman .
yes , but she can &apos;t be out clubbing
in the middle of the night .
it &apos;s 9 : 30 .
oh , maura , don &apos;t hassle me with the details .
my mother is missing .
okay .
i know that it &apos;s scary ,
but angela has to leave the nest and spread her wings .
that &apos;s good advice ...
if we were talking about a cockatoo , which we are not .
my mother has dated two men her entire life ,
both of whom i knew very well .
she doesn &apos;t know what men are like .
what if she leaves her drink unattended ,
and somebody puts something in it ?
i think we all know how that turns out , don &apos;t we ?
i can &apos;t believe you would bring that up .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re not concerned about my mother .
do i need to pull up your booking photo ?
i think we both know that your mother is okay .
yeah .
so you &apos;re just gonna wait up for her ?
well , i can &apos;t sleep now .
well , i was going to give you a goodbye present
when you left tonight , but apparently ...
you got me luggage .
they &apos;re made with three @-@ ply durable plastic ,
and they even have a ziplock and handles .
it &apos;s perfect .
i was gonna get you a stick
with a bandana on the end of it ,
but then i thought that was too hobo @-@ chic .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
so , should we order a pizza ?
we might be waiting up for a while .
well , you don &apos;t have to . i &apos;m sure you &apos;re exhausted .
no , i @-@ i doubt i could sleep either .
what time is it now ?
9 : 36 .
what time do we start calling hospitals ?
not until later -- after 10 : 00 .
10 : 05 .
raising my mother &apos;s a lot harder than i thought .
