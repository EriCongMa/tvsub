you guys seriously think mona &apos;s body is in that barrel ?
yes . that storage unit
was rented in hannah &apos;s name 4 months ago .
three acceptance letters . aren &apos;t you gonna open them ?
when i made that comment about ezra being cute--
yeah . i said it because i &apos;m interested in you .
looks like they recorded every one of her sessions .
wait , are we stealing this stuff ?
we &apos;re borrowing it .
what are you saying ?
if we stay together ,
you might grow to resent me .
why would you tell toby about the storage unit ?
i didn &apos;t .
well , then how come he and tanner showed up there today ?
because holbrook broke into your computer , hanna .
he knew that you were going to the storage unit .
you screwed yourself by going in there ..
if those drops of blood match her dna ,
your friends will be the first people
i bring in for a questioning .
what was in the barrel ?
i can &apos;t talk about it .
can toby tell you if it was human remains in that drum ?
they don &apos;t know .
but even if he did , he probably wouldn &apos;t tell me .
are you guys okay ?
we are some distance removed from okay .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know why he joined the police force .
i encouraged him .
he &apos;s the most honorable person that i know
and it &apos;s like now this is tearing him apart .
i &apos;m tearing him apart .
is that your mom ?
yeah , that &apos;s her .
lawyers working on a saturday , that &apos;s serious .
my mom says you get more with a smile
than with a subpoena .
what is she trying to get from them ?
those two are ali &apos;s defense team .
my mom is a paid strategical consultant .
your mom &apos;s helping ali &apos;s defense ?
no , not helping , just consulting .
she &apos;ll get more out of them
than they will out of her .
okay , but why is she even doing it at all ?
because she wants to know what they know .
such as ?
such as who gets called to testify .
yeah .
wish you luck .
luck .
luck .
ezra in there ?
no . he &apos;s in harrisburg for the weekend .
you didn &apos;t know ?
no , i knew . i just forgot .
you forgot ? or he forgot to tell you ?
i forgot .
just give me 2 minutes , please . i have to try to fix this .
there &apos;s nothing to fix .
don &apos;t say that .
spence , you were right .
i was ?
yeah . i thought about it .
and i thought about it in the tub for so long ,
my fingers started to look like prunes .
it was a bad idea ,
trying to get that stuff out of the storage space .
i panicked .
panic &apos;s a bitch .
i just hope i didn &apos;t make things incredibly worse .
you &apos;re not pruney anymore .
i moisturized .
are we good ?
we &apos;re good .
maybe not so good .
oh , my god , it &apos;s holbrook .
so much for family emergencies and special assignments .
what is holbrook doing back here after all this time ?
ali probably wants him torturing us in close range .
forget about torturing ,
she wants to take us down with her .
he was doing such a good job .
why bring him out in the open ?
spence ?
why bring holbrook out in the open like that ?
so we know he &apos;s here ,
to scare us without doing anything .
it &apos;s pretty passive aggressive ,
and &quot; a &quot; is aggressive aggressive .
well , ali probably wants people inside that building
for the same reason your mom
is making chummy with ali &apos;s lawyers .
inside information .
i &apos;ll be right back .
guys , ali is going to be tried
and she is going to be convicted .
the closer we get to the trial ,
the more desperate she &apos;s going to get .
and the more dangerous .
it &apos;s caleb .
you moving in ?
no , i &apos;m still at the barn .
so what &apos;s all this then ?
ezra liked what i did for the opening .
so he asked me what else i could come up with .
i told him i &apos;d give him something no one else had .
a commission ?
a $ 200 commission .
what &apos;s it going to be ?
the only way to find out is for you to help me build it .
really ? i &apos;m kind of busy .
i don &apos;t have any time right now .
oh , i guess you &apos;ll never know what it does .
spencer , we have to talk .
okay .
hello .
good morning .
are you feeling better ?
better ?
um , ezra left a note saying you called in yesterday .
oh . i wasn &apos;t sick .
i just had to take care of something .
the police called caleb .
they want to re @-@ interview him about the storage space ,
asking if he saw anyone there acting suspicious .
aside from you ?
aria , you &apos;re not helping .
okay ? they &apos;re going to call me next . i know it .
they &apos;re just trying to make you nervous .
well , it &apos;s working .
you better answer it .
thanks .
hey , what can i get for you ?
actually , i &apos;m looking for someone .
hanna marin ?
why are you looking for hanna marin ?
mrs. vanderwaal said i might find her here .
my name is lesli . i was a friend of mona &apos;s .
i &apos;m still having really hard time
believing what happened .
so are we .
i was supposed to see her at thanksgiving .
i was there , with her mom , when they called .
they didn &apos;t say she was dead .
they &apos;re not allowed to tell you that over the phone .
they just said that something had happened
and she had to come back to rosewood .
did you know mona a long time ?
we met a couple of summers ago , at her grandparents &apos; place .
i don &apos;t remember seeing you at the memorial service .
i had exams
and a professor who won &apos;t reschedule
for anyone or anything .
but you &apos;re here now .
just for the weekend .
with that awful girl &apos;s trial coming up ,
mrs. vanderwaal needs all the support she can get .
you girls were there for mona and her mom , and i wasn &apos;t .
i want to thank you for that .
whoever lesli is , we need to keep an eye on her .
you don &apos;t suppose she could be who she says she is , do you ?
sure . she could be .
but the last time somebody &apos;s old friend came up to us
in the brew it was cece .
just go over there and say hi to mona &apos;s mom .
spencer , i &apos;m at the police station .
can &apos;t you feel the police vibrations
coming at you through the phone ?
okay , but when you leave the police station ,
just go talk to lesli .
just make sure that she does most of the talking .
hanna , i really got to go , okay ? but you &apos;re gonna be fine .
okay .
mom ?
hi , mom .
spencer .
i saw you talking to holbrook today .
yes , he &apos;s back .
that special assignment all done ?
i wouldn &apos;t worry about holbrook .
why not ?
you and i have something else to discuss .
where did you get those ?
these are acceptance letters from colleges
i didn &apos;t even know you were considering .
how do you know that they &apos;re acceptance letters , mom ?
i never even opened them .
they reject you with a one @-@ page letter .
saying &quot; yes &quot; requires more paperwork .
i don &apos;t-- i just applied so that i would have more options
and then i changed my mind .
about what ?
spencer , we have to stay focused .
you are going to go to college .
i &apos;m starting to think maybe
it wouldn &apos;t be the worst thing in the world if i didn &apos;t .
sweetheart , you have been thinking about college
since the first grade .
and maybe i should have been thinking about something else .
you have to keep your future properly aligned .
then i &apos;ll go to a chiropractor .
i am doing everything possible to keep you
from getting dragged into alison &apos;s trial .
you staying on course with college is part of that .
have i made myself clear ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
my mom &apos;s gonna be here in a couple of minutes .
how is your mom ?
she &apos;s got a lot going on .
she doesn &apos;t need this .
do you think she &apos;s going to marry ted ?
doesn &apos;t matter what i think .
it matters what she wants .
caleb , i had a bad thought .
you know that video of me and you
that &quot; a &quot; used to trap spencer and aria ,
what if the cops get a hold of it ?
well , we &apos;ll burn that bridge when we come to it .
at least it won &apos;t happen again .
i &apos;ve locked out remote access to all of our computers .
nobody can tap those cameras again .
hanna , there &apos;s nothing connecting us
to that busted lock besides bad timing ,
and they can &apos;t arrest you for that .
not yet .
this department has screwed up
the investigation from the start .
and now you &apos;re trying to blame it on me ?
you have no idea what &apos;s really going on here , do you ?
not a clue !
perfect .
just perfect .
my mom is giving strategic advice to ali &apos;s defense team
and they &apos;re sharing all kinds of information
with her about the case ,
which includes who &apos;s been visiting ali in jail .
there &apos;s a copy of the visitors &apos; log @-@ in .
i took a picture .
is hanna &apos;s name on the list ?
yeah , but that &apos;s not the name that &apos;s worrying me .
n @-@ what ?
no , that @-@ that &apos;s gotta be a mistake .
how many mike montgomerys do we know ?
even if that is true , he must have had a good reason .
i mean , alison killed his girlfriend .
he was probably just , i don &apos;t know ,
going there to spit in her eye .
maybe .
but then why didn &apos;t he mention he was doing it ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but there &apos;s got to be a good explanation .
if there is an explanation ,
you &apos;re the only one in a place to get it .
they suspended holbrook ?
for inappropriate behavior .
what kind of inappropriate behavior ?
take your pick .
noodling with a witness ?
letting cyrus get away ?
caleb heard the cops talking about
how holbrook tampered with the lie detector test .
and that was the straw that broke the chameleon &apos;s back .
well , if the cops are onto him ,
that &apos;s one less thing we have to worry about .
you wouldn &apos;t say that if you saw the way he looked at me .
ali may have been leading him around by the nose ,
but i think he blames us for what happened to him .
yeah , i wish it didn &apos;t ,
but that makes an awful lot of sense .
hey , you know what ?
call aria and spencer .
i have to go keep an eye on the new girl in town .
okay .
little girl !
little girl !
what &apos;s this ?
mona had this list of movies she wanted to show me .
i thought i &apos;d look at a couple .
how &apos;s that going ?
okay , i guess .
it was a long time before i could even look at her list ,
and here i am .
yeah , mona liked her movies .
yeah .
i think she remembered every movie she ever saw .
not just the plot , but details-- all these little details .
it was amazing .
she was very smart .
too smart .
honey .
what &apos;s your name ?
who do you belong to ?
she told me about this book .
she said her grandfather got it for her
and he &apos;d read to her from it and scare the hell out of her .
mrs. vanderwaal said that you were trying to find me .
not just you , the others .
why ?
that &apos;s a funny question .
you were friends of mona &apos;s .
well , lesli , if you really knew mona well ,
you would know that what was between all of us
was a lot more complicated than going to the mall
and tweeting photos of shoes that we wanted .
i know .
but in spite of all that , she really cared about you .
you were all very precious to mona .
you do realize there is more than
one mona inside of her , right ?
that &apos;s what i liked about her .
most girls have trouble keeping
two thoughts in their mind at the same time ,
but mona was thinking every second .
&quot; and though my heart be broken here is a ring as a token
that i am happy now .
would god i could awaken .
for i dream , i know not how .
and my soul is sorely shaken .
lest the dead who is forsaken may not be happy now . &quot;
why do you like this stuff ?
i love this stuff .
it &apos;s like maple syrup , all sticky and sweet .
and creepy .
it &apos;s the creepy part that makes it fun .
okay , you &apos;ve got three wishes
what do you want ? and you can &apos;t wish for more wishes .
i don &apos;t like wishing games .
they just remind you of what you don &apos;t have .
oh , you are such a thud .
what &apos;s the point of breaking your shell
if you turn into such a dull omelet ?
you make better wishes anyway .
that &apos;s true .
i would wish for a stopwatch .
a stopwatch ?
so when you press down on the stem ,
not only does the watch stop , but all time stops .
everything freezes and you can walk around
and take anything you want from the stores
and go into people &apos;s houses ,
even when they &apos;re there and spy on them .
you would have all the control
and nobody would ever know it was you .
they wouldn &apos;t even know they were being controlled .
that &apos;d be the best part .
mona was always thinking .
she just wasn &apos;t thinking
what we thought she was thinking .
thanks .
don &apos;t mention it .
hey , man .
what &apos;s that going to be ?
it &apos;s like a perpetual motion machine ,
powered by secrets .
there &apos;s plenty of those around here .
and so i &apos;ve noticed .
hi , mike .
lesli , this is mike , aria &apos;s brother .
oh , mike , it &apos;s so nice to meet you .
mona talked about you all the time .
she &apos;s staying with mrs. vanderwaal .
i can see that .
you can ?
that belongs to mona .
i know . we were just looking at it in her room .
in her room ?
i know it sounds silly ,
i just wanted it with me for a little while .
does her mom know you took that ?
mike , it &apos;s not like we took it .
is her mom giving away her stuff now ? is that what &apos;s happening ?
no , that &apos;s not what &apos;s happening .
then give me the book .
mike !
i &apos;m taking it back to where it belongs .
it &apos;s okay .
no , hanna , it &apos;s not okay .
you can &apos;t take everything apart
like you want her to disappear .
hand it over .
mike , i &apos;ll make sure the book goes back to where it belongs .
okay ? i promise .
i &apos;m sorry .
mike and mona were pretty serious before it all happened .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i don &apos;t want to make trouble for anyone .
the night before mona was killed ,
we were talking on the phone
and in the middle of it , someone came up to her
and told her to hang up and talk to him .
he sounded pretty upset .
i &apos;m pretty sure it was mike .
she said she would call me back , but she never did .
did anybody tell you it &apos;s saturday ?
well , i got to work on my academic cred .
because of hanna ?
she keeps surprising you , doesn &apos;t she ?
all those hidden smarts .
i don &apos;t want to get left in the dust .
though i should probably be focusing on criminal law .
is it going to make a difference now that holbrook is suspended ?
maybe .
someone like that can cause a lot of trouble
from the sidelines , too .
how &apos;s the new situation going ?
still very new .
what &apos;s up ?
ali &apos;s going on trial for murder .
she &apos;s trying to bring us all down with her ,
and i keep trying to figure out
if a girl is flirting with me or not .
well , in the middle of the war ,
you have to remember what you &apos;re fighting for .
what answer do you want to hear ?
flirting or non @-@ flirting ?
i don &apos;t know what i want .
i mean , i know what i want .
i just don &apos;t know what i want .
scary thing is , that makes perfect sense to me .
how does anybody get together with anybody ?
well , you take a calm , clear look at everything
and you work it out logically in your head .
and then , you flip a coin .
you believe what she said ?
lesli did talk to mona .
i asked mrs. v.
she said mona mentioned the call .
but it probably doesn &apos;t mean anything .
he &apos;s just sad and angry .
hanna .
mike went to visit alison in jail .
he did what ?
spencer found out .
mike got in a fight with mona the night before she died
and now he &apos;s going to visit the person who killed her ?
well , it sounds really bad when you say it like that .
well , have you talked to him ?
i tried .
but i don &apos;t know ,
i couldn &apos;t get the words out of my mouth .
even if you can &apos;t talk to him ,
you have to figure out what &apos;s going on .
pliers .
are you gonna tell me what this thing does ?
you &apos;re smart , you can figure it out .
i don &apos;t want to figure it out . i just want to know .
analyze that sentence , spencer , it &apos;s very revealing .
it &apos;s a gelato maker .
that &apos;s right , that &apos;s what it is .
shut up .
艾莉森 · 迪劳伦提斯
where did you get this ?
in the barn .
there are still a couple of those around town .
you see them on old telephone poles
with the missing dog and cat flyers .
they &apos;re a little faded , but you can tell what they are .
your friend is just about mythic in this town .
she &apos;s not my friend anymore .
she &apos;s still legendary .
gilgamesh in high heels .
she &apos;s more like a vishnu .
&quot; now i am become death , the destroyer of worlds . &quot;
some grim stuff to hang on a pretty girl with a nice smile .
how do you go from that
to sitting in jail for killing someone ?
it &apos;s complicated .
or else it &apos;s simple and we just thought that it was complicated .
phillips @-@ head screwdriver , please .
here .
maybe you shouldn &apos;t have told aria about mike .
he &apos;s her brother , she deserves to know .
i just don &apos;t want to get him into any trouble .
mike will be fine . he &apos;s a good guy .
i hope so .
i &apos;m going to help mrs. vanderwaal with her tea .
okay , i &apos;m right behind you .
the stop watch .
all the time it was stopped , you &apos;d be getting older ,
but nobody else would .
i &apos;d fix that .
well , how would you fix it ?
fix it so everyone else would get old , but not me .
well , when they notice that you weren &apos;t getting older ?
that would be their problem .
suppose alison came back a long time from now ,
will we recognize her ?
we &apos;d recognize her .
what if she changed her hair and the way she looked ?
what if she wanted to
come back in disguise just to check up on us ?
even if she did come back , she wouldn &apos;t recognize us .
she &apos;d come back to a town full of strangers
who &apos;d have forgotten all about her .
and then she &apos;d go crazy and they &apos;d throw her into radley ,
and no one ever gets out of there .
god , mona , don &apos;t say that .
it &apos;s just another scary story , hanna .
like in the book .
just a story .
go to sleep .
what do you think ?
is it finished ?
of course it is .
you can &apos;t tell ?
that &apos;s a very sour look .
be careful , your face might freeze like that .
will you finally tell me what this thing does ?
sit down .
you see these two buttons ?
put your elbows on them , lean forward .
now cup your hands around your ears .
you &apos;re kidding .
i never kid .
i &apos;m whimsical , but i never kid .
stay there .
this is ridiculous .
the owl and the pussy @-@ cat went to sea
in a beautiful pea @-@ green boat .
the microphone is attached
to a pair of sound drivers in the table ,
like the inside of a speaker .
whenever you rest your elbows on the buttons ,
the drivers vibrate the ulna and the radius in each arm
and the bones in your hands , turning them into headphones .
you just became a human tuning fork .
oh , my god .
what do you think ?
it &apos;s not bad for $ 200 , right ?
that &apos;s incredible !
people turn on the microphone
and anonymously record any secret they want to
with the understanding that someone ,
a stranger , is going to sit at this table
and listen to a random whisper .
this is brilliant .
seriously , this is-- this is genius .
just some anatomy and applied engineering--
jonny .
yeah , come to think of it , it is genius .
yeah .
where did you come up with this idea ?
i was inspired by rosewood .
by rosewood ?
this whole town is strung together with whispers .
if you were really impressed , you &apos;d buy me coffee .
i thought you said that alison cleared
all the radley material from mona &apos;s house .
that &apos;s what we thought . but she hid this one .
she didn &apos;t keep it with the others .
well , let &apos;s find out why .
she &apos;s a bitch .
let &apos;s try to find other words .
she &apos;s an evil bitch .
bethany .
i don &apos;t mean nasty or rude .
i mean evil , without a soul .
you could be the nicest person in the world--
she gets them to do whatever she wants .
five minutes with her you &apos;d drown a bag of kittens if she asked .
two minutes , if you &apos;re a man .
if you &apos;re having destructive thoughts ...
not destructive , self @-@ defense .
it &apos;s me or her . she &apos;s not the only one who can make plans .
what the hell was that ?
that was bethany .
and she &apos;s talking about alison , right ?
let &apos;s listen to the whole thing .
nice night .
yeah , it &apos;s getting kind of chilly though .
why &apos;d you follow me out here ?
why did you visit alison in jail ?
you did , didn &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s none of your business .
did you want to confront her about mona ?
were you looking for some kind of closure ?
ali &apos;s dangerous , mike .
even in a cage , she &apos;s really dangerous .
don &apos;t ever go back there again .
nobody is giving me orders anymore .
you stop following me .
i don &apos;t ever want to see you out here again .
&quot; again ? &quot;
how many times have you been out here ?
how many trick @-@ or @-@ treat bags have you left ?
who are you leaving those for ?
be careful going home through the woods .
why are you working in here ?
you could just use the den .
that was your father &apos;s space .
i don &apos;t feel comfortable working in there .
where were you ?
um , i was just helping out jonny at the brew .
i &apos;m starting to have second thoughts about him .
don &apos;t . i really like the way his mind works .
i hate to see young people
like that squander their potential .
i don &apos;t really think jonny sees it that way .
talking to him , is that what
has you thinking about not going to college ?
mom ,
i &apos;m not not thinking about going to college , okay ?
i &apos;m just thinking .
spencer , your future won &apos;t wait .
do you remember what you wanted to do
with your life when you were my age ?
and don &apos;t say , &quot; be a lawyer . &quot;
i did not want to be a lawyer .
then please , just do me a favor
and try for , like , 10 seconds ,
just try to remember what that felt like .
yes , ralph .
spencer , wait .
yeah . it &apos;ll have an impact .
i just don &apos;t know what .
okay .
thank you .
there &apos;s been a leak from the prosecutor &apos;s office .
what kind of leak ?
they &apos;re still analyzing the contents of the barrel
from the storage space ,
but they have a match on the blood spots .
mona &apos;s blood ?
no .
alison &apos;s .
hello , hanna .
they suspended you .
why do you have this car ?
i haven &apos;t gotten around to turning it in .
you &apos;re gonna report me ?
i might get in trouble for that .
let go of me . now !
i just want to ask you a question first .
how does a girl like alison become a girl like alison ?
she &apos;s had years of practice .
i had a career .
the start of one .
i don &apos;t have that anymore .
i &apos;m finished because of her .
you could have said no .
you didn &apos;t have to do all of her dirty work ,
cleaning out all that junk in the storage space ,
trying to kill spencer , aria and caleb .
no , you &apos;re getting me mixed up with the wrong fall guy .
i spent the last few weeks locked up in a hotel
with a couple of old @-@ timers from internal affairs .
you don &apos;t believe me ?
ask tanner .
tanner knows everything .
wait a minute .
she cut me off .
when ?
did alison tell you to kiss me ?
oh , she did , didn &apos;t she ?
you don &apos;t get to play the victim here .
you &apos;re the grown @-@ up police officer . she &apos;s just a girl .
if ali really did cut you off , congratulations .
you don &apos;t know how lucky you are .
i thought you left .
i was just looking at this .
do you know what it &apos;s supposed to do ?
jonny said it was about catching whispers .
i wonder how it works .
he told me .
i can show you ?
yes .
okay . sit down .
put your elbows here .
lean forward and cup your ears with your hands .
okay , stay like that .
it works like this .
i say something in here ...
and it travels up the bones in your arms
and into your ears .
like i was right next to you , whispering .
i should have said something that night , but i didn &apos;t .
i guess i was surprised .
i &apos;ve been thinking about it i ever since ,
about what you said .
it &apos;s like you were asking me to decide something right then
and i couldn &apos;t do that .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything about me , really .
and i don &apos;t know anything about you .
except , i know you &apos;re good at what you do .
really gifted .
i know that sometimes that makes things lonely .
i know what that &apos;s like .
to be alone .
to be lonely .
maybe i read too much of these situations
and what people say .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think you &apos;re
a very good judge of a situation .
so the other night ...
the other night , it took all the courage i had
to say what i said .
i don &apos;t believe that .
a chef once told me
to cook with the confidence of experience ,
even if you don &apos;t have much of either .
it &apos;s late .
where &apos;s emily ?
i don &apos;t know . her phone &apos;s still going straight to voicemail .
are you sure about this ?
you guys , holbrook doesn &apos;t know
half the stuff we thought he did .
we &apos;ve been barking up the wrong henchman .
so somebody else has been helping ali .
yes , somebody we don &apos;t know .
or somebody we &apos;d never suspect .
aria , we all know what ali &apos;s capable of .
yeah , okay , and i know my own brother .
he went to see her in jail and he won &apos;t tell you why .
and what if he goes back ?
what if he &apos;s the way that she &apos;s still moving stuff around ?
he &apos;s not gonna go back .
how can you be sure ?
because i told him not to .
the stuff that bethany was saying on the tape
about other people making plans , what does that mean ?
it means that what happened in ali &apos;s backyard was a trap .
okay , but who set the trap for who ?
she &apos;s a bitch .
let &apos;s try to find other words .
she &apos;s an evil bitch .
bethany .
i don &apos;t mean nasty or rude .
i mean evil , without a soul .
you could be the nicest person in the world--
she gets them to do whatever she wants .
five minutes with her , you &apos;d drown a bag of kittens if she asked .
two minutes , if you &apos;re a man .
if you &apos;re having destructive thoughts ...
not destructive , self @-@ defense .
