this is court @-@ ordered mediation .
it &apos;s not opt @-@ out mediation
or i @-@ don &apos;t @-@ feel @-@ like @-@ it mediation .
we know that , but what can we do ?
we can &apos;t negotiate with a stone .
yes , but you can lower your ask .
given the set of facts i &apos;m looking at ,
well , it &apos;s way to high .
and the law is far from clear as to ...
then let &apos;s go to court .
look , the judge doesn &apos;t want to clutter up his docket .
that &apos;s why he empowered me to keep you here
as long as i want to reach a compromise .
and i will .
so show me some movement .
our client wanted to sue for $ 38 million in punitive .
we got her down to 14 .
that is movement .
but where is theirs ?
think about a new ask .
i need you to raise your offer .
oh , come on .
given the set of facts i &apos;m looking at ,
well , it &apos;s way too low .
and the legal issues ...
what about their ask ?
$ 12 million for what was clearly an accident ?
$ 14 million .
oh , my god . it keeps going up .
no , it was always $ 14 million .
exactly , because they won &apos;t move .
that &apos;s will gardner &apos;s m.o.
he gets his opposition negotiating with themselves
so he can just sit back and ...
okay , the good news is ,
they &apos;ve agreed to an increase in their offer .
really ?
yes-- $ 100,000 .
as a goodwill gesture .
but it &apos;s linked to an equivalent reduction in your ask .
we &apos;re not meeting in the middle .
you are meetig in the middle .
everyone &apos;s meeting in the middle , or i keep you here .
this was an unfortunate accident ...
wait a minute .
i know celeste works under the mistaken impression
that if she says something enough times ,
it &apos;ll make it true ,
but this wasn &apos;t an accident ; this was fraud .
deposition 101 , page 58 .
&quot; but wasn &apos;t this an accident , ma &apos;am ? &quot; answer ...
no , an accident is unintentional .
what your client did to me was intentional .
you sound angry , ma &apos;am .
do i ?
i guss i am . i ...
would you like to take a break , maggie ?
can we get you anything for your pain ?
thank you , mr. gardner .
why don &apos;t we let maggie raise her hand when she wants to take a break
instead of continually vocalizing her pain into the record ?
wow , celeste . cynical much ?
only since your fifth interruption .
thank you ,
but i don &apos;t need a break .
she doesn &apos;t need a break , will .
can i continue now ?
it &apos;s up to you .
this was all caused by an accident four years ago , wasn &apos;t it ?
i was in a car accident .
it caused ddd-- degenerative disc disorder .
it &apos;s misaligned vertebrae discs .
and dr. farland , the man you are suing , my client ,
suggested an operation .
he did .
he said i needed an scs-- a spinal cord stimulator .
a device like this ?
our client was given a chance to choose
which model to have surgically implanted
from a catalogue of 12 fda @-@ approved models .
but she didn &apos;t choose any-- that &apos;s the defense &apos;s point .
yes , but i expected him
to pick one of the fda @-@ approved devices .
i was never told there was another option .
and what happened after the operation , maggie ?
the pain was gone .
i was ready to worship dr. farland .
but then the pain came back ?
yes , it was like a deal with the devil .
it came back three times worse .
but that &apos;s not why you brought suit .
no . about a month after my operation ,
i received an itemized bill for the scs .
on it was listed the manufacturer and the inventor .
and who was the inventor ?
my doctor , dr. farland .
and this device he invented--
it was not fda @-@ approved ?
that &apos;s right .
he just implanted it in me like i was a guinea pig .
i want to sympathize--
i do-- but you can &apos;t keep asking for $ 14 million .
maggie has three children .
she is in constant pain .
her life has been shortened by a decade .
her husband left her ,
and she &apos;s being kicked out of her house ,
all because she can not hold down a job
or offer spousal companionship .
now , if that happened to me
from a doctor who experimented on me without my knowledge ,
i &apos;m sorry , but i would be asking for twice as much .
good job . keep on him .
and , everyone , the mediator &apos;s threatening
to keep us here through the weekend ,
and i think he means it , so make arrangements .
we might have a slight edge in mediation .
the mediator seems sympathetic .
really ? will that matter ?
not really .
we &apos;re heading to trial either way ,
but it shows our argument &apos;s working .
what &apos;s up there ?
i just got a call .
someone who needs crisis management .
one of our clients ?
no , someone impressed with the florrick rehabilitation .
now i &apos;m starting to feel like a slacker .
eli is starting to clock more billable hours than us .
who is it , one of the airlines ?
i heard a jet went off the runway at o &apos;hare .
no , but i might be able to sign them .
i can decide for both of us ?
yes . just keep me in the loop .
cheese .
cheese ?
yes . we represent the wisconsin state dairy guild ,
and we need your help .
with cheese ?
yes .
a certain kind of cheese or all cheese ?
there was an outbreak of listeriosis
in a chicago grammar school four hours ago .
news reports say the outbreak
was traced to bacterial @-@ infected cheese slices .
five children are hospitalized ,
four teachers are ill ,
and we &apos;re getting alarmed calls from government officials .
patrick ! lydia !
does the guild have a contract with an existing pr firm ?
keyser &amp; associates .
they &apos;re working on an &quot; eat cheese &quot; campaign .
not anymore . you hire me , i am one voice .
tell me that &apos;s ok , we &apos;re going forward .
i &apos;ll have to get permission .
that &apos;s fine for now ,
but i need someone here who doesn &apos;t need to get permission .
monthly retainer of $ 60,000 a month .
hourly still applies . you &apos;ll find that &apos;s competitive .
fine .
get me everything on listeriosis ,
anyone who will speak out against cheese .
and i &apos;ll need more investigator time . get kalinda .
she &apos;s on the mediation .
not anymore .
60 ... 60 a month ...
w @-@ wait , hold on .
... may also be tainted .
it was just after recess .
the culprit-- the most innocent of foods .
cheese .
this cell phone video ,
oh , dear god .
shot by a cafeteria worker ,
captures several students becoming gravely ill ...
we &apos;re worried this is gonna keep people from purchasing cheese .
you think ?
cheeseburgers and grilled cheese sandwiches ...
you &apos;ll have to hire lockhart / gardner
as temporary counsel .
actually , we have outside counsel .
okay , i can explain myself for now ,
but when things move faster ,
you &apos;re going to have to just trust me .
currently , everything we say and do can be subpoenaed
for civil or criminal trial .
and believe me , with news like this ,
you do not want that .
we need to be able to speak
under cover of attorney @-@ client privilege ,
which diane provides , and we need it now !
go ahead , get permission .
hi , walter . still there ?
we also need to hire lockhart / gardner
as temporary counsel .
... as we learn more .
and get me the ceo of heather farms--
before he talks to a reporter .
here he comes now .
you just tell him what you told me .
what &apos;s wrong ? is everything all right ?
i don &apos;t know . i got a call from someone at the vindicator .
she asked if i had an opinion about the results
of the medical investigation of dr. farland .
i don &apos;t understand . it &apos;s a year off .
i know .
she said the fda expedited it .
she got an early look , and they &apos;re siding with dr. farland .
it may not be true .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
any rumor of an investigation that goes against us hurts us .
did this reporter say when she wanted a comment ?
this afternoon .
she has to go to press monday with the leak .
here &apos;s her number .
she &apos;s the metro editor .
kate hanson-- i know her . let me give her a call .
she &apos;ll be easy to stall .
thank you for doing this .
once more around the park .
so what do you think ?
i think we have a gun to our head ,
and can &apos;t wait for trial .
we have to get a good deal in mediation .
damn !
be right there .
owen , can you do me a favor ?
diane , we ...
i &apos;ll call you back .
i think the mediator &apos;s lying to us .
i think you &apos;re right .
two hours and a bottle of wine ,
we can settle this .
just this ? why not the middle east ?
it &apos;s game theory with imperfect information , will .
why don &apos;t we make it perfect ?
i thought you liked imperfect .
poker over chess .
you sure you &apos;re on the right floor ?
i &apos;m serious .
we used to settle a lot of things in the old days .
we used to unsettle a lot of things , too .
i &apos;m going into my room now .
you haven &apos;t heard our case yet . it &apos;s a good one .
then i can &apos;t wait . good @-@ bye , celeste .
my number .
when you &apos;re ready to negotiate .
the whole weekend .
maybe not the whole one .
it &apos;s hot , right ? the nights are hot ?
oh , steaming .
sultry with the scent of jasmine , forbidden love .
coat , no coat ?
no coat .
you &apos;re fine with this , right ?
i just need someone with the kids through sunday
sure . the fun uncle .
i &apos;m the fun uncle .
you and will , in a hotel room .
yes
will , me , four lawyers ,
six of their lawyers and a mediator
you and will check out the hot tub .
in a businessman &apos;s hotel .
the best sex i ever had was in a businessman &apos;s hotel .
oh , okay . can we not go there ?
you are so funny .
you are the most prudish wanton woman i know .
hey . what was that ?
what ? nothing . i have to go .
but you were about to say something .
you won &apos;t get in a fight with peter right ?
he &apos;s picking up the kids for dinner saturday night .
i didn &apos;t mean it--
about the &quot; wanton &quot;
alicia , talk to me .
owen , i would if i had the time .
you have to wait for the elevator ,
so talk to me here .
okay .
you &apos;re sleeping with will ,
which is why you left your husband .
oh , come on .
i &apos;ll call you later .
gretchen battista .
no , kate retired three months ago .
i &apos;m her replacement , mr ....
gardner .
yeah , so you &apos;ll be getting a package
in about an hour or so , ms. battista .
just ignore it .
oh , i already got it .
my parents drink scotch .
they &apos;ll be really grateful .
and what might you need ?
you contacted my client
for a comment on the fda investigation .
i thought i might help .
you wouldn &apos;t happen to be fishing for what i might know ,
would you , mr. gardner ?
i might be .
i just find it odd that you &apos;d be
the only reporter leaked an fda decision .
maybe i &apos;m just a better reporter .
and maybe you have a source that &apos;s lying
and trying to undermine this negotiation .
so come in for an interview , and you can offer some context .
okay . how about lunch on monday ?
oh , you mean after my deadline ? oh , i don &apos;t think so .
how about in my office in one hour ?
two hours .
i thought we had agreed this morning to lower your ask by $ 100,000 .
yes , and we reevaluated our position ,
and we &apos;re staying with our original ask .
i &apos;m glad you think it &apos;s funny .
i thought we were making progress .
oh , we are making progress .
mr. gardner has a tell .
when he &apos;s in trouble , he doubles down .
so we &apos;re lowering our offer .
you don &apos;t think the issues here
are too serious to treat like gambling ?
no , gambling is too serious to treat like these issues .
we &apos;re lowering our offer .
you all right ?
no .
okay .
yeah .
what are you doing ?
will wants me to get some inkling of their bottom line in mediation .
why ?
eli needs your help .
heather farms outside bloomington .
the usda is investigating this listeria outbreak ,
and they tend to be slow .
well , which takes priority , cheese or mediation ?
both .
all right , got it .
i expect mediation to extend through the weekend at least ,
so , um , i will be ...
there is no heather farms .
it &apos;s just one division of karpwell foods .
and i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m not your rabbi , sir .
i &apos;m merely trying to keep your cheese
from damaging the image of all cheeses .
well , i &apos;m sorry you feel that way , but i do care .
it &apos;s not even clear that we &apos;re responsible .
i mean , what else did these kids eat ?
that &apos;s what i want to know .
oh , yes , that &apos;s a great line of defense .
with images like these ,
people love to hear that the kids are really the problem .
do you know who tony hayward is ?
do i ...
yes , he &apos;s the ceo of british petroleum .
no , ex @-@ ceo of bp .
the man who many think oversaw the destruction of a brand .
so first thing &apos;s first , we work on your attitude .
excuse me ? i think we need to work on ...
look , i don &apos;t have time to argue with you .
the first rule of managing a crisis :
the top man answers the questions .
that is the only reason you &apos;re here ,
that is the only reason i am talking to you .
so , in ten minutes time , you &apos;re giving a press conference
where you &apos;ll order all your cheese products off the shelves .
we need a split screen of that image with you looking strong--
wrong tie , get him a red tie--
then you &apos;ll apologize for any missteps
and say the buck stops here .
actually , he can &apos;t do that .
actually , he can and he will .
no , legally , he &apos;s in a very vulnerable spot .
he can &apos;t be out there apologizing and taking blame .
he &apos;s gonna get sued no matter what .
yes , but the size of the suit is still in question .
i don &apos;t care about the size of the suit , diane .
yes , eli , but i do .
i &apos;ll just sit here then .
diane , you &apos;re only here as window dressing .
you &apos;re only here to keep us from getting subpoenaed .
no , i &apos;m here as their lawyer . you &apos;re working the images ...
and the images take precedent right now .
eli , listen to me ...
he won &apos;t have a business unless he ...
nice to meet you , mr. protopapas .
dr. farland was stopping by for lunch .
but if you have any questions ...
ms. serrano , could i speak with you ?
this is really inappropriate .
we were having lunch .
it &apos;s been on the books for weeks .
i am not listening to any evidence off the record , ma &apos;am .
and i am not offering any . i &apos;m standing on the record .
so is the plaintiff .
and they offer a convincing case .
an easily @-@ refuted case .
mrs. reeves is responsible for her own condition .
how do you figure ?
deposition 200 , page 14 .
it &apos;s so key , i know it from memory .
&quot; question : if there &apos;s nothing wrong with your device , doctor ,
how did it malfunction ? &quot;
it didn &apos;t malfunction .
even the best scss
are prone to lead migration .
and a lead is ... ?
oh , sorry .
when the electrical leads don &apos;t stay where intended .
it &apos;s usually not serious ,
but in the case of maggie , it became quite serious
because the problem went undetected for so long .
that &apos;s what caused the infection ,
which caused the permanent damage to her spine .
and why did it go undetected ?
well , i prescribed hydromorphone for any topical pain from the surgery ,
but mrs. reeves-- i &apos;m sorry to say this--
but she continued to use the painkiller long afterward .
so , if mrs. reeves hadn &apos;t overmedicated herself ,
she would have noticed the infection
and come to you for her scs adjustment ?
yes .
i &apos;m sorry , mrs. reeves ,
but it &apos;s true .
oh , come on .
why not blame the victim for having pain in the first place ?
yes , but is it true ?
the device malfunctioned , the pain returned .
only then did maggie take the painkillers .
celeste reverses it so she can make it
seem like the painkillers caused the problem .
if i can get her up to eight million , will you say yes ?
is she offering eight million ?
will you accept it ?
if you &apos;re asking for our bottom line , then no .
we can &apos;t give you our bottom line
or they &apos;ll use it against us .
where &apos;s kalinda ?
i thought she was looking into their bottom line .
i &apos;ll call . where are you going ?
to meet a reporter .
tonight , school officials are reassuring parents
that all cheese has been removed from the school lunch menu
for the time being .
it &apos;s not yet clear whether cheese at neighboring schools
and stores in the area may also be tainted .
grace !
stop eating the pizza !
really ?
you were the bad one ?
well , yeah , i was .
don &apos;t i seem like i was the bad one ?
so , in what way bad ?
mm , no , you don &apos;t want to hear this .
no , i do want to hear this .
ecstasy .
driving my car into a lake , stealing stuff , juvie .
and mom ?
she was perfect .
homework done , room clean , never did drugs .
never did anything .
she &apos;s still like that .
she was a good sister .
always covering for me .
you guys have a good mom .
grace &apos;s tutor .
hello ! hello . can we turn it down ?
sorry .
we &apos;re almost done .
so you &apos;re the , uh , the tutor ?
uh @-@ huh .
what subject ?
uh , physics .
and just science .
really ?
where do you go to school ?
uh , u of c.
and , um ...
what &apos;s this ?
we &apos;re making a video .
we &apos;re done with all my homework .
uh @-@ huh . got it .
understood .
oh , my god .
pretty ...
provocative stuff .
it &apos;s just street dancing .
yeah , just freestyle .
dad slept with somebody else .
dad . he slept with someone other than the hooker .
he ...
how do we know ?
he told me .
that &apos;s why mom kicked him out .
you didn &apos;t know that ?
i didn &apos;t know that .
what are they saying ?
they think it was an improper cleaning of the culture vats in line six .
you sound like you don &apos;t agree .
well , i clean line six with peroxyacetic acid
and quaternary ammonium after every culture .
they &apos;re not gonna find listeria there .
where else could listeria come from ?
we keep these units accurate to one degree either way .
i don &apos;t think it was a refrigeration problem .
so what do you think ?
i think it used to be an easy job to find the source .
now you got some of these cheeses--
they &apos;re a blend of three or four lines from three or four companies .
so all i can say is good luck .
damn . are you sure ?
uh , eli , you know this is a good thing , right ?
it looks like your client isn &apos;t responsible for the listeria .
kalinda , this is not the law .
i &apos;m not looking for innocence , i &apos;m looking for certainty .
the whole point is to bury this story with an apology ,
then move on .
so you want our guy to be guilty ?
no , i want it to be over .
i don &apos;t want to train another ceo
from some other company tomorrow to take the blame .
he can &apos;t say this .
he has to say it .
no , he can say , &quot; i offer my deepest ,
sincerest sympathies to the families . &quot;
and , &quot; i &apos;m doing everything i can
to trace the source of our missteps . &quot;
no .
&quot; the source of the outbreak ...
really ? really , diane ?
he can &apos;t say anything that sounds like an admission ...
really ?
i am doing everything i can
to trace the source of the outbreak .
heather farms is committed to finding the root of this ...
so why should i hold your story ?
well , the scotch for one .
and because it &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s not true that dr. farland &apos;s being investigated ?
no , it &apos;s not true the investigation is going farland &apos;s way .
and you know this how ?
i know this because i can see who has an agenda .
in this case , the defense .
heads up .
why should i care ?
because i can make you care .
okay .
i &apos;ll give you complete back channel on the case .
uh , as pulse @-@ racing as that is ,
get me back channel on this .
your computer ?
mm , no , the cheese thing .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
the listeria outbreak .
all the sick kids , some were hospitalized ...
eli gold is part of your firm , right ?
i &apos;ll delay my story ,
you get me the back channel ticktock on the crisis managing .
i &apos;ll have to talk to eli .
well , then it wouldn &apos;t be a back channel , would it ?
get me something behind the scenes .
let me see what i can do .
oh , and by the way , uh ,
it &apos;s not the fda investigation that &apos;s concluding .
what do you mean ?
the call i got was about the state &apos;s attorney .
turns out ,
they decided not to bring fraud charges against dr. farland .
may i help you ?
you may .
i need information about a fraud investigation .
are you sure ?
am i sure i have nothing to offer you about our fraud investigation ? i am .
we just need to know if this leak to gretchen battista
was faked , cary , that &apos;s all .
and if it was , then we need to get her to hold her story .
i understand .
i still have nothing .
how have you been ?
oh , come on .
kalinda , you can fake somebody else , but you can &apos;t fake me .
what am i faking ?
interest , concern , friendship .
and what if i &apos;m not ?
then let &apos;s be friends .
but i still don &apos;t have anything for you
about this fraud investigation .
check with matan ; it &apos;s his case .
hmm , he &apos;s no use .
because he doesn &apos;t want to sleep with you ?
but you do ?
i &apos;m merely making an observation .
and what observation might that be ?
you tend to use people &apos;s feelings to further your investigations .
you think that &apos;s what i did with you ?
i think i have to get back to work .
cary , whatever i felt , i didn &apos;t invent .
that &apos;s great to know , kalinda .
now i have to get back to work and i think you do , too .
yeah .
the ceo questioned the need to recall all cheese products ,
suggesting that the listeria victims themselves
could have been responsible for the sickness .
i don &apos;t know that much about it at this point ,
but i @-@ i would love to know what else those kids were eating
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s just the cheese .
excuse me .
look , i think it &apos;s a little premature at this point ...
what the hell ?
what the hell ? !
what did you say ?
what did you say ?
what are you talking about ?
i @-@ i said exactly what you told me ...
&quot; i don &apos;t know enough , but what else did these kids eat &quot; ?
you know what you do when you don &apos;t know enough ?
you shut the hell up .
i didn &apos;t say that .
with a garbage bag in your hand ?
what are you , chico and the man ?
oh , that-- that was in the morning , before i met you .
the press was in front of my house .
they &apos;re playing it like you just said it .
they can &apos;t do that .
oh , where do you live-- fairyland ?
of course they can do that .
okay , eli , what now ?
well , he &apos;s burned as a spokesman .
you &apos;re going to have to get
all the cheese off all the shelves in illinois .
no , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s possible .
he just blamed the victim . it just became possible .
owen , thank you so much .
i &apos;ve been in mediation all day , couldn &apos;t get away .
how are the kids ?
good .
grace is bonding with a shy dance teacher
and peter told zach that he slept with another woman .
what ?
oh , grace is bonding with a ...
no , what did peter say ?
oh , yeah , he told zach , your son , that he , peter ,
was at fault for you kicking him out
&apos;cause he slept with somebody else ,
and so now i &apos;m wondering who that somebody else was .
zach told you this ?
he did .
and what did zach say to him ?
to pe-- nothing .
i think he just took it in .
so who , who is it ?
i have to go back to work .
come on ,
alicia , work is like this new avoidance tactic for you .
is zach all right ?
zach &apos;s fine .
zach ... he &apos;s , he &apos;s wondering how you are .
how ... how are you ?
i &apos;ve got to get back to work .
there you are .
kuhn ?
yep , i think you were up by 32 last time we played .
nine years ago ?
that &apos;s right , you always hated my memory thing .
one cheerio ante ?
two-- inflation .
so i heard you got married .
twice .
heard you didn &apos;t .
you were always bad at bluffing .
who &apos;s the lady friend ?
the ... ?
the lawyer .
i get a strong possessive sense there .
you &apos;re not going to say ?
i say either way , you &apos;ll use it in negotiations .
call .
so how do you know gretchen ?
gretchen ?
the reporter . through your firm ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
hmm , so are we gonna play cards all night
or are we gonna negotiate ?
how about both ?
you lose this hand ,
you convince your client to take my deal .
i lose this hand ,
i convince my client to take your deal .
what deal ?
$ 10 million .
and if i lose ?
she takes $ 500,000 .
so that &apos;s your bottom line , huh , $ 10 million ?
i miss you , will , i really do .
why did you drop out ?
i didn &apos;t .
moved on .
to ... ?
adulthood .
as i remember , we did some pretty adult things ourselves .
come on , one bet .
we settle this like adults .
no mediator .
your lady friend will be so impressed
when you show up at her door with $ 10 million in your hand .
no , thanks .
oh , come on .
where &apos;s the old will ?
embrace the risk .
no , thanks .
wuss .
too bad , you would have won .
anything ?
they want to pay $ 500,000,
but they &apos;re willing to go to $ 10 million .
you &apos;re kidding ?
nope .
we were willing to take $ 5 million .
the only bad news is , i don &apos;t think she planted
the story with gretchen ,
but i can &apos;t tell .
she &apos;s a good bluffer .
anything else ?
yeah , she &apos;s gonna try to play you .
in what way ?
jealousy .
using your past ?
to what end ?
rattle you ,
get you to admit the bottom line just for the kick of it .
so you and her , huh ?
two years .
i just don &apos;t see it .
i was a different person .
and she &apos;s the same ?
oh , yeah .
well ...
what if i play jealous ...
... for the mediator ?
maybe you should .
tantric sex .
no , sex sex .
no , no , tantric sex .
you have to eschew frictional orgasm
for a higher form of ecstasy .
no , can &apos;t we have a little frictional orgasm ?
we don &apos;t touch , we don &apos;t undress .
we talk about our childhoods ,
anything but sex .
delaying gratification is to increase gratification .
yeah , but i &apos;ve spent the last three hours doing laundry ,
and the kids are gonna be home in a couple of hours ,
so i don &apos;t really have time for delayed gratification .
they &apos;re home early .
oh , owen .
hello . what a surprise .
uh , how are you ?
jackie , how ... funny .
yes , so peter asked me to pick up zach and grace .
i hope you don &apos;t mind , i have my old key .
oh , hello .
hello .
my name is finn .
uh , finn &apos;s a friend of mine from school .
jackie , you &apos;re a little early .
yes , well , i thought i &apos;d clean up .
it always gets so messy here .
but , um , why don &apos;t i come back later ?
no , no , sit down , talk with us .
you must have incredible stories to tell about your life .
finn , jackie &apos;s early .
she needs to go .
no , no , thi @-@ this is a perfect moment for us to learn about her past .
tell us about your childhood .
my childhood ?
yes .
where should i start ?
chicago was very different when i was a girl .
no , mommy will help you .
no , mommy will .
i have to go .
good @-@ bye .
kids ?
boy and girl .
you think this mediation is hard ?
i &apos;m really sorry about all of this .
hey , they &apos;re all tough .
we just have to remain human .
how do we do that ?
find a box for this
and keep it in that box .
thank you .
no change that you &apos;re gonna find
we are not paying a cent above her medical bills .
then let &apos;s go to court .
you failed , will .
just face the fact .
okay , stop .
how did i ... ?
the point of bringing you two together is to talk , not to shout .
i know what it looks like when he fails ,
and he is failing .
alicia , talk to him .
excuse me ?
i &apos;m just saying , will and i talked last night ...
celeste ...
what ?
and we were trying to negotiate a deal ,
but clearly his ego got in the way ,
and i used to be able to talk to him .
i can &apos;t talk to him now ,
so you &apos;ll have to talk to him .
celeste , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m talking to her .
i &apos;m just saying that will and i got together ,
we had a productive session , that &apos;s all ,
and i was thinking we should do that again .
okay , i think we &apos;ve taken a turn towards the personal ,
and what i think we should maybe ...
excuse me .
okay , you want to be productive ?
let &apos;s be productive .
you already tried the blame @-@ the @-@ victim defense
with your painkiller o.d. fiction .
that didn &apos;t work .
who &apos;s saying it didn &apos;t work ?
i am .
well , we &apos;ll prove the opposite in court .
no , you won &apos;t .
i know the judge . he won &apos;t allow it .
so maybe you should raise .

deposition 207 , page 13 .
what &apos;s this ? the backup plan ?
&quot; question : so you believe you were within your rights
&quot; to manufacture this scs device ,
&quot; and dr. farland was within his rights
to implant it in his patient &quot; &quot;
of course .
according to the fda &apos;s own rules .
but mr. gardner seemed to imply
that dr. farland was josef mengele .
josef ... ?
the ...
that &apos;s okay .
fda rules say
that you were within your rights to manufacture this device , correct ?
yes . they allow manufacturers , like ourselves , to decide
which devices need to be submitted to them for approval .
and if a new device is merely a minor modification ,
then , according to fda guidelines ,
it doesn &apos;t need approval .
ms. serrano &apos;s reading is surprisingly selective .
why don &apos;t you keep going ?
what is this ?
that ? it &apos;s a br1 . it &apos;s a spinal cord stimulator .
and this is fda approved ?
yes .
and you claim that dr. farland &apos;s scs
is a minor modification of this ?
yes . that &apos;s why we didn &apos;t need to submit it to them for approval .
so , then what is this ?
that &apos;s dr. farland &apos;s scs .
so , you &apos;re saying
that this is a minor modification of this ?
ira , you can &apos;t judge these with a layman &apos;s eye .
medical professionals
who manufactured dr. farland &apos;s device concluded
that these two devices were similar .
these two ?
yes .
in fact , i anticipated
mr. gardner &apos;s bringing this issue up again ,
so i had a study done
by the respected benzor labs in quantico , virginia .
what &apos;s it say ?
that it &apos;s a minor modification .
the mediator &apos;s on our side .
yup . nice job , by the way , but
he still was impressed by this .
okay , so we have to get someone to say it was vastly modified .
we need kalinda .
i want to repeat , this is only a precaution .
we are removing all karpwell cheese from circulation .
yeah . gretchen , i &apos;m kind of busy right now . what do you need ?
so you &apos;re the man behind the cheese ,
eli , is that right ?
i &apos;m the ...
who told you that ?
an unnamed source .
and what else did this unnamed source tell you ?
he said you &apos;re crisis managing for the listeria outbreak ,
and that you investigated heather farms ,
and the outbreak &apos;s not from there .
... the political revival
of scandal @-@ plagued state &apos;s attorney , peter florrick .
he is also known for being a tough infighter .
though never confirmed , eli gold was also thought
to be the architect of an ugly racial attack on his opponent .
so , why is this wholesome brand hiring a spin doctor
known for rehabilitating scandalized politicians ?
are you there , eli ?
hello .
eli gold ...
any comment ?
... one of the first political campaign managers
to understand the power of social media ...
i &apos;m not part of the story .
oh . i &apos;m sorry , eli .
you just became part of the story .
so pull up a chair .
... makes him a highly sought after crisis manager ...
it &apos;s not all bad , eli .
it is all bad .
you become the story ,
it deflects from your client &apos;s guilt .
i become the story , it makes my clients look guiltier .
who leaked it , diane ?
eli , it &apos;s a fool &apos;s game to look for a leaker .
gretchen knew we checked heather farms .
she knew it was clean .
i told two people about that-- you
and kalinda-- but gretchen said the leaker was a he .
did you tell will ?
oh , he went to the kids &apos; vigil .
i thought you said he was burned .
he was .
you &apos;re changing the subjec
i am . so , you tried to un @-@ burn him ?
you haven &apos;t seen this yet ?
oh , my god .
it &apos;s wonderful , isn &apos;t it ?
people love humility .
tony hayward needed a pie in the face .
you didn &apos;t .
oh , set it up ? no . that was just luck .
i thought he &apos;d just get booed .
i &apos;m proud to be here today .
i don &apos;t care in what condition .
among those attending the prayer service
was the ceo of heather farms , walter kermani .
i &apos;m good at my job , diane ,
but i can &apos;t have leakers .
it &apos;s unprofessional .
will didn &apos;t leak .
so you &apos;re here to give up .
ten million , and we won &apos;t accept a penny less .
really ?
you and your lawyer friend cook something up ?
it didn &apos;t work for you to blame the painkiller .
it didn &apos;t work for you to blame the victim ,
so minor modification .
that &apos;s what your case rests on now .
dr. farland &apos;s scs is merely a minor modification
of existing scss .
have some pastrami , will .
let &apos;s leave all this boring medical talk behind .
the problem is , medicine is a lot like politics .
and all we had to do was follow the money .
she never was jealous , was she ?
your lawyer friend .
that was all a piece of playacting ?
dr. farland , your man of healing ,
invented an scs to make money .
30 % on every device implanted .
oh . sorry . sorry .
who was that ?
kalinda .
here &apos;s a copy for you .
what is this ?
farland &apos;s patent application .
yeah , i know .
it &apos;s a good read , though .
the problem for you is ,
dr. farland had to insist on its originality .
i get it .
you don &apos;t have to lord it over me .
no , i won , so you have to listen .
dr. farland had to insist on the originality
of his device to file a patent .
&quot; this scs is a truly original development
&quot; in severe back pain management .
it is not a mere modification . &quot;
how nice of him to use those words .
... &quot; of existing scss on the market .
&quot; therefore , patent .. &quot;
i can read .
you &apos;re not going to be a sore loser , are you ?
eight million dollars .
ten . by today .
no .
eight . that &apos;s more than you thought you &apos;d get .
i &apos;ll talk to my client .
i need a new home .
you need a ... ?
new home .
my firm is going under .
monty &amp; columbech ?
breaking up .
litigation &apos;s going one way , acquisitions another .
how many in litigation ?
me . eight other top @-@ flight lawyers .
we need a home .
i &apos;ll check with diane .
i miss you .
ira ?
so , it looks like we &apos;ll make a deal .
i heard .
i just wanted to thank you for all of your hard work .
you don &apos;t have to thank me .
i wasn &apos;t the one who played them .
we ...
that &apos;s not why we won .
you won because of the facts .
you got your client rich
because you played them ... and me .
that &apos;s not fair .
it is fair .
it may not be polite , but it is fair .
don &apos;t worry about it .
if i needed a lawyer , i &apos;d probably hire you , too .
very nice to meet you .
hey , mom .
just wanted to see how you were doing .
how &apos;s your thing ?
it was good .
i don &apos;t know .
i go back and forth on work .
same with dad .
i want to do something very old @-@ fashioned .
i want to kiss you on the forehead .
is that all right ?
sure .
tucking in is too much .
right .
sorry .
love you .
i &apos;m getting boring .
getting ?
i &apos;m serious .
i used to be ... interesting .
i spent the entire day
doing laundry and watching daytime tv .
i saw the clothes .
thank you .
i mean , when did this happen ?
you &apos;re the one out having sex with your boyfriend .
owen ...
and i &apos;m the one at home with the kids .
and it &apos;s much appreciated .
are you gonna get hurt by this guy ?
i don &apos;t know .
i have no perspective .
you should have rebelled in high school .
then you wouldn &apos;t have to do it now .
is that what this is , rebellion ?
or love .
it &apos;s not love , is it ?
no .
good .
