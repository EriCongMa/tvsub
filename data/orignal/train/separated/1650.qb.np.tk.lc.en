this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster .
i asked for turkey and roast beef
with lettuce and swiss on whole wheat .
what did they give you ?
turkey and roast beef
with swiss and lettuce on whole wheat .
it &apos;s the right ingredients , but in the wrong order .
in a proper sandwich ,
the cheese is adjacent to the bread
to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce .
they might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash .
i don &apos;t believe it .
i know. it &apos;s basic culinary science .
some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop
from the original film , and no one is bidding on it .
a time machine from the movie the time machine ?
no. a time machine from sophie &apos;s choice .
boy , sophie could have used a time machine in that movie .
did you see it ? it &apos;s rough .
oh , that &apos;s cool .
it &apos;s only $ 800 ?
yeah. and that &apos;s my bid .
you bid $ 800 ?
it was a spur @-@ of @-@ the @-@ moment thing .
i figured it would go for thousands ,
and i just wanted to be a part of it .
there &apos;s only 30 seconds left in the auction .
do you have $ 800 ?
not to blow on a miniature time machine .
well , don &apos;t worry. the way these things work
is people wait until the last second to bid ,
and then they swoop in and get it. it &apos;s called sniping .
15 seconds .
come on , snipers .
ten , nine , eight ...
where are your snipers ?
five ... snipe .
four ... snipe .
three ... snipe !
two ... snipe !
one ...
congratulations !
you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine !
you lucky duck .
i wonder why no one else bid .
this is a classic piece of sci @-@ fi movie memorabilia .
yeah , i know ! i still can &apos;t afford it .
why don &apos;t we share it ?
we &apos;ll each put in 200 bucks , and we &apos;ll
take turns having it in our house .
a time @-@ share time machine .
i &apos;m in. sheldon ?
need you ask ?
i still don &apos;t understand why no one else bid .
i understand why no one else bid .
did the listing actually say &quot; miniature &quot; ?
i just assumed .
who sells a full @-@ size time machine for $ 800 ?
in a venn diagram , that would be an individual located
within the intersection of the sets &quot; no longer want my time machine &quot;
and &quot; need $ 800 . &quot;
it &apos;s actually a tremendous bargain .
even with shipping , it works out
to less than four dollars a pound .
cocktail shrimp are $ 12.50 .
how are we going to get it upstairs ?
if we take the dish off ,
it might fit in the elevator .
yes , but the elevator has been broken for two years .
i &apos;ve been meaning to ask you .
do you think we should make a call about that ?
not necessary .
i have a master &apos;s in engineering .
i remotely repair satellites on a regular basis .
i troubleshoot space shuttle payloads .
when the mars rover started pulling to the left , i performed
a front @-@ end alignment from 62 million miles away .
no. that baby &apos;s broken .
come on , guys ! push !
if i push any harder ,
i &apos;m going to give birth to my colon .
i can &apos;t feel my fingers. hurry up !
it &apos;s the same amount of work
no matter how fast you go .
basic physics .
sheldon ? yeah ?
if my fingers ever work again ,
i &apos;ve got a job for the middle one .
oh. hey , guys .
oh. hi , penny .
take a break , guys .
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re just , you know , moving something upstairs .
what is it ?
just ... you know. time machine .
yeah. okay. neat. but i really got to get to work .
just give us a few minutes . i don &apos;t have a few minutes .
i &apos;m running really late .
then , i have a simple solution .
go up to the roof. hop over to the next building .
there &apos;s a small gap--
don &apos;t look down if you &apos;re subject to vertigo--
and use their stairwell .
you &apos;re joking , right ?
oh , i never joke when it comes to vertigo .
damn. okay , i &apos;ll just take the roof .
hey , if you wait for us to set up the time machine ,
i can drop you off at work yesterday .
time travel joke. it &apos;s not ... never mind .
for what it &apos;s worth , i thought it was humorous .
let &apos;s just do this .
you guys ready to push ?
in a minute .
howard stepped outside to throw up .
i don &apos;t know what you were worried about .
i think it really works in the room .
yeah .
it is by far the coolest thing
i have ever owned .
the exact time machine that carried actor rod taylor
from victorian england
into the post @-@ apocalyptic future ,
where society had splintered into the two factions
the subterranean morlocks , who survived by feasting
on the flesh of the gentle surface @-@ dwelling eloi .
talk about your chick magnets .
oh , yeah .
the guy who lives next to me is always like ,
&quot; i have a jacuzzi on my balcony .
i have a jacuzzi on my balcony . &quot;
but wait until i tell him ,
&quot; i &apos;ve got a time machine on my balcony .
stuff that in your speedo , jacuzzi bob . &quot;
gentlemen , i know we said we &apos;d take turns ,
but i think you &apos;ll agree
that practicality dictates it remain here .
you can &apos;t just keep it here .
what if i meet a girl and say ,
&quot; you want to come up and see my time machine ?
it &apos;s at my friends &apos; house . &quot;
how lame is that ?
he &apos;s got a point. all right ,
i think we &apos;re going to need some ground rules ; in addition
to the expected &quot; no shoes in the time machine , &quot;
and &quot; no eating in the time machine , &quot;
i propose we add &quot; pants must be worn
at all times in the time machine . &quot;
seconded .
i was going to put down a towel .
i still want it on my balcony .
i say we move it on a bi @-@ monthly basis .
yeah , that sounds fair .
hold on , bi @-@ monthly is an ambiguous term .
do you mean move it every other month or twice a month ?
twice a month. then no .
okay , every other month .
no .
sheldon , you can &apos;t be selfish .
we all paid for it , so it belongs to all of us .
now get out of the way so i can sit in my time machine .
okay , i am setting the dials for march 10 , 1876 .
good choice , alexander graham bell
invents the telephone and calls out for dr. watson .
wait a minute . i &apos;d want to see that , too .
so when it &apos;s your turn , you can .
but if we all go back to the same point in time ,
bell &apos;s lab is going to get very crowded .
he &apos;ll know something &apos;s up .
also since the time machine doesn &apos;t move in space ,
you &apos;ll end up in 1876 pasadena .
and even if you can make it to boston , what are you going to do ?
knock on the door and say to mrs. bell ,
&quot; hey , mrs. bell. big fan of your husband .
can i come in and watch him invent the telephone ? &quot;
mrs. bell was deaf .
she &apos;s not even going to hear you knock .
i have a solution .
first , go into the future and obtain a cloaking device .
ooh , how far into the future ?
if i remember correctly ,
captain kirk will steal a cloaking device
from the romulans on stardate 5027.3,
which would be january 10 , 2328 by pre @-@ federation reckoning .
okay , i am setting the dials for january 10 , 2328 .
here we go into the future .
that was fun .
my turn !
okay , first of all ,
what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide .
i slipped and skinned my knee. are you okay ?
second of all , the door to the stairwell
of the other building was locked ,
so i had to go down the fire escape ,
which ends on the third floor ,
forcing me to crawl through the window
of a lovely armenian family
who insisted i stay for lunch .
that doesn &apos;t sound too bad .
it was eight courses of lamb ,
and they tried to fix me up with their son .
i &apos;m sorry. not done .
by the time i finally
got to work , they &apos;d given my shift away .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
i lost an entire day &apos;s pay thanks to this .
this ... time machine .
the lights flash and the dish spins. you want to try it ?
no !
i don &apos;t want to try it !
my god , you are grown men !
how can you waste your lives with these
stupid toys and costumes
and comic books and ... and now that ? !
that ... again. time machine .
oh , please , it &apos;s not a time machine .
if anything , it looks like something
elton john would drive through the everglades .
it only moves in time .
it would be worse than useless in a swamp .
pathetic ! all of you !
completely pathetic !
my turn .
leonard , it &apos;s 2 : 00 in the morning .
so ?
so it &apos;s my turn .
why did you set it for the day before yesterday ?
because i want to go back and keep myself
from getting a time machine .
you can &apos;t. if you were to prevent yourself
from buying it in the past ,
you would not have it available in the present
to travel back and stop yourself
from buying it. ergo , you would still have it .
this is a classic rookie time @-@ travel mistake .
can i go back and prevent you from explaining that to me ?
same paradox .
if you were to travel back in time
and , say , knock me unconscious ,
you would not then have the conversation
that irritated you , motivating you
to go back and knock me unconscious .
what if i knocked you unconscious right now ?
it won &apos;t change the past .
but it &apos;d make the present so much nicer .
are you upset about something ?
what was your first clue ?
well , it was a number of things .
first , the late hour .
then your demeanor seems very low @-@ energy ,
plus your irritability .
yes , i &apos;m upset !
i don &apos;t usually pick up on those things .
good for me .
yeah , good for you .
oh , wait .
did you want to talk about what &apos;s bothering you ?
i don &apos;t know. maybe .
wow . i &apos;m on fire tonight .
uh ... here &apos;s the thing .
girls like penny never end up with guys who own time machines .
i disagree .
your inability to successfully woo penny
long predates your acquisition of the time machine .
that failure clearly stands on its own .
thanks for pointing it out .
in addition , your premise is flawed .
in the original film , rod taylor got yvette mimieux
with that very time machine .
in back to the future , marty mcfly got the opportunity
to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother .
those are movies .
of course they &apos;re movies .
were you expecting me to come up with an example
involving a real @-@ life time machine ?
that &apos;s absurd .
come on , guys , push !
if i push any harder ,
i &apos;m going to give birth to my colon .
oh , hey , guys .
oh. hi , penny .
take a break , guys !
what are you doing ?
oh , you know , just moving a time machine .
yeah. okay , neat , but i really gotta get to work , so ...
no problem .
hang on .
but ... what about your time machine ?
some things are more important than toys .
i &apos;m scared .
don &apos;t worry , baby . i &apos;ve got you .
oh , leonard .
it &apos;s still my turn .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m packing up all my collectibles
and taking them down to the comic book store to sell .
was that really necessary ?
if you need money , you can always sell blood .
and semen .
this is not about money .
we brought food !
lox and bagels , the breakfast of time @-@ travelers .
terrific .
does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine ?
why ?
i don &apos;t want it anymore .
why ?
just ... personal reasons .
my spidey sense tells me
this has something to do with penny .
look ,
do you want to buy me out or not ? i &apos;ll give you
a hundred dollars , which will make me half @-@ owner
and we &apos;ll put it on my balcony .
screw his balcony .
i &apos;ll give you $ 120 and we &apos;ll put it in my garage .
i paid $ 200 for my share .
dude , everybody knows
a time machine loses half its value
the minute you drive it off the lot .
i &apos;ll go for $ 200 .
that time machine stays right where it is .
$ 300 and i &apos;ll throw in
my original 1979 mattel millennium falcon
with real light speed sound effects .
no. no more toys or action figures
or props or replicas or costumes or robots
or darth vader voice changers .
i &apos;m getting rid of all of it .
you can &apos;t do that .
look what you &apos;ve created here .
it &apos;s like nerdvana .
more importantly ,
you have a darth vader voice changer ?
not for long .
oh , i call dibs on the golden age flash .
hang on . i need that
to complete my justice society of america collection .
too bad . i called dibs .
you can &apos;t just call dibs . i can and i did .
look up &quot; dibs &quot; in wikipedia .
dibs doesn &apos;t apply in a bidding war .
it &apos;s not a bidding war .
i &apos;m selling it all to larry down at the comic book store .
why larry ? did larry call dibs ?
will you forget dibs ? !
he offered me a fair price
for the whole collection .
what &apos;s the number ? i &apos;ll match it .
i &apos;ll match it plus a thousand rupees .
what &apos;s the exchange rate ? none of your business .
take it or leave it ?
mom ? my bar mitzvah bonds .
how much do i got ?
thanks .
i can go $ 2,600 and two trees in israel .
forget it , guys .
if i sell to one of you ,
the other two are going to be really mad at me .
who cares ?
as long as you pick me !
okay , leonard , put down the box .
let &apos;s talk. sorry , raj .
my mind is made up .
no !
i can &apos;t let you do this .
sheldon , get out of my way .
none shall pass !
okay .
i did not want to do this , but
i have here the rare mint condition production error
star trek the next generation geordi la forge
without his visor in the original packaging .
if you do not get out of my way ,
i will open it .
okay , man. be cool .
we &apos;re all friends here .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
you hypocrite !
what ?
little miss &quot; grown @-@ ups don &apos;t play with toys . &quot;
if i were to go into that apartment right now ,
would i not find beanie babies ?
are you not an accumulator
of care bears and my little ponies ?
and who is that japanese feline i see frolicking on your shorts ?
hello , hello kitty !
okay .
okay , look , if this is about yesterday , leonard ,
i am really sorry about what i said .
i was just upset .
no , i needed to hear it .
no , you didn &apos;t. look , you are a great guy
and it is the things you love that make you who you are .
i guess that makes me &quot; large breasts . &quot;
still ,
i think it &apos;s time for me to get rid of this stuff
and , you know , move on with my life .
really ?
yeah .
well , good for you .
thanks .
hey , do you want to ...
i don &apos;t know , later ...
excuse me .
hey , penny. hi , mike .
you ready to go ? oh , yeah . i just have to change .
i &apos;ll give you a hand .
oh , stop it !
bye , guys .
my turn on the time machine .
it worked .
it really worked .
they said i was mad , but it worked !
oh , no !
not morlocks !
not flesh @-@ eating morlocks !
help !
sheldon ,
are you okay ?
we have to get rid of the time machine .
it is a little big for the living room , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , that &apos;s the problem .
it &apos;s too big .
glad you agree . i &apos;m to help us move it .
come on in , fellas .
oh , no .
morlocks !
