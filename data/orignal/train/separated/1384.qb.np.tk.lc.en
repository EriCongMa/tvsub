7 , 8 , 9 , 10,
11 , 12 ...
no peeking , robby !
... 13 , 14 ...
last game , everyone ! we &apos;ve got robby &apos;s birthday cake soon !
this way , wendy -- behind the pool house . - ... 19 , 20 !
i &apos;ve got a better spot .
ready or not , here i come !
wendy ?
wendy !
come on , the game &apos;s over !
wendy !
wendy ?
so , the secret to this is to go slow .
this ragu needs love , patience , and commitment .
i want to eat it . i don &apos;t want
to settle down and have kids with it .
yeah , well , you should be so lucky
to find a man as good as my ragu .
oh , this is nice .
it &apos;s a two @-@ bedroom townhouse in arlington .
or would you rather be closer to d.c. ?
you know , all the wonderful restaurants ,
the kennedy center , the national gallery ...
yeah , okay , where-- wherever ,
just as long as i don &apos;t have to pretend to be a redskins fan .
taste .
okay .
how is it ?
that is good .
no !
that &apos;s bad .
it needs salt !
okay .
listen , you &apos;re gonna be 400 miles away .
trust me , you &apos;re gonna want the taste of home cooking .
okay .
salt it .
jane , you should really explore
all these different neighborhoods online .
i &apos;m gonna add that to your checklist .
oka-- i have a checklist ?
yes ! i &apos;ve started a little relocation journal for you .
organization is vital for a successful move .
i said salt it , not brine it !
oh . oh , and you &apos;ll need to start a change @-@ of @-@ address list .
and maybe i should teach you to make the cannoli .
and , of course , you &apos;ll have to contact the dmv and the irs .
okay , enough !
i know you two are trying to help ,
but i just cannot talk about this move anymore .
but i thought you were excited about the move .
i am .
at least , i want to be , but i just ...
you know , when i think about being gone ,
i think about not seeing you both every day .
i just -- you know , it &apos;s tough .
it sucks !
wait , ma , no .
come on , don &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s just so far .
wh-- not you , too !
and i &apos;m tried of crying .
let &apos;s make cannoli , okay ?
and let &apos;s make a list , okay ? we love lists .
come on , you guys .
if we start , we &apos;re never gonna stop . okay ?
so , ju--
fine . i &apos;ll get the wine .
want red or white ?
hey , did you get any feedback from that editor yet ?
no , but i may not hear anything for several weeks .
okay , you gave him three chapters to your mystery novel .
how long does this take ?
well , he &apos;s very busy .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;m not high on his priority list .
well , you will be when he reads it .
who can resist a stiletto to the temple ?
morning .
detective .
where are you going ?
ah , korsak wanted me to canvass the neighborhood ,
find out if anyone saw anything .
i think he knew the guy .
the victim ?
yeah .
he &apos;s not showing it , but he seems pretty upset .
okay .
victim was walter sokoloff --
retired carpenter , 77 .
neighbor saw him through the window and called it in .
sokoloff .
wasn &apos;t there a case file that you asked us to review
a couple years ago that has &quot; sokoloff &quot; in it ?
that &apos;s right . it was a young girl at a birthday party .
blunt @-@ force trauma , some dna was recovered ,
but no match in the database .
that was wendy sokoloff .
i was dating her older sister , mary , when wendy was murdered .
the victim is their father .
you sure you want to be here ?
well , yeah . it was a long time ago .
um ... any sign of forced entry ?
no . nothing seems to be missing , either .
hey , look at this .
looks like he was 20 years sober .
it also looks like he was old @-@ school with his contacts .
probably a number for mary in there .
okay , i &apos;ll make the call .
no , it should come from me .
okay .
matt , can you make sure to collect and bag
all the pillows in the house ?
you got it , dr. isles .
you think he was smothered ?
yes .
there &apos;s evident cyanosis
and numerous petechial hemorrhages in the skin ,
which is consistent with asphyxia .
and i &apos;m seeing some fibers around the nose and mouth ,
so we &apos;ll test that at the lab .
killer attacks him in the chair , smothers him with a pillow .
there &apos;s a struggle .
we might be able to find dna on his hands
or under his fingernails .
looks like the killer finished the job right here on the floor .
you know , this doesn &apos;t look random .
it looks like he was targeted .
hasn &apos;t this family suffered enough ?
‭ i checked the neighborhood .
sokoloff was well @-@ liked , no problems anyone knew about .
how &apos;s sergeant korsak doing ?
well , he says he &apos;s fine , but he seemed pretty shaken up .
how about you ?
you still ... okay with everything ?
by &quot; everything , &quot; i assume you mean
our spontaneous decision to change our lives forever ?
yeah , that .
i feel more than okay .
i feel great . you ?
great .
i can &apos;t believe that we &apos;re actually getting married .
i know .
we have to tell everyone . no secrets this time .
absolutely .
but ... not right now .
well , the proposal happened so quick ,
i didn &apos;t have time to get you a ring .
frankie , that &apos;s so sweet !
but we can &apos;t spend a lot .
we have to pay for the wedding and the honeymoon --
i @-@ i promise not to spend a lot .
but ... i want to do it right .
fine .
you do that ,
and i &apos;ll handle the honeymoon .
how are you gonna do that ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ll think of something .
i called walter &apos;s daughter mary . she &apos;s driving in .
okay .
i found something interesting .
walter volunteered for an organization
called the victim advocacy group .
i know them .
yeah , i interviewed a murder victim &apos;s family
who had a woman from that group with them .
she was a counselor or something ?
yeah .
their volunteers help and advise victims &apos; families
through the grief process .
they even offer guidance through the investigation and trial .
sounds like walter never really got over wendy &apos;s death .
maybe he figured out a way to channel that pain
into something good .
well , let &apos;s look into all the cases he worked .
maybe something will pop out .
all right .
all right , well , just let me know if you think of anything else .
thank you very much .
okay , well , that was walter &apos;s sponsor .
he said he never heard of any problems or any threats .
how &apos;d you do with the victims program ?
i might have found something .
that &apos;s vanessa flores .
her son was killed six years ago outside a bar in roxbury .
the man who shot him was up for parole last week .
... why i urge you to deny parole .
so , walter sokoloff was her advocate ?
he &apos;s been with the family since the time of the murder .
here it is .
this is bullshit !
nate said he &apos;s sorry ! he &apos;s learned his lesson !
that &apos;s wayne fellows , the murderer &apos;s brother .
yo , touch me again and i &apos;ll kick your ass .
you -- you think i won &apos;t ? !
i &apos;ll kill you !
all right , well , let &apos;s bring wayne fellows in
and have a little talk .
detective rizzoli ?
hi .
agent davies .
that &apos;s the agent from quantico ? mm @-@ hmm .
uh , this -- this is nina holiday .
this is agent ... davies from quantico .
nice to meet you .
pleasure &apos;s all mine .
is there , um , is there someplace we could talk ?
yeah .
now a good time ?
yeah .
privately .
is something wrong ? is there a problem with the job ?
no , no , there &apos;s no problem .
it &apos;s , um , i mean , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s related
but , um ... but , you know , unrelated .
not helping at all .
yeah , um , see -- all right , the thing is , i , um ,
i @-@ i was just in town , and i thought ,
um , do you have ... time for dinner ?
like , a professional @-@ colleagues dinner ?
just ... dinner .
you know , a @-@ a chance to talk about things .
what things ? !
important things .
‭ it &apos;s nothing bad . i promise .
come on . we had fun over drinks .
right ? i mean , didn &apos;t we ?
we -- yeah , we did .
&apos;cause i did .
i did , too .
okay . i thought , &quot; let &apos;s go for 2 and 0 . &quot;
all right .
nothing fancy .
beer and burgers it is .
okay .
okay .
petechial hemorrhaging is present
in the mucosa of the lips and the interior of the mouth .
there &apos;s also evidence of pulmonary edema
due to suffocating .
hi . did you find anything ?
well , time of death is somewhere
6 : 00 and 9 : 00 yesterday evening .
the victim &apos;s hands were wiped clean ,
but i did find trace underneath the fingernails .
dna ?
uh , hopefully . it &apos;s being processed now .
so , there was also substantial bruising on the chest --
about the size and shape we &apos;d expect
if the killer was on top ,
using a knee to hold the victim down .
okay . so you &apos;ll get back to me with the trace results ?
of course .
everything okay ?
it &apos;s silly .
i just heard from the editor .
and ?
and he said that my chapters have potential ,
that the science was fascinating ,
the crime was complex .
go , maura !
well , he also said that my characters felt flat
and that the setting didn &apos;t really come alive .
all right . so you spice it up a little bit .
i don &apos;t even know how to do that .
and what does he even mean ? what am i supposed to do ?
add more more color and more smells ?
smell-- yes .
that -- that sounds like a perfect place to start .
i don &apos;t know that i should be
spending all of this time writing .
there are so many other things i could be doing .
come on , maura . you love writing .
yeah , but maybe the truth is
that i &apos;m not particularly good at it .
why ? because you didn &apos;t hit it out of the park on your first try ?
i &apos;m wrong until i &apos;m right on every murder we &apos;ve got .
okay , they &apos;re bringing in my suspect .
jane .
did you really like the chapters that you read ?
honestly . no sugarcoating .
yes . i did .
but , you know , who cares what i think ?
and who cares what that editor says ?
i mean , if you don &apos;t believe in it , then who else will ?
believe .
believe , maura !
believe !
mary ?
vincent .
my goodness . i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really you .
it &apos;s been too long .
i &apos;m so sorry about your father .
i ... i always liked him .
daddy liked you , too .
and he never liked anyof my boyfriends .
i &apos;m afraid i have to ask you some questions .
but there &apos;s no reason we have to do it there .
do you still drink tea ?
come with me .
nothing was the same after wendy died .
it was like we didn &apos;t know how to be a family without her .
i remember .
you were so sweet those first couple of months .
always coming around even when i told you not to .
i wanted to help .
but i was 18 . i didn &apos;t know how .
i &apos;m sure you remember how bad it got .
dad was falling apart , drinking .
he couldn &apos;t hold a job .
mom tried to be patient , but it was hard .
that &apos;s when mom and i moved to connecticut .
we found a 20 @-@ years @-@ sober chip in his house .
we lost him for a long time ,
but eventually , dad cleaned up his act .
after he was sober ,
he started volunteering with that victims group .
it became his whole life .
did he mention anyone he was having a problem with ?
not to me .
he ever say anything about a wayne fellows ?
we didn &apos;t really talk about his victim @-@ advocate work .
he knew it upset me .
dad never stopped thinking
about wendy and what happened to her .
he never stopped looking for her killer .
but ... i couldn &apos;t do that .
i couldn &apos;t keep dredging it up .
you did what you had to do to survive .
and now i have to do it all over again .
i don &apos;t even know a walter sokoloff .
you met him at your brother &apos;s parole hearing .
you threatened to kill him .
you mean the old man ?
is that what this is about ?
what , he file a complaint or something ?
where were you yesterday between 6 : 00 and 9 : 00 p.m. ?
why ?
because that &apos;s when walter sokoloff was murdered .
look , i said some things , but i @-@ i didn &apos;t hurt him .
i was just pissed .
yeah . we know that .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re sitting there .
you don &apos;t understand .
my brother nathan &apos;s been up for parole twice ,
and both times , the lady and the old man came .
she keeps saying all kinds of stuff about her son
so they won &apos;t let nathan out .
he murdered her son .
it was a bar fight that got out of hand .
he hates himself for it . he really does .
worrying about nathan being in jail is just killing my mom .
she doesn &apos;t eat . she barely sleeps .
i don &apos;t know how much longer ma &apos;s gonna last .
must &apos;ve made you really hate walter sokoloff --
him helping to keep your brother behind bars like that .
wait -- you said 6 : 00 to 9 : 00 ?
i was at the boathouse all night , watching the sox .
lots of people saw me .
who &apos;d they play ?
damn yankees .
we kicked their asses , too .
okay , i need some names .
so , you hadn &apos;t seen each other since you were teenagers ?
now she has grandchildren . it &apos;s crazy .
and were you two serious ?
we thought we were .
but we lost touch when she and her mother moved away .
well , it &apos;s so nice that you got to see her again .
but , what a sad reason for a reunion .
her sister &apos;s murder was the first time
i &apos;d ever been close to a crime .
it really got under my skin .
i think that &apos;s why i decided to be a cop .
hey , vince . i &apos;m sorry for interrupting .
i just wanted to make sure that it was okay with you
if i switched up my work schedule .
sure . what do you need ?
i want to free up my afternoons so i could take care of t.j.
well , you know , with ron back in the picture
and tommy and t.j. coming back , your life sounds very full .
it &apos;s never been better .
working at the robber &apos;s not fulfilling enough ?
i love my job .
i &apos;m just not getting any younger .
i want to do the things that make me happy .
yeah , kiki said i should be doing the same thing .
hey , you &apos;re the one that keeps bringing retirement up .
i just want what &apos;s best for you .
what &apos;s stopping you , vince ?
i don &apos;t know .
i just can &apos;t seem to pull the trigger .
got to go . it &apos;s jane .
okay .
sorry .
bye , hon .
see ya .
yeah , i think he wants me to be the one to push him to retire ,
but i know it &apos;s got to be his decision .
frankie confirmed wayne fellows &apos; alibi .
found at least 12 people
that said he was at the bar all night .
let &apos;s hope maura found something .
please tell us you found some dna ,
and i &apos;ll ... give you 100 bucks .
i did .
well , i &apos;m not gonna give you 100 bucks , but i &apos;m really glad .
no take @-@ backs .
we found the dna in the trace under the victim &apos;s fingernails .
you get an id ?
no , but i did get a hit when i ran it through codis .
a hit with no name ?
the dna from our crime scene
matches the dna from an unsolved homicide
that i logged into the system myself a few years ago --
the dna found on wendy &apos;s body in 1975 .
the man who killed walter sokoloff
is the same man who killed his daughter 40 years ago .
the party was at the home of carol and oliver davenport .
the davenports were old money ,
as were most of the other guests .
i thought wendy was from your neighborhood .
she was.the sokoloffs were from dorchester .
wendy was at stanover academy on a scholarship .
one of her classmates was robby davenport .
so she went to school with the rich kids .
yeah .
walter dropped her off at the party ,
but he wasn &apos;t invited to stay .
the davenports didn &apos;t associate
with people from our part of town .
wendy was killed in the garden behind the shed --
blunt @-@ force trauma to the head with a metal object .
a shovel was missing from the shed --
assumed to be the murder weapon .
the sokoloffs told us that wendy was wearing a locket
that was also missing .
detectives believed that both the shovel
and the locket were taken by the gardener .
he was our prime suspect .
he died in 1986 , so he &apos;s out .
and maura confirmed that the dna came from a caucasian male .
the adult guests were sitting around the pool
while the kids played hide @-@ and @-@ seek .
they alibied each other .
detectives also cleared two of the staff
that were working in the kitchen .
what about the kids ?
police interviewed them , but nobody saw anything .
mostly , they got a lot of crying .
let &apos;s run background checks on them as adults ,
see if anything pops .
got it .
let &apos;s also look at these three again --
oliver davenport , his two oldest sons ,
garrett and william .
this the same garrett davenport
accused of raping that nurse a few years ago ?
yes , both of the older kids
were in and out of trouble their whole lives .
well , oliver told the police that both of his sons
were in the study with him at the time of the murder .
basically , they &apos;re all each other &apos;s alibis .
oliver &apos;s been protecting his kids all their lives .
maybe he &apos;s still doing it .
but why kill her ? there &apos;s no evidence of sexual assault .
maybe wendy saw something that she wasn &apos;t supposed to see .
either way , we need to talk to them .
well , i &apos;ll see what i can dig up on the family .
i &apos;ll keep looking into walter &apos;s life --
try to figure out if he did anything
that brought wendy &apos;s killer out of hiding after all these years .
keep us updated .
this is everything from 1975 .
i performed a review several years ago ,
but i want to go over everything again .
whatever new tests have been developed , let &apos;s use them .
well , i can analyze the dirt and the hair
in the spectrophotometer .
and i can work up a virtual 3 @-@ d reconstruction of the wound .
the dress has deteriorated .
we &apos;ll be careful .
i just want to analyze any bodily fluids ,
prints , blood -- whatever it can tell us .
if we can solve one of these murders ,
we can solve both .
hey , ma .
hey , honey . how are you ? you want something to eat ?
ma , i can &apos;t stay .
did you find gram &apos;s earrings ?
i did , and i forgot
what terrible taste your great @-@ grandmother had .
ooh . wow . the stones are nice .
you sure you don &apos;t mind if i take them ?
no , i don &apos;t mind .
they &apos;ve been in my drawer for 20 years .
what are you gonna do with them ?
nothing .
not for nina ?
ma , please , just this once ,
can you not ask any questions ?
okay , fine . hey , i &apos;m not one to pry .
i &apos;m just saying that if somebody were to make a ring out of it ,
the best place to go is tony depalma .
bye , ma .
bye .
you &apos;re welcome !
菲利普斯和莱恩
would you tell them we called -- again ?
secretary says , &quot; oliver davenport isn &apos;t here .
and if you have any questions ,
you should consider submitting them in writing . &quot;
god , lawyers suck .
you want to give it another hour ?
what &apos;s that ?
oh , it &apos;s a journal i kept on the wendy sokoloff murder --
just articles , things i heard , my own suspicions .
you made this when you were a teenager ?
yeah .
i guess it was my first murder book , huh ?
i never really believed the gardener did it ,
but i couldn &apos;t find anyone else
who had a reason to kill her , either .
i was obsessed .
persistence makes a great detective .
i learned that from you .
well , you were born persistent .
hey , how you feeling about that fbi job ? you excited ?
yeah .
and then i &apos;m completely terrified .
and then i &apos;m confident
that it &apos;s the worst mistake i &apos;ve ever made .
and then -- - sounds exhausting .
it is .
it is .
you think it &apos;s the right move ?
eh . don &apos;t ask me .
i find making big decisions harder the older i get .
what does your gut tell you ?
i won &apos;t know unless i try .
i haven &apos;t known your instinct to be wrong very often .
that &apos;s not oliver , but i think that &apos;s robby davenport .
mr. davenport ?
boston pd . can we have a moment of your time ?
of course .
we &apos;ve been trying to reach your father .
we haven &apos;t had much luck .
what about ?
murder investigation .
is there a place we can talk ?
sure . come in .
god , this cannot be happening again .
do you have any idea how wendy &apos;s death affected our family ?
i imagine not nearly as much as it did the sokoloffs .
i don &apos;t mean to be insensitive .
mr. sokoloff dying is horrible .
but wendy was killed at our house , at my party .
okay ? it was devastating .
i had anxiety attacks for years afterwards .
please understand we &apos;re not trying to be insensitive ,
but it is important that we speak to your father .
dad retired shortly after my mother passed .
we &apos;re actually in the process of selling the estate .
he doesn &apos;t really see anyone anymore .
just a few questions .
dad wouldn &apos;t know anything about walter sokoloff &apos;s death .
they barely knew each other , and that was decades ago .
even so , we need to speak to him ,
and we also need to speak to william and to garrett .
my brothers ?
what do they have to do with this ?
they were at the birthday party , too .
we &apos;re just being thorough .
unfortunately , my father and my brothers are unavailable .
when your father retired ,
did it become your job to protect the davenports ?
my family has nothing to hide .
well , we could get dna samples from your father and your brothers
and then we could clear them all quickly .
if you &apos;ve got a warrant , we &apos;re happy to comply .
i &apos;m afraid i have an appointment .
my secretary will see you out .
i understand looking out for the family .
when did that include protecting murderers ?
no , no , no , no .
you want to know the worst thing
about being undercover with a bunch of neo @-@ nazis ?
i &apos;m guessing it &apos;s hard to choose the worst .
it is . but the smell .
honestly , it &apos;s like these guys never met a shower .
this probably isn &apos;t the most
romantic first @-@ date conversation .
yeah , so , how many times have you been shot ?
ugh . that was bad . sorry .
sorry . no , no , no . it &apos;s ...
i know i -- i said &quot; beer and burgers , &quot;
and this isn &apos;t beer and burgers .
no , no , no . no . it &apos;s delicious . thank you -- really .
all right , look , um ...
you &apos;re about to start a new job , all right ?
a new city , your colleagues are people you &apos;ve never met before .
it &apos;s not easy . i know .
i like you , jane .
i really like you .
i knew that from the minute we met .
but ...
but what ?
what &quot; but &quot; ? why does everyone always have a &quot; but &quot; ?
what ? it &apos;s -- it &apos;s your wife ?
your girlfriend ? your boyfriend ?
what ? what &quot; but &quot; ?
it &apos;s none of the above .
but the last thing i &apos;d ever want to do is make you feel awkward ,
start off on the wrong foot at work .
so i thought i &apos;d come here ,
tell you how i feel on your turf ,
where there &apos;s no pressure .
and if you &apos;re not interested , i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll back off ,
and i promise we will forget this conversation ever happened .
thank you .
you know , my priorities have always been family and work .
i know .
that &apos;s one of the many things i admire about you .
well , that -- that means i don &apos;t really have a lot of time
for relationships .
i understand .
you know , um ...
maybe i could make time .
five .
sorry ?
been shot five times .
you &apos;ve been shot five times ?
five times . how about you ?
i &apos;ve only been shot twice .
twice is good . twice is sexy .
no , one doesn &apos;t really count &apos; cause i shot myself .
i -- i shot myself on purpose . - what ?
yeah , well , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s a long story .
jane ! you ready ?
i -- i &apos;m cameron .
i &apos;m guessing you must be maura .
cameron .
cameron ... davies ?
agent davies ?
yeah . nice to meet you .
what a pleasant surprise .
i hope you &apos;re ... enjoying boston .
oh , yeah . um ...
very much so .
sorry , sorry .
um , okay , i just need to get my stuff .
well , don &apos;t hurry on my account .
oh . maybe i &apos;ll just hang this up for you .
looks like it didn &apos;t quite make it all the way upstairs .
um ... can we , uh , take you to your hotel ?
yeah , that &apos;d be -- that &apos;d be great , if maura doesn &apos;t mind .
oh . no , not at all .
it &apos;ll give us a chance to get to know one another .
yeah .
with your clotheson .
she &apos;s ...
on a roll today . okay .
you texted ?
is it gonna self @-@ destruct ?
actually , it &apos;s working perfectly .
i modified our facial @-@ recognition algorithm
to make a new program .
what &apos;s it doing ?
automatically registering for every sweepstakes in the nation
that gives away free trips .
you must really want to go on vacation .
you remember the missing locket that wendy wore to the party ?
yeah .
these are new @-@ item alerts .
walter created tags for a silver opal locket
on ebay and other resale sites .
they alerted him every time
a locket of that description was listed for sale .
he was looking for his daughter &apos;s missing locket .
i looked through his financial records
and found evidence that he purchased at least 12 .
the most recent was only two weeks ago .
we didn &apos;t find any in the house .
maybe the killer took them .
i &apos;ll give mary a call . maybe she knows something about it .
thanks .
hope you win your vacation .
you failed to mention that agent davies was in town .
it was just dinner .
and dessert .
actually , two desserts .
and breakfast .
he seems very nice .
yeah , he is .
is it something you think you might want to pursue in washington ?
who knows what &apos;ll happen ? but ...
yeah , i like him .
well , good for you .
um ... large brew , no room , please .
four pump , no water , soy chai with cinnamon and nutmeg .
was there even any coffeeinthat ?
don &apos;t answer . who cares ?
okay , last night , i was thinking about your book .
oh . when did you have time ?
and i think that you should just try something different .
like what ? - i don &apos;t know -- like , um ...
like a change of scenery , you know ?
like , go to the library or --
well . thank you .
... write standing up or eating ice cream , you know ?
like , mix it up a little .
that &apos;s interesting .
right ?
‭ if your pages need to &quot; come alive , &quot;
then , you know , go out and live a little .
okay , i got to run .
we &apos;re gonna take another shot
at trying to talk to oliver davenport .
i got this .
thank you .
and , hey , don &apos;t give up . okay ?
that &apos;s not the dr. isles i know .
see ya .
i &apos;m sorry . mr. davenport isn &apos;t taking visitors .
yeah , we just need a few minutes .
you can arrange an appointment through his office .
so what now ?
we can &apos;t talk to the family .
we don &apos;t have enough for a warrant to get the davenports &apos; dna .
we &apos;re not getting any further than they did back in &apos; 75 .
that must be the service entrance that korsak was talking about .
looks like they &apos;re moving stuff out .
yeah . you can &apos;t just walk in there .
i can if i &apos;m invited .
you got a jacket ?
how &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s perfect .
you know what i just realized ?
this might be one of the last cases that we work together .
oh , no .
come on . i could become part of some fbi task force .
i &apos;ll swoop in and make your life a living hell .
oh , just like when we were kids .
exactly .
jane .
i wouldn &apos;t be a detective if it wasn &apos;t for you .
you know that , right ?
you did that on your own , frankie .
that was all you .
be right back .
all right .
everything must be handled with meticulous care .
they &apos;ll need more blankets .
can you grab those and take them in ?
these ?
yes , please .
take them inside , all the way to the back .
the statues are in the salon .
here you go , mr. davenport .
i &apos;ll get some water and be right back .
mr. davenport ?
hi . my name is jane rizzoli .
i &apos;d like to ... ask you a few questions .
carol ?
no , no , no . uh , my name is jane .
you &apos;re here .
can i help you ?
i &apos;m detective rizzoli from boston police department .
i was hoping to speak to mr. davenport ,
but i see that &apos;s not really possible .
i &apos;m afraid he &apos;s getting worse .
carol ?
i &apos;ve missed you .
i missed you , too .
may i ?
of course .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
‭ it &apos;s okay .
i have to go , but i &apos;m gonna come back , okay ?
okay ?
thanks .
of course .
maura processed oliver davenport &apos;s dna .
it &apos;s a familial match to our killer &apos;s .
so our murderer was definitely one of the davenports .
i just heard back from ice .
garrett &apos;s passport was scanned leaving the country the morning
after walter was killed .
he may be running .
i &apos;ll start a warrant for garrett and william &apos;s
phone numbers and credit cards .
that &apos;s mary .
i asked her to look for the lockets that walter bought .
okay , um , frankie , will you get in touch with interpol ,
have them keep tabs on garrett .
already on it .
but with the money these guys have ,
they could be anywhere .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll find him .
she found a key to a safety @-@ deposit box .
i &apos;m meeting her at the bank .
no lockets ?
no .
she told me earlier that none of the family
even knew where that locket came from .
they didn &apos;t give it to her ?
no .
first time walter saw it was
when he dropped wendy off at the party .
she told him it was a gift .
from who ?
she wouldn &apos;t say .
she jumped out of the car and ran off to
join the other kids before walter got an answer .
can you handle that warrant ?
yeah , sure . go on .
dr. isles .
we &apos;re ready to begin the tests .
kent , would you feel comfortable
managing the m.e. &apos; s office for a few weeks if the need arose ?
of course .
are you planning on going somewhere ?
i &apos;m not sure .
let &apos;s see what this dress can tell us .
she sounds wonderful .
oh , kiki &apos;s the best .
i don &apos;t know how she ended up with me .
oh , stop . i think she &apos;s a very lucky woman .
it &apos;s exciting , isn &apos;t it ?
you and kiki , me with my grandkids .
it &apos;s like a whole new chapter of our lives is just starting .
all the paperwork seems to be in order .
if i could just get your signature here ...
very good .
box 1263 .
do you have the key ?
uh , yes .
thank you .
i &apos;ll give you some privacy .
i told you .
he never stopped looking .
he tracked the ownership of the lockets back through years .
hoping it would lead him to wendy &apos;s murderer .
these look like purchase dates on the front .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nina said he bought a locket two weeks ago .
it &apos;s on the list , but it &apos;s not here .
that &apos;s why he was killed , wasn &apos;t it ?
daddy did it .
he finally found the right locket .
what &apos;s going on ?
you &apos;re just in time .
okay , let me guess-- you built a time machine ,
and we &apos;re gonna go back to 1975 and solve the crime .
you know , jane , it &apos;s your sarcasm i &apos;m gonna miss most of all .
but actually , you &apos;re not far from wrong .
we &apos;re performing a vacuum metal deposition test on the dress .
the vmd technology &apos;s only been available in the past few years .
vmd has the potential to lift prints from surfaces
that were impossible to analyze at the time of the murder .
like fabric .
exactly .
sorry .
now , first , we will expose the dress to an aerosol of evaporated gold .
real gold ?
yes .
now , the secondary exposure is to evaporated zinc .
the zinc will attach itself to the gold anywhere that
there might be prints .
and then ... nothing happens .
wait for it .
it worked .
those don &apos;t look like a man &apos;s prints .
no .
they look like a little boy &apos;s prints .
a kid did this to another kid ?
maura confirmed the prints match robert davenport &apos;s .
good thing prints don &apos;t change as you age .
not for robert davenport .
i told you he &apos;s not in today !
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know , but if he calls , i can tell--
this is a homicide investigation .
if i find out you withheld anything from us ,
i swear to you i will make it my personal mission
to see you behind bars .
security called and told mr. davenport
that you were coming up .
he went out back .
where &apos;d he go ?
uh , h @-@ he told me to make sure
that the company helicopter was prepared for takeoff .
where is that ?
jackson airfield .
it &apos;s just a couple -- - we know where it is .
notify the state police air wing to get a unit in the air now !
we &apos;re gonna lose him .
shit !
there he is -- straight ahead !
get us in the air !
put it down !
go ! go !
boston police .
return to the ground and surrender your passenger .
come on ! get us in the air !
i repeat -- surrender your passenger .
put it down !
you have the right to an attorney .
if you cannot afford an attorney ,
one will be provided for you .
do you understand these rights as i &apos;ve read them to you ?
i &apos;ll take that as a &quot; yes . &quot;
officer .
looks like that persistence finally paid off .
you were right .
yay ! i was right !
i love being right !
what was i right about ?
all of it --
not giving up on being a writer , mixing it up .
good ! so you &apos;re gonna finish writing the book ?
i am . and i &apos;m taking your advice .
i think a change of scenery is exactly what i need .
my editor wants the book to come alive ,
and i know just how to do it .
i &apos;m going to paris for a month .
paris ?
of course .
i mean , the whole book takes place in france .
so i &apos;ll soak up the atmosphere , live among the people .
i didn &apos;t actually mean a library ... in france
when i suggested it .
but great ! that sounds great .
i &apos;m so excited .
hi , maura .
hello .
i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re canceling dinner .
yeah . just got called out to advise on a case .
i &apos;m on a plane for philly in an hour .
yeah , the monkey suit kind of gave it away , so ...
sorry .
i can honestly tell you there &apos;s nothing
i &apos;d rather be doing than having dinner with you .
rain check ?
yeah .
yeah , it &apos;ll be my treat -- in washington .
it &apos;s a date .
okay .
i &apos;ll , uh ...

the best beer and burgers in town .
