my father was an innocent man ,
destroyed by powerful people .
the graysons are behind this , and they &apos;re gonna pay .
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to avenging his death ...
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
and i won &apos;t stop
until they &apos;ve all paid the price .
he showed up the night of conrad &apos;s election .
i had no doubt that he was my firstborn .
margaux lemarchal .
pascal lemarchal &apos;s daughter .
i &apos;m a fan of all of his publications ,
especially &quot; voulez . &quot;
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve moved here--
to start the american version .
you have huntington &apos;s disease , governor .
you &apos;re responsible for what happened to conrad today , aren &apos;t you ?
i will let them suffer .
these are terrible people doing terrible things .
finish this , then leave for good ,
or i &apos;ll tell everyone the truth .
let &apos;s get married before the end of the summer .
what are you doing here ?
same thing as you--
looking to destroy the girl next door .
it is believed that original sin
can only be cleansed by the waters of baptism .
but it is the sins that follow
that are not so easily washed away .
and since forgiveness of trespass
is only granted to the truly penitent ,
pure evil can never be erased .
we &apos;re miles away from prying eyes .
i think we can proceed .
proceed with exactly what , mr. mathis ?
three days ago , you re @-@ emerge ,
claiming a vendetta against emily thorne .
i don &apos;t usually trust people who tell me
exactly what i want to hear .
you &apos;re not the only one who wants emily to suffer .
well , that &apos;s rather extreme , considering the two of you had
what amounted to a summer fling .
our history predates the hamptons .
there &apos;s a great deal about that girl you don &apos;t know .
so now we get to the heart of the matter--
you &apos;re in love with her .
she betrayed me in a way you couldn &apos;t even imagine .
or maybe you can ...
as i &apos;m sure david clarke &apos;s treachery lit a fire inside you .
do not make inferences to my past ,
nor try to compel me by straining to link david
with whatever emily is up to .
don &apos;t be so sure .
once upon a time ...
david clarke attempted to destroy your livelihood .
and now you &apos;ve lost it
at the hands of emily and nolan ross .
neither one of them has a monetary concern in the world .
a scammer like emily has , uh , other motives .
why should i believe you ?
because i did it with them .
but the moment they got what they wanted ,
i was summarily cast out .
so i want emily to feel that same kind of betrayal ,
which means only one thing-- teaming up with you .
we can make her pay , victoria .
but you &apos;re gonna have to trust me .
trust is difficult without proof .
well , then you &apos;ll have it .
is the &quot; voulez &quot; ?
wow . margaux must have made quite the impression
to get you to read what you called ,
&quot; a rag about nothing but dresses and hair . &quot;
i shouldn &apos;t have judged this magazine by its cover .
you know , it turns out they have
some significant political and cultural pieces , too .
why the sudden interest ?
well , you know , instead of going crazy
waiting around for my huntington &apos;s test results ,
i &apos;m grabbing the taureau by the horns
and having dinner with margaux at muse tonight .
i want to help her run &quot; voulez . &quot;
you really think you could do this ?
well , i &apos;ve always dreamt of having a job
where i could be more creative .
i just have to bone up on piping and scoop necks .
unless , of course , my fashion @-@ fluent
fianceé was by my side .
of course .
i &apos;ll call muse and make it dinner for three .
you &apos;re perfect .
that &apos;s it .
three days of moping in the dark is the legal limit .
i am not moping .
i am avoiding the telephoto lenses
trying to document how they think the mighty have fallen ,
which i most certainly have not .
booze in the morning looks a lot like denial , dad .
so does moving out at your father &apos;s expense .
look , you &apos;re here every day ,
so why not just save yourself the commute
from your friends &apos; couches ?
well , first of all , they have guest houses .
and i might have to move back
just to keep a drink out of your hand .
i &apos;m getting you through this , whether you want me to or not .
you know , i may have used up all my good luck on you ...
and it was worth it .
tell my driver where ,
and he &apos;ll be happy to provide you with your drive of shame , or ...
fame .
bye ....
you .
not even learning names now ?
less mess .
especially after my p.t.s.d.--
padma , tyler , sexual damage .
just be careful who you let come and go .
until i find daniel a job in the city ...
i need to be able to trust you with this .
i had a feeling you &apos;d be uncapping
that red sharpie now that jack set a deadline .
so ... who &apos;s next to get got with red on their face ?
paul whitley .
he was in charge of enticing investors to grayson global .
my father saw him holding closed @-@ door meetings with everyone who eventually betrayed him .
so conrad used paul &apos;s silver tongue
to sway the undecided ?
i always wondered how so many people
turned against a man as good as your dad .
now you have your answer .
and i have my next challenge .
why ?
is he ... some untouchable c.e.o. ?
he works for an even higher power .
father paul ?
you must be emily .
so nice to finally put a face to a name .
i could say the same .
this is my fiancé daniel grayson .
conrad and victoria &apos;s son ?
yeah .
i used to work for your father a long time ago .
at grayson global ?
mm .
wow , what a coincidence .
i don &apos;t believe much in coincidence .
couldn &apos;t agree more , father .
then i did some missionary work overseas
before being assigned to st. francis .
that &apos;s quite a radical shift from the corporate life .
why did you do it ?
well , i was there for the david clarke scandal .
and when he died in prison ,
it really hit me what greed can do to a soul .
so i looked out my office window and all the way uptown ,
and i knew that there were millions of souls
on the street , tormented , that i could help
in ways that i hadn &apos;t helped him .
so i quit grayson global , joined the seminary ,
and ten years later , here we are .
i &apos;m sorry . i heard about your father &apos;s huntington &apos;s diagnosis .
how are your parents holding up ?
well , as good as could be expected , i guess .
i take it you &apos;re not in touch with them anymore .
they weren &apos;t exactly happy with my exit from the firm .
well , since you &apos;re officiating ,
maybe this was meant to be .
hey , father , do you-- do you mind ?
oh , go ahead .
t @-@ try her out , take her out for a test drive ,
see how she feels .
my gut tells me you aren &apos;t the girl
that dreamt of a big church wedding .
yeah , i guess i just ...
always imagined something much simpler .
the graysons do pull you into their world , don &apos;t they ?
something like that .
imagine the look on his face when he sees you come down this aisle .
it &apos;ll be a dream come true .
so what do you think ?
people gonna miss the salisbury steak ?
as someone who &apos;s had it , no .
hey , charlotte .
that &apos;s &quot; aunt &quot; charlotte . can you say that ?
i didn &apos;t know you were coming by .
i &apos;m just making my rounds .
i check in on dad to lift his spirits ,
and then lift mine with this cute face .
oh , carl .
calms him down every time .
amanda was beautiful .
and there &apos;s declan .
i keep thinking back to the last time i spoke to him .
it &apos;s okay , charlotte .
i still can &apos;t believe they &apos;re gone .
and now dad &apos;s dying .
how can such bad things happen to good people ?
mr. grayson , please .
come on in .
paul .
it &apos;s been a long time , victoria .
i was under the impression
that i had laid eyes on you for the last time years ago .
trust me , i had no intention of ever seeing you or conrad again .
the lord works in mysterious ways .
you don &apos;t know ?
daniel and emily have asked me to preside over their wedding .
tell me you &apos;re not considering it .
i feel it &apos;s the right thing to do .
it &apos;s the reason i &apos;m here .
why ?
to shame us over events best relegated to history ?
to help put them to rest .
well , while i appreciate your arrogance ,
i &apos;m doing just fine , thank you .
i wish i could say the same for conrad .
well , you &apos;re welcome to take a run at him .
but he &apos;s always viewed god as a competitor .
hey , boss .
well , i haven &apos;t been your boss since you quit
sometime last century .
unless , of course , you weren &apos;t talking to me ,
in which case , you should be aware
that he is not here .
no , i &apos;m here to see you , conrad .
and i think you may need me .
oh , please , do spare me the pious priest act .
the paul i knew could sell ice to an eskimo
and not be afraid to get his hands filthy in the doing of it .
i &apos;m the same guy .
just selling something of higher value .
selling ?
oh , god , of course , that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
look , i think you have been
more than adequately compensated for your silence .
you don &apos;t need to remind me
of something that still torments me .
well , i could have tried to tell you
that collar wasn &apos;t gonna do you any good .
and i &apos;m glad i didn &apos;t listen .
well ...
hey , whatever you need to sleep at night ,
but , you know , don &apos;t forget that unlike your flock ,
i know firsthand that that soul of yours
is ... far from unblemished .
i asked for forgiveness . i found peace in my penance .
and i &apos;m here to suggest that your huntington &apos;s
is the lord &apos;s way of forcing you to do the same--
to atone for your sins .
look , i will not impute to genetic anomaly
with the acts of a vengeful deity .
this is a matter of science , not religion , father .
you can believe me or not .
but i &apos;ve seen a lot of people suffer .
and when they do , it causes them ...
to look at who they &apos;ll be when they die .
the act of acknowledging your sins is terrifying .
but i &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s better to be
honestly unhappy than dishonestly so .
well ...
then you know what ? i &apos;d like to confess
that i am honestly unhappy that you &apos;re here .
okay .
you can make fun .
but times like these require support .
and something tells me you &apos;re alone in this room
because you may not have it .
we may no longer see eye @-@ to @-@ eye ,
but i &apos;ll always be here for you .
so you can imagine my shock when a man parachutes
into the first party i attend here .
nolan ross does know how to get attention .
mm , and for good reason . he &apos;s brilliant .
unpredictable .
on the cutting edge of fashion .
now you ask me ,
ross is what led to my father &apos;s collapse .
well , then maybe we should ship him off
to meet mine .
well , at least your father gave you permission
to bring &quot; voulez &quot; to the states .
the name is the extent of pascal &apos;s generosity .
if papa had his way , his only daughter
would join the board of a charity and get married .
it &apos;s not so bad , really .
oh , my goodness . no , no , no .
i @-@ i meant nothing by that . no , no , i &apos;m sorry . oh , no .
no , i think i &apos;m just preoccupied with matters at hand--
finding reliable advertisers ...
and investors with deep pockets .
or you could just hire someone to do that for you .
with my business experience ,
we can make a good run at this .
my father attributes two of his divorces
to the demands of &quot; voulez . &quot;
i , of course , attribute it to my father .
but i couldn &apos;t live with myself
if i took away your first years of marriage .
i couldn &apos;t live with myself
if i prevented him from pursuing a dream .
why don &apos;t i leave you two to talk ?
excuse me .
charlotte ?
nice to see you here .
i came here to surprise daniel and margaux ,
but you know what they say-- &quot; four &apos;s a crowd . &quot;
is something wrong ?
you were the only person i told
about my mother &apos;s supposed affair .
next thing i know ,
it &apos;s gotten back to her through ashley .
i didn &apos;t say a word .
ashley must have found out some other way .
i mean , you know how nosy she is .
you know , i used to defend you when my mother would
go on one of her emily rants ,
but now i think i &apos;ll stay quiet .
charlotte , i understand that you &apos;re upset ,
but i didn &apos;t do it .
and anyway , it &apos;s just a little bit of gossip .
a little bit of gossip ?
maybe you don &apos;t get that even one tiny lie
can cause a lot of damage .
charlotte , please .
you were one of the few people left in my life
i felt connected to .
and now i don &apos;t know if i can trust you anymore .
so thanks for the concern ,
but no , thanks .
hey , perfect timing , ems .
i picked up a new hobby working in the prison kitchen .
see , it turns out that , uh , blueberry muffins
can calm even the most sociopathic heart .
i should have one .
first i lose jack for telling the truth ,
then i lose charlotte for lying .
then take a breather .
especially since the guy on deck is not only a priest ,
but practically the mother teresa of the bronx .
got a library card in lieu of wi @-@ fi .
every other takedown
had histories that read like rap sheets , but ...
all signs point to paul being a good man .
well , my father was a better man .
right . the gospel according to emily--
sin unto others as you &apos;ve had sinned unto you .
right .
this time , i just--
i kinda think you &apos;re going too far .
if--if you cannot forgive paul ,
how do you expect to be forgiven ?
i don &apos;t .
look , i have two months before the wedding ,
which means i &apos;m not pulling any punches .
just check your soul , emily thorne ,
&apos;cause once you start taking down kittens ,
i &apos;m out .
unhand my painting this instant .
uh , pay no mind to the lady of the house , gentlemen .
as you were .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
i was under the impression that you had
at least a few more months before dementia kicked in .
charming .
maintaining stables ,
standing suites at the south fork ,
and our yacht you &apos;ve suddenly grown fond of again ,
actually costs money .
auctioning off one of the pieces
from your collection this afternoon
will keep us afloat ... for june .
oh , and when , pray tell ,
will you be sacrificing your ferrari ?
we can discuss that in july . unless , of course ,
you &apos;ve suddenly found our stolen millions ?
july it is .
miss thorne .
i decided to do some baking .
i thought i &apos;d ... share .
they &apos;re blueberry .
that &apos;s my favorite . how considerate ...
and ironic that my wife is
the only woman in this family who doesn &apos;t care about me .
excuse me .
well , i met your officiant today ,
or i should say &quot; re @-@ met . &quot;
i really wish that you would clear such things with me .
oh , forgive me , victoria , but when i heard that
you and father paul had a history ,
i saw an opportunity to mend another fence .
another ?
well , like patrick .
i imagine you want him to be a part of our perfect day .
oh , you &apos;re kind to pour sugar on that wound ,
but i prefer to keep him separate .
oh , well , i suppose patrick &apos;s used to it .
that is a shame , though . i &apos;ve never seen you so happy .
but considering your family &apos;s current state ,
i understand . who knows how they &apos;d react ?
well , you &apos;re busy . i should go .
put that painting back .
i have another piece in mind .
they like you .
you know , this is
where sammy came running up to you a couple years ago .
sometimes i wonder
what would have happened if i hadn &apos;t brought him to the park that day .
i understand how you feel , jack .
do you ?
&apos;cause it keeps changing for me ...
every time charlotte comes by .
i hate myself for going along with this .
that &apos;s actually why i stopped
when i saw you . i ...
i &apos;m worried about her .
well , so am i , but what can i do ?
you &apos;re the source of most of her pain .
unless you &apos;re here to give me permission
to tell her the truth .
i can &apos;t do that , jack .
not before the end of the summer , right ?
she won &apos;t talk to me ,
but i know something &apos;s not right .
i was just hoping that maybe you would speak with her .
you really refuse to accept responsibility , don &apos;t you ?
she &apos;s your sister .
tell me , when exactly did punishing the guilty
become more important to you than helping the innocent ?
i gotta tell ya ,
i was shocked to hear that fontana &apos;s &quot; monsoon no.2 &quot;
was on the block .
patrick .
now why are you offering this up to these vultures , huh ?
i mean , you love this piece .
yes , i do .
but the truth is we &apos;re , um ...
we &apos;re having financial troubles .
and now that conrad &apos;s had to step down from office ...
why didn &apos;t you say something ?
you &apos;re going to think me shallow ,
but the world i live in ,
if they sense this vulnerability ,
they will use it as a weapon .
so ... i part with the things i love .
still not an easy sacrifice to make , right ?
it &apos;s easier than some others .
well , quite frankly ,
the final chance to see this piece
is not why i came by .
well , that &apos;s why i chose the fontana--
because i knew you &apos;d come .
never doubt those instincts of yours .
you know , they &apos;re always spot on .
i know that my daughter came to see you ,
and it says a lot about her .
and it says a lot about you for protecting her .
it &apos;s okay .
family &apos;s complicated .
but my feelings for you are simple .
and i am never going to
let another day pass without you in it .
this is father paul .
father , i need your help .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
hello ?
father paul whitley .
are you here ?
a pleasure to finally meet you , ms. lemarchal .
oh , all mine , mr. johnson .
richard , please .
bonsoir , mademoiselle .
et monsieur .
thanks , richard . appreciate it .
thank you .
thank you .
okay , first you find me enough investors
that i can actually afford a nice office space .
then get the man who made &quot; page six &quot;
interested in working with us ...
in the course of one day .
so when do i start ?
i don &apos;t remember offering you the job .
oh , but you were about to .
what &apos;s the reason we &apos;re not staying in these offices ?
my father &apos;s name is on the building .
and he made it clear my presence here is temporary .
too bad . i could get used to a view like this .
this calls for celebration .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;ve been summoned to southampton tonight .
hmm . you still have a little time .
come to borrow a cup of vinegar ?
no , i wanted to drop these off
and welcome you to the neighborhood .
we didn &apos;t get a chance to talk the other day
after that little stunt of yours .
well , i couldn &apos;t wait to be surrounded by
nothing but air after having been locked up
for six months .
and after your recent legal issues ,
how fortunate you were able to purchase this place .
i know how long it takes to thaw frozen assets .
in fact , i &apos;m certain someone with your technological prowess
would have no trouble accessing bank accounts ,
whether they belong to you or not .
although i love a good shower of praise ,
victoria , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed .
but , uh , my life is a computer @-@ free zone these days .
oh , i see you &apos;ve made room for other things .
now what could have made you part with such a masterpiece ?
and who knew you to be such an art connoisseur ?
well , i ... dabble .
in many things , no doubt .
some , quite possibly , unforgivable .
i should leave you to get settled .
charlotte .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
listen , i &apos;m sorry for what happened yesterday .
it &apos;s fine . let &apos;s just enjoy dinner , shall we ?
your meetings must have went well .
yeah .
i waited for you at the house , but i didn &apos;t want to be late .
well , you know what the traffic &apos;s like
getting out of the city .
so ... was margaux interested ?
she made an offer . i told her i &apos;d sleep on it .
a job with a monthly publication ?
i thought you &apos;d want a little stability .
just worry about yourself right now , okay ?
oh , yeah , yeah . echoing the universal sentiment
that huntington &apos;s should occupy 100 % of my thoughts .
or maybe it &apos;s just that it &apos;s everyone &apos;s eloquent way
of not having to heed my opinions .
well , i &apos;d like to know how you &apos;re feeling , dad .
pretty much the same , sweetheart . thank you .
any idea why your mother
has called this de facto family summit ?
to introduce you to someone special .
who &apos;s this ?
our brother .
i gotta say i do miss the fountain in the stairwell .
oh , wow . well @-@ versed in modernists
and well @-@ acquainted with my home .
you are just full of surprises , mr. osbourne .
he was living here .
of course he was .
so no job ?
well , patrick is a freelance artist .
oh , freelancing &apos;s not a profession , dear .
it &apos;s a hobby one has between bartending shifts .
and i could use another drink .
you &apos;ve had enough .
i &apos;ll get it .
you know , after &quot; nightline , &quot; letters poured in from leeches
claiming to be her son .
how do we know you &apos;re not one of them ?
i have the , uh ...
i could have swor-- you know what i did ?
i left the d.n.a. test in my other jacket .
he &apos;s funny . well ...
don &apos;t think you &apos;ve hit the jackpot , buddy ,
&apos;cause we &apos;re broke .
patrick is apprised of our situation .
and as difficult as it may be for any of you to believe ,
there &apos;s some people driven by motivations other than financial gain .
you know , perhaps patrick can float us a loan
from what &apos;s left of the $ 5 million .
i mean , that is how you sustain a life .
thank you , uh , freelancing , i imagine .
what are you talking about ?
when patrick here was of age ,
he came and searched for his mother .
and our general factotum , frank , paid him that tidy sum
to ... disappear .
the guy &apos;s name was frank ?
well , frank showed up ...
but he only threatened to hurt me .
i never saw a cent of that money .
and no offense , mr. grayson ,
but my only fear coming into tonight was that
you &apos;d try to sic him on me again .
then i have two happy pieces of news to share .
first off , poor frank is deceased .
and i wasn &apos;t the one who sent him .
that &apos;d be your dear old mum .
you did that ?
it &apos;s true .
excuse me .
no ! wait .
when you came looking for me ,
i suddenly became that scared teenage girl again .
and i made the same mistake .
and i &apos;ve only just begun
to make up for what i &apos;ve been missing .
and i swear to you that i will go to my grave
to try to atone for those sins .
now ...
patrick has done nothing wrong .
and for you to treat him like this
is not only unwarranted . it is unacceptable .
he is good , and he is genuine .
and i will be damned if i sit here
and let you drag him down to your level .
he is my son , and that makes him family .
well , then , here &apos;s ...
conrad , are you all right ?
aah ! damn it !
look what you &apos;ve done , mother .
god , how can you be so selfish ?
springing patrick on us and riling dad up .
he &apos;s sick , and you could care less .
charlotte--
patrick , if i were you , i &apos;d get out before it &apos;s too late .
i still can &apos;t believe my mother chose
to trot patrick out yesterday .
well , i &apos;m sure she had her reasons .
why do i even care ?
my parents are rotten human beings
who continually disappoint me .
and yet i have this innate need to protect them .
because despite everything , they &apos;re your family .
and when someone comes along and threatens that bond ,
you &apos;ll do anything to defend it .
is that why you haven &apos;t mentioned the job--
because it &apos;s in the city ?
the job ?
you should take it , daniel .
i &apos;ll be here to make sure that patrick doesn &apos;t interfere too much ,
and besides , i &apos;m sure margaux is counting on you .
she can handle herself , believe me .
i &apos;m just--i &apos;m just not sure it &apos;s for me .
well , i &apos;ll leave it up to you ,
but just consider it , okay ?
okay .
i &apos;ll see you later .
morning , patrick .
emily . what are you doing here ?
well , i had a meeting with my wedding planner ,
and she canceled last minute .
then i remembered that you were staying here .
i know that if i were you ,
i &apos;d want to talk to somebody after last night .
the graysons can be quite a handful .
i &apos;m well aware of your history with my mother and her family . so ...
i can handle myself .
please ... hey ! carl .
hey ! carl ! hey .
it looks like someone &apos;s in a mood .
he &apos;s been fussy all afternoon .
i tried to feed him , i gave him a toy ,
i even tried the wedding video .
come here , come here .
nothing i did was good enough .
oh , buddy .
he &apos;s just tired . he &apos;s just tired .
yeah , tired of his auntie .
clearly i &apos;m not fit for motherhood .
what ?
you &apos;re being too hard on yourself .
no , i &apos;m not .
you don &apos;t know what i &apos;ve done , and i can &apos;t help but thinking
it &apos;s the universe &apos;s way of paying me back .
what are you talking about ?
if i had just told declan where i was instead of lying ,
he wouldn &apos;t have come looking for me at grayson global .
his death is all my fault .
charlotte ...
you &apos;ve been blaming yourself this whole time ?
it &apos;s nothing to do with--
jack , don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t deserve your pity .
i &apos;m the reason your brother &apos;s gone .
charlotte , wait .
there &apos;s something you need to know .
so your instincts about turning patrick
were a little off .
kinda makes you want to reconsider
taking down father paul , doesn &apos;t it ?
tell me you didn &apos;t call me here
to talk me out of it .
just finishing a little home improvement project .
nice , nolan .
and ... that &apos;s not all .
what are you doing ?
&quot; all i ask is that you promise to do
&quot; the one thing that i was never able to do . &quot;
nolan .
&quot; forgive .
&quot; keeping hate for the people who betrayed me
&quot; has brought nothing but torment and heartache .
you deserve better than that , amanda . you deserve love . &quot;
don &apos;t you ever go through my things again .
do you understand me ?
i brought you into this
because i thought you loved my father .
i do love him , and i love his daughter .
and i want to protect her .
i don &apos;t need your protection , nolan .
wha--circumstances change , ems .
you probably didn &apos;t think
you were gonna tell jack the truth ...
until this was all over . but look what happened .
so maybe--maybe the best @-@ laid plans
are sometimes meant to be abandoned !
maybe they &apos;re meant to be carried out alone .
oh , there &apos;s my girl .
i am not your girl .
you know , despite all the horrible things
i heard about flight 197
and what you did to my actual father ,
i hoped it wasn &apos;t true , that you couldn &apos;t be that evil .
uh , what are you saying ?
you knew about the bomb that killed declan .
who told you that ?
do you have any idea how guilty i feel over his death ?
from the moment it happened , i blamed myself .
it made me sick , and i know that &apos;s why i miscarried .
oh , charlotte , sweetheart , that--
you watched me suffer ,
while you sat on your throne in the governor &apos;s mansion .
i &apos;m done helping you .
please , don &apos;t do this .
you deserve to die miserable and alone .
&quot; our father , who art in heaven ,
&quot; hallowed be thy name .
&quot; they kingdom come , thy will be done ,
&quot; on earth as it is in heaven .
&quot; give us this day our daily bread ,
&quot; and forgive us our trespasses
&quot; as we forgive those who trespass against us .
&quot; and lead us not into temptation ,
&quot; but deliver us from evil .
&quot; for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory ,
forever . amen . &quot;
amen .
amen .
and the next thing i know ,
someone cracked me over the head .
and i wake up an hour later with an empty wallet
and a killer headache .
that &apos;s terrible . what did the police say ?
oh , i didn &apos;t call them .
whoever did it needed what i had more than i did .
let &apos;s talk about your wedding .
well , i ...
i hear you saw my future in @-@ laws .
i did ... until conrad practically threw me out .
i only hope he heard a little of what i had to say .
i don &apos;t understand . why wouldn &apos;t he ?
in truth ,
the mistakes that we made-- in large part--
are why i changed my life
and try to change those of others .
hopefully , i &apos;ll make a better impression
on your parents , emily .
i lost my parents when i was young .
i &apos;m sorry . it must be difficult planning a wedding
knowing that your father won &apos;t be there
to walk you down the aisle .
yeah .
if he were still here ,
i know that he would be proud of the woman that you &apos;ve become ,
and getting all the happiness
that he must have wanted for you .
i &apos;m sorry , father .
well , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s all right .
when one loses a parent at a young age ,
they miss out on a whole lifetime of unconditional love .
lucky for you ,
i know where you can find a little extra .
hey .
daniel .
look , uh , about yesterday ...
i &apos;m sorry .
obviously , i was mistaken .
the old daniel wouldn &apos;t have hesitated .
now the new daniel picks up my dress and hands it to me .
that &apos;s a first .
and i assume he also has the class
to decline a job in person ?
let me choose the &quot; voulez &quot; office location ,
and i &apos;ll take the job .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it .
well , you &apos;d be doing me a favor .
where do you have in mind ?
montauk .
you want to make a splash , we gotta be trailblazers .
plus i have some holdings there
completely rent @-@ free and ready for rehab .
and it allows you to be close to your fiancee ?
it does let me be nearer to my family , yeah .
and all the power players we want relationships with--
that &apos;s where they summer , too .
this new daniel grayson drives a hard bargain .
exactly what i &apos;m looking for in a publisher .
i started collecting food for the homeless on holidays ...
when i first came to the parish , but ...
father paul .
hey !
now it &apos;s just grown exponentially .
i &apos;m hoping when i become pastor ,
i &apos;ll find a bigger place , feed more people .
oh , christina !
oh , my goodness .
here you go .
thanks .
so cool !
overwhelming , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , it is .
thank you , father .
excuse me . there &apos;s something i have to go do .
pastor , how are you ?
not good , paul . we need to talk .
i don &apos;t understand . this makes no sense .
aiden ?
checking up on my story about nolan ross , were you ?
don &apos;t go behind my back .
i won &apos;t have you jeopardize my plans .
until you earn my trust , mr. mathis ,
i will take matters into my own hands .
as i suspected ,
nolan is clearly hidding somethig .
he &apos;s merely a paw ...
lile i was .
the deed ... to nolan &apos;s house ...
with emily &apos;s name on it .
she has your fortune .
what now ?
now you do something for me .
i &apos;m sorry , dad .
conrad ?
emily ?
i guess it &apos;s true what they say ,
bride &apos;s work is never done .
i haven &apos;t been in a sanctuary like this since ...
i was an altar boy .
are you here to see father paul ?
no , no . why do you ask ?
he and i got off on the wrong foot yesterday .
i got off the wrong foot yesterday , with him , with patrick ...
others i care about .
is he in his office ?
i &apos;m afraid he is gone .
there was an incident .
he left st. francis .
i &apos;ve always deemed karma a concept created
to lift the spirits of the unaccomplished ,
but recent events have given me pause .
i &apos;ve always believed in the natural balance of things .
we reap what we sow .
then harvest may be upon me , miss thorne .
it &apos;s time for me to face the punishment for my sins .
i &apos;m sorry . please excuse my senseless prattle .
i should have accepted paul &apos;s ear when i had the chance .
isn &apos;t there anyone else you could talk to ?
i fear i have no one left to listen .
i suppose i should take that , too , as a sign .
good night , emily .
come for this ?
no .
you were right .
i knew you hadn &apos;t gone full dark side . so ...
you stopped the takedown ?
i tried . it was too late .
well , what are you gonna do ?
fix it .
because i think father paul can do the one thing
i haven &apos;t be able to .
convince conrad to confess ...
to everything .
