you &apos;re gonna flirt --
talk . i &apos;m gonna talk to them .
and then you &apos;re gonna walk across a stage
while these women are bidding on you .
el , my chances of being picked
are slim to none between neal and --

there &apos;s gonna be a very big problem , though .
what &apos;s that ?
all the women are gonna want you ,
so what happens when your killer gets outbid ?
i see your point . mm @-@ hmm .
you &apos;re gonna have to throw your meetings
with all the other women .
how do i do that ?
well , we are very shallow creatures ,
but there are things that
even beautiful men like you do
that drive us nuts .
oh , you &apos;re good .
all right , honey , let &apos;s go over this again .
you are ...
peter williams , u.s. steel magnate .
mm . and tell me more about the steel industry .
well , it began as a family business .
by then ...
boring , boring , boring .
what did we discuss ?
right .
uh , you don &apos;t want to hear about what i do .
i really want to know more about you .
mm . and why are you still single ?
haven &apos;t found the right woman yet .
mm . who might this right woman be ?
oh , well , she &apos;s about 5 &apos; 5 , &quot;
brunette ,
most beautiful blue eyes i &apos;ve ever seen ,
smart as a whip ,
and gorgeous as hell .
aww . perfect .
okay . remember , this is a conversation ,
not an interrogation ,
so you got to move away from the &quot; where are you froms &quot;
and &quot; what do you dos &quot;
and , honey , don &apos;t make that face .
what face ?
that face .
oh . right . yes .
be yourself . you &apos;re gonna be great .
okay .
thanks , hon .
bye .
see ya .
have we , uh , met ?
i don &apos;t believe we have .
arthur fort , pastry baron to
a multimillion @-@ dollar dessert empire .
ladies love the sweets .
you ready ?
are you ?
gentlemen , we are about to begin .
i will make the announcement ,
and when i give you the go @-@ ahead ,
you just take your places on the stairs , okay ?
good luck .
okay , ladies , i have only one question for you !
are you ready to meet your men ?
why do i feel like i need a pike and sword ?
for those about to date ...
we salute you .
okay , ladies ,
you &apos;ll have five minutes to talk to each man .
when the bell sounds ...
... you simply move on to the next .
now , why don &apos;t you go ahead and check your invitations
for the proper rotation .
you ever done anything like this before ?
yes .
what do you look for ?
tall , dark , and handsome is fine with me .
you can also tell a lot about a man by his smile ,
how confident or counterfeit he can be .
so what &apos;s your plan ?
i &apos;m gonna bomb every meeting except selena .
you &apos;re afraid you &apos;ll cause a frenzy .
i &apos;m narrowing the odds .
what &apos;s your approach ?
i &apos;m going for the frenzy .
i &apos;m gonna try to charm every one of them .
i want good word of mouth .
sure .
peter .
i &apos;m gonna maintain eye contact
and remember it &apos;s a conversation ,
not an interrogation .
that &apos;s all good ,
but what you want to do , you want to keep it up here
when you talk , right ?
down here , this is all second @-@ date territory .
okay , so be yourself .
just be yourself up here .
and if you &apos;re holding a drink , keep it in your left hand .
that way , when you shake her hand with your right ,
your first touch won &apos;t be cold .
yeah , it is cold .
one final reminder --
some of the men have been known to propose
on the very night of the auction ,
so , please , don &apos;t forget to check their pockets
for engagement rings .
okay , millionaires ,
the moment all these beautiful ladies have been waiting for .
on your marks , get set ...

hi . where were you before new york ?
cleveland .
fascinating .
tell me more about cleveland .
i @-@ it &apos;s in ohio .
i made my first batch of chocolate @-@ chip cookies
when i was 5 years old .
i &apos;ve never looked back .
you seem passionate about pastry .
i &apos;m passionate in everything i do .
nothing compares to it .
hunting deer ?
fawns , actually -- the babies .
are you serious ?
yeah , there &apos;s a certain thrill in the kill .
and -- oh . oh , one second .
what are you doing ?
oh , ho . hey , buddy !

how are you ?
oh , i want to hear more about you .
okay , um , well --
oh , it &apos;s gonna be cold . it &apos;s cold , isn &apos;t it ?
so , i spoke with selena . didn &apos;t get much .
she likes tall , dark , and handsome .
well , how dark are we talking ?
excuse me .
one more minute . one more minute .
i &apos;m looking for that -- the right person .
and what does she look like ?
hi . how are you ?
ah , tsh , tsh , tsh !
just one more minute .
i &apos;m just checking the mavericks score .
they &apos;re losing again .
it &apos;s not good .
she &apos;s looking for someone she can manipulate ,
someone who comes across as sincere
but less than self @-@ assured .
how am i doing ?
you &apos;re great .
yeah .
basically , she wants someone with an honest smile .
a smile .
the &quot; honest &quot; part went right by you , huh ?
pleased to meet you , miss ...
oh , call me selena .
selena .
i &apos;ve got to admit ,
you caught my eye the minute i came down the stairs .
that is a lovely dress .
oh , thank you .
girl has to make an impression , right ?
oh , you do . oh .
tell me a little about yourself .
well , fortunately , i &apos;ve done well --
well enough to devote the majority of my time
to a few nonprofits .
are you ... into nonprofiting ?
well , with the right person , always .
yeah ? that &apos;s nice .
and switch .
well , uh , i hope we get to continue
this conversation another time .
yeah , me too .

it was a little too fast .
it was lovely to meet you .
great to meet you .
hi .
hi .
i &apos;m peter .
hi , peter .
you &apos;re very beautiful .
aw , thank you .
so , why are you here , peter ?
to find someone special .
but most of these women
are only interested in small talk , so ...
well , what are you interested in ?
being caught off guard .
having a conversation that --
that goes beyond the &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
and &quot; where are you from ? &quot;
selena , there are a lot of nice guys here .
i truly hope you find the one you &apos;re waiting for .

second ?
there was a kennedy last year .
was it one of the good @-@ looking ones ?
eh ...
guys , let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s next .
okay . where are you taking her ?
nowhere .
i &apos;m gonna go to her place , drop a bug ,
plant a keylogger ,
and figure out what she has planned .
and how she plans to murder you .
that , and how she &apos;s angling for my money .
is this date gonna be dangerous ?
peter is not dating her .
i &apos;m occupying her .
i &apos;ll have an arrest warrant before dessert .
this is peter .
hey , peter .
it &apos;s selena .
hey ! great to hear from you .
we still on for tonight ?
we have reservations for 8 : 00 p.m.
at the griffin .
it &apos;s downtown .
it &apos;s delicious . it &apos;s ...
i &apos;ll pick you up at 7 : 00 ?
no . i &apos;ll meet you there .
no , no , no . i @-@ i @-@ it &apos;s no trouble .
no . the trouble is you disagreeing with me .
well , what kind of gentleman would i be
if i didn &apos;t pick you up on our first date ?
peter , i &apos;ll see you at 8 : 00 .
see you at 8 : 00 .
no trace .
great !
we don &apos;t know where she is !
if i can &apos;t pick her up ...
you &apos;ll have to drop her off .
you &apos;re gonna have to seal the deal .
no -- no , no ! no deal sealing .
you don &apos;t want her dumping you
and going after another victim .
diana &apos;s right .
you need to impress her enough
that she wants to take you home .
elizabeth got me into this .
yes , she did .
so , technically , it &apos;s okay .
yeah .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna close the deal .
i &apos;m on point .
target &apos;s not here .
relax , commando . it is just a dinner .
i got eyes on selena .
she &apos;ll be inside within a minute .
target sighted .
you look even more handsome tonight ,
if that &apos;s possible .
so do you .
beautiful .
shall we ?
yes .
wonder what &apos;s on the menu .
theirs ?
or ours ?
ours .
it &apos;s a very nice halibut with a mango chutney .
why are you doing this ?
you helped me save face at the auction .
the least i can do is offer you a decent meal .
a candle !
electric .
something to drink ?
please .
may i recommend our merlot ?
a bottle of your vino del diablo .
how adventurous .
i &apos;ll take a risk once in a while .
like the auction .
like you .
oh , so i &apos;m a risk ?
i feel i don &apos;t need to hide anything from you .
maybe that was a little too forward .
no , peter .
there &apos;s nothing more attractive than the truth .
he &apos;s doing good .
well , he &apos;s gonna need to step it up
if he wants an invite back to her place .
you ever cook like this for sara ?
i thought about it .
well , do more than think .
insurance investigator barbie would be thoroughly impressed .
oh , i love this song .
oh , me too .
shall we dance ?
you &apos;ve been adventurous with the merlot .
why stop now ?
is that a tango ?
peter , peter , there are certain things
you cannot recover from .
i can handle this .
i don &apos;t hear any screaming .
let &apos;s go back to my apartment so that --
did you get that ?
the first part loud and clear .
the second ?
never to be repeated .
nice work , agent burke .
peter .
remind me to thank el for the dance lessons .
neal ? neal ?
neal ?
i don &apos;t think he can hear us .
she must have blown the receiver .
why don &apos;t you make us a drink
while i change and put on some music ?
is she actually slipping into something more comfortable ?
i don &apos;t like this woman .
hey , jones . what &apos;s up ?
come on , peter . plant the bug and get out .
if you can hear me , i don &apos;t see a computer ,
so the keylogger isn &apos;t gonna work .
i &apos;m going for the bug plant on the purse .
thanks , jones .
l.a. &apos; s autopsy came in .
selena &apos;s fourth victim dead of a stab wound to the throat .
street mugging .
selena was the only eyewitness ,
and they never caught the assailant .
well , that &apos;s convenient .
the murder happened
while they were out to dinner .
maybe she is a serial killer .
or he caught on to her plan .
what are you doing ?
thought i saw a bug .
i &apos;ll call the exterminator in the morning .
how about those drinks ?
lemon ?
surprise me .
peter ?
yes .
oh , oh , i just spilled it on me .
oh , i &apos;m so clumsy .
he needs help .
all right , i &apos;m gonna call him .
can you generate some sound effects ?
a steel mill , people yelling , something .
the bureau can , and i can patch it through to the call .
you mind if i use your bathroom ?
oh , no , i can help you with that .
oh , no , no . that &apos;s okay . i --
these buttons are difficult . let me --
uh , here , let me get the --
no , no -- i can get it . that &apos;s not a problem .
peter williams &apos; phone .
where &apos;s mr. williams ?
who is this ? you know what ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
we need him here , pronto .
hamilton mill is getting lit up like a christmas tree .
we have an induction furnace that is ready to blow .
sounds important .
this is williams .
hello , mr. williams .
i &apos;m looking for phil -- phil landerer .
right .
you know him ?
okay , on my way .
we &apos;re good .
sorry . i got to handle this .
i know it .
i know . selena , i had a great time .
i &apos;ll make it up to you .
oh , you &apos;ll make it up to me tomorrow night .
gotta go .
yeah .
selena made a call after you left .
i &apos;m pulling up the audio now . hang on .
it &apos;s me .
he left early , but i think i got to him .
did you spook him ?
not at all .
i &apos;ll have williams down on one knee
by the end of the week .
after that , you finish the job , and it &apos;s payday .
she has a partner .
whoever her partner is , they probably run the endgame .
you &apos;re gonna have to keep seeing her .
is there another option ?
anyone ?
i &apos;m sure elizabeth will be completely ... supportive .
we &apos;ll find out when we talk to her .
&quot; we &quot; ?
yes , we .
oh , come on .
why do you have to see her again ?
we &apos;ve run into some ... complications , but --
elizabeth , this -- this woman is a murderer .
another reason i don &apos;t love this !
she needs to be taken out .
down .
down .
she needs to be taken down .
el , i want this over with more than anyone .
is she ... attractive ?
not really .
define &quot; attractive . &quot;
you know , i &apos;m gonna --
i &apos;m gonna take satchmo for a walk ,
get a little air .
bye .
see ya , honey .
that wasn &apos;t a complete train wreck .
but that &apos;s as far as it goes .
you &apos;re seeing selena again tonight .
what &apos;s your plan ?
well , i &apos;m gonna try to get to her cellphone
and find out who she &apos;s talking with .
the sooner this ends , the better .
then propose .
right . what ?
well , you said you want to speed things up , right ?
yeah . - nothing says &quot; enamored &quot; like --
polygamy ?
&quot; marry me . &quot;
no !
no , the cell is a good start .
all right , it &apos;s your operation .
and i &apos;m not changing it .
diana has already prepped the team .
she &apos;s following me in the van .
sounds like you got it covered .
do you mind if i take off ?
where you going ?
sara &apos;s coming to my place .
you &apos;re not the only one with dinner plans .
hey , i got your message . is everything okay ?
i don &apos;t know .
you tell me .
you &apos;re trying to impress me .
well , look , i know you said i didn &apos;t have to , but ...
whatever makes you feel better .
wow . look at you .
no purse ?
no .
i was in the mood for something
a little more private tonight .
let &apos;s go to your place .
my place ?
sure . sounds good .
oh , it will be .
neal , change of plans .
you have 15 minutes to clear out of your apartment ,
or my cover &apos;s blown .
i &apos;m commandeering your date .
it &apos;s very lovely for a first date .
don &apos;t expect this every time .
oh , there &apos;s gonna be a second date ?
guy can hope .
yeah ?
yeah .
i could be talked into it .
neal , go check your phone .
thank you .
who is it ?
we got to get out of here right now .
peter &apos;s undercover . he &apos;s coming up the stairs .
i &apos;ll explain everything later .
no , no ! not that way ! the closet .
uh , new bottle .
through there .
i got it , i got it .
sorry .
ooh , grab me a quiche .
just let me make sure we &apos;re all set .
here we are .
amazing !
oh , peter , you shouldn &apos;t have .
surprise .
what is going on ?
remember that case i was working on ?
the killer bride ?
yeah . peter &apos;s dating her now .
really ?
yep .
so what are we doing ?
this apartment was a backroom speakeasy .
and this was the observation room .
very eclectic , right ?
peter , you didn &apos;t tell me that you were an artist .
i dabble .
i wouldn &apos;t say i &apos;m any good , though .
oh , don &apos;t be modest .
you know , this may sound silly , but ...
... would you draw me ?
oh , i &apos;m sure that we could have ...
you mean right now ?
yeah . why not ?
i @-@ it would take time to do it right .
we have all night .
it wouldn &apos;t do you justice .
oh , but you will . i won &apos;t take no for an answer .
okay .
but , uh ... you should know that i &apos;m experimenting
with some very , very primitive styles .
can peter draw ?
unless she &apos;s expecting a breathtaking stick figure ,
he &apos;s in trouble .
does he know that you &apos;re here ?
unfortunately , yes , he knows about this room .
all right .
let me make sure the light is right .
okay . all right .
hold this .
this is not how i saw the night going , by the way .
i mean , any guy can make a girl dinner .
only you could sketch a black widow
from a hidden back room .
is the pose okay ?
yes . that &apos;s perfect . okay .
but , remember -- no peeking .
peter , i have to ask ,
how did you ...
set this ... all up so fast ?
hey , do yourself a favor .
never try to send a grappling hook through the post office .
i @-@ i mean , that is , if ...
you ever needed to send ... a grappling hook , that is .
perfect timing .
this is my ... man -- haversham .
he made the arrangements .
haversham , everything is perfect .
thank you .
you may enjoy your night off .
so sorry to interrupt ...
such a suspiciously amorous evening .
haversham , do you mind ?
i &apos;ll need my suit for tomorrow .
a suit .
yes .
i &apos;ll be right back .
good .
how handy .
yes , he &apos;s ... one of a kind .
i should have known .
finished .
it looks good .
something &apos;s missing .
neal , are you sure you want to do that ?
well , peter said he wants this case closed fast .
this should help .
okay , but peter is gonna be really mad .
but she won &apos;t .
all right , moz , get this to him without her seeing .
oh , sure .
i &apos;ll hide it under my gargantuan clown sleeve .
oh , come here . try this .
oh , i &apos;m more of a spring .
moz , we don &apos;t have time .
okay . oh . i got it .
okay .
your turncoat for tomorrow , sir .
ah , yes . thank you .
that is exactly what i needed .
good work , moz .
oh , i &apos;m gonna need some ...
cash for the dry @-@ cleaner .
of course .
$ 50 should do it .
don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do without you .
oh , i might need more .
ah . good evening ...
yes .
... madam .
it &apos;s great to meet you ... haversham .
he &apos;s curious .
very high @-@ functioning , considering his condition .
done .
wow ! that looks amazing !
yeah , it is .
peter , what &apos;s this ?
oh , that ?
i wanted tonight to be special .
are you asking me what i think you &apos;re asking me ?
peter ! yes .
yes , yes .
best date ever .
she said yes ? !
you could look at this as another victory for team burke .
eh , el ,
i &apos;m putting my life at risk here .
yes ! you are .
i mean , this was -- this was supposed to be a date ,
not a &quot; save the date . &quot;
the investigation &apos;s almost over .
yeah , i recall hearing that after the first date .
now you &apos;re engaged ?
all i need is to find out who her partner is .
that means contacts , figuring out who she &apos;s close to .
maybe you need a guest list .
guest list ?
for the wedding .
you want to wrap up this case ?
you need an event planner .
look at you two .
peter , you didn &apos;t tell me she was so beautiful .
thank you .
mm , you &apos;re so welcome .
now , i was thinking of setting you guys up by the gazebo .
oh . that sounds great . yeah .
i &apos;ll need a head count to make sure we have enough room .
did you bring your lists ?
selena , friends and family ?
oh , no . i &apos;m new to the city .
i don &apos;t know many people here .
plus , i have all the family i need in this man .
i understand . you want to keep it small .
weddings can be so chaotic .
in the end ,
you &apos;re making a schedule instead of a @-@ a memory .
sounds like you &apos;ve had experience .
you know , my husband and i wanted to keep it small ,
but somehow our wedding ballooned
into this massive event .
you didn &apos;t enjoy it ?
oh , it was lovely . it was really lovely .
but i think if i were to do it again ,
i &apos;d keep it a little more intimate , simple .
just us .
well , hopefully , ours will be more special .
mm ... we ... have to get going .
we have reservations for lunch in a half @-@ hour .
oh , peter , do you mind if i borrow selena for just a moment ?
i would love to go over invitations with her .
sure . i &apos;ll go get the car .
okay . thanks , honey .
um ... now that we &apos;re alone ,
i wanted to ask you something ,
and i didn &apos;t want to do it in front of your fiance ?
um ... have you been married before ?
i have .
how many times ?
what business is that of yours ?
oh , i was just asking to make sure
that you have all the proper legal documents
for the marriage license .
that way , we can avoid a lot of questions .
great .
i &apos;ll have my lawyer send over the papers .
okay . so , we &apos;ll be in touch .
thank you so much .
okay .
ready ?
ready as you are .
peter !
did you , uh -- did you get a look at the license plate ?
uh , no tags .
all right , thank you very much .
i got it from here .
thank you .
wow . that car came out of nowhere .
yeah .
if she hadn &apos;t warned me , i --
oh , i don &apos;t want to think about that .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what i would do if anything happened to you .
and if something did ?
how close was it ?
close .
got my heart pumping .
but then selena and i had one of those
&quot; should anything ever happen &quot; chats .
oh . that &apos;s a pretty good scam .
car nearly runs you down ,
which prompts a discussion about what happens when you &apos;re gone ?
exactly .
she told me if worse comes to worse ,
she wouldn &apos;t want a dime of my money .
really ?
she &apos;d prefer i leave it to charity .
one of her choosing ?
i went through the wills of her victims .
each one left a significant contribution
to a charitable organization .
i &apos;m guessing these don &apos;t exist anymore .
no .
so where &apos;d the money go ?
this may tell us .
we got something from the legal papers
selena gave elizabeth .
the lawyer &apos;s name was a bogus i.d. we tracked to this guy .
look familiar ?
it &apos;s the emcee from the auction .
gerald jameson .
yeah , he hosts dating events worldwide .
never stays in one place for more than a year .
always changes the name and charity of his latest auction .
that &apos;s a great setup .
he puts on these auctions , lines up the suitors ...
she knocks them down .
we need a concrete link
between these two and the charities .
i &apos;ll talk to him .
what are you gonna say ?
that my date didn &apos;t work out .
she was a nice girl who prefers ...
nice girls .
i was gonna say &quot; blondes , &quot; but we can run with that , too .
should give us enough time to case the office .
who is &quot; us &quot; ?
why &apos;d i ask ?
all right , we &apos;re looking for safes ,
vaults , and locked cabinets -- keep an eye out .
hey , hey . great to see you again .
ah , yes , mr. munroe . how can i help you ?
well , i was just wondering about your next event .
i take it ... things didn &apos;t work out .
well , you know , some guys propose on the first date .
some don &apos;t make it to the second .
i see .
and with regards to your little friend over there ,
we have a --
a certain height requirement .
oh , no , no . he &apos;s , uh --
he &apos;s all set with the ladies .
really ?
oh , yeah .
well , i &apos;m sorry to say my next event
won &apos;t be for two months , and that &apos;s in florida .
i love the sunshine state .
am i still tall enough to fill out an application , or ... ?
yes , of course .
i &apos;ll go get it from the back .
8414 .
standard banks @-@ smith security system ,
but it &apos;s gonna be hard to get in here with him hanging around .
then we will have to get to it later .
there you are .
thank you so much .
one more thing .
i love this space .
do -- do you love it ?
yeah . high ceilings !
mm . do you rent it out ?
yes , it is possible .
my friend , mr. williams --
uh , we attended your last auction together --
of course , yes . he &apos;s our big winner .
yes , he had better luck than i did .
and he asked me to help him
with a ... certain celebration .
peter !
welcome to your bachelor party !
can &apos;t believe you did this .
oh , you &apos;re welcome .
not what i meant .
come on .
now we have the entire night to get into jameson &apos;s office .
the harvard crew is all over the place for backup .
this is business .
it is not pleasure .
what is he doing here ?
i love national geographic .
&quot; the mating habits of midlevel government employees
totally captivating . &quot;
well , i &apos;m not on duty . i &apos;m going to get a drink .
this anything like your first one ?
no .
peter .
all right , i &apos;ll distract .
you get in the records room .
got anything ?
no .
i &apos;m gonna get a drink .
nothing .
great .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s gonna kill me first --
my wife or my fiance .
what if i told you there &apos;s a way to spook your lady
into leading us straight to the money ?
how ?
use what we got .
neal , what we &apos;ve got are strobe lights , probies ,
women , and booze .
exactly .
have a probie grab a camera
from the surveillance truck .
we &apos;re taking shots .
mr. jameson !
come on , join us for a drink .
oh , no . no , i really need to keep an eye on the space .
oh , come on . i owe you one .
we owe you one .
yes , none of us would be here if it wasn &apos;t for you .
well , if you put it that way ,
i guess one little drink wouldn &apos;t hurt .
all right .
gentlemen , cheers .
cheers .
cheers .
congratulations .
aah ! that burns !
delicious . thank you . you guys have fun .
no , no , no , no . hold on .
bartender , another round ?
no , no . no , really .

a night to remember .

okay ! oh , god !
yeah , that &apos;s delicious .

one more . no , top shelf .
and cheers again .

four , five , six times ...
you can barely taste it .
you beat us on that one !
much happiness .
cheers .
cheers .
thank you .
what are you doing here ?
miss thomas ?
what can you tell me about this man ?
you &apos;re fbi ?
i was undercover at mr. jameson &apos;s
last fundraiser .
we believe he had illicit financial dealings prior to his death .
his death ?
what happened ?
we &apos;re waiting on the toxicology report .
i &apos;m here because i need to question everyone
affiliated with the society house &apos;s recent auction .
i &apos;m sorry . um ...
this is a shock , but i don &apos;t know anything .
looks like diana got to her .
she &apos;s heading towards the bank .
she &apos;ll be clearing out the money any minute now .
good . give jameson his wake @-@ up call .
peter , you &apos;re on standby .
i got a ping from the bank .
why did you drain our account ?
wait a minute . they told me you were dead .
what ? who told you i was dead ?
we did .
wait a minute . what &apos;s going on ?
you two are under arrest .
wait a minute . you &apos;re fbi , too ?
yeah , let &apos;s just say i &apos;m the adventurous type .
uh , speaking of ,
i think we were all
a little adventurous last night .
further incriminating evidence .
should we give him a little slide show here ?
yeah . yeah .
here &apos;s you on shot number eight ,
having a good time .
here &apos;s you on shot number 12 having a great time .
this is when you told us you had a big payday coming up .
great . good job .
and that &apos;s when you told me
i should enjoy the honeymoon phase while i can .
oh , here &apos;s where you said you were tired
and wanted to go to bed .
something about having to tie up loose ends in the morning .
they say that alcohol &apos;s a truth serum for some people .
you are definitely one of them , my friend .
and , in case you were wondering , we got it all on tape .
peter .
i actually thought we had something .
it wasn &apos;t real .
not even our tango ?
you know , they say that breaking up is tough .
for what it &apos;s worth , it wasn &apos;t me .
it was you .
peter ...
that &apos;s a shame .
would have been a nice wedding .
yeah .
elizabeth ordered most of the arrangements already .
i &apos;m sure she did a great job .
it &apos;s too bad we &apos;ll have to ship them all back .
or ship them somewhere else .
is everything okay ?
peter needs your help right away .
okay .
honey ?
hey , beautiful .
what is this ?
i &apos;m sorry for what you went through on this one .
so , to make it up to you ,
i &apos;m giving you the wedding you always wanted .
small , simple .
just us .
will you marry me again ?
yes .
as many times as you ask .
preacher &apos;s here .
that was fast .
sorry i &apos;m late .
don &apos;t tell me he &apos;s been ordained .
twice .
tax dodge ?
oh , yeah , like i pay taxes .
will you bear witness ?
of course .
dearly beloved , we are gathered here today
