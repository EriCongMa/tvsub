my father was an innocent man ,
destroyed by powerful people .
the graysons are behind this , and they &apos;re gonna pay .
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to avenging his death ...
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
and i won &apos;t stop until they &apos;ve all paid the price .
where am i ?
grayson manor , of course .
you &apos;re takeda &apos;s daughter .
niko .
i &apos;m not supposed to be here .
i should be away with aiden , with his ring on my finger ,
not daniel &apos;s .
you and aiden are engaged ?
and emily obviously doesn &apos;t know about us-- our past .
because of the surgeries required to save your life ,
you &apos;ll never be able to conceive .
emily lied about the pregnancy .
she made it up to scare you away .
are you ending this with me ?
there has been much speculation as to who shot me ,
it was lydia davis .
i know it was you , daniel .
emily cemented lydia &apos;s fate and saved yours .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
when i was a child ,
my father woke me every morning with the same phrase --
&quot; life is a great sunrise . &quot;
the words shaped the way i saw the dawn .
but after my father was taken from me ,
the morning sun burned like fire .
that &apos;s when i learned what hatred was
and that it would greet me each day to come .
you pulled your stitches out in your sleep .
thank you for coming so quickly .
my father would have wanted me to help his favorite disciple .
not punch you in the stomach
and storm out of here like i did last week .
i &apos;m glad you did .
you helped me recommit to takeda &apos;s teachings .
well , let &apos;s get you stitched up .
i &apos;ve decided on a quicker fix .
you called me here to cauterize you ?
that &apos;s insane . i &apos;m not doing it .
do you know what orphans dream of
when they stop wishing for their parents to return ?
we think about filling the emptiness
with families of our own .
thanks to daniel , that hope is gone for me .
this doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re ready for a sparring match .
when you resume physical activity , you have to do it slowly .
then i &apos;ll start with mind games .
first things first , you need something to bite down on .
just do it .
welcome to reckoning day .
no need to furrow that handsome brow .
i &apos;m not here with the police ...
though i should be .
nolan , i can &apos;t begin to tell you how sorry i am .
we are a million miles past sorry .
you assaulted me .
you stole from me ...
all to win favor with your mother ?
there &apos;s something twisted about you . you &apos;re sick .
stop .
why are you here ?
i know that you &apos;re desperate
for answers about how you came to be ,
and ...
i know that victoria hasn &apos;t been forthcoming .
so ... this is a police report
from 1974 .
i dug it up last year when vicky g. enlisted me
to help her find her long @-@ lost son .
you see , according to this , someone else was searching
for little patrick osbourne , as well .
derek .
victoria .
i was told you wouldn &apos;t be here .
oh , this is completely my fault .
dr. robinson only agreed on a house call
because i felt too weak to get to his office .
i thought that you &apos;d be at your morning tennis game , victoria .
my doubles partner mysteriously cancelled .
well , this is awkward .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , ladies .
thank you .
how long have you been seeing my therapist ?
just today .
charlotte mentioned how
helpful he was in bringing you two back together
after she learned that david clarke was her father .
if you &apos;re trying to build a bridge between us , emily ,
here &apos;s a tip -- stay on your side of the river .
dr. robinson warned me you may feel this way ...
and that daniel might be resistant , too .
resistant ?
he hasn &apos;t laid eyes on you in days .
his quarters are so far away ,
he may as well be sleeping in the stables .
well , i guess we &apos;ll just have to give it time , then .
are you sure you don &apos;t mind always sleeping at my place ?
oh , i like your apartment .
it &apos;s cozy .
i grew up in drafty chateaus so big ,
i never knew where my parents or brothers were .
i love opening my eyes in the morning
and seeing you and carl so close .
that &apos;s what makes it a home .
ooh , it &apos;s there !
hey , bobby .
good to see you , man . could you do me a favor ?
would you keep those front @-@ row @-@ center this week ?
it &apos;s the lady &apos;s pride and joy .
sure .
the staff did such a good job .
yeah . wait .
i did not write this .
the by @-@ line says you did .
no , no , i @-@ i mean , yes , i did , but not with those words .
no , i must get to the office .
someone &apos;s head is going to roll .
are you here to escort me out ?
how apt that the woman who left me without an ally
in this family conflict should show me the door .
you &apos;re moving out ?
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know you were leaving .
well , truth be told , i &apos;m elated , like a prisoner paroled .
but rather than shuffling off
with a plastic bag of personal effects ,
i &apos;m taking my first editions .
conrad , i -- i &apos;d like to explain myself .
yeah ? what &apos;s to explain ?
when you held that news conference
and you threw lydia under the bus ,
you destroyed my last chance at happiness .
i had to protect my own chance at happiness .
i won &apos;t lose daniel .
&quot; tamerlane &quot; by edgar allan poe .
this is one of the very few copies left in existence .
in the poem , a warlord reaches the conclusion
that love is more fulfilling than power .
what a fool .
when your paramour betrays you , as daniel will ,
come find me at the southfork .
i &apos;ll be running my wartime operations from there .
that &apos;s for you to keep .
mrs. grayson ,
ms. lemarchal &apos;s calling for daniel .
she said it &apos;s urgent . should i wake him ?
that &apos;s his wife &apos;s job .
daniel ?
margaux called . there &apos;s a crisis at work .
we can &apos;t avoid each other forever .
let &apos;s talk .
all right , come in .
what do you want to chat about ? the weather ?
how i slept last night ?
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t . not much , anyway .
that about does it for me .
what &apos;s new with you ?
第三季 第十三集
i &apos;d love to go to aunt gina &apos;s jewelry party .
just , the thing is , work has me slammed right now .
ma , please don &apos;t say i &apos;m blowing you off .
i ... uh , look , i &apos;ve got to hop .
a customer &apos;s giving me the stink @-@ eye .
yeah .
it &apos;s one thing to deliver a wake @-@ up call
to my husband and his mistress ,
but i have too much self @-@ respect to watch you lounge by our pool .
you have to go now .
well , daniel asked me to stay , and i &apos;m sticking by him .
i won &apos;t let you destroy my marriage .
don &apos;t you think this is sad , emily ?
for you , i mean . he doesn &apos;t love you .
oh , that &apos;s a cheap shot , sara .
i &apos;m trying to handle this with dignity .
after pulling the most pathetic stunt ever ?
faking a pregnancy to lock a guy down .
daniel &apos;s pushing his boundaries with me .
and after the pain i caused , it &apos;s understandable .
right now your earthiness is what &apos;s catching his eye ,
but you don &apos;t fit in here .
i &apos;m actually proud of that .
until people find out about you and start judging him .
because i &apos;m trash ? is that what you &apos;re saying ?
excuse me .
a glass od cristal , please .
right away .
aiden , i am fine with you living here
and i &apos;ve even grown to enjoy
our killer @-@ and @-@ the @-@ tech @-@ wiz &quot; odd couple &quot; dynamic .
but you have a lot of nerve
inviting a perfect stranger to crash here , too .
slow down , felix . i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
then go check with your new roomie , roomie .
i thought you were staying at your father &apos;s loft .
you mean the place where he was murdered ?
i can &apos;t sleep there . it gives me nightmares .
so , when emily called this morning to ask me for help
with her wound care , i decided to pack up my things .
and make yourself at home here .
yeah , it &apos;ll be nice .
so , you -- you attended to emily .
what &apos;s the news ?
physically , she &apos;s gonna be fine .
i think it was finding out she
can &apos;t have children that hit her the hardest .
i can &apos;t imagine she opened up to you .
she ... doesn &apos;t really do that to strangers .
she has to me .
we &apos;ve spoken about all sorts of things .
does she know about us ?
as in how we &apos;re back together , you mean ?
no .
if i told her that , i &apos;d just be bragging .
i thought i could avenge my father &apos;s death by myself ,
but i can &apos;t .
i need you to help me .
what &apos;s the problem ?
he was your mentor .
which is why i &apos;m in .
&quot; aware of the bad blood between thorne and lydia davis ,
conrad grayson took the pre @-@ meditated step
of buying his mistress a handgun
and welcoming her aboard the honeymoon yacht . &quot;
that sentence did not exist when i signed off on the final copy .
the last person to handle the
book was my assistant editor , jessica roche .
she &apos;s responsible .
yeah , well , get her ass in here .
she &apos;s gone -- suddenly picked up and moved to europe .
she sabotaged us , daniel , and believe me , when i find her --
margaux lemarchal ?
oui ?
merci .
oh , great .
conrad is suing voulez for libel .
my father planted the false content .
he paid jessica off . i &apos;m sure of it .
why ?
we had a fight .
the bastard said he was coming after me .
i said , &quot; bring it . &quot;
that was a reckless move .
yeah , well , i didn &apos;t think i had anything else left to lose .
it seems he thought of one thing .
darling , we &apos;re late for our meeting with libby wells .
yeah , i called her studio and canceled that appointment .
jimmy brennan ?
heard of him ?
i hadn &apos;t heard of him , but
if i &apos;m to believe what &apos;s in this police report ,
he may also go by &quot; dear old dad . &quot;
it &apos;s true .
my father showed up at the orphanage that you dumped me at .
instead of being allowed to see his son ,
he was cited for trespassing .
i got shipped off to a family in ohio the very next day .
whoever gave you this information wanted to hurt you .
who was it ?
was it nolan ?
you know what ? i &apos;ll ask the questions here .
when did you meet him ?
when i was 15 .
was he your boyfriend ?
no .
we were together once .
there are 32 jimmy brennans in the tri @-@ state area .
i &apos;m hoping one of them &apos;s mine . take a look .
he was not a father , not the kind you deserved .
yeah , well , you know what ?
that &apos;s my decision to make .
daniel ? why am i learning from bitsy hopkins ,
who heard from her maid , that you have a friend staying over ,
one who sips champagne at my swimming pool ?
i really don &apos;t care what
some old bat from across the road is saying ,
not when my own father is trying to sue me into oblivion .
yes , i &apos;m aware , and i &apos;m here if you need me .
you &apos;re poking a dangerous bear , though .
i can handle dad .
i &apos;m talking about emily .
she &apos;s waging psychological warfare on this family .
you are foolishly taunting her with your infidelity .
well , after the hell that bitch has put me through ,
she deserves to have her nose rubbed in it .
it &apos;s a fine strategy if it &apos;s just the two of you ,
but you brought sara onto this battlefield .
she is a soft target . emily will crush her .
i know because i dismantled conrad &apos;s first wife
in a similar manner .
well , i appreciate the concern ,
but i &apos;ll dismantle mine my way ,
limb by limb .
nothing like a little retail therapy . sorry for the mess .
yeah , you &apos;ll be cleaning it up yourself .
i fired the staff .
what ?
&quot; what ? &quot;
grayson dirty laundry is getting aired through the maid chain .
i questioned the servants , and when no one stepped forward ,
i had to axe the whole team .
that wasn &apos;t fair , daniel .
for 25 years , not a single employee
violated their confidentiality agreements .
now suddenly they &apos;re gossiping because sara spent the night ?
god .
the fact that you still think i &apos;m an idiot makes me laugh .
do you want to know what i really think , daniel ?
i ask myself over and over again , &quot; why did he cheat ? &quot;
and let &apos;s be honest -- we both know you strayed
long before you learned the truth about me
on our wedding night .
what made you lose interest , huh ?
i &apos;m not doing all of this because i &apos;m a bored housewife .
i &apos;m fighting to win you back .
really ?
i &apos;ve been ruminating on your powers of deception ,
and i realized that everything you say
is hidden behind fake concern or a phony smile .
in fact , if anything else suspicious happens around here ,
i &apos;ll know you &apos;re behind it .
and just like today , other people will pay the price
until you finally realize
that there &apos;s no place for you in my life and you leave .
is that him ?
dad !
hey , kiddo ! how you doing ?
okay , kiddo , go ! go ! here ! boom !
why have you never asked me about my adoptive family ?
the only way i could survive
letting you go was to imagine you happy .
well ... here &apos;s the reality .
ed and barbara osbourne were my parents .
i @-@ i don &apos;t really , uh , remember much about her .
she died when i was 4 .
and after that , dad married anne .
anne didn &apos;t give a damn about me , so ...
neither did he .
to feel that kind of rejection from your --
your father makes you feel like , um ...
it made me feel like there was something wrong with me ...
no ...
something , uh ...
something bad , unlovable .
i still do .
oh , no ! he &apos;s coming in ! he &apos;s coming in !
which way -- ohh ! i got him ! he &apos;s gonna slam him ! boom !
it could have been different .
hi . it &apos;s so good to see you .
mm . you too .
yeah , i would have stopped by sooner ,
but i had to make sure that patty cakes
and his moms were off @-@ site .
damn , girl . what is with all the zeroes ?
daniel tried to put me in my place
by firing the house staff today .
the least i can do is cover their salaries ... and then some .
your husband &apos;s ... kind of a hole .
he even has sara sleeping over .
he &apos;s trying to chase me away .
you know , with the leverage the guy &apos;s gunplay gave you ,
it &apos;s not like he can just ask for a divorce .
it &apos;s a risk that he just might take .
he loves sara , so sara &apos;s got to go .
mm , another day , another breakup .
you &apos;re not even gonna ask about aiden ?
how is he ?
he &apos;s one of the reasons i wanted to stop by .
i meant what i said . we can &apos;t be together .
no , no , no .
i &apos;m not here on his behalf .
i want to cut him loose , too .
i only let him stay with me because you asked me to .
but now with niko in the picture
making big ben chime every hour on the hour , ugh ,
they need to find their own love shack .
they &apos;re together ?
you didn &apos;t know ? i didn &apos;t realize ...
where are you going ?
i just -- i can &apos;t sit still any longer .
emily ?
emily ?
what are you doing here ?
emily ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i @-@ i was looking for nolan .
are you okay ?
you ... you seem unsteady .
oh , just , uh , since my head injury ...
i &apos;m getting a little dizzy sometimes . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s nothing .
i need to get home . i @-@ i had no intention of seeing you .
no . you wait . i &apos;ve got things to say to you .
i can &apos;t have this conversation right now .
look , i understand you got hurt ,
but you don &apos;t just get to abandon me
without hearing my side of things .
look , i can &apos;t forget about the future we planned together .
okay ? and neither can you .
w @-@ why else would you be coming here , giving me mixed signals ?
you &apos;re conflicted .
no , i &apos;m not .
if you walk out of here , this is over .
you &apos;re gonna have to live with your choice .
like your choice to screw niko ?
we know it was you who planted the misinformation .
first libel , now slander ?
i would watch my words if i wre you , ms. lemarchal .
cut the crap , dad .
only you would malign yourself just to screw me over .
okay . how do we fix this ?
i &apos;m willing to drop my suit just as soon as you fire my son .
what are you trying to pull ?
just something the french call a coup d &apos;etat .
my sources inform me that there &apos;s a clause in daniel &apos;s contract
that allows you to buy back his shares in voulez .
i would , in turn , purchase them from you
at twice the market value .
if you think we &apos;re gonna cave to your threats , you have --
i &apos;ll do it .
margaux .
this is not about negotiating .
he &apos;s out to destroy you , and i won &apos;t allow my success
or my family &apos;s reputation to be killed in the crossfire .
you want to get in bed with the devil ?
clearly , i can &apos;t stop you .
i assume satan will want the corner office .
i have no desire to punch a clock --
just my boy .
what is this ?
where &apos;s aiden ?
i don &apos;t know .
we were supposed to have dinner , but he &apos;s gone .
no call , no text , just gone .
doesn &apos;t it bother you when people are inconsiderate ?
yeah ... niko , it does .
and , uh ...
look , while i was hoping to chew this fat with your boo present ,
uh , i think it &apos;s time i just ripped off the band @-@ aid .
o ... m @-@ g.
i &apos;m studying my father &apos;s autopsy for the first time .
the authorities were unclear as to the murder weapon ,
but those stab wounds tell a tale .
they were made by a katana . his katana .
how can you be so sure ?
because it traveled everywhere with him
and now it &apos;s not in his loft .
i think the killer stole it .
and i will hunt him to the ends of the earth .
in the meantime , i &apos;m practicing separating skin from flesh .
was there something you wanted to say to me ?
it can wait .
okay .
you &apos;re home !
i have a surprise .
i stopped by your full gourmet kitchen for a snack earlier .
nobody was there , so i started puttering around ,
and next thing you know ...
everything &apos;s from scratch .
caprese salad , pasta primavera ,
and pistachio gelato for dessert .
and after dinner , our italian theme continues
with &quot; roman holiday &quot; in the screening room .
why , you &apos;re very sweet .
what &apos;s wrong ?
my father had me ousted from &quot; voulez . &quot;
danny ...
what &apos;s going on lately , huh ?
just seems like you can &apos;t catch a break .
are you kidding me ?
i just caught the biggest break of my life ...
you .
i don &apos;t know . i @-@ i @-@ i just can &apos;t be in this house right now .
everything reminds me of him .
okay , well , let &apos;s go out . anywhere you want .
okay ...
italy .
seriously ?
uh , what about keeping up appearances for your marriage ?
what about emily ?
i don &apos;t care about either of those things .
tomorrow , you and i are gonna hop on the jet
and take a roman holiday of our own .
come on .
you shouldn &apos;t have followed me here .
well , after i saw you steal
away from the house , you left me no choice .
those guys over there work for jimmy .
i , uh , called his construction company ,
pretending to be a roofer looking for a job .
it wasn &apos;t hard to find his favorite watering hole .
all right , before you make contact with that man ,
there are things i have to tell you about him .
i don &apos;t really want to hear it .
there have been too many times since we &apos;ve reconnected
that you &apos;ve punted this conversation .
i want to meet my father on my terms .
not through your impressions of him .
so , please ...
just go .
you ...
relax , honey .
it &apos;s okay . shh , shh ! it &apos;s okay .
take me out of here , please .
come on . let &apos;s go , come on .
thank you .
did you know , deep down , i hate tea ?
my mother was a fan of instant coffee .
she was a vulgar woman who murdered her lover
when i was 15 and forced me to take the blame .
when i released back to her custody ...
she stood by as another one of her boyfriends ...
molested me .
after she threw me out ,
i made myself drink fortnum &apos;s earl grey
as a way to forget about my past and seem more upper @-@ crust .
what did jimmy brennan do to you ?
well , as i told you , he lived down the hall .
i was a child pretending to be an adult ,
desperate to re @-@ create myself .
jimmy was like a big brother , a few years older than i ,
and he always watched over me .
so , when a fuse blew one day in my apartment ,
i didn &apos;t think twice about following him down to the basement .
to help him fix it .
he kisses me ...
and i say , &quot; no , we &apos;re just friends , &quot;
and i try to pull away .
and he has this look on his face like a monster .
he punches me ,
and i raise my arms to cover my face
to mask my shame and my confusion .
because i had worked so hard .
i did everything to change myself , and i ...
i knew he could still see the victim .
and he pushes my face into the cold concrete ,
and he whispers , &quot; relax , honey . &quot;
over and over and over .
a @-@ all i could do ...
was focus on the pilot light underneath the water heater ...
and wait for him to be done .
the day you were delivered , they put you in my arms
and you heard my voice and you looked straight in my eyes .
and i felt this calm .
there was nothing of jimmy in you .
you were from me and no one else .
and we were happy .
then why did you , um ...
he started stalking me , so we , uh ...
we ran from apartment to apartment
until there was nowhere else to go .
and then this miracle happened --
a scholarship to paris .
painful as it was ,
i knew it was the only way i could protect us both .
when i took you to sister rebecca ,
i told her that jimmy might come for you ,
and she vowed to keep you away from him at any cost .
the truth ...
i didn &apos;t know what to do with it .
withholding it from you caused such anguish .
but how could revealing it not cause you more ?
patrick .
do not let these circumstances
define you the way i let them define me .
how &apos;s the magazine ?
you sort out how those lies got in there ?
still sorting .
yeah ?
i would rather not bore you with the details .
i &apos;m just glad to be home .
well , i &apos;m glad that you feel this is home .
what is all this ?
i &apos;ve been house hunting .
where will you move to ?
ideally , um , someplace close ...
with a yard , um ...
with you .
you &apos;ve said that you love waking up where we are .
well ...
i love you .
and i know it seems sudden , but if i &apos;ve learned anything ,
it &apos;s that life is too short and happiness is fleeting .
i think that we make a great team ,
and a home -- a real home --
should be someplace that we start together .
say something . i &apos;m swinging for the fences here .
i love you , too .
i love you , too .
this was taken by a bank security camera
across from your father &apos;s loft the night of his murder .
who is he ?
gregor hoffman ,
the one who planted the bomb at grayson global last year .
your father was onto him . i think hoffman realized it .
i reached out to my contacts ,
and one came back with a cellphone ping ,
proving that hoffman is alive and well
and living in moscow .
so , i got you a flight .
it leaves tonight .
you &apos;re not coming with me .
my father trained you to be what you are today .
you loved him . you --
but you love emily more .
come on .
i &apos;ll take you to nolan &apos;s . you can pack .
whatever we need , we &apos;ll buy when we get there ,
including the luggage to bring it all home .
hey , how about one of those louis vuitton trunks ?
oh , it &apos;s italy . i &apos;m going gucci , baby .
sara marie .
ma . we , um ...
h @-@ how are you here ?
well , when you refused to engage with me , sara ,
i didn &apos;t know what else to do .
so , this is where you &apos;ve been
when you tell me you &apos;re at work ?
you &apos;re lying to your family ,
sneaking around with this ... prince ?
if i could just explain ...
you don &apos;t talk to me .
now , i don &apos;t know how you manipulated
my smart , self @-@ sufficient girl ,
but i won &apos;t forget the hell you put her through ,
and i did not nurse you back to health
to see you become this person ,
this home @-@ wrecker .
no , it &apos;s not like that .
danny and i love each other .
so you can do whatever you want ?
she almost died , and here you are , moving in on her man .
that girl is snowing you . she &apos;s a menace .
she ruined danny &apos;s life .
no , our problems didn &apos;t start
until you came back into his world .
come on , sara , we &apos;re leaving .
ma .
look , i love you , but ...
you got to mind your own business .
you are no longer a daughter of mine .
good luck , sweetheart .
i &apos;m sorry for your pain .
come here . come here .
i &apos;m sorry i made us miss our flight .
oh , that &apos;s the beauty of flying private .
our departure time is whenever we want .
i , uh -- i was thinking ,
i wanted to reach out to your mom .
i want to explain our side of things .
yeah , it won &apos;t work .
i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll get a divorce . i @-@ i &apos;ll phone my attorney tomorrow --
no , emily is never letting you go , danny .
she destroyed my relationship with my mother ,
and that was just her first swing at me .
then we &apos;ll swing back .
my mom was right .
this isn &apos;t me .
i got swept up in something , and -- and -- and i want out .
goodbye , daniel .
mission accomplished ?
niko bought it . she &apos;s in there gathering her things .
i have to admit , i &apos;m surprised you were willing
to doctor that information for me .
you mean ...
surprised that i would help cover your guilt ?
aiden , life &apos;s complicated ,
as are things between you and emily .
i am worried about her , ross .
the emily that left me is not the one that i know .
something is off .
really ?
because when i saw her , she seemed back to normal .
what do you think is wrong ?
i &apos;m not certain .
maybe you can get to the bottom of it when i &apos;m out of your hair
and niko is chasing hoffman &apos;s dead @-@ end trail .
it &apos;s not a dead end . she &apos;ll find hoffman .
that wasn &apos;t the plan .
the man killed declan porter .
you said you wanted your femme nikota to taste vengeance .
well , this way she will ...
and justice will be served .
straight up .
many believe there is no such thing as too much love .
that its warmth is a comfort from which we never tire .
but when love turns to obsession , it consumes itself .
the flame that nourished
becomes angry , merciless ,
an all @-@ consuming blaze ...
leaving us confused by the chill in the air
and the hate left behind .
sara left me .
to break me ?
is this what you wanted ?
i told you i was gonna fight for us .
are you insane ? there will never be an us !
thanks to you , i &apos;m dead inside .
so am i ! we did this to each other , daniel .
you took from me , so i took from you .
don &apos;t you see ?
we belong together .
sterilizing you was my gift to the universe .
oh , good . you &apos;re awake .
you were marvelous last night , mrs. grayson .
until our next rendezvous .
how was the flight from california ?
smooth .
it &apos;s funny .
when they told me who i was meeting ,
i was expecting to see the former governor &apos;s wife .
hardly . i &apos;m the first mrs. grayson .
well , you know what they say -- nothing beats the original .
i think so , too .
