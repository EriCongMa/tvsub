第一季 第二集
and everyone is talking .
blair , it &apos;s serena .
serena ?
and b . &apos; s boyfriend nate
rumor has it
he &apos;s always had a thing for serena .
but you &apos;re back now . i didn &apos;t come back for you .
look , blair &apos;s my best friend ,
and you &apos;re her boyfriend ,
and she loves you .
why did she leave ? why did she return ?
must be a lot of rumors why you &apos;re back .
yeah , but none of them mention you .
he tries to take his own life ,
and you &apos;re worried it &apos;s gonna cost you &quot; mom the year &quot; ?
you have no idea what it &apos;s been like .
the best friend and the boyfriend
that &apos;s pretty classy , s .
and nate &apos;s friend chuck
won &apos;t let serena forget about her past .
i &apos;m trying to change . i liked you better before .
and then there &apos;s dan , the outsider .
looks like his childhood crush has returned .
she doesn &apos;t know me. nobody knows me. it &apos;s cool .
no. no , no , no , no , no. uh , serena , um , do you know this young man ?
oh , from last night. you remember me ?
you &apos;d really go out with some guy you don &apos;t know ?
well , he can &apos;t be worse than the guys i do know .
guess whose dad is cool .
it &apos;s a trick question .
yeah , cause it can &apos;t be ours .
&quot; top ten forgotten bands of the &apos; 90s . &quot;
yeah , check out who is number nine
he &apos;s very proud. hey !
hey , way to be forgotten .
why is my daughter going to one of your concerts ?
well , our kids were bound to meet. it &apos;s a small island .
are you sure it &apos;s not some ploy ,
your using my daughter to get to me now that your wife left you ?
serena and her mystery man made a surprise appearance
at blair &apos;s kiss on the lips party .
serena &apos;s here ?
what is she doing here ? she wasn &apos;t invited .
but serena wasn &apos;t the only one who made an impression ...
who &apos;s the newbie ?
jenny made an impression on chuck .
let &apos;s go and talk somewhere quieter .
get off ! stop !
hey ! that is my little sister !
don &apos;t you ever touch her again !
hey , your life is over , slut !
she better not show her face again .
i &apos;m actually hoping she will .
you think i got a shot at a second date ?
we &apos;ll talk about it in the cab
and now that s. is back ,
will the upper east side ever be the same ?
we &apos;re all just dying to see what happens next .
i bet you &apos;re wondering
what gossip girl is doing up so early .
truth is , i never went to bed .
why waste precious time dreaming
when waking life is so much better ?
is there really anything better than a lazy sunday ?
reading the paper in bed , sipping coffee ,
scrambling an egg or two .
yeah , right .
we upper east siders don &apos;t do lazy .
breakfast is brunch ,
and it comes with champagne , a dress code
and a hundred of our closest friends ...
and enemies .
chuck &apos;s dad , bart bass ,
is hosting the annual brunch for his foundation .
everyone is invited .
well , not everyone .
oh. hey , you &apos;re up .
and you &apos;re checking up on me .
i &apos;m okay. really , i &apos;m okay .
you know , i was okay when you asked me at the party
and in the cab , when we got home ,
before and after i brushed my teeth .
look , i just feel really stupid .
i mean , how could i have actually thought
that chuck bass just wanted to talk to me ?
because you trust people ,
which is normally a good thing .
yeah , except when it involves chuck .
yeah , pretty much .
so the real question is , uh , how are you ?
me ?
why wouldn &apos;t i be okay ?
you know , at the end of the night , with serena
and the--the--the ...
was it really that bad ?
this is me .
so ... good night .
yeah .
yeah. um , yeah , good night .
go ! walk her to the door. something. go ! okay .
oh ! oh , god. that hurt a lot. whoa , whoa , stop , stop .
oh , i think i have brain damage .
you know what , dan ?
you wouldn &apos;t even know if you had brain damage .
no , let &apos;s go , please .
no !
h @-@ hi .
so he waved ?
i wouldn &apos;t take it as a waver
no , he was just trying to be funny .
maybe he &apos;s shy .
or he hates me .
no guy in the history of the world has ever hated you .
she probably thinks i hate her now .
i &apos;ve waited my entire adolescent life for a date with this girl ,
you know , serena van ddsen ...
and i decide to close the evening with a wave .
it was a nice wave.at the end of a date ?
come on , here &apos;s no such thing .
and you only get one shot with a girl like serena .
i got mine , and i blew it .
which means you have nothing to lose .
no , nothing except my last shred of dignity .
oh , no . i think that &apos;s gone .
you &apos;re right .
you know what ? i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m gonna go talk to her .
i &apos;m gonna apologize for the wave .
i &apos;m gonna tell her how much i like her ,
and i &apos;m gonna ask for a second shot .
no , i &apos;m gonna get a second shot .
yeah , you are .
yeah. wait , wait , wait .
i love the plan ,
but , uh , you need a better outfit .
and maybe a shower .
whatever. it &apos;s probably for the best .
the last thing i need in my life is a new guy .
he was just so smart , th
and--and funny ...
it sounds like you like him .
and really nice .
god , blair was so mean to me last night .
i don &apos;t even know why. whatever .
i &apos;m sure if we talk about it , we can work it out .
hey , maybe i should go over there .
serena had better just stay away .
thank you , dorota. yeah , thanks .
we love sleeping at blair &apos;s .
i don &apos;t want to see serena at school ,
and she better not show at brunch today .
you &apos;re really mad at serena .
yeah , i hope you never get that mad at us .
well , you would never do what serena did
no , never. of course not .
i wonder if nate remembered brunch .
it would be so wrong for me to show up
without my boyfriend whom i love , and who loves me .
hello ?
hi , sweetie. did i wake you ?
no , i &apos;m up .
well , get some strong coffee
and jump in the shower , sleepyhead .
chuck &apos;s dad &apos;s brunch for his foundation
is today at the palace .
oh , right. of course .
nathaniel , keep it down .
some of us are trying to regain our strength .
your dad &apos;s brunch is today .
alarm &apos;s set for 9 : 00 .
it &apos;s ten
ladies , double @-@ time .
oh , unless ... nathaniel ...
i &apos;m good .
actually , could you two bring some coffee
when you get a chance ? and some water ... lots of water .
you want ice with that ?
looks like you could use some .
that &apos;s enough , ladies .
and i &apos;ll be sure to tell my father
just how committed you are to the hospitality industry .
that kid popped you pretty good , huh ?
never mess with a guy &apos;s sister .
and if i knew his name ,
i &apos;d hunt him down and kill him .
why , &apos; cause you kill people now ?
you gonna strangle him with your scarf ?
don &apos;t mock the scarf , nathaniel. it &apos;s my signature .
i &apos;m just saying ,
death by scarf-- not that intimidating .
he sucker punched me . i told you .
besides , better a broken nose
than a broken heart .
what ? i didn &apos;t even talk to serena last night .
who said anything about serena ?
do i look okay ?
definitely second @-@ shot material .
all right , then i &apos;m gonna go .
and about what happened , you know , with , uh , chuck ?
if you wanna , like , talk to someone ...
n @-@ not your brother-- just let me know .
okay .
yeah , i &apos;ll ...
all right .
hey , uh , wait .
actually , there is someone i wanna talk to .
hey , hey , where you guys going ?
i was gonna make waffles .
ooh. sorry , dad .
yeah , can &apos;t .
but i wanna hear about your date .
later .
and your party .
when we get back .
you guys missed a really great show ,
and i make really good waffles .
palace hotel lobby .
hi. this is , uh , nate archibald
calling from the bass suite .
i know you don &apos;t normally give out this information ,
but can you tell me what room the van der woodsens are in , please ?
hey , blair. it &apos;s me .
uh , i guess you &apos;re still sleeping ,
but i &apos;m gonna come over .
i think we need to talk .
okay. uh , see you soon. bye .
it looks like the table &apos;s all set .
as soon as the guests arrive , we can start dishing .
here &apos;s what &apos;s on the menu ...
mom , did you borrow my michel perrys ?
i can &apos;t find anything in here !
well , it might help if you unpacked .
look , you &apos;re home now .
it &apos;s your life. you should start living it .
this is not life , this is a hotel--
which we &apos;re living in
because you decided you didn &apos;t like the color of the walls in our real home .
mom , i said i &apos;d go to this brunch .
what more do you want from me ?
sweetie , why are you being like this ?
you love parties. this is just not like you .
maybe it is like me. maybe you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m really like .
oh , okay , tell me .
so did you and dan have fun at the concert last night ?
we , um , never made it .
we actually ended up at the kiss on the lips party .
ah. well , that must have pleased blair .
blair ? actually , no , not that pleased ,
which is why i &apos;m going to talk to her .
well just be back in time for brunch , okay ?
mom .
honey , i know how hard it is for you to be back ,
but the more you hide yourself away ,
the more people are gonna think you have something to hide .
coming from someone , who &apos;s keeping my brother in an institution .
that &apos;s different . i mean it. don &apos;t be late .
hey. how you doing ?
uh , i @-@ i was in yesterday with serena .
how could i forget ?
yeah , well , um , is she in ?
just missed her , actually , but you &apos;re welcome to wait .
okay , maybe i will .
she--she probably won &apos;t be that long , right ?
once she went out and didn &apos;t come back for six months ,
but feel free to sit .
over there .
over there is where i &apos;ll be .
hi , nate. it &apos;s great to see you .
hi , mrs. van der woodsen. good to see you .
oh , i &apos;m just heading out .
oh , is serena in ?
oh , you just missed her , but i &apos;ll tell her you came by .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be happy to hear it .
uh , i don &apos;t know about that .
oh , what ? come on , serena loves you .
i mean , i think she &apos;s always had a little crush on you .
of course , you and blair are the perfect couple .
mm. is serena gonna be long ? i could just wait .
oh , well , dexter here can take care of you .
i &apos;m just gonna step out for a while .
nate &apos;s gonna wait for serena .
great. he can get in line behind that guy .
i had a feeling you &apos;d be back .
dan , is it ?
humphrey. yes .
it &apos;s nice to see you again , mrs. van der woodsen .
i hope you &apos;ve had a pleasant , uh ...
uh , 21 hours since i last saw you .
yes , it has been very pleasant ...
until now .
gentlemen .
blair ?
serena .
hey , i got two bone @-@ dry caps and audrey .
i must have totally blanked
on the part where i invited you over .
i @-@ i called you .
blair , it &apos;s sunday morning .
coffee , croissants , &quot; breakfast at tiffany &apos;s . &quot;
it &apos;s our tradition .
i have new traditions now .
well , they &apos;re not traditions if they &apos;re new .
look , blair ,
i &apos;m really trying to make an effort here .
i thought everything was good between us .
it was ...
before i found out you had sex with my boyfriend .
how &apos;d you find out ?
nate told me .
at least he felt he owed it to me to tell the truth .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
don &apos;t bother saying anything .
i wouldn &apos;t believe you anyway .
blair , it was ...
you know ...
i always knew you were a whore .
i never took you for a liar , too .
blair , how can i fix this ?
you don &apos;t , serena .
you just stay away from me ,
my boyfriend and my friends .
you &apos;re done here .
serena &apos;s visit was short and apparently not very sweet .
but you know what is ?
revenge.we hear it &apos;s best served cold .
who &apos;s hungry ?
dorota , i told you i didn &apos;t want to see anyone .
hi , jenny .
hi .
what do you want ?
i realized that i still have your calligraphy pens from the party invitations ,
and thought you might need them for something .
that is the lamest excuse i &apos;ve ever heard .
you wanna know what chuck bass is saying about you .
no .
is he ... saying things ?
is anyone ?
mm ... no .
not yet , anyway .
chuck likes to brag about his conquests , not his victims .
come on. you can help me get ready for brunch .
okay. sure .
nice flowers .
they &apos;re hydrangeas .
just coffee . i &apos;m not staying long .
i &apos;d like to get out of here before someone throws me down and tattoos me .
this is brooklyn , lil , not the warped tour .
and don &apos;t tell me you had all your tattoos removed .
i mean , even that one ,
that little heart @-@ shaped one between your , uh ... uh ,
don &apos;t try to be cute , okay ?
those days are well behind you .
and here i thought i was getting better @-@ looking every day .
so what &apos;s the big emergency ?
dan went out with serena last night .
and us humphreys sure are proud of him .
well , currently , he &apos;s sitting in the lobby of the hotel where we &apos;re living .
hi. can i help you ?
two americanos ... one with an extra shot ? mm @-@ hmm .
you don &apos;t actually think
i &apos;m gonna tell my kid who he can and can &apos;t date .
i mean , is that really the reason you came down here ?
oh , well , i know what you &apos;re implying .
admit it.you &apos;re falling for me again .
you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right. it &apos;s the low @-@ income tax bracket ,
the bad v @-@ neck t @-@ shirts , the awful jokes .
i don &apos;t know why your wife left you .
well , she &apos;s got better taste than you .
here you are .
i mean , come on. why else have i seen you
more in the last 2 days than in the last 15 years ?
an unfortunate twist of fate .
but fate nonetheless. unless you , uh ...
are you seeing someone ?
no , not really .
uh @-@ huh , not serious ...
or he &apos;s married. that is your type .
that &apos;s enough , rufus .
what &apos;s his name ?
i &apos;ve read about him in &quot; forbes &quot; or &quot; rolling stone &quot; ?
well , whoever he is , i &apos;m sure he can &apos;t keep up with you .
well , i &apos;m gonna take that as a compliment ,
but i &apos;m serious . i &apos;m worried about serena .
i don &apos;t need some new boy influencing her ,
distracting her from her needs .
well , no offense , lil ,
but i &apos;m guessing a kid like dan is exactly what serena needs .
so , uh ...
what do you need to talk to serena about ?
nothing , just in the neighborhood .
you ?
i ...
am nowhere near the neighborhood ,
but i &apos;m working on a better excuse .
you guys , like ...
i ... i don &apos;t know .
yeah , well , that &apos;s serena .
with her , you &apos;ll never know .
nathaniel .
there you are. what are you doing ?
nothing , waiting for you .
him ?
hey , what are you doing here ?
why , what is this-- uh , your hotel ?
actually , it is. yeah ,
so unless you have a reason to be here ,
i &apos;ll have to ask you to wait on the curb
with the rest of the trash .
trash ? look , man , i live in brooklyn , all right ?
not the ozarks ...
no offense to the ozarks .
but don &apos;t you think we &apos;re taking this class warfare thing a little too far ?
i haven &apos;t even started , man .
okay , man , let &apos;s just go .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re sticking up for serena &apos;s new bitch .
if anyone &apos;s got a reason to kick his ass , it &apos;s you .
he &apos;s not worth it. not here .
this isn &apos;t over .
hey , anytime , man .
that one black eye looks a little lonely .
come on , chill out .
wow. blair , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s beautiful .
i mean , you look ... beautiful .
it &apos;s average .
the color is last season ,
and besides , stella mccartney has
a much better version at bergdorf &apos;s .
right. i ... i &apos;ve been meaning to go by bergdorf &apos;s .
wow , these dolls are great .
oh , my god. you have a cabbage patch .
my brother used to have one of these. his name was cedric .
your brother &apos;s name is cedric ?
uh , no that was his cabbage patch kid .
my brother &apos;s name is dan .
actually , you might know him .
he , um , he went out with serena last night .
that &apos;s your brother ?
so does that mean you &apos;re friends with serena now ?
i mean , i don &apos;t have a problem with her ,
but if someone did have a problem with her ,
i wouldn &apos;t have a problem with that either .
you know ...
if you like that dress , you can have it .
what ? no , no .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll find some way to repay me .
oh , blair , thank you .
i mean , for the dress and ...
for the other thing about , uh , about chuck .
if you want to be part of this world , jenny ,
people will talk ...
eventually ,
and you need to decide if all this is worth it .
dan. hey .
i @-@ i @-@ i was in the neighborhood ...
uh , give or take 70 blocks .
um , i just wanted to tell you in person
that , uh , the end of last night
may have not been my finest hour .
there was a , uh , a wave .
i @-@ i @-@ i saw that , yeah .
yeah , yeah , and since then ,
i &apos;ve just been wondering , uh ...
are you hungry ?
yes .
actually , i &apos;ve had the worst morning
well , you--you wanna-- you wanna talk ?
and eat ? not necessarily in that order .
yes , i would love to do both ,
but food first , because i &apos;m starving .
great.just in time for brunch .
mom .
ms. van der woodsen .
dan ... still here .
look , mom , i really don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea for me to go to that brunch .
you promised .
yeah , but that was bef--
before i knew dan was hungry , too .
i can &apos;t let the boy starve .
it would be inhumane .
he &apos;s not invited .
yeah , that &apos;s why i &apos;m going with him .
because i can &apos;t go with her .
and we have plans to go to brunch together today
we had those plans .
serena , you &apos;re home ,
living under my roof , my rules .
what is it gonna take to get you dressed
and through that door ?
uh , you know what ? may-- maybe this was a @-@ a bad idea .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding .
yeah , this was--this was definitely a bad idea .
this should be fun .
looks like chuck and blair showed up with quite an appetite ...
for destruction , that is .
hey , dad , how &apos;s the new song going ?
oh , i think i need more coffee .
whatever works .
where &apos;d you get the dress ?
oh , it was a thank you @-@ gift from blair
for doing the party invitations. oh ,
and it looks like a very expensive thank you gift
dad , she has a closet the size of this apartment
just full of them. see , her mom designed it .
and her mom is a very talent
but the dress you made for yourself is much nicer .
which is why you don &apos;t wear dressiness
uh , one of a couple of reasons .
hey , you think the farmers market &apos;s still open ?
yeah. why , you wanna go ? yeah .
i thought you were getting too old to go places with your dad .
well , you used to be cool ,
and the &apos; 90s are having a comeback .
you have no idea how much that hurts .
well , i can &apos;t say much for his child @-@ rearing skills ,
but bart bass knows brunch .
um , i , uh , i @-@ i need to use the ladies room .
uh , you think you &apos;ll be okay by yourself for a while ?
yeah. come on. me and , uh , some beluga caviar ?
can &apos;t get enough of the stuff .
okay .
great .
hey , how &apos;s it going ?
no , you &apos;re--you &apos;re okay .
yeah , just , uh , go ahead and do your thing .
charles .
would you excuse me ?
father .
the , uh , the invitation said &quot; black tie , &quot;
not &quot; black eye . &quot;
are you okay ?
i mean , if you &apos;re in some kind of trouble ...
only of my own making .
why do you think i do all this , huh ?
this party is for you , okay ?
so you can meet people ,
you know , become a part of something ,
make some kind of change .
really ?
i thought it was another excuse for an open bar
and , uh , rehiring of the nearly nude statues .
do me a favor , will you ?
lose the scotch. it &apos;s barely noon .
serena , i really need to talk to you .
actually , i need to talk to you , which means you can listen .
nate , you told blair. what were you thinking ?
look , i want to explain .
sorry .
we can &apos;t talk here .
what , where blair might see us ?
meet me in chuck &apos;s suite .
i &apos;m not sneaking around with you .
please. just to talk .
ten minutes .
i &apos;ll meet you up there .
you look beautiful , as always .
where &apos;s your lovely mother today ?
paris. must be some drama at the atelier .
oh , nothing too dramatic , i hope .
her line is doing very well .
i was just telling my firm what a great investment she &apos;d make .
she &apos;s really going places .
hopefully places far , far away .
just kidding .
hey. let me get you a refill . i &apos;ll be right back .
i &apos;ll go with you. excuse us .
blair seems happy. it looks like , uh ,
you &apos;re taking care of business , as discussed .
dad , not everything in life &apos;s a business deal .
come talk to me in thirty years .
i want to introduce you to timothy good. hi .
his firm has got some really interesting summer internships .
i can &apos;t believe serena came to this brunch .
i told her to stay away .
you worried about nate ?
just a shot in the dark .
i think you know what you need to do to get his attention .
and what &apos;s that ?
the key to my suite ,
nate &apos;s heart and your future happiness .
i &apos;m honored to be playing even a small role in your deflowering .
you &apos;re disgusting .
yes , i am , so why be shy ?
just grab nate and finish this .
report back with details .
nice to meet you .
what are you doing right now ? uh , well , i was just gonna--
how about me ? um ...
what , you have a better offer or ...
no , of course not. yeah ?
uh , now ?
now. now .
mmm. where are we going ?
i got us the best room in the whole place .
wait , this is chuck &apos;s suite. nate .
serena ?
blair .
spotted--n. and b .
hot and heavy in the halls of the palace hotel ,
only to find s. already waiting .
sparks were flying for sure ,
but will it be a 3 @-@ way
or d @-@ day ?
what is she doing here ?
i was meeting nate .
just to talk , i swear .
you said you &apos;d never speak to her again .
you said that ? why would you say that ?
because you can &apos;t be trusted .
it &apos;s not serena &apos;s fault .
do not defend her .
i asked her to come. oh. oh ,
so you do want to talk to her .
yes , to explain why i &apos;m not talking to her .
maybe i &apos;ll leave you two
to finish that fascinating conversation .
oh , no , no . i &apos;ll go. let you guys get back to your quickie .
it wasn &apos;t a quickie .
sex is actually kind of a big deal to some of us .
oh , yeah , i can see that. chuck &apos;s bed ? very romantic .
classy , too .
oh , like you ?
i &apos;ll bet your new friend dan
would love to hear all about how classy you are .
dan ? what ...
what , you really think she would tell him ?
it &apos;s blair .
i can &apos;t believe you told her .
you just expected me to keep it a secret ?
yes , nate. there &apos;s nothing wrong with keeping a secret
if the truth is gonna hurt someone .
that &apos;s a hell of a way
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t realize all of a sudden you &apos;re the most honest guy on the planet .
well , it just seems to me that you &apos;re the one
that doesn &apos;t want to be seen together in public .
no , i do want be seen together
i just don &apos;t want to see you with anyone else .
tell your harem of shop girls and models
that you &apos;re seeing someone .
i am , but those conversations take a little time .
well , they &apos;ve got nothing but time ,
bart. they &apos;re 25 .
excuse me .
dan , wait
look , i really don &apos;t appreciate your lurking in the shadows ,
eavesdropping on my private conversation .
what ? no. no , no , i wasn &apos;t . i was looking for serena .
well , i don &apos;t see her. do you ?
no , which is why i was looking
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing here
or what you think you heard ...
nothing . i heard nothing .
but serena doesn &apos;t know .
and neither do i , okay ?
so now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m gonna go back inside ,
not tell anyone a thing and mind my own business .
dan .
hi . i &apos;m blair waldorf , serena &apos;s friend .
oh , hey. yeah , uh , do you happen to know where she is ?
as a matter of fact , i do. blair .
serena , there you are. uh , where were you ?
she was waiting in a hotel room for my boyfriend
about why we weren &apos;t talking .
that doesn &apos;t sound any smarter the second time .
why weren &apos;t you talking ?
does this have anything to do with why you were waiting for serena this morning ?
you were what ?
and here i thought you were waiting for me .
oh , exactly what the situation needs , chuck
now what is going on here ?
we were just getting into that .
blair , please , don &apos;t do this .
sorry. oh , do you wanna tell him ?
i &apos;ll tell him .
you know ?
i know everything .
and apparently , i know nothing .
look , dan , it--it was a long time ago ,
and i regret it .
look , serena , stop trying to pretend you &apos;re a good girl .
so you slept with your best friend &apos;s boyfriend .
i kind of admire you for it .
is that true ?
well , then she ran away and lied about it .
i just thought you should know
before you fall head over heels for your perfect girl and her perfect world ,
and then get left all alone with no one
but your cabbage patch kid .
cabbage patch ?
did you talk to my sister ?
ah , yes , little jenny .
i do believe she and i have some unfinished business .
you stay away from her .
poor daniel. so little time , so many sluts to defend .
it &apos;s fine. it &apos;s fine. everyone can stop looking .
he &apos;s a jerk ...
but it &apos;s my fault , and--and i &apos;m leaving .
i--i &apos;ll go with you .
actually , i &apos;d prefer if you didn &apos;t .
hope you &apos;re happy .
not even close .
looks like it &apos;s just you and me .
apparently , my room is available .
some might call this a &quot; fustercluck , &quot;
but on the upper east side , we call it sunday afternoon .
dan , wait . i &apos;m so sorry .
there &apos;s no-- there &apos;s no need to be .
really , i shouldn &apos;t have come here today .
i made a mistake .
no , you didn &apos;t .
look , i &apos;m sorry about blair and chuck
it &apos;s not about blair or chuck .
i mean , it is , but it &apos;s--
it &apos;s not just them .
no , i know. trust me , i know .
this world--it--it &apos;s crazy .
yeah , it--it is ...
and you &apos;re a part of it .
what , and you didn &apos;t know that ?
i don &apos;t know. i @-@ i thought you were different .
well , i &apos;m sorry
i &apos;m not who you thought i was ,
but what &apos;s happened is in the past ,
you know , and all i can do is try to change .
but if you can &apos;t accept that ,
then , you know , you &apos;re not who i thought you were .
well , i guess we both made mistakes .
hi. hey , jen said you went looking for serena .
did you find her ?
mm. yeah , yeah , i found her , and , uh , and then i lost her .
oh , uh , that &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s fine. it &apos;s fine. really , it &apos;s all for the best .
serena and her friends and her family ...
her whole world ...
turns out it wasn &apos;t for me .
wait , dan. what happened ?
did you tell blair waldorf about cedric ?
i ...
it may have come up .
you can &apos;t trust these people , jen .
don &apos;t tell &apos; em anything .
they &apos;re nice flowers .
they &apos;re hydrangeas .
look , blair ,
either you try to forgive me and move on ...
or we end it .
well , serena &apos;s mystery man is a mystery no longer .
his name is ... oh , who cares ?
now that he and s. are over ,
so are his 15 minutes .
but his sister jenny
was spotted with a new dress ... gifted from blair herself .
everyone knows an eleanor original
is the uniform of b . &apos; s private army .
but will j. be a loyal soldier
or will she side with s . &apos; s rebel forces ?
and as for s. herself ,
we hear that she left today &apos;s brunch with nofriends ,
no boy and nowhere left to run .
it looks like the ultimate insider
has become a total outsider .
it &apos;s your move , serena ,
and you know who will be watching
gossip girl .
