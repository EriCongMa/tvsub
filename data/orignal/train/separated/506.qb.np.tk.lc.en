lockdown
hey , smitty , anyone heard from rivers yet ?
negative .
i don &apos;t mind the overtime ,
but you &apos;d think he &apos;d at least call .
we &apos;ll advise if he checks in .
copy . i &apos;m gonna take a leak .
hey , smitty , i got something down here
by the utility closet .
it looks like it might be blood .
did you say blood ?
yeah . i &apos;m gonna check it out and then , uh ...
you &apos;ll want to send somebody down , though .
copy .
oh , my god .
rivers .
we found him last night .
it &apos;s the second guard in 3 months .
both stabbed in the neck with a sock stuffed in their mouth .
yeah , that &apos;s what made me think to call you .
the sock could be some kind of signature , couldn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s possible .
forgive me , warden tate ,
but this is a prison we &apos;re talking about .
isn &apos;t every inch of the place covered with surveillance ?
it &apos;s an older facility ,
and we &apos;re still making updates to the system ,
but officer hightower was killed in a riot incident
where the inmates temporarily disabled the cameras .
well , this could be a retaliatory act against the administration .
in which case it could happen again .
yeah , that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m afraid of .
look , i only took over 6 months ago ,
and two men are dead .
they had families .
warden , we &apos;re here to help however we can .
let us discuss it with our team
and we &apos;ll get back to you as soon as possible .
yeah , sounds good .
thank you both .
federal penitentiary .
technically it is on our watch .
a privately owned penitentiary outsourced by the doj .
how &apos;d you meet this guy ?
at a conference in d.c.
he was a lobbyist for the same company
that owns the prison .
why go from a lobbyist on the hill
to a prison warden in east texas ?
apparently he got a nice salary package for taking the job .
and now he &apos;s in over his head .
2,000 inmates , and probably half of them
already in there for violent crimes .
well , the good news and the bad news is ,
we &apos;ve already got our suspect pool .
&quot; when the prison doors are opened ,
the real dragon will fly out . &quot;
ho chi minh .
officers keith rivers and rudy hightower ,
both career prison guards , both married , kids ,
nothing out of the ordinary .
the uniform itself could be the target .
kill a guard , any guard , it doesn &apos;t matter which one .
and what about the sock in the mouth ?
it might be some kind of warning to keep quiet , you know ,
like , put a sock in it .
it could have also just been a gag
to literally keep the victims quiet .
well , either way ,
we &apos;re probably looking at multiple unsubs .
this would be very difficult to pull off alone .
multiple unsubs in a prison ,
sounds like a gang .
and gangs have gang leaders
and the murders could lead back to one of them ,
and by them , i mean him .
julio watson , founder of the southside crip nation .
he transferred in a month before the murders started .
wonder if it &apos;s a coincidence .
excuse me , sir .
even i am befuddled .
i found almost nothing on this prison ,
but this is what i do know .
the reagan federal penitentiary was opened in 1969
just outside of liberty , texas .
oh , the irony , i know .
and then it was scheduled to be shut down ,
but citadel corrections company bought it
a year ago from uncle sam .
the business of incarceration
is extremely lucrative and virtually recession @-@ proof .
the citadel corrections company
has more than quadrupled their holdings
since they were founded 20 years ago .
they now have 19 facilities all across the country .
59,603 prisoners in their charge .
guess i had it wrong all this time .
crime does pay .
two vehichles coming in .
close it up !
agent hotchner , it &apos;s good to see you , sir .
thank you again for coming all this way .
hopefully we can help , warden .
oh , agent rossi ,
hey , it &apos;s great to meet you .
likewise , warden .
this is our team .
this is agent callahan ,
agent jareau , dr. reid ,
and agent morgan .
this is captain shavers , head of security .
he can help you with anything you need .
call me dale , please .
and welcome . it &apos;s good to have you all here .
right this way .
gun lockers for your weapons and ammo are right here .
obviously we had to move officer rivers &apos; body ,
but per your request ,
we left everything else as is .
thank you .
thank you for coming .
polinsky , i want those sign @-@ up forms logged in
before the next shift .
make sure we get them visitor badges .
close .
if you don &apos;t mind , i got a few things i need to tend to ,
but i &apos;ll catch up with you asap .
i &apos;m sorry there &apos;s no cell signal inside the walls .
we had to jam it .
you got inmates smuggling phones in ?
yeah , it &apos;s been a problem , one of many .
what about wi @-@ fi ?
we got you set up as close to the router as possible ,
but it &apos;s still glitchy . it drives me nuts .
back when i worked on the hill ,
i couldn &apos;t survive without my phone .
i got a teenager at home who knows exactly how you feel .
well , we have got a good old @-@ fashioned land line
and a fax machine for you , though .
i thought i was the only one that still used those .
and there actually is a pretty decent signal outside ,
so you &apos;re not completely cut off .
we &apos;ll provide all your meals .
food &apos;s not much to speak of , especially breakfast ,
so you may want to grab something over by your hotel and bring it in .
excuse me , doctor , when &apos;s the coroner coming to pick him up ?
i don &apos;t know .
any idea how long the autopsy will take ?
no , none .
ok , then , is there anything you can tell us ?
sorry . i &apos;m not out here that much .
excuse me , please .
check this out .
his fingers are broken .
that other guard , hightower , his fingers were broken , too .
and if i remember right ,
7 , just like this guy .
the m.e. said hightower &apos;s were defensive wounds .
probably happened in the struggle during the riot .
i don &apos;t see any obvious defensive wounds on him .
yeah . we need an autopsy .
good luck with that .
yeah , well , i &apos;m gonna go light a fire
under dr. helpful out here .
i bet all the inmates know exactly what areas
are covered by surveillance .
that they do .
the lock &apos;s not picked ,
so they either stole a key from a guard
or took one off the victim .
but how did they get him all the way back here ?
they either waited or lured him here somehow .
and look at this shelf . it &apos;s pretty high .
it had to take at least two attackers to get him up here .
what &apos;s the deal with the shoddy surveillance ?
i mean , this is a big hallway . no cameras ?
ask our corporate office .
maybe you &apos;ll have better luck than i did .
what do you mean by that ?
it &apos;s ok . you can level with us .
i requested cameras , dozens of times ,
but i got shot down because upgrades cost money .
you want me to level with you , ok .
these ccc college boys have their heads up their asses .
the warden &apos;s a fair enough man , but he &apos;s one of them .
20 years i &apos;ve been here .
they don &apos;t care about us or this place .
the only thing they care about is the bottom line ,
and my guys are dying because of it .
captain , de @-@ seg supervisors are ready for you in the main office .
copy that , i &apos;ll be right up .
can you two find your way back ?
yeah . we &apos;re good .
you know , callahan , there &apos;s one other possibility we need to consider .
what if a guard is actually involved ?
it just means we &apos;ve got to be careful who we can trust .
yo , gene , you got my carnitas ?
how long you think they &apos;re gonna keep us on lockdown ?
a watched pot never boils .
a watched pot never what ?
nobody asked you about no pot , man .
what does that even mean ?
damn !
about time . i &apos;m starvin &apos; .
come here , boy .
the feds are here .
what ?
you heard me .
and you better keep your damn mouth shut .
mr. watson . sorry for the wait .
i hope y &apos;all know i had to rearrange my entire schedule .
i have back @-@ to @-@ back meetings and a conference call after lunch .
well , we appreciate your understanding .
what &apos;s up , bro ?
they bring you in here so we could relate ?
not exactly , bro .
we just want to ask you a few questions
about officers hightower and rivers .
i ain &apos;t do it .
you didn &apos;t do what ?
i ain &apos;t killed &apos; em .
and we should just believe you .
come on , you both know if it was me ,
i &apos;d be braggin &apos; about it already .
what i got to hide ? what , they gonna give me more time ?
i got life plus 30 already .
that mean after i die , i gotta be back up in here anyway .
all right , then , do you know anything
about who might be involved ?
nah , man , me and my people , we don &apos;t mess with socks .
it &apos;s melodramatic .
you know about that ?
i know about a lot .
just not who did it .
and you &apos;re not exactly crying over it , though , are you ?
turn up the pressure there , hightower .
he can take more than that .
come on , julio , stand up .
come on ! come on !
he can take it . turn it up .
aren &apos;t you soaked , julio ?
come on , get up .
stand up , man .
them two cops ,
world &apos;s better off without &apos; em .
according to who ? you ?
me and everybody else in here we &apos;ll agree .
ask around .
due respect , julio ,
but you &apos;re a mass murderer who copped a plea
and flipped on your friends in exchange for a lesser sentence .
you &apos;re not exactly what i would call a reliable character witness .
believe whatever you want .
but trust , i hated them pigs .
matter of fact , i wish i had done it .
it would have given me something to do to pass the time .
there &apos;s a couple more guys that we should talk to .
so far no one knows anything ,
but if they do , they &apos;re just not talking .
maybe this has nothing to do with gang @-@ related activity .
the one thing they all have in common
is no love for hightower or rivers .
this could be personal .
maybe someone had a beef with those two .
we need to complete our profiles . the answer &apos;s in there .
uh ... how much time do you need ?
126 minutes , approximately .
well , hurry .
we should go help finish those interviews .
i &apos;ll join you in a minute ,
but first i &apos;m gonna go outside and check in with garcia .
the preliminary m.e. report on rivers
says his fingers were broken postmortem .
7 broken fingers could mean anything .
the number 7 is widely regarded as being lucky ,
and it plays a ubiquitous role
in most of the world &apos;s major religions ,
not to mention astrology ,
astronomy , literature , music .
the interesting thing about the number 7
is that it &apos;s not only a factorial prime--
reid , did you get through the files ?
i did , and i found a discrepancy .
there seems to be a prisoner unaccounted for .
devon white . at first i almost missed it
because there &apos;s not even a file for him ,
but i triple @-@ checked the inmate manifest ,
cross @-@ checked that with the attendance logs ,
and it turns out that one day 3 months ago he just vanished .
3 months ago was right before hightower was killed .
we need to find him .
devon white . i ...
yeah , i--i didn &apos;t know him personally .
i remember him .
d @-@ block . he was transferred to nixon ,
and that &apos;s one of their facilities just outside of pensacola .
may i ?
any idea why this
wasn &apos;t with the other records ?
who knows ? i can &apos;t get them to do it right over at corporate .
we &apos;d like to arrange to speak to him .
he was here before the first murder ,
and that &apos;s always the most significant .
i &apos;ll make some calls .
thank you .
wilson on c for shavers .
captain , do you copy ?
go for shavers .
uh , sir , we &apos;ve got a situation down here .
what happened ?
there &apos;s , uh , there &apos;s been another murder .
7 broken fingers and a sock in the mouth .
this time there &apos;s evidence of sexual assault .
we didn &apos;t see that with the other victims .
who was he ?
randall jefferson jones , inmate number 91751 .
he was a serial rapist in the 10th year of a 20 @-@ year @-@ sentence .
how did this happen again ?
these men are supposed to be locked down ?
he was privileged status , sir .
how did a serial rapist end up privileged ?
jones gave us information from time to time .
that explains the shift in victimology
and the high level of violence .
well , at least we know the killers must be someone
with privileged status on this cell block , right ?
yeah , that &apos;s over 100 guys ,
and this shot could have been called from anywhere .
is there surveillance in this area ?
not inside the bathroom itself but the hallway outside .
all right , we &apos;ll need to review the footage immediately .
you got it .
doing this over here is incredibly bold .
it &apos;s practically a taunt .
or a message .
to who ?
us .
chocolate thunder , chocolate thunder ,
where have you been ? i &apos;ve left like 4 messages ?
i &apos;m sorry , mama . you know there &apos;s no signal inside .
that is cruel and unusual punishment .
you know that if i don &apos;t phone flirt with you
at least twice a day , i get all itchy .
promise me you &apos;ll check in more .
hey , what do you think i &apos;m doing right now ? come on , breathe .
you got anything for me ?
yes , of course i do .
i have some decidedly weird information
about the first two victims , hightower and rivers .
they , for the past year , have matching bank activity ,
and a lot of it .
like one guy would withdraw cash and the other one
would deposit the exact same amount ,
sometimes as low as 200 bucks ,
a couple times as high as 2,000 .
they even wrote checks to each other .
if i was a betting woman , i would bet that these two
have been paying off bets .
that &apos;s nice work , baby girl . good job .
thank you . hey , take care of yourself .
come on , you know me .
yeah , i do . that &apos;s why i &apos;m saying it .
can &apos;t see anything on the surveillance footage .
they cut the lights in the hallway
and the cameras don &apos;t have i.r.
how &apos;d they get access to the power ?
same way they got into that closet .
one of the guards is definitely in on this .
maybe not willingly . there have been cases
where inmates have manipulated prison staff with threats .
guys , i &apos;ve been looking for connections between our victims ,
and i think i may have found something .
before our dead convict , randall jefferson jones ,
achieved privileged status ,
he just happened to be cellmates with devon white .
ok , so why does devon &apos;s name keep popping up ?
i thought the same thing , so i kept searching ,
which oddly enough led me back to hightower and rivers .
they filed more disciplinary write @-@ ups
than any other guards in the entire prison ,
and guess who got a lot of them .
devon white .
yeah , but for relatively minor infractions--
improperly made bed , non @-@ regulation clothing .
they once put him in solitary confinement
for hiding candy bars under his bed .
i wonder why they rode him so hard .
here &apos;s the strange thing , though .
he has no history of physical violence in his past ,
yet he made frequent visits to the infirmary
for injuries related to fighting .
do we have medical files here ?
no , we need to check the infirmary .
there it is .
ok . devon white .
looks like he was in here quite a bit .
broken nose , stitches , missing tooth .
he may not have been a violent guy when he got here ,
but this place certainly turned him into one .
this man was sexually assaulted several times ,
but why am i not seeing anything in here about a rape kit ?
no evidence collection , nothing .
probably didn &apos;t want to file a report .
see it all the time .
do you think this has anything to do
with the sexual assault of the third victim ?
you mean like an eye for an eye ?
it &apos;s a good bet .
we need to find devon white .
meantime , we need to talk to someone who knew him .
somebody in this place knows something .
hell , yeah , i remember devon ,
from up in the library .
you two were pretty good buddies ?
he &apos;s the one helped me get my g.e.d.
he &apos;s a good dude .
they transferred him up out of here .
he all right ?
mr. sam pritchett .
i &apos;m agent david rossi .
how you doin &apos; ?
can &apos;t complain .
well , you could , but who &apos;d be listening , right ?
can i get you something ? water ? coffee ?
ok .
i , uh ,
i wanted to ask you about devon white .
it says here you worked in the library with him .
till they assigned me to another work detail .
i see you worked there almost 20 years .
why the change ?
not my choice .
so did that have anything to do with officer hightower ?
you know , i ask that because i see his name on the work transfer .
hi there , sam . you miss us ?
up .
got a lot of books .
get over here .
got a lot of books , sam .
don &apos;t you know you &apos;re not supposed to have books ?
it &apos;s against the rules .
i go where they tell me to go .
right .
so what can you tell me about devon ?
good kid , hard worker ,
loved to read .
not like most of these other knuckleheads .
so you two were pretty close .
ah , you know , liked to look out for him .
and why is that ?
some of these young cats that come in here ,
they get overwhelmed .
you got to makeup for it .
what you doing , newbie ?
where you from , brother ?
what &apos;s up , young blood ?
sam .
devon .
so he was a good kid .
well , that , uh ,
that &apos;s funny , because
i got a stack of disciplinary write @-@ ups
that say different .
in fact , officer hightower
and another guy , rivers ,
they wrote devon up a lot ,
even took him to the infirmary for fighting .
i don &apos;t know nothin &apos; about that .
well , did they have some kind of problem with devon ?
you &apos;d have to ask them .
they &apos;re both dead .
you don &apos;t say .
ok , then .
what are you not telling me ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m sitting here
looking at you looking at me ,
and my gut says
you know exactly what &apos;s going on in here .
i don &apos;t know nothin &apos; .
before the ccc took over ,
devon white was a model inmate .
he never got written up .
not one infirmary visit .
none of that started until officers hightower
and rivers were hired .
and that &apos;s right around the same time
they started exchanging all that money .
that bank activity has to have something to do with this .
if they were paying off bets ,
what could they be betting on ?
some kind of regular poker game , maybe .
sports , maybe a fight .
what if its some sort of sanctioned violence
right here at the prison ?
you mean like a fight club ?
i &apos;ve heard of that happening in prisons .
maybe it was their own sadistic version of that using inmates .
that could explain why devon was fighting .
so the sock in the mouth and the 7 broken fingers
must be related to a specific event .
and if i &apos;m guessing ,
an event involving devon white .
our presence here is forcing the issue .
up .
captain , i got something .
take him downstairs .
get in there .
i should have figured it out sooner .
now i &apos;m gonna give you a chance to come clean .
who was helping you ?
who was helping you ?
who was it ?
who ? !
you gonna make me disappear , too ?
you better tell me who it was .
they &apos;re gonna figure it out .
they &apos;re gonna find you , you son of a bitch .
this is your last chance . who was it ?
maybe me and you can share a cell someday .
oh , my--what happened ?
son of a bitch went berserk .
damn near bit my nose off .
i bopped him pretty good ,
but i guess he must have caught his head
on the door or something when he went down .
we , uh , found all that hidden in his cell .
oh , damn it .
go get that cut taken care of .
no , i &apos;m good , sir .
i &apos;d like to stay and help .
shavers , you &apos;ve done enough . go .
captain , i &apos;ll meet you in the infirmary .
i have a few questions .
all right . this won &apos;t take long .
i &apos;ll come find you .
his name is patrick butler ,
inmate number 312773 .
found the same socks , same shanks .
this must be our guy .
well , warden , we profiled this was the work of a group .
if butler was involved ,
we &apos;ve only found one of the killers .
well , i &apos;m gonna go share the news with corporate .
they &apos;ll be happy we &apos;re making progress .
was butler a violent criminal ?
not until he came here .
he was doing 5 years
for using a toy gun to rob 5 banks
in 3 different states ,
but his sentence got bumped up to 20
after he killed another inmate .
just like devon white .
comes in nonviolent and then something goes wrong .
hey , wait , guys , look at the cell number .
maybe it &apos;s not 7 fingers ,
maybe it &apos;s 3 on one hand ,
4 on the other . 34 .
well , i wonder what else must have happened down here .
you really think this butler guy did it ?
it &apos;s possible .
and our profile may have led shavers right to it .
but if this is about foul play ,
why would shavers want him dead ?
he may have known too much about something the
captain &apos;s trying to hide .
you think the warden knows about all this ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i think he &apos;s just trying to save his job .
so what &apos;s our next move ?
we proceed as planned .
we keep conducting interviews
until we find out what happened to devon white ,
and then we figure out if butler or shavers
had anything to do with it .
hello , tom .
i &apos;m not gonna say anything .
i already told you that .
i know .
i was just saying hello .
oh , hey , you know ,
how is that beautiful little girl of yours doing ?
she &apos;s gonna be 8 soon ?
that &apos;s a great age .
enjoy it . they grow quick .
next thing you know ,
they &apos;re gone .
shavers just radioed .
he &apos;s on his way down .
it &apos;s taking him long enough .
have garcia monitor his cell phone .
that way we &apos;ll know if he tries to leave .
you really think he &apos;ll try and run ?
he might if he &apos;s got something to hide .
mr. ortiz , have a seat .
i want to ask you a few questions about devon white .
so you worked on his cell block , right ?
when was the last time you saw him ?
do you remember anything special about devon ?
oh , man , you got to be kiddin &apos; me .
well , of course i get the affirmative action dude .
why couldn &apos;t you be one of the chicks ?
it &apos;s ok if i call you tom ?
so you reported directly to officer rivers ?
he was my block commander .
do you remember this inmate ?
yeah , he looks familiar .
you took him to the infirmary 4 different times .
his name &apos;s devon white .
he was on d @-@ building .
yeah , yeah , devon .
i remember him .
do you remember anything about his transfer ?
how about the infirmary visits ?
nope , uh , nothing .
you ok ?
would you like some water ?
yeah . yeah , sure .
you know , tom ,
well , it &apos;s just--
it &apos;s a little odd .
devon lived on your cell block ...
and you saw him at least 5 times a week .
but all you got is ,
&quot; yeah , he looks familiar &quot; ?
there &apos;s a lot of guys on d @-@ block .
you mind ?
ok , look , i &apos;m just gonna cut to the chase here ,
because you seem like a man who is scared
and carrying a burden .
maybe it &apos;s just stress ,
i don &apos;t know ,
but it seems like you &apos;re hiding something
and it &apos;s eating you up .
is there something you want to tell us , tom ?
something maybe about cell number 34 .
you gotta keep my daughter safe .
please .
hey , weeks !
i got a proposition for you .
shavers and his guys ,
they &apos;re like their own little gang .
what did they do to devon ?
we don &apos;t have all day , polinsky .
1 , 2 , 3 .
they told me if i talked , they &apos;d hurt my daughter .
ok , tom , how did all this get started ?
they &apos;d round up a few inmates .
misfits .
none of them affiliated .
they &apos;d pick the quiet ones
&apos;cause they knew they &apos;d be weak .
they made devon and butler fight .
those two , i guess they were , uh , close .
come on , butler .
like more than friends .
and when they refused .
come on now .
they only got it worse from shavers and his gang .
get in there .
come on , mix it up .
get up !
take it .
take it .
i wasn &apos;t supposed to be down there ,
but i was looking for rivers .
polinsky .
devon &apos;s lying there , all bloody ,
and butler &apos;s freakin &apos; out .
they made you get rid of the body
so you were an accessory ?
you helped them kill hightower , rivers , and jones , too ?
i couldn &apos;t kill anybody .
it--it was butler
and i don &apos;t know who else .
and i just--i just got &apos; em keys and stuff .
will you testify to all this ?
yeah .
how was randall jones involved ?
jones , their lap dog ,
he &apos;d help them out , round up guys ,
get them information .
whatever they needed .
get him !
hold still .
ok !
ok .
you lived in a cell next to devon , is that correct ?
excuse me , agents .
a personal body alarm was activated in a @-@ block ,
but we can &apos;t seem to get access .
a @-@ block . that &apos;s where morgan and kate are .
check it . check it .
locked !
you smell good .
you get that bitch under control !
just let her go , man .
oh , i like her .
handle it . in here !
come on , let &apos;s move .
go , all right ?
gather &apos; round !
i want everyone to see this .
give me that .
do it .
hey , i want to have some fun with this one first .
leave her alone !
hurry up ! this won &apos;t take long .
weeks !
what the hell you doin &apos; , man ?
mind your business !
i &apos;m makin &apos; it my business .
this ain &apos;t your show .
now , go on , get out of here !
this ain &apos;t got nothin &apos; to do with you , watson .
the hell it don &apos;t .
this is feds , you idiots .
anything happens to them , we all end up on death row .
listen to him , man , he &apos;s right .
shut up !
nothing good can come from hurting us .
if you let us go , it can help some of you .
we know about shavers .
we have enough to bring this whole place down .
with your help , shavers , all of them .
shut up .
maybe even the entire
citadel corrections company .
do &apos; em , weeks . damn you , do &apos; em .
he &apos;s got the entire block locked down .
there &apos;s no way to get in or out .
can &apos;t we shut the system down ?
it &apos;s in override .
the only way to do that is from inside the booth .
open it .
it &apos;s bolted from inside .
just open the door . we can work this out .
come on , dale , let &apos;s do this the easy way .
dale , no !
stay out of this , watson .
it &apos;s too late . i &apos;m already in .
somebody , please ...
he needs help .
oh , i got his help .
let go of him !
i just want to help him .
down , down , down . everybody down .
get medics in here ! he &apos;s still alive !
