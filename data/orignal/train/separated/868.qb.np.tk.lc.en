it &apos;s a funny thing about dads --
they always tend to be creatures of habit .
at least , my father was .
he liked what he liked , and he hated change .
ever since i can remember , he wore the same shoes ,
he ate the same breakfast .
i &apos;m home !
don &apos;t anybody bother me !
and every day , he &apos;d come home at 5 : 15,
park his pants at the door , sit in the same chair ,
and watch the same show .
if you tried to change anything ,
he &apos;d fight you tooth and nail .
that &apos;s why my mom created the illusion
everything stayed the same , but it wasn &apos;t .
that magical pair of shoes that never wore out --
she secretly replaced them every eight months .
that laissez @-@ faire attitude about his personal grooming --
she tended to that , too .
she even managed to switch him
to low @-@ fat cream cheese without him noticing .
this tastes funny .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
okay .
yep , beverly goldberg had always been the puppet master ,
and my dad had no idea .
beverly !
that is , until the day she got a new chair .
beverly ! beverly goldberg !
what the hell is sitting where my chair should be ?
surprise !
i thought it was time for an upgrade .
don &apos;t you just love it ?
where &apos;s my chair -- the one i &apos;ve been sitting in for 20 years ?
i donated it to goodwill .
without telling me ? ! why would you do that ? !
honey , you &apos;re always complaining about how your back hurts .
it &apos;s that old chair .
you never liked that chair .
you &apos;ve always been jealous of what we &apos;ve had together .
&quot; we &quot; ? who &apos;s &quot; we &quot; ?
me and mr . chair . that &apos;s right , it had a name .
well , it &apos;s not a very good one .
mine is top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line .
you &apos;re gonna love how comfy it is .
it &apos;s so spongy .
honey , you &apos;re gonna have to trust me on this .
i bought it for your own good .
i can &apos;t breathe . can &apos;t breathe .
well , stop sitting like that .
you &apos;re sitting uncomfortably on purpose .
it &apos;s engulfing me .
stop it !
those are exaggerated body movements .
it was march 7 , 1980 @-@ something .
and like every day , i rode the bus .
back then , this was the wild west --
no seatbelts , no security cameras ,
no one to stop the one dude who made your life miserable .
for me , it was an eighth grader named j.c. spink .
look who it is -- adam gold @-@ nerd .
he may have been tiny , but he was terrible .
can you please lay off today , j.c. ?
i forgot my gym shorts and had to run the mile in jeans .
i have a really bad chafe .
oh , man . i am so sorry to hear that .
hey , everybody .
adam has got some sting @-@ y thighs .
so if i see one spitball hit this kid ,
you will have to deal with me .
thanks , dude . that &apos;s -- that &apos;s really --
everybody get their asses in their seats --
especially you , spink !
yes , sir .
mind if we share ?
i was plastered up against that window for the next 20 minutes .
and then i saw barry doing what he did best -- flipping out .
no ! no ! no , no , no !
what the hell is his deal ?
where the hell is my sports illustrated football phone ? !
damn it . where ? ! where ? ! where ? !
unreal ! unreal !
that &apos;s my big brother , barry .
he &apos;s clinically insane .
for real ?
the doctors gave up on him .
he &apos;s too crazy for their modern medicine .
where is my phone ? !
and if you don &apos;t back off , i &apos;m bringing him on this bus ,
and he &apos;ll smear you against a window .
j.c. was running scared .
now i just had to get barry on board .
unfortunately , he was a little preoccupied
with more urgent matters .
the dude on tv said
my football phone would be here in eight weeks .
it &apos;s been 10 !
i mean , what am i supposed to do , huh ?
make phone calls on a phone @-@ shaped phone
like some kind of animal ?
i say good day to you , sir .
rough stuff , man .
i can see you &apos;re going through a lot .
speaking of difficult problems ,
is there any way you would start
riding the bus to school with me again ?
why would i ride the bus with you
when i carpool with erica
and her smoking @-@ hot friend lainey
who secretly loves me but is too afraid to act on it ?
look .
there &apos;s this kid who &apos;s making my life hell .
and if you were there , he &apos;d leave me alone .
i do have an air of badass about me .
so you &apos;ll do it ?
i &apos;ve given it a lot of thought ,
and i &apos;m respectfully declining your stupid @-@ ass invitation .
please ! i &apos;m begging you !
i &apos;ll give you all my garbage pail kids .
see ? they &apos;re like baseball cards , but hilarious .
one day , these will be worth millions .
they &apos;re not .
all right . fine . whatever . i &apos;m in .
for real ?
listen , bro .
you &apos;re literally the most annoying , un @-@ athletic ,
four @-@ eyed , almost girl @-@ like dork i &apos;ve ever met .
but you &apos;re my brother , and no one beats you up but me .
i was touched , insulted , and kind of angry ,
but i &apos;d gotten what i wanted .
no , stop !
once the chair molds to your body , there &apos;s no going back !
it &apos;s imprinted to you for life !
wha ?
the first 48 hours are the most important .
get up ! get up !
aw , damn it .
now it &apos;s got your tiny girl imprint .
this is truly the worst thing to ever happen to me .
okay . i &apos;m gonna leave you to whatever this is .
what is that pitch ? !
i see you !
oh , crap !
don &apos;t make me get up !
i don &apos;t like getting up !
get the hell outta here !
run !
his beloved chair was gone , and my dad was livid ,
so he decided to strike back where she &apos;d feel it most --
the kitchen .
what is this ? w @-@ what &apos;s happening ?
where &apos;s my stove ?
surprise !
don &apos;t you love it ? !
murray , where is my stove ?
you know , you &apos;re always complaining
about slaving away in the kitchen ,
so i got you a gift .
dinner &apos;s in a half an hour .
what the hell am i supposed to cook with ?
the microwave -- a new miracle of technology
that magically cooked food in a tenth of the time .
and , man , did it boil my mom .
my god . how does it work ?
i know you &apos;re gonna think i &apos;m crazy when i say this .
magic .
i &apos;d buy that .
totally . i agree .
it &apos;s not magic , people .
it &apos;s an evil food box .
hot . it &apos;s hot . it &apos;s hot .
popcorn in four minutes !
a cure for polio , a man on the moon ,
and now this .
hey ! are you nuts ?
that food &apos;s been radiated . it &apos;s like poison in a bag .
bev , i did this for your own good .
that small wonder over there
is gonna make your life so much better .
you &apos;re playing a very dangerous game .
are you sure you want to take me on ?
oh , i &apos;m sure --
in honor of my fallen comrade , mr . chair .
your fallen comrade smelled like an envelope full of farts !
i just heated up a lasagna
in the time it took for your relationship to collapse .
while my mom was trying not to go nuclear ,
things were about to blow up on the bus .
hey , gold @-@ nerd !
look whose brother didn &apos;t show up .
time for target practice .
i think it &apos;s time you leave my little brother alone
or i &apos;ll spit at you ...
without a ball !
it &apos;ll be all spit .
no ball ?
c @-@ come on , man . that &apos;s crazy .
that &apos;s right .
and there &apos;s a good chance i have mono ,
&apos;cause i sleep an insane amount .
listen up , little bus people .
there &apos;s a new sheriff in town ,
and his name is barry norman goldberg .
if you have anything to say to my little bro ,
you say it to me first .
except you , tyler . you can speak to me directly .
he &apos;s cool . we were in &quot; pippin &quot; together .
i am quite the song @-@ and @-@ dance man .
tyler , not helping !
beat it , loser .
i couldn &apos;t believe it .
after years of torturing me ,
barry actually came to my rescue .
dude , thank you .
no problem .
now give me your lunch .
being awesome makes me hungry .
you &apos;re supposed to use the spreader .
consider it used .
and just like that , my new bodyguard became my new bully .
and at home , my mom and dad &apos;s battle had become a war .
his tightie @-@ whitie drawer had been invaded by boxers .
here you go , sweetie .
straight out of the radioactive heat box .
it &apos;s like eating egg @-@ flavored newspaper .
all right , we need to talk .
oh , morning , sweetie .
would you like some microwaved egg rubber ?
no . i would like my underpants back .
oh , well , you &apos;re holding them .
no , no . these are not my underpants .
mine are white , tight , and they keep the fellas in place .
not hungry .
well , now you have boxers .
you know , scientific research shows
that you need to let your privates breathe ,
especially if we &apos;re gonna have more kids one day .
first , i will never wear shorts under my pants .
it &apos;s madness !
and second , having more children
is literally my worst nightmare !
you &apos;ll understand when you have horrible kids .
sweetie , i &apos;m only doing this for your own good .
you want war ?
you got one .
my mom thought she had struck the death blow
by taking away my dad &apos;s tightie @-@ whities .
little did she know , things were about to get ugly --
real ugly .
well , well .
look who finally came around on the boxers .
nope .
but you &apos;re dressed for work .
yep .
so everything &apos;s just all free in there ?
yep .
no !
you &apos;re an adult man in society . you need another layer !
people won &apos;t see it , but they &apos;ll sense it .
you wanted my boys to breathe .
well , they &apos;re taking a big breath .
that &apos;s right . the three amigos , they &apos;re dining alfresco .
have a nice day .
why are you patting my head ? what &apos;s happening ?
nothing . nothing at all .
what did you do ? what did you do ?
holy
where &apos;s my aqua net ?
oh , your can of hair spray !
yeah .
i got rid of it for your own good .
did you know it &apos;s burning a hole in the ozone layer ?
i don &apos;t want to hear about some imaginary layer in the sky .
i &apos;m leading a pta meeting in 30 minutes ,
and i need to command respect with my giant hair !
you get me the chair , i &apos;ll give you the hair .
oh , you think you beat me on this ?
well , our daughter has a whole arsenal of hair products ,
and she has been dying to give me a new look .
oh , my god . what did i just hear ? is this real ?
are we finally getting rid of that terrible blonde helmet ?
okay , close your eyes . i &apos;m doing your bangs .
this is gonna be totally rad .
how &apos;s it looking ?
really , really awesome .
i know !
oh , my god !
i know !
how did this happen ? !
i don &apos;t know !
it fried my hair !
like , really quickly . it &apos;s so unhealthy .
it &apos;s like you have a head full of sagebrush .
i know !
oh , my god !
what are we gonna do about this ? !
okay . okay . let &apos;s take a chill pill .
i know i can fix this .
hi , pta .
let &apos;s talk spring fling .
what &apos;s with your hair ?
don &apos;t look at it , karen .
afternoon , friends .
you &apos;re all looking particularly small today , huh ?
hey , tyler .
cool frisbee .
my frisbee .
yo , spinkter .
give me those cheese doodles .
just take them , barry .
who &apos;s this barry you speak off ?
take them ...
bus lord .
that &apos;s right .
my plan for a bodyguard had backfired ,
and now it was up to me to banish our evil bus lord .
you know , i think i got this bus stuff handled ,
so it &apos;s probably time you go back and ride
with erica and her smoking @-@ hot friends .
dude , i &apos;m never going back .
this bus is mine now . it &apos;s my home .
now , leave me be . i find you boring .
stop !
what just happened on your shirt ?
oh , it &apos;s hypercolor .
the color changes when you touch it .
i bought it with my lawn @-@ mowing money .
i want it .
what ? no !
you &apos;ll stretch it out .
good point .
then you will use your hard @-@ earned money
to buy me one that accommodates my muscular body .
your brother &apos;s a real ass @-@ bag .
yes . yes , he is .
this whole thing &apos;s been a very eye @-@ opening experience .
i &apos;m sorry for the way i treated you .
it won &apos;t happen again .
what do you say we get barry off this bus for good ?
there &apos;s no way .
oh , there &apos;s always a way .
okay , look , everybody . come here .
we all know where we sit on this bus .
some of us are back @-@ row material .
some , like me , kind of float in the middle .
a few of us totally suck and sit in the front .
but for once ,
let &apos;s forget about what row we sit in .
for once , let &apos;s work together and take back our bus !
now who &apos;s with me ?
i am !
damn it , tyler .
you scared the crap out of me .
but i love the enthusiasm .
whoa , stop !
don &apos;t park your pants at the door .
rumor has it you &apos;re going alfresco .
oh , damn it . i forgot . i miss my underpants .
ah , you &apos;ll get used to it .
i &apos;ve been going alfresco since the &apos; 70s .
my dad didn &apos;t think he could miss anything
more than his tightie @-@ whities .
boy , was he wrong .
what the hell ?
tv &apos;s gone , mur .
yeah , i see that .
beverly took it .
i figured that .
you lost the war , pal .
stop talking .
you know , i &apos; bven watching these fish for 10 minutes ,
and i got to tell you , it &apos;s some entertaining stuff .
these two fish , they &apos;re complete opposites .
they &apos;ll never get along , but they have to .
they live in close quarters .
stop talking !
isn &apos;t it great ?
it &apos;s like being in the lobby of a benihana .
and the best part about it is
you need to constantly tend to it .
getting rid of the tv , that &apos;s nuts .
that &apos;s the glue that holds this family together .
everyone know that tv strains your eyes .
i did this for your own good .
don &apos;t do anything for my own good , okay ?
i &apos;m fine . i don &apos;t need your help .
really ? do you know how many things i do for you ,
things you don &apos;t even know anything about ?
so sue me if i want you
to sit in a chair that &apos;s not a disgusting fart trap
that ruins the scheme of my entire living room .
right there ! you did it for you .
what ?
that hurts your back -- a chair that hurts your back .
too late . you said it .
yes , that chair may be old ,
but it &apos;s because i @-@ i sit in it , i sleep in it , i eat in it ,
i even raised our children from it .
i know you do a lot for me .
you do , and i love you for it .
but you didn &apos;t get rid of that chair for me .
you got rid of that chair for you .
things were still hell on the bus ,
and now our evil emperor had new clothes .
step aside .
hands off the hypercolor .
don &apos;t touch the bod .
what are you doing ? move .
nah . i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna do that .
this isn &apos;t a request .
either you do it or i &apos;ll throw you off the bus .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong , dude .
this isn &apos;t your bus anymore .
says who ?
says me .
you owe me a frisbee .
let &apos;s get him !
yeah !
bye !
hands .
there &apos;s so many hands .
while barry was no longer king of the bus ,
my mom was looking for my father &apos;s throne .
uh , hi . i &apos;m looking for a mr. nitrous .
this is he . and it &apos;s just nitrous .
mr. nitrous is my dad .
that &apos;s nice .
listen , i was just at the goodwill ,
and i was told that you purchased something that i need .
that &apos;s my chair , sweetie .
no way , lady . i will never give you my chair .
this thing &apos;s my throne . it &apos;s shaped perfectly to my body .
not your body , my husband &apos;s body ,
which also is very similar to your body .
let me just buy it back from you .
name your price .
show me your boobs .
no !
then give me $ 1 million .
no .
i &apos;d very much like to revisit the boob conversation .
no .
show me your boobs .
no !
then give me $ 1 million .
okay , i feel like we &apos;re going in circles , nitrous .
and if you ask me this house is full of boobs .
i &apos;m looking at them .
and this place is a pigsty , and you &apos;re all dressed like slobs .
and when was the last time
one of you ate a meal with a vegetable ?
it &apos;s been a long time .
yeah . you don &apos;t need boobs . you need your laundry done .
you need your bed made .
you need to ... scour every surface in this house
before one of you gets a wicked staph infection .
it &apos;s just ... we don &apos;t know how .
mama &apos;s here , nitrous .
while my mom cleaned up her mess with my dad ,
i was hoping barry would forgive my dirty work .
hey , big news .
the mailman came . special delivery for big tasty .
wow ! great !
it &apos;s a phone ! it &apos;s a football !
whatever .
so , y @-@ you finally got it . that &apos;s cool , right ?
so that means we &apos;re cool , too , right ?
you led a mutiny against me , dude .
we are most definitely not cool .
i didn &apos;t have a choice . you went mad with power !
listen -- i know from the outside it may
seem like i have a perfect life , but the truth is
there are a lot of jerks at school
that aren &apos;t so nice to me .
it was cool to have a place where i had respect for once .
i ... didn &apos;t know that .
here .
take your garbage pail kids back .
you don &apos;t need to pay me to protect you .
i want to because you &apos;re my brother .
as for my mom , she got her hair back ... eventually .
come on . can &apos;t i give it one more try ?
and most importantly , my dad got his chair back .
oh , my god !
i can &apos;t believe it .
don &apos;t thank me . i did it for your own good .
mr. chair . mr. chair !
smells like beer .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
okay .
erica !
i &apos;ve been honking for forever .
we &apos;re gonna be late for school .
i overslept . give me a second .
what &apos;s up , lainey ? got some good news .
i &apos;m gonna ride with you guys again .
please .
got some hypercolor there , huh ?
yeah . you , uh ... digging it ?
actually ...
yes , i am .
you &apos;re looking really good , bar .
got to be honest . never thought of you this way .
oh , no .
is it hot in here ?
oh , yeah .
it &apos;s hot .
lainey , stop messing with him . let &apos;s go .
i knew she was messing with me .
i mean , come on . do i look stupid ?
