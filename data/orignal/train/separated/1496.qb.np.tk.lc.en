okay , big day for this household .
it certainly is . so exciting .
nothing like starting a new job .
or finally coming into your own at a job you already have .
the promise of something new .
the rewards finally being --
opposite things being equally good .
cheers .
yes .
i have accepted a job at the c.f.j. ,
the -- the center for justice .
not , it turns out ,
a secret headquarters for superheroes .
no , it -- it kind of is .
it &apos;s a legal @-@ aid society
founded by a law @-@ school friend of mine .
i will be an advocate for the people ,
a voice for the voiceless .
and just as important ...
oh , thank you .
tonight , i am chaperoning the spring @-@ a @-@ ding @-@ fling ,
a fundraiser , a dance ,
which , under my stewardship ,
has shattered school records .
and i added the &quot; a @-@ ding . &quot;
it used to just be called the spring fling .
i should have said my thing first .
hey , guys .
for my opening number tonight -- be honest .
does it look like i have anything on under this ?
tonight is the scarb .
southern california annual realtors &apos; banquet .
it is the banquet for southern california realtors .
literally , it &apos;s the only one .
and this guy is the only two @-@ time host --
three @-@ time .
three @-@ time host in the history of the event .
unfortunately , i have to miss it this year .
it &apos;s for the best .
she &apos;s invisible at these things .
it &apos;s tough being married to the rock star .
luckily , i lined up a substitute date .
dad . you &apos;re still up .
yeah , just working on some jokes for the banquet .
hey , how &apos;d you like to come with me ?
i would love to !
not surprised she said yes .
that girl &apos;s got real estate in her blood .
she used to come with me to open houses
when she was little .
we may have even talked about
a father / daughter partnership .
yeah , she &apos;s been drifting a little lately ,
but i think a taste
of regional real @-@ estate &apos;s most glamorous night
might just re @-@ ignite that flame .
i can &apos;t believe i have to go to this thing .
but what choice did i have ?
i would love to !
but you &apos;re not gonna have those cookies without milk , right ?
right .
come on , phil .
break area .
copier .
my stinky dog .
oh , look at you .
you just threw up recently . okay .
oh , my gosh .
that &apos;s you and michelle obama .
that &apos;s my aunt .
i am so sorry .
i don &apos;t know why i thought that --
calm down , white guilt .
it &apos;s michelle obama .
oh , good , yeah .
yeah , you &apos;ve accomplished a lot in 15 years .
professionally , yeah .
i haven &apos;t had a date in six months .
some sundays , i drive out to visit my frozen eggs .
but , on the plus side ,
i have gotten really close with my mom .
oh , look at that . i see the resemblance .
that &apos;s maya angelou .
damn it .
it &apos;s signed , mitch .
yeah . i see that .
this is gonna be fun !
i know !
i &apos;m just really looking for
you !
what was that outfit last night ?
that was a business dinner !
what is wrong with you ?
wendy , i tried .
well , try harder .
ooh , here &apos;s your office .
okay .
oh , this is nice .
yeah . dennis liked it ...
until he didn &apos;t .
i &apos;ll check on you later .
okay . all right .
let &apos;s see here .
new guy ?
uh , yes . hi . i &apos;m mitchell pritchett .
dan .
hope you don &apos;t have any plans for sunday night .
dan ! what are you still doing here ?
go !
sorry .
right .
that way !
oh , no .
i do love it in leather .
well , learn to love it in silk .
it &apos;s too hot outside to be wearing leather .
i &apos;m talking about this car .
oh , by the way ,
i do the negotiating at the dealership today .
why ?
honey , i &apos;m a businessman .
when it comes to people ,
i know how to get what i want out of them .
this watch --
the man sold it to me for half of what he was asking .
these -- a third .
these -- for free .
so , who &apos;s better at working people , mr. businessman ?
fine . we have different approaches ,
but we &apos;re both pretty good .
hello , mitch .
hey , buddy .
you look like you want to get up and walk .
late bloomer -- fine .
who cares if the other kids
call you &quot; slo @-@ joe &quot; ?
and they do , you know .
bye @-@ bye .
we &apos;re gonna have to reschedule the car shopping .
mitch has to work .
cam has to dance .
we have to sit lily .
what ?
nothing .
just -- i could have got us out of that .
stop !
eat it !
get off me !
eat the grass , cow !
hi , rhonda .
hi , mrs. dunphy .
hey , mom .
honey , it &apos;s getting very close to time for the dance .
shouldn &apos;t you go in and get changed ?
i did already .
the guys are coming by .
we &apos;re gonna ride from here .
what about you , rhonda ?
you want to go in and get cleaned up ?
i &apos;m good .
are you ?
what about that dirt on your face ?
luke , you wait here .
ride with your friends .
i will bring rhonda . come on .
just , um , give me a good shake like a dog
before you go inside .
i know .
and my dad has three tattoos .
like , &quot; why ? you &apos;re a dad . &quot;
ew ! it &apos;s so sad when parents try .
my mom double @-@ pierced one of her ears ,
and i &apos;m like , &quot; hello !
you &apos;re 50 . &quot;
it &apos;s so old , like , ancient to have an ear piercing .
uh , you two decide to go to the dance ?
well , yeah , but not really .
but , yeah .
what ?
we &apos;re going ironically
to make fun of all the kids who make a big deal out of it .
&quot; ironic &quot; ? my ass .
alex likes drew .
she &apos;s just playing it safe .
now , there are the pushy , obnoxious moms
who try and get involved ,
nudge them towards one another .
we mean well .
fancy shirt , coach tucker .
oh , thank you . you know what i like to say .
i might be coach ,
but i travel first class .
so , what would you think
about giving the opening remarks at the dance tonight ?
the arts committee has never made this much ,
and it &apos;s all because of you .
oh , you guys , when i came to this school six months ago ,
i never would have imagined you would embrace me .
excuse me ? is this a chem lab ?
because i &apos;m looking for a big reaction .
and there it is .
hi . how are --
who is this ?
how was sabbatical ?
amazing .
i &apos;m rested and ready ...
... to take another vacation .
and how are we supposed to know him ?
senor kaplan , legendary spanish teacher .
you know , my heart went out to him a little
because he left as everyone &apos;s favorite ,
and i &apos;m sure word got out about , you know ... me .
i just didn &apos;t want him to feel displaced .
okay . excuse me , big guy .
gifts for everyone .
angela , this is fresh from anuradhapura .
and , uh , karen ,
you might want to eat some chapati with that .
and this is for , um --
it &apos;s marcia .
marcia !
right , of course . i knew that .
i must have been having a &quot; senor &quot; moment .
somebody &apos;s always on .
who did this ?
what happened ?
somebody knocked my bag down
and broke my phone .
lily , do you know anything about this ?
he did it .
joe .
yep . i &apos;m going to go and play .
she lies .
how could joe pull a bag off a table ?
he can &apos;t even walk .
i &apos;ll talk to her .
why you ?
because you &apos;re such a businessman
that knows how to talk to people ?
trust me . when i get done talking to her ,
not only will she have confessed to the crime ,
i might even sell her a closet .
i remember my buddies
and i were playing rock war once .
that &apos;s a game
where you chuck rocks at each other &apos;s heads .
what could go wrong , right ?
i put one through the window
of my old man &apos;s rambler ,
and he thought my baby brother did it .
i couldn &apos;t take it ,
and i told him i did it .
it felt so good to confess ,
and my old man was so proud of me ,
i didn &apos;t even get in any trouble .
y @-@ you know ?
joe did it .
she &apos;s good .
watch and learn .
i don &apos;t think that cleavage thing
is gonna work with this one .
that &apos;s not my only trick .
hola , lily .
where did grandpa go ?
don &apos;t worry about jay .
it &apos;s only you and me here now .
so , tell me .
which one of these is your favorite ?
fine .
one by one ,
they will disappear .
sooner or later ,
we &apos;ll get to the one that you love .
ladies and gentlemen ,
he &apos;s the emperor of escrow .
he puts the toot in tooter .
let &apos;s put your hands together for
phil dunphy !
thanks for the kind introduction ,
me .
now , unlike past years ...
i &apos;m not gonna stand up here
and talk your ears off .
no , ladies and gentlemen .
you deserve more .
this year ,
i &apos;m gonna sing them off .
* i &apos;m selling away *
* set an open house for saturday *
* a gathering of agents *
* appeared in caravan *
* i &apos;m a new divorce *
* now i need a house *
* that &apos;s cat @-@ friendly *
they say the greats
never let anything affect their performance .
well , maybe the greats never had a daughter
who checked out during the third of five planned
real @-@ time , mid @-@ performance wardrobe changes .
i &apos;m not gonna lie .
it knocked me off my game .
* on the board *
is this part of it ?
no .
it &apos;s not part of it .
in law school ,
wendy kirk could be a little intense .
i always hoped that she &apos;d soften over time , but ...
... some people go the other way .
this place is a nightmare .
the conditions are deplorable ,
and no one should have to suffer
this kind of abuse on a daily basis .
what kind of tyrant has such utter disregard for human life ?
i can &apos;t do this .
you have to .
wendy needs to hear it .
yeah , but i &apos;m nervous . you know , what if she --
mitchell .
yes ! hi !
i just had a great idea .
i think you would be the perfect person to groom rex .
e @-@ excuse me ?
i just think he &apos;d really respond
to someone like you , you know ?
y @-@ you don &apos;t mind , right ?
uh , uh , no . no , not at all .
great . thanks .
will you go over and introduce yourself ?
i @-@ intro-- okay .
okay . yeah .
thank you .
hello . i &apos;m mitchell .
and , apparently , this is my job now .
oh , god , you smell .
people are looking at me .
that &apos;s because you let me make you beautiful .
stop it . am i ?
yes , you are .
have fun .
go . go .
drew . hey , drew .
having fun ?
&quot; fun &quot; ? uh ... okay .
oh , drew . drew , listen .
phil and i are gonna be out really late tonight ,
so there will not be an adult at the house
when you drop alex off ,
if you know what i mean .
yeah , don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll , uh-- i &apos;ll drop her off ,
and i won &apos;t go in .
well ... big house ,
you know ... cute daughter--
i would not be opposed to you walking her in ,
keeping her company until we get back .
like i said ,
we will not be back until late .
i hear you , mrs. dunphy .
you can trust me .
well , gonna have to trust you because we have no way
of knowing what you &apos;re gonna get up to .
in fact , if your car is blocking the driveway ,
i &apos;ll just honk twice
and wait for you to come out .
okay .
okay .
go get her , tiger . come on .
nice job , tucker .
i mean , you made so many choices
that i never would have made ,
but a lot of them are working .
oh , well , you know ,
i just watched the videos
of the many , many dances you planned
and just built off that one on idea .
hey , kids !
there are my little chalupas !
um , what did you do to rhonda ?
i cleaned her up .
no , you broke her .
i hate her like this .
she looks fantastic .
to you !
fix her . ugh , it confuses me .
oh , luke .
&quot; the house will be empty &quot; ?
you are pimping me out !
it is clear that the two of you like one another .
sometimes , you need a little nudge .
well , you &apos;re a chaperone !
just disappear !
this dance is not for you !
you &apos;re lucky that &apos;s water .
damn it .
she &apos;s been stewing in there for an hour .
i say let &apos;s lock the door ,
cut the power .
let &apos;s show her that we mean business .
let &apos;s try the joint approach first ... &quot; gitmo . &quot;
okay , we &apos;ve been going over your story ,
and it doesn &apos;t add up .
my purse was too high for joe to reach .
he &apos;s tall enough to reach up here .
he knocked over the baby powder
trying to get my stuffed animals .
not buying it .
look . you can see the footprints where he walked .
walk ?
lily , lily , lily .
joe can &apos;t walk .
he does for me .
so , you have ways of making him walk ?
lily , just admit that you did it .
come here , joe .
come here like you did before .
honey , you &apos;re embarrassing yourself .
come here , joe .
he can &apos;t walk .
he &apos;s walking !
the candles that i lit worked !
look at the stride on him .
he &apos;s as surefooted as a mountain goat .
told you .
i &apos;m so sorry that we doubted you .
boy , did i get lucky .
i &apos;m going to blame everything on him
until he learns how to talk .
this guy waltzes in here like he &apos;s king of the dance
after doing god knows what in sri lanka ,
building schools in underdeveloped areas .
what does that even mean ?
is it possible that you &apos;re being a little hard on the man ?
i turned his two @-@ bit dance into the event of the year .
look . burnouts and dweebs
hanging out together in harmony .
that is me .
i &apos;m sorry , cam .
oh , don &apos;t feel sorry for me .
next is faculty dance .
kaplan can &apos;t move .
it &apos;s on his tumblr .
it &apos;s his big shame .
trust me .
he can &apos;t touch this .
okay , time now for the faculty dance .
go , teachers .
oh , are you sure ?
stop . it &apos;s &quot; cammer &quot; time .
mind if i join you , coach ?
while on sabbatical ,
i learned a thing or two from sri lanka &apos;s own chitrasena .
i don &apos;t know who that is ,
and it &apos;s annoying when you say things
like people are supposed to know !
that pathetic peacock of a man
was not going down without a fight .
i had a choice to make --
be the better dancer or the bigger man .
so , i stepped off the dance floor
and made the obvious call .
you want to win over a crowd ?
invite a lonely mom to dance .
she never saw it coming ,
and neither did he .
hey senor .
you just got out @-@ coached .
i try and look on the bright side of things .
i @-@ i &apos;m a doggy @-@ bath @-@ is @-@ half @-@ full
kind of guy .
but it was time for me to open my eyes .
i was working for a monster .
i came to this job to be the voice of the downtrodden .
turns out those downtrodden were my co @-@ workers ,
and they were desperate for a hero to slay their dragon .
hey , guys . sorry i &apos;m late .
um , rex , how &apos;s it going with mitchell ?
the new guy ?
i haven &apos;t met him yet .
that &apos;s weird . i asked him to introduce himself .
hey , has anybody seen my dog ?
pixie !
oh , there she is .
okay , wendy , i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i have something to say to you ,
something that everybody else here is afraid to say .
now , i know you &apos;re fighting the good fight ,
but that is no excuse for the way you treat people .
t @-@ that actually might be one of the reasons
that you have no personal life
because who wants to come home
to a @-@ a cold , emotionless ... thug ?
w @-@ what are you talking about ?
i am an experienced , respected attorney ,
and on my first day ,
you asked me to bathe rex .
i &apos;m not comfortable with that .
and i &apos;m not comfortable with that ,
but i did it .
okay , that &apos;s pixie .
this is rex ,
the intern i asked you to groom .
and that is my mistake ,
and i own that .
but that is still no excuse
for the way that you tore into him
for the outfit he wore yesterday .
i was talking about the outfit he picked out for me .
apparently , i have the one gay intern in the world
with absolutely no fashion sense .
i was unaware of -- of this dynamic .
but i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m not alone here , all right ?
there are people in this room who feel that you are --
how did we say it ? --
you are a tyrant with no regard for human life .
that sounds like my summation for the slum @-@ lord case .
oh , hey , you finished it ?
it &apos;s wonderful .
but he &apos;s nervous to show you .
why are you so hard on yourself ?
okay , but w @-@ w @-@ what --
what about you making us work on sundays ?
that -- the night of my barbecue ?
dan ?
what are you still doing here ?
it &apos;s your anniversary ! go home !
oh , god . this isn &apos;t happening .
no , no . she &apos;s -- she &apos;s crazy .
i mean , i saw her attack the vending machine .
that &apos;s the only way it works since dennis broke it .
dennis is the guy whose office i took ?
yeah , he was the machine &apos;s best customer
until he started running .
one day , he said he &apos;s got to get out or --
he would die . okay . okay .
wendy , um ...
i @-@ i might owe you a little bit of an apology ,
so i &apos;m sorry .
um , clearly , everybody here loves you ,
and i @-@ i was wrong about everything .
so ... i &apos;m sorry .
you know , you -- you weren &apos;t wrong about everything .
i mean , look , i do joke about it , but you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m alone .
and that is not the first time that someone has called me cold .
okay , those eggs ...
those eggs came out of me frozen .
and i &apos;m impossibly tall .
and even if i could find somebody to love me ,
they -- they wouldn &apos;t be able to reach .
no -- hey , hey . come on .
you &apos;re -- you &apos;re an amazing woman .
she &apos;s an amazing woman .
and you -- you &apos;re a @-@ a role model .
you &apos;re a hero .
i &apos;m a 6 @-@ foot hero .
no . come on .
you &apos;re surrounded by people who love you .
here &apos;s dan and rex .
me . come here .
all the way up to samuel l. jackson there .
that &apos;s your mother in a kangol hat , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
um , are you sure you know what you &apos;re doing , tad ?
i know you &apos;re the mortgage doctor , but --
someone said , &quot; is there a doctor in the house ? &quot;
was i supposed to not get up ?
hey , dad . you need any help out of that dress ?
not unless you want to see me
in nothing but a baby new year &apos;s diaper .
that was the big finish
to the song you were texting through .
hey , i got one text . i saw most of the show --
we &apos;re leaving , okay ?
could you just go to the table
and grab my keys and purse ?
fine .
you want to talk about it ?
how many kinds of fake doctor are you ?
okay , time for the big award of the night ,
the roy ...
i don &apos;t even know why i &apos;m mad at her .
probably just &apos; cause she was so bored all night .
maybe you &apos;re feeling rejected ?
it &apos;s my own fault .
i built up this hope
that she &apos;d want to follow me into real estate .
... phil dunphy .
she &apos;s got her own life now .
i just don &apos;t know where we connect anymore .
you won .
what ? !
yeah .
help me up !
as we all know ,
phil had a little accident tonight ,
but we &apos;re happy to accept
this award on his behalf .
wait , wait , wait .
wait , w @-@ w @-@ w @-@ w @-@ wait !
i got this .
hi . i &apos;m , uh ,
i &apos;m haley , phil &apos;s daughter .
dad , you won the roy !
you all know him as an amazing realtor ,
but i know him as the world &apos;s greatest dad .
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
he &apos;s the dad of the year ,
the &quot; doy . &quot;
it really is a shame
that you didn &apos;t hear the rest of his act tonight .
i @-@ i heard him rehearsing it .
which one of you is j.j. mccubbin ?
oh . hey , quick question , j.j. --
why is a great mortgage rate
like your wife in bed ?
once a month and low interest .
what are you laughing at , skip woosnum ?
you haven &apos;t seen a commission
since you joined the navy .
she is killing it .
that &apos;s my girl .
i would have hit the word &quot; navy &quot; harder .
what else ? what else ?
oh ! margaret furman &apos;s here .
little heads @-@ up to her date --
she &apos;s been upside @-@ down in more houses than fannie mae .
or , in her case , fannie definitely will .
we all want people to think the best of us ...
so sometimes we cover things up
to protect ourselves .
but we don &apos;t have to be afraid ...
because the truth is always a good thing .
the truth sets us free ...
... brings us closer .
so , do you want to tell us
how joe &apos;s shoes ended up on the wrong feet ?
i guess the little guy knows how to put on his own shoes .
there you go , buddy . you got this .
what are you doing ?
since joe can walk now ,
i figured he should be doing a few chores .
steady , big guy !
chores ? what kind of --
there he is .
attaboy !
attaboy !
a beer ? are you crazy ?
where you going ? you want some ?
he &apos;ll bring it to you .
i can &apos;t believe that you &apos;re teaching him to do that .
wait till you see part two .
attaboy .
