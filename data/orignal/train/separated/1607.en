You must be new here?
Yeah, I'm nick.
I'm Mariana Foster,
and I'm running for class president.
"Lexi for prexi"? Really?
Your senior projects, have you guys given any thought
to what you're gonna do?
A rock opera.
Well, Shakespeare's pretty intense.
We have to break up.
I'm so sorry, Talya.
What is that kid doing here?
I invited him.
I'm so happy you're here.
My beautiful granddaughters are getting to know each other.
We don't know that she's having a mastectomy.
She has breast cancer.
She has a pre-cancerous condition.
"Super Callie"? You're such a dork.
I got into this accident.
Those people you almost killed, it was the Fosters.
What about A.J.?
Can we at least wait till after the funeral?
Where are they, Mike?
Look at all the comments you've already gotten.
These mushrooms are all rotten, Will.
They're not all rotten.
You just have to cut around the bad part.
That's what I keep telling you.
Why risk us all getting sick?
Just get rid of 'em.
Nice, mom. And subtle for once.
Well, I'm just saying, you know, mold...
Grows and spreads.
It's kinda like cancer, but that's your decision.
Yes, yes, it is.
They're gonna take the cancer out
with a lumpectomy, Sharon.
Okay, can we not... just not...
What if they miss some and it comes back?
Recurrence in the same breast is fairly low.
Oh, fairly low.
Well, what about the other breast?
Do you want your daughter to have a double mastectomy
when she really doesn't need one?
Okay...
I can't really say that having my only child
have a double mastectomy is at the top of my wish list.
I'm just saying it's better to be safe than sorry.
Get rid of 'em.
Stop. Please.
I...
We're not debating this anymore.
I... I'mma do some tai chi outside.
No, Will. Please stay. Stay, stay, stay, okay?
And... and... and... and speaking of staying,
when are you guys going?
I don't...
You know what? Let me rephrase that.
Please go on your trip, mom, Will, okay?
Have fun. Go.
We are fine. I'm fi... we're gonna be fine.
Really.
Mom... Please, mom.
Mom, please. Mom, come on.
Hey, dad is here.
Oh, hi, Mike.
And goodbye, Brandon.
I know it's all very sudden and unexpected,
but your mother's asked me to leave.
Will, let's... let's pack up the RV.
Mom, really?
Your mushrooms are fine.
Um, the real ones.
They're... they're absolutely perfect to eat.
Good to know.
So what's going on?
Nothing.
Okay.
This a bad time?
No, no, no. We gotta get this done.
So have you told the kids about Ty?
No, I just...
I wanna wait till we find them,
and the longer they're out there, the harder that's gonna be,
so let's get this affidavit filed
and we can get this arrest warrant.
And what about Callie?
What if A.J. reaches out to her?
She promised me that she would let me know if he does.
*This love could be great*
*But they say it would be wrong*
*I don't care*
*'cause I'd be lost without you*
*We live because we love*
*We love 'cause we belong*
*Yes, I swear*
*Oh, you heal the scars*
*I've never felt a wound*
*And we'll never need their rules*
*To guide the way*
*Love will light the day*
Well, that just made our lives a whole lot easier.
We found our Romeo.
Whoa, whoa. I'm not an actor.
No, come on. We're all acting all the time.
Then you do it.
No, I'm composing.
So am I.
Well, I'm also directing.
Y... you have to do it.
Okay? That was amazing.
Really?
Trust me.
Okay.
Okay.
So, now all we need to do is find our Juliet.
What about Talya?
Talya? Uh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Yeah! She's a good actress
and she's got the best voice in drama club.
Yeah, she's my ex.
What's the big deal?
It's not like you're hung up on her or anything.
L... let's just say it didn't end...
all that well, okay?
Okay, so what?
We're seriously gonna hold auditions?
You really want to suffer through every pitchy
American idol wanna be in school who thinks they can sing?
Okay, that's why we should ask Talya.
Mat, even if I didn't think that was a terrible idea,
which I do, there's no way she'd do it, okay?
She hates my guts.
No, no, we're gonna have to find someone else.
I want it to say "I'm confident.
You can trust me with your vote."
So, what do you think?
First one or second one?
Uh, second one.
You're not even looking.
Sexy junior class president or confident junior...
Yeah, the... the sporty... whatever that one...
But that wasn't even an option.
Hey, what the... excuse me!
Whoa, nice rack.
Get out!
Both of you, get out!
And put the toys away!
Ana's coming over with the baby!
Can you believe them?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Can you track the location
of someone who's messaging me on Fost and Found?
Probably.
So who's "Ana with the baby," Huh?
Some chick you knocked up?
No, it's our birth mom.
So all of you are adopted?
Yeah, except Brandon.
One of my moms had him.
And none of you have a dad?
Well, no, we all have dads somewhere,
but me and Mariana don't really know
anything about ours.
I mean, aren't you curious who he is?
I mean, what if he's, like,
I don't know, Pitbull?
I doubt my dad's Pitbull.
Or maybe he's Mario Lopez.
All right, but seriously,
Don't you wanna know who he is?
案犯有 泰龙·克里斯多夫·汉斯代尔 安东尼...
Hold... hold on, why are you naming A.J.?
The warrant's for Ty.
I think we have to.
He's just a runaway, Stef.
He's aiding and abetting a fugitive, Mike, okay?
And that's a crime.
We don't... we don't know if A.J. even knows what Ty did.
He could have just taken off with his brother.
Do you honestly think that they would skip town
24 hours before their grandmother's funeral
if A.J. didn't know?
He knew, Mike... and they took off
Because they knew that we were getting close.
Come on. He's 17, Stef,
and with his prior, they could try him as an adult.
You want A.J. to go to prison?
I feel badly, Mike. I do.
Okay? But he is 17,
and he is old enough to know the consequences of his actions.
All I could track was that the IP address is local.
What do you mean?
Somewhere in San Diego,
But I can't pinpoint exactly where.
Wait, A.J.'s here?
Looks like it.
Are you gonna tell moms?
I think... I think I'm gonna try and get him to come home.
You know Lexi, my former best friend?
She's running against me for class president.
Well, I thought you guys made up after that debacle...
I mean, debate.
Do you even know what "debacle" means?
Uh, yeah.
Okay, maybe that was Nick's joke.
Well, if you're gonna steal jokes,
you should probably steal them
from someone who isn't a total ass.
Just saying.
I thought that Lexi and her family had to move back to Honduras.
They did, but they got their visas, so they're back.
That's nice.
Wait, wasn't Lexi also your ex-girlfriend?
Oh, uh yeah.
Are you guys gonna get back together?
Probably not.
Probably not?
Okay, not.
Good answer.
I have to get this away from me.
Is everyone else done?
Yeah.
Uh, so, I was, um...
I was telling my buddy, Nick, about you,
and he asked me if I knew anything
about my birth father.
Uh, which I don't really...
and I was wondering
if there was anything you could tell me.
Um, like what?
Uh, like...
What's his name?
What was he like?
Uh, his name was Gabriel.
I don't really know much about him.
We met at a party.
It... it was a one-time thing.
I don't even know where he is
or whatever happened to him.
Sorry.
It's okay.
You don't have to be sorry.
It's not a big deal.
Grandma's leaving!
I just want to...
thank most of you for being so gracious
and welcoming.
My family.
My treasures.
My treasures.
My only living relatives.
The only people in the world who actually matter to me.
Well, you matter to me, Will.
Stefanie?
Yeah?
I don't know when we'll see each other again.
Do you have to be so melodramatic, mother?
Just stating facts.
Safe trip!
See you later.
Oh, my...
He ran away? Why?
I guess to be with his brother.
I know you really cared about him. I'm sorry.
Well, at least now I can go back
to creating my online dating profile.
Why don't you date Ana?
You guys would be so cute together.
Yeah, we're just...
We're just friends.
I think someone needs changing.
I'll change her.
So you two "friends" can talk.
So...
Listen, there's a little more to this A.J. story.
Stef and I think that his brother, Ty,
was the driver who hit you and the twins.
Sorry, I was just gonna go say bye to grandma.
Hey, mom, what'd you do to the RV?
As difficult as it is to believe, Stefanie,
I didn't do anything.
Do you think I would really do something
and keep myself someplace where I'm so unwelcome?
You're always welcome here, mom,
But your opinions, however...
I'll just keep my opinions to myself and we'll...
push the old RV out of your driveway
and into the streets someplace.
Actually, we're gonna have to borrow their electricity,
if you ladies don't mind.
Of course we don't mind.
I'll pay for the utility bill this month.
Not necessary, mother.
Oh, I insist.
Of course you do.
By the way, um...
A.J. agreed to meet me tomorrow after school.
Fingers crossed.
Who else knows?
About Ty? Nobody.
Let's keep it that way.
Your mom doesn't want the other kids to know until we find them.
I'm sorry, dad.
Maybe you were right about A.J.
I guess I should've never trusted him.
I mean, I... I don't know, dad.
He was...
in a tough position. Ty is his family.
He made a mistake.
Committed a crime, Brandon.
Well, yeah, but I committed a crime.
When I made those fake IDs. Remember?
And the only reason why I didn't get arrested
is because my parents are cops.
Look...
I have made some bad choices.
You never gave up on me, dad.
You don't give up on family.
I don't know.
All I'm saying is maybe cut him some slack.
Hey, I'm heading out.
Okay. See ya.
What's up?
Well, I'm not sure if I should even be saying anything...
About what?
About your dad.
Your birth dad.
What about him?
Well you know how my dad's a contractor, right?
Right.
Anyway, I heard him talking to my mom the other day,
and he was saying how he just hired Gabriel on one of his jobs.
Does Ana know?
I don't think so,
but from what I heard, it doesn't sound like
your dad was just some random guy.
I think he was her boyfriend.
I can find out where he's working
if you wanna know.
Vote Mariana for junior class president
You want a button?
Talya.
So, Mat told me what you're doing
for your senior project, and I'd love to be your Juliet.
I mean, not your Juliet,
but I mean...
Right. Yeah, no, that... that'd be... that'd be great.
Here's the thing, we're actually having,
open auditions.
My mom's vice principal, as you know,
So, she's kinda making us, so...
But you should totally come to audition,
You know, if you want to.
No problem.
Prepare to be blown away.
Hey, Callie.
How have you been?
Good. Yeah.
Good.
Yeah.
You know, a bunch of the kids
at the center are talking about "Fost and found."
Such a great idea.
Hey, congratulations! You got adopted!
I'm so glad things are going so well, Callie.
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.
You know I was actually gonna reach out to you,
see about doing an event, a fost and found event
at the drop-in center, if you're interested.
You know that sounds great, but I actually have to go
because I have to meet someone, but...
Let's talk soon, yeah? For sure.
Okay.
Yeah cool, we'll talk later.
Bye.
Open auditions?
We said we weren't gonna do that.
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know. Okay.
I may have panicked a little bit
when Talya said she wanted to be my Juliet.
But that's good, right?
That means she doesn't hate you after all.
Oh, no, no, I'm pretty sure she still hates me.
But you know Talya.
She's ambitious and she loves drama.
Okay, okay, I get it. It's awkward.
But do you wanna do all this work
and then cast a Juliet who can't sing?
We have to be professional here.
Well, now we have to have the auditions
or else she's gonna know I lied to her.
Fine.
But when Talya auditions and she is the best Juliet,
you're just gonna have to suck it up, deal?
Okay, deal.
Now look me in the eyes when you say that.
Deal.
Thank you.
My eyes hurt.
Do you wanna maybe do something else?
No, it's okay. I wanna keep playing.
You can do whatever you want.
Do you want a snack?
I'm gonna go in the kitchen.
Where's Jude?
Don't know.
So is Jack, like, your new best friend now?
He's friends with our xbox,
But that's about it.
How's Connor?
Who knows?
Are you guys still...
Yeah, we're... still.
When's he gonna come see you then?
I don't know.
He's all into his new school and now he's doing football,
So he's practically got games every weekend.
Yeah, but LA's only a few hours away.
Might as well be another planet.
So what else did she say?
Nothing.
Just that his name's Gabriel and he was some random dude.
That's it?
Yeah, and then my cousin said that
he was more like her boyfriend or something.
Dude...
One of those guys could be him.
You ever see his picture?
No.
I told you, I have no idea what he looks like.
Hey, what about him?
Which one?
That guy with the nail gun. Right there.
He looks just like you.
That's gotta be your dad.
Dude, go talk to him.
I can't just go up to him
and be like, "Hey, I'm your son."
Why not?
Because!
What if I yell out his name?
See if he even turns around...
No, don't!
Then what are we even doing here?
Look, I don't know, man, okay?
All right, let's just... let's just go.
Come on! Drive! I mean it! Let's go!
Jesus!
Hey, toss me that socket wrench, would ya?
Uh... Which one?
The long one.
That's it.
Muchas gracias.
That's cool you know how to fix cars.
Well, my dad was a mechanic, so...
My dad works in construction...
I think.
You think?
He's my birth dad. I don't actually know.
Well, do you want to?
I don't know.
I happen to believe
that man's connection to his father shapes his life,
and he has to choose how that relationship or...
You know, lack of one is gonna define him.
So...
Do you think I should get to know him?
Doesn't matter what I think.
Matters if you think you have to know who your dad is...
to know who you are.
Where's your friend?
I guess he went home.
He didn't say goodbye.
Oh, that's odd.
He's odd.
I think I found him.
Hey, what the hell are you doing in my moms' bed?
Jude!
What is going on?
I... I just came up to use the bathroom.
But so you decided to climb in their bed?
Who does that?
I'm sorry. I'm just... I was...
I was tired and it looked really comfortable.
What are you? Goldilocks?
Jude, stop it!
I'm... I'm gonna go.
Wha... good. And don't come back.
Can I give you a ride home?
No, thanks.
Look, I know you're upset about Connor,
but don't take it out on him.
He's just so weird.
A lot of people used to think that we were weird too.
Remember that?
So?
He didn't show.
Rafael came in...
You know, the guy from the drop-in center...
And...
I'm thinking maybe A.J. saw me with him
and then ran or maybe he just blew me off.
I don't know.
Answer it.
Hi, Callie.
A.J.?
Are... are you okay?
I'm all right.
I... I just wanted to call and tell you I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I left without saying goodbye.
You doing okay?
Yeah, I'm just worried about you.
Is... is Mike really pissed at me?
No, he's just sad, I think.
He misses you. We all do.
Where are you staying?
You're not on the streets, are you?
No, no.
We're crashing with some dudes that Ty knew, but...
It's kinda sketchy.
Please come home, A.J.
I can't.
I can't do that to Ty.
Look, I gotta go.
They don't know that I'm using their phone
for a long-distance call.
Wait, long distance?
Aren't you in San Diego?
No.
No, but the Email address you've been using
on Fost and Found is from here.
I haven't been on Fost and Found.
But we've been IMing.
No, I don't know
who you've been talking to, but it's not me.
Look, Callie, I gotta go. Take care.
What did he say?
That wasn't A.J. on Fost and Found.
You got catfished?
I guess.
Where is he? Did he say?
No.
What are you gonna do?
It's an Arizona area code
And I think it's a landline.
He sounds like he really wants to come home.
I'm just afraid that if he stays with his brother,
he's gonna get in some real trouble.
Well, you did the right thing, Callie. You really did.
Okay?
So what next?
Well, hopefully we'll trace this back to an address
and, um... And then we go get him.
I'm leaving tonight
to assist the Phoenix PD with the arrest.
Stef, please. Let me go in first,
talk to A.J. into coming back on his own,
before the arrest.
He doesn't deserve to go to prison
for just standing by his brother.
I'm not risking Ty running again.
I made that mistake last time.
Come on! What about Brandon?
How many times has he messed up and we let him off the hook?
Do not equate Brandon's mistakes
with A.J. protecting the driver that almost killed my children!
Honey, maybe Mike has a point.
Think about what this could do to A.J.'s future.
Lena, you know that
I always take your opinion seriously.
I do, especially lately,
But this is not open for a discussion.
Mike, you don't have to be a part of this.
It won't fall on you.
I can take care of this.
Mariana, Jude, get down here. You'll be late.
So you're having auditions for R & J?
Yeah, but Mat's playing Romeo,
so don't even think about it.
Don't worry, I don't want to be in your stupid musical.
I'm not gonna have time when I'm class president.
Cocky.
Not cocky, confident.
And why shouldn't she be?
Thank you, mama.
Do you know what time you'll have the results?
Well, everyone votes at lunch, and we should have
the results tallied by the end of today.
Hey, where's mom?
She went to go get A.J.
He called me. He's in Arizona.
With his brother?
Yeah, I think so.
♪Just one more step♪
♪Just one more breath♪
♪For you, I will♪
♪I will be brave♪
That was awesome, Talya.
Thank you.
Yeah, it was... it was... it was great.
We'll let you know really soon.
Okay.
Well, it looks like we found our Juliet.
Come on, dude.
Sometimes you just gotta suck it up
and do the right thing.
Uh, what... what are you doing here?
I'm auditioning.
It's open auditions, right?
Right,
But aren't you gonna be, like, too busy
with junior class president and all that?
I lost.
The results haven't been announced yet, but...
Mama gave me a heads-up.
Lexi won.
So, now that I have plenty of time,
I'd really like a chance...
Just a shot at being in your show.
Okay.
Yeah. Let's... let's start with the chorus.
Okay.
♪I will be brave♪
♪I will be strong♪
♪Nothing can tear us apart♪
♪Just one more step♪
♪Just one more breath♪
♪For you, I will♪
♪I will be brave♪
Uh, that... that was really good.
So we will, uh...
We will...
We'll get back to you.
No.
No way.
Come on, dude.
Sometimes you just gotta suck it up
and do the right thing.
Hey, Mariana, wait!
Look...
If you don't want me to be in your musical...
That's okay.
You can say it.
I don't want you in my musical.
Okay.
I don't want you in my musical, but...
You were hands down the best Juliet.
So... Would you...
...be in my musical?
Look, I...
I wanted to apologize for what I said.
It's okay if you don't want to hang out with me anymore.
That's not it.
It feels like you don't want to hang out with me.
I mean, whenever you come over,
all you want to do is play video games.
That's not true.
I really like you.
I'm sorry. I've...
never really had friends before.
And I like being here.
You're so lucky. I wish...
I wish I could have a family like this.
It'll happen.
No, it won't.
Not for me.
I know I'm weird.
That's why no one's ever adopted me
and why they never will.
Look, I used to think the same thing,
but look at me now.
Just don't give up.
Come on. Let's go play Clash of Clans.
Can we play the racing game?
Ready?
Yeah.
Listen, um...
Does A.J. know that Mom's coming to get him?
No.
I can tell he wants to come home.
He just doesn't have the heart to leave his brother, you know?
So you... you made the decision for him.
Um, except th-there's something you don't know.
Mom and my dad think that Ty
was the one driving the car that hit Ana and the twins...
which means...
A.J. is helping a criminal.
So, if they find him with Ty...
he could get in a lot more trouble
than for just running away.
Um, I'll be right back.
Yeah.
Hello?
A.J.? It's Callie.
Ty, is that you?
What'd you tell Callie?
Nothing, I swear.
Get your stuff. We're leaving. Now!
Come on! Move!
I'm not goin'.
What?
I can't. I can't run anymore.
I'm sorry, Ty.
You go.
It's okay.
Police! Open up!
Tyrone Hensdale?
That's me.
We have a warrant for your arrest.
Both hands on your head, please, and turn around.
Sir, hands behind your back.
A.J., we're arresting your brother
because he was involved in the hit and run
that injured Mariana and Jesus.
Now, I know you knew nothing about that,
but we're gonna have to take you
in for running away, all right?
Let's go.
Connect these nails here and here...
When you get done with that nail, that sure will...
Thanks, man.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hey, are you Gabriel?
No. That's Gabriel over there.
Who wants to know?
Uh, somebody told me to
talk to him about getting a job here.
How old are you?
18.
Okay.
We could use the help today.
It pays 10 bucks an hour in cash, under the table.
Go help Gabriel.
Uh, that guy said I was supposed to help you.
All right. Grab the other side.
Why didn't you tell me
that Ty was the driver from the accident?
I couldn't, Callie.
So is A.J. gonna be charged with, like, a crime now?
I don't think so. No.
So what's gonna happen?
They're gonna bring him back to San Diego and he's...
And he'll go to juvie.
I should have never said anything.
I think that he'll see
you're just trying to be a good friend, Cal.
I warned A.J. to, uh, to play dumb about Ty,
so I think that if he keeps quiet,
he'll be fine.
I'm, uh, sorry for snapping before I left.
What did you mean when you said you'd been taking my,
my opinions to heart lately?
Does this have to do with the mastectomy?
Because I thought you agreed
you weren't going to do something so radical
if you didn't have to.
Look.
Does this mean...
It probably means...
it's not a question of if I get cancer...
It's a question of when.
Having the BRCA 1 gene increases my chances
of getting breast cancer, invasive breast cancer,
at some point.
So, since I have DCIS,
I think
I don't want to take any chances.
I think I do want to get a double mastectomy.
My baby...
What can I do?
Stay.
I think I'm gonna need you.
I'll be right here.
I'm not going anywhere.
Thanks, Mom.
Uh, listen, I...
I think as soon as the RV is fixed...
I think you should go on the trip.
I'll stay here.
Stef needs me.
Yeah. Okay.
I'll head out first thing in the morning.
It's fixed?
It was never broken.
Listen, I didn't want you to leave your daughter
in the middle of a fight, you know?
Oh, you!
What do you see in me?
A woman 10 years older than you...
I see a beautiful woman
with a spirit 10 years younger than me.
Are you saying I'm immature?
I'm saying this isn't a fling.
At least not for me.
And I'll go on my trip...
but I'll be back to get you.
Whenever you're ready.
Done?
Uh, yeah. Thanks.
You wanna play another game?
