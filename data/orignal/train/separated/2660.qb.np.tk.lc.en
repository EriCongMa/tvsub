this is on you , raymond .
you were wrong to make her believe
you could keep her safe .
she left behind a little girl . she &apos;ll need protection .
only if you &apos;re in her life .
i won &apos;t let you make the same mistake with her
that you made with liz .
who attacked us at the church ?
i don &apos;t know .
whoever employed solomon &apos;s services ,
they know too much .
they &apos;re breathing down our necks even now ,
listening , watching .
we need to put down the threat quickly .
oh , i know . i know
i wish there was something i could say
to stop your tears ...
... to take away the pain of losing her ,
but i can &apos;t .
what i can do is remind you of how lucky we were
to have had elizabeth in our lives .
i need to see some id .
what does the lord ask of us ?
to do justice , love mercy ,
and walk humbly with our god .
reddington &apos;s guys ?
yeah . not that i asked them to be here .
they &apos;re here for her protection .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t want reddington or his goons
to be any part of her life .
i know .
please tell me you know how to swaddle a baby .
i hear bourbon works .
did elizabeth do justice ?
she came into our lives under extraordinary circumstances
that few agents could hold up under .
but she did more than hold up .
she thrived .
you look nice .
she withstood scrutiny from her peers ,
false accusations from her government ,
and helped take down some of the worst criminals
this country has ever known .
agent ressler , it &apos;s time .
code red ! code red ! all units , please respond .
we &apos;re under heavy fire .
bearcat , don &apos;t dismount there . shut it down .
wait , who the hell are these guys ?
we can &apos;t be late .
we gotta find them .
yeah , and we will , just not now . we have to go .
did she love mercy ?
i &apos;ve never met anyone more forgiving .
elizabeth followed her heart ,
and against all odds , it led her back to the man she loved .
did she walk humbly with her god ?
i &apos;ll never forget the day i met her .
it was her first day on the job .
she had been offered an opportunity
that most agents wait a lifetime to get .
&quot; why me ? &quot; she asked .
&quot; i &apos;m nobody special . &quot;
i think we all know different .
she was humble , self @-@ effacing ,
and very , very special .
like all of you , i &apos;m sad and angry .
like you also ,
i &apos;m also very blessed
to have known elizabeth .
so as we leave here today ,
let &apos;s celebrate .
the last few days , many have come up to me
and they &apos;ve said , &quot; we are so sorry for your loss . &quot;
but we haven &apos;t lost elizabeth .
we know exactly where she is .

♬ i wish that i knew what i know now ♬
i can &apos;t believe reddington didn &apos;t come .
i can . he knows this is his fault .
hey , aram , that download -- how far along are you ...
don &apos;t judge . i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m just super stressed out .
oh , you &apos;re kidding me , right ?
it &apos;s legal in d.c.
i feel horrible .
well , you should . it &apos;s a funeral .
i feel so badly for tom .
i keep thinking maybe there &apos;s something
we should do for him .
we ?
lead us not into temptation ,
but deliver us from evil ,
for thine is the kingdom , the power ,
and the glory forever .
amen .
amen .
wait . i need to -- i need to say something .
&quot; when she shall die ...
&quot; take her ...
&quot; and cut her out in little stars ,
&quot; and she will make the face of heaven so fine
&quot; that all the world will be in love with night
and pay no worship to the garish sun . &quot;
&quot; romeo and juliet . &quot;
agent keen loved shakespeare .
and dr. seuss .
she loved dim sum and -- and beyoncé ,
and those little wooden , uh , foot massagers
that go under your desk .
i know the things she loved
because we were friends .
even though i called her &quot; agent keen , &quot;
that was out of the respect i had for her .
her friends also called her liz .
i miss you , liz . just --
okay . thank you .
what are you doing here ?
your granddaughter .
she &apos;s ...
i &apos;m sorry .

we are not standing down .
and don &apos;t give me protocol
about investigating the death of a colleague .
then how about you &apos;re too close , too emotional , and too raw
to come within a country mile of doing a good job finding
who attacked agent keen &apos;s wedding ?
we have to do something .
yes , you do . find reddington .
he &apos;ll turn up . he always does .
no , he always did because of keen .
now his cooperation was predicated on her .
now that she &apos;s gone , does he intend to continue ?
i don &apos;t have a clue .
well , then you need to get one .
we made a deal with the most wanted man in america .
it &apos;d be nice to know if he &apos;s planning to honor it .
and keen ?
you worry about reddington .
we &apos;ve assigned top agents to her case .
who ?
top ... agents .
come on , they really expect us to stand down ?
yeah , that &apos;s not happening . where are we ?
all right , whoever was after agent keen
hacked into a telecom hub .
the servers in that basement were sifting data
intercepted from the fiber optic cables .
sifting it and sending it where ?
i don &apos;t know .
once they realized we &apos;d figured out what they were doing ,
they pulled the plug and -- and severed all communications .
but we know what they were looking for -- keen .
they were watching her .
right . yes .
watching and listening through
private security cameras ...
traffic cams .
someone was watching the attack on the church , in real time .
she never stood a chance .
they were following her the whole time .
and you have no idea where this information was being sent ?
who was tracking her ?
i &apos;m tracing the packet routes , but it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s gonna take time .
what i do know is that , uh , agent keen
wasn &apos;t the only person they were monitoring .
uh , they were intercepting cell and cctv footage
out of the warwick hotel in midtown ,
along with voice and internet traffic
out of something called the , uh , global financial council .
how is that connected to keen ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s ...
there &apos;s so many pieces to sort through . it &apos;s ...
this is the sort of thing mr. reddington would just see
without even blinking .
thank you .
as soon as the name &quot; masha rostova &quot;
hit the 24 @-@ hour news cycle , they came for her .
i thought i could ... protect her .
i did protect her , all these years .
i &apos;ve anticipated almost every threat .
but this one ...
a medical complication in childbirth .
masha had a child ?
a girl .
she was born prematurely , but she &apos;s expected to be fine .
well , that &apos;s wonderful .
now i am a great @-@ grandfather .
i came here to tell you that .
sure . i &apos;m sure you did .
right there on your desk calendar .
okay , so we ...
tuck , then we fold from the bottom .
just tuck , fold ....
crap . i don &apos;t know .
you know , i know what you &apos;re thinking .
you &apos;re thinking , &quot; dad , you suck at this . &quot;
but i &apos;m telling you ...
i can do this .
i think .
okay , i &apos;ve got something .
all right , one of the cellphones being tapped belongs
to an executive assistant named amanda bigelow ,
the other to an anthony mayhew ,
a chauffeur .
both work for an executive who &apos;s staying
at our third point of reference ,
the warwick hotel ,
while in new york to speak at a conference
held by reference point number four ,
the global financial council .
so the common denominator is the executive .
benjamin stalder .
president of the energy consortium group .
if the same people who monitored liz are monitoring him ,
he could be the key to finding liz &apos;s killers .
or he could be their next target .
what the hell are you doing ?
what ?
you &apos;re clearing her out
like she &apos;s been evicted from a monthly rental .
have some respect .
standard procedure is
to secure the effects of a terminated party --
get out . now .
hey ! you two , out now .
donald .
you believe this ?
they &apos;re just doing their job .
why don &apos;t you take a break ?
i &apos;m gonna collect agent keen &apos;s effects myself .
vultures .
i &apos;d imagine it to be a challenge ,
playing rachmaninoff &apos;s c @-@ sharp minor &quot; prelude &quot;
without the benefit of c @-@ sharp .
it would be ...
if i played anymore .
why are you still here ?
i &apos;m not entirely sure i know .
sympathy ?
excuse me ?
are you waiting for my sympathy ?
maybe a hug .
god , no .
good , because you wouldn &apos;t find that here anyway .
i just needed to be someplace ...
quiet .
well , i wasn &apos;t expecting you .
i have to go to town for groceries .
i &apos;m sorry for the intrusion .
let me give you some money , please .
could you pick up a single malt ?
preferably from the highlands , but not islay .
the water there tastes like seaweed and iodine .
♬ traveling through the graveyard ♬
♬ with a suitcase full of sparks ♬
♬ honey , i &apos;m just trying to find my way to you ♬
♬ lit up every campfire ♬
♬ i found out in the dark ♬
♬ all the countless days along the sea of blue ♬
♬ learned the language of the mockingbird ♬
♬ she took and twisted all my words ♬
♬ yeah , i &apos;m just trying to find my way to you ♬
♬ and i &apos;ll meet you in the graveyard ♬
♬ with the winter trees and stars ♬
what can you tell me
about the mother &apos;s family medical history ?
♬ open up this suitcase full of sparks ♬
nothing .
and neither could she . they died when she was young .
what about elizabeth herself ?
any cancer , heart disease , diabetes ?
no . look ...
doctor , is something wrong with my baby ?
agnes is just fine .
but the more genetic blanks i can fill in the charts ,
you know , the better i know what to screen for .
what about your family ?
more blanks .
i never knew my parents either .
i think that &apos;s what made liz and i work .
you know , it was the first time either of us felt like ...
... family .
excuse me .
cooper .
it &apos;s tom keen .
tom , i &apos;m glad you called .
i just collected a box of personal things from liz &apos;s office .
all right . i &apos;ll come pick &apos; em up now .
look , maybe i could ...
... work on the case
while i &apos;m there , because i &apos;m ... i &apos;m useless here .
we have things under control .
no . see , that &apos;s the problem , all right ?
the situation doesn &apos;t call for control .
the only way we &apos;re gonna find the bastards who came after liz
is if we sink to their level .
tom , stop . just be with your child .
we have a solid lead , and we &apos;re working it now .
i don &apos;t care how well the stock was doing before .
it &apos;s imploding now .
it &apos;s a classic pump and dump .
we need to liquidate immediately .
no -- wait , hang on . front desk is calling .
i think my driver &apos;s here .
i gotta head over to the conference .
dump that stock , lawrence !
stalder &apos;s not answering . keep trying the room .
we &apos;re almost there ,
but i need hotel security to find him and secure him .
agent navabi , i have eyes on mr. stalder
approaching the elevator .
he &apos;s got two of his own men with him ,
and i see his driver down here in the lobby .
he &apos;s good .
rolling thunder , this is operator 4 @-@ 6 .
unicorn is at the elevators .
roger that . we are 15 seconds from location .
asset is on site , ready for extraction .
agent navabi . where &apos;s stalder ?
elevator 2 , landing any second .
come on . come on .
gone .
what floor did it stop on ?
7 .
and where do those stairs lead ?
west alley service entrance , end of that corridor .
all right , let me take the alley .
okay .
fbi ! freeze ! on the ground ! on the gro--
abort ! we got fbi ! go ! go ! go !
you have no right to go through her things .
and that &apos;s my coat !
i was just imagining
young katarina covered in glitter .
as an adult , it &apos;s easy to dismiss this stuff
as girlish frivolity .
you forget the wonder it creates ,
the light captured , secret wishes evoked .
it renders even the darkest days sparkly .
never underestimate the power of glitter .
stop it .
stop what ?
stop ... torturing me .
that was never my intention .
then what are you doing out here ?
these boxes are all i have ...
all i have left of my daughter .
i &apos;m sorry , dom . i understand .
no , you don &apos;t . you don &apos;t understand .
you think because masha &apos;s dead ,
now you -- you can understand me ?
you can -- you can share my misery ?
i feel bereft , just like you .
no , not just like me .
she &apos;s gone because of choices you made for both of them .
first katarina and then masha .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , you killed my entire family !
no , you &apos;re not like me .
nez rowan ? you &apos;re sure it was her ?
i had a pretty good angle on her face
as she cracked me with the butt of her weapon . it &apos;s her .
how is that even possible ? we had her dead to rights
for the armed robbery of a nuclear facility ,
conspiracy to kidnap , accessory to murder .
i personally signed the paperwork
for her transfer to fort meade to await trial .
so why isn &apos;t she rotting in a cell ?
i &apos;ll have aram look into it .
aram is taking a personal day today .
he &apos;s not dealing with liz &apos;s death very well .
he &apos;s not alone .
i &apos;ll look into the rowan situation myself .
look , she &apos;s definitely working with the same team of mercs
who tried to abduct keen .
rowan &apos;s extraction team outside the hotel today --
they wore the exact same equipment as they did .
okay , well , let &apos;s find out from mr. stalder
why they &apos;re after him and how he connects to liz .
i run the energy consortium group .
we advise governments and private sector clients
on energy and economic business models .
i recommend who gets billion @-@ dollar contracts
and who doesn &apos;t . so --
that &apos;s why you travel with such a heavy security contingent .
yeah . that &apos;s right .
i &apos;ve received plenty of death threats over the years .
we &apos;ll need any record you have of those ,
along with a complete client list .
of course .
did anything unusual happen today ,
before the abduction ?
no . i never left the suite .
i was working on my speech for the global financial council .
can you think of any reason
why someone would want to stop that speech ?
no . it was just a general state of the industry address .
mr. stalder ,
do you have any connection with elizabeth keen ?
the fugitive . right ?
uh , no , only what i hear in the news .
whatever happened to her , anyway ?
that &apos;s not where the capers go .
dom ...
move .
you still have family .
who ? the baby ?
i won &apos;t live long enough to see her out of nappies .
if i &apos;m allowed to see her at all .
i had to make do with photographs of masha .
did you even tell her about me ?
i couldn &apos;t .
you know how complicated it was .
there was nothing complicated about it .
we had to back out of masha &apos;s life to keep her safe ,
after you made a colossal mess of everything .
only you couldn &apos;t stay well enough away , could you ?
now you -- you come to my house with this sorry tale of loss ,
like you &apos;re the only one affected by this .
you &apos;re the only one whose feelings matter .
well , guess what , raymond ?
masha was my granddaughter , and now she &apos;s dead
without even knowing i existed !
all my sacrifices shot to hell .
i could &apos;ve spent the last 30 years
just being her grandfather ...
you selfish prick .
she had your temper .
i loved that girl enough to let her go ,
which is more than you can say .
did my office send you what you wanted ?
yes . we have your client list . we &apos;re running them down now .
but we need to go over your abduction one more time .
we &apos;ve been over it six times .
i can &apos;t stay here . i have to fly to dubai tonight .
listen , mr. stalder , leaving now would be a huge mistake .
you &apos;re in immediate danger .
my firm contracts with the best security teams
that money can buy .
now that we &apos;re aware of the threat ,
i am confident in their ability to keep me safe .
now i &apos;m sorry , but i have to go .
do you know who had nez rowan released from military custody
three days ago ?
oh , honey , you &apos;ve come to a goat &apos;s house looking for wool .
i warned you , harold . stand down .
you know who did it .
have you found raymond reddington ?
damn it , cynthia .
nez rowan was part of a shadow army
that left directly to the death of agent keen .
rowan was the best lead we have . who let her go free ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s over my head .
what i can tell you
is that there are certain u.s. government missions .
covert . dangerous . necessary .
and they require the expertise of an independent organization .
don &apos;t patronize me .
those people got one of my best agents killed ,
and you expect me to walk away .
how can i justify that ?
i know full well you look the other way when you need to ,
because working with an international criminal
enables you to bring good to the world .
i can &apos;t look the other way .
not this time .
they took someone that i love .
best thing you can do for all of us
is locate reddington
and find a way to keep him on your team .
hold on .
hold on .
yeah .
you ready to roll in the mud ?
thought you &apos;d never ask .
surprise .
dembe ...
please don &apos;t be mad at him .
dembe understood how important this is ,
and you weren &apos;t answering his calls ,
or i @-@ i never would have dropped by unannounced .
it &apos;s rude , and ... i hate to be rude .
what do you want , aram ?
you need to come back with me .
why ?
we &apos;re not getting anywhere .
in the investigation of ... agent keen &apos;s death .
we could use your help .
harold cooper is a very capable leader .
he &apos;ll sort it out .
it &apos;s more than that .
i can &apos;t work . the post office ,
without agent keen ...
without you ...
it &apos;s just a government building .
i &apos;m sorry you came all the way out here for nothing , aram .
i can &apos;t help you .
you gave me a speech over an empty grave ,
about the foundational elements in our lives .
&quot; people who form the brick and mortar
of who we are . &quot;
how , when they &apos;re suddenly not there , we ...
we collapse into rubble .
now it was after agent keen was almost killed by the cabal .
but i saved her .
you looked into that empty grave back then and said
you &apos;d be staring at her if it weren &apos;t for me .
now i understand why you have collapsed into rubble .
i do ,
and i &apos;m truly sorry .
but i &apos;m here to collect on your debt .
you owe me .
so let &apos;s go .
to pay ...
m @-@ my debt to you
would require more than i possess .
i &apos;m not coming back .
if reddington &apos;s not coming back for keen ,
he &apos;s not coming back , period .
okay , so what &apos;s our next move ?
aram , did you have any luck with those servers from the basement ?
i thought i &apos;d be able to figure out
where they routed their data ,
but i couldn &apos;t find the end of the proxy chain .
well , they have to be bouncing it off
some kind of hidden servers around the earth .
or hidden servers ... over the earth .
i checked all the viable telecom satellites in geo and leo orbit ,
but i didn &apos;t check the offline ones .
offline satellites ?
yeah , there are thousands
of unused and decommissioned satellites
circling our heads -- space junk .
it &apos;s not enough that we litter the planet .
okay , the challenge is to figure out which ones they used .
agent mojtabai .
agent mojtabai ...
welcome back .
don &apos;t you dare !
how do you drink this stuff ?
we drank it with every meal on the farm when i was a boy .
but we had cows , and we made our own .
in the summers , we made buttermilk pops in the freezer .
kept us all from passing out .
so buttermilk reminds you of home .
i overheard your conversation with the arab boy .
he &apos;s from delaware .
you won &apos;t be troubled again with unexpected visitors .
i know how you value your privacy .
why didn &apos;t you go with him ?
what would be the point ?
there &apos;s nothing i could do that would really matter .
cry me a river . hmm ?
what the hell are you really doing here ?
you -- you gave me the news about masha .
what do you want from me ?
a way forward .
i can &apos;t live for long with what i feel inside .
i don &apos;t see how anyone can .
you said it , chum .
look around here . you call this living ?
after i lost my daughter ...
i crawled ...
crawled into the wilderness
like a mortally wounded animal
to get as far away from the pack as i could ,
to -- to run out the clock .
run out the clock and die . and ...
if you came for a survival manual ,
you won &apos;t find it here .
but you -- you &apos;ve got one thing i haven &apos;t had for a long time .
you &apos;ve got a reason -- a reason to walk out that door .
it sounds to me like there are honest people out there
who are depending upon you to ...
god help them .
god help them .
dom , you &apos;ve always had a good reason to walk out the door .
okay , i think i &apos;m getting somewhere .
so you found the needle in the haystack ?
i &apos;m not looking for a needle . we need the whole haystack .
and if i &apos;m right ,
it &apos;s the artax network .
what is that ?
it &apos;s an old telecom project to provide data coverage
to every corner of the earth
through a network of 73 satellites .
anyway , the company went bankrupt
and the project was abandoned .
but the 73 satellites are still out there .
you think our target is using them ?
is there any way to confirm that the network &apos;s still active ?
well , i &apos;ve just gained access to a relay station ,
and i am about to lock onto one of the satellites .
if it &apos;s in use , the data will be encrypted ,
but ... we &apos;ll know if it &apos;s active .
okay .
here we go .
they have control of the artax satellite network .
and they used it to kill liz .
all right . can we use it to find them ?
okay , so i was able to get a location by examining
the latency patterns in the satellite signal .
they &apos;re being fed to 2054 pulaski avenue .
concrete panels with granite faces .
we &apos;ve got no line @-@ of @-@ sight inside .
only one point of entry .
then only one point of egress .
lock it up tight after we breach .
hq , this is operator 4 @-@ 6 .
we have poachers at the eagle &apos;s nest .
initiating the protocol .
they &apos;re in .
other than nez , we can &apos;t put faces to any of the mercs .
so i scrubbed through the warwick &apos;s security footage
to try and find some .
good job . what &apos;d you get us ?
nothing . um , at least no mercs .
but i did find this ...
a shot of our victim .
one hour before his abduction .
stalder told ressler and navabi he never left his suite .
was he lying or did he just forget ?
well , that doesn &apos;t look like a woman --
or a conversation -- he &apos;d have forgotten .
who is she ?
i don &apos;t know . and we can &apos;t ask stalder .
i checked . he just cleared u.s. airspace .
they &apos;re onto the 11th floor . go .
15 seconds and counting .
all right , do a full vertical sweep .
they &apos;re somewhere in this building .
so much for evidence .
raymond ?
raymond !
thank you for having dinner with me .
it was nice .
you &apos;re welcome to come inside .
no .
not tonight , but maybe we can have dinner again .
tomorrow ?
yeah .
huh ? yeah , i know .
wait . shh .
it &apos;s okay . shh .
what did you say ?
oh , come here .
i did it . i did it , huh ?
i got you . i got you .
we did it .
yeah , we did .
tell me you found something useful .
depends . i followed panabaker to the airport ,
where she had a meeting on the tarmac with this woman .
that &apos;s the woman that stalder met at the hotel
just an hour before his attempted abduction .
who &apos;s stalder ?
benjamin stalder .
a high @-@ powered executive at an energy consortium .
whoever was tracking liz was also going after him .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . we let him go ,
but i &apos;m getting the distinct feeling that was a mistake .
stalder &apos;s obviously more involved than he was letting on .
so who is this woman ?
we don &apos;t know yet .
the hotel photo wasn &apos;t much to go on ,
but with these new images ,
aram should be able to locate her in one of our databases .
liz was convinced that her mother was
the one who tried to kidnap her .
reddington said she died years ago ,
but liz didn &apos;t believe that , and neither do i.
i think we &apos;re staring at katarina rostova .
mr. reddington .
i &apos;m here to pay my debt to you , aram .
you &apos;re back .
strap on your bike and helmet , we &apos;re going to work .
