come on . watch out .
it &apos;s like everyone forgot about christopher columbus .
i &apos;m pretty sure that was last month .
no , thanksgiving .
you can &apos;t put up a christmas tree before you eat stuffing .
like you eat stuffing .
all i &apos;m saying is that it &apos;s a little early for rudolph , that &apos;s all .
speaking of noses of a different color ,
why was jonathan kissing your ass this morning ?
i &apos;m so over him .
just so long as you &apos;re over him after thanksgiving weekend .
we need his cabin .
otherwise the snow bunny shopping venture is pointless .
what are you doing ?
taking a selfie .
my followers are gonna flip .
so will your dad .
my dad doesn &apos;t follow me .
it wouldn &apos;t be so bad if he did , though .
are you hammed ?
fact check . my dad works with like a thousand guys .
he goes into the office complaining
about how his teenage daughter
is taking risque photos on line .
my numbers skyrocket .
you &apos;re insane .
what can i say ?
i can &apos;t help myselfie .
she &apos;s obsessive . so ...
she &apos;s literally obsessive .
she is obsessed with you .
had to hang out like 4 times .
i know .
sorry .
hey , i know you .
tara , right ? tara harris .
for sure . what &apos;s your name ?
charles .
uh , charles lorne .
i follow you on twitter .
and facebook and instagram
and vine , too . are you on snapchat ?
thank you , charles . share the love .
oh , i will . i will .
uh , i &apos;m herc007 .
you retweeted one of my comments .
i got 16 more followers after that .
that &apos;s great .
made me feel like a star .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m meeting you in person .
well , we should probably take a picture so you can prove it .
ohh ! hell , yes , that would make my year .
want me to ?
no , i think we got this , right , charles ?
there you go . make sure you tag me .
i will . thanks . thanks a lot .
you know he &apos;s taking that picture
straight to the bathroom , right ?
i &apos;m aware .
run a tox screen . i &apos;m guessing her severe pain
is another case of oxy withdrawal .
on it .
you have a patient suffering severe withdrawal right here , doc .
does he need an exam ?
i &apos;ll go run that test .
this is a surprise .
you got a minute to take a walk ?
yeah . not that i &apos;m complaining ,
but isn &apos;t quantico the opposite direction ?
well , listen , babe , you were asleep when i got back .
i knocked on the door and you didn &apos;t answer ,
and then you were gone before i even woke up .
so , i missed you a little bit . is that ok ?
true statement .
but there &apos;s something you &apos;re not saying .
spill it , derek . what &apos;s on your mind ?
well , i &apos;m actually kind of wondering
why you haven &apos;t packed yet .
are you profiling me ?
no . no . but i &apos;m not gonna lie . i did check .
and the profiler in me would say
that somebody doesn &apos;t think that we &apos;re
actually going on vacation tomorrow . am i right ?
let &apos;s just say i &apos;ve gotten used to packing at the last minute .
look at me .
we are going on vacation tomorrow .
i &apos;ll believe it when i see it .
come on , baby , don &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s not a judgment .
i &apos;m a realist and i &apos;ve gotten my hopes up too many times .
then prepare your cute little self to get surprised again ,
because tomorrow , come hell or high water ,
you and me , miss savannah hayes ,
are going to go find our own little touch of paradise .
ok ?
he tried blocking all of my accounts ,
like i can &apos;t get around parental controls .
and they &apos;re legit are taking my car to his office as we speak .
doesn &apos;t my dad realize this punishes him , too ?
he has to drive me everywhere now .
i &apos;m so over them .
college can &apos;t start soon enough .
i told you , posting that selfie wasn &apos;t a good idea .
plus side , andrew wells liked it .
maybe there &apos;s light after jonathan after all .
you &apos;re so redic .
ok , i gotta go .
see you tomorrow .
no !
no , please ...
oh , god !
local teenager tara harris found murdered
inside her home last night .
looks like a blitz blow to the forehead , then the unsub
stabbed tara before slitting her throat .
and he didn &apos;t stop there .
he then used her phone to upload that image
to all of her social media sites .
he staged a selfie ?
tara took a lot of her own selfies .
maybe the unsub &apos;s creating images to mock her .
maybe he &apos;s got something against vanity .
which could mean he has self @-@ image problems .
he feels ignored in his everyday life .
what if it was tara that ignored him ?
this could be his retribution for rejection .
all i know is if this guy &apos;s into selfies ,
we &apos;ve got a larger problem on our hands .
they &apos;re all the rage these days .
i know . cnn even does a column dedicated to selfies of the week .
it &apos;s all i can do to keep meg from posting them .
i mean , don &apos;t people understand the dangers
of putting their lives out there like that for everyone to see ?
if everybody &apos;s doing it , the unsub only has to look to the internet
for a sea of potential new victims .
unless tara was just a one @-@ off , this could be personal .
what makes you think it &apos;ll go serial ?
show him .
he issued a taunt .
he thinks he &apos;s just getting started .
&quot; naivete in grownups is often charming .
&quot; but when coupled with vanity ,
it is indistinguishable from stupidity . &quot;
eric hoffer .
匡迪科
post has gone viral .
it &apos;s already received over a million hits and retweets .
that &apos;s exactly what the unsub wants .
the &quot; fear me &quot; taunt certainly speaks to the killer &apos;s arrogance .
yeah , or vulnerable narcissism .
he feels like crap so he boasts to the world how great he is .
recent studies have linked the excessive taking of selfies
to narcissism , addiction , even mental illness .
maybe the unsub had a misconstrued bond with tara .
he wouldn &apos;t be the only one .
i &apos;ve gone over her subscriber numbers .
she has over 200,000 followers .
isn &apos;t that a lot for a 16 @-@ year @-@ old ?
yeah . it &apos;s massive . she was on her way to icelebrity status .
yeah , what was she doing to get all those followers ?
she posted pictures daily , videos daily .
mostly high @-@ energy , long @-@ winded rants .
she knew how to toe the line between right and raunchy .
maybe the unsub was attracted to her .
stabbing is typically a substitution for sex .
well , let &apos;s not rule out jealousy .
there &apos;s an unfortunate number of people
who attach their self @-@ worth
to the amount of &quot; friends &quot; following them online .
i don &apos;t think the blow to the mirror was coincidental .
i think she was looking at herself when she was attacked .
he &apos;s commenting on her vanity , which explains the selfie .
he &apos;s making a statement .
he wants people to look at him instead of themselves .
he feels ignored .
well , he &apos;s got our attention now , so let &apos;s make him regret it .
let &apos;s go .
sir ?
the media &apos;s gotten ahold of the story .
we need to contain this . this unsub &apos;s looking for attention .
getting his story on the news
is only going to make him want to kill again .
the man many are calling the selfie killer
has left many in this quiet neighborhood demanding answers .
move back , please .
now back to our breaking news story .
our reporter cynthia wilson is live at the scene of the attack .
cynthia , what &apos;s happening there ?
what can you tell us ?
it looks like federal agents
are arriving on the scene now .
we &apos;ll see if we can get a statement .
agents , can you tell us what happened here ?
no comment .
will the selfie killer strike again ?
agents , i &apos;m detective dawn rosenburg .
ssa derek morgan ,
this is dr. spencer reid .
what can you tell us ?
on paper , tara harris seems like the average
high school student .
not all that impressive grades ,
but heavily involved in social media .
our technical analyst is looking into that .
she has our entire i.t. department tasked
with trying to take the picture down off the web .
so like you probably already know .
well , the internet is forever .
looks like the assailant got into the open window ,
then headed upstairs to tara &apos;s bedroom .
how did the unsub know where she lived ?
boom for your boo .
yeah , baby girl , did tara &apos;s photos
have gps markings in their electronic footprints ?
no , but she may as well
have sent an e @-@ vite to the unsub .
she regularly checked in at a foursquare location
which she tagged at her home named harris ranch .
did she mention anything online about her parents being away ?
she said they grounded her , left with the car .
looks like she was asking her subscribers
to send her video ideas , ways to wreak havoc while they were away .
can you figure out who had access to tara &apos;s check @-@ ins ?
yeah , but there may be too many to sort .
oh , come on , now , you &apos;re my miracle worker , penelope .
i know you can do it .
oy , don &apos;t write checks that bounce back .
and she never saw it coming .
the initial blitz merely stunned her .
the unsub punctured the victim &apos;s abdomen
before lacerating her throat .
what did he use to cut her ?
a jagged piece of mirror .
a shard from the one in her bedroom , i assume .
he must have worn gloves ,
otherwise his blood would have been at the scene .
so , did the unsub think on the fly ,
or did he plan on using the mirror in the attack ?
seems more like a weapon of opportunity .
but killing with a symbol of vanity , that &apos;s intentional .
maybe he brought a different weapon ,
saw the mirror and couldn &apos;t resist .
this killing was planned .
why deviate at the last minute ?
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s as organized as he seems .
impulsivity could point to inexperience .
or maturity .
the unsub could be letting his emotions dictate his actions .
yeah . too cocky for his own good .
that &apos;s when they usually make mistakes .
we appreciate your coming in .
and please call us if you think of anything else .
i promise you that we will do our best
to find whoever did this and to bring them to justice .
sir .
charles lorne posted a selfie with tara
just hours before her murder .
he also posted an inappropriate photo of her
while she was at the mall yesterday .
let &apos;s have dave and kate pick him up . i &apos;d like to speak to him .
you got it .
thank you .
going somewhere , chuck ?
don &apos;t you know by now
that cigarettes are bad for your health ?
i didn &apos;t do anything to tara . i wouldn &apos;t .
you posted illegally obtained surveillance photos of her online .
she was my friend .
you told me you met her yesterday .
and it was like we &apos;d known each other forever .
where were you between the hours 10 : 00 and midnight last night ?
at home , with trixie .
my chihuahua .
can anyone corroborate your story ?
trixie can .
ok , ok , i think my neighbor saw us ,
but i--i didn &apos;t--
you stalked tara .
i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
actually , you did .
and you will face charges unless you cooperate .
what do you want to know ?
did you see anyone with tara yesterday ?
yeah . and there was this guy with her .
total weirdo .
you were the last one outside of tara &apos;s parents to see her alive ,
and you were the last one to speak to her .
do you think he was already in the house when i called her ?
probably .
did anyone ever comment on the amount of selfies tara posted online ?
sometimes .
but that was her thing .
tara was all about tara .
she wanted to be famous , kardashian style .
do you think someone held that against her ?
i &apos;m sure people were jealous
of the free swag she got from sponsors .
but enough to kill her ? i just don &apos;t get it .
how did tara gain such a following ?
she started making videos of herself
talking about current events .
she was going to be the next jenna marbles
or ijustine .
she attended vidcom and other social media conferences
to cross @-@ promote her work with fellow youtubers .
ok , but why the revealing photos ?
she must have known they &apos;d draw unwanted attention .
tara didn &apos;t believe in unwanted attention .
the more skin she showed , the more followers she gained .
it was a business to her .
she made money off sponsors and adds on her sites .
so tara harris wasn &apos;t just a name ,
she was a brand .
i &apos;m interrupting ,
but i thought you should see this .
that &apos;s my page .
yeah .
and this is what it looked like yesterday .
why &apos;do you take down all your selfies , riley ?
it &apos;s not what you think .
there &apos;s this story .
it &apos;s gone viral .
look , just stop . i don &apos;t want to hear any more . ok ?
what got your panties in a bunch ?
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re afraid .
that girl was butchered .
no , it was more than that .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i just--ok ,
i think he &apos;s after me , too .
what ?
oh , snap .
you got the mirror man .
you must be next .
that &apos;s alexander chase .
he has close to 150,000 followers .
i bet he gets all the chicks .
i gotta hit the gym .
too late .
that guy was doing squats in the womb .
be back at 10 : 00 to pick you up ?
didn &apos;t he and tara harris
make that challenge vid together ?
dude , what if he &apos;s the killer ?
hey , relax . ok ?
i got one , too .
did you ?
guess i didn &apos;t make the cut .
come on , the cut ?
that was funny .
so the unsub &apos;s putting these images on people &apos;s selfies .
samuel clemens , aka mark twain .
a devilish version of him , anyway .
interesting choice .
the unsub must have scholarly ambitions ,
or at the very least , he &apos;s educated .
well , the story on the internet
is that if you get a picture like this one ,
you &apos;re on the killer &apos;s hit list .
yeah , it &apos;s creepypasta .
oh , that &apos;s internet slang .
it &apos;s a shared story that expands
as others contribute to the lore .
sounds like an urban legend .
yeah , or a bastardized bloody mary .
yeah , same principle ,
just with a new technological twist .
so the altered selfies appear random .
how do we figure out who the unsub is targeting next ?
it &apos;s a long shot ,
but if the victimology is personal ,
the next victim may be someone connected to tara .
we should check to see if any of her friends or family
received doctored images .
in the meantime , can you figure out
who photoshopped these images ?
not yet . whoever this guy is ,
he &apos;s posting to the users &apos; own accounts .
well , even someone with minimal hacking
skills can get around a password .
the original photos had gps tags ,
but the modified ones are missing that metadata .
maybe he &apos;s using a cloned cell phone ?
the unsub &apos;s trying to make a name for himself .
oh , &quot; selfie killer &quot; is already all over the social media sites ,
and some late night talk show hosts
have even taken on the mantle .
yeah , well , an ice bucket challenge this isn &apos;t .
so what &apos;s his end game ?
fear .
fame .
probably both .
he &apos;s a sadist and he &apos;s enjoying the panic he &apos;s creating .
the vic was alexander chase ,
another internet wannabe .
the unsub clearly has a type .
he &apos;s making a statement about people
who put their lives online .
well , at first glance , victimology could
be about their social media presence ,
but this is also the same mall tara visited before she was murdered .
alexander &apos;s girlfriend works here .
she doesn &apos;t have a car , so he regularly drives her to and from .
the unsub probably knew that .
a neighbor corroborates that charles lorne ,
the sporting goods store security guard ,
was seen walking his dog the night that tara was murdered .
so we know it wasn &apos;t him .
but it doesn &apos;t rule out a local who frequents the mall .
or somebody that works here .
did he post another selfie ?
yeah . but he upped his game .
&quot; fear me . &quot; hashtag mirrorman .
well , the guy named himself .
guess he didn &apos;t like being called the selfie killer .
go for greatness .
garcia , the killer posted another selfie .
does &quot; mirror man &quot; get you anything ?
mirror man .
does it ever .
mirror man @-@ ia is a scary place to surf .
i will grab a shovel and i will start digging .
all right , thanks , pen .
it &apos;s hard to sneak up on somebody in a convertible .
and he changed his murder weapon , too .
alexander was killed with a nail gun .
why switch ? i thought these guys
liked using the same kill method .
maybe he planned on killing tara with a nail gun , too ,
and saw the mirror and got distracted .
i mean , given his moniker ,
maybe it was an ironic twist he couldn &apos;t pass up .
hey , guys .
take a look at this .
i think it &apos;s time to deliver the profile .
we believe that the man we &apos;re looking for
is a narcissistic sadist
who is blitzing his victims with weapons of opportunity .
he sees these weapons as symbols of his victims &apos; vanity .
first the mirror , then nails in the form of a hashtag .
it &apos;s popular method of topic tagging on social media sites .
these murders are a statement .
based on the organization and sophistication of the crimes ,
we put this unsub in his late 30s to early 40s .
this guy &apos;s trying to make a name for himself
by building off the internet legend of the mirror man .
it &apos;s a form of ostension ,
when someone does the acts described in a story
in order to bring them to life .
we &apos;ve seen it before with the poisoning of halloween candy
and most recently with the slenderman case
in wisconsin earlier this year .
that &apos;s the case where two girls stabbed their best friend
because they believed in doing so ,
they would become proxies of a mystical being .
also known as legend tripping .
the unsub assumes the mantle of an established story ,
then brings it to life in his own way
by recreating the circumstances described in that lore .
in one version , the mirror man kills
by showing you your reflection .
in another , he spears you
with his razor @-@ sharp fingernails
if you capture his reflection in a picture .
hence the nail gun .
he &apos;s becoming immortal
as the stories and legends grow ,
fueling him to only act again .
this unsub probably lacks in professional and social graces
and is most likely subservient to his peers ,
although he doesn &apos;t view it that way .
his need for attention probably stems from
abandonment in early childhood .
and he &apos;s tech proficient , among other things .
he photoshopped this image onto the victims &apos; photos .
his distortion of mark twain as the face of the mirror man ,
it &apos;s very important .
william faulkner described mark twain
as the father of american literature ,
and this unsub sees himself similarly .
he wants to become the forefather of modern lore .
he &apos;ll be monitoring web traffic , media sites , and chat rooms
as he enjoys the panic and hysteria created by his crimes .
fear this , mirror bitch .
fear this , mirror bitch .
fear this , mirror bitch .
i &apos;m hoping to be home late tonight .
i know .
ok .
i love you .
what ?
you owe that woman something spectacular when this is all over .
ah , penelope , look , that was the plan , i swear .
work . it always seems to get in the way .
well , i don &apos;t buy it .
i know you .
there &apos;s gotta be some kind of balance .
you both save lives for a living .
if anyone understands our crazy hours ,
it &apos;s her .
ok , oprah , what do i do ?
stop making big plans .
commit to something you can actually make happen .
it &apos;s the littlest gestures that go the longest ways .
trust me . when i &apos;m grumpy ,
sam does this dalek impersonation .
he stretches his arms out like a cyberman ,
which makes no sense , but it delights me .
my point is , do something to delight her .
ok , i &apos;m done . back to this mirror man story .
there are so many versions to it ,
i can &apos;t tell which one is the right one .
all right , just breathe .
let &apos;s do what we do .
my cross @-@ referencing cuticles
stand ready to serve you .
ok . run a list of male workers at the mall
who were off the night of the two murders .
keep it coming .
all right , cross that with persons fitting
the projected age demographic .
i always forget how good you are at this .
ok , now cross that list with the people who reposted
any of the dead victims &apos; pics
or made comments about the mirror man in the last 24 hours .
ok , we &apos;re getting somewhere .
all right , garcia , we gotta run deep into the lives
of the people on that list .
there &apos;s a good chance one of them is our unsub .
how much time do we have ?
well , this unsub &apos;s killed the last two nights in a row .
with the media sensation surrounding these crimes ,
i highly doubt he &apos;s gonna take tonight off .
ok , so no time .
wait , wait !
wait , wait , wait , wait !
please , please , please , please !
please--
daniel osbourne , recent high school graduate ,
worked at bethesda fashion square .
that confirms our mall theory .
there &apos;s no indication he knew tara harris ,
but he did follow alexander chase online .
nail gun again .
looks like this unsub has found his weapon of choice .
look at his face . this is mutilation .
overkill indicative of rage .
unlike that displayed in the previous two murders .
point me toward the perp .
garcia , i need you to check on daniel osbourne &apos;s
social media activity .
does anything indicate the same kind of vanity
as seen in the other victims ?
nothing so self @-@ involved .
fear this , mirror bitch .
fear this , mirror bitch .
his last post was a taunt to the mirror man , though .
all right , thanks .
apparently the unsub didn &apos;t like daniel &apos;s mocking tone .
so he silenced his heckler .
this could point to a devolution in the unsub &apos;s psyche .
he &apos;s no longer interested in murdering people
as an example of how great he is .
he &apos;s murdering those who make fun of him .
we may need to lower our original age estimate .
good point , aaron .
this is almost tantrum @-@ like .
this unsub could be a teenager .
yes , yes , and yes , yes .
what &apos;d you find , mama ?
ok , factoring in a younger age demographic
with mall--thank you-- employees that fit the profile
and weren &apos;t working on the nights of the murders ,
i have narrowed it down to one promising standout .
connor holt .
he is a senior at sunnydale high ,
and he posts about the mirror man a lot .
when did he start ?
a year ago . and not only does this young man
work at a hardware store giving
him primo access to nail guns ,
he also has a juvie record ,
and he goes to the same high school
daniel osbourne attended .
i &apos;m sending it to your phones . you &apos;re welcome .
your majesty . you are the best .
i &apos;m a reflection of you .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
where &apos;s connor &apos;s room ?
upstairs .
what is this about ?
i &apos;ll be happy to explain
if you &apos;ll just follow me , sir .
fbi . stay where you are , connor .
don &apos;t shoot . i surrender .
please .
let &apos;s go .
i didn &apos;t do it .
then how do you explain
your obsession with the mirror man , connor ?
for someone who claims not to be him ,
you sure spend a great deal of time caught up in his life .
look , the mirror man is me , but i didn &apos;t kill anyone .
i created him , ok ? i &apos;m a writer .
i--i wanted to make a new urban legend
because i love horror stories .
this isn &apos;t a story , connor . this is real .
people are dying .
no , i didn &apos;t want that !
nobody sits around a campfire like they used to
&apos;cause nobody ever unplugs .
i wanted to create a-- a modern day bogeyman .
then why alter the victims &apos; photos , hmm ?
what ?
you must have known that
the photoshopped pictures were of people being killed .
no , no , no . that &apos;s wasn &apos;t me .
i can &apos;t even use photoshop .
a lot of people i know got doctored pics--
but not you .
no , not me .
why do you think that is ?
because whoever &apos;s taken my story
doesn &apos;t want me to stop telling it .
kate .
yeah , what is it ?
look at this .
it &apos;s a poem about the mirror man .
well @-@ authored . this guys knows his iambic pentameter .
wait a minute .
you see it , too ?
yeah , he switches syntax , the grammar &apos;s messy ,
then he used an emoticon ?
nothing else points to this level of immaturity .
connor wasn &apos;t the only one
developing the mirror man legend .
you can &apos;t just leave me in here .
i get a phone call and a lawyer or something .
hello ! anybody here ?
stop yelling .
connor , you don &apos;t need a lawyer . you &apos;re innocent .
you believe me ?
yeah . i do .
but we need your help to find the real killer ,
and you know him .
i don &apos;t know anything , man .
yes , you do .
you do . just listen to me .
we think the unsub decided to bring your story to life .
he may look up to you .
he &apos;s probably younger than you .
he may have aided in the development of the legend .
he &apos;s a quiet boy .
clings to his friends because they &apos;re all he has .
he may have recently suffered abandonment by a loved one
or lost someone very close to him .
william pratt .
he &apos;s a junior .
parents died in a car accident last year .
he &apos;s been messed up ever since .
the death of william &apos;s parents
probably triggered a psychosis .
idolization of a dominant role model in the wake of tragedy
could often blur the lines between right and wrong .
like slenderman .
childhood imagination took precedence over social norms .
i &apos;ll tell hotch .
i &apos;ll tell garcia .
agent morgan .
is this my fault ?
he looked up to you
when there was no one else to look up to .
i think he probably saw
your obsession with the mirror man legend
and just decided to bring it to life .
so it is my fault .
sometimes people &apos;s wires just get crossed up , connor .
it &apos;s tragic , but it happens .
this was not your fault .
it looks like william splits his time
between school , his aunt &apos;s house ,
and working a kiosk at the mall .
dave , have rosenburg meet you at the school ,
jj and kate , grab morgan and head to the mall .
reid and i will go to the aunt &apos;s house .
i &apos;m sending coordinates and pictures directly to your phones .
thank you , garcia .
yeah .
move !
fbi !
drop the weapon !
put that weapon down !
let her go , william .
stay back . i don &apos;t want to hurt her , but i will .
and then what ? you hurt her , we hurt you .
is that what you want ?
all right , where &apos;s connor ? i need to see connor right now .
connor &apos;s back at our office .
you put that nail gun down , we &apos;ll take you right to him .
no , you &apos;re trying to trick me .
no . no , no @-@ no trick . ok ?
we &apos;re here to help you , william , ok ?
connor , your aunt , we &apos;re all just here to help you .
i &apos;m not getting out of this , am i ?
that &apos;s entirely up to you .
here they are !
get out , get out .
go !
oh , god .
yes , sir . ready to roll .
ok , ok .
they &apos;re giving him an audience .
get back !
get back ! go !
stay with him .
medic ! we need a medic now !
what the hell were you thinking ? !
pulse is thready and bp &apos;s dropping .
radio bethesda .
let them know we have a pediatric gunshot wound .
hey , it &apos;s me . listen , i need your help .
we &apos;ll do everything we can .
move him to bed 6 . let &apos;s hear some stats .
single gsw to the thorax . bp &apos;s 90 over 50 and dropping .
he &apos;s lost a lot of blood .
we need two units of o @-@ neg .
tell trauma surgery we have incoming .
there should have been another way , hotch .
kate filled me in . she said the shot was clean .
how &apos;s the victim ?
no word yet , on either of them .
i shot a kid on national television .
you shot a serial killer .
and if you hadn &apos;t ,
the hostage wouldn &apos;t be in surgery , she &apos;d be dead .
you did the right thing .
the female victim is coming out of surgery now
and the surgeon expects her to make a full recovery .
and the boy ?
he lost a lot of blood
and there &apos;s some nerve damage ,
but he &apos;ll survive .
thank you .
is he gonna be ok ?
i think with your help he might .
there he is .
you &apos;re gonna be famous , connor .
you , me , and your story .
i never asked for this .
we &apos;re gonna live forever .
you &apos;re going to jail .
yeah , but , i mean , for how long , though ?
the kids do the craziest things , right ?
hey , wait .
um , can i see your cell phone ?
no one will ever believe i got shot .
what is this ?
you are coming with me .
where to ?
i told you we were gonna take a trip .
i haven &apos;t packed .
this is a trip you don &apos;t need to pack for ,
at least not yet .
now , why don &apos;t you stop asking so many questions .
why don &apos;t you stop bossing me around .
wait . isn &apos;t this the house you &apos;ve been restoring ?
come on .
what is going on ?
just come on .
derek .
ok .
savannah , it &apos;s really important to me
that you know that i &apos;m not all talk .
welcome to our permanent vacation .
just think about it like this .
the world needs both of us .
and there &apos;s really nothing we can do about it .
but we need each other just the same , savannah .
i know i need you .
what we do is important to each of us ,
but this , it can be ...
our own little fortress of solitude .
just you and me .
this is for us ?
if you game ?
living next door to each other
is not working for me anymore .
what do you think ?
i think i love you .
i love you .
welcome home .
oh , no .
this is dr. hayes .
this is derek morgan .
ok .
all right . i got it .
&quot; there is a fellowship more quiet even than solitude ,
and which rightly understood , is solitude made perfect . &quot;
