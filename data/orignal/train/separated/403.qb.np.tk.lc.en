w.s. gilbert wrote &quot; it &apos;s love that makes the world go &apos; round . &quot;
and if it &apos;s true then the world spun a little faster with haley in it .
haley was my best friend since we were in high school .
we certainly had our struggles
but if there &apos;s one thing we agreed on unconditionally
it was our love and commitment to our son jack .
haley &apos;s love for jack was joyous and fierce .
that fierceness is why she isn &apos;t here today .
a mother &apos;s love is an unrivaled force of nature .
and we can all learn much from the way haley lived her life .
haley &apos;s death causes each of us to stop
and take stock of our lives .
to measure who we are
and what we &apos;ve become .
i don &apos;t have all those answers for myself
but i know who haley was .
she was the woman who died
protecting the child we brought into this world together .
and i will make sure that jack grows up
knowing who his mother was and how she loved and protected him
and how much i loved her .
if haley were with us today
she would ask us not to mourn her death
but to celebrate her life .
she would tell us ...
she would tell us to love our families unconditionally ...
and to hold them close
because in the end they are all that matter .
i met haley at the tryouts
of our high school &apos;s production of &quot; the pirates of penzance . &quot;
i found our copy of the play
and was looking through it the other night
and i came upon a passage that seemed ...
appropriate for this moment .
&quot; oh dry the glistening tear
&quot; that dews that martial cheek .
&quot; thy loving children hear
&quot; in them thy comfort seek .
&quot; with sympathetic care
&quot; their arms around thee creep
&quot; for oh they cannot bear
to see their father weep . &quot;
ok you can go ahead .
blow mommy a kiss .
if there &apos;s anything i can do ...
thank you .
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
thank you gina .
thank you for coming .
i think you could use some air .
jack &apos;s ok .
i saw him with his cousins .
ok .
jessica would you make sure that jack gets something to eat ?
sure .
and i &apos;ll be right back . thanks .
what do we do ?
there &apos;s nothing we can do .
we just gotta wait him out .
you think he &apos;ll ever come back ?
would you ?
he &apos;ll come back .
i just don &apos;t know what he &apos;s gonna look like when he does .
we just need to be there for him when he &apos;s ready .
you know i broke my promise to haley .
what promise ?
i told her that i would catch foyet
and that i &apos;d ... spend the rest of my life making it up to her .
you still can .
you saved jack .
you know i may have the tools to do this job
but i don &apos;t know if i have the tools to help my son .
you have to ask yourself
what kind of father you want to be .
and when you figure that out ...
then you &apos;ll know what to do .
i meant what i said today .
things have changed .
and i need to do what &apos;s best for jack .
you will .
they can &apos;t be calling us in not tonight .
i &apos;m on it .
we can &apos;t go .
we have to .
i &apos;ll get rossi .
talk to strauss tell her to send another team .
there &apos;s no other team available .
nashville &apos;s calling us in .
second body in 2 weeks both killed on consecutive friday nights .
they realize they &apos;re up against the clock
and they &apos;re hoping we might find something they didn &apos;t .
guys .
i &apos;m sorry but we just got called in .
we have to go .
call me if you need anything .
take care of your son .
thanks .
you gonna be ok ?
i &apos;ll see you when you get back .
&quot; where we love is home--
&quot; home that our feet may leave
but not our hearts . &quot;
oliver wendell holmes .
two women dead in two weeks
both killed in their own homes
and no sign of forced entry .
floors were covered in rose petals .
quite the romantic .
evidence of sexual assault ?
none .
both women were last seen leaving their offices on a friday
and never showed up to work on a monday .
it &apos;s thursday . why are we only being called in now ?
the second body was only found yesterday .
there may be a socio @-@ economic pattern emerging .
the first victim bethany heminger
lived in belle meade melissa johnson in brentwood .
both are affluent neighborhoods .
yet there was nothing missing from either home .
what did these women do for a living ?
bethany was a defense attorney melissa a corporate executive .
two brunettes with similar features
in high @-@ powered professions ? that &apos;s not a coincidence .
these women most likely represent someone he knows .
all right so we need to figure out where this unsub is
meeting his victims and how he &apos;s gaining access to their homes .
and if he &apos;s staying on pattern
most likely this guy has picked out his next target .
we should check gardeners
housekeeping staff pool attendants floral shops
see if anyone worked both homes .
start working up a paper trail garcia .
find out where these women were in the days leading up to each murder .
like a genie in a bottle--poof !
all right . prentiss you and i
are gonna go check out the johnson crime scene .
rossi you and reid talk to the coroner
start working up victimology .
jj talk to the families and staff
and find a connection we can use .
i understand that all of our thoughts are with hotch .
but right now i need us all to focus on this case .
we have less than a day before this unsub will strike again .
let &apos;s finish this thing fast .
you must be the fbi .
landon kaminski .
agent jareau . we spoke on the phone .
yeah it &apos;s nice to meet you .
the mayor &apos;s on my ass .
two prominent women killed on my watch
and everyone knows we &apos;re bracing for a third .
well let &apos;s hope that doesn &apos;t happen .
where would you like us to set up ?
in here .
i &apos;m gonna need to issue a statement with the press .
every woman in nashville needs to know
there &apos;s a serial killer on the loose .
we need them taking preventative measures
to avoid becoming his next target .
the mayor thinks we should be as specific as possible .
every woman detective .
his first 2 victims may be from the same social class
but if we isolate victimology this soon
it may cause him to go outside of his own comfort zone
and then he &apos;ll be even harder to track .
better to stress hypervigilance
and shut down his victim pool completely
don &apos;t you think ?
yes ma &apos;am .
well the house has a security system
but her friends say that she only used it when she traveled out of town .
he killed the dog
hid it in a storage container in the garage .
she probably thought he was protection enough .
that was her first mistake .
she had all the precautions to avoid home invasion
she just didn &apos;t use them properly .
these are the prints that match the other crime scene .
it looks like he didn &apos;t hesitate to get them everywhere .
which typically would indicate that he &apos;s disorganized .
this crime scene screams of organization .
the roses
the dog .
he was a stranger to these women .
he didn &apos;t talk his way in he was laying in wait .
and he knew his prints wouldn &apos;t show up in the system .
he had no priors which means he was smart
and most likely educated .
this guy knew exactly what he was doing
and he made sure he had enough time to do it .
so he knew when she &apos;d leave the house
and when she &apos;d return .
he &apos;s stalking them .
it &apos;s only the victim &apos;s prints on the exterior doorknobs .
nothing on the windows the garage wasn &apos;t forced .
so how did he get in ?
defensive wounds on both women .
more so on the latest victim .
she fought back the hardest .
no ligature marks . they weren &apos;t bound .
so how does he keep them from running out ?
maybe he blocked the escape route
or maybe the threat of a knife was enough .
i might be able to answer that .
the stab wounds weren &apos;t the only injuries .
what do you mean ?
melissa johnson had a concussion .
bethany heminger a broken rib .
an initial assault to prove his dominance
make sure they &apos;re too scared to try and escape .
something else you should see .
both their stomach contents were the same .
chicken broccoli pasta salad
and red wine .
he &apos;s playing out a fantasy .
one he has to control .
he sets the scene with flower petals and wine
and then he cooks for them .
their last supper .
so he cooked and he cleaned up after himself .
why did he leave the petal trail ?
it &apos;s gotta mean something our guy .
he &apos;s not just reliving a fantasy
he &apos;s repeating it .
it &apos;s the same routine the same meal .
it &apos;s not just routine
it &apos;s proper etiquette .
what ?
take a look at this .
there &apos;s a handprint
in the center back of this chair right here .
he pulled this chair out for himself .
over here there are handprints on either side of the chair .
he pulled this chair out for her
poured her wine ...
and even cleaned up after the meal was done .
but up he something changed .
then he drew her a bath .
and this is where melissa johnson was murdered .
this is where the fantasy ended .
because she broke it ?
i would .
what do you mean ?
well after the initial assault downstairs
fine i &apos;m scared
but i &apos;m still looking for another chance to escape .
dinner wine dishes .
i &apos;m not in any immediate danger
so i can take my time wait for the right moment .
i do what he says because i don &apos;t want him to hurt me again .
but once he gets me in here
i am at my most vulnerable .
so fear takes over and she fights back .
because if she doesn &apos;t ...
home is where you &apos;re supposed to feel safe .
nobody deserves to have that taken away .
that &apos;s it !
all right right in there !
hey buddy it time for pjs .
can i watch one more time ?
i &apos;m waiting for mommy .
all right ready to make a wish .
ok . 1 ...
3 . blow &apos; em out !
nice job !
ok . happy birthday .
say hi daddy .
hi daddy .
let &apos;s give him a big kiss .
i miss her too .
can i sleep in your room again ?
sure
ok come on .
find anything ?
several people had access to each home .
housekeeper gardener pool cleaner dog walker
each with their own key and an alibi match .
any cross @-@ over ?
none .
we even vetted delivery people
an utility workers .
garcia do you have anything ?
there &apos;s no hits on the prints at all
but i did what sir derek there asked
and i created a paper trail .
there &apos;s no cross @-@ over between the two victims themselves
in the wee leading up to their murders
but they did run in similar circles .
how do you mean ?
they both have country club memberships
though to different clubs .
they went to upscale restaurants
private concert venues posh hotels .
they enjoyed a high @-@ class highfalutin lifestyle
an expensive one .
a lifestyle he &apos;d fit right into .
this guy is educated intelligent proper .
he &apos;s a downright gentleman .
the rose petals sent a pretty specific message .
he &apos;s romancing them whether they want it or not .
he &apos;s got the social skills to back it up .
hey garcia take a look at dating services
and social networking sites .
look for working professionals
and privileged elite .
check check and checkers .
back in a smidgen .
we need more .
have we figured out how he &apos;s getting into these homes ?
no sign of forced entry anywhere .
yet he &apos;s still gaining access to their homes
long before the victims ever get home from work .
i mean this guy needs time to cook
and set up his scene .
he &apos;s either got a key or he can move through walls .
we need fresh eyes .
all right listen up .
i want everybody to go back to the hotel
and try to get some rest . we &apos;re gonna have
to pick this up again in the morning .
we &apos;re giving up ?
no . we &apos;re gonna take a break .
we have to give the profile at morning roll
and none of us has slept since the funeral .
once garcia can get us a paper trail
then we can expand our canvass .
till then there &apos;s really not a lot we can do .
would you please turn the music off ?
but it &apos;s your favorite song .
how do you know that ?
it &apos;s the most played song on your ipod .
no ! no ! stop !
stop it .
you &apos;re ruining it .
i &apos;m sorry . i won &apos;t do it again .
ease . i &apos;ll do whatever you want .
i &apos;ve put a lot of time and effort
into making this a special night .
is it too much to ask for a little appreciation ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i won &apos;t do it again .
please .
i &apos;ll do whatever you want .
that &apos;s ok .
i forgive you .
a little misunderstanding right ?
yes . that &apos;s right .
i &apos;ll just forget all about this .
yes please .
now ...
i think it &apos;s time for your bath .
ok jack listen
i want you to figure out
where you want to put all your toys ok ?
ok daddy .
alright sweet boy .
chief strauss i appreciate your coming to me .
oh of course . this isn &apos;t a time
for you to be away from your son .
come in .
jack can you say hello to chief strauss ?
hi jack .
hi .
have a seat .
so how are you holding up ?
i &apos;m ok .
and how &apos;s jack ?
he &apos;s coping .
i don &apos;t think he fully understands
everything that &apos;s going on .
oh right well how could he ?
you said that there was something
you wanted to discuss with me ?
yes i do .
this &apos;s retirement .
i &apos;ve talked with the director .
given the circumstances
there &apos;s no reason you should have to return to the bureau .
we can offer you full pension and benefits .
are saying that you want me to leave the bau ?
well obviously that &apos;s your choice
but i &apos;m offering you a way out .
agent morgan &apos;s promotion
was temporary
but he &apos;s exceeded our expectations
and i &apos;m confident that i could make it permanent
if you decide to step down .
the team would be together
and you could be with your son .
and when would you like a decision ?
i thought i would be leave with one .
what &apos;s your hesitation ?
i would just like to weigh all of my options .
whatever you need .
we believe our unsub is already with his next victim .
if he matches pattern she &apos;ll be a successful woman
probably brunette early 30s to mid @-@ 40s .
she &apos;ll be at home in nashville &apos;s upper echelon .
this means that he fits in . he drives the right car
he wears the right clothes he &apos;s highly intelligent .
he probably comes from a place of status .
this guy &apos;s sociable and he &apos;s endearing .
you would never suspect that
this man is capable of murder .
but he will do whatever it takes
to protect the fantasy that he &apos;s trying to relive .
it &apos;s this fantasy which fuels his drive .
he &apos;s recreating a romantic evening
and repeating it with each of his victims .
he most likely recently had a relationship
taken away from him .
so look at men who have lost loved ones
or have gone through a messy divorce .
but like bundy
these women are representations of that first loss .
bundy picked victims who had similar features
to the woman that abandoned him
and we believe that our unsub is doing the exact same thing .
these women were confident successful and strong
and they fought back .
which means he has the ability
to overpower them fairly easily .
he believes or fantasizes
he &apos;s in a relationship with these woman .
no matter how fleeting the initial interaction is
it &apos;s everything to him .
an invitation .
our technical analyst has compiled a list of locations
that the victims visited prior to their death .
these are high @-@ class establishments .
we &apos;re going to want to visit the same places .
so look for men who fit the profile
but also women who match victimology .
if somebody &apos;s been paying a little too
much attention to them talk to them .
get a read then jot their name down
so that we can check them out .
all right folks pick up your
canvassing assignments and get to work .
thank you .
the rain &apos;s supposed to clear up today .
it &apos;s gonna be in the high 50s .
what do you want to do today ?
there are a lot of good movies playing at the green hills mall .
you want to go see something ?
why don &apos;t we stay inside today ?
maybe watch a dvd .
i want to go on a real date joe .
i thought ...
after we made love last night
you &apos;d realize how much you mean to me .
don &apos;t you trust me joe ?
who &apos;s that ?
i have no idea .
erika ?
honey it &apos;s me !
you home ?
got a surprise for me baby ?
erika ?
grant help !
why do you have a key ?
run !
get upstairs ! go go go go go !
grant ! grant !
why--do--you--have--a--key ? !
no ! grant ! aah !
no ! grant ! no !
hey erika sweetie ...
why did he have a key ?
why did he have a key ?
house belongs to an erika silverman
project director in an international design firm .
we &apos;re assuming the male victim
is her boyfriend grant franklin .
male victim ?
mm @-@ hmm . they &apos;re both pretty beat up .
we &apos;ll need dental records for a positive i.d.
who called it in ?
ups guy . needed her to sign for a package
the door was wide open . we got him out back .
jj talk to him .
where &apos;s erika silverman &apos;s body ?
he changed his m.o.
multiple stab wounds to the face and neck .
classic overkill .
and evidence that she had sex before she died .
forced or consensual ?
no evidence of sexual assault .
she played along .
she had sex with the the unsub
because she thought it would keep her alive .
so why didn &apos;t it ?
this kill is personal angry .
she didn &apos;t give him everything that he wanted .
what else does he want ?
the dinner dishes are washed but the breakfast plates aren &apos;t .
he didn &apos;t clean up this time .
the boyfriend must have surprised him and disrupted his routine .
i don &apos;t know i &apos;d say he came pretty close to finishing it .
it looks like they watched a movie had an early breakfast .
she was with him all night .
hey garcia .
bad news buttercup .
great . what is it ?
no payoff on the social networking sites
and this erika silverman person
does not leave a breadcrumb @-@ like trail .
aside from a couple of online purchases
and some automatic debits she hasn &apos;t
used her credit card all week .
all right . thanks .
hey . so garcia couldn &apos;t find anything about erika silverman &apos;s
whereabouts over the past week .
no stores no restaurants nothing .
there may actually be another way
to figure out where she &apos;s been .
do we know where any of the victims &apos; cars are ?
as far as i know they &apos;re in impound .
we need access to all 4 of them .
4 ?
we should also get grant franklin &apos;s car .
he may have driven erika somewhere where she met the unsub .
there has to be something in the victimology .
if grant franklin hadn &apos;t come home when he did
erika would probably still be alive .
so how did the unsub miss him ?
it says he was out of town last week
visiting family in indianapolis .
still the violence of those kills
indicates he knew both victims .
&apos;cause the longer victims are with the killer
the more desperate the attack .
the unsub stabbed erika silverman 17 times in the face
grant franklin 34 times to the face and genitals .
it makes sense . the more he perfects his routine
the more invested he becomes .
detective kaminski have your men had any luck
canvassing the victims &apos; last known whereabouts ?
none . i &apos;m thinking of pulling them off for the night .
that &apos;s a mistake .
why is that ? the vic &apos;s dead .
if he sticks to the pattern
we &apos;ve got another week before he strikes again .
because he &apos;s never gotten this far before .
he &apos;s desperate to play out his fantasy .
a man like this isn &apos;t gonna stick to any timetable .
he &apos;s gonna try to finish this tonight .
jj we need you on the news .
narrow victimology . let people know
that he &apos;s out there right now .
i &apos;m on it .
we still don &apos;t know where he &apos;s finding his victims .
but we do know that erika silverman
lived in green hills .
that &apos;s 3 points and we finally have
our geographical comfort zone .
it &apos;s a good bet the unsub lives somewhere in this area
in this area
and erika is our key to figuring out
where they met .
oh man pancakes for dinner .
is there anything better ?
no no there are not .
hey jack who are these guys ?
this is you and this is the bad guy .
they &apos;re fighting .
who wins jack ?
daddy . no one beats daddy .
hey jack .
aunt jessica &apos;s almost got dinner ready .
i forgot what do we do before we eat ?
wash our hands .
good job .
come on .
he built those himself . i hope it &apos;s ok .
of course .
listen i really appreciate your coming over .
all your help and support it &apos;s been great .
he &apos;s my nephew and you &apos;re my family .
i &apos;ll be here as much as you want .
the bureau has offered me retirement .
what did you tell them ?
you know jack needs me now more than ever .
that means being here full @-@ time .
after haley and i were apart he didn &apos;t have very much
and that was hard
but i knew that at least he had his mom
and right now he really needs his dad .
of course he does aaron .
we both know you and haley didn &apos;t separate
beuse you stopped loving each other .
your job just got in the way .
your team needed you
and despite this offer i doubt that &apos;s changed .
maybe you don &apos;t need to retire .
what if i stayed with jack
when you had to be away ?
jessica i appreciate that ...
please ...
it would mean a lot to me
if you &apos;d let me help you out with jack .
for haley .
garcia &apos;s got something .
i &apos;m a girl genius &apos; cause this is what i did
i took the travel logs from the gps systems
overlaid their routes againts the geographical profile
to reveal what the paper trail could not .
which was ?
well erika silverman is the only victim
who didn &apos;t visit a private club
a concert or go to a fancy restaurant
in the days leading upon her death
she did spend a couple of hours
at cheekwood botanical gardens on tuesday .
garcia did either of the other victims go to the park ?
no .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s relevant then .
it is when her navigation system
reads in a straight line .
to work back home to work back home .
i don &apos;t think she ever left her house .
she even had her groceries delivered .
what was she doing on tuesday ?
let &apos;s find out .
where is everybody ?
well jj and reid are checking on a lead
and prentiss is reconvencing with detective kaminski .
good . then we can talk .
rossi
it &apos;s his team .
i &apos;m not gonna stand on the way of that .
it might not come to that .
what do you mean ?
strauss offered him retirement .
he &apos;ll never accept it .
don &apos;t be so sure .
this job cost him his wife .
it cost him that a long time ago .
which is why he won &apos;t let it cost him his son .
what do you think he &apos;ll do ?
it doesn &apos;t matter what i think .
what matters is
whether you &apos;ll be willing to step down
if he comes back .
or step up if he doesn &apos;t .
i &apos;m gonna do whatever hotch needs me to do .
he &apos;s lost enough .
hey rossi .
you mind coming here for a second i want to throw something at you .
we profiled that
our unsub recently experienced a loss as well .
a loved one .
probably a brunette who ran in the same circles as his victims .
right .
what if love wasn &apos;t the only loss ?
i mean we assumed that because our unsub
could so easily navigate our victims &apos; upscale world
that he most likely shared the same
financial resources as his victims .
because of his upbringing his sophisticated behavior .
but that behavior is ingrained in him .
it &apos;s habit .
it something he would have learned as a child
not as an adult .
if he didn &apos;t have financial independence
but were still trying to keep up his social status
he &apos;d be hemorrhaging funds .
we &apos;ve been looking at this the wrong way rossi .
we vetted the maids the gardeners the pool cleaners
anyone who had access to the houses
but who else might go unnoticed
in a privileged society ?
garcia here .
garcia check employee records
at each of the venues the victims visited
in the week prior to their death .
look for men spending beyond their means .
a guy who &apos;s racked up a lot of debt garcia .
look at cars wardrobes
something that does not fit their current income level .
a scholarship @-@ funded private school education maybe .
as you can see
the park attracts a variety of patrons .
older couples walkers tour groups .
we &apos;ll hold an occasional wedding
or concert series on our upper lawn .
did you have any events here past tuesday ?
tuesday . oh we had a corporate fund @-@ raiser
between 4 : 00 and 7 : 00 .
that &apos;s when erika sliverman was here .
an event up here would be a hard sell
for women in heels
well most of our private events hire valets
to drive the cars down to the base of the park
so they don &apos;t have to hike it up the hill .
who has access to your keys
but goes unseen ?
and your gps .
dealerships program your home address into the navigation system
before your car even leaves the lot .
he had turn by turn directions straight to her front door
and the keys to get him inside .
thank you ...
joe .
please state your desired destination .
take me home .
culpepper valet company handled the
fund @-@ raiser on tuesday and ...
the same company had contracts
with the hotel lounge thany heminger frequented
and the country club melissa johnson was a member at .
that &apos;s our connection . jj get rossi
and prentiss to pick up the owner .
right away .
all right baby girl talk to me .
i need employee records and a list of venues
that culpepper contracted out to this weekend .
oh sug check your email .
it hit your inbox 60 seconds ago .
thanks penelope .
all right culpepper contracted out to 3 venues
this weekend 2 today .
we might be able to catch this guy in action .
unless he &apos;s already with another victim .
the man we &apos;re looking for
would have been assigned to cheekwood park on tuesday .
hold on let me uh pull the roster .
ok we had 6 guys at that site on that day .
he would have had very few if any disciplinary citings .
he &apos;s proper .
he appears to have had a gentlemanly upbringing .
he &apos;s a romantic . he would have talked about women
and love frequently .
he might have just ended a long @-@ term relationship
or lost someone close to him .
belser . joe belser .
him and his girl they broke up .
when was that ?
a few weeks ago . they were engaged .
do you know what happened ?
he was head over heels in love with her .
and she was sleeping with the best man .
the manager said belser picked up a shift
at the vonner street lounge .
yeah we &apos;re headed there right now .
ok . swat &apos;s gonna meet us at belser &apos;s apartment .
garcia did you find anything else on belser ?
ok . he attended southern charleston preparatory academy
on scholarship his parents died in a boating accident
6 years ago .
belser lost his inheritance in the stock market
and since then he has been racking up debt
faster than he can pay it off .
he was engaged to society magazine editor rose smith
until 6 weeks ago ...
when it was called off .
and the chapel was already paid for .
so he spent his entire savings trying
to live in the world of his fiancee .
she was his lifeline the society he &apos;d grown up in .
only to have her leave him and wind up penniless .
hey garcia i don &apos;t suppose belser &apos;s car
has a lo @-@ jack system on it does it
no . no such luck boy wonder .
need potential victims &apos; names .
ok . we &apos;ll get back to you .
fbi ! open up !
joe belser fbi !
if you &apos;re in there identify yourself !
it &apos;s clear here .
clear .
hey uh i think i found the meaning of the rose petals .
look at these .
garage door openers ?
universal garage door openers .
this solves the problem of having to copy the key .
some drivers are smart enough to use a valet key
but no one thinks to take a garage door opener with them .
that &apos;s how he got into melissa johnson &apos;s house .
we only found prints on the interior garage door .
we thought it was from he moved the dog into the garage .
people rarely think to lock a door
that lies beyond another locked door .
reid . he &apos;s not here .
a beautiful brunette
late 30s early 40s .
she would have been driving a high @-@ class suv or sedan .
she only buys high @-@ end .
no ?
thank you .

who made charges in our vip section tonight .
they have their own attendant .
15 names . only 6 were women .

annie !
i &apos;m trying to make this a magical night !
no !
no !
you ruined this !
fbi ! put it down !
it &apos;s ok . you &apos;re gonna be ok .
fantasy &apos;s over .
is that what you did to them ?
you hit them to shut them up and then forced them
to play along with your sick delusion ?
i love them .
you &apos;re finally gonna meet your soul mate joe .
in prison .
only you &apos;re not gonna be able to push him around
the way you did those women .
and when he comes for you
in the middle of the night
when you &apos;re least expecting it
you do me a favor .
play along .
how is she ?
she &apos;s strong . she &apos;ll make it .
but you don &apos;t survive something like that without scars .
scars remind us where we &apos;ve been .
they don &apos;t have to dictate where we &apos;re going .
i had a feeling i &apos;d find you here .
have you told her yet ?
told her what ?
that you &apos;re coming back to the team .
that fighting the bad guys is who you are .
i don &apos;t have to tell her .
she already knows .
&quot; what lies behind us and what lies before us
are tiny matters compared what lies within us . &quot;
