we fight .
no , we don &apos;t .
you yell and then you go silent .
i yell because you ...
we don &apos;t communicate .
there &apos;s no intimacy .
there &apos;s intimacy .
okay . all right . there &apos;s intimacy ,
but we &apos;re not on the same page .
oh , be-- because i don &apos;t do what you want me to do .
because you had an abortion .
uh , we &apos;ve done couples therapy before .
he has ptsd .
from the war , and she &apos;s had it , too .
from the shooting , but not at the same time .
we--we didn &apos;t have it at the same time .
and mine wasn &apos;t as bad as his is .
you lay on the floor of an or .
you choked me .
you quit being a doctor . so ...
for a little while .
uh , but now we &apos;re fine .
really ?
oh , sure . okay . we &apos;re fine .
i meant the ptsd .
okay . yeah . we &apos;re fine .
we &apos;re fine .
mm @-@ hmm .
except for the part where you aborted the child that i wanted .
except for the part where you held my hand
while i exercised my right to choose
and then four months later ,
you screamed i killed your baby in front of all our friends .
when you &apos;ve tried everything
but that headache won &apos;t go away ,
you can &apos;t stop coughing ,
the swelling won &apos;t go down ,
that &apos;s when you turn to a professional .
so ...
as surgeons , we spend years developing skills of perception
that allow us to see exactly what the problem is .
you haven &apos;t even looked .
amy , i am telling you , it is unresectable .
let it go .
i came all the way from la to show you this .
you could spend more than 30 seconds .
i am looking right at it .
it &apos;s a gliosarcoma that has invaded the carotid artery .
if you try and remove it , she will stroke out .
stop being a jackass .
i &apos;m ... she called ... she called you a jackass .
dr. grey , excuse us .
dr. grey , stay here . i need backup .
fine .
you just got out of rehab .
i want you to get on your feet .
but you can &apos;t help her .
look at his face .
his name is mason .
this gliosarcoma belongs to his mother erica .
he &apos;s a great kid . i don &apos;t know him that well ,
but he seems great .
i do know his dad well . his name is cooper ,
and he works with me and he is a good guy .
he is a good dad , which means he is the one
who is gonna have to tell mason that his mom is dead ,
that he doesn &apos;t have a mom anymore
because we didn &apos;t do anything .
you tell cooper you &apos;re sorry . you tried .
let it go .
i have a surgery .
trouble is ,
sometimes all that time spent
developing those skills of perception
can leave a person with an extremely narrow point of view .
and how are you supposed to argue with someone
who has science on their side ?
65 @-@ year @-@ old woman enters the er in shock .
presents with a pulsatile , expanding abdominal mass .
go .
ruptured triple @-@ a.
i would take the patient straight to the or ,
and access the peritoneal cavity
through a vertical midline incision .
nice .
you guys studying for the oral boards
in the middle of the day ?
just another benefit of having a study buddy .
you should get one .
i have one .
it &apos;s just that my stupid study buddy &apos;s
too busy trying to save her stupid marriage
to actually help me study .
well , you know what &apos;s better than a study buddy ?
a study lackey . check it .
hey , you .
brown @-@ haired girl , you &apos;re up .
uh , trauma incident or a surgical situation ?
you made your interns come up with study questions ?
surprise me .
a 12 @-@ year @-@ old boy fell off his bike ,
hitting his abdomen against the handlebars .
complains of progressive abdominal pain
and is short of breath .
breath sounds cloudy .
what is it ?
sloan 911 .
hey , if you want , we could--
i don &apos;t need help . i &apos;m an excellent surgeon .
you know it , and i know it .
everybody knows it .
i don &apos;t have to prove myself to anyone .
yeah , except to the american board of surgery .
考察外科医生是否达到一定的行医标准
yeah , there &apos;s them .
meredith grey .
no .
not grey .
yang , maybe .
yang &apos;s a cowboy .
kepner .
kepner ?
not kepner .
definitely not grey .
she spent all that time in neuro ,
and suddenly , she &apos;s chasing general .
she &apos;s unfocused .
you &apos;re underestimating her .
i think she &apos;d surprise you .
she &apos;d have to .
she will .
she &apos;ll have to come to me .
i &apos;d do an exploratory laparotomy .
you said that already .
i know .
the patient &apos;s still crashing ?
yep .
oh ! i gotta crack open his chest .
you &apos;ve gotta what ?
uh , relax . n @-@ not you .
good morning , chuck .
hey , karev and dr. peterson .
it &apos;s always nice to see you in peds .
thank you , dr. robbins .
uh , so , uh , chuck &apos;s looking pretty good .
um , his , uh , abdominal pain &apos;s decreased ,
and i think it &apos;s a good time to schedule a gastroscopy .
great , great .
well , then , you &apos;re in luck , dr. peterson ,
because i think that karev would be an excellent supervisor
for your first gastroscopy .
thank you .
okay , uh , megan . let &apos;s go schedule that gastroscopy .
uh , it--it &apos;s morgan .
what is ?
my name . it &apos;s morgan .
whatever . same difference .
carrie rissler is my patient .
has been for eight years .
i &apos;m aware .
she was given six months to live ,
but after a mastectomy , oophorectomy ,
and risky experimental biological therapy ,
i managed to save her life .
which is awesome .
d--no , it is not awesome .
it is a miracle .
and when i saw on the o.r. board
that my patient-- my miracle--
is undergoing a lymph node transfer
without my knowledge--
she came to us , dr. bailey .
said she brought it to you a few months ago ,
and you shot it down .
&apos;cause her extensive scarring makes her a poor candidate .
that &apos;s what i thought .
but then avery suggested we do some angio studies on her arm--
avery suggested ?
dr. bailey , this procedure has had outstanding results
for patients with--with vessels just like mrs. rissler &apos;s , okay ?
this--
this could make it worse .
it--it--it could even kill her .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
well , y @-@ you &apos;re right , it &apos;s not ,
because you &apos;re not operating ,
not after i speak to my patient .
you paged me 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 to get yelled at ?
no , i paged you 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 so that you could help me
convince bailey we &apos;re doing the right thing here .
you failed .
okay . so what do we do now ?
well , let &apos;s hope carrie &apos;s a little bit
more persuasive than you are .
dr. torres , dr. webber suggested--
unh @-@ unh , here &apos;s how this is gonna work--
i talk , and you listen .
you are here because you and your little pals
are all freaked out about the oral boards ,
and dr. webber suggested that callie torres
might have a special secret study method , right ?
mm @-@ hmm .
yeah , dr. webber &apos;s correct .
callie torres does have a study method ,
an excellent study method ,
but she &apos;s not about to just give it away .
callie torres &apos; study method has to be earned .
frankly , she doesn &apos;t think that meredith grey
has what it takes .
i think she does ?
i think meredith grey has what it takes ?
his b.p. was low and his vessels are collapsed .
we could only get one good i.v. in .
we &apos;re gonna have to get another one .
for her sake , meredith grey better hope she &apos;s right ,
&apos;cause today ,
today is gonna be a grind .
excuse me . coming through .
excuse me .
a grind ? really ?
it &apos;s a meat grinder .
oh , whatever . like you weren &apos;t thinking it , too .
hang in there , dom .
yeah , you &apos;re looking good , bro , real good .
you &apos;re lying , tommy .
i look like sopressata .
don &apos;t worry , dominic .
we just gave you some drugs for the pain . okay .
you &apos;re gonna start to feel better real quick .
what do you think , dr. torres ?
is this an amputation ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know . is it ?
what ?
no , you tell me , dr. grey .
does this look like an amputation to you ?
i mean , yeah .
amputate ?
no , you can &apos;t . i need my hand .
tommy , don &apos;t let them take my ...
all right .
whoa . is he--
no , those are the drugs .
they work quickly , just like we have to .
but you &apos;re just gonna cut off his arm ? i mean , i--
no , this is a teaching hospital , mike , okay ?
i &apos;m doing a thing .
grey , here &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna work .
if you want my help on the boards ,
you &apos;re gonna run this .
you &apos;re gonna decide our course of action .
you &apos;re gonna be the person that stands between dominic
and a hook for a hand .
you in or you out ?
i already said amputation is our best option .
oh . best ?
yeah , best .
okay , so book an o.r.
and fire up the bone saw .
let &apos;s move him out , people . grey wants to amputate . whoa .
dr. torres , wait .
i have a finger here .
i knew that already , dr. grey .
no , a viable finger .
look at the cap refill .
i @-@ is that bad or good ?
dr. grey , is that bad or good ?
that &apos;s good .
all right . so what do you want to do ?
i think we should take this thing off
and see what &apos;s left .
all right . time &apos;s a factor here , grey .
why is time a factor ?
because the longer his hand stays in there ,
the more we compromise his circulation .
tick tock , dr. grey .
so let &apos;s call up to maintenance and get a sawzall .
you really want to wait that long ?
uh , fire and rescue has tools .
better .
okay .
hey , th @-@ these tools , what are they gonna do ,
rip apart the grinder ?
to save his hand .
yeah , we dropped a couple grand on that thing .
you can &apos;t trash it .
to save his hand ?
mike , how long is it gonna take you to get that thing apart ?
i @-@ i take it apart and--and clean it every night .
we can get him out .
yeah . quick .
dr. torres ?
can you do it in under 45 minutes ?
give or take ?
grey ?
dr. grey what ?
do i think it &apos;s okay to let a couple of civilians
take apart the machine that &apos;s grinding their brother &apos;s hand ?
yeah .
let &apos;s do it .
okay . i &apos;m gonna need a set of allen wrenches
and a phillips head screwdriver .
make that two .
stat !
hang in there , dom .
hey , you paged ?
look , i can remove the tumor
and the diseased carotid together .
all i have to do is run balloon catheters
in through the femoral , place them in precise position ,
inflate them to stop the blood flow ,
do two arteriotomies ,
then feed a heparinized shunt into place ,
and reestablish blood flow .
that &apos;s all ?
oh , and i have to do it in 90 seconds .
any more than that , and she strokes out .
is that even possible ?
not sure . i would love to test it out .
we should set up a simulator .
uh , don &apos;t we need to get derek &apos;s approval ?
yeah , but that shouldn &apos;t be a big problem--
he loves to say no to me .
that is his favorite thing to do .
maybe you should refrain from calling him a jackass .
i can &apos;t help it , &apos; cause he is one .
maybe i should ask him .
would you ?
yeah .
he &apos;s in surgery , o.r two .
you just called me down here
so that i would go to derek for you ,
made me feel like it was my idea .
aren &apos;t i good ?
amazing .
i have always been clear --
you have not always been clear .
she loves to say that .
always been clear -- i do not want kids .
he knew that .
i did not know that .
you knew that .
i did not know that in the beginning .
what , i have an icicle in me ,
and i &apos;m supposed to tell a stranger ,
&quot; hey , i don &apos;t want to have kids &quot; ?
i &apos;m not talking about the icicle .
i am talking about after .
after .
no , i told you when it was relevant to the relationship .
most people would &apos;ve considered dropping a bomb
like that before the wedding .
that is when it would &apos;ve been relevant .
well , uh , you proposed , and we were married like 12 hours later .
so sue me if , in the moment , i was thinking of other things .
i @-@ i know the lymphedema is bad .
oh , it &apos;s miserable .
these are sausages , not arms .
i can &apos;t lift them .
i &apos;m in pain all the time .
i think ...
look , we just need to be happy the cancer is gone
and look at the lymphedema as ...
the price we &apos;re paying -- - the price i &apos;m paying .
oh , look ...
you don &apos;t think i felt awful ,
sneaking in here like a thief to get my surgery ?
but i &apos;m just ...
you saved my life .
you know how i feel about you .
you &apos;re a hero to me .
but i ...
i want to be able to brush my hair ...
hold my grandson .
erin had a baby ?
having one , in the spring .
oh , e -- oh , my -- she was just starting college
when you were first diagnosed .
i know .
you promised me i &apos;d make it to her graduation .
if you ...
really think this is a mistake ,
i won &apos;t do it .
o @-@ okay . you got it ? you got it ?
i got it .
so what &apos;s your plan , grey ?
okay , my plan is , they get this thing off ,
and then we assess .
right , but what if they don &apos;t ?
you need an alternate plan .
well , i don &apos;t need an alternate plan ,
because they &apos;re gonna get it off .
what &apos;d you do ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
the more you guys loosen that , the more he &apos;s gonna bleed .
should we stop ?
no , keep going , just go faster .
y @-@ you sure you have time for that ?
if you have something to suggest , why don &apos;t you ?
now you &apos;re just wasting everyone &apos;s time .
well , we have to get him up to the o.r.
or he &apos;s gonna bleed out .
yeah ,
well , his hand &apos;s still trapped in that grinder .
let &apos;s get a pneumatic tourniquet on his arm above the grinder .
that &apos;ll buy us a few minutes .
okay .
i can give you guys 15 minutes ,
and after that , i have to amputate .
understood .
we &apos;ve operated on worse .
lexie , she showed us a picture of a little boy .
i know . i @-@ it &apos;s clear that she is passionate ...
my sister is too emotionally wrapped up in this patient
to clearly see that she can &apos;t help this woman .
you know , it tells me that she &apos;s passionate enough to try harder .
yeah , well , all the passion in the world
is not gonna make her plan doable in 90 seconds .
you need to see that for yourself ,
fine , set it up .
only you &apos;re gonna be the one who sees a thing .
i mean , thank you .
dr. robbins said i would be doing this .
yeah , how can you do a gastroscopy
and read the index cards ?
come on . keep &apos; em coming .
congenal aganglionic megacolon , also known as ...
hirschsprung &apos;s disease .
typical treatment ?
a pull @-@ through procedure .
did you skip symptoms ?
uh , symptoms , right . sorry .
don &apos;t crap out on me now , megan .
morgan .
uh , symptoms , uh ,
severe and persistent tightness in chest ,
indigestion , blurred vision , shortness of breath ...
yeah , that &apos;s not hirschsprung &apos;s .
severe headache , nausea .
patient is 24 weeks pregnant .
yeah ? well , that narrows it down .
uh ... it could be p.i.h.
yeah , i &apos;d order labs and , uh , a u.a.
then i &apos;d take her down to the o.b.
so she could be monitored .
okay . yeah . y @-@ yeah .
you should -- you should probably do that .
are you gonna just stand there or are you gonna help her ?
morgan ?
when were you gonna tell me you were pregnant ?
everybody in this hospital knows that i &apos;m pregnant .
but then they -- they also know my name .
well , there &apos;s a good fetal heart rate .
the baby looks fine .
these are definitely not contractions .
list the symptoms .
i am not quizzing you right now .
no , your symptoms . chest tightness ...
nausea , shortness of breath ,
indigestion .
you mean like , uh , heartburn ?
page cardio .
you &apos;re having a heart attack .
there is no deeper reason .
there has to be .
there is no deeper reason .
i wasn &apos;t abused .
i @-@ i don &apos;t have a dark secret .
i wasn &apos;t mugged by a baby .
i just don &apos;t want kids .
nobody doesn &apos;t want kids .
people can not want kids . it &apos;s a thing .
that is not a thing .
well , it &apos;s my thing .
you &apos;re gonna change your mind .
you &apos;re gonna change your mind in three years or five .
you &apos;re gonna change your mind about having a baby ,
and then it &apos;s gonna be too late .
and you &apos;re gonna regret it .
and i will know and understand
that i made a choice .
i choose medicine .
i choose me .
i choose that over the remote possibility
that i might one day regret
not having a child .
and by the way ,
it &apos;s all right to never want kids .
some people don &apos;t ever want kids .
well , i want to know why .
why ?
in 2004,
i was removing mets
from carrie rissler &apos;s abdomen and pelvis ,
and decided to go for one near her liver
when she started bleeding out .
as i was trying to stop the bleeding ,
she went into heart failure .
i had to send her to the i.c.u. ,
tell her daughter erin that she was in a coma
and that there was a good chance she wouldn &apos;t wake up .
but she did .
and she still had two more surgeries
ahead of her and chemo and radiation .
her body is a battlefield--
i get it . you talked her out of it .
no .
you &apos;re doing the lymph node transfer ,
but not without reading every page of this file twice .
but we &apos;re supposed to operate in half an hour .
then start reading .
okay .
i &apos;m watching you , avery .
yes , ma &apos;am .
come on . i almost got it .
come on . come on .
b.p. &apos; s dropping , grey .
you guys need to be done now .
just one second , dr. grey .
just one--one more--
and done .
we should be able to turn back the auger and pull him out .
no , we &apos;ll pull him out . it &apos;s time for you to go .
grey , take this . you &apos;ve got the auger .
okay .
look , can &apos;t we just stick around and see--
there we go .
oh , holy god .
okay , so ... we &apos;ve got a piece of hand
with sort of fingers on it .
what about these ? can these be saved ?
i don &apos;t know . can they ?
boom !
97 seconds .
bite me !
wow .
sorry .
just ...
sorry . i just ...
i &apos;ve been at 97 seconds for 8 freakin &apos; tries now .
maybe not the ninth .
if i can find another stopwatch .
i mean , derek &apos;s probably right .
i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m gonna let her down .
he should know . i &apos;ve let him down enough times .
let &apos;s take a break .
let &apos;s go , uh , you want to get something to eat ?
i want something .
it &apos;s not food .
there &apos;s a guy who got his hand stuck in a meat grinder .
i ...
wouldn &apos;t mind seeing that .
yes .
okay , morgan , you had an acute m.i.
from a spontaneous coronary artery dissection .
are you kidding ? i @-@ i don &apos;t have any of the risk factors .
yeah , well , most likely , related to your pregnancy .
we need to get you upstairs right now .
dr. robbins , why are you here ?
we need to repair the dissection immediately .
my baby &apos;s fine , right ? you said that my baby was fine ?
morgan , listen to me--
if my baby &apos;s fine , why are you here !
lie back , lie back , listen to me .
all right , we need to go right now .
but it &apos;s too early to take the baby out .
he--he--she could have r.d.s. or get septic ?
the dissection &apos;s extensive .
we have to put you on bypass in order to fix it ,
so the baby needs to be delivered now .
she barely has any lungs .
24 weeks is premature , but there &apos;s a very good chance .
no , you--you can &apos;t say that , okay ?
i know what you can and can &apos;t say is very good ...
and you can &apos;t say that .
listen , my baby was born at 23 weeks ,
and it &apos;s terrifying , i know ,
but i &apos;ll be here for you .
we &apos;re all gonna be here .
will someone call my boyfriend ?
his name is the first in my phone .
all right . karev , call her boyfriend
and let him know what &apos;s happening .
i &apos;m scrubbing in .
she &apos;s your intern , karev .
yeah , okay .
uh , wait . uh ...
her name &apos;s , uh , megan , right ?
her name is morgan .
grey , i &apos;m surprised .
i wouldn &apos;t think you &apos;d be thrown
by a little thing like a severed finger .
yeah , well , it &apos;s just , it smells like pork .
there she goes again .
she &apos;s gonna yack .
would you quit it with that , all right ?
i gotta finish this thing before i go into surgery .
hey , where is your study lackey ?
of course the one competent intern in the whole program
just so happens to be pregnant .
and needs surgery for a coronary artery dissection .
morgan needs surgery ?
how do you know about morgan ?
everybody knows about the pregnant intern , karev .
there &apos;s my ride .
here we go .
if morgan needs surgery , then why are you here ?
my attending gave me a job-- call the boyfriend .
i left , like , six messages .
chris is a fourth year at the cleveland clinic .
i mean , you know how busy it gets .
how do you know his name ?
they &apos;re not just amputating
and fitting him for a prosthetic ?
no .
she thinks she &apos;s gonna be able to salvage the finger bits
and reattach ,
because she &apos;s cracked .
that &apos;s gonna be so much harder .
you know what else would be harder ?
going through the carotid .
for fingers ?
it would be harder ,
but there &apos;d be better control than going through the femoral .
all right . all right . come on . here we go again .
come on , mer . just a few chunks .
oh , come on . just puke already .
oh , that &apos;s a good @-@ looking lymph node .
you got it ?
yeah .
oop .
did--did he say &quot; oops &quot; ?
dr. bailey .
what a pleasant surprise .
the man said &quot; oops . &quot;
i didn &apos;t .
actually , dr. bailey , i just said &quot; oop . &quot;
he was picking up a lymph node ,
almost dropped it , but didn &apos;t .
let &apos;s make some room so dr. bailey can get
a better view of our every move .
as you were , avery .
y--you--you don &apos;t want a little more suction , avery ?
dr. bailey , while i &apos;m always glad to hear your perspective ,
i &apos;ll instruct the resident .
but your instructions result in &quot; oops . &quot;
we don &apos;t &quot; oops &quot; in my o.r.
let &apos;s try a little more suction .
with mr. hamilton &apos;s laminectomy ,
i want an epidural drain for the next few days .
yes , doctor .
you should at least listen to her .
look , i swear , you gotta stop encouraging her .
well , this is what you taught me to do .
you taught me to not give up until we &apos;ve tried everything .
because you can handle it .
when we lose a patient ,
i know if you &apos;re okay or you &apos;re not
because i &apos;m right there with you .
with her , i cannot do that ,
because i don &apos;t think she can handle it .
not now .
you are the one who is too emotionally involved .
okay , if this tumor had come to you from any other doctor ,
you would still be looking at it .
you are so worried about your sister &apos;s outcome .
you won &apos;t even think about her patient &apos;s .
am i wrong ?
you have to try .
i am . i &apos;m--i &apos;m trying .
we &apos;re supposed to focus on each other and breathe ,
and you &apos;re not .
i mean , your mind is totally elsewhere .
oh , so now you know my every thought and intention ?
we used to be able to look at each other .
and i &apos;d feel ...
like we were gonna be okay .
there is a reason we &apos;re together , owen .
there is a reason we &apos;re married .
please .
look at me .
all right . i &apos;m looking at you .
right now ...
i &apos;m looking right at you .
he has to stop holding a grudge .
he has to see me for who i am .
he has to take his little list of all my crimes
and rip it up , otherwise--
otherwise what ?
you know , i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
how about you stop thinking that you &apos;re the sun ,
and that i revolve around you ,
and that being a cardio god , maybe that isn &apos;t everything ,
and maybe what i need is worthy of some consideration ?
and we &apos;re back to the abortion ?
yeah .
yeah , we are .
i &apos;m ready for the transfer , avery .
dr. sloan .
yes .
you know that this patient has a history of
multiple surgeries in that area .
she sure does .
okay , then i don &apos;t understand why you think
it &apos;s a good idea to continue to dissect right there .
respectfully , dr. bailey , it &apos;s not entirely important
that you understand everything i do every step of the way .
no , respectfully , dr. sloan , i disagree .
i think it &apos;s extremely important .
now if you had read the file like you said you did ,
you &apos;d know that she &apos;d have massive scar tissue
exactly in the area that you &apos;re dissecting ,
so i think going forward
with that dissection is a monumentally stupid course--
respectfully , dr. bailey ,
the bulk of that scar tissue
is gonna be found near her axilla .
so if dr. sloan continues dissecting right there ,
i really don &apos;t think there &apos;ll be a problem .
and i @-@ i read that
in--in--in the file ,
the file that you-- carrie &apos;s file--
that you gave me to read , i ...
i did ... i did read it .
damn it .
oh , we &apos;ve got a big bleeder here .
is that subclavian ?
respectfully , doctors ,
i told you so .
okay , so i think it &apos;ll work .
if we cut down the macerated part of the finger ,
it &apos;ll be short , but it &apos;ll still be salvageable .
okay , but this thumb , i &apos;m gonna go ahead and say
that &apos;s not salvageable .
yeah , you &apos;re done here .
he &apos;ll be better off with a prosthetic .
no .
the thumb is responsible for 40 % of hand function .
without it , we &apos;re done .
but there &apos;s gotta be something else .
i mean , i read something about surgeons
using a man &apos;s big toe as a replacement for a thumb .
let &apos;s do that . let &apos;s-- let &apos;s use his big toe .
listen , dr. frankenstein , the big toe ,
it &apos;s pretty important , you know , for walking .
and he can learn to rebalance .
or he can keep his toe where it is .
this is a good fix . i know it is .
no , it &apos;s not .
dr. torres , it has to be .
the big toe is not the fix .
that is why we &apos;re gonna use the second toe .
it &apos;ll provide the same benefits ,
but reduce potential disability .
really ?
yeah , but we &apos;re not doing anything
without the patient &apos;s consent .
all right . tell me what you &apos;re trying to do .
i &apos;m going in through the carotid
with two catheters ; one in the proximal--
a carotid stick ? that &apos;ll kill her even faster .
damn it , derek--
amy , i &apos;m sorry , but you can &apos;t stop
and reestablish blood flow in 90 seconds .
i mean , i can &apos;t do it in 90 seconds .
oh , well , the great god of neurosurgery has spoken--
look , now i &apos;m--i &apos;m trying to help you .
but please don &apos;t put yourself through this .
you &apos;re too fragile .
i am not fragile .
i &apos;m a drug addict .
i &apos;ve fallen off the wagon twice ,
and i &apos;ve gotten back on .
that does not make you fragile , derek .
that makes you very freakin &apos; strong .
i am standing in a building full of pills right now ,
a fact that i am painfully aware of ,
but i am doing this .
that is not fragile .
okay .
show me what you &apos;re trying to do .
so you think there &apos;s a way ?
no , i don &apos;t .
but i can &apos;t stop you , so ...
i &apos;ll be here with you .
show me what you &apos;re trying to do .
i was right .
right ?
too soon to tell .
cut the crap , torres .
you two are gonna put a toe on a man &apos;s hand .
that was her idea .
maybe we are .
his toe ? ! are you serious ? !
maybe we &apos;re not .
tommy , calm down .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to yell .
it &apos;s just ...
that &apos;s weird .
yeah .
but if i say okay ,
i get my hand back ?
otherwise , you fit me for a hook ?
a prosthetic , but if you give the go @-@ ahead--
he gets a hand .
well , what are you looking at me for ?
take my toe already .
take my left nut if it &apos;ll help .
i ... think the toe will be fine .
i was right .
so ...
this is how you &apos;re gonna spend your time now ,
pulling strings behind the scenes
like some kind of puppet master ?
i am really good at it .
so i &apos;m a 2 @-@ month @-@ old baby .
symptoms ?
i &apos;m underweight , fussy , i belch ,
and when i vomit , it hits the ceiling .
you have pyloric stenosis .
these cards are so detailed . whose are these ?
uh , well , those would be the smart one &apos;s .
the only smart one .
what the hell ?
what happened to morgan &apos;s baby ?
wait . morgan had her baby ?
oh , crap .
one more clamp , please .
well , is it subclavian ? can you get under the clavicle ?
vascular clamp . it &apos;s still loosing , dr. avery .
how do you want to proceed ?
um ... i , uh , i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t know .
oh , he did not just say &quot; i don &apos;t know . &quot;
man , tell me what you see .
we &apos;re staring straight at the defect .
you think we should call in vascular ?
no , no , i think--i think we can repair this ourself .
um , maybe patch it ? stick--stick tie .
patch it ?
yeah . isn &apos;t that--
no , no , it &apos;s a good thought . get on that .
bovie .
sorry , dr. sloan . just a little distracted here .
dr. avery , let me give you one small piece of advice .
if there is anything ,
i mean anything , distracting you from helping your patient ,
you need to leave it outside .
oh , respectfully , i ...
this is your patient now .
yours .
uh , someone had better tell me what is going on
and had better tell me right now .
dr. bailey ...
you need to leave this o.r.
excuse me ?
this patient , my patient ,
developed a subclavian bleed
because we misjudged her adhesions .
but i am now doing an arterioplasty ,
which is not an easy thing to do ,
and you are making it more difficult by distracting me .
you are compromising my ability
to care for my patient , dr. bailey .
well , if you &apos;re telling me you can &apos;t focus in--
i &apos;m telling you , you need to get out .
now .
oh , dr. sloan , if you let your resident
speak to an attending this way--
dr. bailey .
i believe dr. avery made it very clear .
leave the o.r ...
or i &apos;ll have you removed .
get out of the way ! move ! move !
damn it !
wait . is that for the peterson baby ?
for the mother . it &apos;s not good .
all right . get outta the way !
come on . come on .
crap .
what the hell happened ?
we were barely in the nicu before he suffered an intestinal perf .
scrub in . i need your extra hands .
uh , give me a minute .
hello ?
yeah , this is , uh , dr. alex karev .
i work with , uh , morgan in seattle .
uh , listen up , you &apos;re-- you &apos;re fourth year , right ?
good . listen up , she &apos;s still in surgery ,
but she &apos;s critical , so &apos;s the baby .
you need to get on a plane right now .
oh , come--meredith and i do not do everything together .
the twisted sisters .
yeah , well , we &apos;re best friends . what do you expect ?
she has a baby .
oh , my god . that doesn &apos;t mean i have to .
i don &apos;t see why not . you do everything else together .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re a team .
because she &apos;s my person .
i should be your person !
be my person !
be my person , owen !
be my freakin &apos; person !
be my person .
he &apos;s dorsal dominant ,
so i &apos;m not going to use a plantar incision
to find the artery .
okay .
and i have isolated a good draining vein .
uh @-@ huh .
is that it ? you &apos;re not gonna ask me if i &apos;m sure ?
are you ... sure ?
yes .
okay , then .
you &apos;re impressive .
i am .
look , there &apos;s always been
a lot of hype surrounding you , okay ?
&quot; meredith grey , ooh , child of ellis .
ooh , isn &apos;t she so special ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to help me if you don &apos;t want to .
no , no , no , that &apos;s not-- that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying .
i &apos;m saying ...
you &apos;re tougher than i thought .
i &apos;m saying , you &apos;re smart . i &apos;m ...
saying--
okay , look ... you know ,
we &apos;ve never been friends ,
not even when i was with george .
mainly because you thought i was a freak
and you &apos;re blonde and very ...
and now you have a baby , and i have a baby ,
and we &apos;re both married , and ...
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m saying , we &apos;re both alike .
i &apos;m saying i &apos;ll help you .
you &apos;re not a freak .
and we can be friends .
every morning , five days a week ,
you are in my office at 4 : 00 a.m.
and we work , grey .
if you don &apos;t show up , if you are late ,
i will kick your ass .
we work , grey . we work .
and you &apos;re gonna pass this test .
you &apos;re gonna pass it hard .
okay . we &apos;ve got it threaded .
we need to position the balloons
and then inflate .
you need to get yours in position faster .
i think you should do it .
you can do it . you just gotta get in there faster .
okay , ready ? inflate .
starting the clock . let &apos;s move .
mr. price is awake and responsive .
and the rest of the post @-@ ops are done .
what are you doing ?
we needed two surgeons .
one on the internal carotid , the other on the external ,
controlling the balloons .
we &apos;ve almost got it to 90 seconds .
you think it &apos;s gonna work ?
well , let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves .
it &apos;s one step ,
one step of a very complicated tumor .
he doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s gonna work .
well , we &apos;re gonna go down trying .
that &apos;s all . thank you . you can go .
i want to go down trying .
all right . pick up the stopwatch .
ready ?
hey , little boy .
i &apos;m dr. robbins , and this is dr. karev .
you &apos;ve got a long road ahead of you ,
but we &apos;re gonna do everything we can to help you .
and your mom , too .
how &apos;s she doing ?
morgan ?
oh . i haven &apos;t checked .
i ran a pregnant chick all over the hospital today .
made her quiz me on my stupid boards
till she damn near died ,
and i haven &apos;t even checked to see how she &apos;s doing .
apparently , i &apos;m the only person in this hospital
who didn &apos;t know she was pregnant ...
because i &apos;m too busy worrying about
my own stupid damn self
to even make an effort to learn my interns freakin &apos; names .
it doesn &apos;t matter if i pass those boards or not ,
i don &apos;t deserve that fellowship .
you know why i like you so much ?
i honestly have no idea .
you remind me of me .
peds surgeons ? we &apos;re--we &apos;re vicious .
we &apos;re the most hard @-@ core surgeons in the hospital .
i mean , when i was a resident ,
i was ...
i was a full @-@ on horror show .
but that &apos;s what it takes to learn how to save
tiny humans like this one .
but do me a favor .
learn your interns freakin &apos; names .
we may not like it ...
but it really is important
to stop every once in a while ,
get out of your own head ,
and see the bigger picture .
dr. sloan , i need a word with you about avery .
dr. bailey , i have patients .
he was right .
avery-- he was ... was right .
she &apos;s gonna be able to use her arms .
so ...
why did i say no ?
you were being careful .
yeah , but she was my prize patient .
i &apos;ve done ground @-@ breaking work on her behalf .
you were a resident like avery .
you get more experience , you get more conservative .
c @-@ conservative ?
o @-@ oh , is that what success buys you ?
what , you get happy and then you get scared ?
don &apos;t want anything in life to change ?
you &apos;re a grown @-@ up . you &apos;re risk @-@ averse ,
&apos;cause you know risk has actual consequences .
that &apos;s why we keep residents around .
they keep us fresh .
are you telling me that i &apos;m not young anymore ?
i &apos;m trying to tell you , you &apos;ve arrived .
you pull that crap in my o.r. again ,
i &apos;ll report you to the board .
actually ...
finding out that you &apos;ve been looking at things all wrong ...
can be sort of liberating ...
what happened ?
you &apos;re fine .
you know , altman , she did a kick @-@ ass repair on you .
my baby ?
where is my baby ?
he &apos;s stable .
okay ? i mean , uh ,
that &apos;s the first thing .
he ?
oh , yeah . that &apos;s ...
i guess the first thing .
he &apos;s , uh , he &apos;s a boy , and , uh ,
he &apos;s , uh , stable .
but ?
he &apos;s intubated .
we &apos;re giving him indomethacin
to , uh , treat his p.d.a.
and he had a , um , spontaneous intestinal perf
that we fixed .
robbins , she &apos;s , uh , she &apos;s observing him right now .
listen , morgan , he &apos;s-- he &apos;s doing great right now .
and robbins is watching him , and , you know ,
when she leaves , i &apos;m gonna watch him ,
and , you know , i @-@ i talked to chris ,
and he &apos;s on his way right now .
okay ?
okay .
so , you know , i thought i &apos;d just hang out here
for a while with you , and , uh , you know ,
wait till chris gets here .
leave it at that , if that &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re hanging out here because it &apos;s quiet
and you need to study .
what ? no . no way .
you should .
i @-@ i would .
and suddenly you see new potential ...
new possibilities ...
where you &apos;d never seen them before .
done .
we have blood flow .
86 seconds .
call your patient . get her up here .
and that &apos;s all fine when a hopeless situation
suddenly looks good .
unfortunately ...
i &apos;m afraid our time is up .
