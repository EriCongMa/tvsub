yeah . derek working for the government has its perks .
oh , you want a harper avery .
um , i want to make an amputee walk using robotics ,
and if i win a harper avery in the process ,
i won &apos;t turn it down .
well , now &apos;s the time .
i mean , sofia &apos;s almost in school all day ,
and the time @-@ consuming baby days are over .
unless they &apos;re not .
oh , i say we quit while we &apos;re ahead .
yeah . yeah . sofia &apos;s pretty perfect .
why tempt fate ?
yeah , and i can actually finally have a thought .
mm . is that thought &quot; where &apos;s my harper avery ? &quot;
ooh . hey , maybe .
ooh . all right . maybe .
hey , frankie .
morning , dr. avery .
hey , are you named after that big award -- the harper avery ?
it &apos;s actually named after me , after my family .
how did you hear ... about --
okay .
hey .
hey . did you go home ? i must have missed you .
yeah , i had a 14 @-@ year @-@ old gsw . it was so bloody .
i felt nasty after surgery , so i went home to change .
cool news about yang , though , huh ?
yeah .
you really didn &apos;t know ?
i &apos;m telling you , the nominating committee
is totally separate from the foundation .
i &apos;m just like everybody else .
hmm . only way handsomer .
mm .
is that a swimsuit ?
yes , i ran out of clean underwear
and haven &apos;t had a chance to do laundry .
which is why you send it out .
we have a perfectly good washing machine at the house .
says the doctor in a speedo .
paying someone to do your laundry is an extravagance .
how much did that coffee cost ?
uh , 4 bucks .
so , that &apos;s like , what , six -- six a week ?
mm @-@ hmm . carry the ... that &apos;s like ... give me a second .
like $ 1,000 a year you &apos;re just throwing away .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m spending it on hookers or private planes .
it &apos;s a latte .
i &apos;m gonna get you one of those milk @-@ frothy things .
i &apos;m gonna teach you how to make your own latte .
will you do it in that swimsuit ?
hmm ? stop .
okay , so , there was a gang shooting last night ,
so the e.r &apos;s crazy .
and that premie i told you about -- she gained 2 ounces ,
and the nurses are like , &quot; doesn &apos;t she look fat ? &quot;
and i &apos;m like , &quot; no , she looks like a naked mole rat . &quot;
and , uh , my doctor got nominated for some prize ,
and everyone &apos;s really jealous .
that &apos;s cool .
not as cool as that .
yeah .
my parents try to distract me
from the fact that i &apos;m trapped in a bubble .
well , aren &apos;t you getting some test results back today
that are gonna get you out ?
yeah .
here they come .
come visit me .
my brother &apos;s room is end of the hall on the right .
well , there he is .
hey , bradie bug .
braden .
up high , champ .
hi , baby .
mom , why are you crying ?
oh , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t .
um , unfortunately , your t @-@ cell count is still zero .
your infection is almost cleared ,
but we were hoping for your t @-@ cell count to respond .
i get it .
but i don &apos;t understand why my mom &apos;s crying .
there &apos;s got to be other stuff you guys can try .
you &apos;re not gonna make me live in this bubble for the rest of my life .
dad ?
uh , it &apos;s not so simple , bud .
your body has no ability to fight infection ,
and the enzyme &apos;s not working anymore .
bone @-@ marrow transplants in kids with scid can be effective ,
so we &apos;re still looking for a match .
they &apos;ve been looking for a match for me since i was a baby ,
and they haven &apos;t found one .
what if you still can &apos;t ?
no other treatment for your disease exists .
we &apos;re working on it , but for the time being ...
your only safe place is right where you are .
hey , frankie . you &apos;re late .
i &apos;m not a patient anymore , so i don &apos;t have to be at rounds .
but you do .
oh . you &apos;re right . i &apos;m late .
want to race ?
yeah . come on .
oh , oh , oh ! i got you !
come on ! come on !
slow down !
that &apos;s not fair ! come on !
hey , linkie .
i got you a chocolate-
chip muffin for when you &apos;re feeling better .
well , how are you feeling , frankie ?
well , she just beat me in a race , so ...
oh , looks like that pacemaker i put in is working .
and iv--
seriously , ivy .
sour @-@ cream @-@ and @-@ onion chips for breakfast ?
you said i should put on weight .
mmm . good .
so , two weeks post @-@ op heart transplant ,
and ivy &apos;s indices are excellent .
and mr. link ?
lincoln mcneil , age 9 , end @-@ stage heart failure ,
awaiting transplant , status 1a .
there &apos;s a family history of the disease .
the cause is still unknown .
uh , link first showed signs of cardiomyopathy two weeks ago
and has deteriorated rapidly .
an attempt to put him on a berlin heart failed ...
due to something i can &apos;t remember .
clotting .
that &apos;s it .
uh , the patient is now on ecmo and is ...
stable .
i couldn &apos;t have said it better myself .
thanks . so , where are we with unos ?
well , link is at the top of the list .
how much longer can he survive on ecmo ?
well , with sweep numbers this low ...
at least a week .
so , we pray for a miracle ?
we got one with ivy .
we &apos;re not just sitting around and waiting .
we are aggressively looking at other options .
in the meantime ...
... heart @-@ healthy food , okay ?
so , i put a call in to these guys from stanford
who are doing animal testing with a drug @-@ eluting pump
to prevent clotting .
never been tried on humans , but link is a little kid .
the fit might be right . it could work .
i &apos;ll let you guys know what they say .
so , that &apos;s how you &apos;re gonna play this --
act like it &apos;s just another day at the office ?
it is .
no , see i need details .
so , w @-@ what did they say ?
&quot; congratulations . &quot;
and then what did you say ?
&quot; thank you . &quot;
cristina , i just don &apos;t -- - no , no , really , really ,
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s just a nomination .
i &apos;m happy about it , but i &apos;ve got a ton of work to do .
i @-@ i want to focus on that .
i really don &apos;t want to make a big deal out of it .
hey , hey . uh ... let &apos;s go this way . yeah .
you know , get some ... breakfast ? mm .
why ? i got my chips .
surprise !
whose idea was this ?
meredith &apos;s .
congratulations .
第十季 第十九集
&quot; i &apos;m winning &quot;
innovation . imagination . excellence .
oh , soak it in , doctors .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s all around you .
it &apos;s mostly hovering around dr. yang ,
and shane &apos;s kind of hogging her .
i &apos;m not just talking about dr. yang .
dr. shepherd is testing a new machine
that can read emotions and has applications
for the work that he and dr. torres are doing .
torres ! me !
hey , dr. grey is about to do the first
hiv @-@ positive @-@ to @-@ positive kidney transplant in the state
since the new law went into effect in november .
that &apos;s history in the making . it &apos;s mine .
a @-@ and dr . bailey &apos;s looking for
a genetic cure for a kid who lacks an immune system .
edwards ?
i was on her service yesterday . she &apos;s not doing anything .
she &apos;s just staring at her computer screen .
that is not nothing . she &apos;s thinking .
h @-@ her brain is turning ,
building up to that moment of -- of inspiration .
it &apos;ll look like nothing , but in a moment ,
pow ! 4th of july .
don &apos;t blink . you &apos;ll miss it .
it was like that with me and yang at first , too .
a lot of staring at computer screens ,
and now look at us .
oh , shane .
oh , shane , shane , shane .
no .
i wasn &apos;t gonna do this to you today .
i really wasn &apos;t . was i , ladies ?
she wasn &apos;t . hand to god .
but you just got too big for your britches .
it &apos;s not even interesting stuff .
i &apos;m just in the printing lab making sample conduits .
well , not anymore , swap monkey !
enjoy working with dr. bailey .
pow ! 4th of july !
sucks .
swap monkey !
okay , guys , bear with me .
i know we &apos;ve gone through all this before ,
but the hospital just needs your consent one more time .
go ahead , murphy . state your name .
keith kalber .
keith , you understand that the kidney you &apos;re getting today
is being donated from a person infected with hiv ?
i should hope so .
i was there the day he got his diagnosis .
and although small , there is a risk of superinfection
by mixing his strain of the virus with yours .
knowing this , do you still wish to proceed ?
i do .
god , it feels like we &apos;re getting married .
how would you know how that feels ?
excuse me ?
he always has the best boyfriends ,
but he refuses to commit .
can we just get back to my huge sacrifice ?
marty you understand
that the risks of donation are similar to those involved
with any major surgery , such as bleeding and infection ?
and death resulting from kidney donation
is extremely rare .
define ... &quot; extremely . &quot;
uh , .06 % .
oh .
we &apos;ve beaten worse odds .
oh , yeah .
now , before we drill into someone &apos;s brain ,
we need to make sure they &apos;re good candidates for robotics work .
they need to be motivated , stable ,
and neurologically healthy .
this machine gives us a window into all that .
mm @-@ hmm . yeah , you &apos;re gonna be our baseline .
so , we &apos;re just gonna show you some pictures ,
and all you need to do is look at them .
okay , wilson , you ready ?
mm . that &apos;s the amygdala , right ?
it &apos;s fired up by powerful negative emotions ,
like fear , rage , anger , hate .
okay , now let &apos;s take a look
at her nucleus accumbens .
her pleasure center ?
mm @-@ hmm .
hmm .
that &apos;s not supposed to happen .
wilson , what &apos;s wrong with you ? you don &apos;t like cats ?
hate &apos; em .
what &apos;s wrong with the beach ?
sand in my eyes , skin cancer ,
vacations i never got to take as a child .
uh @-@ oh . open , comminuted radius fracture in the e.r.
there we go . look at that .
took a broken arm to make her happy .
huh .
i turned her on to ortho a few weeks ago . watch this .
hey , wilson , you want to go set that arm yourself ?
i love our new toy .
yang get too fancy for you ,
kicked you down here to the &quot; b &quot; team ?
oh , no . i , uh wanted to see the work you &apos;re doing .
genome sequencing is the future of medicine .
may not be a fancy surgery , but it &apos;s gonna save lives .
you want to save lives or go to fancy award dinners ?
save lives .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
i &apos;m happy for dr. yang . why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
i trained her , molded her .
it &apos;s almost like it &apos;s my nomination , too .
keith and marty are good to go .
ah , yes -- your high @-@ profile kidney transplant .
i thought you were harvesting the donor .
yeah , while you do the award @-@ winning stuff .
uh , yeah , i remember .
page me when you &apos;re ready .
trained her , too .
thank you so much for getting back to me .
i hear you &apos;re developing , uh , a drug @-@ eluting cardiac pump
that &apos;s getting excellent results in sheep .
oh . yes , that &apos;s me .
uh , well , there are four other excellent surgeons
who are nominated .
thank you . um ...
uh , yes . anyway , i have a young patient .
he &apos;s on day 10 of ecmo
and has , uh , protein &quot; s &quot; deficiency .
sorry ?
i &apos;m 3 @-@ d printing , uh , conduits for hlhs patients .
uh @-@ huh . yeah .
uh , well , i think my patient would be an excellent candidate
for a compassionate release .
in here .
i @-@ i see .
oh , god . oh , no , no , no . what ?
the little boy &apos;s ecmo circuit clotted off ,
and he &apos;s not responding to fluids .
um , page dr. hunt and , um , dr. robbins .
okay , let &apos;s get him off that bed ...
dr. yang ?
dr , yang , is everything all right ?
dr , yang ? hello ?
she can &apos;t talk right now .
he &apos;s clotting , even on the heparin .
i can &apos;t give him any more or he &apos;ll bleed out ,
and i can &apos;t give him any less or he &apos;ll keep clotting .
we need the stanford artificial heart .
we can &apos;t have it .
what ?
it &apos;s not them . they want to let us try .
it &apos;s the fda .
they &apos;re being conservative
and insisting on one more animal trial .
they &apos;re six months away from approval .
okay , so what do we do ?
we hope unos calls .
today .
yeah .
okay , time to get you prepped and ready for --
i can &apos;t do it .
uh , keith &apos;s right .
i mean , w @-@ w @-@ w @-@ we &apos;ve beaten huge odds .
i mean , we &apos;re still alive while so many of our friends died .
and i &apos;ve been healthy for so long now .
y-- you get a little cocky .
you forget how lucky you are .
and i ...
i @-@ i &apos;m the most horrible friend , but i just ...
i &apos;m scared .
w @-@ what if i &apos;m one of the .06 % ?
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t think i can give him my kidney .
have you told keith ?
h @-@ h @-@ he &apos;s been suffering for so long ,
a @-@ and when the law was passed , he was so happy .
and then i turned out to be a perfect match .
a @-@ and now ...
how can i look my best friend in the eye
and tell him i won &apos;t save his life ?
it is unfortunate , but ... it does happen .
we misread the screening , and it turns out
that marty is not a suitable donor .
i don &apos;t understand .
yeah , uh , this is outrageous .
i &apos;m -- i @-@ i &apos;m -- i &apos;m completely shocked .
so were we .
shocked and disappointed .
so , what now ?
well , you &apos;ll continue on dialysis
and go back on the transplant list .
you know , it &apos;s ironic .
i spend years fighting hiv .
i get myself to the point
where the virus is virtually nonexistent in my body .
i survive .
and now i die of kidney disease .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
it &apos;s not your fault . you tried .
you -- you -- you stepped up .
oh , god .
i don &apos;t know what i would do without you .
what do you do for a living ?
i &apos;m an orthopedic surgeon .
do you enjoy your work ?
i love it .
are you married ?
yep .
any kids ?
uh , one .
would you consider yourself a happy person ?
extremely .
and you want to participate in this project ?
i do .
no .
&quot; no &quot; what ?
uh , judging by these results , i &apos;d say you are depressed ,
and i would turn you away from the study .
i &apos;m not depressed .
oh , it &apos;s no big deal .
we can get somebody else to give us a baseline --
derek , i &apos;m not depressed .
show me the kitten .
yeah . see ?
i &apos;m happy .
am i happy ?
nope .
well ...
okay , well , uh --
no ! why are you --
i -- i really do love kittens .
i do .
hey , dr. torres said you have a thing for bones .
when you &apos;re done with her patient ,
you want to do a mandibular o.r.i.f. ?
yes !
i see you have another beverage .
iced tea , actually . it &apos;s quite good .
would you like some ?
oh , i &apos;m perfectly happy with my water .
is that a -- - her swimsuit . yeah . racerback .
i ran out of underwear .
i &apos;m not understanding .
you don &apos;t wear swimsuits
when you run out of clean underwear ?
i don &apos;t run out of clean underwear .
you &apos;re a resident . when do you have time to do laundry ?
i &apos;m a doctor . i send it out .
the incision looks good .
where are my parents ?
they went to check out a support group we have
for dealing with tough stuff .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s stuck in here .
you want to talk about it ?
no .
want to play checkers ?
no .
chess ?
no .
come on . you got to let me beat you at something .
i kind of feel like playing with someone my own age .
whoa ! whoa ! careful .
you &apos;re gonna rip through the plastic .
that &apos;s the point .
surgery &apos;s off .
it &apos;s off ?
donor backed out .
please tell cristina i &apos;m thrilled for her .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;d love to hear it from you .
and i would love to have that conversation ,
but i am busy trying to find a way
for a gene to proliferate in the body of a young boy .
so i would be most grateful if you would extend
my heartfelt congratulations to dr. yang for me .
um ... okay .
you said he was stable .
you said he had at least one more week on ecmo .
w @-@ we thought that we had it under control ,
and we didn &apos;t expect for him to clot .
and six months ago , i didn &apos;t expect any of this .
i was in a carpool line picking up
my three happy , healthy kids from school .
and now --
now i have two kids in end @-@ stage heart failure
and one-- one being kept alive with a pacemaker .
you guys can &apos;t tell me why my kids are sick ,
and-- and now you &apos;re scratching your heads ,
telling me that there &apos;s nothing more you can do for link
except-- except for wait ?
i thought you were supposed
to be some award @-@ winning doctor .
frankie .
my parents keep saying you &apos;re doing your best ,
but your best is bad .
frankie , wait !
frankie !
dr. yang ?
i &apos;m a ... intern here .
i just want to say congratulations .
you are totally gonna win .
are you from the future ?
no .
then shut up .
she means &quot; thank you . &quot;
anybody want some meatloaf ?
isn &apos;t that the meatloaf you had yesterday ?
yep . and the day before that .
probably gonna have it tomorrow , too ,
&apos;cause there &apos;s still a piece left at home .
jackson doesn &apos;t eat leftovers , you see .
he says he finds it depressing
to eat food out of a tupperware container .
you know what i find depressing ?
paying $ 7 for a hamburger .
make her stop .
her , too .
hey .
it was low blood sugar , shepherd .
take that food to go . we &apos;re gonna do this again .
come on ! come on ! let &apos;s go !
there she is .
the future of medicine .
how &apos;s it feel ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
o @-@ kay .
your mother was the same way .
didn &apos;t you have that meatloaf yesterday ?
mm @-@ hmm . mm @-@ hmm . yep .
and the day before that .
and probably gonna have it tomorrow .
dr. grey ?
you &apos;re gonna kill me .
i &apos;m gonna thank my parents , obviously .
why ? they didn &apos;t help you win the harper avery .
they gave birth to me .
they should be publicly acknowledged .
i don &apos;t have parents ,
so i &apos;m not gonna waste any of my speech on them .
it &apos;s gonna be all about me . humble but ...
self @-@ involved .
exactly .
can you stop ?
what &apos;s wrong , shane ?
swap monkey misses his conduits ?
please-- swap back .
bailey says she &apos;s on the verge .
no , bailey &apos;s been on the verge for days .
i &apos;m keeping yang .
where is it ? !
what are you looking for ?
i &apos;m looking for a picture of the harper avery .
it &apos;s my screen saver .
i know what the harper avery looks like .
i &apos;m looking for a picture of ellis grey &apos;s harper avery .
why ?
i remember being in medical school
and looking at these old medical journals
and seeing a picture of her from the first time she won .
she was young . she was like 35 or something .
i &apos;m almost 35 .
you &apos;re 27 .
my life is stupid and ordinary .
and ... i don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m doing here .
i &apos;m never gonna win a harper avery .
i might as well just move to a farm and grow vegetables .
at least i &apos;d be doing something useful .
her transplant got canceled .
you want to be on bailey ?
oh , my god . oh , my god !
oh , my god !
ooh ! fries ! yeah !
the surgery is back on ?
well , kind of .
marty felt terrible , so he &apos;s back on board .
but we told keith that they weren &apos;t a good match .
you did what ?
they &apos;re best friends , and i was trying to help .
you got emotionally involved . rookie mistake .
i am not a rookie .
but i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m gonna go back and explain this .
oh , i do .
dr. grey misread the labs .
her relative inexperience led to a terrible error .
you two are , in fact , a perfect match .
i mean , this is such great news .
so sorry , keith .
i &apos;m willing to just put all this behind me and move forward .
well , you know how these young surgeons are .
it &apos;s all about p.r. and awards , and they get sloppy .
he said he &apos;s ready to move forward .
luckily , i &apos;m available to do your transplant ,
and i assure you i am substance over flash .
i thought you were doing marty &apos;s surgery .
well , i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t mind taking dr. grey .
well , why should you settle ?
well , she &apos;s , you know , just taking out my kidney .
how hard could it be , you know ?
but she can barely read a lab report .
you don &apos;t know if she &apos;s gonna
mistake your gallbladder for your kidney .
guys , i assure you-- i &apos;m an excellent surgeon .
why don &apos;t i get another doctor to do marty &apos;s surgery ?
what ? !
... a good idea .
yes .
yes .
thank you .
listen , we need this device .
this will buy the kid time until a heart becomes available .
that &apos;s crap ! you &apos;re the fda !
you make the rules !
i just set a broken radius
and assisted on mandibular o.r.i.f.
how great is this day ?
mm . my kid &apos;s trapped in a bubble for the rest of his life .
you and bailey will figure it out .
that &apos;s how great this day is .
imagination and innovation are everywhere .
i &apos;m seeing a lot of misery and failure .
alex .
should i take the private @-@ practice job ?
i thought you &apos;d already decided
that you were gonna call dr. butthole and --
so yang &apos;s winning awards , and i &apos;m selling out ?
you &apos;re not a sellout for taking a job
doing something that you love .
private practice was never the plan .
it was never supposed to be about the money .
well , there &apos;s nothing wrong with making money .
what am i gonna buy ?
a condo in aspen ? i don &apos;t even ski .
not everyone who &apos;s rich is an ass .
you could take the job and not be an ass .
braden ?
braden !
braden !
braden , where are you ? !
where is he ? ! where is my son ? !
we can &apos;t find him !
braden !
whoa ! whoa ! watch it !
i &apos;m gonna get you !
no , you &apos;re not !
no running in the hall .
i got you !
no , you didn &apos;t !
you &apos;re totally it .
frankie ! don &apos;t touch him !
braden !
you can &apos;t . he &apos;s immuno @-@ compromised .
any more exposure--
even breathing on him-- puts him at risk .
can everyone please step away from the boy ?

braden told me he was fine .
mom ...
is link gonna die ?
i @-@ i hope not .
but he &apos;s really sick .
he &apos;s even worse than ivy was ,
and you remember how bad she was ?
what ?
i have some good news .
it was a no . it was a hard no .
and then i realized that frankie was right .
you are a big @-@ time doctor .
so i told them that you were about to win a harper avery .
they placed the cardiac pumps in 10 sheep hearts ,
and 9 out of the 10 worked without clotting .
it &apos;s brilliant .
they put me on hold and then came back a few minutes later
and said okay .
just like that -- boom . suddenly , you have clout .
suddenly , you can get things done .
using the sheep was perfect .
their hearts are about the same size as link &apos;s .
parents signed consent .
they put the device on the next plane .
i got wilson coordinating with the airlines .
how the hell did you talk the fda into doing that ?
you &apos;re not gonna believe this .
okay . it was a no . it was a hard no . and then --
quiet ! please !
i &apos;ve got about four hours to get through all their research .
can you please take the party outside ?
san francisco &apos;s fogged in .
they &apos;ve grounded all commercial flights
for at least another couple of hours .
well , he &apos;s getting worse .
i don &apos;t think that he has that kind of time .
let &apos;s go .
ross will transport the kidney once i take it out ,
and then you &apos;ll join me for the transfer .
roger that .
you okay , ross ? you got this ?
ross !
swap monkey . you can have your conduits back .
i &apos;m good .
no . hey , unh @-@ unh ! i called swap monkey .
don &apos;t you go into that o.r. don &apos;t you dare !
too late !
damn it , ross .
hi .
i was --
never mind .
w @-@ what &apos;s a swap monkey ?
it &apos;s when you want what someone else has .
san jose airport &apos;s open .
there &apos;s a flight that connects through portland .
it can be here in six hours .
that &apos;s still too long .
i &apos;m telling you , private charter is the only way this will work .
yeah , richie rich , you said that .
i got one ! a @-@ a private jet .
it &apos;s fueled and ready and on the tarmac or whatever .
okay ! okay ! get it ! get it , get it , get it !
yes , very interested . what would --
it &apos;s $ 25,000 .
so , who pays for that ?
no , we need board approval for that one .
you &apos;re the board !
well , you call an emergency board meeting
because we have to !
come on !
we got to do it !
just use this , okay ?
put it on my card .
i &apos;ll sort it out with the board later . it &apos;s fine .
thank you , jackson .
yeah , thanks .
okay , amex .
3768 ...
it was the night that u @-@ dub made it into the finals .
this poor freshman fell
when blocking a three @-@ pointer .
it was such a freak injury .
the tibia was shattered in two places ,
the bone was sticking out like 6 inches from the skin .
it was totally disgusting .
but i assisted the attending in the o.r. ,
placing the rod and the screws .
it probably took like seven hours .
i fell in love .
it was ortho all the way .
yeah , look , callie , i know you don &apos;t want to hear this , but --
oh , come on ! nothing ?
a lot of people are depressed .
i &apos;m a happy person !
i have a number for you . this guy &apos;s great .
he helped me through a really difficult time .
my life is perfect .
i @-@ i &apos;m married to an amazing woman .
we &apos;re raising an adorable little girl .
i &apos;m at the forefront of groundbreaking medical technology
with robotic limbs .
not to mention , i &apos;m a homeowner .
i mean , do any of these things sound depressing to you ?
maybe your stupid fancy machine &apos;s broken .
i got thrown off my surgery ,
so bailey and i decided to come visit daddy .
hi .
i think you have a crush on my wife .
meredith walked in ,
and your pleasure center just lit up .
it &apos;s still lit .
nope .
it &apos;s not meredith .
i didn &apos;t see you
at the champagne toast this morning for yang .
i had rounds .
jealous ?
of yang ?
don &apos;t let it eat at you .
vascular clamp .
when ellis won , it ate at me .
didn &apos;t make me a better surgeon .
made me a jealous one .
i &apos;m not jealous !
okay , i &apos;m jealous .
happy now ? therapy &apos;s over .
not enough length on the right renal vein .
we &apos;ll need to mobilize it .
bailey , you have your genome lab work .
the things you could do , the lives you can save --
that &apos;s award @-@ winning .
do they give awards to people who are stuck ?
that poor boy spends the rest of his life in a bubble
if i can &apos;t figure out how to fix his mutation ,
and i &apos;ve been staring at the research for weeks .
anastomosing the external iliac , 5 @-@ 0 prolene .
out of the way !
medevac with the device just touched down on the roof .
what &apos;d i miss ?
yang &apos;s going over the procedure in her head .
she &apos;s so cool . she &apos;s amazing .
she &apos;s totally gonna win the harper avery .
and we know her .
i printed one of her sample conduits .
for the rest of my life , i get to say that .
what &apos;s she doing ? - being amazing . she &apos;s poetry --
meredith , can you turn off the intercom ?
the kidney &apos;s pinking up . that &apos;s just beautiful .
what do you mean , &quot; enh &quot; ?
we just transplanted an hiv @-@ positive organ ,
and you &apos;re making a mopey face ?
i remember when hiv baffled us --
i mean , the way it could make its way into cells ,
replicate its dna ,
i mean , the perfectly designed virus .
i understand how hiv works .
we never thought we &apos;d find anything close to a cure .
and now look at keith .
he &apos;s alive .
he &apos;s full of t @-@ cells .
he just received a kidney transplant -- from us .
we do this marvelous thing , i &apos;m trying to enjoy it ,
and you &apos;re bringing me down .
i understand how hiv works .
yeah , you just said that .
let &apos;s just close the patient .
i need to be around some sunshine , not rain clouds .
no , no . it &apos;s a perfectly designed virus .
hiv has a brilliant transport system --
the mechanisms it uses , it ...
if i could deactivate it ...
okay , i need to read
everything on gene therapy and virus vectors .
i need stem cells . i @-@ i need to get down to my lab .
oh ! i need a mocha latte !
okay , well , go . i &apos;ll close up . go .
go now ! okay . oh !
what &apos;d i miss ?
the pow .
i &apos;m gonna start here ,
uh , to leave a rim of ventricle to sew the pump to .
good idea .
hey , have you googled any of the other nominees ?
no .
i have .
you want to know what i think ?
no .
excuse me . sorry . pardon me . excuse me , sir .
no one would even know
that you &apos;re seething with jealousy right now .
i &apos;m not seething . i am happy for her .
right . i have a machine that will confirm seething .
i wore waterproof mascara today because i was sure
i wouldn &apos;t make it through the day without crying .
and if anybody saw me , i would say
that i was crying because i &apos;m happy for her .
and they would believe me because ...
does a jealous friend plan a champagne toast ?
you planned a champagne toast to cover up your jealousy ?
you &apos;re a genius .
you should call the harper avery people .
tell them . maybe they &apos;ll give me an award .
i just strapped the camera to the top ,
and check this out .
you can see where you &apos;re going on your tablet ,
and you can talk to anyone .
look , i know it &apos;s not what you wanted .
it &apos;s awesome ! how far does it go ?
200 yards . that &apos;ll cover the whole peds floor .
you can visit your girlfriend .
she &apos;s not my girlfriend !
um , yang &apos;s done . surgery was a success .
oh . cool .
did you make that ?
well , it &apos;s a $ 10 solution .
i think it &apos;s great .
well , money lets you do good crap in the world .
oh , my god .
you called butthole .
yeah . well , i told him i was interested .
yang ?
congratulations on the harper avery .
just a nomination .
cristina yang !
i taught you better than that .
when someone congratulates you ,
you look them in the eye and smile and say &quot; thank you . &quot;
thank you , dr. bailey .
you &apos;re welcome , dr. yang .
kidney function is excellent . urine output is good .
well , that &apos;s some history @-@ making urine .
swap monkey , shane .
i think i &apos;ll go back down to dr. bailey &apos;s genome lab .
oh , now you want in .
she &apos;s mine .
no . you go deal with your conduits .
ross !
oh , dr. webber , i &apos;m looking for a picture of ellis grey
with her first , uh , harper avery .
do you remember what year it was ?
1988 .
hey , you want to see ?
she looks so happy .
she was happy .
that was a great night .
it was a great night .
so far , there &apos;s no evidence of clotting ,
and his pump is working well .
he &apos;s doing really great .
we &apos;re gonna keep him sedated for about 24 hours
and then slowly wake him up .
thank you all so much .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry that we doubted you .
we shouldn &apos;t have .
doubt is normal .
get some rest .
i have clean underwear ?
i &apos;m gonna cry . you &apos;re making me cry .
don &apos;t be surprised when you see a charge
for , like , $ 25,000 on the credit card .
what ?
yeah , you know how earlier i said
i don &apos;t spend my money on hookers and private planes ?
i guess , like , technically , i was lying .
you spent $ 25,000 on --
on an airplane , okay ?
for cristina &apos;s experimental heart to get here .
and the board is gonna reimburse me .
who even has a credit limit that high ?
turns out i do .
i @-@ i feel a little sick .
your credit limit
and trust fund and $ 4 lattes
are -- are literally just making me feel sick .
eat some three @-@ day @-@ old lasagna .
that &apos;ll make you feel better .
i didn &apos;t know that you were waiting .
you &apos;re gonna kill me .
why ?
you are .
oh , my god . i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m even ...
did you sleep with someone else ?
what ? no !
oh . thank god . you scared me .
i want another baby .
what ?
look , i want my life back , too ,
and i want time to have a thought and do my work .
but i also --
wait -- why on earth would you think
i would sleep with someone else ?
because you said that i was gonna kill you .
after everything that we &apos;ve been through ,
how you could ever , even for one second ,
think that i would sleep with someone else is crazy .
i want another baby , too .
what ?
i don &apos;t want sofia to bury us alone
or nurse us through some horrible , long decline by herself .
she should go through that with someone else .
that &apos;s morbid and awful .
or practical .
and awful .
well , you want another baby , too .
yeah , because i love babies .
they &apos;re adorable and delicious .
and you just realized that this afternoon ?
yeah , i forgot . and then i saw meredith and her baby , and --
wait . why are we arguing ?
we &apos;re gonna have another baby .
we are .
i love you so much .
i love you so , so much .
oh ! we &apos;re gonna have another baby !
my mom didn &apos;t think she &apos;d win .
she thought it was a popularity contest ,
and she wasn &apos;t popular .
she was a woman and a fellow ,
and her arrogance could rub people the wrong way .
she hadn &apos;t allowed herself to imagine
the possibility of winning
because she wanted it too much .
you know , i have looked at the other nominees .
i &apos;ve seen their research .
me too .
what ? really ?
yes , i looked at everyone &apos;s abstracts
and read their articles .
i even called a friend over at , uh , chicago children &apos;s
who knows lucas -- you know , whatever his name is --
who &apos;s doing the work on the ligature tissue @-@ sealing device ,
which is ... kinda ...
derivative .
right ? right ?
and supposedly , his trial patients are not doing well .
which is bad , obviously , but also --
i think you &apos;re gonna win .
and when they called my mom &apos;s name ,
she was genuinely shocked .
it was validation of all her hard work and sacrifice .
i really do .
i think you are going to win .
me too .
she came home and told me
she didn &apos;t win the harper avery .
