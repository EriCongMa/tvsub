yeah , why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
just wanna make sure .
it &apos;s mexico .
well , it &apos;s a big country , jack .
yes , it is , it &apos;s a big country
i know you &apos;ve been deliberately avoiding since brad &apos;s death .
look , i appreciate your concern .
i really do .
but , now , i &apos;m back in the irt
and , the fact of the matter is
i was bound to face this situation , sooner or later .
you know we have your back , always ?
mm , that &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna be all right .
hola , mis amigos .
here &apos;s news from south of the border ,
down mexico way .
jessica wolf , age 36,
a graphic designer from fort worth , texas ,
is on vacation with her husband , daniel ,
a management consultant ; and their two kids :
ryan , 11 ; and megan , 9 .
they &apos;re staying at a beachfront villa
at the las casitas del pacifico resort .
at 4 : 12 am local time ,
daniel reported his wife , jessica , missing .
there were indications of violence ,
and $ 4,000 worth of jewelry was stolen , however ,
a canvass of the resort &apos;s property
turned up nothing .
then , at 11 : 47 am ,
a body washed ashore at cobra cove ,
about 5 miles south of las casitas .
jessica wolf was a u.s. citizen murdered on mexican soil ,
so , our consulate general in juarez
has requested the irt &apos;s help
with the impending homicide investigation .
which won &apos;t be made any easier by the fact that
puerta del santos does not have a police force .
usually , resorts like las casitas
enlist the service of a private security firm .
in this case , it &apos;s a u.s. based company
called pln international .
they secured the villa and the beach site
until the mexican federal police arrived
and they are on the scene now .
we can &apos;t tell much from these photos ,
but the sheets that are wrapped around jessica &apos;s body
look like a crude forensic countermeasure ,
a way to spirit a body off the grounds
without raising much suspicion .
well , if $ 4,000 in jewelry was taken ,
then , burglary could &apos;ve been a primary motive .
jessica &apos;s murder could &apos;ve been an impulsive act .
yeah , but don &apos;t you think breaking into a hotel villa
in the middle of the night is a pretty provocative act ,
even for a desperate burglar ?
it &apos;s possible jessica was targeted .
what do you think ?
i &apos;d like to know
where daniel wolf was when all this went down .
where were his kids ?
what did they see and hear ?
i wish i could tell you , but ,
aside from his initial statement ,
daniel stopped cooperating with police
as soon as his children were taken
into protective custody as material witnesses .
our job now is to get down there and assist the mfp
while also protecting daniel &apos;s civil rights ,
regardless of his guilt or innocence .
not to rush to judgment , boss ,
but what i just dug up on this guy
is straight out of the shady @-@ husband playbook .
take a look .
a year ago , daniel &apos;s consulting firm filed for bankruptcy .
eight months later , jessica filed for divorce ,
and then she withdrew the filing a month later .
but here &apos;s the kicker : 30 days ago ,
daniel took out an insurance policy on his wife ,
so , now , this dude is line to collect --
wait for it --
$ 1 million . -
the fact is that the only way we &apos;re gonna know
if daniel wolf is playing the grieving husband
is by getting down there and talkin &apos; to him face @-@ to @-@ face .
well , what if he refuses to talk to us ?
what if he refuses to talk to the only people
who can protect his best interests , his civil rights ?
well , that &apos;ll tell us something about him , then , won &apos;t it ?
第一季 第七集
&quot; perfect order is the forerunner
to perfect horror . &quot;
carlos fuentes .
unit chief garrett .
i &apos;m consul general patrick hillis .
it &apos;s a pleasure to meet you .
this is mr. raymond wright . he &apos;s representing
daniel wolf and his family .
good to meet you . this is my team --
look , i &apos;m sorry , but , pleasantries aside ,
i &apos;m deeply concerned that every moment
the mfp is focused on my client as a suspect
is a moment wasted on finding the real killer .
mr. wright , please . the irt ...
can &apos;t change the fact that the crime scenes
have been compromised by hotel employees
and can &apos;t change the fact that expediency trumps justice
in the mexican legal system .
i thought it was my youth and inexperience
that was the problem .
just getting to that , miss ruiz .
that &apos;s chief inspector ruiz to you , señor wright .
to all of you .
unit chief garrett .
agents seger , simmons , and jarvis .
look , i won &apos;t lie to you .
i don &apos;t want you here .
this is my case and you being here complicates my life
and i don &apos;t like complications .
i like everything muy fácil .
but my bosses in the capital think that the fbi &apos;s cooperation
will help me , so , please , follow me .
ci ruiz , are you the only officer assigned to this case ?
see ? this is what i &apos;m talking about .
mr. wright , i understand your concern , but , right now ,
you need to be seen , not heard .
yes , i &apos;m the only mfp officer assigned to this case ,
but my bosses gave me permission
to deputize the las casitas security staff .
they &apos;re u.s. trained , so probably
a whole lot better than mfp , don &apos;t you think ?
so , how do you think somebody managed
to take jessica wolf off the property
without bein &apos; picked up on one of these security cameras ?
that &apos;s a good question .
jessica &apos;s killer knows the lay of the land .
and your client fits that description .
he needs to start answering my questions .
he &apos;ll answer questions when you let him see his children .
his children are material witnesses .
they &apos;re scared , so they haven &apos;t talked --
of course they &apos;re scared . they lost their mother
and their father &apos;s being kept from them .
hold on . i have a solution here .
agent seger has years of expertise
taking witness statements from minors .
she &apos;ll be able to put the children at ease
and get to the truth .
i also think daniel might be more comfortable talkin &apos; to me .
daniel will agree to that .
like i said ,
muy fácil .
one of you is a coroner , right ?
a medical examiner , yes .
we were going to transport the body to mexico city
for an autopsy . could you do it here ?
they don &apos;t just bring me along
for my good taste and my sense of humor .
i &apos;d like agent simmons to walk through the villa crime scene .
i have no problem with that , as long as i get to chaperone .
okay .
let &apos;s go to work .
so you &apos;re with the fbi ?
yes . i &apos;m here to help , daniel .
they found jessica . they won &apos;t let me see her .
won &apos;t even let me see my own kids .
what the hell &apos;s wrong with these people ?
i know this is difficult , but the best way
to help yourself and your family is
to just talk to me .
where were you last night ?
jessica wasn &apos;t feeling well .
she wanted to stay in the villa
while i took the kids souvenir hunting .
we got back late , after midnight .
kids crashed on the couch .
i didn &apos;t want to disturb jessica , so ,
i went to the den , fell asleep .
i woke up at 4 : 00 .
i checked on her .
and that &apos;s --
that &apos;s when i found the blood
and jewelry box tossed on the floor .
i @-@ i called for help .
nobody told me there &apos;s no police in this damn town
and that it &apos;d take an hour for them to get here .
all that wasted time .
did you account for every guard
who was present at this scene ?
did you take their prints as exemplars ?
like i said , all well @-@ trained in the u.s.
they know how to fill out the correct incident reports .
well , they don &apos;t know how to preserve a crime scene
or collect evidence .
you know , as well as i do this scene is compromised .
agent simmons , you know , as well as i do
your rules of evidence aren &apos;t the same as mine .
besides , saved the best for last .
well , that looks like
at least 2 liters of blood .
maybe 3 .
a lethal loss of blood .
jessica wasn &apos;t just assaulted here .
she died in this room and someone tried ,
not so good , to cover it up ,
make it look like a burglary gone wrong .
may i look at your cellphone ?
what ?
your cellphone . may i see it ?
why ?
well , it may have digital information on it
that could support your alibi .
i @-@ i lost it .
somewhere out there , on the beach ,
during the search .
look .
i &apos;m here to help you , daniel .
but i know your consulting firm went bankrupt ,
i know jessica filed for divorce ,
and i know she &apos;s now worth
a million dollars , now that she &apos;s dead ,
so i need you to tell me the truth .
i didn &apos;t kill my wife .
houston , we have a problem .
in prepping the body for autopsy ,
somebody was kind enough
to remove those sheets that were wrapped around her body .
they shouldn &apos;t have done that .
note to file : must find missing evidence .
all right , jess .
help me help you .
victim sustained several defensive wounds
during the attack ,
including a severe incised wound
to the palmar surface of both hands ,
indicating that she grasped the blade of the weapon
during the attack .
she fought .
cause of death is exsanguination ,
due to a single sharp @-@ force injury ,
severing the ascending aorta .
the remaining 46 penetrating sharp @-@ force injuries
were administered postmortem ,
indicative of the assailant &apos;s acute aggression ,
usually referred to as overkill
and typically a sign that the attack was personal .
ryan , megan , you don &apos;t have to
talk to me , or anyone .
i just wanna make sure you &apos;re safe .
you guys hungry ?
do me a favor and order me a pizza .
yes , ma &apos;am .
so , food is on the way .
okay ?
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
you need anything else , you let me know , all right ?
did daddy hurt mommy ?
why would you ask that ?
mom and dad , they just yelled .
a lot .
just on this trip ,
or were they fighting before that ?
for a long time , but , we hoped this trip
would make it better .
it wasn &apos;t .
it was just weird that
they were pretending like nothing was going on and ...
like we didn &apos;t know something was going on .
it was so stupid .
did you ever see your father be rough with your mother ?
you think you can tell me
what you remember from last night ?
i don &apos;t remember much , just ...
dad woke us up .
mom wasn &apos;t there .
what about you , ryan ?
i @-@ i remember
my father .
daniel . daniel .
standing over me . it was weird and --
and i fell asleep again , and , like meg said ,
dad woke us up .
mom was gone .
okay .
look , this is me , trying very hard
to extend professional courtesy
to fellow law enforcement ,
but i &apos;m not here
to ask for permission to arrest daniel wolf .
well , thank you for your courtesy , ci ruiz .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;ve had the chance to speak with daniel
and compare notes with my team
and there are a few psychological inconsistencies here .
is that right ?
take daniel &apos;s expression of love for his children .
it &apos;s genuine . it &apos;s very telling .
his behavior totally contradicts my all @-@ in theory .
all @-@ in theory ?
patriarchs who murder their wives with their own children present
usually feel compelled to go all @-@ in ,
killing the whole family , including themselves .
patriarchs perceive it as an act of love and mercy .
that didn &apos;t happen here . why ?
hijos de la fregada .
how can you look at evidence right in front of your face
and not even see it ? !
with all due respect ,
the evidence in this case is circumstantial .
it &apos;s how you &apos;re choosing to contextualize it
that makes it appear beyond a reasonable doubt .
it &apos;s kind of like hearing hoofbeats
and thinking horses , not zebras .
with all due respect ,
we don &apos;t get a lot of zebras around here .
you seriously don &apos;t think this man murdered his wife ?
i don &apos;t think he stabbed her to death , no .
but i think he might know who did .
you said you lost your phone .
ray , you need to get my kids back
from the cops , right now .
there &apos;s nothin &apos; i can do . you know that .
you bring them here and then , we &apos;re getting out of town .
i will not get railroaded into spending
the rest of my life in a mexican prison .
dan , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
the fbi is gonna clear you .
you &apos;ve got nothin &apos; to worry about , right ?
get my damn kids back , ray .
look , i &apos;ve gotta go . i &apos;ll be back .
y dóned está ? pues encuéntralo .
daniel just took off .
and we lost him .
what do you say now , agent garrett ?
i said daniel didn &apos;t stab his wife .
but he might have just reached out to the person who did .
monty , we got eyes on daniel ?
as you predicted , he reached out to his partner in crime .
here &apos;s a fun fact for you --
daniel &apos;s cellphone business plan has four phones ,
two of which -- thank you , gps --
are now moving together hand in hand .
we &apos;re on our way .
monty , i need to know where we &apos;re headed .
they seem to have gotten a room at the rancho sierra inn .
ci ruiz ,
suspects are located at the rancho sierra inn .
we will follow your tactical lead .
copy that .
can you pinpoint a location ?
uh , they &apos;re like 75 feet due east .
mae and i will cover the back .
get back in . get down .
don &apos;t ! don &apos;t ! wait ! don &apos;t shoot !
i surrender ! i surrender .
daniel , you okay ?
looks like she clocked you pretty good .
oh , yeah . my head .
stand up .
good .
&apos;cause you &apos;re under arrest .
since puerto del santos doesn &apos;t have a police force ,
it also doesn &apos;t have a jail .
so , in order to look after our new prisoners
we &apos;ve had to make
some special arrangements nearby .
playa diablo penitentiary .
they say that even the devil himself
would prefer death over diablo .
laura hayes , fort worth , texas .
this says you &apos;re a promotions manager .
is that right ?
you ready to talk to us , laura ?
what were you thinking ,
taking off and leaving your children ?
i wasn &apos;t leaving my children .
i &apos;d never abandon them .
they &apos;re all i have left in this world .
let &apos;s talk about you and daniel .
how long were you guys having an affair ?
two years , i guess .
but i swear , at the time when we started ,
i didn &apos;t know he was married .
i wish i could go back and make a different choice .
at the time , i @-@ i felt like i needed more ,
like i deserved more .
but you did find out he was married eventually , right ?
i did .
his wife , she found out about us around that same time , too .
she filed for divorce .
i begged her to reconsider ,
if not for us , for the sake of the children .
i told her i &apos;d break it off , and i did .
he comes to me and he says he needs to fight for his family .
all the promises ,
all the plans we made , just gone ,
thrown away like garbage .
i shouldn &apos;t have lied to you before .
i @-@ i wasn &apos;t thinking straight .
i thought i could talk to laura , convince her to --
convince her to do what , daniel ?
to tell the truth .
laura killed my wife .
the car that you were driving
was a rental car you picked up in fort worth .
so you drove 1,500 miles to do what exactly ?
i don &apos;t know . i wanted to come down here and blow up his life
like he had mine .
phone records say you were still in touch with laura
and that you gave her one of your phones .
i was still juggling .
i was hoping this trip would fix everything .
then jessica found out that laura was calling me .
what she didn &apos;t know is that
laura had followed us all the way down here .
got a motel room ,
called dan a few times ,
and then , around midnight , i called one more time .
you &apos;re gonna meet me .
you &apos;re gonna meet me at the boardwalk in an hour .
i &apos;m headed over there , okay ?
and i threatened him ,
told him i &apos;d come over if he didn &apos;t come see me .
she wanted to meet me at the boardwalk .
i didn &apos;t have a choice . i had to go .
and when i hung up the phone ,
i caught my reflection in the mirror ,
and i didn &apos;t even recognize myself .
i mean , how did i become this crazy stalker ?
i felt so much guilt and shame .
wasn &apos;t even like i decided not to see him .
i just passed out .
laura never showed up . i called her .
never heard anything , so i went back to the villa .
what time was that ?
quarter after 2 : 00 in the morning .
and you didn &apos;t think to check on jessica at the time ?
i did . i checked the bedroom .
the door was locked . i figured she was pissed at me .
i got up at 4 : 00 a.m. to check again .
this time , the door was unlocked ,
and jessica was gone .
i might have been jealous of that woman ,
but i didn &apos;t kill her .
i swear i didn &apos;t kill my wife .
but if you &apos;re asking me if i think he did it ,
i will you tell you without hesitation that , daniel ,
he &apos;s capable of anything that helps daniel .
laura knew exactly how this would look .
she &apos;s been hell @-@ bent on punishing me
for what i did to her .
and i don &apos;t know . maybe i deserve it .
but megan and ryan , they don &apos;t deserve any of this .
none of it .
what do you see here , jack ?
well , i &apos;ll tell you what i don &apos;t see .
i don &apos;t see daniel stabbing his wife to death
with his children only a few feet away .
early in my career , i learned to see the scene
as the killer does --
at the same hour , under the same conditions .
and this doesn &apos;t add up .
so you don &apos;t think he &apos;s lying now ?
i think his lies , at first ,
were meant to cover up his affair with laura .
then they continued , out of his sincere belief
that she &apos;d become the scorned woman avenging her broken heart
by killing his wife and framing him for the murder .
that may be what he believes ,
but that &apos;s not what happened .
even though her patterns suggest an obsessive love disorder ,
her passions tend towards deliberate self @-@ harm
rather than externalized rage .
plus , if she &apos;s not working with daniel ,
she just wouldn &apos;t be capable of wrapping up jessica on her own ,
carrying her off the property , then dumping her in the ocean .
what about that insurance policy ?
monty &apos;s initial information came from the company
that issued that policy ,
but daniel &apos;s lawyer got me in touch
with the wolfs &apos; estate planner .
it was jessica &apos;s idea to purchase that policy .
and that , my friends , is the sound
of motive leaving the building .
we &apos;ve been looking at this whole thing the wrong way
from the beginning .
okay , so back to square one .
who killed jessica wolf and why ?
but now we have two innocent americans falsely accused
and imprisoned for that crime ,
and we &apos;ve got to get them out of there .
you want me to release them ?
i &apos;d like you to release them into our custody ,
pending the outcome of the investigation .
investigation &apos;s over . we got &apos; em .
they didn &apos;t kill jessica wolf .
how can you say that ?
because you looked into their eyes and saw their souls ?
everything that &apos;s done or left at a crime scene
isn &apos;t just a piece of evidence .
it &apos;s a piece of the offender himself .
my team &apos;s job is to put those pieces together ,
create a profile of that person .
yeah , in this case ,
that profile does not fit laura hayes or daniel wolf .
your profile or wishful thinking ?
because i also know it &apos;s your job to protect americans .
look , we &apos;re the ones extending professional courtesy now .
we can have the same conversation
with your superiors in mexico city .
we could .
but even if they agreed with you ,
it &apos;s out of their hands .
the state prosecutor will now decide the fate
of daniel wolf and his mistress .
there has to be at least some way to transfer them
out of playa diablo .
no .
in fact , in 24 hours ,
they &apos;ll be let into general population .
that &apos;s like handing them a death sentence .
they say the punishment fits the crime , agent garrett .
but if you want to break them out of jail , all you have to do
is bring the prosecutor the real killer .
restarting this investigation
without the mfp &apos;s cooperation if gonna be chanllenging ,
but , mae , you say you have something .
yeah . so i &apos;ve been trying to track down those sheets
that were wrapped around the body .
i assumed that they were bed sheets
that were taken from the villa .
they weren &apos;t ?
no . a fancy place like this keeps really tidy records ,
and all sheets and other sort of linens are accounted for ,
which means that the killer brought the sheets with him .
okay , so where are we
on trace analysis from jessica &apos;s body ?
i can head back to the plane
and check on the presumptive reports .
go now .
i need eyes in that prison just in case the clock runs out .
i agree . i &apos;ll see what i can do .
that silhouette that ryan thought
was his father standing over him ,
do you think it &apos;s possible he saw
something more than he remembers ?
i &apos;m not sure .
i need you to perform a cognitive interview with him .
jack , what if ryan doesn &apos;t remember
because he suppressed that memory ?
if we open that wound -- - we don &apos;t have a choice .
i know it &apos;s terrible ,
but we need to do ? everything we can right now
to make sure that he and his sister
don &apos;t lose their father , too .
now , i want you to feel yourself floating backwards
and feel yourself lying on the couch .
my skin keeps sticking to it .
it &apos;s warm .
air conditioner is off .
and the air , ? what does it smell like ?
seaweed .
f @-@ fish and chicken from the barbecue .
i want you to feel yourself
as you were drifting in and out of sleep ,
your eyes open .
what do you see ?
i see my dad standing over me .
i need you to take a closer look .
can you see his face ?
no , i can &apos;t , but i hear him .
what do you hear ?
he &apos;s whispering .
he &apos;s holding a cross on a chain .
why is he holding a cross ?
a cross ?
like two ice cream sticks crossed together ,
tied with gold .
and i hear my mom crying .
i got to go to sleep .
i got to go back to sleep .
that &apos;s the man .
that &apos;s the man who killed my mom .
i should &apos;ve woken up . i could &apos;ve saved her .
you need to let me go !
no , no . no .
let me go !
stop . look in my eyes .
this is not your fault .
there is nothing you could &apos;ve done .
‭ nothing . okay ?
do you understand ?
i &apos;m so scared .
come here . it &apos;s okay .
look . you are safe .
no one is gonna hurt you . okay ?
hey , clara .
um , listen , you didn &apos;t happen to find
any residue of protein filaments on the body , did you ?
mm , no . why ?
i &apos;m working on a theory .
what about any hemp fibers or mineral oils ?
it &apos;s like you &apos;re reading my preliminary trace report .
i &apos;ll be right over .
you and monty and the art skills .
monty is the artist . i just doodle .
but these particular doodles
suggest something peculiar to me .
and if i &apos;m right , what ryan saw in the killer &apos;s hand
was a crude latin blasphemy of the true cross .
true cross -- what people refer to
as the physical remnants of the cross
that jesus was crucified on .
exactly .
and in this theological context ,
i was thinking about how the killer wrapped the body .
what if he didn &apos;t do it as a forensic countermeasure ?
what if he did it because he was actually trying
to mimic an old judeo @-@ christian burial custom ?
you mean prepping the body with oil
then shrouding it with cloth ?
well , if that &apos;s true , then we &apos;re not just talking
about someone with remorse .
we &apos;re talking about someone --
someone with a signature .
and i think this someone is caught
between frenzied aggression ,
the multiple stab wounds ,
and a more serene , contemplative ritual
of preparing a body for burial .
yeah . but what we &apos;re actually talking about
is burial in the ground rituals ,
not dumped at sea like jessica was .
yeah .
well , there &apos;s still a lot to fill in .
but if we are right ,
this isn &apos;t this unsub &apos;s first rodeo .
okay , well , i think that we should see
what monty can dig up .
so i cross @-@ referenced our m.o.s , and i got something --
five more homicides taking place
across these latin @-@ american resorts
all over the last five years --
all tourist families , all taking place on the same day .
well , these victims were male , teens and adolescents ,
the family &apos;s oldest male children .
jessica wasn &apos;t the unsub &apos;s target .
uh , excuse me ?
that is what all of this means to the unsub .
wait . our unsub &apos;s obsessed with mexico &apos;s april fools &apos; day ?
today , día de los incocentes is an excuse to pull pranks .
but it began hundreds of years ago
as a feast day in remembrance
of the biblical massacre of the innocents by king herod .
herod ordered the execution of all male children under 2
in the vicinity of bethlehem
so as to avoid loss of his throne
to the coming messiah .
but if you &apos;re right ,
he &apos;s mixing up biblical traditions here --
the innocents and passover .
and adapting his own narrative line .
which is ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i do know that jessica was murdered
because she walked in on the unsub
as he was about to attack her son , ryan .
daniel . daniel .
all those defensive wounds .
jessica fought as hard as she could
to protect her children .
ryan and these five other boys are surrogates
for whatever our unsub &apos;s twisted fantasy is .
right , but if ryan was the real target here ,
then why didn &apos;t the unsub go after him
after he finished with jessica ?
because daniel came back .
he interrupted him again .
and he was already out of his comfort zone ,
having killed jessica .
the only thing left to do was clean up his tracks ,
confuse the crime scene .
okay . so let &apos;s draw it up .
our unsub is undoubtedly male .
given his technical proficiency and historical knowledge ,
he is most likely in his 30s or 40s .
highly educated , and yet , due to socialization issues ,
he &apos;s most likely a dropout
or someone who was expelled from college ,
maybe even a seminary or church .
he is both motivated and repelled by his concept of sin ,
which somehow correlates to his chosen surrogates
and suggests that he &apos;s a grief @-@ induced ,
anger @-@ retaliatory narcissist .
you know , if this guy really thinks
that he &apos;s some latter @-@ day king herod massacring messiahs ,
then maybe he &apos;s retaliating against god himself .
which could mean our unsub &apos;s trigger
was some kind of act of god ,
maybe even one that took the life of a loved one .
monty , go back to just prior to the first murder .
identify any natural disasters in the region
that could fit our profile .
i &apos;ve got something on our act @-@ of @-@ god search .
take a look .
the true faith church .
part of it collapsed during an earthquake 6 years ago .
the head pastor &apos;s son , matthew , died .
he was only 12 years old .
yeah . matthew &apos;s father is rafael acosta .
he &apos;s got a record .
about 6 months after his son died ,
he was arrested at mazatlan
for assaulting a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy .
this guy can &apos;t still be the pastor there , can he ?
i wouldn &apos;t think so , but i &apos;m not finding a great deal
of information online about the church &apos;s current staff .
well , if this rafael acosta &apos;s our guy ,
doesn &apos;t make any sense that his victims
would be surrogates for his dead son .
all right , so who do the victims represent ?
guess we &apos;ll just have to ask rafael acosta himself .
let &apos;s start with this church .
i actually have two locations of interest for you .
one is the church itself .
the other is a condemned property
that the church also owns ,
about 15 miles northwest of las casitas resort .
divide and conquer .
simmons and mae , you take the church .
clara and i will check out this condemned property .
let &apos;s go .
hello .
hola .
qué tal ?
hola .
gracias , but i do speak english .
i &apos;m reverend esteban soria .
how can i be of service to the fbi ?
we &apos;re looking for one of your pastors --
rafael acosta .
he hasn &apos;t been with us for a few years now .
we understand that he lost his son here
during an earthquake .
yes . a terrible tragedy .
but yet , strangely coupled with a miracle .
miracle ? what do you mean ?
there were two boys in the sanctuary
that day that it collapsed --
matthew and this boy , uh , bryant .
he and his parents were visitors from the u.s. just like you .
when we dug through the rubble , we pulled him out ,
and he was still alive .
do you recall how rafael responded to this miracle ?
he was never the same after that day .
he was always unusually fierce in his expression of faith ,
some thought too fierce .
do you remember his last name , bryant &apos;s ?
ah , i believe it was bryant holt .
do you have any idea where
we might be able to find rafael now ?
no , i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t .
glacias .
local media down baja way is still pretty analog ,
but i found this in a ballard , utah , paper .
the victims are all surrogates
for this miracle boy , bryant holt .
yeah , rafael acosta is avenging himself
by massacring this innocent over and over .
and we still need to find him .
it &apos;s clear .
he was definitely here recently .
$ 4,000 worth of jewelry really did mean nothing to him .
that was just a way to throw us off .
he had no way to know
how much the wolf family drama would do that .
so where does he go from here ?
you know , i keep trying to wrap my head
around this unsub &apos;s patience ,
his devotion to the annual cycle .
how does he sustain himself over 365 days
in between sacrificial killings ?
maybe he &apos;s like dennis rader .
right . the btk killer .
rader was able to soothe his killing urges
by becoming a compliance agent .
maybe our unsub pacified his urges
by working a job with strict responsibilities ,
like a civil servant or a code enforcer .
security guard .
ya . glacias .
i &apos;m sorry this hasn &apos;t been easy for you ,
but this gentleman &apos;s gonna drive you to the airport
so you can get on a plane and go back home .
i know how much your grandparents miss you .
where &apos;s agent clara ?
look at that . speak of the devil .
fbi .
agent garrett , i was starting to miss you .
yeah , i can hold the children .
stop ! aah !
stop ! let her go !
what are you doing ? stop ! stop !
stop !
don &apos;t do it ! stop !
all right . he &apos;s got ryan . he &apos;s got a knife .
he knows we &apos;re here , jack . be careful .
mea culpa .
rafael ?
we know what happened to your son .
we know what happened to matthew .
we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
you know nothing .
god took my son . i take his .
an eye for an eye .
rafael , no .
god took my husband .
rafael , i know exactly what it feels like
to be angry with god .
my husband , brad , he was --
he was the love of my life ,
and god ripped him away from me .
afterwards , i was
just consumed with rage .
i was his most faithful servant .
why take my matthew ?
i asked myself the exact same question when i lost brad .
all of that pain , it is ...
it is overwhelming , isn &apos;t it ?
it burns .
and that &apos;s why you felt the need
to take the lives of those boys
because each time you took one from this world ,
you thought that it would stop that pain .
but it didn &apos;t , did it ?
all of these acts of vengeance ,
they do nothing to quell the agony of matthew &apos;s death .
it &apos;s not fair .
matthew was innocent .
yes .
yes , he was ,
just like ryan , just like that little boy
that you are holding in your arms right now .
no . he &apos;s been chosen .
rafael , i want you to listen to me .
remember what it says in proverbs --
&quot; let not mercy and truth forsake thee .
bind them upon thy neck .
write them on the table with your heart . &quot;
rafael , do you know why god writes his words in your heart ?
so that when your heart breaks ,
his words , they fall in .
i &apos;m forsaken .
it &apos;s over , rafael . put your hands on your head .
dad .
dad .
oh , my babies . my babies , i missed you .
you &apos;re a lucky man , daniel .
not too many people get a second chance ,
a shot at redemption .
i &apos;m not sure i deserve it ,
but maybe i got it because of my kids .
you did great work today .
thank you .
but --
but what ?
and i thought brad had a bad poker face .
yours is so much worse .
is that right ?
yeah .
you cut open ? a pretty deep scar today
in order to talk down rafael acosta .
oh , believe me , i didn &apos;t want to .
but there &apos;s nothing else i could have done .
you gonna be all right ?
you know , when brad died ,
it dawned on me for the very first time
why every orthodox faith on this planet
has these strict timelines and rituals
for how you &apos;re supposed to mourn the dead
and move on with the living .
you violate those customs , you dishonor the dead .
as well as the living .
there has to be a time to grieve .
and a time to move on .
i &apos;m really glad you &apos;re back .
me , too .
so let &apos;s go home .
