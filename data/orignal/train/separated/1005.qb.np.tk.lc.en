to our best and final score .
what is it ?
part of the original
german u @-@ boat manifest .
you still think caffrey has the art ?
i don &apos;t know .
whoever stole it ,
if a single item on this list
shows up anywhere -- - we got &apos; em .
yeah . we got &apos; em .
did you find the safe ?
the manifest wasn &apos;t in there , moz . i &apos;m sorry .
oh , come on , sara , you &apos;ve always known who i am .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
i guess you figured out everything i have to offer .
caffrey , please take care of yourself .
van dyck -- &quot; portrait of a boy . &quot;
where are you ?
there it is .
degas -- &quot; masked dancers . &quot;
oh , come on .
moz , thank god you didn &apos;t sell it .
they know about the treasure .
they &apos;re on to us .
what are you talking about ? what happened ?
ghost ship found with hitler clones and priceless art .
&quot; ghost ship found with hitler clones &quot; ?
&quot; and priceless art . &quot;
our priceless art .
they &apos;re also on to a vegan vampire
ravaging community gardens .
look , there &apos;s no need to hit the panic button .
neal , this is where our treasure has reached
what malcolm gladwell would call a &quot; tipping point . &quot;
forensics doesn &apos;t talk , nor does peter .
yeah , but the suit and his suit cohorts
brought in d.c. art crimes , one of whom
was willing to spill the nazi beans in a hotel bar .
she thought i was interpol .
my point exactly .
i get it , moz . secrets can &apos;t be kept forever .
but no one can trace this to us .
except hale , who i &apos;ve already lined up to fence the degas .
oh , and sara ,
the half @-@ suit who suddenly broke things off .
i &apos;m gonna see her today . i &apos;ll find out what she knows .
skip it . let &apos;s just go .
vámonos .
we don &apos;t have the means .
we will if we sell the degas .
no . that is too high @-@ profile .
the fbi only has a partial list .
the odds are miniscule that the degas is even on it .
but if it is and we sell it --
we &apos;ll be long gone
before anyone can say &quot; degas away with it . &quot;
and wherever we go , i am telling you ,
the fbi , peter , will not stop until they find us .
but we can &apos;t leave until we have that list . all right ?
much as i &apos;d love a candy @-@ apple set of lock picks ,
i thought you might want this back .
thank you .
i &apos;d love to catch up , but i &apos;m late for a meeting .
was it the passports ?
no , it wasn &apos;t .
then what was it ? i know you , sara .
you wouldn &apos;t have cut out like that unless you had a reason to .
okay , fine . it was the passports .
you had brilliantly forged i.d.s ,
and it dawned on me -- you &apos;re a con man .
are you happy ?
no .
i want the truth .
neal ... i saw the treasure .
i saw it on your laptop . you hid it from me .
you hid it from peter , and you &apos;re hiding it from the fbi .
and now you &apos;re here to find out if i &apos;m gonna keep my mouth shut .
it &apos;s not as cold as that .
really ? then what is it ?
now you owe me the truth .
were you gonna say goodbye to me ?
no .
sara .
what ? !
would you have come with me ?
would i have come with you ?
how would that have worked ?
we &apos;d just go .
the whole world at our feet ?
i came so close to asking you .
but you didn &apos;t .
no .
well , then , there &apos;s your answer .
sara .
this explains why neal isn &apos;t picking up his phone .
well ...
i would hate to keep neal from his crime @-@ solving duties .
take care , sara .
it &apos;s good to see you , peter .
you too .
you &apos;ve come to collect me in person .
i &apos;m hesitant to ask , but why ?
we got word on matthew keller .
matthew keller -- neal &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
that &apos;s stretching it .
as most of you know , last year ,
keller broke out of prison
during his transfer to a maximum @-@ security facility .
he also arranged to have you kidnapped .
i remember that . unfortunately , he got away then .
but up until this week , his trail was cold .
jones ?
keller recently turned up
on some security footage in egypt .
apparently , he &apos;s been taking advantage
of the political unrest in the region .
while the people and police take to the streets ,
he takes priceless pieces from museums .
classic keller .
well , this time , he did well for himself .
he stole this -- you &apos;re looking at
a one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind 3,500 @-@ year @-@ old amulet .
once in the tomb of narmer the first .
the amulet of the lost pharaoh .
the new egyptian government considers it a national treasure
and , obviously , irreplaceable .
do we have any leads on where keller may be ?
he &apos;s off the grid again , but the egyptians believe
the amulet &apos;s been smuggled into manhattan .
the bureau wants us to find it and return it .
we exercise extreme caution , given keller &apos;s involvement .
he &apos;s in our city --
we bring him to justice .
neal , let &apos;s talk .
what do you think keller &apos;s up to ?
it &apos;s too early to tell .
whatever we think he &apos;s doing ,
he &apos;s probably three steps past it by now .
why risk doing business in the u.s. ,
with someone in new york ?
oh , he &apos;s always been brazen .
think they &apos;re on to us ?
或藏有外星科技
has keller contacted you ?
no . why ?
as hard as we &apos;ve tried ,
versions of what happened to adler &apos;s sub have leaked out .
it &apos;s hard to keep a secret that big .
yeah .
keller &apos;s a smart guy .
he starts putting those rumors together ...
you &apos;re wondering if he made the same assumption you did .
if he &apos;s thinking you &apos;re in possession
of $ 1 billion worth of lost artwork ,
that &apos;s a reason big enough to draw him back .
for it , and for you .
if he thinks i stole the treasure ,
let &apos;s use it to take him down .
we found it -- the new york connection
between the egyptian stolen amulet and keller .
great . anybody we know ?
you tell me .
the egyptians believe the shipment was sent
to an ancient @-@ civilizations expert in soho
named raquel laroque .
i know the name . she &apos;s an egyptologist .
apparently , that &apos;s her day job .
she &apos;s a fence ?
and a damn good one .
check out her concealment technique .
the shipments she gets
look like egyptian gift @-@ shop tchotchkes .
but in reality ...
they &apos;re highly durable x @-@ ray @-@ proof molds
built around real , priceless artifacts .
the mummy returns . sexy .
thought you might like that .
ms. laroque has put out word
that she &apos;s in the market for a restoration tech .
she needs someone to extract the artifacts
without damaging them .
it &apos;s challenging work .
mm . know anyone who can pull it off ?
talk to your crime super @-@ friends and make it happen .
we get this amulet , we &apos;re one step closer to keller .
all right .
hey , what do you know about raquel laroque ?
not much beyond she &apos;s an egyptologist .
i hear she &apos;s spicy .
what does that mean ?
i don &apos;t know . not all my information &apos;s helpful .
hale .
what &apos;s up , man ?
i heard moz did some work on your mobile office .
yeah , i &apos;m still learning all the bells and whistles .
mozzie refuses to write down instructions .
obviously , we don &apos;t want
any public record of our modifications .
i &apos;ll settle for that degas you keep promising .
it &apos;s coming . soon .
yeah , we had a minor complication .
what if we could get you something better ?
well , my buyer has his heart set on that degas --
before we can move any of it ,
do you know a fence named raquel laroque ?
i do .
she has this intricate concealment technique .
yeah , that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to talk to her about .
she &apos;s in the market for a new restoration tech .
if you get the job ,
that will help eliminate your delay with the degas ?
uh , yes . uh , you vouch for neal , it will expedite the sale .
neal ?
it will .
all right , then . i &apos;ll set up a meeting .
your guy &apos;s very late .
he &apos;ll show . hale is very reliable .
you and sara ?
yes . me and sara .
over ?
yes .
so what i witnessed ...
return of the breakup bag .
all right .
what happened to you guys ?
and don &apos;t give me the &quot; we &apos;re just different people &quot; routine .
we are very different people .
not everybody can be peter and elizabeth , okay ?
ah , speaking of , since hale &apos;s running late --
hey , honey . how &apos;s the stakeout going ?
uh , that &apos;s why i &apos;m calling .
looks like it &apos;s running longer than expected .
oh , no .
i hate to say this , but i don &apos;t think
we &apos;re gonna be able to make
tray and sheila &apos;s barbecue tonight .
wow , that &apos;s too bad , &apos; cause i was ready to walk out the door .
aw , i &apos;m sure you were .
she can &apos;t stand tray and sheila .
but , you know , you could go without me ,
unless , of course , you &apos;re already settled in
with a cup of tea and a new book .
i know thee well , as well , which means
you &apos;re gonna make up for canceling on me
when you get home , mister .
oh , honey , do you know you &apos;re on speaker ?
oh . hi , neal .
hi , elizabeth .
all right , well , crack this case soon , will you ?
we will . we both will --
sorry , el . got to go .
okay . well , you owe me .
okay . love you .
why &apos;d you cut me off ?
well , i just didn &apos;t want you talking with el about the case .
oh . by &quot; the case , &quot;
you mean you don &apos;t want me to mention keller ?
she got pretty riled up after i was taken .
there &apos;s no need to mention keller &apos;s name to her
when we don &apos;t even know yet if he &apos;s on the continent .
ahh . there &apos;s raquel .
love how she picked a mob hangout .
safest cafe in the city .
she won &apos;t stay here long . any way of contacting hale ?
i paged him .
old school .
yeah . you &apos;d like him .
i don &apos;t want to lose her . she &apos;s our only link to keller .
hale &apos;s already laid the groundwork .
she knows she &apos;s meeting me .
let me make the approach . then you try to bust us .
once we successfully evade your evil clutches ,
i &apos;ll gain her confidence .
that &apos;s a plan .
or ... you make the approach , i arrest both of you ,
and release you two together after a grueling interrogation .
when she sees you didn &apos;t flip on her ,
she &apos;ll embrace you in her evil circle of trust .
yeah . early in a relationship , it &apos;s better to experience a win .
okay . tell you what .
when you &apos;re an fbi agent
and i &apos;m the ward of the federal prison system ,
we &apos;ll do it your way .
all this time , i thought we were partners .
we are . it &apos;s just , tie always goes to me .
you ready ?
you &apos;re the boss .
diana , neal &apos;s making his approach .
&quot; hail my heart . hail my heart .
hail my transformation . &quot;
book of the dead , chapter 30b .
i &apos;m impressed .
it &apos;s inscribed on the back
of a 3,500 @-@ year @-@ old scarab amulet
recently removed from the egyptian national museum .
you know that , and yet no hale .
our friend told you a lot more than he should have .
he trusts me .
then where is he ?
he &apos;ll show .
thank you .
may i see the piece ?
you think i &apos;d bring it on a first date ?
i still have half a mind to kill you .
i &apos;d rather you didn &apos;t .
but if you do ...
... i &apos;d really like to see
the amulet of the lost pharaoh before i go .
why don &apos;t we start with this ?
egyptian faience ...
composed of crushed quartz ,
sand , calcite , lime , and alkalis .
i &apos;d describe it as a late @-@ middle @-@ kingdom shabti ,
沙伯替 木乃伊小人俑
buried with the pharaohs to protect them in an afterlife .
it &apos;s not middle kingdom .
the plaster &apos;s modern , and it has a higher calcium content ,
probably to protect whatever &apos;s inside it .
it &apos;s very hard to get to what &apos;s inside .
i could put together a restoring process in an afternoon .
i like your confidence and your passion .
but i still need to talk to hale .
until then .
we &apos;re both walking into the unknown without hale .
but sometimes you trust your instinct .
my instinct says walk away .
i see you brought company .
the feds .
yeah . what &apos;s our story ?
i &apos;m not talking to them .
not with airport shabti on me .
all right .
i &apos;ll get us out of here . come on .
feds . fbi raid . raid .
fbi .
what &apos;s he talking about ?
feds ?
where ?
what is this ?
i &apos;m trying to have a nice lunch here .
we &apos;re not here for you , all right ?
then take me , officer .
don &apos;t take him . he &apos;s nobody . - forget him .
nobody ? - watch your mouth .
the tie was supposed to go to me .
you &apos;re resourceful .
team effort . you picked the cafe .
still , my last partner --
partner ?
restoration tech .
he created the molds around these pieces in egypt .
what happened to him ?
well , he wasn &apos;t as resourceful as you are .
he &apos;ll be in an egyptian prison for a long time .
well , at least he shipped you the amulet before he was arrested .
so he says . no way of knowing until we unwrap it .
taxi .
keep your schedule open .
i &apos;ll let you know when and where .
how can i get in touch ?
you can &apos;t .
no , no . no dusting off . no smiling .
don &apos;t come in here with a grin on your face .
but i &apos;m in .
yeah , but the plan was
for me to haul you and her in to the fbi .
i was good with that plan .
and yet you yelled , &quot; fbi raid . &quot;
look , she had an artifact on her .
raquel wasn &apos;t about to turn herself in .
oh . raquel , huh ? hmm .
what ?
oh , nothing .
mysterious , gorgeous , she wears a hat .
she &apos;s an expert in a certain subject
that you find particularly sexy .
what are you talking about ?
just wondering why you ditched me .
i told you , peter , she &apos;s a thief .
and you are ...
someone who escaped your capture
in a crowded restaurant by saying two words -- &quot; fbi raid . &quot;
don &apos;t get cocky .
may i ?
yes , you may .
it &apos;s moz .
what &apos;s going on ? hale didn &apos;t show today .
neal , he had a reason .
what is it ?
hale &apos;s dead .
i &apos;m sorry , moz .
hale didn &apos;t have any enemies .
he was the last of the gentleman fences .
we &apos;ll find out what happened .
they have any idea who did this ?
no fingerprints , no blood splatter , nothing .
did you check the security feed ?
security feed ?
yeah , he installed it .
why didn &apos;t you tell anyone ?
i tried to .
what do you need ?
all i need is a laptop and a usb cable .
ticktock , everyone .
the feed is sound @-@ activated .
it only records when someone &apos;s talking .
i might have that piece of art for you .
talk to you later .
get out .
keller .
you okay ?
yeah .
how did keller know hale ?
he didn &apos;t .
i would have known if he did .
so hale &apos;s death is somehow
connected to raquel and the amulet .
unless it &apos;s something else .
peter , i wish i knew .
i &apos;m shutting down this operation .
i can &apos;t take the chance that keller knows
that you &apos;re going under with raquel .
keller doesn &apos;t know we &apos;ve seen him .
he thinks he sanitized the car .
keep me under with raquel .
no , not until i know more information
on how hale died .
we may lose her by then , peter .
if this is keller &apos;s plan ,
raquel is the best way to draw him out .
okay .
i want keller stopped .
sara .
sara ellis , right ?
may i help you ?
yeah . agent sloan , interpol .
we need to talk about neal caffrey .
i &apos;m sorry . today &apos;s not a good day , so perhaps some other time .
afraid not .
and , uh ...
i know about the treasure .
excuse me ? i don &apos;t follow .
come on , sara .
can i call you sara ?
no .
look , this doesn &apos;t have to be antagonistic .
we &apos;ve been following mr. caffrey
ever since we learned of the suspicious events
surrounding vincent adler &apos;s death .
the fire and the sub , that &apos;s public knowledge ,
but ... neal caffrey &apos;s extravagant lifestyle while serving time
is something we think you can help shed some light on .
well , neal caffrey and i are no longer seeing each other ,
so we &apos;re not in contact .
see , that is news ,
&apos;cause we saw you two together the other morning .
there you both are , what , purchasing four helicopters .
what does one do with four helicopters ?
sterling @-@ bosch has some pretty strict rules
about theft recovery , sara .
your boss , has he mentioned anything
about an internal investigation ?
no .
that &apos;s right .
probably because i haven &apos;t mentioned this case to him yet .
well , i honestly don &apos;t know what to tell you .
yeah , you do .
just give me something .
give me something , and maybe neal skates on a light sentence .
but if not , caffrey goes down hard ,
and i &apos;ve got enough to
make you an accessory .
simple piece of information , sara .
it &apos;s your choice .
thank you very much . - we &apos;ll do our best .
appreciate it .
they look important .
from the egyptian embassy . what do you have ?
heard from raquel .
so , when is the rendezvous ?
2 : 00 tomorrow . her lab .
good . we &apos;ve got her place staked out , and her phone &apos;s tapped .
no more leads on keller ?
no . but i wasn &apos;t expecting any .
listen , you may want to say something to el
now that we &apos;re sure keller &apos;s back .
neal caffrey suggests
that someone shouldn &apos;t keep secrets from their partner .
where &apos;s this coming from ?
someone who keeps a lot of secrets .
let &apos;s nail keller this time .
let &apos;s .
where &apos;s neal ?
oh . hello to you , too .
no , mozzie . this is important .
did you try calling him ?
i can &apos;t .
you don &apos;t want to , or you &apos;re not
physically capable of dialing a telephone ?
okay , do you still sweep this place for bugs ?
what do you think ? you may speak freely within these walls .
i know about the treasure .
what treasure ?
mozzie , i saw it on neal &apos;s laptop .
oh , damn it .
he wants you to run away to the island with us .
so neal told you .
he didn &apos;t tell me . oh .
did i tell you ?
mozzie , there is an interpol agent
who is on to you and neal .
he has been following me for weeks ,
and he knows about the treasure .
did you tell him anything ?
well , i had to give him something .
oh , to protect yourself .
no , to protect all of us .
he was gonna drag us all in .
neal was really gonna tell me everything ?
yes , but i talked him out of it
for the exact reason that you &apos;re standing here right now .
what did you tell the agent ?
i never said that you two were involved ,
but i had to give him the
i.p. address for the treasure @-@ cam .
how long ago ? - i don &apos;t know . i --
how long ?
40 minutes ago .
i didn &apos;t give him the password .
i assumed it wasn &apos;t easily hacked .
u @-@ unless you &apos;re interpol !
i @-@ i have to shut down the feed .
well , you already know about agent sloan .
that &apos;s who you met ?
yeah .
and you gave him the i.p. address ?
mozzie , what ?
it &apos;s the one man who wants neal dead .
hey , moz . what &apos;s going on ?
keller &apos;s been posing as an interpol agent .
he met with sara .
what ?
she had no idea who he was .
is she okay ?
yes , but she did give up the i.p. address .
no .
i reset the feed .
is it secure ? - it is now .
all right . if he &apos;s seen the feed ,
he knows the treasure is real .
look -- even if keller did get a glimpse of it ,
there &apos;s no way he could trace it back to the warehouse .
like there &apos;s no way a swatch of my canvas
could have survived the fire ?
i &apos;m going to put a backup plan for keller into place .
you take care of securing the art . i &apos;ll handle keller .
no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m gonna stop keller once and for all , okay ?
neal ?
ne--
thank you .
here you go .
jones , we have to stop meeting like this .
i bet you say that to all the agents .
turn it off only if she sweeps for bugs .
if i lose contact with you
for more than a minute , i &apos;m coming in .
got it .
and the password for the day is ...
inscription .
no chances . keep it simple .
the instant you know it &apos;s the real scarab amulet ,
you call us in .
here we go .
hello .
not so fast .
my wand .
to make sure we &apos;re alone .
of course .
well , that was fast .
he &apos;ll come back online .
in 50 seconds , we move in .
very nice .
wasn &apos;t so painful .
without it , we &apos;d have to work in the nude .
ancient spirits ?
air conditioner .
it has a life of its own .
this is what i want you to see .
he &apos;s back .
in 8 seconds , i was gonna move in .
we can expect keller to strike in a window that small .
genius .
looks like a $ 20 paperweight .
let &apos;s hope it &apos;s not .
be careful with it .
this one &apos;s special .
bless me , father , for i &apos;m about to sin .
we all are .
you found me . what do you want ?
i need your help with a problem .
matthew keller . $ 6 million ?
he killed a friend of mine .
now he &apos;s threatening others close to me .
this is a lot .
you got a particular client in mind for the job ?
contact all of them . it &apos;s open season on keller .
spoils go to the victor .
you got an address ?
let your people earn their money .
they can find him .
yeah . leave something in the collection plate .
let &apos;s see how this works .
the a.c. isn &apos;t working .
i &apos;m gonna shut it off .
can you survive a little sweat ?
it &apos;s the thrill of new york in the summer .
look at this .
you can see the hieroglyphics
indented in the mold .
it &apos;s a beautiful language .
it &apos;s an art , really .
you ever heard of the papyrus seven scrolls ?
of course .
it &apos;s a shame they were proven to be forgeries .
only after a dozen different egyptologists weighed in .
i know . i was one of them .
those were a work of art .
that was you ?
no .
there is that speculation .
a forger , a restoration tech ,
an escape artist .
the things we could do together .
come on , neal . just uncover the damn amulet .
and there it is .
i &apos;ve waited for this one my entire career .
have you ever experienced the thrill
of discovering a real treasure ?
all right . let &apos;s get ready to move in .
caffrey should give us the signal any minute .
i &apos;m experiencing it now .
let &apos;s suit up .
you read the inscription ?
&quot; you have come forth
to the beautiful place to which we run . &quot;
it &apos;s remarkable , isn &apos;t it ?
who are you ?
matthew keller .
i &apos;m an old friend of neal &apos;s .
we were something , but we were never friends .
then think of me as the man
who stole that amulet from the egyptian museum .
you ?
impressive , huh ?
now i kind of want it back .
what are you worried about ?
don &apos;t worry about the boys in the van .
the feds ain &apos;t coming .
feds ?
oh , let me guess . he didn &apos;t tell you ?
yeah , he &apos;s a criminal consultant for the fbi .
right , buddy ?
you &apos;re neal caffrey .
well , look at that . you &apos;re famous .
raquel , this man is incredibly dangerous .
don &apos;t believe anything he tells you .
you should listen to some things i tell you .
oh ! hey !
this is spicy , huh ?
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on between you two ,
but i &apos;m not sticking around to find out .
that &apos;s a good idea , sweetheart . this is just guy talk .
boys will be boys .
raquel .
i trusted you .
she seems nice .
what do you want ?
come on , neal .
i want the treasure .
you set this up .
you stole the amulet and had raquel &apos;s restorer
arrested in egypt so she &apos;d need someone new .
too bad you didn &apos;t put that together before now .
someone put a hit on keller ?
yeah . big one . $ 6 million .
how much ?
rockie , keep your distance .
he &apos;s at my place right now .
this is not the time for you to be getting into this .
no . he owes me .
must be something pretty important in that warehouse .
turns out , neal ,
you &apos;re sitting on one of the greatest treasures
never discovered .
i don &apos;t have a treasure .
i know you don &apos;t .
i do .
that &apos;s the air conditioner .
jones .
yeah ?
didn &apos;t she say she turned off the a.c. ?
yeah , i thought so .
play back the audio .
the a.c. isn &apos;t working . i &apos;m gonna shut it off .
can you survive a little sweat ?
the thrill of new york in the summer .
she shut it off . we &apos;re on an audio loop .
all agents , i want a visual .
surround the building . we &apos;re moving in .
come see what i found .
there it is .
i wanted to see your face when you figured it out .
i won , neal .
shots fired !
distance , caffrey .
damn it .
you know , you should be proud .
hale -- he didn &apos;t want to give up the knowledge on the degas .
and sara --
pretty little sara , whose heart you broke --
she didn &apos;t want to betray you , either .
congratulations .
you made friends .
i can &apos;t wait to take you down .
fbi ! open up !
they took their time .
neal !
oh , the amulet . consolation prize .
neal !
peter , it &apos;s neal ! i &apos;m alone and unarmed , okay ?
i &apos;m unlocking the door .
what &apos;s going on ?
keller was here . he &apos;s armed .
what ? where &apos;d he go ?
that door .
i &apos;ll check upstairs .
anything ?
clear .
jones ?
clear .
where the hell did he go ?
jones , get affrey .
a rabbit hole .
yeah . that &apos;s where he went .
peter .
he &apos;s gone .
he &apos;s off anklet .
find him .
all right , i &apos;m almost at the warehouse .
we need a solid plan , moz .
okay . it &apos;s coming up .
wait . neal .
what is it ?
he &apos;s not in the warehouse .
wait . his men are gone ?
what did they take ?
hold on . let me check something .
let me look at the old feed .
yes .
they &apos;re there , but they &apos;re not there there .
what are you saying ?
it &apos;s a fake warehouse .
the treasure room on cam -- it &apos;s not ours .
keller must have hacked the feed .
he faked it ?
apparently he couldn &apos;t
follow the signal to the real location ,
so he made a replica .
and the only reason he showed up at the lab
was to get me to lead him to the real warehouse .
off anklet .
damn it .
the fbi has no idea where you are ,
so he can take you down .
are you being followed ?
maybe .
all right . i got an idea .
lead him someplace else ,
and then hide there until help arrives .
exactly . what &apos;s around here ?
okay , uh -- the palace .
the palace . always a fan favorite .
uh , father .
i have an address that you will find useful .
have you ever heard of the palace ?
hey . caffrey &apos;s gps is back on .
where is he ?
5 beekman .
let &apos;s go .
come on , caffrey .
i know you &apos;re not keeping the loot on an upper level .
i &apos;m not keeping the loot in this building .
you &apos;re as predictable as everyone else , you know that ?
the moment you saw your precious cargo had been hauled away ,
you dodged the feds and led me right to it .
or i figured out your plan ...
brought you here instead .
yeah , i don &apos;t think so . show me where it is .
let &apos;s just work together on this one , huh ?
what do you say ?
let &apos;s be honest -- it &apos;s your only chance at survival .
peter can &apos;t ever know
that you stole the goods from under his nose , neal .
it &apos;ll break his heart .
so i can help relieve you of this burden .
you can continue your criminal @-@ consultant life
here in new york -- i mean , it &apos;s win @-@ win .
you &apos;re as predictable as everyone else , keller .
your arrogance .
your greed .
you &apos;re trapped .
nobody &apos;s coming , neal .
but what i can &apos;t understand
is why you would sit on the treasure for so long .
i mean , it seems to me you either sell it ,
you turn it in , or you run , right ?
or the feds are on their way and i don &apos;t have it .
you don &apos;t deserve it .
you don &apos;t even have what it takes to hold on to it .
you &apos;re not the only one who knows where it is .
i &apos;ll tell mozzie you said hi .
fbi ! drop your weapon .
i didn &apos;t lie to you , keller .
i don &apos;t have the treasure .
it &apos;s good to see you again , burkey .
shooter !
where &apos;s keller ?
there he is .
all units , pursue suspect
on the northwest side of the building .
i got the shooter .
raquel .
why did you run ?
talk .
keller escaped . i went after him .
you had a dozen federal agents at your side .
why did you cut your audio feed and your gps ?
what did keller want with you ?
you were right . he thought i had the treasure .
i led him to the palace ,
the kind of place he &apos;d believe i &apos;d hide it ,
i turned on the gps so you could follow me --
after you escaped .
otherwise you would have shown up before i got there .
keller would have fled . peter , it worked .
we had him .
until she took a shot at him .
i don &apos;t know why she did that .
maybe because someone put a $ 6 million bounty out on keller .
$ 6 million ?
i guess we &apos;re not the only ones who want him .
guess not .
bring her in .
give me your foot .
you can go .
you had me , caffrey .
look -- peter &apos;s a good agent .
he wants keller more than you do .
that bastard took my scarab .
see you around , raquel .
sit down .
sara .
what are you doing here ?
peter called me in .
to make a statement about my meeting with keller .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re safe .
i had a long talk with mozzie .
your secret &apos;s safe with me , neal .
i hope you don &apos;t forget everything between us .
well , no . not everything .
i won &apos;t forget about that raphael you stole .
allegedly .
hi .
hi .
did you catch any bad guys today ?
a couple .
oh , good . i can go back to sleep now .
come to bed .
honey , you okay ?
there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
okay . i &apos;m listening .
one of the guys we were pursuing --
he got away .
are you concerned ?
it &apos;s matthew keller .
what ? keller &apos;s in new york ?
hon , i was gonna tell you .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because we weren &apos;t sure . then we had him cornered --
honey , this man had you kidnapped .
i know . we &apos;re gonna find him .
fbi has got him on the most @-@ wanted list ,
the u.s. marshals are out in full force ,
and there &apos;s a bounty on his head .
i should have told you .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t do this .
i can handle it . you know that .
i know .
what i can &apos;t handle is finding out after something happens .
nothing will .
i promise .
so they have a bounty on him , huh ?
yeah .
all we know at this point
is that they &apos;re willing to pay $ 6 million
to make him go away .
the van dyck . good .
matisse .
degas .
where &apos;s the degas ?
mozzie , what did you do ?
yeah ?
we arrested keller .
except as we were cuffing him , someone shot him .
winged him .
and in the chaos , he escaped .
someone put a bounty on his head .
a $ 6 million bounty .
now , that &apos;s roughly
the black @-@ market sale price of the degas .
no . that &apos;s exactly the sale price of the degas .
you fenced it .
you should have asked me .
well , you should have told me
sara knew about the warehouse .
i guess we &apos;re in the habit of keeping secrets now .
you took out a hit on keller ?
he killed hale .
he went after sara .
keller wasn &apos;t gonna stop till he destroys you .
i told you not to sell it .
it was all set up . i didn &apos;t have time to fence anything else .
it &apos;s on the list , moz ! it &apos;s on the damn list .
excuse me ?
where did you get this ?
you told me when you broke into peter &apos;s house
the list wasn &apos;t there .
it was .
you lied to me ?
we got bigger problems , all right ?
when the degas turns up -- and it will --
the fbi is gonna know the treasure didn &apos;t burn .
and we &apos;re the prime suspects .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
look , it doesn &apos;t matter now . who did you fence it through ?
we have to get it back .
or we &apos;re done , moz .
