mystic falls ... i was born here .
this is my home .
and mine .
and mine .
for centuries , supernatural creatures have lived among us .
they were vampires , werewolves , doppelgangers ...
witches .
and even hybrids .
then there &apos;s elena . she &apos;s one of us now .
why am i acting like this ?
there may be one chance to save her ...
nice ink .
tell him what the hunter told you
the tattoo leads to !
he said there was a cure .
no one must know about the cure , do you understand ?
the hunter holds the key ,
and he &apos;ll stop at nothing to kill us all .
you have any idea what i &apos;ve been through ?
i spent the last two days chained up by an original vampire .
so you met klaus ?
i only know him by reputation .
apparently he &apos;s a real monster .
he &apos;s a vampire @-@ werewolf hybrid .
do you know how hard it is to kill them ?
from what i gather , you have to ...
remove their head , or their heart .
that is , according to lore . i &apos;m just speculating .
i had to figure out how to do it on my own .
i could have used some
of this occult professor knowledge of yours .
but then again , you &apos;ve always been slow
when it comes to providing answers .
we had a deal .
i &apos;ll give you answers about your hunter &apos;s mark
when it &apos;s grown to completion .
in other words , kill as many vampires as possible .
come on , connor ,
why do you think i sent you to mystic falls ?
there &apos;s no shortage of vampires .
that town &apos;s practically infested .
listen , there &apos;s a witch
mixed up in all this .
she &apos;s important to what i have planned .
i want her to be kept out of harm &apos;s way .
anybody gets in my way--
anybody--
they &apos;re dead .
ok ...
sure , i &apos;ll occupy her myself .
just do what you do .
and the less i know about it , the better .
do i have your attention ?
good .
then let &apos;s talk about vampires .
&quot; dear diary ,
i know it &apos;s been a while .
a long while .
i haven &apos;t needed ...
i haven &apos;t wanted to write this stuff down .
but i don &apos;t want to say it out loud , either .
the thing is ...
i &apos;m a vampire .
and i hate it . &quot;
she &apos;s been spiraling since her transition .
there are times i barely recognize her .
but now for the first time in a while ,
there &apos;s hope .
i feel hopeless .
depressed . angry .
but most of all ...
i &apos;m scared .
somewhere in the world ,
there &apos;s a cure for vampires .
if i can get it ,
elena can be human again .
i can give her back her life .
part of me just wants to end it .
but then i think of jeremy ,
and all that he has left .
so , i need to find a way through this .
no matter what it takes .
so that &apos;s what i need to do .
no matter what klaus asks ;
no matter what lies i have to tell ,
or secrets i have to keep , i &apos;ll do it .
no matter what it takes .
how the hell did connor escape ?
i blame mind @-@ numbing incompetence ,
but pointing fingers isn &apos;t going to help me .
you &apos;re going to help me .
well , he could be anywhere now .
think , stefan .
he took the hybrid &apos;s head ,
which means he wants werewolf toxin .
which means he plans to stay in mystic falls to kill vampires .
which is a pity .
as i &apos;m half of the world
digging up a dead hunter ,
you &apos;ll have no access to my blood .
and therefore the antidote . nevertheless ,
his tattoo is our only map to the cure ,
so your task is quite simple .
find him , catch him ,
and above all , keep him alive .
he &apos;s no good to us dead .
damon &apos;s been looking everywhere for him . if they cross paths ...
you need to keep damon in check .
it would be a lot easier if i could just tell him the truth .
you trust damon with the cure ?
i imagine he prefers elena the way she is .
nice try , klaus , but i trust damon
a hell of a lot more than i trust you .
and i trust no one .
which is why my sister is lying daggered in a box .
the more who find out about the cure ,
the more will go after it .
nations have gone to war over less .
you mark my words-- tell one soul
and i will throw the hunter &apos;s sword in the mediterranean
and we can end this quest right now .
am i understood ?
really ? jeremy , you &apos;re half an hour late .
get here now .
uh , matt ?
uh , hey , april . we don &apos;t open till eleven .
oh , sorry . i wasn &apos;t , like ,
trying to scare you or stalk you or whatever .
i just , um , i came to ask if you &apos;ve seen rebekah ?
why would i have seen rebekah ?
oh , i just assumed .
i mean , aren &apos;t you guys kind of line a thing ?
rebekah and i are not a thing .
well , i mean , i &apos;m worried about her .
she said she &apos;d help me find
stuff out about the fire that killed my dad ,
and then she just disappeared .
trust me ...
that &apos;s the least of your problems .
excuse me . what are you doing ?
where &apos;s stefan ?
ok , good morning to you , too .
he &apos;s not answering his phone and he &apos;s not here ,
which , you know , big deal ,
we &apos;ve only got a killer vampire hunter on the loose .
i haven &apos;t talked to him yet today .
give me your phone . maybe he &apos;s dodging me .
why would he be dodging you ?
oh , i don &apos;t know ,
maybe the hot , sweaty dance party business ?
i figured you spilled your guilty little guts to him
when i left last night .
ohh , you didn &apos;t tell him , did you ?
no , damon .
i didn &apos;t tell him that i got high on blood
like some crack head
and dirty danced with you .
it was a mistake , ok ? i wasn &apos;t ... myself .
and besides , he &apos;s already got enough to deal with ,
trying to get me through this vampire stuff .
oh , i see . this is classic shame spiral .
i &apos;m not in a shame spiral .
oh , you so are . newbie vampire remorse ?
whoof , it &apos;s worse than a hangover .
i &apos;m not in a shame spiral , damon !
hey , it &apos;s stefan . leave a message .
so either he &apos;s dodging both of us .
or something &apos;s wrong .
sit down . sit down !
gilbert , give me your cell phone .
look , at least let april go .
she doesn &apos;t have anything to do with this .
she has everything to do with this .
her and her father .
plus , she and i have history .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;ve never seen you before in my life !
you kids need to get some vervain .
and don &apos;t just wear it as a
bracelet where anybody can just take it off .
maybe then you &apos;d remember
our conversation at the hybrid &apos;s yesterday .
our conversation ?
are you saying someone compelled me ? !
will someone please tell me what he &apos;s talking about ? !
compulsion . secrets . vampires .
if you know so much ,
then you know our friends are going to come for us .
oh , yeah , i &apos;m counting on it .
every vampire that comes for you
is another one i get to kill .
now , who should i text first , hmm ?
damon salvatore ? his brother stefan ?
tyler lockwood ?
all of the above .
日落之时就是他们的死期
so we each take a different entrance , hit him at the same time .
stefan !
where the hell have you been ?
coming up with a plan ? yeah , we have a plan .
the plan is i &apos;m going to rip connor &apos;s heart out
and i am going to feed it to him .
that &apos;s not a plan . we need to be careful .
connor has jeremy and who knows how many other hostages .
hence the open heart surgery .
damon &apos;s right . connor &apos;s strong ,
but he &apos;s not going to be able to take all of us .
i called in the hybrids to help , too .
my mom put squad cars blocking the streets .
they &apos;re saying it &apos;s a faulty gas main . we &apos;re good to go .
good . great . no cop ,
no witnesses , no reason to wait around .
all right , hold on , you &apos;re not all going .
he shot me like 9 times .
if we &apos;re killing him , i want in .
he &apos;s got jeremy , i &apos;m going .
listen , nobody is going anywhere
until i figure out what we &apos;re walking into .
until you figure it out ?
is that where you &apos;ve been all morning ,
out buying bossy pants ?
this guy &apos;s known for setting traps , right ?
we &apos;d be pretty dumb to walk into one ,
especially if he has werewolf venom .
does he ?
he &apos;s had it before .
fine . fine .
you want to take some time to do recon , you get one hour .
but we &apos;re going to need some extra help ,
so where the hell &apos;s the wicked witch of the west ?
she can &apos;t do magic .
really ?
call her , tell her jeremy &apos;s life is in danger .
maybe that &apos;ll bring her out of retirement .
i can &apos;t believe you wrote a book .
i did . i wrote three books , actually .
two of them are just two more to find to display .
i &apos;m finding them online .
no , no , you &apos;re not . come on ,
you promised , remember ?
right ? no cell phones ,
and no internet during witch therapy .
here . this is yours .
right now i want you to focus .
and i want your undivided attention .
you really think you can help me start practicing magic again ?
absolutely , i can .
i invited you here because i can .
but you know what , right now , just relax .
drink your tea .
i got this in australia when i was backpacking
with these aborigine spirit guides .
trust me , it &apos;s better when you smoke it ,
but i &apos;m trying to be a role model .
bonnie ...
listen , the thing is ,
what i have in mind might come off
as a little unorthodox .
now i &apos;m officially curious .
good .
what do you know about hypnosis ?
you really think that would work ?
what , you practice witchcraft
but you don &apos;t believe in hypnotism ?
bonnie , listen ...
you &apos;re afraid to practice magic
because those witch spirits convinced you it &apos;s wrong .
they threatened your grams and they made you feel guilty .
you just have to
confront that fear ... and that guilt .
and remove it .
maybe . i don &apos;t think hypnosis would work .
witches are naturally immune to any sort of manipulation .
really ?
let me ask you something .
how &apos;d you like to put that earring back on ?
you expect me to care about bloody hostages ?
you should . damon does .
so does caroline , tyler , elena .
if any of them get to connor ,
then you just wasted a trip to italy .
i can buy us some time , but damon &apos;s getting antsy .
so if you want connor alive ,
you better get your hybrids onboard with my plan .
who is he talking to ?
bonnie , hopefully .
maybe she &apos;s decided to make herself useful again .
what is that ?
it &apos;s our way in , courtesy of alaric saltzman &apos;s
interest in the mystic falls underground railroad .
the tunnels , like the ones in the lockwood cellar .
yep .
what did you find out ?
i could only make out the voices .
how many hostages ?
three . but , elena , it &apos;s matt .
and april young .
what ? !
those two idiots .
they &apos;re like danger magnets .
we have to get them out of there .
yeah , i just need a little more time .
the clock &apos;s ticking , brother .
you know , i could do without the color commentary .
i &apos;m going in these tunnels .
no , you &apos;re not . this guy doesn &apos;t know
that you &apos;re a vampire . let &apos;s keep it that way .
maybe that &apos;s it .
i can offer to trade myself
in exchange for the hostages .
no ! best case scenario is ,
now you &apos;re a hostage .
worst case scenario-- he figures you out ,
kills you on the spot .
stop treating me like i can &apos;t handle myself .
alaric trained me ,
and i &apos;ve been practicing with stefan .
so what ? now you &apos;re going to take on a professional killer ?
bang , you &apos;re dead .
now what ?
head shot &apos;s no good .
it has to be the heart . so now you &apos;re dead .
for someone that doesn &apos;t want to be like me ,
you sure are good at it .
my brother &apos;s the only thing
that &apos;s holding me together right now , damon .
if anything happens to him ...
we &apos;ll get him out . i promise .
he &apos;s clearly delusional .
i mean , right ? all this--
all this talk about vampires ?
i--i mean , he mentioned my dad .
hey , this guy &apos;s a nut job , ok ?
don &apos;t let him get in your head .
what if he knows something ?
jeremy ... did he say anything to you
about why he &apos;s doing this ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
maybe i just can &apos;t remember .
let it go . jeremy !
you said we had a conversation yesterday ?
about what ?
we &apos;ll get into that .
first , take a look at my handiwork .
pick up some tips from the hunter &apos;s trade .
what is all that ?
the fluid is derived from werewolf toxin .
trip the wire , bomb goes off ,
nails deliver a lethal dose into the bloodstream .
and what &apos;s the point ? what do you get out of all this ?
you know , i used to think that there was no &quot; get . &quot;
that i was just supposed to &quot; do . &quot;
kill vampires .
that was until i realized that the mark held the answer
to why i &apos;m the way i am .
the more i kill , the more it grows ,
and once it &apos;s complete ...
i &apos;ll learn my story , and--
and all this will have meant something .
hey ! we &apos;re going to have visitors soon .
you two get in the back . get up ! move !
and before you think about any other exits ,
i got every door rigged .
got it ?
stefan &apos;s on his way . this will be over soon .
will it ? i mean , haven &apos;t we
already been here before with jeremy ?
isn &apos;t this why we sent him to denver ?
well , we &apos;ll get him out of
this and we &apos;ll compel him down to the bahamas .
maybe he &apos;ll find an island girl .
did you find the tunnel map ?
got it .
it was in his weapon &apos;s drawer
with seven stakes , a weird macgyver crossbow
and the last remaining vervain in mystic falls .
so , how about we get this party started ?
not yet . klaus is sending one of his men .
he &apos;ll take the front and you and i can take the tunnels .
since when do we team up with klaus and the lollipop guild ?
well , i already told you , connor has werewolf venom .
we need someone to draw his fire ,
the hybrids are
immune to it , so they &apos;re our best bet .
well , how are you sure he even has werewolf venom ?
why is klaus involved , stefan ?
oh , stop being paranoid , damon .
start telling the truth ... stefan .
why is klaus involved ?
did he compel you ?
i am telling you the truth ,
this is the best way to get everyone out .
what is with you two ? we &apos;re wasting time !
you know what , she &apos;s right .
screw your plan . i &apos;ll kill connor myself .
stefan !
why are you doing this ?
damon had the right idea
with the tunnels , but i &apos;m not going to go in there
if i can &apos;t count on him to do it my way .
if you can &apos;t count on him ? you just vervained him !
do you think he cares about april or matt ?
he &apos;ll get jeremy out for you ,
but then he &apos;ll go right after connor no matter who gets hurt .
then i &apos;m coming with you .
you &apos;re not coming with me , elena !
you need my help !
what if connor attacks and you have to defend yourself ?
and what if you kill him ?
the guilt will wreck you .
you don &apos;t think that i &apos;m afraid of that ?
of course i am .
stefan , i &apos;m barely holding it together .
if jeremy gets hurt--
we &apos;ll get jeremy out , ok ?
i promise you . elena , listen to me , listen to me .
this is the most important thing
that i have ever asked you to do .
i just need you to trust me .
please .
look , man , this guy is dangerous .
he &apos;s highly trained , he &apos;s armed--
i can handle myself .
besides , klaus asked me personally .
this is a bad idea .
uh , who are you ?
who the hell are you ?
caroline .
ohh . you &apos;re tyler &apos;s girl .
he told me about you . i &apos;m hayley .
well , hayley , that &apos;s pretty crazy ,
&apos;cause i haven &apos;t heard a thing about you .
i &apos;ve been staying here a few days .
excuse me ?
i needed a place to crash , ty &apos;s a buddy .
he was kind enough to offer .
i know all of ty &apos;s buddies
and i haven &apos;t heard about you ,
so how about we cut the crap ?
yeah , i don &apos;t do teen drama .
take it up with ty .
excuse me .
dean , you don &apos;t need to do this .
stay out of this , hayley . i &apos;m going .
just listen to her , man . it &apos;s suicide .
klaus told you to take connor by yourself ,
and you can &apos;t even fight back ?
you have to use &quot; non @-@ lethal force &quot; ?
what the hell is that ?
klaus gave me a direct order .
it &apos;s too dangerous .
that maniac already killed nate .
you &apos;re not a hybrid , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like .
klaus asks for something , you do it .
look ... i &apos;m a hybrid .
i used to do everything klaus said .
but i don &apos;t anymore .
you don &apos;t have to , either .
you think you can stand up to klaus ?
here , prove it .
tyler , don &apos;t ...
hello ?
hey , klaus .
tyler . i hope you &apos;re not causing problems .
i can do whatever i want . i &apos;m not sired to you anymore .
fair enough . though i do happen to know your little secret
about your time in appalachia .
what was your friend &apos;s name ?
hayley , was it ?
you &apos;d probably prefer i kept that to myself .
i &apos;m sorry , mate .
are you going to answer
or should i just assume
you &apos;re back to being ... how did you phrase it ?
oh , yes . my little bitch .
do whatever the hell you want .
that &apos;s it ?
you just back down ? !
we &apos;re closed .
i want you to free the hostages .
i &apos;ll free them . as soon as you give me what i want--
you and everyone like you dead .
what , so your hunter &apos;s mark can grow ?
yeah , i know all about that .
what it means . what you are .
listen , you free the hostages
and you and i can have a little chat .
maybe i can tell you about the brotherhood of the five .
that &apos;s a weak move .
you must be desperate .
think about it , connor .
klaus saved your life , he needs you alive .
aren &apos;t you the least bit curious why ?
when i was a kid ,
my dad used to tell me these scary stories about vampires .
they &apos;re just stories .
not to that man out there .
there &apos;s something so familiar ...
about him .
look , this is a messed up situation .
the last thing that you want to do
is buy into that guy &apos;s craziness .
you &apos;re going to be fine .
we &apos;re getting out of here .
what is that ?
there used to be an exit through the old wine cellar .
they bricked it over .
so that &apos;s it , then ?
we &apos;re screwed .
no . we &apos;re not screwed .
there &apos;s no sign of anyone .
stefan &apos;s coming at him from the other side .
he &apos;ll free the hostages ,
your job is to get connor out alive .
and use caution , mate .
he favors booby traps and ambushes .
understood .
you may be a potential hunter ,
but you make one move ,
i will break all 27 bones in your hand .
they &apos;re not all bad , you know ?
some of them , they &apos;re my friends .
friends , huh ?
yeah , i had a friend like that once .
she got turned by this vampire i was hunting .
he thought it &apos;d be ironic .
what happened to her ?
i didn &apos;t want to hurt her .
she promised that she would keep it under control , but ...
a vampire &apos;s like a loaded gun .
eventually it &apos;s going to go off .
that &apos;s when i got this .
so you killed your own friend ?
listen !
if you &apos;re going to be like me , you need to understand .
vampires kill humans .
hunters kill vampires .
we have company .
oh , my god .
follow this map . get out of here .
take her to caroline &apos;s
so she can ...
ok .
stefan ! that guy &apos;s armed .
if you go out there , he &apos;s going to kill jeremy .
no one &apos;s killing anyone . go .
connor , you don &apos;t have to do this .
stefan ?
stefan , call me .
there was an explosion at the grill .
i need to know what &apos;s happening .
damon . hey .
can you get up ?
oh , where &apos;s stefan ?
i &apos;m going to kill him .
he took your ring ?
why would he do that ?
ughh . because he &apos;s playing us .
all this stalling , getting the hybrids ,
taking my ring , add it up .
he &apos;s either made a deal with klaus
or he &apos;s compelled .
then i need to get in there .
no , elena , this guy is dangerous !
so am i , damon !
then you need to be smart .
he doesn &apos;t know you &apos;re a vampire .
you get as close as you can .
and kill him .
connor , we can end this right now .
just put down the gun and come with me .
sure , come out . i &apos;ll hand the gun over .
think about this , no one has to die .
i &apos;ll tell you everything you need to know .
i don &apos;t make deals with vampires !
listen to me .
if you die right now ,
then your whole life , all that killing ,
it will all be for nothing .
i can give you the truth .
put down the gun and let jeremy go .
please !
don &apos;t hurt him .
come any closer , he &apos;s dead .
elena , get out of here .
he &apos;s the only family that i have left .
just--just let him go .
you hear that ? your girl &apos;s watching .
i will shoot the boy right in front of her !
on the count of three !
1 ...
2 ...
jeremy ?
i &apos;m sorry , i ...
hey , it &apos;s ok .
you don &apos;t have to hide it ,
i know you &apos;re not going to hurt me .
how did this happen , jer ?
why did connor come after you ?
he said i was like him ,
because i could see his tattoo .
his what ?
his hunter &apos;s mark .
it &apos;s invisible to everyone but me .
stefan and damon didn &apos;t tell you about it ?
no .
who else knows about this ?
well , that &apos;s the thing .
i don &apos;t even know .
apparently i was with connor all day yesterday ,
but i can &apos;t remember .
someone compelled me .
i think i know who .
good work , brother .
it &apos;s over , damon , i have him .
not after what i just went through .
i had to punch through a boiler room basement
into a septic tank to get into this stupid tunnel .
but it &apos;ll be worth it .
i &apos;m taking him with me .
that &apos;s the thing-- you &apos;re not .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re up to
or what klaus has over you ,
but even if i have to go through you ,
i &apos;m going to kill him .
better back off , damon .
why ? because klaus wants him alive ?
this has nothing to do with klaus ,
you &apos;re just going to have to trust me on that .
don &apos;t want to .
don &apos;t have to .
not gonna .
you can give him to me , brother .
run as fast as you can .
you &apos;re not gonna kill him !
why are you protecting him ?
tell me .
tell me !
klaus will kill anyone who knows !
then it has to be good . spill it .
spill it !
connor &apos;s tattoo is the key to a cure .
the cure for what ?
for her ! for elena .
klaus told you there &apos;s a cure for vampirism ?
and if connor dies , then we &apos;ll lose it forever .
i know it &apos;s crazy , damon ,
but it &apos;s hope .
do you understand me ? it &apos;s her only hope !
you stay the hell away from my brother !
look at you .
so worried about your brother .
and you &apos;re the biggest monster he &apos;ll ever meet .
you missed .
this isn &apos;t working .
it &apos;s not you .
i just--i can &apos;t get into hypnosis .
bonnie , what do you think we &apos;ve been doing for seven hours ?
that &apos;s crazy .
look , i &apos;m good at this , ok ?
and trust me , you &apos;re doing a lot better
than you were when you came in this morning .
you know what ?
proof .
i bet that you can light this candle
as easily as i can sign my name .
all you have to do is want to .
i &apos;m sorry .
i just--i can &apos;t .
if you can &apos;t ...
it &apos;s only because you &apos;re afraid .
you &apos;re afraid of those spirits
and what they might do to your grams .
but let me tell you something , bonnie bennett .
you &apos;re stronger than they are .
you have a power of your own ,
you haven &apos;t even approached yet ,
and you don &apos;t have to be afraid ,
of anyone .
say it .
&quot; i don &apos;t have to be afraid . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to be afraid .
now close your eyes .
and mean it .
i don &apos;t have to be afraid .
guess it wasn &apos;t good enough .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
elena ...
i need to bury him .
i killed him , i should ...
i should bury him .
hey . hey , come on .
don &apos;t !
i heard you talking to him .
making some secret deal with klaus ?
you said you were going to protect jeremy !
keep me from ... this .
you said that i could trust you , stefan .
elena , it &apos;s complicated .
no , it &apos;s not complicated , damon !
you want to know why ? because ,
because he &apos;s dead now .
you told me to kill him .
so i did .
i killed ..
i killed someone .
i k--i killed someone !
i &apos;m so ... sorry .
i can &apos;t believe dean &apos;s gone .
we could have saved him .
i apologize . am i intruding ?
caroline , it &apos;s not like that .
i keep waiting for you to make up some dumb story
so at least i can call you a liar .
is that now ?
i &apos;ll let you two talk .
thank you , how big of you !
you have to understand ...
no , you don &apos;t tell me what i have to do .
i went through hell when i thought you died .
i cried like an idiot ,
and this whole time , you &apos;ve been keeping a secret from me .
about falling for some werewolf in the appalachians !
i never fell for her .
oh , please .
caroline , she saved my life !
i almost died trying to break the sire bond .
haley was there for me . she helped me get through it .
but nothing else happened !
then why would klaus think that ?
because i &apos;d rather him think that than know the truth .
there are other hybrids that need to be set free .
haley and i can help them .
but if klaus found out about what we &apos;re trying to do ,
he &apos;d kill us all .
hey , jeremy .
sorry we &apos;re so late .
we had to take this crazy detour .
there was a gas leak .
yeah , i heard about that .
yeah , and we had to stop by tyler lockwood &apos;s house .
&apos;cause we had to see caroline .
we talked to her for a little bit .
but now i was thinking
maybe we could all go get some coffee .
but the grill is closed .
that &apos;s ... weird .
you know what , it &apos;s ok . i , uh ,
i need to get home anyway ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m feeling a little ...
over it today .
i should probably get home , too .
all right , then .
hey , uh , april .
did you drop this ?
oh , that &apos;s not mine .
you sure ? here , let me see your wrist .
ah , thanks , but--
i like it . i think it looks good on you .
you should wear it .
ok .
are you ok ?
yeah .
i &apos;m just sick of all the secrets , you know ?
yeah , tell me about it .
what ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
how is she ?
angry , full of guilt .
hasn &apos;t said a word to me
other than she wants to be left alone .
is that my journal ?
had to go through six locks to get it .
needed something to back up your insanity .
did you figure out how to tell klaus
you lost a hunter and a hybrid ?
he &apos;s on a plane .
which means i get to live for another six hours .
i got your back . you know , when he comes to murder you .
thanks . thanks for not saying anything to elena .
about what ?
a cure that we don &apos;t have , can &apos;t find ,
and probably doesn &apos;t exist ? you &apos;re welcome .
she doesn &apos;t need to know
that she killed her chance of being human again .
alleged chance .
i believe him , damon . you didn &apos;t hear klaus &apos; story .
i believed every word he said .
well , i &apos;ll remain a skeptic for now .
so what &apos;s your next move ?
he said there was a brotherhood of the five .
which means there are other hunters out there ,
and i &apos;m just going to keep looking until i find one .
sure , stefan , since you asked ,
i &apos;d be happy to go on a suicide mission with you
for a potentially non @-@ existent cure .
not a problem .
yet a couple hours ago ,
you were ready to rip my heart out .
because you were being a pain in the ass .
i just need one thing .
why do you want to cure her ?
what kind of question is that ?
legitimate one .
you want to cure her because
she &apos;s a vampire and she &apos;s not cut out to be ,
or you can &apos;t love her if she is one ?
i &apos;ll always love her .
but she &apos;s not supposed to be this person .
i don &apos;t want her to be .
well , if i &apos;m going to
ride this fairy tale to its conclusion ,
let me be clear about one thing .
what &apos;s that ?
i &apos;m fine with her either way , brother .
so if we do this , we &apos;re doing it for you .
dear diary ,
today i did the thing i was most afraid of .
i lost control .
i killed someone .
i used to think the worst feeling in the world
was losing someone you love , but i was wrong .
the worst feeling is the moment that you realize ...
you &apos;ve lost yourself .
