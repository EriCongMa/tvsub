watch me make a girl disappear .
kisses , a.
where &apos;s emily ?
hurry up !
two of them ?
help me !
cece !
this is what ali wanted us to see .
there are two payments made to cece drake last week .
maybe &quot; a &quot; paid her to dress up as red coat .
i think &quot; a &quot; is a guy .
it looks like he &apos;s followed her trail to ravenswood .
i don &apos;t like the idea of you guys being there alone .
i &apos;m not waiting for toby .
you need to leave ravenswood .
you &apos;re being watched .
he &apos;s hoping you &apos;ll lead him to alison .
ali &apos;s still alive ?
we &apos;re crashing a party .
what kind of town throws a party in a graveyard ?
must be to honor their dead .
yeah , they can &apos;t do that without walking all over them ?
guys , what if we see &quot; a &quot; before we find alison ?
there &apos;s four of us there &apos;s only one of him .
um , yeah , but that him might be carrying a weapon .
all we &apos;ve got are these 20 @-@ pound hats .
well , i can &apos;t run from the enemy .
this girdle is cutting off my air supply .
it &apos;s a corset .
it &apos;s torture .
people really wore this crap ?
i &apos;m never complaining again about a sports bra .
wait .
i can &apos;t do this .
emily ? we have to get to alison before &quot; a &quot; does .
we can &apos;t back off .
it &apos;s not just &quot; a &quot; i &apos;m scared of .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m ready to see alison .
em , we already have .
come on .
man , people have been croaking in this town a long time .
it happens .
what are those ?
are those fingers ?
they &apos;re mushrooms . aria , get a grip .
hanna ?
hey , stay with us .
wait , hold on .
wait , it &apos;s ezra . he might be worried about me .
just don &apos;t tell him too much .
hey , there .
hey . i &apos;ve been trying to reach you . where are you ?
uh , look , it &apos;s actually not a great time to talk .
i &apos;m standing in a graveyard .
you &apos;re what ?
i &apos;m in ravenswood . but i &apos;ll call you later , okay ?
aria ? you need to be careful .
yeah , i will . i promise . bye .
come on .
got anything to eat ?
gum ? mint ? cough drop ?
no .
i mean , i do . in my car .
you have a car ? why are you on the bus ?
why are you sitting next to me ?
it &apos;s not like it &apos;s standing room only .
well , when i got on , i went to the back .
but the dude in row 26 was creeping me out .
so , i tried sitting next to the driver ,
but he doesn &apos;t have any food and i &apos;m starving .
sorry . i didn &apos;t pack a picnic .
i wasn &apos;t expecting to be on this bus .
yeah , me neither . i had to change in harrisburg .
this freak on the last one was so annoying .
kept telling me he looked like ryan gosling
in certain light .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; dude , carry that light with you ,
because in this light , you look like shrek . &quot;
so , where are you headed ?
ravenswood .
me , too .
you got friends there ?
no , um , family .
but i haven &apos;t met them-- him--yet .
i didn &apos;t even know my uncle existed until two weeks ago .
your parents never--
they &apos;re gone .
gone ?
dead .
so , the creep in 26 fell asleep
and he has a huge bag of chips .
do you think we can get away with stealing them ?
well , unless 60 people get on at the next stop ...
i &apos;d say we look pretty good for it .
yeah .
so , does he know you &apos;re coming ? your uncle ?
yeah , of course he does .
he &apos;s the only family i have .
so , then , who &apos;re you living with now ?
it &apos;s complicated .
foster home ?
you don &apos;t have to say it like that .
you &apos;re not gonna catch something
because we &apos;re sharing a seat .
hey , if there &apos;s something to catch , i &apos;ve already got it .
i &apos;ve spent some time in a few of them myself .
so , um , are you running away ?
i &apos;m stealing those chips .
why would ali come to a party like this ?
who knows ?
maybe it has something to do with mrs. grunwald .
you guys , look .
right over there . do you see him ?
see who ?
the dude standing by himself .
he &apos;s wearing that vintage uniform .
hanna , don &apos;t stare !
do you want me to look or not ?
oh , my god . is that board shorts ?
what do we do now ?
we go up there and ask the scumbag if he &apos;s a.
hanna !
what ? it &apos;s crazy .
we &apos;ve never even seen him before .
why would a total stranger be after us ?
who knows if he &apos;s a stranger to alison ?
or mona ? or jenna ? or melissa ?
he &apos;s not alone anymore .
you guys stay here . i wanna hear what they &apos;re saying .
keep looking for ali .
okay .
names ?
if that &apos;s the creep who &apos;s been messing with ali
and the rest of us , we need answers .
let &apos;s go talk to her .
what are you doing here ?
w @-@ we thought we &apos;d try and find other people in town
who might &apos;ve had contact with ali , or--
or what ?
you need to leave . now . all of you .
what happened ?
he &apos;s a light sleeper .
hanna , why aren &apos;t you answering your phone ?
call me , please .
who &apos;s hanna ?
my girlfriend .
you guys had some kind of fight ?
no . i &apos;m ...
angry at myself
because i let her go there .
go where ?
ravenswood .
you worried she &apos;s hooking up with somebody else ?
no , that is not what i &apos;m worried about .
well , hey , don &apos;t sweat it .
if we get there and both get kicked to the curb ,
we meet on the next bus out .
does your uncle know you &apos;re coming ?
did you at least give him a heads up ?
why ? so he could slam the door shut
before he even opens it ?
i just ... he might want some--
look , don &apos;t worry about me , okay ?
i have other places to go . just worry about hanna .
are you okay ?
oh , i think so .
did somebody push you in there ?
that guy that grabbed you inside ,
did he push you in--
no . that was my cousin .
he &apos;s not the one who &apos;s behind this .
leah !
was is it ? what happened to you ?
she fell . i guess . i was just helping her out .
you fell ?
i told you it wasn &apos;t safe here .
thanks , again .
how could you lose both of them ?
i told you , i got jumped by mrs. grunwald .
what the hell was that ?
hey ? where have you been ?
well , i thought you guys were right behind me .
i thought you were behind me .
well , i was behind two little girls who were freaking me out .
i still haven &apos;t seen their faces .
can we please go back to the tent ?
guys , i don &apos;t think scary uniform
is board shorts .
that &apos;s not his girlfriend , that &apos;s his cousin .
there &apos;s something seriously weird going on in this town .
uh , gee , you think ?
they &apos;re using headstones for barstools .
why were they wearing red coats ?
who ?
those twins .
why do we care ? we &apos;re here to find alison , remember ?
ali &apos;s was the one who told us about that blonde twin
who stabbed her sister--
can we not tell ghost stories
while we &apos;re walking through a graveyard ?
is that ali ?
where did she go ? you saw her , right ?
yeah , we all did .
well , then , where is she ?
okey , i don &apos;t get it .
we are what ? like ten seconds behind her ?
how did &quot; a &quot; get her out of here without us seeing it ?
i &apos;m officially losing this flying saucer .
guys , look .
there &apos;s no leaves there .
yeah .
where does this even go ?
um ... hell ? just a guess .
who did that ?
come on , we &apos;ll find another way .
how ?
this has got to lead somewhere .
well , hopefully it leads to your car .
spence , i want to go home .
okay , breathe .
we &apos;ll find another door .
does anyone else have a signal ?
no . i have minus three bars .
how old is this place ?
where &apos;s that wind coming from ?
there must be an open door somewhere . keep walking .
what &apos;s going on ?
hold on ! get against the wall !
hold on , hold on to me .
what is that ?
god , ow !
hanna , are you ...
where &apos;s hanna ?
she was right behind you , wasn &apos;t she ?
hanna ? hanna ?
where did she go ?
hanna ?
look , i &apos;m sorry .
i was just asking about your uncle because ...
i &apos;ve been there .
you crash into somebody &apos;s life like a cannonball ,
and there might be an explosion .
i &apos;ve got an uncle , too ,
who turned out to be my father .
are you living with him now ?
no .
you know , and if that is what you &apos;re expecting , don &apos;t .
okay , get the picket fence and the bedroom
with your own door out of your head .
i &apos;d settle for someone
who wouldn &apos;t toss my laptop into a steaming bathtub .
were you in it ?
no . not that she would &apos;ve noticed .
she &apos;s the kind who
opens a bottle of vodka and throws away the cap .
well , then this was a good call .
maybe things &apos;ll work out .
at least you know where you &apos;re going .
yeah . back to scranton .
rather deal with the devil i know .
are you sure you wanna do this ?
i mean , you are closer to ravenswood--
look , i gotta go .
but have a nice life .
um , what &apos;s your name ?
caleb .
miranda .
bye .
on second thought .
emily ! god , where are you guys ?
spence , where are you ?
hello ?
oh , my god .
ali ? ali , is that you ?
oh , my god !
come on , come on .
total worth passing the graveyard ,
but i didn &apos;t know you could bring a band .
go ahead , find your girlfriend . i &apos;ll be okay .
you know , i can walk you to your uncle &apos;s house .
the driver said that it was down that street .
no , i can find it myself . you &apos;re late .
to tell you the truth , i &apos;d rather face him alone .
how i &apos;m used to doing things .
yeah , well , you have my number , so ...
you &apos;ve got mine .
let me know what happens .
yeah . promise .
what was that ?
keeps evil spirits away .
never heard that one .
i just made it up .
see you &apos; round the bus stop .
right .
hanna ! can you hear me ?
why did you let go of her ?
i didn &apos;t .
i held on to her the whole time .
until you grabbed a statue .
guys , i didn &apos;t let go of her .
even if she let go , why would she just leave like that ?
she wouldn &apos;t .
what is that ?
a has the both of them , doesn &apos;t he ?
come on .
stupid phone .
this is not happening . this is seriously not happening .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
hello ?
listen to me , i need help ...
hello ?
hanna ?
a door in a crypt
that leads to a tunnel that comes up inside a mansion .
what kind of zoning laws does this town have ?
it could be from the prohibition ,
maybe even the underground railroad .
that &apos;s just rusty water , right ?
they &apos;ll find out .
my friends know i &apos;m here .
ali ?
where did spencer go ?
ah , come on !
ali ?
hello .
hi .
you live here ?
my uncle does .
or , at least , i think he does .
that &apos;s who i was looking for when i found you .
who else lives in this house ?
how should i know ?
well , there were people running in the hall .
you must have seen them .
the only person i &apos;ve met in this house is you . and you are ?
why should i tell you ?
because i &apos;m the one who let you out of the phone booth .
how do i know you &apos;re not the one who locked me in the phone booth ?
you could be from here , maybe you &apos;re trying to kill me .
if i was going to kill you ,
i &apos;d use something better than a phone booth .
my name &apos;s hanna .
hanna . i &apos;m miranda .
okay , this is going to sound crazy ,
but i &apos;ve got one friend in this house
and there are people trying to hurt her .
and i &apos;ve got some other friends who were
trying to save the first friend , but then we all got separated in the tunnel
and now i got locked in a phone booth .
and what &apos;s the crazy part ?
just let &apos;s get out of here and go find my friends .
okay .
you do know how to get out of here , don &apos;t you ?
i mean , you got in , you came through a door .
i got a little lost . can &apos;t we just get out the way you came in ?
not a good idea .
well , i came this way . i think .
you always dress like prom night on the titanic ?
what kind of business did you say your uncle was in ?
i didn &apos;t .
henchly , trumble , and collins .
that &apos;s my uncle . the last one , collins .
come on .
miranda , come on . no window shopping .
don &apos;t try to understand , miranda .
not now .
just know , you &apos;ll be safe .
that &apos;s what your parents wanted .
and , please , forgive me .
are you okay ?
yeah ,
i think so .
i told people i wasn &apos;t at my parents &apos; funeral
because i didn &apos;t want to talk about it .
i guess i said it so often , i started believing it myself .
but ...
i was there .
and i remember a man .
i think he was my uncle .
but if he was there , then why did he leave me ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll tell you what , when we get out of here , and we find him ,
and i &apos;ll hold him down while you ask him . deal ?
yeah .
come on .
i told you i felt fresh air .
do you remember climbing up any stairs ?
i &apos;m lucky i remember how to breathe .
we can climb down the trellis .
what , and just leave them here ?
no , and get help . lots of help .
what are you going to tell people ?
that a maniac has our dead friend who &apos;s really alive ,
or maybe we could come up
with something a little more believable ,
like we &apos;re trapped in a haunted house ?
think of a really good lie on the way down .
okay , i could almost jump from here .
be careful .
you can &apos;t keep me here !
hello ?
ali ?
miranda ?
for a guy who &apos;s looking for somebody , you &apos;re not easy to find .
i didn &apos;t know i needed to be . you okay ?
um , we can talk about me after .
but right now i think your girl needs a hug .
i &apos;ve been trying to call you .
hanna , is everything okay ?
what &apos;s going on ? where is everybody ?
i lost them ...
and i think a has ali .
oh , my god . oh , my ggod .
spencer , wake up .
spencer .
oh , my god .
a &apos;s here !
it &apos;s okay , you &apos;re safe .
are you okay ?
where is he ?
okay , i know it doesn &apos;t look like it , but this is a door .
why am i doing this alone ?
are you sure we &apos;re in the right place ?
miranda ? are you okay ?
that &apos;s me .
help me !
please . he &apos;s going to kill me !
help me !
please .
you shouldn &apos;t be in here .
you found the tunnel .
we followed alison .
so , she was here .
is this--
the house is my home , it will never belong to me .
i &apos;m merely its caretaker .
and this room , it &apos;s your ... office ?
a space with no distractions opens the lines of communication .
so , that was one of your sessions .
six months ago , this tape was stolen .
what is it ?
what did you see ?
it &apos;s not what i see ...
it &apos;s what i feel .
one of you has been touched
by the one alison fears the most .
i found it in my uncle &apos;s house .
there has to be some explanation .
like a brother , or something .
it said i had no living relatives .
yeah . yeah , we &apos;ll meet you at the car .
hanna ? are they okay ?
yeah , they &apos;re all okay , but we lost ali . again .
could this night get any worse ?
i &apos;ll get the spare .
one of us knows how to change a tire , right ?
and you &apos;re looking at me &apos; cause i &apos;m gay ?
no . you just happen to be the sporty one .
so , guys , i think i &apos;ll peel off here .
no !
you don &apos;t have to stay here , you can come with us .
you &apos;re allowed to bring home strays ?
i &apos;ve done it before .
thanks for the offer , but i can take care of myself .
been doing it for a long time .
caleb , help me out here .
you can &apos;t let her go back in that house .
look , i know how it feels to want answers .
and i hope you find the ones you &apos;re looking for .
come on , guys . get outta here already .
it &apos;s an open invitation .
you can always come to rosewood .
thank you .
bye .
god , i really don &apos;t think we should let her stay here .
you heard her . it &apos;s not about wanting answers ,
it &apos;s about needing them .
damn it .
what was that for ?
for being the kind of guy i can ask to stay here
and take care of a girl that pretty .
are you sure ?
yeah .
help her go find her uncle .
then find me when you get home .
i love you , hanna marin .
you &apos;re not leaving , are you ?
not tonight .
i don &apos;t believe this .
they must have taken out the spare
when melissia and i got into that accident .
where &apos;s caleb ?
uh , he &apos;s taking care of a friend .
all right , well let &apos;s just figure out
what we have to do to get out of here ,
because i don &apos;t want to spend another minute in this town .
who is that ?
ezra ?
i &apos;ve been calling , but you didn &apos;t answer .
i was getting worried .
flat tire ?
yeah , and she doesn &apos;t have the spare .
well , it &apos;s late . why don &apos;t i give you guys a ride home ?
sold .
well , come on , spencer . we &apos;ll just send someone
for your car tomorrow , okay ?
alison ?
alison ?
did you miss me ?
it was you , wasn &apos;t it ? in ravenswood .
look , i don &apos;t have much time .
it &apos;s still not safe for me to be here .
ali , don &apos;t leave again .
look , i wanna come home , but you have to help me .
why ? who are you afraid of ?
remember what i told you in the hospital , hanna ?
that was really you ?
aria ?
you forgot your cell phone .
have you noticed how many kids are buried in this cemetery ?
caleb ? what &apos;s your last name ?
rivers . why ?
