aloha .
aloha .
i see you met brittany .
i see you haven &apos;t changed .
shoot me if i ever do .
god , it &apos;s good to see you , steve .
been too long , man .
come on , sit down .
put your dogs up .
i &apos;ll buy you a drink .
so , uh , i hear you &apos;re running some kind of a task force now .
glad to see your talents haven &apos;t gone to waste .
same goes for you , pal .
looks like the private sector &apos;s paying well .
yeah , well , after 25 years in navy intel ,
it was either hang a shingle
or buy a rocking chair ,
so ... i hung a shingle .
that &apos;s why i came to see you , mick .
i want to hire you for your services .
i need a full surveillance package on this target .
who is she ?
it &apos;s my mother .
kid , you don &apos;t need a p.i. ,
you need a therapist .
trust me , she &apos;s not your average mom .
she &apos;s a former government agent .
she disappeared from my life 20 years ago
because of an assignment , now she &apos;s back ...
says she &apos;s changed .
i don &apos;t believe her .
she goes dark a few hours every day .
she racks up too many miles on the odometer .
i want to know what she &apos;s up to .
well , why come to me ?
you &apos;ve got the resources to handle this .
no , i don &apos;t want my people involved .
besides , there &apos;s no one better than you
at recon and surveillance .
full surveillance package means i &apos;m on her 24 / 7 .
that &apos;s audio , stills , video ...
good chance i &apos;ll see your mother naked .
okay , you know , i didn &apos;t need to know that .
just saying . just saying .
mcgarrett .
on the way .
name is thomas hoapili , 46 years old ,
ran a local wholesale fish market ,
widowed , one daughter--
maggie hoapili , 21 years old ,
lives in miliani .
all right , what about the witnesses in the other car--
they see anything ?
all they saw were two people in hoodies
put three slugs in our vic
before dumping the weapon and fleeing the scene .
max confirms that was the cause of death .
okay , so thomas was alive before the accident .
question is , what was he doing in the trunk ?
maybe a kidnapping gone bad ?
no , why kill your bargaining chip ?
no , he &apos;s right .
if this was a k and r ,
shooters would &apos;ve fled the scene ,
picked up thomas another day .
what else do we know ?
uh , we ran the car they were driving ;
it was reported stolen two days ago
from a rental car company at honolulu international .
hpd &apos;s processing .
okay , what about the murder weapon ?
it is a smith &amp; wesson .45 .
fong &apos;s working his magic right now .
all right .
this accident happened two blocks
away from the h1 on @-@ ramp .
i &apos;m thinking these guys were trying to get out of town ,
drive him to a remote location ,
kill him there-- this was an execution .
so fong ran ballistics on the murder weapon
and pulled a partial print .
says he &apos;s got something we need to see .
hey , charlie , what do you got ?
that partial i pulled got a hit in afis .
who is it ?
i &apos;ll show you .
you &apos;re not gonna like it .
kamekona ? !
look , i got nothing to do with this .
i loved thomas .
he was my cousin .
i gotta go see maggie ...
hey , hey , sit down .
chin and kono are going over there .
right now you need to tell us what &apos;s going on .
i don &apos;t know . i swear .
look , thomas and i , we was tight .
he the only was waiting for me
when i got out of halawa .
only one believed in me when nobody in the family would .
gave me money to start my first shave ice stand .
i owe him everything .
you guys are sweating the wrong guy .
okay . that &apos;s fine .
but you got to explain to me why your prints
are all over our murder weapon .
killers must &apos;ve took it from thomas--
a gun that i gave him .
you ... you gave him a gun ?
for protection .
protection from what ?
he didn &apos;t say .
ah , see , i don &apos;t believe that .
it &apos;s the truth .
my cousin needed help ,
i help him .
that &apos;s the way it works .
you understand that , steve .
you do know that trafficking in illegal firearms ...
all right .
you think of anything else ,
you give us a call , all right ?
absolutely .
you gonna get in the car ?
no , i &apos;m not gonna get in the car
until you tell me what is going on
in that goofy head of yours .
excuse me ?
the , uh , shrimp king knew something
and you just let him go .
that &apos;s right .
why ?
trust me .
goofy head , huh ?
stop gloating and drive . let &apos;s go .
go , go , go !
you &apos;re following me .
no , i wasn &apos;t .
oh , really ?
well , i suggest you try something
with a little more fiber ,
because , clearly , you &apos;re full of crap .
okay , all right , all right , all right , guilty as charged .
i was just
looking for an opportunity to say hello .
what , were you gonna ask my help deciding
what cantaloupes are ripe ?
close , close .
actually , it &apos;s grape related .
i was ... i was going to ask for a wine recommendation .
ah , wine recommendation .
you look like the kind of woman
who appreciates the finer things in life ,
and so i ask you ,
which of these do you think goes better
with a grilled branzino ?
all right , branzino is a fish ,
so you &apos;re gonna want to go with a white ,
not a red , and i got to say ,
that is probably the worst pickup line i have ever heard .
oh , well .
can &apos;t blame a guy for trying .
all right .
let &apos;s make a deal .
you take me out to lunch ,
and i will tell you everything i know about wine pairings .
gun ?
what ...
why did my father need a gun ?
we were hoping you could tell us .
can you think of anyone who might have wanted to hurt him ?
no .
everybody loved him .
my father didn &apos;t have any enemies .
was he doing anything unusual ?
anything out of the ordinary ?
nothing was out of the ordinary when it came to my dad .
what do you mean ?
he had a routine .
you could set your clock by it .
monday through saturday ,
he opened this place 4 : 30 in the morning ,
closed at 9 : 00 at night .
then it was dinner ,
whatever novel he was reading ,
then off to bed .
sunday we went to church ,
and tuesday nights , we &apos;d go hit golf balls
at the ala wai driving range .
and what about last night ?
when i left work , he was still in his office .
tell me about this commendation from hpd .
oh , last year someone tried to rob us .
my dad took his gun away and held him
until the police showed up .
was he ever worried about payback ?
do you think that &apos;s why my father was murdered ?
hands on the hood .
get them on the hood .
what &apos;s up , buddy ?
sup ?
i don &apos;t know , you tell me .
wow , now , this is insult to injury .
this guy &apos;s got the guns of navarone .
let me see your hands .
this is obviously not gonna work .
you got a bike chain in the trunk or what ?
thanks , brother . that hurt my feelings .
turn around .
hey , you want to explain this ?
why &apos;d you lie to us ?
i didn &apos;t lie , technically .
what do you mean , &quot; technically &quot; ?
i just wasn &apos;t completely forthcoming .
okay , well , now &apos;s your chance to , uh ,
be completely forthcoming .
this lolo , quentin thorne ,
tried to rob my cousin last year .
thomas got him put away .
he was thinking his brother , eddie ,
was looking for revenge .
well , why would thomas think that ?
he seen eddie hanging around the fish market
the last few weeks .
why didn &apos;t he just call the cops ?
he did . cops told him
if eddie doesn &apos;t threaten him ,
there &apos;s nothing they can do .
okay , so what , thomas came to you for a gun ?
i was taking care of ohana .
his daughter , maggie ...
thomas was the only one she had .
now the kid got nobody .
all because eddie thorne got his payback .
all right , so you thought you &apos;d come down here
and get a little payback yourself , is that right ?
no , no , no , i just was gonna scare him ,
make him confess ,
make a citizen &apos;s arrest .
a citizen &apos;s arrest .
that &apos;s good . you know how stupid that sounds ?
in retrospect , yes .
i had to do something .
yeah , but this ain &apos;t it , buddy . okay ?
you do this , you &apos;re gonna end up in prison ,
and we do not want that .
i &apos;m touched .
oh , don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t give me a puppy @-@ dog sad eyes , please .
okay ? you &apos;re not off the hook .
you &apos;re on house arrest till this is over .
i &apos;ve got an island to feed , brah .
okay , then you are on shrimp truck lockdown
till otherwise advised . is that clear ?
like the sweet waters of hanauma bay .
so which one &apos;s eddie &apos;s house ?
second one on the left with all the tacky lawn trolls .
clear .
what do you got ?
i have photography .
i got a logbook .
&quot; pier 38 . &quot;
dates and times last couple weeks .
oh , look at this .
looks like eddie was keeping an eye on thomas ,
working out a good time to grab him .
hey , you eddie thorne ?
seriously ?
oh , dude , you broke chucky .
yeah .
you killed thomas hoapili .
you &apos;re under arrest .
just &apos; cause i had pictures of the guy
doesn &apos;t mean i killed him .
no , i guess not ,
but thomas did put your brother , quentin ,
in prison and revenge is a pretty strong motive .
yeah , you &apos;d be right if i gave a damn about my brother .
dumb punk deserves to be in jail .
that market job was a bad play .
he &apos;s a good liar , too . that &apos;s a survival skill .
you &apos;re gonna need it when you get to prison .
i &apos;m not going down for this murder .
you don &apos;t get a vote .
look , man , i was just trying to rob the guy .
&apos;cause it went so well for your brother ?
quentin liked to stick up convenience stores for pocket change .
that market did big money .
some of those tuna go for six figures .
quentin was out of his league .
he didn &apos;t have a plan for that job , i did .
so you did your homework .
yeah , you &apos;re damn right i did .
i cased that place for weeks .
i clocked every move hoapili made .
if he hadn &apos;t got himself killed ,
i &apos;d be set for life .
i got something you need to see .
okay , so maggie said her father was still at work
when she left last night , right ?
so i pulled the footage from a security camera on pier 38 .
now , that is thomas hoapili .
notice the time stamp .
he closed up shop at 9 : 15 .
but that &apos;s not eddie thorne , is it ?
no , i ran matrix ; he &apos;s too tall .
the other perp is a female .
brown hair ; five foot , seven .
i got a better look at her .
their vehicle matches the stolen rental from the crash site ,
and both perps match our witness description .
chin , run that back .
thomas is empty @-@ handed .
the other two never go back into the store to grab anything
after they take him down .
this wasn &apos;t a robbery .
all right , the crash happened at 2 : 43 a.m. , right ?
that &apos;s right .
well , this is time @-@ stamped 9 : 15 p.m.
so what happened in the five and a half hours
before thomas turned up dead ?
mmm . this was a great choice .
from now on , i only drink pinot noir
from the willamette valley .
well , the best pinots are from burgundy ,
if you can afford it ,
but give me a smooth , inexpensive
oregon pinot any day of the week .
you really do know your wines .
i do .
lucky i bumped into you .
well , likewise .
here &apos;s to , um , what , uh , your hawaiian vacation .
thank you .
what &apos;s so funny ?
uh , no , i just , um ,
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m actually dining with royalty .
do they really call you the fabric king of ohio ?
fabric is my life .
for fabrics , drapes , upholstery
there &apos;s only one real place to be .
the one and only fabric king
of ohio , give us a ring .
oh , god , that &apos;s just awful .
i know , isn &apos;t it ?
but that little jingle
has kept my family in business for over 75 years .
so , enough about me .
i want to know about you .
what , you mean
when i &apos;m not making wine recommendations ?
yeah , yeah , what do you do ?
how do you spend your days ?
well , i was a schoolteacher .
retired now ,
and after 25 years of chalk dust , uh ,
i prefer to spend my days outdoors .
that explains your extraordinary figure .
okay , i think you &apos;ve really had a little too much to drink .
no , no , no , it &apos;s just my midwestern honesty .
oh , that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s got to be it .
sorry .
oh , it &apos;s just ...
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s the factory ; i got to take this .
one of the looms is on the fritz .
oh , the looms , yes .
sorry , excuse me .
absolutely .
yeah ?
hey , what &apos;d you find ?
nothing .
subject left the house at approximately 10 : 30 .
took a walk on the beach .
got her nails done ;
french tips , by the way .
as far as i can see , she &apos;s got nothing to hide .
i told you she &apos;s good , okay ?
you want to find something , you got to dig deeper .
well , it &apos;s your dime , kid .
if my shovel hits something , i &apos;ll call you .
yeah , okay , good .
problem ?
no .
then why are you staring at me ?
you hired somebody to run surveillance on your mother ?
okay , i know what you &apos;re gonna say .
well , what am i gonna say ?
that hiring somebody to spy on their mother
is the act of a crazy person .
uh , yeah , i would &apos;ve used different words like ,
uh , &quot; whack job &quot; or &quot; psychopath . &quot;
&quot; crazy &quot; works , though . it works .
yeah , i had no choice , danny , okay ?
have you ever tried speaking to your mother
like a ... like a human being ,
like normal people do ?
what am i going to say ?
&quot; mom , i know you &apos;re running
&quot; a covert op . what is it ? &quot;
yeah , that would work .
oh , okay .
look , if she &apos;s in the game , why don &apos;t you confront her ?
right ? i mean , don &apos;t bring in an outside source .
she finds out that her son put a tail on her ,
i promise you ... i promise it will end badly .
it &apos;s not going to end badly .
this guy wrote the book on surveillance .
my mother is never going to see it coming .
how are the looms ?
oh , just weaving away .
good . good to hear .
oh , i hope you don &apos;t mind , i took the liberty
of ordering another bottle of wine .
well , if i drink any more wine , i might do something i regret .
i hope so .
i confirmed the c.o.d. was multiple gunshot wounds .
however , it &apos;s what happened to mr. hoapili
prior to being shot that &apos;s quite interesting .
take a look .
a shattered jaw , six broken ribs ,
signs of internal bleeding
and a fractured sacroiliac .
that would be a joint in the pelvis .
i knew that .
no , you didn &apos;t .
you didn &apos;t know it , either .
okay , uh , if you two are finished ,
i &apos;d like to continue .
max , could all of this have been a result of the accident ?
no . the trunk never sustained any damage due to the crash ,
so mr. hoapili suffered his
extensive trauma elsewhere .
okay , so he was picked up ,
he was beaten , dumped in the trunk like this .
that would be correct .
and the extent of his injuries , left unattended ,
would have killed mr. hoapili ,
whether or not he had been shot .
and then there &apos;s this .
these cuts and contusions on his knuckles
are defensive wounds .
quite severe .
which can only mean one thing .
thomas was in a fight .
not just a fight , but the fight of his life .
glad to see you &apos;re
following steve &apos;s orders and staying put .
i took it to heart .
working is therapeutic .
otherwise , i let my emotions get the better of me .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you hungry ? i can whip some of these up for you .
no . i &apos;m good . i &apos;m good .
i could use your eyes on something , though .
you recognize them ?
i might if you had a better picture .
i wish i did .
these the two that killed my cousin ?
right now they &apos;re suspects .
mind if i keep that ?
show your suspects to my people ?
sure .
but you got to promise
to call us first if you get a name .
i learned my lesson , sistah .
i promise .
okay .
take care , kame .
yeah , chin .
you remember when maggie told us
she and her father went to the driving range ?
yeah , tuesday nights ?
yeah .
i had hpd canvass all of thomas &apos;s known associates .
the owners of ala wai golf say
they haven &apos;t seen thomas and maggie there in years .
kono , if maggie lied to us
about hitting golf balls with her father ,
i wonder what else she told us that wasn &apos;t true .
yeah .
okay , the albacore &apos;s coming in later this afternoon .
maggie , can we talk to you for a moment ?
do you have any news ?
what was your father really doing tuesday nights ?
what are you talking about ?
he wasn &apos;t hitting golf balls .
what was he really doing ?
uh , would you guys give us a minute ?
thank you .
it would save us a lot of time
if you told us the truth .
i can &apos;t tell you .
look , maggie ,
i know all about wanting
to protect the reputation of your family ,
but if your father was mixed up
in something that got him killed ,
you need to tell us now .
you know nothing about my father .
you covering for someone else ?
if you don &apos;t tell us ,
we &apos;re going to need to bring you in
for impeding a homicide investigation .
all right , if that &apos;s the way you want to play it ,
that &apos;s fine by me .
you can &apos;t do this .
watch me .
maggie , what is so important
you &apos;d risk going to jail ?
i told you i have nothing to say .
all right .
well , if you &apos;re not going to talk to us ,
maybe you &apos;ll talk to someone else .
mags .
uncle .
maggie , i know what you &apos;re feeling ,
cause i &apos;m feeling it , too .
but you have to cooperate with these people .
you need to trust them .
they &apos;re only here to help us .
maggie , your father was beaten
within an inch of his life .
if you want to protect the people who did this ,
go right ahead .
you told me my father was shot .
he was , but that was after
somebody used him as a punching bag .
no . it &apos;s impossible .
the picture doesn &apos;t lie .
no one could beat my father that way .
he was the best .
best ?
best at what ?
whatever you know ,
please tell these guys .
have you ever heard of kapu kuialua ?
lua .
it &apos;s the ancient hawaiian martial art ,
primarily hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat .
what &apos;s that got to do with your father &apos;s murder ?
my father was an olohe ,
a lua master ,
and i &apos;m his student .
why didn &apos;t thomas ever tell me ?
we kept it secret .
my father grew up believing it was huna .
the practice was outlawed by the colonial powers
because they felt threatened by it .
some traditionalists still believe that
training should only be done in secret ,
and only by native hawaiian men .
well , if only by men , then how did you get involved ?
my father wanted to pass on his legacy ,
and i &apos;m an only child .
he made me swear
never to tell outsiders what we were doing .
for eight years , he trained me secretly .
let me guess--
on tuesday nights .
you said &quot; outsiders . &quot;
so , who were the insiders ?
my father didn &apos;t just train me .
there were others .
how many ?
he trained about two dozen men
on his compound out in waimea .
maggie , what are you doing bringing these people here ?
shane , just hear them out .
mr. kawano , i &apos;m lieutenant chin ho kelly .
this is officer kalakaua , five @-@ o.
we &apos;re here to investigate the murder of thomas hoapili .
thomas hoapili wouldn &apos;t want you here .
this is private property . you &apos;re trespassing .
this is my family &apos;s property . these officers are welcome here .
they need our help .
for my father , please .
before thomas was shot , he was in a fight .
in fact , he was almost beaten to death .
do you recognize either of them ?
no . i &apos;m sorry .
can you think of anyone
who might have wanted him dead ?
i &apos;ve run this pa lua for thomas for nine years .
in all that time , i &apos;ve never known him
to have any enemies , especially among the haumana .
it &apos;s what i told you .
thomas wasn &apos;t just a lua master ;
he was our patron .
he allowed us to use his land .
his money paid for our classes .
we looked up to him .
doesn &apos;t mean that someone here didn &apos;t have a motive to hurt him .
no one could match my father &apos;s abilities .
no one here would lay a hand on him ,
because no one could .
well , someone did .
and if anyone here was in a fight ,
there &apos;d be signs of injuries ,
so we &apos;re going to have to check everyone .
starting with you .
hey . i just got off the phone with chin .
he just finished a visual examination
of all the students , looking for trauma .
he also ran alibis .
doesn &apos;t look like any of them
had anything to do with the murder .
guys .
whoa , whoa . what are you doing ?
thought i told you to stay put .
i got something .
showed the fuzzy picture around
and got the girl &apos;s name : kat carrigan .
who is she ?
ex @-@ mma fighter
with mad skills in muay thai .
got herself banned from legal competition
for all sorts of rule violations .
got her .
kat carrigan . according to tsa , she arrived
on the island two days ago from bangkok .
clear .
check this out .
his name is ramsey pollock .
flew into oahu two days ago .
same flight as kat carrigan .
what do we know about him ?
he &apos;s american , 33 years old .
he was the former mma heavyweight contender .
he &apos;s proficient in six different martial arts ,
and he lives most of the year in brussels .
well , looks like pollock &apos;s been racking up
some serious frequent flyer miles .
the past four months , he &apos;s been in six different countries ,
including russia , colombia
and , most recently , thailand .
according to authorities , he is suspected
in all of those countries of running illegal fights .
now , these are high @-@ stakes underground bouts
where wealthy fans pay big bucks to sit ringside .
there &apos;s no rules , there &apos;s no refs .
people die .
this guy &apos;s also got a reputation
for defeating every style of fighter
that he &apos;s ever gone up against .
unfortunately , every time law enforcement
gets close to bringing him down , pollock disappears .
of course , no witnesses ?
right .
well , what &apos;s the first rule of fight club ?
you do not talk about fight club .
no , nobody &apos;s talking about it ,
but people are paying top dollar
to sit ringside at these fights .
i just ran pollock &apos;s financials .
26 wire transfers in the last 48 hours ,
each for 100 grand .
that &apos;s almost $ 2.5 million .
so , looks like pollock brought his fight club to oahu .
okay , so he comes here ,
he kidnaps thomas hoapili , forces him onto the fight card .
now , if pollock fought every other type of fighter and won ,
he needed to up the ante .
offer the fight fans something worth paying for .
and fighting an elusive lua master ,
now that makes it a hot ticket .
but then why stick around ?
i mean , after that car crash ,
pollock would be an idiot not to flee the island .
ah , but maybe pollock and thomas was just the undercard .
what are you talking about ?
pollock just wired half a million dollars
into kat carrigan &apos;s account , just this morning .
so , what , payment for helping him grab thomas ?
either that or a purse for another fight .
well , two underground fight nights are certainly
more profitable than one .
so if our vic was the undercard ,
maybe carrigan is the main event .
i think we might know who her opponent is .
hello ?
maggie , it &apos;s lieutenant kelly .
where are you ?
steve .
it was pollock and carrigan .
security cam confirms it .
i already called in the vehicle .
kono pulled pollock and carrigan &apos;s phone records .
20 international calls made in the last three hours .
she cross @-@ referenced the numbers with tsa ,
got names and passports .
bunch of rich guys
flew in on private jets . according to tsa ,
they &apos;re still here .
you were right .
there &apos;s a second fight .
hey , guys ?
did you find them ?
i &apos;m still working on that .
but i just found four calls to a local number
on pollock &apos;s call log .
they all go to shane kawano .
why the hell &apos;s he talking to our killer ?
every fight needs a promoter , right ?
shane ,
what &apos;s going on ?
your father gave me no choice .
shane .
after all he did for you ?
you son of a bitch .
he treated you like a brother !
i gave my soul to that school ,
but i was always still in his shadow .
that &apos;s the way he liked it .
what are you talking about ?
i went to him .
i showed him what we could do .
the money we both could make .
how we could open the school to outsiders ,
teach them .
so you had him murdered because he wouldn &apos;t exploit lua ?
because he wouldn &apos;t sell out ?
is that it ?
your father was an extreme traditionalist .
he was living in the stone age .
and when you inherited his mantle ,
you would have been as stubborn as he was .
but with us out of the way , you could just cash in .
you &apos;re the one who killed my father .
save your strength .
gonna need it .
it looks like they &apos;re consolidated in diamond head .
446 alapali place .
