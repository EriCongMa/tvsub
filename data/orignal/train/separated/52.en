It's about Alicia.
That's what you care about more than anything.
Peter helped you change your name
at the State's Attorney's Office when you worked there.
Peter helped you change your name.
And you slept with him.
You're wrong.
That's good,
because I told the ASA,
and of course, you know, they have their process.
They'll probably... probably interview everyone involved,
and they'll get it all straightened out.
See you around, Kalinda.
Hey. What happened?
Did you see Blake?
Yeah.
What did he say?
Kalinda?
Nothing. Just...
Just the usual.
I, um...
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Alicia, where are you?
Home. Why?
Do you want to talk?
No. I'll, um...
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
Yeah, it's me. What?
Cary?
Kalinda?
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm making an omelet. What do you think?
Where are you?
I need some help.
Okay. Now?
Did you see Blake today?
I mean, no. Why?
He said he was interviewed by an ASA.
Do you think you might know who that is?
No.
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Childs doesn't have a case anymore,
and Blake is AWOL.
Cary, I think Blake might have something on me.
And I think he might have told it to an ASA.
Can you find out?
Sure. What does he have on you?
Can you find out?
Sure.
Thanks. Bye.
So you think he's well?
I believe that,
based upon a reasonable degree of medical and psychiatric certainty
that he is no longer in need of any mental health services,
inpatient or outpatient.
You do know that he tortured,
raped and killed Mallory Cerone?
I do.
Mr. Bowes was unwell
when he committed that crime 30 years ago.
He was found not guilty by reason of insanity
and committed to a psychiatric treatment center,
and not to a prison.
Didn't know you'd be here.
I didn't know I would, either.
Couldn't stay away.
For 30 years, he has been treated.
I can say without hesitation,
he is a different man than the man who committed that crime.
Oh, you mean, when he did this?
Don't look.
I've seen them before.
You don't understand.
These photos are indeed horrifying.
But they were committed by an insane man.
This is the woman he tortured and killed.
I know.
And did you know her daughter is in court today?
I did not know that.
I'm sorry... I know it's hard to hear,
but justice has been done here.
The man who killed your mother no longer exists.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
He's out in a week.
So now it's up to you guys. Keep him from getting rich.
We'll do our best.
Uh, hey. Alicia,
tell Kalinda to stop worrying about the grand jury.
I'm not finding Blake did any more interviews,
so there shouldn't be any more subpoenas.
Okay.
Good to know. I'll tell her.
Are you considering a divorce, ma'am?
Do you think your husband should resign his congressional seat?
Please. I need to get my baby home.
The congressman's wife has still offered no comment
after months of revelations regarding his affair.
Why are they still in the news?
She should just divorce him and get it over with.
Then people'll stop chasing her.
This is not good.
Why? It has nothing to do with you guys.
Everything has to do with us guys.
Voters are like amoebas.
They suck everything up and don't distinguish.
Is that what amoebas do?
So that's the other woman, huh?
She's pretty.
Of course she's pretty.
Now this story will own the week. You know,
I do have work to get on with here.
Why does America suck?
America does not suck.
People suck.
What, and you think Israel will suck any less?
It'll suck different.
So...
That didn't end well, did it?
There was nothing to end well or not well.
I went for dinner with her. That's all.
I was trying to find out if she was undocumented
when she worked as a nanny for Wendy Scott-Carr.
And she was.
So it was all just a political scheme?
It was information-gathering.
Oh, come on, Dad.
I saw your face. I saw how happy you were.
I have great control over my face.
I can make people believe...
Oh, I'm so sorry. Was I boring you?
I have to go study.
Don't misbehave.
Control that face.
No, it's not her fault.
She's been an American since she was two years old.
Natalie Flores has become a flashpoint
for Illinois illegal alien policy,
which some have decried as the most lenient in the nation.
Drive on out, drive on, now drive on out
And she makes the noises
You need to drive on out, just drive on out
The man heard voices
The girl is alone in the blink of an eye
He tell her to drive, drive, drive
And bitch, don't cry the city's too loud...
And the lyrics were credited to him?
To Jarvis Bowes. Copyright 2010.
The band dedicated the whole album to him.
How is it doing?
Currently number three on the Billboard 200.
And monetarily?
Bowes has $800,000 in royalties coming to him,
but it'll go higher.
Still not a lot.
You should hear from Rhonda.
She isn't interested in the money.
She just wants to stop him from getting rich
from a song about killing her mom.
Yes, I understand her reasoning. What's ours?
This was one of Bond's cases.
It looks good being on the side of angels suing a monster.
It'll draw some attention.
So, what, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress?
Worked in a few other states.
Let's see if it works here.
He got out?
He's being released next week.
And we're ready to go?
Bond had all the "Emotional Distress" Arguments ready.
Okay, but we can't keep carrying all of Bond's cases.
You're signed off?
I'm signed off.
Okay, so Bowes's lawyer will argue
it's his First Amendment right.
And if they lose that, they may go after the song itself;
say it has nothing to do with the crime.
You want us to make sure
that the song is actually about the rape and murder?
Yes, whatever you can get
to connect the imagery to the crime.
We'll never use it, but just in case.
Won't this be fun...
finding clues in bad poetry.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna comment.
About what?
The Colorado congressman and his skinny-dipping girlfriend.
That's why you're here, right?
No.
Eli, come on in.
I don't understand.
Her legal fight for citizenship was complicated by the recent...
situation in the news,
and I don't think her current lawyer is quite up to it.
This is Natalie Flores?
Yes, a De Paul University student.
Actually, ex-student.
Wendy Scott-Carr's nanny?
Yes.
Ex-nanny.
So, do you mind if I ask?
The rumor is that your campaign was instrumental in
exposing her undocumented status.
Yes, well, you know I can't comment on that.
But this has nothing to do with the campaign.
This is something I want handled.
Sure.
I will call her, and offer our services.
Great. Thank you.
One more thing.
I'd rather it wasn't mentioned
that I had anything to do with this.
If the press asks.
No, if she asks.
Okay, good to know.
We value your business, Eli.
You were thinking about running
for a judgeship at one point, weren't you?
I was.
You should think about it again.
Is it perverse? I'm sort of starting to like this.
That is perverse.
Do you see any connections?
Carcass, kitchen sink?
It's all too generic.
Bloody gearshift.
Yeah,
that's one connection.
So Cary checked to see
if there were any more interviews with Blake,
and he said he couldn't find any.
What?
Cary came up to me.
He said, "You should just stop worrying about another subpoena."
Okay.
What happened? Did Blake said something?
No.
You still have that bad feeling: something bad's gonna happen?
No.
Are you happy?
Am I happy?
With your life, your home?
I don't know.
I guess so.
It's like when a storm is over, is it happiness,
or it just a relief?
I don't understand.
We want to help you.
We've been seeing you in the news.
We believe your case has been mishandled.
Natalie, this is Alicia Florrick.
She's worked on other immigration cases.
I've asked her to help here.
We are in a consortium of law firms
who promise a certain percentage
of pro bono hours each year, Natalie,
so we offer you this service free of charge.
Why?
Why?
Because we think we can help you.
When did your parents bring you to the United States, Miss Flores?
1986.
You were two?
Yes.
The problem we're facing is this, Natalie.
You know what the Dream Act is?
I do...
it's a path to citizenship for people like me.
Yes, but its political defeat has made it paradoxically harder.
Politicians are less willing to support the undocumented.
Especially someone like you, with a high profile.
So you're going to need a sponsor
with three years of legal residence.
My aunt filed the I-864 form.
Well, good.
The fact that your case was already in the works
should keep you out of any immediate trouble.
And we'll need you to have a job.
Do you have one at the moment?
I do. Day trading.
Day trading?
Uh, the-the stock market?
Well, currency exchanges, too.
For clients?
A few professors at school.
It's not a lot of money,
but I do offer a fairly consistent 12% return.
Well, I was thinking more like a nanny job,
but that should work, I would think.
You're Peter Florrick's wife.
I am.
Do you know that I used to be Wendy Scott-Carr's nanny?
I do.
It's kind of odd how this is working,
me being helped by your firm.
Yes, it is odd.
Did Eli Gold ask you to do this?
No. Diane did.
So why don't you give me a call
when you get all your documentation together?
Am I being used here?
I don't know, but you know what the best thing to do if you are?
What?
Use them right back.
Hi, Cary.
Um, can you call me straight back? Thanks.
Why do you want to know?
Why do I want to know if you're the last one to interview Blake?
I don't know. I just, uh,
didn't see any interview notes.
Right, 'cause I have them here.
You were out that day, so I talked to him.
Okay. Anything I should know?
I don't know.
Who asked you to ask?
Do we have a problem here?
I didn't think so. I'm just wondering
why you're asking me about a dead case.
Okay. I'm out the door.
You see this is the door, me and me going.
Sorry, man.
It's a tense place around here these days.
Yeah, Baghdad after Saddam.
The point is to survive.
It was a lark.
It was our Guns N' Roses moment.
A very lucrative lark.
Yeah, well, all the best tracks are, aren't they?
It's just a goof.
Kind of the new millennium art.
You know? Collage.
Yeah. Collage from a killer.
Yeah, well, art is art, isn't it?
Didn't Norman Mailer kill somebody or something?
So how did you get the song?
Where are you from, darling?
Nearby. How did you get the song?
From him. The killer.
What's his name? Jarvis?
Jarvis Bowes.
Yeah, he sent it about a year ago from his mental hospital.
Love getting submissions from mental hospitals.
Always open them first.
So what is your accent?
So, he sent you the lyrics?
No, a tape. God-awful stuff.
Sounded like a dying porpoise.
Then when I said I wanted to record it,
he said he wanted to change some lyrics.
Guy's in a mental hospital.
Suddenly he thinks he's Ray Davies.
So, you're gonna stay for the set?
Can I see the tape?
Drive on out,
where no one can see
You drive on out,
under the Christmas tree...
Christmas tree. That's not in the newer version.
Popcorn smell
that won't come off
The bloody cow guard...
Popcorn? Bloody cow guard?
I would call that more than generic.
Where you going?
The scene... see if anything else in the song connects to it.
Hello? Hello.
Hello? Hello!
Phone your sister.
She's just gonna say, go with the public defender.
Then maybe we should go with the public defender.
Just give me one minute, okay, Dad?
Hi. This is Natalie Flores
for Diane Lockhart.
When will she be in?
It's very important.
No. It has to be today.
Okay. Thanks.
Well, considering
Wendy Scott-Carr has outspent us by almost two to one,
I'd say, uh, we were the underdog.
I'm sorry, I have to take another call.
I'll call you back.
Hello. Hi, this is Eli.
It's me.
Yes, I know. How are you?
You asked Lockhart/Gardner to help me?
What?
Eli, you were the one
who asked Lockhart/Gardner to help me.
Yes, but it's not what you think.
Eli, I need you to call them.
My father has been arrested and they won't return my calls.
My dad is going to be processed in an hour.
which means that his name
is going to be in the system as undocumented.
Eli, how are you?
No.
I didn't get the message.
Well, actually, can that wait?
I'm a little bogged down.
No, it can't wait. I'm sorry.
Diane, you asked me last week
if I was happy at Lockhart/Gardner.
I am, but I don't want to be unhappy.
She needs your help now.
I'm on my way.
Drive on out,
where no one can see
You drive on out,
under the Christmas tree...
Then what happened?
We receive a call from the burglary with forcible entry.
And you saw Mr. Flores at the scene?
In the vicinity.
There was a report of a Hispanic burglar
with a weapon, driving away.
Then I saw Mr. Luis Flores driving a similar automobile.
A similar make and model?
We're just holding him for questioning, ma'am.
Yes, unfortunately, in a few minutes, dispatch will be
sending his name on to
I.C.E. as undocumented.
Well, that's not under my purview.
I'm investigating a burglary.
It was a different make and model, wasn't it?
Ma'am, you can leave my desk now.
You saw a Hispanic man driving his car
near the burglary scene and you took him in for questioning.
Talk to the judge, because I'm not talking to you anymore.
He is innocent of the burglary, but he will be deported
if you keep holding on to him.
Are you all right?
Yes.
You can go now, if you want.
No, I'm fine.
Whatever this is doing for you, Mr. Gold,
whatever guilt this is satisfying,
you don't have to worry, I'm fine.
Do you see this, ma'am?
This key?
Mr. Flores is now in the system.
Have a good day.
Yep, one court after another... that's my life.
You just behave and everything will be all right.
You're an artist now.
Babette Penn.
Will Gardner.
I like your suit.
I like yours.
How is it representing a killer?
You're not going to be a killjoy, are you?
I might. I'm not sure yet.
He's really nice when you get to know him.
The psycho wants you.
What do you think?
I think you should go.
Hi.
I'm a fan.
Of?
You.
From way back.
The news conference, standing by your man.
I wrote a song about it.
How gratifying.
I'll send it to you.
Oh, goody.
Let's not make this boring, shall we?
What do you suggest? Tequila shots?
You're funny.
No, I'm punting on the First Amendment.
Really?
What's the fun in a Constitutional argument?
You want a quick verdict?
Yeah.
You can bankrupt my client with appeal after appeal,
and my client's song has nothing to do with his past crime.
Well, good luck with that.
Just a warning...
I play dirty.
You know, when I said
we'll never use what you guys are going after...
change of plans.
Based on this, Your Honor,
we ask for a summary judgment of Mr. Gardner's suit.
则可由法官作出即刻的判决或裁决
Just a quick correction for Ms. Penn, Your Honor.
This suit is not mine.
It is Miss Cerone's, whose mother was raped and murdered.
Yes, and unfortunately for Mr. Gardner,
that case was adjudicated over 30 years ago.
And we are now in civil court.
Where you are not objecting on First Amendment grounds.
Because, in the interest of a quick and tidy summary judgment,
we would argue this suit should be dismissed on the facts.
Which, we would argue, should be heard by a jury.
Because you want to inflame the jury's passions against my client.
No, Your Honor, because the facts are persuasive.
As you can see
from these revised lyrics, Your Honor,
Mr. Bowes changed the words in his song
to avoid similarities to his crime.
And those changed lyrics mention an imbedded cow guard,
which you can see in this photo from the crime scene.
Really?
Do you have a minute?
I need to talk to you.
A cow guard? That's the connection
Mr. Gardner is making between my client's song...
The lyrics also make reference to Christmas trees, Your Honor.
And, as you can see, from this map and photo,
within a quarter mile of the crime scene
is the Grayton family Christmas Farm.
Now, Your Honor, we would argue
that Ms. Penn's motion be dismissed
and we continue to trial.
Ms. Penn, do you have anything?
Your Honor, yes, we do.
The Grayton Christmas Tree Farm was not in existence 30 years ago.
Is this true, Mr. Gardner?
Your Honor, we would request a recess to study this.
I checked around on who last interviewed Blake.
And there were no interview notes,
so I thought there was no interview.
But it turns out there was.
Matan Brody interviewed him last.
And what did he say?
Matan?
Yeah.
He said he interviewed Blake last,
and he was keeping the interview notes under lock and key.
Why?
I don't know. He wouldn't say.
Did he tell you what was in the interview?
No.
Did you tell Matan I was the one asking?
No.
Why?
Cary, will you do me a favor?
If you find out anything else,
will you just come talk to me? No one else.
I talked to Alicia because she was your lawyer.
I know.
Don't worry,
you're not gonna get subpoenaed again.
Childs won't come after you again.
Thanks.
They're right.
The Christmas tree farm is only 18 years old.
Okay, we all need to do a bit of musical archeology here.
What is the connection between these lyrics and the crime scene?
And why did he change those lyrics especially?
Kalinda, where are you on this?
Nowhere.
Great. Well, let's get somewhere.
Alicia, call for you.
Thank you.
Hello.
Alicia Florrick?
Uh, yes. Who's this?
You know who this is.
I can tell from your voice you know who this is.
Is this Mr. Bowes?
Yes. I need a lawyer.
Mr. Bowes, you have a lawyer.
And we can't be speaking.
I need another lawyer.
There's a Web site that is dedicated
to illegally downloading my music.
You can be speaking if he waives his rights.
And you want another lawyer to battle illegal downloads?
You're gonna lose tomorrow; the case will be dismissed;
and then I'll need someone to sue over illegal downloads.
Well, I need to remind you that I work for the firm representing
the adverse party in your current dispute,
and I can't talk to you
unless you've talked to your current lawyer.
I already did. She was great.
Why do you stay with your husband?
I don't know.
Why did you change your lyrics?
I'm an artist.
You know, they did spectrograph studies of Fra Angelico paintings,
and they found rough sketches beneath them.
Ah, so you were revising to improve?
I was revising because my life is a revision.
And the Christmas tree, that was just an improvement?
Well, it wasn't the best rhyme, was it?
I guess I shouldn't talk art with a lawyer.
It's up to you.
Art is about personalizing, isn't it?
Lawyers think in terms of the macro, artists the micro.
I see. And what's the micro here?
Ooh. Is this important for our lawsuit?
Our lawsuit against illegal downloads?
You decide.
I want to remake my life...
like you have.
How do I do that?
Well, it would have helped if you hadn't killed someone.
Oops!
I can't change the past, can I?
Once a bad person, always a bad person.
Good-bye.
What do you think?
I think we should be looking to the personal.
I don't know.
There are new lyrics,
but none of them seem to connect with the crime scene.
We were wondering
if they might connect to your mom.
I don't think so.
Nothing with the Christmas tree, popcorn, cow guard?
No, I'm sorry. It was February.
We didn't have a tree up.
And I don't know what the rest of it means.
This is how it'll work.
Your father was swept up in a hunt-and-peck;
a burglary charge targeting
a Hispanic adult, five-foot ten.
There'll be a bond hearing tomorrow,
and he's sure to be released.
The only problem is he's in the system now.
Immigration has been told of his identity,
and he's scheduled to be picked up
along with the other undocumented at 3:00 p.m.
So I need to approach a judge
about accelerating his bond hearing.
Okay. What can I do?
Be at court tomorrow.
Rhonda, hi.
Alicia, hi.
I just realized I can help.
I was in the elevator, and I just realized...
What?
I'm in a group.
A survivor's group. We meet every month.
Children whose parents have been murdered.
There's a woman there: Lynn Boyle.
Her mother was raped and murdered
in 1981 in Poplar Grove.
They never found the killer.
Are you all right?
Yes.
Actually, for the first time in a long time, I am.
Listen, the things you said in the song,
they don't sound like my mom.
They sound like hers.
We always said we'd never talk about this.
You think I want to talk about it?
Then why are we talking about it?
Matan Brody knows.
What're you talking about? No one knows.
There was another investigator at Lockhart/Gardner.
He seemed to have found out, and he told Matan.
Does Alicia know?
No.
It was one night.
There's no way he could have found out.
You know Matan. You hired him.
That's why I think he's not telling Childs.
Childs is a lame duck.
You're saying Matan's wants to see who wins the election?
My guess is he wants to be kept on, if you win.
Okay.
I'll talk to him.
Kalinda...
You know that I love Alicia.
I've fallen in love with my wife again.
It would.. kill her to know this.
I know.
It was another murder.
What?
Rhonda told me yesterday.
The lyrics in the song started to make sense to her,
but not about her mom. Why was your phone off?
What're you talking about?
I tried your cell.
No, no, I mean the song.
Oh. Rhonda is in a survivor group
with the daughter of a woman
named Lynn Boyle.
She was raped and murdered in Poplar Grove.
She was kidnapped from her workplace... a movie theatre.
The popcorn smell?
Lynn Boyle, 28 years old, mother of two.
She was found in the trunk of her car.
She was carjacked and forced to drive off into a field,
where she was raped and murdered.
No DNA evidence.
Some fabric fibers, but they never matched.
When did this happen?
Um... three months before Malory Cerone.
Did anyone ever try to connect it to Bowes before?
Yeah, but it never stuck.
There was nothing of his at the scene.
Kalinda.
The Christmas tree.
We're cutting it close. We have 25 minutes.
We have to get the paperwork to the holding cell, too.
Oh, there he is.
He's here on another case.
Counselor, do we really have to belabor the situation?
Take the two weeks, please?
Thank you. Next case.
Your Honor, we have a quick bond matter
that is time sensitive.
I'm sorry. Is this Hank Christie?
No, Your Honor, but if you would allow us a moment,
I have another case in civil court.
Well, that's not up to me, Ms...
Lockhart.
Ms. Lockhart.
Emily's List, is that right?
It is, Your Honor. Hello.
I had reason to believe he was connected to the crime,
so I pulled him over.
Yeah, but the report stated
that the burglar was between the ages of 18 and 25,
isn't that correct?
Yes.
And how old is Mr. Flores?
Well, he says he's 52.
Officer, I understand the need to widen the net,
but that would seem awfully wide, wouldn't it?
Motion for bond approved.
Thank you, Your Honor.
And if we could process this with some haste.
法官签字
I have a release notice for Luis Flores.
Dad!
Natalia.
That's my client. He made bond, sir.
He's being transferred to I.C.E.
No, the judge just ordered his release. This is a mistake.
That may be, ma'am, but it's not our mistake.
No, sir, please.
My father's done nothing wrong.
He's never even had a parking ticket... please.
It's not about doing wrong, Miss.
He's in the system. It's out of my hands.
It's not out of your hands. You know it's not.
That's just not true, ma'am.
Dad.
I'm sorry.
Don't say that.
I'm okay.
Hey. Tom.
What's up?
Mr. Gold, how are you?
Good. Good.
Haven't seen you at the Sheriff's Association in a while.
Uh, the wife hates those things.
Yeah, the rubber chickens.
So, um, can you help me out here?
Luis is my gardener.
Ah, I don't know, Mr. Gold.
It's I.C.E.
It's I.C.E. When he's out the door.
He could be a material witness in an ongoing investigation.
He could be a material witness in an ongoing investigation.
It's a small gesture.
It would be appreciated.
You can't find good gardeners these days, you know?
Let me see what I can do.
I'm okay, Mijita.
I'm okay.
I think we were almost out of favors in there.
So the lyrics have nothing to do with your crime?
That is correct.
I'm a fan of Elvis Costello and Gerard Manley Hopkins,
and I just wanted to try something
that combined their spirits.
Really?
Really. Did you like the song?
I think I liked the earlier version.
I hate my first drafts.
Everything's in flux, don't you think?
Hmm. And so the Christmas tree you mention in the song...
the lyrics you tried to cover up...
Objection.
Actually, I'm not sure
if I should object to that or just laugh.
You want some help with that?
No, I think I've decided.
You two want us all to leave?
No, Your Honor.
So the reason you changed the cow guard in your song
has nothing to do with the location of the murder?
That's correct.
But you do remember seeing the cow guard?
I don't think I do remember, but, uh,
I'm an intuitive person,
so it's probably in there someplace.
And the allusion to forcing a victim to pull over beside a field...
why did you change those lyrics?
I thought it was melodramatic.
And yet, fairly realistic given how you killed her.
I've tried to block those memories.
So you don't remember how you killed her.
So the song could be based on your crime?
Objection. Leading question.
Overruled.
No.
I remember my crime enough
to know that it's not connected to the song.
Good. So the allusion to the car trunk...
how was that different from the crime?
Well, the song describes how I carried her in the trunk,
which is impossible.
I couldn't have done that because I don't drive a stick.
So you only put her in the trunk after you killed her?
Yes, I...
Go on. You were saying.
Your Honor, could we take a short recess?
You were saying about the trunk.
How you put her in the trunk?
I didn't do that.
Because that doesn't have anything to do with this crime.
Your Honor, please, a recess?
Ten minutes.
It's too bad.
You mixed up the victims.
Leaving many observers wondering
whether this new deal will push the Congressman's wife
even closer to divorce.
The deal for her memoirs is estimated
at one point three million dollars.
I say again... America sucks.
What's wrong with that?
Capitalism at work.
What is it with you youth today
and your disgust for everything capitalistic?
You don't think that's disgusting?
She's selling her pain...
To pay her bills.
It's better than selling her body.
Actually, I disagree.
Selling her body is at least more honest.
Oh, how I love these little chats.
So... I told mom about your little girlfriend.
Thanks.
She called it your campaign palette cleanser.
You always find some crush
in the last month of the campaign to fixate on.
How I love your mom's little pop psychology one-liners.
She said it's 'cause you hate yourself.
There we go.
You need to act as savior to someone,
or you'll have to face the fact you do bad things.
That doesn't even make sense.
In a sort of screwed-up way, it does.
Why are we even talking about this again?
Can't we just sit and enjoy quality time?
She was outside.
What?
You asked why I'm talking about her again.
Because I saw her outside,
and we said hi.
Go to her, Dad.
Go save her.
Uh, hello?
Hi.
I just wanted to say thank you.
That's all.
You didn't need to.
My boyfriend's back from Las Vegas.
I'm just saying that. It's...
It's not a big deal. I'm just saying it.
I'm glad.
No, no, you don't have to...
It's not what you think. I...
Really. This is just a thank you.
Natalie, I know.
I know.
It's just nice to talk, that's all.
I'm too old to have expectations of anything other than talk.
Oh, my God, that sounded terrible.
No. It's okay.
It's really nice talking to you.
And to you.
Goodbye.
Defendant's motion to dismiss is granted.
It was always a long shot.
I know.
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
That's okay, buddy.
If there was any way I could get her back...
Them back.
If there was any way,
I would.
I know you just must hate me.
I hope we can talk sometime.
We have to talk about those illegal downloads.
Sure, when you get out.
Well, haven't you heard?
I am out.
Yeah, I have heard.
Mr. Bowes, you're under arrest
for the murder of Lynn Boyle.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can
and will be used against youin a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney...
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's okay.
You guys just play, and I'll cook.
Mom, it's tied.
Carl, what's wrong with you?!
Well, I kill people, and I eat their hands.
That's two things.
You have to at least make references I understand.
Carl!
Dinner is ready!
Mom, it's still tied. Where's Dad?
Dad, dinner!
No. I just want to make sure.
I'm coming!
Listen, Matan, we've always worked well together,
so, you be good to me,
and I'll be good to you.
Okay.
Beat Wendy.
I thought you liked it.
I thought you liked public school.
I do. I'd stay there.
I just kind of want to see
what other schools are out there, you know?
Where would we move to?
I don't know that we would.
I mean, if we did, maybe just to a bigger apartment.
Not back to Highland Park?
Mom doesn't want to.
I didn't say that. It's expensive.
Isn't the market down?
What, are you following real estate now?
Hey, Dad.
Mom was saying that we might just stay around here,
and not go back to Highland Park.
That's right.
Everything good?
As good as it can be.
Want some pizza?
I do.
