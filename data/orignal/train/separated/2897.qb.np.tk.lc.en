let me just straighten out your helmet there .
thanks , daddy .

all right , it &apos;s all yours .
okay , okay .
there you go , there you go .
wow , bers first big @-@ kid &apos;s bike . this is so exciting !
oh , yeah , i remember mine .
it was my sixth birthday . i went to the park ...
... and i got on it , and it bent .
yeah .
i never had a bike of my own .
what ?
we didn &apos;t have a lot of money .
but the girl across the street had the best bike .
it was pink , and it had rainbow @-@ colored tassels hanging off the handles ...
... and a bell and this big , white wicker basket ...
... with those plastic daisies stuck on .
that sounds like my first bike .
my dad gave me his old one .
did the girl ever let you ride it ?
no .
but she gave me the box that it came in .
it had a picture of the bike on the front .
so i would sit on it , and my stepdad would drag me around the backyard .
that is so unfair .
not really , i got to drag him around too .
the one with all the candy
hey , what are you guys doing ?
making candy for the neighbors .
i &apos;m sorry , who ?
i &apos;m gonna hang a basket on the door .
when the neighbors walk by , they can take a piece .
but we don &apos;t know the neighbors .
i do .
there &apos;s , let &apos;s see , the guy with the mustache ...
... smokes @-@ a @-@ lot lady , some kids i &apos;ve seen ...
... and a red @-@ haired guy who does not like to be called rusty .
oh , i know that guy . he also doesn &apos;t like it when you say :
&quot; back off , howdy doody . i &apos;m engaged . &quot;
you got hit on by firebeard ?
see , this is exactly why i &apos;m making this candy .
we can get to know our neighbors .
wouldrt it be easier if we just moved ?
good morning !
somebody &apos;s in a good mood .
well , why shouldn &apos;t i be ?
i have great friends . i have a wonderful job ...
where you can make out with your assistant .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
we stayed up all night creating a plan so that us dating won &apos;t be a problem .
oh , yeah ? what &apos;s the plan ?
we ... we are not ...
... going to let it ...
... be a problem .
it took you all night to come up with that plan ?
well , you know , we did other stuff too .

oh , i don &apos;t sleep with guys on the first date .
matt wire , mark lynn , ben wise ...

yes , at 4 .

i &apos;d better get back to my desk .
okay , hard worker .
i &apos;ll put that in your evaluation .

you &apos;ve been here for two months now .
and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation .
but you know , there is one thing that i have yet to evaluate .
are you serious ?
no , i &apos;ve just always wanted to do that .
can you help me clean this up ?
i &apos;m excited to see if anyone ate my candy .

well , either that or ...
no . not even joey could eat that much .

they &apos;ve come by all day . they love it .
they love my candy ?
oh , man , i gotta go make more .
hey , mon .
make some more lasagna too . something might have happened to a chunk of it .
ross , the neighbors ate all my candy .
mine stole my newspaper .
it &apos;s like a crime wave .
pheebs , you got a second ?
sure .
ever since you told me about that bike ...
... i couldn &apos;t stop thinking about it .
i mean , everyone should have a first bike , you know ? so ...
oh , my god , ross !
you like it ?
i love it !
yeah ?
oh , oh , god ...
and i love you .
not that way .
but the bike got you a lot closer .
well , take it downstairs .

you &apos;re welcome .

my roommate says they taste like little drops of heaven .
oh , please .
did you hear that ? &quot; little drops of heaven . &quot;
four a . m.
so can i get some candy ?
i am sorry , but some of us have to get up early and go to work .
he does not know that i am not &quot; some of us . &quot;
he can hear me , can &apos;t he ?
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;ll put some out in the morning .
okay , i &apos;ll swing by later .
you live in this building ?
seems like i &apos;d remember you .
night , gar .
is there anybody in this building that does not hit on you ?
smokes @-@ a @-@ lot lady .
oh , wait , that is not true .
so did you read your evaluation yet ?
no , it was marked &quot; confidential . &quot;
i just sent it to human resources .
please , you &apos;re kidding , right ? i wrote that one as a joke for you .
a joke they would appreciate ?
i &apos;m thinking , no .
what did you say ?
i said you were a good kisser ...
... and that i liked your teeny , tiny tushy .
no , not my tushy .
it gets worse .
about your initiative , i wrote :
&quot; he was able to unook my bra with minimal supervision . &quot;
under problems with performance , i wrote , &quot; dear god , i hope not . &quot;
and then ... and then i drew a little smiley face .
and then a small pornographic sketch .
that is so sweet of you to get phoebe that bike .
when i heard the story , i almost cried .
almost cried , huh ?
hear that , chandler ? &quot; almost &quot; cried .
hey , you cry every time somebody talks about titanic .
those two had only each other .
she really likes it , huh ?
oh , yeah . i saw her walking it down the street .
she had these flowers in the basket . it was so cute .
i saw her this morning , walking it by the park .
wait , she was walking the bike ?
both times ?
hey , pheebs .
oh , hi !
hey , so you enjoying the bike ?
oh , so much .
pheebs , you do know how to ride a bike , don &apos;t you ?
of course .
can we see you ride it ?
okay .
see ?
i told you not to get involved with your assistant .
there &apos;s no such thing as a secret when it comes to affairs .
did you hear that , chandler ?
no such thing .
what happened ? i &apos;m just eating candy .
maybe it &apos;s not that bad . they might not take it the way i meant it .
absolutely , you know ? because &quot; tushy &quot; can mean both ass ...
... and good worker .
i just gotta get the thing back .
rach ? that sketch you mentioned ?
might it have looked a little like this ?
oh , my god , joey !
what is the matter with you ?
god !
this little talent came in handy before i could afford porn .
hi , i &apos;m sorry . i know it &apos;s after @-@ hours , but i really need candy .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t help you . see ? rules are rules .
please , i have people coming from out of town today .
i told them all about your candy .
you &apos;re kidding .
out @-@ of @-@ towners , huh ? what did you tell them ?
i told them your candy was absolutely indescribable .
some people have said it &apos;s &quot; little drops of heaven . &quot; but whatever .
please , can &apos;t you help me out ?
hey , chandler , do we know that lady ?
isn &apos;t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud ?
all right , i &apos;ll do it just this once .
but you can &apos;t tell anyone .
please , just give it to me .
yeah , that &apos;s her .
thank you .
unbelievable !
i can &apos;t believe that sign didn &apos;t work .
you know what would work ? stop making candy .
but they like it .
you mean they like you .
maybe .
is that why you became a chef , so people would like you ?
you want to talk about getting people to like you , huh , funny man ?
just remember everything i taught you , and you &apos;ll be fine .
okay ? here we go .
ready , set ...
wait , this seat is really uncomfortable .
maybe before we start we should just get another one .
perhaps like an airplane seat , or a beanbag chair !
you can &apos;t get out of this . you have to learn how to ride a bike .
why ? why do i have to learn ?
well , in case of an emergency .
what kind of emergency ?
well , what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says :
&quot; you ride this bike or i &apos;ll ...
i &apos;ll shoot you . &quot;
i would ring the bell to distract him .
then i would knock the gun away with a chinese throwing star .
okay , phoebe , just get on the bike ...
... and , hey , i &apos;ll hold you up and push you . okay ?
you won &apos;t let go ?
no .
you swear ?
i swear .
okay .
come on .
all right , here we go . all right ?
all right .
all right ?
feel good ? all right , try pedaling .
that &apos;s it , you &apos;re doing great . yes , take control .
yes , yes , yes !
oh , no !
you swore !
i just thought you were doing so well .
i am shocked . shocked !
it &apos;s a legitimate learning technique .
wow .
hey , there &apos;s some people outside asking about candy .
they &apos;ll just have to wait , won &apos;t they ? i only got two hands !
need some help ?
no , you don &apos;t know the system .
i don &apos;t need nobody messing with the system !
by the way , the week before your wedding , you may not see a lot of me .
oh , hello , liar .
look , i &apos;m really sorry i let go of the bike .
i could &apos;ve been killed , you know .
i know , i know .
but can we please try it again ?
i mean , you were so close , phoebe .
well , i would love to ...
... but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects .
phoebe .
what ?
what the hell ?
you know what ?
if you won &apos;t learn how to ride , then i &apos;m sorry ...
... i have to take it back .
what ? why ?
because it &apos;s ...
it &apos;d be like you having this guitar ...
... and never playing it .
okay , this guitar wants to be played .
and this bike wants to be ridden .
and if you don &apos;t ride it ...
... you &apos;re killing its spirit .
the bike ...
... is dying .
all right . if you care enough to make up that load of crap , okay .
great , great .
you &apos;re making the bike very happy .
okay , ross .
please don &apos;t die !
to get the evaluation before they see it ...
... we gotta get into zelner &apos;s office . he doesn &apos;t get in until 10 .
but his assistant , betty , comes in early to eat breakfast at her desk .
that &apos;s kind of sad .
yeah , well , betty &apos;s kind of sad .
which is why i believe i can lure her away with these chocolates .
while i distract her , you go in .
got it .
let &apos;s roll .
hello , rachel . you got a minute ?
yeah , sure , mr. zelner . for you ? anything . minute .
okay , great .
abort the plan .
actually , i &apos;d like to speak to both of you .
okay .
well , can we get you anything , mr. zelner ? maybe some chocolates .
no , thanks , but i &apos;ll give these to betty .
so i read your evaluation of tag .
or to use his full name , tag &quot; sweet cheeks &quot; jones ?
is something going on with you two ?
oh , my god , can you imagine if there was ?
i mean , what would happen exactly ?
well , i &apos;d be forced to file a report .
i &apos;d have to consult with the legal department .
and your future at the company would be in jeopardy .
well ...
mr. zelner ...
i filled in that evaluation .
oh , no ...
yeah , yeah .
i thought it would be funny .
you wrote that you have a cute tushy ?
yes . i have a weird sense of humor .
and i &apos;m kind of strangely proud of my butt .
it &apos;s kind of a risky joke , tag .
what is this drawing ? i can &apos;t figure it out .
it &apos;s upside down , you gotta ... it doesn &apos;t matter .
it &apos;s not like i don &apos;t have a sense of humor .
hell , i even enjoy a naughty limerick every now and then .
there &apos;s a time and a place .
unless you have a limerick right now .
no ? okay . well , you &apos;ve got my fax number .
i can &apos;t believe you did that . that was sweet .
don &apos;t worry about it .
you could &apos;ve lost your job .
are you kidding me ? with this cute butt , i &apos;d find work .
thank you , you &apos;re great .
you know what ?
what ?
i feel great .
in fact ...
what ?
it &apos;s just ... it took me so long to get that desk organized .
i &apos;m sorry .
there it is .
what is going on ?
we &apos;re waiting for the candy . bring out the candy !
yeah , lady , give us candy !
joey !
what &apos;s up , buddy ?
what are you doing ?
waiting to get candy .
get in here .
hey , and you cannot smoke in here .
merry christmas .
the candy is coming ! i need another 15 minutes for it to cool .
all right , everybody , just be quiet . be quiet ! be quiet ! pipe down !
what is the matter with you people ?
this woman was trying to do a nice thing for you , and look at her .
she is a mess .
her hair &apos;s not brushed . she &apos;s got dark circles under her eyes ...
... chocolate on her face , and she is still stunning .
she was making candy so she could get to know all of you .
and i &apos;ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name .
am i right ?
candy lady ?
no , not &quot; candy lady . &quot;
if we know it , can we have candy ?
all right , you know what ?
forget it , you &apos;ve ruined it .
go home . you &apos;ve ruined it .
that &apos;s all wrong ! you guys ruined everything . you ruined it !
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
did you smoke ?
no , smokes @-@ a @-@ lot lady blew smoke directly into my mouth .
are you okay ?
fine , but it was really scary for a while .
someone slipped a threatening note under the door !
oh , yeah . sorry about that . mob mentality or whatever .
i can &apos;t believe it . i did it . i rode a bike !
i never thought i &apos;d be able to do that . thank you .
oh , hey , don &apos;t thank me . thank yourself .
you &apos;re the one who faced your fears and ultimately overcame them .
