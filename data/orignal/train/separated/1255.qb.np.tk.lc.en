noel &apos;s been in the middle
of everything that &apos;s been happening to us .
he stole mary drake &apos;s file .
he burned us out of the storm cellar
and he probably killed sara . noel kahn is a.d.
hello , hanna .
we have a reason to believe
nicole gordon may be alive .
i got you a ticket .
i cashed in our tickets to italy .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
once you get there , you will .
miss dilaurentis , this person that you married
is actually a man named archer dunhill .
he &apos;s wanted in the uk for petty theft and fraud .
i had applied for the coaching position .
&apos;cause i was just , uh , interviewing another candidate .
paige .
i &apos;m marco .
i &apos;m leaving .
i obviously did not know that you are a police officer .
you &apos;re investigating my friend &apos;s husband .
i wouldn &apos;t want anything to get complicated .
okay .
you haven &apos;t told anyone about us , have you ?
no .
you guys are never gonna realize
that noel is the one behind everything .
the deal is on .
i get you the money , you give me the keys ,
and then you forget you ever heard from me .
went to new york to meet lucas for work .
be back in a few days ?
do we really believe that hanna &apos;s in new york ?
well , she and lucas are starting a business together .
but why would she go now ?
she &apos;s the one that &apos;s convinced noel is a.d.
and we &apos;re so close to nailing him .
because all we have is a bunch of circumstantial evidence .
right , which is why we need her here
so we can find something more concrete .
okay , i &apos;m gonna call her and tell her to come back .
did ezra get to colombia okay ?
yeah .
he called when he landed .
any news about nicole ?
the authorities said they rescued four hostages
but ezra doesn &apos;t know if nicole &apos;s one of them yet .
oh , my god , this must be overwhelming for him ..
and for you .
did you get hanna ?
went to voicemail .
一通未接电话
we have every reason to believe that noel &apos;s a.d.
we also know that a.d. burned us out of the storm cellar
so we wouldn &apos;t know the name of mary &apos;s child .
what &apos;re we saying , that noel is that child ?
if we can prove it , that &apos;s the evidence we need .
yeah , and another reason that he would want
to avenge charlotte &apos;s death .
i did some research .
turns out all adoptions of babies born
at radley went through the county family services court .
i &apos;m gonna go to the courthouse when it opens
and i &apos;ll find out what i can about the adoption .
okay , great , i &apos;ll ,
i &apos;ll try to find out where noel lives and works
then maybe i would get some answers that way .
i have my swim coach interview in an hour
so i &apos;ll come back after when i &apos;m done and help out .
okay .
let us know when you hear from hanna .
yeah , i will .
my name is hanna marin .
if you find this video before i finish what i need to do
something went terribly wrong .
please give this to the police .
第七季 第九集
marco ? hi .
hey , you got a minute ?
yeah . of course , come in .
stopped by alison &apos;s to give her an update .
i saw your car outside ,
so i thought i &apos;d say hi .
yeah , she &apos;s away for the day on a school field trip .
i know , jason told me .
well , what &apos;s going on ?
or if you &apos;d prefer , i can ask jason .
no , no , it &apos;s okay , i can tell you .
archer fled to france a few days ago on a fake passport .
france ?
i know that &apos;s not the news
you wanted to hear .
the case is still open but since he &apos;s overseas
it &apos;s shifting out of my jurisdiction .
but there is one silver lining .
what &apos;s that ?
well , since i &apos;m not investigating
your friend &apos;s husband anymore
maybe now you can have a meal with me .
i &apos;m not so sure that that &apos;s a good idea .
it &apos;s just dinner .
maybe wine .
not a marriage proposal .
unless you prefer brunch .
i know this place that just opened--
it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s ,
then what ?
the night that i met you , i was ..
i was just kinda getting out of a relationship
and it was too soon then and it &apos;s ..
too soon now .
i get it .
it &apos;s not the right time .
yeah .
this has my cell on it .
in case you change your mind .
give me a call .
i will .
good .
good to see you .
you too .
someone woke up with a sugar craving .
doesn &apos;t everyone start out their day like this ?
no , we had a customer call and order a red velvet cake
for a special occasion , so ..
i am testing out icing .
which one do you like better ?
姓名 : 诺埃尔 · 卡恩
noel kahn ? that &apos;s your customer ?
yeah , you know him ?
yeah , we went to school together .
he &apos;s bad news , sabrina , please don &apos;t work with him .
well , i &apos;m not gonna be his best friend .
i &apos;m just making him a cake .
yeah , you shouldn &apos;t even do that .
why , what &apos;s he gonna do ? steal my pies ?
write a bad yelp review--
i &apos;m being serious .
i &apos;m trying to protect you .
protect me from what ?
just trust me when i say that he &apos;s dangerous .
okay ? look ,
i can &apos;t talk about this right now .
i have to get to an interview .
you can &apos;t say something like that
and then just walk away .
i know , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll call you later .
okay .
i ran into emily at the brew .
she said you were up here .
yeah , i was actually just about to head out .
can we talk later ?
there was a fire at my aunt carol &apos;s a few days ago .
you know anything about it ?
no .
apparently , ali went out there .
detective furey said archer was out of the country .
but i think he &apos;s still here .
i think he followed her out there
and tried to hurt her again .
the fire was an accident .
wait , so you were with her ?
yeah .
ali asked me not to say anything .
why not ?
we found some of your mom &apos;s personal things in the cellar .
what things ?
okay , we found some paperwork that confirmed
your mom was in charge of mary &apos;s care at radley .
she oversaw charlotte &apos;s adoption .
and mary &apos;s other child &apos;s adoption too .
what other child ?
that was all we were able to read before the fire started .
now , mary won &apos;t answer any of ali &apos;s calls
and she &apos;s , she &apos;s not staying at the lost woods .
i &apos;m sure there were more secrets .
and i &apos;m guessing my mom was killed because of one of them .
i promised ali i &apos;d find out all i could about the adoption .
i owe her that after everything she &apos;s been through .
i was just gonna head to the courthouse right now .
they won &apos;t give you any information .
why not ?
you &apos;re not a relative .
no , but you are .
you okay ?
yeah .
you &apos;re not having second thoughts about applying
because we &apos;re up for the same job , are you ?
i don &apos;t feel great about it , but ...
that &apos;s not the issue .
have you ever been arrested ?
i have never filled one of these things out before .
should i be honest or ...
hackett knows your history .
he wouldn &apos;t have suggested you apply if it was a problem .
i &apos;m just glad they don &apos;t have
a &quot; have you ever committed a crime &quot; box .
my answer would never fit on two lines .
yeah , you probably need four . maybe five .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ve aided and abetted a few of them .
forget about the past .
they need someone now .
you &apos;d make an excellent coach .
you &apos;re a wonderful swimmer and an even better person .
the best i know .
calling number five . number five next
calling number five .
it &apos;s not bad .
not bad ?
from number five .
dmv moves faster than this place .
relax , i &apos;ve been in places where it takes a week
to get an appointment just to talk with the clerk .
here , got this while you were in line .
sugar , dash of milk , right ?
morning .
morning .
thank you .
aren &apos;t you gonna be late ?
my training is done .
i finished yesterday .
three weeks went by fast .
so , what , what , that means you &apos;re ... going back soon ?
next week .
you know , i was thinking
that maybe ... maybe you &apos;d wanna come with me .
to ethiopia ?
what would i do there ?
help people who have bigger problems than we do .
yeah , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s just that traveling &apos;s
not really part of the plan right now ,
i &apos;ve got , like , three job interviews this week .
you just graduated , aria .
you have the rest of your life to work .
and , besides , i think this would be
a great experience for us to share .
yeah . i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sure it would be .
but i &apos;m not independently wealthy .
i kinda need a job .
my charity will pay for you .
and you only have to stay as long as you want .
at least think about it .
yeah , i will .
okay . i gotta go get ready for this interview .
too much sugar ?
no . no , it &apos;s perfect .
hey . how did it go ?
really good , actually .
yeah , hackett saw that some of the girls
on the team have been bullied .
so he thought i &apos;d be an asset to them .
he &apos;s right .
when you going ?
fifteen minutes .
well , i know you &apos;ll do well .
thank you .
hey , was this your old locker ?
no . this one was .
this hallway used to seem so big .
yeah . our whole lives were wrapped up in this place .
i couldn &apos;t wait to get out of here .
now i kinda wish i could go back .
really ?
you miss being stalked
and having acne that won &apos;t go away ?
no , but there are some things that i do miss .
what are you doing later ?
you wanna hang out ?
i &apos;m probably gonna be with sabrina .
i didn &apos;t know you were seeing anyone .
yeah , it &apos;s new .
i mean , she &apos;s really great .
but i &apos;m just starting to think it &apos;s not gonna last .
why not ?
there &apos;s a lot i can &apos;t share with her ..
about my past .
it &apos;s understandable .
and present .
what do you mean &quot; present ? &quot;
emily ?
it &apos;s happening again .
please don &apos;t ask me any questions , okay ?
you found a way to include me when we were in high school .
whoever you &apos;re with now ,
you should be able to do the same .
yeah .
never sold these to a chick before .
glad i could be your first .
i &apos;m sorry .
emily , i got your messages .
no , i &apos;m in a meeting .
i can &apos;t talk now . i &apos;ll call you later .
now , look , little bit goes a long way .
one of those should knock him out for hours .
good to know .
look , the reason that i &apos;m calling
is because my mother wanted me to send out
a thank you note to one of the donors
but i @-@ i &apos;ve , i &apos;ve misplaced the address .
can you look it up in the voter ..
in the voter registration database ?
yeah , the name &apos;s noel kahn . i can wait .
that &apos;s my mom &apos;s campaign manager .
oh , good thinking .
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s a long shot .
he might not even live in the district anymore .
noel isn &apos;t the only one we have to worry about .
i talked to hanna .
and ?
she said she was in a meeting and then hung up
before i could even say hello .
look , i know when hanna &apos;s lying to me
and she &apos;s definitely lying .
well , we should call lucas .
see if he knows what &apos;s going on with her .
yeah , i already did . he hasn &apos;t responded yet .
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m here .
you did ?
great . what &apos;s the address ?
okay , thank you so much .
that &apos;s noel &apos;s parents &apos; cabin .
oh , my god .
what ?
that &apos;s the same area where hanna was held captive .
how did we not put this together sooner ?
well , i thought his parents sold this place years ago .
hey , god only knows what &apos;s inside .
hopefully , the evidence we need to finally end this thing .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m breaking in .
his car isn &apos;t here .
yeah , but what if somebody &apos;s inside ?
only one way to find out .
does that sound remind you of anything ?
yeah , the bunker .
look .
hey , come on .
we have to hurry up .
10名嫌疑人在哥伦比亚被捕
number 67 , number 67 ...
hey , they called our number .
we lose our spot , we &apos;ll be sleeping here tonight .
10名嫌疑人在哥伦比亚被捕
yeah , let &apos;s go .
how can i help you ?
i just found out that my cousin was born
in radley sanitarium 23 years ago .
this court facilitated the adoption .
i don &apos;t know the gender , but i know the birth mother &apos;s name .
how can i get a copy of the adoption records ?
you can &apos;t , you &apos;re not the adoptee
or parent of the adoptee .
i understand , but we don &apos;t know who the father is
and the mother &apos;s nowhere to be found .
i wish there was something i could do .
actually , there is something you can do .
excuse me ?
jason &apos;s mother is dead , his dad disappeared
his other cousin was murdered a few weeks ago
and his only other sibling was just released
from a psychiatric hospital .
so he &apos;s really desperate to connect to some family right now
and finding this cousin would mean everything to him .
please , help him .
you &apos;re lucky to have a fiance who cares so much .
yeah , she &apos;s really special .
all radley adoptions were closed adoptions
which means i can &apos;t access them in this database .
where are they ?
well , in the archives room .
they haven &apos;t been digitized yet .
i &apos;m not promising anything ,
but i &apos;ll see what i can find by the end of the day .
great . thank you .
i &apos;ve looked everywhere . nothing . you ?
no , i didn &apos;t see any room like hanna described
and nothing that leads him to being a.d.
okay , but there &apos;s got to be something here , right ?
let &apos;s check his bedroom one more time .
go through everything carefully .
what is that ?
it &apos;s the same stamp that maya had on her wrist
in those pictures from years ago .
yeah , that got you into eric kahn &apos;s parties .
charlotte took me to one .
maybe this has pictures on it from those parties .
yeah , or pictures that noel took of hanna when he tortured her .
it &apos;s the dollhouse .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s noel .
i really thought that i hurt someone .
now you know you didn &apos;t .
noel kahn was there the whole time ?
he was helping charlotte ?
we may not be able to prove that he tortured hanna
but this proves that he tortured us
and he &apos;s gonna go to jail for that .
come on , spencer , let &apos;s get out of here .
grab that . come on .
have you looked at any of the other folders ?
no . you @-@ you can , if you want .
no ... i don &apos;t wanna see any of that footage , ever .
yeah , well , the only people who need to see are the police .
well , we can &apos;t give it to them without hanna .
we need to be together for this .
yes , in theory , but we have no idea when she &apos;s gonna be back .
or where she is .
that was lucas . he said he &apos;s not with hanna .
they never had plans to meet in new york .
where the hell is she ?
she wanted to turn noel in last night
and we didn &apos;t listen to her .
okay , but if she was gonna go to the police on her own
she would &apos;ve done it already .
maybe she &apos;s with mona ?
or caleb .
what &apos;s going on ?
spencer and aria are just inside
so just thought it &apos;d be better if we talked out here .
okay ..
well , i &apos;m just on a break at work
and i thought i &apos;d come by and see
if you wanted to go grab a quick bite ?
oh , yeah , i &apos;d love to , but i can &apos;t right now .
why not ?
first , you were weird about that whole
noel kahn guy this morning
and now this .
what &apos;s going on , emily ?
i wish i could tell you .
i &apos;m not trying to pry
i know that you &apos;ve been through a lot in your life
and you &apos;re extremely protective and rightfully so .
but nothing you can say is gonna scare me away .
look , i &apos;m sorry . okay ?
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m just in the middle of something right now .
a @-@ a @-@ and if all goes well tonight
i can explain everything to you tomorrow .
okay ? just ... be patient with me .
please .
okay .
thank you .
cupcakes , red velvet .
i made them for you .
thanks .
hanna is not picking up
and she &apos;s not with mona .
or caleb .
but she did drop by his place last night
to tell him that she would be going off the grid
for a couple of days .
she &apos;s gonna do something to noel .
like what ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , whatever it is , she &apos;s gonna do it alone
because she thought that we wouldn &apos;t help her .
okay , well , we really need to find her
before she does something stupid .
he &apos;s trying to track her down on her phone right now .
and in the meantime ?
in the meantime , we go to the police . we tell them everything .
tell them what ? that hanna said she was gonna be in new york
but we think she &apos;s here , hunting down noel
like it &apos;s &quot; the hunger games ? &quot;
n @-@ no . i @-@ i think we wait and see if caleb can find her .
yeah , i agree .
yeah . okay . sure .
hello ? oh , it is .
okay , i &apos;m sorry . thank you for letting me know .
sorry , guys , that was my neighbor .
my mom &apos;s car alarm is going off &apos; cause of this storm
so i just have to go get the keys and shut it off .
i &apos;m gonna go to jason &apos;s , see if he got
a hold of those adoption records .
and the more we have against noel
when we go to the police , the better .
and let us know if caleb finds her .
yeah .
i &apos;m waiting for somebody .
you &apos;re waiting for me .
i know you killed sara .
i knew you &apos;d eventually slip up .
oh , you got it all wrong .
didn &apos;t you hear ? sara fell in the shower .
then why did you have her phone ?
why drive all the way down to the city to dump it ?
and then come here to try to get it back ?
what do you want , hanna ?
the police are suspecting that there was foul play .
they wanna question me .
sara died in my mom &apos;s hotel .
they know about her past .
and that someone took sara &apos;s room key
from the concierge desk .
well , that doesn &apos;t sound very good ... for you .
or you .
the cellphone was a big screw @-@ up
but we can both walk away from this clean .
after the police talk to me
they &apos;ll question other guests .
i wasn &apos;t in the hotel when it happened .
i went to see a movie .
at my place .
we watched &quot; birdman , &quot; right ?
you help me ... i help you .
i wanna see the phone .
cheers .
you should have some , it &apos;s good .
not my thing .
you have it .
i already have one .
just take a sip .
be careful , hanna ..
or you &apos;ll end up just like sara .
维罗妮卡 · 海斯汀
what did i do ?
what did you make me do ?
hi , marco , it &apos;s spencer . i need your help .
can you please come over as soon as you get this ?
looks like the whole town was out of power .
yeah , we lost ours about 20 minutes ago .
have you heard from the county clerk ?
no . i haven &apos;t , but she said she has to fax over the report
and we need the power for that .
yeah , that &apos;s if she sends it over .
i think she will . thanks to you .
you really turned it on today .
yeah , well , it wasn &apos;t all an act .
my life &apos;s been a little complicated lately
so it &apos;s ... easy to channel my frustration .
look , i know about nicole that she might still be alive .
emily told me ezra went to colombia .
ezra hasn &apos;t called me since this morning .
i @-@ i don &apos;t ... know if they found nicole
but ... i mean , if she is alive ...
what ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what that means for us .
you &apos;re engaged , aria .
he loves you . that &apos;s not gonna change .
yeah , but he loves her too .
if she hadn &apos;t gone missing , they &apos;d probably still be together .
you don &apos;t know that .
and what if i was just his consolation prize ?
no . don &apos;t believe that for a second .
you two were always meant to be .
and this , this was the first time
this community had access to fresh water .
and we were a part of it .
and you could be too .
i got offered a job today .
it &apos;s an editorial assistant position .
are you thinking about taking it ?
i already did .
alan b &amp; lawrence , it &apos;s an amazing company .
it &apos;s a great place for me to get my foot in the door .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t feel like i could say no .
alan b &amp; lawrence .
didn &apos;t they publish ezra &apos;s book ?
yeah , they did .
and they &apos;re working with him on his next one too , right ?
okay , well , that &apos;s just a coincidence .
i , i haven &apos;t spoken to ezra in years .
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll never even cross paths at this job .
you were right about why i took that job .
part of me was hoping
that it &apos;d bring me and ezra back together .
well , if nicole is alive and ezra goes back to her
then it &apos;s his loss .
i can &apos;t imagine there &apos;s anyone better than you .
i should go .
you can &apos;t leave . it &apos;s crazy out there .
no , i &apos;ll be fine .
look , i &apos;m sorry if i made you feel uncomfortable .
please stay .
at least until it calms down .
yeah . yeah , okay .
i &apos;ll make us something to eat .
hanna , we know you &apos;re planning something .
whatever it is , don &apos;t do it .
we found out noel &apos;s been living at his parents &apos; cabin .
and you were right all along . he is dangerous .
hey , we were ready to go to the police
and tell them everything .
but we wanna do this all together .
we love you . please come home .
spencer !
what happened ? are you okay ?
someone &apos;s in the house .
stay there .
u盘不见了
really thought that there was someone in the house .
well , thankfully , that wasn &apos;t the case .
wind must have blown the door open .
can i get you anything ? blanket ? stiff drink ?
i &apos;m so sorry to make you come all the way
down here for nothing .
and then i put you to work .
you didn &apos;t make me do anything .
i &apos;m glad you called .
i should probably get going .
you can ... stay for a little bit longer .
sorry , i just , i really don &apos;t wanna be alone right now .
yeah .
i can do that .
thank you .
hey , can you talk ?
i thought it was gonna be over tonight .
but it didn &apos;t go as we planned .
what happened ?
are you sure you wanna know ?
yes .
noel kahn .
he &apos;s the one doing this to us .
can you come over ?
i &apos;ll be right there .
妮可不是人质之一 我明天回家
i can &apos;t believe this .
the fax from the clerk came through when the power came back on .
and ?
the entire file has been redacted .
what does that mean ?
it means every important piece of information
has been blacked out , father &apos;s name
who adopted the baby .
let me see .
i don &apos;t know why she even bothered faxing this to us .
everything &apos;s blacked out but the name of the judge .
&quot; steven kahn . &quot;
that &apos;s noel kahn &apos;s dad .
so ?
i think he adopted mary &apos;s baby .
it &apos;s over , bitch .
