come on , maura . you can do it .
no , i can &apos;t . i feel like crap .
okay , come on .
i told ma that we &apos;d meet her
at the bunker hill parade , okay ?
she has t.j.
it &apos;s historically incorrect .
the battle of bunker hill was fought on breed &apos;s hill .
okay .
we will tell them that when we get there , okay ?
come on . the doctor cleared you to work out weeks ago .
no , maura .
maura , maura , maura .
come on , come on , come on , come on . come on .
ow , ow , ow !
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
all right . we &apos;ll take it slow . okay .
i still think it &apos;s amazing
they can suck out an organ through a straw .
it &apos;s called a laparoscope ,
and they do not use it to &quot; suck out &quot; your kidney .
&quot; minimally invasive , &quot; my ass .
you &apos;re gonna feel much better
when you get back in shape , okay ?
come on .
are you saying that i &apos;m fat and out of shape ?
no .
i am saying that you have got to stop hoping
that they &apos;re gonna send you
some &quot; thank you for your kidney &quot; fruit basket .
giving the gift of life
is the only reward that i need , okay ?
i &apos;m very happy with my decision .
then why are you still such a whiny pain in the ass ?
did you just call me a whiny pain in the ass ?
no .
maura .
ever since you gave
that ungrateful half @-@ sister of yours your kidney ,
you just -- you just haven &apos;t been yourself .
okay ?
and i &apos;m not the only one that sees it .
just -- - you &apos;ve been talking about me ?
my best friend gossiping after what i &apos;ve been through ?
ooh , it &apos;s cold !
i &apos;m gonna run .
wait . did sergeant korsak say something ?
or was it angela ?
is she complaining ?
you know , after i bought her da hong pao tea .
hey , t.j. , you like the parade ?
you like the music ?
what the heck is that ?
nice , right ? i just bought it .
want to go for a ride ?
no . motorcycles are dangerous .
only if i drop it on my foot .
i can &apos;t get it started .
good .
hey , ma .
hi .
frankie , did you get it ?
did you get it ? !
it &apos;s not official .
angela , if you have an issue with my mood --
your mood ?
well , jane said that you were complaining about me .
i did not say that , ma .
look , sweetheart , we &apos;re worried about you .
wouldn &apos;t you be happier
if you just talked to your mom and sister ?
dr. phil , can this wait , all right ?
frankie has an announcement .
i &apos;m getting promoted to detective .
yes !
in the drug unit .
that &apos;s why i bought this .
it &apos;s my cover .
congratulations , sweetheart .
that &apos;s great .
great job .
well , at least you get to go undercover as a biker
instead of a prostitute .
it wasn &apos;t my idea .
did it cut out suddenly ?
yeah . how &apos;d you know ?
electrical .
unless -- what kind of a sound did it make ?
was it a cough or a wheeze ?
like a
but did it also sputter ?
like a ka @-@ ka @-@ ka @-@ ka @-@ ka @-@ ka @-@ ka ?
no , it was more like kuh @-@ kuh @-@ kuh @-@ kuh @-@ kuh @-@ kuh .
hi ! hello !
can you two please get a room
preferably a soundproof one ?
carburetor .
if you get it over to my house , i &apos;ll help you fix it .
that &apos;d be great . thanks .
well , unless you have a problem with my mood , too .
maura , let it go .
oh , look , there &apos;s senator malcolm humphrey .
well , ex @-@ senator . i worked on his campaign .
oh , look , and right behind
is his beautiful daughter , erica .
such a great story .
she won his seat .
it must be nice
to follow in your father &apos;s footsteps .
what ? no .
i &apos;d be a plumber , and you &apos;d be a mob boss .
well , okay , all i &apos;m trying to say is ,
it would be lovely to have
a father / daughter relationship that works .
i &apos;m sorry , sweetheart .
it &apos;s not your fault pop &apos;s a jerk .
gun !
ma , get t.j. out of here .
oh , my god ! senator !
get e.m.s. here ! get all these people out of here now !
frankie ! this way .
give me the gun .
no . move .
clear .
clear .
a decent deer hunter could have made that shot .
it &apos;s no more than 70 yards .
should we try to find him ?
we don &apos;t know who we &apos;re looking for .
but i don &apos;t think we &apos;re looking for a professional .
what makes you say that ?
he puked after he shot her .
i wonder what that blue stuff is .
get csru in here and have them collect it .
get dna from vomit ?
not usually .
process it anyway .
erica .
dad !
let me through ! let me through !
jennifer ! that &apos;s my sister !
let her through !
oh , dad !
i heard screaming !
oh , my god !
do you want someone to take your baby ?
it &apos;s erica &apos;s baby .
it &apos;s okay , liam . it &apos;s okay , baby .
jennifer , she &apos;s gone .
erica &apos;s gone .
oh , my god !
get the bullet out yet ?
what are you doing ?
biting on a pencil .
yes , i can see that . but why ?
it activates the muscles used for smiling .
well , those muscles are a little out of shape .
i &apos;m going to ignore you and attempt to improve my mood .
okay .
so ... biting pencils works ?
well , holding your teeth in this position
engages the zygomaticus major and the risorius muscle .
i can &apos;t understand you .
some studies show that you can trick your brain
into thinking you &apos;re happy by moving certain muscles .
it &apos;s petty . small @-@ minded .
should be enough to know that i saved someone &apos;s life .
maura , if mother teresa gave her kidney
to a half @-@ sister she barely knew ,
even she would expect a call from her mother saying ,
i don &apos;t know , &quot; thanks for the organ . &quot;
i told hope not to contact me ,
and i never want cailin to know i &apos;m her donor .
great way to spend a sunday .
all right , i &apos;ll talk to you later .
news crews outside ?
it &apos;s a gang bang out there .
sawing @-@ type wound with jagged edges .
two punctures .
it was approximately 2.9 centimeters .
maura , i &apos;m pretty confident
she didn &apos;t die from tetanus .
no , she did not , and you know how i know that ?
because you were there when she was shot ?
&apos;cause this wound looks about five days old .
you think that &apos;s from barbed wire ?
looks like that to me .
okay , maura , um ... i don &apos;t want to rush you
or tell you how to do your job ,
but maybe you could dig out the bullet first
so we could get started on ballistics ?
i think there might be something trapped in the wound .
well , there &apos;s definitely a bullet trapped in the skull .
it &apos;d be good to look at that bullet .
it sure would .
excuse me a minute .
oh , boy .
you think the old maura &apos;s ever coming back ?
man , i hope so .
husband wasn &apos;t at the parade .
what do we know about him ?
he &apos;s a former environmental lawyer , like erica was .
they were married for 10 years .
two kids .
a six @-@ year @-@ old and the toddler
we saw with the sister at the parade .
the sister was her chief of staff .
maybe a radical political organization ,
an opponent , a whack job .
it seems to me there &apos;s a lot easier ways
to kill a state senator .
no , i was thinking the same thing .
small staff , no bodyguards .
what did she make , like 60k a year ?
$ 61,132.99 .
okay , i came upstairs to tell you
that the bullet fragmented when it hit the skull .
how big are the pieces ?
basically shavings .
damn . we &apos;ll have a hell of a time tracing that .
susie &apos;s running the body through x @-@ ray
to make sure i didn &apos;t miss any pieces .
that &apos;s not cool .
okay , that &apos;s mean .
society is slow to change , even though 53 % of women
are the main breadwinners in their households .
how come i don &apos;t have one of those chicks in my household ?
jane , um ...
can i talk to you ?
yeah , sure . i &apos;ll call you later .
or ... uh ...
maura , have you seen the new break room ?
it &apos;s the old break room .
they just took all the old stuff --
thanks for taking the bullet out .
you have your own refrigerator . impressive .
okay , what did you want to talk to me about ?
could you ever be married to a caretaker ?
and this is a pressing question because ...
oh , i was just thinking about you and casey .
well , stop .
i haven &apos;t heard from that guy in three months .
plus , i don &apos;t really think he &apos;s the househusband type .
probably just fell in love with his nurse
or physical therapist .
very common .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
misery loves company .
maura .
i hate seeing you so sad ,
and whatever you &apos;re feeling ,
it &apos;s okay to feel it , all right ?
just say it .
okay .
i did want a fruit basket .
yes .
i did , and it should have had d &apos;anjou pears
and -- and -- and a nice prosecco
and gourmet chocolates and spa stuff .
so pick up the phone and tell her .
i can &apos;t .
maura , okay , look .
it is okay for you to want a relationship with your mom .
you &apos;d be even weirder than you are
if you didn &apos;t want to know your biological mother .
okay , so , now i am a whiny , weird pain in the ass .
i &apos;m trying to be patient .
that must be very hard for you .
it is !
well , i &apos;d at least like to know
if cailin is taking care of my kidney .
well , so , what ? you want to spy on your kidney ?
there you are .
this is nice .
what is it , susie ?
i thought you &apos;d like to know that i was analyzing
the stomach contents from the victim ,
and i noticed blueberries in it .
blueberries ?
i found blue chunks in vomit at the scene .
yeah , i know that .
i was analyzing that , too .
did you compare both the samples ?
yes .
so , erica and her killer
both had the same batch of blueberry waffles
two hours before erica was shot .
wow , that is a huge break
if we can figure out who she ate breakfast with .
i say it &apos;s the husband .
he &apos;s got motive .
which is ?
he &apos;s fed up with being a househusband .
he was a big lawyer when they met .
she worked for him .
well , we could rule out her staffers ,
and her opponent &apos;s right there .
thank you so much .
i love massachusetts , and i love your big hearts .
and we &apos;re live
as slain senator erica humphrey @-@ miller &apos;s husband , jeff miller ,
enters the state house just hours after the shooting .
first thing he does is go to his wife &apos;s office ?
he killed her to take her seat ?
let &apos;s go talk to him .
take frost .
i want to go look at the bullet fragments .
governor just called .
and you know how much i hate it when the governor calls .
not only was our victim a state senator ,
her father has friends in high places ,
so let &apos;s get this shooter as fast as we can .
yes , sir .
i &apos;ll meet you downstairs .
okay .
i heard your mother was at the parade with t.j.
how &apos;s she doing ?
why don &apos;t you call her ?
i mean , i &apos;m sure she &apos;d love to hear from you .
well , i don &apos;t want to bother her .
she just watched a woman get gunned down .
she &apos;s already pretty bothered .
well , tell her -- give her my best .
no matter what , my wife &apos;s work will continue .
she was committed to all of you
and to the people of massachusetts .
yeah , sounds like he &apos;s running for office .
mm @-@ hmm .
you were there .
yes .
i &apos;m detective jane rizzoli .
this is detective bbarry frost .
we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
thank you .
i &apos;ll do whatever i can
to find the people who murdered my wife .
did she have any enemies ?
anyone she was afraid of ?
erica was pushing to pass new environmental legislation .
the bad guys didn &apos;t like that .
you think that got her killed ?
yes .
i think it was a fringe group .
she &apos;d always gotten nasty letters , but ...
this felt organized .
did you call the police ?
she didn &apos;t want to .
did she have a breakfast meeting scheduled for this morning ?
no .
you sure ? she left the house at 7 : 00 .
well , she didn &apos;t get to the parade until 8 : 30 .
where was she for 90 minutes ?
no idea .
i handled her schedule .
all she had today was the parade .
what does &quot; tht &quot; stand for ?
it &apos;s right here on tuesday , june 11th .
i don &apos;t know .
her calendar was packed last week .
it &apos;s wide open this coming week .
&quot; deliver gbs tomorrow . &quot; what does that mean ?
i don &apos;t know .
erica put it in the calendar .
why weren &apos;t you at the parade ?
one of us had to take our six @-@ year @-@ old
to his soccer game .
our children were very important to us .
we didn &apos;t want them to have the childhood erica had .
we were campaign kids .
we spent every spare minute with my dad .
we got to do sports , though .
she was a great skier .
um ... i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;re gonna need to collect her computer .
it &apos;s in her office .
uh , excuse me , mr. miller .
uh , where was your son &apos;s soccer game ?
breed &apos;s park .
that &apos;s not far from the parade .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i didn &apos;t shoot my wife .
we found some evidence at the scene .
well , check with the other parents .
they &apos;ll confirm my alibi .
i intend to ,
and i &apos;m sorry to ask , but i &apos;d like to do a cheek swab .
i &apos;m also an attorney , detective .
you need to show some probable cause ,
and since you don &apos;t have any ,
i &apos;m going home to my motherless children .
i really hope he didn &apos;t kill her .
what &apos;d you find ?
i got her computer .
uh , what do you make of this ?
i found four of these under the senator &apos;s desk .
dirty water ?
her sister doesn &apos;t know why she was keeping them .
i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;ll take it to the lab and have them analyzed .
it &apos;s maura , and she &apos;s out front .
i have no idea why .
i got this . i &apos;ll meet you back at the ranch .
okay , thanks .
do you see her ?
no .
her facebook page said she &apos;d be here .
is that her ?
is that a triple shot with three pumps of caramel ?
well , it &apos;s better than three shots of tequila .
that is not a very respectful way
to treat someone else &apos;s kidney .
oh , god ! get down !
hurry ! hurry ! hurry ! slouch !
oh , did she see us ? did she see us ?
i don &apos;t know , maura . the window &apos;s over there .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m reading an e @-@ mail from susie .
really ?
wait . i can listen to it .
her facebook page
says cailin has checked in at the college cafe .
well , thanks for the tip .
this is awkward .
well , you are spying on her .
i am spying on my kidney .
that is very different .
okay .
go talk to her .
no .
go !
and please hurry .
we have a lot of work to do .
i feel very silly .
you &apos;re gonna feel even sillier
when i push you out with my feet .
cailin ?
cailin , wait . let me -- let me explain .
no . you don &apos;t have to .
i &apos;ve owed you an apology for a long time .
i &apos;m really sorry about everything that i said
and all the crap that i pulled .
i really appreciate you saying that .
i can &apos;t ever really thank you enough .
for what ?
come on , maura .
i &apos;m premed .
i knew it was your kidney ,
but you confirmed it when you got out of the car .
does it still hurt ?
not too bad .
thank you for checking up on me .
that is what you were doing , right ?
i was gonna send this .
it belongs to you .
to me ?
you &apos;ll understand once you open it .
i wrote you a letter , too .
i should probably get to class ,
but would it be all right if i maybe ... were to text you sometime ?
text me . um ...
yes .
yes , i &apos;d like that .
okay . cool .
all right . um ... bye .
bye .
so ...
she gave me this .
wow . scrimshaw .
it &apos;s really pretty .
i think that &apos;s real whalebone .
it &apos;s a family heirloom .
hope gave it to cailin on her 18th birthday .
well , that was sweet of her to give it to you .
or not .
it was a gift to hope on her 18th birthday .
who gave it to her ?
a man who &apos;s about to go on trial for 15 murders .
my father , paddy doyle .
okay , so , this website , &quot; stop bad people , &quot;
looks like the same organization that sent this to erica &apos;s office .
yeah , i &apos;m trying to get a physical address
tied to their i.p. address ,
but whoever built this website is good .
i checked erica &apos;s credit cards .
she didn &apos;t use them today .
the only calls she made were to her husband and her sister .
what about the bullet fragments ?
no , it &apos;s a dead end .
no way we &apos;ll get enough ballistics to even run it .
but based on weight , it &apos;s a .22 .
well , that &apos;s something .
yeah !
i am the man .
&quot; stop bad people &quot; has a boston address .
437 claremont street .
check this out .
they &apos;re anti @-@ women , anti @-@ environment , anti @-@ aaa ?
who &apos;s anti @-@ aaa ?
oh , well , look at this .
whoever administers that hate site is a registered gun owner .
hey , king of the world , if you &apos;re not too busy .
any dna yet ?
no . i &apos;m sorry , detective .
damn . have you seen dr . isles ?
a gravity inverter .
and we &apos;re inverting because ...
i &apos;d rather not say .
okay .
but if you think it &apos;s because of that necklace --
what , this ?
why would a necklace that your mob @-@ boss father
gave your pregnant teenage mom upset you so much
that you &apos;re hanging upside down like a bat ?
well , inverting equalizes cerebral fluid
and eases the strain on the vertebrae .
you &apos;re worried about paddy &apos;s trial , aren &apos;t you ?
i was so wrapped up in recovering from surgery
that i didn &apos;t have time to think about him , too .
it &apos;s very overwhelming .
what do i do ?
i think you know what you should do .
reach out to hope .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s dying to talk to you .
no .
i &apos;m fine .
not with this in your mouth .
come on . come on .
we have a murder to solve .
and i need your help .
take him on down to the interrogation room , tony .
w-- is that the &quot; stop bad people &quot; guy ?
come on .
you &apos;ll get a kick out of this guy .
you &apos;re a detective ?
yeah .
hey , ismail , stop drooling over detective rizzoli
and talk to me about this gun .
you pulled the guts out .
yeah , the -- the plastic ones that come with the game suck .
he used this for video games ?
uh @-@ huh . yeah .
a @-@ are you a fan ?
do you -- do you like -- do you play video games ?
oh , yeah .
how about if you tell us a little bit about your operation ?
um , i @-@ i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re --
what -- what you &apos;re ... talk-- talk-- talking about .
cyber bullying is a federal crime , ismail .
a federal crime .
okay , the service i provide isn &apos;t bullying .
it &apos;s legal harassment .
okay .
you want to tell us why you were legally harassing
senator erica humphrey @-@ miller ?
what ?
oh , that -- that -- you don &apos;t --
i didn &apos;t have any personal animosity towards her
or any of the people my customers hire me to harass .
so that &apos;s your business ?
you build hate websites and send hate mail ?
well , i -- i wouldn &apos;t describe it quite like that .
who hired you to harass the senator ?
i don &apos;t know .
i swear . i don &apos;t .
it &apos;s part of my business model .
i use a pay service that assures anonymity for all my clients .
we &apos;ve seized all his computers .
okay . let &apos;s go see if you are telling the truth .
why -- why would i lie ?
i &apos;m a businessman , not an assassin .
it was -- it was --
it was really nice to meet you , detective .
we should do something sometime or --
hey , should i -- should i wait here ?
yes , why don &apos;t you ?
he &apos;s telling the truth about the pay service .
it &apos;s a pretty complex money transaction .
i &apos;m not sure i can track where the funds come from .
i &apos;ll tell them to let him go .
hey , release that kid , ismail . thanks .
so , all we know is someone orchestrated a nasty campaign
against the victim .
i &apos;m telling you , the husband had time .
soccer parents only remember seeing him
at the beginning and the end of the game .
that &apos;s not enough to arrest him .
we need something that shows they had breakfast together .
yeah , the blueberry waffles are the key here .
if she really left her house at 7 : 00,
she had 90 minutes
before she was first seen at the parade .
so , where &apos;d she go ?
well , she couldn &apos;t have driven
more than , say , 20 miles each way .
so ...
we look ...
20 miles in every direction .
that &apos;s a lot of area to cover .
1,256.6 square miles .
area ...
equals pi &quot; r &quot; squared .
get frankie in here .
have him check every fast @-@ food place
and restaurant that serves breakfast .
i thought he got promoted .
not yet .
glad you &apos;re not my sister .
do you want to do it ?
no .
dna ?
no . results on the water
from the bottles you found under the victim &apos;s desk .
it &apos;s well water mixed with soil .
that &apos;s it ? there &apos;s no contaminates ?
nope .
erica &apos;s hard drive had the results
of groundwater and soil studies
she &apos;d had commissioned over the last six months .
why in readville ?
i don &apos;t know . but everything was normal .
didn &apos;t seem worth mentioning .
is there any way to see if
the water in those bottles came from readville , too ?
i &apos;ll have the crime lab look into it .
what &apos;ll that tell us ?
i don &apos;t know . just following a hunch .
what ? you &apos;re not tired ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m just sick of you yawning .
i &apos;ve got to call it a night .
my dog walker called in sick .
and what &apos;s your excuse ?
slave driver didn &apos;t show up to race the dog team ?
cats having a fashion show ?
hamsters made you dinner ?
yeah . all of the above .
good night .
hey , jane , let &apos;s run .
it &apos;s not too far to your apartment .
now you want to run ?
come on . i finally feel like it .
the things i do for you .
who is that ?
i don &apos;t know .
what are you doing ?
i don &apos;t know what i did with my pepper spray .
i knew i should have brought my gun .
oh , my god . it &apos;s casey .
looks realy good . i hope all of his parts are working .
oh , maura .
hey , there .
hi .
i called the station .
they , uh , they said you were on your way home .
what are you doing here ?
you look great .
well , i feel pretty good .
wow , i mean , you &apos;ve recovered most of your mobility .
are you wearing thermoplastic braces ?
you &apos;ve got good eyes .
yeah .
i mean , how is that possible ?
you had cauda equina .
it isn &apos;t treatable .
well , i &apos;m still trying to believe it myself .
i got lucky .
i was , uh , i was misdiagnosed thanks to a bad mri ..
but you still had neurosurgery .
oh , yeah .
they opened me up ,
and they found shrapnel pressing against my spinal cord .
took it out .
that &apos;s incredible .
it really is .
and what about sexual function ?
dr. isles , this is actually not one of your patients .
sorry .
sorry .
i &apos;m gonna go finish my run . i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
no , maura , come on . i &apos;ll take you home . it &apos;s ...
so happy this isn &apos;t awkward .
i have to walk jo friday .
i mean , do you want to --
yeah . i &apos;d really like that .
okay .
i never know how long
you &apos;re supposed to let a dog sniff .
you &apos;re not . she &apos;s marking territory .
look sharp !
cesar , the dog whisperer .
he uses that expression .
it &apos;s from the north of england .
it means be quick and do your business .
she only did that because you &apos;re a soldier
and you have a hint of an accent .
i don &apos;t have an accent .
yes , you do .
it was worse when we were in high school ,
but i can still hear
the north of england in you .
that &apos;s something i love about you --
that you &apos;ve known me for so long .
my massive crush began on you when i was 15 .
i wrote about 100 e @-@ mails to you in the hospital ,
more when i was recovering .
i never got them .
i didn &apos;t send any of them .
it wasn &apos;t just the physical injuries that stopped me .
it was , uh ...
it was ptsd .
i know a little about post @-@ traumatic stress disorder .
someday , if -- if you want to hear it ,
i &apos;ll tell you what happened .
right now , i &apos;m just so happy to see you .
i see the neurosurgeon fixed that , too .
he did .
god , you &apos;re beautiful .
you &apos;re beautiful .
i &apos;m thinking something , jane .
what ? no , no , no . no thinking . no thinking .
yeah .
i &apos;m thinking that ...
i want us to be in love before we do this .
i can &apos;t just show up --
ugh . god , you &apos;re good .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
well , you just said the best line
to get a woman to take her clothes off .
i did ?
yes .
you know you did .
casey ?
you don &apos;t leave a chef an awful lot to work with .
jar of pickles and marmite that expired five years ago .
put that back .
maura gave that to me .
i might use it to kill her someday .
good morning .
morning .
somebody needs to take care of you .
i should have told you this last night .
no , if this is about your stds or your ex @-@ wives or --
just please save it for after breakfast .
i &apos;m going back to afghanistan .
just for a few months .
i &apos;ve been asked to go with a team of psychologists .
i &apos;m getting training in virtual therapy for combat soldiers .
is that what helped you ? virtual therapy ?
then i understand .
i knew you would .
when i get back ,
i think it &apos;s time you and i give it a shot .
me too .
go all domestic together .
yes , but there has to be rules
before you throw out my marmite .
i &apos;ll get you another jar ,
and i &apos;ll also teach you to get jo friday to look sharp .
maybe .
only if you keep the accent .
i ... don &apos;t have an accent .
yes , you do .
you do have an accent .
hello ?
help .
you &apos;re supposed to set it for your height .
i was thinking about the case .
i think you were thinking about the case @-@ y .
well , i came to see you ,
but someone was taking their sweet time
in coming to work .
well , that &apos;s &apos; cause you wouldn &apos;t stop talking
when i was trying to get dressed .
you called me .
he &apos;ll be back , jane .
you said he &apos;d be at the bagram air base .
yeah , but he still has to go to kandahar .
by plane .
he said no road travel .
you know , when he told me , i was so sad and terrified .
but i was also ...
oh , my god . it can &apos;t be .
what ? tell me .
i was relieved .
is that all ?
what do you mean , is that all ?
you &apos;ve been pining over this man for a year now .
it &apos;s simply fear talking .
you &apos;re afraid that if you allow yourself to get involved ,
you &apos;ll get hurt ,
so you &apos;re looking for reasons to withdraw .
i am not .
he moved the cereal boxes .
and he threw out my shredded wheat .
you &apos;ve had that box for five years .
i just opened it .
i mean , what if this is the gateway
to mom jeans and baby slime
and -- and arguments over the remote control
and clipping coupons and buying in bulk ?
okay , go back to telling me about the part
when he had you pinned against the building .
oh , yeah .
some of the results are in
on the particulate found in erica &apos;s scratch .
disturbed soil .
disturbed soil ?
that just means it &apos;s from an old industrial area .
looks like readville .
readville .
again .
and again .
the second round of water results are back , too ,
and the water in the bottles from erica &apos;s office
was also from readville .
hey . what do you got ?
i cannot wait until 5 : 00 on friday ,
when my promotion becomes official
and i don &apos;t have to be your personal patrol @-@ officer slave .
just tell me if you found a diner
that serves blueberry waffles in readville , please .
why didn &apos;t you tell me it was in readville ?
do you know how many places i called ?
394 , jane .
i didn &apos;t know we were looking in readville , frankie .
that &apos;s what you do when you &apos;re a detective .
you detect .
all right .
thank you .
hey , maura .
morning , frankie .
jane , the yellow pollen in her scratch
is from the lonicera hirsuta ,
also called the hairy honeysuckle flower .
does the horny honeysuckle grow in readville ?
hairy .
no . it only grows in the berkshires .
then you can tell me about the hairy horny flower later .
let &apos;s go get blueberry waffles .
oh , i already ate .
no -- i did , too , but you &apos;re coming with me .
no , i &apos;m not .
yes , you are .
i might need you to take some water samples , okay ?
come on . the key to this is readville .
good morning .
hi . do you have blueberry waffles ?
oh , we just ran out .
but the corned beef hash is really good .
maura .
that &apos;s our victim .
what are we gonna do now ?
senator erica was the only one who &apos;d listen .
see that little boy ?
he &apos;s so sick now he can barely hold up his head .
cancer .
and that little girl and that one , too .
something is poisoning us all here .
i &apos;m sorry .
let me get you two a table .
thank you .
okay , that &apos;s why erica was doing soil and water testing
here in readville .
nonspecific symptoms and unrelated illnesses
don &apos;t necessarily mean
that environmental toxins are getting in the water supply .
you know , don &apos;t ever eat in hospital cafeterias .
oh , and avoid anybody in scrubs .
anything else ?
why do you have to be like that ?
like what ?
like every time you have a random thought ,
i got to get into your random @-@ thought caravan .
well , hospital uniforms are teeming with bacteria .
i &apos;m giving you a tip to be healthy .
maura , that &apos;s it .
what &apos;s it ?
oh , now i &apos;m supposed to get in your caravan .
they &apos;re factory workers .
look at the logos -- that horny flower .
hairy .
what makes it distinctive is the fuzzy leaves .
wait . let me see your tablet .
hairy honeysuckle battery company .
you said this only grows in the berkshires .
it does . it &apos;s endangered .
looks like they transplanted it .
the vines are growing on the barbed wire .
you found that same pollen in soil in erica &apos;s scratch .
she must have snuck in the factory .
what was she looking for ?
well , they recycle lead @-@ acid , nickel cadmium ,
nickel metal hydride batteries .
how toxic is all that ?
newer batteries are reasonably clean ,
but older batteries , they release lead and cadmium .
could the workers carry that out on their uniforms ?
yes , it &apos;s known as take @-@ home toxins .
tht &apos;s -- take @-@ home toxins .
erica had written that down in her calendar .
these men are probably covered in toxins .
and erica figured that out , and whoever killed her
didn &apos;t want her making that public .
bill davenport owns the factory .
problem is , he was in san francisco yesterday .
so , unless he hired someone , he &apos;s not our shooter .
look at this , jane .
erica humphrey @-@ miller wrote up a grant proposal .
to the department of energy ? why ?
it looks like the grant money was supposed to fund
environmentally friendly practices .
hairy honeysuckle got 2 million bucks .
why am i paying taxes ?
so they can give them to bill davenport ?
does he look like he needs the money ?
well , it &apos;s used to pay for safeguards
like showers and air regulators ,
in addition to disposable uniforms .
which they weren &apos;t using .
what if they took the government handout
and then paid off an inspector to look the other way ?
osha doesn &apos;t monitor take @-@ home toxins
with inspectors yet .
they rely on outside regulators .
frost , scroll to the end of that document .
look who was in charge of compliance .
you said you didn &apos;t know what tht meant .
then i &apos;ll decode that for you .
it means &quot; take @-@ home toxins . &quot;
where are we going with this ?
you said you had a development in the case .
we do .
these are straps for a .22 caliber rifle ,
aren &apos;t they , jennifer ?
erica and jennifer were both biathletes .
what does this have to do with my daughter &apos;s murder ?
senator , you need to hear this .
your resume on the senate website
says you went to law school .
doesn &apos;t say you failed the bar three times .
no husband , no children .
erica threw you a bone making you chief of staff .
detective frost , please tell us what you found .
the person who paid &quot; stop bad people &quot;
to harass erica used a pay service
that hides their customers &apos; identities
by sending the money through a boston bank ,
a nashville bank , and , finally , a bank in london .
those documents there trace a transaction
right back to your office computer .
what ?
what the hell is going on here ?
i think jennifer knows .
that &apos;s pretty cold , jennifer .
we found gun oil inside the baby &apos;s backpack ...
and what &apos;s left of a blueberry waffle .
three months ago , erica started testing
the water and the soil in readville
because the children were so sick ,
but the water was fine , the soil was fine ,
so it didn &apos;t make any sense ...
unless the toxins were coming
from the only new thing in town --
the honeysuckle battery factory .
oh , no , no , no , no . that &apos;s not possible .
erica got them a $ 2 million grant to prevent that .
i bet it was hard for erica to believe
that her little sister would take a bribe
and let children die .
&quot; deliver gbs . &quot;
tell your father , jennifer .
what did that mean ?
it meant ...
deliver goodbye speech .
oh , my god .
erica was gonna resign and expose you ,
and i &apos;ll bet she was even gonna take the responsibility
and clean up the environmental mess that you made .
i want a lawyer .
i bet you do .
i &apos;m sorry , senator .
at least her children won &apos;t be orphans .
even more reason to marry a househusband .
i &apos;m glad i don &apos;t have a sister .
well , cailin &apos;s not gonna shoot me .
you know , that motorcycle would make a beautiful cafe racer .
come on .
he &apos;s in the drug unit , not the espresso unit .
the harley look is passe .
1960s british rockers are back .
actually , cafe racer could be a better cover
for busting dealers selling in clubs and colleges .
i &apos;m in .
can you get it running ?
well , the intake vacuum pressure pulls the fuel through
and mixes liquid with air
before it sucks it into the combustion chamber .
mm . go on .
violent explosion rams the big piston down
with great force .
long connecting rod forces the crank pin into rotation ,
which is what you want .
god , i would love to have my crank pin rotated
right about now .
i knew you &apos;d miss him .
okay , you guys are making me really uncomfortable .
oh , stop it , you big lug .
you would not have done --
i didn &apos;t know you were here .
hello .
hi , lieutenant .
we were just gonna make dinner together .
i hope you two don &apos;t mind .
no .
no . how nice .
night .
&quot; night &quot; ?
what the hell ?
shh ! they can hear you !
i hope they can hear me !
they shouldn &apos;t be doing
whatever it is they &apos;re planning to do .
frankie , go in there .
me ? i &apos;m not going in there . you go in there .
no .
i hope you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;m gonna toss your mother around a bit , all right ?
shh !
yeah , you know what ? i mind !
we are minding !
toss ? them ? i can &apos;t . no .
