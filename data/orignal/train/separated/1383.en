Well, this is it.
If Grandma were here, she'd be proud we were doing this.
If she were here, she'd tell me I look fat in this dress.
And that my beard is a health hazard.
She smelled like compost.
I liked her. She had candies.
All right. Let's get it over with.
We bury her with her rock collection?
I-I'm gonna drop her, guys.
Some help here!
I swear this wasn't me.
Do you know what this announcement is all about?
It's Jane's news.
Just tell me. I'll act all surprised.
Did I mention that I'm doing rounds at the clinic now?
I'm gonna see three patients today.
Okay. Good for you.
What's the news?
I don't want to spoil it.
Spoil what?
Your announcement.
You didn't tell her, did you?
I would never!
All right, what's going on? I need to know.
I'm gonna be an instructor at the FBI.
The FBI!
The FBI?
Yeah.
In Washington, D.C.?
Yes.
I'm leaving the force.
I thought that you would be thrilled.
I mean, I just never considered that you being safe
would...mean moving 500 miles away.
343...nautical miles.
It's 7 hours and 7 minutes via route 15.
Well, that's still really far for a cup of coffee.
When is this happening?
There's still a lot of details to work out --
my -- my background check, things like that.
I haven't told BPD.
I just, you know, wanted you to know.
My daughter, the FBI agent.
I-Instructor.
I'm proud of you, Janie.
Yeah?
Yes.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I've never been to Washington, D.C.
It's just like any other big city.
Where you can sit in on a session of Congress.
Or see the world's largest collection of the Bard's works.
What's Bard?
Who cares?
Okay, don't say "The Bard."
No-- Nobody says "The Bard."
All right. Well, the Smithsonian has an exhibit
on modern medicine in the Great War.
Pass.
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.
Angela, tell her.
Yeah, well, it wouldn't kill you to have some culture, Janie.
But Janie don't like buildings where she can't touch the walls.
Honey, you're the FBI.
You can touch anything you want.
Okay.
Come on!
Phyllis Henderson, 88 -- natural causes.
Today is her fu--
was her funeral.
Party crasher.
Who is he?
We're running prints.
He obviously didn't have his wallet on him.
Yeah, can you get a tarp and cover them up?
The family's right there.
The family's okay with it.
I asked the oldest grandson if he recognized our victim.
He said, "Maybe Grandma used him for food."
And in this scenario, was Granny a cannibal or a vampire?
Either way, they're good.
You know, the ancient Egyptians believed
that burying them together would ensure
that they're together in the afterlife.
Well, maybe Granny will knit him a cozy.
Yeah, a loincloth for the afterlife.
It looks like he's been dead for about 12 hours.
This is a very odd wound.
It appears that he got run through with
some sort of cylindrical object.
And he's very clean.
Yes, but a wound like this would have bled profusely.
The family said that the funeral was
at Mason Funeral Home in Mission Hill.
They had the casket until the hearse picked it up
and brought it here this morning.
I hate funeral homes.
Sorry, Mrs. Henderson.
I'm sure someday,
all of you will look back on this and laugh.
Some sooner than others.
Hi, Grandma!
T.J.!
Oh, what a wonderful surprise!
Where's your daddy?
Hey, Ma. I was feeding the meter.
Hey, don't "Hey, Ma" Me.
Why didn't you call?
I had no idea you were coming.
We wanted to surprise you.
T.J.'s been asking about you.
And I needed to see some Rizzoli faces
besides the one in the mirror.
Oh, are you a bad liar.
How do you know?
You got spies in Chicago?
Hey, Teri. This is T.J.
And you know, Teri's got some ice cream in the back.
Want some?
Yes.
Yes.
Go ahead.
So...
Lydia met somebody else.
Yeah, I just... felt like it would be best to make a clean break.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure this is a difficult time for you.
Yeah, it has been, but we'll get through it.
Just need to figure out what we're doing next.
All right. I'll tell you what you're gonna do.
T.J.'s having some ice cream.
I'm gonna make you a sandwich.
And then we'll go to Jane's townhouse.
She's got an extra room.
Are you sure?
I mean, it's two of us now.
Tommy, if I told you once, I've told you a hundred times --
There can't be too many Rizzolis!
I missed you.
Missed you, too, Ma.
Okay.
For the record, when it's my time, not this.
Anything but this.
I've always wanted to see a Viking funeral.
What, like burial at sea?
Yeah, but they light you on fire first.
I'm in.
Yeah.
May I help you?
Yes, uh, we need to speak to someone
regarding Phyllis Henderson's funeral, please.
That service was this morning.
Mr. Mason, our owner, handled those arrangements.
Do you know where we could find him?
I haven't seen him.
Korsak.
Excuse me.
Is this Mr. Mason?
Yes.
Is everything all right?
Is there a family member we could talk to?
Uh, yeah. His sister's in the prep room.
Thank you very much.
Something tells me this case is gonna be a weird one.
Ugh. It's freezing in here.
He probably doesn't mind.
Hello?
I'll be right there.
Korsak.
Is that blood?
Could be castoff.
Oh, that would make a nice murder weapon.
Could we be standing in our crime scene?
Hello?
Kate Mason?
Yes.
Can I help you?
My brother's body was in Mrs. Henderson's casket?
Yes.
I'm gonna need to ask you a couple questions.
When was the last time you saw your brother?
Last night, around 8:00.
He was finishing with Mrs. Henderson when I left.
Why are they taking my trocar?
Your what?
Trocar -- it's used to suction fluids out of organs
in the abdominal cavity.
Well, it's possible that your brother
was stabbed with a similar object.
CSRU found this in the incinerator.
That's Sam's apron.
They burned his clothes? Why would someone do that?
Probably so he couldn't be traced
back to your funeral home.
Who else has access to the prep room, besides yourself?
Sam and I are usually the only ones who go in there.
It upsets most people.
Wait -- Are you asking me that because you think
I had something to do with this?
I did not hurt my brother.
We said good night, and I went bowling.
That was the last time I saw him.
We'll need you to confirm that.
Of course.
You should talk to that woman he's been seeing.
What woman?
I saw her pick him up after work a few times.
I figured he had a new girlfriend
he wasn't ready to tell me about.
Would that have been typical of him?
No. He didn't really keep secrets.
And he'd been jumpy about it, you know?
Like something was on his mind.
All right. We'll be in touch.
Are you sure it was him?
Yes. I'm sorry.
Hi. Thank you.
Mr. Gomez, please come in.
The doctor will see you now.
Hello. I'm Dr. Isles.
Uh, they don't really speak English.
We were waiting for Dr. Hope.
I'm sorry. She's out of town.
I'm covering for her.
Dr. Hope has always been there for our family.
Well, I'm her daughter.
I'm not as experienced as her, but I'll do my best to help.
Is this Ana?
Yes.
Doctors at the hospital say that she will die,
that there's nothing that they can do to help her.
Hello.
She's beautiful.
According to her bloodwork, Ana has biliary atresia.
Her liver is failing.
It could be related to her autoimmune system.
We're not fully sure, but it is terminal.
Can you help her?
Well, currently, there is no treatment
for this condition and no cure,
so I'm afraid I have to agree with Ana's other doctors.
The best we can do is make her comfortable.
Until she dies?
Well, her alkaline phosphatase tests...
...look dangerously high.
Do you mind if we pray for you?
Of course not.
But I must emphasize -- the prognosis,
it's -- it's out of my hands.
We agree.
It is in much higher hands than yours.
I can't believe Sam was murdered.
It's awful.
His cellphone records show
that you two communicated a lot lately.
That's true.
Cleaning staff at the funeral home said
they saw you there last night.
I was supposed to meet him,
but he was gone by the time I arrived.
Were you there for a date?
What? No.
I'm a broker. He hired me to sell his business.
The funeral home?
Yes.
He said he wanted to sell as quickly as possible.
I had an offer from a big chain mortuary,
and I was bringing him the papers to sign.
Did he say why he was selling?
He said he was fed up with the business.
I figured they had money problems.
A lot of these places do.
He was in such a hurry to sell.
He told me he'd even sell undervalue if necessary.
What did Kate Mason have to say about that?
Who?
His sister and business partner.
He never mentioned anything to me about a business partner.
He said he wanted out as quickly as possible.
He was trying to sell the family business
from right under her nose without telling her.
And for no apparent reason.
The funeral home was in the black.
So were his personal accounts.
Maybe he was just sick of it.
Well, I get that, but why not tell the sister?
He was trying to rip her off, and she found out?
Here you go.
Yeah, and then she stabbed him
with the organy suctiony thing.
Trocar.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Thanks.
Her alibi checked out. She was bowling.
Till 10:00. I mean, she still could have done it.
Okay, this is, like, 90% foam.
What is yours?
What?
I got an interesting call earlier this week.
Yeah?
From the FBI, vetting their newest hire.
I was gonna tell you about it.
When you handed me your resignation?
N-No. When the -- the time was right.
Which is when?
Which is when I can think about not seeing you every day
and not cry about it --
which is...not now, so...
Okay, this is a $5 cup of crap!
Just so you know...
I think what you're doing is really great.
Really?
I'm happy for you.
And I don't want to make you cry, but...
I'll miss you.
What'd you tell them?
Oh, I gave them a thorough character assessment.
What does that mean?
Do you find anything?
Not much, but I did confirm
that the blood spatter on the ceiling was his.
Well, that's something.
Actual cause of death was transverse thoracic impalement,
likely from the trocar.
How gross is that thing?
Well, I'd say it's rather innovative.
I mean, how else would you propose
draining fluids from a body?
I don't.
Because I'm having a Viking funeral.
Korsak is gonna shoot a flaming arrow
at my dead body on a boat and just -- "Fzzt!"
Rizzoli bonfire.
‭Can't wait.
That's not really how Norse funerals are done.
Party pooper.
Fine. Is that it?
Forensically speaking, yes.
But I do have something else you might be able to use.
The fact that the victim was a funeral director
reminded me of a case that came in from Essex County
about six weeks ago.
The victim was stabbed to death and thrown into a grave.
And it turns out that the grave was dug
for a casket from Mason's Funeral Home.
Stranger still, the body was embalmed.
Wait -- aren't all bodies embalmed?
No, uh, not the deceased person in the casket,
but the murder victim in the dirt.
Huh. That's a twist.
Can you tell if the same person embalmed both bodies?
Well, the technique used for both bodies was the same,
so in my opinion, yes.
Would you say said person was Sam Mason?
I might, if I could see records
of his most recent work for comparison.
Done.
Ooh. How'd it go at the clinic?
A family prayed for me to help their baby.
Is that a bad thing?
It's a very grim case,
so I just don't see what good it could do.
Well, that's between them and whomever they're praying to.
I'm a doctor, so I don't believe --
I know, but...
can't hurt, can it?
I've been dealing with Essex County homicide.
Their murder is still unsolved.
Did they give you any information you can use?
Ben Norton -- he's 22, unemployed,
lived in Roxbury with two roommates.
Did he know our victim?
Not that I can confirm.
But he and Kate Mason attended the same college
in Fairfield, Connecticut.
Doesn't mean they know each other.
They might have.
Okay, so, Kate Mason knows Ben Norton
and kills him for some reason.
She then asks her brother to help her dispose of his body?
Sam Mason embalms the body to buy time and then ditches it
when the next funeral comes their way?
But then what? He just freaks out and wants to sell the business
so he can get away from his sister?
Could be, but she finds out about it and gets rid of him.
But she can embalm people herself.
Why rope her brother into it?
Guess we're gonna have to ask her.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I don't know this person.
You didn't cross paths with Ben Norton at Fairfield College?
Not that I'm aware of.
Yet, you know that his body was buried in a grave
that was dug for one of your clients, correct?
I knew that a body had been found in Essex County,
that there was an investigation.
Okay, but you didn't mention that when we spoke.
My brother just died.
I was thinking about him.
That thing in Essex never even occurred to me.
But you see the coincidence, right?
This victim died of stab wounds.
Your brother was stabbed.
Both bodies were found in graves
for clients of your funeral home.
Yes. I guess.
Who inherits Sam's share of the business now that he's gone?
Our parents are dead. I guess I do.
So I guess it's good that the sale didn't go through, huh?
What sale?
Sam had an offer from Hilldale Holdings
to buy the mortuary.
The woman you saw him with was a broker.
Sam would never sell me out. We were partners.
What do I have to do to convince you I didn't do this?
You can help us solve this thing.
We would like the information on every body
that you and your brother embalmed.
Fine.
Am I gonna need a lawyer or something?
That's up to you.
Do you have something you feel like you'd like to hide?
The funeral home sent over their files.
I, uh, just left them on your desk.
Thank you.
How's the baby?
The clinic called.
Her breathing has become erratic.
Yeah, well, that's to be expected, isn't it?
Yes, unfortunately.
You know, I've read every pediatric journal in print,
and I can't find anything to help her.
I know.
I know empirically that there's nothing I can do,
but...
I just can't stop feeling responsible.
I'm sorry, Maura.
Me too.
Yeah! Aw! Beat me again!
This kid's like a shark!
So, when do I get to meet Ron, the handsome cardiologist?
Oh, whenever you want. He's around.
You really reinvented yourself, huh?
Well, so did you.
Plumbers' union -- That's a big deal.
I'm happy you finished your training.
Chicago's been good to us.
Chicago's too far away.
I needed to get away. I felt smothered here.
By who? By me?
No.
You know, I just had to be on my own, grow up.
Well, you grew up.
I'm proud of you.
Thanks, Ma.
Now it's T.J.'s time to grow up.
Yeah, he's growing up so fast, he's giving me whiplash.
Aren't you?
And he's gonna beat you again.
You know, if you move back, I could help you with T.J.
No smothering.
I don't know, Ma.
I'm just putting it out there.
I mean, it's your decision, and I'll respect it.
You want to stay here with Grandma?
Yes.
Oh, no! You beat her again! Really?! Are you kidding me?!
All right. So, two D's.
Okay. And last name --
What are you doing?
The FBI called me for a background check.
I'll have to call you back.
I was gonna tell you.
It's okay. I understand.
You wanted to wait till everything was final.
But, you know, I realized that after you leave,
I'm not gonna be able to come in here
and hug you whenever I want.
You never come in here and hug me whenever you want.
Until now.
What? Oh, God. No!
What -- Just -- What did Maura say?
Well, she ruled out the sister.
Based on what?
The sister was left-handed.
That means she had a completely different embalming technique.
Sam did the embalming. They're positive.
She was telling the truth.
I cross-referenced the funeral home records
with those from local cemeteries.
There are some gaps.
"Omissions" are probably more accurate.
These are cemetery records
burials of caskets that came from Mason's Funeral Home.
But some of them don't exist in Mason's files.
Somebody's scrubbing the books.
To make it look like these funerals never happened?
Yeah.
I'll get a ground-penetrating radar team out to the cemeteries
whose records don't line up with Mason's.
Hey, is Smitty in today? It's Korsak.
Do not hug me.
Nice day for an exhumation.
This a recent Mason's funeral?
Well, according to the cemetery, yes.
But according to the funeral home...
It never happened.
The burial was nine days ago.
Our radar team got an anomalous reading.
It looks like the corpse has two heads.
I wonder if that's how Frankie put it in the warrant.
How are you doing, by the way?
Well, we have another cemetery to cover after this
and the mausoleums.
I meant about Jane leaving.
I'm struggling, to be honest.
I'm happy for her, of course,
and I'm sure it's the right decision.
But you don't want her to go.
Is that very selfish of me?
If it is, we're in the same boat.
Detective, I'm ready.
At least the poor girl still has her clothes on.
In all, we've found four bodies
in other people's graves or caskets --
Sam Mason, Ben Norton,
now Greta Shaw and Anne Hart.
So he's a serial killer?
Well, if we go down that road,
Ben Norton was probably his first kill.
He was sloppy -- just dumped him in the dirt.
Then the next two were planned more carefully.
He waited for a funeral to come along
so he could put the victims' bodies into the caskets.
Decent theory.
We know he was embalming them.
Why do that?
Well, he worked for the mob or a hit man.
How did he get mixed up in that?
I don't know.
But whether or not he killed these people,
I know he didn't then kill himself
and jump naked into the casket.
True.
So, if we figure out who killed Sam Mason,
we might be able to find who killed the other three.
I heard about Jane's FBI decision.
How are you doing?
Okay.
By which, you mean not okay at all?
Well, Denial's working in my favor right now.
It's hard to imagine her leaving.
Can you picture this place with only one Rizzoli in it?
You're all the Rizzoli I need.
You know, it's been a while since I've been up this close
and personal with an embalmed body.
You can hear yourself when you speak, correct?
I meant when I was at school, Jane.
Spent a lot of time with old Gertrude.
Gertrude?
It's his medical cadaver, not a weird girlfriend.
‭She was a great old gal.
You know, she donated her body to the university
'cause she always wanted to go to medical school.
Think I've got a picture of her somewhere around here.
Okay, hi. Uh, can we talk about these two bodies, please?
Yes.
So, we conducted side-by-side autopsies,
and both bodies had stab wounds on the upper-right abdomen.
But the actual cause of death was dry drowning.
Sounds painful.
It is.
The lungs become unable to extract oxygen from the air --
in this case, a result from a puncture wound.
So, the killer stabbed these two
specifically to puncture their lungs?
Yes, which is why it leads me to believe
that Sam Mason is likely not the killer.
Both women have multiple stab marks on their abdomen,
suggesting that the killer made several attempts
before finally piercing the lung.
So he was guessing about where to stab them.
Or he didn't have the tools
to fatally puncture the lung on the first try.
That doesn't sound like Sam Mason.
Anatomical expertise defines a mortician's work.
Okay, so, if Sam didn't kill these two,
why did he embalm them?
I'm afraid they can't tell us that.
Maybe he was in such a hurry to sell because he knew
that there were more murdered victims headed his way.
That's why he wanted out.
Oh, you guys, I've missed this.
Mmm. We're gonna have to hang out as much as possible
before you ship out.
Okay, I'm not enlisting in the Army.
You excited?
I am.
I am, but, I mean, you know, leaving home is --
It's hard. I get it.
Now that Lydia's gone, I'm, uh...
thinking about coming back here.
Really? That'd be great!
Yeah. Tommy, I-I-I could talk to the professor.
You -- You could take over the place for me here.
I mean, Ma's just down the road.
Well, it'd be nice for something good
to come out of this whole thing.
But I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and Lydia.
Eh, it's for the best.
I mean, I think I'll just stick to the dad thing,
leave the husband stuff to somebody else.
All right. Well, don't, you know, give up totally.
I mean, you guys just weren't right for each other, you know?
Or maybe us Rizzolis aren't cut out for marriage.
Speak for yourself.
I don't know. Ma might agree with him.
Come on, Frankie. Look at us.
Lone wolves. Runs in the family.
It's not a genetic disorder.
You just got to find the right person.
All right. Take Korsak.
He probably never thought he'd get married again.
But look at him now. The guy's never been happier.
You got a point.
Thank you.
You guys are loud!
Oh! Sorry, T.J.
I got it. I got it.
Yes, we are! We are so loud!
Hey, did I ever tell you the story
about the little green man named Yoda?
No.
No?!
Mm-hmm. Okay, come on. Let me tell you.
Oh, you're gonna love this one. It's awesome.
Have you been here all night?
Yeah.
I just haven't been able to sleep.
I've been, um, thinking about the baby.
Were there any changes?
Well, they said her color improved a little bit
after I had the nurse adjust the fluids and electrolytes.
Okay, well, that's something.
Not enough.
You know, in homicide, the stakes are high,
but...not like this.
I just...
I don't know how I'm gonna face her family today.
Well, Maura, you may not have the answer,
but you're the perfect doctor for that baby.
How's that?
Because the work that you're doing
takes compassion and courage,
and that's what that family needs right now.
What am I gonna do when you're not here?
You'll pick up the phone.
As will I.
It's not the same.
No, it's not.
But we'll get through it, like we always do.
Together?
I was gonna say "with wine."
But...yeah.
Together.
Still working on the connection between our victims.
Each of them disappeared in the last few months,
but there were no missing-persons reports filed for any of them.
Transients?
Not homeless, but they did move around a lot.
So disappearing wouldn't be a red flag
for people that knew them.
Did they know each other?
Not that I can tell.
Looks like their cellphone records
have exactly one number in common.
I'm running the reverse trace now.
Please be Sam Mason.
They're models?
If our killer targeted young, attractive people in the area,
a modeling agency would be filled with victims.
And we don't know who he is yet.
So a lot of people are still in danger.
I'll drive.
My models mostly book print work --
catalogs, brochures.
They go to New York or L.A. if they have higher aspirations.
So it's normal for your clients to just disappear,
like these three?
Well, they stop checking in, I assume they moved on.
It happens every day.
Is there any other information that you can give us
about these three -- something they had in common,
a reason why someone might target them?
Well, Ben booked a high-end car campaign.
Greta is my swimsuit girl.
And Anne was a domestic diva --
diapers, cleaning products, that sort of thing.
We're gonna need the information
on all the meetings and auditions you sent them on.
Sure. - Also an employee list --
anyone they might have crossed paths with here.
I hate to think of my people in danger.
Hello, everyone.
How is she?
Uh, they said that you ordered more tests?
Yes -- hemoglobin and bilirubin.
We need to monitor how her condition is advancing.
Sarah?
Yes, Dr. Isles?
When were these samples drawn?
Last night.
Do another blood draw.
I also need a cortisol analysis and another liter of fluid.
And please call Dr. Harris at the hospital.
Tell him I'm bringing a patient in immediately.
Okay.
W-What is it?
Well, it's too -- too soon to say,
but seems to be some marked improvement in some crucial factors.
It's happening.
I'm sorry?
You brought us our miracle.
Well, they're all gorgeous. That's for sure.
Think that's what got them killed?
I don't know. The agency records -- that was a dead end?
These three never intersected on auditions
or booked the same job.
I was hoping for a shampoo commercial
or a newspaper ad -- something.
Like that.
Look -- one, two, three.
Are they all standing in the same place?
Yeah.
That's the farmers market on Beacon Street.
Well, so that must mean that they used the same photographer.
If that's true, they would have paid him for these shots.
Okay, let's go through their bank accounts.
He's got to be in there somewhere.
I'm uncomfortable with this. Eddie's a very private man.
He's also a number-one suspect in a murder investigation.
Maybe we could just wait for him to return?
We'd prefer to do it our way.
Trophies.
Yep.
This guy's whole M.O. is a slow death.
Plenty of time to take pictures.
Jesus.
His calendar says he's got a shoot booked right now.
Farmers market's a couple blocks from here.
Perfect. Now turn away from me and look back.
It's just, I have this mole.
Very easy to touch that up.
Really?
Let's, uh, take these back to the studio.
I'll show you how I do it.
Okay.
Police!
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Move, move, move, move!
You got him?
Yeah.
Get up.
Get up!
You know you're gonna miss this part, right?
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
‭We've known Eddie for years.
His parents were killed in a car accident when he was 16.
Sam looked out for him after that.
Sounds like your brother had a big heart.
In his confession,
did Eddie say why Sam embalmed those victims,
why he didn't go to the police?
Because of you.
Me?
Eddie had told Sam that if he stopped helping him
or if he went to the authorities,
then he would come after you.
He was trying to protect me.
Yeah. Your brother loved you very much.
I guess that's the most important thing
to hang on to right now.
Thank you, Detective.
Sure.
Hey. You got my text.
Yeah.
I wasn't sure you actually used that.
All the time.
I got this app on my phone that tells me what's overhead,
and then I just use my handy telescope
to find it for myself.
What are we looking at tonight?
Uh, Cassiopeia.
Ah, the African Queen.
Famously beautiful.
But Poseidon banished her into the sky for her vanity.
Seems like there's worse punishments than being up there.
Oh, yeah. You're right.
Prometheus gets his liver pecked out by a bird
every day for all of time.
Yeesh.
How do you know all that?
I like myths.
Yeah?
They're epic, you know?
It's all passion and romance
and love that spans eternity.
This is great.
It's perfect.
I agree.
Do you?
'Cause right now, looking at you under the stars...
‭I think the Greeks had it right.
What, about liver pecking?
About eternity.
I...
I want us to be like this forever.
Nina Holiday...
will you marry me?
Yeah!
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
I forgot the rolls.
I got the rolls.
Okay.
Okay, I need another beer.
I got it.
Who gave him sugar? Ma?
I gave him some juice.
What kind of juice?
A...popsicle.
A popsicle?
Ma, you can't give him a popsicle for dinner!
Look, there need to be some ground rules
if we're gonna be living here.
You mean it?
Yeah, the professor said yes.
So, my daughter is gonna be out of harm's way.
My grandson will be living right next door.
Wow. It's a gift from heaven.
What about your son?
Yeah, what about your other son?
Yeah, we're gifts from heaven, too, right, Ma?
Yeah, yeah. Shut it and eat your bucatini.
You okay?
Oh. Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm just distracted.
The baby's improving, right?
Yes -- on every level.
And her labs are almost normal.
Most people would say that with a smile.
I know. I know.
But it just doesn't make sense,
and I'm having a hard time accepting it.
Okay.
Come with me.
Where are we going?
Just a place I like to think.
Uh, we'll be right back. Okay?
Uh, Ma, we'll be right back. We'll be right back.
Oh, yeah. Crouton hoops. Hit me. Hit me.
That was amazing.
Okay, cut it out, cut it out.
Don't let him -- Don't show him that. Come on.
Terri, bring me the broom.
I know I should just be happy,
and I'm. Ana is gonna live a long
and healthy life. It's just...
It bothers me that I can't explain it.
You know, Maura, some things don't have an explanation.
Yeah, but the science was indisputable.
There was no reason to expect
an improvement, much less a recovery.
And yet it happened.
Look, I'm not gonna say it was a miracle.
Sometimes I like to...play a game,
"What if it didn't happen."
For example,
what if my apartment didn't burn down?
Then you wouldn't have moved into the professors's townhouse.
Exactly, and then Tommy and T.J.
wouldn't have a place to live that's close to Ma.
I like this. Do another one.
Okay...
What if you didn't have your brain injury?
If I hadn't gotten hurt, then maybe I wouldn't
have pursued other experiences, like working at the clinic.
Then the baby wouldn't have had you there.
So, everything happens for a reason?
Whether we can explain it or not.
We're all...part of a bigger plan.
A very unsicentific explanation.
Maybe, but it...
helps me get through things.
Like leaving home?
Yeah.
I'm gonna need more science
to make myself feel better about that.
Okay.
Yeah, no, I got nothing.
I'm still not gonna say it was a miracle.
Doesn't mean that wasn't.
