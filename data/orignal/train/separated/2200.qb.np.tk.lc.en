i missed you .
i missed you , too .
so , after the wedding ,
how long are you planning on staying ?
how long do you want me to stay ?
i &apos;m gonna ask catherine to marry me .
hey , buddy , that &apos;s great , huh ?
hey , hey , i &apos;m driving here ! what , are you crazy ?
yeah , it &apos;s good .
got here as quick as i could .
kono , how &apos;s adam ?
he &apos;s still in surgery .
but even if he pulls through ,
gabriel got away with the money
that was meant to buy his freedom from the yakuza .
we had two yakuzas sitting outside our house yesterday .
they &apos;re back .
turn off the car and put your hands out the window
so i can see them .
do it now !
you okay ?
yeah .
any idea who these guys were ?
yakuza . no i.d.
i scanned their prints ,
but i got no hits here or internationally .
it just means they &apos;re good .
not good enough .
look , if goro shioma &apos;s putting muscle outside your house ,
it means he &apos;s sending you a message .
he wants his money .
the only problem is gabriel has it .
and he wasn &apos;t gonna let these two guys have it , either .
you think gabriel took these guys out ?
yeah , keep shioma &apos;s focus on me and adam ,
while gabriel reestablishes himself .
all right , i &apos;m putting hpd on your house .
we need to get word to shioma before he retaliates .
he &apos;s got to know that you had nothing to do with this .
sorry i woke you up so early .
i &apos;m glad you did .
yeah ?
okay , go back to sleep .
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna make us some eggs .
yes , ma &apos;am .
okay .
eric !
whoa ! what the hell ? !
just @-@ just wake up .
what ... what time is it ?
it is time for you to buy your own personal alarm clock .
i got my own one , uncle d.
that &apos;s funny .
then why am i up at 5 : 45 in the morning ?
backup .
i don &apos;t want to be late my first day of work .
hey , you know , i @-@ i really appreciate you hooking me up
with this job at the crime lab , you know ?
so i want to show you my commitment
with on @-@ time punctuality .
&quot; on time &quot; and &quot; punctuality &quot; mean the same thing , you big putz .
okay .
did you or did you not tell me i need to crush this job
or you &apos;re gonna ship my ass back to jersey in a crate .
you &apos;re paraphrasing , but i said something like that , yeah .
so a solid first impression is key .
i keep my job . i move out .
i get my own place .
win @-@ win for both of us .
you see ?
you were gonna be up anyways .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re related .
the victim &apos;s name is ben lahinea .
he owns a coral art gallery in waikiki .
i &apos;ve actually seen some of his work .
he goes in the ocean-- mostly rock piles surf break--
and uncovers long lost items that have been encrusted in coral
and turns them into unique art pieces .
okay , enough with the art history lesson , please .
hey , don &apos;t pay any attention to him , max , okay ?
he &apos;s just mad that he didn &apos;t listen to me when i told him
to rent a separate apartment for his nephew .
i told him three times .
are you gonna lend me the money to do that ?
&apos;cause you know i don &apos;t have it .
you know ? go on .
i didn &apos;t mean to snap at you .
please .
your apology &apos;s accepted , detective .
go on , max .
oh , yes .
uh , well , a commercial fishing boat , uh ,
discovered our victim . floating in the ocean .
a gsw to the chest .
his kayak was recovered by the coast guard .
but unfortunately none of his salvage items were in it .
all right , so , uh ,
this guy finds something he &apos;s not supposed to find .
the killer takes it , puts a bullet in him ,
and drops him , uh , in the ocean .
a good theory , but highly unlikely .
the shape and depth of the entry wound
suggests that the bullet was traveling at an unusually
slow trajectory when entering the body .
that , coupled with the fact there was water in his lungs ,
would indicate he was shot underwater .
and there &apos;s also this .
oh , and who is that ?
that is a john doe murder ,
unsolved from six weeks ago .
his body washed up at the ala moana beach .
what , you think they &apos;re connected ?
undoubtedly .
the bullet that killed ben lahinea
was a direct ballistics match to the slug
that i recovered from our john doe .
you &apos;re saying these two guys
were killed with the same gun ?
that is correct , gentlemen .
find the gun , and you &apos;ll solve both murders .
these are really heavy .
put your back into it , ani .
you get what you paid for , jerry .
well , how about i up you to 50 cents a box ?
can you afford that ?
relax . i &apos;m on the government payroll now .
hi , chin .
jerry , you do know that child labor
is illegal in this country ?
he &apos;s not working . he &apos;s a paid intern .
what he learns from me will benefit him
in the workforce one day .
i &apos;ll be right back , jerry .
&quot; cable television :
how the government expanded their subversive tool . &quot;
kids gonna be way more prepared
for the real world than i ever was .
uh , listen .
i just came in to check and see
how your new office is coming along .
um , got everything you need ?
it &apos;s coming along .
okay , anything i can do for you ?
well , since you brought it up ,
while i &apos;m stoked you guys finally came to your senses
and brought me into the fold ,
i was kind of thinking that i was gonna be upstairs ,
you know , with the big boys .
yeah .
and girl .
right .
look , uh , i &apos;m really sorry about that .
but space is actually really tight upstairs .
this is the best we can do .
okay , cool .
well , i &apos;ll make it work .
ooh , here we go .
actually , you can relax .
it &apos;s not work .
this is chin ho kelly .
yes , i appreciate you returning my call .
i have a message for mr. shioma
from adam noshimuri and kono kalakaua .
are we lost ?
no , we &apos;re not lost .
why ?
&apos;cause you got a look on your face like we are lost ,
like you don &apos;t know where the hell we &apos;re going .
catherine , man .
ah , that was gonna be my next question .
what happened ?
well , i overhear her on the phone this morning , all right ?
and she &apos;s talking to somebody in afghanistan .
and you think that she &apos;s what--
maybe getting ready to leave again ?
yeah .
i do .
did she say that ?
no .
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , my pashto &apos;s a little rusty ,
but there was something in her voice .
did you ask her about it ?
no .
of course you didn &apos;t .
you gotta ask her about it , steve .
first things first .
you gotta confront her and see what &apos;s going on .
okay . and say what ? &quot; hey , honey .
so i was listening in on your phone call and ... &quot;
you don &apos;t got to worry about that .
that phone call was a , uh , house casualty .
a &quot; house casualty &quot; ?
yeah .
what is a &quot; house casualty &quot; ?
it means that it happened in your house ,
so it &apos;s , you know , everything &apos;s fair game .
you know what i mean ?
yeah .
like , she made a call , you just happened to overhear it .
yeah , she &apos;s in my ... i &apos;m not eavesdropping .
no .
it &apos;s my house .
that &apos;s my point .
it &apos;s a no @-@ fault &quot; violation &quot; of privacy . you see ?
she can &apos;t get upset about that .
but still , if she &apos;s thinking of leaving ,
she must have her reasons .
yeah , but it &apos;s a reason
that i believe that she should be sharing
with the guy that &apos;s potentially gonna ask her to marry him .
well ...
i &apos;m not doing that anymore .
i can &apos;t ask her to marry me if she &apos;s thinking of leaving .
what am i , an idiot ?
why is the glass always half empty ?
what do you know about that phone call ?
maybe she was calling those people that she helped out
to see how they &apos;re doing .
maybe she was saying &quot; happy birthday . &quot;
you don &apos;t know what that call was about .
and what ? you &apos;re just gonna throw everything away
behind a misunderstanding ? that &apos;s insane .
uh , you make a good point , i guess .
of course i make a good point ,
because i am not the type of person
who freaks out at the first sign of uncertainty .
no , you ... no , you are not .
maybe i am that type of person .
that &apos;s not the point .
the point is this :
figure out what &apos;s going on ,
put a ring on the girl &apos;s finger and that &apos;s that . okay ?
nahele picked it up today .
that &apos;s good .
do not abort this mission , do you understand me ?
yes , sir .
here we are , buddy . rock piles .
this is where ben lahinea &apos;s wife said he went diving .
why is it rock pi ...
i don &apos;t see any piles . i don &apos;t see any rocks .
seriously , who names these surf breaks anyways ?
we &apos;re in the middle of the ocean .
i don &apos;t see any signs . do you see any signs ?
maybe we passed a sign ,
but i don &apos;t think so .
i @-@ i mean , what &apos;s with this place ?
everything &apos;s ... every place got to have a name ?
i &apos;ll tell you what . why don &apos;t you contemplate that for a second ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
all right , so how &apos;d it go with shioma ?
did he believe you ?
i don &apos;t know .
but you know what ? he &apos;d be crazy to think
that you killed two of his people outside your house .
all right , so what &apos;s our next move ?
well , shioma gave us a week to find gabriel
and prove that he was the one behind all this .
we &apos;ve been looking for gabriel a long time .
what &apos;s another week ?
well , it &apos;s more time than we had this morning , right ?
listen , kono ,
we will find gabriel .
and we will get shioma his money back
so you and adam can finally move forward .
i promise you .
hey , guys .
hey , where you going ?
i &apos;m going to the crime lab . you want to come with me ?
isn &apos;t it eric &apos;s first day ?
it is .
that &apos;s why i &apos;d like you to come ,
so i don &apos;t punch him in the mouth .
pretty sweet , huh ?
i &apos;ve only been on the gig a few hours
and i &apos;m already at the center of an epic murder investigation .
i blame stella .
that &apos;s my sister .
all right , eric , why don &apos;t you tell us what you have ?
right .
most of these items have a crazy amount of porolithon buildup .
it &apos;s a genus of coralline algae .
it makes up the majority of hawaiian reef structures .
also , it grows very quickly over hard surfaces ,
leaving a thin layer of coral , like crust .
impressive , right ?
yeah , it &apos;s impressive .
um , but if i were you , i would maybe , um ,
ease back on the energy drinks
and just bring it down a notch .
just &apos; cause there &apos;s people around , you know ?
right .
porolithon . it grows at a rate of
three millimeters a month , give or take .
so most of these items have been under the water way over a year .
however , the gun and the keys
have significantly less buildup .
my calculations put them under the water
the same amount of time-- about six weeks .
all right . our john doe washed up on shore six weeks ago .
okay . so whoever the killer is dumps the body ,
gun and the keys in the water at the same time .
right . and these things stay there
until ben lahinea finds them this morning .
lahinea &apos;s bag has a tear in it .
i mean , the gun could have slipped out
and accidentally discharged .
okay .
that &apos;s a decent theory explaining lahinea &apos;s death ,
but it does not tell us who killed our john doe .
i can maybe help you out with that .
you don &apos;t have to raise your hand , you can just talk .
all right . well , the revolver &apos;s serial number &apos;s
completely scratched off .
illegible .
but ...
i could probably lift it if you give me some time .
it &apos;s pretty bad .
you can do that ?
sugar lips ,
a little hydrochloric acid and crystalline chloride ,
i can do anything .
except breathe with a busted nose , okay ?
do not call her &quot; sugar lips . &quot; ever .
got it . less caffeine , tone down the misogyny .
i &apos;m all over it .
let us know if you find something , please .
all right !
look at that .
nahele , i really appreciate
you picking this up for me today , all right ?
&apos;a &apos; ole pilikia .
i mean , it don &apos;t seem too right
to spend all that money on an allotrope of carbon .
an allotrope of carbon ?
glad you haven &apos;t been ditching your science class .
i mean , look , you could spend all that money on a new truck .
yes , i could .
but , uh , i wouldn &apos;t trade what i got for anything .
before you go all mushy on me , i &apos;m gonna get outta here .
you &apos;ll know what i &apos;m talking about one day , buddy .
and here i thought you were a car guy .
later , commander .
hey , all right , so we ...
what was that you put under your arm , there ?
does it ... is that the thing ?
is this the thing ?
it &apos;s a thing .
well , you gonna let me see it ?
yeah , sure . you can see it .
all right .
look at you .
look at that !
catherine is gonna love this .
too bad she &apos;s gonna have to wait to get it , though .
what are you talking about ?
i just got off with the crime lab .
eric managed to get a serial number off the murder weapon .
the gun is registered to eddie brooks .
he manages a gun range in koko head .
look , i already told you i didn &apos;t kill anyone .
we know .
your alibi checked out .
so you &apos;re gonna let me outta here ?
no .
no , you see , it &apos;s amazing
what we can learn by doing a simple background check .
for instance , that you bought 15 guns this year .
and i have a permit for every one of them .
there &apos;s no crime in being a collector .
that &apos;s true .
but see , then we had hpd toss your place
and they didn &apos;t find one gun .
now , don &apos;t you find that a little strange
for a gun collector , eddie ?
you see , eddie , you &apos;re what we call a straw man .
you buy guns and you sell them to people
who can &apos;t get them for themselves .
and one of those guns was used in a murder ,
which makes you an accessory .
and for that , you &apos;re going to prison , mr. second amendment .
unless , of course , you want to cooperate
with your two new best friends , here .
what do you want to know ?
everything .
who &apos;d you sell this gun to ?
i don &apos;t remember .
look , people pay cash , i don &apos;t keep a log .
that &apos;s too bad ,
because this gun you sold killed two men .
now you got two choices :
either you tell us who you sold that gun to ,
or you &apos;re going into a box .
wait , wait .
that &apos;s the guy i sold that gun to .
you sure about that ?
positive .
his name &apos;s miko mosley .
look at this mess .
must be , uh , must be the maid &apos;s day off .
whoa . check this out .
couple paintings here by , um ...
well , some artist i can &apos;t pronounce .
these things are worth 100 grand a pop .
you believe it ?
miko &apos;s got expensive taste .
i &apos;ll run &apos; em through hpd burglary and theft
and ncic .
see what we get .
damn .
i don &apos;t get it . this guy , he &apos;s living like a homeless person ,
but he &apos;s rolling like mayweather .
well , you know what they say--
better to look good than to live good .
who says that ?
me .
find anything else out there ?
yeah . more evidence of money this man doesn &apos;t have .
hey , lou , come here for a minute .
this brother got his own atm machine .
i mean , he &apos;s printing money .
he &apos;s bleaching the ink off ones ,
and he &apos;s turning them into hundreds .
he was playing a part .
he bought all these expensive clothes , a bunch of artwork ,
got himself a gun .
i think miko mosley was trying to impress somebody .
well , maybe that somebody didn &apos;t buy into his ruse
and put a bullet in his head .
hey , danny .
thanks for coming out to meet me .
no problem .
good to see you .
you , too .
is everything all right ?
yeah , everything &apos;s good .
i just thought we should have a conversation .
okay .
nice view .
oh , come on , bring it .
just bring it .
steve has been very happy since you &apos;ve been back .
me too .
that &apos;s good ,
&apos;cause i think that that &apos;s what he likes ,
when you are happy here , you know ?
i am .
then don &apos;t leave again .
where did that come from ?
i ... does steve know that you &apos;re here right now ?
no , he does not ,
and he would kill me if he did ,
so please don &apos;t tell him .
catherine , i &apos;m just looking out for my boy , all right ?
when you left last time , he was hurt , pretty bad .
okay ? he walked around trying to pretend like he wasn &apos;t ,
but i could see it .
he was suffering .
you know , you don &apos;t walk away
from the kind of relationship that the two of you had .
the relationship that you have .
look , i didn &apos;t mean to hurt him , danny .
steve understood why i had to stay behind in afghanistan .
he knew that that was really important to me .
i know he understood it .
that does not mean that it didn &apos;t wreck him , you know ?
yeah .
look , i @-@ i have no idea what he was like before i met him ,
but i can tell you now
that he is the best version of himself when you are around .
you &apos;re a good friend , danny .
well , if it wasn &apos;t me standing here ,
it &apos;d be chin , it &apos;d be lou , it &apos;d be kono .
look , the point is this , all right ?
last couple years , he &apos;s been through a lot ,
and i just , i just think he deserves to be happy .
i know , i know .
so that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m asking-
are you gonna stick around for good ?
there is nothing that i want more .
that is fantastic news . come on .
so chin &apos;s got everyone working on finding gabriel , all right ?
so trust me , adam .
it &apos;s a small island-- he &apos;ll resurface .
okay .
oh , uh , i got to go , so i &apos;ll see you tonight ?
okay . love you .
ball and chain , huh ?
it &apos;s cool , we don &apos;t got to talk about it .
me , i &apos;m not getting married till i &apos;m 50 .
you know , clooney style .
slay &apos; em when i &apos;m young , i &apos;ll settle down when i &apos;m old .
right , yeah , &apos; cause you and clooney have so much in common .
burn . nice .
okay .
uh , anyway , i , uh , did a comparison on those keys
that were dumped in the ocean ,
and i was able to figure out the types .
padlock , boat key , house key .
okay , great .
miko washed up on shore ,
so the killer could have used a boat to dump the body ,
and somehow the keys ended up in the water .
yeah , if that &apos;s the case , though ,
how &apos;d your killer get back to shore ?
he could have had a spare set .
either way , let &apos;s focus on the boat key .
see if you can find a make and a model .
easy .
great .
uh , actually , officer kalakaua ,
there &apos;s another reason i called you down here .
yeah , what is it ?
uh , one of the items in ben lahinea &apos;s bag was a gopro .
now , judging by the coral and the degradation ,
this thing &apos;s been in the ocean more than a year ,
but i was able to recover some footage .
now , my uncle says you &apos;re a surfer ,
so i was kind of hoping maybe you can help me i.d. this guy .
oh , you know him .
yeah , his name is eli hoku .
we used to surf pipeline together .
last year he was chasing a south swell ,
and , uh , he drowned near a break called rock piles .
i &apos;m sorry .
this must have been taken the day he died .
uh , do me a favor-- make me a copy of this ?
yeah , you got it .
okay . good job . thanks .
all right , so the background check on miko came back clean ,
although he did have some serious debt .
yeah , we ran his credit cards .
it turns out he tried to rent in kahala six weeks ago
using an online rental service , but his card was declined .
so we contacted the owner , a guy named philip kanae .
now , kanae agrees to rent him the house for cash .
place went for $ 5,000 a week .
okay , but miko &apos;s broke .
so he goes and prints some money to pay for it .
what if kanae found out ?
right , and he kills miko with his own gun ,
and then put some distance between himself and the murder weapon .
airline tickets show he left hawaii last month .
just got back a few days ago
could have been laying low until things settled down .
how do we find him ?
all right , i got two addresses for him .
we got the rental property in kahala ,
and we got a permanent address in diamond head .
okay , fine , danny and i &apos;ll go to diamond head ,
see if we can find kanae , have a little chat .
you guys go to the rental property ,
see if you can find anything
that links kanae to the murder of miko mosley .
philip kanae .
clear .
clear .
clear . clear .
there &apos;s nobody here .
whoa , danny , take a look at this .
look at that-- perv tv .
hey , steve .
hey , chin . turn around .
now look up .
cheese .
any sign of kanae there ?
no , place is empty . you ?
no , same here .
i &apos;ll check it out .
listen , contact hpd ,
have &apos; em put an apb out on this guy , okay ?
if he didn &apos;t kill miko , maybe he saw who did .
think you can forget that apb .
that kanae ?
yeah .
your victim has a fractured skull and broken kneecaps ,
along with multiple contusions across his body .
all right , so he was beaten to death , thrown in the pool .
what about tod ?
well , liver temperature indicates
approximately 72 hours ago .
hey , guys . damn .
somebody tony soprano @-@ ed the hell out of this guy , huh ?
eric . ho &apos;omaika &apos;i &apos; ana .
it means , &quot; congratulations . &quot;
i totally knew that .
well , i am positive
that nepotism had nothing to do with the hire .
thanks , max ... i think .
what the hell is he talking about ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
this is the part where you tell us why you are here .
right .
i found something on kanae &apos;s laptop .
lead the way .
all right , so i &apos;ve been going through the files ,
and it turns out kanae has been recording all of his renters .
now , i &apos;m talking everything , and i mean everything .
everything , huh ?
yeah .
except someone recently went through all the files
and deleted a day &apos;s worth of footage from six weeks ago .
six weeks ago , that &apos;s when miko was renting the place .
right , so kanae witnesses miko &apos;s murder ,
the killer finds out ,
decides to get rid of all the evidence , including kanae .
yeah , but why wait until now to baby seal him ?
eric .
what ? too graphic ?
i mean , it &apos;s inappropriate .
you see , he &apos;s right there , all right ?
i got it ; you &apos;re right ,
i got it , all right ?
the question still stands-- why kill him now ?
because he just got back into town .
right . we need that deleted footage .
can you do that ?
does kim kardashian sleep on her stomach ?
okay .
danny , you got to help him .
buddy , you &apos;re an hr nightmare , okay ?
stop .
sorry , uncle d.
and don &apos;t call me &quot; uncle , &quot; don &apos;t call me &quot; d. &quot;
not in public , okay ?
okay , you got it .
don &apos;t bow to me , don &apos;t do any ... just relax .
all right , lunch is served .
my newest culinary achievement
about to debut on my new menu--
shrimp pot pie .
what the heck is this place ?
pretty nice , huh ?
you gave up a cush gig working at my shrimp truck
with ocean and other views for this dungeon .
well , first of all , i didn &apos;t give up my gig working for you .
i just scaled it back to part @-@ time .
and secondly , don &apos;t let appearances deceive you .
five @-@ o values my input .
i smell bleach .
yeah , i think it used to be a janitor &apos;s closet .
and no windows .
you could lose track of time down here , bruddah .
like caesars palace on the ninth island .
i was thinking more like batcave , but whatever .
anyway , thanks for stopping by and bringing me lunch .
uh , it &apos;s very thoughtful of you .
well , you owe me $ 6.50 , batman .
you &apos;re charging me ?
but i still work for you .
half the time , half the price .
and you know i only accept cash .
okay , time to get to work , jer .
sweet .
what &apos;s up , chin ?
oh , howzit ?
i was just leaving anyway .
this place got me feeling claustrophobic ...
and a little unsettled .
laters .
what &apos;s the case , boss ?
so , crime lab restored
over 24 hours of deleted video footage
of a potential murder ...
yeah , it was all me .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m ...
this is eric russo ; he &apos;s our new lab tech .
he &apos;s also detective williams &apos; nephew .
oh , cool .
well , i need the two of you to work together
and comb through that footage
and see if there &apos;s any connection to our murder .
can do .
all right .
hey , how you doing ?
who are you exactly ?
jerry ortega , special consultant , five @-@ o.
god , that feels good to say .
hey , so the boat key that you found in lahinea &apos;s bag
traced back to a 2002 strike 35 fishing boat .
seven are registered on oahu ,
i cleared six of the owners .
what about the seventh ?
it &apos;s registered to a questionable shell corporation .
the owner is aaron james .
he was arrested for drug trafficking ,
but the charges were dropped last year .
all right , so this is the one .
okay .
it doesn &apos;t fit .
sorry , steve . must not be the right one .
i don &apos;t know about that .
you said this boat &apos;s 13 years old ?
yeah .
that &apos;s a brand @-@ new ignition .
i got blood .
okay .
so sometime during the body dump , our killer loses his keys ,
and he has to improvise to get back to shore .
right , he doesn &apos;t realize it ,
but he has the vic &apos;s blood on him
when he goes to hot @-@ wire the engine .
okay .
boss .
aaron james !
excuse me , sir ?
mind if we have a word with you ?
kono !
you can stay quiet all you want , aaron ,
but we know that you dumped miko &apos;s body
and we know you killed philip kanae .
like i said , i want my lawyer .
okay , have hpd transport this guy to lockup .
what about my lawyer ?
i &apos;ll make sure you get a cell with a window in it ,
so you can call for him .
now i don &apos;t feel so bad .
i forgot how depressing that room was compared to mine .
jerry , i &apos;m kind of busy .
oh , yeah , about that--
did he tell you what happened ?
no , not yet .
well , i think i can .
check him .
look , man ...
it &apos;s all good .
yeah , we &apos;ll see .
what did i tell you ? no guns .
it &apos;s a precaution .
show me the cash .
looks right to me .
we good ?
these bills aren &apos;t real .
big mistake , pal .
damn .
and that pretty much tells the story .
so kanae gets back into town ,
he checks the footage from his rental ,
he witnesses aaron kill miko .
but instead of reporting it to police ,
kanae decides to blackmail him .
yeah . and we got the evidence to prove it .
we found text messages
between kanae and aaron james .
looks like they were setting up a time
to meet at kapiolani park .
all right . somewhere , aaron changes his mind ,
goes to the house in diamond head ,
kills him and erases the video .
don &apos;t forget the cliffhanger .
what cliffhanger ?
every good story has a new dilemma for its heroes ,
this included . watch .
yeah , it &apos;s me . the buyer didn &apos;t pan out .
i took care of him .
voila . your cliffhanger .
looks like aaron &apos;s working for someone .
right , but clearly he &apos;s scared of whoever it is .
that &apos;s why he wouldn &apos;t talk .
all right , so we &apos;ll just go have a chat with him
after he gets through booking .
all right . in the meantime ,
i &apos;ll pull aaron &apos;s cell phone records .
maybe we can get us a hit
on who he was calling in that video .
god , i love this table .
what &apos;s up , lou ?
that was duke .
somebody hit the hpd transport with aaron aboard .
they killed two officers and extracted him .
aaron &apos;s gone .
who would be crazy enough to pull off a stunt like that ?
guys , i got a hit on that phone .
it &apos;s a burner .
call it . run a trace .
who is this ?
chin , run that little snippet through voice recognition .
see if we can get something .
