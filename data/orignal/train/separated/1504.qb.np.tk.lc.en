let me get that , husband .
after a storybook wedding
and a magical honeymoon ,
mitchell and i are finally newlyweds .
are you sure you wouldn &apos;t be more comfortable
in your own chair ?
there &apos;s no more &quot; my chair &quot; or &quot; your chair . &quot;
so we got back from our honeymoon several weeks ago ,
and it feels like it never --
never ended ? oh , my gosh .
it &apos;s like we have one mind and one heart .
and one chair .
happy three @-@ month anniversary .
oh , is that today ?
so , listen , i have this boring cocktail thing at the office ,
but i should be home by 6 : 00,
and then we can head to the party .
for you , dad . from dad . again .
flowers ? but you just got me flowers yesterday .
well , you also had cereal yesterday .
and i wouldn &apos;t mind having some today .
sure was nice when this house wasn &apos;t full of bees .
more syrup for milady ?
why , thank you , kind sir .
claire , do we still have any of those cookies that you and luke baked ?
are we the kind of family that has cookies for breakfast ?
yes , we are !
yeah ! yeah !
a butterfly !
oh , my god !
we are having ...
... the most perfect summer ...
... ever .
don &apos;t get me wrong ,
the dunphys have had some great days .
we just have a little trouble stringing them together .
our record was eight consecutive blissful days --
december 2007 .
it was our hanukkah .
this summer , all the dunphys are just clicking .
yeah , haley and luke are getting along ,
alex is off building houses for the poor .
which i know sounds awful , but she loves it .
my fashion blog is blowing up .
i started doing these live video chats ,
and now i have over 50,000 subscribers !
oh , plus , my hair has never looked better .
i &apos;m not a religious person ...
but i just woke up .
phil has been gardening .
i &apos;ve had time to catch up and read the classics .
... when she isn &apos;t busy helping me
with my magic @-@ mirror disappearing trick .
i &apos;m just gonna say it -- suddenly , i love magic .
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the middle of the day .
i just want to put you in a box
and stick swords in you .
if this summer wasn &apos;t magical enough ,
i haven &apos;t had a single bad plum !
oh , my god !
so , the zipper --
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
manny !
manny !
come ! talk to your cousins !
hola !
manny , why you freeze the colombians ?
if i talk to one of them ,
i have to talk to 50 of them .
just do it as a birthday gift .
you always do this .
your birthday &apos;s not till next week .
not mine .
it &apos;s aunt rosario &apos;s 82nd birthday today .
that &apos;s why all the goats are wearing the party hats .
look !
manny !
hi , everyone .
pretty snazzy new cheaters , huh ?
five bucks .
i know , right ? !
my husband is an older man ,
but he &apos;s not an old man .
but with the track suit and -- and now the glasses ,
it &apos;s like he just stopped trying lately .
comfort is not everything .
my toes have been numb since my quinceanera .
we don &apos;t have to be at drinks till 5 : 00,
so i &apos;m gonna run a few errands ,
take these bad boys for a spin .
ay , jay , why don &apos;t you wear that new outfit that i just got you ?
uh , a little flashy , that extra zipper .
like a staircase to nowhere .
yeah , but it makes you look very --
honey , i &apos;m so sorry . right on your toes .
it &apos;s fine . you can drop a pay phone on my foot .
i don &apos;t feel a thing anymore .
and now , as my lovely assistant joins me ,
it &apos;s time to chant the incantation
that will send this fair maiden into the sixth dimension .
by the hat of merlin , by the witches of gramanthia ,
we do make this offering to you -- be gone !
did i do it ? did i disappear ?
almost . just a little bit of forehead .
oh , i can scrunch down .
there &apos;s love .
hey , guys .
sweet ! you brought the sifter .
now i can start my rhubarb pie .
ooh , can i help pick the rhubarb ?
lead the way , kitten .
anybody want a plum ?
i &apos;m good .
i &apos;ll grab you a roadie .
there is no easy way to ask this ,
but are you all high ?
no , mitchell . we &apos;re happy .
oh , i &apos;m trying to get away from &quot; happy . &quot;
all right , in the briefest possible way ,
why don &apos;t you let me know what &apos;s going on ?
okay , cam refuses to let the honeymoon end .
i have a house full of flowers , endless romantic texts .
i know , i know , i sound like an ungrateful jerk .
you do .
it &apos;s exhausting .
not to mention impossible to reciprocate .
oh , my god !
um , anyway ,
do you think that maybe i should talk to him gently
about taking it down a notch ?
no , absolutely not . that never ends well .
clearly you thought this said &quot; be mean . &quot;
phil , honey , no .
no .
it &apos;s -- okay , don &apos;t worry , i ...
and it wasn &apos;t even valentine &apos;s day .
so your advice is to do nothing .
yes , mitchell , as horrible as this sounds ,
you need to suck it up and let yourself be loved ,
and cam will end up dialing back the romance .
you might just miss it .
i know i do .
here we are . a plum for my peach .
do you ?
here you go .
thank you .
is he okay ?
he &apos;s mitchell .
look , i didn &apos;t even want to talk about it .
we &apos;ve had such a great thing going on here .
i don &apos;t want to let that kind of negativity in the house .
alex !
we didn &apos;t think you were coming back until next week .
i got a ride home early .
this has been the worst summer ever !
careful , you idiot !
you &apos;re an idiot !
and last night , my tent ripped ,
so i had to sleep
under a plywood board leaning up against a van .
pass me a napkin .
is milady &apos;s arm broken ?
yours is about to be .
aww , precious flowers .
not that i could sleep with all the rats .
and , by the way ,
if any of you start coughing up blood , my bad .
i think i brought back the plague .
what am i doing ?
i think i left my backpack in the driveway .
stop kicking me !
you &apos;re kicking me !
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just fidgety today .
it &apos;s okay .
a cookie might help .
here &apos;s that napkin you wanted .
i got the mail !
would it have killed you
to give me one without ketchup on it ?
move !
you have room !
no , move out ! you &apos;re 40 !
okay . that &apos;s enough .
luke , why don &apos;t you go water our garden .
haley , just disappear for a minute .
well , it &apos;s not like you could help with that .
abracad @-@ ouch .
well , it &apos;s great having alex home , huh ?
so great .
you don &apos;t think that she &apos;s the reason why we --
no . no , i do not .
we both knew that this charmed summer
had to have a bump in it somewhere .
yes . yeah .
and it &apos;s not like alex coming home
could suddenly throw off our whole happy mojo .
how &apos;s that plum ?
great . oh , my god .
there she is !
there she is !
oh , so happy to have you home , honey .
oh , my god ! it &apos;s a bat !
what &apos;s happening ? !
get it out of house !
get it away !
this is unbelievable .
the dry cleaner lost another one of my shirts .
you know that nice ,
red @-@ white @-@ and @-@ blue hawaiian one ?
yes , that was a very nice one .
that &apos;s the fourth hawaiian shirt he &apos;s lost .
i &apos;m telling you ,
this is a &quot; dateline &quot; story waiting to happen .
great talking with you all ,
hey , but someone wants to say hi .
no , no !
jay !
hi , guys .
nope , still don &apos;t speak spanish .
always so much fun seeing you guys , though .
listen , i --
gloria ?
hmm ?
your cousin &apos;s wearing
my black , yellow , and peach hawaiian shirt .
ay , please , jay !
like you &apos;re the only man
in this whole wide world that owns that shirt .
these designer specs don &apos;t
just make my eyes pop .
i can see the cigar burn i put on the left pocket .
it &apos;s a coincidence .
there &apos;s a lot of those .
like according to your uncle &apos;s hoodie here ,
he was on my track team at buchanan high .
hey , guys . tell you what .
why don &apos;t we sample some american food for a change ?
so , you &apos;re sending my clothes to colombia ?
just the old ones , and --
and they send most of them back .
and there it is .
do you have a problem with the way i dress ?
jay , i love you very , very much .
and i love you very much , but that wasn &apos;t the question .
it &apos;s just that sometimes i feel like
you could make a bigger effort on your appearance .
and there it is .
please stop saying that .
it &apos;s just that i feel that lately
you don &apos;t make an effort to look good for me ,
and i &apos;m always making an effort to look my best for you .
for me ? sure .
what ?
well , let &apos;s face it , you don &apos;t really doll up for me --
you do it for you .
you get your hair done , you get your nails done .
oh , so you wouldn &apos;t mind if i stopped fixing myself up ?
no , because i love you for you .
and since we &apos;re being honest ,
i actually think sometimes ...
you overdo it .
and there it is .
you &apos;re using it wrong .
no , this is good .
it &apos;s good to know that -- that you don &apos;t care .
this is gonna save me so much time in the future .
good .
good !
manny !
why ?
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s clich√© ?
i love the convenience of a nice mini quiche .
you got a little , um ...
oh , no . okay . perfect .
can the new guy embarrass himself any more ?
hey , counselor .
what do i have to do to get you to drop that suit ?
cam , what are you doing here ?
surprising my &quot; hugsband &quot; !
i &apos;m hearing that term for the first time .
yeah .
so when will you guys be back ?
looks like somebody &apos;s entertaining a lady friend .
maybe you &apos;ll pour her a nice , tall glass of manny @-@ schewitz ?
you know what ? sometimes just a straight answer .
gloria , can i get an e.t.a. ?
these are important clients .
i &apos;d like them to still be alive when we get there .
okay ! i &apos;m ready .
seriously ?
what ?
ay , no ! i &apos;m so sorry !
i forgot this was drinks with your clients .
hold on . okay .
i &apos;m ready now . let &apos;s go .
hey , there , superstar .
moron !
derp !
it really hasn &apos;t been the same here without you .
so what do you got there ?
oh , college brochure !
you &apos;re gonna have your pick of schools .
you &apos;re our little genius .
i just hope --
what , claire ? what do you hope ?
well , you have such a perfect record ,
i hope they don &apos;t hold it against you
that this week you kinda ... well ...
don &apos;t want to say &quot; quit . &quot;
you just did .
are you trying to send me back to that hellhole ?
no ! it &apos;s -- honey , you &apos;re part of a team ,
and there are people relying on you ,
so when you just up and vanish like that ,
it sort of -- it --
phil ?
phil ? !
your mom just feels like it &apos;s unlike you
to walk away from something .
at least i could walk away .
my tent @-@ mate nail @-@ gunned her foot to the floor .
she was just walking around in a circle screaming
until someone found her !
why do you guys want to get rid of me so badly ?
no one wants to get rid of you .
it &apos;s just seven more days .
you &apos;ll feel good about finishing something you started ,
and then you join us for the perfect little summer
we &apos;re having here .
were having until an hour ago .
haley !
oh , my god . okay , i see what this is .
you all are happier when i &apos;m not here .
no , that &apos;s not true .
save it !
i &apos;ll get a ride back up there
and you all can continue to enjoy
your perfect , little summer !
alex , honey !
leave me alone !
we just got free cinemax !
here &apos;s mitchell kissing a dolphin .
oh , that &apos;s him kissing a tiger .
i &apos;m the tiger .
we have fun , you know ?
were we supposed to bring our spouses ?
hey , cam ? cam , hey , look .
um , this is kind of work @-@ only .
oh , please . they don &apos;t even know i &apos;m here .
i love this song . let &apos;s dance .
no , no . nobody &apos;s -- nobody &apos;s dancing .
shh . say it with your hips .
o @-@ kay .
hey , uh , no , cam . um ...
you know i love you , right ?
first man that ever did love me right !
we have fun .
we do , we do , we do .
um , so , look , i @-@ i was thinking that maybe ...
we could turn the romance down
just a little bit , you know ?
because it &apos;s been getting a little bit --
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t want to say over the top , but it --
okay , i &apos;m gonna need your help
if we &apos;re gonna keep dancing here .
i feel like you &apos;re mad .
so , we had an informal vote over there ...
we &apos;re not dancing anymore .
oh , good .
you know herb might stop by , right ?
he takes the pictures for the company newsletter .
yes , i love &quot; herb &apos;s blurbs . &quot;
well ...
here come the doors !
usually all the good places have them !
i &apos;m going to open them !
oh , you &apos;re such a gentleman , jay .
i think i forgot my wallet .
oh , don &apos;t worry .
i have some money here in my fanny pack , huh ?
for god &apos;s sake , fine . you win .
i like it when you make yourself pretty .
i win !
i just said you won .
ay , jay , what you &apos;re feeling right now
is what i feel when you stop trying to look good for me .
no , i get it .
then why did you stop trying ?
because ...
oh , forget it . it &apos;s too stupid .
tell me .
a couple of months ago ,
i was shopping at barneys --
you know i like to stay current .
anyhow , i &apos;m coming out of the dressing room ,
and i see these two young guys laughing at me ,
you know , like &quot; there &apos;s the old guy trying too hard . &quot;
you know , of course i get mad .
but i start thinking ,
&quot; they &apos;re right , jay .
you &apos;re old . just be old . &quot;
listen to me , jay pritchett !
a lot of people assume
that i married you because of your money ,
and that &apos;s only a very , very small part of it .
i &apos;d like to go back to that .
i married you because you were sexy .
you still are .
who knows for how long that &apos;s gonna last ,
for either of us .
so we have to keep making an effort for each other .
next time you go to barneys , i go with you .
maybe you &apos;re just making the wrong choices .
not always .
you want to have a drink ? i can change .
no , i think i &apos;ll text them , tell them i was sick .
let &apos;s go home . you said i was sexy .
okay , bye , rosa . thank you .
cam !
what &apos;s up , dude ?
seriously ?
what , is that too romantic for you ?
he loves me not ...
he loves me not ...
he loves me not .
okay , can we talk ?
actually , no . i &apos;m kind of busy .
i &apos;m assuming you forgot it &apos;s our three month @-@ iversary .
well , i foolishly set up a celebration
that i will kindly get rid of .
cam !
no , i didn &apos;t forget ,
but that &apos;s what i want to talk to you about .
you &apos;ve been a little bit --
see , look . this is what i &apos;m talking about .
you got me another present .
don &apos;t touch that .
oh , my -- my heart !
what heart ?
cam ! come on !
okay , listen .
i know how lucky i am to have you ,
but i can &apos;t possibly keep up with this level of affection ...
oh , boy .
i apologize ! i &apos;m a monster !
no , obviously , i &apos;m the monster .
obviously .
you know , can i just point out
that when we were in cabo ,
you didn &apos;t seem to mind all the flowers ...
yeah , but --
or the back rubs ,
or the attention .
well , that -- that was our honeymoon ,
and , yes , i loved it , but it was weeks ago .
well , maybe some of us don &apos;t want it to ... end !
well , it has to eventually end .
all right , cam --
did you have this lipstick or --
you know , personally ,
i feel sorry for you that you &apos;re so shut off
that a few simple romantic gestures --
oh , my god ! what am i looking at here ?
well , i guess i &apos;m crazy ,
because i &apos;ve taken pictures of you sleeping
every night since we got married
because you &apos;re the man of my dreams .
okay , super quick -- if i was the man of your dreams ,
wouldn &apos;t you have to be the one sleeping ?
don &apos;t pull that thread , mitchell .
speaking of which , what is this ?
don &apos;t pull that thread , mitchell .
oh , cam , come on !
even you have to admit this is excessive .
excessive ? really ?
struck by cupid &apos;s magic arrow .
it &apos;s off , lily .
seriously ? two hours rehearsing with rosa ?
cam , what is going on with you ?
we just had the most romantic year ever ,
planning our ceremony , the wedding , the honeymoon ,
and i &apos;m just worried if we let this go ,
we &apos;ll never get it back .
well , that doesn &apos;t all just end .
it did once .
you know , the first two years we were together ,
we were insanely romantic .
then it became about parenting a @-@ and working .
and this last year , we got that back ,
and i just realized i &apos;ve dropped the ball .
oh , no .
well , m @-@ maybe you -- you shouldn &apos;t be the only one
carrying the ball .
what if you did a give @-@ off to me ?
a hand @-@ off .
okay , what -- yeah .
look , w @-@ what if i ...
tried to become a little bit more romantic ?
what would that even look like ?
this song ... this song ...
was playing the night i asked you to move in .
at that applebee &apos;s .
i believe you owe me a dance .
yes .
are we almost done with fairy time ?
lily , of all ...
lily , that &apos;s offensive .
i just want to get out of this costume .
oh . oh , of course .
now , that does look uncomfortable .
they snap off .
they snap off . oh , that &apos;s easy .
my ride &apos;s on its way .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll wait outside on the curb .
honey , nobody wants you to go .
yeah , even if you are bad luck , you &apos;re our bad luck .
you realize that is in no way an apology , right ?
the thing is that we are really --
please stop talking .
i spent this entire summer as an outsider .
they literally made me build the outside of the house .
and then i come back here and i --
why is your webcam on ?
are you trying to humiliate me ?
that light means it &apos;s on ?
it doesn &apos;t automatically turn off
when you go to a different web page ?
no , and considering you keep your laptop on your bed ,
right by where you change ,
and when you come out of the shower ,
and who knows what else ...
everyone knows what else !
it &apos;s probably why you have 50,000 subscribers .
hey ! you should be ashamed of yourselves !
yeah , yeah . still not off .
how do you do that ?
wait , what is that smell ?
your father and luke are making a rhubarb pie
from rhubarb we grew in our own garden .
you &apos;re not leaving until you try it .
no , no , no , no , no . i smell smoke .
well , i didn &apos;t turn the oven on yet .
did you ?
no .
oh , no , no !
i tried to start that stupid &quot; war and peace &quot; again
last night in the bathtub , but then i fell asleep .
it dropped in the water
and i thought i would just dry it out .
take cover !
okay ! okay !
take cover !
oh , god !
damn this thing !
did nobody notice the oven light ? !
lights mean things , people !
great job !
oh , god ! oh , no ! no ! no !
good job , honey !
this has been awesome , but my ride &apos;s here .
have a magical day .
no , no , no , no .
no , i got it .
no , sweetie .
claire , i got this .
okay .
spoon time , people .
yes ! family tradition .
yes .
look , you can leave if you want to , sweetheart ,
but we &apos;re not letting you go without a smile on your face .
luke and i poured a lot of love into this pie ,
so , here ...
taste this .
taste our love .
you took the leaves off the rhubarb , right ?
they &apos;re incredibly poisonous . you all could die .
no ! alex says they &apos;re poison !
we &apos;re right here ! we heard her !
you can &apos;t leave us .
we &apos;re a danger to ourselves .
we &apos;re a family of fire starters ,
poison eaters , and online prostitutes .
it wasn &apos;t a perfect summer .
it was a stupid summer .
without you here to shame me ,
i watched every &quot; real housewives &quot; episode
and i only got to page two in &quot; war and peace . &quot;
please stay .
we need at least one adult in this household .
okay , fine .
you know the attic window is open , right ?
we really didn &apos;t .
i race you up the stairs .
why don &apos;t you slip into something less comfortable ?
okay !
surprise ! surprise ! surprise ! surprise !
just a thought -- maybe we should stop doing these .
what &apos;s going on ?
it seems pretty obvious .
i had to throw the party a week early
to really surprise her .
should we be concerned about her ?
that &apos;s kind of similar to the way mom left .
gloria and i got in this whole thing about how we dress .
long story ,
i think she might need a little more time bef--
hola !
i had this outfit underneath .
did you really think
that i was gonna walk into a bar looking like that ?
gracias !
all these years ,
you &apos;re telling me you can get ready that fast ?

now we &apos;re sharing the --
