第七季 第十五集
In 50 feet, you have arrived at your destination.
Alicia Florrick?
Yes.
I'm Sergeant Cole McWain.
May I see your I.D., please?
Yes.
Thank you.
Would you mind getting in the backseat, please?
My cell phone's ringing. May I answer it?
Yes, you may.
Hello, Eli. I can't talk right now.
The FBI are investigating.
I know.
They're going after Peter.
Wait, how do you know?
Ruth came by my office.
Look, I-I need to go.
Wait. We're hiring a lawyer.
Sounds like the smart thing to do.
Bye.
We need your help.
We think they're coming after Peter again.
This is doctor's orders. I am cursed
with high blood pressure.
Just give me the bullet points.
The FBI is asking questions.
Professional or personal?
Both.
About Peter's conduct
in office or running for office?
Both.
That sounds serious.
Or is it a smokescreen?
Or both.
So...
You need a lawyer to figure out why you need a lawyer?
Yes.
The only thing I know for sure, this...
FBI agent, Devereaux, he's out for blood.
Like Gladiator, huh?
Yes, like Gladiator.
Well, then let's go.
There's no time to waste.
Okay. Good. Just a few more. Diane,
can you look at Cory?
Cary.
Yes, sorry. Cary.
Uh, you, sir, not so much teeth.
Is this the right amount of teeth?
Yes.
Great. Everybody say ABA?
ABA.
Good. Now just the women.
ABA.
No, I mean the men can step out, take five.
Thank you, men.
What's the spin of this ABA article anyhow?
I have no idea.
My guess is: third largest firm in Chicago.
It's not about women in the firm?
No. Why?
They sure are spending a lot of time with the women.
Okay, let's not go there.
All publicity for the firm is good publicity.
No, actually, that's not true.
Okay, good.
So that's it?
Why are we waiting around here like schmucks?
David, he's probably just moving into another room.
Let's calm down.
Are we moving into another room?
No. We're done.
Thanks.
Uh, he's coming back tomorrow.
Yeah, but just to shoot the women.
Thanks, guys. Good shoot.
Great. We'll just go back to the cleaning and cooking.
So, this ABA article,
what's it about?
Well, what do you mean?
The firm, I think.
Women at the firm?
No. Just the firm.
This shoot tomorrow,
he just wants a photo of us with Alicia.
That's all.
She's not an equity partner.
I know. I think it's about name value.
But he just wants the female partners with her?
Cary, it's nothing.
It's just an angle he's pushing.
I don't think anything will come of it. Okay?
Did you need something?
Yeah. Is Alicia out today?
She had that personal thing.
Oh, right. Well, when she calls in,
could you forward her to me?
Yeah.
What are you doing for lunch today?
Eating.
Would you like to eat together? 12:30?
Sure.
I'm sorry.
You'll need to leave your phone and personal effects.
You'll be able to check your messages on breaks.
Please follow me.
Mrs. Florrick, there you are. Welcome.
Please.
We were just getting started. So you're right on time.
Mrs. Florrick, hello.
Captain Hicks.
I didn't know you'd be here.
I see you two know each other. Good.
At the expense of sounding like summer camp,
I wouldn't mind if
we went quickly around the table-- Martin.
Martin Barnstone. Intelligence legal advisor.
And other things.
Martin is our Ollie North.
《纽约时报》畅销作者 前海军陆战队中校
George Kirby. Legal advisor. State Department.
George makes sure we follow the rules.
Captain Terrence Hicks. Army General's Corps Attorney.
And now our two civilian advisors.
Both come highly recommended and vetted.
Alicia Florrick, wife to the governor.
She has worked as civilian counsel in military court
and comes at the recommendation
of Colonel Leora Kuhn. And Ed.
Edward Janoway.
Corporate lawyer with Palmer/Janoway.
I think I'm the fire-breathing conservative
to Mrs. Florrick's bleeding heart.
And I'm Oren Cleary, Legal Counsel
to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
It's a mouthful, I know.
This is a confidential session.
All of the items and materials discussed here
are subject, under penalty of law, to confidentiality rules.
You may take notes during this session, but those notes
must be relinquished before we've finished.
And no items or evidence may be taken
from this room. Understood? Good.
Martin.
As I'm sure you're aware, the executive branch
has taken flack lately for its legal justification
regarding Executive Order 12333.
The president has asked for a broader consensus
on action item 56-984B.
Our two civilian consultants have been granted
TS/SCI clearance to take part.
Please break the seal on your briefing materials now.
On the inside, you will find a photo of Massoud Tahan.
He is an ISIS recruiter in Syria.
Mrs. Florrick, do you need help?
No, I'm good.
In the past two years,
eight Americans, ten Brits, and two dozen Belgians
have joined ISIS due to Tahan's efforts.
They credit his recruitment on social media.
Mr. Tahan limits his appeals
to the religious importance of ISIS establishing a caliphate.
He hasn't specifically promoted violence.
However, his recruits have been behind
some of the worst atrocities we've seen in Iraq and Syria.
Beheadings, bombings, rape.
And what do you need from us?
We know Tahan's location for the next 48 hours.
You have been selected to give the administration
legal justification to kill him.
Jason Crouse. Hello.
Hey.
Good to have you working here.
A new on-site investigator.
How exciting. I just wanted
to introduce myself-- David Lee, family law.
Nice to meet you.
So, hey, there is something I need right away.
You kind of got a cowboy thing going, don't you?
Not intentionally.
Well, I need work that I'll pay for out of my pocket.
Given that you're freelance,
that shouldn't be a problem, should it?
What work?
Diane Lockhart is one of the name partners.
You've heard of her?
I have.
I'm worried she intends to make
Lockhart, Agos & Lee a fully female-run firm.
So I need to know the conversations she's having
with Alicia and the other female partners.
Okay.
That's it? No questions?
No.
Any for me?
No.
So, the people this Agent Devereaux has approached are
Judge Schakowsky, Ruth Eastman,
and Mr. Gold's daughter.
So far, yes.
What's huh?
You and the governor are both wearing maroon ties.
Is that important?
Maroon signifies sacrifice and bravery.
So, Governor, why do you think the FBI is interested in you?
I have no idea.
There must be something that you've walked
right up to the line on.
Believe me, if I had any idea
what this was about, I'd tell you.
Elsbeth, could you give us a minute?
I'll be right outside.
I mean, not outside-outside. Just out... there.
You need to tell her everything.
I am.
You're not.
Eli, we've been together a long time.
Anything that I've done, you've done.
No.
I did not try to fix an election for Alicia.
An FBI investigation is a game-changer, Peter.
All cards need to be on the table.
In a minute, Elsbeth!
Not now, Nora.
The FBI just called.
Tell 'em I'll call back.
It wasn't for you.
It was for me.
The threshold question is this:
Does an ISIS recruiter rise to the level of enemy combatant?
Is that the only way this guy makes it onto the kill list?
Yes, if we want to avoid blowback--
not just political but legal.
Has he ever fired a gun or killed anyone?
No, not to our knowledge.
But his recruits have.
His recruits have killed hundreds.
Tahan's posted dozens of online calls to join ISIS:
Sleuthway, YouTube, Telegram.
But has he ever espoused violence?
No.
Well, the fact that he doesn't
overtly espouse violence just shows
how sophisticated ISIS has become.
But how do you judge that?
He talks about establishing the caliphate,
which makes him more of a preacher
than anything else.
ISIS isn't a religion.
It's a terrorist group with one goal, which is
to convert or kill anyone who doesn't believe what they do.
Yes, but Tahan isn't actually doing these things.
It's his recruits.
Why are you protecting him, Captain?
I'm not protecting anyone.
I'm thinking of the message it sends to other nations
if we call a recruiter an enemy combatant.
Once we do that, what's next?
Targeting imams, college professors?
When they advocate violent attacks on Americans, yes.
Then what's the pushback on Putin when he says
he can take out a Ukrainian YouTube star
who he claims is an agitator?
If the YouTube star is telling people to go to Paris
and shoot up concert halls, I say, go, Putin.
The United States has always held
that a propagandist is not a combatant
and is therefore immune from targeted killing.
No. Look at Junaid Hussain.
He was a propagandist, and we killed him.
So we...
Go ahead, Mrs. Florrick. Please.
So we're supposed to wait until Tahan plans
a successful attack before we stop him?
I take it you don't think we should.
I... I think we need to do everything we can, legally,
to stop ISIS.
I agree with Mrs. Florrick.
Has Tahan purposefully and materially supported hostilities
against the U.S.? That is our only question.
What material has he provided?
Bodies-- you asked how he materially supported the enemy.
He's supplied the bodies for the bombs.
Okay. I think we should vote.
Is Massoud Tahan an enemy combatant
and can he be placed on a targeted kill list?
To my right, please.
Aye.
Aye.
Nay.
Aye.
Aye.
It carries. Massoud Tahan is an enemy combatant
and can be placed on a targeted kill list.
We will write up the legal justification. But first,
there is one other matter.
Sorry I can't agree.
You don't have to apologize. We all have our opinions.
Pass these around, please.
You may break the seals.
This is Lance Hopper.
He was born and raised in Chicago.
Went to Chicago Polytech, where he studied comparative religions.
He disappeared about two years ago.
He resurfaced in Syria
and called himself Massoud Tahan.
So the man you want to kill is an American?
That's correct.
So let's talk.
You may wonder why we did it this way,
waited to tell you that Mr. Tahan was an American citizen.
There are two threshold questions,
and we wanted to answer one before we answered the other.
Everything we said about Tahan was true.
We were merely trying to eliminate bias and emotion.
What's wrong with emotion?
It clouds judgment.
Sometimes it clarifies it.
If Massoud Tahan is an enemy combatant,
then so is Lance Hopper.
But an American has First Amendment rights.
Hopper can say and believe whatever he wants.
He's not in trouble for talking.
He's in trouble for being an enemy combatant.
Yes,
but we only concluded he was an enemy combatant because of what he said.
I'm not sure that's accurate.
Just as Mrs. Florrick put so eloquently,
he supplied materials in the form of bodies to carry bombs.
Still, if he's an American, he gets due process.
Are you withdrawing your support for the targeted strike?
No. But I want to know more.
There's nothing more to know if you still support the targeted strike.
Withdraw your support for the air strike,
and we'll be told more.
I withdraw my support.
Temporarily.
Okay. Let's get started.
Why did you tell the FBI anything?
I'm so sorry.
It's fine, Nora.
Just tell us what you told him.
He wanted to know
who calls here for Eli and who Eli calls.
What'd you tell him?
I said a million calls
go through this office every day,
and I don't write down names.
I didn't say you tell me not to write down names.
Did he ask about anyone specific?
Nora, you can speak freely. Go.
He asked if Judge Schakowsky ever comes by.
That's when I got a bad feeling.
You're kidding. Nora knows.
Nora knows what?
Well, there is one potential... issue.
There always is.
What's yours?
Vote rigging.
Okay.
Let's crack open the green notebook.
That's for serious notes.
Would you like to sit down?
No, I'm good.
It would make me more comfortable.
So, um, are you working on the Van DerWerff divorce?
No.
Well, the reason I ask is
I saw David Lee meeting with you this morning.
I thought it was about the Van DerWerff divorce.
It wasn't.
So he was just introducing himself?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Are you doing freelance work for David Lee?
If I was doing freelance work for David,
I wouldn't be able to tell you.
Same as if I were doing freelance work for you.
I wouldn't be able to tell him.
So he's asking you to do freelance work?
I better get back to work.
Did he ask you to investigate me?
I better get back to work.
David Lee loves to create paranoia and dissension.
Don't help him.
Good to know.
So how are you liking it here?
Fine.
Really?
Fine never sounds very fine.
No, it's fine.
And how's Alicia handling it?
Fine.
Has Diane approached Alicia
about her position at the firm?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Last year, there was an attempt to make this a female-run firm,
and I just wanted to know if there's been a new attempt.
Well, that's a question for Alicia.
But Alicia's MIA today.
And you're Alicia's friend, so I'm asking you.
I'll tell her you want to talk.
Where you headed?
Out for some air. You?
No idea.
This place is insane.
Alicia, it's Cary.
I know you're out today, but I need you to call.
Hey. So this is a weird firm.
I need some advice.
Alicia. Diane.
We need to talk.
Yeah, so... I'll talk to you.
I think you might want to come inside.
We're reviewing Lance Hopper's statements.
...longed for the Caliphate to be restored.
Well, we now have it.
So the righteous and the rightly guided must...
Three conditions must be met
for the targeted killing of a U.S. Citizen.
Please refer to your binders.
First, The individual poses an imminent threat
F violent attack against the United States.
Two, The capture of the individual is not feasible.
And three: the operation
is conducted consistent with applicable law of war principles.
The job of this panel is to decide if the three conditions are met.
We are Lance Hopper's due process.
Okay. Let's talk about imminent.
All of these are past atrocities.
Even if I concede that Tahan--
or, make that, Hopper-- is somehow responsible,
they've already happened.
An imminent threat is necessarily a future one.
Are we aware of any future threats?
Yes. He posted that video two days ago.
But that wasn't a threat.
Yes, but you said so
yourself, ma'am. Re we supposed to wait
until he plans another successful attack??
But the threshold has changed.
Now it's about imminence.
Imminent means seconds, minutes, hours.
No. This administration defines
imminent as anything under 60 days.
Seriously?
Technically, since the enemy
is so good at hiding their attacks,
any future attack is now considered imminent.
According to whom?
The Department of Justice.
That's nothing more than legal wordplay.
No, it's trying to account for the realities of war.
Having spent my career in the army,
I understand the realities very clearly.
The country I serve doesn't try
to weasel out of what it always stood for,
just because it happens to be convenient.
Imminent should mean imminent.
Maybe we should vote again.
Actually, we've got 30 hours to make the decision.
Let's take the night,
and come back in the morning and vote.
Why are we taking the night?
Because we can.
Okay. Hm.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Just wanted to make sure you were settling in okay.
Uh, yup, all... good.
What's this?
Oh, I'm a visual processor.
And slightly kinesthetic-tactile.
What?
What did Ruth Eastman do for the campaign?
Uh, she was the campaign manager.
Strategy, donors, coalitions.
Are you thinking vote rigging?
Could be.
Schakowsky knew, Nora knew.
Did Ruth know?
No, she joined the campaign long after that.
Unless Peter told her.
Campaign managers push their candidates to
admit all before signing on.
So, Ruth... might... have... known.
Aha. So, the question is,
did she?
Who is that? I can't even read that.
Oh, your daughter. Marissa.
Why her?
I have no idea.
Then let's talk to her.
Oh, come on.
So, you're working late.
No later than you.
Just seeing what piled up on my desk.
Want something to drink?
No, I'm all right.
Could you, um...?
Yeah.
So, people really don't trust each other around here, do they?
Not much.
Let me ask you something.
Is Diane trying to make this into an all-female firm?
No idea.
Who's worried? Cary?
Look at that. Very manly.
You sure?
I'm good.
So, Diane's never said anything about it?
An all-female firm?
Uh, maybe a year or so ago,
but a lot's happened.
Do you think I drink too much?
I don't know. Do you?
I was gonna break this bottle
if I couldn't get the cork out.
That might be a problem.
Then here.
Wait. No.
No, no, seriously, you don't need it.
Let's just... let's just talk.
Jason, come on.
You don't need it, seriously.
Okay, yes, but I want it.
Hey, wait... just... try something for a minute.
Close your eyes. Just close 'em.
Take a deep breath.
Slow it down.
If this doesn't work, do I get the glass?
Just... listen to yourself breathe.
I don't meditate, Jason.
Okay, then we won't call this meditation.
Just... listen.
To what?
My breathing.
That's Security.
They turn the lights off after 11:00.
Anything else?
So why did you know about the vote rigging?
Because you were Mrs. Florrick's body woman?
Yes.
Keeper of confidences, you know?
Pourer of comfort cereal.
What kind of cereal?
I don't know. Life.
Wheat Chex. Why?
I like Wheat Chex.
Did Agent Devereaux ask about anything else?
Uh, no.
I guess he asked about my dad's rich friends,
and then he asked about working for Alicia.
And that was it?
Yeah.
Well, he asked about my time in Israel,
and the IDF and the dairy farm I worked on.
And I talked about my purse business.
You sell purses?
No, I make them.
I didn't really end up selling any.
Oh. What did they look like?
The purses?
Really cool.
Kind of macram with leather straps
and things sewn into them.
Wow. What things?
Things I found,
like kewpie dolls and bullet shells.
What?
I have to go.
Where?
Um... away.
I can't be Peter's lawyer.
Wait. What? Why?
Uh, well, I can't really say.
You can't?
Elsbeth, wait. What?!
Bye.
Here's my card.
Write me about your purses.
I want to buy one.
So, you don't want to hire me for anything,
but that's your lawyer?
Alicia Florrick...
Here you go.
Thank you.
Would you mind getting in the...?
No problem.
Good. Mrs. Florrick.
I think we're ready.
Good. I am, too.
Great.
Let's take our seats, and we can pick up where we left off.
The question is: is Lance Hopper an imminent threat
to the United States?
Now, if everyone is prepared to vote, we can move...
Um, I'm sorry, but Captain Hicks--
where is he?
The captain has been excused from these proceedings.
He...? What does that mean?
That means he will not be continuing with us.
Now we should really move on.
Why?
Well, the reasons are confidential, Mrs. Florrick.
We really need to move on.
No. I'm sorry, but I would like to know
why Captain Hicks isn't here,
and I don't think I'm the only one.
Actually, I think you are.
No. I want to know, too.
Everyone here is subject to confidentiality rules,
and the captain is currently being questioned
about certain... leaks.
You're saying he leaked?
No, it's not my position to say he leaked.
I'm merely saying he's being questioned about certain leaks.
Now we need to vote. In 12 hours,
Hopper is going to be moved.
Does he pose an imminent threat of violence against
the United States?
Yes. He does.
Are there any no's?
So it's a tie.
Which I will break with a yes?
So condition one is met. We'll move on to condition two.
Is capture at all feasible?
Why can't you be Peter's attorney?
I can't say.
Does it have something to do with the vote rigging?
Rock once for yes, twice for no.
Namaste.
Elsbeth... give me something.
Fine. But then you really have to go.
What is this?
It's not a what. It's a he.
Michael Tascioni?
My ex.
Nice to meet you.
It's good to have you on board.
I'm sorry that I had to bring Tom,
but, uh, El insists he gets separation anxiety,
and, well, since we share custody...
Uh, your ex-wife came back for her notes.
I-I tried to look at them before, but...
They made no sense?
No. Scribbles, stickers.
She used to do the same thing to pick our vacation spots.
Piles of index cards.
And on top, hello. My name is Sedona.
Hello. My name is Peru.
Drove me nuts.
So we're starting from scratch.
Not entirely.
I can tell you that, uh,
the FBI is not investigating the governor for vote rigging.
They're not?
How can you be so sure?
Because you went into this assuming
that was about vote rigging.
That was the pattern El was trying to trace with her cards.
So if she was conflicted out about that,
then she would've known it from the beginning?
Exactly.
What was being said when she realized she was conflicted out?
Well, she was questioning my daughter,
and they were talking about the IDF,
working on an Israeli dairy farm, uh...
and purses she was making.
Yeah, El loves purses.
Mm. Then Agent Devereaux-- the FBI agent--
uh, the questions he had about Alicia,
working with her...
Uh, my rich friends.
Your rich friends, who are they-- donors?
I don't know.
There's your conflict. She has a client.
A client that could lead back to me?
Yes.
We need Elsbeth's client list.
How do we get that?
Do you have any water?
Yes, yes.
Yeah.
Thank you.
So how do we figure out
who the conflict of interest is?
We find Elsbeth's client list.
How do we get that?
I'd like to request the case file for my divorce.
Name, I.D.,
date action became final.
Michael B. Tascioni. July 28, 2012.
We don't allow dogs in this office.
Would you mind taking him outside?
Tom is a service animal.
He's an emotional support chihuahua.
Hold on a minute.
So, what does a case file from your divorce do?
Our property settlement agreement is still pending.
It values my law practice and Elsbeth's
and contains a list of all our clients.
Ah, smart.
Are you a cat person?
No. I'm a person person.
Why?
Read here, or I can reprint for ten cents a page.
Can you please...
I'll look at it.
I'll recognize anyone connected to Peter.
It's in the appendix. First page.
You've got to be kidding me.
What is it?
How can one client be redacted?
Oh, I got an order from a judge.
The judicial system takes the secrecy
of a grand jury witness seriously.
You should, too.
Tommy.
I waited around just to see you.
You knew I was coming?
I know you, dear.
And I know you.
I'm coming for you.
Tell me when.
I don't want to miss it.
Isn't she something?
Yes.
Fantastic.
What now?
Now...
We get smart.
I want you to talk with her.
And say what?
I want you to say something that will make her paranoid.
What's that?
What else?
Nothing else.
Diane Lockhart's not maneuvering to make this an all-female firm.
And Alicia?
A year ago, Diane suggested to Alicia that
this could be an all-female partnership.
But they didn't pursue it.
As far as you know.
Yeah, as far as I know.
Did Diane question you about our concerns?
Yes.
She did?
Yes. She saw me leaving your office yesterday.
What did you say?
I said my freelance work for you was confidential.
Okay, so she had a deal with Alicia a year ago
to make this an all-female firm--
why isn't she still coming after us?
You asked me to look for evidence if she was.
I did.
There is none.
Yeah, but she knew you were investigating,
so maybe she prevented you from finding that evidence.
I can't answer that.
Why not?
Because I deal in evidence.
I don't deal in states of mind.
You think we're being paranoid?
I haven't been here long enough to answer that conclusively.
Okay. Thanks.
Hey, this is Jason. Leave a message.
Mrs. Florrick.
We should talk.
Sure.
May I just say this?
I know Captain Hicks.
He's one of the most honest men I know.
He wouldn't leak.
Yet there was a leak.
Where? 'Cause I've been searching the Web
and there's no reference to what we're doing here.
This was an internal leak at the State Department.
What does that mean?
It means there was an interdepartmental squabble
and somebody leaked what we're doing here to another department.
Well, that wasn't Captain Hicks; he wouldn't do that.
Yeah.
That's why we need to talk to you.
To me-- Are you kidding?
No.
You think I leaked?
Well, I know that you and Captain Hicks
have been against this project as soon as you found out
that Massoud Tahan was an American citizen.
So you want to get rid of both of us.
Uh-oh. Alicia's in trouble.
Why? What'd she do?
They think she's the leak.
She's working for the Pentagon?
Alicia Florrick?
Yes, on an ad-hoc basis.
As a civilian consultant.
Shut up, J.
No, he's right.
So she's vetted?
By the Pentagon, but not us.
They didn't find out about our three-hop warrant.
Right.
And we were following her for a different reason.
You know, because of the... you know...
She was representing Dellinger.
You know, the worker who fled to Iceland.
So we overheard some confidential information from the Pentagon,
she was on her phone leaking to...
Uh, no.
She was just talking near her phone.
Not on her phone.
She wasn't on her phone?
Right. We used Dropoutjeep to turn her phone into a hot mic.
We can broadcast anything within 20 feet.
So what are you saying?
She wasn't the leak.
So who was?
We don't know.
Maybe nobody.
Shut up, J.
He may be right.
There's a chance this could be in-house.
We were listening in. The two of us.
Not to the confidential session, but outside.
What was that?
Sorry.
Alicia's having sex with the investigator.
Ah, great.
Here we go.
I think you might want to come inside.
We're reviewing Lance Hopper's statements.
So that was sent around internally here?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
And we think that was the leak. Not Alicia.
So who's in the loop around here?
Everybody at CMI level.
All right. All right, I'll see what I can do.
But hold off on listening further.
What do you mean? Why?
Because I asked you to.
Yeah, but we didn't do anything wrong.
Who said you did something wrong?
Just hold off until I get back to you.
You guys screwed up.
Shut up, J.
Shut up, J.
Is there a problem?
An enormous one.
The FBI is circling the governor.
You can't tell us why.
Even though you know.
So we're stuck chasing ghosts.
I need you to take Tom
until I can get my arms around this thing.
Of course.
I'm sorry I can't be more help,
but I have a client to protect here, too.
For what it's worth,
tell your client their phone's probably being tapped.
Meaning?
We just heard
the FBI tapped Peter's phones.
If they're listening to the governor,
they're listening to everyone.
You're trying to make me paranoid.
No.
Not you. Him.
Now that you've told me, I have to warn my client.
It's my fiduciary responsibility as his lawyer.
Even if it's a lie, I can't risk putting him in jeopardy.
But I can't call my client,
so I have to go to my client.
But if I go to my client,
you'll follow me.
Or you'll stake out this office.
We're just trying to help.
So that's a good move.
Now how do I move around it?
Or do I?
God, you're good at this.
Or do I avoid your tail?
That should be easy.
Okay, I'm heading out.
I'll-I'll join you.
Yeah?
So the dog has a GPS collar?
Indeed.
I bought it a week ago.
It's all part of the master plan.
Is the dot not moving part of the master plan?
Hm. The pergola. Garfield Park.
I love that spot.
That's where I proposed.
Elsbeth's sending a message,
leaving his collar there.
Guess it probably wasn't that hard,
on a dog his size.
It was a very big collar.
So wait, if the op is blown,
why do you two look so smug?
A: One should always looks smug.
And B:
It's exactly what we wanted Elsbeth to do.
She thinks she's shaken her tail.
Now she's let her guard down
and she won't notice her real tail.
You got her?
I got her.
I followed Elsbeth from Garfield Park
to a cafe on Randolph.
She hates that diner.
They have paella.
She had a bad experience with paella.
Ten minutes later,
this guy comes in and sits down with her.
Wait, wait that one.
Yeah.
His name is Lloyd Garber.
I followed him to his office on Michigan.
Turns out he owns the whole building.
He owns a lot more than that.
You know him?
Yeah, he's...
Dairy.
Dairy.
That's how she figured it out.
Garber owns a dairy farm in Israel.
He's the one who got me my job.
Elsbeth just connected the dots.
And that's the name she redacted from her client list?
Yeah, so that's not good.
They're coming after Peter
and one of his donors.
Yup.
Now it's time to go on the attack.
The Pentagon confirmed today that a U.S. Drone strike
killed Massoud Tahan, an ISIS operative
linked to the terror attack at a cartoon drawing contest
in Garland, Texas.
You're back from your secret mission.
Yup.
I heard things here are getting a bit crazy.
I thought bond court was a jungle, but wow.
Best thing to do-- stay on the sidelines.
We could just leave.
We could.
But money.
Money.
Do you know where Jason is?
Why?
Just curious.
The three of us against the world.
Hey. You're back.
Yup.
They didn't need me anymore.
And she can't tell us who they are.
Mm-hmm. It's top secret.
So, it's been fun here, huh?
Yeah, a gender war.
Jason, do you have a minute?
I do.
I'll leave you two.
Nice to have you back.
Good to be back.
You want me to close the door?
Yeah. Glass walls.
We have to get used to them.
So...
Things are complicated between us now.
What do you mean?
I remember high school.
I remember my phone calls being ignored.
I am not ignoring anything.
I just...
I don't like not knowing what the situation is.
What situation?
Look, it's not like you're married to the corner grocer.
All right? It's the governor.
And that's my problem.
No. My problem too.
He accepts it.
No, he doesn't.
He may say it, but no one accepts it.
Okay.
I accept it.
And...
You kept me from drinking.
If you don't come to me tonight, who knows?
Maybe I'll start drinking again.
Way to make me feel guilty.
You want things simple, I want things simple, too.
So here it is:
I want you again.
Don't you want it?
I want it.
Would you like me to tell you exactly...
Mr. Hopkins.
I need you to come with us.
Why? What's wrong?
We just need to ask you a few questions, that's all.
I was permitted to use the hot mic.
I know. Please come with us.
I didn't leak anything.
Good, then there shouldn't be any problem here.
I just sent the recording to the system admin. Stephen...
Hey, I'm just working here.
I need this job.
I got tagged for the hot mic.
It doesn't mean I leaked.
Good.
Then there shouldn't be a problem.
Shut up, J.
Hey, I just sent you something.
Take a look.
