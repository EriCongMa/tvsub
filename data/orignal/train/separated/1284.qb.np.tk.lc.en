sydney .
just one . i promise .
any more than that ,
and i won &apos;t sit next to you at the bar .
sure you will , as long as my card keeps the tab open .
go order me another sazerac .
i &apos;ll be back in a second .
okay .
thank you .
it &apos;s a very bad habit .
well , you &apos;re carrying around a lighter , so i think --
then i realize my fly is open --
has been for the last 46 minutes .
now , there &apos;s only four minutes left in the class .
what do i do ? do i zip it up ?
do i leave it alone ?
i mean , i &apos;m new .
is it better to be the guy who knew
or the guy who had no idea ?
and all these thoughts are swirling through my head ,
and i freeze .
i j-- go completely silent --
ticktock , ticktock --
for four minutes until the bell rings .
and -- and what ?
did they all file out with their eyes down ,
desperately avoiding eye contact ?
a couple students didn &apos;t look at me all semester .
uh , i &apos;m gonna go get us --
and , of course , i mean me -- refills .
okay .
he &apos;s great !
you think so ?
yes !
there &apos;s only one problem with tonight .
what ?
you !
he &apos;s awesome . i &apos;m awesome .
you -- way too stiff .
maura , relax , okay ?
the evening is going great .
oh , no , it isn &apos;t .
now i have all these water spots on my blouse .
great -- well , then , think about that
instead of wondering whether or not we &apos;re having a good time ,
because we &apos;re having a good time .
oh . what happened ?
oh , uh ... i have the dropsies .
do you want me to get you a towel ?
oh , no . no . it &apos;s fine .
but since we &apos;re telling funny stories , i --
really ? you &apos;re gonna tell an embarrassing story about yourself ?
okay , this -- this is a first .
no .
but remember the time we went to the adirondacks ?
don &apos;t you dare .
jane and i had never tried it , so we went camping .
she really doesn &apos;t like this story .
did you really like him ?
no .
what ? !
well , i answered &quot; yes &quot; the first 17 times you asked .
i &apos;m thinking it &apos;s the wrong answer .
well , i &apos;m just waiting for the other shoe to drop .
i &apos;m the other shoe ?
what do we got ?
well , i didn &apos;t mean you were a shoe .
sydney allen , out for a night with a friend .
came into the alley for a smoke .
two close @-@ contact gunshot wounds .
sexual assault , you think ?
well , i can &apos;t be sure till i do an exam ,
but clothing is intact .
and there doesn &apos;t seem to be any apparent signs
of her resisting an attack .
attempted robbery ?
victim &apos;s purse was 30 feet away .
no cash in it .
but could be she wasn &apos;t carrying any .
okay , i &apos;ll check with the patrols ,
see if there were any late @-@ night robberies in the vicinity .
well , she &apos;s married .
friend gave me his name .
judson , c.e.o. of a tech start @-@ up .
i pulled his phone number from the victim &apos;s phone .
the dress doesn &apos;t exactly scream &quot; homemaker . &quot;
no .
did you check to see if he called
when she didn &apos;t come home ?
yep .
did he ?
nope .
could mean nothing .
there were five 911 calls .
one of them was a report of a gunshot .
the others focus mainly on the victim .
nobody mentions a shooter .
we followed up with four of the callers
but didn &apos;t get any new information .
what about the fifth ?
burner phone .
we &apos;re tracking it , but no luck so far .
yeah , we struck out on the incident reports , as well .
interesting .
i called the husband right away ,
and when he didn &apos;t get back to me ,
i got a warrant for his credit cards .
turns out he checked in to the merrimac hotel last night .
the one downtown ?
yep .
well , maybe this isn &apos;t a robbery .
maybe this is just divorce the hard way
and he checked in to the hotel to give himself an alibi .
the most interesting of the textbooks is
&quot; police administration :
structures , processes , and behaviors . &quot;
720 pages of pure gold .
you had to memorize all that ?
no , but they reserve the right
to put anything from the book on the lieutenants exam .
i mean , structures and procedures , i get , but behaviors ?
i mean we &apos;re cops . we &apos;re pains in the asses .
you need 720 pages to dissect that ?
you &apos;re gonna do fine on the exam , by the way .
yeah , we &apos;ll see .
well , you &apos;re the best sergeant detective in the building .
they &apos;d be idiots not to promote you .
if i don &apos;t study a little more ,
they might be idiots if they do .
well , what &apos;s your textbook have to say about that ?
time of death was after sydney &apos;s , but not by much .
what about the weapon ?
can you determine if it was the same for both murders ?
you know i can &apos;t answer that question now , sergeant .
we know , but it never gets old asking .
how about the same @-@ caliber bullet ?
well , i &apos;ll take a leap into the void
and say that this bullet is the same caliber
as the one i removed from sydney allen .
let &apos;s assume that both victims were killed by the same person .
i &apos;m not willing to assume that .
okay .
let &apos;s say that korsak and i are willing to assume
that both victims were killed by the same person .
that narrows our list of suspects down
to people that needed them both dead .
interesting that the wife was killed first .
could be that the murderer knew judson was here
and wasn &apos;t going anywhere .
maybe . frankie &apos;s getting the security videotape .
maybe we &apos;ll get a look at him .
excuse me .
which one of you got the call about judson allen ?
that &apos;d be me .
hi . you &apos;re new .
frank ... ie rizzoli .
i &apos;m nin ... a holiday .
you temping ?
no . this is my new assignment .
you gonna need some time to settle in ?
nope .
allen co @-@ founded a company called inverta .
there &apos;s no public information ,
but i found a thread in a venture capital blog
about a boston @-@ based biogen company
getting a new eight @-@ figure investment .
turns out the v.c. mentioned flew into boston yesterday
and checked in to the merrimac hotel .
so , judson allen &apos;s about to hit the mother lode .
looks like it .
you &apos;re not from boston , are you ?
no -- chicago .
cubs or white sox ?
cubs .
no self @-@ respecting white sox fan would move to boston .
hey , uh , thanks for finding us a motive .
also , i got the hotel videotape .
this is the only person
who exits the elevator during your time frame .
he doesn &apos;t want to be seen , does he ?
no , but ...
i pulled his reflection from the glass
on the picture frame on the wall .
nice .
welcome to beantown , nina holiday .
ballistics confirm that sydney and her husband
were killed by the same gun .
and these striations indicate that a silencer was used .
professional hit .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying .
sorry . i &apos;m not putting that in your mouth .
i &apos;m saying it &apos; cause i get to say whatever the hell i want .
nobody asks me for scientific evidence to support it .
well , lucky you .
oh , you wouldn &apos;t do it even if the commonwealth said you could .
no , probably not .
the real question is ,
why did someone hire a hit man to kill them ?
oh . i &apos;m not expecting you to answer .
i &apos;m just thinking out loud . thanks , doc .
looks like a professional hit .
really ?
yeah , same gun , silencer ,
and it takes a lot of confidence
to kill somebody through a peephole .
well , our guy is coming into a lot of money .
maybe we start at the company he founded .
this is yours .
oh , what is it ?
toffee .
i made that up . it &apos;s wrapped . i don &apos;t know what it is .
you would .
grover verben , the dodgers &apos; lefty lion .
this is awesome !
who gave it to you ?
maura &apos;s new boyfriend .
must be quite a guy . bet that &apos;s an expensive gift .
you think he &apos;s trying to buy influence ?
is it gonna work ?
no . but , still , a cool gift .
detective korsak ? mr. harper &apos;s here .
i &apos;ll be right there .
and this is why
there are no vince korsak @-@ signed baseballs .
that and my .128 lifetime batting average .
really ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
really ?
i can &apos;t believe it . i just ...
i can &apos;t believe they &apos;re dead .
wish we &apos;d signed the financing papers
at the v.c. &apos; s yesterday .
that &apos;s a pretty callous response , mr. harper .
no .
i @-@ i just mean that
it would give our employees a chance
to find new jobs while they have a paycheck .
the company &apos;s gonna have to shut down ?
we &apos;ve got money in the bank to carry us a week or two ,
but ...
judson was the genius behind inverta .
without him , i won &apos;t be able to fund a garage sale .
so , who benefits if judson &apos;s dead ?
is there some other company that has a competing technology ?
the murders weren &apos;t random ?
we don &apos;t think so .
i can &apos;t think of anybody who &apos;d want to kill them .
why is that funny , mr. harper ?
well , i can &apos;t think of anybody who &apos;d want to kill judson ,
but ... if sydney were the only one dead ,
it &apos;d be easy to think
that judson was the one that killed her .
excuse me ?
he hated her .
judson grew up
in a terrible neighborhood outside philadelphia ,
scraped his way into an ivy league school .
he founded his first company before he graduated .
when he met sydney ,
he was impressed by her sophistication .
so what took the bloom off the rose ?
when inverta took off ,
it became clear she was just a gold digger .
she &apos;d found the shiniest fish in the pond
and attached herself to it .
so judson wanted a divorce .
he just didn &apos;t want to give her half his money .
something like that .
you called ?
hey , janie . you met nina ?
no . hi . jane rizzoli .
rizzoli ? like ...
yep . i &apos;m the reason the department has a nepotism policy .
no , you &apos;re the reason the department got rid of vending machines .
nice .
what do you got ?
a couple things .
first , we found three $ 10,000 withdrawals
from judson allen &apos;s personal account
made three weeks ago .
i thought the hit man killed judson over a payment dispute .
but if he paid him in advance ,
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
you said &quot; a couple things &quot; ?
we ordered the 911 calls
in case there was anything that wasn &apos;t in the transcripts .
on the face of it , nothing .
but ... go ahead . play it .
nina pulled down the level in the voices .
a woman just got shot behind the beacon club .
that &apos;s from the first call -- from the burner phone .
this is the second call .
send an ambulance ! my friend &apos;s been shot !
now , in the first call ,
you can &apos;t hear any background noises ,
but in the second call ,
you can hear sounds from the club .
which means that the person
who made the call from the burner phone
was in the alley
before someone came out and discovered the body .
a witness .
yeah .
so , judson hires a hit man to kill his wife .
the two of them aren &apos;t gonna rat on each other .
but once there &apos;s a witness who can identify the hit man ,
judson becomes a liability .
that &apos;s why judson &apos;s dead .
the killer is covering his tracks .
if the girl in that call isn &apos;t dead already ,
she will be if we don &apos;t get to her
before the hit man does .
purse was over here ?
yeah , about 30 feet from the victim .
well , maybe he dropped it
when he realized there was a witness .
he had a gun .
if she &apos;d been close , he &apos;d have shot her .
right . so , if she ran out of the alley ,
she just would have kept running .
we would have seen her on the street cameras .
so ... she never left the alley .
clear .
clear .
korsak , look at this .
this stuff isn &apos;t dusty .
it &apos;s homework .
from a high school .
we &apos;re looking for a kid .
well , what the hell is she doing down here ?
techs finished in the basement .
they didn &apos;t find any other bullets or any traces of blood ,
so , hopefully , our witness survived .
could be she got herself locked in the basement long enough
she was able to get away from him .
we &apos;re checking to see if any cameras picked her up
on the other side of the building .
nothing so far .
what about an i.d. ?
not yet .
the textbook is used throughout the boston public school system .
the good news is , only three schools
are offering the class for the summer session .
and we have calls in to all of them .
and i &apos;ve got a bot searching fbi wiretaps
looking for the names of local guys
who might have done the hit .
it &apos;s a long shot , but ...
well , i don &apos;t know what a bot is ,
but i appreciate the effort .
what do you think of her ?
who ? nina ?
yeah .
she seems all right -- helpful .
least likely to leave cheeto crumbs on the keyboard .
why ?
she &apos;s our new homicide hire .
what ?
yeah . i got wind of a chicago p.d. uniform
that was transferring in the department .
so , why isn &apos;t she on the streets ?
she wanted to make a change .
didn &apos;t think it &apos;d be received well back home .
there &apos;s got to be more to it than that .
probably , but what i cared about --
she has a perfect service record ,
a clean psych eval ,
and b.p.d. bought my argument that for now ,
we &apos;d be better off with a dedicated bric homicide analyst
than another detective .
what about frankie ?
same job . he just got a new employee .
you did this so it &apos;d be easy on me , didn &apos;t you ?
i did it because it &apos;s the best thing for the unit .
grover verben .
that kid &apos;s parents didn &apos;t do him any favors .
ma , that &apos;s not the point . it &apos;s a fantastic gift .
amazing .
why &apos;d you spill all over it ?
i didn &apos;t !
it hit the coffee cup , and that spilled ,
and then it rolled into --
so it &apos;s the ball &apos;s fault ?
please ?
please , can you get it out ? please ?
it won &apos;t be easy .
but you can do it . you can .
remember when i spilled motor oil on my communion dress ?
i mean , when you were finished with it , it looked like new .
all right , give me some time
and , uh , i &apos;ll work my magic .
thank you , because i checked online ,
and a replacement is 500 bucks .
i &apos;m sure it is .
look -- a little white vinegar gently rubbed around it .
i &apos;ll make it look like new .
but worse comes to worst ,
you tell maura that y @-@ you had an accident .
as a last resort . come on .
her new boyfriend gives me a fantastic gift ,
i don &apos;t want to tell her i ruined it .
all right . stop worrying . i &apos;ll fix it .
you can do it , ma . thank you .
thank you so much . thank you .
you can do it .
thank you , ma !
who &apos;s that ?
nina &apos;s bot found five guys who could have done the hit .
of those , one &apos;s dead , two are in jail ,
leaving these two handsome fellows
as our most likely local suspects .
judson &apos;s business partner said
he was from the rough side of philadelphia .
we should check to see if he contacted anyone back home .
girl named tasha williams
takes that physics class at monroe high school .
she didn &apos;t show up to class today .
no one called to say she &apos;d be absent .
can you get us directions to the high school ?
i &apos;ll send them to you in the car .
what is it ?
it &apos;s directions .
nina will send them to you while you &apos;re standing right there .
hi .
what are you doing home in the middle of the day ?
oh , i was working on a file in the bathtub last night ,
and i forgot to bring it back to the office .
is that relaxing ?
well , a bath releases stress responses ,
which is good for my hippocampus ,
that helps memory and learning ,
which helps me arrive at new solutions to problems .
and since not being able to figure things out
sparks a negative response
from my sympathetic nervous system ,
the bath works on all fronts .
i like a bath , too .
i catch up on my people magazines .
where did that come from ?
what ?
uh , that &apos;s my , uh , blober beiber , uh , n @-@ nurr ball .
grover verben .
it was jack &apos;s , and he gave it to jane .
yes . that was so nice of him .
what a lovely gift .
it &apos;s a family heirloom .
yeah , but what is it doing here ?
angela ?
maura ?
let it go .
stop !
stop it ! stop it !
&quot; grover ver &quot; ?
the &quot; ben &quot; is silent .
the &quot; ben &quot; is not silent . it &apos;s missing .
what happened to it ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe he got tired signing all those autographs .
all right , jane spilled coffee on it ,
and she asked me to get the stain out .
well , you did .
it &apos;s just too bad the stain was on the signature .
i know . i made it worse .
jane brought it to me
because she thinks i &apos;m some kind of whiz with the stain removal .
yeah , she did say once
that you got motor oil out of her communion dress .
yeah . kind of . i @-@ i bought her a new one .
so you kind of didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s mom logic .
don &apos;t worry .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
yeah , it will be to jane when she finds out .
she doesn &apos;t want to hurt jack &apos;s feelings .
she doesn &apos;t ? that &apos;s sweet .
no , and i think it &apos;s totally neurotic .
it &apos;s sweet .
so it doesn &apos;t matter that i erased half his name ?
it &apos;ll matter to jane .
i hate baseball .
tasha is a wonderful young woman .
it &apos;s remarkable how well she does here ,
given her circumstances .
which are what ?
i &apos;m almost certain she &apos;s homeless .
almost certain ?
she &apos;s guarded about anything personal .
clean but often wears the same outfit one day to the next ,
and there &apos;s no phone number on file .
those are giveaways .
any idea where we might find her ?
we have an address on file .
but i don &apos;t think she &apos;s there .
even her family is looking for her .
her family ?
an uncle was in this morning .
he said they hadn &apos;t seen her in a couple of days .
he came to school to make sure she was okay .
is this him ?
he didn &apos;t have a beard , the hair was lighter ,
but there &apos;s definitely a similarity .
he &apos;s shaved his beard . i &apos;ll update our bolo .
can you tell me about the uncle ?
he said the family was worried
and wanted to know if tasha had come to school .
i asked his name
to check if he was one of her responsible parties .
he wasn &apos;t , so i told him
i couldn &apos;t give him any information .
and then he left ?
not right away .
the phone rang ,
and there was nobody there when i picked it up .
okay .
can you call us if he comes back ?
thank you very much .
he got a look at her records .
he &apos;s got all her information --
an address , social security number .
how did he get here ?
she was doing homework in the basement .
maybe he saw a backpack , a textbook .
until we catch this guy , everything &apos;s by the book .
i want you to promise me
you &apos;ll follow b.p.d. protocols no matter what .
yeah , fine , fine .
maybe i &apos;ll make lieutenant
and you &apos;ll get to work with someone new --
who doesn &apos;t know you as well as i do .
i hope you do make lieutenant .
i &apos;m gonna put superglue on your big , fancy chair .
i wouldn &apos;t expect anything less .
uniforms went to the address tasha had on file with the school .
it was an abandoned building .
any evidence she was there ?
looks like maybe not for a while .
but the big news is this .
we tracked down her parents .
they &apos;re both dead .
dad -- five years ago of an aneurysm .
mom -- 18 months ago , cancer .
all right . well , then , why isn &apos;t she in foster care ?
social services think she &apos;s in the custody of her grandmother .
and i &apos;m sure all the information on her grandmother is bogus .
100,000 % .
extreme bogosity .
but let me get this straight .
teenager scams social services , and she &apos;s living on the street ,
taking care of herself for at least 18 months
while going to school ?
and maintaining a b @-@ plus average .
how does she survive ?
well , if her parents are dead ,
she &apos;s entitled to survivor benefits from social security .
give her enough money to live on -- at least the basics .
any chance the s.s.a. will give us
the address they &apos;ve been mailing the checks to ?
it &apos;ll take time .
well , she &apos;s got to cash them somewhere .
can you look up those check @-@ cashing places ?
look for one around the crime scene , her school ,
and that abandoned building she lived in .
we &apos;ll have to split up .
i don &apos;t like it -- not with a hit man out there .
yeah , but what other choice do we have ?
hold on -- this guy killed a woman ,
then he killed the guy that hired him to do it ,
and now he &apos;s trying to kill this girl
that witnessed the first murder .
vests -- everybody .
okay .
jane ?
it &apos;s in the car .
yeah , i recognize her . she hasn &apos;t been in this month .
but checks come in tuesday ,
so she &apos;ll probably be in wednesday .
any chance you could pull security video from the last month ?
maybe she came in with somebody .
i can &apos;t even go in the room with the recorder .
the manager yells at me .
i tend to spill .
i find it hard to believe
that a man like you could be bullied .
well , i wouldn &apos;t say &quot; bullying , &quot; really .
that &apos;s kind of a strong --
you know what i think ?
i think he &apos;s using his aggression to cover his fear .
he &apos;s the manager .
he feels threatened .
by ... ?
exactly .
he sees what i see
a man that challenges authority .
sometimes i &apos;m late , and i don &apos;t even call .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m talking about .
i think you &apos;re gonna have a chain of these places
and that manager &apos;s gonna work for you .
unless ...
forget it .
um ... thank you very much for your time .
no ! wait !
unless what ?
unless you decide what &apos;s right and what &apos;s wrong .
a girl &apos;s life is at stake here , and you can help her .
we &apos;ve got a terrible connection . where are you ?
grand street . i got a lead on tasha .
it &apos;s a partial address from her social security check .
well , that &apos;s a start .
let &apos;s meet at b.p.d. and --
listen , i &apos;m gonna --
i &apos;m gonna look around ... okay ?
i can &apos;t hear you , jane .
hello ?
korsak , i can &apos;t hear you , all right ?
so i &apos;ll call you if i find something definitive .
tasha ?
tasha , my name is detective jane rizzoli .
i &apos;m just here to help .
tasha , you here ?
wait ! no !
tasha , wait a minute . wait a minute . wait a minute .
open the door .
please .
you &apos;re in danger !
he &apos;s looking for you .
please .
i know what you saw !
please , honey !
i know what you saw . i know you &apos;re scared .
please .
come on .
if i can find you , he can find you .
okay ?
please open the door .
show me your badge .
i just want to protect you . that &apos;s all .
you all right ?
okay .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s my car right there . okay ?
i just want to take you to b.p.d. headquarters ,
and -- and we &apos;ll get you someplace safe .
all right ?
okay ?
come on .
get up , baby .
just hang on .
it &apos;s okay .
just hang on .
okay .
it &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s all right . we &apos;re safe .
we &apos;re between floors , okay ?
okay .
i &apos;m gonna sleep now .
no , no , no . tasha . no , no , no , no .
no . hey ! hey . you stay with me , okay ?
you stay awake . okay ?
okay .
um ... here .
listen to me , okay ? listen to me .
listen to me .
all right ? this is real important , okay ?
there , uh ...
there are three criminals , okay ?
and they were sentenced to exile in the desert .
okay ? - what are you -- what ?
it &apos;s a joke . it &apos;s a joke .
don &apos;t talk . you &apos;ll mess up my rhythm .
all right .
the first criminal says ...
all right .
&quot; i brought a loaf of bread , so if i get hungry ,
i have something to eat . &quot;
and the second criminal says , &quot; oh , yeah ?
&quot; well , i brought a canteen .
if i get thirsty , i got something to drink . &quot;
and the third criminal ,
he looks at these guys like they &apos;re idiots , you know ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s a lot smarter than they are .
he &apos;s real proud of himself , right ?
and he says , &quot; oh , yeah ? &quot; well , i brought a car door ,
so if i get hot , i can roll down a window . &quot;
that &apos;s terrible .
yeah .
you &apos;re sneaky .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry , baby . i knew that was gonna hurt .
you were shot , too .
yeah , but i was dressed for it .
i want you to keep pressure on that , okay ?
and i &apos;m gonna get some help .
oh , come on .
i can never get service in this building .
okay . okay .
okay . look .
i &apos;ve always wanted to use one of these things .
okay ?
no .
it &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s all right . okay ?
my team knows where we are , okay ?
they &apos;ll be here in no time .
it &apos;s all right , baby . hang on .
you find jane yet ?
nobody &apos;s heard from her . she &apos;s not picking up her phone .
i &apos;m triangulating pings from her last call ,
but it &apos;s still a six @-@ block radius on grand .
we should have something soon .
no , let &apos;s go now .
i want to be close by when she does call . come on .
come on !
i took auto shop when i was in high school .
i hot @-@ wired a volvo for my final .
no more jokes , please .
who &apos;s joking ? huh ?
connelly group .
this is detective jane rizzoli .
i &apos;m in an elevator in one of your buildings ,
and i need assistance , both police and ambulance .
copy that . first , i need your exact location .
you have my location . i &apos;m on a phone in one of your buildings .
check your screen .
connelly group manages 63 buildings in and around boston .
uh , it -- it &apos;s the one under construction .
we have eight under construction .
none of them are wired in .
