第七季 第六集
do you want me to sit here ?
no , here is fine .
you &apos;re kristen balko ?
yes .
and you &apos;re vp of information security at running milk ?
that &apos;s right .
um , is this part of the test ?
no , just the pre @-@ test .
think of this as a practice run .
we gather some background information ,
then go over the questions you &apos;ll be asked .
you &apos;re gonna tell me the questions on the test before the test ?
that &apos;s right .
isn &apos;t that cheating ?
uh , no , it isn &apos;t like the movies , ms. balko .
there are no &quot; gotcha moments &quot; &quot;
you &apos;ll know every question beforehand .
okay , got it .
fire away .
have you ever shared confidential materials
with individuals not employed with running milk ?
no , never .
am i supposed to answer ?
anything you want .
have you ever stolen anything from your workplace ?
never .
have you ever lied to the company ?
no .
i lied .
you did steal materials from the workplace ?
no , i lied by saying i never lied to the company .
could you be more specific ?
when i applied , in my resume ,
i told them that i worked as a vp of information technology
at a previous company .
but there was no vp of information technology .
oh , that &apos;s it ?
yes , what do you mean ?
they fired you because you said you were a vp
on your resume ?
no , they fired me because i lied in the lie detector test .
but that wasn &apos;t the point of the lie detector test , right ?
they were trying to find someone who stole confidential materials .
right .
and you didn &apos;t do that .
did you try to explain that to your boss ?
yes , but they said i lied to the company ,
so they could fire me .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m suing .
silicon valley &apos;s a very provincial town .
i can &apos;t get a job anywhere .
well , the polygraph protection act
keeps an employer from forcing you to take a lie detector test ,
but there are exceptions .
theft .
uh , kristen , this is our investigator jason .
hi . but i didn &apos;t steal anything .
yes , but it was the reason for the polygraph .
they caught you in another lie , but ...
they need corroborating evidence .
right .
and they couldn &apos;t have fired her
unless they already had some evidence that she lied on her resume ?
did they , kristen ?
have evidence i lied ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
the whole point of the polygraph was about this theft .
okay , um , why don &apos;t you give us the day to think about it ?
actually , i don &apos;t have a day .
mr. canning told me you &apos;d be able to move faster than he could .
louis canning ?
yes .
he already filed the suit ,
but he got busy with another case ,
and he thought you &apos;d be good to take it over .
i &apos;m sure he did .
all right , i will see if they have any corroborating evidence .
good , a polygraph can &apos;t be the sole basis for firing .
so what-- cap my work off at five hours ?
yeah .
okay .
so , what did you find out about insurance ?
oh , yeah . malpractice insurance is a fortune ,
but we could bundle it .
i can get a rider to your homeowner &apos;s policy ,
and just split the increase in your premium ?
will the coverage extend to jason ?
no , he &apos;s a freelancer .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a problem .
did you know he used to be a lawyer ?
no .
he practiced in new jersey .
he was disbarred for a criminal conviction .
he punched a judge .
he punched a judge ?
yep .
why ?
i guess he didn &apos;t like his decision .
and you &apos;re worried about the insurance ?
yeah , if jason beats up someone on the job ...
yeah , well , due diligence .
we should find out what happened .
okay , i &apos;m gonna call new jersey .
see if i can talk to the judge .
what &apos;s up , eli ?
what &apos;s the best thing about peter ?
excuse me ?
i need a quote from you for peter &apos;s bio .
do you need it to be true ?
true adjacent .
peter &apos;s motto is &quot; service above self .
&quot; my family has benefitted from it , now america can . &quot;
eli , that &apos;s ...
i know , it &apos;s nauseating . help me out .
eli ?
over here .
just a second , alicia .
i thought this was a staff meeting .
it is .
turn off your cell phone
and i &apos;ll turn off mine .
what is it ?
an alabama slammer .
yeah . i like them strong .
confusion to our enemies .
so , what are we discussing , ruth ?
what makes eli gold tick ?
uh , i know how this works , ruth .
unless you &apos;re trying to seduce me , which i very much doubt ,
you get me drunk , you pretend to be drunk
and you find out more about me
than i find out about you .
oh , eli , you &apos;re too suspicious .
you &apos;re a new tree in my forest .
i want to know more about that tree , that &apos;s all .
because unless i chop it down ,
that tree &apos;s now part of my life.so ...
my grandfather , samuel gold ,
was a teamster organizer in brooklyn .
everything i learned , i learned from him .
i remember going to visit him in his office when i was little .
all the people coming to kiss his ring .
looking for advice , for help .
and he told me
that the most powerful men are the ones that no one knows exist .
is something funny ?
oh , yeah . what ?
none of that was true .
your grandfather was ira goldstein ,
owner of a schmatta business in queens .
he died a pauper after his brother @-@ in @-@ law cheated him
out of a uniform consignment with the nypd .
and that quote ?
you changed it .
it &apos;s from the usual suspects .
so , what do you want , ruth ?
why are you pretending to care about me ?
we got new internals from this afternoon .
peter made another four point bump .
that &apos;s more than a fluke , that &apos;s a trend .
we broke through . we have a shot .
and not just at the vice presidency .
we could win .
things turn sour for hillary--
the e @-@ mails , the next thing they throw at her-- we win .
but we need to be rowing in the same direction .
this goes the way we all want ,
they &apos;ll be enough to carve up for both of us .
you see that , right ?
i do .
so the strategy &apos;s changed .
we &apos;re not being kind and deferential to the frontrunner .
we &apos;re acting like the frontrunner .
we &apos;re not aiming for the vice presidency .
we &apos;re aiming for the presidency .
so , what do you need from me ?
we &apos;re moving up the announcement to thursday .
we want to take advantage of the momentum .
you need alicia ?
yes , much more than we originally agreed .
voters need to see these two together .
young , vibrant , looking toward the future .
jackie o to his jfk .
we need to work together , eli .
you need to trust me .
and i need to trust you .
who &apos;s that ?
i don &apos;t know . silicon valley lawyer ?
hello . alice florrick , yes ?
yes .
andrea stevens .
it &apos;s so nice to meet you .
i was told you were the opposing counsel .
it just makes it so much more exciting
when you respect the opposition , don &apos;t you think ?
it does .
hello .
hi . lucca quinn .
hi . i love your hair .
how many years are you out of law school , lucca ?
a few .
well , that &apos;s better than less than a few .
all rise .
oh , here we go .
court is now in session .
lucca , if you ever want any advice .
good afternoon .
i &apos;ve read your preliminary motions .
i would like to take up the , uh , jurisdictional question .
your honor , the plaintiff lives in chicago ...
your honor , the question isn &apos;t about whether she lives in chicago .
your honor , i was warned about chicago courtrooms ,
but i didn &apos;t think it was gonna be about who shouted the loudest .
it isn &apos;t , counselor .
what do you have ?
thank you , your honor .
this is rank forum shopping .
mrs. florrick knows this case belongs in california .
running milk has no chicago offices .
and the lie detector test in question
took place in california .
kristen balko lives in chicago .
and thanks to the cloud tax
passed by the chicago city council ,
running milk &apos;s offices are both in california and illinois .
yes , but respectfully , your honor ,
they are not physically in illinois .
but as running milk and its ilk have constantly reminded us :
&quot; brick and mortar are things of the past .
the cloud is the future . &quot;
your honor , so many of our witnesses will have to be
flown in from san jose and that doesn &apos;t ...
and so many of our witnesses will have to be flown in from chicago ...
your honor , to refute these ...
thank you .
but as ms. stevens pointed out ,
this shouldn &apos;t be about who shouts the loudest .
motion is denied .
we &apos;ll hear the case here .
please have the running milk software spec
sent to me by end of day ,
thank you .
just the first skirmish .
在法庭外用拳头猛击法官
peter wants to be president .
excuse me ?
peter thinks he can be president .
i need a drink .
do you want one ?
no , i need to go .
they moved the announcement up to thursday .
you need to be in springfield .
i wrote you a speech ; very michelle obama .
what time thursday ?
3 : 00 p.m.
they &apos;ll need us more than usual .
they keep mixing their metaphors .
you &apos;re either michelle obama or jackie o.
do you ever wonder why i &apos;m hearing this from you
and not peter ?
what ? no .
what do you mean ?
well , i &apos;m hearing that peter truly is running for president
and that i might be first lady from his campaign manager .
i am not his campaign manager .
you think he has a chance ?
i don &apos;t know .
i thought trump would self @-@ destruct ,
so what do i know ?
primaries are their own insanity .
what are you making ?
a margarita .
tequila , triple sec .
you judging me ?
no .
that sounded like a judgmental huh .
no .
you get as sloppy drunk as you want to .
so , what do they want me to do ?
be involved . go on thursday .
give a good speech . look first lady @-@ like .
i got frank landau to introduce you .
it &apos;s not bad having the head of the democratic committee
say nice things about you .
what are you doing , eli ?
this doesn &apos;t sound like you .
sure it does .
this is what i sound like .
no , no , no , no .
you &apos;re scheming something here .
cheers .
hey , i &apos;ve got some good news and i got some bad news--
which do you want first ?
bad .
good .
running milk &apos;s hr team
definitely verified kristen lied on her resume ?
damn .
so we have no case .
what &apos;s the good news ?
i don &apos;t think there was a theft at running milk .
what do you mean ?
a firm like running milk is required to notify
their customers of any breach ; they didn &apos;t .
california attorney general &apos;s got
no record of any breach at running milk .
so they had no reason to polygraph .
非法程序 &#91; 毒树 &#93; 获得的证据 &#91; 果 &#93; 不得采纳
right , fruit of the poisonous tree .
why &apos;d you punch that judge ?
i was angry .
why were you angry ?
don &apos;t you get angry ?
i do , but i don &apos;t punch people .
maybe you should start .
as you can see , your honor ,
running milk never suffered a security breach ,
and since that was the only legal justification
for polygraphing our client ,
that polygraph must be thrown out .
is this true ?
can you give me one second , your honor ?
as you requested ,
uh , the ceo of running milk
flew in a great personal expense .
i &apos;m honored .
without admitting to any wrongdoing , your honor ,
running milk generously agrees to
rehire the plaintiff at her original salary .
we just want this to be over .
really ? since when ?
since an hour ago .
we ask that this suit be dismissed , your honor .
your honor , if our client is rehired ,
she can &apos;t be subjected to a new polygraph , is that correct ?
yes , private employers are barred
from making polygraphs a condition of employment .
may we have a ruling on that , your honor ?
um , can ... i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry , can i just have one more second , your honor ?
actually , polygraphs may be applied
to employees engaged in counterintelligence
or national security functions ,
pursuant to a contract with the federal government .
your honor , our client has no connection with national security .
and again i ask for a ruling .
these contracts show
that running milk has ongoing accounts with the government .
this makes no sense .
if these contracts were the reason for these polygraph tests ,
then why create the fiction of a security breach ?
are we really wondering why the national security agency
might have a need for secrecy ?
your honor , the defendant just plans
to rehire our client so they can fire her again .
yes , but legally .
these contracts appear in order .
before miss balko starts work again ,
she &apos;ll need to submit to a polygraph .
your honor .
i don &apos;t have time for this , eli .
even for a friend ?
if you &apos;re wearing a wire ,
you have to tell me , or it &apos;ll be thrown out in court .
i am not wearing a wire .
i need your help .
i would never have taken that bribe .
i didn &apos;t need you to warn me .
but i did warn you .
what ? what do you need ?
information on frank landau
and his manipulation of voting machines in the last election .
no , i won &apos;t betray him .
he won &apos;t know it &apos;s you .
i just need the proof from you , and i &apos;ll do the rest .
what are you up to ?
please hold .
lockhart , agos &amp; lee .
lockhart , agos &amp; lee .
please hold .
monica timmons ?
you won &apos;t mind working at a big law firm ?
no , i think i &apos;d like the challenge .
where are you from originally ?
maryland .
oh , maryland .
baltimore ?
yes .
tough neighborhood .
no .
loyola .
we don &apos;t see many applicants
from that law school .
i think it &apos;s underrated , actually .
professor edmund kindle , who clerked for justice kennedy ...
never heard of him .
he &apos;s a fantastic scholar .
he was my mentor .
how nice .
thanks for coming in .
we don &apos;t get to see many black lawyers in here .
how old are you , honey ?
twenty @-@ six .
what , are you , uh , nigerian , or what ?
what .
hey , you &apos;re a sassy one , aren &apos;t you ?
i try to be .
let me ask you a question
that i ask all the summer interns .
if you were on a desert island ...
i &apos;m glad you came in today , monica .
i &apos;m glad i did , too .
we need fighters in here .
so you &apos;re from maryland ?
yes .
baltimore ?
that &apos;s right .
you have to be tough to grow up there ?
monica timmons , i like her .
no , easy pass .
i know she didn &apos;t go to a top @-@ tier law school .
top tier ? loyola barely made it to second tier .
i like monica , too ,
but i do worry about her lsats .
i thought you wanted new talent , cary .
yeah , and we have it
in brian , john michael and , um ...
the other one .
you mean the three that looked like you ?
that has nothing to do with it .
we need some diversity .
these three are the top at this firm ,
every young face
of their classes .
looks like every other one .
excuse me .
uh , i &apos;m for the black girl .
i &apos;m gonna regret this ,
but is there a reason you want to hire a candidate
significantly less qualified than the others ?
she &apos;s black , she &apos;s suffered , like my people .
we don &apos;t hire on the basis of race , howard .
thought we were on the same side .
you are on the same side .
you &apos;re both for dipping .
we are not in for dipping .
this isn &apos;t about dipping .
yes ... that &apos;s the truth .
you want to dip our standards .
your honor , as much as i appreciate the opposition &apos;s passion ,
you have already validated our governmental contracts ,
so i &apos;m not sure why ...
yes , but the mere existence
of those contracts does not mean
that our client was engaged in such work .
i &apos;m not sure i understand .
can you name which of her projects falls
但不禁止使用测谎仪
under the eppa exception ?
your honor , uh ...
i am stunned at the cynicism on display here .
mrs. florrick knows
my client &apos;s contracts preclude me from going into detail .
no one here has security clearance to hear the details .
so we just have to trust you .
no , you have to trust the united states government .
running milk has already misled this court .
yes , but this isn &apos;t about running milk anymore .
this is about national security .
so the polygraph will proceed .
hey , you did your best .
i want our announcement to echo obama &apos;s in every way .
we &apos;ve got the steps of the old state capitol building ,
same as obama .
gene , i want the same overcoat for peter .
i mean the exact same one that obama wore--
and alicia , too .
the whole point , people , is to get the press
to put the two photos side @-@ by @-@ side .
obama and peter .
sorry to interrupt .
thank you for your enthusiasm .
let &apos;s not jinx those polls .
okay , so , um , this race is in flux ,
and i can tell you that because i feel it
out there on the trail , and it &apos;s because
of all the hard work we &apos;ve been doing ,
but now we have to double down .
i want every voter in this country to see
who i am , where i &apos;m from ,
and why i &apos;m doing this .
thank you again .
no luck with leahy or durbin ?
uh , they &apos;re endorsing hillary .
we could go with a state senator .
well , that makes it too much of an illinois affair .
there is one idea we could try .
eli , could you step in here a minute ?
mr. governor .
well , i &apos;m glad to see
that you two are working so well together .
oh , we had our datente drink .
um , eli wanted frank landau to introduce alicia .
it &apos;s a good idea-- he &apos;s well respected in democratic circles ,
and eli wrote him an excellent speech .
sounds good .
but i &apos;m wondering if landau would be better
to introduce you , mr. governor .
if you &apos;d be all right with that .
of course , i &apos;m here to serve .
i &apos;ve seen landau speak .
he gives a true barnburner .
she stole landau from you .
how is it you can lurk
in an office the size of a phone booth ?
ruth stole landau from you
and yet you seem happy , eli .
what &apos;s that about ?
i &apos;m a good person .
no .
you &apos;re setting peter up .
i want to be left alone with my thoughts .
i thought you wanted to destroy ruth , not peter .
sometimes to stop the cancer ,
you have to endanger the patient .
oh , my god .
you &apos;re like an evil scientist .
what are you endangering peter with ?
landau rigged the voting machines in the last election .
he &apos;ll have his arm around peter
at the biggest moment of his career .
that &apos;ll leave a mark .
hello ?
judge hess .
alicia florrick .
thank you taking the time to speak with me .
certainly . you said you had some questions
about jason crouse ?
i do . i &apos;m conducting background checks on private investigators .
yes , i &apos;d heard he moved to chicago .
i was wondering if you could shed some light
on the incident that got him disbarred .
are you thinking of hiring him , ma &apos;am ?
we are .
well , then i have a few words of advice .
do you have a pen ?
i do .
no , no , no , no , no .
and no .
he &apos;s a ticking time bomb .
he will smile , he will tell you jokes ,
and you &apos;ll even think you &apos;re dealing with a normal person ,
then he &apos;ll explode when you least expect it .
um , that was several years ago .
yes .
have you read the book the sociopath next door ?
i haven &apos;t .
one out of every 25 people are sociopaths .
they don &apos;t have the gene that leads to compassion .
they can fake being a normal person ,
but deep down , they aren &apos;t .
they may not murder , they may not rape ,
but they will eat away your life from the inside .
that is jason crouse .
and my advice to you , ma &apos;am , is run .
but did you participate in go pro ?
yes , everyone did .
and did you have a passion project ?
kristen and her coworkers were encouraged
to have side projects ,
and there &apos;s a chance that one of these side projects
was the reason she got fired .
well , i was working on a relationship @-@ mapping app .
sorry , what ... what is that ?
it &apos;s a way to create diagrams of relationships
between concepts , ideas , people and other pieces of information .
i found a way to cross @-@ platform on javascript
for an app i called spoiler .
what &apos;s spoiler ?
it analyzes the pilot episode of a new tv series
and predicts stuff about the story ,
like who will sleep with who and who will get killed off .
so it &apos;s predictive .
yes . why ?
did anyone say it might be used by the nsa ?
no , it &apos;s a stupid little program .
it &apos;s not for surveillance .
where are you going ?
to talk to someone .
what &apos;s so secret you couldn &apos;t talk on the phone ?
i need to get in touch with an old client of ours .
i think he gave you information on how to contact him ?
it &apos;s complicated .
what isn &apos;t ?
all right .
hello ?
um , i &apos;m a friend of cary &apos;s .
you said to call if there was anything we needed .
where are you ?
chicago .
all right , did you do everything ?
everything cary said .
can i come out from under the blanket now ?
did you type the number in under the blanket ?
yes .
then yes .
uh , what do you need ?
i need your help .
when you say potential , diane , what you &apos;re really talking ....
just ask me what i &apos;m talking about .
you &apos;re talking about the future of this firm .
yes , and monica is the kind of attorney
i see in our future .
new @-@ law .
that is where our future lies ,
in companies like three @-@ tech .
the 3 @-@ d printing company ?
their billable hours are laughable .
so were chumhum &apos;s , when they first started out .
we need people like brian and john michael and ray .
and i think we should vote .
i vote for the black girl .
well , you don &apos;t get a vote , howard .
you &apos;re not a name partner .
i &apos;m on the hiring committee .
you volunteered for the hiring committee
when you were thinking about suing .
ah , ridiculous .
okay ... cary .
i will vote for the guy
who interned at silicon systems ...
brian . right .
and , david , i will agree
to the automaton
with the perfect lsats ...
billy bob .
that &apos;s not his name .
the two @-@ named guy .
... if you will both agree
to support monica .
i &apos;m sorry , diane .
i just can &apos;t .
then what will work for you , david ?
hiring the three
most highly qualified candidates .
three white guys .
two from harvard , one from stanford .
yup .
do you agree ?
i liked monica , diane .
i really did , but ...
she doesn &apos;t look like you , right ?
that &apos;s not fair .
a lot of things that aren &apos;t fair are true .
your honor , at some point your ruling must be honored .
this is not about your ruling ...
they want to play a video
without telling us from whom .
this is a matter of some delicacy--
and national security--
and we believe , for the safety of the person on the video ,
advance notice places him at unnecessary
and unacceptable risk .
who is it ?
your honor , i &apos;m being genuine , here .
i don &apos;t want to imperil the man
who was brave enough to ...
give me a name .
jeff dellinger .
they want to hear testimony
from a disgraced , poor man &apos;s snowden ?
and i want to hear it .
we &apos;ll view it in chambers
and then i &apos;ll decide whether to admit it into evidence .
spoiler has been one of the nsa &apos;s
most exciting civilian acquisitions ,
and although it was created for rather banal reasons ,
the same infrastructure
lends itself well to processing other forms of data .
like understanding conversations between potential terrorists
and predicting their future plots .
you know , like if , uh , one terrorist is going to get into
a love triangle with another terrorist &apos;s wife .
just kidding .
sort of .
the nsa has spent millions of dollars
to secure the spoiler app .
and , in my experience ,
the agency and their partners
will do a ... a lot
to protect that kind of investment .
your honor ,
running milk continues to mislead this court .
they sold an app to the government--
an app my client created--
then terminated her
to prevent her stock options from vesting ,
so she wouldn &apos;t share in the profit of her own invention .
this testimony proves nothing .
they &apos;re asking the court to take the word of a man
disciplined by the nsa
before fleeing to a non @-@ extradition country .
mr. dellinger has a vendetta against the nsa .
that &apos;s all this proves .
can we get mr. dellinger in here ?
given the nsa &apos;s reach ,
i couldn &apos;t ask him to put himself at that risk .
i understand . and i sympathize .
but if there isn &apos;t any insoluble ,
physical reason that mr. dellinger can &apos;t testify in person ,
well , i have to agree with ms. , uh ...
stevens .
i &apos;m sorry , but i don &apos;t see you getting out of that polygraph .
good luck .
what ?
are you kidding me ? eli !
we lost the old state capitol building .
what ? how ?
there &apos;s an inter @-@ faith
break dancing competition on the steps .
are you kidding me ?
we need the parallel to obama .
we need the ...
well , it &apos;s not just any steps .
it &apos;s the town hall steps !
the advance team .
they &apos;re suggesting the steps to the local gym .
the local ...
they say they look the same .
it doesn &apos;t matter if they look the same .
it &apos;s a gym !
did lincoln exercise there ?
did he talk about a house divided while on the treadmill ?
then why are we there ?
not bad .
are those crosses ?
no , decorative &quot; x &quot; s.
oh , with a decorative jesus ?
why are there crosses ?
it &apos;s a catholic gym .
a catholic gym ? is that a thing ?
a gym at a catholic school .
you swear you can get the steps ?
okay , then tie them down .
and see if you can get the break dancers to move .
you &apos;re not screwing with me , are you , eli ?
this hurts both of us .
okay , we cover up the crosses with a banner .
have people on the steps .
he comes up through the crowd .
it could look like the obama announcement .
i found what you were looking for .
what are you doing here ?
better than you coming to my office .
don , if you are recording me , and i ask ,
you have to acknowledge it
or the recording cannot be used in a court of law .
are you recording me ?
no , eli .
here &apos;s your proof .
the man who arranged the hack
of the voting machines last march ,
he &apos;s an old stooge of frank landau &apos;s .
and he &apos;ll talk ?
he &apos;ll talk to a reporter
if they protect him under the shield laws .
okay , i need him on thursday .
landau will introduce the governor .
then i need this report to come out .
he &apos;ll pin it on landau ?
definitely .
landau and peter .
excuse me ?
he &apos;ll pin it on landau and peter .
peter florrick ?
yes .
what &apos;s wrong ?
but peter had nothing to do with the hack .
yes , he did .
he was worried about his wife losing ,
so he set it up .
what &apos;s wrong ?
this is good , eli .
you wanted to hobble the governor , right ?
well , this will knock him out .
right .
so thursday , right ?
you want him to drop the bomb
just after landau intros peter ?
forget everything that you &apos;ve ever
heard or seen on television .
attempts to manipulate the data output are futile .
so what do i do ?
manipulate the person reading the data .
any deviation from your baseline stress level ,
doesn &apos;t make the needle go all crazy .
it &apos;s the polygrapher &apos;s job to figure out what they mean .
so , while the machine may be objective ,
the polygrapher &apos;s not .
he &apos;s the key .
so what do you want me to do , flirt with him ?
i want you to throw him off his game .
start by asking a bunch of questions .
and then what ?
confess before the test starts .
about my resume ?
no , about everything else .
every mistake you &apos;ve ever made ,
every lie you &apos;ve ever told .
convince him that
you are unburdening yourself , being truthful .
it &apos;ll make him want to give you the benefit of the doubt .
and , remember , doubt is your friend .
you don &apos;t have to come up as truthful .
inconclusive works for you here .
all right . are you ready ?
this is ... i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m so honored you &apos;d bring me back
for a second interview .
monica , actually ,
i &apos;m afraid this isn &apos;t a second interview .
uh , the firm won &apos;t be able to extend you an offer .
what ?
associate hiring is extremely competitive , as you know .
we &apos;ve seen dozens of eminently qualified candidates and , uh ...
well , i &apos;m afraid you came up short .
we &apos;re happy to have you .
most firms would have sent a form letter .
why drag me in here ?
because i ...
i want you to know
i think you &apos;re a stellar young woman ,
one with a very promising future .
and if i can be of any help , please call .
you brought me in here
to say you want to help me ...
but not to give me a job ?
okay . thanks .
this was most illuminating .
what is this place ?
it &apos;s a neutral , third @-@ party location .
they said the polygrapher would meet us here .
hello . i &apos;ll be administering your test today .
i &apos;ll be asking you questions ,
then observing you for truthfulness .
is this a joke ?
i analyze 50 different measurements in real time ,
including basal body temperature ,
retinal movement , and vocal stress .
i &apos;m multiple input lie detection .
mild , for short .
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s mr. gutierrez .
did things work out for your client ?
actually , no .
they &apos;ve gotten worse , mr. gutierrez .
wait . is it my fault ?
no . my client submitted for another polygraph ,
but it turned out to be one of those new high @-@ tech machines .
mild ?
you &apos;re familiar with it .
yeah , those homeland security pinheads
always think systems like that are cutting @-@ edge .
avatar , sberbank .
you wouldn &apos;t happen to know any way we could ...
beat it ?
uh , sorry , no .
but i mean , it can &apos;t be too difficult .
it &apos;s a bucket of bolts .
we &apos;d love to get some insight .
uh , let me see what i can pull together .
welcome back , mrs. florrick .
the water &apos;s fine .
actually , mom , that was my witness .
what , why ? grace , what &apos;s going on ?
she sounds stressed .
that was not stress .
why is she at home ?
it &apos;s middle of a workday .
maybe her firm tanked .
that &apos;s distressing .
if she were stressed ,
it would be because she is not over
what &apos;s @-@ his @-@ face being shot .
do you think we can get authorization ?
to keep up the three @-@ hop ?
yeah .
maybe if we use this data .
i just sent you a file .
goats ? no more goats !
wait for it , wait for it .
how long ?
23 seconds .
fainting goats .
my god , it &apos;s like day school .
let &apos;s go , everyone , status meeting .
uh @-@ oh , firings .
what do you mean ?
the changes in the patriot act .
they take place at the end of the month--
they &apos;re not gonna need all of us anymore .
are you kidding me ? !
i just moved into a new apartment .
maybe it &apos;ll be the guys in software .
they &apos;re always screwing off .
i know you &apos;re all anxious to hear
about the changes around here .
as you probably all know
we can no longer collect bulk telephone data .
i know , it &apos;s a bit of a shift .
but we &apos;re taking this as good news .
okay , here we go-- their good news is our bad .
fisa will still grant us three @-@ hop targeting
of our most important cases ,
so none of you are going to lose your jobs .
excuse me ?
yes , you heard me .
the reforms in the patriot act will force us
to be more focused , that &apos;s all .
all of our tools are still in place .
of course , it will mean more paperwork .
seriously , i just saved your jobs ,
and now you &apos;re complaining about paperwork .
uh , mr. foyle ?
we &apos;ve been tracking dellinger ,
and he called alicia florrick .
what was the subject ?
no threat , just talk of a case .
her husband &apos;s running for president .
yes , but we &apos;ve been tracking everyone else that dellinger called .
okay , do this .
you can track her for 48 hours .
find me a connection between mrs. florrick
and another brown @-@ level target
and i get you a green light .
brown level , seriously ?
take yes for an answer .
thank you , sir .
don &apos;t see many black lawyers in here .
how old are you , honey ?
洛 &amp; 艾 &amp; 李律所隐藏摄像头拍摄
what are you-- uh , nigerian or what ?
thanks for coming in , but i think i should warn you
that we have a sort of lockhart / agos / lee type here
and you &apos;re not really it .
we &apos;ve had some african @-@ americans here before
not in all positions
but we are open to all types and all backgrounds .
no , no , you &apos;re exactly the kind of diversity we want
at lockhart / agos / lee .
we &apos;ve seen dozens of eminently qualified candidates ,
and , um , well ...
you just came up short .
又录取了3名白人男性律师
cary !
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s lucca .
i got some good news on jason .
really ?
yeah , i spoke to a guy that witnessed the fight with the judge .
uh , what &apos;d he say ?
he said there was some pushing and some shoving ,
some raised voices ,
but he said the judge walked out of callahan ,
this bar near the courthouse ,
without a scrape on him .
judge hess drew a very different picture .
you spoke with the judge ?
yes .
he made it sound like
jason beat him within an inch of his life .
that &apos;s probably kristen .
i have to get down to springfield .
how close are you ?
i &apos;ll be less than five .
okay .
what ?
we can &apos;t be on the steps .
the fire department says they need reinforcement ,
and we don &apos;t have it .
let me get this straight .
we couldn &apos;t announce on the springfield steps ,
because they &apos;re having a square dancing contest .
break dancing competition .
interfaith break dancing competition .
so we move to the steps of a gym because they look similar .
but now the fire department says we can &apos;t announce there ,
because they &apos;ll collapse ? !
or lean aggressively .
so , where does that leave us ?
inside of the gym ?
yes .
did lincoln do anything here ?
no , sir .
did obama do anything here ?
not to our knowledge , sir .
would you mind putting this on , sir ?
why ?
it matches obama &apos;s .
yes , because he announced
outside in 12 @-@ degree weather .
i &apos;m announcing in an 89 @-@ degree gym .
yes , but it won &apos;t look that way on tv .
no , but i &apos;ll be sweating like a hog .
we &apos;ll put some fans up there to cool you down .
and here &apos;s your scarf .
oh , mr. landau , hello .
ruth .
frank .
so glad you could do this for us .
well , i &apos;m honored to be a part of it .
just sorry we couldn &apos;t get the obama location
in the old capitol building .
as am i.
but , uh , here we have the common touch .
yes , and the common smell .
i think that &apos;s gym socks .
in a few hours , peter florrick is expected
to take the stage here in springfield
伊利诺伊州 斯普林菲尔德
to announce his candidacy for president .
so , are you gonna destroy him ?
why don &apos;t you close the door ?
so ...
are you going to destroy him , krishna ?
if i destroy peter , i destroy her .
ruth ?
no , alicia .
she doesn &apos;t know peter had her voting machines hacked .
but he did it for her .
yeah , but then he hung her out to dry .
then what &apos;s your plan ?
... jobs and most importantly national security ...
i have no idea .
you &apos;re absolutely right .
all that and more coming up next .
i commend your ingenuity and your chutzpah .
maybe if i &apos;d put that in the special skills section
of my resume ? i &apos;d have a job .
monica , i &apos;m not saying our world today is enlightened .
far from it .
but starting out as a woman in a big law firm 30 years ago ,
let &apos;s just say i empathize .
everyone has to eat dirt on the way up .
the only difference is the kind ...
are you seriously comparing histories ?
yes , i am .
if you chose to lay on your back
for a male partner or two ,
just to get ahead , that was your choice .
excuse me ?
i don &apos;t choose to have women hold their purses tighter ,
when they see me coming down the street .
i don &apos;t choose for cops to drag me out of my car and frisk me
just for failing to signal .
i &apos;m not trying to equate ...
yes , you are .
and there is no comparison .
i don &apos;t want your understanding .
i don &apos;t need your advice .
what i need is a job .
it was from springfield
that abraham lincoln announced his candidacy for president .
it was from springfield that barack obama
announced his candidacy for president .
and it is from springfield where our next great president
will hail as well !
he understands the challenges ...
oh , my god , i &apos;m burning up .
i &apos;m like a wet seal with sweat .
hold on .
oh , that &apos;s so sweet .
yeah , you can &apos;t buy moments like that .
why are you so cynical ?
and you may remember this photo
of the president and first lady on the day of his announcement .
it &apos;s fun .
what ?
ladies and gentlemen ,
peter florrick !
well done , frank .
go on .
thank you , frank !
well , i &apos;m gonna make this brief .
today i &apos;m announcing my candidacy
for the democratic nomination
for the president of the united states of america !
how &apos;s that for plain speaking ?
well , let me just tell you i couldn &apos;t do it
without this woman by my side .
alicia !
oh , cool air .
thank you .
i think you all know my wonderful wife .
with you all the way !
hello ?
oh , mrs. florrick , how are you ?
you must be in springfield .
yes , sorry it &apos;s so loud .
oh , i hear it &apos;s going well .
i &apos;m really happy for you and your husband .
yes , uh , there are a dozen supporters
staring at me right now .
good for you .
yes , i &apos;m gonna tell them about spoiler .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry , what ?
jeff dellinger is willing to talk .
so is kristen .
well , that &apos;s exciting .
what do you think will happen to running milk
stock prices when the world finds out
they &apos;re in bed with the nsa ?
okay , just @-@ just wait , h @-@ hold on .
amend the suit .
what ?
have kristen sue for gender discrimination
and we &apos;ll settle .
they &apos;d rather be seen as sexist
than in bed with the next edward snowden ?
of course they would , alicia .
don &apos;t be naive . $ 1.2 million .
take it to your client and we &apos;ll have a nice little chat .
she just said snowden .
what ?
alicia florrick .
she just said snowden .
the next snowden .
what was the context ?
it doesn &apos;t matter the context . she said it .
he &apos;s a brown target .
that &apos;s our second connection .
we can start listening to her again .
we just found our backdoor .
we just found our back ...
dude , what is this ?
goats singing , &quot; i will always love you . &quot;
