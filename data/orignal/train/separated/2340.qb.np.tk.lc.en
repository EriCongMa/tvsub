for over a century , i have lived in secret .
until now . i know the risk ,
but i have to know her .
i &apos;m elena .
i &apos;m stefan .
what are you ?
i &apos;m a vampire .
why are you here ?
i missed my little brother .
he told me about your ex , katherine .
she broke your heart .
that was a long time ago .
why do i look like her ?
our love for katherine , it wasn &apos;t real .
katherine never compelled me .
it &apos;s real for me .
are you psychic or clairvoyant ?
technically i &apos;m a witch .
that noise .
wait , what noise ?
tyler !
what the hell ? !
we need some help over here !
caroline !
tyler , have you talked to your mom ?
what is it ?
it &apos;s your dad .
he &apos;s dead .
you decided that i was worth saving ,
and i wanted to thank you ...
for that .
anna !
here . it &apos;s my blood .
if you die with it in your system ,
you &apos;ll come back .
anna &apos;s dead . i saw her killed .
i know you cared about her .
yeah , i did .
you scared me .
sorry .
is jenna home ?
she had to meet the fire chief about the building .
she doesn &apos;t know the truth .
they &apos;ve covered it up .
yeah , i know . how &apos;s jeremy ?
holed up in his room .
i looked everywhere .
what do you think , someone stole it ?
yeah . someone definitely took my stuff .
can i help ?
sure .
do you want me to pick you up ?
i &apos;m just gonna check on jeremy before i go to the hospital .
can you meet me there ?
you bet .
ok .
i love you , stefan .
i love you , too .
katherine ! ?
hello , john . goodbye , john .
jeremy ?
you up ?
911 , what &apos;s your emergency ?
hi , i need an ambulance to 2104 medford street .
behind you !
what ?
behind you !
jeremy !
jeremy !
jeremy !
please , jeremy , wake up !
he &apos;s ok .
what happened ?
he said that anna gave him her blood ,
and then he took these pills .
and now , i mean , he looks fine .
but then again so do you .
so i just-- i don &apos;t know .
come here , look at me .
no , i &apos;m fine , ok ? i feel exactly the same .
should i call a paramedic up here ? what should i do ?
no .
he &apos;s fine .
so you mean i &apos;m not a vampire ?
damn it .
don &apos;t say that .
jeremy--jeremy , why would you want that ?
did you hear about anna , what happened to her tonight ?
she &apos;s dead .
jeremy , jeremy , come here , sit down .
i am very sorry about anna .
but it &apos;s very important that you listen to me right now .
with every passing moment ,
anna &apos;s blood is leaving your system .
if you tried to kill yourself right now ,
you could really die .
hey ! do you understand me ?
stefan ...
yeah . i understand .
good .
what about the pills that he took ?
he didn &apos;t take enough to die .
so anna &apos;s blood actually healed him of that .
ms. gilbert .
i &apos;ll be right there .
you need to be at the hospital .
but ...
no , no , i &apos;ll stay here with jeremy .
no , i don &apos;t need a baby @-@ sitter .
yes , you do .
how &apos;s caroline ?
she &apos;s not good , bon .
what happened ?
we were driving and tyler heard this noise .
and he got--he got like this migraine or something .
and he lost control of the car .
and i thought that caroline was fine ,
and then--and then she wasn &apos;t , so ...
liz .
i came as soon as i got the message .
is she ok ?
she &apos;s in surgery . it &apos;s ...
they &apos;re doing everything they can .
i need your help , damon .
sure . anything , liz .
mayor lockwood is dead .
they thought he was a vampire .
they put him in the basement .
mayor lockwood was a vampire ?
no , no , no . a mistake was made .
they said he dropped like the others
when john &apos;s device went off , but he ...
he couldn &apos;t have been a vampire !
i &apos;ve known the man my whole life .
and now carol lockwood is going to want answers ,
and all i can think about right now is caroline .
and--and , um ...
it &apos;s ok . hey .
it &apos;s ok .
bonnie .
how &apos;s caroline ?
she &apos;s weakened .
they don &apos;t know if she &apos;s going to make it .
what ?
is there something that you can do ?
like a spell or something ?
she doesn &apos;t know how .
do you ?
no . i don &apos;t .
no , you don &apos;t . because it took
emily years to learn a spell like that .
oh , well , i can take down a vampire .
that spell was easy to learn .
i can give caroline some blood .
no . no way .
no , no , no , just enough to heal her .
she &apos;ll be safe in the hospital ,
and it &apos;ll be out of her system in a day .
she &apos;ll be better , elena .
it &apos;s too risky .
i can &apos;t agree to that .
do it .
this is caroline .
ok ? we can &apos;t let her die .
do it .
if i do this , you and me , call a truce .
no . but you &apos;ll do it anyway .
for elena .
uh--all right , i know this is probably
the last thing you want to do right now ,
but we should talk about what happened tonight .
yeah , one of the tomb vampires
got into the house and almost killed john !
what ? what--when ?
what are you talking about , after i left ?
you were there ?
come on , elena ,
you know i was .
when were you at the house ?
really ?
earlier .
on the porch . we were talking ,
all cathartic , feelings exposed .
come on , we kissed , elena .
ok ... i don &apos;t have time for this , damon .
hey . if you want to forget it happened , fine .
but i can &apos;t .
elena ! i came as soon as i got your message .
how is john ?
where have you been ?
at the fire department .
i had to fill out a report .
i told you earlier .
no , you didn &apos;t .
yes , i did .
no , jenna , you didn &apos;t .
yes , i did .
mmm , you gotta be kidding me .
how &apos;s caroline ?
not good .
just what i needed .
katherine .
at least i fooled one of you .
feel better ?
stefan ?
elena .
what happened ?
katherine happened .
did she say what she wanted ?
no .
woman certainly knows how to make an entrance .
she said she fooled one of us at least .
what does that-- what does that mean ?
she pretended to be elena , too ,
when i showed up earlier tonight .
i told jeremy .
i can &apos;t lie to him anymore .
are you all right ?
no , i &apos;m not all right .
i thought that with all the tomb vampires gone ,
things would be better .
i know .
we all did .
katherine was in this house .
that means that she &apos;s been invited in .
what are we going to do ?
move .
very helpful . thank you .
katherine wants you dead ,
there &apos;s zero you can do about it ,
you would be dead . but you &apos;re not .
so clearly she has other plans .
right , and we need to find out what those other plans are
and not provoke her in the process .
what happened tonight
when you thought she was elena ?
to risk another ... frown line
encroaching on a very crowded forehead ...
we ... kissed .
and you thought it was me ?
what do you mean , you kissed ?
well , you know ,
when two lips pucker , and they--
don &apos;t be obvious , stefan .
stefan , wait , he kissed katherine .
not me .
i wouldn &apos;t do that .
we don &apos;t have time for this , guys .
later .
jonh must know something .
there has to be a reason why katherine tried to kill him .
she &apos;s katherine .
she loves to play games , and you &apos;re fooling yourself
if you think you &apos;re going to find out what she &apos;s up to
before she wants you to know .
no , actually , elena &apos;s right .
jonh could know something through isabelle .
your mother , she was in touch with katherine ,
so maybe we can go to the hospital .
and talk .
i &apos;ve got a better idea .
what &apos;s that ?
i &apos;m just going to ignore the bitch .
see ya .
is that smart ?
if katherine thinks she &apos;s being ignored ,
it &apos;ll lure her out . she &apos;ll make a move .
yeah ? then what ?
stake her , rip her head off .
something poetic .
we &apos;ll see .
you been here all night ?
yeah , with the sheriff .
and no one else ?
stefan &apos;s brother damon stopped by late last night .
how is caroline today ?
see for yourself .
&quot; jersey shore &quot; is on .
ooh , careful !
i &apos;m still a little sore .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s ok .
but they say i &apos;m healing really quick now .
isn &apos;t he cute ?
why are you crying ?
i &apos;m just happy you &apos;re ok .
well , i love you guys !
we love you .
i want to know exactly who &apos;s responsible for killing my husband .
i &apos;m looking into it .
you have to be straight with me .
is there any reason richard was affected by the vampire device ?
what are you implying ? that he was one of them ? !
no , no , no one &apos;s implying that .
your deputy screwed up , plain and simple .
which makes you responsible .
carol--
your husband is the one
who helped jonh gilbert execute his idiot plan in the first place !
liz--
someone got my husband killed .
we &apos;re all on edge here .
you suffered a great loss .
the whole town has .
we have to stick together .
ok , trust each other .
we &apos;ll get through this .
so the black sheep returns .
tyler ?
yeah .
what happened to you ?
in my mind , you &apos;re 12 years old .
well , that &apos;s 2 years older
than the last time you saw me , uncle mason .
good to see you again .
it &apos;s good to see you , too .
come inside .
ready for this ?
john ?
i &apos;m elena , i &apos;m not-- i &apos;m not katherine .
we know she did this to you .
we need to know why .
where is she ?
you tell us .
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re a little too weak to play tough guy .
why don &apos;t you just sit back ,
answer a few questions .
please .
tell us why she &apos;s here .
what does she want ?
she &apos;ll try again .
we can &apos;t help you if you don &apos;t
confide in us .
in you ?
in your daughter , then .
my daughter should have driven a stake through your heart by now .
i haven &apos;t spoke with katherine directly .
she never trusted me .
so either kill me , or get out .
because i can &apos;t stand the sight of you with my daughter .
you see the problem with such hatred ?
it &apos;s gonna get you killed .
you may be ok with dying , but i have a better plan for you .
you now have my blood in your system .
all i have to do is kill you .
now take my advice--
leave town . elena doesn &apos;t want you here .
you have about 24 hours before the blood leaves your system .
that &apos;s enough time to disappear .
or so help me god , i will turn you into a vampire
and i will watch you hate yourself more than you already do .
clock starts now .
who &apos;s the guy with carol ?
that &apos;s mayor &apos;s younger brother , mason lockwood .
is he on the council ?
like john gilbert was when he rolled in ?
he &apos;s nothing like john .
for one , he &apos;s not an ass .
he &apos;s not a believer , either .
he wants nothing to do with the council .
he &apos;s too preoccupied finding the perfect wave .
hmm . thanks .
see ya .
hey , elena .
thanks for coming .
come on in .
hey . i just have to swing by home
and pick up jenna and jeremy so we can go to the lockwoods .
how did you leave it in there with john ?
i , uh ...
i asked him to leave town .
asked ?
you threatened him .
yeah , i threatened him .
good .
i want him gone , stefan .
i know that i shouldn &apos;t feel that way ,
but i don &apos;t want someone like that in my life .
or jeremy &apos;s life .
i know , i know .
so what now ?
now ...
i need to go find damon .
please , stefan , don &apos;t fight with him .
no , elena , he tried to kiss you . i &apos;m not ok with that .
that &apos;s not the problem .
katherine is .
she &apos;s already messing with both of your heads ,
and damon &apos;s not stable when it comes to her .
last thing we need is to make things worse .
did you know the gilbert device
affected tyler lockwood ?
i know it took the mayor down .
don &apos;t you want to know why ?
yes , bonnie , i would love to know why
a non @-@ vampire
was tortured by the vampire torture device
that you let john gilbert use against us .
speaking of your guilt , how &apos;s caroline ?
she &apos;s much better .
you &apos;re welcome .
no , you &apos;re welcome .
how am i welcome ?
you &apos;ll live to see another day .
no good deed goes unpunished with you , does it ?
doesn &apos;t undo the bad .
i know what you are , damon . you might have elena
and the sheriff and everybody else fooled , but not me .
hmm . one wrong move ,
and i &apos;m gonna take you out .
now you need to stop with the witch &apos;s brew .
you &apos;re starting to believe your own press .
i &apos;m sorry .
you were saying ?
oh , god .
damon drives me crazy .
he &apos;s walking around like he &apos;s some kind of hero
for healing caroline , when it &apos;s his fault
all this happened in the first place .
i &apos;m sorry , bonnie .
what damon &apos;s done is just awful .
ok .
better . hateful damon moment over .
thanks .
i gotta find tyler and pay my respects .
i &apos;ll be back .
ok .
hello ?
elena , where are you ?
bonnie , i know .
i &apos;m late . i &apos;m getting in the car now .
i &apos;ll be there in five .
we haven &apos;t officially met .
i &apos;m katherine .
i know who you are .
of course you do .
you &apos;re the best friend , right ?
i &apos;ve been putting all the pieces of elena &apos;s life together .
isabelle told me it was a bit of a puzzle .
i do know who jenna and jeremy are .
and i &apos;ve met that delicious ex @-@ boyfriend matt ,
who &apos;s sweet on caroline ,
and then there &apos;s you ,
the vampire hating bennett witch .
did i do good ?
i &apos;ve been around a long time , bonnie .
you &apos;re gonna have to do better than that .
nice .
katherine .
stefan .
leave her alone .
ok .
what are you doing here ?
after the way you treated me last night ,
i thought that a public place would be less violent .
taking this a little far , don &apos;t you think ?
elena could walk in at any moment .
mmm , but that &apos;s part of the fun , stefan .
damon &apos;s here , somewhere .
i &apos;ve been avoiding him .
hey , guys .
hey , matt .
i , uh , i heard that caroline was doing much better .
her recovery was practically miraculous .
you must be so relieved .
i am .
thanks , elena .
his eyes are so blue .
you need to leave now .
you &apos;re hurting my feelings , stefan .
damon was much happier to see me .
then again , he thought i was your girlfriend .
so . katherine , i &apos;m not doing this with you .
ok , how about we don &apos;t have a couple &apos;s fight
in front of all your friends .
walk with me ?
just tell me what you &apos;re doing here .
maybe i missed you .
is that an acceptable reason ?
what game are you playing ?
why , you want to play with me ?
i don &apos;t know .
how can i play if i don &apos;t know the rules ?
no rules , stefan .
don &apos;t you remember ?
no rules .
looks like the whole town has turned out .
yeah , well , he is--
he was the mayor .
why don &apos;t they save it for the funeral ?
it &apos;s what people do .
the lockwoods were here for us when we went through this .
it &apos;ll be quick .
we &apos;ll drop off the food and pay our respects and go .
in and out ? sounds like a plan .
you guys go ahead .
i &apos;ll , um , i &apos;ll be right there , ok ?
hey . how are you doing ?
great , elena . walkin &apos; on sunshine .
thanks for asking .
damon ...
elena ...
we should be able to talk about this .
damon , we &apos;re close enough now .
i really want to know how you &apos;re doing .
i kissed you , i thought you kissed me back .
doppelganger hijinks ensued .
how do you think i &apos;m doing ?
i think that you &apos;re hurt .
hmm . oh , i don &apos;t get hurt , elena .
no , you don &apos;t admit that you get hurt .
you get angry and cover it up ,
and then you do something stupid .
you &apos;re scared .
you think katherine &apos;s going to send me
off the deep end , don &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t need to hurt for that .
you know , why--
why is it such a surprise
that i would kiss you ?
that &apos;s not a surprise .
i &apos;m surprised that you thought i would kiss you back .
now i &apos;m hurt .
elena !
bonnie , what happened ?
oh , hey , sorry . i was just looking for the , uh--
the bathroom &apos;s down the hall .
hey , look , i &apos;m--
i &apos;m sorry about your dad .
today &apos;s been a big day of sorrys
from people who really don &apos;t give a crap .
i remember when my dad died ,
i had a house full of strangers
telling me what a great guy he was .
anyway , i know how hard all this is .
difference is , in your case , it was true .
my dad was a dick .
yeah , yeah , he was .
i found this in his desk .
he won &apos;t mind , he &apos;s dead .
yeah , you know what , sure .
why not .
hey , what &apos;s going on in here , tyler ?
nothing . nothing .
you got somewhere else to be ?
the lockwoods have a lot more land than they used to .
the possessions of all the tomb vampires
built them quite a fortune .
yeah , why did you want them dead , hmm ?
you &apos;re the one who turned most of them .
there &apos;s nothing more annoying
than a vengeful vampire , stefan .
just ask john gilbert .
you haven &apos;t changed at all , have you ?
but you have .
you &apos;re stronger .
meaner . it &apos;s sexy .
don &apos;t flirt with me , katherine .
i &apos;m not damon .
i haven &apos;t spent 145 years obsessed with you .
yeah .
based on your choice of women ,
i &apos;d say otherwise .
though i &apos;ll admit ,
it does bother me that you &apos;ve fallen in love with somebody else .
i was never in love with you , katherine .
you compelled me .
so none of my feelings were real .
believe what you want , stefan .
but i know the truth .
and deep down , so do you .
the truth ? mm @-@ hmm .
well , the truth is , you &apos;re the same
lying , selfish ,
manipulative bitch that you &apos;ve always been .
so whatever it is that you &apos;re doing here ,
why don &apos;t you just get on with it and leave town .
because if you don &apos;t ,
i will hunt you down and i will rip your heart out .
you want to know why i &apos;m here , stefan ?
i came back for you .
well , the problem , katherine ...
is that i hate you .
you hate me , huh ?
that sounds like the beginning of a love story ,
stefan , not the end of one .
are you gonna be ok ?
yeah . it &apos;ll heal .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
i was trying to figure her out .
i was playing along , i let her get to me .
we tried to track her ,
but she &apos;s gone . ooh , cover up , fabio .
we got a crazy ex on the loose .
better watch out ,
looks like katherine &apos;s trying to steal your guy .
that &apos;s not what &apos;s happening .
isn &apos;t it ? i mean , it &apos;s only fair , since i ...
went after your girl .
i &apos;m gonna go check on jenna and jeremy .
let me know when you guys are done .
so what &apos;s it going to be , huh ?
fight to the death .
go ahead , take your threats , stake your claim .
i &apos;m not going to fight you .
why ? ! i &apos;d fight me .
katherine &apos;s going to try to play us against each other .
you do know that , right ?
brother , don &apos;t you worry .
our bond is unbreakable !
we need to stay united against her .
so , yes , as much as i would like to kill you ,
i &apos;m not going to fight you .
i kissed elena .
because you feel something for her .
because you actually care .
and i &apos;m not going to let katherine
come in here and destroy that part of you
that has finally , after all of this time ,
willing to feel something .
she &apos;ll try to break you .
she &apos;ll try to break us .
and how we respond to that will define us .
it &apos;s our choice .
so , no . i &apos;m not going to fight you .
jeremy .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m packing .
leaving .
so you figured you &apos;d kill all your evil vampires ,
and then you &apos;d leave town ?
not all , but enough . for now .
can you tell elena i said good @-@ bye ?
why don &apos;t you tell her yourself ?
you know , jeremy , i was taught to hate them .
the vampires .
it &apos;s what i know . it &apos;s what your father knew .
my father would have seen things differently .
no , he may have done things differently ,
but there &apos;s no other way to see it .
that ring on your finger , the one that &apos;s supposed to protect you ,
that was my father &apos;s , right ?
yeah .
then why didn &apos;t it protect him ? why is he still dead ?
what happened to your parents wasn &apos;t supernatural .
it was an accident .
there &apos;s nothing that can save us from that .
i wonder what he &apos;d think of all this ,
of me .
he &apos;d think that you &apos;re still young .
you &apos;re still finding yourself .
but you are a gilbert ,
and you &apos;ve been exposed to this town &apos;s darkest secret ,
and with that comes responsibility .
i don &apos;t believe in that family legacy stuff .
sooner or later , you &apos;ll have to .
tyler !
what are you doing ?
i hate him .
oh , don &apos;t say that !
let go of me !
get off me ! hey !
tyler ! hey , hey !
i said get off me !
tyler !
get off me !
look at me . look at me .
calm down .
settle down .
very brave of you to come here .
i wanted to say good @-@ bye .
leaving so soon ?
i know where i &apos;m not wanted .
don &apos;t pout .
it &apos;s not attractive on a woman your age .
what , no good @-@ bye kiss ?
why don &apos;t i kill you instead ?
what are you doing here ?
nostalgia , curiosity , et. cetera .
i &apos;m better at the enigmatic one @-@ liners , katherine .
what are you up to ?
trust me , damon . when i &apos;m up to something ,
you &apos;ll know it .
come on . kiss me .
or kill me .
which will it be , damon ?
we both know that you &apos;re only capable of one .
my sweet , innocent damon .
that &apos;s more like it .
wait .
brief pause .
i have a question .
answer it , and it &apos;s back to fireworks
and rocket &apos;s red glare .
answer it right , and ...
i &apos;ll forget the last 145 years i &apos;ve spent missing you .
i &apos;ll forget ...
how much i loved you . i &apos;ll forget everything
and we can start over .
this can be our defining moment .
because we have time .
that &apos;s the beauty of eternity .
i just need the truth , just once .
stop .
i already know your question .
and its answer .
the truth is ...
i &apos;ve never loved you .
it was always stefan .
you scared me .
just doing my part in the neighborhood watch .
thanks .
for , um ,
looking out for us . for me .
that &apos;s me , your trusty bodyguard .
calm in a crisis .
have you been drinking ?
and you &apos;re upset .
that &apos;s not a good combination .
no , i &apos;m not upset .
upset is an emotion specific to those who care .
come on , damon . that &apos;s a lie .
you care .
you &apos;re surprised that i thought you would kiss me back ?
you can &apos;t imagine that i &apos;d believe that you &apos;d want to ?
damon ...
that what we &apos;ve been doing here
means something ?
you &apos;re the liar , elena .
there is something going on between the two of us ,
and you know it . and you &apos;re lying to me ,
and you &apos;re lying to stefan , and most of all ,
you &apos;re lying to yourself .
i can prove it .
no ...
damon , don &apos;t !
what &apos;s wrong with you ? !
lie about this .
stop it .
you &apos;re better than this , come on .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
no , no , no , damon !
i care about you . listen to me , i care about you .
i do , but ... i love stefan .
it &apos;s always going to be stefan .
elena , what &apos;s going on here ?
nothing , jeremy . it &apos;s ok . just--
just go back to bed .
no , it &apos;s not ok , elena .
he wants to be a vampire .
no , damon , stop it !
you want to shut out the pain ?
it &apos;s the easiest thing in the world .
the part of you that cares , it just goes away !
all you have to do is flip the switch and snap !
damon ! no !
your mom &apos;s out .
i think she popped a couple pharmaceuticals .
i didn &apos;t mean to freak her out .
i don &apos;t know why i get like this .
it &apos;s the curse of being a lockwood .
so how did you get the chill gene ?
i didn &apos;t .
i &apos;ve just learned how to manage it .
i don &apos;t want to be like this anymore .
none of us do .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a curse , tyler .
he saw the ring , that &apos;s why he did it . he knew .
he didn &apos;t see the ring .
it &apos;s katherine .
she got under his skin .
she undid everything that was good about him .
there is nothing good about him .
stefan , not anymore .
he &apos;s decided what he wants .
he doesn &apos;t want to feel , he wants to be hated .
it &apos;s just easier that way .
he got his wish .
i hate him , stefan .
i know .
is he ok ? stefan , is he ok ?
he &apos;s ok .
shh . you &apos;re ok .
he killed me . damon killed me .
shh , it &apos;s ok .
oh , god .
