i saw him in the woods .
he left an &quot; a &quot; message .
what did you see ?
enough .
noel kahn is &quot; a. &quot;
don &apos;t say anything to anyone . promise me .
your mother thinks you &apos;re keeping some kind of secret .
i &apos;m ... gay .
why didn &apos;t she tell us ?
she was afraid .
this is what she &apos;s afraid of .
lucas , i am being honest with you . i have a boyfriend .
and i think you deserve a better boyfriend .
somebody decided to pay a visit to alison &apos;s memorial .
mom , this is alex santiago .
good serve .
from the club .
i &apos;m the last potter .
when i go , that &apos;s the end of the line .
we &apos;re married .
spence , what just happened ?
who wrote that ?
what ? what &apos;s on there ?
get it off ! just wipe it off !
get it off me !
why are you taking that off ?
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m trying to keep it on .
believe me , i don &apos;t want to see the autograph that &apos;s under it .
we can get you another sticker .
this time , why don &apos;t you try something mellower ,
like &quot; save the planet &quot; ?
there were not a lot of choices , okay ?
it was either humpty dumpty
or &quot; jesus is coming . look busy . &quot;
oh , god , it &apos;s still there .
hanna . hanna , don &apos;t , okay ?
don &apos;t look at that .
just look around you , &apos; cause you &apos;re safe ,
you &apos;re home , and you &apos;re alive .
i thought i was safe in my hospital room , too .
what &apos;s going on with noel kahn ?
is he &quot; a &quot; ? have you talked to him ?
no , i avoid him .
i keep telling him i &apos;m busy--
busy freaking out every time i look at him .
yeah , well , try being run over by him .
who got you this panda ?
sean ?
lucas .
oh , sweet .
anyone else starving , or is it just me ?
your mom said she left a special dinner for you in the fridge .
pass .
i want a pop @-@ tart .
what ?
i &apos;ve been on hospital food for three weeks .
i want to eat something that
doesn &apos;t look like it &apos;s already been chewed .
why don &apos;t you eat while we go get the rest of your stuff .
&apos;kay ?
hanna ?
hey , so , if you &apos;re gonna stay down here tonight ,
we were , um ...
yeah , yeah , yeah . down here &apos;s good .
what happened ?
nothin &apos; .
just knocked a few boxes down .
no , no , no , no . you don &apos;t have to clean .
uh , you can go . seriously ,
my mom &apos;s gonna be here soon .
wait ... so now you want us to leave ?
you don &apos;t have to put on a brave face for us , okay ?
we get it . if being alone is freaking you out ,
we can absolutely stay as long as you ...
no , no , no . i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m fuzzy ,
and i think it &apos;s from this pain medication .
yeah , i need a nap .
okay . can we help you to the couch ?
no , you &apos;ve done enough .
seriously , you guys , go .
okay . call me ?
yeah .
yeah . me , too , any time .
you know you have to boil that first , right ?
yeah .
你能摆脱腿上放的犯罪证据吗 -a
so , do you like ? .
i could go back and get the one with a built @-@ in heating pad .
what happened to the no @-@ spending zone ?
honey , you are gonna be on the couch a lot .
you should at least be comfortable .
last month , we could barely afford basic cable
and bubble bath ,
and now you &apos;re ...
i told you , things are better now .
the bank loan came through .
in a lasagna box ?
as i see , you &apos;ve had time to go exploring while i was out .
mom , there are thousands of dollars in there .
hanna ...
we were days away from a foreclosure .
where &apos;d it come from ?
the bank .
it is a loan .
unauthorized .
yeah , but what does that mean ?
it means just what i said . i borrowed it ,
from a customer who will never know it was borrowed
because it &apos;s all gonna be replaced by the end of the year .
so you stole it ?
listen to me . this is our lifeline .
i was able to get our mortgage current ,
and what &apos;s left in this box is our cushion .
and i will pay it all back . all of it .
how ?
mom ?
i never intended for you to know about it . that &apos;s why i hid it .
i figured in a box of carbs
that &apos;s been sitting up there untouched for 10 years
was a safer bet than my old makeup bag .
my mistake .
this is my problem .
you just need to worry about getting better , okay ?
okay . i &apos;m gonna take a shower .
i like these sausages . what are they , chicken ?
no , they &apos;re turkey .
so , does your friend have any allergies ?
what ?
is there anything i should know about what maya eats ?
no . she eats everything .
dad , i know i asked for it ,
but if mom can &apos;t handle this dinner tonight ,
i &apos;ll just tell maya ...
we &apos;re looking forward to it .
your mother was up all last night preparing the menu .
you don &apos;t think she &apos;ll try and poison her , do you ?
your mother ?
that &apos;s not her style .
she &apos;d kill her with kindness .
get in .
i can &apos;t .
my mom will be out any second .
and she &apos;s not gonna believe
that you came all this way just for coffee .
well , i didn &apos;t . i came for the kiss .
let &apos;s do this later .
yeah .
okay .
no , honey , leave the boxes there for now .
do not call her . it &apos;s their honeymoon .
okay . bye .
what &apos;s going on ?
ian had all his boxes
delivered this morning from his storage unit .
it couldn &apos;t wait till they got back ?
i &apos;m guessing he and melissa
probably want to get a jumpstart on settling in .
why are you so shocked ?
because you &apos;re not .
you and dad are acting as if
you &apos;re totally okay with this whole elopement thing .
you don &apos;t think this was rushed ?
of course it &apos;s rushed . it &apos;s outrageous .
i &apos;m not dancing a jig over it ,
but what &apos;s done is done .
besides , a long engagement
doesn &apos;t guarantee wedded bliss either .
oh , honey , would you hold this ? i &apos;m buzzing .
oh , speak of the devil .
ian ?
mnh . melissa .
another picture .
the honeymooners .
where are they ?
looks like that mall near dad &apos;s office .
i guess when you &apos;re in love , you can be anywhere .
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s weird ,
melissa trading in her princess gown and pink champagne
for a food court slurpee ?
spencer , you were a big part of your sister &apos;s rough year .
maybe you could just be happy for her .
why is he out of jail ?
he &apos;s out on bail .
he &apos;s probably meeting with his attorney .
honey , you &apos;ll be late ,
and staring at him won &apos;t make him disappear .
come on . let &apos;s go .
ooh . maybe we should just give her one book at a time .
hanna doesn &apos;t really do well with stacks--
unless they &apos;re catalogues .
hi , maya .
hey there .
are you still coming for dinner tonight ?
sure , if your folks still want me to .
what should i wear ?
anything . doesn &apos;t matter .
a dress .
a dress ? seriously ?
is this some sort of formal thingy ,
or are you just worried my jeans are too butch ?
don &apos;t say things like that , please , okay ?
they &apos;re not-- they won &apos;t laugh .
well , i &apos;ll see you guys later , so ,
have fun tonight , but , fyi ,
if you decide to wear jeans , iron them .
emily ...
are you still into this dinner ?
of course .
i just ...
my parents have been acting strange
since i told them about me .
us .
define &quot; strange . &quot;
whispering , closing doors ,
changing the channel when ellen comes on .
got it .
i will wear the girliest dress i own .
i &apos;ll tell them i sewed it myself .
maya , this isn &apos;t a joke .
my mom isn &apos;t your mom , okay ?
gatsby ...
was more than just a pretty face .
he was ambitious , ruthless , charming ,
and the themes of change and loss
are central to both novels .
did everybody get their papers back ?
perfect !
see you wednesday .
oh , chapters one and four . no study guides , please .
read the man , not the blogger .
you guys go ahead .
i &apos;ll get hanna &apos;s assignment and meet up with you .
i know who wrote that message on your car .
it was noel kahn .
but he admitted it was stupid .
he was just angry and jealous .
yeah , i get why he did it .
who else knows ?
nobody . nobody else knows .
look , and he &apos;s not gonna tell anyone .
how do you know that ?
because ... i think he may have known about us
for a while now ,
but if he was trying to hurt us ,
he would have said something a long time ago .
but he promised he &apos;d just forget what he saw .
look , let &apos;s not talk about this here .
can i come to your place later ?
i &apos;m just not sure i want to be there .
it &apos;ll be fine .
just ... make sure maya doesn &apos;t do all the talking .
if she starts going over a cliff , you grab the wheel .
spencer , emily , wait up .
i just found out that hanna &apos;s mom &apos;s got
some bank thing in scranton
and won &apos;t be home till really late , so ...
i want to do a surprise party .
you know , &quot; welcome home , hanna .
we love you , with or without your spleen . &quot;
i &apos;ve checked with mr. hanna ,
and sean is totally down with it .
they ... didn &apos;t take out her spleen .
really ? oh .
then i &apos;ll just change the theme .
mona ...
i &apos;m really not sure hanna &apos;s up to hosting
a bunch of people at a party .
oh , please . she &apos;s been socializing with
i.v. bags and bedpans .
she &apos;ll love it .
if you guys don &apos;t want to come , i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll understand .
mr. fitz ?
got a second ?
uh ... sure .
what &apos;s up , noel ?
wanted to talk to you about something .
these comments on my paper .
pretty harsh .
oh . i wasn &apos;t trying to be .
i worked really hard on this .
i &apos;m sure you did ,
but you clearly hadn &apos;t read all the material .
i think i know ... enough ...
to get a better grade than this .
what are you asking me to do , noel ?
change the grade ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s not gonna happen .
mr. fitz ,
you don &apos;t want me to bring the principal into this , do you ?
take another read . you may have second thoughts .
i think it deserves this .
hey there .
turns out there &apos;s this surprise party for hanna ,
so i &apos;m thinking , um , i &apos;ll just go there first
and then come by .
you &apos;re not coming over .
why ? what happened ?
i had a visit from your friend noel .
turns out he &apos;s not too good at keeping promises .
in fact , he &apos;s not at all who you think he is .
did he say something to you ?
ezra .
tell me what-- what happened ?
maybe i can fix it .
mr. fitz .
what can i do for you , jenna ?
mr. mazarra said you need to sign my absence card .
sure . let me ... let me get a pen .
here you go .
thank you .
sorry to interrupt .
hey , i &apos;m sorry . practice ran late .
what &apos;s this ?
member of the club gave it to me .
it &apos;s a tennis clinic in sweden .
sweden ? why did he give it to you ?
he wants me to apply .
a lot of the people who go to it
end up playing in the swedish open .
alex , that &apos;s amazing ! you have to do it !
maybe i could get an internship over there ,
like in stockholm or something .
spencer , slow down . i &apos;m not going .
why ? if this guy recommended you ,
he must think you &apos;re up to it .
i think you &apos;re up to it . you are fantastic .
i can &apos;t go .
i told my uncle i &apos;d work for him .
he needs the bodies .
your uncle can find other bodies to help him rip down buildings .
this is a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity .
i don &apos;t want to go .
so you &apos;d rather spend the rest of your summer
tossing broken plaster in a dumpster ?
that &apos;s insane .
maybe to you .
i &apos;m not interested in playing pro .
i &apos;d rather be here , working , saving for college .
okay , i get that , and that &apos;s good , but ...
how can you turn this down ?
like this .
so , you ready ?
so ...
where in texas will you be stationed ?
fort hood . but i &apos;m not leaving just yet .
no , thank you .
i don &apos;t eat seafood .
it &apos;s not a moral thing . i get hives .
oh . i &apos;m sorry .
emily said that you could eat anything , so ...
i forgot . sorry .
it &apos;s okay . um ...
i &apos;m really sorry .
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s fine .
are both your folks from california , maya ?
yeah . they , uh ...
they met in berkley at a no @-@ nukes rally .
after my brother and i came along ,
they got married , and we moved to san jose .
so you were already here when your parents got married ?
i was the flower girl .
oh , um , i guess they wanted to make sure it was real
before they tied the knot .
two children wasn &apos;t real enough ?
um ... tell the story of how your dad asked your mom .
so , my dad &apos;s this raging , crazy romantic .
he proposed to my mom with a sharpie .
oh , he didn &apos;t have a ring ,
so he drew one on her finger with a felt pen .
that &apos;s a very clever placeholder .
no , that &apos;s the only one she &apos;s ever had .
once the ink wore off ,
she retraced it with a tattoo .
wow . see , now why didn &apos;t i think of that ?
excuse me while i check on the roast .
and honey , be careful . our anniversary is coming up .
i &apos;m gonna invest in some felt @-@ tip markers .
so , where you going after this ?
what are you talking about ?
well , when my mom told me
you were gonna give up your friday night
to help me study math ...
i never said math .
i said i would get you up to speed .
so ... can we discuss claudia rice ?
i don &apos;t know who that is .
yes , you do . skinny , skinny jeans .
won &apos;t wear anything unless it &apos;s tight enough
to make blood come out of her ears .
whoa , what was that ?
what was what ?
i just saw a shadow at your door .
no , wait , mona , don &apos;t open the door .
call the police .
oh , hush , baby jane .
mona , don &apos;t !
surprise !
uh , noel , what-- what are you doing ?
please don &apos;t open that .
jackpot .
that &apos;s it , noel ! we &apos;re over !
what ?
happy now ?
what happened ?
i just put noel kahn back on the market .
how ? you broke them up ?
we broke them up .
aren &apos;t you still crushing on him , aria ?
what did &quot; we &quot; do , alison ?
what &apos;s with the &apos; tude , guys ?
i did it for aria .
i only kill when we need food .
and when i &apos;m bored .
buona sera .
hey , lucas .
long time , no talk . how are you ?
thirsty .
you can have your own cup .
so ... were you surprised ?
yeah . i still am .
did you get my e @-@ mails ?
yeah , i got &apos; em .
well , you know , i &apos;m behind in every class ,
so , if you want to study together ...
i &apos;m kind of off studying at the moment .
been there , done that .
this semester , i plan to go from honor roll to toilet roll .
what is this ?
yeah , i would slow down on that .
mona made that , so ...
i &apos;m fine , mom .
i &apos;m not driving ,
and this isn &apos;t my first time playing margaritaville .
want some ?
hanna @-@ banana , where is that photo of you and me at the lake ?
you know , the one where we won the chicken fight .
i don &apos;t remember , sean . sure you do .
it &apos;s you and sean .
me tarzan , you jane austen .
you got a problem ?
nope . mnh @-@ mnh . just amusing myself .
did i embarrass you ?
sorry , about the shrimp thing .
had i eaten that , i would have blown up .
stop .
they really liked you .
dad was definitely hooked , and mom liked the dress .
wait till she sees the crease in my jeans .
do you want to change before we go to hanna &apos;s ?
would it be okay if i bailed on that ?
i &apos;m exhausted . i didn &apos;t sleep last night .
i was way too nervous .
about dinner ?
because when i saw you at school , you were totally all right .
one of us had to hold it together .
you were one buckle short of a straitjacket .
i didn &apos;t mean to interrupt .
i just wanted to make sure
and give maya something to take to her folks .
that &apos;s so sweet . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
enjoy .
thank you .
here you go .
thanks .
so , um , i was thinking--
my parents have this little place up in bucks county .
what if we , uh , could sneak away up there next weekend ?
please just don &apos;t say no until i at least show you a picture .
you had me at &quot; i was thinking . &quot;
what just happened ?
nothing . i just--
just a little bit busy , here .
well , let &apos;s go outside .
okay . i &apos;ll meet you out there .
i &apos;m just gonna go upstairs and use the bathroom .
okay .
there you are ! where you been ?
sean got this amazing
picture of hanna &apos;s face when we surprised her .
she might have peed herself . it was classic .
you broke your promise .
you promised me you &apos;d forget what you saw in mr. fitz &apos;s car ,
but you &apos;re not letting it go .
back up . what are we talking about ?
you know exactly what i &apos;m talking about , okay ?
and you can &apos;t just blackmail him ... !
blackmail ? is that what he said ?
you never demanded a better grade ?
i didn &apos;t demand anything .
i asked him to take a second look at my essay .
i mean , haven &apos;t you ever worked hard
and thought you deserved something better than what you got ?
wow .
if that &apos;s the story he put out there ,
then you &apos;ve really got to wonder who this guy is .
noel ...
is there something else going on here ?
is there some old grudge you &apos;ve got against me and my friends ?
noel , come check this out .
pritzker &apos;s got this video of the barracuda game .
it &apos;s your shining moment , dude .
did jenna tell you i tried to reach you ,
when you were still in jail ?
no .
well , i did .
i wanted you to know that i wasn &apos;t the one .
i never told the police where you were .
i gotta go .
where ?
there &apos;s a @-@ a party at hanna &apos;s .
lucky you .
i can barely leave my porch .
but that &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t get many invitations .
just death threats .
do you believe me ?
that &apos;s what i asked you ,
before the cops picked me up .
i never got an answer either .
hey , hold still .
look , would you be cool if i left a little early ?
now ?
where you going ? hot faculty party ?
it was a joke .
was it ?
aria .
no , it bothers you , me and ezra . i can ...
i can tell by the way you &apos;re looking at me .
i mean , come on . it &apos;s not like things aren &apos;t different now .
parties like this must feel like you &apos;re babysitting .
wh-- ? i don &apos;t feel like that at all .
i @-@ i never should have told you guys .
no , you should have told us a long time ago ,
when it started .
i mean , this whole time , i thought i was helping you
get over this viking boy in iceland
who , turns out , doesn &apos;t exist .
i mean , i thought we were close .
we tell each other everything .
i couldn &apos;t . i swore to ezra that he could trust me .
well , we trusted you too .
right .
and now i &apos;ve blown it with everyone .
it took forever to get into that bathroom .
mona was spending quality time with her eyebrows .
hey , what &apos;s wrong ?
i @-@ i &apos;m gonna take off .
why , where are we going ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing , but i &apos;m going home .
couldn &apos;t resist , could you ?
what am i looking at ?
an e @-@ mailed confirmation
of my application to that tennis clinic .
okay .
which was sent in electronically .
you think i did that ?
you &apos;re the only person i told .
yeah , but i didn &apos;t .
spencer , get real .
okay , you and i want different things ,
and you say that you &apos;re okay with that ,
but you &apos;re not , and you never will be .
i did not send that in ,
but i apologize if i made you feel like--
don &apos;t apologize for who you are and what you want .
i &apos;m not going to .
亲亲抱抱 a
and she &apos;s all , like ...
and so now , hanna &apos;s on top of the bunny hill ,
but i had to , like , hypnotize her
to get her to grab on to the tow rope .
okay , i was freezing .
you were freaked .
no , sean , my eyelashes were cracking off .
she says to me ... &quot; s @-@ s @-@ sean ,
c @-@ can you c @-@ carry me down , p @-@ please ? &quot;
and i &apos;m like , &quot; babe , i &apos;m right next to you .
you &apos;ll be fine . &quot;
oh , her trusty st. bernard .
you can snowplow the whole way down .
&quot; and if you fall , i &apos;ll drag you back to the bus
and get you drunk so i can lick your face . &quot;
what did you say ?
i mean , so what if they &apos;re lousy guard dogs ?
they &apos;re big and they &apos;re goofy ,
and if you can get past buckets of drool ...
i think hermie the hermaphrodite needs a jumbo coffee .
i mean , who does not want a big , slobbering beast
who can catch a ball in the end zone ?
that &apos;s it .
fight , fight , fight !
don &apos;t hit him !
sean ! sean ! stop !
it &apos;s like fighting a kid that needs a telethon .
lucas ,
can i please talk to you outside ?
what &apos;s his deal ?
lucas , did you come here to welcome me home
or to pick a fight with sean ?
hey , it &apos;s not my fault some people are trapped
between neanderthal and cro @-@ magnon .
h @-@ he is not the one that you &apos;re angry at .
you came here to get back at me .
breaking news , princess .
not everything is about you .
well , then why did you cut me off ?
i wasn &apos;t the one who did the cutting , remember ?
i want to be your friend , lucas , but i just--
no ! you people just think you can push me around
like some kind of mop ! and you &apos;re no different !
you &apos;re no different from the rest of alison &apos;s anointed !
what ?
you let her march around
and act like some 17th @-@ century torture squads ,
and considering what that bitch did to me ,
i should have done way worse to her !
what are you talking about ?
what did you do to alison ?
dying doesn &apos;t make you a saint .
not when you spent all of junior high being a monster .
do you know what it &apos;s like
to walk through this town every single day
and look at some shrine to her ?
that was you who destroyed the memorial ?
you can call the cops .
tell them to meet me in my driveway .
it will take me 11 minutes to walk home .
lucas , i &apos;m not gonna call the cops .
i think that we can keep this between us .
you &apos;ve already been through enough already .
don &apos;t . stop .
please .
don &apos;t make me like you .
it &apos;s too hard .
is he gone ?
you shouldn &apos;t be alone with him .
that kid is cracked .
yeah , well , anyone can surprise you .
who are we talking about ?
you and noel are best buds , right ?
how well do you really know him ?
oh , i get it .
your friend &apos;s a certified loony tune ,
so now you want to pick on mine ?
sean , everyone &apos;s got a life that no one else knows about .
i mean , who is noel when he &apos;s not with you ?
hanna , you &apos;re freaking me out .
why don &apos;t you just come inside and try to have some fun .
you know , people are asking all about--
you know what ? just tell them to go home .
okay ?
i just want everyone to go home .
you need to call alex .
and tell him what ?
i can &apos;t undo this without telling him about &quot; a. &quot;
unless you think i should go into the kitchen
and ask &quot; a &quot; to put down the piece of pizza and call alex himself .
stop .
we don &apos;t know that noel is that person .
and besides , i &apos;m not even sure what &quot; a &quot; wants anymore .
are you ?
you know what happens when you stick four lobsters
in a tank and cut off their food supply ?
they start to eat each other .
can i get to the bathroom ?
is there a magic password ?
okay , if we find out that he is
who we think he is ,
then what are we prepared to do about it ?
you hungry ?
no .
you never told me that emily tried to talk to me .
why would i ?
what can she say now that &apos;s gonna make it better ?
she wasn &apos;t the one that turned me in .
i know that .
how ?
because i did .
look , toby ,
if you &apos;re running around like you &apos;re some kind of fugitive ,
how are you gonna prove that you &apos;re innocent ?
you need to be home ...
... where you &apos;re safe .
you could chain me to this porch ,
and i &apos;d still never touch you like that again .
who do you think you &apos;re talking to ?
hello ?
is someone there ?
hello ?
is someone upstairs ?
damn it !
god !
oh , god !
what happened in here ?
i @-@ i thought that someone ... was in here .
yeah .
looks like a lot more than someone . you had a party ?
mona invited people over . i had no idea .
hi . how was the party ?
uh , just okay .
hanna wasn &apos;t really in the party mode .
well , can you blame her ?
that girl doesn &apos;t need any more surprises
for at least a couple of years , right ?
is dad sleeping ?
you know what ? after you left , he got a phone call .
the commander wants him in texas by the end of the month .
this month ? why ? he just got home .
i know , emily . it &apos;s not his decision .
there &apos;s just a bigger picture .
tonight meant a lot to me .
thank you .
maya had a great time .
your father thinks she &apos;s very sweet .
she is .
and i &apos;m glad you &apos;re okay with it .
i &apos;m not okay with it .
the whole thing makes me sick .
sick to my stomach .
hey , dad .
hey , spence .
didn &apos;t even know you were here .
i would have watched the game downstairs with you .
your mother makes me watch it on mute .
just got home .
he &apos;s got a lot of stuff , ian .
yeah .
suddenly he &apos;s , uh , everywhere , isn &apos;t he ?
well , maybe it &apos;ll inspire your sister to finish that condo
so they can move in .
dad ...

but if i start listing them , i &apos;ll never fall asleep .
i spoke to a friend of mine on the police force tonight .
the bloodstain they found on that sweater at toby cavanaugh &apos;s
was a positive match .
i don &apos;t think that kid &apos;s
gonna be around much longer to scare you .
it &apos;s alison &apos;s blood ?

they &apos;re not going to investigate anyone else ?
i thought you &apos;d be relieved .
