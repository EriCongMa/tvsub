you got your seat cushion ?
yeah they &apos;re in the back .
lyle you got your jacket ?
mom i know how to dress for a football game .
you know whenever we get there you &apos;re always cold .
he &apos;s ok . where are the tickets ?
i thought you got them .
you said you grabbed them .
if it wasn &apos;t for me you guys would be lost .
lyle you left this door open !
sam !
let &apos;s go . we &apos;re gonna miss kickoff .
what if it &apos;s jenny ?
call her from the car . you know your daughter .
she probably just wants to talk about a new dress she bought .
come on . come on .
mom dad this is jenny .
i &apos;m in trouble .
i &apos;m in so much trouble .
i know you taught me to not be afraid
but i &apos;m so afraid .
when you get this message ...
i &apos;ll probably be dead .
so i just wanted to tell you that ...
oh god please pick up the phone !
please !
i hope you want me to come in .
i mean between writer &apos;s block
and my neighbor &apos;s construction
i &apos;m going crazy here .
what &apos;s going on there ?
i just got a call . the bodies of two young women
were found in the elden street area in bristol virginia .
they were both tortured and electrocuted .
did they make any phone calls ?
yes . but without the signature .
i &apos;ll be there in 20 minutes .
is that ellie again ?
she texts me every morning on her way to school .
how &apos;s she doing ?
well she &apos;s already got herself a bff named jill
and she thinks she wants to play soccer .
she &apos;s adjusting . that &apos;s good .
bristol virginia . the body of 25 @-@ year @-@ old jenny delilly
was found yesterday .
she had been tortured sodomized and electrocuted
before being forced to make a goodbye call to her parents .
her body was then dumped off elden street .
a week ago the body of kara kirkland
was found in the same area having suffered identical injuries .
this reminds me of the butcher case .
why does that name sound familiar to me ?
the butcher was a sexual sadist that killed 20 women
in the same area of virginia from 1984 to 1993 and then vanished .
he tortured blond women in their 20s .
that lived in or near bristol .
that was one of rossi &apos;s old cases isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
does he know ?
some vacation .
did you get any sun ?
i never got any anything .
do you think the butcher &apos;s back ?
i doubt it . we profiled him as a white male
in his late 40s back then .
he &apos;d be in his 70s by now .
didn &apos;t you almost catch him ?
in the spring of &apos; 93 we narrowed the geographical profile .
we alerted every blonde in their mid @-@ 20s
in bristol and the surrounding counties .
the pressure got so intense the killings just stopped .
well the copelands killed into their 70s .
this could be him coming back .
it &apos;s probably a copycat .
if he &apos;s emulating the butcher
he could just be getting started .
marcel proust wrote
&quot; remembrance of things past is not necessarily
the remembrance of things as they were . &quot;
all right let &apos;s go over victimology .
both jenny delilly and kara kirkland were single professional women .
jenny had just gotten a job as a web designer
and kara worked for a nonprofit .
each woman was taken from a populated area with no witnesses .
jenny from a crowded drugstore parking lot
kara from the back patio of a ground @-@ floor apartment
when her roommate went inside to answer the phone .
why not take the roommate ?
she &apos;s brunette . he prefers blondes .
these vics were forced to make phone calls .
jenny left a message and kara spoke with her fiance .
garcia were you able to trace the calls ?
my pretties they &apos;re using disposable cells
so i &apos;m coming up empty .
we do have a timeline though .
according to the m.e. &apos; s report
both victims were dead for about 3 hours before they were found
which means based upon the times of their messages
they endured 5 additional hours of torture
after making their goodbye calls .
it wasn &apos;t enough that he caused his victims pain and suffering
it extended to their parents as well ?
rossi were the phone calls the butcher made his victims leave similar ?
yeah but the content varied .
13 vics left answering machine messages for loved ones
5 actually talked to someone before they died
and two reached no one .
but didn &apos;t the butcher make his victims
end their messages by saying they were enjoying it ?
that was the signature .
wouldn &apos;t that make a sadist flaccid ?
it wasn &apos;t about him .
it was about the parents .
he wanted to make sure that they knew
he had complete control and dominance over their daughters .
all right morgan and prentiss go to the m.e.
we need to compare ritual and m.o.
rossi reid and i will interview the families
and go over the messages .
rossi what &apos;s in the box ?
evil .
this isn &apos;t the butcher believe me .
we need a room with a whiteboard a window and 5 chairs .
unless the butcher &apos;s jack lalanne
this is a younger copycat .
the bodies were left in the exact same location .
everybody knew the details of this case .
the paper even printed part of the answering machine messages .
have you been able to step up police presence on elden street ?
well it &apos;s a 7 @-@ mile stretch that runs through the city .
i &apos;ve done what i could considering our budget .
are detectives clemmons benton and gallagher still here ?
they worked the first case .
clemmons and benton both died 2 years ago .
gallagher retired from the force
when his wife was killed at the pentagon on 9 / 11 .
so you &apos;re the lead detective on this ?
unfortunately . look the families of the victims
should be here any minute .
if there &apos;s anything i can do to help you guys let me know .
thank you .
you can tell from the burn wounds
that they were assaulted with an electrified object .
curling iron ? poker ?
inconclusive .
they also have numerous lacerations on their bodies .
slight ones near the throat deep ones on the chest .
multiple knives .
the guy was creative .
creatively sick .
what about the contusions on the backs of their heads ?
they were most likely sustained during the abduction .
this is a different approach than the butcher &apos;s abductions .
based on rossi &apos;s profile the butcher was a smooth @-@ talker
who lured his victims without initial physical force .
yet clearly this unsub doesn &apos;t have
the same confidence or finesse .
he &apos;s sloppy .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
hey colby .
how have you been ?
i uh i got a job at joe &apos;s coffee .
you should come by sometime .
sounds good .
i &apos;m hungry .
how &apos;s he doing ?
what am i talking to myself ?
i should go .
if i had a good caretaker he &apos;d be here on time .
i don &apos;t pay you to be late .
i &apos;m coming .
that &apos;s what you said an hour ago .
i should &apos;ve gotten rid of you when i had a chance .
the old girl would have fed me by now .
she was so scared .
i &apos;m sorry i have to ask you to do this .
mom dad this is jenny .
i &apos;m in trouble .
i kept asking her what was wrong but ...
she just made me listen .
i &apos;m in so much trouble .
i know you taught me to not be afraid
but i &apos;m so afraid .
when you get this message i &apos;ll probably be dead .
so i just wanted to tell you that ...
did your fiancee say anything
that sounded out of the ordinary ?
no .
she sounded like herself considering the circumstances .
you say that her lexical features
are consistent with her vernacular ?
are the words hers ?
yeah that &apos;s what she said .
i need to ask you about the words that jenny used .
does it sound like something that she would say ?
does she sound like herself ?
we never--we never told her to not be afraid .
why would she say that ?
she wouldn &apos;t .
at the end of the conversation
did kara ...
say that she enjoyed it ?
no she didn &apos;t say she enjoyed it .
what are you guys not telling me ?
i need some air .
what happened in there ?
we talked about the signature .
even though jenny delilly &apos;s message didn &apos;t have the whole signature
i want you to see if it matches any of
the old butcher phone transcripts .
you think something in jenny &apos;s call was scripted ?
possibly .
baldwin softball field .
good . very good .
heritage mall .
very good .
gas station off west state .
no . no try again .
it &apos;s the one off west state .
it &apos;s ok if you don &apos;t remember .
don &apos;t tell me i don &apos;t remember .
let &apos;s just try another one .
you &apos;re trying to make me look stupid . i &apos;m not stupid .
no one said you were stupid .
you just ... you gotta keep practicing .
i know a better way to practice .
it &apos;s not time .
it &apos;s time when i say it &apos;s time .
i want to go out .
take me out .
all right .
this is right where she parked her car .
and then she rushed in there to get a prescription .
then she comes back to her car .
and somebody gets her attention .
they call out to her .
she throws her stuff in the trunk
runs off that way and that &apos;s when we lose her .
so how do you snatch someone from here ?
push her into a car ?
it &apos;s way too crowded .
but there is a blind spot right there .
there &apos;s enough of an obstruction here
to park your car
blitz her from behind
and then push her into the vehicle .
but could you do that alone ?
i doubt it .
and two people would explain how the first victim
was abducted so quickly from the patio
when her roommate went in to get the phone .
it would also shed light on the m.e. &apos; s findings .
there wasn &apos;t one unsub with two knives .
it was two unsubs with their own weapon .
please tell mom i love her .
tell joey the same .
he wants me to say i enjoyed it but i didn &apos;t .
yes she did . she &apos;s dead .
he doesn &apos;t even sound human .
did you transfer all the tapes yourself ?
17 years ago he sounded like background noise
but when i digitized them
you could hear every word .
yes she did . she &apos;s dead .
it &apos;s stunningly creepy .
i never caught the butcher
but i caught his voice .
i &apos;d go to bed hearing him wake up hearing him .
it would be like hearing a message from jack the ripper .
why haven &apos;t you ever written about him ?
he had too much power . i need to find him first .
mom dad this is susan . i &apos;m in trouble .
i &apos;m in so much trouble .
i know you taught me never to be afraid
but i am so afraid .
what number was she ?
number 20 . susan cole .
his last victim .
jenny delilly &apos;s message
didn &apos;t match any old victims &apos; messages
until we get to susan cole
the butcher &apos;s last kill .
their messages were identical
minus the line about enjoying it
the butcher &apos;s signature .
the victimologies are similar too .
what did the m.e. say ?
multiple wounds from two separate knives on each victim .
there &apos;s no way jenny delilly was abducted by one person .
so two knives and two unsubs ?
he couldn &apos;t take jenny alone .
when you look at kara &apos;s patio
and the fact that the roommate went inside for two seconds
it &apos;s highly unlikely .
so what are you saying ?
we &apos;re looking for a team .
miss .
miss i need your help .
my caretaker had a heart attack .
please you gotta help me .
oh my god . where is he ?
sir--
look at her lips .
she &apos;s pretty .
don &apos;t worry .
we &apos;re gonna tell you exactly what to say .
everything &apos;s gonna end all right .
heather langley .
she lives nearby .
third body in a week .
i got additional units patrolling the area but it &apos;s too big .
the unsubs fit into the community . they go unnoticed .
this is the exact same place susan cole
the butcher &apos;s last kill was dumped .
heather &apos;s body is laid out in the same way .
arms above her head demeaning straddle .
exactly the same stab wounds .
the wounds are strategically placed
so they miss the major arteries
but inflict maximum pain .
these unsubs aren &apos;t just trying to copy the butcher .
they &apos;re trying to exactly reenact his last kill .
copycats usually start from the beginning .
why are they fixated on the last crime ?
something about this particular case is significant to them ?
morgan and prentiss contact the parents .
see if they got a phone call .
you should make the notification first .
we will . and we &apos;ll uh bring the parents down to the station .
we need to release the profile .
hotch .
the butcher is somehow involved in this .
the nuances are just too similar .
the park the hand position the body .
i think we should wait on the profile .
but there are aspects of the butcher &apos;s signature
that are not present here dave .
and there are things that
this unsub is doing the butcher never did .
you profiled him as a narcissist who worked alone .
he would never partner up .
i just have a gut feeling that it &apos;s him .
do you want to hold back the profile based on a feeling ?
these unsubs or unknown subjects
are considerably organized .
they most likely have some sort of secondary location
they use to torture the victims .
their skill level is evidenced by the high @-@ risk public nature
of their abductions .
they &apos;re able to lure their intended victims
with some kind of a ruse .
they then blitz them with overwhelming force ...
mom daddy ... he wants me to say i enjoyed it
but i didn &apos;t .
yes she did . she &apos;s dead .
i &apos;m in trouble . i &apos;m in so much trouble .
i know you taught me to never be afraid
but i am so afraid .
agent rossi has the butcher come out of hiding ?
we think that this is the work of two of his fans
and that they &apos;re going to strike again .
you &apos;re in a good mood .
wednesday was always a good day for me .
yesterday was tuesday .
she was good .
she responded right .
i upped the volts on the charger .
i think that helped .
the call went better too .
you got her to say exactly what i needed .
you &apos;ve never been so helpful .
that &apos;s not true .
name one time you helped me without being told .
when i was 10 .
oh please .
no i--i helped with the woman in the hallway .
there was never a woman in the hallway .
yes there was .
she was running and ...
i got her for you .
you remember that ? i helped out .
well how are you gonna help me today ?
uh ...
the pharmacy girl gets off at 2 : 00
the nurse &apos;s shift ends at 3 : 00
and the teacher gets out of school at 3 : 30 .
what about that girl outside the other day ?
anna our neighbor ?
she &apos;s too close .
where &apos;s her picture ?
we never took one .
no come on choose one of these girls .
they &apos;ll all be good .
dave .
i know you &apos;re not convinced about the profile .
the butcher is a part of this .
bundy stopped using his broken arm ruse .
dahmer didn &apos;t eat all of his victims .
sometimes the psychopathology changes for these guys .
i know . i still think it &apos;s a copycat .
i &apos;m not so sure .
then if you feel this strongly
you should continue to explore the butcher as a suspect
and the rest of the team will investigate the possibility
of the relationship between the two copycats .
thanks .
the yoshim dual knife is the best on the market .
its serrated blade allows you to cut through anything .
and the handle is dishwasher safe .
if you buy one today
you will also get our yoshim two @-@ pronged carving fork ...
i love her hands .
i &apos;ll be here next friday so you can pick one up then too .
she &apos;s got pretty hands .
this is what it is .
a father @-@ son partnership ?
wait an older alpha with a younger submissive ?
it &apos;s very rare for sexual sadism to be an inherited trait .
that &apos;s why we ruled it out .
what if he created his partner and groomed him ?
he would be in complete control and have his trust .
it would explain how the butcher is able to abduct women .
he &apos;s older appears harmless
but his son lies in wait .
the butcher has a child . i never profiled that .
i just got a call from heather langley &apos;s father .
turns out he did get a message .
he said he &apos;d checked his phone .
no one thought to check mr . langley &apos;s job .
his secretary pulled the voicemail .
she can play it for us .
let &apos;s hear it .
go ahead please .
mom dad this is heather .
when you get this message
i &apos;ll probably be dead .
tomorrow you &apos;re going to find me
and when you do please know that i ...
i enjoyed it .
i enjoyed it . that &apos;s his signature .
it &apos;s him .
i &apos;m not saying this .
say it .
you gotta stick to the script .
i won &apos;t !
she &apos;s ruining it !
if you &apos;d just brought me annie
none of this would &apos;ve happened .
dad please .
please my ass .
you can &apos;t get anything right .
you can &apos;t get the house right my food right
you can &apos;t get the kill right .
i &apos;ll show you how to kill . i &apos;ll show you how to kill !
i &apos;ll show you how to kill .
agent rossi
uh i need to give the press a statement .
not yet .
word &apos;s already leaked out
that this is the butcher and his son .
well fix your faucet and tell your men to be quiet .
look people are scared .
this guy &apos;s spent a decade terrorizing this area--
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
we need to figure out why he &apos;s back
like btk or the grim sleeper .
let &apos;s go over victimology one more time .
he kills blondes who are living on their own .
he takes them from public places with some form of ruse .
he &apos;s reenacting his last kill . for what reason ?
maybe there &apos;s something symbolic about the last kill .
let &apos;s hear her call again .
hey guys maybe we should take a look at the victims
that didn &apos;t call anybody .
there were 13 recording messages and 5 documented
conversations with loved ones .
so what ?
so there were 20 kills . two victims didn &apos;t call anyone .
i just assumed those victims couldn &apos;t reach anyone .
let &apos;s pull the files of the victims that didn &apos;t leave a message .
reid might be onto something .
what are you doing ?
what &apos;s it look like ?
i &apos;m hungry .
and my stories aren &apos;t on .
10 minutes and i &apos;ll be in .
i want to go hunt .
no dad . we &apos;re not hunting today .
why not ?
we need to lay low .
i mean there &apos;s cops all over the neighborhood .
we &apos;ll start up again next week ok ?
i don &apos;t want to wait .
it &apos;s been 3 damn weeks since we &apos;ve been hunting .
dad we hunted yesterday .
no we didn &apos;t .
yeah we did . look in there .
i didn &apos;t do that .
yeah you did .
no i didn &apos;t .
you &apos;ve been hunting without me .
why would i hunt without you ?
what &apos;s her name ?
shelly something .
we got her at the pharmacy .
i didn &apos;t do that .
she was selling knives .
why would i do that ? i got knives .
she wouldn &apos;t say the words .
that &apos;s not my work .
i don &apos;t do work like that .
dad it &apos;s ok if you don &apos;t remember .
dad this is normal .
this ain &apos;t normal .
if i &apos;m doing work like that
then you need to kill me .
just kill me !
so sylvia marks was the butcher &apos;s first kill .
karen bachner was his eighth .
so why weren &apos;t they forced to make phone calls ?
sylvia was his first kill .
he was building up his confidence .
then he thinks to himself how can i hurt the most people ?
i &apos;ll have them make calls .
and then 6 women after that made phone calls .
why did he stop at karen ?
garcia what are karen bachner &apos;s parents &apos; names ?
george and claire bachner
died in a car accident when karen was 19 .
but my notes say karen had a husband named lee mullens .
but he didn &apos;t receive a call .
when i interviewed him at the station
he said he didn &apos;t have an answering machine .
do they have a child ?
uh negative .
wait a minute .
they had a son . i wrote it down . colby .
garcia run karen &apos;s maiden name .
bachner .
oh--there it is sir . you are totally right .
karen had a son colby bachner
born at johnson memorial in bristol virginia .
was the father there to sign the birth certificate ?
yes . his name was ...
lee mullens .
oh . karen had colby
2 years before her and lee were married .
are the father or son still in the area ?
yeah . lee mullens and colby bachner
live at 1844 shadow wood lane
which is 6 miles from where the victims were dumped .
so maybe karen bachner never made a call
because the most important person in her life
was already in the room with her--her son .
oh hells no .
they &apos;re licensed electricians .
let &apos;s go .
dad ?
we should talk .
fine . we can go hunt today .
i &apos;ll go pick someone up
and then i &apos;ll come and get you .
i &apos;m gonna get you someone that &apos;ll make you really happy .
i &apos;ll come by and pick you up when i got her .
ok ?
i wrote down where i &apos;m going .
and you &apos;re all set .
thank you so much . have a good day .
ready for that coffee ?
yeah .
fbi . don &apos;t move .
put your hands in the air .
what are you doing here ?
sir move slowly down the stairs .
why are you here ?
my son isn &apos;t here .
you &apos;re under arrest for the murders
of chloe moore reilly gold and sylvia marks .
i don &apos;t know them .
please i need to call someone .
you can call from the station .
rossi wait .
i &apos;m done waiting .
dave--
we checked the house . there &apos;s no torture chamber no son .
there &apos;s a fresh grave in the backyard
and the son colby left a note saying
he was going to find a prize .
garcia check mullens &apos; records
and see if he owns any other property .
check under the son &apos;s name
employment records anything you can find .
got it .
hey guys .
i think i found something .
morgan let &apos;s get all the police cars
out of the neighborhood in case the son comes back .
everything in the house is labeled--
drawers the refrigerator . i found donepezil and flashcards
in the medicine cabinet .
donepezil ? alzheimer &apos;s ?
it &apos;s a cholinesterase inhibitor . it improves acetylcholine
either by increasing levels in
the brain or enhancing nerve cells &apos; response to it .
so this guy gets to forgot
while the family has to live with this forever .
alzheimer &apos;s affects short @-@ term memory
before it affects long @-@ term .
that it explains the scripted phone calls and the dump sites .
it also explains why he started up again .
he &apos;s repeating his last kill because he can &apos;t remember it .
he killed over a 10 @-@ year period .
he probably remembers the earliest victims .
what did you find ?
he &apos;s got slides of all the prior abduction sites .
you want me to go in with you ?
i &apos;ve got this .
we met 20 years ago .
do you remember that mullens ?
i &apos;d like a soda with lemon thank you .
you played the grieving husband .
i was a young fbi agent .
do you remember these women ?
i don &apos;t know them .
of course you do . you wouldn &apos;t have forgotten them yet .
so tell me
where is your son mullens ?
where is he taking your next victim ?
to a friend &apos;s place ? to an abandoned house ?
i rewired this house .
did he help you with that ?
or did you do that on your own ?
like you did ...
all of these .
those your trophies ?
what do you know about trophies ?
i like trophies .
it proves you won something .
well you &apos;re not gonna win today .
i &apos;m scared .
you don &apos;t have a right to be scared .
those women were scared .
now where &apos;s your son ?
please colby stop .
stop talking .
why are you doing this to me ?
please why are you doing this to me ?
please stop talking !
please just let me go . i won &apos;t tell them .
shut up . shut up .
shut up !
it must be hard to lose your mind .
i wouldn &apos;t know .
you start forgetting how to feed yourself .
soon you &apos;re stinking up your pants
wearing diapers .
i ain &apos;t wearing no diaper .
you peed into your boxers 2 minutes ago .
you need them now .
so ...
how did you get your son
to do all this ?
did you get him to help you to kill your wife ?
karen left us .
no no no no .
that &apos;s what you convinced him .
but you killed her when she figured you out .
you took her to a chamber
the same place you took heather langley
kara kirkland
sylvia marks .
sylvia &apos;s a pretty name .
she graduated from georgetown .
she wanted to be a chemist .
but you burned her so bad
her family couldn &apos;t recognize her .
how did you do that ?
did you use a fire poker or a curling iron ?
something you made ? something you bought ?
when she saw the lexwell her eyes went so wide
she scared me half to death .
find out what that is .
lexwell is a camera manufacturer
based out of new york . they &apos;ve been around since the forties .
have they always produced photography equipment ?
uh back in the day
they made electroshock therapy equipment .
unknown object penetrating our victims .
garcia what mental hospitals in virginia use ect machines ?
5 hospitals use lexwell equipment .
of those 5.3 have been torn down
2 are still in operation .
ok cross @-@ check that list of hospitals
against mullens &apos; electrical business client list .
yeah i &apos;m already doing that .
mullens wired some buildings
at the oakton center back in the eighties .
you know that place ?
it &apos;s a former mental institution .
yeah on 86 acres . two of the buildings are still in operation .
the rest of the place is abandoned .
thanks baby girl .
hotch we know where the kid is .
where are you going ?
colby .
put down the knife .
i &apos;ll kill her .
the killing is done .
please help me .
this is not your fault colby .
your father got you into this .
no no . you don &apos;t know my dad .
we know you &apos;re losing him colby .
this isn &apos;t gonna help .
he &apos;s getting better .
no . he isn &apos;t .
and i know that scares you
because you already lost your mother .
she left us !
your father killed her .
no .
no no . no you &apos;re wrong .
you were 10 .
he strapped her to this table .
my mom went to boston to live with her sister .
your father brought her here .
you were probably in the car .
you blocked it out .
think back .
he most likely knocked her out at home
and brought her here .
the--the only woman we brought here from the house
i helped him with .
and that was your mother colby .
no ...
she--she left us .
every one of your father &apos;s victims
made a call
except for your mother .
because she laid on this table
and said goodbye to you right here .
this wasn &apos;t your fault colby .
mommy loves you .
she--she ...
she &apos;s not dead .
she ... she left us .
she--she ...
she left us !
you don &apos;t want to hurt her son .
you know parents are supposed to protect their children .
well sometimes they don &apos;t get the memo .
oh please don &apos;t tell me that &apos;s ellie again .
she just wants me to say good night .
trust me prentiss i get it .
but i &apos;m the first person she wants to speak to in the morning .
she won &apos;t go to bed unless she talks to me at night .
the girl &apos;s got ptsd . she &apos;s gotta vent to someone .
a professional .
or someone who &apos;s been there .
