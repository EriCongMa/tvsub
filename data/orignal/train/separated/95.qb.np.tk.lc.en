they all wanted to join ; they &apos;re all good .
i agree .

no . robyn .
why not kalinda ?
money .
are you okay with that ?
yeah .
just kind of weird .
everything &apos;s ending .
beginning too .
so ...
how are we gonna tell them ?
who ?
will and diane .
oh , it &apos;s the circle of life .
they had to leave their old law firms
to start lockhart / gardner .
i have the death row appeal on thursday .
i will tell them after that .
we have to get some office space anyway .
unless you want to take the sweeney offer ?
no .
congratulations ,
mrs. first lady .
i forgot .
what time is it ?
it &apos;s been two hours and ten minutes .
is that normal ?
no .
is that one of the moms ?
mrs. henning .
god , she must hate us .
i will now read the warrant .
&quot; whereas eddie alan fornum ,
&quot; on the 26th of may , 1999,
&quot; murdered both lynn gore and susan henning ,
&quot; and whereas eddie alan fornum ... &quot;
... &quot; and whereas
&quot; eddie alan fornum was adjudicated guilty of two counts
&quot; of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death ,
&quot; we will now carry out the sentence &quot;
mr. fornum , do you have any last words ?
i &apos;m sorry to everyone here .
to my new lawyers ,
diane and alicia ,
i have a favor to ask of you both .
please ...
... if you could ...
go see my mom .
i was her only son ,
and i was a disappointment .
to the parents
of miss henning and miss gore ,
i am sorry
what happened to your daughters ,
but i did not do this .
and i wish ...
i wish i could say what was happening
here tonight was just ,
because that might bring you some ...
because that might make ...
they &apos;re having trouble finding a line .
ma &apos;am , please sit down .
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m gonna need you to sit down right now .
i want to talk to the warden .
ma &apos;am , i need you to sit down right now .
you got to go and sit down right now . let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go .
warden ?
excuse me , go back to your seat .
warden barkin , i need to speak with you !
all right , let &apos;s go .
warden barkin !
we &apos;re eddie &apos;s lawyers , you can &apos;t just ...
yes , we can and we will .
wait .
sir , this is an eighth amendment violation .
lower your voice ,
miss lockhart .
i know , we &apos;re all tense .
our two medical technicians are having trouble
finding a suitable vein .
but that is all .
mr. fornum was an intravenous drug user ,
and many of his veins have collapsed .
you have been trying for two hours and 20 minutes
to find a vein ?
yes , but we &apos;re now attempting to run a line in his foot .
this is torture , this is the definition of torture .
that &apos;s not for you to say , ma &apos;am .
that &apos;s right . it &apos;s for the court .
broom v. strickland .
this execution is a direct violation
of eighth amendment protections ,
and it should be delayed
until you can ensure its proper administration .
hi , could you open the door for me ?
uh ... sure .
hi , i &apos;m monica in litigation .
i &apos;m teleconferencing from home .
okay , settle down , everybody .
just got out of court .
we need to pursue an evidentiary path to an appeal .
clearly it &apos;s a long shot ...
just shut the door on it .
alicia just got here .
good . she has the legal aid work .
they want us to take point on the appeal .
and when is the execution now ?
saturday , midnight .
it &apos;s been delayed 48 hours .
look , it &apos;s a second chance .
that &apos;s all we need . robyn , take us through .
eddie alan fornum was arrested in july , 1999,
for murdering two 17 @-@ year @-@ old girls outside of a movie theater
in south bend after a botched carjacking .
eddie had an alibi , but he was found
in possession of one of the girls &apos; necklaces .
which he bought at a flea market .
and his hair was found on the body .
that &apos;s where we want to focus our appeal .
we don &apos;t think it &apos;s eddie &apos;s hair on the body ,
and we &apos;re subpoenaing the forensic lab to retest it .
what about the snitch ?
he &apos;s the real reason that eddie was convicted .
he died six years ago .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;d find much there .
okay , so we &apos;ll break up into groups .
tonya , you work the team on witnesses and testimony .
carey , the forensics .
robyn , the background of the experts .
thanks , monica .
good point .
am i really needed here or can i go ?
we have 48 hours .
let &apos;s make them count . cary , hold on a minute .
uh , me ?
no , cary @-@ cary .
diane , that &apos;s not enough time , is it ?
to get a subpoena on the hair and test it , no .
okay , you work your evidentiary track ,
and i &apos;ll grab cary and alicia
and we &apos;ll try to buy you more time .
how ?
i have no idea .
diane ?
yes ?
i was getting ...
excuse me .
i was getting a subpoena to retest the hair .
yes ?
someone already retested it
in the prosecutor &apos;s office six years ago .
right , for an appeal .
no , not in the office in indiana ,
the one here in chicago .
someone tested it here .
why ?
your dad knows barry scheck ?
yeah , he did . why ?
he &apos;s in federal court on an eighth amendment
class action right now .
call him .
hey , cary , what &apos;s up ?
barry ... mr. scheck ,
we need some help on the eddie alan fornum appeal .
oh , i heard his execution was delayed .
what do you need ?
we were hoping to contribute to your class action .
well , i don &apos;t know
if the judge is gonna let him join this far along .
i know , we don &apos;t want to join .
hey , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re coming with us .
oh , hey , uh , cary told me the good news .
can i tell the clients ?
what ?
the governor &apos;s wife is joining our new firm .
it &apos;s a selling point .
no , please don &apos;t .
well , that &apos;s not what i said .
get rid of those , and let &apos;s talk .
get out of my way !
here &apos;s what i need .
all the phone numbers called by the fourth @-@ year associates
over the last three months .
why ?
i think the fourth @-@ years are intending to leave
and take some of our clients with them .
why do you think that ?
because i &apos;m psychic .
well , i can &apos;t legally access their calls .
they &apos;re using the company cell phones .
they &apos;re not their phones , they &apos;re ours .
just get me the metadata .
i want to see who they &apos;re calling .
eli , i &apos;m on a death row appeal , i don &apos;t have time .
i know , but this is important .
eli , did you just hear me ?
i said , &quot; death row appeal . &quot;
oh , i thought that was hyperbole .
uh , but you agreed to 4 : 00 .
we &apos;ve already delayed twice .
where &apos;s the hair testimony ?
eli ...
look , any time after saturday i can do this , not today .
okay , sunday at noon ?
at 7 : 00 . what is it again ?
it &apos;s the basic ethics talk for the governor @-@ elect &apos;s family .
okay , we &apos;re changing strategies .
got to go , eli .
peter ?
mr. gold ?
i &apos;m marilyn garbanza ,
executive director of the illinois ethics commission .
we have a 4 : 00 .
actually , i have a 4 : 00
with a mitch garbanza .
yes , that &apos;s me .
governor quinn used to call me mitch .
why ?
i have no idea .
okay .
um , mrs. florrick ,
unfortunately , has to reschedule
for sunday at 7 : 00 , if that &apos;s all right .
that is all right . thank you .
i &apos;ll see you then .
yeah , that sounds about right .
the choice isn &apos;t actionable , i want to be clear .
i know , you &apos;re just raising a red flag .
what are we discussing here ?
eli , you &apos;ve met marilyn ?
just a few seconds ago in your office .
marilyn has some concerns about mickey .
our chief of staff ?
oh , i didn &apos;t know he was chosen yet .
he hasn &apos;t been yet , but he is our top choice .
so marilyn &apos;s concerned that mickey
hired you as a crisis counselor .
it could look like a conflict of interest .
because i ran the search committee ?
yes .
again , i &apos;m not here to say you can &apos;t hire him .
i don &apos;t have that power .
i &apos;m just saying it could look ethically compromised .
okay , we &apos;ll look into it . thanks .
okay .
thank you , marilyn .
she &apos;s doing her job , eli .
currently , indiana protocols ...
... has insufficient protections built in that guarantee ...
... a painless execution ...
the printer , the mobile printer .
okay , i &apos;ll go get it .
new innovation ?
test program .
so how does it feel
to be first lady of illinois ?
weird .
kind of like ... first galactic princess .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t get back to you the other night .
hey , you &apos;ve been celebrating ,
you &apos;ve been on death row , it &apos;s been ...
a weird few days .
but we can talk ...
when this is over . don &apos;t worry .
well , i ... i was hoping to ...
all right , i got it .
asa pine .
ms. lockhart .
hello .
you worked at the south bend
prosecutor &apos;s office , didn &apos;t you ?
a while ago .
why ? do we know someone ... ?
you were the assistant prosecutor
on the eddie fornum homicide .
do you know how we know that ?
i don &apos;t care .
you had eddie &apos;s hair retested six years ago .
ms. lockhart , i &apos;m not talking to you .
they &apos;re going to execute him .
they tried once
and they &apos;re going to execute him in 48 hours .
and you had ten years to appeal his execution .
don &apos;t come to me with 40 hours left .
you think he &apos;s innocent .
i think you &apos;re out of time .
just give us the hair test .
will , i have a lead , but i need time .
that is a very good point , your honor .
that wasn &apos;t a point , mr. scheck .
i just wanted you to finish .
well , uh , let me address that point , if i may ...
uh , but before i do ,
let me introduce my co @-@ counsel ...
will gardner .
... will gardner , joining the case .
your honor , if it pleases the court ,
we ask that the execution of eddie alan fornum
be delayed until ...
your honor ...
i &apos;m way , way ahead of you , ms. cesca .
you know , it doesn &apos;t please the court .
not very much pleases the court these days .
but your guy is not gonna join this suit .
now , what else do you have ?
you misunderstand me , your honor .
we &apos;re not looking for eddie alan fornum to join the suit .
we &apos;re looking for him to be the evidence .
mr. fornum &apos;s testimony
is the most relevant as to how much pain is suffered in the subject of lethal injection
because he was the subject of lethal injection .
your honor , i am speechless .
me , too .
i am speechless .
and yet intrigued . go on .
if mr. fornum is executed ,
the state will have destroyed crucial evidence for the plaintiff .
your honor , they are trying to delay an execution .
of course they are .
how much time do you need to depose him ?
six weeks .
a month .
three days .
all right .
you have till monday .
your honor ...
just relax , all right ?
the state of indiana can execute him on tuesday .
now , look , i know what you three are doing ,
but y @-@ you &apos;re not gonna save your guy with schemes .
you &apos;re gonna buy him a little time .
you &apos;re not gonna save him .
time is all we need , your honor .
and please use it well .
get on with kalinda .
we bought her another 48 hours .
governor @-@ elect florrick &apos;s office . please hold .
you &apos;re sure you don &apos;t need anything ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure . thanks .
i &apos;m fine , thanks .
four of the last eight governors of illinois
have gone to prison .
four of the last eight .
which is why we need to remember
that the spouse and the children
are an extension of the governor .
your choices become his choices .
now , i &apos;ve looked over your work at lockhart / gardner , alicia .
there shouldn &apos;t be any problem there ,
as long as you don &apos;t actively solicit clients
who have business with the governor &apos;s office ,
and that your relationship with the governor
isn &apos;t used as a lure to clients .
it should not look like peter is receiving
backdoor remuneration through your business .
and that your clients shouldn &apos;t believe
that your spousal connection ...
we need to talk .
about ?
we need to talk .
i &apos;m starting my own firm .
you &apos;re ...
when ?
next week .
me , cary and ten others .
peter , i wanted to tell you yesterday ,
but there was just no time .
that &apos;s fantastic !
you &apos;ve been wanting to do this since law school .
i know . but i &apos;m just worried that ...
it might complicate your ethical issues .
oh , marilyn was covering
all the spousal conflict of interest issues .
have you told will ?
and diane ?
no . not yet .
uh , just you two .
i &apos;m damn proud of you .
damn proud of you .
thank you .
i &apos;m so sorry , i have to get this .
i am on my way .
what ?
there were two nurses , a man and a woman .
and they had the needles .
and they tried to put them
into the veins of my right and my left arm .
how many times ?
i again object to this line of questioning
as a delaying tactic .
do you want to get the judge on the line ?
what , and delay this even more ?
go ahead , eddie .
well , then another nurse came on--
a head one , i guess--
and he tried again on this arm ,
but something really hurt .
can you show us where on your arms ?
objection .
good , let &apos;s get the judge .
i &apos;m preserving my objection for the record .
go on , eddie .
no , i &apos;ll do it .
so , after that ,
they went to your neck ?
yeah .
i guess there was a lot blood , because ...
i heard the guy say &quot; oops &quot; &quot;
and the female nurse had to leave the room .
why did she have to leave the room ?
i don &apos;t know , but she was crying .
do you remember her name ?
&quot; joan , &quot; your honor .
that &apos;s all we know .
but i &apos;m sure the ausa can locate her .
your honor , the identity of nurses
at indiana state is kept confidential
so that it doesn &apos;t become known
that they participated in an execution .
yes , but that doesn &apos;t shield them from questioning .
we would assert that it does .
really ? you &apos;re asserting some kind
of immunity , ms. cesca ?
your honor , we need to have a hearing on this question .
hold on , hold on .
ms. cesca , any thoughts about walking that one back ?
we apologize , your honor .
we agree there would be no immunity ,
but mr. gardner is merely using
this deposition as a ploy .
your honor !
and he will insist that mr. fornum be kept alive
for his rebuttal testimony .
no .
no .
i was merely going to insist
that the ausa is trying to destroy evidence
by expediting this execution .
no , no , no .
i &apos;m not gonna delay this execution any longer .
how soon can you have that nurse available ?
tomorrow afternoon .
that &apos;s not nearly enough time !
it &apos;ll be too late then ...
shut up .
tomorrow afternoon
after mr. fornum &apos;s been executed ?
well , that &apos;s just coincidence .
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
make her available this afternoon
for a supervised deposition or be held in contempt .
how did you get back here ?
i needed to use the bathroom .
call security !
you quit indiana a month
after convicting fornum .
you know something is wrong with this case .
you know he &apos;s innocent .
he &apos;s not innocent .
you retested the hair evidence .
why would you do that unless ...
because i thought i was wrong .
i wasn &apos;t .
the test came back consistent
with fornum &apos;s hair .
i don &apos;t believe you .
last page .
there .
that doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s his hair .
you &apos;re right .
but it does mean there &apos;s no convincing you .
why did you do it six years ago ?
excuse me ?
why did you
double @-@ check the hair evidence six years ago ?
what do you mean ?
well , the date of this report
is one week after the snitch , tommy diehause , died .
you thought he might be lying ?
i don &apos;t have time ...
no , eddie fornum doesn &apos;t have time .
he escaped execution once ; he won &apos;t a second time .
this is the moment to come forward , ms. pine .
please .
you called security ?
it &apos;s all right .
i was using diehause on another case .
he snitched on a top drug dealer
in exchange for his freedom ...
and a new identity .
will , the snitch is still alive .
he &apos;s using the alias ...
robbie walker .
kalinda , we have a lead .
we think he &apos;s still in the illinois area .
forget the hair . it &apos;s a dead end .
it &apos;s the snitch .
but we need more time to find him .
robbie walker , aka tommy diehause .
what &apos;d you find out ?
the snitch is still alive , but we &apos;re having ...
no , about the fourth @-@ year phone calls .
do you want me in this meeting ?
dear god . go away !
i haven &apos;t looked into the calls yet .
yes , you have .
i checked with our provider .
they said they sent you the records .
then why do you need me ? maybe i don &apos;t .
here &apos;s another question for you :
why aren &apos;t you doing your job ?
you have a complaint , you go to will or diane .
is this about cary ?
or are you thinking of leaving with them ?
david , you should leave investigating
to the professionals .
you might hurt yourself .
okay ! save that photo ,
because it &apos;s the last time you &apos;re gonna see
the ethics committee smiling in my presence .
thank you , governor @-@ elect .
maybe we can talk later .
not until you call me &quot; peter . &quot;
we should replace her .
why ?
because the optics aren &apos;t good .
what optics ?
her ... looks .
don &apos;t be ridiculous , eli .
i &apos;m serious .
i can &apos;t fire someone because they &apos;re too pretty .
then don &apos;t . promote her .
move her laterally .
you don &apos;t want sex to be an issue here .
it &apos;s not an issue .
not for you , but for your enemies .
they &apos;d be delighted to crown a new bimbo .
she &apos;s not a bimbo .
and we don &apos;t do that .
we don &apos;t fire someone because of the way they look .
ok .
it was my first execution .
in fact ,
you &apos;re not really a medically @-@ trained nurse ,
is that correct , joan ?
well , i have training ...
yes , but due to the hippocratic oath ,
保证遵守医生道德守则的誓言 &#93;
trained nurses and doctors
are not allowed to participate in executions .
attorney is testifying , your honor .
yes , at some length .
sustained .
joan , did you leave
the execution prep in tears ?
well , i was upset .
eddie said you left in tears .
do you disagree with that ?
no . he &apos;s right .
he said it was because of
the blood spilling from his neck after a faulty iv line .
that sounds right .
i left because of the blood .
joan , did the prosecution prepare you for this testimony
by telling you to agree with everything i said ?
objection , your honor .
no , no . overruled .
please answer .
she didn &apos;t say &quot; agree with everything , &quot;
but she did say you were trying to create disagreement
between fornum and me
so that fornum would have to be kept alive as a rebuttal witness .
so you are actively deceiving this court ?
no .
i &apos;m just not seeing any area of disagreement .
do you believe mr. fornum was tortured ?
i think the offender was in pain .
he tried to keep from crying and screaming out .
i think ...
yes , it was torture .
and don &apos;t you think
this is a systematic problem of lethal injection ?
i don &apos;t think so .
it was his veins .
we &apos;ve never had this problem before .
eddie &apos;s veins ?
what do you mean ?
he has what we call
rolling veins ...
objection !
your honor , we insist that a physical
of eddie alan fornum be conducted .
oh , dear god . your honor ...
the witness has made
an assertion that mr. fornum is
an exception due to his rolling veins .
well , we need a physical
to see if he is in fact an exception .
this is game @-@ playing .
i don &apos;t know how it &apos;s game @-@ playing ...
all the appeals have all been exhausted .
it &apos;s absolutely ridiculous .
the only game @-@ playing is ...
i don &apos;t want to shout over you guys . sit down .
sit down .
good .
how long will it take to do this physical ?
that was good .
no , you were good .
okay .
kalinda , the court &apos;s delayed a few days .
diane , yeah , we got our reprieve .
yeah .
yes , i &apos;m serious .
are you serious ?
dude , totally serious .
stiles said he hooked up with her after second period .
hey , what &apos;s up with your sister ?
what do you mean ?
when did she start looking so hot ?
what are you talking about ?
oh , you probably haven &apos;t seen it .
seen what ?
turbochap.com. stiles sent me the link .
hello .
zach , it &apos;s mom . what are you doing ?
what am i doing ? nothing . homework . why ?
nothing , i just ...
i need you to get your sister dinner tonight .
hey , is that mom ?
uh , yeah .
can you just tell her we need more juice ?
we need more juice .
and i love you , too .
i &apos;ll be home around 11 : 00 or so .
not too much tv .
okay . bye .
bye .
alicia .
what &apos;s going on ?
west side story ?
里面经常有两个少年流氓集团聚集的场景
we have a possibility on some office space .
just outside the loop on harrison .
$ 20 a square foot .
good .
it doesn &apos;t become available for three weeks .
okay , so we rent temporary offices in the meantime .
no .
we were , uh , wondering whether we should stick around until then .
for three weeks ? why ?
chumhum needs some work on a case .
so , we do it from our new office .
look , we can &apos;t keep skulking around .
we have to cut the cord at some point .
i agree .
we need to get going .
tell her the real reason .
people want to wait for bonuses .
oh , come on !
it &apos;s $ 1 million between us .
if we walk out before the first of the month ,
they &apos;ll never pay us .
a lot of us are counting on
that money for start @-@ up costs .
we can &apos;t keep fooling the partners .
we can &apos;t keep fooling will .
do we have a problem ?
no . but you were all right waiting a week to leave
after your case was finished ,
but you &apos;re not all right when it &apos;s our issue ?
it &apos;s a death row case .
okay , let &apos;s not make it a big issue .
listen , the difference here is two weeks .
let &apos;s just put it up to a vote to the others , okay ?
hey , tommy .
who are you ?
kalinda .
robyn .
i don &apos;t know who you guys are looking for .
my name isn &apos;t tommy .
it is .
tommy diehause .
sad . you win a whole new identity ,
but you still can &apos;t resist being a thief .
look , i don &apos;t know how you guys found me ,
but i told the truth at eddie &apos;s trial .
he killed those girls .
he was only trying to jack their car ,
but they fought him and pulled off his ski mask ,
and that &apos;s why he had to kill them .
come on , tommy , why would anyone confess to you ?
you have snitch written all over you .
yeah .
but how &apos;d i know about the ski mask
if eddie didn &apos;t tell me , huh ?
the police never told anyone about that little detail .
maybe you heard it from the real killer .
i did hear it from the real killer :
your client .
alicia , alicia .
kalinda found the snitch ,
but he &apos;s sticking to his story .
damn . does she believe him ?
no . she thinks there might be
another way to get him , though .
are you okay ?
the parking garage meet ?
sure . we &apos;re fine .
hello ?
can someone help me , please ?
i can &apos;t see anything .
is anyone around ?
thank you .
alicia .
do you have a minute ?
sure .
what &apos;s wrong ?
we looked into the company &apos;s phones .
over the past month ,
the fourth @-@ year associates have called
our top clients a dozen times each .
we &apos;re worried they &apos;re thinking of leaving with them .
do you have any insight ?
no .
we called the clients , but they &apos;re being tight @-@ lipped ,
said they have no plans of leaving at the present time .
which is known as &quot; preserving their options &quot; &quot;
i say we move past metadata
and access their texts .
can we do that ?
where &apos;s kalinda ?
kalinda &apos;s sympathetic with them .
yes , we can do that . they &apos;re our phones .
we own the texts .
alicia , you &apos;re friends with cary .
are you hearing anything at all ?
no . not since the fourth @-@ years tried to scare us .
it would be helpful if you could get closer to them .
find out if they &apos;re happy ,
and whether we should be worried .
sure .
okay , here &apos;s my problem :
i have two medical reports conducted by
two different doctors--
one for the plaintiff , one for the defense--
and surprisingly , they tell two different stories .
your honor , may i suggest ...
that mr. fornum be preserved as a rebuttal witness ?
your honor , we withdraw
our medical report on the offender &apos;s physical condition
and stipulate to the truth of the plaintiff &apos;s report .
excuse me ?
in addition , we stipulate
to everything testified in mr. fornum &apos;s deposition .
so let me get this straight .
you &apos;ve decided that it &apos;s better to execute
mr. fornum than to win your lawsuit ?
we also have the warden
from the indiana state prison who will swear to changes
in the lethal injection protocol so as to reduce the pain
associated therewith .
i imagine , mr. gardner ,
you would like to depose said warden ?
definitely , your honor .
either way ,
there &apos;s no reason to delay this execution anymore .
if you so stipulate , i suppose that &apos;s true .
ms. lockhart ?
eddie didn &apos;t do it .
i agree .
how do we prove it ?
the snitch testified about the ski mask ,
something he could only know from the killer , right ?
but when i was at treasury , we looked into prison brokers .
prison ... ?
brokers .
they &apos;re police insiders who sell information to prisoners
so that they can snitch on their cell mates in exchange
for a lighter sentence .
you think diehause got the ski mask information from a broker ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
but he &apos;ll just deny it .
if we go to him .
but what if we go after the broker ?
tommy diehause snitched for our office three times .
so we want to find someone on all three cases .
yeah , like a police officer , forensic investigator .
good luck .
you &apos;re not gonna help us ?
sir ?
why do you think alicia &apos;s leaving lockhart / gardner ?
why do i think ?
because she wants to make something of herself .
not about will ?
well , i @-@ i wouldn &apos;t presume .
and , uh ...
you think the optics are wrong with marilyn ?
yes .
photos of you with her would give the wrong impression .
okay .
promote her .
no . no cops in common ,
no forensic investigators , nothing .
we &apos;re still looking .
okay .
the execution is on for tonight .
who typed up your crime report ?
what ?
who was the clerk on your crime report ?
bottom of the page , there .
the typist .
thank you , so much , ms. munn ,
for coming in on such short notice .
oh , no problem , but i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not sure how i can help .
i just type .
i don &apos;t actually catch the bad guys .
actually , uh , we want to help you .
really ? how do you want to do that ?
we want to keep you out of jail .
we discovered your brother works as a prison guard ,
and that &apos;s how you sell information to snitches .
we are meeting next with tommy diehause ,
and one of you is gonna turn on the other .
that &apos;s the problem with working with
a snitch , ms. munn : they like to snitch .
so i would start talking first .
what do you want ?
did stiles talk to you yesterday at school ?
what ? drew stiles ?
yeah . why ?
what &apos;d he say ?
nothing . he &apos;s disgusting .
i know . what &apos;d he say ?
did you say something to your friends ?
no . why ?
they &apos;re all trying to talk to me now .
what are you doing ?
what is this ?
kids , hurry up ! your ride &apos;s here !
can we talk ?
uh , my mistake .
i have to get to work .
you were in with the partners yesterday .
what did they say ?
nothing .
alicia .
we need to leave by the end of the week .
they said that ?
no , i &apos;m saying it .
i &apos;m still a partner here .
and i &apos;m stuck in the middle .
i have a fiduciary responsibility
to lockhart / gardner .
and i am opening myself up to a lawsuit
just by talking to you about anything .
we need to leave .
look .
one of the things we said we didn &apos;t like
about lockhart / gardner was how decisions were made
by fiat , by will and diane .
we said we wanted to run things democratically .
and we all voted to wait three weeks .
would we take this case ?
this death row case .
i don &apos;t know .
probably . why not ?
it &apos;s pro bono .
50 partner hours .
we would be afraid of going broke .
yeah , but lockhart / gardner
didn &apos;t take death row cases
until its sixth or seventh year .
are you having second thoughts ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like watching diane and will work .
they care .
alicia .
you and i are the new will and diane .
don &apos;t use the company phones .
they &apos;re accessing the data .
i have a deposition .
very simply , the medical team thought
they could put an i.v. in the offender &apos;s arm ,
but they were wrong .
and how will tonight &apos;s execution be different ?
we will do a better job hydrating mr. fornum
and using warm compresses to raise his veins .
and we will place the i.v. in his foot .
and you didn &apos;t do this the last time ?
we would &apos;ve .
but the execution was halted .
and i didn &apos;t supervise it .
so , you weren &apos;t present during the last attempt ?
not all the time .
we had a late arrival of potassium chloride .
we &apos;ve had difficulties with the supply of this drug in the past ,
so i supervised and witnessed its removal from an overnight pouch
and placement in the intravenous tubing .
however , we will have greater control ...
what ?
this court seems to be all eddie alan fornum all the time .
yes , his honor manfreddi
referred this death row appeal to your court ,
your honor ,
given that you were already hearing
the eighth amendment appeal .
lucky me . all right .
so you &apos;re ten hours away from an execution .
what do you have for me ?
we &apos;d like to call a witness .
you testified at edward alan fornum &apos;s trial ?
yes .
and you testified that he confessed to the double murder ?
yes .
and you would like to now withdraw that testimony ?
yes .
as far as you know , eddie fornum is innocent ?
yes .
and you received the information to condemn him
from the brother of that woman there--
leslie munn ?
yes .
is there anything else you would like to say ?
no .
you know , i didn &apos;t plan on judging this appeal ,
but you bring me that snitch
who changes his testimony after almost a decade ?
now ... now i &apos;m sorry , ms . lockhart , i &apos;m sorry ,
but , uh , an appeal of actual innocence
after years of appeals and decisions and @-@ and delays
has to stand on a much more ground
than an indecisive snitch .
your honor ...
no .
at a certain point ,
it has to be over , judgments must stand .
god forgive me ...
i find for the state .
execution will proceed .
eddie , i need you to stand .
eddie , please .
place your hands out in front of you .
turn around , please .
you know the way , eddie .
you wanted to see me , mr. gold ?
oh , yes . hi , marilyn .
how are you ?
good .
i think we &apos;re off to a great start , don &apos;t you think ?
i do , i do .
and i have some good news .
peter wants to promote you to the transit authority ...
board .
i ...
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
yes , uh , an opening has
opened up on the transit authority board ,
uh , where you will have authority ... over transit .
it &apos;s a step up .
congratulations .
did i do something wrong ?
no , you did something right .
it &apos;s a promotion .
no , marilyn .
peter promoted you .
if he &apos;d wanted to tell you that himself , he would have .
you guys are making a mistake .
maybe .
you have a good evening .
how did it go ?
well . she took it like a pro .
she &apos;s right , you know ,
we need a new chief of staff .
she &apos;s not right , she &apos;s anal .
well , anal &apos;s what we need right now .
did i just say that ?
yes .
our new state motto ?
i &apos;ll make up a list .
why don &apos;t you do it ?
what ? be chief of staff ?
but i ...
i &apos;m working on your next campaign , sir .
my next campaign is here in this office .
i screw that up , there &apos;s nowhere to go but down .
you &apos;re going tonight ?
no .
we did everything we could .
not everything .
we want to put an i.v. in early , eddie ,
so there isn &apos;t the same confusion at midnight .
tell us if you feel any pain .
you should feel a small pinprick
as we attempt to put in the i.v.
the monitor you see above your ankle is a veinmapper .
it uses ultraviolet imaging to help find veins .
okay , the pain should be over in a minute , eddie .
warden , excuse me .
what ?
there &apos;s somebody out here for you .
i &apos;ll be right back with you , eddie .
excuse me .
we &apos;re in the midst of a protocol . what is it ?
yes , our apologies , sir .
my name is agent lionel franklin from the south bend office
of the drug enforcement administration .
it &apos;s come to our attention that you &apos;ve transported
toxic chemicals through the u.s. postal service .
are you serious ?
it &apos;s a direct violation of 49 u.s.c. 5101 .
have you transported any such chemicals ?
we use potassium chloride in our l.i. protocol ,
and , yes , we transferred it by overnight post .
i &apos;m gonna have to confiscate those chemicals .
the governor has put the execution on hold , eddie .
they don &apos;t want to try a third time .
it &apos;s over , eddie .
thank you . thank you .
good work .
thanks .
were you the one who called the dea ?
now , what would make you think that ?
it was a smart move .
have some ?
will ?
i need to tell you something .
no , you don &apos;t , alicia .
look , i know why you didn &apos;t call , and it &apos;s okay .
we were on a merry @-@ go @-@ round and we needed to get off ,
so we &apos;re off .
that &apos;s all .
don &apos;t end up hating me .
what ?
nothing . have a good night .
are you sure you don &apos;t want some ?
no , i &apos;m good .
