alicia .
this shouldn &apos;t take more than 15 minutes , right , alicia ?
you accept the guilty plea ,
you don &apos;t see more than a day of jail time ,
and it &apos;s expunged from your record in 24 months .
yes .
two years and a day of community service ,
and ... you know .
next ...
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
this guy means a lot of money .
he wants to hear it from you , not me .
i know , i &apos;m just taking a minute to catch up , that &apos;s all .
hey , bernie .
what are you doing upstairs ?
seeing how the other half lives .
hi , alicia .
bernie .
we really miss you downstairs .
there &apos;s my guys .
what &apos;s this ?
uh , the overflow from downstairs , your honor .
male 128 , 29 , 30 .
okay , got it .
you understand you are pleading guilty , sir ?
yes , your honor , i understand .
six months probation .
next .
what do you have ?
your honor , we have frank lister .
he is charged with disorderly conduct .
this is his second offense .
$ 1,500 .
next defendant .
do we know that guy ?
which guy ?
the convict in the middle .
he just whispered , &quot; help me . &quot;
fine . okay , let &apos;s handle the overflow .
male 128 , let &apos;s go .
disorderly conduct . do we have a plea here ?
uh , we &apos;ve already pled not guilty , your honor .
we &apos;re ready to go to trial .
good . mr. asa ?
almost , your honor .
we &apos;re still trying to locate a witness .
we ask for a continuance .
how long do you need ?
two months should do it .
good . continuance granted .
we &apos;ll go to trial april 15 .
sheriff , please escort the defendant back to lockup .
you were in bond court eight months ago .
yes .
you were my second client .
you ... you &apos;ve been in prison all this time ?
yes .
but it was just a disorderly charge .
i know .
with $ 150,000 bail .
i couldn &apos;t afford it .
but that was to punish me , not you .
didn &apos;t your case get called ?
three times .
the prosecutor keeps needing to find a witness .
didn &apos;t bernie ask for a speedy trial any of those three times ?
no , he &apos;s new , he wasn &apos;t my lawyer .
you &apos;ve had three different lawyers ?
four with you .
what the hell is going on here ?
what &apos;s your name ?
clayton riggs .
i &apos;m alicia florrick .
yeah , and i &apos;m bernie . let &apos;s go , alicia .
visiting hours are over .
you want my help ?
alicia , stop talking to my client .
sir , if you want my help , you can switch lawyers .
alicia , i need you to get the hell out .
he &apos;s been in jail for eight months .
he lost his job , his wife .
his son is with child services .
and you want to do what for him ?
get him out .
schakowsky is never gonna change the trial date , you know that .
he will if we sue him .
judges have immunity .
not if they knowingly violate a defendant &apos;s civil rights .
is this about getting back at schakowsky ?
no .
no .
then is this to assuage your guilty conscience ?
this is about getting a man who has been unlawfully imprisoned
for eight months out of jail so he can be with his kid .
and you &apos;re doing this pro bono .
it &apos;s civil .
we &apos;ll take 20 % of the $ 1.3 million .
no .
because there &apos;ll never be $ 1.3 million .
you &apos;re back .
i thought you were gone for another few months .
yeah , i didn &apos;t like it .
can i come in ?
yeah , sorry .
see my hat ?
&quot; take a byte out of silicon valley . &quot;
i do .
and ... i got you oven mitts .
thank you .
uh , well , you ... you have any work ?
can you work ?
i can .
how much ?
$ 20 raise .
um , can i talk to my partner about it ?
sure , yeah .
give me a call .
okay , i will .
jason .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
okay .
hey , it &apos;s jason crouse .
i &apos;m back in chicago .
you need anything ?
yes , as a matter of fact , right now .
what &apos;s going on there , a gang war ?
worse , illinois park college
is trying to close down its student newspaper .
ah , so a big case .
the daughter of a client , $ 33 million a year in billings .
on my way .
thank you , ms. lockhart .
imogen .
i keep thinking of you as a perpetual 14 @-@ year @-@ old .
yeah , my mom does , too .
how are you holding up in here ?
this is not what i expected .
yeah , it &apos;s weird to be the most hated person on campus .
just like your mother .
it &apos;s hate speech ,
and this campus is supposed to be a safe space .
it &apos;s an editorial , it &apos;s not arguing anything hateful .
you called the administrators &quot; mindless lemmings ...
about to fall off the cliff of fascism . &quot;
yes , because you &apos;re thinking of divesting from israel
管理层的剥离以色列计划中充满了反犹太主义色彩
and requiring stamps on all products made by israelis in the west bank .
i wrote an editorial about it , that &apos;s all .
i understand why you don &apos;t like it ,
but closing down the paper ...
the fact that the school is willing
to stand up for oppressed populations--
it &apos;s why a lot of us chose to come here .
um , dean randolph ,
if i may .
oh , yes , you &apos;re the lawyer ,
here to speak for ms. stowe , yes .
that &apos;s right .
we understand that illinois park college
is a private institution and not governed by the first amendment ,
but , uh , you are governed by your student handbook ,
a binding legal contract .
and the handbook lists &quot; freedom from persecution &quot;
as the school &apos;s primary commitment .
and i think it &apos;s hard to argue that
a threat to defund the school newspaper is anything but persecution .
oh , no , the move to defund the paper
is not a sword , but a shield--
to protect the safe space gary &apos;s talking about .
oh , well , the handbook also says
the school promotes &quot; tolerance of diverse viewpoints . &quot;
ms. stowe clearly has a diverse viewpoint and chose to ...
i helped write that handbook , ma &apos;am , and i can tell you
we did not have your interpretation in mind .
we meant to protect the viewpoints of diverse people .
the people , themselves .
not the viewpoints .
i , um ...
before i , um ...
take issue with that idea ,
it is a well @-@ established legal principle
that a party to a contract does not also get to interpret that contr ...
i &apos;m sure , but this is not a court of law , it &apos;s a school .
but you should realize that any university--
public or private-- must stand for basic notions of fairness .
and that is what we are here to do :
enforce progressive notions of fairness .
so why don &apos;t we at least take a preliminary vote ,
see where we &apos;re at .
all those in favor
of defunding the courier for the current school year .
so is that it ?
no , actually .
this handbook guarantees your right
to take your grievances to arbitration .
do you want to ?
alicia .
good .
hello .
thanks for dropping by .
i need to say it again .
i &apos;m sorry i hurt you .
i &apos;m sorry for erasing the message .
like i said , a day hasn &apos;t passed when i haven &apos;t ...
what did it say ?
what ?
the voice mail-- what did it say ?
what i told you before .
i want to know ...
everything he said , word for word .
alicia , it &apos;s been six years , i &apos;m not sure ...
and a day hasn &apos;t passed that you haven &apos;t thought about it ,
so ... what did it say ?
&quot; you want to know what my plan is ?
my plan is that i love you . &quot;
and then he said something about georgetown .
what about georgetown ?
how he &apos;d always loved you , ever since georgetown .
what else ?
don &apos;t stop .
alicia , i don &apos;t think this is a good idea .
i want to know it all .
i want to know every single word he said .
you &apos;re torturing yourself .
which is my right .
he said he would meet you anywhere ,
and you can make a plan then .
did he mention a place ?
no .
a time ?
no .
is that important ?
what else ?
just that if this didn &apos;t make sense to you ,
to ignore him , ignore the message ...
and things will go on as usual .
so when i didn &apos;t respond , he thought i got the message ...
and things ...
we just ... we went back to usual ?
yes , i guess .
are you out of your tiny little mind , mrs. florrick ?
you don &apos;t need to say &quot; little &quot; when you say &quot; tiny . &quot;
one or the other will do .
you &apos;re suing me ?
you &apos;re suing a sitting judge ?
do you understand the meaning of professional suicide ?
i know the meaning of a judge
who let an innocent man sit in prison
for eight months with a bail amount ...
did you miss the day in law school where they taught
the concept of judicial immunity ?
that protects you from being sued
for what you did professionally , not personally .
this crusade is gonna cost you .
it &apos;s gonna cost you so much .
shall we get that down on tape , your honor ?
your ex parte threats ?
i didn &apos;t think so .
see you in court !
you can &apos;t second @-@ guess agents of the judiciary , your honor .
as you yourself know ,
judges need wide @-@ ranging discretion
in order to do their jobs
and not worry about taking an unpopular stance
or making an honest mistake .
discretion , yes , but it can &apos;t be unlimited .
judicial immunity has to be unlimited .
yes , but we are filing a civil rights claim
under 42 u.s.c. 1983 .
going after the judge personally is merely an end @-@ around ...
no .
we are holding don schakowsky accountable
as an individual for violating
mr. riggs &apos; sixth amendment right to a speedy trial
and eighth amendment freedom
from cruel and unusual punishment .
he exceeded his authority ,
so he has to answer to this personally .
your honor , this is a direct attack
on the foundation of an independent judiciary .
imagine that your decision here ,
in this case , could be subject to a suit .
it would be chaos .
exactly .
mrs. florrick may like or dislike
the way his honor schakowsky does his job .
but she does not have the right to veto it .
we &apos;re not asking for a veto , your honor .
this man has been held in prison for eight months ,
his bail set at $ 150,000 .
$ 150,000 ?
what did he do ?
the charge is disorderly conduct .
$ 150,000 for disorderly conduct ?
yes , your honor .
three men knocked him down
coming out of a concert and stole his wallet .
when the police arrived , they arrested him , too .
he was the victim , not the perpetrator .
that isn &apos;t proven yet .
yes , because schakowsky ...
his honor schakowsky .
his honor schakowsky
has delayed trial three times .
three times , your honor .
and eight months later ,
our client is still in prison .
he lost his job , his wife divorced him ,
and his eight @-@ year @-@ old child has been taken from his home .
that is unjust .
we ask that you rule on my client &apos;s immunity , your honor .
there is no suit here if my client is found immune .
i would agree .
thank you , your honor .
no , i would agree that , from all appearances ,
mr. riggs has had his civil rights violated ,
but the question is whether his honor schakowsky did so knowingly .
if he did , his immunity is stripped .
the issue here concerns
the contractual language in the handbook ?
actually , the issue is free speech ...
yeah , and the idea of original intent .
thank you . uh , we &apos;ll all get a lot further
if we take this one at a time .
ms. reed ?
yes , mr. arbitrator , thank you .
geoffrey , please .
now , you claim the handbook permits the school to defund its newspaper ?
yes . above all ,
illinois park is committed to protecting individual liberty .
and ms. stowe &apos;s editorial failed to take seriously the life experiences
not just of the palestinian people ,
but of individuals on park &apos;s very campus .
i wouldn &apos;t expect a school like park--
or truthfully , any university--
to use the fact that it &apos;s privately funded
to cut off debate about how it treats its students .
although , technically , it can .
isn &apos;t the school the publisher here ?
yes , geoffrey , it is .
you can &apos;t win this case .
i know .
not with that argument .
i know .
it was a nice try , though .
what do you mean , not with that argument ?
is there another argument ?
i came in here , and this campus
is like a city .
they &apos;ve got their own campus police ,
they &apos;ve got medical facilities , food .
they have their own power plant , did you know that ?
i didn &apos;t . but i &apos;m not sure ...
have you heard of evans v. newton ?
&quot; state actor &quot; ?
yeah .
who are you ?
just your friendly neighborhood investigator .
no , that &apos;s a deep backwater of the law .
where did you get that ?
i dabble a bit now and then .
what do i have to do to get you to come and work for us ?
i am working for you .
no , in an office . full time .
with a desk . and lunches brought in .
i don &apos;t like offices .
then without an office .
i don &apos;t know .
make me an offer .
after you pled &quot; not guilty , &quot; clayton , what happened then ?
the judge slapped me with a six @-@ figure bail .
and after arraignment , did you appear
before judge schakowsky again ?
yeah . every couple months ,
they &apos;d stick me in the van , bring me over .
i &apos;d be all ready for the trial ,
and then the prosecutor &apos;d ask for more time .
and the judge gave it ?
he never even blinked .
even though the prosecutor was delaying
to find the same witness ?
yes .
isn &apos;t it true , mr. riggs ,
that this wasn &apos;t your first criminal offense ?
objection . mr. riggs &apos; past is irrelevant
to schakowsky &apos;s immunity .
goes to the issue of why judge schakowsky set bail so high .
overruled .
in fact , didn &apos;t the judge
in that weapons case have to issue a bench warrant
because you missed a court appearance ?
that was a few years ago . i was young and dumb .
i turned myself in and i didn &apos;t screw up again .
didn &apos;t you agree to each of the three continuances in your case ?
no .
i never agreed .
really ?
because i have transcripts of all three hearings ,
and every one of them clearly notes :
&quot; continuance by agreement . &quot;
in your brochure for the school ,
you write ...
&quot; park intends to be a city within a city .
a student can shop , dine , and even go to a movie
without setting foot off the campus . &quot;
is that true ?
indeed , park is a good school--
an excellent one , in fact .
thanks for pointing that out .
but by taking over these public functions ,
park has effectively become a &quot; state actor &quot;
and should be treated like a public school . hasn &apos;t it ?
that is a reach .
not according to the supreme court .
evans v. newton ,
marsh v. alabama .
if i &apos;m not mistaken ,
those cases are about company towns ...
yes , and that &apos;s exactly
what park has become .
a state actor .
you &apos;re saying : the more the college takes on
governmental responsibilities ,
the more it can be treated like an arm of the government .
yes . but i &apos;m not saying that , the supreme court is .
in which case the first amendment would apply .
yes , and park cannot censor its paper .
geoffrey , please ...
hang on .
mr. bukovitz , how many times
have you appeared before judge schakowsky ?
lots .
did judge schakowsky ever use his position
to influence your representation of a client ?
i don &apos;t even know what that means .
did he ever yell to intimidate you ?
did he ever badger you to accept a plea deal ?
no .
you know you &apos;re under oath , mr. bukovitz ?
i @-@ i do , ms. quinn ,
but i also know schakowsky is tough .
he wants to move fast .
but bond court requires it .
what does &quot; tax &quot; mean ?
what ?
tax .
not tax as in income tax .
but what does it mean when schakowsky taxes you ?
on june 18 of last year , did you tell me
that schakowsky taxed you ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t remember .
there were three other witnesses .
i have the affidavits .
look .
sometimes-- and i mean sometimes--
schakowsky flies off the handle
and says things that i &apos;m sure he doesn &apos;t mean ,
like he &apos;ll tax your client .
meaning ... ?
meaning he &apos;ll raise the bond amount .
but it &apos;s very rare .
and what did he raise the bond to
the time he taxed you ?
$ 250,000 .
thank you , mr. bukovitz .
let me take the cross .
it &apos;s a bad idea , your honor .
not with this witness .
trust me .
your honor .
is judge schakowsky intending to question ?
i am , actually . if your honor doesn &apos;t mind .
i don &apos;t , but i imagine you know all the reasons not to .
i do .
so i defer to your better judgment .
have you ever practiced in front of judge falcone ?
or judge marc ?
i ... yes , a few times .
if you checked the clerk of the court &apos;s annual report ,
you &apos;d see they set bail , on average ,
about ten percent higher than i do .
objection , he &apos;s testifying .
could you rephrase , your honor ?
with pleasure .
did you know they set bail , on average ,
about ten percent higher than i did ?
your honor ,
these are very different cases .
they were felonies and ...
mrs. florrick .
please don &apos;t interrupt .
thank you .
did mrs. florrick ever argue that
i hurried her too much in court ?
objection , relevance .
it puts the motive of the plaintiff in context , your honor .
i &apos;ll allow it .
yes , she did argue that .
did you ever think i hurried you too much in court ?
no .
did you ever think i set bail too high ?
no .
did you ever think i badgered
the lawyers or their clients ?
no .
did you ever observe me
infringing on the civil rights of anyone ?
no .
thank you , mr. bukovitz .
your honor , i also have affidavits .
they &apos;re from dozens of lawyers in my court
supporting mr. bukovitz &apos;s observations .
okay , thank you .
i don &apos;t need to hear any more here .
there &apos;s evidence that judge schakowsky is busy .
perhaps even brusque .
but not that he exceeded his authority .
in which case , his immunity should remain intact .
the motion to dismiss is granted .
how was silicon valley ?
it was warm .
i was surprised you were back .
why didn &apos;t you call ?
i came by .
alicia didn &apos;t tell you ?
no .
we need you on a case .
are you sure ?
i think alicia was worried about the money .
what &apos;s the money ?
$ 20 raise .
she was gonna check with you about it .
what did you do to her ?
no .
i was in california .
come on , you screwed with her head .
no , i didn &apos;t .
you did your smile thing .
your bedroom eyes b.s.
&quot; oh , i &apos;m just a guy &apos;s guy .
i don &apos;t know what i do to women . &quot;
lucca , look at me .
i didn &apos;t do a thing .
seriously .
bernie ?
what &apos;s up ?
clayton riggs still wants to sue for his imprisonment .
i know . we &apos;re revising our strategy with schakowsky .
we already did .
&quot; we already did &quot; ?
what does that mean ?
clayton and me .
i met with him after you left court .
i signed him as a client .
you snaked him ?
yes .
we &apos;re also suing you for malpractice .
ms. lockhart has argued
that illinois park is a state actor .
we don &apos;t agree with this characterization
but think it &apos;s irrelevant .
even in public colleges ,
students don &apos;t have unfettered rights of expression .
nothing my client has done rises to a level of ...
&quot; schools are allowed to prohibit any expression
&quot; that creates material and substantial disruptions
&quot; in school activities
or invades the rights of others . &quot;
and do you have any evidence of such invasion or disruption ?
mr. binazir , you requested
the school boycott israeli goods from the settlements ?
yes .
endorsing them is endorsing a decades @-@ long occupation
that has led to thousands of deaths .
and how did you feel when the school
decided to boycott the products ?
i felt heard and respected .
and how did you feel when ms. stowe
published her editorial ?
under attack ,
disrespected , unsafe .
here &apos;s what i don &apos;t understand , mr. binazir .
you &apos;re on a politically engaged campus .
how is this controversy different from all the others ?
black lives matter ?
the iraq war ?
it &apos;s never got physical before .
uh , my roommate was pushed to the ground and stepped on
just trying to get to class .
okay , got it .
ms. lockhart ?
ms. stowe ,
was it your intent to disrupt student activities ?
not at all .
was it your intent to infringe on the rights of other students ?
no , i was just speaking my mind ,
trying to engage them .
it &apos;s important for someone to present a contrary viewpoint .
at any cost ?
no . but to be fair , the disruption saum
is describing was temporary .
people are already settling down .
and in a few days ,
they &apos;ll be on to the next crusade .
but you won &apos;t , because the only permanent disruption here
is leaving the school
without a freely functioning newspaper .
i did not commit malpractice .
it &apos;s not about you , it &apos;s about a payday .
a $ 1.2 million payday .
what &apos;s our malpractice cap ?
$ 300,000 .
oh , god .
it was all we could afford .
so we fight .
what do they have ?
i don &apos;t know .
we should put an investigator on it .
should i call jason ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s probably too expensive .
we can probably talk him down .
i met him last night .
why ?
he &apos;s a friend .
how close a friend ?
seriously ?
are you gonna hate the whole world right now ?
what did he say last night ?
he said you were gonna talk to me about his raise .
i think we were both surprised that you hadn &apos;t talked to me .
well , there was a lot going on .
a lot that would &apos;ve been alleviated
by having an investigator .
what &apos;s going on , partner ?
would you like to talk ?
i don &apos;t know anymore .
do you want me to talk ?
i was in love .
he died .
i found out he left me a message that he loved me ,
but i didn &apos;t get it .
now i &apos;m sick to death of ...
... everything .
this apartment .
this laundry .
the fact that things get dirty .
the law .
just ... standing here .
sometimes i swear i just want to go into my bedroom ,
pull the covers over my head ,
and never do anything ever again .
i &apos;m drinking like i never have before .
and all i want to do is have another one .
and then everything just gets swallowed up by
more disgust .
i &apos;m not built to be an unhappy person .
i like laughing .
i laugh like a banshee
at videos on youtube .
and then i just sit here
alone in this stupid little apartment ...
wondering what the hell happened to my life .
was it all about having two kids--
who i don &apos;t even know if i like anymore--
and just shoving them off to be someone important ?
seriously , was that the point ? !
i just ...
i @-@ i hurt .
and i @-@ i @-@ i ...
i want it over !
i just want it to end !
i just ...
i was loved .
and it &apos;s ...
over , over !
so why am i doing this ? !
alicia ...
you are here
because i need you here .
i don &apos;t like people .
but i like you .
i don &apos;t even think i like my brother .
he bothers me .
i have no friends .
i &apos;m 30 years old and i don &apos;t ...
have a single friend .
but i want to be your friend .
i mean , do you have a ring or something ?
i &apos;ll commit .
because that &apos;s the one thing you can choose .
me ...
here wanting to be your friend .
everything else is just handed to you .
all you have to do is say
i &apos;m willing .
no , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m serious .
you have to say it .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m willing .
good .
now , i have to ask you this .
do you have any guns in this apartment ?
no .
good .
&apos;cause you scared me there for a minute .
you &apos;re gonna have to testify .
i know .
but you &apos;re gonna need another lawyer .
who ?
cary agos , your honor ,
representing alicia florrick in this matter .
cary agos , your honor ,
representing alicia florrick in this matter .
so the plaintiff is now the defendant .
a witness is now mr. riggs &apos; attorney .
there seems to be a round of musical chairs
while i wasn &apos;t looking .
yes , your honor , i spoke to clayton ,
and he wants to sue his lawyer , mrs. florrick .
and i guess you , mrs. florrick , you would move for dismissal ?
yes , we would , your honor .
okay , this is exciting . let &apos;s go .
before the music stops and we &apos;re all in different chairs .
who knows ? i may be the plaintiff next .
so , clayton , did mrs. florrick
ever take the time to consult with you about your plea ?
maybe 15 seconds .
your bail ?
the judge set it .
she tried to say something ,
then she got nervous .
she didn &apos;t try to slow the proceedings down
or explain to you what was happening
and what your options were ?
no .
no more questions , your honor .
your current lawyer , bernie bukovitz ,
he isn &apos;t actually your new lawyer , is he ?
what do you mean ?
he represented you in front of judge schakowsky before .
oh , yeah , right .
he was my fourth lawyer .
and he didn &apos;t help you out any more
than alicia florrick did , did he ?
no .
i &apos;m sure everyone has sympathy for you , mr. riggs .
but isn &apos;t this really a case of bad luck ?
and you just wanting to--
as you said to mrs. florrick-- sue somebody ?
i just want to get out .
yes , mrs. florrick
started as a bond lawyer in my court .
and did you have an opinion about her professionalism
or lack thereof ?
objection-- calls for a conclusion .
expert witness .
your honor , the judge is an expert witness .
he &apos;s allowed to express his opinion .
sustained . you may answer .
yes , mrs. florrick did not demonstrate
the duty of care i would expect .
and if she had ?
if she had informed me promptly and efficiently ,
i might &apos;ve had a better context to set mr. riggs &apos; bail .
should you have done more to try to pull
that information out of her ?
my role is to adjudicate .
not advocate .
all right , well , i went through the transcripts
from schakowsky &apos;s courtroom , looking for abuses ,
looking for any mention of taxing lawyers .
and ?
nothing .
not a single mention of taxing .
he always covers the microphone when he says it .
yep , that &apos;s kind of what i figured .
so , what , we &apos;re screwed ?
no .
i talked to his courtroom reporter .
she hears everything . darla .
a very nice lady .
she goes to the track every weekend .
it turns out schakowsky talks really fast ,
so she started recording him
so she could get every word .
and you have the tapes ?
i do .
i wasn &apos;t myself earlier .
things were swirling around in my head .
and now they &apos;re not ?
well , now they &apos;re in perspective .
good .
perspective is good .
i just , i didn &apos;t want you to think that ...
here &apos;s the thing , alicia .
whenever you worry about what i might be thinking ,
or you worry that i &apos;m upset about what you &apos;re thinking ,
just know that ... i &apos;m fine .
even when i &apos;m not fine ,
i &apos;m really fine .
i got to go .
are you still fine ?
yeah .
do you remember when mr. bukovitz mentioned
that you taxed attorneys , your honor ?
i do .
is that a term you regularly use ?
only when discussing my income .
but not in the context of punishing an attorney
for not doing what you want .
no .
not that i recall .
good .
then maybe this will refresh your recollection .
i simply want a plea , guilty or not guilty .
uh , i @-@ i need a moment to actually confer with my ...
objection !
you &apos;re a witness , you can &apos;t object .
i already warned you .
objection , this is hearsay .
there &apos;s no foundation .
we have an affidavit
from the person who recorded this audio .
yeah , i understand , if i could just ...
i &apos;m taxing you and your ...
none of that matters .
i did not consent to being recorded .
two @-@ party consent isn &apos;t required .
standard two @-@ party consent isn &apos;t required but mine is .
that was recorded in my courtroom
where i forbid the use of recording devices .
it is the equivalent of you being recorded
right now in your court .
i agree , this tape is inadmissible .
your honor , that is completely self @-@ serving .
no , mrs. florrick , this is a matter of respect .
the tapes are excluded .
dean randolph ,
does the student handbook say ,
&quot; park is dedicated to empowering students
by encouraging autonomy
and the development of personal responsibility &quot; ?
it does .
and did the student body demonstrate this responsibility
in their reaction to ms. stowe &apos;s editorial ?
oh , yes , they &apos;re the ones who petitioned the student council
to have ms. stowe removed and the paper defunded .
this was entirely a student body move ?
yes .
thank you , dean .
do you agree with the way the students handled imogen &apos;s oped ?
i do .
and if you didn &apos;t ?
well , if the council voted one way or the other ,
i &apos;d respect it .
part of learning how to make decisions
is learning how to live with poor decisions .
last halloween , you disciplined a student
for wearing a &quot; caitlyn &quot; costume ,
原名布鲁斯 · 詹纳 2015年变性为女
which you said made fun of trans students .
you did , not the student council .
well , no one brought a petition to the student council ,
but that didn &apos;t mean that the ...
yes , but before the council acts , after it acts ,
whether it acts at all , you do .
the final responsibility rests with the adult faculty ,
not the students .
if we could just look at chapter three of the student handbook ...
i think we &apos;ve all heard enough about the handbook , ms. reed .
ms. lockhart is right .
the administration is really still in charge ,
and since we &apos;re considering them state actors ,
they can &apos;t censor the newspaper .
the defunding of the student paper is hereby reversed .
have a nice day , everyone .
we &apos;re adjourned .
every attorney who comes to bond court has a learning curve ,
but mrs. florrick &apos;s curve wasn &apos;t about being a good advocate .
what do you mean ?
well , she knew her way around a courtroom .
judge schakowsky liked to call her marie antoinette ,
but she wasn &apos;t afraid to get her hands dirty
or ask for help when she needed it .
so what kind of learning curve was she on ?
figuring out how to deal with schakowsky .
thank you .
so you &apos;re saying mrs. florrick was as diligent
as any other lawyer in bond court ?
yes , bernie , i am saying that .
even though she had all sorts of other obligations ?
i mean , wife of a governor who was running for president .
i think she handled it with aplomb .
even though she missed a whole morning at bond court ?
18 cases we had to cover ,
so she could tape an episode of mama &apos;s homespun cooking .
i &apos;m not saying she didn &apos;t have to make trade @-@ offs .
trade @-@ offs are one thing , but what about the time
you had to rush out of judge schakowsky &apos;s court
to cover a probate case of hers ?
that was because of you , bernie .
because you didn &apos;t show up .
n @-@ n @-@ no , it wasn &apos;t my day .
it was your day ...
you had given me ...
okay , thank you .
thank you !
any more questions , counselor ?
just one more .
didn &apos;t you tell don weingarten , another bond attorney ,
that you feel sorry for anyone
who gets alicia florrick as an attorney ?
i did .
but i don &apos;t believe that anymore .
i wouldn &apos;t be her law partner if i did .
you did end up with will .
you act like i prevented the love affair of the ages ,
but you two did end up together ,
and i did not keep you from doing that .
yes , i know i erased it , and i &apos;ve already apologized .
and maybe you would have had
another three months together ,
but that would have had no impact
on what happened to will , none .
you can &apos;t control fate .
just like i can &apos;t tell if i walked under that tree
and not this one , uh , the branch wouldn &apos;t break off and kill me .
and one more thing .
it was hard for me to apologize .
i never do that .
and i never confess to anything .
but i did to you .
because i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;ve never been more sorry about anything in my life .
okay , eli .
you &apos;re forgiven .
really ?
yes .
i &apos;ll talk to you later , okay ?
so what do you think ?
there &apos;s not enough here for malpractice .
he &apos;ll sustain our motion to dismiss .
and if he doesn &apos;t ?
we sit down and offer to settle .
all rise .
i find there is enough here to go to trial .
the motion to dismiss is denied .
$ 1.5 million .
oh , come on .
bernie , you know how this works .
you &apos;re never getting $ 1.5 million in a verdict ,
and you &apos;re never getting $ 1.5 million from us .
so what can you accept ?
$ 1.5 million .
and i disagree that i won &apos;t get it at trial .
i might even get more .
you &apos;re not well @-@ liked , alicia .
well , we &apos;ll see you in court .
people think you &apos;re rich .
you &apos;re the wife of the governor
and the loser in the presidential primary .
he &apos;s not well @-@ liked either .
$ 1.5 million .
nice talking to you .
you &apos;ve lost it , haven &apos;t you ?
oh , yes , i have .
good news ?
no . no , no , no .
very bad news , actually .
yep , we got shafted
by the brotherhood of the robe .
our insurance doesn &apos;t even come close to covering this .
and we won &apos;t be able to afford our lawyer .
last i looked , you two were lawyers .
yes .
two tired lawyers .
i &apos;m heading home .
we &apos;ll talk tomorrow .
yep .
i should go , too .
no , you should stay .
you should think things through with alicia .
are you still fine ?
yeah .
so a funny thing happened yesterday .
in the elevator ?
yeah . no , um , before that .
i got offered a job at lockhart / agos .
i said no , but they offered a lot of money .
and then you said yes .
no , because i didn &apos;t want to make it seem
like it was about us yesterday .
ah , i see .
well , you should do what &apos;s best for you .
yeah , well , sometimes i can &apos;t tell what that is .
well , it usually involves seeing which number is higher .
yes .
so that didn &apos;t end well , did it ?
no .
i heard from lucca , they don &apos;t want to settle .
they don &apos;t .
and you &apos;re looking for a new place of business ?
yes .
homeowners &apos; association .
and we &apos;re looking for new associates .
lost half in a bit of a rebellion .
oh , god .
what ?
would it be so bad to come back ?
as an associate ?
no .
you want me back as a partner ?
diane would not want me back as a partner .
a junior partner .
you guys fired me .
no , we didn &apos;t .
that was dipple .
and , anyway , his people like you a lot more
now that peter lost the nomination , so ...
look .
we can help you cover any loss you experience .
make it a part of your settlement .
come on , alicia .
come on home .
