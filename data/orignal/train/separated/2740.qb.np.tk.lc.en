the honorable dennis holzer of the eastern district of new york presiding .
court is now in session . be seated .
come to order .
the defendant &apos;s request for temporary release from federal custody
to attend his daughter &apos;s wedding is ludicrous .
mr. sacrimoni is a known member of organized crime
at the helm of a vast criminal conspiracy .
i notice you &apos;re wearing a wedding ring , ms. vaughn .
was your father at your wedding ?
my father wasn &apos;t awaiting trial on 47 rlco predicates ,
including murder .
mr. sacrimoni ...
your application is granted .
oh , thank god !
on the following conditions . quiet !
you &apos;ll be released for a total of six hours
to attend the church service and party thereafter .
during the entirety of the six hours ,
you will be escorted by u.s. marshals .
the cost of their presence , transportation
and the cost of metal detection screening equipment
is to be borne by you at your own expense .
you will consume no alcohol
nor other intoxicating substances .
do you understand and agree to these conditions ?
i do , your honor , and thank you .
mrs. soprano , good morning . i &apos;m perry ... annunziata .
come in .
beautiful house .
you are gina annunziata &apos;s cousin , right ?
muscles marinara , the ltalian strongman .
i &apos;m just glad you got somebody capable of protecting you ,
driving for you .
well , that &apos;s why i got him here .
she worries , my wife .
yeah , well ...
he &apos;s in good hands , mrs. soprano .
first runner @-@ up , mr. teenage bloomfield .
your first day back at work .
gosh , i feel like a mommy .
hey . come on .
see you later .
so what do you do ? free weights , machines ?
little bit of both . depends what muscles i &apos;m trying to hit , you know ?
oh .
yeah , i gotta get back to the gym .
you want , i &apos;ll make you a program .
there was a time when i could bench over 300 lbs .
with a major head cold one time , i did it .
you cough with weights like that over your head ,
you crush your neck . i guess i don &apos;t gotta tell you .
ho ! you don &apos;t signal ?
hey , fuck you !
sorry .
my mom says i should count 10 , but i never remember .
well , here i am .
back .
yep .
so let me ask you right off ,
is there any chance of a mercy fuck ?
just kidding .
how are you feeling ?
you went to medical school .
a gut shot is everything they ever told you it was .
and emotionally ?
i &apos;m happy to be alive .
have you spoken to your uncle since it happened ?
no . and won &apos;t .
finally get to sleep in my own bed tonight .
had a hospital bed in the house
last month and a half or so .
is sleeping difficult ?
tylenol helps .
what about dreams ,
night terrors , anything like that ?
gloom is your business , and business is good .
you were shot , anthony , by a member of your family .
i know .
and unless i know absolutely nothing
i think you and i &apos;ll have a lot to talk about .
are you familiar with the term
&quot; post @-@ traumatic stress &quot; ?
i get it , okay ?
my uncle tried to kill me , for the second time .
three strikes and i &apos;m out , right ?
who knows ? maybe l am suppressing things .
but for right now , i feel like each day is a gift .
i told my sister .
and that &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna stay .
fair enough .
is there something else you &apos;d like to talk about then ?
let &apos;s pick up where we left off before this all happened .
aj .
believe it or not ,
things have gotten worse with that kid .
flunked out of college . he waited till i was in a coma .
didn &apos;t you leave seton hall after a semester and a half ?
all right , fine ,
but why can &apos;t he copy some of the good things about me ?
does he have a job ?
blockbuster .
first stop on the shitbird express .
in some ways , this horrible shooting may provide an opportunity
for him to learn from your mistakes .
my mistakes--
i got caught up in domestic violence .
you think it can &apos;t happen to you , but it does .
but i was referring to the bigger picture :
the ready access to guns ,
the use of violence to solve disputes
because of the nature of your work , your uncle &apos;s work .
i told you i didn &apos;t want to talk about my uncle .
fine , but for now is it safe to say
that there are worse ways to earn money
yeah , there are .
come on , you in or what ?
don &apos;t fuck with my concentration .
i &apos;ve warned you before .
what is it ? 800 more ?
fuck it . fold .
cards .
oh ! there &apos;s the skip .
back with a vengeance .
you look great .
how are you ?
welcome home , t.
come here , you malingerer you .
easy easy easy .
great to have you back , t.
fucking great to be back .
sit , ton &apos; , i &apos;ll clear your spot . - we got you your bialy
as soon as we heard you were coming in today .
nuke that joe so it &apos;s hot .
oh , fuck .
the onions-- i can &apos;t .
oh , scoop out that bialy .
i got it .
sorry .
i got it , ton &apos; , no problem .
there you go . i &apos;ll get your coffee , and you &apos;re all set .
so the municipal swimming pool--

i got a lunch tomorrow .

i had that with the spleen . staves off the infection .
spleen , my ass .
beat this .
oof , madonn &apos; .
fuck that .
check out this bad boy .
i had the plastic surgeon , taschlin , do the outside sutures .
plepler , the head trauma man , he did the inside work .
he dealt with the sepsis .
i was the first guy at the hospital to have the vac .
it &apos;s an open @-@ incision situation .
it &apos;s a better way to heal . less pulling on the outer dermis layers .
the thing is with all the ativan and the dilaudid i was taking ,
intestinal blockage was a constant fucking problem .
so in the long run--
there &apos;s your coffee , ton &apos; .
yeah .
ton &apos; , with your medicine ,
you want i set my watch so you don &apos;t gotta worry ? nurse betty over here .
when my mom had the lupus , god rest her soul ,
&apos;round the clock care i gave that woman .
medicine , food , lifted her in and out of the tub .
the man &apos;s trying to eat .
i &apos;m just saying .
another life i might have gone into health care . i actually enjoyed it .
how about a bandage over your mouth then ? we &apos;re trying to play .
you can lift a grown woman out of a tub ?
isn &apos;t it ironic ?
fucking hospital stay like mine ,
you lose goddamn muscle mass , not fat .
fucking believe it ?
you &apos;d think at least something good would have come out of the situation .
you in , ton &apos; ?
sure , why not ?
he &apos;s in . - same game , five @-@ card calls ?
same game . why ? you wanna change games now &apos; cause i won three pots ?
keep the cards down , sil .
the government &apos;s own neuropsychologist
clearly finds evidence of dementia .
evidence consistent with dementia .
nonetheless , i &apos;m going to recommend he be sent
to a prison psychiatric facility for further evaluation .
he &apos;ll only be warehoused in a public facility .
now , your honor , we ask that mr. soprano be sent
to a private locked facility . - why not a resort in antigua ?
you want his mental state improved so you can put him on trial ?
just let him go to a place where he can get better .
you got uncle angelo at table 19 ?
what ? he &apos;s with connie and them .
and when he sees aunt lorraine and the haitian boyfriend
sitting next to them ...
i thought you were on top of this . - there &apos;s 400 people , john .
i &apos;ve had other things on my mind .
and i &apos;m idling away the hours ?
who &apos;s not talking to who ?
this one can &apos;t see that one .
it &apos;s okay , honey . take it easy .
you were the one who wanted a big wedding .
catherine , your sister has enough to deal with without the commentary .
i &apos;m sorry i blew my stack , okay ?
we are gonna get through this as a family-- dignified , proud--
despite all the persecution and roadblocks .
and when i say family , that includes you , too , eric .
thank you , john .
thank you who ?
thank you , dad .
you ...
i want you to relax . make sure you eat .

during the healing process .

i was up by john . he sends his regards .
he &apos;d like you to do him a favor , though .
what now ?
our friend there , the mayor of munchkinland ,
john wants him gone .
jesus . rusty ?
john &apos;s worried he might find another puppet like little carmine ,
try to run the family through him .
so why me hit him ?
you guys got more buttons than my grandmother &apos;s fucking corsets .
john wants things to point away from the family .
you know what ? tell him no .
time and again i &apos;ve done his bidding .
it &apos;s time to set some limits .
really ?
yeah , really .
be well .

we bring somebody over from naples .

completely insulate ourselves . they do rusty ,
they &apos;re back on a plane over the atlantic two hours later .
i don &apos;t know , t. you ask me , farming it out is a pussy @-@ ass maneuver .
excuse me ?
ton &apos; , the rollatine !
hold on .
if we &apos;re gonna do it , we should do it ourselves ,
maintain control .
better yet , tell new york to fucking handle it already .
john just asked me specifically .
so it &apos;s like the movie then .
what movie ?
one . that you can &apos;t refuse a man &apos;s request
on his daughter &apos;s wedding day .
no , it &apos;s the other way around .
that i should be asking him for something he can &apos;t refuse .
so did you ?
no .
you should ask not to do this .
i already fucking agreed .
look , we wanna keep him placated , right ?
i mean , the shit with phil and his little brother
and the perpetual hard @-@ on he &apos;s still got with us .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea .
well , i didn &apos;t ask you what you fucking think .
come on .
you &apos;re going already ?
he &apos;s always like this at weddings .
you make me sound rude . crab cakes . i told you i don &apos;t feel good .

i &apos;ll tell you one thing , and i &apos;m not ashamed to say it ,
my estimation of john sacrimoni as a man
just fucking plummeted .
give him a break , will ya ?
it &apos;s an emotional day .
to cry like a woman ? it &apos;s a fucking disgrace .
his fucking coach turned into a pumpkin .
well , even cinderella didn &apos;t cry .
when it comes to daughters , all bets are off .
i &apos;ve seen tougher guys than john cry at weddings .
well , let me ask you this--
if they can make him cry and if he &apos;s that weak ,
what the fuck else can they make him do ?
i gotta agree with phil , ton &apos; .
oh , you do , do you ?

they &apos;re my friends ,
a lot of them , but they &apos;re also fucking jackals .

in a perfect world
i just relax ,
iet them think whatever the fuck they want .
act as if .
as if you &apos;re not feeling vulnerable .
as if you &apos;re the same old anthony .
strong , &quot; i &apos;m sure , &quot; decisive .
people see only what you allow them to see .
yeah , i been thinking the same thing .
thanks for the advice .
glad to be of service .
