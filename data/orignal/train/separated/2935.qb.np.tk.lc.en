hey , ross .
hey , joey .
hey , you .
hey , you .
and he brought flowers ! thanks , ross . i &apos;m really more of a candy kind of guy .
you &apos;re weird today .
listen , i wanted to talk to you about something .
yeah . actually , i kind of need to talk to you too .
joey , could you give us a minute ?
no .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry . i meant , &quot; no . &quot;
hi . hey , look who &apos;s here .
where &apos;s my granddaughter ? i &apos;ve been practicing my magic tricks .
he pulled a quarter out of my ear .
hey , where &apos;s mom ?
she went to pick up aunt liddy .
aunt liddy &apos;s coming ? that means we get $ 5 each !
so when do i get to meet emma and show her this :
okay , wow .
emma &apos;s in the nursery . i &apos;ll take you now if you want .
but i really want to talk to you .
i know . i still need to talk to you .
but before you guys do that , i need to talk to you .
and ross , i need to talk to you .
and i need to talk to you .
about what ?
to see if you know what these guys are talking about .
the.one.where.no.one.proposes
isn &apos;t she beautiful ?
look at her , my first grandchild .
what about ben ?
well , of course , ben . i meant my first granddaughter .
god , isn &apos;t she beautiful ? doesn &apos;t she look just like rachel ?
i know everybody keeps saying that , but all i see is vin diesel .
what do you think our baby will look like ?
oh , god . please . you .
but it &apos;ll have my sense of humor .
have you thought any more about you and rachel ?
yeah
actually i was gonna talk to her when you guys came in the room .
that &apos;s so exciting ! wow .
you could &apos;ve done that with us there .
yeah , right .
sure . okay .
you can touch yourself in front of us , but you can &apos;t talk to rachel .
what ? when have i ever touched myself in front of you guys ?
oh , please . just before , when you were asleep in the lounge .
that armenian family was watching you instead of the tv .
that reminds me . that mr. hazmegian still has my game boy .
chandler , can i talk to you for a second ?
sure .
dude , i just did something terrible .
that was you ? i thought it was jack .
no , no . that was jack . rachel thinks i asked her to marry me .
what ? why does she think that ?
because it kind of looked like i did .
again , what ?
okay , i was down on one knee with the ring in my hand ..
as we all are at some point during the day .
it wasn &apos;t my ring . it fell out of ross &apos; jacket ..
and when i knelt down to pick it up , rachel thought i was proposing .
ross had a ring ? and he was gonna propose ?
i guess .
and you did it first ?
this is gonna kill him . you know how much he loves to propose .
i know . i know . it &apos;s awful .
well , what did she say ?
she said , &quot; yes . &quot;
you &apos;re smiling .
no , i &apos;m not .
yes , you are . i can tell by the way your mouth is .
does ross know ?
oh , my god . what the hell am i gonna tell him ?
maybe you don &apos;t have to tell him .
i like that . yeah .
if you clear things up with rachel , ross never needs to find out .
but you have to do it before he hears about it and kicks your ass .
all right , let &apos;s not get carried away .
i want a baby .
honey , we &apos;ve been over this . i need to be facing the other way .
if we have sex again , it &apos;ll double our chances of getting pregnant .
i think that closet &apos;s still available .
i am so tired .
yeah , okay , but no foreplay .
deal !
dad , seriously !
you know , you really should see someone about that .
noted .
i wanna go talk to rachel for a minute . are you gonna be okay alone for a bit ?
are you kidding me ? i could stay and look at her forever .
actually ..
hey .
hi .
are you all right ?
i think i just got engaged .
oh , my god ! he did it ?
what ? did you know he was gonna ask me ?
are you kidding ? i &apos;m , like , the one who talked him into it .
i like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group .
and you really think this is a good idea ?
i just talked him into it .
don &apos;t tell me i have to do you too ?
the puppet master gets tired , people .
okay .
i don &apos;t know . it just doesn &apos;t feel right .
why ? you two are so meant to be together . everybody thinks so .
really ? even ross ?
especially ross .
hey , phoebe . you know what ? i &apos;ll come back later .
wow . kind of a full house here .
i guess i &apos;ll just .. i &apos;ll come back .
there he goes . your fiance .
i guess so .
although he does play with himself in his sleep .
i can &apos;t say i &apos;m surprised .
dad , what are you doing ?
there are people in there having sex .
it can &apos;t be me . i &apos;m standing right here .
wanna peek ?
no !
come on .
you know what ? i don &apos;t like you without mom .
come on .
we &apos;re not peeking ?
well , i &apos;m peeking .
oh , my god !
hello , sir . you know monica .
hey , is it okay to come in ?
of course .
joey , this ring , i .. it &apos;s beautiful . i love it .
yeah . look , rach , there &apos;s something i gotta tell you .
hey .
hi .
are you ready to try nursing again ?
yeah . hi , emma .
why do you think she won &apos;t take my breast ?
it &apos;s all right . it takes babies a while to get it .
but don &apos;t worry , it &apos;ll happen .
okay .
okay , sweetie , you can do it . just open up and put it in your mouth .
dear lord .
i &apos;m sorry , honey , what were you saying ?
yeah , look , i think that ..
because , look ! she &apos;s pulling away again .
do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth ?
she looks scared . doesn &apos;t she look scared ?
you know , i don &apos;t really know her .
why don &apos;t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow ?
okay .
are you kidding me ?
this is so frustrating . why doesn &apos;t she want my breast ?
i don &apos;t know ! maybe she &apos;s crazy !
hey , wait up .
hi .
congratulations .
i didn &apos;t want to say anything in front of joey . i didn &apos;t know if he knew .
what ? that we had a baby ? now let &apos;s give him a little credit .
although he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier .
no , no , that you and rachel are engaged .
what ?
oh , it &apos;s a secret ?
goody . yes ! we haven &apos;t done the secret thing in a long time .
no , rachel and i are not engaged .
i think you are .
what are you talking about ? who told you that ?
rachel , your betrothed .
we &apos;re not engaged .
oh , that &apos;s right . it &apos;s a secret .
right , you are not engaged . i misunderstood her .
phoebe , there is no secret , okay ? i didn &apos;t propose .
are you lying ?
is this like that time you tried to convince us you were a doctor ?
i am a doctor !
you know what ? i &apos;m just gonna go and talk to rachel myself .
all right . well , me too .
well , should we wake her up ?
no . no . come on , let her sleep .
she &apos;s so exhausted .
and so engaged .
oh , my god . she thinks we &apos;re engaged !
why ? why , why would she think we &apos;re engaged ?
perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring ?
you know , ross , doctors are supposed to be smart .
i didn &apos;t give her that ring .
you didn &apos;t ?
no !
so whose ring is it ?
it &apos;s mine .
is it an engagement ring ?
yes .
but you didn &apos;t give it to her ?
no .
but you were going to propose ?
no !
i might be losing interest in this .
look . look , my mom gave me that ring ..
because she wanted me to propose to rachel .
but all i wanted to do was see ..
if she maybe , kind of wanted to start things up again .
what beautiful lukewarm sentiment .
i didn &apos;t want to rush into anything . it seemed like she didn &apos;t want to either .
but i don &apos;t understand how any of this happened .
what , did she find the ring in my jacket , assume i was gonna propose ..
throw it on and just start telling people ?
no , no . she said you actually proposed to her .
well , i didn &apos;t ! i didn &apos;t propose !
unless ..
did i ?
i haven &apos;t slept in 40 hours and ..
it does sound like something i would do .
look , we can &apos;t stay in here forever .
it &apos;s just , i still can &apos;t believe that my dad saw us having sex .
he didn &apos;t make it to one of my piano recitals , but this he sees !
this is okay . we &apos;re all adults here . there &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
now , let &apos;s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door .
hi , dad .
i can still call you that , right ?
of course . i &apos;ll always be your dad .
i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there , that wasn &apos;t for fun .
it wasn &apos;t fun ?
why , why , why would you .. ?
look , i just don &apos;t want you to think ..
that we &apos;re animals who do it whenever we want .
well , i don &apos;t think that .
before today , i never thought of you two having sex at all .
it was a simpler time .
the truth is , dad , we &apos;re trying .
to kill you .
why , why , why would you .. ?
we &apos;re trying to have a baby .
what ?
yeah , we &apos;re trying to get pregnant .
oh , my god , this is so exciting .
well , get back in there ! i &apos;ll guard the door !
that &apos;s okay , dad , we can wait until later .
whoa ! i don &apos;t think so . aren &apos;t you ovulating ?
daddy !
you gotta get at it , princess .
when your mother and i were trying to conceive you ..
whenever she was ovulating , bam , we did it !
that &apos;s how i got my bad hip .
that &apos;s funny . this conversation &apos;s how i got the bullet hole in my head .
this one time i had my knee on the sink , and your mother was ..
seriously , sir , my brains , all over the wall .
i don &apos;t think we need to hear the specific positions you and mom had .
you &apos;re right . this is about your positions .
now , what i saw in the closet is not the optimum position ..
for conceiving a child .
although it might feel good .
i don &apos;t feel good right now .
but pleasure is important , and it helps if the woman has an orgasm .
you up to the task , sailor ?
oh , my god ..
hey .
hey . oh , i need to tell you something .
well , now &apos;s a good time . i &apos;m on my way to have my ears cut off .
joey asked me to marry him .
what ?
joey proposed to me .
is he crazy ? you just had ross &apos; baby !
well , i said yes .
what , are you crazy ? you just had ross &apos; baby !
i &apos;m sensing you won &apos;t throw the shower ?
it &apos;s so inappropriate . no , it is worse than that . it is wrong .
it is bigger than mine !
i know . days of our lives , thank you very much .
you can &apos;t marry him .
why not ?
come on , i don &apos;t want to do this alone , and he &apos;s such a sweet guy .
and he loves me so much .
well , do you love him ?
sure .
sure ?
yeah , i mean , whatever .
if you &apos;re worried about breaking his heart , it &apos;s still broken from the last time .
so really , you &apos;re just taking the already broken pieces ..
and breaking them into smaller , more manageable pieces .
okay , forget that .
honey , the question is ..
do you really want to marry joey ?
no .
no , i don &apos;t .
could you be a dear and go tell him ?
you still haven &apos;t told rachel you weren &apos;t proposing ?
no . she had the ring on ..
she seemed so excited , and then she took her breast out .
joey , you have to tell her what &apos;s going on . and what did it look like ?
i didn &apos;t look at it .
the stupid baby &apos;s head was blocking most of it .
go and tell rachel right now , before ross finds out .
look , it &apos;s not that easy . she said she wanted to marry me .
i don &apos;t want to hurt her .
okay , look , just do it gently .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;ll go tell her now before ross finds out , and i &apos;ll be gentle .
i can do that . i am a gentle person .
by the way , two people screwing in there if you want to check that out .
hey .
hey .
listen , i heard about the engagement .
surprised ?
and confused .
rach , sweetie ..
i didn &apos;t propose to you .
i know .
i don &apos;t think you do .
you didn &apos;t propose to me .
joey did .
poor baby , you &apos;re so tired .
rach , i didn &apos;t propose to you .
joey didn &apos;t propose to you .
and chandler didn &apos;t propose to you .
you didn &apos;t propose to me .
chandler didn &apos;t propose to me .
but joey did .
joey proposed to you ?
i can come back .
wait . wait . wait .
joey , did you propose to her ?
no .
yes , you did .
actually , technically , i didn &apos;t .
well , then , why did you give me a ring ?
wait .
you gave her the ring ?
no , and i did not ask her to marry me .
yes , you did .
no , i didn &apos;t .
yes , you did .
no , i didn &apos;t .
yes , you did , and don &apos;t you say you didn &apos;t !
he was right there . he got down on one knee and he proposed .
you were down on one knee ?
yeah , that looks bad .
but i didn &apos;t propose .
then what did happen ?
yeah , what did happen ?
okay , the ring fell on the floor , and i went down to pick it up ..
and you thought i was proposing .
yeah , but you said , &quot; will you marry me ? &quot;
no , i didn &apos;t .
yes , you did .
no , i didn &apos;t .
yes , you did . oh , my god , you didn &apos;t .
why didn &apos;t you tell me that before ?
well , i tried ..
but people kept coming in , and then you took your breast out .
you saw her breast ?
i &apos;ll tell you about it later . be cool .
then what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring ?
it wasn &apos;t my ring ! it &apos;s ross &apos; ring .
that &apos;s why i felt so bad , rach , because he was gonna propose .
what ? !
you were gonna propose to me ?
no .
well , this is awkward .
but i was going to see if , you know , maybe you wanted to start dating again .
but that , i mean , that was all , rach .
dude , step up . i proposed .
no , you didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s right . there &apos;s a lot going on here , and i think i ate some bad fruit earlier .
all right , so let me just get this clear .
you didn &apos;t propose .
you weren &apos;t gonna propose .
so this morning , i didn &apos;t have a boyfriend ..
and somehow i got dumped twice today .
hey , she just woke up . she &apos;s hungry . why don &apos;t we give this another try ?
here we go again .
i can &apos;t believe you told her i was gonna propose .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re not gonna .
hey , i am not gonna rush into anything .
yeah , dude , i totally understand .
usually after i have a baby with a woman , i like to slow things down !
oh , my god !
what ?
she &apos;s doing it ! she &apos;s breast @-@ feeding !
it &apos;s beautiful .
i &apos;ll come back for her later .
thank you .
wow , this feels weird .
what , good weird ?
wonderful weird .
you know what , you guys ? i &apos;m gonna go too .
and i &apos;m sorry about everything .
honey , don &apos;t worry , it was my mistake .
no , rach , i should &apos;ve told you sooner .
it &apos;s just that ..
man , that kid is going to town !
she &apos;s perfect .
we &apos;re so lucky .
we really are .
look , i know it &apos;s not a proposal , and i don &apos;t know where you are ..
but with everything that &apos;s been going on and with emma , i &apos;m ..
i &apos;ve been feeling ..
yeah , i know .
i &apos;ve been feeling ..
yeah ?
yeah .
okay , well , that .. wow , okay , well ..
then maybe at least we can talk about us again ?
yeah . maybe .
well , good . okay .
i kind of think , you know , if we , if ..
you &apos;re wearing the ring .
what &apos;s that ?
and you told phoebe you were engaged .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
when you thought joey proposed ..
did you say yes ?
kids , i spoke to a doctor and picked up these pamphlets on how to get pregnant .
hey , dad .
hi .
sorry to bother you again , but could you pass my pamphlets back ?
