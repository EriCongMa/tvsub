taxi !
carpe diem .
that was hell .
actual physical hell .
i think i went a tad overboard .
how annoying is carpe diem ?
a lot overboard .
they took something from me .
yeah , that wasn &apos;t an exam . that was an interrogation .
like , way ... way overboard .
the mind games .
trick questions .
it felt like al qaeda in there .
how are you supposed to plan a life ,
a career , a family ,
if you &apos;re always carpe @-@ ing the diem ?
next test is june .
june &apos;s not bad .
2013 .
what &apos;s done is done .
let &apos;s just not even talk about it anymore .
if we all seized every moment of every day ,
there wouldn &apos;t be doctors .
who would sit through med school ?
anyone know how alex did ?
anyone know if alex made it ?
made it ?
what do you mean , made it ?
we &apos;d all be too busy ...
living in the now .
whatever that means .
you okay ?
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m not sure .
i @-@ i hope you &apos;re not worried about last night .
i &apos;m not worried about last night .
i &apos;m worried because i checked with some of my friends
on the committee , and ...
one of your seattle grace doctors
didn &apos;t pass .
any idea who ?
they weren &apos;t sure .
but if it &apos;s jackson ,
he &apos;ll blame me forever .
welcome to the american medical board of surgery
certifying examination .
we &apos;ll give you four separates scenarios
in three 30 @-@ minute sessions ,
10 @-@ minute breaks in between .
to pass the test , you must pass two of the three sessions .
you can fail a sesson , and still--
pass .
but the examiners are not permitted to indicate
whether you passed or failed each session .
you &apos;ll be rated on your ability to diagnose
manage treatment , handle the unexpected ...
basicly the strength of your constitution in crisis .
and when we move on to the , uh , next scenario ,
the--the--there &apos;s no-- doubling back .
meaning , once a question is asked--
you can &apos;t go back . understood , sir .
are you in a hurry , dr.-- yang ?
no , sir . just ... ready when you are .
so then ,
a 65 @-@ year @-@ old woman
is being seen by her primary care physician
for workup of osteoporosis
when she is found to have elevated calcium .
her p.t.h. level was well above normal .
her doctor sends her to you .
elevated calcium and p.t.h.
would indicate primary hyperparathyroidism .
i would offer the patient a para ...
thyroidectomy .
at first , i would explore the right side .
if that gland is large ...
i would biopsy it .
um , after doing the biopsy , i would ...
hang--hang on , what @-@ what did the pathology &apos;s report say ?
path comes back with parathyroid hyperplasia .
and how large was the gland ?
how much longer are we gonna give this dr. karrev ?
15 ?
next , i would resect it and explore the other glands .
aggressive choice .
well , i suppose i could wait for the i.p.m.
before taking further actions .
are you sure you &apos;re okay with that ?
yes , i &apos;m okay with that .
if the i.p.m ...
showed p.t.h. levels in the normal range ...
dr. grey ?
i would feel comfortable concluding the procedure .
dude , there &apos;s no other way ?
helicopter . magic carpet .
that lane is open .
that &apos;s the bus lane .
i don &apos;t see any buses .
i &apos;ll get a ticket .
come on , man . i &apos;ll give you double any ticket .
what about my insurance ?
come on , man . just take the bus lane .
nah .
how far are we ?
20 blocks , give or take .
catch the game last night ?
come on . move .
i heard it went 11 innings .
move ! move . look out .
move . come on . come on .
okay , who wants more pancakes ?
you haven &apos;t had any . sit down .
i can &apos;t sit still . he &apos;s taking his test right now .
it &apos;s cute , you being nervous for jackson .
you want some more juice ?
it &apos;s paternal . you &apos;re a natural father .
are you sure you don &apos;t want anything ?
i could make some bacon--
we should have a baby .
don &apos;t freak out .
i @-@ i mean , i like ... this .
i like you ,
i like your kid ,
and i like your kid &apos;s moms .
and i ...
you--you know , you--you don &apos;t have to say anything right now .
just g @-@ go back to worrying about jackson ,
and we--we can talk about this later .
um , i would say no rush , but , you know ,
actually , my f.s.h. levels would suggest that
rushing a little might not be the worst thing in the world .
julia wants to have a baby with mark .
oh , i can &apos;t even deal with that right now .
wow .
i should &apos;ve picked him up myself .
i mean , i-- what &apos;s wrong with me ?
okay , i thought he was
your brother &apos;s best friend , not yours .
we were all super close ,
and he was my rock when tim died .
i just--oh , god . i let my rock take a cab .
oh , so you let him take a cab .
well , i mean , listen , he just flew in from tibet
and he has cancer .
i mean , the least i could do
is pick him up at the baggage claim .
hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , okay , you need to chill out .
look , i know that you &apos;re worried ,
but as far as cancers go ,
i mean , his is very slow growing .
he told you he found out , what , six months ago ?
i mean ... he could be fine .
yeah .
yeah .
well , with you in the o.r. , i &apos;m not worried .
you &apos;re gonna love him , and he &apos;s gonna love you .
well , i &apos;m taking his tumor out . it &apos;s the least he could do .
phoenix !
nick !
oh , it &apos;s good to see you .
ohh . wait . what &apos;s with the cane ?
tumor , man . it hurts to walk .
already ? but you were only diagnosed six months ago .
did i say months ? i meant years .
so ... you must be the wife .
yeah .
good to meet you .
good to meet you , too .
julia went all f.s.h. on me this morning .
is that a sexual term ?
you know what ? never--you know what ? i don &apos;t want to know .
she wants a baby . she wants my baby .
what did you say ?
nothing . it &apos;s crazy .
until you think about it and realize it &apos;s kind of genius .
i love julia .
i want sofia to have some siblings to grow up with .
why wouldn &apos;t i do it ?
are you asking me if you should have a baby ?
well , you think i shouldn &apos;t ?
have a baby or ask me if you should have a baby ?
so you think i should do it ?
well , do you want julia to be in your life forever ?
you think i shouldn &apos;t do it ?
uh , do you have to answer that right now ?
hey . answer what ?
we were just talking about the , uh , cranioplasty .
oh . it &apos;s exciting , right ?
yeah .
charlie konner , 37 .
uh , he fell off the roof six months ago .
he presents for repair of
a skull bone defect that occurred secondary to
surgical removal of part of his skull .
um , we waited several months for the swelling
to s @-@ subside before--
wh--uh , what--what were you doing , um , anyway ?
being an idiot .
b--you gonna fix it next time ?
no , i want the roofers to fix it next time
like they had to do it this time
because humpty @-@ dumpty almost killed himself .
wh--you want to pay for it ?
okay , we have mirrored
the healthy skull ...
and created a custom titanium plate
that we will secure to the bone .
titanium . like the terminator .
and i &apos;ll take fat from the belly and fill in the gaps ,
pull your face into shape .
so , doc , what are you using
to fasten the new skull into place ,
hexagonal screws ?
yes .
you know your stuff .
yeah , we could do this in my garage , save me a few grand .
you got a 2 @-@ millimeter bit ?
do i have a 2 @-@ millimeter bit ?
please don &apos;t encourage him .
what ?
no .
i am counting on you to treat these candidates extremely well .
show them whatever they want to see .
really woo them .
woo ?
yeah , woo . you know , uh--
what about me says &quot; woo &quot; ?
after the boards , we might be losing
some very good doctors to other programs .
now if that happens , we need to be sure
that we have some fresh talent
ready and willing to take their place ,
so i am asking you ,
as chief , please woo their socks off .
for you , just this once ,
i will woo .
uh , their socks off ?
d @-@ don &apos;t push it .
hi .
hey .
hey , um ,
so , uh ... do you have any word
on what cristina &apos;s plans are for next year ?
no . no , not yet .
oh . oh , okay .
um ... will you keep me posted ?
i will .
good . thanks .
the first session was so easy .
i want to punch your face .
hey .
hi . i am , uh ,
so , so sorry to interrupt .
i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m dr. karev .
i was stuck in seattle with a patient . and ...
well , i don &apos;t want to bore you with a bunch of travel crap--
your time was set for 9 : 00 this morning .
we were here . we called your name .
yeah , i was with a patient . you get that .
we all have patients , dr. karev ,
yet , here we were .
so what , i @-@ i @-@ i just fail ?
the first of three sessions , yes ,
which means you need perfect scores in the next two sessions .
how are you everywhere ?
how &apos;d it go for you in there ?
look , baby , i know you were shocked .
shocked ?
shocked at the sight of my mother half naked
with a senior attending at my hospital ?
no , far from it . okay ?
i mean , it &apos;s kind of par for the course for you ,
right , mom ?
but every door that i open ,
every--every corner that i turn ,
there you are .
i know i &apos;m your mother , but i &apos;m also a woman .
i have needs .
if you don &apos;t want to talk about this like an adult ,
don &apos;t bring it up .
wait a second . did i bring it up ? did i bring it up ?
don &apos;t play games . just talk to me .
just leave me alone !
i &apos;m in the middle of my freakin &apos; boards .
are you following me , mom ?
i &apos;m the examiner in the room right next to yours .
of course you are .
after that , i might mobilize the small intestine
to create a roux @-@ en @-@ y ,
and open up the pancreatic duct
longitudinally from the tail to the neck ?
the patient has died .
moving on to the next scenario .
um , can we--can we go back
just--just for a second ?
we &apos;re moving on , dr. kepner .
a 38 @-@ year @-@ old male with a history ...
but--but if we could just go back ,
just for one second so that i can clarify .
you have a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man
who complains of rectal pain and burning with defecation
and occasionally some blood in the bowel movement .
i would do a rigid sigmoidoscopy
to make sure there were no lesions in the rectum .
squeamish , dr. grey ?
no , not at all .
good , then let &apos;s pick up the answers , shall we ?
of course .
if there were lesions in the rectum ,
i would do an incisional biopsy ...
and begin to fulgurate ...
i would cover the bowel with omentum
and close the fascia primarily .
the sutures tear right through the fascia .
in that case , i would use 1 @-@ 0 nylon retention sutures
through the full thickness of the abdominal wall .
moving on .
because i would make sure the area
was adequately drained and closed--
dr. kepner--
because if it leaked , and if the leak was early ,
i would re @-@ explore the patient and repair the leak ,
making sure that if-- that if--
once a question is finished , it &apos;s finished .
finished . yes , i know . i &apos;m sorry .
i just really need you to understand
that if the leak was late , i would obtain an abdominal c.t.
just to make sure , and also , if it wasn &apos;t--
if it wasn &apos;t drained-- god .
um , can you hang on just for a second ?
it &apos;s just so incredibly hot in here .
ohh ! oh , god .
oh , god .
can we move on , dr. kepner ?
would you allow us the courtesy ?
yes .
yes .
great . thank you .
now a 38 @-@ year @-@ old male with a history of diabetes--
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . just--just--just--
just--just one last thing going back to the beginning ,
&apos;cause you-- you heard what i said
about finding the pancreatic duct , right ?
because i just--i really want to make sure you know
that i would drain the anastomosis , r--
well , i @-@ i--that patient should be stable !
they just ...
why won &apos;t you tell me ? just--just--just tell me !
how am i supposed to answer this question
without the full information ?
please t--
look , i &apos;m--i &apos;m , um ,
i &apos;m--i &apos;m a really good doctor . i am .
i just--i need--
i need all the information .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m a really good doctor .
um , no free air .
the spleen ...
the spleen looks fine .
there is some perihepatic fluid ...
i &apos;m sorry . are you guys hearing this noise next door ?
it &apos;s very distracting .
if we could just ask them to ... keep it down .
if you get distracted this easily ,
i think it calls to question your ability to function
in a high @-@ volume o.r.
certainly calls it into question .
it is not that at all .
okay ? it &apos;s just my--
never mind .
let &apos;s wait for traffic to die down .
we wouldn &apos;t want to throw you off your game , dr. avery .
i &apos;m fine . let &apos;s just--
i would stop the patient &apos;s continuous bleeding
with a portacaval shunt .
your patient is now in a coma .
that &apos;s highly unlikely , but , uh , in that case ,
i would suspect a hepatic encephalopathy
and check an ammonia level to confirm .
i &apos;ll save you the trouble .
it &apos;s confirmed .
i would check the patient &apos;s medication--
medication--
okay ,
then i &apos;d start on lactulose and neomycin .
the patient--
still not getting better ?
then i would do a shunt revision with a stent graft .
stent graft ?
yes , a stent graft .
well ...
risky move , dr. yang .
well ...
moving on .
did you have something to add , dr. yang ?
nope . all good .
does that hurt ?
nope .
what about--
yeah . that &apos;s what happens
when you wait six years to get treated .
so she &apos;s not shy .
yeah , i know . i never went for shy .
i &apos;ve been working with a naturopath .
i figured i &apos;d try the nontraditional route .
it helped .
it did .
but the pain started to kick up ,
so i saw a real doctor .
and he was gonna send me to an orthopedic surgeon ,
but then i was like , &quot; hold up .
yuma robbins just married one of those . &quot;
not that it was a real wedding .
excuse me ?
oh , um , she thinks you &apos;re serious .
oh , i am serious . tucson &apos;s already married .
to him .
she loves me .
we were 10 , it was in my tree house ,
and we had rings made of crabgrass .
you &apos;re probably the last guy i ever kissed .
it was a beautiful ceremony . tim officiated , her brother .
he made me swear to stop pulling the streamers off of her bike .
it was an issue for a while .
i &apos;m a little concerned about how much pain you &apos;re in .
so i am going to order some new scans .
these are how old ?
9 , you know , maybe 12 months . i had to finish up a project
on the guys who carry all the tourists &apos; crap up k @-@ 2 .
with a cane ?
i stayed at base camp .
play through the pain , right ?
no .
anybody ?
is she always like that or am i dying ?
no , you are going to be fine ,
because she is a genius with a scalpel .
she &apos;ll be in and out , and you won &apos;t even know it .
and they &apos;re not even gonna use drugs .
nope , nope , just , um , chamomile tea .
you are so damn cute .
how does she get through a work day with you around ?
i don &apos;t know .
i forgot how much i missed you .
me , too .
and our surgical rotations often allow
flexibility to set aside consecutive days
for research projects and field work if necessary .
any questions ?
would i have to share an office ?
we don &apos;t h--
i &apos;ll have to check on that .
are parking spaces assigned for attendings ,
or do we have to , like , find our own ?
i &apos;ll have to check on that .
all right , we just need to screw this down
and then adjust it to fit .
well ...
mark said that i get to graft the fat .
how cool is that ?
yeah , that &apos;s cool .
i &apos;m gonna be your big brother for 30 seconds .
okay .
julia wants to have a baby with mark .
she what ? what did she say ?
well , i don &apos;t know .
what do you mean , you don &apos;t know ?
wh @-@ what did he say ? how did it go down ?
my 30 seconds of brotherly advice is over .
i gotta go check on a patient .
no , i--oh , does he want to do it ?
i mean , did it seem like he was excited about it ?
or does he seem like , &quot; that &apos;s an insane idea &quot; ?
because it is . yeah , you know what ? i ...
d--i hope you told him that it &apos;s an insane ... idea .
are all your questions gross ?
gross ? what do you mean , gross ?
uh , they keep asking me about bowels
and bloody stools ?
it &apos;s general surgery . what do you expect ?
you &apos;re not helping , at all .
my guy is a freakin &apos; fossil .
the last time he was in the o.r. ,
it was lit by candles .
maybe i &apos;ll just live in here , in this stall ,
in my filth ...
till i die .
sick woman in here . go away .
uh , i @-@ i really need to get in there .
sorry . closed for maintenance .
please let me in .
come back later !
hey , the applicants keep asking to see the gym .
should i show it to &apos; em ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t want the , you know , cobwebs
and sweaty menthol stench to scare them--
when did i become the advice columnist ?
touchy , touchy .
well , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just , no one can seem to make up their own mind today .
oh , people do make up their own minds .
they just need a little help getting there .
what do you mean ?
okay , if someone comes to me with a problem ...
yeah . i give them a metaphor .
a metaphor ?
a figure of speech which--
yes , i know what a metaphor is .
fantastic .
now the next time someone comes to you with a problem ,
you just give them a metaphor .
any kind of metaphor ?
see ? that &apos;s the beauty of it .
they &apos;ll draw some meaning from it ,
and it &apos;ll help them make the decision
they were gonna make in the first place .
i &apos;ll stick with being honest . thank you .
suit yourself , but when they take your advice
and it doesn &apos;t work out ,
honesty can bite you in the ass .
if you don &apos;t mind , it is a men &apos;s room .
what ? what ? you &apos;re supposed to be doctors .
i &apos;ve seen your things . you &apos;ve seen mine .
it &apos;s all just flesh and cartilage . get over it !
april , wh --
oh , hey , jackson . how &apos;s it going ?
not so good . you ?
i am dying in there .
i am actually failing .
you , too ? &apos; cause mine is a total fiasco .
they think i &apos;m insane !
oh , they &apos;re toying with me .
i am self @-@ destructing into a puddle of sweat .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with me .
oh , i know exactly what is wrong with me
and i still can &apos;t reel it in .
i broke my promise to jesus
and now i can &apos;t even talk to him a @-@ and i need him .
he &apos;s the only one who can calm me down !
why the hell did you do it ?
why &apos;d you let me ?
i don &apos;t know !
you said it was okay .
i know !
i knew you &apos;d regret it !
stop yelling ! why are you yelling at me ? !
because i &apos;m all messed up now , too .
i mean , what am i ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m now the guy that made you
break your promise to jesus ?
i am not that guy ! all right ?
that guy is gross . okay ?
it &apos;s all very unbecoming , especially for an avery .
what ?
are you -- are you honestly comparing
breaking my promise to jesus
with putting a tiny dent in your family crest ?
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re right , and i &apos;m sorry .
my mom
is the examiner in the room right next to mine .
it &apos;s throwing me .
oh , god .
i know .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- i &apos;m worried about my mom
and what she &apos;s gonna think if i fail .
it &apos;s pathetic .
right ?
no . god , no , jackson .
it &apos;s not pathetic .
that &apos;s the most important relationship in your life .
the problem isn &apos;t ...
that i broke my promise .
that &apos;s not the problem .
the problem is ...
the problem is ...
that it felt good .
it felt good .
i shouldn &apos;t have taken advantage .
taken advantage ?
what ?
oh , we should -- we should go .
taken advantage ?
i kissed you , remember ?
yeah , but i kissed you back .
yeah , but then i unbuttoned your shirt .
yeah , and then i ...
pulled up that skirt .
yeah , but then i kissed your neck .
yeah .
and then i took off your shirt .
and i ...
but then i unbuckled your belt .
and then ...
i slipped my hand up your back .
and i wrapped my arms around your neck .
and then i ...
then you ...
then i ...
oh , no . he &apos;s not gonna ...
oh , yes , he is .
oh ! oh , no , no .
oh , my god .
i told you .
disgusting .
dr. bailey , where are the candidates ?
oh , over there destroying my appetite .
you know , i never thought i would &apos;ve said this ,
but we need to keep our people , people .
mm @-@ hmm . right ?
we haven &apos;t put in all this training
and put up with all their nonsense
to go groveling at the feet of bread sniffers .
kepner &apos;s already gotten job offers
at four different programs .
well , grey &apos;s not going anywhere .
not without yang anyway .
cristina has options .
my contact in boston
may have mentioned that meredith said
their program &apos;s her first choice .
you &apos;re building a house .
harvard has an excellent neurosurgery department .
w --
and they have plenty of really nice houses .
don &apos;t be all cryptic and then just walk away .
meredith ?
uh , i lied to you .
about what ?
i &apos;m not okay .
i might be dying . i think our daughter tried to kill me
with her flu for being a bad mother .
why didn &apos;t you tell me before ?
i &apos;m failing , derek ,
and i -- and i @-@ i don &apos;t think i can go back in there .
i just can &apos;t ... i mean ...
will you still love me if i fail ?
you want me to yell at you or tell you to come home ?
i want you to tell me what to do .
the test is a mirror .
what are you talking about ?
the test ... it &apos;s a mirror .
reflecting my sickly incompetence ?
are you saying i won &apos;t like myself
if i give up right now ,
that i won &apos;t be able to look myself in the mirror if i quit ?
whatever you decide , i will still love you .
no , you won &apos;t . nobody loves a quitter .
good luck , meredith .
you find out the patient
has advanced metastatic disease and is terminal .
what do you do ?
honestly ?
i &apos;d pray for them .
i know that &apos;s not the right answer ,
but it &apos;s what i &apos;d do first .
or at least if you asked me yesterday ,
that &apos;s what i &apos;d do .
now i &apos;m not so sure if he &apos;s listening .
dr. kepner , this is highly inappropriate .
yeah , well , so is having premarital sex
in the men &apos;s room with a really good friend ,
but that just happened , so ...
you know , i have been surrounded by scientists
for a decade now ,
holding back my feelings about my relationship with god
&apos;cause i was afraid of being laughed at
or judged or considered less of a doctor .
i was hiding ,
ashamed to admit that i love him ,
that his is the one relationship i count on .
and now-- now i &apos;m not sure
if i just screwed that up
or freed myself from its limitations . i ...
the one thing i know for sure , though , is ...
i think i &apos;m done hiding .
dr. kepner , we asked you a question .
yes , i would do a palliative endoscopic stenting .
if that failed and the patient was still alive and having pain ,
i would do a biliary @-@ enteric bypass .
after that , i might ...
a 30 @-@ year @-@ old female comes in with third @-@ degree burns .
you &apos;ve checked her airway and started fluid resuscitation
with d @-@ 5 n.s. fluids .
actually , i would use l.r. for fluid resuscitation ,
not n.s.
uh , saline has too much chloride ,
and that could cause acidosis in my patient .
okay .
so you &apos;ve started your patient on a liter of l.r.
thanks for assisting , bailey .
you know , nick did
a big spread in &quot; national geographic &quot; once
on this school for orphan girls in calcutta ,
and he--he sent them a bunch of cameras .
i think that it was polaroids .
so they wouldn &apos;t have to pay for the film to get processed ...
but anyways , you know , a couple of those girls
actually became photographers .
like professionals . isn &apos;t that amazing ?
we &apos;re not going to kill your friend .
what ? i know . i &apos;m just--i &apos;m saying ...
hey , does he save puppies , too ?
less sarcasm . a little more focus .
oh , shoot .
we were supposed to
bring snack today to the day care
for all the kids .
today ?
yeah , that mom from psych asked if we would switch with her ,
and i said we would , and then i forgot .
you need to write this stuff down . i--
i know . i know . i am so sorry . i ...
sorry .
you didn &apos;t forget snack today , did you ?
no , i &apos;m seeing mets in the vessels . look at this .
damn . and if they &apos;re here ...
they &apos;re gonna be everywhere .
the temporalis muscle is atrophied .
any idea why , dr. grey ?
uh , lack of use ?
it had nowhere to attach since the bone was gone .
that &apos;s right . it &apos;s too late for this muscle .
it &apos;s missed its chance to attach .
why are we talking about the temporalis ?
teachable moment , dr. sloan . stay out of it .
once you inject the fat into charlie &apos;s temple ,
the muscle will--
again with the muscle ?
yeah , the once healthy muscle
will slowly wither to nothing .
all alone ,
surrounded by a thick layer of fat .
very crafty , dr. shepherd .
message received ,
loud and clear .
they had snack .
and now i have 2 pounds of strawberries for no reason .
why--why is teddy here ?
oh , honey .
we did a pet @-@ scan , and , um ...
nick has intradural mets .
they &apos;ve spread into his lymph nodes .
they &apos;ve even gone into his heart .
he has a cardiac tumor , which looks like
it might have invaded into the right ventricle .
at this point ,
there &apos;s very little that we can do .
i @-@ i would be concerned about crohn &apos;s disease
but differential diagnosis could be p.u.d. ,
ulcerative colitis , or appendicitis .
dr. grey ?
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t--
i &apos;d locate the fistula endoscopically ,
then inject fibrin glue .
what about an abscess ?
what about it ?
well , apparently , you have ruled it out .
it just feels a bit ... cavalier , doesn &apos;t it ?
if you say so .
i &apos;m having a hard time understanding
why i would open her up when i could treat it endoscopically .
precisely my question , dr. yang .
i &apos;ve treated this condition a dozen times .
and i a thousand times .
if you would rather i open her up
and do tube duodenostomy ,
that &apos;s ... fine , too .
it &apos;s more invasive , but fine .
mm @-@ hmm .
dr. grey .
dr. grey , we &apos;re gonna have to call this .
you can take the exam again next year .
and we won &apos;t--we won &apos;t count this as a failure
so please--
okay , you &apos;re doctors .
you can &apos;t handle a little vomit ?
dr. grey , it-- it &apos;s really okay--
i would repair it with an abdominal approach ,
reduce the size of the hernia contents ,
excise the sac , close the hiatus ,
and perform a floppy nissen for antireflux and gastropexy .
but ask me something else ,
because i &apos;ve known that answer since i was , like 12 years old .
my mother practically invented the floppy nissen .
so keep them coming , but don &apos;t go easy on me .
all right . a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man presents
with a suspicious lesion on his left temporal ,
sent in by his in--
pigmented lesion ?
you seem awfully sure of yourself .
i &apos;m sorry . is that a question ?
do you feel threatened ?
oh , have we moved on to psychology ?
i find your hostility curious .
and i &apos;m curious as to why you think me hostile .
you know , if you don &apos;t agree with my approach ,
i wish you would voice your issues .
i @-@ i don &apos;t disagree .
i don &apos;t believe you .
are you calling me a liar , sir ?
fine . you know what ?
earlier when i said i was okay with that open procedure ,
i wasn &apos;t .
that might have been okay when , like ,
hawkeye and b.j. did it on &lt; i &gt; mash &lt; / i &gt; ,
but this being the new century and all ,
i would have , as i said earlier , treated it endoscopically .
then you lied earlier .
you know what ? oh , god .
i can answer these questions any way you want
using medical techniques from any era .
so how about we just ,
you know , pick a decade you &apos;re comfortable with
and go from there ?
well , then ...
it &apos;s been a pleasure being witness to such genius .
i can now finally retire
knowing that such advanced and creative minds
are at work in the surgical field , hmm ?
that &apos;s it ?
oh , i think we &apos;ve had enough of an education today ,
dr. yang .
but ... there &apos;s still 20 minutes .
no need .
best of luck .
i &apos;d do a biopsy .
path shows l.c.i.s.
what &apos;s your best mastectomy approach ?
i &apos;d make a periareolar incision
to preserve the inframammary fold .
but wait . did you say l.c.i.s. ?
yes , lobular carcinoma in situ .
you wouldn &apos;t do a mastectomy .
you &apos;d observe and repeat mammos .
you already did a skin sparing mastectomy .
that was a trick question .
you had all the facts to answer .
yeah , but my answer was wrong .
i &apos;m gonna fail because of a trick question ?
the questions are designed to get your response--
you gotta be kidding me ?
you missed your first session .
you &apos;re lucky to be even getting this chance .
yeah , i missed my first session
for the best freakin &apos; reason .
i was with a patient .
for months with this kid who--who doesn &apos;t have a chance ,
not a chance .
and we give them a chance and we try everything ,
and then when there &apos;s nothing left to do ,
i &apos;m supposed to just walk away
from his mother ?
i had to be there . i had to .
and what-- what did i miss here ,
a few more hypothetical trick questions ?
what are you staring at ?
you guys are doctors .
you &apos;re supposed to decide if i &apos;m gonna be a doctor ,
and you can &apos;t understand that ?
thank you , dr. karrev .
it &apos;s karev .
can you at least tell me if i passed ?
thank you .
thank you .
taxi .
well , you--you don &apos;t want to miss your flight .
no , i don &apos;t want to miss my flight .
i better go .
richard , i don &apos;t regret last night
one bit .
neither do i.
it &apos;s just bad timing .
you know , we live in different cities .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s too complicated right now .
yeah , bad timing .
bye , richard .
bye , catherine . safe flight .
oh , uh , call me if you hear any more about the boards .
oh , i will , and call me when you get home ,
let me know you got there okay .
i will .
are ... you going to
the trauma and critical care conference in may ?
in new orleans ?
i &apos;m speaking at it .
me , too .
i &apos;m at the sonait house . where are they putting you up ?
windsor court .
oh , no . sonait house is much better .
the breakfast biscuits will make you jump up and down .
when do you fly in ?
uh , i think it &apos;s thursday .
i fly in thursday , too .
i can &apos;t believe it .
my whole charlie is back .
you people are miracle workers .
so how long till i &apos;m back on the ladder ?
i @-@ i just got a tile saw ...
and i &apos;m gonna mosaic the stucco .
you ca--dr . shepherd , talk some sense into him .
it &apos;s really not my place .
but if you want to say something to your husband ,
please , by all means , you should do it .
i know how much you love to work on the house ,
but listen to me , you are clumsy .
and i can &apos;t stand the thought of almost losing you again .
so would you just take a second
and what &apos;s left of your brain
and think about how i felt about it ,
how scared i was to lose you forever ?
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry , babe .
i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll find a new hobby .
something we can do together , like , uh , bowling .
oh , no , um , i-- i hate bowling .
but you never even tried it .
well , you can hate something without trying it .
thanks , uh , for today .
for--for letting me , uh ...
you did a good job in there .
thanks .
you okay ?
i love you .
oh , g--oh , my god . that just came ...
fly @-@ flying out of my face
like it was s @-@ s @-@ some kind of--
i @-@ i i @-@ i love you .
i just--god .
did it again .
i ... i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i love you .
i @-@ i do . i just-- i @-@ i love you .
and i have been trying not to say it .
i have been trying so hard to just mash it down
and ignore it and not say it .
and jackson is a great guy .
he--he is , and he-- he &apos;s gorgeous ,
and--and he &apos;s younger than you ,
and he doesn &apos;t have any grandkids
or @-@ or babies with his lesbian b.f.fs.
and he &apos;s an avery , and--and he liked me , you know ?
he ... he really liked me .
but it was never gonna work out
because i @-@ i love you .
i am so in love with you .
and you &apos;re--you &apos;re-- you &apos;re in me .
it &apos;s--you &apos;re like--it &apos;s-- it &apos;s like you &apos;re a disease .
it &apos;s like i am infected by mark sloan .
and i just can &apos;t--
i can &apos;t think about anything or anybody ,
and i can &apos;t sleep .
i can &apos;t breathe .
i can &apos;t eat .
and i love you . i just-- i love you all the time ,
just every minute of every day .
and i @-@ i @-@ i--
i @-@ i ...
love you .
god , that feels good , just to--to say that--
to j--i am--
i feel so much better .
just ... i love you .

hey there , sunshine .
you feeling okay ?
yeah . you know , just groggy .
you guys got good drugs in this place .
good . what the hell were you thinking ?
dude--
you &apos;re an idiot .
you should have called me .
i mean , wh @-@ why didn &apos;t you call me ? i &apos;m a doctor .
what do you think i do all day long ?
instead you go to some quack in tibet .
i mean , you should &apos;ve freakin &apos; called me !
naturopathy works , too , flagstaff .
whoa . it &apos;s not flagstaff !
and it &apos;s not phoenix and it &apos;s not tempe .
it &apos;s arizona robbins , m.d.
do you know what that means ?
how do you spell it ?
it &apos;s not funny , nick .
nothing is funny . you &apos;re dying !
and you know what hell it was when tim died
because you were there ,
and--and you and i barely made it through that .
so to do nothing for six years
and then to come when it &apos;s too late ,
i ... i ...
why do you think i didn &apos;t come to you sooner ?
as if after tim died , i could ...
you think i don &apos;t know how this must feel for you ?
you &apos;re an idiot !
i couldn &apos;t have helped tim , but i could &apos;ve helped you !
i &apos;ll admit , the romans had a point .
you &apos;ve gotta live life .
gotta pee . gotta pee . gotta pee . gotta pee . gotta pee .
what time you got ?
12 : 04 .
it &apos;s supposed to come online at midnight .
i mean , it &apos;s four minutes late . come on , people .
crazy doctors , they crashed the system .
i already know i failed , so i don &apos;t know why
i keep hitting the refresh button .
and living means that every morning when you wake up
you have to choose ...
okay , if anyone failed , was me ,
because my guy had a vendetta .
please . i &apos;ve got the odds on failure .
are any of you on call ? i &apos;ve got a trauma .
no !
wait . wait . wait .
i passed . i passed .
i passed ! i passed ! i passed ! yes !
i passed ! i passed !
between seizing what life offers in the moment
and forging ahead , no matter the weather ...

or closing the curtains ...
