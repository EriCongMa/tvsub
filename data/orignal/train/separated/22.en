The Good Wife S01E05
An hour ago, I resigned the State's attorney of cook county.
Dad told us he made mistakes.
Yeah, but not that.
Who first told you of your husband's infidelity, Mrs. Florrick?
CNBC. I saw it on the crawl at the bottom of the screen.
I'm glad you're making A life for yourself.
It gives you a break.
Well, I just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity.
It's a real lifesaver.
No. Glad you could come aboard.
Looks like we share an assistant,
So tell me when I'm hogging her, okay?
And let the best man win.
You told him peter was lonely in prison.
Because he is.
Just don't go around me by talking to my kids.
Jackie, it'll just have to wait until next week.
But peter's expecting them for his birthday.
Peter and I agreed I'd bring the kids next week.
Their first visit is a big deal. I want to do it right.
And so, you need me for how many nights late?
Just a couple, And I shouldn't be too late...
11:00 or so.
What do you want me to tell Zach and Grace?
Tell them I love them, and I will call them tonight.
And Peter? What do I tell him?
Jackie...
Okay, then. Bye.
There she is.
Alicia, Marne Compton.
Hi.
Hi.
Bowdoin, 2005. Summa cum laude.
She worked for three years at Kaplan & Cohick?
Personal assistant to Mr. Cohick.
Oh. Why'd you leave?
There was an opportunity With habitat for humanity
Building an orphanage in Tijuana.
Peace Corps. Belize.
And you know we only have money for one assistant, Marne,
So we would have to share you.
Oh, yes. Don't worry.
I'm used to high-pressured environments. I like action.
To me, it's all about time management.
I know you're juggling three or four cases at once,
And it's my job to help catch any balls that get dropped.
I love your boots.
Where did you get them?
Oh, why thank you.
I got them at saks fifth avenue.
They have a sale now, and you can't believe the options.
Isn't she great?
Oh, yes.
So, should I make it happen?
Well, actually, let's bring in a few more people.
I'll make some calls.
Sure, but we should do this like voir dire or something.
Three peremptory challenges, you know?
Hey, did you hear about the rumors?
Stern is retiring.
Our Stern?
Yeah. We'll just be Lockhart, Gardner.
I saw this happen at my dad's firm--
Two partners losing a third.
It was like dawn of the dead.
People fighting over turf.
Junior associates lining up against each other.
Not us?
Oh, hey, I won't if you won't.
We have such a good working relationship.
Wow. They're still on the lakeshore crash?
I thought we settled that already.
Nope. Today.
That is our train.
It crashed. Your clients crashed it.
Do I need to use simpler sentences?
Yes, Patti. Please. I love it when you patronize me.
Cross National Freight
Entrusted your clients to drive our train.
They drove it too fast.
They derailed it, causing millions in damage.
Luckily, it was a freight train and nobody died.
Except our clients.
We should be suing you, and not you us.
Except for this nagging little problem, Patti.
That your company overworked my clients
With double-digit shifts and 18-hour days.
Oh, yes, the sexy overtime evidence.
Juries love that.
Except for the fact that my clients are heroes.
Except...
Yes?
Except for the fact That these three men stayed with your train.
To keep it from crashing into a residential neighborhood,
Saving untold lives.
Untold.
I love untold.
My bet is a jury will, too.
Will, we're not picking a jury tomorrow.
Judge Parks is a pro-business constructionist
Who detests nuisance lawsuits as much as I do.
He's going to grant my motion to dismiss, and you know it.
And I know you know it.
So what do you want?
Make me an offer.
Damn it, Alicia, I thought I said 3:00.
I'm sorry.
I love watching you, Will.
It's like shakespeare in the park.
This is awkward. I tried to keep it
So that you wouldn't cross paths with the widows.
Heartstrings-- Ouch, ouch-- being tugged.
What time is their 60 minutes interview?
5:00.
We may not need a jury.
But, hey, what do I know? It's just 60 minutes.
We know how much they love high-powered executives
And hate grieving widows, right?
Mr. Harkin, I'm putting you on speaker.
Uh, yeah, fine.
Even though it is my belief that we would win a countersuit
Against your clients for negligence,
We are willing to pay out their pensions for ten years.
Ten?! You kidding?
Does it come with double coupons?
Are you comfortable with that, Mr. Harkin?
No. 80 cents on the dollar.
You know, sir, these widows Are having trouble paying their rent.
What?!
One of them is about to lose their house.
She has three children.
What? Who is that?
I'll get him up to a dollar.
You get them to agree.
Ooh, I have yoga in half an hour.
After that, this deal is dead.
Their pension for ten years?
It's a come-out offer.
Anything?
Pension for ten years.
How much do we have in this?
Partner hours? 82.
Will they take it?
I don't know. I don't think so.
We're bleeding here.
Hey, what was that all about?
With Overby?
Oh, Malcolm? You know him?
He's an old friend. Just catching up.
So, uh, don't take a lot of time with it.
Just do a basic background check.
Malcolm's an old friend.
What am I looking for?
Stability.
Kalinda, one last thing.
I need you to keep this confidential.
I'll be splitting time with cross national freight.
I'm not sure that's possible.
Well, if will asks,
Just say I'm having you do work on Sheffrin-Marks.
I want an apology.
They worked my... Our husbands to death.
They tried to blame them for this accident,
And now they want to pay ten years on their pensions?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Underwood.
I don't want you to apologize.
I want them to apologize.
They don't apologize.
Money is their apology.
Well, I guess then they must not be very sorry.
I think we should take it.
I-I... I need the money.
I'm a month away from sleeping in my car.
My kids-- They still cry for their dad at night.
Look at these bills. I...
They're not even paying John's overtime.
Because they want to starve us into a settlement.
Let me talk to her again,
See what they come back with.
But I think we all know we're in the endgame here.
So, you've lost faith?
I believe cross national freight overworked your husbands
To the point of exhaustion.
I believe that's why the train crashed,
But I can't prove it.
And they can prove the train was moving too fast.
I'm sorry, Linda.
So, you still want these,
Denial of overtime claims?
Yes. Everything you have.
We're trying to build to a...
What?
Would you just give me a moment?
Alicia,
This offer is walking out the door in ten minutes.
What?
This is the memo in our discovery.
This is the same memo sent to our clients.
They left off three names.
You can go to yoga now.
We'll see you in court.
The bottom line is
Cross National Freight deliberately denied us discovery
By concealing Mr. Merriman and two other department heads.
Your honor, no one has been denied discovery here.
If names were left off documents, it was inadvertent.
Inadvertent? Is that what they're calling wite-out these days?
Your honor, that is just...
I'm sorry,
But I find Mr. Gardener's charges Personally offensive.
Mr. Merriman and these other two people
Have nothing to do with overtime.
Then why were they cc'd on a letter denying it?
Mr. Gardner, you don't have Enough here to convince a jury.
Your honor, with all due respect...
Don't all due respect me, counselor.
I'm not your high school gym teacher.
On the other hand, Ms. Nyholm--
Inadvertent, my ass.
Mr. Gardner, how long would it take to depose these witnesses?
To properly prepare and depose, I would say one month.
You have three days.
Three?
But, your honor, that isn't...
Now you have two days.
Want to try for one?
No, thank you, your honor.
Your honor, if I could just interject here.
These executives are very busy people.
Even two hours out of their work day...
Ms. Nyholm,
You just gave Mr. Gardner back his third day.
Would you like to give him a fourth?
No, your honor. I'll stop.
Good.
We'll meet back here on friday
To decide whether a dismissal is in order.
Does anybody have anything to say?
Okay.
Next case.
Cancel everything.
For the next 72 hours, we eat, drink and sleep this case.
I wanna bring you a birthday cake.
How's everything at home, mom?
Good.
She's working too much, but that's about it.
Alicia?
What did I say?
Every time you refer to Alicia, you say "she."
Do I?
Alicia came home last night at midnight,
Left this morning at 6:00.
I warned her about Diane Lockhart.
No, no, it's the other one, Will Gardner.
I mean, I'm glad they're friends and all,
But he needs to give her a break.
Day and night, she never stops.
Okay, so the goal is this.
I'll depose Merriman.
He's the VP of operations.
That's who I think Patti's hiding from us.
The other two-- What are their names?
Jonathan Eldredge and Sarah Conley.
He's a systems engineer, and she's in industry relations.
Okay, whatever you do, just keep the depos going.
Just keep asking questions
So judge Parks doesn't pull the plug on this.
Hopefully, I draw enough blood with Merriman,
They'll up their offer.
Remember, the point isn't to go back to court.
The point is to get them to open their wallets further.
And you're a mechanical systems manager.
Is that correct, Mr. Eldredge?
Yes.
And this says That you ordered a new public-address system
For passenger cars.
Could you explain?
Standard upgrade.
And this says you authorized a new coupling mechanism.
Is that right?
Yes. Standard upgrade.
And this says-- Let's see--
That you replaced the automated lrs,
"Load regulator system."
Standard upgrade.
Your rail traffic has doubled in the last decade,
But you've cut your crews in half, correct?
There's more automated equipment.
Trains are easier to drive.
And yet it still takes the same amount of time to drive them.
Let the record reflect
That Mr. Merriman shrugged.
Let the record reflect, I shrugged, too.
So, Ms. Conley, you're saying you have nothing to do
With approving or denying overtime?
That's right.
And what about David Merriman?
Has he ever approved or denied overtime?
I don't recall.
Did any of the accident victims work overtime
The week before the lakeshore crash?
I don't recall.
Did any of them routinely put in for overtime?
I don't recall.
Ms. Conley, are you married?
I don't re...
Oh, I'm so sorry, Ms. Conley.
I've got three clients who lost their husbands--
Must have been a freudian slip.
The truth is,
These three employees had gone 24 hours without rest
When this accident occurred.
No, no, they work hard, sure, but...
You worked them hard, didn't you?
I did my job, Mr. Gardner.
And what was your job, Mr. Merriman? Tell us.
We pay these people well-- We expect results.
You're a lawyer, you work people hard here at your firm?
You bet your ass you do. This is america.
You work hard, get the job done, whatever it takes.
I think we should take a break.
Definitely.
Let Mr. Merriman recompose himself.
This guy is a walking disaster.
No wonder they hid him from us.
You should've seen Patti.
She looked like she was ready to give birth right there.
How'd yours go?
Well, I know more about trains than I ever wanted.
Just keep it going.
Patti's on the phone with her overlords
Trying to up the offer.
If she does, can you get the widows on the line?
Yeah, Linda said she'd stay by the phone.
Thanks. You kept them together.
I know that hasn't easy.
Oh, I didn't do anything.
You can just tell us the number, Patti.
Have you ever known a fishing expedition to be free, Will?
Three more days for discovery--
That went both ways.
Oh, come on.
Our clients passed every company drug test...
Yes, but this wasn't the company's.
This was part of Underwood's application
To renew his health insurance, a week before the crash.
Amphetamines?
That's right.
Your client was on speed.
When I was first starting out, I, uh,
I got a terrific piece of advice,
And it's always stuck with me, and this is it.
Everything that happens in a courtroom...
Who did you say he was again?
Malcolm Overby.
Yeah, I think I've heard of him.
Back in the time of Clarence Darrow,
It was a common practice for people to smoke in the courtroom.
So, do you work with him?
Currently.
Rumor is he might be going to another firm.
I just hope he takes me with him.
...cuban cigar and he starts smoking...
Would you excuse me?
It's my mother.
I'll be right back.
What's up?
Cross National is throwing an insurance drug test at us for underwood.
Could you check it out?
Sure, but tomorrow.
Uh, what? Why? What's up?
Diane's asked me to do further work on Sheffrin-Marks.
She what?
I've gotta go.
I can tell from your face, it's not good.
The company has a drug test.
It says Jimmy had amphetamines in his system.
For the longest time
I didn't think there was evil.
I just thought there were people who did good and bad things.
But now...
Sorry.
That's the kind of conversation Jimmy and I would have.
Linda, I have to ask,
Did you know about this?
Alicia,
Jimmy never did drugs.
There's nothing to know about.
Go through your medicine cabinet.
Bring me every pill Jimmy's ever taken,
Every pill he could've accidentally taken of yours.
Could you do that?
Are we gonna win?
We're gonna fight.
Cole v. Wolensky.
"Judge may exclude drug test"
"If there's been a violation of testing procedure."
Judge Parks would rather eat his own foot
Than offer us relief on that.
Kalinda have any leads?
I...
No.
She's doing something with Diane.
For Diane? What?
Something for sheffrin-marks.
What?
We've got a power vacuum here.
It makes people do...
Interesting things.
Did she say anything about Malcolm Overby?
No.
Well, I'm giving up on law anyway.
I'm sick of it.
Back to the minors?
I could've been a contender.
I liked watching you pitch.
Yeah, I had some moments.
We're the last ones here.
Yep.
I should go.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Yeah?
Yeah, Mr. Gardener. There's a woman down here
Who insists on seeing Mrs. Florrick.
Oh, Ms. Conley,
Did you forget something?
I'm not here.
I have a family. I can't get messed up in this.
Okay. Let's talk.
No.
It's wrong what they're doing.
Blaming them with that drug test.
Blaming them for something they...
Something they...?
Newbury Heights.
Wait. What?
Newbury Heights.
I don't know what you mean.
Find out.
How old?
Oh, I'm so stupid.
I should've just shut up.
I should've just kept walking.
But that would've been wrong.
I thought you'd be different.
I thought after what you went through...
With your family...
And you come here to my house?
I'm sorry.
Then go.
I can't.
There are three mothers who are widows now, Mrs. Conley...
It's not my fault.
But it's somebody's fault.
What do you want?
I looked into Newbury Heights.
I couldn't find anything.
I went back 50 years.
There's never been an accident there.
It wasn't an accident.
It was a near miss.
And it wasn't one of our trains.
Right.
Coming into Newbury heights, there's a nine degree curve.
That's where we jumped the track.
Just managed to get the brake on before we hit the commuter train.
Did anyone from your company ever identify the problem?
Sure. Sure.
They identified me.
Said I was going too fast.
But the speed gauge never went above 32 mph.
I thought it was mechanical.
Maybe a faulty pressure sensor.
Isn't the pressure sensor part of the load regulator sensor?
Trains, you know.
Love them.
So, if you upgraded the lrs,
Wouldn't you have to replace the pressure sensor, too?
Yeah. Fact is, that's what they did,
After the near miss,
they upgraded the lrs.
Standard upgrade.
We've been going after the wrong thing--
Overtime records and not faulty equipment.
They erased those memos not to hide Merriman,
But the structural engineer, our buddy Eldredge.
If we can prove he was at newbury heights...
Yep. Previous knowledge. We'll have a case,
Even judge parks can't kick.
Here is the deal. We can't let patti know we're changing strategies.
I'll keep deposing Merriman.
You re-depose Eldredge.
Be ready in ten minutes.
Okay.
I think I have someone you'll be more comfortable with.
I worked 19 years as an assistant.
We called them secretaries in my day.
And are you comfortable with online research, Mrs. Plack?
Online?
Oh, yeah, everything's computers nowadays.
Don't worry, I'm a quick study.
Hey, I like your hair this way.
Yeah, I do.
It looked so dowdy on TV,
Pulled back like that.
But that must've been a hard day, huh?
What's the smoking policy here, anyway?
What? I thought you two would have a lot in common.
That does not count as a preemptory.
Oh, Mr. Merriman's is upstairs.
Yes, I thought I'd sit in on this one today.
Get to know you better.
Great.
Please.
Actually...
Chairs aren't really my friends these days.
I think I'll just stand.
So you're Will's new one?
Yes. I'm his new junior associate.
Yeah, that's what I meant.
The way you look actually..
I guess he finds you a challenge.
Too many blond gigglers,
And why not go for someone more substantial,
Someone with interesting history.
Mrs. Nyholm.
I know how this works--
We're going to try and get into each other's heads,
Try and unnerve each other.
Can I give you a little bit of advice?
After the past seven months, I'm vaccinated.
Fair enough.
Let's get started.
Mr. Eldredge, two months before the lakeshore crash,
You authorized an upgrade of the load regulator system
On all cross national freight trains.
Can you explain why?
There wasn't just one reason.
It was a change we'd planned for some time.
And what about the lrs in the train that crashed,
Did you replace that one?
I don't believe we did.
The-the upgrade takes some time,
And we couldn't have all of our engines out of commission at once.
I understand that.
Tell me about Newbury Heights,
Mr. Eldredge.
What?
Tell me about it.
It's, uh...
I don't know what you mean.
June 21, you went to Newbury Heights
To check out a near miss collision, isn't that right?
Would you like to take a break?
If you were to learn there was a problem
With a piece of equipment on your trains, Mr. Eldredge,
You'd replace the part, wouldn't you?
Of course I would.
And you'd make sure that
No trains were operating with unsafe equipment?
Look, I know what you're thinking.
No, you don't.
I never once...
My apologies.
We're gonna have to break this off here.
Oh, come on. Objection.
Let the record reflect
Deposition was suspended for medical reasons.
And again, I-I apologize.
Mr. Eldredge.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Hi, Jackie. It's me.
I saw that you called.
Dad.
Dad.
Zach?
It's you!
I... I missed you.
I know.
Grace.
Go to him.
Grace.
Happy birthday, dad.
So, you still a fish or what?
Yep, still a fish.
Just like in oz.
They do shakedowns every day?
Your honor, Will Gardner. This is my third message.
Defense counsel's interrupted deposition for the day and we...
Damn it.
He's lying.
What?
He knew exactly what Newbury Heights was.
He said he was in the office all day.
But you have to swipe that every time you exit and ente
Which means we can tell exactly
What time he came and went.
I can't get the judge on the phone,
But if I hurry, I'll catch him.
What are you doing?
Getting a court order
For Cross National Freight's security records.
Find kalinda, tell her to meet me down at the courthouse.
Oh, listen, I'll call you about that...
Diane has a boyfriend.
What's the occasion?
Work.
It's just so pretty.
Thank you.
What time did you get in?
Late. You were asleep.
Thanks, by the way.
This should be the last late night for a while.
I took Grace and Zach to see Peter.
You did what?
I took Grace and Zach to see their father for his birthday.
Jackie, I-I...
I-I'm thunderstruck.
I tried to phone you.
You tried to phone me?
We discussed this.
I was taking them next week.
It worked out perfectly, seeing him.
They were perfect.
Jackie.
I am their mother.
It is my decision.
This of all things is my decision!
I'm sorry. It was spontaneous.
You don't supervise my kids spontaneously.
You don't take them to prison.
You don't just try and phone me.
You phone me.
You respect me as a mother
or you leave.
I am doing the best I can.
Well, join the club.
Overby's firm is well capitalized,
Excellent client base,
No ethics charges,
No bankruptcies, no judgments.
But are you sure that's what you're looking for?
I... Don't know.
Should I be looking for something else?
Well, that's like asking a dentist
Whether you should brush.
See what you can find out.
And, Kalinda, again, this is just between you and me.
You understand?
Yeah.
Do you know how much you pay jury consultants?
No.
$100,000 for three months work.
That sounds about right.
Do you know how much I make?
I have a feeling I'm finding out.
A fourth of that.
That sounds outrageous.
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
Subpoenaed records of security entrances
From may to august.
Thanks.
So, Kalinda, can I ask you...
This thing you're doing with Diane,
Does it have anything to do with Malcolm Overby?
No.
It doesn't?
No, you can't ask me.
It's just...
If he's coming on as a third partner,
Will should know.
You can't ask me and I can't tell you
But don't conclude from what I'm saying it's what you think.
Okay.
Can you be any more specific?
No.
Wait, here's the date, june 21.
It would take him about two hours
To get out to Newbury Heights.
He leaves the office at 6:42 p.m.,
And he comes back...
An hour later.
That's not enough time.
What about the next day?
Same thing. 9:48 p.m.,
Comes back at 10:33 p.m.
Wait.
That's someone else.
Oh, you're right. That's Sarah Conley.
Oh, here he is.
Eldredge...
He left and came back a few minutes later.
That's interesting.
What?
Look.
See, here it is again.
Sarah Conley leaves within a few minutes of Eldredge,
She comes back a few minutes after him.
Same here, 9:30 p.m.
Me, too...
8:45 p.m.
And on august 5, the night of the lakeshore crash,
Same thing.
They're always the last two working together at night.
Yeah, well, so are we.
Yeah, but they're leaving and returning
Within a few minutes of each other on foot.
And you know what's across from their building?
The Stanford Plaza hotel.
I think they were having an affair.
Jonathan Eldredge is denying everything.
That's not my problem.
All the nights you went
To the hotel with him across the street,
That is your problem.
Oh, my god.
Sarah, I don't care about your personal life.
That's your business.
All I care about is what he said to you
The night of the accident, that's all.
He wanted to talk; he was so upset.
He said he knew for a while
There was a problem with the pressure sensor.
He'd been trying to fix it quietly.
Sarah, I need to demonstrate
That Eldredge knew about the problem
Before the accident.
But there's no document, there's no smoking gun,
And I don't have the time to find one.
All I've got is you.
I can't testify!
This isn't about the affair, Sarah.
This is about the accident.
The only way I know about the accident
Is because of the affair, and I will have to talk about it.
If I don't, they'll bring it up.
They'll say I'm getting back at him,
That I'm bitter.
You know how they'll twist this around.
There's no other way.
I'm sorry, hon. Dylan only wants you.
Is everything all right?
Yeah, fine.
I love you.
How old did you say Dylan was?
Three months.
It's not just me.
It's my husband, it's my other kids,
It's a baby.
They have nothing to do with this,
But if you make me testify...
Please don't do to me what somebody did to you.
Wow, you are really obsessed with him.
Not obsessed. Intrigued.
So, is he seeing anyone?
So that's what this is about.
You want me to introduce you?
No.
I was just...
Introduce whom?
Malcolm Overby.
Kalinda.
Kalinda what?
Kalinda Smith.
Uh, I'm a lawyer.
My firm threw this party.
What do you do?
I crash other people's parties.
So, if I gave you my card,
What are the chances you'd use it?
I'd say pretty good.
Use it however you want.
So, I take it you have some information.
Yeah.
I looked deeper into Mr. Overby,
And I don't think he's a good candidate for partnership.
Based on my investigation,
He appears to be nonexclusive.
Nonexclusive?
In pursuit of other options.
Openly in pursuit.
Are you sure?
Positive.
The firm can do better.
Well, thank you, Kalinda,
For your discretion in this matter.
Always.
Kalinda, let's talk tomorrow about renegotiating your contract.
I'd like that.
This is it.
Every pill in our medicine cabinet.
And this... This is a prescription Jimmy got
A month before the accident.
It's for allergies.
Do you think that could be it?
It could be.
The drug test didn't screen for pseudoephedrine.
Not in this dosage.
Thanks, Linda.
Have a good night.
You, too.
Was it frightening?
No.
I just... I don't like him in there.
I like seeing dad in a suit.
Yeah, me, too.
So, you're okay?
Yeah, I mean, I'm mad at him,
But he's still dad.
What about you?
You look sad.
No.
It's just this case I'm working on.
Might have to do something I don't want to.
Something?
You know, like what happened to us.
Well, you said "might."
Is there another way?
Not that I can think of.
Well, you're a lawyer, right?
You have to represent your client.
Even if it means hurting another family?
Well, if you didn't,
You'd just hurt your client, right?
You have to do your job.
You can't just not do your job.
So three days later, and you still
Have depositions to conduct?
Your honor, Ms. Nyholm stomped out
Of Mr. Eldredge's deposition
Two days ago, and we have been constrained
With questioning Mrs. Conley and Mr. Eldredge ever since.
As melodramatic
As Mr. Gardner's account is,
Your honor, I think the last time
I stomped out of anywhere was the third grade.
Unless I've grown bigger than I thought.
Uh, we ask, your honor,
For an open deposition, so that you may rule...
They're going to force her to testify in open court?
If she denies the affair,
They'll accuse her of perjury.
Then, everything she says
In court will get thrown out.
Who are you deposing?
Ms. Sarah Conley, your honor.
Please don't do this.
I'm so sorry.
Mrs. Conley, what did Mr. Jonathan eldredge
Tell you on the night of august 5,
A few hours after the lakeshore crash?
Objection, your honor.
No foundation.
Ms. Florrick has yet to establish access.
Your honor, do we need to establish access?
They work in the same company.
But in vastly different departments.
Sustained.
Ms. Conley, where were you on the evening of August 5
After the lakeshore crash?
I was in a hotel room downtown.
Were you alone?
No.
I was with Jonathan Eldredge.
Mr. Harkin, can... Can you hear us?
No, no, that's good enough.
Where is your assistant?
I don't know. She quit.
It's very hard to find a good assistant these days.
Mr. Harkin, I'm going to make our final offer now.
Go ahead.
I think you can see this meets
All of your demands and then some.
And one condition that we don't go to trial.
I think we can handle that.
There is one other thing.
They want an apology.
Excuse me?
Fine.
Mr. Harkin?
Just settle this thing, will you?
Well, Patti...
It's always a pleasure.
Until next time.
Mrs. Florrick.
Excuse me. You got a minute?
Sure.
This one looks pretty good, and if you don't like this one,
I think we need to start looking at the new crop of ivy leaguers.
Courtney, this is Alicia Florrick.
Hi.
Hi.
I didn't expect you.
Spur of the moment.
Sorry I missed your birthday.
The kids said the visit went well.
Yeah, they... They look great.
Zach's almost as tall as I am.
Three months, then suddenly, boom.
Mom tells me you're working on a hard case.
I guess you're putting in a lot of hours with Will.
A lot of time to think about things in here.
A lot of time out there, too.
He's not what he seems, alicia.
Peter, if it's one thing I'm learning...
Nobody is.
Gardner acts like he's this good guy
And he's everybody's best friend,
But I could tell you a few things about him.
What?
Can we...Can we at least acknowledge
How ironic this conversation is?
I love you.
I was thinking about our apartment on 81st street.
Remember?
No air-conditioning.
It was so hot you'd... You'd run around
In that t-shirt you got from the mexican restaurant below.
All I could think was,
God, you were the most beautiful woman in the world.
Then?
No. Then and now.
I don't want to lose you.
I don't know what happened.
I lost my way.
I... I got on a power trip.
Don't.
Don't blame it on that.
I'm sorry.
No, it's me.
I understand.
I understand.
But don't give up on me.
Come on, don't give up on me.
