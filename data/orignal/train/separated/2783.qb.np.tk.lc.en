... and his mr. winky .
and ...
... him . hi !
how did everything go ?
great !
there was a projectile ...
... throwing up incident , but he started it .
we &apos;ve gotta go .
oh , right .
i &apos;ve got some news . it &apos;s about us .
you and me ?
no . susan and me .
the other &quot; us . &quot;
we &apos;re getting married .
as in , &quot; i now pronounce you wife and wife &quot; married ?
we &apos;d like you to come . we understand if you don &apos;t want to .
why wouldn &apos;t i want to come ? i had fun at the first wedding .
i just thought that
why shouldn &apos;t i be happy for you ? what would it say about me ...
... if i couldn &apos;t revel in your joy ?
and i &apos;m reveling , baby ! believe me !
is your finger caught in that chair ?
want us to go ?
the one with the lesbian wedding
this is cool . you &apos;re actually on television .
i know . it really hit me last night .
i &apos;m on days of our lives .
then i started thinking about us , and how these are the days of our lives .
yes !
what ?
carol and susan &apos;s caterer had a bike accident ...
... and she &apos;s in a full @-@ body cast .
they asked me , which is cool since i &apos;ve never catered ...
... and i need the money . is this a problem ?
would it matter ?
you &apos;re so great !
thank you !
you &apos;re really not going ?
i &apos;m really not .
they already live together . why do they need to get married ?
they love each other .
they wanna celebrate that love with the people close to them .
if you wanna call that a reason .
who &apos;s the bitterest man in the living room ?
the bitterest man in the living room ?
hi , neighbor .
i thought you were over this .
that has nothing to do with it .
if she were marrying a guy , you wouldn &apos;t expect me to go .
if she were marrying a guy , she &apos;d be the worst lesbian ever .
did i miss it ?
no , i &apos;m on right after this guy shoots himself .
she &apos;s pretty .
and she &apos;s really nice .
she taught me about how to work with the cameras ...
... and smell @-@ the @-@ fart acting .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
excuse me ?
smell @-@ the @-@ fart acting .
you got so many lines to learn so fast that sometimes ...
... you need a minute to remember your next one .
so while you &apos;re thinking ...
... you take this big pause where you look all intense .
like this ....
here &apos;s my scene ! here &apos;s my scene !
mrs. wallace ?
dr. drake ramoray , your sister &apos;s neurosurgeon .
is she going to be all right ?
i &apos;m afraid the situation is much more dire than we &apos;d expected .
your sister &apos;s suffering from a ...
... subcranial hematoma .
perhaps we can discuss this further over coffee .
nice !
for a minute , i thought you were actually smelling something .
do it again !
all right !
that was so good !
do it again .
&quot; damn it , braverman ! it &apos;s right there on the chart ! &quot;
i gotta get to work . i got a big dinosaur bone to inspect .
no , that &apos;s me .
oh , right .
oh , thanks . couldn &apos;t ....
is everything okay ?
no .
one of my clients died on the massage table today .
oh , my god !
that &apos;s a little more relaxed than you want them to get .
she was , you know , 82 years old ...
... and her name was mrs. adelman .
oh , honey .
it &apos;s just so strange . you know ...
... she probably woke up this morning and thought ...
... i &apos;ll have some breakfast , take a walk , then have my massage .
little did she know god thought , &quot; okay , but that &apos;s it . &quot;
oh , but the weirdest things was ...
... i was cleansing her aura when it happened .
and when her spirit left her body ...
... i don &apos;t think it went very far .
what do you mean ?
i think it went into me .
this is so hard .
i can &apos;t decide between lamb or duck .
well , lambs are scarier .
or the movie would &apos;ve been called silence of the ducks .
okay , who ordered what ?
i had the half @-@ drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim .
and this with the cigarette butt in it , is that decaf ?
oh , god .
you &apos;re so uptight about your mom coming .
i know . i just don &apos;t want her to think that because ...
... i didn &apos;t marry barry my life is crap .
talk about crap , just listen to stella neidman ...
... tell her story about rod steiger for the hundredth time .
i &apos;m sorry . at least you guys don &apos;t have to hear what she says in my head .
pheebs ? how long do you think this lady will be with us ?
i don &apos;t know . she obviously has some unfinished business .
sit up !
there she is !
mom !
hey , sweetie !
marlo thomas
so this is where you work !
oh , it &apos;s wonderful !
is it a living room ? is it a restaurant ? who can tell ?
i guess that &apos;s the fun .
pretty much . here , meet my friends .
monica ! you look gorgeous !
oh , my ! the last time i saw you , it was eat or be eaten .
this is joey .
this is phoebe .
this is chandler .
you remember ross ?
oh , hello , ross .
mrs. greene .
what do you think of my daughter , in the apron ...
... with the big job !
oh , mom !
if you didn &apos;t pour the coffee , no one would have anything to drink .
believe me , sometimes that happens .
this is just so exciting ! you know , i never worked .
i went from my father &apos;s house to the sorority house ...
... to my husband &apos;s house . i am just so proud of you !
really ? -yes . let &apos;s make a day of it .
we &apos;ll have lunch , shop , get our nails done . whatever you want .
i have to work .
what , no one else can pour coffee ?
i know who you remind me of .
evelyn durmer .
that &apos;s before the lousy face @-@ lift . now she looks like soupy sales .
pheebs ? who &apos;s evelyn durmer ?
i don &apos;t know . who &apos;s soupy sales ?
oh , my god !
there &apos;s an unattractive nude man playing the cello .
just be glad he &apos;s not playing a smaller instrument .
you have some life here , sweetie !
mom , i realize you were upset when i didn &apos;t marry barry ...
... and get the house in the suburbs with all the security .
this is just so much better for me .
i know . you didn &apos;t love barry , honey .
and i &apos;ve never seen you this happy .
i look at you and i think , &quot; this is what i want . &quot;
for me .
well , not just for you .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m considering leaving your father .
all right , tell me if this is too cute .
lesbian wedding ... chicken breasts .
oh , god . i think i &apos;m gonna be sick .
what ? it &apos;s not like i &apos;m putting little nipples on them .
oh , honey , i &apos;m sorry.please don &apos;t be mad at me .
what can i do ? .
you want me to make those marshmallow treats you used to like ? .
i can call up carmela and find out how .
i don &apos;t understand.i thought you were happy .
yeah , well , so did l .
know how sometimes you &apos;re driving on the highway ...
... and you get home and you can &apos;t remember having driven there ? .
that &apos;s what my life &apos;s been like .
well , couldn &apos;t you listen to the radio more ? .
i wish it were that easy.then i see you ...
... and i think , &quot; why can &apos;t i have this ? . &quot;
i want adventures , i want to hang out , i want a chandler .
mom , believe me , chandler is no reason to leave daddy .
you think i &apos;m having fun , but it &apos;s really hard . really hard .
i &apos;ve got a lousy job , i barely make rent , and forget about buying stuff !
oh , honey , you don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;d be doing what you &apos;re doing , but with money .
it &apos;s very different .
you had no idea ?
none .
they didn &apos;t fight ?
no , they didn &apos;t even talk to each other .
how was i suppose to know they were having problems ?
you know , in my day , divorce was not an option .
hey , look who &apos;s up !
i just can &apos;t believe this is happening !
when i was little , all parents got divorced .
i figured as an adult , i wouldn &apos;t have to worry about it .
can &apos;t you look at this as flattering ?
she just wants to be like you .
well , couldn &apos;t she have just copied my haircut ?
when my parents divorced , they sent me to a shrink ...
... and she told me that kids blame themselves .
but in your case , it &apos;s actually kind of true .
oh , that &apos;s him .
damn ! my mail @-@ order grandfather hasn &apos;t come yet .
phoebe ?
hi , mr. adelman .
nice to see you .
thanks for coming .
that &apos;s okay . although you did cut into my busy day of sitting .
do you wanna sit ?
no , i spent most of my morning trying to stand up .
what can i do for you , my dear ?
okay , i don &apos;t know how to say this , but ....
i think when your wife &apos;s spirit left her body ...
... it kind of stuck around ...
... in me .
you &apos;re saying my wife is in you ?
yeah . you don &apos;t have to believe me , but ...
... can you think of any unfinished business she had ?
any reason to hang around ?
i don &apos;t know what to say .
all i can think of is that ...
... she used to say that before she died , she wanted to see everything .
everything ?
everything .
that &apos;s a lot of stuff .
oh , wait , l ....
i remember she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time .
i &apos;m sorry . there &apos;s laughing in my head .
worth a shot , huh ?
look at this !
these are all halloween , three years ago.-my little martini
i love your olive head .
oh , and look , here &apos;s barry .
he came straight from the office ?
oh , no . that was his costume .
see , he &apos;s actually an orthodontist , but he came as a regular dentist .
yeah , he thought that was really funny .
you guys ?
remember when i said that i don &apos;t need your help ?
actually , i think you said ...
... &quot; don &apos;t touch that and get out of my kitchen . &quot;
really ? weird . anyway ....
i planned really well . i planned and planned .
i just didn &apos;t plan enough time to do it .
you want some help ?
lf you want .
what a day !
i took her everywhere .
the museum of modern art , rockefeller center ...
... the statue of liberty .
she &apos;s still with you ?
yes . i guess she hasn &apos;t seen everything yet .
be right back . she has to go to the bathroom again .
such a pretty face !
oh , this is so much fun ! just the girls !
do you know what we should do ? does anybody have any marijuana ?
god !
did my mother just ask if we have pot ? .
look , no one &apos;s smoking pot around all this food .
well , that &apos;s fine .
i never did it . i just thought i might .
what &apos;s new in sex ?
what &apos;s new in sex ?
the only man i &apos;ve been with is your father .
i &apos;m dicing . i &apos;m dicing . i don &apos;t hear anything .
this is no offense to your dad , but i was thinking ...
... there might be more .
you know what ? i cannot have this conversation with you .
all right .
you come here and drop this bomb on me before you even tell daddy .
do you want my blessing ? want me to talk you out of it ?
then what do you want ?
i guess i figured you would understand .
why on earth would i understand this ?
you didn &apos;t marry your barry , honey .
but i married mine .
we &apos;re in trouble . we &apos;ve only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left .
move , move , move !
i feel like you should have german subtitles .
joey , speed it up !
i &apos;m sorry ! it &apos;s the pigs ! they &apos;re reluctant to get in the blanket !
how did this happen ? i thought you had this planned out .
do you want me to cry ?
is that what you want ?
do you wanna see me cry ?
sir , no , sir !
all right , you !
no . look , i told you , i am not a part of this thing .
look , ross . i know you have issues with carol and susan , and i feel for you .
but if you don &apos;t help , i &apos;m gonna take those hot dogs ...
... and create an appetizer called &quot; pigs in ross . &quot;
all right , ball a melon !
how come i &apos;m stuck dicing when he gets to ball a melon ?
how &apos;s it going ?
great ! right on schedule .
got my little happy helpers .
that &apos;s fine . whatever .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
okay , everything . i think we &apos;re calling off the wedding .
you &apos;re still gonna pay me , right ?
or something a little less selfish .
what &apos;s the matter ? what happened ?
my parents called to say they weren &apos;t coming .
i knew they were having trouble with this , but ...
... they &apos;re my parents . they &apos;re supposed to give me away .
susan and i fought because i said maybe we should call it off .
she said , &quot; this isn &apos;t for them . it &apos;s for us . &quot;
and if i couldn &apos;t see that , we should cancel the wedding .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna say this , but i think susan &apos;s right .
you do ?
do you love her ? and don &apos;t be too emphatic about this .
of course i do .
well then , that &apos;s it .
if george and adelaide can &apos;t accept that , then the hell with them .
if my parents didn &apos;t want me to marry you ...
... no way that would &apos;ve stopped me .
look , this is your wedding .
do it .
you &apos;re right . of course you &apos;re right .
so we &apos;re back on ?
we &apos;re back on .
you heard the woman ! peel ! chop ! devil !
can &apos;t believe i lost two minutes !
it just seems so futile .
you know ? all these women , and nothing !
i feel like superman without my powers , you know ?
i have the cape , and yet i cannot fly .
well , now you understand how i feel every single day .
the world is my lesbian wedding .
butterscotch ?
no one ?
all right , you &apos;ll be sorry later .
thank you .

i know it &apos;s kind of weird , but she was a big part of my life ....
i don &apos;t know , i feel alone .
