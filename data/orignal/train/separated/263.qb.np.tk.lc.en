max , i can &apos;t wait to go home
and illegally download that documentary about performance art .
and i can &apos;t wait to go home
and watch here comes honey boo boo .
but first , you have to see this .
her name &apos;s marina abramovic .
in the &apos; 90s , she and her boyfriend
did this piece called confrontation
where they just slapped each other &apos;s faces for days .
oh , yeah ?
my mom and her boyfriend did that too ,
but they called it , &quot; who smoked the last cigarette &quot;
no , really , it was pure art .
she &apos;s a genius .
how about you and i do a little art right now ?
what are they doing ?
i think they might be doing a scene
from fifty shades of grey .
ah , okay , stop .
okay .
that &apos;s for suggesting we make a lip @-@ synch video
to call me maybe .
what &apos;s up , my man ? you look pretty down .
my mother in korea is working
my last nerve , you know , earl ?
well , uh , i didn &apos;t expect a back and forth here .
uh , max , do you wanna move in ?
han , you can &apos;t let your mommy keep bullying you .
stand up to her . you &apos;re a 53 @-@ year @-@ old man .
max , i am 29 .
what ?
i am 29 .
what do you got , a case of the benjamin buttons ?
剧中男主人公本杰明以老人形象降生人世 之后越活越年轻
caroline , han says he &apos;s 29 .
what ?
han , are you sure ?
yes , what makes you think i &apos;m older ?
well , everything-- your hair , your clothes ,
the $ 5 check you gave me for my birthday .
hi , can i help you ?
ooh , that sounded so sincere .
well , when you &apos;re in my section , you &apos;ll meet the real me .
i have one question .
do you wanna live ?
actually , today , i could go either way .
you see this ?
go around the diner and have everyone fill it
with the contents of their purse ,
and if you do , nobody gets hurt .
okay , okay , okay ,
but , uh , i don &apos;t know how much you &apos;re gonna collect here .
i mean , most of these customers pay with coins
or fresh tomatoes from their garden .
uh , earl , listen up .
we &apos;re being robbed by that man in the suit ,
and he wants everyone to empty their stuff into this bag .
uh , max , i &apos;ve been on both sides of this situation ,
and the best thing to do is play along .
okay , caroline , i &apos;m gonna tell you something ,
and i don &apos;t want you to react .
i knew you were gonna get pregnant . damn it !
all right , fine .
we &apos;ll get through this together .
no !
look , we &apos;re being robbed ,
and that guy in the suit might have a gun .
no , no--just do what i say , and stay calm .
i need you to empty your purse into the trash bag .
i can &apos;t believe this is happening
just when i saved $ 2 .
max , i can &apos;t die ,
and i certainly can &apos;t die in this ugly uniform .
i mean , it looks good on you .
are you having a heart attack ?
i &apos;m peeing .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m really freaked out , and i &apos;m peeing .
i can &apos;t stop !
just stop , stop ! clench it .
okay .
no , can &apos;t .
step out from behind the counter .
sorry , sir , i can &apos;t .
why ?
well , um , i &apos;m peeing .
still ?
out of the way , girls . i &apos;ll take down this--
get away from him .
miss , you need to get out from behind the counter now
before i--
uh , please take her , not me .
what &apos;s happening ?
han , we &apos;re being robbed .
so sorry .
please take everything
that is in my manny @-@ pack .
would it be possible if i took my prayer beads out ?
they &apos;ve been in my family for hundreds and hundreds of--
i don &apos;t think so , homeboy .
you &apos;re in my house now , bitch .
here &apos;s what &apos;s left in the bag .
nope , sorry . i don &apos;t see your dignity .
max , don &apos;t .
isn &apos;t it enough that i &apos;m wearing dishwasher whites
that have been around since the invention of b.o. ?
oh , look at that , something ate right through the swiffer ,
and i don &apos;t think it was the bleach .
how will you ever live with the shame ?
can you believe that is the man who saved us ?
yeah , i did not see a gun coming .
i saw nunchucks , ninja smoke ,
maybe some hairpulling , but not a gun .
well , good night , ladies .
i thought we all acted very brave tonight .
well , some of us .
oh , yeah , i had a trauma , and i urinated .
ha ha ! that &apos;s hilarious .
yeah , you might need some counseling .
i could drop you off at a therapist on the way to my
&quot; i was a human shield &quot; support group .
am i ever gonna live this down ?
it happened , like , ten minutes ago .
okay , let &apos;s move on .
oh , look , someone left a coupon for free movie popcorn .
oh , i &apos;d love to escape to a movie after my--
well , i &apos;d just love to escape .
how much are movies now , like 200 bucks ?
unless you go with me , in which case , it is free .
i &apos;ll take you tomorrow .
i &apos;ve been sneaking into theaters since i was two .
i crawled into the little mermaid
with a sack full of cheerios
and a baby bottle full of diet coke .
you know , chestnut ,
the only thing that got me through that robbery was you .
i kept thinking , &quot; who will take care of you ? &quot;
because you can &apos;t count on blondie selfish @-@ pants
who used me as a human shield and then peed herself .
do not tell chestnut i peed myself .
he &apos;s the only one from my circle who still talks to me .
as i was saying , chestnut ,
i would have taken a bullet for her ,
but she put herself first ,
and that &apos;s okay . it &apos;s fine .
max , i &apos;m surprised you &apos;re even affected by this .
i mean , weren &apos;t you shot as a baby ?
i feel like you told me that .
no , i told you i drank shots as a baby .
my mother hated to drink alone .
okay , what free movie should we see ?
maybe something with a fanning in it ?
i &apos;ll see anything
unless it &apos;s in 3d .
i mean , if something &apos;s gonna be flying at my face ,
i &apos;d better get a free prime rib out of it .
so what do we do , max ? what do we do ?
hide in the back alley till the coast is clear ,
and when the door opens , make a break for it ?
no , &apos; cause it &apos;s not the 1940s .
we just go right up in the usher &apos;s face ,
make an excuse , and then boldly walk with purpose .
okay , well , just show me how .
you can direct me . i &apos;ve done a lot of plays .
i could do my &quot; eliza doolittle before she was civilized &quot; walk .
主人公是在伦敦街头卖花满口乡音的少女伊丽莎
hello , governor .
wow , that was just ugly . i wish i hadn &apos;t seen it .
all right , just watch me .
walk , walk , walk , hair flip , walk , walk .
walk , walk , walk , hair flip , walk , walk .
good , but easy on the hair flip , willow smith .
oh , hi , girls .
oh , i heard what happened .
max , you got pushed in front of a gun .
you must be very pissed .
caroline , oh , what a nice outfit .
on a scale of one to ten , you &apos;re an eight .
get it ? urinate .
how do you even know what happened ?
oh , well , oleg told me when we were upstairs
playing &quot; hide the penis , &quot;
and we laughed so hard , we almost peed ourselves ,
but we didn &apos;t because we &apos;re not you .
actually , we &apos;re going to a movie .
oh , well , that &apos;s nice .
i hope you &apos;re gonna wear your big girl pants .
max .
what ? it &apos;s silly and funny .
she &apos;s like a polish fart cushion .
look , if it makes you feel any better ,
there can &apos;t be any pee jokes left .
what are you seeing ,
something rated &quot; pee pee 13 &quot; ?
fart cushions are funny .
there &apos;s the guy . i &apos;m getting a little nervous .
i &apos;m starting to sweat like those people on locked up abroad .
在世上某些最危险的地区被逮捕 挣扎求生的故事
i don &apos;t know why . i haven &apos;t swallowed a heroin balloon .
okay , let &apos;s go .
pretend we &apos;re out of breath .
out of breath , not out of your mind .
hey , sorry .
can we just run back into the theater for a second ?
i left my iphone in there ,
and the prescription for her anti @-@ seizure medication &apos;s on it .
yeah , which theater were you in ?
theatre five . went to the 11 : 15 .
got out at 1 : 20 .
a little long . could &apos;ve cut ten from it .
wow , your walk with purpose is getting
almost as impressive as han &apos;s &quot; bang , bang ,
you &apos;re in my house now , bitch ! &quot;
i know . what about han ?
before yesterday , we thought he was 53 and unarmed .
guess we learn something new about people every day .
yeah , like having to learn that when you get nervous ,
i &apos;m disposable .
that was very uncharacteristic of me .
hi , um , hallelujah .
cool name , by the way .
how are you doing today , hallelujah ?
bitter .
they wouldn &apos;t let me put an exclamation point on my name tag .
um , is there any way you could make a fresh batch of popcorn ?
i could , but it takes ten minutes ,
and your show starts in two .
actually , it takes 3.1 / 2,
and i can miss a few trailers .
i used to work at a cineplex five .
oh , so now you just know everything about life ?
come on , the opening scene sets up
where he gets his superpowers from .
hey , hallelujah here is doing the best he can .
i mean , based on his name ,
his parents clearly had bigger dreams for him ,
and it is not his fault you guys showed up two minutes
before the show starts .
maybe next time , you &apos;ll show up ten minutes early
without the attitude and the fidgety exhaling .
you think hallelujah doesn &apos;t hear that ?
he does .
sorry to be such a problem .
we &apos;ll just take whatever you &apos;ve got ready .
no , girl . i got you .
i &apos;m gonna make you a fresh batch .
hallelujah , could i have some fresh too ?
you &apos;ll get the burnt ones and like it , nerd .
let &apos;s sit down here .
ooh , i &apos;m not sticking to the floor yet .
fancy theater .
oh , hey , guys .
hope i wasn &apos;t too hard on you out there .
nice cape .
thanks . i had it in my backpack .
i wasn &apos;t sure .
you made the right choice .
she likes my cape .
technically , she likes your sister &apos;s cape .
okay , so i don &apos;t know anything about these superhero movies .
it &apos;s a remake of a prequel to a sequel ?
i &apos;m already confused .
okay , stop .
so there &apos;s always a nerdy guy ...
and he &apos;s either been wronged or bitten
or exposed to something toxic .
it gives him superpowers .
he &apos;s in love with a pretty girl who his rival tries to kill
but then won &apos;t because they have to make another movie .
also , partial nudity ,
product placement , dope explosions ,
and a killer score by hans zimmer .
okay , your knowledge of these superhero movies
is kind of turning me on right now .
wait . are you kidding me ?
the hero has red hair as a child ?
um , weird , &apos; cause when he grows up ,
he has black hair .
was there some sort of chemical spill ,
which , by the way , wasn &apos;t in the original comic book !
what am i , dumb ?
okay .
okay , come on .
come on , let &apos;s go to another movie .
what are you talking about ?
well , you obviously hate this .
you &apos;re yelling at the screen .
yelling at the screen is the best part of going to the movies ,
and more white people should learn that .
oh , wow , look at that .
that car just exploded in front of those two girls ,
and one didn &apos;t use the other &apos;s body
to block her from the flying debris .
are you ever gonna let this go ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , it &apos;s kind of a big deal .
you put my life in danger .
well , i &apos;ve apologized about it twice .
i don &apos;t know how much more i can do .
yeah , i could have died ,
but you apologized twice , so i guess we &apos;re good .
i don &apos;t like this movie .
it &apos;s violence against women .
let &apos;s go see that katherine heigl rom @-@ com sequel .
talk about violence against women .
i am gonna go spend some time with katie heigl .
at least she won &apos;t make me feel guilty .
see ya .
enjoy three walking on sunshine montages .
i don &apos;t wanna go to a movie by myself ,
and you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
i hate the way i acted .
i &apos;m a spoiled rich girl , and i always put myself first ,
and i know that &apos;s something you would never do .
shut up .
max , i think i just saw han .
it is han . what &apos;s he doing here ?
why is he sitting all the way in the back ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe he &apos;s afraid of blocking absolutely no one &apos;s view .
and who is that guy and girl he &apos;s sitting with ?
is han in a threesome ?
does he secretly have game ?
please .
the only game han has is &quot; one , two , buckle my shoe . &quot;
wait , he &apos;s leaving ,
and so is the guy he was sitting next to .
did han just get more interesting ?
we have to follow him .
he can blast a wall apart with his thoughts ,
but he can &apos;t get out of handcuffs ?
even i could get out of handcuffs !
have fun being lied to .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re always right .
are you seeing anyone ?
that was hard to watch .
why is he going to the bathroom with that stranger ?
is han also a republican senator ?
usher .
are all men &apos;s rooms this depressing ?
we are such different people .
i was just gonna say how nice it is .
i don &apos;t hear sex sounds ,
and he &apos;s not on the changing table ,
so maybe drugs are involved .
you think han &apos;s an asian drug dealer ?
what &apos;s he selling , crystal math ?
oh , look . han &apos;s coming .
aw , gross !
no , no !
i meant he &apos;s coming this way .
hey , you &apos;re running . don &apos;t run , it &apos;s han .
for him , every step we take is like a 100 @-@ meter dash .
sorry , you &apos;re the one who doesn &apos;t want han to see us .
i just don &apos;t want that kind of relationship with him .
you mean the kind of relationship
where you see someone you know at the movie theater and say hello ?
yeah , i definitely don &apos;t want that .
ladies , may i see your tickets , please ?
tickets ? max , do you--
can i see your tickets , please ?
i saw you go into another theater .
caroline ?
hi , honey .
hello ?
honey , i forgot my ticket .
he has my ticket .
han , this nice usher man thinks i snuck into the theater ,
so just show him the tickets .
you two are together ?
yeah , why ?
oh , it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s none of my business ,
but he just seems too old for you .
he &apos;s 29 .
what ?
uh , i &apos;m gonna have to see you
and your girlfriend &apos;s ticket .
uh , i thought i put the ticket in here .
tickets . you put two tickets in there , honey .
um , okay .
i cannot find it .
damn .
sir , you know that sneaking into a theater &apos;s a felony , right ?
it is ?
han , what &apos;s that face ?
it &apos;s the same face i made when i peed--
oh , honey .
how will i live with the shame ?
well , at least your fanny pack
isn &apos;t the most embarrassing thing about you anymore .
well , well , well , look who it is .
hair flip and go .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing , but it feels weird .
now , look who &apos;s walk , walk , walking with purpose
away from me again .
what ? it wasn &apos;t a big deal .
really ? &apos; cause i went to movie jail with han .
cool .
we have a mug shot .
we &apos;re a notorious gangster couple now down at the cineplex .
that &apos;s right , han @-@ nie and clyde ,
著名雌雄大盗邦妮 · 派克和克莱德 · 巴罗的真实经历拍摄的
but you know what , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m thrilled , actually ,
because you walking away gave me one thing .
an unobstructed view of my sweet , sweet ass ?
no , the satisfaction of knowing
that you are just as selfish as me .
what a selfish thing to say .
you can walk , walk , walk away from me , max ,
but you can &apos;t walk away from knowing that you split the scene .
what ? i thought you were behind me ,
and besides , we couldn &apos;t both get caught .
who would live to tell the tale of the great caroline channing ,
the girl who couldn &apos;t walk fast enough ?
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
don &apos;t turn this around .
now , i see it , the whole &quot; max &quot; of it all .
when we got caught ,
you only thought about saving yourself ,
and you weren &apos;t defending poor hallelujah .
you just wanted fresh popcorn for yourself .
what can i say ? i guess you &apos;re on to me .
you said you &apos;d take a bullet for me .
you &apos;d never take a bullet for me .
probably not . no one ever takes a bullet .
it &apos;s just something people say that they don &apos;t mean ,
like , &quot; how was your day ? &quot;
or , &quot; we &apos;ll stop if it hurts . &quot;
wow , so this is who we are , huh ?
two selfish girls who always put ourselves
before everyone else and are willing
to do anything to survive ?
guess we are .
man , we &apos;re gonna crush the cupcake competition .
but , max , even though we &apos;re ruthless ,
every now and then , on our own behalf ,
we do put ourselves second ,
and i guess that &apos;s what makes us best friends .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever done that .
yes , you have .
you let me stay on your couch
when i had no place to stay .
i guess i did .
and i gave you--
go ahead .
well , there must be something where i didn &apos;t put myself first .
let me know when you find it .
sophie , just look at you .
you couldn &apos;t look more scrumptious .
oh , maybe i could
with a little chocolate drizzled on me .
oh , good , there you are , han .
i just have one question that i have to ask you .
what is your favorite musical ?
is it the wiz ?
whiz , max ! i found another one , right ?
how do you even know about this ?
oh , oleg told me while we were having phone sex .
and by phone sex , she means we were using the phone
in the sex .
don &apos;t worry , han .
a lot of older men can &apos;t control their bladder .
i am twenty @-@ freaking @-@ nine !
ooh , what ?
i &apos;m humiliated , max .
hey , listen to me .
you didn &apos;t sell caroline out .
a lot of people would have ,
but you just stood there like a man
and peed your pants .
that &apos;s true . i did .
by the way , han , why were you at the movies in the middle of the day ?
sometimes people bug me , and i need some time away .
you know what , han ?
you &apos;re cool .
we &apos;re gonna hang sometime .
not now , not in a week ,
but in the future .
just sayin &apos; , i got my eye on you .
