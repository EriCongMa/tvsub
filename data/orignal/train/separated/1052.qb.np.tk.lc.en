this has to be one of the greatest collections of art
that &apos;s ever been found .
her name &apos;s alexandra hunter .
deals mostly in eastern european antiquities .
only been arrested once , in france ,
but all charges were mysteriously dropped .
she &apos;s an old acquaintance of neal &apos;s .
we &apos;re already familiar with alex .
said she &apos;d send me a message if she ever needed my help .
what kind of message ?
a flower .
are you a friend of neal &apos;s ?
you can say that , yes .
how do you two know each other ?
i &apos;m an fbi agent .
you grew up in witness protection .
i was 3 when the marshals took us away .
i was born neal bennett .
but in witsec , i grew up as danny brooks .
we found a gun with your dad &apos;s prints on it .
he killed a cop .
he confessed .
did you believe him ?
ellen !
they found me .
who ?
trust sam .
i spent the last decade of my life hiding from the truth .
i &apos;m finally ready to face it ,
and i &apos;ll be damned if i &apos;m turning back now
because you think i can &apos;t help you .
no fbi ?
no fbi .
neal , what are you doing ?
freeze !
let me see your hands right now !
put your hands where we can see them !
hey , good to see you .
i somehow doubt that .
no need for the serious theatrics .
you know i &apos;m your inside man , right ?
you have the right to remain silent .
where &apos;s peter ?
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .
call agent peter burke , okay ?
look , i think there &apos;s been a misunderstanding here .
you have the right to have an attorney .
fbi ! stand down !
thank you . yeah .
myrick , he &apos;s with us .
if he was in the back of your car , he &apos;d be with you .
when did you make assistant chief ?
i got my second star last month .
that &apos;s great .
look , this is our operation .
oh , so says you .
but without your help ,
my officers nabbed four pro thieves
carting off a truckful of antiques .
three professional thieves . neal caffrey is a bureau asset .
uh , while we &apos;re correcting semantic gaffes --
antiques are what you get when you pull off the highway in michigan .
those are priceless , pre @-@ christian antiquities .
neal , not helping .
i submitted those op orders over a week ago to you .
op orders ?
my patrol borough gets enough op orders in a week
to build a new station house .
well , i don &apos;t care if you could build the kremlin ,
you still have to read them .
and you &apos;re not booking him .
come on . how &apos;s this ?
i give you the collars and the seizures ,
plus , i &apos;ll call up your bureau chief
and tell him we really like
this new guy he &apos;s got in manhattan north .
if you walk with your guy ?
yep .
all right , next time you want to operate in my p.b. ,
you get me on the horn .
yeah .
oh , here you go .
thanks a lot .
nypd does not do congeniality .
not ladder climbers like myrick .
he &apos;s more concerned with commendation than cooperation .
if you &apos;re letting him get the win ,
you got something bigger in your cross hairs , don &apos;t you ?
oh , come on . i know that tell .
tell me . i @-@ i --
what is it ?
two weeks ago , we put neal under
with three thieves set to hit the greco museum .
yeah , everything went to plan until new york &apos;s finest showed up .
i can &apos;t believe i missed that .
you really get caught by a patrol officer ?
that does not count . i thought they were my backup .
but you did cuffed .
they didn &apos;t bring him in . doesn &apos;t count .
thank you . thank you .
we always believed the job had a patron
but never got a whiff until ...
jones .
i was poring over ucr
for suspects with similar criminal backgrounds ,
and i found a surprise .
alex .
but she &apos;s in a greek prison ?
she hit about a dozen historical sites
before the hellenic police caught up with her .
busted her with a collection
that would make j. paul getty green .
they let her go two weeks ago .
in time to possibly orchestrate
a high @-@ rent antiquities theft .
any idea she was in town ?
no , i haven &apos;t seen her since she was right there ,
the night before adler died .
memorable day .
i want you and alex to play catch @-@ up ,
see if she &apos;s involved in that museum heist .
we &apos;re making a lot of assumptions here .
what if she &apos;s clean ?
if she &apos;s clean , we leave her be .
can you reach out to her ?
yeah . do we have an address ?
penthouse at the athenian hotel .
we &apos;re looking at greek antiquities theft .
she checked into the athenian . i &apos;m sure she &apos;s clean .
neal &apos;s gonna need a ride downtown . let &apos;s break .
i guess that &apos;s on me . let &apos;s go .
thanks , jones .
you owe me a t.b. shot .
i chased a garbage truck five blocks .
i managed to dig out a receipt
from the hotel you followed caffrey to .
room was paid for by samuel phelps .
i asked around quietly .
some addresses in and around d.c. ,
a meager credit history , library card .
no other photos ?
just the one you took .
is there any particular reason
why we &apos;re not pushing this through bureau channels ?
i &apos;m keeping sam &apos;s name off of anything official .
you &apos;re secretly tracking caffrey ,
but you draw the line at running indices ?
i know . i &apos;m walking a line here .
any idea who this sam phelps is ?
neal thinks he was an undercover cop
on metro p.d. &apos; s organized crime squad .
makes sense there wouldn &apos;t be any photographs ,
but he &apos;s not the company caffrey usually keeps .
it &apos;s possible sam worked with neal &apos;s father .
implying caffrey &apos;s dad was a cop ?
so much for &quot; like father , like son . &quot;
neal &apos;s dad was a crooked cop .
well , if this sam character doesn &apos;t sit right with you ,
i can assign a detail .
not yet . but stay on him .
and let &apos;s keep this under wraps .
we need to take evasive measures .
alex is gonna kill us .
okay , you need to lay off the espresso , bud .
she &apos;s been hunting for that sunken submarine since prepubescence .
we stole her birthright .
technically , you stole her birthright .
and you reaped the benefits .
your hands are not clean in this .
well , do we have any of it in town ?
not much .
some , uh , gold @-@ plated housewares , mostly .
you better not throw a dinner party .
she might be in town looking for it .
things were so much simpler when she just vanished .
now i have to hide for the remainder of my natural life .
your natural life is constituted primarily of hiding .
exactly . i don &apos;t need any supplemental hiding .
i do need a stronger drink .
i wrote to her and suggested she come back to new york .
oh , did you tell her to come back
because we stole her treasure out from under her ?
no , that would have been pretty incriminating , moz .
look , she skipped town without so much as a goodbye .
she &apos;ll understand .
well , given that you &apos;re the one who has to face her ,
i &apos;m gonna let you enjoy that fantasy .
so good luck with that . package ?
yeah , june must have brought it in .
寄信人 : 凯瑟琳 · 希尔
moz .
kathryn hill was ellen &apos;s name
before she went into witsec .
a missive from the grave ?
30 years ago , ellen asked the marshals
to give this to me if we never saw each other again .
we ended up in witsec together ,
so there was never a reason to deliver it until now .
they must have been trying to get it to me for weeks ,
but both our name changes made for a lot of red tape .
oh , red is not the tape i &apos;m interested in .
what &apos;s on that cassette ?
it doesn &apos;t really say .
but i need to find a betamax player .
fortunately for you , i have a stockpile .
i &apos;ll bring one tomorrow , and we can watch .
i &apos;m gonna watch it with sam .
you mean watch it alone with sam ?
yeah .
you don &apos;t know anything about him !
i know that , with her dying breath ,
ellen told me to trust him .
exactly -- her dying breath .
he could have been associated--
stop ,
all right ? this is my call .
alex could be here any minute , all right ?
we &apos;re supposed to be in this together .
we are , moz .
concierge dropped this off in my room .
you know , a different girl might take offense
that you marked this &quot; return to sender . &quot;
well , a different guy might take offense
that you got him arrested .
i &apos;d say we &apos;re even .
oh , please .
not even close .
last time you give me this flower ,
represent our search for the music box .
our search for the u @-@ boat treasure .
given where i found it today ,
i &apos;m not really sure what it means anymore .
i wanted to see you .
and i thought you &apos;d look cuter
scowling in the backseat of a squad car
instead of smirking on the sidelines with the fbi .
did i ?
much .
i &apos;m glad i could give you that .
did you get my letter ?
yeah . after i got out of jail .
i heard .
16 months at women &apos;s central prison in thebes .
not my most pleasant trip abroad .
so , does the fed know i &apos;m back ?
i didn &apos;t mention the flower .
okay . i know your tricks , neal .
that wasn &apos;t a denial .
are you planning another job ?
would you believe me if i said no ?
probably not .
then ... no .
all right , it &apos;s late , so i will see you later , neal .
alex , what are you doing tomorrow ?
get lunch with me .
what are you doing ?
siege warfare .
you and alex aren &apos;t playing nice ?
we &apos;re never quite sure where we stand with each other .
adds to the charm .
keeps things spicy .
and we &apos;ve got lunch today .
you &apos;re not her only date .
we followed her from her hotel .
and she met with this guy ?
yeah .
well , she might not be our mastermind after all .
this looks like an assignment .
could be .
i don &apos;t like the idea of locking aex up , peter .
i know you don &apos;t , but that &apos;s the job .
well , what if we can get the puppeteer ?
if he &apos;s pulling the strings , maybe we can work something out .
okay , after lunch today ,
i &apos;ll finagle an invite back to her place .
great .
find out what &apos;s in that envelope .
and whatever your finagling methods ,
remember , we &apos;ll be watching .
it &apos;s a very ... thoughtful gift , moz .
that particular rai stone
is among the largest of its kind .
well , don &apos;t you think the micronesian people
might want to see it in a museum ?
they &apos;re not really a museum culture .
thatched huttery has certain limitations .
hey , honey .
hi . how are you ?
what are you doing here ?
moz has a surprise .
he got us a gift from ...
the island of yap .
wonderful .
i used to be able to come home , relax ,
get something to eat .
yeah , yeah , the 21st century .
everyone &apos;s life is more complicated .
speaking of complicated ,
i &apos;m gonna go outside and figure out
what to do with this new lawn ornament .
all right , what ?
okay , neal received a 30 @-@ year @-@ old betamax from ellen
that he would rather watch with sam than with me .
and you &apos;re telling me this because you &apos;re jealous ?
no . &quot; jealous . &quot;
look , while i abhor your chosen profession ,
our unholy union maybe
the only thing keeping neal from washing up in greenpoint .
you think sam &apos;s dangerous ?
of course i do .
until i &apos;m given reason to think otherwise .
unofficially , i &apos;ve put together a file on sam .
there &apos;s not much meat there .
that file is official , not related .
i won &apos;t tell anyone .
there &apos;s nothing to tell .
oh , i understand .
honey , do you happen to know anybody with a crane ?
what the hell is that ?
it was here before i got home .
well , you are now the 1 % on the island of yap .
that &apos;s not staying here .
well , that &apos;s a problem for another day .
uh , for now , i bid you adieu .
don &apos;t bother telling me he meant well .
you know , i did see the inside of a cell in bulgaria once .
so , you &apos;ve experienced the unpleasantness
of a balkan prison firsthand .
well , actually , i was breaking someone out ,
but i can extrapolate from that .
it was a time of political unrest .
the monarchy had fallen . the czar was deposed .
you were rescuing a deposed czar ?
actually , a czar &apos;s wife .
a deposed czarina ?
a deposed czarina &apos;s handmaid .
what ?
she had a lead on the dabene treasure in the karlovo valley .
you &apos;d do the same thing .
all right , neal &apos;s anklet shows him heading our way .
we online ?
just about .
the hotel pegged our system
to the lobby and hallway circuits .
but once he &apos;s behind the door , he &apos;s on his own .
yeah , i don &apos;t like it .
i get the impression
neal and alex are still on unsettled terms .
&quot; unsettled &quot; meaning what ?
she wants to bed him or kill him ?
fine line .
our job is to stay watchful
and try to minimize surprises .
yeah , i &apos;m not sure we &apos;re gonna have a lot to say in that matter .
what the hell is he doing there ?
damn it , he &apos;s gonna blow this .
if neal and alex get close , call my cell .
i &apos;m gonna pull him out .
hello ? housekeeping .
i &apos;ve come to refresh your pillow mint .
oh , it &apos;s been a long time since we &apos;ve had a real ,
honest @-@ to @-@ god conversation -- without ulterior motives .
well , other than the fact
that you &apos;re in town to rob a museum
and i &apos;m supposed to keep an eye on you ?
other than that .
you know , neal and alex just talking --
it &apos;s a distant memory .
maybe we continue this honest @-@ to @-@ god conversation
upstairs over a glass of wine ?
yeah , uh , it &apos;s not a good time , neal .
oh , other plans ?
none of my plans included you .
plans have a way of going awry .
mozzie !
suit ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
if you &apos;ve come to help me scout , you &apos;re too late .
i made a breakthrough .
you need to get out of here now .
sam is samantha . he is a she .
he is definitely not a she .
well , he &apos;s curious .
this is not sam &apos;s suite .
that file listed this as his address .
the file i explicitly told you wasn &apos;t sam &apos;s file ?
so i &apos;ve made a tremendous mistake .
that was alex hunter &apos;s file .
oh ! that explains the brassiere .
it &apos;s a shame you have to arrest her ,
but it does help me avoid an uncomfortable conversation .
you owe me one .
why the hell were you digging into my files ?
i brought you a rai stone .
right . i forgot .
you owe me two uncomfortable conversations .
how close are they ?
they &apos;re here , but i &apos;m not sure neal &apos;s making it upstairs .
they &apos;re stalled out front .
of course , if anybody can do it ...
we &apos;re not gonna get eyes on her assignment .
all right , we &apos;ll head out the back way .
come on , this operation &apos;s a bust .
well , her assignment ?
what are we looking for ?
we &apos;re not looking for anything .
i don &apos;t have a warrant .
i &apos;m trespassing . exigent circumstances .
i love how you two think
that law was designed as a loophole .
besides , i can only log what &apos;s in plain view .
okay .
stop .
what are you doing ?
oh ! plain view .
stop .
plain view .
stop it !
did you see a manila envelope ?
ah , come on .
yes .
i got it .
fantastic .
thank you .
the hell ?
where &apos;d you go ?
where did you g ...
that &apos;s not good .
you do know how invaluable i am to you , right ?
jones .
peter , it &apos;s not good . they &apos;re right outside the door .
i know a good wine @-@ delivery service .
you &apos;re right . that &apos;s not good .
hey ! come up here .
... have a few very good bottles .
shh ! quiet !
oh , some things never change .
any preference ?
we need to get out of here .
there .
surprise me .
so , what &apos;s your issue with the rai stone ?
someday , i &apos;m gonna strangle you .
you go to greece
and proceed to steal the historical relics
until you &apos;re caught , right ?
right .
why ?
well , i bought a medieval villa in sardinia ...
... before we found the sub .
congratulations . but i don &apos;t get the connection .
i was suffering the absurd illusion that
i &apos;d be moving in with the most incredible art in the world .
and without the sub , i couldn &apos;t decorate .
i got you .
and why go to pottery barn
when you can accent with 6,000 @-@ year @-@ old stolen amphora ?
exactly .
to a long overdue reunion .
so , that night , i set up at the weigh station near the docks .
i figured i could drop onto adler &apos;s truck as it passed .
and ride until they stopped , then commandeer the vehicle .
instead , you watched the warehouse explode .
i assumed , if you meant to steal it , you &apos;d let me know .
well , in all fairness , you did just say
that you planned to steal it without us , right ?
right . but i wouldn &apos;t have cut you out .
really ? equal thirds ?
well , maybe not equal .
i have missed you , neal .
me , too .
and in all honesty , that treasure you wanted so badly
has been a lot more trouble than it &apos;s worth .
oh , you and king midas -- whiners .
and i need more wine , please , if you can .
thanks .
彼得 · 博尔克
you know , i could take that trouble off your hands if you &apos;d like .
oh ! that &apos;s gonna stain .
can i just run to your bathroom really quick ?
go ahead . it &apos;s upstairs .
all right . i &apos;ll be right back .
please tell me there is a good reason
the two of you are trapped in alex &apos;s bathroom .
we &apos;re not trapped . we &apos;re , uh , biding our time .
it &apos;s a long story , but we got alex &apos;s envelope .
is it an assignment ?
oh , those are from the greek exhibit at the hellerman .
yeah , it &apos;s the amorgos expedition .
this could be quite the haul .
well , we still don &apos;t know who alex is working for .
nice .
not yet .
are you gonna run his dna ?
yeah .
remind me never to lick anything ever again .
wherever you found this , you put it back .
all right , when i give you the opportunity , go .
i mean , how -- you know what ?
you remember the view
from the table mountain lodge in cape town ?
yeah . we were running a two @-@ handed con
on a south african jeweler .
hmm , yeah .
back then , we could just be ourselves
and not have to shake on it .
who &apos;s to say we can &apos;t be right now ?
well , wait , you didn &apos;t -- you didn &apos;t clean your sleeve .
you were searching my bedroom .
would it help if i told you i didn &apos;t have a choice ?
uh , you know what ?
for a man who &apos;s capable of so many surprises ,
you &apos;re becoming painfully predictable .
alex , when we first came up here , i --
you know what ? just go .
all right .
well , you successfully blew my cover .
you care to explain ?
mozzie showed up . i followed him .
i was looking for sam .
why are you both together looking for sam ?
it was a big misunderstanding .
listen , i appreciate your concern , okay ?
but just stay out of it .
look , the bottom line is we both don &apos;t understand
why you would choose sam instead of me .
that &apos;s not the bottom line .
but it still seems like a risk
to show him the betamax before we &apos;ve seen it .
you went behind my back to the feds ?
i know . desperate times , neal .
what do you know about sam ?
i know he &apos;s the only one with answers .
he says he has the answers , but -- - peter , who killed ellen ?
was my father corrupt , or was he set up ?
no ? nothing . how about you ?
i &apos;ll see you guys later .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s happy with us .
we got a hit from interpol on hunter &apos;s employer .
this is rasmus spiteri ,
greece &apos;s new general secretary for culture and tourism .
according to states , spiteri &apos;s been petitioning
for the legal return of plundered antiquities for months .
he hasn &apos;t gotten any traction .
this is not a theft for profit .
no , i think it &apos;s a cultural reclamation project .
he &apos;s commissioning these jobs in
the name of national heritage .
if hunter made caffrey ,
i can &apos;t imagine she &apos;ll still hit the hellerman .
we &apos;ve got a team on her .
if she makes a move , she &apos;s ours .
what do you think , neal ?
think she &apos;ll still go for it ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
i mean , you seem to be the expert at investigating your friends .
what do you think ?
uh , whether she goes for it or not , it doesn &apos;t give us spiteri .
unless neal convinces alex to roll on him .
i told her i wasn &apos;t looking into her ,
and then she caught me red @-@ handed .
that kind of disloyalty stings
for more than just a couple hours .
guys , you want us to clear out ?
we &apos;re fine . right , neal ?
yeah . i &apos;ll talk to her .
there &apos;s still a card i haven &apos;t played .
no need for pleasantries . i &apos;m just here for one reason .
is this it ?
it &apos;s all i could come up with on short notice .
well , as peace offerings go , you know ,
this is -- this is pretty meager .
unless you want to go back to prison , let me help you .
please .
the only reason that i was in prison is because of you .
i didn &apos;t tell you to knock over the acropolis .
no . no , no , no . you didn &apos;t tell me anything .
eight years we scoured the globe together .
and -- and you send me one lousy letter .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
what was i supposed to do ? come find you ?
how could you ? you were too busy buying an island .
yeah , i heard .
none of this was planned .
well , you know , like you said ,
plans have a way of going awry .
how much does burke know ?
enough to put you away .
he knows spiteri hired you to hit the hellerman gallery .
look , one day spiteri walks into my cell with an offer --
pull a heist or stay locked up indefinitely .
he strong @-@ armed you ?
the least bad choice is the best .
well , listen , you have another choice now .
i hate to say it , but it &apos;s the fbi .
they only care about the big fish .
you help them get spiteri , and you walk .
they have nothing to get him on
but passing me photographs .
yeah , exactly .
that &apos;s why we
are gonna go through with your job at the hellerman .
what do you mean by &quot; we &quot; ?
well , i think i know what it &apos;s like to be beholden to a master .
let &apos;s get you out of this .
help me get comfortable with this .
the only way to get spiteri
is to put stolen property in his hands .
right now we &apos;ve got no charges .
makes sense .
i should have told you i was looking into sam .
yeah . you should have .
it never gets any easier .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
good .
all right .
all right .
hellerman &apos;s this way .
yeah , i &apos;m just gonna make a quick stop .
for what ?
spray paint .
isn &apos;t there a 60 @-@ year old retired cop
you &apos;d prefer to do this with ?
i wanted you here , didn &apos;t i ?
a minor conciliation .
i would rather be watching the betamax .
also , i do not like this plan .
look , it &apos;s simple .
the hellerman gallery &apos;s hosting a new exhibit
on modern greek identity .
to which you , as a prominent contemporary artist ,
will add ... ostensibly .
so , what don &apos;t you like about the plan ?
alex . is she or is she not going to kill me ?
alex parked the box truck out back .
after they load it up , we follow it to the meet with spiteri .
hey , do you really feel good
about caffrey going through with this thing ?
last night in the conference room seemed pretty shaky .
we &apos;re back on the same page .
does caffrey know ?
here we go .
my assistant has arrived .
alex .
you &apos;re dead to me .
i still don &apos;t see why i can &apos;t be the artist .
remember that memling i forged ?
we &apos;re not doing a flemish landscape .
oh , no . we &apos;re doing a paint @-@ by @-@ numbers .
i had no express interest to cut you out .
if you set genghis khan in front of
a manchurian rebel camp ,
he &apos;s gonna do his thing .
moz .
it &apos;s the same way with me and treasure troves .
i was just kidding , moz .
here .
this is their real contact information for the stein agency ?
well , any curator worth her salt
would recognize a fake number .
then they &apos;d better be expecting a phone call .
oh , they are .
great .
then let &apos;s go rob a museum .
hi . um , i &apos;m looking for the curator , miss graham ?
she &apos;s right over here .
uh , i &apos;m parker graham . how can i help you ?
yeah , we &apos;re here for gallery 2b .
yes , of course . it &apos;s down the hall , second floor .
is it prepared ?
prepared for what ?
oh , god . what an idiot .
excuse me ?
no , not you . sorry .
you should have switched agents a long time ago .
my agent didn &apos;t call you ?
no . i &apos;m sorry . who are you ?
i can &apos;t really say .
but my assistant and i were supposed to have full access
to gallery 2b today .
well , i &apos;m sorry to disappoint you , whoever you are ,
but no arrangements have been made .
we can come back tomorrow .
what do you mean , tomorrow ?
we have berkshire tomorrow .
they gave us a wall at windsor castle .
what does that mean , a wall at windsor ?
that &apos;s the royal residence .
don &apos;t stroke his ego .
who are you ?
will you please ?
okay .
you can expect him to
&quot; exit through the gift shop . &quot;
does that mean that you &apos;re --
and what do you want with gallery 2b ?
yeah ?
is this mr. sanderson of the stein agency ?
yeah .
i &apos;m calling from the hellerman gallery --
oh , is he there already ?
i &apos;m afraid he is ... with a peculiar request .
shoot . that &apos;s my fault .
i @-@ is there any way he can
have the run of the place tomorrow ?
tomorrow he &apos;s going to windsor castle .
oh , that &apos;s right .
if your client wants to do an installation here at our gallery ...
he does .
... then i &apos;m sure we can accommodate him .
ladies and gentlemen , this gallery is now closed .
and the cameras ?
sherman , switch off the cameras in 2b .
how much time do i have ?
not long -- a couple minutes .
oh , aphrodite &apos;s a thief now ?
well , she wasn &apos;t the sole inspiration .
you know , this plan would have worked
even if you hadn &apos;t painted anything .
it &apos;s only fair . we &apos;re cleaning them out .
couldn &apos;t resist , huh ?
how often do you have the opportunity to add a piece
to the hellerman &apos;s permanent collection ?
there goes the little guy .
switch to two .
boss , we have a problem .
not again .
that idiot .
alex ?
freeze . put your hands over your head .
this is the second time you crashed my undercover , myrick .
and this time , it &apos;s too big for you to screw it up .
screw it up ? silent alarm sounded .
we got here in time to make our arrest .
that &apos;s called good police work .
that &apos;s called bull . get my guy out of your car .
no . i don &apos;t think i will .
i asked one thing .
i asked you to call me personally
if you have an action in my district .
i didn &apos;t have time , and , to be blunt --
i don &apos;t owe you that call .
maybe not , but now you owe new york county 10 grand .
damn .
jones , diana , find alex .
i got to bail neal out of jail .
thank you .
i don &apos;t know what her move is ,
but alex put this in motion .
i watched her disable the silent alarm .
and the minute the pd showed up , she was gone .
what ?
no , it just used to mean something
to say that you caught neal caffrey .
but now that the police are doing it all the time --
oh , once again , this does not count .
says the man who spent four hours in a cell
with two drunk @-@ and @-@ disorderlies and a shopping @-@ cart thief .
she planned this .
i know . the question is , why ?
we &apos;re looking at two heists ,
both of which were botched in impressive fashion .
first , a patrol car is parked across the street
during the greco job .
nypd dispatch sent that car in response to
a &quot; suspicious character &quot; who never existed .
and second , i don &apos;t believe
alex failed to deactivate the alarm at the hellerman .
these jobs were built to fall short .
but why put crews together
if you don &apos;t want them to get away with it ?
no sign of hunter , but we got a hit on spiteri .
he rented a transatlantic freighter set for thessaloniki .
a freighter ? he &apos;s got nothing to ship .
i guess no one told him .
or he still thinks he &apos;s gonna get his score .
berrigan .
but the entire cash is in the --
nypd evidence warehouse .
jones , get units over to manhattan north
and to the docks at red hook .
okay . boss , we &apos;re too late . pd just sent this .
they got alex on tape
busting out of the nypd warehouse .
alex knew successfully pulling off
two heists was a long shot .
and she made sure nypd
put all the antiquities in one place .
add a bit of cat burglary --
a little auto theft --
and she makes off with both hauls simultaneously .
let &apos;s cut her off .
jones , talk to me .
dug into the video nypd sent over .
i &apos;m tracking a box truck , plate number ida @-@ union @-@ 2 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 6 .
traffic cams have it southbound on 2nd .
she won &apos;t stay on a street with heavy traffic .
jones , call the 17th .
get them to scramble cars through truck routes and industrial thoroughfares .
i &apos;m on it .
how did i not see this coming ?
you &apos;re an aries , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah , march 21st . why ?
please say a command .
horoscope . aries .
hello , aries . it &apos;s a 3 @-@ out @-@ of @-@ 10 day .
the moon @-@ uranus conjunction in a sign of aries
will allow you to see an old acquaintance in a new light .
but don &apos;t be fooled .
you will soon revert to old roles .
you checked my horoscope ?
i had some time to kill while you were in lockup .
and , i repeat , you checked my horoscope ?
you have to admit , it &apos;s dead @-@ on .
horoscopes always seem relevant . that &apos;s the con .
but if you &apos;re gonna start taking life advice from a car --
you &apos;re no fun .
well , i &apos;m having a 3 @-@ out @-@ of @-@ 10 day .
burke , we pulled her over .
we &apos;re pulling her out .
i &apos;m done with you .
i hope you didn &apos;t get too attached to that second star .
she won &apos;t be armed , peter .
stand back .
spiteri , get the hell out of the van .
put your hands up where i can see them .
come on .
where &apos;s hunter ?
she &apos;s gone . there was another car .
what other car ?
i don &apos;t know . a black car .
what the hell were you thinking ?
that i would take back what was taken from my country .
peter , you should get back here .
cuff him .
that &apos;s definitely not greek .
no , i &apos;d say late 19th @-@ century russian .
this was her angle from day one .
and she &apos;s been one step ahead of us the whole time .
she &apos;s gone , peter . she &apos;s gone .
you left the candelabra .
i don &apos;t know why ,
but i thought you &apos;d be more sentimental .
well , if i can &apos;t have the treasure ,
i &apos;ll take a treasure .
you used spiteri .
he was using me to the same end .
and you played me .
was any of it real ?
yeah , well , there &apos;s really a villa in sardinia
that needs decorating .
but we were never just neal and alex .
this is neal and alex .
i could call peter right now .
oh , but you wouldn &apos;t .
because you owed me a treasure .
now ... we &apos;re even .
i don &apos;t trust you touching my wires .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t either .
if i find out you &apos;ve bugged my house --
well , that would be easy .
i &apos;m just saying , you &apos;ve got a mess back there .
hey , neal .
hey , peter .
come on in .
thanks .
moz .
uh , can i get you anything ?
no , i &apos;m good . thanks .
glad you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m happy you decided to watch that with us .
you got to pick who you can trust , right ?
well , whatever it is ,
if ellen had wanted the whole world to see it ,
she would have given it to channel five news .
instead , she gave it to me .
and , maybe if she was still alive ,
she would have wanted you to see it .
i don &apos;t know .
but you don &apos;t want to make that decision for her .
no . i want to make it for me .
whatever &apos;s on here ...
i know .
you ready to see what ellen wanted to show you
when you were three years old .
i am .
