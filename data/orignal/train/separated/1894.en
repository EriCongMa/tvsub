"Hard Bargain"
I am telling you, once we got these doctors talking,
it was a horror show.
Shh. I just got Sofia back down.
Oh, and, uh, Portland Gen has quotas now.
Yeah. It's unspoken, but it's understood
that you have to churn out a certain number of procedures.
And no research?
Nope. Pegasus is only interested
in high-volume, high-price-tag procedures.
Barely any patient interaction.
So no research, no innovation,
no opportunity to do what it is we got into medicine to do.
Well, we won't let that happen to us here.
Oh, yeah? That's what they said at first.
And then the people that fought management got fired,
and the rest wore down or they left.
They say there's one sure sign
of a successful negotiation.
Now I don't want to leave. None of us do.
You guys, come on. We have to do this.
We have to buy the hospital.
Whoa. Hold on.
Maybe she's right.
Just wait.
It's that when the parties leave the table...
What if we don't want to?
they both feel like they've been screwed.
Yes. Ah, yes.
Is it--is it this?
Or... or that?
Oh, that. Oh, exactly that.
The goal is a compromise...
Okay.
Your turn.
a situation where everybody wins.
I'm sorry. It's never been my dream to run a hospital.
Okay, well, you might not have to run it.
Cristina should be here.
I have been texting her.
I just got back to work.
And, Derek, you just got your hand back.
Don't you want to just work?
Work where?
I don't want somebody telling me
which patients I can and can't treat.
Or putting a stopwatch
on how much time you can spend with them.
Yeah, if we ran the place,
we could make policy decisions based on experience. Do y--
Uh, no offense, but that is a naive way of putting it.
The job is much harder than you think.
I wanted it once, and I hated it.
We should stay the course.
I made a deal with Pegasus
that apparently will help the sale.
What... deal?
Nothing, it's stupid.
But maybe that's how we make it work,
from the inside.
What about Hunt?
I mean, he's pushing for the Pegasus sale.
He thinks it's a good deal.
So what's he gonna say?
Oh, it's Cahill.
You know, she just wants to strategize.
At 3 A.M.?
I bet she does.
You know the nurses are threatening a walkout,
and I have to talk them down?
You know what? No.
Let's just not talk about this.
I just want to be here for a few hours with you
where there are no problems.
You know, the sale to Pegasus closes in three days.
And Cahill says the buyers are getting twitchy,
and if there is a mass exodus of the staff--
even if there's a tiny exodus--
I mean, basically if anybody leaves,
then the buyers are gonna back out,
and we lose the sale, and...
the hospital closes.
That's not gonna happen.
You sure?
Maybe?
You can be a little more convincing.
Okay. That's not going to happen.
What are we talking about, like $100 million, $200 million?
You know what we're talking about.
We have more than we're ever gonna be able to spend anyway.
We have more than we'll ever be--
No, that's not true.
But I don't know.
This is a massive undertaking.
Nobody knows what it's gonna cost.
So what are you saying?
Are you saying that they take everything?
I mean, everything from the lawsuit, from all of us?
I have no idea what it's gonna cost to buy Seattle Grace,
but I can guarantee you
it's more than the four of us have combined. I--
That's only $60 million.
I had some money before all this.
I've got about...
700 grand I can get to right away.
It's true. We have money in the I.R.A. And we have about--
No, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Well, just the lawsuit damages then.
And, uh, we've got Mark's share, too.
Mark's share?
Yeah, and Lexie's maybe? Is that rude of me--
I mean, I would have to ask her f--our--our father--
Don't worry. Excuse me. Yes, this is rude of you.
Okay, I'm sorry, but we can't waste time on politeness here.
And Mark's share is not our money. It's Sofia's.
You should've talked about this with me-- um,
that's what we're doing.
I mean privately with your wife.
Where is Cristina?
I don't know. I keep texting her.
She would say yes to this.
How do you know that?
She knows.
Leave us alone.
Oh, get some sleep.
This isn't all on your shoulders.
It shouldn't be.
It is right now.
If I can't, you know, if I can't talk the nurses
into staying--
You will.
I just don't know what's gonna happen,
with or without Pegasus.
I keep running through the worst-case scenarios and...
All I know is...
that I'm happy here with you.
Whatever's falling apart, I just...
You and I, we're...
We're safe.
Right. Right?
Exactly right.
I don't think that it's right to spend all of our money.
It is an investment.
Of all of our money, Callie.
If your parents had ever made you have a summer job...
you might understand.
Oh, come on. That is so unfair.
No, you are ready to bankrupt us.
You're ready to let Pegasus Horizons turn us into a bunch of robots.
You are ready to sink $50 million
into maintaining a good vibe.
So what's the alternative, we leave?
No, I don't want to leave.
This hospital is not something that we lucked into.
This is something that we made.
And Webber hired us, and he set a tone.
Hunt sets a tone,
and it's something I am proud to be a part of,
and it's worth fighting for.
Shoot. Sorry. Is that mine or yours?
It's mine, but she's gonna wake yours.
I think Callie's right.
This isn't about a financial investment.
It's a much bigger opportunity...
Right.
to stay and make the place we dreamed of work again.
Yes.
Oh, god. Will you two stop it?
We are not spending this money.
If I have learned anything in the past year,
It's that we don't get to know what's coming around the corner.
Anything can happen, to you, to me. Anything.
And our daughter deserves
as much protection as we can give her.
And we have the chance to not have to worry
no matter what happens,
a chance to be prepared should the worst happen--
I don't want to live like that...
Getting ready for disasters that may never happen.
Well, we have an opportunity right now
to do something about it.
And maybe we have a responsibility to do that--
Oh, don't try and make me feel selfish.
Don't try and make me feel guilty
just because you do.
Who said I felt guilty?
I think--I think you felt guilty,
but that's not--it's not--.
No, no, no, no, no. Let's--go ahead.
Tell me.
Some of us died.
And some of us are gonna live with challenges
for the rest of their life.
And you-- you got the money.
And then you got your hand back
and you got your career back,
And I think that you feel guilty.
I think you feel guilty about your decision to sue
and I-I think that you feel guilty
about having all this money.
And now I think that you want to be the one
that comes in and saves everyone,
and you have to be the hero.
And it's selfish and it's egomaniacal,
and now it's affecting my family.
So just stop. Okay?
Everything that you've done to make it better
has actually made it worse.
So please stop.
I think we should go.
You should.
艰苦的谈判
Hey, Derek. I owe you an apology.
Oh, no. There's no need.
No, no, I do.
It was late, and I was tired and stressed out.
Well, we were all stressed out.
We're just trying to do our best.
No, I know, but I had no right to call you egotistical.
It was "Egomaniacal," I think.
Yeah. I was out of line.
On the other hand...
You're Pegasus' "Face of the hospital"?
Cahill said it would be some brochures,
some schmoozing, not...
all of this.
Not a whole lot of practicing medicine either.
I hope you know what you're in for.
No offense, Derek.
I mean, it's a great face, but...
This is a lot of it.
I mean, this is kind of gross.
This is unacceptable.
Dr. Shepherd, hold up!
Yeah?
Love the picture.
Love it. Your head is gigantic.
I'm prepping for our A.V.M.
Do you prefer O.R. two or four?
He's doing an A.V.M. Under hypothermic arrest
where he drops the brain's temperature
to avoid stroke risk.
I know what it is.
He's the only one in the region who does it.
I know.
I've always wanted to see it up close.
Can we go now?
I'm not doing it. Cahill wants me to meet the buyers.
He's the new face of the hospital now.
And the hair. Lucky us.
Great. Just make it go away.
Oh, my god.
Can we talk about the giant pictures of myself?
Do you love them?
I want 'em down, all of them.
I agreed to a brochure.
"And other marketing materials and collateral."
This is that.
What are you ashamed of,
telling people that your hospital
is more than just a set of
clinically sterilized walls and equipment,
that it is full of people who are intelligent
and passionate about caring for them?
'cause that is what your face tells people.
Says who?
Well, three focus groups can't be wrong.
So just give it a few days.
You'll get used to you.
You ready for the nurses?
Marcia Lowe to C.T.U...
It means a lot to me, Derek.
I know this is not you.
I know this is a sacrifice,
but this sale is our last shot,
and I feel like I've been fighting this battle alone.
And to have you in the fight with me...
That means a lot.
I don't, uh...
I don't want to do this anymore.
Oh. Oh, I, um--
No, no, no, no. No, no, not--not this.
I want to do this.
Lots of this.
I just don't want to do it... here.
I want to take you out on a date.
Someplace that doesn't have...
Wheels...
Yes, okay. That would-- that would be nice.
And where fewer people have bled to death.
Oh, well, now I'm totally sold.
Tonight?
Tonight?
Okay.
Great.
I can't wait to see you out of those clothes.
I meant... scrubs.
Uh, in regular... clothes.
Not that you don't look great in scrubs,
'cause you would look great in anything...
Like, uh, coveralls or--
or parka.
7:30?
7:30.
Oh, and if I'm late,
it's because I'm still banging my head into a wall
over how this just went.
It went great.
Could be a volvulus.
Let's intubate and put in an N.G. tube.
Draw 0.8 of Etomidate.
When was the baby delivered?
25 minutes ago. Vomiting, distended abdomen.
I need those films back, stat.
Give me the Etomidate.
Sedatives in a newborn need a light touch,
so I like to do it myself.
It's okay, buddy. You go to sleep.
I promise you won't remember any of this crap.
What are you smiling about?
Nothing.
Cut it out.
We need to tell his parents
their brand-new baby needs surgery.
His bowels have twisted around the blood supply,
causing an obstruction.
So...
We need to do
an emergency surgery to correct that immediately.
So... we are going to...
Do that.
Mr. Finch, uh, can I, uh,
speak with you outside for a sec?
I know this is a lot to take.
Um, are you and your wife okay?
Who, Langer?
I don't know. I don't know her that well.
That's my kid, but she-- but she's not my wife.
We work together.
We hooked up one time.
We tore one off at an office party...
And his condom breaks
because he's too cheap and stupid
to buy decent ones.
I'm almost 40, I want a baby, so I told him,
"You're off the hook, but I'm keeping it."
And he says that he wants to do the right thing.
I'm gonna raise that baby.
I mean, financially, yeah, but I'm gonna be there.
I want to, you know... be a father to that kid.
He's a complete asshat, but he makes a good living.
She's a bitch on wheels,
but she's smart and she's tough.
A kid could do worse.
And right now all I care about is my baby.
Is my baby gonna be okay?
Tell me my kid's gonna be okay.
Can you do that?
So the chemo didn't work?
Just like the radiation.
A.J.'s cancer has continued to spread.
So what, surgery now?
I mean, you said that surgery could kill him.
You said he was too weak.
Well, Dr. Bailey here is suggesting another approach.
Yeah, it's called Genome Mapping.
If we can identify the specific D.N.A. Sequence
of A.J.'s tumor,
It could open up a variety of treatment options
and targeted drug therapies.
A-and no surgery?
You can do that here?
Uh, no, not--not yet.
We would have to contract out to another facility.
I'm just waiting for approval
from the hospital advisory board,
and I think we'll have that today.
We would just need to have your consent
to try--
We will take this as a "Yes."
Okay.
Okay, I have salary and bonus breakdowns,
benefits packages, pension stuff--
Don't be nervous.
I'm not. I can talk to my people.
Well, I hope so,
'cause if not, we're in trouble.
You trying to make me nervous?
Hey, uh, Dr. Hunt?
Uh, Bailey, I have to--
No, I-I just wondered
what you heard back from the advisory board.
Uh, about?
About m-my genome mapping.
The request I submitted to sequence--
Right, right. Sorry. Um, they turned it down.
Well, no, no, no. It's-- it's just one sequence...
It's a "No."
For...
Sorry.
Okay, so what is the big secret plan?
We want to pool our winnings from the lawsuit
and buy the hospital.
I was hoping you'd be on board.
Maybe I misspoke.
So that is the plan?
Yes.
That is so stupid!
You don't know the first thing about owning a hospital
or running one, and neither do I.
Well, Pegasus Horizons knows how not to run a hospital.
I mean, you should hear Callie's stories.
It's this or go somewhere else.
No. N-no one leaves.
Owen says if people start leaving,
the sale won't go through, and we're screwed.
That's why we want to buy it,
because we're doctors, and we know how it runs.
Did you know you'll have to file a declaration
for land use for approval by the state attorney general?
Will we?
I don't know. I just made that up.
But see? We don't know anything about this.
I'm surprised. I thought you'd be on board.
Or you'd leave again.
Hey, no one leaves.
Owen is killing himself trying to keep the hospital open.
Can we please stop talking nonsense
and have his back?
Hey. Our, uh, panniculectomy was discharged.
Said to say thanks.
Liposuction day?
High-volume, high-price-tag,
'cause when Pegasus trims the fat, so do I.
What's the matter?
Nope. Can't talk about it.
Why, 'cause of her?
Mrs. Berkus.
Mrs. Berkus.
Mrs. Berkus!
She's blotto. What's up?
No, I can't talk about it to you.
I could when we were friends, but now...
Oh, we seriously can't be friends now?
Yes, we can.
Just...
This is too much.
How about this?
I will tell you a thing
I would tell you when we were friends.
My mom...she is driving me nuts
about taking a bigger role in the Harper Avery foundation.
"Grow up, child. Get your legacy on."
It's not bad advice.
I know that, but I'm working my ass off here,
and I'm not even an attending yet.
You know what? You're a crappy friend.
You're supposed to side with me.
I d...
See? Now you go.
So I've been seeing this paramedic.
I'm aware.
Too much?
No. I told you
I was seeing Stephanie the intern.
Was that too much?
No. I mean, it's not a thing.
It's just, you know, fun and...
We're not serious.
We both know how that can turn out.
That is true.
Okay, your turn.
Uh, okay.
So...
He asked me out... on a date,
Like our first real date.
And it's really, like, our fifth date.
And...and this real date
is probably gonna wind up at someone's apartment.
And it's...going in a direction, you know?
And it's one thing to tell a guy
that you're a virgin and hope he understands,
but to tell him that I was a virgin and then wasn't
and now am again...
I just feel like there's no way he's gonna understand that.
I mean, who understands that?
But I really like him and I just...
It's all gonna end tonight.
Oh, god. Too much.
Nope.
Oh, way too much, April.
Look, tell him exactly what you told me,
and he won't care whether you're a virgin or not.
He won't?
He'll be worried you're mentally ill,
because you sound like a nut job.
Good to have you back, pal.
Hey, I'm kidding.
No, I know. See ya.
Come on, April.
I guide the parachute into the heart,
open it...
So it will block off the damage caused by his heart attack.
It should keep the rest of his heart
from working so hard while it heals.
That is crazy balls.
I'm in position now.
What did your friend at U.C. Davis say?
Are the other interns still dropping like flies?
Yeah.
There's at least four openings.
What are you talking about?
Mousy, speak.
Some of us are talking about...
Looking elsewhere.
Why?
Last year, Seattle Grace
was the residency match you dreamed of getting.
The last few weeks,
it feels like automotive trade school.
God.
Where is your sense of loyalty?
There are people here
fighting to make sure this hospital stays open at all.
And at the first sign of trouble,
you show them your ass?
No. No, it's just that...
I'm sorry.
I only have five years
to get as good at this as I possibly can.
And I want to be excellent.
I want to be the best,
so I can't waste another minute.
I mean, would you have when you were an intern?
Honestly?
There's the volvulus.
All right. Retract there.
I'll dissect.
Do you think they can work,
workplace relationships?
What? What do you mean?
Look at these two...
Coworkers who wanted a quickie
and got a baby.
Well, they both seem to want the baby.
Yeah, but they don't want each other.
And now they're stuck seeing each other
at the kid's recitals and at staff meetings?
It's a disaster, right?
Ah, I don't know. Everybody's different.
True.
You've had relationships with coworkers.
Yeah.
And look how those played out.
You're single and alone.
When I met you, you had a mattress and one bowl.
Come on. That's...
Yeah, well...
It's just... more trouble than it's worth, right?
What happened?
Hematoma on the liver. It burst.
2-0 chromic.
Crap. It's tearing.
Pack him. Pack him gently.
I need, uh, thrombin and fibrin glue.
Get some factor vii in here now.
Right away, doctor.
I got your page.
I thought you weren't doing the A.V.M..
Oh, we're not.
Pegasus wants to do some photos of me in surgery.
It's not real. You know, it's just pretend.
But we need some more bodies.
I thought you'd like to come in there.
Uh... with all due respect, sir, may I not?
What?
Dr. Yang's testing a new protocol.
I'd learn more from watching that
than pretending to do surgery.
I mean, if you really need me to--
No.
It's okay. Go.
Thank you.
This is ridiculous.
I have had the same schedule for six years.
And now we're splitting shifts?
My husband works two jobs. Who picks up my kid now?
Pegasus breaks up shifts differently.
I don't need this.
And we get shafted. I'm not taking this.
Who's taking this?
If you know how to talk to your people,
you should start now.
I am. They keep coming back.
Cahill, chief.
Look, I'm sorry, but this is not gonna work.
No, Shepherd. I'm sorry. I've been waiting for 20 minutes.
Chief, I just wanted to ask you again
about the genetic screening.
Bailey, I'm sorry.
All right, look, I am trying to work with you.
But it cannot be now. But I'm not gonna reschedule my surgeries
so I can do a photo op.
when this hospital is on a firmer financial footing--
No, this isn't about me looking for extra credit.
It's just a couple of shots of you in action.
This is about a specific
No, you have enough pictures of me.
Bailey
If you just read the chart,
then you can talk to the stupid board...
Bailey...
and make them understand
Bailey, they didn't say no. I did.
I didn't bring it up to them
because it will not be approved.
So we're just gonna--
The answer's no, Bailey.
Yes, sir.
Never mind then.
What is it, Shepherd?
Nothing. I'm good.
It's Derek Shepherd.
I have an idea, a crazy idea,
And I need you to tell me how crazy.
This isn't weird.
I know. I wanted to meet outside the hospital.
And then with the rain--
No, I like it. It's very cloak-and-daggery.
You must be Dr.Torres.
Oh, god!
Callie Torres, Stan Grossberg.
He's my financial advisor.
I think I might have died for a second.
I asked him about the feasibility of our idea.
Stan, tell her what you told me.
Under federal law,
physicians cannot own and run the hospital
for which they work.
So we're hosed.
However, you could ally yourselves with a for-profit
or not-for-profit agency,
which would be owner pro forma.
Then the five of you could form your own management company,
which would be hired by this foundation.
So we're not hosed.
Basically, you would run the day-to-day operations,
much like a board of directors.
And again I ask, who wants to do that?
Just let him finish.
I'm sorry, but I'd rather be in an operating room than a boardroom.
Besides, I thought we didn't have enough money to do this anyway.
Well, I'm working on that.
Estimating the number of beds,
the, uh, overall operating budget,
the property and business taxes,
the franchise tax board payments...
Okay, right, right, right.
I'm asking, is it possible for us to do?
That's what he's saying. It is possible.
It is very possible.
Okay, well, how much more money would we need?
That's what I was saying, I-I don't know.
Not until I see a hospital financial statement.
How do we get that?
Owen can get that for us.
If we have a hope of outbidding Pegasus,
The element of surprise is sort of crucial here.
Owen can't know any of this.
We're gonna go behind Owen's back to steal the hospital?
No, Owen will still be chief.
He's legally obligated to tell them of anything
that might interfere with the sale.
He signed noncompetes, nondisclosures.
If he breaches them, they will fire him.
They will sue him.
There could even be jail time.
He can't know any this.
You want me to lie to him.
No, I want you to just not say anything for now.
You want me to lie to him.
The nurses aren't being unreasonable.
They have valid concerns.
And I'm worried
that you don't know how to address those concerns.
Yeah, well, I'm worried you're asking me
to sell them something that I don't even believe in.
You're a doctor.
You know sometimes you have to swallow some bitter pills
in order to get well.
This is a bad pill.
Yeah, well, why don't you tell 'em that?
They need to hear it from someone they trust.
Do you remember last week when we operated, the logger?
Before that, I didn't think that I ever would
or could step up to an O.R. table again.
I was scared the whole time,
as scared as I have ever been in my life.
I had no idea.
I know.
The only reason I was able to do it...
was because you were there,
and I barely even knew you.
But you were so calm and sure.
And if you were okay, I would be okay,
not many people have this quality.
What happened? Can I ask?
It's not a good story.
Sorry. It's none of my business.
No, I mean, it's-- it's not an interesting story.
You've heard it a hundred times.
I choked is all.
I am good at this job.
So you can believe me when I tell you
that only you can help these people understand
that something that hurts them in the short run
will help them in the long run.
When you tell someone that everything will be okay,
they'll trust you.
You know you hold this place together,
every doctor and every patient here knows that.
I know that you are the cornerstones.
I need you to be strong right now in this transition.
Transitions are scary, I know.
But believe me, I...
I would not be asking you to go through this
If I did not believe that what Pegasus Horizons offers
is the best thing for all of us.
I mean, if I didn't, I would leave with you.
I'm asking you to stay.
Trust me,
work with me.
help me get us through this.
Can we do that?
We can try.
Right?
I'll try.
Give it a go.
I can try to repair the liver,
but it's incredibly delicate,
and there's a high risk that it will be permanently damaged.
And the baby dies.
It's a risk.
The other option is, we sit tight
and hope the bleeding stops on its own.
And hope he survives that.
What?
What, what?
Say something.
Decide.
Well, I say we wait. Don't do anything.
Right.
No, that's stupid.
Do the surgery. No, I don't know.
I don't know. I can't...
I can't decide.
I can't. I can't do this.
You do it. I can't.
We both decide.
Okay? I'm scared, too.
I'm--I'm as scared as you are.
But you are the biggest, meanest, ballbusting,
ice-queen, nightmare bitch that I have ever met.
So if I can do this, you can.
Let's...
wait.
Can I have a glass of water, please?
And a maxi pad for my girlfriend here.
Nice.
Look at that.
It's bad enough that they're up there at all,
and now I have to deal with this?
We'll put a stop to it.
I'll have this one taken down.
I want them all taken down.
I didn't do it.
Do you believe it?
What do you mean?
What you said to the nurses--
"Pegasus will lead us to a brighter tomorrow."
Do you really believe that?
It is the only option that we--
Hey, it's just us now.
It's me.
No.
No, okay? No. No, I don't.
It's a bitter pill, and we just have to swallow it.
And honestly, I don't even know
if this is gonna make us better or worse.
Then why are you fighting so hard for something--
There's no other choice.
This is our only shot.
Okay, but what-- what if it wasn't, though?
What if it's not all on you to fix everything--
But it is. It is all on me.
No, Owen, Owen, listen--
I put you all on that plane.
I'm sorry. It's... Cahill.
What?
Today?
No, no, no, no, no. No, that is--
That's... amazing.
Um, I'll come find you.
What?
It's almost over.
This is so stupid.
This is the only way I can think of getting in there.
So we're in a heist movie now?
Stan needs to see the financial statements.
I will schmooze, distract, and then you--
What, stick one down my shirt?
I don't know.
All right, just... let's go. Get me in there.
Gentlemen and ladies, I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but I'd like to introduce you to my wife, Dr. Meredith Grey.
What a pleasure it is to meet you, sir.
Nice to meet you.
Oh! Oh, my goodness. Oh, oh.
I'm so sorry.
Meredith.
Oh, no. I-I am a little clumsy. I am so sorry.
They are not approving the genome mapping at this time.
But you said that--
We were sure that it was gonna go the other way.
So I'm sorry.
So now we're back to a colectomy.
I want to wait another day to see if A.J. improves,
but... it needs to be soon.
I-is that our only option?
Yeah, I'm afraid that that's--
No. There's one other option.
You can go
someplace that will find an approach that works for him,
someplace that will give him the care that he deserves.
He won't get that here.
I say leave.
Leave seattle Grace and go someplace else, fast.
What the hell was that?
That was the only medical advice I could give them in good conscience.
I'm thinking I need to take it myself.
Hey, whoa. What are you talking about?
I tried.
I tried to put on the smile and knuckle down
and make it work, but maybe I can get a job in L.A.,
Be where my husband is,
and Tuck...
Tuck's dad's never gonna let me move him out of the city--
No, no, maybe I can talk to him, right?
Maybe we can work something out.
Stop it. Stop it. You and tuck aren't going anywhere.
I don't want to work here anymore.
It makes me... feel small.
I have to make myself smaller to work here.
I-I feel like if I do that,
I feel like I won't want to look my son in the eye.
I don't recognize this place anymore
or the people.
I d--I don't want to hang around long enough
that I don't recognize myself.
I've had some sucky jobs here,
but doing nothing sucks the worst.
If his SATs stay above 3 for one more minute,
he's out of the woods.
I think it could work.
What can?
You know, people, coworkers getting together.
I mean, don't judge it from those lawyers.
They don't even like each other.
Look at Grey and Shepherd.
I mean, they tried to avoid it,
but it was like fate or whatever.
They had to be together.
It was just right, you know?
That's... beautiful.
You should write poetry or greeting cards.
I'm just saying it could work. Ten seconds.
You have a blog that I could follow?
Shut up.
You ever write poems about horses,
just pretty, pretty horses?
Shut up. Five...
Four, three, two...
One.
Yes. Yes.
Oh, shut up.
I'm sorry?
No, not you. Sorry.
April.
Tell him who you are.
If he doesn't get it, then you don't need him anyway.
But I really like him,
and... I think if I tell him, it's all gonna be over.
So wait... a little while.
Let him get to know you better.
Once he does, he's gonna want to follow you anywhere.
Trust me.
Thank you.
I could marry you again right now.
You're so hot when you're nefarious. Hold on.
Arizona wants to meet with all of us.
Where is our van?
Someone moved it.
Why?
It's what vans are for.
Hey, Bailey's quitting.
What?
If this can happen, we need to make this happen, fast.
Wait, wait. Are you in?
I'm in.
So what's the next step?
Well, we don't have enough money.
We're gonna have to find the rest somewhere else.
Can we do that in three days?
Two now. What about Cristina, is she in?
I don't know now.
Well, ask her.
It's happening, tonight.
Pegasus wants to move up the closing.
They want to buy the hospital tonight.
What?
How do you know?
Owen told me.
Well, did you say anything to him?
No, I didn't say anything,
but we have to do it, for Owen.
We have to do this now.
B-before tonight? We can't.
No, there's not enough time.
We have to stop them.
How? There's nothing that we can do.
There's one thing we can do.
Hey!
Stop right there.
We're thrilled.
Very excited.
Shall we start?
First is the letter of intent.
Sign here.
Initial here.
Oh, Dr. Shepherd. Come in. We were just--
Sorry to interrupt. I'd like to talk to Dr. Hunt for a second.
Um, what's up?
Guys?
I'd like to tender my resignation,
effective immediately.
Me, too. I quit.
I quit, too.
Me, too.
I quit, too.
He thinks we stabbed him in the back.
Well, all we did was buy some time
to slow down the sale,
so we can come up with the money.
I know. I know.
All right, Stan says he can meet with us now.
Okay, I'll go get my stuff.
Yeah, we get all our stuff 'cause we just quit.
What about our patients?
We'll get 'em covered by someone.
Dr. Shepherd,
This young man has something to say to you.
Did you get them all?
Pretty much.
Good work, Ross. Go home.
Something's going on here.
What's going on?
You'll know soon.
Did you see the look on his face?
Oh, Richard will be fine.
No, Owen.
This is wrong.
I'm gonna go talk to him. I have to explain.
No. Cristina, no.
It's the right thing to do, for his sake.
When the time is right, we'll tell him,
And he'll understand.
I don't know if he will.
Wait.
Nothing. Never mind. Sorry.
Okay, we should, um...
We should, though,
Uh, stop.
Okay, there's something I have to tell you.
I don't want to,
'cause I think it might be the last I see of you.
This is only gonna go so far tonight.
God.
'cause I am, uh...
Saving myself for marriage.
Oh, god.
Oh, dear god.
Yeah, uh, I know.
It's weird.
And it's not something you hear every day,
but it is something that I believe in.
And I can completely understand
if you can't hang with that.
No. No, I can.
I can hang. I do.
I, I am, too.
Are you messing with me right now?
No. No.
I am, too.
Only there's, um...
there's just this one thing.
What?
Nothing.
I am, too.
What the hell was that?
Did you know that they were gonna pull that?
There's a way to salvage this.
Salvage what?
They withdrew the offer.
Losing those surgeons, losing shepherd,
Completely changes the value of the hospital.
You'd better do something
and fast.
There's--there's no way
that we can replace them.
There's, um...
I can't reposition.
I can't find new buyers.
By tomorrow morning, the whole industry will know.
I can't. I can't.
You have to.
You say this is what you're good at.
It better be, because everyone that I thought was in my corner
Just walked out,
And you are all that I have now.
So either go and get Pegasus back,
or find another buyer.
You say you trust me.
Then trust me when I say
you can do this,
because you have to.
They say that negotiation is an art form.
Yet, when we negotiate...
His B.P. Looks good. His labs look great.
We'll watch him closely overnight,
But I think he's gonna be just fine.
Thank you.
We have a strategy, we use tactics.
All right, can you please move your fat head
so I can get a look?
Tool.
That's gonna be fun.
I'm especially excited for that kid's next 18 years.
Hey, you want to go get a beer?
Oh, I would love to, especially after today,
but, actually
already have plans.
Tomorrow night? Is that cool?
Yeah, that's cool.
Okay.
Hey. Who is that guy?
That is...
Chest peckwell.
What?
It's not his real name.
We just called him that before we knew it.
O.B. Resident.
Jo's been mooning over the guy since he got here,
And she finally grew herself a pair and asked him out.
Yay, Jo.
She didn't tell you about him?
Yeah, she did.
"Strategies" And "Tactics"
Aren't words we use for seeking a compromise.
Cristina!
Cristina!
Cristina!
Those are words for going to war.
The first thing you'll need to do is to form an L.L.C.
So that you can legally get all your funds in one place.
And you'll need a name for your new corporation.
What did we just do?
Do you know what you'd like to call yourselves?
How about "The bitter pills"?
"Epic failure"?
"Death spiral"?
"Blind leading the blind, incorporated"?
