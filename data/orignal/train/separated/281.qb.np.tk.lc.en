max .
it &apos;s the woman at table 2 &apos;s 50th birthday
and her husband wants us to sing to her .
if i had a dollar every time a man asked me
to do something to his wife ,
i &apos;d be a millionaire .
i remember when happy birthday first came up .
i never thought it would catch on .
go !
and smile .
when you fake smile ,
everybody else fakes smile back .
nobody wants to hear that lame song .
if we want to humiliate her in public ,
why don &apos;t we go over there and pull her top down ?
come on , let &apos;s just go sing and make the best of it .
hi . ready ?
one , two , three ...
happy birthday to you ...
whoa !
ma &apos;am , i apologize .
it &apos;s hard enough your husband took you to a diner on your birthday
and now you have to listen to white mariah ?
no !
cupcake &apos;s on me .
to yoooooooou
i have announcement to make .
i agree with what max said before .
what ? that we should tie a little bell around you ,
so we know when you &apos;re near ?
that &apos;s the happy birthday song is very lame .
the diner needs a fresh , new way
to celebrate the customer birthday .
so i just went and wrote a special song .
han , i &apos;d be happy to look at what you &apos;ve written so far .
i took music theory in college .
i once wrote an entire original musical
based on the french revolution .
um , sorry to step on your nerd turf ,
but les mis is already a musical about the french revolution .
于上世纪八十年代被改编成音乐剧
yes , but mine was from the point of view of the rich .
what are you going to rewrite next--
the musical rent from the point of view of the landlord ?
han , this is a lovely start , but--
a lovely start ?
no , i mean , it &apos;s good .
but not good enough .
i know what you are saying .
&quot; you need to practice more , han .
&quot; you never will be as good as your sister , han .
&quot; whole family going on vacation
without you while you practice , han . &quot;
back off , tiger mom !
指用严格的东方式教育来养育孩子的母亲
hey , caroline , is max around ?
um , she might be . i &apos;ll go check .
you &apos;ll never guess who just came into the restaurant .
you &apos;ll be very happy .
gary , the fat guy from teen mom ?
someone you like , someone you want to kiss ,
someone you &apos;re hot for .
tyler , the skinny guy from teen mom ?
what &apos;s johnny doing here ?
i told him not to show his face unless--
unless he broke up with his girlfriend .
and now he &apos;s here , showing his face ,
which means--
you can &apos;t know that for sure .
fine . tell me one other reason he could possibly be in here .
he needs han to solve a complex math problem ?
max !
max , it &apos;s pretty obvious that he &apos;s in here
because he broke up with his girlfriend &quot; cassandra &quot;
i mean , what else could it be ?
when i had millions of dollars ,
i had no idea why guys were coming to see me .
&quot; do they want me , or do they want my money ? &quot;
but you have nothing !
so basically that just leaves you .
way to puff me up before i go through that door .
this is so exciting .
will you stop ? don &apos;t be such a girl .
hair ? teeth ? anything ?
you &apos;re good .
wait .
more .
really ?
trust me .
oh , uh , hey , johnny . when did you get here ?
uh , just now .
i , uh--i came here
because i want to tell you something .
yes ?
max , i think you and i have something special .
and i don &apos;t want to lose that .
so i came down here to ask ...
even though it didn &apos;t work out ,
can we still be friends ?
what ?
you have got to be kidding !
what &apos;s going on over there , caroline ?
my friend johnny and i have no idea
what you &apos;re upset about .
i was just reacting to the news that we &apos;re out of pie .
i really cannot believe it .
i totally thought it would go a different way .
caroline ...
why don &apos;t you go over there to the pie carrousel
and mourn the loss of our pie ?
so , we &apos;re cool ?
yeah , we &apos;re cool . why wouldn &apos;t we be ?
we never dated or anything like that .
of course we &apos;re friends .
i am so relieved .
so , uh , you gonna go back
to busting my balls , like always ?
yes .
we &apos;re such good friends , i might just ...
bust them with my feet !
good morning .
i &apos;m trying to send out a get @-@ to @-@ know @-@ us email blast
for the cupcake business .
but your wi @-@ fi is so slow .
don &apos;t tell me-- tell cathyhome17,
whoever and wherever she is .
okay , well , i &apos;m just going to run down to
the coffee place and send it .
do you approve ?
nice job . the font &apos;s pretty .
you just gave me a compliment ?
i knew it-- you &apos;re depressed .
you &apos;re so depressed about you and johnny just being friends ,
you don &apos;t even have the energy to be you .
what ? the font is pretty .
oh , honey , do you want a hug ?
i &apos;m fine .
how could you be fine ?
the man was so into you ,
he painted a billboard of the two of you kissing .
and now he just wants to be friends ?
please call in sick to your babysitting job
and take to the bed .
whenever i used to get depressed ,
i &apos;d take to the bed .
one time , i took to the bed for a week .
listen , unlike you , jane austen ,
i will never take to the bed .
giving in to feelings is for rich people .
regular people just have to get up ,
get drunk , and go fulfill their babysitting duties .
max , take to the bed .
look , this is my pattern , okay ?
i fall for the wrong guy ,
i find out they &apos;re with a girl , a bottle , or a needle ,
and i move on .
and sometimes i use a bottle to help me do it ...
or a needle or a girl .
but when i &apos;m done , i &apos;m done .
that &apos;s it ?
you &apos;re just over it ?
i &apos;m still sad because kyle enright
didn &apos;t invite me on his private jet
to mykonos for his 12th birthday .
well , not me .
just flip a switch and those feelings are gone .
i only have two switches in my life--
one turns off my emotions ,
the other makes a car bounce .
okay , i better go .
if you get there after 10 : 30 , you can &apos;t hear yourself think
over the sounds of people skyping to the philippines .
max , are you sure you &apos;re all right ?
max .
are you about to come over here and soft @-@ touch me ?
i want to so bad .
leave !
go to the coffee place . soft @-@ touch the barista .
excuse me , miss .
you keep your door open like that ,
this rat &apos;s probably going to get inside .
don &apos;t worry . you should see the size of my cat .
what are you doing here ?
i knew you &apos;d be home for another hour ,
so i brought you coffee .
and i wanted to say ...
thanks for understanding the situation .
hey , you don &apos;t need to get all
&quot; hallmark presents : johnny soft eyes &quot; on me .
okay ? you &apos;re not my type , anyway .
you &apos;re a bartender who &apos;s close to liquor all night
and your not an alcoholic .
so clearly you don &apos;t know how to seize an opportunity .
yes , i do .
this is where you join in birthday song
with your sweet @-@ ass saxophone .
han , i like you , brother ,
but i played with everyone
from marvin gaye to the gay marvins .
they never made it--a little bit ahead of their time .
but if you don &apos;t mind a professional opinion , man ,
you &apos;ve got to put some heart into this thing .
but my mother always say to run away from heart--
only the head can make music .
han , your mother sounds like one cold--
don &apos;t you talk about my mama !
hey , earl . what &apos;s up ?
i just got threatened by
a man who gets carded at pixar movies .
max , great news--
that email blast i sent out this morning worked .
i just got us a big cupcake job
at some event place called the gold space loft .
last time i was at the gold space loft ,
i went to a poetry slam , and i wound up slamming a poet .
they need 100 cupcakes by tomorrow night .
and because i &apos;m a genius ,
and also because it &apos;s such short notice--
but mostly because i &apos;m a genius--
i got them up to $ 500 .
it &apos;s a cool group art show--
very williamsburg , very pot brownie .
and johnny has a piece in it .
and since you flipped your switch ,
i figured it &apos;d be fine .
no way . i can &apos;t make 100 cupcakes in a day .
max , i know it &apos;s a lot of work ,
but i &apos;ll do whatever i can to help .
this is a really big opportunity for us .
i kissed johnny .
what ? when ?
he came by the apartment right after you left .
i was only gone 20 minutes .
what &apos;d you do--shine a bat symbol on your vagina ?
stop acting like i wanted it to happen .
i didn &apos;t want it to happen . i &apos;m lucky we just kissed .
my pants kept saying , &quot; take me off ! &quot;
and i &apos;m like , &quot; no , pants . &quot;
i &apos;m telling you , i almost couldn &apos;t help myself .
i don &apos;t understand .
i thought you said you were done with him .
what happened to your pattern ?
telling people i have a pattern is part of the pattern .
then i just go and do whatever i want .
i knew it , i thought it , i should have said it--
girls cannot be friends with guys .
yeah , well , you also knew he was coming in here
to tell me he broke up with his girlfriend .
so you can suck it .
did he say he was going to break up with her ?
we didn &apos;t get into it .
we weren &apos;t really using our mouths for talking .
what do you think &apos;s going to happen ?
i don &apos;t know .
all i know is it &apos;s not going to happen at a public art show
in front of him and his beautiful , cool british girlfriend .
max , you don &apos;t even have to see them .
we &apos;ll get there early , we &apos;ll drop off the cupcakes ,
and be gone before any of the artists even show up .
great . i &apos;m going home tonight
after my ten @-@ hour waitress shift ,
to stay up all night and bake 100 cupcakes
for a guy i kissed who has a girlfriend .
beep .
ooh , what &apos;s that ? my self @-@ esteem just flatlined .
yeah , it &apos;s this way .
i smell patchouli and pretension .
why are you walking so slow ?
because i &apos;m carrying our cupcake future ,
and i don &apos;t want half of our future &apos;s frosting
to be on top of the box .
relax . we still have time .
oh , hello .
welcome to space blast art attack .
the gallery won &apos;t be open for , like , an hour .
actually , we &apos;re here delivering the cupcakes .
we &apos;re looking for someone named traivor .
and i &apos;m looking for traivor &apos;s mom ,
to ask her why she named a person traivor .
traive !
you girls can set up inside .
he &apos;s the one with the super @-@ tall hat .
i love galleries .
my father and i had an art foundation .
we taught blind kids how to do ceramics .
why didn &apos;t you just buy them eyes ?
let &apos;s put them here .
this art show is ridiculous--
someone named traivor ,
a dreamcatcher with buzzwords stuck in it .
and you .
why would he hang that picture of us
if he still has a girlfriend ?
maybe he went home and broke up with her
after he kissed you .
the writing is literally on the wall .
oh , no , no , no . i &apos;m not falling for you again .
let &apos;s just get our money and go .
grown lady dressed like a doll ,
we can &apos;t find tall hat ,
and we need to get paid for the cupcakes and leave .
leave ? what are you talking about .
you &apos;re serving the cupcakes .
pardon ?
well , why do you think we &apos;re paying you $ 500 for cupcakes ?
because my friend &apos;s a genius .
this is new information .
we need to talk to someone . traive !
oh , no . traive is busy installing his ice penis .
i could get someone else on the show committee to help .
cashandra !
what &apos;s his girlfriend doing here ?
oh , god !
what if soft eyes wussed out and told her what happened ?
does she look mad ?
no , she looks amazing .
max , hello .
we met that one time on the street .
cashandra , johnny &apos;s girlfriend .
oh , hi , hi . i &apos;m johnny &apos;s friend .
we &apos;re just friends .
hi , &quot; cassandra . &quot; i &apos;m caroline .
i was with max on the street .
and all day yesterday .
we were together every minute .
it &apos;s cash @-@ andra , actually .
but everyone calls me cash .
and you &apos;re max &apos;s business partner , right ?
yeah , but she makes her own decisions .
right . well , let &apos;s just get to it , shall we ?
i &apos;m a bleeder .
it &apos;s brilliant it all worked out
with the cupcakes .
excuse me ?
well , i told traive to hire you for the show .
johnny cannot stop talking about your cupcakes , max .
&quot; max &apos;s cupcakes are so moist . &quot;
&quot; max &apos;s cupcakes are delicious . &quot;
he loves your cupcakes .
yeah , yeah .
but just like in a casual way .
i mean , he barely even touched them .
so , um , i &apos;m a bit busy getting ready for the show .
why don &apos;t you put your little cupcakes on these trays ,
and when people start coming in , circulate , right ?
circulate , girls , circulate .
well , that wasn &apos;t uncomfortable .
come on , let &apos;s bolt before johnny gets here ,
while i at least have a shred of my dignity .
we can &apos;t just bail out of our first big job .
if we do , people will think we &apos;re flakes .
and that &apos;ll spread faster through williamsburg
than knit hats and herpes .
hey , you ladies know where the wine goes ?
right here .
yeah .
no ! just , uh , not the wine . the wine &apos;s mine .
just serving cupcakes .
i &apos;ve been listening in on cashandra and her girlfriends &apos; conversations ,
and i don &apos;t think she knows anything happened between you two .
i also learned she &apos;s a dancer ,
her lip gloss is from kiehl &apos;s ,
and she &apos;s school chums with adele .
not the adele .
damn it ! could she be any cooler ?
i want her to be my girlfriend .
i wouldn &apos;t break up with her for me .
hi . i &apos;m here .
great . i was hoping tonight would get weirder .
i had no idea .
she did it to surprise me .
and she did-- i &apos;m surprised .
i am so sorry .
you have a girlfriend . why are you kissing max ?
you told her ?
oh , oh , i &apos;m sorry .
would the more subtle way be to paint a picture
and hang it on the wall for all to see ?
are you insane ?
could we have a moment , please ?
fine .
i &apos;ll be over there near the ice penis .
look , i am so sorry .
if i had known cash was going to ask you to do all of this ,
i would have told you .
and why would you choose to hang that ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s my favorite piece .
is there any way she could know what happened ?
no .
oh , my god . your lips .
split up .
i can smell the sex from across the room .
no @-@ whoa @-@ whoa ! i need all those .
so what ? is she still your girlfriend ?
max , it &apos;s complicated .
what , are we on facebook ?
其中一项为 &quot; 很复杂 &quot;
it is complicated .
cash and i have been together two years , and when--
two years ?
jeez , i &apos;m a home wrecker .
adele will probably write a song about me .
you &apos;re not a homewrecker .
i am .
johnny !
you &apos;ve got some folks .
circulate , max , circulate .
that &apos;s it . this is over .
that--us on the wall-- never happens again .
i lied . i can &apos;t be your friend .
i was trying to be cool , but i &apos;m not cool .
i don &apos;t know adele .
what just happened over there ?
did he tell you he &apos;s breaking up with his girlfriend ?
no . what &apos;s wrong with you ?
you haven &apos;t been right about anything ?
i told him we are done , and that &apos;s over , okay ?
they &apos;ve been together two years .
and i know one thing about me--
i may pick the wrong guys ,
but when i hear another woman is involved ,
i am done .
this is truly the end of my pattern .
we have to go-- i kissed johnny again .
what ? max , you said you were going to the bathroom .
i did . and so did he .
it &apos;s a unisex bathroom--
emphasis on the sex .
we have to go .
i &apos;m a little drunk and out of control .
traive said we won &apos;t get paid
until every single one of the cupcakes is gone .
so we &apos;re stuck here .
fine .
i shall go circulate .
no . you cannot be trusted .
next thing i know , you &apos;ll be doing him behind the ice penis .
i &apos;m telling you , i am done .
you told me that five minutes ago .
well , you told me he was breaking up
with his girlfriend three times .
so i guess we learned tonight that you know nothing about him ,
and i know nothing about me .
cheers !
wait for me .
hello , girls .
traivor told me you were looking to get paid .
but just to be clear , you can &apos;t actually be paid
until all the cupcakes are gone .
and do me a favor , love ,
put a chocolate aside for johnny .
he loves chocolate .
he &apos;ll eat a vanilla if it &apos;s available ,
but he always goes back to chocolate .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s going to break up with her .
really ?
you have the accuracy rate of a magic 8 ball .
暗想问题 晃一晃便会出现随机的预设答案
look at her . she &apos;s so pretty .
and bitchy . and ...
more pretty than bitchy .
oh , god . she just zipped his hoodie
and fixed his hair-- that &apos;s a couple .
what they have is real .
they are a couple-- johnny and cash .
oh @-@ ho , crap ! johnny cash !
they &apos;re an institution .
i never had a chance .
forget the money-- let &apos;s just go .
mm @-@ mmm .
we are staying till these cupcakes are gone .
i am not leaving with no dignity and no money .
fine , i &apos;ll circulate a couple more times .
wait a minute .
they said they had to be gone ,
but they didn &apos;t say who had to make them gone .
we eat them and go !
you &apos;re doing it ! i rescued you from the gutter .
uh , well , that &apos;s not entirely accura--
max , wake up .
it &apos;s 3 : 00 .
we forgot to set the alarm .
oh , i never thought waking up in bed with another woman with ...
frosting on my boobs , would be this depressing .
how are you feeling about it all today ?
do you want to talk ?
no .
good .
where &apos;s your purse ?
i &apos;m going to take some of the money we made last night
and get coffee . and yes--
i am walking down the street like this ,
because after last night , i am impenetrable to shame .
wait , we don &apos;t have any money .
yes , we do .
no , we don &apos;t .
we did , but we don &apos;t .
i bought something with it .
i bought this .
you carried that home ? where was i ?
three blocks ahead of me ,
telling strangers about your pattern .
i saw you and johnny just hanging there ,
and i knew what i had to do .
so what , am i supposed to hang that up ?
no . you &apos;re supposed to destroy it .
you need to get over him , so you &apos;re going to kick this ,
and then you &apos;re going to kick him once and for all .
you want to break your pattern ?
start by breaking the painting .
that is a complete waste of money .
i may have been wrong about everything else about johnny ,
but i &apos;m right about this . come on .
kick it .
i can &apos;t .
give me your foot .
what ?
lift up your leg .
yay ! you did it .
good for you !
you broke a painting and maybe your pattern .
i really liked him .
i know .
i slept through my day job , so what the heck ?
i think i will take to the bed or whatever .
just for like 20 minutes .
i &apos;ll set my alarm and then i &apos;ll get up
and get ready for work .
max , please , i feel like we need a hug .
we just slept together ! you women are so needy .
