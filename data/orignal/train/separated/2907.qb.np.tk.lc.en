oh , hey ! how was your audition ?
i &apos;m sorry , do i know you ?
what are you doing ?
practicing blowing you off . i &apos;m gonna be a big movie star !
you got it ?
not yet , but the audition went great !
what &apos;s it for ?
a big @-@ budget period movie about three italian brothers ...
who come to america at the turn of the century . it &apos;s classy .
the director &apos;s supposed to be the next @-@ next martin scorsese .
the &quot; next @-@ next &quot; ?
a guy from chicago &apos;s supposed to be the next martin scorsese .
this guy &apos;s right after him .
hello ?
joey , it &apos;s estelle . i just talked to the casting people . they loved you !
they loved me !
they want to see you again tomorrow .
my god !
there &apos;s just one thing .
do you have a problem with full @-@ frontal nudity ?
are you kidding me ? i never rent a movie without it !
oh .
okay , let me call you back .
what &apos;s the matter ?
they want me naked in the movie .
wow !
i know .
my grandmother &apos;s gonna see this .
grandma &apos;s gonna have to get in line .
the one with ross and monica &apos;s cousin
the wedding &apos;s so close . are you nervous ?
yeah , but i also can &apos;t wait till it &apos;s over .
we have a pact not to have sex again until the wedding .
a &quot; no sex &quot; pact , huh ?
i have one of those with every woman in america .
will you give me a hand making up the guest bedroom ?
cousin cassie &apos;s staying with us for a few days .
cassie ? i haven &apos;t seen her in , like , forever .
i wonder if she still carries a barbie everywhere ?
she &apos;s 25 years old .
so ? i still ..
you &apos;re probably right .
phoebe , can i talk to you over here for a second ?
subtle , guys .
what ?
i know you &apos;re planning my surprise bridal shower .
okay , well , don &apos;t ruin it . just play along , at least .
okay . sorry .
we have to throw her a shower ?
what &apos;d you decide to do about the movie ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s not like it &apos;s porn . this is a serious , legitimate movie .
nudity &apos;s really important to the story .
that &apos;s what you say about porn .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t go on the callback .
no , you should . a lot of major actors do nude scenes .
the chance to star in a movie ? come on !
that &apos;s true . and i &apos;m only naked in one scene . it sounds really great .
my character &apos;s catholic . he falls in love with a jewish girl .
we run away and get caught in a big rainstorm .
we go into a barn , undress each other and hold each other .
it &apos;s really sweet and tender .
plus , everyone will see your thing !
when can we have this shower ?
she has so much going on , we have only two options .
we have friday .
that &apos;s just two days away .
what is the other option ?
yesterday .
if we make it yesterday , we &apos;re done !
it &apos;s impossible . we can &apos;t do this by friday .
we have to find a place , invite people , get food .
there &apos;s too much to do .
we cannot do it !
calm down !
okay . i &apos;m sorry , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
just calm down , woman !
phoebe , i already did .
all right , then i need to calm down .
i think we can do this if we just get organized .
we have two days to plan this party . we need to make fast decisions .
where will we have it ?
here . what time ?
4 : 00 . food ?
finger sandwiches and tea .
great ! very monica .
and chili !
you went one too far .
flowers or balloons ?
both .
we &apos;re paying for this .
neither .
what should we do for a theme ?
lusts of the flesh !
what ?
i don &apos;t know . cowboy theme ?
i &apos;m glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding .
oh , boy . me too .
i was thinking , say we had a big fight , and broke up for a few hours .
technically , we could have sex again .
what do you think , bossy and domineering ?
the wedding &apos;s off , sloppy and immature .
that &apos;s me . come on .
wait . cassie &apos;s in the guest room . we &apos;re going to lunch .
get rid of her , obsessive and shrill !
shrill ? the wedding is back on .
i thought i heard voices . you must be chandler .
hi . nice to meet you .
nice to meet you too .
so , ready to go ?
yeah .
chandler ?
i &apos;ll be right with you .
cassie needs to stay at your place .
why ?
because &quot; pervie perverson &quot; here can &apos;t stop staring at her .
chandler , she &apos;s our cousin !
i wasn &apos;t staring . i was listening intently .
it &apos;s called being a good conversationalist . watch .
say something .
you were staring about eight inches south of there .
fine . she can stay at my place .
what does cassie look like now ?
exactly like aunt marilyn .
this aunt marilyn , is she coming to the wedding ?
wafer @-@ thin ice .
hey , i &apos;m back .
hi , joey .
will i read the same scene again ?
i tried to call you . you didn &apos;t need to come today .
oh , great .
i &apos;d have been perfect for this part .
you made a bad decision and ruined your movie . good day !
you didn &apos;t need to come , because the director saw your tape and loved it .
end scene .
wasn &apos;t that fun ? we did a little improv there . yeah !
so , you were saying ?
the director wants to meet you tomorrow .
wow ! sure ! that &apos;s great .
your agent said you &apos;re okay with nudity .
yeah , sure . as long as it &apos;s handled tastefully .
and that barn is not too cold .
perfect . there &apos;s one more thing .
it &apos;s important to the director that everything in the movie &apos;s authentic .
in your love scene with sarah ...
she talks about how she &apos;s never seen a naked man who wasn &apos;t jewish .
so ...
so ... what ?
so , the director is insisting that whoever play that part ...
be authentically , anatomically ...
not jewish . you know what i &apos;m saying ?
yes !
no . what ?
an italian catholic immigrant at this time would not be ....
bar mitzvah @-@ ed ?
think 13 years earlier , lose the rabbi , add a scalpel .
to get this part , you can &apos;t be ..
no .
but you are ?
you told them you weren &apos;t ?
that &apos;s right .
wow !
it &apos;s definitely all gone ? there &apos;s nothing there to work with ?
what were you thinking ?
i don &apos;t know . i just want this part .
they say no matter what you &apos;re asked during an audition , say yes .
they want you to ride a horse , say you can .
you figure out how to do it later .
this is not like learning to ride a horse . this is like learning to ...
grow a turtleneck .
i know , okay ? tomorrow , when i go meet the director ...
i have to take my clothes off so they can see what my body looks like .
oh , my god . what are you gonna do ?
i have to call my agent and tell her i can &apos;t do the part .
unless ...
unless what ?
this may sound crazy , but there may be something we could ...
fashion .
like what ?
well , i &apos;m not sure yet .
off the top of my head , i &apos;m thinking ...
double @-@ sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat .
i &apos;ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower .
we get mahogany boxes and carve everyone &apos;s names in them .
then inside is each person &apos;s individual birthstone .
okay . okay .
you take care of that .
meanwhile , the party &apos;s tomorrow and we don &apos;t have a guest list .
okay . who do we know that &apos;s coming ? me . are you ?
hey .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m making something for joey . can i raid your fridge ?
have at it .
all right . turkey ? that won &apos;t work .
cheese ? that won &apos;t work .
olive loaf ? i hope that won &apos;t work .
are you making him a sandwich ?
no , it &apos;s more like a wrap .
okay , so i &apos;m gonna go , guys .
so you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present !
we have to get her a present ?
okay , but look . look at what i got .
it &apos;s her address book . we have a guest list .
you &apos;re amazing . did you pull that out of her purse ?
uh @-@ huh . and a little seed money for the party .
cassie ?
hey , ross !
it &apos;s been so long !
last time i saw you ...
you were setting up your tent in line for return of the jedi .
so you did see me that day . because it seemed like you didn &apos;t .
yeah , sorry about that .
it &apos;s okay . come on in .
thanks for letting me stay here . monica &apos;s place was nice .
but her fiance sure stares a lot .
oh , my god ! you do a great chandler !
i have a knack for impressions .
maybe after we get re @-@ acquainted you could do me .
yeah . no !
how you doing on that ...
hot dog ?
i &apos;m all done .
thank god .
the last time we hung out was when our parents rented that beach house .
remember the time i pinned you down and tickled you until you cried ?
we &apos;re probably too old to do that now .
i &apos;ll always remember that summer . it &apos;s when i got all these freckles .
i &apos;ll always remember that summer ...
because that &apos;s when i realized that we are related .
you know , we &apos;re not just two random people thrown together .
we share genetic material .
it took you that long to figure it out ?
i &apos;m a little slow .
just as our children would be .
hi .
hi .
how are you ? good . hi . thanks for coming .
thank you . so nice to see you .
no , thanks .
okay . hey , rach ?
yeah ?
who the hell are all these people ?
i don &apos;t know . i called everybody in her book .
these are the ones that could show up on 24 hours &apos; notice .
there &apos;s a word for people like that : losers .
hi , i &apos;m rachel . this is phoebe . i &apos;m the maid of honor .
how do you know monica ?
i was her accountant four years ago .
i &apos;m interested to find out who &apos;s been doing her taxes the last four years .
that &apos;s great .
when is monica supposed to get here ?
i don &apos;t know .
excuse us .
you didn &apos;t tell her ?
you were supposed to .
you were supposed to tell her to come ! i was bringing the cake !
fine , i &apos;ll go call her .
and please tell her to bring a cake !
we have a lot of options . a number of prototypes for you to try on .
those look great .
okay , this one &apos;s a mushroom cap . this one is made of bologna .
the toothpicks ?
just until the glue dries .
thank god .
these are more realistic , but perishable .
over here , we have pink suede , which is nice .
but if it gets wet , it &apos;ll shrink .
maybe we &apos;ll just take that one away .
i also did a little something in fur , but that &apos;s really just for me .
why don &apos;t you try these on ? we &apos;ll get a better idea of what works .
thanks , you are such a good friend . and this is so weird .
okay , the taffy &apos;s too sticky .
i was afraid of that .
toothpick ?
yeah .
what are you trying now ?
the fruit roll @-@ up .
and ?
delicious .
wait a minute . wait a minute . we have a winner !
what ? which one ?
the silly putty . not so silly anymore !
she &apos;s your cousin . she &apos;s your cousin .
if she knew what was going on in your head , she &apos;d think you were sick .
or would she ? let &apos;s back up for a second .
she was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine .
she was the one who turned down the lights .
she was the one that wanted to rent logan &apos;s run ...
the sexiest movie ever .
i know that look .
forget it . i want it . she wants it .
i &apos;m going in .
what the hell are you doing ?
say something clever .
okay , doesn &apos;t have to be clever .
just has to be words . say some words .
any words will do .
oh , my god , this is the longest ...
that anyone has not talked ever !
there is nothing you could say to make this worse ...
so just say something !
i haven &apos;t had sex in a very long time .
yeah , you really shouldn &apos;t have said anything .
phoebe ? rachel ? it &apos;s monica .
i wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice ?
oh , monica . we are so sorry .
for what ?
first , for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower .
then , forgetting to invite you to it .
you already had it ?
we called everyone in your phone book . a bunch of people came .
it took us so long to get you here that they had to leave .
we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower .
now you don &apos;t have either .
we ruined everything .
no , wait a minute , that &apos;s not true . what you did was really sweet .
it kind of works out for the best .
what do you mean ?
now i get to spend my shower with the only people i really love .
i get all those presents without talking to people i don &apos;t even like !
surprise .
surprise , monica .
what &apos;s cool is , the character is from naples , right ?
my whole family &apos;s from naples .
that &apos;s great . okay . i &apos;ve heard everything i need to hear ...
we just need to , uh ...
leslie ?
joey , this is the awkward part .
hey , right . not a problem .
i totally understand you need to ...
make sure i don &apos;t have any horrible scars or tattoos .
don &apos;t you worry .
i have nothing to hide .
so , there you go . that &apos;s me .
one hundred @-@ percent natural .
i tell you , that has never happened before .
cassie , are you finding everything okay ?
yeah . thanks for letting me stay here .
oh , it &apos;s no problem .
what ?
say something . say anything .
