your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
dan &apos;s serial is continuing in &quot; vanity fair . &quot;
dan , we had a deal .
&quot; vanity fair &quot; is the big time ,
and the more readers i have ,
the more power i have . it is that simple .
dan wrote the truth . we are together .
and i want you by my side ,
here and at the gallery opening .
are you dan humphrey ?
i am .
i read your piece in &quot; the spectator &quot; today .
can i buy you a drink ?
absolutely .
did this really happen ? you and serena ?
every dirty detail , exactly as it occurred .
she said she erased it , but did you actually see her do it ?
what is wrong with you ?
you had someone who loved you unconditionally ,
and you threw that all away
to let chuck bass decide when he &apos;s ready for you ?
i just have a few questions about a weekend
you spent with bart in dubai about four years ago .
dave drove bart to meet someone named lady alexander .
i don &apos;t know who she is or even where to start looking for her .
we will find her .
and who am i ?
that &apos;s a secret i &apos;ll never tell .
you know you love me .
extra , extra , read all about it--
the latest upper east sider to take center stage
in the social spotlight .
but you know what they say ?
if you can &apos;t take the heat , then move to hell &apos;s kitchen .
&quot; nate archibald has the opposite of the midas touch .
&quot; instead of everything he touches turning to gold ,
he turns all the gold he &apos;s been given to dust . &quot;
your friend &apos;s poor , right ?
i mean , he &apos;s probably just jealous .
oh , first of all , dan screwed me over
by selling the serialization of his new book
right out from under me ,
and then he releases the chapter about me .
you look really hot in the picture .
who cares what it says ?
he &apos;s saying that
i &apos;m singlehandedly destroying &quot; the spectator . &quot;
okay , enough . this dan guy is full of it .
no , actually , if he was making stuff up ,
you know , i &apos;d be mad , but i &apos;d get over it .
thing is , he &apos;s right .
&quot; the spectator &quot; is in serious financial trouble ,
and it &apos;s all my fault .
it &apos;s why i &apos;m meeting with the bank later today
to hopefully extend our credit line .
can i help ? please .
i am dying for an excuse to skip brunch
with my dad and serena van der floozy .
no , that &apos;s nice , but you should go to brunch ,
and you should be nice to serena , all right ?
she &apos;s the one who convinced your dad
to let us keep dating , all right ? give her a chance .
your article on nate
is generating major online buzz .
huffpo has a link on their main page ,
and dwight garner just tweeted about it ,
saying that he &apos;s halfway through and doesn &apos;t hate it yet .
even &quot; gossip girl &quot; gave us a nice plug .
overall , the reaction &apos;s been positive ...
for you , that is . not for nate .
are they talking about how the use of real names
makes this my &quot; in cold blood &quot; ?
i mean , do they like the writing ?
are they making any comparisons to historical literary figures ?
perez hilton . but the important thing
is that they &apos;re talking about it .
literary celebrity is fleeting .
we have to make the most of it .
trust me . i have been .
i am not talking about trolling for
lit groupies at mcnally &apos;s
and sleeping with your coffee dates .
well , that &apos;s how i &apos;m finding a bed to sleep in every night .
look , being a writer in 2012
isn &apos;t merely about the words that you write .
it &apos;s about your image .
so from now on , you &apos;re only going to be seen with girls
who have ivy league pedigrees , or , at the very least , vassar .
she needs to have cover girl looks
and at least three mentions in &quot; page six &quot;
in the last six months .
how exactly am i gonna do that ?
i &apos;ve already set up the interviews .
this is the guy my daughter &apos;s dating ?
have you read this article on nate ?
oh , i &apos;m not a fan of the author &apos;s previous work .
well , let me summarize for you .
his last girlfriend was a madam .
before that , he dated con artists with an &quot; s &quot;
because , yes , there was more than one .
your friend dan wrote all this ?
dan humphrey &apos;s a douche .
well , you can forget
about dating the guy in this article ever again .
that &apos;s fine by me .
nate is nothing like the guy in that article .
well , i don &apos;t know what dan wrote , but i can vouch for nate .
he &apos;s kind and honest and a good friend .
and--and he cares about sage a lot .
you should get to know him before you judge him .
or at least before you hit him again .
dad , can he come to the horse show with us ?
this afternoon ?
no , that &apos;s always been our thing .
oh , come on . you hate it , and you know it .
it &apos;ll give you someone to talk about football with instead .
nate loves football .
see ? look , we &apos;re already finding things to bond over .
oh , i guess he can join us .
it &apos;ll give me a chance to talk to him .
possibly threaten his life .
i &apos;ll see if he can come .
thanks , dad .
you , too , serena .
did you see that ?
she almost smiled at me .
and don &apos;t worry about nate . you &apos;ll really like him .
he &apos;s the best .
well , you would know . when were you gonna tell me
you &apos;ve had sex with my daughter &apos;s boyfriend ?
this is definitely a @-@ a fire hazard .
i think it &apos;s time to unpack the boxes lily sent over .
sorry , i &apos;ve been so busy with this new gallery opening .
i &apos;m actually headed over there now .
don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but maybe you &apos;re using the gallery as an excuse
to avoid going through your old life .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
is it ?
these boxes are full of
stuff from your time with lily ,
and i can see how revisiting those memories could be difficult .
look , let me help . i will unpack the boxes ,
and when you come back , they &apos;ll be gone .
that would be nice .
keep the things that we can use around the loft
and just throw everything else out .
gosh .
&quot; may 17 , 2008 .
dear rufus , last night was the best night of my life . &quot;
it &apos;s kind of a big deal not to mention .
i wasn &apos;t trying to hide my past with nate .
i swear it was a long time ago .
we &apos;re just friends now , and besides ,
when is something like that supposed to come up ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe the second he started dating my daughter ?
sage knows , and she doesn &apos;t care .
i don &apos;t see what the big deal is .
i don &apos;t know everyone that you &apos;ve been with .
you &apos;re right .
we both have pasts ,
but mine &apos;s not about to be chronicled in a magazine .
there &apos;s bound to be a serena chapter soon , right ?
maybe it &apos;s time we have the conversation--
discuss everyone we &apos;ve been with to avoid
any more embarrassrag surprises in print or at parties .
everyone ?
within reason .
second base and beyond .
kissing doesn &apos;t count .
i think it &apos;s a great idea .
i just have to run an errand first .
when you get back then .
that eleanor again ?
debriefing my mother on waldorf designs can wait .
she knows i have no buyers ,
and she &apos;s just calling to yell at me .
besides , i have much more pressing business to attend to ,
like finding lady alexander ,
whoever and wherever she may be .
now i &apos;ve gone through the peerage registries
of all the royals in western europe ,
and the closest i could find was a lady alexandria of lisbon ,
but she died 50 years ago in a portuguese mental hospital .
i am starting to think my father
had his bodyguard feed us bad intel .
that is in bart &apos;s playbook ,
but i &apos;m having one of those psychic hunches i get ,
like when i predicted tom and katie wouldn &apos;t last .
you didn &apos;t have to be psychic to call that one .
i know this may be a little crazy .
my mother has a friend called lady vaughn ,
only &quot; lady &quot; isn &apos;t her title . it &apos;s her name .
she literally changed it to sound more important
so she could sit on the boards of all the big museums ,
and it worked .
maybe lady alexander did the same .
there she is .
lady alexander .
but it says she &apos;s not on the board .
it &apos;s a portrait in a private showing .
by the artist brian batt .
i know him ! i mean , i @-@ i know his work .
he has a studio downtown .
i always wanted to commission a portrait of you .
what &apos;s wrong ? the eggs overcooked again ?
no . actually , yes ,
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s so upsetting .
eric just texted me from sarah lawrence
telling me i was on &quot; gossip girl &quot; &quot;
this is about our wedding ?
no , the night before , when i slept with rufus .
that &apos;s old news .
i have no idea why i &apos;m suddenly
on the radar of this childish blog .
i think it &apos;s fairly obvious what kind of child
would be putting out such stories .
charles ?
no , he would never .
he shipped a woman in from dubai
to drive a wedge in between us .
i &apos;m sorry he keeps dragging you into our fight .
maybe that &apos;s why he hasn &apos;t returned my calls .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
okay .
i love how you
combine the classic portraiture with pop culture ,
but we really came to see your portrait of lady alexander .
friends of ours saw it in your private show at the met ,
and they suggest we mimic the style .
i wanna do the exact same pose .
i think you &apos;ve got the wrong guy .
i don &apos;t do that sort of thing .
obviously ,
we wouldn &apos;t want to compromise your artistic integrity
by recreating someone else &apos;s pose .
unless it &apos;s okay with her .
and we tripled your fee .
i don &apos;t mind calling lady alexander myself .
see , i generally don &apos;t take no for an answer .
so if you &apos;d simply provide a phone number ...
looks like chuck &apos;s midas touch is still intact .
i really hope we &apos;re not talking about the same lady alexander .
here she is .
but a horse by any other name is still a horse .
and chuck and blair can &apos;t seem to buy a clue .
assuming that lady alexander isn &apos;t related to mr. ed ,
it appears we &apos;ve hit another dead end .
not exactly .
thoroughbred registries have all the important info
on every sale , such as prices and previous owners .
it &apos;s like m.l.s. for horses .
so find the horse , find the owner .
here she is-- lady alexander .
it says she was bought four years ago
by bartholomew bass .
what else does it say ?
not much except she was just under $ 1 million .
is that a lot of money ?
for regular people , yes .
i meant for a horse .
i didn &apos;t realize your father was such a horse enthusiast .
he &apos;s not .
then ...
why did he buy a dozen thoroughbreds in a single month ?
let me see that .
it says here he bought them all from the same man in dubai .
i don &apos;t recognize the name ,
and i &apos;ve been through the bass industries books
with a fine @-@ toothed comb .
maybe your father &apos;s secret is that he &apos;s just into horses ,
really , really expensive horses .
i doubt he &apos;d pay off amira for that .
i need to find sheikh hassan .
there is a big 3 @-@ day horse show going on
just outside the city right now .
i saw it on one of the registries .
it--it attracts an elite international crowd .
maybe if the sheikh isn &apos;t there himself ,
he has people there for him ?
looks like we &apos;re back in the saddle .
you--you have a house in the hamptons , too ?
and in aspen and in st. barth &apos;s , too .
sorry . tiffany . time &apos;s up .
don &apos;t call us . we &apos;ll call you .
okay , you both know the drill .
skip the small talk and get down to business .
you have five minutes .
serena .
are you here to interview for the position ?
i &apos;m sorry . do you work here now ?
as if .
i &apos;m pimping out celebutantes for dan to have sex with .
if you &apos;re interested , you can , uh , get in line .
uh , dan told me to meet him here .
i &apos;ll just be two minutes .
that &apos;s fine ,
but i &apos;m going to have to ask you to leave your bag .
we can &apos;t risk any unauthorized recording devices .
his words are worth too much .
no , the bank has all my paperwork , okay ?
and you &apos;ve seen the numbers , and they &apos;re good .
no , i @-@ i get that there &apos;s a lot of money
going out the door each month , okay ?
but just , with a little more time ,
i know i can turn things around .
i understand . thank you .
who let you in here ?
that article this morning was unfairly biased .
it &apos;s my job to report on other people &apos;s business .
i &apos;d be a hypocrite to get upset about it .
plus , &quot; the spectato &quot; &quot; just got plugged
in a popular national magazine .
the glass is half full approach , huh ? yeah .
i know your paper is in trouble .
i also know that you are a lot smarter
than that article makes you out to be .
so i am here to offer you some relief .
let &apos;s talk .
so what &apos;s so important you had to see me in person ?
and allow georgina to frisk you ?
i @-@ i need to know , did you write a chapter about me ?
of course i did .
you really think my father or nate are more interesting
than the infamous serena van der woodsen ?
okay , but i need to know what &apos;s in it and when it comes out .
well , that would ruin all the fun .
dan , i &apos;m serious .
did you write about that night
that we were together at the campbell apartment ?
relax . i didn &apos;t publish any of that .
but not to protect you .
um , because it was the most humiliating thing
i &apos;ve ever been a part of . but don &apos;t worry .
there &apos;s--there &apos;s gonna be some good stuff in your chapter .
i think i might even include a little tidbit
of this desperate conversation .
wow , i ... i can &apos;t believe
i ever loved someone who could write
such awful things about his friends and family .
right , &apos; cause you were thinking about my feelings
when you made that sex tape .
you know the worst part is
you actually seem to be enjoying it .
serena , wait a second . wait .
on your way out , just let georgina know
that i gotta take a bathroom break .
thanks for stopping by .
uh , dan says have the next girl meet him in the bathroom .
mmm . that &apos;s more like it .
hey . i just finished my errand .
yeah , i got everything i needed .
so ... you back &quot; the spectator , &quot;
and i put out fluff pieces on you and lily
to offset her bad press on &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
i know you did well with that article on rufus ,
and mature readers help broaden your demo .
you will have the extra cash you need .
and as for me ,
a happy wife is a happy life .
next thing i know ,
you &apos;ll be asking me to write bad press on chuck , huh ?
i &apos;m not looking for another partner . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m gonna handle this one on my own .
i have no doubt you will succeed ,
especially if you &apos;ve inherited
your father &apos;s gift with numbers .
he was always so ...
inventive .
信心不再 心灰意冷
hey , it &apos;s nate .
listen , i have a business proposition for you .
拒接
well ... at least i know your phone is working .
what i don &apos;t know is why you &apos;re avoiding my calls .
it &apos;s nothing personal .
as you know , i &apos;ve been avoiding my father .
and , well , you &apos;re married to him .
does that mean
you &apos;re behind the stories about me on &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
is that what he told you ?
i hope you know
i would never do something like that to you .
well , i needed to hear it from you .
i also need for you to end this feud with your father .
i love both of you ,
and i can &apos;t stand
to be in the middle of it a second longer .
i appreciate your desire to bring us back together ,
but we were never close to begin with .
the man &apos;s idea of father / son bonding
was teaching me how to diversify bonds .
it &apos;s always been business between us .
well , i got us tickets to the horse show ,
but it starts in an hour , so ...
oh . hello , lily .
oh , well , you don &apos;t mean
the one at the stone orchard stables ?
it is . i ... i don &apos;t ...
chuck ?
oh , i haven &apos;t been in years . it &apos;s a fabulous event .
and a wonderful opportunity , charles ,
for you and your father
to talk about something other than business
and start to make amends . i &apos;m gonna see if he &apos;s available .
oh , please . no , don &apos;t tell him .
this should be a surprise .
well , that was fast .
so ... what &apos;s this big business opportunity
you mentioned on the phone ?
mind if i come in ?
looks like chuck and blair aren &apos;t the only ones
with a surprise visitor .
so much for golden boy going it alone .
so what &apos;s with all the boxes ?
are you moving in , or is rufus moving out ?
it &apos;s rufus &apos; stuff from lily &apos;s .
i know you released the story about rufus suing dan ,
so i figured you might also be behind
all the stories about lily on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
well , now i know where you got all the ammo from .
lily acts so high and mighty ,
but look at her .
she &apos;s been married a dozen times .
she &apos;s had countless affairs , a secret kid .
she &apos;s even spent time under house arrest ,
but never pays the price .
and why should rufus suffer
while lily &apos;s reputation remains unscathed ?
i agree .
you do ?
but lily &apos;s friends don &apos;t read &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
so you should put the stories out on &quot; the spectator . &quot;
i can see why you don &apos;t feel like socializing with your father ,
but why would you insist on keeping your attendance
at an equestrian event a secret ?
i could care less about the horses .
i &apos;m looking at the property .
as long as my father and i are both
in the real estate game in new york ,
there will never be peace in our family .
stone orchard is for sale ?
oh , my god . what a shame .
it &apos;s been in the same family for two centuries .
well , i heard they lost a fortune in facebook stock .
i &apos;m just exploring the possibility ,
and i don &apos;t want bart to know
until it &apos;s real .
this is fantastic , charles .
good for you !
i am so proud of you for thinking outside of the box ,
and outside of manhattan .
i know the place quite well .
i actually put my horses there
when we first moved back out east . and ...
i mean , i could show you around ?
i promise , not a word of this to your father .
ooh . well , then there was ben ,
who , contrary to some forged documents ,
i didn &apos;t sleep with when i was 15,
not until after he got out of prison .
and that was the last guy i was with before you .
you said that was a year and a half ago .
not even one random hook @-@ up between the jailbird and me ?
no . i swore off men . i just wanted to focus on myself .
oh , i know that must be hard for you to believe ,
since you spent the entire winter focusing on
the &quot; sports illustrated &quot; swimsuit models .
wait , wait . come on . you saw that cat daddy video .
so that &apos;s it , then ? we &apos;re--we &apos;re good ?
i feel prepared for anything that could be published .
okay .
no .
just ... no .
did , uh , nate get back to you about the , uh , horse show ?
he &apos;s got some work to do . he &apos;s gonna meet us there .
i &apos;m really glad he &apos;s going . go easy on him , okay ?
serena , did you want to come , too ?
i mean , if my dad wants you to .
oh . well , i @-@ i don &apos;t want to intrude .
no . no , no , come .
you can keep sage occupied while i interrogate her boyfriend .
bart , dear , i know you &apos;re going to be devastated ,
but i was thinking we should cancel our dinner
with the kranzlers this evening .
gee , that &apos;s too bad .
i was looking forward to dodging all their questions
about my disappearance .
well , don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll reschedule .
you needn &apos;t bother , lily .
what else did you have in mind instead ?
well , i was suddenly in the mood for a spa overhaul--
massage , facial , nails , the works .
are you still upset
about chuck and those stories on &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
because i &apos;m planning to stop by the empire
and have a talk with him .
oh , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s necessary .
i spoke to charles , and he said he didn &apos;t leak those stories ,
and i believe him .
so i &apos;ll call you when i &apos;m done , okay ?
sure .
thank you for keeping this between us .
i hate lying ,
but there &apos;s no reason to concern your father
if it helps you with your plan to make peace .
trust me . if he found out , he &apos;d ruin everything .
sometimes it &apos;s best not to call
in order to avoid being called out later .
just smell the air-- so crisp and clean .
and fertilized .
you know , there is so much to show you .
this could take all afternoon .
oh ! uh , uh , did you see that woman over there waving at you ?
which one ?
the one that looks like princess anne .
she &apos;s saying your name and waving .
are you sure ?
ah . well , maybe i should go say hello . i don &apos;t want to be rude .
excuse me .
okay , now it &apos;s your chance ! go ! run !
blair , this isn &apos;t a hostage situation .
i don &apos;t even know who to-- excuse me .
can you tell me if any of sheikh hassan &apos;s horses
are competing today ?
mm ... just one--crown jewel . she &apos;s on the course .
thank you .
i &apos;ll go and see what i can find out about sheikh hassan .
if you can keep lily occupied for a few--
i got a closer look , and it is princess anne
with her daughter zara ,
but are you sure she was waving at me ?
because we &apos;ve never actually met before .
maybe she was just swatting away mosquitoes
or airing out her pits .
well , either way , where should we begin our tour ?
hey , guys , sorry i &apos;m late . i ...
no , it &apos;s okay . we just got here ourselves .
nate , this is my dad . you remember his fist , right ?
yeah , sorry about that .
i &apos;ve never actually punched anyone before .
you definitely did a good job . it hurt , so ...
hey , do you wanna go check out the horse ?
yeah . you guys stay and bond over how great i am
and how you want me to be happy , okay ?
great . bye !
you know , just so you know , i had to ... ice my hand all night .
probably hurt me more than it you .
and i should probably tell you
i am a huge fan of the business you &apos;ve built .
i &apos;ve been following your career for forever now . so ...
you &apos;re not dating my daughter just to get to me , are you ?
no , sir . it &apos;s just a purely added bonus .
you may be dating my daughter , but i &apos;m dating your ex .
that cancels out the need for any &quot; sirs . &quot;
lily , hi !
hi !
it &apos;s so nice to see you back at the barn .
thank you , jessica . great to see you as well .
enjoy the rest of your day .
ah ! thank you .
if you ladies wanna get a drink ,
i think i &apos;ll check out the stables .
now leaving the course-- crown jewel ,
owned by sheikh hassan ,
ridden by the sheikh &apos;s daughter iman .
oh , i think the stables are this way .
actually , lily ... can we take a little detour ?
you know , i &apos;ve been considering an equestrian for my next line ,
and i want you to introduce me
to those women in the fabulous fascinators .
next on the course ...
that is a beautiful horse .
i &apos;d love to talk to you about buying it .
so who &apos;s it gonna be ?
personally , i think melissa has the better face for photos ,
but natasha is a coppola ,
and that does come with a certain cachet .
well , i have to choose now ?
obviously .
but can &apos;t it wait ? i mean , i &apos;m--i &apos;m--i &apos;m exhausted .
oh , suck it up , humphrey . they have pills for that .
these girls are perfect .
they all come from great neighborhoods ,
have very high i.q.s , and dress in design lables .
they meet all of our requirements .
this just isn &apos;t me .
these girls might be perfect on paper ,
but they &apos;re not who i &apos;m looking for .
who you &apos;re ...
since when are you looking for anybody ?
don &apos;t go soft on me now , humphrey .
finding true love was never part of our deal .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re not selling .
she &apos;s absolutely stunning .
thank you .
my family takes great pride in our thoroughbreds .
i know . i &apos;ve been a big fan of your family &apos;s horses
since i was a child .
there was one in particular i remember seeing compete .
i think she was yours . lady alexander ?
lady alexander was my childhood horse .
she was much loved but never competed a day in her life .
my father must &apos;ve loved her as much as then ,
because he paid a great deal for her .
again , you &apos;re mistaken .
she was sold to a family friend several years ago
and put to pasture .
she was worthless to anyone but me .
which made her priceless .
uncle bart ! so good to see you .
i see my son is attempting to work his charms on you .
why didn &apos;t you tell me bart bass is your father ?
he &apos;s like family .
our fathers were such good friends before his accident .
speaking of which ,
i was sorry to hear of his recent passing .
is that ...
i think that &apos;s serena .
you know her ?
uh , yeah . that &apos;s my mom .
come on . i &apos;ll introduce you .
grandma .
oh , no , no . don &apos;t call her that .
yeah , as much as i &apos;d love to stay
and chat with your charming daughter ,
i have to take this call from my mother .
oh , tell eleanor i said hello .
serena , darling , i had no idea you were coming to this .
oh , yeah . it was just a last @-@ minute decision .
but i want you to meet steven &apos;s daughter sage .
hi . it &apos;s nice to meet you .
oh , likewise .
um , you &apos;re so much ...
more mature than i &apos;d imagined .
i should probably go check on my dad and nate .
okay , i &apos;ll be right there .
how old is she ?
oh , you know what ?
this is probably my fault that you have a father complex .
wait , so you really played basketball at duke ?
you &apos;re really that gullible ?
no . no , unlike the other chemical engi @-@ nerds ,
i did watch a few games .
hey , some people call it gullible . i like to call it trusting .
it seems like you guys are getting along .
no black eyes at least .
no , you were--you were right about this guy .
he &apos;s trusting , which may have led
to some poor business decisions but ...
it makes for good character .
he reminds me a little of myself at his age .
hey , that means a lot , man . thanks .
okay , i wanted you guys to get along .
there &apos;s no need for a full @-@ on bromance .
where &apos;s serena ?
she ran into her mom .
wait . lily &apos;s here ?
do you know if he still wants to have kids ?
i mean , maybe he &apos;s done .
mother !
can we have this conversation somewhere else ?
people are starting to stare .
oh . it &apos;s probably another one
of those &quot; gossip girl &quot; stories about me .
oh , i hope it ends soon .
oh , no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s not a &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast .
it &apos;s a &quot; spectator &quot; blast ... about both of us .
&quot; like mother , like daughter .
they not only share the same taste in clothing
but also in men .
looks like steven spence put age before beauty
by sleeping with lily before serena &quot; ?
excuse me .
hey , serena , wait .
did you just omit someone from our conversation ?
like , i don &apos;t know , my mother ?
what--what are you talking about ?
your love life is the one being published on &quot; the spectator . &quot;
i had no idea that the story was about him , okay ?
i @-@ i gave it to my editor so i could be here with sage ...
and get to know steven .
well , thanks to you , we all know him better now .
way to go , nate .
dad , seriously ? gross .
yeah , i @-@ i have no idea why there &apos;s a story
about me sleeping with your mother .
it &apos;s not true !
actually , it is .
there are two sides to every story ,
with the truth and serena stuck smack in the middle .
i think you &apos;re confusing me with someone else .
unfortunately , i &apos;m not .
okay , well , one of you is wrong ,
and i really hope it &apos;s you , mom .
i know we &apos;ve met a few times socially ,
you know , through the central park conservancy .
and the bancroft wedding ?
the one in the irish castle .
we snuck down to the dungeon ,
opened the oldest bottle of whiskey we could find .
my last name was mueller then . klaus &apos; ex ?
lily mueller .
oh , my god .
oh ! so it is true .
look , it ...
it was--it--it was right after my divorce .
you know , i had gone skiing in verbier
and hurt my knee .
there were--there were painkillers and--and whiskey
and ... oh , wow .
is that why you were so cold to me
at conservancy events ?
i didn &apos;t know about the painkillers .
yeah .
but you did know that we were dating .
why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
what was i supposed to say ?
i @-@ i--you--you told me that you two were madly in love
and that he could be the one .
besides ...
i figured steven should be the one to tell you .
well , i guess this was one of those surprises
we were hoping to avoid .
in five minutes .
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing here ,
talking to iman ?
enjoying the horses . same as you , right ?
because lily would hate to learn
that you had me followed .
you need to stop sticking your nose in where it doesn &apos;t belong
and leave lily out of this .
do we understand each other ?
i didn &apos;t realize you &apos;d become such an animal lover .
i have a dog , too .
i find the company of animals preferable to some people .
another weakness you didn &apos;t inherit from me .
i pulled the story off the site , okay ?
i got a hold of some old list lily made .
you know , the names of everyone that she had ever slept with .
i @-@ i swear i didn &apos;t know your dad &apos;s name was on it .
everything was going so well .
my dad was really starting to like you .
i screwed up . i &apos;m sorry .
i should &apos;ve vetted the article before it ever came out .
what do you have against serena &apos;s mom anyway ?
nothing . i don &apos;t have anything against her .
i just ...
it was a--it was a-- it was a desperate move
to save my company .
it was a mistake .
well , you decided to do it on your own for a reason .
i did , and i think i know of a way that i can
without hurting anyone that i care about .
hey . i &apos;m sorry .
okay ? i &apos;m really sorry .
and i just ...
i don &apos;t want to lose &quot; the spectator . &quot;
or you .
i just saw lily leaving with bart.
did you not tell him you tracked down the sheikh ?
doesn &apos;t matter . sheikh &apos;s dead ,
and the daughter won &apos;t talk .
she won &apos;t ? why not ?
she calls him &quot; uncle bart. &quot;
we &apos;re done here . shall we ?
uh , i &apos;ll meet you at the car .
i need the ladies &apos; room after all those mint juleps .
right .
next on the course ...
owned by the kelly stables .
iman ? hi .
i &apos;m blair . i &apos;m a close friend of chuck &apos;s .
i know he left before he could speak to you ,
but this is important to him , and so it &apos;s important to me .
is this about the horse ?
because i know chuck never really wanted it .
he was just flirting with me .
i don &apos;t think he was flirting with you .
look , i know how much these horses mean to you
and meant to your father .
unfortunately , they don &apos;t mean that much to bart.
he isn &apos;t exactly a big donator at p.e.t.a ,
if you know what i mean .
i &apos;m not sure i do .
well , bart bass . killed a tiger on safari ?
he eats veal on a regular basis ?
i don &apos;t know about any of that ,
but he was a good friend to my father .
he bought lady alexander and the others ,
so they could live out their days
on a farm in virginia .
okay .
listen , princess jasmine ,
the fact is , your uncle bart is bad .
i &apos;m sure every single horse he bought from your family
went straight to the glue factory ,
including your beloved lady alexander .
but , if you like , go ahead . check it out .
see if you find
the bart bass retirement home for aged equines .
trust me , chuck is the good guy here ,
and he needs your help .
on the upper east side , it &apos;s hard to know who to trust .
usually , the answer is no one .
i &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s gonna take me more than a car ride
to forget the fact that you slept with my mother .
serena , i can &apos;t change what happened .
i can forget it , obviously , but i @-@ i can &apos;t change it .
maybe you can forget , too ?
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll ever be able to forget this .
well , i ...
i guess i can try to move past it .
i mean , crazier things have happened in my family .
wait , wait , wait . please , just not so fast .
there are certain images that keep popping up .
then we must try to erase them .
i &apos;m warning you . this could take a while .
i never thought i &apos;d see you again .
care for a drink ?
i can &apos;t stay long ,
but i wanted to tell you
that i looked into what your friend blair told me .
lady alexander never went to any farm in virginia .
blair told you she did ?
no . bart told me .
but the horses he purchased from my family
are nowhere to be found .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
bart obviously didn &apos;t care much about your horses
and probably paid your father a lot of money
for something else .
do you know what it was ?
maybe a @-@ a real estate deal ? perhaps a hotel ?
a hotel ?
no , my father was in the oil business .
but bart couldn &apos;t have been involved in that .
why not the oil business ?
because we have a home in dubai ,
but we &apos;re sudanese nationals .
i &apos;m sorry . international affairs are not my area of expertise .
well , at least not this kind .
well , the u.s. has an embargo against trading oil with sudan ,
so if that &apos;s what he bought from my father--
bart was breaking federal law .
thanks for taking another look at my loan application .
i ... can &apos;t believe i left out all the revenue from the new markets .
just a rookie mistake , i guess .
well , the numbers do look better ,
and , uh , i &apos;m glad you caught the error ,
because , uh , with ad sales projections like this ...
we &apos;re happy to extend &quot; the spectator &apos;s &quot; line of credit .
thank you so much . you &apos;re a lifesaver .
now let me just go make you a copy of this real quick .
i &apos;ll be right back .
how did it go ?
yeah , nate asked me to take another look at the numbers
like you said he would .
are you sure you wanna co @-@ sign on this loan ?
it &apos;s obvious he &apos;s doctored his earnings report .
the apple doesn &apos;t fall far from the tree .
send me the documents to sign in the morning .
again , i &apos;m sorry
i didn &apos;t tell you i was with charles ,
and you felt the need to follow us .
apparently ...
with good reason .
he &apos;s just trying to make things right with you .
i know how much you wanna believe that ,
but charles has done nothing since we &apos;ve gotten back together
but lie and manipulate you .
oh , really ? you really think i &apos;m that much of a pushover .
he will prey upon your maternal instincts
to get between us .
well , i won &apos;t let that happen .
neither will i.
you know how much i don &apos;t like ultimatums ,
but i &apos;m afraid chuck has left me no choice .
if you wanna be with me ,
you need to stay away from my son .
you can &apos;t ask me to do that .
he &apos;s my son , too .
we &apos;re not done discussing this .
so bart was using the horses
to hide the money he was buying illegal oil with ?
he had to hide it somehow .
sudan is an embargoed country ,
which means he didn &apos;t fake his death
because he was worried mason nevins
would come after lily or me .
he did it so he could avoid federal prison .
well , this is what we need .
right ? quick .
call the cia or the fbi or tmz .
let &apos;s turn him in !
i wish it were that simple . we need evidence first .
i was already planning our victory celebration in my head .
we were in a bubble bath with a bottle of grande cuvee
and no business in the way of us being together .
hold onto that visual .
if i must .
call me if you need anything .
blair , it &apos;s jean pierre .
your mother is not pleased .
she knows you &apos;re avoiding her calls
and that you don &apos;t have orders from any buyers .
she says you have one month to fix this .
lily , i cannot apologize to you enough .
i mean , nothing like this will ever happen again in &quot; the spectator , &quot;
i promise you .
thank you for understanding , yeah . bye .
i hope you &apos;re here because you forgive me , too .
i hope that answers your question .
if serena can forgive my dad for sleeping with lily ,
and lily can forgive you for publishing a story about it ,
i guess i can forgive you for acting like a jerk .
you know , i @-@ i haven &apos;t gone through those .
are you sure you just wanna throw it all away ?
some of it must have sentimental value .
yeah , i &apos;m sure ,
and i &apos;m sorry i put the responsibility on you to begin with ,
but i was at the gallery ,
and i realized i don &apos;t want this stuff .
i @-@ i don &apos;t wanna look back .
i just wanna look forward ...
with you .
we all have things from our past we &apos;d like to erase .
philip , get some popcorn .
i ran into serena earlier today and picked up a movie for us .
but on the upper east side ,
it &apos;s not so easy to hit &quot; delete . &quot;
there &apos;s always a record of misdeed somewhere ...
and someone &apos;s always looking for it .
humphrey , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m pretty sure you have a spare room up in here .
i was wondering if i could crash .
you made it pretty clear you were done with me .
what &apos;s changed ?
i realized i made a mistake .
i &apos;ve missed you .
i &apos;ve missed ... my friend .
last year , when you had no one , i was there for you .
i kinda need you to do the same for me right now .
serena &apos;s bed is empty .
make yourself at home .
better not to ignore the past but learn from it instead .
otherwise , history has a way of repeating itself .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
