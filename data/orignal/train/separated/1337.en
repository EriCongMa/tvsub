Where'd you go?
That did not come out the way I intended to.
All right, please just come talk to me.
We -- we can work this out.
Um, I've got a proposal
that's gonna work for both of us.
Hey. Wait. What are you doing?
Okay, why won't you just let me call for help?
Because you will call 911,
and they will send a fire engine and a surgical team
for a sprained ankle.
Just -- just help me up. - Okay. Come on.
Okay. Okay.
Thank you.
Okay, that's better.
Give me your keys
and let me drive you to the hospital.
No. Maura, I'm fine.
"Fine" is an adverb. It means "pleasing or very well."
So, you're very well?
Yes. Ow!
Stop it.
I just want to examine it.
Do not touch my ankle.
You let me look at it or I speed-dial 911.
I hate you.
No, you don't hate me. You just hate feeling vulnerable.
Okay. Does this hurt?
Yes! Ow.
Okay. What about this?
Please stop touching it!
I suspect you have a partial tear
in your anterior talofibular ligament.
Otherwise known as a sprained ankle.
You have to go see a doctor.
I just did. Bill my insurance.
Okay. Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.
Don't say anything.
Rafael's even sexier half-naked.
Morning.
Hey, detective. Doctor.
Morning.
You just do the loop?
Yeah.
You tired or something?
No, just a little dehydrated.
Nice car.
It's a standard-issue BPD sedan.
How many miles on it?
I don't know. Like, 60,000. Why?
Just curious. Okay, see you.
Meet you inside.
See you.
Oh, what did you do?
I sprained my ankle.
You know the only way to get her to a hospital
is to knock her out, right?
Yeah, don't tempt me.
Just -- can you please just help me inside?
All right.
No, don't you dare.
Until you agree to let me x-ray it.
It's not broken.
Knock her out.
Wait! No! Okay, okay. Okay.
Come on. Let's go, okay?
Got it?
I don't got it. Hopping, hopping.
Hopping! Hopping! Hopping!
There it is.
No break in the fibula or tibia.
So, I'm fine.
Oh, look!
Senior criminalist Chang
went to the store and bought you a new shoe.
Size 9, right?
No. No way.
Yes. Yes way.
Susie, can you please hold down detective Rizzoli
so we can put the protective boot on her?
O-okay.
Give me that. I'll do it myself.
No, it hurts. It hurts. It hurts.
All right. Distract yourself.
Okay. Um...
Do you think that the army reads
all the e-mails that I send Casey?
Well, of course.
The Defense Aadvanced Research Projects Agency
has algorithms that analyze everything.
Well, that's just wrong.
Why? What kind of e-mails are you writing?
Mushy stuff.
Well, I think the government
is looking for traitors and terrorists,
not to make fun of you and your mushy e-mails to your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.
He's my...
...long-distance lover.
Oh. 6,500 miles.
That's -- that's a lot of distance.
Yes, Maura, and?
Well, I just find it interesting
that your relationship with Casey
heated up the second he got on a plane to Afghanistan.
W-well?
Okay.
Yes. Fine. I mean, I-I miss him.
Now.
Well, he just -- he got all domestic,
and -- and it just made me claustrophobic.
Don't you wish you could press a button
and have men appear when you wanted them?
Yes.
Well, maybe you can amuse yourself with Rafael.
If you don't, maybe I will.
Martinez? No.
And he wasn't looking at either one of us.
He was... looking at my car.
Do you think he's gonna take my car for the Drug Unit?
Well, he can't just take your car, Jane.
He can. He's a lieutenant.
And I heard the drug unit was short on cars.
Well, hold on.
Don't react to something that hasn't happened.
You're right. Okay. All right.
Okay, how are you gonna get upstairs?
Well, does senior criminalist Chang have crutches?
I'm telling you, it's probably torn.
Can you please just give me some crutches?!
Oh, ohh, god.
No, I'm gonna wait here. I was --
Ohh! Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy!
You broke more bones than your brothers combined.
How do you do this to yourself?
It's not broken.
Bunny pancakes? Thanks, Angela.
Uh-oh. What did you do?
What? I thought it looked cool.
Maura said a big boot is the new black.
Well, I think she tore a ligament.
Stop saying that.
How did you do it?
Wrestling bulls.
No, I was chasing a bad guy.
I tripped while jogging.
I'll tell anybody who asks you were sword fighting.
Hey, Vinnie.
Hola, guapo.
Buenos dias, preciosa .
Buenos dias,lieutenant.
I'll have my usual.
Why is he so nice to my mother?
Because he's not interested in sleeping with her.
What? Maura.
No, that's it.
That is why he ignores you --
because he's attracted to you.
What? No.
Mm. Yes.
No, no, no, no. Mm-hmm.
No.
What did you do? Kick somebody.
Yeah.
Is it serious?
No.
Yes.
Yes, it could be a torn ligament,
which is more serious than a broken bone.
Oh, then I hate to do this to you today,
but I need your keys.
My keys? Because you're taking my car?
Why would you take her car?
Look at her. She needs it.
Come on, Rafe.
You got to share, Vinnie.
Chief of detectives assigned some of your cars to me.
I'm sorry.
Hey, honey. Here. Take mine.
Thanks, ma, but detectives aren't allowed
to use personal cars for work.
We have a fatal hit-and-run.
My least favorite call.
It's usually some jackass running a light.
Come on, Jane. Me and dr. Isles can do a fireman's carry.
We can even stop by Boston Joe's.
Will that make you feel better?
Yes.
I'll need a quadruple latte with an ibuprofen fo
to make this day go better.
Oh, yeah, Maura.
He took my car because he likes me.
He really, really likes me.
Hey. You should get going.
That hit-and-run might be a homicide.
Hold on. He'll still be dead when we get there.
Wet cap for Barry.
That's me.
Careful.
It's hot.
Got it. Thanks.
Speaking of hot. Hmm.
Too hot.
I think that's the little barista
that called your partner a bitch.
Well, she is the one, all right.
Oh, where is Jane?
She's waiting in the car. I'm worried about her ankle.
I'm also worried about Detective Frost
flirting with the barista that was rude to his partner.
I'm just looking.
Large house for Vince.
Oh, I got it.
Extra-hot flat latte, no foam, for...Maura.
Free coffee on me.
I'd love to see you in here again.
See you at the scene.
Bye.
Oh, boy, are you in trouble now.
Thank you.
Where's Jane?
I took her back to headquarters. She couldn't walk.
Maybe she should go to a hospital.
Wait. How did she get upstairs?
Frankie and two uniforms carried her.
I thought they'd have to handcuff her.
Jane's calling me from her desk phone. What should we do?
Answer it before she tries to come down here.
Hey, Jane.
Okay, put me on the tablet so I can see the crime scene.
Yeah, tell her only if her foot is elevated.
You hear that?
Yeah, it's up. It's up. Show me.
Who's that?
David Sutton. 35.
He taught science and driver's ed at the high school.
That's a cruel irony.
Driver's ed teacher dies in a hit-and-run.
Groundskeeper found him in the bushes
just as school was starting.
What do you think? Accident or homicide?
Not sure. Frost, follow me.
I think the point of impact was right about here.
Take a photo.
Okay, this is interesting.
What? What is it?
It's a headlight-bulb fragment.
Filament's still there.
So, the driver's headlights were off.
How can you tell?
Tungsten filament is brittle when it's cold,
but it'll stretch
if the headlights are on at the time of the collision.
If they're off, it'll break. That one's busted.
Come on.
Intermittent skid marks.
I'm seeing acceleration marks, too.
I never did accident reconstruction.
So, someone slammed on the brakes.
You mean, before they hit him?
Yeah.
Then, with their headlights off,
they gunned it and ran into the victim.
So, does that mean --
Yeah. Means this probably wasn't an accident.
You got it?
Yeah.
How long has he been dead?
The body is just in the first stage of rigor.
8 to 10 hours.
So, this happened last night?
Uh-huh. He was carrying a key.
Take it to the crime lab.
That's a strange key.
Looks like a modern version of a skeleton key.
Maybe it's to his office.
Frost, let's go interview the principal.
We can bag him now.
Okay.
I'm a reporter with WZJT.
Care to comment about your dead teacher, Mr. Sutton?
Excuse me.
The reporter's just doing his job,
but I told him to leave you alone.
Thank you.
Did you know Mr. Sutton?
We all had him for driver's ed.
I also had him for A.P. Chem.
I had him for A.P. Bio.
And I was the idiot that had him for both.
He was so fun.
We would always try cool experiments.
Do you have any advice?
Any advice?
On how we deal with this?
I think your grief counselors can help with that,
and lean on each other.
Okay. Thank you.
You know what this key is for?
We found it in his pocket.
No. Never seen it before.
All the keys here look like this.
Were there any students
who might have had a problem with Mr. Sutton?
What, you th-- you think this wasn't an accident?
Any kid with a grudge? Somebody he might have flunked?
Well, sure. Kids and parents
complain all the time about all my teachers.
Mr. Sutton was strict. His curriculum was hard.
You'll find a number of complaints in his files.
We'll need that,
his classroom files, and his computer.
Probably at his house.
I just spoke with his wife, poor thing.
They just had their third baby.
We'll head over and talk to her. Thank you.
We are very sorry for your loss.
I told him not to jog at night.
Why didn't he listen?
How often did he go running?
A lot.
Mrs. Sutton, where were you last night?
Asleep. Why?
Why didn't you call the police
when your husband failed to come back from his jog?
The baby keeps him up. He sleeps in the den.
Do you think this was deliberate?
Is that why you're asking me that?
I have three kids under the age of 4.
I'm not gonna kill their father.
Did he have trouble with any of his students or their parents?
No. He was very dedicated.
He was teacher of the year more than once.
He even taught driver's ed for free
because the school district didn't have the funding.
Is this key to your house?
No. I don't know what that's for.
Is that your husband's computer?
Yes.
Mommy's coming.
My kids are crying.
We'll need to take his computer.
All right. Take whatever you need.
It doesn't look like he did much jogging.
Well, he didn't.
His gluteal aponeurosis and maxi-muscle
have very poor definition.
Oh, let's not talk about his butt.
There's a gash in his sartorius.
You mean his thigh?
No, I mean his sartorius.
It's a muscle in the thigh.
Can you see all this bruising and this gash?
It's probably from the front of the grille that hit him.
Maura, we got to find this hit-and-run car.
Is there anything in the wound?
Hmm. Let me take a look.
Hmm. I see particulates. Blue and gray.
I'll get them analyzed.
I don't know what I'm gonna miss more --
walking or driving my own car.
Well, you shouldn't be doing either.
You should be home, icing your foot.
I just never realized how important my car was to me, you know?
I hope this isn't personal.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, I-it could be a form of grown-up teasing.
You know, Rafael likes you,
but he's frustrated because you're not interested.
What?! Don't be ridiculous.
Well, he took Frost's car, too.
I don't think he's attracted to him.
I know detectives who have quit when they took their cars.
And -- and -- and I get it, you know?
We spend our entire lives with dead people
and that's how they thank us?
No disrespect.
He says, "None taken."
What? What's that?
He says, "You're a great detective.
Find out who did this to me."
Yeah, Don Corleone has nothing on you.
Just when I thought I was out,
you pull me back in!
Hi! Mm. I got it. I got it.
If it were me, I'd come down with the blue flu
till I got my car back.
No, you wouldn't.
Especially if you were looking for someone
who mowed down a teacher.
I mean, it's almost like killing a cop.
So, all you've got is part of a light bulb and skid marks.
Yeah.
You're gonna need Encyclopedia Brown for this one.
That's funny!
Is it really awful there?
Yeah. It's dusty and hot, but I'm okay.
They call Bagram Airfield
"Camp Cupcake" for a reason.
Good desserts?
Job's okay. Look at this. My own man can.
Oh, a man can.
Yeah. Gosh. It's positively palatial.
Okay, so, come on. What -- what can I send you?
Cookies? You want movies, tv show?
How about you just send me you?
Well, I don't like long plane rides, so...
Maybe we can meet in the middle.
What's in between Boston and Afghanistan?
The Atlantic Ocean.
Yeah, that.
Oh, I wish I could touch you.
Um, speaking of privacy, um, I'm in the break room,
and someone just came in to get some coffee, so --
Frost or Korsak?
It's Martinez.
I'm gonna say goodbye.
Talk to you soon, baby.
Okay.
So, that's the famous Casey, huh?
Yeah.
I hear he's in Afghanistan.
Yeah, he's, uh, working with soldiers who have PTSD.
You miss him?
Yeah. I do.
Look, I'm sorry about taking your car.
You know it isn't personal, right?
Okay.
Put it back.
Oh, my god. It's like having four mothers.
Okay. Here's something.
Been going through all of Mr. Sutton's e-mail.
Look at this.
Who's that?
One of his A.P. Chem students. Samantha Cole.
"Give me an 'A' -- and I'll give you some of this"?
What? How old is she?
Just turned sweet 16.
Well, it looks like sweet, little Samantha Cole
wanted to get her grade changed.
She's offering a trade.
You think he said no so she ran him over?
Maybe. Let's find her and ask.
I'll call the attendance office.
And we need to know every car that Samantha Cole had access to.
Speaking of cars, I'll probably need one
if I'm gonna talk to her.
Hello, this is Detective Frost, Boston Police.
I need to know the whereabouts of a student --
Samantha Cole.
Okay.
Thank you.
What is it?
I just found Samantha.
Maybe Maura should drive you there.
Why Maura?
Because of where you're going.
She's been in a coma for 10 days.
Well, at least we know she didn't run over Mr. Sutton.
What happened?
She overdosed.
On what?
Her mother's codeine prescription.
How bad is it?
Bad.
This may be the way she spends the rest of her life.
You know, if I thought
my kid did this to herself because of some teacher,
I might run him over.
By the time I got home from work,
she had already been in cardiac arrest
for about 15 minutes.
Do you know why she attempted suicide?
We put too much pressure on her.
This was our fault.
Suicide in teenagers is -- it's much more complicated.
No. He's right. We did.
I couldn't stop riding her.
One "D," and Harvard was, "off the table, Sam."
And why? Why did I do that?
What did she tell you about Mr. Sutton?
She loved that teacher.
She took every science class he taught.
You've seen it?
Yeah. We found it on her phone.
We were looking through her things.
Just trying to understand why she did this.
We heard about his death this morning.
I'm just so glad that we made ourselves apologize to that man.
You apologized?
For Sam.
I just --
I just wish that we could tell her
that it doesn't matter.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, the charge nurse on Samantha's floor said
that her parents were with her all night.
And the headlight debris we found
is molded, polycarbonate plastic.
Like every other late-model headlight.
That's not gonna help us find the car. What else?
Mm, the blue particulates in the victim's leg
are cheap automotive paint,
and there was also navy-blue paint
used exclusively on Chevy Impalas.
Oh, excellent. OKay, so Frost can start a DMV search.
Yeah, and tell him he's looking
for a car that's been in an accident.
Wait, you mean another accident?
Yeah, the blue particulates are paint,
so the gray stuff will be Bondo.
It is. You're good.
Tell my chief of detectives that,
and maybe he'll give me my car back.
I think those guys are rating the girls in here.
Here. Come on. Let's give them a cheap thrill.
Can I borrow your pen?
Be nice.
All right.
Ready?
They like it.
They do. Look at them.
What would you give me?
Hey, Martinez.
Oh, I would give you an 8.75.
Come on. Give him a 10. It's late.
I came by to tell you you can use this car for police business.
Why do you have my mother's keys.
And, no, I can't, because regulations won't allow it.
Section 14 of the Massachusetts State Law
allows the use of an impounded car, so, yes.
You impounded my mother's car?
She told me to.
Besides, we're both worried about you.
Oh. Well, thank you.
Sure.
I'd tike to buy you a drink,
but I think you should take your ankle home
and get some rest.
Uh, I was just leaving.
Rain check okay?
Okay.
Doctor.
That, my friend, is chemistry.
That can never happen again.
Where's Jane?
You think she got smart and decided to stay in bed?
Are you kidding me?
If I know hop-a-long, she'll be taking the stairs.
Yep, that's her.
She's picking up her mother, then she'll be here.
How's the search for the hit-and-run car coming?
Not good. There are a lot of blue Impalas.
I was about to go through the rest of these.
I found a lot of parents who complained about Mr. Sutton.
Here's a sample.
"He ignores male students and caters to the girls,
even though the boys are better at science."
Tell that to the two smartest scientists I know --
my mom and Dr. Isles.
Yeah.
I'll pull up all of Sutton's class rosters,
cross-reference those with blue Impalas.
Good idea.
Wait. This might be something.
What is it?
Two years ago, he had to expel one of his best students
'cause he found weed in her lab cubby.
Got a name?
Karine Alberts.
She was on target to be class valedictorian.
She's still local.
Maybe she blames Sutton.
Hey, mind if I take a meeting downstairs?
A meeting?
I'll make it quick.
Yeah, yeah. Go on.
I'll let Jane know we're gonna grab
our failed valedictorian and bring her in.
So cool of you to meet me at work.
So cool that you're a cop.
I'm actually a detective in homicide.
Wow. Even cooler.
Is it okay to ask what you're working on?
A high-school teacher that died in a hit-and-run.
Oh, yeah. I heard about that.
I probably shouldn't say too much more.
I understand.
So, how long you been at Boston Joe's?
Two years.
Not as impressive as you, but I'm the manager.
I'm putting myself through school.
Wow. Good for you. What are you studying?
Actually I'm -- - Would you like me to, uh, heat your coffee?
No, thanks.
Yeah, I would. Thanks.
I couldn't help but overhear you're a student.
Yeah, I am. Graduate student, actually.
Wow. Wonderful.
Mrs. Rizzoli, this is Neda.
Lovely to meet you.
Thanks for the refill.
What are you studying?
Business administration.
Nice.
What kind of business are you interested in?
Well, actually -- - Uh, Mrs.Rizzoli, you know what?
I changed my mind.
I think I've had enough caffeine, so...
Hey, Frost. Your quick meeting almost over?
Yeah.
Good, 'cause Jane is upstairs doing your DMV search,
and we've got a suspect to interrogate.
Probably should get back to work.
Let me walk you out.
You didn't like mr. Sutton very much, did you, Karine?
He's the reason I wanted to be a marine biologist.
And what soured you on him?
Was it when he found your weed?
My weed? No.
It was when he went from being a mentor to a lascivious creep.
"Lascivious." Good word.
Thanks. Learned it at my J.C.
Where were you Monday night?
Working the graveyard shift at a 7-eleven.
You seem a little bitter.
He wrecked my life because I wouldn't...perform.
Perform?
He wanted me to give him oral sex.
Did he rape you, Karine?
No, but he said if I didn't perform,
he'd give me a "C,"
and he wouldn't write a letter of recommendation to college.
And what did you do?
I told him I was gonna talk to the principal,
so he planted weed in my stuff,
and then found it before I could talk to mr. Appleton.
Did you ever tell anyone?
It was his word against mine.
I was the druggie
and mr. Sutton was the champion of smart, nerdy girls.
I'm surprised I didn't kill myself.
Aww. What a nice little brother.
Shut up.
We get each other things when we're sick or hurt.
Hey, I saw you outside with a woman.
She's hot, man.
Is it serious?
Ah, I just met her.
So, how much time do you need?
Oh, okay. This looks promising.
What?
It's a good contender for the hit-and-run.
A 2007 navy blue Chevy Impala
registered to Edes High School.
Crap.
I don't have a car.
Oh. I got a cruiser I can borrow.
Come on. I'll take you.
All right. Thanks.
I'll be damned. The driver's ed car.
Can you see anything?
The hood's dented.
But a lot of bad drivers have had a crack at this poor car.
Keys are in the ignition.
There's a blue thread caught in the shifter.
Hmm. Bag it.
You think? Gee.
Good thing you're here.
Okay.
I'm gonna release the emergency brake and roll it.
Ready?
Seeing anything?
Yeah. Bumper's dinged, and I think this is blood.
So, maybe we're looking for some kid
who was fooling around in the driver's ed car.
And ran over his teacher.
CSRU started processing the car.
They've already counted 170 separate prints.
We'll never be able to tie that car to one driver.
How many students learned to drive in it?
A lot. It's 6 years old.
Jane's ankle is very swollen.
I made her lie down in my office.
My sister, the slacker.
Don't tell her I told you that.
Told us what?
The turquoise string that you found in the shifter
is embroidery thread.
It's commonly used to make friendship bracelets.
Friendship bracelets?
So, whoever was driving was probably a teenager.
How do we track that thread?
There's a range of theories
as to where friendship bracelets originated.
I think the use of macrame supports Arabia,
although the tribal element suggests
central and south America.
What else do you have for us, Dr. Isles?
Oh. Right.
Something did come up in the victim's tox screen --
viagra.
Who takes viagra before a jog?
And his wife just had a c-section.
Can't imagine why he'd need a greater blood flow to his penis.
I am sure you're right. Didn't take it for the wife.
And the crime lab traced the key that we found in his pocket.
It's from a high-security padlock.
Our hero teacher suddenly feels a lot less heroic.
So, he pops a viagra,
tells his wife he's going jogging,
and then heads to a high school in the middle of the night?
I don't think he was going there
to tutor budding female science students.
What's this padlock key to?
We got to tell Jane,
but she'll want to go to the high school herself.
Well, maybe Dr. Isles can go with her.
You're the only one she listens to.
She doesn't listen to me.
Yeah, well, if she passes out from the pain,
at least you'll know exactly what to do.
I drive fast because I have to walk slow.
Well, you shouldn't be driving at all,
and you routinely drive
at least 12 miles over the speed limit.
I'm doing three miles an hour, Maura.
Well, I don't mean now.
I thought you liked driving the can'o espress'o.
Well, people do smile at us.
They get out of the way, too.
This thing is better than a blue light and a siren.
Hey, look.
There's a high-security padlock on that shed.
So...Mr. Sutton had his own private space.
What did he use his driver's ed shed for?
Well, all of his class supplies.
Drive's ed manuals, DVDs, handouts.
Maura.
What?
Turquoise embroidery thread. Our driver was in here.
Did you bring a black light?
Yep.
There you go.
Thanks.
I'm seeing a lot of bodily fluids.
I think Karine was telling the truth.
He was trading grades for sex.
Looks like not all of his students said no.
Mr. Sutton's driver's ed rules.
All students will leave their phone
in the basket during class.
Samantha Cole was also one of his driver's ed students.
He took all their phones.
Yeah.
So, maybe when samantha wouldn't perform,
he gave her a "D."
And then when she threatened
to go to the principal like Karine,
He sent a photo from her phone to his phone
with a suggestive e-mail.
Where's Jane?
In the caffee?
Told her not to move
until she iced her ankle for 12 minutes.
See? I told you she listens to you.
Detective Frost, do you have
Samantha Cole's lab binder?
Yeah. Right there.
But Samantha's in a coma
and her parents have an alibi.
Karine's alibi checked out, too,
so she didn't run over Mr. Sutton, either.
This is impressive for a college student,
much less a high-school student.
So why did Mr. Sutton give her that "D"?
It fits with Jane's theory he was demanding sex for grades.
So, he gave her a "D" when she said no.
Maybe somebody besides Samantha's parents
is angry enough to go after Sutton.
Did she have a boyfriend?
Doesn't look like it. I'm on her social network sites.
She was constantly posting
photos of her and her friends on candidgram.
Why would she post this photo?
Look at the comments.
Holy crap. Poor kid.
Seems like the entire student body
made a point of publicly calling her a slut.
Man. Kids are mean.
Why would a brilliant kid like Samantha
put a photo of herself in a bra online?
She didn't.
Detective Frost, did you happen to come across
Mr. Sutton's lesson planner?
Yeah. Right there. Second file box.
Okay, here's his lesson plan
for Samantha's driver's ed class 11 days ago.
3:00 to 4:30 p.M.,
Show students "death on the highway"
in room 12 and grade papers in shed.
Samantha was watching a film?
and Mr. Sutton had her phone.
He always collected his students' phones before class.
Jane was right -- Sutton knew
she was about to go to the principal and complain.
He went through her phone, looking for something
to discredit her and found that photo.
And attached it to a bogus e-mail,
sent it to his own phone, then showed it to the principal.
Just to make sure his bases were covered,
he also posted it on candidgram.
Girl's a slut. Problem solved.
Yeah, look at the date and time it was sent.
It was just a couple of hours
before samantha attempted suicide.
Frost, hit that link -- the one that says "Sweet 16."
Happy birthday! Happy birthday!
I met these girls at the crime scene.
Show us your new bra.
No.
Yeah, come on!
You guys have to turn your phones off, okay?
Remember, we promised that we wouldn't post stuff
without each other's permission, right?
Okay, okay!
Samantha's saying, "Don't post this."
Now show us.
This is silly!
Come on! You've been waiting a long time for your girls!
Because she's with her friends.
That photo wasn't for Mr. Sutton.
They look like women, but they're just kids.
That photo couldn have been more incent.
Open the one that says "Fab four."
You guys ready?
I have your back, and you have mine.
I'm there. We're square.
Till the end, we're friends.
Fab four! I would die for you!
Look at their wrists.
Turquoise embroidery thread.
Those are friendship bracelets.
"I would die for you."
I wonder if that also means, "I would kill for you."
D.A. wants us in the squad room.
But there's no evidence
that puts one of these three girls behind the wheel?
We found all three girls' prints in the car.
Whose are on the steering wheel?
Wheel was wiped clean.
What about evidence on the victim's body?
No, nothing that connects him to one of them.
Alibis?
Each girl has one.
Each of their parents said they saw her
in bed the night of the hit-and-run.
At least they're all cooperating.
I mean, go figure. I got a 16-year-old.
Can't even get her to unload the dishwasher.
They all refused to have either a lawyer or a parent present.
Not very smart.
That's 16 for you.
I even tried to talk them into having a lawyer present.
And I'm on the other side.
We need to know who was driving.
Yeah, they're best friends now,
but human nature says they'll turn on each other pretty quick.
They always do.
I mean, David Sutton is a predator,
but it does look like one of these girls mowed him down.
Well, let's split up. Each take a girl.
It's gonna be like shooting fish in a bucket.
We have evidence that you were in the shed with Mr. Sutton.
He was my hero.
He made me fall in love with science.
He -- he said that it was an art and that we were the artists.
What were you doing in that shed?
I had to record him.
Why?
Because he said that he'd give you a better grade
if you had sex with him?
Yeah.
He said that...
he'd fail me unless I gave him
oral sex.
Can you talk me through what happened?
He told me meet him at 11:00.
I turned my cellphone on
to record him.
And I stuck it in my shirt pocket.
And then what happened?
I turned my cellphone on.
What did you do?
I put it in my shirt pocket to record him.
He pulled his sweatpants down.
His legs were so gross.
What did he say to you?
It's all you have to do.
You do that...
I'll change your grade to an "A."
How simple is that?
I'd heard he did it to smart girls,
that a few even did it
just so that he didn't wreck their college applications.
He started with Samantha.
He gave her a "D."
But she still didn't do it,
so he made everyone think that she was a big slut.
That's why she tried to kill herself.
Why meet him alone?
I just wanted to make sure
that he never did it to another girl.
No one will believe me without proof.
So, what did he do?
He pulled down his underwear.
And he tried to touch my breast.
And that's when my phone fell out.
Are you taping this?
Where is that recording?
I erased it.
Why?
Because...
Because of what happened next?
Yeah.
I ran out into the parking lot.
He always left the keys to the driver's ed car
in the ignition.
I just had to get away. I was so scared.
Where did you go?
He was running after me.
I got to the car,
but I was so freaked out that...
I forgot how to drive.
Wait. What are you doing?
He ran in front of the car...
and I didn't see him.
I hit him.
Megan confessed.
Emma confessed, too.
So did Chloe.
Oh, god.
All three confessed?
Identical stories.
They worked this out, and there is no doubt in my mind
that all three are willing to take the blame and go to jail.
I've never seen anything like it.
We even went back at them, hard.
They're not giving each other up.
So, then, they did it.
Or one of them did.
Do you think it was deliberate?
No.
I think it was an accident,
and the skid marks actually could mean two things.
Either the car was lying in wait
or two scared teenagers skidded
to a stop to pick up a friend.
It explains the acceleration marks.
Whoever was driving jumped on the gas to get away from Sutton.
And the headlights were off
because they were inexperienced drivers.
Well, if that's the case,
then they didn't see him,
and he didn't see them.
Without corroborating evidence
or a confession and two witnesses,
there is no case.
I need to know the truth.
Only one of you was driving that car.
Who was it?
Me. I was driving.
If you weren't driving,
you're not responsible.
Tell me the truth.
It was me. I was the one.
I was driving.
You understand that you will go to prison.
And you will stay there...
...for the next 15 years of your life.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Can't you prosecute all three?
According to Massachusetts law,
we can only go after the driver.
We need one. We've got three.
So, what do we do?
Send them home to do their homework.
We can't do that.
He's right. We have no choice.
We got to let them go.
Try again.
Come on, Sam.
Open your eyes, Sam. Come on.
She's trying to open her eyes.
Samantha! Honey, can you hear me?
It's not really like the movies, is it?
No.
It'll be a long haul.
But she's responding, so who knows?
She might come all the way back.
I have your back, and you've got mine.
It's beautiful, though.
I'm there.
What is?
We're square.
Till the end...
That kind of friendship.
...We're friends.
I would die for you.
I mean, I don't know that I'd die for you,
but I'd -- I'd come damn close.
Me, too, Jane.
Me, too.
