the limu lipoa is always actually a type of seaweed .
in fact , the waters of waikiki
feature over 200 species of marine plants .
the black stuff on the ocean floor is coral ,
and the white stuff-- well , that &apos;s sand .
coming up on the port side , you &apos;ll see ...
just make sure you cc legal on that memo .
no , i said cc legal .
mom , look ! the rocks are so fuzzy !
i &apos;m going to have to call you back . i &apos;m on a submarine .
mom , it &apos;s nemo .
that fish looks like nemo .
one sec .
mom ...
a mermaid ! a mermaid !
oh , my god .
coast guard , coast guard ,
this is the submarine atlantis .
we &apos;ve got the body of female ...
good morning , lieutenant .
good morning , commander .
you know , uh ...
i think i owe you dinner .
yeah . somehow we just never ...
quite ... make it to dinner .
we had dinner in coronado .
no . we had reservations ...
you know we , uh , both have the day off today .
we could have breakfast on the beach .
or ...
or ...
i think i &apos;m vibrating .
no , i @-@ i think i &apos;m actually vibrating .
there goes your day off .
there &apos;s something different about you today .
you , uh , you get a new haircut ?
no .
new cargo pants ?
what was that ?
what ?
i believe you just smiled !
you @-@ you almost appear to be happy .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m a happy person ?
you know-- ha-- you know , i &apos;m sure you have your moments ,
you know , like when guns &amp; ammo
puts out their holiday gift guide ,
or a rambo retrospective comes on tv .
but when the governor calls us down
to the me &apos;s office on a saturday ,
i ask you what is it that you could be so happy about ?
oh , you had grace this weekend .
yeah . i just dropped her back off at rachel &apos;s .
so just to recap
i got a broken knee ,
i got a daughter i barely get to see ,
now i work on saturdays , okay ?
so , life &apos;s grand , know what i mean ?
it &apos;s good .
gentlemen , thank you for coming .
governor .
an 18 @-@ year @-@ old girl &apos;s body was found off waikiki this morning .
that &apos;s hpd &apos;s jurisdiction .
not this time .
oh , that &apos;s right .
you haven &apos;t met dr. bergman yet .
max is a tactile thinker .
playing music is part of his process .
some people say he &apos;s a savant . i think he &apos;s a genius .
max ?
trust me .
edematous airways .
what did he say ?
nice to meet you , too .
the victim exhibited pulmonary edema ,
petechial hemorrhaging , and froth in the airways .
cause of death is definitely drowning .
does that mean we &apos;re not dealing with a homicide ?
no . it doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re not dealing with a homicide .
oh , sorry .
that was a double negative .
it means , it still could be a homicide .
see these linear contusions on her wrists ?
they &apos;re antemortem .
ligature marks . mean she was restrained .
that &apos;s right .
she has defensive wounds as well .
so she put up a fight .
yes .
also , hello .
i &apos;m max bergman .
hello , max .
yeah , hi , max .
uh , governor , do we have an id on the victim ?
her name is amanda reeves .
her father &apos;s michael reeves ,
the u.s. ambassador to the philippines ,
and a very old friend .
which is why i promised i &apos;d put my two best people on it .
okay , uh ...
what are they doing in hawaii ?
they vacation here every year .
governor .
thanks , al .
the , uh ... girls went to a movie last night ,
but they never made it home .
i &apos;m sorry , you said girls ?
uh , as in more than one ?
oh ! sorry .
a @-@ amanda &apos;s sister , robin , is still missing .
the coast guard sent out divers this morning , but , uh ...
there &apos;s no sign of her .
so robin reeves may still be alive .
always wanted amanda and robin to have a .... com ...
... normal upbringing , but it hasn &apos;t been easy .
so they were stationed with you at the embassy in manila ?
yeah . for the last two years .
before that , it was , uh , budapest .
keeping the family together has always been ...
important to us .
yeah .
of course , growing up in foreign countries with a security detail
shadowing your every move is not exactly
an ideal childhood .
did they , by chance , have a detail with them
when they went out last night ?
well , in the philippines it &apos;s one thing ,
but we &apos;ve been coming to hawaii since the girls were little .
i guess we just didn &apos;t think it was necessary .
they were just going to the movies .
don &apos;t blame yourself . we &apos;re going to find robin .
we are .
we are . i promise .
that &apos;s quite a bit of firepower .
it &apos;s a kimber 1911 .
i prefer something with a little more kick .
not exactly diplomatic security standard issue .
which would make you ...
russell ellison , security consultant .
i specialize in vip
and corporate protection .
in light of what happened
to ambassador reeves , he called me in to bolster his detail .
so when did you get into town ?
this morning .
and if you don &apos;t mind , i have a lot of work to do .
aloha .
you know , it &apos;s possible that your daughters were targeted
because of your ambassadorship .
did you make any enemies during your time abroad ?
i &apos;m a representative of the united states
in an unstable region of the world .
it comes with the territory .
how about in the philippines itself ?
the u.s. gives a lot of aid to that country .
most of the population is grateful for our assistance .
yeah , but not everybody appreciates the help .
i mean , there &apos;s always radical elements
who resent our presence .
michael , did any of them ever threaten you ?
office receives dozens of threats .
the security bureau keeps all of that on file .
mrs. reeves ,
you were a founding partner in sowersby financial .
is it true that you recently sold
your stake in that company ?
yes , but how is that relevant ?
well , because , ma &apos;am ,
you just cashed out of sowersby for over $ 12 million .
if we have that information ,
it &apos;s safe to assume that other people do , too .
what ... ? are you saying amanda &apos;s dead &apos; cause i have money ?
i &apos;m sorry , uh , ma &apos;am ,
these high @-@ profile cases are usually about money .
then how come there hasn &apos;t been a ransom demand ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh !
hi .
yeah .
um ... steve had to leave for work ,
and he told me i should just let myself out ,
so ...
um ... you must be ...
the sister . i &apos;m mary . yeah .
i &apos;m just visiting from l.a.
big night last night .
old house . thin walls .
oh , god !
yeah . you said that a lot .
it &apos;s embarrassing .
don &apos;t sweat it .
i just broke up with my boyfriend ,
so i plan on having a lot of guys over soon .
so it &apos;ll be a fair fight .
hey . checked with state .
no credible threats against the ambassador
in the last three months .
okay , so this doesn &apos;t add up-- why kill one girl
and keep the other one alive ?
well , if it &apos;s a ransom attempt ,
it could be to show that they mean business .
hpd has a unit at the house . still no ransom call .
so we got no motive .
okay , so we focus on how the girls were abducted .
75 % of kidnappings
are usually carried out by people the victims already knew .
we ran a background check on the ambassador &apos;s staff ,
and everyone seems clean .
what about the new guy ?
that security consultant , russell ellison .
his story checks out .
ambassador just flew him in from the mainland ,
and , uh , his plane touched down
after the girls were abducted .
mcgarrett .
on our way .
let &apos;s go , big guy .
just got back the toxicology report .
the victim had benzodiazepine in her blood .
you may be more familiar with its street name-- roofies .
yeah , it &apos;s a date rape drug .
yeah , it &apos;s not that often a girl gets roofied at the movies .
you could have told us this on the phone .
i don &apos;t trust phones .
okay . uh , kono said that the daughters
had a reputation for being , uh , party girls .
do you have a black light ?
oh . it &apos;s called an als wand .
and i don &apos;t like people touching my equipment .
can i just have the wand , please ?
fine .
zephyr lounge .
it &apos;s a nightclub .
just sent us a link
to remotely access their closed @-@ circuit feeds .
that &apos;s really good . it &apos;s impressive .
did you learn that in seal school ?
yeah , it &apos;s called using the internet .
people have been doing it since the early &apos; 90s .
you may have heard of it .
i wouldn &apos;t know .
i was still playing ms. pac @-@ man .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
ever make it to the double pretzel level ?
triple banana , bitch .
you &apos;re a liar .
no , i &apos;m not .
all right , give me last night &apos;s front door
and start at midnight and roll backwards .
right there . right there .
whoa , whoa . okay , roll forward .
there you go . zoom right here .
uh @-@ huh .
what &apos;s that look like to you ?
like two blonde victims and a creepy guy .
got him .
you boys on the list ?
yeah . uh , vip .
you know this guy ?
yeah . he &apos;s inside .
hey . two longboards .
what are you doing ?
breaking for beers ?
this guy &apos;s just abducted two girls .
his radar is going to be up .
he sees us before we see him , he &apos;s going to bolt .
so let &apos;s just have a couple of beers ,
get eyes on the place and relax .
this place has got eyes on you .
would you focus , please ?
just ... just once . just focus .
okay , wait a minute .
let me ask you a question .
go ahead .
two very attractive ladies are eye @-@ humping you--
uh , respectably-- and @-@ and what , nothing ?
nothing ? i mean , what , should i check for a pulse ?
you alive ? hello .
what is that ? what is that smile ?
what smile ?
that stupid smile .
what is it with you today ?
huh ?
you &apos;re imagining things .
oh , i &apos;m imagining things .
that &apos;s right .
wait a minute . wait a minute .
some detective i am .
you got into some barry white last night , did &apos;t you ?
huh ? am i right or am i right ?
you &apos;re very perceptive .
thank you .
take a look at casanova over there-- 6 : 00 .
that &apos;s our boy .
let me tell you what i &apos;d like to do .
if that was my daughter , i would bust
every single one of his fingers
one at a time .
oh , god .
thank you for the excuse .
excuse me . excuse me .
whoa . put the drink down .
it &apos;s time for you to go to the bathroom .
dude .
who do you think you are ? huh ?
what &apos;s that ?
who do i think i am ?
i think i might be a guy
who just saw another guy put something in a lady &apos;s drink .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you don &apos;t ?
i didn &apos;t put anything in her drink .
you didn &apos;t put anything ...
then , drink it .
what ?
drink it . come here .
drink ... listen to me .
drink that drink , or i &apos;m going to bust your teeth
and pour it down your throat , okay ?
i would drink it .
let me help you .
come on .
down the hatch .
big swallow . big swallow .
good job . okay , let &apos;s go .
robin reeves .
what &apos;d you do with her ?
what ?
great . now he &apos;s deaf .
where is she ?
where is robin reeves ?
here &apos;s your rap sheet here .
you got credit card fraud ,
corruption of a minor , statutory rape ,
and now you graduated to murder . congratulations .
murder ?
yeah .
what are you talking about ?
well , they found amanda reeves &apos; body this morning .
i didn &apos;t kill that girl .
no ? well , you better know who did , then .
okay . okay .
i did slip those girls a roof last night .
why those girls ? why &apos;d you pick them ?
i just did what i was told .
but they were alive when i handed them off to kang .
who &apos;s kang ?
the one who set me up with the job .
said he &apos;d give me five grand for every girl i brought him .
what does he do with the girls ?
i get paid to supply the girls ,
not to ask questions .
okay , so how do we find kang ?
i don &apos;t know , honestly . i ...
he never even told me his last name .
i don &apos;t even know his phone number .
how do you deliver the girls to kang ?
how does that happen ?
he leaves a van parked in one of the lots .
okay , go on .
i put the girls in the back ,
take the van to ala wai , and i park it by the canal .
the next day , it &apos;s back in the parking lot
with five grand in the glove box and instructions
for the next drop @-@ off .
so that girl you were going to drug tonight--
is she your next delivery ?
yeah .
yeah , i was ... supposed to get her there by 1 : 00 .
that &apos;s less than an hour .
hang tight , kono .
we &apos;ll be right behind you .
bravo team , target &apos;s turning
southeast on kuhio .
copy that .
kuhio avenue-- it &apos;s a red @-@ light district at night .
yeah , sex tre , kidnapped girls .
it &apos;s got to be forced prostitution .
yeah .
teenagers like amanda and robin are prime targets .
you know , tamara , the hawaii chair
wasn &apos;t designed just for home .
i mean , after all , for some of us ,
at least 40 hours of our week is spent
sitting behind a desk at the office .
so , to see what office workers think of the hawaii chair ,
we sent erin lee to work .
hi . i &apos;m erin lee with ...
seriously ?
sitting ?
that &apos;s a workout ?
let &apos;s get some first @-@ time reactions .
oh , my gosh . this is amazing .
that feels great on my abs .
i can really feel this working .
oh , my god !
make it stop !
... using the computer ,
balancing books or filing paperwork .
you can hardly call this work .
with the hawaii chair , it takes the work
out of your workday .
* if you can sit *
* you can get fit *
* the hawaii chair *
come on .
you don &apos;t have batteries ?
how do you power your night vision goggles ?
it &apos;s not the best time , mare .
why are there pictures of burned corpses in the study ?
what are you talking about ?
i found this tool kit ,
and it has all this weird stuff in it , like a tape recorder ,
crime scene photos and some ...
postcards from japan .
put the box back , okay ? it &apos;s evidence .
evidence of what ?
something dad was investigating .
a case he was working on .
he wanted me to find it .
why ?
mary , please ... do me a favor
and just put the box back for now , okay ?
okay , okay , i will .
tell me you &apos;re putting the box back .
relax . i will .
thank you .
bye .
everything okay ?
probably not .
what happened to the music ?
party &apos;s inside .
let &apos;s go .
kono , try and get a 20 on robin .
okay . close quarters with an unknown number of hostiles .
robin reeves is not
the only girl in there , so watch your crossfire , okay ?
we also have a uc in there .
five @-@ nine , local girl ,
black top , black hot pants .
she &apos;s one of ours , so look sharp .
miss liao .
excellent skin .
bone structure very good .
strong , too .
you &apos;ll be a good earner .
all right , i &apos;ve heard enough .
hold tight , we &apos;re coming in .
go .
on the ground before i put you there .
on the ground !
freeze ! right there !
building &apos;s secure .
where &apos;s robin ?
she &apos;s not here .
robin reeves-- where is she ?
i never see that girl .
well , seeing as you &apos;re not even bothering to look ,
maybe you &apos;ll remember that she was with her sister amanda ,
and maybe you &apos;ll want to know that she &apos;s dead now .
i want you read my miranda right now .
preferably in chinese .
my english not so good .
what you do ...
what you doing ? what you doing ?
no ! give me !
sit down !
give me !
shut up .
give us a minute .
yeah , sure .
she ordered the kidnapping of the reeves sisters ,
but it wasn &apos;t for the prostitution ring .
she tell you where robin is ?
doesn &apos;t know .
according to her , the reeves girls never even passed through here .
a private buyer paid her 50,000 to abduct them and hand them over .
said the kidnapping was a freelance job .
so it had nothing to do with sex trade .
someone was targeting them specifically .
you get a name on a buyer ?
all she had was
the phone number she used to communicate with the guy .
said she was paid by wire .
this will help .
how &apos;d you get her to talk ?
told her the dog would be put down
once she went to lockup .
promised i &apos;d find it a home .
if she cooperated .
what ?
it &apos;s not like it &apos;s the dog &apos;s fault .
so i ran the phone number on our private buyer .
turns out , the calls were made from a disposable cell phone ,
which is untraceable .
that &apos;s right .
but i was able to pull the call logs .
and get this : since the reeves sisters went missing ,
three calls were placed from that cell phone
to the ambassador &apos;s private number .
so you think that he &apos;s somehow involved
in his own daughter &apos;s disappearance ?
no .
no , this is a kidnap and ransom .
yeah , they &apos;re calling the ambassador to make demands .
that &apos;s why he brought ellison in after the girls went missing .
ellison , the &quot; security consultant . &quot;
i will bet you he &apos;s not a security consultant .
that guy is a k &amp; r specialist .
what &apos;s k &amp; r ?
kidnap and ransom .
it &apos;s a type of insurance .
look , if the policy holder gets abducted ,
the company comes in , they pay the ransom
and they supervise the exchange with the kidnappers .
and these guys got a tendency to obstruct police investigations .
so , if ellison is handling the drop ,
that explains why the ambassador lied to us .
is your husband home ?
we uh , we need to have a word .
no , i ... he had to step out for a meeting .
with mr. ellison ?
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s going on ?
mrs. reeves , we know that the kidnappers
have been in communication with your husband .
he hired russell ellison to broker the deal ,
isn &apos;t that right ?
sarah .
sarah , if you know something , you have to tell them .
i &apos;m so sorry i lied to you .
last call came in an hour ago , and the man on the end said
that if we paid the money ,
we &apos;d get robin back .
so your husband and ellison have gone to pay the ransom .
please , i just want my daughter back .
as soon as the kidnappers made contact ,
michael called mr. ellison .
he flew in with the money .
he monitored all the calls .
he told michael exactly
what to do and say .
did your husband say
where the transaction was taking place ?
no , no . mr. ellison wouldn &apos;t let him give me any details .
did ellison ask you to lie ?
he said involving the police
would only put robin in more danger .
excuse me .
yeah ?
i just traced the money trail
for that private buyer who paid for
the abduction of the reeves sisters .
the payment was wired from a bank in the philippines .
the account belongs to a carlos bagoyo ,
known member of the national liberation front ,
operational in rural luzon .
they bombed a military base there in &apos; 08 .
lately they &apos;ve taken to targeting u.s. troops
within the country .
of course they have . because we support
the democratically @-@ elected government that keeps them out of power .
doesn &apos;t sound like they &apos;d be interested in a ransom .
they &apos;re not .
they didn &apos;t kidnap his daughters for money ,
this is political .
if they &apos;re targeting the ambassador ,
he must have something they want .
yeah .
and he just dropped his security detail to go meet with them .
listen , all the cars in the dsb motor pool
have vehicle transponders , okay ?
i need a location on the car the ambassador left in .
government plates . it &apos;s him .
tires are still warm .
they can &apos;t have gone too far .
ellison probably sent the ambassador in solo
to make the swap , but he &apos;ll be nearby
monitoring with a tac team to make sure it doesn &apos;t bad .
and you know what ?
i may have a way to figure out
where he &apos;s running surveillance from .
yeah , i figured you would .
you &apos;re gonna like this .
was wondering when you were gonna call .
you get in late last night ?
i actually haven &apos;t been home yet .
interesting .
no , no , it &apos;s not what it sounds like .
i caught a high @-@ priority case .
okay , why am i getting the feeling
that you &apos;re about to ask me for another favor ?
listen , i &apos;ll make it up to you , all right ?
we &apos;ll finally get that dinner ,
and you &apos;ll get to taste the best steak on the island .
who you talking to ?
all right , you got yourself a deal .
what do you need ?
pacom has a satellite dedicated to honolulu harbor .
can you use it to run a scan on radio traffic ?
yeah , what am i looking for ?
uh , spread spectrum signal in the 400 mhz range .
type used by high @-@ end surveillance gear .
all right , one sec .
thanks , cath .
oh , catherine . i should &apos;ve known .
that &apos;s who you were getting right with last night .
that &apos;s stunning detective work .
well done .
you know , it &apos;s amazing .
now , she @-@ she catches bad guys for you and she sleeps with you .
does she cook , too ?
yeah , she does . she &apos;s a great cook .
roger that . we &apos;ve got eyes on the northern avenue of approach .
what &apos;s your status ?
all right , i think i got a hit on your frequency .
i &apos;m tying you in right now .
overwatch on reeves is good .
we &apos;re standing by .
all right , that &apos;s our boy .
can you get a vector on the signal source ?
all right , the west end of the dock .
it &apos;s coming from a shipping container .
what are you doing ?
lower your weapons !
right now ! lower your gun !
you can &apos;t come in here . you &apos;re gonna get
this girl killed .
we &apos;re gonna get this girl killed ?
hey !
you obstructed our investigation !
now unless your men are ready
to shoot a couple of cops ,
tell them to holster their weapons now .
right now , buddy .
drop &apos;em .
where &apos;s the ambassador ?
he &apos;s in position for the drop .
pull him out now .
with all due respect ,
my team specializes in these situations .
we want to get robin home to her family .
of course you do , because if you don &apos;t ,
your firm is on the hook for six million , right ?
the man who kidnapped the ambassador &apos;s daughters
is a part of a filipino terrorist group .
sir , they just arrived .
this is not about cash , gentlemen .
they lured him in .
look at that , robin is not with them .
patch me into the ambassador .
all right , listen , they &apos;re here .
i want you to be calm and do exactly as we already discussed .
you know who i am ?
carlos bagoyo .
you &apos;re an operative of the nlf ,
responsible for the zamboanga bombings
that killed 78 people .
i see you read your security briefs .
where is she ?
where &apos;s my daughter ?
she &apos;s nearby .
when we get what we want ,
we will release her .
you didn &apos;t come all this way for my money , did you ?
i &apos;m afraid not , ambassador .
we came for you .
what do you want ?
your country sends military aid to the philippine regime .
you put guns in the hands
of soldiers that kill our sons and brothers .
i don &apos;t understand .
there &apos;s a u.s. shipment of m @-@ 4 machine guns
en route to manila .
you &apos;re gonna tell me where they are right now and we &apos;re gonna
use those weapons to take our country back .
i don &apos;t have that kind of information .
as ambassador , you coordinate military aid
with the state department ,
which means you have access to the classified server .
now if you ever want to see your daughter alive again ,
log in .
all right , he finds out where that shipment is ,
he can send a team in to hijack it .
we cannot let him get to those weapons .
tell the perimeter team to gear up .
wait a minute . what are you doing ?
we &apos;re running out of options . we gotta move in .
we don &apos;t need to do anything . you need to pull your men out
so my partner and i can clean up your mess .
move out now . i &apos;m not gonna tell you again !
come on .
your wife already lost one daughter .
are you prepared to tell her your other child died
because you wouldn &apos;t do what was asked ?
ambassador , this is commander mcgarrett .
stay calm , listen .
tell them that you &apos;re willing to cooperate ,
but first you need to see your daughter .
we cannot move in
until we know where she is , you understand ?
fingerprint and password , ambassador , now !
please trust me .
do as i ask you .
tell carlos you &apos;re willing to cooperate ,
but first you need to see robin .
ambassador , do it , please .
you &apos;re asking me to commit treason against my country .
and i will do as you ask ,
but not until i know she &apos;s safe .
i want to see robin .
she &apos;s on her way .
they &apos;re bringing robin in . we need to get a visual .
you &apos;re kidding me .
no , i &apos;m not kidding .
come here . look , this one controls the camera feed ,
the joystick is for pans and zoom , okay ?
it &apos;s just like ms. pac @-@ man . it &apos;s very easy .
they &apos;re holding the ambassador on dry dock number seven .
and the daughter ?
she &apos;s not on @-@ site ,
but bagoyo has just agreed to provide proof of life .
we think he &apos;s holding her in a nearby location .
as soon as we get eyes on robin , we can move in .
okay , we got a boat coming in .
got her .
all right , that &apos;s us . we &apos;re going , danny .
okay , i &apos;ll just be here in the penalty box .
we still clear ?
you are all good .
daddy !
robin .
robin .
go .
okay , hold up , hold up .
you got two at the south entrance .
one of them &apos;s making the rounds , coming your way right now .
he &apos;s coming up right behind you .
he &apos;ll be on you in about ten seconds .
wait .
wait for it .
now , now .
that &apos;s enough .
no , no , no , no , please , please ? !
ambassador , you &apos;ve seen your daughter .
now log in .
my patience is wearing thin , ambassador .
do it or she dies .
robin ?
it &apos;s okay .
you guys okay ?
yeah .
all right .
listen , i &apos;m man enough to know when i &apos;m wrong .
thank you . you both have great instincts ,
and if you ever consider
coming down to the private sector ,
you should give me a call .
men with your skill sets deserve to be compensated .
i know . well , thank you very much . i totally agree .
oh , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m getting compensation .
you obstructed a criminal investigation .
that is an arrestable offense .
well , you and i both know
that the charges will never stick .
yeah , maybe not , but it &apos;s going to take your firm
at least 24 hours to get a lawyer here from los angeles .
i &apos;m gonna make sure that you spend that time in jail .
book him , danno .
you know , i got to be honest .
i actually didn &apos;t mind that one .
really ?
