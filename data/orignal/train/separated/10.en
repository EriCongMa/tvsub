第五季 第十八集
Is your first name "Jeff"?
Yes.
Are you currently in Illinois?
Yes.
Did you pick the number 12?
Yes.
Are you now a member of any group that advocates
the violent overthrow of the United States government?
No.
Is your first name "Jeff"? Yes.
Do you work for the National Security Agency?
Yes.
Have you ever discussed confidential materials with individuals
not employed with the National Security Agency?
No.
Did you pick the number eight?
No.
Have you ever removed confidential materials from the workplace?
No.
Did you pick the number 12?
Yes.
Are you currently in communication with any foreign national?
It's not "Baby blue's soul."
It's "Boy's soul."
That's what Mac thinks it is, not what it is.
What is it, Dell?
Uh, it's both. First chorus and second.
* You got to pay the troll toll *
* If you want to get into that boy's soul... *
Shut up, J.
Anything going on?
Cary's on with Clarke.
They're worried about Alicia.
She's still in bed?
Yeah.
Do you want me to call her?
Alicia? No.
She just needs a little time.
What's wrong?
Well, I was just talking to--
Sorry, Clarke, I can't hear you.
I'm at Lockhart/Gardner and I can't--
Hello.
I was here about the joint client agreement
and Diane Lockhart just asked me when we were coming in
to discuss the merger.
"Merger"?
Yes. Are we merging with Lockhart/Gardner?
Um, uh... I think this is something coming from Alicia.
They want our clients, Cary.
They don't want us.
If we merge, they will squeeze us out.
We're the small fish. They're the big.
I know. Let me talk to Alicia.
You--
Go ahead.
I don't want to be the one saying this;
and you must understand,
I'm speaking purely about the bottom line--
We have to make decisions without Alicia.
Yes. Clearly, she is having...
some difficulties.
You are a co-managing partner.
In her absence, it's within your rights.
Did they add questions to your last test?
What?
Your last lie detector test,
did they add any other questions?
I don't know. I guess.
They always do. Why?
Like what questions?
Uh, nothing. They just usually keep it to the same 20 questions.
But they added one? What was it?
"Did you take any confidential materials home?"
Yeah, they're worried about the next Snowden.
Shut up, J.
No. He's right.
Someone in this office
has been leaking information to the press.
How do they know that?
IP addresses or something.
That's why they've doubled up on the lie detector tests.
Are you worried?
No.
No. It's just more crap.
You know what you got to do?
What?
* You gotta fight *
* For your right *
* To ma... sturbate. *
Hello.
I have another legal problem.
Finn?
Yeah.
Yeah. They told me you were at home.
I am. I'm heading out now.
They've taken my computer.
Who has?
I don't know.
I returned from court and I'm staring at a computer
that looks like mine,
but they've stuck the Post-it notes in the wrong places.
Well, what was on it?
Everything.
Anything that can hurt you?
I don't think so, but...
...it does have my notes for the Jeffrey Grant prosecution.
Okay. Let me talk to the state's attorney.
I'd rather do it.
No. You need a lawyer.
Don't be your own lawyer.
You know, they did ask me a new question.
What?
On the lie detector test,
they asked me a new question.
What?
Did I know any co-worker
who took confidential materials home?
And what'd you say?
Well, I said, "No."
Was that wrong?
No.
I'm sorry. I was under the impression
Alicia was the named partner.
Yes, and there's an Agos to her Florrick.
Who's that?
Cary. Talking about the merger.
But why wasn't I brought into the loop?
He sounds different.
Yeah, I know.
Alicia doesn't control this firm.
It's both of ours.
Then consider it, Cary.
A merger would benefit both of us.
No. It would benefit you.
You're overextended.
We are both overextended.
No. We're a start-up.
Our natural state is to be overextended.
You are mismanaged.
Yeah. He's kicking ass.
Now, all I'm saying is,
we need three-year guarantee of untouched Chumhum revenues.
We'll give you one year.
Diane...
I'm not negotiating. I'm stating.
Um... I have to go.
Uh, talk to Alicia.
I mean, see what she wants.
Well, Alicia's out sick
and I'm making the decisions in the meantime.
Good to know.
So, are we merging or what?
We need to do something.
I've been in the New York office.
We need more Chicago support.
Actually, I've had a change of heart.
I think we should hold off on any merger talk.
Really?
Florrick/Agos not coming together?
I think we should take some time
before we make such a big decision.
I would tend to agree.
Well, when you argued so passionately about a merger,
Diane, I made a couple of calls
and discovered a possible suitor.
Don't you want to know who?
Hello. I'm Louis Canning.
I know some of you, and some of you I want to get to know.
Diane.
First things first,
uh, these movements that you see
are from a neurological disorder I suffer from,
called tardive dyskinesia.
Well, we don't discriminate here.
If people vote against our merger,
I'm sure it'll be for other reasons
than your disorder.
I want to say how much...
I respected Will Gardner.
In fact, I'm a bit overwhelmed just sitting this far--
Sorry.
This far from his office.
I'm sure he's smiling down on us and saying,
"Don't make any dumb decisions."
Dear God. Are you really thinking of
putting the fox in charge?
Diane, just because he has a condition--
He bankrupted us. Remember?
We went to bankruptcy court because of him?
Diane, I know we've been on opposite sides
with other cases, but...
I'm sincere when I say I need what you have.
And you need what I have.
What do you have?
Infrastructure in New York and L.A.
Don't reveal all your crime scene photos at once,
or the jury will become immune.
"The truth must dazzle gradually,
else every man be blind"
Mrs. Florrick.
Come on in.
Then deliberately hand the photos to the jury.
You want them to touch them,
feel responsible for them...
in order to encourage your defendant
to accept a plea bargain...
Great. Go forth,
and do likewise.
Double homicide on 51st.
So...
am I a disappointment to your husband?
What?
No.
Just, um...
having trouble getting him on the phone.
Well, he's...
busy.
Are you okay?
Yes. May I sit down?
Yeah, of course. Would you like some water?
No.
Why did you take Finn Polmar's computer?
Did I take Finn Polmar's computer?
Finn Polmar's computer was taken
and he works for you.
Well, there's a disciplinary panel
established by my predecessor, your husband.
The Internal Standards Unit. It is investigating Finn's case.
If we're talking about the Jeffrey Grant prosecution,
we already...
No.
All Finn's cases.
Sondra?
Do you have my other shirts? I spilled juice on it.
He's just sitting at your desk.
He won't talk to me.
Who?
This is Cary Agos. You can tell him.
Hey. What do you need?
Hello.
I need a lawyer.
You work for the NSA?
I'm an independent contractor.
For the NSA?
Yes.
And... that's all you can tell us?
I think I'm in trouble.
I need legal advice.
What kind of trouble?
I took home a flash drive from work, um...
and I uploaded something to my home computer.
Okay. What was on it?
A valentine, for my sister's kids.
I drew it up at work,
but there were some... confidential things
on the flash drive, too, and they're asking questions about it.
"They're"?
My system admin.
We get weekly lie detector tests.
They're... they're asking if anything confidential went home.
Alicia, hello.
The NSA is no joke.
You can't talk on the phone, or e-mail or text about me
or anything to do with me.
We use burners,
and we change them up every three days.
No, you can't use any phones.
I'm serious.
Why? Are they listening to us?
No.
Then what are you worried about?
Every call you make,
every text, every e-mail any of us makes,
it's-it's sucked up and stored by the NSA
until it serves some later purpose.
There are word searches that could pop my name
or my circumstances up to the top.
Okay. Give us a day to discuss strategy.
Actually, we need to discuss this.
No, we don't.
Why can't you tell them
you took the flash drive home accidentally?
Everyone is worried about the next Snowden.
They won't believe me.
I don't want to disappear one night.
Okay.
Come by tomorrow, this time.
What happened to discussing cases?
We've had to make decisions while you were out.
We can't take on any cases involving the U.S. Government.
We did at Lockhart/Gardner.
Yes, and when we're as big as Lockhart/Gardner...
You don't need to get involved.
Alicia Florrick.
Alicia, how are you?
Mr. Canning?
That's right. I'm just calling to check in.
well, is there something you need?
Well, come to think of it, yes.
I-I need my client back.
Your client?
Which one is your client?
Chumhum.
Wh-What's this about, Mr. Canning?
Oh, that's right, you haven't heard.
Uh, my firm is merging with Lockhart/Gardner.
We're Lockhart/Gardner/Canning, now.
We decided to keep Will's name.
It was a nice gesture, don't you think?
Oh, wait a minute.
Sorry, I...
lost my pen, I...
almost got it.
Almost.
No. I can't, I'm sorry. Would you mind?
Sure.
Thanks.
I'm just getting used to my new surroundings.
You got it?
No.
Ah, my hero.
Thank you.
You needed something?
Is that Will's?
Why don't I come back later?
Wait.
Look, I know he's your friend
and I know you hate that I'm here.
But I'm gonna have to go over Will's last 20 cases,
and I need everything you got.
No, no, no. The real information.
The state of all investigations,
total result in costs, bad facts, good facts.
I need everything you got.
Kalinda, I'm your boss now. I need your help, please.
Great, last 20 cases going back to July.
I need everything that he sent out
to New York or L.A.
Okay.
I know it's your instinct to run back to Diane,
and tell her everything I just asked for.
And my guess is it wouldn't make a damn bit of difference
if I told you it was confidential, so it's not.
But you're gonna have to learn to trust me real quick.
I'm the new Will.
You're not the new Will.
So, we discussed it, and we have a plan.
You need to be a whistleblower.
I...? - You're not protected if you took home
the flash drive accidentally.
But you are protected if you took
the flash drive home due to wrongdoing.
Well, what "wrongdoing"?
Well, that's the question.
Have you seen any wrongdoing?
No, seriously.
We have something worked out for you.
But you have to do exactly what we say.
Okay. First you go back to work.
And you act like it's a normal day.
There's a new one.
Russian car crash video?
Yeah.
Cows?
No, men with machetes.
I've seen it.
Not this one.
It goes on like that for a mile!
I love Russians.
You all set?
And then when they tell you to take the lie detector test,
you go and you answer honestly.
About everything?
Yes.
Is your first name Jeff?
Yes.
Did you pick the number four?
Yes.
Have you ever removed confidential materials from the workplace?
Yes.
Are you currently in Illinois?
Yes.
And then you lay the groundwork for your defense.
What?
Do you know what Froines is doing?
Huh?
Froines, our system admin?
Do you know what he's doing?
Probably nothing.
No, he's checking up on his ex-wife.
He's digging her calls out of the Bit bucket.
So?
I just think it's wrong.
Yeah, okay.
You know it's wrong?
They won't think it's wrongdoing.
That's why you go to the office of the general counsel.
Yes?
And this is what you say...
I work as an independent contractor for the NSA,
and I want to report wrongdoing within the company.
I'm sorry?
Before I go further,
this report must remain confidential,
and there can be no repercussions for me.
That's true.
On multiple occasions, I have observed my supervisor
monitoring his ex-wife's calls and e-mails.
And then it will no longer
be about your suspicious removal of the flash drive.
You removed it because you're a whistleblower.
That protects you.
And that's it?
Yep.
You go back to your workstation and you relax.
That's odd.
Cary Argos just mentioned the NSA.
In what context?
I can't tell, he's in the background.
Background of what?
Clarke Hayden had his phone on speaker.
Cary was passing by, talking to someone
and he said something about the NSA.
Maybe they're suing us again.
Shut up, J.
Let me hear it.
You have to look for a way
to hand off non-billable tasks.
Look, it's the NSA.
That's the value prop...
What? I couldn't hear anything. Turn it up.
...have to look for a way to hand off
non-billable tasks.
Look, it's the NSA.
That's value proposition of support staff.
That's it.
It's probably nothing.
He just read something online or something.
Jeff?
Do you have a minute?
Sure.
You said Mr. Froines was using surveillance facilities
to follow his ex-wife?
That's right.
You're accusing me of what?
Well, thank you for meeting me.
No problem.
I don't want to be the enemy.
You're not the enemy.
Good.
You're the devil.
That's why you need me.
How can you be an angel if you don't let me be the devil?
That makes no sense.
Your partner Will cut some corners.
And I'm-I'm not criticizing him, because
he was only doing the dirty work that you didn't want to do.
He was the one...
Uh, Mr. Canning?
You're in his office, you're taking his cases.
What more do you want?
I want your respect.
Another martini.
I'm not the same man I was,
Diane, I've changed.
Good for you.
You're fighting me.
It's not gonna work if you're fighting me.
Said the rapist to his prey.
That's incredibly offensive.
Mr. Canning, you really want my respect?
Then stop playing games.
Stop treating me like I'm one of your marks.
Just talk.
Use words to communicate your needs and desires.
I want a home.
I've been drifting, and...
I need a place to call my own.
This is that place.
Okay.
Come on in. We're ready.
Finn has exercised his right
to have his lawyer in the session.
And you're welcome, Mrs. Florrick.
I didn't realize the State's Attorney
was part of the unit.
I appointed him.
Good to see you, Jimmy.
Finn.
Uh, Mr. Polmar and I have taken the liberty
to explain in depth any questions that you might have
about his prosecutions with the Cooke County
State's Attorney's Office.
This is a summary of the evidence
and how much he worked with Mr. Castro on each defense.
Prosecution.
Prosecutions.
Thank you.
And does this cover the detention order?
Excuse me?
Finn's detention orders in these cases.
We were told this was about the four prosecutions.
Three prosecutions.
Yes.
Right. Three.
This was not about Jeffrey Grant.
Yes, but it's about the detentions in his cases.
What does this inscription here mean?
"GenDen."
You know what it means.
I know it usually means "General detention."
Transferring a defendant into the general population
with other criminals.
To encourage a defendant to accept a plea bargain.
That is standard operating procedure.
Will Gardner was shot and killed
by Jeffrey Grant.
Jeffrey Grant grabbed the gun because he was being
intimidated and harassed in general pop.
You put him there, Finn.
He's right. I did it, I...
I did it, I transferred him to general population.
That's why he killed Will.
Clarke?
I need you to take a case for me.
Which one? Finn Polmar.
Why?
I'm not in a position to defend him anymore.
Uh, would you excuse me?
Mr. Dellinger?
I've been suspended.
You have? You can't be.
The system admin was in the meeting
and accused me of spying on him.
They can't be doing that.
They did.
They lowered my security status to a red badge.
And you can't be saying "NSA" anywhere.
It was picked up on his speaker phone.
We've been very careful about it.
They've assigned me a new office.
I count Styrofoam cups all day!
I need to get my job back!
Okay.
We'll file a discrimination suit against the NSA.
I think it's best to handle this as a common workplace issue.
How did you know that?
How did I know what?
How did you know that someone picked up NSA
from Clarke's speakerphone?
No, I said "It could be picked up on his speakerphone."
No, you said, "It was."
Then I made a mistake.
Hello. It's Alicia.
Mom?
I need to tell you who's in our conference room right now.
What? You can't...
You're listening to us, aren't you?
Tell me, or I swear to God, I will say your name.
Guess who's here needing a lawyer.
Mom, are you all right?
Okay, okay. Yes, we are.
We're listening. Just hang up.
I'll talk to you later, Grace.
Tell us everything... now.
He can't break confidentiality,
or he'll be in real... or he'll be in real trouble.
Wait a minute. Wait! Why us?
It's not you. It's not personal.
Of course it's personal.
There was a FISA warrant...
But why? What did we do?
No, it's not what you did.
You-You had a client, Danny Marla.
Oh, dear God! Are you freaking kidding me?!
The translator at Lockhart/Gardner?
He is not a terrorist.
Well, he's a terrorist sympathizer,
and you're the wife of the governor...
So why are you listening?
But wait a minute.
You're listening to Peter?
It's a three-hop warrant.
We're not intentionally...
A three-hop? So it's not just us.
It's anyone we talk to and anyone they talk to?
No.
Then what?!
It's anyone you talk to.
It's three hops from you.
Get everybody off their phones!
Hey, no phones. Get people off their computers!
Don't hit send.
Use this... and pen and paper.
Hello?
Alicia, I just wanted to...
Eli, I was just on my way to your office.
Oh, that's okay. This will only take a second.
No, I'm on my way. I'll see you in a minute.
Alicia, I was hoping to get those files
for Mr. Polmar's case.
No, I decided to stay on it.
Can you ask Robyn to get whatever she can
from the state's attorney's office's correspondence?
State's attorney's office?
Okay, sounds good.
Alicia, you didn't have to.
It was just a quick call.
You can't use your phones anymore.
What?
You can't call me on the phone anymore.
Why?
Let's go into your office.
Hello.
Hi.
Alicia was just saying we-we can't call her.
The NSA is listening to us.
How do you know this?
I can't say, but I believe the information is good.
When did they start listening?
Before you were elected.
We discussed the ballot box investigation.
Eli, if you're gonna discuss this,
I should go. I don't want to be subpoenaed.
Thank you, Alicia.
Do you believe it?
I don't know.
There's a lot of paranoia going around these days.
Who's our newest intern?
Why?
Adam, the guy with the beard.
Adam?
Would you mind if I borrow your cell phone?
Senator, Peter Florrick.
Peter!
How are you?
State or federal?
Federal.
I'm good.
Senator, the reason I'm calling,
it's about this NSA surveillance.
Yeah, that bastard Snowden.
The public doesn't get why it's necessary.
Ah, yeah, well, I think I'm with the public on this one
because I've heard a rumor
that I've been targeted by the NSA.
What?
Yeah. My wife and her law firm also.
No, they don't go after governors.
There's too much downside.
Well, listen, Bill,
I know you're with the Senate Intelligence Committee,
and could you just check around for me?
Sure, I'll look into it.
Great. Thanks.
You think he'll tell the truth?
No.
Okay.
Is there something I should know about you and Alicia?
No.
You're monosyllabic these days.
Yeah.
And in the three years as his supervisor,
have you ever given Mr. Dellinger a negative work evaluation?
Yes, this week.
And before that?
No.
And was this negative evaluation this week
after he reported wrongdoing to
NSA General Counsel Roger Garber?
Objection, Your Honor.
You don't have to object.
Think of this more as a workplace mediation
than a court of law.
Okay. I...
disagree with the counselor's question.
An answer would violate the State Secrets Act.
I am not asking for any details regarding NSA programs.
My question addresses the personal retaliation
and subsequent demotion
my client suffered under Mr. Froines.
It concerns the content of an official meeting
between Mr. Froines and myself,
which is protected by the State Secrets Act.
I can see how that meeting should be protected.
Sustained. Or, please don't ask that question.
Um, Mr. Froines, have you ever asked my client
to monitor a specific target?
Again, State Secrets, Your Honor.
About NSA surveillance.
Okay, next question.
Mr. Froines,
have you ever assigned my client to a task?
Any task?
Yes.
And was one of these tasks to monitor
the personal communications of Karen Froines, your ex-wife?
That is definitely State Secrets, Your Honor.
Oh, my God, is this how it's gonna be the whole entire time?
The defense is trying an end-run around State Secrets.
That's enough. Thank you.
Find a more fruitful path, counselor.
What is your background?
My background? Irish. Why?
Anything else?
Mr. Agos, anything else?
One moment, Your Honor.
What are you thinking?
Let me try something.
Clarke Hayden, Your Honor.
If the NSA refuses to be forthcoming
about my client's wrongful demotion,
we will be forced to file
a civil rights claim in federal court.
On what grounds?
This was an act of discrimination
against a man from a protected class.
What?
Mr. Dellinger, what nationality are you?
Irish, Dutch and, uh, Cherokee.
Oh, come on. How much Cherokee?
This nation has anti-discrimination laws in place
to protect citizens like my client,
a proud descendant of the Cherokee Nation of... Oklahoma.
This is absurd.
That claim is an obvious pretext that
Mr. Dellinger will surely lose.
Maybe so, but even pretextual cases
become a part of the record.
You know, the public record.
The record open to the public.
Your Honor, we ask for a recess.
Granted.
Alicia Florrick.
Ms. Florrick, my goodness,
you sound different.
I expect to get your secretary.
Oh, no, it's just me, Mr. Canning, at your command.
Well, I'll command, then.
Uh, I was surprised to learn
that you're being sued for $6 million.
Uh, a malpractice suit from when you worked here.
Going through the files, are you?
You'd be surprised what you can find there.
I'd like to make a peace offering.
Lockhart/Gardner & Canning are willing to assume
a portion of that $6 million liability.
In exchange for?
Lessening your firm's Chumhum burden.
Our burden?
I hate to say it,
but Chumhum needs
the resources of a national firm like LG&C.
Mr. Canning...
what do you think of Al-Qaeda?
What do I think of Al-Qaeda?
Yes.
They're a terrorist organization. Why?
I just wanted to know what Louis Canning thought.
Hey, uh, I just got five alerts on one call.
Who is it?
Someone new.
Louis Canning talking to Alicia.
What do I think of NSA?
I don't know. I've always been kind of a libertarian.
强调个人主义 理性的利己主义 彻底自由放任的资本主义
Ah, Ayn Rand and all that?
She's an underappreciated writer. So, no, I...
Well, thank you for calling me back, Senator.
No problem, Peter.
I got to keep my golfing buddy happy.
Tell me I'm not being tapped and I'll be happy.
Hey, look, I have a direct line to the offices in Illinois,
and I talked to all the people out there,
and they say you're in the clear.
Oh, good, I'm relieved.
I was a little, uh, I was a little worried there.
Hey, the new normal makes us all nervous. But you're good,
and so is your wife.
Well, thank you again.
Mm-hmm. Listen, um...
about that Westgate construction site
that we were talking about on the eighth hole,
there are a few things I wanted to settle.
A few... Uh, what? Listen, Peter, I...
The Westgate construction site.
Remember, we agreed to delay discussion on compensation?
I thought we should talk about that now.
No, no, no, I-I don't think...
Look, I'm coming out there in a few weeks.
Why don't we discuss it then, okay?
No, no, no, I think now's a better time for me.
I think we agreed to an equal split,
unless you've changed your mind.
Uh, Peter, that was just between you and me.
And it is between you and me...
now... on the phone.
No, I mean, it is...
How is the Westgate district doing for you?
Peter, stop.
For me, it's...
You've made your point.
No, my point is I want them to stop
listening to me and my office.
I want them to stop listening to my wife's law office.
For the next five months,
I'm going to call my wife's office
twice a week to discuss the Westgate construction site.
So if you don't want to be in the papers,
I would strongly suggest that you use
your considerable influence with the NSA
to take us off any lists that we are on.
Do you understand me?
Bill, do you understand me?
It's this guy Froines. Chuck Froines
out of the Illinois office.
He's the one driving this.
Get me his contact info.
It won't make a difference calling him.
Let me deal with that. Just get me his contact info.
I am not worthy.
I am not worthy.
Your Honor, my client's home was raided last night
due to the filing of a DOJ crimes report...
A raid that proved fruitful, Your Honor.
We recovered a classified document in his desk drawer.
That wasn't classified. That was a meeting schedule.
Your Honor, I can't be sure,
since I have not been given a copy of this evidence...
Implicit in the word "Classified"
is the idea it can't be distributed.
But it is our understanding the document in question
is a meeting schedule.
That's all. It was not classified
when it was given to Mr. Dellinger or when he took it home.
The NSA retroactively classified it
because the raid failed to produce the evidence
they were hoping to find.
On the contrary, Your Honor, the raid produced
this classified document.
It wasn't classified until 12 hours ago.
This is the exact definition of ex post facto law.
Your Honor, I would like to call our client
to testify to the innocuous contents
of this document.
Objection.
Or... whatever.
I disagree.
The Classified Information Procedures Act
prevents a criminal defendant from disclosing classified information.
Then I would ask Your Honor to review the contents
of the document in camera.
Actually, Your Honor,
you don't have the necessary security clearance
to view the document.
I'm sorry?
You and Mr. Hayden and Mr. Agos
must apply for clearance
and be vetted, if we are to go forward.
I can't look at it?
I'm sorry, sir, but you cannot.
It's a list of meetings and times, Your Honor.
Okay, then. I will apply for security clearance,
as I assume you will as well,
Mr. Hayden, Mr. Agos.
We will, Your Honor.
And when it is granted,
we may proceed.
Kalinda, can you come here for a sec?
Have a seat.
Can I ask you a question?
Do you like working here?
I do.
Because I was looking at your employment record,
and I noticed you chose not to sign the contract.
You just like being a free agent?
Don't like to be tied down?
Yeah.
But you've been here a long time,
so clearly you-you-you like it.
You must be happy,
I mean... certainly we pay you enough.
I am happy.
If I were unhappy, then... I wouldn't be here.
Well, there's a coincidence,
because if I was unhappy,
you wouldn't be here.
You can't work for Diane and work for the firm.
Well, Diane's a managing partner.
Yes, but if you work for her exclusively,
then feed her information that I discuss with you,
then let her pay you...
then we'll sue you
for return of employee compensation.
Hey, try me if you think I won't.
Diane doesn't have the votes.
I have the votes.
You think I'd be here if I didn't?
What do you want, Louis?
I want to know what Diane wants you to do.
Pretend to be close to you.
Find out whether you're pushing her out.
Tell her I'm not.
You, uh... seem happier.
I had a good night's sleep.
Mrs. Florrick.
Now that you've arrived, we can begin.
I assume you've had sufficient time
to consult with Mr. Polmar?
Yes, thank you.
And I have a few questions for you, Mr. Castro.
For me?
Yes.
By all means.
Mr. Castro,
did you ever use the term "GenDen" yourself
in any text or memo to staff?
"GenDen" Meaning "General detention"?
Yes.
No.
It's not part of the culture of my office.
So it's not a term or practice
you yourself use?
That's correct.
Is this a cross-examination of the state's attorney?
It's okay. Happy to answer.
I took the liberty of having some slides loaded.
Mr. Castro,
you sent my client a text
on March 16 of this year that says,
"Is Jeffery Grant G.D.?"
Yes, I can see.
Can you tell the panel
what you meant by this text?
Perhaps you overlooked the fact that you have used the term.
No. "G.D." Is not the term.
I see.
So what did you mean by G.D.?
Is the prosecutor sufficiently prepared
to take the defendant down to first degree?
"Going down""
I see. Thank you for the correction.
No problem.
So in this text,
you write, on April 6,
"I can't wait to G.D. On Batiste.
What fun!"
You were saying,
"I can't wait to go down on Batiste.
What fun"?
No, that's not what I meant.
What I meant was I can't wait to take him down.
By going down on him?
No. That's not...
You-You're misinterpreting my words.
Sir,You used "G.D." To mean "General detention,"
as everyone in this room well knows.
And to act as though Finn Polmar's behavior
is any different from your own
is simple hypocrisy.
No.
You are trying to scapegoat here,
and that is...
Excuse me.
Placing defendants
in general population
was a tactic used by the state's attorney's office
to soften up defendants for a plea bargain.
You know this, Matan.
You used it.
So it is the height of scapegoating
to blame Finn Polmar for this.
And it is almost criminal
to blame him for Jeffrey Grant's actions.
He did what any prosecutor in this room would do.
And you know this.
Well, you woke up.
Didn't you?
Oh, yeah.
It's time to kick some ass.
We know what you're up to, Mr. Canning.
we wanted to thank you.
Will was anxious to expand.
He was aggressive, and the firm purchases
that he didn't tell us about. Left us vulnerable.
Yeah, I bet that was, uh, quite a surprise.
How did you manage to undo the deals?
Well, the firms that Will bought
both represent the third and sixth
largest pharmaceutical companies in the country.
Luckily for us, I represent the largest.
So the clients conflict.
Yeah. Faced with the prospect of firing their biggest clients,
uh, they were both surprisingly amenable
to reconsidering the purchases.
And the sports firm in L.A.?
Well, there's no conflict there.
I don't represent anybody in sports law. Do you?
No.
Well, you do now.
It seemed like a good idea to keep them.
It's a growing field.
Well, it meant a lot to Will.
Thank you.
I'm happy to help.
You know, you two are overthinking this.
This hidden agenda that you keep looking for, th...
there isn't one.
your track record is a...
thing that's hard to...
get past.
That was before.
It was the old days.
I'm your partner now.
I may be a scumbag, but...
Hey, I'm your scumbag.
Froines.
No, you have the wrong number.
Yeah. How'd you get this?
No, I don't have a car for sale.
Froines.
Excuse me, where'd you get this number?
No, I don't have a car...
There's been some mistake.
Is your first name Charles?
Yes.
Are you in Illinois?
Yes.
Are you now a member of any group that advocates
the violent overthrow of the United States government?
No.
Have you ever been contacted by any group
that advocates the violent overthrow
of the United States government?
No.
Administrative leave? Why? What did I do?
Probably nothing.
It's just administrative.
Is this about these calls?
What calls?
Five calls asking about a car.
I don't know anything about them.
Well... let's talk about what you do know.
Nothing.
I'm being pranked, that's all.
Okay.
Let's take the calls one at a time.
Who is... Bilal Al-Dawoodi?
Got some good news for you, Mr. Dellinger.
The government's dropping their case against you.
You can go back to work.
I left you a message on your cell, too.
Call me back on either one.
You know, I knew it wasn't Dell.
No way.
What?
He's not coming back.
How do you know?
Shut up, J.
Hans told me.
Hans?
I thought Hans was the leaker.
What? Where did you get that?
I don't know.
I heard he went to Reykjavik.
Dell?
But he hates the cold.
Iceland has the hottest women of anywhere.
You're thinking of Sweden.
No, Iceland.
It's a known fact.
Bjork is from Iceland.
The Florrick tap is over. Done.
File your summaries and close it down.
We need ears on Gregorio Valencia.
Dearborn, Michigan, 31,
recently married.
Hello.
Nice work.
You'd think the NSA would know better
than to be spying on a governor and his family, but you know...
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Well, since you're here, I thought we'd, uh...
go over a few things.
There is a fund-raising dinner
May 17.
And then there's the July 4 gala.
Uh, what time on the 17th?
Grace is cooking dinner for her class.
It sounds elaborate.
It'll be 6:00.
Okay. I'll see if Owen can stop by.
And then dinner with the Canadian ambassador
on August 10.
And then on September 4,
I have a Democratic Committee fund-raiser
at the Chicago Cultural Center.
All right. Um, the Sunday before August 31,
I have a client dinner with James Paisley and his wife.
Sunday? Yeah, I can be there. The last week of September,
Eli has us scheduled for a profile...
