i don &apos;t need someone piecing this together

dr. lady suit .
any idea when our art crimes agent is heading back to d.c. ?
the bureau travel department has her flying out on friday .
dare i say , our target has shifted .
yeah .
assuming the list is in that briefcase ,
we need to get a look before diana delivers it to her .
i &apos;ll follow .
thanks for coming , jones .
sure , peter . what &apos;s up ?
you know who helen anderson is ?
yeah , executive editor at circumspect .
wrote that killer expose on big oil .
that &apos;s her . take a look at these .
ah , someone &apos;s following her .
someone &apos;s threatening her .
wow . she call us in ?
her boss did .
leland shelton . he owns the magazine .
and the paper i read
and the news channel i watch every morning .
leland &apos;s golf buddies
with the head of the white @-@ collar division ,
so looks like we &apos;re helping out .
got to love country @-@ club politics .
so we &apos;re here to find out if the threat &apos;s
coming from someone she &apos;s digging into .
that , too .
when was the last time you were on protective detail ?
really ?
i &apos;m the one that pulled helen out of the field
and onto the masthead of this magazine .
i appreciate your help .
helen ?
do you have a minute ?
4,320 . that &apos;s how many minutes i have till my deadline .
not now , leland .
oh , this won &apos;t take long .
these are agents burke and jones from the fbi .
what are you doing with these ?
they got them from me . i &apos;m concerned , helen .
and i know where you got them .
melinda !
i told you to throw these out !
she was worried about you .
you &apos;re done . you &apos;re fired . now .
helen .
and don &apos;t interfere with my staff .
ms. anderson , our job is to figure out who made the threat .
could it be related to a current story ?
current story .
this ...
stuck in my door in kabul .
this grenade thrown in my camera bag in chechnya .
this effigy burned outside my door in west virginia .
i write stories that make enemies .
if i share my information with you
and you screw it up ,
it all falls apart .
all these pictures mean is that i &apos;m on the right track .
whoever took these photos knows your routine .
they got close .
all they had to do was pull the trigger .
but they didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m not asking you to drop the piece , helen .
just let them protect you .
you won &apos;t even know i &apos;m there .
oh , really ?
i won &apos;t see your black s.u.v. parked a half a block away
or your wingtips following me down the hallway ?
i don &apos;t need a government shadow .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , gentlemen , i have a deadline .
keep her alive . do whatever you have to do .
i &apos;ll help in any way i can .
so we &apos;re supposed to protect someone
who won &apos;t let us within 100 yards of her .
yup .
sorry about that .
don &apos;t be .
been here a month , and i &apos;ve aged 10 years .
well , good luck to her next assistant .
i love helen anderson .
she &apos;ll take on wall street , big oil .
she &apos;s fearless .
great , because we &apos;re sending you into the magazine
to keep her safe .
we can investigate the threats ,
but we can &apos;t interfere with her story .
so i need you to keep an eye on any leads
that you might see while you &apos;re there .
got it .
one other thing .
helen refuses fbi protection ,
so she can &apos;t know that that &apos;s why you &apos;re there .
how &apos;s that gonna work ?
jones ?
well , how many words can you type per minute ?
so i &apos;ll be an undercover bodyguard / assistant .
as in dry @-@ cleaning and dog @-@ walking ?
we made you a bulletproof resume--
graduate of helen &apos;s alma mater , impeccable work experience .
now all you need to do is nail the interview .
i have to interview ?
when your dad worked at the embassy in england ,
you had a british nanny , right ?
she was a regular mary poppins . why ?
so you got the accent down .
here . just brush up on this .
a dialect ? are you joking ?
no . helen lived in northern england
when she wrote for the economist .
she has a soft spot for manchester .
it may give you an edge over the other candidates .
fine . anything else ?
mm ... no .
working for a pulitzer prize winner .
how great is that ?
yeah , yeah . uh , nice offices .
a juicer .
juicer . juicer &apos;s awesome .
what &apos;s with the hard sell ?
helen &apos;s ... driven .
driven &apos;s good .
she &apos;s a little ... intense .
intense ?
she puts the &quot; hell &quot; in &quot; helen . &quot;
in order to protect her , you can &apos;t get fired .
she &apos;s gonna keep you on a tight leash ,
ask you to do things that are way beneath you .
for the length of your assignment ,
your life is not your own .
yeah .
so , i &apos;ll be at the absolute beck and call of my tough new boss .
what &apos;s funny ?
nothing . no .
if you ever need any advice ...
it &apos;s me . sorry . snuck out while you were sleeping .
oh , i heard you .
morning .
morning .
you know , if you &apos;d stayed over , i &apos;d have made you coffee .
i had an early client call ,
which is kind of why i &apos;m here .
i need--
help ?
advice .
i &apos;m working a recovery ,
and i &apos;m up against a tech 98 alarm system .
full video , remote monitoring .
can i beat it ?
yeah .
you need to get to the control panel and take out the wi @-@ fi .
you have bolt cutters ?
small , medium , and large ... mm .
... but that &apos;s assuming i can dodge the guards .
well , you find a partner ,
you could run a wally burns .
what &apos;s a wally burns ?
one person distracts while the other gains access .
oh . you think i could go it alone
with a stun gun and a d.o.d.-grade router ?
normal people don &apos;t talk about this before work .
no , they don &apos;t . we can try normal .
okay .
yeah , let &apos;s try it .
great . sweetie ?
yes , darling ?
did you take out the garbage ?
honey , i shredded the garbage .
you know the feds love to rummage .
they &apos;re not the only ones .
you know , i once tracked a rothko to the hamptons
using a jitney receipt .
okay , that did not work .
um ... all right , how &apos;s this for normal ?
we are invited to my co @-@ worker &apos;s house for a dinner party .
i will whip up some canapes .
you &apos;re being serious ?
diana &apos;s girlfriend thought it might be fun .
yeah . yeah , i think so , too .
what &apos;s behind that tech 98 ?
i can &apos;t tell you .
what are you doing today ?
helping peter find out who &apos;s threatening to kill a public figure
while diana goes undercover as her assistant .
same old , same old ?
who is it ?
can &apos;t tell you .
you can &apos;t name the parent company of this magazine ,
yet you want to work with me , covering the world of finance ?
go . dawson diana .
shelton global media &apos;s the parent company for this magazine .
leland shelton is the founder , chairman , and c.e.o.
where are you from ?
didsbury , in manchester .
i lived in manchester for a year
when i wrote for the economist .
i know .
so , why do you want this job ?
i &apos;ve followed you since you were a foreign correspondent
for the times .
your interview with the secretary of state
was the best thing i read last year .
you &apos;re overqualified and too old .
that means you can go .
little miss . headband out there ?
she won &apos;t last a week .
because she doesn &apos;t know who she is
or where she wants to be .
i do . i want to work for you .
and your piece in last month &apos;s issue --
that arms dealer had corporate backing .
you didn &apos;t go for the throat .
considering the geopolitics involved ,
your conclusion was my intention .
you start now .
your job is to take care of everything in my life
so that i don &apos;t have to think about living it .
your first task -- get rid of the girls out there .
thank you .
ever talk to me like that to me again ,
and you &apos;ll find out what it feels like
when i go for the throat .
diana &apos;s in .
nice .
she picked up two clues that might point us
to the threats against helen anderson--
two names-- p. sullivan and prager &amp; vaughn .
my buddy at the fda gave us his files on p &amp; v.
pharmaceuticals -- multilevel company ,
probably responsible for a third of the stuff
in your medicine cabinet .
oh . product recalls , rumors of bad manufacturing .
not sure i &apos;d trust these guys to make me feel better .
paul sullivan is the head of new @-@ product development .
he was called in to clean up
p &amp; v &apos;s most recent cold @-@ medicine recall .
he pulled the company stock back from the ledge .
if helen &apos;s investigating him ,
there could be a problem with one of their new products .
with his track record ,
sullivan might have a lot to hide .
yeah , or a lot to lose .
by the time p &amp; v puts a drug on the market ,
they &apos;ve invested a billion dollars in it .
that much at stake , someone might kill to keep a secret .
neal , let &apos;s go talk to sullivan .
peter , we start flashing badges at p &amp; v ,
we &apos;re gonna crash helen &apos;s story .
depends on which badges we flash .
ted brown , fda . we &apos;re looking for mr. sullivan .
don &apos;t bother checking . i &apos;m not on his calendar .
he &apos;s unavailable , sir . you can &apos;t go up there .
i &apos;m calling mr. sullivan .
fda .
thought i was the only one
who could impersonate federal agents .
i &apos;m authorized to go undercover . there &apos;s a difference .
and the glasses ?
i use them to make a point .
fda . looking for paul sullivan .
paul sullivan ?
got a plan to go with that badge ?
we &apos;re flushing , like with quail .
i fire off shots ,
and then you keep an eye out for a reaction .
got it .
excuse me .
fda !
fda !
put it away . go .
i &apos;m looking for paul sullivan .
i &apos;m paul sullivan .
please .
i &apos;ve asked my counsel , mr. carter , to sit in .
what can we help you with , mr. brown ?
we met with the fda two weeks ago .
that was a scheduled meeting .
today you thought you &apos;d surprise us ?
surprise .
who &apos;s this ?
my associate .
hey , blake , who &apos;s at extension
2614 at prager &amp; vaughn ?
company directory has her listed
as amy sawyer , r &amp; d.
sawyer .
she lives at ... 4258 west 79th street .
she &apos;s cute .
yes , she is .
unmarried . no dependents .
unless you count sir boots barkley .
you got her cellphone ?
yeah .
this company has had a bad run under your watch .
it &apos;s my personal mission
to make sure you &apos;ve cleaned up your practices .
hello ?
yes , ms. sawyer ? i live in 6a .
i found your dog , boots , in the hallway .
boots ? how did he get out ?
i have no idea . but i got to get to work .
can you please come and pick him up ?
yeah , i &apos;m on my way .
should we start with offshore marketing or recalls ?
i need to take this .
uh , will you be all right without me ?
we &apos;ll be fine .
gentlemen , if you &apos;d take a look at this number right here .
that one puzzles me .
what &apos;s confusing , mr. brown ?
the fda operates under the information we have .
your company &apos;s not known for its transparency .
mr. brown , despite what you &apos;re insinuating ,
we &apos;re in the business of helping people .
p &amp; v &apos;s the reason you &apos;re gonna live long enough
to find yourself browsing the aisles for adult diapers .
and you &apos;ll thank us for it .
okay .
nice speech .
i want q.c. reports , stage @-@ four clinical trials ,
and r &amp; d for all products launched
within the last six months --
all of it -- today .
we &apos;ll ship it over .
are we done here ? i got a thing .
we &apos;re done .
you got me a blank sheet of paper ?
most high @-@ quality paper stock can be split in two .
here .
see ?
yeah . let me try that .
yeah . you need the right touch .
a little fingerprint powder .
and there you go .
they redacted the drug after the document was printed .
that &apos;s why i had to get the original .
can you tell who signed the report ?
no , i couldn &apos;t make it out on the original , either .
but the drug name is clear .
never heard of zybax .
good thing you demanded all that product information .
yeah .
need the right touch .
where &apos;s the research i asked you for ?
i &apos;m almost finished .
well , you said for me to stay at my desk .
would you like me to make copies or answer the phone ?
yes .
there &apos;s a stain . get it out .
set up dinner with salman rushdie tonight .
it &apos;s 1 : 00 . vitamins !
i &apos;ve had malaria twice .
are you trying to undermine my immune system ?
copies . now .
helen anderson &apos;s office .
one moment .
it &apos;s the financial analyst from channel nine .
put him through .
helen anderson &apos;s office .
i dialed your fbi phone .
i forwarded helen &apos;s calls to my cell .
oh . good .
hey , the accent sounds pretty realistic .
how &apos;s it going over there ?
i have so many paper cuts , i need a blood transfusion .
it is impossible to remove
wheat grass from chanel .
she made me go to her brownstone to give prozac to her parrot .
how was that ?
it shrieked at me about deadlines .
is that a personal call ?
document storage . the files you asked for .
was that her or the parrot ?
i don &apos;t know how long i can do this .
she wants to have dinner with salman rushdie tonight .
how am i supposed to f--
wait , you can find salman rushdie .
oh , i &apos;d have to pull some strings .
mail .
why isn &apos;t my mail open ?
i see why she gets so many death threats .
peter .
what is it ?
they got inside helen &apos;s place .
the fbi is sweeping my apartment now .
charlie &apos;s on the way to his dad &apos;s ,
and he &apos;ll stay there until things settle down .
have you arranged for security ?
building and charlie &apos;s school .
would you like me to book you into a hotel for tonight ?
i spent years sleeping in tents and bombed @-@ out hotels .
one of the perks of this job is
frette sheets in my own home .
they can &apos;t intimidate me with this crap .
that was evidence .
then tape it back together . i have to make a call .
i &apos;ll dial you in . should i take notes ?
i &apos;ll dial myself in . go do your job .
they got into my home .
this is getting dangerous .
if we want to stop this , i need more .
you &apos;re right .
people are dying .
i &apos;ll give you what i have .
i &apos;m ready to meet .
good . where ?
the place you suggested . 8 : 00 p.m.
let &apos;s take them down .
what we have here is a cost @-@ benefit analysis
for the recall of a drug named zybax .
do we have anything on zybax ?
we &apos;ve got everything on zybax .
it &apos;s a new antibiotic designed
to combat drug @-@ resistant infections .
sounds like the next big thing .
marketing report says
they rolled it out in new york , boston , and philly .
they &apos;re going national this month .
passed clinical trials , got fda approval .
looks perfect on paper .
p &amp; v wanted to know how much it would cost
to take this drug off the market .
we need to find out why .
diana . what &apos;s going on ?
helen has a source at p &amp; v.
peter , this is serious .
he mentioned people are dying over this .
they set up a meet .
where ? we can secure the location .
i didn &apos;t get an address .
i want you there .
it &apos;s not a personal call .
lovely .
ms. anderson &apos;s looking forward
to seeing mr. rushdie tonight .
cancel the dinner . tell my driver he can take the night off .
i &apos;ll take a taxi home . and this doesn &apos;t fill itself .
coffee .
you &apos;re meeting with a source tonight , aren &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re asking a wildly inappropriate question .
i know how important that dinner was to you .
and i know you &apos;d only take a taxi
if you didn &apos;t want anyone to know where you were going .
and this is your third cup of coffee .
you &apos;re gearing up for a meeting .
you should take me with you . i can help .
i &apos;ll tell you how you can help me .
it &apos;s my child &apos;s 6th birthday .
it &apos;s not on your calendar .
that &apos;s why i have a pulitzer
and not a &quot; mommy of the year &quot; mug .
now , my last assistant
arranged for charlie &apos;s party at my apartment ,
which is currently a crime scene .
okay . when is the party ?
today at 4 : 00 .
that &apos;s why i need you to move everything --
the cake , the decorations , everything .
and you need to call all the guests
and tell them that i &apos;m sorry that i &apos;m not there .
if this threat &apos;s real and i went ,
i would be putting charlie and all the children in danger .
new party . got it .
oh , damn .
i fired melinda before she could get charlie &apos;s gift .
there &apos;s a robot that he loves .
she wrote it down somewhere .
and i want new locks , the kind the white house uses .
if i get all this done ,
can i come with you to meet the source ?
finish it all , and i &apos;ll let you drive me .
oh , and make sure you translate
the lisbon communique into english by 6 : 00 .
peter , if you want me there
when helen meets the source , i &apos;m gonna need some help .
i &apos;m e @-@ mailing you a list .
listen up .
diana needs to be within 20 yards of helen at all times ,
so we &apos;re gonna lend a hand .
first up , we need a lock for a residential door --
ultra @-@ secure , state of the art .
i got a guy .
he &apos;ll even do the road work for you .
mozzie ?
i want the master key .
all right , who here speaks portuguese ?
good . you get to translate a communiqu ?
what &apos;s a supaiku @-@ bot ?
i don &apos;t know . some kind of robot hedgehog toy .
i &apos;ll get that .
jones , you &apos;re gonna run point and handle decorations .
so , streamers and a couple balloons ?
no . no , no , no .
no ?
no . no . we are in way over our heads , aren &apos;t we ?
yeah .
we need a ringer .
okay , so the sugar @-@ free cake ,
the nut @-@ free cake , and the dairy @-@ free cake --
they go on that table over there .
got the goodie bags -- table over there by the cactus .
okay , we &apos;ve got the cowboy hats and the cute little aliens .
we &apos;re gonna put those out on the tables over here .
hey , jones .
hey !
cowboys in space ?
i want you to plan my birthday party .
do you want a moon bounce , as well ?
i want to be a cowboy .
oh , well , there you go , jones .
giddy up .
nice .
the zhviegel millenium ?
i won &apos;t even need my picks . i &apos;ll just bump it .
but with my modifications ,
it is unlike any other zhviegel on the market .
tension &apos;s unreadable . i &apos;m impressed .
that lock is so complex , it is only rivaled by my mind .
oh , i used the hook . it was tough , though .
if you added another pin --
ah , a bluff inside the cylinder . yeah .
this and a wedge under the door ,
and helen anderson &apos;s townhouse
will be more secure than fort knox .
which , as we know , has its own weaknesses .
speaking of , where &apos;s diana &apos;s briefcase ?
oh , she took it back to the sheagle &apos;s nest .
we &apos;ve only got two days to get it .
don &apos;t worry , moz .
i &apos;ll cook something up .
hey .
heard you guys got a shipment .
special agent peter burke , fbi .
i &apos;m commandeering a supaiku @-@ bot .
what ?
the party was a hit .
your jacket &apos;s clean , research is categorized and collated ,
and i canceled the rushdie dinner .
what about --
30 wheat @-@ grass smoothie .
keys to your new locks
and the translation of the lisbon communique .
i &apos;m driving .
what are you doing ?
i thought i was coming with you .
no . this is the first time i &apos;m meeting the source .
i said you could drive me . that &apos;s as far as you get .
there he is .
you want to do what i do ,
you need guts , good instincts , and patience .
work on that .
we got to make this quick .
all right .
there &apos;s a whistle @-@ blower protection . tell me ...
this didn &apos;t come from me .
we both know what happens when ...
helen !
helen !
wait !
ugh ! why did you do that ? you scared my source !
someone followed you . look .
he gave me this flash drive .
all right .
the source didn &apos;t give helen a name .
at least , that &apos;s what she told me .
i dropped her home .
you want me to double back for a stakeout ?
no need .
we &apos;ve got an unmarked car on her house .
good work today . get some rest .
if you insist . good night , peter .
what smells so g--
hey !
hi , honey .
people always say they &apos;re gonna get together ,
and they never do , so i called christie .
and here we are .
here we are .
neal , this risotto &apos;s delicious . i need one more bite .
contraband cheese .
caffrey , i should fine you and confiscate the dairy .
hey , don &apos;t take your day with helen out on me .
oh , don &apos;t get me started .
actually , i could use your help with this .
her source gave her a flash drive
with these numbers on it and no explanation .
oh . patent i.d.s , formula files ?
nope . they don &apos;t correspond with zybax or any p &amp; v product .
maybe samples .
i could check in the hospital pharmacy tomorrow .
thank you .
how about you , sara ? what do you do ?
she is in insurance .
oh , the kind that sends me mountains of paperwork ?
no . no , no .
um , but if your rodin goes missing , please call me .
oh , insurance recovery .
yes .
wait a minute .
that means that --
that &apos;s right . he steals &apos; em . she gets &apos; em back .
wow . i &apos;ve got to know how you both met .
she has been after me for a long time .
oh , my god !
he stole a raphael .
conjecture , your honor .
and i pursued .
and i haven &apos;t forgotten about the raphael .
we &apos;re boring .
anyway , how about you two ? how &apos;d you two meet ?
it &apos;s a really cute story .
oh , they don &apos;t want to hear it .
i want to hear it .
i &apos;m good . - we --
i &apos;ll just be -- no , i &apos;m good . i &apos;m just gonna ...
you know , you are just like my friend wally burns .
it took him forever to tell me how he met his wife .
you remember wally , right ? i told you about him .
yeah , i remember wally .
um , dinner @-@ party rules .
you guys cooked , so diana and i -- get dessert .
yes . and more wine .
thank you so much .
thank you .
i have to tell you , i love your place .
oh , thanks .
so , you and diana -- come on .
you were her doctor ? krav maga ?
i &apos;m not gonna tell you .
all right , fine . how was dinner the other night ?
oh , it was great .
when i eat at babbo ,
i like to go to this bar around the corner after --
simone &apos;s .
i love simone &apos;s .
we came straight home . we both had work to do .
oh . laptops in bed ? sounds romantic .
very -- i researched stents ,
and di finished up for a morning meeting .
a meeting before her day with helen ?
sounds like a busy day .
she had to drop something off .
you told him , didn &apos;t you ?
told me what ?
yeah , nice try , caffrey . how we met .
i didn &apos;t tell him .
i thought it was cute .
there &apos;s nothing cute about pottery class .
yes ! pottery class !
so much better than i ever could have imagined .
and that would have explained ...
yeah , well , i made that .
oh , uh , i mean , i think that it &apos;s lovely .
ditto .
oh , yeah . all right , let &apos;s get all the &quot; ghost &quot; jokes
out of the way -- hum &quot; unchained melody , &quot;
slide a penny up the wall .
uh @-@ huh . it &apos;s supposed to be round , right ?
it &apos;s absolutely hideous .
yes .
yeah .
so , why did we run a wally burns on diana &apos;s girlfriend ?
oh , i can &apos;t tell you .
oh . okay .
hold on .
you don &apos;t give me details about your job .
yeah . i could probably live with a secret or two .
i could handle that .
yeah ?
neal . did you get it ?
oh . get a room !
we are in a room .
my room .
that hurts .
next time i make a lock ,
i guess it should be for &quot; your &quot; door .
or there is this thing called knocking .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
you &apos;re leaving ?
mood sufficiently killed .
call me later . or come over .
sure .
not you .
seriously , just put a sock on the doorknob .
yeah .
any leads on the list ?
diana met with agent matthews yesterday .
she gave her the list .
ah , fair melissa .
she &apos;s an easier mark than badass berrigan .
you realize that list is on lockdown in her hotel room .
yeah , we just rip out a page from our own playbook .
we know when melissa is heading out of town .
we swap the briefcases when she leaves for the airport .
difficulties mastered are opportunities won .
some of us have work in the morning .
morning .
christie called .
oh . she run the numbers through the hospital pharmacy ?
she wanted me to ask you if and you and sara
want to play doubles next weekend .
yeah , caffrey , when you gonna cook me dinner ?
i like risotto .
look at the two of you , trying to be funny .
don &apos;t we have a case to work ?
we do .
turns out the numbers the source gave helen
match serial numbers of the sample packs of zybax
in the hospital database .
but here &apos;s the thing .
none of the samples are stocked in the pharmacies .
p &amp; v reps came in and swapped them out .
swapped them for what ?
zybax .
same drug , different packaging ,
different serial number .
so what if sullivan found out about a bad batch
and did an undercover recall ?
he traded dirty samples for clean ones .
right .
to cover their tracks , p &amp; v said it was new packaging .
but even if the reps cleared out
all the doctors &apos; offices and hospitals ,
there &apos;s no way they got it all back .
this is what helen &apos;s source meant .
there are people out there taking bad zybax .
it could kill them .
but all of this is just a theory .
p &amp; v will bury us in a lawsuit unless we have proof .
then let &apos;s get proof .
diana !
i &apos;ll be done fact @-@ checking in five .
my source just e @-@ mailed me .
he &apos;s got my smoking gun .
what is it ?
a memo .
but after what happened at the park ,
he &apos;s afraid to move it out of the office .
he &apos;s worried they &apos;re going to search him .
where does that leave you ?
walking into a lion &apos;s den of corner offices and corporate hubris .
he &apos;s going to guide me to it .
you &apos;re supposed to just show up at p &amp; v and get the memo ?
no , we are .
there &apos;s a launch party for zybax this afternoon .
really ?
don &apos;t make me regret this .
according to the source ,
the memo authorizes zybax be repackaged
as part of a covert recall .
it &apos;s signed by the head of new products .
paul sullivan . we get the memo , we get him .
you know , helen never invited an assistant anywhere .
this is like an unofficial promotion .
you realize you don &apos;t actually work for her .
oh , but i do .
well , congratulations on your unofficial promotion .
stay close to helen . be careful .
whoever had her in their sights is still out there .
i won &apos;t let anything happen to helen .
oh , i know you &apos;ll take care of her .
i &apos;m worried about you .
don &apos;t be .
i &apos;m gonna walk out of the front door of p &amp; v
with everything we need to take them down .
my gut &apos;s bothering me .
maybe you need some zybax .
think i &apos;ll pass .
by now , helen &apos;s figured out
the serial numbers are for the samples of zybax .
she &apos;s on her way to get the memo .
she strikes me as the type of person
who will do whatever it takes to get what she needs .
that &apos;s what &apos;s bothering me .
sullivan knows she &apos;s looking into p &amp; v.
and whatever he &apos;s hiding , she &apos;s gonna come after it .
if a p &amp; v employee knows about the zybax cover @-@ up ,
starts feeding helen intel ...
she picks up the trail , sullivan follows her
all the way to the source .
if the meet happens at the launch party ,
the source could be exposed .
hey , guys , we did some further work
on that redacted document
and were able to identify the signature at the bottom .
we just found our source . casey mendell .
head of r &amp; d. let &apos;s go talk to him .
jones , call diana . let her know .
the source thinks i &apos;m alone .
you &apos;re here to observe . keep your distance .
i &apos;ll be at the bar .
yeah .
i have eyes on helen .
i got a look at the guest list .
casey mendell is not at this party .
he &apos;s not in his office . we &apos;re on our way to his house .
that &apos;s mendell &apos;s building .
hey , fbi . what &apos;s going on here ?
lady got home from work ,
found her husband on the floor , called us .
it was too late . must &apos;ve died this morning .
casey mendell ?
yeah .
memo &apos;s in room 2642 on the desk .
hi . are you one of our new sales reps ?
no .
can i get you a drink ?
no .
it &apos;s a setup . mendell &apos;s dead .
whoever contacted helen pretended to be her source .
excuse me .
damn it , peter . helen &apos;s gone .
we &apos;re on our way .
get out of my way .
it &apos;s loud out there .
don &apos;t bother screaming .
an undetectable drug ?
i die quickly ,
you move my body and send a team
to wipe my computers and destroy my files .
something like that .
drop it , or i &apos;ll put a bullet in each kneecap .
i promise i &apos;m faster .
down .
damn it .
get the handcuffs out of my purse .
who are you ?
agent diana berrigan , fbi .
damn right , i &apos;m overqualified .
talked to my buddy at the fda .
turns out the bad zybax causes brain hemorrhages
if taken with certain medications .
p &amp; v figured they &apos;d shut down mendell and helen ,
then roll the dice on any medication still out there .
settling lawsuits would &apos;ve been cheaper than a recall .
mm . well , at least the drug &apos;s off the market ,
and we &apos;ve got carter and sullivan
on conspiracy to commit murder .
any chance of getting that case report
by the end of the day ?
if i can get it to you by lunch ,
can i go to that tech conference in miami ?
by lunch ? sure .
miami &apos;s gonna feel so good in november .
you know , just the other day , i wondered ,
&quot; where have all the boy scouts gone ? &quot;
there are some girl scouts here , too .
diana , a woman like you shouldn &apos;t be surrounded
by florescent lights and old spice .
you are the best assistant i have ever had .
i want you back .
whatever they pay you here , i will pay more than double .
i don &apos;t need a byline .
in my interview , i told you i knew who i was
and where i wanted to be .
that &apos;s right here .
i dedicated my article to casey mendell .
but i wouldn &apos;t be standing here if it weren &apos;t for you .
you should hire your old assistant back .
she &apos;s the one who saved your life .
i have a deadline .
goodbye , helen .
it &apos;s amazing .
the love inside .
you take it with you .
come on . who am i ?
you in danger , boy .
&quot; ghost &quot; quotes ? ooh .
neal , if you know how diana and christie met ,
you are officially part of the family .
caffrey was at my place ,
but there was nothing for him to find .
i talked with agent matthews .
the list has never been out of her sight .
so it &apos;s safe ?
yeah .
i made sure it stays that way .
neal , we got a problem !
you at the airport ?
of course .
i said i &apos;d follow melissa ,
and i did , all the way to the airport .
she took an earlier flight !
you &apos;re saying the list is gone ?
i &apos;m watching it take off right now .
all right , take a breath , moz .
breath ? the list is on its way to d.c. !
neal , how did this happen ? !
neal ... you coming ?
