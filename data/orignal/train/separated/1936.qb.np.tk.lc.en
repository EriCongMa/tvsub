&quot; all i could do was cry &quot;
there &apos;s a thing we say when someone dies .
we say it to the patient &apos;s family .
there are on @-@ call rooms for that .
we say , &quot; i &apos;m sorry for your loss . &quot;
with type ii , we &apos;re dealing with low birth weight ,
underdeveloped lungs , swallowing problems ,
respiratory problems .
if carried to term , type ii infants typically die
within a few hours of delivery , sometimes days .
your baby &apos;s also at high risk for intrauterine fracturing .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
um , did you say intrauterine ?
yes .
my b--
my baby &apos;s bones are breaking inside of my belly ?
the place he &apos;s supposed to be safe ,
his -- his bones are breaking .
no , i just -- um , c @-@ can he feel it ?
his bones breaking ?
i mean , he can feel it , right ?
so , he &apos;s in -- he &apos;s in pain .
again , i am so sorry .
it &apos;s a pat little phrase , and an empty one .
clear !
it doesn &apos;t begin to cover
what &apos;s actually happening to them .
clear .
it lets us empathize without forcing us
to feel their devastation ourselves .
it protects us ...
time of death ...
... from feeling that pain .
that dark , sinking , relentless pain --
the kind that can eat you alive .
and every day , i thank god for that .
i thought they went home .
they wanted to talk some more .
i &apos;m not sure it helped .
why didn &apos;t you call me ?
i mean , i can help them .
they need someone who knows them
and who cares about them and who can make it --
who can make it what ?
nice .
i want to make it as nice for them as it can be .
and you &apos;re not nice .
you really care about them , don &apos;t you ?
yeah , i do . they &apos;re my friends .
and that right there
is why you have no business in that room .
there &apos;s only one set of feelings that matters here ,
and it &apos;s not yours .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna help them , but it isn &apos;t you .
april kepner is no longer your patient .
excuse me .
there &apos;s no way ,
no way for me to do what i need to do ...
april ...
... and what i @-@ i believe that i should do .
there is a way , sweetheart .
there &apos;s always a way .
now , here &apos;s what we &apos;ll do .
you will choose a day .
soon .
set it aside and arrange to be induced .
and you &apos;ll give birth to your beautiful little boy .
and you &apos;ll give him a name
and have him baptized right then and there .
then you &apos;re gonna get to hold that baby .
and you &apos;ll pray for him and sing to him .
you &apos;re gonna look at him .
you &apos;re gonna look at him
and memorize every little detail of his face .
and you will do that as long as he lives .
you will do that until god takes him .
that &apos;s how you will do this .
we can do that .
can you do that for me ?
oh , of course i &apos;ll do that for you .
i &apos;ll do that for you and him and us .
okay ?
okay .
so , i &apos;ll just ...
i &apos;ll just hold him until god takes him .
that sounds lovely .
maybe god won &apos;t take him .
maybe -- maybe there will be a miracle .
okay .
i &apos;ll just pray for a miracle .
okay ?
okay .
okay .
okay .
lord --
bailey !
grey ! what ? !
sorry . i have a favor to ask .
i &apos;m on call this weekend . can you take it ?
why ? what do you need to do ?
i want to go see derek .
i don &apos;t really want to talk about it in here .
no , i can &apos;t .
little tuck is with his father ,
and ben and i have the weekend to ourselves .
which is exactly why i &apos;m asking --
then you know exactly why i &apos;m saying no .
lord --
oh , well , crap .
you know what i was gonna say .
somebody get me an o.r. , please ?
move beds three and four to the burn center .
coming through !
it &apos;s a mess in here .
yeah , kepner &apos;s out .
things don &apos;t run right without her .
we have a gsw in five .
bailey , can you take that ?
yeah , b- b @-@ but how are they -- kepner and avery ?
no word .
i &apos;m admitting that femur break in bed six .
bed five needs a rt consult . - okay , hold on . hold on , um --
okay , well , where &apos;s kepner ? i can just tell her .
uh , she and avery are out today .
oh , god , today ?
okay , what are we gonna do for them ?
flowers ? no , that &apos;s weird .
yeah , no , w @-@ what else can we do for them ?
do for who ?
kepler and avery .
oh , god , what do you do ?
flowers ?
vetoed .
food ?
who cooks ?
nobody cooks .
oh , kepner cooks .
we could do a fruit basket ?
oh , stop .
we could all sign a card .
okay , i &apos;m stopping .
i lit a candle in the chapel .
it made me feel better .
you can all just , um , give them privacy .
that &apos;s all they &apos;re gonna want .
uh , shepherd .
uh , you said you wanted
to go over dr. herman &apos;s tumor plan .
you want to get lunch ?
uh ... i can &apos;t .
i @-@ i got to push it .
drew hawkins ,
in for a surgical resection of a butterfly glioma .
can you see the light even a little ?
nope . it &apos;s just black .
total blindness now for about a month .
but i can still smell .
what is that , lilac perfume ?
lavender shampoo .
and why has drew gone blind ?
the blindness in both eyes
is caused by a lesion in the optic radiation .
nailed it , dr. lavender .
oh , can we show her the trick ?
sure .
catch !
pretty fly for a blind guy , right ?
how ?
drew has cortical blindness .
his eyes still see , but only the subconscious part
of his brain receives the signals .
your subconscious saw the pen .
once i decompress the tumor ,
i may be able to free up the visual cortex ,
possibly restoring your sight .
and maybe i &apos;ll see again ?
drew , we talked about this .
i am gonna try for total resection ,
but at the very least , i will buy you time .
i know , i know , but there &apos;s a chance ?
there &apos;s a chance .
what do you have for me ?
brenda bonaman , 44 .
isolated shotgun wound to the neck .
she has right shoulder dislocation status
post mechanical fall .
who shot her ?
my husband .
your husband ?
not like that ! not on purpose !
it was an accident .
was it , howard ?
was it an accident ?
did you confuse me with a moose ?
brenda , if i wanted to shoot you , i &apos;d have done it in the woods .
you &apos;d still be out there .
okay , l @-@ let &apos;s calm it down .
let &apos;s get her to trauma one now .
shoulder dislocation .
the acromion &apos;s fractured .
i &apos;m gonna need to do a reduction under anesthesia .
might as well wait . she &apos;s got a zone two injury .
wounds from the cricoid to the mandible .
she &apos;s got to go straight to the o. r.
oh , god . brenda , i &apos;m sorry .
howard , shut up .
why were we pointing a shotgun at our wife today ?
i was putting it away , and it --
we had just come back from duck hunting .
duck hunting -- his big idea of an adventure .
it was fun ! you had --
i wanted to go to belize .
well , it rains in belize , too .
i don &apos;t get shot in belize !
brenda , what &apos;s hurting ?
everything hurts !
doctor , here &apos;s the x @-@ ray .
okay .
okay , yeah , it &apos;s this pellet .
it &apos;s close to the major blood vessels .
and we &apos;ll know for sure once we open her up .
come on , let &apos;s go .
oh , god !
howard -- - baby .
brenda , honey , i &apos;m here . i &apos;m sorry .
all right , we got to go . sir , could you move , please ?
warren , follow up on her labs .
and have them rushed quick .
i need them upstairs .
is she -- what is happening to her ? !
listen , you can wait right over there , okay ?
and , listen , as --
as soon as we know something , we &apos;ll come get you .
we are gonna take very good care of her .
all right .
um ... what do i do with this ?
uh , that &apos;s a patient &apos;s personals release .
but , uh , you take it to the clerk .
but first , take these up to the lab .
tell them to rush the results . you got it ?
what time did you come to bed last night ?
i didn &apos;t until this morning .
ugh , my palms are so sweaty .
hi .
so , i just need a few signatures before we begin .
um , so , what exactly happens after this ?
how do we get started ?
well , uh , after we &apos;re done here ,
i will take you to your room .
i &apos;ll give you the medication that starts dilation ,
then the pitocin .
and your body will know what to do from there .
so , this is for the birth certificate .
have you decided on a name ?
uh , we are still working on that .
we &apos;re ï£µ .
okay , well , you can just sign now
and we &apos;ll fill in the rest later .
uh , these are the consent forms .
i think we signed those .
not these .
uh , what we &apos;re doing today is an induction termination .
you &apos;re at 24 weeks , so , technically ,
we could intervene to keep the baby alive
after the delivery .
and these are just forms
to make it official that ... you don &apos;t .
i need both signatures .
what are those other forms ?
uh ...
these are , um ... for the death certificate .
really ?
can we not ... yet ?
it &apos;s better
to get all of the paperwork out of the way ,
and then you never have to worry about it again .
do you need a minute ?
yes , please .
all i wanted was to start a family with you .
oh , i know .
i know .
this isn &apos;t fair .
none of this is fair .
you &apos;re right . i know .
i don &apos;t care what she says .
i &apos;m not signing these .
i didn &apos;t even know this place was here .
shh .
okay , let &apos;s go .
shh .
i found it first --
their baby &apos;s problem .
i know , but that isn &apos;t --
i wished horrible things for them , jo .
jackson left me for her ,
and i wished them misery and fights and breakups .
i mean , i &apos;d see them
sitting together in the cafeteria ,
and i &apos;d wish them food poisoning .
then i found this .
you would never have wished them this .
you know that .
if you hadn &apos;t found that , somebody else would have
it wouldn &apos;t have changed anything .
it &apos;s not on you .
if anything , it just means that you &apos;re a good doctor .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna go make a blind man see .
zola &apos;s gonna push for cookies after dinner .
don &apos;t fall for it .
and bailey &apos;s blanket is in the dryer .
yeah , why don &apos;t you tell this to jo ?
she &apos;s gonna be doing it .
what ?
you offered .
i didn &apos;t offer . jo did .
i &apos;m on call all weekend .
what &apos;s going on ?
i can &apos;t leave my kids with wilson .
wilson is a hoodlum .
i leave my kids with my person .
christina did it all the time .
cristina yang watched your kids ?
yes .
i don &apos;t buy that for a second .
talk to jo .
no jo !
she asked you to watch her kids ?
yeah , she &apos;s wigging out
about trying to go to d.c. to see derek .
why didn &apos;t she ask me ? i &apos;m a person .
that &apos;s not what she meant . - what --
and you don &apos;t want to be , trust me .
it &apos;s a pain in the ass .
all right , let &apos;s get her prepped .
we need to put her under .
it hurts . it hurts !
okay , we know ,
but we &apos;re gonna put you to sleep ,
and then we can attend to that shoulder .
no , no , my stomach !
uh , hold the anesthesia .
she &apos;s complaining of abdominal pain .
i &apos;m here . where do you need me ?
uh , can you bring the ultrasound ?
all right , i don &apos;t see any wounds
in her torso or her legs or ...
uh , bailey ?
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll need that ultrasound .
come here and tell me
if i am seeing what i think i &apos;m seeing .
oh , my goodness . oh , my goodness .
what ? ! what &apos;s going on ?
uh , let &apos;s page o.b. !
okay , okay .
brenda , how far along are you ?
what ?
i don &apos;t know -- -why didn &apos;t you tell us that you were pregnant ?
because i &apos;m not ! that &apos;s impossible .
tell them to get here fast ! bring me the stirrups .
yes , doctor .
no , i &apos;m not pregnant !
i can &apos;t get pregnant ! i can &apos;t have a baby !
you are having one .
i &apos;m looking at its head right now .
aah !
anderson ?
that &apos;s a last name as a first name .
i hate last names as first names .
i have a last name as a first name .
this is gonna be too big on me .
i should &apos;ve brought something from home .
come on .
i still like -- - no !
i &apos;m sorry .
i know he &apos;s your favorite uncle ,
but you can &apos;t name a child norbert .
norbert &apos;s the kid that gets his lunch money stolen .
now -- he &apos;s the kid that gets punched on the playground .
that &apos;s not gonna be our kid .
all right , ready for ...
i &apos;ll come back .
okay .
i think it &apos;s time to put on the gown .
no , it &apos;s not time .
we don &apos;t have a name yet .
we can &apos;t do this without a name .
we may only have a couple of minutes
with our son once --
i am not gonna spend that time trying to figure out a name .
can we -- just give me -- just give me a minute , okay ?
just wait .
i just , i want ... i just want to wait in case ...
in case what ?
it happens .
jackson , they happen , all right ?
mir-- miracles , they -- they happen to people .
there are documented medical cases
that cannot be explained by science .
what if this is one of those and --
and we &apos;re deciding to do this today ,
when if we just --
i don &apos;t even know why i &apos;m talking to you about this .
i &apos;m not doing this .
i thought i could , but i can &apos;t .
i won &apos;t .
april .
where are you going ?
okay , call o.b. again !
here , hold pressure .
uh , get a baby warmer in here .
uh , gown us , please .
how does someone go through nine months
and not even know she &apos;s pregnant ?
it happens . how did we not know ?
what happened to those damn lab results ?
i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know !
i gave them to an intern , and i told her --
i gave them to you , not to an intern .
so you damn well better find out
what happened to them . now !
who the hell left this here ?
uh , what do you need ?
this kind of crap
would never happen when kepner &apos;s here .
i @-@ i &apos;ll take it up there .
so , if o.b. doesn &apos;t get here , um , who &apos;s catching ?
uh , you are .
oh , i was gonna say you were .
uh , i fix bones .
you guys are wrong !
i &apos;m not pregnant !
is that another contraction ?
no , my -- ow , my shoulder !
okay , more lidocaine .
brenda , we can &apos;t put you under until the baby &apos;s born .
all right , someone , uh , call peds !
i &apos;m having a baby ? i am ?
yes , you are , brenda .
i can &apos;t have babies .
i want to , but they told me i can &apos;t ever .
okay , well , they were wrong , sweetie .
you can and you are , so get ready .
on the next contraction , i &apos;m gonna need you to push , okay ?
pulse ox is dropping .
the hematoma &apos;s compressing the trachea .
she &apos;s gonna lose her airway !
oh , god , okay .
okay , all right , we &apos;re almost there , brenda .
i want you to push for me , okay ?
one , two , three , push !
that &apos;s great . that &apos;s great .
okay , try it again . one , two , three , push !
no ! no , no , no . don &apos;t push .
she &apos;s straining too hard . she &apos;s dislodged the clot .
uh , lap pads , lap pads .
hold pressure with me here .
bailey . bailey , it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay . you did it , brenda .
you did it .
brenda , you have a little girl .
hey , you know how this is done ?
not a clue .
hey , uh , did yang ever watch meredith &apos;s kids ?
see , i knew it . mer &apos;s full of crap .
i don &apos;t have to babysit for her .
no , no , she did .
cristina would take zola . she &apos;d take her home .
and then when the diaper blew out ,
she &apos;d hold her up to me like a bag of medical waste .
cristina would study .
she &apos;d eat all of zola &apos;s snacks .
and i would be the one down on the floor
playing with blocks , so yes and no .
what are you doing this weekend ?
i &apos;d do it for cristina ,
i &apos;m not doing it for you .
damn it .
so , his eyes still work ,
it &apos;s just the communication to the brain ?
but his tumor &apos;s in the corpus callosum ,
pushing into both occipital lobes .
right .
he &apos;ll probably never see again .
but you said -- - i said we &apos;d try .
what &apos;s this ? taking on new cases ?
you told me you were going &quot; all my tumor , all the time . &quot;
giving up on me ?
on the contrary .
i &apos;m going to use a co2 laser
to peel a man &apos;s glioma off layer by layer .
it &apos;s the same technique i &apos;ll be using on your optic nerve .
it &apos;s how i &apos;ll keep you from going blind
when i save you .
and here , i thought i &apos;d won you over to the dark side .
never .
keep hope alive .
so , we &apos;re practicing on him ?
on drew for herman ?
even though you don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna see again .
that &apos;s one way to look at it .
another way is we &apos;re giving him time --
more years to live .
let &apos;s go .
have radiology send everything up to the o.r.
okay , put her out .
let &apos;s intubate !
wait , wait , can i hold her ?
i &apos;m here ! glove me .
okay , we need to help you breathe now .
i just need to see her .
i need to hold her . she &apos;s crying .
where &apos;s my baby ?
no -- oh , no .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m gonna take her and do an exam .
she &apos;ll be here when you wake up , okay ?
let me hold my baby !
look , if we do , she might lose you , honey .
there &apos;s no time . let us work .
please --
i &apos;m so sorry , brenda .
she &apos;s throwing multifocal pvcs
what the hell !
uh , it &apos;s probabl--
um , ultrasound !
here . let me have those films .
okay .
where are you ?
oh , damn it .
where is what ?
there was a pellet at the vessels .
it should be right there , and it isn &apos;t .
which means it moved into her heart .
runs of v @-@ tach ! okay , uh , 75 of lido .
let &apos;s get a repeat chest film !
page cardio !
brenda , no more surprises !
it was a urine sample and two blood draws .
i @-@ i gave it to an intern , and i told her to --
i found it sitting on a supply rack .
which intern ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know .
she was about this tall , dark haired ?
hey , richard .
when you find her , find me .
no , when i find her , i &apos;m gonna kill her .
hi . so , i &apos;m on call this weekend ,
and i was wondering if you could take it .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i might have plans .
catherine avery &apos;s in town , and she &apos;s going through hell .
and i &apos;d like to be able to tell her
i &apos;ll be available if she needs me for anything .
never mind . i &apos;ll find someone else .
i @-@ is there a problem ?
i @-@ it &apos;s not a big deal .
we can just drop it .
everything okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s fine .
really ?
you can tell me .
i &apos;d rather not .
you said it was important .
it &apos;s just , mm , sex .
emergency sex with my husband .
should &apos;ve dropped it .
told you .
april .
just wait .
let me go .
okay , you &apos;re right about miracles , okay ?
sometimes they happen .
there are hearts that start beating again .
there &apos;s cancer that just goes away on its own .
i know . i &apos;ve seen it .
it happens sometimes .
but this , april -- this is not that .
i know .
this isn &apos;t fair .
it isn &apos;t ... just .
and i have spent my life believing in a god who is just .
he gave me a calling , and i followed it .
i save lives every day .
i feel like i &apos;m -- i &apos;m finally becoming the person
that he wants me to be .
and then this -- to be handed this ?
it &apos;s cruel .
i feel like god is laughing at me .
if this is a test , i fail .
all those years trusting and believing
and praying ...
and if this -- if this were just ,
even a tiny bit , then i could maybe ...
i can &apos;t . i have to go back to work .
i ha-- i have to go to work .
you &apos;re messing with me .
i &apos;m not .
you are .
i &apos;m not .
that &apos;s your little girl .
it &apos;s a mistake .
brenda couldn &apos;t have a baby . she wasn &apos;t pregnant !
she was and she did .
it was your wife -- shotgun wound .
had a baby .
no , she couldn &apos;t get pregnant !
we tried !
for years !
we saw doctors . all of them said we couldn &apos;t .
and brenda was so ... sad .
and mad , at herself , and at me &apos; cause we can &apos;t have a baby .
you do .
we didn &apos;t know it ? we --
we just didn &apos;t know she was pregnant ?
it happens .
this was the whole reason for the hunting trips
and the jet skis , trips to bali and stuff .
i said to her , &quot; babe , if it &apos;s just gonna be us ,
let &apos;s make us an adventure . &quot;
but she really wanted a baby .
we both did .
you can hold her if you want .
yeah ?
yeah .
yes .
how &apos;s my wife ?
she &apos;s gonna die if i don &apos;t get that out .
the pellet is bouncing all around the right ventricle .
that &apos;s what &apos;s causing her arrhythmias .
i &apos;m gonna have to open her up .
let &apos;s get ready to put her on bypass !
damn it , how did we get here ?
look , she had a baby she never had a chance to hold ,
so if you could just -- - that &apos;s not helping .
i &apos;ll prep the femoral artery .
she &apos;s arresting ! crash cart !
charge to 200 .
husband wants to know how she &apos;s doing .
clear !
aw , crap .
i have a pulse .
we have sinus !
splash her with betadine . get me some towels .
for what it &apos;s worth , this is kind of a miracle baby .
i mean , they never thought they could have one .
so , you might be saving a whole family .
none of this is helping me !
ten blade !
she &apos;s gonna die if i don &apos;t get that out .
god ...
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know , uh ...
if you &apos;re out there or not , um ,
or if you can even hear people
who don &apos;t know if you &apos;re out there .
or if you give a crap about what they say .
but , um ... god , yahweh ,
buddha , e.t. , whatever ...
april ... knows .
right ? she believes .
and she needs you .
so , uh ...
um , show up for her ?
please ?
show up for april .
she loves you .
she needs you .
please , uh ...
show up for her .
please .
didn &apos;t expect to see you here .
they asked me for some privacy , so ... i &apos;m staying away .
what can i do ?
how many months has it been
since that day in boston ?
about six .
six months . six .
yet it took something like this
for you to pick up a phone and call .
i wanted to , uh , several times , i --
richard , i @-@ i @-@ i think
we don &apos;t need to talk about that right now .
okay .
if there &apos;s any way i can help ...
... if there is anything i can do for you ,
or for them ... i &apos;m here .
i think i just want to be alone .
and you have to keep the laser moving all the time .
remove the tumor cell by cell
like zapping dust off of a carpet .
without singeing the carpet .
exactly .
now , when we use this on herman &apos;s tumor ,
it &apos;ll be on her optic chiasm and nerve .
and rather than restoring drew &apos;s sight ,
we &apos;ll have to keep her from going blind .
see . there . you just said it .
said what ?
you said &quot; restoring drew &apos;s sight . &quot;
you need to let that go .
i knew it .
you wouldn &apos;t have said it if you couldn &apos;t do it .
you wouldn &apos;t have even tried .
the tumor is everywhere . it &apos;s impossible .
i knew that 20 minutes into this surgery .
okay , so , why don &apos;t you stop ? why are you still working ?
to improve my technique .
that &apos;s ...
you should stop .
why ?
you don &apos;t feel the slightest bit guilty ?
guilty ? why ?
for using this nice , funny man ,
for turning him into a skills lab .
i can &apos;t use a human being for practice .
you feel guilty
because you are thinking about you .
and this has nothing to do with you .
this is about drew .
this was his last hope .
the chances were slim , and drew knew that .
so i am thinking about what to say to him
when he finds out that that last hope is gone .
that is what you should be thinking about ,
not your own guilt .
clamps off .
up with the flow .
come on , start beating .
all right , we &apos;re gonna have to use some electricity .
charge the paddles to 20 .
charged .
clear .
oh , god .
again .
her heart &apos;s been through a lot today .
she got shot and she had a baby .
clear !
brenda !
you are going to hold your baby .
do you understand me ?
you have a little girl who wants to meet you ,
so you are going to show up for that
and you are going to hold her .
clear !
i got things covered . you don &apos;t have to be here if ...
you don &apos;t want me here ?
no .
no , this place doesn &apos;t work without you .
it &apos;s been a mess here today .
i need you here ,
but not if you don &apos;t need to be here .
i want to be here .
no one has seen my mysterious intern .
no one &apos;s even heard of her .
i run the e.r. i know every intern .
what &apos;s her name ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
i mean , she -- she &apos;s dark haired ,
she &apos;s got a vacant look on her face ,
and she -- she &apos;s right there .
hey ! hey , you .
why didn &apos;t you do what i asked you to ?
warren .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t know if ...
and -- and why do you still have this ?
i told you this morning to just -- - stop it right now .
you don &apos;t work here , do you ?
what &apos;s your name ?
wendy .
these are personal release papers
for a deceased patient .
who is this patient ?
my fiancee ?
you came in last night .
i couldn &apos;t go home .
michael and i were driving home from this lodge .
we thought we might have our wedding there .
and then there was a big truck , and then ...
everyone &apos;s been really nice .
they got me cleaned up .
someone gave me these clothes to wear
because mine were covered in ...
i went down to the cafeteria .
i think they thought i was a doctor .
they gave me food .
i went upstairs to the nursery . i looked at the babies .
and it made me feel a little better .
i &apos;m sorry if i messed up things for that one doctor .
i wasn &apos;t sure ...
they told me i could take
michael &apos;s things home with me when i was ready .
i haven &apos;t been ready .
i know .
we were gonna do so many things .
this was our beginning .
we had so many plans for a life
and a family , and now they &apos;re gone !
they &apos;re gone .
wendy , do you believe in god ?
yes .
but he didn &apos;t .
michael didn &apos;t believe .
it &apos;s okay .
you can believe enough for the two of you .
you have lost somebody ,
and you are hurting ,
but you will get through this .
you can survive this .
you are strong .
it &apos;s okay .
you are gonna be okay .
i promise .
samuel norbert avery .
that should be our son &apos;s name .
it should ?
i think i got what i was waiting for .
you did ?
let &apos;s go back upstairs .
i &apos;m ready now .
meredith ?
uh , my plans have changed .
uh , i &apos;d be happy to take your weekend call .
you should go .
thanks , but it &apos;s fine .
i can go another time . it &apos;s not a big deal .
no , no .
take it from a man who has spent his life
regretting the flights he never took .
get on the plane , see derek .
it is a big deal .
but i don &apos;t have anyone to watch my kids
and amelia is working , so --
i am here .
what ?
i said i &apos;m here .
i moved here alone and i have made one friend ,
and i consider you my friend .
oh , i @-@ i just -- i mean , i didn &apos;t even --
no , i &apos;m just saying .
if you ever need something ,
like if you ever need help moving
or , like , a ride to the airport ,
like , i &apos;m that kind of friend .
but i can &apos;t ask you to babysit my kids .
are you kidding me ? i would love to .
i was a girl scout , and i was registered
with a babysitting service as a teenager .
and i &apos;m good .
i mean , i &apos;m a &quot; play
on the floor and cook for them &quot; babysitter .
you cook ?
and i bake .
kids love baking ,
and i love babies , and babies love me .
and , you know , they &apos;re my niece and nephew ,
so i would -- i would love to . i would love to .
you -- you don &apos;t have to bake .
okay , but can i ?
we were pretty successful .
we were able to remove about 98 % of your tumor ,
so you &apos;ve got a few more years coming to you .
well , i haven &apos;t been able
to bring myself to open up my eyes yet .
why don &apos;t you do that now ?
okay .
somebody say something so i know who &apos;s who .
you can see ?
i @-@ it &apos;s blurry , but it &apos;s -- yeah !
okay , that may improve , it may not .
drew , we &apos;ll run some tests , but --
it &apos;s -- but that &apos;s -- i didn &apos;t think that i should hope .
dr. lavender .
you did it .
i -- i mean , i knew you could do it .
even when you said it was impossible -- - because it was .
but you pulled it off !
and you said to stop .
that &apos;s the difference .
i know what it is to walk into a hospital o.r.
with little or no chance of success ,
to do all of the planning and hoping and labor ,
knowing that in the end ,
it may amount to nothing .
it &apos;s impossible .
but it is what is asked of us .
and if you can &apos;t do it ,
if you aren &apos;t willing to keep looking for light
in the darkest of places without stopping
even when it seems impossible , you will never succeed .
what i am doing next with herman
is much , much harder than this .
i only need to be better ,
and i am gonna get there any way i can .
if you are not willing to do that ,
then you shouldn &apos;t be working with me
and you probably shouldn &apos;t be a surgeon .
understand ?
everything all right ?
hey , the candle thing does work , by the way .
so , thanks for that .
howard ?
are you okay ?
no .
this is just a lot for one day .
for a lifetime .
you ready ?
oh , that &apos;s her .
she &apos;s real ?
here she is .
here &apos;s mama .
look at you .
oh , look at you .
you look just like your daddy .
you have his nice chin .
he squeezed my finger .
and then he let go .
we can &apos;t get too close .
if we felt even a little of the love and the joy
and the hopes that our patients are saying goodbye to ...
... we &apos;d never be able to function .
is it over ?
i &apos;m giving them some time .
thank you for today .
i think that it would have been harder
to be in there .
it &apos;s ... never easy for anybody .
so we say , &quot; we &apos;re sorry for your loss . &quot;
and we hope it offers something .
can you just take me home ?
take me home , take me to bed ,
and just hold me ?
some little bit of support .
some bit of peace .
some bit of closure .
something good .
some little piece of beauty
in the midst of someplace dark .
my baby lived for 43 minutes .
an unexpected gift ...
just when it &apos;s needed most .
how was your weekend ? in dc ? with your husband ?
it , was fun .
i am not here to judge you . but i &apos;m a bad liar .
i don &apos;t know what you are talking about .
you packed a suitcase full
of lingerie and you went away for the weekend .
yeah i -
derek called me three times asking where you were .
whatever you were doing -
it wasn &apos;t with him .
