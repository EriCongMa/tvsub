&lt; i &gt; nora looked for trouble , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and found it . &lt; / i &gt;
you will never again see my husband .
&lt; i &gt; julie got to know edie &apos;s nephew . &lt; / i &gt;
couldn &apos;t take her eyes off my abs .
i felt violated .
&lt; i &gt; susan and ian made plans . &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;d love to go to france someday .
would you like to go next month ?
&lt; i &gt; gabrielle and carlos reunited . &lt; / i &gt;
it &apos;s been a long time .
&lt; i &gt; and dinner with the bigsbys ... &lt; / i &gt;
that &apos;s the police report that alma filed after orson hit her .
&lt; i &gt; ... was full of surprises . &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;m going through something . i had an affair .
&lt; i &gt; it was supposed to be an ordinary day for carolyn bigsby . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; she had planned to bake her husband a strudel , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; give her dog a bath , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and water her african violets . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; yes , carolyn had planned to do &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; all sorts of things she thought mattered . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but earlier that day , a woman who wasn &apos;t her friend &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; told carolyn something she wasn &apos;t supposed to hear . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; from that moment on , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; carolyn felt nothing really mattered anymore . &lt; / i &gt;
hello , carolyn .
yeah , hey , how are you ?
carolyn , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve been thinking , harvey ,
that if you love this monique woman so much ,
maybe you should be with her .
for god &apos;s sake , carolyn , she &apos;s dead .
yeah , i know .
&lt; i &gt; yes , carolyn bigsby had planned on
it being an ordinary day . &lt; / i &gt;
harvey , you come out of there , damn it .
&lt; i &gt; but as every housewife knows ... &lt; / i &gt;
down . nobody goes anywhere .
&lt; i &gt; ... plans change . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; lynette scavo had a dream last night . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it was one she &apos;d had many times before . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; she dreamt of the last time she saw me . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and of the last time we spoke . &lt; / i &gt;
hey , mary alice !
are you ok ?
yes , thank you .
i &apos;m fine .
ok .
see you later .
&lt; i &gt; it was still hard for lynette to accept &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that this unremarkable exchange had been our last . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; or that moments later i would enter my house &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and put a bullet through my brain . &lt; / i &gt;
i had the mary alice dream again last night .
oh , hon , again ?
i haven &apos;t had it for months .
i don &apos;t know why it came back .
somebody just bought her old house .
maybe that triggered something .
it was awful , as always .
i saw she was in pain and i just walked away .
there was nothing you could do .
and that &apos;s what i did , nothing .
hey , is that the new neighbor ?
he &apos;s cute .
edie said he &apos;s a bachelor .
keep talking .
who lives with his invalid sister .
you can stop now .
should we go introduce ourselves ?
yeah . let &apos;s give him the scoop on the neighborhood .
do you think he knows
mary alice shot herself in his living room ?
then again , he probably wants some time to unpack .
orson , if you have a moment ,
there &apos;s something i &apos;d like your thoughts on .
certainly . what is it ?
menu for our holiday open house ?
no ! it &apos;s a police report from the night you beat your first wife .
i &apos;m still working on the menu .
i assure you , i did not beat my wife .
she suffered these injuries in a fall .
how did she fall ?
i pushed her .
it was self @-@ defense . she attacked me .
why would she attack you ?
she spilled some red wine on a white table cloth .
she was cleaning it with dish soap .
when i pointed out her mistake ,
she started screaming , &quot; shut up ! shut up ! &quot;
and striking me repeatedly with a saute pan .
look . the police dropped the charges .
where did you get this ?
carolyn .
oh , of course . who else ?
if she paid this much attention to her own marriage
maybe harvey wouldn &apos;t have cheated on her .
harvey cheated ?
yes !
with some flight attendant named monique .
darling , i could never strike a woman .
well , you do believe me , don &apos;t you ?
all right . i accept your explanation .
i just wish there were fewer things for you to explain .
by the way ,
to remove a red wine stain you sprinkle salt to absorb it .
that &apos;s just what i was saying to alma when she clocked me !
whoa . what fresh hell is this ?
hey , tom ?
you &apos;ve stepped onto my property and talked to tom .
that &apos;s two rules you &apos;ve broken
and i &apos;m not sure that top doesn &apos;t make three .
would you tell your lunatic wife i &apos;m not talking to her ?
you &apos;re the lunatic if you think i &apos;m letting you
near my husband .
just drop kayla off and go .
kayla won &apos;t be visiting today .
we &apos;re moving ,
and here &apos;s where you can send the child support .
mexico ?
an old friend of mine got me a sweet job
dancing at a nightclub .
in tijuana .
great . and you &apos;re taking kayla ?
thank your wife .
she &apos;s been itching to get rid of us ever since we got here .
she finally got her way .
wave bye @-@ bye to your daddy , honey .
nora , can we just talk about this ?
oh , we &apos;re not allowed to talk .
remember ?
she &apos;s tom &apos;s daughter .
can &apos;t just take her out of the country .
watch me .
does either party have anything to add before i rule on
division of assets and alimony ?
no , we &apos;re confident that your ruling will reflect
the pain and suffering endured by my client .
does the definition of suffering encompass
the seduction of my client four days ago ?
excuse me ?
she thought he was coming into money
and hoped to stall the divorce
until she could claim her share .
how dare you ! that is a vicious lie .
&lt; i &gt; oh , carlos , give it to me ! &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; carlos , yes , yes ! &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; carlos ! &lt; / i &gt;
you recorded our lovemaking ?
it &apos;s all here , your honor .
when she climaxes she starts screaming out dollar amounts .
mrs. solis , would you like to respond ?
as a matter of fact , i do have a few thoughts .
carlos , you &apos;re a dead man . do you hear me ?
the ruling seems fair to me .
you get the house .
i just get everything in it .
i said &quot; dead &quot; !
no alimony . that &apos;s a drag .
but you like to work , right ?
just give me one shot at him . i &apos;m willing to do the time !
i was packing your suitcase ,
you &apos;re out of toothpaste .
do you want me to go to the store and get some ?
what is this ?
it was austin &apos;s , ok ?
edie &apos;s nephew ? since when are you friends ?
we are not friends .
i was tutoring him . he brought beer .
i told him to throw it out , he did . end of story .
did you have any ?
i cannot believe your timing .
i about to fly off to paris
and you &apos;re inviting boys over for oktoberfest .
that &apos;s it .
go and finish packing . this conversation &apos;s over .
last time i checked i was the parent .
yeah . last time i checked i was the daughter
who never gave you any reason to doubt her .
ok . and ...
don &apos;t play the parent card with me .
i finished packing your suitcase ,
doing your laundry and balancing your checkbook .
and now i &apos;m going to the store to buy your toothpaste .
a simple &quot; no , i didn &apos;t drink any beer &quot; would &apos;ve sufficed .
bree , you haven &apos;t returned my calls . i &apos;ve been worried .
have you told the wife beater you &apos;re leaving him ?
sorry , no .
turns out he has an explanation for the police report .
come on . there &apos;s never a good reason for hitting a woman .
i used to think that , too . then i met you .
good day .
i &apos;m trying to help you . you &apos;re living in a fool &apos;s paradise .
well , i guess that makes us neighbors .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means you should stop worrying about my marriage
and start worrying about your own .
don &apos;t play coy with me .
you &apos;ve got something to say , just say it .
ok . does the name monique mean anything to you ?
hey , i found this site that offers really cheap fares to tijuana ,
but should i even be thinking of going to tijuana ?
fine with me .
as soon as you figure out a way to leave your genitals here .
what are you saying , lynette ?
i &apos;m not allowed to visit my daughter or what ?
see ? this is exactly what she wants .
she takes kayla and i get blamed .
well , screw her . let &apos;s sue for custody .
full custody ? you &apos;d go for that ?
you bet i would .
kayla will be much better off without &quot; crazy &quot; in her life .
so will we .
i ... i am right there with you .
i just ... i never thought you &apos;d want a fifth kid .
i don &apos;t .
but i didn &apos;t want the first four
and they &apos;re starting to grow on me .
hey . look whose plastic handcuffs got taken off .
ok . you &apos;re clearly still a little miffed about the settlement .
come on , be fair .
i did buy most of the stuff in this house , honey .
what the hell are you doing ?
oh , i &apos;m helping you pack .
think of all the money you &apos;re gonna save on bubble wrap .
hey ! do you know how much that was worth ?
do you know how much i was worth ?
when we met i was on the cover of magazines .
i had a career and a future .
but i gave it all up for you . and what did i get in return ?
if you break one more thing , so help me .
what ? what are you gonna do ?
carlos , have you lost your mind ?
well , you &apos;re helping me pack my stuff .
i &apos;m helping you remodel your house .
you know , i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i always thought there should be a window
that was right there .
we could stop this right now
or we can keep on playing . your call .
toothpaste . mouthwash .
did somebody get an anonymous email ?
said the boy with the economic size acne cream .
there you go again , checking out my basket .
go away .
do you know how much trouble your beer can got me in ?
let me make it up to you .
i &apos;ll carry your stuff .
whatever .
yeah ?
harvey , it &apos;s me .
hey , hon , i &apos;m in the middle of something here , so ...
i know about monique .
um ... excuse me a sec .
look , i don &apos;t know who you &apos;ve been talking to , but , um ...
did you love her ?
she was just a friend .
and she disappeared eight months ago .
the police just found her body .
eight months ago ? that &apos;s right .
when you fell into that big depression .
and i kept thinking ,
&quot; why is harvey so blue ? how do i cheer him up ? &quot;
that was about her , wasn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s over . she &apos;s dead .
but if she weren &apos;t ,
who would you be with , me or her ?
she &apos;s dead .
that &apos;ll be $ 12.99 .
i &apos;ll take your field &apos;s card .
couldn &apos;t keep your wallet in your pants .
mr. bigsby ?
look , um ...
... i gotta go .
mommy , look at us !
i &apos;ll look as soon as i get back from the store .
bye , mom !
this is edie .
yeah , i &apos;m his aunt .
he shoplifted what ?
yeah , yeah , yeah . be right there .
you &apos;re still packing ? we &apos;re going to be late .
no . we &apos;re fine .
besides , i can &apos;t leave
until julie gets back with my toothpaste .
we don &apos;t need it . i packed a large tube and dental floss .
really ?
why are americans so amazed when the english display
the slightest acquaintance with dental hygiene ?
ok . i &apos;m gonna need some help with this big baby .
go . zip , zip , zip .
susan , do you really need all this ? we &apos;re not emigrating .
it &apos;s my first time to paris . i want it to be magical .
and that means accessories , so back off .
it &apos;s the fashion capitol of the world .
while i &apos;m working take my credit card and buy new things .
no , no , i am not gonna spend your money .
i have an expense account .
and you just tell me this now ?
i &apos;ll tell the driver you &apos;ll be a minute .
hello .
yes , this is her mother .
what ?
well , you &apos;re gonna love the neighborhood .
are you all moved in ?
pretty much .
just waiting on medical equipment for my sister .
oh . yeah , i heard she isn &apos;t well .
can i ask what &apos;s wrong with her ?
of course .
unfortunately , she has this rare degenerative ...
that &apos;s rough . excuse me .
you told me you weren &apos;t friends with him .
now you shoplift together ?
mom , you know i wouldn &apos;t steal .
i want to believe that .
but suddenly you &apos;re having boys over , you &apos;re drinking beer ...
and soon she &apos;ll be listening to
that rock and roll music everybody talks about .
so , how are we gonna handle this ?
i have somebody in the car who &apos;s late for a plane .
can you give me two minutes ?
mom !
i am so disappointed in you .
hello , carolyn .
yeah . hey , how are you ?
look , make him work it off .
you get a free stock boy for a month .
a month ? it was a ten dollar bottle of whiskey .
exactly .
you weren &apos;t even smart enough to steal the good stuff .
harvey , don &apos;t walk away .
come on . let &apos;s sort this out .
hey , nora , how &apos;s tricks ?
i thought it was your car i saw in the lot .
you &apos;re a conniving bitch .
ah . i see you &apos;ve heard from our lawyer .
so , it &apos;s not enough that you run me out of town .
you gotta steal my damn kid .
carolyn , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve been thinking , harvey ,
that if you love monique so much ...
even you have to admit kayla would be better off with us
than in a dingy apartment over a tijuana strip club .
believe me , lynette ,
you do not want to screw with me .
you went after my husband .
if anyone should be afraid , it &apos;s you .
go !
go !
harvey !
harvey , you come out of there , damn it !
down .
everybody down .
nobody goes anywhere .
don &apos;t move . get down .
you can &apos;t be serious . we have tickets .
the plane leaves in two hours .
i &apos;m sorry . i know , julie picked a lousy time to rebel .
i just can &apos;t fly off and ignore it .
you &apos;re overreacting .
it &apos;s an adolescent prank
and you &apos;re turning it into some great bloody crisis .
you have a lot of meetings , anyway .
we &apos;ll go some other time ?
i can &apos;t leave julie right now .
we &apos;ll take her with us !
oh , that &apos;s responsible parenting .
stealing whiskey ?
that &apos;s it , young lady , i &apos;m taking you to paris .
ah , but that &apos;s just some ruse .
once we get her on the plane we make her fly coach ,
middle seat , no mercy .
i &apos;m sorry .
it won &apos;t be paris without you .
hey . what the hell &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s mrs. bigsby . she has a gun .
what ?
i said nobody move .
she &apos;s at the back .
i think we can make it .
attention shoppers ,
we &apos;re having a special today on not getting shot .
but it &apos;s only available at the back of the store .
hey , how are you ?
thanks for joining us . do i know you ?
my son jordan &apos;s in your sunday school class .
oh , he &apos;s a great little boy .
so don &apos;t do anything
that will make him wake up tomorrow without a mommy .
um , for the rest of you , hi , i &apos;m carolyn .
i &apos;m sorry for putting a crimp in your day .
i &apos;m pretty sure that
my cheating husband is phoning the police .
so i &apos;m counting on all you folks to help me
to keep them outside
till harvey and i have a chance to ... talk things over .
harvey !
you &apos;re inconveniencing your customers . get out here !
yeah , she &apos;s got hostages !
oh , my god . austin &apos;s there . and julie !
get your ass out there before someone gets hurt !
what am i , a moron ? she &apos;ll shoot me .
she has got ten innocent people out there .
sometimes you &apos;ve got to take one for the team .
hello .
hello . sweetie , it &apos;s mommy .
i need to talk to daddy .
porter &apos;s hogging all the legos .
tell him i said to share . now , put daddy on !
i did tell him !
but he says he needs them all for his robot .
put daddy on and i &apos;ll buy you a real robot .
you will ?
a big one with laser beam eyes . now , go get daddy .
i &apos;m getting a real robot .
i &apos;m having a real bad day here .
is a little cooperation too much to ask ?
lynette ?
lynette ?
down at the supermarket . no , no , it &apos;s terrible . terrible .
excuse me , what &apos;s going on ?
there &apos;s a crazy woman with a gun .
in there !
no , no , no , stay back ! stay back !
carolyn , open up . my daughter &apos;s inside .
sorry . store &apos;s closed .
there &apos;s a crazy woman in there .
yeah , i know .
yeah ?
quick , turn on the tv .
it &apos;s kind of on the fritz .
turn on your radio .
if you &apos;d come ten minutes earlier .
a woman &apos;s shooting at field &apos;s market .
she &apos;s got hostages .
oh , my god .
we &apos;re all watching it over at bree &apos;s house
uh , is everything ok here ?
yeah , everything &apos;s fine . we &apos;re having a little squabble .
would you give us a minute ?
carlos , where do you think you &apos;re going with that ?
information is very thin at this time .
we do not see anybody in the front of the building ...
coffee &apos;s almost ready .
if you &apos;d prefer to watch the coverage on channel nine ,
it &apos;s on in the den .
orson , greta needs a coaster .
bree , have you heard ?
awful , it &apos;s just awful .
deviled egg ?
oh , thank you .
i told you she &apos;d have food .
i &apos;m sure some of you
might be thinking that this is all my fault .
and that i &apos;m the bad guy here . but i &apos;m not . he is .
will you people stop calling me ?
i &apos;m right in the middle of something .
he humiliated me .
first he cheated on me with a stewardess named monique .
how cliche is that ?
and then he told people about it .
now there are news trucks out there .
judy pope &apos;s husband has an affair , nobody finds out .
mine cheats and they break into programming !
the whole town is laughing at me .
you hear that , harvey ?
i only told one person .
well , it was clearly the wrong one .
i told you to stop calling me !
tish , i &apos;m sorry . i thought it was somebody else .
oh , my god . was that today ? i &apos;m so sorry .
i know , tish . yeah , i know . i know i ...
how can you look so calm ?
aren &apos;t you scared ?
no .
because i &apos;m not gonna die today .
and neither are you .
tish , i really don &apos;t think that i can .
i &apos;m telling you . oh , tish , for god &apos;s sakes .
turn on your damn tv .
excuse me . my name is susan mayer .
ma &apos;am , this is a restricted area .
i &apos;d like to trade places
with one of the people inside . you do that ?
oh , you mean our hostage exchange program ?
you don &apos;t have to be nasty . my daughter is inside .
ma &apos;am , we &apos;re doing everything we can to get her out safely .
now , please step back .
i want the perimeter locked down . nobody in , nobody out .
see if you can get me a phone line with the manager &apos;s office .
attention , attention , carolyn bigsby .
where is that coming from ?
this is susan mayer ... again .
first of all , i &apos;m sorry for the crazy lady remark .
second , i have a proposition for you .
find her now !
let julie go and take me instead .
repeat . take me . i will be a model hostage .
if we have a deal , signal by sending julie to the ...
get your hands off me . carolyn , carolyn ,
call my cell . it &apos;s 572 ...
now , we don &apos;t know
where anyone is inside the building right now .
we are standing by waiting for information .
i &apos;m hoping to talk to the chief of police in a couple minutes ,
and get a few more details .
andrew , would you get the phone ?
police have just released the name of the hostage taker .
it &apos;s carolyn bigsby ,
wife of store owner harvey bigsby .
harvey has informed police that he is barricaded inside ...
oh , my god , bree . don &apos;t you know her ?
yes .
i just ran into her this morning .
mom ?
that was edie britt on the phone .
she &apos;s inside the market .
is she all right ?
yeah . uh , she &apos;s locked inside the manager &apos;s office .
but she said that julie mayer
and mrs. scavo are with the hostages .
would you mind watching the kids ?
i &apos;ve got a doctor &apos;s appointment
and lynette is taking her sweet time at the market .
i &apos;m sorry , you guys having a party ?
we continue to report live on the scene
the hostage standoff at field &apos;s market enters its 3rd hour .
according to a police spokesman ,
there has been no further contact from the hostage taker .
we continue to wait for the latest information .
no new news at this point .
we &apos;ll bring you the latest as soon as it becomes available .
you all right ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m just running out of food .
and it &apos;s not as if i can go to the grocery store .
bree .
thank god i found this stale baguette
so i can make bruschetta . and there &apos;s shrimp ,
so i &apos;m gonna make my rice and seafood dish ...
bree , this is not your fault .
i had to tell her .
she hurt me , so i hurt her back .
if anything should happen to julie or lynette ...
is there anything i can do ?
you can peel a clove of garlic .
ok .
i wanted kids .
i wanted kids so badly ,
but harvey had two from his first wife .
he said it made her fat .
harvey likes them lean
i run four miles a day .
it &apos;s my first cookie in six years .
did you hear that , harvey ?
i &apos;m breaking my diet !
she &apos;s starting to lose it out there . what do i do ?
just keep her calm . tell her you &apos;re sorry .
and see if you can get her
to release the kids and old people .
ok , i &apos;ll try .
carolyn , honey , uh , it &apos;s me .
harvey .
listen , i &apos;m really sorry .
what i did was wrong .
but i still love you a lot .
cut the crap .
i had my hair done this morning .
did you notice , huh ?
did you even notice ?
well , i was distracted .
you were shooting at me .
tell her let the kids go .
who the hell was that ? !
you got a woman in there ?
she &apos;s a customer .
don &apos;t lie to me , harvey !
she &apos;s another one of your whores , isn &apos;t she ?
oh , fantastic .
carolyn , i swear .
shut up !
i hope you &apos;re having a good time in there , whore !
&apos;cause i got a bullet for you , too .
god , what a nightmare .
you know what the weird part is ?
what ?
i keep thinking about that crazy lady in the market and ...
i understand her .
i could be her .
come on .
no , i mean it .
the rage that i have felt in this past six months ...
if i had a gun in the courthouse today ...
you could never shoot me .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m capable of anymore .
this divorce has turned me into
this bitter , hateful person .
and i don &apos;t like her .
hey , baby .
for what it &apos;s worth ,
i don &apos;t like who it &apos;s turned you into , either .
then let &apos;s stop being those people .
ok .
ok .
hey , just so you know ,
i heard the woman in there teaches sunday school .
a sunday school teacher would never hurt a kid .
no way .
thank you .
i &apos;m sure lynette &apos;s gonna be fine , too .
oh , i &apos;m not worried about lynette .
hell , with lynette in there
they don &apos;t even need that negotiator .
you put lynette in a room
with a woman who wants to shoot her husband ,
she &apos;ll have them renewing their vows .
right . lynette is very persuasive .
i give it an hour , tops .
we &apos;ll all be back home and eating our hamburgers .
she was gonna go to the store tomorrow .
but we were out of hamburger .
and i wanted hamburgers .
i hope all this is giving you
a little perspective on our situation .
shh ! she told us not to talk .
you &apos;re thinking about your kids , right ?
how awful it &apos;d be to never see them .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re asking me to feel the rest of my life .
nora , please !
hey , what did i say ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . we &apos;ll be quiet .
you and your friend are starting to bug me .
she &apos;s not my friend .
she &apos;s trying to steal my kid .
nora , shut up !
is that true ?
no !
i ... we &apos;re ... we have ... we &apos;re sharing custody ,
and she tried to seduce my husband , so ...
she put the moves on your husband ?
why didn &apos;t you say so ?
that was a shot .
we just heard a shot fired inside the building .
a shot has been fired .
i believe the phrase you &apos;re looking for is &quot; thank you . &quot;
we just had a shot .
we heard a shot fired inside the market .
police are responding ,
taking this very seriously .
we are going to just continue to stand
and watch and wait and see what happens .
it was on television at the airport .
i came as soon as i could .
the last thing i said to her was that
she disappointed me .
police have just confirmed that a hostage has been shot .
repeat , a hostage has been shot .
there &apos;s no word on the name of the victim at this time ,
but it is believed to be a female .
mrs. hodge ?
when &apos;s mommy gonna be back from the store ?
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be back soon .
why don &apos;t we go have some cookies ?
mommy said we can &apos;t have cookies before dinner .
i &apos;m sure she won &apos;t mind . come on .
let &apos;s go . come on .
ok , i &apos;ve got to keep the pressure on to stop the bleeding .
