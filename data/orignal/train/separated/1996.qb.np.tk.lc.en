we &apos;re suing you and your entire firm for fraud .
i never saw this thing in my life .
that document never came into this office ,
or you would have seen it .
and a lot of people are gonna think i buried that document .
how can you bury what doesn &apos;t exist ?
you think that i don &apos;t know that there &apos;s a power struggle
going on between jessica and hardman ?
this guy gets one whiff of what we &apos;ve been hiding
from hardman ...
i know , we can &apos;t trust him .
louis , is there anything you want to tell me ?
let me explain something to you .
that memo doesn &apos;t hurt me . it helps me .
it &apos;s gone .
your actions have left me no choice
but to terminate your employment at pearson hardman
effective immediately .
ray , i need you to pick me up in an hour ,
and i need you to bring me a tux .
there is my serial--
i &apos;m not here .
god , what ...
what are you doing here ?
are you watching different strokes ?
yeah , well , it &apos;s the touching story
of a couple of orphans , so ...
don &apos;t .
it &apos;s a nice building .
how long ago was it condemned ?
oh , great , so did you come all the way over here
just to criticize where i live , or ...
that &apos;s a side benefit .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
what ?
ah , that-- sentimental value .
so just put that away .
nice panda .
thank you .
grandmother . christmas thing .
get your tux on . we got a situation .
a situation that requires a tux ?
where--where is this tuxedo situation ?
atlantic city . can you get dressed now ?
yeah , i could .
but ?
i don &apos;t have a tux .
i &apos;m not bruce wayne .
don &apos;t i know it .
rachel .
louis , hi .
at the ballet .
are you an aficionado ?
since i was a girl , yes .
me too . i mean , a boy .
i got that .
so are you--
you here with someone ?
you know , donna was supposed to come with me ,
and then she cancelled at the last minute .
oh , you talked to her ? how is she ?
no , i haven &apos;t .
i keep calling , but she just won &apos;t ...
answer . i know . i tried .
you tried ?
yeah .
are you here with someone ?
oh , i &apos;m alone .
i feel it &apos;s a better way to experience the dance , you know ?
too distracting to have to talk about it .
i just want to--
to feel it .
no , i know .
yeah .
yeah .
i should probably get going .
wait . i have an extra ticket , third row .
yeah , i like to buy a seat to my right
just as a precaution .
yeah . i would love to .
great .
yeah . okay .
you just carry around an extra tux
for the random occasion ?
something told me you &apos;d need it .
and by &quot; something , &quot; i mean common sense .
and by &quot; need it , &quot; i mean you &apos;re an idiot .
so can i ask why
we are going to atlantic city instead of just messengering
these contracts ?
no .
you know , i &apos;m sensing a little hostility ,
and you know what i think ?
i think that you &apos;re still stung
about donna , and you see a chance
to blow off some steam , and you need a wingman .
easy , dr. phil . we &apos;re here .
there . how &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s right . we &apos;re not in kansas anymore .
let &apos;s move , dorothy .
you didn &apos;t tell me you were bringing me here .
and that &apos;s a problem how ?
i &apos;m sort of banned from here .
for smoking weed ?
counting cards . i mean , i was smoking weed ,
but they banned me for counting cards .
what ? my brain just does it .
i can &apos;t help that it keeps track .
and that &apos;s your defense ?
it was three years ago . i was broke .
well , which is it , your brain just does it ,
or you were broke ?
what are you , some kind of lawyer ?
get inside . you &apos;re wearing a tux .
they &apos;re not gonna know who you are .
speaking of which , this isn &apos;t havana in the 1950s .
why do we have to wear tuxes ?
what are you , moe green ?
moe green lived in vegas .
i know where moe green lives .
complimentary champagne ?
you think this happens if you walk in here
in a t @-@ shirt and jeans ?
you have a guest , keith hoyt .
can you let him know i &apos;m here ?
mr. hoyt left a message for you to meet him
in the poker room , mr. specter .
the floor manager assured me
that he &apos;d be kept away from the tables .
i &apos;m sorry , i have no record of that here , sir .
double down .
okay , so let me get this straight ,
he has a gambling problem ?
and drinking .
why is he in atlantic city ?
because he &apos;s the keynote speaker at a clean energy conference ,
and he promised me he &apos;d stay out of trouble .
and you took the word of an addict ?
he &apos;s been clean five years .
no drinking , no gambling .
so that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
you &apos;re concerned about him .
yes .
but you also want to gamble .
he has a problem . i do not have a problem .
holy shit .
look at this guy .
those are $ 25,000 chips .
that &apos;s three stacks of four ... twenty by seven ...
that is $ 3,125,000 .
that &apos;s keith .
well , at least we don &apos;t have to worry about him losing .
all in .
or ...
keith .
harvey .
this is a bad idea .
you haven &apos;t seen my hand .
i call .
straight .
full house .
he &apos;s got one out .
yeah , we &apos;re fine
unless the river &apos;s a ...
10 of clubs .
that is some tough luck right there .
tommy , please , just give me 48 hours .
sorry , keith . deal &apos;s a deal .
that was insane .
you just lost $ 3 million . who the hell &apos;s that guy ?
it &apos;s worse . that napkin--
harvey , i just lost my company .
explain to me , how you sell your company
on a cocktail napkin at a poker table .
i didn &apos;t sell it .
i just put it up as collateral .
on a cocktail napkin at a poker table .
i had aces full of kings .
the odds were with him .
come on , you saw it . it was bullshit .
the guy rivered me .
no , what &apos;s bullshit is ,
you should have never been at that table in the first place ,
much less drunk at that table .
i gave the keynote speech , harvey .
they toasted me . i had ... one drink .
you &apos;re an alcoholic at a casino .
you don &apos;t get any drinks .
i &apos;m not an alcoholic . i &apos;m a compulsive gambler .
and those dots aren &apos;t connected ?
let me explain . you had a drink .
you gambled . you lost your company .
i know , it was stupid . is there anything we can do ?
what i should do is walk through that door
and make you live with this .
well , you won &apos;t , will you ?
because you owe me .
what exactly was on the napkin ?
i don &apos;t remember exactly ,
but the deal was , he was gonna give me
$ 3 million to back my bet ,
and when i won , i &apos;d give him his money back
with an extra $ 1 / 2 million .
and if you lost , he &apos;d just get the company .
i didn &apos;t think i could lose .
we need to get a look at that napkin .
i need to get a look at that napkin .
you need to keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn &apos;t
touch a drink , a chip , or a deck of cards .
wait , wait , wait , wait . i &apos;m at atlantic city .
i &apos;m in a tux . you want me babysitting ?
i &apos;m supposed to be your wingman .
i &apos;m trusting you with him .
that is being my wingman .
magnificent .
superb .
riveting .
outrageous .
insulting .
disgusting .
don &apos;t let it ruin your evening .
i ... i mean , i won &apos;t .
no .
i won &apos;t .
yeah .
i ... hey , asshole .
why don &apos;t you have a little more respect for the ...
oh , my god , it &apos;s you .
yes , it is i.
sergei baskov !
i profaned at you . i &apos;m so sorry .
no , no , no , please , you &apos;re defending the ballet .
i was defending the ballet .
our rehearsal space ...
two ballerinas sprained their ankles .
well , that &apos;s why katya didn &apos;t dance tonight .
of course .
sadly , yes .
the royal hall is beautiful , magnificent ,
but behind the scenes , they look with a blind eye .
well , if i may be so bold ,
please , it would be my honor
to right this wrong for you .
oh , i could not impose .
thank you so much though .
please , allow me to be your nutcracker
and join in the battle against the mouse king .
the mouse king .
well , in that instance ,
then i would be in your debt , mr ... light .
it &apos;s actually mr ....
wonderful .
thank you .
excuse me , i &apos;m terribly sorry .
you know what a napkin &apos;s good for , tommy ?
that &apos;s what a napkin &apos;s good for .
peter lawford called . he wants his tux back .
let me tell you something .
steven spielberg did a pre @-@ nup on a napkin .
didn &apos;t hold up ,
which is why amy irving is
the richest out @-@ of @-@ work actress in hollywood .
that &apos;s because his napkin didn &apos;t meet
the minimum requirements of a contract .
my client &apos;s does .
why did you ask me what exactly
was written on the napkin ?
cause no matter what it was written on ,
for a contract to be valid ,
it needs to have three things :
an offer , acceptance ...
and consideration .
what &apos;s consideration ?
quid pro quo .
you both get something .
like i get his chips and he gets my--
company . that is a valid
contract , yes .
you forgot one thing : competence .
my client was drunk , and you knew it .
do you have proof of that ? how many drinks did he have ?
i don &apos;t remember .
that &apos;s a good start .
well , here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen .
we &apos;re going to give you your money back
and throw in the $ 500,000 .
you would have gotten had keith won ,
and then we &apos;re never gonna hear from you again .
sorry .
my advisors tell me that that company &apos;s worth $ 30 million .
and i &apos;m keeping it .
well , when you show up to open the door with your napkin ,
it &apos;s not gonna fit in the lock .
so if he wants to take your company ,
he &apos;s gonna have to do it in court .
and then , you &apos;ll be playing at my table .
i need a list of everything that &apos;s wrong
with the rehearsal space .
for example , the creaky floorboards ,
they &apos;re affecting certain dancers &apos; attitudes .
they shouldn &apos;t let that get them down .
&quot; attitude &quot; is a pose .
yeah , like striking an attitude .
whatever , i do that all the time .
okay .
i also need a list of the ballet company principals .
okay , um , integrity , fidelity ,
patriotism ...
not that kind of principle .
okay , we &apos;re done .
how am i supposed to know ?
rachel , you &apos;ve just been drafted .
but she &apos;s not even a ...
not what ? she &apos;s not what , harold ?
ms. zane not only knows more about ballet than you do ,
she also knows more about law .
but ...
zip it .
my mind &apos;s been racing ever since we met sergei yesterday ,
so i dictated a to @-@ do list for you to handle .
i &apos;m on it .
okay .
jessica .
where are you ?
in a meeting .
do people often yell
&quot; i hit the jackpot &quot; in your meetings ?
if you know where i am , why are you asking ?
because the answer tells me i should be worried .
it &apos;s just poker .
harvey , i know losing donna &apos;s been hard .
i &apos;m fine .
you haven &apos;t hired her replacement .
she &apos;s irreplaceable .
i &apos;m assigning you a temp .
excellent .
not for you . you should fold .
damn it .
i swear i &apos;m listening .
no , no , the judge assigned to your fraud case
just denied our motion to seal .
what ?
that motion &apos;s a slam dunk , and we need it .
who &apos;s the judge ?
ella follman .
don &apos;t know her . you ?
i &apos;m about to . we &apos;re already being sued ,
but i guess she decided my headache wasn &apos;t big enough .
now come home before you wind up in trouble .
i &apos;m doing just fine .
i had nothing .
are you trying to impress me ?
with nothing ?
i don &apos;t remember you impressing that easily .
i don &apos;t remember being impressed at all .
i need copies of last night &apos;s poker room security footage .
i can &apos;t give you that .
yes , you can .
and you will .
thank you .
hello , jessica .
ella ... ella medeiros .
ella follman . married name .
i haven &apos;t seen you since ...
your little prank ?
oh , the things we do when we &apos;re young .
what can i do for you ?
you denied our motion .
i have to say , i &apos;d assumed it was a formality .
well , you know what they say about assuming .
ella ...
it &apos;s judge follman .
judge follman ...
these allegations are serious .
i know how serious they are ,
and i also know how important this case is to your firm .
then you also know that , until proven ,
they have no business being placed in public record .
i see what you &apos;re saying .
humiliating someone for no good reason doesn &apos;t seem fair .
do we have a problem ?
no , not at all .
i just happen to be of the opinion
that trials are about truth .
and truth requires openness .
rest assured , jessica ,
those who have done wrong will get what &apos;s coming to them .
there &apos;s one thing i &apos;m not clear on .
go through the security footage
and count the number of drinks keith had .
we establish his state of mind , then file a motion to dismiss .
how hard is that ?
not the thing i &apos;m unclear on .
i don &apos;t have time to explain where babies come from .
how exactly did you get this footage ?
head of security owed me one .
which brings me to my next question :
everyone always owes you one , but keith says you owe him one .
why ?
why don &apos;t you just ask him ?
i did . he wouldn &apos;t tell me .
exactly .
because if he had , i wouldn &apos;t owe him one anymore .
mr. specter , i &apos;m cameron , your new assistant .
where are my ...
messages .
urgent to normal , top to bottom .
i also took it upon myself to fan the folders
on your desk in alphabetical order .
wow , look at that , harvey .
he fanned your folders in an order of some sort .
i also reorganized your filing system
and redid your calendar .
ha , that is not going to be a problem at all
because harvey loves change .
it was a train wreck .
yep .
he &apos;s in mourning over your predecessor .
her filing system , her calendar--
it &apos;s probably best if nothing else
is different in there this morning , okay ?
mike ...
you might want to take an early lunch .
harold , can i get the rest of the files on the ballet case ?
sure , let me grab them for you .
thank you .
what is it about ballet ?
i just--i don &apos;t get it , you know ?
there &apos;s no words , there &apos;s no story ,
there &apos;s no action . it &apos;s just all ...
and ...
and like ...
i don &apos;t ...
please tell me that louis isn &apos;t behind me .
louis isn &apos;t behind you .
hi .
hi .
penelope cruz ,
zoe saldana ,
audrey hepburn .
what do they all have in common ?
they &apos;re all hot ?
no , dumbass .
they all owe their success to ballet
because it gives them discipline and grace .
it embodies our emotions .
it &apos;s breathtaking in its beauty , and most importantly ,
it expresses what cannot be put into words .
you want to get ahead here , harold ?
take ballet , because right now ,
the only thing that &apos;s breathtaking about you
can easily be put into words : nothing .
now releve your ass back to work .
i need everything you got for me first thing tomorrow .
i &apos;m on it .
good .
yes , immediately . thank you .
what happened with judge follman ?
there might be a slight problem .
what did you do ?
why do you assume i did something ?
what did you do ?
there was a prank .
how bad was it ?
we went to law school together , and i got her drunk .
so ?
so she woke up in front of the entire con law class .
it &apos;s recoverable .
she might have been naked .
&quot; might have &quot; ?
was .
we &apos;re screwed .
come on , harvey .
she was uptight . i just straightened her out .
it &apos;s what you do with uptight people .
why don &apos;t you ever do that to louis ?
i did .
that was you ? he blamed me .
you can be uptight sometimes too .
that &apos;s why i let him think it was you .
told him it was me .
that &apos;s what i said .
it &apos;s okay , i deserved it .
what ?
do you remember when he was so mad
when his cat peed in the corner of his office ?
mm @-@ hmm .
that wasn &apos;t his cat .
you know , this is no joke .
we &apos;re being sued . i &apos;m in trouble .
i know .
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna get her off our case .
you &apos;re studying up to break the house ?
counting drinks .
don &apos;t most people count cards ?
it &apos;s a think .
ah ! right there . you see that ?
drink number 15 .
your client ? that &apos;s awful .
no , no , no , it &apos;s good .
we &apos;re even putting him in rehab
to help nullify his contract .
touching .
harvey truly cares about his clients .
uh @-@ uh @-@ uh , my idea .
well , you &apos;re really coming along .
what are you doing here so late ?
working with louis .
i &apos;m sorry ? with louis ?
associate work .
he , um ... he replaced harold with me .
good for you .
looks like you &apos;re really coming along .
thank you , mike .
and that was the last drink of the night .
16 drinks in 11 hours
in a 180 @-@ pound man ,
and that &apos;s a blood alcohol level of 0.16 % ,
double the legal limit .
your honor , you &apos;ve heard the expression &quot; beer goggles . &quot;
well , when my client was looking at that dirty napkin ,
all he saw was angelina jolie .
your honor , my client entered into a contract
with a man that was aware enough to realize
that he had a good hand ,
aware enough to ask for help ,
aware enough to sign a piece of paper
for the sole purpose of winning a large pot of money ,
and now he &apos;s mad he lost .
our client has a history of drinking
and has agreed to be placed into rehab .
that has nothing to do with this .
that tape clearly shows that keith didn &apos;t
make any of those decisions while he was sober .
maybe not . but you did .
what ?
the next morning , you came to my client
and offered to pay him what you &apos;d owed him if you &apos;d won .
i don &apos;t care what he says
about his client &apos;s state of mind ,
he was stone @-@ cold sober .
which clearly demonstrates
they were perfectly happy with the terms of the contract .
your honor , those were settlement talks ,
not subject to disclosure here .
mr. specter , you &apos;re asking me
to dismiss this contract without a trial .
let &apos;s have it .
yes , i made an offer .
then i &apos;m sorry , counselor , i &apos;m not ruling for dismissal .
this goes forward to trial .
this guy is pissing me off .
yeah , he &apos;s really good . kind of inspiring , actually .
you trying to piss me off more ?
yeah , it focuses you . it &apos;s what you do to me .
yeah , i do that because you don &apos;t have
a natural killer instinct .
yes , i do .
good , because i need you to use it .
see what i did there ?
yeah . what &apos;s our end game ?
interim control of the company .
possession is nine @-@ tenth of the law .
whoever is in control in the interim
is likely to be in control in the end .
plus , if we &apos;re in the driver &apos;s seat ,
we can drag this trial out forever .
and we can do anything we want in the meantime .
by the time this is over ,
he won &apos;t even get back his $ 3 million in chips .
what do you need me to do ?
find out everything there is to know
about this tommy guy
and get his ass in here for a deposition .
on it .
louis , i finished .
you were here all night ?
you said you wanted everything by this morning ,
so here &apos;s everything on the lease agreements
and all of the financials .
oh , no , sergei waltzed me through the financials earlier .
did you know that he danced with nureyev ?
i did . um , also ...
i found this .
lead paint ?
okay , this is ... excellent .
you can use it ?
&quot; use it &quot; ?
we are gonna pas de deux all over their asses with it .
&quot; we &quot; ?
get out .
okay .
here to buy me a drink ?
that didn &apos;t go so well for me last time .
no . no , i &apos;m here same as everyone else ,
to contribute to your reelection campaign .
actually , i already did .
pearson hardman is now a platinum @-@ level donor .
go , follman .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
of course , you don &apos;t have to disclose this ,
and neither do we ,
but i am of the opinion that elections are about truth ,
and truth requires openness .
you think you can get me to recuse
by implying a conflict of interest ?
you know , i hadn &apos;t thought of that .
i &apos;ll simply return the money .
that is certainly your prerogative .
but it could look like you took money for favors
and then got scared .
no one forced liquor down your throat , ella .
you got drunk , we played a bad joke ,
but that was a long time ago .
you know , a man &apos;s reputation is at stake ,
and i &apos;m not joking with you now .
cheers .
lastly , section 5 , page 30 states
that the royal hall is responsible
for all maintenance and repairs of the rehearsal space .
i &apos;m aware of what the lease says , mr. litt ,
having drafted it myself .
okay , well , then how do you explain this ?
the royal hall &apos;s knowing failure to fix
the air conditioning system has created a toxic environment .
lead @-@ based paint .
see , your disregard for the safety of your charges
takes it from a tenant dispute to a criminal action ,
a fact that i will happily bring
to the attention of the district attorney
unless repairs are made yesterday .
then you &apos;ll be exposing the ballet itself ,
because the terms require they cover all repairs
from a special fund they stopped paying into a year ago .
no , no , no , no , payments have been going out every month .
then perhaps you should figure out
where they &apos;ve been going in because it &apos;s not here .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t understand .
our financial records say ...
mr. litt ,
we were willing to look the other way ,
but since you have come in here and threatened me ,
i &apos;m going to take legal action of my own .
we &apos;ll be filing for eviction .
it &apos;s time the ballet moves on .
can you tell me what this is exactly , mr. walsh ?
i don &apos;t know .
if i told you it was a yaw drive ,
would that mean anything to you ?
a yaw drive keeps the rotor facing the right way ,
even when the wind direction changes .
if you have a problem with this , you &apos;re not getting any power .
i &apos;m sorry , where exactly did you study engineering ?
i didn &apos;t .
but you &apos;re suggesting that you can run an energy company .
my client &apos;s gonna be running it ,
not designing parts .
well , does your client have any idea
how to protect the company from the numerous allegations
made by the jarvis homeowners association ?
are you even aware of these allegations ?
i haven &apos;t taken over the company yet , mr. specter .
well , let me explain something to you .
my client &apos;s company needs to remain viable
during the course of this trial ,
and these allegations are a threat to its very existence .
and i don &apos;t think someone who doesn &apos;t know the difference
between a yaw drive and a carburetor
is the man for the job .
he &apos;s right .
i don &apos;t know anything about energy .
and i &apos;ll tell you something else :
i also know very little about ice cream .
yeah , i mean , i enjoy vanilla .
but beyond that , nothing .
vanilla , i could &apos;ve guessed .
i assume you have a point .
i don &apos;t know anything about any of the company that i &apos;ve turn around .
but i don &apos;t have to .
because i hire experts
to advise me on operating them .
then one thing all the experts have in common
is that none of them has a drinking problem .
your honour--
he raised the issue .
his clent and i quote
&quot; has a history of drinking &quot;
and was in fact so intoxicated that night
that his own lawyers had to place him to rehab .
he disputed that .
that is not the subject of this hearing .
your honor , he &apos;s trying to--
i know what he &apos;s trying to do .
he &apos;s using your words against you .
but they are your words , mr. specter .
the issue of the napkin contract
will be heard at trial ,
but in the interim ,
thomas walsh will assume control of the company .
thank you .
this is just wrong .
i know , this ruling doesn &apos;t make any sense .
no , i meant this .
the hot dog is wrong ?
it &apos;s a truck .
this is new york .
i want a cart , a vendor , or a vague sense of danger ,
that the hot dog might be made of anything .
okay , well , i think i saw some cats lurking out behind the truck .
stop trying to make me feel better .
not so bad .
all right , street meat . you wanna talk about what just happened ?
no , i don &apos;t .
you said whoever &apos;s in control in the interim--
i know what i said .
so what &apos;s the other 1 / 10 ?
what are you talking about ?
you said possession is 9 / 10 of the law .
so i figure we need the other 1 / 10 , right ?
we &apos;re not gonna win this .
what ?
we don &apos;t have him .
it &apos;s a 10 % chance , but it &apos;s still a chance .
i &apos;m not talking about the odds . i &apos;m talking about the man .
i &apos;ve never heard you say another lawyer &apos;s better than you before .
he &apos;s not . he &apos;s just got a better hand ,
and he knows it .
what if we play a new hand ?
i &apos;m listening .
you &apos;re always talking about this gun being pointed at your head .
what if we take off our jacket
and show them that we have a bomb strapped to our chest ?
it &apos;s a metaphor , metaphor .
you wanted to see me ?
it was sergei .
he lied to me .
the money went into his account .
there &apos;s no way that you could have--
what , known ?
it &apos;s my job to know .
god , i never take anyone at their word .
you know i was eight years old when i saw him perform &lt; i &gt; the nutcracker ? &lt; / i &gt;
eight .
everybody else was into sports ,
and i was this rebel , gliding down my own path .
he inspired me . that &apos;s why i &apos;m so light on my feet .
i just can &apos;t do it to him .
i cannot do it to him , rachel .
he is the ballet .
no , the ballet is bigger than sergei .
it embodies our emotions .
it is breathtaking in its beauty ,
and most importantly , it expresses what cannot be put into words .
yes , but--
no buts .
the louis i know wouldn &apos;t be defeated by something like this .
he is ruthless .
he is mean .
and if someone wronged him ,
he wouldn &apos;t hesitate to tear them apart limb from limb .
you ruined everything .
i took your help and now we are evicted .
i would have ...
shut up sergei .
how dare you !
me ? you ,
you brought disgrace in my beloved ballet .
i am the ballet .
you were the ballet
and now you are done .
now the royal hall get paid .
how ?
i reorganized accounts and moved money ,
i did what i do .
i showed them how they can pay for everything
by eliminating your bloated salary .
the board would never agree .
sorry it &apos;s ridiculous .
shup up , that &apos;s why they are here , sergei .
it &apos;s not about the eviction .
they know you are done .
they want to see your face when they tell you that you are fired .
but i am giving you one chance
to avoid scandal .
my leaving is a scandal ?
your leaving is a gift .
take it before i change my mind .
you wanted to see me .
that was a good speech .
it got me right here .
the only thing is you said &quot; we played a joke . &quot;
there is no &quot; we . &quot; it was you .
you targeted me .
what do you want me to say ?
i was young , i was stupid ,
and i am sorry .
you were young and smart .
and i don &apos;t believe your &quot; sorry &quot; for a second .
because it was no accident
that the classroom you chose belonged to the professor
who was conducting the interviews
for the job we both wanted .
i had no idea .
you sabotaged me .
there were dozens of applicants
no , we both knew it was you or me .
i didn &apos;t know that he ...
objection .
bullshit !
what do you want , ella ?
i want to recuse myself
on one condition .
admit you know what you did .
i wanted that job .
i know what i did .
and i &apos;m not sorry i did it .
and i &apos;d do it again .
you look confused .
i am .
about what ?
i ... like louis .
trust me , i &apos;ve been there ,
doesn &apos;t last .
oh my god !
is that ... ?
is that louis &apos; dictator phone ?
oh ... yeah , i needed it to transcribe the note for the ballet case .
any idea what this means ?
rachel , this is the window into the mind of louis litt .
it &apos;s a dictator phone .
that he treats like his best friend .
mike ?
oh come on , we got to try .
note no. 7 , perfect the british accent .
hey it &apos;s top of the morning mate ,
would you like some tea and coffee ?
yes !
no no no no no , we really shouldn &apos;t .
no , i think we really really should .
go over the catchphrase .
injunctus .
hey harold , injunctus .
this is insane .
insanely awesome .
you just got laid up , excuse me missey .
you just got laid up .
no !
wait !
that &apos;s enough !
no , he just got laid up .
wait wait wait ...
you are dirty .
this is a gold mine . one more , come on .
they &apos;re settling ? you wanted that ?
wanted it ? i goddamn orchestrated it .
cm pays what they should have in the first place .
and the suit against us goes away .
and daniel hardman &apos;s none the wiser .
where the hell &apos;s donna ?
he recorded us .
he must have planted this in harvey &apos;s office .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s horrible .
that &apos;s why he turned on me .
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know . but if i tell harvey about this ,
he is gonna kill louis .
come on , let &apos;s go , they are in the conference room .
ok .
everything alright ?
yeah , did you get the power of the attorney ?
yeah , let &apos;s go settle their bum .
thanks .
by the way , where did you find that yaw drive anyway ?
pulled it out of the back of a photocopier .
gentlemen , as you are in control of the company ,
we thought it &apos;s best to brought your problem to your attention .
how selfless of you .
these are amended copies of allegations against your company
by the jarvos homeownders association .
nice try . i looked into those allegations
no single expert has backed one of their claims .
oh , one has now .
keith hoyt .
who is better to speak to the harmful effects
than the man who designed the wind farm himself .
no , if he goes through with this , that company goes out of the business .
there is no way he kills his own business .
you are right , he wouldn &apos;t . but i would .
as yourself pointed out , his judgement has been impaired lately .
so i convinced him to let me make the decision going forward .
i now have the power of attorney .
i rather see this company worth nothing
than let you have it .
this is bullshit .
let them finish .
something is coming .
we have three choices here .
we move forward with the suit . lose @-@ lose .
we can give your money back , plus 500,00 .
or , you and i can play poker for it .
and i &apos;m not giving you your money back .
are you crazy ?
you &apos;re gonna gamble a man &apos;s company ?
you &apos;re gonna gamble for 30 million dollars ?
it was your idea .
no , it was my idea to make him take the $ 500,000 .
but it &apos;s not $ 500,000 . it &apos;s $ 3.5 million .
why give him that when i could take it for free ?
okay
but let me take it .
what ? a minute ago , you were ready to fold .
what are you gonna do if he goes all in ?
harvey , i know the odds of every card in every hand before it &apos;s even dealt .
pick a card in your mind , any card .
okay , what , now you &apos;re gonna tell me what the card is ?
i &apos;m gonna tell you what it isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s not one of the 52 cards in a deck
because you think you &apos;re smarter than me .
it &apos;s a baseball card or football card or ...
it &apos;s the joker .
i told you this before . i &apos;m gonna tell you again .
i don &apos;t play the odds . i play the man .
well , let me tell you one thing .
what ?
louis bugged your office .
he heard our whole conversation about tanner &apos;s lawsuit .
and then he ran , and he told hardman .
you just saying that to make me mad , so i can focus ?
wanted it ? i goddamn orchestrated it .
cm pays what they should have in the first place .
and the suit against us ...
you aren &apos;t the only one who can play the man .
you really think you can handle me ?
oh , i think i &apos;ll be just fine .
&apos;cause this isn &apos;t sunday afternoon bridge with your grandmother .
i don &apos;t see how that &apos;s an insult to a person .
i &apos;ll just keep dealing .
look , we &apos;re supposed to play until one of us is busted ,
even if it takes all night , but you know what ?
i don &apos;t have all night .
who &apos;s the grandmother now ?
better .
he can &apos;t help you .
but i do know why you &apos;re looking to him .
you see , i looked into you .
you say you &apos;re a self @-@ made man .
your ex @-@ wife had a different story
when she told me why she left you .
she said you had a chip on your shoulder
because everything you ever got came from daddy .
now , you may not think this is true anymore .
you said yourself , you &apos;re not an expert .
but you hire them to advise you ,
run your companies , and fight your battles .
tonight , it &apos;s you , me , and that stack of chips .
let &apos;s play .
you think you can bait me into calling you ,
when you got me beat ?
you &apos;re gonna have to do better than that .
you &apos;re right , tommy ,
i do have you beat .
but these shity cards ,
they don &apos;t have anything to do with it .
after that , he was on tilt , never recovered .
took me 20 minutes to bust him .
are you out of your goddamn mind ?
how fast did you want me to beat him ?
that &apos;s not what i meant , and you know it .
you &apos;re out of control .
i &apos;m fine .
fine ? let me connect the dots for you .
donna &apos;s gone .
you took mike to a casino ,
and two days later , you &apos;re gambling with a client &apos;s $ 30 million company .
i wasn &apos;t gambling . i was playing poker .
harvey , save it .
save it ?
gambling is what you do when you &apos;re playing against the house
and hoping to get blackjack .
i &apos;m playing against people ,
and against people , i win .
in a back room card game , that might be true ,
but you didn &apos;t know anything about this guy .
he could &apos;ve been phil ivey for all you know .
you &apos;re gonna beat phil ivey ?
no , i did know , and i was right .
this time .
but you know what else gambling and what you did have in common ?
this .
you think i didn &apos;t remember your
&quot; life is this , and i like this &quot; speech ?
when you get that from your job , it &apos;s one thing ,
but then you start chasing it .
no , i wasn &apos;t chasing it .
we were going to lose this in court .
then lose .
no ! i am not--
you &apos;re not what ?
a human being ?
we &apos;re people , and sometimes we lose .
sometimes ?
look , i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i feel like that &apos;s all we &apos;ve been doing lately .
hardman &apos;s back , donna &apos;s gone , we &apos;re being sued--
i mean , we &apos;re fighting for our goddamn lives here .
i just had a huge win ,
and i am not in the mood to hear why it might have turned out as a loss .
harvey ...
you &apos;re right .
we are being sued ,
and our backs are against the wall ,
and i need to know
that this bullshit is out of your system
and that you can focus .
can you do that ?
i &apos;m focused .
i was--
i don &apos;t give a shit what you were doing .
you know , harvey , you can make fun of me all you want , but
watch your tone .
what the hell is that ?
that &apos;s not yours .
this is a violation of my privacy .
you know what , i have a right to know what &apos;s going on at this firm ,
just as much as you .
okay .
did you tell jessica ?
there &apos;s gonna come a day , louis ,
when i need something from you ,
and when i do , you &apos;re gonna remember that i let this pass .
daniel hardman is not the answer .
