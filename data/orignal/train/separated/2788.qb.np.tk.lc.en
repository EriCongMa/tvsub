the man &apos;s been captain of a cereal for 40 years .
what ?
the spoon ! you licked and you put .
you licked and you put .
yeah , so ?
don &apos;t you see how gross that is ? it &apos;s like you using my toothbrush !
you used my toothbrush ?
only because i used the red one to unclog the drain .
mine is the red one !
oh , god ! can open . worms everywhere !
why can &apos;t we use the same toothbrush ...
... but we can use the same soap ?
because soap is soap . it &apos;s self @-@ cleaning .
the next time you shower ...
... think about the last thing i wash and the first thing you wash .
the one where joey moves out
look at you fancy lads !
what &apos;s the occasion ?
you know that guy on my show that &apos;s in a coma ?
he &apos;s having a brunch .
ready when you are .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re actually getting tattoos .
you guys are getting tattoos ?
but you cannot tell ross because i wanna surprise him .
wow , this is wild ! what are you gonna get ?
i &apos;m getting a lily .
for my mom , because her name &apos;s lily .
that &apos;s lucky . what if her name was big ugly splotch ?
where you getting it ?

what &apos;s on your shoulder ?
a chip .
i &apos;ve got a big attitude problem .
a tattoo . i &apos;m getting a tattoo .
a tattoo ?
why ? why would you wanna do that ?
you don &apos;t think they &apos;re kind of cool ?
no . sorry , i don &apos;t .
why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life ?
what if it doesn &apos;t come out right ?
it &apos;s like having a bad haircut all the time .
why is everyone staring at me ?
sign this card for dad . richard will be here soon .
richard &apos;s going to the party too ?
he &apos;s my parents &apos; best friend . he has to go .
so is today the day you &apos;ll tell them about you two ?
yeah , for my dad &apos;s birthday , i decided to give him a stroke .
no , i think you should tell them .
i don &apos;t know how serious he is . until i do , i won &apos;t say anything .
i don &apos;t think mom and dad would mind .
remember when you were 9 and richard was 30 , dad said ...
... &quot; god , i hope they get together . &quot;
hello ? .
i &apos;m double @-@ parked ,
okay . come on , ross .
bye , you .
bye .
bye , you .
here we go . here we go . here we go.okay , wait , wait .
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
are you not nervous ? .
i &apos;m terrified.this is just a very absorbent suit .
shall we ?
yes
you know what ?
ross , let &apos;s switch places . you get in the middle .
this looks like we &apos;re trying to cover something up .
you could come in straddling him , they still wouldn &apos;t believe it .
we &apos;re here !
hi , kids !
the children !
happy birthday , dad .
thank you .
happy birthday !
so you kids thanked dr. burke for the ride ?
actually , mom , i think monica thanked him for the both of us .
so you kids take the train in ?
no , richard burke gave them a ride .
speaking of whom ...
... i hear he &apos;s got some 20 @-@ year @-@ old twinkie in the city .
finger cramp ! oh , god !
sorry . here , let me get that , mom .
so richard &apos;s shopping in the junior section ?
are we still on that ?
you just know she &apos;s got the lq of a napkin .
she &apos;s probably not even pretty .
just young enough so that everything is still pointing up .
can you believe this place ?
i know . this is a great apartment .
in the bathroom there &apos;s mirrors on both sides of you .
when you &apos;re in there , it &apos;s like peeing with the rockettes .
well , there &apos;s my fantasy come true .
seriously .
we were just saying , great apartment !
thanks . you want it ?
i &apos;m moving to a bigger place .
you should take this one .
can you see me in a place like this ?
why not ? you hate park views and high ceilings ?
come on , i &apos;ll show you the kitchen .
that &apos;s all right , i saw a kitchen this morning .
on tv .
stop talking . okay !
come on , tell us !
ls she really 20 ?
i am not telling you guys anything .
come on , it &apos;s my birthday . let me live vicariously !
dad , you really don &apos;t want to do that .
what &apos;s a little midlife crisis between friends ?
would you let it go ?
i know what you &apos;re going through . when i turned 50 , i got the porsche .
you got your own little speedster .
seriously , it &apos;s not like that .
tell you what .
maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and i could
dad , i beg you not to finish that sentence !
what ? i &apos;m kidding !
you know i &apos;d never let him touch the porsche .
okay , rach .
which lily ? this lily or that lily ?
well , l
i like this lily .
it &apos;s more open and that &apos;s like my mom .
she had a more open , giving spirit .
foghorn leghorn !
blonde girl ? you &apos;re in room two .
not @-@ so @-@ blonde girl , you &apos;re with me .
here we go !
you &apos;re not going .
is this because of what ross said ?
well , yeah , maybe .
i don &apos;t believe this .
is this how this relationship works ? ross equals boss ?
come on , what is this , 1922 ?
what &apos;s 1922 ?
just , you know , a long time ago .
when men used to tell women what to do a lot .
then there was suffrage , which was a good thing . but it sounds horrible .
do you want this tattoo ?
yes , i do . it &apos;s just that ross
is your boyfriend the boss of you ?
who is the boss of you ?
you ?
you are the boss of you !
you march in there and get that heart tattoo on your hip !
go !
i haven &apos;t even gotten my tattoo and i &apos;m already tougher .
how you doing ?
i &apos;m a twinkie !
really ? i &apos;m a hero .
this is so hard .
yeah , i know . i hate it too .
look , maybe we should just tell them .
maybe we should just tell your parents first .
my parents are dead .
god , you are so lucky !
i mean well , you know what i mean .
just hang in there , okay ?
okay , i &apos;ll go out first , all right ?
judy ! going to the bathroom . good for you !
thank you , richard . i appreciate the support .
honey .
seen my harmon kille brew bat ? bob doesn &apos;t believe i have one .
i have no idea .
did you know richard has a twinkie in the city ?
i know . he &apos;s a new man . it &apos;s like a scene from cocoon .
i just never would have pictured richard with a bimbo .
he told johnny shapiro that she &apos;s quite a girl .
he told johnny that he thinks he &apos;s falling in love with her .
really ?
i &apos;ve never seen him this happy .
so , jack ...
... ever think about trading me in for a younger model ?
of course not .
with you , it &apos;s like i &apos;ve got two 25 @-@ year @-@ olds .
oh , jack , stop !
come on !
it &apos;s my birthday !
can we drop this ?
i am not interested in the guy &apos;s apartment .
oh , please . i saw the way you were checking out his moldings .
you want it .
why would i want another apartment ?
i &apos;ve already got an apartment that i love .
it wouldn &apos;t kill you to say it once in a while .
all right . you want the truth ? i &apos;m thinking about it .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m 28 . i &apos;ve never lived alone ...
... and i &apos;m at a place where i got enough money ...
... that i don &apos;t need a roommate .
i don &apos;t need a roommate either .
i can afford to live here by myself .
i may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware .
why are you getting so bent out of shape ?
we didn &apos;t agree to live together forever .
we &apos;re not bert and ernie .
i &apos; m aware that we &apos; re not gay puppets , all right ?
you know what ?
if this is the way you feel ...
... then maybe you should take it .
that &apos;s how i feel .
then maybe you should take it !
maybe i will !
fine with me !
great !
you can spend more quality time with your real friends ...
... the spoons !
whose drink can i freshen ?
almost time for cake !
mon , are you okay ?
you remember that video i found of mom and dad ?
well , i just caught the live show .
hey , there .
what ?
nothing . i just heard something nice about you .
really ?
your son isn &apos;t seeing anyone , is he ?
not that i know of .
i was thinking , why doesn &apos;t he give monica a call ?
that &apos;s an idea .
well , actually , i &apos;m already seeing someone .
oh ?
she never tells us anything .
ross , did you know monica &apos;s seeing someone ?
mom , there are so many people in my life .
some are seeing people and some aren &apos;t .
is that crystal ?
so who &apos;s the mystery man ?
well , he &apos;s a doctor .
a real doctor ?
no , a doctor of meat .
of course he &apos;s a real doctor .
and he &apos;s handsome .
and he &apos;s sweet , and i know you &apos;d like him .
well , that &apos;s wonderful .
mom , it &apos;s okay .
it is , judy .
jack !
could you come in here for a moment ?
now !
found it !
i &apos;ll take that , dad .
it seems your daughter and richard are something of an item .
that &apos;s impossible . he &apos;s got a twinkie in the city .
i &apos;m the twinkie .
you &apos;re the twinkie ?
she &apos;s not a twinkie !
look , this is the best relationship i &apos;ve been in
oh , please ! a relationship ?
yes , a relationship !
for your information , i &apos;m crazy about this man .
really ?
am i supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday ?
this is a good thing . you said you &apos;ve never seen richard happier .
when did i say that ?
upstairs in the bathroom , right before you felt up mom !

i can &apos;t use these forever . they &apos;re no friend of the environment .
no , i mean what &apos;s this about your new place ?
i &apos;m moving out , like we talked about .
i didn &apos;t think that was serious .
you know , i thought that was just a fight .
well , it was a fight ...
... based on serious stuff , remember ?
about how i never lived alone or anything ?
i think it would be good for me . help me to grow ...
... or whatever .
well , there you go .
