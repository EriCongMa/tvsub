my name is elena gilbert , and i &apos;m a vampire .
i &apos;m learning how to survive , but there are complications .
you &apos;re sired to me , elena .
everything that you think you feel
might not even be real .
but there &apos;s hope now .
tell them what the hunter
told you the tattoo leads to .
he said there was a cure .
everyone wants it for a different reason .
for revenge ...
to be human and in love ...
for the truth ...
i &apos;m setting you free , elena .
aand some will stop at nothing to get it .
do it !
carol lockwood always said that togetherness
in times of tragedy ,
leads to healing .
that one community is stronger than a thousand of its members .
but how does a community stay strong
after losing its leader ?
and carol was so much more than just a mayor .
she was ...
an open @-@ minded friend ...
and a concerned mother ,
taken from us too soon
by a terrible accident .
screw this .
what ?
tyler .
tyler .
please join me in observing
a minute of silence in her memory .
you ok ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
thank you very much .
in the wake of this tragedy ,
the town has selected an interim mayor .
many of you already know him .
please welcome mr. rudy hopkins .
thank you , sheriff .
carol lockwood put this town first ,
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m here to talk to you guys .
you folks ...
april ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i &apos;m fine .
but you &apos;re crying .
it &apos;s just the whole mayor thing .
you know , it &apos;s bringing up stuff with my dad .
and i know you &apos;re a vampire .
wait . what ?
was that necessary ?
no , but it was fun .
you just missed the mandatory all @-@ school assembly .
that &apos;s because i &apos;m at a mandatory all @-@ alone drinking party .
seriously ? you decided to go on a ripper bender now ?
my brother slept with elena .
kind of puts a little bit of a damper on things .
first of all , you are not supposed to know that .
second of all , tyler is already spiraling ,
and he gets priority .
his mother just died . what do you expect ?
i &apos;m his girlfriend . i expect him to talk to me .
but instead he &apos;s all angry ,
and it doesn &apos;t help that everyone keeps referring to
his mother &apos;s death as an accident ,
which is really just a polite way of saying that she was drunk .
you think klaus killed her ?
i don &apos;t think she drowned in a martini glass .
just get it together . i can &apos;t do it alone .
the assembly &apos;s over .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
the school will be empty soon .
how many times did you compel me ?
don &apos;t-- just don &apos;t lie .
rebekah says you lie .
rebekah &apos;s not who you think she is , april .
what , she &apos;s not a thousand @-@ year @-@ old original vampire ?
listen , we can figure this out , ok ,
but we have to get out of here .
sorry . not allowed .
why don &apos;t you take a seat ?
the rest of the class will be here shortly .
first saved message .
it &apos;s me .
look , i know why you sent me away .
you think that what i &apos;m feeling for you
is because of the sire bond ,
but i hate not being near you .
go ahead . make a move .
i drove up here to be your wingman , not kick your ass .
ok .
i get it . i get it .
you &apos;re a badass .
you see that ?
couldn &apos;t miss it . it was in slow motion .
then teach me something useful .
we &apos;ve been here for days , and so far
all you &apos;ve done is bark orders .
ok .
take a seat at the bench , quarterback .
karate kid wants a shot at the title .
jeremy , you &apos;re not ready for this .
well ?
now , all i have to do is apply
a little pressure under your jaw .
really ? again ?
double pepperoni 3 days in a row .
you guys eat anything else ?
why ? are you offering ?
a little something extra ,
cut off the pizza pipeline for a couple days .
no matter how much they beg , don &apos;t come back .
sorry , guys .
you &apos;re gonna starve us now ?
if that &apos;s what it takes to make you a hunter .
now run around the lake , twice .
keep him company .
i don &apos;t have to listen to you .
you do if you want to eat .
... being near you , and i miss you . damon
i wish you would just let me come to you .
what ?
guess who .
i &apos;m back , dagger @-@ free ,
and i &apos;m holding elena hostage at the high school .
just thought you should know .
who the hell was dumb enough to pull that dagger out of you ?
i &apos;ll be asking the questions today .
see ya soon .
i am only ready to talk to you if you &apos;re ready to rejoin civilization .
how would you like to
drive the white oak stake through rebekah &apos;s heart ?
if it means you &apos;re not
drinking your way through the mystic grill , sure .
so ...
first speech under your belt .
now for the fun part .
welcome to the world of careful cover @-@ ups .
we &apos;ve ruled carol &apos;s death as head trauma from a fall .
that &apos;s the official autopsy .
she did not go gently , did she ?
any leads ?
we have ideas .
let me guess .
sharp teeth and bad table manners ?
you sure you want this ?
i mean , 6 people were offered this job before you .
they all said no for a reason .
i &apos;m saying yes for a reason ,
and my reason just walked in .
i &apos;ll let you know what we find .
thank you , sheriff .
hey , sheriff . hey , dad .
so ...
far cry from being a traveling pharmaceutical rep .
i noticed a few of your friends missing from the assembly .
so much for mandatorat i guess , huh ?
dad , stop it .
you can &apos;t come in here and start making rules .
i think this town could use a few more rules .
you &apos;re forgetting i can help protect the town .
i am well aware of your gifts , bonnie ...
but don &apos;t forget i &apos;m your father .
that means that i get to protect you .
一楼 我去吸引她注意力 你用木桩捅她
hello , stefan .
i &apos;m here . what do you want ?
the same thing i wanted when you helped make klaus stab me .
the cure .
i hope you &apos;re not waiting for caroline to show up
and stake me ...
because i already found her .
stefan .
did i say you could move ?
class is in session .
you &apos;ve all been compelled . you know the rules .
answer my questions honestly ,
no disobedience ,
no one leaves .
april , my sweet , take notes .
this is how you get answers in this town .
let &apos;s start with a little quiz .
in the year 1114 , my brother learned-- thanks to yours truly--
about a brotherhood of vampire hunters
with tattoos that grew with each kill .
and these tattoos reveal what ? elena ?
a map .
which led to , caroline ?
a cure for vampirism .
perfect . we &apos;re all caught up .
stefan salvatore , the last time we saw each other ,
you had a vampire hunter ,
but in order to decode the map ,
you needed the location of the hunter &apos;s sword ,
which you got out of me using some very dirty tricks .
assuming you found the sword ,
you must have found the cure ,
and yet you &apos;re all still vampires ,
which means something went wrong .
what are you doing ?
you asked me to take notes .
i wasn &apos;t being literal , darling .
but now that you mention it ,
a flow chart would be nice ,
which means index cards and push pins . go fetch .
you &apos;re wasting your time .
we don &apos;t know anything .
so you just gave up ?
i thought you &apos;d do anything to save elena ,
even if it meant taking the cure yourself
so you could grow old and die with her .
why do you look so surprised ?
i &apos;m missing something . what is it ?
they broke up , ok ?
now let us go .
broke up ?
wait . i &apos;m confused .
i thought elena was your epic love , stefan .
i asked you what happened ,
and you have to tell me .
she slept with damon .
good .
now ...
now do it like your life depends on it &apos; cause it does .
don &apos;t act like you care about my life .
you care about the hunter &apos;s mark and curing elena
so she &apos;s not sired to your ass .
both require you to be alive ,
which is why i &apos;ve updated our relationship status to
&quot; it &apos;s complicated . &quot;
you talked to her at all ?
elena ?
maybe .
why ? runing out of voicemails to listen to ?
i &apos;m sorry . did i interrupt play time ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
i &apos;m simply appreciating the sights and smells of nature ,
neither of which presently include rotting vampire flesh ,
so i &apos;m a bit concerned .
how many vampires has he killed ?
if we throw jeremy out into the world right now , he &apos;s chum .
now , see , that &apos;s not a number .
12--that &apos;s a number .
that &apos;s how many of my hybrids i slaughtered with my sword .
3--that &apos;s how many days it took
to quell the urge to kill your brother ,
after he knowingly watched as i walked into a death trap .
one ...
that &apos;s the number of purposes you serve .
you are here to grow jeremy &apos;s mark ,
so i ask again ...
how many vampires has he killed since he &apos;s been here ?
zero .
that &apos;s a pity .
i &apos;m going to need that cure
sooner rather than later ,
hybrid shortage and all .
how can i help ?
you know ...
now that you mention it ,
jeremy ... watch and learn .
that &apos;s for carol lockwood .
so , vampire elena is a trollop who likes bad boys ,
which explains why stefan reeks of alcohol .
but what it doesn &apos;t explain is why sweet , loving ,
innocent elena could be so heartless towards stefan .
how could she hurt you like that ? answer , please .
she didn &apos;t know it at the time ,
but she was sired to damon .
a sire bond . fascinating .
and what do you think about that , elena ?
i think you &apos;re sad and bored
and in desperate need of a hobby .
you &apos;re hiding something . &apos; fess up .
i didn &apos;t sleep with damon because of his sire bond .
i slept with damon because i &apos;m in love with him .
what does any of this have to do with the stupid cure ?
you &apos;re right . we got off the point .
stefan , how do i find the cure ?
unless you &apos;d rather talk about damon and elena all day .
there &apos;s a professor . he knows where the cure is .
thank you . and , uh , where do i find this professor ?
oh , and so now i &apos;m &quot; gifted &quot; ?
he hates my witch heritage .
that &apos;s why he travels all the time .
he can &apos;t handle it .
and suddenly he wants to be a protective father ?
no . not like this .
come on . distract me .
isn &apos;t there some ...
magic therapy thing you haven &apos;t shown me yet ?
listen , bonnie , i hate to tell you this--
actually , you know what ? i take that back .
i &apos;m proud to tell you this .
you don &apos;t need my help anymore .
in fact ...
i was hoping to present this with a cupcake or something .
happy graduation .
it &apos;s beautiful .
it &apos;s human bone .
legend says it was worn by the 2,000 @-@ year @-@ old witch qetsiyah ,
who drew on it ... for strength .
bonnie , you have come so far so fast .
if you trust my opinion ,
your magic is exactly where it needs to be .
does this mean i have to go home now ?
it means i got a stack of papers i got to grade by tomorrow .
i can take a hint .
thanks , shane .
oh , my god .
kol .
shane ?
i told you i don &apos;t want to talk .
i heard . you &apos;re keeping all that rage
bottled up inside .
caroline &apos;s worried sick about you .
rebekah ?
hello , tyler .
i heard my brother made a real mess of your life .
believe me , i can relate . you have my condolences .
in fact , why don &apos;t you come down to the high school
so you can accept them in person ?
and why would i do that ?
because i have your girlfriend .
maybe you have a better shot at saving her than you did your mother .
bye now .
sister ...
look at this .
you &apos;re even worse than klaus .
kol . finally .
did you bring me what i asked for ?
you must be shane .
if you &apos;re here for payback , go for it .
but you &apos;ll be stuck baby @-@ sitting the little hunter that could .
you know ...
if you adjust your angle a little bit ,
you &apos;ll find a sharper edge .
i know how to whittle . thanks .
now i know why those hybrids hated you .
you are annoying .
actually , i &apos;m just perplexed
as to why jeremy hasn &apos;t killed any vampires .
darwinism , klaus .
he needs to be able to protect himself
before we hunt down his first vampire nest .
and here was i , thinking you were the fun brother .
well , let &apos;s play a little game , shall we ?
jeremy needs more victims ,
and there &apos;s a whole town of people down the road
just waiting to be turned into vampires for the slaughter .
you don &apos;t think that occurred to me , klaus ?
the tragedy is , damon ,
it did occur to you , yet you chose to ignore it .
and my guess is you did it to impress elena .
somehow , to honor her , you &apos;ll find a way
to spare innocent lives
and walk jeremy down the moral high road .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve already made the necessary corrections .
what did you do ?
don &apos;t tell me he ordered another pizza .
no , i &apos;m just an idiot .
i ran out of gas and my phone &apos;s dead .
think i could use yours ?
yeah , come on in .
i &apos;ll run upstairs and grab my cell .
what the hell ?
what are you doing here ?
car drama .
your friend just went to go get his phone .
well , i &apos;m about to go take a shower ,
but you &apos;re more than welcome to wait inside .
thanks .
kol ...
and rebekah mikaelson ,
two members of the original vampire family .
this is such a trip .
where &apos;s the cure ?
compulsion won &apos;t work .
it &apos;s a little trick i picked up in tibet .
right . well , we &apos;ll just have to do this the old @-@ fashioned way .
beat him until he tells you where to find it .
still glued to your seats ?
ooh , it &apos;s thick with tension in here .
let &apos;s spice things up a bit .
elena , truth or dare ?
we &apos;re done playing your stupid games , rebekah .
truth or dare , elena ?
you &apos;re compelled . answer .
dare .
i dare you to tell stefan the truth about damon .
seriously ?
being with damon makes me happy .
makes you happy ?
clowns make you happy , elena .
dig a little deeper .
when i &apos;m with him ...
it feels unpredictable , like ...
like i &apos;m free .
and how do you feel when you &apos;re with stefan ?
stop .
she can &apos;t . she &apos;s compelled .
lately , i feel like i &apos;m a project ,
like i &apos;m a problem that needs to be fixed .
i think i make him sad .
and i can &apos;t be with someone like that
because ...
when he looks at me , all he sees is a broken toy .
do you still love stefan ?
yes .
are you still in love with stefan ?
no .
did that hurt ,
having someone you love drive a dagger through your heart ?
go to hell .
did ... that ... hurt ?
yes .
welcome to the last 900 years of my life .
ah , good , you &apos;re here . it was just getting depressing .
what the hell is going on ?
listen to the rules carefully .
stay in the building . no vamp @-@ running in the hallways .
vamp @-@ running from what ?
turn .
what ?
you can &apos;t . he &apos;ll lose control .
that &apos;s the whole point .
i &apos;ve exhausted all your knowledge .
now i have the professor to help me find the cure ,
you &apos;re just competition .
whoever finds it first gets to decide what to do with it :
use it , share it , destroy it , save it ...
i want that to be me .
but if i turn , i &apos;ll kill them .
yes , you will .
turn .
did you find your phone ?
bonnie ?
how did you know everyone was here ?
who &apos;s everyone ? i came to find shane .
did you do a gps magic locator spell or something ?
rebekah told me that you &apos;re a witch .
rebekah ? what the hell is going on ?
rebekah has stefan , elena , and caroline compelled .
she &apos;s getting them to actually tell the truth for a change .
what ?
shane can &apos;t be compelled .
she &apos;ll have him torture him to find out what he knows .
what are you looking for ?
i need salt .
i think i just saw some .
what are you doing ?
if this pendant will connect me to shane ,
then i can do a protection spell .
where is the cure ? !
where is the cure ?
you &apos;re human . why do you want it anyway ?
that &apos;s the beauty of this .
you can have it . i just want silas .
no .
what do you know about silas ?
he &apos;s the world &apos;s first immortal being ,
who just happens to be imprisoned with the cure .
and i want to free him .
no !
april ?
what &apos;s happening ?
stop !
he &apos;s of no use dead .
did you not hear what he said ?
silas will kill us all , sister .
silas does not exist .
he is a fairy tale
made up to scare children into eating their vegetables .
silas is very real .
i know where he &apos;s buried ,
and soon i &apos;ll have the spell that wakes him .
wait a second . you &apos;re lying .
you can &apos;t get to him ...
without his tombstone ?
dozens to die in a blood sacrifice ?
believe me , i know , i &apos;ve done it .
those massacres are a pain to engineer .
you &apos;re the one who got the council blown up .
it was a noble sacrifice ...
and temporary .
because once i raise silas ,
silas will raise the dead .
he will bring back every last soul who died on his behalf .
no !
oh , my god !
i can fight it .
aah ! get out of here !
go .
that door &apos;s not gonna hold him .
you should be thanking me .
you killed my only chance at finding the cure .
silas on the loose would be hell on earth .
and frankly , sister ...
i don &apos;t think you could handle it .
how did you get that ?
way too easily .
bonnie .
help ! someone help !
bonnie , what &apos;s going on ?
she needs help .
what happened ?
i did a protection spell
but it accidentally linked shane to april .
and you couldn &apos;t control it ?
i didn &apos;t even know i was doing it .
usually i feel pain or i bleed ,
but this time i just felt more power .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
you &apos;re ok . you &apos;re ok . you &apos;re ok .
bonnie , get her out of the school .
just be careful . tyler is out there , and he turned .
what about you ?
no , we can &apos;t leave . rebekah &apos;s compelled us .
just go . we &apos;ll deal with her later . come on .
stefan ...
no .
stefan , we have to talk about this , please .
talk about what , huh ?
how many more ways are there for you to rip my heart out ?
i &apos;m sorry .
sorry that it happened , or sorry that i found out ?
i &apos;m sorry about all of it .
i &apos;m really sorry , stefan .
i didn &apos;t mean to hurt you . i didn &apos;t want that .
why are my least favorite people always the most durable ?
tyler ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
it wasn &apos;t your fault .
yes , it was .
this whole thing .
it &apos;s all my fault .
no .
i should have saved her .
leave her out of this .
this is between me and you .
you &apos;re still protecting her ?
must i rip your bleeding heart from your chest
and show you the scar tissue that is elena gilbert ?
there &apos;s a solution to all your problems , you know .
i could compel him ...
erase every memory he has of you .
every day you &apos;ve spent together ,
every kiss , every lie , every ounce of pain .
i can take away every bit of love he has for you .
give you both a clean slate .
just say the word , and i &apos;ll make you
and all that misery you &apos;ve caused him disappear .
do it .
excuse me ?
erase it all . every memory .
stefan , no .
i said do it .
no . that would be far too easy .
i refuse to make you forget her the way klaus made you forget me .
but at least you know how he really feels .
consider your eternity of pain my revenge , stefan .
i &apos;ve used you for all you &apos;re worth .
so now you &apos;re free to go .
stefan , wait .
turns out i miscalculated .
kol &apos;s gonna be a problem .
i almost killed someone ,
and that &apos;s what you miscalculated ?
april could &apos;ve died today .
that &apos;s only because you didn &apos;t know the extent of your abilities .
my father just became mayor .
i can &apos;t be out doing black magic .
that &apos;s not what expression is .
then what is it ?
it &apos;s a way of doing magic that isn &apos;t monitored by nature or the spirits .
it isn &apos;t good nor bad .
but it also has no limits .
so how you use it is up to you .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m here for ...
to help you .
bonnie , listen to me . you are the key to everything .
i &apos;m not going to let anything bad happen to you .
hope your day is going better than mine .
got to say , i &apos;m liking the odds .
stefan knows about us .
how &apos;d he take it ?
how do you think ?
i &apos;m thinking , for the first time all week ,
i &apos;m happy to be at camp nowhere .
how &apos;s jeremy ?
that depends on how much you trust me .
you know that i trust you .
then i think he &apos;s gonna get through this thing just fine .
thanks for looking out for him .
yeah , well , i told them if they were good ,
i &apos;d buy them both ice cream , so i got to go .
not yet .
something happened today .
i realized something about you , about us .
and you can say that it &apos;s the sire bond ,
and you know what ? maybe--maybe it is .
but i &apos;m telling you it &apos;s the most real thing
that i &apos;ve ever felt in my entire life .
i love you , damon .
i love you .
look .
i &apos;m going to get this cure for you .
and i &apos;m gonna have to do things you don &apos;t like .
damon--
but listen carefully .
get in your car right now .
come to me .
i &apos;ll be there soon .
you let yourself in .
you called me .
should i be checking for hidden daggers ?
do you still want to find the cure ?
more than anything .
i want to ram it down niklaus &apos; throat
and look into his eyes as he realizes he &apos;s mortal again .
but shane &apos;s dead and you are useless ,
so i &apos;m right back where i started .
shane &apos;s not dead .
but i watched kol impale him .
well , you probably shouldn &apos;t have left him alone .
bonnie did a little spell .
he &apos;s perfectly fine .
you didn &apos;t have to tell me that .
why am i really here ?
you were right .
i &apos;m gonna be here for an eternity ,
and i will go insane if i don &apos;t know how elena truly feels
about my brother .
if you really want the cure ,
you should know that shane has an agenda ,
and it &apos;s a dark one .
he said he organized dozens of people to die in sacrifice .
he admitted to the council explosion where 12 people died ,
and i &apos;m guessing it &apos;s not a coincidence
that 12 hybrids died at the hand of my brother .
12 ...
channeling the energy from a mass death is used
in witchcraft to perform dark spells .
it &apos;s called expression .
shane admitted all this to you ?
proudly .
well , then i guess we &apos;ll have to figure out how to manage him
while we find the cure for ourselves .
&quot; we &quot; ?
there &apos;s no &quot; we , &quot; stefan .
listen , i hate my brother , and you hate yours .
but damon &apos;s got jeremy , and klaus has the sword ,
and shane has bonnie .
you and i are the only ones left with nothing .
you said it yourself , right ?
whoever finds the cure first
gets to decide what to do with it .
what do you say ? you want to be partners ?
my father had no reason to kill 11 people .
he had no reason to kill himself .
he loved me .
he loved mystic falls .
he was brainwashed into sparking that fire .
professor shane organized his death
and the 11 others who died with him .
it &apos;s time this entire town started telling the truth .
i was beginning to worry
you boys wouldn &apos;t find the place .
what the hell ... ?
did you kill all these people ?
not exactly .
they &apos;re in transition .
killing them is your job .
you said you were going to convince klaus to do this another way .
i thought about it .
and then i realized his idea was better .
