someone has to call frank and alice .
my mom might ... joey , what are you doing ?
i &apos;ve got to get the &quot; before &quot; shot !
the one with the triplets aka the one hundredth
we spoke to the nurse .
the reason your doctor is late ... is because she &apos;s not coming .
she hit her head in the shower .
oh , my god . she &apos;s so stupid !
phoebe , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i don &apos;t see three kids coming out of your vagina !
listen . the nurse said the doctor is wonderful.he &apos;s head of the department .
all right . oh , dear god , save me !
i &apos;m having my first contraction !
oh , it &apos;s not bad .
and so the miracle of birth begins . and l

am i late ? nobody came out yet , right ?
no , we haven &apos;t started yet . where &apos;s alice ?
delaware . until she gets here , i &apos;ll be your coach .
don &apos;t worry . she told me about the lamazda stuff .
if you get the babies out by month &apos;s end ... you get two percent financing .
ya
monica , you &apos;re gonna be very proud of me.i just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses .
oh , my !
they &apos;re male nurses.not in my head .
they want to take us out saturday night ! what do you say ?
i don &apos;t think so .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;ve been telling me to get over ross and move on .
i &apos;m moving on and so are you.why don &apos;t you want to go ?
why don &apos;t you give me a good reason ... and i &apos;ll tell you if it &apos;s true .
what ?
harder than it sounds , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;re coming . and when they get off ... we &apos;ll go get some jello with them .
there &apos;s always room for jello .
how do you make that dirty ?
it &apos;s easy . i can do it with anything .
grandma &apos;s chicken salad ....
get a shot of this .
these are the headlines when you were born .
now , girl baby , turn away . and boy babies ...
... check it out ! this is what naked women looked like when you were born .
now let &apos;s dive into the good stuff .
okay , i &apos;m having another one !
this one doesn &apos;t hurt eith yes , it does !
i was kind of hoping that was it .
where are monica and rachel , anyway ?
a couple of nurses asked them out .
really ? male nurses ? yeah , i was bummed too .
so they &apos;re going on dates.when ?
i think saturday .
what &apos;s with him ?
sympathy pains .
it was sweet at first , but now i think he &apos;s trying to steal my thunder .
let &apos;s see what we got here .
oh , you know , fonzie dated triplets .
this fonzie person you keep referring to ... is that another doctor ?
oh , no , no.fonzie is the nickname of arthur fonzerelli .
the fonz .
all right .
it &apos;s not that weird , is it ?
it &apos;s very weird !
i don &apos;t want some guy down there telling me i &apos;m &quot; dilated @-@ a @-@ mundo . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t seem to be impersonating fonzie
what are you doing ? why are you defending him ?
just get me another doctor who isn &apos;t crazy and doesn &apos;t fonzie !
again , it &apos;s not
hey , there you are !
there &apos;s something you should know .
is this about you dating the nurse ?
joey told me.i am so fine .
you and l , we &apos;re just nothing.just goofing around .
i was about to tell you i was getting out of it .
but if we &apos;re just &quot; goofing around , &quot; maybe i will go out with him .
fine . maybe i will too .
hey ! look what i found in the gift shop .
get up ! get up ! get up !
phoebe , this is dr. oberman .
he has no strong feelings about fonzie ... or any of the happy days gang .
you &apos;re going into what grade ?
i &apos;m actually a first @-@ year resident . i graduated early .
me too .
i should have specified i &apos;d need a grown @-@ up doctor .
really , i &apos;m fully qualified ... -doogie !
doesn &apos;t anybody understand that i &apos;m going to be having babies soon ?
go , little boy ! go !
oh , cool . you made him cry !
mr. tribbiani , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve got kidney stones .
well , what else could it be ? it &apos;s kidney stones .
or .... kidney stones .
lf it was something else ?
well , that would be &quot; kidney stones . &quot;
you &apos;re getting there .
these babies are very , very lucky.they are ? why ?
they &apos;ll be born on the fonz &apos;s half @-@ birthday .
happy birthday .
just to clarify ... i &apos;m not fonzie .
it &apos;s a terrific thing that you &apos;re having these babies for frank and alice .
no , it is .
can i tell you a secret ?
i want to keep one .
oh , i &apos;m gonna be on the news .
you must be kidding.you know you can &apos;t keep one of these babies .
maybe i can . you don &apos;t know .
i do . frank and alice will want to keep all their children .
maybe not . you know ?
three babies are a handful.maybe they &apos;ll want to unload one .
i hate to miss an opportunity because i didn &apos;t ask .
phoebe , no . this is insane .
just ask him.what ? me ?
i can &apos;t ask him ! do you know how inappropriate that would be ?
all i &apos;m saying is , just talk to frank.just feel him out .
no . i will not ask frank to give you one of his kids .
you &apos;re right .
tell him it &apos;s for you .
feeling better , sweetie ? maybe a little .
wish you hadn &apos;t seen me throw up .
me too .
i just heard . what &apos;s up ? kidney stones !
ordinarily , we try to break the stones up with shock waves.but they &apos;re too close to the bladder .
either we wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra
no , no , no , no . nothing is going up , okay ? up is not an option .
what &apos;s a urethra ?
are you crazy ?
did you ask him ?
no , i haven &apos;t had a chance yet .
i &apos;m kind of on a clock here .
oh , fonzie .
you know who i always liked ? mork .
undo it . undo it .
fonzie met mork.mork froze fonzie .
yes , but
but fonzie was already cool .
so he wasn &apos;t hurt . right ?
yeah , that &apos;s right .
how you doing ? okay . doctor says any minute now .
you know , alice is going to be here so soon.you couldn &apos;t just do me a favor
and , like , hold them in ?
sorry , i &apos;m in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do .
rachel

would you like to see them ?
they &apos;re so small .
i &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
great .
are you really going to date that nurse man ?
you and i are just &quot; goofing around . &quot; i thought , why not &quot; goof around &quot; with him ?
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve looked up &quot; goofing around &quot; in the dictionary .
well , i have ... and the technical definition is :
two friends who care a lot about each other ...
... and have amazing sex ...
... and just want to spend more time together .
but if you have this new dictionary that gets you mad at me then we have to get you my original one .
i am so bad at this .
you &apos;re better than you think you are .
really ?
okay . so if ?
know when to stop .
i sensed that i should stop .
so we &apos;re okay ?
ya
i &apos;m gonna go tell dan that it &apos;s not gonna happen .
don &apos;t do the dance .
right .
you &apos;re my favorite .
which one do you have ?
i don &apos;t care .
frank and alice want me to tell you they &apos;re making phone calls .
did you talk to them about , you know ....
no , honey .
okey
it was a long shot .
you guys ? can i just have a second alone with the babies ?
oh , ya
so here you are .
seems like yesterday i was talking to you in that petri dish .
everyone said labor was the hardest thing.but they were wrong . this is .
well , i had the most fun with you guys .
i wish i could take you home and see you every day .
i &apos;ll settle for being your favorite aunt .
i know alice &apos;s sister has a pool , but you lived in me .
okay , so we &apos;re cool .
we &apos;re gonna be great .
little high @-@ fives .
well , if you &apos;re going to cry ....
phoebe , we are so proud of you . you &apos;re amazing !
i know .
does it hurt as bad as they say ? you won &apos;t be able to take it .
now that little chandler is a girl , what &apos;ll they name her ?
they &apos;ll call her chandler .
kind of a masculine name , don &apos;t you think ?
it works on you .
maybe they can girlie it up a bit , like chandlerette .
alice called her channy @-@ fanny .
