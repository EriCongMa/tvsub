help me !
hello ?
help me . please help me .
can anyone hear me ?
i can &apos;t breathe .
help me . i can &apos;t breathe .
i need a doctor . you ...
i &apos;m really sick .
there &apos;s a doctor in room 209 .
good boy .
there &apos;s one more .
hold it . what do you got ?
we found something .
离奇死亡依然无解
i mean , losing someone &apos;s bad enough ,
but imagine not having any answers .
you &apos;re right , that &apos;s terrible .
but we haven &apos;t been invited , and it isn &apos;t serial .
that &apos;s just the thing , see ? i think--
i think it &apos;s connected to this other case .
红衫区附近发现尸体残骸
how many small @-@ town newspapers do you subscribe to ?
38 . it used to be more ,
but a lot of them disappeared .
you mean gone digital .
same thing .
see , that was 6 weeks ago and it wasn &apos;t in vicap .
you haven &apos;t been sleeping , have you ?
i can &apos;t . there &apos;s too much work to do .
i agree with reid .
we &apos;ve got a serial on our hands .
10 days ago , joseph purl ,
a 33 @-@ year @-@ old logger ,
was found just outside rapid city , south dakota .
to be exact , the dismembered body parts of joseph purl
were found in the woods outside of rapid city , south dakota .
local p.d. believes his body had been there about a week
before a hiker found them ,
but he &apos;s not the first victim .
the first victim--
oh--squeeze it .
it gets stuck sometimes . do you want me to take over ?
no , i got it .
ok . yeah , maybe you better .
i have it memorized ,
so i don &apos;t have to look at the gross .
the first victim is raymond nava ,
31 , originally from texas .
he was a seasonal truck driver for a logging company .
his dismembered body was found within the border
of the pine ridge indian reservation ,
which is 60 miles south of rapid city .
so nobody else was able to make the connection
between the two victims ?
nava &apos;s under tribal and local fbi jurisdiction ,
and purl &apos;s rapid city , p.d. ,
the two agencies never spoke .
they &apos;re speaking now ,
thanks to the good doctor .
but p.d. says that the bureau investigation
of nava has been lacking .
would you call that a slam or a bitch slap ?
is this still blowback of leonard peltier ?
the government &apos;s been accused of ignoring crimes
on the reservation since &apos; 75 .
well , peltier did kill two fbi agents
who were searching for a robbery suspect .
it &apos;s hard to forget .
so , what do we know about these cases .
well , we know that two bodies
were found within a hour &apos;s drive of each other .
we know there &apos;s no evidence of robbery or sexual assault .
and according to the decomp reports ,
nava was killed two weeks before his body was found .
so , the disposal sites are remote ,
and / or the unsub is very good at hiding the parts .
oh , the , uh , parts
were dispersed within a quarter @-@ mile radius ,
and it &apos;s unclear whether the unsub did that
or it was scattered by animals .
then the bites and scratches on purl
could be scavenger activity .
yeah , but if animals had access ,
why aren &apos;t we just looking at bones ?
good question . my guess is that
there was a toxin in the flesh
that probably repelled them .
these circles on his back are definitely manmade .
it reminds me of the marks you get from cupping in holistic therapy ,
except the diameter &apos;s too wide .
are they lividity marks ?
it &apos;s tbd on the prelim m.e. report .
there &apos;s really not a lot here on either case .
which is why we need to start from the beginning .
let &apos;s head to south dakota .
hey , man , don &apos;t forget ,
devil &apos;s tower on sunday .
i &apos;ll pick you up 0900 . better be ready .
excuse me .
i know this is weird , but ...
would you mind walking me to my car ?
i &apos;m probably being paranoid ,
but there &apos;s someone i &apos;m scared of running into alone .
sure .
this is me .
well , i think you &apos;re safe .
my ex has a real bad temper .
i &apos;ll probably never stop looking over my shoulder .
anyway , thank you .
no worries .
you &apos;re not from around here , are you ?
how &apos;d you know ?
well , first there &apos;s your haircut
and your weird clothes ,
and then there &apos;s your funny accent .
i &apos;m kidding . it &apos;s the rental car keychain .
good one .
where are you staying ?
the gantry motel .
that place is a dump .
i &apos;m the manager of the red creek lodge .
it &apos;s real nice .
i &apos;ll give you a room , no charge .
you don &apos;t have to do that .
i want to , as a thank @-@ you for being so gallant .
all right . thanks .
i &apos;m tess .
chad .
thermostat is there .
there &apos;s extra pillows in the closets .
ok .
hey , uh , are you sure that you can give me this room ?
i told you , i &apos;m the manager .
i can do what i want .
and right now i don &apos;t want to be alone .
&quot; dreams are true while they last ,
and do we not live in dreams ? &quot;
alfred , lord tennyson .
both of them were close in age , both tall ,
around 180 pounds , fair complexions .
they had to be surrogates for someone .
except , given the physical demands of logging ,
that description could apply to a majority of men in the area .
so , was someone trying to get back at the industry ?
hacking them apart means the anger ran deep .
reid , you ok ?
yeah .
there &apos;s no shortage of enemies to the logging industry ,
from climate change environmentalists
to animal rights activists .
native americans with longstanding territory disputes .
maybe this is all to create a hostile working environment
for the logging companies .
it looks like both men disappeared overnight .
they left work one day , didn &apos;t show up the next .
garcia , did anyone interview family members ?
no . the families didn &apos;t know anything
&apos;cause they were all back at home .
raymond nava was in texas ,
and joseph purl &apos;s from wyoming .
are a lot of the workers seasonal or itinerant
like the two victims ?
yeah . they either live in work camps provided by the companies
or they rent rooms .
jj , you and blake go to the morgue .
morgan and i will go to the crime scene .
and , reid , since you &apos;ve already made contact ,
you and dave talk to the local fbi
and find out what &apos;s holding up the investigation .
dr. reid . i &apos;m agent stern .
actually , this is dr. reid .
i &apos;m ssa rossi .
are you the sra for the pine reservation ?
yep . i &apos;ve been working with detective landry ,
who &apos;s out at the purl crime scene right now .
let me show you what we got .
is this it ?
no offense , but are you like incredibly busy here
in rapid city , south dakota ?
&apos;cause the last i checked ,
you guys had like the fifth lowest crime rate in the country .
i just--i feel like the victims &apos; families deserve more .
let me explain something .
when i go out on the reservation asking questions about a homicide ,
i &apos;m not exactly greeted with open arms .
you add a non @-@ resident victim to the mix
and they close ranks ,
thinking i &apos;m trying to find a native to pin it on .
i think we understand .
and the body was found on reservation land ,
but it may not be tribal related .
the area where we found nava ,
that &apos;s easy to access from the highway .
it &apos;s possible the unsub knew it was a different jurisdiction
and took advantage of it .
we found a torso here .
a leg about 100 yards that way .
the rest of the parts strewn about
a quarter @-@ mile past that .
we found a foot not far from a known wolf den .
you think the wolves moved the parts ?
well , they &apos;ve staked out this territory .
it &apos;s not an easy hike from the road .
the strength it would take to dismember a body and carry the pieces
suggests that the unsub is a physically fit male
or it was a team .
you say it &apos;s a known wolf den ?
how many people might know about it ?
well , it &apos;s not common public knowledge .
local rangers and law enforcement ,
plus the biologists who are out here studying them .
what about animal activists ,
people who think that logging
might be infringing on the wolf habitat ?
yeah , we have a few .
i suppose they would have known about it .
it &apos;s not we &apos;re hiding the information .
here you go , mr. dumont .
thank you .
so , uh , where &apos;s tess ?
she works nights . but she left word you &apos;re a vip .
so what brings you to rapid city ?
just hiking , sightseeing .
great . we have brochures in the lobby
for mt . rushmore , deadwood , devil &apos;s tower .
hey , if you don &apos;t mind my asking , are you famous ?
we don &apos;t get many vips .
i &apos;m just a friend of tess &apos; .
oh . well , enjoy your breakfast .
thanks .
a wise man would avoid the badlands today .
storm &apos;s rolling in .
right .
you &apos;re a little jumpy .
that guy was just giving me the creeps .
sometimes this whole place gives me the creeps .
you &apos;ve only been here a month . you &apos;ll learn to ignore it .
by the way , the vip isn &apos;t famous .
he &apos;s just a friend of tess &apos; .
i told you .
i thought she was married to some invalid .
she is .
i wonder if her hot friend is just a friend ?
what ?
i &apos;m just sayin &apos; .
follow my lead .
as long as the check &apos;s clear ,
just ignore everything around here .
c.o.d. was solanine poisoning .
it was used to control the victims
while they were being held captive .
solanine is a potent toxin and hallucinogen .
it comes from a black nightshade plant .
the unripe berries were used in the middle ages for torture .
the effect it has is like a bad acid trip .
that &apos;s not fun . trust me .
more recently it &apos;s been used in small doses for asthma .
are we looking for someone in the medical community ?
more like an herbalist or a shaman
versus a traditional m.d.
the m.e. said the circular marks were premortem
and the victims were held around 48 hours .
this could be about torture .
if it is , the unsub &apos;s a sadist ,
or he wanted something from the victims .
joseph purl &apos;s body parts were left near a wolf &apos;s den .
petitions to protect the wolf habitat
have been circulating recently .
garcia &apos;s reviewing those names .
it may be an animal activist who &apos;s taken his beliefs to the extreme .
it could be native american , given the first disposal site .
the circular marks on joseph purl seem almost ritualistic .
any chance this is part of a tribal tradition ?
lakota shamans are well known
for their extended rituals in healing ,
as well as herbal remedies .
one thing doesn &apos;t make sense .
it took a while to find these victims .
if the unsub wanted to send a message to the logging industry ,
why hide them ?
why not leave them out in the open for the world to see ?
did you miss me ?
what do you think ? come in .
sorry , uh ...
man , i must be coming down with something .
i &apos;ve been kind of feeling woozy all day .
oh , no .
well , lucky for you , i &apos;m a naturopathic healer .
i know just the thing for you .
good morning .
how are you feeling ?
better .
that treatment you gave me , it worked wonders .
and what we did afterwards wasn &apos;t too bad either .
here , drink this .
it &apos;ll help get all the toxins out .
your ex @-@ boyfriend do that ?
you know , if you &apos;re so scared of him ,
then why don &apos;t you just move away ?
my little boy is buried here .
i can &apos;t leave him .
i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
i gotta get moving today .
i &apos;m meeting a friend of mine .
don &apos;t !
i have sensitivity to light .
please close the curtains .
i have an autoimmune disorder .
my own body is attacking my eyes .
well , uh ... are you getting treatment for it , or ...
herbal remedies help ,
but i deserve the pain .
why do you say that ?
it started after adam , my little boy , died .
we should have saved him .
you know it was our fault .
the company hasn &apos;t had any direct threats recently .
a coworker of raymond nava said the guys usually partied
at a different work camp every night ,
depending on who had the moonshine .
were there outsiders at these parties ?
they had an open @-@ door policy .
apparently things got pretty wild .
hey , mama . tell me something i don &apos;t know .
oh , hot chocolate , the things i could spill to you ...
hey , hey , you &apos;re on speaker .
... that would help you solve this case .
i have scoured all of my lakota shaman sources
and there isn &apos;t a single healing ritual
that would cause those circular marks to appear .
what about the petitions the animal activists were circulating ?
yes , i checked and double @-@ checked and cross @-@ checked all the names
and all the checks cleared .
what about that list of herbalists and naturopaths in the area ?
yeah , and give me a raise , &apos; cause i found the one guy
who was charged with solanine poisoning , and it was 7 years ago .
i &apos;m sending you his name and address now . there it is .
all right , blake and i will check it out . thanks , garcia .
we have a missing man who fits the same physical description
as the other two victims .
chad dumont &apos;s 33 .
he &apos;s an air force captain from ohio , here on leave .
well , he &apos;s not a logger . that changes things .
this can &apos;t be about animal activists and territory .
and there &apos;s probably no connection to the native american community ,
though someone wants us to believe that there is .
his voicemail message to his best friend
was his last known contact .
hey , man , don &apos;t forget , devil &apos;s tower on sunday .
and i &apos;ll pick you up 0900 . better be ready .
his friend said he never showed .
since he was military , dumont always punctual .
do we know where he was staying ?
gantry motel , according to his friend ,
but the thing is , he checked out
the same night he left that message .
can you play the message again ?
yeah .
hey , man , don &apos;t forget , devil &apos;s tower on sunday .
is that a bell ?
better be ready .
it sounds like they &apos;re in a bar .
dooley &apos;s on fifth rings a bell
whenever somebody leaves a big tip .
yeah , i talked to him .
he wasn &apos;t interested then .
what can i say ? some guys have bad taste .
undoubtedly .
did you happen to see where he went after you spoke to him ?
i assume he left .
how long are you in town for ?
uh ... not long enough , i &apos;m afraid .
too bad . we could have had some fun .
who was that ?
that was the fourth mrs. rossi if i &apos;m not careful .
she hit on chad when he was here ,
but he turned her down .
well , i just got off the phone with chad &apos;s sister .
he was a real stand @-@ up guy .
he took care of his family after their father died .
he got promoted quickly in the air force .
well , we know he checked out of the motel after he left the bar ,
even though he had the room reserved for two more nights .
now , that only makes sense if he met someone here .
well , if that &apos;s not his type , who is ?
a guy ?
if he was gay , his family and best friend would know about it .
and don &apos;t forget about the use of poison .
so , the unsub is a woman .
his ideal would be not too aggressive ,
less flashy .
demure .
given his family history and career choice ,
he &apos;s comfortable in the protective role .
what if someone appealed to those instincts ?
that means we &apos;re looking for a damsel in distress .
it was a mistake .
i made solanine for someone who asked for an organic pesticide .
i had absolutely no idea that
he planned to murder his neighbor &apos;s dog with it .
and you never made it again ?
i learned my lesson . paid my fine , did my time .
are there other naturopaths in this area ?
only 3 who really knew herbs .
can you tell us who they are ?
no problem .
excuse me .
yeah .
could i see one of the cups you use for this therapy ?
sure .
you think this is what caused those marks on joseph purl &apos;s back ?
the cup &apos;s the right diameter .
it &apos;s wider than what i &apos;ve seen before .
you know , the victims have the same coloring and build .
is this all about fertility ?
we believe that the unsub that we &apos;re looking for
is a woman who &apos;s trying to get pregnant .
she &apos;s experiencing what we call black widow maternal desire .
she has a desperate need for a child ,
which most likely stems from the recent loss of one .
that child may have died
or been taken away in a custody situation .
she &apos;s drugging her male victims
in order to keep them under her control for 48 hours ,
and we believe she &apos;s using them as breeding partners
to help replace the child that she lost .
her victims are surrogates for a male figure in her life ,
one she may have already killed .
he could be a boyfriend or husband
who most likely fathered the child she lost .
and the signs of torture indicate that she may blame
the child &apos;s father for this loss
and is exacting her revenge on these victims .
after they are dead , she dismembers them for easier disposal .
the strength required to do this and transport body parts ,
it &apos;s likely that she &apos;s working with a submissive partner
she dominates with her agenda .
based on the sophistication
and patience required for these crimes ,
we believe this unsub is probably in her 30s
and no older than her early 40s .
if pregnancy is her goal .
and she works at night ,
luring victims from parties or bars .
she may even have an illness or feign one to gain their sympathy .
jack dumont &apos;s been missing for almost 30 hours ,
and if the unsub keeps to her schedule , he may still be alive .
but time is of the essence .
even though the first two victims are dead ,
we can certainly step up our game
so we can give the victims &apos; families some answers .
thank you .
something weird &apos;s going on .
i heard sounds in room 209 .
so ?
it &apos;s supposed to be empty .
do you know anything about it ?
no .
oh , my god , you do .
is this place haunted ?
don &apos;t know and don &apos;t care ,
as long as i &apos;m left alone .
tess &apos; friend didn &apos;t come down for breakfast .
maybe it &apos;s connected to him .
he checked out last night .
come get me .
did i ever tell you about my uncle sal ?
he liked to fix up old cars .
when my aunt rosie died ,
he bought a 1947 buick .
well , it was a piece of junk , really ,
but he was obsessed with it .
he &apos;d work on it day and night ,
forgetting to eat ,
until it was a thing of beauty .
then one day , it got stolen .
when the cops found it ,
it had been completely vandalized .
uncle sal was devastated .
never recovered .
he died about a year later .
i &apos;m sorry about your uncle .
i &apos;m sorry about maeve .
so how long has it been now , 4 months ?
3 months and 15 days .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re not sleeping .
this can &apos;t go on .
i realize that the socially acceptable amount of time
to wallow in grief is coming to an end , and--
that &apos;s not what i mean .
you wallow as long as you need ,
but talk to someone .
i feel like there are two types of people
in this world , rossi .
the ones that get over their grief and move on
and the ones that descend into some sort off endless misery .
i know how you feel .
give it time .
how much time ?
i thought by coming to work every day
and helping other people , the pain would lessen , but it hasn &apos;t .
compartmentalization works only so long .
don &apos;t be like uncle sal .
you know that i remember every single word we ever said to each other ?
finally , the downside to an eidetic memory .
listen ...
spencer ...
if you want to feel better ,
you can &apos;t control the process .
you have to let yourself grieve .
i &apos;m not sleeping because when--when i do ,
i dream of maeve .
and when i see her , i feel the sweetest relief imaginable .
she always asks me to dance ,
but i can &apos;t because i don &apos;t know how to dance ,
and because i never even got to touch her when she was alive .
i know if i get into that fantasy , i &apos;ll be lost forever ,
so i force myself to wake up .
is that part of normal healing ?
ok , so let &apos;s not forget that all of the men ,
including the latest , were from out of town .
they all lived in temporary spaces ,
none of which were the ritz .
if the unsub lured these men away with a promise of sex ,
they probably went to her place .
but chad dumont checked out of his motel .
i mean , how many guys would do that first before a one @-@ night stand ?
almost none . they &apos;d want a place to retreat to .
all right , well , what if she offered them something
other than or in addition to sex ,
like another hotel room ?
yeah , this town caters to tourists ,
so there &apos;s no shortage of lodging .
so we may be looking for a woman who owns or works at a hotel .
no i.d. on her yet .
prints aren &apos;t in the system ,
and no one matching her description has been reported missing .
the body parts are pretty close together this time .
the unsub was in a hurry or didn &apos;t make an effort
to spread them out like she did before .
plus the m.o. &apos; s different .
female victim without mutilation or circular marks .
well , it can &apos;t be an evolution . she wouldn &apos;t go
from large men who are difficult targets to an easier one .
maybe this victim just got in the way .
that would explain the lack of ritual markings .
she didn &apos;t generate the same emotional response in the unsub .
maybe her partner did this one alone .
not hiding the body as well means it &apos;s someone less detail oriented .
i &apos;d say the partner &apos;s a male .
any chance that this is the unsub ?
no , no . she &apos;s way too young .
but we &apos;re definitely looking for a male / female couple .
dr. reid .
i was going through
old tribal enforcement records for the past 20 years ,
basically minor violations
the reservation handled internally without the fbi .
did you find something ?
12 years ago , a non @-@ native was given permission
to stay on the reservation
to study medicinal herbs with an old shaman .
he was kicked out when they suspected
he was trying to poison another student with solanine .
what was his name ?
roger whitcomb .
there &apos;s no listings for him anymore in the area .
thank you .
garcia , there &apos;s a name i need you to check out .
why are you doing this to me ?
because i ... i have no choice .
do you know what real pain is ?
that ... hollow ache ,
that gaping hole
that comes from senseless tragedy .
no , you don &apos;t .
you live in blissful ignorance ,
like all the happy @-@ go @-@ lucky people
who have no idea that darkness is a whisper away .
you remind me of steven ,
my ex @-@ boyfriend ,
with that stupid smirk on your face .
no .
you should have been looking out for adam
instead of lying your cheating ass off .
i &apos;m not your ex .
i &apos;m not steven .
please ...
please , i need a doctor .
please , i beg of you .
you said the unsub &apos;s partner is probably a boyfriend or husband .
so is he catching her sleeping with other men
and tortures and kills them out of jealousy ?
i buy that happening once ,
but anything beyond that , she &apos;s complicit .
if her child died , this could be pathological grief at work .
what have you got , garcia ?
i got a whole lot of nothing on roger whitcomb .
it &apos;s like he must have left the area ,
&apos;cause there &apos;s zilch after aught @-@ 1 .
secondly , there are 82 hotels , motels ,
inns , and b &amp; bs
in the area that are female managed or owned .
any of those who &apos;ve lost children ?
yeah , there &apos;s two of them , but there &apos;s nothing hinky .
there is , however , one woman with a deceased child
whose husband owns a hotel .
her name is tess mynock , and she does fit our profile .
she &apos;s 38 . her 5 @-@ year @-@ old son adam died 3 years ago .
and our first victim was killed the very same week
at the anniversary of her son &apos;s death .
she could be our unsub . the death of the child the stressor ,
the recent anniversary the trigger .
her husband owns the red creek lodge
on farmington road .
let &apos;s go .
hang on .
we &apos;re almost there .
calm down .
calm down .
it &apos;s all gonna be fine .
it &apos;s all gonna be fine .
garcia , what else do we know about tess ?
we know that the father of her dead son is steven colson .
he &apos;s an ex @-@ boyfriend , an abusive one at that ,
based on a police report .
he left her after their son died and he moved to florida .
according to an article , he and tess
were having a lakeside picnic with their son ,
they got in an argument ,
they didn &apos;t notice that the boy had wandered off , and he drowned .
drink .
it &apos;s ok . i &apos;m a doctor .
it &apos;s time to kill steven now .
this is odd .
the most recent info i can get on raoul whalen
is from 2002 .
any chance he &apos;s actually roger whitcomb ,
the guy who was kicked off the reservation ?
well , it &apos;s like raoul didn &apos;t exist
until 6 months after whitcomb disappeared .
it &apos;s gotta be the same guy .
disposing of the first
victim on the reservation may have been payback .
if he murdered someone there 12 years ago ,
he &apos;s not the submissive partner in the relationship .
and he &apos;s resourceful enough to run a hotel ,
which means he can appear to function normally .
a classic sociopath .
he always had a murderous impulse .
he took advantage of tess &apos; grief
and was able to fulfill his homicidal fantasies .
curious and curiouser .
so , uh , raoul was a naturopath , and then 10 years ago ,
he bought the inn with money he got from an inheritance .
he still has a website that he sells his natural remedies on ,
and according to his bio ,
he cured himself of prostate cancer .
and there is a testimonial from a tess m. ,
diagnosed with uveitis in 2010 .
she can &apos;t handle sunlight , and she says
that without his remedies , she would be blind .
it could be psychosomatic ,
a reaction to her son &apos;s death if it was sunny the day he died .
maybe tess met raoul when she sought treatment for her disease .
she didn &apos;t become homicidal till he entered her life .
they hit it off and became a killing duo .
let out your anger .
you &apos;ve wanted to do this for so long .
what happened to amber ?
don &apos;t worry . i took care of her .
you killed her ?
she saw too much .
but amber was harmless .
don &apos;t be naive . she would have turned us in .
you never said we would kill innocent bystanders .
i ...
i want to leave now .
not until you take care of steven .
remember what he did to you .
he &apos;s only getting what he deserves .
i can &apos;t do this anymore .
oh , darling , that &apos;s not the deal we made .
don &apos;t you remember ?
you were a wreck when we met .
no home , no money , no food ,
and a dead son to boot .
you were dying and i saved your life .
i made an honest woman out of you ,
and i took care of you . wasn &apos;t i generous ?
i even allowed you to take lovers
so you could get pregnant again .
but you must abide by the rules .
you must kill your lovers to protect the sanctity of our vows .
didn &apos;t you agree to that ?
only because you told me this would work .
but i &apos;m still not pregnant .
shh ...
you don &apos;t know that yet .
look ...
oh , my god .
has this all been a lie ?
you &apos;ve been manipulating me .
you ...
you turned me into a monster .
my poor baby .
he &apos;s never coming back .
enough !
kill him .
now .
fbi . drop the knife .
he slept with my wife .
he &apos;s still alive . we need paramedics .
she &apos;s not here .
where &apos;s tess ?
