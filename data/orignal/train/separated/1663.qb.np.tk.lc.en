hey , leonard , check this out .
leonard , she &apos;s doing it again .
i think it upsets sheldon when you play with the food .
no . it upsets sheldon when she willy @-@ nilly takes it
from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution .
this is essentially why you have famine in india .
you want me to put it back ?
leonard .
it upsets sheldon when you play with the sheldon .
what &apos;s up , my nerdizzles ?
raj , sheldon ,
i want you to meet my girlfriend bernadette .
hello .
leonard , penny , you know my girlfriend bernadette .
bernadette , say fo &apos;shizzle to my nerdizzles .
i don &apos;t think i can .
i don &apos;t have howard &apos;s street cred .
i hope it &apos;s all right--
i told my girlfriend bernadette
she could join us for dinner .
sure . the more , the merrier .
wa-- no , that &apos;s a false equivalency .
more does not equal merry .
if there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now ,
would we be celebrating ? no , we &apos;d be suffocating .
sheldon ...
don &apos;t &quot; sheldon &quot; me .
we ordered for five people , not six .
oh , come on , it &apos;s fine .
we &apos;ll just put it all on the table , you know , family style .
oh , sure . and while we &apos;re at it , why don &apos;t we put our hands behind our backs ,
have an old @-@ fashioned eating contest ?
relax , it &apos;ll be fine . sit down , you guys .
no ! no ! no !
what ? !
oh , yeah , you can &apos;t sit there .
why not ?
that &apos;s where sheldon sits .
he can &apos;t sit somewhere else ?
no , no , no-- you see , in the winter ,
that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he &apos;s warm ,
yet not so close that he sweats .
in the summer , it &apos;s directly in the path of
a cross @-@ breeze created by opening windows there and there .
it faces the television at an angle that isn &apos;t direct ,
so he can still talk to everybody ,
yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted .
perhaps there &apos;s hope for you after all .
ooh , i love your shoes .
oh , thanks .
they are cute , aren &apos;t they ?
where &apos;d you get them ?
shoes for less .
i &apos;ve been meaning to go over there .
oh , great selection , great prices .
my mother was right . hell is real .
come on , sheldon .
let the womenfolk chat .
womenfolk ?
gals ?
chicks ?
utero @-@ americans ?
just eat your dinner .
don &apos;t take him too seriously .
a lot of what he says is intended as humor .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s very funny .
me neither , but he just lights up when i laugh .
howard , never let her go .
so , leonard , howard says you &apos;re working on
fundamental tests of quantum mechanics .
i am .
are you interested in physics ?
oh , i find it fascinating .
if i hadn &apos;t gone into microbiology ,
i probably would have gone into physics .
or ice dancing .
actually , my tests of the aharonov @-@ bohm
quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point .
right now , we &apos;re testing the phase shift
due to an electric potential .
that &apos;s amazing .
yes . leonard &apos;s work is nearly as amazing
as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels .
while i appreciate the &quot; oh , snap , &quot;
i &apos;m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear .
are you going to try
to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions ?
yes , i am .
you want to see a simulation on my laptop ?
oh , yeah , show me .
in microbiology , the most exciting thing
i get to work with is yeast .
howard ?
yeah ?
your shoes are delightful .
where did you get them ?
what ?
bazinga . i don &apos;t care .
ha ! eat my dust ,
racially stereotypical plumber .
that &apos;s not fair .
i got stuck behind a tree .
and a cow and a penguin .
face it , dude ,
whether it &apos;s a real car or a virtual cartoon car ,
you can &apos;t drive .
just need a little more practice .
what you need is cheat codes , motor skills and a magic genie
who grants wishes to little boys who suck at mario kart .
hey , sheldon , can i talk to you for a second ?
it &apos;s not about shoes , is it ?
i don &apos;t think i could go through that again .
it &apos;s not about shoes .
then speak .
um , actually , can we do it in private ?
all right .
go away .
i agree , it &apos;s rude , but she asked for privacy .
thanks , raj .
okay , so here &apos;s the thing :
i was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics ?
a little physics ?
there &apos;s no such thing .
physics encompasses the entire universe ,
from quantum particles to supernovas ,
from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies .
yeah , okay , cool .
i don &apos;t need the pbs special .
i just want to know enough
so i can talk to leonard about his job .
you know , like bernadette does .
why can &apos;t leonard teach you ?
&apos;cause i want to surprise him .
can &apos;t you surprise him in some other way ?
for example , i &apos;m sure he &apos;d be delightfully taken aback
if you cleaned your apartment .
come on , sheldon , this is important to me .
penny ,
this would be a massive undertaking ,
and my time is both limited and valuable .
you &apos;re sitting here playing video games all day .
okay , point .
what sort of foundation do you have ?
did you take any science classes in school ?
sure . i did the one with the frogs .
the one with the frogs .
yeah , actually , it was pretty cool .
a lot of the girls threw up , but i gutted that thing like a deer .
i &apos;m sorry , penny .
i don &apos;t think so .
oh , come on !
a smart guy like you , it &apos;ll be a challenge .
you can make it like an experiment .
interesting .
i suppose if someone could teach sign language
to koko the gorilla ...
i could teach you some rudimentary physics .
great !
it &apos;s a little insulting , but great .
i &apos;ll be koko .
not likely .
koko learned to understand over 2,000 words ,
not one of which had anything to do with shoes .
hey , fellas .
this is my girlfriend bernadette .
my girlfriend bernadette .
who are all those people ?
have no idea .
hey , leonard .
hi . hey , look ,
it &apos;s howard and his girlfriend bernadette .
thought i &apos;d give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines .
he doesn &apos;t mean salt mines .
he means where he works .
yeah , no , i got it .
so , how &apos;s your experiment going ?
ah , terrific .
we &apos;re getting the electron accelerator set up .
we should be ready to go day after tomorrow .
boy , i &apos;d love to see that .
you &apos;re welcome to come .
really ? oh , that &apos;d be great .
how exciting is that ?
like hanukkah in july .
do they have that ?
no .
you got me again .
this isn &apos;t non @-@ fat yogurt .
this is fatty fat fat .
excuse me .
could you grab me another napkin , sweetie ?
sure .
thanks , honey .
all right , what is your deal ?
excuse me ?
inviting my girlfriend
to come see your electron accelerator ?
yeah ? so ?
you really are a piece of work .
it &apos;s not enough
you get the prom queen , you have to get
the head of the decorating committee , too ?
what are you talking about ?
don &apos;t play innocent with me .
i practically invented
using fancy lab equipment to seduce women .
has it ever worked ?
not so far , but that &apos;s not the point !
howard , relax .
i &apos;m not interested in your girlfriend .
i hope not .
because you don &apos;t want to mess with me .
i &apos;m crazy .
i believe you .
research journal , entry one .
i &apos;m about to embark on one of
the great challenges of my scientific career :
teaching penny physics .
i &apos;m calling it project gorilla .
hey , sheldon .
come in . take a seat .
subject has arrived .
i &apos;ve extended a friendly casual greeting .
ready to get started ?
one moment .
subject appears well @-@ rested and enthusiastic .
apparently , ignorance is bliss .
all right , let us begin .
where &apos;s your notebook ?
um , i don &apos;t have one .
how are you going to take notes without a notebook ?
i have to take notes ?
how else are you gonna study for the tests ?
there &apos;s gonna be a test ?
test @-@ sss .
here .
it &apos;s college @-@ ruled .
i hope that &apos;s not too intimidating .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
now , introduction to physics .
what is physics ?
physics comes from the ancient greek word &quot; physika . &quot;
it &apos;s at this point that you &apos;ll want to start taking notes .
&quot; physika &quot; means the science of natural things .
and it is there , in ancient greece , that our story begins .
ancient greece ? !
hush .
if you have questions , raise your hand .
it &apos;s a warm summer evening , circa 600 bc .
you &apos;ve finished your shopping at the local market , or agora ...
... and you look up at the night sky .
there you notice some of the stars seem to move ,
so you name them &quot; planetes , &quot; or &quot; wanderer . &quot;
yes , penny ?
um , does this have anything to do with leonard &apos;s work ?
this is the beginning of a 2,600 @-@ year journey
we &apos;re going to take together from the ancient greeks
through isaac newton to niels bohr
to erwin schrodinger
to the dutch researchers
that leonard is currently ripping off .
2,600 years ?
yeah , give or take .
as i was saying , it &apos;s a warm summer evening
in ancient greece ...
yes , penny ?
i have to go to the bathroom .
can &apos;t you hold it ?
not for 2,600 years .
project gorilla , entry two .
i am exhausted .
howard ?
huh ?
it unhooks in the front .
oh , that explains a lot .
howard , i &apos;m home !
of course .
senior fitness was cancelled .
it turns out you can forget how to ride a bike .
i &apos;m fine , but , oy , did sam harpootian eat gravel .
that &apos;s great , ma !
what &apos;s great about an 80 @-@ year @-@ old armenian man
with half his chin scraped off ? !
i guess i should go .
no , no , don &apos;t move .
hey , ma , can i have lamb stew for dinner ?
lamb stew ? i &apos;d have to go to the supermarket .
please ?
i got a real hankering .
oh , i can &apos;t say no to my little tushy face .
i &apos;ll be back soon .
thanks , ma .
do you want the regular peas or the le seur ?
always le seur peas with lamb stew !
you &apos;re right ! when you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right !
what if they &apos;re out of the le seur ?
then get the regular !
all right ! you don &apos;t have to yell !
sorry about that .
let me just put that on vibrate .
i &apos;m already on vibrate .
you know , that one i got .
howard , did you say something to leonard about me ?
uh , what do you mean ?
he says if i go see his experiment tomorrow
it might weird you out .
really ? he said that ?
you &apos;re not jealous of leonard , are you ?
me ? no .
i may have mentioned that it &apos;s a little inappropriate
to be asking another man &apos;s girlfriend to his experiment
without first discussing it with said man .
are you saying i need to ask your permission to hang out with leonard ?
i didn &apos;t say anything like that .
i said leonard has to ask my permission .
come on , i don &apos;t want to eat lamb stew with my mother .
damn , i was this close on the bra .
now , remember , newton realized that aristotle was wrong
and force was not necessary to maintain motion .
so let &apos;s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared
as &quot; a &quot; and we get
force-- earth gravity- equals mass times 9.8 meters
per second per second .
so we can see that &quot; ma &quot; equals &quot; mg &quot;
and what do we know from this ?
uh , we know that ...
... newton was a really smart cookie .
oh ! is that where fig newtons come from ?
no , fig newtons are named after a small town in massachusetts .
don &apos;t write that down !
sorry .
now , if &quot; ma &quot; equals &quot; mg , &quot; what does that imply ?
i don &apos;t know .
how can you not know ?
i just told you .
have you suffered a recent blow to the head ?
hey ! you don &apos;t have to be so mean !
i &apos;m sorry .
have you suffered a recent blow to the head ?
no , you just suck at teaching .
really ?
of those two explanations , which one seems the most likely ?
oh , god ...
sheldon , i &apos;m trying to understand ,
but you &apos;re going too fast .
can you just back up a little bit ?
all right .
it &apos;s a warm summer evening in ancient greece ...
not that far back !
okay !
at what point did you begin to feel lost ?
i don &apos;t know .
where were we looking up at the night sky ?
greece .
damn it !
there &apos;s no need to get frustrated .
people learn at different rates .
unlike objects falling in a vacuum , which ... ?
&quot; ma &quot; equals &quot; mg ... &quot; ?
squared ?
no .
aristotle ?
no .
five ?
then i don &apos;t know .
why are you crying ?
because i &apos;m stupid !
that &apos;s no reason to cry .
one cries because one is sad .
for example , i cry because others are stupid
and it makes me sad .
okay , can we just please forget about all this extra stuff
and can you just tell me what leonard does ?
all right .
leonard is attempting to learn why sub @-@ atomic particles
move the way they do .
really ? that &apos;s it ?
well , that doesn &apos;t sound so complicated .
it &apos;s not .
that &apos;s why leonard does it .
okay , i just have one question .
what exactly are sub @-@ atomic particles ?
a good question .
thank you .
and to answer it , we first must ask ourselves :
&quot; what is physics ? &quot;
oh , balls .
it &apos;s a warm summer evening in ancient greece ...
okay , i got a bone to pick with you .
what did i do now ?
i was in bed with bernadette , and you text @-@ blocked me .
what ? !
we were completely naked , about to devour each other when ,
you text her that i have a problem with her hanging out with you .
you do have a problem with her hanging out with me .
yeah , but that &apos;s not what you tell her .
what was i supposed to tell her ?
i don &apos;t know . something that doesn &apos;t make me come off
as a petty , jealous douche .
and what would that be ?
come on , do i have to think of everything ?
hey , leonard .
am i too late to see the experiment ?
what are you doing here ?
same thing you &apos;re doing here .
i came to see leonard &apos;s experiment .
no , you didn &apos;t .
you said leonard &apos;s experiment was stupid .
you told her my experiment was stupid ?
i was just repeating what sheldon said .
let &apos;s not get off topic .
bernadette , i need to apologize .
i was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with .
should i , um , leave you two alone ?
no , leonard , you should hear this .
okay , good , &apos; cause i wasn &apos;t really gonna go .
look , i know i come off as confident and worldly , but ...
the truth is i &apos;m not .
we &apos;re shocked .
which is why i tend to feel threatened by other guys .
or loud noises , clowns and nuns .
but i now realize how foolish that is .
he had a panic attack once
when he got his head stuck in a sweater .
it was a full turtleneck .
why aren &apos;t you helping me ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe because i &apos;m ... crazy ? !
bernadette , please , i &apos;m asking you to give me another chance .
what do you think , leonard ?
should i give him another chance ?
it &apos;s up to you .
he didn &apos;t call your experiment stupid .
come here , tushy face .
&quot; tushy face . &quot;
that is going on twitter right now .
raj , you should &apos;ve seen leonard &apos;s experiment .
the interference pattern was so cool
when the electron beam was on .
glad you enjoyed it .
most people aren &apos;t that interested in what i do .
actually , that &apos;s not true , leonard .
in fact , recently i &apos;ve been thinking that
given the parameters of your experiment ,
the transport of electrons through the aperture
of the nano @-@ fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different
than the experiment already conducted in the netherlands .
their observed phase shift
in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring
already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue
of the aharonov @-@ bohm quantum @-@ interference effect .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s all i know .
oh , wait ... !
fig newtons were named after a town in massachusetts ,
