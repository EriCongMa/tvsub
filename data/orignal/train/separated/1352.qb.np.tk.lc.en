attention , passengers .
the 6 : 45 train is now departing .
take the far end of the platform .
yeah .
attention , passengers .
the 6 : 45 train is now departing .
i &apos;m just saying that &quot; kent drake &quot;
is not the name of a real person .
i &apos;ve seen his file and his picture .
we had a videoconference interview .
tall , dark , handsome ,
suit slightly too large for his body ?
because his superhero suit is on underneath it .
he is not a superhero .
he is a military @-@ school graduate .
superhero .
glasgow medical school .
just finished a tour in afghanistan .
marvel superhero .
well , is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
if you have to ask ...
anyway , he wants to move from trauma medicine
to forensic pathology ,
and kent is the strongest applicant i &apos;ve had
for an assistant medical examiner
since i came to boston , so ...
six @-@ month rotation ?
you &apos;ll spend the entire time trying to figure out
what his superhero power is ...
or isn &apos;t .
uncle enzo was getting rid of it .
i can understand why . that is horrible .
oh , i have seen worse , and , even if it is , it was free .
well , the true value of something
isn &apos;t always determined by its price , angela .
which is a super polite way of saying that is horrible .
well , you two don &apos;t have to look at it .
i got it for frankie .
well , he doesn &apos;t have any taste . he &apos;ll probably love it .
rizzoli .
isles .
hey , i need some help getting this to frankie &apos;s place .
it &apos;ll have to wait till later . sorry .
i bet it &apos;s super uncomfortable , too .
it &apos;s still free !
第六季 第一集
right now , she &apos;s a jane doe .
homeless guy found her this morning .
didn &apos;t see her get dumped .
you want to keep her wrapped up , right ?
yes , i don &apos;t want to lose anything
that might be trapped in the rug with her .
hey , good luck , frankie .
thanks , garcia .
how does everybody know i &apos;m trying to get the bric commander job ?
because you &apos;ve had lunch with every boss at bpd .
well , not every boss .
yeah , only because nobody wants to watch mccorskey eat .
well , i would say he has a temporomandibular disorder .
makes chewing difficult .
well , he doesn &apos;t know you said it .
if you feel so bad , why don &apos;t you take him out to lunch ?
i don &apos;t feel that bad .
the dumpster was emptied two days ago ,
so the body could only have been there since then .
are there any offices or apartments
that are near this alley ?
no , it &apos;s all warehouses and manufacturing .
well , that probably means
she came from somewhere else , then .
and judging by the size of this rug ,
might have taken two people to get her here .
two people who didn &apos;t think anybody would notice them
dumping a body in downtown boston .
so we can eliminate folks who stand out .
clowns .
siamese twins ?
mccorskey .
i &apos;ll make sure the uniforms are asking
about two people looking suspicious .
centaurs .
pirates .
organ @-@ grinders .
well , everyone would notice the monkeys .
excuse me .
excuse me !
dr. isles .
yes .
no .
hi . i &apos;m kent drake .
nice to meet you .
and you must be detective rizzoli .
yes . hi .
senior criminalist chang , she , uh --
well , um , she holds you in very high regard .
anyway , susie told me to go ahead and get started .
now , i was concerned about losing any trace evidence ,
so i -- i &apos;ve wrapped the body so i could vacuum around here .
watch the rug , please .
um , now , given the fact that she &apos;s a jane doe ,
i removed her effects and laid them out .
hopefully , we can help with identification .
in plastic wrapping , per jaybee .
yeah , well , i didn &apos;t know
your policies and procedures around here ,
so i just went , well , textbook .
you &apos;ve been very busy .
yeah , well , in a conflict zone ,
you get used to moving at a fast pace .
i &apos;m sorry . do you like my shoes ?
they &apos;re very comfortable .
you should try them sometime .
no .
nope !
the internet village .
i &apos;m just gonna go there .
nice to meet you .
is she always like that ?
yes .
in the very best way possible .
well , let &apos;s get started .
we only have six months to complete your training .
that &apos;s mona .
mona carson .
when was the last time you saw her ?
when she gave her notice three weeks ago .
she was so nice .
i just can &apos;t believe that she --
she say why she was giving her notice ?
no .
she &apos;d been pulling away from all of us for a while .
you must have some idea .
spike .
is that her boyfriend ?
yeah .
when they started to get serious , she changed ,
got ... nervous , withdrawn .
spike is probably not the name his parents gave him .
that &apos;s the only thing she ever called him .
but i have a picture .
he was at mona &apos;s birthday party .
he still look like that ?
last time i saw him .
i never liked him , but with your friends ,
it &apos;s hard to say something , you know ?
watch your fingers .
watch your fingers . okay .
that way .
all right .
oh , god .
i don &apos;t remember frankie &apos;s apartment being this nice .
yeah , it &apos;s a different apartment . he moved .
what ?
yeah , this one is two floors higher .
i guess i didn &apos;t notice
what button you pushed in the elevator .
i was so worried about trying to avoid a hernia
of the entire body .
that &apos;s not what a hernia is .
yes , i know that .
how come i didn &apos;t know
that frankie was getting a new place ?
uh ... he was keeping it a secret ?
until when ?
i ...
oh ! what the hell ? !
until now , i &apos;m guessing .
i &apos;ve seen your chest .
yeah , but that was always near a pool .
ma , what are you doing here ?
what are you doing ,
not telling me that you got a new place ?
i was gonna tell youse , as it &apos;s all fixed up .
there -- it &apos;s all fixed up .
i don &apos;t want that .
it &apos;s a nice chair .
it &apos;s awful ,
and i &apos;m trying to go a different way .
yeah , the secret way .
come on , janie .
like you don &apos;t have any secrets .
yes , i have secrets . i &apos;m allowed to have secrets .
you are not allowed .
i just wanted it to be totally nice when you saw it .
so you &apos;d know i &apos;m not your door @-@ and @-@ cinder @-@ block ,
desk @-@ using younger brother anymore .
all right , that &apos;s sweet .
what about the chair ?
totally cramping my style .
will you take it downstairs ?
i &apos;m getting ready for a date .
sure .
fine , fine .
i &apos;ll do it .
i think you look great .
you should wear pants .
have fun tonight .
ma , this chair is --
free !
free covers a lot of ugly .
so , it turns out our vic not only quit her job ,
she closed her social @-@ media accounts ,
cancelled her cellphone , stopped using her credit cards .
to top it all off , when they searched her apartment ,
they found a packed suitcase .
she was about to go on the run .
or enter a convent .
both good options for a woman with a bad boyfriend .
well , i think there are a few other things
she might have considered .
i didn &apos;t find any calls to shelters
or restraining orders filed with police .
is there any evidence that spike was actually abusive ?
one neighbor said she never heard them fighting ,
but a couple of weeks ago ,
she complimented spike on his hair --
he almost ripped her head off .
so he &apos;s wound a little tight .
clearly .
tight enough to snap
if he thought mona was gonna leave him ?
only way to know for sure is to find him .
is her apartment missing a rug ?
hardwood floors . no way to know .
if it was easy , anybody could do it .
holiday .
rizzoli .
sounds like something your mom would serve for dinner .
&quot; kids , come to the table .
the holiday rizzoli is ready . &quot;
you don &apos;t know many italians , do you ?
just you guys .
because my ma would &apos;ve said that about 80 decibels louder
and the phrases &quot; before i &quot; and &quot; don &apos;t make me &quot;
are conspicuously missing .
i went through mona &apos;s cellphone records .
before she stopped using it ,
there were a lot of calls to a cecil wilson .
is that the boyfriend , spike ?
if my name were cecil ,
almost anything would be preferable .
we have an address ?
yep . i &apos;ll text it to you .
and jane .
tell her i &apos;ll meet them there .
and while our satellite offices
don &apos;t have the lab equipment that we do ,
we will process , on a priority basis ,
any evidence you deem necessary .
how long have you actually worked here ?
about five years .
and did you ever practice any other type of medicine
before you became an m.e. ?
only in my residency .
so , our refrigerated storage is down the hall .
would you like to see it ?
do you actually enjoy this managerial side of your job ?
you ask a lot of questions .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just curious .
i am not prying maliciously .
please , feel free to ask me anything you like .
well , i have worn those shoes , working out ,
but i &apos;ve never really thought of them as business attire .
right , well , technically , that &apos;s not a question , is it ?
no , i just don &apos;t find them suitable .
unlike your 4 @-@ inch heels ?
three , and i often have business meetings .
you don &apos;t have to justify your choice to me .
i have no judgment .
if he &apos;s in there , he hasn &apos;t come out .
if he &apos;s not there , he hasn &apos;t come home .
all right . we &apos;re gonna go check out the apartment .
you sit tight . call us if you see him .
bpd . we &apos;d like to talk to you .
frankie , he &apos;s on the run ,
probably going down the fire escape .
head down to the lobby
in case he goes through a window on another floor .
frankie , he &apos;s headed north down the back alley .
take the far end of the platform .
boston police !
drop your weapon !
back up . i need everyone to take a step back .
i need an ambulance
at the essex street subway platform for a gunshot victim .
this is an officer @-@ involved shooting .
did he have a gun ?
yeah .
did you pick it up ?
no .
where is it ?
i don &apos;t know . we &apos;ll find it .
where is it , korsak ? !
jane , he -- he -- he had a gun .
i @-@ i @-@ i swear he had a gun .
okay . we &apos;ll find it .
he had a gun , jane .
okay .
we just need to know what happened
so we can figure out where it went .
i was chasing that spike guy .
he ran through a group of people ,
and then , all of a sudden ,
that ... other guy was pointing a gun at me .
you said he ran near spike ?
yeah , yeah , he definitely did .
is it possible the gun was in spike &apos;s hand
and you just thought that it was --
the guy i shot had a gun !
al @-@ all right , frankie . he &apos;s got to ask , okay ?
okay .
all right .
oh , my god .
if we can &apos;t find that gun , i &apos;m screwed .
listen to me , okay ?
korsak and i are going to talk to the witnesses .
all right ? we &apos;ll look at the security video .
how long before iad gets here , huh , 10 minutes ?
they &apos;re not gonna let you do anything .
frankie .
do you remember bennie johnson ?
he was a dirty cop . this is a totally different thing .
we will find the gun , okay ?
i promise .
jane .
how is he ?
not much bleeding externally ,
so it &apos;s possible that he &apos;s hemorrhaging internally .
the trauma unit is waiting for him at general .
okay . what is that ?
frankie seems anxious , which is understandable .
this was a very traumatic event .
so the emts gave me a mild sedative to administer to him .
and he can &apos;t talk to iad until it wears off .
i &apos;m just treating the symptoms .
we &apos;re gonna send you to the hospital , okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re gonna go to the hospital ,
and maura has a sedative to help you calm down .
don &apos;t talk to anybody until you can think clearly .
okay . okay .
i heard back from the union .
they &apos;re sending a lawyer to the hospital .
okay , thanks .
social services to pediatrics .
the victim &apos;s name is sean hughes .
23 years old , lives in south boston .
what are the odds that spike and sean don &apos;t know each other ?
seems unlikely .
so , if mona and that carpet
were put in a dumpster by two people --
maybe sean &apos;s one of them , maybe spike &apos;s the other --
and they were meeting at the platform .
sean pulls a gun
&apos;cause he doesn &apos;t want to get caught for mona &apos;s murder .
it makes sense .
still doesn &apos;t explain what happened to the gun .
well , maybe it got kicked into the tracks
and a train pushed it down the tunnel .
maybe somebody picked it up .
hitchcock from iad .
oh , that &apos;s a short straw .
we need the security video from that platform .
iad &apos;s gonna piss all over us
if we start investigating this shooting .
well , then we better do as much as we can
before they find out .
sean hughes is a student at sbcc .
takes a lot of poli @-@ sci classes .
i found some donations to left @-@ leaning politicians
and pictures of him at demonstrations ,
but everything &apos;s of the chant @-@ in @-@ unison sort .
nothing indicates he &apos;s violent .
he ever been in our system ?
no , he &apos;s clean .
except that , if sean had a gun --
he had a gun .
then sean didn &apos;t have a license for it .
it &apos;s possible he registered under another name .
i &apos;ll keep digging .
who &apos;s processing the warrant for his credit @-@ card records ?
no one .
i don &apos;t want iad knowing that we &apos;re looking at him
and shutting us down before we even get started .
um , what about the security video at the subway platform ?
techs are at the subway working on it .
should be in our building any minute .
can you sweet @-@ talk a copy for us ?
it &apos;s the fastest way we &apos;re gonna clear frankie .
rizzoli .
yeah .
i &apos;m grabbing a sandwich .
how &apos;s a half @-@ hour ?
great . thanks .
iad ?
clock &apos;s ticking .
the victim &apos;s stomach contents .
maltodextrin , oat powder ,
whey isolate .
protein shake .
the ingredients are consistent
with a commercial product called parallax .
computer geeks drink it so they don &apos;t have to leave their chairs .
well , she had excellent muscle tone ,
so she definitely left her chair .
is there something else we can do ?
mona died before the shooting ,
so i &apos;m not sure what else she has to tell us .
it &apos;s a simple question , detective .
how did frankie seem this morning ?
fine .
he was the same asshole
that i &apos;ve been dealt with for the past 35 years .
look , we get it .
you &apos;re chasing a potential killer .
it &apos;s a crowded subway platform .
frankie gets worried a bystander may get hurt ,
so he fires off a warning shot .
is that what frankie said ?
we &apos;re just trying to figure out how an unarmed civilian
gets shot by a bpd detective .
you don &apos;t have to figure it out .
all you have to do is -- is watch the security video .
the facts should speak for themselves .
wha-- have you seen it ?
we &apos;re not at liberty to say .
did you see the gun , jane ?
no .
simmons , come on , all right ?
you &apos;re a good guy . just --
just keep an open mind , okay ?
of course .
seems like you need to keep an open mind yourself , detective .
vince .
hey , sam .
it &apos;s been a long time .
you were at the bar last night .
you know , you should come back to the bowling league .
you &apos;re right . i should .
send me an e @-@ mail and let me know the next night .
yeah , will do .
iad knows something .
yep .
the video system at the subway malfunctioned .
it won &apos;t clear frankie because it &apos;s blank .
how do you know that ?
sam lewis slipped me this downstairs .
he knew they wouldn &apos;t tell us .
there &apos;ll be a lot of ass @-@ covering .
没有录像
we didn &apos;t see anything .
we haven &apos;t found a witness who saw anything .
without that video ...
it &apos;s just frankie &apos;s word there was a gun .
there &apos;s no proof .
they &apos;re gonna hang him out to dry .
here &apos;s the latest on the police shooting
at the essex street subway station .
the spokesperson for boston general confirmed
that the victim is in surgery ...
here , baby .
... and , at this point ...
okay ,
had no comment , on his condition .
that &apos;s enough of this .
they &apos;re saying the d.a.
is gonna take the shooting to a grand jury ,
if the facts continue to support it .
maybe even tomorrow .
the facts won &apos;t support it .
ma ...
i could go to jail .
nope .
we didn &apos;t find a gun .
which doesn &apos;t mean there wasn &apos;t one .
then where did it go ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i know you and i know jane
and you don &apos;t just shoot people for no reason .
and jane won &apos;t stop
until she gets to the bottom of things .
right ?
frankie , everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
i know it .
have you made any progress yet ?
what if he did it , maura ?
i mean , what if he shot an unarmed man ?
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s a little worse now .
sean hughes died .
his body is on its way here for an autopsy .
well , you can &apos;t do an autopsy
because you &apos;re frankie &apos;s friend .
right .
and i can &apos;t watch the autopsy because i &apos;m frankie &apos;s sister .
that is , in theory , true .
how long have these cameras been in the autopsy room ?
my predecessor thought he might get rich
if he made a series of instructional videos .
get out of the way !
oh ! come on .
did you see the stomach contents ?
uh -- no .
okay , give -- give me your coffee .
wait , that --
steve ?
hmm ?
i went to get a coffee and they made it wrong ,
so i have an extra cappuccino .
thought you &apos;d be tired and you might want it .
no , thanks .
okay .
well , i will just --
i &apos;ll leave it right here in case you change your mind .
okay .
come on . get the coffee .
well , what are you gonna do
when he finds out it &apos;s used coffee ?
yes !
yes ! okay .
there you go .
he had some weird food .
mona had a protein drink in her stomach .
i mean , there &apos;s no way for me to know
if what &apos;s in that basin is the same as what she drank , but ...
well , two liquid lunches do seem coincidental .
i &apos;m not going to say that .
yeah , but if they &apos;re drinking the same kind of drink
and sean hughes and mona carson are connected
and he &apos;s murder @-@ adjacent ,
and i can keep looking into his shooting
as part of my case .
i will totally forgive you for taking my coffee .
you &apos;re welcome .
korsak , hey , what judge owes you a favor ?
i @-@ i &apos;m really sorry , detectives .
i &apos;m not supposed to let anyone in .
right , except for anyone involved in the investigation .
good for you , standing your ground .
i &apos;m sure that sergeant ...
washington .
washington would like to hear about this .
not every newbie can do that .
aren &apos;t you impressed , korsak ?
bursting .
thanks .
good job .
what the hell are those ?
i have no idea .
jane , i--
hey , i just sent you a picture . what are we looking at ?
look at the back or the bottom . see if there are any labels .
yeah , fco , dme , sfx .
those are routers .
the codes on the bottom correspond to airport codes of
the cities they &apos;re routing through .
jane--
routers ?
and they had programmer food in their stomachs .
these three knew each other . they were up to something .
jane--
that &apos;s why sean had a gun . that &apos;s why mona is dead .
korsak .
yes .
can you guys come back to bpd ?
yeah , we &apos;ll be right there .
hey . let &apos;s see it .
i grabbed the footage from social @-@ media sites ,
so it &apos;s jumpy and there are missing moments ,
but it &apos;s the best i can do with what we &apos;ve got .
stop .
back it up .
there .
play it forward , slowly .
there was a gun .
somebody took it .
we know it wasn &apos;t spike because we saw him run off .
are you gonna tell iad ?
no .
they won &apos;t let frankie off the hook
unless we can deliver them another suspect .
so we should do that .
yes , we should .
that &apos;s rizzoli @-@ ese for &quot; thank you . &quot;
hey , korsak .
come here for a second .
watch this guy right here .
he doesn &apos;t panic when frankie &apos;s gun goes off .
no , and then he just calmly walks into the crowd .
like he sees sean &apos;s gun on the ground
and heads over to pick it up ?
yeah .
why ?
maybe he needed a gun .
or maybe he didn &apos;t want sean to be found with a gun .
again , why ?
well , we have spike , who runs right near a guy with a gun ,
then we have this guy , who is completely unfazed by the entire thing .
some sort of criminal conspiracy .
i &apos;m okay with saying they weren &apos;t planning a bake sale .
the algorithms for facial recognition fall into two categories--
geometric , which focuses on features , and photometric .
so how long does this program usually take to find a match ?
a few minutes .
a few ... days .
forever .
this is the essex street subway platform .
and this is where boston rapid transit
keeps the wireless routers that control the signal lights
and the switches for the west side .
so maybe mr. laptop was trying to break in to the router
to disrupt traffic , even crash a train .
hello .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . kent drake .
vince korsak .
kent is doing a rotation here before taking over
as the assistant medical examiner in springfield .
you two have a lot in common . you &apos;re both ex @-@ military .
vietnam ?
spanish @-@ american war .
that &apos;s funny .
at least my shoes have laces .
i hate him .
so , are we narrowing the search ?
yes , but the trick is
to not narrow it so much that you exclude the subject .
this one didn &apos;t .
john stanton .
six months ago , his house was seized ,
eminent domain ,
and he was arrested for trying to set fire to a bulldozer .
guy with a cause collected a few cohorts .
who took his house ?
brt .
his house was in the new path of the southern spur of the subway .
detective hitchcock told me that ,
even if you had a warrant , i shouldn &apos;t let you in .
hardly seems sporting .
or legal .
i got to call in .
i &apos;ve got a warrant , and i &apos;m not gonna let you stop me ,
but you call internal affairs .
i don &apos;t want you getting in trouble .
good man .
well , i &apos;m not trying to ...
we got about 15 minutes .
a router isn &apos;t gonna give us much --
an ip address , a log of who accessed it .
john stanton has been completely off the grid for two months .
a pi address and a log is more than we had .
ip address .
what &apos;d i say ?
pi address .
that &apos;d come as no surprise to you
that i often don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
weird .
what ?
someone &apos;s pinging this location , trying to get a response .
can you tell where they are ?
shouldn &apos;t take more than 15 minutes .
y @-@ y @-@ you can &apos;t see who it is , though .
no , but i have a name
and a pretty good idea of what this is about ,
so that &apos;s enough for me to catch him .
thanks , jane ! okay .
okay ! lots of feelings .
i get it , yeah . okay .
oh , god !
okay , yeah .
okay , wait for it .
it &apos;s korsak . he wants you to meet him .
all right , the hug &apos;s over , frankie .
you okay to get a ride back to the precinct ?
no problem .
have you seen him ?
we don &apos;t know who &apos;s in there .
nina just said someone inside that restaurant
is pinging the router at sean hughes &apos; house .
you know iad is gonna go ballistic if we arrest someone .
this totally throws a monkey wrench
in their plan to pin this on frankie .
i know .
well , i would understand if you wanted to stay here .
up yours , rizzoli .
i &apos;m ready .
cecil .
nice to finally meet you .
i didn &apos;t have anything to do with that .
then who did ?
i don &apos;t know .
but you knew she was dead ,
or you wouldn &apos;t have run from us .
maybe i just don &apos;t like cops .
you know , we hear that a lot , usually from guilty people .
i didn &apos;t kill mona .
did john stanton ?
yeah , we know about him .
we know about his beef with the brt .
did you know that sean died ?
so that leaves you and john
as the only two people that we get to put in jail
for whatever stupid thing that you had planned ,
but you &apos;re the only one we got in custody .
we didn &apos;t do anything .
not yet .
do you think john stanton &apos;s sitting around ,
wondering how you &apos;re doing ?
the minute that he puts your plan into action
is the minute that you &apos;re on the hook for it ,
and her murder
and sean &apos;s shooting .
who doesn &apos;t like cops now ?
is everything all right ?
yes , yes .
susie told me to get her ready
so that she can be released to her family .
okay .
does it make you feel any better ?
what ?
does it make you feel any better
figuring out who committed the murder ?
it &apos;s very satisfying using science to solve a mystery .
i don &apos;t think that answers my question .
some cases are ...
so awful that i put them away .
i choose not to think about them
so they don &apos;t color my view of the world .
but most of the time , i believe that the truth
helps the people who loved these victims .
i guess that makes me feel better .
good answer .
come on . you can see a gun .
frankie didn &apos;t shoot an unarmed man .
what you just showed me doesn &apos;t prove anything .
okay , okay , fine . how about this ?
all right , mona carson .
this guy , john stanton , killed her ,
and we believe that sean hughes helped dispose of her body .
you have a very active imagination , detective .
mona carson is dead because she was involved
in a plan to crash a subway train
at essex street station .
do you have proof of any of this ?
meet cecil wilson .
was there a plan to crash a subway train ?
it was mostly john . we were --
was sean supposed to bring a gun to the platform ?
yes .
now , we have solved this case for you ,
and we &apos;ll let you take the credit
if you call the d.a. &apos; s office right now
and tell them that frankie did nothing wrong .
where &apos;s stanton ?
i &apos;ll tell you after you make the call .
come on . you get to take a picture with the mayor !
this is detective hitchcock .
i need to speak to the d.a.
okay , where &apos;s stanton ?
i have no idea .
i will tell you --
he &apos;s too smart to go to essex street .
now , there are three other subway stations
with wireless routers .
what do you say we split up and find him
before he kills a bunch of innocent people ?
i don &apos;t see him .
me either .
i mean , now that we &apos;re down here ,
do you think he would actually risk
getting caught on one of these platforms ?
i wouldn &apos;t , not if i could avoid it .
neither would i.
holiday .
hey . is there any way that stanton
could turn off the signal lights or switch the tracks
without ever coming down to the platform ?
maybe . he &apos;d need a booster to amplify the wireless signal
so he could access it above ground .
what does a booster look like ?
a plastic box .
small .
he could tape it anywhere ,
but he &apos;d want line of sight for a better signal .
i &apos;ll look this way .
okay .
korsak , i found it .
i unboosted him .
there he is .
put the laptop down .
you &apos;re gonna be losing a lot more than that signal .
hey , we &apos;re heading out .
oh , great . have a good --
nice !
he looks superhot , right ?

it -- it &apos;s not actionable , is it ?
i mean , you don &apos;t work for me .

no .
i just don &apos;t like people making assumptions about me .
ex @-@ military guy puts on a slightly nerdy affect
to throw off his new colleagues .

exactly like that .
i wanted to see how you &apos;d react ,
what you &apos;d react to .
still , it &apos;s a bit like lying , isn &apos;t it ?
but we all lie in our own little way , don &apos;t we ?
