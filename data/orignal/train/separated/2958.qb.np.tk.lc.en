ross and charlie ?
wow ! she &apos;s really making her way through the group , huh ?
eh , who am i to talk ?
yeah .
i can &apos;t believe this . rachel and joey ?
how about the dinosaur twins in the other room ?

not until you said it . somebody switch !
wow ! wait a minute .
ross and charlie . joey and rachel .
phoebe and mike . we &apos;re the only ones leaving with the person we came with !
that &apos;s not true . i came with monica , i &apos;m leaving with weird al .
okay , i &apos;ve had it with the hair jokes .
tomorrow i &apos;m going to the salon .
okay , buckwheat .
you gotta hear this , it &apos;s great ! it &apos;s like free porn .
is everything okay ?
it &apos;s just .. i don &apos;t think i can do this .
oh , is it because of what might be on the bed ?
i saw that report , with the infrared ..
no ! no .
no .
look , i need to talk to joey . i mean , you guys just broke up .
before anything more happens between us , i need to know he &apos;s okay with it .
i completely understand .
all right , i &apos;m gonna go find him .
i just need a second before i can , you know ..
grandma , grandma , grandma .
okay , i &apos;ll see you later .
okay !
that &apos;s the door . he &apos;s gone .
and she &apos;s turning on the tv ..
and watching miss congeniality .
honey ? if you know it through a wall , you know it too well .
hey , what are you guys doing ?
we &apos;re just .. we &apos;re sad to go , so we &apos;re just saying goodbye to the hotel .
i love you ..
paradise hotel golf resort and spa .
yeah . we had a great time , thank you .
bye .
okay . hey , have you guys seen joey anywhere ?
he &apos;s probably in his room with his current girlfriend , charlie .
that &apos;s the situation as we know it .
if you see him , could you tell him i &apos;m looking for him ?
you got it .
thanks .
thank you .
other wall , people ! other wall !
rach , you there ?
oh , my god , that &apos;s ross !
what are we gonna do ?
okay , just be calm .
for all he knows , we &apos;re just hanging out .
all right ? so just be nonchalant .
that &apos;s not nonchalant !
no idea what it means .
okay , just hide .
rach ?
coming ! try under the bed .
there &apos;s no room under the bed ..
is everything okay ?
yeah .
hey . do you know where joey is ? - hi .
i really don &apos;t .
can i talk to you for a minute ?
yeah . sure .
i don &apos;t believe this . have you guys been .. ?
this is the listening side of the wall .
then she told me that she and joey had broken up ..
and part of the reason was she had feelings for me .
right . yeah .
you know i &apos;ve wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her .
oh , i know , i know . that &apos;s been really hard for you .
anyway , one thing led to another , and ..
before you know it , we were kissing .
how angry do you think joey &apos;s gonna be ?
that is hard to say , ross . that is hard to say .
i gotta find him . he &apos;s gotta be here someplace .
you would think .
joey ?
is he gone ?
how are you doing this ?
what ? hey !
what are you .. ? what is this ? have you been listening this entire time ?
yeah !
now , what is this ?
what is this ? well , let &apos;s see . we kissed for 10 minutes ..
and now we &apos;re talking to our friends about it , so i guess this is sixth grade .
no , no . have you thought about how complicated this could get ?
what about ross ?
well , he &apos;s with charlie now .
yeah , but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her .
and as his friend , i mean , don &apos;t you think he deserves the same from you ?
you &apos;re a pain in my ass , geller .
look , we appreciate all the advice ..
but this is between joey and me . we can handle it .
we &apos;ll go . will you do one thing for us , the people that care about you ?
sure .
enunciate .
get out !
are they right ?
probably , yeah . i mean , maybe we should ..
hold off until we talk to ross .
yeah . yeah . we can wait . we don &apos;t have to do anything tonight .
yeah , i think that would be best .
so , i &apos;m gonna .. i &apos;m gonna take off .
although ..
i like &quot; although . &quot;
i mean , you know ..
ross and i haven &apos;t dated in , like ..
six years .
six years ?
wow . that &apos;s almost as long as high school .
plus , you know , he is with charlie now .
absolutely .
he &apos;s not thinking about you .
no .
i &apos;m thinking about you .
yeah .
let &apos;s forget about ross .
it &apos;s forgotten .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
seriously , what is it ?
nothing . it &apos;s really .. it &apos;s nothing . come here . come here .
what &apos;s wrong ?
sorry , i just ..
i can &apos;t seem to get ross out of my head .
well , maybe i can help .
your lips are so soft . do that again .
yeah , we need to talk to ross . yeah .
hey . you guys ready to go ?
not quite . monica &apos;s at the salon , and i &apos;m finishing packing .
dude , you &apos;re not taking your bible ?
you &apos;re not supposed to take that .
besides , it &apos;s a new testament . what are you gonna do with it ?
learn about jesus .
hey !
so did you talk to joey ?
no . i couldn &apos;t find him . i &apos;m just gonna talk to him on the plane .
okay . sounds like a good idea , dr. geller .
stop it .
ph.d.
you &apos;re filthy .
hey . have you guys seen monica ?
actually , i think she went to the salon .
oh , yeah . oh , she went to the salon , all right .
check it out !
whose day just got better ?
chandler !
hey !
what do you think ?
i think ..
i think i can see your scalp .
don &apos;t you just love it ?
yeah . yeah , you got shellfish in your head .
it &apos;s something . you go , girlfriend .
you never said that in your life .
not once .
i thought so .
phoebe ?
i &apos;m so glad you did that .
oh , and listen to this .
what do you know ? it &apos;s a treat for the eyes and the ears .
wow , it &apos;s kind of weird that i &apos;m sitting next to charlie after we broke up .
yeah . it &apos;s almost as if air barbados doesn &apos;t care about your social life .
does someone mind switching and sitting with charlie ?
oh , i mean , i .. dude , i spent the whole conference with charlie .
i understand .
no , i &apos;ll do it .
wish i could switch . i really don &apos;t want to sit with allen lverson over there .
hey .
hey .
once we &apos;re in the air and the captain turns off the seat belt sign ..
you feel free to roam about my cabin .
and you should be careful when checking your overhead bins .
because items may shift during ..
oh , you &apos;re not good at this .
do you have to go home tonight ?
no , i think i could come over .
it &apos;s saturday , right ?
what ?
i can &apos;t do anything tonight .
why not ?
i have a date .
you have a date ? with who ?
oh , it &apos;s my girlfriend .
you have a girlfriend ?
yeah .
well , when you and i broke up , i started seeing someone .
well , for how long ?
three months .
three months ?
okay .
this is none of my business , but how long are you gonna keep seeing her ?
i &apos;ll tell her that it &apos;s over tonight at dinner . i promise .
oh , okay , good . you do that .
when you get home , maybe there &apos;ll be a special delivery package waiting for you .
maybe i &apos;ll sign for it , tear it open .
pull out the packing material ..
we &apos;ll have sex . let &apos;s leave it there .
it &apos;s our last glimpse of barbados .
and my last glimpse of anything .
all right , i &apos;m gonna go talk to joey . i think this is the right time .
he &apos;s in a good mood after the flight attendant says &quot; duty @-@ free . &quot;
okay . good luck .
you know , if he &apos;s not okay with this then nothing more can happen between us .
i know .
well , if that &apos;s the case , i just want you to know ..
that i think i could have fallen for you really , really hard .
on the other hand , if he is okay with us ..
then , you know , it &apos;s cas , whatever .
ross is coming over . i think now would be a good time to talk to him .
i guess so . i &apos;m just .. i &apos;m really nervous .
well , keep in mind that by the time you &apos;re done ..
they &apos;ll probably be serving dinner .
still nervous ?
i &apos;m gonna get the lasagna .
hey , rach ?
yeah ?
do you mind if i sit here for a sec ?
yeah . yeah , sure . yeah .
good luck .
hey .
hey .
so i ..
i kind of need to talk to you about charlie .
yeah ?
last night , after you guys broke up ..
so sorry to hear about that , by the way .
well , charlie and i were talking , and ..
well ..
you kissed .
wh .. what ?
what ? what would give you that idea ?
i saw you .
yeah , we kissed .
but nothing else . nothing else happened , okay ?
ross , ross , ross . it &apos;s okay .
what ?
it &apos;s okay . you know , look ..
i totally understand , all right ? you guys ..
make way more sense than her and i ever did , you know ? and ..
i want you to be happy .
are you serious ?
yeah .
now i have something ..
i am speechless .
i mean , the fact that you would put my happiness first like that , i mean ..
you &apos;re an incredible friend , do you know that ?
well , look , before you go ..
no , i mean it .
i mean , you &apos;re so loyal , man . and selfless and generous .
i am those things , yeah .
i &apos;ve known chandler longer , so i think of him as my best friend . but now ..
i may have to rethink some stuff .
dude !
hey , if there is ever anything i can do for you ..
i can &apos;t think of anything .
thanks .
yeah .
so hi .
hi .
so you talked to joey ?
oh , yeah . we had a really good talk .
oh , that &apos;s great .
yeah .
so everything &apos;s okay ?
oh , no , it &apos;s great .
it &apos;s great . he &apos;s an amazing guy .
oh , well , obviously , i think so too .
well , i &apos;m so excited about this .
really ? excited ?
what , are you kidding ? i have had some very dirty dreams about this .
excuse me .
you didn &apos;t tell him , did you ?
i couldn &apos;t . he was saying all these really nice things about me .
i didn &apos;t want him to get mad and take them back . i &apos;m gonna edge out chandler !
fine . forget it . when we go back to new york , i will tell him .
thank you . yeah , i appreciate that .
hi , mike &apos;s place .
hey , it &apos;s mike .
that was fast .
oh , no , she &apos;s not here yet .
you know , i &apos;m just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone .
you can &apos;t do that . oh , come on , mike , strap on a pair .
why don &apos;t you tell her that we got back together . women appreciate honesty .
we also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while , just fyl .
one more thing . there might be a picture of precious on my coffee table .
her name &apos;s precious ?
is she a pure breed , or did you pick her up at the pound ?
i just want to give you a heads up .
okay . and if she gets upset ..
just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snap .
what do you know , another hot blonde .
hi . i &apos;m precious . who are you ?
i &apos;m phoebe .
phoebe ?
mike &apos;s ex @-@ girlfriend , phoebe ? the love of his life ? that phoebe ?
enchante
oh , i can &apos;t wait for everyone at work to see these !
you go back to work tomorrow night ?
yeah .
so if you want people to see them ..
you &apos;re not having them taken out , say , at the break of dawn ?
well , if i had them taken out , then i wouldn &apos;t be able to do this .
you like that , right ?
what are you singing ?
it &apos;s &quot; bolero &quot; from 10 .
it &apos;s &quot; ride of the valkyries &quot; from apocalypse now .
here &apos;s the thing . the cornrows were a solution to your frizzy @-@ hair problem .
now that we &apos;re home , you don &apos;t have that problem . if you think about it ..
i hate them .
what ? you said you liked them .
did i ? let &apos;s refresh .
i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp .
well , fine . so you don &apos;t like them . everybody else does .
again , let &apos;s journey back .
as i recall , rachel said she had never noticed the shape of your skull before .
and joey ? well , joey didn &apos;t realize there was anything different .
you know what ? i don &apos;t care . i like it , and i &apos;m gonna keep it .
you &apos;re just jealous because your hair can &apos;t do this .
get yourself in the tooth ?
and the eye .
hi ! there she is ! hi , emma . oh , my god , i missed you .
oh , emma , i missed you so much . hi .
did you have a good time with grandma greene ? huh ?
did she give you a bottle of antidepressants again to use as a rattle ?
that was one time , ross , and they were only , like , five milligrams .
hey , emma , daddy has some presents for you , okay ?
i want you to wait right here.come here , sweetie .
ross , actually , there &apos;s something that i really need to talk to you about .
okay , shoot .
okay . all right , here &apos;s the deal .
oh , no !
what is it ?
oh , major shampoo explosion !
look , ross , this really isn &apos;t easy .
oh , it &apos;s all over everything !
why ? why me ?
because you took 300 bottles of shampoo ?
i guess things were just going too well for me .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . you were saying ?
well , yeah . look , it &apos;s about me and ..
oh , not another one !
oh , my god .. oh , and this is moisturizer ! it &apos;s even harder to clean !
why ? why do bad things happen to good people ?
wow . clearly this is not a good time .
you think ?
okay . bye .
all right , so mike &apos;s on his way over .
you thought you were meeting here , he thought at the restaurant , so ..
it doesn &apos;t matter who &apos;s right or wrong . the point is , i &apos;m gonna take off .
wait . i &apos;m not letting you leave until you tell me what &apos;s going on . i mean ..
are you guys getting back together or something ?
all right .
susie .. can i call you susie ?
my name is precious .
i can &apos;t say that .
susie , i &apos;m gonna be straight with you .
mike and i are back together . and unfortunately ..
that effectively ends your relationship with him .
he &apos;s very sorry about that , and wishes you the best luck in all your endeavors .
i just can &apos;t believe this . why ?
well , i don &apos;t ..
why would he do this ?
what &apos;s wrong with me ?
there &apos;s nothing wrong with you .
what the hell am i supposed to do now ?
damn it , woman ! pull yourself together !
have some pride , for the love of god !
okay , not a fan of the tough love .
i just can &apos;t believe that mike didn &apos;t give me any warning .
he didn &apos;t know . he wasn &apos;t planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me .
he proposed to you ? this is the worst birthday ever !
look , precious ..
mike &apos;s not worth this . you &apos;re an attractive , intelligent woman ..
and let &apos;s face it , mike &apos;s kind of a wang .
he proposed to me while he was still seeing you .
he was gonna break up with you on your birthday ?
i don &apos;t like to kiss and tell , but he cheated on you a lot this weekend .
oh , my god , you know , maybe you &apos;re right . maybe i don &apos;t need him .
i deserve to be treated with respect .
screw you , mike . you &apos;re a coward and a bastard , and i hope you rot in hell !
you &apos;re welcome .
honey ? you &apos;ve been in there for a long time . is everything okay ?
not really .
i have a problem .
really ? what happened ?
well , i was dancing around and singing &quot; no woman , no cry .. &quot;
and i got stuck .
you can &apos;t move at all ?
oh , i can move .
if i untangle you , will you please get rid of the cornrows ?
i guess so .
some of these look a little frayed .
yeah , i tried to gnaw myself free .
hey .
hi .
so ? did you tell ross ?
well , i tried ..
but then he had a shampoo @-@ related emergency .
so i guess now it &apos;s your turn again .
no , no , no , no .
i think it &apos;s better if you tell him . you know , it &apos;s easier for a woman .
that way , you know , if he gets mad , all you have to do is go :
&quot; i didn &apos;t mean it .
i &apos;m so sorry . &quot;
yeah , because that &apos;s what we do .
all right , all right , okay . how about this ? how about this ? tomorrow ..
tomorrow we &apos;ll both go and we &apos;ll tell him together .
okay , that sounds fair .
that just means , once again , we can &apos;t ..
i know .
that &apos;s okay . i mean , we can control ourselves . we &apos;re not animals .
no ! of course , we can wait .
yeah .
all right , so i guess that means good night then .
yep . good night .
good night .
good night .
seriously , good night .
stop saying good night .
i &apos;m so sorry .
look what i found in the drawer .
and you said i &apos;d never wear this .
now that i untangled you , how about you do a little something for me ?
sure . what did you have in mind ?
i think you know .
really ? i don &apos;t .. i don &apos;t really feel like it .
this is what i want to do .
okay .
i just don &apos;t get why you like it so much .
