anja !
maura , please help .
i &apos;m in my brunch clothes .
can &apos;t we just do this after we go to newbury street ?
look , we have to put my bed together
before you drag me to boutiques .
come on .
okay .
&quot; slide tab &apos; a &apos; into hole &apos; b&apos;
at the appropriate size for mattre-- &quot;
why do they got to make directions so complicated ?
okay . they &apos;re not complicated .
&quot; extend arm &apos; c &apos; to align with bed frame at point &apos; d. &apos; &quot;
i see what you mean .
and where are frost and frankie with my mattress ?
frankie , honey , watch your fingers !
is your mother here ?
yes .
she &apos;s afraid frankie will get hurt before his big interview .
well , the rate of musculoskeletal disorders
is highest among movers .
the rate for uniforms getting a slot in homicide
is lowest among mama &apos;s boys .
what ? okay , th-- that &apos;s not a mattress .
oh , hey , jane .
hi .
don &apos;t distract them !
i think they &apos;re plenty distracted already .
hey there .
are you guys sure you &apos;re okay ?
oh , yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah .
thank you so much for letting me mooch off your manpower .
yeah . mooch away .
i &apos;ll just sleep on the floor .
jane , you want to come meet your new neighbor ?
she &apos;s a tattoo artist .
i &apos;m riley cooper .
i &apos;m jane rizzoli .
hi . maura isles .
oh , a female koi fish . beautiful !
they symbolize independence and freedom .
right .
how cool that you know that .
yeah . you &apos;re so cool , maura .
anything else you need us to move ?
oh , let me think . yes . my mattress .
hey , jane .
i &apos;m going to loan riley those non @-@ stick pans i gave you .
you can &apos;t do that .
you don &apos;t use them .
well , why don &apos;t you give her the bundt pan , too , ma ?
good idea .
if you won &apos;t let me pay you ,
at least let me get you some cold beer ?
sounds good to me .
that &apos;d be great . yeah .
while my mother raids my apartment
and gives everything i have to my new neighbor ,
now i got to work on a saturday .
damn .
aw , shoot . you got to go , too ?
you make homicide , you can kiss your saturdays goodbye , too .
frankie , the mattress ?
&quot; so in love wedding chapel . &quot;
what a weird place to get married .
well , not everybody can afford a big church wedding .
so go to the justice of the peace .
i mean , at least they don &apos;t have plastic flowers .
her right carotid was severed by something very sharp .
you know , thank goodness you &apos;re here .
how would we have known it was something sharp ?
don &apos;t be mean &apos; cause your mattress is still on top of your car .
you can &apos;t get bedbugs from the street , can you ?
no , no , that &apos;s dumb , right ?
well , new mattresses can have bedbugs
if they &apos;ve been transported with old ones .
see if you have any , you know ,
brown or red stains or any pearly white casings .
oh , my -- please stop talking .
bride was anja babic , 20,
foreign exchange student from dubrovnik .
groom met her in a coffee house he was managing .
doo @-@ bu @-@ nik @-@ your @-@ upper @-@ lip to you .
i said dubrovnik is a beautiful city .
you speak croatian ?
serbian .
it &apos;s an easy language .
no , yeah , i @-@ i think i &apos;m picking it up --
super @-@ duper @-@ vodka @-@ dooby @-@ do .
groom &apos;s alibi is airtight --
he was waiting at the altar .
well , it seems pretty personal .
i &apos;ll say -- slashing her throat on her wedding day .
he gave me his phone .
says his ex @-@ fiancee has been stalking him .
she left 14 messages last night .
vick you really think i &apos;m gonna stand by
and let you marry that euro @-@ slut ? !
she &apos;s displaying signs of intermittent explosive disorder .
it was supposed to be our perfect day !
that bitch has no right !
doesn &apos;t sound too &quot; intermittent &quot; to me .
ex @-@ fiancee &apos;s name was vicky collins .
i &apos;ll put a bolo out on her .
okay .
i &apos;m calling frankie .
we could sure use his help .
are you calling him just to keep him away from riley ?
uh ... no .
frost ! come on . let &apos;s follow the blood trail .
gives new meaning to &quot; bride wars . &quot;
there should be one more layer .
the top tier of the cake is missing .
so the killer took the cake ?
do you see a knife ?
no .
um ... but i &apos;m seeing a hell of a lot of blood , though .
look at the arterial spray -- it hit the ceiling .
yeah . there &apos;s no void in the pattern .
maybe our killer cut her
and then got out of here before getting blood on himself .
or herself .
only a bridesmaid would wear shoes that color .
you talk to any bridesmaids ?
weren &apos;t any .
groom said anja didn &apos;t have any close friends .
there are two sets of clothes in here .
jeans are different sizes .
got the victim &apos;s purse .
and look at this .
well , she had at least one friend .
why did you lie to me , seth ?
there was another woman in that dressing room with anja .
who is this ?
that &apos;s lea . uh , it &apos;s anja &apos;s younger sister .
how come you never mentioned her before ?
i didn &apos;t want you to send lea back to croatia .
so you were marrying anja
to get her a green card ?
no !
and lea ran after anja was murdered ?
no !
maybe lea ran because she killed anja .
no ! that &apos;s not possible .
they were inseparable .
i know that lea ran
because she was afraid of being deported .
croatia is a dangerous place
for pretty girls
from poor families .
looks like boston was pretty dangerous , too .
two beautiful sisters chasing the american dream .
used to be enough to get you a reality show .
any sign of lea ?
no , but here &apos;s how they got into the country --
they were sponsored by a non @-@ profit .
&quot; samaritan girl &quot; ?
that &apos;s an odd name for a relief agency .
a samaritan helps someone in distress .
if the girl &apos;s getting the help ,
why is she the samaritan ?
shouldn &apos;t you be doing an autopsy
instead of giving a grammar lesson ?
yeah , well , the coroner &apos;s van is stuck in traffic .
which reminds me of boris kerner &apos;s work
on empirical spatiotemporal features of traffic congestion .
it &apos;s
gosh , that &apos;s interesting ,
but we &apos;re trying to figure out who killed the bride .
sorry .
i wonder what anja and lea
were running from in croatia .
&quot; samaritan girl helps young women
get an education and a new life . &quot;
anja got a new life .
it just wasn &apos;t the one she was looking for .
would you take a look at these
and tell us if you know them ?
sure , yeah .
yeah , actually , i recognize both these girls .
we brought them in .
dead and missing ? this is terrible .
has lea contacted you today ?
no , actually , i @-@ i haven &apos;t met either one of these girls .
you just said you recognized them .
well , yes , of course .
i recognize them from their photos .
you see , detectives ,
we arranged for them to get their visas ,
and then we enroll them in an exchange program .
now , three months ago , these girls
flew here from dubrovnik .
we sent a van over to logan to pick them up .
we couldn &apos;t find them .
you &apos;re sure they made the flight ?
yeah .
i mean , the airlines confirmed they changed planes in london
and arrived here in boston .
what do you think happened ?
we bring over a lot of young women here , detective ,
to make sure they have a chance at the american dream .
unfortunately , some do use samaritan girl
as a way to skirt immigration .
frankie &apos;s responding to a 911 call
at seth &apos;s coffee house .
we should get over there . thank you for your time .
no problem .
oh , come on . you know you want some cake .
it &apos;s delicious .
lemon curd with buttercream frosting .
you two , distract her .
why don &apos;t you distract her ?
it &apos;s kind of a big knife .
it &apos;s the cops .
did seth send you ?
does his little croat slut want her cake back ?
too bad . we &apos;re enjoying it .
vicky , drop the knife .
or what ? you gonna shoot me ?
how about you ?
you gonna shoot me , too , officer ?
put down the knife ,
and let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s upsetting you .
what &apos;s upsetting me ?
keep her talking .
me ?
uh , yeah .
what &apos;s upsetting you ?
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s upsetting me --
that croat euro @-@ whore stole my boyfriend !
oh , man , that sucks .
drop the knife , vicky .
i hate lemon curd !
i was voted &quot; most likely to succeed &quot; in high school .
you &apos;re young . there &apos;s still time .
no , i &apos;m not ! my life is over !
you can stop talking to her now .
so , there are three sets of prints on this cake knife .
one belongs to the crazy ex @-@ fiance , vicky ,
and the other to anja , the dead bride .
you said three .
yeah . the third set are partials .
korsak &apos;s working on &apos; em now .
maybe vicky had an accomplice .
odd .
there &apos;s some kind of substance in the wound .
it &apos;s blue .
well , that can &apos;t be the frosting .
that was buttercream .
what kind of cake would you have ?
for what ?
your wedding .
who am i marrying ?
i &apos;m going to have a hazelnut almond ,
chocolate ganache , and maybe mocha buttercream .
maura , you don &apos;t even have a boyfriend .
oh , i &apos;m not getting married .
i just think it &apos;s fun
to play fantasy wedding , don &apos;t you ?
if you &apos;re 5 .
okay .
the edges of the wound are clean .
so , it &apos;s not from this cake knife ?
no . i &apos;ve rarely seen a blade sharp enough to make a cut like this .
what a shame to get married in a polyester blend .
what does your dress look like ?
i don &apos;t wear dresses .
oh , come on .
you must have fantasized about your wedding dress
as a little girl .
yes , once . i had a very high fever .
my gown would be silk charmeuse
with an empire waist and a 20 @-@ foot train .
and the ceremony would be in the cliffs of santorini ,
right above a volcano .
what if the volcano erupts ?
oh , i &apos;d check for seismic activity .
of course .
and i wanted to marry antonio benivieni
when i was 12 .
not antonio !
i hate it when we like the same guy !
he died in the 16th century .
pioneered the autopsy .
i &apos;d be maura
dorthea isles benivieni .
wow . dorthea ? and you laughed at clementine ?
dorthea ? !
i didn &apos;t laugh . i smiled . i liked it .
and i -- and i like that name , too ,
&apos;cause , you know , it &apos;s the name of a famous artist .
oh , my god . you are so weird .
okay . you know what ? fine .
if it &apos;ll move things along , yes .
i was once in love with bill buckner .
and then the ball went through his legs in the world series .
no longer .
can we finish ?
yes .
thank you .
okay .
what is that ?
looks like a copper rivet .
i &apos;ll send it to the crime lab to run some tests .
okay .
oh , it &apos;s korsak .
our suspect , vicky , is upstairs ,
and she will only speak to unmarried women .
well , where do you think you &apos;re going ?
i &apos;m unmarried .
and vicky sounds a little unhinged .
you might need my professional opinion
to help break the suspect .
since when ?
reassure her . compliment her wedding album .
that &apos;s a -- that &apos;s a nice wedding album .
it &apos;s ... not ... a ... wedding ... album !
i &apos;m by myself !
do you see what that slut did to my life ?
do you ?
that was a good idea .
ask her if she has auditory hallucinations .
um ... you ever hear voices ?
you bet i do !
that bitch and her sister
were always talking about me behind my back .
could be brief reactive psychosis .
it &apos;d help to know the event that precipitated it .
you mean the wedding ? that event ?
are you hearing voices , too ?
w-- uh ... yes .
i have a know @-@ it @-@ all in my ear .
you know that anja bitch was a liar , too ?
wh @-@ what do you mean ?
well , she said she was a student , but she wasn &apos;t .
she said she was a virgin , but she was a raging slut .
turn the page . you &apos;ll see .
slut , right ?
agree with her so you don &apos;t inflame her .
yeah , she &apos;s so ... slutty .
she deserved what i did to her .
she feels no empathy for her victim .
i got this part .
you think anja deserved to have her throat cut ?
she &apos;s dead ?
oh , my god ! that &apos;s fantastic !
she suffers from psychotic delusions .
now seth and i can get married !
it is my professional opinion
that she be put under psychiatric observation .
good idea .
jane !
i &apos;m gonna make you eat something green tonight .
okay , i &apos;ll get extra pickles on my burger .
it &apos;s korsak .
still no sign of lea .
wonder if vicky scared her out of town .
you showed up to the guy &apos;s house ?
is that your neighbor , riley ,
sitting with frankie ?
... a sex doll , right ? 
what &apos;s with the suit ?
your interview with cavanaugh isn &apos;t until monday .
i thought i &apos;d break it in .
well , i told him to wear it .
men in suits turn me on .
it &apos;s so cool that you &apos;re about to become a homicide detective .
it &apos;s not a done deal .
hey , thanks again for the bundt pan .
oh , jane , she made the best chocolate cake .
i &apos;ll bring you some .
that &apos;s nice of you .
okay , well , nice bumping into you .
yeah , you , too .
you know , actually , i got to call it a night .
aw , that must be so disappointing for you , riley .
sorry my brother is so crushingly boring .
i think he &apos;s great .
i &apos;ll see you soon , frankie .
yeah .
i &apos;ll see ya .
i &apos;ll see ya .
don &apos;t interfere .
i &apos;m not .
yeah , you are . i really like her .
she feels sneaky to me . i think she &apos;s hiding something .
so don &apos;t go out with her .
good night , maura .
he leaves . she stays .
well , doesn &apos;t that seem kind of ...
kind of ... ?
you &apos;re judging her because she &apos;s sitting by herself in a bar ?
no .
yes .
i got some more info on anja and lea .
vicky was right -- neither of them was going to college .
all right .
hey , uh , you want to sit and have a beer with us ?
uh , no . thanks , though . uh , i &apos;m meeting someone .
see you tomorrow .
yeah . see ya .
she &apos;s hugging him , maura .
look at that !
she &apos;s kissing him !
yeah , i can see that .
okay , she &apos;s not sitting by herself
or keeping her hands to herself .
is it okay to judge now ?
if she was a man , would you judge ?
hell , yes .
i need to tell frankie .
stay out of it .
and i need to tell frost .
stay out of it .
stay out of what ?
jane &apos;s new neighbor is doing darwinian sex selection .
what ? she seemed like such a nice girl ,
even though she has those hideous tattoos .
ma , do you even know what she just said ?
yes , i do .
riley is picking a mate from a big selection .
it &apos;s something you should try .
oh ! a small selection -- frankie or frost .
what a slut !
ma !
excuse me .
morning , lieutenant .
good morning .
i think my mom likes my boss .
i did see them having sex in the lobby .
what ?
that was a joke .
special irish breakfast for you --
it &apos;s steel @-@ cut oatmeal with fresh peaches .
thanks , miss rizzoli . looks delicious .
hey , ma .
frankie !
you look so professional in a suit .
he &apos;s a really hard worker , lieutenant .
ma .
and he studied really hard for the detective test .
ma .
there she goes .
well , there &apos;s only one opening in homicide ,
and she &apos;s trying to help .
yeah , well , she keeps putting peach flowers
on the boss &apos;s oatmeal ,
it &apos;s gonna send him over the top .
frankie , if you &apos;re half as good as
your mother &apos;s cooking ,
you got a good shot , kid .
do you hear that ? i got a shot .
yeah , as long as your mom keeps feeding cavanaugh .
oh , is that suit from the korsak collection ?
riley liked it .
she said it gave me a young al pacino vibe .
okay . you two are idiots .
she &apos;s playing you both .
yeah , we know . it &apos;s all good .
it &apos;s &quot; all good &quot; if my new neighbor sleeps with both of you ?
well , many cultures exchange partners
to indulge in forbidden pleasures .
aw , geez . god .
neither one of us has hooked up with riley yet .
i mean , that would be a total violation of the code .
the man code ? i &apos;ve heard of this .
i @-@ it &apos;s an unspoken set of rules that men live by .
thank you , jane goodall .
so , what , one of these &quot; man code &quot; rules
is until riley does one of you ,
you both go out with her ?
oh , that seems reasonable . what &apos;s another one ?
well , you can &apos;t share an umbrella .
and then if , uh , you &apos;ve known a guy for more than 24 hours ,
his sister is off @-@ limits .
so , jane and detective frost can &apos;t hook up ?
maura !
well , there &apos;s the grenade rule .
that &apos;s a big one . - yeah .
i don &apos;t understand .
a &quot; grenade &quot; is a hot girl &apos;s ...
ugly friend .
you got to jump on that grenade , hmm ?
if it helps your buddy . mm .
helps him how ?
sleep with the hot chick , maura .
oh , fun &apos;s over , kids .
korsak &apos;s got a hit on the third set
of partial prints on the cake knife .
we got a suspect ?
convicted sex offender delivered the cake .
&quot; manny &apos; chatterbox &apos; cruz . &quot;
the bakery know they were hiring a felon ?
yeah . he works for everyman cakes .
it &apos;s a parolee work program .
so , maybe he tried to assault her ,
she fought him , and he slit her throat .
damn , mami .
if i had known homicide cops look like you ,
i &apos;d get arrested more often , eh ?
knock it off !
i kept him cuffed .
he &apos;s known for whipping out his johnson
in mixed company .
did you whip it out in front of the bride , chatterbox ?
and she wasn &apos;t impressed , so you whipped out your knife instead ?
look ... yeah , i delivered the cake .
i saw the bride and that bridesmaid girl , too .
but when i left , they were fine .
i think we just put you at the murder scene .
all right , i confess .
you confess ? to murder ?
hell , no . to sparking up a blunt .
so , you &apos;re getting baked while you &apos;re on parole ?
right outside the chapel .
but when i lit up , i heard screaming .
who was screaming ?
the chicks -- in some crazy @-@ ass language , too .
oh , and i heard some dude , too .
you know , for a minute , i thought my blunt was laced .
did you see anything ?
you gonna help me
with my parole violation if i did ?
maybe .
all right .
i saw some dude dragging that bridesmaid girl to a car .
and you just kept smoking ?
i thought she was his old lady
and he was taking her all caveman @-@ style .
oh , you know what i mean ?
what did he look like ?
i don &apos;t know . uh , like a dude .
white , black , asian ?
what about the car ?
it was a car , man . uh , like a sedan .
no , no , no . maybe an s.u.v.
no . i don &apos;t know .
by that time -- pshew -- i was wasted .
jane , i don &apos;t think lea &apos;s on the run .
i think our killer abducted her .
yeah . we got to find her .
we put out a statewide bulletin .
there &apos;s not a single sighting of lea .
who the hell took her ?
can we just do one thing at a time ?
either talk about the case or move this mattress .
i hate my brother !
oh , well , the good news is
i don &apos;t see any cimex lectularius larvae .
ugh , maura ! you and the bedbugs .
please stop !
that &apos;s riley .
i &apos;m gonna go ask her to help
because it &apos;s her fault that we &apos;re moving this mattress .
yeah , man , i got the cash .
i can do 5k of liquid units .
3 o &apos;clock &apos;s cool . same place .
she just bought 5,000 liquid units .
well , that seems like an awful lot of tattoo ink .
it &apos;s liquid ecstasy .
oh , my god .
a @-@ arrest her .
i can &apos;t arrest her for making a phone call .
maura , my little brother and my partner
are falling for a drug dealer .
i knew it !
you &apos;re in early .
is that someone involved with the missing girl ?
no , this is my new next @-@ door neighbor .
i once had a neighbor who cooked meth in his mud room .
you think she &apos;s cute ?
i mean , if you like that sort of thing . i --
well , frankie and frost are all over her .
they know she &apos;s a drug dealer ?
no , but they will when i tell them .
hey , frankie .
come here . we need to talk .
uh , not now .
cavanaugh called me in for my interview .
any advice ?
don &apos;t choke .
you &apos;ll do great .
you will . come on .
it &apos;s your job to lose , okay ?
you look good .
hey , rizzoli .
not you . the original rizzoli .
in my office , now .
i just got word from the commander of the drug unit
that you ran one of their targets .
one of their targets ? wh-- she &apos;s my next @-@ door neighbor .
oh , y @-@ you &apos;re ordered not to talk to her ,
not to go anywhere near her , in person , or on the internet .
okay .
she &apos;s , um ... dating ... some cops .
cops ? plural ?
yes , sir .
okay , this shouldn &apos;t be too hard .
she &apos;s your neighbor .
so the two guys i can think of is frost and frankie , hmm ?
yes , sir .
i mean , we -- we should warn them .
i mean , maybe she &apos;s trying to get close to them
to get information .
look , i don &apos;t even know what the drug unit &apos;s got goin &apos; on .
all &apos;s i know is that the commander went ape @-@ shit
when you ran that name .
sir , that &apos;s my brother and my partner .
enough !
you are ordered to keep your mouth shut
until they make their move .
we clear ?
yes , sir .
good .
now get back to work .
we got a dead bride and a missing sister .
yes , sir .
of course my partner and my little brother
have to fall for the big drug dealer .
couldn &apos;t fall for the little drug dealer .
wh-- stop worrying .
the man code will prevent them from both hooking up with riley .
that &apos;s so soothing , maura . thank you .
i got to tell them ! what if something happens ?
oh , something will happen if you don &apos;t keep your mouth shut --
you &apos;ll be brought up on charges ,
and frankie &apos;s gonna lose his shot at homicide ,
and frost will get transferred .
okay , well , other than that , what could happen ?
you see this copper rivet that
we found on anja &apos;s wedding gown ?
yeah . so ?
so it has traces of a wheat
containing the sr6 gene .
oh , the sr6 gene. bummer .
do you ever read
the journal of agriculture and food chemistry ?
every issue .
i especially loved the &quot; caption the cartoon &quot; contest .
there &apos;s a caption contest ?
so , the sr6 was a gene cultivated in the 1940s .
if you &apos;re trying to bore me to death , it &apos;s working .
it became an vogue for farmers to use copper tools
after a european ecologist promoted the idea
that iron defertilized soil .
wh-- so , you &apos;re saying
that anja was killed by some old farm tool ?
possibly .
this is a srbosjek knife .
it was used for farming in eastern europe .
so , you &apos;re thinking that the sr6 residue stuff
was on the shop @-@ sheik knife and that &apos;s what killed anja ?
the croatian nazis called it &quot; cutthroat &quot;
because it made it easy to slit the throat of a victim .
what ? where are you going ?
to look at her scalp .
if it &apos;s here , it &apos;d be right ...
if what &apos;s here ?
this .
it &apos;s a cyrillic letter .
they branded her . that &apos;s a &quot; k. &quot;
well , what &apos;s that ?
it means &quot; cutthroat . &quot;
you think that &quot; k &quot; stands for &quot; cutthroat ? &quot;
maybe .
well , anja &apos;s fiance said that she and her sister
were terrified of being sent back to croatia .
well , this tissue is in its last stages of healing .
this is recent .
you mean somebody did that to her here ,
in the u.s. ?
excuse me .
yeah .
i need a speculum .
if she &apos;s been branded ,
she &apos;s almost certainly been raped .
i found substantial scarring on anja &apos;s cervix ,
indicative of recent and repeated rape .
unfortunately , we see this all the time --
young immigrant women ,
they get targeted by human traffickers .
you &apos;re looking at 500,000 , just in this country .
what do you make of that ?
oh , god .
i haven &apos;t seen a mark like that in 10 years .
this looks like &quot; cutthroat . &quot;
well , that &apos;s the serbian nickname for this knife .
it &apos;s possible that a knife like this is the murder weapon .
and &quot; cutthroat &quot; was also a man .
he was a human trafficker
whose specialty was women from serbia and croatia .
but he was killed two years ago .
so , what about the &quot; k &quot; on her neck ?
he used to carve it into the necks of his sex slaves .
may i use your computer ?
y @-@ yeah . of course .
his real name was dragomir lapov .
now , lapov used it on the girls who tried to escape .
slit their throats as a warning to the others .
so , it looks like we have a new cutthroat .
get a new one every day . it &apos;s frustrating as hell .
what will happen to lea ?
my guess ?
she was taken &apos; cause she &apos;s a virgin .
if she &apos;s still alive , she &apos;ll be auctioned off .
how do we find her ?
they &apos;ll want her to go to the highest bidder .
means they &apos;ll have to advertise .
how ? the internet ?
the internet , newspapers .
it &apos;s almost impossible to find them
unless you know where to look .
i ran five different web @-@ bot programs .
searched every inch of local , statewide advertising .
nothing .
maybe they &apos;re taking a page out of the terrorist handbook --
keeping it all low @-@ tech .
i &apos;ll look through the personals .
sounds like you speak from experience .
don &apos;t you remember ? that &apos;s how we met .
either of you see frankie after his interview ?
no .
crap .
that means it didn &apos;t go very well .
&quot; yugo best mechanics . &quot;
i had a yugo .
what do you call a yugo with 1,000 miles ?
an overachiever .
okay , okay , it &apos;s a lousy car .
no @-@ nobody drives them anymore .
how do these mechanics stay in business ?
i think they &apos;re servicing different foreign bodies .
that must be how our killer found anja .
he was looking for his ad
when he saw her wedding announcement .
a cyrillic &quot; k &quot; -- for &quot; cutthroat . &quot;
where &apos;d you get the stun gun ?
i borrowed it .
frost , you go first .
why me ?
you have the stun gun .
now you &apos;ve got the stun gun .
gimme that ! god .
where &apos;s lea ?
she &apos;s not here .
is your team winning ?
boston homicide .
you so much as blink and one of us will blow your head off .
go ahead . shoot me .
you heard the man .
i did .
and i thought eastern europeans were tough guys .
move in now .
police ! hands in the air !
boston police department !
don &apos;t move ! freeze ! you freeze ! right there !
turn around .
joanna , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
these are cutthroat &apos;s girls .
ask her if she recognizes this knife .
she says this is the same kind of knife
cutthroat used on her neck .
does she know these two girls ?
she says they escaped .
tell her that we &apos;re gonna show her all the men .
we need to know if one of them is cutthroat .
no .
so , where is he , and what has he done with lea ?
you &apos;re gonna get fat .
good .
can i get you some chocolate milk ?
yeah .
riley hates fat guys ,
especially ones that drink chocolate milk .
shut up .
i blew my interview , okay ?
what did cavanaugh say ?
he said it &apos;s down to me and one other candidate .
all right ! so , come on .
you &apos;re still in the hunt . frankie .
hey , get your own .
what ? we &apos;re making sure you don &apos;t get fat .
wh-- ooh ! there &apos;s cavanaugh .
let &apos;s ask him .
if you do , i will take this plate
and stuff it down your throat .
hey , boss !
hey . the drug unit made a big bust today .
5,000 units of ecstasy .
wow . nice haul .
move &apos; em up to booking .
oh , my god .
now you know why the drug unit commander
didn &apos;t want you running his target , rizzoli .
what the hell ?
riley is a drug dealer ?
i don &apos;t believe it . i want my pans back .
they &apos;re my pans , ma .
so , you think you &apos;re ready
to be a homicide detective , frankie ?
maybe you oughta investigate the girls you date first .
and you , too , frost .
now , you should know better .
you knew riley was a target ?
frankie , i &apos;m so sorry .
hey , knock it off , frankie .
we &apos;re the ones who blew it , not jane .
frankie , come on .
frost , i &apos;m really sorry .
frankie -- he &apos;s never gonna talk to me again .
the blue residue i found in anja &apos;s throat wound
is methyl isobutyl ketone .
gee , thank you for the sympathy .
i really appreciate it .
well , he &apos;ll get over it .
aren &apos;t you gonna say , &quot; what &apos;s the blue stuff ? &quot;
what &apos;s the blue stuff ?
dry @-@ erase ink .
wh @-@ what &apos;s that doing in anja &apos;s throat wound ?
well , that &apos;s better .
dry @-@ erase markers produce a fine particulate dust
similar to chalk .
so , what ? are we looking for a teacher ?
i mean , who else uses those markers ?
it &apos;s a great writing instrument
for temporary charts , lists , calendars .
lists and calendars ...
where &apos;re you going ?
uh , i need a photo .
what ? jane .
ask her if this is cutthroat .
okay . you &apos;re safe now . he can &apos;t hurt you anymore .
it &apos;s okay .
cutthroat is chris harris .
he got j @-@ 1 visas for anja and lea .
they thought they were coming here to be students .
he brings girls here to sell &apos; em .
so , go get him ! go find lea .
if we move on him now
and lea &apos;s not with him ,
we may never find her .
the girls he brings into the country have no next of kin .
it &apos;s classic predator behavior .
he selected vulnerable girls
that no one would miss .
frost , click on the &quot; upcoming events &quot; icon .
there &apos;s a fundraiser
at samaritan girl headquarters tonight .
&quot; black tie to benefit the &apos; maidens &apos; of the balkans . &quot;
&quot; maiden &quot; means &quot; young and unmarried . &quot;
it also means &quot; virgin . &quot;
you see the fine print ?
&quot; dinner to be followed by an auction . &quot;
can you magnify the bottom of the page ?
it &apos;s a cyrillic letter &quot; k. &quot;
so , maybe lea &apos;s still alive .
what &apos;s the password ?
&quot; cutthroat . &quot;
go ahead .
every so often , it pays to be a middle @-@ aged white guy .
i am so driving on the way back .
evening , sir .
auction is down the hallway .
oh , man !
nice right cross !
yeah ?
nice right cross !
thanks .
gentlemen , we open bids at $ 50,000 .

$ 50,000 .
$ 51,000 !
that &apos;s lea .
$ 52,000 .
ah . do i hear $ 53,000 ?
$ 53,000 .
boston police !
nobody move !
hands in the air !
move in ! move in !
harris , let her go .
come any closer , i &apos;m gonna cut this whore .
you mean the same way you cut her sister , anja ?
shut up !
let me go !
shut up !
shut your mouth !
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s over .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
he killed my sister !
i know . shh . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
come on . come on . let &apos;s get you out of here .
i got her . i got her .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t get too many happy endings on this job ,
so thank you .
how many more are out there ?
there &apos;s too many .
but take a look at those girls , detective .
you just gave them all their lives back .
are you starting to like pinot noir more ?
no .
frost and frankie drank all the beer .
hmm . too bad .
hey , maybe you &apos;ll get a new neighbor
and frankie and frost will help you move this mattress
to your bedroom .
that would be really nice
because the traffic is really loud out here .
you did good work today .
thanks .
at least anja didn &apos;t die in vain , you know ?
lea gets to stay here in boston and go to college .
i just think it &apos;s so disgusting that
they put her in a wedding gown to auction her off .
that &apos;s the part that disgusts you ?
no . all of it disgusts me .
so , you must &apos;ve had a wedding fantasy when you were little .
come on . every little girl has one .
okay , it wasn &apos;t really a fantasy .
it was -- i had this dumb idea
that i would say my vows
at fenway over home plate in a red sox jersey .
it &apos;s not dumb .
it &apos;s not exactly elegant ,
but at least it &apos;s colorful .
and we would have the reception over the pitcher &apos;s mound ,
and we would serve foot @-@ long hot dogs , and frozen lemonade .
and the guests would throw peanuts at us instead of rice .
can i come ?
maybe .
okay .
a red sox jersey ?
okay , you &apos;re in my fantasy .
