feeling the burn , danny ?
no , i &apos;m tasting the burn .
remind me to never eat breakfast tacos before a five @-@ mile run .
actually , we &apos;ve only gone three miles .
you &apos;d know that if you were wearing one of these .
this gives your heart rate , too .
i &apos;m guessing yours is dangerously high .
no , no , my heart &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s my head that needs to be examined .
who talked me into this ? why am i doing this ?
because it &apos;s fun and it &apos;s for charity .
and if by some act of god you manage to finish the race ,
you can feel good about raising money
for the widows and orphans fund , okay ?
well , next time i &apos;ll write a check , how &apos;s that ?
all right , a little less yapping and a little more running .
let me ask you a question .
why are you in the car ?
i just had bone marrow taken out of my body .
how &apos;d you get out of this ?
where &apos;s your empathy , brother ? i got arthritic knees .
besides , i got a note from my doctor .
yeah , how much you pay for that note ?
not a penny .
but he did agree to join my coaching staff .
matter of fact , there he is , right there .
yes , when , uh , captain grover told me that you guys
were participating in the tough mudder charity event
i happily offered my services as team doctor .
i will also be your strength and conditioning coach .
okay , well , you have your work cut out with this one .
no doubt .
and i apologize in advance for what i &apos;m about to do to you .
doctor .
wai ...
hey , hey . jeez !
that &apos;s cold !
okay , stop , max .
ah ! max , cold , cold , cold !
max ! enough , enough !
okay , folks . now that we &apos;ve all been sufficiently saturated ,
welcome to training camp .
tough mudder
is a 12 @-@ mile gauntlet of punishing obstacles
designed to test both your physical and mental strength .
we got the king of the swingers ,
got the funky monkey ,
got the arctic enema ,
and , of course , my personal favorite--
electroshock therapy .
and to answer your question , yes ,
those are live electrical wires .
though i &apos;m told that
the current is perfectly safe for most people .
for most people ? that &apos;s good .
didn &apos;t you do enough of this in buds training ?
what &apos;s this got to do with me ?
all right , folks , we &apos;ve been concentrating on the tough ,
now let &apos;s see what puts the &quot; mud &quot; in mudder .
come on , let &apos;s get dirty .
all right , i &apos;m game .
up , up , up , up . wait a minute , now .
tough mudder is a team sport .
and as we all know , a team is only
as strong as its weakest link .
so , williams , you &apos;re up first .
why ? i don &apos;t want to do it .
he just said he &apos;ll do it . so why are you telling me to do it ?
oh , come on , a little mud &apos;s not gonna kill you , danny .
yeah , you got this , danny .
no , i don &apos;t got it . i don &apos;t want to do it .
all right , what is this , the u.n. ?
i &apos;m giving you to the count of three to dive in the mud
or else everybody gets the hose .
i &apos;ll take the hose .
three , two , one .
all right !
whoa ! go !
come on , williams , get that belly down !
danny , get your face down .
now it &apos;s raining !
come on , danny , get your face down .
it &apos;s raining now .
just tell the truth
and everything &apos;ll work out .
you &apos;ll see .
i love you , daddy .
they &apos;re ready for us now .
we are on the record on october 13 , 2015 .
this is the videotaped deposition
of the defendant , mr. kevin harper ,
being taken according to federal rules of civil procedure
on behalf of the plaintiffs .
sir , will you raise your right hand ?
do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give
will be the truth , the whole truth ,
and nothing but the truth ?
i do .
what the hell ?
what &apos;s that ?
what &apos;s going on ?
somebody call security .
yeah . i &apos;m on my way .
thank you . thanks .
hello ?
hello ?
catherine ?
okay , well , what makes you think it was catherine ?
well , it was an international number
but there was no country code ,
which means the call probably came from a satellite phone .
plus i got two other calls just like it recently .
okay , what if it was doris ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe . but i can &apos;t trace the call anyway ,
so there &apos;s not much i can do .
so the vic &apos;s name is kevin harper .
he was about to be deposed as part of a civil lawsuit
when all this went down .
his wife and his daughter were sitting there in the waiting room ,
saw the whole thing happen right in front of &apos; em .
all right .
killing a guy before he &apos;s about to go on record .
timing can &apos;t be a coincidence .
harper was a defendant in this lawsuit .
he owned a bunch of high @-@ end seafood joints ,
but all his partners and investors sued him
for embezzlement when some money went missing .
right , that &apos;s a lot of angry people .
but why go through the trouble of suing somebody
if you &apos;re just gonna kill him before you get your money ?
well , unless they were trying to stop him
from saying what he was about to say in his deposition .
well , i don &apos;t know , but i tell you what i do know :
harper contracted a private security firm
to seek protection for himself and his family .
they drove him here this morning ,
but they didn &apos;t accompany him upstairs .
okay , so that leaves a @-@ a pocket of time when he was unguarded .
all right , well , aside from the fact that it looks cool ,
why drive a motorcycle through a building to kill somebody ?
fastest way in and out of here .
building protocol demands the entire building
be shut down in the event of a breach .
that includes elevators and exits .
okay , well , if that &apos;s the case ,
how did our shooter get out of here ?
all right , lock down the building now .
vin number &apos;s been removed from the bike .
csu &apos;s gonna take it apart back at the lab ,
see if they can find any identifiers .
well , if our shooter ditched the bike on purpose ,
i &apos;m guessing we &apos;re not gonna find anything .
yeah , we searched the building
and hpd &apos;s canvassing the area ,
but no sign of him .
yeah , he was gone even before the engine even got cold .
well , i &apos;ll keep you posted .
all right , thanks .
you know , i &apos;d say evel knievel did it ,
but he &apos;s been dead for a little while .
well , you know , whoever it was , they needed to be carrying
60 to 70 miles an hour to make that jump .
then they needed to stick the landing
without breaking their face .
given that skill set , i &apos;m guessing that our shooter
was actually a very expensive gun for hire .
yeah , not a lot of margin for error .
somebody went through a lot of trouble to silence our vic .
we &apos;re very sorry to have to put you through this ,
but we need to ask you some questions , okay ?
now , your husband recently contracted a private security company .
was that because he &apos;d been threatened ?
okay , look , we know that your husband
was accused of embezzling money from his business
and there were a lot of angry investors .
mom , you should tell them .
tell us what ? what &apos;s going on ?
uh , you &apos;re right .
my father had received threats .
but not from any of the investors .
kevin was being forced to pay ...
protection money .
forced by whom ?
he said it was the samoan mob .
he had to pay them money every week
just to keep the restaurants running .
so that &apos;s how the money goes missing from the business .
he fully intended to pay all that money back .
but before he got the chance ,
the accountants audited the books .
it &apos;s not like he could tell them where the money was going .
you have to understand .
they threatened kevin &apos;s life , they threatened our family .
but with the lawsuit moving forward ,
we were out of options .
it &apos;s okay .
so let me get this straight .
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s what today was about ?
kevin was gonna come clean in the deposition today
about the protection money , is that right ?
we fully understood what the repercussions of this would be .
that &apos;s why i made him hire the security .
i just ...
i just never imagined that something like this would happen .
listen , we really appreciate your time .
we &apos;re gonna do everything we can to find out
who &apos;s responsible for this , okay ?
all right , i get it .
samoans clip this guy because they do not want him
to go on record about the protection money .
but i got a hunch that they did not do it themselves .
they hired somebody to do it . why ?
they are perfectly capable .
first of all , it &apos;s a way around the security detail .
and second of all , doing it mid @-@ deposition sends a message .
right . you snitch , you die .
chin ho kelly .
how &apos;s it , mike ?
how you doing , man ?
all right .
how you like your new ride ?
well , 120 miles per charge .
zero to 60 in five seconds . it &apos;s not bad .
well , now that you &apos;ve gone green ,
why don &apos;t you reconsider the offer i gave you on that bobber ?
sorry , brother .
that knucklehead &apos;s the first bike i ever got .
she &apos;s not going anywhere .
you never forget your first .
that &apos;s right .
now what can i do for you ?
well , there &apos;s this case i &apos;m working .
wow , that &apos;s one tricked @-@ out crotch @-@ rocket .
any idea where it may have been customized ?
not in any legitimate shop , that &apos;s for sure .
frame sliders , rear handbrakes , slip @-@ on exhaust .
not exactly street legal .
at least once a week , some kid comes in here ,
wants the exact same setup .
why is it in such high demand ?
808 road warriors are a collective of local stunt riders .
they use social media to organize flash mob @-@ style events
where they shut down traffic and perform their tricks .
they have no respect for drivers , pedestrians ,
or clearly , the law .
yeah , i get it , &apos; cause , uh , riding that motorcycle
like a normal person isn &apos;t dangerous enough .
okay , other than these bikes being modified ,
how does this connect to our shooter ?
well , believe it or not ,
these guys are actually linked to a series of truck hijackings .
each job is pulled off by a five @-@ man team of motorcyclists
armed with mac @-@ 11 &apos;s .
well , that &apos;s the weapon our shooter used .
all right , so , the samoans hire these guys
to take out kevin harper .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking , except for the fact that
hpd can &apos;t get a positive id on any of the hijackers .
all they can ascertain is that
they are indeed members of the 808 road warriors .
all right , kono &apos;s working the samoan angle ,
so , until we hear back from her ,
this is our line of attack , all right ?
let &apos;s round up as many of these punks as we can
until we find one that knows something about the hijackings .
one step ahead of you there .
a few of these guys had their bikes seized recently by hpd .
i managed to get them tagged with gps
before they were released from impound .
well , that &apos;s good .
next time one of these things goes down , we &apos;ll be there .
let me ask you something , sista .
does it look like i can ride a motorcycle off a building ?
we &apos;re not saying that you killed him yourself .
we &apos;re just saying you ordered the hit .
and why would i do that ?
because you &apos;re a bagman for the samoan mob .
and kevin harper was about to go on record
that you were extorting money from his business .
bagman ? so you think every samoan
with some ink on their arm is a criminal ?
nice try .
see , hpd &apos;s been up on you for weeks .
and right now ,
they &apos;re decoding what appears to be your ledger .
you recognize that , don &apos;t you ?
so , you understand that with or without his testimony ,
you were going down .
just now , we can add conspiracy
to commit murder to your charges .
i realize i have a credibility problem here .
but you got to believe me .
this , uh , harper dude that you keep on mentioning ,
i &apos;ve never heard of him .
and i sure as hell never had him killed .
i don &apos;t suppose there &apos;s any way you can prove that ?
yup . yup . i got it . thank you .
ciu just finished decoding laulu &apos;s ledger .
kevin harper &apos;s name isn &apos;t anywhere in it .
i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re telling me
the samoans were not taking protection money from him ?
no . according to laulu ,
they stayed away from large businesses .
there was too much risk that the owners would go to the cops .
harper was lying .
yeah , looks like it .
and to his own family , too .
so , the question is ,
what was he really stealing that money for ?
i don &apos;t know , but whatever it was , it cost him his life .
look , daddy . motorcycles !
oh , yeah , there &apos;s a bunch of &apos; em .
whoa ! cool !
that &apos;s awesome !
let &apos;s follow them , daddy .
absolutely not !
that was quite a show , gentlemen ,
and now , to show our appreciation ,
these fine officers will now kindly escort you to jail .
ahe makino ?
you just posted .
all right , boys .
see you on the outside .
all right , all right , all right .
you said i made bail !
oh , he lied .
let &apos;s go .
all right , listen up , ahe ,
&apos;cause we &apos;re about to do you a solid .
right now your boys think you made bail .
yeah , as far as they know , you &apos;re back on the street ,
not in here telling us everything you know
about those trucks that were hit .
why would i know anything about that ?
you know we &apos;re cops , right ?
so we know that you already have a record
for possession and sale of stolen property .
and there &apos;s this other thing .
while you were being processed , hpd searched your place
and found all sorts of merchandise from the hijackings .
all right , look . here &apos;s the deal , right ?
what are you , about a buck ,
50 , dripping wet ?
okay , you don &apos;t match the description
of any of the hijackers , okay ?
this is good news for you .
plus , we &apos;re guessing that you don &apos;t have the balls
to stick your neck out on the line like that ,
which makes you just their fence .
all right , so what &apos;s gonna happen is ,
you &apos;re gonna give us a name right now ,
and you can go home .
okay .
the guy you &apos;re looking for is iceman .
iceman ? like from top gun ?
what &apos;s top gun ?
did he say , &quot; what &apos;s top gun ? &quot;
i should arrest him just for that .
where do we find iceman ?
i couldn &apos;t tell you .
i don &apos;t even know his real name .
that &apos;s convenient .
this ain &apos;t the shriners club .
okay , we don &apos;t have business cards .
you know what the shriners club is , you never seen top gun ?
how do you get in contact with iceman ?
i don &apos;t .
he comes to me when he has stuff to move .
last we spoke , he said he was coming into some laptops soon .
how soon ?
tonight , apparently .
told me to expect them first thing tomorrow morning .
all right , so if this guy is telling the truth ,
there should be a shipment of laptops getting boosted tonight .
right , well , chin &apos;s pulling up cargo manifests right now .
if we can find out which truck the crew is going hit ,
then maybe we can catch these guys in the act , right ?
all right , what &apos;s going on ?
from what we &apos;ve put together ,
harper made nearly $ 800,000 disappear
from the company over the last three years .
guy got pretty good at covering his tracks , too .
i mean , he tried every conceivable trick in the book .
the harpers seem to be living well within their means , though .
no fancy cars , lavish vacations .
so where did all the money go ?
i &apos;m not sure , but at least some of it
was going to this guy-- john messer .
according to the books ,
harper was paying him 150k a year
to consult on the business .
thing is , nobody in the entire company
had ever heard of this guy .
yeah , the checks were being sent to an address on maui ,
where it just so happens ,
a kevin harper was making regular monthly visits .
even though the company
doesn &apos;t have any business interests there .
okay , and there &apos;s no driver &apos;s license or photo id
for this guy on file .
no , just some bank info .
all right , so i &apos;m gonna take a wild guess
and say that this messer does not exist .
all right , you , uh , you come up with a fake name ,
you put it on the payroll ,
and then , you cash the checks yourself .
that would explain why he was traveling to maui so frequently .
yeah , we thought the same thing .
but messer has a legitimate address on maui .
and state records show him to be married
with a couple of kids .
yeah , he may have a low profile ,
but he &apos;s definitely real .
all right , fine .
but let &apos;s talk about the $ 150,000 a year .
nobody does that out of the kindness of their heart .
right ? so , whatever harper was into ,
this guy messer &apos;s involved .
all right , we need to find out who he is
and how he connects to everything .
all right ?
yeah . we &apos;re on it .
just got a hit on the cargo .
shipment of laptops just landed at port .
trucks are being loaded as we speak .
that &apos;s us . let &apos;s go .
get out !
get out of the cab now !
surprise .
lay down on the ground .
keep your hands where we can see them .
down on the ground right now !
keep your hands where we can see them !
get on the ground !
so you &apos;re the iceman , huh ?
you had a good run .
nine hijackings over the last three months .
over a million dollars in merchandise stolen .
it was a good run .
so why don &apos;t you tell me something .
why would you push your luck and try your hand
at murder @-@ for hire ?
that could be anybody .
that bike is customized
exactly the same way as the bikes you and your crew ride .
coincidence .
it &apos;s the same gun that you and your crew use .
look , i didn &apos;t shoot anyone .
not yourself , no , i believe that ,
but here &apos;s the thing . this is my problem , all right .
you got a five man team .
when you hit that truck , you hit it with four guys .
okay , so i &apos;m thinking the missing guy is my guy .
he &apos;s the shooter .
all right , he pulls the hit off , you give him the night off .
tell him to lay low for a while .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
well , i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;m talking about .
i &apos;m talking about you going to prison
for 20 years to life .
as an accessory to murder , all right .
and that &apos;s on top of the hijackings .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
wait , hold up .
suppose i told you that guy acted alone ?
that he was going to hit the truck with us last night ,
but that he called a few hours before
to say he couldn &apos;t make it .
if you want me to give you the benefit of the doubt ,
i &apos;m gonna need a name .
meet tyler kaheaku . 21 years old ,
multiple arrests for armed robbery and assault .
hpd paid him a visit at the hardware store where he works ,
but he didn &apos;t show up this morning .
well , that &apos;s &apos; cause you get a day off after you kill somebody .
so his crew said kaheaku was present
at all of the hijackings
until last night when he bailed unexpectedly .
never give a reason why .
all right , let &apos;s say they &apos;re telling the truth .
is it possible that this was not a hire
and that it was something personal ?
i don &apos;t know . we need to dig into this kid &apos;s life ,
see if there &apos;s any connection to harper .
all right .
so we &apos;ve got a @-@ a ... an embezzling restaurateur
and a juvenile delinquent .
aside from the fact that they are both criminals ,
what do these two have in common ?
i got something .
that was very fast .
this is tyler &apos;s facebook page .
recognize the girl in the photos ?
that &apos;s harper &apos;s daughter .
mrs. harper ,
is , uh , is aubrey around ?
we need to speak with her .
no , i &apos;m sorry , she &apos;s not here .
where is she ?
i haven &apos;t seen her since this morning .
can i ask what this is about ?
yeah , i &apos;m gonna show you a photograph .
uh , do me a favor .
tell me , ever seen this guy before ?
no , i &apos;ve never seen him . who is he ?
okay , his name is tyler kaheaku ,
and he is a suspect in your husband &apos;s murder .
you &apos;re telling me that my daughter
might know the man who did this ?
pretty well .
these are , uh ,
these are photographs from aubrey &apos;s facebook page .
and by the looks of things ,
they &apos;ve been seeing each other for about six months .
oh , my god .
what is it ?
it &apos;s just that , uh ...
aubrey and kevin had been fighting a lot recently .
i assumed it was just the stress that everybody was under
because of the court case and everything .
maybe it was because he found out about the relationship .
it &apos;s possible .
he was always so protective over aubrey .
he probably didn &apos;t want to upset me .
listen , mrs. harper , if aubrey is still hanging out
with this guy , she could be in great danger .
we need to find her right away .
hey , mom .
hey . i &apos;m just checking in .
where are you ?
just out .
what &apos;s up ?
i hadn &apos;t heard from you in a while .
any idea when you might be coming home ?
i &apos;m not coming home , mom .
what do you mean ?
i have to go away for a while .
i @-@ i can &apos;t explain right now .
look , aubrey , whatever &apos;s happening ,
we can get through this together .
dad wasn &apos;t the man you thought he was .
i &apos;m sorry , mom .
call her back . keep trying .
we need to go .
hi , this is aubrey . leave a message .
all right , chin , where are we on the trace ?
i pinged her cell phone to a gas station in waipio
but the signal just died .
she must have dumped it .
they &apos;re going on the run .
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl gets her boyfriend
to kill her own father ? why ?
why would she do that ?
you &apos;re asking me to get in the head of a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl ?
yes . help me with this .
okay . uh , maybe her father found out about the relationship
and told her she had to end it .
no . are you kidding me ?
she &apos;s not going to risk life imprisonment
when she &apos;s a couple of months away
from becoming a consenting adult ?
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i didn &apos;t want to answer the question .
listen . just listen to me for a minute .
let &apos;s break this down .
aubrey told her mother
that her father is not who he seemed to be .
correct ?
okay . i &apos;m thinking she found out
that he lied about the samoans extorting money from the business .
that &apos;s even dumber than what i said .
so , you kill your father ?
no , you just turn him in .
right , right . but what if there &apos;s more ?
what if there &apos;s more to it ?
more to it how ? what ?
okay , well , the father lied about the protection money .
what else did he lie about ?
you keep asking me questions i don &apos;t know the answers to .
then you get upset when i don &apos;t ... - no , it &apos;s rhetorical .
this is how we figure things out .
well , if it &apos;s rhetorical , then i don &apos;t really need to speak .
you know what ? enough .
lisa messer ?
yes .
i &apos;m captain grover with five @-@ o.
this is officer kalakaua .
we &apos;d like to have a word with your husband , john .
is he home ?
um , what &apos;s this about ?
it &apos;s a case that we &apos;re investigating .
we just have a few questions for him and we &apos;ll be on our way .
um , i &apos;m sorry but john &apos;s away on business .
when do you expect him back home ?
uh , soon , hopefully ,
but his schedule &apos;s always changing .
i just put her down ten minutes ago .
oh . i remember those days . please , go ahead .
uh , come inside . i &apos;ll just be a minute .
i &apos;ll be right back .
hey , lou , check this out .
that &apos;s kevin harper .
that &apos;s our victim .
yeah , i think we know what he &apos;s been doing
on all his trips to maui .
so messer and harper are the same guy .
leading a double life .
so sorry about that .
and now , what can i help you guys with ?
okay , that was definitely unexpected .
looked into harper &apos;s travel records .
this has been going on for four years .
he &apos;d spend a week or two with his family on maui
and then say he had business out of town .
now , according to this wife ,
the guy had consulting gigs all over the country ,
so it would be perfectly normal for him
to be gone for long stretches of time .
that &apos;s pretty impressive .
i mean , i couldn &apos;t even keep one marriage together .
this guy was juggling two .
hey , takes a special kind of sociopath
to keep all that stuff separate , man .
i mean , you say the wrong name
at the wrong time , it &apos;s a wrap .
all right , so he &apos;s dipping into the business
to support two families .
once the legal problems started ,
aubrey must &apos;ve realized what was going on .
yeah , you &apos;re a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl ,
think you &apos;re the center of your father &apos;s universe ,
and then you find out something like that .
must &apos;ve left her shattered .
so she gets her boyfriend
to kill her father at the deposition .
makes it look like it was part of the lawsuit .
smart move .
i mean , this way you got the cops
looking into the guy &apos;s business dealings
instead of his personal life .
right , and aubrey gets to protect her mother
from finding out the truth .
all right , we &apos;re heading back now .
see you guys soon .
all right .
okay , so now these kids are on the run .
they probably figure it &apos;s just a matter of time
before the cops are on to them .
apb &apos;s out . unless they &apos;re holed up ,
hpd should get them .
okay . my concern is what these kids are going to do
if they feel like they &apos;re cornered .
got a hit on aubrey &apos;s credit card .
she just booked two tickets to l.a.
plane leaves in an hour .
okay , great . then we move in
when these kids show for their flight .
chin , in the meantime , do me a favor .
call hpd , have them stand down .
i don &apos;t want to give these kids any opportunity
to do anything stupid .
copy .
just drive .
yeah , chin , what do you got ?
bad news . the apb wasn &apos;t updated in time .
aubrey and tyler were just spotted on the h @-@ 1 .
hpd &apos;s already in pursuit .
just go easy . please .
... you &apos;ll soon begin experiencing pain ...
breaking news right now .
a high @-@ speed police pursuit on the h @-@ 1 .
these images coming to you live
from our channel 17 news copter , high over the scene ,
show us what looks like several hpd cruisers currently
in hot pursuit of a motorcycle speeding down the h @-@ 1 highway .
no i.d. has been able to be made as yet ,
but it appears that the rider is male
with a young female passenger .
no official word has come in
if this rider is wanted in connection
to the violent shooting and escape on motorbike
that rocked downtown honolulu ...
... but hpd is advising motorists to avoid the area
if possible until the rider and passenger have been apprehended .
if you &apos;re just joining us ...
would you go easy , please ?
relax . just relax .
what the hell are you doing ? !
if we die , they get away .
you understand that concept ?

well , she &apos;s 17 , yeah , so she &apos;s gonna be tried as a minor .

everything you &apos;ve been through ,
her emotional state ,
the judge might be lenient when it comes to sentencing .

you &apos;re not stretching ?
no . i don &apos;t , uh ... i don &apos;t believe in it .
you don &apos;t believe that stretching before exercise
decreases the risk of injury ?
well , i used to believe that , until i slipped a disc
while stretching one of my hamstrings .
actually , the jury &apos;s still out on stretching .
experts disagree whether it should be performed
before or after the exercise .
see ? listen to the team doctor . he knows .
mahalo .
hey , is adam coming ?
uh , no . he &apos;s still doing pt ,
um , getting back on his feet .
you know , figured it would be cruel
to show him how ambulatory i am .
anything else ?
and with gabriel waincroft still out there ,
i think it &apos;d be safer for him to keep a low profile .
can &apos;t say i disagree with you about that .
you should know something though , kono .
