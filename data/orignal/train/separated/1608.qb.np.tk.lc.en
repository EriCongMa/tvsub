we are not friends . we are colleagues .
having the brca 1 gene
increases my chances of getting breast cancer .
you must be new here .
hey , i &apos;m nick .
that &apos;s gotta be your dad !
that guy said i was supposed to help you .
i don &apos;t want you in my musical ,
but you were hands down the best juliet .
did you talk to anyone about me ?
&apos;cause i just got taken away from my foster family
and put in a group home .
that your brother &apos;s wetsuit ?
do you make fun of all of your students ?
just the most promising ones .
i &apos;m sorry i left without saying goodbye .
but we &apos;ve been iming .
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;ve been talking to , but it &apos;s not me .
we &apos;re leaving .
i can &apos;t run anymore .
a.j. we &apos;re gonna have to take you in for running away .
my name is callie jac ...
uh , adams foster .
sorry . i just got adopted so i changed my name .
uh , i &apos;m here to see a.j. hensdale .
anthony joseph hensdale .
you &apos;re not on his list .
i called and spoke to someone .
i see your request , but you &apos;re not on here .
so what does that mean ?
he doesn &apos;t want to see you .
we &apos;re doing what we call a skin sparing mastectomy .
we remove the nipple and the areola ,
and we take the breast tissue out through here ,
leaving the skin to form an envelope
that will help create the reconstructed breast .
we &apos;ll then insert tissue expanders
underneath the muscles of your chest wall .
all right , now once you heal ,
your plastic surgeon will begin filling them with saline
over the course of six to eight weeks .
any questions ?
mrs. adams foster ?
nope .
how &apos;d it go ?
fine . it went fine .
and when are you gonna ...
um , next week hopefully .
i think we should tell the kids .
no . i think we should just wait till they schedule the surgery .
you know , less time for them to wait and worry , the better .
mama .
are you having an affair with the principal of our school ?
is that why you &apos;re having all of these private conversations
behind closed doors and whispering
and why grandma won &apos;t leave ?
no , i am not having an affair with monte .
where did you hear this ?
it &apos;s all over twitter .
twitter ?
who did this ?
who knows ?
but everyone &apos;s retweeting it .
it is kind of funny .
mom .
no , it &apos;s not funny or true .
just ignore it , okay ?
it &apos;s gonna go away , trust me .
she &apos;s right .
otherwise , it &apos;ll look like she doth protest too much .
one thing i can do is start a twitter campaign
to # stopmakingupliesaboutmymom .
or ...
you know , something better than that .
i &apos;m sorry .
no .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , cal ?
callie ?
did you ...
did you get a chance to see a.j. ?
no , he doesn &apos;t want to see me thanks to you .
okay , cal . listen ...
i told you where a.j. was
because i thought i was talking to my mother , not a cop .
obviously , there &apos;s no difference .
please watch your tone .
i &apos;m sorry if you don &apos;t like my tone ,
but i lost a friend because you weren &apos;t honest with me .
callie .
it &apos;s fine . let her have her feelings .
apparently a.j. is refusing to see mike too .
what &apos;s gonna happen to him ?
well , he may end up in youth authority if he &apos;s not careful .
i &apos;m ...
all right , i &apos;m gonna go change .
well , i believe you have a
call to return ,
so i &apos;ll give you some privacy .
all right , so we &apos;re gonna build a wall over here .
just get me five two @-@ by @-@ fours
and pick the straightest ones .
okay .
where &apos;d you learn to do all this stuff ?
on site , same as you .
you &apos;re gonna place those 16 inches apart on the ground .
we &apos;re gonna build a wall on the ground ?
that &apos;s easier . you &apos;ll see .
did you grow up around here ?
near here .
where &apos;d you go to high school ?
jefferson for a while .
what year did you graduate ?
i didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s cool .
now you think dropping out of high school is cool ?
no , no . i just , i mean no , i just ...
you got a big family ?
look , you ever use one of these ?
no .
this one time , i wasn &apos;t paying attention ,
gun bounced off a stud , hit me in the head .
i got 15 stitches .
so i should stop asking you questions ?
personal ones .
if you wanna learn something , you ask .
all right ? you want to chit chat ,
work with one of the other guys .
yeah , okay . i mean , i want to work with you .
all right , man .
go grab me some more boards .
great . thanks .
your usual ?
sure .
love that last song . what &apos;s it from ?
you know , the brandon foster broken heart collection .
i wrote it for that girl that i told you about .
thanks .
hey , what &apos;d they call this again ?
a shirley temple .
is that , like , a person or ...
wait , you don &apos;t know who shirley temple is ?
no .
she &apos;s , like , the most famous child star of all time .
she sang animal crackers in my soup .
right , so you &apos;re saying this is like a little girl &apos;s drink .
you know , i think it takes a real man to order a shirley temple .
why does this suddenly feel like surfing all over again ?
i think you just like making fun of me . really .
don &apos;t forget you have inventory tomorrow .
yeah . all over it .
aren &apos;t we closed ?
yeah . he won &apos;t let me do inventory during business hours ,
so i get to come in alone
with the ghosts of the early bird special .
wait , is this you think this place is haunted ?
oh , yeah . i know it is .
well , i &apos;d love to see a ghost .
can i help ?
seriously ?
you don &apos;t have better things to do ?
other things to do , but not better .
it &apos;s so professional .
it is .
we &apos;re averaging over 10,000 users a week .
just wait till we launch the phone app .
oh , um , actually ,
i &apos;ve been getting some emails from kids saying that
they have been having some trouble uploading their content
or when they do sometimes , it disappears .
well , i &apos;ll talk to our moderators .
it might be that the content was inappropriate .
we have moderators ?
of course .
okay , it &apos;s just the whole point of &quot; fost and found &quot; is
so that kids have a place to tell their stories uncensored .
moderation isn &apos;t censorship .
it &apos;s a way to keep it a safe place
for kids to speak up and not be bullied or shamed .
for example , someone recently made an ugly accusation about you
and we took it down .
what &apos;d they say ?
that you had sex with your foster brother .
which of course is not true ,
but that &apos;s the sort of thing i &apos;m talking about .
we don &apos;t want people trying to tear you down with lies , do we ?
no .
you know , or misrepresenting themselves .
like whoever &apos;s pretending to be your friend , a.j.
look , i hope you don &apos;t mind .
but i had my programmers track their ip address ,
and it belongs to someone you know .
who ?
your brother , jude .
what are you doing ?
checking my email .
on jude &apos;s computer ?
he said i could use it .
did he say you could use it to catfish me ?
i ...
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
we traced everything back to jude &apos;s computer
and i know it wasn &apos;t my brother .
it was you , wasn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry . i ... i ... i ... i didn &apos;t mean ...
to pretend to be somebody else ?
was it an accident ?
no , it &apos;s just ...
you ... you posted those pictures
and ... and you looked really pretty , so ...
so i was just saying you looked super , callie ,
like the drawing on your wall ...
but you let me sit in a coffee shop waiting for aj .
yeah , i know !
i was there .
you were there , so are ... are you stalking me ?
no , i was just gonna come by to tell you that it was ...
that it was me , and ... and you were talking to this guy
and then you came outside and took off .
okay , mom . i will .
please don &apos;t tell jude .
he won &apos;t be my friend .
are you going ?
yeah .
wait , you &apos;re bleeding .
oh , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s okay .
let me see .
what happened to you ?
i ... i fell .
you didn &apos;t get those bruises from falling .
did you get beat up ?
who did this to you ?
some of the older boys in the group home .
do your supervisors know about this ?
they don &apos;t care .
well , you &apos;re not going back there .
our mom &apos;s a cop . she can help you .
no , no . please , please .
if they can &apos;t find another place ,
they &apos;re gonna put me in juvie .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s okay . it was my fault .
if i ... if i just keep my mouth shut , i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll be fine .
i ... i gotta go .
jude , he &apos;s right .
he can end up in juvie .
mom wouldn &apos;t let that happen .
aj is in juvie right now because of her ,
so we don &apos;t know what she &apos;ll do .
everybody up and out ?
ugh , it &apos;s like herding cats .
you &apos;re not going to work today ?
no . i have a couple of things i &apos;d like to get done before ...
i &apos;m out of commission .
everything &apos;s gonna be fine , you know .
i know , i know .
it &apos;s fine .
yes .
but just in case something does happen , ma ,
i &apos;d like to give you my power of attorney ,
if that &apos;s all right with you .
well ... first of all , nothing &apos;s gonna go wrong .
i know , i know , but i mean , it &apos;s just ... got to be prepared , mom .
why aren &apos;t you asking your wife ?
are you ... are you having problems ?
no .
no ?
no .
is she having an affair ?
no .
mother , we &apos;re fine .
are you sure ?
why are you asking this ?
i &apos;m just saying ,
since i &apos;ve been here , i ...
i haven &apos;t seen much affection between the two of you .
just because you &apos;re in lust with will right now , mother ,
doesn &apos;t mean everyone else is , you know .
well , just make sure that you have sex before the surgery .
mother .
oh , my ...
what ? it &apos;s important .
i know how you get when you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re scared and overwhelmed .
you just want to batten hatches
and weather the storm alone .
don &apos;t ...
don &apos;t make that a self @-@ fulfilling prophecy .
whoa , so your dad &apos;s white , dude ?
birth dad .
so you &apos;re gonna tell him who you are .
uh , i don &apos;t think so .
why not ? is he cool ?
i mean , he &apos;s pretty cool .
so then man up and tell him .
you man up .
sorry . he ... he pushed me .
god , what is your problem ?
you act like you &apos;re nine years old . seriously ,
grow up .
mariana ?
hey , sally .
i &apos;m sorry about the election .
i thought you should have won .
oh , my gosh . thank you .
anyway , i &apos;d love for you to be a part of my administration
as chair of the honor board .
i &apos;d love to .
wow , thank you so much for thinking of me .
thank you ! we &apos;ll talk later .
gotta run .
being chair of the honor board is no honor .
you &apos;re in charge of punishing students .
but hey , if you &apos;re trying to win an unpopularity contest ...
yeah , just don &apos;t expect to get ,
like , another date for the rest of high school .
okay , dumb and dumber ,
don &apos;t you have remedial something to get to ?
you &apos;re not on the visitation list .
all right , well , will you please tell him
that i &apos;ll be back tomorrow ?
i &apos;ll put in your request .
thank you .
o , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight ?
the exchange of thy love &apos;s faithful vow for mine .
uh , can we save the kiss for the performance ?
yeah , that &apos;s , that &apos;s fine .
um , okay . zoey , let &apos;s rehearse the new song .
mat , your shakespeare is so good .
maybe we could get together later
and you could help me with my iambic pentameter .
sure .
so , i was thinking , as director of the play ,
i think you should lay down a no @-@ dating policy
between cast and crew ,
you know , to save the drama for the stage .
right , is that what you think then ,
for the good of the play ?
yes .
no , mariana , no .
if you can &apos;t handle working with mat ,
then we &apos;ll just cast talya as juliet ,
you know , assuming she &apos;s still speaking to me ,
and then you d ...
all right , all right .
don &apos;t get all crazy .
i &apos;m totally fine .
okay . good .
zoey , from the top .

what &apos;s going on ?
this is justina .
she is a foster care advocate
not a social worker or a cop ,
so you can trust her .
hey , jack .
so callie told me what &apos;s been happening in your group home ,
and i &apos;d like to help you if you want me to .
are they beating you up ?
show her .
they are in serious violation of their license .
they could potentially get shut down .
but at the very least , i can get you out of there .
then where will i go ?
someplace safe . i &apos;ll make sure of it this time .
i can get us an appointment at social services tomorrow .
you just have to show them your bruises
and tell them what happened .
she won &apos;t let them send you back to juvie .
okay .
good , are you okay spending one more night there ?
i know how to lay low .
okay .
so i &apos;ll tell callie where and when ,
and i will see you tomorrow .
still want to hang out ?
come on .
sure .
hey , um , sorry ...
what did you mean when you said
you &apos;ll make sure he &apos;s safe this time ?
i thought you had nothing to
do with him getting pulled out of his other home .
well , i didn &apos;t , but someone did last time ,
and i &apos;ll make sure it doesn &apos;t happen again this time .
i mean , it &apos;s just an expression , callie .
i &apos;ll text you later .
is stef upset ?
no , she ...
she knows it &apos;s not true .
well , good .
i think we should just ignore it ,
not dignify it with any sort of response .
yeah , that &apos;s what stef thinks too .
yeah , she &apos;s right .
i mean , kids make up stories about their teachers
and their principals all the time .
when i was in grade school , we spread this rumor
that our music teacher was having an affair with his t.a.
of course in his case it was true
and he ended up divorcing his wife .
but ...
did you send that tweet ?
what ?
do you think i would do something like that ?
no .
i ... i don &apos;t even know why i said that . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just a little stressed out .
about this or something else ?
stef .
i &apos;m sorry .
no .
she ... she ...
she needs to have a surgery . so ...
i &apos;m gonna need to take at least a week off
if that &apos;s okay .
of course .
is it serious ?
she &apos;s ... she &apos;s gonna be fine .
she &apos;s gonna be fine .
i &apos;m so sorry . i didn &apos;t , um ...
i didn &apos;t mean to overstep .
of course you can take all the time off you need .
thank you .
okay , stop it ! i &apos;m gonna throw up !
not until you man up !
okay , okay , okay !
i &apos;ll do it , i &apos;ll do it ! just stop !
you are such an ass .
someday you &apos;re gonna say ,
&quot; thank you , nick . because of you ,
i have a relationship with my father .
uh , birth father . &quot;
yeah , we &apos;ll see .
you guys want to get out of the car ?
0.5 .
0.5 .
having fun yet ?
well , i mean , don &apos;t most places use , like , a computer for this ?
most places aren &apos;t stuck in the 1940s .
speaking of which , where are all those ghosts ?
oh , that &apos;s weird . maybe they don &apos;t like you .
what is not to like ?
i agree .
wait a minute .
what ?
no , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m picking up on , like , a presence .
it &apos;s a little girl .
she &apos;s got curls ...
a high @-@ pitched voice , and she &apos;s ... she &apos;s calling me .
i have to ... i have to ... i have to go .

you are ... pretty adorable .
sorry .
no , it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t want to kiss you .
it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s complicated .
why ?
well , first of all , i &apos;m older than you .
by a few years . no big deal .
and we &apos;re both on the rebound .
i thought you were over your ex .
i am ,
but it &apos;s pretty clear that you aren &apos;t of yours .
uh , yeah , you know , go back there and help
and i &apos;ll be back there in a little bit .
nick .
thought you might not show up today .
yeah , sorry about that .
i had something after school .
um , school ?
you a senior ?
yeah .
um ... let &apos;s get to work .
here .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s my old belt .
try it on .
it &apos;s not safe to walk around with tools in your pockets .
hey , just the girl i wanted to see .
yeah , right .
no , seriously . i wanted to apologize .
look , i &apos;m just trying to fit in , okay ?
it &apos;s hard coming to a new school junior year .
i was just trying to make a friend
by acting like a smart @-@ ass and teasing a sister ,
&apos;cause i like you
and you intimidate me .
why ?
you &apos;re smart . confident .
i am ?
you &apos;re just about the most beautiful girl i &apos;ve ever seen .
and now that i &apos;ve made a complete idiot of myself ,
maybe we can go out sometime , get some fries or something ?
maybe .
i &apos;m making spaghetti and meatballs for dinner .
i hope that &apos;s okay .
that &apos;s fantastic . thank you .
nothing &apos;s gonna happen , but i just want you to know
that whatever decisions might need to be made ,
of course we would ... we would make them together .
about what ?
didn &apos;t stef talk to you about her power of attorney ?
yeah . yeah .
oh , good .
because she said she was gonna go over to the school at lunch .
i thought i might have put my foot in my mouth again .
so you &apos;re all right with everything ?
not to worry .
oh , good , because i don &apos;t want there to be
any tension between us .
it &apos;s all good .
thank you for making dinner .
i &apos;m just gonna go wash up .
take your time .
i got everything under control .
you okay ?
i didn &apos;t sleep well last night .
is there anything i can do ?
just need some rest .
okay .
why do girls inflict so much pain on themselves
just to look pretty ?
well , we can &apos;t all rock a unibrow .
what ? i do not have a unibrow .
whatever you have to tell yourself .
you ever been curious about our birth dad ?
why ? are you ?
i don &apos;t know .
do you ever think he might not have been latino ?
no .
why are you thinking about our birth dad ?
you &apos;ve never been interested in knowing anything about him .
i don &apos;t know . nick was asking questions .
well , you don &apos;t have to answer them .
tell him it &apos;s personal .
yeah , well , speaking of nick , i know you hate him , but ...
he &apos;s not so bad .
well , good , because he just got busted
for doing donuts in the school parking lot
and he &apos;s being sent to your honor board tomorrow ,
so go easy on him , okay ?
sure .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
i told you i needed the car after school today .
uh , i don &apos;t remember that , and actually i need it
to get to work after rehearsal .
well , the car doesn &apos;t belong to you .
we all have to share it and you have it most of the time anyway .
well , what &apos;s so urgent ?
are you gonna go see your boyfriend in juvie ?
he &apos;s not my boyfriend and
he &apos;s probably not even my friend anymore
and you &apos;re supposed to be moving on , brandon .
i am .
oh , yeah ?
is that why you &apos;re doing romeo and juliet as your senior project ?
what does that mean ?
can i please just have the keys ?
so everyone , this is nick stranos .
he was doing donuts in the school parking lot .
do you have anything you want to say ?
yes .
it &apos;s hard coming to a new school junior year .
i guess i was trying to make a friend by showing off ,
but all i showed was what an idiot i am .
now , i like it here .
it is the most beautiful school i &apos;ve ever seen
and i am very , very sorry for my actions .
well , i think since this is your first offense ,
we can let you off with a warning . mariana ?
i agree .
as long as he cleans up
the tread marks that he left behind .
inside are soap and scrub brushes ,
and since you &apos;re gonna be spending a lot of time on your knees ,
i &apos;ve included these .
good job .
yeah . i can &apos;t believe we framed the whole room in a day .
it &apos;s pretty cool .
yeah . well , you &apos;re a good worker , nick .
we &apos;ll see you tomorrow ?
yeah .
all right , bud .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not nick .
can ...
my name &apos;s not nick .
i &apos;m jesus ...
your son .
and look , i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell you right away .
i just wanted to get the chance to know you ...
you gotta leave .
why ?
i can &apos;t be around you .
oh , no . you don &apos;t have to worry .
it &apos;s not like i want anything from you .
no , i can &apos;t legally be around you .
don &apos;t come back here again .
here he is .
what happened to your arm ?
they took me to the hospital . i told the doctors i fell .
well , did those boys do that to you ?
did they break your arm ?
as long as i don &apos;t tell ,
they &apos;re gonna give me my own room and food and video games
anything i want .
and they &apos;re gonna protect me now .
they won &apos;t protect you .
yes , they will .
i finally have the power
for the first time since i &apos;ve been in the system .
i have the power .
thank you anyway .
hey , jack !
hey , what about the other kids in the home ?
if you protect the people that let this happen to you ,
you &apos;re not gaining any power .
you &apos;re giving it up for every kid in foster care .
i &apos;m really sorry i pretended to be your friend .
it &apos;s okay .
if i let them take me out of this home ,
they &apos;re just gonna put me in another one
where i won &apos;t have any control , so i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t get it .
some people don &apos;t want to be saved .
everyone wants to be saved .
they just sometimes need permission .
thanks for the kneepads .
obviously you &apos;re off the hook for those fries .
although , i know it wasn &apos;t a serious offer .
who says ?
i &apos;d still like to take you out sometime .
i &apos;ll even let you borrow these .
oh , you &apos;re disgusting !
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry !
look , i don &apos;t know why i do that around you , okay ?
you make me say stupid things .
oh , so it &apos;s my fault ?
yes !
yes , because you really are so freaking hot .
fine .
what ?
i &apos;ll go out with you .
uh , when ?
i don &apos;t know .
text me .
what are you doing ?
um , getting my affairs in order .
it &apos;s not funny .
well , i really do think that we need to update our wills ,
and i &apos;d like to talk to you about brandon
having access to his hand money when he turns 18
just in case anything happens to the both of us .
and there &apos;s one more thing
that i would like to discuss with you .
your power of attorney .
sharon mentioned it because
she thought you came to my school yesterday to talk to me .
uh , i did come by actually ,
but you were ... you were in your office
alone with monte with the door closed
so i thought i would just would ...
when are we ever gonna get past this ?
i &apos;m trying to , lena .
by giving sharon your power of attorney ?
i did that
because i don &apos;t want you to have to make the decision
to pull the plug ...
if ... if it comes to that .
or maybe you &apos;re afraid i &apos;ll pull it
because you &apos;re convinced i &apos;m in love with monte .
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t think you &apos;re in love with her .
but ...
what if you ...
what if you fall in love with her because i &apos;m ... i &apos;m ugly ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m ...
what are you talking about ?
lena , you didn &apos;t want me to get the mastectomy because ...
you were worried about our sex life and our intimacy
and i might not like the way i look ,
that you might not like the way i look .
honey , i said that when you didn &apos;t need the surgery ,
when i was trying to talk you
out of doing something that wasn &apos;t necessary ,
when having it wasn &apos;t potentially going to save your life .
this is different .
the result is the same .
you know , i &apos;m gonna have scars
and i &apos;m gonna have hard , artificial breasts
that i can &apos;t even feel .
i won &apos;t have nipples unless i get them tattooed on .
i won &apos;t be beautiful like monte .
i &apos;m ... i just ... i won &apos;t .
and you know , i don &apos;t care about the surgery .
i &apos;m not afraid of this , that i don &apos;t ... i &apos;m ...
i ...
you &apos;re not going to lose me .
and what &apos;s beautiful about you is so much more than your body .
it &apos;s your heart and soul .
your mind .
your laugh .
your ... your courage and your compassion .
honey , i love this life that we &apos;ve built together .
our kids .
our family .
you &apos;re my home .
and i &apos;m so sorry that i said anything
that ever made you feel like i wouldn &apos;t ...
i always find you attractive and sexy and beautiful
because i will .
i mean , i always will .
i ...
i &apos;m scared .
it &apos;s okay to be scared .
what can i do for you ?
how can i help ?
you can ...
take me swimming ?
you look like ...
i just walked here .
yeah , i did .
my sister needed the car .
but it gave me a chance to think about what you said ,
and yes , i am getting over someone ,
and sometimes that &apos;s easier to do
when someone else comes along ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean that
that person is the rebound person , okay ?
that person can also just be the one .
you know , like when romeo thought he was in love with rosaline ,
but he was until he met juliet .
and then they killed themselves .
well , yeah , but they were still meant to be .
so what if it &apos;s complicated ?
do you have a ... car seat ?
yep .
i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;re , like , a nanny , right ? right ?
no , i &apos;m a mother .
i have a two @-@ year @-@ old son .
when i told you things were complicated ,
i didn &apos;t just mean your side of things .
well , uh ... i ...
i think you should probably take some time and ...
think about how much complication you can really handle .
callie adams foster ,
ok , you &apos;re on the list .
thank you for seeing me .
a.j. won &apos;t see any of us .
what do you want me to do ?
give him permission
to have a foster family that loves him
and will take care of him until you &apos;re out of here .
are you crazy ?
how long have you been working with him ?
just a few days .
okay , but why would he say that he couldn &apos;t be around me legally ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe ana took out a restraining order against him .
can everyone come downstairs please ?
does anybody have any questions ?
how long are you gonna be in the hospital ?
just a few days .
are you ... will you be okay after ?
yeah . oh , yeah .
yeah , that &apos;s why i &apos;m doing this .
so that , um ... make sure i &apos;m okay for a long time .
what can we do ?
how can we help ?
well , you can ... you can ...
make sure you do your chores and ...
and fold your own laundry , and that would help a lot ,
and , um ...
i think ...
stay close .
that would be great because i think , um ...
you know , being together as a family ,
that &apos;s probably more healing than any medicine .
hey , group hug , huh ?
all right , my babies .
come on .
what are we doing ?
this is trespassing .
they &apos;re out of town .
what if somebody calls the cops ?
you are a cop .
oh , my god , babe .
what ?
you asked me to take you swimming .
okay , we don &apos;t have suits , lena .
come on .
who needs suits ?
oh , this is so on .
all right .
okay .
think you can outdo me ?
last one in is on top tonight . oh !
