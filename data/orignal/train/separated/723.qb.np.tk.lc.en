第四季 第二十集
i am amanda clarke .
&quot; what kind of detective doesn &apos;t know the real name
the woman at he &apos;s been dating ? &quot;
the thing with louise -- it &apos;s not a traditional marriage .
then why lie to her ?
emily and nolan are strangers to honesty .
there &apos;s so much more you don &apos;t know .
i want the truth .
i ran a diagnostic . files were copied .
do you have any idea what you &apos;ve exposed me to ? !
the whole world is dying to hear your story .
victoria schemed , plotted , and railed
against me , my friends , and loved ones .
amanda clarke has dug a grave for me tonight .
this story will never end .
as if this last week hasn &apos;t been hard enough ,
the press seems to have an insatiable appetite to eviscerate me .
well , i &apos;m doing everything i can to tell your side .
ohh , it &apos;s merely screaming in the wind , margaux .
but i hate seeing you endure these attacks .
it &apos;s too hard for anyone to bear , even you .
which is why she has me .
what is she doing here ?
i invited her .
victoria , i beg you ,
do not let that woman into your life .
well , someone has to lighten the mood around here .
you &apos;re about as depressing as a yankee groom
at a southern wedding .
you tried to kill me , you lunatic .
okay , whatever did or did not happen
was due to the fact that my family was drugging me .
former family .
victoria , please , you don &apos;t need her kind of help .
oh , the hell she doesn &apos;t .
you have her holed up in here , hiding from the world .
that is not how you handle a scandal .
you face it with your head held high .
you do not act like a guilty person .
oh , no , just like a crazy one .
stop it !
if i am to survive this , i need both of you .
now , can you do this for me or not ?
oh , victoria , you know you will always have my support .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry about that .
sometimes , i just can &apos;t stop my lips from flapping .
don &apos;t worry about margaux .
she doesn &apos;t understand what it means
to be the target of ugly headlines .
and that &apos;s a club that both you and i have membership to .
and the last one that will ever have me , i &apos;m sure .
that doesn &apos;t sound like the victoria i know .
louise . perhaps you &apos;re right .
maybe i have been hidden here for too long .
would you please take me to lunch ?
oh , with head held high .
i heard you were doing this .
wanted to pay my respects , but i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to intrude .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
for half her life , you were the only family amanda had --
emily had .
that &apos;s gonna get complicated .
you always had a way with understatements .
so , stevie &apos;s changing carl &apos;s birth certificate , too ?
yeah , yeah .
once my mom gets an idea in her head , there &apos;s no stopping her .
she and your dad are meeting today .
yeah , he told me .
i guess she needs him to legally verify that i &apos;m me .
right .
complicated .
well ... it &apos;s all a good thing .
it &apos;s a chance to start living honestly .
well , you were always better at that than me .
maybe .
but now that this is over , there &apos;s nothing stopping you .
almost over .
victoria still has the drive with the evidence on me .
she hasn &apos;t made a move yet ,
which means she &apos;s planning something .
i have nolan tracking it .
well , you guys will figure something out .
you always do .
jack .
when i get this evidence back , i &apos;m done ... for good .
thanks for coming today .
what about that one ?
not really my type .
that one is definitely mine .
come on , tony . you could totally rock an asaf ganot .
first off ,
i can &apos;t believe that - i &apos;m shopping at a runway show .
and , second , what &apos;s wrong with my suit ?
you have to kind of trust me on this one .
you &apos;re already sponsoring my work &apos;s charity event .
that &apos;s huge .
and it &apos;s my pleasure .
if you want to raise money in the hamptons ,
you have to dress the part , sir .
i just don &apos;t like you buying me things , nolan .
okay ... okay . fine .
look , we wear the same size .
i &apos;ll buy , you borrow .
tony , your work &apos;s important , and , you know ,
i want to be involved in some small way if i can .
besides , it &apos;s , uh ... it &apos;s nice to feel useful .
you haven &apos;t smoothed things over with emily yet ?
i mean , uh ...
we &apos;ve talked since our little dust @-@ up , but , uh ...
only about stuff , you know , that needs to be handled
since her coming @-@ out party .
everything is fixable .
that &apos;s actually debatable .
what &apos;s not debatable is that you guys are best friends
who aren &apos;t talking about anything real .
you need to air this out .
you so don &apos;t know ems .
she &apos;s not a &quot; share her feelings &quot; kind of girl .
then there &apos;s the problem . and i hate seeing you this way .
you &apos;re a great guy with a good heart ,
which is the real reason i came today .
it wasn &apos;t for the suits .
you know , before lunch , we should stop at tiffany &apos;s .
&apos;cause nothing cures the blues like a little blue box .
the car &apos;s not here .
oh , i &apos;m sure they &apos;re just late .
this was a mistake .
oh , no , you &apos;re just getting spooked .
louise , would you find the car for me , please ?
sure .
be back in two shakes .
victoria !
get her help ! call 911 !
oh , my god ! victoria ! are you okay ? !
did you see his face ?
what is it ?
it was emily .
第四季 第二十集
call me right away if you have any dizziness , mrs. grayson .
and watch your step . that was a nasty fall you took .
well , that seems to be a recurring theme for me these days , doctor .
thank you so much for your help .
you didn &apos;t tell him what happened ?
i don &apos;t want to discuss it .
but emily attacked you .
we don &apos;t know that for sure .
i may have been mistaken earlier .
it &apos;s the only thing that makes sense .
she &apos;s trying to steal back the evidence you have .
she didn &apos;t get it , did she ?
no .
it &apos;s the only leverage i have left .
well , it &apos;s only useful if you use it .
louise , you don &apos;t understand .
i know what she &apos;s done to you ,
and i know you must be scared .
but the police will believe you
once they see what &apos;s on that drive .
the truth is on your side , victoria .
why won &apos;t you use just it ?
she wants me to try to use it
so she can take it away from me .
that &apos;s what she does .
she manipulates her targets before they realize it ,
and then it &apos;s too late .
she &apos;s taken everything away from me
my son ... his child , charlotte .
she will not stop until i &apos;m dead ,
and i refuse to give her that satisfaction .
margaux was right .
i should never have left this room .
victoria .
just go .
i knew you were out .
just wanted to check your security program
to see if we located the drive .
well , victoria hasn &apos;t plugged it in in the last week .
well , good news , she hasn &apos;t played that card .
bad news , we still don &apos;t know where it is .
okay .
well , i &apos;m sorry to intrude .
good talk .
what do you want me to say , nolan ?
i don &apos;t know . anything ?
i don &apos;t want to fight .
i don &apos;t want to fight , either , but maybe we should ,
because then at least i &apos;d know how you feel .
you kept files without telling me ,
and now victoria has them .
this is my nightmare . how do you think i feel ?
i know . i know .
i &apos;m terrified that everything is about to come undone
because of me .
and trust me , ems , that is my nightmare .
because ... this has been the best part of my life .
that &apos;s why i held onto that stuff .
it was my infinity box .
and it &apos;s why i still call you ems
even though the rest of the world knows your real name .
i hate that i failed you .
i don &apos;t want to lose you .
you know , sometimes , i &apos;m so focused on the fight ,
i don &apos;t see what &apos;s right in front of me .
i should have seen that you were hurting , too .
i mean , yeah , i &apos;m pissed , but you &apos;re not gonna lose me .
we &apos;re a team .
we &apos;re gonna get through this , &apos; cause that &apos;s what we do .
nice suit .
david .
stevie .
we had an appointment , david . i waited an hour .
i called twice . what happened ?
i guess my phone battery must have died .
i &apos;m glad i tracked you down .
before i leave tonight , i need all the documentation
regarding carl &apos;s mother &apos;s name signed .
there &apos;s a lot of details that suddenly need to be rectified
in light of your daughter &apos;s announcement .
wait , is that another attack on amanda ?
it &apos;s a legal observation .
well , i don &apos;t appreciate it .
believe me , david , i don &apos;t want to spend my last few hours
in town fighting with you again .
don &apos;t , then . just go .
this is important .
to you .
not everything revolves around stevie grayson .
where is this coming from ?
carl has lots of time to learn the truth .
hell , up to a year ago , he would have
gotten his own grandmother &apos;s name wrong .
so just do us a favor ... drop it .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s causing you to act like this ,
but it sure as hell isn &apos;t me .
return these before i leave .
but after you deal with whatever it is
that &apos;s making you act like an ass .
this is good together .
that one over there , i think it &apos;s a mistake .
yes . thank you .
i got your message . you wanted to see me ?
oh , far from it ,
but victoria &apos;s current situation requires i do .
what will it take to make you go away ?
well , just a minute , now . you can &apos;t buy me off .
i do not like you , i do not trust you ,
and i will do whatever it takes
to cut you out of victoria &apos;s life
before your reckless behavior puts her in danger .
what happened ? tell me .
victoria was attacked earlier .
well , she said nothing to me .
well , she &apos;s pretty shook up .
truth be told , i figured that &apos;s why you called me here .
i thought you might be just as concerned as i was .
how did this happen ? what did you do ?
i thought i was helping .
it was emily .
she &apos;s clearly trying to steal back that drive .
yes , ma &apos;am ?
simone , call my car .
and get me the number of that agent at the fbi ... agent baker .
victoria said she doesn &apos;t want to involve the feds .
no , i will decide what &apos;s best for her from now on .
well , what can i do to help ?
stay out of my way .
ben . hi
did you have a good swim ?
did a loop around pennfeld .
lighthouse ? that &apos;s like three miles .
helps me focus
when i &apos;m dealing with a lot of things .
three miles is a lot of things .
given what went down with us ,
you don &apos;t think maybe we need to talk about it ?
look , ben , you don &apos;t know what i &apos;ve been through ,
what i &apos;m going through .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t .
but i do know that i &apos;ve put my career and my life
on the line for you ...
because for reasons that i can &apos;t fathom right now ,
i really like you , and i want us to work .
but if you don &apos;t , just be honest ,
&apos;cause i don &apos;t want to be that guy with you .
no , it &apos;s not that .
look , it &apos;s that i don &apos;t want to be that girl with you .
and who &apos;s that ?
someone who puts you in a position
where you have to lie again ,
especially when you &apos;re doing the job you &apos;ve always wanted to do .
it &apos;s just ... it &apos;s not fair .
why don &apos;t you let me decide what &apos;s right for me ?
i need to put all of this behind me first .
can you give me a little more time ?
all you had to do was ask .
i &apos;m guessing i don &apos;t want to be here for that call .
look , why don &apos;t you come back later ?
we &apos;ll talk more then , okay ?
nolan , do you have something ?
things have gotten harry ... as in &quot; s truman . &quot;
they &apos;re about to drop the big one .
i intercepted a phone call between margaux and victoria .
they &apos;re using the evidence .
the feds are on their way to victoria &apos;s hotel .
it &apos;s going down now .
margaux arranged for the fbi to question victoria
at the penthouse .
it &apos;s a smart move on her part ...
no chance for us to intercept them ,
and she knows that we don &apos;t have enough time
to pull off an &quot; emily &apos;s eleven &quot; and break into the suite .
victoria won &apos;t let the drive out of her sight
long enough for us to take it , anyway .
yeah , but we have to .
i mean , it &apos;s not like before . we can &apos;t erase it remotely .
and , em , if the feds get their hands on this evidence , it --
we &apos;re not gonna let that happen , remember ?
is that what i asked for ?
yeah , graphite scanner , like the ones airports use
to search for chemical explosives .
i modified it to search for the coating agents
used on thumb @-@ drive actuators .
good . i better get moving .
i guess i &apos;ll call tony
and , tell him i can &apos;t make it to the charity event .
no . i &apos;ll handle it .
i didn &apos;t mean it like that .
look , the past few years , this has been our life .
whether we want to admit it or not ,
it &apos;s been easier to focus on the mission
than to think about what comes next .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
i hate imagining life after ems .
you don &apos;t have to .
there &apos;s always gonna be a &quot; nolan and emily . &quot;
but &quot; nolan and tony &quot; might not have a chance
if you stand him up today , and i &apos;d hate to see that happen .
i hear he &apos;s a really great guy .
go finish this , ems .
you never stop working .
not when there &apos;s work to be done .
listen , i , about that ...
i brought the papers and an apology .
you were right . it wasn &apos;t about you .
i &apos;m sorry .
appreciate it .
despite my reputation , i do know how to listen .
want to talk about it ?
it started that day , uh , on the boat , when i cut my hand .
at the hospital , they ran my blood work .
&quot; it &apos;s a normal procedure , &quot; they said .
the tests , uh , they came back abnormal .
it &apos;s lymphoma .
oh , david , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
do they know ...
the prognosis ?
they said they got it in time , that they want to be aggressive .
i start chemo tonight .
looks like that fight we had was a blessing in disguise .
how &apos;s your daughter taking it ?
you haven &apos;t told her .
it was only confirmed this morning .
that &apos;s why i was in no state to make our meeting .
i &apos;m gonna tell amanda later .
i @-@ i just ... i don &apos;t know how she &apos;s gonna take it .
i wouldn &apos;t worry about it too much .
you have the toughest kid on the block .
emily thorne is no hero .
she is a criminal who thinks she &apos;s above the law .
when you say &quot; emily thorne , &quot; you mean &quot; amanda clarke , &quot; correct ?
by any name , she is a dangerous woman .
she attacked victoria this morning .
so you said on the phone .
but when i checked with the doctor ,
he told me that mrs. grayson claimed she fell .
well , that was a cover story
to protect herself from retaliation .
emily is a compulsive woman . she tapped phones .
she posed as a homeland security agent .
she threatened my father , and now he &apos;s dead because of it .
we cannot let her go on torturing us like this .
mrs. grayson , you provided vital evidence to the bureau
against your ex @-@ husband in the past .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m taking this as seriously as i am right now .
but i can &apos;t help you if you refuse to cooperate .
victoria , we can end this .
show him the evidence .
that &apos;s the fire alarm . we need to evacuate .
no , there is no fire . this is emily .
she wants us out of this room .
you think i &apos;m letting you stay up here based on your hunch ?
here .
hold onto it , and don &apos;t let anybody near you .
let &apos;s go , ladies .
come on . we need to keep moving . let &apos;s go .
i don &apos;t like being out in the open , agent baker .
she can get to us here .
look , calm down , mrs. grayson .
i can assure you i have not seen her .
you don &apos;t understand .
she will take the evidence away from you .
i have it right here .
it &apos;s gone , isn &apos;t it ?
i must have dropped it in the stairwell .
no , you didn &apos;t drop it .
it was amanda clarke , and we played right into her hands !
she took the evidence ! she took it !
s @-@ s @-@ she knew you were coming . she tapped my phones .
she set off the alarm . d @-@ don &apos;t you get it ?
amanda clarke is here . please , you got to find her .
you got to find her .
it &apos;s okay .
she &apos;s here !
don &apos;t let her get away !
victoria .
what ?
we &apos;ll find her .
ah , amanda . thanks for coming .
i wanted to talk to you .
wait .
something is different . what is it ?
it &apos;s over .
what is ?
everything ... this whole damn war .
victoria was gonna use this today ...
the last piece of leverage she had on me .
you know what this means ?
finishing this isn &apos;t just a fantasy . it happened ...
today . i ...
for the first time in my life ,
there are no more battles to fight .
you wanted to talk to me ?
i wanted to tell you i loved you
and that ...
i am so very proud of you , amanda .
it &apos;s a wonderful event , mr. ross .
cheers .
what inspired you to do this for my star employee today ?
actually ... i never really had a relationship with my father ,
not a good one , anyway .
and as a result , i grew up an angry young man
who had his fair share of problems ,
made mistakes , and ...
until i met somebody who finally decided to believe in me .
david clarke ... i &apos;ve heard you speak about him .
changed my life , much like your program must do
for kids facing similar situations , problems .
that &apos;s why i decided to host this event .
tony .
and we &apos;re very grateful for that .
and how did you two come to meet ?
oh , juicy question .
you want to field it , or should i ?
louise . what are you doing here ?
oh , i &apos;m just contributing to the conversation .
my ex @-@ husband here does weave such delightful tales ,
doesn &apos;t he ?
but i have to warn you , they are more fiction than fact .
and you will have to excuse my ex @-@ wife .
she held so much promise ... once .
what are you after ?
you .
now , we can do this right here
in front of your new paramour &apos;s employer ,
or we could go someplace private and have a frank conversation .
you , me , outside , five minutes . do not make a scene .
now , why would i ever do that ?
oh , no , clumsy me .
and all over your brand @-@ new asaf ganot suit ,
which costs more than the donation i made
to your foundation earlier today .
you know , social work must be much more lucrative
than i was led to believe .
l @-@ louise , stop it .
unless ... your foundation wasn &apos;t the sole beneficiary
of my ex @-@ husband &apos;s charity .
well , now i see why
you were so intent on getting a quickie divorce .
good on you .
wreck a marriage , get a sugar daddy .
now , that &apos;s not true .
i &apos;m so sorry .
excuse me . i &apos;m sorry .
you know , i didn &apos;t think that you were a lost cause until right now .
tony was an innocent in all this .
how could you do that to him ?
you hurt my friends , i hurt yours .
oh , listen to you ... considering victoria a friend
and taking a page out of her playbook ?
more like emily , if you ask me .
hey , she never went after anybody that did not deserve it .
oh , don &apos;t romanticize her !
she gets off on torturing victoria ,
just like she did today in that garage .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
oh , more lies !
i know you helped her steal that drive back ,
and i know that this charade of an event is your alibi .
plausible deniability while emily does her dirty work .
oh , wow , you &apos;re good , except for those pesky details .
oh , don &apos;t stand there and play dumb .
you are kicking victoria while she &apos;s down .
what do you think that will do to her ?
why don &apos;t you just be a man and admit to what you &apos;ve done ?
louise , you &apos;re in over your head ,
and you picked the wrong side .
oh , and while you were trying to record a confession
on your phone right now ,
i was running an app that reset it to factory settings .
like i said ... you , head , over .
轻触以开始
up the hill .
you want me to do this side ?
here we go . here we go .
this goes up .
look here .
all this just to change a mother &apos;s name , huh ?
you &apos;re lucky you get the family discount .
i usually charge by the pound .
well , thanks for taking care of all this .
maybe i should stick around .
oh , you don &apos;t need to worry about me .
it &apos;s not worry . i just ...
... i really treasure this time with you and carl ,
and i &apos;ve missed so much .
missed .
i &apos;m not gonna be around forever .
let me see .
oh , not again . choo @-@ choo .
where &apos;s this coming from ?
i guess i just hate goodbyes .
well , yeah , so do i.
so i get to be an annoying mother for another few hours .
here .
what &apos;s next ? you quit the force .
you can &apos;t work at that club forever .
you know what you want ?
actually , yeah .
for the first time in a while , i think i do .
don &apos;t worry , margaux . i &apos;ll be fine .
you shouldn &apos;t wait for your bodyguard alone .
come here .
don &apos;t worry about me so much .
i trust you were able to get what i was asking for ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
she was definitely of a mind @-@ set to sell , too .
well , of course she was .
it lost its appeal due to emily &apos;s televised assassination .
you mind me asking why getting this was so important to you ?
it &apos;s a memento ...
of a bygone era .
this is way more than we agreed to .
that &apos;s because we won &apos;t be seeing each other again ,
mr. renner .
mrs. grayson , what do you plan to do ?
something amanda clarke never had the courage to do herself ...
end this .
do you want another drink ? &apos; cause i want 12 .
party didn &apos;t go like you planned ?
why do we even still throw them ?
no , no , no , seriously . no learning curve .
i mean , i just watched tony leave with his boss ,
who was not happy , so ... that &apos;s over .
where is my barkeep ?
i have sorrows to drown . miguel !
i asked miguel to grab my last paycheck .
sorry to see you go , jack . stay in touch .
absolutely . thank you .
last paycheck ?
after all the trouble i went to setting up that daycare ,
it would have been nice to get two weeks &apos; notice , my friend .
that &apos;s actually why i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m not just quitting , nolan . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m leaving .
okay . w @-@ where are you going ?
los angeles . i &apos;m ... taking carl tonight .
and once we get set up there , i &apos;m selling the house here .
i &apos;m gonna start fresh .
wait . i ... h @-@ have you talked to emily ?
there &apos;s nothing left to say , nolan .
i told her how i felt .
she made it clear - she didn &apos;t want to be with me .
look , it &apos;s time i faced reality .
she never wanted me to be a part of this , anyway .
only because she was protecting you .
she loves you , jack .
i can &apos;t hear that right now .
and i certainly didn &apos;t hear it from her .
we both know that what emily says and what emily feels
are two very different things .
yes , we do .
but this morning at the cemetery ,
i realized something else .
emily &apos;s never gonna stop .
she can &apos;t .
this life , it &apos;s all she &apos;s known .
and , you know , maybe it ... maybe it started out
as some way to keep her father alive
when she thought she &apos;d lost him ,
but it &apos;s turned into something else ,
something that she either can &apos;t let go of ...
or doesn &apos;t want to .
don &apos;t do this , jack .
please .
look , things ... things will be different
now that she can be amanda .
i mean , my god , just give her one more chance .
no . i told her i wouldn &apos;t wait .
i &apos;m asking you as a friend ...
don &apos;t ever tell me that she loves me again .
i &apos;ll call you when i get to l.a.
i wanted to see you before i left .
how did today go ?
uh , i @-@ i didn &apos;t tell her .
i couldn &apos;t . she was so happy .
for 20 years , that was all i ever dreamed of .
how was i supposed to ruin that moment ?
you know , since being back , uh ... i always thought
that i &apos;d been given a new lease on life .
maybe i was wrong .
maybe it was all just a long setup to a sick joke .
that &apos;s a load of bull .
you didn &apos;t fight to survive that hell
just to be fate &apos;s punch line .
you &apos;re here for a reason , david .
you may not believe it now , but you will ,
which is why you need to keep fighting .
take this .
it &apos;s the number for a friend of mine
who happens to be the best oncologist you &apos;ll ever meet .
首席临床肿瘤学家
what &apos;s the other number ?
mine .
you &apos;re not doing this alone .
emily !
i &apos;ve been calling you .
why didn &apos;t you pick up ?
my phone was off .
what &apos;s wrong ?
jack &apos;s leaving .
what do you mean , &quot; leaving &quot; ?
right now . he &apos;s leaving town for good .
but ... well , he didn &apos;t say anything .
well , why would he ? he &apos;s already said everything .
i mean , did you really tell him
that you didn &apos;t want to be with him ?
i said that i can &apos;t be with him .
listen to yourself , ems .
how many times did you think you could push him away
before he finally broke ?
what was i supposed to do , nolan ?
you know how much - he &apos;s suffered because of me .
and still he chose you .
he loves you , ems .
he had the guts to open his heart .
can you ?
honestly , do you even know what you really want ?
all right , well , let me help you out ,
because sometimes it &apos;s hard to see
what &apos;s right in front of your eyes .
the only thing stopping you from choosing jack is you .
i know .
but i don &apos;t deserve him !
but you deserve me ?
ben , i &apos;m sorry .
why , because i finally heard the truth ?
look , this is so much more complica ...
will you talk to me like a person , please ?
i feel like i &apos;ve earned at least that much .
do you want this to work or not ?
well , i guess there &apos;s our answer .
ben , wait .
what ?
the truth &apos;s out , emily .
you were just hiding with me . you weren &apos;t living .
and deep down , i knew it ...
but i guess i didn &apos;t want to face reality , either .
jack &apos;s flight leaves in 20 minutes .
if you want to stop him ,
you need to make your decision right now .
you sure about this ? no regrets ?
no , no regrets .
that makes me happy , jack .
hey , carl ! carl !
wait for me .
let &apos;s go on the plane .
let &apos;s do this .
i didn &apos;t get a chance to see you at the club before i left .
well , after the destruction caused by hurricane louise ,
i ... i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d be seeing you again ever .
it &apos;s your suit , remember ?
look , i know you ... you &apos;re mad .
i mean , you have every right to be .
i hosted the worst fundraiser ever
and ruined your relationship with ...
hey , hey , hey , slow down .
look , today didn &apos;t go as planned , no question ,
and i do have some damage control to do with my boss .
but we still raised money for the kids .
that &apos;s the important thing .
huh . i assumed you &apos;d be pissed .
i was , but not at you .
louise is a lunatic , but she was a sideshow .
the main event was you ,
a man trying to do something good , not ... not destructive .
and despite her worst intentions , you succeeded .
this is not at all
how i imagined this conversation was gonna go .
usually ,
my friends start uncapping the red sharpie
right about now .
maybe it &apos;s time
you started looking at life from a different perspective .
because from this view , it looks pretty great .
i &apos;ve never met anyone like you .
now you have .
i didn &apos;t know where else to go .
i can &apos;t get ahold of victoria , and i &apos;m worried about her .
i know . me too .
i was with her earlier .
she seemed so different ... defeated .
and you left her ?
well , she was with her bodyguard .
i made her promise to call me tomorrow .
something is not right with her .
i feel so helpless .
i tried to get nolan to admit
that he and emily were behind the whole thing today , but ...
oh , they &apos;re too clever to fall for that .
but they will make a mistake ,
and we will be there to catch them .
we ?
i can get past our history ...
if you can ... for victoria .
i hope she &apos;s all right tonight .
you missed your flight .
seeing that look on your face
almost makes the past year worthwhile ,
the key word being &quot; almost . &quot;
what are you doing here , mason ?
we had a deal .
yes , we did .
and i was waiting patiently , typing away on my magnum opus ...
&quot; the secret origin of emily thorne . &quot;
so imagine my surprise
when i caught - your heartfelt performance ,
announcing to all the world that very same story ...
my story .
i had no choice . everything changed .
yes , everything but you .
which i suppose is just now starting to become apparent ,
standing there alone on the tarmac ,
realizing that while you hid behind your mission of revenge ,
everyone else around you evolved .
did you really think they &apos;d wait forever ,
sacrificing everything and getting nothing in return ?
did you honestly believe
that you &apos;d get your &quot; happily ever after &quot;
after so many lies - to so many different people ...
until all you had left were enemies ?
like the little pyromaniac that you are , you started a fire
and convinced yourself that you could contain it .
but i know your dirty little secret .
you can &apos;t exist without revenge .
the endless cycle of hate , it &apos;s your addiction .
and like all tales of compulsion ,
this will end the same way .
first you will crash ...
... and then you will burn .
