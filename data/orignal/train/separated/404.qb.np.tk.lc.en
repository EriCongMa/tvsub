mom ?
no i &apos;m ok i promise .
killed a random woman and kidnapped this kid
use the same track
not the brightest bulb .
he &apos;s been locked up for 11 years he is out of practice .
don &apos;t they say these guys come out better criminals ?
smart ones do .
you saying i &apos;m dumb ?
you &apos;re impatient angry .
you took your own kid just to get back at your ex .
you got it all figured out .
well your ex @-@ wife said ... - she was a liar .
and i should have killed her .
like you killed stacy ryan ?
why did you do it ?
you wouldn &apos;t understand .
try me .
here &apos;s what i don &apos;t get about this guy .
what &apos;s that ?
his whole life he &apos;s a thief
he comes out of prison and murderer .
he killed an innocent woman .
how do you know she &apos;s innocent ?
you stabbed her and threw her out of a truck .
what the hell did she ever do to you ?
you know what i don &apos;t get
is why you couldn &apos;t just appreciate the freedom .
you could have holed up in that cabin a long time
enjoyed the quiet .
but some people just need the distractions .
you probably got used to
all that madness when you were locked up .
it &apos;s madness for the sheep to talk peace with a wolf .
that sounds like something my daddy would say .
thomas fuller .
you impressed ?
i &apos;m surprised .
so you &apos;re the wolf .
you have no idea .
there it is .
that ego .
you know for one second
you were unpredictable .
but you can &apos;t help yourself . you gotta talk a big talk .
but just so you know that &apos;s boring .
hey what was that ?
sit up .
oh i &apos;m gonna be sick .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m gonna pull over .
oh i &apos;m gonna be sick .
can you turn the light on ?
i &apos;m gonna be sick .
oh what the hell ?
ohh ! am i still boring ?
what ?
am i boring ? !
where are the keys ? uhh !
oh wait ! i &apos;m a federal agent !
i have a prisoner in here who &apos;s just killed this officer !
i knew it . you are one committed son of a bitch .
oh my arm.- no no that &apos;s the prisoner !
what are you doing ?
uhh ! give me the gun .
what ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
you killed a cop ?
give me the gun .
she &apos;s a fed .
look she knows there &apos;s two of us now .
you &apos;re gonna need stitches .
i &apos;m not going to the hospital .
there &apos;s a lot of blood . put pressure on it .
give me the gun .
you &apos;re gonna be all right .
come on give me the damn gun !
get in the truck ! come on !
come on !
&quot; men are more ready to repay an injury than a benefit
because gratitude is a burden and revenge a pleasure . &quot;
tacitus .
pull over . that &apos;s one of us . pull over .
prentiss !
ohh . what the hell happened ? are you all right ?
bunting &apos;s down there . he &apos;s dead .
where &apos;s schrader ?
he &apos;s gone .
it was a ... a big ...
truck new york tags
uh victor alpha 737 .
they went northbound about 10 minutes ago .
son of a bitch got away .
he &apos;s got a partner .
first case back we won
and you &apos;ll be home for breakfast .
we never figured out
why schrader killed stacy ryan .
she had no connection to his daughter or his ex @-@ wife .
there &apos;s been an accident .
emily &apos;s in the hospital bunting &apos;s dead .
is she all right ?
she has a concussion .
is morgan with her ?
yeah .
where &apos;s schrader ?
northbound in a truck .
a truck ?
he has a partner .
what ?
we need roadblocks now .
do we have a tag ?
uh emily murmured a partial .
better than nothing .
he could be headed to canada .
we need somebody who knows the area .
i &apos;ll get an officer .
and jj ...
yeah you want schrader &apos;s face everywhere .
schrader was a bank robber .
now he &apos;s murdered a woman
kidnapped his daughter and killed a cop .
he &apos;s obviously more sophisticated
than we originally thought .
he &apos;s got a bigger plan . it &apos;s not just about
getting his daughter and fleeing the country .
we never profiled that he &apos;d have a partner .
we don &apos;t know this guy at all .
got to admit you &apos;re better than i thought .
those idiots don &apos;t know what hit them .
sit still .
at least give me some aspirin .
oh ! come on . really ?
oh man . are you done yet ?
we gotta go .
i don &apos;t have the key .
what ?
my contact wasn &apos;t there .
her shift starts at 8 : 00 .
tomorrow ? so we &apos;re just gonna wait ?
you know this wouldn &apos;t be such a big deal if you hadn &apos;t killed a cop .
oh he didn &apos;t know when to shut up .
you know what &apos;s gonna happen now ?
they &apos;re gonna put your picture everywhere .
they &apos;re gonna triple patrol .
you just screwed your chances of ever getting out of here .
well see that &apos;s where you come in .
i got faith in you .
is this gonna leave a scar ?
no we gotta find schrader .
the team &apos;s got it covered .
don &apos;t make me stay here .
i &apos;m fine honestly . pull this thing over .
prentiss you can &apos;t even focus .
you have a concussion .
i saw the guy .
white 40s i know .
ok so give me a cognitive interview .
your adrenaline &apos;s pumping .
exactly .
emily you &apos;re in shock .
it just happened . it &apos;ll never be clearer .
how many shots did you fire ?
3 .
you emptied your clip .
no ...
i did ?
all right so schrader pulled a series of bank heists
in the 1990s .
he was the only one to ever go away for the crimes .
he was a model prisoner only served 11 of his 15 years
was released early on good behavior
and any friends he had are either dead or still in prison .
a 3 @-@ ton truck was found north of the accident
not too far from canada .
we have the heaviest presence at border crossings .
he probably knows that .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna sit still for long .
he might have to depending on how injured he is .
what do we know ?
dale schrader went to prison for robbery .
he was hands off . all of his crimes were impersonal .
2 days after he &apos;s released he kills stacy ryan
and he kidnaps his daughter .
it &apos;s both personal and emotional .
when he &apos;s not attached to the crime he pulls it off
but the minute he &apos;s invested like with his daughter
he lets his guard down and gets caught. it makes sense .
so he &apos;s not the hard @-@ ass we thought he was .
but if jenny were what he wanted
he had her . he could have left .
yeah we thought he took her and ran to canada right ?
that theory made sense. why didn &apos;t he ?
pictures from the accident .
any word on emily ?
apparently she &apos;s arguing with the doctors .
that &apos;s good .
let &apos;s took a look to pull off .
what if he &apos;s got a group of guys to call on ?
i agree . all those bank jobs were a solo
but this is a lot for one man to orchestrate .
figured out why he killed stacy ryan ?
we haven &apos;t found any connection to schrader
but he may be connected to the partner .
how ?
killing her might have been advance payment
for breaking him out of custody .
garcia
i need everything you &apos;ve got on stacy ryan .
what do you mean he got away ?
somebody broke him out of custody .
oh god .
we &apos;re gonna keep the two of you here .
there &apos;s gonna be an officer standing watch the entire time .
if you can &apos;t find him how long will you keep us safe ?
ma &apos;am we will find him .
you don &apos;t know dale . when he wants something he gets it .
can you think of anyone at all who might want to help him ?
he doesn &apos;t trust anybody .
it &apos;s not necessarily about trust .
maybe somebody who &apos;s indebted to him
and he was trying to collect on it ?
i don &apos;t know .
jenny ...
you and your dad were alone the entire time ?
nobody was in the truck or the cabin ?
nobody .
who would do this for dale ?
who would risk everything to help him ?
that &apos;s what we need to find out .
stacy ryan had two times in her life--
when she was high and when she was waiting to get high .
the only thread i have between them
is that her brother spent time with schrader
upstate like ... 5 years ago .
why would schrader kill a junkie ?
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
where &apos;s the brother now ?
dead .
it doesn &apos;t feel like schrader does anything randomly .
stacy must have meant something to him .
yeah but ... what ?
never mind i see her .
i can take her from here. thanks .
thank you .
i can walk .
sit .
i like pushing you around .
does it hurt ?
if by &quot; it &quot; you mean my entire body then yes .
did jenny see anything ?
she never saw the partner .
oh what the hell ?
they found a truck ditched a few miles from the accident .
plates were missing
but the front end definitely a stole a truck
ok so the partner saw everything in the woods
he ran away and stole a truck ?
who is this guy ?
he knew you were taking that road back to the station .
he waited for you and he crashed into you .
this whole thing feels meticulous .
ok so he needs the partner for something else .
for what though ?
well i don &apos;t know . i mean he was locked up all this time .
he planned the whole day .
he should have had backup plans for his backup plans .
his ex shouldn &apos;t have been home for a few hours
so he clearly had enough time
to get across the border with jenny until we showed up .
but he stayed local holed up in that cabin .
he had what he wanted . he could have just run .
there &apos;s gotta be something else keeping him in lockport .
i couldn &apos;t stop him from choking bunting .
emily don &apos;t do that .
he was right there .
schrader &apos;s face is all over the news .
he &apos;s been on the run for almost 2 hours
and we &apos;re no closer to catching him .
we need to find the partner .
hey. how are you ?
i feel like i got hit by a truck .
here sit .
thanks .
uh garcia tell everyone what you just told me .
i have unearthed more of schrader &apos;s past .
now what we do know is that he robbed 15 banks
in the state of new york in the nineties .
however what your resident glamour @-@ puss smarty @-@ pants just find out
was that most of that money was never recovered .
where is it ?
my best guess-- only he knows .
good reason to stick around lockport .
the last robbery the one that put him away
should have been routine right ? so what happened ?
maybe someone turned him in .
he kept to himself always worked alone .
who &apos;d turn him in ?
we &apos;re missing somebody .
garcia .
yes checking sir .
what &apos;s this all about ?
nothing to do till morning .
what &apos;s your problem ?
hesitation puts obstacles in the path .
boldness eliminates them .
boldness strikes fear .
fear creates authority .
&quot; the 48 laws of power . &quot; you know it ?
you want to shoot me ?
have i said thanks yet ?
ok . records leading up to schrader &apos;s arrest
show this other bank robber
named dan otey .
and he was looking at copious amounts of time then he strikes a deal
and all of a sudden schrader is arrested .
it can &apos;t be a coincidence .
you know it &apos;s not uncommon for criminals to buy jobs off one another .
maybe that &apos;s what schrader did
but dan otey sold him out for a lesser sentence .
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
otey was a rat and now he &apos;s the partner ?
yeah you &apos;re right .
schrader wouldn &apos;t trust him .
if anything he &apos;d want him dead .
probably but he &apos;d use him first .
he &apos;d tell otey that he owes him one
and that he might save his life if he helps him get out of this jam .
where &apos;s he now garcia ?
uh dan otey is a local .
he lives off of route 7 .
nobody &apos;s here . let &apos;s go .
is your daddy home ?
who are you ?
close the door !
don &apos;t do this .
calm down . i &apos;m just gonna scare him a little bit .
hey dan !
you sent your son to the door ?
coward !
his wife and son were home .
are they ok ?
the partner took them upstairs
while schrader destroyed the place .
emily is with the wife right now .
dan had turned everything around .
he was clean life was finally good .
but i was always afraid to believe it you know ?
because then he could be taken away .
i &apos;m so sorry .
the other man-- what did he look like ?
uh white ...
mid @-@ 40s ...
short hair ...
i don &apos;t know .
had you ever seen him before ?
dale yeah . the other guy no .
we &apos;re trying to figure out how schrader knows his partner .
i have no idea .
how did they talk to each other ?
they didn &apos;t .
dale trashed the place
and the other guy took us upstairs .
he kept pushing me and ... jason .
i didn &apos;t know what was gonna happen .
did he hurt you ?
he just scared us . he locked us in the back room .
he locked you in the room and that &apos;s it ?
yeah .
he told us to shut up and keep it locked .
but jason wouldn &apos;t stop crying .
this wasn &apos;t the deal .
really ?
i didn &apos;t sign up to kill anybody .
you saved my ass .
you pulled me out of that car remember ?
then people died .
i can &apos;t do it . i won &apos;t .
yes you will .
you terrorized that family . you killed their father .
don &apos;t worry . the kid is young .
he won &apos;t remember him .
i also killed that cop . don &apos;t forget about him .
you enjoyed it .
yes i did . and you didn &apos;t stop me .
ooh ... i get it .
ohh ... you gotta do what you gotta do .
and i want what i want .
come on bro .
almost done .
schrader gets off on power .
that and money are what motivate him .
and revenge .
11 years away he comes out a murderer .
who needs a partner somebody as bold as him .
and where &apos;d they meet ?
schrader was away and patient .
the minute he got out he hooked up with his partner first
and then he killed stacy ryan
on his way to kidnap his daughter .
what &apos;s missing from his day ?
the money .
he took his daughter but left the money .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
did he have another plan on how to support himself in canada ?
he &apos;s only known a life of crime .
he &apos;s incapable of change .
time away proved that .
well otey &apos;s wife said that the partner locked them away
like he didn &apos;t want them to get hurt .
he was protective . that &apos;s weird right ?
they &apos;re both dominant personalities
but they sound like they played good cop / bad cop .
well it &apos;s been 4 hours since the accident .
you still think i &apos;m in shock ?
there &apos;s one way to find out .
ok . first thing
we go to the station gonna get the key .
then we go to the bank which opens at 9 : 00 .
then we &apos;re done .
it &apos;s not that easy . i told you .
not for me .
but you-- everybody loves you .
ok i do this . then what ?
then it &apos;s over .
no .
no ?
no . there &apos;s no version of me surviving this .
you get what you want i &apos;m dead .
well if you believe that do it .
go ahead . you can stop this right now .
you want me dead . how bad ?
come on . kill me .
what ?
you need my help ? is that what you need ?
you know i &apos;m not gonna stop this
until i get what i want .
i &apos;m not gonna stop it but you can .
you want to end it ? then do it . end it .
come on . do it .
take a chance that this all works out for you . come on !
come on ! do it !
come on ! come on !
end it ! do it ! come on ! do it !
that &apos;s what i thought .
it &apos;s not in you joey . never was .
all right take a deep breath prentiss .
let &apos;s just do this .
all right .
tell me what you saw . was it dark ?
yeah . you were there . you know it was .
come on now .
ok .
what did it smell like inside the car ?
sweat .
so you were hot ?
yeah . i--i opened the window a little bit .
it &apos;s really quiet .
are there any other cars on the road ?
there &apos;s one coming .
what color is it ?
i ... it &apos;s too bright .
ok but you looked at it . you saw it .
it &apos;s a 4 @-@ door hybrid black .
where was schrader ?
he &apos;s looking out the window .
was he waiting for something ?
here comes another car .
a car or the truck ?
it &apos;s the truck .
schrader sees it .
that &apos;s when it happens . he &apos;s ... out of his seatbelt .
he &apos;s hunched over .
and he gets his cuffs out in front of him .
ok then what ?
uh bunting pulled over
and--and schrader put his seatbelt back on .
he knew it was coming .
where did the truck come from ?
uh behind us . uh no--
uh ... it was in front of us .
who was driving prentiss ?
i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t see .
ok . it &apos;s all right it &apos;s all right .
you &apos;re sure it was the truck ?
yeah . it &apos;s a big truck .
think . who was driving ?
who was driving ?
a white male 40s .
all right now your car stops rolling .
yeah . um ...
i &apos;m pinned . my seatbelt is jammed .
i can &apos;t breathe . i can &apos;t see anything . i can hear--
oh god he &apos;s killing bunting .
but the partner &apos;s not there yet ?
no .
where is he ?
he &apos;s running towards us .
what &apos;s he wearing ?
jeans . boots .
what &apos;s wrong with you ? you killed a cop ?
he &apos;s freaked out that bunting &apos;s dead .
why would he care ?
i don &apos;t know . but he won &apos;t let him kill me .
give me the gun .
she &apos;s a fed .
she knows that there &apos;s two of us now .
and he keeps telling him to ...
put pressure on it .
on the bleeding .
ok . it &apos;s gonna be ok .
wait . he was talking to me .
there &apos;s a lot of blood . put pressure on it .
you &apos;re gonna be all right . understand ?
he knew we were on that road .
he was upset that bunting was dead .
he wouldn &apos;t let schrader kill me .
he kept telling me to put pressure on it .
and he was calm like he &apos;s done this before .
he was helping me .
he took dan otey &apos;s family upstairs
protected them from schrader .
do we really think a good guy hooked up
with a criminal like dale schrader ?
you have one saved message .
3 : 37 am
joe honey it &apos;s me .
they got us . all of us .
i don &apos;t know where we are .
god i am so sorry .
help us daddy !
just do what he says ok ?
please just do whatever he says .
joe help us .
joe honey it &apos;s me .
he got us .
you &apos;ve almost got it .
you &apos;re doing so good .
i &apos;m sorry . please .
oh my god .
my god please stop !
don &apos;t you touch him !
it &apos;s not his fault . i told him to do it .
no wait ! what are you doing ?
mom ! mommy !
no ! don &apos;t take my kid !
mom ! mommy ! mom help !
stop !
mom !
no ...
mom !
so how did schrader get this guy to sign on ?
6 : 30 am
good people do bad things .
i &apos;m just saying it happens .
right . but this partner wouldn &apos;t let me die .
he protected otey &apos;s family .
in the same day he helped a convicted felon escape custody .
his loyalties are all over the place .
the guy sounds desperate .
maybe he needs some money .
i mean schrader &apos;s got a lot of it still out there .
he could have promised him a cut .
ah i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s an accomplice
to 3 murders and a kidnapping .
is there enough money out there
for you to sign on to something like that ?
so it &apos;s something bigger than the money .
um maybe schrader &apos;s threatening him .
leverage ?
it would have to be big .
we caught schrader because he kidnapped his daughter .
he was emotional and his guard was down .
clearly family means more to him than we thought .
schrader &apos;s ex @-@ wife forced him to give up custody of jenny .
maybe he wants this guy to know what it feels like
to lose his family too .
it sounds like revenge to me .
maybe it is .
you know what i just don &apos;t get ?
why people think you &apos;re a hero .
i know something they don &apos;t .
you want to be just like me .
honest men bore you .
they &apos;re too predictable .
and you &apos;d rather die than be ordinary
so you take risks and you push the limits .
but you were raised to be a good guy .
it &apos;s in your blood . you can &apos;t help it .
but that kills you a little bit .
that &apos;s why you had to figure out a way
for a good guy to be bad
and that &apos;s how you got into my world .
am i close ?
i want to talk to them .
you got your message and that picture .
how do i know you haven &apos;t killed them already ?
you have to trust me .
well i &apos;m disappointed .
but your wife and your kids are gonna be devastated .
&apos;cause they didn &apos;t have to die .
look you &apos;re gonna kill me . there &apos;s no point in hurting them .
what kind of father are you ?
we &apos;ve been over this .
i &apos;m the only one who knows where they are .
as long as i &apos;m alive they &apos;re safe .
if you stop helping me they &apos;re dead . how &apos;s that ?
8 : 17 am
anything on schrader &apos;s case ?
the usual suspects-- judge lawyers .
they &apos;re all accounted for this morning .
if it &apos;s revenge then it &apos;s gotta be someone who put him away .
well it &apos;s not the officers who arrested him
or the judge who sentenced him .
then who is it ?
garcia i need the names of every law enforcement agent
involved in the schrader case .
you know everybody .
yeah but i want every single employee the year that he was arrested .
ok give me a minute .
a whole minute ? come on baby girl what
are you losing your touch ?
oh watch your pretty mouth .
personnel records come at you now .
who &apos;s still active ?
most .
would he risk using an active officer ?
depends on how much he hates them .
has anyone retired ?
yeah two of them . let &apos;s see--matt massey jeff messick .
both married with kids white in their 50s .
wait can i see those pictures ?
no .
no .
ohh . why wouldn &apos;t he go after one of the officers
who arrested him ?
it makes the most sense for revenge .
hey wait a minute guys . listen to this .
there was a witness who never testified on schrader &apos;s behalf .
schrader could see that as a betrayal .
he gets out of prison and uses him to get what he wants .
garcia i want you to run a history on a witness from the schrader case
joey short .
joey short .
was born in &apos; 66 in n.y.c.
didn &apos;t hold a lot of jobs except for construction .
in and out of rehab .
where is he now ?
his last known address was 10 years ago .
did he do time ?
mm @-@ mmm . no .
come on garcia . people don &apos;t just disappear .
this guy &apos;s got a history with a lot of holes in it .
he went to rehab .
you know maybe this guy had to walk the walk .
he was undercover .
that makes sense .
those guys are up for anything
and they take big risks professionally and personally .
it explains his behavior too . good guy doing bad things .
garcia can you get us joey short &apos;s real name ?
it &apos;s not here .
well if schrader can find it so can we .
the guy needed to be schrader &apos;s friend
so they &apos;re probably around the same age .
look for academy graduates in the early nineties .
ok .
did any of them not go into police work ?
baby i don &apos;t follow you .
if he went undercover then anything tied to the academy
would have to be severed . i mean the guy graduated
but he had to immediately start working his history as joey short .
he went into construction
made his contacts in the bank robbery world
and then he met schrader
earned schrader &apos;s trust
and then turned him in and got out of the game .
ok . here &apos;s a couple of guys look like they dropped out .
you got any pictures ?
sending them your way now .
that is the guy .
that picture is 10 years old but that &apos;s him .
that is joe muller .
he has a wife and 2 kids .
that &apos;s definitely the guy . where is he now ?
betts .
yes ?
joe muller .
let me look at you .
how &apos;s life ?
it &apos;s a ride .
molly the kids ?
good . they &apos;re good .
what are you doing here ?
just uh you know working on an old case .
uh they stopped paying you didn &apos;t they ?
yes ma &apos;am .
don &apos;t you ma &apos;am me . what do you need ?
just uh 5 minutes ?
you got it .
you &apos;re the best .
ok thanks .
muller &apos;s not at home . no one is .
his wife didn &apos;t show up at work
the kids weren &apos;t at school yesterday or today .
schrader probably has them hostage .
yeah but where ?
what could joe muller do for him ?
the only thing that &apos;s left . he can get him the money .
well no one even knows where it is .
schrader knows .
where do these guys hide money ?
someplace safe .
would he be bold enough to hide it a safe deposit box ?
a thief using a bank ? yeah maybe .
schrader can &apos;t walk into a bank .
his face is everywhere .
no one would think twice if muller walked in .
he &apos;d have to have a key .
where &apos;s the physical evidence from the schrader case ?
we don &apos;t have it .
well if we can figure out where schrader hid the money
we &apos;ll know where he &apos;s going .
hi .
thank you .

the only person who knew where my family was

please just do whatever he says .
i &apos;m gonna get garcia to trace this .
unknown name unknown number .
she might be able to help .
there was only one phone call ?
i tried to get him to let me talk to them again
but he wouldn &apos;t .
there must not be anyone there watching them .
so he hid a family
where no one hears them call for help .
someplace remote . that cabin ?
no . the locals tore it apart .
there &apos;s no one there .
where are they ?
you saw schrader since he &apos;s had your family .
you saw something or heard it .
there &apos;s got to be some clue .
when was the last time you saw your family ?
hold on joe i &apos;ve got to get my phone .
oh uh it &apos;s right here .
cold drains the battery .
i know . sorry .
ok .
see you later mrs. muller .
if you &apos;re lucky .
you notice any cars on the street ?
nothing .
let me get your seatbelt in .
our routine &apos;s the same every day .
the kids have to be at school by 8 : 15 then molly heads to work .
she didn &apos;t make it to either yesterday . what was her route ?
uh north on route 7 east on 22 .
is that route isolated during the morning commute ?
no .
if he was watching
there &apos;s a good chance she never left the driveway .
i drove out first .
drive .
i just left them there .
where did he find you ?
at the hardware store .
i know who you are .
he told me how for 11 years
he &apos;d been trying to figure out how he got locked up .
he knew otey had ratted him out for the robbery
but that wasn &apos;t enough to put him away .
he said i was the piece that didn &apos;t fit .
he figured out i was a cop .
and he took your family .
did you ever see this woman ?
yeah . i think she &apos;s some junkie .
i saw her right after he told me ...
you help me your family lives .
you don &apos;t they die .
pull over right up here .
right here .
stacy . i don &apos;t have time for this .
i told you there &apos;ll be more when it &apos;s over .
i got some people helping and they don &apos;t want to wait .
that &apos;s not my problem .
my brother said you were a son of a bitch .
you know what he &apos;s doing ?
huh ? you know what &apos;s in here ?
what &apos;s going on !
open the door . - who is she ?
go .
come on . drive .
go !
you didn &apos;t know what she was talking about ?
no .
pull over .
what are you gonna do with her ?
he could have left the body in the alley .
why didn &apos;t he ?
he didn &apos;t want to draw attention to that place .
where was it ?
uh south of van wyck .
bad area ?
abandoned . junkies took over .
perfect place to leave hostages .
can you take us back there ?
wait . you think she knew about my family .
her murder was the only thing that didn &apos;t fit
and now it makes sense . schrader killed her to shut her up .

washington irving said
there is a sacredness in tears .
they are not the mark of weakness but of power .
they are messengers of overwhelming grief
and of unspeakable love .
you got a sec ?
come in .
i just wanted to say
that you exceeded all expectations leading this team .
mine and everyone else &apos;s .
so have you hotch .
you showed the skill and confidence of a natural leader
and ... i thank you for it .
of course .
i get why you &apos;re back .
do you ?
you were never going to sit behind a desk . you know why ?
because your son knows that you get the bad guys .
and if you &apos;re not out there trying to catch them
what &apos;s he going to think ?
well tonight he &apos;s gonna think i wasn &apos;t there at bedtime .
you &apos;re his hero hotch .
i uh figured i &apos;d save you a couple hours .
you don &apos;t have to do that anymore .
i know i don &apos;t .
but i also know what it &apos;s like to be raised by a single parent .
every minute counts .
so if you need me to make that a regular thing
i &apos;d be more than happy to .
i appreciate that .
i really do .
good night .
