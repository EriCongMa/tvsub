look at me .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
why is he doing this ?
is that enough ?
we did what you wanted . let us go .
no .
now it &apos;s my turn .
no !
hey good news .
ellie just got placed with a foster family
so fingers crossed .
oh that &apos;s great . i &apos;m happy for her .
we got a case in akron ohio .
two couples killed in two weeks .
one a week ?
that &apos;s not much of a cooling @-@ off period .
scott and kathy hartway .
found in their car in an isolated spot .
the son of sam had a short cooling @-@ off period .
he also attacked couples in cars .
yeah but the first couple were killed in their house .
robert and allison keppler .
in both cases the husbands were killed
with a silenced 9 @-@ millimeter
the wife was stabbed multiple times .
he crosses racial lines .
and socio @-@ economic ones .
the kepplers lived in an upscale neighborhood
the hartways were blue collar .
that &apos;s a big change in crime scenes car versus house .
two radically different m.o.s
not to mention he subdues two people .
that takes a lot of skill .
there &apos;s no indication of how he overwhelms them .
there &apos;s no antemortem bruising . he doesn &apos;t use a blitz attack .
well he &apos;s got a 9 @-@ millimeter .
he doesn &apos;t need to .
how about signs of forced entry to the car or the house ?
no . but akron p.d. did find this .
handcuffs . so he restrains the men
and saves the real savaging for the wife .
is this right ?
they found a used condom on both the husbands ?
and both had viagra in their systems
and neither had a prescription .
so the unsub gives the men viagra
and then forces them to have sex before he kills them .
and given the timetable he &apos;s gonna strike again soon .
we fly to akron tonight . wheels up in 3 hours .
garcia . what &apos;s that ?
my go bags .
where are you going ?
with you hopefully .
sir i think we &apos;re all still reeling since jj left
and we are a man down
and you need a communications liaison .
garcia--
sir please hear me out .
my job overlapped with jj &apos;s the most .
i created that program that she used to present cases .
when you guys were out in the field
she coordinated your needs through me . it makes sense .
garcia there are aspects of the job for which you have no training .
you &apos;re totally right but i--i &apos;m willing to learn .
i &apos;ll learn how to interact with families
and local law enforcement and the media .
sir i &apos;m willing to tone down my wardrobe choices .
i &apos;m ready to make that sacrifice
if you just please give me a chance .
all right . we could explore this on a trial basis .
we &apos;ll see how things go .
are you up to speed on the case ?
yes .
can you be ready in 3 hours ?
i &apos;m ready now .
see you on the plane .
ok .
abraham lincoln said
&quot; whatever you are be a good one . &quot;
i &apos;m just waiting on a few last @-@ minute details .
let &apos;go ahead and get started .
i keep bumping on the fact
that he makes a married couple have sex before he kills them .
what is he accomplishing with that ?
you know the stabbing of the wives
is almost certainly piqueristic .
the unsub gets sexual gratification
from penetration with a knife .
most piquerists are impotent--
men like albert fish iain scoular andrei chikatilo
so for him it could be a substitute for sex .
the unsub could also be playing a mind game .
neither shot to the husband is clean
so they have to watch what he &apos;s doing to their wives
as they &apos;re dying .
so this guy challenges their manhood
by forcing them to have sex
and then mocks them with the overkill .
that kind of psychological torture
makes him a sexual sadist .
it would explain the amount of control
he exhibits over the crime scene--
the handcuffs the condoms the silenced weapon .
he plans out every detail .
if he &apos;s that precise
he would be just as precise in his victimology .
but he &apos;s all over the map
in terms of class and race .
well there must be something else
about the couples that attracts him .
something that he couldn &apos;t learn
by stalking them anonymously .
maybe the couples met the unsub before .
rossi and reid will you handle the family interviews ?
morgan and prentiss go to the latest crime scene .
we need to learn as much as we can about him
so let &apos;s really pin down the m.o.
well look at you look at you .
meet your new communications liaison .
trial communications liaison .
garcia i don &apos;t get to say this often
but i had no idea there was this side of you .
well i figure since i &apos;m going to have to
interact with the mass populace
i should dress in the traditional costume of a mere mortal .
what &apos;s wrong ?
oh it &apos;s my contact .
it keeps getting weird and ... huh .
there it goes .
no .
yes . no .
detective crowley ?
hi . miss garcia .
yeah .
thanks for coming .
and she emailed pictures of you guys .
agents hotchner rossi
and dr. reid right ?
it &apos;s doctor not agent .
she was specific about that .
what else was she specific about ?
everything your team needed .
i sent her a list of family members
who &apos;d be willing to talk
and your boards are over there
all ready for you to set them up .
i even got the push pins you asked for .
excuse me .
are you miss garcia ?
mr. keppler . hi .
hi .
this is detective crowley .
he &apos;ll show you to the interview room .
hello sir .
right this way .
he is such a sweet man .
you contacted the family members already ?
yes . only two responded back immediately .
that &apos;s robert keppler &apos;s dad
and then scott hartway &apos;s mom will be here in about an hour .
is that enough time ?
yes . perfect .
ok . i &apos;m gonna set up the boards
unless you need something else .
no we &apos;re good . thank you .
great .
and you were worried .
ok thank you .
so he has a gun
he gains the upper hand immediately .
he keeps it trained on the wife
so the husband has no choice but to surrender .
where does he confront them ?
not the parking lot . too many variables
for someone this controlled .
he could have been lying in wait in the backseat though .
no .
i mean if they were facing forward
the unsub &apos;s back here down low
he pops up with his gun
there &apos;s no chance for them to fight back .
he could have used a slim jim to get in .
that wouldn &apos;t leave any marks .
yeah but here &apos;s the real trick .
how did he force two people
to have sex at gunpoint ?
with viagra apparently .
viagra &apos;s a vasodilator .
it takes at least 30 minutes
to get the blood vessels to relax properly .
i mean scott &apos;s fight or flight response would have kicked in .
his heart &apos;s racing his blood &apos;s flowing to all his extremities
but not the right one .
maybe he got them to relax .
he tells them he &apos;ll
let them live if they do this .
this guy has to control everything .
that would include the environment right ?
oh he turned the heat all the way up .
he didn &apos;t want them getting cold ?
radio announcer : 105.5
this station wasn &apos;t one of the presets .
that means he tuned it for them .
it &apos;s almost like he went out of his way
to make sure they were comfortable .
a sexual sadist wouldn &apos;t do that .
we need to take a look at the first crime scene .
can you walk us
through a typical day in your son &apos;s life ?
what do you mean ?
the man we &apos;re looking for
may very well have met robert and allison .
can you tell us what they liked to do ?
i can tell you those two were married .
to their jobs .
he was lawyer and she was a pediatrician .
they went to work
they came home .
that was their day .
so he was driven .
scott was at the post office by 7 : 00 every morning .
he had his eye on that branch manager office .
he wanted to run the whole zip code .
so did he have enemies at work ?
robert stepped on toes to close a deal i suppose
but he was shooting for v.p. by the end of the year .
he--he &apos;d have made it too .
was he that way his entire life ?
class president 4 years in a row .
so many all @-@ americans ...
he ran out of room on his varsity jacket .
what about college ?
well top of his class at harvard .
made &quot; law review &quot; at yale .
i was very proud .
so both victims were alpha males ?
it &apos;s the only trait we could find that connects the couples .
we know that female type isn &apos;t specific to this unsub
but what if this is ?
typically alpha males only attack other alphas .
that &apos;s how the unsub sees himself .
these men are the only competitors he takes seriously .
and the overkill on the wives is expression
of control in alpha male terms .
he &apos;s proving his dominance over his rival
by obliterating their mate .
we need more details about these men &apos;s lives .
i &apos;ll have garcia pull up more personal information .
detective have you seen ms. garcia ?
she &apos;s outside talking to a reporter .
guy from the local paper wanted a quote from the fbi .
excuse me .
no comment .
off the record then .
is the fbi assisting the akron police
in the couple killer case ?
ok first of all no comment means no comment .
second of all that name of the killer--
you came up with that name . we didn &apos;t come up with that name .
well forget the name . the name &apos;s gone .
just uh give me some background
and we &apos;ll hold the story until you give me the green light .
you &apos;ll hold the story ?
absolutely .
have you cleared that with your editor ?
uh ... of course .
can you get him on the phone ?
and the hold also applies to
your blog that the paper hosts ?
right . that .
you sneaky son of a--
you &apos;ll have your story when the akron police make an arrest .
until then the fbi has no comment
as ms. garcia stated . thank you .
he lied . he lied to me .
no he just counted on you not asking the right questions .
why didn &apos;t you check with me before you talked to him ?
i looked everywhere and i couldn &apos;t find you .
and i figured it was one of those things
that you would just count on me to handle .
garcia i appreciate the initiative
but when it comes to dealing with the press
let me handle things for now .
yes sir . absolutely .
i need all the credit card and phone records
for all the husbands .
we think the unsub is targeting them first .
ok .
thank you .
hotch there &apos;s something you need to see .
this is the second crime scene .
the unsub took the hartways to lovers lane .
then he turned the heat up in the vehicle
and tuned the radio to a soul music station .
this is the first crime scene .
al green was in the cd player
candles had been lit .
he &apos;s staging the scene .
control is critical to him .
we know this .
but to a different end than we initially thought .
these murders are about the fantasy
only the fantasy isn &apos;t sadistic it &apos;s romantic .
well we profiled from the interviews
that he &apos;s picking the husbands first . how &apos;s that romantic ?
alpha males marry the most attractive females .
once he meets the husband
he knows the wife is gonna fit his needs .
we know this unsub is impotent
but what we &apos;re seeing here isn &apos;t the usual psychological block
keeping him from getting aroused . this is physiological .
how can you be sure of that ?
he brings viagra to the crime scenes .
if he wanted he could pop a pill
let the drug take effect .
instead he gives it to the husbands . why ?
it &apos;s not working for him anymore .
something definitely happened to this guy .
prostate cancer surgery something .
but whatever it was
it cut him off from fulfilling his needs
so he &apos;s using the couples as surrogates .
so why does he make the husband wear a condom ?
well we don &apos;t know that connection yet .
he &apos;s going to kill the husbands anyway .
he can &apos;t perform on the wives .
the condoms are redundant .
if the theory &apos;s right
he &apos;s acting out a fantasy
in which contraception plays a key role .
until we understand what the role is
we &apos;re not gonna find him .
quick !
get the--
baby get the--
ohh ! no !
no ! no ...
no ... no ...
wait .
i &apos;ll do what you want .
just don &apos;t hurt me
please ...
tell me you want me .
i want you .
say it ...
like you mean it .
i want you .
do you want me ?
you do .
you want me .
you want me .
you want me .
you want me . say you want me .
you want me .
i just heard .
the unsub shot both victims last night ?
the housekeeper found them this morning .
his routine was disrupted . that means he made a mistake .
it also means he &apos;s out of control .
he &apos;s enraged . he &apos;s going to attack again soon .
paul wilson spinal surgeon .
alpha male just like the others .
can you just hold on for a moment ?
the offensive and defensive wounds all over his body .
he was cuffed behind his back .
he still put up a hell of a fight .
because he knew how . look . the wounds extend
from his knees to the soles of his feet .
that &apos;s full @-@ contact training .
now where would learn something like that ?
my assumption would be a mixed martial arts gym .
mma has skyrocketed among the men who want
the most intense fighting possible .
which our unsub would .
it could be where he &apos;s finding his victims .
i &apos;ll follow up with the families .
maybe she went for the gun in the drawer
forced the unsub to shoot her
and stopped him from following his ritual .
no &apos; cause there was a muzzle burn on her chest .
he shot her at pointblank range .
ok you &apos;re the unsub
i &apos;m debra wilson .
i have to get past you to get to that gun .
but she takes her robe off .
now your 9 @-@ millimeter
is right here at my chest .
what am i doing ?
she offered herself to him ?
well why would she do that ?
why not lock herself in the bathroom or run out the door ?
well survival isn &apos;t logical it &apos;s instinctual .
her instincts probably told her that this was her best shot .
ok . she &apos;s telling herself she &apos;s gonna do whatever is necessary
to get out of this alive .
so she &apos;s just seen her husband die in front of her .
then she comes on to the unsub ?
an overt sexual expression .
yeah it &apos;s almost flexible . she &apos;s gone from one man
to the next without hesitation .
he makes the husband wear a condom .
what does that say about him ?
that he &apos;s protecting himself ?
it &apos;s a sexual scenario
where you &apos;re sharing a woman with another man .
am i crazy
or could this guy be a swinger ?
he could have been a part
of that scene until the impotence kicked in .
and now he &apos;s just trying to recreate it .
these couples could have been his old partners .
ok so here &apos;s what i found out .
only paul wilson trained at an mma gym
but all the other husbands worked out regularly
from the local ymca to expensive fitness clubs .
makes sense . alpha males care about their appearance .
the gym is also a good place to stalk victims .
it still doesn &apos;t tell us
how he goes from finding husbands in a gym
to getting inside their house .
no but it does give us a list from which we can eliminate .
yeah but we &apos;ve got a bigger problem here .
the unsub &apos;s fantasy was interrupted .
at the least he &apos;s hunting again tonight .
at the worst he &apos;ll escalate his violence .
will you ask crowley to gather his officers .
we can give the profile .
garcia .
yes sir .
we &apos;ve got a possible lead in the husbands &apos; gyms and health clubs .
i need a list of everyone in and out .
ok so employees and members .
no wider than that . outside vendors
maintenance trainers everybody .
that &apos;s a lot . and i &apos;m not done cataloguing
husbands &apos; records like you asked me to
&apos;cause i keep getting delayed .
delayed how ?
uh family members calling back cops with questions .
also i &apos;m helping morgan call swing clubs
&apos;cause we thought some of the victims might be swingers .
they &apos;re not . by the way there &apos;s more swing clubs in akron
than there really should be .
garcia i need you to prioritize this .
we need to get ahead of this guy .
he may strike again tonight .
sir may i please bring kevin lynch in ?
it could help me get it done like bang .
that &apos;s fine and if for any reason you get stuck just let me know .
and tell morgan and prentiss
that we &apos;re releasing the profile .
have them give it to everybody that they &apos;ve met
in the swingers community
yes yes i can do that .
uh jehovah &apos;s witnesses ?
oh no ma &apos;am . um ...
i &apos;m special agent prentiss .
this is special agent morgan .
we &apos;re with the fbi .
we heard that you ran uh
fabulous fun and over 40 ?
this is the house .
phil ! the fbi is here !
oh come in .
thank you .
sir i totally appreciate the confidentiality
your gym provides for its members
but this is a murder investigation so obviously--
hello ?
uncooperative .
kevin honey say something helpful .
i &apos;m almost done with members and employees .
outside venders are gonna be tough though .
it looks like a lot of these guys are paid under the table .
i know . w @-@ 2s are useless .
look at original service records only .
what is this operating system you &apos;re working ?
the search parameters are completely backwards .
ok first of all i created that program
and second of all it is a poor carpenter and hacker
who blames his tools .
miss garcia .
paul wilson &apos;s family is here for interviews .
but we &apos;re about to deliver the profile .
there &apos;s no one here to talk to them .
well they &apos;re here .
uh ... can--can you ask them to wait ?
ok .
pen are you talking to me ?
kevin compile .
detective ?
yeah ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll talk to them .
oh i miss you jj .
this unsub is an emasculated alpha male
with a near obsessive @-@ compulsive
level of control in his behavior .
and because of the repetition of details
at the crime scenes we know that his ritual is essential to him .
these patterns are how he maintains dominance
in a world he feels powerless in
both sexually and socially .
the man we &apos;re looking for is a troilist .
do you know what that is ?
it means that he gets off
on staging a scene and participating in it .
such as recording sexual acts on camera
or coming to parties like yours .
the point is the performance .
do you know who his partner is ?
uh partner ?
when he comes to the parties .
he has to bring a female companion
or he wouldn &apos;t get in the door .
see swing clubs are a matriarchy .
my primary goal as a hostess
is to make sure other women feel safe and secure .
there has to be at least as many women as men .
actually we hadn &apos;t considered that .
what else do you know about him ?
paul wilson &apos;s attack showed him
how physically weak he was
and debra wilson &apos;s enticement reminded him of how futile his fantasies were .
and as a result of this
this unsub is what we call decompensating .
now what does that mean ?
we use it to describe the collapse
of ocd patterns that mentally ill patients use to cope .
once one fails they generally all do .
in this case the unsub &apos;s ritualized fantasy has stopped working
and that makes him incredibly dangerous .
so what was his fantasy ?
two men one woman-- how would that work ?
well he comes with his female companion .
then he &apos;d most likely invite a man in .
wait a minute .
this guy is an alpha male .
wouldn &apos;t he be too possessive to share his partner ?
sure . unless he was married .
well why married ?
oh because the erotic charge of the role play
is the consensual cheating .
you don &apos;t control a girlfriend the way you control a wife .
the husband chooses his wife &apos;s partner for her .
usually not married .
it makes the cheating hotter .
then at a certain point
he steps in .
and shows his sexual superiority .
he proves to the room and his wife that he &apos;s the only one
who can satisfy her .
until his impotence destroyed his ability to do that .
suddenly he &apos;s not the only one questioning his manhood
she is too .
so maybe she cheated on him or maybe she left
but either way his wife was his first loss of control .
and if he &apos;s decompensating
she &apos;s the pattern he &apos;ll attack next as part of his breakdown .
her or women like her .
the end result of decompensation
is a temporary psychotic break .
he &apos;ll revisit old patterns to see if they still work .
and when he finds that they don &apos;t
he &apos;ll be compelled to destroy them
and anyone engaging in them .
how are you ?
oh excuse me .
hello leslie .
james .
what a pleasant surprise .
where &apos;s your wife ?
maryann &apos;s coming later .
well you know the rules of my house .
she &apos;s right behind me .
i swear .
well she better be .
are you almost done ?
i can &apos;t look at this any longer .
almost ma &apos;am .
the gunman tonight did you know him ?
james .
he and his wife maryann were fixtures here a year ago .
then they just stopped coming .
do you have a last name ?
no . we don &apos;t share personal details like that .
so you have sex
but you don &apos;t ask for last names ?
all of the victims here tonight were men .
do you happen to know why ?
no .
do you know if he had the chance
to shoot any women ?
i was in the playroom with my friend .
and we locked the door when the shooting started .
and he came in
and he just looked at me like i was nothing .
so no no i have no idea what he was after .
i &apos;m just glad it wasn &apos;t me .
ms. sanders if the door was locked
how did he get in ?
this was the last victim .
the unsub came from the living room into here .
morgan says the hostess locked herself in here .
it didn &apos;t seem to slow him down .
this is a deadbolt .
the unsub could have easily shot his way through .
he picked the lock ?
he &apos;d only do that out of habit .
the deadbolt &apos;s designed for security .
it takes expertise to get past that .
you think he &apos;s a locksmith ?
we knew he was stalking his victims at the gym
but we never knew how he got into their lives .
but when you &apos;re working out
where &apos;s the one place you leave everything personal ?
in a locker .
once the unsub finds an alpha male
he can pick the lock
get their address off their driver &apos;s license
and duplicate their keys in his work van outside .
that &apos;s the missing piece to his m.o.
he got everything he needed
from these men before they left the shower .
garcia &apos;s already ruled out gym employees and members .
how &apos;s he getting in ?
could be a third @-@ party vendor
called in to install the lockers .
and called back when someone loses their key .
all right . come back to the station . we &apos;ll work this up .
garcia i need you to pull all the locksmiths
that the gym contracts out to .
oh that &apos;s gonna take some time .
why ?
because i &apos;m still gathering the vendors
and not all the websites list the trainers that work there .
did you call them ?
of course i called them .
but some were cooperative and some weren &apos;t so i--
garcia i told you to come to me if you got stuck .
look you know usually i can do this kind of thing in no time
but this office is a revolving door of people bugging me
and i cannot do two jobs at once !
oh my god sir i &apos;m so sorry .
garcia there are 8 new victims as of tonight
and more people are going to die .
i need you to shut out all distractions
and give me everything you &apos;ve got .
yes sir . i &apos;m here . i &apos;m present . hit me .
the unsub &apos;s a locksmith . i need employee rolls--
of lock and key companies . i &apos;m so on it .
thank you .
hotch .
yeah .
we need to rethink this unsub &apos;s decompensation .
we thought his wife would be the next logical target
especially if she left him
but if it &apos;s other men he could blame them
for breaking up his marriage .
it &apos;s the same thought process
that started him hunting alpha males to begin with .
and what does that tell us about where he might be going ?
nothing . but it might tell us where he &apos;s been .
decompensation means he &apos;s returning to his old patterns
his old habits .
maybe he did this before .
after his wife left he sought out some of her partners and killed them .
you want to look at unsolved murders ?
crowley can pull them for us
match them based on the unsub &apos;s caliber .
good . you might also need to
give garcia a hand working the locksmith angle .
is there some reason she can &apos;t cover that on her own ?
she &apos;s juggling two jobs . she might need some help .
yeah . yeah i appreciate that . thank you for the information .
ok . bye @-@ bye .
how are you holding up ?
um the gyms found out about the massacre
so now they &apos;re giving me information on the locksmiths
and that &apos;s a whole other can of worms . and ...
i &apos;m fine .
garcia ...
morgan people are going to die because of me .
that &apos;s not true .
yes it is .
jj did so much .
i am in so over my head
i &apos;m swimming-- oh my god i hate these things .
here let me help .
take them out . where &apos;s your saline ?
front pocket of my bag .
you know what your only mistake has been since you started ?
oh hooray . more criticism .
you are trying to replace jj .
nobody can replace jj .
now take the other one out too .
i &apos;m not trying to replace her .
i &apos;m trying to do this job the way she &apos;d want it done .
you know what jj would want ?
she &apos;d want you to find a way
to do this job on your own terms .
play to your strengths .
ok all my extensive knowledge
of operating systems and internet protocol
is not really gonna help me out here .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m talking about .
what are you talking about ?
you need to go o.g.
original garcia .
derek morgan i &apos;m a little blind right now
but it appears the rough blur that is you
just threw out my only pair of contact lenses .
there she is .
i know you .
how often do i tell you i love you ?
every day . it &apos;s implied .
now ... the locksmiths .
can i help ?
you just did .
i know what to do .
deacon &apos;s lock and key . this is deacon .
hello . this is penny garcia . i &apos;m with the phone company .
i paid this month .
oh we &apos;re the phone company so we know that .
i &apos;m calling because one of your employees is past due
and he listed you as his most recent employer .
i don &apos;t have any employees .
well that settles that then .
i &apos;m just going to turn this over to the irs .
no wait a minute . wait a minute .
i have a few guys i free @-@ lance out to .
who are you looking for ?
well i &apos;m glad you asked &apos; cause this is my pickle .
i have a gentleman that uses a bunch of different last names
but he keeps using the same first name
james over and over .
and the password is maryann on all of his accounts .
james thomas .
he wouldn &apos;t happen to be working tonight would he ?
supposed to .
didn &apos;t show .
ok . thank you very much . bye @-@ bye .
i got it !
got what ?
the unsub .
his name is james thomas .
he did work at all the gyms the husbands went to .
is that not enough information ? oh i have so much more .
last year he suffered from a condition called
prostatic hyperdysplasia . routine surgery took a wrong turn
snip snip they had to remove the whole prostate tamale .
boss says he didn &apos;t show up for work today but this ...
is his home address .
garcia you should have let me know
before you contacted his employer .
otherwise well done .
we need a swat team at this address .
i &apos;m on it .
yes .

that &apos;s leslie sanders &apos; house
where you and james used to swing .
james is not a ...
he wouldn &apos;t do that .
he would maryann .
he would because he knows he &apos;s not the father of your baby .
that &apos;s not true . james is the father .
she &apos;s not going to give him up .
she &apos;s the wife of an alpha male .
she depends on him psychologically .
is there any chance that the unsub is the father ?
garcia said the prostate surgery was over a year ago
and there &apos;s no record of insemination .
so how do we get her to admit it ?
we need to ground her back into reality
give her something to hold on to for truth .
did you get those files we asked for
the unsolved murders ?
yeah . i can have them here in 5 minutes .
great thanks . if the unsub did kill someone in those files
it &apos;s most likely the father of her child .
if it &apos;s an old swinging partner he &apos;d be easy to track down .
that &apos;s risky . if we show her the files and he &apos;s not in there
we could lose her for good .
yeah but if the father is in there
it could shake her loose .
that baby is the only
thing she would prioritize over her husband .
i think i can do it . i can get her to cooperate .
how ?
right now two alpha males are in there
attacking her marriage . she &apos;ll react the same way
to anyone challenging her husband &apos;s dominance .
but i &apos;m not a threat . i think she &apos;ll listen to me .
so i read this pretty fascinating theory recently .
it said that humans weren &apos;t designed to be monogamous
that in our hunter @-@ gatherer phase
women took several mates .
the idea was that if the men in the tribe
didn &apos;t know who the father was
they &apos;d all be more invested in the child .
interesting right ?
i guess .
truthfully your lifestyle
is um it &apos;s a sociological marvel .
don &apos;t get me wrong . i don &apos;t judge it or you .
but i do think that the only reason you got into that
was to make your husband happy .
just like you only got pregnant after his surgery
to make him happy
only i don &apos;t think that it &apos;s working .
that &apos;s not true .
james is overjoyed to be a father .
so he didn &apos;t change around like
month 4 or 5 of the pregnancy
when you started to show ?
he didn &apos;t get moody or withdrawn or anything ?
how about last night
when he came home with cuts and bruises ?
didn &apos;t you ask him about that ?
no .
so maryann i know this is hard to hear
but i think that your pregnancy
drove your husband to try to recreate those parties
so he could feel in control again .
only instead of swinging
he &apos;s killing people .
why won &apos;t you people listen to me ?
he &apos;s not capable of doing that .
how about killing the man who got you pregnant ?
do you think he &apos;s capable of that ?
no .
because you &apos;d be lying .
this is his baby .
these files are recent unsolved murders
men who have been killed since you conceived .
now if i &apos;m right about your husband
i think that the father of your child is somewhere in here .
bob atkins ? is it him ?
i can &apos;t believe this .
james boyd ?
you don &apos;t give up do you ?
you just can &apos;t accept the fact that my husband and i
love each other .
yes we have an unconventional marriage
but that &apos;s not a crime .
we have a strong relationship .
james respects me .
he would never do anything--
it went straight to voice mail .
he must have turned it off .
maryann we need you to tell us
what you and your husband used to do before you got married .
what your habits were .
you mean like where we went on dates ?
no your sexual habits .
think of it . you don &apos;t just jump into swinging .
most people have games building up to it .
what were they ?
he &apos;d sometimes pretend to pick me up .
what does that mean ?
we &apos;d meet at a bar .
i &apos;d arrive and he wouldn &apos;t be there .
he was in the back watching me .
what were the names of the bars you went to ?
just one . dunley &apos;s . it &apos;s at the town mall .
and how did the game end ?
he &apos;d make me dress provocatively .
he wanted guys to hit on me
and then when i &apos;d show some interest--
james would step in seduce you back to him ?
he &apos;s in the middle of the bar .
there &apos;s no way to take him down
without risking collateral damage .
if we go in there he &apos;ll start shooting up the place .
he &apos;ll do that anyway .
this guy &apos;s looking for a spark .
then we &apos;ll need a distraction .
what are you doing ?
he &apos;s gone back to his old patterns .
he wants to play the game he played with his wife .
debra wilson played that game and it got her killed prentiss .
all right keep his focus off the crowd
long enough for us to take him down .
you guys better have my back .
we will .
james .
hey ! i thought that was you .
how &apos;s maryann ?
oh you don &apos;t remember me do you ?
we met at a-- a party .
we did ?
yeah . that was a--
that was a crazy night .
i &apos;ll bet it was .
emily .
um it was halloween .
ok tell me if this rings a bell .
uh you asked if we were interested in maryann
and then you and i watched for a while
and then you joined in .
brian didn &apos;t stop talking about that for weeks .
look look look look .
i &apos;m sorry i really don &apos;t remember you .
it &apos;s ok .
so do you still hit the scene ?
no i don &apos;t .
hmm . yeah me neither .
i came tonight uh
hoping to find a real man .
lucky for me i found you .
so we have met ?
so where &apos;s brian ?
oh he &apos;s not around anymore .
yeah . well that happens .
lose your boyfriend .
the scene will definitely do that .
you know i &apos;m not that torn up about it .
there &apos;ll be other boyfriends .
you know there &apos;s only uh
only one way to make the lifestyle really work .
you gotta choose someone who &apos;s stable .
who &apos;s uh secure .
in fact maryann and i have a uh
little secret system we worked out .
you want to know what that is ?
i always choose husbands for her ...
never boyfriends .
i don &apos;t know you .
and you don &apos;t know me .
move move .
fbi ! nobody move !
the situation is under control . you &apos;re not in danger .
you need help ?
are you all right ?
tell ... tell ... tell maryann ...
tell maryann ...
i will .
&quot; we all wear masks and the time comes
when we cannot remove them without removing our own skin . &quot;
andre berthiaume .
garcia ...
sir i &apos;m scanning the open case files .
my plan is to have this office paperless in a month .
that can wait .
when gideon left the bau
i found myself taking on too much responsibility .
and i quickly realized that
i could only do the job that i was good at .
i &apos;ve seen you give everything to this case and to this team
for the last few days
but the truth is we need you here .
oh thank god .
sir i do not want that job . i mean--
i want part of the job .
i want the part that keeps me here
&apos;cause here i &apos;m mozart
but out there i was like a monkey playing the trumpet
and you guys need mozart .
you did fine .
what if we split up the job ?
you can handle intake and resources here at quantico
we can cover the rest in the field
and when we need you you &apos;ll still travel with us .
you can do that ?
of course .
but i let you down .
in no way whatsoever .
i kind of lost my marbles out there .
garcia when you applied for this job
you gave me your resume on homemade pink stationery .
i realized then that you were ... unique .
and i wouldn &apos;t want you to change that .
good night .
