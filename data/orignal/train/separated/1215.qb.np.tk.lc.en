mona , we need your help .
we just found out that ali &apos;s at the police station .
she &apos;s talking to the cops .
but i &apos;m already number one on her hit list .
if alison finds out i &apos;m siding with you guys ,
i &apos;m afraid to think of how far she &apos;d go to stop me .
we never had our talk .
i &apos;m tired of talking .
happy graduation .
spence .
i love you .
i wonder if i can trust anyone in that family .
did alison know bethany ?
where are you ?
wait , i can &apos;t hear you .
spencer hastings , you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of bethany young .
i @-@ i @-@ i didn &apos;t do this .
where are we going ?
to mona &apos;s .
she found proof .
oh , my god . mona !
although we did not find a body ,
we have ruled this a homicide .
so what did you get for toby ?
i &apos;m abstaining from christmas this year , remember ?
when you &apos;re out on bail for murder ,
it just feels like the right thing to do .
and he &apos;s okay with that ?
well , he agreed to not giving presents
if i agreed to surprising each other with a gesture .
like the clowns ?
what clowns ?
court jesters . they &apos;re clowns , right ?
i &apos;ve always loved these windows .
let &apos;s make a wish .
yeah , let &apos;s make a wish for spencer .
guys , santa is not bringing me a stay @-@ out @-@ of @-@ jail @-@ free card .
han , want a snowflake ?
the last time i was here , it was with mona .
what &apos;d you wish for ?
you &apos;re my first friend , hanna .
i wished for us to always stay close .
we will .
besties forever .
i promise .
so what &apos;d you wish for ?
jimmy choos .
oh , you &apos;re getting those .
i am ?
if santa doesn &apos;t bring &apos; em , we &apos;ll steal &apos; em .
wishes don &apos;t come true , emily .
if they did , people wouldn &apos;t die .
i &apos;m still holding out hope .
hope is a dirty four @-@ letter word .
we live in an &quot; a &quot; world .
they still haven &apos;t found mona &apos;s body .
yeah , that &apos;s because
&quot; a &quot; likes to bury the bodies herself .
yeah , and then throw ice balls .
i swear alison is throwing this party
to rub it in our faces .
i ruined your lives and now i &apos;m the belle of the ball .
technically , she only ruined my life .
ruin one of us , ruin all of us .
yeah , i &apos;d rather dance on dead monkeys
than go to ali &apos;s stupid ice ball .
dead monkeys ?
ali got everything she wanted .
mona &apos;s gone , bethany &apos;s dead ,
and now she &apos;s making spencer go down for it .
is that a reporter or a cop ?
neither . that pen &apos;s too nice . my money &apos;s on a lawyer .
hanna marin ?
yes .
told you .
mona vanderwaal retained me to handle her affairs in the event of her demise .
i was instructed to wait 30 days after her death ,
then deliver this to you personally .
merry christmas .
bah humbug .
i &apos;m afraid to open it .
these are drawings of ali &apos;s house .
yeah , and all of her hiding places .
it &apos;s from mona .
&quot; hey , han . if you &apos;re reading this ... &quot;
she &apos;s still playing the game
and i &apos;m talking to you from the grave .
but i went out fighting and that &apos;s what you need to do .
promise me you won &apos;t give up , hanna .
you have to keep looking .
kisses , m.
i promised mona we &apos;d always stick together .
well , you have to figure , &quot; a &quot; keeps souvenirs , right ?
you mean alison .
different name , same bitch .
there has to be something in ali &apos;s house that proves
she killed bethany .
and spencer didn &apos;t .
i think mona just handed us a way
to give you a christmas , spence .
and your stay @-@ out @-@ of @-@ jail @-@ free card .
hey , santa .
thank you .
oh , my god .
is that us ?
&quot; &apos; a &apos; takes a holiday .
you should , too . &quot;
mom .
she &apos;s got a lot to show you .
pay attention .
i know you &apos;d told me never to leave the house
without my face on , but as a corpse ,
this is the best i can do for your ice ball .
this isn &apos;t real .
you were quite the little pianist .
is that me ?
you don &apos;t remember ?
it &apos;s not pretty .
but you need to see it .
see what ?
wait for it .
alison !
i didn &apos;t mean to ,
but i found your hiding place .
did you and daddy give me the same present ?
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
daddy will think it &apos;s funny when i tell him .
there are not two dresses .
i think you need glasses .
you only saw one dress .
you found the present , one present .
you opened it and there was one dress .
why , mommy ?
because i don &apos;t want daddy to leave us .
and he will , if you tell him about the dresses .
i &apos;ll say whatever you want me to .
good girl .
now tell me what happened .
the real story .
i was playing the piano .
i looked inside of it and found one present ,
one yellow dress .
good girl .
one more time .
i was playing the piano .
i looked inside of it and found one present ,
one yellow dress .
and the monster was born .
who was the other dress for ?
was it bethany ?
it &apos;s not going to be that easy , bitch .
ali made hiding things into a game .
you &apos;re out on bail for a murder charge , spencer .
well , it &apos;s not a perfect plan ,
but it &apos;s all i &apos;ve got .
and i saw the look on my mom &apos;s face
after we met my lawyers for the last time .
we &apos;ve already lost .
it &apos;s not over yet .
but , hey , what if ali leaves the dance early ?
she won &apos;t .
aria and emily are gonna find a reason
to keep her there .
and you will be here to warn us if anything goes wrong .
i thought everybody was splitting up on christmas .
no , we &apos;re all gonna catch up with our parents
before the snow starts .
mm , sounds like you &apos;ve got it all figured out .
toby , this might be my last christmas .
spencer ...
so ...
merry @-@ ho @-@ ho .
nice gesture .
thanks .
merry christmas .
merry christmas to you , too .
merry christmas .
okay , where &apos;s my friend claire ?
i haven &apos;t signed since fat camp .
my bunkmate was hard of hearing .
merry christmas .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m pretty sure that some kid peed on me ,
and that mean little girl ,
she keeps calling me dumb @-@ dumb .
what mean girl ?
ali &apos;s little mini @-@ me .
right there , there she is .
call her anything you want .
she can &apos;t hear you .
get over here .
all of you .
i &apos;m only gonna say this once .
you mess with claire , you deal with me .
i &apos;m shaking with fear .
you better start looking over your shoulder ,
because you &apos;re making a lot of enemies .
and in rosewood , bitches get buried .
this place blows . let &apos;s get out of here .
hey , you guys , you don &apos;t need a leader .
you just need each other .
i said let &apos;s go !
losers .
well , i would say that
you put the fear of hanna in her .
well , mona used to say when someone shows you
who they are , believe them .
i don &apos;t think people change , caleb .
they just get better at hiding it .
but mean girls stay mean .
cookie ?
i know you wanted to keep it low @-@ key this holiday ,
but this is for tonight .
is it an ali @-@ decoder ring ?
ezra , they &apos;re beautiful .
thank you .
and mandi at the boutique
said it might go well with this .
all right , if this is low @-@ key ,
i &apos;m afraid to ask what full @-@ on christmas
looks like at the fitzgerald house .
oh , yeah , don &apos;t ask .
it &apos;s like how many ponies can you get ?
seriously ?
no .
ezra ?
well , i got two ponies , but i only asked for one .
merry christmas .
you got a minute ?
what do you want ?
so it looks like you and paige worked things out .
why doesn &apos;t jenna come over here and talk to me ?
and you don &apos;t have to be her eyes and ears .
she can still hear , right ?
jenna &apos;s not a bad person .
you just wouldn &apos;t know that because
alison convinced you that she was the enemy .
is that all ?
all right , i just wanted to say merry christmas .
it &apos;s not what i want .
it &apos;s what you want .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
my parents want me to come to california after christmas .
well , that sounds like a fun winter break .
look up .
well , let &apos;s see how you look .
it &apos;s a christmas miracle .
i still don &apos;t see ali anywhere .
she &apos;s probably waiting to make her grand entrance .
timed to the perfect song .
well , we can &apos;t leave until she gets here , so ...
i &apos;m going to go have my picture taken with santa claus .
i think you know what i want for christmas .
and i think you know i &apos;ll do whatever i can to help you get it .
hanna and i are headed to her house
the second ali gets here .
we &apos;ll make sure she stays here , spencer .
you &apos;ve been a very good girl this year .
santa won &apos;t let you down .
lucas ...
paige said that ali was building her own army .
be careful tonight .
we can &apos;t trust anyone .
whoa , check it out !
who are those other girls ?
let &apos;s get out of here while everyone &apos;s still basking in the glow of ali .
hanna .
be careful .
who is that ?
aren &apos;t you supposed to be on &quot; a &quot; watch ?
yeah . you need to see this .
what is it ?
i just saw ali kissing santa claus .
come on .
jeez , hanna !
do not sneak up on me like that .
i &apos;m sorry .
okay , if we &apos;re the only ones here , why are we whispering ?
i don &apos;t know .
can we just talk in a normal voice ?
because this is spooking me out .
here , you take the upstairs .
i &apos;ll take the downstairs .
okay , on a creepy scale ,
how high would you rate breaking into ali &apos;s house ?
on a scale of 1 to 10 , it &apos;s a 20 .
they were just here .
was it a guy or a girl ?
guy .
are you sure ?
yes , i &apos;m sure .
i definitely got a sense of &quot; male butt . &quot;
okay , well , i &apos;m gonna go take my photo with santa claus .
come in closer to santa claus .
merry christmas !
you &apos;re on my list , aria .
the naughty one .
surprised to see you here .
yeah , not as surprised as i am to see you .
it &apos;s a charity ball .
giving back to my community .
i didn &apos;t realize that rosewood was your community .
the town has a lot to offer .
it &apos;s starting to grow on me .
that &apos;s spoken like a guy who maybe met a girl that he likes .
what brings you out tonight , aria ?
same as you .
it feels good to give back .
i don &apos;t know why i have such a hard time believing you .
my boyfriend &apos;s probably looking for me .
that &apos;s a pretty dress .
tell ezra i think he has good taste .
aria and emily lost alison .
oh , well , i think i just found her .
merry christmas , aly .
you don &apos;t need to be afraid .
i led you here ,
because i don &apos;t want alison to see us talking .
you really get around , sydney .
does jenna know you &apos;re with ali now ?
when i first moved to rosewood ,
alison offered to be my friend .
i made the mistake of saying no .
when she asked me this time
i gave her the right answer .
i promise you , we &apos;re not the enemy .
no , you &apos;re just sleeping with the enemy .
i &apos;m not gay , emily .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
look , until someone puts ali away ,
we &apos;re doing what we have to do to survive .
i &apos;m sure you and your friends understand that .
we think she killed mona .
we do , too .
alison ?
there &apos;s this shop in le marais
that helps you make your own fragrance .
it &apos;s a tiny store ,
but i spent the entire day there .
the owner gets you talking .
and the next thing you know , he &apos;s created a scent
that &apos;s perfect for the person you &apos;re telling him about .
thank you .
not just for the perfume , but for coming to see me .
when you lose someone ,
the first christmas is always the hardest .
i think my mom is still looking out for me .
i &apos;m sure she is .
i had a dream about her the other night .
she came to warn me about mona .
mona can &apos;t hurt you anymore .
you know that .
you can &apos;t let your guard down , ali .
your ex @-@ friends are here tonight .
and i don &apos;t think they came to say merry christmas .
what did you find , hanna ?
if the winds pick up ,
we could be looking at blizzard conditions
for the rosewood area on this blustery christmas eve .
but don &apos;t worry , kids , santa has rudolph
to navigate his sleigh .
does the name holly varjak mean anything to you ?
spence ?
what , hanna ?
if ali needs to get out of town in a hurry ,
she &apos;s ready to go as holly varjak .
she &apos;s writing her happy ending .
to what ?
breakfast at tiffany &apos;s .
probably the movie , not the book .
ezra always says that she was his &quot; holly golightly . &quot;
and paul varjak was the guy who convinced holly
that it was okay to be loved .
so in ali &apos;s manic mind , they got married .
how do you fit all of that information into your one head ?
what are those ?
ali was talking to somebody through the personal ads .
like she did with mona back when mona was &quot; a. &quot;
if ali was kissing holbrook , that would explain a lot .
yeah , like why spencer &apos;s about to go on trial for murder
while ali &apos;s weaving her way through a winter wonderland .
ezra , what is it ?
well , if holbrook is helping ali ,
i want to know when it started .
oh , my god .
i promised ali i wouldn &apos;t tell
because i thought i was protecting everyone .
but cece showed up in new york that night .
and ali helped to get her out of the country .
you think holbrook was in on it ?
i think he helped cece escape .
and he did it for ali .
looks like ali made a friend .
she went in there alone .
they &apos;re heading towards the exit .
so is holbrook .
you guys follow ali .
we &apos;ve got santa .
i &apos;ll grab lucas .
detective holbrook .
may i have a word with you for a second ?
sure .
you &apos;re leaving your own party , ali ?
what &apos;s the rush ?
alison ?
get out of my stuff
or i &apos;ll kill you !
where are you , hanna ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
we think ali left the party .
i tried calling hanna but she &apos;s not picking up .
damn it .
we &apos;re our way .
hanna , you &apos;ve got to get out of there .
where did you go ?
mad hatter ?
mad hatter .
hanna !
god , i only had one pen pal .
ali had a fan club .
&quot; can &apos;t wait to see you . &quot;
oh , my god .
ali knew bethany .
and she invited her here for labor day .
damn it , where are you ?
spence ?
spencer ?
hanna ?
spencer ?
come on .
come on , hanna . come on .
hanna !
hanna ?
come on .
hanna ?
hey , please , please , please , wake up .
it &apos;s okay .
oh , my god .
are you okay ?
hanna ?
it &apos;s okay , she &apos;s gone .
she &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s okay , she &apos;s gone .
you &apos;re okay .
hey , you &apos;re okay .
give mom and grandma bea a big kiss for me .
and i promise i &apos;ll be on the road as soon as it &apos;s clear .
thanks , dad .
i love you , too .
this is amazing .
hanna , this letter proves that alison knew bethany
and lured her here on labor day .
this could create enough reasonable doubt to clear spencer .
i don &apos;t want to say the &quot; h &quot; word ,
but i am feeling cautiously optimistic tonight .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
and her heart grew three sizes that day .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
* hark the herald angels sing . *
* glory to the newborn king *
how was the party ?
ignoring me won &apos;t make me go away .
it &apos;ll just make me mad .
i &apos;m scared , okay ?
is that what you wanted to hear ?
it wasn &apos;t as gratifying as i thought it was gonna be .
what do you want me to do ?
what do you want me to say to make you go away ?
wait for it .
tell me if tiny tim will live .
do we have to watch this ?
it &apos;s depressing .
if you think you &apos;re depressed now ,
look over there .
when ?
does it matter ?
it does to me .
and only you .
you look pretty good , considering
that they never found your legs .
do i know you ?
mom .
it &apos;s all my fault .
look at me .
i &apos;m not dead .
they &apos;ll be coming for you soon .
i &apos;m sorry .
am i going to hell ?
no . no .
no !
no !
please !
let me out !
mona !
mona !
wake up , bitch !
it &apos;s christmas .
and i promise you don &apos;t want to miss it .
my mom called her friend at highway patrol .
they don &apos;t expect the roads to be cleared until tomorrow .
i &apos;m so sorry , em .
this is the first time i won &apos;t be with my parents on christmas .
yeah , me too .
you know , my mom always said christmas was wherever we were
as long as we were together .
and we are ...
together .
seriously ?
now that is a gesture .
merry christmas .
oh , my god .
hey , you okay ?
my parents don &apos;t think rosewood &apos;s a safe place anymore .
they don &apos;t want me to visit california ,
they want me to move there .
wait , before graduation ?
i &apos;ll have enough credits by the end of spring quarter .
i just thought we had more time .
mona should be here tonight .
the only reason we &apos;re celebrating is because of her .
christmas chicken .
yeah !
okay , let &apos;s all say a prayer .
to this family .
may we always stay together .
cheers .
cheers .
santa ?
oh , my god .
who did this ?
em ?
not me .
merry christmas , bitches .
