第二十一集
my older brother zeus stopped my heart .
what i &apos;m left with is anger .
there &apos;s only one way out of a sleeping curse --
true love &apos;s kiss .
you &apos;re not the one who &apos;s going to wake me .
my father is .
i don &apos;t even really care about that book
except for a few pages about me .
so destroy them .
what do you say , zelena ?
will you make chaos with me ?
the land of the living .
i never thought i would see this world again --
not with a beating heart .
and i owe it all to you .
do you feel this ?
yes .
i &apos;m finally becoming myself again .
i &apos;m so glad .
something &apos;s troubling you .
it &apos;s my sister .
she &apos;s still not here .
i wouldn &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m sure she made it back safe .
then why are we still in the woods ?
we should go back into town and check .
i can &apos;t .
snow white still thinks i &apos;m a villain .
these people are always looking for villains to blame .
i &apos;ll tell them you &apos;ve changed --
that love changed you .
it certainly did .
but ...
in case they don &apos;t believe me ,
would -- would you mind taking the baby ?
just take her to my sister &apos;s office .
you &apos;ll be safe there .
what , you -- you would trust me with your daughter ?
i trust you with anything .
hello there .
don &apos;t let the shackles fool you .
i &apos;m king arthur of camelot .
i was unjustly imprisoned . please .
unjustly imprisoned .
that , i understand .
thank you .
but tell me , what happened
to land you in such an awful predicament ?
i was destined to rule a kingdom ,
a broken kingdom .
but not everybody is as understanding as you .
well , that i understand as well .
i , too , was destined to rule a kingdom .
who are you ?
my name is hades -- god of death .
and i think i was destined to rule this very kingdom ,
right here , but --
i will need your help .
and that will do nicely .
what do you mean arthur escaped ?
i thought you were guarding his cell .
it &apos;s not my fault .
this useless lump fell asleep on watch .
you put sleepy on guard duty ?
you left for weeks .
it was the best i could do with who i had .
all right , well , we can blame each other later .
right now we need a search party .
gather the dwarfs . go .
let &apos;s go , sleepy .
i told you it was walter .
i know . i agree .
we need our family back soon .
soon enough ?
david .
hey , big guy .
oh , i missed you .
hey , mom .
emma . henry ! did everyone else --
regina and robin are here , too .
grandpa came back with belle .
at least , we think he did .
and hook ?
oh , emma .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i made so many mistakes , mom .
i should never have gone down there .
it &apos;s okay .
we all made it back .
and we helped so many people move on .
you got to see hook one last time .
well , there &apos;s more to it .
we weren &apos;t the only ones that came through the portal .
hades and zelena -- they made it back , too .
they have robin &apos;s baby .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll find her .
i promise .
regina !
you made it back .
where the hell
wait .
we need some answers .
where the hell is my daughter ?
with hades .
look , i came to explain to everyone that he &apos;s changed .
i hate to be the one to break this to you ,
but no , he hasn &apos;t !
what are you talking about ? he helped you .
he took your names off your graves .
no , it was a trick so we &apos;d trust him .
he tried to trap us down there .
what ? no , no , no .
i was with him the whole time .
we waited for you .
that was a show for your benefit .
you cannot trust him with your daughter .
you &apos;re wrong .
hades is different now his heart is beating .
love has changed him . i &apos;ve changed him .
i know you want to believe that .
sometimes the truth really hurts .
why don &apos;t you just tell us where he is ?
and what are you planning to do when you find him ?
well , that depends on him .
but we &apos;ll do whatever we have to to protect this town .
you mean imprison him .
we &apos;ll do whatever we have to .
i know this is hard to hear ,
but he is not the man you think he is .
actually , he &apos;s not a man at all .
he &apos;s a god .
and if you try to hurt him ,
you do so at your own peril .
excuse me .
can you tell me where i am exactly ?
he stopped talking centuries ago .
coffee ?
no , i don &apos;t want coffee .
i want to know what this place is !
i think that &apos;s quite obvious , your majesty .
you got lucky last time we met .
now you tell me where i am or i run you through .
well , you can &apos;t kill a dead man , i &apos;m afraid .
are you having a hard time accepting it ?
but you know where you are .
no .
but i had so much left to do .
that makes two of us .
i promised someone that i would move on from this place ,
but i still bloody can &apos;t ,
so i need to know what the hell is going on up in storybrooke .
who killed you ?
oh , no ! no ! no !
denial , grief , anger . can we just get to acceptance ?
who killed you ?
he said his name was hades .
did you see emma and the others ?
have they any idea how to stop him ?
haven &apos;t you learned anything ?
hades never reveals his weakness .
you know what ?
you &apos;re right .
hades protected his secrets well .
but now , now he &apos;s not here ,
so , your majesty , how would you like to go on another quest ?
with you ?
not a chance .
have you got any idea why you &apos;re down here , mate ...
and not up in some blissful afterlife or fiery hell ?
it &apos;s because you are a terrible king
with loads of unfinished business .
when you leave here ,
you &apos;re either going to the better place
or a far , far worse place .
i think i prefer the first option .
oh , and you &apos;re gonna need a seriously good deed ,
you know , to make up for the bad ones .
if i say &quot; yes , &quot; what exactly are we questing for ?
an answer to defeating hades .
and you can call it my holy grail .
this is where i found him .
i always thought i &apos;d be the one to put him in his grave ,
but now that i see him like this ,
i can &apos;t help but feel sorry for him .
hades did this .
how do you know ?
i know .
if we don &apos;t stop him , this is just the beginning .
what do you mean by &quot; stop him &quot; ?
i mean kill him and send him back where he came from .
emma , wait . wait !
slow down .
this is a god we &apos;re dealing with ,
and we still have no idea how to hurt him .
doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t try .
look , i get it .
hook &apos;s gone . you &apos;re in pain .
this isn &apos;t about hook .
yes , it is .
i am trying to protect storybrooke .
are you telling me i shouldn &apos;t fight hades ?
no , of course we &apos;re gonna fight him ,
but i need you seeing clearly before we do that .
so maybe it &apos;s time you start dealing with death
the way other people do .
how do other people deal with death ?
they grieve .
i thought regina trusted me .
she threatened you to my face .
they &apos;re going to try to hurt you .
if anything happened to you ...
or the baby , i couldn &apos;t live with it .
i have to turn myself in .
you &apos;d really give up your freedom ...
for me ?
for you ...
i would give up anything .
wait .
i can &apos;t let you do this .
i won &apos;t risk losing you again .
well ...
well , then we have only one other option --
we have to defend ourselves .
yes , of course .
i &apos;ll put up a protection spell .
what if they break through ?
well , then we &apos;ll make them see the truth !
or we &apos;ll fight back .
i hope it doesn &apos;t come to a fight ,
but if they force us into it , i do have something .
what ?
a family heirloom .
the olympian crystal .
it belonged to by brother zeus .
very powerful .
very dangerous .
and i &apos;ve waited a long time to use it .
my sister cast a protection spell on the building .
we can &apos;t just stand here and do nothing .
i wasn &apos;t planning on doing nothing .
as a matter of fact , i know exactly what to do .
there &apos;s a secret tunnel that goes right under the town hall .
we don &apos;t know how to defeat hades ,
but maybe we can get your daughter back
and talk some sense into zelena ,
if you &apos;re with me .
of course i am .
then i &apos;m going , too .
no offense , emma , but you &apos;re too emotional .
i @-@ i understand . you had a loss .
but you &apos;re not thinking straight .
is that you th-- is that what you all think ?
emma . we still don &apos;t know how to stop hades .
until we do --
so then we figure it out .
so , well , then do it quickly .
because once we get that baby back ,
hades will be coming for us .
look , i &apos;m --
i &apos;m sorry i trusted zelena with your daughter .
glad to finally hear it .
just for once , i was trying to be optimistic
and give her a second chance like you gave me .
you deserved it . she doesn &apos;t .
all she wants is what i have .
i made her think love was possible .
so you &apos;re -- you &apos;re not actually apologizing .
you &apos;re defending her again .
robin , no --
no , forgive me if i don &apos;t care to listen .
i have a daughter to save .
what the hell do you want ?
no need to be testy .
i &apos;m here on belle &apos;s behalf .
well , then she can come talk to me herself .
she can &apos;t , i &apos;m afraid .
she &apos;s trapped under a sleeping curse .
there &apos;s only one way to wake her .
true love &apos;s kiss .
and yours didn &apos;t work .
glad to hear some good sense for her at last .
she needs her father .
you &apos;re right .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m not gonna do it .
not for you .
what , y @-@ you hate me so much ,
you &apos;d leave your own daughter trapped under a sleeping spell ?
better that than the spell you put on her ,
convincing that beautiful girl to love you .
so , until you &apos;re gone for good , she stays asleep .
yeah , you know , i was afraid you were gonna say that ,
so , uh , i brought along an old friend .
remember the taste of this ?
i don &apos;t care what you do to me .
i &apos;ll die before i give in .
well , i &apos;m more than happy to test that theory .
enough ! get out . go .
what are you doing here ? i need your help .
ms. swan .
nice to see you made it back from the underworld .
i &apos;m not the only one who made it back .
hades is in storybrooke .
i have to stop him .
so i was hoping ...
you could tell me how to kill him .
well , even if i knew , why would i tell you ?
you &apos;re the one that got us into this mess .
if there &apos;s a way to defeat hades ,
the answer will have to be in here .
what is this place ?
it &apos;s his throne room , or dungeon , depending on his mood .
last time i was here , i spent most of my time at the end of a lash .
sounds like this hades was an even worse king than i was .
what exactly is this holy grail we &apos;re looking for ?
it &apos;s pages from a storybook .
i know it doesn &apos;t sound like much ,
but hades went to great lengths to keep them from us .
and i think these pages can tell us his weakness .
all we have to do is find them .
there &apos;s nothing here .
maybe you were wrong about this .
i can &apos;t be wrong !
hades is out there now , threatening emma ,
and i bloody well need to find a way to save her .
i get it now .
this is all about a woman .
aye .
a woman who risked everything for me ,
and the last promise i made her
was that i would move on from this place ,
and i can &apos;t do that --
not while she &apos;s still in danger .
now , please . come on , you -- you were a king once .
where did you hide your treasure ?
the most important stuff ,
i hid in a place no one would ever dare touch .
my throne .
well , look at that .
your holy grail .
i have to get this to emma .
what have you found ?
the one answer she &apos;s been looking for most of all --
the way to destroy a god .
i thought you guys would come back soon .
i smelled a bromance .
table for two ?
we &apos;re not here for a meal , we &apos;re here for her .
oh , back up .
seriously , back up .
let me take a gander
at this handsome new addition to the underworld .
we have to get a message to our friends in the world above .
and you ripped out the phone booth that can do that .
now , where is it ?
oh , as appealing as this stubble sandwich is ,
i &apos;m pretty certain lying to you won &apos;t get me what i want .
you &apos;ll eventually work out the truth ,
so here it is and on your way .
i destroyed the phone booth .
sorry .
why would you do that ?
because , darling , i can &apos;t have anyone
resolving their unfinished business .
that would be no fun .
and if i &apos;m going to be trapped in here ,
so is everyone else .
the book .
where is it ?
in sight , but out of reach .
i put it in the river of souls .
if we can get our hands on that book ,
i may have a way to get those pages to emma .
emma , where have you been ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . it was a dead @-@ end .
you guys find anything ?
oh , are you kidding ? we &apos;re literally drowning in books .
there &apos;s got to be something in here about hades ,
but we just started , so ...
oh , we could really use your help .
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t have time to go through a bunch of books .
i should &apos;ve gone after hades when i had the chance .
emma , wait .
we know you &apos;re hurting .
but getting revenge on hades is not gonna bring hook back .
this is not about revenge .
then what is it about , emma ?
i cannot grieve hook &apos;s death
because i know he &apos;s still trapped in the underworld .
i know he &apos;s still in pain ,
and the last thing i told him was that he needed to move on .
you &apos;re right .
we have to help hook .
so why don &apos;t you sit down and help us find a way
to defeat hades ... for hook ?
my brother didn &apos;t want me to have this ,
so he stopped my heart , broke the crystal .
without a beating heart ,
i didn &apos;t have the power to put it back together ,
but now , thanks to you ...
different story .
i &apos;m sorry your brother didn &apos;t believe in you .
don &apos;t be .
i &apos;ve only had a few thousand years to dwell on it .
and once i make this whole ,
we can show everyone they were wrong about us .
we can live any life we want .
that sounds lovely .
we could even rule this place together .
rule storybrooke ?
but i thought we were just planning to live here , you know ?
nice little house ,
my daughter playing in the garden .
yeah .
i want that , too , but ...
... these people , they &apos;re leaving us no choice .
we might have to ...
make a show of strength to survive .
hello ?
welcome to storybrooke .
rumplestiltskin .
i heard you were in town .
now , how would you like to put our sordid past behind us
and make a deal ?
oh , i don &apos;t need your deals .
you certain about that ?
you &apos;re a stranger in a strange land ...
full of enemies .
i could protect you
in exchange for a piece of that olympian crystal .
how do you know about that ?
you don &apos;t smuggle magic like that into storybrooke
without getting my attention .
we &apos;re not in your kingdom anymore ,
we &apos;re in mine .
not for long .
can &apos;t say i didn &apos;t warn you .
welcome to the town hall .
secret passage indeed .
thank you , regina .
you &apos;re welcome .
and i know you can &apos;t accept this right now ,
but i do feel horrible for what i did .
i &apos;m sorry zelena has your daughter ,
and i &apos;m really trying to make up for it .
you &apos;re right .
we do owe zelena another chance .
oh , don &apos;t just say that to appease me .
no , i &apos;m not .
if being with you has taught me anything ,
it &apos;s that we all have the capability to change .
and the future &apos;s not written by our past .
regina ...
you are my future .
okay , thief .
tell me what the plan is .
well , i always follow one rule --
don &apos;t go into a job without a good plan to get out ,
but with my daughter on the line ,
i have broken my own rule .
i @-@ i have no plan .
so if you want to turn back ...
i &apos;m with you .
always .
good .
well , then let &apos;s go save my daughter .
we &apos;re almost there .
the book should be just up ahead .
what are these things ?
they &apos;re lost souls .
careful .
touch the water , you become one of them .
there &apos;s the book .
that two @-@ tone witch was telling the truth .
i &apos;ll go . you just make sure the boat &apos;s here when i return .
release me , demon !
arthur !
no !
go for the book ! go !
thank you .
now get the book .
hook !
the torch !
you didn &apos;t tell me those things could attack us .
i didn &apos;t know they could .
perhaps things are changing down here now that hades is gone .
you sure this book can still work ?
i &apos;m not certain of anything down here ,
but this book is special .
these pages have crossed realms
when people needed hope the most .
out of professional curiosity ,
how does one kill the god of death ?
with something called an olympian crystal .
once activated , the raw power inside
can obliterate anything , even a god .
you really think emma can find this crystal and use it ?
you have a healthy dose of faith .
it &apos;s more like hope .
all right , swan .
now it &apos;s your turn .
whole again .
there . at last .
maybe we should just take this
and leave storybrooke , go and live somewhere else
where we don &apos;t have to fight anyone .
zelena .
they will hunt us wherever we go .
the only way to be safe is be strong .
i really hate him .
i can see my daughter .
but we need a distraction .
my protection spell .
someone &apos;s trying to break in .
what did i tell you ? they &apos;re coming for us .
it &apos;s emma swan .
mummy will be right back
as soon as i make sure you &apos;re safe .
i &apos;ll check who else is creeping in .
one thing i know about these people ,
they never work alone .
be careful .
you , too .
who needs a plan when you got blind luck on your side ?
good luck with that .
zelena . i @-@ i don &apos;t want to hurt you .
no .
you want to hurt hades , and that &apos;s the same thing .
but guess what ?
there &apos;s no way to defeat a god .
even gods have weaknesses ,
i know he has the crystal ,
and i know what he can do with it .
so it &apos;s true .
you are trying to kill the man i love .
now i need to know one thing .
did my sister agree to this ? !
your father &apos;s here ,
and everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
i wouldn &apos;t be so sure .
you stay away from my daughter .
believe me .
she &apos;s not the one who &apos;s in danger .
hades , stop .
this isn &apos;t worth it .
if you kill me , you will lose zelena forever .
shh . only if she knows about it .
and this isn &apos;t going to kill you ,
it &apos;s going to end you .
no underworld , no moving on .
one minute , you exist , and the next ... you don &apos;t .
that &apos;s what you get for trying to turn zelena against me .
this was my idea to break in here .
just use that on me . you let her go .
oh , sorry .
ladies first .
no !
no !
don &apos;t worry .
you won &apos;t be apart long .
regina . what happened ?
hades did this .
he said he was going to kill you , zelena .
i had to protect you .
that &apos;s a lie .
is it ?
because i &apos;ve just found emma , and these .
you wanted to kill him !
i was trying to protect you , zelena .
he &apos;s been lying to you since the minute his heart started beating .
is it true what they said ?
did you trap them in the underworld ?
i did it for you
so we wouldn &apos;t have to hurt anybody .
but now they &apos;re here , and the only way to be safe
is to use this power to create a new kingdom -- our kingdom .
can &apos;t we just be happy together ?
i mean , why do we need a kingdom ?
this is about getting back
at the families who never believed in us .
remember what i told you --
there &apos;s no better revenge --
than having it all .
it &apos;s okay .
use it .
end her .
zelena .
i do believe in you .
i defended you when no one else did .
i wanted so badly for you to find love .
but sometimes love blinds us .
hades tried to kill me already .
no , she &apos;s lying .
robin died to protect me .
that &apos;s what true love is .
it &apos;s sacrifice .
it &apos;s giving up everything for the person you love .
but hades won &apos;t give up a single thing for you .
like he said , he wants it all .
listen to her .
she doesn &apos;t think you deserve to be happy .
look at this office . look at this town .
this all belonged to her when you had nothing , remember ?
of course i do !
all you have to do is kill her ,
and you can have everything you ever wanted .
do it .
if you won &apos;t , i will .
all i ever wanted was love .
you told me that was enough for you , but ...
now i realize ...
... nothing ever will be !
zelena !
i owe you thanks for your help .
i have embarked on many a wrongheaded quest in my time .
i &apos;m just glad to finish one that was righteous .
i only wish i knew what happened to emma .
emma did exactly what she needed to .
how do you know ?
i don &apos;t know . i just ...
i do .
what is that ?
it &apos;s the way to move on .
so the defeat of hades was your unfinished business .
perhaps it was yours , too .
come with me .
don &apos;t worry about me .
i &apos;ll be all right .
i was once prophesied to repair a broken kingdom .
my mistake was thinking that kingdom was camelot .
but now i think i understand the kingdom i have to repair ...
is here -- the underworld .
well , i wish you the best .
goodbye , your majesty .
goodbye , captain .
hello , killian .
who are you ?
what do you want ?
i want to thank you .
because of you ,
something very important has been done .
those above have finally destroyed
the misguided god of death --
my brother hades .
zeus .
indeed .
and i &apos;m here to escort you onward .
are you ready ?
i am .
then it &apos;s time to take you where you belong .
i thought you &apos;d like this more than roses .
thanks for the pages .
hades -- he &apos;s -- he &apos;s gone now .
it &apos;s done .
so i hope you &apos;re in a better place .
i know i should be happy about that ...
... but it just feels like now you &apos;re really gone
and there &apos;s nothing left to do but just ...
i miss you .
there , there .
never even got to name his daughter .
there &apos;s only one name i can think of that &apos;s fitting .
robin .
robin .
of course .
i hope we never again have a day like today .
me , too , mom .
i know what you &apos;re thinking ,
and this is not your fault .
i just want to say goodbye alone if that &apos;s okay .
see you at granny &apos;s .
swan ?
killian ?
oh . wh-- how are you here ?
zeus -- he must have sent me back as a reward
for -- for helping defeat hades .
ah ! i mean , what ? !
zeus , you know , the ruler of the olympians ,
the most powerful --
i don &apos;t care . i don &apos;t care how you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m just glad you &apos;re here .
so are you . i &apos;m so happy you &apos;re all right .
not all of us are .
you should have taken my deal .
like i told you ...
this is my kingdom .
