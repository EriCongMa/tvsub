was one of you smoking a cigarette ?
what ?
no .

not me . i have a respiratory problem .
obviously it wasn &apos;t you .

philip ?
haley , keep that ugly sweater on .
anyway , merry christmas !
第一季第十集
no , no , it isn &apos;t that kind of a trial .
it &apos;s just because he says he &apos;s santa claus .
but i &apos;ve got a feeling he is santa claus , mother .
some people don &apos;t believe that . that &apos;s why-
are you crying ?
what are you , a robot ? it &apos;s a deeply emotional movie .
manny , miamor , i need you to help me in the kitchen .
we gotta finish this first , gloria .
the kid &apos;s never seen miracle on 34th street .
that &apos;s because he always
spends christmas in colombia with my family .
and all we see there is salazar and el oso save christmas .
sounds like a classic .
it is .
mom , can we finish the movie ?
okay .
he &apos;s not like anyone else .
he must be santa .
i think perhaps you &apos;re right , susie .
what the hell is that ?
what the hell is that ?
inocente !
what the hell ?
when you told me we were going to watch this movie ,
i got a joke copy from the internet .
you are the inocente !
well , maybe i &apos;m a little confused right now .
what is this &quot; inocente &quot; stuff ?
in colombia , practical jokes are a christmas tradition .
the one that is fooled is the inocente !
we tell practical jokes on april fool &apos;s day ,
so do not do that again .
&quot; inocente . &quot;
does it do it again ? ah , it &apos;s ruined .
are you kidding me with this line ?
i &apos;m gonna ask santa for the last 45 minutes of my life back .
would you cheer up ? we &apos;re in santa &apos;s village with our daughter .
where were we a year ago ?
we were at the beginning of this line .
you know what ? somebody needs to get in the holiday- son of a bitch .
maybe it &apos;s not them .
oh , it &apos;s them .
it &apos;s them .
three years ago , i formed a caroling group .
we were known as the greensleevers .
we would perform at charity events , hospitals-
they were very , very popular .
uh , last year , one of my carolers-
andrew- staged a little coup .
and he , um-
they kicked cameron out of the group .
thank you .
we &apos;re the new greensleevers .
the new greensleevers ?
is there a slap mark on my face ?
i mean , why is edna singing the low harmony ?
it &apos;s like people are applauding out of shock .
let it go .
why would-
okay , next .
ah , finally .
whoa ! i &apos;m- i &apos;m sorry . can i- could you-
what happened to the other santa ?
listen , we &apos;ve been waiting in this line for a really long time ,
and we just want a santa that actually looks like santa .
mitchell , it &apos;s okay .
no , no , no . cam , it &apos;s not okay .
this is lily &apos;s first christmas .
i want to make sure everything is perfect .
we &apos;re gonna wait for the fat santa . all right ?
i knew this would happen .
i @-@ i don &apos;t even know why we hired this guy .
see ? even his elves agree with me . thank you .
i didn &apos;t know christmas made you so petty .
lackluster !
i hate you !
this is unacceptable , and i want to know who did this .
nobody , huh ?
i guess the couch did it to itself .
guess it came home after a tough day ,
lit up a cigarette and then it burned itself .
is that what happened ? because that makes no sense .
if whoever is responsible doesn &apos;t come forward ,
your father and i are just gonna have to punish all three of you .
what ?
that &apos;s not fair !
i can forgive the smoking ,
but i can &apos;t forgive the lie .
no .
or the smoking .
no one wants to confess , huh ? no ?
that &apos;s fine , &apos; cause you know what happens next ?
we cancel christmas !
that &apos;s not fair .
okay , dad , sure .
phil has a habit of making big pronouncements to the kids .
one time i told luke ...
that if he didn &apos;t put his dirty dishes in the dishwasher ,
we would put them in his bed .
phil &apos;s problem is follow @-@ through .
we had no more dishes ,
so we were eating cereal out of the goldfish bowl .
okay . guess where i &apos;m headed ?
to take down the tree . that &apos;s right .
come on , guys .
this is your last chance .
whoever did this , just take responsibility .
don &apos;t put the rest of us through this . luke ? no ?
this is really it . okay ? here we go .
three , two , one .
okay . good @-@ bye , dunphy christmas .
haley , i guess you &apos;re not getting that car .
i was getting a car ?
nope .
i was lying , because that &apos;s what we do now .
dunphys are liars .
when i was in charge , it was all about the music .
i mean , what &apos;s with them tossing out candy canes after every carol ?
it &apos;s pandering .
i think you
made that clear when you tossed them back .
how am i supposed to get all this in the car ?
let me give you a hand with that .
uh , thanks .
thanks . thanks , santa .
can &apos;t call me that anymore .
just got canned .
oh- really ?
guess a couple people complained i wasn &apos;t fat enough .
well , that &apos;s terrible .
that &apos;s what i get for trying not to have a second heart attack .
there you go . always a way to make room .
take it from someone who lives in his car .
oh , well , thank you so much .
no problem . merry christmas .
um , wait , wait . um , please ,
uh , let me give you a little something ...
for your troubles .
no , that &apos;s okay .
gosh . really ? okay .
do you really live in your car ?
yeah . it &apos;s not so bad .
it &apos;s pretty roomy since the wife moved out .
why don &apos;t you come over to our place for dinner tonight ?
seriously ?
yeah . it &apos;s christmas eve .
y @-@ you can &apos;t spend it in your car .
wow , that &apos;s really nice of you guys .
listen , can i bring anything ?
ketchup , soy sauce , straws ?
we &apos;re good .
so , uh , why don &apos;t you follow us to our house ?
okay . in your house .
all right !
cameron .
what ?
okay . tonight , 9 : 00 sharp ,
we open one present each .
pajamas- which we sleep in .
tomorrow morning , 7 : 00 a.m. , manny ,
on the stairs for the christmas picture .
then we open presents .
in colombia ,
they open presents at midnight and stay up till morning .
i &apos;m sure that they do ,
but as you &apos;ll notice from the absence of goats in the street ,
we are not in colombia .
come on ! i &apos;m kidding .
why can &apos;t we mix a couple of colombian traditions in ?
like what ?
like fireworks .
come on . you don &apos;t have fireworks in colombia .
you &apos;re trying to make me the inocente again .
no , we do . at night the sky is beautiful-
very christmassy .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
look , every country has their own traditions .
in our culture , for example ,
the baby jesus is the one ... that brings the gifts ,
not the santa claus .
but that doesn &apos;t make sense .
how could a newborn baby carry all those presents ?
they don &apos;t even know where their hands are .
at least a baby can fit through a chimney .
how would you sit on the baby jesus &apos; lap ?
you &apos;d squish it .
manny , next year we &apos;ll talk about
some of your little colombian traditions .
okay ? maybe .
i know what &quot; maybe &quot; means .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re trying to take away my whole christmas .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s all gone .
dad never follows through .
are you sure one of your friends didn &apos;t burn the couch ?
hey , don &apos;t look at me .
only one of us was ever caught playing with matches .
luke ?
that was a year ago . just admit you did it .
you admit you did it !
no !
okay . look , i have an idea .
do you remember the movie spartacus ?
here &apos;s what we do :
luke , you tell mom and dad it &apos;s your fault .
i didn &apos;t do it .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
because after you confess ,
haley and i will each confess to the same thing .
how does that do anything ?
they &apos;ll be so touched that we &apos;re protecting each other ...
that they &apos;ll have to bring back christmas .
that &apos;s awesome .
how does it work again ?
we &apos;re gonna pass into legend .
the parents who canceled christmas .
i thought you &apos;d be happy .
they &apos;ii write songs about us ,
make one of those christmas specials with those ugly little clay people .
you &apos;re the one who always says
i shouldn &apos;t be such a pushover with the kids .
so this is where you decide to make your stand ?
really , phil ?
okay . okay , look .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;re going to have christmas .
we &apos;ve raised our kids right .
whoever did it will come forward .
or the other two will rat &apos; em out .
mom , dad .
hey , luke . what , uh- what can we do for you ?
i did it .
i was playing with matches . i &apos;m sorry .
you , uh- you did the right thing- yeah .
by confessing , but , um-
this is bad , buddy .
i mean , really bad , okay ?
claire , you want to handle this ?
um , luke , why didn &apos;t you say something ?
mmm , i don &apos;t know .
okay , well , your father and i are extremely disappointed in you ,
so- go up to your room . go on .
alex !
we &apos;ll be up to talk to you in a minute . just go .
haley !
what ?
say something !
about what ?
uh , i take it back !
what is going on ?
these guys were gonna say they did it too ,
and you were gonna be proud of all of us .
why would we do that ?
i don &apos;t know what to believe with this kid .
liars ! i didn &apos;t do it !
well , it wasn &apos;t me .
don &apos;t look at me .
seriously ?
wait .
nobody did it again ?
no , that &apos;s fine .
guess what ? christmas is still canceled .
that &apos;s fine by me .
let &apos;s start working on next year .
hey , and memo to new year &apos;s eve ... and easter-
watch your back !
so , after i left the marines , i just kinda traveled the world .
now i go from town to town picking up odd jobs .
oh . kinda like the hulk .
that &apos;s weird . that was my nickname in the corps-
&apos;cause of my bad temper .
anyway , thanks for having me over ,
having me for dinner , letting me do my laundry .
it &apos;s not been a good day .
um , scott , i @-@ i have a confession to make .
um , i didn &apos;t , uh-
i didn &apos;t clean the lint tray ,
so , um , your clothes might be a little pilly .
oh , no problem . that &apos;s the least of my worries .
thanks for everything . you guys made my day .
it &apos;s the least we could do .
what do you mean ?
i don &apos;t know ... what i was saying .
i just say we never tell him .
exactly .
we give him some money , a hot meal , laundry .
i think we &apos;re square .
agreed . okay , how does this thing work ?
i think you just press that button right there in the middle . yeah .
oh , my
okay . that ...
that seems a little high , doesn &apos;t it ?
yes . i &apos;m not putting lily in that .
it &apos;s like something astronauts train in .
ho , ho , ho ! it &apos;s me ! ho , ho , ho ! it &apos;s me !
it &apos;s your dad .
yeah .
hey , dad .
i brought your presents .
aren &apos;t we seeing you tomorrow , jay ?
these are your christmas eve gifts .
you know the drill .
oh , yeah .
you open those up before bedtime . they &apos;re pajamas .
still keeping traditions alive , huh ?
well , someone has to .
i got two colombians at home
trying to turn christmas into cinco de mayo .
you know that &apos;s mexican , right ?
ah , burrito , &quot; bur @-@ right @-@ o . &quot;
christmas should be christmas .
picture on the stairs , hot chocolate , opening the presents .
that was supposed to be
the good thing about having a kid in the house again .
i can have christmas the way we used to .
i hear you , jay .
if i was home right now ,
i &apos;d be mixin &apos; up a bathtub full of eggnog
and trying to squeeze a greased hog into a santa hat .
you don &apos;t think i miss that ?
do you ?
the point is that those are memories that i &apos;ll always have ,
but now i have the perfect opportunity ...
to create new memories with my new family ...
that are gonna be just as special someday .
aw . no . cam &apos;s right , you know .
we create new traditions every year .
so , who &apos;s ready to try the swing ?
okay , now remind me .
we put this in the oven first thing tomorrow
&apos;cause jay wants to eat at 3 : 00 .
ay , manny ! did you put this spider in the fridge ?
oh , yeah . inocente .
ay , papi , what &apos;s wrong ?
i want to have christmas like they do in colombia .
jay is messing everything up .
manny , try to understand .
jay has great memories with his kids when they were young .
and he just wants to recreate them with you .
so , maybe the best gift i could give jay would be ...
christmas like he used to have it ?
ay , you &apos;re such a beautiful boy !
one day you &apos;re gonna grow up , and i &apos;m gonna miss ...
all the things that you used to do as a little boy .
okay . but if this so @-@ called santa claus ...
doesn &apos;t bring me a burgundy dinner jacket ,
we &apos;re going to have a big problem .
honey ?
would it really be so bad to back down ?
and have the kids never take any of our threats seriously again ?
yeah .
or ... the kids could realize ...
that we &apos;re making a supreme sacrifice by giving up our power
to save their christmas .
which would , in a way , be
the greatest gift that we could ever give them .
and which would paradoxically make them respect us even more .
okay , forget that . go back one .
hey , guys .
it- it was me .
what ?
what ?
i found a cigarette at school ,
and when no one was home , i- i tried it .
and i @-@ i guess i held it too close to the couch .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you can take my christmas away ,
but don &apos;t take it from everyone else .
that is very noble of you to care about the family ,
but you still smoked and lied .
that &apos;s really bad .
now help me grab the tree .
phil .
phil , alex , come on back .
starting december 26 , you are grounded for a full week ,
and that includes new year &apos;s eve .
but , i was
yeah , non @-@ negotiable . so ...
fine .
everybody !
it &apos;s official ! christmas is back on !
it is ?
what happened ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
stockings , lights , ornaments , wreath !
go , go , go !
okay .
well , that sounds like a stressful job to me .
not as much as you &apos;d think .
they always made sure one of us had a blank ,
so nobody knew who took the fatal shot .
this was mighty tasty .
well , i don &apos;t want to overstay my welcome .
you won &apos;t have me back .
you guys enjoy the rest of your night .
you &apos;re good people .
scott . wait , wait .
don &apos;t forget your laundry .
oh ! thanks . thanks , thanks , thanks , thanks .
merry christmas .
scott , merry christmas to you , too .
and happy . son of a bitch .
what ?
oh . it &apos;s the new greensleevers .
they &apos;re cameron &apos;s old caroling group .
they kicked him out this year .
i mean , it is one thing to kick me out of the group ,
but to rub my nose in it !
i &apos;m turning on the sprinklers .
wait . wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
i know it feels good to get even .
believe me .
to see the fear in a man &apos;s eyes is-
but there &apos;s something that feels even better .
forgiveness .
scott , you don &apos;t understand .
this- this group was my dreamgirls .
i was effie .
you know what the best thing i did all day was ?
forgiving you for getting me fired .
andrew .
ensemble .
uh , i know it &apos;s no accident that you &apos;re here on my street tonight .
and i- i just wanted to say to you all that you sound great .
and ... merry christmas .
even your apology is off @-@ key .
not cool , buddy .
well , i should , uh , probably scoot .
but- but- but what about forgiveness ?
you were nice . he was naughty .
where were you for so long ?
just a little last @-@ minute shopping .
what &apos;s this ?
bunuelos .
who ? what ?
cheese fritters .
it &apos;s a colombian traditional christmas food .
okay , new rule : from now on ...
we do colombian things when we &apos;re in colombia .
we do american things when we &apos;re in america .
that means no more of your food ,
no more of your music ...
and especially no more of your crazy holidays !
inocente !
ay , jay !
what ? did i say it wrong ?
you two are total inocentes !
you should see the look on your faces .
and by the way- you know how
hard it is to get fireworks on christmas eve ?
go , manny . thank you .
all righty . here &apos;s another one for luke .
looks like a book .
i have a book already .
what is that ? oh , my god . the couch is smoking .
it &apos;s sunlight .
it &apos;s the ornament .
cool . it &apos;s like a magnifying glass .
hey , how weird is that ? it &apos;s burning a hole ...
in the exact same spot that alex was smoking in .
oh , haley .
alex , why &apos;d you take the blame ?
i didn &apos;t want to lose christmas .
that is so stinking beautiful .
get in here .
no .
yes .
oh , no .
yes .
oh , yes !
bear hug !
wait a- you were going to take
christmas away for something that none of us did ?
well , um , christmas is about moving forward .
i &apos;ve never heard that .
actually , honey , you did kinda shoot your mouth off .
you called us all liars .
yeah , you did , and then ...
let &apos;s not all get worked up . i made a mistake !
i made a mistake . and people make mistakes .
and they make up for those mistakes-
by ... taking their family to italy !
oh , my god ! yeah !
can dylan come ?
yeah ! yeah !
who wants some dark meat ?
we talk a lot about tradition this time of year .
but as much as we love our traditions ,
sometimes our best memories come
from the times that are the most untraditional .
inocente !
we remember the year mom and dad went crazy .
we remember the year santa punched out the caroler .
but for me , this was the year that the word &quot; tradition ... &quot;
got a lot bigger .
there &apos;s cam .
ah , you didn &apos;t .
you got me again .
