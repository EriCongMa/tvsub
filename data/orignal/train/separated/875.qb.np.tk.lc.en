the school play , that time @-@ honored tradition
where a young , budding performer can walk the boards
and feel the hot spotlight on their face .
sure , the sets were flimsy and the costumes cheap ,
but to us , it might as well have been broadway .
and i wanted nothing more than to be a part of it .
&quot; jesus christ superstar &quot; !
the school is literally doing my favorite musical !
it &apos;s fate !
you &apos;re gonna become a musical @-@ theater actor !
that &apos;s every mother &apos;s dream for her son !
this is perfect . i know every part .
the question is , which one do i audition for ?
there is only one role suitable
for my talented , delicious little boy .
my baby ... is jesus .
yeah , that &apos;s a pretty demanding part .
maybe adam would be more comfortable playing something like --
get ! get out of here !
filling his head with doubt and stupid ideas !
i don &apos;t know , mom .
i @-@ it really is a tough part ,
and i &apos;m always in the chorus --
boopie , i &apos;ve heard you sing in the shower , mm @-@ kay ?
not just &quot; heard &quot; -- listened .
not just &quot; listened &quot; -- taped .
and sent to &quot; star search . &quot;
i got to call them back . i haven &apos;t heard from ed mcmahon .
i &apos;ll just drop him a line , see what &apos;s up .
my baby is a star !
who was i to argue with beverly goldberg ?
i took her advice and auditioned for the big &quot; j. &quot;
try not to get worried
try not to turn on to ...
problems that upset you
oh , don &apos;t you know ...
everything &apos;s all right
yes , everything &apos;s fine
we want you to sleep well tonight .
can i start over , please ?
and if you try , we &apos;ll get ...
by so forget all about us ...
tonight
yes , everything &apos;s all right
yes , everything &apos;s all right , yes !
well done , mr. goldberg .
you &apos;ve really improved since last year .
oh , god . the cast list is up .
relax . you always get the lead .
man , how are you so calm ?
eh , miss cinoman kind of implied th i blew her mind -- whatever .
all i know is , there &apos;s a good chance
that i &apos;m gonna be the jesus to your mary .
it was that classic moment we &apos;ve all been through ,
whether it was for sports or theater .
we &apos;ve all stood in front of a list to find out ,
&quot; did i make the cut ? &quot;
you were right ! i &apos;m mary magdalene !
i was praying my name would be
somewhere at the top of the list .
oh , god , no ! not the dreaded second page !
yes , i &apos;m jesus ! son of god , baby !
oh ... that &apos;s great .
um , who did you get , adam ?
uh , i @-@ i &apos;ll be right back .
miss cinoman !
i @-@ i think there &apos;s been some kind of mistake
because i &apos;m pretty familiar with the musical ,
and there is no todd the apostle .
oh , there &apos;s no darnell the apostle , either .
but there was such a large turnout ,
i took the liberty of expanding jesus &apos; followers
from 12 to 30 .
30 ? you can &apos;t fit that many people at the last supper .
oh , yeah , there &apos;s gonna be another , smaller table
off to the side .
i &apos;m at the kids &apos; table at the last supper ? !
i &apos;m sorry .
there was a lot of competition this year .
remember -- there are no small parts , only small actors .
but there are small parts ! very small ! like todd !
do not let your heart be troubled , my child .
trust ... in me .
this putz ? you made this putz jesus ?
unreal !
yep , i was once again shoved into the background .
it was the biggest heartbreak of my young life .
everything &apos;s all right , yes , everything &apos;s fine
boopie ?
i &apos;ve been calling . meatloaf &apos;s ready .
are you crying ?
no .
who hurt you ? tell me and i will hurt them tenfold .
i didn &apos;t get jesus !
i &apos;m a random apostle ,
and i &apos;m so sad &apos; cause i &apos;m not good enough !
i &apos;m gonna ask you a question
that you need to answer with complete honesty .
is there a world in which
you are not the most deserving child for this role ?
there is no such world .
honey , i can get involved .
i want to get involved .
but i need to know that &apos;s what you want .
usually , when my mother wanted to mix in ,
i &apos;d push her away as far as possible .
this was not one of those times .
do it , mama . make me jesus .
it was december 8th , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my dad was driving home from work
and battling his mortal enemy ...
green light , people !
traffic .
green light ! why aren &apos;t you moving ?
son of a -- aaaah !
you &apos;re letting him in ? !
he &apos;s part of a funeral ! that could be a hundred cars !
what kind of crossing guard crosses one kid at a time ? !
you got to group &apos; em and herd &apos; em !
traffic even came before his favorite thing in the world --
hockey ....
best game i &apos;ve ever been to . best game -- hands down .
let &apos;s go , flyers , let &apos;s go !
let &apos;s go , flyers , let &apos;s go !
let &apos;s go , flyers ...
let &apos;s go .
what ? there &apos;s 10 minutes left !
it &apos;s a tie game . we got to stay !
when the game ends , we &apos;ll be stuck in the parking lot
for six hours ! let &apos;s go !
that &apos;s right . no one in our family had ever seen
the end of a game , concert , or show ...
will you just move your leg ? !
... not when my father had traffic to beat .
29 minutes , door @-@ to @-@ door !
a brand @-@ new record !
my god , am i jealous of you two !
ron hextall scores the final goal !
who would &apos;ve figured that ?
hextall ? no , he &apos;s the goalie .
goalies can &apos;t score .
that &apos;s what i thought !
the first time in nhl history , and you guys were there !
he &apos;s wrong . goalies can &apos;t score .
and that &apos;s the replay of the greatest goal in hockey history .
it &apos;s one of those moments that makes you feel
lucky to be alive .
huh . goalies can score .
you !
really ? you &apos;re gonna make a thing out of this ?
you made me miss the greatest moment of my life !
and for what ? traffic ? ! it isn &apos;t that bad !
stop right there ! you should be thanking me .
thanking you ? for what ?
you don &apos;t know the traffic that i &apos;ve seen !
miles of cars lined up for hours , horns blaring !
i know what traffic is !
grown men with their shirts off
walking around &apos; cause it &apos;s so damn hot !
an a.c. &apos; s not meant to run that long . it &apos;s not !
it &apos;s hockey season ! it &apos;s cold outside !
no one gets shirtless !
you want to know something ?
if i could , i &apos;d go back in time and do it all over again .
as a matter of fact , i &apos;d leave earlier !
that &apos;s what you &apos;d do with a time machine ?
you &apos;d go back and miss traffic ?
you wouldn &apos;t help people ? ! save president lincoln ? !
oh , i &apos;d help abe !
i &apos;d go to the theater ,
i &apos;d say , &quot; hey , man , you ought to leave early tonight .
traffic &apos;s horrible ! trust me ! &quot;
boom ! just saved his life !
while my dad was sticking to his guns ,
my mom was in the principal &apos;s office with hers blazing .
she stormed into my drama class ,
ranting at me like a crazy person .
we had to do a 45 @-@ minute massage train
just to calm me down .
well , that &apos;s on you -- i mean , you wouldn &apos;t know a good jesus
if he walked right in here and punched you in the face .
okay .
i &apos;m glad to see that we &apos;re all calm now .
some ... ugly things were said .
and done .
mostly by mrs. goldberg .
look , i am sorry .
adam is very enthusiastic , and he works so hard .
he &apos;s just not as skilled as like , say , dave kim .
if i may , i just have one question .
are you kidding me ?
mrs. goldberg .
out of line !
mrs. goldberg , this is a school . we can &apos;t speak like that .
well , hear this .
my son will be starring in his own school musical .
his what ? what does that even mean ?
&quot; what does that even mean ? &quot; that &apos;s how you sound .
it means adam will be putting on a rival play .
yeah , well -- well , here &apos;s the thing .
this is junior @-@ high theater ,
and we have a budget for one play ,
and even that &apos;s a struggle to fill seats .
tell me something , earl . uh , how &apos;s your wife ?
she &apos;s fine .
lovely woman . pam , is it ?
remind me again how you two got together .
well , you knew her from jazzercize class .
you ... introduced us .
did i , now ?
and how was the wedding ?
you were at the wedding .
you made a speech , even though nobody asked you to .
well , from what i remember ,
that was the night you said , &quot; how can i ever repay you ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; one day , i will come to you ,
and i will ask you for a favor . &quot;
and you said , &quot; but of course , beverly .
but of course . &quot;
that day is today .
what &apos;s going on ?
adam is starring in a rival play .
i &apos;m home !
come on , murray !
a very special &quot; love boat &quot; is almost on !
they &apos;re docking at &quot; fantasy island &quot; !
they &apos;re crossing over !
oh , my god ! that &apos;s unprecedented !
all right .
gimme the remote .
what ? i thought you had it .
i just came in the door ! why would i have a remote ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know . i figured you took it to work .
why would i take the remote to work ?
who the hell knows ? you &apos;re a quirky guy .
fine . i &apos;ll use my hand like an animal .
where &apos;s the knob ? !
do you mean this knob ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
are you missing something historical ?
perhaps a crossover event of
your two favorite shows that you &apos;ll never see ,
and it will haunt you for the rest of your life ?
gimme the knob .
no .
gimme the knob !
no . no .
gimme the knob !
no . no .
gimme the knob ! gimme the knob !
no . no . no .
you took something i love .
now i &apos;m taking something you love .
well , what about me ? i &apos;m just an innocent bystander !
sorry , pops . wrong place , wrong time .
but i got to see this show .
tattoo and gopher in the same room --
how &apos;s that gonna end ?
you are grounded , moron . six months !
fine ! i &apos;m never going to a hockey game with you again .
but you -- you can &apos;t do that . hockey &apos;s our thing .
not anymore .
gimme the knob .
no .
gimme the knob . gimme the knob .
no . no . no .
gimme the knob !
fine !
so , my dad finally got the remote ,
but he lost his favorite thing to do with his son .
forever .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m doing a rival play !
now the question is , what &apos;s our show ?
i @-@ it &apos;s got to be big -- bigger than jesus .
&quot; music man &quot; ?
yawn .
&quot; guys and dolls &quot; ?
seen it .
&quot; phantom &quot; ?
you want to cover half of this face ?
wait !
what ?
it &apos;s so obvious .
who wants to waste their evening
sitting through a silly musical about bible times
when they can go to the future ?
the future .
our musical is going to be
an experience of sight and sound
with actors not in common shoes ,
but roller skates ,
a story not about people --
something bigger .
trains .
trains .
&quot; starlight express &quot; !
l @-@ look at my arm !
goosebumps .
all right ! well , all we need is a cast .
actually , i know a mighty talented girl named dana
who &apos;d follow me to the ends of the earth .
uh , no .
we need to keep looking .
well , we don &apos;t have a lot of options
when it comes to leading ladies .
i suppose i could maybe be the one to --
you cannot .
this is a show for children .
got it .
well , if it can &apos;t be me ...
and i think we &apos;ve ... ruled that out .
we have .
right .
how about the closest thing to me ?
hello , daughter . have a seat .
i just happened to be digging around in your closet ,
and guess what i found .
three beers , a fake i.d. ,
and sick notes for school that i don &apos;t remember writing .
there is a simple explanation for all of that .
i just need half an hour to collect my thoughts .
perhaps there &apos;s a world where i could overlook all this .
really ?
i can give you a pass this time .
just know that one day ,
i will come to you and ask you for a favor .
yeah , great . that &apos;s totally fair .
and that day is right now .
while my mom was forcing erica to do the musical ,
my dad had forced pops to replace barry .
you &apos;re crowding me . come on , man .
your -- your jacket &apos;s puffing into my side .
so what ? it &apos;s cold as hell in here .
you think you can get them to turn the heat on ?
no !
there &apos;s a huge block of ice out there !
what &apos;s that terrible smell ?
w @-@ what are you eating ?
i made myself a whitefish @-@ salad sandwich .
well , it &apos;s wafting !
barry and i get hot dogs because they don &apos;t waft !
you know , i don &apos;t think this is about the whitefish
or this giant thermos of borscht i &apos;m about to open .
i think this ... is about barry .
oh , please . it is not .
it &apos;s obvious you want to be here with him .
well , i @-@ i do miss the moron a little .
hockey was our thing .
then just sit in traffic already . it &apos;s that simple .
traffic is non @-@ negotiable .
murray , sometimes you have to do things you hate
for the people that you love .
like how i &apos;m here with you now .
as much as my dad hated the sweet stink of borscht ...
oh , that smell .
... he was still too stubborn to give in .
welcome to the first rehearsal of the disco @-@ pop masterpiece
&quot; starlight express . &quot;
as you know , i &apos;m adam goldberg ,
your director and leading man .
and now please welcome my choreographer / assistant / mom ,
beverly goldberg .
now , i need you all to pay real close attention ,
&apos;cause i only want to do this once , okay ?
it &apos;s like i want to scream and run ,
but i also want to see what happens next .
five , six , seven , eight !
&quot; starlight express &quot; !
&quot; starlight express &quot; !
the name of the show is &quot; starlight express . &quot;
smoking car . smoking car .
dining car ! dining car !
sleeping car . sleeping car .
i think i can ! i think i can ! i think i can !
smile !
chug @-@ a @-@ chug @-@ a @-@ chug @-@ a @-@ chug @-@ a ...
there &apos;s a hobo on the train .
what fun . thank you .
all right . everybody got it ?
let &apos;s see it !
five , six , seven , eight !
&quot; starlight express &quot; ! &quot; starlight express &quot; !
ah , i like how some of you are going forwards
and some of you are going sideways .
train hands .
&quot; starlight express &quot; !
&quot; starlight express . &quot;
wow . you seriously think this is worth it ?
thank you for this wonderful gift , mama .
sure , it was a train wreck , but she had my undying love .
it &apos;s totally worth it .
the opening night of &quot; starlight express &quot;
was quickly approaching , and i was melting down
&apos;cause our show was going off the rails .
three , four , five , six , seven , eight !
join on ! get there ! get there !
what ?
are you kidding me right now ?
you &apos;re going too fast , and i couldn &apos;t hook in .
and i &apos;m fine . thanks .
uh , i @-@ i think we need to take five .
do you think &quot; superstar &quot; is taking five ?
no ! they sold out !
and how many tickets have we sold , tyler ?
seven .
seven tickets ! and do you know why ?
it &apos;s because some of you , who shall remain nameless ,
have no talent .
sanjeev , darlene , ethel , skinny david , other david .
you know what , adam ?
i &apos;m not taking five . i &apos;m quitting .
fine ! quit ! we don &apos;t need you !
aw , wait !
she &apos;s the caboose ! mom , stop her !
&apos;sup ?
i haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
i know you &apos;ve been super busy , but i miss you .
maybe later we could grab a bite ?
who sent you ?
what ?
was it miss cinoman ?
&apos;cause this has her cinoman @-@ y stink all over it .
i &apos;m not spying on you , adam .
that &apos;s exactly what a spy would say .
oh , whatever . i &apos;m gonna go .
honey , you need to go apologize .
i have to apologize ? have you seen your choreography ?
back to one , people !
in that moment , my mom realized
she didn &apos;t make her little boy a star .
she made him a monster .
meanwhile , my dad was still being monstrously stubborn .
out of options , he brought his favorite employee , vic ,
to the next game .
whoa . right on the glass .
best seats for my best pal .
hey , not bad . thank you .
please stand
for the canadian national anthem .
oh , canada
my home and native land
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m singing the song of my country .
what country ?
canada . i &apos;m from edmonton .
i &apos;ve told you -- oh , forget it .
oh , canada
we stand on guard for thee
as 10,000 people booed my father ,
he officially realized how much he missed barry .
what are you doing ? !
back at home , my mom missed the days
when i was happy just to be a schmo in the chorus .
sorry i quit the play .
but in my defense ...
it &apos;s a turd on wheels .
oh , it really is .
how did my sweet , little boy turn into such a monster ?
you shifted the world so it entirely revolves around him .
of course ! it &apos;s what i do !
but usually someone steps in and stops me .
look , i know adam &apos;s your little superstar ,
but there &apos;s a reason he &apos;s always in the chorus .
well , i can &apos;t tell him that .
it would shatter his precious heart .
lucky for you , i can .
hey , buddy .
mom needs to tell you something about the show .
she thinks it sucks .
what ?
don &apos;t get her wrong ,
she thinks you &apos;re the most talented , delicious boy
in the whole world , who deserves to be the star .
but no one else does .
mom ? i @-@ is this true ?
honey , i , uh ...
i think we both got a little bit carried away .
maybe a little .
i know how much you want this , and i want this for you ...
but sometimes ...
you just got to be todd the apostle .
hearing that , coming from the woman who loved me too much ,
&quot; put a little love in your heart &quot;
meant that it was time for me to hang up my skates .
it &apos;s probably for the best .
dana &apos;s not talking to me ,
and sanjeev did break his collarbone .
but thanks for always believing in me , mama .
even when you probably shouldn &apos;t .
i &apos;ll never stop .
busy .
too busy ...
for the greatest rivalry in the history of hockey ?
the flyers @-@ rangers game ? no way !
still not interested .
what if we stay till the end ?
and get stuck in traffic ?
why would you ever do that ?
i miss you .
say it again .
no .
you love me more than you hate traffic -- say it !
you &apos;re a moron .
say the words .
no .
say the words .
no . no .
say the words .
no . no .
say the words .
no . no .
say the words .
my dad never said the words ,
but barry knew he meant them when he heard the final buzzer .
it wasn &apos;t a historical hockey moment ,
but it was a historical night for the goldbergs --
the first time any of us saw the end of a game .
and , sure , they got stuck in traffic for two hours
and complained the whole time ...
whoa , what -- what is she doing ?
... but my dad didn &apos;t care
&apos;cause it meant being stuck for two hours with his kid .
and turns out , miss cinoman was right --
there are no small roles , only small actors .
i was the greatest 30th apostle at the kids &apos; table
the world had ever seen ...
i love you , todd the apostle !
... and it felt great .
can it be what it seems
there will be no more love
there will be no more dreams
come on !
green light , people ! green light !
one car went through ! one car !
move it , lady !
what are you , sally field ?
put your makeup on at home !
oh , there &apos;s a baby on board ? !
i &apos;ll tell you what , there &apos;s a moron on board !
moron !
son of a --
car full of morons !
