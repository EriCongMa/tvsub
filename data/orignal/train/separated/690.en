My father was an innocent man,
destroyed by powerful people.
The Graysons are behind this, and they're gonna pay.
I've dedicated my life to avenging his death...
Eventually, someone's gonna find you out.
And I won't stop
until they've all paid the price.
He showed up the night of Conrad's election.
I had no doubt that he was my firstborn.
Margaux Lemarchal.
Pascal Lemarchal's daughter.
I'm a fan of all of his publications,
Especially "Voulez."
That's why I've moved here--
To start the American version.
You have Huntington's disease, governor.
You're responsible for what happened to conrad today, aren't you?
I will let them suffer.
These are terrible people doing terrible things.
Finish this, then leave for good,
Or I'll tell everyone the truth.
Let's get married before the end of the summer.
What are you doing here?
Same thing as you--
Looking to destroy the girl next door.
It is believed that original sin
can only be cleansed by the waters of baptism.
But it is the sins that follow
that are not so easily washed away.
And since forgiveness of trespass
is only granted to the truly penitent,
pure evil can never be erased.
We're miles away from prying eyes.
I think we can proceed.
Proceed with exactly what, Mr. Mathis?
Three days ago, you re-emerge,
claiming a vendetta against Emily Thorne.
I don't usually trust people who tell me
exactly what I want to hear.
You're not the only one who wants Emily to suffer.
Well, that's rather extreme, considering the two of you had
what amounted to a summer fling.
Our history predates the Hamptons.
There's a great deal about that girl you don't know.
So now we get to the heart of the matter--
You're in love with her.
She betrayed me in a way you couldn't even imagine.
Or maybe you can...
as I'm sure David Clarke's treachery lit a fire inside you.
Do not make inferences to my past,
nor try to compel me by straining to link David
with whatever Emily is up to.
Don't be so sure.
Once upon a time...
David Clarke attempted to destroy your livelihood.
and now you've lost it
at the hands of Emily and Nolan Ross.
Neither one of them has a monetary concern in the world.
A scammer like Emily has, uh, other motives.
Why should I believe you?
Because I did it with them.
But the moment they got what they wanted,
I was summarily cast out.
So I want Emily to feel that same kind of betrayal,
which means only one thing-- teaming up with you.
We can make her pay, Victoria.
But you're gonna have to trust me.
Trust is difficult without proof.
Well, then you'll have it.
Is the "Voulez"?
Wow. Margaux must have made quite the impression
to get you to read what you called,
"A rag about nothing but dresses and hair."
I shouldn't have judged this magazine by its cover.
You know, it turns out they have
some significant political and cultural pieces, too.
Why the sudden interest?
Well, you know, instead of going crazy
waiting around for my Huntington's test results,
I'm grabbing the taureau by the horns
and having dinner with Margaux at Muse tonight.
I want to help her run "Voulez."
You really think you could do this?
Well, I've always dreamt of having a job
where I could be more creative.
I just have to bone up on piping and scoop necks.
Unless, of course, my fashion-fluent
fianceé was by my side.
Of course.
I'll call Muse and make it dinner for three.
You're perfect.
That's it.
Three days of moping in the dark is the legal limit.
I am not moping.
I am avoiding the telephoto lenses
trying to document how they think the mighty have fallen,
which I most certainly have not.
Booze in the morning looks a lot like denial, dad.
So does moving out at your father's expense.
Look, you're here every day,
so why not just save yourself the commute
from your friends' couches?
Well, first of all, they have guest houses.
And I might have to move back
just to keep a drink out of your hand.
I'm getting you through this, whether you want me to or not.
You know, I may have used up all my good luck on you...
and it was worth it.
Tell my driver where,
and he'll be happy to provide you with your drive of shame, or...
fame.
Bye....
You.
Not even learning names now?
Less mess.
Especially after my P.T.S.D.--
Padma, Tyler, sexual damage.
Just be careful who you let come and go.
Until I find Daniel a job in the city...
I need to be able to trust you with this.
I had a feeling you'd be uncapping
that red sharpie now that Jack set a deadline.
So... who's next to get got with red on their face?
Paul Whitley.
He was in charge of enticing investors to Grayson Global.
My father saw him holding closed-door meetings with everyone who eventually betrayed him.
So Conrad used Paul's silver tongue
to sway the undecided?
I always wondered how so many people
turned against a man as good as your dad.
Now you have your answer.
And I have my next challenge.
Why?
Is he... some untouchable C.E.O.?
He works for an even higher power.
Father Paul?
You must be Emily.
So nice to finally put a face to a name.
I could say the same.
This is my fiancé Daniel Grayson.
Conrad and Victoria's son?
Yeah.
I used to work for your father a long time ago.
At Grayson Global?
Mm.
Wow, what a coincidence.
I don't believe much in coincidence.
Couldn't agree more, Father.
Then I did some missionary work overseas
before being assigned to St. Francis.
That's quite a radical shift from the corporate life.
Why did you do it?
Well, I was there for the David Clarke scandal.
And when he died in prison,
it really hit me what greed can do to a soul.
So I looked out my office window and all the way uptown,
and I knew that there were millions of souls
on the street, tormented, that I could help
in ways that I hadn't helped him.
So I quit Grayson Global, joined the seminary,
And ten years later, here we are.
I'm sorry. I heard about your father's Huntington's diagnosis.
How are your parents holding up?
Well, as good as could be expected, I guess.
I take it you're not in touch with them anymore.
They weren't exactly happy with my exit from the firm.
Well, since you're officiating,
maybe this was meant to be.
Hey, Father, do you-- do you mind?
Oh, go ahead.
T-try her out, take her out for a test drive,
see how she feels.
My gut tells me you aren't the girl
that dreamt of a big church wedding.
Yeah, I guess I just...
always imagined something much simpler.
The Graysons do pull you into their world, don't they?
Something like that.
Imagine the look on his face when he sees you come down this aisle.
It'll be a dream come true.
So what do you think?
People gonna miss the salisbury steak?
As someone who's had it, no.
Hey, Charlotte.
That's "Aunt" Charlotte. Can you say that?
I didn't know you were coming by.
I'm just making my rounds.
I check in on dad to lift his spirits,
and then lift mine with this cute face.
Oh, Carl.
Calms him down every time.
Amanda was beautiful.
And there's Declan.
I keep thinking back to the last time I spoke to him.
It's okay, Charlotte.
I still can't believe they're gone.
And now dad's dying.
How can such bad things happen to good people?
Mr. Grayson, please.
Come on in.
Paul.
It's been a long time, Victoria.
I was under the impression
that I had laid eyes on you for the last time years ago.
Trust me, I had no intention of ever seeing you or Conrad again.
The lord works in mysterious ways.
You don't know?
Daniel and Emily have asked me to preside over their wedding.
Tell me you're not considering it.
I feel it's the right thing to do.
It's the reason I'm here.
Why?
To shame us over events best relegated to history?
To help put them to rest.
Well, while I appreciate your arrogance,
I'm doing just fine, thank you.
I wish I could say the same for Conrad.
Well, you're welcome to take a run at him.
But he's always viewed god as a competitor.
Hey, boss.
Well, I haven't been your boss since you quit
sometime last century.
Unless, of course, you weren't talking to me,
in which case, you should be aware
that he is not here.
No, I'm here to see you, Conrad.
And I think you may need me.
Oh, please, do spare me the pious priest act.
The paul I knew could sell ice to an Eskimo
and not be afraid to get his hands filthy in the doing of it.
I'm the same guy.
Just selling something of higher value.
Selling?
Oh, god, of course, that's why you're here.
Look, I think you have been
more than adequately compensated for your silence.
You don't need to remind me
of something that still torments me.
Well, I could have tried to tell you
that collar wasn't gonna do you any good.
And I'm glad I didn't listen.
Well...
Hey, whatever you need to sleep at night,
but, you know, don't forget that unlike your flock,
I know firsthand that that soul of yours
is... far from unblemished.
I asked for forgiveness. I found peace in my penance.
And I'm here to suggest that your Huntington's
is the Lord's way of forcing you to do the same--
to atone for your sins.
Look, I will not impute to genetic anomaly
with the acts of a vengeful deity.
This is a matter of science, not religion, Father.
You can believe me or not.
But I've seen a lot of people suffer.
And when they do, it causes them...
to look at who they'll be when they die.
The act of acknowledging your sins is terrifying.
But I've learned that it's better to be
honestly unhappy than dishonestly so.
Well...
Then you know what? I'd like to confess
that I am honestly unhappy that you're here.
Okay.
You can make fun.
But times like these require support.
And something tells me you're alone in this room
because you may not have it.
We may no longer see eye-to-eye,
but I'll always be here for you.
So you can imagine my shock when a man parachutes
into the first party I attend here.
Nolan Ross does know how to get attention.
Mm, and for good reason. He's brilliant.
Unpredictable.
On the cutting edge of fashion.
Now you ask me,
Ross is what led to my father's collapse.
Well, then maybe we should ship him off
to meet mine.
Well, at least your father gave you permission
to bring "Voulez" to the States.
The name is the extent of Pascal's generosity.
If papa had his way, his only daughter
would join the board of a charity and get married.
It's not so bad, really.
Oh, my goodness. No, no, no.
I-I meant nothing by that. No, no, I'm sorry. Oh, no.
No, I think I'm just preoccupied with matters at hand--
finding reliable advertisers...
and investors with deep pockets.
Or you could just hire someone to do that for you.
With my business experience,
we can make a good run at this.
My father attributes two of his divorces
to the demands of "Voulez."
I, of course, attribute it to my father.
But I couldn't live with myself
if I took away your first years of marriage.
I couldn't live with myself
if I prevented him from pursuing a dream.
Why don't I leave you two to talk?
Excuse me.
Charlotte?
Nice to see you here.
I came here to surprise Daniel and Margaux,
but you know what they say-- "Four's a crowd."
Is something wrong?
You were the only person I told
about my mother's supposed affair.
Next thing I know,
it's gotten back to her through Ashley.
I didn't say a word.
Ashley must have found out some other way.
I mean, you know how nosy she is.
You know, I used to defend you when my mother would
go on one of her Emily rants,
But now I think I'll stay quiet.
Charlotte, I understand that you're upset,
but I didn't do it.
And anyway, it's just a little bit of gossip.
A little bit of gossip?
Maybe you don't get that even one tiny lie
can cause a lot of damage.
Charlotte, please.
You were one of the few people left in my life
I felt connected to.
And now I don't know if I can trust you anymore.
So thanks for the concern,
but no, thanks.
Hey, perfect timing, Ems.
I picked up a new hobby working in the prison kitchen.
See, it turns out that, uh, blueberry muffins
can calm even the most sociopathic heart.
I should have one.
First I lose Jack for telling the truth,
then I lose Charlotte for lying.
Then take a breather.
Especially since the guy on deck is not only a priest,
but practically the Mother Teresa of the Bronx.
Got a library card in lieu of Wi-Fi.
Every other takedown
had histories that read like rap sheets, but...
all signs point to Paul being a good man.
Well, my father was a better man.
Right. The gospel according to Emily--
Sin unto others as you've had sinned unto you.
Right.
This time, I just--
I kinda think you're going too far.
If--if you cannot forgive Paul,
how do you expect to be forgiven?
I don't.
Look, I have two months before the wedding,
which means I'm not pulling any punches.
Just check your soul, Emily Thorne,
'cause once you start taking down kittens,
I'm out.
Unhand my painting this instant.
Uh, pay no mind to the lady of the house, gentlemen.
As you were.
What do you think you're doing?
I was under the impression that you had
at least a few more months before dementia kicked in.
Charming.
Maintaining stables,
standing suites at the south fork,
and our yacht you've suddenly grown fond of again,
actually costs money.
Auctioning off one of the pieces
from your collection this afternoon
will keep us afloat... for June.
Oh, and when, pray tell,
will you be sacrificing your ferrari?
We can discuss that in July. Unless, of course,
you've suddenly found our stolen millions?
July it is.
Miss Thorne.
I decided to do some baking.
I thought I'd... share.
They're blueberry.
That's my favorite. How considerate...
and ironic that my wife is
the only woman in this family who doesn't care about me.
Excuse me.
Well, I met your officiant today,
or I should say "re-met."
I really wish that you would clear such things with me.
Oh, forgive me, Victoria, but when I heard that
you and Father Paul had a history,
I saw an opportunity to mend another fence.
Another?
Well, like Patrick.
I imagine you want him to be a part of our perfect day.
Oh, you're kind to pour sugar on that wound,
but I prefer to keep him separate.
Oh, well, I suppose Patrick's used to it.
That is a shame, though. I've never seen you so happy.
But considering your family's current state,
I understand. Who knows how they'd react?
Well, you're busy. I should go.
Put that painting back.
I have another piece in mind.
They like you.
You know, this is
where Sammy came running up to you a couple years ago.
Sometimes I wonder
what would have happened if I hadn't brought him to the park that day.
I understand how you feel, Jack.
Do you?
'Cause it keeps changing for me...
every time Charlotte comes by.
I hate myself for going along with this.
That's actually why I stopped
when I saw you. I...
I'm worried about her.
Well, so am I, but what can I do?
You're the source of most of her pain.
Unless you're here to give me permission
to tell her the truth.
I can't do that, Jack.
Not before the end of the summer, right?
She won't talk to me,
but I know something's not right.
I was just hoping that maybe you would speak with her.
You really refuse to accept responsibility, don't you?
She's your sister.
Tell me, when exactly did punishing the guilty
become more important to you than helping the innocent?
I gotta tell ya,
I was shocked to hear that Fontana's "Monsoon No.2"
was on the block.
Patrick.
Now why are you offering this up to these vultures, huh?
I mean, you love this piece.
Yes, I do.
But the truth is we're, um...
we're having financial troubles.
And now that Conrad's had to step down from office...
Why didn't you say something?
You're going to think me shallow,
but the world I live in,
if they sense this vulnerability,
they will use it as a weapon.
So... I part with the things I love.
Still not an easy sacrifice to make, right?
It's easier than some others.
Well, quite frankly,
the final chance to see this piece
is not why I came by.
Well, that's why I chose the Fontana--
because I knew you'd come.
Never doubt those instincts of yours.
You know, they're always spot on.
I know that my daughter came to see you,
and it says a lot about her.
and it says a lot about you for protecting her.
It's okay.
Family's complicated.
But my feelings for you are simple.
And I am never going to
let another day pass without you in it.
This is Father Paul.
Father, I need your help.
I don't know what to do.
Hello?
Father Paul Whitley.
Are you here?
A pleasure to finally meet you, Ms. Lemarchal.
Oh, all mine, Mr. Johnson.
Richard, please.
Bonsoir, mademoiselle.
Et monsieur.
Thanks, Richard. Appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, first you find me enough investors
that I can actually afford a nice office space.
Then get the man who made "Page Six"
interested in working with us...
in the course of one day.
So when do I start?
I don't remember offering you the job.
Oh, but you were about to.
What's the reason we're not staying in these offices?
My father's name is on the building.
And he made it clear my presence here is temporary.
Too bad. I could get used to a view like this.
This calls for celebration.
I can't.
I've been summoned to Southampton tonight.
Hmm. You still have a little time.
Come to borrow a cup of vinegar?
No, I wanted to drop these off
and welcome you to the neighborhood.
We didn't get a chance to talk the other day
after that little stunt of yours.
Well, I couldn't wait to be surrounded by
nothing but air after having been locked up
for six months.
And after your recent legal issues,
how fortunate you were able to purchase this place.
I know how long it takes to thaw frozen assets.
In fact, I'm certain someone with your technological prowess
would have no trouble accessing bank accounts,
whether they belong to you or not.
Although I love a good shower of praise,
Victoria, I don't know if you've noticed.
But, uh, my life is a computer-free zone these days.
Oh, I see you've made room for other things.
Now what could have made you part with such a masterpiece?
And who knew you to be such an art connoisseur?
Well, I... dabble.
In many things, no doubt.
Some, quite possibly, unforgivable.
I should leave you to get settled.
Charlotte.
I'm glad you're here.
Listen, I'm sorry for what happened yesterday.
It's fine. Let's just enjoy dinner, shall we?
Your meetings must have went well.
Yeah.
I waited for you at the house, but I didn't want to be late.
Well, you know what the traffic's like
getting out of the city.
So... was Margaux interested?
She made an offer. I told her I'd sleep on it.
A job with a monthly publication?
I thought you'd want a little stability.
Just worry about yourself right now, okay?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Echoing the universal sentiment
that Huntington's should occupy 100% of my thoughts.
Or maybe it's just that it's everyone's eloquent way
of not having to heed my opinions.
Well, I'd like to know how you're feeling, dad.
Pretty much the same, sweetheart. Thank you.
Any idea why your mother
has called this de facto family summit?
To introduce you to someone special.
Who's this?
Our brother.
I gotta say I do miss the fountain in the stairwell.
Oh, wow. Well-versed in modernists
and well-acquainted with my home.
You are just full of surprises, Mr. Osbourne.
He was living here.
Of course he was.
So no job?
Well, Patrick is a freelance artist.
Oh, freelancing's not a profession, dear.
It's a hobby one has between bartending shifts.
And I could use another drink.
You've had enough.
I'll get it.
You know, after "Nightline," letters poured in from leeches
claiming to be her son.
How do we know you're not one of them?
I have the, uh...
I could have swor-- you know what I did?
I left the D.N.A. Test in my other jacket.
He's funny. Well...
Don't think you've hit the jackpot, buddy,
'cause we're broke.
Patrick is apprised of our situation.
And as difficult as it may be for any of you to believe,
there's some people driven by motivations other than financial gain.
You know, perhaps Patrick can float us a loan
from what's left of the $5 million.
I mean, that is how you sustain a life.
Thank you, uh, freelancing, I imagine.
What are you talking about?
When Patrick here was of age,
he came and searched for his mother.
And our general factotum, frank, paid him that tidy sum
to... disappear.
The guy's name was Frank?
Well, Frank showed up...
But he only threatened to hurt me.
I never saw a cent of that money.
And no offense, Mr. Grayson,
but my only fear coming into tonight was that
you'd try to sic him on me again.
Then I have two happy pieces of news to share.
First off, poor Frank is deceased.
And I wasn't the one who sent him.
That'd be your dear old mum.
You did that?
It's true.
Excuse me.
No! Wait.
When you came looking for me,
I suddenly became that scared teenage girl again.
And I made the same mistake.
And I've only just begun
to make up for what I've been missing.
And I swear to you that I will go to my grave
to try to atone for those sins.
Now...
Patrick has done nothing wrong.
And for you to treat him like this
is not only unwarranted. It is unacceptable.
He is good, and he is genuine.
And I will be damned if I sit here
and let you drag him down to your level.
He is my son, and that makes him family.
Well, then, here's...
Conrad, are you all right?
Aah! Damn it!
Look what you've done, mother.
God, how can you be so selfish?
Springing Patrick on us and riling dad up.
He's sick, and you could care less.
Charlotte--
Patrick, if I were you, I'd get out before it's too late.
I still can't believe my mother chose
to trot Patrick out yesterday.
Well, I'm sure she had her reasons.
Why do I even care?
My parents are rotten human beings
who continually disappoint me.
And yet I have this innate need to protect them.
Because despite everything, they're your family.
And when someone comes along and threatens that bond,
You'll do anything to defend it.
Is that why you haven't mentioned the job--
Because it's in the city?
The job?
You should take it, Daniel.
I'll be here to make sure that Patrick doesn't interfere too much,
and besides, I'm sure Margaux is counting on you.
She can handle herself, believe me.
I'm just--I'm just not sure it's for me.
Well, I'll leave it up to you,
but just consider it, okay?
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Morning, Patrick.
Emily. What are you doing here?
Well, I had a meeting with my wedding planner,
and she canceled last minute.
Then I remembered that you were staying here.
I know that if I were you,
I'd want to talk to somebody after last night.
The Graysons can be quite a handful.
I'm well aware of your history with my mother and her family. So...
I can handle myself.
Please... hey! Carl.
Hey! Carl! Hey.
It looks like someone's in a mood.
He's been fussy all afternoon.
I tried to feed him, I gave him a toy,
I even tried the wedding video.
Come here, come here.
Nothing I did was good enough.
Oh, buddy.
He's just tired. He's just tired.
Yeah, tired of his auntie.
Clearly I'm not fit for motherhood.
What?
You're being too hard on yourself.
No, I'm not.
You don't know what I've done, and I can't help but thinking
it's the universe's way of paying me back.
What are you talking about?
If I had just told Declan where I was instead of lying,
he wouldn't have come looking for me at Grayson Global.
His death is all my fault.
Charlotte...
You've been blaming yourself this whole time?
It's nothing to do with--
Jack, don't.
I don't deserve your pity.
I'm the reason your brother's gone.
Charlotte, wait.
There's something you need to know.
So your instincts about turning Patrick
were a little off.
Kinda makes you want to reconsider
taking down father Paul, doesn't it?
Tell me you didn't call me here
to talk me out of it.
Just finishing a little home improvement project.
Nice, Nolan.
And... that's not all.
What are you doing?
"All I ask is that you promise to do
"the one thing that I was never able to do."
Nolan.
"Forgive.
"Keeping hate for the people who betrayed me
"has brought nothing but torment and heartache.
You deserve better than that, Amanda. You deserve love."
Don't you ever go through my things again.
Do you understand me?
I brought you into this
because I thought you loved my father.
I do love him, and I love his daughter.
And I want to protect her.
I don't need your protection, Nolan.
Wha--circumstances change, Ems.
You probably didn't think
you were gonna tell Jack the truth...
until this was all over. But look what happened.
So maybe--maybe the best-laid plans
are sometimes meant to be abandoned!
Maybe they're meant to be carried out alone.
Oh, there's my girl.
I am not your girl.
You know, despite all the horrible things
I heard about flight 197
and what you did to my actual father,
I hoped it wasn't true, that you couldn't be that evil.
Uh, what are you saying?
You knew about the bomb that killed Declan.
Who told you that?
Do you have any idea how guilty I feel over his death?
From the moment it happened, I blamed myself.
It made me sick, and I know that's why I miscarried.
Oh, Charlotte, sweetheart, that--
You watched me suffer,
while you sat on your throne in the governor's mansion.
I'm done helping you.
Please, don't do this.
You deserve to die miserable and alone.
"Our father, who art in heaven,
"hallowed be thy name.
"They kingdom come, thy will be done,
"On earth as it is in heaven.
"Give us this day our daily bread,
"And forgive us our trespasses
"As we forgive those who trespass against us.
"And lead us not into temptation,
"But deliver us from evil.
"For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory,
forever. Amen."
Amen.
Amen.
And the next thing I know,
someone cracked me over the head.
And I wake up an hour later with an empty wallet
and a killer headache.
That's terrible. What did the police say?
Oh, I didn't call them.
Whoever did it needed what I had more than I did.
Let's talk about your wedding.
Well, I...
I hear you saw my future in-laws.
I did... until Conrad practically threw me out.
I only hope he heard a little of what I had to say.
I don't understand. Why wouldn't he?
In truth,
the mistakes that we made-- in large part--
are why I changed my life
and try to change those of others.
Hopefully, I'll make a better impression
on your parents, Emily.
I lost my parents when I was young.
I'm sorry. It must be difficult planning a wedding
knowing that your father won't be there
to walk you down the aisle.
Yeah.
If he were still here,
I know that he would be proud of the woman that you've become,
and getting all the happiness
that he must have wanted for you.
I'm sorry, father.
Well, it's-- it's all right.
When one loses a parent at a young age,
they miss out on a whole lifetime of unconditional love.
Lucky for you,
I know where you can find a little extra.
Hey.
Daniel.
Look, uh, about yesterday...
I'm sorry.
Obviously, I was mistaken.
The old Daniel wouldn't have hesitated.
Now the new Daniel picks up my dress and hands it to me.
That's a first.
And I assume he also has the class
to decline a job in person?
Let me choose the "Voulez" office location,
and I'll take the job.
That's it?
That's it.
Well, you'd be doing me a favor.
Where do you have in mind?
Montauk.
You want to make a splash, we gotta be trailblazers.
Plus I have some holdings there
completely rent-free and ready for rehab.
And it allows you to be close to your fiancee?
It does let me be nearer to my family, yeah.
And all the power players we want relationships with--
that's where they summer, too.
This new Daniel Grayson drives a hard bargain.
Exactly what I'm looking for in a publisher.
I started collecting food for the homeless on holidays...
when I first came to the parish, but...
Father Paul.
Hey!
Now it's just grown exponentially.
I'm hoping when I become pastor,
I'll find a bigger place, feed more people.
Oh, Christina!
Oh, my goodness.
Here you go.
Thanks.
So cool!
Overwhelming, isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
Thank you, Father.
Excuse me. There's something I have to go do.
Pastor, how are you?
Not good, Paul. We need to talk.
I don't understand. This makes no sense.
Aiden?
Checking up on my story about Nolan Ross, were you?
Don't go behind my back.
I won't have you jeopardize my plans.
Until you earn my trust, Mr. Mathis,
I will take matters into my own hands.
As I suspected,
Nolan is clearly hidding somethig.
He's merely a paw...
lile I was.
The deed... to Nolan's house...
with Emily's name on it.
She has your fortune.
What now?
Now you do something for me.
I'm sorry, dad.
Conrad?
Emily?
I guess it's true what they say,
bride's work is never done.
I haven't been in a sanctuary like this since...
I was an altar boy.
Are you here to see Father Paul?
No, no. Why do you ask?
He and I got off on the wrong foot yesterday.
I got off the wrong foot yesterday, with him, with Patrick...
others I care about.
Is he in his office?
I'm afraid he is gone.
There was an incident.
He left St. Francis.
I've always deemed karma a concept created
to lift the spirits of the unaccomplished,
but recent events have given me pause.
I've always believed in the natural balance of things.
We reap what we sow.
Then harvest may be upon me, Miss Thorne.
It's time for me to face the punishment for my sins.
I'm sorry. Please excuse my senseless prattle.
I should have accepted Paul's ear when I had the chance.
Isn't there anyone else you could talk to?
I fear I have no one left to listen.
I suppose I should take that, too, as a sign.
Good night, Emily.
Come for this?
No.
You were right.
I knew you hadn't gone full dark side. So...
you stopped the takedown?
I tried. It was too late.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Fix it.
Because I think Father Paul can do the one thing
I haven't be able to.
Convince Conrad to confess...
to everything.
