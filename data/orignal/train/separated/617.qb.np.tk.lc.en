it wasn &apos;t meant to be this way . you know ?
we make our plans , sure .
but life ...
life is what happens to you along the way .
you know , at first , i didn &apos;t want this .
i didn &apos;t want to connect .
i didn &apos;t want to get involved .
and she kept on at me .
&quot; this is what life is . this is why we &apos;re here ,
to connect .
to build . &quot;
we &apos;re here to build something .
and then we had theo .
and then i understood that she was right .
we &apos;re not meant to be alone .
you know what she said to me ?
she said that even the most damaged heart
can be mended .
even the most damaged heart .
no , i &apos;m with vic .
what ?
i can &apos;t let you in until alphonse is home .
alphonse is on his way .
where ?
in the basement .
paulie .
no .
it &apos;s paul .
¿ por qué no alarma esta pecada ?
yo que dije que siempre la tengas puesta .
élla dice que no la pagó .
go .
&quot; 719 , now you realize . &quot;
what ?
what the fuck ? this shit is crazy .
now he &apos;s killing us .
call the locksmith .
and get that asshole from the alarm company over here .
&quot; now you realize . &quot;
i know who &apos;s doing this to me .
killed for less .
a little uncouth to come without a call .
there &apos;s a better place for you to be .
get out . go .
am i gonna get paid ?
have you seen this man ?
paul ? everyone knows paul &apos;s missing .
i want you to think before you answer .
&apos;cause i &apos;m getting to the bottom of this .
the bottom of what ?
three months of letters .
three months of torment .
not being able to leave my house without wondering
if some coward is gonna sneak up behind me and ...
paul was looking into this .
and i think he found exactly what he was looking for .
but before he could come and tell me ,
my friend paul shows up
strangled in my freezer .
you &apos;ve got a lot of enemies , don &apos;t you , alphonse ?
three months ago you and i had our disagreement !
i raised my take to 25 %
to allow you to continue to operate in my buildings .
i started getting letters three months ago !
that &apos;s no fucking coincidence !
that &apos;s not fucking accurate !
you asked for 30 % , and lon told you ,
you could only ask me for 20 % .
so if anyone was bent out of shape ,
it was fucking you , alphonse .
who &apos;s in this picture ?
i don &apos;t fucking know .
who the fuck is in this picture ?
i don &apos;t know !
what am i supposed to realize ?
what does 719 mean ?
what am i going to fucking realize ?
what am i gonna fucking realize ?
darcy , want to give me a hand here , mate ?
he ain &apos;t got shit to do with this !
i &apos;ve been picking up from harry for over a year .
no . he &apos;s a fucking liar
so you shut the fuck up .
i &apos;m gonna ask you again . what am i supposed to realize ?
i don &apos;t care what you think i &apos;ve done to you ,
you are not sanctioned to kill me .
that much i do fucking know .
so it &apos;s not on , you even coming here !
&quot; not on &quot; ?
the term is , &quot; not cool . &quot;
it &apos;s you fucking english .
you always do shit like that .
alphonse , just ...
you also make your sevens like this .
you
are not sanctioned
to kill me .
fuck it .
what the fuck y &apos;all waiting for ?
do it .
fuck , you &apos;ve been hit .
don &apos;t worry about it .
a bit better this time .
will you be all right to drive yourself home , beatrice ?

qu &apos;est @-@ ce que tu fais , maman ?
you &apos;re supposed to lie down and relax .

i thought it would be nice to finally meet you .
beatrice .
victor .

you don &apos;t talk a lot .
not much , no .
it &apos;s okay .
i talk enough for both of us .
i talk too much . everybody says so .
you speak french ?
i &apos;d like to .
yeah ?

another language ?
hungarian .
you &apos;re hungarian ?
you don &apos;t have an accent .
i worked very hard to get rid of it .
so ...
a job ?
i &apos;m ...
right now i &apos;m dabbling in real estate .
the people i work for , they buy buildings in need of renovations .
fix them up and run them .
you ? a job ?
yeah .
i was involved in a car accident last year .
i was a beautician before .
they rebuilt part of my face .
but it &apos;s kind of hard to give advice on beauty now .
and ...
i have to smile a lot in my job .
most of the time , it hurts to smile .
i don &apos;t get to smile so much in my work .
no ?
no .
maybe you and i should switch jobs .
yeah .
so , what else ?
i swear sometimes .
especially when i drink .
me too .
fuck .
shit .
careful . you &apos;re smiling .
tonight it &apos;s worth it .
i want to take you somewhere .
so where are we going ?
are we going to a club ?
no .
no ?
very cold .
very cold .
yeah .
all right .
well , then are we going to a park ?
warmer .
i thought you talk a lot ?
i thought you don &apos;t .
must be the company . usually , i don &apos;t .
you can turn here .
pull over . just there .
you &apos;re afraid i &apos;ll think you came tonight
because you felt sorry for me .
you don &apos;t have to play these games , victor .
i know why you really came .
you &apos;re just being careful .
you want to find out
if the girl who &apos;s been watching you saw what you did .
i saw you kill this man .
i saw you strangle him .
i saw you take him away .
now you &apos;re trying to clean up a mess that cannot be cleaned up .
but , i ...
i think your secret will be safe with me .
this is the man
who hit my car when he was drunk .
this is the man who did this to me .
i want you to kill him .
as you did with the man in your apartment .
wait a minute .
no .
if you don &apos;t do it ,
i &apos;ll call the police and tell them what i saw .
what the fuck are you ...
his bmw .
it &apos;s fixed .
as if it had never happened .
but i can &apos;t be fixed .
he served three weeks .
three weeks for what he did to me .
stupid judge , he sat there and he looked at my face .
i want it done .
if you don &apos;t do it ,
i &apos;ll call the police and i &apos;ll tell them what i saw .
you &apos;ll do it !
you want to save yourself ? do it !
fuck .
he didn &apos;t pay .
i understand .
he didn &apos;t pay .
stop saying that ! i understand !
are you gonna do it ?
what i did , it has nothing to do with you .
you have to do this !
he ruined my life .
i have nothing . i am nothing .
i want it done as soon as possible .
then i will forget .
i will begin my life .
and i will forget that i ever met you .
do you know what it is to kill a man ?
i will forget that i ever met you .
it &apos;s not a bug ! it &apos;s not a rat !
i would never kill a bug or a rat !
he &apos;s much worse than these things !
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re getting into with me !
you have no fucking idea !
i could have called the police .
i saved your life .
now you &apos;re gonna give me back mine .
if you &apos;re not going to kill me you don &apos;t have a choice .
t &apos;es déjà de retour ?
béatrice
qu &apos;est @-@ ce qui s &apos;est passé encore ?
béatrice
laszlo .
sorry i &apos;m late .
no problem .
you look good .
it &apos;s good to see you .
were you worried i was going to forget your name ?
convention . you forget what it &apos;s like .
it &apos;s andras who gave us the body for your grave .
whose body ?
someone who deserved it , i &apos;m sure .
is this where the whores are kept ?
no , no , you are looking for your mother &apos;s boat .
two down .
we met .
two days after when they left you for dead .
yeah .
soviet modified dragunov .
shoots 7.62 by 5.4 rounds .
with all russian pso scopes .

heavier than i expected .
i &apos;ll take it .
okay . all set .
what did he say ?
andras ?
for 14 months you &apos;ve infiltrated alphonse .
they wanted to know
why you &apos;ve been waiting for so long to do what needs to be done .
he said if he was lucky enough to be standing , like you are ,
he &apos;d want revenge , too .
but we &apos;re all worried you wait too long .
always kill the devil quickly when you find him .
that was his advice .
i said you wanted to be close enough to watch him suffer .
but i really don &apos;t know the reason you &apos;re waiting .
so now ...
now .
say it in english for me .
i ...
tied ...
yes ?
i tied ...
yes ?
my shoe . today .
you tied what ?
my shoe .
your shoe ?
bigger smile than that . that &apos;s not the biggest smile you have .
so ?
nothing . no one has seen your brother .
it &apos;s been two weeks , i am telling you .
he never goes more than a few days without calling me .
you know him . sometimes he likes to get away .
no . something is wrong .
what have i done to you ?
where have you taken me ?
i need foodstuffs .
i can help you .
if you let me go , he will spare you .
my brother , he will not stop looking for me .
and he will find you .
even if you get his money ,
even if they pay ,
he will find you .
you don &apos;t know who you &apos;re messing with !
he will kill you !
he will kill you !
monster &apos;s here .
monster !
hey , monster ...
if you put a bag over your head ,
we might hook up with you .
you have to take off your shoes .
my mom likes to keep the floor clean .
how long will it take ?
long enough to be prepared .
you say he goes to this bar every night ?
yeah .
you know where he works ?
he &apos;s looking for work .
as much as i could find out , i did .
i never thought about it before .
revenge .
but when i saw you kill that man in your apartment ,
i knew i had my answer .
why did you do it ?
i just want to know more about you .
i &apos;m not here by choice .
we have company .
she can &apos;t hear us . she lost most of her hearing as a child .
oh , j &apos;ai oublé mes cookies dans le four .

another guy . a guy like you .
this is my friend paul .
did you tell him ?
hello .
it &apos;s lon .
you know , people are flipping out .
you weren &apos;t sanctioned to do harry . or his men .
or leave a house full of dead jamaicans !
no , i told you ...
can you try to imagine ...
look , lon .
imagine what the fuck i &apos;m dealing with ?
no . you need to come see me right now .
you don &apos;t appreciate the severity of this .
you come now . i &apos;m gonna be at cafe cora .
so ... we got dead jamaicans ?
i &apos;m listening .
well , lon ,
for the last three months , harry was messing with me .
trying to freak me out .
sending little notes like this with pictures ,
and threats and fucked @-@ up shit .
i don &apos;t think he was too happy with the percentage deal .
okay .
i went in there to get answers ,
not dead jamaicans .
turned out that way .
i lost two guys .
and truth is , i could have been just as dead as both of them .
you know joe bragg ? and herbert ?
lowell khan . and weinberg ?
they &apos;re my colleagues .
yeah .
each
received photos like these .
yeah ?
yo , vic . where you at ?
i &apos;m in the middle of something .
hey , listen , i was right .
alphonse is still in danger .
this was not harry and his men doing this shit .
how do you know that ?
you know cafe cora ? can you get there ?
i can find it .
yeah , look , alphonse is there with lon gordon .
i &apos;m gonna call the rest of the crew
and get them down there , all right ?
how &apos;d you know it wasn &apos;t harry ?
i &apos;ll be there in five .
fuck .
yo , terry .
yeah ?
i &apos;m gonna look at these photos another way .
&apos;cause whoever &apos;s doing this is taking it seriously enough now
to let us know that the loans to you , they &apos;re not secure .
that &apos;s respect enough to let us know his intentions .
you &apos;re not gonna be around .
you may not be around to collect .
lon , that &apos;s exactly what harry wanted you to think .
i got a note , too .
this morning .
it &apos;s addressed to you .
englishmen and jamaicans , they don &apos;t send notes like this .
not after they &apos;ve been killed in their own house .
what does it mean ?
what does it mean ?
and this key was taped to it .
you know what that key is for ?
i want you to get the books
and the deeds together for me now , all right ?
every building you owe us for .
you understand this , don &apos;t you ?
so the uptown buildings , you &apos;re pulling out of the deal ?
we &apos;re not pulling out , alphonse .
you &apos;re just in no condition right now to pull in .

we lost him .
fuck !
you guys all right ?
tell him what you told me about the cab .
this guy in the building ,
he saw a man take this photo from the stairwell .
then they see him get into a cab . a gypsy cab .
paul was there , too . he found out the same thing .
it must &apos;ve led him to something , because he was wasted for it .
find out where the cab went .
what did you do that for ?
what i do what for ?
go looking with the pictures .
you &apos;ve only been on this crew a month longer than i have .
what if all this shit that &apos;s happening to alphonse
is because of something that went down before you came ?
this is an opportunity of magnumus proportions to me .
how &apos;s that ?
of finding my next step in the organization .
yeah , well , there might not be much of an organization left .
i could run this place for him , victor .
better than terry , a whole lot better than fucking kilroy .
i ain &apos;t joking around .
if i could just crack this shit for ...
this is serious shit , darcy .
have enough money to buy lise and theo what they need .
move up the ladder .
what the fuck !
it &apos;s lise &apos;s car . mine &apos;s in the shop .
what ? are you back with her ?
yeah , she &apos;s acknowledging me .
it &apos;s a start , right ?
i promised her i &apos;d make a plan . get ahead .
for her and for theo .
just don &apos;t get too smart .
you saw what happened to paul .
i don &apos;t want anything to happen to you .
i &apos;m smarter than paul .
i &apos;m tired of being taken for a fucking douche .
i saw alphonse respected me back there .
yeah ?
i saw it in his eyes .
all right . we &apos;re good .
that &apos;s it .
go on .
what the fuck .
i tied my shoe today .
i tied my shoe today .
i tied my shoe today .
hello .
this is victor , is beatrice ...
hello . this is victor . is beatrice there ?
c &apos;est quoi ?
je sais pas . y a rien de réponse .
hello .
it &apos;s me .
i believe you have something of mine ?
yeah .
why did you follow me ?
it &apos;s not the first time .
i wanted to find out more about you .
i think it &apos;s lucky i did .
you want some water ?
sure .
so , who are you ?
my real name is laszlo kerik .
i was born in hungary .
a few years ago my wife and i came to america .
i was an engineer before .
we came here looking for work .
we took an apartment in a building .
it was a building they wanted to control .
the man i saw ?
they got most people out of the building .
one night they came and they fired some shots .
to scare us .
so we would leave .
a bullet went through a wall ,
and my daughter was killed while she slept .
we were going to testify . my wife and i.
the man responsible for it all , alphonse ,
he gave his orders to make sure he never went to trial .
and they were followed .
he was afraid to use his own guys ,
so they sent a crew of albanians after us .
they killed my wife ,
and they thought they killed me , too .
and they should have made sure of it .
cigarette ?
yeah .
when i manage to forget what happened to me ,
when there are no mirrors , and no people that reminds me ,
when my mom makes me laugh .
in these moments ,
i have hope .
maman says that i ...
that it &apos;s these moments that makes the pain bearable .
these moments .
i should try and find them where i can and hang onto them .
but they &apos;re fleeting .
and then i remember ,
and i &apos;m filled with so much hate
so i want to set the whole world on fire .
i &apos;m sorry i made you tell me about your family .
i don &apos;t want to be one of those people that reminds you .
when you &apos;re the one who is going to help me forget .
these men , they don &apos;t seem easy to beat .
and you might have used up all your luck . so ...
it &apos;s yellow .
chartreuse .
keep it .
i need you around .
rabbits don &apos;t come in chartreuse .
did you eat the cookies ?
no .
maman makes a good cookie .
i only ask you to return the tupperware .
she likes her tupperware .
have you made any progress ?
i will .
i know .
because i realize now that
if i call the police and tell them what i saw ,
it &apos;s not prison you &apos;re afraid of .
it &apos;s that you won &apos;t get to finish your revenge .
i &apos;m going to sleep in my own bed .
and why are you going to sleep in your own bed ?
because daddy keeps care of the monsters .
why , baby ? tell me once more , why ?
because daddy keeps care of the monsters .
bigger smile than that ! that &apos;s not the biggest smile you have .
and why are you going to sleep in your own bed ?
because daddy keeps care of the monsters .
why , baby ? tell me once more . why ?
because daddy keeps care of the monsters .
i &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here .
i just needed some time , florence .
now i &apos;m going to cry .
i was worried when you didn &apos;t contact my friend .
nicholas , the therapist .
he really did wonders helping me out .
he could help you .
i found someone else .
as long as you &apos;re getting the help you need .
i &apos;m in good hands .
you clever motherfucker .
open the fucking windows . it &apos;s fucking hot in here .
hey , kilroy , you want something to eat ?
yeah , i could eat .
i &apos;m in my office .
anything going on ?
no .
any pick @-@ ups ?
make sure you keep your cell on .
i don &apos;t know what al &apos;s got going .
are you sure it &apos;s the ar 43 ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure . i &apos;m looking at it right here .
it was installed two days ago .
then there is nothing wrong with your remote .
there &apos;s a barrier . your signal won &apos;t get through .
the ar 43 is an ir unit
that is used in most banks and government buildings .
what is the application for your trigger ?
warehouse .
that &apos;s interference .
you will have to be inside the ir ring , or forget it .
unless you start from scratch , go to a new system .
no , i can &apos;t do that . not enough time .
too much interference . you would have to detonate inside .
you lost a wife and a daughter .
but don &apos;t forget .
i lost a niece and her little one .
i don &apos;t want to lose you , too .
now you know everything .
no . no , i don &apos;t .
how come an engineer knows so much about guns ?
military service . back home .
so , what you said on the phone . is that your plan ?
to get everybody into this warehouse ?
yes . alphonse is always there .
i just need to get the albanians there , too .
there are many men .
but your bombs doesn &apos;t work .
they work .
that &apos;s one way of looking at it .
another is that you don &apos;t care if you get out of there .
you &apos;d rather die than fail .
don &apos;t worry about it . i &apos;ll be around long enough
to do what you asked me to do .
i don &apos;t want you to do that . bring me food .
my mom likes to cook . it would just go to waste otherwise .
i &apos;ll wedge it in between the mustard
and those plastic explosives .
you may not care if you get out alive ,
but in the meantime , you should eat .
my rabbit &apos;s foot . if you don &apos;t believe in it , i &apos;ll take it back .
bye .
sign right here .
ilir .
where did you get this ?
a delivery came .
same bogus return address again .
they have your brother .
there &apos;s a little girl .
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s fonz . listen .
i found this lawyer .
he says he can close the financing on those uptown buildings .
and he don &apos;t know anything about lon pulling out .
is this guy clean ?
yeah .
he wants to see the commerce building .
so i &apos;m gonna meet him there tonight at 9 : 00 .
i don &apos;t know , man . what if our problem shows up ?
pulls some fucking &quot; i don &apos;t know &quot; kind of shit .
no , you &apos;re the only one that knows .
i gotta go .
yeah .
yo , vic . you with anybody ?
yeah . i &apos;m busy .
well , drop your dick .
i found the gypsy cab .
the guy at the cab company says he remembers paul .
paul was there .
i &apos;m like a detective , man .
like columbo . i &apos;m scaring myself .
vic ? right .
i &apos;ll be right down .
hey , vic . vic . this girl you &apos;re seeing .
she your girlfriend ?
no . no , it ain &apos;t serious .
she &apos;s got ... her face .
yeah . car accident .
did it affect her ?
you have no idea .
hey , you never mentioned her before .
you embarrassed about me ?
yeah , i &apos;m embarrassed about you .
you &apos;re embarrassed about your friends ?
fuck you talking about ?
so . this is it right here .
the cab dropped off paul right here .
you &apos;re sure ?
yeah .
they keep a track , drop offs , pick @-@ ups .
all right , detective ? can we leave now ?
a cemetery ?
that &apos;s creepy .
the office is closed tomorrow . but i could call them .
maybe i &apos;ll come by with a picture of paul .
see if anybody knows anything .
all right .
fuck .
come on . i gotta get out of here .
everything okay ?
yeah . i just got some business to take care of .
come on in .
so what did you tell darcy ?
your text said not to tell anyone i was coming .
i told him i was ...
had something to do .
here &apos;s your food .
i set a trap , victor .
i said whoever walks through that door at 9 : 00
was going to have a real bad night .
the person doing this to me , he &apos;s hurt .
someone who lost someone .
like the people in the picture .
and he &apos;s in a great deal of pain because of that .
and it &apos;s a pain that i &apos;ve caused .
then he kills paul .
and found he was in both feet .
victor , i want him to know something .
i want him to know that
if there &apos;s anything left in this world that he still cares about ,
i &apos;m going to find it .
and i &apos;m gonna burn it down .
he &apos;s probably wondering right now what i &apos;m thinking .
what my plan is .
and how much i know .
wouldn &apos;t you be wondering what i &apos;m thinking ?
i would .
you know , you &apos;re the only one i can trust , victor .
you know why ?
no .
because you saved my life at harry &apos;s .
it would be something , though .
if you saved my life only to be the one who kills me .
have a seat .
i must stand , please .
they &apos;re outside .
the other day you told me that if i helped you ...
yes !
believe what i say , my friend .
i don &apos;t know , my boss ...

says he needs to feed some fish or some shit .
i can meet him alone , if you &apos;re busy .
no , no , i &apos;ll be there .
all right .
all right .
fuck !
i need to send this package .
but i gotta take care of something i didn &apos;t count on ,
so can you send it for me ?
yeah .
what is it ?
you don &apos;t need to know what it is .
i need to know what it is .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a video . it &apos;s one of the albanians saying something
i need him to say to the person i need him to say it to .
all right ?
okay .
you need to get a tracking number . with alerts to my cell phone .
yeah .
all right .
thanks .
wait .
tell your mother it was very good .
yeah ?
not too salty ?
no .
it was perfect .
hey , this shit &apos;s coming together .
paul was definitely here .
how &apos;d you know he was here ?
the manager .
he asked for this .
it &apos;s a list of all the people buried here .
the guy said he was more interested in the hungarian section .
the hungarian section . did he say why ?
no .
there &apos;s hundreds of them .
what happened to that girl ?
that girl you told me about across the way from you .
you ever meet her ?
yeah . i met her .
and ?
you didn &apos;t die two years ago .
they found the cemetery .
they &apos;re getting close .
the one who found you before got lucky .
and just because he found the grave
doesn &apos;t mean that they will figure it out as well .
you can walk away , still .
not too late .
i know why you &apos;ve been waiting so long .
why you haven &apos;t killed him .
i think you &apos;re afraid that when it &apos;s over ,
it won &apos;t mend your heart .
comment je peux résister ...
pure phantasme .
ouah ! t &apos;es belle !
it was going to waste . i just felt like putting it on .
mais je sais bien pourquoi tu l &apos;a mis , ça .
enfin ,
pour qui !
hey , monster !
get out of here ! come on !
what ... what happened ?
i fell and ruined a nice dress .
let me see .
you okay ?

i sent your package .
i have your tracking number .
thank you .
hello , victor .
hello .
pars tirer ta robe . il y a plein du sang .
on veut pas qu &apos;il te voit comme ça .
thank you for returning my tupperware .
of course .
people usually don &apos;t . like it comes with the food .
free tupperware .
did you like the food ?
yeah . the food was ... it was very good . beatrice didn &apos;t tell you ?
she was nervous you wouldn &apos;t like her cooking .
i always told her the way
to a man &apos;s heart is through his stomach .
one of the ways .
she &apos;ll keep you well fed . that &apos;s for sure .
you know , this thing , me falling and hitting my head ?
maybe it happened because i lost my rabbit &apos;s foot .
the truth is my mom gave it to me after the accident .
she said it was going to bring me luck with my procedures .
i picked the color .
stupid chartreuse .
would you go out with me tonight ?
somewhere .
anywhere .
yeah .
okay .
yeah .
laszlo kerik .
laszlo kerik ? you know the name ?
no . no , i don &apos;t know him .
i didn &apos;t think you would .
i &apos;ve been searching every dead hungarian on this cemetery list .
this shit went down about nine months before we were on the crew .
there was a case involving alphonse
and a little girl who was killed in one of his buildings .
the case never went to trial . get this , right ?
the little girl &apos;s mommy and daddy ,
they died , like , two months afterwards .
they &apos;re buried right there next to her .
vic ?
you there ? vic ? vic ?
yeah . i &apos;m here .
i did it , man .
i fucking did it .
i found out exactly what paul must have found out .
look , i want to tell alphonse .
i want you to be there when i tell him .
can you get there ?
no , i &apos;m in the middle of something . i &apos;ll talk to you later .
victor .
i didn &apos;t know you were coming . i would have thrown something on .
maman , you knew very well he was coming .
non , tu m &apos;a dit rien , pas du tout .
well , i told you so .
ready ?
so ...
where are we going ?
you &apos;ll see .
a club ?
very cold .
a park ?
are you okay ?
yeah . good .
this is ... - the bar .
in his house , some credit card receipts .
he usually leaves the bar at 8 : 30 every night .
but he took a trip .
i want to make sure he &apos;s back .
if he &apos;s here tonight , he &apos;ll probably be here tomorrow night .
i &apos;m prepared to do it then .
i ... i &apos;ve found a moment with you .
i want to hang onto it .
it &apos;s not gonna end up that way .
i never said it would .
not with words .
i wore that white dress for you .
was that a mistake ?
yes .
all right , wait here . i &apos;ll be back in a minute .
what did you do ?
it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s done .
one , two .
nope .
hold up . it &apos;s this one .
so you &apos;re saying it &apos;s someone who knew them ?

&apos;cause this guy &apos;s dead , right ?
right ?

the little girl died june 17th .
two years ago . right ?
yeah .
june 17th is tomorrow .
beatrice .
what are you doing ?

beatrice !
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
what ?
yeah , i &apos;m walking back to him now . okay .
yeah .
hey , you know who this is , right ?
yeah , i know who it is .
i &apos;ve been getting these weird letters for the last three months .
with pictures ? with the eyes crossed out ?
i &apos;ve been getting them , too .
whoever is doing it took my brother .
you remember this problem i had you take care of for me ?
hungarian rhapsody ?
you stayed to the finale . right ?
yeah .
and the whole family took a bow ?
yeah .
and you &apos;re sure you saw the father take a bow ?
where the fuck have you been ? i &apos;ve been trying to call you .
my car won &apos;t start .
some shit &apos;s going down , man .
the fucking thing won &apos;t start .
what am i going to tell you ?
come pick me up .
what ?
bring every fucking gun we have .
ilir brozi ?
here .
vic ?
you didn &apos;t mail the package .
you didn &apos;t kill him .
you didn &apos;t kill him because you feel something for me .
you knew how i would feel .
you didn &apos;t mail the package .
i tried .
and the guy walked away , and i called him back .
i called him back , because i feel something for you .
i could love you .
i don &apos;t want you to die .
so i thought that
if i could just mess up one of your things , just one thing ,
it would be enough so it wouldn &apos;t work out the way you planned .
so i put my rabbit &apos;s foot in that package .
and i took the video card out .
they got my rabbit &apos;s foot instead .
we can run away .
they &apos;d find us .
we keep on running .
we travel by night . i don &apos;t care how far we have to go .
vic ?
shithole .
