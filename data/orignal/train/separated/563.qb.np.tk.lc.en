happy last day before winter break , greendale
time to visit our loved ones
some of you will travel as far as three miles !
don &apos;t forget to visit our winter wonderland in the quad ,
where we &apos;re giving away catalogues of next semester &apos;s classes .
whoa , what &apos;s that sound ?
is that the tippy @-@ tapping of secular boots on the roof ?
oh , well , it must be yet another sign
that it tis the season ,
because rumor has it that non @-@ denominational mr. winter
is on his way to the student lounge !
i &apos;m so sick of the dean jamming his p.c.-ness
down my throat .
pierce , i &apos;d like to commend you
for letting that one go .
&quot; p.c.-ness. &quot;
now i get it .
it sounds like &quot; penis . &quot; i just got it too .
well , it &apos;s still christmas to all of us ,
and i made you all a little gift ,
because you &apos;re like my new family .
&quot; w.w.b.j.d. &quot; ?
if this stands for &quot; what would billy joel do , &quot;
i &apos;ll tell you right now-- he &apos;d write another crappy song .
yeah , in your face , billy joel .
who is that ?
it stands for &quot; what would baby jesus do ? &quot;
and it &apos;s to remind us that the real meaning
of this season is christmas .
oh , well , thank you , shirley .
i &apos;m gonna put that in the pocket closest to my heart .
no , no , no , it &apos;s a bracelet . you put &apos; em on .
everybody put &apos; em on .
hey . hey !
you took all the winter @-@ doodles .
what are you , a douche bag ?
they &apos;re for my friends .
there &apos;s a lot of other cookies left .
no , there &apos;s only macadamia nut cookies there , okay ?
i have a tree @-@ nut allergy .
you should probably stay away
from christmas @-@ tree @-@ shaped cookies .
ha ha ! that did not even make allergic sense .
what are you , an idiot ?
okay , we get it . you and the a @-@ team are awesome .
now beat it .
oh , look at that .
pretty boy standing up for bird face over here .
give me a winter @-@ doodle .
if you &apos;re trying to be menacing ,
maybe don &apos;t call the cookie by its name .
oh , you &apos;re funny . you &apos;re a funny man .
want to hear something funny , funny man ?
knock , knock .
my fist up your balls !
who &apos;s there ?
ha ha ha ! merry happy !
this ain &apos;t over .
there won &apos;t always be a dean around .
all right ?
still waiting on those cookies , abed .
* give me some rope , time in a tree *
* give me the hope to run out of steam *
* somebody said we could be here *
* we could be roped up , tied up , dead in a year *
* i can &apos;t count the reasons i should stay *
* one by one , they all just fade away *
第一季 第十二集
jeff protected my honor .
it was like my bodyguard , but i was the kid from meatballs ,
jeff was the guy from full metal jacket ,
and the moustache guy was the brother
of the guy on entourage .
thanks for dumbing that down for us .
you got it .
so what &apos;s the deal , jeff ?
you leave your stones in your other suit ?
why didn &apos;t you rap that guy in the face ?
for the same reason that i floss ,
have a bed frame , and keep my guitar in its case--
i &apos;m over 23 .
i &apos;m proud of you for handling it peacefully , jeff ,
like a certain little birthday boy .
real men turn the other cheek .
let &apos;s see &apos; em .
nonsense .
men were wired to fight each other
so that women could choose the right mate .
no , the real reason men fight
is to release their pent @-@ up gayness .
that guy wasn &apos;t gay . he had a moustache .
you know what i have ? finals .
are we cramming for spanish or not ?
i need a 65 , or i &apos;m gonna flunk the class .
why didn &apos;t you do the extra @-@ credit assignments
if you knew that you were ...
failing ?
because doing more than the minimum work
is my definition of ...
failing .
quick question-- are you all coming
to my christmas party right after the final ,
or are you stopping home to change
into your christmas outfits ?
i guess i could wear one of my hanukah sweaters .
uh , annie ...
i @-@ i didn &apos;t know you weren &apos;t , um , christian .
yep .
one might even say i &apos;m jewish .
oh , t @-@ that &apos;s good for you . t @-@ that &apos;s wonderful .
i respect all religions of the world .
i &apos;m muslim .
jehovah &apos;s witness .
atheist .
the lord is testing me .
guys , this is a subject that breeds conflicts .
can we please do--
what religion are you , jeff ?
i &apos;m agnostic .
agnostic-- lazy man &apos;s atheist .
i &apos;m born @-@ again .
oh
yeah , we had a re @-@ birthing ritual
in my friend &apos;s hot tub .
i &apos;m now a level @-@ five laser lotus in my buddhist community .
uh , that does not sound like buddhism .
are you sure you &apos;re not in a cult ?
just by asking me that question ,
you &apos;ve put me back down to a level four .
you now owe me 2,000 energon cubes .
do you know how foolish you sound right now ?
what else do you believe in , blood transfusions ?
jehovah &apos;s witnesses are a type of christian , right , troy ?
yeah , but we don &apos;t celebrate birthdays or christmas ,
and we can &apos;t drink .
but it helps .
so you &apos;re like a muslim . salaam alaikum .
shama @-@ lama @-@ ding @-@ dong .
wow , don &apos;t we have a diverse little family .
i say we open up this-- this party to all faiths .
i brought my star of bethlehem ,
which led the wise men to the savior of all mankind .
and you guys can bring a little trinket or doodad
from your philosophies .
sounds good ?
as an agnostic ,
i &apos;m gonna bring my winning smile .
that &apos;s not enough .
ugh ! so boring .
done . hee hee .
hee hee .
hmm . feliz navidad .
&quot; true or falso or none of the above &quot; ?
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
hey , look at that .
forehead &apos;s taking a test .
why don &apos;t you get going , chuck norris ?
did you just shoo me ?
why don &apos;t you just kiss him already ?
dude , i will shoo your nose down your throat !
senor chang , can you do something about this ?
i &apos;ll allow it .
que pasa here , huh ?
it &apos;s usted , dude . even i know that .
you picked the wrong day to correct my spanish , no sleeves .
it &apos;s on !
he &apos;s doing this for me . he &apos;s my bodyguard .
you wanna dance ?
maybe to some show tunes ?
no , i want to beat the crap out of you .
and i &apos;m gonna enjoy it ,
because you &apos;re just like this school .
you &apos;re obnoxious , you &apos;re cramping my style ,
and you smell like french @-@ fry oil .
i don &apos;t get it !
3 : 00 ! bike rack !
but not the one by the parking lot !
right ! the one by the trash cans near the orange cones
where they &apos;re building the wheelchair ramp !
best exam ever .
that guy &apos;s awesome , man .
so help me if that jerk @-@ weed made me fail .
well , i aced it , amigo . that means &quot; cousin . &quot;
so what &apos;s my role going to be in the fight ?
is there a key moment where i finally stand up for myself
and take revenge on the villain ?
uh , maybe you should just hang back .
yeah i will . in his face !
whatever you do ,
don &apos;t tell shirley about the fight .
she &apos;ll start in with all her mother @-@ y , guilt @-@ inducing powers .
you know what i mean ?
no . i &apos;m wearing this jesus bracelet
&apos;cause it gets me chicks .
i know guys like this mike .
he used to be a nerd . now he &apos;s a meathead .
dangerous combo .
tyson , lou ferrigno , rosie o &apos;donnell .
you &apos;re a pretty big dude . probably got some moves .
yeah , i got some ... theories .
you &apos;ve never been in a fight ?
technically , no .
i guess i &apos;m too charming and likable .
call me a name .
i can &apos;t .
are you telling me you &apos;ve never been punched in the face ?
no , thank god . this is the moneymaker .
first time i got punched in the face ,
i was like , &quot; oh , no ! &quot;
but then i was like , &quot; this is a story . &quot;
and a good one .
every man should be punched in the face .
it &apos;s a rite of passage .
in my day , friday night was
smoke a doobie , feel up a gal ,
and then get your teeth knocked out by a republican .
guys the plan here isn &apos;t for me to get hit .
it &apos;s for me to hit him .
oh , then it &apos;s settled .
we have to teach jeffrey how to fight .
i know a few moves .
troy , i assume you &apos;re handy with a switchblade .
abed , you get back to the family tent ,
try to find a chicken for jeff to chase .
guys , i appreciate the enthusiasm ,
but , uh , i think i got this .
oh , well , look who it is .
we got forehead , old head ,
dumb head , and , uh ... the other head .
see you at 3 : 00 , forehead .
give me a snowman , dork !
see this , funny guy ? huh ?
classic rosie .
fight lessons in a half an hour ?
good plan .
* joy to the world *
* the lord is come *
* the lord , the lord *
* the lord *
hello .
is this your hanukkah holder ?
it &apos;s , uh--it &apos;s pretty .
we &apos;ll just , uh ... let &apos;s just put it--
there we go . that &apos;s nice .
so i can &apos;t believe
i never knew you were a jew .
i &apos;d say the whole word next time .
so , uh , do you think everyone will start arriving soon ?
i think they &apos;re gonna come after jeff &apos;s fight .
after jeff &apos;s what now ?
jeff wants to fight that bully .
on christmas ?
um , will you excuse me for a moment ?
and can you finish the manger scene ?
we know you were one of us .
&apos;sup ? &apos; sup ?
&apos;sup !
no , it &apos;s a question .
not a real question , a rhetorical one .
you have the answer . he does not .
okay , then you give him
the forest whitaker eye .
that &apos;s pretty good .
okay , hold that stare .
there you go . hold it .
then you look straight through his eyes
and deep into his soul .
and then you move to vermont .
i am sick and tired of
you saying that fighting is gay !
she &apos;s got a point .
you know , in boxing , you fight for the purse and the belt .
i &apos;ve gotta write a paper about that .
all right , i &apos;ve seen enough .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;re working with .
go ahead , throw a few at the old paws .
what are you , a north korean seamstress ?
not if that &apos;s bad .
get mad ! come on !
if it helps , think of me as somebody who annoys you .
ooh , that &apos;s it ! that &apos;s--that &apos;s good .
britta , put your blouse back on .
boys , this is not a game .
you gotta be ready for anything .
dude , that is not cool !
well , that foxy black girl thinks it is .
what are you doing ?
why does she have to be black ?
what is going on ?
we &apos;re trying to get jeff ready for the fiiiii ... iiight .
i couldn &apos;t think of another word .
idiot .
he meant we were figh ... ting .
it is hard to think of another word .
you realize there &apos;s no other way for me to take this
than as a giant middle finger
to the most important day of the year .
december 10th ?
it &apos;s our christmas ,
and i &apos;m having a party .
due to my divorce and my relatives picking sides ,
this will be the only christmas party
i throw this year .
will you be there , or will i have another family
letting me down ?
i told him not to fight . he wouldn &apos;t listen .
i don &apos;t know what that is .
jeffrey ,
i have two boys .
and when we have a serious discussion ,
i find that a brownie helps them to relax .
so why do you hate me and jesus ?
i don &apos;t think my brownie &apos;s working .
please don &apos;t do something so ugly on a day so important to me .
again , it &apos;s december 10th .
you think religion is stupid ?
no , no .
to me , religion is like paul rudd .
i see the appeal , and i would never take it away from anyone .
but i would also never stand in line for it .
and look , shirley ,
the die has been cast with this crazy bully guy .
he picked on abed ,
and he corrected my spanish .
so you go to your party , and i &apos;ll see you soon .
jeffrey , i forbid you from fighting .
well , you don &apos;t get to . you &apos;re not my mom .
you &apos;re right .
but if you show up for the fight ,
don &apos;t show up for my party .
oh , come on , shirley , don &apos;t be mad .
i &apos;m not mad . i &apos;m disappointed .
that &apos;s &quot; mom &quot; for mad .
oh , hash browns and applesauce--that &apos;s nice .
oh , what is that interesting smell ?
it &apos;s a traditional muslim dish .
it looks delicious .
i &apos;m guessing as a woman i won &apos;t be allowed to eat that .
that &apos;s too bad .
oh , look , britta brought what she believes in ...
nothing .
where should i put my buddha incense holder ?
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s a bong .
where &apos;s jeff ?
i guess he made his choice .
i want to go to jeff &apos;s fight .
as i told jeff , no one that goes to the fight
can come to my party .
he &apos;s dead to me .
and if any of you leave ,
you &apos;ll be dead to me too .
let &apos;s sing .
* jesus is a friend of mine *
* jesus is a friend of mine *
everybody !
* jesus is a friend of mine *
come on , everybody . you don &apos;t know it ?
you &apos;re banning jeff from the party ?
that doesn &apos;t seem very christian .
well , that &apos;s an interesting point of view
coming from an atheist .
i did my best to create a special christmas
for my one intact family , and ...
this is the thanks i get .
shirley , you are a guilt machine .
and annie knows a thing or two about guilt .
am i right , jew ?
say the whole word !
jewie ?
you would never catch a jehovah &apos;s witness
saying &quot; jewie . &quot;
tell it to the birthday cake you never got .
you know , there &apos;s an old buddhist saying
in my vision group .
you are not a buddhist . you are in a cult .
suck it , nietzsche !
guys , everyone &apos;s faith is weird .
let &apos;s just not talk about it .
there &apos;s nothing weird about christianity .
guys ! guys ! guys ! guys !
are we really gonna let religion
divide us like this ?
i think there &apos;s one thing we can all agree on .
i get 72 virgins in heaven .
no .
that we would all like to have jeff at this party .
mm @-@ mm . he can &apos;t come .
shirley .
mm @-@ mm .
shirley , listen .
i get that this is your first christmas
since your husband left you , and i don &apos;t know ,
maybe that &apos;s why you &apos;re being so stubborn ,
because you &apos;re trying so hard to re @-@ create something
that you &apos;re afraid that you &apos;ve lost forever .
but if you really want us to be your second family ,
then you &apos;ve gotta start treating us like one ,
even if that means supporting us
when we do things that you don &apos;t agree with .
you can start by rooting for jeff
while he rolls around on the ground
groping another man .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
the cranberry sauce has real cranberries .
look , if this dude doesn &apos;t show up ,
we &apos;re definitely going to applebee &apos;s , right ?
yeah .
i &apos;m getting into a fight no matter what today , dude .
no matter what !
look who showed .
oh , check him out . ahh ... ahh !
what &apos;s up , dude ? no backup today ?
huh ? looks like grandpa and weirdo
couldn &apos;t show up to get their teeth knocked out , huh ?
can i ask you a question ?
are you perpetually on your way to the gym ?
dude , my life is a gym !
well , &apos; sup ?
&apos;sup , man ?
&apos;sup ?
&apos;sup ?
&apos;sup ? &apos; sup ?
&apos;sup ? &apos; sup ?
&apos;sup ? &apos; sup ?
&apos;sup ? &apos; sup ?
&apos;sup ? &apos; sup ?
dude , what is that ?
all right , just one sec . these are very expensive .
all right ...
dude , you wear a bracelet ?
your name &apos;s mike , right ?
so ?
mike , i &apos;m not gonna fight you .
i have a friend that believes this is the time of year
where you put aside your differences ,
and you make peace .
me--i don &apos;t believe in any of that ,
but i do believe in friendship .
and as much as i hate you and the cast of breakin &apos; ,
i have to ask myself ,
what would shirley do ?
what would shirley do ?
i think ...
what would shirley do ?
that she would shake your hand
and wish you a merry christmas .
jeffrey ...
kick his ass !
cavalry &apos;s here . shirts off , boys !
come on , i &apos;m being punked , right ?
come here . come here .
* you hit me once , i hit you back *
* you gave a kick , i gave a slap *
* you smashed a plate over my head *
* and i set fire to our bed *
please , it &apos;s christmas .
it &apos;s december 10th !
not the moneymaker . not the moneymaker !
you &apos;re welcome !
* sensible night *
* appropriate night *
* snow on ground *
* left and right *
* round yon purchase of decorative things *
* tolerant rewrite *
* of carols to sing *
* function with relative ease *
* function with relative ease *
yeah ! that was really good .
yeah !
that was nice .
thank you , thank you . i get it , yes .
it is i , sir chang .
shakira , hold this .
so ... i have finished grading everyone &apos;s finals ,
and all of you are moving on .
yeah .
heh heh heh , except ... for jeff .
turns out you--
pause for dramatic effect--
will be seeing me next semester .
noooooooo !
in spanish 102 ! heh heh heh .
because he passed , you know .
and i &apos;m the only spanish teacher .
i meant about jeff passing .
you being our spanish teacher ...
man , mike got you good .
actually , uh , that was my present to jeff .
i don &apos;t care . i got a mountain to shred .
jeffrey , you &apos;re a man now .
how &apos;s it feel ?
i got hit in the face , like , four times
before you punched me .
some people just don &apos;t know how to say thank you .
pierce , thank you .
and thanks to all of you
for showing up and having my back
when we fought those fly dancers .
so , uh ...
merry ...
no , no , no , no , no .
&quot; holiday . &quot;
actually , i was gonna say merry semester
and happy new one .
here we go . here we go .
