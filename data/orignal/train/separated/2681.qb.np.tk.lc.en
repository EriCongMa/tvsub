anyway , favreau snapped her right up .
that movie he did , &quot; swingers . &quot;
vince vaughn is so cute .
so christopher , how goes the screenplay ?
it &apos;s one of the best i &apos;ve ever read .
hey , easy , okay ?
what &apos;s he like in person ?
incredibly funny , smart ,
jon &apos;s totally accessible . you guys should come visit the set .
no , i meant vince vaughn .
great , great , a friend .
so , when do we get to read this opus ?
i flushed it a long time ago .
remember what i told you on the phone ? mob theme stories are always hot .
you should &apos;ve learned to keep your mouth shut .
what do you do , adriana ?
right now i &apos;m in the food service industry .
christopher
you , get up .
what ? me ?
hey , bridge and tunnel boy , chill out .
hey , guys , let &apos;s go to tribeca grill .
it &apos;s cooler , it &apos;s better .
why are we leaving ?
just do it .
she seemed so down to earth for a hollywood person .
what &apos;s with those clothes ? she in the fucking &quot; addams family &quot; ?
that &apos;s prada !
if i was greg , i wouldn &apos;t allow it .
look at you , you look like a fucking woman , not a bellhop .
jon favreau , he &apos;s great !
he &apos;s also a writer , you should show him your script .
&quot; swingers &quot; ?
he can suck my dick , that swings , too .
that acting class really rubbed you the wrong way .
i love movies , but i just want to be a player .
i don &apos;t want to fuck around with all this other shit .
so ? be a player .
we &apos;ll go to the set , she invited us !
slip him your script .
that &apos;s what they call it , slipping the script .
would it be so friggin &apos; horrible to attend a premier ?
i don &apos;t even have the thing . i threw it away .
what ?
you have a copy ?
i told you , i &apos;m not interested .
i believe in you .
it wasn &apos;t my fault !
you stole my car .
where &apos;s the trust in this house ?
when i get confirmed i &apos;m gonna be a man . so how come i can &apos;t drive ?
you really want to get into this ?
who was that man that we had to pick up at camp last year for bed wetting ?
that was the year before last .
you could have killed those girls .
that would &apos;ve been interesting .
what did you just say ?
death just shows the ultimate absurdity of life .
are you trying to get me to lose my temper ?
cause i &apos;m about to put you through that goddamn window .
see ? that &apos;s what i mean .
life is absurd .
don &apos;t say that !
god forgive you !
there is no god .
where is this coming from ?
they teach you this crap at school ?
is this this new english teacher , mr. clark ?
where is he from ?
answer me !
oberlin .
want him to read something other than &quot; hustler &quot; ?
hello , he got assigned &quot; the stranger . &quot;
what do you think education is ? you just make more money ?
this is education .
do you ever think , like , why were we born ?
madame de stael said , &quot; in life one must choose before boredom and suffering . &quot;
go to your room .
no , i &apos;m serious . why were we born ?
we were born because of adam and eve , that &apos;s why .
now go upstairs and do your math .
algebra ? that &apos;s the most boring .
your other choice is suffering . you want to start now ?
move your ass !
jesus christ , let me think .
you wake me up
my head &apos;s all cobwebs .
wyczchuk , wyczchuk ...
waldemar wyczchuk .
you had lobster fra diavolo with him in atlantic city on the 14th of this month .
he got blown up ? fuck .
we &apos;re not necessarily trying to pin this on soprano
we &apos;re drawing no conclusions . but what do you got for me ?
if i had some coffee
cut the quips !
tell me about the merger talks .
what do you want me to say ?
philadelphia &apos;s been putting pressure on the shy business ?
that &apos;s been going on since moses wore short pants .
tony &apos;s still resisting the philly overtures ?
sometimes , puss &apos; , you don &apos;t act like
a guy that &apos;s facing 30 to life for selling h .
don &apos;t get heavy with me .
you come to my house because somebody &apos;s leaning on your ass ?
8 : 00 in the morning you come to my house ?
you know what this looks like ? i &apos;m doing all i can to help you guys .
one time tony bought a pool table from wyczchuk .
so he &apos;s sitting there and he asks me ,
&quot; if there &apos;s no god , why was i born ? &quot;
he tells me he &apos;s got no purpose .
how &apos;d you answer him ?
i told him it cost about 150 grand to bring him up so far ,
so if he &apos;s got no purpose i want a fucking refund .
are you angry with anthony jr . about the car ?
you can &apos;t put shit back on the donkey . boys will be boys .
that &apos;s not normal .
adolescent angst is very normal .
you never went through it ?
you think my mother and father are gonna stand for that shit ?
how is your mother ?
she &apos;s dead to me .
and how &apos;s anthony jr . been taking it ?
what ? about the family ?
about you &apos;re no relationship with his grandmother .
how &apos;s he supposed to understand that ?
and in general , the whole strain of the current atmosphere in your household ?
but that don &apos;t give him the right to mouth off .
sounds to me like anthony jr . may have stumbled onto existentialism .
fucking internet .
no , it &apos;s a european philosophy .
after world war ii ,
people were disillusioned by the sheer weight of the horrors .
that &apos;s when the whole idea took root that there were no absolute truths .
you believe that ?
in your family ,
even motherhood is up for debate .
i teach him to love and respect and appreciate his mother .
what about your mother ?
anthony , i think it &apos;s important we talk about your mother
don &apos;t need to .
she showed her true colors , that &apos;s all .
has anthony jr . heard you say &quot; she &apos;s dead to me &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know .
don &apos;t you think that kind of talk could lead a kid to embrace these ideas ?
oh , so , now this is my fault ?
no
when some people first realize that they &apos;re solely responsible
for their decisions , actions , and beliefs ,
and that death lies at the end of every road , .
they can be overcome with intense dread
intense dread ?
a dull , aching anger
that leads them to conclude that the only absolute truth
is death .
i think the kid &apos;s onto something .
okay , ready ? ready to go ?
standby to roll , quiet please !
roll sound !
camera !
smoke out , camera &apos;s rolling !
and , action !
my leg , i think it &apos;s broken .
okay , cut !
cut
alright , check the gate .
check the gate .
michele , can i talk to you ?
c &apos;mon .
holy shit , that &apos;s
she was in &quot; kings of comedy . &quot;
and the other one , too . that movie my girlfriend likes with uma
what &apos;s her name ?
jon , this is christopher .
hey , how &apos;s it going ?
it &apos;s a real treat to meet you . &quot; swingers &quot; kicked ass .
thanks , thank you .
thanks for coming out here , i appreciate it , seriously .
what were you doing before you started writing for &quot; los angeles &quot; ?
jon , this is christopher .
oh , oh , i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s a guy from &quot; los angeles &quot; magazine coming down here
to do a story on my favorite place for breakfast .
but you &apos;re the guy from jersey , right ?
very , very cool .
michele foreman , our director ,
she &apos;s from jersey , you see her first picture ?
she &apos;s a director ?
beautiful film , it won the audience award at sundance .
it was also hilariously funny ,
this lesbian- romantic screwball comedy she did .
this one &apos;s much more mainstream , it &apos;s about spies .
so , anyway , we &apos;re getting ready to shoot the last scene .
this is the one where the two lesbians , the lovers , they die .
janeane , her character &apos;s zephyr
that &apos;s her fucking name .
janeane garofalo .
yeah , so she &apos;s been chasing gina , sandra , all around the country .
gina ?
gina shecter from brooklyn , that &apos;s the character .
so they end up here
in soho where they just had a standoff , they shot each other .
quiet please !
excuse me .
and smoke !
standby , to roll , quiet please !
the silencers underscore their voiceless place in society .
camera &apos;s rolling !
and action !
spin the wheel !
i never had an egg cream .
they &apos;re not coming for either one of us .
you live your whole life in a place
and never taste the thing it &apos;s famous for .
couldn &apos;t hear the fucking shots with this thing .
there &apos;s a place on st. mark &apos;s
it &apos;s over , you bitch .
don &apos;t do it .
michele i &apos;m sorry
i &apos;m sorry , sorry , sorry . can we cut for a second ?
cut !
are we really gonna say &quot; bitch &quot; ?
you don &apos;t like &quot; bitch &quot; ?
we discussed this , we &apos;re losing light .
it &apos;s the last thing my lover says to me .
i don &apos;t find it particularly interesting .
you &apos;re thinking you should shoot her again ?
no , wait a minute
i don &apos;t think shooting &apos;s right in this case . her &apos;s strength is her passivity .
whose passivity ?
zephyr .
in this case .
in this case .
i think he &apos;s right , janeane .
throughout the rest of the piece , you got testes to burn .
is there anything other than &quot; bitch &quot; ?
buchiach .
what ?
let that one
call that one &quot; buchiach . &quot;
that sounds more interesting .
bu-- what ?
buchiach . if she &apos;s from brooklyn
that sounds okay .
okay , let &apos;s roll .
what does it mean ?
cunt .
cunt , i like that .
okay , picture &apos;s up , let &apos;s lock it up !
standby to roll !
quiet
roll sound !
camera &apos;s rolling !
we are rolling !
quiet !
smoke !
what &apos;s going on with you ?
nothing .
&quot; nothing . &quot;
you know , that &quot; no god &quot; shit , that upset your mother very much .
it &apos;s not &quot; no god , &quot; its just god is dead .
who said that ?
nitch , he &apos;s a 19th century philosopher from germany .
anyway , that &apos;s why i &apos;m not getting confirmed .
enough with that shit .
your confirmation &apos;s this weekend and you are getting confirmed .
that sucks my nut .
hey !
you got a lot of balls . you go to catholic school and your mother wants it .
what does she know ?
she knows that even if god is dead , you &apos;re still gonna kiss his ass .
hey , joe .
hey , chris , how &apos;s it going ?
coke and a slice .
it &apos;s the best pie in jersey . what do you guys want ?
anything , it &apos;s taken care of .
same thing , coke and a slice .
coke and a slice .
you got it .
that laundry across the street ,
that &apos;s where joe &apos;s restaurant used to be . willie moretti he bought it .
moretti was sinatra &apos;s guardian angel , right ?
stuck his gun in tommy dorsey &apos;s
mouth and bought sinatra &apos;s contract for a dollar .
that &apos;s like the inspiration for johnny
fontaine and the studio boss in gf one , right ?
right .
that &apos;s the one beef i had with &quot; swingers . &quot;
you guys patterned yourselves after frank and dean ,
but there was like a pussy- assness to it .
i mean , it was kind of the point of the piece
so , you brought us your script .
yeah , but
c &apos;mon , let &apos;s see it .
no , you &apos;re jon favreau .
&quot; rocky marciano , &quot; &quot; deep impact , &quot; &quot; swingers . &quot;
your script is set in the world that
i &apos;m interested in doing my next project on .
a picture on the life of crazy joe gallo .
they already did &quot; the gang that couldn &apos;t shoot straight . &quot;
yeah , but i see gallo as this tragic figure .
he was a flawed and blinkered guy , but he wanted to learn , to grow ,
to read , to paint .
he had this yearning , this hunger for
fuck your mother , what &apos;s the word ?
you as joey gallo , i don &apos;t see that .
i &apos;m part italian .
vince , maybe , vaughn .
this project happens to be a personal passion of mine .
i could play joey gallo
but i don &apos;t want to be an actor unless i can play myself .
which is totally understandable .
listen , ever since amy told me about you ,
i thought maybe we could work together .
you could tell me the way shit goes down , what makes sense ,
what people really say ,
joey gallo , i was like three years old when he got whacked .
yeah , but speech patterns . you saw &quot; swingers . &quot;
whatever you think of that motherfucker , man ,
it &apos;s , like , you can tell it &apos;s extremely important to me how people really talk .
like that &quot; buchiach &quot; thing . how could i forget that fucking thing ?
i grew up right in queens .
i guess it is a long time ago .
you wouldn &apos;t be betraying any oath thing .
holy fucking shit , that thing is still alive ?
if i told you 15 years ago that she was a piece of ass , would you believe me ?
what ?
what happened ?
forget it .
c &apos;mon , man , we &apos;re just talking .
wise- guy friend of mine would kill me if he knew i told you .
this made guy
had the most discriminating eye when it comes to t &amp; a .
he &apos;s at a club one night , this broad &apos;s all over him .
and she &apos;s got a really nice body , she &apos;s horny as hell .
they step outside , they walk over to this picnic ground .
she starts blowing him next to this swing set .
he &apos;s about to shoot his load , he reaches down to start fingering ,
undoes the skirt , reaches in , grabs hold of a goddamn prick .
jesus christ .
&quot; crying game . &quot;
this is a true story .
so my friend can &apos;t let this story get out .
he wants to humiliate the freak as much as he was humiliated .
so he gets this fucking acid , you know , burns everything .
he pours it on her arms , on her face , everywhere ,
her prick .
that &apos;s one bad motherfucker .
that &apos;s how good looking this broad used to look ,
had this wise- guy friend of mine totally fooled .
she had to get a glass eye .
hey , look who &apos;s here .
you can &apos;t say hello to your uncle ?
hey , uncle pussy .
look what my little friend did to carmela &apos;s car .
what were you thinking ?
you got to learn to respect the value of things . this is your own property .
here , go get a soda .
the longest fucking car ride of my life .
what &apos;s the matter ?
it &apos;s the kid , he used to be happy- go- lucky .
now he &apos;s moody , he questions the universe .
like father , like son .
fuck you , i &apos;m serious .
you &apos;re his confirmation sponsor . do something with him .
alright , alright . but 13 , 14 , they start getting broody .
it &apos;s getting so i don &apos;t want to be with him .
if you gotta use a belt , go ahead .
he &apos;s bombing out in school . he got a &quot; c , &quot; three &quot; ds &quot; and an &quot; f . &quot;
look at this kid .
how you making out in school ?
i got a &quot; c , &quot; three &quot; ds &quot; and an &quot; f . &quot;
where you been ?
i was hanging out with jon .
izzacupo ?
favreau .
you were ?
you went to the set ?
yeah .
why didn &apos;t you call ?
we were only there for like half an hour ,
then they wanted me to give them kind of like a tour around jersey .
they did ?
what ?
vince vaughn didn &apos;t come down there .
elbow up , matt , keep it straight .
coach is having me pull more .
fuck him . my son doesn &apos;t hit sacrifice flies .
you &apos;re up next .
nah , i just want to want watch .
you got to snap out of this , anthony .
c &apos;mon , a . j. , it &apos;s fun .
i know , i just don &apos;t feel like it .
sometimes you got to do things you don &apos;t want to .
why ?
&apos;cause your parents say so . it &apos;s part of your tradition .
baseball &apos;s not part of my tradition .
your dad , in high school , was almost all- county left field .
i &apos;m not talking about that , i &apos;m talking about your confirmation here .
i don &apos;t want to get confirmed .
why not ?
no matter why not .
if you &apos;re looking for a purpose in life , doing what &apos;s right is your purpose .
that &apos;s not what nitch says .
who ?
nietzsche .
let me tell you something .
nietzsche wound up talking to his horse .
and i know what you &apos;re gonna tell me . sartre , right ?
sartre was a fucking fraud .
he copped it all from husserl and heidegger .
go on .
you should start at the beginning .
take a look at kierkegaard .
whatever .
kierkegaard said , &quot; every duty is essentially duty to god . &quot;
&quot; nigga be a leader , not a follower . &quot;
what ?
master p said that .
you still listen to rap ?
why ?
it &apos;s just all about marketing now .
hi , welcome to soho grand .
i &apos;m here to see jon favreau .
one moment , please .
whom may i say is calling ?
jerry from newark
he &apos;s expecting me .
i &apos;m sorry , sir , mr. favreau requested not to be disturbed .
tell him his 2 : 00 pm is waiting .
he has his telephone programmed so as to not be disturbed .
it &apos;s 2 : 00 in the fucking afternoon .
would you care to leave a message ?
would you see if amy safir is in ?
hey . what you doing here ?
i was supposed to be meeting jon to discuss my script
but now he &apos;s got the &quot; do not disturb &quot; on .
yeah , shooting ran late , we didn &apos;t wrap till 5 : 30 . c &apos;mon in .
i brought jersey &apos;s best sandwich , fucking best in the world .
that was very nice .
you want it ?
oh , no thanks , i brushed my teeth .
here , have a seat . you want some coffee ?
no , i can &apos;t stay , i got business to take care of .
if they ever knew i was into this .
what i &apos;m saying is this kind of thing is unacceptable where i come from .
do you know if he read my script yet ?
i have your script .
what ?
jon asked me to give it an official read .
don &apos;t take it personally , it &apos;s his process .
billy bob wrote something he wanted to do
with jon and jon had me read it first .
hello ?
hey , honey , your cousin &apos;s here .
yeah , that &apos;s right , the screenwriter .
gregory says , &quot; go fuck yourself . &quot;
union square cafe ?
alright , i &apos;ll see you there , bye .
what did you think about it ?
about what ?
my script .
i love movies , i started with the dialogue ,
but then you gotta find the conflict and tell the story in picture arcs .
i think it &apos;s got some real heart . some good raw emotion in it .
you should probably try and finish it .
yeah , i hit a fucking wall . third act shit .
vicki king , in &quot; 21 days to how to write a movie in , &quot;
she says that &apos;s not uncommon .
these aren &apos;t third act problems , they &apos;re in the second act .
get the fuck out of here .
see , you ended right here in the middle of page 83 .
yeah , this sentence could &apos;ve gone either way .
when frankie says &quot; i don &apos;t know whether to shit or go blind , &quot;
he &apos;s at a crossroads , he doesn &apos;t know .
that &apos;s an expression , right ? like a joke , &quot; shit or go blind . &quot;
well , no , &apos; cause later on his father gets that cancer of the eye .
what do they call that , glaucoma ? whatever the fuck ,
runs in the family . they have to get him a guide dog .
but the third act starts at page 90 .
i &apos;m not in the third fucking act yet .
you &apos;re inciting incident
doesn &apos;t happen till page 12 , it should be on page three .
i knew that arc shit fucked me up .
i tried making it all these three dimensions .
here , sit , i &apos;ll show you .
okay .
see , i was thinking
if you take the scene where rocco is fucking the two asian strippers .
that &apos;s a plot point .
i know , i know .
but my question is , what &apos;s at stake ?
the jeopardy &apos;s unclear .
what jeopardy ?
there &apos;s a seven part hierarchy of human needs
that explains and clarifies what drives us .
starting with the basic needs
like food and water .
so you like my script ?
it &apos;s very good , christopher .
you want me to tell you what all seven are ?
seven what ?
the human needs .
yeah .
survival .
yeah .
safety and security .
yeah .
the need to understand .
hi grandma .
grandma ?
who is it ?
you woke me .
it &apos;s me , anthony jr .
i didn &apos;t know i had a grandson .
i miss you .
yeah , you should . you never come see me .
i &apos;ve been busy .
everybody &apos;s busy !
don &apos;t lie to me .
i know your father forbids your coming down here .
he doesn &apos;t , honest . he just doesn &apos;t want us to talk about you in the house .
you can go shit in his hat .
he &apos;s mad at me right now .
i shouldn &apos;t use that kind of talk .
don &apos;t let me ever catch you talking that way .
now what did you do badly ?
my dad doesn &apos;t like my attitude .
so uncle pussy said that i should come talk to you
because you &apos;re old and have wisdom and stuff .
his mother &apos;s another one .
well , what &apos;d you do ?
i took mom &apos;s car out of the garage and it got wrecked .
you ought to be ashamed of yourself .
was it bad ?
uncle pussy already fixed it .
did you wear your safety belt ?
yeah .
because there was an article in the paper the other day
about a bunch of teen- agers from out near the delaware water gap .
and it incinerated . and they got trapped .
people could hear them screaming , they couldn &apos;t get out .
the safety belts did it , buckled them in .
see , that &apos; s what i mean . what &apos;s the purpose ?
of what ?
being
being here on our planet
earth .
those kids are dead meat .
what &apos;s the use ? what &apos;s the purpose ?
why does everything have to have a purpose ?
the world is a jungle .
if you want my advice , anthony , don &apos;t expect happiness ,
you won &apos;t get it , people let you down .
and i &apos;m not naming any names ,
but in the end , you die in your own arms .
you mean
alone ?
it &apos;s all a big nothing . what makes you think you &apos;re so special ?
guess i won &apos;t order us any espresso .
i took an acting class once .
oh , yeah ? how &apos;d that go for you ?
but i didn &apos;t need it .
oh , yeah .
i figured out as far as movies go , i want to be a player , not an actor .
smart man , like bugsy .
that was another thing that kind of blew about &quot; swingers . &quot;
the acting ?
you know what &apos;s good fucking acting ?
hanks , &quot; private ryan . &quot;
&quot; earn it . &quot;
it &apos;s kind of unfair r to compare the two .
one &apos;s about young soldiers dying on the beach at normandy ,
the other one &apos;s about young guy &apos;s looking for blow jobs in vegas .
well , you made the movie .
do you mind if i ask you something ?
you strapped right now ?
strapped , huh ?
fuck .
jesus fucking christ ! watch out , man .
holy fuck .
can i ask you something else ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m here for , jon
it will not leave this room , i swear to you .
have you ever ?
have i ever what ?
c &apos;mon , you know .
no , what ?
i &apos;m not gonna answer unless you ask .
that &apos;s cool , man , i &apos;m sorry .
no , c &apos;mon , you can ask me .
no , it &apos;s cool .
oh , c &apos;mon , rocky ,
c &apos;mon , rocky ! c &apos;mon , ask me . have i ever what ? did i what ?
just take it back .
what , this ?
did i ever what ?
that &apos;s not cool , man . i got dialogue tomorrow .
if my voice gets scratchy , it &apos;s not cool .
what &apos;d you think of my script ?
you know , like , frankie ?
i know frankie , he &apos;s my fucking leading man .
he &apos;s kind of like a contradictory character .
in a good way , you know , like complex .
you think he should wear those taps on his shoes ?
that &apos;s the question i was gonna ask you .
they sound cool , they &apos;re his trademark .
but in the hit against rocco , somebody &apos;s gonna hear him walking on the roof .
that &apos;s a problem .
what i was thinking was ,
in this script , in all scripts , really ,
it begs to show more of the author in it .
your life , your vision .
the roof is soft tar
that &apos;ll work .
the roof is soft tar
okay .
and the father could , you know , go blind sooner
and then he could smell the tar on frankie &apos;s shoes ,
then he knows that his son &apos;s the killer .
holy fuck , that &apos;s fucking great !
then frankie &apos;s gotta put one in his old man &apos;s head !
blam , then another one , blam !
fucking brilliant .
i spent all day with my best friend anna picking out her bridesmaids &apos; dresses .
i still haven &apos;t found anything for anthony &apos;s confirmation .
with all the flowers coming into bloom , i would love to be a june bride .
here &apos;s your june groom .
c &apos;mon .
sorry i &apos;m late .
babe , i ordered you some pasta fajioli to start .
and we &apos;re gonna get a plate of antipast to share .
they got some rare imported salami .
you feel okay , christopher ?
i &apos;m fine .
we were just discussing anna &apos;s wedding .
what about you guys ?
what about who guys ?
you should make it a double wedding .
first someone has to propose .
has anna chosen her caterer yet ?
she booked villa de roma .
&apos;cause if you ask me , caravaggio &apos;s is slipping .
i heard they fired their produce guy .
enough !
i &apos;m so sick and tired of hearing you people talk about food , food , food !
that &apos;s all anybody ever talks about is prosciutto , cheese ,
and fucking fava beans .
i &apos;m drowning here .
take it easy !
we &apos;re not even engaged yet !
