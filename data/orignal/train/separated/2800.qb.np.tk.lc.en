this ever happen to you ? you go to get a glass of milk ...
... but these cartons are so flinging , flanging hard to open !
boy , you said it , mike .
there &apos;s gotta be a better way .
there is , kevin !
can we please turn this off ?
no way , kevin !
what if i told you there &apos;s a new product that guarantees ...
... you &apos;ll never have to open up milk cartons again ?
meet the milkmaster 2000 !
lntrigued ?
you &apos;re flinging , flanging right i am !
this is the first time he &apos;s used this . you &apos;ll see how easy this is to do .
this works in any milk carton .
wow , it is easy !
now i can have milk every day .
l can &apos;t watch this anymore .
you &apos;ve suffered enough.we &apos;ll change it .
how many times has this happened ? -there &apos;s gotta be a better way !
the one with the metaphorical tunnel
it &apos;s official . there are no good movies .
so let &apos;s go to a bad one , and make out .
perhaps you &apos;d like me to turn so you can bunny @-@ bump against my back ?
hey , man . what &apos;s up ?
maybe you can tell me .
my agent wants to know why i didn &apos;t show up at my audition today ...
... my first good one in weeks . how could you not give me the message ?
i &apos;ll tell you , i do enjoy guilt ...
... but it wasn &apos;t me .
yes , it was . it was him !
okay , it was me !
how was it you ?
well , it was all so crazy , you know ?
chandler was in the closet , counting to 10 ...
... and i hadn &apos;t found a place to hide yet .
i meant to tell you , and i wrote it all down on my hand . see ? all of it .
yep , that &apos;s my audition .
see ? now , this is why i keep notepads everywhere .
yep . and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t invite you to play .
what is the great tragedy here ? get yourself another appointment .
estelle tried . the casting director told her i missed my chance .
well , that is unfair !
i &apos;ll call her . i &apos;ll tell her it was my fault .
you can &apos;t . the casting director doesn &apos;t talk to friends .
she only talks to agents .
what a sad little life she must lead .
what are you doing ?
no , i know , i know .
hi , this is caitlin from phoebe buffay &apos;s office .
is anne there for phoebe ?
she &apos;ll know what it &apos;s about .
hang up . hang up right
annie ? hi . listen , we &apos;ve got a problem with joey tribbiani .
apparently , he missed his audition . who did you speak to in my office ?
estelle ? i don &apos;t know what to do with her .
so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment . the world doesn &apos;t stop .
is anybody else scared ?
if joey loses this audition , then that is it for estelle . i don &apos;t care !
annie , you are a doll . what time can you see him ? i need a pen . pen !
get the woman a pad ! get the woman a pad ! a pad ! a pad !
oh , now you want a pad .
that &apos;s funny . ugly naked guy &apos;s naked , but his dog &apos;s wearing a sweater .
where &apos;s my boy ?
here &apos;s my boy !
and here &apos;s his barbie !
what &apos;s my boy doing with a barbie ?
he picked it out at the store . he loves it .
he carries it everywhere , like a security blanket .
but with ski boots and a kicky beret .
yeah , it &apos;s cute .
why does he have it again ?
so he &apos;s got a doll . so what ?
unless you &apos;re afraid he &apos;s gonna grow up to be ...
... in show business .
this wouldn &apos;t have to do with the fact ...
... that he &apos;s being raised by two women ?
you know what ? it &apos;s fine . if you &apos;re okay with the barbie thing , so am l .
give daddy the barbie . give me the barbie .
don &apos;t you wanna play with a monster truck ?
no ? okay .
how about a dino @-@ soldier ?
you are so pathetic .
why can &apos;t your son just play with his doll ?
i gotta go to work .
has anybody seen my left boob ?
i loved that movie .
here it is . what are you doing ?
i &apos;m sorry . it just felt nice .
answer the phone .
i only got one arm . you should do stuff for me . get me a sweater .
just do it ! it &apos;s janice .
and if i get it , i &apos;ll have to see her tonight .
that &apos;s great . i &apos;ll have to see her tonight .
why don &apos;t you want to see janice ?
last night at dinner , when the meals came ...
... she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took all my tomatoes .
and that &apos;s bad ...
... because you hate chicken piccata ?
you didn &apos;t want to share your tomatoes . tomatoes are very important to you .
suddenly , we were this &quot; couple . &quot;
and this alarm started going off in my head .
&quot; run for your life ! get out of the building ! &quot;
men are unbelievable.janice thought she was giving you chicken .
she didn &apos;t think she was giving you scary chicken .
what is it with you people ?
the minute you feel something , you have to run away ?
i know . that
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t want to go tonight . i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ll say something stupid .
you mean that &quot; guy thing &quot; where you act mean and distant ...
... until we break up with you ?
you know about that ?
what do i do ? i wanna get past this .
i don &apos;t want to be afraid of commitment .
i want to go through the tunnel to the other side !
where there &apos;s no fear of commitment .
do we have any
do we have any thoughts here ?
i &apos;ve never been through the tunnel myself because ...
... you &apos;re not allowed through with more than one girl in the car .
but it seems to me it &apos;s pretty much like anything else . face your fear .
fear of heights ? go to the top of the building .
you &apos;re afraid of bugs .
get a bug .
you have a fear of commitment .
so i say you go in there and you be the most committed guy there ever was !
amazingly , that makes sense .
do you think ?
oh , yeah ! go for it , man !
jump off the high dive !
stare down the barrel of the gun ! pee into the wind !
if i &apos;m staring down the barrel of a gun ...
... i &apos;m gonna be pretty much peeing every which way .
central perk
listen to this and tell me what you think .
that &apos;s interesting .
honey ?
oh , because it &apos;s a beeper .
it &apos;s your audition from this morning !
can i use the phone ?
sure , that &apos;s what it &apos;s there for . emergencies and pretend agents .
come on , baby ! come on !
hi . i have phoebe buffay returning a page .
okay , she &apos;s in her car . i &apos;ll have to patch you through .
very nice touch .
okay , go ahead .
talk , talk , talk !
hi , annie ?
fantastic . you got it !
will he work for scale , you ask me ? well , i don &apos;t know about that .
except that i do and he will .
great . oh , you are such a sweetheart .
i would love to have lunch with you !
how about we have lunch next
went through a tunnel .
unbelievable .
oh , thank you so much !
it was really fun . i mean , i &apos;ve never talked on a car phone before .
you are so amazing ! could you do me this huge favor ?
there &apos;s another audition i want , and estelle couldn &apos;t get me in .
i don &apos;t know . it was fun one time , but
please ? it would just be this one more .
well , actually it &apos;s two .
two ?
well , really it &apos;s three .
please ? you &apos;re so good at it . i love you .
okay . but just these three , right ?
no , it &apos;s four .
so how come you wanted to eat in tonight ?
because i wanted ...
... to give you this .
are you a puppy !
contact paper !
what do you say when someone you &apos;re sleeping with ...
... gives you contact paper ?
wait , there &apos;s more . see , the contact paper is to go ...
... in your brand new drawer !
see , the drawer actually goes in my dresser .
you didn &apos;t have to do this .
yes , i did .
yes , i did . because you &apos;re my girlfriend ...
... and that &apos;s what girlfriends should get .
well , i gotta buy a vowel ...
... because , oh , my god !
who would &apos;ve thought that someday ...
... chandler bing would buy me a drawer ?
well , not me .
but that &apos;s what &apos;s happened . and there &apos;s more .
we should take a trip .
we should ?
we &apos;re a couple , and that &apos;s what couples do .
and i wanna meet your parents .
we should take a trip with your parents !
i don &apos;t think we need to because you &apos;re tripping me out right now !
are you okay ?
no , i am .
i actually am ! this is amazing .
my entire life , i have feared this place .
and now that i &apos;m here , it &apos;s like , what was the big deal ?
i could probably say , &quot; let &apos;s move in together , &quot; and i &apos;d be okay .
you probably want us to move in together ?
lt doesn &apos;t scare me !
yeah , well it scares me !
i &apos;m not even divorced yet ! you just invited me over here for pasta ...
... and now you &apos;re talking about moving in together .
and i wasn &apos;t even that hungry .
you know what ? it &apos;s getting really late , and i should just
don &apos;t go ! i &apos;ve scared you ! i &apos;ve said too much !
i &apos;m hopeless and awkward and desperate for love !
hey , janice , it &apos;s me .
i wanted to apologize in advance for having chased you down the street .
here you go , honey . this will help .
so i catch up to her and she says ...
... this relationship &apos;s going too fast and we have to slow down .
that is never good .
then i got all ...
... needy and clingy .
you didn &apos;t beg , did you ? -l said please .
was it please with one e in the middle or lots of e &apos;s ?
oh , dear lord , l begged .
wait a minute . maybe it &apos;s not so bad . how did you leave it ?
she said she &apos;d call me .
oh , god .
welcome to our side of the tunnel .
this ice cream tastes like crap , by the way .
well , it &apos;s that low @-@ cal @-@ nondairy @-@ soymilk junk .
we save the real stuff for the truly terminal cases .
when you &apos;re getting screwed over all the time , you gotta switch to low fat .
yeah , you do .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m terminal ?
not at all . you &apos;re not terminal . we just need some damage control .
okay . should i call her ?
no
it &apos;s a critical time . if you feel yourself reaching for that phone ...
... go shopping , get your butt in a bubble bath .
if you want her back , you have got to start acting aloof .
aloof ?
she has to know you &apos;re not needy .
so what you have to do is ...
... you have to accidentally run into her on purpose ...
... and then act aloof .
and then l &apos;ll be okay ?
yeah. l think so .
so i &apos;m not gonna lose her ?
oh , honey , you &apos;re not a total loser .
i said , &quot; so i &apos;m not gonna lose her ? &quot;
guess who &apos;s here !
it &apos;s the toughest guy in toyland , ben !
real american hero i &apos;m g.i. joe !
drop the barbie . drop the barbie .
g.i. joe ?
you really think he &apos;ll fall for that ?
g.i. joe ?
cool ! can i play ?
look , ben ! it &apos;s a toy that protects u.s. oil interests overseas !
go , joe !
there you are !
no , it &apos;s not . sorry .
but , phoebe , wait , wait . phoebe !
oh , joey ! oh , okay ! see , i didn &apos;t recognize you ...
... in those pants .
that tv movie i went in for , did you hear anything ?
i think i got a shot at it .
yes , they called ! you didn &apos;t get it !
okay ? i mean , you didn &apos;t get it . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s okay . these things happen .
but they shouldn &apos;t happen . you know what ?
you &apos;re in a terrible , terrible business .
i don &apos;t want to be the person who makes you look like that .
i &apos;m okay . see ?
now you &apos;re sad and creepy .
i &apos;m sorry . i quit .
no , no , you can &apos;t quit ! you &apos;re the best agent i ever had .
rejection is part of being an actor . you can &apos;t take it personal .
they said they &apos;d never met an ltalian actor with a worse ltalian accent .
they actually said that ?
oh , god , there &apos;s that face again . see ? i can &apos;t do this job !
this is why you have to do this job !
agents always lie .
estelle just says stuff like , &quot; they went another way . &quot;
but this ? i can use this .
i can work on a new accent .
yeah , okay . if it helps you , okay . yeah .
you &apos;ll never get me , joe !
no , thank you .
chandler ?
hello , janice
what are you doing here ?
just a bit of shopping .
how have you been ?
are you being british ?
not anymore .
why are you shopping here ? you don &apos;t live in this neighborhood .
were you here waiting for me ?
i &apos;m just ...
... picking up some things for a party .
barley ?
what kind of party serves barley ?
i &apos;m sorry if my friends aren &apos;t as sophisticated as yours .
where is this party ?
here in chelsea .
whose party is it ?
a woman &apos;s .
what woman ?
chelsea .
either you &apos;re seeing somebody behind my back ...
... which would make you the world &apos;s biggest jerk ...
... or you &apos;re pretending to see somebody ...
... which makes you so pathetic i could cry right here !
so which of these two guys do you want to be ?
can i be that guy ?
okay , we got some more good rejections . lots of stuff to work on .
okay . shoot .
okay . oh , the zoo commercial .
i didn &apos;t get it ?
they said that you &quot; weren &apos;t believable as a human being . &quot;
so you can work on that .
great .
what else ?
the off @-@ broadway @-@ play people said that you were &quot; pretty but dumb . &quot;
oh , no wait . i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s &quot; pretty dumb . &quot;
look , it &apos;s okay , no , no , no . really .
look ...
... i really appreciate this ...
... but i &apos;m gonna have to go back to estelle .
don &apos;t get me wrong . you &apos;re a better agent than she is ...
... but at least with her , i don &apos;t want to blow my pretty dumb brains out .
yeah , no , i understand .
you do ? thanks . okay .
sorry .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
did you make all that stuff up to get out of being my agent ?
oh , he caught me .
i am so busted !
that &apos;s what i suspected !
and then i just , you know ...
... threw the bag of barley at her and ran out of the store .
my god , chandler , we said be &quot; aloof , &quot; not &quot; a doof . &quot;
i &apos;ve actually ruined this , haven &apos;t l ?
is it time for the good ice cream now ?
it &apos;s time
yeah , it is .
you know what ? everything &apos;s gonna be okay.you know why ?
because you got 65 grams of fat coming your way .
can you hold on for a second ?
what do i do ?
i don &apos;t know . this is unprecedented .
if we did what you did , a man would never call .
i got it ! pretend you just woke up . that &apos;ll throw her off !
be sleepy !
yes ! and grumpy !
what are you ? stop naming dwarfs !
i &apos;m so glad that you called .
i know i &apos;ve been acting really weird lately ...
... and it &apos;s just because i &apos;m crazy about you ...
... and i just got stupid and scared ...
... and stupid a couple more times .
and i &apos;m sorry .
really ?
really ?
he &apos;s so lucky . if janice were a guy ...
... she &apos;d be sleeping with somebody else by now .
i love you too .
it &apos;s so unfair !
g. i. joe ? g. i. joe ? !
i don &apos;t know what to tell you guys . that &apos;s the doll he chose .
what &apos;d you do , dip it in sugar ?
look , g. i. joe &apos;s in , barbie &apos;s out .
and if you guys can &apos;t deal with it , that &apos;s just your too bad .

okay . you are totally making this up .
how can you not remember ?
