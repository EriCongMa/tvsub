wait for me !
i &apos;m sorry , poppet .
no ! victoria !
i was locked up against my will .
i cannot entertain a future with you
until she &apos;s been stopped .
tell me who it is .
her name is emily thorne .
take it easy , man !
that &apos;s not mine .
you &apos;re under arrest .
gideon is going to prison .
i &apos;m begging you , charlotte . please don &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m your sister , charlotte . i &apos;m amanda .
goodbye , sis .
is anyone else in there ?
no . it &apos;s empty .
what are you doing ? ! there &apos;s no one in there !
it &apos;s my bar ! i can &apos;t just let it burn !
the fire department &apos;s on their way !
emily !
i need more pressure over here .
help ! someone help !
over here !
you okay ? what happened ?
she was inside , she ... !
i got you .
can you open your eyes for me ?
check your pulse .
you &apos;re okay . you &apos;re okay .
get these people back ! move back !
bring her back to the hospital .
lost for words , are you ?
i seem to remember a summer 10 years ago
when this kind of thing happened on occasion .
and i couldn &apos;t get you to shut up .
maybe i &apos;m a different person now .
i &apos;ll say .
you know , you &apos;re welcome to stay .
more than welcome .
i have a big morning .
i called an emergency board meeting at lemarchal .
right . to manage your brother &apos;s not @-@ so @-@ quiet exit .
and find a new coo before shareholders panic .
i mean , who has to hire three coos in six months ?
i &apos;m starting to look like an idiot .
no , no , no , no , that came out wrong .
no , i wasn &apos;t referring to you .
i didn &apos;t mean to make you uncomfortable .
don &apos;t worry . you didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s all right . you actually inspired me .
tomorrow morning , the gucci comes out of the cold storage ,
and my assault on wall street begins .
damn right it does .
未接来电
seriously ? somebody better have died .
wait !
i thought you said it was vacant .
what if there &apos;s an alarm ?
there &apos;s no sensors in the doorjambs ,
no motion detectors , no sticker in the window .
i think we &apos;re okay .
this will do for now .
shotguns . good to have .
we won &apos;t need them .
we &apos;ll stay quiet , keep the blinds drawn .
no one will know we &apos;re here .
yeah , like prisoners .
not prisoners .
we &apos;re just being careful . it &apos;s only temporary .
tomorrow , i &apos;ll go see my banker ,
and we &apos;ll start looking for a place of our own .
i &apos;ll leave in the morning and be back by noon .
i &apos;m going with you .
you can &apos;t .
what about this emily thorne ?
what if she finds you first ?
she better hope she doesn &apos;t .
you need to stay inside for just a while longer .
i cannot lose you again , david .
once the world finds out about you ,
there &apos;ll be questions , questions about conrad .
and once you &apos;re done answering them ,
we won &apos;t have a moment to ourselves .
and i &apos;m selfish . i can &apos;t help it .
i don &apos;t want to share you until i have to .
dude , i just heard on the radio . i got here as fast as i could .
are you all right ?
yeah .
yeah , i got a few bumps and bruises ,
and my throat hurts from the smoke , but ...
i &apos;ll be okay .
you actually ran into a burning building ?
you do realize they don &apos;t pay us extra for that , right ?
yeah , well ...
i &apos;m glad i did .
so , you were walking past your friend &apos;s bar ,
and you smelled smoke ?
i went ie to see if it was something small that i could put out ,
but once i got in , it was out of control .
something must &apos;ve fallen on my head because ...
next thing i knew , jack was carrying me out .
we have to get her to a hospital for a c.a.t. scan .
one more question .
was there anyone else inside ?
miss thorne ...
did you see anyone else ?
no .
no , there was no one else inside . just me .
第四季第三集
ems ?
well , don &apos;t get up .
these were supposed to spruce up your hospital room ,
but i just came from there ,
and , weirdly , it &apos;s empty and unspruced .
i checked myself out .
it &apos;s a hospital , not a hotel .
i ran into your doctor ,
and he said that your lungs sustained some damage ,
but that you are very lucky .
another few minutes ,
you could &apos;ve died of smoke inhalation .
see , this is what i hate about doctors .
they exaggerate .
you know what ? fine .
pretend you &apos;re indestructible ,
but superheroes don &apos;t get balloons .
and this isn &apos;t just a sick call .
i come bearing information .
according to twitter ,
your runaway lunatic , victoria grayson ,
just emerged from her airbnb in hell or whatever hole she crawled out of .
when ?
less than an hour ago .
in midtown manhattan .
and you &apos;re not moving .
you &apos;re still not moving . and why are you not moving ?
there &apos;s something else i have to do today .
i just tell you that your archenemy ,
who declared all @-@ out war on you less than 48 hours ago ,
has surfaced , but ...
well , you &apos;ve got more pressing matters .
that &apos;s what i said .
okay .
i would not want to be number one on your to @-@ do list today .
daniel .
daniel .
what are you doing here ?
looking for you .
i know this is your favorite hotel .
really ?
you run away for the worst six months i can remember ,
and now you want to chat about my taste in lodging ?
i did not run away .
no , wait , no , wait , i apologize .
i did get your postcard from bhutan ,
and i would &apos;ve written you back if i wasn &apos;t busy
ducking every single reporter in the country .
what , you figured it &apos;s finally safe to come home ?
stop it now and listen .
i have never abandoned you .
what do you want , mother ?
is this the way it &apos;s going to be ?
okay . i just came back from three different banks .
every account that can be traced back to me , onshore , offshore ,
has either been frozen or seized by the government .
yeah , that sounds about right .
so , to get us back on our feet ,
i need access to any assets or funds you may have hidden .
what assets or funds ?
what are you talking about ?
you are the patriarch of this family now .
that &apos;s what the grayson men do .
how do you not put money aside to prepare for a rainy day ?
because preparing for a rainy day is the exact behavior
that brought on a damn monsoon six months ago ,
right when you disappeared .
and one day , i will tell you everything ,
but until then , all you need to know
is that i &apos;m going to make this family whole again .
okay , well , good luck with that .
oh , and since you care so much ,
you might want to know
that charlotte &apos;s hanging out with drug dealers ,
shoving god knows what up her nose ,
and she almost took a leap off the maison hotel .
so that &apos;s the update .
let &apos;s do this again in another six months .
they said it started behind the wall .
it &apos;s all that old wiring .
kept meaning to upgrade it ,
but there was always something else to do .
never -- never got around to it .
it &apos;s not your fault . stuff happens .
my dad kept this place going for three decades .
i can &apos;t believe it went away overnight .
i don &apos;t even know where to begin .
for what it &apos;s worth ,
whenever i start coding a new piece of software ,
it invariably seems overwhelming .
so what i do is this .
i ask myself , what single part
of this project is most important to me ?
sometimes that gets me started .
your mileage may vary .
yeah , maybe i &apos;ll search for whatever photos or mementos
i can salvage , stuff that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s irreplaceable .
good plan .
i &apos;ll go get a bin for the rest of it .
excuse me . jack ?
tom mullen . i just want to apologize .
i was here -- - last night . at the fire .
you were the guy who told me there was no one in here .
why would you say that ? !
i &apos;m so sorry .
i didn &apos;t know . it &apos;s what that girl told me .
what girl ?
the one who ran out of the bar .
before you got here .
19 , maybe 20 .
i think she worked here last summer .
victoria ?
victoria !
louise ? !
how did you -- - i got out of claremont !
oh , thank god !
you realize i didn &apos;t intend to leave you there .
you understand that , don &apos;t you ?
well , it all worked out .
after you escaped , dr. miller left .
you know , i think they fired him .
and his replacement reviewed my file
and said i was &quot; wrongfully committed . &quot;
amazing , right ?
yes , it is !
well , let &apos;s spend the day together ,
celebrate our freedom .
louise , i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t .
well , why not ?
look , the truth is ...
i have nowhere to go .
i was hoping we could talk , like we used to back in --
louise , i am in survival mode right now .
my children need me . they &apos;re in great distress .
i have no resources .
okay ? nothing .
i &apos;m sorry . i have to go .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
uh , i can help you . what do you need ?
go home , louise . see your mother .
my mother ?
have you forgotten what i told you about her ?
darling , there &apos;s really nothing i can do to help you now .
when things change , i &apos;ll be in touch .
oh , my god .
jack , i &apos;m so sorry .
you got my message ?
yeah .
you had a couple questions ?
i was hoping you could help me ...
understand what happened last night .
i told you . i gave my statement .
i know you did ,
but there &apos;s still a couple things i don &apos;t get .
like what was charlotte doing here ?
emily , i talked to a witness
who said he thinks he saw her running out of here last night .
don &apos;t -- don &apos;t treat me like i &apos;m an idiot !
what happened ? !
it depends .
am i talking to jack porter my friend
or jack porter of the suffolk county police department ?
you &apos;re talking to the guy who ... who watched
a huge part of his life go up in flames last night
and deserves to know why !
yesterday , after we talked and charlotte ran off ,
she called . she was calmer . she said ...
she wanted to meet at the stowaway
and ask a few questions .
it never occurred to me not to believe her .
so ...
are you saying that she ambushed you ?
i didn &apos;t see it coming .
she knocked me out and ...
set the bar on fire .
and she left you for dead . why are you covering for her ?
&apos;cause after everything that i have put her through ...
what ? you deserved it ?
she tried to kill you , emily !
so , now what ? you ... you guys are even ?
she just walks away ?
i &apos;ll handle it .
that can &apos;t be your answer !
what am i supposed to do with &quot; i &apos;ll handle it &quot; ?
what does that even mean ? !
it means i &apos;m sticking to my statement , jack .
no one else was in the bar .
i &apos;m gonna deal with this the way i have to .
feel free to do the same .
oh , my angel !
oh ! i know .
you &apos;ve been all alone , and i haven &apos;t been there for you .
it &apos;s so much more than that .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m here now .
charlotte , tell me everything .
charlotte ?
emily thorne is amanda clarke .
and she &apos;s been lying about it this whole time .
how did you learn of this ?
she told me .
either out of guilt or shame or ...
just to torture me .
did you know ?
i &apos;ve suspected for some time .
i wanted to get confirmation
and find the right time to tell you ,
but when i confronted her , she denied it .
but don &apos;t you worry .
that pathological creature
is going to get what she deserves .
and what about me ?
will i ?
what do you mean ?
what did you do ?
i tried to kill her .
last night , i went out of my mind , and i started a fire .
but she survived .
and she knows it was me .
and i have never been more afraid .
you don &apos;t know what she &apos;s capable of .
oh , i do .
she &apos;s the one who kidnapped me .
and she &apos;ll come after me again !
i won &apos;t let her .
you &apos;re safe now .
you &apos;re going to come live with us .
and we &apos;ll protect you .
we ? who else ?
your father , charlotte .
your real father .
david clarke is alive .
what happened ?
i was just coming down to meet you when the doorman called .
they give away your table at balthazar ?
nah , man , that place is so loud . i hate it .
i had a better idea .
i grabbed some sandwiches from zabar &apos;s . i got corned beef .
i figured we could just , you know , maybe chill . eat it here ?
i mean , it is ... is a kick @-@ ass pad .
where no one on the street will spot you with me .
come on , it &apos;s not exactly like that .
it &apos;s a little like that .
i &apos;ve always been straight with you ,
even back when i told you i was gonna copy your econ final .
look , i tried to get you into our firm ,
but that was a nonstarter .
pritchard doesn &apos;t even want me talking to you .
what ? you serious ?
yeah .
and i made some more calls to push you further ,
but it &apos;s a broken record .
blackstone people , morgan stanley ,
they hear your last name , and they shut down .
what , so no one &apos;s gonna hire me ?
nobody &apos;s gonna meet with you .
it &apos;s not gonna be like that forever .
finance has a short memory .
and what do i do in the meantime , jamie ?
get away for a while ... six months , a year .
take some time and smell the roses .
give people a chance to move on to the next scandal .
okay .
can you tell i &apos;ve been crying ?
i want the first time i meet him to be ...
oh , charlotte . you look beautiful .
now , remember what i told you .
we can &apos;t overload david . he &apos;s fragile .
there are some things that we can &apos;t ask him
and others that we can &apos;t tell him .
not yet .
like the fact that amanda &apos;s still alive ?
trust me ,
your father will find out about his other daughter ,
and when he does , it &apos;ll be the real story
of how she viciously dedicated herself
to our destruction and our suffering .
he &apos;s going to love you .
oh , my god .
charlotte ?
david , meet your daughter .
i don &apos;t know how you did it ,
but you managed to knock the whole security system offline
when you messed with the terminal .
uh , it &apos;s my house , nolan ,
so by definition , i didn &apos;t mess with anything .
i just used it .
okay , this is not a toaster oven .
this is a highly calibrated cpu with an int--
okay , fine , be technologically ignorant .
what &apos;s so important about 1760 south pine road ?
what &apos;s there ?
someone i need to talk to .
i used your very impressive computer ...
to a ping a cellphone .
charlotte &apos;s , right ?
what ? i connected the dots .
so , what is the plan anyway ...
go find her hideaway and return the favor ?
i don &apos;t know ... maybe slap baby sis around a little ,
get payback for trying to kill you .
i am not gonna go hurt her .
then what ?
oh , no .
no , you don &apos;t think that you can talk to her , do you ?
rehabilitate her , have an oprah moment .
that plan is worse .
it won &apos;t work .
you don &apos;t know that .
i know that you told her everything
and she rejected you
and then tried to toast you like a marshmallow .
what &apos;s to be gained ?
i don &apos;t know , okay ?
all i know is i messed with charlotte &apos;s life ,
and she didn &apos;t deserve it .
nolan , she is in so much pain .
and she is not the only one .
i almost lost you last night .
i &apos;m still here .
and i &apos;m going to try to get through to charlotte again .
you can try to stop me , but we both know how that will end up .
all right , do you have a plan ?
no .
okay , perfect ...
no plan , no list of bad guys ,
no photograph with their faces on it , nothing .
so , what ,
you &apos;re just gonna walk blindly into the line of fire ?
sometimes that &apos;s the only way in .
i remember your eyes .
you couldn &apos;t .
when did you see me ?
i brought you to the courthouse when you were a baby
so he could see your face .
i looked close in case i never got another chance .
how did this happen ?
how is it that you &apos;re sitting right in front of me ?
i know that this isn &apos;t fair ,
but i &apos;d rather hear more about you .
i don &apos;t even know where to start .
tell him about the past few years .
they weren &apos;t easy for any of us ,
and i certainly wasn &apos;t at my best ,
but charlotte was always my touchstone .
she was everything that was good .
and whenever i felt like giving up ,
i just had to look at her face .
really ?
from the moment she knew that you were her father ,
she was determined to prove your innocence .
you were ?
mom , stop .
it was charlotte who elicited conrad &apos;s confession
for all the world to hear .
david , she exonerated you .
i @-@ i think i &apos;m feeling a little , uh ...
no , i @-@ i @-@ i get it .
i think this whole thing has to be ...
really overwhelming .
look , it &apos;s getting cold .
i &apos;ll see if i can find some firewood .
charlotte ...
i am so happy to meet you .
everything you told him wasn &apos;t true .
i told him no lies .
but isn &apos;t the real me good enough ?
oh , charlotte .
i wish you could see what i see .
that the real you is better than even you know .
you &apos;re running on fumes , darling .
lie down . get some rest . here .
well , maybe your friend was exaggerating .
he couldn &apos;t have talked to every firm in the city .
that &apos;s what i thought ,
so i made some calls after he left .
they all said the same thing .
i mean , with a story like mine , i don &apos;t think i &apos;d hire me .
there is a way that i can help .
no , i @-@ i can &apos;t go back to lemarchal .
i &apos;m not suggesting that .
but i see you i can explain to your departure
and get a half dozen upper @-@ level execs
to sit down with you .
margaux , it &apos;s not an option .
there are people who owe me favors .
which is why you can &apos;t do it .
spending your capital to vouch for me would damage your company ,
your credibility as ceo .
i don &apos;t care .
well , i do .
why ?
why ?
because you &apos;ve worked hard for it .
and ...
and it might be nice to have one thing in my life
that isn &apos;t a complete disaster .
so i &apos;m your incomplete disaster .
well , so far .
that &apos;s close enough .
i &apos;m not here for you .
i &apos;m here to talk to charlotte .
you won &apos;t be talking to anyone
for the rest of what &apos;s about to become a very short life
unless you get the hell out of here .
charlotte &apos;s inside .
i &apos;m not leaving until i talk to her .
charlotte ?
charlotte , it &apos;s emily .
i just want to talk to you , nothing more .
only the two of us know exactly what happened
at the stowaway last night .
and that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to stay .
you have my word .
i know you &apos;re in a bad place .
and it &apos;s a place that i helped put you .
but i want you to know that , whether you believe me or not ,
i am truly sorry .
enough of your lies .
now go , emily ,
or i swear to god , i will ...
what are you waiting for ?
you keep looking to the woods like you &apos;re waiting
for the cavalry to come save you .
i &apos;m not the one who needs saving .
so do it .
shoot .
end this whole thing right now .
no .
that would be too easy .
i owe you so much more than a quick death .
buckle up , sweetheart .
officer hunter .
can i help you ?
you really shouldn &apos;t sneak up on a guy in uniform like that .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m liable to ... - accidentally shoot me ?
i was gonna say &quot; gasp in a really unmanly way , &quot;
but , yeah , i guess that &apos;s ... that &apos;s possible , too .
i heard about that fire .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re doing all right .
yeah , thanks .
so , what are you doing out here ?
i was -- i was investigating
reports of kids drinking up in these woods .
and i saw what looked like an abandoned vehicle .
maybe a motorist in distress .
cool car , by the way . it &apos;s electric , yeah ?
so , where does it , you know , plug in ?
it &apos;s top secret .
no , but as you can see ,
the car &apos;s not abandoned , i &apos;m not in distress ,
and , no , i have not been drinking .
i wasn &apos;t gonna ask .
maybe i was gonna ask what you were doing out here ...
in the middle of nowhere .
well , i like to get out and clear my head .
some people like to go to the beach .
i go for a walk in the woods .
it &apos;s still legal , right ?
yes . yes , i think so .
listen , for what it &apos;s worth , i &apos;m the same way .
i &apos;m a &quot; walk in the woods &quot; kind of guy .
so , should you ever want any company ...
okay .
you &apos;re not ever gonna want company , are you ?
probably not .
simon .
is there a problem ?
your bill .
it hasn &apos;t been paid in two months .
you left us no choice .
did you try my credit card ?
declined .
i took the liberty of packing up your suite
and checking you out .
your bags will be downstairs .
you &apos;ve been a valued guest , mr. grayson .
we wish you the best of luck .
oh , will you be needing a taxi voucher ?
no . thanks .
am i still welcome in the hotel bar ?
absolutely .
as long as you pay cash .
you stared down the barrel of a shotgun
held by victoria &apos;s bitchy trigger finger ,
and you dared her to shoot you ?
remind me never to play poker with you .
i wasn &apos;t bluffing .
well , maybe consider yourself lucky
she didn &apos;t have the guts to do it .
it wasn &apos;t luck or guts .
victoria didn &apos;t shoot me because --
because she didn &apos;t want to do it in front of charlotte .
no , that wouldn &apos;t stop her ,
although charlotte is the reason
that i &apos;m not heading over there right now
to wrap that gun around victoria &apos;s neck .
no , victoria ...
has something else planned .
for three years ,
i &apos;ve watched and predicted her every move .
but this , i ...
i can &apos;t see it .
i &apos;m missing part of the picture .
what did she say to you ?
she owes you so much more than a quick death ?
it was the way she said it ...
like she knows something i don &apos;t .
well , on a completely unrelated note ,
i &apos;m gonna crash here for a couple of nights ,
bunk in the pool house ,
reboot the security system ,
keep an eye on you .
a completely unrelated note ?
well , i won &apos;t take no for an answer .
i am digging the new look .
oh , yeah , i &apos;m going for a post @-@ apocalyptic bar thing .
it &apos;s cool . very &quot; mad max . &quot;
i think the tourists will eat it up .
everybody at the station sends their best .
and the , another word
from our dalmatian loving friends across the street
is that fire investigation &apos;s ruling it an accident .
they &apos;re quick .
well , look , you &apos;re on the force , so as a professional courtesy ,
they &apos;ll keep it open if you want .
and they &apos;ll even put in more man @-@ hours ,
so if u &apos; not ready to close the book on it ,
just say the word .
no . they know what they &apos;re doing .
i mean , it -- it had to be the wiring .
i kept meaning to upgrade it .
let &apos; em close it .
well , silver lining --
with the insurance money , you upgrade the whole place .
build you an awesome brand new bar .
why does that sound like a life sentence
more than a silver lining ?
she was in the house ?
i wouldn &apos;t let her in .
well , you could &apos;ve shouted to me or fired a warning shot .
i wanted to ,
but i was afraid who else might hear .
what did she want ?
charlotte .
what ?
i thought it -- that it was you that she was after .
i told you , emily wants to destroy our whole family .
she found us so quickly .
how did she do that ?
that &apos;s what she does .
tomorrow , we &apos;re going to look for another place to stay .
but we still need money .
i &apos;m going to town .
there &apos;s one more source i haven &apos;t tapped .
then i &apos;m coming with you .
no !
stay here , please !
charlotte &apos;s sleeping .
protect our daughter .
please .
jack .
i was just heading to bed .
well , then i &apos;ll be quick .
look , if this is about --
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
i was ...
i was cleaning out the stowaway ,
and i @-@ i found something .
i thought you might want it .
i remember that day .
right after your dad took this ,
you destroyed my sand castle .
i tripped .
you &apos;re still going with that story ?
my dad kept this on the wall
next to the -- the cash register for 20 @-@ something years .
i &apos;ll keep it for now ,
but once you rebuild , then it goes back up .
the thing is that i &apos;ve been thinking ...
what if i don &apos;t ?
rebuild .
what do you mean ?
what , is it money ? &apos; cause i can help .
jack , that was your bar .
no , it was my dad &apos;s bar .
it was his dream . it was never mine .
he didn &apos;t want to pass it on to me .
he thought the world of you .
that &apos;s why he didn &apos;t want me to have it .
by the end , he knew the bar was an anchor around his neck ,
and he wanted me to have a bigger life than that .
that &apos;s what i wanted , too . i just ...
i don &apos;t know . i just forgot .
so , what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m not really sure .
but being a cop all day
who clocks in as a bar owner at night
doesn &apos;t leave room for much else --
family , friends ...
people i care about .
maybe i need to say goodbye to the stowaway
to make room in life for the things that matter .
anyway , that &apos;s what i was thinking about .
you ...
get some sleep .
rest that head .
good night .
jack ?
thank you .
it &apos;s my pleasure .
no .
no , who told you to sell the stock ?
because it wasn &apos;t me .
fine , can it be canceled ?
no , you call me back !
white wine , please -- nothing from california .
you got it .
what &apos;s with him ?
you were being a little loud .
doing some deep thinking , were you ?
want to ponder life in complete silence ?
find a cave .
that &apos;s good advice .
wait , don &apos;t . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
t @-@ that was incredibly rude .
i &apos;m mad at someone else
and took it out on a complete stranger .
it happens .
yeah ?
people always getting mad at you for no reason ?
not really .
you know , i &apos;m not usually this crazy .
it &apos;s just when my family &apos;s involved .
and , of course , they &apos;re always involved ,
