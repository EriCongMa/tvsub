Not done!
If this is a sales call on a sunday morning...
Settle. it's me, JJ.
I tried your cell. listen, something's come up.
You need to get down to the office pronto.
Oh. you are kidding.
I know. I wish psychopathic killers
Would be a little more respectful of our weekends, too,
But what are you gonna do?
Is everything ok?
Um, no.
Kevin and I got in a fight last night,
And to self soothe, I drank a lot of wine.
And, JJ, you know I can't drink wine.
Why did I drink so much wine?
You'll be fine.
No, i don't know.
'cause right now everything is blurring. oh, my god.
My hair hurts. how is that possible?
He's coming out of the shower.
I hate confrontation. it was such
a fight. i hate confrontation
Then don't confront.
Just kiss, make up,
And get your butt over here.
What is this, grand central station?
Oh, god.
Kevin.
I am so sorry about last night.
I should not have stormed out like that.
You stormed out?
Yeah.
You stormed out all last night?
Yeah.
What's, uh--
Hey. you see we gotta go in, right?
Yes. y-yes.
Uh, JJ just called me, too.
Let's go.
My things.
Mine and mine and--
This is yours.
This is mine.
See you there.
Hey, let's go.
Danny Savino, the floor manager at the sapphire lady casino
In atlantic city was found dead in his office this morning.
Blunt force trauma to the head.
An empty wallet
And money clip left next to the body.
Mug shot. this guy's got a record.
Savino was a member of the Agnoli crime family
Sorry. sorry.
They're active in the atlantic city area.
How's the head?
Not all the aspirins in all the pharmacies...
It looks like a robbery gone bad.
Why was the BAU called in?
8 one-dollar bills surrounding an 8 card.
That's highly ritualistic.
And because Savino has ties to organized crime,
Agents in New Jersey are worried about things escalating.
Well, it doesn't take much to ignite a mob war.
And collateral damage means nothing to these guys.
If we don't get a handle on this soon,
innocent people will gonna die.
Hey, honey, it's me.
Listen, the most amazing thing is happening.
I'm at the sapphire lady right now,
And i am on a run you would not believe.
Everything we ever talked about,
It's gonna happen.
I'll try you again later, ok, honey?
Bye.
A chinese proverb says,
"at the gambling table, there are no fathers and sons."
No question. "godfather ii," hands down.
No, no, gotta be "scarface."
For me, "the untouchables."Spence?
Mm, probably "le cercle rouge," the 1970s french classic.
But "Den Tredje Vaagan" is definitely a close second.
Yeah, that was my runner-up, too.
What about you, Rossi?
Best ever gangster flick.
I've had too much of the real thing
To be a fan of mob movies.
Garcia, did we get the crime scene surveillance video yet?
No, sir, because there wasn't any.
That's not possible.
Every inch of the casino is surveilled
Every minute of every day.
Yeah. apparently the footage was tampered with, so...
All right. Reid and Prentiss, go to the crime scene.
Dave, you and JJ find out if savino was involved
In anything the local authorities don't know about.
Morgan and i will contact the local fbi office
And arrange a ceasefire with the families.
Yes! yes! yes!
It looks like the party's over here.
Mind if i join?
Hey. there you are.
Eddie! that's my man. there you are.
Gee, Curtis. those all yours?
Oh, yes.
Stay right here.
I've got plans with you.
Oh, you are on a hot streak.
Too bad your old man couldn't see this, huh?
Hey, did you hear what happened last night?
Danny savino got his head bashed in. he's dead.
Didn't you two--you two did some business together, right?
You good to go?
Not anymore. yes, here we go.
Winner--8 the hard way!
Oh, yes!
Thank you.
You look a little strung out, man.
When's the last time you got some sleep?
Oh, i don't know, man. a couple of days.
Yeah?
You would not believe
What's been going on with me, man. it's crazy.
So i was headed up north for a job interview.
A job interview? what about the job you already got?
Yeah. i got fired.
How come?
I punched out my boss. all right?
But look, look, look. i stopped on
the turnpike, i
Bam! $250 instant winner.
So i jump in the car, i pop a u-turn,
I come right back here.
Come on.
So i walk in the casino, it happens again.
I put a dollar in the slot machine,
$500 payout.
And now this.
I am on the craziest roll. i'm telling you.
If i get the buy-in for that million-dollar poker tournament
The day after tomorrow, i'm telling you, i could win that.
Listen, i could win that.
What have you been smoking? that's a 50-grand buy-in.
I hope you don't mind. i thought a
little celebration.
No, don't mind at all.
Money well spent.
Are we good to go? everyone ready?
Trust me.
All right, shooter. All right, let's go 500.
8 the hard way again.
You want me to blow on them?
Pile on, everybody.
Please.
Come on, be good to me.
Electric strike lock. impressive.
And hard to bypass. if this was a robbery,
The unsub must have slipped in right behind him.
But Savino could have known the killer.
He could have let him in himself.
He wasn't expecting this to turn into a brawl.
You know, maybe the unsub wasn't either.
If this was premeditated,
You'd think he would have brought a knife or a gun with him.
The bowling trophy's more a weapon of opportunity.
Is this the only camera?
Yes, ma'am, but the disk was removed.
The casinos have a central terminal that backs up and stores
All surveillance footage, right?
Mr. savino didn't want that in his office.
He put in a personal camera.
So the victim bypassed a security system
That would have revealed his own killer.
What didn't he want anyone to see?
Vince Repeti?
Who's asking?
Agent Jareau. this is agent rossi.
We're with the fbi.
We understand you've cooperated
With the bureau before when we've needed information.
"before" being the operative word.
I'm retired.
This is how you plan on spending your golden years?
What can i say?
Some guys like to futz around with little golf carts,
Me, i love the ladies.
I hear ya.
Me, i like to spend my time
Chatting with my old friends
Down at the new jersey parole board.
Listen, we just need you to come out of retirement
Long enough to tell us a little about danny savino.
He's dead now, so what the hell.
For 8 days and 7 nights of sheer heaven,
Afternoon massages on white sandy beaches,
Yes, you can win an all-expenses-paid trip to paradise.
But you can't win if you don't play.
But you already know that, don't you, Curtis?
You've dreamed of this your whole life.
Most people don't understand,
but you're not most people.
Are you, curtis?
You don't think small.
You are not content with a small life.
All this is going to be yours, curtis,
For you and your wife.
You just need to maintain your focus.
Don't waver.
It's right there, if you can just win.
Curtis? curtis!
What are you doing?
Sorry, sweetheart,
He's taken.
Really?
I'm his wife.
All right, let's go. come here. come here.
I'm winning, teri.
I'm winning big.
You told me you were going to philly.
I was. but i stumbled onto this system.
I don't really understand it myself yet--
Every week you got a new system.
We can't pay the mortgage. the bank is foreclosing on us.
But this-- this system works.
There's a big poker tournament
Day after tomorrow.
Million-dollar winner take all.
The streak i'm on right now, i could win that thing.
We'd be rich.
And then i'm done.
I swear.
I want a divorce.
What?
I'm sorry.
I'm going to my sister's.
You--you show up here and you announce that?
You're hurting me, curtis.
This is our dream. yours and mine together.
You're hurting me.
Stay away.
I mean it.
We appreciate your cooperation.
Agent Goslin.
Any luck with our mob bosses?
Well, i think we bought some time.
What about the crime scene?
Savino purposely bypassed the standard casino security.
And i think we know why.
Danny savino supplemented his income
By loaning money to casino patrons.
It explains why he changed the camera in his office.
He didn't want his bosses to know he was freelancing.
So we're looking for a gambler.
A gambler in atlantic city.
That narrows the field.
You scared me.
Sorry.
Uh, we never got to finish that champagne.
Pass.
I--i don't know what happened,
But my luck is gonna turn around.
Yeah, well, when it does, give me a call.
Maybe--maybe we could go somewhere and--
I said no, ok?
We came up empty tonight, both of us.
It happens.
I meant what i said about my luck turning around.
It's going to. i can sense it.
Right. with that gambler's esp of yours.
You and all the other losers in this town.
Hey, what are you looking for?
Discarded matches.
The victim had a freshly-lit cigarette.
But there was no lighter or matches in her purse or the car.
Our unsub lit it for her.
It means she wasn't afraid of him.
Hey, garcia, you're on speaker.
Patti Riolo, aka Francesca.
Hometown, Rice lake, wisconsin.
Up until 3 years ago,
She worked with a high-end escort service in manhattan.
How high, you ask? i will tell you.
Nosebleed high.
$5,000 a night and up.
Now she's trolling gaming tables in atlantic city.
I imagine that 5 grand a night window
was very short in her profession.
Well, this is gonna turn into a circus real fast.
Both residents and visitors to atlantic city
Are on edge tonight as the circle of 8 killer
Has apparently struck again.
No way. that's the hooker who was all over you last night.
They're saying the same guy killed danny savino.
You knew both victims.
That's weird.
My bad luck must have rubbed off on them.
Listen, you gotta forget about teri.
She was holding you back.
Every time she stuck her nose in things,
Your luck went cold.
Hey, you could win that million-dollar tournament
And then go to tahiti on your own, huh? yeah!
Live your dreams, man.
You know where we spent our honeymoon?
Where?
Some half-assed motel in florida.
Went to a theme park.
Teri deserves better than that.
I promised her we'd...
Go to tahiti.
I'm gonna show you something, man.
You carry around a picture of a watch?
You want something, you keep it close.
That's the dumbest thing i ever heard.
Go ahead and make fun, but when i hit it big,
That's the first thing i'm gonna do,
Is buy that watch i just showed you.
Then i want to see your face.
Come on, man, first one's on me.
Make your own luck.
Come on.
4 aces? your mojo is back big time!
You make a deal with the devil or what?
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
Hey.
We're looking for a man who's killing those
Who appear to prey upon or take advantage of gamblers.
Loan sharks and call girls so far.
The killings may have been triggered
by recent gambling lose.
Our unsub is physically fit.
He was able to overpower danny savino,
And patti riolo was killed with extreme violence.
It's doubtful this person has a criminal record.
He moves without fear of being recognized
In one of the most surveilled locales on the planet.
He wouldn't have elements of a domestic life, like children.
That would only moderate or
stabilize his compose behavior.
Pathological gambling is the most common type
Of impulse control disorder in the world.
And there is no more superstitious
creature on earth than gambling.
The number 8 is the ritual aspect to our unsub's signature.
It's a compulsion.
It could signify a birthdate
Or an important time in his life.
Not only is this unsub a killer but he's also an addict.
He's killed twice in the last two days
And he may not be able to stop.
Thank you.
You jimmy?
Over here.
This doesn't make sense. danny savino was a bottom-feeder,
Handing out nickel-and-dime loans to to small-time gamblers.
But patti riolo was exclusively about high-rollers.
The unsub wouldn't have naturally crossed into both worlds.
He'd be in one or the other.
Unless his fortunes changed drastically
Between murdering savino and meeting up with patti riolo.
Maybe he flashed the money he stole from savino
In front of her, pretended to be rich.
Or he gambled with it and won big.
Let's say dave's right. he was in financial trouble
And immediately after murdering savino, his luck changed.
In his mind, he could have connected the two.
Every compulsive gambler believes in
a system, no matter how unlogical.
And he'd figure the part of his
system he'd been missing was murder.
Dealer shows 21.
21 for the house.
A cashier was shot to death last night
At a gas station in town. and get this--
$8.00 and an 8 card left on his body.
I don't get it.
I lost practically every hand.
Hey, did you see that circle of 8 guy did it again?
He gunned down some dude in a gas station.
Something's off.
My system should have worked, but it...didn't.
Please tell me you didn't gas up your car last night.
What?
Savino, that hooker.
Seems like this guy was only killing people who knew you.
Anyway, too bad you didn't get the 50 grand for the buy-in.
Oh, no!
Yo. you with me?
Uh, meet me outside. i gotta take care of something.
Look at us, man.
Top-shelf whiskey to 5-buck hoagies one day to the next.
We've been through it all, you and me.
Hey. it's for you.
It's yours.
Keep it.
Mm-hmm. you serious?
Yeah.
Nice.
You were part of my system and didn't even know it, huh?
Well, you know what they say.
The reverse side also has a reverse side.
Yeah. whatever the hell that means.
It means you're part of my system, too, eddie.
$88. the unsub's getting generous.
There's less rage than the others.
And undoing. there's evidence of remorse.
Shot in the back so he wouldn't have to face his victim.
No robbery this time, either.
Wallet's intact, except for anything to i.d. him.
Is this even the same killer?
The ritual's too similar to discount it.
The change in the m.o. makes sense
if the unsub Is still refining his system.
Maybe killing the cashier at the gas station didn't work,
So he's back to the drawing board.
Two 8s instead of one could also be significant.
I know in china the number 8 symbolizes prosperity.
The more 8s the better. as a matter of fact,
in chungdu A telephone number consisting of all 8s
Recently sold for over a quarter million dollars.
So why would he be doubling up on his luck out here,
Away from all the casinos?
There's been another killing.
A guest in his room at the sapphire lady.
Same ritual.
No. his neck was broken.
And he was robbed of 50,000.
But the strange thing is,
The killer left nearly 20,000 behind with the body.
Garcia, is there a casino in the neighborhood
Of penrose and morningside avenue?
Uh...no casinos per se,
But there's a private gambling establishment right on the corner.
Is it legal?
Yeah. but it's ultra exclusive.
They have a monthly high-stakes poker tournament,
Today being the day for the month, coincidentally enough.
Or no coincidence at all.
What's the buy-in?
Um...yikies.
$50,000.
But it's a million-dollar guarantee if you win.
What time does it start?
Later this afternoon.
Thanks.
Forensics got a fingerprint match on the last victim.
Eddie Langdon. we're looking into him.
Hey, any luck?
No, they don't want to allocate agency funds for the buy-in.
I'm still working on it.
Well, i can't imagine why not.
We're only asking for 50,000 bucks of taxpayer money
So that fbi agents can play texas hold 'em.
Hey, what about you?
What about me what?
You could stake us the buy-in.
Yeah, you're a best-selling author.
No.
Why not?
One, it's against regulations,
And i'd like to hold on to this job for a little while longer.
It's a minor administrative violation.
And two, i prefer to spend my money
On actual things,
Like single-malt scotch, a fine cigar,
Beautiful artwork.
Poker chips are things.
Maybe just think of it as like a new experience.
I mean, at your age, how often does that happen?
At my what?
Rossi, this may be our only chance
To get this guy.
All right. fine.
I'm a decent poker player.
But i can't promise that i can
stay in the game lone enough to...
You know what?
I bet you're a great poker player,
But what if we sent in reid?
I am banned from casinos in las vegas, laughlin, and parump
Because of my card-counting ability.
Look, i know i'm not a genius like the boy wonder here,
But poker is not blackjack. it's about bluffing,
Reading human nature, head games.
It's not math.
That's not entirely accurate.
There actually is a mathematical equation
For knowing when to raise and when to fold.
If p represents the size of the pot at the time of play,
Then p times n minus one,
With n representing the estimated number of players
In the final round of betting--
Ok, fine. i surrender.
Just try not to lose all of my money.
I got it.
Some of these guys have records,
But the don't fit the profile.
Keep looking he's gotta be there.
The last victim, eddie langdon, was wearing a watch
That was much too big for his wrist.
Could it be stolen?
Or it was a gift from the unsub.
That fits, given the care and remorse for the victim.
Ok, the link is set.
as soon as reid triggers the alarm, we can move in.
Halitosis.
Ok, got something for you.
All right, talk to me, mama.
Eddie langdon. high school dropout,
Lots of odd jobs, never married,
Lived at transient-type hotels in and around atlantic city.
Started his own plumbing supply business that went bankrupt.
Was in jail for 6 months in 2005 for forgery,
And that's why we were able to get a match on his fingerprints so fast.
You've always been fast, baby girl.
Uh, yeah. gotta go.
...queen.
Flush to the king.
I'll count it, sir.
All in.
You know, would it be all right
if i sat at table 2 instead of 4?
I have a pre-glaucoma condition
and the light's kind of bothering my eyes.
Thanks.
Ah, i'm calling.
I'll raise.
8,000.
$8,000. that's, uh,
56 months wages for the average person in bangladesh.
Kind of makes you think, doesn't it?
Hey, it's 8 thou to you.
Now, are you in or are you out?
I...am in.
And i raise.
3 raise.
That's too rich for my blood.
Are you in, sir?
I'll call.
Call.
Straight.
A gut shot straight draw? are you kidding me?
That is just-- that is nuts.
That's crazy, man.
Do you mind if i take a look at this?
Hey. what's the problem, sir?
Hey, he's reaching for my chips.
I was simply admiring--
Sir, you need to come with me.
You don't have to manhandle--i can walk.
I'll cooperate. don't manhandle me. thanks.
That's reid. let's go.
He's an fbi agent.
There he goes. plaid shirt, baseball hat.
Morgan, he's a white male, baseball cap,
he's headed towards the back door.
He's on the move.
We need to look at victimology again.
Ok, uh, garcia said that eddie langdon
Was a high-school dropout, right? chronic underachiever?
What are you thinking?
Well, does that sound like someone
Who has the financial know-how and business sense
To start his own company from scratch all by himself?
Sir, you were right.
Eddie langdon did have a partner
in that plumbing supply business.
Curtis Banks.
and banks pops up more than once in Eddie's life.
They shared an apartment together.
When langdon was in jail for that forgery charge,
It was banks who bailed him out. oh, there's more.
Banks' dad was a compulsive gambler, too.
Won some sort of big jackpot in 1988.
The father abandoned the family,
Ended up 6 months later dead in a las vegas hotel room,
Completely broke. drank himself to death.
Do you have an address for banks?
Yeah. 800 brigantine road, galloway township.
That's 10 miles from atlantic city.
Thanks. tell reid and morgan
To go to banks' house. he may head back there.
Yeah, hotch, there's nobody here.
There's a foreclosure sign on the front lawn.
All right, you and reid stay there in case he comes back.
Yeah, dave.
I think i know the final piece of the unsub's system.
We know it involves violence.
We know it involves the number 8.
But the killing of the person
At the gas station didn't work.
What about him was different from his partner,
His loan shark, the call girl?
He was a stranger. there was no personal connection.
Exactly. that's why before the million-dollar game
He killed his best friend.
So the closer the relationship, the better his luck.
And now he's gonna need the biggest
infusion of luck he's ever got
To escape this mess.
He's going after his wife.
Curtis?
What the hell? what are you doing?
Curtis! what are you doing here?
Curtis, you need to leave.
We're leaving together. we can do that now.
Do what?
Tahiti.
Look.
Poker chips?
Uh, we'll get a boat, we'll sail to bora bora,
And then we'll just-- we'll--
Curtis, we're not going anywhere together.
Don't you understand that? look, you're sick.
We would get to tahiti
and you would find some other reason to play cards.
I'm gonna ask you for the last time...
Leave.
Liz, call the police.
No--oh--
Nobody's calling anyone.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Sir, i found something.
Teri banks filed for divorce two days ago.
She wasn't at home.
Does she have any relatives or close friends nearby?
Yeah, she has a sister, liz dorsey,
At 3388 woodland loop in northfield.
Got it. thanks.
Babe, maybe you're right.
Maybe we can still do this.
Tahiti, right?
Fresh start, you and me?
You'd make a lousy gambler, teri.
No poker face.
Now you're just trying to stop what has to happen.
There's his car. he's in there.
Let me go in and talk to him, aaron.
I know how these guys think.
All right.
JJ, see if you can get an angle on banks.
Hotch, he's got a gun.
He's holding two females hostage.
I don't have a clear shot here.
I'm gonna go around the side.
I'm unarmed.
I'm unarmed. hey!
Who the hell are you? come here. come here, come here.
I'm agent rossi with the fbi.
If you move, she is dead.
The house is surrounded.
Now, you know there's only one way out of this, curtis.
You have to let the women go
And i'll take their place.
Now, i've seen a lot of killers in my life, curtis,
But you're not like them.
You stumbled into this mess.
I can help get you out of it.
But you need to let them go.
Get out of here. go. move!
Sorry.
Ok. that's good.
You've made smart decisions, curtis, like i knew you would.
Now, is this your wife?
She stays.
You don't want to hurt her, son.
She's not the problem.
Well, that's where you're wrong.
She never believed in me and what i do.
And when i had good luck, she ruined it.
She's not the reason, curtis.
It was your father.
There's no such thing as manufacturing luck.
The same obsession is what killed him.
He passed it on to you,
But you don't need to be like him.
I just need some time. i need some time, ok?
Just give me a minute to think.
That's fine.
Hotch, he moved to the back room.
I still don't have a shot.
Sit down.
I need just a minute.
Keep your hands where i can see them.
Rossi, he keeps glancing to his left. what's over there?
I see it now.
See what? what do you see, huh?
I see why you feel time is running out.
Sand is slipping through the hourglass.
58. that's why he's asking for more time.
8:00. let's go.
I've always loved you, teri.
Even though you fought me.
Whatever's next...
We're doing it together.
No, baby, pl-please don't do this.
curtis, let her go.
No, no!
We love each other.
This is our dream.
Together.
Curtis, let her go.
All right, curtis, very slowly put the weapon on the ground.
I guess it is true what they say.
The house always wins.
No!
George Augustus Sala said,
"a gambler with a system
"must be, to a greater or lesser extent, insane."
Hi, miss thing.
Enough is enough.
It's time for you and me to have a little sit-down.
What's going on with you?
Half the time i call i get your voicemail.
When i do get you, i don't get even
a little bit of sass coming my way.
Now, what's the deal?
Hello!
Ok. look. i get it that men and women are different
And venus and mars and all that stuff,
But i do not understand how you--Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
pump your brakes.
What is this about?
You were in my shower at 700 in the morning.
Because I shower at 700 in the morning.
Baby, you had a little too much to drink the other night.
You called me to come over and keep you company.
I know. i remember that, but--
Ok, what happened between us was popcorn.
And a movie on tv.
Which you fell asleep in the middle of, by the way.
So you slept on the--
couch.
Yes, you did.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you, god, for maintaining the integrity
Of my most beloved of friendships,
And from now on, i promise only mostly
The purest of mineral water will cross these lips.
Hey, plum sauce, are you coming?
Yeah. i'll be right there.
Hey, what's up, man?
Hey, derek.
Since the fight, we have decided
To have a standing date every tuesday night.
Good luck with that with this job.
You got a great guy out there. you know that, right?
I know.
What does a girl do when she has two great guys?
She doesn't pour that extra glass of wine.
Oh. yeah.
Ok, love you, bye.
