does anyone know how long it takes papier @-@ mache to dry ?
three hours longer than it took duncan
to think up this assignment .
i think he &apos;s really gonna appreciate the extra work
we did expanding our evolutionary chart .
oh , britta , can you hold up the final stage of humanity ?
i still think that man is going to evolve into woman ,
not dragon monster with three legs .
three legs ?
well , it &apos;s been real--
at least the paste smell has--
but i &apos;ve a date to catch .
or should i say a catch to date .
oof , hope you just come up with that .
look out ! drive @-@ by deaning !
kidding .
just a non @-@ violent verbal reminder .
the local shelter is having a puppy parade this afternoon .
oh ! i want to lick it .
i expect all of you to lend a paw .
except you , jeffrey .
i know you &apos;ve got a catch to date .
oh , like you &apos;re famous for your wit .
puppy parade ?
i am in .
want to see if those wiener dogs are born that way ,
or if they startff normal and then get wiener .
abed , did you pick up my pen ?
it &apos;s a purple pen with a gel grip .
nope . i &apos;m strictly mechanical pencils these days .
more relatable ?
it was just here .
you okay , annie ? chocolate ?
would you like me to push you to the parade , pierce ?
oh , no , thanks .
i don &apos;t want people think of me as a handicap .
if anything , this chair makes me more than a human .
you move it by blowing into this , uh , tube here .
it &apos;s the most expensive one .
i outbid three hospitals for this baby ,
and it was worth every penny .
wait ! please just wait .
i &apos;m sorry , but i need to know who took my pen .
sorry , i don &apos;t see it .
yeah , sorry , annie .
no !
not &quot; sorry , annie . &quot;
we passed &quot; sorry , annie &quot; eight pens ago !
i keep bringing pens , and you guys keep taking them ,
and i &apos;m afraid i am putting my foot down .
okay .
well , now , annie has made it clear that this is an issue ,
so from now on , we need to be more respectful of her things .
okay ? okay .
cool .
all right , it &apos;s not on the floor ,
so whoever accidentally took--
not accidentally !
accidents don &apos;t just happen over and over and over again , okay ?
this isn &apos;t budget daycare .
okay , whoever insidiously and with great malice aforethoug
abducted annie &apos;s pen ,
confess , repent , and relinquish so we can leave .
maybe nobody took it .
sometimes i think i lost something really important to me ,
and it turns out i already ate it .
i didn &apos;t eat my pen , troy .
i know i broughtt , and now it &apos;s gone .
i took a photo .
aha !
aha . i &apos;m zooming .
see ? see ?
i took this ten minutes ago .
my pen was on the table .
no one has come in or out since .
one of you has my pen right now .
annie .
it &apos;s a pen .
it &apos;s not a pen !
it &apos;s a principle .
not a good time to get a stick of gum . okay .
are we going to the puppy parade or not ?
because this is starting to feel like a bottle episode .
again with the tv crap .
hey , meatball , did you take annie &apos;s pen
to make life more like benny hill or whatever you do ?
abed ?
i wouldn &apos;t do that . i hate bottle episodes .
they &apos;re wall @-@ to @-@ wall facial expression and emotional nuance .
i might as well sit in the corner with a bucket on head .
well , i have a photography project to finish ,
and my grandmother &apos;s hands
aren &apos;t going to take close @-@ ups of themselves .
hasta la later .
was that &quot; hmm &quot; directed at me ?
if the &quot; hmm &quot; fits .
i don &apos;t have your pen , annie .
i &apos;m always lending you supplies .
you never come prepared .
if it &apos;s important to you , here , have my pen .
that &apos;s my pen .
well , whatever , people .
they &apos;re just things .
since they &apos;re just things ,
i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;d mind letting us
take a quick look @-@ see inside your bag ?
oh , i &apos;d very much mind , annie .
there &apos;s no such thing as a &quot; quick &quot; invasion of civil liberties .
oh , man .
oh , it all starts with a quick look @-@ see into someone &apos;s bag
and then it &apos;s a brisk peeka @-@ roony at our phone records ,
and before you can say &quot; 1984 , &quot; the thought police
are forcy @-@ worcing you to bend and spread .
bend and spread ?
are the thought police gonna make love to us ?
do they find thoughts in our butts ?
i knew i should have read that book .
britta , stop using the constitution as a baby blanket .
last week , she invoked the freedom of information act
to request photocopies of my notes .
that &apos;s pretty good .
well , excuse me for living free .
come on , stoney , we all know the pen &apos;s in your bag !
yeah ! come on !
come on , dump it .
happy ?
not if that &apos;s a used q @-@ tip .
eww .
oh !
gross .
yes , gross .
welcome to the gross business of martial law .
welcome to what used to be individuality ,
seized and disintegrated by cowardly groupthink .
welcome , my friends ! welcome to the machine !
well , annie , it looks like you were wrong .
britta does come prepare for one thing .
or six .
big weekend ?
can &apos;t complain .
razzle pzazzle .
attention , students !
the puppy parade is starting on the quad !
better come quick .
with every passing moment , these puppies grow older
and less deserving of our attention .
where do you people think you &apos;re going ?
uh , have you ever gone
to a puppy parade halfway through , britta ?
it is pointless .
then you clearly stole the pen .
the patriot act cuts both ways .
acally , it pretty one @-@ sided .
that &apos;s kind of point .
here my point ,
whoever the pen thief is just stood here
and watched me get guantanamoed .
and i &apos;d like to know who it is ,
so i can let them know that
they have lost my trust forever .
it &apos;s a bottle episode .
britta , we &apos;re sorry we embarrassed you
and looked at your prophylactic equipment .
your lifestyle mistakes are none of our business .
oh , thanks , shirley .
but now let &apos;s rustle through your tampons and wallet
so we can apologize to you .
oh , i &apos;m sure everybody here knows that i don &apos;t steal .
have you checked your bag , shirley ?
if you took it by mistake , i forgive you .
oh , so if i took it , it &apos;s larceny ,
but if you find it under mother hen , it &apos;s a mistake .
mother hen ? i think we &apos;re about the same age .
sure , unless time is linear .
i &apos;ll make your ass linear .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i will make ya ass sense .
girls , don &apos;t get your panties puckered .
we all know what we &apos;re really thinking .
if--and i mean if--
the culprit is among us ,
statistically speaking , it &apos;s troy .
yes , we were all just thinking that in 1856 .
1856 .
what if a ghost took the pen ?
please forgive him .
for what ?
for stealing the pen , dummy .
why would i take her pen ?
i don &apos;t even like having my own .
it &apos;s probably under one of pierce &apos;s casts .
he uses everything itch his legs .
we &apos;re on our third dvd remote .
if i took the pen , i &apos;d say so .
you probably forgot .
you &apos;ve been popping painkillers like tic @-@ tacs .
oh , yeah , right .
&quot; side effects : verbal dysphasia
and octopus loss . &quot;
i don &apos;t see anything on this squirrel about memory , troy .
now i want to know who has it .
yeah , nice try shirley ,
that doesn &apos;t take you off the list .
jeff , you &apos;re in charge .
i demand you deal with this .
there &apos;s nothing to deal with .
i &apos;ll say .
ok , alright , alright .
everyone breathe .
you know what this is ?
yep .
shut up . this is a normal day
with a bunch of friends who are done studying
and a pen that maybe rolled away .
&quot; rolled away &quot; ?
or fell down someone &apos;s shoe .
let &apos;s check shoes .
annie !
fine , fine .
someone in this room is hiding your pen .
want to know why ?
they feel terrible .
they made a mistake .
they waited too long come forward ,
and now they feel bad .
they should .
okay . okay , so , pen thief ,
we understand what happened ,
and we forgive you .
if you confess and apologize !
yes .
right . but here &apos;s the trick .
because this person now has no reason not to come forward ,
if , by some chance , i get to the count of three ,
and nobody comes forward , guess what .
we have to accept that no one has the pen , don &apos;t we ?
don &apos;t we ?
good so here we go .
one .
two .
pierce , you have something to tell us ?
yes . is it me ,
or has it become really obvious that jeff took the pen ?
yes !
definitely .
you want to make a bet , you jerks ?
lockdown ! abed , seal the doors .
nobody leaves until this pen shows up .
i don &apos;t like this .
yeah ? tell it to the pen you might have .
gwynnifer ? hi . yeah , it &apos;s me .
i can &apos;t make it .
well , tell your disappointment to suck it .
i &apos;m doing a bottle episode !
okay .
you just became my hero .
thank you .
no pen .
i can see that .
why do you keep taking that tone with me ?
oh , i &apos;ll field that .
because if nobody else has this pen ,
it means at so point , you realized you had it
and were too embarrassed to say , and we get to kill you .
i &apos;m not hiding my own pen , you paranoid weirdo .
everybody stay within each other &apos;s eyelines , please .
one of you &apos;s a monster .
me next , right ?
hold on .
can we please consider
the threshold that we are crossing ?
we don &apos;t trust abed ?
he shredded my backpack .
he freed my pet monkey .
because we corrupted him .
he &apos;s our innocent .
he put gum in your hair .
empty the bag , abed .
uh , pierce ,
you don &apos;t have a bag ?
giraffe .
uh , jeff , you don &apos;t have a bag ?
oh , i could never deprive the world
of the portion of my chest the strap would cover .
makes sense . so what &apos;s left ?
shirley , a little hugging and crying ,
and then we &apos;re done ?
wait , abed , why is my name in here ?
that &apos;s mine .
and shirley &apos;s and annie &apos;s ?
what is it ?
charts .
some kind of calendar ?
that &apos;s my persal private business .
annie , 4 on , 28 off , next , november 10th .
britta , 5 on , 27 off ...
are you charting our menstrual cycles ?
what ? !
gross !
abed , this is so personal !
and so accurate .
abed , this is really creepy .
i really don &apos;t understand why you do this .
i can explain .
oh . i thought you &apos;d keep yelling over me .
okay , i can explain .
you know i have trouble reading people ,
and say the wrong things , sometimes ,
and i noticed it was happening more often with you
than it was with the others .
and then i noticed fluctuating patterns ,
and i started graphing them ,
and by the time i realized what i was actually measuring ,
it has started to yield really positive results for everybody ,
so i kept doing it .
were you ever gonna tell us about this ?
i--i feel so violated .
more chocolate ?
oh ! get away from me !
abed just became my hero .
can i have a little--
no !
guess it &apos;s true what they sayabout the sync @-@ up .
okay , if i could just take this time
to sharea few words of sarcasm
with whoever it is that took this pen .
i would say thank you for doing this to me .
for a while i thought i &apos;d have to suffer
through a puppy parade ,
but i much prefer being entomb alive
in a mausoleum of feelings
i can neither understand nor reciprocate .
so whoever you &apos;re , can i get you anything ?
ice cream ? best friend medal ?
anything ? mm @-@ mmm ?
okay , sarcasm over .
you &apos;re last up , shirley .
dump your comedically huge bag and end this .
uh , no , thank you .
well , well , well , harvey keitel .
well , what do you know , henry david thoreau .
my oh my , mike tyson
just empty the bag .
no ! i don &apos;t have annie &apos;s pen .
i &apos;m simply a christian woman that doesn &apos;t open her bag .
what did the christian woman think would happen
when we got to her bag ?
the christian woman thought you &apos;d find it on the muslim .
real nice !
nicer than you , condom carrier !
dump the bag , you &apos;re guilty !
no !
oh , lord , he &apos;s thrown a clot !
pierce ! call 911 !
no ! no ! no !
pierce , you didn &apos;t need to do that .
yes , i did .
all you guys do is talk ,
leaving me to do the things you won &apos;t do .
people like you are the reason
we took so long to get into vietnam .
is this what you were trying to hide , shirley ?
a pregnancy test ?
and more importantly ,
are they seriously marketing pregnancy tests to black women
guys ! this is a terribly childish way
o handle this kind of situation .
does this means you have a new boyfriend ?
who , who , who ?
not that it &apos;s , uh , anyone &apos;s business ...
i recently reconnected with my husband over labor day ,
and it seems the lord may have a plan for us
that doesn &apos;t include that stripper slut he ran away with .
you &apos;re not pregnant , shirley . it &apos;s impossible .
why does everybody think i &apos;m old ?
i &apos;m around jeff &apos;s age !
i have a uterus !
no , no . according to my charts ,
you couldn &apos;t have concived over labor day weekend .
you would have been ovulating on halloween .
which is just as well ,
because if you &apos;re gonna have a pregnant woman in one of these ,
i say go elevator labor or go home .
halloween ?
well , that &apos;s that , then .
yeah , what a relief .
looks like someone narrowly avoid
a &quot; lifestyle mistake &quot; of their own .
oh ! or is it only bad if you sleep with unmarried men ?
the bible doesn &apos;t recognize divorce , britta !
when you marry a man , he &apos;s your man !
yeah , and after he marries someone else ,
if you jump into the sac with him , you &apos;re an angel ,
so long as you don &apos;t use protection ?
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re enjoying this .
and i hope whoever stole that pen enjoys it in hell !
nice try , stephen fry .
&quot; stephen fry . &quot;
we all have an agreement .
nobody leaves till we find it .
get off.here we go .
we are gonna find that pen !
we are gonna find that pen !
and if we can &apos;t find it ,
our children will find it !
is it over here in the books ?
this pen ? this incredible , magical pen
that nobody knows how it could disappear ?
oh , maybe it &apos;s right in here !
guys , this is school property !
can we just forget it ?
it &apos;s a pen !
it &apos;s a pen now ?
really ?
it &apos;s not a prciple anymore ?
now it &apos;s a pen ?
why you change your heart ?
you &apos;re not seriously accusing me .
we searched my bag !
which is exactly the last place you &apos;d put it ,
if you found it halfway through all this .
in fact , assuming that one of us does have the pen ,
who among us has the most incentive
to make sure it never sees the light of day ?
you want to go there ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll go there .
okay .
i was born there .
really ?
there &apos;s a placard the commemorating me !
what &apos;s going on , and how can i help ?
annie , relax .
no , you relax , jeff .
or are you scared that if you do , my pen will fall out ?
you precocious little bitch !
okay , guys , guys ! hey !
guys , stop !
you &apos;re being complely illogical !
we need to flip up the table , divide the group by gender ,
and then search each other in our underwear .
what ?
now what ?
everybody shake . enough to dislodge .
okay , anything hit the floor ?
no .
what are those underwear made out of ?
they look luxurious .
oh . they &apos;re an organic soy @-@ cotton blend .
this gwynnifer must be real special .
don &apos;you usually wear
the stripey turquoise beetlejuice numbers ?
what does she mean &quot; usually &quot; ?
all right , end of the road .
we &apos;ve torn apart the room ,
we &apos;ve stripped .
there is absolutely no place left ...
no .
no !
no .
noooooo ! no !
damn it . broke my scissors .
here . be careful .
this is the last pair we have .
also , don &apos;t cut his legs .
i &apos;m worried we &apos;ve gone too far .
this is how super villains are created .
can &apos;t you just make an inspiring winger speech about trust ,
throw in a few digs at an easy celebrity target ,
and put a ribbon on this thing ?
abed , think about this for one second ,
if a single one of us leaves this room
before we find that pen ,
how can any of us trust anyone in this group ever again ?
what &apos;s your hurry ?
i &apos;m clothing myself .
i &apos;m not comfortable standing around in my all @-@ together
like you two anorex jeze--
oh ! i &apos;m so sorry .
that was really mean .
i don &apos;t know where that came from .
we &apos;ve all been through a lot today .
and i &apos;m sure this pregnancy scares
been weighg on you all week , right ?
and maybe that &apos;s why you took my pen ?
what ? !
where are you hiding it , judgy beans ?
all right , here we go .
it smells like a waffle house sink !
pierce , are you using slim jims to scratch your legs ?
have we not gotten to a place free of judgment yet ?
this isn &apos;t it , this isn &apos;t it .
where is it ? where &apos;s the pen ?
where &apos;s the pen ? !
where &apos;s the pen ?
it &apos;s getting a little chilly outside ,
so the animal wranglers have asked that every student
pick up a puppy and hold it ,
so they stay warm while the volunteers
hand out tiny , puppsized hats .
honestly , i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m even making these announcements .
there can &apos;t be anyone who isn &apos;t already on the quad !
annie , i &apos;d just like to say ,
on behalf of whoever actually stole this pen
i real am sorry about all this .
i knew it was you .
i knew it was you .
all i know is it could be any of you .
and for all we know , it &apos;s you .
i wish it were . i really do .
i wish i could just find it behind my ear .
i &apos;d rather be that stupid than think that anyone of us
might be this inconsiderate .
after all we &apos;ve been through , it almost seems impossible .
it seems less than impossible .
something impossible
actual seems more likely .
here we go .
winger speech to take us home .
what if a ghost took the pen ?
let him finish
i finished .
for real , honestly , seriously , why not ?
why not just &quot; a ghost took the pen &quot; ?
okay , i &apos;ve been saying that for hours .
and we should &apos;ve listening to troy from the beginning .
guys , look in your hearts
and answer this question honestly :
what &apos;s more likely ?
that someone in this group doesn &apos;t belong in this group ?
or ghosts ?
if we have to choose between turning on each other
or pinning it on some specter
with unfinished , pen @-@ related business ,
i &apos;m sorry , but my money &apos;s on ghost .
well , i &apos;m not a religious person ,
but i &apos;ve seen specials on the paranormal .
anything &apos;s possible .
relative to the alternative ,
it actually seems more logical to me .
why would a ghost want a pen ?
troy .
okay .
so i see it as a lot like the movie paranormal activity ,
except for more boring and fancy .
and i think in 1856,
it is possible that a man was beheaded
while he was writing in his diary
to his long lost love ,
and now he roams the halls of greendale
screaming for his pen so he can write a love letter .
&quot; i need her ! i need her ! &quot; he screams ,
as he looks for a pen .
what the hell did you people do in there ?
something you and your puppies could only dream of
you non @-@ miraculous son of a bitch .
non @-@ miraculous ?
wait ! abed !
now who could resist falling in love with our float .
this autumn @-@ colored puppy reminds us that
while the leaves might be changing ,
responsible pet ownship is always in season .
oh , here is a crowned favorite ,
and top and tail flute .
a champagne bath and a red sportscar ,
let &apos;s hope he &apos; s single .
well , this one feels a little preachy .
