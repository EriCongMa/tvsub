come in.i &apos;ve been waiting for you .
hi , i just ... oh , my god ! monica ! oh , my god !
i &apos;m sorry ! i was i was taking a nap .
since when do you take naps in that position ?
tell me you were waiting for a guy . please tell me .
yes , i was . a guy.from work .
i &apos;m seeing a guy from work !
that cute waiter guy that looks like a nonthreatening ray liotta ?
that one !
give me a second . i &apos;m just going to grab a jacket .
when i get back , i want every little detail .
maybe that &apos;s him .
okey , maybe
it &apos;s just joey and ross .
why aren &apos;t you at the movie ?
ross was so loud , they threw us out .
i had to talk loud because the movie was loud !
he &apos;s talking to london .
why ? did he get in touch with emily ?
no , not yet . he &apos;s hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her .
i don &apos;t care if i said some other girl &apos;s name , you prissy old twit !
way to suck up to the family !
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re all here . my office finally got wrinkle @-@ free fax paper !
the one where phoebe hates pbs
hi , is this nanny hopkins ? i &apos;m looking for emily .
waltham .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . is this 0 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 7 @-@ 4 @-@ 2 @-@ 9 @-@ 3 @-@ 4 @-@ 7 @-@ 4 @-@ 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 7 ?
oh , it &apos;s &quot; 4 @-@ 3 , &quot; not 4 @-@ 2.well , which 4 @-@ 2 ?
no , no ! vomit tux !
don &apos;t worry , i had it dry @-@ cleaned .
vomit tux ? who vomited on ?
you know what ? what you up to , joe ?
they &apos;re doing this telethon thing on tv .
and my agent got me a job as cohost !
that &apos;s great !
a little good deed for pbs , plus some tv exposure .
that &apos;s the kind of math joey likes to do .
oh , pbs !
what &apos;s wrong with pbs ?
what &apos;s right with them ?
why don &apos;t you like pbs ?
right after my mom killed herself , i was in a bad place , personally .
i thought i &apos;d write to sesame street .
because they were nice when i was a little kid .
no one ever wrote back .
a lot of those muppets don &apos;t have thumbs .
all i got was a lousy key chain , and by that time , i was living in a box .
i didn &apos;t have keys !
i &apos;m sorry , phoebe.i wanted to do a good deed
like you did with the babies .
this isn &apos;t a good deed . you just want to get on tv . this is selfish .
what about you having those babies for your brother ? that &apos;s selfish !
what are you talking about ?
it was a nice thing , but it made you feel good , right ?
yeah , so ?
it made you feel good so that makes it selfish .
look , there &apos;s no unselfish good deeds . sorry .
yes , there are totally good deeds that are selfless !
may i ask for one example ?
yeah , it &apos;s you know , there &apos;s ... no , you may not !
because all people are selfish .
are you calling me selfish ?
are you calling you people ?
sorry to burst that bubble , phoebe ,
but selfless good deeds don &apos;t exist .
you know the deal on santa claus ?
i &apos;ll find a selfless good deed . i &apos;m going to beat you , you evil genius !
hello
hello ross ?
oh , my god ! it &apos;s emily ! it &apos;s emily , everyone !
hi
i &apos;m only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives . goodbye .
you can hang up , but i &apos;ll keep calling everyone in england ...
... if that &apos;s what it takes to get you to talk to me .
really ? about what ?
look , you &apos;re my wife . we &apos;re married .
you know , i love you.i really miss you .
i miss you too .
at least , i think i do .
she &apos;s talking .
when you said &quot; the deal with santa , &quot; you meant ... ?
that he doesn &apos;t exist .
right .
chandler , have you heard about monica &apos;s secret boyfriend ?
yeah , she might have mentioned him .
so , mon , when are we going to meet this new , secret waiter man ?
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s up to meeting everyone yet .
yeah , i don &apos;t think he &apos;s up to it .
i want to meet this guy who &apos;s the best sex she ever had .
really ?
that &apos;s what you heard ? you said that ?
i might have .
why is that funny ?
because i &apos;m very happy for him .
and you ! you lucky dog !
hi ! -hey
well , emily &apos;s willing to work on the relationship .
that &apos;s great ! in london .
what ?
she wants me to move to london .
but you live here .
you know that .
what will you do ?
i don &apos;t know.i mean , i can &apos;t leave ben .
you can just video @-@ conference with him .
i &apos;m not ready to have a child .
i bet if i talked to carol and susan ... i could convince them to move to london with ben .
i &apos;m sure your ex @-@ wife would be more than happy to move ... so you can patch things up with your new wife .
it could happen .
ross , we are not moving to london . we already have lives here .
but it &apos;d be great .
they have great theater ... great accents.tea.
they have a queen .
so ?
she &apos;s a woman .
daddy ! -hey !
guess what ? we &apos;re moving to london !
who &apos;s going to london ?
nobody &apos;s going to london .
welcome to london , governor .
right , right . it &apos;ll be great because we &apos;ll have big ben and little ben in the same city .
go pack !
see ? see , he wants to go .
yeah , we leave all our big decisions to the 3 @-@ year @-@ old .
come on , come on . it &apos;ll be just like three &apos;s company ...
... only there &apos;s a kid and my wife ...
... and you &apos;re the gay ones .
how you doing ? welcome . good to see you .
this &apos;ll be your phone .
that &apos;s great.but i &apos;m not really expecting a lot of calls .
no , you answer it and take pledges .
but i &apos;m the host .
gary collins is the host . you &apos;ll be answering the phone .
you don &apos;t seem to understand . i was dr. drake ramoray .
well , here &apos;s your phone , doctor .
i can &apos;t believe i can &apos;t find a selfless good deed .
you know that old guy that lives next to me ?
i snuck over there
and raked up the leaves on his front stoop .
but he caught me , and he force @-@ fed me cider and cookies .
then i felt wonderful . that old jackass !
maybe joey &apos;s right . maybe all good deeds are selfish .
i will find a selfless good deed .
i gave birth to three children ...
... and i won &apos;t let them be raised in a world where joey &apos;s right !
monica
can i ask you a cooking question ?
sure
if you &apos;re cooking on the stove ...
... that means your new boyfriend is better in bed than richard ?
chandler
is he ?
i think i &apos;ll respect the privacy of my new , secret boyfriend .
why ?
if this guy was me ... and it &apos;s me who &apos;d learned that it was me who was the best you &apos;d ever had ...
... i &apos;d be like this :
all right , emily.as much as i love you i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t move to london without ben .
i understand that would be difficult .
would you consider moving here ?
you were moving here anyway.why can &apos;t you just do that ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just
but i know that even though i &apos;ve been a complete idiot up till now ...
... you have to come here.you have to , so we can work this out together .
all right .
did you just say &quot; all right &quot; ?
i did . now i &apos;m the idiot .
emily , that is so great ! it &apos;ll be great ! we &apos;re going to be like two idiots in love !
there &apos;s one thing that really scares me still .
yes , tell me .
you must understand ... how humiliating it was for me at the altar in front of my family and friends .
i know . i am so sorry .
and then , after deciding to forgive you seeing you at the airport , catching our plane with her .
again , very sorry .
i mean , i can &apos;t be in the same room as her .
it drives me mad thinking of you being in the same room as her .
emily , there is nothing between rachel and me.i love you .
all right .
i &apos;ll come to new york , and we &apos;ll try to make this work .
that &apos;s so great !
as long as you don &apos;t see rachel anymore .
i asked emily if she would come to new york.and she said yes .
great !
no no no
only if i promise never to see rachel again .
what ? you can &apos;t
what did you say ?
i &apos;d think about it . how am l supposed to make this decision ?
i &apos;m actually asking you !
well , you can &apos;t just not see rachel anymore.she is one of your best friends .
yeah ! but , he can &apos;t not exactly see emily.i mean that &apos;s his wife !
that &apos;s true !
yeah , but you &apos;ve known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life .
that &apos;s true !
thanks for the help . problem solved !
hello ! -hi , monica
oh hey joey ! we &apos;ve been watching all day , when will you be on tv ?
there was kind of a mix @-@ up in my agent &apos;s office ... but i &apos;m still on tv , and that &apos;s good exposure .
you &apos;re not on tv .
how about now ?
there he is !
hello , new york !
maybe just put the whole duck in there . who cares ?
now i got the legs .
how many times have i told you to never watch the cooking channel ?
hi , chandler.-hi.
i need that broiling pan that joey borrowed .
that was yours ?
we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars .
williams @-@ sonoma , fall catalog , page 27 .
expect it in 4 to 6 weeks .
joey &apos;s at the telethon for the rest of the day .
we have the place to ourselves .
yeah , so ?
maybe you &apos;d want to book some time with &quot; the best you &apos;ve ever had . &quot;
you know what , champ ? i think i &apos;ll pass .
why ?
why ?
what &apos;s your point ?
with all the stupid gloating , would you want to sleep with you ?
well , i think i &apos;d be a little out of my league , but i &apos;d give it a shot .
pbs telethon .
i just wanted to let you know that i found a selfless good deed .
i went down to the park and i let a bee sting me .
what good is that going to do ?
it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends .
the bee is happy , and i am definitely not .
you know , the bee probably died after he stung you .
damn it !
back on in 30 seconds , people !
excuse me , would you mind switching with me ?
no way . i &apos;m in the shot , man .
you &apos;ve been here all day !
i &apos;m taking pledges .
and we &apos;re on three , two ....
welcome back to our fall telethon .
if you &apos;ve been enjoying cirque du soleil ...
... and you &apos;d like to see more , it &apos;s very simple .
all you have to do is call in a pledge ... and tell one of our volunteers
what type of programming you
quick broiling pan question
yes , it really does cost that much .
maybe next time your duck can puke in something from pottery barn .
that &apos;s it .
i cannot make this decision .
it is too difficult .
i leave it entirely up to the gods of fate .
a magic 8 ball ?
you can &apos;t be serious , you can &apos;t make this decision with a toy !
it &apos;s not a toy .
i don &apos;t know what else to do !
i either keep my wife and lose one of my best friends ...
... or i get divorced for the second time before i &apos;m 30 .
if anyone else has a better suggestion , let &apos;s hear it .
because i got nothing !
don &apos;t be shy.any suggestion will do .
okay , then .
here we go .
magic 8 ball ... should i never see rachel again ?
&quot; ask again later . &quot;
later is not good enough !
&quot; ask again later . &quot;
what the hell ? this is broken ! it is broken !
let me see .
will chandler have sex tonight ?
&quot; don &apos;t count on lt . &quot;
seems like it works to me .
okay , one more time .
should i never see rachel again ?
magic 8 ball ! what did you ask ?
does ... rachel get to pick the movie that we &apos;re all going to see tonight ?
excellent . what &apos;s the answer ?
looks like stella &apos;s gonna get her groove back tonight !
what ? i heard it was good .
pbs telethon .
hi , joey .
hey , phoebe .
i &apos;d like to make a pledge .
i would like to donate $ 200 .
two hundred dollars ?
you sure ? after what sesame street did to you ?
i &apos;m still mad at them ,
but they bring happiness to lots of kids whose moms didn &apos;t kill themselves .
by supporting them , i &apos;m doing a good thing ,
but i &apos;m not happy about it .
so there ! a selfless good deed .
you don &apos;t feel good about donating the money ?
no , it sucks ! i was saving up to buy a hamster .
a hamster ? those things are , like , $ 10 .
not the one i had my eye on .
it looks like we have surpassed last year &apos;s pledge total.thank you !
and the pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers .
oh , boy ! and may i say , one of our sharpest dressed volunteers .
mr. joseph tribbiani !
oh , look ! joey &apos;s on tv !
isn &apos;t that great ?
my pledge got joey on tv !
that makes me feel so ... oh , no !
look ... maybe i got carried away before ,
but there &apos;s something you got to know .
if i &apos;m the best , it &apos;s only because you made me the best .
keep talking .
i was nothing before you .
call the other girls and ask .
which wouldn &apos;t take long .
but when i &apos;m with you , and we &apos;re together ...
... oh , my god !
really ?
oh , my god !
i understand if you never want to sleep with me again .
but that would be wrong .
we &apos;re too good.we owe it to sex !
if we owe it !
oh , my !
when will joey be home ?
i was kind of hoping we could do this without him .
no , no , no ! leave the gloves on .
i cleaned the bathroom .
why don &apos;t we lose the gloves .
all right . let &apos;s show them how it &apos;s done.okey
you know that wasn &apos;t part of it ?
i know .
you ready ? we &apos;re going to be late .
for what ?
for stella , remember ?
she &apos;s getting her groove back in 20 minutes .
i totally forgot about that .
can i take a rain check ? i &apos;m waiting for a call from emily .
sure , i guess .
i hear you don &apos;t have to go to london .
it &apos;s not that easy . there &apos;s still a lot of relationship stuff .
like what ?
just stuff .
you know , kind of what emily wants .
talk to me . maybe i can help .
no , no , you can &apos;t help .
i have to do this without your help .
i know you can do that too .
i &apos;m just saying if you need to talk ....
thanks .
ross
whatever it is that emily wants ... just give it to her .
the bottom line is that you love her .
fix whatever she wants fixed .
just do it .
you &apos;re going to have to try .
you &apos;ll hate yourself if you don &apos;t .
come on , answer it !
hi , sweetie .
good .
yes , i &apos;ve been thinking ... about that thing you wanted me to do .
i can do it .
will you come to new york ?
