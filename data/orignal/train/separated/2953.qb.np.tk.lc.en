you know you want it to happen as much as i do .
i want you . i need you .
let me make love to you .
i don &apos;t wanna stand in the way of true love or anything ..
but i think a cantaloupe might hurt less .
no , i &apos;m rehearsing my lines .
they &apos;re giving me a romantic story on days of our lives .
it &apos;s the first time my character &apos;s gotten one . i &apos;m nervous . i want it to be good .
i haven &apos;t seen you this worked @-@ up since you did that dog @-@ food commercial ..
and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog .
yeah , that was a disappointment .
you wanna come down to the set and tell me if i &apos;m doing okay ?
are you serious ?
yeah .
you just have to promise not to get thrown out again .
that was an honest mistake .
right .
&quot; oh , my god . is this the men &apos;s room ? i feel so foolish .
have you always known you wanted to be an actor ? &quot;
yeah , that was an awesome day .
the.one.with.rachels.dream

well , you can &apos;t .
we &apos;re booked solid for the next month .
well , i can &apos;t give you a massage ..
because my license has been revoked again .
phoebe , what happened ?
well , it was an accident , you know .
it &apos;s a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips .
so the restaurant &apos;s doing well , you say ?
it is so great . there are people lining up in the street ..
to taste my food . saturday , there &apos;s a waiting list of 50 people .
i know how that feels .
last semester , i had two students .. who wanted to take my 1 : 00 class , but it was full .
so they had to take my 5 : 00 .
that &apos;s not the same .
have i got a surprise for you . pack your bags .
oh , no . you guys aren &apos;t supposed to get divorced for seven years .

honey , i can &apos;t .
things are crazy at the restaurant .
you &apos;re really that busy ?
yeah . i &apos;m sorry , i really am .
that &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll just try and reschedule .
hi , this is chandler bing . i made a reservation there ..
and i need to change it .
what do you mean , it &apos;s nonrefundable ? well , can i just come some other time ?
can &apos;t you make an exception ?
tell them i &apos;m a chef at a big new york restaurant .
tell them that in two weeks , i will once again be a masseuse in good standing .
look , this is ridiculous . i &apos;m not paying for that room , okay ?
well , thank you very much .
yeah , i &apos;m going to vermont .
don &apos;t worry , use your travel insurance .
i don &apos;t have travel insurance .
well , this is what happens when people live on the edge .
honey , what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;ll go .
okay , i &apos;ll pick you up at 10 .
oh , go with you ?
oh , i can &apos;t go .
why don &apos;t you take ross ?
don &apos;t you think that &apos;ll be a little weird ? i mean , two guys in a romantic inn ?
no , not if the room has two beds .
i guess .
it still seems a little .. &quot; moonlight boat ride &quot; ? !
joey , is this the bed where olivia lost her virginity ?
i don &apos;t know , but one of the extras sure did .
listen , rach . thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes .
please , honey . just the fact that you want me here to support you , i &apos;m ..
oh , my god . is that christian saunders ? he is so gorgeous !

joey ? joey , we &apos;re ready for you .
okay . all right , wish me luck .
okay . not that you need it , but good .. god ! is that chase lassiter ?
he &apos;s straight , right ?
rach , if you weren &apos;t here wondering ..

i &apos;m sorry , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry . good luck .
on a bell , please . quietly .
and action !
drake , what are you doing here ?
stopping you from marrying the wrong man ..
and making the biggest mistake of your life .
get out .
you don &apos;t love him .
what do you know about love ?
i know what i felt that night when we kissed under the bridge .
that kiss never happened .
well , what about this one ?
now , i told you to get out .
fine , i &apos;ll go .
but let me ask you one question .
you look real familiar . have we .. ?
shh ! he &apos;s asking her a question .
can you live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been ?
i don &apos;t have a choice .
yes , you do .
yes , you do . i &apos;m the one who doesn &apos;t have a choice because i ..
because i can &apos;t stop loving you .
don &apos;t say that .
tell me to stop .
just ..
tell me to stop .
cut !
no !
or , cut . you know , that &apos;s your call .
everything was delicious .
thank you .
it was . the duck in particular was superb .
thank you .
you haven &apos;t said anything .
actually , i do have one small complaint .
well , please , i welcome criticism .
the musician right outside the restaurant is kind of a mood killer .
what musician ?
what are you doing here ?
you said you had customers lined up in the street , so i &apos;m here to entertain .
great .
yeah , it really has been great too .
they must have seen me play before ..
because they requested a bunch of my songs .
yeah , &quot; you suck .. &quot;
and &quot; shut up and go home . &quot;
listen , phoebe . you know how much i love listening to your music ..
but ..
but what ?
this is kind of a classy place .
okay , say no more .
everyone !
classy , huh ?
hi , chandler bing . i have a reservation .
welcome to the chestnut lnn . where are you joining us from ?
new york .
the big apple .
he &apos;s wound up . we had to stop at every maple @-@ candy stand on the way here .
i ate all my gifts for everybody .
i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s no record of your reservation in the computer .
that &apos;s impossible . check again , please .
check again , please .
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s not here .
it &apos;s not there .
let me get this straight . i called to try to cancel my reservation ..
was told it &apos;s not refundable . then we drove six hours all the way up here ..
and now we don &apos;t have a reservation ?
i don &apos;t know what to say .
she doesn &apos;t know what to say .
just give us the cheapest room you have .
the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite . the rate is $ 600 .
that &apos;s insane .
it &apos;s totally insane .
dude , let &apos;s drive home . we &apos;ll hit all the maple @-@ candy stores on the way back ..
and if they &apos;re closed , then maybe we &apos;ll tap a tree and make some ourselves .
does that room have a closet i can lock him in ?
we &apos;ll take it .
great .
they are totally ripping us off ! three hundred dollars each ?
&quot; each ? &quot; i &apos;m your date .
so i pay for everything and have no sex .
oh , life before monica .
dude , don &apos;t worry about it .
i know how to make your money back . this is a nice hotel . plenty of amenities .
we just load up on those . like those apples . instead of taking one ..
i take six .
great . at $ 100 an apple , we &apos;re there .
come on , you get the idea . you know , we &apos;ll make our money back in no time .
dude , you &apos;re shaking .
it &apos;s the sugar . could you hold the apple ?
hi .
hey .
joey , i gotta tell you , i have been thinking all day about that scene you did .
i mean , you were amazing .
you know , the writing was good . and the director &apos;s good .
and my costar &apos;s good .
but they &apos;re not as good as me !
you have to tell me what happens tomorrow .
i &apos;m going over the script now . wanna read lines with me ?
me ? oh , i &apos;m not an actress .
all right , i can ask monica .
screw her ! that part is mine !
okay , so just from the top of the page right here .
okay .
hello , drake . i &apos;m surprised to see you here .
i can &apos;t believe you married him .
well , what choice did i have ?
he was keeping my sister in a dungeon .
so , what about us ? everything we feel for each other ?
it &apos;s over . you have to accept that .
how can i , knowing i &apos;ll never hold you in my arms again ..
or touch your skin or feel your lips ..
knowing i &apos;ll never make love to you ?
how can i accept that i can never kiss you again ..
when it &apos;s all i can do not to kiss you right now ?
kiss me .
what ?
kiss me .
rach , it doesn &apos;t say that .
no , i &apos;m saying it .
but ..
just don &apos;t talk .
well , that &apos;s new .
hi , this is ross geller in suite 206 .
i &apos;ve forgotten a couple of things .
could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room ?
thank you . okay , a toothbrush , toothpaste ..
razor , mouthwash , deodorant , floss , band @-@ aids , shaving cream , after @-@ shave .
and i feel like i &apos;m forgetting something .
is there anything else you have that i haven &apos;t asked for already ?
yeah , go ahead , send up some tampons .
what &apos;d you get ?
usa today .
nice . put it with the others .
and i also got two more apples .
we &apos;re four short of a bushel !
god , i feel so alive . i love being in the country !
also , got these great salt and pepper shakers ..
from the restaurant .
that &apos;s not cool .
dude , none of this is cool .
look , chandler , you have to find the line between stealing ..
and taking what the hotel owes you .
for example : a hair dryer , no , no .
but shampoos and conditioners , yes , yes .
now , the salt shaker is off limits .
but the salt ..
i wish i &apos;d thought this through .
i think i get what you mean , though . like , the lamp is the hotel &apos;s ..
but the bulbs .. oh , you already got that .
not my first time in a hotel , my friend .
okay , how about this ?
no , no , no .
you can &apos;t take the remote control .
yes , but the batteries .
thank you . thank you very much .
let &apos;s celebrate with some maple candy .
no !
at least tell me where you hid it .
can i ask you a question ?
yeah .
have you ever had any ..
weird , romantic dreams ?
let me think .
when i was younger , i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese .
and on our wedding night , i ate his head .
okay .
well , this is like that ..
in no way .
i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey .
wow ! you mean like &quot; kiss him &quot; kiss him ?
oh , yeah . i mean , it was pretty intense .
what brought that on ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe it had to do with the fact i saw him do a love scene .
a love scene ? with who ?
olivia .
olivia ? ! i thought she was marrying connor ? !
oh , right . real life more important .
you think my dream means anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , you saw him do a love scene .
so maybe you don &apos;t have a thing for joey . maybe you have a thing for drake .
well , it was joey reading drake &apos;s lines in the dream .
of course it was . trust me , when it comes to psychology ..
i know what i &apos;m talking about .
i took two psych classes in college .
you took the same class twice .
it was hard !
i know .
hey .
hi , phoebe .
here , monica , look what i got to wear when i play at your restaurant .
wait .
right ? i think this might even class up &quot; the ballad of the uncircumcised man . &quot;
phoebe ..
maybe i wasn &apos;t clear before .
i really love listening to your music here .
but my restaurant , it &apos;s sort of an upscale place .
right , yeah , okay . i &apos;ll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault .
phoebe , it &apos;s not what you wear .
it &apos;s sort of your songs .
i just don &apos;t think you should play at the restaurant anymore .
okay . fine , i &apos;ll just ..
i &apos;ll take the hat back .
there .
hey , so , you guys , the funniest thing happened at work the ..
my songs aren &apos;t good enough for your restaurant ?
okay , we &apos;re still on that .
i didn &apos;t say they weren &apos;t good enough .
then what &apos;s wrong with them ?
what , they don &apos;t go with your tiny portions of pretentious food ?
tiny portions ?
yeah , well , &quot; excuse me .
i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer , but i can &apos;t see it . i can &apos;t see it . &quot;
phoebe , it &apos;s not about quantity .
well , it &apos;s not about quality .
oh , really ? you wanna talk about quality ?
have you ever heard of a &quot; key &quot; ? it &apos;s what some people sing in .
well , at least all my songs don &apos;t taste like garlic .
yeah , there are other ingredients , monica .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
when i &apos;m in a coffeehouse bopping along to one of your songs ..
i &apos;m wearing earplugs .
earplugs or cloves of garlic ?
you know what ? i take back what i said before .
keep playing at the restaurant , because with your music driving people inside ..
my bar sales have gone up like crazy .
what are people having , the garlic martini ?
so you wanna hear my work story ?
i &apos;ll save it .
here &apos;s your bill . we hope you enjoyed your stay .
oh , we did . and you still have all your lamps .
i didn &apos;t factor in the room tax .
dude , don &apos;t worry about it .
i found an unattended maid &apos;s cart . we &apos;re way ahead of the game .
oh , my god .
what ?
there &apos;s something new in the bowl .
look , we have enough . just walk away .
no , but i want the pine cones .
there &apos;s a forest right outside .
it &apos;s not the same .
no , look . she &apos;s gonna see us .
no , she won &apos;t . i &apos;m sly .
okay , go quick .
thank you for a delightful stay .
my maple candy !
it &apos;s just you . i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall .
you &apos;d better get back in that kitchen . the garlic &apos;s not gonna overuse itself .
okay , you have to stop playing now .
why ?
the only person my playing is bothering is you .
oh , yeah ? let &apos;s settle this . come on .
get your garlic peelers off me .
excuse me ? excuse me ?
hi , i &apos;m monica geller . i &apos;m the head chef here .
okay , i was actually expecting a little applause there , but whatever .
quick question . by a show of hands ..
how many of you were bothered by this woman &apos;s singing outside ?
okay , okay . well , i have a question .
you can put your hand down .
you made your point earlier when you spit in my guitar case .
okay , okay . how many of you enjoyed the music outside ?
let me ask you this question . how many thought the music was fine ..
but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant ?
okay , well , who identified this restaurant &apos;s tone as &quot; pretentious @-@ comma @-@ garlicky &quot; ?
okay , who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretension never hurt anyone ?
okay , well , all right , who thinks the food is fine , the music was fine ..
but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll @-@ taking ?
excuse us .
all right , here &apos;s a question .
who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy ..
that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music ..
and feels really bad about it now ?
well , who was so stupid and stubborn ..
that she lashed out against her friend &apos;s cooking ..
which she actually thinks is pretty great ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry too .
hey , you wanna stick around and i &apos;ll whip you up some dinner ?
yeah , as long as it &apos;s free .
the food here is ridiculously overpr ..
who hopes the hand @-@ raising thing is still cute enough that you won &apos;t hate me ?
hey .
hey .
joey , do you have peanut butter on the back of your head ?
oh , man . i thought i got it all .
how .. ?
how ?
i was making a peanut butter smoothie , right ?
i couldn &apos;t find this little plastic thingy that goes in the top of the blender .
and i thought , &quot; well , you know , how important can that be ? &quot; right ?
turns out , very .
wow , definitely just drake .
what ?
how &apos;s it going with drake ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s going very well .
what ?
that scene i saw was so good .
well , i &apos;m feeling really insecure about the one we &apos;re shooting tomorrow .
is this that thing you do when you say you &apos;re bad so i &apos;ll give you a compliment ?
a little .
no , i really am worried . i have to make it convincing that i &apos;m in love with olivia .
so ?
so i &apos;ve never played that .
oh , honey , it can &apos;t be that hard . i mean , you &apos;ve been in love before .
well , just once ..
with you .
okay . well , this could be a little awkward .
i &apos;m just gonna blow past it .
well , look , can &apos;t you just use that method @-@ actor thing ..
where you use your real @-@ life memories to help you in your performance ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
all right , look , just try to remember how you felt when you were in love ..
and think about that when you &apos;re playing the scene .
okay . yeah , i think i can do that .
yeah . okay , there &apos;s this party scene coming up .
and olivia and her husband are there ..
and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her , but he can &apos;t .
that makes me think about those times i wanted to grab you and kiss you ..
but you didn &apos;t know , so i would just pretend everything was cool ..
but really it was killing me .
joey , you never talked about that before .
hey , you know what else i could use ?
there &apos;s this scene where drake sneaks into olivia &apos;s bedroom ..
and she doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s there , which never happened with us .
i mean , he knows he shouldn &apos;t be there , but he just wants to look at her .
you know ?
and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your makeup ..
when i would think to myself , &quot; my god , she is beautiful . &quot;
and it hurt so much because i knew i could never tell you .
but it was worth it just to be there looking at you .
thanks , dude . this is great !
i got you something from vermont .
besides tampons and salt ?
oh , my god .
maple candy . that &apos;s so sweet of you .
that &apos;s weird , it &apos;s empty .
hi , you guys . what &apos;s going on ? you guys wanna hang out or .. ?
