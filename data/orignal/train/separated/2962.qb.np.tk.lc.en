i &apos;ve never given her a cookie .
have you ?
no .
no . and for the record , i &apos;ve also never given her frosting from a can .
hey , rach , the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation ..
and we wondered if you would write one for us ?
of course . i would be honored .
thank you .
i think there &apos;s been an oversight .
we would have asked you . we thought you wouldn &apos;t be interested .
it &apos;s just that we don &apos;t think of you as really being so much with the words .
clearly , we were wrong .
i got a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys , okay ?
i know how much you want to have a baby ..
and i would love to help you get one .
you know what ? then we want you to do it .

so no matter where we go , i &apos;m wearing something fancy ..
i &apos;m gonna put on my finest jewelry ..
and we &apos;re gonna have sex in a public restroom .
you guys do that ?
chandler won &apos;t even have sex in our bathroom .
that &apos;s where people make number two .
the.one.where.rachel &apos;s.sister.babysits
so , you know , i have a little time if you want to ..
i &apos;d love to , but i really have to grade these papers .

hey , your english is getting better .
oh , my god .
i know .
she may be the hottest girl i &apos;ve ever hated .
what you working on ?
monica and chandler &apos;s recommendation .
i want it to sound smart , but i don &apos;t know any big words or anything .
why don &apos;t you use your thesaurus ?
what did i just say ?
watch .
here , highlight the word you want to change , go under &quot; tools .. &quot;
and the thesaurus generates .. gives .
gives a whole list of choices .
you can pick the word that sounds smartest .
my god , that &apos;s great . i &apos;m smart .
no , no , i &apos;m :
&quot; brainy , bright , clever . &quot; i love this thing !
look out , ladies ! joey tribbiani &apos;s got the whole package !
god ..
so beautiful .
i know , isn &apos;t she ?
no , i was talking about your bedding .
all right , what &apos;s your news , amy ?
well ..
i &apos;m getting married .
wow ! oh , my god !
to who ?
this guy .
he has a killer apartment .
and .. ?
and it &apos;s on fifth .
and the elevator opens up right into the living room .
no , what &apos;s he like ?
oh , he &apos;s okay .
do you remember my old boyfriend mark ?
yeah .
it &apos;s his dad .
wow , so he &apos;s gotta be ..
old ? yeah .
but he travels a lot , so he &apos;s hardly ever there .
sweetie , i gotta tell you , it sounds a little bit like .. you like the apartment
more than you like ..
myron .
yeah , i told you he was old .
sit down . sit down .
honey , you know ..
i once also almost married somebody that i didn &apos;t love .
do you remember barry ?
remember him ?
god , we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep .
sometimes just nodding is okay .
but anyway , listen .
not marrying barry was the best decision that i ever , ever made .
honey , amy , you deserve true love . your soul mate is out there somewhere .
someone that is your age , that is smart , that is fun ..
and that you care about .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m gonna do it .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna marry myron and keep looking for mr. right .
okay , let &apos;s keep talking .
excuse me . anniversary .
excuse me . anniversary .
sir , could you move your nachos ? they &apos;re in my seat .
it &apos;s my anniversary .
here we are .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s been a whole year .
i know .
this has been the best year ..
this has been the best year of my life !
me too !
i never thought i could love someone this much !
i feel the same way !
you &apos;re so generous and kind , and you &apos;re amazing in bed !
it &apos;s our anniversary .
knicks fans , please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard .
someone has a special question to ask .
how lame . it &apos;s so tacky and impersonal .
really ?
it &apos;s the worst way to propose .
excuse me .
i finished my recommendation . here .
and i think you &apos;ll be very , very happy .
it &apos;s the longest i ever spent on a computer without looking at porn .
i don &apos;t understand .
some of the words a little too sophisticated for you ?
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
well , of course it does . it &apos;s smart . i used a thesaurus .
on every word ?
yep .
all right , what was this sentence originally ?
&quot; they are warm , nice people with big hearts . &quot;
and that became , &quot; they are humid , prepossessing homo sapiens ..
with full @-@ sized aortic pumps . &quot;
yeah . yeah . and hey , i really mean it , dude .
all right , joey , i don &apos;t think we can use this .
why not ?
well , because you signed it :
&quot; baby kangaroo tribbiani . &quot;
why don &apos;t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself .
you don &apos;t need a thesaurus . just write from here .
your full @-@ sized aortic pump .
amy . hi .
i took your advice .
i left myron .
good for you !
i know . i &apos;m erin brockovich .
yes , you are .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
thank you .
so can i stay with you ?
but erin brockovich had her own house .
look who &apos;s back .
why do you have bags ? why does she have bags ?
i &apos;m staying with you guys .
what ?
we &apos;re gonna be roomies !
come on .
you slept out here ?
yeah .
amy kept kicking me in her sleep , yelling , &quot; myron , get off ! &quot;
but we &apos;re getting rid of her , right ? please tell me we &apos;re getting rid of her ?
joey , i can &apos;t do that .
oh , come on .
last night i was finishing off a pizza , and she said :
&quot; a moment on the lips , forever on the hips . &quot;
i don &apos;t need that kind of talk in my house !
joey , look , i know that she &apos;s difficult ..
but i think it &apos;s really good that she &apos;s here .
because we &apos;ll appreciate it more when she &apos;s gone ?
no , it &apos;s just .. look , when i first moved to this city , i was a lot like her .
i was spoiled , self @-@ centered . and you guys really took care of me .
yeah . monica made us .
well , whatever . i really appreciate it ..
because i don &apos;t think i would be the person i am today ..
if it wasn &apos;t for you guys .
so i want to help amy the way you guys helped me .
and i know it &apos;s gonna take patience , but that &apos;s okay .
good morning .
yeah .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m wearing today . that &apos;s why i hung it on the door .
oh , sweetie , you can &apos;t pull this off .
you know what ? i was thinking that maybe now would be a good time ..
for us to sit down and , you know , talk about your future .
oh , i can &apos;t , honey . i &apos;m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped .
i am not happy .
sure you want to eat that ?
i &apos;m curvy and i like it !
hi .
hi .
i just had the worst anniversary ever .
i doubt that . tell her about us last year .
well , i bought chandler a $ 500 watch , and he wrote me a rap song .
seriously ?
word .
mine was worse than that .
well , what happened ?
we were at the game .
this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing .
that is so tacky .
well , that &apos;s what i said .
but it turns out mike was planning to propose to me that same way last night .
oh , my god . mike was gonna propose ?
that &apos;s huge .
do you want to marry him ?
yeah , i really do . yes .
but after i dumped on the way he was gonna do it ..
i don &apos;t think he &apos;ll ever ask again . i said no in barbados , and now this ?
she &apos;s right . if i were a guy and ..
did i just say , &quot; if i were a guy &quot; ?
you don &apos;t need him to propose to you . maybe you could propose to him .
oh , i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know . isn &apos;t that a little desperate ?
i proposed to chandler .
all right , moving on .
i don &apos;t think it was desperate . it was amazing .
thank you .
well , do you think i should propose ?
i think it could be kind of great .
absolutely . you &apos;ll love the feeling . there &apos;s nothing like it .
okay . okay . so how should i do it ?
how about at a game on the big screen ?
how about at a foot locker ?
what ? what , he obviously thinks that &apos;s a nice way to be proposed to .
plus , he &apos;d never suspect it .
yeah , that does make sense .
okay , now , would you two like that ?
sounds good to me .
but what would a guy think ?
nana &apos;s on the phone .
wow .
that &apos;s interesting , since she died seven years ago .
she did ?
who got her condo in boca ?
hello ?
it &apos;s our nanny .
hi .
oh , god , i hope you feel better . okay . bye .
that &apos;s molly . she &apos;s sick .
can you watch emma today ?
i can &apos;t . i have back @-@ to @-@ back classes .
did molly say what she had ? because my throat &apos;s been hurting .
menstrual cramps .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what this is .
can any of you watch emma ?
no , i &apos;m sorry , sweetie .
no , i &apos;ve got work , and then i &apos;m proposing .
great . shoot . what am i gonna do ?
well , i could do it .
well , actually ..
can i talk to you for a second ?
i do not want her babysitting our child .
why not ?
for one thing , she keeps calling her ella .
ella &apos;s a nice name .
fine , we &apos;ll call the next one ella .
the next one ?
okay .
i don &apos;t want her watching our baby .
ross , i am trying to help her become a better person .
this is a huge breakthrough for her .
she just offered to do something for another human being .
you know , i don &apos;t know .
ross , i &apos;m telling you ..
she &apos;s giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this , all right ?
do you understand how important that is in our world ?
listen , i couldn &apos;t help but overhear , because i was trying to .
listen , let me do this . i really want to help you guys out .
and plus , rachel &apos;s been so wonderful to me .
absolutely .
oh , great !
so how much does it pay ?
how &apos;s the second draft of the letter coming ?
great . i &apos;m finished . in fact , i just dropped it off at the agency .
you dropped it off ?
yeah .
can we read it ? can you print out another copy ?
no can do , amigo .
no , i didn &apos;t use the computer . it felt more personal to handwrite it .
you handwrote it ?
yeah , and don &apos;t worry .
i didn &apos;t try to sound smart at all .
see you later .
oh , my god . oh , my god . that letter is gonna go in our file .
we &apos;re never gonna get a kid .
we &apos;re gonna be one of those old couples ..
that collects orchids or has a lot of birds .
it &apos;s okay . you know what ?
i will just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter .
okay , good .
hello , this is chandler bing .
someone just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter and ..
okay .
thank you . goodbye .
we &apos;re screwed , aren &apos;t we ?
you know what ? just tell me on the way to the bird store .
they loved it .
what ?
they thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the letter .
they thought joey was a child ?
she guessed 8,9 , based on his drawings .
hi .
hey , what &apos;d you guys do today ?
ella wanted to go out , so we went shopping and got some sushi .
that sounds like fun .
yeah , not really .
babies are dull .
hey . hi , how &apos;s my girl ?
i &apos;m fine .
and i got you a present for letting me stay with you .
ready ?
yeah .
you pierced her ears ?
doesn &apos;t it make her nose look smaller ?
you pierced her ears ?
how could you do this without telling me ?
if i had told you , then it wouldn &apos;t have been a surprise , now would it ?
i think she looks cute .
but i am wrong .
oh , my god . oh , my god . here comes ross . he &apos;s gonna flip out .
why , did something happen to his falafel cart ?
hey , guys .
ross !
hi , emma . why is she wearing her hat so low ?
she can barely see .
i don &apos;t really want her to see .
why not ?
because there are so many terrible sights in this world .
like war . or that thing in joey &apos;s refrigerator . remember ?
it was in a milk carton , but it looked like meat ?
come here . come here .
there she is . hi .
what ?
nothing .
hi .
what .. ?
please tell me those are clip @-@ ons !
oh , they &apos;re real .
did she do this to her ?
i told you we shouldn &apos;t have left emma with her !
i know , i know . and you were right , ross .
okay ? you are so irresponsible ! i am never letting you babysit again !
you know what ? this kid needs me , okay ?
she needs to have a cool , fun aunt .
i &apos;m a cool , fun aunt .
okay .
hey ! monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects .
all i wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life .
this is how you repay me ?
i don &apos;t need you to help me . i already know what i &apos;m gonna do with my life .
oh , yeah ? since when ?
since today .
i am going to be a baby stylist .
what ?
that &apos;s not a thing !
well , it should be .
i &apos;m gonna help babies learn how to accessorize ..
what colors to wear , what clothes are slimming .
babies don &apos;t care if they &apos;re slim !
enter amy .
amy , i .. i just .. i just wanna ..
what ? what are you gonna do ?
no more falafel for you !
great game , huh ?
why do you keep looking at the screen ?
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m praying .
please let the knicks win .
thank you , thor .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m going to the bathroom .
well , i think you should wait .
why ?
well , if you don &apos;t hold it in , you don &apos;t get all the nutrients .
knicks fans , please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard .
someone has a special question to ask .
mike hannigan , will you marry me ?
get a load of this . she &apos;s proposing to him !
guess we know who wears the pants in that family .
well , that &apos;s not very enlightened .
boo us ? boo you !
odin will smite you !
hello ? yeah , this is joey tribbiani .
oh , hi .
well , i &apos;m glad you liked my letter .
no , my mommy and daddy aren &apos;t home right now .
okay , bye @-@ bye .
she was nice .
joey , get amy &apos;s bags . she is moving out .
you &apos;re kicking me out ?
you put holes in my baby &apos;s ears .
at least now people will know she &apos;s a girl !
i can &apos;t believe i ever even tried to help you .
you are so beyond help !
you know what ?
ever since i got here , you have been nothing but negative .
excuse me ?
you didn &apos;t want me ..
to marry the old guy with the great apartment .
then i tried to help your daughter de @-@ emphasize her flaws ..
and suddenly i &apos;m the bad guy ?
joey , where are those bags ?
she has a lot of crap !
you know ? when i moved in here , i thought , &quot; this will be so great .
just us sisters back together again like when we were kids . &quot;
except without that stupid jill .
who has gotten fat , by the way .
seriously ?
mom said she gained , like , 15 pounds .
hips or thighs ?
ass and face .
oh , my god ! i thought she was on atkins .
she was . carbs found her .
see ? this is what i wanted .
two sisters talking about real stuff .
oh , i can give you that .
you can ?
yeah .
i kept trying to make you a better person , but you &apos;re ..
you &apos;re already a pretty perfect version of what you are .
thank you .
you gotta admit , emma does look cute .
did you just say , &quot; emma &quot; ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . ella .
sis , you wanna go bring jill some pasta ?
come on , amy . now , that &apos;s just wrong .
her true weakness was garlic bread .
that woman didn &apos;t know what she was talking about , mike .
obviously , you have balls .
please , let &apos;s forget the whole thing .
i would love it .
consider it forgotten .
thank you .
but just so you know ..
however and whenever you decide to propose , i promise i &apos;ll say yes .
whether , you know , it &apos;s at a basketball game ..
or in skywriting ..
or , you know , like some lame guy in a cheesy movie ..
who hides it in the cake .
it &apos;s in the cake , isn &apos;t it ?
where else would lame mr. no balls hide it ?
what &apos;s the matter with me ? why do i keep ruining this ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
no , it &apos;s my fault .
i keep trying to propose in these stupid ways ..
and i just wanna tell you i love you , and i wanna spend my life with you ..
i &apos;m gonna do this now .
oh , my god .
phoebe , i ..
wait . oh , wait .
oh , no .
okay .
ready ? okay .
phoebe , i love you .
there &apos;s no one else in the world i would ask to marry me three times .
but i want to take care of you ..
have babies with you ..
and grow old with you .
phoebe buffay , will you marry me ?
yes .
i love you .
i love you more .
not possible .
she &apos;s gonna be mrs. no balls !
so how &apos;s the baby @-@ styling business going ?
not that great .
it &apos;s almost as if people don &apos;t want to hear that their babies are ugly .
that &apos;s shocking .
there &apos;s ross . hey , ross .
hello , ross ?
