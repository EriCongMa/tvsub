if mickey mantle had this much water pressure ,
he &apos;d have hit 60 before maris .
after that , all you can talk about is baseball and plumbing ?
oh , this game &apos;s going extra innings .
you think you can knock it out of the park ?
oh , i know i can .
oh , yeah ?
oh , yeah .
you okay ?
yeah , that was weird . i just got a chill .
did you get your flu shot ? there &apos;s a bug going around .
i haven &apos;t been sick since 1996 .
now , come on , i &apos;m up to bat ,
and you--
you feel hot .
you look hot .
well , this game &apos;s rained out .
i &apos;m taking your temperature .
oh , honey .
no , please , come on . we can play through this .
all right ? come on , batter up .
open up .
colony collapse , neal .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re dealing with here .
apis mellifera are dying off in terrifying proportions .
timmy nolan park .
people for the awareness of near earth objects ,
and now the plight of the honeybees .
our nation &apos;s agriculture depends on these drones .
without pollination , there &apos;s no strawberries ,
no almonds--
no grapes ?
is this about wine ?
maybe . you have room for three hives .
that &apos;s three more beehives than i want on my terrace .
i mean , is beekeeping even legal in new york ?
across all five boroughs .
i mean , where &apos;s the danger ?
swarms spring to mind .
although a hive would be a decent hiding spot for contraband .
and an excellent business opportunity .
pollen , propolis , and honey
have been known for their healing properties
since ancient greece .
and cleopatra bathed
in milk and honey , and , take it from me ,
what it did for my undercarriage--
okay . start with one hive .
see you later .
probably just allergies .
all those trees dropping pollen everywhere .
i do love how leafy this neighborhood is .
what is neal doing here ?
does he have a tracker on you ?
told him i was walking you to work .
morning , peter .
morning .
elizabeth .
morning .
want me to carry that for you ?
you &apos;re casing her art .
what ?
you &apos;re casing my art ?
please . you guys qualify
for the friends and family plan .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
speaking of families ...
oh , yeah , that &apos;s unbelievable .
figure your kid &apos;s dead ...
then after 15 years , patrick shows up at the front door .
how does a 14 @-@ year @-@ old evade an international manhunt ?
when was the last time you saw him ?
the summer before my junior year .
oh , i fell in love with europe .
we were going to museums in every city ,
and it was one of the best tutoring jobs i ever had .
沃尔科特继承人回到镀金笼
but then he ran away from boarding school in switzerland ,
and i never heard from him again .
must be nice to have a father
who welcomes you home with old masters .
he wanted a lot of new pieces before the homecoming party .
oh , well , it will be nice to see him
and william , and , wow , bea was just a baby .
and of course stanton .
who &apos;s stanton ?
the butler . he was kind of the glue
that kept the family together .
just one butler ?
very frugal for gazillionaires .
okay , i &apos;m leaving .
hey , by the way , i &apos;m gonna be putting alarms on the art .
no .
just one .
what &apos;s going on ?
you sick ?
come on .
the mortensen real estate scandal &apos;s
not gonna solve itself .
i wish it would .
mrs. burke . do come in .
stanton , you still can call me elizabeth .
unfortunately , i cannot .
good day .
dad , you can &apos;t fire him .
i &apos;m telling you it &apos;s a violation of labor rights .
bea , when you have graduated from harvard law ,
we &apos;ll continue this conversation .
but stanton didn &apos;t do it .
elizabeth .
william .
is this a good time ?
of course .
this is my daughter bea .
i met you when you were a baby .
mm , i &apos;ve heard the stories .
and i &apos;m not going to law school .
elizabeth , my apologies .
bea spends so much time with her head stuck in novels
that the realities of life are all the harsher .
is it true about stanton ?
what happened ?
he leaked the truth
about my health to the press .
it was damaging to my business and a personal betrayal .
i &apos;m really sorry to hear that .
how are you ?
well , blood sugar spikes like the market ,
ticker &apos;s on mile 24 , but screw the doctors .
now that patrick &apos;s home , i feel like i &apos;m 40 again .
and ? how is he ?
well , he &apos;s patrick .
as you know , art was the only thing we had in common ,
and i &apos;m still hoping that &apos;s a way we can connect .
liz mitchell . i &apos;m coming in .
patrick ? wow .
you &apos;re taller .
and lost the blue hair .
i like this better .
you are as beautiful as ever .
yeah , that got us kicked out of the accademia in florence .
wow , you still have your scar too .
what was that name of the horse again ?
cheval chase .
yes .
threw me clear over the fence at stony hill .
mm , and that was the first time i thought i &apos;d lost you .
i &apos;m gonna go check on bea .
all right , kid ,
i &apos;ve got a lot of questions .
after mom died , i begged dad to let me stay in the city
with him and bea .
i was so sad about your mom .
dad wanted me to go to le rosey .
but i wasn &apos;t ready .
is that why you ran ?
i was tired of living on his terms .
you were just a kid .
how did you do it ?
saved my allowance .
on a ski day , i snowboarded from zermatt to cervinia ,
sold my gear , hopped on a train ,
and never looked back .
you put your family through hell .
what made you come back ?
dad .
rumors that he was sick were all over the papers .
i came back for him , not for this life .
he &apos;s trying .
by buying me art ?
it &apos;s his way of bonding .
let him .
okay .
well , i remember your tastes .
dutch masters , baroque ,
abstract expressionists .
that one .
the picasso .
the homme au cornet ?
i put this in as a joke .
do you remember the reina sofia ?
you called guernica a bastard child
of cubist @-@ surrealist movement
and accused picasso of crimes against beauty .
i was a kid .
tastes change .
you sure ?
yeah . i love it .
well , i &apos;ll have the gallery send it over .
elizabeth . how &apos;s downton abbey ?
i know this is gonna sound weird ,
but i don &apos;t think patrick wolcott is patrick wolcott .
it &apos;s his eyes . they &apos;re the right color ,
but it doesn &apos;t feel like him .
you think he &apos;s an imposter ?
so it &apos;s possible .
yeah , missing rich kids are a subset .
you got your patty hearsts ,
your john paul gettys ,
talented mr. ripleys .
william wolcott is a perfect mark .
a very sick , emotionally fragile mark .
will you look into it ?
yeah . i have to run it by peter , but ...
how he &apos;s holding up ?
i will find out .
how are you feeling ?
tip @-@ top . million bucks .
even if he is a ringer , you &apos;re telling me
william wolcott wouldn &apos;t know his own son ?
emotion is a con man &apos;s sweet spot .
and i have good reason to believe
that that is not the real patrick .
better be good .
it is .
better be damn good .
it is .
does your wife &apos;s intuition count ?
el called you ?
i did say you guys were
on the friends and family plan .
is this some elaborate ruse to avoid the mortensen case ?
okay , that hurts my feelings , because we &apos;re looking
at potential identity theft , fraud .
a family &apos;s fortune is at stake ,
not to mention the charitable foundation .
based on what ?
pablo picasso .
kid hated his work ,
and now he &apos;s pushing elizabeth to buy one .
you want me to launch into an investigation
based on a picasso snafu ?
peter , this is like you suddenly becoming a red sox fan .
i &apos;d have to be--
i &apos;m--you &apos;d have to what ?
i &apos;d have to be a different person .
thank you .
it &apos;s hot in here .
yeah , you really don &apos;t look good .
you should go home .
i &apos;m not going home .
i &apos;m not sick . i &apos;ve never gone home sick .
you &apos;re gonna have to give me more than picasso .
also suspicious-- mr. wolcott fired his butler
of over 30 years .
good help is hard to find .
or he was set up .
the smart move is to jettison
anyone who intimately knew the real patrick .
we &apos;d need a dna test .
his father hasn &apos;t ordered one .
but elizabeth could grab a hair when she &apos;s over there .
okay , i &apos;m not sending my wife in as a secret agent .
so send me in .
how ?
the wolcotts need a new butler .
i can buttle .
buttle ?
yeah , it &apos;s a verb .
neal caffrey at your service .
i don &apos;t air dirty laundry .
i see that it &apos;s cleaned .
i did not speak with the press .
ah . oh , thank you .
yes . would you like one ?
ex ... excuse me .
one pours from the right .
always from the right . may i ?
are you feeling warm , sir ?
i am .
but i &apos;ve got my own , thanks .
stanton , you &apos;re not under investigation ,
but we do have questions about patrick .
do you have any reason to believe this isn &apos;t him ?
he &apos;s grown , of course .
but the mannerisms ...
if it isn &apos;t , he &apos;s a brilliant study .
if he is a fraud , you could have exposed him .
he might have sabotaged you .
we need physical evidence .
a dna mismatch would prove
he isn &apos;t a wolcott .
thanks to elizabeth &apos;s recommendation ,
william hired me as your replacement .
excuse me . you ?
rhett carlyle , domestic artist .
he buttled in a castle in hampshire .
it &apos;s a verb .
i am aware .
how long did you work in hampshire ?
till he was caught with a princess .
suspected . never caught .
but the evidence was overwhelming .
i didn &apos;t steal the silverware .
there is more to private service
than consorting with the landed gentry .
in addition to scheduling valet and chauffeur duties ,
one needs to develop an acute sense of observation .
you wear your oxfords with a luster , not a shine ,
lattice @-@ laced .
carpal tunnel in your wrist ,
probably from years of pouring from the right .
and , peter--peter .
yes .
muscle fatigue , dry lips ,
watery eyes , nausea--
i am a brilliant study , and this man has the flu ,
so you might want to keep your distance .
my life &apos;s work has been protecting that family .
i want that to matter .
then tell me everything i need to know
about taking care of the wolcotts .
carlyle .
chauncey &apos;s ready for his walk .
thank you , miss bea .
there &apos;s a reading of franny and zooey at the 92nd street y.
i managed to secure you two tickets .
mid @-@ century american fiction .
my weakness .
come on , chauncey .
hey , bea .
hey , patrick .
say hi , chaunce .
how was your ride ?
every morning there &apos;s something else i remember about this city .
may i take your helmet , sir ?
no , i am gonna fix the strap .
may i take your jacket ?
no , i got it .
you must be thirsty .
my father thinks people need servants .
i don &apos;t . i can take care of myself .
of course .
mr. wolcott , the times , herald , and guardian
all open to the financial section ,
and your amaranth toast
with almond butter &apos;s in the dining room .
my blood sugar and i thank you , carlyle .
elizabeth , good morning .
good morning , william .
carlyle .
good morning , mrs. burke .
carlyle is wonderful .
where did you get him ?
oh , he actually worked
for a family that i &apos;m very close to .
the picasso &apos;s coming this morning ,
and i have a de la tour to show you .
let &apos;s have a look .
nice uniform , slick .
the family hired a team of private investigators ...
worked with interpol--
hey , peter , you try acetaminophen ?
ibuprofen ?
the daytime stuff , the nighttime stuff ?
what about the pink stuff ?
okay .
peter burke .
yeah , stay in there .
you &apos;re kicking me out ?
no , no , no , just--just taking
the appropriate medical precautions .
okay .
you can see the map , right ?
everything &apos;s good ?
patrick got out of germany on a barge .
the family paid a ton in tips .
most of them happened right after he ran from school .
he was first spotted at the train station in--
dusseldorf .
peter , go home .
we got this . okay ?
caffrey is doing his thing .
go home .
oh , i got my tie .
nothing .
neal , hey .
you sound terrible .
where are you ?
i &apos;m working from home .
mr. &quot; no sick days &quot; went home .
did you get the evidence ?
it &apos;s gonna be harder than we thought .
i dusted patrick &apos;s glass .
he wiped it .
you sure about that ?
yeah .
hairbrush is clean . toothbrush ...
and razor are sanitized .
the surfaces are spotless .
either this guy &apos;s a total neat freak ...
or he has a reason to be living
without leaving a ... trace .
is he this careful all over the house ?
yeah , he wouldn &apos;t even hand me his bike helmet .
he &apos;s careful .
i think elizabeth &apos;s right .
yeah . she usually is .
i gotta go .
he onto you ?
it looks great , you guys .
thank you so much .
sorry , liz .
didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
it &apos;s okay . i was just admiring the picasso .
remember those guards who threatened to call the policia
when my manifesto against cubism got too loud ?
and i used every spanish word i knew just to charm them .
you promised that we would go to a bullfight
if i kept my mouth shut , which was a lie .
but we did go to tapas at casa del abuelo ,
and you let me have a caña , which was sent over
by that matador who took a shine to you .
antonio .
paco .
it all came back to me .
eventually .
sir ?
miss bea ?
would you mind
keeping it down a little bit ?
i &apos;m working on a genealogy project .
apologies .
i mistook it for snooping .
seems we have a pot @-@ kettle situation .
no comment .
find anything interesting ?
um , travel journal .
fairly informative .
you know , i grew up hearing
all about my brother , and now that he &apos;s actually here ,
he &apos;s only told me things i already know .
maybe you could ask about his travels .
it doesn &apos;t seem like he really wants to talk to me .
i &apos;m sorry , miss bea .
and now stanton &apos;s fired ,
and dad &apos;s really sick .
soon he &apos;ll be gone too .
and then it &apos;ll just be me and patrick .
and you don &apos;t want to be left with someone you don &apos;t know .
why are you in here ?
i thought you could wear this to dinner tonight , sir .
tell my father no matter how many designer coats
he crams in my closet ,
i &apos;m not wearing one .
may i ask ,
how does a teenager evade an international search ?
doctored my dorm mates &apos; passports ,
used &apos; em to cross borders , and then traded &apos; em
when i needed supplies .
bartered to conserve cash . clever .
colored contacts , a baseball cap .
switched up your accents and avoided portofino in july ?
santorini was more my style .
is that your journal ?
tales of my travels .
looks like it got wet .
dropped it in the aegean .
you &apos;re lucky , sir .
why &apos;s that ?
after all this ,
your father will take you back .
why not put on a jacket ,
make the old man happy ?
carlyle , you are something else .
enjoy your dinner .
&apos;cause i got your print .
honey , herbal tea .
okay .
and i got ginger .
and oscillococcinum .
i don &apos;t eat things that i can &apos;t say .
at least tell us how you lifted the cuff link
while i eat things i can &apos;t say .
pda .
public display of affection ?
elizabeth , can i use your jacket ?
sure .
i &apos;m not sure i like this .
clip this to your left sleeve .
this is not going to work .
oh , it &apos;s gonna work .
i &apos;m gonna steal something right off your wrist .
watch .
oh , i &apos;m watching .
proximity manipulation .
diversion technique .
attention control .
proximity , diversion , attention .
pda .
it &apos;s still there .
from your other wrist .
i even told you what i was gonna steal .
wristwatch .
you have a gentle touch .
oh , oh , that &apos;s enough .
hey , jones .
oh , better .
got it . thanks .
well , do you have a magic trick that can turn bad news
into good news ?
why , what &apos;s up ?
the prints on the cuff link were perfect ,
except they belong to a person
who &apos;s never committed a crime .
and it wasn &apos;t common to fingerprint kids
when patrick was younger , so he &apos;s not in the database .
i could send it to quantico
for a mitochondrial dna test .
that takes too long . i can get some actual dna ,
and we can run the test here .
return the cuff link and try my technique .
g.a.f.
g.a.f.
grab a fork .
grab-- literally steal the silverware .
you &apos;re a cliche .
get over it .
he &apos;s grumpy when he &apos;s sick .
lean back .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
how &apos;s life on golden pond ?
and i see you opened the brunello .
oh , yeah , i saved you--
enjoy .
thanks .
moz .
oh , for once i &apos;m not the only one in the room with a buzz .
it &apos;s loud for one hive .
i may have acquired three .
skinny gianetta got nabbed , so his wife put out feelers .
so in addition to me being undercover as a butler
and taking care of peter ,
i &apos;m now the guardian of orphan bees .
what ails the suit ?
it &apos;s that flu that &apos;s going around .
that &apos;s perfect .
it seems fitting that a man of his persuasion
should be my guinea pig .
18 amino acids packed into an antimicrobial ,
flavonoid @-@ filled , honey @-@ based tonic
that will rid you of your symptoms
and also cure warts , elevate your mood ,
and enhance performance .
thank me later .
or don &apos;t .
don &apos;t .
i &apos;m supposed to drink this ?
one now , the second in two hours ,
and the third within four hours of the first .
oh , i must be crazy to even consider this .
could you feel any worse ?
probably not .
i got to get to the wolcotts .
feel better , peter .
i &apos;ll stay here and observe .
observe what ? what &apos;s gonna happen ?
well , the first 15 minutes-- well , let &apos;s see .
well , it &apos;s going to happen .
dad , it &apos;s not what i want .
it &apos;s what i want . consider that .
my attorney is sending it over .
may i take your cup ?
no .
no .
so this conversation &apos;s over .
in my mind it is .
let &apos;s talk about something else .
did you know that picasso used to burn his own work for warmth ?
that &apos;s right . he did .
sir .
资产分配计划
oh , this was a mistake .
it was supposed to go to the business manager .
here you go .
thank you .
good afternoon .
time for vial number two .
where &apos;d mozzie go ?
he needed to check on his queen .
assuming he meant bee ,
but with him ...
you never know .
this came for you .
i can &apos;t open it . it &apos;s for william wolcott .
but it &apos;s addressed to peter burke .
you know , i think your wife
had to open it for you because you &apos;re extremely sick .
besides , no one will ever know .
we can just reseal it .
neal &apos;s a very bad influence on you .
oh , yes .
wow . that was perfect .
neal found out what patrick &apos;s after-- a trust fund .
he was supposed to inherit it when he was 21 .
they &apos;re redoing the paperwork today .
$ 40 million .
yeah .
honey , if he gets that , he &apos;s gonna disappear .
william &apos;s heart can &apos;t take that .
i got to let him know what &apos;s going on .
no . bring william to the f.b.i.
i want to talk to him .
i &apos;m not sure what this patrick is capable of .
he could be dangerous .
babe , look , this is a hard conversation to have with a father ,
and it needs to come from a friend .
besides , you need to take it easy .
no , i don &apos;t want to take it easy .
i feel better .
well , that &apos;s great .
i &apos;ll let you know how it goes at the wolcotts &apos; , okay ?
besides , i want you to lay down .
william , i &apos;m not trying to upset you .
being married to an f.b.i. agent
has made you cynical .
it &apos;s time for your insulin , sir .
this has nothing to do with peter , okay ?
i was fooled too .
i &apos;m offended , elizabeth !
the whole house can hear you .
this is ridiculous .
patrick should have no problem consenting to a blood test .
you don &apos;t believe me ?
fine . draw the blood right now .
i don &apos;t need this , patrick .
she does .
how many others think you &apos;re a fool ?
i won &apos;t stick a needle into my own son .
okay .
i &apos;ll do it .
there .
test it .
the house is equidistant from the avenues ,
but we don &apos;t want him to get that far .
entry and exit points of the wolcott residence , upper windows too .
we &apos;re gonna have three agents by the utility van ,
two more undercover--
three more .
look , peter , you &apos;re a biohazard .
i &apos;m on the mend .
i swear .
and after this--
what is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
mozzie gave it to me .
oh , god .
it works .
i &apos;m in on this bust . my wife is in there .
when it all goes down , we &apos;ll move in for the arrest .
good boy . come on , chauncey .
it looks like mozzie &apos;s tincture &apos;s working .
i &apos;m coming off the dl .
baseball . disabled list .
did you check out the lab they used to test the blood ?
it &apos;s reputable .
i put an agent there in case patrick tried anything .
william had the sample picked up from the house .
i sealed it and handed it to the technician myself .
so patrick didn &apos;t tamper with it .
no , but i &apos;m sure he has something planned
when the dna comes back a mismatch .
i want to know what it is . audio .
check one , two .
check one , two .
i &apos;ll keep an eye on elizabeth .
come on , chaunce . come on .
that &apos;s a good boy .
everything all right , miss bea ?
the blood tests are back .
what we have here , carlyle , is a real moment of truth .
everyone , i have news ,
and you need to hear it .
you &apos;ve all been working very hard
to prepare for the party on sunday ,
but there &apos;s been a change of plans .
the celebration will now take place tomorrow .
i don &apos;t want to wait any longer to welcome home
my son .
i &apos;m so glad to be back .
i shouldn &apos;t have put you through this .
the dna was a match .
also i want to thank elizabeth for all that she &apos;s done .
today is her last day .
william , i &apos;m sorry .
you know i was just thinking of you and bea .
the days i have left with my son are numbered .
forcing him to do this ,
he could have walked out the door ,
and it would have been your fault .
i &apos;ll send your check .
what did i do ?
well , i &apos;m fired ,
and you don &apos;t have to be a butler anymore .
i can &apos;t just leave .
maybe i &apos;ll see how french that maid really is .
liz . i tried to talk to my father ,
but you know how stubborn he is .
well , he &apos;s upset with me ,
and i can understand that .
i already took chauncey on his walk .
oh . well , i heard him coughing .
i &apos;m gonna take him to the vet .
well , if he &apos;s not feeling well , he shouldn &apos;t walk .
it &apos;s not far .
it is if he can &apos;t breathe .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll drive them .
i &apos;ll get the car .
good day , mrs. burke .
take care , patrick .
you too , liz .
wait here , and don &apos;t move the car .
yes , sir .
hey , peter . patrick hates the dog .
now he &apos;s bringing it to the vet .
i heard . you &apos;re wired .
you &apos;ve gone from my man godfrey
to ace ventura .
i &apos;m telling you , he &apos;s got another move .
neal , recon only .
you find anything , you pull me in .
you got it .
i feel good . really good .
great . you and the wolcotts &apos; dog .
patrick went to the vet for himself .
i watched the tech remove something from his arm right here .
plastic ?
yeah .
look like a vein ?
i don &apos;t know . it was about 2 / 3 this size .
that &apos;s a penrose drain .
there was a case in florida--
a guy implanted one to fool a dna test .
filled with someone else &apos;s blood ?
yeah .
that &apos;s why patrick drew his own .
this blood was fresh .
which means 48 hours ago
the real patrick wolcott was alive .
and in new york .
you know , we &apos;re kind of good at this .
what ?
william &apos;s signing over the trust fund tomorrow .
and once fake patrick gets what he wants ...
he won &apos;t have any reason to keep the real patrick around .
no .
we pulled in the vet tech .
of course he denies implanting a penrose drain .
we searched the property . no signs of the tubing .
we &apos;re holding him on suspicion
so he can &apos;t tip patrick off ?
you better believe it .
well , we won &apos;t get a warrant for another dna testing
without permission from the family .
why don &apos;t we just grab the bastard
and tell him we know about the drain ?
tempting , but we have no leverage .
so let &apos;s get some leverage .
how do we do that ?
picasso .
yeah , yeah , picasso .
all right , our imposter
learned everything he could about patrick &apos;s life .
but he didn &apos;t know elizabets picasso story ,
which proves he doesn &apos;t know everything .
yeah , and he doesn &apos;t know
what he doesn &apos;t know .
we need to ask him
something that he thinks only the real patrick knows the answer to .
and give him a reason to get that answer .
elizabeth asks him about picasso
the next morning he knows everything .
the bike rides .
he goes on one every morning . it &apos;s always for an hour .
that &apos;s got to be how he &apos;s keeping patrick alive .
and how he got the picasso story ?
and the blood .
jones , get a radius set up in op --
car , bike , foot , whatever .
make sure we stay on him wherever he goes .
gotcha .
patrick was gone for 15 years .
he probably didn &apos;t meet the imposter right away .
the first time he was spotted after he ran away
from boarding school was at dusseldorf .
and that &apos;s where leo kovak comes in .
who is leo kovak ?
he &apos;s the reason fake patrick has to get the answer .
who is leo kovak ?
i &apos;m leo kovak ?
you are a very angry croatian .
you work for the von kesslers ,
and you want to know what the hell happened in dusseldorf .
what happened in dusseldorf ?
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s got to be more convincing .
what happened in dusseldorf ?
