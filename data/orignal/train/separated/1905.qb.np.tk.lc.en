that our inpatients are taken care of and discharge who we can .
like me .

and &quot; bailey &quot; is a good name .
but two baileys ? you don &apos;t think it &apos;s gonna be confusing ?
no , because ... if i say , &quot; bailey peed on me , &quot;
i think it &apos;s safe to assume that i &apos;m talking about my son .
very good . seriously , wake me in 20 ?
okay .
thank you .
i feel like i &apos;m gonna die .
shepherd ?
yeah , lydia ashford . injuries to the upper extremities .

uh , karev , kepner &apos;s in trauma one .
get her to tell her patient 5818 shore drive made it .
kepner !
tell your guy 5818 is out .
i could &apos;ve done that .
i &apos;m sorry , but i need a neuro consult in bay 7 .
the guy &apos;s unconscious , but he &apos;s stable .
look what i found in outpatient surgery .
ross , stay here . i paged brooks .
have her get mrs. ashford a pan scan
of the head , neck , chest , and abdomen .
well , i can take her .
no , have brooks do it .
uh , the mayor &apos;s on the phone ,
wants to know about casualties from the mudslide .
i told him it was soon to tell ,
but he wants to hear it from you .
hey , um , go find dr. webber .
i &apos;m supposed to give dr. brooks a message from dr. shepherd .
uh , is that life @-@ threatening ?
because not having enough general surgeons
in here right now is life @-@ threatening .
go find webber .
have you seen dr. webber ?
uh , last time i saw him was after surgery .
he went to go check on the generator .
where &apos;s that ?
how the hell should i know ?
lidocaine and a bunch of 4x4s .
can you take that to hunt ? i got paged by shepherd .
uh ... he wants you to go find webber .
are you sure ? he just paged me 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 2 .
that &apos;s our special little code .
it means more emergent than 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 . get it ?
all i know is they need webber here ,
and shepherd wants you to get him .
apparently , he went to deal with the generator .
and i &apos;m walking toward the car ,
and suddenly the hillside just goes ...
and i &apos;m falling .
i see my squad car coming down on top of me ,
so i managed to roll out of the way ,
but my ... my leg was caught under it .
can you salvage it ?
i think so . we &apos;ll get ortho down here .
i &apos;m gonna take a look
at that nasty laceration on your neck , though .
it &apos;s a lot of embedded debris .
hey , tilden ? everyone make it out of the mud ?
everyone &apos;s accounted for except lauenstein ,
phil g , and brian .
brian &apos;s my fiance ?
don &apos;t worry . you know him . he &apos;s gonna be fine .
look , he &apos;s probably giving himself a mud facial .
you know , look good for the wedding .
yeah , well , if he had cold feet ,
he shoulda just said so .
dr. webber ?
dr. webber !
oh , crap . dr. webber !
第十季 第一 &amp; 二集

we &apos;re gonna do a head c.t.
i &apos;m more concerned about infection .
that is a nasty cut on his leg .
well , dr. wilson &apos;s irrigating it with saline .
but we couldn &apos;t find any bacitracin ,
we &apos;re gonna hang some ampicillin .
no ampicillin ! he &apos;s allergic to penicillin .
how do you know ?
what the hell ?
military trick .
someone triaged him at the scene--
probably whoever dug him out .
substitute cefazolin and keep a close eye for allergic reaction .
all right . get some cefazolin .
we don &apos;t have it .
well , find it .
someone at the scene knew what they were doing .
might &apos;ve just saved this guy &apos;s life .
oh . sharpie here , too .
and it indicates he &apos;s getting worse fast .
his b.p. was better in the field . crap .
okay , we need to stabilize his pelvis .
okay , you &apos;re gonna need to pull harder .
talk to me , murphy .
c.t. showed an open book pelvic fracture
on a liver lac with hemorrhage .
harder , murphy .
i &apos;m afraid if i pull too hard , i &apos;m gonna make it worse .
you can &apos;t--move . can &apos;t make it worse .
it &apos;s already as bad as it can be .
all right , i need to get this guy upstairs
and put on an ex fix immediately .
murphy , book an o.r.
and ask bailey to scrub in .

all right , uh , charge again to 200 .
clear .
karev ? what &apos;s going on with richard ?
uh , echo shows very little heart activity ,
and c.v.p. &apos; s elevated .
yang &apos;s about to set up for a balloon pump .
all right , well , if we &apos;re sending him up to surgery ,
let &apos;s make sure we have an adequate blood supply for transfusion .
on it .
if--if you need to go deal with more dire patients ,
i get it . go . i &apos;m fine .
actually , you &apos;re not , sasha . it &apos;s important that
we go ahead and debde and clean out this wound
as soon as possible to prevent infection .
sasha ... are you supposed to be walking around in that thing ?
i can &apos;t sit still .
i &apos;m waiting on plastic surgery to sew me up .
that &apos;s this guy .
you mind if i , uh , if i sit here ?
that kinda looks like brian &apos;s handwriting .
yeah , i know . my glasses got knocked off in the slide .
i could barely see a thing , but it could &apos;ve been .
but was it his voice ?
i can &apos;t remember . i &apos;m sorry , sash .
i was kinda out of it , you know ?
i &apos;m sorry .
just a little discoloration in the tissue .
i &apos;d like to run a few tests

webber and brooks are down . they were electrocuted .
it &apos;s bad , but we &apos;re--we &apos;re-- we &apos;re--we &apos;re dealing with it .
i just need you to get on the phone
and help us get those supplies , okay ?
okay . okay .
here .
your turn not to freak out .
okay , forceps .
metz .
i have a status update on dr. webber .
okay .
dr. yang is attempting to place a balloon pump ,
but he keeps coding .
she &apos;s placing one bedside without fluoro ?
she could rupture his aorta .
do you want me to get dr. yang on the phone ?
you just said she &apos;s threading a balloon pump .
she is , but ...
then how is she gonna talk on the phone ?
i didn &apos;t ... mean ...
retract her .
oh , no .
no , no , no .
okay , let &apos;s run the bowel .
the abdomen &apos;s fully contaminated .
just run the bowel .
we &apos;re gonna resect this and get out of here .
let &apos;s get ready to pack him .
come on , lenny .
it &apos;s too quiet .
talk .
y @-@ you &apos;re doing good .
you ... are not going to rupture the aorta
because you ... are cristina yang .
attach this to the console .
you are the star of your class .
i always knew it . i said it to anyone who &apos;d ask--
&quot; look out for cristina yang . &quot; i @-@ i said it to webber .
&quot; cristina yang is good . &quot;
&quot; cristina yang would not rupture an aorta . &quot;
&quot; cristina ya-- &quot;
oh , god , you did it .
oh , dear lord . he has a steady heartbeat .
oh , praise jesus . you didn &apos;t rupture his aorta .
secure this device and get him up to the i.c.u.
we just bought him some time .
hug me back , cristina yang .
i know you are not a hugger ,
but right now i need you to hug me back .
hey , mrs. ashford .
did you find out ?
press against my hands with the bottoms of your feet .
find out what ?
about my house .
it has the most beautiful crown moldings .
now with your hands .
i &apos;m sorry . i haven &apos;t had time to ask about your house .
how &apos;s your vision ?
any blurriness ?
my vision ?
i don &apos;t care about my--
s @-@ stop .
stop this nonsense .
just call somebody , please . find out about my house .
ma &apos;am , this isn &apos;t nonsense .
i &apos;m trying to help you , and i have about 20 other patients ,
so checking on your house is the last thing
on my mind right now .
people got injured badly ,
so you need to stop worrying about your house ,
and you need to tell me if you are experiencing
any blurriness of vision .
his lactate is 6 .
6 ?
uh , he has an acute abdomen . get me an o.r. and a good staff .
i &apos;ll take , uh , linda , if she &apos;s available . norman .
are you out of your mind ?
norman &apos;s m.i.a.
okay , anna , then .
i &apos;ll make some phone calls .
you &apos;re not opening him up .
the electrical injury
may have caused intra @-@ abdominal tissue damage
and likely progressing because of his heart failing .
he barely tolerated the balloon pump .
i need to get in there and debride the dead tissue .
there &apos;s no way his heart can handle the anesthesia .
his lactate is 6 .
he needs sustained cardiac i.c.u.
he &apos;s gonna die if we don &apos;t do anything .
we &apos;re not doing nothing .
we &apos;re gonna let the balloon pump work ..
i am the attending ...
and keep his fluids tight .
you are a fellow . i make the decisions here .
well , i own this hospital . you work for me .
he &apos;s bleeding through the packing ,
and there &apos;s still stool coming out .
damn it . we need to take it out and resect more intestines .
how &apos;s his i.n.r. ?
the last one was 6 .
okay , give him factor vii , f.f.p.s and platelets .
faster , kepner .
he &apos;s having arrhythmias .
talk to me .
uh ... i can &apos;t get a pulse .
i think he &apos;s in p.e.a.
starting compressions .
i know this is difficult ,
but brooks is our patient .
i &apos;m telling you this to remind you to be her doctor ,
not her friend right now .
there are decisions to be made in there
that will affect not only her ability to be a surgeon ...
her speech , her ability to function , her life .
but those decisions are ultimately mine .
i will not make them lightly .
but i will make them quickly ,
and you need to do exactly as i say . no questions .
can you do that ?
i think so .
that &apos;s not good enough .
yes , sir . i @-@ i can do it , sir .
i &apos;ll take this to the labs ,
and dr. avery will let you know the results .
thank you .
hey . heard you were looking for this guy .
brian !
i was so worried . get over here and give me a kiss , you jerk .
baby , i &apos;m all muddy .
i don &apos;t care .
are you okay ?
mmm . i knew that was your handwriting .
what are you talking about ?
on oscar .
didn &apos;t you pull him out ?
no .
someone triaged a bunch of guys at the scene
and wrote vitals down with a sharpie .
yeah , i wish that was me .
i was just sitting in an air pocket ,
twiddling my thumbs .
uh , i actually think i &apos;m having some trouble moving .
i think i broke some ribs .
let &apos;s get those checked out .
yeah .
um , i heard lenny was in surgery . how &apos;s he doing ?
i don &apos;t know .
p.h. is down to 7.12 .
come on , lenny .
he &apos;s been down 20 minutes .
did you say &quot; yes &quot; ?
sir ?
to matthew .
i helped with his proposal .
oh , uh , yeah . yes . i said &quot; yes . &quot;
good .
i like him . he &apos;s a good guy .
i mean , these guys--
these first responders-- they &apos;re all good guys .
hate to give up .
damn it , lenny .
time of death--1556 .
it &apos;s dr. karev . the firefighters are asking for an update .
chaplain &apos;s on his way to tell marla and the girls .
she &apos;s gonna wanna come in
and see him .
absolutely .
let &apos;s bring her in . full lights and sirens .
on it .
lauenstein &apos;s still missing .
we gotta bring him back . we gotta do that for lenny .
if i could walk , i &apos;d be out on that pile .
excuse me .
kelly clamp .
suction .
guys , he &apos;s almost lost his entire blood volume .
if you don &apos;t get control up there--
it &apos;s already done .
i controlled the bleeding using a pringle maneuver .
wow . cool .
don &apos;t be so impressed . it &apos;s fairly standard .
yeah , i know , but you did it so well .
i was wrong before , murphy ,
when i implied that dr. robbins wasn &apos;t a real general surgeon .
she is . she &apos;s an excellent general surgeon .
it &apos;s okay . we &apos;ve all said things that we shouldn &apos;t have .
oh , owen .
owen , no . you &apos;re not gonna &quot; owen &quot; this .
no personal relationships . this is professional .
this is dr. hunt .
what is going on ?
dr. webber has an acute abdomen .
he needs surgery .
he barely survived the balloon pump .
his lactate is 6 ...
and holding .
so what if it &apos;s holding ? something is dead inside of him .
it &apos;s not gonna get undead .
it is way too risky , and you know it .
i would rather take the risk
than just wait for what we know is gonna kill him .
stop , stop . what does his healthcare directive say
about extraordinary measures ?
whoa . i smell dead people .
oh , and spiders . dead people killed by spiders .
okay , let &apos;s find his personnel file .
oh ! okay , i , uh , got it .
&quot; webber . &quot;
oh , no .
what , he doesn &apos;t have a healthcare directive ?
no . he has one .
i don &apos;t understand .
richard designated you as his medical power of attorney .
but he can &apos;t make me next of kin
without talking to me first .
he did .
after adele died , he revised his directive .
but--
meredith , i know this is a shock ,
but we don &apos;t have much time .
right now you need to make a decision .
his heart is too weak , meredith .
his heart can take it .
you trust me , right ? you named your baby after me .
hey , hey !
no personal relationships .
the amount of electricity he had in his body
should have killed him instantly ,
but it didn &apos;t , which tells me that the heart damage
isn &apos;t as bad as you think .
he coded four times .
and we got him back !
oh , and now you just sound idiotic .
ah @-@ ah ! dr. yang !
no , seriously . you sound like a family member
who googled &quot; electrocution &quot;
and is trying to remain optimistic .
well , i am optimistic .
well , richard should have made bailey his family member ,
because that is how she &apos;s acting right now .
i wish he would &apos;ve .
well , he didn &apos;t . he put meredith down .
why would he do that ?
and she knows as well as i do that electric shock
can cause death of tissues which could start a whole
inflammatory cascade unless i debride what &apos;s been damaged .
well , he &apos;ll have to handle it for a day to let his heart rest .
and then ...
he can &apos;t handle it ?
okay , now you sound like an idiot .
letting that tissue die is like taking a gun
and killing him .
why wouldn &apos;t he tell me ?
i don &apos;t know , but he didn &apos;t .
and it &apos;s on you , so you have to decide , mer .
yes . meredith , please .
damn it .
just damn it .
it &apos;s massive . but ...
we can just evacuate it , right ?
it doesn &apos;t change our plan .
do what we can and hope for the best .
can you see her vital signs ?
yeah . bad .
at least shane &apos;s happy .
heather &apos;s out of the competition .
that was mean ... even for you .
it was a joke . i &apos;m trying to lighten the mood .
our friend is dying .
you don &apos;t even like her .
oh , my god .
just ignore her , steph .
well , she usually does .
we should get back .
i like heather .
i know .
you know what i was thinking before you guys came in here ?
i was thinking i wish my mother were here
to see my kids .
i was wondering if she &apos;d make a good grandmother .
but you know what that is ?
that &apos;s delusional thinking .
because my mother would make a horrible grandmother ,
because she was a horrible mother .
so ... i &apos;m delusional and hormonal .
and i can &apos;t trust my delusional thoughts .
i have to rely on the labs .
so we need to run the lactate again ,
and if it &apos;s above 6 , we &apos;re going to do the surgery .
and if it &apos;s not , we &apos;re not .
hey , where &apos;s brian ?
who &apos;s brian ?
bed three .
broken ribs .
dead fianc .
oh ! him . mm @-@ hmm .
um , he left . one of his friends is still missing .
all right . uh , listen up , guys .
you wanna do something for your friends that are hurt ?
sure .
how about donating some blood ?
we can do that .
all right , just line up behind these doctors ,
and they &apos;re gonna help you out .
that way , they &apos;re tied to the table and they can &apos;t take off .
i &apos;ll give some blood .
i &apos;ll help the blood bank staff get set up .
were you out at the pile ?
yeah .
do you know if 5818 shore drive is still standing ?
it &apos;s my patient &apos;s house , and she &apos;s worried .
sharpie lady &apos;s here ?
sharpie lady ?
i was evacuating her when the mudslide happened ,
and she runs back in her house .
i lose it on her , &apos; cause i &apos;m thinking
she &apos;s looking for her wallet or something ,
and i &apos;m like ,
&quot; lady , that crap can be replaced . &quot;
and she comes running out with a sharpie
and immediately starts digging guys out
and taking their vitals .
that &apos;s why her fingers are crushed .
i feel kinda bad for yelling at her .
yeah .
what &apos;s wrong ?
crown molding &apos;s a badass .
i was just thinking about
when richard caught me living in the limb room .
i was a resident .
before george . anyway ...
i was in there one night ,
and he--richard walked in on me dancing in my underwear .
i was so embarrassed .
i mean ... he was the chief .
are you okay ?
no . no , i &apos;m ...
no , i don &apos;t dance in my underwear anymore .
lactate &apos;s 9 .
go .
you agree with meredith &apos;s decision ?
i think it was a coin toss .
you gonna be in there with bailey ?
yeah .
okay , if he has abnormal bleeding ,
give him factor vii .
he responds to it well .
okay .
and make sure his pulses are checked hourly .
that is really important . you wanna write that down ?
no , i think i ...
you know , let me put that in your phone .
you &apos;re a challenging person .
i know .
the swelling is bad .
shepherd &apos;s had to open up a bigger chunk of her skull .
there &apos;s no way she &apos;s getting out of this without major deficits .
what are you doing ?
heather &apos;s hemorrhaging .
yeah , i heard .
she could die .
all right , look , don &apos;t go there .
she &apos;s my age , my class .
her locker &apos;s right next to mine .
i used her deodorant without telling her ,
and she could die .
i know . it sucks .
it all sucks .
mm . wait , wait . this is bad . we shouldn &apos;t .
yeah .
but i want to .
okay .
wait .
did you have sex with any of my friends in this closet ?
okay . no . this isn &apos;t happening .
i gotta go .
i was just gonna get some lidocaine ,
but i &apos;m not gonna slip on a used condom , am i ?
screw you .
did you hear the news about me being a big slut got out ?
yeah .
it &apos;s mortifying .
but , you know , i mean , i think that--
i think that we &apos;re gonna be okay .
you know , i @-@ i think--i think it &apos;s gonna make us stronger .
you know , like a bone .
you know , sometimes you-- you have to--
you have to break it in order for it to heal correctly .
and i think that maybe callie and i ...
that &apos;s what i was gonna tell callie .
like , um , an ortho metaphor ?
what do you think ?
i think you should stick to
&quot; i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m such a slut . &quot;
yeah . good call .
hey , mrs. ashford .
you wanna press against my hands with the bottoms of your feet ?
i heard you &apos;re kind of a hero .
oh , my god .
mrs. ashford .
i could use some help over here !
you &apos;re gonna be good , dougie ,
okay ? you &apos;re gonna be fine .
douglas lauenstein , multiple crush injuries ,
b.p. 105 over 72 .
get him up to trauma 3 . hey , where do you think you &apos;re going ?
sash , we got him .
he was still in the rig .
is he gonna be okay ?
yeah , he &apos;s gonna be okay , but i gotta head back out .
we &apos;re trying to stabilize the area ,
make sure we don &apos;t lose any more houses .
you &apos;re not going anywhere . you &apos;re still bleeding .
well , just patch me up .
no , i already did that .
well , maybe this guy can help .
all right , sasha , we just got your studies back ,
and this is necrotizing fasciitis .
it is aggressive ,
and we need to get you up to surgery right away .
how--how did i--
uh , the water and the mud that you were stuck in .
both of those are breeding grounds for this type
of bacteria .
well , wait--
it &apos;s a flesh @-@ eating bacteria , brian , all right ?
what &apos;s most important is that
we get her prepped and ready right away . let &apos;s go .
a doctor puts on his white coat to save lives ,
defy death , but once he takes it off ,
he &apos;s vulnerable ,
just like anybody else .
human .
ma &apos;am ...
i &apos;m dr. kepner .
i worked on your husband .
would you like to see him ?
okay .
we &apos;re all gonna die .
we don &apos;t get much say over how or when .
his ring .
thought you &apos;d want it back .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
but we do get to decide how we &apos;re gonna live .
so do it .
decide .
is this the life you want to live ?
is this the person you want to love ?
is this the best you can be ?
can you be stronger ?
kinder ?
be a good friend .
tell me i made the right decision .
more compassionate ?
you made the right decision .
oh , damn it . there &apos;s blood in the temporal horn .
i &apos;m gonna have to do a temporal lobectomy .
dr. shepherd .
she &apos;ll have motor and memory deficits if you--
i &apos;m trying to save her life .
this is my fault .
shane .
no , i did this .
you didn &apos;t do anything . this is not your fault .
this just happened .
now i can &apos;t have you in here if you can &apos;t hold it together .
can you be in here ?
decide .
yeah .
dissectors .
breathe in .
tell me again .
breathe out .
you made the right decision .
and decide .
10 blade .
the waiting can kill you .
you make a decision ,
and then the world has to turn .
the consequences unfold ...
out of your hands .
there &apos;s only one thing that seems clear ...
in those quiet moments while you wait .
whatever you chose was wrong .
you think he put you in his will ?
no .
next of kin .
maybe you get the house .
i have a house .
well , you can give me his house . i mean , i could use a house .
he &apos;s not my father .
i &apos;ve been telling him this for years .
he just feels guilty
because he busted up my parents &apos; marriage .
that &apos;s not my problem .
it is now .
yeah , i mean , sticking me with his end of life care--
doesn &apos;t ask , doesn &apos;t give me an out--
that &apos;s real love .
well , it sounds like family to me .
maybe he is your father . banged your mom enough .
alex .
did they know each other before you were born ?
they met when i was 3 .
mm @-@ hmm . yeah . that &apos;s what they told you .
i gotta get back to the e.r.
ow . oh , no , no . let me get it .
this is yang .
and how about brooks ?
i know . i &apos;m fine .
hey , look . i need to run to my nec fasc surgery .
he &apos;s in cardiogenic shock .
no .
bailey feels like there &apos;s likely some internal necrosis .
so she took him up to the o.r.
with this kind of cardiac compromise ?
yeah--and she--
unh @-@ unh . she--mom . mom ?
look ...
i need hunt in here .
i can try to--
now !
ready ? go . two , three ...
bowels are completely clean .
should we recheck the pelvis ?
i have , four times .
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing--
cutting open a man in cardiogenic shock
with nothing on his c.t. ?
there &apos;s dead tissue somewhere inside him .
i &apos;d like to find it before it kills him .
he can &apos;t handle this stress
until his cardiac status is stabilized !
get him off that table !
lap pad , please .
dr. hunt !
dr. avery , i &apos;m gonna have to ask you
to keep it down while we &apos;re doing our work .
huh , there &apos;s a surprise for you .
pressure &apos;s dropping . is his dopamine maxed out ?
yeah , it &apos;s at 20 .
close the patient !
come on . where are you ?
dr. hunt ! brooks is crashing .
bailey , he &apos;s having runs of v @-@ tach .
close ... him ... up !
closing .
can you get by without me ?
just go .
hey , how &apos;s it going with brooks ?
hey , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
you gotta drink the juice , man .
you give us half your blood and head back to the pile ,
you &apos;re gonna pass out .
heather didn &apos;t make it .
come on .
i &apos;m gonna give the interns the rest of the night off .
can you give me a hand if there &apos;s anything they drop ?
of course .
i &apos;m so sorry about heather .
yeah .
dr. hunt , lydia &apos;s desatting ,
decreased breath sounds on the left .
wha--
sharpie lady .
oh . should i throw in a chest tube ?
dr. yang is gonna take over that case .
why ? i can handle a chest tube .
oh , my god .
i got a woman with necrotizing fasciitis ,
and the interns aren &apos;t operating .
so can you--
of course .
well , she &apos;s already on the table ,
and the anesthesiologists are lining her up .
be ready in ten .
okay . hey ...
it &apos;s just terrible .
jackson .
oh , hey . i &apos;m sorry .
and what about richard ?
still critical ,
but his pressure stabilized once bailey closed .
so bailey closed because his vitals tanked ,
or because catherine avery was in the gallery screaming ?
oh , derek .
you heard about brooks ?
i can &apos;t believe it .
can we have a conversation ?
not now .
i know you &apos;re mad .
and telling everyone-- i guess ...
i deserved that .
but we could just--
i said not now .
hey , it &apos;s right behind me !
are you headed back out ?
be careful , okay ?
it was avery , right ?
he &apos;s the guy that you ...
i get it . he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy .
practically runs the hospital .
matthew--
and i proposed to you in front of a hundred people .
i didn &apos;t really give you the opportunity to say &quot; no . &quot;
so ...
did you want to say &quot; no &quot; ?
callie ?
callie ?
callie ? !
we got the clot out ,
but there was just so much swelling .
couldn &apos;t get it to stop .
did you tell the family ?
yeah , i had someone call her mom when we found her
and tell her that she was injured .
she &apos;s coming down from someplace in oregon .
i just didn &apos;t want to tell her
when she was still on the road .
okay , so you need to go to the day care
and pick up zola because she &apos;s gonna think
we had a baby and forgot about her .
i &apos;ll call the babysitter and tell her
to meet you at the house in an hour .
and you should tell the interns
to hang out and wait till heather &apos;s mom arrives .
give me the baby .
okay .
i know .
that is a lot of blood .
should i book an o.r. ?
no , not yet .
we &apos;ll monitor her for the next couple of hours
and then decide .
my--my house .
ma &apos;am , you &apos;ve lost quite a lot of blood .
you should rest .
i @-@ i wouldn &apos;t worry about the house right now .
you can &apos;t scream at my doctors when there is
an open body on the table .
i can &apos;t believe you let her talk you into
a boondoggle like that .
dr. avery , if you have any issues with--
does he know why you cut open a man in severe cardiac distress
just so you could poke around and see what &apos;s going on ?
we looked at all of the options .
tell him .
you tell him you feel guilty
because the last thing richard webber heard from you
is that he &apos;s a drunk who ruined your life ,
after all he &apos;s done for you .
we talk on the phone for an hour every night .
it came up .
you feel bad , go find a priest .
but do not try to fix it with a hail mary .
that very well may kill the man !
i want acces to his charts ... right now .
i &apos;ll be back in about an hour .
heather &apos;s mother won &apos;t probably be here yet ,
but if she is , uh , someone stay with her
until i get back .
we don &apos;t tell her , do we ?
no , i will .
just think of some good heather stories .
once she knows ,
she &apos;s gonna want to know that she died among friends .
who &apos;s gonna wait ?
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t . she &apos;ll see it in my face .
what the hell is his problem ? it &apos;s not like they were friends .
i am not waiting with her alone .
i &apos;m not either .
okay . nobody goes . we all wait .
now go find shane and tell him we &apos;re doing this together .
what are you , my mother ? you find him .
yes , yes , yes .
hey .
hey , can you watch her for a minute ?
yeah .
i need to get my laptop .
come here .
what &apos;s going on ?
my wife &apos;s an s @-@ l @-@ u @-@ t .
sofia and i are spending the night at a hotel .
and then what ?
i don &apos;t know . okay , i &apos;ll be right back .
we &apos;re gonna let her stay at a hotel ?
so is this the woman
whose fiance is also a firefighter ,
but they couldn &apos;t find him for a while ?
yep .
forceps .
wow , this wound is really deep .
to get good margins , we &apos;re gonna have to--
i got it .
you are one sleepy girl .
i &apos;m gonna get you to bed right now .
i was gonna go to a hotel .
but mer said i should come here .
well , i guess i should have read those five text messages .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . sofia &apos;s asleep in zola &apos;s bed--
and i @-@ i can move her . she--
she probably won &apos;t wake up .
yeah , okay .
catherine may be right . i mean , it &apos;s possible
i &apos;m too close to this to see it clearly .
am i supposed to be seeing this clearly ?
well , yang was advocating for a more conservative approach .
i guess that &apos;s what we go with .
catherine &apos;s reviewing his chart--
labs , i don &apos;t know .
if she wants to make the decisions ,
then maybe she should .
here you go .
thanks .
hey , how is she doing ?
well , i @-@ i put in the chest tube .
one of her broken ribs sliced into her lung .
so , i mean , she put out a lot of blood .
we &apos;re watching her .
okay .
how are you ?
fabulous .
yeah .
what ?
nothing .
what ?
i @-@ i just ...
i wish i had known it was gonna be
the last time you and i were together .
i would have done things a little differently .
well , was the last time bad ?
no , the last time was wednesday ,
when we knocked that plate off the counter ,
and i spent half the night pulling shards of glass
out of your foot .
that was not the last time .
it was ?
not our best work .
well , that &apos;s awful .
after the kind of run we had ...
it &apos;s just a shame .
shameful .
everyone i love either cheats on me or dies .
callie ...
or cheats on me and dies .
george did both .
arizona &apos;s not gonna die .
yeah , that doesn &apos;t make me feel any better .
ugh . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m drinking all your wine .
you should be drinking all your wine
after what you went through tonight with heather and ...
and richard , oh , my god !
why is everything so horrible ?
please , it &apos;s okay . go ahead .
it &apos;s all yours .
okay .
i &apos;ll open another bottle .
just page her !
i can &apos;t page someone 911 without the name of the patient--
andrea .
when dr. torres calls in , she &apos;ll expect to know who--
no , there &apos;s no patient . just page her .
we can &apos;t page 911 without a patient emergency .
look at me . does it look like this is not an emergency ?
hey , hey ! what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i need you to page callie 911 .
why ?
because she took off with my baby ,
and i don &apos;t know where ,
and when i call her , she doesn &apos;t pick up .
all right , did she ...
no , just do it !
so we were able to remove all of the necrotic tissue ,
but the labs suggest
that your organs are beginning to fail .
well , is there anything that you can do ?
well , we &apos;re giving you some powerful antibiotics .
and we &apos;re hoping that that stops the process .
but ...
but i might not make it .
we are going to do everything that we possibly can .
bri ...
we want to get married now .
right now no matter what happens ,
we want to be married .
we need a chaplain .
hey , bailey .
arizona is in the lobby
screaming at nurses .
why ?
&apos;cause she has no idea where callie is ...
or the baby .
oh , well , you need to tell her they &apos;re at my house .
callie &apos;s not a battered woman .
we &apos;re not harboring her until she gets a restraining order .
she just wants some space .
but you don &apos;t think arizona &apos;s called her ,
like , 300 times ?
if callie wanted her to know where she was ,
she &apos;d have-- she &apos;d have told her .
you think it &apos;s okay that arizona
doesn &apos;t know where her baby is ?
she &apos;s sofia &apos;s mom , too .
they &apos;re both our friends .
you know , we shouldn &apos;t take sides .
it &apos;s not taking sides to tell arizona where her kid is .
oh , you think that &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna go ?
what happened to your hair ?
she wasn &apos;t funny funny , but she was weird funny .
we &apos;re not saying that to her mom .
remember when she swallowed that marble ?
we could talk about that .
her mom knows she swallowed a marble , idiot .
you know what ?
when you have a better idea , you let me know .
you were her roommate .
how do you not have a single nice story about her ?
she took my white sweater and returned it pink .
she left the apartment without waking me up
when we both had rounds , which she knew about and said ,
&quot; i didn &apos;t want to bother you . you looked so peaceful . &quot;
she &apos;d drink all the milk
and return the empty carton back in the fridge .
then why are you all red @-@ eyed and puffy ?
we weren &apos;t soul mates .
it doesn &apos;t mean i wanted her dead .
what &apos;s going on with the baby ?
oh , nothing . he &apos;s fine .
they have him in the nursery .
oh . oh . i thought--
i thought something happened .
no , no .
i paged you because i wanted to let you know
that callie and sofia are going to stay at my place tonight .
i think she just needs some space .
she needs to cool off . and ... i know
you &apos;re not gonna go run over there or anything ,
but i just thought you would like to know
that she and the baby are--
arizona .
arizona ? !
is &quot; i told you so &quot; inappropriate ?
shut it .
come on . what about ... hassan ?
he &apos;s out at the pile , too ?
you realize they can &apos;t all be out at the damn pile .
no , i don &apos;t care what religion they are .
just give me somebody--anybody that can officiate this--
yeah , as a member of the board , i &apos;m gonna say
you want to stay away from phrases like ,
&quot; even a catholic . &quot;
all right , uh , just call me back .
how is richard ?
hanging by a thread . thank you very much .
you gonna scream at me , too , now ?
i heard you already had a go at hunt and bailey .
i just wanna know what in god &apos;s name
was going on through your head--
stop !
you are terrified . i get that .
you love him .
and you are as scared as you have ever been .
marching through this hospital
telling everybody they are incompetent
is not gonna fix that situation .
we are all doing our best .
and we are gonna take good care of him .
and we ... are gonna take good care of you .
okay ?
as soon as he &apos;s stable ...
as soon as the storm passes ,
i &apos;m going to move him to another hospital .
i &apos;m gonna do a thoracotomy on lydia .
just waiting for an o.r. to open up .
okay .
so thanks for ... before .
&quot; thanks &quot; ?
are you gonna send a card on pretty stationery ?
i &apos;m just glad ...
that we &apos;ve given each other a better last memory .
what ?
i don &apos;t know .
if we &apos;d really thought it through ,
then for the last time we &apos;d have--
what ?
is he in there ?
i can &apos;t see anything .
keep your voices down . she &apos;s sleeping .
no , she &apos;s not .
oh . sorry , um ,
we were just looking for dr. shepherd .
he &apos;s not here .
he &apos;ll be back . he went to take zola home .
what do you need ?
he asked us to come up with something nice to say
about heather to her mom for after she knows .
we &apos;re having trouble coming up with
something that &apos;s appropriate .
we were thinking if we looked at
some of the cases she worked on with dr. shepherd ,
we could talk about those .
her mother is not gonna give a crap
about her glioblastoma .
she wants to hear about how you loved her
and how she was like your family .
nothing ?
doesn &apos;t have to be deep .
when my friend george died , i told his mother a story
about how he stole us all jell @-@ o cups .
and then he dropped them all over the floor
and made a huge mess .
and then he tried to clean it up
with those blue bed pads , which only made it worse
because , of course , those blue bed pads
aren &apos;t absorbent at all .
it &apos;s not a sonnet , but it made her smile .
and then she went back to crying .
okay .
asleep ?
what do you think ?
my mother &apos;s planning on moving richard to another hospital .
what ?
i know .
i know you weren &apos;t sure about how to handle
richard &apos;s medical decisions , but i &apos;m just telling you ,
you turn the reins over to her ,
that &apos;s exactly what she &apos;s gonna do with them .
okay ... get me a wheelchair .
you just had a splenectomy and a child .
i &apos;m not putting you in a wheelchair .
jackson , just get me a wheelchair .
there are no chaplains anywhere in the building .
everyone is out dealing with storm victims .
we have storm victims right here .
what--chaplains are supposed to stay here !
anybody seen my patient brian ?
firefighter , busted ribs ...
yeah , he &apos;s getting married .
not without a chaplain , he &apos;s not .
well , i can go online and get certified by
that place on the internet , but me and weddings ,
today-- i don &apos;t think that i &apos;m the best choice .
the damn firefighters keep taking off--injured .
if you see any of them ,
tell them to stay in their damn beds .
kepner .
what ?
get me a wheelchair .
april !
i don &apos;t think we can be friends .
really ?
this will keep happening .
i ...
really wanted to be able to work with you .
yeah , of course .
but if we ...
you know , talk on the phone or ...
grab lunch ...
just because i &apos;m the one
who said it was time ...
doesn &apos;t mean this is easy for me .
i know .
this is not easy for me .
what do you really believe
is the best course of treatment ?
it &apos;s not that simple .
yes , it is .
you always taught us , when you know , you know .
i think there is something in there ,
and no matter how much it stresses his heart ,
i think letting it get worse is worse .
hi . this is dr. grey .
i need to book an o.r. for an exploratory laparotomy .
surgeon is bailey .
patient is webber .
they &apos;re opening him up again .
yep . don &apos;t say anything .
i &apos;m not .
she thought it was a stupid idea the first time
and even more stupid the second time .
you &apos;re the one who has to decide
what richard would want . wouldn &apos;t want to be you .
thanks .
but to be clear ,
when you &apos;re making these decisions for me ,
give my heart at least 24 hours to recover
before you cut me stem to stern .
you just couldn &apos;t hold it in , could you ?
wait , she &apos;s your health care proxy ?
i get to make the decisions for everyone .
not qwen ?
no .
who &apos;s yours ?
i never filled out the forms .
i had the papers back when it was gonna be izzie .
that was a bad plan .
that was all a bad plan .
why do you think i never turned them in ?
mer could be yours , too .
you think i make the wrong decisions all the time .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re selling me to him .
will you stop being so insecure ?
just because i disagree with you
doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t respect what you think .
i can hold more than one point of view in my mind .
i am mature .
i don &apos;t believe you .
you can be mine .
health care proxy ? really ?
i mean , mer &apos;s got enough to take care of .
you want extraordinary measures
or should i just unplug you ?
use your judgment .
sharpie lady &apos;s ready .
mom !
you knew they were taking him back into the o.r. ?
right , now you can &apos;t march in there and shut &apos; em down .
the hell i can &apos;t .
he didn &apos;t choose you to make his decisions .
he chose meredith .
how &apos;s the e.r. ?
quiet for a while .
but we got a couple of ambulances on their way in--
people they pulled out of the pile .
can i come ?
no , no . you &apos;re supposed to be working .
i don &apos;t need the night out .
we &apos;re supposed to be sitting around
telling heather stories .
turns out we &apos;re not a very tight group .
you think you &apos;re not .
but when it all hits the fan ...
you &apos;ll be glad you have &apos; em .
someone just died . shouldn &apos;t this be the time ?
come on .
you &apos;re not gonna go cry to them when we break up ...
and you have to move your trash bag full of crap
out of my house ?
okay , one--
i never leave more than a change of underwear
and a toothbrush in anyone else &apos;s house .
that &apos;s smart .
and two--i will have dumped your sorry ass ,
so i &apos;m not gonna be crying .
i &apos;m just gonna feel bad
that i made it so you can never love again .
oh , yeah . it &apos;s gonna be ugly .
but see ...
i &apos;ve got mer and cristina .
i can cry to them .
when the next guy after me breaks your heart ...
i &apos;m gonna want my bitches .
voila ! this--it &apos;ll help .
brian and sasha ...
your commitment
to each other is an inspiration .
your love , your devotion-- it &apos;s unwavering .
you aren &apos;t swayed by anything
that life puts in your path .
when people talk about marriage ,
this is exactly what they oughta have in mind .
i can &apos;t believe i yelled at a woman
who clawed dying victims out of the mud
and triaged them with her bleeding little hands .
super tacky .
i think i &apos;m the worst person i &apos;ve ever met .
shut up .
it speaks .
it wants more booze .
all right .
all right , we all have to focus .
heather .
she was a fine , upstanding citizen
with limitless potential .
you say that to my mom when i &apos;m dead ,
and she &apos;s gonna know you &apos;re lying .
my mom will believe it .
you can say it when i &apos;m dead .
write it down &apos; cause i &apos;m gonna forget .
that i was a nice person ?
how is it that we spend this much time together
and we don &apos;t really know anything about each other ?
so tell us something we don &apos;t know .
about me ?
don &apos;t be shy .
what ?
i can &apos;t .
you guys are gonna hate me more than you already do .
no , we won &apos;t .
circle of trust .
my mom knew mark sloan .
the one who died ?
they , like , dated a hundred years ago or something .
and he kind of helped me get into the program .
what ? !
i knew it .
i knew you didn &apos;t make it in here on your own .
you are such an evil cow .
whatever .
at least i got in here on my own merit .
what happened to the circle of trust ?
i was a street kid .
foster homes , lived in my car .
you were not .
hand to god .
really ? do you know how to pickpocket ?
no . i wasn &apos;t oliver twist .
could you teach me how to shoplift ?
no !
it &apos;ll help me in the o.r. calm hands under pressure .
you couldn &apos;t handle it .
you could .
thank you .
i ... went through college on a cheerleading scholarship .
what ? !
no !
yes .
that is my child !
okay , so i can screw some whore on shore leave ,
but this is over the line ?
i could have called the police on you--
okay , and now she &apos;s your baby .
i had to talk you into even considering having a child .
and i had to talk you into marriage .
yeah , because i knew it would be a mistake .
and you know what ? it was .
you cannot take a baby and just disappear ...
look at the stars and the sky light .
yeah ? yeah , should we go ups--
let &apos;s go to the swing . should we go to the swing ?
okay . go to the swing .
go to the swing . let &apos;s go to the swing .
we are excited , united ...
and here to win the fight .
we &apos;re here to meet you , defeat you ...
we dominate tonight !
tigers ...
tigers ...
tigers .
tigers .
tigers .
excuse me ,
somebody said you might be able to help me
find my daughter
heather brooks .
we have run this bowel four times now ,
and there is nothing there .
i don &apos;t know how much longer we can keep at this .
come on .
i know you &apos;re in there .
owen .
oh , my god .
the pancreas . look at that .
that &apos;s all necrotic tissue hiding underneath .
get her some forceps , please .
and--and a 15 @-@ blade .
here you go , doctor .
somebody call meredith grey up in maternity .
on it .
tell her , &quot; when you know , you know &quot; !
it was a beautiful wedding .
what you said--
can we not ?
why are you snapping at me all day ?
i &apos;m not snapping .
yeah , you are .
i &apos;m sorry i asked the question .
it obviously made you really uncomfortable ,
and i guess that &apos;s my answer .
there &apos;s no need to beat a dead horse .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s supposed to look like , you know .
i mean , they can &apos;t even imagine not being together .
do you see the difference between that
and &quot; i think i &apos;ll marry this guy ,
or maybe i &apos;ll marry that guy ,
who i banged in a bathroom
because i flipped out over my boards ,
but when he was into me , i couldn &apos;t handle it .
but suddenly , when he almost dies ,
i can &apos;t live without him . &quot;
that is so unfair !
it &apos;s what happened !
you didn &apos;t want me when i was okay--
when i wanted you .
no , you just want me now
because you are in something that is real ...
and that--
that scares the crap out of you .
marry this guy because you want to make a life with him ,
or don &apos;t , and move on .
but none of this has to do with me .
no , this is ...
entirely about you .
i &apos;m very sorry about how i spoke to you yesterday .
with the storm and everything , and we &apos;re all just ...
your house ...
it didn &apos;t make it , did it ?
i &apos;m sorry .
you saved a lot of people triaging like you did .
were you a doctor or something ?
no , i &apos;ve just lived on the side of the mountain
for a long time . it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s not our first storm .
an ex @-@ marine showed me how to do it ...
our first mudslide .
oh , i can &apos;t believe i have to build that house again .
maybe you should find someplace else .
no . we &apos;re a few houses on the side of a mountain ,
and we take care of each other .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;d find new friends .
no one else would have me .
she was really good .
fast hands .
one time ...
we &apos;d all been working all night ,
and we were starving ,
and she went to where they make the food trays
for the patients ,
and she stole jell @-@ o cups for all of us .
and they fell all over the floor .
she tried to use one of those blue hospital pads
to clean it up , but it just made it worse .
got everywhere .
jo told heather that
she swiped an apple from a grocery store
when she was a kid .
and heather asked her to teach her how to shoplift .
she thought it would improve her surgical technique .
you must have been close .
april , i really don &apos;t have time for this .
please just-- just ... please .
i want to accept your proposal ...
in private ,
without anybody pressuring me to say &quot; yes . &quot;
and i want to do it in front of god .
actually--actually , no , you know what ? no .
i @-@ i &apos;m not accepting your proposal ,
i am proposing to you .
i want to be your wife .
i think you need to think some stuff out .
i did .
okay .
yes , it was jackson .
and ... yes , i @-@ i have feelings for him .
he &apos;s always gonna be a part of my life .
and that gets confusing sometimes ,
especially when he &apos;s
pulling babies out of burning buses .
but ...
i ... i @-@ i &apos;m not good at this .
i--this is all new to me .
okay , i was never the girl that got picked at the dance .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m not good at it ,
and i &apos;m indecisive
because i see eight sides of everything .
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re picking when you pick me .
and you may not want that .
i thought maybe nobody would ever want that .
april--
but i ... i want you .
i want to marry you .
so will you marry me ?
sofia is downstairs in the day care .
i &apos;m sorry i called you a baby @-@ snatcher .
i was upset ,
and i shouldn &apos;t have spoken to you like that .
you were just trying to cool off ,
and that was the right thing to do--
sofia and i will be staying at mer &apos;s again tonight .
that &apos;ll be two nights with me .
you can take her the following two nights .
and we &apos;ll switch off like that
until we can figure out a real schedule .
well , how long is-- is this gonna be going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
dr. ben warren ,
this is your wife .
sorry ... i keep missing you . it &apos;s--
it &apos;s been ...
something happened with richard--
a health situation .
i got involved in that .
he &apos;s still unconscious .
i don &apos;t know how he &apos;s going to ...
but he &apos;s alive .
heather &apos;s uncle just arrived .
he &apos;s with her mom , and her brother &apos;s on his way .
thank you for staying with her .
go home . get some rest .
you need to tell your guys
to stop going out to the damn pile if they &apos;re injured .
i keep patching up the same damn guys .
i could tell &apos; em , but it &apos;s not gonna make any difference .
they can &apos;t just sit around .
it ... makes them nuts .
all right , try harder !
where &apos;s the rig ?
you okay ? you sure ?
okay . out back .
hey , sir ?
can i ride out there with you guys ?
sure .
what are you doing ? shane !
shane , you &apos;re not a firefighter !
shane !
stupid .
damn it .
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re his people . we have to go .
uh , actually , no , we don &apos;t . we &apos;re
not trained--
sharpie lady helped .
sharpie lady almost got herself killed .
we have to go .
i don &apos;t know what the deal is with him and heather .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s their weird competition thing .
or maybe they were having secret sex in the bathrooms .
i don &apos;t care . whatever it is ,
shane hasn &apos;t said a single word since she died ,
and we &apos;re what he has . we &apos;re what we have .
maybe we get through this program normal .
or maybe we end up cranky , work @-@ obsessed people
who live on the side of a mountain
and have no family or children ,
and we only have each other
because no one else can stand us .
what is she talking--
get up !
e @-@ everything okay ?
yeah . yeah , uh ,
meredith just wants me to hang out at her house .
zola needs some attention .
and derek is pretty wiped out .
callie and sofia are there , so ...
is there anything i can do ? i mean , i could , uh ...
good night .
yeah .
zola is asleep .
all right , little miss ...
in five minutes , it &apos;s your turn .
to be clear , i am happy to do the dishes ,
but there is no universe in which i generate dinner .
all right , we &apos;ll figure it out .
mac and cheese .
oh , no , we had that last night .
well , and it was good . right ? it was good .
oh , thank you .
i &apos;m sorry to bother everybody .
no , it &apos;s okay .
can i see her for just a minute ?
you saw her this afternoon . you can get her tomorrow night .
i know .
but cou--
you can see her when it &apos;s your night .
i could , uh ... i could just take her on the--
on the front porch for a minute ,
and i &apos;m not gonna take her .
do you have any idea how confusing this is for her ?
yeah , i realize that .
well , you know what ?
she &apos;s supposed to be in bed right now .
how am i supposed to get her to sleep
with you coming and going ?
five minutes .
are you kidding me ?
she shows up here with this act ,
and you &apos;re just gonna take her side ?
callie--
it &apos;s an act .
callie , look at me .
i &apos;m your friend .
five minutes .
come here , sofia .
come here , baby . okay . yeah .
whee ! come on , baby .
we just want to survive the storm .
i missed you so much .
we pray ,
&quot; please , god , just get me to the other side . &quot;
we never imagine what it &apos;ll be like when we get there .
i love you so much .
and i miss you every second .
&apos;cause you &apos;re my girl .
what if when the storm passes , nothing &apos;s left ?
i always said i could handle anything .
i was wrong .
i was wrong about a lot of things .
i think there &apos;s no harm in getting another opinion .
was i or was i not correct ?
why does that make you feel so threatened ?
you know , i &apos;m another opinion , and i have to tip my hat .
dr. bailey called it .
nobody said it wasn &apos;t good to deal with the pancreas ,
but he is still clearly unstable .
he hasn &apos;t regained consciousness--
none of that is unusual .
i would like to bring in another person--
somebody that could tell us
i will make the decision .
you &apos;ve said what you think , and then you said it again .
and i will take that under advisement .
dr. grey--
he picked you to be his girlfriend .
and we &apos;re all very happy about that .
but he picked me to be his family .
and you walked away from that responsibility
the second that--
no one said i would be good at it .
and he knew that . but he picked me anyway .
i &apos;m the family .
meredith .
please , don &apos;t get involved .
but i was right about one thing .
