gossip girl here ,
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
my mom &apos;s filing for divorce .
i &apos;d love the chance to talk to her
so she could see for herself just how much i &apos;ve changed .
i should hear your father out .
really nice seeing your mother up here after all this time .
yeah .
just in time , too , right ?
just in time for what ?
your father &apos;s parole .
serena and colin are over . do not continue
to jeopardize her future .
if only he were the only teacher
serena had an inappropriate relationship with .
serena &apos;s in the hospital .
oh , my god . you drugged her ? that was not part of the plan .
look , this isn &apos;t just about you anymore .
i was wondering if you wanted to discuss
a place for her recovery .
ostroff center .
your daughter wakes up alone , drugged ,
in an empty motel room , and you just have her committed .
juliet may have been behind serena &apos;s overdose .
what do you say we find that bitch
and get us a little frontier justice ?
西林 明娴 range henry
spotted--dan and blair exiting sat ambroeus
with espresso doppio for two , but we hear it &apos;s not
the caffeine that &apos;s got them talking a mile a minute .
it &apos;s a mission .
so juliet dressed up like serena
at saints and sinners to destroy her relationships
with me and nate .
and enlists vanessa and jenny to mess with me .
which is devious and pathetic , but let &apos;s face it ,
around here , it &apos;s just another saturday night .
well , you can &apos;t show up at a masked ball and not expect
at least one social @-@ climbing doppelganger
to try and impersonate you .
but then , according to jenny , juliet posted a photo of herself
as serena doing coke .
and for that , she will be judged by a higher power , but we &apos;ve
we &apos;ve seen worse .
well , i was gonna say &quot; done worse , &quot; but yes .
okay , but then ... serena wakes up in a motel room
after almost o.d.ing.
and that is where the &quot; juliet express &quot;
goes off the rails and heads straight for crazy town .
the next thing we know , serena wakes up ,
insists she didn &apos;t go on a bender .
but then the photo shows up online , and she starts
to doubt herself and checks herself into the ostroff ,
which brings us up to the present .
the thing we need to figure out is why .
i mean , colin , nate , hamilton house ?
none of that explains taking things so far .
well , as someone well @-@ acquainted with the darker human emotions ,
let me offer my theory .
there is only one motive powerful enough to fuel
a gaslighting like this , and that is retribution .
retribution for what ?
i know i &apos;ve already said this ,
but i &apos;m really proud of you , and so is mom .
is that why she &apos;s here , to tell me herself ?
do i even wanna know where she is ?
she and chuck are meeting with a reporter
from &quot; the post &quot; this morning , some profile on bass industries .
oh , &quot; the post , &quot; because they have such
award @-@ winning business coverage .
oh , don &apos;t tell me you detect a whiff of edu damage control .
mom &apos;s classic scent brings back
the fondest memories of childhood .
i am way ahead of you there ,
but when i confronted her about it , she didn &apos;t deny it .
bass industries is a family @-@ run company ,
and like it or not , what the family does
affects what people think about it .
i know i &apos;ve put her in a tough position ,
but please promise me that you &apos;ll try to keep her honest
about where i am and what &apos;s going on .
no stories about aunt carol &apos;s
in miami like when you were here .
i @-@ i am on it , although that marlins jersey
that bart bass bought me that year for christmas
would look great on you .
serena , eric .
so ... have you made a decision ?
what do you mean , no visitors ?
i don &apos;t think you realize who we are .
who she thinks she is , is more like . look , i &apos;m family .
i &apos;m serena &apos;s brother , or stepbrother , technically ,
which i do mostly try to put out of my mind
seeing as we dated pretty seriously--
humphrey , they treat people in here
for less serious complexes than that .
do you wanna get committed ? i &apos;ll just call her .
i &apos;m sure that we &apos;re on her list .
there is no list ,
and her phone is locked away in a drawer somewhere .
look , serena &apos;s doctor recommended
that she start her treatment with 72 hours , no contact .
that includes me , my mom , and you guys .
no , but serena doesn &apos;t need to be here .
juliet was behind everything .
and we have some questions for her .
whatever screwy series of events got her in the front door ,
she &apos;s here now , and she &apos;s getting the help .
she &apos;s probably needed for a long time ,
so whatever you &apos;re up to , you need to do it without serena .
looks like someone &apos;s gonna have a busy holiday season .
well , unfortunately , they &apos;re all followed up
by a polite phone call asking if your father will be attending .
or in the case of lily &apos;s holiday party
for bass industries , a handwritten note
saying she hopes i understand .
wow , i guess i always thought the mean girls
got a little nicer once they grew up .
and had kids of their own .
quite the opposite , i &apos;m afraid .
yeah .
but no party is more important than family .
yeah . about that ...
nate , what is it ?
so i really appreciate
everything you &apos;ve been doing for dad , and i , you know ,
wanna make sure he deserved the chance you &apos;re giving him .
so i called the business manager and asked if dad had been
in contact , made any plans for when he got out .
please tell me he didn &apos;t book a one @-@ way flight to the caribbean .
no , but he did ask about leasing a house outside the city .
why wasn &apos;t i told about this ?
he wanted to tell you .
dad begged him not to say anything .
i already said you &apos;d find out soon enough .
it was supposed to be a surprise .
i wish i was surprised .
so he uses our address to get parole ,
then uses my money to get his own place . same old howard .
i &apos;m sorry , mom .
i understand if you don &apos;t wanna go through with this .
i just , you know , i really thought he had changed .
so did i.
i &apos;ll call the lawyers .
i got you into this mess , okay ?
i &apos;ll go to dad . i &apos;ll tell him .
we can &apos;t do nothing for three days .
who knows how far juliet could get in that time ?
yeah , i think we just gotta tell my dad and lily
what juliet did with these pills is against the law .
police and parents ,
of course that &apos;s your plan , humphrey .
or we could sneak in to see serena .
that receptionist got a pretty good look at me ,
but maybe with a wig ...
that &apos;s your plan-- disguises and accents ?
i never said anything about accents . can you do any ?
no , look , eric is right .
we need to leave serena out of this
and just find juliet on our own .
well , colin is her cousin .
we could track him down
at whatever economic summit he &apos;s at this week .
well , nate dated her .
my minions knew her for a whole year
before we showed up .
or ... there is someone
who seems to know everything about everyone .
besides me , who ?
gossip girl ? she &apos;s not a ouija board , humphrey .
you can &apos;t just ask , &quot; where &apos;s juliet ? &quot;
and expect her to point you in the right direction .
maybe you can . look , think about it .
you and serena are her people ,
not juliet .
serena really could have been hurt , and plus
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s furious that juliet sent in that fake photo .
does she even know that it &apos;s fake ?
hey , juliet . it &apos;s good to see you . it &apos;s been a while .
yeah , thanks . it &apos;s good to be home .
this is excruciating . what if she doesn &apos;t respond
and all we &apos;re doing is wasting valuable time ?
our time is not that valuable .
until we know where juliet is ,
we don &apos;t know whether we need to charter a jet
or if your metro card will suffice for our journey .
that &apos;s from her .
open it .
well , i guess we have our mission .
buckle up , kids .
you up for a road trip ?
looks like this unholy alliance is hitting the road .
serena , help me understand .
are you upset because of what you did
or because you can &apos;t remember it ?
both and ... neither .
you know , if you saw
a photo of yourself on the internet doing cocaine ,
what would you think ?
i wouldn &apos;t know what to think . i would never do that .
exactly .
but with me , i can &apos;t be too sure .
you know , i may not remember kissing dan and nate
or--or crossing blair , but ...
you know , this wouldn &apos;t be the first time
that i had been with two guys in one night
or betrayed my best friend .
that never happened .
you &apos;re still a man in my eyes .
i always knew there was something . get out !
things had gotten so out of control ,
i didn &apos;t know how to pull them back anymore .
hey , what &apos;s happening ? are you okay ?
we have to go .
no , we can &apos;t leave him .
there &apos;s drugs everywhere . we can get arrested .
so i left town alone
to cornwall , connecticut ,
to try to start over .
is the pedal to the metal ?
because i swear if i shove my feet through the floor ,
i could run faster . at least there &apos;s no radio ,
so i &apos;m spared your horrid taste in music .
i think we were supposed to turn there .
you know , i &apos;d tell you to stop being such a backseat driver ,
but how can you be one when you don &apos;t even know how to drive ?
i offered to get us a car service--
professional driver , comfortable seats , champagne !
we &apos;re on a mission here .
we need to be able to move at any moment and tail people ,
speed , if necessary .
speed ? ! please . and as for tailing someone ,
a stretch hummer with a hot tub
would be more inconspicuous than this .
first , my dad swapped
a &apos; 69 les paul for this car .
it &apos;s a collector &apos;s item , and second ,
it was either this or the lincoln hawk van ,
which , all i &apos;m saying , has graphics .
fine . we should almost be there .
let me just consult the g.p.s. oh , wait . that &apos;s me .
no , but for real , cornice should be just up here .
thank you so much for your time .
enjoy your holiday .
we really appreciate
&quot; the post &apos;s &quot; interest in the company .
bye .
bye .
ahh . oh , my god . that was punishing .
i think my face actually hurts from smiling so much . drink ?
please . it &apos;s barely afternoon ,
but we &apos;ve earned it .
serena only came up once .
yes , and i kept my promise to eric
to tell the truth .
she is exhausted . i know i am .
i think we both killed it .
you talking about how proud you are
of the work i &apos;ve done at the empire .
and you &apos;re saying what a great job i &apos;ve done
leading the board at bass .
well , i meant what i said .
so do i.
mm , there was that sticky question
of when i might take back the reins of bass industries .
you kind of flinched when she asked you about it .
well , i didn &apos;t see that it was any of her business .
it &apos;s a long ways away ,
and it was off topic .
i will want it back at some point .
you know that , right ?
of course .
it was never my intention
to be anything more than a custodian ,
overseeing the board
until you were ready to do it yourself .
i have to get ready for this party ,
and the caterers are gonna be here any moment to set up ,
so ...
i &apos;ll see you tonight .
it &apos;s a little early in the day for that , don &apos;t you think ?
things not go well ?
no , actually , the interview was , um , fine .
if this is juliet &apos;s house ,
then she is even freakier than we thought .
who pretends to be poor ?
wait a second . i &apos;m not sure what &apos;s supposed to happen right now .
if she is really in there , what &apos;s our plan ?
i mean , what are we gonna do ?
we &apos;re just gonna march up to her
and pull her hair ?
for starters .
take it off .
yeah ! take it off , baby !
oh . at least he &apos;s owning it .
juliet wouldn &apos;t be at a party like this ,
let alone host it .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think this is her house .
well , gossip girl didn &apos;t say it was ,
so don &apos;t just look for juliet .
look for clues .
body shots !
or someone who has one .
damien dalgaard ?
i don &apos;t understand . what changed her mind ?
found out about the rhinebeck house , dad .
you couldn &apos;t even wait two weeks
before you start spending her money ?
that &apos;s what you think ?
nate , your mom and i vacationed at that place
when we were first married .
she said it was her dream house .
i saw it was for lease and i thought ,
wouldn &apos;t it be great if we could get out of the city ,
just the two of us ?
spend some time reconnecting ,
away from all our so @-@ called friends .
i &apos;m sorry . i might have--
jumped to conclusions ? pretty quickly , too .
no , you &apos;re right .
i guess this transition &apos;s gonna be harder
than we thought .
i &apos;ll talk to mom .
don &apos;t bother .
i guess you &apos;re not the only one who assumed
i was incapable of doing something nice .
i was kidding myself .
two of us alone in the country ? two of us together at all ?
it &apos;s been over for a long time .
what does that mean when you get out ? i mean ...
if you don &apos;t come home to mom , are you gonna--
a halfway house ? yes , i am .
dad , you--
nate , coming off of two years behind bars ?
a halfway house sounds pretty good to me .
if you wanna stick around ,
i got tv privileges , and , uh , the game is on .
sure . okay .
how &apos;s your sister ?
she &apos;s good . she &apos;s been living in hudson .
i banished her .
yeah , but it &apos;s been for the best .
listen , we &apos;re not , uh , here for a reunion .
yeah , me neither . i &apos;m working .
connecticut &apos; burbs ,
do big business over the holidays .
college kids come home . school is always reliable .
school ?
yeah . knightley . i went there .
wait . boarding school ?
where you met serena ?
i didn &apos;t make the connection , but of course .
when serena ran away ,
she went to the knightley school in cornwall .
so do you know juliet sharp ?
i do . i saw her in the city about a week ago ,
but whatever this is , uh , i &apos;m not getting involved .
well , if you sold drugs to juliet ,
then you already are .
it was bad . serena ended up in the hospital ,
and she says she didn &apos;t do it to herself .
is she okay ?
she will be .
juliet made a pretty big buy , all right ?
she bought coke , pills ,
even some ether .
i assumed she was throwing a party
for those sorority girls
at whatever house .
ether ?
it &apos;s like a turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ century roofie .
so serena goes to boarding school with damien .
damien sells drugs to juliet .
but what &apos;s the connection between juliet and serena ?
you know what ? why don &apos;t we find her address
and go ask her ourselves ?
this is where i first met juliet .
she &apos;s a townie .
whoa ! watch where you &apos;re going , man !
what &apos;s the deal with the can opener ?
it &apos;s a car from britain . it &apos;s not that weird .
i told him we should park away from the house
so no one would see us getting in it .
oh , shotgun , by the way .
better step on it , juliet ,
because your clean getaway just got very messy .
let the sugar cube melt . drop it in .
extinguish the flame .
and drink up .
whoo ! oh , check it out . i love this song .
serena , wh @-@ what do you think about a b @-@ minus ?
i want an a @-@ plus .
i know . i just think it would seem pretty obvious
if all of a sudden you started getting a &apos;s in spanish .
i thought we were going for more of a gradual improvement .
you &apos;ve been studying harder
and working with a-- with a tutor .
aw , my tutor .
mrs. sharp .
hi . uh , we &apos;re juliet &apos;s friends from new york .
is , uh , is she around ?
oh . um , no , no , she &apos;s out running some errands for me .
i see .
um , i guess we &apos;ll-- we &apos;ll try again later .
or maybe we can come in and wait ?
we &apos;ve been dying to see her , and it was a long ride .
um , sure . sure . come on in .
well , what did you say your names were ?
oh , we didn &apos;t . i &apos;m blair .
this is dan and damien .
i &apos;ll put the kettle on . you guys sit .
um , so do you go to columbia with jules , or ...
i do .
um , but dan goes to n.y.u. ,
and damien &apos;s in the school of life .
i actually know juliet from here .
i went to knightley .
oh . uh , so i @-@ i assume you know our ben .
he was a damn good teacher ,
no matter what they say .
i don &apos;t remember a mr. sharp .
no , no , his last name is donovan--
the same as my first husband .
do you recognize him ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know it was julies &apos;s brother .
well , if i taught at knightley ,
i wouldn &apos;t bring my &quot; mystic pizza &quot; townie family
to school events either .
when serena went back to the city ,
he got fired for sleeping with a student .
everyone was sure it was her .
is , uh , earl grey okay ?
actually , we won &apos;t be able to stay .
so you &apos;re at a new school , but it &apos;s the same old thing--
partying , boys .
yeah , but there was one person there who was different .
mr. donovan , hey .
if you &apos;re wondering ,
no , i don &apos;t plan to drink both of these coffees .
one is actually for you .
it &apos;s , uh , with two creams and no sugar .
i notice that &apos;s how you take it in the dining hall .
thank you .
um , so if you don &apos;t mind , i was , um , wondering ,
i actually have some questions about
arbor imagery in the poems of sylvia plath .
well , i happen to know that will be on the final next week .
so , uh , will you sit down ?
thank you .
yeah , of course .
it felt good to have someone
who paid attention to me for a positive reason ,
and we began to spend more and more time together .
there wasn &apos;t a keg cracked within 10 miles
that serena didn &apos;t know about , then suddenly ,
she started staying home , reading in her room .
the generous conclusion to draw would be that serena
was getting her act together , focusing on school .
yeah , but no one thought that . they assumed she was sleeping
with the handsome , young english teacher .
was she ?
well , i always thought the best about serena , but--
but something made you believe it was true .
i was having dinner with my aunt at the millbrook inn
in poughkeepsie .
as we were heading out , i saw serena
checking in with mr. donovan .
uh , i @-@ i can &apos;t believe we got a flat tire in that weather .
a trip to the mary mccarthy collection
at the vassar library is so not worth it .
ah . why don &apos;t you , uh , dry off and get something to eat ?
and i &apos;ll go take care of that car .
what ? are you kidding ? you &apos;re not going back out there .
you &apos;ll drown .
the tire &apos;s not gonna fix itself .
yeah , but it &apos;ll stop raining by morning .
maybe we could ... get a room .
serena ...
come on . you can &apos;t act like you haven &apos;t thought about it .
the ability to have thoughts and not act on them--
it &apos;s what separates man from beast .
you &apos;re not gonna quote your way out of this .
i know what the stakes are for you . for me , too .
but this is real on both sides ,
and if you deny it , you &apos;re lying .
i &apos;m not a liar .
i &apos;m not gonna deny anything .
i care about you very much , serena ...
which is why i &apos;m going to brave the weather and fix the tire
so i can drive you home
so you can sleep in your own bed tonight .
you know , i think he was the only guy
to ever say no to me . i was in love with him .
well , as in love as i had ever been at that point .
after that , i didn &apos;t know how to act around him ,
so ... we , uh , we never really talked again .
this must have been very disappointing
to the 16 @-@ year @-@ old adventuress
that you were at the time ,
but when you tell this story now ,
what does it make you think ?
that ben donovan was a pretty great guy .
hey . finally .
what do you need , ben ?
what &apos;s with the mood ? mom wear you out christmas shopping ?
no , we actually never made it to the mall .
dan and blair showed up in cornwall with damien dalgaard .
damien ? what &apos;s he doing with them ?
well , considering he &apos;s the one who sold me the pills
that i used on serena , i think i have a pretty good guess .
look , i told you the drugs were going too far .
never mind if they go to the cops .
what if those guys show up at mom &apos;s
and start asking questions ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure they already did .
and i &apos;m sure they &apos;re figuring it all out right now ,
which is exactly why i am gonna finish this thing
once and for all like i should have done in the first place .
where are you ? are you in the city ?
juliet ... you have done enough . do not go after serena .
if you touch her--
what ? it &apos;s not like you can stop me .
hey , i @-@ i need to make another call .
please , you &apos;ve got to let me make a call .
okay , fine , you make the call , but someone has to warn her .
serena van der woodsen .
hey , archibald ! i &apos;m ben . i &apos;m juliet &apos;s brother .
all right , you need to find serena and make sure she &apos;s okay .
wait , wait . what ? hey !
hey , man . you gotta back up from the bars , man .
you can &apos;t talk to him , okay ?
hey , man , what &apos;s up ?
hey , when &apos;s the last time you talked with serena ?
she &apos;s not answering her phone .
no , they took it away . it &apos;s part of her therapy .
oh , so she &apos;s still at the ostroff ?
that &apos;s good . i guess she &apos;s safe there .
what do you mean ? safe from what ?
i was visiting my dad ,
and i ran into juliet &apos;s brother ben ?
he was really upset , and he , uh , seemed to think
serena &apos;s in danger .
from--from who ? juliet ?
i don &apos;t know . he didn &apos;t get a chance to say .
but , uh , we should probably go check on her .
can you go ? i &apos;m in staten island .
no , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m with blair and damien in connecticut .
it &apos;s a long story , but ...
all right , meet us at the van der woodsens &apos; .
serena should be okay where she is ,
but we--we need to find juliet .
okay , i &apos;ll see you there .
uh @-@ oh , s.
you &apos;ve got a surprise visitor ,
and she &apos;s about to give you shock therapy .
look , i think i figured it out .
okay , serena had an affair with her teacher
because , let &apos;s face it . it &apos;s serena ,
and what else is there to do in connecticut ?
then she came to her senses and discarded him
like last season &apos;s chanel booties .
then he became a crazy stalker , and serena pressharges .
that should be a warning to you , humphrey .
yeah , because the parallels are striking .
never @-@ to @-@ be @-@ realized literary aspirations--check .
townie--you &apos;re from brooklyn , so check .
and giving up everything to become
serena van der woodsen &apos;s stalker--check .
face it , humphrey .
you are one knitted tie away from mr. donovan territory .
yeah , except for the fact that stalker implies one @-@ sided .
serena went to the saints and sinners ball
because she chose me .
yes , it was obvious this morning at the ostroff center
that serena couldn &apos;t wait to be in your arms .
and for the record , i haven &apos;t given anything up
to be with serena .
oh , of course not ... besides your time and your dignity .
you are chauffeuring me around , aren &apos;t you ?
and i &apos;m just curious .
when was the last time you wrote anything ?
and scribbling &quot; d. loves s . &quot;
all over your journal every night doesn &apos;t count .
and the photo of me on &quot; gossip girl &quot; --
that was you , too ?
yep . i went out dressed like you
and partied like it was 2007 .
and then you just left me for dead in a motel room--
why ? because of nate or colin ?
no , you stupid bitch ,
because you destroyed my brother &apos;s life .
who &apos;s your brother ?
ben donovan .
ben is your brother ?
wh @-@ what did i ever do to him ?
the official charge is statutory rape
and transporting a minor across state lines .
but nothing happened .
the girl signed an affidavit stating otherwise .
i can &apos;t believe serena would do this .
okay . so i prove my innocence in court .
it &apos;s her word against mine .
i have to advise against going to trial .
they have a witness that saw you at the bed and breakfast .
you left campus with an underage student
and drove across state lines .
to a library .
i know . it &apos;s a bitter pill , but the girl &apos;s family
doesn &apos;t want the story to get out either ,
so they pressured the d.a.
into offering a plea bargain .
they can do that ?
serena &apos;s from a powerful family .
and we &apos;re nobodies .
a plea bargain keeps the case out of the papers
and keeps your name off the national sex offenders list .
you can start over again .
after i serve time for a crime i didn &apos;t commit .
i &apos;m sorry , ben .
thanks to you ,
my brother &apos;s currently serving a 5 @-@ year sentence .
i swear , i never accused ben of any crime .
he was nothing but good to me .
i saw the affidavit .
i didn &apos;t sign anything .
then who did ?
lily !
the party &apos;s lovely .
thank you .
now tell me , honestly , how is serena doing ?
oh , she &apos;s fine . she just needed a breather ,
and if it were up to me ,
she would be at canyon ranch right now , but they were booked .
actually , my sister needs more than a hot stone massage
to get better , but she &apos;s on her way to a full recovery .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but that was what serena wanted , and you know it .
eric , somewhere between a marlins jersey
and the absolute truth lies the better part of decorum .
becoming an adult is about learning the distinction .
you &apos;re doing some very exciting things , i hear .
i appreciate that .
mom , hey .
oh , sweetheart , hi .
well , looks like lily heard the divorce is back on .
look , i messed up . the house dad rented--
it was this place in rhinebeck
you guys went on your first vacation .
he really did want to surprise you .
i &apos;m afraid it doesn &apos;t change anything .
but it &apos;s not his fault ,
and now he &apos;s gonna have to go to a halfway house .
i &apos;m sorry , nate . it was never gonna work .
we were all just fooling ourselves .
hi , anne !
the truth is , i need this more than i need your father .
minnie , hi .
how are you ? is that one of your designs ?
it is .
oh ! you look adorable .
thank you .
come . i need to catch up with you .
good evening . on behalf of bass industries ,
i &apos;d like to wish you all a very happy holiday .
i &apos;d also like to acknowledge my stepmother
and all the work she &apos;s done for the company .
serena , what is she doing here ?
it &apos;s okay . i asked juliet to come .
wait here . i &apos;m gonna go talk to my mom . okay .
when charles asked me to take over , i was overwhelmed .
serena will explain .
but he &apos;s family , and i &apos;ve tried to do what &apos;s best
for my family . it &apos;s the one thing that has always guided me .
serena ! what a lovely surprise .
everything okay ?
i need to talk to you .
okay . well , let &apos;s just take a few photos real quick . smile .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know , but i feel a little sick inside
and not just because i &apos;m looking at him .
what , have you come to recruit another virgin
to be your drug mule ?
i would say , &quot; why , are you available ? &quot;
but i &apos;m leaving . thanks for the ride into the city .
okay , that &apos;s enough . thanks for helping .
just one more .
i can &apos;t do this . hi . i &apos;m--i &apos;m serena .
i &apos;m lily &apos;s daughter . i wasn &apos;t gonna be able to make it tonight
because , um , i was actually at the ostroff center .
but if it were up to my mother ,
she &apos;d have you believe that i was at canyon ranch .
that &apos;s because having a daughter who &apos;s in a mental hospital
threatens her carefully protected image .
she wants you all to think that she &apos;s the perfect host
and mother and wife , but the truth is
she &apos;s a selfish liar who will destroy anyone
who stands in her way .
time to turn on the charm , lily ,
because your perfect party just turned into the perfect storm .
i apologize . i told serena she couldn &apos;t take
the company plane to belize for christmas break ,
and apparently , she took it harder than i realized .
go find out what &apos;s going on with your sister .
please , rufus , take the holiday to get things under control .
with the upcoming sale of bass industries ,
we don &apos;t need any more surprises .
lily said she told you .
of course . forgive me . um , it &apos;s been a dizzying few days .
look , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on ,
but serena brought juliet here tonight .
don &apos;t take one step closer to her .
how do you feel about prison food
and daily strip searches ?
b , it &apos;s okay . i talked to juliet .
she &apos;s not the problem anymore . it &apos;s my mom .
well , clearly , she &apos;s drugged serena again .
dan , write a list of everything
damien said that he sold to juliet , and , you ,
look at the list and tell us
which one of those drugs
causes you to repeatedly trust psychopaths .
and you call the police .
okay , nobody is calling the police .
i know everything that juliet did ,
and nothing excuses it ,
but the van der woodsens are not putting any more
of her family members behind bars .
juliet , i &apos;ll find a way to get ben out of prison ,
i promise .
you &apos;re free to go now .
what ? no ! no , this is unacceptable .
juliet has tried to hurt you too many times .
you can &apos;t just let her walk away .
blair &apos;s right , serena .
i promise i won &apos;t do anything to harm serena again ,
or anyone else for that matter .
yeah , that &apos;s reassuring .
i &apos;m sorry .
i just spent a day
in a ... car with dan humphrey to try to track her down ,
and you &apos;re just letting her leave .
i really need someone to tell me what &apos;s going on .
okay , look , i &apos;ll explain everything to everyone .
i just need to talk to my mom first .
i apologize , charles .
it seems that my biological children
don &apos;t understand that when business is at stake ,
you need to leave your dirty laundry in the hamper .
is that what ben donovan was to you--dirty laundry ?
who &apos;s ben donovan ?
he was my boarding school teacher .
mom falsely accused him of statutory rape ,
so now he &apos;s serving time for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
is that what the ostroff center calls treatment these days ?
public scenes and false accusations ?
juliet is ben &apos;s sister . she told me everything .
so , please , no more lying . what happened ?
you wanted to come home , and i wanted you here .
but when constance saw your records from knightley ,
they wouldn &apos;t take you back ,
and it was the same with all the decent schools .
and i @-@ i was worried about your future ,
so i went to knightley
and talked to the administration .
of course you did .
well , when i was on campus ,
there were some girls gossiping about you .
they said that you had spent the night
at a bed and breakfast with one of your teachers .
that was just gossip .
well , it was gossip i could use to our advantage .
i expressed my concern to the school
that one of their teachers was having
an inappropriate relationship with my underage daughter .
so you sent ben to prison
so that i could go to constance ?
well , no ! o @-@ of course not .
but after i left , the school ... alerted the authorities ,
and then i didn &apos;t know what i had set in motion
until i was contacted by the d.a. ,
and by then , it was too late .
what , too late to tell the truth ?
so you just destroy a man &apos;s life ,
all so that you can keep up appearances ?
no , i did this for you ,
for your future .
look , it &apos;s not like mr. donovan was guilt @-@ free .
he--he shouldn &apos;t have been having an affair with a student .
but he didn &apos;t do anything . nothing ever happened .
serena , you don &apos;t have to protect him .
i &apos;m not protecting him .
he never touched me , mom .
you sent an innocent man to prison .
look , everyone here has crossed the line at some point
to protect someone they care about .
sometimes ... there &apos;s collateral damage .
it &apos;s not so easy when you &apos;re the collateral damage .
maybe it &apos;s time to put everything on the table .
lily , do you have something you need to tell chuck ?
well , if there was something i wanted to tell charles ,
i would have told him .
lily &apos;s selling bass industries .
it &apos;s all very complicated . i had to talk to the board first .
i trusted you with my father &apos;s company .
i want it back ...
immediately .
do you really think the board would allow me to give
the company to someone who just disappeared for three months ?
your instability is the reason that i ended up in charge
in the first place .
i won &apos;t let you do this , lily .
serena , i &apos;m so sorry . please believe me .
you have to .
i don &apos;t have to do anything for you ever again .
i ...
i didn &apos;t wanna hurt anyone , rufus .
i really thought i was helping .
i &apos;m sorry , lily . i @-@ i don &apos;t know that i believe that anymore .
they say you reap what you sow .
better get out your gardening gloves , lily .
looks like you &apos;re going to have a bumper crop this year .
see , i told ya ,
food is more delicious when you cook it yourself .
yep , that &apos;s why we &apos;re gonna end this experiment
in middle class living and call housekeeping to clean up .
no way ! i stuck my hand up a turkey &apos;s butt .
you &apos;re not getting out of your job .
well , i provided the location , so i did my part .
now i &apos;m off to new zealand to enjoy a taste of summer
and girls who like sex games in the rain forest .
well , i &apos;ll help clear . it &apos;s only fitting ,
seeing as i did the shopping , set the table ,
and oversaw the cooking .
all right .
is that lily ?
by proxy . she &apos;s in montecito
so she &apos;s having cece call .
is rufus going to join her ?
yeah , but he &apos;s driving out on his own .
he kind of needs time to clear his head .
see ? i told you road trips are strictly for humphreys .
since my mom isn &apos;t going to help get ben out of jail ,
i wanna find the judge whose name is on the affidavit .
i think that he lives upstate , so i thought i &apos;d turn it
into a road trip . why don &apos;t you come with me ?
uh , how long were you thinking ?
well , i have to be back by the time school starts .
i called dean reuther and explained that
it wasn &apos;t me that dropped out . she was not happy ,
but she did reinstate me .
good @-@ bye , friends , dan .
i &apos;ll see you in the new year .
wait . i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll walk you out . here .
new zealand ?
that &apos;s awfully close to australia .
you know me . i like the heat .
well , you &apos;ll get plenty of it if you try to make a deal
with the devil . jack will never help you .
maybe , but a shared enemy makes for unlikely friends .
you ready ?
happy holidays , blair .
hey . i &apos;m sorry to just spring a road trip on you like that .
i didn &apos;t even ask what your plans for the break were .
oh , no , i don &apos;t really have any plans .
i was ... sort of hoping to hang out with you
and ... go see some movies , maybe get some writing done .
well , then why don &apos;t you come with me ?
you could still write . come on . it would be so much fun .
it would be just the two of us listening to the radio
and eating roadside food and do a little recon along the way .
what do you say ? i think it would be good for us .
but would it be good for you ?
serena , i would love to go away with you ,
but it feels like this trip
is something you might need to do on your own .
i &apos;ve been trying so hard to prove to the world
that i &apos;ve changed .
but i think the person that doubted the most was me .
i &apos;m gonna work on that .
and you &apos;ll succeed . i know you will .
i mean , i know you better than anyone .
be safe .
whenever we gave up something we really care about
we hope that the universe
will reward our selfless choice .
hey , dad , how &apos;s it going ?
i &apos;ve done some research
on my options for halfway houses ,
and some of them aren &apos;t too bad .
i mean , after prison ,
it &apos;s not like i need the four seasons .
what about the empire ?
what do you mean ?
well , i spoke with the parole board .
i gave them my address as
where you &apos;ll be reporting in january .
i want you to come back to a home .
thank you , nate .
i can &apos;t tell you how much this means to me .
well , i &apos;m out buying you some new clothes .
i know you &apos;ve been locked away for a while ,
but no one &apos;s wearing orange this season .
however , it &apos;s not always fate that gives us a gift .
sometimes it &apos;s someone closer to home .
what are you still doing here ?
shouldn &apos;t you be off living your dream--
days on end in a real car with serena ?
no , i &apos;m staying here , so actually ,
i &apos;ll be living out my nightmare ,
trapped in the city with only blair waldorf to talk to .
nate &apos;s here .
i &apos;ll share custody as long as i &apos;m in first position .
no , nate &apos;s with his grandfather .
eric , then .
gstaad with elliot . please don &apos;t continue down the list .
i promise you , it &apos;s just me . i won &apos;t be calling .
i &apos;m gonna be very busy writing ,
turning vanessa &apos;s room into an office ,
seeing &quot; ninette &quot; at the film forum .
i &apos;m seeing &quot; ninette &quot; at film forum .
you like french documentaries about orangutans ?
&quot; ninette &quot; is an inspiration .
last summer , i &apos;d go to the jardin des plantes
all the time just to visit her .
if we happen to run into each other ,
please don &apos;t sit next to me .
i wouldn &apos;t think of it .
let &apos;s just finish these dishes so we can go home , all right ?
i &apos;ll wash . you dry .
you wouldn &apos;t know how to handle redel .
this coming from the one holding what appears to be
a bottle of l &apos;occitane shampoo .
you can &apos;t wash good wine glasses in common dish soap .
just follow my lead , humphrey .
you &apos;re used to doing that .
could you please just tell me what &apos;s going on ?
my mom and sister are out of town ,
so i know they aren &apos;t visiting .
serena . what are you doing here ?
i had to come see you .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
neither do i.
but i feel like i should start .
if you love someone , set them free .
