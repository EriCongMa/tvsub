the gathering
yesterday while we were in florida ,
a body was found in the desert
outside las cruces , new mexico .
a man had his leg amputated
and replaced with the leg of someone else .
someone &apos;s out there mimicking the crimes we solved .
this is now an active case ,
which we &apos;ll be investigating along with our other cases .
hello . i &apos;m still here .
zug ... zwang .
it &apos;s a chess term .
it describes the point in the game
when a player realizes he &apos;ll inevitably be checkmated .
guess what just came to the reception desk
for an agent jennifer jareau .
zugzwang .
who sent it ?
they knew you would be at that phone booth ,
which means they were stalking you .
or us .
what if this is the replicator ?
the original zugzwang taunt was directed at me .
if it &apos;s directed at one of us ,
it &apos;s directed at all of us .
so far he &apos;s committed 3 murders in 3 different states .
if the replicator &apos;s still out there ,
then this whole thing is part of a much bigger manipulation .
first he was chasing us ,
and now it &apos;s our turn to chase him .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
how in the hell did he get so much access ?
yeah , thank you .
winslow , arizona , pd statewide system security check
reports no breaches .
they were the last .
if the replicator isn &apos;t hacking in ,
how is he learning details of these crimes .
maybe it &apos;s a journalist .
they &apos;re skilled at obtaining confidential information .
but why not help out his career in the process ?
the media didn &apos;t know
that adam rain was making human marionettes ,
but somehow the replicator did .
he &apos;s been watching us for months .
maybe we were the only source he needed .
that would require him to be in two places at the same time .
i &apos;ve assembled a pretty accurate timetable
of the unsub &apos;s stalking and murder activities ,
and based on the estimated time of death
regarding our amputated replication ,
the unsub wasn &apos;t stalking us during the investigation
of the whitewood @-@ turner crimes in miami
because he was dumping his victim in new mexico .
yet , he was still back in d.c. in time to see me
hit my game @-@ winning home run against the secret service .
baby girl , this the best you got ?
i &apos;m blowing it up as much as i can .
what about this ?
look at the reflection in blake &apos;s glasses .
it &apos;s grainy , but it looks like some creep taking pictures .
you know , we &apos;ve got all of this and the best we can tell
is this guy has a blue baseball cap .
i know and i &apos;m sorry .
i promise i will be home before you guys wake up .
well , the sooner we get this guy ,
the sooner the security detail can go away .
okay , we &apos;re trying .
i love you .
erin , what are you doing here so late ?
i had a meeting with the director .
i thought we were going to brief him in the morning .
you were . he canceled .
you have no fresh leads .
he wants the replicator classified inactive .
all due respect , ma &apos;am ,
but this guy &apos;s hardly inactive . he &apos;s planning his next move .
and when he makes that move , you &apos;ll be there to stop him .
how many times have you told me
that sometimes the best thing to do is wait ,
each crime teaches you something new ?
the replicator is dormant .
you &apos;re not learning anything new .
all you &apos;re doing is working yourselves to death
and ignoring the cases that need your attention .
erin , he &apos;s stalking this team .
no one &apos;s gonna give it up .
i know that . and neither will i.
but the cases are piling up and they need to be cleared
so the director no longer
thinks that his best unit is dropping the ball .
so , go home .
start fresh tomorrow .
i hate to admit it , but she &apos;s right .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s some psychopath out there
planning his next attack .
all right , go get some rest . back in here by 8 : 00 .
will , change of plans .
hey . hey , nikki .
nikki , come on .
where are you going ?
i can &apos;t do this anymore . it &apos;s never just one drink .
oh , come on .
i &apos;m tired of this .
all right . fine . just give me a second
to close up and we &apos;ll head home .
i &apos;m going home alone .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
this conversation is over .
let go of me !
i &apos;m not gonna lose you .
let her go , john .
who the hell are you ?
get off me .
you got two choices-- you can leave
or i can beat the hell out of you right now .
ok . ok !
you know what ? you &apos;re not worth it .
you want her so bad ,
you can have her .
walk away , john .
thank you .
you all right ?
i &apos;m fine . i just want to go home .
you shouldn &apos;t have to put up with that .
oh , he &apos;s not normally like this . he just ...
had too much to drink .
it &apos;s nice to finally meet you , nicole .
how do you know my name ?
what are you doing ?
stop it !
i almost knocked you--
sam ?
penelope .
what are you doing in my &apos; hood ?
3 @-@ day seminar .
i decided to skip the schmoozing over breakfast .
yeah , you never did have much patience for small talk .
do you need a hand ?
uh , sam , this is kevin .
we work together . kevin , this is sam .
we ... went on a couple of dates .
it was more than a couple dates .
nice to meet you .
so how are the ukulele lessons going ?
ukulele lessons ?
two months strong .
two months strong ?
you &apos;ll have to give me a concert sometime .
medium latte , light foam , extra soy .
that &apos;s you .
good memory .
listen , we should catch up .
we should .
perfect . nice to meet you , kenneth .
kevin .
did you know that soy milk
contains high levels of phytoestrogen ,
which mimics the functions of estrogen inside humans ?
i &apos;m just saying he &apos;s gonna have moobs .
what are moobs ?
man boobs .
go ahead , garcia .
yes , sir . ok .
so , over the past couple of days ,
two woman have been found murdered
with their tongues removed in st. paul , minnesota .
the first is patricia morris .
she was found at a local park by a couple of joggers .
and then a few hours ago nicole francis ,
she was found in a parking lot of a local restaurant .
both women died from multiple stab wounds .
had they been reported missing ?
no . in fact , local p.d. were the ones
who initially informed the families .
the m.o. is specific . anything on vicap ?
nothing yet , but i &apos;m still searching .
well , he definitely wasn &apos;t trying to hide the bodies .
they were left in very public places .
either he wanted them found quickly
or he &apos;s all about the act and not the clean @-@ up .
any witnesses ?
yeah , sort of . nicole was last seen at the restaurant
with her boyfriend john butler .
they had some sort of icky spat .
then he &apos;s on the short list .
no , he isn &apos;t . he actually has a solid alibi .
eh , liquid .
he was drinking at the bar all night .
right after he left , local p.d. picked him up
for public intoxication and they &apos;re holding him ,
but it &apos;s just until he sobers up .
ok , it takes a lot of strength to rip out someone &apos;s tongue .
it &apos;s one of the strongest muscles in the body .
the m.e. is still trying to determine
whether it was done ante- or postmortem .
according to chinese mythology ,
one of the most dreadful punishments in the 18 levels of hell
involves having one &apos;s tongue ripped out .
it &apos;s considered to be one of the most horrific forms of torture .
it &apos;s also symbolic , used to punish liars
and anti @-@ regime activists .
the very nature of the m.o. is overkill .
we can &apos;t rule out a personal vendetta .
these women may have had something on this unsub
and he wanted to make sure that they didn &apos;t live to talk about it .
wheels up in 30 .
laurel loves to play hard @-@ to @-@ get .
but i knew at night she &apos;d leave that one window open ...
just for me .
it was her special invitation to come and play ...
our very own game ...
of hide and seek .
she wanted me to find her .
and once i did ...
i was never going to let her go .
barbara grizzuti harrison once said ,
&quot; all acts performed in the world begin in the imagination . &quot;
the preliminary toxicology report
suggests neither woman was drugged .
no sign of a struggle or that he used restraints .
both women suffered solid blows to the head .
probably how he subdued them .
neither victim showed signs of sexual assault .
maybe he &apos;s impotent .
or sadistic .
the stabbing could be what &apos;s getting him off .
i have looked into both of the victims .
the only thing they have in common are the same zip code .
they have different occupations , interests , hobbies .
patricia was a pilates instructor ,
and nicole was a legal assistant .
both were low risk .
he could just be picking them at random .
if his primary motive is to kill ,
it explains why he didn &apos;t take either of his victims
to a secondary location .
but what take such a huge risk ?
both crime scenes have tons of foot traffic .
someone could have interrupted him .
oh , boy . local p.d. just discovered two bodies .
laurel tyson , 25 , and her brother daryl , 28 .
they were both stabbed to death inside her house .
attacking in the home hasn &apos;t been his m.o.
up to now they &apos;ve all been very public places .
two attacks on 3 victims in one night .
this is the first time he &apos;s killed a male .
is this turning into a spree ?
garcia , were their tongues missing ?
uh , laurel &apos;s was . daryl &apos;s was still intact .
if this is a spree ,
why is he taking time to collect souvenirs ?
garcia , expand your vicap search nationwide .
the ritual of the tongue extraction
seems to be what matters most to him .
detective boseman . thanks for coming out .
thanks for having us .
i &apos;m dr. reid . this is agent morgan .
nice to meet you . according to neighbors ,
somebody noticed an open window early this morning
and alerted authorities .
nothing violates one &apos;s sense of security
more than being attacked in their own home .
why didn &apos;t the alarm trigger when the window was opened ?
that &apos;s a good question .
maybe he knew what he was doing .
excuse me .
hey , give it to me good , baby girl .
unfortunately , all i have are daily coffee receipts
and weekly thai orders .
laurel didn &apos;t get out much .
she worked from home as a telemarketer ,
spent a lot of time surfing the web .
her most recent splurge
was a last @-@ minute plane ticket for her brother .
garcia , when did laurel have the alarm installed ?
two weeks ago .
she lived here 3 years
and didn &apos;t feel the urge to install an alarm until now .
thanks , mama .
maybe she flew him out here because she was scared .
having her brother around would make her feel more protected .
and if laurel was the target ,
then daryl &apos;s presence would have come as a surprise to the unsub .
making him a victim of circumstance .
the question is , how did he learn about 3 separate women
that lived 3 completely different lives ?
your report mentioned
you found rust fragments in the victims &apos; stomachs .
have you been able to determine if they were from the knife ?
either that or from the other object .
other object ?
the assailant used two weapons ,
one to grip and the knife to severe the tongue .
something like pliers .
well , that &apos;s new , isn &apos;t it ?
she was the only one with this type of bruising .
i &apos;m still doing tissue samples .
all 3 women had copious amounts of blood
in both their lungs and their stomachs .
they were still alive when their tongues were cut out .
i &apos;m really sorry about nicole .
can you tell me what you remember from last night ?
nicole got a raise a few days ago .
so i wanted to take her out to celebrate .
we started drinking ,
me more than her .
sometimes people overdrink in an attempt to mask their pain .
were you and nicole having relationship problems ?
we hadn &apos;t been on the same page for a while .
she &apos;d just gotten a great promotion
and i was laid off a few months back .
is that why the two of you decided to move in together last month ?
in theory it was a perfect idea .
till the issue of money came up .
was that how the argument started last night ?
she complained about how much i was drinking .
she stormed out of the restaurant .
hey , nikki .
i followed her into the parking lot .
nikki , come on .
and the next thing i know ,
some guy is slamming me into the car .
get off me !
do you think you could describe him ?
did you see his face ?
i was drunk . i wasn &apos;t thinking straight .
it &apos;s my fault .
i never should have left her out there .
you want her so bad , you can have her .
i figured he was someone she knew .
why would you think that ?
walk away . john .
because he knew my name .
go ahead , garcia .
sir , i did premium spelunking on these 3 women
and they were super duper active online ,
i mean chat rooms , blog ,
twitter , pinterest , facebook , you name it .
that could be how the unsub knew about john butler .
patricia was on multiple dating sites .
and laurel ?
oh , laurel . she had a blog
that makes &quot; 50 shades of grey &quot; read like a children &apos;s book .
it sounds like that &apos;s how he knew these women .
thanks , garcia .
is that work @-@ related or personal ?
hello !
peter , i asked you a question .
is that personal or work @-@ related ?
is everything all right ?
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
are you coming to the staff potluck tomorrow ?
yeah , i &apos;ll be there .
sure you &apos;re ok ?
fine .
anything ?
well , these women practically lived online .
their posts went up 5 , 6 times an hour .
&quot; brian used his own toilet for the first time today . &quot;
all right , cut her some slack .
she &apos;s excited . her son is potty @-@ trained .
brian is her cocker spaniel .
check this out .
on 1 : 14 , nicole posted a status update
saying she &apos;s waiting for somebody to rescue her
from a loveless relationship .
i assume she &apos;s referring to her and john .
on 1 : 08 , patricia tweeted ,
quote , &quot; saw one of the most beautiful oak trees in the park
i wish i could just take a nap under it
like i did when i was a little girl . &quot; end quote .
on 2 : 18 , laurel posted on her personal blog
about how much she likes pain .
she describes it as , &quot; the best foreplay . &quot;
then on 2 @-@ 21 , again laurel posts ,
talking about a fantasy where someone climbs through the window
and ravishes her with bondage .
that &apos;s exactly how the unsub entered her house--
through the living room window .
laurel was the only one with ligature marks .
he knew she was into s &amp; m .
technically , the unsub &apos;s the one that rescued nicole
from the argument she was having with her boyfriend .
he was the one that whisked her away .
and the first victim , patricia ,
was found in a local park under a tree .
so these women unknowingly described their own murders .
this guy targeted these women through their online activity ?
in the unsub &apos;s mind , their posts created a connection to him ,
which led to the initial stalking .
that tells us he &apos;s most likely socially awkward .
and his online surveillance
allowed him to build confidence over time .
it &apos;s likely these women don &apos;t know what the unsub looks like ,
making it possible for him to interact with them
without revealing his true identity .
what his victims considered pure fantasy ,
the unsub interpreted as literal and open invitation .
that compulsion is specific to his psychopathology .
if he &apos;s getting these readings on the web ,
his next inspiration could come from anywhere .
kayla ignored me , pretended like i wasn &apos;t even there .
time after time she &apos;d walk by me ...
never acknowledging my presence .
did she even know i existed ?
she was going to learn tonight .
no matter what ,
she was finally going to see me .
aah ! no !
and i wanted to make sure
that my face ...
was the last one ...
she &apos;d ever see .
the victim was kayla jefferson , 19,
local college student .
she lives on the third floor .
a neighbor discovered her body .
his ritual remained the same ,
even though his m.o. changed from stabbing to strangulation .
we &apos;ll have garcia check her internet history .
well , why didn &apos;t he kill her the same way he killed the others ?
he must have been inspired by a new fantasy .
we &apos;re ready to deliver the profile .
we &apos;re looking for fit , aggressive caucasian male
in his mid @-@ to late 30s .
he &apos;s practicing what &apos;s called vicarious fantasy assimilation .
this refers to the cathartic release that comes
when he turns someone else &apos;s thoughts or fantasies into reality .
he trolls the internet
and is selecting women with a strong online presence
and who frequently post their fantasies with descriptive detail .
there are two levels to his m.o. ,
the first being the enjoyment he gets
from taking one of his victim &apos;s fantasies
and turning it into a nightmare .
once he establishes his dominance by subverting that fantasy ,
then he moves on to step two ,
which is removing the tongue .
his m.o. is polymorphic .
it &apos;s taken on different forms .
however , his ritual never changes .
oh , i am so sorry .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s likely that there are other women he &apos;s already targeted ,
so be vigilant if there are any reports of suspicious behavior .
thank you .
this is alicia danner reporting live to you
from outside of the 13th street apartment building ,
where the body of a local college student
has just been identified as kayla jefferson .
police are also releasing
the names and photos of the other 4 victims ...
no , no , no .
who were brutally murdered
during the recent strain of attacks .
the fbi is asking anyone with information about this case
to contact the taskforce hotline shown on your screen .
patricia , nicole , laurel--
those are my girls . these are my stories .
my stories .
so , sam--
he seemed like a nice guy .
yeah . he--he is .
ricky d. he was a nice guy , too .
who &apos;s ricky d. ?
my college roommate .
drank coffee from sunup to sundown .
spent 4 years with the guy ,
and i never once remembered how he took his coffee .
you lost me at ricky .
i thought you said you guys just went on a couple dates .
that &apos;s what this is about ,
that i know what sam puts in his coffee ?
might i remind you that whose coffee order i memorize
is no longer any of your business .
i--i just thought--
you and i will finish this later .
so kayla was not at all into modern technology .
i mean , she didn &apos;t even own a computer ,
so that means there &apos;s no facebook ,
no twitter , no blogs , no nothing .
she never even activated her college email account .
well , if she doesn &apos;t fit his pattern , how do you know about her ?
good question , chocolate thunder .
i did a search on kayla &apos;s name
and it turns out she had a scary admirer .
what do you mean ?
i mean that a 16 @-@ year @-@ old boy named tyler rogers
dedicated a blog to her .
he had a lot of interesting things to say on it .
he lived in the same apartment building as kayla .
lived ?
yeah . he was institutionalized early january
for attacking his mother .
that can &apos;t be our guy . he &apos;s been locked up for months .
but we should still talk to him .
he might be able to give us something .
let &apos;s get reid on it .
thanks , garcia .
&quot; my fingers tightened around her throat .
i could feel her heartbeat pulsing under my fingertips . &quot;
when did you write this ?
sunday , december 15 , 2012 , 4 : 14 p.m.
did kayla do something to upset you ?
she ignored me . again .
and that made you want to kill her ?
you &apos;re funny .
your move .
tyler , kayla is dead .
someone took one of the stories you wrote
and made it real .
was there a lot of blood ?
your blog went into great detail about how you wanted to kill her .
now , i need to know , did you discuss this with anyone ?
with people on story swap , yeah .
作者 血腥本
so story swap allows you to download stories from other people .
are they all about murder ?
most of them .
but , you know , there was something for everyone .
rape and torture ...
thanks for your help .
do you have any pictures
of , uh , kayla &apos;s body ?
just wondered . i just want to see what he did to her .
unfortunately , tyler &apos;s still struggling ,
but a number of clinical studies have proven
that a person experiences the same neurochemical release
from the simple act of documenting a fantasy or a violent act .
no offense , dr. houston ,
but isn &apos;t this therapy intended to help traumatized victims ,
not perpetrators ?
while writing therapy as applied to offenders
may be somewhat controversial ,
it &apos;s proven to be very effective if done properly .
what do you mean by properly ?
well , i believe there are two phases to this type of treatment .
having the patient document the fantasy ,
then having them acknowledge the shame and the guilt .
if this treatment is so important to you ,
why did you take your name off it ?
i cut ties when i learned many of the facilities
weren &apos;t implementing the second phase .
what were they doing instead ?
they were allowing the patients to focus more on their fantasies
without discussing the root of the problem .
was tyler able to give you anything ?
so it turns out he was part of an online community
that exchanged psychopathic stories while remaining anonymous .
it &apos;s probably where the unsub learned about kayla ,
from tyler &apos;s posts .
which explains the switch in m.o.
tyler was fixated on strangulation .
so , where &apos;s the unsub gonna get his material for his next kill ?
all the victims used different platforms .
writing seems to be the only common denominator .
guys , what if he created his own writing group ?
dr. houston &apos;s spoken all over the country .
he could have attended a conference
or read about his form of therapy .
and adapted it to fit his needs .
instead of working the steps , he &apos;s focused on one thing--
acting out homicidal stories .
and a vivid description of the blood ,
how it felt .
i can tell you dug deep for this one .
thank you , tina .
i believe we have time for one more story .
i &apos;ve got one .
the title of this one is &quot; betrayed . &quot;
&quot; i never knew someone i trusted
&quot; would hurt me so deeply .
&quot; tonight i &apos;m going to make him pay
for stealing what i valued most . &quot;
keep reading .
you haven &apos;t gotten to the best part .
what i don &apos;t understand is
why this guy is removing all the tongues .
well , the tongues symbolize the telling of tales .
in his mind they &apos;re trophies .
and by taking them ,
he was able to claim possession of stories that weren &apos;t his own .
it &apos;s like the others in the group aren &apos;t aware of what he &apos;s doing .
but with the specificity of these crimes ,
it &apos;s only a matter of time before people put the pieces together .
thank you very much .
good night , guys . see you next week .
so what &apos;d you think ?
we &apos;re getting a lot of calls ,
but so far none of the leads are panning out .
go ahead , baby girl . talk to me .
i got a hit on vicap .
3 , one @-@ offs , actually .
tampa , atlanta , charlotte .
3 women in the last two years who &apos;ve all had their--
it never gets less disgusting to say--tongues removed .
so this isn &apos;t the first time he &apos;s done this .
this is not his first creepy rodeo .
nope , according to my digging ,
one of the first talks that dr. houston gave
was at an anonymous call center in tampa
where a gentleman named mark jackson was working ,
who mysteriously went awol a few days later .
shortly thereafter , tongueless bodies start showing up .
guess where he lives now .
st. paul . got a local address ?
uh @-@ huh , of course i do .
i have home and a place
where he teaches a writing group every wednesday .
thank you , mama .
why did you stop ? come on , i want feedback .
i &apos;ll have notes next week , peter .
oh , come on , mark . now is not the time to be shy .
i &apos;d rather not .
what is it you &apos;d like to say ? speak and be heard .
so please continue .
is something wrong ?
you plagiarized my work .
that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong .
for 3 months i confided in you .
i told you everything .
listen to me .
you told me that if i wrote about my fantasies ,
they would go away .
instead you just took them from me .
i said that it would help suppress--
no . no . all you really wanted was to take
what was in my head for yourself .
excuse me ?
let &apos;s get one thing straight .
you are weak .
what i did , you could never do yourself .
was she going to be next ?
who ?
tammy .
was she next ?
answer me .
i can &apos;t let you have her .
that one &apos;s special .
she was gonna meet with me , you know .
peter ...
she makes me feel normal .
we have a real connection .
and now you want to take her away from me ?
you should be honored
that i chose your stories .
i did everything that you described ,
down to the smallest detail .
oh , i see .
and that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
what are you talking about ?
there &apos;s one detail you got wrong .
i never cared about the tongue .
that was you .
clear !
clear !
he &apos;s not here .
it &apos;s mark jackson . it &apos;s definitely our guy ,
but somebody got to him before we could .
hotch , we never profiled a second unsub .
well , we didn &apos;t have one until now .
well , we got guys canvassing the area for witnesses ,
but whoever did this to mark didn &apos;t hold back .
thanks .
that had to be personal .
no one walks around carrying that type of rage .
this kill doesn &apos;t show the same level of confidence
that mark showed with his previous victims .
mark could be his first kill .
it most likely won &apos;t be his last .
thanks , garcia .
well , she figured out what made mark tick .
when he was 10 , he confessed to his mother
that her boyfriend had been abusing him .
let me guess . when child protective services arrived ,
she changed her story .
told them mark had made the whole thing up .
it explains the tongues . he viewed all women as liars .
it looks like he documented every attack .
the semantics in these two writings are markedly different .
they were all composed by different authors .
危机热线
call first . to whom am i speaking with this evening ?
my name is peter .
hi , peter . how can i help you ?
i &apos;m not sure where to start .
start wherever is most comfortable .
i feel i &apos;m at a crossroads .
the point in my life where ...
i &apos;m faced with some tough decisions .
the kind that once you commit , you can never go back .
making a choice can be stressful for anyone .
i just ...
need something to point me in the right direction .
i understand .
we all experience moments where we need clarity in life .
it &apos;s important you understand
it &apos;s something that everyone goes through .
hello ? hello . peter ?
peter : 我刚刚还想起你来着
let me get this straight .
mark encouraged his group members to go after these women ?
not exactly . he wanted them to document
their violent thoughts and emotions down to the last detail .
and he used those as blueprints for his kills .
we think our new unsub was in the group .
when he discovered what mark had done , he unraveled .
and now that he &apos;s given in to his urges ,
he may want to kill again .
&quot; pat in the park . &quot;
&quot; nicole &apos;s knight . &quot;
&quot; laurel &apos;s open window . &quot;
sound familiar ?
those were the first 3 victims .
they were all written by someone named peter .
his most recent story is about saving a woman named tammy
from drowning in a lake .
it &apos;s 30 degrees outside . they &apos;d freeze to death .
sir , yes , sir .
garcia , what &apos;s the name of the organization where mark volunteered ?
call first .
all right . check their phone records for the days mark worked ,
for any calls that came in from someone named peter .
ok , this is a crazy popular hotline .
they get a ton of calls , like a half a dozen peters .
any of them call multiple times ?
let me see ...
here &apos;s one @-@ peter harper .
it looks like mark initially took the call .
and the last time peter called the hotline was ...
less than an hour ago .
where would peter harper be now ?
rosewood , just outside of st. paul .
yeah , that &apos;s gotta be him .
but where is he taking tammy ?
it looks like she &apos;s a swimmer .
water is crucial to peter &apos;s fantasy .
hey , there &apos;s a community center nearby .
i &apos;m sending you the digits right now .
thanks , garcia .
somebody help !
please ?
hello ? is someone there ?
who are you ?
what am i doing here ?
god , you &apos;re even more beautiful up close .
don &apos;t touch me .
who are you ?
it &apos;s me , peter .
oh , my god .
why are you doing this ?
i need your help with something
i &apos;ve been struggling with for a while now .
what is it ?
i need you to convince me not to kill you .
please tell me why you &apos;re doing this .
i had to protect you from him .
what ? who ?
it doesn &apos;t matter anymore . he &apos;s gone now .
don &apos;t cry .
do you know how long i &apos;ve waited for this moment ?
i wrote something for you .
&quot; if she only knew how special she was ,
&quot; how she made me feel human for the first time .
&quot; but ...
&quot; if she knew about the secret thoughts i had ,
would she stay ? &quot;
what do you think ?
you need help .
peter , i can be there for you .
i know the moment i untie you , you &apos;ll leave .
i already lost someone today .
i can &apos;t lose you , too .
you have my word .
god , i wish i believed you .
no , no , no .
i couldn &apos;t have written this any better .
peter harper , fbi ! don &apos;t move !
drop the knife , peter !
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m going in .
mark is a liar and a thief
and i made him pay .
peter , i know he betrayed your trust .
just put the knife down and we can talk about this .
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like--
the thoughts and the images that won &apos;t go away .
this is my only option .
peter , that &apos;s not true .
listen , i know exactly
what it &apos;s like .
right now is the part where i &apos;m supposed to lie to you ,
tell you that everything &apos;s gonna be ok
and that we can somehow help you ,
but the fact of the matter is , peter , i don &apos;t know if we can .
there might not be any form of therapy
that ever takes these urges away .
spence , what are you doing ?
but that doesn &apos;t mean you stop trying .
peter , no matter what happens , you have to keep trying .
i know it &apos;s not what you want to hear ,
but at least it &apos;s the truth .
i appreciate your honesty .
oscar wilde said ,
&quot; i can resist anything except temptation . &quot;
reid .
i just finished the case file .
i talked to morgan and jj and
i wanted to talk to you about what happened .
the hostage was clear and i made a tactical decision
to tell the unsub the truth about his condition .
and what did you think that would accomplish ?
well , hotch , i thought the last time i was in a situation like this ,
i did exactly what i was supposed to .
i told a perfect lie and that didn &apos;t work ,
so this time , in the hopes of saving someone &apos;s life ,
i tried something different .
and this didn &apos;t work .
sadly , no .
to me , this is very clearly about maeve .
i just wanted to apologize for the way i acted earlier .
no . no , no , no . please , please don &apos;t apologize .
that was all me . i was being really snappy .
i just--
well , i never knew you were taking ukulele lessons .
yeah . it &apos;s number 32 on my
i don &apos;t want to call it a bucket list bucket list .
you know , i never thought we &apos;d be here .
well , when you break up with someone , there &apos;s that fantasy
that you can stay friends , which i guess is a fantasy .
penelope , i want to be friends .
so do i. but can you handle it ?
because friends support each other and their relationships ,
and so far i have see you now date gina , lisa ,
mindy , leslie , shannon , gina again .
i get it .
i mean-- it &apos;s not easy for me ,
but i want you to be happy .
same here .
ok . ok , i gotta go .
by the way ,
gina really liked the bracelet you helped me pick out .
well , i do know jewelry .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
bright and early .
i don &apos;t know how much longer i can contain the crowd .
thank you .
penelope , penelope ...
