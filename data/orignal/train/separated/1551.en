加州 旧金山
we've just received a report
that the victim has been identified
by the San Francisco locals as Natalie gibecki,
although police are keeping the nature of her death
under wraps for the moment.
Her name's Natalie Gibecki. 27 years old.
Works as a counselor
in a youth probation facility a few blocks over.
The mayor serves on the board, so we got the call.
Petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes
and the marks around the neck indicate that she was strangled.
Where's Lisbon?
She's with S.F.P.D.
They talked to the victim's boss.
Apparently, she was on her way
to see a movie with friends.
Not likely.
Come again?
Well, she's wearing a black lace camisole.
She was planning on changing her flats to heels.
Her makeup is freshly applied.
She's wearing a very... very flowery perfume--
J'adore, if I'm not mistaken.
She was going to meet a lover.
Married, I'd guess, based on the deception.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Hello, Patrick. It's Erica Flynn.
Erica Flynn. Wow, this is a surprise.
Pleasant, I hope.
I bet you're wondering why I'm calling.
Yeah. Thought crossed my mind.
What if I said I wanted to hear your voice?
I'd say you were lying.
Not entirely.
Natalie Gibecki-- I knew her personally.
She was a client of my matchmaking company.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
We grew very close during our sessions together,
but then you know how that can happen.
What do you want, Erica?
Yes, I haven't said, have I?
No.
I'm calling because I can help you find her killer.
Really? What's his name?
If you want the answer, you know where to find me.
It was nice to hear your voice again, Patrick.
Yours, too.
Thank you, Dennis.
Of course, Ms. Flynn.
You're helpful as always.
Who was that?
Uh, that was Erica Flynn.
She wants to help out with the investigation.
Great. We should fax over the case file
and get her a gun.
Well, getting her a gun's a bit much,
but, uh, I think the case file may help.
I was kidding.
yeah.
you're kidding, right?
Please tell me you're kidding.

Hello, Patrick.
Erica. You look good.
Orange suits you.
Well, I suppose I have you to thank for my wardrobe.
I didn't kill your husband.
Neither did I. Manslaughter. Big difference.
What is this about?
I know who killed Natalie Gibecki.
How is that possible?
We grew close during our sessions together.
Natalie told me things that she didn't tell anyone else,
like the fact that she was seeing someone in secret.
Why would she need a dating service
if she was already seeing someone?
She met him during our sessions together.
That must have been some time ago.
Ten months,
But Natalie was still seeing him when she died.
I'm sure of it.
How?
I know true love when I see it.
Then why the secrecy?
The man Natalie was seeing was married.
She kept the affair from everyone.
Everyone except you.
Yes.
Why are you doing this?
I cared deeply about Natalie.
Her death is a tragedy,
and her killer should be punished.
That was a nice try.
All right. I want out of here.
Temporarily, of course.
You have no idea what this is like, Patrick,
Living in a cage,
knowing I'll be here for years.
The truth is, this may be my last chance at freedom
while I'm young enough to enjoy it.
I just want to go to the spa,
eat at my favorite restaurant,
a few harmless indulgences
in return for helping you catch a killer.
What if you're lying?
You once said you could see right through me.
"Transparent as glass," I believe, was how you put it,
So tell me, am I lying now?
Natalie Gibecki left the youth facility at 8:14 P.M.
A commuter found her body at 8:33,
giving us a 19-minute window
for the murder to have been committed.
And what do we have for motive?
Well, there's nothing missing from Natalie's body,
So robbery seems out.
No sign of sexual assault, either.
Natalie had just returned
from a 5-day trip to Puerto Vallarta.
I'm checking it out.
What about Jane's theory about a boyfriend?
We looked into it.
Friends all say Natalie wasn't seeing anyone.
Family?
Only child. Parents died years ago.
All right. Head to the youth facility
and talk to the other counselors
that were working on Natalie's shifts.
See if they know anything.
Uh, boss, any way I can skip this and work the phones?
I have an appointment in an hour I can't miss.
Are you all right?
Yeah, everything's fine.
It's just, uh, something I have to do.
Sure. Van Pelt?
Sure. On it.
We're from CBI.
We're here investigating Natalie Gibecki's murder.
I don't know how we're gonna tell the boys.
They all loved Natalie.
Do you guys have any idea who did this?
We're still in the early stages of the investigation.
We have reason to believe that Natalie may have been
romantically involved with someone.
Either of you know anything about that?
No.
Yeah, no. I thought she was single.
Hey, Kevin!
Keep that up.
You'll be doing push-ups until you puke.
The relationship could have been with a co-worker.
Well, don't look at me.
You didn't like her?
No, I didn't say that. She--
She just wasn't my type.
Kevin! What did I just say?
Now drop and give me 50. Now!
Can you think of anyone who may have wanted to harm Natalie?
No, but... we did have a kid go missing
from the facility last night.
Hey, trent didn't have anything to do with this.
His name was trent?
Trent Matthews. He's 17.
Was in here for drug possession and assault.
What time did he go missing?
I saw him at dinner, so sometime after 7:00.
Yeah, but like I said, he didn't have anything to do with this.
We're gonna need to see his file.
Keep going.
You want to let her out of prison?
Well, no, I just think Erica could help us.
She knows details of the victim's life.
She may even know the killer.
She says she does.
That she's telling the truth about.
Even so, it doesn't mean we need her help.
No, I didn't say that. I said she could be useful.
What do you think, luther?
I'm intrigued.
Sir.
I think...
it's just the kind of innovative thinking
the CBI needs more of.
Using a convict to catch a killer--
it's synergy.
Exactly.
Sir, this isn't even our jurisdiction.
We couldn't get her released if we tried.
You're right,
but the warden at golden valley state prison
has already approved it.
Ms. Flynn's guaranteed a furlough through
the rehabilitation program that the governor instituted.
Apparently, she's a model inmate.
She's a convicted murderer.
Convicted manslaughterer, actually.
Oh, well, in that case...
So you agree?
No. She's a dangerous killer,
and she's a flight risk.
Well, which is exactly why I'll be assigning two agents
to guard her at all times.
See, Lisbon? What could possibly go wrong?
Excuse me.
Synergy.
hey, Cho.
What's up?
You called me.
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's right.
I got some background on trent matthews.
He was attending Sequoia Valley high school
before he was busted for possession and assault.
It's not that far from the youth facility.
You think he might head back there?
Well, he's alone.
Family moved away from the area.
He's probably just looking for some cash and a place to stay.
Might try old friends for help.
All right. Van Pelt and I will get on it.
Wayne, you ready? Class is about to start.
Oh, yeah, yeah. All set.
Welcome, mommies and daddies.
My name is Atoosa,
and I will be leading your class today.
Welcome to the first step
on your amazing journey of parenthood.
Now before we begin, I would like each of you
to go around the room and offer something about yourselves.
Would you like to start?
Sure. Um, hi. My name is Sarah.
Welcome, sarah.
Oh, hi. I'm Wayne.
Welcome, Wayne.
Um... Okay, I'm 28 weeks.
Uh, this is my first child.
Wait. Our first child?
Oh, yeah. Definitely our first.
Okay. Our first child.
Well, although "Our" might be a little misleading.
No, not that this isn't his baby.
I am not some kind of floozy or anything,
And, gosh, not that anyone in this room is, uh, you know--
No, I--that is-- I just meant, um--
She just meant that we're not married.
That--that was it, that we're not married.
No. I mean, yes.
According to the youth facility,
Trent Matthews was busted for possession
At this high school three months ago.
You know, kids used to call me "Bracey Gracie"
Because I wore braces until I was 17.
What did people call you?
Cho.
That's him.
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Hey, break it up!
Come on! Get off me, man!
Hey, get off, man.
Trent matthews?
What?
CBI. We need a word.
Screw your word, man.
You needn't look so glum, lisbon.
If anything happens, you're not gonna be held responsible.
Because that's what I'm worried about.
You know why she's doing this.
To try and escape, most likely.
Yet you're going through with it anyway.
Are you doing this
because you need Erica's help
or because you want it?
Agents, you can come in now.
You'll have to sign for custody.
Thank you.
Hello, Patrick.
Erica.
Inmate Erica Marie Flynn is now in your custody.
Take good care of her.
Thanks.
All right. Who is he?
Who?
Natalie's killer. Don't be cute.
Oh, I don't know his name.
It's all in my symphony files.
Did I not make that clear?
No, you didn't.
Must have slipped her mind.
Where are the files?
My lawyer is having them sent to your offices now.
Good. Let's get this over with.
You got her?
We got her.
Ms. Flynn, I'm agent Mcclay.
This is agent Morris.
We'll be supervising you during your furlough.
I hope you don't mind.
A friend of mine owns a car company...
And has offered me transportation while I'm out.
How thoughtful.
Patrick, are you coming?
Okay.
This should be fun.
Here's your tea.
Thanks so much. Oh, Ron?
Yes, Ms. Flynn.
Would you mind getting me some lemon for that?
Of course.
Hey, boss.
I checked out that trip Natalie took to Puerto Vallarta.
It seems she traveled alone.
She meet anybody there?
I'm not sure.
We've been unable to locate her camera,
but Natalie did upload travel photos on to a web site,
so I'm having those printed out now.
Okay.
What is it with this woman?
Uh, she can get men to do whatever she wants,
and I can't for the life of me figure out why.
Really?
I get it. I mean, if I were a guy.
Assault is a serious offense, Trent.
Man, that dude was a snitch.
Is that why you were smashing his face in?
Hell, yeah. He's the reason why
I got sent to juvie in the first frickin' place.
So you ran away from the youth facility
to get revenge?
No, man. I left 'cause I had to.
I wasn't about to get jacked up.
You had a beef with one of the other kids?
Just one of my counselors-- big dude named Danny.
Danny Vargas?
Yeah.
What happened?
I mean, well, the night I took off, he, uh...
He and Natalie were fighting.
I mean, like, for real, you know?
Um, she-- she was yelling at him like crazy, man,
all up in his face,
But, uh, see, Danny--
Uh, he's real hard with us kids.
He, uh, I mean, he pushes us,
smacks us around when no one's lookin'...
Except this time Natalie saw it go down.
She wasn't too happy about it, you know?
I mean, the girl...
Girl just started flippin' out on him.
Did things get physical between them?
Oh, well, it was about to, until I stepped in.
I mean... I mean, y-you can't lay your hands on a woman.
I don't--I don't give a damn who you are.
But, anyway, I mean, Danny got mad, real mad,
so I took off before he could do something about it.
You think danny would have hurt you in retaliation?
I know he would have.
The dude has frickin' issues, man.
He--he should be the one sitting here, not me.
Listen, with all bull aside,
let me tell you something, all right?
I would never hurt Natalie, ever.
I-I got no reason to.
I mean, she--she was one of the only adults
who ever treated me like a person, you know?
Yeah, I do.
Hey. You okay?
Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Uh, no. That video was...
Oh, god. It was horrible.
I had no idea that childbirth could be so...
Well, so scary.
Oh, it wasn't that bad.
Sarah, I'm a homicide detective.
I've seen some pretty graphic things,
But that, uh, nothing prepared me for that.
How do you think I feel? I have to go through it.
Wayne, you're gonna be okay with this, right?
Yeah, I think so.
I-I mean, yes. Y-yes.
All right. Good. Because I...
I can't do this on my own.
I know.
What are you looking for in a man?
Well, someone generous...
And caring.
Someone who puts the needs of others before themselves.
I want a man I can grow old with,
A best friend.
Problem?
This is so frustrating.
One of Natalie's interviews is missing.
How unfortunate.
I know what you're thinking, but I had nothing to do with it.
It's not my problem if your people misplace things.
"My people"?
All right. That's enough. Let's go.
Where?
Back to prison.
You shouldn't be out if you can't actually help ith the investigation.
Well, just hang on a second.
Just 'cause there's a video missing,
doesn't mean she can't help find Natalie's lover, right?
Absolutely. It's all right here.
Natalie lived for her work.
She dedicated her life to helping others.
The fact that she found love without my service
can only mean one thing--
The man she was seeing was a co-worker.
I tried that. No luck.
That's because she wasn't working at the youth facility
when she met him.
This was ten months ago, remember?
Mm. You mean when she was working
at the nonprofit, Casa Encantar?
Exactly.
Shall we?
We shall.
Welcome to Casa Encantar. Can I help you?
Yes. My fiance and I are looking
for a nonprofit to volunteer for.
Let me show you around.
We're not usually this busy, but we're throwing
a fund-raising event tomorrow night.
It's actually a release party
for a book that our C.E.O. has written.
Here he is now.
Hi. I'm Greg Relin. Welcome.
It's wonderful, what you do here.
Thank you. Since we started, we've been lucky enough
to build six schools, four clinics, two orphanages,
throughout Mexico, all in small rural villages,
some without electricity or running water.
That's our newest orphanage.
We hope to have four more just like it
by the end of the year.
If we raise enough support tomorrow night.
So Evan's told you about our gala?
There will be plenty of food and drink,
even some entertainment.
You're both welcome to come.
See--see what a difference you can make.
Wow. Thank you very much for the invitation.
Tell me, when did you last see Natalie Gibecki?
I'm sorry?
Don't be.
You said you were looking to volunteer.
No, I didn't. She did,
and she also said I was her fiance. Cheeky.
And you are who, exactly?
I'm Patrick Jane. I'm a consultant with the CBI.
I'm investigating Natalie's murder.
She was seeing someone here, yes?
Not that I know of. Evan?
No.
No?
Oh, of course. It's a secret,
so you wouldn't tell me anyway.
Do you mind if I take a look around,
talk to some of your employees?
Mm... No.
Thank you very much. Good luck with the book.
What about him?
Handsome but dim, like a golden retriever.
Natalie would never be interested in someone like that.
Who would she be interested in?
Someone attractive, witty, compassionate,
25 to 35,
Fit, good hair, and a romantic at heart.
Oh, that's all?
No wonder she enlisted the help of a professional.
Good ones are out there, if you know where to look.
Natalie was a college girl. She read voraciously.
She was inquisitive, intelligent, and idealistic.
She would need to be with somebody who was the same.
Him.
You buy me dinner at my restaurant of choice
if I'm right.
No bet. You're right.
He's the only man that didn't look at you.
I'll spring for dinner
If you can get him to confess right now.
Ooh. Bet.
Do your thing.
Uh, you must be...
Uh, Richard. Can I help you?
I'm sorry. Is this a bad time?
I can see you're upset.
What? No. No, I... I'm--I'm fine.
Uh, bad time for--for what?
It's okay. Natalie told me all about you.
I'm... Sorry. Natalie?
You were having an affair with her.
That's ridiculous.
I'm a married man.
Hey, don't worry. I won't tell anyone.
Natalie was a dear friend of mine.
Her passing has been devastating for me.
I can't begin to imagine how you must feel right now.
There's no greater loss than the loss
of the person you love.
I didn't think that she had told anyone.
This is Richard.
So there's this great little place downtown.
Sicilian Chef.
He does wonders with fish-- fresh, simple.
Remarkable.
I'm suddenly hungry.
Hi, Richard.
Yes, we had an argument,
But it wasn't a big deal.
You lied about it. That makes it a big deal.
I didn't think it was relevant.
Your shift ended at 8:00, the same time as Natalie's.
Where'd you go after work?
To dinner with a friend.
Right afterwards?
Yes, about 8:30.
This friend have a name?
Jim Clark.
You don't think I had something to do with this, do you?
This is insane. I didn't kill Natalie.
What were you two arguing about?
She didn't like the way I handled a situation with one of the kids.
She thought you were abusing him?
I got in his face,
maybe pushed him a little bit, okay?
That's it. It wasn't abuse.
Natalie came in here all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
Thinking she was gonna connect with these kids,
And it's a great idea, but it doesn't work.
Sometimes getting physical is the only thing
These animals respond to, you understand?
Yeah, you're right.
Abusing kids is against the law.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Good.
Okay. Thank you. Bye.
well, Richard Eldridge
Will be speaking with one of my colleagues
First thing tomorrow morning.
We make a good team, don't we?
Y-you said you had a question.
Oh, yes. That.
Would you hate me if I told you I was lying?
It's just these days I don't get to spend much time
alone with charming men.
Well, there's a reason for that--
So you don't kill them.
We all have our baggage.
I've been thinking about you a lot
Over the past few months.
I often wonder how things would be,
Had we met under different circumstances.
Thinking about what might have been will drive you crazy.
Much better to think about what will happen in the future.
Erica.
I like you, Patrick.
I hope my directness doesn't make you uncomfortable.
I know what you're doing.
What am I doing?
Seducing me to conceal your true purpose,
Which is to escape.
Am I?
Seducing you?
No.
I'm not trying to escape, Patrick.
In fact, you don't actually believe I am.
No?
No.
Those agents outside the door aren't to keep me from escaping.
They're to keep you and I apart.
I know you have feelings for me.
This whole escape nonsense is just your way
of avoiding those feelings.
No, actually, I'm fairly concerned
you might try to escape.
Then ask yourself this.
If those agents weren't outside the door right now,
what would you do?
What will you do?
What are these?
Pictures Natalie Gibecki took when she was on vacation
in Puerto Vallarta.
I was checking them to see if she met anyone...
when she was down there.
Did she?
Doesn't look like it.
I guess I was done with those.
Natalie and I started seeing each other
about a year ago.
You were having an affair.
Yes...
But I wasn't just stringing her along.
Uh, I planned to leave my wife.
It's just... you know, it's complicated.
Complicated?
Because your wife's family has millions of dollars
And you make minimum wage at a nonprofit?
What did Natalie think about your being married?
She was patient at first.
She knew that I was unhappy.
Recently, she got tired of waiting,
So she broke things off.
When was that?
Two weeks ago.
We hardly spoke during the entire time.
I called her. I asked her to see me.
She wouldn't.
She said she needed to get away,
Clear her head.
And is that why she went to Puerto Vallarta?
Yes.
I just assumed that that was the end.
Then a few days ago, she called.
She wanted to see me.
She was going to meet you the night she was killed?
Yes.
9:00. The same little bar we always go to.
I waited an hour.
When she didn't show, I just...
Uh, I assumed that she had changed her mind.
I-I know that-- that you're just--
You're doing your job, Agent Lisbon.
I would never do this to Natalie.
I couldn't.
Natalie was going to meet you the night she was killed--
A married man she was romantically involved with
Who doesn't have an alibi for the night of her murder.
You'll forgive me if I'm a little skeptical.
what about the boyfriend?
He said he was going to meet Natalie
The night she was killed.
Here's the name of the place.
You and Cho talk to the bartender.
See if anybody remembers seeing him.
Okay.
Where's Erica, getting a mani-pedi?
How'd you know?
All right. This is getting ridiculous.
Erica's served her purpose.
It's time to bring her back to prison.
Oh, we can't do that.
Why not?
I need her.
Mr. Jane, Ms. Flynn, how nice to see you.
You are here as guests?
Uh, well, not--not exactly.
I hope there's not some problem.
Mr. Relin didn't tell you?
Tell me what?
Erica and I are performing tonight.
Just a little something we've been working on.
It's all been arranged.
Um... How fantastic.
Well, let's hope.
thank you.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Patrick Jane.
For tonight and for a very good cause,
Let's all imagine that this, uh, Tawdry hotel ballroom
Is, in fact, the casa encantar,
The enchanted house.
Ladies and gentlemen, my lovely assistant Erica.
Erica and I will conjure up spirits
That will awe and amaze you,
And then we will turn that awed amazement
Into cold, hard cash
That will help feed, clothe, and educate
Thousands of homeless orphans.
As you can see, Erica has set the stage with four boxes.
Now in order for this performance to work,
We need four willing volunteers.
Once you're chosen, please make your way
promptly to the stage.
Don't be shy. This shouldn't hurt one little bit.
A quick hand for these brave souls.
Thank you, Erica.
Looking fetching in green.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
Please pay close attention.
You're about to witness something
That I can pretty much guarantee you've never seen before.
You will see...something clouded in the unknown
In a world of clairvoyants and divination,
A world of spirits.
Now I know some of you don't believe
That spirits exist,
But trust me when I tell you they are very real.
They're here in this room right now speaking to me,
Just as I am speaking to you,
And they're telling me that one of these individuals here
Is harboring a deep, dark secret.
Huh? Don't believe me?
Fantastic. That gives me the chance to prove it to you.
You, Sir. What's your name?
Richard.
Richard, are you here alone?
Yes.
Thank you. Would you step forward?
Inside one of these boxes
Is an item that holds great significance to you.
I don't know which box it's in, and neither do you.
Am I correct?
Correct.
All right, Richard. I need you to concentrate now.
I need you to concentrate and
clear your mind of any distractions.
I would like you to choose two boxes.
Two boxes, either on the left side
Or the right side, please.
Erica.
There's two boxes left.
I'd like you to choose one, Richard.
Now you made your choice only
with the spirits as your guide?
Yes.
Erica, if you would, open the box, please.
Does this necklace mean anything to you, Richard?
yes.
Tell the audience what it means, Richard.
it's the necklace that I gave to Natalie.
Why did you give it to her?
It was a symbol of my deep and abiding...
love... For her.
It's okay. It's okay.
Thank you, Richard.
If you'll make your way back to your seat. That's okay.
Wait! The spirits are sending me another message.
They're telling me that someone else on this stage
Has a secret.
Mr. Relin.
thank you.
A crowd favorite.
You're harboring a deep, dark secret, aren't you?
I don't think so.
Oh, really?
Well, let's check, shall we? Step forward, please.
Clear your mind and choose two boxes.
Erica.
Now you know the drill. One box.
Thank you.
Now you chose this box of your own free will, yes?
I guess so.
Erica, please do the honors. Open the box.
Is this photograph of any significance to you?
No.
Are you certain?
Well, perhaps if you saw it bigger.
Erica?
Now do you recognize it?
It looks like the site you claim to
have built an orphanage on,
Only there's no orphanage.
I don't... I don't know what you're talking about.
What about now?
This's a photo taken a week ago.
There is no orphanage, Greg,
Only a doctored photograph you've been passing off as real.
Everything you've said you've done is a lie, greg.
You don't understand.
Oh, but I think they do.
You're under arrest.
Let's go.
Uh, thank you. You've been a lovely audience.
Thank you and good night.
You embezzled millions of dollars meant for charity
and siphoned the money into your own pockets.
You had everybody fooled
until Natalie took that trip to Mexico.
Natalie called me, said she needed
to speak with me about something important,
so I met her after work at the subway station.
I offered her a ride.
She told me she had visited
one of the orphanages that we built.
And she accused you of lying.
No.
Not at first. She trusted me.
She wanted an explanation, but...
I didn't have one. What could I say?
She had the photos.
My whole world was threatened.
Everything I've built will be gone.
Okay. I'm coming.
Wayne.
In here.
Ohh. What is going on with you?
Take a seat.
Sarah, I, uh...
There's something I have to say to you.
Okay.
So I've been thinking a lot about us
these last few days...
And, uh... Our situation.
"Our situation"?
Yeah...
And, uh... I want it to change.
Are you breaking up with me?
The opposite.
Will you marry me?
Oh, no.
No?
I don't want to get married like this.
Uh, like what?
Wayne, I don't want you to propose to me
just because I'm pregnant.
It's--it's-- it's so not fair to you or to me.
I don't want to live the rest of my life
constantly wondering whether my husband loves me.
Wayne. Gosh, you are...
You are a great man.
No, and you are going to be
the most amazing father...
really, but...
gosh, we are just not ready for this.
Thank you, Patrick.
You have no idea how much this meant to me.
You know, you didn't have to leave the other night.
We can't have everything we want.
Since when?
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go freshen up before the car ride.
Don't bother. I know about your lawyer.
Lawyer? What lawyer?
We found him a block away
with two suitcases, cash,
and a forged passport.
I'm sorry, Erica.
I love you! I'll wait for you!
Touching.
So it's over.
You can't blame a girl for trying.
I'd expect nothing less.
It was nice to see you, Patrick.
I had a lovely time.
Me, too.
Good-bye.
Well, when you say it like that,
It makes it sound like forever.
Just 15 to 20.
All right. Just sign here?
Yes, sir. Bottom of the page.
Time to go, ma'am.
Of course.
Glad that all worked out.
Yeah.
Special Agent Luther Wainright?
I'm officer Hopkins
from Golden Valley State Correctional Institution.
We're here to take custody of Erica Flynn.
I'm sorry. I'm confused.
I just signed custody...
Sir?
The U.S. Marshals are helping with the search.
She's been flagged on flight lists
and all border crossings.
You're wasting your time.
Thanks for your optimism.
I have to ask, Jane.
Did you know Erica was gonna do this?
Try to escape?
Of course. I mean, who wouldn't?
You didn't answer my question.
No, I didn't...
answer your question.
Hello?
Hello, Patrick.
I wanted to thank you for dinner the other night.
It was the best date I've had in years.
It wasn't a date.
If you say so.
Where are you?
Someplace warm.
Why? Do you miss me?
Something like that.
You know, Patrick, we'd have been good together.
Would be good together.
I will find you. It's only a matter of time.
Oh, Patrick.
