for over a century i have lived in secret .
until now .
i know the risk , but i have to know her .
what are you ?
i &apos;m a vampire .
you must be ms. pierce .
please . call me katherine .
i was never in love with you , katherine .
so none of my feelings were real .
believe what you want , stefan .
but i know the truth .
so , the black sheep returns .
tyler ?
who &apos;s the guy with carol ?
mason lockwood .
you know where i can find any family artifact stuff ?
i &apos;m just lookin &apos; for this old piece of my mom &apos;s .
it &apos;s a moonstone .
i think the lockwoods have a family secret .
they &apos;re not vampires . they &apos;re something else .
the lycanthrope .
werewolves ?
it was you .
i &apos;ve had her blood . katherine obviously killed her .
&quot; a &quot; plus &quot; b &quot; equals ...
i &apos;m starving .
katherine .
don &apos;t be frightened .
we &apos;re going to have so much fun together .
look who found his dancing shoes .
uh ! no touching , mr. salvatore . those are the rules .
i thought you didn &apos;t believe in rules .
my brother &apos;s still upset that you chose me to escort you .
well , damon needs to concede
that his younger brother is a better dancer .
oh , looks like he found someone to occupy his time .
elena ...
stefan , don &apos;t .
elena !
it &apos;s your turn .
be prepared to lose .
it hurts , doesn &apos;t it ?
now you know how i feel .
don &apos;t fight it , stefan . you loved me once .
you can love me again .
i love you , stefan .
we &apos;ll be together again .
i promise .
hey . you ok ?
yes . bad dream .
go back to sleep .
katherine .
you have to admit i am getting better at this .
it was easy to get inside of your head .
have you completely forsaken your nature ?
are we really going to do this again ?
we both know i could rip you to shreds
and do my nails at the same time .
what do you want ?
i wanted to see you .
i &apos;ve missed you , stefan .
indulge me for a little while , please ?
why are you back in town ?
3 reasons .
you , you , and you .
see , i can &apos;t quite get that down .
it just kind of--ahem-- gets stuck in my throat .
you know , it &apos;s the truth .
deep down inside that gorgeous body of yours
is the stefan that fell in love with me , too .
what do you want ?
so this is where you spend your time
when you &apos;re not stabbing people in the back .
i tricked you into telling me the truth .
that &apos;s not stabbing you in the back .
that &apos;s using your own tactics against you .
where are you going ?
i made myself clear , damon .
i want nothing to do with you .
ok . see you at jenna &apos;s barbecue .
how did you know about jenna &apos;s barbecue ?
it was my idea .
jenna went to high school with mason lockwood .
so i figured a social gathering would be a good way
to get to know the guy .
so , i told rick to tell jenna ...
does jenna know that you &apos;re going to be there ?
because she &apos;s not exactly a fan of yours .
thank you .
i &apos;m hoping this peach cobbler will pave the way .
what are you up to ?
i &apos;m gonna go put some silver into mason lockwood
and prove he &apos;s a werewolf .
see you at the barbecue .
hey , mason , you got a second ?
nah , man , barbecue at jenna sommer &apos;s house .
come on , give me 2 minutes . all right ?
you can &apos;t keep dodging me . i &apos;m freaking out over here .
tyler , what do you want me to say , man ?
yes , i turned into a wolf .
no , it &apos;s not gonna happen to you .
how do you know that ?
because you &apos;re not gonna trigger the curse .
your dad didn &apos;t know anything about any of this .
neither did i till it happened to me .
how does it get triggered ?
ignorance is bliss . trust me .
you blow back into town with some supernatural family secret
and you expect me not to ask questions ?
i can &apos;t say anything more . i &apos;m sorry , tyler .
it &apos;s just better for you if i don &apos;t .
you ever find that moonstone ?
do you know where it is ?
what &apos;s so special about it ?
i told you . it was my mom &apos;s .
it &apos;s sentimental .
look , don &apos;t worry about it .
forget i even brought it up , all right .
see ya later .
you shouldn &apos;t read someone &apos;s journal .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
it was just too tempting , all your inner thoughts and feelings ,
laying there on your desk for me to read .
damon &apos;s private stock .
that &apos;s right ! you don &apos;t do human .
i read that .
i also read about your recent werewolf sighting .
that must have come as a surprise .
what do you know about werewolves ?
i know not to pet one .
their bite kills , stefan .
it &apos;s best to stay clear of them during a full moon .
and how do you know this ?
who do you think was responsible
for ridding this town of vampires in 1864 ?
the founding families .
spearheaded by ?
the lockwoods .
you remember the founder &apos;s ball , don &apos;t you ?
the one that you were dreaming about ?
i was your escort .
that was before you and damon knew about my little secret .
everyone , will you please join me in raising your glasses
to my good friend george lockwood .
george , thank you for so bravely defending the south .
my honor , mr. salvatore .
after all , someone had to do it .
may i have a word , miss katherine ?
grab a glass , henry . it &apos;s a celebration .
please , miss katherine .
i looked into those attacks from the other night .
it wasn &apos;t vampires .
that &apos;s good news , henry .
that means we have nothing to worry about .
i &apos;m afraid you don &apos;t understand .
those folks were torn apart in ways i &apos;ve never seen before .
then ...
it won &apos;t be long before the founders draw up an investigation .
we &apos;ll leave town immediately . i &apos;ll tell the others .
relax , henry .
this is town is our home ,
and the vampires are my family .
i won &apos;t let anything happen to us .
from the moment i met george ,
i knew he &apos;d be a problem .
so , you &apos;re saying that all the lockwoods are werewolves ?
the werewolf gene runs in the lockwood family .
not that they &apos;re all wolves .
how many other werewolves are out there ?
i mean , is it just ... limited to the lockwoods ?
no . there are others . not many .
they &apos;re practically extinct .
they mainly exist now in books and really bad movies .
my turn to ask a question .
why did you keep this picture ?
why not burn it ? tear it up ?
you wanna know why i came back ?
well , i have a better question .
why did you ?
for elena ?
no .
you came back here to fall
in love with me all over again , didn &apos;t you ?
what is it about you ...
that makes me still care ?
now , where were we ?
that &apos;s right .
you were gonna tell me why
you came back to mystic falls , weren &apos;t you ?
you didn &apos;t have to do this .
answer the question .
i came back for you .
we &apos;re gonna play by my rules now .
what are you doing ?
answer the question .
you &apos;re going to torture me now ?
i &apos;m going to do whatever
it takes to get you to tell me the truth .
later that night at the founder &apos;s ball--
i don &apos;t wanna hear anymore stories about the past .
yes , you do , stefan .
that &apos;s exactly what you want to hear .
she &apos;s all alone .
does this mean i can finally have you all to myself ?
your father &apos;s outdone himself .
knowing father , he &apos;ll want to
throw a founders party every year .
i must admit i am rather
surprised that you &apos;d come looking for me .
because you &apos;re the rope in the salvatore brother &apos;s tug @-@ of @-@ war ?
no , because i &apos;m a vampire
who could kill you in your sleep .
i beg your pardon ?
relax , george .
i know you know my secret .
this conversation is over .
and i know your secret , too .
and i know that you &apos;re extra strong . only not as strong .
how do you know who i am ?
you think that i would
settle into a town without knowing my enemies ?
what do you want ?
what did he want ?
thanks for letting me invite caroline .
she could use a day of distraction .
she &apos;s not the plus one i &apos;m worried about .
why is damon coming ?
because alaric is a pity @-@ taker .
come on , jenna . be nice .
i &apos;ll be nice when damon learns to keep his paws off you .
ahh , good news . found the shot glasses .
that would be my exit .
you &apos;re here for 10 minutes and already i &apos;m back
under the bleachers at the pep rally .
just like old times , huh ?
only i didn &apos;t swipe this bottle from my old man .
oh , the expensive stuff . i like you already .
just happy to be invited .
thank rick . this was his idea .
really ?
yeah . well , you know .
i thought it &apos;d be nice to
meet some of jenna &apos;s old high school friends .
dig up a little dirt .
oh , i &apos;ve got dirt . i &apos;ve got dirt .
i have no secrets . only dirty shame .
to dirty shame .
cheers .
damon .
we were just doing shots . let me get you a shot glass , buddy .
here .
use mine .
she doesn &apos;t like me very much .
we haven &apos;t met . mason lockwood .
oh , sure . hey . damon salvatore .
i know . i &apos;ve heard great things about you .
really ? that &apos;s weird . &apos; cause i &apos;m a dick .
hey . i &apos;m just checking in .
did you get my message about jenna &apos;s barbecue ?
call me when you can .
was that stefan ?
he hasn &apos;t called me back .
i &apos;m trying to decide if i should be worried .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s fine .
god , i cannot stop eating .
stefan says it &apos;s a great way to sublimate the cravings .
it &apos;s horrible .
fighting the urge for blood every minute of every day .
i know stefan really hates that part of himself .
well , yeah . and he hates that you &apos;re a constant temptation .
he said that ?
hmm . the desire to rip out your jugular
every time he &apos;s with you ?
trust me , it &apos;s there .
it &apos;s why i had to break up with matt .
hey , food &apos;s ready . come get it .
finally . i am starving .
we can sit here as long as you want .
and when you start to desiccate ,
there &apos;s a tomb with your name on it .
i &apos;ve been doing all the talking . it &apos;s your turn .
do you pretend to be human when you &apos;re with elena ?
is that the appeal ?
actually , i don &apos;t pretend to be anything
when i &apos;m with her .
that &apos;s the whole point .
i get to just be myself .
does she know that you love me ?
i don &apos;t .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong , stefan .
don &apos;t you remember bringing me home that night ?
your family had taken me in .
i had a lovely time , stefan .
how long do you plan on staying in mystic falls ?
as long as i &apos;m wanted .
your father has been very kind to give me shelter .
how could not ?
losing your family in the fire .
i &apos;m grateful you made it out of atlanta .
so , i gather i &apos;m wanted ?
very much so .
i know we &apos;ve only known each other for a short while .
and i know i &apos;m in competition for your affections .
but ...
i &apos;ve never met a woman quite like you .
i look at you and i see an angel .
i touch your skin ...
and my entire body ignites .
i kiss you and i know that i &apos;m falling in love .
i am in love with you .
there &apos;s just so much you don &apos;t know about me , stefan .
more to learn and love .
i must say goodnight .
i &apos;ve upset you ?
no .
you haven &apos;t upset me .
you &apos;ve just surprised me .
till tomorrow .
what are you doing here ?
i told you i would come .
well , i &apos;m tired . you should go .
did my little brother &apos;s confession overwhelm you ?
you shouldn &apos;t eavesdrop .
is my love not enough ?
i told you . i &apos;m tired .
i wish to be alone tonight . please leave .
good night , katherine .
go ahead , stefan .
torture me , keep me captive ,
drain me of blood until my body turns to dust .
it &apos;ll never change the truth .
i never compelled your love .
it was real . and so was mine .
dress ! ballerina !
puppy ! puppy !
puppy with a tutu .
no .
dog . hound dog .
you ain &apos;t nothing but a hound dog !
&quot; dances with wolves . &quot;
mason wins ... again .
how is that a wolf ? !
aunt jenna &apos;s getting tipsy .
will you stop playing her with alcohol ?
i want her to like me .
how &apos;s operation lockwood ?
he &apos;s my new bff .
there you are .
isn &apos;t this fun ?
yes . thank you so much for inviting me .
did i have a choice ?
i know what you must think about me .
no , you don &apos;t .
you &apos;ve never dated you . i have dated many yous .
well , i &apos;m a work in progress .
these are fancy .
thanks . my mother &apos;s silver set .
hearing the truth after a century and a half of denial
must be overwhelming .
it wasn &apos;t real . i remember you compelling me .
only after i showed you who i really was .
you were so scared of me .
i had to take away your fear .
well , whatever feelings i had back then ...
they &apos;ve all turned to hate .
love , hate .
such a fine line .
i can wait .
anyway , george lockwood was causing all sorts of trouble .
he used the vampires to cover up his own tracks .
he told the founding families about us .
but he was willing to strike a deal .
what kind of a deal ?
a deal to rid the town of vampires .
i just spoke to giuseppe salvatore .
mm @-@ hmm .
the round @-@ up happens tonight .
good . insist that they do a body count
before they set the church is set ablaze .
i will .
27 vampires .
once the flames create chaos ,
crawl to the exit under the choir loft .
i &apos;ll be there to set you free .
make sure you &apos;re not followed .
i need everyone to believe that i perished in that fire .
you knew that they &apos;re going to burn the vampires in the church ?
i practically lit the match .
they were your friends . they were your family .
you just sold them out ?
without blinking .
mason .
why don &apos;t you start us off .
sure .
what ? i apologize . i &apos;m an animal .
so , mason , you and jenna never dated ?
she was always lost in logan fell @-@ land .
oh , my first mistake .
mason was a catch .
he had girls lining up .
really ? !
huh . i pegged you for a lone wolf .
i &apos;m sure i wasn &apos;t half the lady killer you were .
how about a toast ?
to new friends .
cheers !
would i be the worst friend
in the world if i abandoned you and went to stefan &apos;s ?
you want to leave ?
it &apos;s just that he hasn &apos;t gotten back to me .
and i &apos;m starting to get this bad feeling .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea , elena .
damon &apos;s got it under control here .
take it from me , there &apos;s nothing worse than a clingy girlfriend .
i &apos;m not being clingy . i &apos;m just concerned .
you understand , right ?
how about i drive you ?
yeah . ok . that &apos;d be great . thanks .
yeah .
what did george get in return for giving you your freedom ?
something he wanted desperately .
so you sent 26 of your friends
to their death just to fake your own ?
no . you were running from something . what was it ?
everyone has a past , stefan .
mine needed to stay far , far away .
but thanks to you , my plan nearly failed
before it even began .
once george told me that the roundup was imminent ,
i made sure i could see you one last time .
vervain !
what ?
but your father used your love for me against you .
katherine !
he poisoned your blood .
we don &apos;t have long .
then damon , being damon ,
nearly ruined everything .
no !
we came for you . we tried to save you .
i didn &apos;t want to be saved .
then damon and i died for nothing . for nothing !
no , stefan . you died for love !
jenna just brought out &quot; guitar hero . &quot;
it might be time to mutiny .
well , i just i happen to like &quot; guitar hero . &quot;
so you , my friend , are barking up the wrong tree .
ok , enough with the innuendos .
you win . you &apos;re hilarious .
thank you .
come on , man ,
you don &apos;t think i know what this barbecue is about ?
how do you know about me ?
your brother was completely clueless .
it doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;m not your enemy , damon .
you tried to kill my brother .
that was a mistake .
really ?
there was confusion .
i couldn &apos;t chain myself up in time .
i have no control once i shift .
what , no obedience school ?
i &apos;m serious .
let &apos;s not spark some age @-@ old feud that doesn &apos;t apply to us .
you expect me to believe that
you &apos;re in mystic falls planting peace trees ?
i lost my brother .
my nephew lost his father .
i &apos;m here for my family .
let &apos;s be above this .
thanks for this . i appreciate it .
here we come ... to the rescue .
why are you being so snippy ?
that &apos;s my own drama .
i &apos;m sure that you two will beat the odds .
not that there &apos;s any study to pull odds from .
what is the ratio of success for vampire / human couplings ?
i &apos;m guessing nil .
ok , caroline .
sorry .
i love this song .
what &apos;s playing ?
playing we radiate goldfrapp .
oh ... crap .
no takers for more drinks at the grill ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;m with a bunch of adults here .
i prefer the term role model .
ok . well , thanks for having me . it was awesome .
alaric , catch that game next week ?
yeah . looking forward to it .
hey , you know , i should probably head out , too .
jenna ...
you are a wonderful hostess .
and you are a terrible artist .
is that the only thing that makes me terrible ?
still deciding .
good enough for me .
alaric ...
let &apos;s not catch that game next week .
are you sure the tow &apos;s coming ?
we &apos;ve been waiting forever .
i know . it &apos;s weird .
they said they &apos;d be here by now .
yeah .
i &apos;m just gonna call jenna .
no !
let me try the tow people again .
and i &apos;ll use my aggro voice .
we can just walk from here .
i can &apos;t just leave my car .
we &apos;ll come back for it .
just give me a minute , elena .
caroline , what part of
&quot; i &apos;m worried about stefan &quot; didn &apos;t sink in ?
what &apos;s the rush ?
why are you hurrying to get to a relationship that &apos;ll never work ?
ok . look , i know that you &apos;re upset over matt ,
but will you stop projecting it onto me and stefan , please ?
i &apos;m not projecting anything .
you &apos;re human . he &apos;s a vampire .
you &apos;re going to be 70 and in diapers ,
and he &apos;s still gonna be smoking hot .
and you will never have his children , elena .
and you are too maternal to not have children .
where is this coming from ?
i &apos;m just trying to be your friend .
ok . well , do me a favor and stop trying .
there &apos;s the tow . i &apos;m gonna walk .
no . elena , don &apos;t--
aah . caroline , you &apos;re hurting me .
don &apos;t leave me alone .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
hey there . someone call about a flat tire ?
she did .
damon .
what ? more dog jokes ?
nah . those got old .
you know ...
i think it was werewolves who started this whole silver myth .
probably for moments like this .
duly noted .
i was really looking forward to last call .
now you made an enemy .
so you going to tell me why you came back here ?
or were you just playing another game ?
have you not heard a word that i &apos;ve said ?
i &apos;ve answered that question 5 times over now .
all right . good . make it six .
i want what i want , stefan .
and i don &apos;t care what i have to do to get it .
my list of victims is a long one .
and i have no problem adding one more name to that list .
come on , katherine .
if you wanted elena dead ,
you would have done it by now .
i still can .
if i have to ,
i will snap her neck like a twig .
and you know it .
guess you don &apos;t hate me as much as you thought you did .
i don &apos;t want you seeing elena anymore .
if you don &apos;t remove her from your life ,
i will kill everyone that she loves while she watches ,
and then i will kill her while you watch .
don &apos;t you ever think for one moment that i will not kill you .
i have been sipping vervain
every single day for the last 145 years .
you caught me by surprise once ,
i wasn &apos;t going to let it happen again .
it doesn &apos;t hurt me , stefan .
what--why--
i told you .
i &apos;ve missed you , stefan .
i just wanted to spend some time with you .
hello ?
stefan ?
stefan ?
you must be elena .
how is this possible ?
how do we look exactly alike ?
you &apos;re asking the wrong questions .
elena .
are you ok ?
not really .
are you ok ?
not really .
katherine .
care to share how you
couldn &apos;t follow through with one simple task ?
i tried , ok ?
but i couldn &apos;t exactly kidnap my best friend .
occupy her . that &apos;s all i asked .
i told her that her relationship was doomed .
and all that mortality stuff .
i think i--i--
i really think that i got to her .
i hope so .
because let &apos;s not forget . i already killed you once .
i can easily do it again .
how was that barbecue ?
not great . you still pissed ?
you still keeping secrets ?
yep .
then i &apos;m still pissed .
hey , you know , i was thinking
about that stone you &apos;re looking for .
i might know a couple places it could be .
do you think this is a joke ?
if you know where it is then tell me .
tell me how the curse is triggered .
if i tell you , you won &apos;t be able to think about anything else .
i don &apos;t want that for you .
i think i can handle knowing .
yeah . you think you can handle it , tough guy ?
you have no idea !
do you want your stupid rock or not ? !
tell me where it is .
tell me what triggers the curse !
you have to kill somebody !
human blood !
you take a person &apos;s life away from them ,
then the curse is yours forever .
can you handle that ?
elena .
oh my god , i am so sorry about earlier today .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know what came over me .
it &apos;s ok , caroline .
everything that you were saying was right .
it &apos;s just hard for me to hear , you know ?
so you &apos;re not mad at me ?
you were just being a good friend ... in your own way .
my own head @-@ case ,
horrible way .
elena , i really am sorry .
i &apos;m starving .
well , spending a day with your jealous ex
will do that to you .
listen , i know you &apos;re upset .
all right , but ...
we have to take her seriously .
today was all about the lengths that she &apos;ll go to .
if she was going to hurt me , she would have .
i was standing right in front of her .
elena , you caught her off guard .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re safe .
i &apos;m not afraid of her .
well , you should be .
if katherine had her way ,
we &apos;d be breaking up right now .
and if today taught me anything ,
it &apos;s that katherine &apos;s used to getting her way .
you &apos;re not actually saying that we should do what she says .
listen , she &apos;s sadistic .
ok . she threatened you .
she threatened everyone .
yeah . no . i get it , ok . she &apos;s dangerous .
but every day that we &apos;re together . it &apos;s dangerous .
why are you giving her so much power
over our relationship ?
this is the reality of our situation .
reality sucks .
this is what she wants , stefan .
she wants us to fight .
she wants get between us .
she already has , elena .
bad day ?
bad century .
i heard you were on the loose .
what &apos;s the matter ? jealous i spent the day with stefan ?
i don &apos;t do jealous . not with you .
not anymore .
then why so pouty ?
i tried to kill a werewolf and failed .
now i feel like i &apos;m not living up to my best self .
well , werewolves aren &apos;t easy prey .
what do you know about werewolves ?
why don &apos;t you ask your brother ?
don &apos;t try to be the hero , damon . you &apos;ll end up dead .
been there , done that .
at least this time it will have been worth it .
you ok ?
i hated that fight .
i know , me , too . it felt too real .
did you see caroline ?
yeah .
we were right . katherine got to her .
she was hanging on to every single word .
then it won &apos;t be long before katherine gets a play @-@ by @-@ play .
i wish i was wrong ,
but i know caroline too well .
it was so obvious that something was up today .
you &apos;re not wrong . it &apos;s pure katherine .
she &apos;s always finding somebody to do her dirty work .
i think damon was listening to us fight , too .
are you gonna tell him that it wasn &apos;t real ?
the only way katherine &apos;s gonna believe it
is if everybody believes it .
it &apos;s the best way to make her think she &apos;s getting what she wants .
all this ...
just to get you back .
that &apos;s not why she &apos;s here . ok ?
no matter what she says .
i know her .
katherine doesn &apos;t care about anybody but herself .
she never has .
she &apos;s incapable of love .
she &apos;s here for another reason .
george .
your carriage is waiting .
well done , george . thank you .
now on to your part of the deal .
if anyone learns of my escape ,
i will find you . and i will kill you .
don &apos;t think that i won &apos;t .
we shall take each other &apos;s secrets to our grave .
now you must hurry .
i love you , stefan .
we will be together again .
