i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t do it .
oh , of course you can and you will .
okay , schmidt , we &apos;ve been to 11 weddings in a row .
that &apos;s too many weddings .
i can &apos;t even get into the fridge anymore .
i &apos;m so hungry .
why does everybody get to have a party
for everything in their life ?
why can &apos;t i have a party
for really dedicating myself to knitting this summer ?
god , i hate that you knit . i hate everything about it .
why ?
it makes me angry and scared all at the same time .
just like when i hear the phrase ,
&quot; academy award winner anna paquin . &quot;
jessica , you are going to this wedding .
and i &apos;m gonna tell you why : sexual intercourse .
do you remember that ?
you got to get back out there , jess .
the last mouth that you kissed
was nick &apos;s mouth .
that was four months ago .
think about that . that &apos;s horrible .
hey . is schmidt making fun of me ?
yes .
hi , nick .
okay , cool . just checking .
are you wearing tap shoes ?
i got &apos; em at the goodwill .
i thought they were just really shiny dress shoes .
they &apos;re cool .
hey , what do you guys think about this belt ?
like for a wedding gift ?
nick , coach , get in here .
everybody in here .
are we a man down ?
i feel like there &apos;s one more of us .
something &apos;s going on in jess &apos; room ? !
i &apos;m coming !
just wait for me .
he &apos;s sore from police academy .
i &apos;m sore from police academy !
okay , we have gone to wedding after wedding this summer ,
and , with the exception of coach and myself ,
none of us have truly taken advantage
of the sexual opportunities
that a wedding provides .
not true .
wedding number seven , an unneutered dog ran after me ,
so ...
i made out with a bridesmaid .
you did !
yes .
she was wearing a hospital bracelet
and carrying a dead goldfish in a bag .
she was still a bridesmaid .
she looked like the snowman from frozen .
hey , aim for the middle .
the ride &apos;s rough at first , but the body adjusts .
i &apos;m all right ! i just rolled off the couch .
winston , please !
i can &apos;t close my ass !
we are hooking up tonight , all five of us ,
including the gimp .
this is the last wedding of summer ,
which means it is our last chance .
nobody meets anybody in fall ...
no .
or winter . what , are you gonna gamble
on the unknown contents of a bulky sweater ?
not me .
do you realize how important this is ?
i do .
winter ... is coming .
no one comes home alone .
you know what , yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m in .
she &apos;s in .
we &apos;re all in .
yeah .
yes .
i &apos;m in .
i can &apos;t hear what &apos;s going on ,
but i &apos;m in .
all five of us out there together ,
in the wild ,
getting some strange , like a sex fist .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
mm , that &apos;s not what you mean .
what &apos;s a sex fist , now ?
one , two , three , four ,
five of us , together , make a fist .
you &apos;re making a mistake right now .
schmidt , nick ,
coach , winston , jess-- sex fist .
when you put them all together ,
no , that &apos;s not right .
tearing our way through the reception .
slow down .
are you listening to what you &apos;re saying ?
isn &apos;t that sweet ? it &apos;s a metaphor for togetherness .
it could just be a fist .
all five of us
sex @-@ fisting our way ...
hi , everybody . uh , i &apos;m ted . i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m mark &apos;s best friend and his best man .
i @-@ i &apos;ve known mark since he was in diapers , you know ?
uh , and , by that , i mean junior year of college .
ah , what about him , jess ?
what ? the best man ?
best man .
get real , you clown .
i &apos;ve been out of the game too long .
he &apos;s a wedding celebrity .
everybody say hi to nana .
how great does nana look , everybody ?
give it up for nana .
six months sober .
i &apos;m kidding . three months .
jess , come on . get in there .
what ?
you got this .
think so ?
yes , you got the bangs parted .
you &apos;re looking good .
really ?
yes .
okay .
wait a minute . hold on .

i &apos;m coach .
oh , my god .
you don &apos;t remember me ?
yeah ...
yeah , i remember ...
i &apos;m good .
it &apos;s the end of the wedding season .
we &apos;ve got some repeats .
oh , god . what is she doing here ?
i thought she was in australia .
how do i look ?
how @-@ how jewish ?
i mean , like , good jewish or bad jewish ?
oh , i won &apos;t say-- it feels like a trap .
come on . come with me .
i haven &apos;t told the guys
that you broke up with buster yet , &apos; cause , um ...
i feel like i might have to tell schmidt
outside a hospital ,
like , you know , when you give a baby
peanut butter for the first time ?
yeah .
you &apos;re not doing this tonight .
what ?
you &apos;re not doing this tonight .
i &apos;m not listening to you .
you &apos;re not doing this tonight .
i &apos;m picturing cece naked .
stop doing this !
cece has a boyfriend ,
and your obsession with her
is not good for you , man .
she &apos;s been away all summer ,
and you have been killing it !
mostly hand stuff .
who had sex with a bridesmaid
on a 45 @-@ minute flight to san jose ?
me .
you were boarding group &quot; d. &quot;
she was &quot; b. &quot; how &apos;s that even possible ?
gotta think outside of the box , my man .
now get your little white butt back out there
and finish the summer of sex that you started .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
cece gone .
see that bridesmaid right there ?
the pretty one ?
sure do .
the foxy lady ?
mm @-@ hmm .
well , you &apos;re going home with her tonight .
and i got your back .
look at that .
she looks like the girl from the commercial
playing tennis with a tampon in .
let &apos;s do it .
hi . i &apos;m jess .
hi . i &apos;m ted .
cheers .
cheers .
so you &apos;re from wisconsin ...
i &apos;m sorry . is this thing on ?
you &apos;re making your throat like a microphone .
yeah .
that &apos;s funny !
thank you .
yeah .
i loved your speech .
oh .
hi .
i &apos;m kat . hi .
i &apos;m ted .
really nice to meet you .
yeah . oh .
excuse me .
my girlfriend &apos;s getting jealous .
perfect specimen .
ted is the only eligible guy here ,
and we are his two best options for procreation .
oh . i &apos;m not trying to intimidate you ,
i just want you to know who you &apos;re dealing with
if we &apos;re both gonna compete for this man tonight .
what ?
here are the facts :
i am technically a genius ,
i have a photographic memory
and i lost my virginity to malcolm gladwell .
okay ...
have you ever heard of plutoxic syndrome ?
that &apos;s because i cured it .
you &apos;re welcome , vaginas everywhere .
oh , thank you very much .
i &apos;m sorry , that was ...
vagina voice , and a ...
it was a huge mistake .
i stay current on sporting events .
i watch 30 minutes of porn every night
just to stay up to date on the latest sex trends .
in the coming months ,
i &apos;m predicting a throwback to missionary .
it all depends on what happens in syria .
well , have you ever had sex
when you were really , really , really , really ,
really , really tired ?
i &apos;m never tired .
i &apos;m the better choice of mate .
from a purely biological standpoint ,
you &apos;re shorter , weaker , and dumber .
no offense . i love those shoes .
i love your shoes .
but i love your shoes .
your shoes .
no , i love your shoes .
your shoes .
your shoes .
your shoes .
your shoes .
what ?
i was just moving my mouth .
so you &apos;re competing with her ?
i can take her down ,
because i have something she doesn &apos;t have :
you guys .
now , strategies .
what about you , coach ?
you hook up at weddings all the time .
what &apos;s your strategy ?
it &apos;s called being a gorgeous black man
with the body of an action figure .
i could give that a try .
you want to know what your ex @-@ boyfriend
thinks you should do to get the guy ?
no , i don &apos;t . that &apos;s super weird .
yeah , it &apos;s too weird , so ... somebody else .
okay , look , babe , just get out on the dance floor , okay ?
guys think that they way you dance is the way you have sex .
okay .
so just give them a little something , okay ?
you just need to , like , roll your body a little bit .
something a little sexy .
pop your hip out a little bit .
hey , man , i &apos;m not gonna lie to you right now .
i &apos;ve got a halfie .
okay , we got to go !
excuse me , everybody !
i need a minute .
what do you think of this ?
i &apos;m good to go now .
let &apos;s go !
all right .
i just want to get back out there ,
but i feel like i forgot everything i knew .
do you guys still like an oakland face with an l.a. booty ?
would you like to know my strategy , jess ?
is the art of seduction really where you shine ?
be there .
that &apos;s it ?
yeah . just be there .
no matter where he goes , be there .
he gets a drink , be there .
he talks to his friends , be there .
at the end of the night , be there .
it &apos;s called &quot; the joe biden . &quot;
一生都在为当总统而奋斗死乞白赖不屈不挠
that &apos;s creepy , man .
the basic concept of what he &apos;s saying , though ,
could actually work .
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna biden his ass .
oh , yeah . yup . that &apos;ll do it .
i know .
oh , hey ! uh , you know ,
kat was just telling me about her hairlessness .
hmm . she &apos;s like a seal .
hmm . that &apos;s okay .
you guys talk .
i &apos;m just gonna be here .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t call you .
why are you so scared of intimacy ?
who broke your heart and why haven &apos;t you forgiven her ?
uh ... well ... yeah , the thi ...
you &apos;re arrogant , you &apos;re sexist ...
you stole my phone charger .
you &apos;re conceited . you &apos;re a liar .
i rented best man holiday .
you &apos;re not in it .
so , you know tom ...
uh , tom , of course , he wanted to sell shoes for a profit .
and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
i said , &quot; you ...
you do something better . &quot;
you got a ... pretty good face .
so , you guys want to come home with us , right ?
we want to do a four @-@ way .

i &apos;ve found 15 other girls since i &apos;ve been here .
they &apos;re all either married
or taken or mad at coach .
i &apos;m not doing a four @-@ way with you ...
it &apos;s the last helicopter out of saigon , my man .
charlie won .
no , schmidt .
you won &apos;t even know it &apos;s me , nick .
look , at this point , it &apos;s all skin and shapes ...
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s what i &apos;m afraid of .
it @-@ it &apos;s the fog of war , man .
there &apos;s so much stuff going on .
you &apos;re just , you &apos;re just , you &apos;re just here .
you don &apos;t even know what &apos;s happening .
but i want to know what &apos;s happening
if it &apos;s with sex-- i don &apos;t want some
fog of war on top of me , if it looks like you .
that &apos;s the point .
the fog of war is something you can &apos;t see through .
like , the whole thing with the charlie thing
and vietnam , i don &apos;t know who i &apos;m fighting !
i &apos;m soft like a lady . you won &apos;t even know .
but what if i get a surprise ?
&quot; a surprise &quot; ?
what if there &apos;s a surprise on me ?
there &apos;s not gonna be a surprise on you .
what if i &apos;m fighting the war and boom-- there &apos;s a surprise !
you go north , i go south .
do you know what i &apos;m saying ?
i &apos;ll be in steerage and i &apos;m rowing .
and i &apos;m rowing and i &apos;m rowing and the ....

fre @-@ fresh air up there , man .
and i &apos;m in the trenches , you know ?
i &apos;m digging for coal .
i &apos;m breathing in those fumes .
and you &apos;re up here . you &apos;re just taking in the sights .

covered in salty sea spray ...
i don &apos;t want you calling me handsome
before a potential four @-@ way !

i &apos;m begging you for this .
cece is here .
and i can &apos;t get her out of my head .

i need your help , please .
what &apos;s up , guys ?
tell you what . i am so sore
i can &apos;t have sex with nobody tonight .
only thing i want in my mouth is mr. and mrs. i.b. profen .
minus the mister .
my man-- winston , i got a question for you .
do you think that , that two men
can engage in group sex without ...
without compromising their friendship .
good question , good question .
uh , let &apos;s just say
nick is the salt .
and , schmidt , you are the pepper .
i &apos;m assuming we &apos;re talking about you two .
hypothetically , i suppose .
whatever . yes .
hypothetically , all right .
not necessarily .
actually i &apos;m gonna need some ...
ooh , boy .
seems as if i &apos;ve made a mess .
got to clean that up .
yes , look at that .
salt all in the pepper .
pepper all in the salt .
just mixed up like that .
is there salt shoved in the pepper hole ?
how &apos;d it get in there ?
how did salt get shoved into this tiny , tiny pepper hole ?
nick ?
you &apos;re terrible at demonstrations !

yeah , ted . get crazy .
leave it all out there on the field .
okay .
i &apos;ll come back with stories .

because i &apos;m always gonna be one step ahead of you .
extreme biden !
kat . kat , kat ... let me out .
this was a huge mistake .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m not proud of this .
it smells so bad in here .
jess ?
jess , th @-@ this is the men &apos;s room .
this is where it all happens .
don &apos;t wait for me , ted , &apos; cause i might be awhile .
see you out on the dance floor .
and at wedding 12,
i sat on a men &apos;s toilet .
when did one @-@ on @-@ one sex become old @-@ fashioned ?
you know , america &apos;s got to take
a hard look in the mirror at ourself .
we used to make things .
just be glad you &apos;re not single .
actually buster and i broke up .
so , anyway ...
oh ... no !
no !
that is so terrible !
didn &apos;t know you cared this much .
no , no , no , no ...
if you &apos;re single ...
that means that i have to do something .
something awful .
you have no idea what you just did to me .
you have no idea , young lady !
i &apos;ll do the four @-@ way with you .
yes ! okay , i &apos;m gonna go book the room .
you go to housekeeping , have them give you
as many shower caps as they &apos;ll give you ...
okay , stop .
they &apos;re gonna get one hand and i &apos;m not gonna move it .
i &apos;m just gonna dangle it into the mix
while i look at something else on my phone .
and that &apos;s the deal .
aw , man , this is gonna be big for us .
this is for you , buddy .
thanks .
what the hell is that ?
what are you talking about ?
yeah , what &apos;s @-@ what &apos;s that on your hand , man ?

there &apos;s nothing on my hand . this is a regular old hand ...
i &apos;m out , i &apos;m out .
you &apos;re out of what ?
four @-@ way . done . no way .
not with that thing .
you &apos;re a buffoon .
that is ridiculous .
i was only doing it for you , schmidt ,
so you don &apos;t freak out when you find out
that cece &apos;s single .
and now i &apos;m the weirdo with the hoof hand .
what ... take it back from the hoof hand .
what &apos;d you say before ? about cece being single ?
how do you know that ?
she &apos;s single ?
i have my , uh ...
assumptions .
so cece &apos;s single now .
you don &apos;t know that for sure .
that &apos;s interesting .
why are you so calm ?
interesting .
don &apos;t just say &quot; interesting . &quot;
that &apos;s interesting .
if you &apos;re gonna say &quot; interesting &quot; say why
it &apos;s interesting .
it is interesting .
nick !
what are you doing here ?
what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s the men &apos;s room !
jess , scooch over .
all right .
what are you doing ? just hiding in the bathroom ?
kind of .
me , too .
i know i &apos;m supposed to , like ,
&quot; get back out there , &quot;
you know ? but ...
maybe i &apos;m just not built for it .
man , i hear you .
what do my hands feel like ?
hooves .
aw , son of a ...
maybe there &apos;s a reason
i &apos;m not up on a fridge , you know ?
maybe some people are fridge people ,
and other people are ...
toilet people .
you think you &apos;re a toilet person ?
you &apos;re not a toilet person .
you want to get on the fridge ,
you &apos;ll get on the fridge , jess .
just be yourself ,
and if he &apos;s not into jessica day ,
then there &apos;s something wrong with him .
be myself .
like do my tina turner impression ?
how did your brain jump there ?
* what &apos;s love got to do *
* got to do with it *
all right .
i hear your logic .
come on .
no man wants that ,
but ... you can &apos;t quit , either .
you &apos;re our last hope .
you &apos;re the only one out of the group
who might not go home alone tonight , jess .
really ?
yes .
it &apos;s all on your shoulders .
so the sex fist ...
has ...
turned into a sex finger .
uh , don &apos;t ... yeah .
sex finger .
hey . ted .
i &apos;m out of moves , so ...
i &apos;m just gonna try being myself .
here &apos;s some stuff about me :
i &apos;ve never cured anything .
i &apos;m a middle school vice principal
and i love my job .
um , i &apos;m just getting out of a relationship
with a guy that i still live with ,
which is kind of complicated .
he &apos;s over there .
what &apos;s up , nick ?
hi , i &apos;m nick !
sometimes i cry when newscasters
wish each other &quot; happy birthday &quot; on air .
my first crush was on a batman cake ,
but my first sexual feelings were about teenage simba .
&apos;cause he was super hot ,
and i still , actually , find him hot .
uh , truth time .
so that &apos;s me .
and if you want to take me home , ted ,
we can definitely do some no @-@ bra stuff .
that &apos;s me naked .
well ... and this is me with a guy who i thought was larry king .
so it &apos;s decision time .
yeah , ted , who &apos;s it gonna be ?
me or jess ?
this is tough .
i mean , okay , &apos; cause i mean , over here we &apos;ve got ,
you know , the whole ... you know .
and then , but of course over here we got the ... bing ,
and the ... you know .
oh , god , what do i do ?
what do i do ?
it &apos;s over .
moment &apos;s passed , ted .
okay .
i &apos;ll take him out .
so you and buster broke up .
whew . i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , i &apos;m just waiting for you to do something weird now .
yeah , i feel that coming on , so , um ...
i &apos;m gonna go .
you know what doesn &apos;t whine and cry
is the sperm in my freezer .
i am counting down the days
until we don &apos;t need men to procreate .
if i really put my mind to it ...
autumn 2018 .
are you ready ?
oh , it &apos;s my plan &quot; b. &quot;
yeah . beats going home alone .
just giving her a ride .
nothing weird .
we do this every time .
so , katherine , uh ... where do you live ?
about two inches north of your mouth , padre .
bye .
bye .
it &apos;s okay , jess .
sex fist is obviously over .
we &apos;re all going home alone .
well , that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong , schmidt .
we &apos;re not going home alone .
that &apos;s great .
all right .
it &apos;s like that .
&quot; regan , kevin and rebecca ... &quot;
... &quot; request the honor of your presence . &quot;
how about the honor of my garbage can ?
those fridge people with their stupid houses ...
oh , look at this one , guys .
