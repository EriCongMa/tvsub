This is really hard because I still love you.
If you're ever not feeling this,
then just be honest with me.
'Cause I'd rather be hurt than surprised.
I'm not really sure I'm into guys.
I mean, I've never even kissed a girl, so how would I know?
Arbiter is responsible for the death of Jack.
And I've just learned that Justina Marks works for Arbiter.
Do you realize what you've just done?
I don't care.
You will.
Is it true you made these false allegations
because she found out you were having sex
with your foster brother?
We're gonna fight this.
I can't sue her.
We absolutely can.
We can't because it's true.
Oh, my god.
Please tell me that I am misunderstanding this, Callie.
When did this happen?
Idyllwild.
It was only once. I thought I couldn't get adopted.
Why would you...
Honey, honey, just...
I know that there were complications, Callie,
But why wouldn't you think you were getting adopted?
Um, remember when Rita was accused of hitting Carmen?
Well, I got her to admit that she was lying
and I recorded it.
When I told her I wasn't going to let her get away with it,
she told me that if I ruined her life that she would ruin mine.
Okay, so wait, what does this have to do
with you getting adopted?
Carmen knew that I was seeing Brandon
while I was at GU.
Wait, after the restraining order?
So when I thought that Rita was going to lose her license
and her career and everything,
I sent her the recording of what Carmen had said,
我需要和你谈谈
and I figured that
that meant Carmen was going to blow up my adoption
by telling my social workers everything Brandon and I had done,
and I figured if for whatever reason she didn't,
that for sure...
Rita would.
Wait a minute, Rita knew?
Don't get mad at Rita. She thought everything was over.
Yeah, like we did.
She just wanted me to have a family.
So what are the different types of potential energy?
Mat?
Um, there's chemical, gravitational, mechanical,
and, um...
There's one more.
Nuclear.
Nice of you to join us, Mr. Stratos.
And what's an everyday example of potential energy at work?
I'll give you a hint... it was covered in the chapter.
Anyone know the answer?
Is it true Jude kissed you?
Who said that?
Well, I mean, he did it at your locker,
so, like, everyone saw it.
So what if he did?
Isn't he gay?
It really isn't any of your business, Daria.
What about Connor?
What about Connor?
He lives in LA.
Are you okay?
No, I'm not. I'm very much not okay.
Yeah, well, I got that.
Is there anything I can do?
Are you back together with Lexi?
No. I mean, we talked about it, but, you know...
Good.
You want to have sex?
Mariana?
Hey, uh, is Nick okay?
Is he here? I texted him, but he hasn't answered me.
Well, he was late during first period and he seemed kind of off.
Like, really off.
I gotta run.
Don't... don't do that.
All right, I'm sorry, man.
I'm just messing with you, jeez.
Yeah.
I... I think Mariana is looking for you.
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I'm looking for her too.
Uh, hey, are you... are you sick or something?
No, why?
Just checking.
You're a good friend.
Oh, yeah? Thanks, man.
How would you like to do your good friend a little favor?
Why didn't you tell us?
I didn't want to destroy the family.
As soon as we found out that I could get adopted,
we stopped everything right away.
We haven't done anything since.
We are family now.
That's the only reason you let us go through with it?
Because you didn't want to destroy the family, Callie?
No. No, of course not.
I love you both and I want you to be my moms.
I can't believe this was going on
all this time right under our noses.
How did we not know this was happening?
Stef.
It's not the time. It's not the time.
We love you too, Callie.
It's... it's just a lot to wrap our heads around.
If we had told you, what would you have done?
Hey, you got a sec?
Mike, what are you doing here?
Is Nick Stratos in school today?
Uh... I don't...
Let me check.
Why? Is everything okay?
Uh, there was a fire at his dad's warehouse.
What?
He's not in class.
What happened?
Looks like arson.
Are you okay? You don't look so good.
Are you feeling okay?
Look, um, I'm so, so sorry
that you saw Mat and me in the garage.
I know what you're thinking,
but I swear, that's not what's going on.
I'm gonna tell you everything, okay?
Everything.
Okay.
Mat wrote me a note
telling me that he still loved me.
At least, that's what he says. I never got it.
I think Zoey must have
taken it out of my bag at rehearsal or something.
Anyway, he told me about it
and he asked me to get back together with him.
But... I told him no.
No, I did.
Because I'm with you now and I really like you.
And what you saw in the garage,
that was just us saying goodbye. I swear.
That's not what it looked like.
I know.
But that's the truth. Honest to god.
Yeah, sure. Sure it is. You know what?
You're just telling me all this
because you guys want to use the warehouse for your show.
No, that's not... I don't even care about the stupid show.
You said... you said you weren't going to surprise me.
I know. I know, and I'm sorry. But that's not...
Hey, shouldn't you two be in class?
Oh, um... I'm sorry. We were just...
Yeah, I can see that. Let's go.
Can't we just have...
No.
Let's go now.
Okay, wait, so you think Nick did it?
Well, we'd like to talk to him about it.
Wait.
Yes? Okay. No, I'll be right there.
Apparently, Mr. Stratos is here,
demanding to speak to us.
Mr. Stratos? Want to come on in?
Mike was just telling us about your warehouse.
That's awful. I'm so sorry.
Oh, you're gonna be when I sue you.
Uh, why... why would you sue us?
I never gave permission for the school to use it
to put on that play. So you're liable.
Yes, you did. We spoke on the phone.
I spoke with someone on the phone. Nick connected us.
Wasn't me, 'cause I didn't speak with anyone.
Now get Nick in here. I want to talk to him.
He's not here. He didn't come to school today.
Then what's his car doing here? It's right out front.
What's going on?
Nothing, love. What do you need?
I wanted to talk to Mama.
About what?
I saw Nick and he was...
you saw Nick?
Here at school?
He seemed really weird.
Okay, come with me.
Callie, would you go back to class? We'll talk later.
看"寄养发现"了吗 很多人在说你和布兰登的坏话
Well, I just saw Nick and he seemed super weird.
So I take it you're the girl...
the one who's been messing with my son.
Mariana, this is Nick's father,
Mr. Stratos.
Oh, hi.
What do you mean, "super weird"?
Um, well, he was just...
It's important you tell us everything that happened.
Okay. Well, Nick was upset
because he thought that Mat and I were getting back together.
We're not, but he didn't want to believe me.
Oh, come on.
You have been playing my son and he finally figured it out.
Okay... okay.
Of course he's upset.
No, it... it was more than that.
He... he seemed off.
Off in what way, Mariana?
I don't know, why?
What happened? Did Nick do something?
N-not that we know of, but there was a fire at the warehouse...
And we just... we don't...
You think Nick did it?
Hey, I just confirmed, he's not in class and no one's seen him.
Then where the hell is he?
I swear to god, you people are incompetent.
Why don't we go and see if Nick's car is here, shall we?
His car was right there!
So the kids just come and go as they please?
Mariana, why don't you go back to class, okay?
Uh, Mr. Stratos, d-do you think...
do you think that Nick would, uh, hurt himself or anyone else?
What are you asking me?
Does he have access to any weapons?
Weapons?
Do you keep a gun in the house?
I have a gun.
Yes. I have a carry permit.
But I keep it locked in the car.
Okay, do you think that we could check it
and make sure that it's still there?
We don't need to.
Humor me.
There's no point in...
So let's give Nick a call again, find out where he is.
Get down... everybody down. Stop the car now!
Turn off the engine!
Come out with your hands in the air!
Whoa! This is a little bit over the top for cutting a class.
Okay. What are you doing in Nick's car?
I... I just borrowed it so I could take Emma out.
In the middle of the school day? Nice, Jesus!
So Nick is here? Nick's on campus?
Look, it's not his fault.
I'm the one who asked him to borrow the car.
Nick's got a gun. As far as we know, he is here.
Yeah.
We've got to lockdown this school now.
Let's get everyone in the office.
Are you serious?
I'll call it in!
Stef, where are you going?
I'm going to find our daughter!
You okay?
Um, no, I need to tell you something.
What?
Moms know.
Know what?
What we did in Idyllwild.
How?
I told them.
Code blue.
This is a code blue. This is not a drill.
I repeat...
You two get into a classroom, right now!
Come on, drop your bag. Get into a classroom, please.
Out of the hallway, everybody!
This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill.
Mom? Mom, what's going on?
It's okay. Just go ahead
and get into your classroom right now, sweetheart. All right.
Do you know where your sister is... Mariana?
No, no, no.
Okay, honey.
Mom?
Yeah, love?
I love you.
I love you too, sweetheart. Just get in your class.
I repeat, this is not a drill.
This is a code blue. Code blue.
Code blue, this is a code blue. This is not a drill.
I repeat, this is not a drill.
What does "code blue" mean?
It means someone has a gun on campus.
Maybe if I'm lucky, I'll get shot
so I don't have to see moms.
Brandon, what a stupid thing to say.
Code blue, this is a code blue.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah... I-I'm fine.
I'm just a sub, so I've never been through anything like this.
Get those blinds, okay?
Everyone, we have to stay quiet and do what I say.
I need this table in front of this door right now.
Stack the stools on the table.
Okay, let's do it.
Get on here.
Now everyone down against the wall, okay?
And remember, you have to be totally quiet. All right?
Code blue. This is a code blue.
You okay?
I repeat, this is not a drill.
This is a code blue. Code blue.
Code blue. This is a code blue.
This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill.
This is a code blue. Code blue.
Code blue. This is a code blue.
This is not a drill.
We are on lockdown. Get out of here, run!
Go as far away from the school as possible. Don't come back.
Go, go, go.
Code blue. This is a code blue.
This is not a drill.
This is the final announcement you will hear over the P.A.
Wait, we don't open the door for anyone.
Let me in, please.
It's Mariana... Mariana Foster.
Mariana. We have to let her in.
Absolutely not! We don't know who else is out there.
She could be with the shooter.
She could be the shooter. Sit down.
Open the door, please.
Give me this.
Open the door, please!
Please, let me in.
Please open the door! I'm stuck out here in the hallway!
Open the door!
Open the door, please!
Please let me in!
Okay, they've called in SWAT.
They should be in within five minutes.
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Yes?
Excuse me, I got one of those calls...
A robocall saying the school is going on lockdown?
Yes, that's right.
What is going on?
Um, listen, there is no need to panic,
but we have reason to believe that there might be someone
on campus with a gun.
Wait, wait. Wait, excuse me. I want to take my son home now.
I understand, but that's not possible.
The best thing for you and for your son
is for you to go to the designated meeting area and wait there.
I am not leaving here without my son.
Listen, I know this is scary.
It's scary.
It is. My kids are in there too.
We have a job to do and
it is not safe for you to be here right now.
Officer Johnston, please.
He's going to escort you to the meeting area.
And please wait.
But we have to...
It's going to be fine.
talk to our kids and...
It's going to be fine, I promise you.
Thank you for your cooperation.
It will be fine.
This is ridiculous.
Everything is going to be okay.
All right? I promise you.
You're good. I got you.
You're okay.
I'm going to be right back, okay?
Okay. Good girl.
Why are they asking about Nick?
The warehouse burned down.
What?
With all the sets and everything.
I heard when I was in the office.
I'm really sorry.
Maybe they think Nick's, like, lost it or something.
I never found Mariana. I assume she got back to her class.
Are all the kids accounted for?
Uh, not yet.
But we haven't gotten roll call back from all the classes yet.
We have Emma and Jesus here, of course.
And Jude is in his class.
But we still haven't heard anything back
about Mariana, Callie, or Brandon.
What is taking so long?
Well, we have a sub in one class,
so it might just take a little longer.
Don't worry.
What? What?
Sorry. Sorry, I just...
This is what happens when I get nervous.
Emma, come on. 'Kay? Take a deep breath.
It's okay. We're going to be fine.
I just can't believe this is all because of Nick.
Did he seem upset
when you saw him this morning?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess he was kind of acting strange.
He thanked me for being a good friend.
Well, you are a good friend.
But it wasn't like that.
The way he was talking,
it was more heavy.
Like he was going away for a long time.
Or like...
Like he was going to do something to himself?
Hey, buddy, it's your dad. Please call me.
Don't do anything stupid.
Please.
We should get roll done.
Here.
Miranda Collins?
Abby Wheeler?
Dean Kudrow?
Leo James?
Matthew Johnson?
Stephen Evans?
你在吗
Hey, turn that off.
You're gonna get us killed.
What are you doing?
Whenever I get scared or whatever,
I do the sign of the cross on my hand.
It makes me feel better,
like I'm talking to god, or...
I know, it's dumb.
No. I don't think so.
Just like that.
So... You and Robby?
Yeah, me and Robby.
We're talking about the same guy here, right?
Wrestling Robby, not...
Yeah, him.
With the... the hairy arms?
Yeah.
Ugh, they were so hairy.
When he would put his arms around me, he would tickle my ears.
How long were you guys together?
Couple months.
I think you're better off anyway.
I didn't see you guys together.
Apparently, he didn't either.
Yeah, well, you deserve a lot more
than some knucklehead who cheats on you.
Okay, we got the last roll from the sub's room.
And it looks like Brandon and Callie are in there.
Wait, I thought the sub was doing junior high?
Yeah, they must've gotten pulled in during the lockdown.
Thank god. Looks like they're the ones
taking the roll and sending the emails.
Let me see.
Okay.
凯丽 布兰登 你们还好吧
发生什么事情了 一切都还好吗
Wait... wait a minute.
This can't be the last class. Mariana's not here.
No one... no one has Mariana.
Okay, okay, I'm sure she's fine.
You know, we probably just missed her name somewhere.
You don't think she's with Nick, do you?
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Mama... mama, where is she?
I don't know, I don't know.
Shh, keep your voice down.
Lena? Lena! Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
I'm going to find Mariana.
Get down, get down.
Mike, if she is not in a classroom,
that means she's in this building somewhere alone!
I'm gonna go find her. Let me go.
Listen to me, I know you're scared.
Get off of me!
I know you're scared. But nobody's going out there
to be target practice for somebody with a gun.
I know it's not what you want to hear right now,
but you are not leaving this room.
Maybe she's hiding out somewhere.
Unless she's with Nick?
Stef, we have all of the kids
except Mariana.
Move that perimeter back!
What the hell is taking so long?
I mean, seriously, why aren't they telling us anything?
Quiet.
You know what?
We're all just... we're just sitting ducks.
Shut up. Okay? You're scaring them.
You guys? There's something wrong with Stasia.
Hey, what's going on?
Can you talk?
I have...
She... she has diabetes.
This... this happened one time
and the teacher gave her sugar, I think.
Okay, then we need sugar. Does anyone have anything sweet?
Guys? Sugar. We need sugar. Nothing?
Go, go, go! All right, let's go, let's go! Move, move!
If Nick's inside, he's hiding.
So we've got to get everyone out
and do a clean sweep with dogs.
We've got a secure area for the students.
We're going to start quietly evacuating,
one classroom at a time.
We've got the master key to unlock and get everyone out.
Just wanted to let you know.
Sit tight and we'll get to you soon, okay?
Any word on Mariana?
No.
It's going to be okay. We're going to find her.
I love you.
I love you too.
Nothing? We need sugar, guys. Anything sweet.
What do we do?
I don't... I don't know.
Nobody's got candy or...
Brandon, look in here.
I think there's a...
I think that there's, like, an emergency bag somewhere.
What, an emerg... what does it look like?
Yeah, you know, like a backpack or something.
I found it! I got... I got it.
Give me that.
I got it.
Okay.
We should hurry up.
Hold on.
Okay. Okay, I got you.
He's just doing this 'cause he wants attention.
What are you talking about?
He's not straight.
Well, you're not.
You don't know what you're talking about, Daria.
Yeah, why are you being such a douche?
Well, excuse me if I don't want my friend to get hurt.
Hands on your head. Everyone against the wall.
We're coming in.
It's all right, it's all right.
It's okay, it's okay.
All right, let's move. Come on, kids. Let's go.
Go, go, go.
Go, go.
Keep moving.
Go, go, go.
All right, let's go. Come on.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You okay?
Yeah, go.
Why?
I just couldn't lie anymore, Brandon.
I just needed it to be over.
Well, it is.
I'm sorry.
Don't apologize.
Not to me.
Back, back.
All right, let's go.
Get out of the school.
Hey, did you find Mariana yet?
Just go to the holding area.
We'll come get you as soon as we can.
Okay?
Okay, I love you.
I love you too.
Where is she?
Why can't they find her?
It's okay.
I'm not going back there.
Lena...
Why can't they find...
Get down, please.
Why can't they find her?
Why can't they find her?
Come on, clear.
This way!
Get down, get down, get down!
Down! Shh! Shh!
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Stef! Stef! Stef!
Foster!
Stef!
Foster!
Stef! No!
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?
Whoa! The teacher! The teacher has the gun!
It's the teacher!
On the ground!
Okay, okay!
Sorry!
Everybody else, stand up,
put your hands behind your head!
Bring a gun to school? What the hell is wrong with you?
You almost got yourself killed!
Are you okay?
Some idiot teacher brought a gun to school.
Okay. You guys are okay?
You're Foster, right?
Yes.
Come with me.
Okay.
You're with them. It's okay now, all right?
All right, everybody, single file...
keep your hands on your head, out this way.
Keep going!
All the way out.
You're gonna follow him all the way to the yellow tape.
It's okay.
我在 怎么了
Hey, um, forget about Daria.
She's an idiot.
Thanks.
And thanks for being so cool
when I was kind of freaking out.
So, listen.
Yeah?
Today has been kind of intense, you know?
And we had a lot of fun.
And then, you know, thank you so much
for being so sweet about dumb-ass Robby and all that.
But...
But what?
I just... I don't want you to think that we're, like,
starting something up again.
Uh... yeah, no.
No, uh, I... yeah, no, I didn't. Yeah, no.
Okay. Good.
Yeah. Yeah, good.
Yeah.
Cool.
So we've swept the entire school.
No sign of the Stratos kid anywhere.
We've got an APB out for him, but for now, anyway,
everyone should go home.
All right, thank you.
Thank you.
Where the hell is he?
Why don't... why don't you guys
just hang out for a second, okay?
I'll do a sweep of the house.
Just be extra careful till we know where Nick is.
All right?
I'm sorry.
Okay, it's clear, guys.
Clear.
