what must i do to enact this curse ?
you need to sacrifice the heart of the thing you love most .
i &apos;m sorry .
this isn &apos;t fair to killian .
gold tricked him . i &apos;m getting him back .
you &apos;re going to hell ?
the underworld .
hook , i will find you .
i will always find you .
hey , emma .
neal ?
yeah .
it &apos;s really great to see you .
where are we ? am i dreaming ?
no .
if this were a dream , there &apos;d be , like ,
talking doughnuts or something weird like that .
think of this as a long @-@ distance call from an old friend .
it &apos;s really you .
how &apos;s our son ?
great . he ...
misses his dad .
he &apos;s growing up .
i bet .
is this the underworld ?
i was on my way to the underworld .
yeah , i know that &apos;s where you &apos;re headed .
that &apos;s kind of why i &apos;m here .
don &apos;t go , emma .
once you get there , it is not an easy place to get out of .
i know you &apos;re trying to save hook .
but trust me on this .
this won &apos;t end the way you think it will .
i would have come after you , too .
i didn &apos;t know i could do this .
you couldn &apos;t have .
i &apos;m not there . i &apos;m not in limbo .
does that mean ...
that hook is there ?
i can get him ?
yeah , he &apos;s there .
then help me .
i can split my heart and give it to him .
it could work .
the underworld &apos;s for people with unfinished business ,
and that isn &apos;t me .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m not there .
where are you ?
someplace .
someplace where i &apos;m happy .
i only came here because i care about you , emma .
stop what you &apos;re doing before it &apos;s too late .
i can &apos;t .
i figured .
but i had to try .
neal .
i love you , emma .
i always have , and i always will .
neal ?
emma .
are you okay ?
yeah , you passed out .
yeah . i &apos;m fine .
good . because we &apos;re here .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re in maine anymore .
how is this possible ?
how does the underworld look like storybrooke ?
your questions are pointless .
all that matters is , all these people in this underworld
are dead and trapped
because they have unfinished business .
cruella .
that &apos;s right .
and she &apos;s here because of you .
and i imagine there are many here because of all of us .
let &apos;s not lollygag .
split up . we &apos;ll cover more ground .
agreed .
the sooner we get out of here , the better .
greetings , my subjects .
your majesty .
happy birthday , my queen .
blueberry .
not bad .
but i prefer apple .
luckily for you , i &apos;m not here for the pie .
the present i want , none of you have .
but you will get it for me --
snow white &apos;s heart on a plate .
i know she &apos;s been here .
and if someone doesn &apos;t start talking ...
wait .
i think i can help you .
i can tell you where snow white is .
then tell me .
i want something in return .
how &apos;s this for a deal ?
tell me , and i &apos;ll kill you quickly
instead of slowly .
tell me where that wretched girl is .
behind you .
i &apos;m right here , regina , and i won &apos;t let you hurt anyone else .
i wouldn &apos;t do that if i were you .
we &apos;ve got you surrounded .
so , what do you say ?
shall we end this ridiculous conflict ?
you &apos;re lucky it &apos;s my birthday
and i &apos;m feeling benevolent .
is this really the way you want to spend today ?
perhaps it &apos;s time for a change .
perhaps it &apos;s time to
give up on revenge and move on .
i will never give up .
not until snow white &apos;s heart
is in one of these boxes .
i know you loved daniel ,
but if anyone is to blame , it &apos;s your mother .
she ripped out his heart
so you would become the merciless queen
that she always wanted .
don &apos;t let her win .
don &apos;t let her control you .
mother does not control me .
i banished her to wonderland , remember ?
until you give up this quest for vengeance ,
cora will always have a hold on you .
your majesty .
she &apos;s here .
thank you for bringing me this information .
now tell me -- how &apos;s my daughter ?
is that -- i know you .
aren &apos;t you snow white ?
can you imagine ?
uh , well , what can i get you ?
do you like gingerbread or children ?
kidding .
but the -- the gingerbread &apos;s actually not bad .
i &apos;m looking for a friend .
he would have gotten here recently .
uh , dark hair , a hook for a hand .
captain hook .
you know him ?
no , no .
but your description &apos;s pretty complete .
david .
you changed . what happened ? is everything okay ?
everything &apos;s fine .
good , because i &apos;m not .
this place is creeping me out .
i see why my brother likes you .
james .
indeed .
so , snow white &apos;s in town .
i &apos;m guessing that means my brother is , too .
all right .
when you see ol &apos; dave ,
tell him there &apos;s a new sheriff in town .
was that ... my brother ?
yeah .
mom . dad .
you find anything ?
there &apos;s no sign of him at the park or the town hall .
this is hopeless .
we don &apos;t even know if hook &apos;s here .
what if he has no unfinished business ?
he died a dark one , miss swan .
trust me , he &apos;s here .
look , i &apos;m finished being a team player .
if you want things done , let me do them my way .
i may have something down here that can help us .
henry .
no luck yet , mom ?
not yet .
what &apos;s that ?
i was just checking the rooms .
room eight .
that was your dad &apos;s .
you &apos;re looking for him ?
i wanted to let him know i was okay .
he knows , kid . he knows .
how can you be sure ?
i just am .
he &apos;s in a better place , i promise .
it &apos;s uncanny .
it &apos;s so similar , yet so ... off .
well , when i conjured storybrooke ,
it was with the dark curse .
whoever created that curse ,
looks like this is where they got their inspiration .
or vice versa .
what is it ? what &apos;s wrong ?
you .
you &apos;ve been following us .
why ?
someone wants to see you .
i hate her pasty complexion ...
her insufferable sincerity ...
and her puny army of sweaty little child @-@ beasts .
i believe they &apos;re dwarfs .
i don &apos;t care what they are . they &apos;re disgusting .
and i asked to be alone , daddy .
so if you &apos;ve come here to talk about mother again ,
i &apos;m not interested .
i just want this birthday to be over .
mirror , mirror on the wall ,
we must do something about my daughter .
how can i be of service ?
i need you to summon ...
... her .
i &apos;m sorry . no .
i don &apos;t have a death wish .
if you care for my daughter at all , you will do what i ask .
as you wish .
hello , henry .
cora , are aware of what day it is ?
of course . i &apos;m well aware it &apos;s our daughter &apos;s birthday .
let me guess -- she &apos;s wasting it
tormenting herself over snow white .
you have to talk to her .
she listens to you .
tell her to let go of this feud .
she doesn &apos;t need to let it go .
she needs to finish it .
if regina won &apos;t be happy
until she crushes snow white &apos;s heart ,
then we must help her do just that .
this was a terrible idea .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
to talk to snow white .
goodbye , cora .
i don &apos;t need your help .
no .
but regina does .
mother .
you &apos;re here .
yes .
i had hoped you were okay .
i know , darling .
i know .
but i do have unfinished business .
and that would be you .
you don &apos;t have to worry about me .
i &apos;ll always worry about you .
i want you to be happy .
then help me find hook and get out of here .
it &apos;s too dangerous .
you need to leave -- now .
i promised my friends i would help .
your friends .
your family .
they &apos;re what &apos;s holding you back .
sweetheart , you must do what &apos;s best for you .
i am .
no , you &apos;re not .
and if you won &apos;t , i &apos;ll see to it that you do .
it wasn &apos;t easy ,
but i &apos;ve arranged for a boat to take you home .
it departs in one hour .
take henry , take your thief ,
and go before it &apos;s too late .
mother ...
i can &apos;t .
you must .
i know it &apos;s hard to -- to put aside all suspicion
after how i raised you , but , regina ...
do you remember the last thing i said to you
before i died ?
that i would have been enough .
you would have been .
it just took me too long to realize it .
don &apos;t make the same mistake .
go .
what would happened if i stayed ?
sometimes a mother has to do what &apos;s best for her child ,
even if it &apos;s reprehensible .
are you threatening me ?
oh , no .
no , of course not . i never .
but there &apos;s something i have to show you .
mother ...
where are we ?
what are you doing ?
showing you your fate if you don &apos;t return to storybrooke .
you ...
you killed him .
&quot; killed &quot; is , um , a relative term down here .
this underworld ...
most can only leave it in two ways --
to a better place or a worse one .
but you , my sweet daughter , have another option .
however , not for long .
go home , or there will be a cost .
someone will suffer .
who ?
your father .
the underworld ?
i &apos;ll only be gone for a day .
just long enough to retrieve hook .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand . why you ?
because , belle , i &apos;m the only who &apos;s been there .
plus , my blood can summon the ferry .
just come back to me .
i always do .
looking for something ?
peter pan .
i certainly wasn &apos;t looking for you .
oh , come on , son . don &apos;t be like that .
aren &apos;t you glad to see your dear old father ?
just because you , uh , sired me ,
that doesn &apos;t make you my father .
step aside .
keep looking for as long as you like .
but down here , this is my shop .
and you won &apos;t find anything unless i want you to .
be careful with your threats .
or what ? you &apos;ll kill me again ?
maybe it &apos;s time to put the past behind us .
this is what you &apos;re looking for , right ?
go on .
take it .
how generous .
how many strings are attached ?
no strings .
rumple , i meant what i said before i died .
i -- i do want to start over .
never gonna happen .
i sent you here for a reason .
i miss the world above -- the tastes , the smells .
sorry .
you can &apos;t go back .
not unless i trade places with a living soul .
and those people you came down with ...
they are not your friends .
and they are living ...
for now .
maybe one of them doesn &apos;t make the trip back ,
but your dear old dad does .
not interested .
not yet .
but ...
this one &apos;s on the house for today .
a gesture of goodwill ...
from a father to his son .
she &apos;ll really do that ?
she &apos;ll throw your father , her husband , into the fire ?
of course she will .
she thinks she &apos;s giving me my best chance .
i can &apos;t let my father suffer because of me .
regina , it &apos;s all right .
no , it &apos;s not .
he &apos;s here because i killed him .
the only way i &apos;ve been able to deal with that
is by imaging he went to a better place , but ...
he didn &apos;t .
maybe i should get on that boat .
yes , you should .
absolutely not .
we &apos;re not leaving until we find hook together .
it &apos;s dangerous here .
which is why we &apos;re not leaving you alone .
perhaps i can cut through this little family squabble .
what the hell is that ?
this is the way to find your deceased pirate .
the ale of seonaidh from the land of dunbroch .
that &apos;s a mouthful .
it lets you communicate with the dead .
pour this over hook &apos;s grave ,
and we can stop guessing where he is and simply ask him .
you &apos;re saying hook has a grave here in the underworld ?
everyone down here has a grave .
you &apos;ll find the cemetery right where you remember it .
well , if this works , we could find hook before the boat leaves .
we could all get out of here together .
a fine idea . i suggest you all get moving .
no way .
you &apos;re coming with us .
you can do this part on your own .
there &apos;s a boat that &apos;s leaving soon .
you want to find hook ? fine .
but i have no interest in exploring this world further .
you can meet me there .
but that &apos;s entirely up to you .
emma .
there &apos;s no time to argue .
if there &apos;s even a chance that will work ,
we have to risk it .
i got your message .
are you alone ?
alone and unarmed , as promised .
well , i &apos;m alone , but i don &apos;t go anywhere unarmed .
sorry .
i &apos;m here because i care about my daughter .
and if the war continues , it will destroy the kingdom ,
but more importantly , her soul .
snow white .
you see ?
the only way to truly achieve peace
is through war .
cora .
how -- how are you here ?
why , because of you , henry dear .
you played with magic you didn &apos;t understand .
and i never let a good mistake go to waste .
please , i beg you .
don &apos;t do this .
now ...
forget this ever happened
and go enjoy your last few hours .
come along , henry .
regina needs her birthday present .
all right .
let &apos;s do this .
you okay ?
i just hope he is .
killian .
killian , we &apos;re here to help you .
we just can &apos;t find you . where are you ?
emma ...
the spell &apos;s not steady . he can &apos;t hear you .
just tell us where you are .
something &apos;s happening .
it &apos;s not holding .
talk to us .
talk to me .
killian !
he doesn &apos;t know we came for him .
we -- he doesn &apos;t know we &apos;re here .
he doesn &apos;t know that i care .
yes , he does . and , emma , we will find him .
will we ?
did you not just see that ?
he &apos;s in pain . he &apos;s suffering .
and look at this place .
we have half an hour .
you have half an hour .
cora has a boat coming .
you have to take it , or we might all be stuck here .
if she can arrange a way out , so can we --
after we find hook .
we are not giving up on you .
regina .
they &apos;re staying , but you should go .
no . i @-@ i ...
take robin and henry ...
because if you don &apos;t ,
whatever your father is going to face --
it probably looks a lot like what ...
hook is facing .
so , it &apos;s settled .
get them out of here .
get yourself out of here .
make a wish ! make a wish !
what did you wish ?
that you were amusing , jester .
and it didn &apos;t come true .
let &apos;s wind this up .
i &apos;ve had enough revelry .
oh , don &apos;t go yet .
mother .
how did you get out of wonderland ?
where &apos;s daddy ?
did you do something ?
oh , i lost track of him hours ago
when i had him wrap ...
this .
happy birthday , darling .
i don &apos;t want anything from you .
oh , you &apos;ll want this .
i did what no one else could do , regina .
i &apos;ve brought you your revenge .
snow white &apos;s beating heart .
really ?
crush it ,
and she dies at last .
you don &apos;t believe me .
let me show you .
bring the magic mirror .
show us snow white .
to my stepmother !
may she spend the rest of her birthdays searching for me .
to the queen !
to the queen !
to the queen !
snow .
someone switched the hearts .
who ?
you gave snow white her heart back .
i had to for your own good .
how could you say that ?
she &apos;d be dead right now , and all this would be over .
don &apos;t you want me to be happy ?
of course , but not like this .
if you crush her heart ,
you could be dark forever , regina .
you &apos;ll be just like her -- your mother .
that &apos;s what she wants .
please . please , regina .
please , you have to listen to me . you can be happy .
killing snow white
is the only way i will ever be happy .
i &apos;m sorry you think that .
you betrayed me , daddy .
and you know what that means .
do what you will , dear .
it matters not , because snow white lives .
and now so does your chance at redemption .
whatever happens to me was worth it .
this box is as empty as your pursuit .
i pray it stays that way .
it won &apos;t .
until snow white dies ,
i will never be what you want ...
let along what i want .
and this box
was made to hold something precious .
and that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s it &apos;s going to do .
don &apos;t worry , daddy .
you &apos;re safe in here .
i just can &apos;t let you stop me .
but i would never do anything to hurt you .
regina , please .
don &apos;t .
no !
regina .
daddy .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s okay , dear . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
is it ?
am i really forgiven ?
of course .
i love you no matter what .
that &apos;s what fathers do .
i &apos;m not sure they do .
i think you &apos;re very special .
i don &apos;t understand how you can be so good .
oh , i &apos;m not perfect .
i have many regrets .
i don &apos;t even know which one is keeping me in this place .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter .
your suffering will not get any worse .
i &apos;m going to see to it .
no , regina .
that &apos;s i came to tell you .
your mother is using me to get you to leave .
but i want you to stay .
you &apos;ve got a job to do --
helping snow white , your friends .
they need you . they need your strength .
you finally put vengeance aside to be a hero .
i &apos;m not gonna stand in the way of that .
but mother &apos;s going to send you someplace worse .
i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t cause you pain again .
mother made her decision .
we both know we can &apos;t change her mind .
but she &apos;s given you a way out .
both of us .
when you tore my heart out ,
it was driven by the worst motives .
but if you stay , you spread hope .
that &apos;s the best thing anyone can do .
let your old man see you doing the right thing .
then i truly will not have died in vain .
where &apos;s your father run off to ?
i still owe him a thank you
for spoiling your birthday surprise .
i &apos;ve already dealt with him .
say hello to daddy .
you &apos;ve impressed me , sweetheart .
you know ...
daddy may have been wrong to ruin my revenge ,
but he was right about you .
when are you going to get it in that thick head
that i do everything for you ?
especially the things you can &apos;t do ...
like snow &apos;s heart .
how long have you been trying to get it ?
because it only took me a day .
and it only took you an hour to lose it .
when i get my revenge , it will be my victory .
you won &apos;t be around to steal it away .
you don &apos;t have the power to push me back to wonderland .
i don &apos;t need it .
there &apos;s someone who &apos;d be happy to lend a hand .
hello again , cora .
ready for your trip ?
don &apos;t do this !
it &apos;s done .
i &apos;ve already cast a spell
to seal this portal once you &apos;re through .
not even i can reopen it .
and you &apos;ll be out of my life forever .
without me , you &apos;ll fail .
and even worse , you &apos;ll be alone .
better alone than with you .
you think you &apos;re better alone ?
let &apos;s see how you really feel .
no !
daddy !
you always have me .
let him go , mother .
you should be on that boat .
i can &apos;t turn my back on those i love .
i know that seems like the right choice ,
but life doesn &apos;t work that way .
i implore you , leave this place .
no , regina . stay here .
help your friends . she &apos;s trying to bait you .
i didn &apos;t come back just to help my friends .
i came back to help everyone .
that &apos;s not possible .
you have to trust me .
let him go .
oh , please listen to reason . listen to me .
either way , my time in the underworld is done .
yours can be , too .
just do what i say .
henry , stand back .
please don &apos;t force my hand . i don &apos;t want to do this .
then don &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
no !
one day , you &apos;ll understand .
daddy !
i &apos;m so sorry .
daddy ?
stop . stay there .
i &apos;m okay .
what &apos;s happening ?
i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s ...
something down here .
it &apos;s so ...
it &apos;s beautiful .
it &apos;s where i belong .
i know what my unfinished business was now .
it was you .
me ?
for so long , i let your mother
get in the way of who you really are .
it was the biggest regret of my life .
but now ...
you &apos;re free of her .
and i &apos;ve never been more proud .
hi .
is that ...
this is your grandson --
henry .
thank you , grandpa ...
for believing in her like i do .
thank you , henry ...
for being there when i couldn &apos;t .
you take good care of her .
it &apos;s time for me to go .
daddy , no .
i love you , regina .
never forget ...
who you really are .
okay .
tell me your father &apos;s okay .
he &apos;s better than okay .
he &apos;s in a better place now .
wait . that means everyone here ...
can be saved .
every soul in this town has unfinished business .
and chances are , for a lot of them , we &apos;re that business .
you &apos;ve all deluded yourself
if you think these people are worth your time .
they &apos;re not the dearly departed .
they are dead , wretched souls ,
and i want no part of it .
what you want doesn &apos;t matter .
i wasn &apos;t bluffing -- i &apos;m happy to tell belle
about your return to dark one @-@ ness .
our agreement was to find your pirate
and get the hell out of here .
if you want to distract yourself
with this other asinine pursuit ,
be my guest .
i &apos;m out .
so ...
who &apos;s ready for &quot; operation firebird &quot; ?
is that what we &apos;re calling it ?
you referring to the mythological bird
or the muscle car ?
did you hear that , cora ?
the music ?
yes .
but i &apos;ve never been very fond of the violin .
i wouldn &apos;t expect a miller &apos;s daughter
to appreciate a virtuoso like paganini ,
but , no , i didn &apos;t mean the music .
i was talking about the clock .
did you hear that little tick up there ?
it was the sound of your incompetence .
why do you want my daughter gone ?
what threat could she pose to you ?
ah . tick , tick , tick .
you see , each clock tick
means a soul has left my domain .
do i look like i like to lose anything ?
i did what you asked .
i didn &apos;t want to . i ...
i jeopardized my relationship with her .
yes , because you thought
you could get her to do what i wanted ,
which you couldn &apos;t .
if it makes you feel any better
she &apos;s going to regret her decision .
don &apos;t threaten her .
or me .
now ...
i want what i was promised .
ah . really , cora .
i &apos;m surprised you care so much about regina ...
especially after what you did to your other daughter .
how do you know about zelena ?
oh , i know about everything .
including why you gave her up .
all so you could claw your way out of a miserable peasant life .
which suggests the perfect punishment .
look at that .
a miller &apos;s daughter once again .
hurry now , cora .
you-- you have flour to deliver .
that &apos;s what they do at mills , isn &apos;t it ?
i never paid much attention .
it seems like such dull work .
no .
no , you ... promised you &apos;d save us .
just ...
and you promised not to fail .
something to think about for eternity .
