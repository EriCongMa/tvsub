第五集
daniel &apos;s grave . he died because of you .
i was very young , and your mother--
she ripped his heart out .
henry , you &apos;re gonna go home with david .
i want you to be here because you want to be here ,
not because of magic .
i want to redeem myself .
magic can set you free . let me guide you .
and i won &apos;t become like her ?
that , dearie , is entirely up to you .
it &apos;s not safe here . cora &apos;s still out there .
we found a safe haven . we must go there now .
hello , hook .
i don &apos;t know if i can do this .
i &apos;m not a very good liar .
oh , it &apos;s not really a lie , aurora .
lancelot did die an honorable death
and cora did escape .
all true .
just leave the particulars to us .
there &apos;s no reason to cause unnecessary panic
amongst your people .
i &apos;m not so sure it &apos;s unnecessary--
wait .
the tower . we always have sentries guarding the entrance .
stay close .
oh , my god .
this can &apos;t be .
our land--we were protected here , hidden .
how did the ogres find us ?
ogres didn &apos;t do this .
what ?
cora did . their hearts--
they were ripped out . this was her magic--twisted and evil .
we have to stop her .
too late .
she killed them . she killed them all .
no , we have to stop her before she hurts anyone else .
hey . look .
there &apos;s someone under there .
he &apos;s alive .
please .
it &apos;s okay .
please help me .
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re safe now . we won &apos;t hurt you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you very much for caring . see you .
you .
we need to talk .
what the hell was that for ?
sleeping with my wife .
kathryn ?
snow .
look , i didn &apos;t know . all right ? i was cursed .
yeah , i got it . what do you want ?
so ... is it true ?
people are saying that you &apos;re trying to find a way
to build a portal back to your land
because that &apos;s where you think emma and mary margaret are ,
that they &apos;re alive .
well , the whispers can stop .
i have no secrets from this town .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m doing .
but the land--it &apos;s--it &apos;s gone , destroyed by the curse .
apparently not .
well , you &apos;re having any luck ?
not yet .
we &apos;re working on it .
does that mean that all the lands still exist ?
possibly .
so the queen lied to us .
again .
are you sure ?
remember who we &apos;re talking about .
regina .
are you here to see me ?
i &apos;ve been trying to keep my promise to henry ,
but it &apos;s been difficult .
to not use magic .
it &apos;s been two days .
that &apos;s an excellent start .
come on in .
it &apos;s just that
magic is the way i &apos;ve always gotten everything .
sounds like it &apos;s also the way you &apos;ve lost everything .
regina , this is your chance to start over ,
to earn henry .
dr. whale , this is highly inappropriate .
send me back .
excuse me ?
to my land . send me back to my brother .
why don &apos;t you check the &quot; missing &quot; board
like everyone else ?
your curse only brought the living .
well , then i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
but i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t send anyone anywhere .
can &apos;t or won &apos;t ?
dr. whale , i have to insist . please .
go .
sorry .
what you said isn &apos;t entirely true , is it ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
about the curse only taking the living .
the grave of your father &apos;s here , right ?
i don &apos;t care about whale or his brother .
i brought who i wanted .
anyone else ?
if you want help , you have to try and trust me .
stopping magic is a lot harder than starting .
now show me what you &apos;ve learned .
immobilize it .
there . i did it .
excellent work , my apprentice .
now there &apos;s just one last , tiny , tiny , teeny , little detail .
take its heart .
like what my mother did to--
oh , to your true love . indeed .
then you already know how it &apos;s done .
gentle .
if you do it right ,
no harm will befall it ,
unless of course , you will it .
i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s innocent .
nothing is innocent .
now it belongs to me .
you see , when you take a heart ,
it becomes enchanted .
stronger than a normal heart .
you &apos;re not hurting the beast .
you &apos;re controlling it .
now show me you know what to do with that power .
kill it .
what ?
you &apos;ve seen it done . now do it yourself .
show me you can take the next step in your training .
crush it .
dearie , dearie , dearie .
and i had such high hopes .
and i didn &apos;t sign up to kill unicorns .
magic is power .
until you can take power ,
you &apos;re not learning anything .
do you want me to teach you or not ?
yes .
then there &apos;s one simple question for you to ponder .
i &apos;ll tell you anything .
i don &apos;t need the answer . you do .
what &apos;s holding you back ?
his name was daniel .
i preserved his body with an enchantment spell .
he &apos;s dead , but frozen ,
and i &apos;ve kept him in my family mausoleum .
because you couldn &apos;t let go of him .
if you can &apos;t let go of the past , regina ,
it &apos;s doomed to haunt you .
you know what ?
i think this has been quite enough .
regina , wait . i @-@ i can help you .
i doubt it .
daniel ?
all right .
come on .
what &apos;s with the yawn ?
this isn &apos;t school . it should be fun .
i couldn &apos;t sleep .
i know .
i miss &apos; em , too .
now just think how happy emma and snow will be
when they come home to find that you &apos;ve become a proper knight .
say hello to your steed .
is he mine ?
this one &apos;s yours .
really ?
so ... how do i get on him ?
oh , you &apos;re not riding today .
i &apos;m not ?
no . there &apos;s much to learn before you hop in the saddle .
like what ?
well , every morning ,
you &apos;ll have to muck out his stall .
then you &apos;ll brush him and feed him .
after school , you &apos;ll do it again .
every day , twice a day .
that &apos;s not riding . that &apos;s babysitting .
ah . horsesitting .
it builds an essential bond--
the trust between knight and steed .
okay . but when will i ride him ?
when the horse tells you .
i &apos;m gonna go check in on the dwarves ,
see how the mining &apos;s coming .
i &apos;ll pick you up later .
so ...
anything you wanna tell me ?
are you ready to begin ?
oh , i &apos;ve been ready .
the question is , are you ?
yes , i am .
tell me why you &apos;re really here .
for power--
stop wasting my time !
what is it you want ? come on .
you &apos;ve done all your soul @-@ searching .
now tell me .
can you teach me
how to use magic to bring back the dead ?
that &apos;s what this is about ? the stable boy ?
i want true happiness .
then find it elsewhere , dearie .
magic can do much , but not that .
dead is dead .
then i am lost .
and i &apos;ve had my time wasted .
i &apos;m sorry , but , uh , transcending death is beyond
even my reach .
i thought nothing was beyond your reach .
busy . should i--
no . no .
nothing important going on here .
rumplestiltskin--
ignore her .
i got what you wanted .
what about the slippers ?
oh . couldn &apos;t find &apos; em .
heard talk they &apos;ve already been moved to another land .
that &apos;s what i needed to get to that other land .
well , come with me in my hat .
i &apos;m sure we can work something out .
no , no . your hat only transports between magical realms .
i need to get to a land without magic .
why would anyone want that ?
my business .
you want the ball or not ?
yes .
help yourself to as much gold as you deem appropriate .
oh , and , you .
you can let yourself out . our work is done .
wait . so that &apos;s it ?
you &apos;re not going to teach me anymore ?
so long as you harbor foolish notions
of bringing back the dead ,
so long as you live in the past ,
you &apos;ll never find your future .
teaching you is a waste of time .
pardon me ... for eavesdropping ,
but i think you need to look elsewhere for assistance .
what do you know about it ?
i hear things .
jefferson &apos;s the name ,
and i &apos;m a man who travels and sees much ,
and i know the man who can do what you want--
bring back the dead .
he &apos;s , um , you might say ...
a wizard .
i can bring him to you .
at what price ?
always a price indeed . so here &apos;s mine .
like i said , i &apos;m a man of travels ,
and i &apos;ve made many enemies along the way ,
and i &apos;d like a royal passport
so i can have free reign to traverse your kingdom .
how would i do that ?
well , you &apos;re the queen ... aren &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s right . i am .
and this wizard ...
can he really bring someone back from the dead ?
well , if he can &apos;t , no one can .
have you seen him before ?
yes , i &apos;ve seen him around . he &apos;s a blacksmith .
came to our camp a couple months ago .
said he lost his hand in an ogre attack .
why would cora leave a survivor ?
it &apos;s messy . doesn &apos;t make sense .
you think he &apos;s lying ?
i think cora &apos;s tricked us before .
i don &apos;t want that to happen again .
here you go .
i can &apos;t thank you enough for your kindness .
fortune , it seems , has seen fit to show me favor .
an island full of corpses . you &apos;re the only one to escape .
how exactly did that happen ?
she attacked at night ,
slaughtered everyone in one fell swoop .
when she started ripping out people &apos;s hearts ,
i hid under the bodies of those who had already been killed .
pretended to be dead myself .
mercifully , the ruse worked .
so much for fortune favoring the brave .
it was all i could do to survive .
i &apos;m gonna let you in on a little secret .
i &apos;m pretty good at knowing when someone is lying to me .
i &apos;m telling you the truth .
we should leave here
in case cora decides to come back .
we should start searching
for a new portal back to storybrooke .
i only got about five minutes with my husband .
not to mention , my grandson .
you have a grandson ?
long story .
well , i know this land well . i can guide you .
you &apos;re not gonna guide us anywhere
until you tell us who you really are .
dr. whale ?
where are you ?
where is he--this wizard ?
you promised to bring him to me .
indeed , and off we shall go to see him ,
but i warn you , be cautious .
why ?
is he dangerous ?
not to us .
but bear in mind ,
he &apos;s never been to a world like this before .
he &apos;s unfamiliar with our ways ,
with our magic .
all i care about are his ways ,
and if they will do what i require .
well , there &apos;s only one way to find out .
may i present to you ...
your salvation ?
you &apos;re the wizard ?
i prefer &quot; doctor , &quot;
but you &apos;re welcome to call me whatever makes you comfortable .
very well ...
doctor .
you understand why you &apos;ve been brought here ?
of course .
now ...
show me the patient .
it &apos;s remarkable .
it &apos;s as if his last breath was drawn just moments ago .
a preservation spell .
can you bring him back ?
perhaps .
let &apos;s take a look .
it &apos;s wonderful .
his condition is ideal--
apart from being dead , that is .
just how many times have you done this , doctor ?
you didn &apos;t tell her ?
tell--
tell me ? tell me what ?
the procedure is experimental .
success is yet to occur .
but if certain conditions are met , i &apos;m optimistic .
optimistic ?
just hear him out .
what kind of charlatan are you ?
i am no such thing .
i was told the last crucial piece
of the puzzle exists in this land .
what else do you need ?
a heart .
it &apos;s a fragile organ ,
and i need a strong one .
i &apos;ve searched the far reaches of my realm
for one with the fortitude to stand the shock of my procedure .
none have survived .
but they say in your land ,
there are hearts transformed by magic .
hearts made so powerful , they glow .
that &apos;s why you &apos;ve come here ?
i need this for my work .
so tell me--how do you change these hearts ?
how do you enchant them ?
those who practice the dark arts do it by ripping the organ
out of the living while it still beats .
and you can do this ?
no .
huh .
you assured me that
this queen was some powerful sorceress .
i will not use magic for evil .
well , if you want your fiance back ,
then you &apos;re gonna have to find someone who will .
have i wasted my time here ?
no .
i know exactly who can help us .
i know where to get a heart .
dr. whale ?
whale .
whale .
i know you took daniel &apos;s body ,
and you took one of my hearts .
why ?
why ? !
did you bring him back ?
i did it .
he &apos;s alive .
yes .
i brought him back , but ...
he &apos;s not daniel .
what ?
he &apos;s ... he &apos;s a monster .
this ...
was my mother &apos;s .
how sweet ,
but i &apos;m not interested in heirlooms .
oh , i believe you will be .
listen .
to a fireplace ?
just listen .
where is that coming from ?
her vault .
take your pick .
these are all ... hearts ?
my mother was a collector .
whose hearts are these ?
i have no idea .
she took so many ,
caused so much pain .
it was impossible to keep track .
she was a monster .
finally . after all this time .
it &apos;s perfect .
what &apos;s going on ?
i just got a call that dr. whale was attacked .
you &apos;ll have to ask his doctors .
no . i am asking you .
i came here to speak with him and discovered he was hurt .
it &apos;s the truth .
what else ?
what did you come here to speak with him about ?
someone from my past .
i believe he &apos;s come back .
daniel .
his name is daniel .
the man you were supposed to marry .
snow told me what happened , and ...
how it was her fault that he died .
yes .
he did .
well , then how could he be back ?
whale .
he believed he could bring him back from the grave ,
and ... i don &apos;t know how ...
but he has .
you don &apos;t know how ?
guess .
he practices something more powerful than magic ...
or so i was told .
all he needed was a heart , and he took one of mine .
you have hearts here ?
in my vault .
from our land .
whose heart did he take ?
i have no idea .
i took so many . it was impossible to keep track .
i need to go .
i have to help him .
no . where is he ?
look what he did . he &apos;s dangerous .
not to me .
he won &apos;t hurt anyone else , david , i promise .
you know i can &apos;t take that chance .
you have two choices , regina .
tell me where he is , or jail .
i think it &apos;s like when ... you awoke from your coma .
he &apos;s following his final toughts
to where he last met me--
the stables .
no .
henry .
henry &apos;s at the stables .
gramps says that you &apos;ll tell me when i &apos;m ready to ride you .
so ... anytime .
like , soon ?
i already told you . i &apos;m just a blacksmith .
sure you are .
you don &apos;t want to talk to us ?
maybe you &apos;ll talk to the ogres while they rip you limb from limb .
come on .
what ?
you--you can &apos;t just leave me here like this !
what if he &apos;s telling the truth ?
he &apos;s not .
good for you !
you bested me .
i can count the amount of people who &apos;ve done that on one hand .
that supposed to be funny ?
who are you ?
killian jones .
but most people have taken to call me
by my more colorful moniker--
hook .
hook .
check my satchel .
as in captain hook ?
ah , so you &apos;ve heard of me .
you better hurry up . they &apos;re getting closer .
so unless you wanna be dinner , you better start talking .
cora wanted me to gain your trust .
so i could learn everything there is to know
about your storybrooke .
she didn &apos;t want any surprises when she finally got over there .
she can &apos;t get there . we destroyed the wardrobe .
ah , but the enchantment remains .
cora gathered the ashes .
she &apos;s gonna use them to open up a portal .
now if you &apos;ll kindly cut me loose .
no . we should leave him here to die
to pay for all the lives that he took .
that was cora , not me .
let &apos;s go .
wait . wait !
you need me alive .
why ?
because we both want the same thing--
to get back to your land .
you would say anything to save yourself .
why are we supposed to believe you now ?
i arranged for transport with cora ,
but seeing how resourceful you are ,
i &apos;ll offer you the same deal .
i &apos;ll help you .
if you promise to take me along .
how are you going to help us get home ?
the ashes will open a portal ,
but to find your land , she needs more .
there &apos;s an enchanted compass . cora seeks it .
i &apos;ll help you obtain it before she does .
so cora won &apos;t make it to storybrooke ,
and we &apos;ll be one step closer to getting home .
sounds too good to be true .
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
you tell me one thing--
and whatever you say , i better believe it--
why does captain hook want to go to storybrooke ?
to exact revenge on the man who took my hand--
rumplestiltskin .
you--you gotta stop . you &apos;re-- you &apos;re scaring the horses .
are--are--are you hurt ?
can i help you ?
let me help you .
daniel !
let him go !
are you okay ?
yeah .
go . go !
it &apos;s true .
you &apos;re really here .
it won &apos;t hold for long .
can you cast a spell to subdue him ?
no . i won &apos;t use magic on him .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
he &apos;s a monster , regina !
if you won &apos;t put him down , i will !
david , please !
just let me talk to him .
it &apos;s too big of a risk . there &apos;s no telling what he &apos;ll do .
you have to at least give me a chance !
out of the way , regina ! now !
no ! i won &apos;t let you hurt him !
he &apos;ll listen to me !
please !
let me talk to my fiance .
the heart , your majesty .
thank you .
now please , wait here .
the procedure is one i must perform alone .
what &apos;s he doing back there ? magic ?
he says he wields power greater than magic .
really ?
why won &apos;t he let us see ?
in his land , there &apos;s much we don &apos;t understand ,
or can &apos;t .
if he can &apos;t achieve what you seek ,
rumplestiltskin was right . it can &apos;t be done .
well ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i failed .
the heart wasn &apos;t strong enough .
it couldn &apos;t withstand the procedure .
daniel .
stop .
it &apos;s me .
i love you .
regina .
daniel .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really you .
daniel ?
stop .
just stop the pain .
how ?
just ...
let me go .
no .
no , i won &apos;t lose you again .
without you , i &apos;m lost .
daniel .
daniel , come back to me .
can &apos;t . can &apos;t .
but i love you .
then love again .
good @-@ bye , daniel .
up ahead .
we &apos;ll find the compass just over the ridge .
do you get the feeling he &apos;s leading us
exactly where cora wants us , that this whole thing &apos;s a trap ?
it &apos;s definitely a trap .
as long as we know they &apos;re trying to play us , we can--
stay one step ahead of them .
exactly .
let me guess .
the compass is up there ?
oh , yeah .
so how do we ...
get to it ?
it &apos;s not the climb you need to worry about .
it &apos;s the giant at the top .
who &apos;s this ?
ah , your replacement , of course .
i needed someone more dedicated .
dedicated ?
now .
where were we ?
you &apos;re back .
i used magic .
why don &apos;t you come in and tell me what happened ?
enough .
i need to be taken home .
now i have work to do , and i believe our deal is done .
the deal isn &apos;t done until he says it &apos;s done .
now , now .
patience , please . our transaction is , uh ,
nearly complete .
and are you satisfied with the results ?
she did seem rather ... heartbroken .
she is .
she bought my failure .
you should &apos;ve seen her tears .
i &apos;ve seen the aftermath .
impressive .
now ... my property .
yeah , here it is .
you &apos;ll excuse me if i check .
it &apos;s been a pleasure doing business with you .
oh , the pleasure was mine .
thanks to your efforts , i &apos;ve made my monster .
now i do hope
you &apos;ll be able to make yours .
i &apos;m not making a monster .
sure you &apos;re not . good luck .
if these hearts are as strong as you say , i won &apos;t need luck .
oh , just magic .
no . what i &apos;m going to accomplish goes far beyond magic .
and yet you need a magical heart to do it .
so small @-@ minded .
i need my powers to transcend the limitations of your magic .
this must be quite a land you hail from
if you think your abilities are more powerful .
they are .
care to wager ?
i suspect someday you &apos;ll see it my way .
i doubt it .
now may we go ?
careful , dearie .
just remember ,
whatever it is you traffic in , it comes with a price .
we &apos;ll see .
when they say i charge an arm and a leg ,
that &apos;s meant as a figure of speech .
put it back .
you want me to reattach your arm ?
can you do it ?
of course .
but first ,
tell me why .
because i want to use it again .
obviously .
i meant why bring that stable boy
back from the dead ? why now ?
i thought ...
i thought that if i helped her ,
she would return me to my world .
i want to see my brother ,
to try to bring him back again .
again ?
the first time ended badly .
i need to return and try it once more .
well , it seems that &apos;s rather beyond her abilities .
my condolences .
now my arm .
you said you can do it .
oh , yes .
but there &apos;s a difference between &quot; can &quot; and &quot; will . &quot;
name your price .
say it .
say what ?
you know what .
you came here , not the hospital .
so say it .
i need magic .
that &apos;s all i needed to hear .
always a pleasure doing business with you , uh , victor .
doctor .
you &apos;ve returned .
did you find what you were looking for ?
yes .
look at it .
it &apos;s remarkable , isn &apos;t it ?
the final piece to the puzzle .
i believe so .
let &apos;s begin .
it &apos;s alive .
you did it .
victor , you did it .
yes .
i believe i have .
welcome back , brother .
it &apos;s magic , dr. frankenstein .
no .
not magic .
