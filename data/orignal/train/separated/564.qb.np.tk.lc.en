i think i &apos;m failing psychopharmacology .
why are you taking that ?
i thought it was a class
about crazy farm animals , okay ?
let &apos;s finish the unit .
i don &apos;t want to be late for lunch .
&quot; amar &quot; is &quot; to love , &quot; right ?
oh ! speaking of love ,
shirley , how &apos;s it going with the sexy dreadlock guy ?
oh , i &apos;m sure i don &apos;t have a chance with him .
abed and i talked to him by the vending machines .
he asked about you .
he specifically asked about me ?
when annie brought you up , he specifically asked ,
&quot; who is that ? &quot;
abed .
what ? that &apos;s what he said .
abed , your social skills aren &apos;t exactly streets ahead .
you know what i mean ?
i don &apos;t .
you &apos;re not alone in this case .
pierce , stop trying to coin the phrase ,
&quot; streets ahead . &quot;
trying ?
coined and minted .
been there , coined that .
&quot; streets ahead &quot; is verbal wildfire .
does it just mean &quot; cool , &quot; or is it
supposed to be , like , &quot; miles ahead &quot; ?
if you have to ask , you &apos;re &quot; streets fine . &quot;
okay , we can banter if we want to banter ,
but i &apos;m warning you i am leaving for lunch early .
me too .
me three .
streets ahead .
man , you guys really love these stupid chicken fingers , huh ?
uh , they &apos;re not stupid .
they &apos;re the only good thing in the cafeteria .
i haven &apos;t had one in weeks . they run out so fast .
if god were edible-- not that i &apos;m catholic ,
but if it was cool to eat god ,
he &apos;d be a chicken finger .
well , i wouldn &apos;t know .
i &apos;m a vegetarian .
shocker .
yeah .
and if you guys knew how they treated
the animals that you are eating ,
you would eat them even faster
just to put them out of their misery .
and then you would throw up .
i don &apos;t know .
maybe i &apos;m feeling extra protective
of animals today because my cat is sick .
oh , a cat ?
that &apos;s awful .
he has diabetes .
he can &apos;t even make it to the litter box--
chicken run !
i &apos;m afraid that i &apos;m gonna have to put her to sleep .
ah , go on .
god bless you .
save some for me !
watch out !
oh , i can hear those fingers calling my name .
&quot; troy ! troy ! &quot;
troy , did you get my text message ?
i think it &apos;s--
i got to stop hanging out with her .
she sounds like a chicken finger .
again ?
outrageous .
at least apologize .
how can you just stand there like a mute idiot ?
well , throat surgery might humanize you ,
but it doesn &apos;t make this acceptable .
so cute .
and i don &apos;t even normally like dreadlocks .
hello .
his dreadlocks remind me of the predator ,
which is weird , because you &apos;re doing the actual hunting
and you seem invisible to him .
abed , you know what i do ?
hmm ?
before i talk , i ask myself ,
&quot; what am i about to say
and how might it affect each person listening ? &quot;
i &apos;m really glad you said that , britta .
the idea that you compulsively filter yourself
makes your lack of flavor kind of a flavor .
sorry , guys . they ran out again .
something &apos;s gotta be done .
hey !
what the hell , man ?
that &apos;s half our problem right there .
star @-@ burns works the fryer and skims fingers .
no way .
he gives them to people just so
they &apos;ll act like he isn &apos;t star @-@ burns .
well , i may not eat meat ,
but i am not gonna eat that injustice .
let &apos;s complain .
if we complain , he gets a warning and learns to be sneakier .
i say we knock him out of the kitchen
and replace him with one of our own
all in one move .
then we &apos;re the ones with the chicken .
it &apos;s like a mafia movie .
as far back as i can remember ,
i always wanted to be in a mafia movie .
cool .
that &apos;s exactly what it &apos;s like , abed ,
and you get the most important job .
you &apos;re gonna be fry cook .
we may be watching different mafia movies .
you worked in your dad &apos;s restaurant , right ?
well , you &apos;ll apply for the job
after we get star @-@ burns fired .
i don &apos;t know about that .
i don &apos;t know about the firing .
i think he really relies on that income .
yeah , man .
every day you flock here like sheep
and wait in line for a broken promise from a dirty system .
back in those days ,
jeff winger was the guy that made things happen .
he always knew what to say
and he always knew when to slap the table .
you want to be sheep , keep flocking .
you want to be wolves , form a pack .
and that was it . it was that simple .
at that moment , we stopped being a family
and started being a family ... in italics .
britta got cozy with star @-@ burns .
can i touch both at--oh !
yeah , do &apos; em both .
he lowered his guard ,
he was gone .
i mean , the way jeff saw it , by not respecting us ,
star @-@ burns had basically brought it on himself .
and when his job opened up , we did what we had to do
to keep the list of applicants to a minimum .
i had worked in my dad &apos;s falafel restaurant ,
so i had a pretty impressive resume .
it &apos;s very impressive .
especially your reference .
just give &apos; em a call right now .
but we weren &apos;t taking any chances .
the fix was in .
trump tower , this is donald .
well , he can deep @-@ fry the hell out of chicken .
i can tell you that .
troy even applied for the same job
and gave the world &apos;s worst interview
just to make me look better
and that was that .
this was the glorious time .
no more racing to the cafeteria .
no more lines .
to us , lines were for suckers , hacks , sheep .
we were wolves .
and we had the chicken to prove it .
to victory .
it feels unfamiliar , but it tastes like chicken .
hi .
hello .
you guys are lucky .
they &apos;re always running out .
would you like one ?
name &apos;s shirley . memorize it .
i will , shirley .
see that , girls ?
the universe goes by supply and demand .
the more you take and use , the more it sends .
somebody &apos;s been taking a little extra .
what &apos;s in that container ?
eight fingers .
abed .
abed &apos;s study group .
why are you giving chang chicken ?
we have an agreement .
but , abed ,
if you get caught skimming , you get fired
and we all go back to eating like britta .
yeah , we put you in that job .
i dressed like a crazy pharaoh for you , man .
you make the fingers , abed , not the decisions .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay , buddy .
but just remember these things have power .
so just let me know next time
you have any more agreements , all right ?
yeah , i agreed to give chang eight fingers per lunch
in exchange for a 10 % bump on every spanish test
for each of us .
okay .
abed makes the fingers and the decisions .
yeah .
yeah .
oh , abed , you &apos;re the best .
at greendale , they were always out of chicken fingers ,
so whoever could get them had power .
and i was the guy in the apron ,
so i came up with a system
and pretty soon half the chicken at greendale
was going out the side door .
everybody in our crew had a job .
t @-@ bone was the bag man .
he &apos;d move the fingers to a storeroom
where two of the girls did the packaging .
we could trust them not to eat the supply
because britta was a vegetarian
and shirley figured that if she stole ,
she &apos;d go to hell .
they &apos;d hand the stuff out the window to annie .
she was the leg man and distributor .
the crazy thing was it was their food
and we were stealing it and giving it back to them
like it was a big favor .
nobody asked any questions
because pierce &apos;s experience as a ceo
had taught him how to keep the wheels from squeaking .
i had it all worked out on a schedule .
you know , i &apos;ve never been fired from a job .
the minute before you thought about busting us ,
that was the minute you had a chicken in your hand .
really , it &apos;s just insulting
that you &apos;re eating his chicken finger in front of me .
everyone had their hand out .
everyone wanted what we had .
and jeff had the most important job of all .
he was at the top .
he was the boss .
he was our leader .
what the hell is going on ?
av kids hooked it up .
abed supplied the whole department with chicken fingers .
you think that &apos;s good ,
check out my posse and troy &apos;s monkey .
why do you have a monkey ?
uh , it &apos;s an animal that looks like a dude .
why don &apos;t i have ten of them ?
guys , look what abed scored for me .
it has a million zippers
and it was free .
oh , robot .
i am a robot .
i am programmed to love this backpack .
this is insane .
more insane than programming them to replace auto workers ?
what ?
okay , okay , if you &apos;re not in this study group , please .
no , no .
that means you , sexy dreadlocks ,
britta &apos;s hairdresser ...
what ?
pierce &apos;s hackneyed entourage .
hackneyed ?
you see the turban guy ?
yes , in a 90 &apos;s ski movie that featured an entourage .
don &apos;t you guys think this is getting out of hand ?
oh , we &apos;re not gonna get caught .
we have campus security on the take .
abed &apos;s got it all figured out .
well , that &apos;s a relief .
yeah , it &apos;s pretty cool being friends with the biggest man on campus .
isn &apos;t that right , annie &apos;s boobs ?
please rename that thing !
and this time , not with a contest on twitter .
it &apos;s his twitter account .
he can do what he wants .
they are my body parts !
you know what i don &apos;t appreciate ?
i do not consent to this !
i had sexy dreadlocks ...
you wouldn &apos;t threaten a monkey .
i wouldn &apos;t threaten a monkey .
they have more lactic acid than us .
shared my chicken with him .
talk to the backpack .
i told you !
you &apos;re the worst , annie .
streets ahead !
line starts behind you .
oh , he &apos;s cool .
six fingers every wednesday .
cool . and what can you offer ?
i have a bicycle
and i teach beginner &apos;s tennis .
cool . okay .
six fingers wednesdays .
all right .
we &apos;ll be in touch , janel .
thank you , abed .
you &apos;re welcome .
hey , jeff .
hey , buddy .
it &apos;s quite a setup you got here .
yean . i &apos;m pretty excited about it .
it turns out everyone has needs
and everyone has functions .
look , um , i &apos;ve been thinking ,
maybe i need to hit the big red button
and bring an end to this operation .
i mean , it &apos;s been fun ,
but it &apos;s out of control now .
am i right ?
i don &apos;t know .
the entire campus is controlled by our group ,
our group is controlled by chicken ,
and the chicken is controlled by me .
float ?
i &apos;m good .
abed , the mafia movie is over .
i &apos;m not doing a mafia movie .
in fact , i don &apos;t need to use movies
or tv shows to talk to people anymore .
before , i only needed them
because the day @-@ to @-@ day world made no sense to me ,
but now , everyone &apos;s speaking the same language .
chicken .
i understand people and they finally understand me .
abed , eventually people are gonna get tired of chicken .
i &apos;m tired of chicken .
you &apos;re not tired of chicken .
you miss the taste of control .
well , that &apos;s crazy .
is it ?
unfortunately , the very thing that drove you to this dorm room
is what would prevent you from properly running this machine
or even being a cog in it .
your ego .
well ...
i see . i see .
this has been about me the whole time .
you want a shot at the jeff winger throne ?
you better bring a powerful ass .
oh , and for your information , i don &apos;t have an ego .
my facebook photo is a landscape .
you &apos;re the best , eduardo .
thank you all for coming .
can we make this quick ?
i need to give a banana to annie &apos;s boobs .
abed is drunk with chicken power .
he &apos;s gone from lovable johnny five to evil hal .
hal holb-- - not hal holbrook .
what are you saying ?
you all have to stop working for him .
let this operation dry up and let his wheels spin down .
at which point you would be in charge again , right ?
what ?
this is so sad .
you &apos;re jealous of abed because he &apos;s providing for us .
no , i &apos;m concerned about abed
because he won &apos;t listen to reason .
won &apos;t listen to your reason .
why should he ? jeff &apos;s so not ...
say &quot; streets ahead &quot; and die .
streets ahead .
you want to boss me around ?
get me an entourage . get troy a monkey .
that &apos;s what a real boss does .
yes .
we probably shouldn &apos;t even be talking to him without checking with abed .
i &apos;m already trying him .
he &apos;s not picking up . what did you do with him ?
i don &apos;t believe what greedy sellouts
you people turned out to be .
i &apos;m not gonna stand here and be ignored .
shh ! voicemail .
hey , abed .
jeff says you &apos;re not listening to him .
does that mean we shouldn &apos;t listen to him either ?
oh , also , should we make special jackets
for our crime family ?
like , blazers with chicken finger patches .
i don &apos;t know . long message . i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s it !
ooh ! abed !
look , i &apos;m walking out this door right now .
okay .
for real .
good .
i &apos;m not gonna look back .
good @-@ bye .
good @-@ bye !
abed !
hi !
yes !
anybody need anything ?
oh , everything . you look handsome .
i like everything about you now , abed .
i want a new hairdresser though .
yeah , i got you fired .
you deserved it .
maybe . maybe not .
the question is : what do they deserve ?
key to the kitchen .
there &apos;s a valve on the back of the chicken fryer
that &apos;s not made anymore .
now , say someone were to remove it .
the fryer wouldn &apos;t work ...
forever .
how petty do you think i am ?
jeff leaving the family didn &apos;t turn out to be a problem .
okay , i think we &apos;re set for the quiz .
yep .
see you guys in class .
oh , wait . before you go .
oh , free notebooks .
here .
but the family &apos;s success started to go to their heads .
they didn &apos;t have college ruled ?
no , sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
abed ?
yeah ?
can i talk to you for a minute ?
sure .
we have a situation .
hey .
who is this ?
it &apos;s travis .
you said you wanted someone in your entourage named travis .
show him your license .
travis is his middle name .
i go by travis .
no , you go by the door .
see you , travis .
abed ?
yep ?
no , no , no , no .
my monkey hates this caviar .
troy , isn &apos;t that--
they were spoiled , fat , lazy .
i &apos;d given them everything and somehow
i &apos;d lost their respect .
so i did the only thing i could think of .
i did what i thought jeff would do .
i sent them a message .
what is that ?
i think it might be a backpack that &apos;s been mutilated .
these were the bad times .
there he is .
jeff .
jeff !
jeff !
jeff !
jeff !
abed killed my backpack .
and i caught him stuffing my man
full of chicken and tyler perry has a whole series of movies
about why that &apos;s wrong .
that little arab is off his rocker .
he released annie &apos;s boobs .
annie &apos;s boobs could be anywhere .
annie &apos;s boobs could be on the side of the road .
we got it .
the monkey &apos;s name is &quot; annie &apos;s boobs . &quot;
look what abed did to my hair .
i feel terrible for all of you .
wait , no , i don &apos;t , because i warned you
about all this , but you were so high on your backpacks and hairstyles ,
you accused me of being jealous .
you were right . but what can we do ?
i &apos;m sorry , you brushed over that first part .
together .
you were right .
now what you can do is go home
and write that on your bathroom mirror .
wouldn &apos;t that make it seem like i was right ?
yeah , because it would be my mirror .
i don &apos;t have a mirror ...
it &apos;s not gonna be reversed because you &apos;re the one who--
as for abed , for his sake ,
i guess i &apos;ll have to take him out .
poor little guy .
oh , good . that &apos;s nice .
abed .
what are you doing ?
making tater tots .
you were right , people got sick of chicken .
but i was close .
i just need a new food , a new system .
i &apos;m gonna experiment with jalapeno poppers next
and then zucchini zircles .
i don &apos;t get it .
it &apos;s not that complicated , jeff .
they replaced the &quot; c &quot; in circle with a &quot; z &quot; for zucchini .
no , no , i mean , why are you here ?
you said you were close ?
what were you close to ?
to the group ?
to people ?
please don &apos;t do a special episode about me .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t dream of it .
everyone else needs my help .
that &apos;s what people don &apos;t get ,
is that they need to get me .
i just need to be able to connect to people like you can ,
and then i can make everyone happy .
do you know why i &apos;m here ?
you got caught with a fake bachelor &apos;s degree .
by the way , they started using that as a seasonal arc on &quot; law &amp; order . &quot;
total rip off .
i &apos;m here to dismantle the fryer ,
to cut your power off at its source .
don &apos;t you see what happened ?
i manipulated the group into getting you the fry cook job
so i could have some chicken .
and you turned it all into a way to make everyone like you .
made me ashamed of myself .
made me jealous .
maybe this is a special episode .
it &apos;s pretty alarming behavior , jeff .
yeah .
you know , there &apos;s specialists you could talk to .
yeah , maybe i should do that .
mm @-@ hmm .
in the meantime ...
mm @-@ hmm ?
let &apos;s make a deal .
i &apos;ll help you connect with people ,
and you help me do a better job with them .
like &quot; knight rider . &quot;
exactly . like &quot; knight rider . &quot;
deal .
i &apos;ll put on a leather jacket
and make out with an aerobics instructor .
you pull around front and comedically
startle passersby with your ability to talk .
maybe we should just stay here
and have a plate of chicken fingers .
cool .
can we eat them while sitting on a table
like in &quot; sixteen candles &quot; ?
pick one reference , abed .
&quot; sixteen candles &quot;
and just like that , the mafia movie was over .
i quit the fry cook job ,
somewhat for the sake of the family ,
but mostly for the sake of jeff &apos;s ego .
poor guy .
things went back to normal .
now everyone &apos;s back to being a bunch of regular schnooks ,
and i &apos;m back to being a weirdo ,
back to watching from the outside ...
for now .
there &apos;s still not enough chicken fingers .
no way .
what ?
&apos;cause as soon as our family moved out ,
a new syndicate moved in to take its place .
but you know what they &apos;ll never make a replacement for ?
friends .
okay , thank you . that &apos;s great , abed .
but could you just answer the question ?
what was it ?
do you know who might have stolen
a box of hairnets from the kitchen ?
someone with hair .
i &apos;m gonna write that down .
ready ?
mm @-@ hmm .
never been done .
that &apos;s nice .
here i come .
back up at same stairs .
it &apos;s good .
double escalator .
i haven &apos;t see that before . how did you think of that ?
and now for our signature trick .
awesome elevator .
no .
i can &apos;t do it .
i got babies . i gotta get home .
it &apos;s their loss .
yeah .
