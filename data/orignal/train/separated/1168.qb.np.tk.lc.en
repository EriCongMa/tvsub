it &apos;s my turn to torture you .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a box of ali &apos;s things .
jason found it . he gave it to me .
you &apos;re afraid we found something ,
something in this box .
no ! ali !
that &apos;s &quot; a &quot; &apos; s cellphone .
hanna , call caleb .
he &apos;s the best way that we can get information on--
no , leave him out of this .
n.a.t. club ? jason delaurentis , n.a.t.
garrett reynolds , n.a.t.
&quot; for we see all . &quot;
noel broke up with me , and i don &apos;t even know why .
maybe you went out with the wrong person tonight .
i saw the way you looked at him before the show .
when my mom gets here , can you not mention this to her ?
as long as you promise to do the same .
i know that you want answers ,
but it &apos;s just still not safe .
then why did you come here ?
shutting you out is killing me .
the owner shut down the phone .
are you sure you want me to work on this ?
yes !
yes !
hanna , are you all right with this ?
i passed your mom heading out .
then it &apos;s go time .
hanna ?
hanna .
how much did caleb get ?
i don &apos;t know . he said he was up most the night .
it &apos;s not like we expected
decrypting files from &quot; a &quot; &apos; s phone was gonna be easy .
is caleb still asking whose phone it is ?
every chance he gets , and i &apos;m still lying to him .
now that we know that it wasn &apos;t lucas ,
my money &apos;s on officer garrett
in the greenhouse with the cellphone .
but jenna broke up with garrett .
yeah , after the greenhouse .
look , the point is caleb is still asking about everything
and it &apos;s not safe for him to know the answers .
we should just tell him to stop .
let &apos;s just take a look first .
come closer . i know you want to kiss me .
this-- this was all caleb was able to get ?
wait . look , that &apos;s alison &apos;s bedroom .
what &apos;s ian doing in there ?
what &apos;s he doing with that camera ?
oh , my god , he &apos;s hiding it .
he was recording this secretly .
wait , recording what ?
hey .
what the hell are jenna and garrett doing in alison &apos;s bedroom ?
n.a.t. club field trip ?
ian and garrett are the founding members .
the only one missing is ...
where &apos;s jason ?
he &apos;s passed out .
a six @-@ pack and some weed &apos;ll do that to you .
so , why the emergency call ?
i just left alison .
i tried to get her to hand over our videos ,
but she wasn &apos;t going for it .
heh , is that the only thing she wasn &apos;t going for ?
shut up , jenna .
hey , this is your fault , ian .
i knew you &apos;d go too far
and those videos would come back to bite us .
that &apos;s why i bailed on this messed @-@ up plot .
oh , yeah ? well , welcome back .
now we find them before that bitch shows up .
so , caleb has seen this ?
he couldn &apos;t have gotten it off that phone without seeing it .
now you know why i &apos;m freaking out !
yeah , but the closer we get to finding out what really happened--
the closer caleb gets to the top of &quot; a &apos;s &quot; hit list .
he , she , it has messed with all our relationships--
toby , ezra , samara ...
look .
check this out .
what is it ?
it &apos;s just an old box .
that &apos;s weird .
that &apos;s the box jason gave me .
caleb &apos;s done . i &apos;m telling him today .
so what does this mean ?
well , in case we had any doubts ,
the n.a.t. club , jenna included ,
was in rosewood .
in alison &apos;s bedroom .
the night ali was murdered .
when did you get this ?
while you were downstairs .
so , aria and hanna haven &apos;t seen this .
i thought you were trying to keep your distance .
i was , okay ? i am . it &apos;s just that
i slipped up last week and i kissed him ,
and now toby thinks that we &apos;re back together ,
and i can &apos;t even--
talk to him .
what do you want me to say ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know . that i &apos;m not here .
no , that i &apos;m in the shower .
don &apos;t make me lie to him , spencer .
please !
is spencer around ?
um , she &apos;s unable to come to the phone right now .
i came by to pick up the rest of my tools .
spencer &apos;s dad ...
yeah , i heard .
how &apos;s spencer ?
okay .
she misses you .
i miss her .
she &apos;s been kind of confusing lately .
the other day in my truck ,
she said she was close to telling me something ,
to explaining what &apos;s been happening .
things have changed since then .
can you tell me anything ?
no . i don &apos;t want to get between you and spencer .
i don &apos;t think this is about me and her .
i think it &apos;s something else .
emily ! just-- get off !
spencer &apos;s dad is here .
you should probably come back later .
when he &apos;s not here ,
or when spencer &apos;s not here ?
and he just drove away ?
what else was he supposed to do ?
totally shut him down .
you &apos;re protecting somebody that you love .
it &apos;s kind of romantic .
no , it &apos;s the opposite of romantic .
it &apos;s safe .
it &apos;s what we all need to be .
hey , well , at least toby still wants to talk to you .
because that was definitely not the case last time i saw ezra .
which makes me wonder :
was that the last time i &apos;ll ever see him ?
no , aria .
yeah , but how do i know that ?
he won &apos;t see me . he won &apos;t talk to me .
maybe you just need to give him some time .
i gave him time .
at the play , him sneaking out of the theater ?
that was time .
now i just really want some answers .
how are you going to without your parents knowing ?
without &quot; a &quot; knowing ?
huh , the beard .
the what ?
holden , aria &apos;s beard .
it means he &apos;ll go out with her
but not really out with her
because he &apos;s not really interested .
i know what it means . he &apos;s gay .
he &apos;s not gay . i &apos;ve known him since i was five .
he might not have known when he was five .
has he ever tried to kiss you ?
no .
gay .
so , how &apos;s the whole reintegration
into american society thing going ?
okay . you helped , actually .
i did ? how ?
ah , it &apos;s probably better you don &apos;t know .
okay .
but i owe you one . how &apos;s that ?
well , we &apos;re still on for tomorrow night , right ?
i was counting on it .
good . yeah , &apos; cause that &apos;ll help me .
with your friend who walks out on plays ?
mm , i think it &apos;s best that you don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll call you later .
i &apos;ll answer .
bye .
holden--
forgot your keys .
oh , man , i totally know what that &apos;s like .
you get so wrapped up in something ,
you forget where you are .
two hours later , it &apos;s like ,
&quot; where did i park my car ?
&quot; did i even drive here ? &quot;
thanks .
on the video , garrett looked in the box and saw something weird .
wouldn &apos;t you like to know what it was ?
no . look , we &apos;ve already seen what we needed to see ...
all of our suspects in the same place
at the same time in alison &apos;s room
talking about how much they hated her .
i don &apos;t know why we just don &apos;t hand the drive to the police .
we should be closing things , not opening ...
you guys , there &apos;s something in here .
what is that ?
&quot; my turn to torture you . &quot;
okay , that &apos;s creepy .
&quot; you think you &apos;re safe on the outside ,
but you &apos;re not when i &apos;m on the inside . &quot;
&quot; scared yet ? you should be , bitch . &quot;
these notes are starting to sound familiar .
&quot; next time , it &apos;ll be your face , not this pumpkin . &quot;
looks like it was cut by something .
it was . don &apos;t you guys remember ?
halloween .
i &apos;ve never been this way before .
back alleys and backyards have
always been the best way to my house .
your sister and ian are so cute together .
do you think they &apos;ll get married ?
i guess so . they seem perfect for each other .
yeah , perfectly bored .
ali , someone trashed your porch .
what the hell ?
what does the note say ?
who did this ?
jason &apos;s beer buddies . real funny .
i better get going .
yeah , me too .
what &apos;s the hurry ? let &apos;s make a night of it .
it &apos;s already been kind of a long night .
look , i &apos;m sorry about the prank .
i know i took it too far .
let me make it up to you guys .
&quot; next time , it &apos;ll be your face , not this pumpkin . &quot;
that was the note that ali got .
this is an invitation from noel kahn &apos;s halloween party .
as if my memories of that night could get any scarier .
guys , this note is signed by &quot; a. &quot;
&quot; a &quot; was after alison , too .
before they were after us .
have you talked to her yet ?
not yet .
hey . heard about you and noel .
people in china have heard about me and noel .
don &apos;t let it get to you , all right ? the guy &apos;s a total tool .
i thought we were friends .
you and noel ?
he doesn &apos;t even know what a friend is .
no . you and me .
i &apos;ve been calling you for two days .
mona ...
you can have this back . i &apos;m done with it .
sorry , no returns , no exchanges .
take it ! maybe the next girl you decide to dump all over
will like it better than i did .
i &apos;m so sorry , mona .
just leave me alone .
no ! you &apos;re the worst person for you to be around right now .
that didn &apos;t come out right .
noel &apos;s not worth it .
okay , it &apos;s not like anyone with half a brain
ever trusted him anyways .
hanna !
i &apos;m just saying he &apos;s a bad guy ,
and you deserve way better .
i never knew anyone who could lie like that .
it was second nature with him .
it &apos;s those eyes .
you look into them , and you &apos;re just , like , hypnotized .
so what you &apos;re saying is he could be a really good super villain .
look , i know what you need .
me , you , rive gauche tonight .
we &apos;ll shut the place down .
it &apos;s a date .
ezra . hey .
i &apos;m calling from emily &apos;s phone ,
for obvious reasons .
listen , i really don &apos;t want to think
about us being over , but ...
you know , whether we are or we aren &apos;t ,
it &apos;s something that we should discuss face to face .
so , meet me tonight at 8 : 00
in front of the clock by rittenhouse square .
if you come , it means that there &apos;s still a chance for us ,
and if not ...
no !
when i got the call , no one was sure
how badly you &apos;d been hurt , and--
i was lucky . your mom came home .
i &apos;m so sorry about yesterday .
spencer ...
no , if you &apos;d just gotten your stuff , then ...
spencer , it wouldn &apos;t have made any difference .
what happened ?
i was taking down the scaffolding ,
and the anchors gave away , and , uh ...
you must be the carpenter .
i &apos;m dr. kingston . hello , spencer .
hey .
you two know each other ?
yeah , ren used to date melissa .
was engaged to her , actually ,
before something got in the way .
so , uh , the x @-@ rays confirm the break ,
but it &apos;s clean , should heal well .
we &apos;ll put a cast on it shortly .
you &apos;ll need to spend the night .
why ?
it &apos;s routine when there &apos;s been a concussion ,
so don &apos;t worry .
next emergency . i &apos;ll be back later .
try and be more careful next time , huh ?
spencer .
there something you want to tell me ?
托比下次不会这么幸运了 -a
yeah . okay , bye .
toby &apos;s okay .
yeah , for now .
guys , if jenna really is a part of this ,
do you think she &apos;d actually hurt her own stepbrother ?
jenna would kill and eat her own mother to get back at us .
maybe she &apos;s just trying to scare him .
or us .
yeah , well , it &apos;s working .
but if jenna and garrett broke up ,
how could she do this to toby ?
she must &apos;ve found a replacement .
jenna ?
why &apos;d you go back to that house ?
you were never supposed to go back , toby .
it is not safe with those girls , with spencer--
don &apos;t . talk about her .
don &apos;t mention her name .
you need to be stronger .
i don &apos;t want any advice from you .
who else is there , hmm ?
that knows you as well as i do ,
that cares about you as much as i do
spencer .
you know you &apos;ll never be happy with her .
you &apos;ll never be at peace .
she &apos;s haunted , toby .
i know a little bit about that .
you shouldn &apos; be here
i &apos;m the only person who should be here .
we &apos;re family ...
whether you like it or not
hey .
hey , i &apos;ve been worried about you .
yeah , me too
what the hell is this ?
what do you mean ?
i decoded another segment .
this is about alison delaurentis &apos;s murder , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s complicated .
yeah , i can tell .
hanna , why are you and your friends
looking into a crime that somebody &apos;s already confessed to ?
do you think somebody else killed her ,
somebody in this video ?
caleb ...
no , just tell me what these videos are all about
and stop making me imagine the worst .
whatever you imagine isn &apos;t as bad as it really is .
hey , i can protect you .
you just-- you gotta tell me .
i can &apos;t tell you .
why ? because i can &apos;t handle it ?
because i can &apos;t handle it .
i &apos;m afraid .
i told you , i can protect you .
no , i &apos;m afraid for you .
you just gotta stop working on these videos ,
all right ? they &apos;re dangerous .
i get that .
especially since the people that we &apos;re talking about
are in this town , watching me .
what are you talking about ?
i was working on this today at the cafe ,
and i looked up , and officer garrett
was sitting two tables away .
what are you-- hey !
hanna , hanna ! what the hell !
i spent hours on that .
look , i don &apos;t care .
you are out of the phone tech business , as of now .
how dare you come here .
emily ? i &apos;d ask you the same thing .
i &apos;m toby &apos;s friend .
well , there was a time you wanted to be more than that .
good thing he didn &apos;t feel the same way ,
or things would be awfully confusing
with maya , wouldn &apos;t they ?
you &apos;re lucky i don &apos;t take that stick .
mm , careful , emily .
misplaced anger can be dangerous .
misplaced ?
you should &apos;ve left him alone .
you all should &apos;ve left him alone .
you know how everyone close to you gets hurt .
are you threatening me , here , today ?
i &apos;m just stating a fact .
excuse me .
spencer .
hey , is spencer okay ?
i heard toby cavanaugh had a bad accident .
yeah . she &apos;s fine , but he broke his arm .
oh ! well , he &apos;s lucky .
yeah . seems like it .
so , are you , uh ,
still going on your date with holden tonight ?
mom , it &apos;s not a date . we &apos;re just old friends catching up .
is there a reason you have to go
all the way to philadelphia to catch up ?
yeah , i mean , holden &apos;s been , like ,
in the wilds of portugal .
i just figured his social skills
could use a little shock treatment .
so , where are you going ?
um , i think he said a place called macelli &apos;s .
oh , macelli &apos;s .
we haven &apos;t been there in years .
we stopped there with holden &apos;s family
on the way back from the cabin at clearlake .
oh , yeah ! yeah , i really liked that place .
how come we only went that one year ?
mm , well , your father hated that cabin ,
and he swore nothing could ever make him go back there .
really .
so , we should leave around seven ?
mom , really ? you &apos;re still driving me ?
come on , i &apos;m not 12 .
date or not , your father is insisting on closer supervision .
so am i.
okay .
jenna &apos;s right .
i &apos;m putting toby in danger ,
and i &apos;ve always known it .
we &apos;ve always done everything we can .
it &apos;s not enough . it &apos;ll never be enough .
i need you to do me a favor .
anything .
no , don &apos;t be so quick to agree .
if you do what i &apos;m about to ask you ,
you might end up hating me ,
but this is the only thing that i can think of to save toby .
what do you want me to do ?
told you , it &apos;s not that bad .
i &apos;ll be home tomorrow .
i &apos;ve been wanting to talk .
me too .
emily , what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s spencer .
what , is she okay ?
before you and she got together ,
she was seeing someone else .
it wasn &apos;t right , and she knew it .
but he &apos;s back now , and ...
what ?
it &apos;s not right again .
i don &apos;t ...
that &apos;s not possible .
why are you telling me this ?
because i can &apos;t watch you get hurt .
no . why are you telling me this ?
spencer couldn &apos;t .
she &apos;s been wanting to for a long time .
long time .
i &apos;m so sorry , toby .
tell me one thing .
who is it ?
okay , so i &apos;ll be back at 11 : 00 .
you kids enjoy yourselves .
okay . we will .
does it bother you , lying to her ?
of course .
but you do it anyway .
look , in this case ,
what she doesn &apos;t know isn &apos;t gonna hurt her .
what &apos;s going on ?
are you trying to convince me that we shouldn &apos;t be doing this ?
no , just making sure it &apos;s important to you .
why ? what difference does that make ?
because this is important to me .
oh , it is to me , too .
so , what do your friends think you &apos;re doing
when you &apos;re out with me ? lying to them , too ?
no , they know .
they are a little curious about you , though .
me ?
mm @-@ hmm .
you &apos;re a good @-@ looking guy .
you &apos;re pretending to go out with me
while you &apos;re sneaking off somewhere else ,
not telling me or your parents who you &apos;re really see--
oh ! so they think i &apos;m gay .
no .
yes .
no ! okay , yeah .
look , it &apos;s just--
aria , i &apos;m not . gay .
okay , well , what are you ?
late . see you at 11 : 00 .
bye .
i &apos;m just saying i put a lot of effort into my story .
i &apos;m not denying that . you &apos;re a good writer .
then why the &quot; b &quot; ?
i guess i found it a little unbelievable .
the guy leaves his fiancee at dinner
to follow a woman he only met five minutes ago .
he felt he had to get to know her .
he was at his rehearsal dinner .
he was getting married the next day .
exactly .
exactly what ?
true love saves him from making
the biggest mistake of his life .
do you think that &apos;s realistic ?
i think it &apos;s romantic .
life isn &apos;t always romantic .
sometimes it &apos;s realistic .
sometimes things don &apos;t work out the way you want them to .
we are still talking about my story ,
right , mr. fitz ?
yes . sorry .
i &apos;ll give it another look .
thank you .
i guess that &apos;s all i can ask for .
&quot; be bold ...
and mighty forces will come to your aid . &quot;
excuse me ?
it &apos;s a quote .
i forgot who said it ...
but that &apos;s what my story &apos;s about .
listen , i really don &apos;t want to think
about us being over , but ...
you know , whether we are or we aren &apos;t ,
it &apos;s something that we should discuss face to face .
so , meet me tonight at 8 : 00
in front of the clock by rittenhouse square .
if you come , it means that there &apos;s still a chance for us ,
and if not ...
删除
hmm . did you and the blender have a fight today ?
no , but caleb and i did .
oh . okay . you want to talk about it ?
not really .
i do .
it &apos;s nothing .
did you ever keep a secret from dad ?
well , apparently not as many as he kept from me .
yeah , i guess i kept a few .
like what ?
remember that time he surprised me
by painting our bedroom ?
yeah , that weird green color that looked like puke .
yeah , well ,
he was so proud of the job that he did .
i didn &apos;t have the heart to tell him i hated it .
anything bigger ?
once , steve anderson made a pass at me .
what ? mom , that &apos;s dad &apos;s best friend .
which is why i kept it a secret ...
after telling steve that i would spill it
if he ever tried it again .
but i knew your father well enough to know
that if i told him , it would hurt him .
and if i didn &apos;t , it wouldn &apos;t .
what &apos;s the big secret you &apos;re keeping from caleb ?
did you lie to him ?
no .
hanna .
it &apos;s nothing .
i have to go meet mona .
you feeling all right ?
something i can get you ?
just some answers .
yeah , sure . what &apos;s on your mind ?
you and spencer .
well , i kissed her . i &apos;m not gonna deny that .
big of you .
well , i was under the impression
that you two were over , so ...
did she tell you that ?
yeah , she did , actually .
you should go now .
come on , mate .
i &apos;m just saying , i may have broken my left arm ,
but my right arm is fine .
i can &apos;t wait to down a couple shots
and flush noel kahn out of my system .
wait , i thought you lost your fake i.d.
i &apos;ve got another one i could use from an old friend .
what ?
looks like somebody made a new friend .
double rebound , i guess .
don &apos;t take it so hard .
i &apos;m the one that just got dumped .
no . no , i get it . i just ...
i didn &apos;t expect to see those two hooking up .
come on , let &apos;s get out of here .
yeah .
i didn &apos;t know if you &apos;d come .
i didn &apos;t , either .
aria , this is dangerous for the both of us ...
i know .
but i &apos;m only worried about you .
i want you to be safe ,
to be happy ,
and i want you to be sure that this ,
that we , are what you want .
there &apos;s only one place where i can be sure of that .
where ?
with you .
we &apos;re crazy . you know that , right ?
i know .
so , how are we gonna do this ?
we can &apos;t spend the rest of our lives
on sidewalks in the rain .
i have an idea .
what do you mean , she destroyed the flash drive ?
i mean she vaporized it .
nothing left but smoke .
but why would she do that ?
that was the most important thing .
obviously it was important , okay ?
that &apos;s why i kept a copy of the files .
you did ?
yeah .
and i &apos;ll keep working on them , too ,
if we keep it a secret from hanna .
why ?
because i love her and i want to protect her ,
and it seems like finding out what &apos;s on that phone
is the best way to accomplish that .
no , i don &apos;t want to lie to hanna , caleb ,
and i don &apos;t want to lie to you .
yeah , about that .
if i &apos;m going to do this ,
i &apos;m gonna need something from you .
what ?
answers .
starting with what is it that hanna &apos;s so afraid of me finding ?
where &apos;s holden ?
he--
aria .
sorry , sorry ! aria really wanted dessert ,
but we didn &apos;t want to miss you , so i went myself .
you were off by a block , by the way .
oh ! my mistake .
you know me and my directions .
peanut butter and chocolate , right ?
uh @-@ huh . yeah . thank you .
coffee or vanilla ?
i went for the classics .
thank you .
so , what exactly did you tell him ?
as little as possible .
that jenna &apos;s trying to frame us
for alison &apos;s murder ,
that garrett &apos;s helping her ,
and that , despite what the police believe ,
ian &apos;s confession probably doesn &apos;t tell the whole story .
and then i figured the rest was something
that all of us needed to talk about .
all of us except hanna .
i don &apos;t feel any better about this than you do ,
but we did the right thing .
caleb knows what he has to know .
maybe what he got won &apos;t be any good ,
and we won &apos;t have to use him anymore .
so , we &apos;re hoping that nothing &apos;s on here ?
dance , you little bastards .
that &apos;s weird .
what ?
what &apos;s inside it ?
hey , shh ! someone &apos;s here .
alison ?
you &apos;re going down .
no , no , no .
we are all going down .
what ?
you taped us doing this ?
what the-- what is wrong with you ?
now we know why he hid the camera .
hey , once you &apos;re a member of the club ,
you &apos;re always a member of the club .
just making sure you &apos;re in as deep as i am .
she &apos;s coming upstairs !
that &apos;s alison about to walk in and find them .
this could be the last few seconds of her life .
i &apos;m not sure i want caleb to get any more .
yeah , but if he does ...
maybe we really can give this to the police .
maybe everything can finally be over .
over over ?
i thought toby was getting back from the hospital later today .
so did i.
where &apos;d he go ?
why would he leave the keys ?
spence , what does it say ?
