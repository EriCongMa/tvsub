you &apos;re late .
how many ?
three .
this is the second time in as many weeks .
everything was very polite -- a few questions , a few answers .
then things got contentious .
this business with your wife , this pursuit ,
it &apos;s pushing you in ways that i don &apos;t like .
don &apos;t start with me , kate .
i &apos;ll handle my business , you handle yours .
it &apos;s worboliski .
henryk .
it &apos;s warsam .
what happened ?
they were hit -- 20 minutes ago .
what do we know ?
professional crew . military precision .
six minutes in and out .
we have an inventory ?
safe @-@ deposit boxes popped , some cash missing .
they &apos;re running numbers now .
but you and i both know what they were after .
notify dubicki . see if he knows anything about the team .
i want a report within the hour .
interesting .
mr. kaplan , i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m out on the far end of the limb .
take a moment .
read a book .
you will find your wife .
oh , dear .
aw , hell .
第112号
hello , darling .
listen , you &apos;ve got it all wrong .
hurting me won &apos;t --
reddington doesn &apos;t care about me .
it -- it &apos;s why i &apos;m in hiding ,
is to protect my ch-- my child .
you know what ?
you have such beautiful mouth .
it &apos;s perfect .
lizzy !
i &apos;d like to introduce you
to my manicurist , rosa heredia .
she &apos;s the one i was telling you about , who was dating
that nine @-@ fingered bullfighter from juarez .
this woman is an artist ,
trained at the latin @-@ american school of medicine in havana .
medical school ?
trauma surgeon .
dropped out in the last year of her residency .
your ex @-@ wife -- have you found her ?
jennifer . what have you learned about jennifer ?
i confirmed your daughter was placed in protective custody
with her mother in 1990 .
the marshal service lost contact seven years ago .
she is unaccounted for .
monarch douglas bank .
what ?
the preferred bank of international criminals ,
dictators , terrorists , hedge @-@ fund managers .
they &apos;re headquartered here in the u.s. ,
deposits insured by the fdic , which places them firmly
within your agency &apos;s jurisdictional bailiwick .
they have branches in 63 countries ,
but their criminal operation
is run out of an unassuming little branch in warsaw .
and it is the last place on earth
that anyone would ever want to rob .
well , less than two hours ago ,
monarch &apos;s warsaw branch was assaulted .
what was stolen ?
according to the official statement , nothing .
and according to you ?
everything .
dante stewart , the notorious arms dealer ,
the juarez cartel , the entire marbella crime syndicate .
reddington claims these are just a few of the criminals
who funnel money through monarch douglas .
our contacts at treasury say monarch &apos;s records are spotless .
they &apos;re in ... full compliance .
despite that , according to reddington ,
they &apos;re legendary for laundering the money of the criminal elite
without any traceable accounting .
there has to be some kind of record .
that must be what they &apos;re looking for .
the ledger .
which is apparently more valuable
than the millions in assets they left lying in that vault .
well , the bank can &apos;t cooperate without implicating itself .
we take down monarch , we get the names
of every criminal who funnels money through them .
i &apos;ll contact our legal attaché in poland .
i want you and ressler on the next flight to warsaw .
yes , sir .
aram .
everything okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine . just ... missed my train .
what ?
what is it ?
it was at the front desk .
agent paul salerno .
agents ressler and keen .
we &apos;ve established joint cooperation with the locals ,
as well as standing extradition orders for any suspects charged ,
but while you are in @-@ country ,
you do not have the power to make arrests ,
and you will , of course , be unarmed .
we had a thorough briefing before we left .
hear you guys are part of some , uh , elite task force ?
where &apos;s the vault ?
the scene &apos;s still being processed .
we &apos;re just in time , then .
our sources said that nothing was reported stolen .
your sources were wrong .
matt strickland ,
e.v.p. of branch operations .
agents ressler and keen , fbi .
we understand you &apos;re headquartered in manhattan .
i flew out the minute i got the news .
our fault -- snafu in corporate communications .
the first press release was wrong .
they got away with over $ 400,000 in bearer bonds .
we &apos;re releasing a corrected statement first thing in the morning .
we need access to your data --
operating procedures , your employees .
of course . i &apos;ll make arrangements .
anything you need ...
i can assure you you &apos;ll have our complete cooperation .
thank you , mr. strickland .
if you &apos;ll excuse me .
the formula is missing . that means the money is missing .
clients are calling . they &apos;re concerned .
if we don &apos;t fix this now ...
we &apos;re all dead .
okay .
make me one .
colonel yusuf .
yusuf .
no inconsistencies in my witness statements .
they hacked the system , shut it down ,
deleted everything
back to a half @-@ hour before they hit .
what ?
traffic @-@ police services forwarded their feeds .
you got picture ?
yep .
but lousy angle , though . can &apos;t see what went down inside .
but they caught the bad guys coming in and going out .
i &apos;m mirroring the feed now . you seeing this ?
yeah . got it . go .
we got five unsubs .
not so fast .
check this out .
six .
i got six . is that right ?
yep . five went in , six came out .
uh , aram , can you zoom in on number 4 ?
copy that .
that &apos;s a woman .
she looks scared .
this wasn &apos;t a robbery . it was a kidnapping .
there was only one employee who swiped into the warsaw branch
the day of the incident who didn &apos;t swipe out --
kaja tomczak .
what can you tell us about her ?
nothing , i &apos;m afraid .
as e.v.p. , i typically have little contact
with branches of this size
and no contact with junior account managers .
before robbery , she went home sick .
she must have forgotten to swipe her card on way out .
oh . johnny @-@ on @-@ the @-@ spot .
had that one locked and chambered , did we ?
i &apos;m sorry -- i do not understand this &quot; johnny @-@ on @-@ the @-@ spot . &quot;
that &apos;ll do , kloza .
this is your american comedy ?
i &apos;m sorry , agent keen . tensions are running high .
we &apos;ve never been robbed before .
we &apos;re gonna need a copy of kaja tomczak &apos;s employee file .
of course .
the apartment is owned by monarch ?
yes -- this one , five , six more .
employees here on long business trips .
better than hotel .
did you know miss tomczak well ?
no .
was nice , very nice , but never spoke to her alone .
men are always with her .
men ?
walk her to the door , pick her up .
bring food , take her to work --
like guards .
always guards .
ressler .
yeah . we &apos;ll be right in .
they found the getaway van .
unsubs tried to torch it with some kind of accelerant .
fire burned itself out .
they should &apos;ve cracked a window .
hey , you guys see this up here ?
is that blood ?
i don &apos;t think so .
you know that &apos;s where people sit , right ?
smells like roses .
set a match to it -- see if it burns .
check if it &apos;s flammable .
what ? why ?
you got a light ?
yeah .
it &apos;s flammable .
jam .
from the heart of the rum @-@ soaked , rose @-@ petal paczki .
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t know what a rum @-@ soaked , rose--
it &apos;s a jelly doughnut .
lovely . now what ?
now ? nothing . just get some rest .
i &apos;ll be there in less than three hours .
then something .
the copper mine will have to wait .
we &apos;re going to warsaw .
your assets are safe . it &apos;s a minor systems problem .
i was told warsaw was hit .
completely unrelated .
this is an i.t. issue
that will be resolved within the next few hours .
i &apos;m waiting to take possession of vital cargo
that &apos;s now sitting in a container ship
just off the coast of mogadishu .
i can &apos;t get the cargo until i have a confirmation
of a wire transfer i made 36 hours ago .
and we would be more than happy to advance funds .
you talking about a loan ?
interest @-@ free , of course .
mr. strickland , i think you will come to new york
and i will talk to you face @-@ to @-@ face ,
you will answer all my questions
to my satisfaction , all right ?
no more food , suka .
raymond !
apolonia .
my darling .
and dembe .
how is my sweet , gentle boy ?
i &apos;ve been dreaming of paczki .
i tried to curb my cravings
in this little shop in the west village in new york ,
but they fill them with prune jelly .
can you imagine ?
idiota .
tastes just like patty sutton .
i must admit , moj droga , i have ulterior motives --
little business .
sales up , business good .
i finish inventory .
then you have something nice to pick from .
and maybe something for my little favorite , too .
my grandmother used to keep flour in the refrigerator .
why is that ?
to keep the weevils out .
oh , of course -- weevils .
it &apos;s come to my attention
that the monarch douglas bank was robbed yesterday
by some of your ... customers .
and if your customers come under scrutiny , apolonia ,
your business comes under scrutiny .
moj boze .
god can &apos;t protect you .
but i can .
rece do góry ! hands in the air !
kaja tomczak . fbi .
what are you doing here ?
good to see you , too .
you &apos;re safe now .
i was safe before you got here .
i was trying to escape .
what &apos;s the rendezvous point ?
the safe house just across the river .
we &apos;re sending you the address now .
agent salerno &apos;s on his way .
head toward the vistula river .
and her associates ? have you identified them ?
a warsaw gang called the mayerchak group ,
known for armed robbery and money laundering .
rough trade for a bank clerk .
get her statement -- i want to know everything she knows
before this extradition deal blows up .
if the police know where i am ,
so does strickland .
we &apos;re doing a threat assessment .
you money men , you love military terms .
your tactics , strategies ,
your campaigns and hostile takeovers , huh ?
now , you promised me that this would all be resolved by now ,
and it isn &apos;t .
do you think i would have flown to new york ,
met with you personally
if i wasn &apos;t confident in our handling of the situation ?
the situation is fluid .
you need to be patient .
i like you , mr. strickland .
i like the way you and your people do business .
but i need you to understand -- if you bungle this ,
the people i &apos;m working with ,
they expect me to set an example --
to peel you like a grape .
and i can assure you , as your banker ,
that your assets are protected by the formula .
the formula .
tell me -- how does she do it ?
it &apos;s called hyperthymesia --
highly superior autobiographical memory .
like a photographic memory .
it &apos;s why the bank hired me --
so there wouldn &apos;t be any paper trail .
pick a day -- any day , any year .
december 21 , 2010 .
it was a tuesday .
i had dry toast for breakfast , bigos for lunch .
i picked up a copy of the fakt .
two earthquakes -- one in japan , bonin islands ,
another in iran , 6.5 .
there was a lunar eclipse .
that &apos;s incredible .
it could not be seen here , but ...
anything interesting ?
she drained the accounts
of every criminal who had money at that bank .
she keeps it all in her head . that &apos;s how the bank does it .
she can give us account numbers , amounts .
who are our friends ?
i &apos;m not taking any chances
until she &apos;s safely turned over to the local police .
out of the question . she &apos;s coming back to the states .
you don &apos;t make that call .
agent harold cooper already did . perhaps you &apos;d like to spe--
a sheet of paper ,
i @-@ i don &apos;t just look at it and remember every word .
i relive it -- the temperature of the room , the light .
the cameras in your apartment , the guards ...
they were watching you .
for my protection .
then ...
you became the prisoner .
ressler ! !
i staged it at the bank
to ensure there &apos;d be an investigation .
ressler !
it &apos;s over , pal .
who do you work for ?
you don &apos;t understand the national @-@ security implications
of what that woman knows and the damage she can do .
they &apos;re coming !
who the hell are you ?
samar navabi -- mossad .
you &apos;re outgunned .
go . i &apos;ll cover you .
how do we know we can trust you ?
go !
what was that back there ? ! you almost got me killed !
sorry -- wasn &apos;t expecting
the mirror to explode 3 feet from my face .
guess it took me a few seconds to regroup .
more than a few . your reaction time was crap .
bullet fragment .
must have passed through the house on our way out .
okay , i know , i know , i know . just stay still . stay still .
it &apos;s bad ?
yeah , it &apos;s bad .
you know i can hear everything you &apos;re saying ? !
okay .
okay . good , good , good , good , good .
you &apos;re not going to --
i need you to stay still , okay ?
on the count of three , all right ?
one ...
what is it ?
it &apos;s my stomach .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so sick .
bathroom ?
please .
what &apos;s going on ? why are we stopping ?
they &apos;re watching every move . we got to get out of here .
uh , w @-@ where do we go ?
how do we get out of here
if they &apos;re monitoring the streets , the sidewalks ?
what do you mean you &apos;re in a stolen car ?
we had to !
salerno &apos;s dirty . the safe house was assaulted by a tac team .
and why the hell are we being trailed by mossad ? !
say again ?
samar navabi ?
she took down salerno , covered our escape .
but kaja &apos;s been shot .
listen to me -- you two need to ditch the car ,
dump your phones , and get off the grid right now .
where &apos;s the nearest landline to their current location ?
okay , uh , four blocks ahead ,
corner of stalowa and srodkowa .
find it . i &apos;ll call you there in 10 .
got it .
who the hell is samar navabi ?
mrs. reddington ! enough is enough !
there &apos;s no escape !
and the more time we waste ,
the harder it &apos;s gonna be for you when we find you !
cooper ?
harold tells me the local police may not be your greatest ally .
get us out of here .
i &apos;ve reached out to an old friend for assistance .
kaspar dubicki &apos;s my man in warsaw .
he &apos;s waiting for you under the swietokrzyski bridge --
2.1 / 2 kilometers east of your current position .
2.1 / 2 kilometers is a world away .
there are a million dirty cops between here and there ,
and they &apos;re all after her .
i &apos;ve arranged for a small diversion .
just get to dubicki .
can we trust him ?
no .
you can trust me .
tell reddington it is done .
yeah -- big boom .
it &apos;s clear .
the tracks run all the way to the bridge .
all right . hang on .
mrs. reddington !
you &apos;re a clever girl .
keep that down .
take these . it &apos;ll help with the pain .
thank you .
account number 924386 .
shell company is gonzalez cargo .
what are you doing ?
dying declaration .
no .
you &apos;re not dying -- not today .
i wasn &apos;t always a prisoner .
in the beginning , the bank paid me --
gave me apartment , a car .
i knew what they were doing --
terrorist cartels , organized crime .
but i looked the other way .
i helped them stay in business .
i &apos;m no better than they are .
what the hell ?
we &apos;ve got to be 10 minutes out .
reddington . how did you --
enough with the guns .
i love trains . my grandfather rode the rails .
have you ever seen &quot; the general &quot; ?
buster keaton ?
oh , my goodness .
what are you doing ?
dubicki said the bridge was swarming with police .
we need to move quickly .
and kaja ?
quite safe , i assure you .
on her way to my gulfstream .
i &apos;ll arrange for an onboard medic to tend to her wounds .
we &apos;ll be wheels @-@ up in 20 .
i &apos;ve also booked the two of you first @-@ class tickets home .
no , you can &apos;t take her ! no !
guys , guys .
enough with the pointing .
don &apos;t worry , donald . they won &apos;t shoot you .
but they will restrain you -- rigorously if necessary .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have business to attend to .
be sure they make their flight .
no . no , no .
come on .
let &apos;s make some music ?
yes ?
it &apos;s him .
yeah , hello ?
i think it &apos;s time we met .
布鲁克林 纽约
this has been a long time coming .
i hope it &apos;s been worth it .
what a terrible waste .
time , blood , money .
and in the end , for what ?
revenge .
that &apos;s my passion .
revenge isn &apos;t a passion -- it &apos;s a disease
that eats at your mind and poisons your soul .
i attended summer camp
with this little stick of a girl -- twila stansberry .
hell of an athlete -- capture the flag .
had an unrelenting passion for fitness .
never skinny enough -- a pound here , a pound there .
ran like a deer .
until she couldn &apos;t -- could barely walk .
turns out she was anorexic .
the disease caused her to lose her sight .
i &apos;ve never known anyone more obsessed with their body than twila .
spent her entire life chasing something that destroyed her .
make sure your passion isn &apos;t your sickness .
your wife is coming apart nicely .
we have a common enemy .
who ?
whoever told you that i killed your daughter .
you are finished with my wife .
think so ?
yes , you are .
i have something
i suspect you value far more than revenge --
your money .
what you &apos;re telling me
is we have totally lost control of the situation .
reddington and the witness are gone .
berlin -- gone . red &apos;s wife -- gone .
can any of you tell me one thing
that we &apos;ve got going for us at this point ? !
coffee machine still works .
at least it &apos;s finally clear now who our perpetrator really is .
is it ?
illuminate me .
reddington .
he &apos;s the one who put the spotlight on monarch douglas .
my guess is , because he had significant funds on deposit .
and once he identified kaja as their human hard drive ...
he put us on her trail ,
had us deliver her into his custody .
reddington double @-@ crossed us .
no . he &apos;s up to something else .
we need to find that girl , find out where she &apos;s being held .
she &apos;s wounded -- reddington &apos;s going to need
to find her a doctor , someone he can trust .
rosa heredia .
who ?
his manicurist .
manicurist ?
well , she was trained as a surgeon .
of course she was .
find her -- now .
i have the girl .
and because i have her ,
i have control of all your assets at monarch douglas .
i &apos;ve transferred every penny into a numbered ,
thoroughly untraceable escrow account .
you &apos;re broke .
listen .
hear that ?
that &apos;s the sound of your checks bouncing --
from here to st. petersburg , from bangkok to mozambique .
so , my proposal --
your money for my wife .
you can give her back and we can continue this war ,
or you can kill my wife and i keep your money .
i almost gave up looking for you .
you were like a ghost for 12 years .
heard rumors .
and i followed them --
from barcelona to melbourne to stockholm .
but always nothing .
until one day ...
i made a connection .
elizabeth keen .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re sitting here today --
because of keen .
i know you care for her as much as you care for your wife .
i think underneath it all , under that hat of yours ,
you &apos;re not much different from , uh , twila stansberry .
you have the power to destroy me ,
but you &apos;re offering me a way out
because you &apos;re blinded by passion .
guess we both are .
have your associates set up the meeting .
okay ?
hey , rosa .
we know you &apos;re treating kaja .
where &apos;s your patient ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know --
i came alone . i don &apos;t want to have to call for backup .
lizzy . how was your flight ?
i know what you &apos;re trying to pull ,
and it &apos;s not gonna happen .
what i &apos;m trying to pull ?
is that how we speak to each other now --
as if i &apos;m some kind of cheap , dime @-@ store confidence man ?
bank robber , embezzler , thief .
you put us on this case so you could get to the girl
so you could steal berlin &apos;s money .
once she left the bank , the girl was vulnerable .
i simply took advantage of an opportunity .
you &apos;re gonna use her to get your wife back .
storybook ending .
not for the thousands of people
who are gonna lose their lives because of his actions .
this man is a psychopath !
that money is going to fund terror all over the world ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let that happen
for the sake of one woman .
you don &apos;t have a vote .
i found kaja .
she gave you the routing numbers .
we froze the escrow accounts where you parked berlin &apos;s cash .
my wife will die .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , you &apos;re not -- not yet .
maybe someday , if you &apos;re very lucky ,
you might wonder ,
&quot; at exactly what point did i become this ... thing ? &quot;
but not now . right now , you &apos;re just doing your job .
don &apos;t go through with it . we can find another way .
the deal is moving forward .
you can &apos;t hold up your end . he &apos;ll kill you .
wish me luck .
my wife .
give him the codes .

$ 6.7 million on deposit
from the fbi wichita field office .
it &apos;s linked to agent salerno .
he was laundering money through that bank .
there is no such person .
the bureau uses monarch to finance sanctioned operations ,
including this one .
we &apos;re funded through monarch .
you will purge all records of his role in this matter .

you &apos;re right .

this is very thorough .
i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;d be willing to share your sources --
how you came by this information ?
i followed leads ,
exploited a few hairline fractures
in the wall that surrounds your operation .
most of it , i gathered myself .
and the rest ?
what do you want ?
your door was open .
yes .
thank you .
you &apos;re an asset i &apos;m charged with protecting .
i transferred the money to keep you safe .
i was just doing my job .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , every life
that that psycho takes from this point forward
is on you .
i hope she &apos;s worth it .
it &apos;s funny .
when i was standing there
wondering if you had decided to let me die ,
a thought struck me --
how did you know that berlin had his money in that bank ?
at first , i thought it was the girl -- that she told you .
but the accounts would be coded ,
moved through shell corporations --
layers of protection .
and then i realized , &quot; no .
&quot; somebody has a secret santa .
a source . &quot;
bravo , lizzy .
when you &apos;re ready to share , i &apos;d love to hear .
♬ take my mind and take my pain ♬
how do we know
kaja gave up all the accounts at monarch ?
what would possibly motivate her to do otherwise ?
a new identity when this is all over --
a sizeable contribution to her pension
in exchange for protecting you and your friends .
lizzy , don &apos;t be absurd . i don &apos;t have any friends .
