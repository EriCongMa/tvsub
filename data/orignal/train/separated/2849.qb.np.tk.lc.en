monica ?
what time is it ?
nine .
but it &apos;s dark out .
that &apos;s because you always sleep till noon , silly .
this is what nine looks like .
i guess i &apos;ll get washed up then .
watch that sunrise .
i &apos;m getting tired of always sneaking around .
me too .
what if we went away for the weekend ? no interruptions .
we could be naked the entire time .
all weekend ? that &apos;s a whole lot of naked .
i &apos;ll say i have a conference and you can have a chef thing .
i wanted to go to this culinary fair in jersey !
okay . you know you &apos;re not , though .
let &apos;s go .
okay . wait.what about joey ?
the one with the kips
hey , guess what i &apos;m doing this weekend !
i &apos;m going to a culinary fair in jersey this weekend .
how weird ! chandler just said he &apos;s got a conference there .
that &apos;s funny .
seems like chandler &apos;s conference could &apos;ve been ... in connecticut or vermont .
i &apos;m not in charge of where the conference is held .
do you want people to think it &apos;s fake ? it &apos;s a real conference .
ls rachel here ? i gotta talk to her
no , she &apos;s out shopping .
damn !
what &apos;s going on ? -i told emily to come .
and i just need to , you know , talk to rachel about it .
wait a minute .
when emily comes , you won &apos;t see rachel anymore ?
i &apos;m focusing on the &quot; i get to see my wife &quot; part ...
... and not on the part that makes me do this .
so you &apos;ll never be in a room together ?
how will that even work ?
i have no idea . i mean ....
but i assure you , i will figure it out .
it doesn &apos;t seem like it &apos;ll work .
hi , guys .
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re flipping monica &apos;s mattress .
so i &apos;m thinking , basically , we pick it up and then we flip it .
that &apos;s better than my way .
hey guys , would you flip mine too ?
oh , man .
oh , look ! a letter from my mom .
so , rach ? you know how emily &apos;s coming ?
oh , yeah . i know .
can you hear anything ?
yeah , somebody just said , &quot; can you hear anything ? &quot;
hey , joey &apos;s ass .
what are you doing ?
remember when they fought and broke up ... and we were stuck here all night with no food ?
when ross said &quot; rachel &quot; at the wedding , i figured it &apos;d happen again .
so i hid this in here .
candy bars , crossword puzzles ....
mad libs ! mine !
okay , &quot; name of someone in room . &quot;
chandler .
come on , seriously .
what do you got in here ? magazines , doritos
condoms ?
you don &apos;t know how long we &apos;ll be in here .
we may have to repopulate the earth .
and condoms are the way to do that ?
anyway , it all boils down to this .
the last time i talked to emily
oh , my god ! our dog died !
what ?
oh , my god ! lapooh , our dog !
lapooh &apos;s still alive ?
sorry .
it says he was hit by an ice cream truck
and dragged for ... nineteen blocks !
oh , my god .
sweetie , we heard you crying.please don &apos;t cry .
it &apos;s lapooh !
i know , it &apos;s lapooh right now but it &apos;ll get better .
i can &apos;t believe it ! we &apos;re here !
chocolates on the pillows ! i love that !
you should live with joey . rolos everywhere .
this is so great . no one &apos;s gonna bother us .
and we &apos;re gonna do it .
i &apos;m gonna do it with monica !
chandler ,
chandler , stop yelling that you and i are gonna do it !
i &apos;ll be right back .
okay .
oh , yes ! get in here . there &apos;s a high @-@ speed car chase on !
we &apos;re switching rooms .
oh , dear god ! they gave us glasses !
the glasses have lipstick on them .
who knows what else they didn &apos;t change ?
you wanna switch rooms because they didn &apos;t switch the glasses ?
i didn &apos;t wanna say anything , but the carpet smells too .
i want this weekend to be perfect .
we can change rooms , can &apos;t we ?
okay , but let &apos;s do it now . chopper five just lost its feed !
forget it .
you know how there was something i wanted to talk to you about ?
oh , yeah .
i &apos;m trying to work things out with emily .
well , there &apos;s this ... one thing .
here goes .
i made a promise that
what ?
your nose is bleeding .
oh , god !
you &apos;re bleeding.oh , not again .
this happened when my grandfather died .
sorry .
gross.okay. so i &apos;m sorry . what did you want to tell me ?
sorry . sorry .
i can &apos;t see you anymore .
i know , it &apos;s ridiculous . i can &apos;t see you , either . all right .
i &apos;m just gonna go shove a bunch of tissues in my nose .
hey , do you wanna tell me while i do that ?
i &apos;m good .
i think you &apos;ll like this room more .
okay , great .
they say he &apos;s only got half a tank left .
half a tank ? still lots of high @-@ speed chasing to do !
i &apos;ll bet he &apos;s heading for canada
they always do .
we &apos;re switching rooms again .
what ?
why ?
this has a garden view . we paid for an ocean view .
our last ocean @-@ view room was unacceptable to you .
the carpet smelled .
like ocean ?
no , like feet .
excuse me . can i talk to you over here for just a second ?
chandler ! -ya
these clowns want to take us for a ride . i won &apos;t let them .
we &apos;re not a couple of suckers .
i hear you , mugsy .
all these rooms are fine.just pick one so i can watch the
have a perfect , magical weekend together with you ?
oh , man , he almost hit a gas truck .
do you ever watch baywatch ?
this one i like .
nothing . nothing . it &apos;s over . damn it !
this is regularly scheduled programming !
i wanted to see them talk to his neighbors .
well , i &apos;m standing right here ... you could talk to me .
you didn &apos;t know him .
can we turn the tv off ?
do we really want to spend the weekend like this ?
am i getting in the way of the room @-@ switching fun ?
don &apos;t blame me for tonight.who should i blame ?
the nice bellman who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms ?
i don &apos;t know
how about the idiot who thought he could drive ... from albany to canada on half a tank of gas ?
do not speak ill of the dead .
we &apos;re supposed to be spending a romantic weekend together .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i just want to watch a little television.what is the big deal ?
jeez , relax , mom .
what did you say ?
i said , &quot; jeez , relax , mon . &quot;
you know what , chandler ? you like fast getaways ? watch this .
i don &apos;t like fast getaways , i like car chases .
hey .
i &apos;ve been wanting to tell you something
and i just have to get it out .
okay . what &apos;s up ?
okay , before i tell you i just have to know ... is your nose okay ?
are all the other family pets in good health ?
well , davey &apos;s still pining after lapooh ...
... but , you know , he &apos;s a tough little turtle .
you know how you said to do whatever it takes to fix my marriage ?
yeah , i told you to give emily whatever she wants .
and while that was good advice , you should know that what she wants ...
yes ?
is for me not to see you anymore .
that &apos;s crazy ! you can &apos;t do that .
what are you going to tell her ?
oh , my god ! you &apos;ve already agreed to this .
it &apos;s awful , i know .
but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work .
and i do . i have to make this marriage work . i have to .
but the good thing is , we can still see each other until she gets here .
lucky me !
oh , my god ! that is good news , ross !
that &apos;s the best news i &apos;ve heard since lapooh died !
you have no idea what a nightmare this has been .
this is so hard .
oh , yeah , really ? is it , ross ?
let me make this easier for you .
what are you doing ? storming out .
it &apos;s your apartment .
yeah ? well , that &apos;s how mad i am !
damn rolos !
you &apos;re back !
how was your conference ?
it was terrible . i fought with my colleagues the entire time .
are you kidding with this ?
so your weekend was a bust ?
no , i got to see donald trump waiting for an elevator .
you know , at the taj mahal he has his own private glass elevator .
that &apos;s right . made by otis elevators .
and they don &apos;t usually do glass .
what kinds of stuff do you know ?
hi
you &apos;re back too .
ya ! chandler , could i talk to you for a second ?
how was your chef thing ?
lt was awful .
some people don &apos;t appreciate good food .
maybe the food tasted good at first ...
... but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea .
chandler !
monica
how much was the room ? i &apos;ll pay my half .
fine . $ 300 .
$ 300 ?
just think of it as $ 25 per room .
what are you guys woofing about ?
chandler stole a 20 from my purse !
no
i was only stealing it back , the one that she stole from me .
stealing and now lying .
you know what ? now that i think about it ... i constantly find myself without 20s , and you always have lots .
you should &apos;ve seen the look on her face .
i don &apos;t want rachel to hate me . i don &apos;t know what to do .
you want my advice ?
yes . please .
you won &apos;t like it .
that &apos;s okay .
you got married too fast .
that &apos;s not advice .
i told you .
i &apos;m going to the bathroom .
if anyone asked me to give up any of you , i couldn &apos;t do it .
me neither .
maybe i could do it .
i know you guys heard about me and ross .
but i &apos;ve been obsessing about it and would love not to talk about it .
i don &apos;t know if this falls under that category ...
... but ross is right back there .
that &apos;s not ross . -not that guy .
he does look like him , though .
ross is in the bathroom .
oh , my god ! it &apos;s happening . it &apos;s already started .
i &apos;m kip .
yeah , you &apos;re not kip .
do you even know who kip is ?
who cares ? you &apos;re rachel .
who &apos;s kip ?
my old roommate . we all hung out together .
oh , that poor bastard .
you told me the story .
he and monica dated.when they broke up ,
you all promised you &apos;d stay his friend.and what happened ?
he got phased out .
you won &apos;t be phased out .
of course i am.it won &apos;t happen to ross . he &apos;s your brother ,
your college roommate .
kip didn &apos;t even have to be kip .
we handled that all wrong .
it was a long time ago .
and it was before you and me were around .
they didn &apos;t know what they were doing .
chandler had a mustache , for crying out loud .
it was just a matter of time.i just always assumed phoebe would be the one to go .
honey , come on ! you live far away , you &apos;re not related .
you lift right out .
hey , mr. bing .
that hotel you stayed at called .
someone left an eyelash curler in your room .
yes , that was mine .
i figured you met a girl and she left it .
that would have made more sense .
i don &apos;t even feel like i know you anymore .
all right , i &apos;m just going to ask you this one time .
whatever you say , i &apos;ll believe you .
were you or were you not ... on a gay cruise ?
phoebe
i &apos;m sorry about the whole &quot; lifting out &quot; thing .
you gotta come with me .
where ?
wherever i go .
you and me , we &apos;ll start a new group . we &apos;re the best ones .
okay , but try to get joey too .
phoebe , do you mind if l speak to rachel alone ?
sure .
bye , ross .
forever .
hi
what are you doing here ?
isn &apos;t this against the rules ?
i talked to monica .
look , i &apos;m the one who made the choice .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s making things change .
so i should be the one to , you know , step back .
no , no , it &apos;s okay . really .
plenty of people just see their sisters at thanksgiving ... their college roommates at reunions
... and joey at burger king .
is that better ?
no , it &apos;s not better .
i still don &apos;t get to see you .
what would you do ? if you were me , what would you do ?
well , first , i &apos;d have said the right name at my wedding .
i can &apos;t believe this .
i know .
i am so sorry .
i know that too .
hey , rach ? sorry to interrupt ,
but phoebe said you want to talk to me about a trip ?
hey
hi
i just came over to drop off ... nothing .
so that weekend kind of sucked .
yeah , it did .
so i guess this is over ?
what ?
you know , you and me . i mean , it had to end sometime .
why exactly ?
because of the weekend . we had a fight .
chandler , that &apos;s crazy .
if you always gave up after a fight ... you &apos;d never be with anyone longer than
oh
this isn &apos;t over ?
you are so cute !
no , no . it was a fight .
you deal with it and you move on .
it &apos;s nothing to freak out about .
really ? okay , great !
welcome to an adult relationship .
we &apos;re in a relationship ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
okey
hey
i heard you saw donald trump at your convention .
saw him waiting for an elevator .
can i use your eyelash curler ? i lost mine .
it &apos;s in the bathroom .
can i talk to you for a second ?
yes.yes.
you ? and you ?
but you cannot tell anyone . no one knows .
but how ? when ?
lt happened in london .
ln london !
the reason we didn &apos;t tell anyone because we didn &apos;t want to make a big deal out of it .
but it is a big deal !
i have to tell someone !
no ... you can &apos;t .
please . now , i know this is hard .
lt is . it hurts .
we just don &apos;t want to deal with telling everyone .
please just promise you won &apos;t tell .
all right .
man , this is unbelievable !
i mean , it &apos;s great ! but ....
i know . it &apos;s great !
i don &apos;t want to see that !
we &apos;re so stupid .
do you know what &apos;s going on in there ?
they &apos;re trying to take joey !
&quot; the most popular phoebe in tennis is called the overhand phoebe .
if you win , slap your opponent on the phoebe and say , &apos; hi , phoebe ! &apos; &quot;
that &apos;s cute . we really all enjoyed it .
but it doesn &apos;t count .
for what ?
just count in our heads as good mad libs .
i gotta go .
fun &apos;s over .
wait , if we follow the rules ... it &apos;s still fun and it means something .
i &apos;m going to take off .
