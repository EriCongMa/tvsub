Watch me make a girl disappear.
Kisses, A.
Where's Emily?
Hurry up!
Two of them?
Help me!
Cece!
This is what Ali wanted us to see.
There are two payments made to Cece Drake last week.
Maybe "A" paid her to dress up as red coat.
I think "A" is a guy.
It looks like he's followed her trail to Ravenswood.
I don't like the idea of you guys being there alone.
I'm not waiting for Toby.
You need to leave Ravenswood.
You're being watched.
He's hoping you'll lead him to Alison.
Ali's still alive?
We're crashing a party.
What kind of town throws a party in a graveyard?
Must be to honor their dead.
Yeah, they can't do that without walking all over them?
Guys, what if we see "A" before we find Alison?
There's four of us there's only one of him.
Um, yeah, but that him might be carrying a weapon.
All we've got are these 20-pound hats.
Well, I can't run from the enemy.
This girdle is cutting off my air supply.
It's a corset.
It's torture.
People really wore this crap?
I'm never complaining again about a sports bra.
Wait.
I can't do this.
Emily? We have to get to Alison before "A" does.
We can't back off.
It's not just "A" I'm scared of.
I don't know if I'm ready to see Alison.
Em, we already have.
Come on.
Man, people have been croaking in this town a long time.
It happens.
What are those?
Are those fingers?
They're mushrooms. Aria, get a grip.
Hanna?
Hey, stay with us.
Wait, hold on.
Wait, it's Ezra. He might be worried about me.
Just don't tell him too much.
Hey, there.
Hey. I've been trying to reach you. Where are you?
Uh, look, it's actually not a great time to talk.
I'm standing in a graveyard.
You're what?
I'm in Ravenswood. But I'll call you later, okay?
Aria? You need to be careful.
Yeah, I will. I promise. Bye.
Come on.
Got anything to eat?
Gum? Mint? Cough drop?
No.
I mean, I do. In my car.
You have a car? Why are you on the bus?
Why are you sitting next to me?
It's not like it's standing room only.
Well, when I got on, I went to the back.
But the dude in Row 26 was creeping me out.
So, I tried sitting next to the driver,
but he doesn't have any food and I'm starving.
Sorry. I didn't pack a picnic.
I wasn't expecting to be on this bus.
Yeah, me neither. I had to change in Harrisburg.
This freak on the last one was so annoying.
Kept telling me he looked like Ryan Gosling
in certain light.
And I'm like, "dude, carry that light with you,
because in this light, you look like Shrek."
So, where are you headed?
Ravenswood.
Me, too.
You got friends there?
No, um, family.
But I haven't met them-- him--yet.
I didn't even know my uncle existed until two weeks ago.
Your parents never--
They're gone.
Gone?
Dead.
So, the creep in 26 fell asleep
and he has a huge bag of chips.
Do you think we can get away with stealing them?
Well, unless 60 people get on at the next stop...
I'd say we look pretty good for it.
Yeah.
So, does he know you're coming? Your uncle?
Yeah, of course he does.
He's the only family I have.
So, then, who're you living with now?
It's complicated.
Foster home?
You don't have to say it like that.
You're not gonna catch something
because we're sharing a seat.
Hey, if there's something to catch, I've already got it.
I've spent some time in a few of them myself.
So, um, are you running away?
I'm stealing those chips.
Why would Ali come to a party like this?
Who knows?
Maybe it has something to do with Mrs. Grunwald.
You guys, look.
Right over there. Do you see him?
See who?
The dude standing by himself.
He's wearing that vintage uniform.
Hanna, don't stare!
Do you want me to look or not?
Oh, my God. Is that board shorts?
What do we do now?
We go up there and ask the scumbag if he's A.
Hanna!
What? It's crazy.
We've never even seen him before.
Why would a total stranger be after us?
Who knows if he's a stranger to Alison?
Or Mona? Or Jenna? Or Melissa?
He's not alone anymore.
You guys stay here. I wanna hear what they're saying.
Keep looking for Ali.
Okay.
Names?
If that's the creep who's been messing with Ali
and the rest of us, we need answers.
Let's go talk to her.
What are you doing here?
W-we thought we'd try and find other people in town
who might've had contact with Ali, or--
or what?
You need to leave. Now. All of you.
What happened?
He's a light sleeper.
Hanna, why aren't you answering your phone?
Call me, please.
Who's Hanna?
My girlfriend.
You guys had some kind of fight?
No. I'm...
Angry at myself
because I let her go there.
Go where?
Ravenswood.
You worried she's hooking up with somebody else?
No, that is not what I'm worried about.
Well, hey, don't sweat it.
If we get there and both get kicked to the curb,
we meet on the next bus out.
Does your uncle know you're coming?
Did you at least give him a heads up?
Why? So he could slam the door shut
before he even opens it?
I just... he might want some--
Look, don't worry about me, okay?
I have other places to go. Just worry about Hanna.
Are you okay?
Oh, I think so.
Did somebody push you in there?
That guy that grabbed you inside,
did he push you in--
No. That was my cousin.
He's not the one who's behind this.
Leah!
Was is it? What happened to you?
She fell. I guess. I was just helping her out.
You fell?
I told you it wasn't safe here.
Thanks, again.
How could you lose both of them?
I told you, I got jumped by Mrs. Grunwald.
What the hell was that?
Hey? Where have you been?
Well, I thought you guys were right behind me.
I thought you were behind me.
Well, I was behind two little girls who were freaking me out.
I still haven't seen their faces.
Can we please go back to the tent?
Guys, I don't think scary uniform
is board shorts.
That's not his girlfriend, that's his cousin.
There's something seriously weird going on in this town.
Uh, gee, you think?
They're using headstones for barstools.
Why were they wearing red coats?
Who?
Those twins.
Why do we care? We're here to find Alison, remember?
Ali's was the one who told us about that blonde twin
who stabbed her sister--
Can we not tell ghost stories
while we're walking through a graveyard?
Is that Ali?
Where did she go? You saw her, right?
Yeah, we all did.
Well, then, where is she?
Okey, I don't get it.
We are what? Like ten seconds behind her?
How did "A" get her out of here without us seeing it?
I'm officially losing this flying saucer.
Guys, look.
There's no leaves there.
Yeah.
Where does this even go?
Um... hell? Just a guess.
Who did that?
Come on, we'll find another way.
How?
This has got to lead somewhere.
Well, hopefully it leads to your car.
Spence, I want to go home.
Okay, breathe.
We'll find another door.
Does anyone else have a signal?
No. I have minus three bars.
How old is this place?
Where's that wind coming from?
There must be an open door somewhere. Keep walking.
What's going on?
Hold on! Get against the wall!
Hold on, hold on to me.
What is that?
God, ow!
Hanna, are you...
Where's Hanna?
She was right behind you, wasn't she?
Hanna? Hanna?
Where did she go?
Hanna?
Look, I'm sorry.
I was just asking about your uncle because...
I've been there.
You crash into somebody's life like a cannonball,
and there might be an explosion.
I've got an uncle, too,
who turned out to be my father.
Are you living with him now?
No.
You know, and if that is what you're expecting, don't.
Okay, get the picket fence and the bedroom
with your own door out of your head.
I'd settle for someone
who wouldn't toss my laptop into a steaming bathtub.
Were you in it?
No. Not that she would've noticed.
She's the kind who
opens a bottle of vodka and throws away the cap.
Well, then this was a good call.
Maybe things'll work out.
At least you know where you're going.
Yeah. Back to Scranton.
Rather deal with the devil I know.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
I mean, you are closer to Ravenswood--
Look, I gotta go.
But have a nice life.
Um, what's your name?
Caleb.
Miranda.
Bye.
On second thought.
Emily! God, where are you guys?
Spence, where are you?
Hello?
Oh, my god.
Ali? Ali, is that you?
Oh, my god!
Come on, come on.
Total worth passing the graveyard,
but I didn't know you could bring a band.
Go ahead, find your girlfriend. I'll be okay.
You know, I can walk you to your uncle's house.
The driver said that it was down that street.
No, I can find it myself. You're late.
To tell you the truth, I'd rather face him alone.
How I'm used to doing things.
Yeah, well, You have my number, so...
You've got mine.
Let me know what happens.
Yeah. Promise.
What was that?
Keeps evil spirits away.
Never heard that one.
I just made it up.
See you 'round the bus stop.
Right.
Hanna! Can you hear me?
Why did you let go of her?
I didn't.
I held on to her the whole time.
Until you grabbed a statue.
Guys, I didn't let go of her.
Even if she let go, why would she just leave like that?
She wouldn't.
What is that?
A has the both of them, doesn't he?
Come on.
Stupid phone.
This is not happening. This is seriously not happening.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Hello?
Listen to me, I need help...
Hello?
Hanna?
A door in a crypt
that leads to a tunnel that comes up inside a mansion.
What kind of zoning laws does this town have?
It could be from the prohibition,
maybe even the underground railroad.
That's just rusty water, right?
They'll find out.
My friends know I'm here.
Ali?
Where did Spencer go?
Ah, come on!
Ali?
Hello.
Hi.
You live here?
My uncle does.
Or, at least, I think he does.
That's who I was looking for when I found you.
Who else lives in this house?
How should I know?
Well, there were people running in the hall.
You must have seen them.
The only person I've met in this house is you. And you are?
Why should I tell you?
Because I'm the one who let you out of the phone booth.
How do I know you're not the one who locked me in the phone booth?
You could be from here, maybe you're trying to kill me.
If I was going to kill you,
I'd use something better than a phone booth.
My name's Hanna.
Hanna. I'm Miranda.
Okay, this is going to sound crazy,
But I've got one friend in this house
And there are people trying to hurt her.
And I've got some other friends who were
trying to save the first friend, but then we all got separated in the tunnel
and now I got locked in a phone booth.
And what's the crazy part?
Just let's get out of here and go find my friends.
Okay.
You do know how to get out of here, don't you?
I mean, you got in, you came through a door.
I got a little lost. Can't we just get out the way you came in?
Not a good idea.
Well, I came this way. I think.
You always dress like prom night on the titanic?
What kind of business did you say your uncle was in?
I didn't.
Henchly, Trumble, and Collins.
That's my uncle. The last one, collins.
Come on.
Miranda, come on. No window shopping.
Don't try to understand, Miranda.
Not now.
Just know, you'll be safe.
That's what your parents wanted.
And, please, forgive me.
Are you okay?
Yeah,
I think so.
I told people I wasn't at my parents' funeral
because I didn't want to talk about it.
I guess I said it so often, I started believing it myself.
But...
I was there.
And I remember a man.
I think he was my uncle.
But if he was there, then why did he leave me?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what, when we get out of here, and we find him,
And I'll hold him down while you ask him. Deal?
Yeah.
Come on.
I told you I felt fresh air.
Do you remember climbing up any stairs?
I'm lucky I remember how to breathe.
We can climb down the trellis.
What, and just leave them here?
No, and get help. Lots of help.
What are you going to tell people?
That a maniac has our dead friend who's really alive,
or maybe we could come up
with something a little more believable,
like we're trapped in a haunted house?
Think of a really good lie on the way down.
Okay, I could almost jump from here.
Be careful.
You can't keep me here!
Hello?
Ali?
Miranda?
For a guy who's looking for somebody, you're not easy to find.
I didn't know I needed to be. You okay?
Um, we can talk about me after.
But right now I think your girl needs a hug.
I've been trying to call you.
Hanna, is everything okay?
What's going on? Where is everybody?
I lost them...
And I think A has Ali.
Oh, my God. Oh, my Ggod.
Spencer, wake up.
Spencer.
Oh, my God.
A's here!
It's okay, you're safe.
Are you okay?
Where is he?
Okay, I know it doesn't look like it, but this is a door.
Why am I doing this alone?
Are you sure we're in the right place?
Miranda? Are you okay?
That's me.
Help me!
Please. He's going to kill me!
Help me!
Please.
You shouldn't be in here.
You found the tunnel.
We followed Alison.
So, she was here.
Is this--
The house is my home, it will never belong to me.
I'm merely its caretaker.
And this room, it's your... office?
A space with no distractions opens the lines of communication.
So, that was one of your sessions.
Six months ago, this tape was stolen.
What is it?
What did you see?
It's not what I see...
It's what I feel.
One of you has been touched
by the one Alison fears the most.
I found it in my uncle's house.
There has to be some explanation.
Like a brother, or something.
It said I had no living relatives.
Yeah. Yeah, we'll meet you at the car.
Hanna? Are they okay?
Yeah, they're all okay, but we lost Ali. Again.
Could this night get any worse?
I'll get the spare.
One of us knows how to change a tire, right?
And you're looking at me 'cause I'm gay?
No. You just happen to be the sporty one.
So, guys, I think I'll peel off here.
No!
You don't have to stay here, you can come with us.
You're allowed to bring home strays?
I've done it before.
Thanks for the offer, but I can take care of myself.
Been doing it for a long time.
Caleb, help me out here.
You can't let her go back in that house.
Look, I know how it feels to want answers.
And I hope you find the ones you're looking for.
Come on, guys. Get outta here already.
It's an open invitation.
You can always come to Rosewood.
Thank you.
Bye.
God, I really don't think we should let her stay here.
You heard her. It's not about wanting answers,
it's about needing them.
Damn it.
What was that for?
For being the kind of guy I can ask to stay here
and take care of a girl that pretty.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Help her go find her uncle.
Then find me when you get home.
I love you, Hanna Marin.
You're not leaving, are you?
Not tonight.
I don't believe this.
They must have taken out the spare
when Melissia and I got into that accident.
Where's Caleb?
Uh, he's taking care of a friend.
All right, well let's just figure out
what we have to do to get out of here,
because I don't want to spend another minute in this town.
Who is that?
Ezra?
I've been calling, but you didn't answer.
I was getting worried.
Flat tire?
Yeah, and she doesn't have the spare.
Well, it's late. Why don't I give you guys a ride home?
Sold.
Well, come on, Spencer. We'll just send someone
for your car tomorrow, okay?
Alison?
Alison?
Did you miss me?
It was you, wasn't it? In Ravenswood.
Look, I don't have much time.
It's still not safe for me to be here.
Ali, don't leave again.
Look, I wanna come home, but you have to help me.
Why? Who are you afraid of?
Remember what I told you in the hospital, Hanna?
That was really you?
Aria?
You forgot your cell phone.
Have you noticed how many kids are buried in this cemetery?
Caleb? What's your last name?
Rivers. Why?
