beautiful morning , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s a shame you have to work , huh ? yeah .
anyway , i &apos;d like a large sausage and pepperoni-
it &apos;s my stuff , okay ?
just keep your hands off my stuff !
i didn &apos;t put my hands on your stuff .
hey ! just a second , derek .
what is the problem ?
alex read my journal .
i did not !
why would i even want to read your stupid journal ?
because it contains the details of a life ,
and you don &apos;t have one !
alex , don &apos;t read haley &apos;s journal .
sorry . my daughters .
you got kids ?
oh . what grade are you in ?
phil !
oh , that &apos;s my wife , claire .
luke was using my computer for this .
i &apos;m gonna have to , uh , call you back .
he told me he needed it to do homework ,
and then i find this , a @-@ a picture ...
of a topless woman ,
with the biggest boobs i have ever seen , driving a tractor .
okay . um- uh , first of all ,
that &apos;s a combine , not a tractor .
phil !
phil ! it is smut ,
and our 10 @-@ year @-@ old is looking at smut !
it &apos;s disgusting !
completely unacceptable .
here &apos;s the thing . that was my picture .
well , not really mine .
there &apos;s this guy at work who sends out these links .
doesn &apos;t matter who .
gil thorpe .
he sent out another one
of the same woman dressed as a battleship .
you know , the- you get- yeah .
and then one of the transformers- and then it-
anyway , i had every intention of telling claire .
i just wanted her to calm down first .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m going to pick up luke from his sleepover .
we need to talk to him about this now .
claire , this is a very delicate situation .
if we don &apos;t handle it right ,
luke might end up having an unhealthy attitude about sex ...
or agribusiness .
we &apos;ll talk about it when he gets home .
okay , fine .
but i am telling him
that every time he looks at porn , god kills a puppy .
maybe i should be the one to talk to him .
i am a very lucky woman .
i have a wonderful family ,
a beautiful home .
there &apos;s nothing that i would change .
i hate the dog butler .
i keep forgetting it &apos;s there . and every time it happens ,
it scares me all over again .
sometimes , at night ,
i think it &apos;s the devil .
el diablo .
barkley ? he &apos;s hilarious .
i was in vegas last month and i was winning .
and i thought , i could do the usual ,
be a chump , give the money back to the casino ,
or i could do something smart
and buy something for myself at the casino store .
he &apos;s already a family favorite .
rub his chin , a little under there . he likes that .
there you go . beautiful . there you go .
he &apos;s a dog and a butler . i mean , who couldn &apos;t love him ?
come .
dog .
第一季第十二集
okay , ready to go .
make sure you pee first .
what am i , seven years old ?
no . you do not want to go during the show .
the marionettes stop what they &apos;re doing ,
march to the edge of the stage and point at you .
okay , that sounds terrifying .
no , it &apos;s really funny .
oh , one of my favorite childhood memories
was attending the moscow marionette theater .
i grew up one mile away from missouri &apos;s largest waterslide .
and third largest in the country .
oh , really , cam . you never mentioned that before .
you feel like-
feel like a torpedo .
hey , cam , does the gardener usually work on saturdays ?
i don &apos;t know . he comes when we need him .
he &apos;s like batman but straight .
is he crying ?
oh , yeah . we should probably go out the back , huh ?
he &apos;s clearly in pain .
how can you just turn your back on a friend like that ?
a friend ? really ? what &apos;s his name ?
caesar salazar .
you made that up . you were gonna say &quot; caesar salad . &quot;
was not .
cam . come on . really ?
all right , don &apos;t worry , lily .
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll get to the show on time .
i &apos;m sure dad is just gonna go out
and give an encouraging word to the gardener ,
hopefully mention the snail problem ,
and then we are gonna be on- - no .
no , no . cam , no-
hello .
i don &apos;t think he speaks english .
okay , this might be a good time to mention to you ...
that the marionettes are not kind to latecomers .
they bend over and show their bloomers .
okay , i speak a little spanish . seor-
gracias .
what was that ?
i just asked him if he wanted to have a glass of water ...
and sit down for a minute ,
like any kind person would .
okay , i checked the rest of the computers in the house .
i didn &apos;t find any more porn .
that was hardly porn .
it was a topless woman on a tractor .
you know what they call that in europe ? a cereal commercial .
i should go talk to him .
honey ,
honey , honey . i got this . i got this .
no , no , no , no . i got this . i got this .
i was his age once .
breasts are like these scary , mystical things ...
that he &apos;s drawn to like frodo to mordor .
okay , i &apos;m definitely going-
no , no , no , no , no .
boys don &apos;t want their moms talking to &apos; em about sex ...
any more than girls want their dads talking to &apos; em about periods ,
bras and girdles and all that stuff .
you do know that women stopped wearing girdles , like , 30 years ago ?
honey , i know , i know .
that @-@ that @-@ that is exactly the kind of sexual revolution ...
that our son is going through right now .
so , just- let &apos;s just- just trust it .
fix that step . just know ,
i will handle this , okay ?
el diablo .
hey , gloria ,
do you have any idea why barkley was in the guest room ?
i was just doing a little redecorating .
sometimes it &apos;s good to move things around
just to see how they look .
yeah , but the guest room ? that &apos;s crazy .
he &apos;s not a guest . he works for us .
hey , give me a hand here , will you ?
i think his jacket shifted while i was moving him .
we can &apos;t have you untucked , our little butler .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense , does it , boy ?
what was that ? is he all right ?
ay , no . my bracelet got
caught a little bit here .
well , don &apos;t panic .
i &apos;m not panicking .
all right , try to relax .
we can fix him .
let me take a better look . come here , boy .
luke ?
hey , dad .
hey , buddy . um , look .
you and i need to have a little talk .
about what ?
well , it &apos;s about computer stuff .
how do you make sure you &apos;ve deleted something after you read it ?
sorry , jay . it was an accident .
you know , i &apos;m beginning to think you don &apos;t like barkley that much .
i mean , first you hide him in the guest room , and now this .
it &apos;s ridiculous . i didn &apos;t mean to hurt it .
first of all , let &apos;s cut the &quot; it &quot; s . he is a he .
and you can pretend to be innocent all you want ,
but action speaks louder than words .
yeah . they can be very revealing .
what are you trying to say ?
nothing . but you have to admit
that the dog butler is a little ridiculous .
you know what else i think is ridiculous ?
that mountain of pillows you have on our bed .
i feel like i &apos;m working on a loading dock
just trying to get under the covers .
they &apos;re pretty .
they &apos;re a damn nuisance .
okay , forgive me for trying to make our home beautiful .
you know , if i can put up with those ,
you can put up with a piece of art .
this is not art . this is an unholy mix between man and beast .
but , fine , if you love it so much , put it wherever you want .
thank you . where you going ? to get some more pillows ?
no , don &apos;t worry . it &apos;ll be a long
time before i bother you again with my pillows .
why is dad in luke &apos;s room with the door closed ?
they are having a little talk .
is luke being punished ?
is that just your favorite thing ,
when your brother or sister gets into trouble ?
my favorite is when they &apos;re both in trouble .
so , what &apos;d he do ?
did he cheat on a test ? he &apos;s a cheater .
he did not cheat on a test .
did he lie ? he lies all the time .
alex .
alex .
sorry . i &apos;m just worried about luke .
a lot of parents are hitting again .
i appreciate your concern ,
but your father has it under control .
twenty @-@ four .
twenty @-@ five .
flincher ! free slap . bring it up .
twenty @-@ nine .
can i be on the bottom now ?
yep .
how &apos;d it go ?
well , he was really embarrassed ,
but everything &apos;s- everything &apos;s fine now .
what &apos;d you say ?
well , you know ,
i kinda promised him we &apos;d keep everything between us .
matter of fact ,
he &apos;d be mortified if you brought it up with him ... ever .
oh , god , really ?
yeah .
that actually makes me feel kinda bad .
well , you &apos;re probably just feeling a little tense from all this .
i know i am .
you know what might help the situation ?
really ? right now ?
i meant going out for a few pizzas .
where &apos;s your mind ?
i guess i live in a house full of sex maniacs .
amigo ?
we can &apos;t help you if you won &apos;t come out .
what &apos;d he say ?
something &quot; house &quot; something .
come on . the show starts in a half hour ,
and we still have to pick up manny .
can we just- come on . move this thing along !
okay , this man is in crisis .
he could have a family health issue
or a personal health issue or a financial matter .
stop . you &apos;re getting all this from &quot; something house something &quot; ?
let &apos;s just call gloria and have her deal with it , okay ?
&quot; lt &quot; is a human being , mitchell .
named caesar salad .
okay .
what &apos;s going on with you ?
cam , you- you always do this .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re incapable of hearing anyone &apos;s sad story ...
without making it your job to fix it .
and then , my needs- my needs come second .
your needs right now ...
are a puppet show .
this man could have lost his brother in a cable car accident .
you understood &quot; casa . &quot;
okay , fine . if it &apos;ll prove to you ...
that i &apos;m not the obsessive helpaholic that you make me out to be ,
let &apos;s go to the puppet show .
cam .
let &apos;s go .
i think this has something to do with the gardener .
you think ?
just down the hall to the right .
ay . gracias , gracias .
perdn .
in there . okay .
okay , let &apos;s go .
no , please .
i know it &apos;s killing you
not to get back there in the middle of that .
oh , no , no , no , no . we are going .
these folks can find their own way out .
and now you &apos;ll know that i &apos;m not a
manic mother teresa out there collecting lost souls .
oh , come on .
dad ?
back here .
is manny ready ?
didn &apos;t you get the message ? he &apos;s not going .
what ?
ah , some mandatory cleanup at school .
what &apos;s the real reason ?
it &apos;s a puppet show , mitch .
perfect . all right , it &apos;s just you and me then , lily .
how &apos;s the little fortune cookie ?
ah , she @-@ she &apos;s good . she &apos;s good .
where &apos;s cam ?
we got into a fight .
because of him , i have a house full of latinos .
welcome to my world .
so , trouble in gay paradise , huh ?
he just can &apos;t say no to anybody who needs help .
and why do you have to always
add the word &quot; gay &quot; where it doesn &apos;t belong ?
hey , hey , you &apos;re not mad at me .
you &apos;re mad at the old balls and chain .
okay , dad , good talk . see you later .
come on , i didn &apos;t mean it .
hey , i didn &apos;t mean it . i &apos;m a little cranky .
i got into it with gloria a little bit .
oh , no . what happened ?
ah , she hates barkley .
it &apos;s the same stuff i went over with your mom all the time .
&quot; get rid of the boat . &quot; &quot; get rid of the motorcycle . &quot;
you know , i liked those things .
why do you have to get rid of it then ?
you know , actually , i don &apos;t .
anyway , i &apos;m gluing his hand on over here . his hand came off .
rough day , dad .
your hot , young wife doesn &apos;t like your doll .
yeah , unlike your big problem ,
&quot; my boyfriend &apos;s too nice to people . &quot;
no , see- mmm- that &apos;s not all it is .
he helps animals .
he &apos;s always volunteering for things .
trust me . it @-@ lt &apos;s worse than it sounds .
who are we kidding ? we both got it pretty good .
hell , i &apos;m probably fighting with your mom
more than i &apos;m fighting with gloria on this thing .
a bird fell out of a tree
and he fed it with an eyedropper .
just drop it , kid .
we &apos;re both with people different from us ,
and that &apos;s gonna create stuff , but you want different .
your mom and i were perfect on paper
and you know how that ended .
what i got now is a lot better .
sure , people look at us sometimes .
and sometimes even i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re together .
but we &apos;re happy . at the end of the day
there &apos;s no one i &apos;d rather come home to .
you mean gloria .
who else ?
no one .
i &apos;ll see you later .
see you , kid .
did you draw on my poster ?
yeah , i did . maybe you &apos;ll think
about that the next time you read my journal .
i didn &apos;t read your stupid journal ,
and i waited in line to get this signed , haley .
oh , don &apos;t be such a baby . it &apos;s just some dude with weird hair .
that &apos;s maya angelou , you idiot .
oh , sorry . i don &apos;t follow the wnba .
you know what ? this is the worst thing you &apos;ve ever done ,
and i &apos;ll never forgive you !
you started it !
what are you looking at ?
well , i just heard-
i was the one who read haley &apos;s diary .
i was playing on her computer and it just opened .
okay , i opened it .
but i didn &apos;t mean for anyone to fight .
oh , ome already . mitchell , hi ..
hi , cam . hi .
did you forget the tickets ?
no . you know , i was never gonna enjoy the show without you , so-
oh . but you were so excited
to take lily to see the russian marionettes .
oh , she &apos;s probably a little young anyway .
we can just prop her in front of the dryer for a half hour .
listen , cam ,
i @-@ i love that you try and help the world ,
and i &apos;m very lucky to have you in my life .
oh , mitchell .
how &apos;d everything work out with the gardener ?
uh , great . great .
turned out it was his wedding day , and he was a little nervous .
but you know what ? there &apos;s no need to apologize .
no , i need to . i &apos;ve been very selfish .
no , no . sometimes i take things too far .
okay . if that ever happens , i will let you know .
okay .
is there a reason i can &apos;t go inside ?
no . no , no . no .
y ahora te pronuncio hombre y esposa .
la puedes besar .
mom , can i talk to you ?
sure , honey . what &apos;s going on ?
i feel bad about something i did .
oh , sweetie . is this about the computer ?
yeah .
something you shouldn &apos;t have been looking at ?
yeah . it was just so freaky .
i couldn &apos;t stop looking .
i know , sweet pea .
but the important thing is you did stop looking .
yeah .
after about an hour .
okay . well , it &apos;s perfectly normal to be curious about these things .
some parts were funny .
and some parts just seemed crazy .
well , i hope you realize that some of those parts weren &apos;t real .
obviously .
but they can be totally real , right ?
like anne frank &apos;s ?
what ?
all i know is it really made me wonder about haley .
that &apos;s disturbing , sweetie . why haley ?
it was her journal .
you read my journal ? you little creep !
i &apos;m sorry ! i couldn &apos;t help it .
wait . haley &apos;s journal too ?
luke , you are now banned from the computer .
what ?
what happened ? who &apos;s in trouble ?
luke read my journal !
i told you it wasn &apos;t me !
you know , i &apos;m gonna kill you .
haley , calm down .
wait , you &apos;re not even gonna yell at him ? that was private .
oh , please . the most shocking thing in there was your spelling .
you read it too ?
am i the only one who hasn &apos;t read it ?
i was looking through the computers in the house for pornography .
sick .
not for me .
i wanted to see what you guys are looking at .
so you &apos;re violating our privacy .
when i find out that my children ...
are looking at a naked picture online ,
they don &apos;t have any privacy .
who was looking at naked pictures ?
that doesn &apos;t matter .
i wasn &apos;t .
wasn &apos;t me . that &apos;s gross . i &apos;m 10 !
wait a minute .
what &apos;s wrong with you people ?
if it wasn &apos;t you , who was it ?
mangia !
rosa , thank you for coming .
gracias .
carlos , let me know how it works out with that dentist .
victor , you owe me a dance .
yes , i &apos;m a caring person .
and without mitchell ,
i would just keep giving and giving and giving .
i &apos;m like a big runaway charity truck
and mitchell is my off @-@ ramp full of safety gravel .
he knows how to say no .
he always can put himself first .
he certainly can turn his back on someone suffering .
no , really . keep going .
he-
don &apos;t keep going !
muchas gracias .
hey , good @-@ bye .
that was nice .
oh , god . dad .
looks like i missed the party , huh ?
what is- what is that doing here ?
he is a gift for you and cam .
thank you .
he lost his monocle on the drive . head was out the window .
well , they love that .
let &apos;s put him here for now .
i don &apos;t want that .
i think he &apos;s cute .
let &apos;s give him a chance .
i came as soon as i heard your message .
you said that somebody was getting married ?
gloria , there you are . i &apos;ve got good news .
what &apos;s the matter ?
honey ? hey .
i &apos;m really sorry .
that picture was just something that someone sent me .
doesn &apos;t matter who .
gil thorpe .
anyway , i don &apos;t do that stuff .
you &apos;re all the porn i need . that &apos;s- uh-
honey , it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s fine .
now , it &apos;s fine .
i couldn &apos;t care less about the picture .
i was just upset when i thought it was luke .
haley , honey , i really wish
you would give me a hand with all this laundry .
you never , ever-
haley &apos;s off in her own world .
alex has never really been a kid .
but luke is my baby .
is it really too much to ask
that he stay a sweet , innocent kid ...
forever ?
hey , buddy . um- here . sorry .
we &apos;ll dribble later .
um , i just , uh- i just want to say i &apos;m sorry .
i never meant to blame you for that whole picture thing .
your mom sort of thought it was yours
and i should have stopped it , but i didn &apos;t .
so what was the picture of ?
well , it was a woman on a tractor and she had her shirt off .
was it hot ?
okay , we &apos;re being honest here .
um , this particular woman-
well , my tastes do run to the curvy ,
and the cowboy hat did not hurt one bit .
couple that with the cutoff jeans-
and you were asking about the weather , weren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
well , this is good . this is good .
you &apos;re gonna be going through some changes soon .
and i think now you can feel safe talking to me about whatever .
and so it ends .
sadly , i &apos;ve been summarily dismissed
from the employ of masters cameron and mitchell .
the former being an utter delight ,
and the latter being a humorless snoot .
just come on . get him in the car . the thrift shop &apos;s closing .
what is this exciting thrift shop you speak of ?
many of my relatives were taken out of their homes ...
to be released into the green pastures in their maturity-
did you just say &quot; matoority ? &quot;
unhand me , you brute !
i regret nothing !
i &apos;ll pay you . i &apos;m a comfortable man .
i &apos;ve been stealing from your father for days .
oh , is there any better feeling in the world
than having your ears flap in the wind ?
you know what ? get out .
you mean it ? sweet freedom ?
no , not you , barkley . cameron , out .
