i mean , you stole my best friend , and it &apos;s not okay .
it &apos;s not okay for the two of you to hang out like i don &apos;t exist .
i am not hanging out .
i am trying to help her .
by hanging out with her .
we gonna do this or not ?
i &apos;m too mad to even look at you .
well , then roll over .

the doctors who see medicine as science only
you don &apos;t want them by your side when your bleeding won &apos;t stop
or when your child is screaming in pain .

the clinicians go by the book .
the artists follow their guts .
nope .

the artists feel your pain ,
and they go to extremes to make it stop .

i just flew in from africa , so i went to a hotel
and took a shower , got some sleep ,
and came back really early .

i &apos;ll travel to malawi every two months
for the next three years to oversee everything ,
and i got a leading pediatric surgeon
to oversee the day @-@ to @-@ day operations .

well , i don &apos;t understand .
so you &apos;re saying i can &apos;t , what ,
i can &apos;t have a job here ?

to the woman i love . you don &apos;t even know this guy .

bailey ?
bailey , fill us in .
again , that &apos;s at pacific college .
we now take you live to our on @-@ scene reporter .
students and faculty are still in the building .
i &apos;m trying to get some answers , but what we know so far

okay . okay . there are at least 20 victims .
i &apos;m sorry . you can &apos;t be here . clear the area , please .

we &apos;re going priority one .
v @-@ tach on the monitor . any pulse with that ?
no pulse . starting c.p.r.
let &apos;s get him to the hospital .
you need to crack his chest . you need to ...
someone crack his chest .
there are 15 ambulances on the way .
maybe more to come .
first one is three minutes out .
people ...
people ... our own trauma is fresh ,
and we are going to have feelings today ,
and there is no shame in that .
what i want to say is ,
what we went through six months ago ,
they are going through right now ,
which makes them our brothers and sisters ...
which makes them fellow travelers ,
which makes them our own .
so to the very best of our ability ,
we are gonna do our work first .
and you &apos;re gonna have your feelings later .
grey .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
go to the pit , make sure we &apos;re stocked .
call the blood bank -- - i &apos;m fine .
call the blood bank .
tell them to give us all the o neg they have .
i got a cop . michael fazioli .
28 . g.s.w to the right upper arm and left leg .
okay , this one &apos;s mine .
all right , i &apos;m on that one .
chief webber .
sarge ?
all right , kepner , get him to trauma one .
do labs , trauma series ,
and x @-@ ray this leg and arm .
okay .
this is the cop that took down the shooter .
you &apos;re kidding .
yeah , he was on the radio .
he told me he landed a shot ,
and then he went down .
i have conflicting reports
about what the shooter looked like ,
so if you could wake faz up , get him talking ?
faz ?
mike fazioli . he &apos;s a good kid , great cop .
one of ours .
what do you have ?
professor john sturgeon , 48,
fell out a fourth @-@ story window ,
has an open skull fracture and a blown pupil .
he fell ?
he helped a dozen kids out the window and up on to the roof ,
then he tried to go himself and slipped .
he &apos;s herniating . get him to the front of the line .
get him to the o.r.
you okay ?
nothing about this is okay .
two and three are open !
15 year old , kelly keck , g.s.ws to the leg and abdomen .
abdomen rigid , systolic 75 , last pulse 147 .
she &apos;s 15 ?
yeah . look what being a genius gets you .
clear trauma three and page stark .
right away , doctor .
jared swork , 20 years old , single entrance wound
to the left fifth intercostal space .
no exit wound . lost vitals in front of us .
this is the emergency thoracotomy we called in about .
you did a thoracotomy in the field ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
i had to crack his chest .
cristina -- - can you feel the lesion ?
yes , he &apos;s got a big hole in his right ventricle ,
but as long as i keep my hand here ,
i can feel a good heartbeat .
cristina .
what ? what ?
you &apos;re going to the o.r. ?
she &apos;s got her hand on the hole , owen .
i &apos;ll be fine . i &apos;ll be okay .
bring him to two .
this artery is in pieces . vascular clamp .
here you go .
your best move is to amputate that leg .
you &apos;ve got no more time to waste down there .
what ? what ?
the artery &apos;s blown . the femur is shattered .
torres can fix that .
i &apos;m more concerned about her life than her leg .
and i &apos;m sure her parents will be , too .
look , this kid is 15 . you can save this leg .
you can &apos;t just cut it off .
what i can &apos;t do is
to spend any more time arguing with you .
would you maintain pressure there ?
prep the damn leg , karev .
freakin &apos; do something !
intracranial pressure &apos;s getting higher .
are we doing a craniectomy or a craniotomy ?
craniectomy is our best bet .
dr. shepherd .
yes .
the professor &apos;s wife just arrived .
can someone speak to her ?
i &apos;ll go . i &apos;ll be quick .
yeah .
you paged me ?
yang ?
she was at the scene .
oh , i was at the scene .
he &apos;s got a tear on the right ventricle .
and there could be torrential bleeding once we get in ,
so i just , uh , just wanted a little backup ,
just a little extra backup .
she &apos;s not sure if i can handle it .
i &apos;m ready . i &apos;m in . i &apos;ll go-- i &apos;ll go scrub .
all right . let &apos;s get this boy on bypass .
mrs. sturgeon .
yes , hi .
hi .
are you john &apos;s doctor ? is he okay ?
he fell from a fourth @-@ story window and landed on his head ,
so we &apos;re taking him to surgery right now .
wait , wait . surgery ?
we will be removing the left side of his skull
to give his brain room to swell .
okay , i @-@ i want to come with you .
i @-@ i w--i w--i need to come with you ...
because john doesn &apos;t like hospitals .
you can &apos;t come into the o.r.
no , no , no .
see , john is afraid of doctors , okay ?
so i have to be with him . please let me be with him .
mrs. sturgeon , i &apos;m so sorry ,
but you can &apos;t come in to the o.r.
i will come out and update you every chance i get , though . okay ?
just , uh , excuse me .
yes .
hi . would you sit with mrs. sturgeon ?
this is gonna be a long day ,
and you all need to take care of each other . okay ?
okay .
you can put in a shunt and then do a graft .
do you even have privileges here anymore ?
whether i have privileges or not isn &apos;t the point .
karev &apos;s right .
karev is not on this case anymore .
dr. stark , please , just take the time to do the graft ,
and you can save her leg .
i know very well what can and can &apos;t be done ,
dr. robbins . i have bigger fish to fry ,
and this was very unprofessional of you .
i am all done engaging with it .
all right . get the hell out of my o.r. , karev .
i &apos;m sorry . i am unprofessional ? i &apos;m unprofess--i--
body block him , karev .
don &apos;t let him near that leg .
ah , he &apos;s got some blood in his chest , but the bullet &apos;s not there .
it &apos;s not in his leg or in his arm . kepner .
um ... uh , we should put in a chest tube
and get more studies to see what kind of damage we &apos;re dealing with .
is there any chance we can wake him up
while we &apos;re waiting for the studies ?
we could reverse his pain meds ,
but it would be a pretty traumatic awakening .
he &apos;d be in a lot of pain .
chief , i &apos;m getting all sorts of conflicting reports
as to what the shooter looks like .
you know , kids , uh , in shock , they don &apos;t remember ,
but cops are trained to remember .
i don &apos;t know if there &apos;s a second shooter ,
if this is some kind of plot ,
but until i have a positive i.d. , i &apos;ve got nothing .
believe me , faz would rather feel some pain
if he can i.d. the shooter for me .
okay , i &apos;ll reverse the meds .
okay .
kepner . let &apos;s set up the chest tube .
chief webber , this guy you replaced me with
is a study in incompetence .
not now , robbins .
no , no , yes , now , because dr. incompetence is about to
hack off a perfectly good leg .
robbins , i &apos;m pretty busy here . what do you want me to do ?
give me privileges .
it &apos;s all hands on deck .
of course you have privileges .
okay . thank you .
it &apos;s not an easy day to be the man in charge .
torres ! o.r. 2 right now . 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 !
what ? where are you going ?
i need scrubs .
uh ...
okay , bailey , can you take over for me here ?
oh . okay , excuse me .
this is , uh , chuck fowler . he &apos;s 21 years old .
zone two injury of the neck , secondary to graze g.s.w.
he has a hematoma and a c.t. angio &apos;s been ordered .
thank you .
okay .
how you doing , chuck ?
who walks into a classroom with an automatic weapon ?
who does that ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know .
okay , here i go .
i &apos;m a wrestler , man . i &apos;m all @-@ state .
saw or no saw , you &apos;re not getting past me .
karev , you want to tell me what &apos;s going on here ?
he &apos;s lost his mind . that &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
he &apos;s lost his mind , and he is destroying his career .
that is what is going on here !
check it out , torres .
15 year old , g.s.w. to the thigh with comminuted femur fracture .
laceration to the superficial femoral artery . ha !
all right . what about her nerves ? are her nerves salvageable ?
kid was moving her leg before we put her under .
they &apos;re intact .
she has a life @-@ threatening hemorrhage in her leg
and multi @-@ organ injuries in her abdomen .
abdominal bleeding is under control for now .
thanks so much , dave . i appreciate the support there .
well , i can put in a traction pin to stabilize the femur .
right ?
and then we can use a graft to restore blood flow .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
i have never experienced anything like this before in my life !
dr. stark , you &apos;re new here , but in this hospital ,
we take shootings personally ,
and i can save this leg .
so are you gonna work with me or not ?
no , no , i am . dr. stark ,
i &apos;ve just spoken with chief webber .
this is my patient now .
what ? !
this is ... th @-@ th @-@ th-- this ...
yes !
karev , you gotta go , too .
the pit &apos;s full of kids that need doctors ,
and we can handle this one without you , okay ?
that &apos;s cool . my work is done .
ha ! all @-@ state , baby !
you see that bridging vein ?
you &apos;ll have to compromise it
if you &apos;re gonna pull the skull flap back .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i &apos;m gonna go update the wife again .
dr. grey , you &apos;re a surgeon , not a social worker .
you can &apos;t spare me for five minutes ?
and you have a patient open on the table .
well , that &apos;s not the whole story .
don &apos;t start this again .
well , the other part of the story
is that he &apos;s got a wife who &apos;s panicking in the waiting room-- -
all right , fine . go .
just let me concentrate .
i &apos;ll be quick .
all right . he &apos;s ready .
look , i &apos;m gonna push the naloxone .
he &apos;s gonna wake up and he &apos;s gonna hurt .
so talk quick , okay ?
ready .
faz , it &apos;s marty .
can you hear me ?
oh , god . it hurts .
aah ! oh , god !
faz , i need you to describe the shooter .
can you do that for me , bud ?
chief webber .
did you really approve of robbins storming my o.r. ,
stealing my patient , humiliating me publicly ?
there are plenty of patients to go around , dr. stark .
jump in and find one .
i will not .
what i will do is to go back to my patient in my o.r.--
go be a damn doctor !
people are dying . now go save a life , right now !
just hang on .
i need the info .
okay , i understand .
excuse me ...
dr. hunt . i &apos;m free . do you need me ?
i &apos;m free . dr. hunt .
they just found another classroom full of victims .
we &apos;re getting at least a dozen more .
crap .
and we &apos;re out of o.r.s.
what ?
we &apos;re out of o.r.s , we &apos;re out of space ,
and all the other hospitals are at capacity .
if any--any of them need surgery , we &apos;re ...
we &apos;re screwed .
dr. altman ,
you have a g.s.w. to the chest ?
dr. yang .
dr. yang was on the scene .
she performed an emergency thoracotomy in the field .
you all right , dr. yang ?
yes , sir . i &apos;m staying , if that &apos;s okay .
uh , dr. yang , can you tell me what your patient was wearing ,
and where his clothes are ?
uh , they were cut off at the scene .
it was , um , a green hoodie , jeans .
is he a redhead , about 20 ?
yes .
uh , why , sir ?
send me down any bullet fragments you pull out of his body .
chief , what &apos;s going on ?
your patient &apos;s the shooter .
send down any bullets immediately .
they &apos;re evidence .
okay , um ...
okay . where were we ?
you were about to reconstruct the ventricle .
right . right . thank you . okay .
hand me 3 @-@ 0 ethibond , please .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t , dr. altman .
you can &apos;t hand me the ethibond ?
i can &apos;t .
she can &apos;t save this guy ...
is what she &apos;s saying .
he just shot up dozens of people ,
and this surgery is gonna take all day .
dr. avery .
that &apos;s taking three doctors and four nurses away
from helping other people ,
people who didn &apos;t shoot up
a campus full of innocent kids--
dr. avery .
i operated on iraqi soldiers
who blew up dozens of our guys .
i didn &apos;t like it , but i did it ,
because i &apos;m a doctor , and i took an oath .
you &apos;re not a jury or a judge .
if there &apos;s a life to be saved ,
we save that life , regardless--
i &apos;m not doing this .
no .
anyone else ?
i &apos;m sorry .
dr. yang ...
are you staying ?
yes .
all right .
okay , great .
uh , 3 @-@ 0 ethibond , please .
oh , come on , come on . press on the cricoid more .
i can &apos;t see the cords . come on , faz . stay with me .
kepner .

x @-@ rays were clear , no bullet , so i did an ultrasound .
found blood in the belly .
okay , we need all available surgical equipment .
okay .

ready for transport .
uh , chief . you should stay in that trauma room .
there are no o.r.s. get the chief an anesthesiologist .
right away , doctor .
what ? i @-@ i got a cop with blood in his belly ,
the same cop that took down the shooter .
you &apos;re saying i have to operate on him in a trauma room ?
i &apos;m saying , it &apos;s your best option right now .
sir , his pressure &apos;s dropping .
hunt . i hope you know what you &apos;re doing , hunt .
yes , sir . so do i.
kepner , lock him down in there
and get me a major procedures tray now .
okay .
avery , is altman done yet ?
hurry , hurry .
no , and while we &apos;ve got a cop bleeding out down here .
she &apos;s occupying a perfectly good o.r.
going to extreme measures to save the damn shooter .
i tried talking to her .
wait . altman &apos;s guy is the shooter ?
d @-@ does cristina know that ?
yeah . so does altman . i walked out .
all right . go to the emergency room . there is incoming .
kepner , i need you to go to outpatient recovery .
i need to get these supplies to the chief .
no , no , no , no , no . hey , you . take this to the chief
in trauma one .
okay , doctor .
go to outpatient recovery
right now and oversee it .
what--what am i doing ?
it &apos;s like a mobile trauma unit . it &apos;s like a mash unit .
i &apos;ll be there in a moment .
wait , wait . where are you going ?
you were trained for this , kepner . oversee it .
okay , coming through .
i understand why you &apos;re mad at me . i do .
no .
i even understand you slamming the door in my face , but--
no . no , you will not hold me hostage
and make me listen to you .
i am rebuilding the leg of a kid who &apos;s been shot .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s why i &apos;m here . that is the only reason .
no talking .
none .
okay , if anyone &apos;s free , we have an incoming patient .
g.s.w. to the flank with active hemorrhage .
why are we still accepting critical cases ?
i &apos;m coming , kepner .
thank you .
uh , look , continue to debride out
the devitalized tissue and repair the injured vessel .
you &apos;re serious ?
what , you want to take
the incoming g.s.w.to the flank ?
all right , then . just , uh , there &apos;s enough surgeons around
if you have questions . just take care of chuck .
okay , chuck .
i &apos;m gonna be doing a vascular repair on you
in a freakin &apos; mosh pit .
oh , son of a bitch .
i.c.p. &apos; s still 45 .
his brain is still swelling .
we &apos;re gonna have to remove the other side .
you &apos;re gonna take off both sides of his skull ?
we &apos;re gonna leave this strip here
that covers the upper superior sagittal sinus .
let &apos;s get the other side prepped .
well , i &apos;m gonna go update the wife .
since when are you so interested in updating the wife
in the waiting room than doing this ?
since i was the wife in the waiting room , derek .
i mean , honestly , do you think you and cristina
are the only two who have ever been through a trauma ?
stop . don &apos;t do that . do not bring cristina back into this .
you don &apos;t get to act like a spoiled little brat in my o.r.
why is it okay for cristina to do whatever she wants ,
but it &apos;s not okay for me .
because i &apos;m not hiding under o.r. tables
or bartending ?
meredith .
i mean , honestly ,
you and cristina are so busy supporting each other ,
have you even noticed that i went through a trauma , too ?
i was the wife in the waiting room , derek .
and it &apos;s so hard to be the wife in the waiting room .
so hard that i walked into the o.r.
while the shooter had a gun to you
and told him to shoot me instead .
that &apos;s how hard it is to be the wife in the waiting room .
excuse me . i &apos;m gonna go update my patient .
okay .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry .
okay , let &apos;s continue on .
dr. shepherd is going to remove
the other half of your husband &apos;s skull .
if all goes well in the o.r. ,
he &apos;ll then freeze the skull to keep the bones from dying ,
and then he &apos;ll sew the scalp and the muscle back
over the exposed brain .
look , i don &apos;t understand . i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t understand .
i know it sounds frightening and extreme .
and it is .
but dr. shepherd is very good .
and i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll come out and keep you posted , okay ?
okay . okay .
i &apos;m looking for the sackett family .
anybody here for a john sackett ?
excuse me . is anyone here related to jared swork ?
yes . that &apos;s my son .
how is he ? is he okay ?
ma &apos;am , would you mind coming with me ?
my son was shot . he wasn &apos;t the shooter .
no . no !
my son didn &apos;t do this !
no , no , no .
what the hell ?
sloan , move on .
i &apos;m gonna kick your ass .
kick it later .
we &apos;ve got a kid in three with a g.s.w. to the shoulder ,
and we need this space for incoming .

that &apos;s a hack job you did .
somebody get dr. nelson here . now .
i &apos;ll get grey . you get bed three .

we gotta evacuate that clot .
okay , we can do that . we can do that .
i need some hands over here , avery .
yep .
arterial repair . can you hold that ?
got it .
you know , altman &apos;s still in o.r. 1 ?
so you can &apos;t choose who you save .
yeah , that &apos;s apparently the party line .
the shooter &apos;s sick .
nobody does this in their right mind .
what &apos;s your point ?
my brother just had a psychotic break
and tried to kill my sister . and if he got hurt ,
even if he got hurt hurting people ,
i would want his doctors
to do everything they could to save him .
no matter what he did , he &apos;s still my little brother .
making the incision .
ready with the drill ?
yeah .
no . you &apos;re gonna do it .
mark .
she &apos;s your patient , dr. grey .
you &apos;re gonna save her life .
ready ?
gently .
right there .
perfect .
perfect .
damn it . he &apos;s crashing .
i need a crash cart in here now .
hey , do not die , chuck .

she &apos;s ... right there .
mrs. sturgeon .
yeah . i &apos;m dr. shepherd .
uh , your husband is in a medically induced coma .
he &apos;ll have to stay that way until his brain heals .
and hopefully , in a couple of weeks ,
we &apos;ll be able to replace the skull and wake him up .
wait . you &apos;re saying that he lived ?
that he &apos;s alive ?
uh , we have a l--
long road ahead of us ,
but , yes , he is alive ,
and i can take you to him if you &apos;d like .
oh , thank you . oh , my god .
it &apos;s okay . you can see him in a few minutes , all right ?
he made it ? i told you . i knew it .
excuse me , ma &apos;am .
uh , has anyone talked to you about your son ?
the police questioned me for hours ,
as if i should &apos;ve known something .
they found a ...
suicide note in his jeans .
and i @-@ i didn &apos;t know anything .
my whole life ...
everything ... i ever knew is a lie .
he &apos;s my baby .
all i want to know is if he &apos;s alive .
is that terrible ?
all these people he hurt ...
does that make me a terrible person ?
your son ...
was shot in the chest .
dr. altman , who &apos;s a very good heart surgeon ,
is doing everything that she can .
she &apos;s still in surgery , which means he &apos;s still alive .
and she &apos;ll come find you as soon as she &apos;s out .
thank you .
he &apos;s fine .
oh , god . oh , my god . you &apos;re kidding me .
no . it was touch and go for a while ,
but he &apos;s gonna be fine .
and , um ...
let &apos;s stop meeting like this , marty .
oh , please , god .
please , god .
this is-- this is a huge victory .
you know , whatever else happened today ,
we worked together well , so ... thank you .
thank you for coming when i asked you to come
and for fighting stark with me .
calliope .
i am ...
so deeply , deeply ,
deeply sorry
for hurting you so much .
i am so sorry ,
because i am so in love with you ,
and i will spend the rest of my life telling you that .
i &apos;ll apologize to you every day if that &apos;s what you need .
but please ...
please don &apos;t walk away again .
i came across the world to be with you .
i love you .
please .
you had to fly across the world to get to me , arizona ,
because you flew a whole world away
without ever looking back . you just left .
and this might be news to you--
you know , i @-@ i think it kind of is--
but you &apos;re not the only one in this relationship .
there are two of us .
and you came back today , but i didn &apos;t .
whatever else happened , that--that ...
that hasn &apos;t changed .
oh , you ...
you &apos;ve been holding everybody up
even though ...
you amaze me .
i know you &apos;re mad at me for taking cristina fishing .
and i know you think it didn &apos;t work .
i just heard she &apos;s o.r. 1 .
what ?
she &apos;s here .
i just took my kid to a room .
he was the last one .
besides this one .
mm @-@ hmm . yeah . besides this one .
37 degrees .
should be any minute now .
we saw 26 patients .
26 victims ...
and we had no casualties .
no one died .
i hate this place .
surgery is extreme .
we cut into your body , take out pieces ,
and put what &apos;s left back together .
i was holding a grudge .
i can hire you back .
but you &apos;re gonna have to work under stark .
she &apos;s , uh , still sedated .
and she &apos;s just a kid .
she shouldn &apos;t have a big ugly scar .
uh , do you mind waiting ?
i &apos;ll be about another hour .
i love you .
so ...
yeah , just , uh ...
take your time .
i , um ... i &apos;ll wait .
good thing life doesn &apos;t come with a scalpel ,
because if it did ...
when things started to hurt ,
we would just cut and cut and cut .
hey . i &apos;m-- i &apos;m really sorry i &apos;m late .
you look exhausted .
you look exhausted .
i look handsome .
how about we get you some insurance ?
let &apos;s have a drink first to toast the day .
henry--
because i &apos;ve never been married . have you ?
no .
um ... bt i wouldn &apos;t say that this is exactly a--
i know what this is . but i say we raise a glass anyway .
look , there was no ring , right ,
no vows , no photographer ,
no wedding cake , which i was most disappointed by ,
because i love wedding cake .
i think we can at least have a toast , right ?
i spent the day in the o.r. saving someone
who really , really is , um ...
not a very good person .
well , you saved me , too .
you saved my life this morning ,
and that deserves a toast ,
even if it wasn &apos;t a real wedding .
okay .
okay .
the thing is ,
what we take away with a scalpel ...
we can &apos;t ever get back .
you want to get a drink ?
yeah , i do .
maybe not a real drink , actually ,
because i &apos;m trying to get pregnant ,
and supposedly , alcohol will make my baby have three heads
and 16 toes .
want to get some crack cocaine ?
so like i said ...
