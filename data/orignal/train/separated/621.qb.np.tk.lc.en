第一季 第一集
when i was a little girl ,
my understanding of revenge was
as simple as the sunday school proverb that hid behind .
neat little morality slogans ,
like &quot; do unto others &quot;
and &quot; two wrongs don &apos;t make a right . &quot;
but two wrongs can never make a right
because two wrongs can never equal each other .
纽约州 南汉普顿
for the truly wronged ...
real satisfaction can only be found
in one of two places ...
absolute forgiveness ...
or mortal vindication .
this is not a story about forgiveness .
emily .
i &apos;ve been looking for you . where &apos;s daniel ?
uh , he &apos;s walking the beach . we &apos;re having a thing .
same thing or different thing ?
same thing . but don &apos;t worry . he &apos;s right behind me .
it &apos;s my job to worry .
your job is to enjoy yourself .
it &apos;s your engagement party .
can someone get me a 20 on daniel grayson ?
hey , congrats , emily .
thank you .
nice night for it .
nice night for what , nolan ?
celebrating .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
that makes two of us .
emily , where have you been hiding ?
come on . let &apos;s see that ring , girl .
i feel like a jackass in this tux .
well , stop acting like one ,
and you &apos;ll stop feeling like one .
trust me . if your friends could see you now--
i &apos;d probably get jumped .
hey , you really want outta that tux ?
come on . we &apos;ll run away together .
you &apos;re slow .
i &apos;m going . i &apos;m going .
little too much food lately .
come on .
maybe not .
where are we going ?
you ask too many questions .
show me what you got , bad boy .
here . let me help you .
i got it . i got it .
fire and ice ...
when we first sat down to discuss tonight &apos;s occasion ,
i was immediately taken with the idea
of an evening inspired by primal bookends--
fire and ice ...
beginnings and endings ...
and the love between a man and a woman .
yo . yo , 8 mile ,
private party here !
... a starry evening .
that creep better not be taking pictures .
you got a problem ? !
tonight not only marks the final weekend
of a remarkable summer in the hamptons ,
it is also the celebration of my son daniel &apos;s engagement ...
to the lovely and beguiling ms. emily thorne .
and though we &apos;ve only known her for a few short months ,
emily already feels like the piece of the family puzzle
we never even knew was missing .
in a word ,
i approve .
and as anyone can tell you ,
approval is not something i give away freely .
where the hell is my son ?
charlotte .
oh , my god .
mom !
mom !
my brother ... somebody come here !
come here !
mom !
daniel !
daniel !
daniel !
get away from my son !
daniel !
daniel , please ! no !
daniel !
i can &apos;t tell you what a rare opportunity you have here , ms. thorne .
the current owners live in the city , of course ,
but they &apos;ve been loyal hamptonites for years .
perhaps if mr. davis had been a bit more loyal to his wife ,
they wouldn &apos;t be renting out this season .
word has it , he dumped her for a girl half his age .
men .
you mind if i look around a bit ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re here for .
dad ?
hey , kiddo . you having fun exploring ?
we really get to spend the whole summer here ?
and every summer after that .
what do you think ?
i think mom would &apos;ve loved it .
hey , you know how much i love you , amanda ?
infinity ?
well , infinity ...
times infinity .
ms. thorne ?
now you have to imagine ,
it &apos;s memorial day weekend ,
75 and sunny ,
all those boys of summer wondering who the new girl is .
and that &apos;s grayson manor .
you won &apos;t find a better address than this .
i &apos;ll take it .
oh . wonderful .
i &apos;ll get the contract .
hello , hello .
ashley , hey .
what do you think ?
are you kidding ? look at this place .
i want your life .
you love your life .
yeah , you &apos;re right . i just want your money .
what &apos;s mine is yours . should i get us some glasses ?
i wish . it &apos;s for victoria grayson .
who ... ?
you &apos;re hopeless .
victoria grayson--
reigning queen of the hamptons .
not to mention , your new next door neighbor .
queen victoria ?
mm . believe me , she &apos;s earned the title .
my boss has me handling the guest list
for her memorial day party .
if i screw this up , i might as well move back to croydon .
well , how much are the tickets ?
10,000 a pop .
count me in for one .
are you sure ?
it &apos;s for a good cause , right ?
yeah , my career . thank you .
you want to get drunk on cheap margaritas later ?
with or without you .
good luck with her highness .
bye .
let &apos;s dump our long position on 5- and 10 @-@ year treasuries
before the fed stops buying them up .
and , uh , get us into some of those low @-@ rated tech bonds . thanks
looks like lydia and michael &apos;s new renter is settling in .
lucky girl , scoring that property .
pretty one , too ,
even from up here .
i guess that makes her doubly lucky .
i don &apos;t believe in luck .
i thought you were taking the weekend off .
there . i &apos;m off .
ew . get a room , you guys .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , charlie . i didn &apos;t see you sneaking in .
didn &apos;t see you sneaking out last night , either , charlotte .
i went over to tracey &apos;s .
told you i was going before you went to bed .
no , you didn &apos;t .
mom , you &apos;re too young and too pretty to be this senile .
remind me to buy her a cat bell .
aw , let her have a little fun .
she got straight a &apos;s this year .
no one &apos;s accusing her of being stupid .
don &apos;t think i didn &apos;t see you eyeballing that case of beer , dec.
our dad owns a bar , dumbass .
i can get as much beer as i want .
all right . well , in that case ,
i &apos;ll just have to make sure
dad double @-@ checks the inventory while i &apos;m gone .
why don &apos;t you tell me another hundred times , huh ?
did you already wash those garbage bins out back ?
beats uploading this future shipwreck .
ahoy ! captain porter .
welcome back , nolan . what can i do for you ?
need a boat for the summer .
this one will do .
it &apos;s not for rent .
who said anything about renting ?
how much you want for ... &quot; amanda &quot; ?
it &apos;s not for sale , either .
i &apos;m taking it down to haiti next week .
i thought you hated the ocean .
well , i @-@ i spent a lot of time and money working through that ,
amongst other things .
so ...
i &apos;m buying a boat .
right .
just not this one .
amanda must be some special girl .
can i help you with something ?
you don &apos;t like me much ,
do you ?
one more thing for you to work through , i guess .
the response to your &quot; in with the new &quot; memorial day party
has been overwhelming , mrs. grayson .
the party is at 90 % capacity ...
and the &quot; regrets &quot; web site &apos;s
already collected nearly $ 50,000,
for everything from domestic violence prevention
to cancer awareness .
some of these regrets wouldn &apos;t wipe their noses
with $ 50,000 , dear .
if we &apos;re going to set a more generous tone for the summer ,
it &apos;s clear i &apos;m going to have to do something fresh and provocative
so ...
i &apos;ve decided to auction off a piece
from my personal art collection .
what a wild idea , victoria .
well , i don &apos;t care how good the cause is ,
if you put up the van gogh that michael and i gave you ...
i &apos;ll kill myself .
the van gogh is off limits for sentimental reasons .
ashley , would you please add the new announcement
to the web site , see if we can &apos;t drum up some more business ?
and , ladies , thanks again .
lydia ...
we were all so sorry
to hear about you and michael this winter .
you were one of those couples everyone roots for .
i have no doubt .
how are you holding up ?
michael &apos;s threatening to put the beach house on the market
if i don &apos;t release my claim on the west side walk @-@ up .
it &apos;s bad enough , having some stranger renting it out .
i can &apos;t bear the thought of losing it to one of the she @-@ wolves .
mm . well , then don &apos;t let them see your weakness .
it &apos;s the first thing they &apos;ll use against you .
all right ?
thank you .
hey , you want to know a trick ?
yeah .
you plant your feet in the sand
and you stand still through the whole first wave .
okay .
then the next wave &apos;s gonna feel warmer .
and then the one after that &apos;s gonna feel warmer still .
finally , you &apos;re barely gonna notice the cold at all .
are you ready ?
yeah .
here it comes .
you must come from a family of polar bears .
that water is ice cold .
only at first .
after a while , you can &apos;t feel anything .
sounds like my marriage .
you must be the new renter .
emily thorne .
word gets around fast .
like lightning .
i &apos;m lydia davis .
my husband and i own the house you &apos;re staying in .
it &apos;s so nice to meet you .
i can &apos;t tell you how much i love it .
me , too .
some good memories were made there .
well , hopefully i can make some of my own .
so long as we don &apos;t have to take it out of your damage deposit .
welcome to the hamptons .
federal prosecutors wrapped up their case for treason
against disgraced hedge fund executive david clarke .
taking the stand was clarke &apos;s secretary ,
lydia davis ,
whose testimony supported
the damning allegations made by clarke &apos;s former boss ,
conrad grayson .
grayson &apos;s testimony detailed the scheme
clarke used to channel money to the terrorists
responsible for the downing of flight 1 @-@ 9 @-@ 7 .
all 246 americans onboard that flight were killed .
what do you like better , dad ,
sea glass or starfish ?
dad ?
starfish , definitely .
here you go .
thank you .
david , it &apos;s victoria .
hey , do you mind going and looking after sammy for me ?

get your hands off my daughter ! aah ! no !
amanda ! let her go !
amanda ! amanda !
david clarke had everyone fooled ,
including me .
i &apos;m just glad i can help put that monster away .
no one is to approach the head table
unless they &apos;re escorted by either myself or mrs. grayson .
i cannot stress how important that seating chart is .
got it ?
i got it .
good .
at 2 o &apos;clock , security will be
delivering mrs. grayson &apos;s manet
to be set up for auction in the main cabin .
okay ?
ems , please don &apos;t kill me .
well , that depends .
what am i not killing you for ?
standing you up this afternoon .
i have a million @-@ dollar art auction to deal with .
oh , there &apos;s no pressure there .
you want me to pick up your dress for you ?
oh , you &apos;re a lifesaver .
oh , please . i &apos;m sightseeing your working .
i got you covered .
thank you .
bye .
more tea ?
please .
do you think i &apos;m tan enough for my first day on the beach
or do i need another spray ?
what you need is another bathing suit .
compared to what the rest of my friends are wearing ,
this is practically a burka ,
unlike the rest of your friends ...
it &apos;s important to me that you don &apos;t end up
on &quot; page six &quot; at one of diddy &apos;s hot tub parties .
danny &apos;s home .
ooh , danny !

i &apos;m so happy to see you .

jack , will you take care of the mean girls &apos; table ?
it &apos;s too early in the season for me to start making enemies .

because you &apos;re sailing off to save the world ,
and this place can &apos;t afford bad press .
yeah , yeah , i , uh ,
i got it . okay ?

right around the cornor .
i &apos;ll walk you over .

thanks anyway .
all righty , then .
you have a great summer .
hey . oh , my god , conrad .
i thought i was going to find you dead .
i &apos;m fine .
what happened ?
acute abdominal dyspepsia .
the remorse of a guilty stomach .
your staff made it sound as if he was having a heart attack .
well , depending on the severity ,
the symptoms can be identical .
as far as i can tell ,
your husband &apos;s as healthy as a thoroughbred .
but i do suggest that he stay away
from the southfork inn &apos;s spicy bisque for a while .
the southfork inn ?
yeah .
i thought you went golfing .
yeah , i did , earlier .
southfork is a half @-@ hour in the opposite direction .
i &apos;m aware of that .
excuse me .
come on . you know i just get in the way
when you &apos;re planning one of your parties .
i just thought i would go for a drive
and stay out of your hair for a while .
and i &apos;m sorry that i scared you .
don &apos;t do it again .
emily .
you look amazing .
i look amazing ? look at you . look at this party .
congratulations .
well , it &apos;s too early for that . haven &apos;t you seen &quot; titanic &quot; ?
so how well do you know these people ?
well enough to know who to keep away from
and who to snuck up to .
mm . quick tutorial ?
okay .
the girl in the orange escada dress ?
that &apos;s mayor bloomberg &apos;s niece .
and the woman she &apos;s talking to ,
now this one is important--
megan foster .
shoe buyer for barneys of new york .
gray suit boy is kinda cute .
that &apos;s daniel grayson ,
victoria &apos;s tragically privileged spawn .
daniel wrapped his convertible around a tree last summer
after one too many .
didn &apos;t hurt his face much .
yeah , it didn &apos;t work out quite as well
for the waitress he was shagging .
his parents paid off everyone and their mother
to keep him out of jail .
and the plot thickens .
who &apos;s that ?
nolan ross .
former tech boom whiz kid
and perennial pain in the ass .
if you emptied the bank accounts of everyone at this party ,
it wouldn &apos;t add up to the interest he makes in a week .
and that ...
is queen victoria .
wow . hello , nolan .
hello , victoria . how are you ?
i think she spotted you .
good .
introduce us .
hey , how about that stock split , huh ?
what &apos;d i tell you ? turned out great .
conrad .
yeah .
we weren &apos;t sure we were going to see you this afternoon .
huh ? rumor had it that you , uh , really dodged a bullet yesterday .
oh , well , i &apos;m happy to report that the rumors of my demise
are greatly exaggerated .
oh . well , i &apos;m thrilled to hear it .
i &apos;ll be sure to spread the word .
oh , i &apos;m sure you will .
lydia .
i just ...
karrie , you look like you could use another drink .
darling , would you please show her the way to the bar ?
sure .
lydia .
where have you been hiding yourself ?
i left three messages for you .
mrs. grayson , forgive me for interrupting .
i just wanted to introduce you to a dear friend of mine .
victoria grayson , emily thorne .
hello , mrs. grayson .
ah , ms. thorne .
i was wondering who the late entry was
on the guest roster .
well , emily &apos;s new to the hamptons ,
but she really wanted to take part in your fund @-@ raiser .
oh . how do you two know each other ?
we volunteered together at the met this winter .
mm . apparently being a sustaining patron
just wasn &apos;t enough for emily .
mm . i try to give back as much as i can .
lydia . hi .
oh , don &apos;t tell me
you &apos;ve taken up volunteering at the met as well .
emily &apos;s renting my house for the summer .
we met briefly on the beach .
and then yesterday at the southfork inn .
i hope your husband &apos;s feeling better .
victoria , wait .
everyone , listen up , please .
i just want to thank you all for helping the stowaway
kick off the season right .
you &apos;re welcome !
where were you people all winter ?
tomorrow my son jack is setting sail for haiti
to pitch in with the red cross .
good luck , jack !
he wanted to go right after the quake ,
but i convinced him to stick around an extra year
to help me out .
almost two , actually , but who &apos;s counting ?
was it two ?
yeah .
it was two .
good going , jack .
to jack !
to jack !
i &apos;m gonna miss you , son .
i &apos;m gonna miss you , too .
mr. porter , do you have a moment ?
sure . right this way .
the bank is not going to approve any further extensions .
but business is back . all &apos;s i need is 30 more days .
i am sorry . it &apos;s out of my hands .
here we go round again , danny boy ,
summertime in the hamptons .
yep .
same people , same parties ...
same everything .
where do you want to discuss it ?
yo , man .
want to bump it up a notch ?
oh , my god ! wow .
i &apos;m so sorry . god , i &apos;m such an idiot .
no , don &apos;t worry about it .
it &apos;s , uh , probably the universe
telling me i need a costume change .
uh ... i &apos;m daniel .
emily .
how about i get you a dry martini ?
twice the alcohol , half the stain potential .
sure . i &apos;m sorry .
no , no . it &apos;s okay . now wait right here .
how much does he owe ?
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s between your dad and the bank .
come on . he &apos;s owned the place 30 years .
how bad is it ?
the bank &apos;s gonna foreclose at the end of the month .
the only way to stop it now is full payment on arrears .
i am sorry . there &apos;s nothing i can do .
good afternoon , everyone ,
and happy memorial day .
i wanted the theme of today &apos;s party
to signify a fresh start for all of us .
as difficult as the last few years have been ,
they have been devastating on our charities .
but now , as things are beginning to turn around ,
i &apos;m looking forward to giving back ,
and i know that all of you are , too .
so to start things off right ,
i &apos;d like to announce the winner of the art auction ,
my dear friend ...
lydia davis ...
who won &apos;t be going home with the manet this evening ,
but with the treasured van gogh that hangs in my living room .
but i thought the van gogh was a gift from lydia and michael .
have ms. davis escorted off the boat .
and in related news ,
lydia has asked me
to announce that the beach house she shared with her husband
is officially on the market .
ms. davis ...
i &apos;m afraid this will be
her final weekend in the hamptons .
so call your realtors , ladies and gentlemen ,
because this one &apos;s going to go fast .
and , lydia ...
wherever you end up ,
i hope that the van gogh is a constant reminder
of the friendship we shared .
get your hands off my daughter !
i want that kid outta here . now !
give her to social services ! daddy !
amanda !
where are you taking her ? !
no ! daddy !
amanda ! no !
she &apos;s really something , isn &apos;t she ?
my mother .
she sure is .
to chance meetings .
to an unforgettable summer .
how many harvard men does it take
to screw in a lightbulb ?
i don &apos;t know . how many ?
one , and the whole world just revolves around him .
one more ?
drink or joke ?
either . both .
mm . neither .
i am just buzzed enough to find that last joke funny .
one more , and i might think that you meant it .
but don &apos;t let me stop you .
oh , no , no . i &apos;ve had about all the club soda i can take .
you don &apos;t drink ?
used to ...
epically .
i gotta admit , it &apos;s--
it &apos;s nice meeting someone who never knew the old me .
yeah .
i know the feeling .
double infinity .
something like that .
that &apos;s a long time .
daniel ...
your father and i are leaving .
thank you for a lovely party , mrs. grayson .
it was great meeting both of you .
well , now that you &apos;ve moved in next door ,
i suppose we &apos;ll be seeing a lot of you this summer .
i &apos;ll expect you shortly , daniel .
don &apos;t let my mom rattle you .
intimidation is practically a sign of endearment with her .
i &apos;d hate to be on her bad side .
yes , you would .
i should go .
uh , i &apos;m headed your way . you need a ride ?
no , thanks .
maybe next time .
till next time .
you didn &apos;t have to exile her .
what you did was cruel .
oh , what i did was cruel ?
you could have had anyone ,
and you knew she was my closest friend .
it was never meant to be an affair .
oh , it just happened ?
are you physically incapable of
taking responsibility for your actions ?
there is a problem we seem to share .
if you &apos;ll remember , i gave up everything once
to prove how much i love you .
i returned the favor . i helped you destroy a man .
oh , no , no , no . that was your idea , not mine .
you did what you did to save yourself as much as me .
a compromise i &apos;m reminded of every day .
you got plenty in the bargain .
these guys really put the &quot; suck &quot; in seersucker .
what a waste of humanity .
with whom do i have the pleasure of speaking ?
hey . it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s jack porter .
listen , if you still want to buy my boat ,
bring a check down to the docks first thing in the morning .
okay ?
there &apos;s nothing i &apos;d like to do more .
all right . see you then .
welcome home , amanda .
i nearly didn &apos;t recognize you today ,
but that &apos;s the whole point , isn &apos;t it ?
do you know how easy it would be for me to crush your windpipe ?
i don &apos;t think your father would approve .
amanda ...
oh ... your father trusted me .
my father trusted everybody .
what are you doing here , nolan ?
don &apos;t worry . don &apos;t worry . your secret &apos;s safe .
no one wants this imperious cadre
of toxic phonies to eat it more than yours truly .
so how can i be of service ?
you can &apos;t .
you &apos;re not a part of this .
yes , i am .
remember , i witnessed firsthand
what these people did to your father .
they &apos;re hard @-@ core .
i can handle them .
and i have no problem taking you down , too ,
if you get in my way .
i @-@ i don &apos;t want to get in your way .
i want to help you .
you can &apos;t help me , nolan .
suit yourself .
but i can be just as powerful an enemy
as any one of them .
just sayin &apos; .
you might be interested to know ,
i had a nice chat with jack porter tonight .
guess who &apos;s still carrying a torch
for little amanda clarke .
amanda clarke no longer exists .
clarke , happy birthday .
you &apos;ve been emancipated .
amanda clarke .
who are you ?
nolan ross . friend of your father &apos;s .
you &apos;re not exactly the little angel he described .
my father hasn &apos;t seen me in ten years .
i &apos;m sorry to be the one to tell you .
he passed away .
six weeks ago .
he wanted you to have something .
whatever that is , i don &apos;t want it .
oh , no , no , no , trust me . you definitely do .
my father was a murderer and a liar .
so why would i trust you , huh ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s just what they want you to believe .
forget everything that you think you know , amanda .
your dad was protecting you .
from what ?
open the box .
find out .
your father was the first person to believe in me .
he invested in my company when no one else would .
that key , it opens a lock box in zurich .
now that you &apos;re 18,
you &apos;re officially
49 % owner of my company .
board meetings are every other wednesday , but ...
you don &apos;t have to show up .
i never do .
&quot; my dear amanda ...
if you &apos;re reading this ,
then two things have come to pass .
i am finally able to provide you the life
you were unjustly denied .
and sadly , i won &apos;t be able
to share that life with you .
i hope these journals provide answers
to the questions you &apos;ve had all these years .
i am not the man they say i am .
and i did not do the things they say i did .
all i ask is that you promise to do the one thing .
that &apos;s been so hard for me to do .
forgive . &quot;
but that was a promise
i couldn &apos;t keep .
when deception cuts this deep ,
someone has to pay .
my father &apos;s chance
to bring justice to the truly guilty was stolen from him .
his only option was to forgive .
i have others .
would you set it up by the windows , please ?
and i &apos;d like some , uh , pepper in my bisque .
they say vengeance is a dish best served cold .
but sometimes it &apos;s as warm as a bowl of soup .
my father died an innocent man ,
betrayed by the woman he loved .
when everything you love has been stolen from you ,
sometimes all you have left is revenge .
like i said ...
this is not a story about forgiveness .
yes ?
i want you to find out everything you can
about a young woman named emily thorne .
emily thorne ?
