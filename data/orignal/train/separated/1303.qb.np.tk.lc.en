and it &apos;s the annual boston police department salute to heroes tonight .
boston homicide detective jane rizzoli ,
who was badly injured in a siege
at headquarters three months ago , will be honored ,
along with army private abby sherman ,
just 22 years old .
sherman &apos;s story made headlines
when her platoon was ambushed in afghanistan .
she was shot but crawled to a machine gun
to save three members of her squad .
oh , turn him on his side !
what &apos;s happening ? !
his lung is filling up with blood .
&quot; detective jane rizzoli was the youngest officer
to ever be promoted to the rank of detective . &quot;
go !
shoot him ! just shoot him !
you look terrible .
thank you .
you &apos;re making everyone late .
even you would look bad if a bullet had gone through you .
laceration to your peritoneum and small bowel
could explain your jaundiced color .
okay , you may not casually discuss my privates .
three months .
you could have read all of shakespeare .
you know ? learned finnish ?
instead , you &apos;ve become a platinum member
of the shopping channel .
oh , i swear to god , if you start cleaning ,
i will kick you out .
is that why you banned your mother ?
is that what she said ?
did she mention
that all of her ocd banging and clanking around isn &apos;t restful ?
what , finnish ? like , finland finnish ?
you know , the stress hormone cortisol
suppresses your immune cells &apos; ability
to activate telomerase .
so you say . mine are fine .
quite simply , keeping your brain busy aids recovery .
mind , body ...
mind business .
you are my business .
come on . give me that . here we go .
ooh . ow . stop . no . maura , i &apos;m not going .
well , what , you -- you still have pain ?
no . i just like saying &quot; ow . &quot;
could be from intermittent obstruction due to adhesions .
when was your last bowel movement ?
you just can &apos;t help yourself , can you ?
i think you &apos;re avoiding .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a get @-@ well present from korsak and frost .
that &apos;s restful ? where is your uniform ?
oh ! it is disgusting in here !
put this on .
makes me look like a man .
we can do this the easy way or the hard way .
i &apos;m not a hero , maura .
shooting yourself is not heroic .
the people of boston think it is .
eight people died . i don &apos;t want a medal for that .
five of them were bad guys , jane .
whatever .
this ceremony isn &apos;t for you .
this is -- this is for your fellow officers
and your parents and your community .
you &apos;re a symbol .
you are a heroic flesh @-@ and @-@ blood reminder
of the thin blue line .
that &apos;s good .
you almost had me .
okay .
the hard way .
boston p.d. and the u.s. military
honoring their own tonight .
private first class abby sherman &apos;s support squad
was headed to a rendezvous with my platoon
to rearm and resupply us ,
when her truck was hit by an rpg .
she was shot , she crawled to a saw ,
firing round after round at taliban militia .
because of her courage , these three men are alive today .
congratulations .
see ? that &apos;s a hero .
shh .
detective jane rizzoli was the first female officer
to work in the drug @-@ control unit .
she was also the youngest officer ever
to be promoted to the rank of detective .
i knew she had more balls than any guy on the job .
ladies and gentlemen , detective jane rizzoli .
jane ?
jane .
say something uplifting .
can you just hand it to me ?
stand still , rizzoli , or i &apos;ll pin it on your forehead .
say a few words .
guys , uh , i didn &apos;t really prepare anything .
um , just &apos; cause -- &apos; cause i -- i --
i don &apos;t really think of myself as a hero .
most of you -- you know my -- my little brother , frankie .
frankie , just stand up and help me out .
um , frankie is alive because of dr. maura isles .
you know , she normally works on dead people .
he &apos;s alive because of her , not -- not because of me .
i , uh ...
i @-@ i was just doing my job . you know ?
um , i -- we -- we all do this job
because it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s what we &apos;ve been trained to do .
you know , we -- we &apos;ve been trained
not to think of ourselves but to act ,
because , you know , life is unfair and ...
and bad things happen , and ...
you know , i think that we &apos;re here --
we &apos;re all here ...
... to remind everybody
that , uh , sometimes the good guys still win .
thank you very much .
it &apos;s all right .
thanks .
where &apos;s my dad ?
jane ?
casey ?
h @-@ hi .
hi . how are you ? what are you doing here ?
you don &apos;t come to the high @-@ school reunions .
wanted to see how you turned out .
you came from afghanistan to see how i turned out ?
everyone on leave got an invite .
thought it &apos;d be fun to see you .
you look great .
lieutenant colonel , delta force .
that -- that &apos;s impressive .
um , you know what , i want to talk to you .
can you -- can you give me a sec ?
sure .
it &apos;s good to see you .
that was a good speech , jane .
i didn &apos;t see dad . where is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , jane . i &apos;m so proud of you .
thanks , ma .
thank you . where &apos;s daddy ?
ma ...
what is the matter ? ma , okay .
sit down , ma .
yeah , there you go . okay .
are you -- ma ?
uh , uh , i need a pen .
what &apos;s wrong ?
okay . i need a pen !
she gets very emotional and then she can &apos;t talk ,
so we have her write it down .
okay , hang on .
here , here . here , here . write it down .
okay . okay , here . ma ?
&quot; divorce . &quot;
detective , congratulations .
can you do a quick interview with us --
how it feels to be a hero ?
fantastic .
great .
could you give me a second ? please .
sure .
thank you .
you know , she -- she gets very emotional when --
when she &apos;s proud .
ma , let -- it &apos;s gonna be okay , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
look , let frankie take you home , okay ?
come on .
what ?
&quot; we are getting divorced . &quot;
that &apos;s terrible .
this should come out .
oh , god .
you were in mogadishu , sir ?
haiti in &apos; 94 , yugoslavia in &apos; 99 .
you &apos;re back .
yes .
i loved your speech .
i loved your heroism . it puts me to shame .
nice talking to you , sir .
no , let me get you guys a drink .
nothing for me , thanks .
doctor says water or prune juice .
sexy .
we dated in high school .
see gary ? we enlisted together .
oh , wow . you came back together .
war isn &apos;t good for a relationship .
i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;re still friends .
do they resent you ?
i mean , the other detectives .
it &apos;s that bad , huh ?
got a lot worse after all this hero b.s.
they hurt , don &apos;t they ?
i can still feel the bullet .
the doctors left it there .
i wish scars looked good on girls .
well , there &apos;s something good about ugly scars .
you can &apos;t pretend it didn &apos;t happen .
are you gonna go back ?
i &apos;ve been asking myself that a lot lately .
i &apos;m done . i did my last tour .
i &apos;m a civilian after tonight .
you take care , okay ?
you too .
fresh out of prune juice .
ugh , slucky . can the night get any worse ?
thanks .
except for you .
this is my trauma surgeon .
luckily , i was under when we hung out together .
watch this . everything is the royal &quot; we . &quot;
serious . watch .
hey . hi . so , how are we feeling , jane ?
we are feeling fine ,
but we can &apos;t speak for everyone .
all the single guys in boston
and you got to date ucky slucky ?
don &apos;t refer to byron that way .
it &apos;s unethical , maura .
why ? he was your doctor , not mine .
i mean , he &apos;s very sexy .
he has an odd accent , though .
yeah , he moved here from england when he was a kid .
hmm . i nearly lost my virginity to him .
you know , byron is much better when he &apos;s not talking , jane .
i think you would really like him .
oh , i like byron ... when i &apos;m anesthetized .
your turtle has a better bedside manner .
tortoise .
and i don &apos;t disagree with you ,
which is why it was a wonderful surprise to find out
that he was very tender when he wasn &apos;t by the bed ,
but in the bed .
that &apos;s like thinking about my parents having sex .
my parents are getting a divorce .
i know . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so sorry .
th-- ugh . this is just too much crap .
i need to learn how to compartmentalize .
you know , how do men do it ?
well , they simply separate everything
into isolated compartments .
thank you .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s very helpful .
please , go have tender sex with byron ,
and i &apos;m going home .
you know , you do need to boost your immune system ,
and sex is very good for that .
thank you , doctor .
i was married for a while .
she was a west pointer , too .
it didn &apos;t work out .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
so , how come we never finished what we started ?
because you didn &apos;t give me the time of day
until senior week .
i was a jerk .
well , you were just too cool for me .
and smart .
truth ?
you were too scary for me .
gee , thanks .
i looked cool ,
but i was like 12 in boy years .
you were a force even then . smart , beautiful .
didn &apos;t care what anybody thought of you .
bye .
inside , i was a geek .
come on ! come on .
abby
there might be a second bomb .
well , we need to help her .
she &apos;s gone . come on .
get the bomb squad out here !
move back !
secure the building ! i &apos;ll get the soldiers to help !
perimeter !
jane , are you okay ? !
keep everyone back !
i want a perimeter now !
back it up !
i got this .
got her ?
private first class sherman was in that car !
was she by herself ?
yes .
rizzoli , need you out of here .
you &apos;re not cleared for duty .
dr. isles , we &apos;re gonna need you .
frankie ! get her home !
yeah .
don &apos;t need no more casualties .
i want to help . i want to help .
you all right ? come on , come on .
get out of here !
vince , be careful .
i can &apos;t get in it !
i can &apos;t believe it . abby died right in front of me .
i can stay .
i &apos;m okay .
all right .
and they &apos;re gonna want all hands on deck .
i &apos;m just gonna make sure you &apos;re okay before i go .
you gonna watch me brush my teeth ?
yep .
he left a message .
&quot; hey , honey , sorry i can &apos;t be there . -- dad . &quot;
that &apos;s not like him .
or did i also suffer brain damage
what ? janie ... he moved out today .
what ? how do you know ?
she told me .
did you see this coming ?
i guess it &apos;s been coming for a long time .
they were fighting a lot at the hospital .
well , we both almost died .
yeah ,
and even that didn &apos;t bring them together .
but to move out ? why so fast ?
they &apos;re losing the house .
what ?
yeah , ma said that they &apos;ve been living off a second mortgage .
house is for sale .
man , i have been out of it .
go .
you want be a detective .
they &apos;re gonna want everybody looking for bomb parts , okay ?
all right . - okay , i --
i &apos;m gonna go to sleep . i just ...
i just want to forget about today .
just promise me you &apos;ll stay put ?
hey . come on .
there . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
wow . detective rizzoli .
you &apos;re new .
yeah , i &apos;m , um , uh ...
officer reynolds .
yeah .
it &apos;s a pleasure to meet you , really .
uh , i can &apos;t let you in without a badge . sorry .
oh , come on , i got -- there &apos;s my badge . oh .
we got a tough case to solve .
uh , no , i can &apos;t .
uh , security &apos;s been really tight since ...
since me .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m trying to figure out who killed abby sherman .
we haven &apos;t cleared you yet .
are you sure you &apos;re ready for this , jane ?
i &apos;m sure that i &apos;m done sitting on my ass .
here . clear me for active duty .
call darlene in my office , make an appointment .
see you later .
oh , yeah , he &apos;s so tender .
i don &apos;t know how i never noticed . get me in there .
ane , go home . get better .
maura , you heard me . this is who i am .
this i what i do . now , get me in there .
okay , fine .
but i &apos;m only doing this
because i &apos;m afraid that you &apos;re gonna hurt yourself
or this nice officer .
it &apos;s okay , sam .
detective rizzoli is with me .
yes , ma &apos;am .
really ?
downstairs only .
i will poke you in your scar tissue
if you even touch the &quot; up &quot; arrow .
that &apos;s a sign of sexual frustration .
or ... tangled hair .
i can &apos;t stop seeing abby &apos;s face .
it looks different in here .
that is correct , rip van winkle .
and wait till you see my office .
the decorator just finished .
oh , my god , i &apos;m so excited ,
i might need a paper bag .
you know , it &apos;s possible
a .40 @-@ caliber bullet went through me , maura .
my attitude isn &apos;t faking that .
you &apos;re not faking anything .
you had a life @-@ threatening injury .
but you &apos;re strong , healthy .
something &apos;s gotten in the way of your healing .
ow ! will you please stop doing that ?
i just wish i knew what was causing that pain .
again , i &apos;m going with the .40 @-@ caliber bullet , but ...
are you sure you want to be here ?
she was very badly burned .
are those her dog tags ?
she survives two tours in afghanistan
and gets blown up at home .
thank you .
mm . i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t , i can &apos;t .
what the hell is wrong with me ?
i &apos;ve been through worse than this .
and abby deserves better .
jane , take a deep breath .
no , i can &apos;t . it hurts .
what if i &apos;m never who i was .
that &apos;s the human condition .
thanks . really upbeat .
oh . ow ! this hurts , too .
how uncomfortable is this ?
how can you say that ?
that &apos;s a karim rashid label .
oh , well , in that case ,
it &apos;s like the warm caress of a mother &apos;s hand .
your parasympathetic nerve is in overdrive .
it &apos;s a protective mechanism .
what , because i don &apos;t like your office ?
did taxpayers pay for this ?
of course not .
you know , you might still be in physical pain
because of a posttraumatic psychopathological reaction
to what &apos;s happened to you .
well , make it stop .
what do you do when fear is killing you ?
well , it &apos;s very hard to die from fear
unless you have a congenital heart condition .
what can i do ?
get me upstairs .
rizzoli , what the hell ? i gave you an order .
i know , i know , i know . i &apos;m sorry .
please reinstate me .
okay , just -- just for this case . - you know the routine .
you get your doctor to sign off , and then i sign off .
you &apos;re still paying me , lieutenant . all right ?
i want to help .
i want to do this for abby . please .
okay , you can stick around ,
but you &apos;re off the books until
i get a signed release .
no gun , no badge .
understood . thank you .
hey ! great to have you back .
say hello to your new sergeant .
you &apos;re a threesome now .
you okay over here ?
you see , we -- we moved .
you do this ?
i -- i -- i did , i did .
welcome back , jane .
thank you .
how you doing with him being sergeant ?
i got a choice ?
okay , let &apos;s get to it . bring me up to speed .
our bomb squad and the fbi are still there .
we helped them do a line search , hands and knees .
found the explosives casing .
homeland security is sending over a team .
i just talked to the governor .
was it terrorists ?
well , that &apos;s the speculation .
anything to suggest it was homegrown ?
looks like common components .
bomb techs found large @-@ diameter pipe .
it was a pipe bomb .
she got any family here in boston ?
only child of a single mom .
she &apos;s been in the army for four years .
we &apos;re digging , though .
she was discharged two weeks ago .
she was staying with her mom .
oh , god . was her mother there ?
uh , yeah .
uh , w @-@ what about personal ?
abby said the men in her platoon resented her .
no way .
korsak , with all due respect ,
there weren &apos;t women serving when you were a marine .
hey , i ever treat you any different
from frost , rizzoli ?
well , yeah . you never brought me flowers .
detective frost , turn up the volume , please .
and our top story -- a car explosion
has taken the life of a young female u.s. soldier .
the question now , is this a terrorist attack ?
all right , let &apos;s investigate her military history --
find out who she was stationed with ,
see if she got any disciplinary reports
from m.p.s , anything .
yeah , you met lieutenant colonel jones .
he &apos;s army special ops . he &apos;s got a stake in this .
okay , well , get him in here .
why hasn &apos;t some group claimed responsibility ?
terrorists are the first to pick up the phone
and get the credit .
she &apos;s been in afghanistan
for the last four years . what about her unit ?
maybe somebody she was stationed with wanted her dead .
there &apos;s no way it &apos;s a fragging .
i &apos;m not saying it is ,
but we have to at least consider the possibility
that it could be a fellow soldier .
well , if it &apos;s a soldier , the army wants to know .
i want to know .
that looks like part of a switch .
yeah . it &apos;s a mercury switch .
you have a list of the chemical components
in the explosives yet ?
yeah , right here .
traces of powdered aluminum , magnesium ,
potassium chlorate , and sulfur .
no trace of octol , which is only used by us .
it &apos;s not a soldier .
okay , i don &apos;t want it to be a soldier either ,
but we can &apos;t rule that out .
so , how many from her squad
were in boston when she was killed ?
only the three guys that survived ,
plus , uh , her platoon leader , lieutenant forman .
well , let &apos;s go talk to them .
uh ... give me a second right .
scar tissue .
formed around a foreign object in abby &apos;s shoulder .
that must be the bullet .
abby said they left it in .
why wouldn &apos;t army doctors take it out ?
could have been too close to the brachial plexus , maybe .
i &apos;ll process it .
let me know ?
abby said you were high @-@ school sweethearts .
yeah .
stayed best friends .
and you were with her ...
the whole way .
abby was driving the deuce and a half .
i was riding shotgun .
orders were to meet up , resupply ammo and parts .
heard the sound of an rpg as it was being launched ,
then boom .
flips that 2.1 / 2 @-@ ton truck like it &apos;s a kid &apos;s toy .
insurgents are firing at us .
i &apos;m pinned in the truck . i can &apos;t get to the saw .
we &apos;re all dead men .
private sherman is hit .
but she makes it to the saw ,
lays down covering fire .
she saved all of them .
she was support .
wasn &apos;t supposed to be anywhere near combat .
guys teased her because she was -
she was kind of girly .
i knew she was tough .
did you do any more than just resupply runs with her ?
no .
no , that day ...
when it counted ...
she lived up to my highest ideal .
she was a soldier . that &apos;s what she was .
she was ...
a damn fine soldier .
i &apos;m sorry the mess .
oh , i don &apos;t mind . i &apos;ve been living in a tent .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be drinking prune juice ?
not after this .
i keep thinking about what abby said
about her squad resented her .
did you pick that up from any of them ?
no .
those were soldiers mourning one of their own .
it &apos;s got to be terrorism .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m over there ,
to keep it from happening over here .
we have the best bomb guys in the country working on it .
we &apos;ll get them .
yeah .
want to know something crazy ?
yeah , lay it on me .
i was thinking , except for the girly part ...
... abby was like you .
well , i &apos;m honored .
except for the girly part .
i can be girly .
no . i always liked your toughness .
you &apos;re a -- you &apos;re a soft @-@ shelled crab , rizzoli .
a not @-@ girly @-@ crab . wow .
hard on the outside , soft on the inside .
no ?
no . no .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re such an incredible cop .
because you care so damn much .
maybe too much .
you can &apos;t care too much .
30 years , i &apos;ve been picking up that man &apos;s socks ,
cooking without spices because it gave him indigestion .
hey , mrs. rizzoli .
hello , charles .
come on , ma !
just for once in my life , could you please knock ? !
so , too sick to wash the dishes
but not too sick to have intercourse ?
intercourse , ma ? come on .
we didn &apos;t sleep together . okay , yes , we slept --
why am i having this conversation ?
i gave you a key for emergencies only .
yeah , it was an emergency .
the health department was gonna come and condemn the place .
i made you breakfast .
thank you .
i heard you were selling the house .
yeah , thanks to your father .
ma , i &apos;m so sorry . what happened ?
he left me .
he left me with nothing .
i gave him my best years .
okay , come on . you have plenty of good years left .
all right ?
and you got me , you got frankie , you got tommy .
tommy who &apos;s in prison ?
he &apos;s getting out soon , ma .
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s been writing me letters .
he &apos;s doing really good .
why didn &apos;t daddy come to the ceremony ?
i asked him not to ,
because i didn &apos;t want you to have to arrest me if he did .
why ? what did he do ?
jane , he ...
he wants a change .
i want a change , too .
but you don &apos;t see me walking out on him .
you can stay here as long as you like .
you can -- you can have my bedroom .
not gonna impose . i can &apos;t .
you wouldn &apos;t be imposing .
that &apos;s very nice of you .
thank you .
but , uh , dr . isles offered me her guest house .
what ?
i &apos;m a good guest .
are you a masochist ?
you bought this house for your mother to visit , not mine .
increased blood flow . rush of endorphins .
you feel less pain today , don &apos;t you ?
what are you talking about ?
you had sex .
and we did not have s-- i mean , we almost had --
it &apos;s really none of your business ,
but feel free to chat about it with my mother
at your slumber parties .
i never really got much sleep at slumber parties .
why ? why are you doing this ?
because she &apos;s your family .
i feel guilty .
catholic guilt .
did you know that a university of parma study
found that devout catholics
are more likely to show signs of ocd ?
yeah , mart luther &apos;s strict definition of the sacraments
is too constraining .
i hated confession .
did you have a lot to confess to ?
i made stuff up .
because if you confess to sins that you &apos;re not sorry for ,
then that &apos;s a sin .
isn &apos;t making up sins a sin ?
how are we this morning ?
i called darlene in your office .
she said you were too busy to squeeze me in .
yeah , we are rather busy .
and so are you . i &apos;ll be waiting outside .
i &apos;d like to discuss your pathology findings .
morning .
vomit .
i &apos;m worried about her .
she still has pain . shouldn &apos;t she be healed ?
hmm , patients heal at different rates .
but you don &apos;t know her .
you know , she had a dislocated shoulder
and she still tackled a 200 @-@ pound suspect to the ground .
are we questioning my opinion ?
well , there could be another component .
the mind is powerful . she had a trauma .
um , you &apos;re merely a pathologist ,
and she had expert care from a renowned trauma surgeon .
are you talking about yourself in the third person ?
are we angry ?
we are .
but ...
thank you for reminding me why i don &apos;t date surgeons .
that &apos;s what was inside the scar tissue in abby &apos;s shoulder .
0.38 @-@ caliber bullet from an american revolver .
aw , no . friendly fire .
don &apos;t you think it has to be ?
can you get inside of her medical records ?
maura , what can you tell us about her gunshot wound ?
that would just be my opinion .
pretend i &apos;m a priest and i can &apos;t tell anyone .
i &apos;m not catholic .
it is my opinion that she was facing her shooter
when she was shot from no more than 6 feet away .
it &apos;s based on the --
the scarring around the entrance wound .
so she would have seen her shooter .
can &apos;t be . can &apos;t . why would she lie ?
she says right here , &quot; i was
shot by a taliban insurgent . &quot; nothing &apos;s been redacted .
okay , i &apos;m not saying there &apos;s some big cover @-@ up
by the department of evil .
all right ? i &apos;m a cop .
i &apos;m practically a soldier myself .
look at this .
it says that abby refused to let them remove the bullet .
yeah , maybe because she didn &apos;t want them
finding an american soldier &apos;s bullet in her body .
oh , this is all speculation .
casey , she lied . why ?
jane , maybe , maybe she was afraid .
of what ?
soldiers know --
hell , everybody knows -- it &apos;s war .
friendly fire happens .
it &apos;s tragic . but when it does , we admit it .
tell that to pat tillman &apos;s family .
i said i &apos;d help you , and i will .
not like this .
casey .
that was awkward .
you think ?
what -- w @-@ what are you doing ?
i want to talk to gary ,
the private that was with her when she was shot .
they were high @-@ school sweethearts .
hi , private campbell ?
yes , hi , this is detective rizzoli .
um , i -- i have a few more questions for you .
i was just wondering ...
today would be fantastic .
perfect . right now .
all right , thanks .
you &apos;re not cleared for active duty .
i &apos;m going with you .
you &apos;re not a detective .
oh , well , technically , neither are you .
i &apos;d like that folder back .
private campbell ?
maura , you okay ?
i don &apos;t think this is just about abby .
you were damn lucky .
glad you &apos;re okay .
every soldier who knows the truth
about what happened to abby is in danger .
what do you mean ?
abby was shot by a friendly in afghanistan .
you knew ?
are you part of a cover @-@ up , private ?
i was following orders .
whose orders ?
lieutenant forman &apos;s .
forman was special operations group .
he can carry anything he wants .
including a 0.38 revolver .
i &apos;m next , aren &apos;t i ?
not if we can help it .
look at his record . it &apos;s outstanding .
there &apos;s no way it &apos;s him .
abby was outstanding , too ,
except she was enlisted , not an officer .
hey , guys , sorry .
i tracked powdered sulfur from the bombings
back to a chemical @-@ supply store .
look who signed the receipt .
forman &apos;s due back at fort bragg in north carolina in 5 days .
yeah , he rented a house in boston two weeks ago .
got a signed lease .
right when abby was discharged .
forman was in combat for the first time , right ?
maybe he panics , shoots abby .
then she turns out to be a hero ,
but as long as he &apos;s her commander ,
he can keep her quiet .
but then she applies for a discharge .
maybe he follows her here .
afraid she &apos;ll talk , or maybe one of her squad will .
you think he started killing the soldiers
he led into battle to save his career ?
got another explanation
for purchasing this much stuff to make bombs ?
we got to get to that house .
i &apos;ll get on the hook ,
get s.w.a.t. to meet us out there .
i &apos;ll drag the entry team out of bed .
you &apos;re welcome to come .
stay here , jane . stay safe .
we &apos;ll have a live feed .
tango leader . squad one in position .
tango leader to squad two , confirm position .
i &apos;m like a boxer with a glass jaw .
i mean , have you ever seen me not able to step up ?
the most powerful force of nature is not a nuclear weapon .
when i talk , do you hear ,
&quot; blah , blah , blah , maura , blah , blah , blah &quot; ?
it &apos;s thoughts .
that &apos;s the most powerful force -- your thoughts .
job used to take my mind off of everything .
i mean , it &apos;s like i &apos;m not who i am anymore .
okay , just do me a favor , all right ?
close your eyes .
close them .
take a deep breath .
ugh . i can &apos;t .
go to full position , tango one , on my command .
trip wire ! everybody out !
fall back , fall back ! move , move !
fricking tragedy all around .
blew himself up before we could get there .
well , at least he didn &apos;t take anybody else with him .
i &apos;m gonna tell private campbell myself .
he should know this is over .
okay , i &apos;ll tag along for moral support .
compression fracture .
why was he wearing abby &apos;s dog tags ?
forman , sherman .
she was wearing his .
so , lieutenant forman killed abby .
that &apos;s just hard to believe .
um , excuse me .
yeah ?
jane , forman was killed by a blow to the back of the head
before the explosion .
you sure ?
yes , yes .
he was dead before the blast .
so , he was framed by the killer .
lieutenant forman and abby sherman were lovers .
oh , crap .
jane , what is it ?
thank you ... gary .
it &apos;s gary .
i &apos;m calling for backup !
thanks .
it &apos;s too bad you know your guns , detective .
bit of a gun enthusiast , huh , gary ?
you shot abby .
that was an accident . i didn &apos;t know it was her .
i -- i heard movement .
and you pulled the trigger , private .
she covered it up to protect you .
i loved her .
what did you blow her up for ?
she wasn &apos;t gonna expose you .
because ...
because &quot; war isn &apos;t good for relationships . &quot;
this was never about the war .
this was about lieutenant forman .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s dead , too .
yeah , they -- they -- they thought i didn &apos;t know ?
they were fraternizing !
yeah , that &apos;s right .
he was her superior officer .
that &apos;s a -- that &apos;s a court @-@ martial offense .
it wasn &apos;t an accident in afghanistan .
you tried to kill abby .
they just thought that they were just gonna get out of the army
and live happily ever after ?
no .
no , wait .
wait . oh .
just wait a minute , all right ?
and -- and that &apos;s why he d a house here ,
to be closer to her .
i get it . i get that .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
i got no choice .
no , no , you have a choice . just face what you &apos;ve done .
okay . give it to me .
that &apos;s all right .
that &apos;s okay .
&quot; you &apos;re my hero . &quot;
mine , too .
i know why we never got together .
you still scare me ...
as much as this thing .
i scare you ?
i got to say goodbye .
why ? where you going ?
my leave &apos;s up .
i &apos;ve loved seeing you .
i loved seeing you .
show up at the next reunion . we &apos;ll finish what we started .
doctor .
you know , heroes are actually social deviants .
the famous zimbardo experiment at yale proved that .
he &apos;s going back to afghanistan .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , it &apos;s good .
i was so scared , maura , and i did it anyway .
that &apos;s the definition of a hero .
who &apos;s a social deviant .
it &apos;s not a bad thing .
right , so , i &apos;m a not @-@ girly ,
crabby social deviant .
that &apos;s great .
um , can i just ...
take a deep breath .
any pain ?
no .
i &apos;m back .
you &apos;re back .
i &apos;m back !
you know , i was pretty sure that it was psychosomatic .
it was so not psychosomatic .
no , i think it was .
you think ? so , you were guessing ?
no , no , i can think .
i can consider , i can conclude .
yeah , no , that &apos;s guessing .
you guessed .
no , i did not .
dr. isles guessed , dr. isles guessed .
i did not .
