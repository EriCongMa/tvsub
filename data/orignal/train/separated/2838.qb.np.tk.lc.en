oh , man !
what &apos;s that ?
treeger &apos;s snaking the shower drain .
what in the name of hell ?
maybe he found your flip @-@ flop .
is this porn ?
i must have hit something on the remote .
do we pay for this ?
we didn &apos;t even pay our cable bill .
maybe this is how they punish us .
maybe we shouldn &apos;t pay our phone bill . free phone sex .
maybe we shouldn &apos;t pay our gas bill .
hey , that lady &apos;s all kinds of naked .
joey pressed something on the remote and it just came on .
it happened to me once .
it was like finding money.finding money with naked people on it !
but i made the mistake of turning off the tv.i never got it back again .
and i &apos;m sad .
why would he turn off the tv ?
the one with the free porn
do we really have to watch this while we eat ?
we don &apos;t know what could make this go away .
so no one touches the remote , and no one touches the tv .
and no one touches the air around the tv .
imagine a protective porn bubble , if you will .
i &apos;m at least going to mute it .
we still have porn .
what are you doing ? that &apos;s too heavy . give it here .
oh , god .
i &apos;m too pregnant for lugging around a stupid massage table .
i need a job with a smaller table .
or a job without a table .
you mean , like a doctor ?
you &apos;re blocking the porn !
that reminds me . i have to see my ob @-@ gyn today .
emily just went to the airport .
why didn &apos;t you take her ?
her uncle had planned to do it.we said our goodbyes this morning .
you must feel horrible . hey , the guys have free porn .
hey , cheer up . you &apos;ll see her again , right ?
i don &apos;t know.when i brought it up , she said ...
... &quot; this is so fantastic . why talk about the future ?
let &apos;s enjoy &quot;
don &apos;t do the accent . it really bums me out .
emily said i was pretty good.well , that &apos;s someone you should hang on to .
you &apos;ve got to see her again .
why do you care ?
because ! you could live out my fantasy .
you had fantasies about emily ?
you know , the fantasy .
meet a foreigner , fall madly in love and spend your lives together .
is that why you hung out with that ukrainian kid in school ?
yeah , plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything .
do you love her ?
we said it would only be two weeks .
you love her .
what is love , really ?
i knew you loved her !
you go to the airport and tell her .
you &apos;ll probably catch her at the gate .
you &apos;ll call her name and yell &quot; l love you ! &quot;
she &apos;ll say &quot; l love you too ! &quot;
then you will have the most amazing kiss.everyone at the gate will applaud .
i am a good kisser .
then you two can sneak into the cockpit .
things will start to heat up .
and then a stewardess comes in ....
i &apos;ve been watching too much porn .
ls that the heartbeat ?
that &apos;s it .
oh , my god !
this is so cool !
have we talked about multiple births ?
let &apos;s take care of this one . if l get pregnant again , i have your card .
no , i &apos;m getting three separate heartbeats .
you guys were worried i wouldn &apos;t even have one .
doctors are wrong all the time .
are you sure that there are three ? -definitely .
oh , my god .
so in a few months , i &apos;ll have three babies walking around inside me ?
it &apos;ll be like one of those log rides when they come shooting out .
giving birth to three is like giving birth to one .
what do you know ?
have you ever had triplets ?
no . i &apos;m sorry , i haven &apos;t .
i &apos;m going to use this a lot .
phoebe
how &apos;d it go at the doctor &apos;s ?
you know how , when you &apos;re walking down the street ... and you see three people in a row .
and you say &quot; oh , that &apos;s nice . &quot;
good news ! you &apos;ll have three babies .
three babies ?
i &apos;ve finally got my band !
we &apos;ll have a big family ! i always wanted a big family .
oh , god , i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re happy ! i was afraid you &apos;d be freaked .
why would we be freaked ?
because it &apos;s harder to raise them and the added expense .
right .
no , back to happy . back to happy !
it &apos;s going to be fine ... because i teach home ec .
i can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long .
it &apos;ll be like my very own little sweatshop .
i was thinking , ever since you said we &apos;d have triplets .
the best thing for me to do is drop out of college and get a job .
no , you can &apos;t quit college .
you &apos;re in college ?
refrigerator college .
when we found out we were having a baby ...
... i figured i should have a career , you know ?
and i love refrigerators .
you can &apos;t give up on your dream !
no , it &apos;s okay . we &apos;re going to have three kids .
and that &apos;s a different kind of dream .
three kids and no money .
this is the boarding call for flight 009 .
what are you doing here ?
i had to see you before you took off .
you are so sweet .
that &apos;s a big candy bar .
i had the most amazing time with you.me too .
this is the final boarding call for flight 009 .
well , that &apos;s me .
here , have this.i &apos;m only allowed one piece of carry @-@ on .
wait
listen , i have to tell you something .
i &apos;ve been thinking.i &apos;m just going to say it , okay ?
i think ... i love you .
thank you .
it &apos;s no problem .
what is that song ? it &apos;s the theme from good will humping .
you know who doesn &apos;t like dirty movies ? my boyfriend joshua .
yeah , right .
he said he prefers to leave certain things to the imagination .
did he also say that the dialogue was corny ?
and that he found it funny , not sexy ?
yes .
yeah , he likes porn .
where you going ?
to find out if he really thinks models are too skinny .
how &apos;d it go ?
frank has to quit college ... because his super @-@ fertile sister &apos;s having three babies .
i need to make money fast .
i wanted to talk to you about an idea.you work for a big company .
insider trading .
what information can you give me ?
they don &apos;t talk to us about that stuff.but i can get you free white @-@ out .
did you do what i said ?
i did .
what &apos;d she say ?
&quot; thank you . &quot;
you &apos;re totally welcome . what &apos;d she say ?
she said , &quot; thank you . &quot;
i said , &quot; l love you . &quot; and she said , &quot; thank you . &quot;
that &apos;s not right .
did you say you love her ? what were you trying to get her to do ?
what do i do now ?
you play hard @-@ to @-@ get .
she already lives in london .
so you go to tokyo .
forget it.you told her you love her . it &apos;s over .
it is not over ! you &apos;re over !
what ?
you know .
okey , good one .
it &apos;s not over . she &apos;ll call and tell you she loves you .
her feelings were so strong that it scared her .
go home and wait for her call . she could call from the plane .
go go go.-okey !
but if she doesn &apos;t call , it is definitely over !
unless , eventually , i call her to see what &apos;s going on ...
... and she says she &apos;ll call me back , but then she doesn &apos;t .
then it &apos;s over !
way to be strong !
can we watch cartoons on your tv ? we need a porn break .
we spent two hours watching in and out and in again .
why don &apos;t you turn it off ? then we &apos;d be the guys who turned off free porn
yeah , but that &apos;s not what you &apos;d go by .
look , i &apos;m going to have a kid someday . okay ?
and someday that kid is going to ask me if i ever turned off free porn .
i don &apos;t wanna have to tell him that i did .
did you ever asked you dad that ? i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
good , you &apos;re here !
what you got there ? this ? i &apos;m glad you asked .
don &apos;t you hate to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife ?
i know what you &apos;re thinking.pregnant woman slays four ?
did they make you pay for those knives ?
no .
are you sure ?
no .
you won &apos;t make enough money by selling knives .
i just need enough money for the second part of my plan .
what &apos;s that ?
my saturn dealership .
ross .
emily . hi .
how was your flight ? it was dreadful .
it was terrible how i acted when you said those wonderful things .
no , that &apos;s all right.i &apos;m just glad you called .
ross , there &apos;s something that i &apos;ve got to tell you .
there &apos;s someone else .
does that mean the same thing in england as it does in america ?
she doesn &apos;t know who she wants . me or this &quot; colin &quot; guy .
so i told her when she figures it out , give me a call . maybe i &apos;ll still be around .
when you say &quot; still around , &quot; you mean still around like you might be in a relationship ...
or still around like you might have died waiting for the phone to ring ?
but it was so right.this isn &apos;t how it &apos;s supposed to go . there can &apos;t be another guy .
of course , there &apos;s another guy ! this is even more perfect .
you have to prove your love !
i &apos;m not proving anything . i &apos;m done listening to you .
if i hadn &apos;t let you talk me into this ... i wouldn &apos;t have put my fist through the wall .
you did that ? i missed and hit the door .
but it opened really hard .
you have to go to london .
you have to go fight for her.that makes sense .
you said you loved her , and she didn &apos;t say it back.then she told you about another guy .
go to london . scare her !
when rachel was with paolo , what did you do ?
i made fun of his accent .
you sat back and let him have her . you didn &apos;t fight .
i just told you , i made fun of him behind his back .
oh , i see .
you want that to happen with emily ?
no .
all right then , go fight for her !
it &apos;s like a snake pit .
that could be you and emily .
that but nicer .
go to london !
really ? surprise her . don &apos;t let her go without a fight .
all right . i &apos;m going to do it .
okay . good luck !
can you pick me up one of those toblerone bars at the airport ?
i did it ! i figured out a way to make money .
i &apos;ll open a massage place . frank will help me .
we &apos;ll work it around his schedule , so he doesn &apos;t have to quit school .
but how can you afford it ?
we were walking down the street , and we saw your van .
and we realized
i &apos;m telling it !
people need transportation , and they need massages to relax .
we can combine the two . i give massages and frank drives .
i &apos;ll bolt a table in the van , and you know what i &apos;ve got ?
a place that no one will get out of alive ?
think about it . it &apos;s a taxi that people take when they need to relax .
it &apos;s a relaxi @-@ taxi !
the name was my favorite part !
i came up with it .
you did not !
you came up with relaxi @-@ cab . that &apos;s not good .
oh , my god ! are you in england ? was emily surprised ?
no , she hasn &apos;t come home yet .
she hasn &apos;t been home all night . she must be with the other guy .
i &apos;m the stupid moron who spent the night here .
what was that ?
i just put my fist through another wall.tell the guys .
when is the next flight out ?
about four hours.stay there for a while . if she doesn &apos;t show up , come home .
there &apos;s a girl at the restaurant that would be perfect for you .
tell him about relaxi @-@ taxi .
ask him if he likes it better than relaxi @-@ cab .
it &apos;s not relaxi @-@ cab . it &apos;s relaxi @-@ cab . like taxi @-@ cab .
that is better .
do you have any 8 &apos;s ? no .
are we in london ?
why are you here ? you can &apos;t be here .
i &apos;ve come to talk to ross .
what ?
nothing .
i was going to call him ... you came to tell him you love him . i knew it !
i was right ! i &apos;m right , right ?
i &apos;d rather talk to him .
i &apos;ve been to his apartment and he &apos;s not there .
i need to talk to him . do you know where he is ?
ross , are you there ?
ross , i don &apos;t know if you hear this , but i &apos;ll talk anyway .
i &apos;m in the states with your sister and friends .
it &apos;s all over with colin .
i came here to tell you that and to tell you
yes , joey , you can have all the chocolate you want .
i came here to tell you that i love you .
i love you too ! i &apos;ll call you right now from the phone booth .
you can &apos;t hear me .
i wish i knew if you &apos;d heard me .
i suppose i &apos;ve given my neighbors a good laugh .
mrs. newman , if you &apos;re listening , bugger off . none of your business .
there &apos;s not much chance you did hear that.there &apos;s the call waiting ...
... so i should go.oh , well .
ross , i love you .
thank you .
i was just at the bank . there was this really hot teller ...
... and she didn &apos;t ask me to do it with her in the vault .
same thing happened to me .
pizza delivery girl comes over , gives me the pizza and leaves !
no &quot; nice apartment , bet the bedrooms are huge &quot; ?
nothing !
you know what ? we have to turn off the porn.i think you &apos;re right .
ready ? one , two , three .
that &apos;s kind of nice .
that &apos;s kind of a relief .
you want to see if we still have it ?
free porn !
we have free porn !
there &apos;s one , two and three .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s so beautiful .
oh , man .
i can &apos;t believe it.i know .
i like the middle one the best .
don &apos;t worry , i won &apos;t let the other two know .
