neal .
ellen .
you and your father .
my mom told me he was dead .
but you told me the truth .
he was a dirty cop ... and he &apos;s not dead .
ms. parker , you were neal &apos;s father &apos;s partner .
that &apos;s it , isn &apos;t it ?
agent burke , i &apos;m in witsec for a good reason .
these marshals are here to take neal caffrey into custody
he &apos;ll work for me in d.c. permanently .
you broke the rules .
i go back to work ,
and you &apos;re placed under review and reassigned ?
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s only temporary .
it &apos;s the evidence warehouse , and it &apos;s the best i could do .
the marshals are shipping me off in a few weeks .
everything i grew up believing was wrong ,
and i ran before i got to hear the full story .
i want to know who he was .
when my dad went away , ellen looked after me .
you grew up in witness protection .
i was 3 when the marshals took us away .
what happened ?
we found a gun with his prints on it .
he killed a cop ?
it was a long time ago .
i need to know who i am .
agent patterson .
watching you , caffrey .
always good to see you , sir .
patterson &apos;s not the only one keeping an eye on me .
black @-@ market prosthetics off a raid on the docks .
counterfeit eyeballs -- very rat pack .
sammy davis jr. had a glass eye .
we got to get you back to white collar .
oh , tell me about it . what &apos;s in the bag ?
oh , i made a detour on my way to the bank
to pick you up manhattan &apos;s best sandwich .
why did you go to the bank ?
you don &apos;t want to know where i got the sandwich ?
marginally less interesting .
first fbi check since i got back .
put it in my rainy @-@ day account .
rainy @-@ day account ?
well , with what i get paid , all i can afford is an umbrella .
cute .
good morning .
what can i do for you ?
how did you leave things with sara ?
non sequitur . why ?
look behind you .
i &apos;m an insurance investigator with sterling @-@ bosch .
i &apos;m here to see agent burke .
sara .
neal . how was your island adventure ?
you know , it was kind of like rum punch .
seemed like a good idea at the time un--
until the hangover ?
yeah .
yeah . hi , peter .
sara . what brings you down here ?
i &apos;m working the covington settlement .
grant covington-- hedge funder we targeted
during the sweep on insider trading last year .
we were getting close until he died .
scuba diving in the hamptons .
forfeiture units seized all illegal gains ,
and we closed the case .
well , i &apos;m cleaning it up on our end .
his death was ruled accidental , so ...
the young widow gets the insurance money .
how much ?
$ 50 million .
unless i can prove she doesn &apos;t deserve it .
now , the nypd ruled her out as a suspect , but--
you think sophie covington pulled one over on everyone ?
well , you &apos;re the connoisseur on crimes of persuasion .
that &apos;s what i want you to tell me .
and you &apos;re the expert on the case .
now , there &apos;s a memorial at 1 : 00
marking the anniversary of covington &apos;s death .
who &apos;s up for a stakeout ?
neal has errands to run ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t pick my brain
over manhattan &apos;s best sandwich .
then i &apos;ll take over .
fill in .
fill in .
thank you .
60 minutes , burke .
great .
well , the paparazzi are still interested .
a 21 @-@ gun salute-- that &apos;s what his will said .
nice to see a year after his death ,
covington &apos;s ego lives on .
that is a good sandwich .
now that the death certificate &apos;s been issued ,
sophie &apos;s giving covington his elaborate sendoff .
maybe for the second time .
think she made sure that dive was his last ?
well , she certainly had a lot to gain from his death .
that &apos;s wilson mailer , covington &apos;s hedge @-@ fund partner .
suspected he was dirty , too , but nothing stuck .
ohh , she didn &apos;t like that .
that &apos;s a familiar touch for a married man .
covington &apos;s rocky marriage was all over the gossip rags
when we were investigating them .
el leaves them in the bathroom .
well , perhaps that &apos;s why sophie &apos;s so reclusive .
this is the first time i &apos;ve had eyes on her
outside of a boardroom .
he &apos;s keeping his distance .
yeah .
he &apos;s too far away to be a curious bystander
and too subtle to be paparazzi .
neal , you &apos;ve hardly said a word .
are you sure you &apos;re up for this ?
ellen agreed to help me look into my father
before she disappears into witsec again .
it &apos;s now or never . there she is .
hello .
how are you ?
good .
good .
after all this time ,
i thought you two should know each other .
you must be mozzie .
charmed .
is it safe for you out here ?
oh , as far as anyone &apos;s concerned , i &apos;m , uh , long gone .
wild guess-- both of them are named marshal .
before i leave town ,
i think it &apos;s time you met my old friend sam .
i contacted him after we talked last .
sam ? did he know my father ?
he did . he &apos;s a cop -- undercover for a long time .
a hard guy to get hold of .
what was going on in my department was bigger than your dad .
sam was helping me get evidence on ... the others .
others ?
when your dad confessed , you , your mom , and i
were thrown into witsec ,
and there was no time to look for answers .
work with sam . maybe you &apos;ll find what i wanted to ,
that he wasn &apos;t a bad guy .
i just want to know the truth .
you want to help me finish planting ?
i would love to , but i got to get back to work .
i , on the other hand , am known for my work with yamadori bonsai .
that &apos;s true .
oh , forget @-@ me @-@ nots-- a fitting au revoir .
look after her , okay ?
i will .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
you &apos;re a dear .
thank you again .
let me get you some gloves .
oh , sure .
our delicate hands are roughly the same size .
we &apos;re at the southeast corner by the monument .
neal ?
yep .
he scorched a lot of earth when he left for his island adventure .
a little smoke damage here , but i wasn &apos;t totally unprepared .
you knew he was gonna run ?
something i &apos;ve learned--
things get stolen , and people go away .
most of the time , you don &apos;t get them back .
detail , attention !
pull and hold .
wonder if he got a permit for that .
make ready ! aim !
sophie &apos;s leaving before it &apos;s over .
fire !
not quite the grieving widow .
make ready !
aim ! fire !
make ready !
aim !
fire !
make ready !
aim ! fire !
fire !
fire !
fire !
i think you just saved my life .
you could be right . you okay ?
sophie , over here !
wait up , sophie !
i have to go . i have to go .
hey ! wait a second !
this way , ma &apos;am . come on .
sophie , excuse me !
stay back !
hey , you all right ? what happened ?
somebody tried to grab sophie .
looks like your insurance @-@ fraud case
just turned attempted kidnapping .
well , you can add theft to that list .
she stole my hat .
something didn &apos;t seem alright
so we get out of the car .
i saw neal start to run , got there as fast as i could ,
but the guy was gone .
it was a faded blue , grayish van ,
no plates .
that &apos;s all i saw .
reporters captured a few photos of caffrey &apos;s hat ,
but nothing we can use .
it all happened too fast . thanks , peter .
yep .
you &apos;ll be back .
shouting down at us like alexander the great .
i see myself more as a caesar .
you say roman . i say greek .
burke , what are you doing here ?
just gave diana my statement .
the covington widow .
kidnappings are usually personal .
okay , all right .
we should send somebody ...
caffrey , give us a minute , please .
... out there who knows every--
peter , justice is still reviewing your case .
covington is an active investigation .
you need to back off .
i was lead on that investigation for a year .
i know .
i could consult outside my hours at the evidence warehouse .
no investigating , no field work .
tap me like a geyser .
i &apos;ll make a call as long as you keep it to that .
you said you were gonna make a call .
you want me to do it right now ?
i &apos;d appreciate that .
why were you leaving the memorial ?
i was overwhelmed .
my driver had the car waiting around the corner .
who runs after nearly being kidnapped ?
someone who feels like they &apos;re being chased .
figures you &apos;d side with the fleeing suspect .
you know , the thing about fleeing suspects is ,
they can &apos;t say goodbye ... to anyone .
well , that &apos;s on the &quot; lam 101 . &quot;
you know why i had to run .
i do .
and just so you know ,
the world did not stop spinning without you .
miss covington , i know it &apos;s been a rough day ,
but we do want to help you .
do you ?
when the fbi investigated my husband ,
my life was turned inside out .
after he died , that wretched insurance investigator
all but accused me of murder .
think she &apos;s talking about you ?
i &apos;ve heard worse .
we &apos;re all just trying to do our jobs here .
you &apos;ll have to excuse me ,
but i &apos;ve had my fill of law @-@ enforcement types .
hey , don &apos;t you need to get back to evidence ?
convinced the brass to let me consult on all things covington .
they made you a consultant ?
do you have a radius ?
i have a badge .
one last question --
what is the nature of your relationship with will mailer ?
you do not get to ask me about my personal life .
ooh , touchy subject . can i see that ?
any more questions , you can contact my lawyer .
and call off your tail . i &apos;m sick of being followed .
we don &apos;t have surveillance on her .
neither does sterling @-@ bosch .
that guy we saw lurking around the memorial --
he &apos;s got to be involved .
sophie &apos;s done with the fbi .
oh , but i bet she would talk with
the dashing stranger that saved her life .
i could find out what &apos;s really going on
between her and mailer .
if someone is tailing her , we can get a look .
what are you thinking ?
come with me .
okay .
all right , you sure she won &apos;t recognize you
from your investigation into her husband ?
we never met in person .
all right , set me up .
i hope this wasn &apos;t too disruptive .
oh , it &apos;s not a problem . i &apos;m just happy i could help out .
it &apos;s you .
you okay ?
i was just giving my statement to agent burke here .
yes , thank you for your time ,
mr ... armstrong .
uh , neal .
well , at least now i know your name .
yeah . neal armstrong .
like the astronaut .
one small step for man .
sophie covington .
nice to meet you .
i don &apos;t know how to thank you for what you did .
if there &apos;s ever anything that i can do ,
just please let me know .
actually , there is .
can i get my hat back ?
i don &apos;t have it here .
we could meet for coffee or ...
this is my address . come by around 4 : 00 .
and i &apos;ll have it waiting for you .
all right .
if i can help you in any way , please give me a call .
he &apos;s one of the good guys .
are you --
one more thing to discuss with agent burke .
see you at 4 : 00 .
bye .
neal armstrong ?
well , uh , arms , arms --
all those prosthetics in the evidence warehouse .
a @-@ at least it &apos;s better than neal handleman .
no , it &apos;s not . i like neal handleman .
i should have gone with eyes @-@ enhauer .
that would have been good .
this is mr. mailer .
just here to pick up my hat .
the knight in shining armor .
more of a right place , right time kind of thing .
mr. armstrong , it &apos;s good to see you .
call me neal , please .
neal , it &apos;s good to see you .
goodbye , will .
hope i &apos;m not interrupting .
i didn &apos;t realize you &apos;d have a friend over .
will &apos;s not a friend .
he was my husband &apos;s business partner .
so , tell me , neal ,
are you a professional kidnapping interventionist or ...
no , i &apos;m an entrepreneur .
i &apos;ve done well over the years ,
and i enjoy finding worthy causes to give back to .
i used to teach public school . i -- after i met grant ,
i started a charity for art programs .
the more i made , the more i gave away ,
which was just something else for us to fight about .
you have a beautiful home .
thank you . i spend a lot of time here .
the media attention , it &apos;s just --
why you took my hat .
yes , that &apos;s why i took your hat .
vintage .
i almost hate to give it back .
oh , nice .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
speaking of vintage , um ...
would you like a glass of wine or ...
i &apos;d love one .
okay .
i backpacked the costa brava after college .
this rioja reminds me of it .
to spanish wine .
to hats .
so , how does this count as consulting ?
confirming i.d.
that &apos;s the same guy i saw at the memorial .
you know , i feel like i &apos;m being followed .
yeah , we &apos;re tailing your tail .
lose him so we can follow him home .
you &apos;re asking me to give up trade secrets ?
call your patent lawyer .
just a minute .
one second .
gun ! fbi ! fbi !
don &apos;t hurt me !
calm down , or you &apos;re gonna hurt yourself !
okay , okay .
freddy slavkin .
what were you doing at the covington memorial today ?
someone hire you to grab sophie ?
didn &apos;t get the job done ,
so you thought they were coming after you ?
what ? no . no , no , no .
so you usually answer the door like that ?
i thought i was dealing with disgruntled husbands .
you don &apos;t strike me as the romantic type . explain .
i &apos;m a p.i. i work infidelity cases .
a lot of what i find tends to make people want to kill me .
who hired you to tail sophie ?
you pulled a weapon on a federal agent .
you are way past client confidentiality .
woman named poppy mailer .
mailer &apos;s wife .
she hired you to find out
if he &apos;s having an affair with sophie covington .
is he ?
uh , spent six months trying to confirm ,
but so far zip .
mrs. mailer &apos;s obsessed .
she wants to know everything about sophie .
who comes , who goes -- she wants it all .
you take any photos today ?
th @-@ they &apos;re in the printer .
i haven &apos;t gone through them yet .
old @-@ school .
you got a shot of the kidnapper .
good thing we &apos;re collecting evidence today .
i need everything you have on sophie covington .
o @-@ over there .
all that and no proof of an affair ,
and she still keeps you on retainer .
me and her psychic .
sophie covington -- what is she like ?
from what i saw ,
she &apos;s not into murder , money , or mailer .
so she &apos;s not the gold @-@ digging ,
social @-@ climbing husband murderer that i read about ?
no . i think she &apos;s lonely .
well , she &apos;s not a shopper , but mailer is .
handbags , jewelry , flowers .
big spender for a guy who &apos;s low on money .
mailer &apos;s cellphone --
he calls sophie , but she doesn &apos;t call back .
all right , these are sophie &apos;s movements at the memorial .
sophie gets there . mailer &apos;s waiting .
he touches her . she pulls away . she leaves .
i don &apos;t see mailer anywhere over here .
he &apos;s in the earlier shots but not the later ones .
because he &apos;s our kidnapper .
from freddy &apos;s file ,
same red stripe on the glove .
all right , not definitive ,
but what if mailer and covington
ran their insider @-@ trading scheme together ?
fbi &apos;s closing in ,
so mailer pins it all on covington .
sabotaged his diving equipment and kills him .
but he realizes sophie &apos;s gonna get the insurance payout ,
so he seduces her .
she &apos;s not having it .
he decides to grab her at the memorial . why ?
he could force her to
transfer the money to an offshore account .
pay her own ransom .
it &apos;s basically a white @-@ collar mugging .
sophie wouldn &apos;t have gotten out of that van alive .
mailer was at her place today .
if we &apos;re right , he &apos;s gonna try again .
sophie likes you .
if mailer thinks someone else is going to steal that fortune
before he does--
no , no , no .
i &apos;m not that guy . i can &apos;t con a widow .
you can if it &apos;s to save her .
we force mailer to act , and we nail him .
well , how do we convince him that we &apos;re an item ?
freddy .
good .
freddy takes incriminating photos of you and sophie .
mrs. mailer will not be able to resist using those
to turn the screws on her husband .
come on . it &apos;s what we pay you the rainy @-@ day bucks for .
come on , information .
i told you , he &apos;s unique .
so is bob saget . that tells me nothing .
mozzie invited me over to play cards .
that explains the marshals trying to blend in out front .
ellen has so little time left in the city ,
i thought she should spend it with friends .
that &apos;s awfully charitable of you for a weekday .
well , i do have ulterior motives .
i want to know more about you as a child .
i &apos;m not talking .
come on , give me something .
he forged his school i.d.
he , uh , conned the bullies out of their milk money .
wore ties to preschool .
no ties , but there was always a little con man in him .
i knew that .
talent like his is born . it &apos;s not made .
come on , a &quot; for instance . &quot;
okay , neal loved school ,
but his mother wasn &apos;t , uh --
punctual . she was a mess .
she never got me to school on time .
so , first , he broke in and adjusted the school clock
so that class started 30 minutes later .
mind you , this was when he was in second grade .
okay , that could not have worked .
no , it didn &apos;t . so then he tried barricading the roads
and rerouting the school bus to run past his house .
that actually worked for a few days .
then he got smart
and started forging his own city bus passes .
i was never late again .
ooh , speaking of ,
i can &apos;t keep my shining knights waiting .
i should go .
great to see you .
i &apos;ll let you know when i hear from sam , hmm ?
okay .
bye @-@ bye , ellen .
bye , mozzie . thanks for letting me win .
see you soon .
thanks , moz .
ah , she &apos;s a nice lady .
she &apos;s really gonna miss new york .
we all do . it &apos;s a hard city to leave .
now , you came in with a suit @-@ induced frown .
can i help ?
peter wants me to con a widow .
well , widows fall into two categories --
the bereaved and the relieved .
which kind does he have you duping ?
the kind with the $ 50 @-@ million bull &apos;s @-@ eye on her back .
sophie covington ?
is she the killer ?
no , she &apos;s not .
and i need to convince a p.i.
that she and i are romantically involved .
well , that shouldn &apos;t be too hard , cheekbones .
don &apos;t ever call me that again .
i want you to tell the p.i. who i am ,
who i &apos;ve always been .
a con man ?
exactly .
while you do what ?
mr. armstrong .
tony .
neal .
hey . what are you doing here ?
oh , all that talk of spain last night
reminded me of cadaqués --
rocky beaches , artists &apos; colonies ,
best seafood i ever had .
that is a paella pan .
how would you like to go to the costa brava
without leaving the house ?
fellow ornithologist .
what kind of bird you watching ?
the kind that steals nest eggs and flies south real fast .
man &apos;s got something on his mind besides the hat .
&quot; maltese falcon &quot;
all true .
so , what were you doing in cadaqués ?
just passing through on my way from france .
found the dali museum very challenging .
all right . hope you &apos;re hungry .
best halal cart in the city .
want ?
i &apos;ll take your word for it .
you know , your guy just started coming around .
oh , probably smells the greenbacks .
you may have heard of him --
nick halden , george devore ...
neal armstrong .
con man .
oh , world class .
this is really nice .
it &apos;s one of my favorites .
no , i mean this -- staying in , making lunch .
never did that when i was married .
your husband wasn &apos;t into cooking ?
turns out we actually didn &apos;t have that much in common .
i admit i jumped in without looking ,
but you make a choice and --
and suddenly , you &apos;re living a life
you never thought you &apos;d have .
been there -- a couple times .
this the gala for your charity ?
yeah .
i was gonna go , donate the insurance settlement .
all of it ?
i don &apos;t feel right having it ,
but i &apos;m not ready to go back out there ,
so i &apos;ll just send a check .
you know , not long ago , i took off for a while .
thought a break from new york was what i needed .
and then a friend helped me find a way to get my life back .
wasn &apos;t easy , but ... it was worth it .
i should go .
can you walk me out ?
sure .
guess this is goodbye ?
guess it is .
okay .
bye , sophie .
bye .
forget something ?
oh , it looks better on you ,
but i should probably hang on to it .
yeah .
all right .
all right .
must have been a hell of a paella .
yeah , i went for the hug . sophie upped it to a kiss .
yeah , and you couldn &apos;t deny the kiss
&apos;cause you were working .
whatever it takes to get the job done .
good hustle .
thank you .
where &apos;d you get these ?
envelope on my doorstep ,
along with an invoice for five hours of p.i. work
to be paid in cash .
honest day &apos;s work for moz .
yeah , for a change .
did you set up an auto alert on mailer &apos;s bank account ?
poppy withdraws anything more than 100 bucks ,
will mailer gets a text message .
and ?
worked like a charm .
we set up surveillance in freddy &apos;s building .
she took out money . he got curious and followed her .
this gets good .
poppy , what the hell is going on ?
you followed me ? !
you are going through money like water !
why don &apos;t you take a look at this , will ?
your whore has found herself another man .
you put a p.i. on sophie ?
how long has this been going on ?
long enough to know what a bastard i married .
you know what the best part is ?
hat man is after her money .
looks like moz earned his pay .
when he gets me his social @-@ security number .
hello ?
sophie , hi .
i think we &apos;ve found our widow of opportunity .
get it ? dropped the &quot; n. &quot;
mm , that ...
sophie invited caffrey to escort her to the gala .
it &apos;s already hit the websites . mailer will know .
if mailer &apos;s plan is to grab sophie ,
this is his chance .
we &apos;ll have agents at all points of entry --
perimeter surrounding the building , outside her house .
if mailer makes a move , we &apos;re ready .
we &apos;ll track you in the limo via cell signal .
all right , gear up . head out .
jones , take off caffrey &apos;s anklet .
where &apos;s peter ?
evidence . nothing left to consult on .
he should be here . - don &apos;t worry , caffrey --
i &apos;ll be there to keep an eye on you .
ever tell you how much i hate that van ?
everyone in position .
eyes on mailer . call it in .
that man is not happy .
well , the van will do that to you .
caffrey better be on his best behavior .
caffrey &apos;s on route .
sorry i kept you waiting .
don &apos;t worry about it . you look beautiful .
tony , how are we doing for time ?
oh , we should be all right , miss covington .
what &apos;s wrong ? you seem distracted .
i &apos;m admiring tony &apos;s watch .
that the new fathom 20 ?
it is .
pricy .
was it worth it ?
i think so .
you think i &apos;d look good with a watch like tony &apos;s ?
i &apos;m not sure it would suit you ?
but you don &apos;t really know me , do you ?
why do you think we met ?
i don &apos;t know -- happy coincidence .
or rescuing you turned out to be the perfect way in .
in ? what are you talking about ?
when i was at your place ,
you told me you felt bad about having all that money .
i wanted to help . so i took it off your hands .
you took it ?
your banking information wasn &apos;t hard to find .
you stole $ 50 million from her ?
yeah , there it goes .
just put $ 50 million into my rainy @-@ day account .
you were gonna give it away .
tony , call the police .
tony doesn &apos;t work for you anymore .
that watch means tony can be bought .
he knows how to follow the money .
maybe he wants to come work for me .
she &apos;s got a party to get to .
let her out .
by the time you call that fbi agent burke ,
we &apos;ll be long gone .
no one &apos;s making any calls .
i &apos;m sorry , miss covington .
give me your phone and get out -- now .
what are you ... ?
you make me sick !
was any of it real ?
go .
i need your phone , too .
you have the money ?
i said i did .
that was a bad idea .
we &apos;ll see about that .
stop staring at me .
help me get through this , we can go home to the wives .
scale of worst evidence you &apos;ve handled ,
how bad is this ?
oh , it &apos;s nothing .
the snakes -- that was bad .
i hate snakes .
peter burke .
agent burke , this is sophie covington .
sophie , you all right ?
you said to call you if i needed help .
i need help .
the man that saved my life --
neal ?
he stole my money .
is that a personal call ?
where is he now ?
he &apos;s with tony , my driver .
they -- they forced me out of my car ,
and he took my phone .
all right , sophie , this is very important .
what exactly did neal say to you ?
he said he put my husband &apos;s life @-@ insurance money
into his rainy @-@ day account .
he said that -- rainy @-@ day account ?
he said that by the time i called you ,
he &apos;d be long gone .
he mentioned me by name ?
that &apos;s how i remembered you &apos;d given me your card .
he said he took $ 50 million ,
but i don &apos;t have that much money .
sophie , you &apos;re gonna be okay .
stay where you are .
where are you going ?
burke , where are you going ?
one step out that door , i write you up .
it goes on your record .
burke , where are you going ?
to cross the line .
saw a picture of you with sophie covington .
you move fast .
why not ? she &apos;s a nice girl .
with a lot of money . you screwed me .
twice .
but today , you forgot your lucky hat .
you don &apos;t need luck when you got a plan .
time to tell me who the hell you really are .
my name &apos;s neal caffrey .
i &apos;m the best thing that ever happened to you .
caffrey &apos;s signal &apos;s still not up .
pull traffic cams for all routes
from the covington residence .
right away , sir .
hey , peter ! what are you doing ?
you weren &apos;t authorized to ...
neal is in trouble .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
are you tracking his phone ?
well , the signal dropped . we &apos;re working on it .
this op &apos;s gone off the rails . mailer &apos;s not coming .
he paid off sophie &apos;s driver .
she and caffrey both got grabbed ?
yeah , but neal managed to get her out of the car .
sophie called me . she &apos;s safe ,
but he &apos;s on his own .
any idea where he is ?
no , but i think i know how to get him out of there .
this way .
i thought it &apos;d be best if you filled her in .
all yours .
sophie ...
neal works for the fbi .
we sent him undercover to protect you .
he said that he siphoned the life @-@ insurance money from you ,
but he didn &apos;t .
then why would he say that ?
to get you out of the car .
he figured out tony had been paid off to abduct you .
paid off by who ?
wilson mailer tried to kidnap you .
he &apos;s after the insurance payout .
oh , my god .
i got here as fast as i could .
how do we get caffrey out of there ?
he passed me a message through sophie .
we need to put the entire insurance settlement
in neal &apos;s bank account .
$ 25 million from each of you .
sure you got that message right ?
yeah . i know neal .
sara , i &apos;m sure you can get authorization for that .
you want 15 % ?
it &apos;s a good deal .
for you .
better deal for me is kill you and keep all of it . 
i can &apos;t transfer the money if i &apos;m dead .
you kill me , you &apos;ve got a body to get rid of .
i &apos;ve been seen with sophie .
she thinks i stole the money .
i &apos;m your face man .
you believe in luck , you can push yours ,
or you pay me enough money to disappear ,
and it &apos;s a win @-@ win .
what keeps you from turning me in ?
may i ?
think a guy with a wanted poster is gonna go to the law ?
so , your plan is to put $ 50 million
into the personal bank account of a con man
who recently fled to a remote island
with no extradition ?
so that he can transfer it to a financial genius
who will have made every effort
to make sure that we can &apos;t trace it .
yep .
it &apos;s your money , ladies .
he saved my life . i &apos;m in .
he must have a plan . 
10 % , and you have a deal . 
i can work with that .
do the transfer .
sara , in or out ? 
okay .
i &apos;m in , too .
okay .
all right , tony &apos;s paid off ,
i &apos;m not saying anything , 
and you &apos;re a much richer man than i am . 
it &apos;s a pleasure doing business with someone
who sets the bar so high .
means something coming from you .
i got to ask-- grant covington--
how did you pull that off ? 
oxygen tank ? 
switched out the regulator valve .
just like that , nothing left behind .
if it weren &apos;t for that p.i. and his photos ,
i wouldn &apos;t have to run .
you &apos;ve seen them , right ?
there are none of you ?
nothing left behind . 
guess you really are a lucky man .
think i could get my phone back ? 
we should have heard from him by now .
yeah . 
neal ?
well , the good news is , i &apos;m alive .
that is good news .
wait , is there bad news ?
depends on whether you &apos;re a &quot; glass half full &quot;
or a &quot; glass half empty &quot; kind of person .
you lost half the money ?
or a glass 10 % full .
mailer has 90 % ? !
sometimes in life , you have to cut a deal .
any other good news ?
yeah .
mailer &apos;s headed to freddy &apos;s to destroy the evidence .
we don &apos;t have much time .
i send you , it &apos;s both our asses on the line .
yeah .
neal , i &apos;m on my way .
fbi !
show me your hands . drop the weapon .
nice gloves . they look familiar .
it &apos;s kind of warm out there for those , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , it &apos;s a beautiful day .
turn around .
wilson mailer , you &apos;re under arrest .
good thing we were behind that door .
guy who lives here would have shot you .
sophie , the things i said in the limo--
you don &apos;t need to apologize .
listen , you asked me if any of it was real .
a lot of it was .
you saved my life .
and made you some paella .
and you saved my life again .
thank you ... neal armstrong .
neal armstrong-- definitely not real .
yeah , kind of figured .
sure made for a great story , though .
we made the window
for forensics to track the bank transfer .
money &apos;s been recovered ,
and it looks like they can prove
mailer tampered with covington &apos;s regulator .
we can also get him on murder .
handed you an inch , you sprinted to the finish line .
caffrey did the same thing .
the two of you ...
careful , peter .
i don &apos;t want you to wake up one day
and not recognize yourself .
they made a decision ?
&quot; it is our recommendation that he be reinstated
as special agent in charge
of the manhattan white collar division . &quot;
&quot; effective immediately . &quot;
congratulations , honey .
thanks .
congrats , peter .
it &apos;ll be good to have you back in the office .
and we &apos;re not just saying that
because we get to hand caffrey back to you .
well , i wouldn &apos;t be here if it weren &apos;t for all of you .
you make me look good .
to peter burke .
the man we all wish we could be more like .
cheers ! cheers ! cheers ! cheers !
let me get over here .
shake my boss &apos;s hand . yeah .
team &apos;s back together the way it should be .
refill ?
yes , lots to celebrate .
peter &apos;s back .
sophie &apos;s safe . 
and you &apos;re mad at me . 
come on . truth .
oh , neal , i was .
you had a right .
after everything you did for me , i--
neal , it &apos;s not about you .
that &apos;s very mature .
i told you about emily . 
your sister .
one day , i &apos;m yelling at her for borrowing my clothes ,
and the next--
she ran away . 
you leaving like that-- it opened up some old wounds .
you know , she &apos;s out there somewhere .
i just wish i knew where . 
you deserve to know .
don &apos;t we all ?
ellen !
no ! i &apos;m family ! i &apos;m family !
i &apos;m family !
they found me .
who ? who did this to you ?
trust sam .
all right , she &apos;s in respiratory arrest ! we got to go !
i want to come with you .
