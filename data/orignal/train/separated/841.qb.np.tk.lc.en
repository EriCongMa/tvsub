ugh ! son of a bitch .
nothing .
i &apos;m trying to get touch with sam ...
you know , to clear the air ...
get out of my life .
why isn &apos;t he responding ?
i &apos;m just gonna go out on a crazy limb here--
maybe it &apos;s because you got his girlfriend to dump him ?
i &apos;m not being weird about it .
i just texted him three times .
and i called him .
he wasn &apos;t there .
i left him a sensible voice mail .
to lighten the mood ,
i told a little story
about how the first @-@ graders &apos; pet rabbit
got stuck in the lawn mower
and i had to ...
i had to collect it .
that &apos;s a terrible story .
colonel flapears ?
wow . unbelievable .
i had to park two blocks away ,
like an animal .
the new bar , presh , is doing valet
and they took all of our spots .
i &apos;ve been saying for months that we need valet .
is there anything sexier than tossing your keys
in the general direction of someone you care nothing about ?
&quot; keep it running . &quot;
hi . i &apos;m looking for jessica day .
oh , right here .
you &apos;ve just been served .
what ? !
what ?
a restraining order ? !
from sam .
i &apos;m not a restraining order person .
a restraining order . that &apos;s worse than herpes .
when i find sam ...
i &apos;m gonna kill him .
you can &apos;t find sam .
&apos;cause you have a restraining order .
winston . you have to help me with this .
sam is the only one who can drop this charge .
but the magic of a restraining order
is that you can &apos;t talk to him .
and that ...
that is human drama .
第五季 第十四集
tasteful , hip ...
i mean , nothing matches , yet nothing is random .
that &apos;s just a framed toupee on the wall
and it friggin &apos; works .
what are these bartenders wearing ?
they look like civil war surgeons .
this is a very professional establishment .
let me do the talking .
you don &apos;t think i talk professional good ?
you don &apos;t think i professional talk good ?
what am i saying weird there ?
you speak poorly , professionally .
okay .
hey , hey . i &apos;m connie , the owner .
you &apos;re the nutmeg wholesaler ?
me ? no , i &apos;m not the nutmeg wholesaler .
you have a nutmeg wholesaler vibe .
that &apos;s what it is .
i &apos;ve been trying to figure it out for years .
you totally look like a nutmeg wholesaler .
me no nutmeg ...
how can i help you ?
connie , hello .
very nice to meet you .
we are both local entrepreneurs ,
as you are .
uh , we co @-@ own the bar up the street ,
and there is a business situation that we would like
to bring to your attention ...
yeah , your stupid valet
is taking all the spots in front of our bar ,
and it &apos;s time for it to come to an end .
it &apos;s not sittin &apos; well
with us folks over at the griffin .
what &apos;s a griffin ?
what is ...
wait , what is the griffin ?
the griffin is the name of the bar
that we own together , you buffoon .
you don &apos;t know the name of our bar ?
why don &apos;t we ...
we don &apos;t have a sign . we should have a sign .
is this the time for this ?
i feel like this is a conversation
i don &apos;t need to be a part of .
my valet is totally legal .
but thanks for stopping by .
maybe , you know , maybe i &apos;ll stop by your bar .
i &apos;ll just , like , knock on doors until ...
until i find you .
uh , please don &apos;t leave . pl ...
okay , leave . we &apos;ll d @-@ discuss this ...
i don &apos;t like this woman .
hey , uh , where should i put this , uh , nutmeg ?
the lady &apos;s name is connie .
she &apos;s o @-@ over that way .
i &apos;m here to overturn a restraining order .
i brought lots of excellent character references .
in the words of ms. cheryl riggins of portland , oregon :
&quot; when the school sewage line broke ,
&quot; jessica was the only student who rolled up her sleeves ,
&quot; grabbed a pail and went to work .
&quot; she should be tested for hepatitis immediately .
immediately . &quot;
that &apos;s not the one ...
uh , sorry about that , riggs .
uh , jessica , you better be here
because you wrote a song you wanted me to listen to .
i just don &apos;t get why sam would do this .
i &apos;m not dangerous .
friend face . that was cute .
cop face . girl , sit yo &apos; ass down .
and use the word
&quot; allegedly &quot; when discussing sam .
i do not need internal affairs crawling all up in my holes .
what if i typed up a note and left it on his car ?
oh , you stop it , jess .
yeah , but i ...
let it lie .
okay .
no letters .
this would &apos;ve been a better plan
if i knew what he drives .
a lot of black cars .
cars should have people &apos;s names on them .
ugh , it &apos;s so stupid .
well , have a good one .
see you later .
see you tomorrow .
no . no .
sam drives a truck ?
oh , geez , oh , geez , oh , geez , oh , geez .
well , this is not my fault .
hey , jess , i &apos;m at work .
is this the cop situation or a friend situation ?
both . what would you say
if i told you i was in the bed of sam &apos;s pickup ?
allegedly .
i said &quot; allegedly . &quot;
okay , good . so you &apos;re not in the back of a truck .
no , i am .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m , i am &quot; allegedly &quot;
in @-@ in sam &apos;s truck .
jess , you seem to be confused . here &apos;s how it works .
um , allegedly , ferguson and i
are eating pasta in a hot air balloon . realistically ...
winston , i &apos;m in the back of sam &apos;s truck right now .
i wanted sam to know
that i &apos;m not crazy .
wait , shh , he &apos;s changing his music .
selena gomez , interesting .
jess , what is happening right now ?
connie , with her fancy cocktails .
i can make a fancy cocktail .
sure you can .
hey , hey , hey , what &apos;s going on here ?
what the hell is all this stuff ?
we need to make some ...
some real improvements around here ,
if we &apos;re gonna compete with presh .
improvements ? !
just minor tweaks , okay ?
like a jukebox that doesn &apos;t catch fire sometimes .
separate olive and cherry trays .
a toilet that flushes down and not up .
okay , that &apos;s an attraction
and a lot of our customers actually like that .
why are you so eager to change our bar ?
we should be ruining their bar .
we should cut their power .
we should paint a door where there isn &apos;t a door .
we &apos;re not talented enough to paint a realistic door , nick .
all right , okay . try this .
i call it &quot; whiskey business , &quot;
but surprise !
there &apos;s vodka in that .
boom .
thank you , honey .
come on .
it &apos;s a little chunky .
tastes like loose chili , a little bit .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna go get some fresher ingredients .
okay , you do that , hon .
can we please stop competing
with these fad bars ?
i hate fads , man .
nick , just a small little piece
of important , friendly advice :
you need to give your ds more emphasis .
fads .
what i said .
you &apos;re gonna get yourself in trouble .
by hating fads ?
that &apos;s ... maybe just change it to &quot; trendy &quot; bars .
or &quot; hip &quot; bars .
we need to stop competing
with trendy , hip fad bars ?
all right . i need a drink .
oh , you gotta be kidding me .
somebody cut our soda .
oh , my god , who would do such a thing ?
it &apos;s connie , schmidt .
well , how would she have gotten in here ?
i mean , she couldn &apos;t ...
she took our bubbles , schmidt !
we have to retaliate .
what do we look like , tonya harding &apos;s henchmen ?
who am i , jeff gillooly ?
either you care enough about this bar to fight for it ,
or you don &apos;t .
because i care enough . i &apos;ll fight .
let &apos;s do this . what are we gonna do ?
we &apos;re gonna hit her where it hurts .
i &apos;m in .
not the vagina .
we &apos;re gonna go after the bar .
uh , yes , that &apos;s ri ... n ... there was not even a single part of me
that thought you were talking about the vagina .
the bar .
the b ...
yes , the ...
all right , i &apos;m gonna take over the plan .
good . yeah , good .
it was getting on top of me .
winston , sorry .
sorry , i hit some potholes , and then we got on the freeway ,
and then some schoolkids started throwing pencils at me ,
then we passed a cop , and i had to pretend to be a mannequin .
what is that noise ?
hang on a second , winston .
oh , no .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
where are you ? what is that ... ?
winston , can you hear me ?
jess , i can &apos;t hear you !
winston ? !
i can &apos;t ... are you okay ?
what is happening right now ?
the bed &apos;s getting cold , and you &apos;re not here ...
hello , jess ?
the future that we hold is so unclear ...
... can hear me , listen to me now ... - ow , ow , ow .
shining like stars and screaming ...
winston !
winston , help !
but then you disappear and make me wait ...
i need all units ! send all units !
baby , baby , no , i can &apos;t escape ...
so this is how i die !
the future that we hold is so unclear
but i &apos;m not alive
reasons why ...
i &apos;m not crazy !
that was great .
just like i visioned it .
connie cut our soda line .
so we take a fish ,
and we put it in the vents of her restaurant bar .
the whole place is gonna smell like a whale &apos;s ass .
not just any fish either .
a branzino . you know ...
freaking branzino .
she thinks she &apos;s hip and classy .
wait till she tangles with
the most highly regarded table fish in all the world .
i was trying to cut a runaway olive ,
and i cut the soda line .
why ? why &apos;d you ... ?
i @-@ i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d actually notice , to be honest with you .
what are we going to do now ?
deny , deny , deny .
there &apos;s no way she &apos;ll know it &apos;s us .
oh , hey , guys . i just came by to return your fish .
i &apos;ve never seen that fish before in my life .
ooh , is that a branzino ?
whoever bought that fish has impeccable taste .
i mean , i guess they kind of look like ...
nah , that doesn &apos;t even ... no , that &apos;s ...
really ?
yeah , good luck finding those guys .
of course it &apos;s us , you idiot .
why &apos;d you admit it ? !
we &apos;re right there ! we might as well be wearing name tags !
you &apos;re so stupid , man .
you &apos;re so stupid , moron .
you &apos;re a bad guy to partner up in this stuff .
give us a chance to , first , apologize
and , second , give you a little bit of context here .
you see , we thought that you attacked our bar .
why would i attack a bar that has no one in it ?
and if i did want to attack you , i would just report you
for one of your numerous health code violations .
some improvements definitely need to be made .
we ... we found a dead fox in the keg room the other week .
we &apos;re not sure it was a fox .
uh , it was an animal that had died in our keg room
that was bigger than a cat but smaller than a big dog ...
a word of advice : do not mess with me .
this past year has been the worst year of my life .
first , my cat died .
then my husband left me for our neighbor ,
and so i had to listen to them having sex
through our bedroom wall every single night .
and then he left my neighbor for my mother ,
which is , like , a very long story
that i don &apos;t really want to get into .
then my other cat died .
then i ran over a dog
while i was driving to the vet with our dead cat on my lap .
you guys messed with my business ...
now i &apos;m gonna have to destroy you .
if i may ... ask ...
how and when you &apos;re planning on destroying us .
any information would be ... would be greatly appreciated .
yeah , &apos; cause then we could prepare for it a little bit .
it &apos;s gonna be soon .
and when you least expect it .
that &apos;s something . thank ...
you followed me into a car wash !
that is so not ...
okay , i have a ...
what i want to say to you ...
i have a lot of things i want to say to you .
i have a restraining order against you .
i &apos;m not dangerous , and you don &apos;t need to be afraid of me .
clearly .
okay , well , i guess , um ... nice seeing you .
i &apos;m gonna get to my next engagement .
where are we , by the way ?
i &apos;ll just check my little ... my little thing .
it &apos;s actually not functioning .
old gal got a little bit wet .
eh , feed it to the birds .
that got me .
yeah , that got me .
oh , i &apos;m just gonna rest for a second .
get in the car .
damn it .
yeah , i get it .
it &apos;s too sad to watch .
clear .
clear .
there are no signs of foul play back here .
also , i feel fantastic .
that &apos;s because you &apos;re very drunk , cece .
you &apos;re supposed to be spitting them out .
how would she poison our booze anyway ?
we &apos;ve been here the entire time .
who knows ?
you saw how intense she was .
we &apos;re at a state of high alert .
and , frankly , i don &apos;t trust your coat .
it &apos;s too warm to wear a coat like that .
unless you &apos;re hiding a fish . you hiding a fish ?
all i got &apos;s a chicken .
okay , don &apos;t trust you .
out you go .
thanks for coming in again , eric .
this bar is outrageous .
i &apos;m so sorry it &apos;s not like your favorite bar , presh .
you know my favorite bar is heshe &apos;s tango in phuket .
their coconut mojitos literally gave me an orgasm .
i had to buy new pants .
&quot; i love presh .
presh has napkins and ... walnuts . &quot;
is that meant to be me ?
no , i &apos;m doing a spot @-@ on winston .
because i do not talk like that .
do you even like the griffin ?
what is the gri ... ?
are you kidding me ?
it &apos;s ... uh , the griffin &apos;s our bar .
i knew that .
he loves it !
what the hell are you talking about , you booze hound ?
we lost her a long time ago .
cece , honey , drink some water , okay ?
nope .
hey , man , do you know how hard i have worked
at this bar in the past year ?
i &apos;ve killed myself for this place .
a year ago , we were in a sinkhole .
we were in the red .
but now , because of me , because of my work ,
we &apos;re in the white .
what &apos;s &quot; the white &quot; ?
the white . breaking even .
oh , we &apos;re breaking even ?
yes , that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
how wonderful . and let &apos;s just stop there .
where will we invest our extra zero percent ?
i know , how about in the toilet ?
the same toilet that flushes upwards .
wait ! what if this ... this was connie &apos;s plan the entire time ?
okay , she knew we would be so paranoid
that we would drive all the customers out of the bar
and start fighting with each other .
connie emptied this entire bar without lifting a finger .
nick , you may not like her ,
but you must admit she is brilliant .
i don &apos;t have to admit that .
but i will say you &apos;ve made something crystal clear .
i &apos;m alone .
i &apos;m all alone .
oh , here we go .
so what i &apos;m gonna do is
i &apos;m gonna handle this myself , all alone .
i &apos;m gonna call a meeting of the families ...
oh , lord .
... a sit @-@ down with all the businesses on the block ,
and you are not invited .
okay , fine .
shh .
just take the rejection .
hi . oh , you guys open ?
yeah , yeah , we are . what can i get you to drink ?
ah , no , nothing .
i &apos;m just here to see the &quot; up &quot; toilet .
yeah , you are .
look , i just want you to know , when you drop me off ,
that &apos;s it-- i &apos;m ... not bothering you ever again .
good .
i just want to say one thing ...
please stop talking .
oh ! geez !
get out . i &apos;m calling you a car-- out !
sam , you were right to take a restraining order against me
because , ever since i saw you again ,
i can &apos;t stop thinking about you .
i &apos;m not the girl you used to know .
i &apos;m really together now .
i know i just went through a car wash , but ...
i &apos;m still very mad at you .
as you should be .
you taste like soap .
i feel like i &apos;m on grey &apos;s anatomy in these scrubs .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
300 feet away from each other-- now !
no ! we figured it out .
jessica day , take your hands off of this man .
dr. sam , friend face : good to see you .
cop face ... 300 feet away from her .
when did you become a cop , dude ?
oh , not too long ago .
congrats .
thank you . i appreciate that . it &apos;s nothing , you know .
i get to do a lot of cool stuff on the job .
i once slid across the hood of a car .
i scratched it all up .
i didn &apos;t have to pay for it , you know .
&apos;cause i &apos;m a cop , so ...
300 feet away .
i &apos;ve gathered the family here today
to end this terrible , terrible , unnecessary war .
so , thank you .
connie and i have had our battles ,
but today we make our peace .
she &apos;s of the north .
she &apos;s the owner of presh .
what is this ?
i only came because you said
you were suing me for what i did ,
which , by the way , was nothing .
i lied to ensure your presence .
good lord .
over here , we have peter verrebian .
yes .
enjoying the pasta .
he is also the owner of produce @-@ slash-
cold beer @-@ slash @-@ ice .
peter , i know that &apos;s what the sign above your market says .
is that the name of your establishment ?
yes .
very creative .
oh , and analysa from analysa &apos;s nails wanted to be here ,
but she couldn &apos;t find somebody to cover her register .
and if you &apos;ve ever gone in that place , it &apos;s messy .
like , it &apos;s not a great ...
establishment .
how did things get this far , everybody ?
this is so weird .
thank you for the spaghetti .
wasn &apos;t that a nice thing to say ?
i wish we were all so polite .
i &apos;d like to say something .
i don &apos;t need you here , schmidt .
connie ...
you know , presh may have booths
made of reclaimed wood
and carefully curated artisanal flatware ...
but this bar will have something
that your fancy place will never have .
what &apos;s that ?
nick miller .
oh . well .
no , we &apos;ll never have that .
of course i &apos;m proud that this bar breaks even ,
but i think that you can do better than that .
i didn &apos;t just invest in this bar , nick .
i invested in you .
no , you didn &apos;t .
you don &apos;t have equity in me , and we &apos;re ...
i get it .
hey , connie ...
yours isn &apos;t the only bar on the block
that has valet , starting immediately .
we have valet , kiddo .
you got valet .
you got valet .
this is beautiful .
the valet &apos;s yours . the valet &apos;s yours .
um ... are they in love ?
yes . very much so .
okay . hey , guys , um ...
let &apos;s just call a truce and end this .
if nothing else , so i can stop dealing with you .
i &apos;ll drink to that .
you got it .
okay .
a toast ? to us . salud !
okay .
this is good . this is really good .
uh , yeah . my buddy andy makes it in his basement .
i &apos;m not allowed to say anything else about it , though .
wow , i &apos;m not kidding .
i think this is the best whiskey that i &apos;ve ever had .
you want to go out with me sometime ?
what ? no . no .
no , no , no . never .
never .
but the whole back and forth
with , like , the fish and getting mad at each other ...
never . never .
when you came back and threw the fish down ... ?
nothing ... ?
where did you get there ,
from &quot; i like this whiskey &quot; to ... ?
what the hell was that ?
you know what ? let it go . let it go .
this was , this is my mistake . it was a misread ...
i would sooner make love to peter
and his mouthful of spaghetti .
pass .
okay , peter .
cheers .
298 , 299 ...
watch out for the lamp .
and that &apos;s 300 , right there . wait here .
i &apos;m dropping the restraining order . this isn &apos;t necessary .
i &apos;ll determine what &apos;s necessary ; i &apos;m a cop .
stop ! there &apos;s no more restraining order .
and no more cop face .
girl , this is my friend face .
honestly , i can &apos;t tell the difference .
well , there is no difference .
that &apos;s why i have to announce it .
and as your friend , winston ,
i just want to make sure that you two
have thought things through .
that you &apos;re not rushing into things ,
you know ?
you don &apos;t hurt each other again .
i &apos;m thinking , maybe , as your friend ,
maybe ... you should be restraining yourselves .
because of the restraining order ?
look , we &apos;ve grown up a lot .
we &apos;ve made mistakes and we &apos;ve learned from them .
jess , nobody takes out a restraining order
unless they think that they &apos;re in danger .
winston &apos;s right .
what ?
you &apos;re dangerous .
i mean , you &apos;re dangerous to me .
you want to know why i got the restraining order ?
&apos;cause i couldn &apos;t stop thinking about you either .
i didn &apos;t trust myself not to call you
and start this whole thing up again .
you know , you @-@ you &apos;ve changed , jess ,
and that &apos;s great , i just ... i haven &apos;t .
and i &apos;m still mad at you and ...
that &apos;s gonna take some time .
i think the , uh , best , smartest thing for us to do
is to just ...
say good @-@ bye .
what does selena gomez always say ?
&quot; take your things and go ... &quot;
the lyric is , &quot; take away your things and go . &quot;
&quot; take your things away and go ...
&quot; take away your things and go ... &quot;
&quot; take away your things and go . &quot;
yeah .
yes .
good @-@ bye , jess .
good @-@ bye , sam .
that &apos;s enough .
powerful stuff .
but i think we both know that it was for the best .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i &apos;ve been dealing with this all day
and i got some chores to get done .
cat box to clean , juice to popsicle @-@ ize ...
sam !
sam , wait ! wait !
sam ! sam ! hi .
look , i want to say i lied .
i said that i &apos;ve grown up ; i don &apos;t know that i have .
i just said that &apos; cause it sounded good .
get in .
oh , are we crazy ?
yes !
oh . ow ! sorry . no . sorry . no . sorry .
ow . yeah , yeah .
let me get this through the steering wheel here .
kiss my neck while i get the steering wheel .
over there .
hello !
quite a bit of traffic building up back there .
beep @-@ beep ! come on !
they can wait .
hurry up ! let &apos;s go !
get a room !
actually , i ... i really feel bad for them .
they &apos;re all ... they have to get somewhere , too .
they &apos;re getting a bit angry .
yeah , okay . let &apos;s go to your place .
