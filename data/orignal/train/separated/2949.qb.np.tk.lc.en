what &apos;s your news ?
thank you .
i got a job in advertising .
honey , that &apos;s incredible !
gosh , what &apos;s the pay like ?
oh , come on , people .
if i don &apos;t know who makes the most ..
how do i know who i like the most ? hi , joey .
it pays nothing . it &apos;s an internship .
we have interns at days of our lives .
right . so it &apos;ll be the same , except less sex with you .
what do you think they &apos;ll have you do there ?
it &apos;s a training program , but they hire the people they like .
that &apos;s great !
there &apos;s gonna be some grunt work ..
which will stink . a grown man getting people coffee is humiliating .
humiliating and noble .
thank you .
you know , if i didn &apos;t already have a job ..
i would &apos;ve been good in advertising .
ross , you did not come up with : &quot; got milk ? &quot;
yes , i did ! i did !
i should &apos;ve written it down .

is it a good play ?
it must be .
i read it and didn &apos;t understand a single word !
leonard hayes is starring in it .
yeah , and directing .
he was so good in that movie of macbeth .
you saw that ?
no , but i saw the previews .
they played it right before jackass .
he &apos;s done some amazing work .
oh , yeah .
i loved him in those phone commercials .
when the monkey hits him in the face with the giant rubber phone ..
maybe the monkey will be at the audition .
don &apos;t make me more nervous than i already am !
good morning .
can i get you a cup of coffee , sir ?
oh , no , no . i &apos;m an intern , just like you guys .
except for the tie , the briefcase and the fact that i can rent a car .
seriously , you &apos;re an intern ?
i &apos;m heading in a new career direction and you gotta start at the bottom .
dude .
i know i &apos;m a little older than you guys , but it &apos;s not like i &apos;m bob hope .
the comedian . uso .

and as you probably already know , this is leonard hayes .
jeff goldblum
it is so amazing to meet you . i am such a big fan of your work .
i &apos;ve been blessed with a lot of great roles .
tell me about it , huh ? &quot; unlimited nights and weekends ! &quot;
are you making fun of me ? because i am not a sellout .
i didn &apos;t do it for money . i believe in those phones !
i almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service .
no , i wasn &apos;t making fun of you . i think you were great in those commercials .
really ?
yeah .
well , i do bring a certain credibility to the role .
are you kidding ? when they shoot you out of that cannon ..
&quot; hang up that phone ! &quot;
one take .
wow .
so shall we read ?
oh , yeah , sure .
top of act 2 . this is my entrance . you got it ?
what the hell are you still doing here ?
i think you know .
bastard !
i am what you made me . you know what ? i could go right now .
go ! go !
i can &apos;t .
oh , i want to , long pause ..
but i can &apos;t .
so sorry . you &apos;re not supposed to say &quot; long pause . &quot;
oh ! oh , i thought that was your character &apos;s name . you know ?
i thought you were , like , an indian or something , you know , with the ..
no . thank you so much for coming in . we appreciate it . thank you .
you don &apos;t want me to do it again ?
i could do an accent .
no .
you know , southern . &quot; l could go right now , mon ! &quot; huh ?
my god in heaven .
joey , hang on . leonard , can we talk to you for a moment ?
yes ? you &apos;ve got to be kidding . he can &apos;t act .
i don &apos;t care if you think he &apos;s hot .
if you want to sleep with him , do it on your own time . this is a play .
if you insist on this ..
i will call my agent so fast ..
on a cell phone connection so clear , he &apos;s gonna think i &apos;m next door !
hi , thank you so much for whispering for my benefit .
tell me what i did wrong . i &apos;d love to work on it and try it again for you .
and also , how you doing ?
give me another chance . i really want to get better . please ?
if you want to come back today ..
here are my notes . ready ?
yeah .
you &apos;re in your head . thinking too much .
i really doubt that .
no , no . it &apos;s that you &apos;re not connected with anything in your body .
there &apos;s no urgency . the scene is a struggle .
it &apos;s a race . also , what you did was horizontal .
don &apos;t be afraid to explore the vertical .
and don &apos;t learn the words . let the words learn you .
couldn &apos;t i just sleep with the producer ?
i &apos;m gonna blow
hey , do you want to go to dinner tonight ?
i can &apos;t . i &apos;ve got a date with that waitress , katie .
i know we &apos;ve only gone out , like , twice , but i don &apos;t know ..
i have a good feeling about her .
oh , i hear divorce bells .
give me your wallets , and there won &apos;t be a problem .
what ?
i have a gun .
okay , relax , phoebe . just stay calm .
oh , my god , i can &apos;t find my wallet !
all right , lady , now give me your purse .
no .
what do you mean &quot; no &quot; ? i knew you &apos;d be my death , phoebe buffay !
lowell , is that you ?
phoebe ?
oh , my god !
unbelievable ! oh , my god !
i &apos;m sorry . ross , this is my old friend , lowell , from the streets !
lowell , ross .
ross , nice to meet you .
yeah , a real pleasure .
it &apos;s been so long ! oh , so long .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re still doing this .
i know . but i quit smoking .
good for you .
you look like you &apos;re doing well .
i guess your mugging days are behind you .
oh , my god . phoebe , you used to mug people ?
excuse me , ross , old friends catching up .
how &apos;d the audition go ?
they want to see me again , but ..
leonard hayes did not like me .
what happened ?
he said i wasn &apos;t urgent enough .
everything i did was horizontal , and i should be more vertical .
he said that i should think less .
well , so far so good .
honey , i &apos;m old !
i didn &apos;t know you were coming home for lunch.can i get you anything ?
sure , a tube of polident ?
some depends ? birthday wishes from willard scott .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i am so much older than these other interns . i can &apos;t compete with them .
so you &apos;re a little older .
look at the positive . you have all this life experience .
yes , but i don &apos;t think life experience is gonna help me with these .
wow ! it &apos;s like they &apos;re on fire !
what are they ?
prototype sneakers .
i need ideas on how to sell them . which i can &apos;t do ..
because no self @-@ respecting adult would ever wear these .
i &apos;ll give you $ 500 for them .
what am i supposed to do ?
come on , sneakers are easy .
you wear them all the time .
they &apos;re not called sneakers anymore .
they &apos;re called &quot; kicks &quot; or &quot; skids . &quot; i think i heard somebody say &quot; slorps . &quot;
they &apos;ve got wheels that pop out from the bottom so you can roll around ..
because apparently walking is too much exercise .
&quot; kids ! kids ! roll your way to childhood obesity ! &quot;
kids today have such an easier time getting fat .
would you help me try to sell these ?
okay . have you considered using a girl with huge knockers ?
that &apos;s not what they &apos;re looking for .
hey , that would work on me .
why do you think i buy mrs. butterworth &apos;s ?
you &apos;ll never guess what just happened .
phoebe and i got mugged !
are you okay ?
yeah . phoebe knew the mugger .
how do you know a mugger ?
i &apos;m sorry , i have friends outside the six of us .
know how she knew him ? because phoebe used to mug people .
seriously ?
well , i &apos;m not proud of it , but , you know ..
when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff ..
that is awful .
i wasn &apos;t rich like you guys , okay ?
i didn &apos;t eat gold and have a flying pony .
i had a hard life . my mother was killed by a drug dealer .
your mother killed herself .
she was a drug dealer .
it was a good thing she knew him . i was about to do some serious damage .
okay .
this must have brought back some bad memories for you , ross .
why ?
ross was mugged as a kid .
you were ?
yeah . and it was pretty traumatic .
it was outside st. mark &apos;s comics .
i was minding my business , seeing what kind of trouble spider @-@ man was into .
wonder woman .
anyway , i was heading towards this bakery ..
to pick up a couple of dozen linzer tortes for someone ..
when out of nowhere , this thug with a pipe jumps out and says :
&quot; give me your money , punk ! &quot;
oh , my god .
i know . and the worst part was , they took my backpack ..
which had all the original artwork i did for my own comic book , science boy .
oh , yeah ! what was his super power again ?
a super @-@ human thirst for knowledge .
i better get to class .
are there any more of your friends i should look out for ?
no . actually , you might want to stay away from jane street .
that &apos;s where stabby joe works .
i think we have a problem here .
what ?
back in my mugging days , i worked st. mark &apos;s comics .
yeah ?
a pipe was my weapon of choice ..
and preteen , comic @-@ book nerds were my meat .
so ?
there was one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said :
&quot; geology rocks ! &quot;
&quot; geology rocks ! &quot;
oh , my god !
i know ! i mugged ross !
you &apos;re late .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
but can i just run to the bathroom ?
no . leonard doesn &apos;t wait .
but i am bursting with yoo @-@ hoo !
joey , here we go ! let &apos;s go . very quickly .
i really need ..
we must go now , quickly .
yeah . yes , sir .
ready ?
what the hell are you still doing here ?
i think you know !
oh , you sick bastard !
i am what you made me ! know what ?
what ?
i could go right now .
then go . go !
oh , i can &apos;t . i want to , but i can &apos;t !
cut . that was good !
very good . you did everything i asked .
i did ?
yes . plus which , you &apos;ve got this , i don &apos;t know , this squirmy quality ..
you bring to the character i couldn &apos;t have imagined .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do :
come back tomorrow for the final callbacks .
do all of this , what you got going now . but you know what ?
more . more . can you do that ?
sure . i don &apos;t have time to say thank you because i really gotta go !
look at that ! still in character . i like him .
i plant seeds . i can &apos;t explain it . i don &apos;t know .
hey . what are you doing ?
putting on the sneakers ..
to get in the young mindset , see if it sparks anything .
oh , anything yet ?
yes , how &apos;s this ?
&quot; they &apos;re so uncomfortable , it &apos;s like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet . &quot;
you &apos;re probably wondering what i &apos;m doing .
no , that seems about right .
yesterday at my audition , i had to pee . apparently , that makes me a good actor .
i got a callback , so i &apos;m drinking everything . oh , by the way ..
that eggnog in our fridge was great !
joey , that was formula .
we gotta get more of that .
these aren &apos;t half bad . you should suggest these to ralph lauren .
okay , first of all , that &apos;s stupid . second , i &apos;m not allowed to talk to ralph .
all right . i feel younger already .
yeah , i think i broke my hip .
hey , you !
hey .
hey . how was class ?
no one asks me that . what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i really want to know .
oh .
well , there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene ..
all right , nothing is worth this .
i have a confession to make .
okay , you know that girl that mugged you when you were a kid ?
what are you talking about ? it wasn &apos;t a girl . it was this huge dude .
he had a pitchfork and a sword .
you don &apos;t have to lie anymore . i know that it was a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
yes , it was .
you don &apos;t think i would have defended myself against a 14 @-@ year @-@ old .. ?
&quot; give me your money , punk ! &quot;
oh , my god , it was you !
i can &apos;t believe it . you mugged me ?
yeah . and i &apos;m so , so sorry , ross . i &apos;m sorry .
but , you know , if you think about it , it &apos;s kind of neat .
i mean , well , it &apos;s just that i &apos;ve always felt kind of like an outsider .
you know , the rest of you have connections that go way back ..
and , you know , now you and i have a great one .
it &apos;s not the best !
i know . please forgive me . i don &apos;t know what to say .
there &apos;s nothing you can say ! that was the most humiliating thing ever .
even more humiliating than ..
let &apos;s not do this !
and then , at the end of the commercial , the girls get out of the hot tub ..
and start making out with each other .
that &apos;s interesting .
just one thought : you didn &apos;t mention the shoes .
who &apos;s next ? chandler .
you start with a guy putting on the shoes .
he &apos;s about my age .
your age ?
he &apos;s rolling down the street and he starts to lose control .
maybe he falls . maybe he hurts himself .
just then , a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes .
he jumps over the old guy and laughs . and the line reads :
&quot; not suitable for adults . &quot;
well , chandler , that &apos;s great .
thank you , sir .
or , man who &apos;s two years younger than me .
you see , that has a clear selling point . it appeals to our key demographic .
how did you come up with that ?
i don &apos;t know ! i don &apos;t know !
i was just trying to get into a young mindset , and stuff started to flow .
that is great . good work .
thank you .
we &apos;ll see all of you tomorrow .
the cold weather hurts my hip .
hey , ross . i know you &apos;re still mad at me , but can i just talk to you for a sec ?
sure , go ahead . oh , sorry . sure , go ahead .
i just really wanted to apologize again .
and also show you something i think you &apos;ll find very exciting .
oh , my god ! &quot; crap from the street ! &quot;
look , ross . in this box ..
are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell ..
or smoke .
anyway , i was looking through it , and i found ..
science boy .
oh , my god !
i never thought i &apos;d see this again .
it &apos;s all here !
what made you save it all these years ?
i guess i just thought it was really good .
and maybe it would be worth something one day .
you really thought science boy was worth saving ?
yeah . but you should know i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here .
still , this is amazing !
oh , my god . thank you , phoebe .
you &apos;re welcome . thank you for science boy . i learned a lot from him .
you &apos;re welcome .
wait a minute . did you add something to him ?
oh , yeah .
you see , the way you drew him ..
there was no way he was ever gonna get gravity girl .
he looked like a ken doll in those tights .
what &apos;s that ? what are you .. ?
&quot; is that a beaker or are you happy to see me ? &quot;
i don &apos;t get it .
i need an answer !
i can &apos;t tell you something i don &apos;t know .
you know !
i don &apos;t know !
i need an answer now !
you want an answer ? the answer is ..
she never loved me . she only loved you .
you knew this all along and you never told me ?
i can never forgive you , or myself . i have nothing to live for . bang ! and scene !
absolutely amazing .
the part is yours .
thanks ! now i really gotta go .
no , wait ! congratulations ! you did it .
you did it . you can relax now . yeah .
wow ! that &apos;s a big cable bill .
you don &apos;t have a job , but you have no problem ordering porn .
on a saturday afternoon ?
i was in the house !
hey . phoebe didn &apos;t by any chance mention that ..
she was the huge guy that mugged you ? yeah .
i see . you didn &apos;t happen to tell ..
