You think you can help me?
We talked to your mum,
and she said that there was a witness.
Patrick Molloy, he worked at the rec center.
That's where I was the afternoon Mrs. Johnson was killed.
I do want you to get better,
but not for me but for yourself.
Well, as long as I have you I can do that.
I do have you, right?
Yes, you do.
Of course divorce is gonna cost a ton, so...
How much?
5,000 bucks.
Good thing that's not your problem, huh?
Think anyone would notice
if we went upstairs for a little bit?
I don't really think
this whole friends- with-benefits thing is working out.
If you're gonna go around and tell everyone
we're like boyfriends,
you should at least ask me out first.
I have some, uh, tax issues with the IRS.
How bad is it?
There's a lien on their house.
You mean they could lose their home?
I don't understand.
How can there be a lien on our home?
Your dad's on the title, love.
That's how we got approved for the loan.
And plus the $200,000 that Dana and I loaned you
for the down payment on the house.
Uh, what about yours and Dana's house, Stewart?
Well, the IRS doesn't go after the debtors' primary residence.
But they'll come after ours?
Listen, I would be more than happy to sell our home,
but we're already upside down on the mortgage.
How could you let this happen, Daddy?
Well, we lost a lot of money
when the stock market crashed in '08,
and then that was the money we were supposed to retire on,
and then we couldn't pay the income tax.
Are we gonna lose our home?
No! No! Absolutely not.
Okay, how much do you owe, Stewart?
Well, it's, uh, not all that much.
Um, I'm meeting today with a tax lawyer
who, uh, specializes in negotiating with the IRS.
I'll work something out. I promise, don't worry.
Okay, well, uh...
Hi, Grandpa.
How's my... gorgeous girl?
Where's Grams?
She had to leave early.
She had to sub for a class for a colleague,
but she said to say how sorry she was
and to give you all a big kiss good-bye.
Hey, take it easy, Miss Thing.
Come on.
Sorry.
I've got a STEAM club meeting this morning.
What's STEAM?
I thought it was STEM?
"Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts..."
they just added that...and...
Mistake.
I would have never agreed to joining your club
if I had known that I had to wake up this early.
You joined STEM...STEAM?
Jesus is helping us build a robot.
Hey, did you guys every see that...
the Terminator movie?
Any day now computers are gonna take over the world.
They already have, Grandpa.
Well, I better get ready for my meeting.
So, uh...
hasta la vista, babies.
I'll be back.
Why do we have to go so early?
I thought the down payment
your parents gave us for the house
was your early inheritance.
Since when did it become a loan?
Since they need it back, I guess.
Jesus, we got to go.
Uh, Mariana.
Sweetheart, can I speak to you for a second
before you go, please?
Is there any reason that Nick would be under the impression
that...that you want to come and see him again?
No, why?
Well, I just...I got a call from his doctor,
and, uh, apparently Nick asked
when you were coming to visit him again.
Well, I'm not.
And why aren't his doctors doing their job?
I mean, I can't be Nick's only reason for living!
Okay, no worries, love.
I'll take care of it.
All right?
Get to school, you guys, get to school.
So you're not gonna tell her about the hearing?
Well, you see how well that went.
Can you imagine how she's gonna react if I tell her
that they're trying to get Nick released from the hospital?
Have a good day. See you.
See you.
Oh God.
What? What...what?
What are you doing?
Your mom.
Oh, God, she's coming over.
Hey, B.
Oh, Hi, I didn't see you there.
I dropped my phone under the seat.
I hate it when that happens.
Going surfing?
Oh, yeah.
I haven't been in a while.
Yeah, surfing's like her, uh... her therapy.
That's nice.
Uh, Brandon, the bell's about to ring.
Uh, so have fun,
and I will see you later.
So, Mom tells me that you gave Cortney money.
I loaned her money, yeah,
but she's gonna pay me back.
Well, in my experience,
sometimes people can mistake a loan for a gift
and vice versa.
So how are you paying for food and parties?
Well, you know, I'm still working at the Smokehouse.
Making a hundred bucks a week in tips.
Look, mama, you don't have to worry.
I just hope that Cortney's pulling her weight,
not just catching waves.
Do you want to do something later?
Can't. I have to work on my senior project.
Oh, how's that going?
You know, if you need my help, you can just ask me.
See, I'm afraid you'd just be a distraction.
I'm never giving in!
Watch out.
Ah, sucker!
Grow up! What is wrong with them?
They're seniors.
Exactly.
They're playing water ninja.
It's a school tradition.
How have I been here for, like, a few weeks
and I know more about this than you do?
Didn't you get your email with your target's name?
Pass.
Oh, so you're just too cool for school, huh?
No, I'm too cool for water balloon fights.
Come on, Callie, it's fun.
Not everything has to be so serious.
There is no way I'm passing this week's midterm.
Maybe you should ask Noah to tutor you.
What, is he like a math genius too?
I wouldn't be surprised.
He's pretty smart.
So what's going on with you guys?
We're just hanging out.
He's coming over after school.
Oh, really?
We're probably just friends.
Probably? It didn't look like "just friends"
at the dance floor of your mom's party.
You know one thing Noah's not?
A dancer.
His moves were a little experimental.
It's probably because he was stoned.
What? No way.
Uh, yeah, way.
It's always the preacher's kids you got to watch out for.
Nick's doctors no longer feel
that he is a danger to himself,
and since he has no criminal record
or history of delinquent behavior,
we're asking that he be sent
to the Mission Bay Home for Delinquent Boys
where he'll continue to receive psychiatric care and therapy
in a secure environment.
What about being a danger to others?
And you are?
Your Honor,
my name is Stefanie Adams Foster.
I was one of the police officers on-site
during the lockdown at Anchor Beach
when Nick Stratos brought a gun to school.
Allegedly! No one ever saw my son with a gun at school.
Your son broke into our house
and laid in wait for 24 hours
until he was able to get my daughter alone
and threatened her at gunpoint.
He never threatened to hurt your daughter!
Mr. Stratos,
I'd like to hear what officer Adams-Foster has to say.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Um, Nick Stratos has only been
under psychiatric treatment for a couple of weeks,
hardly enough time to determine
that he is not a threat to himself
or anyone else for that matter.
Are you a doctor?
Your Honor, this has been very difficult on my wife and me,
but our son has been victimized
by a girl who is toying with his affections,
and Ms. Adams-Foster...
Mrs.
Right, Mrs.
Give my regards to your wife.
I will, thank you.
Mrs. Adams-Foster has no reason to feel
that my son is a threat to her daughter.
Then why is he still asking to see Mariana?
What are you talking about?
His doctors called me this morning,
because Nick apparently asked
when Mariana was coming to visit him.
I'm happy to get Dr. Stolland on the phone, Your Honor.
Nick, is this true?
Yes.
I gave her a necklace with a diamond "M" on it,
and I wanted to ask her if I could have it back
to give to my mom.
You know, "M" for Mom.
I wanted to give her something special
for standing by me through this.
I understand I'm not in a relationship with Mariana any more
and why she doesn't want to see me.
I'm not angry about it.
I'm truly sorry for everything I did.
I just...
want to get better
so that I can pay for my mistakes...
and get on with my life.
Just wanted to drop off
Brandon's letter of recommendation for Juilliard.
Thank you so much, Eric.
I haven't seen much of him around the music room lately.
I hope he's practicing.
He's got to put 120 percent into this.
He is. He's been practicing at home
and he even took the SATs again
to improve on his score, which was already pretty high.
Um, he's be better off focusing on his audition.
Juilliard doesn't even require SAT scores,
unless the student's home-schooled.
Does Brandon know that?
Yeah. I'm pretty sure we talked about it.
Anyway, I'll see you.
Okay.
If I knew being a nerd was this fun,
I would have converted much sooner.
It doesn't fit.
This is three millimeters from the edge you measured?
Uh, yeah, three millimeters
from the edge of the rod to the edge of the hole.
No, three millimeters from the edge of the rod
to the center of the hole.
That's useless. Do it again.
Right, this is very complex work
and any little error can cost us big time,
so if you don't understand something,
you need to ask for clarification.
Got it.
Hey, Mariana.
I think we should get the omni wheels.
They can move in any direction
and they're cool as hell.
Yeah, no, you've seen the field.
We have to be able to make sure we can get over the obstacles.
It's not like omni wheels can't go straight,
unless... are you afraid you won't be able to drive it?
I'm happy to take over as driver if you want.
No thanks.
Okay, but make sure that we have enough control.
I'll order them now.
Um, why did you just back down?
We have to pick our battles. It should be fine.
Just let the boys have their toys.
Should be fine?
Seriously?
I can't deal with you second-guessing me right now, okay?
他们要把我转移到新的地方 来见我
Hey, what was that about? Did she say something about me?
Hello.
What?
What did Emma say?
Look, I can't deal with your drama right now.
Who are you texting?
Huh? Mariana!
Just mind your own business! Okay?
Everything okay?
Who's home?
Uh, I don't think anyone yet.
Why? What's... what's going on?
I called Coronado High.
Your name's not on the list of students who took the SATs.
Uh, that... that's weird.
Maybe they forgot to log my name in or something.
And you realize that Juilliard doesn't require SAT scores?
Uh, yeah, well, you know, I mean, it wasn't
it wasn't going to be the only school I applied to.
Did you take that test for yourself?
Or for someone else?
Why... why would I?
For money!
You realize what you've done?
You've committed academic fraud!
The consequence of which is no Juilliard,
no college, period!
What? Do they know?
I know!
And you have put me in a terrible position, Brandon,
because if I report this,
which I am ethically and professionally required to do,
I will be responsible
for completely destroying your future!
Okay, I'm sorry.
Sorry's not gonna cut it, Brandon!
First, everything with Callie and now this...
what is going on with you?
Cortney's ex is... is suing for custody!
So she needs a lawyer.
She needs the money for a lawyer.
Brandon, when you continue to justify your actions,
it's a pretty clear sign
that you have lost your sense of right and wrong.
I can't even look at you right now.
So I looked into Kyle's alibi witness,
Patrick Molloy,
and it turns out that he was arrested
for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor.
When was this?
A couple months before Kyle's trial.
So did he go to prison?
No, the charges were dropped.
Well, I did find something odd in the arrest report
that a lead detective on Kyle's case... Detective Gray...
was called in to question Patrick Molloy
after he was arrested.
So?
Well, Gray is in the homicide unit
and the molestation case belonged Vice.
Those guys are very territorial.
So, why would they do that?
I have a theory.
Oh, watch out for the wall!
Sorry, I'm kinda lame at this.
My mom doesn't like me to play video games.
She thinks they mess with your head.
Oh my God, get that stuff away from me.
Candy is totally my kryptonite.
What? You've got like the munchies?
You stoned?
Taylor told me you were high at my mom's birthday party.
Oh! Yeah.
I mean, no.
No, I'm not high right now,
but yeah, I... I have a medical marijuana card.
How? You're fifteen.
My mom got it for me.
The same mom who's afraid
video games will mess with your head?
It's for my anxiety.
I get nervous around large crowds, and new people.
I guess she'd rather me have something natural
rather than a prescription drug or something.
Have you ever tried it?
Uh, no.
Do you want to?
Wh... do you mean right now?
No. No, I don't...
I don't have any on me right now.
My mom limits how much I get,
but I, uh... I save some for...
fun.
If you want, I can bring it over tomorrow.
Yeah, sure, cool.
So this Detective Gray
would put a child molester back on the streets
just to make sure that Kyle was convicted
of Mrs. Johnson's murder?
Yeah, it's horrible,
but my mom said that detectives
are under so much pressure to close their cases,
and some of them are just willing to do whatever it takes.
And Molloy will never admit that he made a deal,
because if he did, he could still be charged.
Yeah, and possibly go to jail.
So we're back to where we started
with no alibi witness for Kyle.
Which is why I went to Sheila's this afternoon
to pick up all of Kyle's case files.
My mom told me
I'm not supposed to be like detectiving or anything,
but she never said we couldn't do this.
I've never seen my mom so mad.
God, this is all my fault.
No, it's not.
It was my choice to take that test.
I just wish I hadn't.
What's this?
It's 900 bucks.
I know it's just a dent in what I owe you,
but I'm paying every penny back.
Where did you get this?
I sold my surfboarding gear.
Cort, you love surfing.
You can't be the only one making sacrifices, Brandon.
We're gonna get through all of this, okay?
Together.
I, uh, spoke to your mother today.
She called you?
No, I called her.
Your dad has not exactly been telling us the truth, Lena.
According to my mother,
who just abandoned him here as soon as things got rough.
She didn't abandon him.
She went home, and it's a good thing she did
because she was able to go through their financial records.
Well, I'm sure she's making it seem a lot worse
than it really is.
He owes the IRS almost $300,000, Lena.
How is that even possible?
Well, he lost money in the stock market,
but then he tried to recoup it,
making a lot of bad, high-risk investments,
and they're upside down on the house
because he took out a second and third mortgage.
He hasn't paid his income taxes in four years.
I mean...
it's as if he's...
he kept doubling down on these get-rich-quick schemes...
Okay! Enough!
My father's made some mistakes,
but I don't appreciate you calling my mother
and ganging up on him.
He needs our support.
He has to go home and face his wife
and their financial situation.
And we need to figure out how to save our house.
Well, I'm not gonna tell him he has to leave.
You and my mother can doubt him all you want,
but he's always come through for us.
So if he says he's gonna fix this, I believe him.
What's that?
This is the forensics report.
Oh, no, I mean... that.
Oh, that is the school project that won't die.
Um, I had this idea to do it on all the foster homes
that my little brother and I were in,
but right now it just seems lame.
Why?
I don't know. It's just not important.
Okay, so this forensics report is really disturbing.
"Mrs. Johnson was found in her living room,
face down in a pool of blood.
"She was bludgeoned in the back of the head with a garden axe."
There's no sign of forced entry,
and Kyle's DNA all over the murder weapon.
Okay, but Kyle did yard work for her, right?
So wouldn't his DNA be all over the gardening tools anyway?
Yeah.
Wait.
It's missing a page.
Look, it goes right from page six of eight
to eight of eight. Where is page seven?
That is a good question.
What's going on?
This is Aaron.
He's helping me look through Kyle's case files.
You're supposed to working on your senior project.
Yeah, actually, um, I was thinking of maybe changing it
to be about Kyle's case,
like juvenile justice.
No, Callie, you're not changing your project again!
Why not?
Because you've already changed it three times!
There's a reason you wanted
to do seven homes in seven years,
one that made a lot of sense to Mom and me.
Aaron, I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Callie has to focus on her school work.
Can I take that?
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too.
Well, that was rude.
I am sorry you feel that way,
but we think that it's time you commit to this project,
and that you commit to the family,
as a matter of fact.
So how about you stop making excuses
and get it done!
Cool, right?
Yeah, it's cool, but, uh,
why are we doing swerve drive?
Sorry, my bad.
You've seen the field.
There's no way those omni wheels
are gonna be able to get over those obstacles.
We talked about this.
Simple is better.
Yeah, no, you're right.
We'll swap them out.
We can't afford to make mistakes like this, Mariana.
If we do, we're never gonna be ready in time.
Okay, so I'll take care of getting the new wheels,
but we have to make up for some lost time,
so you should probably start coding
for basic drive...
and then we'll upload it whenever the new wheels get in.
Okay.
Oh, and thanks for hanging me out to dry with Craig.
Hey, you're the team leader.
You're right. I am.
Hey, can you give me a ride?
What's up? Everything good?
Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm fine.
Uh, we miss you.
Miss you too.
Hey, what's up with that... that new guy?
Is he, uh...
No. I'm not sure yet.
Gotcha.
You ever done pot?
Well, I mean, are you wearing like a wire or something?
No.
I did it once. Yeah.
But... why? Are you thinking of trying it?
No, no! I... I, um...
You know, I just heard some other kids talking about it
and I was wondering what it was like.
I didn't like it.
I... I kind of just got paranoid,
and my head kept jumping from one thought to the next.
It was like an acid trip or something like that.
That was a bad example.
Actually, I've never done acid.
Don't do acid.
I don't know, I... I kind of panicked
and had to call Mama to come pick me up.
You did? Was she mad?
No, actually, she was... really cool,
but... I felt pretty stupid.
You know what? I'm gonna catch you later. Okay?
Hey, man. Hey.
What's up, bro?
Uh, we got to talk.
So...
When you asked for a ride home,
I sort of thought maybe you wanted...
No.
No, sorry, just a ride.
You know what I don't get?
What teenage boy gives up no-strings-attached sex?
What does it matter?
Can't you get your benefits from some other friend?
Yeah, I can.
I can get all the benefits I want,
any time I want from any friend too.
Good, then what do you need me for?
I mean, you don't think I'm good enough for you anyway.
Why would you say that?
I think you know.
Actually, I'm pretty sure I don't!
You think I'm dumb, Emma.
Why do you...
I don't think you're dumb.
Come on!
We both know that I'm not smart enough for you,
and that's why you won't date me.
The reason I won't date you is because...
you broke my heart.
No, you broke up with me.
Because I didn't think you were...
into me.
You know that's not true.
Then why did you immediately start hooking up with Hayley
like two seconds after it was over with us?
Hayley was a mistake.
I only got with her,
because I thought that you didn't want me.
Well, that sucks big time.
Well, I'm sorry!
So... do you think maybe I...
that I could unbreak your heart?
Is that Mariana?
Is that what we're doing here?
Following her?
Oh my God!
What the hell is she doing?
I was thinking about you today.
I saw this Vine of this guy
who ate like 1,000 pounds of candy.
Oh, yeah, funny.
So I made a playlist
of some music I like to chill with.
Yeah, so...
Listen, I...
I don't think I'm really ready to smoke pot.
Uh, uh, okay.
The thing is we're not smoking it.
We're eating it.
Hey, Mama.
Hey, um...
So I just wanted to let you know
that I'm... I'm making this whole SAT-thing right.
I gave the money back to the kid
that I took the test for
and I'm making him take it himself,
and to use whatever score he gets.
That way, you know, you don't have to
compromise your integrity or anything.
Okay.
Uh, I mean.
I... I thought you'd be happy
that I'm fixing this.
Like you fixed things
buying back those fake ID's you made?
It's the fact that you did these things at all,
Brandon, that concerns me.
A character is much easier kept than recovered.
I hope you remember that next time.
The universe is collapsing
on itself.
Stephen Hawking?
The smartest man in the world?
No?
Dude!
Did you just call me Jude?
No, that's my name.
Yeah, that's why I thought it was weird.
No, but I just wanted to tell you
that I can feel my bones,
like, inside my skin.
Hey, doors open please.
Dinner's almost ready.
Noah, you are welcome to join us if you'd like.
Oh, thank you, but I got to get home.
Okay.
What is this?
Don't ruin your appetite before dinner, please.
Do you think she knew?
No, we're cool.
But, man, you never told me your mom was the po-po.
Po-po?
Hey, Daddy.
Hey, so,
I think I found a solution to our problems.
Well, great, what's the plan?
Well, it's more of an opportunity, really.
See, if we can just scrape together $20,000,
we could buy shares in this company
that is about to announce that it has developed
an affordable technique
to desalinate sea water using solar power.
Now within the next few months,
they are projecting 10
to 20 times the return on their investment.
I could pay off the IRS
and then even your line of credit loan on the house,
and then...
the lien goes away.
Um, Daddy, that sounds pretty risky.
It's a no-brainer.
I mean, water is the new oil.
I mean, trust me on this, honey.
This is the answer to our problems.
Dad.
We know how much you owe the IRS.
You've been talking to your mother.
Yes, we... we called her...
and we know everything.
We know about the second and third mortgages...
and we know about
all the get-rich-quick schemes.
Yeah, well, this is different.
This is different. I am right about this.
We can't afford for you to be wrong again.
You are making a mistake here, honey!
No, no, you've made mistakes, Dad!
You've lost everything and you're in denial about it.
Stewart, you keep dodging the IRS,
you're gonna end up in jail.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I still have my life insurance.
I could probably drive off a cliff.
You'd all be okay.
Daddy, don't say that.
Don't ever say that.
We would never be okay without you.
All I ever wanted was to take care of my family.
I know.
I know.
Was it something I said?
Don't even think about it.
Dinner's gonna be ready soon.
Come on, I'm starving.
Then eat a veggie, here.
Uh, potato chips are technically a vegetable.
You know what, young man?
Hey, sweets.
Um, can I talk to you about Nick?
Uh, should I go?
No, no, no, you need to hear this too.
Nick has been released from the hospital,
and has been moved to a group home for boys.
Is he okay, mentally?
That remains to be seen,
but according to the doctors
and the judge who approved the move,
they seemed to think so.
He is still under lock and key.
He has no access to phones or computers,
and I have made it quite clear to them
that he is not to contact either one of you,
but if he does, you need to let me know.
Okay.
All right, and I'm gonna be closely monitoring his detention
and activities, so there's no need for you to worry at all.
I'm not worried.
It's like the most depressing scrapbook ever.
This was a horrible idea. No one's gonna want to see this.
I don't want to see this.
I hate that this is my story.
I just want to pretend it never happened.
But you can't.
Look, it's hard to look back on the rough stuff.
I mean, I'm transgender, I get it.
When I see pictures before my transition...
I see how sad I was.
I just wanted to erase the first 16 years of my life,
but you can't let go of all that pain and sadness
when you lock it in.
This little girl you keep pushing away,
she's still here,
and she needs to know that you love her,
you've got her back.
You can't save yourself without saving her.
And you can't do that until you face the fact
that you just got a really raw deal.
It sucks.
I know.
I have a friend who's transgender.
Really? You're giving me
the, uh, "I have a friend" speech?
You know, we don't all know each other, right?
I know that.
I didn't...
His name's Cole.
Oh, wow, well, actually, I, uh... I do know Cole.
He's a great guy.
Sorry, I didn't even ask you why you're here.
Oh, uh, one of the lawyers from the JJC
got the police to send over the missing fax page.
And?
Nothing remarkable:
blood spatter analysis and stuff about the murder weapon,
angle and direction of impact,
probable height and weight of the killer...
nothing really useful.
The missing page was probably just an oversight.
So we're probably just wasting our time.
Why did you lie to Mom?
Lie about what?
Emma and I followed you after school today.
Are you serious?
I can't believe you did that!
Yeah, and I can't believe you're still seeing Nick!
Are you sure you're not the one who's crazy?
Keep your voice down.
Look...
When I went to go see Nick at the hospital,
he told me that I was the only reason he didn't kill himself,
that I was his only reason for living.
So?
So!
Every time he gets to a phone,
he texts me that he can't go on without me,
and that if he didn't have me,
he'd like end it all right now.
I couldn't tell him it was over.
Not yet.
He just...
needs some time to get better.
And what does it matter if he thinks
that I'm his girlfriend as long as he's locked up.
Dad should be back home by now.
Hope Dana lets him in the house.
I think we're gonna have to help them
get out from under this.
I don't think my dad can do it alone.
You saw how broken he is.
I'm not sure what we can do.
Still nervous for the midterm?
Nah, I'm all good.
You wrote the code in LabVIEW?
Yeah, and?
No one on the team knows LabVIEW.
So what?
So what if we have to change something?
Well, then I'll change it.
And what if you're not there?
Or what if we have to ask one of the other teams for help?
What's the big deal?
You should have done it in Java or C++.
Well, too late.
No, it's not too late. Do it over.
I'm not doing it over.
Look, you said we're behind anyways,
you know, 'cause you made the wrong call on the omni wheels.
Do it again in Java.
Why're you being such a bitch?
Because bitches get things done.
Do it in Java or you're off the team.
You know what?
Code it yourself.
I'm out. Who's with me?
What? What was that for?
You have just been water ninja'ed.
I'm your target?
No, no, I just wanted to prove to you that I can be fun.
It's a good shot, right?
Yeah, and with your left hand too,
it's pretty good.
Oh, you are so gonna get it.
I hope so.
I'll see you later?
Not if I see you first.
Hey, Aaron, it's Callie.
I think I might know why the prosecutor
didn't want Kyle's lawyer to see the forensics report.
It says that the killer was right-handed,
but Kyle's not. He's left-handed.
Well, you have a lovely home,
and there is a huge demand for Craftsmans in San Diego.
I don't think you'll have any trouble selling your house.
I'd love the opportunity to be your realtor.
