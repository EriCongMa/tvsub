To a degree, medicine is a science.
It's been six hours on the boat.
Yes.
And you've talked about fishing.
Yes.
For six hours.
Pretty much, yeah.
Derek.
What do you want me to say?
We went fishing, we talked about fishing.
I want the whole story.
It is the whole story.
She caught a fish and cried, it's not the whole story.
Except it is the whole story. It's in fact the entire story.
I'm ovulating.
But I would argue that it's also an art.
I mean, you stole my best friend, and it's not okay.
It's not okay for the two of you to hang out like I don't exist.
I am not hanging out.
I am trying to help her.
By hanging out with her.
We gonna do this or not?
I'm too mad to even look at you.
Well, then roll over.
Fine.
The doctors who see medicine as science only
you don't want them by your side when your bleeding won't stop
or when your child is screaming in pain.
You look different.
You seem better.
I feel better.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
So you got plans?
I think I'm gonna explore the city today.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
You know, I've never had time to do it before...
or the interest.
Hello.
Teddy, you're doing what?
The clinicians go by the book.
The artists follow their guts.
Nope.
Oh. You're gonna make us late.
Okay.
Okay.
Go. Go.
Nope.
The artists feel your pain,
and they go to extremes to make it stop.
You sat here all night?
Um... Well... No.
I just flew in from Africa, so I went to a hotel
and took a shower, got some sleep,
and came back really early.
Really, please...
go back to Malawi.
Extreme measures--
That's where science ends and art begins.
We can do this another day if you want?
No, no. I mean, no, we're here now,
and--and--and he'll be here.
Hey. Oh, hey, my witness is here.
Okay, let's get this thing started.
Teddy, you're not seriously gonna do this.
Yeah, I am.
Henry Burton.
Owen Hunt.
Okay, then. Will you be reading vows
or do you just want a standard ceremony?
Oh, crap. Uh, it's work. Um,
I'm just gonna let it roll.
Standard ceremony?
Well, maybe if you could just skip to the end.
Sorry. I'm--I'm just-- I'm really late.
Excuse me. Can you direct me to the space needle?
It's your, uh, first time in Seattle, huh?
Um... Sure, okay.
Yeah. You're just gonna, uh, you wanna go west on Union
about, uh, eight blocks or so.
And then you turn north and then you should...
Must be a bad accident.
Hey, that's not west.
You're--you're going the wrong way.
I'll travel to Malawi every two months
for the next three years to oversee everything,
and I got a leading pediatric surgeon
to oversee the day-to-day operations.
Well, Dr. Robbins, i signed a contract with a new peds attending.
It's a year-long contract. I can't eat that money.
I just don't have it.
Well, I don't understand.
So you're saying I can't, what,
I can't have a job here?
Dr. Robbins, you're back.
Now that is the reaction I was hoping for.
Uh, excuse me, Dr. Robbins.
So, Karev, tell me about this new peds guy.
You're married. You married that guy.
So? You got married.
To the woman I love. You don't even know this guy.
Look, the man needed insurance.
You know, can we not talk about this please?
Not ever or not right now?
Uh, I'm thinking not ever.
Hey, what's going on?
A major Seattle-area shooting...
We have reports that a gunman has opened fire on students and faculty.
Bailey?
Bailey, fill us in.
Again, that's at Pacific College.
We now take you live to our on-scene reporter.
Students and faculty are still in the building.
I'm trying to get some answers, but what we know so far
is that a gunman opened fire at Pacific College
and that there are at least a dozen -- I'm sorry?
Okay. Okay. There are at least 20 victims.
I'm sorry. You can't be here. Clear the area, please.
Clear it, please.
He's bleeding out from this chest wound.
Pulse is thready, and he's bled through the dressing.
We're going priority one.
V-tach on the monitor. Any pulse with that?
No pulse. Starting C.P.R.
Let's get him to the hospital.
You need to crack his chest. You need to...
Someone crack his chest.
There are 15 ambulances on the way.
Maybe more to come.
First one is three minutes out.
People...
People...our own trauma is fresh,
and we are going to have feelings today,
and there is no shame in that.
What I want to say is,
what we went through six months ago,
they are going through right now,
which makes them our brothers and sisters...
which makes them fellow travelers,
which makes them our own.
So to the very best of our ability,
we are gonna do our work first.
And you're gonna have your feelings later.
Grey.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Go to the pit, make sure we're stocked.
Call the blood bank -- - I'm fine.
Call the blood bank.
Tell them to give us all the O neg they have.
I got a cop. Michael Fazioli.
28. G.S.W to the right upper arm and left leg.
Okay, this one's mine.
All right, I'm on that one.
Chief Webber.
Sarge?
All right, Kepner, get him to Trauma One.
Do labs, trauma series,
and x-ray this leg and arm.
Okay.
This is the cop that took down the shooter.
You're kidding.
Yeah, he was on the radio.
He told me he landed a shot,
and then he went down.
I have conflicting reports
about what the shooter looked like,
so if you could wake Faz up, get him talking?
Faz?
Mike Fazioli. He's a good kid, great cop.
One of ours.
What do you have?
Professor John Sturgeon, 48,
fell out a fourth-story window,
has an open skull fracture and a blown pupil.
He fell?
He helped a dozen kids out the window and up on to the roof,
then he tried to go himself and slipped.
He's herniating. Get him to the front of the line.
Get him to the O.R.
You okay?
Nothing about this is okay.
Two and three are open!
15 year old, Kelly Keck, G.S.Ws to the leg and abdomen.
Abdomen rigid, systolic 75, last pulse 147.
She's 15?
Yeah. Look what being a genius gets you.
Clear Trauma Three and page Stark.
Right away, doctor.
Jared Swork, 20 years old, single entrance wound
to the left fifth intercostal space.
No exit wound. Lost vitals in front of us.
This is the emergency thoracotomy we called in about.
You did a thoracotomy in the field?
No, I didn't.
I had to crack his chest.
Cristina -- - Can you feel the lesion?
Yes, he's got a big hole in his right ventricle,
but as long as I keep my hand here,
I can feel a good heartbeat.
Cristina.
What? What?
You're going to the O.R.?
She's got her hand on the hole, Owen.
I'll be fine. I'll be okay.
Bring him to two.
This artery is in pieces. Vascular clamp.
Here you go.
Your best move is to amputate that leg.
You've got no more time to waste down there.
What? What?
The artery's blown. The femur is shattered.
Torres can fix that.
I'm more concerned about her life than her leg.
And I'm sure her parents will be, too.
Look, this kid is 15. You can save this leg.
You can't just cut it off.
What I can't do is
to spend any more time arguing with you.
Would you maintain pressure there?
Prep the damn leg, Karev.
Freakin' do something!
Intracranial pressure's getting higher.
Are we doing a craniectomy or a craniotomy?
Craniectomy is our best bet.
Dr. Shepherd.
Yes.
The professor's wife just arrived.
Can someone speak to her?
I'll go. I'll be quick.
Yeah.
You paged me?
Yang?
She was at the scene.
Oh, I was at the scene.
He's got a tear on the right ventricle.
And there could be torrential bleeding once we get in,
so I just, uh, just wanted a little backup,
just a little extra backup.
She's not sure if I can handle it.
I'm ready. I'm in. I'll go-- I'll go scrub.
All right. Let's get this boy on bypass.
Mrs. Sturgeon.
Yes, hi.
Hi.
Are you John's doctor? Is he okay?
He fell from a fourth-story window and landed on his head,
so we're taking him to surgery right now.
Wait, wait. Surgery?
We will be removing the left side of his skull
to give his brain room to swell.
Okay, I-I want to come with you.
I-I w--I w--I need to come with you...
because John doesn't like hospitals.
You can't come into the O.R.
No, no, no.
See, John is afraid of doctors, okay?
So I have to be with him. Please let me be with him.
Mrs. Sturgeon, I'm so sorry,
But you can't come in to the O.R.
I will come out and update you every chance I get, though. Okay?
Just, uh, excuse me.
Yes.
Hi. Would you sit with Mrs. Sturgeon?
This is gonna be a long day,
and you all need to take care of each other. Okay?
Okay.
You can put in a shunt and then do a graft.
Do you even have privileges here anymore?
Whether I have privileges or not isn't the point.
Karev's right.
Karev is not on this case anymore.
Dr. Stark, please, just take the time to do the graft,
and you can save her leg.
I know very well what can and can't be done,
Dr. Robbins. I have bigger fish to fry,
and this was very unprofessional of you.
I am all done engaging with it.
All right. Get the hell out of my O.R., Karev.
I'm sorry. I am unprofessional? I'm unprofess--I--
Body block him, Karev.
Don't let him near that leg.
Ah, he's got some blood in his chest, but the bullet's not there.
It's not in his leg or in his arm. Kepner.
Um... Uh, we should put in a chest tube
and get more studies to see what kind of damage we're dealing with.
Is there any chance we can wake him up
while we're waiting for the studies?
We could reverse his pain meds,
but it would be a pretty traumatic awakening.
He'd be in a lot of pain.
Chief, I'm getting all sorts of conflicting reports
as to what the shooter looks like.
You know, kids, uh, in shock, they don't remember,
but cops are trained to remember.
I don't know if there's a second shooter,
if this is some kind of plot,
but until I have a positive I.D., I've got nothing.
Believe me, Faz would rather feel some pain
if he can I.D. The shooter for me.
Okay, I'll reverse the meds.
Okay.
Kepner. Let's set up the chest tube.
Chief Webber, this guy you replaced me with
is a study in incompetence.
Not now, Robbins.
No, no, yes, now, because Dr. Incompetence is about to
hack off a perfectly good leg.
Robbins, I'm pretty busy here. What do you want me to do?
Give me privileges.
It's all hands on deck.
Of course you have privileges.
Okay. Thank you.
It's not an easy day to be the man in charge.
Torres! O.R. 2 right now. 9-1-1!
What? Where are you going?
I need scrubs.
Uh...
Okay, Bailey, can you take over for me here?
Oh. Okay, excuse me.
This is, uh, Chuck Fowler. He's 21 years old.
Zone two injury of the neck, secondary to graze G.S.W.
He has a hematoma and a C.T. Angio's been ordered.
Thank you.
Okay.
How you doing, Chuck?
Who walks into a classroom with an automatic weapon?
Who does that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Okay, here I go.
I'm a wrestler, man. I'm all-state.
Saw or no saw, you're not getting past me.
Karev, you want to tell me what's going on here?
He's lost his mind. That's what's going on here.
He's lost his mind, and he is destroying his career.
That is what is going on here!
Check it out, Torres.
15 year old, G.S.W. to the thigh with comminuted femur fracture.
Laceration to the superficial femoral artery. Ha!
All right. What about her nerves? Are her nerves salvageable?
Kid was moving her leg before we put her under.
They're intact.
She has a life-threatening hemorrhage in her leg
and multi-organ injuries in her abdomen.
Abdominal bleeding is under control for now.
Thanks so much, Dave. I appreciate the support there.
Well, I can put in a traction pin to stabilize the femur.
Right?
And then we can use a graft to restore blood flow.
That's what I'm saying.
I have never experienced anything like this before in my life!
Dr. Stark, you're new here, but in this hospital,
We take shootings personally,
and I can save this leg.
So are you gonna work with me or not?
No, no, I am. Dr. Stark,
I've just spoken with Chief Webber.
This is my patient now.
What?!
This is... Th-th-th-- this...
Yes!
Karev, you gotta go, too.
The pit's full of kids that need doctors,
and we can handle this one without you, okay?
That's cool. My work is done.
Ha! All-state, baby!
You see that bridging vein?
You'll have to compromise it
if you're gonna pull the skull flap back.
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go update the wife again.
Dr. Grey, you're a surgeon, not a social worker.
You can't spare me for five minutes?
And you have a patient open on the table.
Well, that's not the whole story.
Don't start this again.
Well, the other part of the story
is that he's got a wife who's panicking in the waiting room-- -
All right, fine. Go.
Just let me concentrate.
I'll be quick.
All right. He's ready.
Look, I'm gonna push the naloxone.
He's gonna wake up and he's gonna hurt.
So talk quick, okay?
Ready.
Faz, it's Marty.
Can you hear me?
Oh, God. It hurts.
Aah! Oh, God!
Faz, I need you to describe the shooter.
Can you do that for me, bud?
Chief Webber.
Did you really approve of Robbins storming my O.R.,
stealing my patient, humiliating me publicly?
There are plenty of patients to go around, Dr. Stark.
Jump in and find one.
I will not.
What I will do is to go back to my patient in my O.R.--
Go be a damn doctor!
People are dying. Now go save a life, right now!
Just hang on.
I need the info.
Okay, I understand.
Excuse me...
Dr. Hunt. I'm free. Do you need me?
I'm free. Dr. Hunt.
They just found another classroom full of victims.
We're getting at least a dozen more.
Crap.
And we're out of O.R.s.
What?
We're out of O.R.s, we're out of space,
and all the other hospitals are at capacity.
If any--any of them need surgery, we're...
We're screwed.
Dr. Altman,
You have a G.S.W. to the chest?
Dr. Yang.
Dr. Yang was on the scene.
She performed an emergency thoracotomy in the field.
You all right, Dr. Yang?
Yes, sir. I'm staying, if that's okay.
Uh, Dr. Yang, can you tell me what your patient was wearing,
and where his clothes are?
Uh, they were cut off at the scene.
It was, um, a green hoodie, jeans.
Is he a redhead, about 20?
Yes.
Uh, why, sir?
Send me down any bullet fragments you pull out of his body.
Chief, what's going on?
Your patient's the shooter.
Send down any bullets immediately.
They're evidence.
Okay, um...
Okay. Where were we?
You were about to reconstruct the ventricle.
Right. Right. Thank you. Okay.
Hand me 3-0 ethibond, please.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but I can't, Dr. Altman.
You can't hand me the ethibond?
I can't.
She can't save this guy...
is what she's saying.
He just shot up dozens of people,
and this surgery is gonna take all day.
Dr. Avery.
That's taking three doctors and four nurses away
from helping other people,
people who didn't shoot up
a campus full of innocent kids--
Dr. Avery.
I operated on Iraqi soldiers
who blew up dozens of our guys.
I didn't like it, but I did it,
because I'm a doctor, and I took an oath.
You're not a jury or a judge.
If there's a life to be saved,
we save that life, regardless--
I'm not doing this.
No.
Anyone else?
I'm sorry.
Dr. Yang...
are you staying?
Yes.
All right.
Okay, great.
Uh, 3-0 ethibond, please.
Oh, come on, come on. Press on the cricoid more.
I can't see the cords. Come on, Faz. Stay with me.
Kepner.
His vitals started dropping.
X-rays were clear, no bullet, so I did an ultrasound.
Found blood in the belly.
Okay, we need all available surgical equipment.
Okay.
All right? Quickly.
Good.
Ready for transport.
Uh, Chief. You should stay in that trauma room.
There are no O.R.s. Get the chief an anesthesiologist.
Right away, doctor.
What? I-I got a cop with blood in his belly,
The same cop that took down the shooter.
You're saying I have to operate on him in a trauma room?
I'm saying, it's your best option right now.
Sir, his pressure's dropping.
Hunt. I hope you know what you're doing, Hunt.
Yes, sir. So do I.
Kepner, lock him down in there
and get me a major procedures tray now.
Okay.
Avery, is Altman done yet?
Hurry, hurry.
No, and while we've got a cop bleeding out down here.
She's occupying a perfectly good O.R.
going to extreme measures to save the damn shooter.
I tried talking to her.
Wait. Altman's guy is the shooter?
D-does Cristina know that?
Yeah. So does Altman. I walked out.
All right. Go to the Emergency Room. There is incoming.
Kepner, I need you to go to outpatient recovery.
I need to get these supplies to the chief.
No, no, no, no, no. Hey, you. Take this to the chief
in Trauma One.
Okay, doctor.
Go to Outpatient Recovery
right now and oversee it.
What--what am I doing?
It's like a mobile trauma unit. It's like a mash unit.
I'll be there in a moment.
Wait, wait. Where are you going?
You were trained for this, Kepner. Oversee it.
Okay, coming through.
I understand why you're mad at me. I do.
No.
I even understand you slamming the door in my face, but--
No. No, you will not hold me hostage
and make me listen to you.
I am rebuilding the leg of a kid who's been shot.
That's--that's why I'm here. That is the only reason.
No talking.
None.
Okay, if anyone's free, we have an incoming patient.
G.S.W. to the flank with active hemorrhage.
Why are we still accepting critical cases?
I'm coming, Kepner.
Thank you.
Uh, look, continue to debride out
the devitalized tissue and repair the injured vessel.
You're serious?
What, you want to take
the incoming G.S.W.to the flank?
All right, then. Just, uh, there's enough surgeons around
if you have questions. Just take care of Chuck.
Okay, Chuck.
I'm gonna be doing a vascular repair on you
in a freakin' mosh pit.
Oh, son of a bitch.
I.C.P.'s still 45.
His brain is still swelling.
We're gonna have to remove the other side.
You're gonna take off both sides of his skull?
We're gonna leave this strip here
that covers the upper superior sagittal sinus.
Let's get the other side prepped.
Well, I'm gonna go update the wife.
Since when are you so interested in updating the wife
in the waiting room than doing this?
Since I was the wife in the waiting room, Derek.
I mean, honestly, do you think you and Cristina
are the only two who have ever been through a trauma?
Stop. Don't do that. Do not bring Cristina back into this.
You don't get to act like a spoiled little brat in my O.R.
Why is it okay for Cristina to do whatever she wants,
but it's not okay for me.
Because I'm not hiding under O.R. tables
or bartending?
Meredith.
I mean, honestly,
you and Cristina are so busy supporting each other,
have you even noticed that I went through a trauma, too?
I was the wife in the waiting room, Derek.
And it's so hard to be the wife in the waiting room.
So hard that I walked into the O.R.
while the shooter had a gun to you
and told him to shoot me instead.
That's how hard it is to be the wife in the waiting room.
Excuse me. I'm gonna go update my patient.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Okay, let's continue on.
Dr. Shepherd is going to remove
the other half of your husband's skull.
If all goes well in the O.R.,
he'll then freeze the skull to keep the bones from dying,
and then he'll sew the scalp and the muscle back
over the exposed brain.
Look, I don't understand. I'm sorry. I don't understand.
I know it sounds frightening and extreme.
And it is.
But Dr. Shepherd is very good.
And I'll--I'll come out and keep you posted, okay?
Okay. Okay.
I'm looking for the Sackett family.
Anybody here for a John Sackett?
Excuse me. Is anyone here related to Jared Swork?
Yes. That's my son.
How is he? Is he okay?
Ma'am, would you mind coming with me?
My son was shot. He wasn't the shooter.
No. No!
My son didn't do this!
No, no, no.
What the hell?
Sloan, move on.
I'm gonna kick your ass.
Kick it later.
We've got a kid in three with a G.S.W. to the shoulder,
and we need this space for incoming.
Fine, but my name's not going on this chart.
That's a hack job you did.
Somebody get Dr. Nelson here. Now.
I'll get Grey. You get Bed Three.
Clean it and wrap it.
Right away, doctor.
She's got an intracranial hemorrhage.
Uh, her pupil just blew.
She needs burr holes and a--and a trauma flap.
We gotta evacuate that clot.
Okay, we can do that. We can do that.
I need some hands over here, Avery.
Yep.
Arterial repair. Can you hold that?
Got it.
You know, Altman's still in O.R. 1?
So you can't choose who you save.
Yeah, that's apparently the party line.
The shooter's sick.
Nobody does this in their right mind.
What's your point?
My brother just had a psychotic break
and tried to kill my sister. And if he got hurt,
even if he got hurt hurting people,
I would want his doctors
to do everything they could to save him.
No matter what he did, he's still my little brother.
Making the incision.
Ready with the drill?
Yeah.
No. You're gonna do it.
Mark.
She's your patient, Dr. Grey.
You're gonna save her life.
Ready?
Gently.
Right there.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Damn it. He's crashing.
I need a crash cart in here now.
Hey, do not die, Chuck.
You hear me? That shooter does not get to win this.
You come back.
Here goes.
Clear.
Come on.
Come back... Right now, Charles.
Come back to your body right now.
Clear.
You bastard! You better send this boy back right now!
Clear!
Sorry about the bastard thing.
There's something you need to see.
*Alma mater, to you*
*We'll be loyal and true*
*And we shall bring honor and pain*
*Our home in our memories*
*We now give to you*
*For we love and we cherish*
*your name*
*Throughout all the years, sweet Pacific Northwest.*
What is that?
The Pacific College alma mater.
Thank you for staying today, Christina.
I know it can't have been an easy decision.
Know what, though?
It was.
How is he?
Well, he's decompressed,
but he's got a bad contusion.
Damn it. He's bleeding too much.
Vascular clips.
She's... right there.
Mrs. Sturgeon.
Yeah. I'm Dr. Shepherd.
Uh, your husband is in a medically induced coma.
He'll have to stay that way until his brain heals.
And hopefully, in a couple of weeks,
we'll be able to replace the skull and wake him up.
Wait. You're saying that he lived?
That he's alive?
Uh, we have a l--
long road ahead of us,
but, yes, he is alive,
and I can take you to him if you'd like.
Oh, thank you. Oh, my God.
It's okay. You can see him in a few minutes, all right?
He made it? I told you. I knew it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Uh, has anyone talked to you about your son?
The police questioned me for hours,
as if I should've known something.
They found a...
suicide note in his jeans.
And I-I didn't know anything.
My whole life...
Everything... I ever knew is a lie.
He's my baby.
All I want to know is if he's alive.
Is that terrible?
All these people he hurt...
Does that make me a terrible person?
Your son...
was shot in the chest.
Dr. Altman, who's a very good heart surgeon,
is doing everything that she can.
She's still in surgery, which means he's still alive.
And she'll come find you as soon as she's out.
Thank you.
He's fine.
Oh, God. Oh, my God. You're kidding me.
No. It was touch and go for a while,
but he's gonna be fine.
And, um...
let's stop meeting like this, Marty.
Oh, please, God.
Please, God.
This is-- this is a huge victory.
You know, whatever else happened today,
we worked together well, so... thank you.
Thank you for coming when I asked you to come
and for fighting Stark with me.
Calliope.
I am...
so deeply, deeply,
deeply sorry
for hurting you so much.
I am so sorry,
because I am so in love with you,
and I will spend the rest of my life telling you that.
I'll apologize to you every day if that's what you need.
But please...
please don't walk away again.
I came across the world to be with you.
I love you.
Please.
You had to fly across the world to get to me, Arizona,
because you flew a whole world away
without ever looking back. You just left.
And this might be news to you--
you know, I-I think it kind of is--
But you're not the only one in this relationship.
There are two of us.
And you came back today, but I didn't.
Whatever else happened, that--that...
that hasn't changed.
Oh, you...
You've been holding everybody up
even though...
You amaze me.
I know you're mad at me for taking Cristina fishing.
And I know you think it didn't work.
I just heard she's O.R. 1.
What?
She's here.
I just took my kid to a room.
He was the last one.
Besides this one.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Besides this one.
37 degrees.
Should be any minute now.
We saw 26 patients.
26 victims...
and we had no casualties.
No one died.
I hate this place.
Surgery is extreme.
We cut into your body, take out pieces,
and put what's left back together.
I was holding a grudge.
I can hire you back.
But you're gonna have to work under Stark.
She's, uh, still sedated.
And she's just a kid.
She shouldn't have a big ugly scar.
Uh, do you mind waiting?
I'll be about another hour.
I love you.
So...
Yeah, just, uh...
Take your time.
I, um... I'll wait.
Good thing life doesn't come with a scalpel,
because if it did...
when things started to hurt,
We would just cut and cut and cut.
Hey. I'm-- I'm really sorry I'm late.
You look exhausted.
You look exhausted.
I look handsome.
How about we get you some insurance?
Let's have a drink first to toast the day.
Henry--
Because I've never been married. Have you?
No.
Um... bt I wouldn't say that this is exactly a--
I know what this is. But I say we raise a glass anyway.
Look, there was no ring, right,
no vows, no photographer,
no wedding cake, which I was most disappointed by,
because I love wedding cake.
I think we can at least have a toast, right?
I spent the day in the O.R. saving someone
who really, really is, um...
not a very good person.
Well, you saved me, too.
You saved my life this morning,
and that deserves a toast,
even if it wasn't a real wedding.
Okay.
Okay.
The thing is,
what we take away with a scalpel...
we can't ever get back.
You want to get a drink?
Yeah, I do.
Maybe not a real drink, actually,
because I'm trying to get pregnant,
and supposedly, alcohol will make my baby have three heads
and 16 toes.
Want to get some crack cocaine?
So like I said...
