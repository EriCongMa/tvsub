no , no , no , no , no .
did you forget ? !
oh , shoot .
maura , this crack @-@ of @-@ dawn run was your idea !
damnit , i could have slept in !
i &apos;m so sorry .
hey , babe , once you touch it , you got to do something with it .
babe ?
what is tommy doing here so early ?
it &apos;s not early so much as late .
he spent the night .
playing chess ? he &apos;s quite good
sorry .
knight to b3
mm . declining the gambit . risky move
morning sis .
i didn &apos;t realize you two were so chummy .
oh , this isn &apos;t chummy
i &apos;ve all but destroyed his king &apos;s pawn defense .
whatever
good for you .
mom goes to atlantic city for a few days ,
and now you &apos;re sleeping over ?
like she said , jane ,
we &apos;re just playing chess .
best opponent i ever faced .
stop .
rizzoli
yeah , okay , i &apos;ll be right there
come on , we got a possible homicide . we got to go .
i &apos;m about to castle .
and i ... i haven &apos;t been called in yet .
dr. isles .
no moves without me
no moves at all .
show yourself out .
do not sleep with my brother .
what ? !
jane , it hadn &apos;t even occurred to me .
although he does have exquisite long bones .
&quot; long bones &quot; ? eww !
femur , tibia .
look , it &apos;s his mind that i find myself most attracted to .
he barely graduated high school .
well , bobby fischer was a high @-@ school dropout ,
and he &apos;s a world chess champion .
well , okay , so when tommy becomes a world @-@ class chess champion ,
you can sleep with him .
really ?
no .
neighborhood thieves stripped this baby clean last night .
didn &apos;t get around to calling us about all the blood in it
till an hour ago .
what , they steal the victim , too ?
all we know is that there was one .
well , it &apos;s a good place to dump a car
if you &apos;re gonna kill somebody in it .
two distinct patterns of arterial spray .
both the victim &apos;s carotids were severed .
whoever sat here is most certainly dead .
without a body , we &apos;re gonna need as much evidence as we can get .
uh , hey , officer , spread the word that bpd will pay triple
what any pawn shop or fence will pay
for anything stripped off this car -- no questions asked .
okay .
and , uh , anything that gets turned in ,
homicide gets it first .
it &apos;s duncan , by the way .
what ?
my name -- officer ronald duncan .
did i say something wrong ?
people just like to be acknowledged , jane .
which reminds me --
no .
jane ?
sensitivity training is mandatory for the entire department ,
and it &apos;s incumbent on me to make sure that you attend .
look , i don &apos;t want to pull rank .
i &apos;m in the middle of a homicide investigation .
i don &apos;t have time to go sit with some emo @-@ nazi
and have her tell me what i can or cannot say
to all the lowlifes and scumbags
and gangbangers that i got to deal with .
nice .
uh , car belongs to a melissa joy black from michigan .
22 years old .
called ann arbor pd -- no stolen @-@ car report .
they checked her phone there -- disconnected .
yeah , well , it &apos;s &apos; cause she lives in boston now .
that &apos;s a current parking pass at the local terminal .
my guess is ...
melissa joy works at the docks .
secretary in one of the offices , maybe ?
well , now , that &apos;s a very sexist remark
coming from a guy who &apos;s pitching sensitivity training .
she &apos;s 5 &apos; 2 &quot; working at the docks .
how &apos;s that sexist ?
because a mesomorphic woman of that height
could easily lift two times her
body weight , detective korsak .
frost , e @-@ mail this to me ?
hey , you want to process the crime scene ?
i &apos;m gonna go to the docks .
see ya .
you , of course , are coming with me .
well , you know , i &apos;m beginning to think
that you are deliberately trying to take me
away from my chess game .
yes , maura , i am sabotaging your knight @-@ to @-@ queen castle
thingy move .
i drove you here .
hey , babe . nice tits .
oh , yeah , we &apos;ve been waiting for you all our lives .
what &apos;s he think we &apos;re gonna do ?
just run over there and tear off his clothes ?
he &apos;s not thinking consciously at all .
it &apos;s a natural chemical response to our pheromones .
really ?
&quot; nice tits &quot; ss a natural chemical response ?
perceived fertility is paramount .
males seek mates capable of nursing offspring .
abundant breasts do suggest --
yeah , you know what his abundant belly suggests ?
snowball &apos;s chance in hell .
here -- the office is over here .
oh , hey , excuse me .
can you tell me who &apos;s in charge here ?
uh ... he &apos;s busy .
so am i.
boston homicide .
hey , what can i do for you lovely ladies ?
that &apos;s a doctor . i &apos;m a detective .
and you are ... ?
ray murphy .
i &apos;m the union rep around here .
is there a problem ?
are you familiar with this employee ?
melissa joy black ?
well , i can tell you she &apos;s not one of the office girls .
it appears every female here is over the age of 18 .
could she be a longshoreman ?
i guess she could be one of the casual workers ,
but we don &apos;t have many gi-- girls .
um , let me have you talk to one of the union bosses .
axl !
this detective needs to talk to you .
you &apos;re a cop . that &apos;s a turnoff .
bummer . do you recognize her ?
m.j. yeah .
she walked off the job halfway through her shift yesterday .
affirmative @-@ action hires are bullshit .
no muscle , no use .
actually , male and female muscle tissue is identical .
what varies is the size of the male skeletal frame .
men generally have less body fat .
but not always .
what &apos;s going on ?
call 911 !
need some help ! call 911 !
tide started going out when one of the guys noticed her .
it &apos;s melissa joy black .
is that --
it &apos;s an ice pick , jane .
doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s back .
yes , it does .
paddy doyle &apos;s signature --
ice pick through the heart with a message attached .
i guess he didn &apos;t like e @-@ mail .
what kind of message is he sending , though , with the murder
of a 22 @-@ year @-@ old female dockworker ?
whatever it is , i won &apos;t be the one forensically interpreting it .
i &apos;m calling in dr. pike from the western mass office .
oh , no , anybody but him .
don &apos;t know what &apos;s worse --
his pompous attitude or his o.c.d.
that &apos;s very insensitive language , sergeant korsak .
i &apos;m sure language like that
would really hurt dr . pike &apos;s feelings .
come on , maura .
you don &apos;t have to do this . all right ?
the only people who know about your connection to doyle
are us and frost .
we may finally be able to prosecute paddy doyle for murder .
i don &apos;t want to risk a defense attorney finding out
that he &apos;s my biological father
and using it against us in court .
what are you gonna tell pike ?
we don &apos;t have to tell him anything . i &apos;m his boss .
oh , my god .
bill sutton , mass shore chief executive officer .
is there some way ...
her body can be covered ?
it &apos;s , uh -- it &apos;s pretty upsetting .
you say you &apos;re with mass shore ?
yes , our company runs the docks .
some people say the mob still does .
well , uh , i know there &apos;s a long history of that down here .
ever since we took over last fall ,
we &apos;ve taken steps to change that .
don &apos;t think paddy doyle &apos;s taken too kindly to that .
you don &apos;t think he had anything to do with this , do you ?
a dockworker is tied to the piling
with an ice pick sticking out of her chest
for everybody here to see ?
yeah , we think there may be a connection .
mr. sutton , have you or anybody at your company
received any graft demands
or extortion threats since you took over ?
no .
our corporation doesn &apos;t have any ties to the mob .
they do .
and by &quot; they &quot; you mean the dockworkers .
look , like every company ,
we &apos;ve had our troubles with the union .
you &apos;re probably not gonna get a lot of help out of those guys ,
but we &apos;ll do everything we can .
sooner we can rid the docks of this element , the better .
all right , well ,
you can start by getting us all your surveillance video footage --
any place you got a camera .
you got it .
he &apos;s right , you know . longshoremen won &apos;t talk .
it goes against their code .
remember that line from &quot; on the waterfront &quot; ?
&quot; i don &apos;t know nothin &apos; .
i ain &apos;t seen nothin &apos; . i ain &apos;t sayin &apos; nothin &apos; . &quot;
here &apos;s the deal .
i &apos;ll do sensitivity training , you don &apos;t do brando .
could he be more anal ?
actually , yes .
although he exhibits many of the classic freudian traits --
rigidity , fixation on rules and orderliness --
his autopsy work is less than meticulous .
when will you be starting ?
momentarily .
seems not much stock is put
in the proper placement of instruments here .
you gonna let him talk to you like that ?
this is ridiculous .
you &apos;re his boss .
is there something particular you require , doctor ?
yes . organization .
now , we have a well @-@ developed female caucasian ,
22 years old ,
with an incised gaping wound across the neck .
later that same day ...
i do miss this .
not many near decapitations
in the hinterlands of western massachusetts .
the ice pick is a nice touch , though unnecessary --
she bled out in under a minute .
that doyle really is a butcher , isn &apos;t he ?
will you excuse me ?
don &apos;t let that idiot get to you .
well , i can &apos;t fault him for telling the truth .
paddy doyle is a butcher .
paddy doyle has nothing to do with you .
he fathered me .
he ... simply provided the sperm .
all right ?
and judging by the amazing person that you turned out to be ,
his dna didn &apos;t win .
i don &apos;t understand the strategy behind this attack .
well , that &apos;s simple . i mean ,
doyle is just trying to scare the hell out of anybody
that won &apos;t do his bidding at the docks .
no . i @-@ i meant tommy &apos;s decision to move his rook to b5 .
wait a minute . my little brother
is im &apos;ing you at the office and sending you little smiley faces ,
and there &apos;s nothing going on between you two ?
well , you and i keep in touch throughout the day .
it must be my amazing long bones .
what --
i hope you can forgive me for my invasion of your personal space .
allow me to introduce myself so we can dialogue .
my name is carol madigan .
sensitivity training liaison .
dr. maura isles .
how may i help you ?
i &apos;m looking for detective rizzoli ,
who i &apos;m told is here , although she &apos;s scheduled
to be in my &quot; connect , protect , and respect &quot; class .
you seen her ?
i believe she is in the building .
um , but ... i don &apos;t see her right now .
tell her i &apos;m looking for her .
where &apos;s jane ?
you sicced that sensitivity freak on me ?
&quot; freak &quot; ? maybe you do need sensitivity training .
got the victim , melissa &apos;s address .
you gonna hide , or you want to come with me ?
how &apos;d you get it ?
melissa had to file a dockworker &apos;s card
with homeland security -- they had a local address .
great work , sergeant detective korsak .
i think that we should investigate ,
but what do you think ?
we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
it &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve ever been glad
my father &apos;s not aware of anything .
i wouldn &apos;t know how to tell him about my sister .
and can we ask what he &apos;s suffering from ?
a head injury .
doctors say he probably won &apos;t come back from it .
he was hurt six months ago . he &apos;s a longshoreman .
can you think of anyone
who might have wanted to harm your sister ?
you ever heard of paddy doyle ?
everybody in southie has . why ?
any issues between your father and doyle ?
your dad ever mention him coming around the docks
or the union hall ?
never .
did she ever mention doyle &apos;s name in the last few months ?
no . melissa &apos;s a college student .
actually , she went by her initials , m.j. , at the docks .
what ? nobody called her that .
why was she at the docks ?
she was working as a casual there .
last place she was seen alive .
i can &apos;t believe she did this .
did what , shannon ?
the union said our dad &apos;s accident was his fault
because he &apos;d been drinking on the job .
melissa wouldn &apos;t believe it .
she ... was gonna find out the truth for herself .
dr. isles ?
yes .
i discovered in the victim &apos;s stomach contents
a micro sd card .
it &apos;s from a camera .
video , my guess .
must have swallowed it just before she was killed ,
and i &apos;ll bet paddy doyle wanted it .
that sounds very much like an assumption .
you think there &apos;s a drug deal on it ?
a murder .
i don &apos;t ... know .
nor is it within our purview to guess .
please take this up to detective frost in homicide .
arguably the most important find
against a notorious mobster ,
and i &apos;ll be credited with it ,
all because you needed help .
funny , huh ?
good night , doctor .
please don &apos;t sit in my chair .
i &apos;m very intrigued by the assertiveness of your play .
just giving what i &apos;m getting .
and what does that tell you ?
what the hell ? !
wait -- tommy , don &apos;t !
he needs a doctor -- now !
my god , that &apos;s paddy doyle .
i know who he is .
the bullet seems to have fractured your clavicle .
you &apos;re lucky .
thought your idea of luck
would have been if it had pierced my heart .
the bone prevented the bullet from hitting a major artery .
been through this before . just need stitching up .
it &apos;s not that simple .
you have tissue damage , vasculature concerns ,
bone fragments .
do it ...
or he dies .
i &apos;ll need his help .
please ask the guy with the gun to stop pointing it at him .
tommy , find me some towels ,
bowls , um , hot water .
i &apos;ll need to irrigate the wound before i can suture .
that your boyfriend ?
you &apos;re holding me hostage .
you think you have any right to ask me personal questions ?
the exit wound is quite large .
it &apos;s gonna be difficult to close .
i don &apos;t have anesthetic .
don &apos;t need any .
what happened ? how did you get shot ?
business .
was the woman murdered at the docks
&quot; business , &quot; too ?
not mine .
i didn &apos;t kill her .
how the hell do you know this guy anyway ?
i &apos;m her father .
sutton sent over all the dock surveillance footage .
found melissa leaving .
so she did leave in the middle of her shift .
i wonder why .
no idea . but no one follows her .
well , it &apos;s not like doyle &apos;s the type
to show up on surveillance footage .
anything on the sd card ?
still trying .
stomach acid did a number on it .
i don &apos;t have any audio , but look at this .
i only got a few frames .
someone &apos;s chasing her .
yeah , paddy doyle .
oh , we just need one frame of that bastard &apos;s face .
oh , yay . officer helpful &apos;s back .
hey , uh , yeah . thanks for bringing that up .
um , a battery probably isn &apos;t going to
help with the investigation ,
so you can just take that down to evidence .
it &apos;s not in the job description
to bust my balls for homicide .
why doesn &apos;t he have to take sensitivity training ?
he already did .
works wonders .
did some checking on richie black .
before he wound up on a ventilator ,
he was pretty much a dockworking stiff .
no criminal record , not a single tie to doyle .
no , he works the docks ,
paddy owns the docks --
there &apos;s your connection .
i also got a copy of his osha accident report .
lab from the e.r. said his
blood alcohol was .10 .
guess he was drinking on the job .
yeah , but melissa didn &apos;t believe he did it .
she went undercover to prove it .
maybe she stumbled across something she wasn &apos;t supposed to .
that alone &apos;s enough to get her killed .
weapons , drugs ,
human trafficking -- it all goes through the docks .
we got to get one of those dockworkers to talk .
i just wish we didn &apos;t have to wait till tomorrow .
we don &apos;t . high tide &apos;s at 2 : 01 .
they &apos;ll all be there .
how do you know so much about it ?
i had an uncle who was a stevedore .
i flirted with it in my younger days .
decided it wasn &apos;t a good fit .
i like my fingers and toes .
so you could have been a longshoreman .
more than that . i coulda been a contender .
stop .
instead of a bum , which is what i am !
you all right ?
fine .
so , what are you , adopted or something ?
yes .
how long did you know you were related to him ?
not long .
bishop to d7 captures the rook .
check .
it &apos;s okay .
we don &apos;t need to talk about it .
help him .
help him !
like this ?
you want him to die , dude ?
shut up !
stop !
now fix him !
he really should be on an i.v.
his body is working to replace fluids and white cells .
you look a lot like your mother .
who was my mother ?
you would like her .
she would like you .
did she love you ?
she did .
but you would still like her .
we can &apos;t possibly talk to all these jimokes .
pick a target .
oh @-@ ho , look who &apos;s back .
baby , i guess you want some of this .
oh , get your hands off your junk !
this detective &apos;s a lady .
what ?
thank you , kind sir , for defending my honor .
no , i merely defended an individual
who happens to be female from an inappropriate harasser
who happens to be male .
speaking of which ,
why don &apos;t you try to get through to the gorillas
and i &apos;ll talk to her .
hey . boston homicide .
can i ask you a couple questions about m.j. black ?
i don &apos;t know anything .
even if i did ,
union rep told us not to talk .
whose hand is this ?
because i found it on my ass .
got one more where that came from .
do you ?
yes .
here &apos;s what i got .
hey , let go ! freakin &apos; lezzie .
what the hell happened ? ! what ? he grabbed my ass .
this scumbag had the nerve to put his filthy hands on you ?
just one .
that &apos;s all i need to take you in ,
you dumb son of a bitch .
come on .
rizzoli .
yeah , okay .
we got another dead body .
it &apos;s paddy doyle &apos;s right @-@ hand man .
kevin brennan .
he and paddy got kicked out of grammar school together .
they &apos;ve been partners in crime ever since .
multiple g.s.ws.
maybe they had a falling out .
i don &apos;t see an ice pick .
how many shell casings are there ?
they &apos;re still counting them .
why ?
this just -- it feels like an ambush
more than an execution . you know ?
this guy spends 50 years attached to paddy &apos;s hip ,
and then winds up dead ?
i don &apos;t think brennan was the target .
and , either his blood
got on paddy &apos;s shoes ,
or paddy took a bullet himself .
i &apos;ll have csru check the blood trail .
see if there &apos;s more than one type .
so we talking mob war ?
yeah , maybe , for control of the docks .
ohh , what the hell is pike doing here ?
detectives .
where &apos;s dr. isles ?
i have no idea ,
nor do i understand your question &apos;s relevance
given our nearly identical credentials .
just tell us what you &apos;re doing here .
dr. isles was unreachable .
frost .
yeah , i got it . go .
it &apos;s discrimination , pure and simple .
the governor felt he needed to appoint a &quot; woman . &quot;
once again , i &apos;m penalized for being a white male .
don &apos;t even .
that &apos;s probably jane .
let it go .
why did you even come here ?
you could have paid off any number of doctors for treatment .
but they wouldn &apos;t have been you .
that &apos;s supposed to warm my heart ?
because it doesn &apos;t .
i &apos;ve seen what you &apos;re capable of .
i saw what you did to that young woman !
i didn &apos;t do anything to her .
i don &apos;t kill women or children
or anyone who doesn &apos;t deserve it .
oh , so even you have standards ?
regardless of what you think of me , maura ,
in my world , i &apos;m a man of honor ...
and of my word .
i &apos;m being framed .
i don &apos;t believe you .
you &apos;re the chief medical examiner . use your science .
it &apos;ll tell you if i &apos;m guilty or not .
where are you going ?
to finish what someone else started .
jane .
where is he ? where &apos;s doyle ?
gone . 15 minutes ago .
paddy was shot , right ?
a bullet fractured his clavicle .
he lost a lot of blood ,
but the injuries weren &apos;t life @-@ threatening .
how &apos;d you know ?
well , because i just came from a crime scene
where his top lieutenant wasn &apos;t so lucky .
do you know what happened ?
no , but for paddy doyle to take a bullet ,
somebody he trusted must have given him up .
god , it looks like an e.r. in here .
maura had to fix him at gunpoint !
he told me that the shooting was over business .
so , what ?
so melissa &apos;s murder was under the category of pleasure ?
no , he denied the killing .
he said somebody was trying to frame him .
that he doesn &apos;t kill women or children or innocents .
of course he told you that , maura .
he &apos;s not gonna confess to the one person in the world
that he gives a damn about .
a mob boss like paddy doyle
couldn &apos;t rule the streets this long just on fear .
he lives by a code . that &apos;s why he has respect .
are you finished ?
he has a heart , jane .
i &apos;m serious ! you didn &apos;t see the way he looked at her .
he may be a bad guy , but he loves his daughter .
all of his victims were gangsters -- no women , no children .
that we know of .
no forensic evidence links paddy to any of these killings .
none of his dna was recovered from melissa , either .
he &apos;s good .
yeah , that &apos;s part of his legend .
he may go down for racketeering or tax evasion like capone ,
but murder ? no way .
he isn &apos;t usually this messy .
you think he &apos;s slipping ?
he told maura he was being framed .
nobody &apos;s stupid enough or suicidal enough
to frame him for murder .
yeah , but it would be brilliant
if somebody could pull it off .
you know , murder melissa ,
make it look like doyle did the deed -- case closed .
hey , frost , you get any audio off that sd card yet ?
no .
oh , whiz kid &apos;s finally met his match --
a half @-@ digested sd card .
hey , if you want to try ...
oh , god .
can somebody please sign for this ?
and torture the poor guy ?
he &apos;s here for you , jane .
no , he &apos;s not .
oh , yes , he is .
this guy hates me . i &apos;ll show you .
on your desk , rizzoli ?
uh , no . i @-@ i &apos;ll take it , but thank you ...
very much ...
officer duncan . thanks .
actually , this is kind of heavy .
i could take it down to evidence for you if you want .
that &apos;s okay . no , it --
no , it &apos;s okay . i got it . it &apos;s okay .
i got it ! thank you .
thank you .
see ?
love .
stop .
love .
shut up .
all right , what do we have in here ?
we got a stereo , a cd player ,
some wires .
an amplifier .
oh , yeah , that looks modified .
check it out , frost .
axl &apos;s time in lockup is almost up .
hopefully it &apos;s put him in a mood to talk .
dr. pike .
i &apos;ve ... looked through your report
on melissa joy black .
i didn &apos;t see a reference
to an examination of the victim &apos;s teeth or gums .
cause of death was quite clear , as is my report .
i didn &apos;t feel the need to floss her molars .
specifically , i am concerned about the post @-@ mortem bruising
around the victim &apos;s mouth , here and here .
hmm . which i noted on page 27 .
but , uh , it suggests
that the perpetrator applied force against the victim &apos;s mouth
during the attack .
and what &apos;s your point ?
detective rizzoli &apos;s investigation indicated
that this was a very brave young woman
going undercover on her own .
i don &apos;t make my rulings based on a victim &apos;s personality traits .
well , neither -- neither do i.
but i would consider that such a woman
may have bitten her killer .
i want to see the body .
already released to the funeral home
per her family &apos;s request .
without my approval ?
i &apos;m a medical examiner , too .
no , you are an assistant medical examiner .
you work for me , dr. pike .
it figures that someone like you would try and pull rank .
i went to harvard , you know that ?
shut it !
or i will assign you to a town
that will make western mass feel like paris .
you have one hour to get that body back , understand ?
yes , doctor .
was there any talk about m.j. ,
anybody following her around ?
i ain &apos;t saying nothin &apos; .
especially to no dumb bitch .
hey ! show some respect , piece of crap !
nice moobs .
moobs ?
yeah , man boobs .
your little grab ass at the docks --
that &apos;s indecent assault and battery on a police officer .
you &apos;re looking at 7.1 / 2 years .
you got 30 seconds
before we officially press charges .
remember melissa black .
she was murdered , and we think you know why .
no , man . i barely knew the broad .
you sure as hell knew her father , richie black , didn &apos;t you ?
you serious ?
she was his kid ?
10 seconds .
5 seconds .
richie was a stand @-@ up guy .
he wasn &apos;t afraid to roll up his sleeves like the rest of us .
he had my vote .
he was running to be your union rep ?
yeah .
safety on the docks been going to hell ,
and richie was the only one taking it on .
it looked like he was gonna win when he had his accident .
who was his competition ?
it &apos;s the guy who won -- ray .
maybe paddy had something to do with richie &apos;s &quot; accident . &quot;
paddy and ray would be good pals .
look at ray &apos;s rap sheet .
assault , fraud .
put his 6 @-@ year @-@ old on the union payroll .
poor richie . that &apos;s not a guy to run against .
melissa must have thought that paddy and richie
had something to do with her father &apos;s accident .
so she spies on ray to prove it .
you have any footage of ray the day that melissa left early ?
yeah . here .
looks like ray left mid @-@ shift , too .
just a few minutes before melissa did .
go to the dock parking @-@ lot camera .
ray &apos;s got nice wheels .
no way can that guy afford an amg on a longshoreman &apos;s salary .
pull up the footage of when melissa left .
there she is .
yeah .
leaving right behind him .
so she wasn &apos;t being followed .
no , she was following ray .
ray &apos;s wife says he &apos;s at the docks today .
why ? they don &apos;t work when the tide &apos;s low .
you ever shake hands with the guy ?
it &apos;s like a marshmallow . ray doesn &apos;t work much at all .
hey , there !
miss madigan . sensitivity trainer .
i was gonna call you .
and tell me that she failed to complete her training ...
again ?
you can just forget about winning that extra &quot; c &quot; day ,
sergeant detective korsak .
that &apos;s why you &apos;ve been all over this ?
so you can get an extra day off ?
i also happen to feel very strongly about the teaching of tolerance .
really ? because i just got out of a half @-@ hour meeting
with mr. dwyer , who &apos;s lodging a formal complaint
about the abusive treatment he received while in custody .
did you tell mr. dwyer he had moobs ?
yes . yes , i did .
and i am completely ashamed by the cruelty of my words .
it was inappropriate and unkind
and insensitive .
no charges will be filed , mr. dwyer ,
and i do hope that you can accept my sincerest apologies .
i @-@ i guess so .
i @-@ i do have every intention
of finishing my sensitivity training , asap .
thank you , detective .
uh , now , if you &apos;ll excuse us ,
we are in pursuit of a suspect .
oh , of course .
take care .
quite a performance .
incredibly sensitive , don &apos;t you think ?
you &apos;re lucky they hadn &apos;t begun the embalming process yet .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re not doing this yourself .
because it &apos;s your case , dr. pike .
i &apos;m not overriding it , i &apos;m ... expanding upon it .
isn &apos;t that a fine euphemism
for insulting my professionalism .
this isn &apos;t personal , dr. pike .
it certainly feels that way to me .
i &apos;d focus on the maxillary central incisors ,
as well as the canines .
i &apos;m not seeing anything at all .
she has a bit of an underbite .
check the mandibulars , as well .
i think i found a particle .
it appears to be skin .
after analysis ,
add this as an addendum to your original autopsy report .
i don &apos;t need your pity . this was your find .
but your autopsy . you take the credit .
i insist .
thank you .
boston police ! open up !
he &apos;s not whimpering .
not anymore .
you okay ?
no , it was horrible .
oh , my god ! poor ray ! oh , my god !
do you remember anything ? anything you saw or you heard ?
i just heard screaming . i just heard screaming .
looks like he was tortured first .
two of his fingers are broken .
yeah , and eight of them aren &apos;t , so he must have talked .
the question is , who &apos;d he give up ?
or what ?
did you get the dna results back on the skin yet ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
the dna results .
on the skin particle that you found on melissa &apos;s teeth .
do you have them ?
it &apos;s too soon to tell .
but i &apos;m fairly certain
that i know who melissa &apos;s killer is ,
even without them .
yeah , well , me too , but ...
it was a rush to judgment , jane ,
but science is unbiased .
the impression made by this bite
matches melissa &apos;s dental records .
so the dna results are a formality at this point .
this man killed melissa .
ray ?
paddy doyle was telling the truth .
paddy doyle runs those docks . all right ?
ray just could have been following orders --
your father &apos;s .
it &apos;s frost . he says he has something big
that we both need to see .
what did you find ?
melissa hid this behind her cd player .
it &apos;s not an amplifier . it &apos;s a wireless receiver .
so she was uploading everything she recorded .
backing it up wirelessly .
she was also recording onto the sd card she swallowed .
frost , tell me there &apos;s footage .
there is .
40 years the fed &apos;s been trying to
get paddy and his gang on tape .
think a 22 @-@ year @-@ old girl got the job done ?
she &apos;s following ray .
the forensic evidence proves that he killed her .
yeah , but it doesn &apos;t prove that paddy wasn &apos;t behind it .
ray &apos;s meeting somebody .
that &apos;s a clear shot of ray .
okay , now we just need one of paddy .
frost , can you blow him up ?
i can try .
get it done . you screw this up ...
can you do anything to the audio ?
i &apos;m not paying you for nothing , okay ?
you push them faster .
i don &apos;t give a damn about safety regulations . all right ?
that &apos;s not his voice .
is that sutton ?
yeah , looks like ray ditched the old mob for the new mob ,
the corporation .
but it &apos;s the same racket .
faster the dockworkers unload ,
the more ships they can get in , the more money they make .
hey ! what are you doing in here ? ! get her !
it was sutton . paddy was telling the truth .
he didn &apos;t order melissa &apos;s death .
i &apos;m thinking ray gave up sutton before he died .
then you &apos;d better find sutton before my father does .
stand back .
sutton &apos;s office is on the sixth floor .
elevator .
please help .
where &apos;s doyle ?
i don &apos;t know !
frost , the stairs !
i got it .
is there any other way out of this place ?
he told me i was gonna die slow .
he &apos;s right .
you will , in jail for the rest of your miserable life .
it &apos;s a private elevator . damn it !
damn , he &apos;s getting away again .
he &apos;s gone .
at least we got our bad guy .
yeah , one of them .
i &apos;ll put out a bolo .
hey , ma . how was your trip ?
oh , i lost 85 bucks on the nickel slots .
but look at all these really great stuff i got .
hey ! anybody need a robe ?
ma ... did you take this from the little fridge ?
they refill it , jane .
this isn &apos;t free , ma .
they &apos;re gonna charge your credit card .
i paid $ 109 a night for that room .
really ? i &apos;m gonna send it back .
four hours of sensitivity training ,
and i passed with flying colors .
congratulations .
did you learn anything ?
yes . i am an equal @-@ opportunity offender .
okay , are they gonna charge me for this ?
hello ?
detective rizzoli .
how did you get this number ?
i &apos;m one of the good guys compared to this new way
of doing business .
i know you know that .
i &apos;m not sure i do . where are you ?
you know i &apos;m not telling you .
well , that &apos;s too bad .
why don &apos;t you tell me about melissa joy black ?
back when i ran the docks , we didn &apos;t kill women ...
or hurt hardworking people like her father , richie .
well , that was ruled an accident .
yeah .
check the dna on the blood alcohol test
they said was richie &apos;s .
take care of my daughter .
i can take care of myself .
hang up .
i do think he loves you .
it doesn &apos;t mean i have to love him back .
what happened to the door ? !
tommy forgot his keys .
tommy , you know better than that .
i make a suggestion ?
checkmate .
what -- you know how to play chess ?
yeah , who do you think taught him ?
