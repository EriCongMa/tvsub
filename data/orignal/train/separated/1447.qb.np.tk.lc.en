第三季 第十四集
oh , i hope tad likes salmon .
it &apos;s a bit of a risk serving fish
to a first @-@ time diner at dunphy &apos;s .
maybe i should marinate a steak for backup .
i think someone has a man crush .
first of all , i would never date a potential client .
that &apos;s &quot; first of all &quot; ?
secondly , i really need this to go well
so he makes me his realtor . this guy &apos;s flipping properties
like they &apos;re extras in a kung fu movie .
so you &apos;re just kissing up to this guy for his money ?
not just . i really like him .
he travels the world doing charity work ,
rock climbs , flies planes ...
how does he have time to do all that ?
got divorced , and his whole life opened up .
guy &apos;s living the dream .
his dream .
not my dream . i &apos;m living my dream .
you &apos;re my dream .
you can stop .
i so don &apos;t want to do this .
recently , haley got a little creative
on one of her college applications
and listed herself as a &quot; big sister . &quot;
technically , i am a big sister .
she capitalized the &quot; b &quot; and the &quot; s. &quot;
which makes sense , &apos; cause it was .
so claire and i suggested--
forced .
that she volunteer for the organization .
we couldn &apos;t be prouder .
we could .
little bit .
hey , dad ?
did you accidentally leave this hilarious book
of lawyer jokes in the guest room ?
i &apos;ll tell you if you can answer the following question--
what &apos;s the difference between
a catfish and a lawyer ?
i don &apos;t know . what ?
well , one &apos;s a bottom @-@ feeding mud @-@ dweller .
the other &apos;s a fish .
zing !
honk !
okay , everyone , dinner is served !
let &apos;s get it !
our house is being fumigated , so jay and gloria
invited us to stay here for a few days .
i am very excited to have 72 hours with this one .
we don &apos;t get to spend much time together ,
so i know that we &apos;re gonna be like , um ...
fred and ginger ?
who ?
movie night !
it &apos;s nosier than usual around here .
oh , gosh !
tad , this wine is fantastic .
spend a week in mendoza ,
and you &apos;ll find a dozen or so malbec producers
that &apos;ll give most bordeaux a real run for their money .
mm . i &apos;m sorry .
this should come with a warning--
&quot; may cause pretentiousness . &quot;
you should come with a warning-- &quot; may be fascinating . &quot;
oh ! excuse me .
oh , gosh !
oh , that &apos;s , like , the ninth time this screw has popped out .
oh , you know what ? i need the angled screwdriver .
i left it at the office .
i , um , i keep it there because of--of all my signs .
i &apos;ll , uh , put up a &quot; for sale &quot; sign ,
and next day , of course ,
i gotta put up the &quot; sold &quot; banner .
yeah .
then the next day , same deal-- &quot; for sale &quot;
&quot; sold . &quot;
&quot; for sale . &quot; &quot; sold . &quot; &quot; for sale . &quot; &quot; sold . &quot;
you &apos;re a great-- great salesman .
i &apos;m getting that . - &quot; for sale . &quot; &quot; sold . &quot;
right . listen , i @-@ i @-@ i gotta go relieve the babysitter .
my ex @-@ wife took 50 % of my stuff
and left me 100 % of my kids .
they &apos;re great . hey , listen , um ,
thank you so much for coming .
oh , no , thank you , phil , so much
for the salmon and the steak
and the chicken and the shrimp .
i mean , it was all just delicious .
oh , great .
this guy is very lucky to have you .
okay . thanks .
yeah .
all right .
let me grab that .
yeah .
yeah . thanks so much . bye @-@ bye .
bye @-@ bye .
did you see that ?
a handshake that almost became a hug ?
yeah , i saw it . i lived it . i think i &apos;m in .
no , honey . he kissed me on the lips .
another good sign !
it &apos;s not a good sign .
sweetie , you don &apos;t think that &apos;s weird ?
well , the guy &apos;s a world traveler .
he has a time share in costa rica .
that &apos;s probably how they do it there .
i don &apos;t know , honey . it felt like he lingered .
it &apos;s a progressive culture .
most of them travel by zip line .
biscuits and gravy ?
yep , my grandma bitsy &apos;s secret recipe ,
given to her by her housekeeper delilah ,
who raised her and was her best friend--
kind of like &quot; the help , &quot; except delilah was white ,
and was actually herself quite the racist .
eat up .
good morning !
hi , mom .
hi , sweetheart .
ah , where did those come from ?
yeah , i thought amaryllis were out of season .
oh , i got a guy . you know , i just thought
they &apos;d brighten up the house a little bit .
oh , that was so thoughtful of you .
i didn &apos;t realize that my house needed brightening up .
there she is !
gloria ! gloria !
ay ! let me fix your hair !
oh . well , isn &apos;t that sweet ?
i didn &apos;t realize her hair was broken .
ah ! that smells delicious ,
but nothing for me . i &apos;ve got an early work lunch .
really ? i didn &apos;t hear an ambulance .
原意为律师追着救护车里的伤者 要求帮忙打官司 &#93;
yeah , it &apos;s funny because it &apos;s what i &apos;ve dedicated my life to .
oh , is this that meeting with the deejay with the funny name ?
booker bell .
booker bell .
booker bell ?
everybody now !
booker bell was only the greatest deejay
in the history of drive time radio .
yeah , well , now he has some wetlands that developers want ,
and we &apos;re trying to get him to donate for preservation .
when i was on the road selling ,
i used to listen to booker all the time .
he practically invented the prank phone call .
okay . wish me luck .
good luck , sweetie !
booker would play a prank ,
the sucker would be twisting in the wind ,
and just when you couldn &apos;t stand it anymore ,
he &apos;d say , &quot; guess who just got their bell rung ! &quot;
god , i &apos;d love to meet him .
oh , they &apos;re just going down to rae &apos;s .
you should pop down .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;d love to meet a fan .
i don &apos;t know .
i met boz scaggs once , got all tongue @-@ tied .
oh , you &apos;ll be fine .
oh ! oh , lily , it &apos;s time for school , sweetie .
oh , i can take her .
oh . that &apos;d be great .
yeah , it &apos;d give me some more time to clean the kitchen .
maybe do a little dusting .
delicious , cam .
annie was amazing , so funny and cute and sweet .
yeah , you &apos;ve said .
she made this for me last night .
look how she signs her name with that big loopy &quot; a. &quot;
i &apos;m totally going to frame this .
i made this for haley four years ago .
you think this got framed ?
she tossed it in the garbage ...
right after she wrote &quot; mrs. haley jonas brothers &quot;
on it , like , 30 times .
the tax write @-@ off alone makes financial sense .
you know , even if you take the environment out of it .
well , don &apos;t take the environment out of it .
without the wetlands , there &apos;s no ducks ,
and without the ducks , there &apos;s nothing for me to shoot at .
okay . well , we &apos;re shooting from two different angles ,
but , uh , hopefully we &apos;ll end up at the same place .
mitch .
dad ?
i just had to stop down and meet this guy .
booker bell , i &apos;m boz scaggs--
no ! i mean jay pritchett . damn it .
it &apos;s nice to meet you .
this is such an honor .
you are hands down my favorite radio personality of all time .
that &apos;s kind of you to say .
okay . well , thanks for stopping by , dad .
you know , i gotta tell you one thing .
i &apos;ll see you back at the house .
one time when i was driving from youngstown to sugar creek ,
you called this guy at a kitty litter company
and you asked him to bring over 900 pounds of litter ,
and in the background , you hear all these lions roaring , and ...
i @-@ i laughed so hard , i almost had an cicident .
the car or you ?
funny as ever !
anyway ...
hey , are you still in touch ... with the old gang ?
grandma groovy ? spaceman clyde ?
are you kidding ? i am the old gang .
no way .
i may be old , but i still know how to boogie .
my god , it &apos;s like she &apos;s here !
she is here !
how are you still not getting this ?
that &apos;s her .
excuse me for a sec .
what are you doing ?
what ? i &apos;m a fan . i came down to say hi .
this is a business meeting .
do you have any idea how inappropriate this is ?
no . no , of course you don &apos;t ,
because as far as you &apos;re concerned , all a lawyer does
is walk into a bar with a rabbi and a polar bear .
白熊比喻意图勾搭律师的女性 &#93;
grizzly , &apos; cause otherwise , when the bartender--
dad ! i &apos;m working !
you &apos;re embarrassing both of us !
please , you gotta go !
all right . i didn &apos;t realize that .
yeah . yeah . you didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry . go .
hey . where &apos;s my stalker ?
oh , he &apos;s gone . i got rid of him .
sorry that he attacked you like that .
attacked ?
no . i don &apos;t mind a little smoke up my bombers .
well , i just thought since this was supposed a business meeting .
we should ...
and you thought maybe having somebody make me feel good would
wreck it ?
there &apos;s--there &apos;s been a lot of tension between me and my dad .
i &apos;m actually staying at his house and it &apos;s just a ...
oh , so you chased away a man who &apos;s opened his home to you ?
i get the sense that i &apos;m losing you .
could i talk to grandma groovy ?
honey , i &apos;m home !
well , i didn &apos;t expect you so early , dear .
what ? you ?
yeah . look who came by to fix the table .
well , i had some time to kill ,
so i thought i &apos;d drop by with that tool your wife needed .
wow . what a guy .
yeah .
he also brought some wine .
well , you said you liked it last night ,
so i had a couple extra bottles lying around .
boy , do you know the way to this gal &apos;s heart .
i didn &apos;t just come here to fix your table
and get your wife drunk .
i actually decided to give you
that listing on the sycamore property .
really ? that &apos;s great .
yeah . why don &apos;t you , uh , come over for dinner tonight ?
and , uh , we &apos;ll work out all the details . one entree .
claire , you should come , too .
oh , no , no . no , no , if it &apos;s business--
i insist .
he insists . we &apos;ll be there . we &apos;re coming .
okay .
yeah , shall we say , uh , 7 : 00 ?
7 : 00 sounds great .
okay .
all right .
i &apos;ll let myself out .
okay .
wow .
&quot; wow &quot; is right .
i just got sycamore--
a house that sells itself and gives me the commission .
how does that not bother you ?
claire , it &apos;s an expression .
there &apos;s work . inspections , appraisals--
he brought me wine ,
he took his shirt off when you weren &apos;t here !
um , he brought us wine ,
and it doesn &apos;t look super vacuumed down there .
i &apos;m surprised he kept his pants on .
okay . okay , i can see what &apos;s going on .
you--you &apos;re just so focused on getting his business ,
that you don &apos;t see what &apos;s going on in front of you .
okay . now i do see what &apos;s going on .
what ?
come here , pretty girl .
what ? mm ?
you are , you know . you don &apos;t hear it enough .
the other night , when you put on makeup ,
i was like , &quot; there she is . &quot;
oh , my god .
you think i &apos;m making this up as some part of a @-@ an ego boost ?
do you realize how insulting that is ?
what are you doing ?
helping my little sister with her homework .
that seems ... mean .
annie , this is alex .
that other sister i was telling you about .
hi . so nice to meet you .
um , if you &apos;re going to study there ,
you might need to correct numbers 7 through 10 .
this bed has higher standards than that bed .
i &apos;m going to get some more lemonade .
i think your sister &apos;s mad at our sister .
we &apos;re back !
oh , well , there you are . i guess &quot; lunch then home &quot;
means different things to different people .
we had a girls &apos; day . lily , lily , come !
show your papa what we bought !
matchy jackets !
it &apos;s like she &apos;s the baby leopard ,
and i &apos;m the mama .
or they just happened to have two jackets ,
one large , one small .
what happened here ? where is my tea ?
oh , it &apos;s in this drawer over here .
as a thank @-@ you ,
i took some time to rearrange your kitchen
so it makes sense .
to who ?
to everyone . there &apos;s a flow now . watch--
tea . mug . kettle . you &apos;re welcome .
i didn &apos;t thank you .
you don &apos;t have to .
i won &apos;t .
cam , our shared bathroom is not the place
to work out whatever &apos;s going on here .
i &apos;m a child of divorce .
conflict resolution is something of a specialty .
the key is , tell a personal story
that applies to their situation ,
even if you have to make one up .
that way , they really hear what they need to hear .
i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re right .
no . i &apos;m sorry i snapped .
i &apos;m just going through some stuff
with this girl i like , danielle .
she came over the other day , and stella was all over her ,
and--and i got jealous .
which is crazy , right ?
i mean , stella was only playing with her because she was new .
manny , sounds like danielle was trying
to get between you and your puppy ,
and that ain &apos;t cool .
she seems immature , and you can do better .
i &apos;m sorry to be blunt ,
but i &apos;m going through something myself right now .
so , chin up . okay .
it may not work every time ,
but you only need one fish to bite .
who is this danielle ?
she &apos;s my study partner in my history class ,
and we share a notebook .
but her notes were really confusing ,
so i put them in order .
instead of thanking me for making our lives easier ,
she got all mad because she thought i was judging her .
this girl is very bad news , manny .
you stay away from her .
we &apos;re phil and claire .
hey , i &apos;m tony .
come on in . i &apos;ll go get my dad .
okay .
great , thanks .
i don &apos;t like the way that kid was looking at you .
we are not friends right now .
i am only here to help pump up the college fund .
claire , if tad even makes a move towards you ,
his ass is ... grass .
really ? i thought that was just my ego .
so far , yeah , but just know ,
i &apos;m ready to grass his ass .
hey , hey , hey , guys .
hey ! how are you !
good .
good to see you .
yeah .
hi . that &apos;s good .
well , i love the place . did you remodel this ?
uh , actually , my ex @-@ wife .
she had a , uh , passion for modern architecture
and at least one modern architect .
may have to sell this one next .
really ?
i love how open it is .
do you mind if i , uh , poke around ?
please , yeah .
beautiful .
tad , if you don &apos;t need my help anymore with the kids ,
i &apos;ll be going .
thank you so much , ellen .
you &apos;re welcome .
okay . we &apos;ll see you later . bye .
i saw this house eight years ago .
there used to be a wall here , right ?
that &apos;s right . that &apos;s right . that was all covered .
yeah.i &apos;m a detail guy . hard to get much past me .
hello , hello !
hi , aunt kara !
how are you ?
good , tad , how you doing ?
bye , daddy .
bye , sweetie .
bye , dad .
have fun .
okay . see you later .
come on , guys , let &apos;s go .
these stairs used to be teak , am i right ?
this guy &apos;s good .
yeah , he &apos;s good .
he &apos;s sharp .
i forgot my bag .
you do that every time .
yep .
i don &apos;t miss much .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . were you trying to read ?
you &apos;re the one who tries to read .
oh , my gosh ! i am not that stupid !
seriously , haley , you think you
are the coolest person ever !
would you please stop
just judging me and everything that i do ?
&quot; look at me ! i &apos;m so cool ! &quot;
enough ! enough !
i am so sick of you two fighting all the time !
you &apos;re a bad big sister ,
and you &apos;re a bad little sister !
and you &apos;re both bad big sisters to me .
be normaler .
i &apos;ve never seen him like that .
well , we do kind of neglect him .
and if you think about it ,
he is kind of ... our little sister .
remember how we used to dress him up ?
i miss her .
i hear you ,
and i don &apos;t like where this is going !
you get the lipstick ,
i &apos;ll get the bra and tennis balls .
betty luke !
欲知笑点 务必查证图片 &#93;
i will burn this house down !
where is the cheese grater ?
where is the cutting board ?
where would you want it to be ?
yes , right here next to the cheese grater .
i know it &apos;s hard to tell by looking at me ,
but i am not a natural homemaker .
so when cam came and organized my kitchen ,
i felt insecure and lashed out .
in a way , i &apos;m no better
than manny &apos;s crazy friend danielle .
please , can we just focus on the cooking ?
daddy , we forgot to give you this .
it &apos;s like our jackets .
i love it .
i guess i &apos;ve always been a little sensitive
about lily not having a mother ,
and gloria &apos;s so good at it .
i got jealous .
maybe i should tell manny this story .
it might help him with that train wreck danielle .
you know what ? why don &apos;t you turn that music back on .
was kind of nice .
hey , dad ...
no need to talk about it .
i was out of line coming down there ,
won &apos;t happen again . scotch is at the bar .
no , i &apos;ve been giving this a lot of thought .
i guess we &apos;re gonna talk about it .
i was rude to you .
i think i was just annoyed by all the lawyer jokes .
i mean , let &apos;s be honest , you don &apos;t exactly
beam with pride over what i do for a living .
mockery is the sincerest form of flattery .
pretty sure that &apos;s-- that &apos;s not the saying ,
but , um , you know , manny told me a story
about his friend danielle .
she sounds like a real piece of work , by the way .
but , uh , it made me realize that
i take myself a little too seriously .
listen , it goes without saying i &apos;ve always been proud of you ,
and i brag about you all the time .
so if i say , &quot; what do lawyers use as birth control ? &quot;
and the answer is , &quot; their personalities , &quot;
i want you to know i &apos;m not referring to you .
you don &apos;t need any birth control .
hello ?
yeah , this is jay pritchett .
what ? when ?
what happened ?
it &apos;s the police . my car got stolen .
yeah , 2012 . gray .
no , not pewter . more like a light ...
like a--no , not slate .
i don &apos;t even know what &quot; coastal fog &quot; is .
just put down &quot; gray . &quot;
kilo ?
it &apos;s not my car .
yes , she &apos;s columbian .
what does that have to do with--no , i &apos;m coming down there .
hang on . grab your keys .
i think i might need a lawyer .
guess who just got his bell rung ?
that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s good .
here we go . have a seat .
i got a bottle of port from 1899 .
okay , i got it for $ 18.99 ...
but it &apos;s a good one .
fun night , right ? great dinner ?
yes . yes , and ...
tad is ... great ,
and i know i was giving you a hard time ...
but i feel like i should say that i am sorry .
hey , hey , hey , claire , you don &apos;t need to explain .
your apology is apology enough .
oh , i forgot the best part
of the costa rica story .
so we get home , and they &apos;ve taken over the living room ,
they &apos;ve taken over the kitchen ,
i mean , they &apos;re in the food , they &apos;re on the bed .
and finally , after two years of complaining to diego about this ,
he finally stops and says ,
&quot; okay , now i see it .
you do have a monkey problem . &quot;
a monkey problem !
yeah , i heard him the first time .
you can kiss my wife , you can take her to bed ,
but you cannot make her laugh .
i wanna go back .
you can kiss my wife ,
but only i can take her to bed and make her laugh .
i wanna go back .
only i can take my wife to bed ,
comma ,
and make her laugh .
i mean , they &apos;re in everything .
the only thing they didn &apos;t touch--
the bananas .
the monkeys love bananas !
you would think they would love the bananas .
yeah , we should go .
come on . the bananas--
yeah , we need to go .
we gotta get going .
oh , no , no , no .
yeah , yeah , we &apos;re late .
but he just opened the--
we &apos;re late for getting home .
thanks for everything . just--
what is wrong with you ?
you laughed like it was &quot; who &apos;s on first ? &quot;
what ?
he &apos;s on second . don &apos;t try to cheer me up .
i know what &apos;s going on here . you &apos;re jealous .
of him ?
he &apos;s not even funny !
what &apos;s he got ? like , a soft ten minutes ?
and he goes to the costa rican well
a little too much for my taste .
oh , god .
really ? this is still about the monkey ?
no ! no , no , no !
it &apos;s you . you are making me so happy right now .
you stormed out of there , and you &apos;re acting like an idiot .
you like this ? because i am really uncomfortable .
honey , i love it . makes me feel special .
sometimes , i really don &apos;t understand you .
i know . it &apos;s stupid ,
but it &apos;s nice to know that sometimes you &apos;ll fight for me ,
and all i have to do is laugh at some other guy &apos;s story .
but no one makes me laugh like you do .
as long as it &apos;s always genuine .
you can fake anything you want with me ,
but not your laugh .
i &apos;d like to go back .
yeah .
stop it ! leave me alone !
hold still !
stop moving !
i hate you ! get off of me !
what ... is going on ?
you guys are in a lot of trouble .
haley , i told you to clean this mess up ,
and , alex , your books are everywhere .
betty luke , sit down while your dad gets the camera .
got it .
last time , you made a funny face
and we didn &apos;t really get a good shot ,
so let &apos;s work on our smile .
