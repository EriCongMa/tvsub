Vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power.
Since then, werewolves can only turn on a full moon
and vampires are weakened by the sun.
You're saying that the oldest vampire in the history of time
is coming after me?
You want to find Klaus? Start with Isobel.
Elena's mother.
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
What kind of a deal?
I need you to stay put
and stop trying to get yourself killed.
Why are you helping me?
I don't want you to be alone.
A bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire,
so don't be his friend.
Do you understand me?
What are you doing here?
I miss you.
Hey. I'm Jules.
I'm trying to track down Mason.
You should leave town.
Are you threatening me?
On a full moon.
It's healing.
Morning.
Everything all right here?
It was an animal.
A wolf. It came at us in the night.
Are you OK?
Yes.
But my friends!
They're all dead.
I'm calling it in.
Come in, dispatch.
Go ahead, Jerry.
Stefan?
Stefan?
You're standing right behind me, aren't you?
Yep.
Good morning.
I don't want us to be apart anymore.
Ever.
Me, neither. But...
Don't ruin the moment.
You're about to ruin the moment, aren't you?
I'm totally ruining the moment.
I can't just pretend like everything's OK.
Katherine's locked away in the tomb.
I know, but we still have this pressing little issue
of you being Klaus' human sacrifice.
Yes, but Elijah promised to keep me
and everyone else safe as long as we played by his rules.
Right. As long as you played by his rules.
Please don't go after Isobel.
Katherine said Isobel could have some answers,
and I just have a couple questions, that's all.
Stefan, I made a deal with Elijah.
Right. You made a deal with him.
I didn't make one.
You should keep your deal.
Stefan, I don't want anyone else to get hurt.
When have I ever wanted somebody to get hurt?
Vervain. I made it light,
but are you sure?
Just because Katherine built up a tolerance...
Yes.
Bottom's up.
You OK?
How can Elijah compel another vampire?
He's an original. I don't really know what that means.
I don't think anybody really knows what that means.
Except maybe Isobel.
And we should ask her.
I was born in 1450.
That makes me 560 years old.
If you were a bottle of wine...
So I can die.
I've lived long enough.
You know, if you're going to be maudlin,
I'm just going to kill you myself.
Just to put me out of your misery.
Come on, it's just a little werewolf bite.
Just a little fatal to a vampire werewolf bite.
Well, according to legend,
which is a notoriously unreliable source...
Drink up.
Blood heals.
It does feel like it's working.
Let's have a look. Come on.
Let me see.
How is it?
Definitely...Better.
Right, Elena?
It's not bad.
Where's Stefan?
He left. I need you to talk to him.
He's convinced that he has to find Isabel.
But I think that's going to upset Elijah.
No can do. I'm with stefan on this one.
But if you could play nurse
for a little while...
It's not necessary.
It is necessary. Elena's a do-gooder.
It's in her nature. She just can't resist.
Damon.
Is she going to die?
Probably.
The wolf bite caused some kind of infection.
It's getting worse.
Like poison?
I don't know, Elena.
I'm not an expert in the field.
I'm sorry.
Death happens.
We come, we go. Sooner she dies, the better.
It's gloomy as hell in here.
How you feeling?
I'm OK.
Sore. Every muscle aches.
You did it.
Your first full moon, and you didn't hurt anyone.
And it'll get easier.
You'll get better at it, you'll learn to control it,
and it won't hurt so much.
Well, we don't know any of that for sure.
No, but small victories, Tyler.
Last night was a victory.
You know, let's take it.
Look, I really want to thank you.
I don't know what I would have done
if you hadn't been there.
Yeah, anyway, um,
next month we should probably, uh,
reinforce the wall,
because it almost got me that one time,
and it just would have been...
What?
Never mind. It's--
Wait, no, hey.
No, what-- what is it?
Well, it's not a big thing.
It's just that one bite,
curtains for me.
What are you talking about?
The legend says that
a bite from a werewolf
can kill a vampire.
How do you know that?
I think I read it somewhere.
Hey, Caroline. Do you have a second?
Uh, yeah, sure.
I'll see you guys later.
That was nothing, OK? There is nothing
going on between Tyler and I.
We were just talking--
I believe you.
Hey, look, Caroline,
you're a lot of things but you're not a liar.
You've always been straight with me. I believe you.
Well...Good.
And that's why I want to be straight with you,
because I-- I think we got some wires crossed here.
And you know how tongue-tied I get,
and, well, I don't like this.
Whatever this is that's going on between us,
I just want to--
Hey. You can't--
What? Just...
But Caroline--
No, Matt, OK?
Sheriff Forbes.
Hi. I'm Mason Lockwood's friend from Florida.
Jules, right?
Is there any news?
No one's heard from him.
I've opened an investigation.
As soon I hear anything, I'll let you know.
Hey, Damon.
The, uh, wolf is at the Grill.
Thank you.
Ah, is that the-- wow.
Yeah, yeah.
I just left Damon a message.
So you're doing his dirty work for him now.
Well, she could have a cure for Rose.
I couldn't find anything in Isobel's research.
Except that it's fatal.
Do you still know of a way
to get in touch with Isobel?
Even if I did, she isn't going to help.
Katherine said that Isobel knew of Klaus.
So this isn't about Rose.
It's about Elena.
I have an old number.
Probably out of service.
No harm in giving it to me, then?
You know you can't trust Isobel.
Even when it comes to Elena.
I know that.
All right.
I'll see if I can find the number.
If I do, I'll text it to you.
I hate this.
I'm a vampire.
I haven't had a cold in 5 centuries.
Just get in bed.
We don't get sick. When we die,
It's fast and sudden.
And it's certainly not drawn out with an illness.
You're not going to die.
Such a human thing to say.
You've never been in Damon's room before, have you?
玛格丽特·米切尔
It's not what you expected?
It's just a room with a bed.
Maybe I expected there to be silk sheets.
You're lucky, you know.
No one's ever loved me the way you're loved.
I doubt that.
Trevor was my best friend. Nothing more.
I spent all those years on the run from Elijah.
I just never thought it was a good idea to set up roots.
The whole idea of a family is not exactly compatible with being a vampire.
Why are you so eager to give up?
I'm not giving up on anything. Here.
What do you call this whole deal with Elijah?
I call it my best option.
It's your easiest option.
That's not fair.
You really think that your witch friend
destroyed the moonstone?
I spoke with Bonnie.
I know that she had the help of another witch.
Assuming it's Elijah's witch,
so, no, I don't.
You really are determined to die, aren't you?
At least I ran.
You're not even trying.
I'm so tired.
No, stop, wait.
Tell him to prepare the horses.
It's ok, Rose. Just get some sleep.
You'll feel better when you wake up.
Trevor, don't be so stupid.
We're never going to make it there before the sun.
Oh, Elena.
Elena, I need more blood.
Yeah, of course, here.
Here.
Ok, you're all right.
It's all your fault, Katerina!
You, Katerina. You did this!
Elena! Rose, Rose, I'm Elena!
You traitor!
I'm not Katherine!
Elena?
Oh, my god.
It's me, it's Elena.
Oh, my god, Elena, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what's happening to me. I'm sorry.
You're going to be all right.
My mind, I'm...
It was just for a second.
I'm sorry. Don't be scared of me.
I'm not.
I'm not.
But... You need to rest.
I'm scared.
You're not alone. I'm right here.
Here, where's here?
Damon's bedroom. You're in Damon's bedroom.
I want to go home.
Tell me about it.
St. Austell.
30 kilometers south of London.
With fields and trees and horses.
Sounds beautiful.
When you live long enough, everything disappears.
So much time wasted. I just wish I hadn't been so afraid.
Isobel, it's Stefan Salvatore.
I, um, I need to speak with you.
It's about Elena.
Please know that it's important.
What are you doing here?
I've been waiting for you.
Listen, there's a lot of people here.
Well, damn. There goes
my plan to rip her spleen through her back.
Hey, listen. I know you're upset about Rose.
Why does everybody think I'm upset about Rose?
I'm fine. I don't know if you know this,
but sometimes vampires die.
I'm going to have a friendly chat
with ladywolf, brother. Ease up.
Hello?
Well.
It isn't the one I meant to kill.
I'll have to get that right next time.
You won't live to see another full moon.
Unless...
Unless you tell me how to cure a wolf bite.
And then I won't kill you.
Promise?
Yes.
Bite me.
I'm not afraid of you.
Then you are very, very stupid.
How's your friend? Rose.
Is that her name? Have the chills started?
The unbearable pain.
If there's a cure, tell me.
Or start watching your back.
Did I mention the dementia?
It'll eat away at her brain.
Soon she'll be rabid.
You want a cure?
I'll tell you the only cure that exists.
Take a stake and drive it through her heart.
I brought some clean sheets...
It's Elena.
I'm worried about Rose.
I think you should come home.
Rose?
Oh, my god.
Katerina.
No!
Rose, stop, stop, it's Elena.
I'm not Katherine.
You're hallucinating.
I'm not Katherine.
I'm not Katherine.
Elena? I know that it's you and not Katherine.
Elena, please. I need your help.
Caroline.
Why?
Why what?
I kissed you.
I know. I--I was there.
So why'd you run away?
You caught me off guard.
Yeah?
What did you expect me to do?
Not that.
Well, I'm sorry.
And...
And what?
What do you want me to say, Matt?
Something. Anything.
How did you feel?
Anything in the realm of truth right now would be nice.
Okay.
I feel...
Like I--
I love you.
I love you.
Then what's the problem?
What are you keeping from me, Carrie?
Look, if you love me, you'll tell me.
So what is it?
Hey, Matt! We need more burgers.
Yeah, not now, Dana.
Are you okay?
Where's Rose?
I don't know.
Excuse me.
Are you ok?
Hi.
Thanks for coming so quickly.
No, I was close by.
Liz, what happened?
A vampire. Luckily one of my deputies discovered the body
before anyone else saw him.
You have to secure the area, then.
Don't cause a panic,
but let's move this party into the cafeteria.
I'll the east side of the school, you go west?
Sure.
Hey, Stefan, it's me.
I don't know where you are, but please call me.
It's important.
Hey.
Have you heard from him? Do you know what he's up to?
Baby brother's not exactly my priority right now.
Take this.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, what was going on back there with the police?
Some maintenance man had a heart attack.
He just dropped dead.
Eddie?
Rose, stop!
Rose, Rose! It's me, Damon.
It's me.
It's Damon.
Did I do this?
No! I didn't mean to.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
I never wanted to hurt anybody.
I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
Come on, let's get you home.
No, I don't have a home.
I haven't had a home in so long!
Oh, make it stop! Please, make it stop!
Oh, make it stop!
Hi there.
I'm sorry.
You went on a murderous rampage.
It happens.
I'm sorry, Elena.
I don't like taking human life. I never have.
You shouldn't be here.
That's the worst part about death--the hunt.
The need to kill.
The thirst.
Pleasure it brings you afterwards.
I wasn't mean to be evil.
It hurts.
Well, then stop talking about it.
Damon's a lot like me.
He wants to care, but the minute he does,
He runs away from it.
I'm sorry for what I've done today.
I know.
And you need to fight.
I know that you're scared,
but you have to do it anyway.
Why are you so nice to me?
Us humans.
You can never forget it.
What it's like to be human.
It haunts me.
It's the only thing that's kept me going.
It doesn't hurt as much anymore.
What do we do?
Go.
Okay.
Damon
Just go. I've got this.
Oh, my god! Make it stop! Make it stop!
I can't take this anymore, make it stop!
Hey.
Where have you been?
Uh, school. What's up?
What do you want?
We need to talk.
Why?
What's wrong with you?
I just don't understand one thing.
What?
Why would you risk it?
If a werewolf bite kills a vampire...
Why would you risk it?
Because you needed help.
I could have killed you.
But you didn't.
Y--
I don't understand you, Caroline.
Why is it so hard for you to let someone else help you?
Well, that's not it.
Yeah, it is, Tyler.
It's like you--you don't want anyone to care about you.
And, I'm sorry, I care.
I care, Tyler,
so forgive me if I overstep my boundaries by actually giving a--
You can't do that.
I'm sorry. It's--
Everyone just needs to stop kissing me!
Who'd have thought you'd be a nice guy?
I'm not nice.
I'm mean. I like it.
You lie.
Shh, shh. Just sleep.
Just sleep.
This was my favorite place to come as a girl.
How did you know?
Word gets around.
You told Elena.
Am I dreaming?
The sun is so warm.
I miss this.
I miss being human.
Humanity's not all it's cracked up to be.
I had friends. I had a family.
I mattered.
You still do.
No.
But you do.
You built a life, whether you want to admit it or not.
I spent 500 years just existing.
You didn't have a choice.
You were running from Klaus.
There's always a choice.
You know, you are ruining our perfect day
with your strange philosophical babbling.
I'd like to enjoy the fresh air.
Will you enjoy it with me?
For a while.
Thank you.
For what?
The pain's gone.
I'm glad.
Will I see them again?
My family?
I think you will see whoever you want to see.
That would be nice.
Maybe I'll see Trevor, too.
I'm not afraid anymore.
I'll race you to the trees.
Well, you'll lose.
I'm older and faster.
Oh, you think?
Well, I'm compelling this dream, maybe I'll cheat.
On the count of three.
One...
Two...
Here's your vampire.
How did you find her?
Doesn't matter. What matters
is that it's over.
Thank you, Damon.
Once again, you've helped keep this town safe.
I'll take care of burying the body.
Thank you for coming.
So what do you want from me?
Just to be your friend.
Mason would have wanted that.
I know about Mason.
And you.
You know what?
I know you're a werewolf.
And I know your little friend Caroline is a vampire.
How do you know about Caroline?
You can't sniff them out?
Oh, my god.
You're brand new.
How many times have you turned?
Hey. I can help you.
Do you know where Mason is?
He's dead, Tyler.
He was murdered.
No.
You want to know who murdered him?
It--just stop.
Your little blonde vampire did.
No.
Caroline would never do that.
She and her little vampire friends were behind it, Tyler.
Caroline is the only vampire in town.
Is that what she told you? She lied.
This town is crawling with vampires.
But don't worry. We'll get them.
Who are you?
I'm your friend.
There are others like us, and they're on their way.
You were supposed to leave.
I did.
But then I came back to make sure that you're ok.
I appreciate the gesture.
I'm just glad it's over.
You know I don't believe that.
Go home, Elena.
Get some rest.
It's a whole new day tomorrow.
Damon, I'm your friend.
I'm well aware of that.
And a friend usually knows when their friend is hurting.
What do you want to hear?
That I cared about Rose? That I'm upset?
Well, I didn't, and I'm not.
There you go, pretending to turn it off, pretending not to feel.
Damon, you're so close. Don't give up.
I feel, Elena, ok?
And it sucks.
What sucks even more is that it was supposed to be me.
Jules was coming after me.
You feel guilty.
That would be human of me, wouldn't it, Elena?
And I'm not human.
You're one to talk about giving up.
It's all you've done, is give up.
Go home.
There's been enough doom and gloom and personal growth for one day.
Ok. I will.
Good night, Damon.
Stefan. You're home.
Rose?
I, uh, I called Isobel.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I had to.
It's ok.
Did you find her?
Not exactly.
Hello, Elena.
Uncle John.
Sir, are you ok?
What happened?
I'm...Lost.
And you're laying in the middle of the road?
Not that kind of lost.
Metaphorically.
Existentially.
Do you need help?
Yes, I do.
Can you help me?
You're drunk.
No. Uh, well, yes, a little maybe.
No, please don't leave. I really do need help.
Don't move.
I don't want any trouble.
Neither do I.
But it's all I got is trouble.
Why can't I move?
What's your name?
Jessica. Hi, Jessica.
I have a secret.
I have a big one.
But I never said it out loud.
I mean, what's the point?
It's not going to change anything.
It's not going to make me good.
Make me adopt a puppy.
I can't be what other people want me to be.
What she wants me to be.
This is who I am, Jessica.
Are you going to hurt me?
I'm not sure.
Because you...
You're my existential crisis.
Do I kill you?
Do I not kill you?
Please don't.
But I have to, Jessica.
Because I'm not human.
And I miss it. I miss it more than anything in the world.
That's my secret.
But there's only so much hurt a man can take.
Please don't.
Ok.
You're free to go.
