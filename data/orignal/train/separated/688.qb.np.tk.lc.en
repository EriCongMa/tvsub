the falcon is back on the graysons &apos; payroll .
then let &apos;s go hunting .
could it be that you &apos;ve lied about the pregnancy
you claim to have terminated ?
you want proof ? i &apos;ll give it to you .
i think that we &apos;re in this for the same thing--
to get what we can from conrad
before we take him down .
so you with me ?
i bumped into emily on my way in ,
and naturally i inferred that you two had got back together ,
which she confirmed .
i hope this isn &apos;t too awkward for you .
no . all is fair in love and war , as they say .
charlotte ! what just happened ?
you okay ?
this is for padma
and colleen .
what happened with trask ?
he killed padma .
destroying evidence ?
i &apos;m not saying a word .
a person &apos;s true identity can often be difficult to discern ...
even to themselves ,
causing one to question their character ...
their calling ...
their very existence .
for most , time provides clarity .
but for others ...
these questions remain unanswered ...
for an identity cannot be fully defined ...
when it is a guarded secret .
you know , i &apos;ve even missed your mysterious exits .
i didn &apos;t want to wake you .
i haven &apos;t slept this well
since there was a ring on your hand .
history repeating itself ,
just like us .
so i made reservations at la bernadier for lunch .
i got that table you like .
we don &apos;t have to hide the fact that we &apos;re dating anymore .
might as well go on a few actual dates .
ems ?
you there ?
sorry . i was ... up worrying about nolan .
the police were questioning him all night .
but they didn &apos;t charge him ?
that &apos;s because he didn &apos;t murder anybody .
well , i &apos;ve learned the hard way ,
that the truth doesn &apos;t always set you free .
listen , they &apos;re gonna release him in a few hours .
i really want to be there .
then let &apos;s put lunch on hold .
give me five . i &apos;ll drive you .
no , i @-@ i think i should probably go by myself .
the press is gonna be all over this .
you remember what they were like when you were acquitted .
like sharks in a blood frenzy .
i &apos;ll call you later , okay ?
well , someone out there clearly has you targeted .
i &apos;m just trying to protect you .
oh , spare me .
the only thing you &apos;re protecting is your pompous campaign .
here are the medical records you so sensitively demanded .
proof of the termination of my pregnancy .
though what you &apos;re going to do with it ,
i can only imagine .
well , my plan is to stay ahead of the press .
nightline &apos;s reporters are among the most thorough .
if they try and break the scandal this evening ,
we are now poised to counter with an appropriate response .
you mean spin .
victoria , you were a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl ,
the victim of horrible abuse by your stepfather .
your own mother banished you to the streets .
now detestable as it is , the truth ,
in this case , would only work to our advantage
and highlight the campaign &apos;s promise of full transparency .
the cavalier way that you exploit my personal pain
is appalling .
if you &apos;ve been
suffering with your choices all these years , my dear ,
i &apos;m only happy i was able to provide you
with a comfortable place in which to agonize in style .
we need to adjust your talking points
for this evening &apos;s &quot; nightline &quot; interview downtown .
you are deranged if you think
that i &apos;m going to sit by your side on live tv
while i expose my personal life to shore up your voting base .
well , my darling , your presence is mandatory ,
so i suggest ... that you be on the chopper at 5 : 00 .
and i suggest that you go to hell .
i come bearing gifts .
black coffee for you ,
skinny nonfat cappuccino for me ,
and a not @-@ too @-@ hot hot chocolate for carl .
i &apos;m sorry . i have no idea what babies drink .
not that .
thanks , ashley .
and that &apos;s not all .
what &apos;s this ?
conrad &apos;s official schedule .
i may have been demoted ,
but i still have access to his calendar .
is there anything here i can use ?
the election &apos;s a week away .
i still don &apos;t have enough leverage
to get conrad to confess to what he did to amanda .
allow me to draw your attention
to the three tax board meetings this week .
they &apos;re all rubbish .
he and i concluded the tax board sessions last month .
my guess--those meetings are a smoke screen .
what do you think he has planned ?
i wouldn &apos;t put anything past that man ,
but unfortunately , i &apos;m unable to dig any further
without arousing his suspicion .
don &apos;t put yourself at risk .
i can take care of it from here .
well , do it quickly .
he &apos;s gaining confidence , and with good reason .
recent polling showing
conrad grayson within striking distance
of embattled incumbent governor mark stoddard ,
who seems to be fielding one bad campaign leak after the next .
in other breaking news ,
tech guru nolan ross has just been released from custody
after being held for questioning in the murder
of former employee and rumored lover padma lahari .
go .
thanks , aiden . i &apos;ll see you soon .
20 hours ...
they kept me in that place ...
shoving pictures of padma in my face--
the crime scene , her body .
nolan , i know how you &apos;re feeling . i &apos;m sorry .
i want to help you .
how ?
by taking down the falcon .
listen , if it weren &apos;t for him ,
they would never have been able to frame my father
or force padma into delivering that program .
it doesn &apos;t matter who killed her , nolan .
the falcon is the reason that she &apos;s dead .
look , believe me ,
i want to make him pay .
but he &apos;s been underground for two decades .
no one knows what he looks like ,
let alone how to contact him .
victoria does .
she gave conrad documents this morning
that prove she terminated her first pregnancy ,
but we both know that &apos;s a lie ,
which means that she &apos;s got someone covering her tracks ,
someone tech @-@ savvy enough
to alter hospital records in a matter of hours .
uh , what hospital ?
i tracked down the nun who helped victoria .
she sent me to st. michael &apos;s , but , of course ,
there &apos;s no record of her ever giving birth there .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t go head @-@ to @-@ head with the falcon .
he is ... the best there is .
better than me .
i don &apos;t believe that for a second .
nolan , listen to me , this could be our only chance
to bring the falcon to his knees .
but i can &apos;t do it alone .
then let &apos;s take the bastard down .
第二季 第十八集
we were mortified at the evidence presented at the trial .
david clarke was our trusted friend ,
or so we thought .
once the prosecution presented the data seized from his computer ,
david &apos;s betrayal became clear .
uh , the communiques , the money laundering--
the evidence was black @-@ and @-@ white .
evidence fabricated by the falcon .
look , i know how important taking this guy down is to you ,
but are you sure about using nolan ?
i mean , if he makes a mistake ,
then you risk jeopardizing your own operation .
nolan was like a son to my father .
and after what happened with padma , he needs this .
i found it .
i searched the records at st . michael &apos;s hospital ,
and look what i found buried in the code .
so this falcon--
he just works for the highest bidder ?
true hackers are all about the challenge ,
proving they &apos;re the best .
so his ego is his weakness .
we can use that to draw him out .
how ?
if victoria believes that someone found out about her procedure--
she would go straight to the falcon ,
accuse him of sloppy handiwork ,
and that would blow his motherboard .
i think i &apos;ve got just the thing
to push victoria over the edge .
oh , patrick , sweetheart ,
be quiet for mommy , please ?
reminds me of arshile gorky .
with a dash of kandinsky .
art student ?
just spend a lot of time at the new york artist academy library .
i &apos;m the dean of admissions there .
oh , wow . small world .
you have a good eye .
and he has a matching pair .
oh , no . i &apos;m just the baby &apos;s au pair .
you know , we have several scholarships available .
伪造
you can imagine how deeply disturbed
i was by that e @-@ mail .
clearly , someone has managed to expose your forgery ,
伪造
which you led me to believe was next to impossible .
not next to impossible . impossible .
oh , i suggest that you consult an online dictionary
for the meaning of the word .
don &apos;t forget that while you may be able to disguise your voice
with parlor room theatrics , i know your true identity .
what do you want ?
the source of the leak .
uncover it , seal it ...
permanently .
emily .
what are you doing here ?
well , nolan said that you &apos;ve been calling , so ...
i wanted to let you know that he &apos;s okay ,
but he &apos;s just gonna lay low .
you didn &apos;t have to come all this way to tell me that .
i wanted to check in on my godson as well .
emily , i don &apos;t need you ... coming down here all the time ,
worrying about us .
well , i do worry ,
and i promised amanda that i &apos;d look after her family .
while shacking up with the one that ruined hers .
jack ...
i can &apos;t do this right now .
i got somewhere i gotta be .
carl hasn &apos;t cried once since his last bottle .
i think i &apos;m starting to get the hang of it .
ashley .
i thought you hated babies .
turns out , carl &apos;s the exception .
he &apos;s quite the little charmer .
like i said , emily ,
we &apos;re okay .
the only way i &apos;ll make it through harvard is if you &apos;re by my side .
大学招生日
your grades won &apos;t matter as much if you crush the s.a.t. ,
top it off with a killer essay
and a letter from my father .
no , i @-@ i just don &apos;t think i &apos;m a harvard guy , charlotte .
i was thinking more like n.y.u. or something .
but they want a killer essay , too ,
and i haven &apos;t even started the first sentence .
well , look , i &apos;ll come over tonight and help you out with it .
by the time we &apos;re through ,
there won &apos;t be a dry eye in that admissions office .
thank you .
good luck , not that you &apos;ll need it .
bye .
you sure know how to hit a bitch .
looking for round two ?
relax .
it &apos;s a compliment .
so you &apos;re &quot; overachieving ivy leaguer &quot; now ?
last year , weren &apos;t you &quot; spoiled , angry party girl &quot; ?
which one &apos;s the real charlotte grayson ?
it &apos;s clarke . what do you want , gina ?
a simple answer .
when you took all those pills last year ,
were you really trying to kill yourself ?
what the hell kind of question is that ?
the kind i wish i could ask my brother .
he did the same thing last summer .
swallowed , like , half a pharmacy .
i was just wondering what he was feeling before he died .
that really sucks .
you want to get outta here ?
yes . the whole world .
i still can &apos;t believe padma &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s crazy , but , uh ...
sometimes i ...
catch myself i.m.ing her , like , at work ,
like she &apos;s still down the hall .
and then it ...
it hits me all over again .
that &apos;s not crazy .
the loss never really goes away .
but taking action helps with the pain .
i should &apos;ve tracked down the falcon while david was still alive .
don &apos;t do that to yourself .
you are not responsible for this , nolan .
the graysons and the falcon are .
somebody ...
just accessed victoria &apos;s medical records .
falcon took the bait .
oh , which means he &apos;s about to trigger
that little rewrite i did to his code .
a little too on the nose ?
got him to respond the way we wanted him to .
&quot; d.y.t. &quot; ?
&quot; defend your title . &quot;
back in &apos; 88,
i set the world record on &quot; street fighter &quot;
at the mongoblaster tournament .
it was held at , uh , teddy &apos;s arcade in brooklyn .
looks like the falcon &apos;s ready to play .
tell nolan to take as much time away as he needs ,
and if there &apos;s anything else i can do to help ,
just let me know , okay ?
thanks , daniel . and nolan says thanks , too .
listen , i was thinking about coming to the studio later
to see your interview .
that is , if you think your father won &apos;t mind .
no . no , not at all .
i @-@ i &apos;d love to have you there .
great . i &apos;ll see you then .
i love the jedi mind trick on danny boy .
but it &apos;ll all be for bubkes if i can &apos;t break the falcon .
you will .
mr. grayson , your 2 : 00 .
mr. takeda , thank you for the meeting .
it &apos;s been a long time .
yes , it has .
please take a seat .
thank you .
i know your time is valuable , so i &apos;ll get to the point .
i &apos;m concerned about aiden mathis .
he &apos;s recently made some unauthorized ,
and dare i say , reckless trades .
well , big risks , big rewards .
unfortunately , his aggressive style
has upset some long @-@ term clients--
clients that i can &apos;t afford to disappoint .
now i assume you &apos;ve kept your personnel files of all your employees .
absolutely . extensively .
i was wondering if i could look over mathis &apos; ,
if you wouldn &apos;t mind , of course .
yes--
daniel , how--how familiar are you with the overton ...
mr. takeda .
this is a surprise .
if , uh , if you two gentlemen are finished ,
i &apos;d like to take my old boss out for a drink .
of course .
mr. takeda , thank you for agreeing to the meeting .
appreciate your help .
thank you , mr. grayson .
this place is awesome .
i had no idea it was here .
well , the coolest places are the hardest to find .
same goes for people .
definitely true in your case .
you sure don &apos;t make it easy .
i don &apos;t care what people think .
that must be nice .
why do you ?
i mean , you &apos;re practically a celebrity .
you should be out using the grayson name to do whatever you want .
but instead , now you hide from it .
i &apos;m not hiding .
i just don &apos;t have the luxury of being invisible .
if i mess up , my parents know about it within ten minutes .
screw them .
embrace your inner bad girl and come out with me tonight .
i can &apos;t .
i promised declan i &apos;d help him with his college essay .
or you can tear it up with me
and to hell with the rest of the world .
it &apos;s your choice .
jump in anytime .
i &apos;m waiting for someone .
you win .
a bird of prey , perhaps ?
falcon ?
smart move ,
using grayson to get my attention .
what do you want ?
thanks to you ,
i &apos;m currently the prime suspect
in the murder of my girlfriend .
and there are certain details of my life
i &apos;d prefer didn &apos;t surface in the investigation .
i need everything on this drive scrubbed from the web .
i &apos;d do it myself , but , uh ...
they &apos;re watching my every keystroke .
i &apos;ll pay you whatever you want .
don &apos;t insult me , ross .
did you hack into the state department back in &apos; 91 to make money ?
oh , yeah . i know everything about you .
your real middle name is leslie .
your hacker handle was &quot; lord zolton . &quot;
you used to visit david clarke in prison , which means
you undoubtedly believe i played a role in his demise .
look , will you help me or not ?
i think i &apos;ll pass .
uh , how about , uh ...
we play for it ?
i win , you do the job for me .
and when i win ?
you won &apos;t .
jack , what &apos;s going on ?
how you doing ?
i &apos;m sending you some pics .
oh , my god . that &apos;s alison stoddard .
what the hell is conrad doing with the governor &apos;s wife ?
you &apos;re out of practice , ross .
you &apos;ve been spending too much time in the real world .
what ? you should visit it more often .
you of all people should know ,
the only existence that matters is online .
you know what ?
you are hiding in a world of ones and zeros ...
too afraid to make an emotional connection .
caring for someone doesn &apos;t make you weak .
it makes you stronger ,
which is why ...
you ... just ...
got ... schooled .
you win .
knockout .
now ...
you either
honor our agreement ,
or it &apos;s game over
for your precious hacker reputation .
charlotte .
you &apos;ve been avoiding me .
no , mother . i &apos;ve just been busy .
punching classmates in the face ?
would you have approved if i slapped her instead ?
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m outta here
before dad drags me into his interview .
oh , you &apos;re safe .
i believe he &apos;s on the way to the studio right now .
and i believe you &apos;re mistaken .
ah , and for the piece de resistance ,
the true heart and soul of our family home ,
my ever @-@ beauteous better half ,
victoria .
conrad , what is this ?
the full @-@ access tour for the &quot; nightline &quot; audience .
uh , would you mind if we take a few minutes
before ms. chang &apos;s arrival ?
looks good . that &apos;s great .
now , now , now ,
before you turn me to stone with that look ,
you left me with little choice , my dear .
and you have left me with a little bit of a migraine .
i expect you to convey that to ms. chang .
oh , victoria , look , i--
look , i &apos;m sorry ... for the ambush ,
but i implore you . would you do this for me ?
my god . you really do want this .
oh , second only to how much i &apos;ve always wanted you .
well , you can only have one of those .
never fear , conrad .
i &apos;ll assist you in your rise to power .
your emotions for emily have endangered her mission .
daniel &apos;s growing suspicious of your past ,
a past that should &apos;ve been erased ,
along with your name .
i thought my sister was still alive .
i wanted to keep my name so she could contact me .
more emotions . more mistakes .
no .
emily needs me .
you &apos;re wrong .
this path ...
that you &apos;ve led us down leads nowhere .
you see ...
i killed the man who murdered my sister .
it gave me no peace .
so vengeance isn &apos;t the answer .
and when emily &apos;s mission is over ,
then she &apos;ll realize that .
and i &apos;m gonna end this , fast ,
and with no more casualties .
and there &apos;s nothing that you can say
that would change my mind .
governor mark stoddard ...
and his wife alison have been married for 28 years .
both native ithacans .
alison actually defeated mark
in the race to become student council president .
i don &apos;t think that conrad and alison
are having an affair .
is she even his type ?
she &apos;s a woman .
something else is going on .
but what could it be ?
i couldn &apos;t say ,
but after years spent in the revolving door of grayson manor ,
i do know one thing .
conrad has a tell .
it betrays when he &apos;s lying .
he opens his mouth ?
no , it &apos;s in his eyes .
if i had five minutes with that man ,
i swear i could get to the bottom of this ,
but unfortunately , i am persona non grata again .
not if you play your cards right .
who knew i had it in me ?
oh , besides you , of course .
although ... truth be told ,
you throw me a token
and jump me in front of &quot; street fighter , &quot;
and ... i turn into bruce friggin &apos; lee .
until , uh ...
i &apos;m in front of actual flesh @-@ and @-@ bone bad guys ,
and i ... fall apart .
you got the falcon to do exactly what we needed .
yeah , i gotta give her props
for that &quot; victor victoria &quot; gag .
no wonder no one could find ... shim .
well , that &apos;s about to change .
i &apos;ve gotta get to the interview .
i will text you an i.p. address
right before they go live .
i &apos;ll be ready .
don &apos;t worry .
no one can prove you mothered a kid out there .
not even the kid .
are you absolutely certain ?
because there is a news crew setting up in my living room ,
ready to go live .
do you understand me ?
you weren &apos;t the target . i was .
you just got caught in some high @-@ tech cross fire
between hackers .
i won &apos;t be collateral damage in your duel .
i told you , your secret is safe .
i @-@ i got the scholarship ?
two years at l &apos;ecole des beaux arts ,
all expenses paid .
your flight to paris is next week .
there &apos;s only one ticket .
well , because there &apos;s only one scholarship .
but i can &apos;t just leave patrick .
you have a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity , vicky .
the kid &apos;s parents will find another nanny .
thank you . no , it &apos;ll be great .
i &apos;ll talk to her now . all right .
you made it .
deja vu .
are you sure you &apos;re ready to face the cameras again ?
the question is , are you ?
the producers are pushing for you to join me .
now i know it &apos;s a little late--
daniel , how quickly have you forgotten ?
emily values her privacy . isn &apos;t that so ?
actually , i &apos;d love to do whatever i can
for conrad &apos;s campaign .
what &apos;s good for one grayson is good for all of you ,
isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m as grateful as i am humbled .
then it &apos;s settled .
great .
daniel , we &apos;re ready .
i &apos;ll corner conrad as soon as the interview &apos;s over .
and i &apos;ll keep my ears open .
so , daniel ,
the last time you sat down with &quot; nightline , &quot;
you had just endured a grueling murder trial ,
grayson global was on the verge of financial collapse .
and yet , here we are a year later ,
you &apos;re c.e.o. of the family business ,
you &apos;re reunited with your fiancee ,
and &quot; vanity fair &quot; went so far as to call you
&quot; this generation &apos;s john @-@ john and carolyn . &quot;
i @-@ i don &apos;t know about that last part ,
but , um , i won &apos;t deny
i &apos;m thrilled to be back with emily .
well , in keeping with your father &apos;s platform
for transparency ,
perhaps you &apos;d like to comment
on the flip @-@ flop from last year &apos;s interview .
back then , you vowed full support for your father ,
and yet , recently , there have been reports
that you led a coup against him at grayson global .
all due respect ,
simply the press trying to stir up a story .
no , my father stepped down
to focus on his political career ,
and i humbly filled the vacancy .
fair enough . now , emily ,
the press is clamoring for details
about your rekindled romance .
and yet , you don &apos;t seem to share the graysons &apos; policy
for transparency .
well , daniel and i aren &apos;t ones to kiss and tell .
you know , when daniel suggested that
you join us for this interview ,
i asked him if there were wedding bells in the offing ,
and he said i should ask you directly .
well ... one thing that i &apos;ve learned
is that you never can be certain what the future holds .
that being said ,
i can &apos;t imagine an honor greater
than joining the grayson family .
well , from where i &apos;m sitting , it &apos;s a perfect fit .
jack .
what do you want ?
listen , i &apos;m sorry you had to see that .
i owe you an explanation .
you don &apos;t owe me anything .
what you saw tonight ,
it isn &apos;t what you think .
i know what i saw , emily .
you &apos;re gonna be a grayson .
and frankly , i don &apos;t want anyone from that family
around my son .
what are you saying ?
i don &apos;t want you to be carl &apos;s godmother anymore .
bye , emily .
已签完封好并寄出 都是你的了
yeah ?
okay , slow down .
作为一名纽约大学的毕业生
oh , it &apos;s declan .
i completely forgot to cancel with him .
go . i &apos;m right behind you .
all right .
declan .
charlotte , hey .
i thought you were gonna help me with this essay .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s just , my parents have this stupid interview ,
so they &apos;ve hidden me away in the tower
to maintain the family image .
well , then why don &apos;t i come to you ?
i can bring carl , and--and he &apos;d love to see you .
i know his uncle would , too .
um , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
look , i promise i &apos;ll help you tomorrow .
i really gotta go .
hold on . i--
can you check again ? we &apos;re on the list .
excuse me , sir ?
can you please check one ...
it &apos;s under &quot; grayson . &quot;
hey , charlotte , over here .
pose for the camera .
hey , come on .
how about a smile , ladies ?
feel like putting on a show ?
well , needless to say , a man in my position
will always be subjected to scandal and turmoil .
but the challenges that we have faced as a family
have only fortified our commitment to truth , openness ,
and accountability .
okay , yeah .
that &apos;s precisely why we &apos;ve welcomed you into our home .
well , i have to say , i &apos;m so happy to hear that ,
because my team has just independently confirmed
a tip that we received
about a long @-@ secret pregnancy--
uh , juju , i &apos;m gonna-- i &apos;m gonna stop you right there .
uh , apparently , it was only a matter of time
before my opponent would use
this painful chapter of my wife &apos;s past against me .
victoria faced a tragic choice
in her adolescence .
i know that if she had the opportunity to do it over ,
she would obviously have chosen life .
mr. grayson , i &apos;m sorry .
just to be clear ,
are you saying your wife had an abortion ?
in 1973 , yes .
and while we wish we could &apos;ve kept the matter private ,
we &apos;re not afraid of the truth .
wait . wait . for the record , mrs. grayson ,
are you now denying that you abandoned
a 6 @-@ month @-@ old boy named patrick
to enroll in a european art school ?
the story is true .
&quot; nightline &quot; will be back after this commercial break .
i really should watch more television .
oh , i thought you might be calling .
the only evidence of victoria &apos;s son ...
existed on my computer , ross .
how did you do it ?
what , you didn &apos;t catch that little present
that i left on your jump drive ?
the second you plugged it in ,
a shadow program automatically booted ,
giving me access to your computer ,
which i can see you hacking away on
at your not @-@ so @-@ secret cyberspot .
i already know
everything there is to know about you ,
and , uh , i &apos;m not the only one .
check your in @-@ box , edith .
yeah .
nice , clear shot , wouldn &apos;t you say ?
the fbi certainly thought so .
keep your hands where i can see &apos; em .
you messed with the wrong person !
so did you .
the falc0n was a consultant for grayson global--
edith lee .
back then , she was just a computer prodigy
brought in to design the company &apos;s internal network .
so when the graysons needed an expert
to fake evidence against my father ,
they used someone in @-@ house .
david clarke &apos;s betrayal was the birth of the falc0n .
after that , she erased her identity ,
went off the grid .
there was a girl in the retreat photo .
she never showed up in any of my research .
i always just ...
assumed she was an employee &apos;s daughter .
another face for you to cross off .
actually .
this one &apos;s all you .
to padma .
and david .
listen , i &apos;m gonna call you later , okay ?
how are you holding up ?
i &apos;m fine .
at this point , nothing my parents do surprises me .
even the likelihood that you have a brother out there ?
yeah , well , maybe that , but right now
all that concerns me is you .
are you angry ?
why , because my boyfriend sandbagged me
on live tv ?
boyfriend ?
you know , that &apos;s the--
that &apos;s the first time you &apos;ve called me that
since we got back together .
listen , i &apos;m sorry for what i did .
but you didn &apos;t leave me much choice .
the only thing keeping us from being together is you .
and if history really is gonna repeat itself ,
i can &apos;t do this .
i want to spend the rest of my life with you , emily .
but only if you want the same .
the next time i see you ,
if you decided to put that ring back on your finger ,
i &apos;ll have my answer .
if you &apos;re thinking of jumping ,
allow me to assist you .
i &apos;m in no mood for your gallows humor .
that &apos;s ironic ,
considering how you hanged my reputation tonight .
your reputation ?
i don &apos;t give a damn about your reputation .
yeah , or your son you &apos;ve been covering up .
or how did she put you abandoned ?
yeah , all those years ago .
well ... it &apos;s only a matter of time now
before the media bloodhounds drag him out into the open .
i &apos;ll leave you to your demons .
thanks for watching carl .
everything okay ?
i was watching the grayson interview on tv .
whole family &apos;s a train wreck , aren &apos;t they ?
except for charlotte .
so this , um , emily and daniel thing--
is that , i don &apos;t know , is that weird for you ?
i &apos;m done with emily .
i don &apos;t want her around my son anymore .
dec , from now on , we gotta be careful who we trust .
who , like ashley ?
ashley &apos;s slick , but ...
i &apos;m using her to my advantage .
good night .
good night .
quite a show .
you know , if i were still
your trusted director of communications ,
i would &apos;ve advised against live television .
yeah , well , hindsight is always 20 / 20 .
or &quot; nightline &quot; in this case .
ms. davenport , did you really come all this way
to vaunt your ability to gloat ?
i also came to help .
you need to be more careful .
i &apos;ve put too much into this to sit on the sidelines
in the final week of the election
and watch it go down in flames .
welcome back .
hello , nolan .
victoria .
what a ... well ...
pleasant surprise .
to what do i owe ?
you &apos;re a computer genius , and a reformed hacker
if one &apos;s to believe your publicist .
oh , she added &quot; reformed . &quot;
might i add ...
reinstated sole owner of nolcorp ?
oh . interesting .
and ... in return ?
help me find my firstborn son .
as much as i hate to say it ,
shouldn &apos;t you be with daniel right about now ?
i was .
daniel &apos;s pushing me to define our relationship .
what , are you asking me for my permission ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , this was your plan all along , wasn &apos;t it ?
rip the golden boy away from his family ,
tear the graysons apart from the inside ?
leave them broken , powerless .
yes .
well , then tell me this one thing .
when this is all over , when ...
when they &apos;ve paid for what they did to your father ,
then what ?
i can be with you .
then marry the son of a bitch .
and take them down once and for all .
