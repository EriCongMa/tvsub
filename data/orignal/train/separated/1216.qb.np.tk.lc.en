i &apos;m already number one on her hit list .
if alison finds out i &apos;m siding with you guys ,
i &apos;m afraid to think of how far she &apos;d go to stop me .
you think that alison &apos;s &quot; a &quot; ?
hello .
if i try to tell mike that mona isn &apos;t what he &apos;s looking for ...
you won &apos;t be able to separate them with a crowbar .
i &apos;m mrs. grunwald .
ali was calling grunwald
because she believed that she could help her .
what kind of help could you give her ?
i have a gift of insight .
what &apos;s wrong ?
my parents want me to come to california after christmas .
this letter proves alison knew bethany .
it could create enough reasonable doubt to clear spencer .
the investigation is ongoing ,
although we did not find a body .
the amount of blood in the house would indicate
that the victim &apos;s wounds were fatal .
mona vanderwaal was murdered .
they know that thing &apos;s empty , right ?
it &apos;s a casket and it still weighs a ton .
mona &apos;s mom put keepsakes in it .
stuffed animals , photo albums ,
old retainer .
it &apos;s called a cenotaph .
they have them for soldiers whose bodies are never found .
never say never , spence .
it &apos;s been over three months , han ,
no body , no murder weapon .
and no arrest .
well , present company excluded .
let &apos;s not forget i &apos;m still an alleged murderer .
hey , don &apos;t lose faith , okay ?
that letter bethany sent ali could still make a difference .
no , not if holbrook has anything to say about it .
we should &apos;ve told tanner about him and ali months ago .
tanner won &apos;t believe it
coming from you or anyone else .
she &apos;s gonna have to figure it out on her own .
i &apos;m gonna go and get the car .
okay .
what the hell is she doing here ?
showing up to your victim &apos;s funeral ?
classy .
you guys , we have to get her out of here .
mrs. vanderwaal ?
i came to pay my respects .
and to tell you , one more time ,
that i had nothing to do with your--
then where is my daughter ?
where is her body ?
it &apos;s okay .
come with me .
mrs. vanderwaal ?
i put a load in the dishwasher .
do you need any help folding the chairs ?
no . thank you , hanna .
is there anything that you need ?
no , it &apos;s all right .
then i think i &apos;ll go .
i &apos;m sorry about what happened at the service .
it was just her ...
alison , alive .
people understand .
it &apos;s like mona was lost at sea .
i accept that she &apos;s dead .
my daughter is dead .
but where is she ?
an empty casket ... what was i thinking ?
i think that you were trying to find a way to say goodbye .
we all are .
and that funeral probably helped a lot of people .
i hope it helped someone .
i &apos;ll just go fold those chairs before i go .
hanna .
i want you to take care of this .
how are you doing ?
i heard what happened at the church .
it was so ghastly .
hanna stopped mona &apos;s mom ,
but we all wanted to stuff ali into that empty coffin .
i should have been there .
no , really , we wanted to do it on our own .
mom &apos;s not here .
well , i know .
she called me , asked me to come by .
why ? what happened ?
bethany young &apos;s parents have petitioned the court
to have your bail revoked .
okay .
they &apos;ve been trying to do that for months .
yes , but this time , it may work .
why ?
they unsealed your indictment today .
we finally know why you were arrested .
it &apos;s an open file .
i didn &apos;t break any rules looking at it .
what you &apos;re looking for isn &apos;t there . it &apos;s here .
the grounds for spencer hastings &apos; arrest warrant .
that was unsealed today .
what convinced the judge
was a statement from a witness .
someone who saw spencer hastings
in the dilaurentis backyard with a girl ,
a blonde dressed in alison &apos;s clothes ,
the night that bethany was buried in that yard .
who was the witness ?
jessica dilaurentis .
mrs. dilaurentis saw spencer
in the backyard and told the police ?
where &apos;s the statement been for two years ?
where it has been is deliberately hidden
in the files of the officer
who took the statement , darren wilden .
we found it just before thanksgiving .
wilden had suppressed it .
he may have buried the statement ,
but mrs. d. was still alive .
what stopped her from telling someone else ?
why do you think she didn &apos;t ?
wilden was crooked .
he told somebody about the statement ,
somebody who &apos;d want it to go away ,
and they paid him to keep mrs. dilaurentis quiet .
how do you suppose he could do that ?
well , bethany was a patient at radley .
mrs. dilaurentis was on the board .
she had an affair with bethany &apos;s father .
that &apos;s probably where they met .
it always seems to lead back to radley , doesn &apos;t it ?
where &apos;s your partner ?
oh , detective holbrook ?
he &apos;s out on temporary assignment .
once it &apos;s all done , this will all be bookshelves .
oh , looks good ...
in a &quot; has to get really messy
before it gets clean &quot; kind of way .
yeah . well , i appreciate your optimism .
but i think you need to get your eyes checked .
have you heard from oberlin ?
no .
no , i haven &apos;t yet .
maybe tomorrow .
have you heard from mike since the funeral ?
i kind of lost track of him
after the slap heard around the world .
why ?
i &apos;m just wondering how he &apos;s doing .
mona was a lot of complicated things
to a lot of different people ,
but she was just one thing to mike .
he loved her ...
and i was the one who tried to screw it up ,
twice .
he doesn &apos;t want to talk to me about her .
i could try .
i could say that i need help with my bookshelves .
you do need help with your bookshelves .
see , it &apos;s a win @-@ win .
did you finish packing ?
yes .
i thought three months ,
i &apos;d get used to the idea of you leaving ...
but i haven &apos;t .
neither have i.
you &apos;ll miss graduation .
my parents say that &apos;s just a technicality .
and prom .
that was a technicality i was looking forward to .
maybe if we talked to your parents one more time .
they can &apos;t hear anything .
i have enough credits to leave early
and that &apos;s all that counts .
they want me someplace safe .
california has earthquakes .
i pointed that out .
it didn &apos;t work though .
i &apos;ll take you to the airport .
my parents will take me . you don &apos;t have to do that .
i don &apos;t have to , i want to .
what ?
i heard a song the other day .
old song .
the girl says , &quot; your eyes .
it &apos;s a day &apos;s work just to look into them . &quot;
so you stayed with mona &apos;s mom
after the others left .
yeah . we cleaned up ,
and she told me how she wished
she &apos;d have done more when mona told her about alison .
oh , god , i wanted to crawl under a rug .
we pushed her to help us .
look , mona was on ali &apos;s radar long before that .
i still felt awful .
any luck with that ?
i know why mona wasn &apos;t afraid to let me keep it .
it is completely encrypted and secured
unlike anything i &apos;ve ever seen .
the only thing i know for sure
is that there are chunks of that hard drive
that i &apos;m completely locked out of .
well , if she went to all that trouble ,
there must be something important in there .
i &apos;m not giving up .
my ego &apos;s at stake now .
what do you think ali did with mona &apos;s body ?
ali &apos;s the only one with that information .
i don &apos;t see her making that public knowledge .
maybe there &apos;s somebody else who knows ,
or somebody that could find out .
who ?
mrs. grunwald .
not a good idea .
but she &apos;s a psychic . a real psychic .
she &apos;s not some card flipper at the carnival .
she has a real gift and we both know it .
you can &apos;t mess around with that stuff .
believe me .
well , then , who else do we ask ?
she saved ali when mrs. d. planted her .
she knows all of us ,
and she seems to like us in some
disturbing , creepy sort of way .
it is not like lo @-@ jack . okay ?
you cannot just call her up and ask where &apos;s the body .
and even if she could tell you ,
how are you going to explain to mrs. vanderwaal
where you got the information , or the police ?
hanna , i know how you feel about mona &apos;s mom ,
but calling grunwald is not going to help anybody .
bad news ?
you don &apos;t have to do that .
do what ?
run from me .
be afraid .
if you want me to believe you &apos;re not
who i think you are , you will leave us all alone .
god , it &apos;s like you went to sleep one night
and forgot who i am .
i know exactly who you are , &quot; a. &quot;
stop saying that .
why should i ?
you &apos;re &quot; a. &quot;
you stole the game from mona
and then you killed her because she had proof .
and you killed bethany
because you were jealous of a mental patient .
that &apos;s how crazy you are .
listen to me , aria .
my parents is talking to the judges right now .
it could be today , it could be tomorrow .
i mean , my mom is at the courthouse ,
she &apos;s trying to fight it , but ...
spencer , that &apos;s crazy , okay .
they can &apos;t just revoke your bail .
well , we have to do something .
what ? we found a letter from bethany
explaining the matching clothes , explaining everything ,
and holbrook is doing whatever he can to get it thrown out ,
to make sure that it looks like i forged the whole thing .
but mona found out that ali hit bethany
with that shovel and was murdered for it .
so if we can prove that ali killed mona ,
the cops will realize that these two crimes are connected ,
that one motivated the other , that you are innocent .
if it were easy to prove that ali &apos;s a murderer ,
wouldn &apos;t we have done that already ?
if mona can find proof , so can we .
i mean , it &apos;s got to be somewhere , right ?
how &apos;s caleb doing with her laptop ?
he &apos;s not giving up , but he &apos;s not getting anywhere either .
guys , as long as ali has an alibi , she &apos;s untouchable .
so then we tear down her alibi .
her dad won &apos;t budge .
i &apos;m not talking about her dad .
hey , i didn &apos;t see you at the cemetery yesterday .
did you leave early ?
i guess .
you did .
okay .
any reason ?
it wasn &apos;t a real funeral .
no ?
no body , no funeral .
does that make you upset ?
i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m trying to get a sense of how this all makes you feel .
you look up how to talk to me online or something ?
i feel like i don &apos;t want to talk to you
about my dead girlfriend .
i just wasn &apos;t sure you thought she was actually gone .
no one loses that much blood and lives to tell the story .
you aren &apos;t acting like you &apos;ve lost someone .
how would you like me to act ?
you want me to cry my eyes out ?
bang my fists on the wall ? she &apos;s gone .
that &apos;s it . people leave . people die .
it &apos;s the only sure thing there is in this world .
你最后的亲吻永远是最甜美的
thank you for coming .
thank you for remembering me .
you &apos;re hard to forget .
i take that as a compliment .
there &apos;s no one in there . it &apos;s empty .
i know .
well , how is it you think i can help you ?
i want you to help me find the body of the girl
that &apos;s supposed to be in that box .
we think that alison killed her .
how do you expect me to find her ?
little bungee .
bungee ?
that &apos;s his name .
how did you know that ?
kitchen &apos;s that way if you want to look for your mom &apos;s
whatever @-@ it @-@ was .
muffin tray .
she swears she left it here .
ali &apos;s not home .
yeah , i know .
you two are never in the same place
at the same time these days .
that a trick question ?
no .
no , it &apos;s just a regular statement .
what do you want , spencer ?
i want to know why you &apos;re protecting her .
the cops found traces of mona &apos;s dna in ali &apos;s trunk .
but it &apos;s not enough to arrest her ,
not when you &apos;re providing her with an alibi .
your dad , i understand .
but you--
it was thanksgiving , spencer .
you &apos;re the only one who finds it hard to believe
we were all together that day .
jason , i know that you--
em , you find those muffins yet ?
uh , no , not yet .
at some point that day ,
she got in her car and she left the house ,
and she didn &apos;t come back for a long time .
i know she &apos;s your sister , but so am i.
she set me up , jason .
i &apos;m gonna go to jail because of her .
somebody &apos;s dead because of her .
they &apos;re the ones that are asking you to lie
and all i want is the truth .
please .
gates and walls ,
dams and barriers .
how can you live in such a psychically
constipated environment ?
i eat a lot of fiber .
secrets are one thing ,
but secrets that carry over into death ,
are very toxic .
it makes it hard to see clearly .
i see ,
but as through a glass darkly .
did alison kill mona ?
你最后的亲吻永远是最甜美的
each one hated the other ...
because each one feared the other ,
because ...
each one knew something about the other .
where &apos;s mona ?
she isn &apos;t in rosewood . she &apos;s in the dark .
she is not having an easy passing .
betrayal .
betrayal and loss .
her soul is caught , bound .
she is surrounded by earth
and insects and cold .
there is no peace , only fear .
well , that was a bust .
spencer .
no , em , just , you should go , okay ?
go , be with paige ,
because at least one of us
deserves a good last day in rosewood .
what is that ?
i stole ali &apos;s hairbrush .
why would you do that ?
let &apos;s just say the cops were to do another sweep of mona &apos;s house .
sure , ali has an alibi
but how strong can it be
when ali &apos;s dna is found at the crime scene ?
emily , no . first of all , you can &apos;t just tell the cops
to go back and look again .
and second of all ,
creating false evidence is an actual crime .
spencer , you &apos;re being charged with actual murder .
jason , what are you doing here ?
i came by to pick up some files for the office .
they were up in that closet with all dad &apos;s family photos .
you know you have three full baby albums ?
guess , how many i &apos;ve got .
remember this ?
it was a good day .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
dad forgot his wallet .
we were fighting the whole time .
it took eight shots
before we finally got one of us all smiling .
i guess i remember it differently .
you always had a knack for that .
remembering things differently , you and dad .
i wish i had that .
i really do .
you had him wrapped around your finger from day one .
spencer talked to you , didn &apos;t she ?
yeah , she did , and emily .
and they &apos;re right , ali .
you went somewhere on thanksgiving day .
then you came back and barely said a word .
where did you go , ali ?
really .
i &apos;m being framed , jason .
spencer , emily , aria , hanna ...
they &apos;re all working together .
they wish i &apos;d never come back and now they want me gone .
you have to believe me .
i did not kill mona .
well , must be nice to have your own place .
it &apos;s my mom &apos;s name on the lease .
she &apos;s helping me out for a while , so .
here .
i didn &apos;t know how you took it ,
but there &apos;s cream and sugar in the bag .
thanks .
what &apos;s all this ?
decryption software .
it &apos;s searching for any existing patterns
that may have been used to encrypt mona &apos;s data .
we find the pattern , we unlock the files .
sounds fancy .
yeah , well , the problem is that
mona isn &apos;t using any known patterns .
she made them all up .
i &apos;ve been running decryption software for months with no luck .
so all this hacking stuff ,
does it like work on websites too ?
you trying out for anonymous or something ?
no , of course not .
aria , your sudoku prowess doesn &apos;t exactly qualify you
to help out with this kind of stuff .
you know that .
so why are you here ?
okay . three months ago , i applied to six colleges ,
and i didn &apos;t get into brown .
that &apos;s fine .
it was kind of a stretch , but oberlin ?
i mean , i nailed that interview .
so you want me to break into oberlin &apos;s database
and find out why you got rejected ?
yeah , i need to know if it &apos;s me or if it &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
all right . take a seat .
what am i supposed to do with all this ?
give a man a fish , he only eats for a day .
all right , caleb , look , if you don &apos;t want to help ...
okay , teach me .
do you know how long mona &apos;s mom is gonna be gone ?
i don &apos;t know . we have to act fast .
god , the last time i was here ...
we were stepping over mona &apos;s blood .
okay . so the police have already searched ,
so we have to think of places that they might have missed ,
or places that the hair could have moved since then .
okay .
bingo .
you guys tell mona &apos;s mom
that she &apos;s got cameras in her molding .
why does it have to be me ?
because she likes you .
if you suggest the police
should take another look , she &apos;ll listen .
just tell her that mona said something about cameras ,
and how she was scared .
what makes you sure it was mona &apos;s camera ?
because if her mother knew it was there ,
she would have told the police .
why can &apos;t you ask toby ?
i mean , he &apos;s just joined the police force .
do you want me to tell him that i found it
while i was trying to plant evidence ?
you guys , i have to take a step back
from the mona of it all , i really do .
hanna , that blood we saw inside mona &apos;s front door ,
that camera was pointed right at it .
okay , it must have seen what happened .
i &apos;ve decided what to do .
i &apos;m going to set up a fund ,
to buy books for the children &apos;s library .
and inside each book there will be a card
with a picture of mona ,
explaining that the book is a gift from her .
i think that &apos;s a really nice idea .
mona loved to read .
for a long time , i think it was all she had .
hanna , do you want to borrow that ?
i can &apos;t read this .
you should .
henry james understood girls .
this is more of a spencer hastings type book .
you &apos;re smarter than spencer hastings .
i am not .
you are .
you just pretend like you aren &apos;t .
it &apos;s another way to hide .
haven &apos;t i taught you anything ?
you don &apos;t have to hide from anyone anymore .
let other people hide from you for a change .
hanna ?
would you like to keep that book ?
thank you .
you know , i &apos;ve been thinking about what you said ,
about mona being afraid ,
and i remember her telling me
that she wanted to set up cameras
to keep an eye on things .
cameras ?
do you think that she would have done something like that ?
hello ?
mike ?
ezra ?
我 没问题 10点到
no .
no ! no !
don &apos;t do this to me .
please .
alison ! ali .
ali . ali .
stop !
hello , alison .
hello , mrs. grunwald .
i was visiting someone in town .
how fortunate to run into you like this .
it &apos;s pretty amazing .
i &apos;m not going to ask you how you are .
when people say that ,
they really don &apos;t want an honest answer , do they ?
they just ask so you &apos;ll say &quot; fine , &quot;
and they don &apos;t have to deal with you anymore .
precisely .
if people meeting casually
told each other how they really felt ,
the streets would be awash with tears .
however , i am sorry for your loss .
i have to be somewhere , mrs. grunwald .
as do we all .
nice to see you .
same here .
you are in my thoughts and prayers , alison .
thank you .
mrs. vanderwaal asked us to search the house again ,
and we found this .
there were three cameras .
this is the only relevant one .
mona put them in herself .
the batteries ran down months ago ,
but they were working on thanksgiving .
is there anything about the attacker
that in any way is familiar to you ?
do you recognize anything about that person ?
it could be my sister .
it could be alison .
how could it be your sister if alison was with you
and your father when the incident occurred ?
because she wasn &apos;t with us .
that was a lie .
you &apos;re saying that alison wasn &apos;t with you
when mona vanderwaal was killed ?
that &apos;s right .
thank you , mr. dilaurentis .
does ezra know what happened ?
no , and i &apos;m going to keep it that way .
are you sure it was ali who attacked you and took the computer ?
who else could it be ?
that &apos;s not what i asked .
yes , i &apos;m sure .
what is it ?
it &apos;s paige .
i wanted to take her to the airport , but she has to leave now .
oh , maybe that &apos;s what you should do .
no , we have to do this together .
can you at least try to stall them ?
get out of my way .
now !
you killed mona , ali .
we &apos;re not letting you get away .
&quot; a &quot; set me up .
you &apos;re letting &quot; a &quot; win .
shut up , ali .
who &apos;s going to protect you when i &apos;m gone ?
if you do this ,
you &apos;ll all be next .
move !
now !
hands above your head .
ladies , move .
turn around slowly .
don &apos;t say i didn &apos;t warn you .
alison dilaurentis , you are under arrest
for the murder of mona vanderwaal .
turn around .
you found my phone .
yeah .
can i talk to you for a second ?
i &apos;m starving . can we do this later ?
alison &apos;s been arrested ...
for mona &apos;s murder .
okay .
okay ? that &apos;s your response ?
just sit down , please .
here &apos;s the thing .
i &apos;m afraid to know what you know .
mona knew a lot of things ,
about me , a lot of things about my friends .
you know , this time i thought that it was you
that was afraid to talk to me , but really i ...
i think that it was me who was afraid to talk to you .
but if ali &apos;s behind bars ...
maybe that means that we don &apos;t have to be afraid anymore .
i know you hated mona .
maybe for good reason , maybe not .
but now you &apos;re just like the rest of them ...
pretending she was a saint when you didn &apos;t even know her .
you know what that &apos;s like ,
listening to a bunch of people memorialize someone they don &apos;t even know ?
you think if people said how great she was to her face ,
none of this would &apos;ve ever happened ?
i &apos;m sick of being told
how sweet and smart and nice she was .
she wasn &apos;t nice .
anyone can be nice .
there will never be anyone like her .
ever .
but do you think that maybe sometime you could tell me about her ?
the mona you knew ?
the real mona .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna see if dad needs help with dinner .
this is a free boarding announcement for flight 89b , rome .
we are now inviting passengers with small children
and any passengers requiring special assistance
to begin boarding at this time .
please have your boarding pass and identification ready .
regular boarding will begin in approximately ...
oh , god , you &apos;re here .
you changed your mind .
the airline changed my gate . my flight &apos;s boarding now .
how did you get past security ?
i bought a $ 69 ticket to atlantic city .
paige , you don &apos;t have to go .
they arrested alison for killing mona .
she &apos;s in jail .
she won &apos;t stay there .
yes , she will .
tell your parents , they have to let you stay .
it &apos;s safe now .
emily , i have to go .
listen to me , you don &apos;t .
yes , i do .
i &apos;ve thought about this for months , and i do .
why ?
first , because my parents want me to .
okay . well , we can fight that .
i don &apos;t want to fight anymore .
i &apos;m tired of fighting .
i &apos;ve used so much energy fighting and being afraid ,
i &apos;m worried i &apos;m not gonna have anything left to just live .
you know what i mean .
yeah . i guess i do .
so maybe this isn &apos;t such a bad idea .
you know , it &apos;s a terrible idea .
what if we decide to pretend it &apos;s a good idea ?
this is the final boarding announcement
for flight 214 to san francisco .
all ticketed passengers ,
please make your way to the gate .
please don &apos;t go .
i have to .
okay , well , take another flight .
it &apos;s not going to be any easier tomorrow .
this isn &apos;t fair .
maybe not , but right now ,
this is what &apos;s supposed to happen to us .
spencer .
i wanted to tell you this in person .
we have been reviewing all of the evidence ,
and we now believe that mona vanderwaal
was not alison &apos;s first victim .
bethany young ?
the da is dropping the charges against you .
the police think alison set you up .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s over , spencer .
it &apos;s all over .
for a minute , i thought
i &apos;d just get on the plane to atlantic city
and fly away , but i didn &apos;t .
i &apos;ve been to atlantic city , you made the right choice .
you know , paige was wrong .
she should have stayed .
i don &apos;t think she was wrong . she got out .
we should all think about getting out of here .
to atlantic city ?
i just said that ...
no , no , not to atlantic city , to anywhere .
i mean , ali &apos;s in jail ,
nobody thinks i killed anybody .
nothing &apos;s keeping us here anymore .
after we graduate , we can go wherever we want to .
ali kept us in this town like we were magnetized .
that &apos;s over .
the spell is broken .
we &apos;ve all got college applications out .
so it &apos;s not too late .
if we can achieve escape velocity ,
we can have a chance at our own actual lives .
no gates , no dams , no barriers .
an actual life .
is that the carnival at st. bridgette &apos;s ?
it &apos;s so beautiful .
no , no , i don &apos;t accept this .
alison is &quot; a , &quot; and alison is in jail .
oh , my god .
they don &apos;t allow fireworks in prison .
no , no , this has to be something
that she set up before they got her , right ?
that &apos;s what it has to be .
