old friends fought .
you knew that julie was in trouble ,
and you chose not to come to me .
new lovers lie .
where did you get it , bree ?
she bought it ? i &apos;m assuming .
uh , yes , at that little antique store down on pearl street .
sorry . we sell furniture .
she must have gotten it somewhere else .
and suspicion was born .
do you know where katherine was
the night that julie was attacked ?
julie mayer was having trouble sleeping .
you see , every time she closed her eyes ,
she dreamt of her neighbor .
they met when she came to tutor his son .
later , a chance encounter at a caf
led to hours of conversation .
he asked to see her again ...
and again ...
and again .
and the next thing julie knew ,
she was having an affair with a married man .
but then , after a close call ,
she came to her senses
and told the man it was over .
unfortunately for julie ,
some men can &apos;t take &quot; no &quot; for an answer .
can i come in ?
what , that &apos;s it ? it &apos;s that simple to you ?
you have to leave now .
come on . let &apos;s just talk about this .
there is nothing to talk about ! just go !
yes , there is ! just come on . talk to me ! huh ?
lynette . hi . what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m just dropping off that band candy
your mom bought from penny .
everything okay ?
yeah , everything &apos;s fine .
um ... mr. bolen was just leaving . right ?
yeah , i guess i was . hey , lynette .
hey , nick .
what was that about ?
what do you mean ?
well , i don &apos;t mean to pry . it &apos;s just ...
when i was walking up , i heard you two arguing .
he &apos;s the guy .
the guy ?
the guy i was ... having the affair with .
no . no !
why did you tell me this ? !
you asked .
why not lie ?
i &apos;m late for work .
i would &apos;ve bought anything .
look , don &apos;t freak out . it &apos;s over .
not for me . now i have to tell your mom !
no , you don &apos;t .
she was pissed when i didn &apos;t tell her
you might be pregnant .
if i don &apos;t tell her about this , i &apos;m dead .
come on , lynette .
i am serious !
she already shot katherine .
now she &apos;s got a taste for blood .
there &apos;s no reason to tell her anything .
i broke it off weeks ago .
then why was he here ?
he wants me to take him back .
threaten to tell his wife .
he doesn &apos;t care . he says he loves me .
oh , honey , you &apos;re smart enough to know that that &apos;s a lie .
right ?
i keep trying to get over him ,
but then he comes over here and he says all this stuff ,
and i ... i just get so confused .
listen to me .
i will handle this .
really ?
and you ... you won &apos;t tell my mom ?
no , i won &apos;t .
thank you .
that night , for the first time in weeks ,
julie mayer would sleep well .
unfortunately ,
lynette scavo would not .
&quot; the fairview homeschooling workbook &quot;
was created to help parents teach their children .
it &apos;s colorful ,
very entertaining ,
a bit challenging
and guaranteed to make teaching fun .
pick that up , or i will knock you into next week !
i hate fractions !
i don &apos;t care ! you still have to learn them !
why ? fractions are boring !
okay . fine .
let me make it more interesting for you .
say i take mrs. doolittle ... you favorite doll ...
and i chop her into thirds . i bury one third in the yard .
i put another third down the garbage disposal .
how much of mrs. doolittle do you have left ?
you &apos;re not gonna hurt her , are you ?
it depends on how you answer the question !
gaby ! can i see you for a sec ?
what is going on ?
i &apos;m teaching math .
by threatening her toys ?
well , maybe teacher &apos;s a little tired , okay ?
it &apos;s not the only thing i have to do around here .
i also have to cook and clean .
okay , i hear you .
it isn &apos;t fair that all this falls on you .
i &apos;ll get you some help .
thank you .
we &apos;ll get a housekeeper .
what ? no , no , no , i &apos;d rather have a tutor .
you &apos;d rather scrubs toilets than teach your daughter ?
well , at least the toilets won &apos;t talk back .
gaby , she just had to leave her school and all her friends .
and now her mother &apos;s gonna abandon her ,
and leave her with some stranger ?
i don &apos;t think so .
no , but--
no &quot; but &quot; s . juanita needs you right now .
you &apos;re doing this .
don &apos;t worry . your doll &apos;s safe .
if i &apos;m gonna chop anything off ,
it &apos;s gonna be something of your daddy &apos;s !
so you &apos;re saying you won &apos;t even talk to her ?
no , we already interviewed mrs. mayfair .
that &apos;s when you thought
danny bolen had attacked julie .
you treated her like a witness .
now you need to treat her like a suspect .
look , miss , we &apos;re not trying to dismiss your concerns ,
but women don &apos;t commit this kind of crime .
they tend to keep at a physical remove
from their victims ...
vehicular assaults , poison .
well , maybe katherine was thinking outside the box .
hey , did you get any mayo ?
yeah .
look , i was skeptical , too , but she does have a motive .
she hates susan .
well , that &apos;s a motive to attack her .
well , maybe katherine saw julie taking out the garbage
and thought it was me .
she mistook you for a 23 @-@ year @-@ old ?
i &apos;m sorry , mrs. delfino , but , uh ,
unless you &apos;ve got actual evidence ,
we &apos;re gonna keep assuming that
this is a random incident ...
one that your daughter thankfully survived .
damn it ! they forgot the pickle !
what is with this place ?
is there anyone here that understands
a woman can be a psycho killer , too ?
ah , maybe i can help .
you want me to take this one ?
have at it .
thank you so much .
so how about i , uh , take a look at your file ?
i will swing by tomorrow ,
and i &apos;ll get your statement then .
great .
well ... it is nice to know that someone
cares about justice more than pickles .
come on , mike .
are you sure you want this case ?
&apos;cause i &apos;ve got a serial killer here that might be more fun .
nah , she and i go way back .
she doesn &apos;t remember me now , but she will .
i wish you hadn &apos;t committed us to this .
why ? they &apos;re our neighbors ,
and they &apos;ve been asking us for weeks .
i &apos;m not a fan of angie bolen . she can be very forward .
i like her . she &apos;s earthy , takes a real interest in people .
yes . last week , she asked me how much my dress cost
and did i still get visits from my aunt flo .
well , i believe that &apos;s a euphemism for--
i know what it means .
by the way , i stopped by that antique store today--
the one where you said you bought that brooch .
i thought i &apos;d get you a replacement
since you gave yours to susan .
but the owner said they don &apos;t sell jewelry there .
just furniture .
well , that &apos;s odd .
i must &apos;ve confused that store
with the jewelry shop on maple street .
yes , i remember now . that &apos;s where i bought it .
hey , look who &apos;s here !
my goodness . another course ?
well , my grandma bombelli always said ,
&quot; if the men can still button their pants ,
dinner ain &apos;t over yet . &quot;
is her braciole amazing or what ?
i have to admit , i &apos;ve never had this before .
and it is quite tasty .
aw , thanks , hon . hang on a sec .
you don &apos;t want to stain that gorgeous blouse .
i &apos;m actually a very neat eater .
oh , hey , when nick here starts twirlin &apos; his pasta ,
nobody &apos;s safe .
i did get some friendly fire from a meatball earlier .
i &apos;m glad we &apos;re finally doing this .
you two are hard to pin down .
well , we &apos;ve been incredibly busy .
oh , i &apos;ll bet , especially since katherine wigged out
and you had to give her the boot .
you know , if you need someone to replace her ,
you could a lot worse than angie .
oh ?
yeah , her grandma bombelli had
the best restaurant in little italy
and taught angie everything she knew .
i mean ...
if you &apos;re lookin &apos; for help .
well , if your food is all this good--
we &apos;re ... not hiring .
sorry .
okay . it &apos;s just a thought .
you sure , bree ?
she said no .
no , i &apos;m just sayin &apos; ... you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re missin &apos; .
nick , she &apos;s had four courses .
she knows what she &apos;s missing .
now zip it .
don &apos;t bite my head off . i &apos;m just tryin &apos; to help .
what , by embarrassing our guests ?
just ignore him , okay ?
it was your idea to cook for her .
thank you ! now they &apos;re gonna think
that i don &apos;t cook for people unless i have an angle .
i am so sorry .
now look at them . they &apos;re wishin &apos; they hadn &apos;t come .
no ! we &apos;re having a lovely time .
no ! we &apos;re thrilled to be here !
perfect ! now you &apos;re makin &apos; our guests lie .
i &apos;m gonna go stir the sauce .
i &apos;ll get more wine .
we &apos;re gonna need it .
uh , just curious , how many more courses ?
three .
orson , i never thought i &apos;d say this to you again ,
but please ... unbutton your pants .
okay .
if you have half a cabbage ,
and someone gives you a quarter cabbage ,
how much cabbage do you have ?
none , because i hate cabbages and i wouldn &apos;t take &apos; em .
fine . they &apos;re balloons .
there &apos;s no such thing as half a balloon .
well , there is a such thing as half an allowance ,
which is what you &apos;re gonna get if you don &apos;t start to focus .
why can &apos;t i just use a calculator ?
&apos;cause you have to know this stuff .
if not , you &apos;re gonna end up
scrubbing other people &apos;s toilets !
sorry .
look , if you finish this page , we &apos;ll go get some ice cream .
how &apos;s that sound ?
i don &apos;t want to have ice cream with you .
i &apos;m gonna get some air .
will you make sure she doesn &apos;t move from the table ?
what do you call this again ?
uh , foie gras mousse .
mmm. tastes so elegant .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s elegant ?
it &apos;s okay .
would you like to sample something else , mr. vitale ?
some salmon en croute or perhaps some coq au vin ?
got anything i can pronounce ?
you don &apos;t need to pronounce it .
you just gotta wipe it off your shirt .
you wanna end up on a plate next to the salmon ,
keep it up .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry we wasted your time .
my husband doesn &apos;t understand elegant food .
he &apos;s an ignoramus .
hey , this ignoramus is throwing you
an anniversary party for 500 people .
500 , you say ?
let &apos;s , um , sit down and figure something out
because i would really love to cater this party .
look , you seem like a nice lady .
it &apos;s just that our guests are comin &apos; in from the bronx .
they don &apos;t know from fancy food .
it &apos;s more of a sausage and peppers crowd . i &apos;m sorry .
i could make you braciole .
you can do braciole ?
yes , and , uh ...
gnocchi and tortelloni and , uh , lasagna verde .
but none of that stuff &apos;s on your menu .
that &apos;s because they &apos;re family recipes
from ... my grandmother bombelli .
you &apos;re italian ? you don &apos;t look it .
papa was irish .
i may get my hair from the o &apos;rourke side ,
but my stomach ...
she &apos;s all bombelli .
if you give me this job ,
i will feed your family my stracotto
till the men can &apos;t button their pants .
now that &apos;s what we &apos;re lookin &apos; for . you &apos;re hired .
ahh ! i feel better .
all right , let &apos;s get back to it .
hold it . you got all these problems right ?
you cheated , didn &apos;t you ? confess !
no , ivana helped me .
who &apos;s ivana ?
that &apos;s me .
we met when you handed me this bucket and rag .
oh. yeah . right .
sorry. uh , you helped her ?
i told her to look at fractions like a big chocolate cake .
the bottom number is the whole thing ,
and the top number represents how many slices .
well , i should &apos;ve known cake
would make everything come into focus .
math is my specialty .
i have a phd in engineering
from the university of bucharest .
but it means nothing in the american job market. so ...
wow . a doctor .
impressive .
oh , the upstairs bathroom has a bunch
of hair stuck in the drain .
can you take care of that ?
sure .
mom , this next page doesn &apos;t make sense . i need help .
uh ... doctor ?
i &apos;m thinking that drain can wait .
nick
hey , lynette ! perfect timing .
i was just thinking about busting open a bottle of wine .
well , actually , i &apos;m here to talk to nick .
i was admiring your roses
and i was hoping you could give me a few pointers .
honey , you hear that ?
people are asking us for gardening tips .
we are officially suburban .
oh , so ... wine ?
uh ... you go ahead .
all right .
thanks , though .
mm @-@ hmm .
so here &apos;s the key ...
you , uh , you cut going away from the bud
at a 45 degree angle--
i know about you and julie .
for god sakes , you &apos;re twice her age .
okay , lynette , this is none of your business .
no offense .
none taken .
but you know who might be offended ? her father .
if karl finds out , he &apos;s gonna come over here
and cut your buds off at a 45 degree angle .
yeah , thanks for the warning .
i mean it .
if you don &apos;t stop bothering julie , you will be sorry .
happy gardening .
wait , hang on a second . hang on . hang ...
wait , julie said i was bothering her ?
did she also tell you that she started this whole thing ?
she came after me .
all right , there are two sides to every story .
yeah , well , your side is married .
look , i tried to resist .
she just wore me down ,
talking about how she &apos;d never met anybody like me ,
she never felt this way before .
she &apos;s been jerking me around since the day we met .
i don &apos;t care ! just leave her alone .
yeah , all right . all right , fine .
if i find out you told anyone about us
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s gonna be sorry .
so like i said , you wanna water the roses
you know , a few times a week .
don &apos;t get anything on the foliage .
that &apos;s how they get diseased . all right ?
hey , thanks , baby .
you okay ?
i think i might know who strangled julie .
hey , good timing . i &apos;m putting dinner on the table .
i thought the housekeeper was supposed to start today .
she did , and she &apos;s fantastic !
and her family escaped from romania
with practically nothing .
well , what were they fleeing from , cleanliness ?
well , i @-@ i didn &apos;t wanna just throw work at her the first day .
we needed time to bond .
okay , so when does she start
bonding with the dishwasher ?
daddy , look what i did ! fractions ! all right !
so mommy taught you how to do fractions .
mommy didn &apos;t . ivana ...
ivana take all the credit myself !
can you believe her ?
after all the work i &apos;ve done ...
let &apos;s go teach you some manners .
so the best i can figure ,
the attack happened around 11 : 30 that night .
now people saw katherine
leaving the wedding in the afternoon ,
and no one saw her again until the next morning .
so ... you have to wonder .
um ... i am sorry
but aren &apos;t you gonna write some of this down ?
you totally don &apos;t remember me , do you ?
oh , my gosh !
no. sorry. uh , can i get a little help ?
denise . denise lapera .
of course !
a little more help , please ?
fairview high .
i used to sit behind you in mr. parsons &apos; english class .
oh , my god ! i am such an idiot !
denise lapeera !
lapera .
lapera .
mr. parsons .
&quot; pit @-@ stain &quot; parsons .
oh , gosh . i wonder what ever happened to him .
yeah , i actually arrested him a few years back .
twice . drunk driving .
he got a little aggressive . i had to use my taser .
part of my was like
&quot; zip ! and that &apos;s for &apos; beowulf &apos; ! &quot;
that &apos;s good times .
oh , good times .
and the good times just keep rolling for you , huh , susan ?
i mean , look , you got a handsome husband
and two beautiful children and a lovely home .
oh. well , how about you , detective lapeera ?
lapera .
lapera .
uh , i , you know , you have done very well for yourself .
professionally , maybe .
but i &apos;m living in my mother &apos;s basement .
i &apos;m sorry .
uh , divorced ?
never married .
dating anyone ?
no , but i did bowl a 179 the other night .
and you &apos;re a detective .
so back to katherine .
uh , is there , you know , anything else
that you would need to know ?
no , i &apos;m good .
i &apos;ll just head over there now and nose around
and see if she has an alibi .
oh , actually , uh , denise , one more thing .
um , this is a very tight @-@ knit community ,
and i &apos;m afraid if katherine finds out that i &apos;m the one
that accused her of this , things could get ugly .
aw , we wouldn &apos;t want that , would we ?
exactly , so maybe you could just say
it was an anonymous tip or something .
sure .
thanks .
oh , say hi to your mom .
yeah , we don &apos;t speak .
oh , look. what a nice gift .
it &apos;s the least i could do to thank you
for that marvelous dinner .
oh , please , we should be thanking you for not walking out
when me and nick started screaming at each other .
oh , it was just one course .
the rest of the meal was extremely quiet .
god , you are so tactful .
you think you can teach me some of that ?
and take away that earthy charm ? i wouldn &apos;t think of it .
listen , angie , i have this friend
coming to town next week , and i would love
to serve her that dinner you made for us ,
if you don &apos;t mind sharing your recipes .
oh , gee , i would love to help , but grandma bombelli
was real strict about not sharing the family recipes .
please ?
this friend just loves good italian food .
take her to piccolino . their food is good .
um ... this friend--
she doesn &apos;t really go to restaurants anymore ,
not since the fire .
people stare , so ...
oh , my god . that &apos;s awful. you know what ?
grandma would want this woman to eat well . hold on .
okay , we got the gnocchi , lasagna verde ,
the tortelloni , the braciole , the stracotto , arancini
and the polenta cake .
but ... i &apos;m making a big exception here ,
so promise you won &apos;t go passing these around .
trust me . i will treat these recipes as if they were my own .
she has been over there a long time , hasn &apos;t she ?
man , are there enough photos of you in this yearbook ?
wow . do you still have this cheerleading outfit ?
mike !
i just thought if you put it on ,
it might jog your memory .
looking at denise &apos;s photo might do the trick .
hey , here she is . yikes .
hair in the &apos; 80s-- what were you girls thinking ?
oh , my god . moose .
too much mousse , if you ask me .
no , the animal . that was her nickname .
oh , god . oh , god .
what &apos;s wrong ?
this is moose lapera .
she was the only girl that hated me in high school .
why ?
i may have mentioned to beth porter
that ... she had a laugh like a moose .
you gave her the nickname ?
no , i just made that comparison .
beth is the one that got the entire school to go ...
whenever she walked by .
and she hates you because of that ?
well , and also ... i kinda stole her boyfriend .
&quot; kind of &quot; ?
she spent all senior year in love with mark malone ,
and they went on , like , one date ,
and mark noticed me and dumped moose to ask me out .
so the guy came after you . wasn &apos;t your fault .
clearly you were never a high school girl .
moose was convinced that i stole mark from her ,
just like katherine is convinced that i--oh , my god !
i sent her over there .
it &apos;s like a meeting of the &quot; i hate susan &quot; club !
what am i gonna do ?
this was a long time ago .
nobody holds a grudge that long .
hey , maybe you &apos;re right . look at this .
i think she might be arresting katherine right now .
that is a perp walk .
she is taking katherine on a perp walk .
looks more like a perp hug .
what is going on ? what-- what is she doing ?
i think she &apos;s showing us how long
someone can hold her grudge
juanita , i was thinking ,
after you and ivana finish your schoolwork ,
would you like to go see a movie with me--
just the two of us
cool ! can we have junior mints for dinner ?
wouldn &apos;t be a movie if you weren &apos;t throwing up candy
on the ride home .
hi . can i help you ?
hola . i &apos;m christina .
from happy housekeeper ?
oh ! oh , there must be some mistake .
uh , our maid is ivana .
i request ivana . where &apos;s ivana ?
my english not so good .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s our new cleaning lady .
gracias por venir .
would you excuse us one moment ? un momento .
what do you mean , new cleaning lady ?
where &apos;s ivana ?
i called the agency and had them send over someone else .
well ... why ?
because ivana sucked ,
and not in that good vacuum sort of way .
hey , cut her some slack . she &apos;s romanian .
okay , when your people are being chased into argentina
by angry cossacks ,
maybe a sparkling toilet isn &apos;t that important .
argentina ?
how about you stick to fractions ,
and i &apos;ll teach juanita geography ?
good bye
gracias .
so how do you feel about teaching math to 7 @-@ year @-@ olds ?
my english ...
not so good .
yeah , i know .
knock , knock !
angie , what are you doing here ?
oh , your shortbread was so good ,
i made you a batch of my pignoli cookies .
how incredibly thoughtful of you .
hey , i smell marinara .
you cooking my food for your friend ?
yes , and i am way behind , so--
oh ! well , let me help you , then ! wow .
you sure got a lot of sauce here .
lot of potatoes , too .
this is all for three people ?
well , with food like yours , who wouldn &apos;t want leftovers ?
&quot; vitale anniversary party - arancino , gnocchi , braciole . &quot;
you were stealing my recipes for a catering job .
i wanted to serve foie gras . the client demanded pasta .
so you come running to me with some sob story
about a burn victim who can only be healed by manicott &apos; ?
i admit that was a bit tacky .
i lit a candle for that woman !
if you think about it , it was a huge compliment .
and the compliment is
that my food is good enough for your business
but i &apos;m not .
i would never say you weren &apos;t good enough .
of course you wouldn &apos;t . you &apos;re tactful .
but you know what ? i &apos;m not , which is why i can say
that you &apos;re a two @-@ faced , condescending bitch
who will never make a nickel
off my dead grandma &apos;s braciole !
but enjoy the cookies !
that &apos;s insane .
i know this is hard for you .
it &apos;s impossible . it couldn &apos;t have been nick .
how can you be so sure ? it was dark .
you told the police you couldn &apos;t see who attacked you .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense . he loves me .
exactly , and you broke up with him .
honey , this is something we have to consider .
well , i can &apos;t consider it , okay ? i just can &apos;t .
julie ... we watched you grow up .
you &apos;re like a daughter to us .
we can &apos;t stand by and do nothing .
so you &apos;re gonna talk to the police
no matter what i say .
i think we have to .
it just couldn &apos;t be him .
you . what are you doing here ?
the agency gave me this address .
please , ivana , i need you to come back .
your husband told the agency
that i am a lousy housekeeper .
you never told him what i was really doing .
the agency almost fired me . you have to leave .
oh , no , no , no ! wait ! wait !
i need you !
juanita needs you .
see ? she needs you . she has a test tomorrow ,
and when i teach her , one of us ends up in tears .
don &apos;t make me teach my baby .
i &apos;m sorry . i have floors to scrub .
forget scrubbing . ivana , you have a gift .
share it with the world , starting with my daughter .
what about the floor ?
you missed a spot .
got a minute ?
this really isn &apos;t a good time .
ooh . gnocchi .
tasty .
don &apos;t patronize me .
angie &apos;s are light as air . mine are like little shot puts .
well , perhaps this will cheer you up .
i went to that jewelry store on maple
and look what i found .
you like it ?
i told you , i don &apos;t have time for this .
you know , it &apos;s odd . i asked them about the first brooch ,
but they said--
oh , for god sakes , orson , would you just stop it ? !
i have told you again and again i want a divorce .
do you think you can change my mind with trinkets ?
i don &apos;t want jewelry . i don &apos;t want romantic gestures .
i want out ! now would you please leave me alone ?
or for god sakes , i swear i &apos;ll throw something at you !
just not one of the gnocchi .
those things could put a man &apos;s eye out .
sorry i &apos;m late !
i had to take down some geezer
in the ten items or less line .
ivana , you should probably split
before carlos gets ho--oh , my !
yeah , i got off work early ,
so i let our cleaning woman go home .
juanita , good job . let &apos;s knock off early today .
okay , daddy .
do you hear that ? i think celia fell down .
gaby .
i &apos;m sorry .
i asked you for help .
i asked for a tutor , and you said no .
because you &apos;re her mother .
you should be able to set aside a few hours each day
to teach your own daughter .
and i will teach her .
there &apos;s so many things i &apos;m gonna teach her--
how to dress , how to put on makeup .
i &apos;ll even show her how to get a boy to notice her .
that &apos;s stuff i know . and we &apos;re gonna have so much fun .
but fractions and grammar and history--
it &apos;s just not my thing , and she knows it .
and then she gets frustrated because i &apos;m frustrated .
and it &apos;s ruining our relationship .
come on , gaby . let &apos;s not exaggerate .
carlos , she turned me down
when i asked to take her for ice cream .
i know . i know .
some moms are made to homeschool ,
and i &apos;m just not one of them .
okay .
i get it. hmm ?
we will figure something else out .
you won &apos;t have to homeschool her anymore .
oh . thank you , carlos .
you &apos;re welcome .
can i keep the housekeeper ?
absolutely not .
i know . i know .
may i come in , please ?
what now ?
um ... i just ...
came to say i &apos;m sorry .
what i did was wrong ,
and those names you called me were harsh
but regrettably accurate .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;d even consider working for me now ,
but if you would , i would be honored
to have you in my kitchen .
well , well , well . you must be drowning over there .
all right , i &apos;m drowning .
and you want me to save you .
please .
first , tell me this .
why don &apos;t you like me ?
i like you .
i find you colorful and--
oh , enough with the tact .
fine . i ...
you make me uncomfortable .
i don &apos;t know how to respond
when someone is as candid as you are .
you say whatever pops in your mind .
you fight with your husband in front of guests--
oh , well , not everyone &apos;s marriage
is as perfect as yours , nancy reagan .
my marriage is not perfect .
oh , come on .
orson and i barely speak to each other anymore .
we haven &apos;t shared a bed in three months .
seriously ?
well , i never would &apos;ve guessed .
that &apos;s the point .
our problems are personal .
we don &apos;t share them with the world .
but you can &apos;t seem to keep anything to yourself .
what ?
trust me , honey .
if there &apos;s one thing i know how to do ,
it &apos;s keep things to myself .
well ... there we are .
you think i &apos;m vulgar .
oh , excuse me . candid .
and i think you &apos;re a tight ass .
but you need help , and i need a job ,
so ... let &apos;s get cookin &apos; .
you mean it ?
thank you , angie .
you &apos;re a lifesaver .
so ... no sex for three months .
what do you do , sit on the dryer ?
okay , now you &apos;re just goading me .
one ham on wheat , extra mayo .
corned beef , lean ,
and of course , an entire jar of pickles .
what &apos;s this about ?
honestly , uh , i don &apos;t think this new detective
is up to the job ,
and i need a couple of seasoned pros
with old school savvy ...
oh , hello , susan .
denise .
why don &apos;t you call me &quot; moose &quot; ? you know you want to .
moose ?
moose ?
denise , i &apos;m glad i ran into you .
i ... i came down here to apologize .
no , you came down here to get me kicked off the case .
okay . one more thing to apologize for .
so look , um , i really am sorry about mark malone ,
but that was ages ago ,
and that guy had &quot; loser &quot; written all over him .
hmm . he &apos;s the c.e.o. of malone enterprises
with a 6 @-@ bedroom home overlooking the lake .
okay . the point is ,
i &apos;d hate for our history to cloud your judgment
in this case .
you think i &apos;m behaving unprofessionally .
well ...
when you were leaving katherine &apos;s house the other day ,
you two did look ... pretty chummy .
oh , well , it turns out we have a lot in common .
we both had boyfriends stolen by you .
i did not steal mike .
katherine just thinks that i did ,
which is why i &apos;m betting she strangled julie .
yeah , well , she couldn &apos;t have ,
because she was on the phone all night with her daughter ,
and the phone records confirm it .
are you sure ?
i know how to do my job , susan .
in fact , i &apos;ve discovered some interesting facts
while investigating this case .
is it true
that on the evening of september 16th
at approximately 11 : 45,
you shot katherine mayfair ?
what ? that was an accident .
and you not reporting it was a crime .
okay , um , let &apos;s not blow this out of proportion .
i hurt you ,
but you &apos;ve gotta get past this . you can &apos;t keep blaming me
for the way that your life turned out .
it &apos;s just ... it &apos;s gonna make you bitter and miserable ,
like katherine .
you need closure , denise .
you have the right to be happy .
and you have the right
to remain silent .
in you go !
hey , susan , you know what this is called ?
closure .
the julie mayer assault ? we &apos;re not on that case anymore .
detective lapera &apos;s handling that .
why ?
well , we have some new information to report .
the detective is out on a call at the moment .
this needs to be checked out right away .
what needs to be checked out right away ?
did you guys ever talk to nick bolen ?
the dad of the kid we arrested .
yeah , yeah , we talked to him .
i &apos;m guessing he didn &apos;t mention that he and julie
were having an affair .
she broke it off right before she was attacked .
no kiddin &apos; .
hey , babe . what &apos;s up ?
good news . i am a working girl .
bree asked me to join her company .
yeah ? hey , that &apos;s great .
hey , you &apos;re still gonna cook for me , right ?
are you kidding ? you &apos;re my guinea pig .
mwah . congrats .
oh , and there was something else i needed to tell you .
oh , right , right , right . cops called .
they wanted to know where you were
the night that julie mayer was strangled .
what ?
why would they be asking about me ?
i guess because you were having an affair with her ?
look , i don &apos;t know what they told you .
they didn &apos;t tell me anything .
i &apos;ve known for weeks .
ange ...
don &apos;t . don &apos;t embarrass yourself ... or me .
you did a stupid thing .
but i know you can &apos;t go anywhere ,
and you know i can &apos;t go anywhere .
so we &apos;re gonna have to get past this .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;ve put you through a lot , so you get this one .
but that &apos;s it .
you know i never attacked her .
and that is why i lied and told the cops
you were with me the entire night .
so we &apos;re okay ?
now we &apos;re okay .
the truth is ,
there &apos;s only so much we can learn from books .
they can &apos;t tell you how to make your wife happy .
they can &apos;t tell you how to appreciate your neighbor .
they can &apos;t tell you
if that man across the street is dangerous .
no , the only way to truly learn is from your mistakes .
of course , if those mistakes land you in jail ,
it might be nice to have a book
