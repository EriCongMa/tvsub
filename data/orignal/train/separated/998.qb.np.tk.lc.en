susan discovered that porter
was the father of julie &apos;s baby .
no , the father will be an adoptive parent
who has gone through extensive interviews
and a background check .
both of you , stop .
i wanna keep it .
then lynette found out ...
no , no , no ! he can &apos;t be having a baby !
gaby took in a houseguest ...
karen kicked me out .
and karen got bad news .
the cancer &apos;s back .
ben &apos;s money problems took a toll ...
let &apos;s get you to the hospital .
and renee stepped in .
normally , i &apos;d never take a check ,
but i know where you live .
orson returned ...
how would you feel about a change of scenery--maine ?
with a plan .
you won &apos;t believe where it &apos;s going to end up .
when it came to raising her children ,
lynette scavo was used to doing things without help .
her husband would often travel on business ...
or rush out to important meetings ...
or sneak out for a game of golf .
but just because lynette
was used to doing everything herself ...
you done yet ?
didn &apos;t mean she liked it .
yes , i &apos;m done .
thank you for your help .
okay , uh , i wanna thank you both for joining me .
i know you &apos;re worried about my decision to be a single father .
no , not worried . more like panicked and terrified .
well , i &apos;m here to let you know that as of today ,
i &apos;ve got everything under control .
i got a job .
just working in a restaurant , but it &apos;s decent pay ,
and there &apos;s health insurance for me and the baby .
well , that is great news .
l @-@ lynette , don &apos;t you want to tell our son that &apos;s great news ?
i &apos;m waiting for the &quot; but . &quot;
there doesn &apos;t have to be a &quot; but . &quot;
it &apos;s porter . there &apos;s always a &quot; but . &quot;
but ... they don &apos;t exactly provide child care .
at a restaurant ? that &apos;s so weird .
they usually have a whole play area
between the knife block and the deep fryer .
so i &apos;ll need a little help with the baby .
how much help ?
i don &apos;t know . eight hours ...
a day ... every day until ...
she turns 18 ?
no .
she could be super smart and end up going to college at 15 .
aw , sweetie , she &apos;s not gonna be super smart .
lynette .
porter , i &apos;m sorry . i am not gonna keep telling you
what a bad idea raising this baby is .
you &apos;re a grownup and you &apos;ve made your own decision ,
and i &apos;m even starting to make my peace with it .
but ?
but i can &apos;t raise her for you .
we--we--we can barely take care of this one .
yeah .
wait . wait . where--where did she go ?
i thought you were watching her .
well , it &apos;s your house .
i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re gonna have to make other arrangements .
i found her !
wow . i don &apos;t know what i was thinking ,
expecting you to care about my baby .
i mean , you &apos;re only the grandmother .
i am happy to be her grandmother .
i will fill her room with stuffed animals .
i will feed her ice cream behind your back .
i will spoil her like nobody &apos;s business .
but when it comes to the heavy lifting , i am done .
or will be very shortly .
okay . i see where you &apos;re coming from .
i guess i &apos;ll have to find some stranger
to watch over little baby lynette .
lynette ?
you were gonna name your daughter after me ?
that &apos;s incredibly touching .
it changes nothing .
yes , lynette scavo had raised her children without much help ...
here you go . practice .
and she was determined that porter do the same .
orson hodge had a plan .
he was determined to reclaim the heart of a woman ...
whose loss he had never gotten over .
he loved her so deeply that he was willing to be patient ...
and obsess over every detail
until at last , the moment arrived
when she was just within reach .
okay , open .
what is this ?
it &apos;s a little book of inspiration
i put together for you .
i wanted to show you some pictures of my cottage in maine .
it &apos;s right on the coast . look . see ? there &apos;s the lighthouse .
oh ! these photographs are breathtaking .
it &apos;s even more beautiful in person ,
when you hear the foghorn and you ...
you breathe in the sea air .
oh , i feel it already . hmm .
oh , orson , i can &apos;t tell you how happy this makes me .
this is exactly what i need right now .
absolutely . you deserve a break
after all that ghastly business you &apos;ve been through lately .
yeah , the murder , the investigation ,
all those chilling letters you received .
letters ?
yes , the letter you received after the murder
and the one after chuck vance was killed .
i never told you about the second letter .
that &apos;s right . i heard about it from lynette .
you talked to lynette about the letters ?
yes . the other day ,
when she came over with the girls .
personally , i thought it was very indiscreet of her ,
but , well ...
yet another example of how those women can &apos;t be trusted .
oh , let me show you this one .
it &apos;s my favorite .
that patch of dirt is your favorite ?
fresh @-@ tilled soil in a raised bed ,
overlooking the ocean .
the perfect place for you to plant a garden .
oh , orson , i can &apos;t remember when i &apos;ve been this excited .
you have truly thought of everything , haven &apos;t you ?
let &apos;s hope so , darling .
and our doppler radar will be tracking
those scattered showers
as they move from eastern pennsylvania
right into the western pennsylvania area .
now when we come--
i could hear that at the store !
oh , no . one of your girls having a birthday ?
i can only imagine them on cake .
no . this is for carlos . he &apos;s coming home thursday .
you got a bottle of champagne for a guy getting out of rehab ?
what , they were all out of opium ?
no , this is for me .
this whole rehab thing has been very stressful .
so this is his big homecoming ,
watching you get loaded ?
and a balloon .
that guy puts up with a lot from you .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
why don &apos;t you think of someone other that yourself
just once in your life ?
you &apos;re right . it &apos;s horrible here .
so why don &apos;t you just walk out the front door ?
believe me , i would if i had anyplace else to go .
well , as the balloon tells us ,
carlos is coming home soon .
so what &apos;s your plan ?
i thought we &apos;d watch the basketball game ,
maybe do a little grilling .
carlos always liked my tri @-@ tip .
well , you know who else likes your tri @-@ tip ? karen .
yeah , she does .
i &apos;m talking about steak , roy !
isn &apos;t it time you two patched things up ?
send her some flowers . make nice .
i tried all that .
if she wants me back , she knows where to find me .
now after the break ,
we &apos;ll answer all your burning questions
about barometric pressure , so make sure you stick around .
how &apos;d it go with julie ?
made it to the train with time to spare .
i think she was eager to get back to school .
i was sort of hoping she &apos;d change her mind
and come back with you .
&quot; guess what , mom ? i decided to stay . &quot;
well , give her some time . you never know .
i think i know .
porter ? is everything okay ?
no . everything pretty much sucks .
i thought i had a job ,
but my mom says it &apos;s not good enough .
so i wrote up a resume .
well , this looks great .
i mean , any boss would be lucky to have you .
i mean , you &apos;re young , energetic .
you had a paper route
and you &apos;re &quot; proficient in martial arts , &quot;
though not proficient in spelling it .
what was the job that your mom said wasn &apos;t good enough ?
waiting tables at the carlyle .
i mean , i know it sounds kinda lame ,
but it &apos;s a stepping @-@ stone .
i &apos;d take classes , learn about the business ...
try to work my way into management .
or even own my own restaurant , just like my parents used to .
wow , porter , that sounds like an actual plan ,
and a good one .
yeah . there &apos;s just one problem .
it doesn &apos;t have day care .
you should take that job .
what will i do with the baby ?
well , lucky for you , you happen to be looking
at fairview &apos;s finest day care provider .
porter , me . i &apos;m the day care .
when the baby is born ,
you just drop her off with me whenever you need .
i will spoil the heck out of her .
you don &apos;t mind being stuck with a baby all day ?
it &apos;s a baby . who could be stuck ?
my mother , for one .
well , for me , it &apos;s a dream come true .
honestly , you would be doing me a favor .
thank you , mrs. delfino .
oh , you know what ? you &apos;re gonna be raising my daughter &apos;s child .
i think it &apos;s about time you started calling me &quot; susan . &quot;
or better yet , &quot; grandma . &quot;
no . susan .
son of a bitch !
what are you doing ?
i ... just noticed you had some flowers delivered ,
and i was snooping to see who they were from .
you wanna know who ?
no .
they &apos;re from roy ! he wants you back !
i just saw you cutting those roses from bree &apos;s garden .
no , you didn &apos;t . you &apos;re old . you can &apos;t see anything .
you &apos;ve got clippers in your pocket .
you have clippers in your pocket !
your finger &apos;s bleeding .
your finger &apos;s bl--
all right , can i just come in ?
come on .
look , roy may be too proud to send flowers himself ,
but he misses you .
whatever .
why are you being like this ?
just get over your silly fight and take him back .
he &apos;s crazy about you .
really ? then how come you &apos;re over here and not him ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m kinda to blame for this ?
i fed the flames of your little spat
because , let &apos;s face it , i &apos;m selfish .
my girls were out of control ,
and roy &apos;s a genius at scaring the crap out of kids .
but now carlos is coming back ,
so i &apos;m all about you two being lovebirds again .
save your breath , gaby . it &apos;s not gonna happen .
what &apos;s going on with you two ?
you know , none of your damn business !
now take your stolen flowers and your clippers and ...
karen , what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing .
i &apos;m on new medication . sometimes i get a little light @-@ headed .
you don &apos;t look so good .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m gonna go and lie ...
lie down .
karen !
karen ! oh , my god ! oh , my god !
okay .
hi . i need an ambulance right away .
4358 wisteria lane .
hey , guys .
whatcha doing ?
i &apos;m helping mrs. delfino paint the nursery .
nursery ?
it &apos;s a room where babies live .
yes , thank you . why would susan need a nursery ?
you didn &apos;t tell her ?
i volunteered to look after the baby
so porter could start that new restaurant job .
yeah . he said you didn &apos;t want to be stuck taking care of her
all the time ,
and i &apos;m thrilled to do it .
that &apos;s ... really nice of you .
and of course it goes without saying that you are welcome
to come over and play anytime with my granddaughter .
our granddaughter .
uh , sorry .
oh , mom . i @-@ i wanted to ask ,
can we take the old bassinet ?
my bassinet ? the one all five of you kids slept in ?
yeah . that &apos;s why i thought it was cool .
now my kid gets to sleep in it .
doesn &apos;t it make you want to cry ?
yeah . yeah , it does .
renee .
what are you doing here ?
learning ten new ways to cook kale .
and letting you know your financial troubles are over .
what do you mean ?
i met with your loan shark--
a sentence i never thought i &apos;d be saying--
and i settled your account .
all you have to worry about now is getting better .
i told you i didn &apos;t want you to do that .
i think the words you &apos;re looking for are &quot; thank you . &quot;
i &apos;m serious . i didn &apos;t want you to get involved in this .
look , if you and i are gonna keep hanging out ,
there &apos;s something you need to know about me .
i do what i want .
thank you .
but i want to be perfectly clear .
i @-@ i will be paying you that money back .
oh , i know .
and it &apos;s probably gonna take a while .
good thing i &apos;m not going anywhere .
it could be years .
shh . just lie there and look pretty .
uh , come in !
and don &apos;t be an ax murderer !
hey , kids , dad &apos;s home !
what &apos;s going on , tom ? kinda busy right now .
actually , that is why i am here .
parker , penny , you guys around ?
hey , guys .
hey , dad .
go pack your bags .
i &apos;ve tried that , tom . they come back .
i figured i &apos;d take &apos; em off your hands for the rest of spring break .
oh , we &apos;re going to your place ?
yeah , yeah , yeah !
cool !
and you already got plenty of stuff there already ,
so pack light !
this is actually happening ?
you &apos;re taking the kids for an entire week ?
well , um , after our talk with porter ,
i got to thinking that you never really get any time to yourself .
and when i was out of town ,
you had the kids for weeks .
so ... i owe ya .
if we weren &apos;t separated , the things i &apos;d do to you ...
anyway , uh , thank you .
it &apos;ll be much easier getting things done around here
when it &apos;s just me and the baby .
no , no , no . i &apos;m taking paige , too .
well , who &apos;s gonna watch her while you &apos;re at work ?
jane .
she hasn &apos;t taken care of a baby in forever .
she &apos;s--she &apos;s really looking forward to it .
okay , that &apos;s really generous .
and here comes the herd .
later , mom .
wait , wait . give me a hug .
bye . all right . love you .
have a good time . i love you .
have a good time . mwah !
i love you , mom .
i love you , too .
so what are you gonna do with all this time to yourself ?
oh , that is a problem i look forward to solving .
bye , paige . thank you !
i spoke with your doctor , and i know .
what ?
doctors aren &apos;t allowed to talk about patients &apos; conditions .
well , they can if you &apos;re family , mom .
why didn &apos;t you tell anyone the cancer &apos;s back ?
because this time , i ain &apos;t gonna beat it .
oh , you don &apos;t know that .
yeah , i do .
so this why you &apos;ve been pushing roy away .
look at my smart daughter , piecing it together .
he doesn &apos;t know about any of it ?
no , and he &apos;s not going to .
but this is a scary thing .
maybe you should let him help you .
why , so he can be miserable , too ?
karen !
roy went through this when his first wife died .
i &apos;m not putting him through it again .
gaby , i &apos;m begging you .
don &apos;t do this to him .
just don &apos;t tell him .
oh ! you know what we need here ?
over the crib , a mobile with twinkly little butterflies .
those were julie &apos;s favorite .
twinkly butterflies .
and , you know , we could put her name on the wall
in big , bright letters .
do you have a name yet ?
i was actually thinking about &quot; lynette . &quot;
for a baby ?
let me think about that .
oh ! you know what else we could do ?
a mural . like , winnie the pooh ,
and his head is stuck in the honey pot .
i brought you guys some coffee ,
but it sounds like one of you doesn &apos;t need it .
oh , i &apos;m not caffeinated .
i &apos;m just high on baby .
is there any sugar ?
uh , in the kitchen .
that baby is gonna feel right at home here .
oh , well , that &apos;s why i &apos;m doing this .
uh @-@ huh . are you gonna keep julie &apos;s bed ?
well , she was here first .
and besides , i mean , if she-- if she does come back ,
she &apos;ll need a place to stay .
right . so when julie comes to visit ,
she &apos;ll be sleeping 4 feet away from
the baby she doesn &apos;t want .
think i should move julie &apos;s bed ?
i think you should do whatever makes you happy .
hon , did you find the sugar ?
that &apos;s what i was looking for .
lets just hope the baby takes after julie .
this is the kind of thing that chaps my ass .
if marmaduke ate my pillow ,
i &apos;d shoot him right in the head .
hey , roy ?
no , gaby .
i wouldn &apos;t actually shoot a dog . it was a joke .
i just realized the other day ,
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever heard you talk about your first wife .
miriam ?
i didn &apos;t even know her name .
miriam .
how long were you guys married ?
39 years .
she died 2 weeks before our 40th anniversary .
oh , my god . cancer , right ?
brain .
son of a bitch , that kind .
a real son of a bitch .
that must have been the worst thing
you ever went through .
you &apos;d think .
wait , are you saying it wasn &apos;t ?
sounds weird .
it--it &apos;s hard to understand .
i wanna understand .
okay .
when you love somebody , love them a long time ,
you get lazy .
you figure they know it ,
so you stop saying it so much , stop showing it .
yeah .
but when you know you &apos;re gonna lose &apos; em ,
that they won &apos;t be there to hear you say it ...
oh , boy , you make damn sure they know it
every second of every day .
i &apos;m so sorry i brought it up .
nah . these ?
i earned &apos; em . i was there for miriam .
i told her everything i needed to tell her ,
held her hand when she was scared .
nah , these don &apos;t bother me at all .
oh , roy . i made a promise to someone ,
but i &apos;m gonna have to break it .
renee . it &apos;s so good to see you again .
a loan shark and a jehovah witness ?
not a combo you see often .
what ?
i &apos;m kind of embarrassed to admit this ,
but i &apos;m a terrible bookkeeper .
the cheque you owe me to pay off your boyfriend &apos;s loan ,
i had the amount wrong .
oh , so you &apos;re here to give me a refund ?
not exactly .
i really like this house .
tell me , what does fire insurance cost
for a place like this ?
okay , why don &apos;t you pick up your violin case
and drive your big cadillac back
to the &quot; godfather &quot; movie you crawled out of ?
you are not gonna intimidate me .
you sure about that ?
it &apos;s how i make my living , and business is good .
ah , i get it .
you see the sweet suburban neighborhood and think ,
&quot; i can push those people around . &quot;
well , let me tell you something .
i do not come from a place like this .
you got all you &apos;re gonna get . we &apos;re done .
i &apos;m the one that decides when we &apos;re done .
see ya around .
is that everything ?
i think so .
have you taken one last look down the lane ,
fixed an image in your mind ?
why ? we &apos;ll only be gone for a month .
will we ? something tells me that once you taste
one of those delicious maine lobster rolls ,
you &apos;ll never want to come back .
aren &apos;t we getting ahead of ourselves ?
promise me you &apos;ll keep an open mind .
fine . mind open .
this is gonna sound silly ,
but you know what i &apos;m most excited about ?
what ?
we finally get to wear those hats i bought
for that alaskan cruise we never got to take .
jiminy christmas . i left mine at home .
orson !
we &apos;ll buy another one .
but it won &apos;t be the same thing . i had them monogrammed ,
and i always imagined us wearing them
on some wonderful adventure together .
oh , that &apos;s all right .
we &apos;ll just stop and get it from your apartment .
my apartment ?
we don &apos;t have time for it .
don &apos;t be silly . it &apos;s on the way .
and besides , most people don &apos;t get to the airport
four hours before their flight .
no ! no , we can &apos;t .
do you know how long it takes
to go through security in a wheelchair ?
certainly not four hours .
bree , please .
orson , is something wrong ?
no . no .
you &apos;re trembling .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s--it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s just , you know me and punctuality .
well , this is hardly the way to start
that relaxing vacation you &apos;ve been promising me .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry , dear .
apology accepted .
now let &apos;s make that
the last time we quibble on this trip .
now we &apos;re off to your apartment .
lynette , porter &apos;s not here .
no , i know .
i just felt bad you were doing all the work on the nursery ,
so i freed up some time in my schedule to help .
you know , painting , moving furniture , whatever you need .
uh , actually , we already finished .
oh . can i see it ?
of course . uh , sure . follow me .
i know pink is a little traditional ,
but then i found
this black and white bedding for the bassinet i just love .
makes it feel like a little french girl &apos;s room ,
don &apos;t you think ?
who &apos;s sophie ?
oh ! uh , that &apos;s what porter decided to name the baby .
uh @-@ huh .
porter decided to name the baby after your mother ?
he did ask me for some suggestions .
interesting . he told me he was naming her lynette .
i know , but ...
baby lynette ?
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
oh , nothing . it &apos;s just , &quot; lynette &quot; is so ...
you .
really ?
well , yeah .
and you have set the bar so high on that name .
do you want to burden a tiny little baby
with trying to live up to that ?
and nobody thought i &apos;d be interested
in hearing about this name change ?
oh , my gosh .
are you upset about this ?
oh . i thought you were into being the hands @-@ off grandma .
well , i &apos;m trying to get my son to stand on his own two feet ,
and i guess i didn &apos;t count on you being the pushy grandma .
i guess your definition of &quot; pushy &quot;
is being helpful and wanting to get involved .
oh , i wanna be involved . it &apos;s my granddaughter , too .
well , i don &apos;t see you setting up a nursery in your house .
oh , well , maybe i will . there &apos;s just one thing i need .
lynette , give that back !
no .
porter wants it here .
he says it pulls the whole room together .
oh , yeah , &apos; cause porter has such a keen eye for design .
what is going on ? what &apos;s wrong ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
you &apos;re calling lynette &quot; sophie , &quot;
you &apos;re making my son a waiter ,
and you &apos;re trying to turn my granddaughter
into a french girl . that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong !
okay , that doesn &apos;t make any sense ,
and it &apos;s incredibly petty .
well , not as petty as trying to steal somebody &apos;s grandchild !
my first visit to your apartment .
i must admit , i &apos;m a bit ashamed i never came by before .
yes , well , truth be told ,
i &apos;m a bit ashamed of how modest it is .
so if it &apos;s all the same , i &apos;d prefer it if you wait out here .
i &apos;ll just be a minute .
absolutely not .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s perfectly charming .
actually , it &apos;s also a mess .
there , i said it . oh , what you must think of me .
orson , i know you .
a &quot; mess &quot; means you haven &apos;t
fluffed the sofa pillows today .
now come on . let &apos;s get you that hat .
oh , hell &apos;s bells .
what ?
i seem to have forgotten my key .
oh , dear .
sometimes i think i &apos;d forget my head
if it weren &apos;t attached to my body .
of course , then i wouldn &apos;t need to get my hat .
the manager has a master key .
would you mind running down to the office to get it ?
of course not . i &apos;ll be back in a sec .
orson ? i &apos;ve looked evewhere and i can &apos;t find the manager .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m such a muddle head .
i forgot that i keep a spare key in the pouch .
it &apos;s one of the good things about being in a wheelchair .
it &apos;s like having a mobile purse .
after you .
what a lovely place .
and , of course , your pillows are perfectly plumped .
it served its purpose .
and now ...
on to new adventures .
you look very dashing .
thank you .
uh , let &apos;s not dillydally .
we--we still have a plane to catch .
oh , we--and we must stop by a newsstand in the terminal .
the novel i &apos;m reading is simply dreadful .
oh , and i know how much you despise airplane food .
perhaps we can pick up a little bite for you as well .
bree ?
it was you ?
you did it ?
you wrote the letters ?
oh , my god .
you killed chuck .
yes .
for you .
what ?
he was going to arrest you .
i had to do something to stop him .
everything i did , bree , was to protect you .
protect me ?
how was writing the letters supposed to protect me ?
they tormented me , almost drove me to suicide .
well , i &apos;m sorry it went that far .
but i knew i had no chance of winning you back
unless i could isolate you from those awful friends of yours .
so i wrote the letters
knowing those women would turn against you ,
and they did .
but why would you want to turn them against me ?
because as long as they were in your life ,
i knew i would always be a distant second ,
and that wasn &apos;t going to be good enough for me !
not this time !
i had to have you all to myself .
that &apos;s how much i love you .
you &apos;re insane .
bree .
bree , we both know what it means to commit a crime
for the greater good .
do not compare yourself to me !
i was protecting people i love .
you were only pursuing your own selfish desires .
no , i did it for both of us !
you took advantage of me
at the darkest moment of my life .
you &apos;re a sick , pathetic man ,
and i know that someday you will pay for your sins .
bree , don &apos;t go ! you &apos;re everything to me !
well , you are nothing to me .
and i never wanna see you again .
you mind if i come in ?
sure , but i &apos;ve already been screamed at
by one scavo today ,
so can we keep it civil ?
if this is about susan , you can save your breath .
oh , come on , lynette .
i know how much you guys care about each other .
hey , you wanna have sex with me ?
that &apos;d really piss her off .
uh , i &apos;m going to pass on that , but thanks .
okay .
i don &apos;t understand why she &apos;s so mad at me .
she said she wanted nothing to do with porter &apos;s baby .
can i tell you a little secret ?
that was her first reaction to all five of our kids .
oh , i don &apos;t believe that .
i mean , she is a great mom .
none of this makes any sense .
now we &apos;re gettin &apos; somewhere .
i just never thought my life would end up like this .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m turning into white trash .
lynette , i come from white trash .
you are nowhere near that .
really ?
i &apos;m separated ,
my kid is having a baby out of wedlock ,
i &apos;m getting into public fights ...
i &apos;m two weeks away
from having a washing machine on the porch .
meanwhile , susan &apos;s getting everything she wants .
yeah , i don &apos;t think susan &apos;s life
is going the way she &apos;d hoped , either .
all i know is , she &apos;s the one over there
painting a nursery for our grandchild .
yeah ...
with your son ,
not her daughter .
that &apos;s the thing about lynette .
she always complains that she has to do everything herself .
but god help you if you try to do anything for her .
i have a bruised tailbone to prove it .
i made the same mistake as you .
and i was married to her . i should know .
what did you do ?
i took the kids off her hands for a week .
and she was fine at first .
then she started calling every ten minutes
to remind me to give paige her medicine
or to make sure that parker wore his retainer .
she needs to be needed .
exactly .
and given what i &apos;ve been going through ,
i kinda get that .
yeah .
so if you could , susan , cut her a break .
she &apos;s lost a lot .
i don &apos;t want her losing you , too .
i think that &apos;s why she &apos;s going so overboard
on this nursery thing .
she hopes it &apos;ll get julie excited about the baby ,
maybe bring her back .
you know , you &apos;re taking all my anger away ,
and that &apos;s not gonna leave me anything .
yeah , it will .
it &apos;ll leave you your friend .
... many holes in the metro area .
ladies and gentlemen ...
what you won &apos;t do to get out of being married to me .
aw , crap .
i knew i couldn &apos;t trust the jumping bean
to keep her mouth shut .
these are for you .
rushing things a bit , don &apos;t ya think ?
not dead yet .
no , but i &apos;m about to kill ya .
what the hell were you thinking ?
i didn &apos;t want to put you through this again .
karen , i married you for better or worse .
we had the better , and now ...
well , what if i say i don &apos;t want you here ?
you &apos;re an old lady . what are you gonna do about it ?
i &apos;m scared .
i know .
hey , renee .
hey , uh , just wanted to let you know
that ben &apos;s test results just got back ,
and , uh , everything is normal . he &apos;s getting out tomorrow .
that great news .
oh , and i got more .
we &apos;re back together , and i have you to thank for that .
well , you don &apos;t have to give me credit .
uh , yeah , i do ,
because if he breaks my heart again ,
i &apos;m giving you the blame .
hey , did you say you &apos;re at the hospital ?
yeah .
is anybody staying at your place ?
no . why ?
i just thought i saw a light turn on .
it &apos;s probably nothing , but i &apos;ll go check it out .
what the hell are you doin &apos; ?
some people use voice mail .
i prefer to deliver my messages in person .
so ...
why don &apos;t you just move along before you get involved ?
too late .
i keep forgetting you &apos;re the tough guy around here .
well ...
i don &apos;t want any trouble .
i don &apos;t ever wanna see you again .
then you should have killed me .
hang on .
wait , wait , wait .
surprise ! welcome home !
whoa ! who did this ?
i did .
really ?
&apos;cause when i got home from prison ,
all you left me was a post @-@ it note on the fridge ,
and it said , &quot; take out the trash , ex @-@ con . &quot;
well , i don &apos;t want to take you for granted anymore .
you sound like you actually mean that .
what &apos;s going on ?
karen &apos;s cancer is back ...
and it &apos;s bad .
that &apos;s why she threw roy out .
oh , god .
kind of makes you think .
i mean , when we got married ,
i thought that was the finish line .
but it &apos;s not . death is . no one told us that .
yeah , they did .
at our wedding , they said ,
&quot; till death do us part . &quot;
oh , carlos , please .
i had four glasses of champagne before the ceremony .
i almost married your uncle .
oh , come on , gaby .
i mean , the idea that we might die someday
must have at least crossed your mind .
i just never thought about what it really means ,
that one of us is gonna die ,
and the other one &apos;s gonna live through it .
and if it &apos;s you who &apos;s first ?
i don &apos;t think i can do it .
yes , you can .
you &apos;re one of the bravest people i know .
look at what we &apos;ve been through this year .
you &apos;ve been my rock .
i have ?
well ...
you and scotch .
but from now on , just you .
thank you .
and , hey , if it makes you feel any better ,
you can always take the easy way out--die first .
what &apos;s going on with the name ?
you didn &apos;t change it to &quot; sop , &quot; did you ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s even worse than &quot; lynette . &quot;
&quot; lynette &quot; isn &apos;t so bad .
thanks for that .
you can count it on .
thank you for all the rest of this .
so you need anything ?
the nail holes need to be spackled .
mm . i &apos;m on it .
hello ? bree , it &apos;s orson .
listen to me .
don &apos;t you ever call my house again .
i can assure you this is the last you &apos;ll hear from me .
what do you want , orson ?
i &apos;ve been thinking about what you said , and you &apos;re right .
the sins that have been committed are so reprehensible
that a sacrifice must be made .
the ultimate sacrifice .
do not consider suicide .
that would only be adding more sins to your list .
you don &apos;t have to judge , bree .
someone else will do that for you .
good @-@ bye ... forever .
yes .
there are times when we all could use a little help .
when our generosity has been repaid with cruelty ...
when our behavior has filled us with regret ...
and when our future has become terribly uncertain .
but then there are those who are past the point of help ,
and in their wake ,
