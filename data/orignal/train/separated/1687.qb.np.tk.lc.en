water demon .
ice dragon .
lesser warlord of ka &apos;a .
not so fast .
infinite sheldon .
infinite sheldon ?
yes , infinite sheldon defeats all other cards
and does not violate the rule against homemade cards
because i made it at work .
do you understand why people don &apos;t want to play with you ?
no ...
although it &apos;s a question i &apos;ve been pondering since preschool .
hey , your copy of science magazine was in my mailbox .
oh , thanks . mm @-@ hmm .
check it out , all about planets this month .
that &apos;s an atom .
agree to disagree .
that &apos;s what i love about science .
there &apos;s no one right answer .
so ...
you and zack again , huh ?
yeah , yeah , me and zack again .
were we here earlier ?
okay , we should , we should go .
ah , not yet .
i want to talk science with the science dudes .
oh , and the science dudes want to talk science with you .
what do you want to talk about ,
rocks , dinosaurs , our friend the beaver ?
you know , i saw this great thing on the discovery channel .
turns out that if you kill a starfish ,
it &apos;ll just come back to life .
was the starfish wearing boxer shorts ?
because you might have been watching nickelodeon .
no , i &apos;m almost sure that it was the discovery channel .
it was a great show .
they also said dolphins might be smarter than people .
they might be smarter than some people .
maybe we can do an experiment to find out .
that &apos;s easy enough .
we &apos;d need a large tank of water , a hoop to jump through ,
and a bucket of whatever bite @-@ sized treats you find tasty .
i don &apos;t get it .
a dolphin might .
oh , i see .
you guys are inferring that i &apos;m stupid .
that &apos;s not correct .
we were implying it .
you then inferred it .
let &apos;s go .
you know , for a group of guys
who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied ,
you can be real jerks .
shame on all of you .
what the hell did i do ?
you laughed .
do you think penny &apos;s right ?
were we bullying zack ?
no , i know bullying .
he left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants @-@ free .
and nobody drew a penis on his forehead .
that happened to you ?
first day of cricket camp .
they drew it so the testicles were my eyes .
i don &apos;t know , i think we might owe the guy an apology .
so go apologize .
why me ?
you started it , we just piled on .
what would i even say ?
zack , i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re stupid .
have a milk dud .
a milk dud ?
yeah , milk duds , with their self @-@ deprecating name
and remarkably mild flavor ,
are the most apologetic of the boxed candies .
i got a better idea .
we &apos;re all responsible .
i say we all go .
come on , who &apos;s with me ?
free comic books to anyone who comes with me .
i might get punched . you really want to miss that ?
junior mints are pretty apologetic .
you &apos;re embarrassing yourself .
penny .
what ?
yeah , we came to talk to zack . hey , zack .
what do you want ?
listen , the stuff we were saying before ,
we were just kidding around .
no , you weren &apos;t .
you were making fun of me .
come on , that &apos;s what we do .
we give each other a hard time .
hey , sheldon ,
you look like a praying mantis .
that &apos;s very hurtful .
see ?
i don &apos;t know , it still wasn &apos;t very nice .
milk dud ?
oh , i love milk duds .
okay , we &apos;re cool .
junior mints .
you guys want to come in and have a beer ?
uh , we &apos;re on our way to the comic book store .
leonard &apos;s buying .
really ?
i haven &apos;t been to a comic book store
in literally a million years .
literally ?
literally a million years ?
don &apos;t .
you want to go with &apos; em ?
no .
okay , see you later .
wait ,
w @-@ w @-@ w @-@ wait , you &apos;re ditching me to go look at comic books ?
are you mad at me ?
i &apos;m not happy .
milk dud ?
wow , this place is awesome .
where do they keep the archies ?
in the bedrooms of ten @-@ year @-@ old girls , where they belong .
oh , no , you &apos;re thinking old @-@ school archie .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated now .
like , there &apos;s two universes ,
and archie &apos;s married to betty in one
and veronica in the other .
midge is even breaking up with moose .
no .
about time , right ?
hey . you guys finally chip in for a bodyguard ?
uh , no . oh , this is zack .
he &apos;s a friend of ours .
zack , this is stuart .
he owns the store .
wow , lucky you .
yeah , i work 70 hours a week
and average $ 1.65 an hour .
sweet .
is that sarcasm ?
no , it &apos;s an indictment of the american education system .
the archies are over here .
yippee .
so are you guys coming to my new year &apos;s eve costume party ?
of course .
we &apos;re coming as the justice league of america .
switching it up from last year
when we came as the justice league of america .
to that point ,
it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity
to finally snare best group costume
if we shore up our weak link ,
which is clearly leonard as superman .
hey , i got new boots this year .
guaranteed to add three inches .
that &apos;s sad .
let &apos;s ask ourselves :
is there anyone we know
who would make a more manly and convincing son of krypton ?
than leonard in high @-@ heeled boots ?
howard &apos;s mother in high @-@ heeled boots ?
i was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there
moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of betty and veronica .
zack ?
he is the only person we know with actual muscles .
you can &apos;t replace me with zack .
why not ? penny did it .
yeah , she seems happier .
why wouldn &apos;t we be ?
score .
i got an archie , betty and veronica ,
and a jughead .
all set for my weekend number twos .
congratulations .
zack , how would you like to be superman ?
i don &apos;t kow . sounds like a lot of responsibility .
fine . if zack &apos;s gonna be superman ,
i want to be green lantern .
but i &apos;m green lantern .
you can be aquaman .
i don &apos;t want to be aquaman .
he sucks .
he sucks underwater .
he sucks fish pee .
excuse me ,
i believe aquaman uses his telepathic powers
to request the fish do their business elsewhere .
hey , babe .
i &apos;m still mad at you .
well , you won &apos;t be when you hear the great news .
what great news ?
we &apos;re going to a costume party
at the comic book store on new year &apos;s eve ,
and you get to be wonder woman .
complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth .
invisible plane sold separately .
wait , why me ?
wh @-@ why can &apos;t your girlfriend be wonder woman ?
she and her lab team are under quarantine .
seems at the christmas party they were doing jell @-@ o shots
out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever .
okay , what about your friend amy ?
amy farrah fowler doesn &apos;t believe in wearing costumes .
she isn &apos;t the free spirit i am .
okay , well , forget it .
i &apos;m not spending my new year &apos;s eve
at a comic book store wearing a wonder woman costume .
he says he &apos;ll wear it if you &apos;ll be aquaman .
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re going to be late .
i &apos;m pacing nervously .
you &apos;re jogging .
this is how the flash paces .
just chill out , sheldon .
i &apos;m not sheldon . i &apos;m the flash .
and now i &apos;m going to the grand canyon
to scream in frustration .
i &apos;m back .
i &apos;m batman .
oh , i hardly think so .
the real caped crusader calls his crime @-@ fighting cohorts
when he &apos;s running late .
i had to walk .
i couldn &apos;t get raj on the back of my scooter .
i &apos;ve said this before , and i &apos;ll say it again .
aquaman sucks .
look up in the sky . it &apos;s a bird . it &apos;s a plane .
i forget the rest .
all right . let &apos;s get this thing over with .
i &apos;m sorry .
but in what universe is wonder woman blonde ?
relax . no one &apos;s going to be looking at her hair .
ow !
i mean ,
ow .
hold on . the costume came with a black wig . where is it , babe ?
no . i &apos;m not wearing it . it looks stupid .
come on . we &apos;re trying to win a contest here .
forget it . i &apos;m not wearing the wig .
penny , there &apos;s no &quot; i &quot; in &quot; justice league . &quot;
well , actually ...
don &apos;t . he &apos;s making our case .
okay , babe . uh ...
kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends .
okay . you know what ?
i changed my mind . i &apos;m not going .
looks like someone else is going to have to be wonder woman .
babe , open up .
i &apos;m not talking to you .
then who are you talking to ?
babe ?
penny , penny , penny , penny , penny , penny , penny ,
penny , penny , penny , penny , penny , penny , penny ,
penny , penny , penny , penny , penny , penny , penny ,
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i &apos;m the flash .
i just knocked 30,000 times .
okay . what do you want , sheldon ?
i understand why you &apos;re upset .
really ?
yes .
you &apos;re afraid that costume makes you look fat .
no .
wh @-@ what ...
does it ?
don &apos;t worry .
wonder woman was an amazon .
and amazons tend to be very beefy gals .
good @-@ bye , sheldon .
but they &apos;re not blonde , so put on your wig .
hello ?
stupid aquaman .
if it makes you feel any better ,
when i was dating penny ,
she used to flip out on me all the time .
whoa . you dated penny ?
she didn &apos;t tell you ?
she told me she dated a guy named leonard .
who would have thought it was you ?
who else would it be ?
i don &apos;t know . somebody bigger and ...
yeah , sure . why not you ?
i may have failed .
okay , i guess we just go without a wonder woman .
i don &apos;t want to go without penny .
oh , great . no superman , no wonder woman ?
all we &apos;ve got is a skinny flash ,
an indian aquaman ,
a nearsighted green lantern ,
and a teeny , tiny dark knight .
obviously , we &apos;re no longer a justice league .
we have no choice but to switch to our muppet baby costumes .
ooh , i call kermit .
斯库特是跑腿 剧场主人的侄子
i &apos;m kermit . u &apos;re scooter .
oh , man . scooter sucks .
he &apos;s the aquaman of the muppet babies .
no , we can still make this work .
leonard , you talk to penny .
what makes you think i can convince her ?
you got her to have sex with you .
obviously , your superpower is brainwashing .
okay , let me see if i understand this .
you want me to convince my ex @-@ girlfriend
to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend
just so we can win a stupid prize ?
yes . and make her wear the black wig . good luck .
go away , sheldon .
it &apos;s leonard .
go away , leonard .
come on , let me just talk to you .
it &apos;s open .
i &apos;m not going to that party , leonard .
okay , listen . you don &apos;t have to wear the wig .
at this party , we &apos;re gonna win first prize
just by showing up with a girl .
it &apos;s not the wig .
did i do something ?
i mean , i tried to be friends with zack ,
like you said , which believe me , was difficult ,
given how you and me used to be ...
you know , &quot; you and me , &quot; and now you and him are &quot; you and him . &quot;
okay , look . we &apos;re not really &quot; me and him . &quot;
then what are you ?
i don &apos;t know .
i only started seeing zack again
so i wouldn &apos;t be alone on new year &apos;s eve .
how pathetic is that ?
not as pathetic as dressing up like this
and going to a comic book store on new year &apos;s eve .
you make a cute green arrow .
green lantern .
like there &apos;s a difference .
there &apos;s a big difference .
arrow .
lantern .
whatever . look , if zack and i had just gone
to a regular club or a party , it would have been fine ,
but this , with the costumes , and you ...
what about me ?
nothing .
let &apos;s go to the party .
how do i look ?
i guarantee you &apos;ll be the prettiest girl there .
okay , the good news is , we have a wonder woman .
oh . yes .
what &apos;s the bad news ?
superman probably isn &apos;t getting laid tonight .
aw , damn .
and the award for best group costume goes to ...
justice league of america ...
number three !
thank you ! thank you so much !
okay . okay , ten seconds to midnight .
ten , nine , eight ...
no , wait !
i have a speech .
seven , six ...
stop counting !
five , four , three ...
this is my moment , dag nab it !
two , one !
happy new year !
i &apos;m not going to say another word
until you people settle down .
i &apos;m waiting .
that was a great party .
we should dress like this all the time .
are you high ?
you &apos;re being a bully .
check it out .
those guys are breaking into that car .
what should we do ?
we &apos;re the justice league of america .
there &apos;s only one thing we can do .
turn around and slowly walk away .
nah .
hold up .
look , i know our winter thermostat setting
is 72 degrees , but i &apos;m a little warm ,
so i &apos;m going to turn it down .
good lord , how you frustrate me , leonard hofstadter !
