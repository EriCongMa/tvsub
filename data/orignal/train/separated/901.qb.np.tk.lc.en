back in the &apos; 80s , the mustache was king .
nothing said &quot; i &apos;m a man &quot; like a bristly patch of lip hair .
but the manliest mustache of all
was magnum , p.i. himself , tom selleck ...
next to my dad &apos;s , that is .
look at magnum go !
such power and grace .
like a mustachioed gazelle in a hawaiian shirt .
he got the idea for the &apos; stache
from his new best friend , bill lewis ,
and it bonded them like we &apos;d never seen before .
you know , i used to think his was a lip wig ,
but he swims with it .
that &apos;s the real deal .
you &apos;re looking pretty bushy there , too , mur @-@ man .
thick and manly yourself , billy @-@ boy .
as much as my dad loved his new mustache , my mom hated it .
he looks like a criminal
or the tenor in a damn barbershop quartet .
don &apos;t go around saying
your husband &apos;s in a barbershop quartet .
that is the lowest form of musical entertainment .
just use an instrument , damn it .
you know , the only reason he grew that mug rug
is &apos; cause bill pushed him into it .
i &apos;m telling you , the guy &apos;s a bad influence .
so , it &apos;s not the ferkokte mustache you hate , it &apos;s bill .
stop . i like bill all right .
well , except for the way
he dresses , drives , walks , talks , eats , thinks , laughs ,
and tilts his stupid bald head to the side when he &apos;s confused .
yep , you could say my mother wasn &apos;t the biggest fan of my dad &apos;s bestie ,
who was hanging around more and more .
ooh , charlie &apos;s angels .
who are they chasing ? where &apos;s bosley ?
why is she on a boat ?
who &apos;s she kissing ?
are those pirates ?
these are the opening credits , bill .
and while my mom usually called the shots ,
lately , it seemed that bill was in charge .
a mustache comb !
and all this time , i &apos;ve been using a brush with a handle like a jackass .
give it a whirl , mur . take it down to whisker town .
are you kidding me with this ?
we should be talking about shaving , not grooming .
come on , lady ,
everyone knows a man &apos;s face is his castle .
his castle , you say ?
oh , yeah . and the mustache is the moat of the mouth .
without it , the fortress falls .
who knew ? i didn &apos;t .
in fact , the mustache is named after the earl of mustache .
what did he do ?
well , he was from mustache , france ,
and one day he was like ,
&quot; i &apos;m gonna grow some hair right here . &quot;
you can not argue with history , bevy .
honey , please , can you just shave it off for me ?
luckily , my mom could always win
using her creepy 12 @-@ blink puppy dog stare ...
this is the new me .
... until now .
oh , yeah . getting in all the nooks and crannies .
fantastic .
get it , mur .
i &apos;m getting it .
you go on and get it .
oh , i &apos;m getting it but good .
get it , doggy .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
is barking a mustache thing ?
oh , yeah . go on , doggy .
i &apos;m going !
it was october 21 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my brother was doing what he did best --
being way too cocky .
uh , you sure this is a good idea , man ?
seems like the ramp points directly at the side of the van , bro .
honestly , my concern is i jump too high and too far .
maybe we should put a mattress back there for safety .
jtp !
jtp .
oh , cool .
barry &apos;s doing that sweet trick
where he damages his head again .
well , hello , lainey .
this is all for you , girl .
time to put myself in serious danger .
hot , right ?
barry , i told you a million times ,
jumping stuff does not impress me .
for all of my brother &apos;s ridiculous over @-@ confidence ,
there was one person who could make him crumble
into an insecure mess -- his girlfriend , lainey lewis .
i &apos;m sorry ! i &apos;ll never jump stuff again .
see ? no more bike .
okay , so now i &apos;m the lame @-@ ass ball @-@ and @-@ chain
who says no to your passions ?
so , you do want me to jump stuff ?
i don &apos;t care , okay ? just do what you want .
i want you to not be mad at me .
i &apos;m not mad at you .
well , your face and your words are clearly mad .
oh , my god .
tell me in words i understand .
what do i do or feel or think ?
i think you need to get a grip .
better yet ,
get a girl that &apos;s not miles out of your league .
hey , erica ! look what i can do !
is she looking ?
erica , i did it !
my god . what is barry &apos;s deal ?
it &apos;s like he gets more needy and insecure every day .
i live with him . it &apos;s constant .
god , i wish there was some way to snap him out of it .
well , if the goal is to show barry what an idiot he &apos;s being ,
i do have years of wonderful experience .
so you &apos;d help teach him a lesson ?
unleash me .
i don &apos;t know , you look too excited right now .
excited to help my friend .
okay , i &apos;m desperate . let &apos;s do it .
promise you won &apos;t be too mean , though .
promise .
lainey &apos;s in love with another man ? !
you &apos;re dating a girl way out of your league .
it was bound to happen .
who is it ? ! tell me .
i &apos;ll destroy him with my hands and feet .
it &apos;s him .
boy george ?
from the glam @-@ pop band culture club ?
what does he have that i don &apos;t have ?
he &apos;s cute , he &apos;s cool , he &apos;s stylish --
everything you &apos;re not .
then it &apos;s settled .
i &apos;m flying to england and challenging him to a duel .
maybe i &apos;ll even slip him my demo tape .
no , i will not get distracted !
dude , you &apos;re missing the point .
if you can rock this look , you can rock lainey &apos;s heart .
yes .
i don &apos;t have to destroy boy george .
i can be boy george .
or should i say &quot; barry george &quot; ?
you should say &quot; boy barry . &quot;
really ? barry george sounds better .
it really doesn &apos;t .
boy barry it is . thanks , erica .
i have no idea how i &apos;ll ever pay you back .
money &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll smash my piggy bank .
that &apos;ll do .
mom , you need to vacuum in here .
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
and you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m hawaiian super @-@ sleuth magnum , p.i.
you &apos;re right ! that &apos;s exactly what i was thinking !
my god , bill , please don &apos;t tell me
you blew all your money on this thing .
oh , god , no . i can &apos;t afford this car .
just taking it out for a very leisurely test ride .
i &apos;m sorry , are you saying
you have no intention of purchasing ?
because you made it sound like you --
bup @-@ bup ! i &apos;m still considering it , randy .
oh , murray , what do you say
we magnum over to geno &apos;s for cheese steaks ?
oh , no , there &apos;s no food allowed in the car .
uh , and we have to stay within
a two @-@ mile radius of the showroom .
not now , randy . let &apos;s magnum !
no magnuming . uh , murray and i have plans tonight .
what plans ?
i &apos;m gonna iron while he watches tv in his chair .
it &apos;s our thing .
yeah , i can watch you iron tomorrow night .
this just feels right .
sweet ride , dude !
but you cannot pull off that outfit .
your son walks his own path . i get what lainey sees in him .
i don &apos;t .
hey , mur , take the wheel .
yeah !
randy , hit the bricks .
uh , okay , i will get fired .
yeah , just stay here for a while .
my mom was livid .
she couldn &apos;t take it out on my dad ,
so she took it out on his tighty @-@ whities .
mustaches , fast cars , tom selleck ,
and where does it end ?
with me , all alone , ironing underpants
like some goblin who lives beneath the streets .
i think you &apos;re overstating it , bev .
murray finally has a friend .
you can &apos;t change that , and you can &apos;t change bill .
you &apos;re right .
that &apos;s the answer .
i need to change bill .
i didn &apos;t say &quot; change bill . &quot; i said the exact opposite .
yeah , you don &apos;t need to repeat yourself , dad ,
i &apos;ll do it .
do not do it !
agreed . doing it .
do not do it .
doing it .
i &apos;ll change bill and make him the best best friend
my husband could have .
you &apos;re just hearing specific words
to suit your own horrible needs .
just .
no !
you &apos;re the best , dad .
as my mom was preparing to fix my dad &apos;s best friend ,
barry was ready to win lainey &apos;s heart at all costs .
&apos;sup , football team ?
looking good , band nerds .
i &apos;ll tumble for you , johnny atkins .
oh , my god ! what did you tell him ?
that you &apos;re in love with another boy ... george .
hey , sweet baby girl .
need a personal escort to class by barry george ?
damn it ! i meant boy barry .
point is , drink me in .
oh , god ! stop ! don &apos;t do that .
what &apos;s the matter ? you don &apos;t like it ?
on boy george . not on barry goldberg from jenkintown .
you can &apos;t pull this off , dude .
but i cracked my piggy bank and everything .
we were just trying to teach you a lesson .
you &apos;ve been so needy lately .
so , this was all a lie ? you were just messing with me ?
how could you do this ?
you &apos;re my girlfriend .
i mean , do you really want to hurt me ?
oh , my god . it &apos;s happening .
do you really want to make me cry ?
he &apos;s saying it for real .
i &apos;m sorry you think i &apos;m so insecure .
trust me , you don &apos;t need to worry anymore .
we &apos;re done .
thanks for inviting me over , bev .
this shrimp parm is delicious .
anything for murray &apos;s best friend .
are you saying that i &apos;m his best friend ...
or did he say that ?
tell me exactly what he said , word for word .
no , don &apos;t tell me .
tell me .
no , he said it .
yahtzee !
oh , my god . my heart is beating out of my chest .
yes , it is very exciting .
and now that you two are best bros ,
you &apos;re not only important to him ,
you &apos;re important to me ...
thanks , beverly .
that means a lot .
... which is why i &apos;ve decided ,
out of the goodness of my heart
and because i &apos;m a decent person
who cares deeply for my husband , to change you .
wait . wh @-@ what ?
bill , you don &apos;t have a woman in your life
telling you all the things you do
that are wrong and stupid .
i will be that woman .
actually , i really haven &apos;t missed that very much .
look , i &apos;m not trying to change who you are .
i just want to fix how you
dress , drive , walk , talk , eat , think , and laugh .
that seems like almost all of me .
i don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happening .
don &apos;t move , let &apos;s start right there .
see ? no need for the head tilt .
you &apos;re not a confused dog . you &apos;re a confused man .
why the heck are you coming down on me so hard ?
murray &apos;s mustache ? the hawaiian shirts ?
the defiant attitude ?
that &apos;s not the husband i created .
oh , i see what &apos;s happening here .
you want to change me because i threaten you .
you threaten me ?
oh @-@ ho , please .
you used to call the shots with murray ,
but now you &apos;re just passing through bill country .
we &apos;ll see who calls the shots
when i get him to shave off his mustache .
don &apos;t you dare !
he looks powerful and handsome , like a circus strong @-@ man .
well , i think he looks like he &apos;s got on his face .
murray is an eagle that needs to soar ,
but you just want to lasso him back to the nest .
oh , he soars !
he soars big @-@ time .
and i am the wind beneath his wings .
oh , no , i am the wind that blows across the ocean ,
and murray is but a leaf on my mighty gust .
you take that back !
never ! there &apos;s a new force of nature in murray &apos;s life .
it &apos;s me !
bill had started the mustache war ,
but my mom was gonna finish it .
it had been two days since lainey embarrassed barry ,
and he refused to let it go .
what do you want ?
got you some grind wax for your bmx .
thought i could go watch you jump stuff .
sorry , you don &apos;t get to live the highs and lows
that is bicycle motocross through me anymore .
i messed up .
you can &apos;t just break up with me . i love you .
well , if that &apos;s how you treat someone you love , count me out .
don &apos;t worry , he &apos;ll come crawling back when he realizes
that he &apos;ll never get a girl like you ever again .
see , that &apos;s the whole problem .
for some reason , barry is convinced
i am out of his league .
i may have mentioned it once or twice ...
a day .
oh , then you &apos;re gonna help me romance your brother
and win him back .
ew . never .
please ! there has to be something i can do .
like chuck norris .
barry loves that dude .
maybe he can apologize for me .
chuck seems like an accessible guy , right ?
barry &apos;s written to chuck a few times .
i think that &apos;s a dead end .
maybe i can jump something to impress barry
or body slam adam or challenge an animal to a fight .
what &apos;s the name of that horse that barry has a problem with ?
if you really want to fix this ,
just do a big , embarrassing display that says
&quot; i love you , and i don &apos;t care
if i look like an idiot saying it . &quot;
if embarrassing myself gets me one more kiss
from his drooly , cheeto @-@ dusted lips , i &apos;m in .
i &apos;m sorry , i ca-- i can &apos;t be with you right now .
i just can &apos;t .
as lainey plotted a way to show barry her love ,
my mom &apos;s plot to win the war of murray was in full swing .
beverly !
good morning , handsome .
i made your favorite -- food .
and here &apos;s your newspaper and tushie pillow .
you mowed my magnum off while i slept .
who does that ?
funny story . me .
she lathered your face , shaved you clean ,
and you didn &apos;t even wake up ?
when i go down , i go down hard .
oh , i get a lot done while he &apos;s asleep .
fingernails , nose hairs , rough elbows , q @-@ tip work .
soup to nuts .
it &apos;s so smooth , like a puppy &apos;s paw .
let me get in there , see what all the fuss is about .
i want you to drop by bill &apos;s store on your lunch break
and show him my handiwork .
will everybody stop touching me ? !
use my name . it &apos;s beverly . say it .
i know your name !
is this why you &apos;re doing all of this ?
because you hate my best friend ?
i don &apos;t hate him , hon .
all i did was show that ridiculous ass @-@ for @-@ brains
whose face this is --
mine .
and you will speak of what happened here .
enough ! you , me , and bill are going to talk this out .
you ... want to talk ?
of course not .
but you &apos;ve forced me into it .
i think he &apos;s secretly happy .
while my mom wanted to show bill she had won ,
lainey was trying to win back barry .
hey , big tasty . it &apos;s me , mcdlt .
i keep the hot side hot and the cool side cool .
i &apos;m not interested .
maybe this will change your mind .
jtp , kick me a beat .
let the whole school laugh at me -- i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;d do anything for a guy named barry
all the girls want him , but i don &apos;t want to share @-@ y
what followed was the worst , most ill @-@ conceived rap
ever performed in school history .
unfortunately , lainey was hot and popular ,
so this happened .
hey , lainey lewis is rapping . she &apos;s awesome .
love is a love i &apos;m thinking of
love is a love that loves my love
love from above fits like a glove
like any great performance ,
there was something for everyone .
no , she &apos;s making fun of
barry goldberg &apos;s dreams and aspirations .
hilarious . give it to him , lainey !
well , everyone except barry ,
who was elbowed out of his own apology rap ,
which quickly caught on with the crowd .
barry , where are you going ?
she &apos;s showing how much she loves you
by embarrassing herself the way that you would .
she can &apos;t even embarrass herself when she tries .
all this proves is what you &apos;ve always said .
she &apos;s out of my league .
while barry gave up on lainey , my dad was fighting for bill .
okay , you two have forced my hand ,
so now we &apos;re gonna have to talk ...
about feelings .
i &apos;ll go first .
i &apos;m feeling mad .
you &apos;re mad ?
how could you let her take your &apos; stache , mur ? how ?
that &apos;s not the only thing i took , big guy .
that &apos;s not yours ! that &apos;s a friendship comb !
it &apos;s a spoil of war .
stop it , both of you . there is no war .
open your eyes , fool . look at her just peacocking me .
she thinks she &apos;s won , but we &apos;re just getting started .
are we , now ?
we are .
court @-@ side seats to the sixers , mur .
you want to stay here and watch &quot; charlie &apos;s angels &quot;
or go watch charlie barkley ?
nobody calls him that .
someone does -- maybe his mama
or a close cousin who &apos;s more like a sibling .
all right , enough .
bevy , you &apos;re gonna have to be the bigger person here
and apologize so we can move past this .
me apologize ? for what ?
that &apos;s right , bevy .
looks like your man &apos;s on my side .
there are no sides .
i think it &apos;s time we settle this once and for all .
it &apos;s a simple choice , really .
her or me ?
what ?
that &apos;s right , woman . you forgot .
i negotiate big tile contracts for a living ,
and i always win .
overplayed my hand , huh ?
yeah , you did .
hey , listen . i got a counteroffer .
how about tuesday nights and every other weekend ?
yeah , the thing is , she &apos;s my wife .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s over .
nah , i get it .
makes sense now with a little distance .
yeah , we probably should have
discussed the details of your plan beforehand .
seems that way .
it &apos;s for the best .
for you .
you &apos;re in charge around here , and i &apos;m good with that .
but i kind of liked having a friend ,
and it would have been nice if you liked him , too .
even though my mom won
the infamous goldberg mustache war ,
my dad was the real casualty .
who &apos;s there ? bill ?
better .
i &apos;m charlie &apos;s most sensible angel , kate jackson .
i &apos;m the one who wears pants .
what is this ? what &apos;s happening ?
glad you asked , bosley .
i was thinking we could take a little joy ride
in this sporty automobile we have no intention of buying .
but you said we were close . i ran a credit check .
don &apos;t blow the sale , randy .
honey , i know bill was your friend ,
but i &apos;m your best friend .
and any fun you had with him , you can have with me .
i &apos;m sorry , bevy . it &apos;s just not the same .
i &apos;m gonna go in and watch tv .
you can come in and iron if you want .
but i bought a wig .
i will no longer be a pawn in your family drama !
while randy had had enough ,
lainey was finally realizing that it was over with barry .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really over .
you really love that big dummy , don &apos;t you ?
i really do .
and in that moment , my sister decided to do
the last thing she ever wanted to .
win back my brother &apos;s heart .
put down the cheetos . lainey needs you .
trust me , she doesn &apos;t .
she does .
look , a lot of this is my fault .
i &apos;ve told you every day that you &apos;re not good enough for her .
but you know what ?
i was wrong .
she &apos;s lucky to have you .
but she embarrassed me in front of the whole school .
and you embarrass her every day by being you .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m the worst , and she still loves me .
she loves me !
that was an amazing thing you just did , honey .
i guess sometimes two people just need each other
no matter how weird it seems to everyone else .
that night , erica didn &apos;t just open up barry &apos;s eyes .
she made my mom realize how blind she &apos;d been .
mom , what are you doing ?
not now , poopie .
i &apos;ll catch up with you .
wear a raincoat next time .
bill , we need to talk .
who is it ?
no one .
i deserve that .
bill , i am so sorry for everything .
i felt threatened , okay ?
i started to think maybe you could give murray
things that i couldn &apos;t ,
but i realize that might actually be a good thing .
you know what &apos;s a good thing ?
this right here .
and , lainey , barry loves you so much .
i think he was so afraid of losing you ,
he ended up pushing you away .
lainey ! lainey !
we have to talk .
it &apos;s okay . we &apos;re okay .
we are ?
yeah .
but i didn &apos;t even get to say what i --
mama took care of it .
are you kidding me ? !
i had a beautiful speech planned out .
cramping . my leg &apos;s cramping .
oh , oh , sit .
you know , now that we &apos;re square ,
maybe i &apos;ll go upstairs and shave the old &apos; stache .
there &apos;s only one thing you need to do right now --
go to him .
i &apos;m coming , mur !
why are we running , too ?
i left a lasagna in the oven .
lasagna !
in life , there are certain relationships
that define who you are -- your first teen crush ,
your best friend , your family ...
for $ 5,000 , it &apos;s the title of a play ...
&quot; death of a salesmat . &quot;
really ?
what &apos;s a salesmat ?
how would i know ? i &apos;m not a salesmat salesman .
aww , so close , baby .
you two are the worst .
these are the relationships that matter the most .
but they &apos;re also the hardest ,
&apos;cause when you truly love someone ,
you sometimes hold on too tight ,
afraid that you &apos;ll lose them .
here you go , boys . bagel bites .
actually , i think i &apos;m gonna take off .
got somewhere to be .
later , bill .
yep .
but the truth is ,
when you give the people you love most just a little space ,
you &apos;ll find the place they really want to be
is right at your side .
oh , adam , please .
you know , you have to start getting dressed , okay ?
please turn that off .
out of the way , nerd .
hey , i @-@ i @-@ i was just looking through the mail .
actually , there &apos;s something here for you .
&quot; master barry goldberg ? &quot;
from c. norris ? hollywood , california ?
dude , chuck norris wrote me back !
&quot; dear barry , sorry it took me so long to write back ,
but thanks for the nice words and for being a fan .
i have given a great deal of thought
to what i &apos;m about to tell you . &quot;
what &apos;s he saying ?
shut up !
&quot; herein lies my most precious secret
to being a true martial arts warrior .
if you have a brother , obey him .
he has a power you do not yet understand .
godspeed , douche @-@ nozzle .
sincerely , chuck norris . &quot;
so , what &apos;s it say , douche @-@ nozzle ?
it says i should kick your ass .
