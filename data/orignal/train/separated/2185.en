No! No! No! No!
Daddy, I want to go home!
No! No!
Here's Daddy. Here's Daddy.
It's just a bad dream, sweetheart.
It's just a bad dream.
I got you.
I got you.
I got you. I got you, sweetie.
It's gonna be all right. It's all right.
Been a few weeks now since the last one.
Beginning to think maybe she's ready to get past it,
but last night, man, it just...
It was awful.
Another nightmare, huh?
Yeah.
The whole thing-- the abduction...
and being locked up in a cage...
and watching Ian die and...
It just plays over and over on a loop in her head.
And she can't... It just never ends.
That son of a bitch Ian, man.
He really got under my daughter's skin.
She can't shake it.
Yeah.
We both know what it's like not to want to close your eyes.
Only cure for that though is time.
This is killing me.
I feel utterly helpless.
Every night, I pray to God to take this thing off of her
and put it on me 'cause I can handle it.
This is my little girl.
She shouldn't have to carry this.
You know what though, Lou? Let me tell you something.
You're doing the only thing you can do.
You're being there for Samantha.
Knowing she's got a father that loves her
and will do whatever it takes to keep her safe...
that's exactly what she needs right now.
Fool!
You've fallen right into my trap!
Without you to protect them,
the people of Earth will perish!
You better get in there and help save Gotham.
Carpool's gonna be here in ten minutes.
All right, you two warriors! Let me see this!
Let's go, Supermen.
To school!
Capes down, brush your teeth,
grab your backpacks.
I really appreciate you rearranging your day like this.
I know it's a pain.
Comes with the territory when
you are married to a real superhero.
I'll make it up to you tonight.
I promise.
You always do.
I...
Not negotiable.
You have a long day of surgery ahead.
Love you.
I love you, too.
I wish you could babysit me every day, Poppy.
I wish I could, too, kiddo.
Are you gonna be here after school?
Oh, you better believe it.
Um, your parents get home around dinner time, eh?
What do you say we take them to J.J. Dolan's for some pizza?
Cool.
We're gonna have fun, Poppy.
We sure will.
Be a good boy.
You, too.
Is the patient prepped?
Yes.
Okay, go ahead and place an A line and a central line
before he goes into the O.R.
Copy that.
Yes, and then we can put the ventricular drain
to stabilize the intracranial bleeding.
How far out are you?
I'll be up in a minute.
I'm pulling into the garage now.
Dig deep. You got this.
Keep breathing. Okay?
Just a little further.
All right, push yourself now. Push yourself.
Straight away, push yourself.
Go, Grace! Go!
Go! Push yourself, Grace!
That's it.
That right there is what we call
a six-minute, 18-second mile.
That President's Physical Fitness medal is in the bag.
You hear me?
Good, 'cause I didn't do so hot last year.
Forget about last year.
This year's gonna be different.
Thanks for helping me, Uncle Steve.
Danno says the only thing he hates
more than swimming is running.
Don't worry about Danno.
You know, it scares me to think
what that guy's gonna be like
when he actually is a grumpy old man.
I know.
That looks just like your car, Uncle Steve.
Because it is my car.
Listen to me, you don't... you don't move from this spot.
Okay? You don't talk to anybody...
Okay, I won't.
Don't move, all right?
I won't, I won't. I promise. Go!
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch.
McGarrett.
All right, I'm on the way.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't hang up.
I need to report a stolen car.
It's mine.
Let me ask you a question.
Okay? At what point
did you think that it was a good idea to leave
my innocent 12-year-old daughter alone
in a... in a deserted street by herself?
When did you think that was okay?
Good morning. I'm fine.
How are you though?
No.
No, no, no, no. Don't do that, okay?
Answer the question.
What?
It's not like I left her in the middle of Makaha.
Oh, right, right.
Because deviants and nutjobs
and psychopaths, they only hunt victims
in-in high-crime neighborhoods. Is that right?
She was never in any danger, Danny.
I left for, like, not even five minutes.
Okay? I mean...
you're overreacting like usual.
Excu... I'm overreacting?
Yeah, you're over...
I'm sorry I don't obsess
over every possible worst-case scenario in life.
No, no. You obsess over a death trap on wheels.
You know what? That car is a classic.
Mind yourself.
Oh, please.
With the sales pitch. It's a classic piece of junk, that car.
You know what that car means to me.
Do you not?
All right, don't do that, okay?
You do something wrong,
and then somehow you turn it around and I'm the bad guy.
You are the bad guy.
You can't see how you're the bad guy in this?
No, I don't.
You guys still seeing that therapist?
All right, you need a few more sessions.
Our victim's name is Dr. Christine DuPont.
She's a chief neurosurgeon on staff here.
She was called in this morning on her day off
to perform an emergency surgery.
Not only did the shooter
know the doctor's schedule,
he also knew the entire hospital security system layout.
He managed to get in and out of here
without once getting his mug picked up on camera.
Commander, you might want to take a look at this.
Fell out of the doctor's clothing.
It looks like a through-and-through.
Copper-jacketed.
Probably nine-millimeter semi-auto.
No shell casings found at the scene.
Shooter must have policed his own brass.
This was a well-planned hit.
Who puts a hit out on a brain surgeon?
This might explain it.
Dr. DuPont was brought in to operate on Paul Delano.
Who in the hell is that?
He's a, um, organized crime guy
that we have a bad history with.
He was brought in this morning from Halawa Prison,
and according to the warden, he went to the infirmary
last night complaining of a severe headache.
The CAT scan showed a slow-leaking brain aneurysm,
but because of the delicate location of the hemorrhage,
Dr. DuPont was the best chance they had
of saving Delano's life.
Looks like somebody didn't want that to happen.
Gang Intel in Halawa has an informant in general pop
who says that Delano has been bragging about
running his O.C. Operations from inside the prison.
Well, the easiest place to get him would have been from inside,
so that kind of rules out other inmates.
Mm-hmm. And the prison ward here is well protected.
Taking out a surgeon from the parking garage
was a much easier play.
You know, could be a rival crew on the outside
looking to take out some competition.
Yeah, or it could've been one of Delano's crew
trying to move up the chain of command.
Anyway, this guy's got no shortage of enemies.
So that info on our vic coming in
to perform a surgery on her day off,
that had to come from someone on the hospital staff
or someone inside Delano's inner circle.
Yep, I agree with you.
That's the only way that hit could have been
pulled off as quickly as it was.
Mm-hmm. I had HPD put a protection detail
on the surgeon who came in to replace Dr. DuPont.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly,
as I live and breathe.
Yeah, well, hopefully, that won't be for too much longer.
How's what's left of the family?
Keep talking, all right?
I'm gonna do these nice people a favor and open up
that big head of yours before you get in the O.R.
What's going on here?
This man's about to go into surgery.
Doc, I'd like you to meet two of my dearest of friends.
This is Steve McGarrett and Chin Ho Kelly.
They're two of Five-O's finest.
My brother murdered Kelly's wife two years ago,
he's still sore about it.
Go figure.
Hey, Doc, we're gonna need another minute with this guy.
He doesn't have another minute.
This man needs an operation now or he could die.
In that case, we need five more.
If you delay him, and he dies,
that's murder.
I think it's best if you wait outside.
Right now, let's go.
I like your style, boys.
As charming as ever.
What'd I just tell you before?
I told you to shut up, all right?
Your surgeon
was assassinated in the parking lot this morning.
We think it was to take you out by proxy.
Now you pay attention!
Are you serious?
Do you actually think we want to be here talking to you?
Wh-who do you think is behind it?
Well, that was my next question for you.
I mean, you're the one who's been
shooting your mouth off in Halawa,
talking about running your shop from the inside.
Why don't we start with the people
who have more to gain from seeing you dead than alive.
Present company excluded.
All right. All right.
The only thing I've been running the joint is my mouth.
I'm broke,
and there's no organization left.
But as long as those animals
think that I got some kind of juice on the outside,
that's what keeps me alive in that hellhole.
Now, this lady doc,
I understand she was my best shot at getting out of here alive.
If I knew who was trying to whack me, i would tell you,
but not because I like you.
Because if I have to go back to Halawa,
I'm not gonna be that hard to find.
Your minute's up.
This is absolutely outrageous.
You know, Kelly,
if I do happen to make it out,
I would be very, very interested
in seeing you again on the outside sometime.
You know where to find me.
Oh, you bet your ass I do.
Uh, but, uh...
should I not make it,
I'll be sure to say hello to your wife for you.
Who would want to kill Christine?
Well, at first we believed it was to prevent her
from operating on a convict who had a lot of enemies.
But we've since found out that's not the case.
It just doesn't make any sense.
Did you notice any unusual behavior
from your wife recently?
Uh, she stayed late at the office
a couple of nights last week.
She said she had to check on some...
something personal for a patient.
Did she happen to say what that is?
Mr. DuPont, are you sure that
your wife didn't mention anything about this?
Even the smallest thing can be important.
No.
I-I'm sorry.
W-With two kids and both of us working full-time,
we barely saw each other during the week,
and when we did, we-we really
tried not to talk shop.
She was gonna fill me in this weekend.
W-we had plans to take the boys to the beach.
What do I tell them?
Recognize this theme?
I didn't think so.
It's "Merry Widow"
from Alfred Hitchcock's
Shadow of a Doubt,
written by Dimitri Tiomkin, 1943.
Considered one of the greatest psychological thrillers of all time.
Ah, very nice, very nice.
Is that why we were here, Max, for movie trivia?
Just setting the mood.
Oh, that's nice.
This man was brought in from the ICU
of the Kuakini Medical Center last night
for a routine clinical autopsy.
He was recently diagnosed with terminal brain cancer
while incarcerated in the Oahu Correctional.
They deemed the tumor to be inoperable,
so they sent him to the ICU last week
for end-of-life care.
Okay, that's a good story, Max.
What does it have to do with her murder?
Ah, in usual form, Detective,
you've managed to trample on the punch line.
As I was about to say, before I was so rudely interrupted,
was that Dr. Dupont was also Mr. Tahni's surgeon.
Okay, well, I'm sure, Max,
that she operated on many patients.
Tahni had a brain tumor.
She's a neurosurgeon.
That's what neurosurgeons do.
Yes, that is correct.
But what we have here is more than just coincidence.
In fact, Hitchcock himself would have been amused
at the strange confluence of circumstances.
Really? Why is that?
Because cancer didn't kill Mr. Tahni.
It was murder.
Behold.
As you can see by the ruptured blood vessel in the sclera,
Mr. Tahni died of asphyxiation.
The cotton fibers that I recovered
from the trachea and lungs tells me
that he was most likely smothered to death by a pillow.
All right, so the night before
Dr. Dupont gets taken out in the parking lot,
someone sneaks into the ICU
and takes out one of her patients.
That can't be a coincidence.
These murders are connected, right?
Okay, but why kill a man who has less than a week to live?
Son of a bitch.
It's not that bad, McGarrett.
It's not that bad?
There's no wheels on my car.
There's no physical damage other than parts missing,
and those are all replaceable.
They're not replaceable.
Everything on this car except for the windshield
is original from the factory,
just like the day my dad brought it home.
There's a homeless encampment on the beach not far from here.
Maybe somebody saw something.
Listen, I want any spare units canvassing the area
for anybody who may have seen somebody driving her, all right?
I don't care what you got to do.
We got to find this guy.
You may also want to look at this.
Whoever's been stripping the car
left their tools behind.
I'm thinking they'll probably be back for more.
You know what? Leave it just where it is.
Duke, I want around-the-clock surveillance on it.
Contact auto crime.
Have them canvass the area
for all the body shops around here,
see if we can find the jackass selling my parts.
Will do.
You want me to get CSU down here to process first?
No, it's just gonna attract unnecessary attention.
What is all that?
This is a vintage automobile survival kit.
What is he doing?
Not needing CSU.
Bingo.
Pua, run these prints through AFIS.
See if we get a hit.
Right away.
Well, Tahni wasn't gonna win any citizenship awards,
that's for sure.
This guy spent 40 of his 55 years on this planet
in some type of correctional facility.
At age 14,
he spent two years at the Wailea reform school for boys
after committing multiple burglaries.
At age 16, one month out of Wailea,
he committed a home invasion robbery and murdered
the homeowner in the process.
That earned him a life sentence at Oahu correctional.
Prison records say that he hasn't had contact
with the outside world in several years now.
How'd he do inside?
Model prisoner, kept to himself.
Doesn't sound like the kind of guy who's had too many enemies.
Yeah, well, neither did Dr. Dupont,
But we-we know they both had at least one, right?
Hey, so I did a data pull
on Dr. Dupont's hospital desktop computer
to see what she was working on after hours.
So, she's doing internet searches
on five different people.
All she had to go on were their names.
She could only find information on one person.
Walter Russell.
So, he was never convicted of a crime,
but he was charged
with felony official misconduct back in '75 when he was a warden
of the Wailea reform school.
Wait a minute, '75?
Russell was a warden while Tahni was there.
Well, state investigators were called in
after complaints of kids being abused
and living under horrible conditions.
So, it wasn't enough to Russell to trial,
but he was forced to resign.
And a year later, the school was shut down for good.
So, Tahni's on his deathbed.
He's got no one,
and Dr. Dupont is the first person
to even treat the guy like a human being in years,
so he has his come-to-jesus moment
before he finally checks out for good.
He decides to spill the beans about something that happened
in reform school back in the day.
And the doctor reaches out to Russell,
not realizing he's involved,
and Russell clips them both.
That's a theory.
It's more than that, actually,
'cause Dr. Dupont placed a call from her cell phone
to Russell's house two days ago,
and they talked for a few minutes.
Yeah, the cell phone that was never found at the crime scene.
Her husband said she kept it with her all the time.
Well, that means whoever killed her
took that cell phone trying to cover their tracks.
Fong pinged the phone.
It's been turned off.
Well, I have the carrier pulling
files and records from the cloud.
All right, give me a last known address on Russell.
Let's dig a little deeper into these other four names
that Dr. Dupont was researching.
Maybe Russell wasn't acting alone.
How bad is your car?
It's bad.
Scale of one to ten?
Don't do this.
What am I doing?
Don't trivialize my suffering.
What? I'm gauging the damage of that piece of junk car of yours.
You just did it again. You just did it again.
All right.
Talk about something else.
Let's talk about something that you are more familiar with.
Like, uh, child endangerment, let's talk about that.
Okay.
I wouldn't have left your daughter
if you'd have been doing your job as a father.
How about that?
Wow, okay. I don't like to run.
All right?
Who doesn't like to run?
I said I don't like to run.
It's a rhetorical question.
What is that? I hate it when you do that. What is that?
You would have hated this more.
Ah, I see.
You're welcome.
Lou,
I got a booby trap.
This guy doesn't like company.
Copy that.
You're not kidding.
Drop the gun.
My man, just relax.
Shut up.
You are trespassing, sir.
Yes, technically, you're right.
But I'm a cop.
So that cancels your no visitors policy.
What are you doing here, cop?
I just want to ask you a few questions, Mr. Russell.
Just some questions.
Oh, it's the lady doctor.
That's what this is about, right?
She should have just left it alone.
It was none of her business. It was none of her business!
Did I tell you they ruined my life, huh?
They ruined it.
But that wasn't enough for her, no.
Wasn't enough!
Not for her.
She couldn't just let it sit.
She had to hurt me, huh?
She loved to hurt.
You didn't come alone, did you?
How many?
Enough to make sure that when this thing ends,
You get dragged out of here in a body bag.
Make them go away.
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, let's just step back.
Mr. Russell just wants to talk.
So everybody chill.
Let's hear what he's got to say.
You make them go away.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?
You're welcome. Again.
One, two, three. Lift.
You know, for some very strange reason--
I don't know why-- this whole thing
reminds me of an easter egg hunt that we had at Steve's.
I could not find, uh, this egg that I hid for Grace.
Well, in this case, the consequences
seem slightly more dire.
Hey.
Yeah.
"Chlorprozamine."
So Russell was either bipolar,
schizophrenic or both.
Either way, the guy was off his meds.
This bottle hasn't been touched.
Prescription was filled a few months ago.
Well, he seemed pretty sane rambling about Dr. Dupont
when he had that shotgun leveled at your head.
Well, he was ready for us.
Whatever Dupont was digging around for, he knew what it was.
All right, look, these were two well-planned murders.
A guy in his mental state, living the way he did,
There's no way he had the capacity to pull them off.
So HPD just spoke to one of the neighbors up the block.
She went driving by earlier this morning
and saw Russell working in the yard
About the same time that the doc was murdered.
All right, look,
we need to dig deeper into Russell's life.
But if he didn't pull the trigger on Dr. Dupont,
I bet he knew who did.
Kono, what do you got?
Dr. Dupont used a voice memo app on her phone
to record patient notes.
I recovered those audio files from the cloud.
Most of it is just doctor-patient related stuff,
but about a week ago,
she recorded this conversation between her and Tahni.
I was born nothing,
and I'm gonna die nothing.
That's not true, Mr. Tahni.
You might have made some bad choices in life,
but everybody's life has meaning.
No.
No, I'm a bad person, doc.
I've done some horrible things.
Most of my life,
I didn't give a damn about nobody.
But I liked those four boys I told you about.
They looked out for me.
They wasn't rotten like most of us in there.
They steal is all.
Mostly 'cause they didn't have nothing
and no family to keep them right.
I'm sorry, Mr. Tahni, but I don't understand
why you're telling me all this.
Or why you want me to record our conversation.
For proof.
Proof of what?
I never had nobody I could trust.
You can trust me.
Did something happen to those boys?
I'm pretty sure they were murdered.
The four boys that he's talking about
are the same four names that Dr. Dupont was researching.
Exactly.
They were all juvenile offenders locked up with Tahni
in the Wailea reform school back in the '70s.
According to the tapes, the four boys escaped from the school
back in June of 1974.
They stole a car
that was belonging to one of the guards,
and then they burglarized a bunch of homes
on the other side of the island.
The car was recovered,
but the boys were supposedly never found.
What do you mean, "supposedly"?
Well, the night after they escaped,
Tahni woke up to some noise outside his window.
Shut up and keep moving.
He saw the boys being led across the yard, shackled,
into a basement dungeon that the guards used
as solitary confinement.
They were being led there by a guard
that Tahni only knew his name is "Huhu."
"Angry."
A story about a prison guard named "angry"
does not end well.
It doesn't.
At first, Tahni didn't think much
of the boys being led to solitary.
It was just normal punishment.
But then a few nights later, he overheard an argument
between Huhu and another man
that he thought could have been Russell.
Well, what if someone saw you bringing them back?
Trust me, no one did.
What do we say if the family comes around
asking about them?
They won't. And even they did,
they escaped.
Simple as that.
You can't just make four boys disappear.
I already did.
Tahni never saw those boys again.
This guy,
Alex Mackey, was the one that everyone called Huhu.
He was the guard on duty the night the boys escaped.
It was his car that they stole.
And he was the last one to see those boys alive.
Sounds like he was the first one to see them dead, too.
Yeah. It actually gets better.
So, after the school shut down,
Mackey went to work at Kuakini Medical Center
as a maintenance man for the next 36 years until he retired
in 2011.
Okay, that explains
how he, uh, knew his way around the hospital
and had access to Dr. DuPont's schedule.
There's no public record
of any of those boys
beyond the night they escaped from the school.
It's like they just dropped off
the face of the earth after that night.
All right, so Tahni heard Russell say,
"You can't just make four kids disappear."
There's a chance their bodies never left those grounds.
Busy day.
Murder in the morning, school pickups
in the afternoon.
Poppy!
Hey, kiddo, how was school?
Alex Mackey.
Alex Mackey, come with me.
What are you doing?
Take it easy.
Come on.
Not in front of the kids. That's my grandson.
That's your grandson? Hey, look at me.
There's two kids up at Diamond Head right now,
and their mother's not
coming home for dinner, you son of a bitch.
Now come on. Come on, Huhu.
So, you are a very special, special tough guy, right?
I mean, you go after, uh, an innocent mother,
a respected doctor,
bunch of defenseless kids,
guy with cancer on his deathbed.
You ever go after anybody who actually
could defend themselves?
You would be my first.
Okay.
Why don't you do yourself a favor, Alex,
make it easy on yourself.
We know what you did. We know why you did it.
We just want to know where, that's all.
It's over, you understand? Where are the bodies?
It's not over.
You got nothing on me.
That's why I'm here, isn't it?
You got no witnesses,
no proof that I killed the doctor,
that-that punk murderer,
those kids-- nothing.
Go ahead, search my house,
search my car, search whatever you like.
You won't find nothing.
Look, I don't think you understand something, okay?
That woman that you murdered,
she's no different than your daughter, okay?
She's got a husband,
she has kids the same age as your grandson.
That's a very sad story, Detective.
Sounds like she owed it to those kids
to mind her own damn business.
Maybe she'd be alive if she still did.
Yeah, Kono, what do you got?
Is that right?
No, that's great. Listen.
Call me back when you confirm, okay?
You should hang on to that attitude as long as you can, pal,
'cause I'm pretty sure the next call I get is, uh...
is gonna wipe that stupid smirk
off your face for a very long time.
Let me see you for a sec.
Your thief came back to the car this morning.
There was a chase.
We caught him hiding at the homeless encampment
near the beach.
The prints from the Marquis were a match.
What's your name?
Nahele.
I have to call your parents, all right?
My mom is dead and my dad is in prison.
When's the last time you had something to eat?
I don't know.
Get him some food, some new clothes.
Yes, Commander.
I'm sorry.
I-I've never stolen anything before.
It's just that
I was so hungry.
It's all right. Just take it easy.
It's all right.
How long you been on the street?
A few months.
They tried to put me in one of those homes after my mom died,
but I couldn't stay there.
So I ran away.
Hey, boss.
You need to see this.
All right.
Get him fed and get him cleaned up,
and then, uh, just keep him here until I get back.
Copy that.
Commander, after a thorough examination,
I've determined that each of our young victims
were suffering from acute dehydration and starvation
in the days leading up to and at the time of their deaths.
Take a look at this.
The week they disappeared was
one of the hottest on record for Oahu.
Daytime temps hovered in the mid-90s for five straight days.
And...
this is the basement that the school used as solitary confinement.
The same one that Tahni saw the boys being led into
the night they returned.
No windows, no ventilation.
Must have been unbearable down there.
In that kind of heat,
left in a poorly ventilated space, without food or water
for a significant amount of time would be
equivalent to leaving an infant in a car
with a rolled-up window in the middle of the summer.
As a result of all these findings,
I'm listing the official cause of death
as homicide.
Place sucks, huh?
Enjoy it 'cause it's, uh, the Ritz-Carlton
compared to where you're going.
See, we found those boys up at that school.
We also found enough evidence
to throw your sorry ass in Halawa
for the rest of your life.
You didn't even have the decency to take the shackles
off those kids before you buried them.
Huhu?
We're not bluffing.
Nobody gave a rat's ass about those kids.
Nobody!
But that nosy doctor couldn't leave it alone.
It was over.
Forgotten about! Done!
No, you're wrong, actually.
You see, Tahni remembered, and for the first time
in his miserable life, he decided to do something good.
Piece of garbage.
Useless, worthless punk.
You know the world is a better place without those kids.
You know it is!
I don't know... I don't know about that, but what I do know
is that you are going to die in prison,
a "Useless, worthless punk"
that I'm pretty sure nobody cares about.
I'm done.
Thanks, Pua.
You know what that is?
That's a criminal complaint for felony grand larceny auto,
charging you with the theft of my car.
I-I understand, sir. And...
when I get out of jail,
promise I'll pay you back...
Hold on, hold on. I'm not done.
The only thing missing from this is my signature.
I'm gonna make you the deal of a lifetime.
All right?
This is what's gonna happen.
First, we're gonna go to all the body shops,
get back all the parts you sold off.
And then you and me,
we're gonna put my car back together exactly the way it was
before you took it.
As long as you keep your nose clean,
this complaint stays in my drawer, unsigned.
You understand?
Yes. Thank you.
Don't thank me yet.
I got eyes and ears all over this island.
If I hear one incident, you step out of line
one time for the smallest thing, I don't care what it is,
I'm gonna find you.
And I'm not gonna be the nice guy sitting across the desk
from you today. Do you understand?
Yes. Thank you.
This is your second chance, Nahele, all right?
Could be... could be your last chance.
Don't blow it, buddy. Take advantage of it.
I will, sir. I promise. I won't let you down.
You'll see.
All right.
Yeah, girl power.
That's what I'm talking about.
You should be really proud, Grace. That's a very big deal.
Believe it or not,
I was a former recipient.
Really? Wow. You should call Ripley's if that's true.
Hey, guys, I got some bad news.
Delano has been officially released from the ICU
and is expected to make a full recovery.
Well, we can still hope for stomach cancer.
Ooh, that's cold, cuz.
I'd settle for a shiv in the lunch line.
What's a shiv?
Hey. Look who's sporting the hardware.
You are looking at the number one girl
in her age group on the entire island.
What did I tell you, huh?
No thanks to Marathon Man here though, right?
Listen, I helped with everything except the running part, okay?
He did, Uncle Steve, really.
Okay. Guess we cut him some slack then, huh?
Hey, Steve, how's the kid doing?
He's doing all right.
All right, who's hungry? Let me have some of that.
Pass me some. Over here.
Hang on a second, Samantha.
What is it, Dad?
Sweetheart, you know I love you, right?
Of course I do.
All right.
And you know that if I could have,
I would've done anything in the world
to keep that stuff from happening to you.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do to change that now.
The only thing that can change now
is you.
And that's gonna take time.
Just like your body had to heal,
your mind has to heal, too,
and... you might have another bad night or two.
I'm not gonna promise you you're gonna forget
all about this one day,
but I can promise you it's gonna get easier.
You know, I can promise you that we will get through this...
as a family.
Your mother, your brother,
me and you.
And I want you to know
that whether I'm in the next room or not,
I'm always there for you, little mama.
Always.
All right.
You hungry?
I'm starving.
All right, come on, let's go eat.
You guys save any for us?
Hi! Look who came in first.
Wow, you really did it. That's awesome. Congrats.
Nice work, Gracie.
Thanks for giving the kid a job.
Sure thing, brah.
Although I got to rethink the free employee lunch policy.
Why is that?
It doesn't look like it, but the boy can eat.
Keiki's cutting into my profit like mad.
But other than that, he's a good kid.
Thank you, bruddah.
No sweat.
Mahalo.
Any time, bruddah.
You know what you are?
This should be good.
Uh... you're a-a half-baked cookie.
Soft, gooey on the inside.
Kid should be in juvenile hall
and you go and you give him a job.
That's why I love you, man.
You, uh... you like fixing broken toys, right?
Yeah. I guess I do.
