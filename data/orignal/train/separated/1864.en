There's no milk.
Damn, I forgot.
All I ask is for you to get the groceries.
And I forgot. I'm sorry.
You know, I-I-it's not like I'm sitting around.
I'm--I'm looking for a job.
Well, now we're gonna have to stop for coffee
before you drop me off at work.
Even good marriages fail.
One minute you're standing on solid ground.
The next minute... you're not.
Baby's up.
You change the diaper. I'll get the bottle.
And there's always two versions...
Yours...
And theirs.
So they're living together
at your house,
Kepner says.
This is my house.
Did she say how they're doing?
No. I didn't ask.
I don't care.
You...
You want me to ask, for you?
No. I don't care, either.
Hand me a rock.
Okay. I'm--I can't--I can't--I can't.
Um, I can't have sex when there's a baby
from a broken home in the next room.
I...
Both versions start the same way, though.
Both start with two people falling in love.
Yeah, you can.
Just look at me.
It's just you and me.
Dude... you snore like a truck.
I'm gonna put a note in your chart,
'cause you mix apnea with your heart crap,
and you're dead before you're 60.
Excuse me.
You guys going to that breakfast thing?
Uh, yeah, after we drop her off at day care.
Oh, my God. Look at her. She's so beautiful.
Hey, you are so beautiful... here you go.
And you've got the best mommies.
Did you know that? Yes, you do.
Oh, you do.
Oh, you so do.
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
What is wrong with her?
Mm, she's getting laid. She's unnaturally cheerful.
Oh. Yes, you do. Peekaboo.
A month ago you were in med school
being taught by doctors.
And now you are the doctors.
Will we be going into an O.R. today?
Oh, I hope so.
Oh. New interns.
I hate new interns.
Seriously?
I love new interns.
They're the future,
the next generation...
filled with hope and promise, innovation.
The sex with Henry must be really good.
Earth-shattering.
Shit.
Not even Yang's gonna get me down.
No, she's not.
Good morning,
and welcome to your fifth year of residency.
Oh, morning.
Morning.
See you guys up there.
I hear there's an omelet station.
Thank you. Okay.
You have a good day.
Okay, now. Bye-bye.
Okay, um, I'll see you later...
Okay.
at the thing.
She slept through the night...
Hey, Zola.
and ate like a champ.
I missed you.
Can we talk?
I want to spend time with Zola
before I drop her off at day care.
Are you gonna call Glen today?
I don't know.
I, you know, the--the guy is an ass.
Do I really want to work for him?
Maybe you should stop being so choosy.
Well, I just got laid off four months ago. All right?
I mean, these things take time.
It's all about pursuing leads and making connections.
I know how a person gets a job, Danny.
I have one, remember?
Good morning, and, uh,
welcome to your final year of residency.
Um...
This--this breakfast is the one time
when all the fifth years and the attendings will be in the same room,
so...so use your time wisely, residents...
Find a mentor...
ask questions, get advice on your futures.
And, um, I see you're already chatting away,
so that's--that's good.
Just carry on.
Dr. Bailey, how did you do it?
I put down the English muffin first,
then the bacon, then the eggs.
Oh, no--
Now some people may be surprised by this method,
thinking you put the bacon on top of the eggs,
and those people
would be right, because...
You see what I'm doing?
Bam!
An extra layer of bacon
right on top.
Then you put on the other half of the muffin.
And there you go. That's a breakfast sandwich.
Uh, no, no, I, uh, I mean,
how did you get people to listen to you
as chief resident?
Dr. Kepner, I am eating. Leave me alone with my food.
Figure it out on your own.
Did he talk to you?
No, he won't even look at me.
Well... you tampered with his clinical trial.
He thinks that's kind of unforgivable.
It was for Adele and the chief--
You know, I know you--
you regret that you messed up his trial
but not what you did, I know.
You don't have to defend yourself to me.
I'm kind of...
unforgivable myself, remember?
But you're not. Not yet at least.
Have you told him?
Well...
I call him, he doesn't pick up.
He sees me, he walks away.
Okay, I'm not gonna yell
"I didn't get the abortion yet" down the hallway.
Well, so are you going to go through with it,
or are we gonna sit there again and not get the abortion?
Tonight. 6:00. I'm doing it.
Gotta go suck up to Teddy.
You want plastics?
I don't see it.
Is this about Lexie?
'cause I thought you were good with that.
This isn't about sex. It's about medicine.
Then I don't understand.
You're a good surgeon.
Not a great surgeon,
which is why I was surprised Lexie was even into you.
But this isn't about Lexie.
Nope.
How's she doing, by the way?
God. What is she doing here?
I don't...what?
Is what you're thinking, right?
I mean, you thought that I would run away to Germany
and you wouldn't have to see me again,
which was a relief, I mean,
after all the drama that we've been through in the last year.
I'm right. Tell me I'm right.
I...
Okay, so here's the deal -- I'm here
and I'm in a happy place and I'm done with drama.
So if you want to learn, I want to teach.
Great.
Yay.
Alex, this is serious.
If you want the peds fellowship next year,
you're gonna have to earn it.
I just brought over a bunch of sick kids from Africa.
Well, did you publish and article about it?
Because all the people applying for peds fellowships,
they've all been published.
You're already getting resumes?
Yes, and you're way behind.
Listen, I hate to kick a guy when he's down, but--
Down? Who's down? I'm not down?
Everybody hates you because you narced on a fellow surgeon.
You're a pariah. You're living in the hospital,
and you look like a bum and you've...
got really bad breath.
Really...
really bad.
Do you need me to go on? I...
No, I'm good.
Look, here's the chief!
Chief,
is there, uh, anything you'd like to say
as we embark on our final year of residency?
You all know what you're doing.
Just don't kill anyone.
Meredith, can I see you in my office?
Well, that w--that was very... inspirational.
Thank you, Chief.
Nobody gets married thinking it's gonna fail.
Well, you're the one who needed the big wedding.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means, if we still had our savings,
my being laid off wouldn't be such a big deal.
No, we decided on that together.
We both wanted that wedding.
No, we didn't.
You and your mother are the--
Stop the car.
Calm down.
I mean it, Danny.
You're being crazy.
What, are you gonna walk to work from here?
What the hell are you doing?
Stop the car!
You think yours is the one that's gonna make it.
Derek's refusing to work with me, isn't he?
The board met this morning.
They feel that a suspension
would send the wrong message.
They feel that what you did
disgraced the hospital...
the profession.
I'm sorry, I did everything I could.
So what are you saying?
You're fired,
effective immediately.
You're no longer a doctor at Seattle Grace.
And so it always comes as a shock...
The moment when you realize, it's over.
You walk away, and I swear, that's it.
All right, I am not gonna chase after you.
You get out of this car, and we are done.
Susannah!
One minute you're standing on solid ground.
The next minute you're not.
We're going to the scene of an onsite amputation
Woman's trapped under her car.
You guys are gonna get swamped with bodies.
Kepner, you're in charge till I get back.
Yes, sir. Have fun.
At an amputation?
I meant good luck.
You know what? There's bound to be piles of head trauma.
Derek's gonna have to talk to you.
I got fired.
What?
The chief fired me.
You son of a bitch.
I mean, are you happy now?
'cause this is all because of you.
You and your big fat, stupid mouth!
Get off me. Get off!
Kepner, control your people.
Stop! Stop!
All your fault!
Get off.
There's no hitting. No hitting.
Would you stop right now?
You going to the scene?
Yes.
Wait. Wait. I didn't tell you you could go. I need you here.
42-year-old female. Lost consciousness en route.
Unable to get airway secondary to tracheal injury.
Last B.P. is 89 over 60.
Don't worry. We'll figure something out.
Make sure there is a crike tray set up with the intubation kit.
Yes, doctor.
Come on. You can't be here. You need to go.
It's not stable. Get away from there.
Dr. Torres?
Yeah.
Dr. Hunt?
Karen Lorenz, in charge of search and rescue.
We're still pulling victims out of the debris,
but we have a couple-- Danny and Susannah Wilson--
stuck down there.
He has a head wound and his ankle's messed up,
but I don't see any other obvious injuries.
We could potentially bring him up,
but he won't leave without his wife,
and her leg is stuck under the car.
Take it easy. You'll be all right.
I hope you've got me with a decent resident.
I'm not babysitting any first-day first years today.
Yep, I got you with Meredith.
Coming through.
Wait. Um, that's not gonna--that's okay.
Uh, not a problem. I can fix this.
Uh, Jackson, can I get you with Bailey today?
I'm already with Sloan. Sorry.
Uh, okay. Uh, Yang. Yang.
Can I get you to...
No.
Okay.
Um, sorry. Hang on.
Let me just, um... just figure this out.
Hey, Grey. You're with me.
Yes, ma'am.
Uh, okay. Great. There we go.
Dr. Kepner, three more coming in.
Okay.
It was a water main break on 3rd.
Probably been going on for weeks, and it just gave way.
Here you go.
Thanks.
We've got a vitals monitor and a camera,
so we have a visual.
Danny, can you hear me?
She's--she's not talking anymore.
You gotta--you gotta get down here. We need help.
Danny, Danny, I'm Dr. Hunt.
Can you read out for me the top three numbers on the monitor?
87.
63.
122.
B.P.'s 87 over 63.
She's shocky. How do we get down to her?
You don't. It's too unstable.
The whole thing would cave in if we sent you down there.
By the time we get it shored up enough
to get someone down there, she'll be dead for sure.
I thought that's why we're here, for the amputation.
You're gonna talk him through it.
You want him to cut off his wife's leg?
Hey, you guys, I think she's dying.
You gotta get us outta here! Please hurry. Hurry!
Dr. Yang, can you tell me why you entered the pleura
with a kelly clamp?
Why? What's wrong?
Am I too low?
Do you suspect a traumatic herniation?
No, no. I just want to know you're thinking.
'Cause that's how you put a chest tube in.
Why?
What do you mean, why?
So you don't kill the person when you do it wrong.
Well, tell me like I'm an idiot.
Uh, like I'm a medical student.
Why?
I need to make sure that your foundation is solid.
Why?
I'm asking the questions, Cristina, not you.
Tell me why you entered the pleura that way.
What? Is Zola all right?
It's not...it's... She's fine. It's me.
I have to go.
Derek.
Meredith, I can't. I just--I...
I got fired.
What did you think was gonna happen?
Danny, you've got a kit.
Now they're sending down a second harness.
The doctors are gonna talk you through this, okay?
Okay.
What can I do?
Kepner called. She wants you back at the hospital.
I can't go back there.
Yeah, it sucks that everyone hates you,
but you're not hiding out here. Go.
Did you get the kit open?
Almost.
Oh, my God. No.
No. No, no. No, no, no. I-I-I can't do this.
Danny, Danny, you can do this.
We have one chance to bring you both up.
In order to do that, you have to amputate Susannah's leg.
Oh, no. No.
Oh, God. Oh.
I need a C-spine!
Coming through, people. Come on. Watch your back.
You guys headed back?
Yeah, we are.
Does anybody have a kid?
Has anybody seen a kid around?
Where'd they pull this guy from?
We'll need immediate transport for her.
Yeah, give me just a minute here, doctor.
I just gotta stabilize her.
I need some help over here!
He's not breathing.
Get an ambu bag and some oxygen over here.
Right away, doctor.
Oh, jeez. What happened?
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I need help.
I-I think my patient's coding.
You think your patient's coding?
What's his rhythm?
S.V.T.?
Sinus tach?
Okay, there shouldn't be a question mark at the end of that sentence.
I don't know. I'm freaking out.
It's my first day of internship. How could this be happening?
Go back to your patient. Does he have a pulse?
He has a pulse.
Good. Now check for breath sounds.
Uh, I kinda hear some,
but maybe the right sounds less?
You gotta stop with the questions.
It kinda looks like he's barely breathing at all now.
Move, move, move.
Tension pneumothorax. Grab the biggest needle you can find.
What are you doing?
Tension pneumo. This guy's freaking out.
Step away, Grey.
Uh... 14-guage? 16-guage?
The biggest needle you can find!
Okay. Get this man a chest tube.
And next time, call your resident.
I'm sorry. I-I thought that she was a resident.
No, she is not a resident.
She was fired by this hospital.
Had this man died under her care,
the hospital would be sued. You would be sued.
Hell, maybe even I would be sued.
Now get this man a chest tube, and, Grey,
get the hell outta here.
Pulse is not good. His breath sounds are shallow.
His name's Nicky Hoffman.
Pulse is minimal on this side, too.
Come on, Nicky. I need you to do better than this.
Thready pulses,
multiple rib fractures with decreased respirations.
His body's shutting down.
Could be compartment syndrome.
That could be why his radial pulses are so decreased.
We need to do bilateral fasciotomies
and relieve the pressure.
Do we have a scalpel?
Push 5 of morphine.
Got it.
Okay.
All right.
Okay, you do the fasciotomies.
You're the fifth year.
All right.
Okay, his pulse is stronger now.
Good. Do the other one.
Sponge.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Nice job. You got this?
Yeah, all right.
Hey.
Hey, Nicky. I'm Alex.
I'm a doctor.
You had a pretty bad accident.
We need a Gunther.
Dr. Bailey, it's the first day of fifth year.
And they're at each other's throats.
We need a Gunther.
I've got more pressing problems.
I'm trying to find a new spot for Meredith Grey.
You know, I heard they have a new research fellowship
at Mass Gen.
I thought a recommendation from you might--
You want me to write a recommendation
for Meredith Grey?
By the end of the day would be fine.
"To whom it may concern,
"Meredith Grey is an excellent example
"of the kind of resident
"you absolutely should not hire.
"She undermines groundbreaking clinical trials,
"she has absolutely no respect for rules, authority,
"or, as it turns out,
"the oath that she took when she became a doctor.
"She will most likely tarnish the reputation of you,
"your doctors, and your hospital.
Sincerely, Dr. Miranda Bailey."
Meredith Grey is the reason
we need a Gunther.
Jerry Hoffman.
C.T. showed a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.
I cleaned and splinted his humerus fracture
and sutured his facial lacerations.
Well, he won't need surgery, but let's do a neuro exam
every two hours just to make sure.
Let's take a look at your handiwork.
Oh, dear God.
My grandmother could sew up a stuffed turkey...
better than this.
It was...
pretty, uh, jagged in there, so--
You ever heard of burying your stitches?
All right.
So I will fix it.
Oh, Jackson.
There's a new patient in Bed 3.
Kinda busy, April.
Yeah, kinda busy turning this guy into Frankenstein.
Go. Go. Make yourself useful.
All right, I'm gonna fix this.
Mm-hmm.
Don't you think you're being a little hard on the kid?
He's a lightweight.
Be thankful you have Meredith.
She was fired.
She okay?
I don't know.
Mr. Hoffman? Dr. Shepherd.
You're at seattle grace hospital.
There was an accident. A sinkhole collapsed.
My son?
Nicky's on his way in.
He's had some severe injuries that they need me to assess,
but I promise you, I'm gonna take good care of your son.
Nicky Hoffman, sustained crush injuries
and was very unstable in the field.
Robbins is holding a trauma room.
We called Shepherd from the field.
Which one are they in?
Oh, god. I-I don't-- I don't know.
Well, find out.
Well, it's supposed to be on the board.
People, I need you to make sure you're updating these boards.
April, I need you to reassign these cases.
Uh, Yang, take over Meredith's cases.
No.
Cristina.
I'm with Altman,
and Meredith should keep her cases.
I am your chief resident.
You have to do what I say.
April, it's fine.
I can wait. Just sign them when you have a minute.
You're just gonna give up?
I was fired.
So what are you gonna do about it?
You have to go talk to the board.
The board fired me.
Yang.
What are you doing?
I presented as thirsty,
so... treated the symptoms with 8 ounces of water.
Now that I'm finished,
I will place this bottle in the recycling bin
so as to avoid excess strain on Seattle's landfills.
That's funny. You're a funny girl.
Come on. We have patients.
You need a plan. Come up with a plan.
Okay, now pour on that brown soap.
And pick up the thin silver knife.
Good.
Okay, now here's the thing--
You're gonna have to really put your weight into it.
Try for smooth cuts, okay?
Okay.
Now you see that area just below the tourniquet?
That's where you're gonna cut.
Do it horizontally, as deep as you can.
Are...are you...
are you--are you sure she's not gonna feel anything?
No, she's unconscious, Danny. She won't feel a thing.
Okay.
I-I can't.
Danny...
take that blue towel
and cover her face.
It'll help.
All right, now remember to put your weight behind it, okay?
Here we go.
One...
Two...
three.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Ah. I-I hit-- I hit bone.
I-I think I hit bone.
That's good. That's good.
Okay, put the scalpel down now.
Now take the curved clamp
and move it back and forth beneath the bone.
God. God, I-I can't. Uh, it--it won't--
Put your hand in the incision to get more traction.
I can't.
Danny, I know this is hard,
but we need to create more space
so you'll be able to saw through her bone.
No, I-- No, I-I can't.
Okay? This--this is my wife. All right?
I-I--I'm gonna kill her.
She's bleeding now--
Danny, you can't stop.
No, you need to come down here. I can't do this.
I won't do this!
I'm going down.
No, Dr. Hunt, I can't let you go down there.
He can't do it.
Yes, he can.
He can't. We are asking too much.
I'm going.
If it starts to go,
I'm bringing you--
I should go. I'm the orthopedic surgeon.
You have a wife and a child.
I'm going.
You're breaking up. Can you repeat that?
What?
I have a plan.
Okay.
I'm gonna be a mom.
Okay... Mer, there's a giant sinkhole.
Teddy is all over me.
Don't page me 9-1-1 unless you have a serious--
This is serious.
Maybe getting fired was a good thing.
What do you cheerful people say
when something crappy happens
and they make it sound like it wasn't crappy?
A blessing in disguise?
Yeah. Maybe that's what this is.
This is that.
And I can...
make jam and drive car pool
and have playgroups.
And maybe that's enough.
And maybe I'll be a great mom.
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go vomit.
Uh, call me when Meredith comes back.
And maybe you want to be a mom, too,
and that's why you can't go through with it.
I wish I wanted a kid.
I wish I wanted one so bad,
'cause then this would be easy.
I would be happy.
I'd have Owen,
and my life wouldn't be a mess.
But I don't.
I don't want a kid.
I mean, I don't want to make jam.
I-I don't want to carpool.
I really, really, really don't want to be a mother.
I want to be a surgeon, and please...
get it.
I need someone to get it.
And I wish that someone was Owen.
I wish that--that--that at any minute,
he'll get it and show up for me,
but that's not gonna happen.
And you're my person.
I need you to be there at 6:00 tonight
to hold my hand,
'cause I am scared, Mere,
and sad,
'cause my husband doesn't get that.
So I need you to.
I am a terrible person.
I know, awful.
I got Meredith's surgeries.
I'm reaping joy from the fact that my sister got fired.
A terrible person wouldn't feel terrible about reaping the joy.
Oh, uh, Jackson, Jackson,
I need you to take over on a couple of these.
I can't.
I have to see a man about redoing some sutures.
Please.
I'll take one.
Thank you. Bed 4.
Bailey needs her spleen patient taken to the O.R.
Uh... he's in Bed 3.
So... he just, um, he needs a consent form.
Make sure that the consent form gets put on his chart.
Uh, right.
Zola, peekaboo.
Peekaboo.
Hi, Janet.
Hey, Meredith.
I'm just finishing up your home study,
and I thought I'd check and see how Zola's doing.
She is doing great.
I heard about the sinkhole on the radio.
I figured you'd be busy today.
Yeah, I'm just, uh, in between surgeries.
So... how are things going?
Is she sleeping through the night?
No, I--not really.
Um, she's up a few times. But it's fine. I don't mind.
Just you, or are you guys taking turns?
No, he's great with her. He's--Derek's great with her.
Dr. Grey, are you taking Zola home now?
Because it says here that Dr. Shepherd's got her tonight.
Wait. I don't understand. You two aren't together?
No. We are.
We take turns dropping her off and picking her up.
I'm not taking her home.
I just came to, uh, to--to say hi.
I actually should get back to work.
Okay, Zola. I'm gonna go.
Okay.
It was nice to see you, Janet.
You, too, Meredith.
How's Nicky doing?
I gotta do my final exploration,
Check for any missed bleeders, and then I'm out.
The kid had a renal artery thrombosis.
I thought his kidney was a goner,
But Alex did an interposition graft and saved it.
He's doing an amazing job.
I need to stabilize his spinal fracture.
So what do you got, about another hour or so?
Well, with the rock star over here, you never know.
I'd keep your pager close by.
Dr. Shepherd.
Janet Meyers with Social Services
needs to speak with you.
Oh, what now?
She's waiting in the lobby.
I heard about Meredith. I'm sorry.
But you know, Meredith's strong, you're strong.
You're gonna make it through
Could you guys just keep it down?
I'm trying to concentrate. Please.
All right. Just page me when you're ready, okay?
I'm so--I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Danny?
I'm sorry.
Danny, look at me.
You're doing great.
Now I need you...
I need you to cover her head.
Keep her head safe, all right?
All right.
I couldn't do it. I c--I couldn't--
I couldn't do it. I couldn't.
Danny, you did it.
You did the hard part.
All right?
Now, Danny...
Danny, look away.
All right, she's free. Good job.
I'm gonna finish up,
and we'll both be right behind you.
All right?
Take him up.
Meredith, what'd you say to Janet?
Nothing. Why?
I just finished answering a whole slew of questions
about Zola's sleeping arrangements.
She's finishing her home study.
That's routine.
Okay, there was nothing routine
when she said that there were inconsistencies with our stories.
What did she say?
She said that she spoke to you and that some red flags went up.
Well, I did see her earlier, but I didn't say anything.
I gotta go. I got a surgery.
Well, I'll--I'll talk to Janet and I'll--
No. Don't. Don't do anything.
Don't talk to her. I will talk care of this.
You've already... don't talk to her.
Dr. Sloan, I think you're gonna be really impressed
By the buried sutures I did here.
After you.
That is impressive. It is.
Gender reassignment, huh?
Normally they don't teach that till next year.
That's a mistake. This is not--
Call me when you find the right patient.
I don't have time for this.
Hey, uh, I need you to prep Trauma 1.
We got another sinkhole victim on the way.
Stop asking me to do your work. Do it yourself.
And how about you tell me where Jerry Hoffman is?
Jerry Hoffman?
Um, uh, well, he's supposed to be in Bed 1.
That's what the board says. He's not there?
Does it look like he's there?
Oh, wait. Wait. That can't be right,
'cause if the patient from Bed 2 is in Bed 1.
hen that means the patient from Bed 3 must be...
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
The patient is Mr. Chuck Wallace.
He's having a splenectomy secondary to
injuries sustained in the sinkhole.
Yes, Dr. Grey,
let's move on before my patient bleeds out.
Okay, I'm almost ready Dr. Bailey.
I just have to have the nurse
show me the consent form as part of the checklist.
Scalpel.
Wait a second.
Dr. Grey,
you're sterile. What are you--
Okay, hold--hold on.
Wait a minute. I'm--
I think that there-- something might be... off.
I'm thinking that maybe this is...
not our patient.
Then whose patient is it?
I don't--I don't-- I don't--I don't know.
I just--I--
You don't know?
I'm holding a scalpel in my hand.
I think you had better find out.
Stop! Don't cut!
Uh, it's the wrong patient.
That's Mr. Jarvis, who needs a lung resection,
Not Mr. Wallace with a splenic hemorrhage.
I-I'm--I'm sorry.
I-I-I am so, so sorry.
Would you make sure this gets to
the medical staff office, please?
Yes, doctor.
Meredith.
What?
Nothing.
Grey, we've got a guy with severe crush injuries,
And Callie's come in with a field amputation.
Let's move.
We gotta get these trauma rooms ready--
I got fired.
Okay? I got fired.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Yeah, well, now you know.
I have to go. I have a...
Owen.
She didn't have the abortion.
She wants to and she can't do it because of you,
because she loves you.
And instead of loving her,
you're punishing her.
For what?
For being the woman that you fell in love with?
This isn't any of your business.
Okay,
do you know what will happen to Cristina
if she has a kid that she doesn't want?
It will almost kill her.
Trying to pretend that she loves a kid as much as she loves surgery
will almost kill her,
and it'll almost kill your kid.
Do you know what it's like to be raised by someone
who didn't want you?
I do.
To know you stood in the way of your mother's career?
I do.
I was raised by a Cristina.
My mother was a cristina.
And as the child she didn't want,
I am telling you, don't do this to her,
because she's kind and she cares
and she won't make it.
The guilt of resenting her own kid
will eat her alive.
All right. Coming through.
No one was updating the board,
even though I kept telling them to.
I know, I know. I-I-I have to make people listen to me,
but in all fairness
I've been chief resident for 12 hours, and--
and yes. A man could've lost-- his perfectly good spleen,
but he didn't,
because the checklist I implemented.
Not that-- that excuses what happened, I--
It's okay, just--
yell at me.
I can take it.
It's okay.
No, I-I--I can-- I can take it.
Really. I-I swear, I can take it. I--
How deep are you placing the tube?
21 centimeters
exactly.
Hallelujah, I'm in.
Great.
Now explain why you chose that size endotracheal tube.
Because I'm in my fifth year of residency
and I know what size tube to use for a basic intubation.
Why are you treating me like a first year?
Because no one ever did.
I bet your first year,
you could do things better than most third years.
Well, yes, I could. Why are you punishing me for it?
I'm happy.
That makes me see you differently.
Your arrogance is not your fault.
You're arrogant because you're so good.
People let you slide by, skip steps.
They gave you the hard stuff
But let you skip the easy stuff.
I have no doubt that you can tell me
how to do a coronary artery bypass.
But I'm not sure that you can tell me
why you chose that size endotracheal tube.
Look, I know what you heard,
but Meredith Grey is one of the most qualified...
Yeah, I understand.
Yeah. Thank you for your time.
Not now, Karev. I'm in no mood.
You need to get Meredith her job back.
What do you think I've been doing?
I've spent the whole morning trying to get her a job.
Meredith doesn't need a job.
She needs this job.
It's not gonna happen.
The board's already made their decision.
Let me talk to them.
I mean, maybe I don't know what I saw.
Maybe I-I-I-I lied
to get the chief resident--
I can't let you say that.
Oh, the hell you can't.
Karev, this is not on you.
Yeah, it is.
It's all on me.
Looks perfect, Jerry.
Second time's the charm.
Sutures look a lot better.
Really?
That's great.
No. No, no. Not great.
Better.
Which isn't saying much considering the crappy job
you did the first time.
You--you just said it looked a lot better, s--
This guy just fell into a sinkhole,
his kid's in surgery,
And now he's got a scar
to remind him of this terrible day
for the rest of his life.
You want to go tell him that,
big shot?
Go ahead.
Dr. Sloan.
Is Nicky out of surgery?
Uh, Dr. Avery was just about to go check on that.
Wait. Bailey paged you, too?
Any idea why?
Who cares?
As long as it gets me away from Altman.
Oh, God.
She's gonna fire us, isn't she?
Why would she fire us?
There was that patient mix-up in the O.R.
Oh. You should be fired.
Me? You guys didn't update the board.
That's why she looks so pissed off.
That's not good for it.
Uh, let me see that chart.
What is she looking for?
What have you got?
A field amputation with complicated extrications.
Still assessing her multiple crush injuries,
but I felt a broken pelvis for sure,
and her B.P.'s in the toilet.
Yeah, this is a Gunther.
Really?
Really.
Think they can handle a Gunther?
Oh, I think they need a Gunther.
Uh, what's a Gunther?
Hey. I got your message. What's up?
We should wait till your husband gets here.
You paged Derek?
Well, he's in surgery. That could take hours.
Can't you at least tell me what this is about?
I could tell something was up
when I ran into you at Zola's day care
so I made some calls.
It would have been better
if you told me that you had been fired
and that you and Dr. Shepherd were living apart.
But I can explain--
I'm sure you can.
But you understand my concern.
So--so what happens now? Worst-case scenario.
Let's not even go there.
Well, they couldn't take Zola, right?
I'm not really comfortable
discussing this without your husband.
Well, this is urgent, so I'll go get him
and I will be right back.
Do you have what it takes?
If your marriage is in trouble, can you weather the storm?
When the ground gives way...
and your world collapses...
He's losing his S.S.E.P.s,
push I.V.steroids.
Maybe you just need to have faith...
Scrub in. I need you.
I just got your page.
And trust that you can survive this together.
Maybe you just need to hold on tight...
Oh, what did I do?
What did I do?
And no matter what...
What did I do?
Don't let go.
