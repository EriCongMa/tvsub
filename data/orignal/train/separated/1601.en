Where'd you get the phone?
Brandon was right.
I'm glad you're back in touch with Ty.
All I ask is that you keep me in the loop.
Mariana...
Ana... She put us all through a lot.
It's gonna take time to trust her.
I would like to buy myself a car.
For now, the answer is no.
Happy birthday!
I saved it from my quinceanera and my allowance...
So you can get a car that moms will approve.
But what if we bought a car together?
I'm in.
I was talking to my pianist, Jin...
And I said, what a raw deal I thought you got.
So that means I'm back in?
You had sex with Wyatt?
It only happened once.
And what about lying to me? Is that a one time thing, too?
"Super Callie?" You're such a dork.
So, what kind of powers does super Callie have?
Does she fly?
She doesn't just fly...
It's more like... gravitation of manipulation.
Like riding gravity waves.
Yeah, she flies.
And why do you only...
draw, like, superheroes?
I understand those kinda stories.
What? Are you about to tell me you're like...
like captain america or something?
No.
I guess I just spent a long time hoping that
I'm more than what the world thinks of me.
Well, thank you...
For the... for the drawing.
It's my favorite birthday gift.
It's your favorite?
Wait. Is that him?
Lookin' good, mister man!
Ty, this is Callie.
She's the girl that got me with her foster family.
I appreciate you lookin' out for my baby bro, Callie.
It's been hard for him being the less handsome Hensdale boy...
It's nice to meet you, Ty.
Um, I'm gonna go meet Mariana, but I'll see you at home.
All right.
I see you got yourself a little shorty.
Oh, there ain't nothing going on.
So, does she know?
Know what?
That we're leaving.
Okay.
I guess these belong to you now.
Ah! Thank you.
Ooh! Don't forget to move your car for street cleaning.
Those tickets are a racket!
Thank you for the heads up.
Oh, my god!
I can't believe we just bought a car.
So...
What should we name her?
How about "Lucille"?
She looks like a Lucille.
Do you want to break her in? I could use a ride to work.
Well, I can't drive you anywhere until we have insurance.
And since we're not 18, that's gonna require telling moms.
Okay. Well, do you wanna break the news then?
Mariana, it's not that simple.
We can't just tell moms we bought a car,
and then hit them up for money for insurance.
That stuff's expensive.
Okay.
Between the two of us, it shouldn't take long to save up.
Yeah, until then, Lucille has to stay parked on the street.
Okay, fine.
I guess I'll just ride the bus.
I guess you will, huh?
Callie, is that you?
Yeah!
Could you come here, please?
Um... What are you...
We asked Rita to stop by
because we wanted to talk to her about you and A.J.
Um, what about us?
I saw the two of you kiss, after the party.
Uh... Okay, it only happened that once.
And I know that nothing... we can't...
while he's living here, so...
Do you like A.J.?
I don't know how I feel.
But I do know that I don't want a bunch of...
drama again.
And yet, here we are.
Honey, we just...
We can't risk anything affecting your adoption.
The only way to protect everyone...
is to separate you and A.J.
You guys can't live in this house together.
So, what are you gonna do?
So, the plan is, we share Jin.
The three of us agreed to a Chinese wall.
No pun intended.
I'm completely neutral.
I promise I won't say anything about what the other's working on.
You sure you're okay taking on two composers?
It's a lot of extra work.
It's also two shots to play at Disney Hall.
All right, then.
Welcome back, Brandon.
Thank you for giving me another shot, guys. Seriously.
This place is crazy and everyone's so intense.
It's nice to make some real friends.
No worries, man.
We gotta look out for each other when we can.
Shouldn't he be home by now?
Well, I'm sure he's just running late.
Do you feel like you need me to stick around?
No, I got it.
And I think it's better if I talk to him alone.
All right.
How'd it go with Ty?
Um, it was good.
He really wants to meet you,
like we talked about. That's okay, right?
Yeah.
All right.
I just want him to see that you're cool and everything.
Yeah, of course. Any time.
Listen, uh,
there's something else we need to talk about.
Well, whatever happened to that girl? What was her name? Kat?
Oh, yeah. Um, she got kicked out
and went back to Toronto.
Wow! So, what's your story, A.J.?
What kind of stuff are you into?
Oh! He's a really good artist.
Yeah?
He did this super-awesome
superhero drawing for Callie's birthday.
What did you call her?
Um, super Callie.
That's funny. Callie, how's your app coming...
that whole, you know, work-study independent thing?
Well, it's fine. Actually, I have to present
for the advisor's board tomorrow.
Fingers crossed. But, no, I'm like, really excited about it.
I picked up a bunch of coding from Mariana.
That's cool. What's coding? Seriously. No, what is it?
Well, we have a little bit of an announcement...
A.J. is not going to be staying with us any longer.
He isn't?
He's going to be staying with Rita.
Yes.
Just until I get my foster license.
Why?
Uh, our license is expired,
and with Callie's adoption coming up soon,
You know, we're not going to take the courses to renew.
We just have a lot on our plates right now.
Yeah, and I'm happy to host A.J.
at my place for a couple of weeks.
When are you leaving?
Oh, Rita has just gotta get a quick home-study from CPS.
So, probably a day or two.
Yeah.
Well, we'll be sorry to see you go.
We really will.
At least there'll be one less
person in the bathroom in the morning, right?
You said it.
That's positive thinking.
Well, I was gonna wait for Jude to get back from Connor's
to make my big announcement,
But it seems like we kinda need some good news.
So...
Ana asked me to be Isabella's godmother.
Oh, honey!
Well, that's really great, love.
That's a great honor.
It sure is.
And Isabella's not the only one that's gonna get baptized.
Meaning?
I am, too.
In the catholic church?
Yeah.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I mean no.
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you're thinking,
but this is not Brandon all over again.
Okay, this thing with A.J.... Yeah, it shouldn't have happened,
But it's not like I'm in love with him.
Okay.
Listen...
I've been doing really, really good on my food plan.
Really. I've been, like, dieting and exercising and...
Um, I lost a little bit of weight. Thanks so much for noticing.
Okay?
Uh, last week,
I ate a cake.
Not a piece of cake.
An entire cake.
Right? And I didn't even really enjoy it.
And I felt so bad about myself.
I'm like, "Rita, why did you do that?
Why did you eat the whole cake?" Then I realized.
It was a habit.
I did it because it's a habit.
And habits...
They are really hard to break. Right?
You gotta be smart, Callie.
You can't go through life just repeating the same mistakes.
I won't. I promise.
Promise?
Promise.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm sorry... about all this.
I mean, it's not fair.
It's not all bad. Maybe if I'm at Rita's,
we can...
No, we can't.
I have a lot going on right now.
And I really... I just need to focus on myself.
Okay. Yeah.
I get it.
I just... I don't get the big deal.
Didn't you baptize Brandon?
Yes...
But that was more for my father.
Well, why can't I do this for Ana and Victor?
Victor's just worried that...
if I don't, he won't see me in heaven.
Oh, my god.
Honey, that is just ridiculous.
Not to him.
And don't you think it's a good insurance policy?
I mean, just in case.
We don't believe in heaven and hell, Mariana.
Well, then what do we believe in?
It's not like we ever go to church. Do we even believe in god?
Well...
We believe in love.
And in a higher power that lives within all things.
One that inspires us
to be kind and compassionate to each other.
What we don't believe in, is an angry old man up in the sky,
threatening to send us to hell, if we don't do as he says.
I don't like the Gutierrezes scaring you.
I'm not scared.
And look, I know the Catholic church isn't,
like, pro-choice or whatever,
And it doesn't support gay marriage.
Or the use of contraception.
But I don't have to believe in any of that. I'm not converting.
I just... I want to be Isabella's godmother,
And I can't if I don't get baptized.
So, you sorry to see him go?
I know you aren't.
I mean, are you buying
the reasons moms say he has to go to Rita's?
Why? Aren't you?
Yeah, I mean, I guess so.
So, how's Idyllwild?
Uh, good. Well, I think.
I'm trying something kind of...
weird for my new piece.
Um, and I have to play a part of it in class this week,
And I'm just thinking it might be too risky.
So...
If you're asking my advice,
I don't know the black keys from the white ones,
But isn't there someone at Idyllwild that you trust?
Yeah...
I guess.
There you go.
So, what'd you think? Am I... Crazy? Be honest.
Prepared piano...
It's bold.
Too bold?
There's no such thing.
Is it risky? Hell, yeah.
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't play it.
Okay, but put yourself in my shoes here.
I'm not exactly in a position
to take risks, you know.
Not after they just barely let me back into the program.
I'm for it.
I've never heard anything like it played here.
But of course, I don't have a vote.
What would you do?
I still have time to convert it, you know,
Back to a traditional piece.
Ah! You know I can't make that decision for you, dude.
Look, you just gotta go with this.
You gotta go with your gut.
Right, yeah.
Go with my gut.
And what's your gut saying when you want to throw up?
Wait. So, your moms don't want you to be the godmother anymore?
Why not?
I don't know. I think it just kinda caught them off-guard.
They'll come around.
I hope so.
Abuelo victor's been talking about it all morning.
He's so excited.
Stop monitoring my every move!
Just tell me why you need a refill.
Those pills should've lasted you another week.
Because I ran out, okay?
I lost them and I needed some more.
It's none of your business anyway!
It is my business, Ana, if you are abusing your pain medication.
Well, I'm not! So, stop scrutinizing every single thing I do.
I just need some air.
Ana?
Back to work, mijas. Andale.
I'll be in the back.
Hey. What are you...
We would like to have a conversation with the gutierrezes,
if that's all right?
Our church provides us with a sense of community
and a sense of purpose.
We just wanted to share that with Mariana.
Is that so bad?
You told our daughter that she's going to hell.
I never said that.
Really?
Okay, but if you're afraid
that you won't meet her in heaven,
what other option is there, Victor?
If Mariana isn't baptized before she dies,
her soul will be in limbo.
And we don't want her to suffer, waiting for purification,
before she joins god in heaven.
We didn't mean to overstep.
Hey, um... My moms just want to talk about the baptism.
We wouldn't be in this position
if Ana had had her children baptized in the first place.
It's something I really regret.
We hear you, and we understand, Ana...
But here's the thing.
Jesus and Mariana are not your children.
Or your grandchildren.
You have a relationship with Mariana because we allow it.
It's not your place to parent her.
They're right. They're her parents.
I'm sorry. I should've asked permission before any of this.
Yes. Yes, you should have.
Fine. You're right. Absolutely.
But let me ask you something.
You don't go to church, right?
No, we don't.
So, do you not believe in god?
That's a fairly personal question, Elena.
Okay. Then, tell me this.
Is there any reason you
don't want your children to believe in god?
Ty. Mike.
Nice to finally meet you.
Can I get you something to drink?
Water's cool.
Okay.
So, he's a cop?
Ty, be cool.
So...
A lonely white cop wants to foster a black teen.
Oh, I've seen this movie before.
Let me guess. You're gonna save my brother from being dangerous,
violent, and criminally inclined, right?
I'm not interested in saving anybody.
I'm fostering a.J., so I can provide him with a home.
Until he ages out.
He's almost 18.
What?
You need a few months of government checks that bad?
Ty!
It's okay.
Look, I'm not just in this till he turns 18.
I'm not gonna just throw him out!
I want him to go to college, get an education.
I'm gonna support him any way I can.
Look, I'm not in this for just a few months. This is forever.
Foster kids have no control
over where they live,
who they live with.
So, this app, "Fost and found,"
will give them the access and
information they need, so they can have some power,
so they can make decisions for themselves.
Why can't they just look those things up on the internet?
Well, most foster kids
don't know what they need.
So, they don't know what to search for.
So, this web app will help direct them.
You know, like two organizations that provide
donated prom dresses or...
two dental clinics that provide free teeth cleanings.
There's even a summer camp for foster kids that's free.
But most of us don't even know these things exist.
I know I didn't.
That's all great stuff,
no doubt about it,
But your old independent study at the drop-in center
was so interactive.
You got such terrific face-to-face time with the kids.
This just seems so much less...
immersive.
So, how much longer were you at
that other foster house before you moved in here?
I'm actually moving out of that
house and into a different one for a little while.
Mike still hasn't gotten his foster license.
Say what now? Why are you moving around so much?
I kissed my foster sister.
Hold up. That Callie girl?
Why doesn't she have to move out?
Because...
Because the black kid kissed the white girl, and that's a big no.
That's not how it is, ty. One of her moms is black.
Whatever. They're moving
your ass out because they're gettin' rid of you.
They don't want you to have anything to do with that girl.
No, man. It's not like that.
Listen to me, A.J...
This Mike is not your forever father.
They are getting rid of you.
As sure as I'm sitting here.
As soon as you wake up
and realize that, you give me a call.
Hey! You guys hungry? Grub's up.
Great work, Brandon.
Really nice. Glad to have you back.
That's all we have time for.
We'll hear from the rest of you tomorrow.
Dude, that was sweet.
Really tight.
Thanks for, you know, the advice.
No, all I said was to follow your gut.
You can't go wrong with that.
Hey! So...
I liked your piece.
I really did,
but I feel like you're holding back, Brandon.
You've got to be more imaginative,
braver, and bolder.
This is the time to take chances.
You're not going to get anywhere, definitely not Disney Hall,
by playing it safe.
So, CPS did the home visit, so we're good to go.
Great!
I thought, maybe,
we could go over some house rules before we move you in tomorrow?
Okay.
So, I saw you and Brandon get into it at Callie's party.
And Mike told me
that you're talking to your brother and that's fine,
but there will be no lying.
Understood?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay.
I also know that you're the reason
that Callie got fired from the drop-in center.
What? What do you mean, callie got fired?
What happened?
It was before I even met you.
It's kinda how I ended up in detention.
What did you do?
She let me spend the night there,
and I took off.
Stole some spray paint.
I see.
She didn't want Stef and Lena to find out, so...
Okay.
Listen, didn't mean to narc on you there.
Okay?
But the point is,
There are no second chances with me.
There'll be no lying,
no stealing,
no running away, no fighting.
One strike and you're out.
You got it?
Got it.
I can't believe she had the nerve to ask us
if we didn't want our kids to believe in god.
What the hell was that?
And what the hell business is it of theirs?
I agree with you, love.
I totally, absolutely agree with you.
But you know,
we haven't exactly exposed our kids to anything.
We don't go to church. We don't pray.
I mean, is it our fault that Mariana went running
to the first person that talked to her about god?
No, no, no, no.
This was not an invitation to learn more about the catholic church.
This was... This was an ultimatum. This was blackmail.
Victor literally said,
you cannot be godmother if you're not baptized.
What is that?
It's their beliefs.
Well...
It's not their place to
impose their beliefs on our daughter.
I agree.
But, you know, we've always said
that we would allow our children
to choose their own spiritual paths.
I don't know. When does that... when does that start?
I should've told you about the drop-in center and everything.
Trying to protect Callie?
I know.
Look...
Are you interested in her?
Like, romantically?
Relax, it's not a trick question.
I honestly want to know.
Yeah, I guess.
I mean, I'm not sure she's interested in me,
but if she was, would that be a problem?
I mean, it's okay if I'm living with
you and Rita, right?
Look, I think Callie's a great girl...
Honest.
I just don't think...
Getting involved with her is a great idea.
How come?
She just has a lot of stuff to work out. And...
She comes with more than her fair share of drama.
There's just a lot of other girls out there, A.J...
I just think you might be better off.
That's all.
Good night.

Sorry I'm late.
She's been fussy all morning.
Here, let me.
So, have you talked to father Pena yet?
Uh, no, not yet.
Where are your moms?
Um, they're not coming.
So, are you okay?
I heard you and Elena fighting yesterday, and...
And you want to know if I'm abusing my pain killers.
I flushed them, the whole bottle.
I've been trying to live with the pain,
but I finally realized I can't.
So, I got a refill.
Why didn't you tell your mom that?
Because my parents only see me as an addict.
If they had the slightest idea
that I was worried about relapsing,
they'd be all over me.
So, you're cool?
I promise.
I...
I'm sorry this has caused so much trouble.
But I want you to know
how much it means to me,
not getting you and Jesus baptized
was just another reminder of the million ways
I was a terrible mother.
Look who's here.
You came.
Of course we came.
And we come bearing gifts.
One of those in there is for you,
and the other is for Isabella,
to commemorate your godmother-goddaughter bond.
So pretty. Thank you.
Mariana, are we ready?
Um, yes.
Father Pena, these are my moms.
Lovely to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure.
Shall we?
Now, I know you weren't raised in the church,
but I'm happy to see that
your reunion with your grandparents is...
My birth grandparents.
Of course. Um...
I'm happy to see that your reunion with your birth grandparents
has ignited an interest in a spiritual connection.
Normally, before we do this,
there's quite a bit of instruction,
but these are obviously very special circumstances.
So, then I'll bring you up and introduce you
as Mariana Gutierrez...
No, no, no. "Adams Foster."
Right. I'm sorry. I knew that.
I'm just getting everything wrong today, aren't I?
It's fine.
So, then, at the altar, you'll repeat after me,
and recite the following oath
before your congregation and god.
"I believe and profess all that the holy catholic church
believes, teaches, and proclaims,
to be revealed by god."
Is it a sin
to say the oath and not believe it?
Well, it is a sin to lie,
but what don't you believe?
Well, you met my moms.
They're married. Would the church accept them?
Of course. We welcome all sinners.
Rita told Mike I got you fired.
And then, he told me
that I'm supposed to stay away from you.
He said what?
And then, I realized that's why I'm going to Rita's.
I crossed the line.
I kissed the princess, and now, they want to keep me
as far away from you as they can.
Why would you say that?
What did he say?
He said that you had a lot of stuff to work out
and that I should keep my distance.
What, you think that's about you?
No, he's looking out for you, not me.
When I first got here...
Brandon and I, kind of, fell for each other.
That's why that guy hates my guts.
We fell in love...
But I needed a family, so we ended it.
I ended it.
That's probably why Mike said that. He was...
He probably doesn't want you to get hurt.
I'm not worried about getting my feelings hurt, Callie.
Besides, there's one big difference between me and Brandon.
I'm never gonna be your brother.
Damn it, I'm gonna get a ticket!
其中最大的是爱 出自《圣经》
What's this?
It's a gift for Bella from my moms.
But...
I have to tell you something.
What? When did this happen?
Just got it. My moms don't know yet.
I hate parallel parking.
What's the hurry? Let's take it for a spin.
Well, I can't drive until I get insurance.
Come on, let's take it around the block one time.
I'm sure we'll find a better parking spot.
Come on, girl! Let me see your skills.
So, you guys are really okay with this?
It's Mariana's choice, not ours.
Hey, sweetheart, the service is about to start.
What are you doing?
I'm not...
I'm not gonna get baptized.
Well, why not, love?
Because...
I'm not gonna stand up there and say that I believe in a church
that thinks my moms are sinners just for being gay.
I mean, am I a sinner because I'm straight?
No.
No, I'm not.
So, you're not gonna be Isabella's godmother?
It's okay.
I'll just keep looking out for her like I do.
I don't need a title for that.
Hey! Have you seen Ana?
What? What do you mean?
She said she was going to the restroom,
but I think she left.
I can't find her anywhere.
Good morning, everyone.
Okay. Who's up first?
We'd like to go first, if that's okay?
It's all yours.
Could you drive any slower?
I can't afford to get a ticket.
You know you can get aticket
for driving under the speed limit, right?
No way. Really?
So, you and Brandon...
That's over, right?
Like, you don't have a thing for him anymore?
Right.
So, you gonna drive this thing over to Rita's and visit me?
Maybe, if you're nice.
I'm always nice.
No, no, no, no, no. Oh, my god.
We've looked everywhere.
She's not answering her phone either.
I think she's using again.
Is that her?
No. I'm so sorry, I have to take this.
No, she's not using again.
I literally just talked to her about it.
Well, if it isn't her pain pills, then it's something else.
We've been down this road before with Ana.
Well, we just have to do this without her, come on.
Do what? Baptize Isabella?
No, you can't!
This is a family matter, Mariana.
You've made it quite clear you don't want to be a part of ours.
Sweetheart...
Ana hates me.
That is not what's happening here.
You're not responsible for any of this.
Okay. Yeah. I will be right there.
What? What is it? What happened?
Callie and A.J. have been arrested...
What?
...for stealing a car.
It's a fake.
But it's pink. It's called a pink slip, right?
We didn't exactly know what a title looks like.
No, of course you didn't. How could you?
You're teenagers.
I cannot believe you bought a stolen car.
This is why you don't do things like this
without talking to your parents.
Well, we were gonna tell you.
We just wanted to wait to have enough money for insurance.
Are you really looking at your phone right now?
Sorry, I just...
It's Adriana. Ana showed up to the reception. She's okay.
But do you think we're gonna get any of the money back?
I mean, they took the car.
Super bold piece, man.
I'm so glad everyone loved your idea.
Look, man. Sure...
I was inspired by what you played,
but prepared piano has been around forever.
It's not like you invented it.
That is such bull. You know it.
You never would've thought of that if it wasn't for me.
Are you buying this?
I'm Switzerland, all right?
Yeah, well, you know what the Swiss did in World WarⅡ?
Nothing. They just stood by and watched.
I mean, is that really who you wanna be, Jin?
Oh, chill out, Brandon.
Look, there were no war crimes committed.
Everyone went home last night,
and made adjustments based on Chris' critiques.
I was in a position to nad up and take a chance.
I'm not gonna apologize for that.
Man, that is so weak, it's actually pathetic.
Look who decided to grow a pair.
It's not my fault you don't believe in yourself.
Is that why you brought me back?
Because you don't think I'm a real threat?
Well, huge mistake, okay?
You might've gotten away with stealing my idea,
but we both know that my prepared piece
would've blown yours out of the water.
Okay? And if I ever had a doubt
about the fact that I belong here,
well, it's gone now, okay?
So, prepare for some serious competition, my friend,
'cause I'm about to own you.
I'll get it.
What do you wanna do for dinner?
Oh, god. I don't know. Should I run to the store?
I could do it.
Who is it, honey?
Hi, Ana.
I, um...
I think I made a mistake.
I want you to take Isabella.
I know you think that I left because I was using,
but it's not what happened.
I left because I couldn't...
stand up in front of all those people and...
promise to take care of my baby.
I know it's horrible, I do, but I just...
I feel no connection to her.
Look at all these parents,
and they seem so happy.
And that's not the way it is with me.
I just feel...
so empty.
This is the way I felt with you and Jesus.
And I always thought that it was the drugs.
But I guess...
I guess I'm just not meant to be a mother.
I think it...
It sounds like you might be suffering from postpartum depression.
Oh, is that her latest excuse?
This is a very real thing, Victor.
Women have been known to struggle with it, sometimes for months,
after having given birth.
Please!
Why do you do that?
Why do you always assume the worst of her?
Look, I may not have been raised in a church,
but my moms have always taught me to believe in family,
and to believe in people,
and to believe in the best possible version of people.
And that's what Ana needs right now.
For you to have faith in her.
She needs your love and support.
You don't know what we've been through with her.
I do.
She stole money from me. She lied to me.
But I still believe in her.
You can't just assume she's using again,
every time she has a bad day.
I guess we have been guilty of that,
but you have to understand...
No excuses. You either believe in her or you don't.
It's no secret that I've had my problems with the Catholic church,
but one thing that I think is so beautiful,
that they get really, really right,
is forgiveness.
Absolute forgiveness for ourselves, for others.
I think we all deserve that.
I hope you know, Mija...
We really do want you to succeed.
I just don't want to feel this way anymore.
So, we'll get you some help.
What a day, huh?
Sometimes, I wonder if it's ever gonna get any easier.
I hate that tree.
What?
I feel horrible saying it, but I hate it.
Every day I come down here and I look through this window,
and I hope,
and I pray that I will just see a tree,
instead of a reminder that I lost my baby.
I know I should've said this in therapy,
but I guess I was afraid.
But after speaking with Ana...
about her postpartum, I think, um...
I think that...
I've been depressed, too.
Ever since we lost Frankie.
And I'm not saying that it's...
that it's postpartum. I just...
I'm still not over it.
No, it's not gonna go away, love. That's not how grief works.
I know you know that.
It's awful, love, and it's...
messy and it sucks,
and it's gonna take as long as it takes, and you feel it,
and you ride it out, okay? And I'm gonna be here.
I'm gonna be here every second,
for whatever you need. You hear me?
One day, you're gonna look out that window,
and you're not gonna feel so sad, I promise.
So, I'm guessing that you've heard
about the whole "stolen car" misunderstanding.
So, please let me get Callie down here to explain.
Hey, Callie! Can you come down here, please?
Actually, that's not why I'm here.
I was reviewing Callie's file
for your final home study
to recommend her adoption to the judge,
and I have some concerns about Callie's foster brother.
Oh, well, A.J. will be moving to a new home
Yes.
in a few days.
It's not A.J. I'm worried about.
It's Brandon.
I'm wondering why you felt the need
to take out a restraining order against your son.
I don't even know how you got that. That was expunged.
Well, even if it was,
I'm afraid I can't make a recommendation on her adoption
until I investigate this further.
And while I am,
it's not appropriate for Callie to be in your care.
