this is such bull .
he &apos;s the one who ought to be arrested ,
not me .
i thought you girls were paid up front
before the lap dance .
this guy looked good for it .
so he &apos;s got his lap dance ...
yeah , two of them . good ones .
and then he paid you with postage stamps .
he said , &quot; it &apos;s the same as money . &quot;
really ? try paying rent with that .
that still doesn &apos;t mean you can
kick a man in his private parts , candy .
that &apos;s assault .
watch it ! you want to go ?
i got an emergency . i got an emergency .
listen . listen .
look , you gotta help me . somebody &apos;s trying to kill me .
yeah ? who &apos;s trying to kill you ?
i got this .
there . look at that .
right there .
look at it . see that ?
&quot; you have less than a day to live .
there is no way to prevent the inevitable . &quot;
i found that in my mailbox out of the blue .
i &apos;m not crazy .
how much have you had to drink tonight , sir ?
i can smell alcohol .
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s not important .
look , um ... i &apos;m sorry . just ...
can i stay here , uh , tonight ,
just until the morning ?
this isn &apos;t a motel .
just go back home , calm down , try to get some sleep .
mission accomplished , pal .
you &apos;re in for the night .
heard some whacked @-@ out helped empty the garbage last night .
you heard right .
word is this guy wanted to be arrested ?
yeah , now he &apos;s gotta go see the judge .
would &apos;ve been cheaper if he &apos;d just gone to a motel .
let &apos;s go . rise and shine .
damn it !
get an ambulance !
as my dear mother used to say , a penny for your thoughts .
jack asked me to speak to his class
about being an fbi agent .
they &apos;re having career day .
sounds like fun .
come on . every day you strap on the six @-@ shooter
and go after the bad guys .
the kids &apos;ll love it .
oh , i know . and i &apos;m glad he asked .
it just , i &apos;m a little worried about it
because i don &apos;t want it to end up being difficult for him .
because of what happened to hailey .
one of the bad guys killed his mom .
and he &apos;s doing fine . and we talk about it some ,
but i just don &apos;t want this to end up ... hurting him .
you &apos;re a good dad , aaron .
and i know you &apos;re doing everything you can to help him .
and i also know you &apos;ll make the right decision about this ,
whatever it is .
thanks .
oh , i &apos;m interrupting .
but we &apos;re ready .
thank you .
wayne campbell , 38 years old ,
found dying yesterday morning in his holding cell
in long beach , california .
he claimed someone was trying to kill him ,
so he purposely got himself arrested to be protected .
a strategy that didn &apos;t work out so great .
what is the c.o.d. ?
arsenic poisoning .
ah , an oldie but a goodie .
and you &apos;re tuned to the station where the hits keep coming .
when news spread of campbell &apos;s death ,
an officer in a nearby precinct
remembered helen mitchell .
6 days earlier , she showed up with this letter
she had found in her mailbox a few days before .
was it investigated ?
they started a file , but helen wasn &apos;t especially concerned .
and in light of campbell &apos;s death ,
they exhumed helen mitchell &apos;s body ,
and lethal amounts of arsenic were found in her system as well .
handwritten letters , poisoning by arsenic--
we could be looking at a female unsub .
who wants her victims to have foreknowledge of their deaths .
that &apos;s a new one .
actually , we &apos;ve seen a version of this m.o. before .
6 years ago in dallas , max pool warned his victims
by putting their faces on missing posters before killing them .
in any event , there may be notes out there
that we don &apos;t know about .
we &apos;ve got a long flight . let &apos;s get going .
you can exchange the muffler for equal or greater value .
come on . can &apos;t i exchange it for something cheaper ?
my car &apos;s got like 200,000 miles on it .
yeah , go ahead .
what &apos;s so important , man ?
i &apos;m on my way to pick up izzy for school .
wait . you think i did this ?
it was under my door when i came in to work this morning .
a death threat ?
i look like a psycho to you ?
this conversation &apos;s done .
hey , man , you ok ?
yeah . yeah .
look , maybe we had a fight the other day ,
but you and me , we go back a long time .
close up and go home , huh ?
take an aspirin .
quit accusing people of stuff .
hello ?
uh , anybody back here ?
i found the muffler i want .
fatal
a proverb states ,
&quot; he that is born to be hanged
shall never be drowned . &quot;
helen mitchell was the socially prominent widow
of an investment banker ,
philanthropist , patroness of the arts .
wayne campbell , on the other hand ,
was as blue collar as they come .
worked for a tree @-@ trimming and removal company .
garcia , was the m.e. able to estimate
when campbell might have ingested the arsenic .
somewhere between 6 : 00 and 10 p.m. last evening .
do we know where campbell was during those hours ?
same place he is every tuesday night
while his wife plays bridge .
erish grill . it &apos;s a neighborhood sports bar .
this isn &apos;t widely known ,
but helen mitchell had a drinking problem ,
and wayne campbell abused painkillers .
that could be the common thread ,
and unsub &apos;s punishing them for their vices ?
poisoning those who poison themselves ?
the syntax of the note is interesting .
instead of a simple &quot; stop it , &quot;
you get &quot; prevent the inevitable . &quot;
and in block lettering to disguise the handwriting .
oh , no . make room in your files ,
they &apos;re about to get thicker .
a third victim was just reported half an hour ago .
carlos ortega .
exact same note left on his body .
also poisoned ?
yeah , it looks that way .
well , this is weird .
there was a piece of twine on his chest .
no twine was reported on or near the first two victims .
less than a day between kills this time .
he &apos;s accelerating .
morgan , see who helen mitchell had contact with
in the 24 hours before she died .
dave , you and blake check out
the carlos ortega crime scene .
jj and reid to the sports bar ,
and i &apos;ll coordinate with local law enforcement .
are you the responding officer ?
yes , sir . delivery driver discovered the body .
blood , vomit , evidence of hyper @-@ salivation .
smelled garlic on the victim .
maybe somebody spiked his food ?
garlic odor in the breath and body tissue
is a common indicator of arsenic poisoning .
yeah , i wonder how the unsub
got him to ingest it .
is that the twine found on his chest ?
that &apos;s correct .
laid out real precise , in a straight line ,
pointing head to toe .
rossi .
detective tavez .
ssa hotchner .
glad you &apos;re here .
we have our share of homicides , but this is something new .
did you check with other precincts for similar cases ?
yes . nothing so far .
thank you very much .
hey , hotch .
helen mitchell &apos;s personal secretary .
she claims that helen was home alone the day of her death .
the only thing out of the ordinary
was a small box of chocolates delivered to the house .
do we know who sent them ?
supposedly a local charity
to thank her for hosting a fundraiser .
except the charity claims they know nothing about it .
any chocolates missing from the box ?
3 .
campbell &apos;s personal belongings you asked for .
thank you .
do you remember what mr. campbell ate the night before last ?
his usual . chili dog , onion rings .
cast @-@ iron stomach , that guy .
did he talk to anyone ?
just the guy sitting next to him .
was this other guy also a regular ?
no . i hadn &apos;t seen him before .
he kept buying wayne drinks , though .
can you describe him ?
white guy , heavy @-@ set , maybe 40 years old .
wore a hat , average @-@ looking .
do you think you &apos;d recognize him if you saw him again ?
yeah , i think so .
ok , well , thank you for your help .
we may be contacting you again .
anything i can do to help .
look , wayne seemed a little preoccupied that night ,
but he was a good guy .
the unsub may have spiked his drink .
it wouldn &apos;t have been hard to do .
a busy bar , lots of noise and distraction .
get another double vodka .
he kept plying campbell with booze to get him drunk .
yeah . i &apos;m gonna go to the head . i appreciate it .
and since what goes in has to eventually come out ,
it &apos;d be his way to ensure that he &apos;d get up at some point
to use the bathroom .
the victim left momentarily ...
the unsub slipped in the arsenic ...
and left the bar .
and when campbell returned from the bathroom ...
he took a drink .
he never had a clue .
oh ! holy cow !
all right , bill . last chance , buddy .
you sure you want to leave all this splendor
for some lousy island in the mediterranean ?
you know , bill almost jumped the gun and went 20 years ago .
had his ticket bought for greece and everything .
except ,
me and him went out and tied one on the night before ,
and bill missed the shuttle van to the airport .
and i could never look a mai tai in the face again .
hurry it up , wick . i don &apos;t like room temperature champagne .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
but here &apos;s to your new life , bill .
yeah ! congratulations , bill .
just remember to keep an extra hammock strung up on the beach
for your old buddy wick , huh ?
come on , speech . come on .
speech , speech , speech , speech , speech , speech ...
um , i ...
i was just thinking about how all of this was here before ...
and then how it &apos;s all gonna be here after .
you know , &apos; cause ...
when they &apos;re living like--
you know , i think--
i think bill &apos;s given up on english already
and is already talking greek .
come on up , guys , get some cake .
same kind of twine found in wayne campbell &apos;s pocket .
a friend of the victim &apos;s , benjie ruiz ,
came by the shop around 9 : 40
and saw a single customer
milling around in the muffler section .
there was no surveillance camera ,
but a cash register receipt confirms
somebody exchanged a muffler at 9 : 36 .
when mr. ruiz left 5 minutes later ,
the customer was still there .
9 : 50 , carlos was found dead .
no customer in sight .
do we have a description of him ?
white male in his 40s , large build , and he wore a hat .
that &apos;s the same description the bartender gave to me and jj .
it &apos;s gotta be our guy .
a green car was parked outside when benjie ruiz arrived
and was still there when he left .
no make or model , but pretty old .
according to mr. ruiz ,
carlos had no drug or alcohol issues .
he was a solid , hard @-@ working family man .
well , that puts a dent in our theory of an unsub
punishing people for their indiscretions .
unless carlos had a vice we don &apos;t know about .
we just confirmed that the chocolates and the water cooler
both tested positive for arsenic .
any twine found at helen mitchell &apos;s house ?
a couple feet of it were tossed in the kitchen trash .
we &apos;re thinking the chocolates may have been wrapped in it .
guys , i did a geographic profile of the victims ,
and it turns out they all lived or worked
in the same 2.65 square @-@ mile radius in the north part of the city .
well , that gives us his hunting ground ,
but not his victim selection criteria .
the bartender said the unsub may have
struck up a conversation with campbell there that night .
is it ballsy ?
the same way he walked into carlos &apos; store
to exchange the muffler .
and for some reason , he feels the need
to interact with his victims in the hours before they die .
911 . what &apos;s your emergency ?
it &apos;s not an emergency , really .
i just want to file a complaint against some kids in the neighborhood .
hold on , ma &apos;am . i &apos;m transferring you .
uh @-@ huh . these kids are how old ?
and can you tell me the nature of the note ?
can you read it to me ?
ma &apos;am , do not hang up .
i &apos;m getting someone from the fbi .
fbi ?
i don &apos;t need that . it &apos;s only some kids .
agent rossi , we have another person with a note .
a janice cheswick .
ma &apos;am , this is agent david rossi .
are you alone in your house ?
yes . i mean , i--
i think so .
double check that all your doors and windows are secured .
stay calm , and do not hang up your phone .
my god .
everything is locked . now what ?
all right . police have been dispatched to your home .
do not leave your house .
i &apos;m scared !
listen , janice .
this is very important that you do not eat or drink anything .
i won &apos;t .
ok . everything &apos;s gonna be ok .
help is on the way .
janice ?
janice ? !
help !
janice !
we &apos;ve got an apb out in the surrounding area
for an older green car .
do we know how he got in ?
garage door shows signs of forced entry .
probably spiked the wine .
and when she called the police instead ...
this time he used the twine to strangle her .
overkill .
the unsub was denied what he wanted most ,
the chance to engage with her before she died .
sharp knife , this level of frenzy .
hopefully this son of a bitch
also did some damage to himself .
i &apos;ll notify local e.r.s
to be on the lookout for hand lacerations .
you all right , dave ?
i told her she &apos;d be ok , aaron ,
that she &apos;d be fine .
let &apos;s go find this guy .
hey , kid . our geo profile just go turned upside down .
our latest victim lives and works a good 10 miles
from the unsub &apos;s hunting ground .
he &apos;s either branching out
or we &apos;re missing something .
hey , baby girl , i need you to work that magic of yours .
rub my lamp , release the genie .
our latest victim , janice cheswick--
track her activities as far back as it takes
to find a link between her and our other victims .
as far back as in days or weeks ?
months , if necessary .
pushing it , aladdin , but i &apos;m a go .
that &apos;s why i love you .
these pieces of twine are all different lengths .
are you just now figuring that out ?
i think it &apos;s by design .
starting with the first victim ,
the lengths are 25 , 15 , 12,
and 19 inches .
yeah , so what ?
if you convert inches to centimeters ,
you &apos;ll have 64 , 38 , 31 , and 48,
the exact ages of all 4 victims .
i think i know what this is about .
the man we &apos;re looking for is a highly organized defender ,
but we don &apos;t yet know why or how he &apos;s choosing his victims .
these appear to be killings of opportunity ,
yet he &apos;s researched his targets
as though they &apos;d been selected carefully and with premeditation .
they run the gamut .
young and old , rich and poor , male and female .
but with all of them , he leaves behind a piece of twine .
why does he do that ?
what does the twine represent ?
in greek mythology , a person &apos;s destiny
was in the hands of the three fates .
one to spin the thread of life ,
another to measure the thread ,
and finally atropos ,
the one who cut the thread with shears at the moment of death .
we think that &apos;s what the twine symbolizes .
he &apos;s decided the fate of his victims and then he observes them .
as if assuming the form of a mythological god himself .
we don &apos;t know what triggered the spree ,
but the unsub may have
recently suffered a loss and is now lashing out .
if he can &apos;t control his own fate ,
he will control others .
this unsub is also quite meticulous .
he studies his victims in advance to the murders ,
follows them , learns their habits , even interacts with them .
his need to engage directly with his victims
is a compulsion that overrides the risk of being caught .
this compulsion will likely be his downfall
and lead to his eventual capture .
the time period between warning his victims and killing them
is getting shorter with each murder .
he could be unraveling .
the public needs to be made aware
that if they receive a note similar to the ones
he &apos;s already sent , they need to contact 911 immediately .
thank you .
so sorry , my beautiful creatures ,
my dmv search yielded nuttin &apos; ,
but i did make progress on another front .
that janice cheswick , she lives
clear across on the other side of town , right ?
well , last week , at 4 : 17 in the afternoon
on the 23rd , to be precise ,
she charged a double soy latte at a coffee shop
smack dab in the middle of the geo zone of the other 3 victims .
sending this now .
it &apos;s next to the university .
the unsub may be a part of academia .
all right , garcia ,
start with the schools of classics and humanities
and work out from there .
check any students or faculty for red flags .
a fighting bull like moi looks for nothing else .
i &apos;ve got a sudden craving for a double soy latte .
let &apos;s take a ride .
do you recognize any of these people ?
i don &apos;t . sorry .
what &apos;s this about ?
we &apos;re investigating a series of murders ,
and we think the killer
may have seen one or more of these victims at this coffee shop .
victims ? you mean ...
all these people got killed ?
excuse me . is that a pinhole camera ?
you secretly videotape your employees ?
not the employees , just the cash register area .
yeah , well , i guess that means the employees .
we &apos;ve got a pilferage problem .
how long has this surveillance been going on ?
uh ... 5 weeks .
go to 4 : 17 p.m. on the 23rd .
that &apos;s her .
that &apos;s all of them .
the unsub must be just out of camera range .
this is the moment he selected all his victims .
it ties in with his idea of fate , that these 4
were in the wrong place at the wrong time .
let &apos;s bring in benjie ruiz and the bartender
and see if they recognize
anyone who came in that day as the man they saw .
there &apos;s another identification we need to make , and fast .
the next in line .
who is it ?
it &apos;s me , wick .
uh , ok , just a minute .
you forgot to turn in your keys .
thought i &apos;d swing by and get &apos; em ,
before you were on the other side of the world .
i haven &apos;t been here in a while .
yeah .
i love what you &apos;ve done with the place , though .
thanks , man .
oh , wow , what did you do to your hand ?
oh , i cut it . clumsy .
so what &apos;s the deal with you and greece , anyway ?
i don &apos;t know . just always made sense to me .
really ?
this makes sense to you ?
yeah .
here .
thanks .
well , man ...
safe travels .
i should &apos;ve gone .
20 years ago ,
i should have gone .
you were broke 20 years ago , bill .
hell , i did you a favor that night .
a favor ?
i ... got you wasted on purpose .
come on .
you had to have figured that out by now .
like you were about to leave a primo job
to go halfway across the world ,
with no money , no prospects .
then your mom got sick right after that , right ?
well , if you &apos;d have gone , you wouldn &apos;t have been here
to look after her the way you did .
and now you &apos;re set , man .
you got-- you got your healthcare , you got your pension .
you worked hard for that .
you can go do greece in style now . you &apos;ve earned it .
how long have they been at it ?
2 hours , 11.1 / 2 minutes .
garcia &apos;s still combing through university records .
no luck .
the fifth customer paid in cash ,
so we can &apos;t track her .
but an enhanced vidcap of her is being distributed
to everyone that worked at the coffee shop the last 6 months .
hopefully someone knows who she is .
at the coffee shop , a couple of guys came in wearing scrubs .
is there a hospital near campus ?
yeah , there &apos;s a medical center affiliated with the university .
what if that &apos;s why the killer was in the vicinity ?
for the hospital , not the university .
we profiled the unsub may have experienced a loss .
what if someone he was close to died
or was diagnosed with a serious illness ?
except this doesn &apos;t feel like a guy who has close friends
or a tight @-@ knit family .
what if it &apos;s him ?
the unsub himself got some bad news .
if they told him he had a terminal illness ,
it would explain the m.o.
you get thrown a curveball ...
you throw a curveball back .
do unto others what was done unto you .
let &apos;s get garcia on it .
let &apos;s go , guys .
they couldn &apos;t identify any of the other customers
as the man they saw at the auto shop or sports bar .
the killer is picking his victims in the moment , right ?
you , you , you , and you .
no advance planning .
that &apos;s how it looks .
yet he later stalks each one ,
learning their habits .
how does he manage to do that
if they all scatter after they get their coffee ?
parking lot .
he saw them through the window .
waited till they came out one by one and drove away .
took down their license plate numbers .
a little research at the dmv .
none of the coffee shop
employees can identify the fifth woman in line .
detective , can you make the surveillance video go any faster ?
it &apos;ll go any speed you want .
go back to the beginning .
i need to watch all 5 weeks in the video .
but that &apos;s--
525 hours .
yeah . we don &apos;t have time for that .
reid , tell him what you did this morning for breakfast .
i read &quot; war and peace . &quot;
reread it , actually .
this time in the original russian .
trust me , detective , there &apos;s enough time .
the university was a wash ,
but the med center may just pay off .
in the last 3 months , 485 patients
were diagnosed with terminal illness .
34 of those were white males in their 40s .
8 of those have green cars over 15 years old .
like i said , i &apos;m close .
if there was only a way to research who wears hats .
did any of the 8 have reason to be at the hospital on april 23rd ?
23rd ...
bingo ! william harding had an appointment with his oncologist ,
got the bad news .
an address , garcia .
sending it now .
thank you .
fbi !
hotch .
how do you do that ?
by employing the same principles used in speed reading .
i minimize subvocalization of the images
and reduce cognitive load by--
wait , wait .
back up the feed .
there .
that &apos;s her .
can you push in on her name tag ?
yeah .
hey . it &apos;s 12.50 .
hold on . let me get my wallet .
there you go .
thank you very much .
bonnie taylor isn &apos;t answering .
is this her home address ?
yeah , but today &apos;s her day off , so she &apos;s not at work .
detective , send squad cars to this address immediately .
right away .
so much for my diet .
and you &apos;re sure you &apos;ve never seen this man ?
uh ... i &apos;m positive .
this was in the mailbox outside .
oh , my god .
when was the last time you checked your mailbox ?
uh , yesterday , i think .
wait , no , um , the day before .
i--i ...
i skip sometimes .
excuse us .
ok .
they haven &apos;t found any arsenic yet .
we must have gotten here first .
no , he had plenty of time .
i don &apos;t think bonnie &apos;s his target anymore .
the shift in the m.o. is too dramatic .
the time between leaving the note
and the murders was contracting ,
not expanding , and he made no effort to interact with her .
he could be devolving .
it &apos;s not a loss of focus , it &apos;s a shift in focus .
between the time that harding left the note and now ,
a more important target &apos;s presented itself .
you must be a glutton for punishment .
one day retired and you &apos;re back for more .
i thought we could have a drink .
a drink .
ah , i &apos;m liking this new bill harding already .
what &apos;s the occasion ?
i didn &apos;t realize until today
how you &apos;d gone out of your way for me 20 years ago .
i thought i &apos;d return the favor .
skol .
garcia , does bill harding have any family in the area ?
parents deceased , no siblings .
what about his job ?
uh , worked the cargo bays in a shipyard .
yesterday was his last day , actually .
what type of cancer does he have ?
mesothelioma .
asbestos .
he got it working at the shipyard .
his anger might be directed toward someone there .
send morgan the work address .
yes , sir .
look at you , huh ?
going off to live your dream .
and here i am .
i got the wife , kids , a two @-@ damn @-@ car garage .
probably be working on these docks for the rest of my life .
cheers .
oh , god , you know , if we ever run out of paint thinner around here ,
i know what to buy .
does he have any criminal history or mental health issues ?
well , he &apos;s been on antidepressants most of his life .
but he &apos;s got a clean police record .
oh , my .
what is it ?
he was part of a massive police search and rescue
when he was 6 years old .
when i was 6 , before my folks moved here from idaho ,
my best friend randy and i got lost up in the mountains .
we were on a camping trip with ...
our parents .
it started snowing and got cold ,
so we decided to separate
to try to find our way back and get help .
randy never made it . i did .
when they found randy , he was frozen .
i was in the hospital for a week .
damn , bill .
why didn &apos;t you tell me this before ?
people said it was my fault .
we shouldn &apos;t have split up .
they think that &apos;s why randy died .
come on .
when i was in the hospital ,
my first @-@ grade teacher came to visit me .
and she gave me this book .
a kids book on greek mythology .
i opened it ...
and there it was .
there what was ?
a picture of the labyrinth .
it looked just like that forest
that randy and i got lost in .
but i escaped .
just like theseus .
like theseus .
you know , you &apos;re starting to talk a little crazy .
you know that , don &apos;t you ?
oh , it &apos;s not crazy .
it &apos;s fate .
i got out ...
and he did not .
read this .
what , is this a joke ?
sorry .
not funny , bill . no .
i did more digging , hotch ,
and i can tell you
where he &apos;s gonna be a week from now --
flight 906 , seat 23a ,
lax to athens , greece .
get this .
bill harding also applied for an extended visa to greece
way back in 1994 .
did he go ?
negative . he reserved a spot with higgins airport shuttle ,
didn &apos;t show up , plane left without him ...
oh , man , you are not gonna believe this .
i &apos;m dying .
cancer .
the doctor says i have 3 to 6 months to live ,
but it doesn &apos;t matter , because most of me died
when i missed that plane .
when i left the doctor &apos;s office ,
i stopped at a coffee shop ...
i couldn &apos;t get out .
because there were just all of these people
all around , so happy ,
making plans .
they were so damn sure
that nothing bad was ever gonna happen to them .
it &apos;s fate .
some are chosen and some are not .
what are you gonna do , bill ?
are you gonna kill me with that thing ?
no , not this .
poison .
fbi , don &apos;t move .
william harding ,
you &apos;re under arrest for the murders of helen mitchell ,
wayne campbell , carlos ortega ,
and janice cheswick .
drop the weapon -- now .
i think he poisoned me .
we &apos;ll get you to a hospital .
but right now you need to drop the weapon .
no . he took 20 years of my life from me .
you got that backwards .
that shuttle bus ,
it crashed on the way to the airport .
all 5 people were killed .
you not getting in that van kept you alive .
now put it down .
&quot; a person often meets his destiny
on the road he took to avoid it . &quot;
jean de la fontaine .
thanks .
given any more thought to , um , career day ?
jack &apos;s third @-@ grade class
is descending on the bau on monday .
excellent .
and is jack happy about it ?
ecstatic .
he &apos;s very excited .
he &apos;s proud of you .
i know .
and i don &apos;t want to take that away from him .
the challenging part is coming up with a profiling presentation .
well , after 20 years of facing down killers ,
rapists , and psychopaths ,
ssa aaron hotchner
may have finally met his match .
i &apos;ve observed each of you .
i &apos;ve interrogated you .
and none of you claims to have the stapler .
at first i thought it was you .
but then ...
i profiled ...
that it &apos;s really you .
what exactly did you profile ?
well , a few things .
first , jesse , you wouldn &apos;t look at me in the eye .
but you were very fidgety with your hands .
and then when ms. garcia dropped her lucky quarter ,
all 3 of you noticed , but you didn &apos;t react at all .
you were too busy keeping a lie straight in your head .
well , this has been a very interesting demonstration ,
mr. hotchner .
thank you , ms. springer .
class , let &apos;s all give him a big thank @-@ you .
thank you !
you &apos;re welcome .
sir , may i show them my office ?
absolutely . everybody go with ms. garcia .
come on , you guys .
it &apos;s like the batcave ,
and you can each hold a pen .
can i be a profiler when i grow up ?
sure , honey .
if you get good grades and you work hard
and you think you might be good at it ,
why not ?
i &apos;m good at it .
are you ?
i did a profile on ms. springer .
me ?
yeah . you like jack &apos;s dad . - i &apos;m not sure --
when you talk about your cat ,
you talk real , real fast ,
because you really like your cat .
you talked real fast like that today ,
not like with the other dads .
thanks again , mr. hotchner .
thank you for the great time .
you &apos;re welcome .
probably had to go feed the cat .
so how did i do ?
it was cool .
it was cool . so what do you say we celebrate ?
yeah .
hot dogs or hamburgers ?
both .
