my favorite part .
you don &apos;t know the lyrics , do you ?
i don &apos;t even know the lyrics , louis .
now are we practicing law down here ,
or auditioning a chorus line ?
it &apos;s called esprit de corps .
and i just got a $ 100 million jury award overturned .
i don &apos;t have to overturn awards like that
because i &apos;ve never lost one in the first place .
so what is this , a new cologne
or just a hint of jealousy ?
i &apos;m surprised you , uh ,
don &apos;t recognize your wife &apos;s perfume .
i know , you &apos;re not married .
it &apos;s still funny .
you do realize we &apos;re celebrating
making fat people even fatter , right ?
if you wanted to do good ,
you should &apos;ve been a fake doctor .
business cards .
yup .
my mistake is now official . come with me .
and learn the goddamn lyrics to the harvard song , will ya ?
oakhurst capital has agreed
to a $ 200 million licensing deal .
we are at the goal line .
how are we on brand protection ?
the contract is airtight .
the only issue here
is to get the joyful toy company to close .
i &apos;ll go over it with joy one @-@ on @-@ one .
protocol in a meeting is to put your phone on silent .
and if it does ring ,
you answer it .
not in here .
don &apos;t feel the need to rush back when you &apos;re done .
who is this ?
dude , it &apos;s trevor . don &apos;t hang up .
i only get one call .
i &apos;m in jail .
i--i tried to hop this bus at port authority .
i was drunk . it &apos;s all messed up .
look , i know we haven &apos;t talked since we fought ,
but i didn &apos;t know who else to call .
i &apos;m sorry , man . i &apos;m sorry .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna pay you back .
good .
your bail cost me everything i have in the bank .
the thing is ,
i don &apos;t have the money .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re clearing $ 10,000 a month selling weed .
it went out as fast as it came in .
came in ?
i quit . i &apos;m not dealing anymore .
bullshit .
i &apos;m serious .
after we fought , i don &apos;t know .
things just started to fall apart .
jenny broke up with me .
i didn &apos;t know .
well , i just realized i needed to make a change .
even sold my bong .
what have you done with my friend ?
yeah . you should talk .
look at you . you look like gordon gekko &apos;s little brother .
okay .
what , are you working on wall street , man ?
why &apos;d you call me , trevor ?
you &apos;re the one person i knew would show up .
you want to ask me for anything .. else ?
look , all i care about right now
is keeping my record clean .
you don &apos;t happen to know any good lawyers , do ya ?
no . i don &apos;t .
why the rush now ?
you &apos;ve already wasted ten minutes of my life .
please tell me you didn &apos;t wait ten minutes
just to scold me .
i &apos;ve been waiting for you to bring the paperwork down
so i can close a nine @-@ figure licensing deal .
if your phone rings while i &apos;m talking to ray ,
i &apos;m throwing it out of the car while it &apos;s attached to your hand .
eddie hope and the mannish boys .
1959 , three guesse .
guesses ?
you insult me , harvey .
don &apos;t worry , we won &apos;t be late .
okay ,
what was the name of the record label ?
marlin records .
who covered it in the late &apos; 60s ?
ahh ! i want to say the stones , but--
you need some guesses ?
just like a private car service , huh ?
thinking you don &apos;t have to yield ?
what ? yield ? you ran a red light !
that light was yellow !
no , sir , it was not !
are you calling me a liar ?
back off .
mind your business , okay ?
no , i &apos;m minding my business .
anyone throws a punch ,
or i &apos;m gonna introduce you to mr. taser .
trade insurance ,
i &apos;ll take reports , one at a time .
yeah , as much as i &apos;d like to help you out ,
i &apos;m late for a meeting .
you &apos;re not going anywhere . i need a statement from you too .
here &apos;s my information .
i need you to babysit the client till i get there .
and don &apos;t mention the deal .
if she asks any questions ,
just nod your head
and look pretty .
ms. mcafee , i &apos;m mike ross .
i work with harvey .
oh , you &apos;re the protege that he &apos;s been gushing about .
he was gushing ?
well , he mentioned that you existed .
for harvey , that &apos;s gushing .
uh , he &apos;s running a few minutes late today .
um , car trouble .
i was just about to have tea with the girls .
would you care to join me ?
i &apos;d love to .
good .
and for heaven &apos;s sakes , call me joy .
okay , joy .
these ...
are the girls .
susie , sarah ,
stacy , sinclair ,
and sabrina .
susie , where are your manners ?
shake hands with this nice young man .
just kidding , i know they &apos;re dolls .
they &apos;re named after my daughters .
i started the company because of them , really .
you know , dolls didn &apos;t used to be
these cheap , plastic bimbos from china that we have today .
your mother made them for you by hand .
i wanted my girls to have that same experience .
and here we are , 30 years later .
every parent &apos;s worst nightmare .
what do you mean ?
these little angels , they sell for $ 90 a pop .
i wasn &apos;t born with a butler , you know .
i gotta say , this is amazing ,
taking on a project like a licensing deal .
why is that amazing ?
well , my grandmother could never pull this off .
she &apos;s been retired for ten years .
how is that treating her ?
she lives near my apartment .
i get to see her once a week , so ...
that &apos;s very sweet of you .
no .
no , it &apos;s not .
you know , whenever i needed her ,
she was there .
you know , no matter what .
she &apos;d give me a hug ,
she &apos;d tell me everything is gonna be all right .
even if it wasn &apos;t .
and now that she needs me ,
i am always at work .
and i &apos;m--
i &apos;m so sorry .
yeah ?
never answer your phone in front of a client .
but it &apos;s you .
what &apos;s happening ?
well , actually we &apos;re in the middle of a tea party .
i knew you were the doll @-@ playing type .
put joy on .
ms. mcafee .
it &apos;s harvey .
joy , i &apos;m sorry ,
i have to reschedule .
no need to apologize .
i like this one .
i &apos;ll send him back after tea .
tell me you didn &apos;t ask our client for a doggy bag .
what can i say ? stacy insisted .
just got off with joy mcafee &apos;s general counsel .
it seems she had an epiphany .
she wants less on her plate , not more .
i thought you were going to close her .
we need that doll money .
i &apos;m on top of it .
harvey took five months to structure that deal .
please don &apos;t make me set fire to your desk .
all you had to do was have tea with the dolls .
donna , schedule another tea party with joy
as soon as possible .
and text me the names of her girls .
oh , what a shock .
you can &apos;t keep girls &apos; names straight in your head .
just yours , debbie .
see , that &apos;s funny because your name is donna .
harvey specter .
i got your order right here .
i didn &apos;t order a pizza .
you &apos;ve been served .
cab driver who hit ray
named me as a witness in a civil suit .
i need to pay travis bickle a visit .
harvey , if you let me go talk to joy ,
i know i can fix this--
no .
you don &apos;t send a puppy to clean up its own mess .
optimally , you don &apos;t even have a puppy .
ross , rumor has it you talked a client
out of $ 200 million .
the deal &apos;s not off the table , all right ?
it &apos;s just a speed bump .
dude , i think we just found him a new nickname .
speed bump !
i feel like i &apos;m back in high school .
they called you speed bump in high school ?
kidding .
but if you need any boxes to pack up your office , just--
wait a minute , uh--
there .
i think that belongs to you .
it wouldn &apos;t hurt so much if you had thicker skin .
what do you want ?
i wanna pay you back for posting bail .
trevor , you &apos;ve owed me 40 bucks since fifth grade .
i wrote it off , okay ?
look , i want a clean slate , okay ?
so you don &apos;t want to see me , i &apos;ll mail you a check .
okay .
yeah , let &apos;s hang out tomorrow night .
nothing crazy , though , all right ?
i have to be up early .
we can crochet panty hose
if that &apos;s what it takes to be cool .
i think we can do a little better than that .
why don &apos;t we , uh ...
why don &apos;t we say rex &apos;s , 7 : 30 .
first six rounds are on me .
if you &apos;re serious about paying me back ,
the first 100 rounds are on you .
so it &apos;s the tough guy .
this is a matter for insurance ,
not a frivolous lawsuit .
you know , for your information ,
i suffered emotional pain .
emotional pain ?
rub this on your emotional pain .
you condescending son of a--
look at me , i am gonna warn you once .
do not pursue this matter .
you know , i have been held up at gunpoint three times .
so do you think a fancy suit
and a $ 500 haircut , that &apos;s gonna scare me ?
you take my driver to court ,
i &apos;m gonna represent him myself .
and when you lose ,
you &apos;ll be covering my fee ,
which is gonna be a hell of a lot of haircuts .
hmm , so you weren &apos;t a one @-@ way fare .
ray &apos;s worked for me eight years .
then you don &apos;t have to worry about being a witness ,
because as his employer ,
you &apos;re liable for his actions .
you know , i think you &apos;ve seen way too many reruns of ally mcbeal .
you know , i emigrated here after september 11th ,
and they shut the doors on everybody .
i couldn &apos;t pay for a lawyer , so i had to take them to court .
i sued for my citizenship ,
so i have a very special appreciation for the law .
i appreciate a good single malt .
i don &apos;t pretend i can make one .
i wiped the floor with the u.s. government , counselor .
i &apos;m gonna do the same with you .
ray .
donna .
what are you doin &apos; here ? i don &apos;t have you scheduled .
uh , i need to see harvey .
oh , come on . you know the rules .
no one sets foot in there without a warrant ,
a papal edict , or my say @-@ so .
i just got named in a multimillion @-@ dollar lawsuit .
the accident wasn &apos;t my fault .
can i get in to see harvey , please ?
okay , say no more . i will get you in .
you are so beautiful when you &apos;re forceful .
i know you meant that as a compliment ,
but i don &apos;t appreciate limitations being placed
on my beauty .
harvey , i &apos;m already losing money with my car in the shop .
a trial means i can &apos;t work .
and how do you think my name
is gonna play in front of a new york jury ?
rahim benghazi .
i may as well buy a one @-@ way ticket to guantanamo .
not gonna happen .
if i lose ,
i won &apos;t even be able to afford a livery license ,
let alone my insurance .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna be defending both of us .
ray , this goes against every fiber of my being .
i &apos;m taking your case pro bono .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
absolutely nothing , i &apos;ve got a reputation to maintain .
besides , it &apos;s not gonna take long , okay ?
i &apos;m gonna get it dismissed .
donna , call the court .
we need priority status on the docket .
yeah , i already tried .
you drew judge palermo .
you know what you have to do , don &apos;t you ?
yeah . the other thing that goes against every fiber of my being .
louis , has anyone told you you &apos;re an exquisite soprano ?
what do you want , harvey ?
you &apos;re right . why prolong my suffering ?
i need you to get me in to see judge palermo .
you need my help , and you &apos;re not gonna pull rank on me ?
your case has nothing to do with firm business , does it ?
what &apos;s it gonna take ?
a mani @-@ pedi ? tickets to celine ?
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
and your pound of flesh ?
i need my back scratched , i &apos;ll let you know .
louis , unless that &apos;s a metaphor , the deal &apos;s off .
joy , when i told you that my grandmother didn &apos;t have much time ,
i--i didn &apos;t realize that she &apos;s 15 years older than you .
now , how would you know how old i am ?
that is a very closely guarded secret .
i did some research .
very resourceful .
i did it to assure myself
that you can handle a heavier workload .
i appreciate that , but i &apos;m not worried about my health .
is it the money ?
because i can guarantee , 200 million up front
is just 1 / 10 of what you stand to make on this deal .
michael ,
my dolls eat better than most people .
i &apos;ve got plenty of money .
this deal meant staying on for five more years
and doubling my workload .
i am going to take my grandchildren on a cruise
to tahiti .
tahiti ?
you know , the licensing agreement
includes a theme park .
you could-- you could take them there .
it &apos;s not about the deal .
i have had this same view for 25 years .
i need a change of scenery .
i am gonna speak to harvey , and i &apos;m gonna tell him
that i want to sell the whole business .
so ...
i just spoke to judge palermo .
and because he thinks i &apos;m a good guy ,
and i told him i &apos;d owe him one ,
your case is gonna be moved up way ahead .
back scratch .
i don &apos;t have a firstborn , you know ,
so what exactly do you want for that ?
no , you &apos;re not getting one of my ties .
no .
your shoulder ? what--
your lapel--
donna ?
oh , god .
norma is going to istanbul for two weeks ,
and you know that i &apos;m not good with temps .
oh , my god . ask me for something else .
harvey , this is non @-@ negotiable .
you owe me now .
donna is one thing that i can &apos;t give you .
why not ?
for one thing ,
she &apos;d never agree to it .
you &apos;re her boss .
you just tell her to do stuff .
i don &apos;t tell her to do anything .
she just does .
all right , fine . you know what ?
that &apos;s just ... not a problem .
i will call judge palermo ,
and i &apos;ll tell him i was mistaken ,
and then your hearing will be in ,
i don &apos;t know , maybe six months ?
i tell you what .
if you can convince her yourself ,
you have my blessing .
she &apos;s gonna love me so much ,
you &apos;re gonna fight to get her back .
hi , donna .
harvey and i were just , uh , talking about you .
no .
you don &apos;t even know what i was gonna say .
yes , i do .
and how is that possible ?
i read lips , i know body language ,
and i talk to norma .
i &apos;m not some token you win at a fair , louis .
you &apos;re not--i know you &apos;re not . you &apos;re not a token .
i &apos;m a human being , and i--
yes , you are .
i &apos;m sorry , i just--
you know what , that just made me feel really ...
cheap .
i &apos;m just trying to tell you that
you &apos;re really good at what you do , donna .
so i &apos;m gonna ask you--
it &apos;s like my soul hurts now .
no , donna , listen ,
even if your soul hurts a little bit--
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s gonna be fine . don &apos;t cry .
please don &apos;t cry , donna .
oh , shit .
i think i owe you one for that . that was fun .
wait a second , the-- the time that you cried ,
and then i let your parents stay in my condo--
yup .
so you don &apos;t want to talk about it ?
what is there to talk about ?
i did exactly what my boss told me not to do ,
and it blew up in my face .
dude , i told you , i &apos;m taking care of this .
in my last few hours of employment , please , i should pay .
all right , put the wallet away .
this is epic .
this is the scam we always talked about .
god , i bet you &apos;re gettin &apos; laid left and right .
oh , yeah . yeah , yeah , yeah .
you lose appreciation after a while .
come on .
yeah .
why &apos;d you put a phone number on there ?
it &apos;s a real firm .
oh , yeah ?
what are you doing ?
oh , i &apos;m just calling the employee directory .
it &apos;s part of the scam , man .
they &apos;ll check your story .
stop it .
what ?
trevor , stop .
hang up the phone .
oh , no .
trevor , hang up the phone , stop !
what ?
all right ? i &apos;m working there .
oh , yeah . what , as a lawyer ?
are you--
dude .
it &apos;s a long story , okay ?
but you can &apos;t tell anyone . ever . okay ?
that is awesome !
man , i-- i always said
that if you quit smoking pot ,
you could do it .
yeah .
yeah , oh , that &apos;s right . yeah , you did .
right before you passed me the bowl .
what ?
naw , i just--
i wish you trusted me enough to tell me .
i mean , all i did was set you up on a drug bust .
oh , god , that was too soon .
i &apos;m sorry .
hi , ladies . how are you ?
um , i want to let you know , if you--either of you
ever get arrested for anything ,
you call this guy . he &apos;s the best attorney in the city .
well , what would we get arrested for ?
um ... i don &apos;t know .
what are you thinking about doing ?
i-- as your attorney , i would definitely advise you to do that .
uh , four more .
yeah .
i must warn you that representing yourself at trial is not the--
what &apos;s he doing here ?
you think you can schedule a meeting without me knowing it ?
oh , no .
i &apos;m privy to all communication between you and the court .
well , if your driving matched your legal knowledge ,
we wouldn &apos;t be here .
your honor .
this case should be dismissed . it &apos;s a matter for insurance .
insurance only covers repairs .
it does not deal with my losses .
what losses ?
because of the accident ,
i missed my chance to get my taxi medallion .
you can &apos;t just buy it next year ?
the loan i got expires in one week .
on top of that , a medallion costs 300,000 this go @-@ round .
next year , 350 .
so his entire claim rests upon
the assumption that he would &apos;ve won this year &apos;s medallion .
the hallmark of america
is that the little guy gets to see justice done .
we are all equals in the eyes of the law .
that is why , out of all the countries in the world ,
i chose to come here .
what do you got to say about that , counselor ?
i say atticus finch makes a good speech here .
but this is a fender @-@ bender ,
not a multimillion @-@ dollar lawsuit .
vicarious liability applies to
discrimination , harassment , and accidents .
employers are responsible for their employees &apos; negligence .
court finds a reasonable suit here .
trial starts tomorrow .
thank you , your honor .
you &apos;re getting a good kick out of this , aren &apos;t you ?
i am .
but i &apos;m taking this on its merits .
and you better bring your &quot; a &quot; game tomorrow ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s got a legitimate claim .
he wants a trial ?
i &apos;ll give him a goddamn trial .
your honor .
so how many cases have you won ?
i only remember how many i &apos;ve lost .
none .
wait , what happened to the drinks ?
i got a better idea .
let &apos;s say we get a bottle
and take the party back to your place ?
make it a bottle of dom , and you &apos;re on .
all right , how about four bottles ?
come on .
you guys want to get a cab ?
definitely .
definitely . cab , four bottles of dom .
you want to spend any more of my money ?
just relax , okay ?
it &apos;s an investment in the evening .
and , uh , i just said the thing about the bottles
to get the girls out of the bar .
really ? &apos; cause it looked like
you were trying to get away from those guys .
taxi !
what guys ?
the guys in the back .
you know what i &apos;m talking about . come on , who are they ?
what ? those two ? i--i--i don &apos;t know .
where are all the ... cabs ?
well , it looked like they knew you ,
and not in a very good way .
i--i don &apos;t know . maybe they were , uh ,
flirting with our dates , okay ?
i &apos;d be pissed too if i watched those legs
walk away from me .
how are we doin &apos; , ladies ?
my feet are killing me in these heels .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , trevor , come on--
taxi !
seriously , stop playing with me . what was that about back there ?
look , i &apos;m not playing with you , all right ?
but just play your cards right ,
maybe you and , uh , maybe marcella will , uh ,
maybe she &apos;ll play with you .
okay .
now , it &apos;s gonna be a tight squeeze .
who wants to sit on my lap ?
want to go after him ?
no , we &apos;re gonna get to him through this guy .
ah @-@ ha ! just like the good old days , huh ?
are you kidding me ?
this is way better than the good old days .
i--i &apos;m actually missing a shoe .
hey , where are we ?
uh , i think we &apos;re in hoboken .
you wanted to see me ?
did you go see joy after i told you not to ?
how did you know ?
i didn &apos;t . until now .
i told you ,
a puppy can &apos;t clean up its own mess .
mess ? all i did was tell her about my grandmother .
your job is to make my life easier .
if you can &apos;t understand that , why did i hire you ?
police report summarized .
traffic signal analysis .
medallion bids , attendees , and results .
that &apos;s why you hired me .
i thought you were all over the joy situation .
instead , you &apos;re all over page six .
you wanted me to do pro bono work , this is it .
pro bono enhances a firm &apos;s image .
this makes us look like wealthy bullies
against an everyman cabbie .
does that seem like it enhances our image to you ?
i refuse to answer that ,
on the grounds that i don &apos;t want to .
someone had a fun night .
answer another call you shouldn &apos;t have ?
i--i-- i didn &apos;t--i was--
piece of advice-- when the big dog asks the puppy
something like that , it &apos;s a rhetorical question .
got it .
before you go ,
the phone call , the other day ,
when you answered it during the meeting ...
yeah . sorry about that . won &apos;t happen again .
who was it ?
um , it &apos;s just a friend . you know , an emergency .
what kind of emergency ?
was it a friend who almost got you
busted for drug trafficking ?
that friend ? trevor ?
he &apos;s not dealing anymore , harvey .
so it was him .
he called you from jail ?
you know , i make a living
learning how to read people , mike .
so if i saw it , jessica did too .
is that the kind of impression you want to leave around here ?
this guy is not your friend .
he is an anchor dragging you down . get rid of him .
he is my oldest friend , harvey .
i wasn &apos;t just gonna let him rot in jail .
what &apos;s gonna happen the next time ?
&apos;cause there will be a next time .
you gonna bail him out ?
put yourself in jeopardy ?
you know , if it weren &apos;t for trevor ,
you and i never would &apos;ve met .
cut him loose .
we &apos;re here to see mike ross .
he &apos;s an associate .
his friend trevor referred us .
thank you .
it looked like they knew you , and not in a very good way .
excuse me , officer .
is-- is central park that way ?
yeah , just go right there .
uh , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m--i &apos;m--
i &apos;m really terrible with direction .
is it this street , right here ?
yeah , this street , yes .
this street .
right here ?
yeah .
okay .
trevor , it &apos;s mike . call me back .
i need to know what the hell &apos;s going on .
did you get the red velvet cupcakes ?
yes , three dozen , extra icing .
how the hell did that happen ?
okay . you know what ?
there . problem solved .
i asked you , how &apos;d you get that tear ?
a couple of guys came to the firm .
they were looking for me .
i don &apos;t know what they wanted , but i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m pretty sure it something to do with some shit trevor did .
and that big brain of yours
doesn &apos;t remember me saying to cut ties with that loser ?
you know what ?
you &apos;ve been blowing off joy &apos;s deal
all week for your friend , okay ? so please .
first of all , trevor &apos;s not your friend .
you want to know why i &apos;m loyal to ray ?
i was taking a limo , and i left $ 3,000 in it .
ray happened to be the driver .
he found it and tracked me down .
not a nickel of it was missing ,
and his first reaction when this accident occurred
was to ask if we were okay .
now , what would trevor &apos;s have been ?
cut him off .
now , as far as the licensing deal goes ,
just because you think i &apos;m blowing something off
doesn &apos;t mean i am .
now , watch and learn .
everything &apos;s set for you to walk away .
we &apos;re selling your stake as a block .
your , uh , headhunter &apos;s lining up your replacement as we speak .
well , harvey ,
this was the most wonderful surprise .
you &apos;re a long @-@ time client who wants to be with her family .
it &apos;s the least i could do .
and you &apos;ll have all the free time in the world
to spend with them .
joey broke the microwave .
oh , that &apos;s great .
now , how soon can we send &apos; em home ?
they &apos;re booked on the first flight out , tomorrow morning .
so when you had donna text you the girls &apos; names--
i was talking about her daughters .
and you were gonna fly them out all along .
do you remember when i said ,
&quot; you don &apos;t send a puppy to clean up its own mess ? &quot;
yes , harvey , i do .
i &apos;m not a puppy .
court will come to order .
mr. santana , your opening statement , please .
driving a cab is not very glamorous .
but it &apos;s an honest day &apos;s work .
ever since i started ,
i looked forward to a time when i could tell customers
that they were riding in my cab .
that i was an owner @-@ operator .
so i scrimped , and i saved ,
until i finally had enough put away to buy a medallion .
but ...
because of the actions of this man ,
i &apos;ve lost that opportunity .
so make no mistake , this--
this trial is not about a busted headlight .
this is a trial about a broken dream .
forget the case , they &apos;re gonna make him president .
statements are like free throws--easy .
nobody &apos;s playing defense .
are we good at defense ?
you would agree that chauffeur drivers cause more accidents--
objection . badgering .
sustained .
objection . argumentative .
leading the witness .
ambiguous .
privileged .
inflammatory .
sustained .
anything further , mr. santana ?
yes , your honor ,
i would like to call to the stand mr. michael ross , please .
what time had you called for the limo
on the morning of the accident ?
uh , we were supposed to leave at 8 : 30 .
and what time did you get to work ?
objection . irrelevant .
it &apos;s highly relevant , your honor .
it speaks to the psychology of the driver , rahim benghazi .
overruled .
answer mr. santana &apos;s question .
8 : 40 .
so unless mr. benghazi made up for that lost time ,
you were going to be late for that meeting , correct ?
yes .
no further questions , your honor .
when the accident occurred ,
you were on your way to the medallion auction .
when and where was this auction to take place ?
9 : 00 a.m. , city hall .
according to the police report ,
the accident occurred 8 : 53 a.m.
that means you only had seven minutes
to get downtown in rush hour traffic .
objection , irrelevant .
i believe when i made the same objection ,
you told his honor it was highly relevant .
overruled .
you were running late ,
only the stakes for you were much higher , weren &apos;t they ?
these things never start on time .
then why was the first medallion
sold 9 : 03 a.m. ?
you were scared your chance at a medallion was going up in smoke ,
and you ran a red .
then you used the accident
to paint me and ray benghazi as a couple of scapegoats .
you can &apos;t prove that .
what color was the light ?
i take the fifth .
you can &apos;t take the fifth , mr. santana .
this isn &apos;t a criminal case .
what color was the light ?
he cut me off .
you claim to love our legal system so much ,
answer the question .
what color was the light ?
what color was the light ?
your honor ?
answer the question , mr. santana .
it just meant so much to me .
your honor ,
can i sidebar with opposing counsel ?
we can roll the dice with the jury ,
but i &apos;d rather settle .
well , how much would i have to pay ?
nothing .
you take responsibility for the accident ,
and your insurance company makes ray whole .
in return ,
i waive my right to collect legal fees .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
don &apos;t say anything .
i &apos;ve got a reputation to maintain .
that goes for you too , judge .
damn it , trevor . i left you like five messages .
good to know your boy &apos;s flaky with everyone .
i was taking it personal .
what do you want ?
well , trevor owes us $ 50,000 he &apos;s never paid ,
so you &apos;re gonna bail him out .
listen , i don &apos;t have that kind of money , okay ? i can &apos;t .
well , if you &apos;re not down here in an hour with it ,
we &apos;re gonna take it out on trevor .
tell him where the money is .
whatever you do , don &apos;t show up .
trevor !
you have one hour .
hello ? hello ?
what do you think you &apos;re doing ,
leaving in the middle of a trial ?
i got some things to take care of .
you mean someone to take care of .
you never cut trevor off , did you ?
no , i didn &apos;t . my friend &apos;s in trouble ,
and i &apos;m gonna help him .
you know what ? this is what addicts do .
the second they start making progress , they screw up ,
because deep down they think
it &apos;s only a matter of time until they fail .
they &apos;d rather fall from the third floor than the penthouse .
nothing you say can stop me .
then tell me what the hell &apos;s going on .
he &apos;s clean . no wires .
are you sure ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
you remember what happened with the guy .
he was 300 pounds .
now , who &apos;d you say you were again ?
trevor &apos;s lawyer .
trevor didn &apos;t mention a lawyer .
he doesn &apos;t know he hired me .
come on .
open the briefcase .
where &apos;s the goddamn money ?
that photo is a screen shot , taken from my firm &apos;s security video .
we know what you look like .
and if mike ross doesn &apos;t hear from me
in the next five minutes , he &apos;s calling the police .
no , man . you &apos;re not comin &apos; in here and threatenin &apos; us .
you &apos;re looking at kidnapping , extortion , and drug @-@ dealing ,
and the district attorney
happens to be number three on my speed dial .
well , if we &apos;re looking at all that time ,
you might as well add murder .
i got a better idea .
retainer agreement .
if you sign right here ,
you &apos;ll become one of my clients .
and i won &apos;t be able to testify against you ,
even if i wanted to .
what about the money ?
this envelope contains $ 10,000 .
consider it a down payment on trevor &apos;s debt .
only here &apos;s the thing ,
i don &apos;t do pro bono work .
and my retainer agreement
requires a down payment of $ 10,000 .
now , as your attorney , my job is to give you advice .
so here &apos;s the deal .
sign the agreement .
i thought i said not to come .
remember that 40 bucks from the fifth grade you owe me ?
if you were dead , how would i collect ?
oh , man .
i &apos;m sorry , i just ...
put you in trouble just by hanging out with you .
so why &apos;d you do it ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m a dick .
bet you didn &apos;t think you &apos;d have to save my ass
so soon after bailing me out .
i wasn &apos;t the one who saved you .
yeah . well , as a friend ,
the guy puts me to shame .
harvey &apos;s not my friend , trust me .
well , he didn &apos;t put his ass on the line because of me .
listen , i pled you down to a misdemeanor--
drunk and disorderly . and i paid the fine .
i think it might be a good idea
if you got out of town for a while .
montana .
well , you said you wanted a clean slate .
i figured 20 hours on a bus ought to do the trick .
oh , yeah , it &apos;ll do me good .
when i get back ,
you know who the first person i &apos;m gonna call is .
yeah . the one person you know who &apos;ll answer .
for you .
what &apos;s this ?
i &apos;m very happy you took ray on pro bono .
you , on the other hand , can afford our services .
you want me
to pay me to represent me ?
mm @-@ hmm . ten hours at $ 1,000 an hour .
eh , yeah , i &apos;ll let you do the math .
you can &apos;t be serious .
i &apos;ll tell you what i am serious about .
i hear you &apos;re finally mentoring the kid .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talkin &apos; about .
really , because i understand
that you dropped the puppy analogy on him ,
which is exactly what i used on you .
may have slipped out by accident .
well , accident , on purpose ,
the really important thing is ,
is that i &apos;m taller than you .
yeah .
yup , you look much thinner in that .
you planted that story , be man enough to own it .
i don &apos;t traffic in the tabloids , harvey .
but i can see how whoever planted this
might find it amusing .
you know , the great harvey specter
bullying a humble cab driver .
i mean , it &apos;s a no @-@ win situation , really .
well , maybe you didn &apos;t hear .
i won the no @-@ win situation .
did it ever occur to you that if you hadn &apos;t done that to me ,
i actually would have owed you one ?
maybe if you didn &apos;t humiliate me in front of the associates--
louis , for an average attorney ,
100 million is a career case .
if i &apos;m mocking you ,
it means i think you &apos;re above average .
but stress balls ? you &apos;re making it too easy .
you put trevor on the bus to the boondocks ?
yeah . can i ask you a question ?
after all this , you really think i &apos;m still buying
the mr. i @-@ don &apos;t @-@ give @-@ a @-@ crap thing ?
joy sent a little token of her appreciation .
she got your hair just right .
did she ever make one of these for you ?
