three words , eight letters .
say it , and i &apos;m yours .
i ...
lair , that &apos;s all i needed to hear .
what do you say we just forget thinking
and follow our hearts ?
yore a part of this legacy , too , nathaniel .
i don &apos;t want to owe him or my family anything .
serena , where &apos;s charles ?
mom , what &apos;s wrong ?
bart &apos;s been in an accident .
my father &apos;s dead because of your father .
i will stand by you through anything .
why would you do that ?
because i love you .
well , that &apos;s too bad .
there &apos;s something you need to know .
just tell me one thing . was it a boy or a girl ?
i had enough trouble
with the idea of mom and rufus dating .
but now i share a sibling with my boyfriend ?
it &apos;s over , isn &apos;t it ?
andrew got caught in aiptide .
yeah , if we had known ,
we wouldn &apos;t have even bothered you .
is it over ?
we &apos;ve already lost one son . we weren &apos;t losing another .
you got here to n.y.u. ? i &apos;m starting in the fall .
uh , i just transferred from b.u.
and tell me if what you feel for me is real .
it &apos;s just a game .
chuck , why did you just do that ?
because i love her .
you &apos;re famous because you are arrested . the end of high school means
the end of me on &quot; gossip girl . &quot; congratulations .
you have a clean slate ... until college .
her dad is marrying lily bass ,
so i think that makes her richer than all of you .
carter . i have something you might want to know before you go .
it &apos;s about santorini , what you were looking for there .
you found my father ?
you were right . i love you , too .
1 , 2 , 3 , here we go ?
welcome back , upper east siders .
after a long , hot summer away ,
i see it didn &apos;t take much time for you to dirty up
the clean slates i gave you .
my inbox is overflowing ,
so let &apos;s get to the good stuff , shall we ?
spotted ... chuck bass up to his old tricks .
poor b.
i guess nothing good lasts forever .
i &apos;m chuck ... bass .
i know .
i wasn &apos;t expecting to see someone like you
somewhere like this so early in the day .
i &apos;m in need of refuge . it &apos;s too hot .
oh , it &apos;s never too hot .
care to test that theory ?
what if i have a girlfriend ?
chuck bass doesn &apos;t do girlfriends .
where &apos;s your limo ?
i gave my driver the day off .
then i guess we &apos;ll have to find someplace else .
as for a certain leggy blonde by a hamptons &apos; pool
looks like serena left big shoes to fill ...
and someone finds them the perfect fit .
well , i found it . and just in time . the car &apos;s here .
now it &apos;s time to go ...
get you dressed ?
mm . no , i &apos;m not leaving .
i don &apos;t think we have a choice .
as soon as we get in that car ,
it means no more beaches and no more bonfires
and no more stalking the barefoot contessa
through 1770 house .
our summer in the hamptons is officially over .
so , uh ... a sit @-@ in ?
more like a lie @-@ in , at least until the sun goes down .
you &apos;re ... you &apos;re sure your dad doesn &apos;t know ?
oh , totally . i mean , we hid all the evidence .
look , dan doesn &apos;t even know .
he &apos;s too busy pre @-@ readin all his books for college .
and i snuck onto his laptop and , uh , might &apos;ve disabled
his &quot; serena van der woodsen &quot; google alert .
yeah , you kown what happens when we get back to the city ?
then it &apos;s serena &apos;s problem .
as now , we made her a promise .
and it is very important to keep those ...
even if they were asked via drunken text
from a turkish pay @-@ as @-@ you @-@ go phone .
our bags are packed . the house is closed up .
but the real question remains .
now that you &apos;ve spent your whole summer
drinking your coffee out of cece &apos;s china ,
will it taste as good coming out of
your &quot; welcome back , kotter &quot; mug at home ?
sure , it was great out here , but i like the real world , too .
since we and lily ... it &apos;s a better @-@ smelling ,
higher thread count version
of the real world , buttill ... yeah .
he you guys aren &apos;t ready ? serena &apos;s gonna be home by 6 : 00 .
i @-@ i mean , how can she even greet us when she gets here ?
isn &apos;t she taking a vow of silence
for a month at the ashram ?
i don &apos;t know . &quot; she , pray , love &quot; thing
of hers is great and all , i @-@ i just highly doubt
she can keep her mouth shut a whole month .
even so , it &apos;s time to leave .
and i think her month is up .
uh , yeah . i need to meet up with vanessa , too ,
&apos;cause she apparently has something to tell me
about how she spent her summer .
wasn &apos;t she in urope with nate ?
ladies and gentlemen , here they are !
well , it &apos;s a good thing the flight attendants
dim the cabin lights over the atlantic .
mm , even better thing
that my car got a flat on the way to heathrow ,
and i missed the plane that i was supposed to on .
otherwise i would &apos;ve been sitting in seat 3b
of an entirely different plane ,
making out with an entely different passenger
in seat 3a .
all right , so now that we &apos;re back on our own turf ,
do i at least get your number ? maybe your last name ?
a little mystery you never heard anyone .
really ? oh , come on .
please . you gotta give me something to go on here .
okay . uh , well , we are going to the same school .
yeah , and columbia &apos;s kind of a big one .
i mean , especially when you factor in graduate school .
you caught that ?
see , you &apos;re a better detective than you think .
well , my car is waiting .
oh , are you done with that ? i &apos;ll take it .
yeah , sure .
ew . on second thought ...
you have a problem with the buckleys ?
yeah , well , that right @-@ wing nut jeb
called william van der bilt a deviant
for lobbying against d.o.m.a.
maybe that &apos;s because william van der bilt
called jeb buckley a cokehead and a cheater .
what , are you saying it isn &apos;t cheating
if you get your congressional aide pregnant ?
oh , my god . you &apos;re nate archibald .
and you &apos;re bree buckley .
you pulled my hair during clinton &apos;s inaugural ball .
your redneck cousins tried to waterboard me
at the easteegg hunt on the white house lawn .
it &apos;s good to see you again .
yeah , take care of yourself .
why not ?
it &apos;s better to wait .
how long ?
oh , let &apos;s see ...
now .
what the hell is going on ? !
blair ... i can explain .
um , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know he had a girlfriend .
yes , you did . she did .
i ...
shame on you , ashley hinshaw . how could you do that ?
pick up someone in a relationship ? !
have you no pride ? no self @-@ respect ?
okay , but i didn &apos;t know that
you may have an abercrombie campaign
and the security code to clooney &apos;s castle in lake como ,
but that doesn &apos;t give you the right to try
to steal someone else &apos;s man !
now take your american girl hair
and your poreless skin and get out !
okay , you &apos;re crazy .
hey .
hi .
oh , thank you .
it &apos;s been three hours . i missed you .
mm . well , let me make it up to you .
let &apos;s get out of here .
or we get stay .
so , uh , jenny &apos;ll take eric &apos;soon .
with chuck at the palace , eric will take his room .
oh , sweet thank you . i really didn &apos;t want to sleep
under chuck &apos;s dirty girl scout painting .
oh , and , uh , dan
yeah i &apos;ll thank you when we get back in brooklyn
and when lily gets back , we &apos;ll join you .
oh , mr. rufus ,
there are some packages i could &apos;t put upstairs .
oh , what are you doing ?
recycling ?
what ?
whoa , whoa . oh my god !
uh , it &apos;s not what you think .
so much for &quot; eat , pray , love . &quot;
well , you know , i guess she got the &quot; love &quot; part right .
you can &apos;t say anything . promise . dan ?
hey vanessa. uh , yeah , i was just about to head down there .
serena ... is home .
hello ? yeah , i &apos;m gonna have to reschedule .
oh , god .
serena !
dan can &apos;t make it .
i think something &apos;s going down with his family .
did he say what it was ?
as for serena van der woodsen ?
you left america a star .
excuse me , please . what the hell is going on ?
i don &apos;t know . please help .
but after your exploits in europe ... right here , - serena !
you &apos;ve come back a supernova .
back up .
and yet , nothing explodes without a fuse .
i wonder what ...
or who make yours .
is , uh , serena up yet ? we were talking till late .
uh , i think i heard her .
whats up ?
money your mother left us for emergencies .
not to boast , but we haven &apos;t used a penny of it all summer
oh . well , thank heaven for salaried servants
and an account at the beach club , right ?
oh , well , i &apos;m glad i have the number for city harvest .
this is all a little much .
a little much ? makes four season look like one season .
mom wanted everybody to feel welcome while she was away .
or she &apos;s trying to bribe us .
what ? no . in fact , she got us a special treat for tomorrow
a table in our name
at van der bilt annual charity polo match in greenwich .
lily thought it would be fun ,
so we are gonna go have fun for lily .
please show your family support by mimicking my expression .
u know , there &apos;ll probably be photographers there .
are you gonna be okay ? you might create another mob scene .
oh , no , no . yeah , i &apos;ll be ... i &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;m really sorry about yesterday . i thought after
the whole arrest scandal , out of sight , out of mind .
i had no idea it would be worse when i got back .
oh , you &apos;ve apologized enough , serena . no one &apos;s blaming you .
now that those vultures have a first shot of your return ,
i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll leave you alone .
it &apos;s not like you &apos;re gonna get arrest again .
no , of course not .
um , i have to go meet blair to go shopping .
you can &apos;t go to a polo match without a hat .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m gonna walk you out .
uh , thank you for the escort ,
but i think i can walk 15 feet without hurting myself .
there was nothing out of sight or out of mind about your trip .
i know what happened .
i- i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
serena , there was no ashram .
i went to ashram ... on a tour .
dan , i appreciate your concern ,
but the little white lies that i tell my family
are none of your business .
rufus is my family .
you didn &apos;t just lie to him . you lied to me .
althose e @-@ mails about the ... the benefits of bikram ?
&quot; ten easy steps to colon cleanse &quot; ?
turns out goop is good for something .
turns out goop is good for something .
what &apos;s really going on here ?
nothing . nothing . i @-@ it was just a few nights of harmless fun .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s it .
all right. all right .
where &apos;d you get that ?
they &apos;re all over the internet .
whatever is going on , you can tell me .
thank you . i @-@ i have to go .
i know it &apos;s a buyer &apos;s market right now ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean there &apos;s actually anything worth buying .
why don &apos;t you just stay at the palace ?
i &apos;m done living in my father &apos;s shadow
and that inludes his hotel .
and running his company ?
lily was doing an amazing job overseeing the board before she left .
why not let her continue
what about you ? any word from the van der bilt compound
since you &apos;ve been back ?
not a word . torrow &apos;s the family polo match .
i mean , when i skipped out on the internship
at the mayor &apos;s office , i knew they &apos;d be mad ,
but now i &apos;m getting the silent treatment .
so if they &apos;re mad already ,
why don &apos;t you call the girl from the plane ?
no , i &apos;m not gonna use bree to send some message .
you &apos;re missing one key detail ...
sleeping with the enemy is hot .
why do you think i had the whole ivanka thing ?
look , i don &apos;t want to stir up stuff with my family .
look , if you think they &apos;re done trying to control you ,
you &apos;re wrong , and while you &apos;re waiting for your proof ,
why not take bree buckley out on the town ?
have some fun with a girl you like
and show your family that you &apos;re your own man .
being accepted for who you are is crucial , nathaniel .
like blair accepts me .
wait , you do what ?
i go to europe for three months ,
and you turn from jane austen to anais nin .
is there anything chuck bass can &apos;t get you to do ?
it was my idea .
no . no , it wasn &apos;t .
yeah . we ... we had our honeymoon period , and it was perfect ,
but ... while other couples settle into a routine ,
we we determined to keep things interesting .
so chuck plays the cheating bastard ,
and i play the scorned woman .
i even get to choose who to humiliate ...
models , tourists , upper west siders ,
i don &apos;t know if anybody ever told you this ,
but the honeymoon is supposed to end . it isn &apos;t real .
the real part is when you settle down with each other .
the 3 @-@ month milestone .
it is not a milestone . it &apos;s a gravestone .
settling down means death ... less sex , more silence .
we found a way to avoid that that works for us .
wow . you guys sure about that ?
i mean , if you don &apos;t mind me saying so , i ...
well , i think i know blair pretty well .
look , i would so like to retire
any mention of the whole &quot; jules and jim &quot; thing .
all right .
but listen , the games may seem like fun .
are you sure blair &apos;s not just playing for you ?
cause if she &apos;s not doing it for herself , too ...
well , things could get mess .
if you love him , then lock him down .
open relationships only invite chaos .
trust me . i know .
it &apos;s not an open relationship . we &apos;re completely monogamous .
it &apos;s just one of our games , like the rest .
yeah , until it isn &apos;t anymore , playing the scorned woman .
and actually being the scorned woman
is a slippy slope . b , college is about to start .
what happens when one day you don &apos;t get there in time ,
and he actually kisses someone else , or worse ?
he wouldn &apos;t .
ugh . i still have no idea why they &apos;re following me .
oh , please. spare me , s.
i get every edition of &quot; hello ! &quot; and &quot; ok ! &quot; there is .
i know what you did this summer , and who .
cristiano ronaldo ?
i hope you got your shots before you traveled .
should i be worried ?
no .
no , i just had a great time .
i just wish that they would leave me alone .
oh. is that why you got your hair blown out ?
listen to your quality problems .
serena &apos;s being chased by paparazzi ,
my dad and sister are house @-@ sitting a penthouse ,
and i have a farmer &apos;s tan .
all right . okay . you got me .
the good life is ... is actually ... it &apos;s pretty good .
what , uh , what was so important
that you had to bring me here to tell me in person ?
i hope it &apos;s not about nate .
oh , we hooked up one night in prague , but it was not a big deal .
but after i came back and started hanging out at this place ...
please tell me you &apos;re not working here .
i am so done serving coffee . thank god .
just made some new friends one in particular .
he was here this morning .
oh . so you are dating someone .
his name &apos;s scott ,
and i think you guys would really like each other .
we actually met him here in the spring like 5 seconds .
he just transfered .
we &apos;ve been hanging out , and , okay ,
maybe there &apos;s been a little bit of flirting .
oh . thank you .
here , let me get it .
okay , wait. why do you have a knockoff designer wallet ?
i thought you hated intellectual property theft .
oh , it &apos;s to hold all your $ 100 bills .
do you know how hard it is to break one of those things ?
i don &apos;t even know why they make them .
i &apos;m kidding . sort of .
it ... not a knockoff .
it &apos;s a graduation present from lily , as is what &apos;s in it .
and you know what ? i @-@ i thought i &apos;d never use it ,
but have you seen the stitching ?
oh , my god .
dan humpey &apos;s been seduced by wealth. it had to happen .
even frodo eventually gave in to the power of the ring .
oh , come on . i &apos;m still me . i just have a nicer wallet .
and as for youfriend , i &apos;d love to meet him .
how about tomorrow ?
we can do brooklyn things like go to the dumpling truck
and play &quot; signed or unsigned &quot; on the promenade .
that sounds great , but i , uh ,
i have to do this thing for my dad , so ...
okay. we &apos;ll find time . walk you to the subway ?
nah , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m on the 6 .
oh. right .
see ? still me .
you left these .
oh. thanks .
these are my friend &apos;s .
mr. humphrey ,
the camera people are in the trash outside . your trash .
all right. thanks , vanya . i don &apos;t understand .
serena &apos;s arrest was months ago .
why did they still care about her .
her clothes .
her hair .
her hair .
her style .
what do you know that i don &apos;t know ?
where have you been ?
i &apos;ve been calling you for an hour .
i was with nate . why ?
nate. no reason .
i &apos;ve arranged a little go @-@ see at a modeling agency downtown .
we should pick someone out together ,
take her back to my place .
or we could just stay in .
whatever you want .
no . it &apos;s fine . we &apos;ll go . we &apos;ll go .
i &apos;ll go get my purse .
oh . i @-@ i see the cat &apos;s out of the bag .
and , uh , topless on valentino &apos;s yacht .
ooh , that &apos;s not fair. everyone &apos;s topless on valentino &apos;s yacht .
what about this one where she &apos;s dancing on the table ?
uh , well , that &apos;s what you do in barcelona .
and the one where prince harry &apos;s
doing shots off of her ... that &apos;s what she did in st. andrews
some of these pictures he the same guy in them ,
but you can &apos;t quite make him out . i wonder who he is .
where you headed , beautiful ?
carter .
i was in the neighborhood .
no , you weren &apos;t .
gossip girl said you &apos;d returned . i wanted to see you .
well , you &apos;ve seen me .
now you can go .
we need to talk .
no , we don &apos;t .
mm . i know what you &apos;re doing .
you can &apos;t avoid what happened forever .
watch me .
oh , no !
spotted ... serena van der woodsen
giving carter baizen the slip .
we have all see the select .
but what happened between them when tmz was m.i.a. ?
something tells me the truth is just out of focus .
well , you were right .
your family ?
wants me exactly where i used to be ,
except they actually gave me
the wheels to get there this time .
check this out &quot; nate , most unfortunate you missed out on the summer .
good thing fall internships begin next week . &quot;
sorry , man .
don &apos;t be . it &apos;s about time i broke off from them
once and for all ,
and i think i know how i &apos;m gonna do it .
i just don &apos;t know why he felt he had to lie to me .
i don &apos;t think it was really a lie .
thank you .
he said he was taking the subway
when he had a limo waiting ,
and not to mention ,
he told me he was helping his dad tomorrow ,
when gossip girl says he &apos;s attending
the van der bilt &apos;s polo match in a dior suit .
oh , is this the part where no one pretend to know
what dior means ?
i mean , why keep these things secret from me ?
is he worried that i &apos;m gonna judge him ?
i wonder why he might even think that .
i &apos;m not judging ! i get it .
if i had a limo that followed me around , i &apos;d take it , too .
i &apos;m his best friend , and i support him no matter what ...
even if he were rich and dressed like truman capote .
yeah , you should probably tell him that .
i should .
too bad he &apos;s that polo match with his family ?
his whole family ?
yeah , and nate &apos;s family ,
and i &apos;m sure blair and chuck will be there ,
if the murder @-@ suicide i predicted hasn &apos;t happened yet .
well , why don &apos;t you just call his dad ?
from what you &apos;ve said , you sound pretty close to him .
say you han &apos;t seen a lot of dan lately and you &apos;d like to go .
you think i should invite myself to a charity polo match ?
yeah . just show up , tell dan how great he looks in his suit ,
and if he has room ,
you &apos;d love a ride back to the city in his limo .
i &apos;ve never been to a polo match .
maybe you can get a plus one .
maybe .
needs a sandwich ,
she looks just right to me .
adam &apos;s apple .
blair .
catalogue !
chuck , none of these girls e even worth humiliating .
looking in the mirror will do that for them .
is everything okay ?
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing &apos;s going on . why ?
this is one @-@ stop shopping ,
and you &apos;re acting like everything last season .
i thought you wanted to play .
i did . i do .
i did .
the summer was great .
we had a lot of fun .
but maybe summer &apos;s over .
okay .
if that &apos;s what you want .
is that what you want ?
i want you to be happy
however that &apos;s achieved .
let &apos;s go home .
it , uh , looks ...
smaller ?
yeah .
your mom bought these for me for cotillion , with cece .
how &apos;s she doing ?
um , not great .
and the longer my mom &apos;s gone , the more i worry
that grandma &apos;s treatments aren &apos;t going well .
but your dad &apos;s been doing a great job holding it all together .
at least , he &apos;s pretending to .
well , having your summer plans change ,
stuck in charge of two kids that you didn &apos;t raise
in a house that you don &apos;t own ...
yeah , i know . it sounds like a reality show premise . uh ...
it &apos;s gotta be getting to him .
plus the whole thing with serena .
the last time she went off the deep end ,
she got rely messed up .
yeah . i wonder what really happened this summer .
well , now that rufus knows , maybe we &apos;ll find out .
what is it ? grandma ?
no , it &apos;s you .
i &apos;m sorry . he found out .
uh , before i get angry , why don &apos;t you tell me what happened ?
because i &apos;d really like to not use my imagination
when it comes to these pictures .
you don &apos;t have to if you look close enough .
i ... i &apos;ll shut up .
rufus , i know i shouldn &apos;t have lied ,
but i was in europe and i had just graduated ,
and i got a little carried away .
and what happens in summer stays in summer , right ?
look , the only reason i didn &apos;t tell you
is because i thought if i did ,
you &apos;d think i &apos;d gone off the rails again .
did you ?
no .
no , ev ... everything i said to you last night was true .
i
i &apos;m done .
we &apos;ll put it behind us , then ?
and in what is perhaps an ironic twist ,
due to your current social status ,
the polo socie has asked if you will
throw in the first ball at the match tomorrow .
i &apos;d love to .
i &apos;ll go call &apos; em back . your mom will be proud .
yeah , i ... i didn &apos;t want to alarm my dad any further or anything ,
but , uh , there was one guy who was
in a lot of those pictures with you who ... who was that ?
carter baizen .
we traveled together at the beginning of summer .
but then things got weird , and ... and now he &apos;s stalking me .
he ... he &apos;s been stalking me ever since .
and , uh , i don &apos;t know what to do .
he won &apos;t leave me alone .
so ... hey , whoa , whoa , whoa .
w @-@ what ... what are you saying ?
lo , if you hear from him or see him ,
just please keep him away from me at all costs .
i &apos;m worried what he might do .
it &apos;s blair , leave a message .
hey , blair , it &apos;s dan .
i @-@ i know i &apos;m not someone you want
to hear from late at night ,
or any hour , but i need your help. uh , call me .
this just in an unlikely alliance
is forming on the upper east side .
yeahmom , everything &apos;s great .
i have been waiting all summer for reed to start ,
and tomorrow &apos;s the day i get to do
what i came here for .
too bad it may be too late to do any good .
last year , i had to go to the white party
as your date
in a dress that i made myself . and this year ...
oh , mrs. jennifer humphrey . when did you g married ?
it doesn &apos;t matter , okay ? it &apos;sngraved !
miss van dder woodsen .

uh , no , it &apos;s okay .
i won &apos;t do anything worth publishing ,
not even a smile . i should find blair .
well , the bad news is , your last name &apos;s buckley .
but the good news is
knowing this information made you a lot easier to find .
yeah ? well , i knew you couldn &apos;t stay away .
hey , there &apos;s someone i want you to meet .
oh , my god . is that ...
grandfather .
nathaniel . so nice to see you .

i &apos;ve always been a fan of your music .
carter ?
waldorf .
can &apos;t say it &apos;s good to see you .
no , you can &apos;t ,
not after what i &apos;m about to tell you .
the invitation you got to come this party
wasn &apos;t exactly what y thought .
spare me . where &apos;s serena ?
this him ?
you &apos;ve been served .
what the hell is this ?
it &apos;s a restraining order .
this says i have to stay away fr blair waldorf .
yeah , and until further notice ,
you &apos;ll find me by serena &apos;s side .
step within 100 feet of me and you &apos;ll be arrested .
and about how far you think he is from me ?
yeah , i don &apos;t think he &apos;s far enough .
i agree . security !
hey ! hey , uh , what &apos;soing on here ?
oh , your friends , uh , are trying to have me removed .
right , because you &apos;re stalking me .
look , you don &apos;t have to talk to him .
you told them was stalking you ?
you wanna tell tm the truth or should i ?
what &apos;s the truth ?
yeah , carter . what &apos;s the truth ?
sooner or later , you &apos;re gonna be alone ,
with no one taking your picture .
what will you do then ?
wait , serena .
what ... what is he talking about ? miss van der woodsen ,
the first chukker is about to begin .
you need to take position for the first throw in .
yes , of course .
thank you , acho .
uh , good @-@ bye , carter .
serena , wait !
no , wait , it , wait. you gotta tell us what &apos;s going on !
later !
i &apos;m chuck bass .
alexandra .
i don &apos;t believe it .
uh , well , all right , if she can &apos;t explain it ,
then maybe carter ...
you found a bootleg copy of that concert ? wow .
yeah , i bet i have a recording off the board somewhere .
i mean , i could get it to vanessa for you if you &apos;d like .
i &apos;d love that . in fact , um ...
hey . i &apos;m gonna borrow this horse .
forget a grand entrance .
everybody knows it &apos;s the exit they &apos;ll remember .
hey . i just got your text. what &apos;s ... what &apos;s going on ?
you didn &apos;t tell me that you were bringing me to a family event .
w ... so ?
listen , i really like you .
and if your being here happens to piss off my grandfather ,
to be honest , i figured you &apos;d like that .
you &apos;re right .
hey , look , normally i &apos;d totally ...
... be on board the &quot; let &apos;s piss off grandpa train , &quot;
but what don &apos;t you know is that ...
currently , my family isn &apos;t speaking to me ,
which is something that , unlike you , i &apos;d like to change .
being on a row at a van der bilt charity event
doesn &apos;t exactly send that message .
i didn &apos;t know . i &apos;m sorry .
look , my family is used to controlling me like yours obviously does .
and i rebelled , like you obviously do ,
except i took off to europe .
a year into it , i ...
found out that my cousin who &apos;s , like , a sister to me ,
got stood up at the altar , and i wasn &apos;t there for her
because i was trying to prove some stupid point .
i &apos;m just trying to find my way back in .
i happened to bump into you along the way .
well , i &apos;m glad you did .
and despite what it may look like ,
the main reason i tracked you down
was because i wanted to see you again .
if that means keeping a low profile , i &apos;m up for it .
i know that secrecy is a lot to ask for .
i really can &apos;t risk making my family more upset right now .
hey , don worry . i &apos;m good at secret relationships .
i &apos;ve had a bit of practice .
i figured you weren &apos;t ...
... planning on riding all the way back to the city .
why won &apos;t you leave me alone , carter ?
you &apos;re not my boyfriend .
no , but i seem to be the only one you tell your secrets to .
well , i guess that was a mistake .
dropping your dress , stealing a horse ?
all it is is a cry for attention .
all it is is a cry for attention .
i don &apos;t need to cry for attention .
i &apos;m getting plenty on my own , in case you haven &apos;t noticed .
yeah , plenty from everyone except the one you want it from .
that &apos;s not true .
he didn &apos;t want to see you , serena .
no , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s not what happened .
we spent a month chasing him down and then we found him .
he couldn &apos;t even meet you face @-@ to @-@ face .
well , maybe he didn &apos;t get my mesege .
or he didn &apos;t realize who i was .
or he didn &apos;t realize who his daughter was ?
serena , what if your dad didn &apos;t want to see you ?
who cares ? who the hell is he not to want you ?
i would &apos;ve stayed all summer with you .
but after that ,
you ditched me and ran again .
well , there the two of you are .
i &apos;ve been looking for you everywhere .
we were just discussing how we were gonna get back to the city .
well , i &apos;ll get you home .
no , thank you. we &apos;ll find o own way .
i &apos;m not gonna be taking the internship , grandfather .
i hope you can understand that .
of course i can .
how many times must i tell you , nathaniel ?
i want to be your family. work wherever , date whomever .
i won &apos;t stand in your way .
i , uh , just want you to be happy .
i almost believe you .
that &apos;s enough for me .
and if i &apos;m right in guessing that you two are hiding out here
because miss buckley would prefer
to keep her presence unknown ...
why search for a cab and risk being seen ?
okay .
i &apos;m giving it back in the morning .
tripp , it &apos;s me .
remember how we &apos;ve always wanted
to do something about the buckleys ?
i think i may have found a way .
excuse me .
have you seen mr. bass anywhere ?
you just missed him. he left about five minutes ago .
was he alone ?
well , there was a woman who left about the same time .
was she blonde ?
tall , stunning
and every man &apos;s fantasy ?
spotted ... blair waldorf learning
that just because you get out of the game
doesn &apos;t mean someone isn &apos;t waiting on the bench
to take your place .
i know stuff &apos;s going on with your family , so i &apos;m just gonna go .
ok , why do you come here ?
honestly , right now i &apos;m not sure .
maybe people just change .
maybe it okay if we grow apart .
vanessa , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not changing .
you &apos;re at a polo match in a $ 3,000 suit .
and your name &apos;s in the program .
and after i take a bus across the state line to apologize ,
you ditch me for blair waldorf and totally disappear .
cece set me up with this suit , all right ?
and jenny got a dress , too
if you &apos;d also like to make her feel bad about it . as for blair ,
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re shoe shopping or sipping martinis .
there ... there &apos;s something going on with serena .
and what is that ?
i- i wish i knew .
all i do know is that lily &apos;s mother is very sick .
my dad is struggling keep it together ,
not to mention my family is ... just generally in the middle
of a massive transition . so , please , please ,
give me a break with the &quot; rich people suck &quot; thing .
i don &apos;t care if you &apos;re rich , which you aren &apos;t , by the way .
ride in a limo , break a hundred.that &apos;s fine .
but if you &apos;re gonna be in this world ,
be yourself in this world .
&apos;cause i actually like that guy ,
and i hope he &apos;s the one who turns up at n.y.u.
what &apos;s so funny ?
old habits die hard .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll ... find my way .
anybody seen a girl in an orange dress ?
chuck ! where is she ?
what are you talking about ?
do you really expect me to believe
you don &apos;t have her stashed here ?
i came back from the party because i had a headache .
didn &apos;t you get my messages ?
i must have left my phone on the table .
what if we need games ?
what if without them we &apos;re boring ?
we could never be boring .
you say that , but i know you .
you &apos;re chuck bass .
i &apos;m not chuck bass without you .
running to get here all the way from connecticut ...
was pretty exciting .
do you know where alexandra lives ?
how about we stay in instead ?
well , that wasn &apos;t so much fun , was it ?
depends on your definition of fun .
i &apos;m sorry i brought you .
the humphreys are going through a lot ,
and i don &apos;t even know if dan and i are even still friends .
i know they &apos;re dealing with stuff , um ,
but they seem like good people to me .
and you and dan have been friends for so long ,
maybe you shouldn &apos;t write that off because of one argument .
let &apos;s not even talk about it anymore .
are you sure ?
cause if you need to talk ...
i don &apos;t ...
i think i &apos;ve done enough talking for one night .
and i thought one of us should finally make the first move ,
maybe turn this night around .
i &apos;m glad you did .
growing up means one thing ... independence .
i &apos;ll be right back .
we all want it .
sometimes we use other people to try to get it for ourselves .
waiter , this glass is dirty ,
and i &apos;ve been waiting far too long .
well , i apologize , ma &apos;am .
surely there &apos;s some way i can make up for the poor service .
i can think of a few ways .
sometimes we find it in each other .
the party you are trying to reach is not available at the moment .
please leave a message .
hey , it &apos;s serena again .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re getting these message
or if you even check this number ,
but i just want you to know
that i &apos;m not gonna stop trying to get your attention .
i &apos;m gonna do whatever it takes for however long . bye .
sometimes our independence comes at the cost of something else
and that cost can be high .
i hope i &apos;m doing the right thing .
you wanted to keep serena out of the papers .
dad , this is the way do it .
you own all the pictures now .
oh , not all of them .
therere is still one photographer
that my group hasn &apos;t been able reach yet .
because more often than not , in order to gain our independence
we have to fight .
can you guarantee that these will run in europe and asia ?
i &apos;ll try my best .
good , &apos; cause i wanna make sure
my father sees these wherever he goes .
never give up . never surrender .
