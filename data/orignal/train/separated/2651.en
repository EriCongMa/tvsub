We've got 20 minutes.
There are three sleepers in this main room.
And one in the master bedroom. Time is short,
so we won't be doing cut-downs on site.
I've got a carpet van en route.
I want a full scrub. Cheyenne, windows.
Haunani, floors. We have 18 minutes, ladies.
Let's get to work.
♬Ooh, and it's all right and it's coming' 'long♬
♬We gotta get right back to where we started from♬
♬Love is good, love can be strong♬
♬We gotta get right back to where we started from♬
♬Do you remember the day♬
You're a lucky one, sugar. We're gonna leave you alive,
so you can deliver a message to Reddington personally.
Tell him we know.
♬If you get hurt♬
♬By the little things I say♬
♬I can put that smile back on your face♬
♬Ooh, and it's all right and it's coming long♬
Hello?
♬Love is good♬
♬Love can be strong♬
Yes.
♬We gotta get right back to where we started from♬
Yes, I understand.
♬All right and it's coming long♬
Please, not at all.
I've been waiting for this day for a while.
I'll be in D.C. soon.
♬We gotta get right back to where we started from♬
♬All right, and it's coming long♬
♬We gotta get right back♬
I feel terrible about this.
Don't. I mean, if anything, feel relieved.
A week ago, I was facing 16 counts of capital murder.
Besides, I still got my personal piece and a C.C.P.
Liz, you're a convicted felon.
They withdrew your concealed carry permit.
I'm gonna have to confiscate any other firearms
you have in your possession.
Will I at least be issued a weapon for field operations?
You're a consultant, not a sworn officer.
You won't be going on field operations.
What you are going to be is a phenomenal resource.
Your ability as a profiler is
I'm good. It's okay.
I appreciate the pep talk, but I'm good.
I really am.
That makes one of us.
I told myself I wasn't gonna cry so I'm gonna make this quick.
Apparently not quick enough.
We love you, Agent Keen.
You see, that's...
I'm not an agent anymore.
I put you all in an impossible situation.
And for reasons I'll never quite understand,
you gave me the benefit of every doubt,
even Mr. I'm-just-doing-my-job.
You did so much more than that.
There's nothing harder than hunting one of our own,
especially when she's innocent.
Hey, in all my years with the bureau,
I'm proud of the jobs all of you did.
What have you heard from Reddington?
I feel like you're overreacting.
Given the circumstances, I don't believe that's possible.
About the ladies --
Their families know they'll be well provided for.
Thank you, dearie.
Hello, Elizabeth. Word of caution --
He's in a bad mood.
What do you know about Shell Island?
Never heard of it.
Please.
The Shell Island Retreat is the pet name
for an assembly of affiliated criminal organizations.
I'm sorry, wait. Are you giving me a case?
You look surprised.
I thought maybe after all we've been through the past three months
that you might want to take a break.
I mean, aren't you exhausted?
Your past three months have been what my life has been like
for the past 25 years.
I'm often exhausted.
The Shell Island Retreat is a ritual
that dates back to the roaring '20s.
The de facto master of ceremonies
is Marcus Caligiuri,
next in line to Espen van der Merwe,
but to assume leadership in the Pater Dei group,
the world's oldest and largest weapons dealer.
The leaders of the Bratva, Yakuza,
and assorted international cartels.
They gather when they are presented with a problem so difficult,
it can only be resolved by enemies working together.
And where is this Shell Island?
There is no Shell Island. It's just a name.
The actual location of the meeting
is always a closely guarded secret.
I'd have thought you would've been invited.
Howard Jasnoch. He's a competitor of mine.
He's arranged transport for the individual
who called the meeting.
And who is that?
I don't know.
What I do know is if he's called a meeting
and the members are gathering, he's a very big fish.
Whatever is troubling him,
whatever has caught the attention of these men is critical.
No less than an existential threat.
These meetings are infrequent, Lizzy,
Making this a very rare opportunity.
Follow this fish, and you can net the entire school.
Dmitri Sarkovski, the C.E.O. of Vitus One Bank,
helped orchestrate and now profits
from the Greek financial collapse.
Espen van der Merwe...
Wanted by the Hague on, uh,
accessory charges for a slew of war crimes.
All of them are at large for charges,
including narcotics trafficking, smuggling,
cyber crimes, and assassination.
And Reddington has confirmed that all of them
will be in attendance at this meeting?
The Shell Island Retreat provides a rare opportunity
to capture the heads
of some of the most lethal organized crime syndicates.
Does he know where this meeting will take place?
He knows someone who does -- Howard Jasnoch.
He's an underworld travel agent of sorts.
According to Reddington,
he's preparing travel for one of the attendees.
Hang on. I got a flag on him.
Georgetown address.
Roll out, people.
Keen.
Sorry.
Instinct.
It's not so bad.
I downloaded the fourth series of "Doctor Who" on the mainframe.
Tom Baker is amazing.
We need to go to your boat.
Yeah.
Now.
Okay.
Wait.
I gotta do one thing.
Okay, uh...
This is a washer.
But I promise you, I'm gonna replace it
with something so much better.
Elizabeth Keen...
will you marry me?
I know I wasn't the best husband.
But I-I can be.
I can be. I don't wanna be anyone else.
I don't know what to say.
"Yes." You can say..."yes."
Tom...
If I've learned one thing from being on the run
these past few months,
it's that I can't tell you
what I'm gonna want 10 years from now.
Even a year from now.
I just know what I want right now.
♬Tricky anaconda♬
♬Coming down the rabbit hole♬
♬Did you ever wonder♬
So, this isn't a no?
♬How it's gonna go♬
♬Coming out from under♬
♬Round you go♬
♬I got you where I want you♬
♬Never know never know♬
♬Oh, I got you where I want you♬
♬Where to go♬
♬Well, this one is gonna cost ya♬
Howard Jasnoch.
We know you're moving a client
to the Shell Island Retreat.
I want a name and location now.
I don't have a name, I swear.
Only an address.
F.B.I.! Hands, hands!
Who are you?
Move, move!
Ressler.
Who are you? I said!
Reddington.
Raymond Reddington.
Where have you been?
I came as soon as I got the call.
Who is this guy? He claims he's Reddington?
Yes, and we can't disprove it with D.N.A.
Because there's nothing on file from 1990
when Reddington disappeared.
Whoever he is, he has got intel
on nearly every blacklister Mr. Reddington has brought us.
There's criminal histories, rap sheets,
news clippings written when they were captured or killed.
He doesn't even look like him.
Well, in the five years I hunted Reddington,
we had one photo of him.
It only had a passing resemblance
to the man we've been working with.
He disappeared 25 years ago. Could've had surgery.
Truth is nobody really knows what he might look like today.
But whoever he is, he has too much classified data
for us not to take him seriously.
I wanna know what he knows and how he knows it.
So...
You're Raymond Reddington?
Must make you wonder who you've been working with
these past few years.
Why don't you tell me about the case files?
You know, for years, I couldn't figure out
why my colleagues were being targeted.
I didn't understand.
And then I saw you on TV with him.
You're the fugitive.
Agent Keen, right?
You were in possession of classified data.
How did you get it?
I knew someone was helping the F.B.I.
Imagine my surprise when I realized it was me.
Ray Reddington.
The case files --
how are they connected to Shell Island?
You keep calling them "case files."
These were people.
My friends.
They were criminals who were taken down by the bureau.
With the help of a man you call Raymond Reddington.
He's an imposter. He's using you.
You wanna know about the case files?
About Shell Island?
I'll tell you,
as soon as you give me 10 minutes with him,
face to face.
The F.B.I. has no relationship with Raymond Reddington.
No, they don't. But they think they do.
The cases you've given us,
he said that you've been targeting his colleagues.
He's a probe.
When we brought him in,
he was in possession of classified data.
I'm not interested in the data he has.
I'm interested in the data he's looking for,
about me and my relationship with this task force.
The manhunt exposed your relationship to Liz.
Yes, people are talking
about whether I'm cooperating with the F.B.I.
Rumors are swirling.
And whoever he is,
he was sent to determine whether those rumors are true.
Has our friend arrived yet?
I'm excited to speak with him.
I know you're there,
and I know you told them about Shell Island.
But since you're not me, you didn't receive an invitation,
and you don't know when and where the meeting is taking place.
I do. Of course you need a taste.
That's how this works, right?
He trades information on his friends
to get what he wants.
Taste this --
an F.B.I. executive is going to be taken.
I can save her.
In exchange, I want a meeting with him.
Face to face.
He's bluffing.
He has nothing to gain
by gaming us and everything to lose.
If you agree to talk to him,
you're acknowledging we work together.
Yeah, but if he doesn't, an innocent person could die.
Reddington, you cannot --
Hello there.
Are you enjoying the accommodations?
Ah, there he is. Excellent.
Let's begin.
In less than an hour,
an F.B.I executive, Janet Macnamara,
will be abducted by my friend and regular at Shell Island,
Marcus Caligiuri.
Okay, Macnamara, Janet P.
Uh, she runs the F.B.I.'s human intelligence unit.
She's not an agent? Why would she be a target?
She's a high-level executive
cleared to know all bureau assets,
including C.I.s like Reddington.
Caligiuri needs confirmation about our relationship,
she can give it to him.
Okay, she's not at work.
She's picking up her son at a piano lesson.
41st and Macaroy in Hyattsville.
Ressler, Navabi, get there now.
Oh, sorry. No, it's cool.
I got somewhere I gotta be, so...
It's a secure building. There's a 24-hour patrol officer.
It's the perfect apartment for a young woman like you.
I love it. Here's my application.
How soon can I move in?
Um, soon as possible, Miss...Keen.
Elizabeth Keen?
Yes. Is there a problem?
No.
It's just...
There are a number of other prospective tenants
who've already submitted applications.
But I thought you said -- - We'll review your application
and get right back to you.
I see.
Okay.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
We're looking for Janet Macnamara.
I'll need a minute to check.
We good?
We're fine.
Because you didn't say anything on the way over.
You didn't just fire me.
We slept together one day, and you fired me the next.
It's a little more complicated than it, uh, sounds.
Room 5B.
Thank you.
Janet Macnamara?
Yes?
Agent Ressler, F.B.I. This is Agent Navabi.
For your safety, you need to come with us right now.
What's happened?
We'll explain it to you on the way.
No, I'm not going anywhere without my son.
Whatever you're here for, this must be some kind of mistake.
We got a problem.
Come here.
Get back in your room.
Stay down!
Don't shoot!
Everybody back in your room! F.B.I.
Just the woman I was looking for.
Mom, no!
Let her go! Mom!
Tyler, stay there!
Janet! Hey, where's your mother?
Stay there.
You.
Who are you?
March 8, 1985, I ran point on an attack
on the Beirut home of Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah.
June 1989, I coordinated operation minesweep,
which provided back office support and oversight
for naval intelligence operations in Kuwait
carried out by the 160th S.O.A.R.
The OP was off the books but can be confirmed
by Assistant Director Harold Cooper.
How the hell does he know that?
If I'm not who I say I am,
how would I know that Raymond Reddington held TS-SCI clearance
from the office of Naval Intelligence?
If I'm not Reddington, how would I know that four years ago
he hosted the Shell Island Retreat
at a chateau in ile-de-France?
I must confess to feeling curiously flattered.
Hook us up to a forensic polygraph
and ask the only question that matters --
are you an imposter?
I'll submit to the test.
Will you?
How'd he know about Fadlallah?
Did you host a Shell Island Retreat four years ago?
I did.
But you can't tell us where it's being held this year?
Why didn't you take him up on the polygraph test?
Because I can defeat a polygraph.
So can he, or he wouldn't have suggested it.
If I were you, Harold,
I'd concern myself with finding Janet Macnamara,
who apparently knows all about our little arrangement here.
You need to find Janet before she talks.
I forgot how much it sickens me to come here.
Then why bother?
Why give a guy like that the time of day?
Because my life depends on it.
Not if you move on.
We beat Berlin and the Cabal.
Isn't that enough for you?
It is for me.
Is it?
I-I know I'm lucky the way things turned out,
but I can't even rent an apartment
because people think I'm a criminal.
Tom thinks we should just go away and start over.
Maybe he's right.
Tom.
There's something you need to see.
The Cabal is in green.
Their affiliates are in red.
Their competition is in blue.
Since I've been a fugitive,
The pestilence on this map has only grown.
This is what we're up against --
a multi-headed hydra.
You cut off one head, it grows two others,
you have to cut off every head
and burn the rest of it.
It's a mythic battle,
and it's not anywhere close to being over.
It's your battle, not mine.
I wish that were true, Lizzy.
But the manhunt revealed certain facts
that had long been hidden... about you.
Me?
Katarina Rostova was a name
that had been lost to history.
Masha Rostova was never more than suspicion and rumor.
The manhunt and the publicity it generated
changed all of that.
But who would care
that I'm Katarina Rostova's daughter?
The daughter of a legendary spymaster,
the secret-keeper who disappeared --
Disappeared?
You and Sam told me she's dead.
The secrets she took with her could compromise
any number of players on that map.
They'll be coming. They'll be coming for you.
But I don't know anything.
They don't know that.
You can't walk away, Lizzy.
They won't let you.
Who are you?
Knowing my name is no way to stay alive.
So let's forgo introductions,
shall we, Janet?
What do you want?
Information.
One of two men will die today.
One is a killer -- filth who deserves what he gets.
The other one is a cabinetmaker.
No.
He's very good with his hands.
He has an eye for beautiful design and fine details.
I'm sure that's why you married him.
If you tell me what I need to know,
I'll make certain
the right man dies today.
Janet Macnamara's been taken.
To get her back,
we have to find Caligiuri.
I want the location of the Shell Island Retreat.
I'm not the F.B.I. informant.
Reddington doesn't know where they're meeting.
Unless he knows exactly where it is
because it's the scene of his next command performance.
That's why he had me arrested --
so I'd be here while he's putting on his show.
He's using you to take my seat at the table.
What do you want?
Let me walk.
Not gonna happen.
If you do,
I will tell you where the Retreat is taking place.
You said you weren't an informant.
I lied. I'm a criminal. He exploited me.
He's exploiting you, too.
I get my freedom.
You get a dozen major criminals.
I mean, forget it. The guy's unreliable.
Everything he has said has checked out.
It's our best chance at finding Macnamara.
For all we know,
he could've staged her abduction to increase his value.
A woman's life hangs in the balance.
Trusting him is a risk we have to take.
I disagree.
Well, it's not your decision to make anymore, is it?
Sir?
Make the deal. Put a wire on him.
Don't let him out of your sight.
We cut a deal --
immunity in exchange for taking us to the meeting.
We're marshalling strike teams now.
Harold is nothing if not predictable.
I know you said you don't know where this meeting is,
and I want to believe you,
but if this is another one of your games,
if you have some sort of hidden agenda,
and you plan on going, don't.
If we show up and you're there,
it'll only confirm their suspicions.
Thank you for your concern, Lizzy.
Borsheim.
Thank you.
Reddington. Fashionably late as always, huh?
Marcus.
Hello, everyone.
It's good to see so many friends and even more enemies.
Welcome to Shell Island.
Cheers.
You'll be recording evidence of a conspiracy
which will be used in their prosecution
and to justify your release.
If you could remove your jacket.
This isn't the T.S.A.
These people have real security.
Before I'm allowed to even
set foot in the penthouse dining room,
I'll be diverted into an adjoining suite.
I'll be asked to relinquish all weapons and personal items.
I will then be relieved of electronic devices
and asked for a password.
Borsheim. My clothes will be physically and electronically inspected
before I step out onto the 22nd floor.
Which is why we'll be deploying
the latest surveillance tech from the C.I.A.
What about transmitter intercepts?
The transmitters run on a delay.
Once activated, they won't come online for four minutes.
And during that window,
they can't be detected by security.
What if it takes longer than four minutes
to get through security?
Let's hope it doesn't.
Comforting to see that everyone's appetites
for food, lies, and larceny have not diminished over the years.
And although some of you might have room
for yet another dessert
or patience for one more hilarious story,
I'm afraid I don't.
Earlier this week, the murder of three of my contractors
was ordered by someone in this room
to send a message that they believed
I was working with the F.B.I.
It was a vile, cowardly,
unforgivable act,
that quite frankly has resulted in very little impact on me
when compared to the devastating loss
felt by the children of those three dead women.
Now, given the publicity surrounding the assistance
I rendered to Special Agent Elizabeth Keen
during her recent stint as a fugitive,
I understand where one's suspicion may come from,
but it is unfounded.
And before this dinner is over,
I will not only prove that I have not betrayed us,
I will identify the person who has.
Save your breath, Reddington. Your grave's already been dug.
I'm sorry, but "Been dug"? Is that correct?
That doesn't sound correct, Marcus.
I think it's "Digged."
It is "Dug."
I'm fairly sure "Digged" is the archaic past tense.
I suppose they're both grammatically correct.
Sounds funny either way. I'm sorry. You were saying?
2 years ago, 20 of us broke bread at this table.
Now there are 12.
We have lost Hector Lorca,
Floriana Campo --
And others. What's your point, Marcus?
My name is Janet Macnamara.
I run the human intelligence unit at FBI headquarters.
We keep track of all the criminal informers
employed by the bureau.
Over the past two years,
our most valuable asset has been Raymond Reddington.
I thought we weren't supposed to have phones.
Okay, do we need to review? You have --
Four minutes.
Status?
Alpha teams have taken
the northeast corner on Benson Place.
Bravo's covered the hotel.
Charlie holds the south,
and Delta's waiting on my command.
90 seconds.
One spotter at the door. I'll take him on breach.
Has the target cleared the lobby?
Not yet.
75.
Okay, he's in the elevator.
You allege you have nothing to do with the demise
of our associates, and yet do you deny
that you have benefited from their misfortune?
No, I profited handsomely.
I didn't realize that was against the rules.
It's not, but we know you weren't
just working with Agent Keen while she was a fugitive.
Okay, transmitter's up.
Why am I not hearing anything?
Aram, is he in or not?
The only assistance I gave Agent Keen
was after she shot the Attorney General.
They were on tv always working together.
She was a fugitive, Dmitri.
I was paid a significant fee by certain unnamed parties
to aid in her escape.
It's what I do.
That is true, but we are not just
relying on the word of Janet Macnamara.
She provided us with access to documentation
confirming that in the last 28 months,
significant resources have been directed
to a top secret task force
dedicated to the apprehension of key figures
in the so-called criminal underworld
based on information provided by a single high-level informant.
You.
And that is a fact.
One you cannot deny.
Take your seat, Marcus. Your information is incorrect,
and you're standing in my light.
You know what your problem is? You talk too much.
That's not gonna be a problem anymore.
It appears we have a late arrival.
Okay, he's in.
How fortuitous. We were just talking about you.
You.
How the hell did you get in here?
Wait, is it me or -- - That sounds like Reddington.
This can't be good.
May I present to you Raymond Reddington?
Pour the man a glass of this wonderful port.
It appears this party's just getting started.
He lied to us. He knew that location the whole time.
Why? What's his angle?
I don't know, and I don't care,
but I'm calling that breach.
The minute you do, it'll prove Red's with us.
He'll be killed.
Reddington knows our protocol. If he's in there,
it's because he knew we'd find him.
He knows we're listening.
If he's willing to roll the dice,
we should be, too.
Raymond, what is this?
He's not Raymond Reddington.
He knew I called this meeting.
He knew that I was going to accuse him
of being an impostor, so he beat me here.
I told you that before this dinner was done,
I would prove my innocence
and identify the person who'd betrayed us.
Meet the fake Red. Faux Red. Fred.
Fred?
I took Agent Elizabeth Keen
on as a client when she was a fugitive to gain her trust
in exchange for information as to who was responsible
for decimating our ranks.
Like you, I'd heard the rumors
that I was the one who betrayed us.
And sure enough, after gaining her trust,
she confirmed that the bureau's confidential informant
was a Raymond Reddington.
I am so totally confused.
Is it possible they know each other?
If that's true, my head is definitely going to explode.
By the way, very clever, Marcus.
Abducting Janet Macnamara in your search for the truth.
But you and I both know the confession you coerced
from that poor woman you're holding
at Calabrese Fine Imports
was simply to confirm your lie.
You got that?
Yeah. Calabrese Fine Imports.
2119 Mcwhorther Street.
On my way. Dispatch tac teams.
I think we're gonna kill both of you.
You've been nipping at my heels ever since the incident
at that awful karaoke bar in Mombasa.
You're a liar.
I would very much like to hear what he has to say.
It's simple. Marcus hired him.
Hired?
To surrender himself to the F.B.I.,
pretending to be me
so he could use the feds to dismantle my business.
This is absurd.
Words, words, words. No proof.
You want proof?
The F.B.I. would never fly blind
into an operation like this.
He's wired.
You can go after a man's business, Marcus,
even his associates, but other than family,
the only thing off-limits is a man's reputation.
You have given false allegations against my good name,
which will be whispered and repeated
by those who envy my success
no matter how thoroughly I repudiate them.
"Repudiate them."
Words. That's all you ever had.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
I never wear cufflinks.
I lost the signal. Go! Breach! Now!
The F.B.I.
Actually, those belong to me.
Helicopters. They'll be escaping on the roof.
But I suspect the F.B.I. is on its way...
because of you.
So now we're all in a bit of a hurry.
Move!
I need you to put to rest
any question about who hired you.
Now.
It was Caligiuri.
You lying bastard!
He came to me, said he had a plan,
said he knew about Elizabeth Keen.
I'm gonna kill you.
You were right, Marcus.
I am the informant.
Tell all our friends in hell to be patient.
I'll be along soon enough.
Perhaps we should all get our hats and coats.
What about him?
Oh, yes. About him.
Fastest way to the roof is this express elevator.
We're not going up, Dmitri.
We're taking the service elevator down to the garage.
Then who are the choppers for?
Why aren't they landing?
The roof is clear. I repeat, the roof is clear.
The choppers were just a diversion.
Janet Macnamara.
Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
Hang in there. I'm gonna get you out of here, all right?
I know you've been through a terrible ordeal, Janet,
and I'm sorry for that.
But unfortunately your knowledge of my relationship
with the bureau is inherently dangerous
to you, your family, and to me.
So please listen carefully and follow my instructions
to the letter.
First thing tomorrow, you will inform your superiors
that the trauma of today's experience was such
that you have re-ordered your priorities
and wish to spend more time with Bob, Tyler, and the dogs.
You are going to move to Santa Monica, California.
I've purchased a beach house. The deed is in that envelope.
Your property taxes will be paid for on a biannual bases,
and I'll be checking on you from time to time
to make sure you're still safe.
Travel safely, Janet.
The sunset over the Pacific is magnificent.
What was his name?
Gregory Devry.
Were you close?
Gregory was a dear friend... and a brilliant grifter.
He made a good living conning con men.
Short of George Sanders,
I can think of no one I'd rather have pretend to be me.
But you killed him.
Gregory had terminal stomach cancer.
So at his request, I euthanized him.
You manufactured a doppelganger to reclaim your reputation.
I have many contingency plans in place. This was one.
Why not tell us?
The F.B.I. would never permit me to do the very thing necessary
to make the plan work.
Let everyone escape.
So they could spread the word that we're not working together.
Are we working together?
The way you were talking before, I wasn't so sure.
Tom?
No. The woman who turned me down for the apartment.
Elizabeth, this is Barbara Menninger.
Look, I wanted to apologize.
When I realized who you are, I just -- I overreacted.
Frankly, I thought you were a pretty terrible person,
and that was wrong.
You've been exonerated. You deserve a second chance,
and so I want you to know, the apartment's yours,
if you still want it.
♬Is it all that you need♬
♬To get back and feel good♬
♬Satisfied that you did what you could♬
♬It works itself out♬
♬Works itself out♬
Thank you...
for everything.
♬Just, is it time to take a look♬
You won't lose her, no matter what happens.
♬Bound by...♬
♬You put your thoughts into the shape of a weapon♬
♬All you did was learn a terrible lesson♬
You wanted to see me?
♬Sell me out♬
What is this place?
♬Again♬
You will not marry her.
Why?
Because I didn't ask daddy's permission?
Is that really why you called me here?
Or did you just want someone to play go fish?
You married her over my objection once.
It will not happen again.

Are you that woman? Elizabeth Keen?
No!
You're a traitor!
Ms. Keen. How you feeling?
Well, all things considered...
like crap.
Well, we, uh, we got back your M.R.I.s and, uh,
looks like you sustained three broken ribs.
No other internal injuries or bleeding.
There's really nothing much we can do about those ribs,
but just tough it out until they heal.
I've broken a few before.
Yeah, we noticed that. But hey, uh, good news.
The baby's fine.
It is?
The baby.
Yeah.
But you really uh... have to be more careful,
now that you're pregnant.
