what do you want me to say ? i didn &apos;t take the truck .
i checked his prints . they don &apos;t mathe ones on the steering wheel .
i saw the two of you kiss , after the party .
the only way to protect everyone is to separate you and a.j.
i &apos;m wondering why you felt the need
to take out a restraining order against your son .
that was expunged .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t make a recommendation on her adoption
until i investigate this further .
while i am , it &apos;s not appropriate for callie to be in your care .
you look amazing .
stop saying that . really , stop .
look , these earrings ... too much , right ?
yes ?
yeah , maybe something a little smaller .
yeah , smaller would be better .
whoops ? no .
oh , wait . try these here .
oh , jeez , i can &apos;t even believe i &apos;m going on this date
and leaving you here alone .
there &apos;s something really wrong with that .
i &apos;ll be fine , all right ? you &apos;re just nervous .
i &apos;m not nervous . i &apos;m terrified .
i haven &apos;t been on a date
since the bush administration , the first one .
&quot; don &apos;t go blowing something up that could be great
just because you &apos;re scared . &quot; you told me that .
did i say that ?
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna start listening to me .
all right , there . studs , yes ?
definitely studs .
fantastic .
okay , so , brandon , tomorrow the social worker
is going to interview you and callie separately .
what am i supposed to say ?
well , the truth ...
that after the restraining order you didn &apos;t see callie
until we brought her home from girls united .
and that you &apos;ve had a strictly brother @-@ and @-@ sister ,
platonic relationship ever since .
so then all of this will be over and callie can come home ?
and that idiot judge will let us adopt her ?
yeah , that &apos;s the plan .
a.j. , i spoke with your probation officer .
and he wants to meet with you tomorrow .
you told him i didn &apos;t steal any car , right ?
yeah , absolutely . i explained the whole mess .
it &apos;s just that mike has a foster care class
tomorrow all day , so i &apos;monna take you .
and what are doing about
finding that douchebag that sold us a stolen car ?
mariana .
i &apos;m gonna ask captain roberts
to put a robbery detective on the case .
really ?
no .
we &apos;re out , like , $ 1400 .
got what you deserved , if you ask me .
well , i didn &apos;t ask you .
and now you have to share your car with us , so you lose too .
even if we did catch the guy , you know , i seriously doubt
that you &apos;re ever gonna see a penny of that money again , love .
what , so he gets away with it ,
just like that guy with the hit @-@ and @-@ run that almost killed us ?
oh , but we didn &apos;t die , so i guess that &apos;s not a priority either .
your mom has worked very , very hard
try to find the person responsible for that , mariana .
unfortunately , justice is not always served in this world .
yeah , just ask callie .
okay , listen . i know that this is very upsetting for all of us ,
but this is simply a temporary setback .
callie &apos;s gonna be back hom very soon .
and for now , she &apos;s safe and sound at rita &apos;s , okay ?
who is it ?
it &apos;s chloe . is rita home ?
i &apos;m sorry , she &apos;s not here .
who are you ?
oh , i &apos;m callie . i &apos;m staying with rita .
but she went out .
when will she be back ?
i &apos;m not sure . she &apos;s kind of on a date .
a date ? really ?
well , that &apos;s not gonna last very long .
do you mind if i wait inside ?
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m her daughter .
oh . yeah , of course . come in .
well , that &apos;s new .
so how do you know my mother ?
um , i was in girls united for a little while .
oh , you &apos;re one of her lost girls ?
well , she &apos;s just fostering me for a few days
until my regular foster parents get their license renewed .
what happened to their license ?
did they do something wrong ?
no .
i kind of did .
drugs ?
no .
boys ?
a hottie like you ... i bet it was a boy , right ?
um , maybe i should call rita , let her know you &apos;re waiting .
i &apos;ll do it .
there .
forewarned .
you mind if i use the bathroom ?
thanks .
no , of course .
well , i guess she &apos;s not coming , so i &apos;m gonna go .
oh , okay . well , it was nice to meet you .
well , that was a bust .
hi , mom .
what are you doing here ?
just getting to know my new foster sister .
i &apos;m not gonna give you any money .
okay , first of all ,
i &apos;m not here to ask you to give me any money .
i &apos;m here to offer you an opportunity to invest .
it &apos;s a sure thing .
what is it this time ?
a food truck . the guy who owns it
is upside down and he needs cash fast .
i mean , he &apos;s practically giving it away .
and food trucks are all the rage right now .
i mean , these guys are making money hand over fist .
really ? so why is he selling it ?
because he mismanaged .
and you &apos;re gonna fix that ? you don &apos;t know anything
about the food business . you don &apos;t even cook .
why can &apos;t you ever believe in me ?
i have believed in you , chloe ,
to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars ,
all of which you wasted .
because you sabotage everything that i do .
are you off your medication ?
oh , here we go .
whenever i have any legitimate feelings ,
i must be off my meds .
you just want me checked out so i don &apos;t have to feel
the pain that you caused me .
okay , listen , i do not want to do this .
too bad i &apos;m not a juvenile delinquent .
you need to go now .
oh , wait . callie , was it ?
let me tell you something about my mother
saint rita , savior of lost souls ,
as long you aren &apos;t her own daughter .
thanks again for nothing , mom .
i just can &apos;t believe we &apos;re in the same boat with callie again .
i know she fine with rita ,
but i just can &apos;telp feeling like this is all our fault .
you mean my fault ?
what ? you told me not to get the restraininorder .
i had it expunged .
i never thought about paper copies
lingering in some social worker &apos;s file .
well , why would you ?
because i should have
i should have , lena .
it all gonna be all right .
so , honey , we need to schedule therapy for the week .
is friday okay for you ?
can we skip a week ?
we just ... we have so much going on .
we always have a lot going on .
okay , well , i cannot focus on us
until we get our daughter back . i &apos;m sorry .
okay , i &apos;ll let dr. melvoy know .
okay .
a restraining order , huh ?
what , were you , like , stalking her ?
no .
not at it &apos;s any of your business .
yo , what &apos;s your beef with me , huh ?
i came clean about talking to my brother ,
and taking your dumb baseball .
yeah , after i caught you . doesn &apos;change the fact that you lied .
oh , you never lie ?
you never took something that wasn &apos;t yours ?
you &apos;re not even gonna try to get along with him ?
he &apos;s not gonna be here much longer .
no , then he &apos;s gonna move in with mike
and be your foster brother .
look , i don &apos;t need him giving me the third degree about callie .
feel bad enough as it is .
you are over her , right ?
yes .
you &apos;re sure ?
yes .
look , i already had my chance to get back with her .
i said no .
wait , when was this ?
uh , when robert said
he wasn &apos;t gonna sign the papers ,
callie was freaking out and ...
well , you two better get your stories straight .
if the social worker finds out about this ,
we &apos;ll really lose her for good .
well , doesn &apos;t look like she took anything .
i &apos;m so sorry . i had no idea ...
how could you have known ?
i would have told you , but i didn &apos;t know she was talking to me .
so she takes things ?
yeah .
she doesn &apos;t consider it stealing .
she feels she &apos;s entitled because i was such a horrible mother .
she did look through your mail .
what ?
yep , a check &apos;s missing .
i never saw her touch your checkbook .
well , she &apos;s pretty tricky at that .
i mean , don &apos;t worry about it .
it &apos;s not the first time i &apos;ve had to cancel a check that chloe stole .
you said she &apos;s ... she &apos;s on meds ?
yeah , she &apos;s bipolar , axis i.
she &apos;s already difficult ,
but when she &apos;s off her medication ,
she &apos;s even more paranoid and irrational .
must be hard .
it is ,
for both of us .
hey , so now that callie &apos;s at rita &apos;s ,
where &apos;s a.j. gonna go until dad gets his license ?
uh , well ,
mama and i are just ...
we &apos;re gonna get our license renewed .
why ? you &apos;re not gonna foster any more kids , are you ?
no , no , no , no . it &apos;s just in case
callie &apos;s adoption gets delayed ,
to make sure that we can keep fostering her .
didn &apos;t you renew your license
last time callie was taken out of the house ?
uh , no , no , no .
that was ... that was just an extension .
so a.j. &apos; s not leaving then ?
i &apos;m just asking .
b , i know that you have your issues with a.j. ,
but you have had it just a little bit easier than he has ,
so please don &apos;t be this way .
so there weren &apos;t , like , any cameras at this intersection ?
isn &apos;t that kind of weird ?
yeah , these days . but what &apos;s really weird
is that there were cameras around there
that should have caught the driver trying to get away .
well , maybe he didn &apos;t try to get away .
what do you mean ?
well , maybe he hid somewhere
or waited till dark or for someone to come pick him up .
that &apos;s actually a really good theory .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to be a cop ?
good nigh mom .
good night , love .
i was feeling pretty good about myself , you know .
i had the tool belt on and knew exactly what i was doing .
i &apos;m was even videoing the whole thing with my cell phone , right ?
yeah , that i &apos;d like to see .
the next thing i know , the pipe bursts
and water &apos;s just ...
oh , no . what did you do ?
cried like a baby .
just sitting there on the floor , in a puddle , sobbing .
never fear . shaz is here .
and i promise i will treat your pipes with gentle , loving care .
well , thank you .
i hope you &apos;re not getting in shaz &apos;s way .
oh , no , not at all .
no , i don &apos;t mind the company .
stef , you need to get dressed and get to work .
oh my gosh , i &apos;d better get out of here .
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
she seems great , huh ?
so what &apos;s it like living with rita ?
i bet her place like is messy .
i hope you &apos;ve got your own room and a lock on the door .
no , rita went on a date with a guy .
you &apos;re the only lesbian here , private cruz .
private ?
yeah , i got my g.e.d. and i join the army in two weeks .
congratulation carmen .
that &apos;s been your goal for , like , so long .
yeah , rita helped me get a waiver ,
since , you know , i have a record .
all i gotta do now is pass the physical ,
and i start basic training .
good luck , girl . you think this place is strict .
yeah , but in the army i get to shoot an m32 grenade launcher .
ooh , maybe i should join the army ,
get one of those hot navy seals .
yeah , you &apos;ll last all of five minutes in basic training .
shut your pie hole .
so what if this social worker finds out
you &apos;ve been seeing brandon the whole time you were at g.u. ?
she won &apos;t .
brandon better not tell her about the last time .
what last time ?
thanks , kiara . thank you .
oh , sorry .
i kissed brandon at the g.u. fundraiser ,
but only because robert told me
that he wasn &apos;t gonna let me get adopted ,
and i thought ...
i was giving up brandon for nothing .
but he &apos;s told me that he &apos;s over it , so ...
are you over him ?
yeah , totally .
because she &apos;s got a new foster brother .
and he is fine .
stop it . it &apos;s not like that .
yeah .
not like what ?
huh @-@ uh , no . you gotta go do touch @-@ ups .
those dishes have been sitting in the sink since the morning .
they &apos;re not mine . and i &apos;m not cleaning up after some stanky slobs .
they are too yours .
and you &apos;re the stank .
hey , watch the way you speak to one another .
she &apos;s mouthing off again .
so ?
give her an unacceptable and walk away .
brooke , carmen is house foreman . she is in charge .
she ain &apos;t in charge of me .
th attitude is the reason why you have no privileges .
she &apos;s the one with the attitude .
really ?
she is a girl who came here
and who worked this program and made her dreams come true .
now you can get up
and get into the kitchen and do your chores ,
or you can get your butt kicked out of here .
okay , ladies , this is not a coffee klatch , okay ?
please , homework . thank you very much .
callie , we leave here in a few .
yeah
what crawled up her ass ?
she &apos;s acting hella crazy .
so what are we doing here ?
well , the driver ... the driver of the hit @-@ and @-@ run ...
the only way he could have left the scene
was down this alley ,
because none of the security cameras caught him on tape .
so brandon had the idea that maybe
he hid in this alley until the coast was clear .
was it hard on brandon ...
you bringing home all these kids ?
uh , well , he was young
when the twins came to live with us .
and i think he enjoyed not being the only child anymore .
and he &apos;s been great with callie and jude
for the most part .
maybe he hid in the dumpster ...
the driver .
or maybe went up the fire escape .
or maybe he got on a bus .
so , as you know ,
i asked to speak to both you and callie .
this isn &apos;t an interrogation .
i just wanted to here from your point of view ,
what transpired between you two .
um , okay . well ... i think we ...
sorry , just talk about yourself .
oh , okay .
um , well , i ... i ...
my feelings just sort of developed
gradually , i guess .
and i thought she and jude were only gonna be with us temporarily .
but you knew foster siblings aren &apos;t allowed
to engage in any sort of romantic relationship .
yes .
and we ...
i tried my best not to act on anything .
and we never ...
but you kissed .
yes , once .
when was that ?
um , at my moms &apos; wedding .
why ?
why did we kiss ?
why then ? did something happen ?
no .
they asked if they could adopt us .
and what did you say ?
we said yes .
and this was before or after you kissed brandon ?
after , definitely .
before . it was that morning .
i ... i was trying
to blow it up , i guess .
i didn &apos;t feel like i deserved to be adopted .
and who initiated the kiss ?
i did .
it was me , definitely .
to mess things up before they got messed up ?
yeah .
so your feelings for brandon weren &apos;t genuine ?
no , they were .
would you say you were in love ?
i guess . yes .
and now ?
i love her .
i love him .
as a sister .
as a brother .
and your foster moms had no idea ?
no . that &apos;s why they sent me
to girls united when they found out .
they never would have let us live under the same roof
if they &apos;d thought anything was going on between us .
okay , i just have one more question for you , brandon .
did you everiolate the restraining order ?
what ?
did you ever see callie secretly , when she was at girls united ?
uh , no .
okay then . thank you , for talking to me .
can i ask you thank you a question ?
sure .
um , my moms were just worried
their foster license may expire
before callis adoption comes through .
so they were wondering
if they needed to renewed it , just in case .
on , no , they &apos;re fine .
their license is good for another two years .
okay , great .
i will let them know .
i remember a young man ,
african @-@ american , got on the bus ,
blood all over his shirt and face .
he was real jumpy .
there was blood ?
oh , yeah .
&apos;cause i had to clean it
off his seat before i started my next run .
okay , do you happen to remember which stop it was that he got off ?
i think so .
pretty sure i let him off on frontera ,
right in front of that big pharmacy .
so right now there are three user interfaces
so one is like a search engine
for foster kids to find out where to get the stuff they need .
and the second is where kids can find
family and friends that , you know , they &apos;ve lost contact with .
and tell them what you &apos;re calling it .
it &apos;s called &quot; fost and found . &quot;
&quot; fost and found ? &quot;
i think it &apos;s clever .
yeah .
that &apos;s cool .
and then there &apos;s gonna be a story corps interface
where basically kids can upload audio
and videos of themselves telling their stories about the system .
what kind of stories ?
anything .
but , i mean , the idea is
to call out social workers that aren &apos;t doing their jobs ,
unfit foster families ,
the judges that keep rulingrs that against adoptions .
what about sketchy group homes
where they force you to do slave labor ?
by all means , brooke , alert the media
to the horrors here at girls united .
okay , well , maybe not this one ,
but there are some really nasty group homes out there .
what are you doing it for ?
it &apos;s for school credit ,
but also it &apos;s so that foster kids
can have a voice and be heard .
well , it &apos;s not like we can use it .
they don &apos;t let us use the internet .
yes , but you &apos;re not gonna be here forever . right , dee ?
so i was hoping
maybe i could record some of your stories
and upload them for you .
daphne , you could talk about how hard it &apos;s been
for you to get visitations with tasha .
yeah , but i don &apos;t want to mess up my chances of getting her back .
my probation hearing &apos;s coming up .
we can &apos;t risk making things harder for ourselves .
and you &apos;re so close to getting adopted ,
you can &apos;t go around kicking the hornet &apos;s nest either .
what do you think ?
well , most of the people i know working in the system
do care , you know .
and they try their best to do their jobs .
yeah .
and there are abuses .
someone needs to call them out on it .
but it &apos;s a lot to ask of kids who could suffer the consequences .
maybe you need to find some kids that have less lose .
it &apos;s so great to work for clients i like for a change .
that &apos;s nice of you to say that .
well , it &apos;s true , i mean ,
you &apos;ve got a beautiful home ,
a beautiful family . and your partner stef ...
what a great gal , huh ?
yeah , yeah , i really lucked out in the wife department .
yeah , you really did.i mean ,
they don &apos;t make broads like that anymore , you know ?
like , really strong but feminine ...
i bet she looks hot in her uniform .
oh , hey there .
how &apos;s it going ?
good , good .
okay .
there you go . we &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
yeah , okay . all right .
have a good one .
yeah .
where did you find her ?
what ?
hey , b.
hey , honey .
how did ...
how did the interview go with the social worker , b.
fine .
just fine ?
what did she say ? what did she ask ?
she asked me
if i was still in love with callie .
okay , and what did you say .
i told her that i &apos;m not the foster brother that she has to worry about .
what is that mean ?
you tell me .
i know you that your foster license didn &apos;t expire .
and since a.j. is only living here now that callie &apos;not ...
that can only mean one thing , right ?
so is that it ?
is callie hooking up with a.j. now ?
uh , the night of her birthday party ...
i saw a.j. and callie kiss .
so are you gonna get a restraining order against him ?
it &apos;s a very different situation , brandon .
a.j. is not gonna be callie &apos;s brother .
if it &apos;s so different , then why did you lie ?
why didn &apos;t you just tell us that a.j.
has to live somewhere else ?
because we didn &apos;t want to embarrass them .
but you didn &apos;t mind humiliating me ?
it &apos;s not the same thing .
stop saying that , mom .
it is the same .
the only difference is , good old brandon
has to take it on the chin .
every time you bring stray kid into this house
without even asking me how i feel about it .
luckily , i &apos;m out of here a year anyway .
and you can adopt all the kids you want ,
turn this place into a group home for all i care ,
because it &apos;s obvious you guys do not want to live along together .
excuse me ?
what , you don &apos;t think we can &apos;t hear you bickering all the time ?
we know you &apos;re in therapy
so maybe you guys should just worry about your own relationship for once .
you cancelled the check ?
the one you stole from me ?
you bet i did .
i &apos;m your daughter , mom . do you even care i starve to death ?
yes , chloe , i do care . i care very much .
but i &apos;m not going to continue to enable you .
enable ? is that your excuse for being bad mother ?
i know . i know that &apos;s the way you feel , chloe .
you &apos;ve said it to me a million times .
no , mom .
it &apos;s not the way that feel . it &apos;s the truth .
i &apos;m not gonna talk to you when you &apos;re acting like this .
i hate you .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
and daddy hated you , too .
because you made him miserable .
and that &apos;s why he killed himself .
don &apos;you ever lay your hands on me again .
i &apos;m sorry to let you see that .
you know , i &apos;ve been punched .
i &apos;ve been kicked , i &apos;ve been spit on by girls before .
and i always managed to keep it together .
but you know , my own daughter .
you don &apos;t have to explain .
yeah , i do . okay ?
i mean , she took the divorce very hard .
and maybe , it was my fault .
you know i &apos;ve always , always been married to my work .
but i didn &apos;t realize how depressed he had gotten .
chloe is the one who found him .
yeah , i tried to pull her closer ,
but she blamed me .
and i felt guilty .
so every time she asked for money ,
i just wrote her a check .
basically i broke every rule that we try to teach you at g.u.
and now ...
now i &apos;m finally drawing boundaries
she thinks i &apos;m cruel and heartless .
she is right about one thing ...
i am a terrible mother for letting it get to this point .
no , you are not a terrible mother , okay ?
she said some really horrible things to you .
and it &apos;s not like when the g.u. girls lash out .
she &apos;s your daughter . of course it hurts .
i think i need to take some time off from girls united .
can you ?
no .
hey , man , what &apos;s up ?
i ha a big math test tomorrow .
oh , yeah ?
well , i &apos;actually pretty good at math , so if you want some help ...
can you just shut up so i can study , please ?
sure .
okay .
i just got a text on brandon .
he &apos;s gonna stay in idyllwild tonight .
good .
give him time to cool down .
what &apos;s that ?
the video surveillance from the pharmacy .
that was fast .
everything &apos;s on computer these days .
all you need is an access code .
it &apos;s amazing anyone gets away with anything now ,
with all the cameras everywhere .
my hunch is that the driver came in
to get bandages or some stuff for first aid .
i &apos;m hoping to get a visual i.d.
does it bother you that the kid know we &apos;re having problems ?
we &apos;re not having problems .
it &apos;s good for them to see that couples fight .
they &apos;re fine . we &apos;re fine .
you want to go to the beach later ?
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t think i can .
oh , okay . well , we don &apos;t have to go to the beach .
we can do something else .
all right . everyone , take your seats .
turn over your papers and begin .
jude , excuse me ?
30 minutes . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s gonna be enough time .
uh , sorry .
jude , jude , what are you doing ?
why aren &apos;t you taking your math test ?
i don &apos;t feel like it .
well , i &apos;m sorry you don &apos;t feel like it ,
but you have to take the test , or you &apos;ll fail .
i don &apos;t care if i fail .
well , you should .
why ?
why should i care about some stupid math test
when callie &apos;s back in the system
and you and mom are getting a divorce ?
why should i care about anything ?
jude . jude .
you know he &apos;s just acting out .
he &apos;s a teenager .
for the record , stef and i are not getting a divorce .
we &apos;re just going through a little rough patch .
we started couples counseling . except now stef doesn &apos;t want to go .
with five kids ... sorry , make that six ...
it &apos;s hard to make us a priority .
well , if you don &apos;t , you risk waking up one day
and realizing there &apos;s no &quot; us &quot; left .
i know . i just don &apos;t know how to get stef to see that .
don &apos;t divorce off the table .
what i mean is , sometimes people think
they can neglect the relationship
because &quot; we &apos;re married with kids , we &apos;re never breaking up . &quot;
but it &apos;s not okay to be unhappy .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m not happy and i need to tell her .
can i talk to callie ?
cal .
what are you doing here ?
i messed up really bad .
i walked out of my math test .
i just got up and left .
then i yelled at lena .
i don &apos;t want to go home .
why not ?
are you afraid or something ,
&apos;cause you yelled ?
jude , i &apos;ve put them through way worse .
what do you think they &apos;re gonna do to me ?
every kid says mean things to their parents , jude .
not kids like us .
you can &apos;t be afraid to speak up ,
or mess up even .
i mean , i get it . we &apos;re all the same ...
every foster kid .
we think we &apos;re not allowed
to say what we need or to stand up for ourselves .
but we have to , okay ? and that includes you .
could i say something ?
jude , you know ,
parent an &apos;t love you more
because you &apos;re biologically theirs .
i mean , you moms ... they don &apos;t love you
because you &apos;re easy to deal with
or because you keep your mouth shut .
they love you because you &apos;re you .
our moms are splitting up .
why would you say that ?
i overheard them and brandon fighting .
he said they were having problems and going to couples therapy .
that doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re goona split up though .
i mean , is that what they were fighting about ?
no , they were fighting about you and a.j.
so what um ... what did they say to brandon ?
that they caught you kissing .
why do you keep doing this ?
hey , i am so sorry i yelled you .
do you think i can retake my math test ?
apology accepted ,
but that will be up to your teacher , love .
we &apos;re just glad that you &apos;re okay , sweetheart .
we love you .
i love you , too .
hey , what ... ?
you didn &apos;t answer any of my texts .
sorry .
excuse me . i have to take this .
are you sure you &apos;re okay ? really ?
&apos;cause we were worried , you know ?
yeah .
what &apos;s going on ?
jude had a rough day .
sorry to hear about that , buddy .
callie , there &apos;s a situation at girls united .
i &apos;m sorry , we have to go .
bye .
that was very sweet ... what you said to jude .
you know , i know you haven &apos;t exactly had the best day yourself .
and seeing you be so kind and thoughtful
it has made me realize that
i think i have more compassion for my adopted kids than i do for you .
i just ... i think um ...
in my mind you haven &apos;t sufferd as much as they have .
you &apos;ve had a stable home ,
and parents that have loved you
and cared for you from the day you were born .
and that &apos;s um ... that &apos;s not fair . it &apos;s not fair .
i know you &apos;ve suffered . i know you &apos;ve hurt .
and i know that things aren &apos;t just great
just because you have us .
we weren &apos;t there for you about callie .
i see now that your heart was broken .
and i should have been there .
i should have been more understanding .
i just always expect you to do the right thing .
because you just ... you always do , b.
and i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;ve always been so warm and welcoming
to all the kids that we &apos;ve brought in this house .
it just never occurred to me that you might not actually be okay .
if you don &apos;t want your father to foster a.j. ,
i think you need to say something .
you have that right .
and i &apos;ll support you .
thank you .
thank you .
i love you , mom .
i love you .
carmen and brooke have been at each other &apos;s throats all day .
i sent them up to their rooms .
are you kidding me ?
damn it . keep the girls down here .
okay , that &apos;s enough . brooke , downstairs now .
carmen stop !
i said enough ! i mean that carmen .
get out of my face , bitch !
oh my god .
michelle , take carmen and get some ice .
brooke , get to your room right now .
we &apos;re gonna have to call the police .
can we call stef ?
yeah .
so what happened ?
brooke and me were in a fight .
and rita came upstairs .
and ?
and she tried to break it up .
and then she hit me .
brooke ?
no . rita .
i never laid a hand on her .
it &apos;s true . rita punched her in the face .
i know what you must be thinking .
i &apos;m not .
i did not hit carmen .
i know that .
ma &apos;am , we have to cuff you .
is that really necessary ?
yes , callie . it &apos;s the law .
i &apos;m gonna take brooke down to the station , get her statement .
and i &apos;ll bring carmen as soon as i take her to the e.r. to get checked out .
callie , go get your stuff .
no , i &apos;m staying here .
what ? no , no , you &apos;re not staying here .
well , obviously , i can &apos;t stay at rita &apos;s , and i &apos;d rather stay here .
hey , given what just happened , there is no way ...
kiara and daphne have my back .
the last time i was put in a random foster home ,
the woman locked me in a room .
fine . i will call your social worker .
you keep your cell phone on you .
you do not let anyone know that you have it .
and at the first sign of trouble , you call me , yes ?
yeah .
oh , i didn &apos;t even hear you come home .
hey .
how did it go ?
the girls are sticking to their story that rita hit carmen .
rita was released for the night ,
but looks like she &apos;ll be charged with assault .
i don &apos;t believe it . they have to be lying .
i don &apos;t know . rita &apos;s under a lot of pressure .
can &apos;t be easy dealing with those girls .
i just ... i think sometimes people lose their tempers and snap .
no , i don &apos;t think that rita &apos;s even capable of that . do you ?
i ... i think we &apos;re all capable of doing things that we never thought we &apos;d do .
think you &apos;re looking for a needle in a haystack there ?
maybe .
but maybe not .
that &apos;s joe olsen ...
the son of the owner of the s.u.v. that hit the kids .
are you sure ?
yeah , i interviewed him .
well , i thought they said they reported the car stolen .
yeah , the day after the accident .
i never bought that . okay .
they didt find his fingerprints in the car though .
but didn &apos;t you say the guy on the bus was black ?
yeah , but this joe olsen
shows up in this pharmacy 40 minutes after the accident ?
i &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s not coincidence .
i wanted to take this opportunity tell you my story .
callie ?
so my little brother and i
have been in seven different foster homes .
and in one home i was raped
by an older foster brother ,
liam olmstead .
and then there was this other home
and we had this foster dad ... jim pearson .
and one day he was beating my little brother so bad ,
i had to take a baseball bat to his car
to get him to stop .
nothing happened to him . i went to juvie .
after that , i ended up in a safe ,
loving foster home .
and my foster moms adopted my little brother ,
but the judge wouldn &apos;t allow them to adopt me .
and the same judge ,
judge jeffrey ringer ,
continues to block my adoption whitout considering what i want .
and that is what is wrong with the system .
we foster kids have no control over our own lives ,
and it is time that we speak up
and we starting calling people out by name .
that is the only way that things will change .
and we cannot be afraid .
and that is why i &apos;m telling my story
and i ... i ...
i really hope that you &apos;ll tell yours .
what is this ?
callie ask me to upload to her web app .
should she be saying those things ?
i don &apos;t think you should post it .
it &apos;s too late . and ok , she already got , like , 30 views .
