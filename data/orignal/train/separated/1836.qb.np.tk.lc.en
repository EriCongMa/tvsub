psychologists believe
that every aspect of our lives ,
all our thought processes and behavior patterns ,
are the direct result of our relationship to our parents ...
well , you &apos;re looking all thoughtful .
i was just thinking how pretty you are ...
and also how pretty our children would be .
children ?
like , multiple ?
child . let &apos;s just start with one and see how that goes .
you wanna start ?
i &apos;m just saying , you &apos;re pretty .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
that every relationship that we have
is really just another version of that first relationship .
have you talked to dr. wyatt ?
cristina ...
when &apos;s the last time you ...
it &apos;s just us trying over and over again
to get it right .
alex .

and cristina &apos;s not answering her phone ,
and i have a thing .
so i need you to be a girl for me .
what &apos;d he do ? you want me to kick his ass ?
he wants me to have a baby .
so you do want me to kick his ass .
alex .
do you want to have a baby ?
a baby doesn &apos;t want me .
i had the worst mother in the world .
i would be the worst mother in the world .
izzie wants a divorce . she sent the papers--
the official papers .
want me to kick her ass ?
hey , alex .
he &apos;s being a girl for me .
dude , it &apos;s true .
right .
well , there &apos;s a guy downstairs says he &apos;s your brother .

since this seems to be where you receive your visitors ?
uh , tell him to wait .
right .
you have a brother ?
yeah .
do you want me to go get rid of him ?
crap . what &apos;s he doing here ?
alex is the oldest , then me and then amber .
amber &apos;s graduating from st. savior &apos;s in may .
she &apos;s ... she &apos;s smart , like alex .
she could go to college if she wanted to ,
but she &apos;s like , &quot; what &apos;s the point ? &quot; you know ?
and i don &apos;t know what to tell her .
alex is the doctor in the family .
i just move people for a living .
hey . what are you doing here ?
man . you got old . hey .
dude , uh , what are you doing here ?

为人父母
thank you .
cappuccino .
cappuccino .
so ... how &apos;d the date go with teddy ?
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d call it a date .
doesn &apos;t going on a date imply actually going somewhere ?
oh , shut up . you had sex ?
hey , guys .
hey .
oh ! pound cake .
i love pound cake ...
thank you .
rich , buttery pound cake .
yum . pound cake .
pound cake ?
oh , i &apos;m good . thanks .
so what exactly constitutes a pound cake ?
it &apos;s a yellow cake ...
there you go .
kinda heavy .
come on . code for something dirty , right ?
like &quot; you eat her pound cake . she eats your pound cake &quot; ?
no .
oh , please , tell me it &apos;s dirty ,
because otherwise , that was the most boring conversation
i &apos;ve ever been a part of .
we are talking about pound cake
because i want a kid , and she doesn &apos;t ,
and we &apos;re not talking about that .
how long are you two not gonna have that conversation--
a year , two years , five ?
wow . so ... you and teddy ate pound cake together .
you &apos;re changing the subject .
you like how i did that ?
so how was it ?
mind @-@ blowing .
yeah ?
i pounded her cake . she pounded mine .
good .
excellent pound caking .
&quot; pound caking &quot; is not a thing .
whatever . i blew her mind .
life @-@ changing ?
life @-@ changing , earth @-@ shattering .
the point is , he &apos;s a legend for a reason .
i mean , he has skills that i never even knew existed .
it was like there was a @-@ a party going on .
a party in your panties .
morning .
good morning .
hi .
okay , bye .
bye .
see ya .
he &apos;s always so grumpy .
he &apos;s going through something , and cristina doesn &apos;t get it .
she can &apos;t , which isn &apos;t her fault ,
but i do get it , and ... and i can &apos;t be there for him ,
and that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s really hard .
but you &apos;re seeing mark .
but i &apos;m seeing mark .
so then a couple days ago , we &apos;re at the grocery store ,
gary and i , and the next thing i know ,
i &apos;m flat on my back in the frozen foods section .
she fainted .
and i &apos;ve never fainted .
i never seen anybody faint .
i don &apos;t believe in fainting .
did you hit your head ?
i would &apos;ve if this one hadn &apos;t caught me .
mrs. clark is anemic and guaiac positive ,
so there &apos;s definitely some internal bleeding ,
which looks like it &apos;s coming from a--
friable tumor near the ampulla of vater .
yes , thank you for that , dr. kepner .
dr. swender told us the biopsy showed the cancer was back .
but she said you might be able to take it out .
there &apos;s a chance i won &apos;t be able
to go in as deeply as i &apos;ll need to ,
but i promise to do everything i can .
anything you could do .
we appreciate it , dr. webber .
thank you .
thank you .
i honestly don &apos;t think i need surgery .
you do .
you do .
it doesn &apos;t even hurt that bad .
you have an umbilical hernia . you need surgery .
so shut up and fill out the paperwork .
i think surgery &apos;s just gonna make it hurt worse .
you remember when dad had his gall bladder out ?
stop talking and write .
write what ? i don &apos;t have insurance . okay ?
what am i supposed to write ?
ask bailey to do it pro bono .
i can &apos;t ask her to do that .
alex , he &apos;s your brother .
evil spawn has a brother ?
ah . aaron , cristina yang .
it &apos;s nice to meet you , dr. yang . i &apos;m aaron karev .
oh , my god . you &apos;re so nice . he &apos;s so ni--
why can &apos;t you be nice like your brother
be nice
angelspawn ?
why can &apos;t you ?
fair enough .
uh , mer , what &apos;s up ? you called ?
ten times .
oh , well ... owen &apos;s still in his dark place ,
and he &apos;s still not talking , so i turned off my cell
in case he would say something , which he didn &apos;t .
i hate men . they &apos;re stupid .
derek asked me to have a baby with him this morning .
really stupid .
oh ! great . the pit , with owen and his dark place .
what have we got ?
cop with multiple g.s.w.s.
how many cops did you say ?
just one .
officer gina thompson , 34 , g.s.w.s to the hip and chest .
vitals--100 over 70 , pulse 118 , respiration &apos;s 28 .
that &apos;s quite a police escort there , officer thompson .
i told those guys i was gonna be fine .
well , yeah . i wonder why they didn &apos;t believe you .
i been in worse shape .
seriously ?
oh , yeah . you should see the other guys .
you took down three guys by yourself ?
hey , a girl &apos;s gotta do what a girl &apos;s gotta do .
am i right , ladies ?
let &apos;s go .
how many bullet wounds ?
four , but i &apos;m wondering if--
no exit wound for the right leg . probably busted the femur .
i have to get in there and debride . and trajectory seems--
seems to have gone upwards . breath sounds are
all right , three chest wounds
can &apos;t be transthoracic
oh , god , gina , baby .
baby , look at you .
i &apos;m okay , baby .
they &apos;re taking really good care of me .
this is my husband , jimmy . that &apos;s lieutenant moore .
so what &apos;d you find out at the scene ?
you were told to wait for backup .
well , i was first on the scene . i heard a shot .
i went in .
you disobeyed a direct order .
you endangered your own life and
everybody in the building .
i took down three men by myself .
and you got yourself suspended for it .
what ? !
it &apos;s going to the review board this afternoon .
you &apos;ll be lucky to have a job by the end of the day .
no , i gotta get outta here . i gotta go defend myself .
i need you to take a deep breath .
breath sounds are decreasing . she &apos;s bleeding into her chest .
all right , throw in the chest tube now !
get them outta here now !
no , i gotta go . please !
all right , gina , just lie back .
take a deep breath . all you have to do is breathe .
dr. webber , did you consider
doing a whipple on mrs. clark ?
i did , but since the cancer came back ,
i think i can do a local resection
and get the entire visible tumor .
dr. kepner , are we boring you ?
no , sir . i just--i wasn &apos;t expecting chief shepherd
to be up in the gallery during a general surgery .
but i guess that &apos;s the chief &apos;s job , right--
evaluating , observing ?
dr. kepner , you &apos;re in my o.r. ,
and the only one observing and evaluating you right now
is me .
yes , sir . i &apos;m sorry , sir .
with the orange or the red ?
how &apos;s that ? orange and the red . you think it &apos;s gonna work ?
dr. bailey , you got a second ?
i do . i have a second .
which is why i &apos;m spending it with my child .
here , look . say &quot; bye @-@ bye , dr. karev . &quot;
see him ? bye @-@ bye .
say bye .
dr. bailey ...
my little brother is here ,
with what looks like a , uh , umbilical hernia .
i didn &apos;t know dr. karev had a little brother .
did you know dr. karev had a little brother ?
he has no money . he doesn &apos;t have insurance , so--
ah , mommy sees where this is going .
he--he &apos;d have to have you perform the surgery pro bono .
ah ! did you hear that funny word ?
pro bono ?
mommy &apos;s got a mountain of surgeries to schedule .
does she have time to do free surgeries ?
and i &apos;ll schedule your surgeries ...
for the next ... week if you want .
you think mommy should fix up dr. karev &apos;s brother ...
and make him feel all better ?
two weeks . a month .
well , all right .
i will meet dr. karev &apos;s brother in , what , half an hour .
say &quot; bye @-@ bye , dr. karev . &quot; bye @-@ bye .
i woulda done it anyway ,
but he just kept talking , didn &apos;t he ?
you &apos;re so good .
mr. clark .
how is she ?
she did great in there .
she was a total trouper . the surgery went great .
we got the tumor--all of it-- with good margins .
oh , thank god . ohh .
dr. grey , thank you . thank you so much .
my wife keeps telling me ...
i need to be more manly about all this .
i mean , after all , she &apos;s the one with the cancer .
she &apos;s afraid i &apos;m the one who won &apos;t make it .
i think you &apos;re doing just fine .
you both are . would you like to see her ?
can i ?
she should be waking up any minute .
how is it your brother is a surgeon
and you waited months to take care of this ?
i don &apos;t know . karevs are tough .
i guess five years in foster care
will do that to you .
foster care ?
you &apos;re all foster children ?
well , me and amber were in and out ,
but alex , he had like ...
17 different foster homes in 5 years .
so alex was a foster child ?
yeah , because my mom was , you know , and it was before
they had all the meds that they have today ,
and she was--i guess she was doing her best .
but my dad , he ... wasn &apos;t a good guy ,
and he was ... you know ...
whatever .
and so alex , he got shipped around a lot .
and ... he was a pretty rough kid
if you didn &apos;t know him ,
so people didn &apos;t like to keep him .
then he ended up in juvie .
j @-@ j @-@ juvenile detention ?
yeah , &apos; cause my mom , she--
sometimes she &apos;d forget to ... buy food , so ...
he was good , though .
people wouldn &apos;t have even known he was stealing anything
if it hadn &apos;t been for the video cameras .
how old was he ?
mm , 11 , maybe 12 .
hey , what are we doing with 28 @-@ 07 ?
dude , are you talking crap in here ?
no .
dude , i work here .
so go to work . uh , check the chest tube in 28 @-@ 07 . go .
shut it , aaron .
so what happened after juvie ?
dr. bailey , i don &apos;t think that alex--
mind your business . aaron , after juvie ?
you couldn &apos;t expect me to just sit there
with a 10 @-@ 71 in progress .
i had good , solid information
the perps were threatening a ...
baby , baby , your doctors are here .
uh , we need to take you to surgery .
kenny , did you get that ? it was a 10 @-@ 71 .
baby , he got that , okay ? but you gotta go with them .
wait ! look , this is important , okay ?
they &apos;re gonna need a statement .
baby , that &apos;s what &apos;s important , trying to save your job ?
jimmy--
listen , every year , you promise me that once you make detective ,
we &apos;re gonna ... buy a house , have a kid and settle down .
but ... baby , it &apos;s been seven years .
and every time you get close to a promotion ,
you go do something stupid .
baby--
and now these people are trying to save your life ,
and you want &apos; em to wait .
i &apos;m not gonna stand here and watch you die .
i want a life with you , baby .
i want a long ...
happy , boring life .
tell me everything you did .
i was trying to wean her off the ventilator ,
but then i realized that she wasn &apos;t breathing on her own .
so i put her back on her previous vent settings .
wh--dr . webber , what &apos;s happening to her ?
she may have stroked out .
get a c.t. and get the scans to shepherd
and also run an e.e.g.
we need to find out right away if there &apos;s any brain activity .
if there &apos;s not , then we need--
she--she looks great .
oh , thank god .
dr. grey told me you got the tumor .
thank you so much , dr. webber .
can i wake her ?
sweetheart ?
you still sleeping ?
the doctors said you did great in there .
honey ?
you awake ?
alison ?
alison ?
the patient has mass hemorrhage .
look , see here .
the left hemorrhage lobe hemorrhage , it &apos;s-- it looks like it--
wow . that bleed is huge .
what ?
you look even prettier in your scrubs .
what are you gonna do about your giant stroke ?
nothing .
nothing ?
yeah . mrs. clark has a left temporal lobe hemorrhage
that &apos;s extended into the ventricular system .
there &apos;s nothing we can do . want to get a cup of coffee ?
only if you keep telling me how pretty i am ?
i &apos;ve got three bowel injuries here .
you got anything , avery ?
i found what did the damage .
you see the bullet ?
lodged near the liver .
teddy , i &apos;m looking at a devastator .
what ? what does that mean ?
it means be careful . they &apos;re sharp like shrapnel
and they explode on impact .
can you imagine going to work every day
knowing you &apos;re gonna end up on the wrong side of a gun ?
i know . she is awesome .
and now her husband wants her to give it all up ?
he &apos;s all like , &quot; let &apos;s start popping out babies
or i &apos;m leaving you &quot; ?
why does it have to be one or the other ?
because you don &apos;t have kids
if you &apos;re facing mortar fire every day ,
it screws with your head .
is that why you don &apos;t have &apos; em--iraq ?
well , first it was residency , and then it was iraq ,
and now it &apos;s , i don &apos;t know , waiting for the right guy ?
you want to have kids ?
wait . you don &apos;t ?
are you mad at me ? no .
okay , we &apos;re done here .
i think i feel it .
feel what ?
the bullet . it &apos;s right next to the heart .
there &apos;s still some bleeding . don &apos;t worry . i got it .
no , no , no , don &apos;t ! don &apos;t touch it !
oh , god ! what--what happened ?
what just happened ?
damn it , christina .
you essentially fired a bullet into that patient &apos;s chest
is what you did .
that &apos;s my intestine ?
yeah , and that part right there
is supposed to be on the inside of the membrane ,
not the outside .
dude , that is sick .
can i get a copy of one of these ?
i want to hang it from my fridge .
uh , hey , are we doing consults at the desk nowadays ?
&apos;cause i kinda need to use the computer .
oh , this is alex &apos;s brother .
aaron , this is arizona robbins .
oh , nice to meet you .
how come i didn &apos;t meet you at the wedding ?
actually , dr. robbins--
oh , that &apos;s right ,
that &apos;s right . no one &apos;s family came .
last @-@ minute switcheroo and all that .
what wedding ?
uh , alex and izzie &apos;s
no one &apos;s .
alex got married ?
i &apos;m just gonna go use the computer over there . bye .
he got married and he didn &apos;t even call us ?
no , it--it--it sounds weird ,
but it was totally a spur @-@ of @-@ the @-@ moment thing ,
you know , because of the cancer .
alex has cancer ?
lexie--
no , izzie has cancer .
who &apos;s izzie ?
alex &apos;s wife .
but ... she &apos;s not really his wife anymore .
it &apos;s--you know , i @-@ i really ,
i wouldn &apos;t worry about it .
they got divorced ?
no , but they a-- well , s @-@ she left .
and then , you know , she came back .
but he didn &apos;t really think it
was the right thing--okay .
lexie . stop talking .
you guys all right up there ?
there is shrapnel everywhere .
i was going for the bleeder . i didn &apos;t even touch the bullet .
i swear . i don &apos;t know what happened .
when your commanding officer tells you to stand down ,
you stand down . give me that .
i &apos;m not in the army . and you &apos;re not my commanding officer .
dr. altman and i are your attending .
and you are our subordinate .
you do exactly as we say even if you do not agree .
do you know why ? because we know more than you do .
for example , we know that devastator bullets
have chemicals in them ,
and sometimes they do not detonate on impact .
sometimes the heat from that bovie
is enough to make them explode .
do you understand ? dr. yang , do you understand ?
for whatever it &apos;s worth , dr. hunt ,
i would &apos;ve done the same thing yang did .
anybody would .
if it &apos;s a bleeder
the damage is already done .
there &apos;s no point in arguing about it . let &apos;s just fix it .
yang , i need your hands right now , right here .
okay , you see this ?
yes .
hold it .
hey . dude , how could you not have told me you got married ?
you told him ?
no . no . it--it wasn &apos;t me . w @-@ well , some of it was , but--
it was arizona robbins , and it was an accident .
yeah , she figured your own brother would already know
that you married somebody , but ,
see , this is why i didn &apos;t want to tell you ,
because i knew you &apos;d make a big deal out of it .
it is a big deal . you get married on the spur of the moment ,
you walk out on your wife--
i did not walk out on my wife . she walked out on me .
she walked out .
you have any idea what mom &apos;s gonna do when she finds out ?
she &apos;s gonna go off her meds .
she &apos;s not gonna do anything
because you &apos;re not gonna tell her , all right ?
you &apos;re gonna get your free surgery ,
you &apos;re gonna get back in your truck ,
and you &apos;re gonna get the hell outta here .
fine . you know what ? i don &apos;t need your free surgery .
i &apos;ll see ya . aaron , stop .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
i don &apos;t need your crap !
you walk out on us , you walk out on your wife ?
like father , like son .
take that back .
alex !
get off me , man !
alex !
what are you two fools-- oh , no , this is not hap--
alex !
get off !
karev !
what the hell is your problem , man ? !
you are ! hey , hey , hey !
alex !
you hitting people now , too ? you really did turn into dad .
walk away . alex , walk away . just walk away .
um , give him some space , okay ? don &apos;t follow him
ok
i need a gurney . run , honey .
right away .
she could wake up , right ?
i mean , people wake up from comas all the time .
i &apos;m sorry .
your wife &apos;s coma is irreversible .
dr. grey , would you explain it , please ?
mrs. clark &apos;s scans
showed a massive hemorrhage in her brain .
and the e.e.g. showed minimal brain activity .
but that means there &apos;s hope , right ?
because ... at least there &apos;s activity .
and--and her heart is still beating .
only because the mechanical ventilator is breathing for her .
when we turn the machine off ,
the heart won &apos;t get the oxygen it needs , and it will stop .
why would you turn it off ?
people can live for years on these machines .
mr. clark , the advanced directive your wife signed
specifically requested no mechanical ventilation .
she filled that form out three years ago
when the cancer was first diagnosed .
the doctor told her she had six months to live .
and she held on for another three years .
she &apos;ll come back from this , too . you &apos;ll see .
you can &apos;t unplug her .
legally , we don &apos;t have a choice , sir .
but ... she &apos;s my wife .
it &apos;s my choice .
it &apos;s your wife &apos;s choice ...
and she made it three years ago .
you said the surgery went fine .
that &apos;s what you said .
it did . but--
no , no , you &apos;re not a doctor . you &apos;re a child !
and you &apos;re useless ! i &apos;m done talking with you .
i &apos;m done talking with all of you .
who &apos;s in charge here ?
he protected me my whole life , you know ?
kicked my dad &apos;s ass so hard ,
the son of a bitch never came back .
i always thought he did that for me .
but maybe he just likes throwing punches .
aaron , i like you . i do ,
but you can &apos;t talk about my friend that way . okay ?
i need you to count backwards from ten for me , okay ?
okay .
ten .
nine .
eight .
that &apos;s it .
a junkie dad , a crackpot mom ,
and somehow karev still became a doctor .
i &apos;m not easily impressed , but i &apos;m impressed .
uh , prep him . we &apos;ll go scrub .
yes , doctor .
dr. grey .
we &apos;re meeting gary clark in shepherd &apos;s office .
five minutes .
i told a patient &apos;s husband that ... she was fine ,
that her surgery went perfectly .
and the next thing we know , she has a stroke ,
and we are supposed to just unplug her .
and i know--i know that i am supposed to toughen up .
i know that i am supposed to not care ,
but how ... h @-@ how do you not care ?
it &apos;s the hardest part of the job ...
the very hardest part .
how did you do it ?
how did you learn ?
i &apos;m still learning .
why is her b.p. still low ? is she still bleeding up there ?
no , i got it under control .
we &apos;ve had l.r. and blood hanging since we got here ,
but we can &apos;t seem to catch up .
is her liver still bleeding ?
no , i think we got it .
no , dr. hunt , dr. torres is right .
there &apos;s still bleeding in the retroperitoneum .
we need a retractor in here .
that &apos;s a lot of blood .
avery , get in there , suction .
can you see where it &apos;s coming from ?
i can &apos;t see past the clots . avery ?
the suction &apos;s clogging now .
let &apos;s use our hands and scoop . come on . let &apos;s get in there .
did you check the uterine artery ?
that could be the source .
down to 64 over 32 .
we gotta stop this thing or we &apos;re gonna lose her .
if we hadn &apos;t been distracted by artillery in the o.r. ,
we might have found this bleed earlier .
hunt , not now .
that was , um ...
that was our fault in there . we were speaking in shorthand .
we forget sometimes that you guys are civilians
and that you don &apos;t know about ballistics .
no , it &apos;s not just that . it was ...
it &apos;s not the first time .
he &apos;s been ...
it &apos;s been ...
he has been through so much .
it &apos;s not like he talks about it .
he can &apos;t .
i mean , i can &apos;t talk about it either most days .
but ... owen had it worse than me .
he has it worse . he &apos;s triggered .
right now , he &apos;s triggered ,
and his triggers might never go away .
i mean , they &apos;ll get better over time ,
if you give him time , which you should ,
because he is in love with you .
he just needs time .
he needs therapy .
i @-@ i keep telling him to go to dr. wyatt--
no , don &apos;t--don &apos;t-- don &apos;t do that .
he won &apos;t go if you tell him to .
he &apos;s ... he &apos;s very ...
he &apos;s a guy that way , a man .
don &apos;t ever tell him what to do .
just ... just tell him how you feel .
when &apos;s the best time to have kids ?
the best time to have kids ...
is never .
what , you asked .
well , yeah , but--
they cry all the time , nonstop .
they never sleep . they &apos;re terrible conversationalists .
and they take everything you &apos;ve got--
all your time , all your focus , all your patience ,
all your sleep
everything till you got nothing left for you .
but this morning ...
little tuck woke me up
by ... putting his nose up against mine--
his cold , little nose .
and he goes , &quot; wake up . &quot;
and he got the &quot; k &quot; sound in &quot; wake . &quot; &quot; wake up . &quot;
see , up until today , he &apos;d say &quot; d &quot; instead of &quot; k. &quot;
&quot; wade up . &quot;
ha ! girl , him nailing that &quot; k &quot; sound ...
it &apos;s the pride i felt ,
the irrational , unbridled , joy ...
well , it &apos;s at least as good as any whipple .
look , if you &apos;re waiting for the perfect time to have kids ,
you &apos;re never going to have kids .
hey .
aaron &apos;s surgery went well .
his hernia defect was fairly large ,
but bailey was able to use mesh to bridge it .
so ...
he &apos;ll be waking up in a few minutes
if you want to stop by .
mr. clark , i &apos;m deeply sorry for your ...
for your loss .
no , don &apos;t ... don &apos;t speak about my wife
as if she &apos;s dead .
she &apos;s still here . she could wake up .
she &apos;s not gonna wake up , mr. clark ,
not with the brain damage she suffered .
you don &apos;t know that .
mr. clark ,
if we don &apos;t obey your wife &apos;s directive ,
if we ignore her wishes--
she signed that form three years ago--
her health will deteriorate . she &apos;ll lose body mass .
she &apos;ll have no immune system .
she &apos;ll require around @-@ the @-@ clock care ,
and that can become very expensive very quickly .
i don &apos;t care about that .
it &apos;ll be no life for either of you .
and that &apos;s why your wife signed the advanced directive .
she didn &apos;t want to have to live her life this way .
and she didn &apos;t want you to live your life this way either .
don &apos;t you speak for my wife .
don &apos;t you dare speak for my wife .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. clark ,
but the ethics committee has reviewed your case .
we are bound by law
to obey her wishes .
if you unplug my wife ...
you &apos;ll be killing her .
i &apos;m sorry .
you should , uh ...
take all the time you need to call your family ...
to say good @-@ bye .
there &apos;s no one to call .
we didn &apos;t have any family .
it was just us .
we didn &apos;t have any kids .
it &apos;s just me .
he &apos;s my sister &apos;s husband .
excuse me ?
don &apos;t play stupid .
i &apos;m not playing stupid . i am stupid .
i &apos;m stupid and i &apos;m humiliated
and ... i &apos;m sorry .
i just ... i &apos;ve never felt anything ...
i &apos;ve never felt like this before .
so i ... if you could just please forget what you saw ,
because i promise , you will never see it again ,
and ... and we ... we can just go back to being doctors .
please .
this day sucks . i hate this day .
oh , god .
you don &apos;t have to be here . you can go .
i &apos;m just making sure you don &apos;t croak ,
and then i &apos;m outta here .
you ... saved my ass every day when were kids .
you ... you were a better parent than mom and dad put together .
and everyday i feel bad for amber
that she has just me instead of you .
what happened to you , man ?
i send you money every month .
i send mom her meds .
you want that to stop ?
i am this close to being a real surgeon .
i can &apos;t ...
i @-@ i can &apos;t be in that and do this .
i can &apos;t .
amber &apos;s a good kid .
she turned out okay . you &apos;d like her .
you turned out okay , too , aaron .
i &apos;m sorry your wife left you ...
or got cancer or whatever .
thanks .
we repaired the damage to your liver and intestine ,
cleaned out your fractured hip and fixed your lung .
there was a bullet , and some shrapnel near your heart .
oh , my god .
but dr. altman was able to repair all the damage .
thank you . thank you all so much .
honestly , i @-@ i don &apos;t even know what to say .
there ... there was , uh ,
there were complications , gina .
there was a lot of bleeding in the abdomen .
the uterine artery was involved .
we were able to stop the bleed , but ...
in order to do that , we had to ...
remove your uterus .
what ?
we had to perform a hysterectomy .
i &apos;m sorry .
she ... she can &apos;t ... we can &apos;t have kids ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
we can never have kids ?
oh , god .
baby , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s all right , baby .
it &apos;s okay , baby .
baby , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
baby , it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s not . shh .
how long has he been there ?
about three hours .
it &apos;s time .
see it through .
mr. clark .
no , please .
i &apos;m sorry .
i keep telling myself
there &apos;s a chance she &apos;ll wake up ...
once you turn off the respirator .
there is a chance ...
even ...
even if it &apos;s just less than a 1 % chance ...
that she &apos;ll start breathing again , right ?
miracles do happen .
that &apos;s what ... that &apos;s what she always says .
please .
please , darling , wake up .
p @-@ please .
i am so sorry .
please . please .
please , please wake up .
please wake up .
please wake up .
please wake up .
hey .
were you checking up on me in that surgery today ?
no , i wasn &apos;t checking up on you . i was observing .
you know that &apos;s the closest i get to an o.r. these days ?
i &apos;m gonna choose to believe you on that .
they were married 32 years .
there was nothing you could &apos;ve done .
i &apos;m going home to my wife . you should do the same thing .
looking good , gina .
you &apos;re gonna be back on the beat in no time .
that &apos;s what they call it , right , the beat ?
yes , they do , and , no , she won &apos;t .
jimmy and i talked about it . i &apos;m quitting .
what ?
why ?
well , &apos; cause jimmy &apos;s right .
i mean , it &apos;s a job , you know ? and i love it .
but i love my husband , too .
and what , we &apos;re gonna adopt
ten haitian orphans or something ?
eight .
well , congratulations .
thank you .
gina .
i want you to know ,
i did the best i could with the review board .
josh , it &apos;s okay
and they want you back on the job .
are you kidding me ?
welcome back , officer thompson .
oh , my god . hey , look out now .
watch out .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
thank you so much .
where &apos;s aaron ?
he went back to iowa .
you let him drive after surgery ?
i &apos;m not his dad . he &apos;s got my number .
you know you &apos;re nothing like your father , right ?
you &apos;re nothing like your mother .
you &apos;re good .
so you &apos;d be good .
you &apos;d be a good mom .
it &apos;s the most important job in the world .
you probably should need a license to do it .
but then most of us wouldn &apos;t even pass the written exam .
you ever wonder if moisturizer really works ?
i mean , what &apos;s in the stuff ?
i &apos;m a doctor , and i haven &apos;t even heard of half of it .
uh , &quot; dimethicone . &quot; no idea .
&quot; distearyldim @-@ dimo ... &quot;
hmm . i--yeah , i can &apos;t even pronounce that .
so ... &quot; disteary ... &quot;
i want to have a baby .
and i ... i can &apos;t talk about lotion
or pound cake or anything else ,
because you don &apos;t want to have a baby , and i do .
so ...
we &apos;re gonna talk about it .
yeah .
we are gonna talk about it .
some people are naturals .
they were born to do it .
some have other gifts .
oh , you &apos;re making dinner .
it &apos;s just pasta .
it smells good .
are you baking bread ?
so , uh ...
you said you don &apos;t want to have kids .
what ?
oh , the sausages are burning .
no , they &apos;re fine .
no , they &apos;re burning .
cristina , listen , they &apos;re fine . they &apos;re fine .
damn it !
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
are you scared of me ?
i don &apos;t want to be .
i have to go back to dr . wyatt .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
but the good news is ...
biology dictates , you don &apos;t have to do it alone .
hey .
hey .
i don &apos;t want you to be alone .
if anything should happen to me ...
i don &apos;t want it to ... just be you .
well , we would make pretty babies .
so you &apos;re thinking about it , then ?
oh , i &apos;m thinking about it .
you can waste your whole life wondering ...
but the only way to find out what kind of parent you &apos;d be
is to finally stop talking about it ...
but we &apos;re not making babies right now .
we &apos;re practicing .
it &apos;s very important to practice .
and just do it .
oh , you taste good .
you have no idea how good you taste .
oh , mark , i ...
ohh , i &apos;m really , really ...
enjoying myself with you .
i @-@ i am , but i need to , uh ...
i need to be honest about something .
no , you don &apos;t ...
if you &apos;re honestly enjoying yourself .
i @-@ i am .
i am .
then right now ...
that &apos;s as honest as you have to be .
okay .
now turn over .
i want to try a little milk chocolate
on your belly button .
ignore &apos; em . they &apos;ll go away .
i &apos;ll get rid of &apos; em .
sloan .
the baby &apos;s coming ! the baby &apos;s coming right now !
oh , the baby &apos;s coming !
