It's bad, huh?
What happened?
It must be the storm.
Something's out there.
Guys.
Gotcha!
That's so not funny, Alison!
I thought it was hilarious, girls.
Ali, did you download the new Beyonce?
Not yet.
I'm loving her new video.
Maybe a little too much, Em.
Your turn. Go on.
Careful, Aria.
Take too much, and you'll tell us all your secrets.
Friends share secrets.
That's what keeps us close.
Drink up.
Em.
Whoa.
Where's Ali and Spencer?
We don't know.
Ali?
She's gone.
What do you mean she's gone?
I've looked everywhere for her.
I think I heard her scream.
Aria, are you okay?
It's weird to be home.
We were gone a year.
When you're 16, that's a long time.
I still think about her everyday.
Why don't you call your friends?
They don't know we're back from dad's sabbatical.
On the news, they're calling it
the anniversary of Alison's disappearance,
like it's a party or something.
Why don't you give them a call?
You five were inseparable,
and those feelings don't just go away.
I need a ride to lacrosse!
I'll take him.
Got lacrosse today?
It's first tryouts,
and all my stuff's in about a hundred boxes.
A hundred?
You know what I mean.
Come on, let's go look in the garage.
Come on.
Listen, I know coming back here
brings up a lot of memories.
You okay?
Dad, I'm still keeping your secret, okay?
I mean, are you okay with Alison?
And they're running off to practice.
We are officially home.
Hey, what time am I picking you up?
Uh, six.
Okay, I'm gonna grab some food.
Can I get a cheeseburger, please?
You got it.
You all right down there?
I'm a bit jetlagged. I just got back from Europe.
Where in Europe?
Iceland.
I spent some time in Reykjavik
before I went to Amsterdam.
It's a great city.
So, do you go to Hollis?
Just graduated.
I'm gonna start my first teaching job.
Yeah, I think I'd like to teach.
God, I love this song.
B26.
What's your major?
Uh, well, I'm leaning toward English.
That's what I'm teaching.
Well, and I write too, but...
So far, it's mostly personal.
Just for me.
I'm impressed.
Why?
Well, I tried writing.
I didn't get very far.
You're lucky.
If you're writing for yourself,
it's pure passion.
Maybe you'd let me read something of yours.
Yeah? You'd really want to?
Yeah.
You're smart, you've traveled,
great taste in music.
Like to know more about you.
Yeah.
I'd like to know more about you too.
Could I see the Pradas in the front?
I'll have to put some in the back.
But they're all maybes.
Hey, is this me?
Or is it a little too much your mother?
I am loving those glasses. How much?
350.
I'll be right back.
I cannot believe Spencer Hastings
actually has time to shop.
I mean, you're interning for the mayor,
taking classes at Hollis, and redoing the barn.
And in your leisure moments, you facebook and tweet.
You know me. I like to stay busy.
It's called a summer vacay, Spence.
You spent yours sunning and shopping.
Tweet-tweet.
Did you see the paper today?
Yeah.
She's gone, but she's everywhere.
I can't believe it's been a year.
Do you remember what Ali said that night,
about our secrets keeping us close?
I think it was the opposite.
So! What's the occasion?
Family dinner.
We're meeting Melissa's fiance?
Did Miss perfect find a Mr. Perfect?
He's a med student, so everyone's thrilled.
Then that's not the right top.
You need to turn heads.
Away from Melissa? Please.
She doesn't always have to win.
See you around the playground.
See you.
Hey, miss!
You forgot your bag.
Thank you.
I so thought you were busted.
Nice scarf.
Nice glasses.
Later. See ya.
Good luck.
Hey.
Look, it's the first day. I don't want to be late.
I love you, Aria. You know that, right?
Yeah. I know.
And you know that I love your mom.
Do you?
I made a mistake, okay?
And I will be sorry about it for the rest of my life.
I just hope that someday you'll be able to forgive me.
I hope so too.
Aria!
Hey, guys!
Alison!
Hey! You hear Mona?
Hey, Aria! Maybe we should wait.
Hey, guys!
My god.
Is she ever gonna get a clue? What a loser.
Come here.
Hey, isn't that your dad's car?
Aria?
Emily.
When did you get back?
Hey.
Yesterday.
I almost didn't recognize you.
I think the last time we saw each other,
You had a pink stripe in your hair.
Well, when your parents want you to be yourself
And you don't know who you are...
You wore it well.
You should have called about this.
It's so weird just running into you here.
Well, we've kind of lost touch, emily, remember?
That's what we had to do.
I saw a poster of Alison yesterday.
It's awful.
I mean, we all know she's dead, right?
I just never heard anyone say it.
So, I hear the new teacher's really hot.
Is that Hanna?
She's the "It" Girl now.
And where there's Hanna, there's Mona.
That's mona?
Can you believe it?
Wow. Talk about a makeover.
What's up with her?
You two fighting?
We didn't just fall out of touch with you, Aria.
We all fell out of touch with each other.
They're not so close anymore either.
So they're friendly, but not friends.
Holy crap.
Sorry.
Uh, I'm mr. Fitz, your new english teacher.
Alison?
I can't believe they sold the house.
Just too many memories for the Dilaurentises.
I can't even imagine.
It's just so weird to think
of other people living in Alison's house.
I know, honey.
Aria's back.
Does she still have that pink hair?
No, mom, she doesn't.
You know something? I never really understood that family.
Why would a mother let her daughter do something like that?
Because they believe their kids are their equals,
not their property.
Honey, I don't think you're my property,
but I'm your mom.
What kind of mother would I be if I let you
run around looking like a Goth?
That kind of lifestyle might fly in Europe,
But it's not gonna get you very far here in Rosewood.
Not everyone dreams of making it in Rosewood, mom.
Oh?
Some people dream of making it out.
You want that?
Maya st. Germain, A.K.A. New girl.
I'm Emily.
Welcome to the neighborhood.
Thank you.
Mmm. Foie gras and cornichons.
My favorites.
It's from my mother.
I figured.
Oh, that stuff was in my room.
You can have anything you want.
It all belonged to Alison.
Is she a friend of yours?
She was, a long time ago.
That's all I get? No details?
Uh, there were five of us who used to hang out, but...
We don't anymore.
Would it be outrageous of me to ask
if you'll help with our last few boxes?
Yes.
But I don't mind.
So, why aren't you still friends
with the girl who used to live here?
You ask a lot of questions.
How else am I supposed to get to know you?
There you go. Another question.
Fine. Your turn.
Ask me anything.
Is this your boyfriend?
His name is Justin.
He's cute.
He's also 3,000 miles away.
My boyfriend's name is Ben.
What's he like?
He's a swimmer, like me.
I bet you're good.
You totally have the body.
My mom's a cellist.
They're building a studio.
Do you play?
Yeah.
But not the cello.
If you're a big jock,
does that mean you'd kill me if I smoked a little weed?
Now?
I won't if you don't want me to.
Where are your parents?
Relax.
They're out.
Go ahead.
You want to join me?
Okay.
First time?
No.
Yes.
So I'm corrupting you.
You okay with that?
Yeah. I think I am.
Hey, what do you think?
You have an eye for design. I absolutely love it.
Thank you.
Honestly, when mom said you were converting the barn to a loft,
I couldn't see it, but it's beautiful.
Job well done.
I'm glad you like it.
And I totally appreciate your letting us move in.
What?
Ren and I are staying in the barn
while we redo my place in the city.
I'm moving in for junior year, Melissa.
That's the deal that I made with mom and dad.
I got the grades, I did the internship,
I gave up my summer because I wanted this.
Well, you'll just have to wait.
Why can't you stay in my room?
We're a couple, Spencer.
We need our own space, and mom and dad agree.
But they promised me.
Is everything okay?
I'm Ren.
I was hoping you'd be happy for me.
Well, you know what they say about hope.
Breeds eternal misery.
Sounds like she was counting on moving into the barn.
Don't worry about Spencer. She'll get over it.
Shouldn't you know better?
I mean, you are a med student, right?
You're a bit of a smart-ass.
A bit?
Does my sister know you smoke?
Does she have to know everything?
I'm sorry that we're moving into your loft.
If you want me to say something.
It wouldn't make a difference.
Thank you for being sorry.
You're not like Melissa's usual boyfriends.
How am I unusual?
We're late for dinner.
I actually like you.
That's what's unusual.
You told me you went to Hollis.
No. I said I was thinking about majoring in english.
And that's true.
Look, I think you're amazing, Aria.
When I first met you, I thought...
"Who is this girl?"
I'm still that girl. Nothing's changed.
Yes. Yes, it has. I'm your teacher.
I know it's not just me.
You...you feel like this is right for us too.
It's not right.
We just can't.
Thanks for walking me home.
It's no big deal.
Practice doesn't start until four.
I've never had a jock friend before.
I guess that makes you my first.
Are you okay?
It's hard for me to talk about.
I didn't tell you everything
about the girl who used to live here.
Alison.
She disappeared last summer.
She's still missing.
That must have been awful for you.
I used to think if I didn't talk about her,
I wouldn't think about her.
But you still do.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
See you tomorrow?
Yeah. Bye.
Hey, you been hanging out with Aria?
Not really.
你找到了另一个可以亲吻的朋友 Alison]
Emily.
Is everything all right?
Why wouldn't it be?
Perfect time for a jacuzzi.
I thought you guys weren't moving in till next week.
Melissa wanted to get settled before classes start.
You wouldn't happen to have a towel, would you?
Tough day at school?
Tough field hockey practice.
I rowed for Oxford.
That looks good on a med school app.
I did it 'cause I loved it.
You probably have a fluid buildup in your bursa sac.
I bet you say that to all the girls.
I can help.
Okay...
Dr. Ren.
That's awesome.
Is that all right?
Ren?
Who were you talking to?
No one.
Found them.
Look what else I found.
Ohh. She used to drag that thing everywhere.
I think you're happy to be back.
Aren't you?
Well, haven't decided yet.
Ohh. You and Aria are so much alike.
I don't think she's happy to be home either.
I know it was like a vacation from our real life, but...
I felt like we really bonded when we were away.
Well, we had to connect. We didn't know anybody else.
I don't want to lose that.
Are you really worried that we will?
It's just easy for stuff to get in the way.
What do you mean? What kind of stuff?
You know, I'm really surprised that she brought that with us.
Well, she loves it because you gave it to her.
What kind of stuff could get in the way of us?
No, nothing, nothing. You know me.
I just get a little overly obsessed about work, that's all.
We're good, Ella.
Come here.
Mm. It's all good.
Oh, I drove past Alison's house today.
It's definitely something I haven't missed.
Oh, god. A year later.
Imagine what that poor family is going through.
I can't. I don't ever want to imagine.
If anything ever happened to you...
Nothing is gonna happen.
We are safe. We're together.
And we're home.
但记住了 如果你吻他 我会告密的 A]
Are you gonna eat that, sweetie?
I'm being a friend, Hanna.
Aren't you supposed to be at Alison's?
Hi, girls!
Hi, Ian.
You still need help with your scoop, Spence?
I've got my stick in the car.
Ian, what are you, her babysitter?
You need to tell your sister.
Tell me what?
Nothing.
Come on.
Outside.
What the hell are you doing?
She's gonna find out.
No, she's not.
I promise you, she is,
because if you don't tell her, I will.
I thought you were my friend.
Don't you get it?
I'm trying to help you do the right thing.
It was one kiss.
Now, you listen to me, Alison.
Or what?
If you say one word to my sister about Ian,
I will tell everyone the truth about the Jenna thing.
Alison?
I'm sorry for just stopping by.
No. Any time, em. Come on, you know that.
Somebody left a note in my locker.
From "A"?
You too?
Do you really think it's her? Is it possible?
Only Alison could have known.
What? Known... known what?
It was...
Personal?
I really believed she was dead.
Yeah. Yeah, we all did.
Could she really be back?
I think she's playing with us.
Why would she do that?
It's Alison that we're talking about here.
I mean, wasn't that her favorite sport?
Should we tell someone?
I don't...
I don't know about you, but...
I can't.
I'm glad you're back.
It's funny...
I mean, even though I grew up here,
I feel like a total outsider.
Me too.
I ran into Ella Montgomery today.
Why didn't you tell me Aria was back?
It's not like we're still friends.
She didn't know your father left.
I hate telling that story.
So change the story. I did.
You grew up. You grew apart.
It was mutual, and, honestly,
we are much happier without him.
Hanna.
Say it enough, and you'll actually start to believe it.
Well, I have to admit, it does sound a lot better than the truth.
Nobody needs to know that we got dumped.
"We" Didn't get dumped. I did.
He left both of us.
If that's Mona, I'm staging an intervention.
Hanna. It's dinnertime.
It's Ashley.
Yes, I left it on your desk.
Hanna Marin?
Yeah. Why?
Is your mother home?
Let me call you back.
What's this about?
We received a call from Rosewood mall security.
They have your daughter on tape
shoplifting a pair of sunglasses.
I'm sure there's been a mistake.
I don't think so. Could you turn around?
Mom.
What's going on?
Let's go.
Really?
In a small town like this,
what people think about you matters.
I know.
Then why would you risk it all to steal a pair of sunglasses?
Hanna,
I buy you everything you need to be popular.
That's not why I do it.
Then why do...? This is something you do?
A few times.
This is about your father, isn't it?
You think this is going to get his attention.
I made a mistake.
In Rosewood, you don't have room to make a mistake.
And neither do I.
I'm sorry.
I'll fix it somehow.
You will deny you did anything wrong.
It was a misunderstanding.
But...
I'm taking care of it.
Maya!
Emily!
I thought something might have happened to you.
I tried to call you.
What's going on?
They found your friend.
I knew she was back. Is she inside? Emily!
I'm sorry.
They found Alison's body.
I hear the cops take Hanna to the police station today.
You don't think she'd ever talk about...
The Jenna thing?
We made promise.
Current owners of the residence were in the process of
demolishing the structure to make room for a renovation project
when workers made the gruesome discovery.
The parents of the deceased were unavailable for comment,
but a family spokesperson has confirmed
the gazebo was under construction
the summer 15-year-old Alison Dilaurentis disappeared.
Tonight, the family is asking for privacy
as they come to terms
with the sad ending to a year-long mystery,
And local authorities are coming to terms
with the fact a killer is at large in Rosewood.
Thank you so much.
The discovery of her body rocked this community,
and today, hundreds of mourners gather
to say goodbye to Alison Dilaurentis.
Was she a friend of yours?
Do you care?
I don't know what I feel worse about...
having to stay away from you
or being a jerk about it.
Yeah, she was one of my best friends.
I'm sorry.
For Alison, or for being a jerk?
Both.
Thank you.
I would never want to do anything that would get you in trouble.
Goodbye, Ezra.
Mrs. Dilaurentis.
Aria!
I'm so glad you came.
I asked the other girls to sit together up front.
It's what Alison would have wanted.
Of course.
Poor Ali.
Can you believe what a scene this is?
Alison would have loved it.
Popular in life and death.
No, thanks. I don't...
Today, I think you do.
Anyone we know?
No, it's just my mom sending me a text.
Emily and I aren't the only ones who got messages from "A," are we?
Oh, my god.
It's Jenna.
Did you see that Jenna Marshall was here?
I didn't realize she and Ali were friends.
They weren't.
The lord give them and
the lord take them away.
Emily. Spencer.
Aria and Hanna.
Do we know you?
I'm detective Wilden.
I understand you were all good friends with the victim.
Yeah, we were.
I'm gonna need to talk to each one of you.
We talked to the police when Alison went missing.
And I intend to go over every one of your statements.
This is no longer a missing persons investigation.
It's a murder.
Rest assured,
I will find out what happened that summer.
Do you think he knows about...?
No. How could he?
Oh, my god.
It's from...
I got one too.
"I'm still here, bitches ...and I know everything.
A'."
第一季 第一集
