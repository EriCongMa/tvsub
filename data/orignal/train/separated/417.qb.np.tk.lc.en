you better run ! meredith !
you can run faster than that girl !
meredith ?
where &apos;d you go baby ?
meredith ?
come out come out wherever you are .
meredith ?
fan out .
meredith ...
meredith ?
found her !
no ! please ...
please ...
it &apos;s all right .
let me know when you &apos;re finished .
no !
no !
welcome to the 21st century .
yay technology .
behold . everyone has a new tablet .
we &apos;ve gone paperless ?
fear not doctor of the dark ages .
i went old school for your anti @-@ technology quirk .
paper files hard copy photos .
but the abacus is your responsibility .
garcia not that i don &apos;t appreciate your efforts
but exactly where did the funding for these come from ?
i did a thing .
a thing ?
best not talk about the thing .
we &apos;ll talk about the thing later .
ok . instead let &apos;s talk about harvest season .
because it is harvest season in indiana
and farmers are finding more than corn in their fields .
meredith joy kimberly jukes and amanda frye
were all discovered murdered in johnson county indiana .
all 3 women were exotic dancers
living in different counties in the state .
kimberly jukes the first victim
went missing 6 weeks ago .
and in each instance the women finished their shifts
but they never made it to their cars .
it says here amanda frye was found 90 miles from her house .
this guy &apos;s going a long way to abduct his victims .
if he &apos;s dumping the bodies in the same county
it &apos;s a good chance he &apos;s located nearby .
it shouldn &apos;t be too hard to work up a geographical profile .
meredith joy put up quite a fight .
she &apos;s got defensive wounds all over her body .
and the lab discovered two
different samples of dna under her fingernails
so we &apos;re dealing with at least a team .
one that rapes beats
and strangles their victims in a cornfield .
they &apos;re using condoms . i bet one of these guys has a record
and he doesn &apos;t want us connecting the dna .
and they &apos;re accelerating their attack schedule .
it &apos;s 3 weeks between the first and second kill
2 weeks between the second and third .
meredith joy died on october 31st .
now they &apos;re down to one week .
who &apos;s missing ?
her name is stephanie wilson .
she was abducted last night from club prowl in tippecanoe county .
she finished her shift at midnight
but she never made it home to her 2 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
babysitter called the police
and stephanie &apos;s car was left in the parking lot like the others .
and there &apos;s a clear pattern .
all the women have been abducted on friday night
and murdered sometime sunday evening .
which means we &apos;ve got less than 2 days to save stephanie wilson .
stephanie .
hey wake up sweetheart .
hey come on sleepyhead .
you gotta get back to work now .
that &apos;s a girl .
come on now .
rise and shine .
hey no sleeping in . it &apos;s time to get back to work .
hey don &apos;t you struggle .
hey don &apos;t struggle .
don &apos;t struggle .
you know better than that don &apos;t you ?
yeah you do . yeah .
all right .
batter up .
whoo ! yes sir .
oh ! god what the hell man !
wake up . you don &apos;t want to miss the show .
here . take this .
no no .
&quot; the herd seek out the great
not for their sake but for their influence
and the great welcome them out of vanity or need . &quot;
napoleon bonaparte .
hey guys .
look at the patterns on the cornfields .
it &apos;s all hard turns and zigzags .
they had to have been chasing these women .
do you think they escaped ?
maybe if it was just the one time but all 3 ?
they let them go so they could chase them again .
the women probably thought they were being released .
i &apos;d say we &apos;re most likely looking for
two dominant alpha male personalities
but we shouldn &apos;t rule out one dominant who allows his submissive
to have sex with these victims in order to control him .
well it certainly speaks to their arrogance
if they &apos;re that confident the women won &apos;t get away .
prostitutes and strippers usually make easy targets .
maybe they need to up the challenge .
the hunt could be what gets them off .
garcia focus on prior sexual crimes in the area .
this kind of confidence doesn &apos;t get built overnight .
yeah i am compiling as we are face @-@ timing .
i &apos;m also running dna results through unsolved crimes
in indiana and the surrounding states .
good . let me know as soon as you find anything .
you know interestingly all 3 victims
had downers and uppers in their system .
well were the drugs used to subdue the women
or is it a ruse to get them to come home with them ?
prentiss and reid go to the club
where stephanie wilson worked to find out .
dave you and morgan work the dumpsite
and i &apos;ll work victimology at the local sheriff &apos;s station .
you think you can give me the runaround kemp ?
i don &apos;t think so .
no one talks to the press but me .
this is my department my investigation .
do you understand ?
you make me look bad .
it &apos;s not enough i got the fbi coming in .
no now i have to deal with fumbled plays from my own team ?
desk duty 2 weeks .
dismissed .
sheriff .
sheriff jeff salters .
aaron hotchner .
sorry about that .
one of my guys leaked the news
about the dead woman to the press .
i needed to uh send a message .
why is the investigation being kept a secret ?
well that was my call .
i don &apos;t want these guys skipping town
before i have a chance to arrest them .
this ends in my jurisdiction .
has stephanie wilson &apos;s father arrived ?
he &apos;s waiting in the conference room .
he &apos;s pretty messed up about the whole thing .
that &apos;s understandable .
i just don &apos;t get it .
you know how many strippers and prostitutes
i saw get beaten up and raped when i worked the city ?
sometimes it &apos;s like they &apos;re asking for it .
nobody asks for this sheriff .
not consciously anyway .
shall we go in ?
i think i &apos;ll speak to him alone .
look ...
i call it like i see it .
these women are victims of heinous crimes .
i won &apos;t have you judging them in front of their families .
and i won &apos;t have you telling me how to run my show .
the governor may have requested your help
but this is my case .
it &apos;s not a show .
it is your case .
and you can watch from the outside .
that had to hurt .
let &apos;s just hope he can take care of business again tomorrow .
are you suddenly a doubter ?
&apos;cause there &apos;s the door man .
are you seeing this ?
... live at schmidt farm
where the body of meredith joy was discovered late last week
making her the third victim in recent weeks
to turn up dead in a cornfield .
the johnson county sheriff &apos;s department remains quiet
about their investigation thus far
but we &apos;ll stay on the scene as this story ...
what are you doing here ? i thought we agreed
not to come to each other &apos;s work .
what did you get me into ?
me ? i didn &apos;t know anything about this .
those girls are dead chris .
chase them around have some fun with them
they won &apos;t remember a thing . that &apos;s what you told me .
scott that &apos;s how it was .
you really didn &apos;t know ?
where &apos;s michael ?
i &apos;ll meet you out back in 10 minutes .
she said she was making extra money waiting tables at a bar .
she &apos;s my little girl . i didn &apos;t question it .
god this is all my fault .
no one could have foreseen stephanie &apos;s abduction .
it &apos;s not your fault .
i know i know . i just i--i can &apos;t--
amy needs her mother .
what are you doing to try to find her ?
we &apos;re helping local law enforcement by building a profile .
profile ? why aren &apos;t you just out there looking for her ?
who knows what these-- these men are doing to her .
i need you to find my daughter .
we are looking for her .
hopefully this will point us in the right direction .
no no that &apos;s not good enough .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
i just um
this has all just been too much .
it &apos;s all right .
mr. wilson i assure you we will not stop
until we find stephanie .
what would it take for you or one of your co @-@ workers
to go home with a customer ?
nothing . i have a boyfriend .
does he know that you work here ?
it &apos;s how we met .
he doesn &apos;t have a problem with it . do you ?
no not at all . i &apos;m from las vegas .
i don &apos;t have a problem with it .
i just um these are questions that we have to ask .
we are not judging you .
we &apos;re just trying to find stephanie .
now you said you met your boyfriend here .
so you did go home with a customer once before .
those were the early days .
everyone &apos;s a little wild in the beginning .
not the veterans ?
we know to play it safe .
was stephanie the type of girl who played it safe ?
she never really went through a wild phase .
all she cared about was getting home to her daughter .
did anyone try and take her home last night ?
everyone tries .
every night .
nothing stood out ?
i know she got asked to go to a party .
we all did . but she turned them down .
them plural ?
there were these two guys .
they got dances from each of us .
what kind of party were they offering ?
i never got a chance to find out .
it &apos;s bad business to discuss private deals on the floor .
can you show me where you and stephanie gave them their dances ?
yeah . over here .
i was in here
while stephanie was in that one .
ok .
could you sit down ?
yeah .
all right i can see the whole room
but i can &apos;t see my partner .
if you &apos;re working as a team
you both want to see the girl you &apos;re gonna take home .
why would they do it somewhere where they can &apos;t see each other ?
we should take a look at the club surveillance footage .
only 2 cameras . there &apos;s a lot of blind spots .
how do you keep an eye on all the girls ?
we got the one guy in the back
one guy on the floor at all times .
it looks pretty full .
are you always this busy on the weekends ?
only on theme nights .
the unsubs probably picked
crowded nights to make sure they blend in .
well they &apos;re smart .
they make a plan of attack before they get to the club
then they separate and choose their prey .
i doubt they were very happy when stephanie turned them down .
alpha personalities don &apos;t handle rejection well .
they abducted her from the parking lot
just like the others .
it didn &apos;t matter what she said .
stephanie was going to that party whether she wanted to or not .
how the hell did they find this place ?
we must have taken 30 different turns to get here .
thank you deputy .
we &apos;re definitely looking for a local .
we should position black @-@ and @-@ whites in the area .
we might be able to spot the unsubs before their next hunt .
garcia should pull surveillance footage of gas stations too .
with all this driving
they have to be getting their fuel somewhere .
i don &apos;t get it .
what ?
these guys enjoy the thrill of the chase .
i mean all right i &apos;ll buy that .
but what i don &apos;t buy is them taking such a big risk .
well they wouldn &apos;t let their victim loose
unless they were certain she couldn &apos;t get away .
so what would make them so certain ?
manpower .
it would take one person to drive the truck .
it would take another guy to
handle the spotlight to track her in the field .
is that enough ?
not for me . i mean come on look at this place .
how can two guys guarantee that she &apos;s not gonna get away ?
they drug her .
maybe they think that &apos;s enough .
or we &apos;re dealing with more than two unsubs .
hey fellas .
who &apos;s tagging in ?
did you really kill those girls ?
i was protecting us .
you protected us so well the fbi &apos;s here .
what ?
they got here this morning .
what do we do drug her and dump her ?
i don &apos;t want any part of this .
too late .
you &apos;re in just as deep as the rest of us .
we only had sex with them . we didn &apos;t kill anyone .
first of all a jury &apos;s not gonna call it sex .
they &apos;re gonna call it rape .
second of all i told you i &apos;d take care of it .
what did you think i meant ?
i don &apos;t know . that-- that you &apos;d drug them
to make them forget us or something .
then let them go not this .
if we &apos;d have let them go
we &apos;d all be in jail right now .
like it or not we &apos;re safe &apos; cause of what i did .
none of that matters right now . the fbi are after us .
what do we do ?
so what if the feds are here ?
we covered our tracks .
they can &apos;t connect the girls to us .
we still got our whole weekend .
i say we lay low
enjoy ourselves .
party ain &apos;t over yet baby .
we know these guys are local
so we should be looking for anybody working fields or agriculture .
only problem is
more than half of indiana is farmland .
garcia were either of the other clubs having theme nights
when the girls went missing ?
oh my gosh .
all of them .
meredith joy was abducted on dollar draft night
amanda frye on ladies night
and kimberly jukes on fantasy football friday .
so reid you were right . they &apos;re targeting nights
that the clubs were at capacity
so they won &apos;t be easily recognized by the security cameras .
reid .
guys i think i found our two unsubs .
these guys have gotten dances from half the girls in the club .
they &apos;re very careful to hide their faces from the cameras .
and this guy seems to be
communicating with someone across the room .
but if his partner &apos;s sitting in the booth next to him
who &apos;s he talking to ?
garcia do you have another angle ?
no luck head hotch @-@ o the other camera faces the door .
if there &apos;s a third unsub
we could be looking at a pack .
that makes sense . if these two in the booths are underlings
they would look to the pack leader to choose the target .
that &apos;s why they abduct the women from the parking lot .
stephanie only knew about the first two men .
if there was a third she never would have seen them coming .
garcia any luck with the dna database ?
nothing in a 5 @-@ state radius
but i am opening my parameters to nationwide .
that is gonna take some time though .
that &apos;s the one thing we don &apos;t have .
we have 24 hours before stephanie wilson ends up
in a cornfield .
we might even have less than that .
what do you mean ?
two unsubs working toward a common goal is one thing .
add a third and all bets are off .
we only found two traces of dna .
one of them probably doesn &apos;t know about the murders .
the pack hierarchy will start to break down .
they &apos;ll question their leader .
and when that happens
the alpha will have to reassert his authority
and stephanie wilson will be the object of his aggression .
you should have told me .
after all we &apos;ve been through i don &apos;t get why you &apos;d lie to me .
i &apos;m worried about scotty .
you know him best . you think he &apos;ll run to the sheriff ?
no . he &apos;s been with us on two hunts now .
he knows he &apos;ll get locked up if he talks .
he &apos;ll stay loyal .
let &apos;s hope so .
no no no !
you &apos;re gonna have to do a hell of a lot better than that girl
or we &apos;re gonna have a real problem .
what are you doing ? !
god !
aah ! no !
now dance !
who &apos;s there ?
i brought you some breakfast .
i &apos;m not hungry .
look if you eat i &apos;ll take off the blindfold .
but you have to promise not to look at me . can you do that ?
ok .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s ok .
just keep your eyes closed .
you can open them now .
you &apos;re going to kill me aren &apos;t you ?
no .
no it &apos;s just ...
i don &apos;t know .
please let me go .
i can &apos;t do that .
i don &apos;t want to die .
i don &apos;t want that either .
then let me go .
i have a daughter . she &apos;s only 2 .
please .
i want to see my baby .
i &apos;m going to do everything i can to get you back to her .
i promise .
you shouldn &apos;t make a promise you can &apos;t keep .
i was just saying that to get her to eat ok ?
we need her to last don &apos;t we ?
whoops this must have fell off .
there we go .
go wait in the truck .
hold up .
you forgot something .
stay with him .
i just can &apos;t believe someone from our community would be involved in this .
don &apos;t underestimate a pack leader &apos;s influence .
these guys are being manipulated into playing his game .
we think at least one member of the pack
didn &apos;t know that the women were being killed .
why here ? why now ?
each of the women was abducted on friday night and not killed until sunday .
so ?
so why are they avoiding the work week ?
could be blue collar .
they like the game
but they can &apos;t let it interfere with their jobs .
i don &apos;t think so .
the pack strikes not only on the clubs&apos;
busiest nights but also the cheapest .
they have a limited income .
they blend in with a young crowd
and they &apos;re unavailable monday to friday .
if one of them is from out of state
that would explain why they didn &apos;t start their killing until the summer was over .
what would ?
we believe the men we &apos;re looking for are college students .
that &apos;s why the killings coincided
with the beginning of the fall semester .
this means they &apos;re most likely in their late teens to mid @-@ 20s
but don &apos;t rule out older students who transferred in
or enlisted in the military right out of high school .
right now we &apos;re canvassing colleges in the area .
college students are impressionable kids
eager to fit in and find their place in the world .
this environment is conducive to the creation of a pack .
in a typical pack not all members are created equally .
there &apos;ll be a dominant one an alpha personality
who &apos;s most likely the oldest member of the group .
we believe he could be from out of state
and has likely committed similar crimes before .
the lieutenant will be fiercely loyal to the pack leader .
the alpha demands this .
he probably comes from a broken home
where he felt a loss the dominant was able to fill .
and finally we have the follower
the newest member of the pack .
he hasn &apos;t cemented his loyalty to the alpha
when already he &apos;s starting to question his role in the group .
it &apos;s unlikely this member is privy to the pack leader &apos;s ultimate agenda .
it won &apos;t be long before the dominant realizes the low man is a liability .
we need to find this man before the pack eliminates him .
how do we do that ?
we drive a wedge between them .
amp up the pressure .
this is our best chance of finding stephanie alive .
how do they know where we go to school ?
they &apos;re going to every campus in the area . chill .
no .
i &apos;m out .
no one &apos;s out .
no look ok ?
i &apos;m not gonna tell anyone .
i swear . ok ?
i &apos;m gonna skip town .
just calm down and be smart .
we &apos;ll figure it out .
i can &apos;t .
i just can &apos;t .
you brought him in you fix it .
i come bearing new information .
after i expanded my search nationwide
codis bounced back a dna match to a series of rapes in louisiana .
the dominant &apos;s done it before .
dna matched only one unsub
but there &apos;s another sample in the louisiana cases .
he had partners before .
just not the same ones .
so he moves on when the pack dissolves .
louisiana p.d. were crazy close to solving who done it
but then the rapes stopped . two locals went missing
and they pinned the crimes on them .
i &apos;m sure they didn &apos;t just happen to disappear .
garcia do a search of local colleges
for students from louisiana .
yeah i &apos;m gonna do that . garcia out .
if he &apos;s killed his partners before he &apos;ll do it again .
but if he kills his accomplices
stephanie wilson is as good as gone .
everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
how ?
the feds are closing in on us .
where are we going ?
michael has a plan .
i don &apos;t trust him .
you trust me don &apos;t you ?
yes . i trust you
but ... michael is unpredictable .
how do you not see that ?
i &apos;ve known him a lot longer than you have .
all right ?
have faith .
why are we stopping ?
we &apos;re ditching the truck and skipping town .
so what we &apos;re just gonna leave the truck in the middle of nowhere ?
yep .
who &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s just michael coming to pick us up .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
relax would you .
you ready ?
yes sir .
what the hell man ? !
it &apos;s time you learned a lesson in loyalty scotty .
i thought you were my friend .
what &apos;s this for ?
finish the job .
what are you talking about ? he &apos;s learned his lesson .
lesson &apos;s not his it &apos;s yours .
finish him .
i &apos;m not a killer man .
you are now .
no ...
there &apos;s only one way out the brotherhood .
don &apos;t do that .
no .
don &apos;t do this .
chris i &apos;m your friend .
chris don &apos;t please !
i &apos;m sorry .
please don &apos;t do this !
no no no !
keep it together chris .
stephanie ?
no . male victim .
we managed to i.d. what was left of him .
name &apos;s scott kagan .
he was a sophomore at ernstrom college .
this might be one of our unsubs .
we said they &apos;d eliminate the weakest link
and it looks like he was it .
the pack isn &apos;t just breaking apart
they &apos;re completely collapsing .
rather than kill stephanie wilson
they decided to eliminate one of their own .
i mean how long until the lieutenant realizes
that he &apos;s expendable as well ?
hopefully soon . stephanie may have gained another day
but that &apos;s not gonna last .
we have another problem
that they &apos;ve changed pattern also . we &apos;re 3 counties away
from the normal disposal area .
maybe they saw the patrol cars
at the usual dumping grounds and got spooked .
no not a chance .
my guys were parked at the edge of the field .
no one saw them .
well then maybe they knew about the patrols in advance .
scott kagan looks like a super outcast .
record of marijuana possession in high school
moved on to harder stuff in college .
scott rushed the fraternity kappa iota phi
but was thrown out before he became a full member .
according to his school counselor records
he never really fit in anywhere .
well not for lack of trying .
that &apos;s exactly what made him vulnerable to the alpha .
he didn &apos;t stand a chance . the dominant befriended him
and gave him a place to belong .
garcia we know the pack leader is connected to the rapes
in louisiana . do any students at ernstrom college
match to that area ?
no such lucky .
i have cross @-@ referenced with profile
location and criminal record . i have zilch .
let &apos;s concentrate on the lieutenant .
he &apos;s our local connection .
check the entire state
fort wayne to evansville .
this guy knows the country roads like the back of his hand .
like scott both members were probably rejected
by fraternities or athletic organizations .
their actions must have been
deemed inappropriate to get them kicked out
not just drug offenses but violence as well .
and they knew about the police traps .
at least one of the unsubs is connected to the investigation .
do you think they have an inside man ?
it &apos;s possible .
run background checks on members of the sheriff &apos;s department
civilians and officers alike .
i &apos;d like to speak to the sheriff .
this is sheriff salters .
hello ?
hello is anyone there ?
everything ok ?
yeah .
fine .
who you calling buddy ?
no one .
sheriff &apos;s office .
now why &apos;d you have to go and do something like that ?
sir i need to talk to you guys really really alone .
ok . hang on .
conference room .
go ahead garcia .
i ran a list of police officers
with children who go to ernstrom college
and i cross @-@ referenced
that with my flagged campus violent offenders .
what did you find ?
my apologies sir
but sheriff salters has a son
that goes to ernstrom
and the deeper i dig the more interesting it gets .
it appears young salters has a sealed record .
unseal it .
i already did that .
and it &apos;s blank .
what do you mean ?
everything in it has been erased .
who &apos;d know better that the fbi are here
than someone living with a cop ?
do you think salters knows ?
how could he ?
he &apos;s searching for a leak in his own department
only he &apos;s the leak .
garcia dig up everything you can
on salters and his son .
yes sir .
stay here .
sheriff i need to talk to you .
i &apos;m busy .
then i can come back with a warrant .
your son chris has a sealed record
but i think i know what &apos;s in it .
he &apos;s been arrested for assault and probably drug violations too
and you &apos;ve covered up for him .
that &apos;s why it didn &apos;t turn up in our initial search .
are you a father agent hotchner ?
yes i am .
well then you understand .
i couldn &apos;t let these uh these incidents
ruin chris &apos; future .
i understand that if you run your home
the way you run your department
then you bully your family the way you bully your officers .
i run a tight ship .
how long ago did your wife stop putting up with it and leave you ?
you son of a bitch .
how many times have you hit chris ?
how dare you accuse me of abusing my son !
you call it discipline .
you hit chris in order to maintain control
but you lost that control a long time ago .
has he started to hit you back yet ?
don &apos;t tell me how to raise my son .
you &apos;ve covered up domestic disturbance violations and drug offenses .
have you covered up anything else ?
what are you getting at ?
have you discussed details of the case with chris ?
did you tell him about the checkpoints ?
he was asking me about my day .
that was in order to escape detection .
i &apos;m sorry sheriff your son &apos;s right in the middle of this
and if you don &apos;t help us find him
we &apos;re gonna lose him and stephanie wilson .
hotch he &apos;s not in the dorms and he &apos;s not answering his phone .
you know if salters inflicts physical punishment on chris
then it &apos;s highly unlikely he &apos;s the alpha of the group .
no based on what we know chris wouldn &apos;t be the dominant
nor would he have the confidence to lead .
but if the dominant protected chris ...
he &apos;d have his unwavering loyalty .
sheriff when chris started ernstrom
was there an upperclassman who befriended him
or who he looked up to ?
did he join a fraternity ? did he play on a sports team ?
he didn &apos;t do this .
garcia anything ?
i &apos;m searching sir .
track team .
and kappa iota phi .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been missing .
garcia expand your previous louisiana search
to former ernstrom students
who fit our offender profile .
narrowing narrowing ...
molto bene .
michael kosina of louisiana .
uh let &apos;s see . he was kicked out of kappa iota phi
after questionable sexual conduct with a student in 2004 .
the charges were dropped .
but the incident earned the fraternity probation
from its national chapter .
michael kosina . i met him .
he caused chris &apos; bar fight .
he did this to my son ?
were kosina and chris at ernstrom at the same time ?
yeah . chris was a freshman when he was a senior .
michael dropped out a few weeks later
after he got into an altercation with one of his professors .
this type of dominant
would definitely have issues with authority .
tell me you got an address baby girl .
en route as we flirt baby .
morgan wait until sheriff salters arrives .
he might be able to talk to chris .
all right but you know hotch if that doesn &apos;t work
prentiss could be our best shot .
true . the pack objectifies women .
they wouldn &apos;t know how to handle negotiating with one .
we gotta hit the road .
why ?
they &apos;re getting too close .
no they &apos;re not .
it doesn &apos;t matter . they &apos;re in our heads .
first scott and now you .
you can trust me .
really ?

prentiss go . go .
michael .
chris .
my name &apos;s emily prentiss .
i &apos;m holstering my weapon .
i just want to talk .
that &apos;s what they all say .
that &apos;s quite a feat
manipulating a cop &apos;s son into committing rape and murder .
shouldn &apos;t we be talking about
how your fine ass is gonna get us out of here ?
you wish .
look around .
everyone &apos;s guns are trained on you .
not chris . you .
no one wants to shoot a cop &apos;s kid .
but you ?
i might shoot you myself .
you call yourself a negotiator ?
chris i know you &apos;re loyal to michael . i get it .
he was there for you when you thought nobody else was .
nobody was .
that might be true .
but you need to understand that
michael &apos;s done this before .
don &apos;t listen to this bitch !
she &apos;s trying to get us to surrender .
we should rush them now .
you don &apos;t want to do that chris do you ?
that &apos;s suicide for you .
michael doesn &apos;t care .
he was gonna kill you
the moment things got tough anyway .
just like he killed his last team .
what &apos;s she talking about ?
two men went missing
following a series of rapes
in northern louisiana .
what do you think happened to them ?
is that true ?
were you gonna kill me too ?
what do you mean too ?
i didn &apos;t kill scott .
you did .
you said that it was to protect us .
us me . it &apos;s all the same .
it don &apos;t matter anyway .
we &apos;re not getting out of here either one of us .
i need to know you &apos;re with me .
to the end .

too late .
what did you do ? !
put it down ! put it down !
it &apos;s over christopher .
it &apos;s over .
i am not going to jail .
we &apos;ll get you a good lawyer .
we &apos;ll figure out a way to get your sentence reduced .
you &apos;d like that wouldn &apos;t you dad ?
a chance to play hero .
son ...
well too late .
you don &apos;t get too win this one .
medic we need a medic .
i had to son .
sheriff ?
it &apos;s time for us to go .
you know i keep asking myself what i did wrong .
how did my son become a murderer ?
there &apos;s an answer that a profiler could give you
but you don &apos;t need to hear that .
and you don &apos;t need any criticism from me .
all i can say is that in my own life
i try to run a very tight ship at work
and then when i come home i try to give my son
all the love and compassion
and understanding that he deserves .
and i &apos;m not saying this is your failing
but something made chris vulnerable .
i know i &apos;ve lost him .
i don &apos;t think you have .
it &apos;s going to take every connection i &apos;ve ever had
to keep him off death row .
and after that he &apos;s going to need you more than ever .
chris is lost .
but he doesn &apos;t have to spend the rest of his life that way .
what can i do ?
be there for him .
make amends .
and help him do the same .
good luck .
thank you .
&quot; without heroes we are all plain people
and don &apos;t know how far we can go . &quot;
