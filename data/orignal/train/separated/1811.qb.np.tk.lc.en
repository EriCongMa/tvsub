第十季 第二十一集
&quot; change of heart &quot;
over the past 20 years ,
one of the most valuable tools a doctor has is the algorithm .
your patient &apos;s main complaint goes into a box ...
cristina was supposed to fly out with us this morning ,
and she didn &apos;t show .
... and then the formula helps you decide what to do next .
her phone &apos;s still off .
no , uh , derek , all -- all she said was , &quot; that &apos;s how it goes . &quot;
last night after the ceremony .
and then that smug idiot &apos;s speech
was a 20 @-@ minute ode to himself .
ma &apos;am , we &apos;re shutting the doors .
she &apos;ll just be one second .
his research wasn &apos;t even research .
i read his paper on lymph nodes . it sounded plagiarized .
i &apos;m very sorry , but you &apos;ll need to put your phone away .
i heard you .
uh , i &apos;ll call you when we land .
but what happens when the problem doesn &apos;t fit into a box ?
all right , mama hung up on us .
zola , time to put on your shoes , sweetie .
well ...
you &apos;re suddenly on your own , unexpectedly ,
with about a thousand paths to choose from .
i should have called . i know .
uh -- but if i called , you &apos;d have said no .
and then i wouldn &apos;t get to see how grown up you are .
zola ! wow !
look at you ! what are you , like 16 now ?
and i wanted to meet my nephew . oh .
um ... hello to you , too .
i haven &apos;t talked to you in like two months .
amy , what are you doing here ?
a ... thing happened .
james proposed .
ah ! congratulations .
and i freaked .
i &apos;m sure you did .
just sort of freaked , not -- not flee @-@ the @-@ country freaked .
just ... suddenly ...
there &apos;s the possibility
that i may be facing a different kind of life --
the kind that you and meredith have .
so i thought i would come visit
and see what it &apos;s like and get ... unfreaked .
hopefully .
you &apos;re mad .
no . i &apos;m happy to show you .
hey , zola , auntie amy is gonna play with you and bailey today
while i go to work .
wow . really not mad .
no , i &apos;m excited .
yeah . so , bailey gets a bottle in an hour .
his schedule &apos;s on the refrigerator .
zola likes to stick stuff up her nose ,
so keep an eye on her .
oh . okay .
i &apos;ll see you later .
okay , so , we turkey @-@ baste me in may .
and then the baby &apos;s born in february ?
yep .
sorry . just , uh , need to borrow some toothpaste
as you were .
okay , so , i take off the spring , recover , nurse ,
and then you take off the summer .
mm @-@ hmm . and then i put karev in charge of peds .
i think that that works .
are you sure about that ?
&apos;cause if you &apos;re gone in the summer ,
you &apos;re gone when the new interns start .
you really want karev in charge of all the new kids ?
maybe , maybe push off the insemination to july ?
kepner . kepner .
get out of my vagina .
yes . right .
oh , wow .
it &apos;s really only been two nights ?
&apos;cause it feels like 10 .
no . i &apos;m not gonna have time to pre @-@ round .
screw pre @-@ rounds .
your peds fellow needs a consult .
no ! no , no , no . wait -- wait . you have to work , too .
you &apos;re avoiding something .
less talk , more stuff .
no , alex . i &apos;m serious .
what &apos;s going on ?
i got an offer from lebackes to work at his practice .
it &apos;s a good offer -- a really good offer .
oh ! that &apos;s great !
why don &apos;t you look like it &apos;s great ?
i &apos;m supposed to give them an answer by the end of the day .
oh .
robbins is gonna be so pissed . what am i gonna tell her ?
just be pleasant and confident and firm ,
smile when you talk ,
and just tell her how excited you are
about this great new opportunity .
if she starts making her scary , angry face ,
distract her with a compliment .
that works ? the compliments thing ?
mm @-@ hmm .
god , you &apos;re sexy .
doesn &apos;t work on me .
frankie mcneil , post @-@ op day 2 after lvad implantation .
currently listed status 1a for transplant .
despite the lvad ,
we haven &apos;t been able to reverse her end @-@ organ damage .
the good news is , a heart became available this morning .
we &apos;re just waiting for confirmation from the hospital in oakland .
i &apos;m sorry , but who are you again ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
um , dr. russell is our head of cardiothoracic surgery .
since dr. yang &apos;s not back ,
he &apos;ll be performing frankie &apos;s transplant today .
but dr. yang &apos;s our surgeon .
no offense , but how do we know you &apos;re as good ?
i &apos;m an attending . she &apos;s a fellow .
trust me -- i &apos;m as good .
dr. robbins and i will be in the o.r. the entire time .
frankie &apos;s in good hands .
and link ?
breath sounds are strong ,
and this morning &apos;s echo was all clear ,
and his heart pump is doing everything it should .
link , buddy , that &apos;s great . you &apos;re getting better .
when can ivy come back in here ?
um ...
well , she &apos;s still sick ,
so she needs to stay in there a little bit longer .
unfortunately , ivy &apos;s still in rejection .
unos has her listed as status 1b ,
and we &apos;re monitoring her very closely .
page , when we know the heart &apos;s a go ...
here you go , doctor .
so dr. yang won &apos;t be back today ?
well , i haven &apos;t heard from her ,
and i can &apos;t exactly postpone the surgery .
has any heard from her ?
y-- just make sure that frankie &apos;s ready and prepped .
why are you hovering ?
thank you . what &apos;s wrong with your face ?
i like your hair .
oh , what did you do ?
radiology &apos;s backed up .
can you get me in line for the next available mri ?
sure .
hey , shepherd ,
you &apos;re back to more of a regular surgical schedule , right ?
yes . why ?
the foundation asked me to report on the status
of our surgeon @-@ run research projects --
want to see which ones are actually getting results .
so , what , they can start shutting other ones down ?
neurological research takes a really long time .
i &apos;m looking at all the projects , derek , not just yours .
we can start making these decisions ourselves
or wait for the foundation to do it for us .
remember -- dr. torres and i
have a presidential seal of approval .
you &apos;re back !
you &apos;re gonna want to stay away from me today .
where &apos;s cristina ? she must be devastated .
if i were her , i &apos;d be
face @-@ first in a pile of chocolate @-@ chip cookies .
stop it !
cristina yang doesn &apos;t need your pity !
she was robbed ! and you robbed her !
oh ! i did ?
yes ! you ! you &apos;re an avery by association !
that pack of fools can &apos;t tell their asses from their elbows ,
never mind an award @-@ winning surgeon
versus some half @-@ wit
who tinkers with science kits in his mother &apos;s basement !
i told you to stay away from me today , didn &apos;t i ?
when did all this happen ?
about a month ago .
lebackes approached me .
i &apos;ve been doing work with him on my off time .
he thinks i could make a really good fit .
so you &apos;ve already decided ? you &apos;re leaving ?
no . i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
i mean , my fellowship is almost over , so ...
well , um , when do they need to know by ?
tonight .
what , you &apos;re not gonna yell at me or something ?
frankie &apos;s heart is on its way .
see , we -- we just don &apos;t understand .
two days ago , he was fine ,
and now he &apos;s struggling to even breathe .
you gave him chemo last night .
is that what &apos;s making him so much sicker ?
i mean , i know it has something to do with the gene therapy .
well , the chemo obliterated the bone marrow ,
which contained the enzyme @-@ deficient cells .
such a mild dose wouldn &apos;t make him sick .
we believe he picked up a viral infection .
how ? ! he &apos;s in isolation !
he -- he has no contact with anyone .
how is that possible ?
your son has no immune system .
we @-@ we &apos;ve taken every precaution , but this is a hospital .
look at him ! he &apos;s barely alive !
maybe we should just stop everything ...
yes .
... and let him get better , just let him rest .
remember , we went through this .
he could get sicker before he got better .
we &apos;re still on track for this afternoon .
when you inject an hiv virus into our very @-@ sick little boy .
inject a deactivated hiv --
o @-@ o @-@ okay , look , look ,
we just need to hang on a little while longer .
we &apos;re almost there .
braden .
let &apos;s give this kid a new heart , shall we ?
10 blade .
i &apos;ve got it , dr. russell .
yang !
this is a surprise . when &apos;d you get back ?
thank you for covering , russell ,
but i &apos;ve got it from here .
i &apos;m already scrubbed and ready to go .
why don &apos;t you take a load off ? you must be tired .
i &apos;ve followed frankie mcneil since day 1 . thank you .
tough loss last night , yang .
must have stung .
better luck next time .
it was an honor just to be nominated .
10 blade .
what on earth are you doing here ? !
i like to keep you guessing .
you better get in here
before i do something that will embarrass henry .
mm . i should surprise you more often .
well , i &apos;m not that surprised .
how come ?
i thought you might show up and poke around ,
trying to figure out why dr. yang didn &apos;t get her award .
oh , please . i planned this trip a long time ago .
i figured you &apos;d be exhausted from the ceremony
and need a little getaway .
you didn &apos;t plan it as a victory lap
to celebrate yang &apos;s big win ?
mm ... that would have been a nice feature .
mm . yeah .
but i think the weekend will have other nice features .
oh . really ?
so , why don &apos;t you finish what you &apos;re doing ?
i &apos;ll sit here and watch the magic ,
and then i &apos;ll take you to dinner .
yes , dr. webber .
hey .
hi . how are you ?
good .
how &apos;d you sleep ?
fine , thanks .
have you talked to cristina ? is she okay ?
i really thought that she had --
yeah , i @-@ i know . i was shocked , too .
um , so ... i need to come home tonight .
you want to talk ?
i ...
i need my ipod .
i went running today , and i wished -- - sure . sure .
are you okay ?
you look -- - stressed . i &apos;m a little stressed .
i got to compile a report for the foundation
on the value of people &apos;s research projects ,
&apos;cause we &apos;re not gonna be able to
keep all of them , i don &apos;t think .
what ?
you guys deny her the award and not 24 hours later .
you &apos;re talking about shutting down her research ?
you know that that was , like , her life &apos;s dream , right ?
that &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing .
they &apos;re looking for ways to --
classy move , avery family .
way to make it all about the medicine .
okay . what do we got ?
sam roane , 23 --
been walking cross @-@ country for the past three months ,
stopping only for sleep
and the pickup that took him out .
hypotensive with multiple blunt trauma
and deformity to the right lower extremity .
paramedics splinted him in the field .
so , three months ? that means you started walking from ...
wilmington .
were you , uh , walking for charity ?
no . i mean , i fell in with a few cancer groups along the way ,
you know , for the snacks ,
but it was more about really committing to something
and following it through to the end .
and then i got hit by a truck .
okay , the femur fracture must
have transected the femoral artery .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s so hypotensive .
he is losing all his blood volume into his thigh .
foot is pulseless and cold .
we need to do an angio in the o.r. let &apos;s move now .
i mean , they screwed her !
and i was ready to make a scene ,
but she just sat there in her seat .
she clapped for him . she applauded him , derek !
no , go ahead . get it out .
and now i can &apos;t even get ahold of her .
i mean , she could still be in boston .
she could be in mexico . i have no idea where --
she &apos;s in o.r. 1 . thank god !
is that a spinal schwannoma ?
it is .
extended into the retropleural space ?
mm @-@ hmm .
is that for me ?
we &apos;re overdue for a date .
o.r. 3 , you in fresh scrubs , me in a ferry @-@ boat scrub cap .
you in ?
well , this could take hours . what about the kids ?
amy &apos;s with them .
we have a babysitter named amy ?
amy my sister .
the junkie ?
she &apos;s a recovering addict , and she loves kids .
i &apos;ve only been gone a day .
the tumor involves the great vessels .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
mm @-@ hmm .
and it &apos;s working .
mm @-@ hmm .
yeah , his femur &apos;s toast . he &apos;ll need an ex @-@ fix .
sfa &apos;s transected .
okay . we got to relieve the pressure on this leg .
i just heard from grey --
cristina &apos;s in o.r. 1 , doing a heart transplant .
karev and robbins are with her .
hey , wilson , did you happen
to put on boot covers before you came in here ?
why would i --
okay . i get it .
it &apos;s in my socks .
oh ! that never gets old .
i just feel like it &apos;s one thing after another , after another .
i don &apos;t know how you do it with three sick kids .
i &apos;m barely keeping it together with just one .
teresa ?
hm ?
uh , do you have those consent forms for this afternoon ?
oh . yeah , i forgot . hang on .
yeah . take your time .
i mean , you &apos;re their parent . you &apos;re who they trust .
but you can &apos;t actually help them .
that &apos;s the doctor &apos;s job .
then weeks go by , and all this ... stuff
that &apos;s supposed to be making them better
keeps not working .
and i just -- i start to wonder ,
&quot; do these doctors really know what &apos;s best for my kids ?
&quot; am i just kidding myself ?
will we ever go home ? &quot;
sorry , doctor . no offense .
nope . none taken .
uh , teresa , i &apos;m sorry .
you just have a couple more to sign .
removing cross clamp to re @-@ establish blood flow .
i don &apos;t see one tear , one leak . you did it perfectly .
i mean , i &apos;ve really never seen such an efficient anastomosis .
look , karev .
awesome job , yang .
inspiring .
flawless .
charge it to 20 .
should be pumping any minute now .
how long does it take ?
usually , it &apos;s pretty much right after restoring blood flow ,
so eyes on the field .
this is not something you want to miss
on your first transplant .
so ...
shouldn &apos;t it be contracting by now ?
dr. yang ?
starting cardiac massage .
pacing wires now . get me intracardiac epi .
come on , come on , come on . beat .
what &apos;s unos saying ?
we &apos;re waiting on a call back .
i don &apos;t understand . how does that happen ?
they sent us a freaking lemon heart .
they must have injured
it when they were moving it from the donor .
it &apos;s unos . they &apos;ve located another heart that &apos;s a match .
it &apos;s in portland .
how often does that happen ?
karev and i will go get it . we can &apos;t risk another screw @-@ up .
well , both of us don &apos;t need to -- - now . let &apos;s go .
cristina , you okay ?
yeah .
dr. yang , frankie &apos;s already been on bypass for hours .
and she &apos;s gonna stay on it . keep monitoring her .
page me if anything changes .
all right .
that &apos;s it .
shall we ?
you really thought i would come here
and question why yang didn &apos;t get a harper avery ?
well , you &apos;re a proud papa . she &apos;s your prize student .
i know it &apos;s important to you .
i @-@ it &apos;s important to the whole hospital .
and you &apos;re an investor in that hospital ,
so i think it &apos;d be important to you , too .
it is .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s good that there is an impartial committee .
well ...
&quot; well &quot; what ?
it &apos;s not that impartial .
look , it makes no sense that she lost .
see , i read her paper , i read every other nominated paper .
there &apos;s no comparison --
unless there was some statistical calculation she blew ,
some gross error buried way down in the data .
you know as well as i do
none of them even holds a candle to what yang &apos;s been doing .
number one , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re alive .
number two , who do you want me to go after ?
because i &apos;m in your corner .
mer .
but i can &apos;t be in your
corner if you disappear on me .
mer , not now .
dr. yang , they &apos;re asking for you in the ccu .
ivy mcnell &apos;s sats dropped below 70 .
dr. yang . you &apos;re back . thank god .
ivy &apos;s heart is failing .
she has a lot of fluid in her lungs .
i need to intubate right away .
prepare for rsi with 15 of etomidate and 10 of vec .
link . link , don &apos;t look , buddy .
i &apos;m here , honey .
push etomidate .
i barely got two words out of her .
she &apos;s obviously not okay , right ?
you said she got pulled into an emergency .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s fine .
you know , this is the most time we &apos;ve spent together ,
just the two of us , in weeks .
it &apos;s really nice .
we have to do it more often .
grey ?
should have left a tie on the door .
about your portal vein project --
do you really need lab staff five days a week ?
yes . say yes .
yes . why ?
the foundation is trimming research .
what ? !
no , no , no . they &apos;re just looking ...
the hell they are .
the harper avery foundation
doesn &apos;t make any decisions about this hospital .
if there &apos;s one thing
the harper avery foundation can &apos;t do well ,
it &apos;s decide who should get something .
okay , i am just --
tell them that if they cut my funding ,
i cut their tires .
cristina yang deserved that award ,
not dr. nobody sucks @-@ a @-@ lot from hopkins .
and tell them in short sentences with little , tiny words ,
because they are boneheads !
and we were having so much fun .
jackson and i aren &apos;t having just a fight .
this is important -- it &apos;s not something
that can be just glossed over , ignored , or fixed .
it -- i can &apos;t pretend like nothing &apos;s wrong .
yeah , i know . i know .
you said all that last night ,
then again this morning over breakfast .
and now -- you &apos;re saying it all again now .
hey . wow . look at that .
his ex @-@ fix really looks ready to go .
sadly , i think our work is done here .
w @-@ w @-@ wha-- y @-@ y @-@ y @-@ you &apos;re leaving ? y @-@ you &apos;re not leaving .
don &apos;t we need to review the measurements with imaging ?
no , we do . we do . uh , it &apos;s just --
we should really stay out of kepner and hunt &apos;s way ,
so we &apos;re gonna do it in radiology ,
where there are bigger screens and better lighting . sound good ?
well , we &apos;re almost done here , so ...
n-- take your time . let &apos;s go , wilson .
we should take him home ! let him get better !
let this treatment get more established !
we don &apos;t have to be the guinea pig !
but the treatment can bring us our son back .
he can live a normal life .
or it could kill him !
they say it won &apos;t , but this therapy
is made with hiv .
that doesn &apos;t freak you out ?
it &apos;s deactivated !
do you even know what that means ? !
do you know what that means ?
excuse me . i need to do one final blood test on braden .
no ! no more blood draws ! no more injections !
nothing else ! we &apos;re done !
this treatment is too much ! it &apos;s killing him !
okay , teresa , look , i know that you &apos;re scared .
teresa ...
no , tell dr. bailey we have changed our minds .
you &apos;re not injecting braden with anything today . you got it ?
the last time that we were on a plane --
can we not talk about the last time you were on a plane ?
no .
alex , the last time that we were on a plane together --
the first time we met .
look , i know you brought me on this plane
to talk me out of taking this job .
we &apos;ll be in portland soon .
just get it over with and say what you &apos;re gonna say .
it &apos;s not like we can go anywhere .
we were on our way to pick up a liver
and a small bowel for a 10 @-@ year @-@ old --
and now you think i &apos;m selling out ,
that i &apos;m choosing money over substance ,
and that it &apos;s a waste of my talent or whatever --
that there &apos;s more to life
than nice schedules and a big , fat paycheck .
well , i &apos;ve thought about it hard .
you &apos;ve been awesome , but i &apos;ve already stayed here once for you .
i have to start thinking about myself , about what i want .
i &apos;ve worked hard , and i deserve this .
i deserve to think about myself for once , okay ?
yang is a robot .
if i just lost the harper avery ,
i &apos;d be awol ,
in my bed with a bottle of scotch .
although , she did just throw pickups across a crowded o.r.
yang &apos;s a surgeon .
she cares more about her patients than stupid awards .
what &apos;s the latest a.b.g. ?
uh , ph is 7.15,
pco2 is 52 .
crap . she &apos;s acidotic .
push bicarb and increase her sweep .
okay . okay , good . good .
shane , she &apos;s bleeding .
it &apos;s coming from one of the suture lines .
page dr. yang now !
ivy &apos;s lungs are doing better after the intubation ,
but i need to place a special line
to get a more accurate measurement of her heart .
you may want to leave during this procedure .
no . i &apos;m staying . i want to stay .
you ran in here after frankie &apos;s surgery . is she --
there was a ... complication with frankie &apos;s donor heart ,
but a second one has been located ,
and it &apos;s on its way .
i just wanted to keep frankie in the o.r. until it arrives .
what ? is -- is that safe ? is she gonna be okay ?
she &apos;s being closely monitored .
dr. yang ,
dr. ross and dr. murphy are on the phone from o.r. 1 .
put them on speaker .
ross , update me .
i &apos;m here with frankie &apos;s dad .
frankie &apos;s bleeding from one of her suture lines .
and she &apos;s really acidotic .
john , you should step out .
i &apos;m staying .
ross , did you push bicarb ?
we did .
how are her coags ?
stable , but this bleed isn &apos;t slowing down .
okay , well , you need to stop that bleeding .
if she continues to bleed --
the triad of death -- we know .
i &apos;m so sorry , sir .
okay , throw a horizontal mattress stitch ,
but careful with her tissues .
they &apos;re extremely friable , so soft hands .
you &apos;re on the right side of the table .
you have one chance ,
or else you could rip through the aorta ,
which is essential
connecting the new heart when it arrives .
nope .
just take a breath , just throw the stitch .
you can do this .
i &apos;ve never put a horizontal mattress
in an aorta before -- only in a bowel .
from this side , i &apos;ll just tear through her native aorta .
well , what if i tear through it ?
you won &apos;t !
you can do this .
ross ! murphy !
we got it . we stopped the bleed .
she &apos;s fine .
they &apos;re both fine .
she gets results .
she always has , and this is no exception .
m @-@ make me understand ,
because my read is that yang should have clearly won .
i mean , what am i missing ?
from where i &apos;m standing , she had it by a mile .
richard , honestly , tell me you &apos;re not this naive .
well , what is that supposed to mean ?
the harper avery foundation
co @-@ owns the hospital cristina yang works for .
she could never win that award .
i don &apos;t know how long this stitch is gonna hold .
ph and bicarb ?
7.0 and 14 .
dr. yang , now she &apos;s oozing from the ivc .
i see it , shane .
aren &apos;t we gonna put in a suture ?
if we just keep throwing in stitches ,
she &apos;ll dissect all over the place .
we have to get frankie off this table .
how ? she &apos;s getting a transplant in this state .
she &apos;ll never survive it .
first , she gets a lemon heart ,
and now we don &apos;t know if the new one &apos;s gonna make it ?
wait . is that robbins ?
how we doing ?
the heart is out , and we &apos;re on the move .
want to let the coordinator know ?
oh . phone the pilot . let him know we &apos;re on our way .
so , this is how it &apos;s gonna be now ?
radio silence till the end of my fellowship ?
that &apos;s how you &apos;re gonna leave things ?
alex , i brought you here today
because i trusted your skills to properly procure this heart .
and then we got on that plane , and i started feeling sad
because you &apos;re leaving soon and i will miss you .
i didn &apos;t bring you today to scold you .
i &apos;m proud of you and i &apos;m happy for you ,
and all i wanted was to share a freaking memory , okay ?
i was being sentimental !
you know , if i take the job ,
i &apos;m still gonna have hospital privileges .
you &apos;ll see me around .
shut up , karev . moment &apos;s ruined .
just a few more sutures .
you know where he was when he got hit ?
he was crossing highway 519 .
he could see the water .
all he wanted to do was walk from ocean to ocean .
he was just so freaking close .
okay , let &apos;s check the pulse .
it &apos;s not fair , you know ?
you make a commitment , it &apos;s supposed to mean something ,
and then a ... pickup truck just takes you out .
hey , you okay ?
s-- sorry .
i just f @-@ feel like
this fight with jackson is , like , the fight ,
and i ...
i don &apos;t know how we recover from it .
listen .
some fights , you just can &apos;t get past .
you know ?
like me and cristina , it was -- it was about kids .
you and avery ?
this is your first fight .
you will get past this ,
and then something else will come along ,
and you &apos;ll fight about that , too .
and you guys will recover every time .
this is not your pickup truck .
now that it &apos;s thawed ,
and i &apos;ve added the virus to the culture ,
i just have to wash them down and give him the injection
within the next four to six hours ,
and then , theoretically ,
that &apos;s when the magic will happen .
see , that &apos;s the problem , though , bailey .
so far , all of this is theoretical ,
and the foundation needs actual results .
i need you to help me out , okay ?
give me something , anything concrete ,
that shows that your project is producing results .
no , d-- it will be .
once i give this targeted gene therapy to my bubble boy ,
i know it will .
i @-@ i can feel it .
okay , i can &apos;t exactly pitch that we need to keep your lab
because you have a feeling , can i ?
you said you &apos;re doing this today ?
yes , i am .
and it &apos;s going to work .
dr. bailey , do you have a minute ?
you pursued her . you encouraged her .
you all but told her she was a front runner ,
when you knew she was nothing but window dressing .
she was not window dressing !
she was nominated for a prestigious award
that brought publicity to her and the hospital .
you used her !
she was never gonna win that damn thing for a second .
nobody from grey @-@ sloan memorial
will ever win a harper avery , will they -- ever ?
do you want me to remind you
why there is a grey @-@ sloan memorial hospital ?
or should i just take my $ 24 million and go home ?
what draws me to you , richard , is your idealism .
i find it extremely attractive .
but this is business .
and i do not appreciate
your coming all the way across the country
to harangue me about the fact
that your prize pony didn &apos;t get a ribbon !
and if it makes you feel better ...
she had the votes .
are you that naive ?
catherine , do you really think that &apos;s why i came all this way ,
why i planned an entire weekend with the things that you love ?
richard ...
i made reservations at cipriani &apos;s
because i know you love it there .
and i was going to wait until just before dessert
and the waiter was gonna bring you a glass of champagne ,
and i was going to tell you how much i love you
and how right for one another we are ,
how you make me feel excited to be alive ,
how you give me a reason to get up each morning
and say a thankful prayer every night .
i was gonna ask you to be by my side
for the rest of our lives .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
that &apos;s why i came .
and now i &apos;m leaving .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . what ?
you &apos;re gonna have to say --
you &apos;re gonna have to say it all again .
dr. robbins is on her way with a new heart for frankie ,
but ivy &apos;s deterioration has caused her
to shoot up to the top of the transplant list , too .
ivy is also a perfect match for the donor heart en route .
but t @-@ that &apos;s frankie &apos;s heart .
officially , yes , but ...
under the circumstances , the heart could be redirected .
to ivy ?
you w-- you want to give frankie &apos;s heart to ivy ?
no , i don &apos;t want --
medically speaking ,
frankie &apos;s condition is declining rapidly .
technically , ivy is more stable ,
which would give the heart a better chance of survival .
wait . just --
but -- b @-@ b @-@ but if frankie &apos;s worse ,
don &apos;t you have to give the heart to the one that &apos;s the worst ?
unless she thinks it &apos;s a waste .
you think the heart will be wasted on frankie ?
i just want to explain all your options .
our options ? this is our decision ?
we &apos;re -- you &apos;re asking us to choose ?
you want us to try to pick
which of our children gets a heart
and which one doesn &apos;t ?
frankie can be fitted with a total artificial heart for now .
we can &apos;t choose . you have to do it .
we have three children , dr. yang --
three ... amazing ...
beautiful , kind children .
and we can &apos;t --
we can &apos;t try and pick between two of them .
we won &apos;t .
you have to make this decision .
please .
please .
there you are .
frankie &apos;s heart is as stiff as a rock ,
and ivy &apos;s got global systolic dysfunction .
it &apos;s absolutely impossible .
why didn &apos;t you call me ?
mer already yelled at me about this .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ? i just --
i wanted to be alone , so i left .
i &apos;m not talking about --
i just heard about the mcneils .
you should have called me to help you make this decision .
no surgeon should have to make a decision like this on their own .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here . that &apos;s why you have a chief of surgery .
they &apos;re my patients . i know their status .
i can decide this .
but you don &apos;t have to .
yes , i do .
prepare to start sectioning off the vessels .
is that a gustafson artificial heart ?
we &apos;re getting frankie off this table immediately .
and the heart that &apos;s on its way ?
we &apos;re reallocating that heart . it &apos;s going to ivy .
russell &apos;s prepping her now .
okay , let &apos;s move .
you guys gonna be home for dinner ?
yeah . sure . sounds good .
okay , awesome ! can &apos;t wait !
yeah , neither can we .
does that mean what i think it means
that there &apos;s gonna be dinner waiting for us
on our dining room table when we get home ?
have we ever even used our dining room table ?
just remind me to thank my sister
for letting me actually spend an entire day with my wife .
well , she &apos;s not a permanent solution .
ah , not yet , but we have a spare bedroom .
we could give her surgical privileges .
that would give her less time for childcare .
i know it &apos;s not permanent ,
but we spent an entire day without dropping any balls .
you know , maybe she &apos;ll even put the kids to bed .
maybe we could have some wine .
you know , amy is making dinner for the kids ,
maybe we have time for a little mm @-@ mm .
it would be a shame to end such a great day with no dessert .
why aren &apos;t you trying to talk me into staying ?
oh , god . are we still on this ?
can &apos;t we just focus
on transplanting the heart we just retrieved ?
yeah . never mind . i &apos;ll shut up .
of course i want you to stay .
but this sounds like an incredible job opportunity ,
and you &apos;re right -- you did stay here for me once ,
and i don &apos;t want to stand in your way again ,
so if you want to leave , you should leave --
but not because of something that i do or don &apos;t say ,
you should leave
because this is the next best thing for you
and because you &apos;re excited about this job
and you &apos;re ready to go do great things
and collect a big , fat paycheck .
really big .
i guess you have a decision to make .
don &apos;t screw this one up .
okay , let &apos;s transport her .
b.p. &apos; s stable .
i &apos;m gonna see how russell &apos;s doing with ivy .
bring in the bed .
what happened ?
ventricular pressure &apos;s up to 200 .
she &apos;s dissecting .
now she &apos;s plummeted to 15 . what the hell ?
damn it . it -- it ruptured .
okay , we &apos;re gonna have to reopen her .
staple remover !
i mean , the thing i don &apos;t understand is ,
won &apos;t braden die if he doesn &apos;t get this treatment ?
it &apos;s possible .
so ...
does this happen often with experimental treatments ?
that the parents or the guardians
just withdraw their consent ?
please stop talking .
and then what do i do
with these consent forms she just signed ?
i mean , do i -- do i shred them ? do i toss them ?
i told you -- stop talking !
uh , i &apos;ll take care of those .
just get one damn suture to hold .
how &apos;s her ventricular pressure ?
zero . - pupils ?
fixed and nonreactive .
cristina .
what ? !
cristina , we &apos;ve been at this for almost an hour .
ivy &apos;s transplant went perfectly .
her post @-@ op echo is completely normal .
she should be awake soon .
and frankie ?
no .
no !
i @-@ it can &apos;t be .
you ...
well , how -- how the hell did this ...
we trusted you !
what the hell did you do to our child ? !
we are so sorry for your loss .
oh , god !
we need to be with our kids .
your stitch held .
so ?
i &apos;ve never seen vessels that friable ,
and i &apos;ve been around a lot of diseased hearts .
you did an amazing thing .
shane , the kid died .
it wasn &apos;t anything you did .
they want us to be the center of innovation ,
but they don &apos;t want to pay for it .
they love it when we innovate .
they nominated yang for an award .
she was robbed . they &apos;re boneheads .
we can &apos;t give with one hand and take with the other .
we have to stop this .
there &apos;s no stopping this . guys , they own the place .
we are just their managing board .
this conversation is our relationship now .
best we can do is try to guide them
to make the right decision .
that &apos;s by making our own decision ,
as tough as that might be .
look , this is my report , all right ?
all the projects are here --
operating budgets versus progress to date .
best to worst .
take a look , but the decision is pretty clear to me .
uh , y @-@ you got a second ?
never mind . i &apos;ll come back .
no , no . alex , come in .
you okay ?
i , uh , just wanted to let you know
that , uh , my fellowship is , uh , almost done ,
and , uh ... well , i got an offer
from lebackes pediatric surgery clinic ,
oliver lebackes &apos; practice ,
and , uh ...
well , i gave it some serious consideration ,
and i &apos;ve decided to take it .
so , i guess this is my notice .
cristina , please don &apos;t disappear on me again .
where are you ?
please , just ... call me .
hunt . we need to talk .
if it can wait , i really --
no , it can &apos;t .
well ?
i almost didn &apos;t go through with it .
but ... then i did .
and i think it &apos;s gonna be good , right ?
are you kidding ? ! it &apos;s gonna be awesome !
baby !
compartment syndrome ?
yes . blood went everywhere .
torres loves that trick .
you should just toss those .
i know . you &apos;re right .
why am i scrubbing those nasty things ,
when now you can afford to buy me new ones ?
what happened ?
wait . where are the kids ?
they &apos;re asleep -- totally fine .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i can &apos;t do this .
the children broke your sister .
no , it &apos;s not them .
i didn &apos;t come here to see how your perfect life worked .
i came to see if i could do it --
the whole freaking thing ,
the kids and marriage and the full @-@ time careers --
because i want that ... with james .
and i am wrecked after one day .
it goes on the list of things that i suck at because ...
i can &apos;t .
well , i knew that was too good to be true .
why don &apos;t you go fix your sister ?
i &apos;ll order takeout .
so , you are ...
right .
uh , i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
april .
i said a lot of things the other night that i regret .
and i &apos;m sorry that i hurt your feelings .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
good . so come home . stay .
this is a conversation we &apos;re always gonna have to have .
it &apos;s a part of who we are . it &apos;s gonna take some talking .
but we got married . we love each other .
we made vows to push through this sort of thing .
i know .
i love you , too , and we made a commitment .
and if you believe in god , then you believe he made me --
your husband ...
who shares your values , which i do .
i believe we shouldn &apos;t kill or steal .
i believe that you should be truthful .
i believe that you should treat others
the way you want to be treated .
i agree .
so , then , we can push through this problem .
at our core , we believe the same things .
until i think about telling our children
how unbelievably loved they are
by the creator of the universe , who also made them ,
and i can just see you standing there ,
judging and dismissive , and i just can &apos;t get past it .
can we please just take a break
from our hypothetical children for --
no , we can &apos;t , because they &apos;re not hypothetical anymore .
jackson , i &apos;m pregnant .
so , what do you do ?
how do you decide ?
when you &apos;re left in the dark ?
how do you make sure
you &apos;re not making the worst mistake of someone &apos;s life ?
so , now what ?
we just ... cross our fingers and hope he gets better ?
guess so .
good night , edwards .
you close your eyes ...
... you block out everyone and everything around you ...
cristina ?
cristina ?
cristina ?
are you okay ?
cristina , they were very sick kids .
every one of them
would have been looking at a death sentence without you .
the fact that any of them survived --
i know this , owen .
frankie was on borrowed time
from the moment she got here .
you made the right decision . you made the right call .
i know i made the right call . you don &apos;t have to tell me .
it was an impossible decision , and i stand by it .
i did everything ...
exactly as i was supposed to .
i did it perfectly .
so what is wrong ?
what &apos;s the point , owen ?
what &apos;s the point of anything ?
you won .
the harper avery -- you got the most votes .
richard just told me .
the politics screwed you .
the foundation &apos;s relationship with us -- they used you .
you never stood a chance .
... and pray that the voice inside you ...
... is right .
because once you &apos;ve decided ...
