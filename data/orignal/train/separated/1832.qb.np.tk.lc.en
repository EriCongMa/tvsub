number one rule of surgery
is limit exposure .
good .
keep your hands clean ,
your incisions small
and your wounds covered .
i &apos;ve removed the tumor
and placed the catheters .
now i &apos;m going to flood the abdomen with heated chemo .
it allows a greater concentration of drugs
to be delivered directly to the affected area .
and the heat helps target the cancer cells
while leaving the normal cells virtually unaffected .
okay , start perfusion .
okay , uh , we &apos;ll place him in trendelenburg .
then reverse trendelenburg
as we agitate the abdomen
to make sure that the chemo really washes everywhere .
okay , she saw me . now i can go .
she &apos;s just getting started .
yeah , i have a headache . i need coffee .
i have a cure for a headache that doesn &apos;t involve coffee .
oh , hey . i &apos;m leaving . there &apos;s a seat right there .
oh , thanks .
okay . oh , yeah .
i &apos;ve never seen a hot chemo lavage before .
it &apos;s fascinating .
i thought you were leaving .
the chief asked me to finish out my contract ,
which has a few more weeks .
number two rule of surgery ...
is when rule number one stops working ...
try something else ...
what i said , i didn &apos;t mean .
you mean offering to trade owen like a horse
or a baseball card
or--or a stale peanut butter sandwich
from your lunch box .
it was thoughtless--
fine .
fine .
cristina , let &apos;s just forget about it .
because sometimes you can &apos;t limit exposure .
sometimes the injury is so bad
that you have to cut and cut big .
no !
yes !
no . if you report him--
he &apos;s an alcoholic !
if you report him , it &apos;ll be the end of his career .
you don &apos;t give people any room .
flaws are unacceptable to mcdreamy .
don &apos;t &quot; mcdreamy &quot; me .
mcdreamy is being mcass .
he is an alcoholic . how long has he been drinking ?
since the holidays ?
what , do you want to take notes
so you can show to the board .
so they can offer you his job on the spot ?
you want his job . you know it and i know it .
i &apos;m the head of neurosurgery
i have a responsibility to this hospital .
admit you want to be chief .
all right. you know what ? i &apos;m done having this argument .
i &apos;m going to the board . i &apos;m reporting richard .
post @-@ it .
you can &apos;t call post @-@ it .
i am calling post @-@ it
because i told my secret about my friend to my husband--
not the head of neurosurgery , my husband--
which i have to be able to do .
so the laws of post @-@ it clearly prevail .
this is wrong .
post @-@ it .
the chief--
post @-@ it .
fine . i won &apos;t tell .
fine .
damn it . you just make me want to ...
oh , izzie &apos;s coming home .
i have to tell alex .
i won &apos;t go to the board .
i won &apos;t say a word .
just think about what i said .
okay .
alex , izzie &apos;s ...
coming ...
izzie &apos;s coming ?
home .
oh , crap .
izzie leaves , and mark gets a kid ,
and you two decide that the best way to deal
is to get drunk and mash your genitals together ?
look , in no freaking way
you get to judge us or give relationship advice .
besides , you were a total dirty mistress ,
like , two weeks ago .
are we calling me a dirty mistress ?
that was two years ago ,
and his wife didn &apos;t have cancer .
because i &apos;ve only been with , like ,
six guys in my whole life .
okay , alex and i-- we &apos;ve done it before .
that was recycling .
it was , like , good for the environment .
izzie &apos;s gone , i was horny , she was there .
oh , crap . i am a dirty mistress . oh , god .
you &apos;re gonna tell derek , and then derek &apos;s
gonna tell mark that i &apos;m a whore .
no , i am not going to tell derek ,
and neither are you , and you &apos;re not gonna say anything .
we are keeping our mouths shut .
izzie is coming home .
no one needs to know .
hi . know what ?
坦诚相对
there were no sterile supplies in the o.r. last night .
i heard .
surgery came to a complete stop for a full hour .
central supply and maintenance are understaffed ,
and the autoclaves have been breaking down .
now anything else ?
richard ...
i want to help .
look , i don &apos;t need your help , derek .
the sterilizers are up and running , so--
not the hospital .
you .
you stopped operating .
you &apos;re not teaching anybody but meredith .
i &apos;m wondering if ...
if you need some help .
no shame in asking . you know that .
you can help ...
by doing your own job
and letting me do mine .
anything else ?
no . i &apos;m done .
so i went to the , uh , to the trailer .
yeah , i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t live in the trailer anymore .
yeah .
so ...
meredith called me and told me you might be moving on .
iz--
okay , just ... just wait .
i realize now
that i was wrong to blame you for getting fired .
i &apos;m sorry . it wasn &apos;t your fault . i ju--
i don &apos;t want to have some big talk .
look , i gotta go to work .
i have a pet @-@ scan later ,
so maybe i &apos;ll see you at the hospital ?
is everything okay ?
yeah . yeah .
i found some residencies with open spots and applied .
they all just want to make sure i &apos;m stable .
one of them is close .
it &apos;s in tacoma , so ...
we &apos;d be okay .
i could commute from here and ...
i know that you don &apos;t want to have some big talk ,
but i just can &apos;t leave here--
look , seriously , i have to get to the hospital
the place really sucks these days .
you should be happy you don &apos;t work there anymore .
sorry .
don &apos;t be . i am happy .
i &apos;m gonna work in tacoma , and it &apos;s gonna be awesome .
you &apos;re gonna be jealous .
you are operating ?
i am
a whipple . that &apos;s big .
i say , go big ...
or go home .
uh , excuse me , sir ?
you &apos;re--you &apos;re taking dr.bailey &apos;s whipple ?
is that a problem ?
no , not at all . no , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m the resident on the case .
i &apos;m thrilled to be assisting you .
i @-@ i will be assisting you , right ?
you can open . that way , dr. grey will be fresh
when she dissects the neck of the pancreas
from the portal vein .
that &apos;s the hardest part .
that &apos;s a fifth @-@ year procedure .
it &apos;s what we &apos;ve been practicing .
and i &apos;m telling you , you &apos;re ready .
but if you don &apos;t think you &apos;re ready--
no , no . i &apos;m ready . i &apos;m ready .
what &apos;s going on ?
hunt &apos;s got an m.v.c. in here .
use a hand ?
what ?
can i help ?
you know what you can
do first . you can make that stop !
dude ! stop singing !
i &apos;m trying to get you people the seriousness of the problem .
i &apos;ve lost my upper register completely .
dr. karev , this is mr. mafrici ,
your consult .
i just need some antibiotics .
i open in &quot; tosca &quot; in a week ,
and he gave me bronchitis .
i did not give this to you .
take a deep breath .
he teaches piano to children .
i can hear them hacking away during their lessons ,
and then he comes in the house and touches things .
stop talking . he &apos;s got decreased breath sounds on the left side
he &apos;s gonna need an x @-@ ray .
can you take him up ?
page an intern . i don &apos;t have time .
hunt took him up ,
said thanks for your help .
you got time now ?
you &apos;re hot. mm .
you &apos;re hot , too .
no , you &apos;re ... &quot; hot &quot; hot .
oh , okay , thanks .
no , no , no , you have a fever .
you have a--you have a-- you have a fever .
what is that ?
what ?
oh , my god .
what ?
pox . pox . you have chickenpox .
teddy ... turns out she loves owen
and thought she came here to be all , you know ,
&quot; teddy and owen , &quot; but there &apos;s me ,
and now she &apos;s all pain and threatening to leave ,
and so i told her she could have him .
what ?
she &apos;s an amazing teacher , and i &apos;m ,
you know , i &apos;m happy again , and i &apos;m--i &apos;m in the o.r.
and i &apos;m feeling like myself and--and i--
and , of course , i didn &apos;t mean it .
i mean , i love owen . i @-@ i love him .
but that means that i don &apos;t get to have her ,
so ... maybe i meant it ?
okay , here &apos;s the thing--- you can &apos;t talk like this .
it &apos;s , like , i get you ...
yeah .
but other people don &apos;t , so you can &apos;t talk like this .
i @-@ i mean , it &apos;s--it &apos;s crazy .
it &apos;s , like , um , if you tell someone their baby is ugly .
you know , they know it , you know it , everybody knows it ,
but you don &apos;t talk about it .
okay , but--but you &apos;re saying surgery , right ?
gun to your head , you would choose surgery over derek ?
i am saying don &apos;t talk about this .
and don &apos;t talk about it to owen .
w--oh , little grey ?
that &apos;s the world @-@ class specialist you wanted me to see ?
okay , little grey has had the chicken pox vaccine
i snooped through your personnel file . i , on the other hand ,
have not , nor did i ever have them as a child .
you &apos;re a pediatrician . how have you never had the--
no , i am a pediatric surgeon .
i don &apos;t do little diseases on little people .
i do big surgeries on little people .
oh , you know what ? this is ridiculous . i &apos;m going home .
no , no , no . hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
you &apos;re highly contagious right now .
you leave this room , and you &apos;re gonna touch doorknobs
and elevator buttons , and then you &apos;ll be the outbreak monkey .
i &apos;m going to kill you .
i love you .
stop scratching , &apos; cause you &apos;re just gonna make it worse ,
and then you &apos;re gonna scar .
i gotta get my hands on a body again , mer .
i think i &apos;m gonna get an offer from oregon ,
but i can &apos;t take it . it &apos;s too far .
i can &apos;t do that to alex .
i gotta get this tacoma thing .
oh , you know what would help ?
a call from derek shepherd , head of neurosurgery .
talk to him .
talk to me about what ?
she &apos;s up for a job in tacoma ,
and she wants you to call .
tacoma ?
it isn &apos;t even ranked in top 20 .
yeah , but it &apos;s close ,
and she can repair things with alex .
fine . have her give me the number .
i read the board .
the chief is doing a whipple ,
and you &apos;re scrubbing in .
well , you can stop worrying . he &apos;s fine .
he hasn &apos;t operated in months ,
and his first surgery back is a 7 @-@ hour procedure
with a 20 % complication rate .
first you were worried that he wasn &apos;t operating .
now you &apos;re pissed that he is .
i don &apos;t trust him anymore .
meredith--
post @-@ it .
he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s fine .
i thought it was infection , right ? like pneumonia ?
oh , that &apos;s one of the possibilities .
what are the others ?
well , the fluid could also indicate--
yang .
karev made the diagnosis . let him talk .
heart failure and cancer could also cause
this much fluid to occur .
cancer ?
would you have to remove my lung ?
aaron , he just said cancer is only a possibility .
i sing . it &apos;s my entire life
um ... besides me .
what you meant to say was that
singing was your entire life besides me .
you heard the chief is operating today ?
took my whipple
and is having meredith grey do the pancreatic dissection--
a procedure that i performed for the first time
just last year .
the chief &apos;s judgment ...
is not clear and rational .
miranda , there &apos;s nothing i can do .
you &apos;re the only one who can .
i performed intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemo this morning ,
and i kept looking up into the gallery
to see if the chief was there .
i mean , that was a big deal for me .
anyway , he wasn &apos;t there .
and i don &apos;t know why i thought he would show ,
because the truth is ...
he &apos;s gone .
and he &apos;s been gone a long time .
arizona thought some work might take your mind off your itching .
scratching will take my mind off of itching .
take off my gauze paws .
she said that you &apos;d say that , and that i should say no .
so how about we start with
the tibial plateau fracture , room 22 @-@ 40 ?
i &apos;m an attending . you &apos;re a resident .
as your superior , i &apos;m ordering you to take them off .
she said that you would say that , too .
and technically , i &apos;m on her service today ,
so she &apos;s my boss , not you .
we have the lis fracture , room 22 @-@ 11 .
please let me scratch ,
just for five minutes , just for--
no . it &apos;ll scar .
i don &apos;t care . i don &apos;t care . scars are hot .
scars are badass . scars are poetic .
i &apos;m begging you , little grey .
no , and please don &apos;t call me little grey .
i &apos;m in pain-
&quot; down to the core of my being &quot; pain ,
&quot; i &apos;m going crazy &quot; pain ,
&quot; scary , will this ever go away &quot; pain .
do--do you get that ? do--do--do you know what i--
do you know what i mean
when i--when i say that ?
because this pain is &quot; need to scratch an itch
that i ca-- i can &apos;t scratch , &quot;
&quot; the pain of a thousand itches , &quot; and it &apos;s making me crazy .
not &quot; funny &quot; crazy . this is &quot; bad &quot; crazy , okay ?
it &apos;s &quot; dark &quot; crazy .
it &apos;s &quot; make a suit out of someone else &apos;s skin &quot; crazy , okay ?
pain , little grey . pain .
i had sex with alex .
i had sex with alex , which i regret ,
okay , completely , because i am in love with mark .
i didn &apos;t think .
but i &apos;m scared that i can &apos;t handle the daughter
and the baby and
the &quot; mark &apos;s gonna be a grandpa &quot; thing .
why are you telling me this ?
i am in pain , too , is what i am saying
i get your pain . don &apos;t you see that ?
i do feel your pain because i am in pain , too .
i have pox between my butt cheeks .
your &quot; pain &quot; does not begin to compare to mine .
okay , out .
just out ! out ! out ! out ! out ! out !
what are you talking about ?
she &apos;s on this thing--
okay , if you had to choose between the thing you love , surgery--
and the person you love , which would you choose ?
you choose izzie ? right ?
because you two are gonna get back together .
shut up .
wait , why do you have to choose ?
that doesn &apos;t matter . you just do .
which is it-- surgery or love ?
i want both .
that &apos;s what i said .
no , you--you can &apos;t have both .
why the hell not ?
why the hell is he here ?
i said he could be in here
because he &apos;s in the whipple , too .
okay , whatever . once again , you cannot have both .
you have to choose
choose what ?
uh , my ...
my pet @-@ scan got pushed back an hour ,
so thought i &apos;d ... join you for lunch .
okay . that .
you have to give up that-- learning the procedure ,
tuning out the world until you get it , like , you know ,
doing the procedure is the only thing that matters ,
like if you don &apos;t get to do it , you &apos;ll die .
that &apos;s what you have to give up .
for what ?
love .
why ?
yeah , that &apos;s what i said .
okay , that &apos;s not the point .
you know you couldn &apos;t do it . you know you &apos;d choose the procedure .
fine ! if i had to choose a gun to my head
i would choose surgery . okay ?
okay , well , thank you .
is that so hard to say ?
i don &apos;t know , why is it so bad to say that out loud ?
because it &apos;s crazy .
how--how--
it &apos;s crazy .
surgery--it &apos;s just a job .
it &apos;s just a job . it &apos;s the thing you come home from ,
not the thing you come home to .
and if you lose your job , you get another one ,
&apos;cause there &apos;s always another one .
but ... if you lose your love ...
if you think you &apos;re losing your love ...
well , then suddenly , nothing else matters .
this is what you guys talk about during lunch ?
i &apos;m with them . love comes and goes .
surgery doesn &apos;t .
results are back .
you choose love .
yes ! just did a perfect dissection
without lacerating the portal vein .
you gonna do that little fist pump surgery , too .
the tests showed a malignancy on your left lung .
it &apos;s called pleural mesothelioma .
and it &apos;s a cancer that surrounds the lining of your lung .
so what , you--you-- you cut out his lung ?
well , best case scenario
we won &apos;t have to remove any lung
tissue except tumor .
aaron , did you hear that ? that &apos;s good .
jeffery , i &apos;m not deaf .
what &apos;s the worst @-@ case scenario ?
we get in there , and the damage is too extensive ,
and we have to remove more .
my whole lung ?
that &apos;s the worst @-@ case scenario .
but , yes , it is a possibility .
but it &apos;s also possible they won &apos;t have to remove any . okay ?
so let &apos;s stay positive .
will you please shut up ?
i can &apos;t take your cheerful little voice
shoving positive thinking down my throat
when my life is basically over .
people do recover from things like this .
and then they go on to--
what ? go on to what ?
live .
i won &apos;t have a lung .
i &apos;m a singer . so you see my problem ?
you can direct . you can teach .
like you ?
i &apos;d rather die than spend two hours every day
listening to mediocre music majors doing their scales .
i know that this is a lot to take in ,
and if you need time to talk or get a second opinion--
i want my lung .
dr. altman ...
i &apos;m big ...
too big .
i don &apos;t fit in airplane seats ,
and as jeff is always telling me ,
my feelings don &apos;t always fit the situation .
if my food is overcooked in a restaurant , i get enraged .
i want to kill the waiter .
but i don &apos;t .
i politely ask him to take my meal back
and bring it to me the way i asked for it .
i spend my days making myself smaller ,
more acceptable .
and that &apos;s okay ,
because at night when i go on stage ,
i get to experience the world the way i feel it--
with indescribable rage
and unbearable sadness
and huge passion .
at night , on stage , i get to kill the waiter
and dance on his grave .
and if i can &apos;t do that ...
if i all i have left
is a life of making myself smaller ...
then i don &apos;t want to live .
i don &apos;t .
and believe me , honey ,
you don &apos;t want me to live .
are you stealing sterile supplies ?
i need sterile instruments .
i &apos;m not gonna get caught with my pants down
because this hospital can &apos;t get--
i get it .
i want to do something ...
something i ...
i have a responsibility .
but i just ...
so what &apos;s stopping you ?
meredith .
the other half of the twisted sisters .
is that what you call meredith and cristina--
the twisted sisters ?
well , that fits .
so this ...
this thing ...
i could come out of it looking , uh ...
pretty bad--
like i did it for the wrong reasons ,
like i did it ... for myself .
you know , in my experience , nobody goes into a battle
because they want to win a purple heart .
you do the right thing ,
and sometimes that gets you a medal ,
and sometimes it gets you killed .
how do you know it &apos;s the right thing ?
when it &apos;s the best thing for the most people ,
the thing that ... keeps the most people alive .
how you doing ?
a little claustrophobic .
well , focus on your breathing . that always helps .
alex , i have to know .
when mer called , she said you were moving on .
have you ... moved on ?
i slept with someone .
damn it , alex .
we &apos;ll get through it .
are you still there ?
i &apos;m right here .
can you hold my hand or something
so i know you haven &apos;t left ?
i can &apos;t reach your hand .
oh , yeah .
i can hold your foot .
foot is good .
look , derek , i &apos;m busy .
i have a surgery in less than an hour .
you want me to drink that ?
no . but i believe you will .
i &apos;m gonna go , and you &apos;re gonna drink it .
you &apos;re gonna try not to , but in the end ...
you &apos;ll drink it .
i also believe that this won &apos;t be the first drink you drank today .
this tumor is huge .
i &apos;ve never seen pleura this thick .
it &apos;s like a watermelon rind .
damn it . i &apos;m gonna have to get rid of the lung ,
the diaphragm and the pericardium with this tumor .
yeah , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s what i need to do .
that &apos;s what &apos;s advisable for optimal survival .
but that &apos;s not what we &apos;re gonna do .
we are going to remove the visible tumor
and we are going to treat the lung
with--with intrapleural hyperthermic chemotherapy .
all right , karev ,
find out what bailey used in the procedure this morning ,
and gather everything that i need .
yang , you &apos;re gonna help me remove this tumor .
uh , this morning belly said that the hot chemo lavage
was only indicated in abdomen .
well , sugarman at the brigham has been researching
its applications as it applies the pleural mesothelioma .
and he &apos;s a singer ...
and he needs his lung .
you look like hell .
chickenpox .
stay back . i &apos;m contagious .
i had &apos; em when i was 6 .
well , addison nicked one of the uterine arteries .
oh . but she was able to fix it .
sloan &apos;s okay ,
and the baby &apos;s gonna be okay , too .
oh , good .
i slept with addison .
i gotta tell lexie , right ?
no .
it &apos;s lexie . she &apos;s so good .
how do you lie to a girl like that ?
lie .
really ?
really .
really ?
yeah .
oh , i hurt .
i got you covered , kid .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m gonna help you. mm .
oh. ooh , that &apos;s amazing .
no scar .
no , keep going .
thank you . thank you , thank you , thank you ,
you saved the lung , the whole lung ?
yes .
oh , okay. um ... well , now what ?
well , now the work really begins .
this is gonna be a long recovery , but he should be fine .
does it make me awful to say
that i &apos;m just slightly disappointed ?
i guess i was sitting out here thinking ,
now he &apos;s gonna be like the rest of us ,
who teach and direct
and do all the things he finds so demeaning .
you know what &apos;s demeaning ?
loving a man , taking care of him ,
doing his shopping , making his meals ,
making sure his humidifiers are clean ,
&apos;cause god forbid his humidifiers aren &apos;t clean .
what &apos;s demeaning ... is loving a man
who thinks so little of you .
he &apos;s got an army of nurses ,
so if you want to walk out of here , you can .
we &apos;ll take care of him . you could go .
i love him .
you should hear him sing .
nobody sings that well .
he does .
yeah , see that stitch there ?
you just made the dude diabetic for life .
okay , shut up . i &apos;m trying to concentrate
until the chief gets here .
dr. webber apologizes .
he got caught up in some sort of administrative , something .
so let &apos;s dig in . patient ready ?
yeah , we are all prepped and ready . just waiting on you .
dr. grey , here to open .
oh , actually , i was gonna open , dr. bailey .
okay , sure .
uh , dr. webber was going to let me do
the pancreatic neck dissection , so i &apos;ve prepped .
i don &apos;t believe you &apos;re ready for that .
i &apos;ll be doing it . you &apos;re welcome to observe .
go ahead .
10 @-@ blade .
i &apos;m sorry you didn &apos;t get a chance to do the procedure .
something came up . it happens .
i &apos;m not surprised about richard , though .
you &apos;re not a dumb person ,
but right now , you &apos;re acting like one .
i am not going to turn him in .
tacoma passed on izzie .
i did my best .
just too much history , too many red flags .
if i went to the board , they &apos;d make me chief .
the first thing i &apos;d do is hire stevens back .
it &apos;s your choice . it &apos;s up to you .
that should be me .
don &apos;t be jealous .
they &apos;re just friends-- best friends .
i had the chickenpox ,
and i told her i hadn &apos;t because ...
i ... i find her miraculous ...
breath takingly stunning .
just ... i can &apos;t stop looking at her .
and i was afraid , with the ooze and the fevers
and the scratching--
i @-@ i just--i wanted to stay in the sexy part of things .
so i lied to my girlfriend , and now ...
he makes scratching look sexy .
he makes everything look sexy .
so you get it .
you didn &apos;t have to do that , but you did .
you get it .
what are you talking about ?
i choose surgery over a guy .
i &apos;m not gonna apologize for it , especially to you .
you didn &apos;t have to save his lung .
the right thing would &apos;ve been to remove it .
but the patient was clear
that he didn &apos;t want to live without his gift ,
and you get that .
i choose my gift .
i want to be great , and i want to learn from you .
i choose my gift .
hey , how &apos;d your surgery go ?
great .
see ? and you were all worried .
you &apos;re a rock star . speaking of which ,
do you know if derek has talked to tacoma yet ?
no , i don &apos;t .
okay , good .
&apos;cause i just got my scans back , and they &apos;re really good .
and so it would be great if he could mention
that i am officially not dying of cancer when he talks to them .
i &apos;m gonna get this job , mer .
i &apos;m gonna get this job and i &apos;m gonna get alex back .
and i &apos;m gonna be myself again . i can feel it .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go get derek and show him my scans
before he calls tacoma .
uh , you know , i @-@ i-- i &apos;ll go tell him--derek .
and you go tell alex
ok
okay , fine . you can go to the board .
just ...
sorry . car crash came in .
i got here as soon as i could .
oh , that &apos;s okay . it gave me time to get drunk .
oh , so what &apos;s the occasion ?
you know , i thought beth was an idiot .
i mean , if we &apos;re being honest here ...
i didn &apos;t know that we are
i mean , maybe not an idiot ,
but just not good enough for you .
oh , so how long have you been here .
you know , i &apos;m sure that it wasn &apos;t easy for her ...
teddy--
but do you know what she said to me once ?
she said that once you guys were married ,
she was done .
i mean , she was done teaching
and she was just gonna start making babies .
and i remember thinking to myself ,
wow , i mean , does owen know you have , like , zero ambition ?
and then there &apos;s cristina .
there &apos;s cristina , who is exactly the opposite .
i mean , it would actually be funny
if it wasn &apos;t so just ...
not funny .
i mean ... i get it .
she ... she is beautiful
and talented and kind of amazing .
she &apos;s right . i get her .
okay , i &apos;m calling you a cab . okay ?
i get her .
come on . let &apos;s get you home .
but she was willing to trade you ... for me .
if i stayed , she said i could have you .
how was your surgery ?
uh , it was good .
it was , uh , it was fine . it was ...
here . want to see ?
i &apos;m so ...
i &apos;m so glad .
oh . i &apos;m so glad .
it &apos;s like it never happened .
yeah , but it did .
it all happened , iz .
you got cancer , and we got married ,
and ... you died and you lived again ...
and you ... you left , then you came back .
and we got through it .
i got through it .
and i &apos;m on the other side .
iz , i love you so much ,
and i ...
till i met you ,
i @-@ i used to think i just wasn &apos;t a good guy .
growing up with my family ,
i mean , that &apos;s what they told me .
but now ...
after all of it , i know that i &apos;m a good man .
and i thank you for that ,
because i know now .
that i &apos;m good enough not to deserve this ...
not to have to feel like this ...
not to love you so much that i almost hate you .
i deserve someone who will stay .
i &apos;m happy you &apos;re okay .
and i &apos;m happy about your job .
and i want you to go ...
and be happy and not come back .
meredith ?
i &apos;m sorry about the surgery .
i got caught up with paperwork and just--
you don &apos;t have to apologize .
you don &apos;t have to apologize for anything .
in surgery ...
the healing process begins with a cut ...
an incision ...
the tearing of flesh .
where have you been ?
you just disappeared .
i left you , like , ten messages .
are you drunk ? oh--
wait . what ? what ? what ?
you make me sad .
you think that surgery is gonna make you feel .
you think that a successful career is gonna make you happy .
you think you know things . you know things ,
and nothing else matters , no one else matters .
people do matter . i matter .
we ...
we matter .
so you don &apos;t get to toss me aside .
i won &apos;t let you .
we have to damage the healthy flesh ...
in order to expose the unhealthy .
it feels cruel ...
hey .
hey .
uh ... how did , uh , sloan &apos;s surgery go ?
i slept with addison .
oh , thank god .
&apos;cause i slept with alex .
oh , i was feeling so--
well , you know how i was feeling ...
which is why this--this-- this is great .
you know , we &apos;re---we &apos;re-- we &apos;re even .
we--we kind of canceled each other out .
you slept with karev ?
yeah .
while i was dealing with my sick daughter ?
while i was hurting ?
uh , well , you weren &apos;t hurting .
you were sleeping with addison .
you broke up with me , left me ...
and just ...
i ...
i can &apos;t even look at you right now .
and against common sense .
do you know what it took for me to make this happen ?
please tell derek i &apos;m really sorry .
this isn &apos;t about derek . it &apos;s about me .
it &apos;s about us .
you don &apos;t just walk away from people .
you don &apos;t just throw people away .
i can &apos;t , meredith . okay ?
i can &apos;t be here . please .
please try to understand .
i have to start over . i need to start over , okay ?
please don &apos;t go .
this is your home .
no , it &apos;s not , not anymore .
it &apos;s just a place i worked , and i can do that anywhere .
but it works .
you risk exposure ...
what are you doing ? you &apos;ll ... you &apos;ll get the chickenpox .
so ... i get the chickenpox .
for the sake of healing .
and when it &apos;s over ...
once the incision has been closed ...
you wait .
did you see him before he left ?
no .
i didn &apos;t think it &apos;d make it easier .
for him or for you ?
it &apos;s the best thing for him .
you knew that .
it was the only thing .
well , let &apos;s not pretend you did this for him .
it &apos;s just you and me here , derek .
you did this for you .
in the choice between surgery and love ,
you chose surgery .
you chose ambition today .
so did you .
you knew he wasn &apos;t ready to go back into the o.r.
but you wanted to do that surgery so badly ,
you were willing to overlook it .
we &apos;re the same .
you wait ...
and you hope that your patient will heal ...
that you haven &apos;t in fact ...
just made everything worse .
