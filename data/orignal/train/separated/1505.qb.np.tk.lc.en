okay . we &apos;re almost ready here .
okay . now , easy on the filters , cam .
it &apos;s a family picture . we don &apos;t need sepia tone .
you know what other tone we don &apos;t need ?
play nice .
okay .
we are taking a new photo for above our mantel .
lily &apos;s not in the one up there now ,
and we ... started to get the slight impression that ...
it was bothering her .
lily , we &apos;re ready for dinner , sw--
big smiles !
great .
great .
let &apos;s take a look .
okay . not bad .
not bad .
let &apos;s shake out our faces .
really ?
who took the online course ? shake &apos; em out .
yep . that &apos;s perfect .
1 ... 2 ...
chee @-@ e @-@ e @-@ se !
chee @-@ e @-@ e @-@ se !
okay . great !
okay , um , mitchell ,
can i see you over here , please ?
yeah .
hang tight , sweetie .
look .
why is she doing that with her face ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve never seen
such a weird , forced smile .
how do i look ?
beautiful .
perfect .
what an amazing campus !
i mean , look at these cool buildings .
and did you guys see the turtles ?
and check this out --
a reflecting pond .
great . maybe you can see how crazy you &apos;re being right now .
god , i wish i &apos;d brought a frisbee .
what &apos;s so special ?
it looks exactly like the college i went to .
and we &apos;ve been here
exactly as long as you were there .
luke , be nice .
well , alex is leaving .
somebody &apos;s got to keep the trains running .
back me up here , guys .
this place screams &quot; alex , &quot; right ?
it looks like every other college in america .
what am i missing ?
good grades , s.a.t. scores , basic verbal skills .
that &apos;s how you do it .
caltech is the perfect school .
for claire .
and alex ! come on , we are talking about
one of the best schools in the country .
and , yes , it happens to be 45 minutes from our house .
of course , we &apos;ll support her wherever she goes .
obviously . nothing is more important to me
than her academic whatever ,
but with alex ,
the important thing is keeping her close
for the next four years .
after that , i &apos;m never gonna see her
unless she skypes me from neptune ,
where she &apos;s living in a biodome she invented .
awesome ! that means christmas on neptune !
every other year ?
no . no .
all right , everyone , gather &apos; round .
we &apos;ll be starting the tour in just a moment .
okay . i &apos;m gonna peel off and hit the robotics lab
to see how close they are to a working female .
hold on .
they &apos;re not nearly as close as you &apos;d hope ,
and you &apos;re not leaving my side .
but it &apos;s so boring .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m being punished .
you are being punished .
that &apos;s what happens when your teacher calls
to tell me you cut class .
i &apos;m sorry . i lost track of time making my movie .
hummingbirdman --
a superhero whose heart can beat a thousand times a minute .
but can it love ?
check it -- there &apos;s a lab on campus
where they do experiments on you for 50 bucks .
oh , yeah . yeah , i used to do a lot of these in college .
sometimes it &apos;s questions .
sometimes they hook stuff up to you .
sometimes it &apos;s just palling around with a monkey ,
wondering why they &apos;re rewarding him and not you .
well , that sounds great . you should go do that .
i &apos;ll go .
i &apos;m up for it as long as they don &apos;t shave anything .
hey , i &apos;d love the 50 bucks ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure mom wants me here .
no , i don &apos;t . you can go .
oh , you can drop the act .
i know you guys forced me to come here
so i can watch alex
and get all inspired by college again .
we really didn &apos;t .
yeah , you just got in the car .
i only packed four sandwiches .
happy anniversary , jay !
i don &apos;t love this tableau .
is that gloria &apos;s gift to me ?
what is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
sure you do . i can tell by the wrap job .
she can &apos;t make corners like this , manny !
only because she &apos;s always in such a hurry .
is life so busy you can &apos;t take 20 minutes
to get out the straight @-@ edge and wrap a gift anymore ?
come on . i &apos;m a little anxious about my gift for her .
it would make me feel a lot better
if i knew she phoned this one in .
sorry , jay . only time will tell .
oh , god .
it &apos;s that black panerai watch i wanted , isn &apos;t it ? !
why can &apos;t you be this fast when i &apos;m your charades partner ?
hola , my loves !
you didn &apos;t see me . keep her out of the garage .
what are we gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna talk to her .
i &apos;ve been photographing her for years .
we have a relationship .
really ? what &apos;s she like ?
i mean a professional relationship .
look , i &apos;m gonna tell her --
her smile is forced , it &apos;s unnatural ,
and we &apos;re not going home until we get what we need .
couple of things --
we are home , and that &apos;s mean .
what &apos;s your suggestion ?
we show her the photos
and let her discover her weird smile on her own .
okay . that &apos;s good .
i video our football games
so i can see what we &apos;re doing wrong .
that &apos;s how i figured out
that powder @-@ blue windbreaker washed me out so much .
oh , thank god . i &apos;m sure the team appreciated that .
lily , sweetheart , will you come here for a second ?
yep .
let &apos;s do this gently , okay ?
hi , sweetheart .
okay . so , daddy and i thought
that we would look at these photos together ,
the pictures that we &apos;ve taken so far ,
and see if there &apos;s anything that we would do differently .
like , okay , when i look at this photo ,
i think , &quot; i could stand up straighter . &quot;
yeah .
cam ?
okay . i think i could be
a little less &quot; ryan gosling &quot;
and a little more &quot; every man . &quot;
lily , is there anything that you see in yourself
that you would want to change here ?
well , maybe we should just do one more ?
really ? okay .
this might need a little powder .
uh , jay ?
your wife &apos;s upstairs .
you don &apos;t have to hide in the garage anymore .
i &apos;m not hiding .
close the door , will you ?
how bad is the gift you bought her ?
i didn &apos;t buy her anything .
bad idea .
i once gave her a bag full of hugs ,
and she definitely prefers stuff .
it &apos;s not hugs .
does that sound like me ?
i made her something in my pottery class .
i can &apos;t believe you took a pottery class .
you &apos;re not the only one around here with an artsy side .
yeah , i could &apos;ve bought her another piece of jewelry ,
but i thought , you know , she might like this a little more ,
coming from the heart and all .
well , show it to me . what is it ?
what is it ?
it &apos;s a bunny .
it used to be my nickname for her .
on our first date , she had a cold ,
and she was sniffling a lot ,
and her nose would wrinkle up real cute --
you know , like a bunny .
that &apos;s so sweet .
yeah , but that watch is big and gorgeous
and costs big bucks .
i can &apos;t give her something handmade . i mean , she --
she &apos;s not sensitive like you and me .
listen to me .
i think you went to the jewelry store inside here ,
and you brought back a gem .
knock it off .
you think so ?
she &apos;s gonna love it . it &apos;s perfect .
perfect ? nah .
but teacher pablo did say it shows great promise .
and i am proud of the tail .
look at that .
no , no , i said look .
sorry .
and this building is home to one of our five nobel laureates
currently teaching here .
it also houses our high @-@ current ,
high @-@ stability particle accelerator .
okay . you need to calm down .
this is a college tour ,
not oprah &apos;s favorite things .
i am just so impressed by this place . aren &apos;t you ?
of course i am .
it &apos;s one of the most prestigious tech schools in the country .
but if you must know ,
i don &apos;t love everything about it .
what ? oh , the mascot &apos;s a beaver .
don &apos;t worry . those jokes will get old .
no , they won &apos;t , because i &apos;m not coming here .
honestly , the only reason i took this tour today
is so you won &apos;t accuse me of
not giving it a fair shot .
why wouldn &apos;t you want to go here ?
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re making me say this ...
it &apos;s too close to home .
i have to get away from you guys for a little bit , okay ?
all right . we &apos;re gonna check out the dorms .
parents , say goodbye to your children .
okay .
i should go .
mom , wait !
honey , it &apos;s okay .
we all say things that we don &apos;t mean sometimes .
low blood sugar . i need my sandwich .
yeah .
yeah .
all right . you can please wait here ,
and the experiment will begin shortly .
okay . thank you .
yeah .
what do you guys think this is gonna be ?
i bet they &apos;ll show us those ink blots
that always look like two girls kissing .
a little tip from an old pro --
they can electrify cheese , so ...
hey , look at that .
&quot; do not push . &quot;
what are you doing ?
teaching this button a little something about free will .
luke , it says , &quot; do not push . &quot;
which just makes me want to push it more .
haley , back me up .
push it , don &apos;t push it . i don &apos;t care .
is this mirror weird ? i look fuzzy .
who puts up a button
with a sign that says you can &apos;t push it ?
the same people who stack the deck
so the monkey always wins ...
scientists !
what are you talking about ?
we &apos;re not waiting for the experiment .
this is the experiment !
they &apos;re watching us right now !
wait . what ?
and ...
okay . good .
all right . let &apos;s take a look .
oh ! beautiful .
okay . she looks like pepper &apos;s pomeranian .
we have to say something .
what &apos;s going on ? why are we still doing this ?
honey , daddy and i think you are a beautiful girl
with a beautiful smile .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
and i &apos;m seeing that here , okay ?
but i &apos;m just not seeing it here .
what do you mean ?
uh , well , uh ...
lily , you &apos;re doing a different smile today .
different how ?
it &apos;s just a little ... stiff .
is it ugly ?
it &apos;s not ugly . no .
it &apos;s , uh -- it , um ...
cam ...
uh , well , s @-@ sweetie , um ,
it &apos;s just not your normal smile , which is so beautiful .
you mean i &apos;m not beautiful ?
no , that &apos;s not what we &apos;re saying .
just forget it ! i don &apos;t want to do this anymore !
i &apos;m an ugly monster ,
and i &apos;m never coming out of my room again !
okay . well , that was a disaster .
agreed . but can i just say
i love how melodramatic she &apos;s getting ?
so fantastic .
the little ...
i know .
there she is .
hi , mi amor . happy anniversary !
happy anniversary , honey .
i hope you like this .
what did you get me ?
what did you get me ?
it &apos;s a bunny , mom .
it &apos;s a little rough around the edges ,
but i &apos;m just hoping you &apos;ll love what i put into it .
oh , you put something inside ? !
i don &apos;t get it . there &apos;s nothing inside .
yeah , that &apos;s , uh ... &apos; cause , um ...
the damn stupid jeweler didn &apos;t put the bracelet in there .
the rose gold with the waves that i told you that i loved ?
yeah . yeah , that &apos;s the one .
jay .
no , it &apos;s fine , manny .
i can run down to the store right now and get it .
stupid jeweler !
ay , jay , don &apos;t scream at him .
it was an honest mistake .
yeah , in his heart ,
he was probably trying to do the right thing .
and past the millikan library ,
you &apos;ll find the bridge annex ,
which is also the same site
that carl d. anderson discovered the ... ?
neutron .
anyone else ?
positron .
positron .
that &apos;s right .
in 1932 ...
on august 2nd ...
on the third floor .
really ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know . maybe i just wanted to win .
i &apos;m jason .
alex .
is this your first @-@ choice school ?
no , i &apos;m thinking m.i.t ..
that &apos;s weird .
i live just half an hour from there .
which explains why you want to go here .
i live here , and i want to go somewhere on the east coast .
really ? i &apos;d love to be close to home .
sunday dinners , laundry ,
make sure my brother doesn &apos;t mess with
my hand @-@ painted civil war miniatures ...
which i don &apos;t cherish .
so why not m.i.t. ?
well , for applied physics , this is the better program ,
and i &apos;m not gonna make the biggest decision of my life
based off where my parents live .
okay , then .
sorry . did that ... sound judgey ?
i &apos;m not really good at talking to pretty girls .
i -- well , i have a touch of asperger &apos;s .
no , i don &apos;t .
i just said that so you &apos;d think i was interesting .
i was ... just sorta hoping you &apos;d be going here .
really ?
did my mother put you up to this ?
does your mom tell boys to flirt with you ?
oh . you &apos;re -- you &apos;re -- you &apos;re flirting with me .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean to sound so surprised .
a lot of boys flirt with me .
not a lot . some .
actually , one of them has asperger &apos;s .
he could tell you the weather on the day you were born .
okay . well , i don &apos;t know why i said that .
the point is , i am single , by my own choosing , so ...
oh , my god !
i am fine ! i &apos;m fine ! everything &apos;s fine !
i have to push it .
it &apos;s all i can think of .
just let him push it . who cares ?
no one is touching this button !
don &apos;t you see ?
this is a test of character --
to see if we &apos;re the kind of people with self @-@ control
or the kind who just grab at any piece of cheese
that &apos;s put in front of them .
don &apos;t you want to know what it does ?
&quot; want to know what it does &quot; ?
of course i do . it &apos;s killing me .
but what i want more
is for you to learn to follow the rules .
is this about me skipping class again ?
it &apos;s weird how obsessed you are with that .
now let me push that button !
no !
if you can &apos;t even pass a simple test ,
how are you ever gonna get in to a good college ?
or hold down a job ? we only have one basement .
there &apos;s no place for you to move
when your life bottoms out !
okay .
dad , i cut that class
because i had to get one last shot for my movie .
you would &apos;ve done the same thing .
oh , my god !
you &apos;re not mad at me .
you &apos;re mad at yourself because i &apos;m just like you .
total shot in the dark .
you &apos;re right -- i set a terrible example for you .
no ! it was awesome !
do you think steve jobs followed every rule ?
doug henning ?
keep talking .
what about that guy who lived in that town
where people weren &apos;t allowed to dance ?
did footloose follow the rules ?
his name was ren , and he most certainly did not .
maybe that &apos;s what those scientists are looking for --
rebels !
you know what ?
who gives a hoot what those bastards want ?
no offense .
we &apos;re gonna break every rule , and we &apos;re pushing that button !
yeah !
back away from the button !
what are you doing ?
i &apos;ve been breaking the rules my entire life ,
and look where it &apos;s gotten me .
i live in my parents &apos; basement !
i &apos;m sick of being a failure at everything !
oh , my god !
you &apos;re not mad at us .
you &apos;re mad at yourself .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying !
where were you ?
consoling jay .
that bunny wasn &apos;t the only thing you shattered , lady .
when you first started dating him ,
what was his nickname for you ?
sexy pants .
the other one .
bunny .
oh , so that &apos;s why he put the bracelet inside the bunny .
there was no bracelet .
the bunny was the present .
that ?
he made it for you himself .
no .
in a pottery class he &apos;s been taking for weeks .
no !
and you smashed it on the counter .
and he was too embarrassed to say anything .
no !
i can &apos;t take it !
glue ! okay , give me glue !
i need glue !
make it stop !
haley , put down the chair .
why should i ? !
because this is getting absurd ,
and it &apos;s no fun being laughed at
by a room full of scientists and a monkey in a diaper .
yeah ! we need to push that button ,
show those eggheads that we &apos;re not sheep !
no ! breaking the rules doesn &apos;t make you a hero !
it makes you a screw @-@ up !
take it from me , luke --
one out of a million dropouts
becomes steve jobs .
do you know who become losers with no jobs ?
the other 99,000 !
honey , you are not a loser .
oh , please .
i hear the shots you all take at me .
i see my sister about to lap me
at a college that i would never be able to get into .
even someone as dumb as me
can see that i &apos;m a giant failure !
haley , stop , okay ?
haley , let me tell you something --
you have value , talent , and potential
that their tests can &apos;t measure .
who cares if you don &apos;t fit into their little box .
you &apos;re finding your way .
that &apos;s what your 20s are for --
to take chances ...
to -- to make mistakes and to learn from them ,
and you are learning from them .
the fact that you won &apos;t push this button proves that .
that was really sweet , dad .
i can &apos;t believe i was gonna hit you
over the head with that chair .
wait . so now we &apos;re not pushing the button ?
no . we &apos;re supporting haley .
for the rest of your life .
that is not helpful .
we need to stick together .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s what this test is .
it &apos;s not about whether we push the button
or don &apos;t push the button .
you want to find out if this unites us or divides us .
let &apos;s join hands
and send these sons of bitches
and their filthy monkey a message !
feels good .
wait a minute .
how are they gonna know we &apos;re sending them a message
if we &apos;re not doing anything ?
that &apos;s true .
we have to hit that button .
damn straight .
yeah .
who did that ?
we did ...
as a family .
did you not see the sign ?
now the a.c. won &apos;t shut off . we have to call a guy .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . is this ...
what if , uh ...
yeah , building full of scientists
and no one thought to push the button twice .
please use number 2 pencils .
yeah , just wall .
so this is the ... test .
i got that cleared up with the jeweler .
boy , was he embarrassed .
what &apos;s that ?
is that my bunny ?
no . i am your bunny .
jay , i don &apos;t want that bracelet anymore .
this is the most amazing gift you have ever given me .
really ? you--you--you like it ?
i love it .
and putting it back together
made me realize how much work you put into it .
well , it--it &apos;s all in the details , really .
the bunny was in the clay .
i just had to find it .
now i &apos;m going to give you yours .
i think it &apos;s about that time .
and this would be , um ...
a bookmark made of movie tickets
from the first movie we ever saw together .
i @-@ i @-@ i love it .
it &apos;s the kind of thing i &apos;d never get for myself .
ever .
this is what we should always do for each other--
thoughtful , handmade gifts .
we get too caught up in--in material possessions .
ah , we got too much stuff .
return this first thing tomorrow .
yeah , and i &apos;m gonna return the watch that i bought you .
dinner &apos;s ready !
so , is that the rose gold bracelet that i wanted ?
dynamite piece of jewelry .
and that watch--
is that the ceramic with the 10 @-@ day , uh , power reserve ?
of course . it &apos;s so sexy , that watch .
yeah , the matte finish
doesn &apos;t always catch the sun and blind you like this one .
it &apos;s so interesting , &apos; cause i love shiny things on my wrist .
oh , for god sakes , just keep the stupid gifts .
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
i think cam and i made a huge mistake .
oh , i get it . marriage is tough .
just take a deep breath
and go flirt with somebody at the grocery store .
no , about lily .
we &apos;re trying to take this new family picture ,
and she &apos;s doing this weird smile thing ...
and you said something ?
uh , well , let &apos;s--let &apos;s just say cam did .
first of all , all kids go through this .
you should see every picture
we have of luke from third grade .
he looks like he &apos;s mid @-@ sneeze , which is a shame ,
&apos;cause i was having a great boob year .
what did you do ?
i think it might &apos;ve been the birth control i was taking , but ...
no , come on . about luke !
oh ! nothing . we didn &apos;t do anything .
mitchell , i say this with love ,
but when you became a parent ,
i knew this was gonna be a problem for you
&apos;cause you like to control everything .
good lord . what would that sound like without love ?
bottom line-- it &apos;s all gonna work itself out .
but if you push her on it ,
she &apos;s just gonna push you away .
oh , my god .
thanks for coming , everybody .
as you know , our acceptance rate is 8 % ,
so in the fall , i look forward to seeing one out of ...
12.5 .
12.5 .
12.5 .
so ... not him .
well , i guess this is it , m.i.t.
uh , when you visit boston , look me up ...
darling .
okay , sweetie .
uh , t @-@ that &apos;s my last name-- jason darling .
oh , well , alex dunphy--
&quot; p @-@ h &quot; not &quot; f , &quot;
&quot; y &quot; not &quot; e @-@ e . &quot;
&quot; d @-@ u @-@ n @-@ p @-@ h ... &quot;
why am i still talking ?
all right .
bye .
there you are .
listen , honey , i am so sorry about pushing so hard earlier .
if anyone is able to make a smart decision
about where to go to school , it &apos;s you .
even if that school is all the way
on the other side of the country .
actually , there &apos;s a lot to like here .
really ? !
that &apos;s cool .
whatever .
i guess there &apos;s somebody around here
she &apos;s not ready to say goodbye to .
he friended me !
okay , come on , we have something to show you .
is it dinner , or is my mouth too ugly to put food in ?
okay , no .
and please don &apos;t say things like that about yourself .
you picked one ?
we sure did ,
and we &apos;re sorry we made you feel bad .
we just weren &apos;t used to your new smile ,
but now we are , and we love it !
yes , it &apos;s beautiful , and you &apos;re beautiful ,
and we don &apos;t want to change a single thing about you .
except maybe your underpants .
okay , where did that laugh come from ?
