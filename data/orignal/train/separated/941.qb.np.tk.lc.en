i have another child , lynette .
you don &apos;t wanna gave me permission , remember ?
not to sleep with the woman who &apos;s carrying our child !
for some , love will wither ...
do i know you ?
orson hodge . susan &apos;s dentist friend .
... while others will wait for love .
for others , new love will bloom ...
... that may never arrive .
something awful happened on lakeview drive last year .
to understand why , you need to know
that , when alma hodge awoke that morning ,
she had no idea this would be
the day she &apos;d leave her husband .
certainly , it began normally enough .
she put away the groceries per his instructions .
she hung his dry cleaning exactly as he had requested .
she folded the towels just as he had taught her .
it was just before noon ...
mama loves her baby . does the baby love mama ?
mama .
... when something inside alma broke
and she decided it was time to fly away .
of course , she knew better than to say this to her husband .
he thought alma was happy .
and orson hodge did not like to be contradicted .
so she waited till he &apos;d left for work .
and then ...
baby , you gotta come down now . mama &apos;s in a hurry .
hurry . hurry .
if you don &apos;t get back in your cage right now ,
i have to leave you behind . please .
the next day , carolyn bigsby stopped by .
and , like most nosy neighbors ,
she knew you learned more if you didn &apos;t knock .
alma ? are you home ?
carolyn ?
i was just looking for alma .
we had a coffee date this morning . she never showed .
uh , alma left yesterday .
left ?
we had a bit of a row .
harvey and i thought we
heard some raised voices . so where &apos;d she go ?
don &apos;t know . but i wouldn &apos;t worry about it . i &apos;m sure she &apos;s fine .
orson , no .
orson , no .
so if i hear from alma ,
i &apos;ll let her know that you dropped by .
yes , orson hodge was a man who did not like to be contradicted ...
... by anyone .
it doesn &apos;t rain very often in the town of fairview .
but when it does , it pours .
it was on just such a day that bree van de kamp
went on her first date with her new friend , orson hodge ,
a date that ended with a kiss in the rain .
this occurred just as gabrielle solis was conferring
with her new divorce lawyer
and describing , in vivid detail ,
her husband &apos;s affair with their maid ,
who also happened to be their surrogate .
meanwhile , lynette scavo was busy
meeting her husband &apos;s illegitimate daughter ...
... while resisting the urge to strangle the girl &apos;s mother .
this happened just after susan mayer learned mike delfino
had been badly injured in a hit @-@ and @-@ run accident
and was now in a coma at fairview memorial hospital .
at that same moment , edie britt was putting up a for @-@ sale sign
on the lawn of the house where i once lived .
edie had also planned to spruce up
the property by washing down the driveway ,
but she was pleased to see the rain
had already taken care of that .
this is what rainy days are good for .
they make everything clean again ...
... which is necessary on a street like wisteria lane ,
where everything can get so messy .
welcome , welcome .
don &apos;t worry about the water .
the wood floors are laminated . here &apos;s a flyer .
the police found her severed fingers in the garage .
oh , no .
and they never found felicia &apos;s body .
i wouldn &apos;t be surprised if someday you open a cabinet , and hello !
karen , dear . have you seen the marble backsplash ?
i just must show it to you . excuse us .
what are you trying to do to me , you backstabbing cow ?
they asked why the owner was selling .
i told them that paul young was in jail .
they asked why . conversation has a flow .
well , knock it off .
i &apos;ve been trying to unload this house for months .
you are not helping .
those are for potential buyers , you withered old mooch .
good luck trying to find one of those .
maybe it &apos;ll be easier with the applewhite house
and that rec room in the basement .
get out .
get out . get out , get out , get out .
edie ? do you have a moment , please ?
yes . yes , yes , yes .
guys .
settle down .
come on !
is kayla ready yet ?
just a sec .
honey , thank you for this .
it &apos;s a little weird , i mean
to send a family christmas photo with your husband &apos;s love child .
it means a lot to her to feel included .
no problem . she &apos;s a great little girl . ok ?
all right , let &apos;s do this . i am just going to check the focus .
nora .
lynette .
uh @-@ huh . what are you doing there ?
well , it &apos;s a family photo , right ?
tom , could i check your tie again ?
she sat down so quickly , i didn &apos;t know what to say .
how about , &quot; you &apos;re in the frame , bitch . move . &quot;
lynette ...
no , i am sorry .
how much of her crap do i have to put up with ?
first , it &apos;s little drop @-@ bys ,
then she &apos;s inviting herself to dinner three times a week .
now she wants to be in our christmas photo ?
i &apos;m sorry , no . that &apos;s not happening .
hey , guys . don &apos;t fight . it &apos;s the holidays .
nora ... this is just for our family .
i would prefer if you weren &apos;t in it .
ok .
kayla , honey , we gotta go . they &apos;re kicking us out .
we didn &apos;t say that kayla couldn &apos;t be in the photo .
yeah , well , you know what ?
if i &apos;m not your family , then she &apos;s not your family .
it &apos;s ok . i don &apos;t have to be in the picture .
fine . fine . no , absolutely fine .
put crazy at the end and we can crop her out later .
fair enough . everything &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok . come on , guys . come on back .
thank you , lynette .
that &apos;s the christmas spirit that i was looking for .
ten seconds .
i think this is a little stiff . i have a really fun idea .
where are my crackers ?
we &apos;re out , but i got you a pickle .
pickles and soup ? who eats that ?
you know , that &apos;s all i got .
ever heard of a store ?
you did not just do that .
i hate pickles .
pick it up .
doctor say i only get out of bed to pee .
better for baby , remember ?
don &apos;t go . i need you to rub my feet .
they &apos;re sore . and doctor say ...
cut it out , xiao mei .
he didn &apos;t say anything about rubbing your chubby stumps .
rub them yourself .
you treat me like dirt .
would you rather go live with mr. solis
in a dingy one @-@ bedroom apartment
with no air conditioning and no cable ?
no , i didn &apos;t think so .
you are meanest person i know .
i am the meanest person you know .
you &apos;ve been in this country a year .
modify your nouns , damn it .
what a bitch .
i can &apos;t wait for you to pop out that baby , because when you do ,
i am putting you on the first plane back to shanghai .
you &apos;re gonna be on all fours in a rice paddy
before the epidural wears off .
but you promised to get me apartment in chinatown ,
so i can work for my friend in restaurant , start a new life .
tell it to my chinese friend , sue me .
we do have people in the hospital who could do that .
but i like doing it . i think mike would want me to . oops .
so have you got the results of his latest mri yet ?
i &apos;m afraid there was no change .
well , how long until you can do another one ?
i don &apos;t wanna tell you not to be optimistic ...
it &apos;s been six months , but he could still come out of it , right ?
i saw on the news , this woman in peru woke up after ten years .
there &apos;s a reason that made the news .
you might think i &apos;m naive , but i know he &apos;s coming back to me .
susan ...
don &apos;t say it .
you just keep doing your job , and i &apos;ll keep doing mine .
that risotto was perfect .
just like you .
listen , i hope you saved room for dessert .
i got us something special
from a wonderful little bakery downtown .
that is so adorable .
but i don &apos;t think i can eat another bite .
here , let me take half .
what do you say , bree ? will you marry me ?
this is a little sudden , isn &apos;t it ?
we &apos;ve only known each other six months ,
but i &apos;ve loved you every minute of it .
but if you don &apos;t share my feelings ...
no , no , um ...
i do . it &apos;s just that i can &apos;t help being cautious .
since rex , i haven &apos;t been exactly lucky in love .
i used to feel the same way .
when alma left me , i was shattered .
i realize now it was the luckiest day of my life
because it meant i was free when i met you .
luck can change , bree . let me change yours .
yes .
yes ?
yes , i will marry you , orson .
ian hainsworth had been miserable
ever since a tragic horseback riding accident
had left his wife , jane , in a coma .
for the next three years ,
he shied away from all social contact
because he wanted to be alone with his grief .
then one day he met susan mayer ,
who , because of her own tragedy ,
was just as miserable as he was .
and a friendship slowly blossomed ,
because , as everyone knows ,
misery loves company .
and ian was loving this company
more and more every day .
... two ... three ...
itch , itch , itch , itch , itch . itch , itch , itch .
do the nurses know you do this ?
you weren &apos;t supposed to see that .
clearly .
but you can buy my silence if you &apos;ll have coffee with me .
i would love to , but i &apos;m in a rush .
i &apos;m supposed to meet my girlfriends for lunch . is it one yet ?
you tell me .
i noticed you &apos;re always rushing into the hall to check the time ,
so i bought you this .
i can &apos;t accept this .
this is too extravagant .
it &apos;s nothing .
a guy had a bunch of them laid out on a blanket .
if you look closely , it says folex .
still , i ...
please .
it would make me so happy if you took it .
well , in that case , thank you for my cheap knockoff .
oh , my god , i &apos;m late .
i &apos;m so sorry i &apos;m late .
no , that &apos;s fine .
white gloves . are we having luncheon in the 1880s ?
well , it &apos;s a very elegant club .
orson &apos;s been a member here for years .
it &apos;ll be even nicer when they finish the construction .
you were mysterious on the phone .
why did you want to have lunch ?
well , i wanted to invite you
to a dinner orson and i are having this saturday .
so you asked us to a meal to announce another meal ?
that &apos;s so bree of you .
what &apos;s the occasion ?
oh , um , no occasion .
just a little get @-@ together .
what are you being so coy about ?
i &apos;m not being coy .
she said , coyly .
if you don &apos;t tell us , we &apos;re not coming .
all right .
i wanted to wait and make a proper announcement , but ...
orson and i are engaged .
oh , my gosh .
let me see .
you move fast .
i know it &apos;s quick , but it just feels so right .
orson is just the most warm , wonderful , generous man .
generous . that means he &apos;s good in the sack .
actually , no , we haven &apos;t had sex yet .
we &apos;re waiting until we get married .
oh , my god , you &apos;re serious ?
no sex at all ? not even ... ?
whatever you &apos;re alluding to , no .
but you &apos;re gonna get married .
you wouldn &apos;t buy a car without
at least taking it for a little test drive .
it &apos;s not like you &apos;ve never
slept with a guy you weren &apos;t married to .
true , i have , in the past , given myself away too freely .
how charming to bring that up while i &apos;m announcing my engagement .
but i like to think i have learned from my mistakes .
so , the dinner is at 8 : 00 .
and when we make the announcement ,
please , everybody look surprised .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m going to replay the look
when i found out you hadn &apos;t banged him yet .
hey , sexy mama .
that &apos;s cute .
you invited kayla to parker &apos;s birthday party ?
of course .
and ?
and ?
what did you tell nora ?
i told her
that we were picking up kayla for a quiet afternoon at home .
you lied ?
you &apos;re damn straight , i lied .
i will not have that lunatic ruining one more family gathering .
but kayla &apos;s gonna , you know , tell nora that we had a party ,
and i &apos;m just afraid that nora &apos;s gonna blow a gasket .
what ?
so , what are you saying ?
you &apos;re more afraid of nora than you &apos;re of me ?
is that what you think i meant ?
because that is so not what i meant .
you scare the hell out of me , baby .
thank you .
the coffee machine was broken , so i got cups of smoothies .
they had strawberry and strawberry .
i hate strawberry .
so give me the strawberry .
hi , jane .
nothing against smoothies ,
but i wouldn &apos;t mind some real food sometime .
maybe we could go to a restaurant .
you mean outside the hospital ?
yeah , you know , like a date .
a date ?
yeah . there &apos;s a lovely little bistro down the street .
i &apos;m so ... i &apos;m really , really sorry .
well , that sounds just ... that sounds great .
i mean , i hope that &apos;s ok .
yeah .
so , i was thinking about
how that sounded just now , the date thing .
i really sprang it on you out of nowhere .
yes , you did .
jane looked cold .
thanks .
look , we &apos;re both in difficult situations .
i &apos;ve been in mine a lot longer than you have .
if you &apos;re not ready , i understand .
if you ever should be , let me know .
all right .
i am really hungry .
well , then , let &apos;s go to
the blood bank and swipe some sugar cookies .
you might wanna give jane a sponge bath .
she had a little accident .
hello ?
hey , lynette , it &apos;s me .
hey , nora .
are you having a party ?
shh ! quiet , quiet , quiet . no .
no , of course not .
in fact , we &apos;re just having a quiet afternoon at home .
the kids are so bored .
we were thinking of taking them out for ice cream .
well , would you tell kayla that mommy called to check on her ?
i will , i will . and i &apos;ll see you tonight .
ok . bye .
you think she bought it ?
no .
i think she &apos;ll be over here in ten minutes .
ok , let &apos;s move , let &apos;s move .
i &apos;ve got ten bucks here
for the kid who can carry the most stuff , ok ?
hey , gabby , it &apos;s lynette . got a little emergency here .
is it ok if we use your backyard ?
great , great .
and we take complete responsibility for whatever the pony does .
hope you get this message soon .
my only concern would be the neighborhood .
we really need a quiet place for our retirement .
oh , are you kidding ?
there &apos;s no place in fairview that &apos;s more peaceful .
where the hell &apos;s the pony ?
ok , guys . come on , come on , come on !
let me show you the media room .
ok , go on in . and the balloons .
good , good . all right .
ok . that &apos;s it . everybody &apos;s in .
where &apos;s the cake ?
oh , crap .
anybody home ?
hello ?
hey , nora .
wow . we weren &apos;t expecting you until seven .
so where &apos;s kayla ?
i thought i told you tom took the kids to the movies .
uh @-@ uh . you said ice cream .
uh @-@ huh . after the movies .
movies then ice cream . an american tradition .
so , is something wrong ?
to be honest , i thought that you were lying and having a party .
i guess i was wrong .
oh , apology accepted .
want me to walk you to your car ?
where did everybody go ?
nora , look , i am sorry i lied ,
but , you know , you gave me no choice .
lynette , i want my daughter .
where &apos;s the damn party ?
no . i &apos;m not telling .
where &apos;s the party ?
no , no , no . you want in , you &apos;re gonna have to go through me .
i want my kid , lynette .
kayla ! kayla , come out here now !
what is going on ?
well , first you have a party and you don &apos;t invite me .
and then you lie about it . so now we &apos;re leaving .
well , wait a minute . hold on , hold on , hold on , kayla .
i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;re sorry . we shouldn &apos;t have done it .
but , look , kayla is having such a good time .
why don &apos;t we all just have some cake and we can just ... ? lynette .
we can just have fun . could you excuse me for one second ?
lynette .
ok , ok , i know , but what else could i do ?
i &apos;m just thinking of kayla .
i know you are , tom , and i know you love her .
why else do you think i &apos;m willing to put up with all this for six months ?
why do you think i &apos;ll say to my college roommates ,
&quot; yes . that &apos;s my husband &apos;s love child
and her mother in our christmas picture . &quot;
because i am your wife .
you always come first with me .
do i still come first with you ?
i guess i &apos;ll see you later , nora .
well , i &apos;m taking kayla .
well , that &apos;s a shame . i &apos;ve gotta go hoist a pinata .
mommy , they have a pinata .
fine . i &apos;ll be back at seven .
but there had better be a corner piece of cake waiting for me .
come on , kayla . go have some fun . go have some fun .
thank you for that .
sure .
i &apos;ll be back in 20 minutes .
gonna go buy a pinata ?
sure am .
xiao mei ?
come on out . i have your lunch .
xiao mei , your favorite soap is on .
there &apos;s a doctor fondling a patient on the operating table .
you &apos;re missing it .
xiao mei ?
xiao mei ?
hey , quick question . have you by any chance seen xiao mei ?
i can &apos;t believe you lost our baby .
i did not lose our baby .
stop saying that . i know exactly where it is .
inside some crazy chinese woman
who stole half a chicken from my fridge .
hi . hi . li wang , right ?
remember me ? xiao mei lives with me .
you came over . we had lunch .
you &apos;ve got some nerve showing your face here . get out .
what happened to that famous chinese hospitality ?
xiao mei called me . she said you threatened to send her back to china
to work as a slave in a rice paddy .
i may have mentioned deportation ,
but i didn &apos;t think she &apos;d take it personally .
are you crazy ?
it was banter .
has this country come to the point
where you can &apos;t joke with the help ?
you treat xiao mei like dirt .
she &apos;s just a poor innocent girl trying to live the american dream ,
just like your ancestors .
don &apos;t give me that we are the world crap .
that woman &apos;s uterus is harboring a stolen baby .
if you know where she is , you better start talking ,
or i &apos;ll get the health department down here
to take a closer look at what you &apos;re serving as moo shu pork .
boy , those people just don &apos;t have a sense of humor , do they ?
i &apos;m telling you , at this number , it &apos;s not gonna last long .
we like the neighborhood ,
but we heard some odd things have gone on with this house .
complete fabrication .
malicious lies spread by jealous competitors .
now you &apos;ve gotta check out this storage .
you &apos;re not gonna believe what you can fit in here .
and now the media room .
wow , we certainly devoured that ice cream .
can i get you anything else ?
you tell me .
orson .
i thought we ...
orson .
i just assumed , now we &apos;re engaged ...
does that change our core values ?
no .
but when i saw you standing
in front of the freezer in a clingy silk dress ,
let &apos;s just say , well , it challenged them .
well , i thought we agreed
we wanted our wedding night to be perfect .
yes , but actors want opening night to be perfect .
that &apos;s why they rehearse .
it &apos;ll be better this way .
now , can i get you some more ice cream ?
not in that dress .
so , i need to ask you something .
ian , you know , from across the hall ?
you met him .
anyway , he sort of asked me out ,
on a date .
i know , you &apos;re thrown . i was thrown , too .
but he &apos;s really nice and ...
... i could sort of use someone to talk to ...
... who also talks back .
the thing is , i &apos;m sort of lonely
and the past six months have been really hard on me .
so what i need is ...
... i need to know if it &apos;s ok with you if i go out with him .
because if it &apos;s not , i won &apos;t .
i &apos;d like nothing better than for you to just wake up
and tell me not to go out with him .
just wake up and tell me .
wake up . please .
all right .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
i love you .
it is really just dinner .
i &apos;m just dropping off carlos and
then i &apos;ll be by to pick her up .
ok . thanks , edie .
xiao mei &apos;s fine . crisis averted . no harm , no foul .
how can you say that ? you endangered the life of our baby today .
don &apos;t you dare give me that attitude .
you have no idea what i &apos;ve been going through these past six months .
here we go .
i have had to wait hand and foot on your mistress .
imagine if the day after you found out about john rowland ,
you had to make his lunch and rub his feet .
john rowland wasn &apos;t carrying our kid .
forgive me for being concerned about our surrogate .
xiao mei is going to be fine .
once that baby comes , her slate is wiped clean .
she &apos;s gonna walk away , go off and live her american dream .
me ? i &apos;m gonna be stuck , a single mother raising a child alone ,
haggling with lawyers on who gets the kid at christmas .
my american dream is officially dead .
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
just so you know , my dream hasn &apos;t exactly ...
ok , so we will see you saturday .
and please pretend to be surprised . bye .
you told someone else ?
bree . the whole point of
the party was to announce our engagement .
i just can &apos;t help it . i like telling people .
it makes me feel ... i don &apos;t know .
it makes me feel like i &apos;m starting over .
it feels good .
feels good to me , too .
no hands , see ?
you don &apos;t have to wash those . i already did them .
i found some streaks , so i &apos;m
wiping them down with undiluted red wine vinegar .
i &apos;ve never heard of that .
sure . but for tougher spots ,
i use a fifty @-@ fifty mix of denatured alcohol and water .
and for those really intractable stains ,
i mean , we &apos;re talking shower doors ,
i wipe on lacquer thinner with a towel .
bree ?
oh , orson .
excuse me .
did you lose something ?
no , i just thought ... for you ...
i don &apos;t do that .
why not ?
i &apos;m a republican .
i &apos;m a libertarian .
i believe in minimizing the role of the state
and maximizing individual rights .
but , orson ...
trust me . i know what i &apos;m doing .
ok .
oh , no .
what ?
you didn &apos;t just crack that veneer again ?
i have to go .
go ? go where ?
then it was like something inside ruptured .
well , not so much a rupture as a spasm .
waves of this hot , clutching ...
i think i might have had a small stroke .
how severe were the pains ?
that &apos;s the odd thing .
i mean , there was no pain , per se .
in fact , it wasn &apos;t entirely unpleasant .
what were you doing at the time ?
i was with my fiance ? we were lying down ... resting .
i &apos;m gonna take a wild swing here . were you having sex ?
sort of .
ms. van de kamp , i think you may have had an orgasm .
no , no , no . i &apos;ve had orgasms before .
how would you describe them ?
that warm sensation ,
that tingling feeling of relief when it &apos;s over .
no , no . this was much ...
better ?
yes .
that &apos;s &apos; cause it was an orgasm .
well , i &apos;ll be darned .
let me have one .
here you go .
it &apos;s beautiful .
hi . can i help you ?
are you bree van de kamp ?
yes . and you are ?
carolyn bigsby . i was orson &apos;s neighbor .
well , come on in . let &apos;s dry you off and get you a drink .
i didn &apos;t come here to celebrate .
carolyn .
engaged again ? that was quick work .
does she know you killed your wife ?
my wife left me .
and no one ever heard from her again .
not me , not her family .
just dropped off the face of the earth .
orson , what is she talking about ?
didn &apos;t tell you that part , did he ?
all right , carolyn , you &apos;ve made your little scene .
you keep your hands off me .
don &apos;t let him fool you .
get away from him now while you can .
please leave my house .
fine .
be a fool . marry him .
just don &apos;t be surprised when you go missing , too .
i &apos;m sorry you had to endure that .
your wife ... disappeared ?
i tried to find her .
her family claimed not to have heard from her .
personally , i think she was just trying to punish me .
so ... are you still married ?
no . i was granted a divorce on grounds of abandonment .
bree .
you can &apos;t possibly think that ...
no , of course not .
i love you .
and i love you .
orson , my hand .
the buffet is open .
bree ?
it &apos;s gorgeous , just gorgeous .
every storm brings with it hope
that &apos;s somehow , by morning ,
everything will be made clean again
and even the most troubling stains will have disappeared .
like the doubts over his innocence .
or the consequence of his mistake .
like the scars of his betrayal .
or the memory of his kiss .
so we wait for the storm to pass , hoping for the best ...
... even though we know in our hearts
some stains are so indelible ,
nothing can wash them away .
