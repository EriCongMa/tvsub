leave me .
hal , my son ,
when you read this letter i shall be dead .
i leave you the throne of hebalon .
you have not yet been to war ,
and been part of the evil that has darkened our lives for centuries .
the ancient hatered between us and the zeriths ,
in which i myself played such a large part .
i cannot forgive myself ,
i wish to die , hal .
do what i could not .
create peace and justice between ourselves and the zeriths .
but beware of nezo , my wicked brother ,
and his treacherous henchman ghrak .
as for your sister ,
do not let her leave your side .
guard her more closely than your own life .
my son , it is time now that i cut my head @-@ string
and end my life .
a life that has taken so much ,
but given so little .
&quot; my wicked brother ... &quot;
you get a mention too , ghrak .
what an honour , nezo .
this is our chance .
so you think that death will set you free , dear brother ?
it won &apos;t be that easy .
your miserable suicide will be our little secret .
so , what shall we tell your beloved son ?
we &apos;ll tell him , that this night the zeriths have murdered his father .
yes . no , not just the zeriths , but sahro ,
their brutal and much @-@ feared leader .
you see , dear brother ? you and i are bound together .
and you will be the one to rule hebalon .
not your spoilt , gilded ,
self @-@ obsessed , arrogant and childish son .
let us fetch the golden boy .
it &apos;s time for him to be off and avenge his father &apos;s death .
hal tara ,
you pitiful wretch ,
what is yours shall be mine .
have i not waited long and patiently .
i have lived in your shadow like trash .
like the dirt you tread on with gilded feet .
hal !
erito ! what are you doing here ?
you have to come with me ...
it &apos;s your father .
my father ? what &apos;s happened ?
jhinna .
hal ! the zeriths have murdered our father .
look . their mark .
sahro ?
they have cut him down , all of him .
not one of his strings is left .
father !
the kharo is dead .
close the gates , seal all exits .
hebalon has asked for peace ,
but sahro and his fanatical horde of zeriths
have sent us a clear message .
there will be no peace .
no one can feel safe now .
tell the people to stay indoors !
hebalon is at war !
mother , i &apos;m stuck ! i can &apos;t get down !
come on . that &apos;s it . this way .
hal tara , this is ridiculous !
keep the mask on ! you &apos;re sahro !
come on ! this mask doesn &apos;t make me sahro ,
and it doesn &apos;t make you a mighty warrior .
hal . stop .
listen to me !
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
if i had really been sahro ,
you wouldn &apos;t just have lost your hand , there .
you &apos;d have lost your head @-@ string .
but i almost had you .
this is serious business , hal .
you &apos;re the kharo &apos;s son , not a warrior .
i am a general .
let me take care of the zeriths .
stay here , hal .
you &apos;re going to be the kharo .
dream on , erito . you wooden head .
hal , my son ,
when you read this letter i shall be dead .
father !
what is happened ?
nothing .
but your hand ?
mind your own business .
erito will take care of it .
attention , you lot !
you &apos;re in luck , sir ,
we &apos;ve got pretty much everything in stock right now .
hands , feet , good strong knees , sturdy thighs .
stand still for the general !
we found this one up north of the nordessa forest .
good climate up there , so he ain &apos;t got no rot on him .
what d &apos;you need ?
a hand .
who for ?
for hal tara .
oh well , take a look at this one , then .
pure oak that is , last a lifetime .
ready for painting ,
haven &apos;t seen hands good as that in a long while .
i &apos;ll take it .
the whole world wounds with you , my chidren .
the unthinkable has happened ,
and a great disaster has overtaken us .
lie still , will you ?
we have searched the entire city .
we fear sahro slipped away before we closed the city gates .
lie still , i tell you !
with all my love i suffer with you , my children .
i too am sick with grief at losing my beloved brother
but hebalon awaits its new kharo , hal .
no , no !
just shut up !
no , no .
off with it ! lie still , i tell you ! there . done .
no !
your hand &apos;s on its way , sir .
fine .
your new hand .
excellent .
if anyone is to find sahro , let it be me .
let me offer my life to avenge my brother !
i &apos;ll have no one say
you weren &apos;t man enough to avenge your father .
me ?
yes .
i am ready .
for what ?
erito , pack up our gear . we leave immediately .
what are you talking about ?
maybe a whole army can &apos;t find them , but we two can .
we &apos;ll travel in disguise . find me some slave &apos;s clothing .
and a hodu @-@ painter .
but it &apos;s tonight that father is to ...
you &apos;re to be crowned kharo , am i right ?
who is giving the orders here ?
you cannot go and find the zeriths just like that .
i &apos;ll find them .
and just how do you think they
were able to enter a city like hebalon undetected ?
so far , so good .
but what about erito ?
we &apos;ll never get him on our side .
we won &apos;t only get him on our side , nezo .
we &apos;ll get him to do our dirty work .
father , come and watch !
hal is being painted .
why are you being painted , hal ?
don &apos;t you want to be gold anymore ?
it &apos;s so that the zeriths can &apos;t recognise me .
why mustn &apos;t the zeriths recognise you ?
isn &apos;t it passed your bedtime ?
dad , hal &apos;s scared of sahro and the zeriths .
i &apos;m not scared .
erito and eike , isn &apos;t it passed your children &apos;s bedtime ?
yes , it is .
mommy , i can &apos;t find my sleeping bird .
it &apos;s right here .
maybe i should have chosen another piece of wood .
something darker , smoother ...
she &apos;s perfect , erito .
she &apos;s done . i couldn &apos;t wish for a more wonderful child .
but her hands ... are her fingers too delicate ?
should i have ... ?
don &apos;t worry yourself .
leave her be .
who will stand by you , eike , when your time comes ?
i have been through this before , my love .
eike . take good care of xath and daya !
you speak as though you will never come back again .
promise me that you won &apos;t find any zeriths .
i have to go . orders are orders .
i wish you were staying here .
mommy , where is it ? i can &apos;t sleep if i don &apos;t have my bird .
it &apos;s right here .
the little fellow &apos;s bird .
father ,
hebalon will not be at peace
until the last zerith has forfeited his strings .
when i step through the city gates tomorrow ,
no one shall enter or leave
until i have found sahro and avenged my father &apos;s murder .
while i &apos;m gone , nezo shall rule in my place .
don &apos;t be afraid , jhinna .
remember what father always used to say
that sideon guides our strings together .
when the gates have closed behind me ,
no one will enter hebalon .
you are completely safe here .
hal , you mustn &apos;t go .
i have no choice . jhinna .
let go of my strings !
don &apos;t leave me . it will be the death of me .
let go of me , jhinna !
help me !
how can they live like that ?
they are slaves , the army has taken their strings .
but what about the chidren ?
they are for breeding .
new slaves , new strings .
let &apos;s make camp for the night .
erito .
ghrak ?
some good advice for a silver @-@ stringed lord ...
i don &apos;t need your advice , old man .
you &apos;re getting it anyway .
don &apos;t return to hebalon with hal alive .
are you threatening me ?
no . i am delivering a message .
if hal returns to hebalon alive ,
you &apos;ll never see your family again .
i don &apos;t take my orders from you .
perhaps this will remind you
what happens if you disobey kharo nezo .
xath , my boy ...
erito !
erito !
erito , where are you ?
sahro ?
no !
sahro ?
you were dreaming .
no dream .
a nightmare .
can zeriths really jump like that ?
go back to sleep . it &apos;s a long way to the great market .
and we have a hard journey before us .
&quot; strings in heaven , myself on earth .
thus should it be from the day of our birth . &quot;
you shouldn &apos;t be in here , xath .
neither should you . and i &apos;m looking for my bird , that &apos;s all .
xath ? daya ?
quick , tangle .
where are you ?
tangle .
what a tangle you &apos;re in .
you have to sort us out , mom .
is this getting you all knotted up ?
no it &apos;s me . i &apos;m tangled up in your ...
now then . this string belongs ...
tell him to stop tugging on my head @-@ string , mother !
don &apos;t move , stay still !
i can &apos;t when he &apos;s moving around the whole time .
this one .
no .
hal , my son ,
when you read this letter i shall be dead .
i leave you the throne of hebalon .
this is just your fault too , xath , because you &apos;re so clumsy .
i miss daddy .
sweet , sweet ola .
you &apos;re doing your best to cheer me up , aren &apos;t you ?
eike ?
jhinna .
what is it ?
i want you to read this .
&quot; when you read this letter , i shall be dead ... &quot;
it &apos;s his farewell letter .
what ?
your father wasn &apos;t murdered . he took his own life .
&quot; bring about peace and justice between ourselves and the zeriths . &quot;
we have to get away from here .
it can only be nezo .
are you listening to me ?
what is it ?
hal and erito must see this letter .
meet me by the city gate just before midnight .
and make sure no one sees you .
but eike , we can &apos;t get out .
and who is going to be at your side
when life comes to the new one ?
then you &apos;ll have to help me .
yes .
remember !
the city gate , just before midnight .
it &apos;ll be fine .
yes .
as far as i can see you lot never do anything
but sit here and wash your husbands &apos; clothes .
can &apos;t they do that for themselves ?
you know what , zita , once you feel your strings twanging with love
you &apos;ll want to go through fire and water for your beloved ,
you can be sure of that .
and through piles of dirty washing too ?
speak of the sun and it shines , see how her strings quiver .
that &apos;s what happened to zita , too .
what did l tell you ? you &apos;re in love , zita .
erito .
no , i &apos;m not .
what are we doing here ?
searching for the zeriths , right ?
yes , but ...
we need to ask the one @-@ stringed for counsel .
the one @-@ stringed ?
l thought all that was just old superstition and mumbo @-@ jumbo .
maybe . i &apos;ll go in alone .
erito ?
father .
visit the one @-@ stringed , find out all about your future ,
don &apos;t miss out all the truth .
i am looking for the zeriths .
i will pay well for reliable information .
zeriths ? don &apos;t know nothing about them .
i have come to ask for your help .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
kill the boy !
did you hear that , everybody ? the rumours are true .
the kahro is dead !
down with the tyrant !
may he fall , never to rise again !
well now , i hear you &apos;re looking for the zeriths ,
or am i mistaken ?
slay him !
he is bound to his father &apos;s destiny .
in thrall to generations of wickedness ,
tyranny and lies !
this , i see clearly .
you are becoming entangled in his net ,
but he is not worth obeying .
set yourselves free from your doubts
and fears .
take him down to the lake of the thousand dead warriors
and there let him atone
for the genocide !
let him be an offering for peace !
are you one of those freedom fighters , then ?
maybe . and you ?
i think i &apos;ve seen you somewhere before .
let us be on our way .
but erito , this girl says she knows where to find ...
let &apos;s get going . we &apos;ve to get to the lake of the thousand dead warriors .
the lake of the thousand dead warriors ?
come .
didn &apos;t the one @-@ stringed say that ?
we must cross the nordessa pass befor daybreak .
did they say that ?
run over there !
halt !
who goes there ? halt !
eike , where are the children ?
eike ?
and where are you going at this late hour , my pretty ?
what have you done with eike ? let me go !
what do you think happens , when you set your self up against me ?
it can &apos;t be worse than having to look at you .
you think you can fool me , do you ?
silly girl . that sort of thing can get you killed .
let her go !
don &apos;t forget what we agreed , nezo .
but she can compromise us .
we had a deal , nezo .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
saving your life !
take her away !
hal shall learn the truth .
everyone shall learn the truth about my father &apos;s death .
and then we &apos;ll see
how popular you are in hebalon , uncle nezo ,
you and your crippled friend .
if father had known
what a miserable traitor you are , nezo ,
she &apos;s mine .
he would have hanged you with your own sick strings .
is that you , jhinna ?
eike ?
help me ...
what &apos;s happening ?
listen , they are singing .
it &apos;s time .
now ?
don &apos;t be afraid . i &apos;ll take care of everything .
prepare !
bless her !
holy sideon !
holy zion !
connect this body to all life !
fasten her strings good and tight !
they &apos;re so thin and fine ...
can you reach them ?
yes .
look , it &apos;s coming to life .
careful of the head @-@ string , jhinna !
that &apos;s the most important one .
the head @-@ string .
look how beautiful she is .
thank you , jhinna .
take the woman and the child and
throw them down with the rest of erito &apos;s brood .
i &apos;ll be back shortly .
this is the lake of the thousand dead warriors .
my father has spoken of it .
he won a great victory over the zeriths here , didn &apos;t he ?
hal ,
where are you ?
help me !
bring in the slaves !
i am the kharo &apos;s daughter .
i order you to set me free !
the kharo is dead , jhinna ,
but i am alive .
i am alive .
do you understand , jhinna ?
i was your father &apos;s commander @-@ in @-@ chief .
i was good at it .
your father &apos;s favorite .
he had promised me something very beautiful ... you .
when you had grown to womanhood , you were to be mine .
what are you saying ?
i was the most important men in hebalon .
have you never heard tale of
the great battle by the sideon river ?
no .
the three @-@ day desert war ?
no .
what about the battle on the lake of the thousand dead warriors .
does that mean anything to you ?
yes .
that was the battle i lost .
the zeriths had defeated us north of the nordessa forest .
your father was filled with rage .
as we were retreating ,
we came upon a caravan of zerith women and childrens .
your father could not handle his defeat .
in his rage , he blamed me .
he ordered me to slay the women and children ,
and when i refused , he attacked me .
he cut all my strings except my head @-@ string and one arm .
then he abandoned me by the lake .
if i got home , i was to allowed to live .
defeat enraged your father .
overcome by evil and darkness ,
he killed them all .
but they are all women and children .
my father would never ever do such a thing .
but he did .
i had to get what i could get , afterward .
during the long campaign ,
the army had used up all the decent spare parts from slaves ,
and only old , worn @-@ out ones were left , jhinna .
i had to take what i could get .
he is no older than your son , erito .
did my father really killed them all ?
suppose this hand reached out and caressed you tonight ?
no ?
then this one ?
it can be yours , if you want it .
i &apos;ll be hebalon &apos;s commander @-@ in @-@ chief again ,
with you by my side .
i can be put together any way you choose !
let the slaves go ! this is wrong !
what ?
i can love you the way you are .
really ?
no , jhinna , you can learn to love me .
no .
no .
erito , what are you doing ?
stop ! erito .
i have to do this .
forgive me .
you don &apos;t understand .
stop !
what don &apos;t i understand ?
answer me !
what don &apos;t i understand ?
spare my life , hal .
spare me . for the sake of my children ,
for my boy .
i &apos;ve always trusted you , erito .
i have never betrayed you ,
and now you turn on me .
hal !
traitor !
traitor !
traitor !
help ! help !
sahro ?
take him away .
take your hands off me !
come on . come on , i say ! come now !
no , let go of me .
anything you want to say in your defence before you die ?
what have i done ?
come now , we know you &apos;re spying for hebalon .
no .
then explain why you &apos;re carry a hebalonian sword ?
i found it out by the lake .
he &apos;s lying !
look at me . i &apos;m just a poor nomad .
my father is dead , and i &apos;m traveling west to escape the war .
what war ?
they say that hebalon is planning for war ,
to avenge my ... the murder of the kharo .
shall we bring him along , or should we finish him here ?
no !
you .
still some kind of freedom fighter ?
were they rough on you ?
just a little .
does your life hang by a thread ?
i don &apos;t care who you are , you deserve better treatment than this .
you &apos;ve saved my little scumbag of my brother &apos;s life ,
and for that i &apos;ll always be grateful .
my name is zita .
where are you taking me ?
wherever we decide to take you ,
we need to know whose side you are on .
so tell me , stranger with no name , whose side are you on ?
my own .
hebalon .
meet your new husband , ghrak ,
commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the hebalon army .
i &apos;d rather die .
as you wish ,
kharia jhinna .
aren &apos;t they beautiful ?
yes .
they are dancing the story of our people .
those are the siads from abagos .
abagos ?
yes .
our lost city .
abagos .
once , we all lived as one people in abagos .
the hebalonians came and drove us out .
they destroys everything , murdered and raped .
since then , we have had to live as fugitives .
is that true ?
yes . didn &apos;t you know ?
hebalon is built upon the ruins of abagos .
we have never given up hope of one day reclaiming our city .
how on earth did he do that ?
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it !
zita ?
zita ?
do you want to know our secret , how we leap ,
then come with me !
now look up .
can you see where you end ?
no . can you ?
i end where you begin ,
and where you end , i begin .
in that way we are all connected .
connected ?
look !
what ?
we are guiding each other .
when you learn to be guided by love ,
then you can use its strength ,
with dwells in all life , not just your own .
then you can do as we do ,
move like the wind .
now , you try !
agra ?
is that you , zita ?
i could tell it was time .
yes .
listen to me !
sideon came to me last night in a dream .
he said , many strings will fall to earth
and the sky will burn .
but he who shines like gold
will guide his people through these times .
who is he ? i asked ,
a stranger everywhere , both at home and abroad ,
to himself and to others ,
he answered and then he was gone .
now i can let go .
you must take over .
he who shines like gold .
agra !
sahro , yes .
zita !
going around spying on us , are you ?
tell us who you really are , or i &apos;ll ...
lhosa !
you are sahro .
so tell me your name , now that you know mine .
gladly . i am hal tara of hebalon ,
son of the kharo whom you murdered ,
and i have come for my revenge .
let &apos;s just kill him !
he who shines like gold .
let me kill him !
remember , hal .
if you are not bound by love ,
then you are tied by hate .
come on now , come ...
let him go .
you heard what the lady said .
take him out into the desert and let him rot .
welcome home , erito .
where &apos;s eike ?
where &apos;s my family ?
where &apos;s hal ?
he is dead .
i swear on the strings of my un @-@ born child .
the zeriths took him .
really ? and where are the zeriths , then ?
closer than we thought .
they have a secret route through the nordessa forest .
they &apos;re camped west of the lake of the thousand dead warriors .
where is eike ?
nice work , erito , very nice .
your first task as commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the hebalonian army
will be to wipe them out for all time .
i ?
you ? no , my friend ,
you are relieved of your command .
say hello to your successor .
erito .
erito ! you are alive !
eike !
look ! look , our child !
dad , dad !
xath !
i &apos;ve got it
i &apos;ve got your sleeping bird .
here , here come , come
i can &apos;t reach .
reach out !
where have you been ?
i looked everwhere for you .
erito , erito listen .
where &apos; s hal ?
he &apos; s coming back to save us , isn &apos;t he ?
isn &apos;t he ?
no .
hebalon is a closed city !
only slavedrivers will be let in now .
sahro .
get him !
lay hold of his leg @-@ string .
he &apos;s heavy , this one .
god . has to be solid mahogany .
i am hal tara of hebalon .
take your hands off me !
you shut your trap !
do you realise who i am ?
i am the son of the kharo .
this idiot &apos;s got desert fever .
let go of me !
we &apos;ve got him ,
make ready ?
come on then , time is a @-@ wasting !
hebalon &apos;s off to war , and the army needs new strings .
come on , kharo son , push !
show us what you are made of !
push , you miserable creature !
push !
put your back into it ,
push , you ...
i recognise you , kharo son .
i do recognise you . you have my hand .
shut up down there !
push !
what a sorry pair we are , ola .
soon , we &apos;ll be done for .
you poor sad old bird , why can &apos;t you fly ?
if you could only fly , ola , the two of us would be saved .
come on , ola . you can do it .
set us free ! come on .
set us free .
i can take you to freedom .
i am all you have left , jhinna .
your brother is dead .
the zeriths took him . you must believe me .
no . in heaven our strings are touching .
jhinna
hal &apos;s and mine
it feels as though
someone is playing the most wonderful music on my strings .
as though they are vibrating .
just listen !
i can tell he &apos;s alive and that he will return .
wait and see .
tonight i dreamed of sideon !
he was disguised as an old zerith ,
his voice sounded like
the wind blowing through the dry grass on the great plains .
some people are bound together , ghrak .
like hal and me ,
like the man who loses his hand
and the slave who gives him a new one .
if you feel , then you &apos;ll know it &apos;s true .
yes .
and to whom are you bound , ghrak ?
my father , who robbed you of your strength and beauty ?
to nezo ?
to those from whom you took your body parts ?
not to me .
whatever you do to me , i will never ever be yours .
well then , i cannnot help you .
goodbye , jhinna .
guard !
take them down there !
hal !
erito ?
hal ? is that really you ?
how did you end up here ?
that &apos;s a very long story .
listen carefully !
jhinna and i found your father &apos;s farewell letter .
he wasn &apos;t murdered , hal .
he took his own life
so that he could leave the throne to you .
so that you could accomplish what he never could .
we have found the zeriths .
i have deployed the army and we should defeat this evil .
but there is also evil within hebalon itself .
this is what happens when you betray your own people .
you should have listened to ghrak .
now i have no choice .
everyone has a choice .
so the whole thing is a lie .
everything .
our whole life .
it is we who are the enemy .
we are our own worst enemy .
ola .
something is happened to jhinna .
abagos .
zita was right .
hebalon belongs to the zeriths .
i end where you begin ,
and where you end , i begin .
and in that way we are all connected .
when you learn to be guided by love ,
you will be able to use the strength that dwells in all life .
i got him , dad .
don &apos;t move , stay where you are .
i &apos;m letting go of the grille .
stay where you are
hal , you are alive !
no , jhinna , stay with me .
promise me you &apos;ll do what our father said , hal .
he asked you to live in peace .
you must do that .
in peace and love , hal !
promise me .
you must !
yes , i promise .
we are bound together in heaven , the two of us .
it is you who plays that beautiful music , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
jhinna , no .
no ! !
oh no ! hal , look out !
it &apos;s over , kharo nezo .
too late , hal .
thanks to you ,
the army has long since been sent against the zeriths .
it was so nice of you to locate them for us .
don &apos;t delude yourself . you &apos;re a son of hebalon !
you &apos;re like me , like your father ,
you can &apos;t run away from that .
so come on then , you miserable coward , kill me !
no .
i am like my father .
in the last few seconds of his life .
i am beginning where he ends ,
i shall have the strength to do what he did not .
besides , i &apos;ve promised a friend to use this hand to something good .
yes !
can you see them ?
we are surrounded .
the hebalonians are just beyond the forest .
i told you , we should have killed him .
summon our men .
hal .
they must have a special route .
we &apos;ll never get in there alive .
oh yes we will . we &apos;ll burn our way through .
why isn &apos;t anything happening ?
why aren &apos;t they attacking ?
all we can do is wait .
how long are we going to wait ?
mother , what are we waiting for ?
hush , now !
look . the sun is coming up .
that &apos;s not the sun .
take up your positions !
fill the traps with water .
the moment is at hand .
move out !
i want sahro taken alive !
onwards i say .
kill men , women and children .
let no one be spared .
this night will see the end of the zeriths .
by dawn , hebalon will be victorious and they will be ashes .
search the forest , search under every stone !
find them !
but remember .
sahro is mine alone .
the camp is abandoned . the zeriths must have fled .
no .
they are here !
up there , in the trees ! take him down !
well , what have we here .
i want him alive .
make way , there !
a woman .
well , you &apos;re going to die anyway .
ghrak ! let her go !
