oh , ok .
oh , great costume .
yeah , you , too .
that was awkward .
oh , my god . we used to come every year .
i can &apos;t believe he brought someone else .
well , you brought someone else .
yeah . someone i couldn &apos;t possibly be sexually attracted to .
you &apos;re welcome ?
whoa , rossi !
why doesn &apos;t this surprise me ?
are you here for the convention ?
who schedules a cigar aficionado event
back to back with ... this ?
i know , right ? it &apos;s the greatest party ever .
well , it was gonna be .
unless it involves gentleman jack
and pre @-@ embargo cuban cigars ,
i find that statement to be highly dubious .
kevin brought another woman .
i &apos;m plotting revenge . do you want to help ?
no .
now , you know i love you both ,
but this is saturday and it is my day off ,
so i &apos;d prefer to love you from afar .
so , have fun .
it &apos;s my bedtime .
it &apos;s 9 a.m.
you &apos;re judging me ?
thank you .
thanks .
i don &apos;t know .
emily , what &apos;s not to know ?
it &apos;s a beautiful place .
there are cracks in the foundation .
cracks can be fixed .
no , they can only be hidden .
they &apos;re still there .
what , are you afraid the place is gonna fall down ?
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s never gonna be as strong as it was .
ok , somebody &apos;s heart is not into it .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
when i first came here ,
i felt like i was home .
and now , it &apos;s just an uphill battle .
people kill for opportunities like this .
am i crazy to walk away ?
well , you gotta do what &apos;s best for you .
follow your gut .
what &apos;s it trying to tell you ?
thank you .
it &apos;s ok , ma &apos;am . go ahead .
did you remember to bring your key ?
yes .
did you remember your glasses ?
yes . nag , nag , nag .
over here , sir .
i &apos;m gonna need to see your bag .
ok , sure .
over here , sir .
it looks like everyone &apos;s setting that thing off today .
sir , over here .
oh , god .
i want to see hands in the sky !
now !
try to trigger any alarm or give me any damn dye packs
and you &apos;re dead .
you understand ? do you understand ? !
yes !
cash in here .
cash in here .
go , buddy .
come on !
time !
1 : 45 . yes , ladies and gentlemen ,
we are the face cards . maybe you &apos;ve heard of us .
get your faces on the floor already .
i see eyes , you see bullets . get it ?
get down on the ground !
get down on the ground !
1 : 30 .
what the hell is that ? !
i said no dye packs .
what the hell is this ?
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , she &apos;s sorry . sorry ?
you &apos;re gonna be sorry .
please . we &apos;ll cooperate .
just tell me what you need .
what i need ?
well ...
lynne ...
this is a bank , right ?
what do you think i need ?
oh . take me to the vault , sweetie pie .
go . go !
one minute .
all units in the vicinity off penn and southeast ,
robbery in progress at colonial liberty bank .
that &apos;s one block over .
shot fired . repeat , shots fired at
the colonial liberty bank . all units .
426 responding .
30 seconds , boss .
all right , coming .
on the ground with the others .
we got trouble !
what do you mean ?
black @-@ and @-@ white .
get down . down ! down !
side door . let &apos;s go !
faces on the ground .
count to 100 . don &apos;t even think of moving .
i said count !
better pull back and see if they respond .
10 @-@ 13 . officer down .
shots fired . repeat , shots fired .
&quot; fear is met and destroyed with courage . &quot;
james f. bell .
you ok ?
yeah .
it &apos;s definitely them .
i only saw the king and the jack ,
but i figure the queen &apos;s inside , too .
the media &apos;s calling them the face cards .
7 bank robberies in 7 months .
they &apos;ve killed one person at each robbery .
m.o. ?
single gunshot wound . each of the victims has bled out .
serial killers with a 30 @-@ day cooling @-@ off period
and we &apos;re only just hearing about this now ?
well , headquarters has always characterized them
robbers first and killers second .
no one kills 7 people without
serious psychopathic tendencies .
i disagreed with the original assessment . i was overruled .
so why are we here now ?
because crisis negotiation is overseas .
what more do we know about them ?
they &apos;re organized , they &apos;re efficient .
each strike lasts about 2 minutes .
they gotta be scouting the banks in advance .
why haven &apos;t we been able to i.d. them off of surveillance footage ?
they hack the security feed and turn off the cameras ,
both during the initial canvass and during the robbery ,
until the masks come back on , and then we &apos;re allowed to watch .
i can &apos;t find anything . no doors , no grates , nothing .
yo ! lynne ! what &apos;s another way out of here ?
just the main entrance and the side door . it &apos;s for security .
i know that . you think i &apos;m stupid ?
what went wrong ? we were on count .
i need a doctor .
is anyone a doctor ? !
would you shut that kid up !
he &apos;s a baby . what do you expect her to do ?
it &apos;s ok , baby . it &apos;s ok .
no one asked for your opinion .
it &apos;s not just the cops .
we &apos;ve got the feds now , too . we &apos;re screwed .
you have to apply pressure .
i can &apos;t even feel it .
yeah , i know . just push down as hard as you can .
would you focus on what &apos;s important .
shut the hell up ! he &apos;s bleeding out .
it &apos;s his fault we &apos;re in this mess .
nice heads @-@ up on the cops , olly .
maybe think it was your count that was off , huh ?
how bad is it ?
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
i don &apos;t want to die .
we &apos;re all gonna die if we don &apos;t get out of here .
you shot a cop .
shut the hell up !
you &apos;re not gonna die .
we &apos;re trapped in here , ok .
but we got one thing they want--
all them .
they &apos;re using the hostages as human shields .
this is the first time they &apos;ve been interrupted . what went wrong ?
it &apos;s a big bank .
it &apos;s possible they weren &apos;t about to round everybody up
before someone triggered an alarm .
why haven &apos;t they cut the feed now that they &apos;ve been cornered ?
letting us see inside gives up a tactical advantage .
they gotta know that .
they don &apos;t seem to care .
they &apos;re overconfident . arrogant , even .
the face card masks add to their narcissism .
their personas are the royalty of poker .
jj , reid , and prentiss , look at past robberies .
that &apos;s gonna be our victimology .
pull another analyst if you need to .
dave , i want you to handle negotiations .
and , morgan , strategize tactical options with mpd .
chief strauss .
the director ordered me to supervise your operation .
puts you right in the spotlight .
well , you &apos;ve got gunmen with hostages in the capital .
the hill &apos;s concerned .
we &apos;re about to open lines of communication .
what about a tactical assault ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea .
there are hostages in front of the doors and windows .
what &apos;s your negotiation strategy ?
the jack &apos;s bleeding out .
they &apos;ll ask for medical attention .
the female unsub might have something to say about that .
look at her body language .
she is cold and detached .
the king seems genuinely concerned about his partner &apos;s welfare .
but she couldn &apos;t give a damn .
the men probably know each other .
garcia ?
yes .
shuffling my technofabulous deck of databases , sir .
hey , don &apos;t look .
it &apos;s gonna be ok .
we &apos;re all gonna die , aren &apos;t we ?
i &apos;m sure the police will give them what they want .
stop talking !
it &apos;s gotta be the feds .
i &apos;ll be right back .
who the hell &apos;s this ?
my name is david rossi . i &apos;m with the fbi .
to whom am i speaking ?
all right , i want a doctor sent in ,
and then i want out of here .
well , we certainly can discuss that .
let the hostages go
and we &apos;ll give you all the medical help you need .
i can &apos;t do that . i need the leverage .
how about a sign of good faith ?
send out the women and children
and i &apos;ll see what i can do .
he &apos;s trying to negotiate .
negotiate ? we &apos;re not playing games .
daddy !
no , no , no , please !
either we get what we want
or everyone in this room dies .
do that and you get nothing .
take me instead. please .
take me .
it &apos;s ok , baby .
daddy !
you better send in some help .
or more people are gonna die .
we &apos;re sending in a medic .
that &apos;s just gonna give them another hostage .
if they stop shooting people , it &apos;s worth it .
if we give in to one demand ,
we &apos;ll have to give in to them all .
the director disagrees .
at least make it an agent with medical training .
that way he can take advantage of an opportunity if it comes .
fine .
the brass thinks they &apos;ll act rationally ,
but there &apos;s no evidence of that .
this is personal for the men .
the king could have run after the initial gunfight ,
but he didn &apos;t .
instead , he pulled the partner inside out of harm &apos;s way .
and stayed with him ,
while the woman searched the bank , presumably for a way out .
he &apos;s more worried about the partner
than he is about her running away .
garcia , narrow your search .
i think the male unsubs might even be related .
roger that .
in 6 robberies no one &apos;s been able to build a sketch
of the unsubs before they put their masks on .
these witness descriptions are all over the map .
probably because of the trauma suffered inside .
they &apos;ve been zig @-@ zagging north and south
but in a relative straight pattern from washington , d.c.
this is the largest bank they &apos;ve hit .
before today , it &apos;s just been small branches in rural communities .
so today was always a part of their plan .
but why the nation &apos;s capital ?
to make a statement ?
i pulled schematics from the previous banks .
this is the first one with metal detectors .
maybe that &apos;s what went wrong ?
no , they cased the branches too well in advance .
they &apos;d know to be ready for them .
these are takeover robberies .
no faces , no passing notes , no prints .
they &apos;re professionals .
hey , there is something all these robberies have in common .
the queen &apos;s the only one who pulls the trigger .
sir , i found a thing .
see , i took height and weight measurements
and i crossed with known related offenders
who specialize in bank jobs and home burglaries--
show me . yes .
these are brothers chris and oliver stratton .
they are petty thieves from philly ,
turned bank robbers in jersey .
they were put in jail for two years
after an attempted heist went sour ,
and they were released two months before
the first face card robbery ,
and their measurements are a match .
when didn &apos;t the ncic database connect them ?
because the brothers have never used a third partner ,
and shooting people &apos;s not part of their m.o.
it looks like they weren &apos;t very successful criminals .
maybe adding a woman to their team improved their game .
the woman chose a different type of victim each time .
it &apos;s not just the security guard .
it &apos;s been a mother , a manager , and a young child .
she shoots them in the gut .
they bleed out while they rob the bank .
she &apos;s sadistic . she gets off on her victims &apos; pain
and the fear it incites in those around her .
move him out of here .
stay with me , oolly .
where &apos;s my medic ?
i don &apos;t see him .
kill someone else , then . make them listen .
it also appears the king
is in charge of the money @-@ grabbing operation
while the queen keeps track of time ,
making sure they &apos;re in an out in under two minutes .
she &apos;s more in control of the operation than they let on .
turning the king and queen against each other
could be the key to disarming them .
he &apos;s not a killer . that could be our in .
only if the jack doesn &apos;t die .
if he does ...
no , no , no . i want you to put that in your bag .
the woman &apos;s probably going to want to search you .
but chris is gonna be too focused on getting aid to his brother
to delay long enough for her to check the bag , too .
all right .
you &apos;re going in to provide medical assistance .
no unnecessary risks , you hear me ?
once you stabilize oliver , check on the hostage they just shot .
he might still be alive .
understood .
do not draw your weapon
unless you can subdue the unsubs without endangering the hostages .
yes , sir .
why hasn &apos;t anyone come in yet ?
we &apos;re sending in the medic now , chris .
tell oliver help is on the way .
hurry .
they know our names .
not all our names .
is she putting on lipstick ?
they &apos;re sending someone in .
chris .
olly , olly , no .
no , no , no , stay with me .
what are you doing ?
they &apos;re sending in a medic . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
i don &apos;t feel so fine .
no ! no ! no !
get over here !
you &apos;re gonna save him , right ?
i &apos;m gonna try .
oliver , can you hear me ?
come on , olly .
stay with me , oliver .
stay with me , oliver .
this is not good , aaron .
morgan , tell green to make a move before chris does .
green , you gotta go .
green , go .
oh , my god .
tactical &apos;s been deployed ,
snipers are moving into position .
the director &apos;s ordered a full tactical assault .
his last orders cost us an agent .
s.w.a.t. &apos; s getting itchy fingers .
you remind s.w.a.t. that bank robberies are federal jurisdiction .
no one fires until they &apos;re ordered to .
right .
all right , when the crossfire starts ,
what &apos;s gonna happen to the hostages caught in the middle ?
that &apos;s the wrong call , erin , and you know it .
it &apos;s not my call .
you &apos;re here and you &apos;re in charge .
so you want me to disobey the director ?
yes .
no , i just want you to buy us a little time .
don &apos;t be quite so efficient .
whatever you &apos;re gonna do , do it fast .
all right . reasoning with them is still our best option .
that &apos;ll be difficult . chris just lost his brother
and murdered someone in retaliation .
we &apos;re dealing with two killers now .
we have problems , sirs .
outside nefarious sources
have hacked into the surveillance feeds .
i &apos;m trying to i.d. them now .
at least a couple of them are media outlets .
can you block them ?
no , not without blocking ourselves , too , sir .
put him with the others .
hey ! everybody move forward 5 feet .
come on ! move forward 5 feet !
line up !
i &apos;m sorry about olly .
just shut up , would you .
we &apos;ve got to pull ourselves together , figure a way out of here .
what happened ?
who triggered the alarm ?
was it you ?
calm down . we need to focus .
call them back . demand an armored truck .
what , you think they &apos;re gonna let us go ?
we killed 4 people . two cops .
so what ? we don &apos;t try ?
that &apos;s just great .
why don &apos;t you walk over there .
i gotta think for a minute .
whatever you say ...
boss .
why &apos;d you have to make it so quick ?
it &apos;s better when they suffer .
i don &apos;t get off on it like you do .
you will .
look .
we &apos;re gonna be famous .
agent prentiss , there &apos;s a call for you from interpol .
take a message , please .
it &apos;s clyde easter .
your old unit chief ?
he says he has information about the queen of diamonds .
sorry i missed your funeral , by the way .
i was held up in prague .
so you &apos;re not surprised .
of course not .
keeping tabs on my former assets
is a particular skill of mine .
ok , what can you tell me about my mystery woman ?
ah , yes . well , um , if she seems familiar to you , she should .
we don &apos;t know her identity , but we &apos;ve seen her before .
she &apos;s struck a number of banks worldwide , including--
paris ! there was a robbery when i was relocated there .
someone died .
oh , yes . the bank manager , glenn harrison .
gut shot ?
yes . how did you know ?
i don &apos;t remember hearing
anything about the robber wearing a mask .
that &apos;s because she didn &apos;t .
she seems to be wearing disguises .
her faces has been seen on camera
by 6 different intelligence agencies
and no one can identify her .
how is that possible ? wait , who were her partners overseas ?
she didn &apos;t need any .
then why would she now ?
what if the smaller banks were training runs
from the stratton brothers ?
well , it could be . she took two relatively amateur thugs
and turned them into an elite team of efficient bank robbers .
but why ? to turn them into patsies ?
all right , ok , so let &apos;s look at it .
up until now they &apos;ve been highly organized ,
striking only on deposit days ,
when the most amount of cash is on hand .
but today &apos;s different . it &apos;s their first saturday hit ,
where families are present ,
more foot traffic throughout the day .
it &apos;s a riskier attack .
we should consider the media attention , too .
it &apos;s the first time they &apos;ve had an audience .
that might be why the female unsub is so vain .
she wants to look good for the cameras .
she searches the bank
but doesn &apos;t actually look for a means of escape .
she appears to be almost enjoying the situation .
we know the brothers are in it for the money .
what &apos;s she in it for ?
where the hell have you been ?
i &apos;ve been looking for an escape route .
there isn &apos;t one .
so much for your no back doors ,
no surprises plan . you screwed us .
then why don &apos;t you negotiate a way out of here already ?
what ?
how do you want to end this , chris ?
i want out of here .
how do you propose to do that ?
i want an armored truck
and a plane with a clear flight path to switzerland .
no , no , no . chad .
we want to go to chad .
yeah . no agents with guns this time .
we &apos;ll fly ourselves .
don &apos;t do that again .
i &apos;m in charge here .
ok , so what &apos;s the significance of chad ?
a 2008 coup attempt plunged them
into political instability .
they &apos;re currently in the middle of a civil war .
there &apos;s gotta be more to it than that .
our ghost wants to go to chad .
i &apos;m figuring you &apos;re my best chance of finding out why .
chad ? that &apos;s an odd choice .
they &apos;re not exactly hospitable this time of year .
they said they could fly themselves there .
nothing suggests that chris would have that ability , so she must .
well , unfortunately , interpol doesn &apos;t have many assets
in that particular region in africa .
maybe that &apos;s something
that you could help me with when this is over .
work for interpol again ? that &apos;ll be the day .
not work , darling . run .
you see , i &apos;ve been promoted .
so , the team &apos;s yours whenever you want it .
it &apos;s a hell of a time to bring that up .
well , you know , in our line of work , there &apos;s never a good time .
think about it .
please ?
you find me a connection i can use and maybe we &apos;ll discuss it .
the fbi &apos;s making good in its promise .
we &apos;ll be out of here soon .
we &apos;re taking him with us .
these guys were too good to get caught ,
so why did they ?
911 received a call alerting them to a robbery in progress .
actually , it was a text .
d.c. added 911 messaging
after the virginia tech students texts
went unanswered during the massacre .
can you trace it , garcia ?
yeah . the message was sent from a cell phone
that is currently inside the bank
and was registered to a larry phillips jr .
why does that name sound familiar ?
that &apos;s the name of one of the gunmen
from the &apos; 97 north hollywood bank shootout in california .
so is this an homage ?
guys , that text was sent 30 seconds before they blacked out
the security feeds for entry .
how is that possible ?
it didn &apos;t come from a hostage . it came from one of the robbers .
she wanted us here .
there &apos;s no clear line of sight to the vault .
no , but if we come in , that &apos;s where they &apos;ll go .
we need to be ready for it .
garcia caught us up .
why instigate a hostage situation ?
what &apos;s a narcissist without attention ?
she thrives on it .
she must have something bigger in mind .
we need to separate chris and the female
to find out what that is .
it &apos;s not going to be hard . they &apos;re already on edge .
it &apos;s more than the media outlets , sir .
anonymous international entities are hacking the feeds as well .
you were saying ?
i was tagging i.p. addresses and someone hacked
the surveillance cameras at 7 a.m. this morning .
was that how they shut down the cameras for entry ?
no , sir . this is an entirely different hack ,
one that &apos;s still receiving .
somebody else is watching . who ?
whoever it is she &apos;s dressing up for .
i thought that was for the media .
the media didn &apos;t have eyes inside before today .
but she dresses up every time .
because someone is always watching .
her real partner , a fourth unsub .
i doubt if she was forthcoming
about this other partner to chris .
i think it &apos;s time we bring chris up to speed .
you know my favorite card in poker , chris ?
what &apos;s that ?
the wild card .
i don &apos;t believe in wild cards .
they dumb down the game .
well , i couldn &apos;t agree with you more ,
but , uh , in this case , you &apos;re the one that &apos;s dumb .
this your new negotiation tactic , insulting me ?
oh , it &apos;s not a tactic .
it &apos;s a fact .
didn &apos;t you wonder why you got caught ,
what went wrong when you did everything right ?
we got a message from someone
in the bank before you started shooting .
impossible .
now , i know it wasn &apos;t you ,
and i &apos;m hoping it wasn &apos;t your brother .
so , who does that leave ?
you &apos;re lying .
ask her .
did you call the police ?
is that what they &apos;re telling you ?
that &apos;s not an answer .
of course not . what do you think ?
they &apos;re trying to turn us against one another .
why would you even do that ? olly &apos;s dead &apos; cause of that .
i wouldn &apos;t . i &apos;m trapped here , too .
are you lying to me ?
we &apos;ve come to far for you to start doubting me now .
lost too much .
don &apos;t let them tear us apart right as we &apos;re about to win .
if you do that ,
olly &apos;s death won &apos;t mean anything .
enough . i &apos;m done talking to you .
i want to talk to someone who won &apos;t jerk me around face to face .
no more feds .
i want to talk to the cop who shot my brother .
no . no , forget it .
jj , if it means we can end this ...
what makes you think he won &apos;t shoot you
the minute you walk inside ?
look , he wants out of there just as much as we want him out .
it &apos;s not happening . forget it .
there &apos;s no guarantee
he won &apos;t retaliate for the death of his brother .
i know you &apos;d do it if you were me .
will , i get what you &apos;re feeling ,
but you are too close to this case to make that call .
you &apos;re damn right i &apos;m close .
4 people are dead because i shot his brother .
and no one else needs to die &apos; cause of what i did .
this isn &apos;t about you .
risking your life won &apos;t bring them back .
sorry , will .
where &apos;s that cop , huh ? i ain &apos;t got all day .
what you &apos;re asking is difficult .
well , i &apos;ll make it easy .
send in the cop ,
i &apos;ll let a couple hostages go .
a sign of good faith . isn &apos;t that what you said ?
releasing the hostages is a great first step
in resolving this conflict ,
but we can &apos;t send someone else in to be killed .
this ain &apos;t a friggin &apos; debate .
come on , bud . let &apos;s go !
pick up the phone .
why ?
pick up the phone !
hello ?
tell him your name .
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s shawn harper .
you just killed shawn harper . not me , you .
i &apos;m gonna shoot another hostage every 60 seconds
until you send in the cop .
every 60 seconds .
who &apos;s next ?
he &apos;s threatening to shoot more hostages unless he has will .
screw this . i &apos;m going in .
no , you &apos;re not .
we are .
who &apos;s the lucky one ?
you !
no ! no .
pick it up .
come on .
what &apos;s your name ?
no , please .
tell him your name !
annie .
it &apos;s annie .
you hang in there , annie . help is on the way .
you got about 30 seconds , annie .
i hope agent rossi doesn &apos;t make me shoot you , too .
you ok ?
yes .
hey , you .
come over here .
no , i--
it &apos;s ok .
just let the women and children go .
they don &apos;t need to see this .
pretty soon they &apos;re gonna be doing a lot more than just seeing .
annie ! you just got yourself a reprieve .
get in line over there .
look at our new contender .
let &apos;s go !
go , go , go !
what is he doing ?
no . no , no , no .
no , no . morgan--
let me go , please !
i can &apos;t do that .
will ! will !
my name is matthew downs .
look .
let those people go .
all right , you , you , you . the kids . get out .
got 3 coming out . hold your fire .
thank you .
what &apos;s your name ?
william lamontagne jr . mpd .
did you see where he was shot ?
is he alive or dead , garcia ?
i don &apos;t know .
he was wearing a vest .
he might be ok .
might be .
they &apos;re not answering .
all right , we need to get inside .
jj , it &apos;s too risky .
we don &apos;t have eyes in there anymore .
aaron ...
let &apos;s go in .
hold your hands right there .
what are you doing ?
a dead cop isn &apos;t going to be much of a negotiation tool .
boss , are you good with this ?
what ? yeah , fine .
you ok ?
i shouldn &apos;t have done that .
they &apos;re never gonna let us out of here now .
who knows ? maybe they &apos;ll save him
and he &apos;ll be our ticket out of here .
you took my advice .
how &apos;s that ?
you didn &apos;t go for the kill shot .
right . i need to check the back again .
there &apos;s gotta be an escape we haven &apos;t thought of .
ok .
his blood pressure &apos;s dropping .
hold that . are you holding it as tight as you can ?
yeah .
how &apos;s jj ?
it &apos;s bad , reid .
i should be there .
we &apos;ve learned everything we can from here .
no , you can help more by helping me .
there &apos;s a lot to got over and your brain works faster than mine .
seeing what &apos;s going on outside doesn &apos;t help us inside .
kevin , can you possibly pull up each of the surveillance feeds
prior to will being shot ?
sure . what are we looking for ?
the female unsub disappeared once before .
if she was looking for an escape ,
what was she doing ?
i &apos;m sorry .
keep the pressure . keep the pressure . the pain won &apos;t kill him ,
but the loss of blood could .
just hang in there , buddy .
are you armed ?
no .
damn .
i think we might have something of a chance here .
what ?
the girl &apos;s gone , and the guy &apos;s off his head .
he doesn &apos;t know who to trust .
we can work them against each other .
wait , are you a cop ?
a former marine .
you gotta listen to me .
i need you to get a message to my girlfriend .
all right , you can tell her yourself when we get you out of here .
only i &apos;m not getting out .
you need someone to cause a distraction .
her name is jennifer ,
and she &apos;s a federal agent .
you tell her i &apos;m sorry .
sorry ?
don &apos;t you want to tell her you love her or something ?
she already knows that .
the woman .
what happened to her ?
aren &apos;t you dead yet ?
you can &apos;t trust her .
she &apos;s taking orders from someone else .
no , she takes orders from me .
look around .
any second agents are gonna storm into this place ,
and the only bad guy i see is you .
she &apos;s setting you up to take the fall for this , boy .
that &apos;s not true .
then where is she ?
she &apos;s back there .
all right . you .
come here .
i &apos;ll show you .
go on .
come on !
where are they going ?
he &apos;s giving us our chance .
we &apos;ve got movement .
somebody &apos;s coming out . be ready .
it &apos;s hostages .
copy . standing by for entry .
what the hell are you doing down here ?
calm down . you &apos;ll find out soon .
tell me .
we &apos;re going in .
she was following the electrical lines ...
gas mains . oh , no .
garcia , get them out of there !
abort ! abort !
jj !
jj , are you all right ?
are you ok ?
where &apos;s will ?
where is will ? did he get out of there ?
where &apos;s emily ?
jj !
will !
here i come !
police !
will !
emily !
there &apos;s been an explosion
at colonial liberty bank in the judicial district .
authorities right now at the scene
say they don &apos;t yet have a casualty ...
i can &apos;t get through . even the sat phone &apos;s got a busy signal .
what do we do ? what are we supposed to do ?
i &apos;m gonna get over there .
again , breaking news-- an explosion at colonial liberty bank ,
killing a possible 24 hostages
and an unknown number of law enforcement agents .
what is going on here ?
you didn &apos;t profile this as a suicide mission .
because it wasn &apos;t . they &apos;d never kill themselves .
what the hell do you call that , then ?
they didn &apos;t improvise a way out .
they &apos;ve had an exit strategy in place .
you don &apos;t learn explosives overnight .
we &apos;re looking for signatures on the bombs .
i need every fragment of every device that you can find ,
no matter how small or destroyed it looks .
i also need eyes on every angle in , out ,
and around the bank .
you have photos of the suspects .
we &apos;re going to continue to cross @-@ check those
against international connections .
do you have a positive i.d. on the woman yet ?
no . not yet .
we need more agents .
where &apos;s homeland security ?
they just got here .
sir , i &apos;ve see morgan and jj ,
but i haven &apos;t seen emily .
emily ?
over here !
you all right ?
yeah . they were hiding back here .
can we move them ?
yeah , with help . he &apos;s unconscious .
just let me stay with him .
please .
i can &apos;t find will . have you seen him ?
he might be down below .
we &apos;re gonna get you out of here .
he &apos;s my love of 66 years .
my story .
yeah . no , it &apos;s bad , but i &apos;m all right .
yeah , just don &apos;t come into the city .
and can you take jack on the bike ride today ?
right . and can you put him on ?
hey , buddy , listen , um , i gotta work ,
so beth &apos;s gonna take you on the bike ride , ok ?
all right , i &apos;ll see you later .
can you keep the media busy ?
is that all ?
for now .
you all right .
yeah . you ?
do me a favor . have that ear looked at .
if this one &apos;s parallel to some metro tunnel ,
there &apos;s a good chance it branches off .
all right , then we split up .
unless it &apos;s a trick .
well , then we &apos;re screwed .
is this the work of a terrorist cell ?
we do not believe that they are part of any terrorist cells .
the bank heists point to them being independent anarchists
with homicidal tendencies .
do you consider them serial killers ?
what was that ?
are they serial killers ?
yes . without a doubt , the suspects are serial killers .
as agent hotchner told you ,
they want you to admire them .
leaving the cameras on was their way to brag
about how much fear they were creating .
we need to know what happened , specifically the unsubs &apos; behavior
in the minutes leading up to the blast .
you &apos;ll be interviewing the survivors .
they &apos;ll be in various stages of shock ,
but any information you might get
could be the key to apprehending these suspects .
agent hotchner has compiled
a series of questions for you to ask them .
these questions are on your phones now .
thank you .
so happy you &apos;re all right .
what are you doing here ? it isn &apos;t safe .
i didn &apos;t want you to be alone .
i &apos;m not . you know , they separate the president
and the vice president at times like this .
what ... are you comparing us to potus ?
i &apos;m saying that you should be at quantico running point .
well , i &apos;m here right now .
what can i do ?
ok . i need to analyze every frame of this video .
morgan and jj said that the blast created a hole
between the underground vaults and these tunnels .
you know , most of these older banks
are made of granite or limestone for longevity .
so she knew to use a combination of c @-@ 4 and semtex
to open her escape route .
the tunnels let out at multiple points running west .
she could still be underground .
i know . this is what she does .
she probably waited till the last minute to exit .
she wants to see all this chaos .
we need to find the tunnel exit closest to the bank .
looks like it &apos;s two blocks here , just outside the perimeter .
what you got ?
will always say , if you can , you leave a bread crumb .
ok , so he was here ,
and clearheaded enough to leave us a clue .
they shot him , morgan .
why would they take him ?
jj , i don &apos;t know ,
but we didn &apos;t see any blood down there
and he &apos;s not here . both are good signs .
yeah , but they have him ,
god only knows where or why .
how &apos;s not good ?
what the hell is that ? you recording it ?
i &apos;m talking to you , izzy !
you planned this whole thing .
you didn &apos;t tell us any of it .
you set us up . you killed my brother .
no , that would be him .
how do i know he isn &apos;t your partner ?
why would i work with this guy ?
why would you do any of this ?
fbi said you got somebody else .
you sound jealous .
who is it ?
put that away .
this isn &apos;t about revenge , it &apos;s about survival .
if you haven &apos;t figured it out by now ,
i &apos;m your only way out of this mess .
all right .
let me kill him so we can get on with it .
we need him .
for what ?
leverage . we have to patch him up .
what , are you gonna walk him into an e.r. ?
jj and morgan said the unsubs
were in an alley northwest of the perimeter .
yeah , this footage confirms it .
ok , i can see two figures in the car .
please tell me one of them is will .
see how she &apos;s turned .
it &apos;s like she &apos;s keeping an eye on someone in the back .
does this mean will &apos;s in the car ?
there &apos;s somebody back there .
what &apos;s the license plate ?
that &apos;s weird . they &apos;re government tags .
federal or district ?
federal .
well , they &apos;re either stolen or forged .
who the hell are these people ?
they set up roadblocks in the district from 66 to dulles .
wait . so we &apos;re looking for
a black suv with its sirens on .
that &apos;s gonna stand out .
will &apos;s with them . i found his wallet .
it benefits them to keep will alive .
they must have a safe house set up .
whoever their outside man is , that &apos;s where they &apos;re heading now .
but where ? what &apos;s their end game ?
there &apos;s no logical reason . they want to create panic .
she &apos;s struck all over the world ,
which says she might not be american ,
but her ideology certainly speaks to washington .
whatever point she and her partner are making ,
it &apos;s important that d.c. &apos; s the setting .
the brothers were from philadelphia .
the other partner might be homegrown as well .
homeland &apos;s sending over a list of possibilities .
they &apos;re not on anyone &apos;s list .
then how do we find them ?
we find the common denominators
between all 14 robberies and we go from there .
so she &apos;s our only answer .
for now .
i &apos;ll call easter at interpol again .
now that there &apos;s been an explosion , he might have some ideas .
i &apos;m so sorry about what happened . is your team all right ?
no . one of our own was taken hostage during the escape .
they made it out of that ?
yeah . in a stolen government vehicle .
ah . we &apos;ve seen that before .
remember scotland yard &apos; 04 ?
a sedan was stolen from the impound lot .
yeah , uh , security footage verified it was a woman ,
even though she was never caught .
no , but they found the car .
she left behind some fake i.d.s and weapons ,
and that &apos;s where she got her moniker , lady x .
right . everybody figured with that arsenal and her ability to evade ,
she was trained , probably an assassin .
two days later an ambassador was killed .
shot in the stomach . the question is ,
what assassin doesn &apos;t go for the kill shot ?
this one . she &apos;s sadistic .
yeah . fits your profile , i take it .
well , yeah , it &apos;s gotta be the same woman .
she killed at each robbery .
the banks were simply a means to fund today &apos;s explosion .
hmm . even if she wears wigs ,
she doesn &apos;t mind showing her face ,
because she knows we won &apos;t find it .
we &apos;ve only got one other thing to go on-- what she left behind .
what about chad ? is there any connection ?
no , no , nothing yet .
but , um , if i had more help ,
say , running the london gateway office ,
you &apos;d have your answer much quicker .
yes , you should fix that .
well , i &apos;m trying .
you have always had bad timing .
oh , come on , emily .
don &apos;t you miss this ?
think about it .
yeah , i will .
all right . yeah , i got it .
that was the lab . semtex and c @-@ 4 like we thought .
red , blue , and yellow wires in each ,
old cell phone used as a detonator .
how old is the phone ?
10 year .
that &apos;s specific and rare .
ridiculously .
well , has anyone seen it before ?
it was last seen in a number of bombings in chad .
for a signature that specific ,
they must have been there to learn it .
did easter have any insight ?
a woman they called lady x
stole a sedan from scotland yard 8 years ago .
the investigation concluded
she was a trained assassin . she disappeared .
so lady x and queen of diamonds is the same person ?
it sounds like it .
garcia , look at assassination attempts
around the civil unrest in chad .
if she was a hired gun ,
she was likely taking orders from someone .
maybe she &apos;s still working for the same guy now
and he &apos;s still pulling the strings .
or maybe she &apos;s found her equal .
their obsession with killing and domination
has culminated in what we &apos;ve seen today .
getting off on the disaster they &apos;ve created .
classic symphorphiliacs .
then this isn &apos;t over .
far from it .
no . now that they &apos;ve gotten away with this ,
where are they gonna strike next ?
morning .
we need help . yeah ?
oh , is that a gunshot ?
he &apos;s gonna need fluids . there &apos;s a hospital 3 blocks from here .
there &apos;s no time .
fix him .
will &apos;s definitely with them , and it looks like
he can move without a problem .
cameras caught everything ?
yeah . the woman killed the medic .
hey , at least will &apos;s ok .
yeah , for now .
did they leave in the same vehicle ?
yeah , but it &apos;s been an hour since the explosion .
why haven &apos;t they left the city ?
the next attack could be here .
kevin , what have you got ?
just going through ...
they did that on purpose , right ?
and you saw everything until they had will .
well , they made a mistake .
leaving the cameras on
gave us much more information than they realized .
what time did the 911 text come in ?
9 : 23 .
the bank opened at 9 : 00 .
let &apos;s go back to the beginning . i need you both on this .
yes , sir .
he said he &apos;d call by now .
yeah . got it .
that was fast .
change in location .
get back on pennsylvania av .
i &apos;m not going anywhere till you tell me the plan .
what are you doing ?
he talks too much .
go ahead , officer , get him out .
and do what , just leave him here ?
yes , please .
sorry for the mess .
go ahead . drive .
the explosion was a distraction so they could escape . watch .
allow me to fast @-@ forward .
all right , here &apos;s where chris started shooting hostages .
the fella next to him didn &apos;t even flinch .
doesn &apos;t even break a sweat .
we know he &apos;s ex @-@ military , but still ...
his name is matthew downs .
that &apos;s what he told rossi and he wasn &apos;t lying .
history shows dishonorable discharge from usmc in &apos; 04 .
hi , will .
you see that ?
i want to do it again .
we will .
drive . you know the way .
drive .
ok , do me a favor .
keep going .
to where will walks in .
ok , now watch him .
and then ...
look at her .
her partner was in there the whole time ,
just not in the way that we thought .
they shot this whole thing like a home movie .
he could have been killed .
no , she wouldn &apos;t let that happen .
what the hell are they doing ?
it &apos;s all part of their plan .
they &apos;ve created scenarios
that are practically impossible to survive .
when they make it , it &apos;s the ultimate high .
like an adrenaline junkie .
nobody can find matthew downs .
ert said that he helped them , then he disappeared .
see you later ?
you better .
come on , officer .
he &apos;s a detective .
i &apos;m sorry , dick .
you better play nice , just like we talked about .
close the gate .
daddy .
hey , pal .
hey , will .
how are you ?
thanks for taking care of the little man .
let me put you down while i talk to miss kate .
ok , daddy .
you haven &apos;t been watching the news ?
i heard about what happened ,
but no , i didn &apos;t want the kids to see it .
you guys working the case ?
in shifts , yeah .
ok , well , if you need henry to stay , it &apos;s no problem .
well , uh--
i &apos;m izzy , will &apos;s cousin .
oh , hi . i &apos;m kate . nice to meet you .
she just--she just flew in .
she &apos;s gonna take care of him , so it &apos;s all good .
all right , well , if you need anything , let me know .
ok . sure thing .
hey , will . get some sleep .
you look like hell .
he &apos;s still in diapers ?
i don &apos;t really do those .
you touch my kid , i swear to god i &apos;ll kill you .
i already told you ,
you touch me ,
he kills her , then you .
do you really want to do that to your kid ,
be the reason he &apos;s an orphan ?
daddy , let &apos;s play .
daddy can &apos;t play right now .
i gotta go to work .
but this is , uh--
izzy .
izzy .
can you say hi to izzy ?
hi , izzy .
she &apos;s gonna stay with you till mama comes home , ok ?
ok .
i love you .
i love you .
come here .
it &apos;s gonna be ok .
it &apos;s gonna be ok .
all right . i love you .
go play back there .
of course will thought matthew was a hostage .
why wouldn &apos;t he ?
there &apos;s a good chance will tried to help him out .
he told him when to go for the doors
or offered to be a hostage to save the others .
i &apos;m sure he did .
well , there &apos;s a flip side to this .
this guy could have gotten into will &apos;s head .
is there anything you want to tell your family
in case you don &apos;t make it ?
you think will told them about jj and henry ?
unknowingly .
what &apos;s wrong ?
will &apos;s license is gone .
they know where we live .
hey , check it out , will . mine looks ...
it looks almost as good as yours , huh ?
i wasn &apos;t sure if i was gonna need you at all ,
but this way , it &apos;s more fun .
what do you want ?
well , it &apos;s simple .
you do everything i tell you
or izzy kills your boy .
there is no way out .
let &apos;s don &apos;t believe the hype you &apos;re the hero .
today &apos;s not the day for that , will .
come on , we &apos;re late .
don &apos;t do that .
what ?
go all quiet .
what am i supposed to do ?
yell .
i can &apos;t .
you can &apos;t blame yourself .
want to bet ?
i should have never left henry today .
you were doing your job .
i &apos;m a mom .
and a federal agent .
i &apos;m a mom first .
who had no possible way of knowing how this day would go .
we made this deal , will and i.
that henry would never be alone
without either of us .
i broke that .
he &apos;ll forgive you .
why are you doing this ?
why am i doing this ?
you ever been in combat ?
no .
but you think you know what happens to the souls of men ?
i never said that .
you have no idea .
soldiers don &apos;t come back and kill innocent people .
you were sick before you ever went to war .
you &apos;ve never been .
it wasn &apos;t the same after .
they just cut you off , you know ?
everyone . your family . the corps . the country .
goodbye .
we used you .
it &apos;s a betrayal .
so what did i do ?
i found a new home .
detective .
you on lockdown ?
no . we &apos;re diverting all traffic .
official vehicles only .
we &apos;re just here to do a sweep .
yes , sir . go on through .
i thirsty .
you need to draw it .
you &apos;re silly .
can we play hide @-@ and @-@ seek ?
in a minute .
come here .
my grandfather &apos;s name was henry .
he had blond hair just like you .
he was a scary man .
why ?
let me tell you a story .
so why didn &apos;t they take all the money ?
there were a man down and they had to get out in a hurry .
but for her , today was less about the money
and more about the spectacle .
everything they &apos;ve said and done was for a reason .
but what doesn &apos;t make any sense
is she switched the negotiation demand .
chris wanted to go to switzerland . she changed it to chad .
they also requested a private plane , but no mention of a pilot .
guys , if you think about it ,
even the dates mean something .
in 2004 , while she was wreaking havoc abroad ,
he was dishonorably discharged .
then in 2008 , they likely met in chad .
and now this in 2012 .
ok , so is it a coincidence that those are all election years
and they attacked d.c. ?
maybe this is a political statement .
no . it &apos;s more personal than that .
it &apos;s their story .
what ?
all of the details are a part of their story .
their timeline suggests
they were both destructive before they met .
so we &apos;re talking about ex @-@ military turning on their country .
it &apos;s rare , but soldiers become disenfranchised
no matter what the nationality .
and if he met someone like @-@ minded at that time ,
there &apos;d be no stopping them .
so you &apos;re thinking
they met during the civil unrest in chad in &apos; 08 .
yeah , and one or both of them are pilots .
so if garcia concentrates on that region ,
specifically weapons running in and out of libya ,
there &apos;s a good chance i &apos;ll find their paths crossed .
ok , multiple entries into libya
for a private pilot named matthew downs in &apos; 08,
but i don &apos;t have her name .
well , because she had aliases .
it &apos;s the only way to stay a ghost .
here &apos;s the thing-- they are a couple .
regardless of what we believe of them ,
they will celebrate themselves and their connection .
is there anything that happened on this date in chad ?
oh , you are good , emily prentiss .
but this news is not .
yes , there were multiple explosions on this date in &apos; 08 .
where were the most casualties ?
at a church-- no , no , a train .
semtex and c @-@ 4 ?
yep .
are trains still arriving at union station ?
yes , but only the authorities are allowed in .
that &apos;s why they needed will .
she doesn &apos;t have her cell .
kate would never take her eyes off henry like this .
they must have him .
wait .
we need a distraction .
i thought you cared more about your family , will .
he &apos;s gonna want to stay close to watch .
please proceed with caution to the nearest exit .
thank you .
please proceed with caution to the nearest exit .
thank you .
hotch , i got the suspect going out the east wing .
copy .
i found will .
is he mobile ?
negative . he &apos;s got 6 transmitters on him
and this whole place is gonna blow .
all right , where are you ? i &apos;m on my way .
no , you gotta get everyone out .
is the bomb squad here yet ?
they &apos;re 3 minutes away .
copy .
emily , you gotta get henry .
they &apos;re at the house .
turn around .
mommy !
henry !
mommy .
come here .
just get everybody out of here .
i &apos;m not gonna leave you . just give me a minute .
just about all you got .
ok , everything they did and said was about them .
narcissists .
romantics .
they met in 2008 .
what are you doing ?
seriously , emily , go .
go .
ok , hold on . chad .
2 @-@ 4 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 .
oh ! damn it .
ok , these are valentines for her ,
so a 4 @-@ letter word .
love , life , soul .
izzy .
her name is izzy .
i @-@ z @-@ z @-@ y .
oh , god !
prentiss , what &apos;s your status ?
prentiss , do you copy ?
the storytelling &apos;s in the details .
those wires mean something .
like what ?
the colors of the flag of chad .
red , yellow , and blue .
only one is different from the u.s. flag--yellow .
what do you think ?
how did you do that ?
i didn &apos;t overthink it .
they say i need another x @-@ ray .
hey , come on .
no tears . it &apos;s ok .
henry &apos;s safe . it &apos;s all gonna be fine .
ask me again .
what ?
ask me .
jennifer jareau , will you marry me ?
yeah .
it &apos;s about damn time .
there &apos;s a chaplain here . let &apos;s just do it now .
let &apos;s just get it over with .
hell , no . i &apos;m not the one that &apos;s supposed to be in the gown .
all right , fine . monday , then .
clear your calendar , &apos; cause we have a date at the courthouse .
the convention &apos;s still happening tomorrow if you want to go .
that whole city on the brink of destruction thing
kind of took the wind out of my sails , you know ?
that &apos;ll do it every time .
we didn &apos;t finish the inspection .
no need .
what happened ?
there is a horizontal crack in the foundation .
it just weakens the entire base that the house is sitting on .
yeah . that does not sound good .
so , our unsub is izzy rogers .
she &apos;ll be charged with multiple counts domestically ,
and our international counterparts will have their turn with her .
she will never see the light of day .
i just thought you &apos;d like to know that .
agent morgan , a word ?
i , uh ...
i haven &apos;t had a chance to speak with you .
i sort of hit the ground running .
it took a lot of courage to confront me
about my drinking .
you changed my life .
thank you .
honestly , ma &apos;am , that &apos;s not necessary .
a simple &quot; you &apos;re welcome &quot; would suffice .
i &apos;m just glad you &apos;re back .
no , you &apos;re not .
hang on , let me check .
oh , wait , she &apos;s here . erin , don &apos;t go anywhere .
dave wants to know if everyone is free tomorrow night ?
well , it depends on if he &apos;s buying . then i &apos;m definitely in .
yeah , me , too .
you hear that ? we &apos;re in .
emily , look , i know you don &apos;t want to talk about it ,
but it &apos;s exactly why we need to talk about it .
this has nothing to do with cracks in the foundation .
no . but it &apos;s a sign .
please don &apos;t get all free spirit on me .
i almost blew up yesterday , twice .
i know .
that &apos;s about as grounded as you can get .
you want to leave , don &apos;t you ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
it &apos;s the only reason you would be this quiet , emily .
can we please talk about this later ?
no .
how long have you been thinking about this ?
honestly ...
since i got back .
really ?
it &apos;s not you guys .
i love you .
i just can &apos;t grab on to my old life
and pretend that nothing happened .
is this about easter ?
no .
but he did ask me to run the london office .
and you &apos;re gonna do it .
he just asked yesterday .
but you &apos;re thinking about it .
i don &apos;t know yet .
i--
i thought buying a house and putting down roots
was gonna fix this feeling ,
it was gonna give me what i wanted .
but it hasn &apos;t .
it &apos;s bigger than that .
you think i should stay .
i think i miss you already .
what ?
i &apos;ll tell you later .
i do not like the sound of &quot; i &apos;ll tell you later . &quot;
it &apos;s jj &apos;s night , and i don &apos;t want to ...
all right , if you are telling me
that there is something bad happening right now
to balance out the goodness that is tonight ,
i will have none of it , because i don &apos;t believe in that .
although it &apos;s totally one of the truths of life , isn &apos;t it ?
the bitter and the sweet mixed up together in a cosmic soap
penelope , penelope , breathe .
that we &apos;ve all signed up for .
breathe .
i think kevin &apos;s here tonight .
it would make sense that he would come tonight--
he &apos;s here . he &apos;s here and he &apos;s with her ,
