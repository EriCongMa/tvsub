what on earth have you done ?
i was contacted at the office by a woman
who told me they were holding my father
and that he &apos;d be safe
as long as i did what they told me to .
you &apos;re selling your share
of the stowaway back to jack .
it &apos;ll work because he trusts me .
that &apos;s impossible . where did you get this ?
that &apos;s not important . the fact that i have it is .
so it has been you all this time .
now you &apos;re walking away ?
the other side possessed leverage which , shall we say ,
rendered the fight too costly .
hey . let &apos;s say somebody was able to remove
this leverage you &apos;re talking about .
we never had this conversation .
with this ring , you &apos;ll be in my life forever .
smile , mr. and mrs. porter .
jack ?
hey , jack . come in , it &apos;s dec.
sacrifice ...
by its strictest definition ...
takes something precious
in exchange for the appeasement of a higher power ...
an abiding devotion to a cause
that cannot be satisfied with a simple promise .
because an oath ...
no matter how solemn ...
asks nothing in return .
while true sacrifice ...
demands unspeakable loss .
well , mrs. porter ,
it has been a perfect day .
and night .
married eight hours ,
and already you &apos;re tired of kissing your wife ?
no , no , no , no , no . not at all . no . never .
i &apos;m just exhausted ...
and hot .
it &apos;s cooler under the stars .
should we take it back upstairs ?
let &apos;s go .
well , congratulations , victoria .
with one bullet , you &apos;ve slaughtered us all .
the bitch had it coming .
what are we gonna do with her ?
i--
oh , great .
it &apos;s her chauffeur .
apparently , he &apos;s growing impatient in our driveway .
turn that off . they can track it .
not yet .
unroll the carpet .
what on god &apos;s earth for ?
i have a plan . give me her phone .
oh , this unseasonal heat is absurd .
i take it that you disposed of your clothes last night ?
permanently .
good .
the staff will be here any minute .
you &apos;ve ordered the staff back ?
of course .
one night without the help is suspect enough .
besides , we have a labor day party to prepare .
this really is business as usual for you two , isn &apos;t it ?
precisely the point .
canceling at the last minute would draw unwanted attention .
and i &apos;m instating a moratorium
on this &quot; you two &quot; business , daniel .
it &apos;s time you stopped blaming us
and started shouldering some responsibility .
what , like you shouldered the responsibility
for bringing down that plane 20 years ago ?
oh , wait . you let david clarke do that for you .
so tell me ,
who &apos;s gonna be shouldering the responsibility
for the murder of helen crowley ?
oh , as fate would have it ,
a certain treacherous young bride
has made that a very simple choice for all of us .
amanda clarke ?
are you serious ?
she is charlotte &apos;s sister , for god sake .
what she is is a vicious opportunist
who has unleashed holy hell on this family
for a year and a half .
she could give a damn about charlotte .
only her twisted vendetta against us .
yeah , a vendetta that &apos;s completely justified .
perhaps .
but she &apos;s no innocent .
now amanda has threatened us with evidence
that would send us to our graves .
so if dispatching her to the initiative
is the only way to win this war ,
so be it .
now before she died ,
helen showed me a video feed of your office .
and we &apos;re going to use it to our advantage .
i &apos;ll meet you in my car in half an hour .
daniel ...
in my office , if you would , ms. davenport .
enlighten me , conrad .
what required my presence in this godforsaken house
at this godforsaken hour ?
well , i &apos;ve decided to change the date
of my gubernatorial announcement to , uh ... this evening .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
i assure you , i am not in a joking mood .
this is about amanda clarke , isn &apos;t it ?
i know she blackmailed you into giving up the stowaway .
i was standing right outside the door when she did it .
what does she have on you ?
well , instead of concerning yourself with the what ,
i suggest you focus on the who .
ms. clarke has in her possession the ability
to dismantle my entire campaign .
all the more reason to postpone the announcement .
oh , i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not an option .
therefore i strongly recommend
that you use everything in your sizeable bag of tricks
to prevent any further interference from amanda clarke .
welcome to my ultra @-@ private ,
completely untraceable mobile conference room .
or local tavern , in your case .
what are you doing at the stowaway ?
well , i told our favorite lovebirds
that i &apos;d watch the bar while they &apos;re away ... nesting .
what &apos;s your 20 , mr. bean ?
that &apos;s confidential .
you know the rules .
1,000 feet from the beach house at all times .
have to keep out of the way of prying grayson eyes .
well , daniel &apos;s eyes aren &apos;t prying so much as drifting
as of late .
look , forgive me .
but wasn &apos;t the whole purpose of snuggling back up with daniel
to get in with the initiative ?
yes , one of them , but--
well , then there &apos;s another angle we &apos;ve yet to explore .
padma .
uh , no . absolutely not .
i am not putting her in any more danger
than she &apos;s already in .
and i don &apos;t trust her .
see ? off @-@ limits .
why ? look , it &apos;s too late to save her from the initiative .
she &apos;s already in their grasp .
but if the story about her father &apos;s kidnapping is true ,
then we might actually be able to save him ... and her .
he is right , nolan .
if you really want to help padma and her father ,
no one &apos;s better equipped to do that than aiden .
i gotta go .
ashley .
what a surprise .
i know . it &apos;s been a long time .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
what are you doing here ?
sharing concern about a mutual friend .
i think amanda clarke might be in over her head
with the graysons .
she ruined an important deal i &apos;d been brokering
for the sale of the stowaway by blackmailing conrad .
amanda , blackmail ? i find that hard to believe .
and i would agree with you if i hadn &apos;t seen it for myself .
she stormed over unannounced
and showed conrad something on her laptop
that caused him to pull a complete 180
against his own interests .
what was on the computer ?
he didn &apos;t say .
but if amanda &apos;s planning a war against the graysons ,
then she &apos;s making a terrible mistake .
that sounds like a threat .
it &apos;s the truth .
those people are capable of more
than you and amanda could possibly imagine .
i &apos;ll talk to her .
good .
emily ...
thanks for the heads @-@ up , ashley .
damn it , amanda . what have you done ?
good morning , husband .
we overslept .
i miss our little alarm clock .
you want to radio home and check on carl
while i get us underway ?
yep .
then i &apos;m gonna cook you a big , greasy breakfast ,
captain porter .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re really married !
babe .
who &apos;s been smoking on the ...
hey , jack .
nice day for a sail , huh ?
well , i hate to interrupt the honeymoon ,
but this really couldn &apos;t wait .
okay . whatever it is , put the gun down ,
and let &apos;s talk .
sorry , j.p. , no can do .
you forced my hand when you got conrad
to back out of our deal .
he says you two idiots
have got some kind of leverage over him .
what leverage ?
a friend lent me the money to buy him out .
end of story .
not according to grayson .
sounds like somebody &apos;s getting played .
amanda ... get him on the phone .
i &apos;m sure we can sort this out .
okay , fine .
sit down . let &apos;s go . have a seat .
please tell me you don &apos;t know what he &apos;s talking about .
we do not want to mess with this guy .
he &apos;s seriously deranged .
he would have no problem hurting either one of us .
hurting us ?
jack , the guy snuck on our boat with a gun .
he &apos;s gonna kill us
unless we kill him first .
hey , hey , hey . enough chitchat .
i can &apos;t get a damn signal out here .
if you let me sail us closer to shore ,
you &apos;ll get a few bars .
okay . that &apos;s a good idea , gilligan .
no , no , no , no . you sit down . i got this .
you . you come with me .
come on .
let &apos;s go .
don &apos;t try to be a hero , okay ?
hey , charlotte . what are you up to ?
i am making a slide show for jack and amanda .
isn &apos;t she just the most gorgeous bride ?
she certainly wears my earrings better than i do .
but i was actually hoping to get them back .
um , you haven &apos;t seen them , have you ?
afraid not , but feel free to look for them .
just try to keep it down , &apos; cause carl &apos;s napping .
oh , sorry .
but not for long if that stupid
air conditioner seriously just broke again .
keep an eye on him for a sec while i look for declan ?
yeah , of course .
oh , my god .
nate ryan ?
this guy is bad news . what the hell is he doing ?
i don &apos;t know .
amanda stole my computer so that she could
threaten conrad into selling back the stowaway .
nate got nothing .
yeah , i &apos;ll tell you what nate &apos;s got--
a serious criminal record .
he &apos;s dangerous .
we need to contact them .
yeah , well , both their phones are off the grid .
declan says they haven &apos;t answered the radio
since they set sail .
i talked to the hotel in nantucket ,
and they said jack and amanda haven &apos;t checked in .
hey , what about jack and amanda ?
oh , i was ... just telling emily
that , uh , i talked to the hotel ,
and our newlyweds are firmly ensconced
in their honeymoon suite
with a &quot; do not disturb &quot; sign on the door .
that &apos;s a relief . thank you , nolan .
um , you don &apos;t know how to fix an air conditioner , do you ?
okay . i don &apos;t know why i ask you .
we need to find nate .
do you have his cell phone number ?
we can trace it .
i &apos;ll get it from jack &apos;s cloud .
okay , here we go .
tracking now .
nate &apos;s cell phone &apos;s out of range .
but the last time it sent a signal was ...
halfway to nantucket ?
we need a boat .
biscotti from stefania &apos;s .
best in the city .
oh , thanks . that &apos;s my favorite .
i should &apos;ve had you join me instead .
i was expecting helen crowley for a breakfast meeting
that she requested , but she never showed .
oh , would you like me to give her a try ?
yeah , just call and confirm that she &apos;ll be coming tonight
to the labor day party .
we can talk there .
ms. crowley is preoccupied
with a more pressing matter at the moment .
you &apos;ve spoken to her ?
oh , yes .
she came over to the house last night .
it seems someone tipped her off
to the evidence i &apos;ve been holding .
and let me guess .
forced you at gunpoint to hand it over ?
no , i gave it to her willingly to save you .
this story gets more and more ridiculous
every time you open your mouth .
you never had any evidence against helen crowley
because there never was any conspiracy against you .
you know damn well i was never in any danger .
you read the file that i gave you yesterday , daniel .
yeah , yeah , i did .
and everything in it &apos;s a big lie .
listen , all helen &apos;s company is guilty of
is nearly doubling the size of our fund .
and you knew that if you spoiled my relationship with them ,
dad could take back grayson global .
oh , you need to pull the wool from your eyes .
no , i need to pull you from my life .
grace , can you get security down here ?
conserve your security , daniel .
with friends like helen , you &apos;re going to need it .
i &apos;m looking for nolan ross .
yeah , if you find him , tell him he &apos;s fired .
padma just walked in .
it &apos;s for you .
padma , it &apos;s me .
thank god . where are you ?
i had an unrelated emergency that required my immediate attention .
the guy who handed you the phone--aiden mathis ?
he &apos;s a friend .
i remember him . he worked with daniel grayson .
how do you know we can trust him ?
because the same people who took your father
kidnapped his sister .
you &apos;re in good hands , i promise . i have to go .
this interruption had better be warranted .
well , you tell me , conny .
i &apos;m holding court with the porters as we speak .
your story and jack &apos;s aren &apos;t exactly matching up .
oh , well , that &apos;s because , as always ,
the wife is the source of the issue ,
leaving the husband blissfully ignorant of the mess
he &apos;ll have to answer for .
wait . are you telling me that amanda &apos;s the one
that &apos;s got your neck in a vice , not jack ?
what i &apos;m telling you is
that girl is in possession of a laptop that belongs to me .
now if you can return it intact ,
i &apos;ll see to it that your own ambitions are rewarded
far beyond your current ability to imagine .
uh , mr. ryan , i will need assurances that she has neither the intention
nor the ability to ever come after me again .
don &apos;t worry about it . she won &apos;t .
grayson told me about the computer that you swiped .
we can do this the easy way ,
or your new husband can catch a bullet .
do you understand me ?
fine . you win . it &apos;s yours .
good .
just promise me you won &apos;t hurt jack .
cross my heart , hope to die .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s in my backpack .
oh , yeah , go ahead .
no bullets .
you think i &apos;m stupid , huh ?
you don &apos;t think that i checked this boat before we shoved off ?
i took you at your word when you threatened to kill me
for putting jacky boy in the slammer .
i guess now ...
i can break that little promise i just made , huh ?
no , stop . leave jack out of this .
getting together with jack was just my excuse to stay in the hamptons
while i collected evidence to bring down the graysons .
what are you talking about ?
they murdered my father and got away with it scot @-@ free .
i &apos;m here for payback ,
something you and i both have in common .
come on . be smart about this .
you do this for grayson ,
his next move is to hang you out to dry .
please , please , please be here .
i &apos;ve got the proof . you &apos;ve got the muscle .
together we can bring these people to their knees .
squeeze them for every penny if that &apos;s what you want .
thank you , declan .
okay , fine .
but i want to see what &apos;s on that computer first ,
and then we &apos;ll talk .
it &apos;s not here . it &apos;s in montauk .
wait . wait . wait . hold everything . slow down .
what ?
declan &apos;s laptop just came on .
if i can hack his web cam ,
then maybe we can see what &apos;s going on .
look . it &apos;s jack . he &apos;s okay .
oh , thank god .
montauk , huh ?
you might as well make yourself comfortable .
i &apos;m turning this tub around .
no , wait . something &apos;s wrong .
they &apos;re on the move .
okay . time of death is 3 : 05 p. m .
don &apos;t be so hard on yourself .
that thing is practically as old as my--mother .
what are you doing here ?
charlotte . hello , declan .
hello .
i &apos;ve come to invite you to the house .
it &apos;s the end of summer , and it seems we &apos;ve barely seen you .
and tonight &apos;s our annual labor day party .
and things just would not be the same without you there .
oh , she needs me for another publicity stunt .
take him .
okay .
you &apos;ve wasted your time coming here .
dad only needs the grayson family by his side .
and i &apos;m a clarke now , something to be ashamed of .
now if you recall , after our last publicity stunt ,
i embraced your paternity .
and i can see that you &apos;ve inherited
far more than david &apos;s surname .
i &apos;m not ashamed of you , darling .
i &apos;m very proud of you .
well , i appreciate the sentiment .
but i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t fake any more grayson smiles .
oh , charlotte , please . if not for your father &apos;s benefit ,
do it for that overheated infant .
it &apos;s clear that he needs a quiet , temperature @-@ controlled space .
declan can attest to how difficult it is
to find a repairman on labor day .
yeah , she &apos;s right about that , and look , he needs rest ,
and so do you .
and i gotta get back downstairs .
fine , but only if declan can join us after he finishes his shift .
of course .
yeah , thank you .
i &apos;ll get carl &apos;s things .
the initiative draws you in with false hope .
by the time i got close enough , it was too late to save colleen .
i &apos;m so sorry .
look , i &apos;m not telling you this to scare you .
okay ? i &apos;ve been where you are . i know how you feel .
and i &apos;m confident that i can get you out of this
without endangering your father .
but first we need to be absolutely certain that he &apos;s still alive .
how do we do that ?
find helen crowley .
start with a simple phone call .
i want to talk to amanda .
let me give you some free marital advice , j. p.
she &apos;s only gonna tell you more lies ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s what wives do -- they screw you over .
i wasn &apos;t talking to you .
i heard everything you said .
is it true ? you were just using me the whole time ?
jack , i can explain everything--
by the book . you &apos;ve been had , man .
yeah , apparently , i &apos;m not the only one .
meaning what ?
she &apos;s been lying to you , too .
she brought a laptop on board last night .
jack , don &apos;t--
i saw it . it &apos;s gotta be down there somewhere .
is that true ?
no .
jack , i swear , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
for the first time since i met you ,
i know exactly what i &apos;m doing .
jack , please--
how could you do this to me , to our child ? you &apos;re unbelievable .
i &apos;m gonna let you two fight it out .
out of my way .
it better be down here , amanda .
be honest for once in your life .
is this marriage just a sham ?
no .
you &apos;re just using me to get even with the graysons ?
jack , when i first came to town ,
i didn &apos;t expect to get together with you , but i did .
then carl came along , and you were amazing and ...
i swear , i can explain everything .
about blackmailing conrad grayson ,
threatening to kill a man while i was in prison ?
what kind of person are you ?
what kind of mother are you ?
i did all of that for you ...
for us and carl .
look , jack . you &apos;ve given my life meaning .
i love you , jack . you have to believe that .
save the rest for divorce court .
mandy , get your ass down here .
you show me where that computer is now .
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go !
it &apos;s under the mattress .
come on !
it &apos;s in there .
get it .
camera &apos;s back online .
what &apos;s happening ?
what the hell is this ?
now !
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go .
jack ! oh , god .
oh , my god .
i think he shot jack .
come on , jack . we have to hurry .
what are you doing ?
saving you .
amanda ...
i love you , jack .
no . amanda . no !
where is he ?
no !
damn it !
victoria , may i say , you are positively radiant
in your natural element ?
you mean in the midst of a crisis or with blood on my hands ?
no , i mean , in that dress
at one of your wickedly extravagant soirees .
conrad , your gall never ceases to repulse me .
overt flattery aside ,
this extravagant soiree marks not only
the beginning of your farcical political career ...
but the end of summer ,
and therefore , our personal entanglement .
you and i had a deal .
oh , no , no , no , my pet .
you made a proclamation that i never agreed to .
and less you &apos;ve forgotten ,
we can &apos;t possibly disentangle from one another now .
because of last night ?
well , there is that .
and because voters worship family values ,
and without you at my side , my ambitions will fail .
you know full well i could give a whit
about your personal ambitions .
oh , you do . but you do give a whit about our son .
so let &apos;s press the flesh , shall we ?
any sign of jack ?
no . not yet .
keep looking . he &apos;s gotta be close .
wait . n @-@ nate &apos;s turning the boat around .
he &apos;s probably going back for jack . we have to get to him first .
let &apos;s keep this our little secret , shall we ?
my , uh , compliments on a lovely evening .
oh , all credit to my wife , mister ...
call me trask .
trask .
i was hoping to ask you a few questions if you don &apos;t mind .
as a matter of fact , we do .
this is a private function ,
and we specifically excluded the press .
i &apos;m not a reporter , mrs. grayson .
well , then ... how can we help you ?
you can start by telling me what happened to helen crowley .
after ms. crowley &apos;s driver dropped her at home ,
her phone was switched off , and we lost contact .
how vexing for you .
and you .
her driver confirmed that she was here before that ,
meeting with you , mrs. grayson .
that &apos;s right .
i proposed a trade-- the evidence i had been holding
in exchange for her assurance that my son would not be harmed .
helen crowley doesn &apos;t negotiate .
you know , i &apos;m wondering if her disappearance
is somehow related to the other thorn in our side .
uh , david clarke &apos;s daughter amanda .
she &apos;s our perpetual tormentor .
what leverage does she have ?
well , the copies of the federal evidence
your people failed to destroy in last spring &apos;s plane crash .
it seems our people failed
at any number of intentions that evening .
oh , wasn &apos;t i the lucky one ?
and how do you suppose a girl like that
came to possess such incendiary material ?
well , your former henchman gordon murphy .
he was married to her mother , after all .
anyway , vctoria made helen aware of the threat
as part of our detente ,
and helen assured her that amanda clarke
would pose no further problems .
and then ?
and then i told her to get the hell out of my house .
now , mr. trask ,
i would encourage you to follow that advice .
ems , i see him .
i see him .
he &apos;s not moving .
let &apos;s go .
tell me when !
almost ... got it .
i got it .
it &apos;s good .
okay . we gotta get him outta here .
jack ?
he &apos;s alive .
nolan , there &apos;s no exit wound .
you have to get him to a hospital .
nolan , i need to know that you can do this .
ems , it &apos;s jack .
i will do everything that i can ,
but what are you gonna do ?
i can &apos;t leave amanda .
ems !
just go !
nolan , go .
come on . come on .
bitch .
hang in there , buddy .
hang in .
last message received today
8 : 47 p.m.
helen , it &apos;s padma .
i &apos;ve located carrion , but the program is incomplete .
nolan &apos;s the only one who can complete it ,
and i &apos;m the only one who can convince him to .
but i won &apos;t until you send me proof
that my father is still alive .
helen &apos;s been compromised .
i &apos;m gonna need to arrange delivery .
amanda .
amanda .
emily .
you so much as blink , and you &apos;re dead .
we have to get jack .
he &apos;s safe . just get on the boat .
emily !
amanda , find his gun !
who the hell are you ?
you &apos;ll never know .
bye @-@ bye now .
we need to turn off the gas .
we gotta get outta here now !
hold on a second . my necklace .
amanda , no !
come on .
no !
emily , get down !
amanda !
amanda !
amanda , can you hear me ? !
emily .
amanda !
okay ?
are you ready ?
helen ?
helen &apos;s no longer with us ,
but your orders remain .
deliver the program in its finished form ,
or your father dies .
before i do anything else ,
i need proof that you haven &apos;t killed him already .
i believe you just signed for it .
feel free to check the fingerprint .
no .
ladies and gentlemen , it is my honor
to introduce conrad grayson
and his family .
thank you .
and it is our pleasure to stand here
with our closest friends and supporters
on this labor day .
with the blessings and support of my wife and children ,
i have decided to announce
that i will humbly be seeking the opportunity
to serve as your next governor .
thank you .
tell me jack &apos;s gonna be okay .
we &apos;ll know as soon as nolan comes back with the boat .
just try to be still . save your energy .
damn it .
jack ...
and my baby ...
i need to know that you &apos;ll take care of them .
don &apos;t you talk like that .
oh , god .
give me your word .
i promise .
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t be .
you &apos;ve given me the one thing that i thought i &apos;d never have ...
a real family .
here .
i &apos;ll be back for this .
and i &apos;ll be back for you , too .
i promise .
amanda , wait .
we &apos;re sisters , right ?
right .
i love you .
i love you , too .
oh , god , no .
amanda .
oh , god .
no , no , no , no , no .
no .
oh , god .
it &apos;s finally cooling off .
mercifully .
i look forward to the change of season .
sweetheart , are you all right ?
what kind of question is that ?
of course he is .
we all are , my dear , thanks to you .
how are we gonna live with this ?
like we always do .
we go about our lives as if nothing ever happened .
and what about amanda clarke ?
poor girl .
she chose the wrong enemy .
sacrifice demands the surrender of things
we cherish above all else .
only out of the agony of those losses
can a new resolution be born ...
an undying devotion to a cause greater than one &apos;s self ...
emily !
emily !
and a moral duty to see a journey through ...
to its absolute completion .
