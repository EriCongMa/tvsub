gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
georgina ? where are you ?
you can tell jesus that the bitch is back .
emma .
got a credit card fake i.d.
and i want bacardi and a boy .
that beautiful dinner you made--
you were gonna propose weren &apos;t you ?
i just don &apos;t know where we stand right now .
tell me if what you feel for me is real .
it &apos;s just a game .
chuck why did you just do that ?
because i love her .
i can &apos;t believe blair won !
yeah , who even voted for her ?
me. about 150 times .
that was really sweet .
i just wanted to make sure she had the perfect night .
where &apos;s the prom king ?
we broke up .
but everything was so perfect .
turns out fairy tales end when they do for a reason .
like everything on the upper east side
high school graduation is done a little differently .
who needs pomp and circumstance when you have paparazzi ?
ever since &quot; gossip girl &quot; broke my arrest
it has been everywhere .
do you know eric found it in &quot; pravda &quot; ?
you &apos;re famous because you got arrested .
of course this happened to you .
i just can &apos;t wait for this day to be over .
the end of high school means the end of me on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
no , she has plagued you more than anyone .
you were her first blast ninth grade , if i remember correctly .
it involved a white dress some rain
and a recently docked aircraft carrier ?
okay , let &apos;s just hope that my mug shot is
the last thing she ever prints about me .
look on the bright side .
gossip girl does not report on college
so this is your last day to be under her rule .
okay can you just take my mind off of me ?
talk about anything .
did he say it like ...
anything but-- &quot; i love her &quot; ?
&quot; i love her &quot; ?
&quot; i love her ? &quot;
i totally set myself up for that one .
b.i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re acting like this is new information .
you know how chuck feels about you .
the problem isn &apos;t his feelings .
it &apos;s his inability to express them to the right person .
who cares who he tells if he doesn &apos;t tell me ?
does he even know that you and nate broke up ?
have you not told him ?
it &apos;s not like we stay up at night
braiding each other &apos;s hair and having heart @-@ to @-@ hearts .
then why are we still here ? we &apos;ve already paid the check .
serena .
so we &apos;ll meet afterwards for the party .
will do .
good luck up there , son. i &apos;m proud of you .
thanks .
it &apos;s like getting a smile from the president .
and how are you ?
i &apos;m good. and you ?
good , good. i start my internship
at the mayor &apos;s office next week.so that &apos;s the big news .
as for today i got my mom and my grandpa
to agree to sit together so that &apos;s something .
and things with you and
blair ?
yeah , it &apos;s over. but it &apos;s okay .
it turns out , we just had to go through something to be sure .
ever since it ended i can &apos;t stop thinking
about how horribly i handled everything between us .
so i just wanted to say i &apos;m sorry .
thanks .
it means a lot. and thanks for what you did last year .
if i hadn &apos;t taken the s.a.t.s i &apos;d never be going to n.y.u.
right after i get back from my
backpacking trip through europe , of course .
look at us--so civilized .
hey stop by my party tonight .
party ? what party ?
after @-@ grad party .
i figured i &apos;d at least do something
to commemorate my time here. so i hope to see you there .
both of you .
is that a program ?
yeah. and smile .
today &apos;s the first day of the rest of your life .
way ahead of you .
this graduation is a celebration for us too .
no more mean girls .
we have suffered under their dictatorship for way too long .
starting next fall , there &apos;ll be peace in the kingdom .
j. wanna throw your hat in the ring ?
what are you talking about ?
queen. what else is there to talk about ?
the fact that there &apos;s not gonna be a queen next year ?
what would high school be without hierarchy ?
bearable ? a nice place to spend time ?
ladies .
i thought we were matching our headbands under our caps .
what &apos;s going on ?
your minions were just telling me
about the search for the next queen .
they don &apos;t get to choose the next queen. i do .
and take off that hideous scarf , penelope .
you can see if from space .
not so fast j. don &apos;t waste your time appealing to blair .
we don &apos;t listen to her anymore .
the coronation happens at midnight at nate archibald &apos;s party .
whoever brings us the biggest piece of untold
constance gossip wins and you &apos;ve got competition .
the new girl emma boardman transferring in next year .
nice to meet you little j .
see you at midnight ? unless you want to concede right now ...
oh and next year
you don &apos;t want to take the subway to school .
you &apos;re more than welcome to sleep at my house. it &apos;s on park .
well so much for that .
at least we have all summer to prepare for hell .
no. the cycle of abuse must be broken .
the monarchy ends tonight .
hey. why are you sitting here all alone ?
i &apos;m waiting to approve a special insert
for the program . it turns out ...
my name was left off the list of graduates .
fate sure knows how to run with a bit .
well at least you &apos;re special .
mr. humphrey ?
oh thank you .
&quot; we apologize for the inadvertent omission
&quot; of daniel humphrey from the graduation program .
he is indeed graduating . congratulations don . &quot;
that &apos;s perfect .
i haven &apos;t seen you around .
have you been looking ?
how are you ?
i &apos;m fine .
no i &apos;m great .
um but i could be better .
i ... was wondering if you heard that i ...
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m so happy high school &apos;s over .
congratulations .
you too .
everyone let &apos;s line up
so we can make our way down please .
girls on on side boys on the other
girls on on side boys on the other
right . well good luck up there .
how could i have forgotten ?
we reserved our seats together .
oh lily and rufus !
oh we haven &apos;t seen you
since we broke matzo together .
hi .
you look wonderful .
thank you .
love--it &apos;s put color in all of our cheeks .
we were talking on the way over here
about what a wonderful couple you two make .
so we decided you should take the plunge like us .
dating at our age is not enough .
marry before it &apos;s too late .
well it &apos;s not exactly
uh we &apos;re just enjoying the journey .
well apparently at one point
we had a destination
but that no longer seems to be the case .
subtle .
mm i was going for honest .
dear friends colleagues
as we stand here today
we bear witness to a bright new beginning .
just standing in front of him
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t do it .
i can &apos;t believe i chickened out .
it &apos;s okay b.
this is the beginning of something new .
now we can all move on .
the possibilities are endless after all .
yes . to great things .
and so what if i &apos;m not going to yale ?
you were recently incarcerated
and i &apos;m afraid to talk to chuck
because he might hurt me again .
this is our moment .
nobody can take that from us .
i urge you to go out into the world
and show them who you have become .
not so fast .
you &apos;re not graduating until i give you my diplomas .
mine are labels and labels stick .
nate archibald-- class whore .
dan humphrey-- the ultimate insider .
chuck bass--coward .
blair waldorf--weakling .
and as for serena van der woodsen
after today you are officially irrelevant .
o.m.g.
i know .
congratulations everyone . you deserve it .
now please join me in welcoming the class of 2009 .
class please stand .
you were right b.
nobody can take this day away from us .
gossip girl is going down .
gossip girl has ruined our graduation
and it &apos;s only 2 : 00 .
we have to stop her .
i don &apos;t know . messing with gossip girl ?
think of the consequences .
you can &apos;t ask us to jeopardize our futures
for your personal vendetta .
besides she didn &apos;t even say anything about us
not even penelope .
oh soup dumplings .
this is not my personal vendetta .
she attacked all of us and was wrong .
completely .
totally .
well i &apos;m gonna go do some damage control just in case
so don &apos;t wait for me .
well what about you two ?
well of everyone here
you guys probably have the most secrets you &apos;re hiding .
i &apos;ll gather intel .
i &apos;ll run some stats .
i &apos;m sorry ...
about before .
about what part exactly ?
the pre @-@ graduation squabble
or the fact that you no longer want to marry me ?
what exactly is our problem anyway ?
you tried to give me money behind my back
when i said no .
we both make mistakes .
but if we can &apos;t accept that about each other
how do we move forward ?
i don &apos;t know .
but we can &apos;t go back .
i need to um see my guests .
can we talk ?
always . is something wrong ?
i know you have high aspirations for me
so in the spirit of full disclosure
there &apos;s something you need to know
something that may ... it may come out .
i &apos;m intrigued .
last summer ... i had an affair
with an older woman .
oh my boy . welcome to washington .
she was married at the time .
go on .
and she ...
well she paid me .
well ...
whatever happens i &apos;ll protect you .
let &apos;s hope it doesn &apos;t come out .
yeah .
have you seen your girlfriend ?
you don &apos;t know ?
what ?
blair and i broke up .
this party is not so hot .
there &apos;s a killer doughnut place around the corner .
can you guys believe gossip girl ?
&quot; the--the insider &quot; ? what is that ?
a really good movie ?
that &apos;s a tabloid tv show .
come on. seriously , guys. she can &apos;t keep getting away with this .
we all just have to band together and take her down .
serena we just graduated. gossip girl high school
all these people backbiting and conniving--
don &apos;t you think we should be moving on with our lives ?
well high school &apos;s over
but--but they &apos;re still my friends. you &apos;re still my friend .
yeah .
what you--you don &apos;t think so ?
no no i do but honestly ...
school &apos;s finished
and our parents ...
that--that doesn &apos;t really look great .
next year we &apos;re gonna be in different cities .
and when you think about it
what &apos;s really keeping us together ?
so that &apos;s it ?
you--you get your diploma and you &apos;re just moving on ?
well congratulations dan .
have--have a good life .
so ... doughnuts ?
no let &apos;s just go home .
i want to--i want to get out of this suit .
all right .
the number of posts in the last six months about constance
and st. jude &apos;s is more than double
of the next mentioned school .
number one on our hit list
would seem to indicate a personal connection .
and i refuse to believe the students at our school are
any worse than those at horace mann or spence .
so gossip girl most likely goes to or went to constance .
yeah exactly. why else the focus ?
well , i would also assume that she is our age .
the blasts all started when we were in the ninth grade .
an upperclassman simply wouldn &apos;t care .
so you &apos;re saying gossip girl &apos;s a senior , like us ?
well , if she &apos;s a senior
then--then that means she &apos;s in the room right now .
so who could it be ?
rebecca sherman ? no her head &apos;s always in a book .
she &apos;s not paying enough attention .
okay .
not her either .
then i submit nelly yuki .
low profile
good with computers ...
many grudges mostly against me .
no i have been with her way too many times
when gossip girl has sent out a blast .
there &apos;s no way it &apos;s her. i &apos;m gonna speed this up .
what are you doing ?
sending a tip to gossip girl .
chuck , get the room quiet for me .
i &apos;m way ahead of you .
if i could have everyone &apos;s attention please .
we &apos;d like to thank you all for being here today .
jonathan ? what ?
gossip girl is ... a guy ?
it &apos;s him. look .
what just happened ? what &apos;s going on ?
tell &apos; em who you are .
wait. so if you &apos;re not gossip girl
you must know who she is .
no. i just hacked into her server over spring break .
i was bored .
and now we have access to every e @-@ mail that gets sent to her .
i can &apos;t believe she gets
all these posts that she doesn &apos;t report .
no. no. boring .
apparently you dye your hair .
yeah we have this theory
that either she can &apos;t substantiate some of them ...
or she waits till the perfect moment for maximum damage .
i wish i could be more helpful .
no you--you have been so helpful .
can i actually borrow you for a minute ?
i &apos;d like you to help me dig deeper .
nothing in here &apos;s good enough to beat the new girl ...
except for this .
no way. would you really use that ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t think i can .
if you did you &apos;d totally win .
yeah , and then i could abolish the monarchy forever .
you going to nate &apos;s party ?
no. i thought vanessa and i would hit a movie instead .
and here we go. all right
it &apos;s your last party of high school .
now i know you don &apos;t love your classmates
but you just shared four years with them. honor that .
and i suspect there may be a couple of people
that you &apos;d like to stay friends with , or at least one person .
yeah. yeah serena said kinda the same thing .
so h @-@ how am i gonna get these doses of sage wisdom
when i &apos;m living at the dorms at n.y.u. ?
i &apos;ll appear to you like obi @-@ wan .
now go young jedi .
all right. bye. have fun .
our kids graduated high school today .
and i felt ... old .
and so i wanted to do something young and crazy
and you &apos;re the only one i wanted to do it with .
what &apos;s in the bag ?
something i found in chuck &apos;s room .
well then i bet it &apos;s good .
are you dressing for someone ?
yes .
someone i hope is finally ready to love me
the way cyrus loves you .
cyrus told me .
you told chuck how you felt and ...
he ran away .
you seeing him tonight ?
yes .
don &apos;t let him get away again
oh .. hey .. drunky .
don &apos;t embarrass yourself .
dan . you &apos;re here .
there &apos;s something i have to tell you
and it &apos;s only because i &apos;m drunk
and i &apos;ll probably never see you again .
i um ....
oh god . i have to go .
was she just about to tell me she loved me ?
i &apos;m so glad we came .
blair , i need to talk to you . gossip girl knows .
ominous.but ill @-@ timed .
you can tell me tomorrow or never .
about new year &apos;s ?
look , the mean girls want the best piece of gossip
in exchange for keys to the kingdom .
i just thought you &apos;d want to know .
if gossip girl were gonna post that information
she would have done it this morning .
and like i said , the mean girls don &apos;t control anything .
blair , wake up .
you &apos;re not queen anymore . you haven &apos;t been for a while .
and you &apos;re not going to be either
if you tell anyone what you know .
i &apos;m sorry i wasted my time on you .
you don &apos;t have what it takes .
you never did . now if you &apos;ll excuse me .
bring me your leader .
it &apos;s not midnight .
my gossip &apos;s too juicy to wait .
i wanna talk .
i prefer to talk after .
what do you think about my coat ?
i like it . why ?
and now ?
even better .
and ... what about my headband ?
i ... admire it .
and ... my stockings ?
oh i adore them .
and my dress ?
i worship it .
how do you feel about me ?
say it .
i ...
what is it now ?
oh not again .
serena van der woodsen
just couldn &apos;t leave well enough alone .
since she had to find out the truth about me
i &apos;m going to tell you the truth about everyone .
every gossip bomb i &apos;ve got is about to drop
and if you &apos;ve got a problem with that , take it up with her .
ever wonder why miss carr left town ?
a little bee told me dan humphrey had sex with her
during the school play .
remember the sparks between humphrey &apos;s sis and nate ?
oh my god .
during a hot photo session .
thank god it stopped at pg @-@ 13
or someone could have ended up in jail like her brother .
is that true ?
what ? you were in jail ?
and as for blair waldorf say &quot; uncle . &quot;
we hear she kept it in the bass family on new year &apos;s .
but rumor has it chuck spent some time in brooklyn--
metaphorically speaking of course .
you slept with jack ?
you slept with vanessa ?
serena van der woodsen here &apos;s looking at you .
jack ? blair ? really ? that &apos;s calculating.even for you .
i was sad and he tried to comfort me .
you call that comfort ? more like collusion .
like you didn &apos;t do that with the dregs of d.u.m.b.o.
i &apos;m standing right here .
i can &apos;t believe you slept with miss carr .
and you were in jail ?
i can &apos;t believe you let some guy take photos of you .
wh @-@ what was he doing there ?
no , no , no . it wasn &apos;t as bad as it sounds . okay ?
you guys just stop it , okay ? she &apos;s trying to create
a divide between us . this is exactly what she wants .
we can &apos;t let that happen .
you want to know something ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s her that created the divide .
i think it was you .
you &apos;re the reason we &apos;re on &quot; gossip girl &quot; in the first place .
if it wasn &apos;t for you we &apos;d all be safe .
okay that &apos;s enough . we all did what she said we did .
you can &apos;t blame serena for this .
yes we can .
she declared war on gossip girl.you brought this on us .
that &apos;s , that &apos;s not fair .
serena was just trying to help everybody .
what do you know about anything
besides your label was the only one that was true .
you mean what she said about the &quot; insider &quot; ? are you crazy ?
you &apos;re friend with nate archibald
you played on the soccer team.you got into yale
you got the lead role in the school play
you got published in &quot; the new yorker &quot;
you had sex with a teacher .
plus you dated the most popular girl in school
and ignored the rest of us .
no . i meant them .
you pretend not to be like us but you are ... to the bone .
and you should have known better .
thank you .
kudos s. way to go out with a bang .
now what did you want to tell me before ?
oh . it doesn &apos;t matter now .
it just happened .
leave me alone .
you &apos;re not mad at me because of that .
just like i &apos;m not mad at you about vanessa .
stop telling me what i feel .
we &apos;re just doing what we always do--finding excuses .
well ... i won &apos;t do it anymore .
i know you told serena you love me .
serena heard wrong .
last year you told nate . this year you told serena .
you tell everyone but me . why can &apos;t you tell me ?
is gossip girl right about you being a coward ?
that &apos;s not true and you know it .
gossip girl can be right about you all she wants
but i won &apos;t let her be right about me .
i will not be weak anymore .
you can &apos;t run .
you have to stay here and hear it this time .
chuck bass ...
i love you .
i love you so much ...
it consumes me .
i love you ...
and i know you love me too .
tell me you love me
then everything we &apos;ve done--
all the gossip and the lies
and the hurt
will have been for something .
tell me it was for something .
maybe it was .
but it &apos;s not anymore .
oh my gosh . do you remember the casbah ?
that concert ?
barely ...
in the best way .
oh my god . you covered &quot; how will i know &quot;
and you dedicated it to me
and i sat there trying not to laugh . oh god .
i was so in love with you .
what are we doing ?
things were so much easier when we were younger .
unlike our kids we just jumped into things .
i mean , why can &apos;t we just be more like that
just figure it out as we go along ?
maybe this didn &apos;t turn out to be
the romance we thought it would be when we first met .
well . it &apos;s more like choose your own adventure .
maybe it just wasn &apos;t the right time . maybe it never will be .
what if it is ?
what if we &apos;re just too stubborn to see it ?
i don &apos;t want to miss out .
well ... neither do i.
i don &apos;t have a ring
so this will have to do .
rufus . what are you doing ?
marry me , lily .
marry me .
i know that &apos;ll make me your ... uh your fifth husband .
so ?
yes .
give me your hand .
come here .
hey . don &apos;t worry about this .
okay ? everyone &apos;s gonna get over it eventually .
when ?
nate , high school is over . if i don &apos;t fix this tonight
some of these people will never talk to me again .
and--and what happens next year ?
what ... she does this to the next
serena and nate and dan and blair ?
well . what else can you do ?
it is too easy for her to sit behind a computer
and not face the damage she &apos;s done .
wait . that &apos;s not true is it ?
no .
but she doesn &apos;t know that .
you didn &apos;t get to use your gossip .
well here &apos;s something new--
i told chuck i loved him ... again
and he didn &apos;t say it back ... again .
blair . i &apos;m not gonna tell people that .
why not ? i &apos;m giving you what you need to be queen .
i don &apos;t want to be queen .
i just wanted a chance to have a life in school
and look what it almost made me do .
that &apos;s the thing ....
you need to be cold to be queen .
anne boleyn thought only with her heart
and she got her head chopped off
so her daughter elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man .
she married her country .
forget boys .
keep your eye on the prize jenny humphrey .
you can &apos;t make people love you
but you can make them fear you .
for what it &apos;s worth
you &apos;re my queen .
i choose you .
thank you .
it &apos;s already been over an hour .
the bar &apos;s closing soon .
she &apos;s gonna come . i know she is .
whoa whoa whoa . wait . wait .
dan is gossip girl ?
gossip girl ? you crazy ?
then what are you doing here ?
i loopt you . are you waiting for gossip girl ?
yeah .
and i know you don &apos;t approve .
i &apos;m gonna go close the tab .
this grudge match thing--
it d--it doesn &apos;t seem like you .
what &apos;s--what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t want to be irrelevant .
irrelevant ? you &apos;re serena van der woodsen .
gossip girl might be right about me
but she &apos;s--she &apos;s wrong about you .
without serena van der woodsen
who would i have dreamt about ?
i might have spent my whole life on the outside
if you hadn &apos;t let me in ...
which i &apos;m holding against you .
thank you .
thank you .
oh , my god .
oh , that makes sense .
wait. they &apos;re a team .
team of what ?
wait . why are you all here ?
i got a text saying to meet you .
yeah
so did i.
so did i.
you wanted to meet gossip girl .
well look around . you just did .
i &apos;m nothing without you .
and while most high school friendships fade
it &apos;s my hope that what happened today will bond you forever .
now that all my secrets are out
you have a clean slate ...
until college .
congratulations .
i &apos;m coming with you. oh .
drinks on me .
yes .
yes. thank you .
i &apos;m sorry about what i said .
you don &apos;t have to apologize .
where &apos;s chuck ?
it &apos;s over ...
once and for all .
but i &apos;m gonna be strong .
still , it doesn &apos;t feel right without him here .
you know everyone else is here .
yeah ...
everyone &apos;s here .
oh it &apos;s beaufiful
it looks so good on you .
oh ! i &apos;ve dreamed about this for so long .
do you want to fire it up ?
i can &apos;t. blair and i have a meeting at rouge tomate .
huh. that &apos;s cryptic .
both .
so how are you today ?
miserable .
but at least college
will be the fresh start it &apos;s supposed to be .
no chuck no nate .
no anybody really .
except gossip girl .
forget i said that .
it &apos;s okay . i read them too .
&quot; spotted--chuck bass in france. chuck bass in germany .
chuck bass in italy . &quot;
i hope he has so much fun that they have to quarantine him .
open your present .
what ?
oh ! it &apos;s to remind you of who you are .
i love it . i am gonna put it up on my wall at brown
as soon as i get back from europe. oh !
come with me .
i chased a guy for years who wasn &apos;t that into me
and going to a glorified state school .
my mother married an entertainment lawyer .
so i need to just stop moving
and contemplate the failure of my life .
well when you &apos;re ready to start moving again
you know i &apos;ll be here .
yes of course i do .
humphrey where &apos;s your mind ?
i know it sounds crazy
but i actually-- i kind of miss high school .
i miss blair waldorf and her daily ego demolitions
nelly yuki stealing my lunch
even chuck bass who would get so close to talk .
wow. you miss chuck bass .
well not as much as you probably miss chuck bass .
but yeah i uh i think it &apos;s safe to say
that the nostalgia &apos;s officially begun .
apparently the upper east side feels the same way about you .
what &apos;s up dan vanessa ?
shouldn &apos;t you be getting the deputy mayorher coffee or something ?
well i think she &apos;d rather i gave her something else .
yeah she made a pass at me .
god. is she hot ?
actually yeah she is .
you &apos;re both disgusting .
i don &apos;t want to be the guy gossip girl made me out to be .
so what are you gonna do ?
go backpacking ... if you &apos;ll have me .
well , it &apos;s too late. i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m taking someone else .
oh , really ? who ?
it &apos;s me .
him .
yeah , we &apos;re gonna have a great time . melissa and i .
oh. really ?
daniela .
close .
it &apos;s vanessa but thanks for trying .
please let me go with you .
i &apos;m always doing what everyone else wants me to do .
i want to do something for me .
and we &apos;ll just go as friends .
don &apos;t worry. it won &apos;t be anything romantic unless
you know we drink a little too much in vienna one night .
how could you say no to that ?
seriously .
as long as you take off that ridiculous tie
so i can maybe try to picture you with a backpack .
what &apos;s wrong with my tie ?
mm. i need a coffee .
he &apos;s always wearing a tie .
so i &apos;m the one who does the good deed
and that guy goes off with the girl ?
it &apos;s good to be that guy .
do you ... you go here to n.y.u. ?
