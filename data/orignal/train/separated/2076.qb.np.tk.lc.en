come on . it &apos;s right over here .
that wasn &apos;t good .
yeah . we should get out of here .
i think we came this way .
look-- a tent .
hello ? anybody there ?
no , we can &apos;t go in there .
you kidding ? we got to get out of this rain .
outstanding group .
thank you , sir .
good to know your father &apos;s rifle still shoots tight .
yeah . he taught me how to break it down
before i was allowed to fire around .
he told me about this place .
your father wanted to bring you here .
he promised me a hunting rifle for my 16th birthday .
then things changed .
you don &apos;t you put a couple of rounds through it ?
let me see if i can put some lead through that target .
well , boy , that &apos;s 700 yards--
a hell of a long shot for an old man like you .
i got 20 bucks says you don &apos;t even hit steel .
how do you like that ?
well , let &apos;s make it two rounds .
double or nothing .
you got it .
ready .
i have the target .
nice shooting , joe .
must be the rifle .
must be .
i &apos;ll tell you what-- you buy me one of those umbrella drinks ,
we &apos;ll call it even .
okay .
so , uh ...
when you are you going back to coronado ?
i &apos;m not .
i put in for a transfer to pearl harbor .
overseeing seal team training .
really ?
the island seemed like a ...
pretty good place to wind it down .
the thing is , joe , i mean , you &apos;re not the ...
you &apos;re not really a fun @-@ in @-@ the @-@ sun ,
hang @-@ loose , aloha type .
they let you stay .
yeah , they did .
what &apos;s hawaiian for &quot; bottoms up &quot; ?
here &apos;s to hanging loose .
i &apos;ll believe that when i see it .
hey , you know what ?
it &apos;s going to be good to have you around .
joe white .
when ?
i &apos;m on my way .
everything all right ?
no .
the deceased &apos;s name is clay garcia .
that &apos;s his wife , marissa .
cause of death ?
technically speaking , it &apos;s not my case .
that &apos;s not an answer , max .
the body was recovered in the jungle .
the cause of death was a self @-@ inflicted gunshot wound
with a gun registered to him .
one of the reasons i came back to this island
was to be around guys like garcia .
you trained him , didn &apos;t you ?
one of the best seals i &apos;d ever seen .
we were supposed to go spearfishing next week .
why would he kill himself ?
deployments took a toll on his marriage .
he went on leave from active duty
hoping to reconcile .
hell , he was going to fight to save his marriage ,
not shoot himself up in the jungle .
joe , i &apos;ve seen guys kill themselves
&apos;cause they can &apos;t make a mortgage payment .
yeah , but garcia was not that guy .
he was squared away .
no matter how hard
or impossible the assignment , garcia took it .
something &apos;s not right .
he didn &apos;t kill himself .
you want me to look into this ?
you tell me it &apos;s a suicide , i &apos;ll believe it .
all right .
max , did you take a look ?
oh , i shouldn &apos;t even be doing this .
well , i familiarized myself with the m.e. &apos; s case summary
and took a cursory look at the crime scene photos .
okay , i need you to take a closer look , max , okay ?
you want me to reopen the case ?
yeah . what &apos;s the big deal ?
do you have any extenuating evidence
that might suggest that this wasn &apos;t a suicide ?
no .
okay , well , then ,
i &apos;m going to need a little bit more than that
in order to officially reopen the case ,
considering that my boss , the senior medical examiner ,
was the one who performed the autopsy .
there is an unwritten rule
that you don &apos;t mess with the boss &apos;s toe tags .
well , maybe he made a mistake , max .
highly unlikely .
he graduated summa cum laude from harvard medical school .
besides , the weapon found
in the deceased &apos;s hand was registered to him .
so , unless there is new evidence or a ...
a compelling theory of a crime being committed ...
max , max ,
listen to me .
my former co lost one of his men .
i want you to reopen this case .
is this a favor or an order ?
it &apos;s both .
so , what , are you hanging with ray mapes now ?
well , hello to you , too , cuz .
you do know that hpd
forced him out of the department , right ?
yeah , well , that makes three of us .
the only difference is you got your badge back
and i &apos;m never going to .
there &apos;s a big difference . mapes was a gardener--
planting evidence , collecting ethics violations .
i wonder what they say about me .
you can &apos;t let ia tell the story .
that &apos;s exactly what fryer wants .
what does it matter ? they &apos;ve already won .
i have to move on with my life .
move on where ?
you &apos;re a cop .
yeah .
without a badge .
you remember when you shredded your knee ?
doctors said you &apos;d never get up on a board again ,
and you proved them wrong .
it &apos;s not the same.- it is .
except , on this one , you &apos;re giving up without a fight .
look , i appreciate everything you &apos;re trying to do ,
but you &apos;re wasting your time .
lori weston .
this is joe white ,
my old navy seal commander .
hi .
agent weston has recently joined the task force .
well , that &apos;s a step up from describing my role here as babysitting .
they were actually your words .
yeah , but you were thinking it .
okay ,
now she &apos;s a mind reader
as well as a profiler .
&quot; a welcome addition to the team &quot;
is , i believe , how he put it .
i said , given her bona fides , she would be welcome ...
uh , you two work out this little act beforehand ?
it &apos;s nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
sorry to hear about your friend .
mmm . steve is looking into it .
on the qt , of course .
speaking of which ...
hey , uh ... creepy .
why you dressed like inspector gadget ?
reopening a closed case without authorization
is considered risky .
so i took precautions .
uh , all right . what do you got ?
after carefully studying the blood spatter patterns ,
i noticed there were subtle deviations
that i can &apos;t account for .
so i ran gsr tests on the victim &apos;s clothing
as well as the tent wall samples ,
factoring in velocity relative to the hand position ,
which is , of course , after i recalculated
the bullet trajectories based on skull fracture analysis ...
wait . time out .
max , just give us the cliffs notes version .
okay ?
okay .
you were right .
this is a homicide .
the gsr gaps in the victim &apos;s hand ,
combined with the inconsistent blood spatter ,
leads me to believe that the killer placed the gun
in the victim &apos;s hand and then pulled the trigger .
this was a highly trained navy seal .
no one &apos;s just going to walk up and put a gun
in his hand and pull the trigger without a fight .
right . maybe he was incapacitated first .
yes . max ,
run a full tox screen , okay ?
after i officially ...
reopen the case .
somebody went to a lot of trouble
to make this look like a suicide .
right up through there .
how &apos;d you know where this was ?
he trained garcia .
seals are taught to minimize risk in the field ,
and this is one of the few defensible campsites
with a view of the trail .
would have been hardwired into him .
what was garcia doing up here , joe ?
when i got divorced ,
i packed up the pickup truck
and headed for the mountains .
which divorce ?
number three .
i was a mess .
i spent a week backpacking in the beartooths .
okay , so garcia comes up here
to wrap his head around the end of his marriage ?
sometimes you got to get off the grid ,
you know , regroup ,
put things in perspective .
his killer went to a lot of trouble .
think about it-- garcia-- he &apos;s up here isolated ,
probably not in the best mental shape .
got something !
he must have built a fire away from the tent site .
look at that .
what do you got ?
some kind of sediment in there .
okay , have fong run it and , uh ,
check the bottle for prints .
what is it ?
chin , let me see those crime scene photos .
garcia &apos;s pants and boots were caked with red dirt .
doesn &apos;t match the stuff here at his campsite .
probably took a hike .
yeah , well , he wouldn &apos;t hit red dirt
until got to the other side of that ridge over there .
my uncle used to take me up there looking for wild guava .
lead the way .
so how long were you and clay separated ?
we weren &apos;t officially separated .
but you asked him to leave ?
i ... i thought some time apart would help .
did you two have a fight ?
yes .
okay , can you tell us what it was about ?
it &apos;s not easy being married to a seal .
he was always away on some deployment ,
and i never knew when he was going to come back or ...
or if ,
and i couldn &apos;t just sit around here and wait .
so you took a job to keep busy ?
yes , waiting tables .
okay , um , but he did take a leave from the navy
to come back here and work on the marriage , right ?
i never asked him to do that .
being a seal was the one thing he loved .
more than you ?
i &apos;m sorry , i @-@ i didn &apos;t ... i didn &apos;t even offer you coffee .
i &apos;m fine , thank you .
marissa , can i ask you ,
was there someone else ?
clay was convinced that i was having an affair
with my boss at the grill .
were you ?
no .
but he wanted to believe
there was a reason why our marriage wasn &apos;t working .
and the truth was
i had fallen out of love with him .
did , did you tell him that ?
he took it pretty hard .
we &apos;re going to need your boss &apos;s name .
it &apos;s , uh , nick drayton .
thank you .
so what do you think ?
i think she &apos;s telling the truth .
about the affair or why her marriage imploded ?
she was being evasive about something .
i &apos;d like to talk to this boss of hers , check his alibi .
so how long were you married ?
that clearly has nothing to do with this case .
oh , no , your @-@ your body language says it does .
my , my body language ?
my body language is &quot; i &apos;m driving . &quot; see ?
yeah , no , you were , you were rubbing your ring finger .
every guy does it .
just means you &apos;re thinking about your own marriage .
oh , okay .
i just point out the obvious .
most men can &apos;t handle the truth when it comes to love .
we can &apos;t handle the truth when it come ... ?
what are we doing , a few good men ?
what truth can &apos;t ... what can &apos;t we handle ?
that marriage &apos;s fail .
well , what about you ?
you ever been married ?
no , no , i came close once .
you came close once ?
close is no good unless you &apos;re playing horseshoes
or hand grenades .
okay , what do you mean , clo ... ?
you either were married or you were not married .
no , close ,
like day @-@ before @-@ the @-@ wedding- bought @-@ the @-@ dress close .
wow , runaway bride .
what , what happened ?
you first .
no , it &apos;s very complicated .
yeah ? ditto .
listen , i still think we should go see
this guy garcia &apos;s wife wasn &apos;t having an affair with .
it &apos;s up here .
chin , chin , chin , freeze !
what ?
trip wire .
don &apos;t move .
listen to me .
just keep the pressure even , okay ?
don &apos;t shift your weight .
you hear me ?
yeah .
just don &apos;t move .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a shotgun shell .
all right , joe .
you got it ?
yeah , cut it .
clear .
crude but effective .
thanks .
hawaii &apos;s not exactly the place for ...
ieds .
it is if you want to keep your investment safe .
hidden dope grow .
gentlemen , who wants to retire ?
looks like a couple million dollars worth .
okay , so garcia goes hiking ,
he stumbles upon the growers .
how &apos;d he miss stepping on one of those shells ?
he was trained to spot stuff like that .
yeah , but he could have tripped one of these .
that &apos;s a motion sensor camera .
it &apos;s a pretty high @-@ tech operation .
growers monitor the site from some nearby location .
you think they &apos;re watching ?
let &apos;s hope so .
hey , man , you better take a look at this .
what the hell ?
come on .
there he is .
don &apos;t do it , don &apos;t do it .
car trouble ?
so the dea is paying
a visit to your little organic farm right about now .
roots and all , by the time
they get done weighing all those plants ,
you &apos;re looking at a good , long stretch .
this the part where i cooperate ?
&apos;cause it ain &apos;t gonna happen .
i got a lawyer for playing nice with you police .
no , this is the part where you tell us about him ,
and maybe
we take a little of that weight off the table .
that &apos;s clay garcia .
he was found shot dead up near your dope grow .
look at the photo .
you saw him , didn &apos;t you ?
he tripped one of the cameras .
you pay him a little visit ?
maybe .
don &apos;t mean i shot him .
no , sure , i mean , you look more like a pit bulls
and butterfly knife type of guy to me .
what do you mean ?
somebody shot him in the head ,
made it look like a suicide .
oh , yeah , that ain &apos;t my style ,
but you already know that , don &apos;t you ?
yeah , we already know that .
what we don &apos;t know is what happened after you ran into him .
why don &apos;t you tell us about that ?
dude was ice , man .
had my boy put a knife to him , and next thing i know ,
he &apos;s on the ground with busted fingers .
what did you do ?
told him to stay away from our grow
and we got no problem .
we left it cool .
anybody else up there with him ?
not with him .
we had another trip on the cameras .
went looking , but we couldn &apos;t find him .
what did this guy look like ?
don &apos;t know , some haole .
they all look alike .
yeah .
all right ,
how many of those trip cameras you got up there ?
six .
ain &apos;t nobody get near the grow
without us putting eyes on &apos; em .
we need to see that footage .
so caetano said
that somebody else was up there with garcia , right ?
did you get a description ?
yeah , haole-- we all look alike .
lori , i need you to pull footage off caetano &apos;s cameras .
i &apos;m betting our killer made a cameo .
okay , get right on it .
hey , hey , hey , hey ,
listen , she follows orders , she likes sports .
i mean , if she was into blowing stuff up
and romantic getaways at the dmz ,
i &apos;d say we are looking at a love connection .
that &apos;s funny .
garcia &apos;s wife give you anything ?
yeah , he thought
she was having an affair , uh , but she wasn &apos;t .
okay , you just took her word for it ?
yeah , i did , she seemed
pretty upset about her husband &apos;s murder .
you get a name ?
yeah , nick drayton .
he manages the hula room bar and grill ,
and i &apos;m guessing he is not the kind of guy
to kill a seal and make it look like suicide .
whoa .
evidence in a hit @-@ and @-@ run over in kailua .
you heard from kono lately ?
because she &apos;s not returning my calls .
i.a. investigation &apos;s got her all turned around .
you said on the phone you had something ?
yeah .
lab results came back on that bottle you found at the crime scene .
so the bottle was spiked with ketamine .
it &apos;s a sedative used to tranquilize horses .
what about prints ?
the victim &apos;s and another set of prints
that we ran through the system got a hit off a dui pop .
meet nick drayton .
wait a minute .
didn &apos;t garcia think his wife was having an affair
with a guy called nick drayton ?
yes .
so you drug a navy seal , and you make it look like a suicide ?
what are you talking about ?
all right , oh , oh , listen .
we just want to know , was his wife involved , yes or no ?
no . look ...
you , look , all right ?
what happened to your arm , huh ? garcia do that ?
huh ? huh ?
you &apos;re lucky he didn &apos;t do more for sleeping with his wife .
hey , hold on !
i didn &apos;t sleep with his wife .
let &apos;s get that straight .
i went to see him because marissa &apos;s a friend ,
and she was going through some tough times .
i wanted to talk some sense into him .
oh , that was nice of you . how about you explain to me
how your fingerprints got on a bottle of whiskey
that i found at the crime scene ? explain that to me .
how about the ketamine ?
the ketamine you slipped into his drink .
ketamine .
what is that ?
it &apos;s the drug you used to knock him out
before you shot him in the head .
listen , i told you guys .
i went to see him at his hotel room
to talk some sense into him .
all right ? he &apos;d been drinking .
and i @-@ i tried to take the bottle away from him .
bad idea .
i got a dislocated shoulder for being a good samaritan .
i didn &apos;t kill him .
i swear .
tell me something .
you buy this guy &apos;s story ?
yeah .
that &apos;s it ? just like that ?
mm @-@ hmm , yeah , pretty much .
okay , well , it still doesn &apos;t explain how and why
somebody would sneak onto garcia &apos;s camp site , drug him ,
shoot him and make it look like a suicide .
what &apos;s interesting to me is that all this guy was doing ...
all he was doing was trying to save his marriage .
that &apos;s not what got him killed , though .
he did everything he could , every single thing he could ,
and it just wasn &apos;t enough .
okay , who &apos;s marriage are we talking about ?
i mean , he takes a leave of absence ,
okay , to give it one last try , but no , no .
but see , me , if i would have done that , i guarantee you
rachel and i would still be together today , okay ?
well ... i wouldn &apos;t be talking on the phone to gracie ,
telling her why daddy only gets to see her every other weekend .
why are you blaming yourself , danny ?
max , what do you got ?
i think it would be a good idea
for you to come down here to the morgue .
why ? what is it ?
and you should bring commander white with you , too .
so who &apos;s this guy ?
a pickup truck went over the bridge
on h2 near the north shore .
i thought it was going to be another routine
traffic accident autopsy , but then
i saw this .
somebody want to fill in the civilian ?
yeah , yeah , danny , this guy &apos;s a member of seal team nine .
same as petty officer garcia .
yes , i remember it from the autopsy ,
but i found the coincidence
just a little too much .
whoa , this guy died in the car accident .
only it was made to look like an accident .
when an air bag deploys ,
it releases hydroxide propellants .
that &apos;s the stuff that makes
your nose and eyes watery
if you &apos;re lucky enough to survive the crash .
he wasn &apos;t lucky , max .
i had the lab pull the air bag .
hydroxide ?
yes , even in traffic fatalities such as this one ,
hydroxide is found in the sinuses and the lungs .
but when i autopsied , the lungs were clear .
meaning he was dead before the accident .
yes . also found high levels of ketamine in the blood ,
as well as suspicious amounts of head trauma
that didn &apos;t match the amount of damage done to the vehicle .
somebody is systematically
knocking off the members of seal team nine .
hells bells , tolvin ,
put some stick on &apos; em in my pool !
it &apos;s not synchronized swimming .
swim or die , boy . swim or die .
you &apos;re getting soft in your old age , wade .
why don &apos;t you jump in the pool and show &apos; em how it &apos;s done ?
wade . steve , this is co wade gutches ,
sd team one .
commander steve mcgarrett . commander .
heard a lot about you and your task force .
you , too , sir .
you got a minute we can talk ?
yeah , sure .
what &apos;s up ?
hoping you can help us with a case .
it involves the seals .
is mp , provost marshal involved in the investigation ?
just five @-@ o , sir .
two teams guys have already shown up dead .
one was made to look like a suicide ,
the other a car accident .
petty officer garcia
didn &apos;t kill himself , though .
he was murdered .
and the other seal ?
petty officer jamsek .
he was killed last night , sir .
both men were members of seal team nine .
platoon is stationed on the island for covert training .
we have reason to believe , sir ,
these men are being targeted
because of their involvement with seal team nine .
you know these guys better than anyone .
is it possible that a team member has gone rogue
and is out there killing off seals ?
nobody else knows who they are , so ...
no , there &apos;s no way navy seals are behind this .
okay , well , that &apos;s why we need the names
of all the men on that seal team .
oh , you know i &apos;m not at liberty to give you that information .
it &apos;s classified .
sir , i understand if you have to run this up the chain of command ,
but i need to cross @-@ reference their after @-@ action reports
so i can work out who &apos;s going after these boys , and why .
afraid i can &apos;t help you .
wade , we need to end this
before another one of these men dies ,
and we can &apos;t do that without your help .
we owe them at least that , sir .
oh , you know that tiki bar
i took you to last time you were here ?
sure do .
meet me there , 20 hundred .
don &apos;t be late .
all right , ladies ,
bottom of the pool , let &apos;s go .
where are we going ?
come on .
what , are we picking up your boss &apos;s shirts ?
oh , you &apos;re funny . really .
hold on .
guns .
two to you , frank .
fold .
officer kalakaua .
or should i say , ex @-@ officer kalakaua ?
kono &apos;s fine .
frank delano .
i &apos;m sure you know who i am , though .
i &apos;ve heard a few things .
we &apos;re starting to get a reputation , huh , ray ?
gonna have to do something about that .
i heard about you on the force .
that &apos;s ancient history .
moved on to greener pastures , as they say .
much greener . come .
sit .
you want a drink ?
no , thanks .
i don &apos;t trust cops who don &apos;t drink .
especially ex @-@ cops .
so have a drink .
to captain fryer .
don &apos;t worry .
fryer and his ia rat squad
will get theirs .
not soon enough .
listen , kono ,
i don &apos;t want to sit around all day and play footsie .
a person with your skill set and job experience has
a certain value in my line of work .
and what kind of work is that ?
it &apos;s kind of like police work .
except the bad guys we take down ,
we don &apos;t read miranda .
we just take their money .
so you provide a public service .
something like that .
so , why am i here ?
i have a job opening .
what kind of job ?
think i &apos;d like to ease you into it first .
provide us with some information
about an upcoming hpd raid ,
and ... we &apos;ll see how that goes .
how do you expect me to get you that kind of information ?
you &apos;re a ...
resourceful woman , kono .
you figure it out .
wade .
sorry about having to shut you guys down earlier .
base is crawling with navy intel .
there &apos;s no need to apologize .
had a serious security breach recently .
and seal team nine &apos;s identities got compromised
in the security breach , didn &apos;t they ?
among other things , yeah .
but we think the hacker
was targeting this information specifically .
and your investigation confirms that .
all right , when did this happen ?
a week ago .
intel brass is trying to run down the source of the breach .
all right , well , it &apos;s definitely connected to those murders .
i mean , whoever stole that list
is picking off seals .
i did run that up the chain of command ,
and we are in the process of locating
and returning to base all the active and
reservist members of seal team nine ,
and that , gentlemen , is all i can tell you .
listen , we &apos;re up and running on this investigation , you understand ?
by the time the provost marshal gets savvy ,
more seals could be in danger , if not dead .
copy .
but you , more than anybody , should understand
that i cannot compromise an ongoing naval investigation .
now , i said , i &apos;ll do what i can .
thanks for the beer .
that was a waste of time .
nice of him to leave us a little reading material , though ,
even though it &apos;s a year old .
last june , sinoloan cartel ,
headed by rafa alvaro ,
was raided by a joint dea task force .
i , uh , i studied the aerial surveillance photographs of the raid ,
and this thing has got the seal team nine signature all over it .
textbook seal team direct action .
well , rafa &apos;s brother juan
was not captured in the raid and swore to avenge his brother &apos;s death .
whoa @-@ whoa @-@ whoa , i thought the raid took out the whole cartel .
juan was able to pull the organization back .
of course , it helps the cartel took in over $ 700 million last year .
that money buys a lot of breaching of covert seal team lists .
and revenge .
source of mine at nsa says
the cartel hired a hacker to break in
to the supposedly secure naval database .
so the cartel steals
a list of seals and sends a hit man to knock &apos; em off ?
but does it in a way that won &apos;t alert the others .
cartel sends in a pro .
i &apos;ve cross @-@ referenced a list of known cartel associates with
an image of our mystery man
from the dope grower &apos;s surveillance tapes .
i enhanced the image ,
did a point @-@ to @-@ point comparison
and got a match .
hector ruiz , suspect in over 40
drug @-@ related murders , including the assassination of a mexico city police captain .
one of his nicknames is el camaleon-- the chameleon .
so we &apos;re looking for a lizard .
this guy is not your average point @-@ and @-@ shoot assassin .
i mean , he &apos;s smart . he &apos;s ex @-@ zeta .
all right , did you run
him through the homeland security database ?
yeah . but he &apos;s got over 50 known aliases ,
flawless fake passports .
well , to plan this kind of job ,
he &apos;d need a base of operation .
here we go .
okay , ruiz rented a beach house in mokuleia .
looks like the homeowner ran a credit check
on one of ruiz &apos;s aliases .
clear .
clear .
our boy &apos;s been busy .
these are all members of seal team nine .
operation strawberry field ring a bell ?
what did you say ?
operation strawberry field .
it &apos;s got a picture of you .
the photo ... you ...
it &apos;s classified .
oh , my apologies .
el camaleón just unclassified it .
joe .
that was commander gutches .
only one member of
seal team nine is unaccounted for .
lieutenant ... bradley jacks .
not answering his cell phone .
no , wait @-@ wait . according to this ,
he &apos;s scheduled to sky @-@ dive from dillingham airstrip right now .
you ready to do this ?
oh , you bet .
it &apos;s gonna be a scorcher .
roger that .
want to make sure you hydrate , bro .
thanks , man .
five @-@ o ! don &apos;t move !
hands . hands .
both hands up .
gun !
he &apos;s alive .
nice work .
so what , you &apos;re not gonna tell me
about operation strawberry field ?
no .
no , no , &apos; cause you &apos;d have to kill me if you told me .
keep that up .
i &apos;m just curious , though .
is there an operation abbey road ?
are you the walrus ?
time to shut up ?
roger that .
okay .
you ready for the magical mystery tour ?
i &apos;d like to offer my thanks for your actions
in rescuing lieutenant jacks .
just doing our job , sir .
hell of a job , commander .
outstanding work .
thank you , sir .
now you get to see
the long arm of u.s. justice .
welcome to operation payback .
using intel seized during your investigation ,
we were able to locate the alvaro cartel compound .
navy seals made visual contact at 1900 hours ,
breached perimeter forces with little resistance ,
and are in place to put the alvaro cartel out of business ...
permanently .
looks like it &apos;s a go .
watch this .
you did this stuff ?
i neither confirm nor deny .
glad you &apos;re on our team .
me , too .
target eliminated . repeat , target eliminated .
