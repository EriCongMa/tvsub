"We Gotta Get Out Of This Place"
Well, thank you.
Uh, Richard, happy birthday.
Now, you're only saying that because you heard her say that.
Uh...guilty.
Actually, can you come and find me at the end of your day?
I need to talk to you about your surgical schedule.
Oh, is that right?
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
Well...
Catherine let it slip that she was gonna be here today,
so I'm assuming there's some sort of something.
Don't worry. Don't worry. I-I like surprises.
I'm sorry, but...it is actually about your surgical schedule.
Bailey, you can't lie to me.
Well -- I don't know anything about any party.
Happy birthday, though.
Oh, oh, I do have something for you, though.
Owen, you shouldn't have.
I didn't. It's from the hospital.
Uh, make sure you come and see me at the end of the day.
That would be great.
There's a stage you go through during childbirth.
and it's the toughest part.
It's called the transition stage.
Hey, happy birthday! Happy birthday.
That's great.
It was.
You've been pushing so hard and so long...
You're exhausted, spent.
And there's nothing to show for all of your effort.
Oh, my god! There she is!
Okay, well, she's not a she.
She's an it, and she's fragile, so don't touch it.
Sorry, I'm just, uh, extremely excited.
Well, you're not gonna be printing anything just yet.
Isn't that the job?
I -- you hired me to help re-engineer
your -- your portal veins.
I beat out 100 bioengineers for the gig.
I've, uh, cooked up a couple of designs.
Oh, that's awesome.
No, actually it's presumptuous.
Until you've read every scrap of data
on every test we've run, you touch nothing.
There are the research binders,
Great. Can I, uh, touch the chair?
Keep an eye on him. He touches nothing.
Do you want me to watch him read?
Yes!
During this transition stage, it feels like you can't go on.
But it's only because you're very nearly there.
Your son is 4 years old?
4, yes.
And he's had two previous conduit failures.
But your conduit works, right?
From what we read, baby Nathan is doing great.
Yes. It was successful in Nathan's case.
This clinical trial
is to identify certain aspects of the procedure.
But he'll get the conduit?
If you're chosen for the study.
Dr. Yang has the final say,
And I'm forwarding your materials on to her.
Number 14 looks good --
Some EC-TCPC narrowing with early signs of obstruction.
There is evidence of
You, uh, picking research subjects today?
How's it going?
Uh, good.
Shane's meeting with the candidates.
I'm only looking at the hearts --
Trying to keep my judgment unsullied.
But it's hard finding candidates that meet all the criteria.
Yeah.
You need this.
What? A...hypoplastic left ventricle?
No, like an algorithm --
Some scientific way of choosing the perfect mate
where you input only the criteria you want,
and you're presented with only suitable candidates.
So, internet dating.
Oh, right. They have that.
Listen, I don't need a date. Okay?
Oh, uh, keep me posted on the hearts.
How long does it take to wash one, like 10 seconds?
Look, I don't like a filthy kitchen, either.
Dirty cereal bowls in the sink
aren't gonna exactly tip the scales.
Oh, my jesus.
Well, now that he's in the conversation,
I'll make sure to clean the bowls tonight.
Your mother. Your mother.
She does not look happy.
Come on. It'll -- it'll be fine.
Okay. All right.
But y-y-you told her, right?
Her? I did.
How did she take it?
So...
...I understand congratulations are in order.
And how long have you been experiencing this pain, Greg?
You know, comes and goes.
10 years.
10 years?
Mm-hmm, since we've been married.
He won't go see anyone.
I just got Obamacare.
I'm a junk collector.
I s-sell stuff at flea markets.
Doesn't really make for regular coverage.
Oh, there's definitely a mass here.
Oh, it's cancer.
Is it cancer?
Jodi.
What?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing. Uh, could be minor.
We'll know more when we get a c.T.
See? I knew we should have come in earlier.
What did you see? Was it bad?
If it was bad, why do you look so happy?
Just get him to C.T. And speak to no one of this -- no one!
You paged me? Hey, Callie.
What happened to my surgery?
I was supposed to remove the sensors on Will Mitchell,
And, uh, I found out my surgery was canceled.
Yeah, that's why I paged you.
Uh, Dr. Torres came to me with a concern
about an intellectual-property conflict between you two.
What, is this about the sensors?
Yes, Derek. It's about our sensors.
Look, l-l-let's just talk.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
Who's this?
Oh, that's Paula.
She's my lawyer.
Is it?
Is it?
It is!
What?
Look at it, Murphy.
It's glorious.
It's a mass.
I-it's a massive mass, but --
Oh, my God.
Okay, so, we're gonna need a 3-D reconstruction and, um --
Hey, Dr. Bailey. Hey, do you have the labs on the -- um...
I said, "Tell no one"!
I didn't!
Tell no one what?
Is that a --
Yeah! Okay, keep your voice down.
I want in.
No! It's mine.
It's ours.
Page Dr. Webber.
Why him?
It's his birthday.
I'll be forwarding your materials on to Dr. Yang.
Thank you, doctor.
We'll let you know.
Oh. Sorry.
Hi. I'm here for the HLHS trial.
Yes, and you are --
Sheryll Jeffries.
Oh, no, I'm not on the list.
That stupid nurse of whatever she was said I didn't qualify.
I'm what you're looking for.
HLHS with at least one failed conduit procedure.
That's me.
Ah. I'm...sorry, Sheryll.
The study is for pediatric patients over 1.
I'm 17. I am a pediatric patient.
We're looking for pre-pubescent specifically --
kids that are still growing.
That's perfect.
I just had a huge growth spurt.
This is the first time since I got knocked up
by someone said I'm too old for something.
Look, I'm due in six weeks.
I want a heart that's gonna survive it, okay?
And why do you need me to look at it?
It's for your birthday.
No more talk about my birthday.
I mean, there are fine surgeons working well into their 70s,
and I am nowhere near 70.
Will you just look at the monitor.
Let's see. Okay. Well...
Oh, my word.
I-I-is that a little leg?
And a spinal column.
It is.
It's a fetus in fetu.
It is.
The man absorbed his own twin.
He did.
You know, in all my years, I've never seen one.
Neither have I!
Neither have I!
Well... hot diggity!
Happy birthday.
Ah, look at that. Oh, my.
A love contract?
Where did Grey get this, Zola's Barbie dream house?
No. It's a real thing. I swear.
"We confirm that any sexual and/or romantic relationship
is completely voluntary."
This is so creepy --
like we have to vow to the hospital Gods?
Hey, Alex, we have a transoral fundoplication.
I sent you the latest labs.
What's that?
Oh, it's really, really cool.
First, we go in orally,
and then we go in through the belly button
to fix a kid's reflux without leaving a scar.
It puts the "fun" in "fundoplication."
God, that does sound fun.
Yeah. See? You could get on that.
Just sign that, and you could be back on peds.
Yeah, I'm not signing that.
I have a twin?
You did -- in utero.
Oh, gross. He ate his twin?
Absorbed it.
Or rather enveloped it.
Greg, you developed around it.
Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, I'm gonna need a minute.
Is it dangerous? I mean, can it kill him?
Jodi.
No. In many cases, it's harmless,
but Greg's is the source of his pain,
so that likely indicates that it will
cause problems if it hasn't already.
Good news -- we were able to
schedule surgery today to remove it.
Stop calling him "it"!
Everyone needs to slow down.
I just found out I have a brother.
I'm sorry, Sheryll.
I wish I could help you, but rules are rules.
Just bend them, okay?
I can't.
Sheryll, please, if I could --
My water broke. I think.
Oh, boy
I need a wheel chair here!
I'll get one.
And page labor and delivery!
Right away.
Can I call the baby's father, your parents?
My parents don't talk to me.
Not sure who the father is --
probably why my parents don't talk to me.
The person you call is Dr. Yang.
And tell her to make an exception.
She's too old.
You need a refresher when puberty begins, Ross?
I know. I just... thought we could bend the rules.
And skew the results of the trial.
No, but this patient -- - I told you.
I don't want to know about the patient so I'm not influenced.
I only want to see the heart -- a heart that has had
a previous surgery to correct the defect,
is currently in poor cardiac health,
and is in the body of a kid between the ages of 1 and 12.
A heart that is still growing -- is this that heart?
So, I was thinking about this whole internet-dating thing.
It takes five minutes.
Wait. That's why you paged me?
You said this was urgent.
It is. I'm about to get busy with this trial.
And you need someone to snuggle with on rainy seattle nights.
Ooh. Say that in your profile.
I-I, uh -- I got to go. I got to go.
Callie, this is not something I'm doing to you.
I have a signed contract with them.
Yeah, that you had no right to sign.
You signed away something that's ours.
Come on. We spent half the day together yesterday.
We were on a playdate.
Why didn't you say something then?
We were with the kids.
Oh, we have Sophia's dressy doll.
I think Zola thought it was hers.
Ha.
What?
Oh, like father, like daughter, I guess.
I think we're -- we're -- we're drifting here.
Yes, yes, you're right.
I'm sorry. That was unprofessional.
What I should have said was...
"The sensors are materials that you co-developed with me
"in service of research I started
and invited you to participate in."
If you attempt to impair my access to these materials,
I will have you prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
Well said.
This is insane.
You don't have a case.
Listen, before anyone resorts to litigation,
let me just take this before the other board members.
Maybe we can find a solution that is fair to both parties.
In the meantime, I want you both to leave this matter alone
until you hear from me?
All right?
I'm sure it was a shock. I mean, I was shocked.
I can't even imagine what you must be feeling.
Actually, I can. I can imagine it because I --
You know what? Babe, don't. She doesn't care.
But I know why you're here, mom,
and I could have saved you a trip.
I already called Mike Farris.
The time to call Mike would have been
before you stood up at that...barn.
Wait, who is Mike Harris?
"Farris" -- he's our attorney. Avery foundation.
Protects our financial interests.
Um, are you suggesting that I'm after your money?
I have no idea what you're after, dear.
All right, that's enough.
You're not gonna march in here
and start questioning my wife's character.
You want to talk about her character?
She left a man at the altar.
She broke his heart and humiliated him
in front of everyone that he loves.
I have no idea what she's capable of, never mind you.
I am not interested in your money.
Wonderful.
That's what I said when I married into the Avery family,
and you know what I did next?
I signed a prenuptial agreement.
I said I'd handle it. This is totally inappropriate.
What's inappropriate is the engagement
was 15 minutes at a rest stop on the turnpike.
Fortunately, postnuptial agreements
were created for moments like this.
And this meeting is over.
Jackson.
It's over!
Look at this. I --
I'll sign the stupid paper.
Really -- I don't mind.
You're not signing anything.
Why not? I don't want your money.
I want you.
A prenup or whatever the hell it is
is only for if we get divorced, which we're not gonna do,
so it doesn't matter.
April, that is not the point, okay?
This is a conversation for you and I when we are ready,
not for her to come barging in dictating terms.
But it will calm her down.
I'm part of her family now.
I don't think an olive branch is the worst thing in the world to offer.
Yeah, well, you're a better person than I am.
Well, yes.
And than she is.
I'm better than everyone.
Mnh-mnh. Not right now.
We can let her stew for a while.
Wait, wait, wait.
Le-- I -- - Come on.
I hate you.
I know, right? Do you want to see?
No. I want to work on that printer.
And it's my job to make sure he doesn't.
Seriously?
Yeah. Don't...
That's what you're doing instead of this.
Oh, come on!
All right. What is that?
Okay.
Have you ever, ever seen anything like this?
Oh, holy god!
No, I never wanted to! What is that?
It's a fetus in a fetu.
That I am down here not seeing.
I can totally read without supervision --
Been doing it for years.
That's not reading.
That's doodling. Read.
Well this has been fun,
but I have to take a man out of a man.
Want another peek?
I'm good actually.
That -- how would it work?
Theoretically.
Let's go. Keep it moving, people.
Everybody needs to take a look because this, my friends,
is the Halley's comet of your careers,
as rare, wondrous, a-a-and fleeting --
Dr. Hunt. Can I help you with something?
Yeah, I just came to have a look.
You know there's a line.
You're --
You're serious?
I'm deadly serious.
These kids want to learn. Back of the line.
Thank you.
Now, you notice that the absorbed twin
gets it blood supply from the renal artery.
First glance -- nothing special.
Take a second look, and... the Mona Lisa.
We will start by cutting through the adhesions.
Once that occurs, we'll move on to the right --
We're not taking him out.
What do you mean?
You heard the man.
My little twin is an incredibly rare find.
Uh, yes. Y-y-yes, it is, Greg,
but, uh, it...still has to come out.
You want to destroy the Mona Lisa?
No.
I won't sign the consent.
I mean, you're fixing baby hearts,
Derek's mapping the brain, and I'm --
have the most amazing surgery ever.
I mean, please, tell me this is pressing --
Nowhere near the heart.
Hey. Did you see this?
Oh, that the absorbed twin?
Technically, that's a peds case.
Back off. It's the reason I live.
Aw, she's mopey 'cause she let a lab rat loose in her lab.
Boo-hoo. You gonna eat that bacon?
No, it's like leaving your kids with a babysitter.
I mean, you say, "Put the kids to bed at 7:00," But will they?
Or will they drink all your tequila, pass out,
leave the gas on, the whole house blows up,
and everybody dies?
Okay. What do you think of her?
She's hot, right?
Have you given up on men?
No, for Owen.
There is this internet-dating site.
There are pages of women like this.
Owen should be doing this, right?
Yes.
Why don't you just keep banging him?
At least it's legal for you guys.
You know, Jo's not gonna sign that stupid love contract
you gave me.
Why not?
Oh, I don't know. Because it's stupid.
I knew I shouldn't have given it to her.
Just tell her it's just a stupid piece of paper.
Yeah, if she runs, I'm blaming you.
She looks like she's 20.
She's cute.
I hate your husband.
Owen said not to talk about it.
I'm not. I'm talking to myself.
I hate Derek Shepherd. Really? Why?
Oh, 'cause he's an arrogant, stealing bastard.
I totally agree.
Do you ladies think she's hot?
Yeah, very.
And now I hate you.
Nice.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
I got to go.
What did you do?
D-- he talked the man out of surgery.
Now he loves his little brother --
Can't bear to part with him.
What?
I was explaining the uniqueness of his condition.
Apparently, my words...cast a spell.
Okay, so, now what do we tell him?
How do we get him back?
Tell him
it could have adverse effects on his blood pressure.
Tell him it could explode.
Tell him it's a demon.
Oh, that's good.
Okay, stop!
I ruined it. I-I'll fix it. I'll talk to him.
What are you gonna say?
I don't know!
I'm coming with you.
This is the worst birthday ever.
Oh, hey. Hey, did you talk to Dr. Yang?
Ow! Sweet, geez.
What did she say?
She...
She didn't say.
She was busy.
Oh, damn.
She said no. She said no.
Ohh. Look.
They said I'd be dead by 15.
I-I dropped out of high school.
I hitchhiked. I had sex.
I'm having this baby because I thought I was gonna die.
Now that it's coming, I really want to live.
I want the chance to be her mom.
So, can you please bring Dr. Yang in here
so I can talk to her, please?
For my baby. Oh!
Okay, okay, breathe.
I am breathing!
Hey. What are you do--
What are you doing?
Webber's post-ops.
Since he got the fetus in fetu, I get this.
Well, I'm heading into the fundoplication,
and you'd be there, too, if you were in peds.
No.
Okay, look, I thought it was nuts when Mer gave it to me,
and I knew you'd hate it, too.
But, honest to god, it's just a piece of paper that says --
It's a legal document, Alex, so it's not just --
What is your problem?
In my experience, you sign papers,
and it's a kiss of death.
You sign a marriage license, and the romance goes away.
She signed a DNR two days ago.
Guess what. She's using it.
Hey, Alex. Our guy's being prepped. Ooh.
For what?
Our fundoplication.
Is that the cool transoral thing -- cutting-edge,
only being done in a few top-level peds-surg programs?
Yeah, that's the one.
Okay. Let's do it.
I'm not talking to you.
Okay, then just listen.
If you understood what the brain-mapping project can do,
you would share your technology.
Oh, share?
I'm sharing now? You're stealing it.
You're stealing it.
Callie, the brain
has more nerve cells than humans on earth.
We want to understand how all those neurons interact,
so we're gonna start with a smaller group
like everybody here in the hospital.
And we're gonna determine how
they interact with each other and talk.
Please, stop.
And then we move out.
Stop patronizing me, all right?
You're just saying that your thing
is more important than mine.
I'm saying my thing feeds your thing.
It will revolutionize our understanding
Of what it means to be human.
And yet, you would have never had the sensors
if it weren't for my thing, you selfish --
Selfish?
Here! Let me show you a diagram.
This is you.
I'm an asterisk?
No.
You think you are the white-hot center of the universe.
Also, it looks like a butthole.
Either way, it works.
Sheryll, this is Dr. Yang.
Dr. Yang, I-I'd hug you, but -- ow!
Just breathe. I can wait.
No, I'm fine.
Uh, my doctor wanted to put me on a transplant list,
but I heard about your success with baby Nathan.
Dr. Ross, this is the patient you already spoke to me about.
Listen -- I know you're only looking for little kids,
But can you please, just --
Please! Aah!
You know, just let me... take a listen here.
Oh, my goodness. Thank you so much.
You have a slight murmur, but, besides that, you are well.
Your O.B. will monitor your cardiac function,
and page me if there are any complications.
Good luck.
Dr. Ross, a minute?
I'm sorry.
She just really wanted to have a chance to plead her case.
That was out of line. I already said no.
I know it was wrong. I'm sorry.
She doesn't meet the criteria. It's that simple.
I know it's hard
because they're kids and they're dying.
And they've got their stories and lives and family --
Well, she doesn't!
Her parents don't talk to her.
Ross, stop it.
You're too emotionally involved,
and you've gotten her hopes up.
It's gonna be worse on her when you tell her no.
Do your job.
Do you have my discharge papers?
Uh no. No, no, I don't.
I think you need to reconsider.
You need to have this thing removed, Greg.
Dr. Weber, you said it was incredibly rare.
And it's mine.
People chuck stuff all the time,
no clue of the -- the value of the thing
that they're throwing away.
Finding treasure in their trash is what I do.
And I didn't have to dig through
anyone's yard-sale crap to find this.
It was inside of me all along.
This is a wad of bones and teeth.
It's not some crummy box of VHS tapes.
We've talked about this.
Analog's coming back in a big way.
Just because it's rare doesn't mean it has value.
A heart has value. A liver has value.
Actually, I'm on Greg's side here.
No, you're not.
People do throw things away too easily.
They throw out people just like that.
They're done with you,
and then they throw you out with the trash.
Sir.
I'm not gonna do that, Greg.
Stop!
Yeah, stop.
Okay, Greg, I have a proposition for you.
You let me remove this fetus in fetu,
and I promise you I won't throw it in the trash.
I'll throw it in a jar, and you can take it home.
You aren't serious.
It'll look a hell of a lot better on a shelf than in your belly.
And you won't have that pain anymore.
You can do that?
I do it all the time.
It comes down to this.
My research is just as important as yours.
You're talking about microscopic neurons.
I'm talking about giving a person
the ability to walk again.
It's just as important!
And you wouldn't have come up with the sensors
if it wasn't for my work.
The sensors were an answer to a question that I asked you.
It was my answer!
Wh--
Don't fight this, Callie.
You don't want to.
Oh, why, 'cause you have government lawyers now?
I'm not gonna be bullied.
You don't have a case!
My name is on the material,
and my name is on the patents.
They're mine. You can hear it from me now.
Or you can hear it from a judge in court.
My suggestion is to save your time and money.
Listen to me... as your friend.
I'm sorry.
I feel terrible.
There's a reason you feel terrible.
It's 'cause it's the wrong thing to do,
and you know it.
You're not used to answering to people,
and now you have the president himself
calling you on the phone.
And you're afraid to say no...
Even though you know this is 100% wrong.
You're a good person.
That's why you feel bad -- 'cause you should.
Down to seven -- that's fast.
I know what I want.
Uh, did you do the profile?
What? The dating thing? No, no.
Cristina, I-I've spent my morning trying to figure out
a way to fix this thing between Torres and Shepherd.
I haven't had time.
Sit. I'll do it for you.
Describe yourself.
No.
Stubborn.
Listen -- I'm not being stubborn.
I'm just -- - Smart, athletic.
Listen -- I'm too busy to --
"A busy professional seeks" what?
Nothing. I seek nothing.
Ah, "Seeks same, someone who is passionate about her work..."
..."someone who's..." Come on. What?
Fine. Fine.
Um...someone who doesn't care to cook
or get out of bed when it's not a work day.
Someone who sleeps so soundly and peacefully
that...I have to check her pulse sometimes.
Someone who's suffered...
and understands suffering.
I'd keep it more upbeat.
D-- to the point that I don't have to say a word.
She just -- she just looks at me and sees
who I am and how I feel... and accepts it.
You know, she doesn't try to change it,
doesn't want to change it.
That person.
There's a billion people out there.
But I imagine... there's only one her.
I am happy to sign the document.
That's wonderful.
I don't have a pen.
No, sweetheart, you don't...
actually sign it here.
You review with your lawyer.
And he will then confer with our family lawyer.
I-I will consult the lawyer.
Good.
Now, let's talk about the children.
Oh, my god.
Will you have children?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. I said, "Yes."
In what religious tradition will they be raised?
We don't know.
We haven't talked about what religious tradition
we will or won't raise our theoretical children in yet.
That's a conversation you might want to have.
Avery children become Avery Foundation board members.
The foundation controls $480 million in charitable funds
for the advancement of medicine.
What?
Your children, when they are 15,
will start sitting in on board meetings, you know,
begin to learn the business, like Jackson did.
When they are 18, they will gain a seat on the board.
They will be voting members.
You are a born-again Christian, who I presume is pro-life.
That's right.
Will your children be taught that people
who are pro-choice go to hell
or their pro-choice father
is going to hell or their grandmother?
Wait.
Whoa!
I-I don't think anyone is going to hell.
I-I-it's so much more complicated than that.
Will they stop supporting medical institutions
that perform abortions or provide information
about abortions like, for example, this hospital?
Will they vote to stop supporting stem-cell research?
We'd all like to think that the problem at the table
is the meddling mother-in-law
who didn't get to walk her son down the aisle.
But I have built a massive institution
with my blood and my sweat, and you will inherit it.
And, one day, your children will control it.
And I don't get the impression that either of you
has given a moment's thought to what that means!
Hello, little brother.
I see a finger.
No, two... three fingers.
Gross!
Where?
He just wants to try the printer.
Why does he need to?
Because it's why he's here.
And as long as you won't let him do anything,
I can't be in here.
Tell him I said no.
Is-is that an ear?
An ear?
No, that's a lung.
That's a lung.
But that is a tooth. A tooth.
Oh, and that is a spinal column.
Look! Every damn vertebrae.
I still want to know what you said to get him to consent.
He promised him a doggy bag.
You didn't.
I did.
He's right. It's part of him.
He should be able to have it and share it.
This is of great medical interest.
That's valuable.
You don't... hide it inside
of...some basement
or... let it rot away.
You share it.
You let people benefit from it because, if you do,
you can change the face of medicine.
Oh, my god, I'm gonna say
this to you for the last time, all right?
This relationship is not new. This decision was not rash.
You only feel that way
because you didn't get to weigh in on it.
Because you didn't include me in it,
like everything else in your life.
I don't need to include you!
You include yourself in everything always!
Stop! Oh, stop it! Stop it, both of you!
April, sweetheart, don't -- - No, stop it!
You're right.
There are a lot of things we still haven't figured out,
but we will figure them out -- Jackson and I.
But if you-- if you think that I am judging you
or anyone because of my beliefs,
then I'm -- I'm so sorry because I'm not.
That is not me. And--
I-I-I would love to talk to you about that sometime,
but I-I-if it's our children that you are so concerned about,
if they disagree with you on some things,
if that's not okay with you,
then... I-I-I don't-- I don't know.
Restructure the board?
I'm-- I'm making this up. I have no idea how it works.
Clearly.
Look, the point is there will be a way to figure it out.
We did something that wasn't responsible,
but we did it because we love each other
and we want to spend every day together until we die.
I am sorry.
No, you don't have to apologize to her.
I do.
I do. We got married.
We had a wedding, and all she got
was a phone call after it was over.
If our kids do that, I will--
I will kill them with my bare hands.
We made a huge mess.
We hurt Matthew, and we hurt Stephanie.
And we hurt you.
And I am so sorry.
And I'm gonna spend the next I don't know how many years
trying to make it up to you.
Apologize to your mom.
Come on.
Can you stand up?
What the hell were you thinking?
I love her.
Mom.
And I am sorry.
But I love her.
She's the one.
You could have had grandma's cake topper.
It's Limoges.
I know. I know.
I'm sure it's lovely.
Okay.
Can't do it! It hurts.
The epidural's worn off, Sheryll.
You've really got to start pushing.
I can't. I'm trying. I swear I can't do it.
God, I just want my mama!
Somebody, please, call my mom!
Sheryll, your baby's almost here.
Just hang in there.
I can't!
I can't. Can you please call her?
Tell her I'm really sorry, and I need her really, really badly.
I can't do it. I just need my mama.
Her blood pressure's skyrocketing.
Prep an O.R. For a C-section.
We'll call your mom, okay?
But you're gonna have to do this on your own.
I know you can. Just push.
Come on, Sheryll. Push.
One more time. Push!
Sheryll, you did it.
I did it?
You did it, Sheryll.
Hey, Lloyd.
How's everything at the N.I.H.?
Uh, hello, Derek.
I -- we, uh, still can't see you.
Yeah, we're working on that.
Lloyd, I have Dr.Callie Torres here.
She and I developed the sensors together.
Hi, Lloyd.
He can't see you.
Look, Lloyd, I'm afraid this whole proprietary thing
isn't going to work.
Dr.Torres' and my work has to continue with our sensors.
Derek, uh, before we, uh -- we continue,
I should tell you that we are here
with some folks from the N.I.H. And, uh, the White House.
Here we are.
Gary Neal, director of N.I.B.S.,
and Sid Garret, our presidential liaison
for the bioethics committee, and this is
Robin Marks of the European Brain Initiative,
And you know, of course,Linda McCrary.
And, uh, I -- I'm sorry. I forgot your name.
Yeah, I'm glad you're all there.
Actually, um, this affects all of you.
Lloyd, our work to map the brain is like the brain itself.
It's dependent upon connections,
our innovation and inspiration of scientists
like Dr.Torres and millions of others.
If we have a policy that thwarts innovation,
then we're stopping before we even start.
It's a-a fundamentally wrong approach,
and I can't support it.
Okay.
We are willing to share our sensors with you
but only if our work continues --
If everybody's research continues.
Dr.Shepherd, your contract is very clear.
We have sole right to your sensors, or you are out.
Then I am out.
The president himself --
You can tell that to the president.
Better yet, get him on the phone.
I will tell him myself.
Either the policy goes, or I go.
We will...
have to... figure out...
a...way to share.
In the meantime, you can send us the plans for your sensors,
and, uh, Dr.Torres, of course, uh, should continue her work.
Thank you...uh, Lloyd, for your cooperation.
I'll talk to you soon.
Yes!
Greg. Jodi.
Okay, everything went very well.
We're going -- - you promised me.
Cough it up. Murphy.
Thank you.
Oh, my god! That's horrible!
Thank you for taking that out of me.
Take that away. Take that away.
Thank you. Ohh.
You stupid idiot.
You want me to take that back to path?
Oh, are you kidding me? This is my birthday present.
Uh, speaking of which, I'll see you, what,
In about, uh...half an hour?
Sir?
Okay, now you're making me feel bad.
W-what -- if I'd have known you wanted a party,
I would have -- look, uh, come to dinner with me and Ben.
Oh, oh, please. Please, we'd love to -- we'd love t--
Uh, B-bailey, stop. Bailey.
Bailey, I was just joking.
Go and have fun.
S...
Happy birthday.
No, it's good.
Edwards.
Oh. You had one job.
Dr.Grey, we were just, uh, looking at Eric's designs,
which are actually kind of amazing.
I'm fired. I'm totally fired.
Listen, Gary.
Uh, Eric.
What-- whatever.
This was my mother's project.
I took it over. It's my project.
So, it's sort of like my family heirloom.
I totally get it. I have this teacup --
It's my baby, and I failed it.
No, you didn't.
Stop talking.
I failed it, and that's not okay
because other people's babies are growing.
They're thriving. They're saving lives.
They're getting pats on the backs from presidents.
And mine is sitting in a basement,
and we need to change that.
She said "We."
Yeah, it's a good sign.
Have a seat.
Before you start printing,
I want to go over a few things with you.
Well, I'm good right here.
I said "Sit."
So, the first time we printed, I think where I went wrong is...
She's so beautiful.
You're telling me she's gonna
have to grow up without a mother?
There are other options.
You can ge on a transplant list.
And maybe the next phase of trials
will be more inclusive.
But I want this one.
I am so, so sorry.
You don't meet the criteria.
Call your mom.
I bet she's worried about you.
Honestly, I'm really proud of my boy.
He had the stones to stand up and ask for true love.
I -- that's scary.
Of course, I would never tell him that.
What's the matter with you?
You were quiet all the way here.
Are you sad because no one celebrated your birthday?
Oh, come on. I'm not a child.
Hunt's trying to push me into retirement.
What?
He started the day by handing me directions to the pasture.
And you told him where to stick it, right?
Oh, come on.
Don't slow down on me now.
I'm ready to start the next part of my life.
And I thought I was gonna do it with you.
If you're not up for it, you'd better step aside.
And if you are, you...
Let's go.
All right.
Now smile.
And act surprised.
What?
Surprise.
Happy birthday, sir.
You looked right in my eyes, and you lied to me, Bailey.
Yeah, but it didn't count because you were being stupid.
Happy birthday.
Well, thank you. Thank you.
Hey, Arizona told me that Jackson put together
a committee to look into this thing for you and Callie.
My god. Whoops. You can tell him to stop.
You need a drink?
Yeah.
You can have a drink. - Wait, well -- well, what happened?
We overthrew the government today. We're thirsty.
I don't -- what?
How are you doing?
Okay.
Here's your drink.
I'll be better once I've had this.
Here you go.
Women love you.
You've had over 20 responses.
I narrowed it down to 10.
You should look these over. Pick three for coffee dates.
Okay, I got to go talk to Webber, and, after that,
I think we should get out of here.
Owen.
You could just wait here.
Or we could meet back at your place.
Owen.
See?
I can get in trouble for that, and I don't want to.
This isn't a promise of anything.
You want a promise? I can promise you this --
you can't count on me, 'cause stuff happens, you know?
Houses burn. Cars crash. People get sick.
One of us could die tomorrow.
I promise you cannot count on anything,
But this makes it so... I can kiss you whenever I want to.
I don't want the stupid running around and hiding.
I want to kiss you when I want to kiss you.
Yes.
I know.
Know what?
What religious tradition I want to bring my kids up in.
You said you don't -- you don't know, but I do.
It's important to me that they're Christian.
I thought you knew that.
That my kids would have different beliefs than I do?
That's -- that's a little weird, April.
Transition is movement
from one part of a life to a whole new one.
A-a-and board meetings at 15?
I kind of pictured my kids in 4-H.
Like raising pigs?
Or cows.
It's important that they're comfortable around livestock.
Is it?
Jackson.
They'll ride horses at boarding school.
They're going to boarding school?!
And it can feel like one long, scary, dark tunnel...
So, this morning, I mentioned
pulling back on your surgical schedule.
You want to do this now -- on my birthday?
Look, I'm sorry, Hunt, I'm not retiring.
You can force me out, but I'm not --
I'd like to appoint you director of the residency program.
You'd be in charge of all the decisions
regarding the educational arm of this hospital.
...but you have to come out the other side...
I can teach. I'm good at it.
But you bring something to it that I just can't.
Well, what's that?
You.
Take some time to think about it.
I'd like to make a toast to Dr. Webber.
Me, too.
What?
Not before I finish mine.
While you guys fight it out, I just want to say...
I wouldn't be here if it weren't for Dr. Webber.
Thank you, sir.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
...because what's been waiting there...
Cheers.
Cheers.
...might be glorious.
Residency director?
