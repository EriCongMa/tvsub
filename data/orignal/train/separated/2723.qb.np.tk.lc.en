listen , i can &apos;t stay .
i got a meeting i gotta go to .
i got something i wanna say .
my cousin anthony went into business for himself .
we all know this .
in a way for which there is no excuse .
he &apos;s got a problem with rage .
he disappointed me , anthony , in ways that i can &apos;t even begin to tell you .
and he put us all at risk .
irregardless ,
it &apos;s been made clear to me that if they put their hands on him ,
he will not be dealt with quick .
we &apos;re talking torture .
for that reason , even if i knew where my cousin was and i do not ,
i would not deliver him up to them .
i am offering him the same protectionthat
i would offer any of you in similar circumstances .
i know what you &apos;re gonna say . &quot; hey , i would never do what he did . &quot;
god bless , i hope not .
but we are a family .
and even in this fucked @-@ up day and age that means something .
so we are gonna deal with this as a family , together .
no matter how it affects anybody
personal safety @-@ wise , financially @-@ wise , whatever .
i see that my nephew isn &apos;t here and it &apos;s important he lam it now .
it &apos;s my desire that you circle the wagons , you support him .
until and as such ...
raymond . i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t stay .
happy birthday , huh ?
thanks
gentlemen , enjoy your dinner .
see ya , t.
thank you . that was great .
thought you had raymond &apos;s birthday dinner .
i left early .
it &apos;s nice you &apos;re home .
there &apos;s chicken parm .
was christopher there ?
no .
did you know that him and adriana broke up ?
this kid , that &apos;s his trouble . he keeps it all bottled up .
then they wonder why they get chemical dependencies .
do you think there was somebody else ?
there was this one night , it was way back ,
movie night with the girls . adriana was upset
and wanted to get something off her chest . then she ran out crying .
i &apos;ll bet she was seeing somebody .
you never know about people .
his plans were often startling , instinctive , spontaneous ,
and not infrequently , obscure .
his men idolised him and had boundless faith in him .
after being promoted in 1916 , he joyfully returned home on leave
to marry his sweetheart , lucie maria mollin .
she would be the love of his life to its end .
rommel saw the huge assault on france forming ,
and he saw that a new armoured weapon ...
i still love this old house so much .
i should do half so good with my stupid project .
... almost precisely what he had done as a lieutenant during wwi .
i &apos;m sorry , did you wanna be alone ?
no .
... blitzkrieg in its truest form . it was rommel ...
he had what the germans call fingerspitzengef党l ,
which is a sixth sense of sizing up a situation .
claude rains .
thanks for doing this .
bout 1500 there
should tide you over .
hey , sil .
hey , kid .
you want something ? fries ?
it &apos;s fuckin &apos; something , this situation .
right .
i can &apos;t even get down to milt &apos;s , fence some jewellery .
everybody with eyes in the back of their head . damn it . i was tony &apos;s driver .
it &apos;s amazing . you want me to be honest ?
the favouritism tony still shows for our fuckin &apos; cousin ,
after what he &apos;s done ?
what does tony b have on this guy ?
i might take a bullet for this skeeve .
after all your uncle &apos;s done for you ?
i need to get into specifics ?
you said you went home .
i gotta talk to you , tone .
about what ?
i &apos;ve been your consigliere for years .
don &apos;t go into a fuckin &apos; preamble . tell me what &apos;s on your mind .
you got some unhappy people out there .
no shit .
not just the young guys .
guys that &apos;ve been with you since the beginning .
before the beginning . guys who worked for your father .
fuckin &apos; paulie , right ?
i &apos;m not saying nothing .
goddamn him .
these guys ,
would do whatever you ordered .
except in this case .
don &apos;t say it like that .
forget that tony blundetto &apos;s my cousin .
i give him up , we can give the whole fuckin &apos; thing up .
here &apos;s where the conversation gets difficult .
go .
all due respect .
you were ready to hand him your cousin a week ago .
it &apos;s not about standing with the guys or upholding some rules . not really .
then what &apos;s it all about ? why don &apos;t you illuminate me ?
it &apos;s about you don &apos;t wanna eat shit from john .
you don &apos;t wanna bow down .
you told him to go fuck himself .
which , to be honest , wasn &apos;t exactly appropriate , considering .
oh , is that right ?
all due respect .
what the fuck do you know what goes on in my head ?
i &apos;ve known you since you were a kid .
frankly , you got a problem with authority .
this attitude of yours ,
it &apos;s a lot of what &apos;s made you an effective leader .
but we all got flaws . even you .
seven deadly sins and yours is pride .
all due respect .
you got no fuckin &apos; idea what it &apos;s like to be number one .
every decision you make affects every facet of every other fuckin &apos; thing .
it &apos;s too much to deal with almost .
and in the end , you &apos;re completely alone with it all .
i &apos;m sorry you feel that way .
this is the course i &apos;ve chosen ,
and those of you that are not with me on it , well ,
that makes me sad . and it &apos;ll be dealt with in time .
you need me for anything else ?
benny , right ?
how ya doing , mr leotardo ?
i &apos;m sitting listening to wfan and i go ,
isn &apos;t that the kid that used to drive for tony ?
i &apos;m on my way to the hospital .
well , that &apos;s up to you .
no , i mean my mom , she ...
where &apos;s his friend ?
what friend ?
don &apos;t fuck with me , kid ! don &apos;t fuck with me !
where &apos;s blundetto ?
i don &apos;t know !
it &apos;s a start .
jesus .
he has a fractured skull .
is he talking at all ?
a little .
listen , ben , i want you to know that ...
... it &apos;ll be taken care of through the plumber &apos;s union health plan .
you know what ? we were talking here .
it &apos;s time for you to get your own customers .
you &apos;re getting a little too old to be beating people up .
where &apos;s larry ?
he &apos;s staying home .
he &apos;s the boy &apos;s godfather .
he called me . said he was gonna be with the kid .
house arrest .
all right .
this is fucked up .
what do ya wanna do about it ?
what do i wanna do ?
i want that man there to do something about it
i want him to give us the ok to go to brooklyn ,
clean some timepieces over there .
tony blundetto whacked the brother of a captain .
if tony tried to strike at them again , we should take him out .
look , just give me that first one , the oregonian . $ 39.95 .
you &apos;re sending a fruit basket to the kid . he &apos;ll appreciate it .
it &apos;s for mel . the poor guy had a stroke .
he &apos;s younger than me .
melvoin ?
jesus christ , that &apos;s terrible .
that &apos;s why i asked you to come over .
his speech ... he &apos;ll sound a little suonato , probably forever .
but get this , nine months , maybe a year ,
till he can work a full schedule .
they &apos;ll have to postpone my retrial .
no shit ?
the question is ,
should i use the stall , but then get a lawyer who &apos;s more with it ?
you heard about this thing with phil and john ?
bobby said something about this .
that you &apos;re losing money , probably .
i am ? how much ?
i don &apos;t know , you gotta talk to him .
does john do your collections ?
look , uncle jun &apos; , what do you think ?
phil beat one of my guys to within an inch of his life .
next time he &apos;ll kill somebody .
what can i do ? it &apos;s my cousin .
did i give them the office address or the home ?
i &apos;m talking to you .
he had a stroke .
you want it to go to the wrong place ? it &apos;s fruit , it &apos;ll rot .
i pinned myself into a corner here ,
and i don &apos;t see a way out .
but he wasn &apos;t made , right ?
the kid ... phil &apos;s son .
it &apos;s ok , forget it .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m fuckin &apos; nonplussed with all this news .
frankly , i don &apos;t know .
tell phil .
tell phil what ?
where you going ?
you wanted to confer with me ?
nah , it &apos;s not important .
make sure you eat a lunch today .
poor fuckin &apos; feech la manna . tony sent the wrong ex @-@ con back to jail .
you realise i had an entire container of
imported provolone coming in saturday ?
and fuckin &apos; phil and them put it on a truck ,
took it to westchester instead of rahway where we always split the loads .
jesus . that shit is liquid gold .
tony knows what has to be done .
tell john where to find blundetto . he just won &apos;t do it .
as if he even knows where tony b is .
give me a fuckin &apos; break . of course he knows .
it &apos;s christopher i feel for .
please ! let me tell ya something .
soprano is very adroit. at keeping his family outta the frying pan .
both cousins . the rest of us ...
how &apos;s life now that you &apos;re back home ?
i had a dream a couple of weeks ago .
before i moved back , a recurring dream .
i see my old coach from high school .
what happens ?
he told me back then , this guy , he said ...
he said that i was special .
you never told me this .
为什么现在突然要说 ?
does everything i drag in here gotta be a dead dog ?
我去见了我儿子的足球教练
see , he was starting my boy and now ...
see , he was starting my boy and now ...
what &apos;s the reason ?
well , aj &apos;s just devoting more energy to academics .
he &apos;s determined to get into a good school .
how &apos;s things on other fronts ? your cousin ?
well , you touched on something there that &apos;s not so good .
what &apos;s the problem ?
i really can &apos;t talk to you about it .
this is very difficult for me , treating you ,
when so much of your life is closed off .
how many times can i say this ?
look , i &apos;m not trying to be difficult here .
it &apos;s just that it affects me tremendously ,
this trouble he &apos;s gotten himself into ,
so i &apos;m upset !
well ...
and i care about him so much .
you care about him so much ?
we spent hours getting to the realisation
that your feelings for your cousin stem from guilt and shame .
do you remember that ?
do you care ?
it &apos;s just that it doesn &apos;t matter now ...
it &apos;s just that here we are , as always , back at square one ,
with you going into high @-@ sentimentality mode .
sentimentality mode ? we were children together !
look , it &apos;s a lot like with your son .
here &apos;s what i bet the coach didn &apos;t tell you .
what you wanted to hear most ...
is that your son is special too .
what i &apos;m saying is , whatever you wanna do ,
vis your cousin , your son , whoever , own your feelings !
i &apos;m very confused .
but ...
we can &apos;t talk about it .
it &apos;s my mess .
all my choices were wrong .
how much ?
it &apos;s five bucks .
five bucks .
your cup &apos;s your admission pass .
where are they from ?
montville .
they gotta go .
totally .
hello ?
chiara !
no , you gotta come up greenbrook road .
patrick said to tell you some people have bogus cups .
they brought them with them to get out of paying .
hey , man , let me see your cup .
it &apos;s in the athletic department .
we &apos;re getting ripped off .
this isn &apos;t downloading music . that beer is our property unless you pay for it .
fucking manners !
speak .
who is it ?
open this door !
i wanna talk to you . i hear you got some beefs .
do you wanna phone everybody ?
what the fuck ?
i know you said you wanted it burnt , t , but the picture moved me .
but the picture moved me .
cos you knew it cost me an arm and a leg .
it &apos;s museum @-@ quality work , i admit that .
but i told the guys
a chance to hang a picture of you on my wall ?
i rescued it from the flames .
what &apos;s with the hat and shit ?
don &apos;t give me &quot; huh . &quot; you know what it does to me ?
to be reminded of that fuckin &apos; horse ?
i &apos;m sorry , t.
but you never come here no more .
i didn &apos;t figure there &apos;d be a problem .
i never come here no more cos they &apos;re watching all our houses .
it &apos;s no good for us to visit .
i know .
do you and your whores get a big laugh ?
that &apos;s no joke .
then what is it ?
that &apos;s no joke ! that cost me a lotta money to get the retouching done .
what the fuck did you do it for ? and don &apos;t bullshit me , paulie .
part of it was to fix some fire damage on the guy &apos;s feet .
but while i was at it , i also thought , i don &apos;t have a modern look in here ,
so go with something more traditional ,
that catches more of what you &apos;re all about .
a goddamn lawn jockey ?
that &apos;s not a lawn jockey . that &apos;s a general .
what general ? who ?
it &apos;s not a real general from history , it &apos;s you .
what the fuck .
speak .
he &apos;s at 146 , route 9a , kinderhook .
skip .
how &apos;s it going ?
we got you your bialys and coffee .
johnny sack called for you . called a couple of times .
he seemed upset about something .
good bialy .
any time , boss .
catch ya later .
take it easy , tone .
what ?
it didn &apos;t solve a thing .
it &apos;s over , john .
the fuck it is !
he &apos;s beside himself now .
the best thing for him , for you , for all of us ,
is to put this thing behind us and get back to business .
how is that supposed to happen ?
it &apos;s something we gotta talk about .
as a first step , i &apos;d consider giving phil
a quarter of my points in the bloomfield operation ,
which my cousin was running .
i &apos;m at columbia pres all day , my yearly physical .
an hour already , i &apos;m waiting for this doctor .
then i got bone density tests ,
lipids . come into the city tonight .
no offence , john , but i got an iq of 136 . it &apos;s been tested .
all right . tomorrow morning then , my house , 6 : 30 .
what ?
i &apos;m on a 9.00 a.m. flight to miami .
i have to get things in line there .
you think i &apos;m gonna give you ammazzo with ginny upstairs ?
if you don &apos;t hear from me , i &apos;ll be there .
tony , you and you alone .
i &apos;m not having phil , nobody .
who is it ?
it &apos;s me .
you need to go up to the farm and pick up your cousin .
i need you to go up there now , this morning .
it may be over , but watch your back .
take him off the premises , obviously .
he should be buried .
it should be you that does it .
you got it .
we never got a chance to talk in detail about adriana .
i know .
if you let something slip ,
if she saw anything ...
there was a couple of times i had her with me
picking up collections . esplanade .
the cigarettes ... she was always nosing around .
did you ever say anything about ralph or the bevelaqua kid ?
no .
would you remember ?
i swear on my life .
you won &apos;t find any of that .
i &apos;m reading , i &apos;m lifting weights .
i know what you think but you &apos;ll see . i &apos;m gonna prove myself to you .
i only chipped that once , on the day with her .
she was willing to rat me out because she couldn &apos;t do five fuckin &apos; years ?
i thought she loved me .
she &apos;s a cunt .
does no good to think about that now .
all right . he does like her .
he does like her .
cos he told me .
i have heard you talking all night .
could you knock ?
you said you &apos;d finish your application .
you &apos;re gonna stroke out if you can &apos;t find a way to control yourself .
i know .
hang that phone up .
call me back later ?
i don &apos;t know what to say , you know ?
if applications are late , you are cooked . it &apos;s that simple .
i know this because i have raised you from day one ,
you won &apos;t like working at mcdonald &apos;s .
could you up the drama a little ?
you know what ? i don &apos;t like the sarcasm ,
and i don &apos;t want you around here next year sponging off of us , so fine .
no allowance until those applications are done .
that &apos;s not even practical and you know it .
what &apos;s the matter ?
he hasn &apos;t done his applications .
he isn &apos;t getting allowance .
no allowance .
i have $ 300 of my own money .
how ?
me and matt put on a party .
$ 5 a person .
we made 600 bucks after expenses .
what expenses ?
the band .
is that why you &apos;ve been on the phone for two weeks ?
it may interest you to know
people said it was the best party all year .
there was drinking ?
we just let people into matt &apos;s house .
what they brought with them was not under our control .
do your applications . now .
what ?
you know , it &apos;s interesting .
i was talking to his college advisor ...
who , wegler ?
no , aj got switched around . miss merrow .
she mentioned that aj talked to her once
about what might be good schools to study event planning .
event planning ?
what the hell is it ?
i am not really sure .
gay , isn &apos;t it ?
i don &apos;t know .
i know you &apos;re around a lot of wealthy people .
he watches that dvd over and over again .
the one with mike myers about ...
what &apos;s his name ? steve rubell , the studio 54 guy ?
oh , jesus .
yeah , but i mean , you know , it ...
well , i guess , you know ...
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s fired up about something at least .
so ? go ahead .
phil has to know that punishment has been meted out and that &apos;s all there is .
and that what we are here for , in the end ,
is to put food on the table for our families ,
our sons , the future .
that &apos;s what &apos;s important .
he doesn &apos;t accept that . his family &apos;s smaller by one .
well , then , my friend , it &apos;s up to you to make him accept it .
me ?
let &apos;s talk , john ,
about the 500 @-@ pound elephant in the room .
you started this cycle of bloodshed
when you whacked the girl carmine used to fuck .
when you whacked the girl carmine used to fuck .
lorraine calluzzo was not a girl ,
and what kind of a man bangs his second cousin ?
what are you , the frigging cardinal ?
you wanna shut down our joint construction jobs ?
eat k @-@ rations ? fine .
you want phil to put one in one of my guys ?
that &apos;s gonna go a long way to making you the rich prick that you want to be .
what do you suggest ?
whatever his legitimate sorrow , he &apos;s got a price .
he wants to provide for his family .
and ?
and what ?
meet his price , and that &apos;s it . i don &apos;t wanna hear nothing else .
oh , you don &apos;t ?
i &apos;ve paid enough , john .
i &apos;ve paid a lot .
maybe i could sell it .
truth is we &apos;ve had discussions . i gave him the sports book .
why didn &apos;t you say that , you cheap fuck ?
cos i don &apos;t like it .
he &apos;s gonna want consigliere or ...
let &apos;s not go backwards now .
these people you run into who wanna be boss , huh ?
they should know .
i told you .
you don &apos;t listen , you nut .
it &apos;s good ... seeing you again .
i still look forward to working with you , john . i mean that .
you want a coffee ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
fbi , open up !
i &apos;m the gardener .

the feds just hit johnny sack . you heard anything ?
i had gendler on my cell phone all the way over here .
jimmy petrille was a collaborator .
they took down the whole
petrille crew plus johnny .

if he hadn &apos;t died .
jimmy petrille ? he &apos;s a sweet old guy .
he gave them gambling , homicides , trafficking ...
18 fuckin &apos; years &apos; worth . it &apos;s a major kreplach , my friend .
i was fuckin &apos; there .

no , of course not .
anyway , you weren &apos;t named in the indictment , obviously .
it &apos;s brooklyn . they weren &apos;t coming for you .
so frankly , were i you , i might actually consider laughing .
or rub a hunchback &apos;s hump . or something .
yeah .
be of good cheer .
call you when i hear more .
