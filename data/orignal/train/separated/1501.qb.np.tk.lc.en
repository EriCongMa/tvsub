yeah , honey , mitchell helped me
pick up the shirt . you &apos;re gonna love it .
oh , i wish i could pick you up some lip gloss
but we are already at the car .
okay , bye , honey .
getting pretty good , huh ?
yeah , but you were always good .
i &apos;m just glad you stuck with it .
seriously ?
what ?
it &apos;s playing itself .
i didn &apos;t know .
you honestly thought that i just became a piano virtuoso , dad ?
you knew my whole life .
have you ever seen me take a lesson ?
i thought maybe you were self @-@ taught .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re right .
like when i taught myself to play the clarinet .
exactly .
i never played the clarinet .
can we drop it ?
let &apos;s go get an ice cream .
what about my lactose intolerance ?
oh , i &apos;m not loving this game .
this sucks .
my teacher gave me mononucleosis .
as a parent , i feel i should ask about this .
slow down . it &apos;s not like she gets that many tugs on the line .
it &apos;s for a.p. bio .
we have to write a report about a disease ,
and i got the worst one . this is a joke .
actually , it &apos;s pretty serious .
back in college , i caught mono
from my roommate , ling .
served us right for fooling around .
never share a flute , kids .
hey , can you drop me off at the library ?
sorry . i &apos;m meeting some friends at that coffee shop on lake .
you mean the one next to the library ?
that &apos;s a library ?
i thought it was a church
for a religion that didn &apos;t allow makeup .
when is the washing machine gonna get fixed ?
i &apos;m wearing a swimsuit underneath my pants .
everybody &apos;s gonna have clean clothes soon .
the repair guy &apos;s supposed to come today
between 10 : 00 and 2 : 00 .
oh ! honey , can you be here for that ?
can i sit around in an empty house and wait for someone ?
baby , i &apos;m a realtor .
i have a license for that .
you sure you don &apos;t mind ?
go . run your errands .
it &apos;ll give me a chance to get started on these dishes .
oh , good . all right , come on , luke .
all right . see you guys later .
oh . more dishes than i thought .
that lasagna &apos;s gonna be a tough one .
somebody &apos;s gonna need a scrub brush .
hello ?
what ?
no ... way !
june 10 , 1988 .
carla concannon and i spent the afternoon
frolicking at the public pool .
later , at her house , things got private
while a 45 of carly simon &apos;s
&quot; nobody does it better &quot; played .
with me .
i always thought it &apos;d be fun to own that 45 .
when the record store finally called that morning ,
i ran right down so i wouldn &apos;t miss the repairman .
i had to have it .
it was the chance to relive
those magical 3 minutes and 42 seconds ,
which was also the length of the song .
but then it dawned on me --
i was cheating on my wife
with the red @-@ hot memory of another woman .
i could not let claire find out .
i had to destroy the evidence .
luckily , i &apos;m cool under pressure .
what ? ! no !
when did he ... ?
come on !
there were a couple of snags ,
but i think i covered my tracks pretty well .
i &apos;m so sorry it took so long to get you these clothes .
i left them in the back of my car
and completely forgot about them .
sounds familiar .
i was in the pharmacy for three minutes .
you had a cracked window and a juice box .
let &apos;s retire that story .
can i wear this for the family photo ?
oh , honey , that &apos;s adorable , but , you know ,
gloria wants us in jeans and a black t @-@ shirt --
classic and casual .
and then maybe afterwards , we can stop by
and change the scenery in a high @-@ school play .
that is a really cute dress .
oh , yeah , thank you . just got it yesterday .
really ?
it reminds me of something i gave you six months ago .
do you ever put her in the girls &apos; hand @-@ me @-@ downs ?
oh , yeah . all the time .
really ?
because if my girls &apos; old clothes aren &apos;t to your taste ,
i could always just ... give them to somebody else !
okay , calm down , claire .
your voice is getting to that pitch that disturbs our cat .
oh , my god .
you will not believe what dad just said .
so , we &apos;re at the mall , right ?
and there &apos;s a piano there . i sit down behind it .
i start ...
come on , mitchell .
he &apos;s just not wired for compliments .
i &apos;m sure your playing was great .
i don &apos;t play the piano . i &apos;ve never taken a lesson .
are you sure ?
oh , my god .
my own family doesn &apos;t even know me .
mitchell , please . don &apos;t be so sensitive .
you don &apos;t see me pitching a fit
because cam is too much of a snob
to use our hand @-@ me @-@ downs .
sn-- i &apos;m sorry -- snob ?
i will have you know i come from simple farm folk .
there is permanent dirt underneath
these fingernails from working the soil .
really ?
i had no idea that re @-@ potting your orchids
counted as &quot; working the soil . &quot;
okay , they &apos;re in soil , are--
you know what ? i don &apos;t want to talk about this .
i don &apos;t need to listen to this .
i &apos;m gonna go out and get some air .
i know the feeling .
retire it . seriously .
does joe look a little pale to you ?
this whole country looks pale to me .
i think he needs
a little color for tonight &apos;s photograph .
what do you think is the minimum age for a spray tanning ?
now that joe is here
and that his head is finally normal @-@ shaped ,
i decided to take a new family portrait .
hola !
how did it go at the mall ?
bought a shirt , angered my son --
another successful outing .
ooh . i &apos;ve been wanting to do this .
quick -- what &apos;s the ring around an angel &apos;s head ?
what ?
halo !
you did the angel one !
ordinarily , i &apos;d be delighted ,
but this isn &apos;t gonna be one of our fun chats .
you mean like that time you called me
when you saw that blimp ?
it was so low , they waved back .
i &apos;d done a pretty good job
eliminating all traces of that record ,
but there was still one loose end .
you know , earlier today ,
when we ran into each other on the street ?
i didn &apos;t see you . you didn &apos;t see me .
okay , so you &apos;re saying
whatever either one of us might have been doing
will remain forever --
i didn &apos;t see you . you didn &apos;t see me .
just to be c-- hello ?
jay &apos;s so cool . he gets it .
i didn &apos;t know what he was talking about ,
but i needed him to keep his trap shut .
you see , lately , i may have been dabbling
in something that ... strong , virile men like me
aren &apos;t supposed to be dabbling in .
and it wouldn &apos;t exactly fit my image
if people found out i was considering entering ...
a certain adorable dog in a dog show .
gloria thought i was out getting my tires rotated .
actually , i was buying stella a decorative show collar --
you know , just in case .
i figure if she looks beautiful ,
she &apos;ll feel beautiful .
guess who we ran into at the library .
how would i know ? i was here the whole time .
sanjay patel . he &apos;s got crohn &apos;s disease .
no !
i know . so lucky .
he &apos;s totally going to win that science scholarship .
he should use it to find a cure for baldness ,
&apos;cause that kid is 16 with a comb @-@ over .
that &apos;s it !
i &apos;m just gonna pick a new topic .
i want a disease that everyone in the school
is going to talk about .
all right !
why are you standing there ?
&apos;cause i missed you . i love you so much .
oh , wow . love you , too .
how &apos;d it go with the repair guy ?
the repair guy came , but i missed him .
&quot; why ? what were you doing ? &quot;
&quot; listening to a record . &quot;
&quot; what record ? &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not important . &quot;
&quot; phil ! &quot;
&quot; the soundtrack to my first sexual experience
that i think about from time to time .
honey , where are you going ? ! don &apos;t take the kids ! &quot;
he didn &apos;t show up .
what ? ! that is so annoying !
i know . put away your groceries .
i &apos;ll call him and reschedule .
no , no , no , no , no . you are too nice .
i am calling .
i am not resting till i get to the bottom of this .
it &apos;s no big deal .
it &apos;s not the first time i &apos;ve been stood up by some guy .
oh , listen to your words , phil .
yep . yep .
she called me a snob , mitchell .
i &apos;m -- oh , i &apos;m sorry if i don &apos;t rush
to throw lily in every bargain @-@ bin rag
claire tosses our way .
you &apos;re not really shedding the &quot; snob &quot; tag with that .
look , why don &apos;t we just put lily
in one of alex &apos;s shirts for the picture tonight ?
she &apos;ll see right through that .
no , you &apos;re thinking of haley &apos;s shirts .
no , i mean it &apos;ll look ke we &apos;re doing it
just because she brought it up .
well , i know . that &apos;s why i &apos;m looking for a photo
of lily in a hand @-@ me @-@ down to show claire ,
but i @-@ i can &apos;t seem to find one .
by the way , i &apos;m barely in any of these .
mitchell , are you suggesting what i think you &apos;re suggesting ?
yes ! sometimes i feel like this family looks right past --
you &apos;re suggesting that we stage a photograph .
put lily in some hand @-@ me @-@ downs .
make it look like it &apos;s from the past --
christmas , say -- just to prove claire wrong .
simplicity itself .
that &apos;s not remotely what i &apos;m saying --
mitchell , don &apos;t second @-@ guess yourself .
it &apos;s simplicity itself .
yes , once again , i would like to speak to a supervisor .
listen , if my husband said nobody came , nobody came .
dad , it &apos;s your move .
no , i think i should just play it cool for now .
i &apos;m so sorry .
score !
i got a disease that &apos;s rare and fun
- narcolepsy .
the company swears that the driver was here at 10 : 00 .
they &apos;re putting him through to me right now .
i &apos;m gonna chip away at his story .
let &apos;s see how you get out of this .
i &apos;m thinking .
it &apos;s a neurological condition
where people under extreme stress actually fall asleep .
it &apos;s like a way for the brain to escape .
i bet he was doing something he shouldn &apos;t have .
i &apos;m just gonna let him keep talking till he makes a mistake .
everybody makes mistakes .
and the noose tightens .
why were my headphones in the couch ?
oh , good . you do keep gps logs on all your drivers .
there &apos;s no way out .
let me just write down your name .
hey , does anybody need a receipt from flipside records ?
damn it !
i didn &apos;t even see that !
i see you &apos;re registered for tonight &apos;s show .
first one , huh ?
yeah .
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m comfortable
with that whole prancing @-@ in @-@ a @-@ circle thing
in front of everybody .
can someone else run her through her routine ?
it has to be the owner .
i suppose that &apos;s the best . we have a rapport .
all right . see you at 5 : 00 .
5 : 00 .
uh , i got a family thing at 5 : 00 .
do these things tend to start on time ?
of course . it &apos;s not a cat show .
well , i better speed it along . come on .
i can &apos;t believe mom made me take you here .
this is my only black shirt ,
and mom needs me to wash it .
it &apos;s only when i see the less fortunate
that i realize how lucky my clothes are .
all the machines are taken . we &apos;re gonna have to wait .
oh , i am not spending any more time
in fluorescent lighting than i have to .
you &apos;re gonna sneak your shirt in with someone else &apos;s load --
like that guy &apos;s . go that way .
i &apos;ll distract him .
excuse me .
haley ?
oh , my god . kevin .
it &apos;s &quot; keith . &quot;
you really don &apos;t remember
the guy you abandoned at coachella ?
i didn &apos;t abandon you . i @-@ i texted you .
that deejay put me in a trance .
yeah . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s almost
like you were using me for tickets .
oh . that &apos;s crazy .
can you get those again ?
or was that just , like , a one @-@ time thing with your uncle ?
it was a one @-@ time thing .
okay , so , good seeing you .
yeah .
remind me never to date you .
you wish .
please . i could totally get you .
like to see you try .
all right , lily , can you come in here , please ?
it &apos;s christmas already ?
probably should have prepped her .
okay , no , it &apos;s not actually christmas .
we &apos;re just gonna take a fun photo .
which i am going to be in because i am a member of the --
where is my stocking ?
oh , relax .
it &apos;s not in the shot , and neither are you .
here -- i want you to take the picture from right over here .
this way . okay , great .
lily , i want you to put this on
and then stand in front of the tree , and we &apos;ll pop a shot off .
ooh ! look at all the pretty presents !
those are just empty boxes .
you &apos;re killing me !
i don &apos;t know which one it is !
i didn &apos;t see him put it in !
wait ! i think i found it .
he &apos;s coming !
what ? ! no !
what are you doing ?
uh , i @-@ i saw that your laundry was done ,
and i was gonna fold it for you to make us even
for what you thought that i did that i didn &apos;t do .
even ?
i held your popcorn for eight hours
waiting for you to come back .
i walked all the parking areas twice ,
checked every medical tent .
by the time i got back to my car ,
it had been broken into and the battery was gone .
i had to trade my festival pass
for a ride home in a horse trailer .
but ...
looks like someone got a concert t @-@ shirt .
dad , is there anything bothering you
that might be causing -- i don &apos;t know --
major psychological stress ?
no . i &apos;ve been acting normally , haven &apos;t i ?
did something happen earlier today ?
uh , nothing at all .
because you seem a little tense .
what ? no , i don &apos;t ! stop badgering me !
i love your mom ! let &apos;s listen to some music .
boy , the way you cook things up sometimes ,
it &apos;s a little --
dad !
what ? !
you fell asleep !
it &apos;s like the fifth time today .
i think it has something to do with that guy
not showing up to fix the washing machine .
well , that &apos;s not exactly what happened .
you snuck out to buy
&quot; nobody does it better &quot; from flipside records ,
and he showed up ?
that &apos;s more exactly what happened .
how do you know all this ?
i &apos;ve been watching you all day .
i think the guilt from that has been causing you to fall asleep .
so you know about carla ?
i do now .
dad !
what is happening ? !
i was skeptical about the jeans and t @-@ shirt ,
but i like it .
any chance the photographer could fire off a couple solo shots ?
look at the bottom of joe &apos;s face .
what happened ? did you leave him in the sun ?
no , i took him out for five minutes
to give him a little color .
i must have not closed the visor all the way down .
why is it so important to you that he has color ?
because we &apos;re sending this picture
to our family in colombia ,
and i have a son that doesn &apos;t even look colombian .
now they &apos;re gonna look at this picture ,
and they &apos;re gonna think that i am a terrible mother ,
that i can &apos;t even take care of my own child .
i think your reputation is set .
i can still do this with my arm
&apos;cause i slept in the sink till i was 3 .
ha @-@ lo !
people are here . i &apos;ll deal with joe .
okay .
come on , buddy .
ohh . come on .
hola . claire is on her way .
dad , you have to confess to mom .
clearing your conscience is the only way to make this stop .
really ?
i hope so , or else i have to rewrite the whole end of my paper .
just the two of you ? where &apos;s the rest ?
i had hoped to get this picture thing wrapped up by 5 : 00 !
they &apos;re all coming separately .
cam , do me a favor -- call mitchell and light a fire under him .
i &apos;m right here , dad .
oh . good . i didn &apos;t see you come in .
you opened the door for me .
you thanked me for bringing a bottle of chardonnay .
doesn &apos;t sound like me .
hey , guys . we &apos;re here .
finally . let &apos;s do this .
luke , where &apos;s your black shirt ?
right here . i &apos;ll get changed .
all right . shake a leg .
hey , sweetie .
hi !
hey , lily , be careful .
don &apos;t get anything on that beautiful outfit .
recognize it ? look familiar ?
yes , i do , but i hardly think
that putting her in one of alex &apos;s hand @-@ me @-@ downs
proves anything after i pitched a fit .
well , first of all , i think it &apos;s really healthy
that you do admit it was a fit .
but if you need further proof ,
i &apos;m sure i could find a photograph over here .
sure . go ahead .
no me .
no me .
no me .
ah . there we are.christmas morning last year .
oh , my god .
oh , it &apos;s alex &apos;s old pajamas !
i &apos;m so sorry . i owe you an apology .
sometimes i can be really --
what &apos;s that ?
uh , the calendar opened to december ,
the half @-@ eaten cookies for santa claus ,
the nibbled @-@ on carrots for reindeer ? i don &apos;t know .
no , that looks like last month &apos;s vanity fair .
oh , well , you know , every month &apos;s &quot; young hollywood . &quot;
mm , and didn &apos;t lily just lose that tooth ?
nope , it &apos;s still there . it &apos;s just dirty .
christmas @-@ morning chocolates .
uh , and i am quite sure that &apos;s a reflection of mitchell
in the clothes he was wearing this morning .
oh , yay , i finally made it into a picture .
just couldn &apos;t change , could you ?
you are a snob .
okay , you know what ...
you &apos;re a snob .
... it hardly takes a snob to recognize
the clothes you put your children in ...
snob !
are uninspired at best .
claire , cam , enough !
oh , really ? !
everybody in this family has good taste .
it &apos;s just different .
it &apos;s causing too many fights .
that &apos;s why today i just put everybody
in a simple t @-@ shirt @-@ and @-@ jeans outfit .
mm . there &apos;s a new rule from now on --
nobody gives clothes to anyone else &apos;s children .
well , i think that &apos;s probably for the best .
thank god i don &apos;t have to spend one more of joe &apos;s birthdays
with a funny smile on my face .
thank you , cam . he loves it .
twinsies !
okay , everybody , it &apos;s picture time .
where &apos;s luke ?
right here .
honey , what are you wearing ? is that a girl &apos;s shirt ?
i guess i grabbed the wrong one from the laundromat .
if i &apos;m being honest , i don &apos;t hate the way it fits .
it must be that guy &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s shirt .
is it bad that that makes him
more interesting to me ?
yes . stay away .
don &apos;t worry about luke . we &apos;ll stick him in the back row .
not everyone can look their best in the picture .
joe &apos;s ready .
what did you do to him ?
you want him to look more colombian .
what &apos;s more colombian than the colombian flag ?
he &apos;s perfect .
not a banner day for my male heirs .
claire , you &apos;re in the back .
phil , you &apos;re behind claire . no rabbit ears .
i don &apos;t want you messing around behind claire &apos;s back .
cameron , lily , come on in .
it &apos;s picture time .
honey .
there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
uh , you know how you can treasure
special moments in your past
that in no way diminish the special moments in your present ?
yeah , sweetheart , it &apos;s called having a memory .
okay , i wouldn &apos;t mind a friendlier tone as i move through this .
what did you do ?
up , up , up , up , ah !
no , that &apos;s the wrong way , sweetheart .
what fell out of lily &apos;s pocket ?
is that a diamond ring ?
huh . that &apos;ll go great with your shirt .
it looks real .
it is real .
a small occlusion , but very good color .
this is claire &apos;s .
no .
claire &apos;s got her &apos;s on .
ay , phil , please , you cannot tell the difference
between this beautiful , but a small , diamond
and that chunk of glass
that should have made her finger fall off weeks ago .
i feel like i am getting you in trouble .
picture time !
what &apos;s happening ?
okay , don &apos;t be mad .
um , i lost my real ring a few months ago ,
and i just realized it must have fallen
in the box of clothes i gave to lily .
why &apos;d you take it off ?
well , i got pulled over ,
and i wanted to flirt my way out of the ticket
by pretending i was single
and it worked , and i kind of liked it .
and then i felt so guilty about liking it
that i just wanted to erase the whole thing .
so you lied ?
yes . i lied . i &apos;m sorry .
does that make me a terrible person ?
no , no . are you kidding me ?
we &apos;ve been married for a long time .
of course we &apos;re gonna have our little secrets .
the important thing ...
... is that we know the difference
between a harmless indulgence ...
and a real indiscreet--
gloria ?
left .
thank you .
okay , it &apos;s picture time !
everybody , hury up .
get in your positions .
all right ?
all right , i think that everyone is here .
okay , ready ?
and smile !
are you kidding me ?
nobody noticed i wasn &apos;t here .
what does it take with you people ? !
ay , joe , my baby , are you okay ?
yeah , yeah , maybe -- maybe that -- that &apos;s what it takes
for you to pay attention to me --
throw a temper tantrum like -- like joe .
i could just throw a big ... temper tantrum that --
or if i make a mess of everything and ...
i feel like that was aimed at me .
you want to talk about it ?
or i could just play some piano .
so i &apos;m in the ballpark .
look .
if it seems sometimes like we don &apos;t notice you ,
maybe that is because we are focused ...
... on our own stupid problems ,
and you &apos;re so steady .
oh , you mean boring .
no .
yeah .
calm .
because you live your life
the way you want to .
in fact , you inspired me recently .
oh , how so ?
fine .
i &apos;ve been going through this thing lately .
it all started when i noticed
a group of guys in the corner in the park .
and , uh , honestly , when i first found out what they were doing ,
i thought it was kind of weird ,
but i found i kept thinking about it .
and i thought i &apos;d give it a whirl .
ok-- okay . go on .
i think you know where i &apos;m going with this ,
but one of the older guys showed me the ropes .
next thing i know ,
i &apos;m hanging out at that park in that corner every day
and loving it .
but i must have also got some shame about it
because it feels good
when i &apos;m doing it , but ...
is that me now ?
a guy with a show dog .
there it is !
okay , see , i @-@ i knew what it wasn &apos;t .
i just wasn &apos;t sure what it was .
in fact , there &apos;s a show right now ,
but ... ah , i &apos;m not gonna go .
no , no . d--
i could tell this is important to you .
no .
you -- you should go . you should go .
i don &apos;t want to sneak out ,
and i don &apos;t want people to know about it .
dad .
a wise man once told me ,
&quot; i don &apos;t get it ,
but if that &apos;s who you are ,
don &apos;t you dare be ashamed of it . &quot;
i did handle that kind of well .
yeah , yeah , well ...
and it wasn &apos;t easy .
i just never pictured my kid a lawyer .
it &apos;s scary to let people see the real you ,
even when those people are your own family .
but aren &apos;t they the ones we should be least worried about ,
the ones who will love us without judging ,
who forgive our faults
and celebrate our imperfections ?
maybe even encourage us
to let our true selves shine through ?
wait , wait . hang on . wait , wait .
okay .
i think you look beautiful .
i look old .
all my cousins are going to see this .
click the button that makes my wrinkles go away .
what happened ?
nothing .
it &apos;s not nothing . you &apos;re limping !
were you trying to do the russian dance again ?
it was just something stupid i was trying out ,
and i don &apos;t even know why ,
since it &apos;s basically impossible .
gloria . gloria ! check it out .
is this not the cutest thing you &apos;ve ever seen ?
she did that on her first try .
he loves it , too .
oh , oh , sure . rub it in , joe .
attagirl !
here she comes this way !
now she is just showing off .
