I just heard you turned down a client
whose investment firm is worth $2 billion.
Well, I don't give a shit how much they're worth.
I'm not representing William Sutter.
I didn't kill anyone.
I've been saying it for 12 years,
and I can prove it.
Do you want to take a chance on each other or not?
I just got a visit from Sean Cahill.
It turns out there's a way he can get you out.
What's the catch?
He needs you to inform on your cellmate.
Tell me the truth.
He said no.
But Sean, I'm telling you, he'll come around.
Do you know how many strings I pulled
to put this thing in motion?
You're gonna get me out of here like you promised.
I never promised--
Six weeks, brother,
and if I find out you're screwing me,
you better hole up in some dark corner of this prison.
How would you feel about renovating my summer house
in the Hamptons?
Are you sure?
I've never been as sure of anything in my entire life.
The whole time, you were always gonna bring him here.
Because this is the way to get it done.
Then why didn't you tell me that in the first place?
Because it would've ended up with you wanting to use Rachel.
It ended there anyway. Now get the hell out of my way.
Harvey!
I told Rachel everything.
I'm taking the deal.
All right, let's talk specifically about what you need.
What I need is a conviction.
Obviously, but what exactly does that look like from my side?
It looks like a smoking gun,
'cause I've been after Sutter for three years now.
This guy's one slippery son of a bitch.
Wait a second. William Sutter?
Are you kidding me?
Harvey, what's going on?
He came to me a week ago to take him on, and I said no.
Well, it's a good thing you did.
No, it isn't.
What are you talking about?
When Kevin finds out I told his father-in-law
to drop dead, he's never gonna trust Mike.
If you're saying what I think you're saying,
you're not taking this man as your client.
Yes, I am, because if I don't,
we might as well not even be doing this.
Then let's not do it.
Look where we are, Sean.
We're in a car, sneaking Mike into prison.
You pulled every string you have to make this happen.
You're gonna pull out now?
I am, 'cause I'm not gonna put myself
in position to collude with you.
I won't put you in that position.
I'm in that position right now.
No, you're not.
He isn't even representing anybody yet.
This conversation is completely hypothetical.
I don't need legal advice from the convict,
and I don't need to lose my career
because you tanked this guy's defense.
I'm not tanking anything.
I'm gonna kick ass for him up and down the block,
and there's no law against me rooting for Mike
while I'm doing that.
Okay, but you cross one line that puts me in jeopardy,
I'm gonna pull the plug on this whole thing.
Well, Mike better get us what we need
before I have to do that.
Hello?
Rachel. Professor Dunbar.
What is it?
I know how passionate
you were about Leonard Bailey,
but I just heard back from the Innocence Project,
and...I'm afraid his case doesn't qualify.
What do you mean it doesn't qualify?
We have three different grounds for an appeal.
And, unfortunately, none of them revolve
around the existence of previously undiscovered DNA.
What does that have to do with it?
The man was railroaded.
He deserves to have his case retried.
It has everything to do with it,
because in a case like this,
that's the primary determinant
for whether it qualifies or not.
I don't care whether it qualifies or not.
I promised Leonard Bailey that I'd fight for him.
Well, you shouldn't have done that.
Professor, I know that we're not supposed
to become emotionally invested in our clients,
but if we don't have any passion,
then what's the point
of trying to help them in the first place?
Rachel, I understand this is a difficult thing to hear,
but there's nothing I can do.
Look, I give you my word.
We'll find you a new case.
Mike, is that you?
Yeah, yeah.
Go back to sleep. I'll talk to you in the morning.
How are you? You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
What was it?
Whatever it was,
they can't find a trace of it.
Officially, it's food poisoning.
Well, I finally got the chance to meet your buddy Harvey.
Harvey was here?
Mm-hmm, in this very cell.
You're kidding me.
I shit you not.
You should've seen him.
Thought he was gonna attack Gallo right then and there.
What stopped him?
Guards.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah.
I just need to get some sleep.
Well, it's good to have you back, buddy.
Once you get used to having someone around you can trust,
it's hard to go back.
Whatever it is you're doing, I want you to drop it
and help me buy a house in the Hamptons.
Excuse me?
I said I need a large,
expensive home in the Hamptons, preferably on the water.
Louis, I don't mean to be your business manager,
but why are you buying a vacation home
when the firm's just getting back on its feet?
Because I told Tara Messer that I have a property out there,
and I hired her to remodel it for me.
Okay, let me get this straight.
You want to spend a fortune buying a home
so that you can spend another fortune remodeling it?
It's the only logical way that I can spend time with her.
Is it?
Yes.
What other way could there possibly be?
You could just ask her out.
Well, I'm not gonna do that.
Why not?
Because I'm not.
Louis.
Jesus Christ, why are you trying
to sabotage my relationship?
You have no relationship.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I have no relationship.
I'm all alone.
Ever since Sheila rejected me,
I never thought I would find love again,
but there is something-- I don't know.
There's just something about this woman.
I feel like this may be my last shot.
I get that, Louis, and if you ask her out,
she is going to see a kind,
intelligent man that any woman
would be lucky to be in a relationship with.
But if you do it this way, and she finds out,
then you lose that shot,
because she's never gonna trust you again.
Look at me, Donna.
A woman like that...
Please.
I need her to get to know me first.
All right, Louis.
I'll help you find a house.
Looking at my pictures again?
Sorry.
What's going on?
Nothing. I was just...
I was just thinking about when I asked you
what you were in for. We got interrupted.
You never told me.
Oh, well, just as well,
'cause I don't want to talk about it.
Okay, why not?
Why not?
'Cause if I wanted to talk about it,
I'd be talking about it.
Look, I understand that we're not
supposed to talk about that stuff,
but when you think you might've been poisoned by somebody,
it makes you want to know something about the guy
you're sharing a cell with.
You saying you don't trust me, Mike?
Kevin, I'm serious.
I've told you pretty much everything about me,
and besides the fact that you don't want your kids to visit,
I don't know anything about you.
Look, Mike, there's a lot of things
that I'm ready to tell you.
I'm just not ready to tell you that.
Okay?
Mr. Specter, you don't have an appointment.
It's okay, Julie.
Someone calls me a piece of shit to my face,
I want to know what the encore is.
You here to piss on my floor?
I'm here to tell you that I'm taking your case after all.
Who says I didn't hire someone else
the second you turned me down?
I do, because you didn't pick my name out of a phone book.
You came to me because you found out
that your guy's in prison with my guy.
So what if I did?
Cut the shit, William.
Your son-in-law saved Mike from a guy I put behind bars.
That means I owe you, and you didn't tell me about it
because you knew I'd find out
and come crawling back on my own.
You're hardly crawling.
I didn't as a baby,
and I'm not gonna start now.
This is the best you're gonna get.
So are we doing this thing together or not?
Okay. You got me, Harvey.
Now what?
Now I go see your son-in-law.
Why the hell would you want to do that?
Because he's in prison, and you're facing an indictment,
which makes him the biggest vulnerability you have.
You have a call from Danbury Federal Prison.
Do you accept the charges?
Yes.
Harvey, we have a problem.
What is it?
I tried to talk to Kevin.
I got nothing.
Well, what do you want me to do about it?
I don't know. It would help
if I had something to talk about other than,
"Hey, what exactly are you in here for?"
Okay, Mike, you want something to talk about?
I'll get you something to talk about.
Well, if it isn't my knight in beautiful armor.
How are you, Mr. Bailey?
Please, call me Leonard.
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Leonard.
The Innocence Project looked over the new evidence, and...
they decided not to take your case.
What does that mean?
It means there's nothing else I can do.
I knew you couldn't do shit for me.
No, no, no. You don't understand.
They almost never take cases without new DNA evidence,
and yours had none.
I don't care about that.
You asked me to take a chance on you,
and now you march in here and tell me you're giving up?
No, no, Mr. Bailey--
You said you would fight for me.
I did fight for you.
Well, then fight goddamn harder!
I'm sorry,
and I understand how you feel,
but there's just nothing more that I can do.
How do you know what I feel?
You don't know what it's like to be kept away
from your loved ones.
Actually, I do.
How's that?
My fianc√©'s in prison.
How long?
Two years.
Two years is nothing.
It doesn't feel like nothing to me.
What if it was forever, Rachel?
Would you give up on him like you did me?
I didn't give up on you.
You said you found compelling evidence.
I also said that it wasn't enough.
That sounds like giving up to me.
Harvey, what are you doing here?
I'm here to give you official notice.
I'm now William Sutter's attorney.
Congratulations. I hope you know what you're doing.
I do, because I'm also here to notify you that
unless you bring an indictment in the next 48 hours,
I'm gonna sue you and the SEC for harassing my client.
What the hell are you talking about?
You heard me. You've been digging
into his accounts, hounding his employees,
and questioning his investors.
He's under investigation for insider trading.
That's how it works.
Well, if that's how it works, then bring on an indictment.
Ah, I see what you're doing.
Mike can't get Kevin to talk without me bringing an action.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, well, it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm not
bringing an indictment without knowing
that I can win at trial.
And you're never gonna win at trial
if you don't shake the trees and see what falls.
Damn it, Harvey, I am not colluding on this,
and you're in here trying to get me
to bring an indictment against your own client.
Because when you bring that indictment,
I'm gonna beat it, and if you don't bring it
and continue investigating my client,
I'm gonna sue you, which is exactly
what I'd be doing no matter who he was.
You know what, Harvey? You want me to bring an action?
You got one.
Jesus Christ, there you are.
What's going on with the house hunt?
I am on top of it, Louis.
Well, it doesn't look like you're on top of it.
It looks like you're drinking a goddamn cup of coffee.
Maybe that's because I was on the Internet all night
trying to find houses for you because I knew
that nothing would ever meet your insane specifications.
Is that true?
Not one word.
Goddamn it, Donna, this is important.
Right now there are hundreds of men out there
with beach houses,
and Tara could be meeting any one of them.
Right now I wish I was meeting any one of them.
Donna, I thought you understood this isn't a joke.
I know it isn't, Louis,
and that's why I haven't sent you anything I've seen so far,
because I haven't found the right thing yet.
And what if I said I lost confidence in your ability
to know what I'm looking for in any given situation?
Then I would say that that is exactly
why I've been avoiding you,
and if you had any self-awareness at all,
you would stop bothering me and instead trust me for once.
Well, we both know that's never gonna happen.
Well, then, why don't you go find your own house, Louis?
Gin.
Again?
How many times do I have to tell you?
Don't play cards with a guy with a photographic memory.
How many times I have to tell you I'm still gonna beat you?
Deal.
Sorry to interrupt your Go Fish.
There's a Harvey Specter here to see you.
Saved by the bell.
Not you, Ross. Miller.
Mind if I ask why you're here to see me instead of Mike?
Because I heard he's okay,
and I'm not just Mike's attorney anymore.
I'm yours.
I don't need your help with Gallo.
I'm not talking about Gallo.
William Sutter came to me to represent him.
I turned him down until I found out that his son-in-law
is the one who's been watching Mike's back.
Well, I appreciate that,
but what does that have to do with me?
I don't make it a habit of representing people I can't trust.
You saying you can't trust me?
I'm saying the SEC thinks William's firm,
the one that you worked for,
is breaking the law.
So I need to know right now,
when they come at you, what are you gonna say?
I'm gonna say the same thing I did
when they came at me the last time.
My father-in-law's innocent.
Is that it or can I go?
One more thing, Kevin.
An indictment's coming down any second,
and once it does,
that makes you every single inmate's ticket out of here.
So if you ever have a doubt about William's innocence,
keep it to your goddamn self.
Kevin, talk to you for a second?
Yeah, sure. What's going on, George?
It's about your roommate.
What about him?
You got some nerve playing cards here
while my life is wasting away.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about that motion
you were supposed to file for me.
Then you better get your facts straight,
because I did file it.
Yeah, and it got bounced right back.
What? No, that's not possible.
It is possible.
While you were taking your little siesta in the infirmary,
I got an email that said
the damn thing wasn't even filed right.
Oh, goddamn it.
Looks like you can't keep your promises.
No, I can keep it.
This is just some procedural mix-up, all right?
But I'm gonna need to use your phone.
Are you kidding me?
I'm telling you that I can have this thing taken care of.
I just need to make a phone call.
What's wrong with the goddamn phones in here?
Nothing, but I already used it today,
which means I can't use it for another two days.
So unless you want to waste that time playing cards with me,
which I guarantee you'll lose,
you'll give me your phone right now.
I like you. You got balls.
You know what? So do I,
which is why I can take this out
in front of any guard in here
and know I'm not getting in any trouble.
Don't forget that, and get that shit handled.
Harvey, I have something for you.
What is it?
It's from Sean Cahill,
and I need you to take a look at it right away.
Why? I know what an indictment looks like.
It's not an indictment, Harvey.
He's suspending William Sutter's trading license.
Get Cahill on the phone.
Sir, I have Harvey Specter on the line.
You've got to be shitting me.
Harvey, what can I do for you?
You can explain to me what the hell you're up to,
suspending my client's trading license.
You wanted to get the ball rolling.
This gets the ball rolling.
This isn't what I wanted.
And I don't take orders from you.
And I'm not gonna be able to stop this in court,
which means Sutter's gonna fire me.
Then maybe you didn't understand my initial position.
I don't give a shit if you get fired or not.
You thought that you needed to represent Sutter,
so you went ahead and did what you needed to do.
I thought I didn't want to bring an indictment
before I had enough to win,
so I did what I needed to do,
but what I need to do right now
is finish this delicious ham sandwich,
which means the next time that I talk to you,
I expect it to be in court.
What's going on?
What do you mean, what's going on?
I mean, we're playing cards,
and Harvey's here to see you,
and then next thing I know,
you're giving me some death stare,
and you come out here.
Nothing's going on.
Well, what did Harvey want?
He's representing my father-in-law,
which means now he's also representing me.
That good enough for you?
All right, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
I'm on your side.
Are you?
'Cause Harvey said I shouldn't trust anyone in here,
and as far as I'm concerned, that includes you.
What? that doesn't make any sense.
You know what doesn't make any sense?
One minute Gallo is your enemy,
and the next minute,
he's handing you his cell phone like he's your best friend.
I'm trying to help him get out of here,
which is good for both of us.
Is that what you were doing last night outside of prison?
You were helping him get out?
Is that what was going on?
Kevin, come on.
I was worried about you, cellmate.
I thought you were in real trouble,
but they wouldn't let me see you,
so I asked a friend of mine
who works in the infirmary to check on you,
and ten minutes ago he told me that he's pretty damn sure
you were gone for at least three hours.
Well, what do you have to say about that?
I was gone because I was in the hospital.
That's the first I'm hearing about it.
Yeah, and why would I tell you that?
Why wouldn't you?
Something's going on here, and I can tell.
All right, Kevin. You want to know what happened?
I went to the hospital because harvey paid the doctor
because he didn't trust that
I would make it through the night in here,
and I didn't tell you
because I didn't want to put you in a position
where you'd have to lie for me.
You know what?
That sounds like a whole lot of bullshit to me.
Yeah, you know what, Kevin?
I think it's pretty goddamn funny that you don't trust me
when you're the one that won't even tell me
what you're in here for.
No. No. No.
Shit, no.
No. No. No.
Not now, Harvey.
I'm in the middle of something important.
Whatever it is, it's not as important as this.
What is this?
It's notice to suspend William Sutter's trading license.
The question is, what can be done about it?
Nothing can be done about it.
What do you mean, nothing can be done about it?
You're supposed to be the financial wizard.
I am, and I'm telling you
that this kind of thing is at the SEC's discretion.
They have unlimited power
to suspend trading licenses up to 90 days.
Goddamn it.
It's only 90 days.
90 days gets me fired.
Well, it's gonna be okay, Harvey.
I mean, I know things have been rough around here,
but business is picking up.
This isn't about business, Louis.
It's about Mike.
What are you not telling me, Harvey?
I'm not gonna tell you the details,
because I'm not gonna put you at risk,
but I have a chance to get Mike out early,
and if I lose this motion, it's over.
Well, then I'll figure out a way to get it done.
Thank you, Louis.
This is Harvey Specter.
Harvey, it's me.
Mike, what the hell are you doing with a private phone?
What the hell are you doing representing Kevin?
You were the one having trouble getting him to open up.
And you thought telling him not to trust anyone in here
was the answer to that?
Look, I did that to get him to trust me,
because if he trusts me, he trusts you.
Yeah, well, you didn't count on one thing.
He knows I wasn't in the infirmary the whole night.
What? How the hell does he know that?
Some guy he knows works there.
I told him some story about you taking me to the hospital,
but he's not buying it.
Then you figure out a way to make him buy it.
Fine, I'll think of something,
but that's not my only problem.
What now?
Gallo's filing came back.
It needs to be filed in person
and it needs to be filed by his attorney of record.
You got to be shitting me.
You want me to represent that animal?
If you don't, then getting Kevin to talk
is gonna be the least of my problems.
Rachel, I need your help with something.
What can I do?
I need you to draft a parole application for Frank Gallo.
I thought Mike was doing that.
There was a problem,
which is also why i need you to draw up an engagement letter
for me to be Gallo's attorney.
Done.
What is it?
I heard you get upset with Louis earlier,
and now you're coming to me about Gallo.
So...I just need to know if you think
this whole Cahill thing's really gonna work.
Rachel--
Harvey, just tell me the truth.
Look, I don't know if it's gonna work or not,
but I do know I'm not gonna stop trying.
Got to say, you don't look so bad for a guy
who blacked out in the yard the other day.
Yeah, they took good care of me.
Well, I'm glad you're okay.
What's on your mind?
I need you to get a message to the warden for me.
Sure.
I'll bring it to him at our weekly brunch.
What would you like for it to say?
I'm serious.
I don't care what you are.
You want to get a message to the warden,
you go through the proper channels
and get it to him yourself.
I can't go through the proper channels,
because nobody can know about it.
All right, Mike, tell me what's going on.
I made a deal to get out of here early.
What kind of deal?
The kind where I inform on someone.
Someone?
Kevin Miller.
Mike, come on.
Julius, let me explain.
I don't need you to explain.
You are betraying your cellmate, who you came to me to protect.
No, what I am doing is putting away someone
who is out there doing worse things than I ever did.
So I don't need your judgment. I need your help.
I'm sorry, it's not my job to help you do something like this.
No, it's your job to help me prepare for life after prison.
Well, this is gonna make life after prison
come a hell of a lot faster.
Well, fine, you want to do this?
You go ahead and do it, but I am not gonna be complicit.
You know what? You talk a big goddamn game about trusting you,
but what does that trust mean?
Now, I need to get to the warden,
and I need to do it without the guards finding out.
Can you help me or not?
Rachel, what are you doing here so late?
Professor, do you have a minute?
Of course. Yeah, sit down.
I went to see Leonard Bailey this morning
to tell him we were turning our backs on him.
No one's turning their back on him, Rachel.
There are just better cases.
No offense, but that's bullshit.
Excuse me?
You read his file.
There's enough evidence in there for him to get a new trial,
and instead we're gonna let him rot on death row.
Rachel, I understand how you feel,
but there are some things that--
I feel like
I dropped your class to take this case.
And I told you I'd get you another one.
I don't want another one. I want this one.
Rachel, I cannot provide you
with the resources and the backing anymore.
Okay, so what if I were able to provide my own resources
and--and to get the supervision of a qualified lawyer?
What are you talking about?
I work at Pearson Specter Litt, Professor.
They've been known to take a pro bono case
from time to time.
Okay.
Okay, you win, Rachel, but this is highly irregular.
I don't care.
That's not a good enough reason
to turn our backs on Leonard Bailey.
Well, don't ever question my financial wizardry again.
Let's have it.
I was banging my head against the wall,
trying to figure out a way to stop the suspension,
but then it dawned on me.
We don't need to stop it.
If we can turn Sutter's firm into the subsidiary
of a separate holding company,
we can find someone else to execute the trades for him.
Beautiful.
Yeah, but the only issue is,
we need to find traders that are willing
to bankroll the son of a bitch,
given his reputation.
Well, that's not gonna be a problem.
No, Harvey, this is not nothing.
Nobody wants to work with this guy.
You're forgetting our new friends across the hall.
What? What, are you kidding me?
You think that asshole's gonna say yes to me?
It's okay. I know who he'll say yes to.
Harvey,
I know how tough it's been not having Mike here,
and I just want to let you know that I miss him too.
I appreciate that, Louis, but you didn't have to say it,
because actions speak louder than words,
and you doing this says it all.
Harvey, I've been looking for you all day.
Well, here I am.
Then maybe you can tell me why all of a sudden
we're representing William Sutter.
I changed my mind.
You changed your mind?
You told me taking Sutter on would be like selling your soul,
and now you're doing a complete 180.
Jessica, I--
No, Harvey,
I'm not saying I don't like it.
I just want to know what's going on.
Sutter's the one Cahill's after.
You've got to be kidding me.
I shit you not.
well, I get it.
You give him a full-throttle defense,
gain his trust,
and hope to God Mike cuts his legs out.
Exactly.
What?
Is he gonna give us his investment business?
Not until after we win.
Which we're hoping we don't.
Jessica, I have to do this.
Harvey, relax.
I'm on board. It pays the bills,
and we can leverage it into more business anyway,
but we'd better leverage it fast,
because losing this case might be good for Mike,
but it's not gonna be good for us,
and I don't know about you,
but I'd like to get back on top.
There's nothing I'd like more,
which is why I came in here.
What do you need?
I need you to get something from those traders.
On your feet, Ross. You're going to solitary.
What? Wait, what are you talking about?
You heard me. 24 hours, let's go.
No, I'm not going anywhere with you
until you tell me what's going on.
You'll go where I tell you to,
or you'll get acquainted with this.
Listen to me. I just want to know why--
Next question makes it 48 hours.
You coming or not?
What did you do?
Jessica--good, I caught you.
Rachel, what is it?
Do you remember my Innocence Project case?
How could I not? Badass Rachel.
Well, thank you. So I took it,
but now they're saying that it doesn't qualify.
Let me guess.
You want us to take it on as a pro bono.
All I need is one hour a week of supervision,
and if I need to appear in court, you come with me.
I know that that's a lot to ask, but--
Rachel, I wish I could tell you I had an extra hour to give,
but I don't.
Jessica, please.
If you would just come with me and meet this man--
No, this is my point.
I just found out we have less time than I thought we did
to get this firm back on its feet,
and I can't afford to spend one minute on anything else.
But, I mean, really--
Rachel, I'm sorry.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Thank you.
Thank your counselor, Mr. Rowe.
I will.
You must trust him a lot
to let him in on your little arrangement.
I do.
He helped me, even though he doesn't approve of this.
Sounds like you don't either.
It's not up to me to approve or not.
Is that what you came down here to tell me?
No, I came down here to tell you I've been doing this
a long time,
and I've seen a lot of inmates come and go.
These kind of deals, they don't always work out so well.
You saying you think I'll be here for the whole two years?
I'm saying I hope it doesn't turn out even worse than that.
I thought the markets were closed.
Did you ever see "Wall Street
Money never sleeps"?
What's this?
Have a look.
Let me get this straight. I hire you,
and the first thing you do is come to me for a favor?
I came to you for a favor when you were my tenant.
Now, as your lawyer, I am coming to you with an opportunity.
What are you talking about?
That's not a charitable donation.
You do this, you'll get paid for it.
How much?
Enough.
How do I know I'm not leaving something on the table?
Because I never leave anything on the table.
All right.
You know, I don't get it.
You're obviously a big-time attorney,
and now you're subletting to me.
What the hell happened here?
You don't know?
Why would I?
Google it.
That bad?
We hired a lawyer.
Turns out he was a fraud. It ruined our reputation.
Turned out to be a fraud, or you knew he was a fraud?
Good night, Stu. See you in the morning.
Warden, what are you-- what are you doing?
Did you know Mike Ross
left the prison grounds the other night?
What?
Don't bullshit me.
Did you know his lawyer, who I understand is now also your lawyer,
paid someone to get him out of here?
I don't know anything about it.
I suppose if I asked you
who he paid, you'd have the same answer.
I find out you're lying, next time,
you are gonna be the one in solitary,
and it won't be just one night.
What?
I'm just thinking about
when this asshole finds out
you're gonna blow his bullshit suspension out of the water.
William, I am gonna blow it out of the water,
but I'm gonna need you to sign this first.
What the hell is Stevens Investment Group?
It's the company you're trading through from now on.
Bullshit. They own me?
They don't own anything.
They control you on paper,
and unless you want to shut down for the next 90 days,
this is what you have to do.
Well, bullshit.
What are you gonna do if that guy indicts me,
cut a deal where I plead guilty, and I get probation?
'Cause if this is what you consider winning,
I might as well find myself another lawyer.
Okay, gentlemen, I'm ready to hear arguments,
but I have to tell you,
unless Congress passed a new law last night,
this suspension stands.
That's okay, Your Honor.
My client's firm is now
the subsidiary of a holding company
with a different trading license.
What?
It's all right here.
In that case,
I move to have that company's license suspended.
And that, right there, is why I'd like to ask the court
to have Mr. Cahill removed
from any investigation
regarding my client in the future.
Are you out of your mind?
We have an antagonistic history, Your Honor.
Everyone knows it, and this action
is nothing more than a stunt
designed to punish me through my client.
This is ridiculous.
I've been investigating William Sutter for 18 months.
And in the last 18 months,
he took no action,
and then yesterday, when I informed him
I am Mr. Sutter's attorney,
within five hours he suspends his license,
and now he's trying to do it again.
That's what I call a win.
Mr. Cahill, this doesn't look good.
I'm inclined to take you off this case.
Your Honor, Mr. Specter is right.
We have history, but I've been involved
in this case a lot longer than he has.
So if anyone has to be thrown out for a conflict,
it is him, not me.
I'm not going anywhere, Your Honor.
Then let Mr. Sutter waive
any claims to conflict altogether,
unless, of course, you want to set a precedent
that any time a defendant doesn't like his prosecutor,
all he has to do is hire a lawyer
he's gone up against before.
Mr. Sutter, would you like to keep your attorney
or hire another one, because I am not
taking Mr. Cahill off this case.
Harvey's my guy, Your Honor.
Then unless there's some other issue,
the court has a full docket.
Guard tells you you have a visitor,
doesn't say who it is, you start thinking
maybe Angelina Jolie opened your letters after all.
Sit down, Gallo.
You here to make more false accusations?
I'm here to tell you that, as of this minute,
I'm your new attorney.
Come again?
You need someone to file that motion.
I'm that someone.
What if I don't want your help?
Well, then you can rot in here for the rest of your sentence.
It's actually kind of funny, isn't it,
you fighting to get me out
when you fought so hard to put me away.
Must kill you.
Makes me sick to my stomach,
but I'm gonna live with it,
because you're gonna give me something in return.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
Until this thing goes through,
not only are you gonna keep your hands off Mike,
you're gonna be his personal protector in here.
Bullshit.
Not bullshit.
He so much as twists an ankle in the yard,
I'll withdraw that motion.
Now, aren't you forgetting a little something, champ?
I don't need you to handle this thing for me.
Now that I know what's what, I'll get my own attorney.
Yeah, you do that, and I'll tell the courts
that you just admitted to me that you tried to poison Mike.
You know how much time that's gonna add to your sentence?
I didn't do shit to him!
Good for you.
Who do you think they're gonna believe,
a former prosecutor like me
or an informant convict like you?
Of course, if I'm your attorney,
I can't tell them any of that.
You son of a bitch.
You set me up.
I sure as hell did.
So it's up to you.
You in or you out?
Can I talk to you a second?
What is it, Louis?
I can't find a house.
A house? What house?
I don't know anything about a house,
certainly not for a person
who doesn't have any confidence in my ability
to know what he's looking for in a given situation.
Donna, please, can't we just pretend that I didn't say
what I said, like we usually do?
No, Louis, we can't, because I need to know
that you have spent at least one second contemplating
what your little outburst was about.
I know what it was about.
Really? What is that?
I miss you, Donna.
I miss having you as my secretary.
I miss you too, Louis.
And don't get me wrong.
I'm not saying Gretchen's not great.
Who would?
It's just--I'm just saying she's not you.
Who is?
Nobody.
Was this the kind of thing you're looking for?
Oh, my God, it's perfect. Is it still available?
An offer went in this morning.
We have to beat it.
No, Louis, we don't.
That offer was yours.
Did they take it?
We find out tomorrow.
Donna--
No.
I'm sorry about what happened with the warden.
Yeah.
If you need anything--
I'll let you know.
Look, I didn't-- I didn't tell them
what you told me about Harvey getting you out.
I need you to know that. It's important to me.
Yeah, whatever you say, Kevin.
I know I haven't told you why I'm in here, Mike...
But you don't understand.
From the second I got here, I've had to watch
what I say, every single word,
and every morning I get up,
and I remind myself
not to say the wrong thing to the wrong person,
and every night I go to bed and think,
"Another day down where I didn't."
Yeah, you think I don't know what that's like?
I've been living a lie every day for years.
Yeah, but you were just protecting yourself.
You don't have a family.
Kevin, what did you do?
I got in a fight with my wife.
It was...
it was bad.
We said things to each other we never said before.
I went out.
I got drunk.
I got into my car,
and I almost killed someone.
Next thing I knew, I woke up in an ambulance,
looking up at a police officer.
What?
I made one stupid,
stupid mistake.
And it's gonna cost me three years with my family,
and it's not just the special things, man.
I'm missing a thousand chances
to hug my kids in the morning...
and kiss my wife good night,
all because I couldn't control myself.
What were you fighting with your wife about?
What do you mean, you were trying to protect your family?
Kevin.
I--yeah, I can't.
I just can't.
Okay.
I'll do it.
Excuse me?
Your pro bono.
Bring me the file tomorrow morning.
Jessica, I'm sorry. Can I just ask why?
What does it matter?
It matters to me.
I've been out all day,
trying to drum up business, and it hasn't been easy.
So from now on, when people Google our name,
I'd rather they see,
"Innocent man freed by Pearson Specter"
than "Manhattan law firm hires a fraud."
Thank you.
Good night, Rachel.
What are you doing here, Sean
Oh, you know what I'm doing here.
What were you thinking, trying to get me thrown off my own case?
He was coming at me. I had to do something to keep his trust.
Well, for your information,
if I get thrown off this case,
that deal that you don't know about
getting that certain someone out early doesn't exist anymore.
You think I don't know that?
No, I don't think you do,
because if I hadn't pulled that shit out of my ass,
this whole thing would've been for nothing.
What are you so pleased with yourself about?
Nothing. It's just...
you want me to take this case,
and now you're getting pissed at me
because I'm too good a job defending my client.
Now that you put it that way...
It was a good fix, Sean.
It was a good move, Harvey.
Want to get a drink?
Why don't we just have one here?
This might be the last one that we have together for a long time.
Why?
As of right now, you have no action pending against my client.
But as of tomorrow, I do,
'cause those indictments are coming down in the morning.
