you know how when you were a little kid
and you believed in fairy tales ?
that fantasy of what your life would be--
white dress , prince charming ,
who &apos;d carry you away to a castle on a hill .
you &apos;d lie in bed at night and close your eyes ,
and you had complete and utter faith .
8 hours , 16 ounces of chocolate , and 32 cupcakes ,
and they still don &apos;t taste right .
no , these are good .
martha stewart would be proud .
yeah , look where it got her .
santa claus , the tooth fairy , prince charming--
they were so close , you could taste them .
there &apos;s something missing , some specific ingredient .
why can &apos;t i remember ?
but eventually you grow up .
one day you open your eyes ,
and the fairy tale disappears .
look , just call her .
call your mother and ask .
most people turn to the things and people they can trust .
i don &apos;t want to call my mother .
so , let &apos;s go sleep at your house tonight .
what ?
i mean , why are we always sleeping at my house ?
do you even have one ?
one what ?
a house .
with a closet .
with your stuff in it .
your personal stuff .
do you even have one of those ?
good morning .
hey . you guys want a cupcake ?
izzie made &apos; em .
you know , i like it here .
hey , you said so yourself-- you liked having your things around ,
sleeping in your own bed .
you &apos;re like a health nut , aren &apos;t you ?
you eat muesli every morning .
no , i don &apos;t .
okay , the muesli thing-- you do .
the last 7 days , at least .
oh , come on .
i haven &apos;t been here for a whole week ...
have i ?
see ?
even they think it &apos;s weird .
but the thing is , it &apos;s hard to let go of that fairy tale entirely .
&apos;cause almost everyone still has that smallest bit of hope-- of faith--
that one day they &apos;ll open their eyes
and it will all come true .
so , i &apos;ve checked the schedule .
i start e.n.t. on the 9th .
it &apos;s a light rotation . can you get me in then ?
oh , i &apos;m afraid not .
we have openings on the 16th .
there are other options besides termination , you know ?
adoption ...
keeping the baby .
you think it over . call me back .
i &apos;m here all ...
put me down for the 16th .
i &apos;ll confirm after i rearrange my schedule .
i know this is a difficult decision .
okay , you know the talking part ?
i &apos;m not interested .
so , devo , you just had a root canal , correct ?
yeah .
i couldn &apos;t stop bleeding after-- literally .
now i &apos;m stuck with you guys .
give me the bullet .
17 @-@ year @-@ old female hospitalized for excessive bleeding ,
status post root canal .
also had a significant new heart murmur associated with fever .
now afebrile on antibiotics .
if i &apos;m gonna die , can you page mom and dad ?
you &apos;re not dying .
where are your parents ?
in the cafeteria .
my freak father likes hospital food .
you &apos;re in excellent hands here .
dr. karev is gonna run some labs .
and i &apos;ll see you with your parents in a little while .
add a bleeding time to the coags .
so , what kind of name is &quot; devo , &quot; anyway ?
&apos;80s rocker .
my parents did too much blow .
i call myself &quot; esther . &quot;
nice skirt , esther .
what are you , amish ?
get a life . haven &apos;t you ever seen an orthodox jew ?
this guy belongs in psych . what are you doing turfing him here ?
he &apos;s my gift to you .
had a seizure two days ago and another one this morning .
what are you talking about ? it says right here ,
&quot; he talks to dead people , his family thinks he &apos;s dangerous ,
and they had him committed . &quot;
that &apos;s psych , not neuro .
didn &apos;t you go to med school ?
yes , unlike the correspondence school you attended .
oh , that would be stanford , right ?
i learned not to jump to conclusions .
sorry , ladies . we can &apos;t take him back until he &apos;s cleared .
so , you &apos;re dumping him on us ?
he thinks his seizures are visions .
hello ! they &apos;re not seizures . i &apos;m psychic .
of course you are , and i &apos;m a chicken .
hey , genius .
okay , mr. duff . we &apos;re gonna start our work @-@ up now .
work me up , work me down .
i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s a waste of time .
can you grip my fingers , please ?
cristina ...
mr. duff ?
mr. duff , are you okay ?
someone ...
someone what ?
someone &apos;s gonna check out .
bye @-@ bye .
the man-- he &apos;s nuts .
i &apos;m dizzy , not deaf , lady .
someone on the fourth floor is gonna die .
code blue , fourth floor .
code blue , fourth floor .
got a code .
right away .
get it .
fourth floor , dead guy .
the psychic predicted the fourth @-@ floor dead guy .
i need someone to cover me on the 16th . you in ?
i &apos;m thinking about letting my hair grow .
and maybe i won &apos;t shave-- go for the stubble effect .
what do you think ?
the 16th , george . can you cover me or not ?
uh , yeah . i guess . why ?
it &apos;s none of your business .
a &quot; thank you &quot; would be nice .
it &apos;s just that i hardly know anything about you .
you know i &apos;m from new york . you know i like ferry boats .
enough with the ferry boats . what about your friends ?
i &apos;m a surgeon . i don &apos;t have friends .
everybody has friends .
i mean , who do you hang out with ?
what do you do on your days off ?
these are important questions .
ah , important for who ?
we &apos;re having sex every night . i think i deserve details .
you have more details than most .
see . this is going somewhere weird .
i want facts , and until i get them , my pants are staying on .
or you could just roll with it .
be flexible . see what happens .
i &apos;m not flexible .
there i disagree .
hmm . i got to go .
we &apos;ll find these things out .
that &apos;s the fun part , you know ?
that &apos;s the gravy .
that is what i &apos;m talking about .
i don &apos;t want to be your gravy .
your daughter needs a valve replacement .
tests are indicative of von willebrand &apos;s disease ,
which explains the excessive bleeding after the root canal .
and that means ?
devo can &apos;t take the blood thinners
necessary to maintain a mechanical heart valve .
we &apos;re suggesting a porcine valve instead .
porcine ?
as in pig ?
it &apos;s the standard of care for someone in this situation .
pig , huh ?
it &apos;s the other white meat .
i don &apos;t care what you do . save my daughter &apos;s life .
i &apos;m removing the lump now .
someone said you guys have a psychic running around here . is that true ?
i did not even hear you say that .
predicted someone would die on the fourth floor .
i.c.u. &apos; s on the fourth floor . people die all the time .
okay . we &apos;re finishing up here , mrs. glass .
we &apos;ll take this down to path
and get the results of the frozen @-@ section biopsy
and see you in a few hours .
seriously , the guy is just playing mind games .
i can see further into the future than he can .
why do you even care about this , stevens ?
i don &apos;t .
okay , mr. walker . does that hurt ?
i can &apos;t feel anything until you get to my thigh .
try wiggling your toes .
are they moving ?
no .
damn .
i could about 10 minutes ago .
well , your spine x @-@ rays look clear .
you fell rock @-@ climbing ?
in snohomish .
just a small drop . i was belayed .
my wife and boys are on the way .
what &apos;s wrong with me , anyway ?
hold your legs up .
should i be scared now ?
just try and relax .
nurse , i need a stat m.r.i.
send an intern with him .
make it meredith grey .
thick , short neck .
that isn &apos;t good . it &apos;s hard to intubate .
you want me to do that ?
he &apos;s my patient . i &apos;m fine .
i just can &apos;t see anything yet . suction .
don &apos;t break any teeth .
i know that ... don &apos;t you think i know that ?
pulse ox down 87 percent .
bag him .
sure you don &apos;t want me to do that ?
no , damn it ! tube .
there .
got it .
it &apos;s in the esophagus .
don &apos;t you know an esophagus from a trachea ?
anatomy is messed up in here .
you trying to kill this patient , o &apos;malley ?
maybe we can send you to practice on mannequins .
no , it &apos;s just i haven &apos;t done this much .
but when i have , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s been good .
it &apos;s just i @-@ i haven &apos;t ...
let &apos;s review the concepts .
never take your eyes away .
always , always know you can follow through .
don &apos;t ever follow through on one of my patients , o &apos;malley .
a little botox would do wonders for all those frown lines .
ok . shut up .
you allowed to talk to me like that ?
god , you &apos;re hot ... in a mrs. livingston kind of way .
see here ?
these are spikes in your temporal lobe .
it means you have epilepsy . not visions . seizures .
you think i &apos;m epileptic ? that is so not right .
i &apos;m gonna order an mri
so i can take a closer look at your brain .
yeah , there &apos;s no way ...
mr. duff ?
mr. duff , can you see me ? can you hear me ?
stay with me .
i wouldn &apos;t have picked you for the mommy track , nurse betty .
see ?
i told you i know things .
this pregnancy thing , you can &apos;t run away from it .
dr. bailey , i want off the psychic case .
i &apos;ll take whatever you got . can i switch ?
ask nicely .
uh , well , this is me doing nicely .
look , i know the type .
these guys want everybody to think they &apos;re a sideshow .
let me take him .
i don &apos;t do switches .
i &apos;ll do your post @-@ op notes for a month .
fine . i can accept that .
izzie , you get psych guy .
yang . this is your lucky day .
you get to be with me on breast cancer .
there &apos;s spotting , so you &apos;ll need to do a pelvic .
she &apos;s pregnant .
see ? this .
the guy &apos;s films are clear .
there &apos;s no reason i can see for his creeping paralysis .
it &apos;s just so surprising .
i expected an intrusion into the spinal space
or bony spur in the nucleus pulposus .
well , you were wrong .
you don &apos;t always get what you expect , do you ?
what is your problem ?
give me something to go on .
anything . what are your grandparents &apos; names ?
i don &apos;t have them .
where &apos;d you grow up ?
your favorite flavor of ice cream ?
where &apos;d you spend your summer vacations ?
lighten up . it &apos;ll be good for your blood pressure .
oh , don &apos;t you tell me to lighten up .
i &apos;ll lighten up when i ...
... feel light .
don &apos;t we have treatment options ?
i @-@ i mean , aren &apos;t there always alternatives ?
with this stage of invasive carcinoma ,
surgery , chemo , radiation and drug therapy are your only options .
can i wait until the end of my pregnancy ?
the pregnancy hormones will likely speed the growth of the cancer .
and the baby ?
none of these treatments will allow the baby to survive .
mr. and mrs. glass , i understand how difficult this is .
no disrespect , but like hell , you do .
you &apos;re going to have to make a decision as to how you want to proceed .
you mean my baby &apos;s life or my own ?
yes .
we &apos;ll have to evacuate the fetus .
any changes , mr. walker ?
i can &apos;t move my legs at all .
he said he was moving his legs when he came in .
what &apos;s wrong with him ?
i don &apos;t know .
the paralysis is moving quickly ,
and nothing in the mri to explain it .
has tommy been under stress lately ?
you know what &apos;s making me stressed ?
being in here and not being able to move .
dr. grey .
emotional trauma can be converted
into something physical , right ?
yes . this is possible .
like hysterical numbness or paralysis .
maybe there is no physiological reason ,
and he &apos;s having a conversion reaction .
you think it &apos;s psychosomatic ?
it is not in your head , man . i believe you .
mr. duff , please .
who was that ?
psych sent him down . he has visions .
is that it ? am i crazy ?
no . no .
i &apos;m gonna order a higher @-@ level mri .
we &apos;re gonna figure this out .
you know how important this is to me !
this is about saving your life , sweetie .
you &apos;re not respecting it , or me .
you &apos;re letting them put a pig ,
a freaking non @-@ kosher , traif mammal ,
into my chest , into my heart ,
the very essence of my being !
it &apos;s a porcine valve , actually .
i don &apos;t care what it is .
if you give me a pig part , i might as well be dead .
told you , this whole orthodox thing was a mistake .
what was wrong with being reform like everyone else ?
you guys don &apos;t even light candles friday nights .
you don &apos;t know all the passover plagues .
boils , vermin , pestilence . even i know that .
miss friedman ,
i appreciate your extreme religious convictions .
fire , hail ...
simply put , without this procedure , you will die .
you &apos;re hotshot doctors . you &apos;ll come up with something else .
as long as it doesn &apos;t answer to wilbur and say &quot; oink , &quot;
i don &apos;t care what it is .
your nostrils are flaring .
they are not .
you &apos;re into me . i can tell .
dr. small and angry was a hot appetizer ,
but you , doc , are a smorgasbord of lust .
mr. duff , you &apos;re pressing your luck .
would you press it for me ?
i hope you &apos;re not claustrophobic .
you &apos;re staring at me . stop it .
i &apos;m looking at you , sweetheart , but it &apos;s the strangest thing .
i &apos;m hungry for a chocolate cupcake .
what did you say ?
a chocolate cupcake .
one of those fudgey things
with the white squiggle on the frosting .
could you oblige ?
what , do i still have some chocolate
on my face or in my hair or something ?
what are you talking about ?
you .
i know the drill , so keep it up .
next you &apos;ll be reading my cards ,
telling me my dead uncle is in the room .
is he ?
i don &apos;t have a dead uncle .
i &apos;m watching you .
if that &apos;s turkey , can i have some ?
it &apos;s soggy .
it &apos;ll kill you . solve everything .
i could have got that intubation . i am good at intubations .
why does everything in a hospital smell like a hospital ?
don &apos;t be so hard on yourself , george . everybody makes mistakes .
i &apos;m good at a lot of things .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna tell you something , george .
you need to get laid .
see that nurse over there ?
she &apos;s single . she &apos;s got red hair . go ask her out .
in case you forgot , i intubated an esophagus .
dude , you &apos;re tweaking .
maybe you should go see that psychic .
mr. duff is not a psychic !
i am trying to help you .
go buy her a latte and freshen up your gonad , please .
shut up .
it &apos;s not too late to call her .
you know , moms like that , surprises on their birthdays .
you know , it &apos;s very hallmark .
i &apos;m 47 , you know ?
i &apos;m 47 and having a baby , which is kind of a miracle ,
and it kind of sucks , if you see what i mean .
we &apos;ve actually had given up on the kid thing about a year ago .
you know , fertility treatments ,
acupuncture needles in my eyes .
well , not really , but it felt like it .
it was like , &quot; screw this . i want my life back . &quot;
then one awesome night on the beach with a bottle of merlot ...
i should have these labs back in a couple hours .
you get it , right ?
my hesitation ?
this isn &apos;t an easy decision , i mean .
i &apos;m having a baby .
you have advanced @-@ stage carcinoma .
you &apos;re 47 years old ,
so statistically you have a good probability of survival .
forego treatment , chances are
you won &apos;t see your baby go to kindergarten ,
so whose life are you interested in saving ?
excuse me .
first my legs , then stomach . god .
doc ! doc , my hands can &apos;t move .
squeeze my fingers .
i can &apos;t .
right here . no ?
let me know if you feel this .
how about that ? here ?
anything here ?
up here ? ok .
nothing on this side ?
all right . i &apos;ll be right back .
nurse , cancel the second mri .
call down and prep or stat .
you &apos;re operating ? on what ?
if there was something to fix ,
wouldn &apos;t we see it ?
the mri missed a clot in his upper spine .
i &apos;m gonna cut him open . i &apos;m going in .
what if you &apos;re wrong ?
couldn &apos;t unnecessary spinal surgery do more damage ?
if we wait longer
and this expands we have a paralyzed man who can &apos;t breathe .
i &apos;m trusting my instincts .
sometimes you &apos;ve got to take a chance to save a life .
your mitral regurge is getting worse .
the valves are leakier than ever .
are you hitting on me ?
if you want me to .
i hear they call you dr. evilspawn .
well , only the people that like me .
i guess that explains the lack of faith thing .
you know , i kind of think of myself as a pagan ,
but , hey , that &apos;s just me .
you know what it &apos;s like being a teenager these days ?
my friends spend most of their time screwing around
and getting wasted .
at least i have god .
well , so god wants you to die , huh ?
he wants me to be passionate about what i believe in .
you don &apos;t believe in anything .
my mother used to pray to saint jude for me .
how appropriate .
patron saint of lost causes .
i did an angio on my psych case .
the mri came out clean ,
but i saw a ditzel .
there &apos;s something here .
yep , you &apos;re right .
there &apos;s an avm on his left temporal lobe .
i &apos;ll schedule the o.r. for tonight .
ohh , back up , girl .
there &apos;s high risk of spontaneous hemorrhage .
the attending has to see films . we need consent forms .
believe it or not , stevens ,
we have to follow protocol . take a breath
but if the avm looks like it &apos;s gonna blow ,
we fix it , right ?
if the man needs to be fixed , we &apos;ll fix him in due time .
why are you moving so quickly ?
you get too involved with your patients , izzie .
why do you make everything so personal ?
it &apos;s not personal .
it &apos;s not .
pulse ox , 98 .
we &apos;ve got to save this cord .
this guy &apos;s built like the rock of gibraltar .
you want me to start ?
no , i &apos;m going to cut here from the base of the neck to the rib cage .
i want you to hit the bleeders .
i still don &apos;t think we should be doing this .
this guy has a spinal hematoma .
we don &apos;t know that .
which left untreated are almost always fatal .
you &apos;re cutting blind .
whatever happened to being practical ?
i need to see more here . retractor .
the spine .
there &apos;s no &quot; wow &quot; in &quot; practical . &quot;
we have decided to go ahead with the evacuation .
what the hell , right ?
maybe this is how it &apos;s supposed to be .
we need to start chemo right away then .
we &apos;ll get everything ready .
have you ever done a d and c before ?
we learned at school .
ok , uh , go ahead .
i &apos;ll call an ob resident down to supervise .
if she needs anything , page me .
dr. grimm to icu stat .
dr. grimm to icu stat .
you &apos;re using up my oxygen , o &apos;malley .
how does a pompous , cocky jackass like you
always have women all over him ?
little blue love pills , lots of them .
come on .
float like a butterfly , sting like a bee .
there it is , a bovine xenograft .
o &apos;malley , you think too much .
can &apos;t you see it ?
you got to dance and jab .
dance and jab . like me .
i am the ali of this place .
does the wall ever bow back ?
it &apos;s called davening , smartass .
this is me communing with god ,
and you &apos;re interrupting .
i &apos;ve found a transplant option .
at first , i thought maybe a cadaver ,
but they &apos;re really hard to find .
and then i realized dr. burke can transplant
a bovine mitral valve instead of the pig .
she can get a cow valve ?
dr. burke , why wasn &apos;t this mentioned before ?
dr. karev .
the bovine valve has only been an option the last few years .
it &apos;s a much more complicated procedure .
but the best part is actually it &apos;s superior to the pig .
it lasts longer .
what incredibly small fraction of your brain were you using ?
what ?
correct me if wrong ,
but did you not present an alternative procedure
without consulting your attending first ?
i thought you &apos;d be ...
what ? impressed ? that &apos;s just stupid .
sorry ...
we &apos;re finished here , karev .
you &apos;re off this case .
you need to sign these consent forms
so we can proceed with your surgery .
sweetheart , i &apos;m not signing anything
unless it &apos;s got my name on followed by a whole bunch of zeros .
look , the avm is located in this crucial part of the brain .
it &apos;s a tangle of blood vessels that could burst
and affect speech , among other things .
we know your visions are actual seizures .
do you ?
do i what ?
know they &apos;re seizures .
you &apos;re really good at reading people , aren &apos;t you ?
telling them what they want to hear ?
there &apos;s an really unfortunate alignment
of saturn in the house of jupiter now .
ok . i know what you &apos;re doing .
you watch people , read their body language .
you say &quot; chocolate cupcakes , &quot;
i lean towards you ,
so you think you &apos;re on the right track .
not only do you know you &apos;re having seizures ,
but you &apos;re milking it .
well , we &apos;ll just see about that , cricket .
what ?
what did you just call me ?
i &apos;m gonna do a quick pelvic exam .
the ob resident should be down soon .
it &apos;s a short procedure .
your husband can stay if he likes .
we changed our minds .
excuse me ?
we &apos;ve decided to keep the baby .
you have cancer .
can you tell me
i &apos;ll survive if i go through with this ?
having the procedure does not necessarily improve the treatment outcome .
you have quite the bedside manner .
you know that , right ?
my mom died of breast cancer when she was in her 40s .
i have that cancer gene .
my chances are pretty much lose @-@ lose ,
whichever way you look at it ,
except for the baby .
we &apos;re keeping it .
i &apos;ll call down a psych consult .
don &apos;t bother . i am going to get fat and happy
instead of skinny and bald .
i &apos;m at the end ...
look , if you want to live ...
honey , that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing .
look , if you think you &apos;re gonna get any ,
think again .
i &apos;m not in the mood .
i &apos;m not in the mood , either .
good .
what do you want ?
nothing . i just haven &apos;t seen you all day .
so i &apos;m working .
i &apos;ve never done a bovine replacement before .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing .
look it up , research it
and get someone to assist you .
it &apos;s not that easy .
this is a problem that has a solution , burke .
there are a lot of problems that don &apos;t .
third thoracic laminae . nothing .
i think i see the dura pulsating here .
no , it &apos;s not . keep looking .
we have been at this for four hours .
maybe he just injured his spinal cord ,
and there &apos;s nothing to fix .
grey , when you read your books ,
make sure you reference them correctly .
progressive paralysis implies a pressure lesion .
my books got me here ...
pressure &apos;s up to 180 / 111 . the pulse is in the 40s .
what is it ?
i &apos;m pushing 70 milligrams diazoxide .
autonomic dysreflexia .
damage to the nervous system ?
bp and the heart rate are unstable .
we &apos;re in trouble , aren &apos;t we ?
we &apos;ve got to find the clot .
i can see the cord below the dura .
focus , grey . we &apos;re gonna find the clot .
it &apos;s there . clean up , please .
bp &apos;s still up . heart rate &apos;s at 44 .
get on those bleeders .
keep looking , dr. grey .
dr.o &apos;malley ? our patient &apos;s pulse ox is dropping .
she &apos;s agonal . she needs to be intubated .
is there anyone else who can do this ?
standing right here . i could try to find someone .
no , that &apos;s ... i got it .
sats down to 86 percent .
quit pressure , please .
ok . i see cords . tube . hurry .
check for breath sounds .
clear and equal .
co2 detector mellow yellow .
smooth moves , doctor .
kicked ass .
oh , dr. karev .
how long would it take to get a cow valve ?
oh , about 60 minutes by messenger .
you &apos;re scrubbing in .
thank you very much , sir .
this doesn &apos;t get you any points , karev .
i &apos;m the only one with points around here , ok ?
oh , by the way ,
devo wants a rabbi to bless her before surgery .
seriously ?
you came up with the cow ,
you can find that girl a rabbi .
irrigation and suction , have it ready .
right away .
what is it ?
see for yourself . the second thoracic vertebrae .
oh , my god .
i see it . it really is there .
of course it is .
let &apos;s suction and pack this baby , shall we ?
suction .
here you go .
dr. burke to oncology .
you were right .
is he gonna be ok ?
i think so .
but you don &apos;t know that .
i know we stopped the paralysis from advancing .
but you don &apos;t know if the paralysis he already has will be permanent .
no .
you know , you keep taking everything on faith .
how do you know what &apos;s real and what &apos;s not ?
you just do .
some people would call this a relationship .
the kind where you exchange keys , leave your toothbrush over .
who ? who would call it that ?
me .
i would .
and i &apos;m supposed to believe you ?
uh @-@ huh .
show me something .
give me a reason to believe .
i have your discharge papers .
oh , you &apos;re not happy with me , are you ?
i &apos;m your doctor . it &apos;s not my place to be happy .
my husband and child are going to be together long after i &apos;m gone .
we &apos;ve talked about it .
it &apos;s our decision , and that &apos;s ok .
so why do you need my approval ?
i just want you to understand .
well , i don &apos;t .
i brought the consent forms again .
you really need to sign them .
your surgeon scheduled the or .
mr. duff , are you all right ?
are you having another seizure ?
yeah . yeah .
i think maybe i am .
what is it ?
it &apos;s me .
i think it &apos;s about to be over .
we know what we &apos;re doing , mr. duff .
you saw the angio results .
we &apos;re catching the avm just in time .
you don &apos;t need to be nervous . you &apos;re not gonna die .
i &apos;m not talking about dying .
my whole life has been about what i see
and about believing in myself , whatever people think .
you &apos;re telling me there &apos;s a chance that will go away .
look , you &apos;re a healthy guy .
you &apos;re gonna live a long , full life .
if your psychic visions are real ,
you &apos;ve got to believe you &apos;ll have them when you come out .
she &apos;s good .
this is dr. chesney from the cleveland clinic .
he &apos;s an expert on bovine valve replacement surgery .
he will be assisting via satellite .
thank you , doctor .
after the sternotomy and connection to bypass ,
we &apos;re going to do a transverse left atriotomy
to expose the valve .
i tried to talk shepherd out of that clot surgery .

basically , you tried to kill the guy .
basically , you &apos;re an ass .
you know you want it . come to papi , baby .
this , uh , is george .
george has a hot date .

left pocket of my lab coat , georgie .
no glove , no love .
my psychic had his surgery .
yeah ?
i wonder what happened with his ... gift .
come on . we all know he &apos;s crazy .
you said you didn &apos;t believe in that stuff .
i grew up in a trailer park .
i waited tables , which was supposed to put me through college ,
but my mother was always calling these psychics all the time .
the bills started piling up ,
so i had to use my money to pay them .
when i turned 18 , i left and never went back .
but this guy has been saying things to me ,
things he couldn &apos;t possibly know anything about .
so i just wonder .
do you have sensation anywhere else ?
some feeling in my stomach and feet , i guess .
bladder and bowels ?
not so good still .
they said the pressure stockings help relieve clots and bedsores ?
they do .
i wanted to thank you for everything .
believing in me , that i wasn &apos;t making it up .
well , i &apos;ll come back tomorrow , then .
i wanted to show you something .
i wasn &apos;t sure it would last , but now look .
i know it &apos;s hardly anything , but ...
no , it &apos;s something .
it &apos;s something really big .
at the end of the day , faith is a funny thing .
it turns up when you don &apos;t really expect it .
mr. duff , you &apos;re still with us .
for your recipe ...
... one tablespoon coconut extract .
it &apos;s like one day you realize that the fairy tale
may be slightly different than you dreamed .
where are we going ?
trust me .
the castle , well ...
... it may not be a castle .
does it beat or moo ?
and it &apos;s not so important that it &apos;s happy ever after .
just that it &apos;s happy right now .
mom . it &apos;s me . cricket .
see , once in a while ,
once in a blue moon , people will surprise you .
i &apos;ve been thinking about you a lot too .
where are we ?

favorite band , the clash .
my favorite color is blue . i don &apos;t like light blue . indigo .
the scar right here on my forehead ,
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t ride motorcycles anymore .
and i live in that trailer .
all this land is mine .
i have no idea what i &apos;m gonna do with it .
so that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s all you &apos;ve earned for now .
the rest you &apos;re just ...

and once in a while ...
