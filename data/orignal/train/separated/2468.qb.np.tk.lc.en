who &apos;s thirsty ?
julian took over our town .
i suppose it wasn &apos;t so much of a takeover
as a walk right in , nobody stopping you .
alaric &apos;s babies are the future of the coven .
they &apos;re inside of you .
i &apos;m done , mary lou . it &apos;s over .
i found this is my mail .
it &apos;s a warning from the huntress .
once you &apos;ve been marked by her sword ,
she never stops hunting you .
there &apos;s no stopping her , ever .
if my friends &apos; lives are in danger ,
i &apos;m not gonna stand by and do nothing .
you came out of the phoenix stone ,
but you thought you were still inside of it .
hell messes with you , damon .
but post @-@ hell ...
peekaboo .
... is much worse .
can &apos;t you find someone else to haunt ? !
i can &apos;t leave until you find liberation .
i &apos;m not doing this with you anymore .
i promised you liberation .
elena !
you okay , man ?
mind giving me a hand ?
what are you doing out here ?
i don &apos;t know .
i thought it would make me feel better .
okay .
should i call someone or ... ?
what &apos;s your name ?
it &apos;s cooper .
cooper ,
you ever done something so unspeakably horrific
you couldn &apos;t even look yourself in the mirror ?
like , it literally makes you ill
to see your own reflection ?
and be honest now .
i ran over my girlfriend &apos;s cat
a couple months ago and didn &apos;t tell her .
even though it was an accident ,
i threw the body in a supermarket dumpster .
i killed the love of my life .
burned her alive while she was asleep .
i also beat one of her best friends
till he was unconscious and left him for dead ,
if we &apos;re keeping score .
i think i &apos;m just gonna go .
actually , i can use a ride .
i thought elena had changed me .
i thought she made me a better man , but ...
i was wrong .
i was so wrong .
it was always gonna end up this way .
with me destroying her .
that &apos;s what my whole tour of duty in the phoenix stone taught me
is that i &apos;m permanently damaged goods .
you ever feel that way , cooper ?
not really .
well , you &apos;re lucky .
coop , i &apos;m gonna kill you now .
excuse me ?
oh , it &apos;s nothing personal . i &apos;m hungry , you &apos;re food .
think of it as a stop at a drive @-@ thru window .
you know , you &apos;ll be afraid , i won &apos;t care .
honestly , i can &apos;t imagine caring about anyone ever again .
not a single solitary soul .
dear elena ,
i realized i haven &apos;t written in a while .
i &apos;m sorry .
apparently , pregnancy eats at your brain .
anyway , we all miss you .
and stefan &apos;s finally bouncing back
from his days in that phoenix stone hell .
but he &apos;s worried about damon .
a lot more so than usual .
sorry , i was trying to track down my brother .
curly fries or waffle ?
i brought both .
all of them , everything .
gimme , gimme , gimme !
oh , my god !
i love you .
are you talking to me or are you talking to the fries ?
do you want me to lie to you ?
i love you , too .
did you find him ?
no .
okay .
let me just chow down this cheeseburger ,
and then i will help you track him down .
are they kicking again ?
mm @-@ hmm , yeah . just ...
yeah , that wasn &apos;t very nice .
hey , you okay ?
i think i should just , um ...
i &apos;m just gonna stand up .
okay .
for a second .
hey , hey , caroline .
hey , caroline !
caroline !
so , crossbow ,
stake gun , wooden ammo ,
grenades filled with , uh ...
vervain .
vervain , right .
and you confiscated this stuff from a group
of zombie apocalypse survivalists ?
that &apos;s what i said .
i heard mystic falls has become a nutball magnet
for all sorts of supernatural thrill @-@ seekers .
people have a lot of spare time on their hands .
anything else , officer ares ?
no .
you &apos;re free to go .
here &apos;s your wallet , keys and phone .
ps-- your matchasingle.com
notifications are blowing up .
lucky you . mine &apos;s crickets .
you can call me penny , by the way .
and i didn &apos;t officially book you last night ,
so you know , you &apos;re welcome .
thanks .
hey , chin up .
turns out they aren &apos;t letting your town burn to the ground after all .
what do you mean ?
my friend doug got a call
from the mystic falls city planning office this morning .
they said he should come reclaim his house today .
something about the fire @-@ risk zone being reevaluated ?
do you know what street doug lives on ?
just to make things interesting .
bull &apos;s @-@ eye !
and for your courage , my bold friend ,
how would you like to make your new home
at 224 harmony lane ?
mr. and mrs. leonard here
have been called back to town so that they might invite you in .
who &apos;s next ?
i &apos;ll give it a go .
isn &apos;t this cozy ?
how nice it must feel to be surrounded by degenerate yes @-@ men .
how safe it must seem .
valerie , i &apos;m struggling to comprehend you showing your face
within 200 miles of me .
i really only wanted to give you something that was
delivered to me by mistake .
it &apos;s a shame someone won &apos;t be letting you feel safe for long .
phesmatos invenira venatrixos
isto gladulla onyx .
phesmatos invenira
venatrixos isto gladulla onyx .
ohio ? are you sure this isn &apos;t a prank or something ?
it &apos;s not a prank .
a ruthless killing machine is on her way to hunt us all down .
but why announce herself with a cryptic postcard ?
isn &apos;t the element of surprise a basic principle
of good vampire hunting ?
not for rayna cruz .
rayna has a taste for taunting her victims .
like a cat nibbling the legs off a spider .
what are you doing here ?
you got one , too .
and what about julian ?
no .
but i said we &apos;d take care of the problem .
for all our sakes .
your vampire huntress is currently
residing somewhere in cincinnati .
let &apos;s get going , nora .
the sooner she &apos;s dead , the better .
do think i just did that locator spell for a tune @-@ up ?
i &apos;m going with you .
we &apos;re good , thanks .
uh , i wasn &apos;t asking .
the last thing i need is a so @-@ called
ruthless killing machine
going after any of my friends .
i need to protect them and it &apos;s not like
i can trust either one of you to take her down .
and what makes you think we trust you ?
i trust her .
she actually cares about the well @-@ being of others .
unlike you , who only cares about pleasing julian .
i call shotgun .
when did you get this ?
there it is .
that &apos;s the look i &apos;ve been yearning to see .
why , julian , dare i say you seem afraid ?
what a shame to think you just made yourself a home here ,
and now you have to run .
kyle , if you kill this shrew right now ,
i &apos;ll throw in the lincoln family buick .
well , i feel happier .
what did i say would happen
if you ever harmed one of my men again ?
hmm , i think
it was something about you gutting me
and feeding my entrails to stefan .
bring it on .
she &apos;s napping now ,
but she &apos;s okay .
her heart &apos;s a little weak ,
but the babies appear to be totally fine .
are you sure ? she collapsed .
that &apos;s not normal .
well , it &apos;s not abnormal , either .
her blood vessels have dilated ,
which can lower blood pressure .
you know , it &apos;s best to keep the father
in the loop in situations like this .
would you like for me to contact her boyfriend ?
i &apos;m her boyfriend ...
um , yeah , no .
he &apos;s in , the father &apos;s in dallas for a job interview .
i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll call him .
scared me there for a minute .
what is this ?
is my hand desiccating ?
you have ten seconds left to live .
any last words ?
&quot; last words &quot; ?
that &apos;s a lot of pressure .
i guess if i had to ,
i would phrase it as a question .
what &apos;s the deal with the &quot; x marks the spot &quot; postcard ?
who are you running from , big j ?
well , that &apos;s not the concern of a dead man .
perhaps something a little more poetic .
two seconds .
it wouldn &apos;t happen to be
a sword @-@ wielding vixen that sent your ass straight to hell , would it ?
i &apos;ve hit a nerve .
hell @-@ hottie afoot . the end times are near .
i mean , i &apos;m assuming she &apos;s hot , right ?
hmm , i get it .
you &apos;re still in a little self @-@ destructive spiral
from your not @-@ so @-@ fantastic voyage into the phoenix stone .
you think ?
well , lily was my touchstone .
she was the very thing that tethered me to my sanity .
and when i lost her ,
well , that &apos;s when things really went off the rails .
so who did you lose ?
not lily , not stefan .
who was that epic love in the box ?
was it helena ? or eleanor ?
or ... ?
elena .
elena .
how is darling elena ?
i burned her alive .
see , i can &apos;t help but feel
a little bit responsible for what &apos;s happened .
why don &apos;t we have some fun ?
shall we ?
you know i love games .
and i think i have just the outlet
for the overwhelming pain you must be feeling .
since when do you eat disgusting garbage food ?
since i stopped caring about getting that exact reaction .
i have a question .
if rayna was chasing you through europe in the 19th century ,
how exactly is she still alive ?
she was spelled to be a vampire huntress by shamans .
they created that sword for her
and imbued her with extraordinary strength .
why shouldn &apos;t they give her a very long life to go with it ?
hey , do you remember that reading from class last week ?
you know , the one about those fragments
of native american myths ?
uh , the everlastings .
ah , the everlastings .
am i meant to be impressed you &apos;re study buddies
at a second @-@ rate college ?
no .
but feel free to try and be civil .
otherwise , we will be more than happy
to drop you off at the side of the road ,
and you can hitch a ride back to whatever rock you &apos;ve been living under .
well , that &apos;s not good .
yeah , duh , that &apos;s why we called you .
can you just be witchy and fix it ?
may i ?
what did you just do ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i think these babies are siphons , like me .
what ?
and i &apos;m afraid they might be feeding off your blood .
as in , they &apos;re literally siphoning
the vampire magic out of your body .
nuthouse for the criminally insane .
seems promising .
she is a deranged serial vampire killer .
maybe karma caught up with her .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m gonna need to see some i.d.s.
we &apos;re authorized personnel
here to see a patient by the name of rayna cruz .
tell us where to find her .
rayna cruz , room 658 , north wing .
so do we actually have a plan here ?
if we find her , we kill her .
you &apos;ll probably just watch .
don &apos;t be so cavalier , okay ?
you know what she &apos;s capable of ?
okay .
this is your vicious , terrifying , big bad huntress ?
got it .
i set up some sparring matches
for the new residents of mystic falls .
i thought it &apos;d be fun to dole out
the houses and their owners to the winners .
and the losers , well ...
the losers die , sadly .
it &apos;s been my experience over the centuries
that the only true remedy for extreme mental anguish ...
... raw physical brutality .
you really want to feel pain , damon ?
get in there .
come on !
hello ?
anyone home ?
hello ?
doug , are you at home ?
what are you doing here ?
what does it look like ? i followed you .
put the gun down .
you need to leave now .
first , tell me what &apos;s going on .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , my god .
what ?
wooden bullets .
if you &apos;re gonna wear a uniform in mystic falls ,
you need wooden bullets .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a talisman spelled with magic .
i &apos;m hoping the babies will pull from it instead of you .
and if they don &apos;t ?
they still have to bake in there a little bit longer .
and i haven &apos;t even done the thank you notes
from the baby shower yet .
if it doesn &apos;t work ,
i &apos;ll find something stronger .
i won &apos;t let anything bad happen , i promise .
thank you .
my pleasure .
no , really .
you know , we &apos;re not meant to like each other , you and i ,
which makes what you &apos;re doing all that much nicer .
so thank you .
i &apos;ll be back .
better start getting used to the coffee .
doctor asked her to stay for observation .
the desiccation hasn &apos;t come back .
i think the babies have been siphoning
very slowly for a long time .
she just didn &apos;t realize it .
and try not to worry .
it doesn &apos;t do any good .
by the way , um , have you spoken to your brother today ?
no , he hasn &apos;t been returning my calls .
why ? have you ?
i saw him ... earlier at the mystic grill .
he seemed to be very intent on getting under julian &apos;s skin .
he made quite a show of decapitating one of his men .
what ? why would he do that ?
julian warned us to stay away from his friends .
seemed like he had a bit of a death wish to me .
come on .
feeling better yet ?
what else you got ?
i &apos;m sorry , what did you say your names were again ?
i &apos;m bonnie , she &apos;s nora , that &apos;s mary louise .
and you &apos;re rayna , right ?
sounds right .
and we don &apos;t look familiar to you ?
should you ?
considering you &apos;re a murderous vampire @-@ hunting bitch
who chased us across europe for decades ,
yeah , we should look familiar .
you sent one of these to all of us .
ring a bell ?
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t know what any of that means .
you wouldn &apos;t happen to have a cookie , would you ?
they only feed me through a tube these days .
are you thinking what i &apos;m thinking ?
we should stop stalling and slit her throat ?
no , we &apos;re thinking this couldn &apos;t possibly be
the woman we &apos;re looking for .
she couldn &apos;t send a postcard let alone kill a vampire .
we don &apos;t know that for sure . why should we risk it ?
i &apos;m not letting you kill an old woman
whose only cold @-@ blooded ruthless mission
is to eat a ginger snap .
bonnie &apos;s right .
of course she is .
bonnie &apos;s right about everything .
she &apos;s perfect .
we &apos;ll keep looking .
she &apos;s probably here under another name .
i &apos;ll keep looking .
you stay here and bat your eyes .
go help her look for her .
why ?
she &apos;s being surly .
yeah , isn &apos;t that the point ?
the point of what ?
you &apos;re using me to make her jealous .
and it &apos;s working .
i &apos;m tired of being in the middle of it ,
so just go help her look for her .
sampson ! sampson ! sampson !
sampson ! sampson ! sampson !
sam here has never lost a fight .
perhaps the pain he inflicts will finally feel like atonement .
rip his head off !
yeah ! rip his head off !
come on .
no weapons !
those are the rules !
all right , damon .
i think we &apos;re done here .
no .
i want to go again .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve grown bored of this game .
who &apos;s next ?
who &apos;s next ?
i am .
you want to fight again ?
then you fight me next .
damon !
damon !
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
you made a wrong turn , brother .
this isn &apos;t some hell survivor support group .
are you in or out ?
do not get into that ring .
leave with me right now .
whatever &apos;s going on ,
we will figure it out .
are you in or are you out ?
i &apos;m in .
thought you might like some terrible reading material
and some real food .
seeing as you &apos;re eating for three and jell @-@ o won &apos;t cut it .
uh , where &apos;s stefan ?
he had to step out for a bit .
step out where ?
step out where , valerie ?
he went to mystic falls .
damon &apos;s gotten himself into some trouble with julian .
what ?
no , i @-@ i told him he didn &apos;t have to worry ,
that i would stay here and look after you .
yeah , of course you did .
god , if you hate julian so much ,
can &apos;t you just go kill him yourself ?
what ? no , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s not about that .
you want stefan to defend your honor by killing julian ,
so he can prove that he still cares about you .
no , of course not . i just ...
you have to go make sure stefan &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m serious .
i don &apos;t want you here with me , i want you there
with him .
i feel fine .
so just go .
what are you doing ?
this guy &apos;s got 300 years on you .
then it should be a good fight .
that stone is still messing with your head , damon .
let me help you get through it .
there &apos;s nothing to get through , stefan .
this is what i deserve .
deserve ? what are you talking about ?
what do you deserve , huh ?
you don &apos;t back off , brother ,
i will destroy you like i &apos;ve destroyed
everything good i &apos;ve ever touched .
something happened to you .
tell me .
tell me what happened to you , damon .
will someone please escort stefan off the premises ?
i &apos;m not just gonna walk away
and let you fight this guy to the death .
doesn &apos;t look like you have much say in the matter .
don &apos;t do this , damon .
don &apos;t do this !
godspeed , brother .
hard to believe they don &apos;t have vending machines
in high @-@ security psychiatric prisons ,
but i managed to snag you an oatmeal cookie .
from someone else &apos;s meal tray .
what was your name again ?
bonnie .
you seem like a nice girl , bonnie .
what &apos;s a nice girl like you
doing with two deviant vampires ?
so you are the huntress .
i don &apos;t think you can really call me that anymore .
now i &apos;m just an old woman in a dingy room ,
waiting to die .
how did you end up here ?
i was careless .
the drive to kill--
the drive instilled upon me by the shamans--
it got a little scrambled in my old age .
i staked a checkout girl at the supermarket .
my mistake .
could you ...
help me with the cookie , please ?
mo ... motus ...
i &apos;m afraid your magic won &apos;t work on me .
now untie my hands
before i crush your windpipe to dust .
who the hell are you ?
you all right ?
i &apos;m fine . what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s a long story , luv .
let &apos;s just say , for today , that i &apos;m your guardian angel .
i never had a brother .
no siblings at all , actually .
seems i dodged a bullet there .
that makes sense .
you were a lonely little tadpole .
that &apos;s why you need to surround yourself
with lowlife , degenerate bloodsuckers like these .
at least i have friends .
you &apos;ve driven away every last soul who ever cared for you .
well , i guess i &apos;ll just have to cuddle up
next to the fire with all my rage .
you &apos;re not really looking for your brother , are you ?
i mean , even if stefan did come back ,
what do you think he would do
when he found out what you did to elena ?
go ahead .
rip my heart out .
you know it &apos;s not that i wouldn &apos;t love to do it ,
but ... are you sure ?
do it .
listen to me .
if you let julian rip your heart out ,
i will kill him
and then every single person here
will instantly rip my head off .
but you don &apos;t care , do you ?
your life doesn &apos;t matter and neither does mine , does it ?
come on , brother .
come on .
if they come back , kill them !
where have you been ?
just fell off the face of the earth .
you missed me !
that warms my heart .
i didn &apos;t miss you ,
i &apos;m curious as to your recent whereabouts .
there &apos;s a difference .
what , matt didn &apos;t tell you ?
thought he &apos;d be crowing all over town
he &apos;d called in some shadowy organization
to hunt me down and cage me up .
matt did that ?
it didn &apos;t turn out the way he &apos;d expected , guarantee you that .
now , look , we &apos;ve got to get this body out of here
before someone notices so a bit of cloaking
would probably be helpful .
are you all right ?
i &apos;m fine , considering i was almost strangled to death
by an 80 @-@ year @-@ old psychopath .
did you know the huntress was immune to magic ?
i had no idea , i swear .
that lying little weasel .
where are you going ?
nowhere in particular ; i don &apos;t have a destination .
so you don &apos;t have anything to say
about what happened back there ?
you &apos;re right , stefan .
giving julian the satisfaction of ripping my heart out
would have been a mistake .
thanks for the intervention .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it .
you &apos;re just gonna walk away ,
you &apos;re gonna flip your switch .
flip my switch ?
i &apos;m not gonna &quot; flip my switch , &quot; stefan .
i want to feel pain .
i want to feel every miserable moment of this miserable life .
what is this about ?
what did you do ?
i killed her .
i killed elena .
what do you ... what do you mean , you killed elena ?
it was all henry &apos;s idea .
told me i needed to free my true self
so i kidnapped tyler
and made him take me to her coffin .
and then i burned her to ashes .
so go ahead .
stand by me .
tell me you &apos;ll never walk away .
go ahead , stefan , come on .
do it . do it !
should probably get back to the hospital .
should i drive ?
i hate to think we survived all that
just to have you kill us both on the road .
i &apos;m fine .
you don &apos;t seem fine .
this is all julian &apos;s fault .
took lily away from me when i was too young to lose a mother .
he hurt you .
he killed our child .
he destroyed damon .
he has my home .
he has my town .
and what do i do ?
i let him live .
he &apos;s strong and well @-@ protected .
there &apos;s revenge and then there &apos;s stupidity .
damon might not understand the difference , but you &apos;re smarter .
i don &apos;t want to be the smart one anymore .
i want him dead .
if you &apos;re about to say , &quot; penny for your thoughts , &quot;
i &apos;m gonna punch you in the face .
i wasn &apos;t .
pretty sure i already know what you &apos;re thinking .
i &apos;m processing .
just give me a minute .
so vampires are a thing ,
and mystic falls has always had vampires ,
but now it &apos;s been completely overrun .
anything else i should know about ?
i think that &apos;s enough for one night .
so that &apos;s what the weapons in your truck were for ,
fighting vampires .
are you crazy ?
what are you still doing in this place ?
i don &apos;t talk to my parents .
my sister &apos;s dead .
this town is the only constant i have .
besides , once you know the supernatural is real ,
there &apos;s really nowhere to hide .
might as well just take a stand , right ?
you are 100 % not who i thought you were .
i mean , i thought you were cute ,
maybe a little damaged ,
in a sweet way .
but i didn &apos;t know that you were insanely brave .
emphasis on the &quot; insane . &quot;
i thought you &apos;d be back in mystic falls by now .
i just , uh ...
wanted to say thank you .
for today .
we still make a good team , don &apos;t you think ?
well , rayna &apos;s dead .
julian &apos;s safe .
you &apos;ll surely sleep easy tonight .
do you like her ?
bonnie ?
and what if i did ?
she &apos;s beautiful .
smart and loyal .
and you appear to be only two of those things .
i &apos;m sorry i chose julian .
if i could take it back , i would choose you .
every time .
i love you , nora .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me someday .
we do ...
still make a good team .
okay , so you &apos;re both awake .
i get it .
i &apos;m bored , too .
and i know that my magic blood tastes really good ,
but you &apos;re both gonna have to show
just a little bit of self @-@ control
for a little bit longer , okay ?
why don &apos;t we watch some tv ? hmm ?
stefan .
stefan , what a surprise .
can i buy you a drink ?
no , thank you .
i really admire what you did for your brother today .
you know , it &apos;s a shame nothing will come of it .
i &apos;m afraid your brother &apos;s too far gone to be rehabilitated .
hmm , you &apos;re probably right .
of course , uh ...
... that &apos;s all your fault for running that sword through him
and sending him to hell .
do you really think it &apos;s wise ...
... to brazenly attack me in front of all my friends ?
here &apos;s the thing : they can &apos;t see you .
maybe this is cheating ...
... but i don &apos;t really care .
hello .
again .
you never said thank you .
big sam was about to snap your head off .
i tossed you that stick .
right .
sorry , i &apos;m having trouble keeping track
of all the people trying to save me today .
promise i won &apos;t do it again .
you like tequila ?
more of a bourbon man , but ...
... what do i got to lose ?
you see ?
i knew if i sent those postcards
one of the heretics would lead me right to you .
what are you doing here ?
caroline &apos;s safe . i got her out .
she &apos;s with rick now .
damon &apos;s still inside .
i managed to disable the security cameras
so no one can see out here ,
but i &apos;m worried the ones on the roof are on a different circuit .
all right , i did it . he &apos;s out .
now i never see you again , right ?
yes , thank you .
have a nice life .
