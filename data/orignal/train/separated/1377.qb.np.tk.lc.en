oh , god , no .
i &apos;ve experienced some symptoms ,
headaches , um , occasional memory loss .
yes , i @-@ i was diagnosed with chiari malformation after the fall .
yes . yes , i &apos;ve decided to have decompression surgery .
my -- my doctor thinks that it could eliminate
some of the pressure caused from the injury .
later today .
no , no . there &apos;s no reason for you to go out of your way .
it -- it is a minor procedure . i will be home tomorrow .
okay , i &apos;ve -- i &apos;ve gotta run .
okay , talk to you soon .
‭ okay . i told you it was a bad idea to call her .
now she wants to come by the hospital .
maura , she &apos;s concerned .
well , there &apos;s nothing to be concerned about .
it &apos;s what mothers do .
i don &apos;t want to make a big deal out of it .
what have you got there ?
heaven in a bag .
bernie brody &apos;s bodacious bagels .
is that the new place around the corner ?
yeah , with a line around the block .
aw . i can &apos;t have anything before my surgery .
but that isn &apos;t until this afternoon .
i know , but i have to fast .
it &apos;s okay . please , no . you guys go ahead .
rizzoli .
isles .
yeah , i got it .
okay . we &apos;ll be right there .
what about your surgery ?
well , it &apos;s not till 1,
so i figured i would work till then just like any other day .
it &apos;s still warm .
i hate you .
put it in your pocket .
wh --
do you know the hole in the middle
provides for more even cooking ?
but also allow people to thread a string through it
for easy handling and transportation ?
no .
they even gave it to women in childbirth as gifts
in 17th century poland .
who knew that there was that much bagel trivia
to last a 30 @-@ minute car ride ?
oh , i &apos;m so hungry . hello , sergeant .
victim is michelle stevens .
husband said she fell down the stairs in the middle of the night .
anybody see her do it ?
no .
daughter found the body . husband called 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
any sign of forced entry ?
nothing broken or jimmied .
there are some scuff marks by a window in the back .
couldn &apos;t tell how old they are .
sergeant korsak ? we need you in the den .
there &apos;s a lot of blood .
the victim sustained severe cranial trauma
resulting in massive hemorrhaging .
that &apos;s another way to put it .
there &apos;s blood on the railing .
yeah , and the position of the body
is consistent with a slip and fall ,
and an initial wound caused by striking the railing
on the way down , but i can &apos;t say for sure .
yeah , but the railing didn &apos;t cause the massive hemorrhaging ,
or there &apos;d be more blood on the stairs , right ?
yeah , more than likely .
at least some spatter .
i &apos;ll give you that .
so ... she lands hard at the bottom of the stairs ,
starts bleeding ,
maintains consciousness long enough
to smear blood on the walls before passing out .
that is consistent with what we see .
interesting .
i wonder if that place makes cherry bagels .
how &apos;d you get here ? connecticut ?
no . i , uh , came the usual way .
the usual way is with korsak .
hey , frankie .
nina said you left this in the car .
thanks , garcia .
nina brought you to work today ?
the victim &apos;s husband and daughter are waiting to talk to us .
okay .
we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
thank you .
what time did you find your mother , clair ?
um ... around 2 .
that &apos;s pretty late .
i got up to go to the bathroom .
i went out and ...
was she breathing ?
no .
she was just lying there .
so still .
had you heard anything before that ?
no .
what about you , mr. stevens ?
sorry ?
did you hear anything like a @-@ a thump or call for help ?
no . the , um , the bedrooms are on the other end of the house .
you didn &apos;t know she &apos;d gotten out of bed ?
i don &apos;t know if she ever got into bed .
um , my wife and i were down here drinking ,
and , uh , i got tired , so i decided to go upstairs .
michelle wanted to watch tv , so i , um ...
i left her .
she must &apos;ve come upstairs later in the dark ,
tipsy from all the red wine and slipped and , uh ...
and that &apos;s when clair found her ?
i heard clair scream .
can i lie down ?
is it okay ? the , um , the emts gave her sedatives .
that &apos;s fine , but we need to collect your clothes .
yes , and also we need your permission to search the property .
why ?
just to rule out foul play .
yeah , of -- of course .
whatever you need .
thank you .
it &apos;s gonna be okay , sweetheart .
how you doing ?
well ...
careful .
dietary restrictions has her a little bit grumpy .
i am not grumpy !
i &apos;m simply focused .
why don &apos;t you go home , maura ?
because it is a work day , and i have work to do .
okay .
so what &apos;d you find ?
well , there were high levels of alcohol in her system ...
... just like her husband said ,
and the bruising on the back of her body ...
... is consistent with a fall down the stairs .
what the hell is that ?
he &apos;s working with melons .
well , you don &apos;t break out the melons
for a simple slip and fall , do we , kent ?
no , jane , we don &apos;t .
now observe .
this is the equivalent of falling down a flight of stairs .
certainly painful , but not fatal .
now this is the amount of force that &apos;d be required
to sustain the victim &apos;s injuries .
like a fruit homicide .
fruiticide .
due to the severe cranial damage ,
i can &apos;t say exactly what struck her .
but i do know that she didn &apos;t do it to herself .
any questions , detective ?
just one .
what did these melons ever do to you ?
what &apos;d you find out about our family ?
oh , they &apos;re pretty impressive on paper .
so are the kardashians .
well , michelle &apos;s an ivy league @-@ educated lawyer
with a thriving practice .
maybe she made an enemy in court ?
she doesn &apos;t go to court .
her specialty is contract law . it &apos;s pretty tame stuff .
what about robert ?
stanford alum .
he &apos;s got a successful antiquities business
dealing in greek artifacts .
and he &apos;s active in charity work ,
volunteers at his daughter &apos;s school .
he coached her field hockey team .
what about the daughter ?
she &apos;s an honor student and an athlete .
i mean , they don &apos;t have any financial problems .
there &apos;s no history of domestic violence ,
no criminal records .
these don &apos;t seem like the type of people who kill each other .
well , there were scuff marks around the window .
maybe someone else got in the house .
‭ clair has a boyfriend .
she texted him several times last night
about a fight with her mother .
then there was a series of phone calls between them .
that &apos;s something clair never mentioned in her moment of grief .
well , if you want , i could give your doctor a breathalyzer .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
good , &apos; cause i don &apos;t think it &apos;s legal .
but i would do it if it would make you feel better .
there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
you know , the operation lasts a couple of hours .
they make a small incision in the back of the neck .
they push the skin and the muscle aside
and remove a piece of the skull to relieve the pressure .
that doesn &apos;t sound so simple .
i promise you , i will be up and walking around by this evening .
hello , everyone .
hello .
hi , hope .
come on in .
i told you , you didn &apos;t have to come .
well , i couldn &apos;t stay away .
plus , i wanted to speak with your surgeon
before he put you under .
well , i &apos;ll see you in recovery .
i told her she didn &apos;t have to come to the hospital .
i know that you don &apos;t want to make a big deal about this ,
all right , but she &apos;s your mom .
they ...
butt in .
all the time .
okay , we don &apos;t have this kind of easy rapport .
you think this is easy ?
it &apos;s not .
she &apos;s tough , she &apos;s stubborn ,
she &apos;s hard on me for everything .
what ? you &apos;re lucky to have me .
you &apos;re lucky to have me .
i know !
hope and i , we &apos;re -- we &apos;re just ...
we don &apos;t know how to do this whole mother / daughter thing .
what is it that you said , that you --
you wanted to create new neural ...
thingies ?
pathways .
all right , well , maybe this is your chance now
to create new ...
mother / daughter pathways .
gary carver ?
are you clair stevens &apos; boyfriend ?
maybe .
do you know why we &apos;re here ?
no .
clair &apos;s mother was murdered .
what the hell ?
where were you last night ?
i was at a party at a friend &apos;s .
does this friend have a name ?
steve ulrich .
clair go with you ?
yeah .
when did you plan to get together ?
right before i picked her up .
clair had a fight with her mom
because she wouldn &apos;t let her go out ,
and i told her about the party ,
and she asked me to come get her .
so you picked her up at her place ?
yeah . she snuck out .
how long did you stay at the party ?
when we got there , she was acting weird ,
so we -- we hung out for a little while ,
but i finally told her to go home .
did you drive her ?
no .
so chivalry is dead . how &apos;d she get home ?
she said she &apos;d figure it out . i @-@ i don &apos;t know what she did .
i never left the party . i crashed there .
have you talked to clair today ?
no .
write down steve ulrich &apos;s number , please .
you can go .
thank you .
don &apos;t leave town .
i wonder why clair didn &apos;t mention she went to a party .
what &apos;s going on between frankie and nina ?
frankie and nina ?
yeah , remember them ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
they &apos;re so dating . i knew it !
okay , how serious is it ?
i never said they were dating .
you didn &apos;t have to . come on .
when has frankie ever been able to keep a secret from me ?
hello .
all right , thank you .
listen to me .
maura &apos;s gonna be out for a few more hours .
if you hear anything , please call me . okay ?
okay , do me a favor .
what ?
you have to let frankie tell you about nina himself .
of course .
i mean it .
you say that like i don &apos;t listen to you .
that &apos;s because you never listen to me !
well , then why say it ?
you didn &apos;t tell us the truth about last night .
no . my client was sedated .
she can &apos;t be held accountable for her omissions .
that &apos;s not what we &apos;re saying .
why did you think a lawyer was necessary ?
a friend from her mother &apos;s law firm insisted .
he said it &apos;s what michelle would &apos;ve wanted .
you and your mother have a fight ?
yeah .
what &apos;d you fight about ?
my boyfriend and not letting me ...
she had words with her mother about going out .
clair went upstairs . she snuck out the window
and went with the boyfriend to a party .
when she got home ,
she found her mother at the bottom of the stairs .
what time did she get home ?
michelle was so tough on clair .
how tough ?
well , she thought she was too young to have a boyfriend .
and what did you think ?
that we should all get along .
i try to be a peacemaker .
everybody my age has a boyfriend .
it &apos;s not fair ! she -- she didn &apos;t like anyone that i liked .
clair ...
is that why you texted your boyfriend
that you hated her ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
clair , we have the texts .
i was just mad . she was always yelling at me !
clair . clair , that &apos;s enough .
those texts don &apos;t mean anything .
you sure ? - she -- she was just angry .
she -- she would never hurt her mother .
we verified everything the boyfriend told us
except his whereabouts after clair left .
kid throwing the party said the boyfriend went into a guest room ,
but he didn &apos;t see him again till the next morning .
it could be he passed out .
or he could &apos;ve gone to clair &apos;s house
with her and killed her mother .
neither clair nor her boyfriend
have ever been in trouble with the police .
and it &apos;s a long way from being mad at your mother
to killing her .
i should know .
yeah .
well , it wouldn &apos;t be the first time
young lovers did something crazy .
you &apos;re never gonna believe what nina and i just dug up .
try me .
20 years ago , robert &apos;s girlfriend ,
who he was living with at the time , died accidentally .
guess how ?
she fell down some stairs .
while robert was sleeping .
almost exactly the same as our victim .
i was doing background research on robert ,
but couldn &apos;t find any record of him attending stanford .
made me think maybe he was lying .
turns out he didn &apos;t go to stanford .
he went to seattle community college .
so i called the school and talked to a librarian .
she dug up an old article that mentioned how robert
found his girlfriend dead in their apartment .
and i got ahold of the seattle detective who handled the case .
robert told him that he was sound asleep the night
that his pregnant girlfriend fell down the stairs .
police found no signs of foul play ,
so they ruled it an accident .
in the world of coincidences , that &apos;s a doozy .
which probably means it wasn &apos;t a coincidence .
we need that case file .
good job , you two .
thanks .
yeah .
how are you feeling ?
a bit of a headache from the anesthesia .
i &apos;ll bet .
but i remembered my name .
and i completed a memory inventory
of the skeletal structure from the &quot; gray &apos;s anatomy &quot; chart .
and where would i find my levator anguli oris ?
there are two located symmetrically
on either side of your face .
and when they work in unison ,
the corners of the mouth move upward ,
producing what is universally known as a smile .
textbook @-@ perfect .
excellent sign of long @-@ term memory .
jane has been calling every 20 minutes .
then i let her know that you are on your way up .
and i also ...
asked angela to let me take care of you .
i hope that &apos;s okay .
of course .
well , anything else that i can get you now ?
i &apos;m good .
okay .
how &apos;s maura ?
she is out of surgery
and in the recovery room and doing fine .
you &apos;re gonna like this .
robert came from a blue collar background ,
even though he claims a childhood of affluence and privilege .
and his antiquities business hasn &apos;t been very profitable .
so for the past 15 years ,
he &apos;s been living off his wife &apos;s money ?
which he &apos;ll get half of now that she &apos;s dead .
motive .
who gets the other half ?
clair .
motive .
yeah , but clair didn &apos;t kill his college girlfriend .
no , she didn &apos;t .
let &apos;s go rattle his cage .
paging dr. price .
please report to the emergency room immediately .
why is this so difficult ?
because we don &apos;t really know each other .
and you have a daughter , and i have a mother .
square peg , round hole .
something like that .
i always thought about you , maura .
when kateline &apos;s hurt her knee and i bandaged it ...
i thought about what it would &apos;ve been like to take care of you .
and when i took her to her first day of school ,
i pictured your first day .
i &apos;d still like to take care of you ,
even if it &apos;s just for today .
sure .
we just wanna speak to him .
he &apos;s already told you everything he knows about this matter .
he did not tell us how his college girlfriend died .
that &apos;s what this is about ?
robert , be quiet .
what are the odds that his girlfriend and his wife
both fall down a flight of stairs
and die from head injuries ?
you &apos;d have a better chance of getting struck by lightning twice
after buying the winning powerball ticket .
it &apos;s just a coincidence .
great . prove it . take a lie detector test .
that &apos;s not admissible in court .
then what &apos;s the problem ?
give us a reason to believe you .
your name is robert andrew stevens ?
yes .
was holly franklin your girlfriend in college ?
yes , she was .
did you live together ?
yes , for almost two years .
did you two fight ?
not much .
did you have anything to do with her death ?
no . it was ruled an accident .
he &apos;s smart .
he &apos;s playing us .
hey , you gotta see this .
over the last two months ,
robert supposedly went on three business trips to europe .
i finally heard back from i.c.e. about his passport .
there &apos;s no record of any overseas travel .
so where was he ?
well , credit cards place him downtown .
so we canvassed the area around his last purchase .
someone at the four seasons remembered him .
we got security video showing him with three different women
on three different nights .
and if his wife found out ...
bye @-@ bye , gravy train .
well , he has agreed to talk in front of us .
yes ?
now &apos;s our chance to get him on the record .
what &apos;s she doing ?
we &apos;re about to find out .
did you ever have an affair , robert ?
what are you talking about ?
did you cheat on your wife ?
you don &apos;t have to answer that .
no , i never cheated on her .
explain these photos , please .
those are women i had sex with ,
but i wouldn &apos;t consider it cheating
because my wife knew all about them .
shit .
we had an open marriage .
so your wife had affairs , too ?
you don &apos;t really wanna know about our relationship .
you just wanna hear me say that i ... murdered her .
so why don &apos;t you have the guts to ask me to my face , detective ?
did you kill your wife ?
no .
looks like he &apos;s telling the truth .
and it &apos;s on the record .
i mean , i know he that he passed the lie detector test ,
but it &apos;s just ...
something ... something &apos;s not right .
well , i can &apos;t tell you whether robert &apos;s guilty or not ,
but the one thing i &apos;m certain of are your instincts .
now people can beat lie detectors ,
especially if they &apos;re pathological liars .
they do it so often there &apos;s no physiological response to lying .
and that &apos;s all these machines read .
well , he &apos;s definitely a pathological liar .
then don &apos;t second guess yourself .
i was worried about you .
i know .
i &apos;m not saying that because you said something nice about me .
really , like , you -- are you sure that you &apos;re okay ?
you know , the surgery went well . i feel pretty good .
but will it fix the problem ? only time will tell .
i thought some homemade chicken soup would be perfect .
and the compound carnosine --
it purifies the blood and it aids in healing .
and it smells so good .
mm .
jane , would you like some soup ?
oh , uh , no , thank you .
i &apos;ve , uh , i gotta get back to work .
ooh , i think i want a bagel , too .
eh . sit . oh .
i will get you one .
it &apos;s hard to get used to being mothered .
you sort of have to surrender to it .
that &apos;s what daughters do .
be good .
hi . how &apos;s it going ?
frankie found another kid at the party .
he saw the boyfriend passed out in a guest room
2 : 00 a.m. , so we can take him off the list .
and what about his claims of his open marriage ?
well , the wife is dead .
we didn &apos;t find any evidence of an affair . so ...
the only thing we &apos;re positive he lied about
is where he went to college .
but lots of people lie on their résumé .
it doesn &apos;t make them murderers .
what about the girlfriend &apos;s death ?
well , i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this ,
but what if it is a coincidence ?
i know , i know . it &apos;s ridiculous .
but we gotta find some evidence to convince the d.a.
he &apos;s not gonna trust your gut the way i do .
okay , so we had three people in the house that night ,
and one of &apos; em ends up dead .
so either robert killed michelle
or clair did or they did it together .
but robert has controlled every aspect
of our interaction with clair .
he had her sedated at the crime scene .
he had a lawyer answer most of our questions for her .
which tells us if they were both involved , he didn &apos;t trust her .
or if he killed his wife ,
clair knows something that could expose them .
the only way to figure that out is to talk to clair alone .
we can &apos;t do that . she has a lawyer .
the only problem is if she incriminates herself .
which could be a very big problem .
you &apos;re not supposed to talk to me .
well , technically ,
you walked over here and started talking to me .
you can walk away if you want to .
you headed to practice ?
my dad says that we have to stay busy
after my mom &apos;s accident .
it wasn &apos;t an accident , clair .
i can let you talk to the medical examiner if you want .
well , then what happened ?
we &apos;re not sure ,
but if you didn &apos;t kill her ...
hey , what the hell are you doing ?
my card is in your backpack .
if you know something ,
if you see anything unusual , you call me .
you are the only one who can speak for your mother now .
haven &apos;t we been harassed enough by you people ?
if you wanna speak to us , call our lawyer .
what &apos;d she say ?
i am sure that you will be ready
to go back to work tomorrow .
i hope so .
what do you mean ?
i just ... worry about my memory .
what if it affected my ability to testify ?
or what if the surgery didn &apos;t work ?
there &apos;s no reason to go there yet .
i just -- i don &apos;t know what i would do
if i didn &apos;t work in the m.e. &apos; s office .
well , there are always alternatives .
science and medicine aren &apos;t just parts of my job .
they &apos;re parts of who i am .
so i don &apos;t know who i would be without it .
well , i &apos;m just suggesting that
there might be another avenue for your gifts .
like what ?
like working with the living instead of the dead .
and i happen to know a woman who has several clinics
who could really use someone like you .
you never know where life leads , maura .
but one thing that i am certain of --
you will have a fulfilling life after your career as an m.e.
guess who i just heard from ?
robert &apos;s lawyer ?
that &apos;s right . he &apos;s talking police harassment .
well , we don &apos;t have a case .
i doubt he can sue us without one .
well , maybe we don &apos;t have a case
because we focused on the wrong person .
clair had nothing to do with this .
he is threatening us so we stay away from her .
and she is the only liability that he has left .
‭ rizzoli .
o @-@ okay , okay . w @-@ where are you ?
okay , stay put . all right , we &apos;ll be right there .
clair followed robert to some storage facility .
what the hell is wrong with you people ? !
there he is .
let me see your hands !
get out of the car .
get out of the car slowly .
now ! now !
korsak .
i got him .
i &apos;d love to hear you explain this one .
where &apos;s your lawyer ?
i don &apos;t need him .
well , we &apos;re all ears .
i , um ...
i lied about what happened to my wife .
i heard a commotion that night .
arguing .
and what sounded like someone falling down , then a scream .
i , uh , jumped out of bed ,
ran down the hallway , and found ...
my wife laying at the bottom of the stairs .
why would clair kill her mother ?
i think she just snapped .
michelle was always so hard on her ,
always putting her down .
clair wasn &apos;t strong enough , smart enough , pretty enough .
her boyfriends were never good enough .
so if clair lashed out and killed her mother ,
why did we find you with the murder weapon ?
clair begged me to help her .
i had just lost my wife .
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t lose my stepdaughter , too .
exactly what did you do ?
clair and i came up with the story
that michelle fell down the stairs .
i took the murder weapon straight to the storage facility
and hid it .
then i came home and ...
and sent clair to the party with her boyfriend
so that she would have an alibi .
i waited for her to -- to come back home and , uh , we --
she had called 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
and why hang on to the murder weapon ?
i @-@ i didn &apos;t know what to do with it .
didn &apos;t have time to destroy it so i just hid it ,
figured that i &apos;d deal with it later .
is that what you were doing tonight ?
i told clair that i was gonna get rid of it ,
put this behind us once and for all ,
but i guess she figured that if you found me
with the murder weapon , that you would be convinced
that i was the m--
killer , and she would get away with murder .
but why would she think that ? you both were in the clear .
because she really doesn &apos;t trust anybody ,
even me .
it &apos;s maura .
be right back .
yeah .
the field hockey stick may possibly be the murder weapon .
possibly ?
well , i can &apos;t match
the shape of the stick to the wound pattern
because the cranial damage was so severe .
but the blood on the stick matches the victim &apos;s .
are his prints on it ?
there are a lot of prints on it , but they all belong to clair .
well , he could &apos;ve been wearing gloves when he used the stick .
well , if that were the case ,
then we &apos;d expect to see smudges on the prints ,
but there were none .
ah , there you are .
uh , we just received the autopsy report
from robert &apos;s ex @-@ girlfriend in seattle .
i put it on your desk .
great . could you please lay out all of the photos
so we can go over it together ?
yeah , yeah .
okay , so if clair hit her mother with the field hockey stick ,
then we would &apos;ve found high velocity blood spatter .
we would expect to see a cast @-@ off pattern
on the wall and the floors ,
which is why i re @-@ examined all of the crime scene photos ,
but there weren &apos;t any .
because the blood on the wall was smeared .
and the pool of blood under the victim
obscured any pattern .
robert is either
the smartest criminal or the luckiest .
or he didn &apos;t do it .
look at these pictures .
his girlfriend died the exact same way 20 years ago ,
even down to the smeared blood on the walls .
mm , fair enough .
but if you take the girlfriend out of the equation ,
all of the physical and circumstantial evidence
points to clair .
you can &apos;t take the girlfriend out of the equation .
that &apos;s nuts .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
the girlfriend &apos;s case is not admissible .
unfortunately , the d.a. &apos; s decided we have enough evidence
to charge clair with murder .
no .
we &apos;ve been ordered to bring her in . come on , frank .
no , no , no . i &apos;ll do it . i &apos;ll do it .
go with her .
yeah .
what &apos;s going on ?
the d.a. has decided to charge you .
i don &apos;t understand .
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of michelle stevens .
y @-@ you said that you needed my help .
you said that i was doing the right thing for my mom .
and now you &apos;re arresting me ?
frankie ...
i &apos;m so sorry , clair .
you were right about robert .
i found something in the m.e. &apos; s autopsy report
on robert &apos;s seattle girlfriend .
the wound pattern and the stair matched perfectly .
but what the m.e. missed 20 years ago
was the force in which her head hit the stair .
that &apos;s why the police ruled the death accidental .
so he must &apos;ve pushed his girlfriend down the stairs
and then stood over , taken her head ,
and slammed it against the bottom step .
according to this case file , yes .
but our victim &apos;s head wound was so significant
that i couldn &apos;t conclusively match it to the stair
or the field hockey stick .
why use a field hockey stick
when he knew how to kill her with his bare hands ?
he didn &apos;t .
the field hockey stick isn &apos;t the murder weapon .
he just kept it so he could blame clair for the murder
if we didn &apos;t rule the death accidental .
so if he killed his wife
the same way he killed the girlfriend ,
the major thing that he had to clean up was the blood spatter .
that &apos;s why he smeared the wall .
and he knew that the pooling blood would obscure
the evidence on the floor .
that &apos;s right . but his shoes and his pants
had to have been covered in blood .
so he had to ditch his bloody clothes . but where ?
the only logical place
would be to dump the clothes at the storage unit .
we searched his unit . we didn &apos;t find anything .
then they &apos;re nearby .
come on .
nothing .
nothing .
hey ! hey . can i help you ?
bpd .
garbage was picked up yesterday .
does everyone know that ?
pickup schedule is posted on bulletin board .
he dumped it here because he knew it &apos;d be gone .
do you have people rummage through these dumpsters ?
yeah . they make a real mess .
hey , you remember the homeless guy
with the grocery cart full of cans ?

looking for some pants , shoes ?
i don &apos;t remember seeing that .
you sure ? i &apos;d give you 20 bucks for &apos; em .
i &apos;ll give you 30 .
i , uh , i came as soon as i got your message about clair .
but , um , how can i help her ?
you can take her place .
you remember these ?
never seen &apos; em before .
really ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s your wife &apos;s blood on the outside
and your dna on the inside .
