第四季 第二十集
I am Amanda Clarke.
"What kind of detective doesn't know the real name
the woman at he's been dating?"
The thing with Louise -- it's not a traditional marriage.
Then why lie to her?
Emily and Nolan are strangers to honesty.
There's so much more you don't know.
I want the truth.
I ran a diagnostic. Files were copied.
Do you have any idea what you've exposed me to?!
The whole world is dying to hear your story.
Victoria schemed, plotted, and railed
against me, my friends, and loved ones.
Amanda Clarke has dug a grave for me tonight.
This story will never end.
As if this last week hasn't been hard enough,
the press seems to have an insatiable appetite to eviscerate me.
Well, I'm doing everything I can to tell your side.
Ohh, it's merely screaming in the wind, Margaux.
But I hate seeing you endure these attacks.
It's too hard for anyone to bear, even you.
Which is why she has me.
What is she doing here?
I invited her.
Victoria, I beg you,
do not let that woman into your life.
Well, someone has to lighten the mood around here.
You're about as depressing as a yankee groom
at a southern wedding.
You tried to kill me, you lunatic.
Okay, whatever did or did not happen
was due to the fact that my family was drugging me.
Former family.
Victoria, please, you don't need her kind of help.
Oh, the hell she doesn't.
You have her holed up in here, hiding from the world.
That is not how you handle a scandal.
You face it with your head held high.
You do not act like a guilty person.
Oh, no, just like a crazy one.
Stop it!
If I am to survive this, I need both of you.
Now, can you do this for me or not?
Oh, Victoria, you know you will always have my support.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about that.
Sometimes, I just can't stop my lips from flapping.
Don't worry about Margaux.
She doesn't understand what it means
to be the target of ugly headlines.
And that's a club that both you and I have membership to.
And the last one that will ever have me, I'm sure.
That doesn't sound like the Victoria I know.
Louise. Perhaps you're right.
Maybe I have been hidden here for too long.
Would you please take me to lunch?
Oh, with head held high.
I heard you were doing this.
Wanted to pay my respects, but I-I didn't want to intrude.
I'm glad you're here.
For half her life, you were the only family Amanda had --
Emily had.
That's gonna get complicated.
You always had a way with understatements.
So, Stevie's changing Carl's birth certificate, too?
Yeah, yeah.
Once my mom gets an idea in her head, there's no stopping her.
She and your dad are meeting today.
Yeah, he told me.
I guess she needs him to legally verify that I'm me.
Right.
Complicated.
Well... it's all a good thing.
It's a chance to start living honestly.
Well, you were always better at that than me.
Maybe.
But now that this is over, there's nothing stopping you.
Almost over.
Victoria still has the drive with the evidence on me.
She hasn't made a move yet,
which means she's planning something.
I have Nolan tracking it.
Well, you guys will figure something out.
You always do.
Jack.
When I get this evidence back, I'm done...for good.
Thanks for coming today.
What about that one?
Not really my type.
That one is definitely mine.
Come on, Tony. You could totally rock an Asaf Ganot.
First off,
I can't believe that - I'm shopping at a runway show.
And, second, what's wrong with my suit?
You have to kind of trust me on this one.
You're already sponsoring my work's charity event.
That's huge.
And it's my pleasure.
If you want to raise money in the Hamptons,
you have to dress the part, sir.
I just don't like you buying me things, Nolan.
Okay... okay. Fine.
Look, we wear the same size.
I'll buy, you borrow.
Tony, your work's important, and, you know,
I want to be involved in some small way if I can.
Besides, it's, uh... it's nice to feel useful.
You haven't smoothed things over with Emily yet?
I mean, uh...
We've talked since our little dust-up, but, uh...
only about stuff, you know, that needs to be handled
since her coming-out party.
Everything is fixable.
That's actually debatable.
What's not debatable is that you guys are best friends
who aren't talking about anything real.
You need to air this out.
You so don't know Ems.
She's not a "share her feelings" kind of girl.
Then there's the problem. And I hate seeing you this way.
You're a great guy with a good heart,
which is the real reason I came today.
It wasn't for the suits.
You know, before lunch, we should stop at Tiffany's.
'cause nothing cures the blues like a little blue box.
The car's not here.
Oh, I'm sure they're just late.
This was a mistake.
Oh, no, you're just getting spooked.
Louise, would you find the car for me, please?
Sure.
Be back in two shakes.
Victoria!
Get her help! Call 911!
Oh, my god! Victoria! Are you okay?!
Did you see his face?
What is it?
It was Emily.
第四季 第二十集
Call me right away if you have any dizziness, Mrs. Grayson.
And watch your step. That was a nasty fall you took.
Well, that seems to be a recurring theme for me these days, doctor.
Thank you so much for your help.
You didn't tell him what happened?
I don't want to discuss it.
But Emily attacked you.
We don't know that for sure.
I may have been mistaken earlier.
It's the only thing that makes sense.
She's trying to steal back the evidence you have.
She didn't get it, did she?
No.
It's the only leverage I have left.
Well, it's only useful if you use it.
Louise, you don't understand.
I know what she's done to you,
and I know you must be scared.
But the police will believe you
once they see what's on that drive.
The truth is on your side, Victoria.
Why won't you use just it?
She wants me to try to use it
so she can take it away from me.
That's what she does.
She manipulates her targets before they realize it,
and then it's too late.
She's taken everything away from me
my son... his child, Charlotte.
She will not stop until I'm dead,
and I refuse to give her that satisfaction.
Margaux was right.
I should never have left this room.
Victoria.
Just go.
I knew you were out.
Just wanted to check your security program
to see if we located the drive.
Well, Victoria hasn't plugged it in in the last week.
Well, good news, she hasn't played that card.
Bad news, we still don't know where it is.
Okay.
Well, I'm sorry to intrude.
Good talk.
What do you want me to say, Nolan?
I don't know. Anything?
I don't want to fight.
I don't want to fight, either, but maybe we should,
because then at least I'd know how you feel.
You kept files without telling me,
and now Victoria has them.
This is my nightmare. How do you think I feel?
I know. I know.
I'm terrified that everything is about to come undone
because of me.
And trust me, Ems, that is my nightmare.
Because... this has been the best part of my life.
That's why I held onto that stuff.
It was my infinity box.
And it's why I still call you Ems
Even though the rest of the world knows your real name.
I hate that I failed you.
I don't want to lose you.
You know, sometimes, I'm so focused on the fight,
I don't see what's right in front of me.
I should have seen that you were hurting, too.
I mean, yeah, I'm pissed, but you're not gonna lose me.
We're a team.
We're gonna get through this, 'cause that's what we do.
Nice suit.
David.
Stevie.
We had an appointment, David. I waited an hour.
I called twice. What happened?
I guess my phone battery must have died.
I'm glad I tracked you down.
Before I leave tonight, I need all the documentation
regarding Carl's mother's name signed.
There's a lot of details that suddenly need to be rectified
in light of your daughter's announcement.
Wait, is that another attack on Amanda?
It's a legal observation.
Well, I don't appreciate it.
Believe me, David, I don't want to spend my last few hours
in town fighting with you again.
Don't, then. Just go.
This is important.
To you.
Not everything revolves around Stevie Grayson.
Where is this coming from?
Carl has lots of time to learn the truth.
Hell, up to a year ago, he would have
gotten his own grandmother's name wrong.
So just do us a favor... drop it.
I don't know what's causing you to act like this,
but it sure as hell isn't me.
Return these before I leave.
But after you deal with whatever it is
that's making you act like an ass.
This is good together.
That one over there, I think it's a mistake.
Yes. Thank you.
I got your message. You wanted to see me?
Oh, far from it,
but Victoria's current situation requires I do.
What will it take to make you go away?
Well, just a minute, now. You can't buy me off.
I do not like you, I do not trust you,
and I will do whatever it takes
to cut you out of Victoria's life
before your reckless behavior puts her in danger.
What happened? Tell me.
Victoria was attacked earlier.
Well, she said nothing to me.
Well, she's pretty shook up.
Truth be told, I figured that's why you called me here.
I thought you might be just as concerned as I was.
How did this happen? What did you do?
I thought I was helping.
It was Emily.
She's clearly trying to steal back that drive.
Yes, ma'am?
Simone, call my car.
And get me the number of that agent at the FBI... Agent Baker.
Victoria said she doesn't want to involve the feds.
No, I will decide what's best for her from now on.
Well, what can I do to help?
Stay out of my way.
Ben. Hi
Did you have a good swim?
Did a loop around Pennfeld.
Lighthouse? That's like three miles.
Helps me focus
when I'm dealing with a lot of things.
Three miles is a lot of things.
Given what went down with us,
you don't think maybe we need to talk about it?
Look, Ben, you don't know what I've been through,
What I'm going through.
You're right. I don't.
But I do know that I've put my career and my life
on the line for you...
because for reasons that I can't fathom right now,
I really like you, and I want us to work.
But if you don't, just be honest,
'cause I don't want to be that guy with you.
No, it's not that.
Look, it's that I don't want to be that girl with you.
And who's that?
Someone who puts you in a position
where you have to lie again,
especially when you're doing the job you've always wanted to do.
It's just... it's not fair.
Why don't you let me decide what's right for me?
I need to put all of this behind me first.
Can you give me a little more time?
All you had to do was ask.
I'm guessing I don't want to be here for that call.
Look, why don't you come back later?
We'll talk more then, okay?
Nolan, do you have something?
Things have gotten Harry... as in "S Truman."
They're about to drop the big one.
I intercepted a phone call between Margaux and Victoria.
They're using the evidence.
The Feds are on their way to Victoria's hotel.
It's going down now.
Margaux arranged for the FBI to question Victoria
at the penthouse.
It's a smart move on her part...
no chance for us to intercept them,
And she knows that we don't have enough time
to pull off an "Emily's eleven" and break into the suite.
Victoria won't let the drive out of her sight
long enough for us to take it, anyway.
Yeah, but we have to.
I mean, it's not like before. We can't erase it remotely.
And, Em, if the feds get their hands on this evidence, it --
We're not gonna let that happen, remember?
Is that what I asked for?
Yeah, graphite scanner, like the ones airports use
to search for chemical explosives.
I modified it to search for the coating agents
used on thumb-drive actuators.
Good. I better get moving.
I guess I'll call Tony
and, tell him I can't make it to the charity event.
No. I'll handle it.
I didn't mean it like that.
Look, the past few years, this has been our life.
Whether we want to admit it or not,
It's been easier to focus on the mission
than to think about what comes next.
Yeah, you're right.
I hate imagining life after Ems.
You don't have to.
There's always gonna be a "Nolan and Emily."
But "Nolan and Tony" might not have a chance
if you stand him up today, and I'd hate to see that happen.
I hear he's a really great guy.
Go finish this, Ems.
You never stop working.
Not when there's work to be done.
Listen, I, about that...
I brought the papers and an apology.
You were right. It wasn't about you.
I'm sorry.
Appreciate it.
Despite my reputation, I do know how to listen.
Want to talk about it?
It started that day, uh, on the boat, when I cut my hand.
At the hospital, they ran my blood work.
"It's a normal procedure," they said.
The tests, uh, they came back abnormal.
It's lymphoma.
Oh, David, I'm...
I'm so sorry.
Do they know...
The prognosis?
They said they got it in time, that they want to be aggressive.
I start chemo tonight.
Looks like that fight we had was a blessing in disguise.
How's your daughter taking it?
You haven't told her.
It was only confirmed this morning.
That's why I was in no state to make our meeting.
I'm gonna tell Amanda later.
I-I just... I don't know how she's gonna take it.
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
You have the toughest kid on the block.
Emily Thorne is no hero.
She is a criminal who thinks she's above the law.
When you say "Emily Thorne," You mean "Amanda Clarke," Correct?
By any name, she is a dangerous woman.
She attacked Victoria this morning.
So you said on the phone.
But when I checked with the doctor,
he told me that Mrs. Grayson claimed she fell.
Well, that was a cover story
to protect herself from retaliation.
Emily is a compulsive woman. She tapped phones.
She posed as a homeland security agent.
She threatened my father, and now he's dead because of it.
We cannot let her go on torturing us like this.
Mrs. Grayson, you provided vital evidence to the bureau
against your ex-husband in the past.
That's why I'm taking this as seriously as I am right now.
But I can't help you if you refuse to cooperate.
Victoria, we can end this.
Show him the evidence.
That's the fire alarm. We need to evacuate.
No, there is no fire. This is Emily.
She wants us out of this room.
You think I'm letting you stay up here based on your hunch?
Here.
Hold onto it, and don't let anybody near you.
Let's go, ladies.
Come on. We need to keep moving. Let's go.
I don't like being out in the open, Agent Baker.
She can get to us here.
Look, calm down, Mrs. Grayson.
I can assure you I have not seen her.
You don't understand.
She will take the evidence away from you.
I have it right here.
It's gone, isn't it?
I must have dropped it in the stairwell.
No, you didn't drop it.
It was Amanda Clarke, and we played right into her hands!
She took the evidence! She took it!
S-s-she knew you were coming. She tapped my phones.
She set off the alarm. D-don't you get it?
Amanda Clarke is here. Please, you got to find her.
You got to find her.
It's okay.
She's here!
Don't let her get away!
Victoria.
What?
We'll find her.
Ah, Amanda. Thanks for coming.
I wanted to talk to you.
Wait.
Something is different. What is it?
It's over.
What is?
Everything... this whole damn war.
Victoria was gonna use this today...
the last piece of leverage she had on me.
You know what this means?
Finishing this isn't just a fantasy. It happened...
today. I...
for the first time in my life,
there are no more battles to fight.
You wanted to talk to me?
I wanted to tell you I loved you
and that...
I am so very proud of you, Amanda.
It's a wonderful event, Mr. Ross.
Cheers.
What inspired you to do this for my star employee today?
Actually... I never really had a relationship with my father,
not a good one, anyway.
And as a result, I grew up an angry young man
who had his fair share of problems,
made mistakes, and...
until I met somebody who finally decided to believe in me.
David Clarke... I've heard you speak about him.
Changed my life, much like your program must do
for kids facing similar situations, problems.
That's why I decided to host this event.
Tony.
And we're very grateful for that.
And how did you two come to meet?
Oh, juicy question.
You want to field it, or should I?
Louise. What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm just contributing to the conversation.
My ex-husband here does weave such delightful tales,
doesn't he?
But I have to warn you, they are more fiction than fact.
And you will have to excuse my ex-wife.
She held so much promise... once.
What are you after?
You.
Now, we can do this right here
in front of your new paramour's employer,
or we could go someplace private and have a frank conversation.
You, me, outside, five minutes. Do not make a scene.
Now, why would I ever do that?
Oh, no, clumsy me.
And all over your brand-new Asaf Ganot suit,
which costs more than the donation I made
to your foundation earlier today.
You know, social work must be much more lucrative
than I was led to believe.
L-louise, stop it.
Unless... your foundation wasn't the sole beneficiary
of my ex-husband's charity.
Well, now I see why
you were so intent on getting a quickie divorce.
Good on you.
Wreck a marriage, get a sugar daddy.
Now, that's not true.
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
You know, I didn't think that you were a lost cause until right now.
Tony was an innocent in all this.
How could you do that to him?
You hurt my friends, I hurt yours.
Oh, listen to you... considering Victoria a friend
and taking a page out of her playbook?
More like Emily, if you ask me.
Hey, she never went after anybody that did not deserve it.
Oh, don't romanticize her!
She gets off on torturing Victoria,
just like she did today in that garage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, more lies!
I know you helped her steal that drive back,
and I know that this charade of an event is your alibi.
Plausible deniability while Emily does her dirty work.
Oh, wow, you're good, except for those pesky details.
Oh, don't stand there and play dumb.
You are kicking Victoria while she's down.
What do you think that will do to her?
Why don't you just be a man and admit to what you've done?
Louise, you're in over your head,
and you picked the wrong side.
Oh, and while you were trying to record a confession
on your phone right now,
I was running an app that reset it to factory settings.
Like I said...you, head, over.
轻触以开始
Up the hill.
You want me to do this side?
Here we go. Here we go.
This goes up.
Look here.
All this just to change a mother's name, huh?
You're lucky you get the family discount.
I usually charge by the pound.
Well, thanks for taking care of all this.
Maybe I should stick around.
Oh, you don't need to worry about me.
It's not worry. I just...
...I really treasure this time with you and Carl,
and I've missed so much.
Missed.
I'm not gonna be around forever.
Let me see.
Oh, not again. Choo-choo.
Where's this coming from?
I guess I just hate goodbyes.
Well, yeah, so do I.
So I get to be an annoying mother for another few hours.
Here.
What's next? You quit the force.
You can't work at that club forever.
You know what you want?
Actually, yeah.
For the first time in a while, I think I do.
Don't worry, Margaux. I'll be fine.
You shouldn't wait for your bodyguard alone.
Come here.
Don't worry about me so much.
I trust you were able to get what I was asking for?
Yes, ma'am.
She was definitely of a mind-set to sell, too.
Well, of course she was.
It lost its appeal due to Emily's televised assassination.
You mind me asking why getting this was so important to you?
It's a memento...
of a bygone era.
This is way more than we agreed to.
That's because we won't be seeing each other again,
Mr. Renner.
Mrs. Grayson, what do you plan to do?
Something Amanda Clarke never had the courage to do herself...
End this.
Do you want another drink? 'cause I want 12.
Party didn't go like you planned?
Why do we even still throw them?
No, no, no, seriously. No learning curve.
I mean, I just watched Tony leave with his boss,
who was not happy, so...that's over.
Where is my barkeep?
I have sorrows to drown. Miguel!
I asked Miguel to grab my last paycheck.
Sorry to see you go, Jack. Stay in touch.
Absolutely. Thank you.
Last paycheck?
After all the trouble I went to setting up that daycare,
it would have been nice to get two weeks' notice, my friend.
That's actually why I'm here.
I'm not just quitting, Nolan. I'm...I'm leaving.
Okay. W-where are you going?
Los Angeles. I'm...taking Carl tonight.
And once we get set up there, I'm selling the house here.
I'm gonna start fresh.
Wait. I... h-have you talked to Emily?
There's nothing left to say, Nolan.
I told her how I felt.
She made it clear - she didn't want to be with me.
Look, it's time I faced reality.
She never wanted me to be a part of this, anyway.
Only because she was protecting you.
She loves you, Jack.
I can't hear that right now.
And I certainly didn't hear it from her.
We both know that what Emily says and what Emily feels
are two very different things.
Yes, we do.
But this morning at the cemetery,
I realized something else.
Emily's never gonna stop.
She can't.
This life, it's all she's known.
And, you know, maybe it... maybe it started out
as some way to keep her father alive
when she thought she'd lost him,
but it's turned into something else,
something that she either can't let go of...
or doesn't want to.
Don't do this, Jack.
Please.
Look, things... things will be different
now that she can be Amanda.
I mean, my god, just give her one more chance.
No. I told her I wouldn't wait.
I'm asking you as a friend...
don't ever tell me that she loves me again.
I'll call you when I get to L.A.
I wanted to see you before I left.
How did today go?
Uh, I-I didn't tell her.
I couldn't. She was so happy.
For 20 years, that was all I ever dreamed of.
How was I supposed to ruin that moment?
You know, since being back, uh...I always thought
that I'd been given a new lease on life.
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe it was all just a long setup to a sick joke.
That's a load of bull.
You didn't fight to survive that hell
just to be fate's punch line.
You're here for a reason, David.
You may not believe it now, but you will,
which is why you need to keep fighting.
Take this.
It's the number for a friend of mine
who happens to be the best oncologist you'll ever meet.
首席临床肿瘤学家
What's the other number?
Mine.
You're not doing this alone.
Emily!
I've been calling you.
Why didn't you pick up?
My phone was off.
What's wrong?
Jack's leaving.
What do you mean, "Leaving"?
Right now. He's leaving town for good.
But...well, he didn't say anything.
Well, why would he? He's already said everything.
I mean, did you really tell him
that you didn't want to be with him?
I said that I can't be with him.
Listen to yourself, Ems.
How many times did you think you could push him away
before he finally broke?
What was I supposed to do, Nolan?
You know how much - he's suffered because of me.
And still he chose you.
He loves you, Ems.
He had the guts to open his heart.
Can you?
Honestly, do you even know what you really want?
All right, well, let me help you out,
because sometimes it's hard to see
what's right in front of your eyes.
The only thing stopping you from choosing Jack is you.
I know.
But I don't deserve him!
But you deserve me?
Ben, I'm sorry.
Why, because I finally heard the truth?
Look, this is so much more complica...
Will you talk to me like a person, please?
I feel like I've earned at least that much.
Do you want this to work or not?
Well, I guess there's our answer.
Ben, wait.
What?
The truth's out, Emily.
You were just hiding with me. You weren't living.
And deep down, I knew it...
But I guess I didn't want to face reality, either.
Jack's flight leaves in 20 minutes.
If you want to stop him,
you need to make your decision right now.
You sure about this? No regrets?
No, no regrets.
That makes me happy, Jack.
Hey, Carl! Carl!
Wait for me.
Let's go on the plane.
Let's do this.
I didn't get a chance to see you at the club before I left.
Well, after the destruction caused by hurricane Louise,
I...I didn't think I'd be seeing you again ever.
It's your suit, remember?
Look, I know you... you're mad.
I mean, you have every right to be.
I hosted the worst fundraiser ever
and ruined your relationship with...
Hey, hey, hey, slow down.
Look, today didn't go as planned, no question,
and I do have some damage control to do with my boss.
But we still raised money for the kids.
That's the important thing.
Huh. I assumed you'd be pissed.
I was, but not at you.
Louise is a lunatic, but she was a sideshow.
The main event was you,
a man trying to do something good, not... not destructive.
And despite her worst intentions, you succeeded.
This is not at all
how I imagined this conversation was gonna go.
Usually,
my friends start uncapping the red sharpie
right about now.
Maybe it's time
you started looking at life from a different perspective.
Because from this view, it looks pretty great.
I've never met anyone like you.
Now you have.
I didn't know where else to go.
I can't get ahold of Victoria, and I'm worried about her.
I know. Me too.
I was with her earlier.
She seemed so different... defeated.
And you left her?
Well, she was with her bodyguard.
I made her promise to call me tomorrow.
Something is not right with her.
I feel so helpless.
I tried to get Nolan to admit
that he and Emily were behind the whole thing today, but...
Oh, they're too clever to fall for that.
But they will make a mistake,
and we will be there to catch them.
We?
I can get past our history...
If you can... for Victoria.
I hope she's all right tonight.
You missed your flight.
Seeing that look on your face
almost makes the past year worthwhile,
the key word being "Almost."
What are you doing here, Mason?
We had a deal.
Yes, we did.
And I was waiting patiently, typing away on my magnum opus...
"The secret origin of Emily Thorne."
So imagine my surprise
when I caught - your heartfelt performance,
announcing to all the world that very same story...
my story.
I had no choice. Everything changed.
Yes, everything but you.
Which I suppose is just now starting to become apparent,
standing there alone on the tarmac,
realizing that while you hid behind your mission of revenge,
everyone else around you evolved.
Did you really think they'd wait forever,
sacrificing everything and getting nothing in return?
Did you honestly believe
that you'd get your "Happily ever after"
After so many lies - to so many different people...
until all you had left were enemies?
Like the little pyromaniac that you are, you started a fire
and convinced yourself that you could contain it.
But I know your dirty little secret.
You can't exist without revenge.
The endless cycle of hate, it's your addiction.
And like all tales of compulsion,
this will end the same way.
First you will crash...
...and then you will burn.
