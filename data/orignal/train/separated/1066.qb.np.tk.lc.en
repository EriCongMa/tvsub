this is a good office .
but the one next door has a much nicer view .
the asac &apos;s office ?
they want me to run white collar division ?
what &apos;s the gold for , hagen ?
why &apos;s that matter to you ?
because i can tell when i &apos;ve stepped into a trap .
my appeal &apos;s coming up .
you &apos;re gonna help set me free .
hey , boss .
diana .
look at you .
it &apos;s a boy .
you &apos;re choosing someone from outside the office
to be my new handler .
someone who will see you as you are .
a criminal .
bang . you &apos;re dead .
since when do surveillance cameras go &quot; bang &quot; ?
oh , since when do you overstep your mark ?
take it easy , bob fosse .
you know , anxiety doesn &apos;t become you .
i &apos;m gonna get it .
i only had 20 feet to go this time .
at this point , 20 feet
might as well be hannibal &apos;s march .
hyperbolize much ?
i am serious .
hagen &apos;s bonds will be in the fbi &apos;s evidence lockup in three days .
if one of those cameras spots you , you are toast .
if you &apos;re aiming to reduce my anxiety ,
i &apos;m not the only one missing my mark .
i am just trying to make your anxiety
appropriately focused .
you &apos;re not the one getting a new handler .
you know , i think that &apos;s for the best .
we &apos;ve become way too chummy with these g @-@ men .
maybe a new handler will remind us
why snakes don &apos;t fraternize with mongeese .
mongeese ?
mongooses ?
that &apos;s why i always go with scorpions and frogs .
how we doing on the spanish victory bonds ?
the bonds have to look
as if they have deteriorated naturally ,
so i &apos;m hoping we can induce photolysis .
ultraviolet light .
yeah .
i came up with the idea while i was sunning .
the radiation source has to be very strong .
but if it is , the bonds should wilt
like a newspaper left out in the sun .
like an inadmissible newspaper .
what &apos;s our light source ?
that is my problem .
you--you have footwork to master .
back to one .
shouldn &apos;t your mug say &quot; world &apos;s greatest asac &quot; now ?
figured i ought to serve out my first week before i make that claim .
world &apos;s greatest aspiring asac ?
you &apos;re late .
we usually just hang out
and drink coffee for the first half hour .
we do not hang out and drink coffee .
well , today , we have work .
i made the call .
jones arrested brendan holland this morning .
three @-@ time holland ? the greytrade guy ?
if we already arrested him , why call in the cavalry ?
if you were on time , you &apos;d know .
hey , uh , my new handler ,
is he in there ?
you &apos;re getting a new handler today ?
yeah , he &apos;s in there .
so ?
so what ?
so what &apos;s he like ?
probably late @-@ middle aged , curmudgeonly ,
prefers sportscenter to masterpiece theatre .
curmudgeonly ?
uh , did i nail it ?
you &apos;re an expert on handlers .
i &apos;ll let you figure it out .
guys , we &apos;re low on man power ,
so it &apos;s only four to a team , okay ?
so keep your wits about you .
agent berrigan will coordinate from here .
targets will be prioritized
by threat level and estimated seizure value .
ideally , we &apos;ll synchronize our arrests .
who are we arresting ?
debrief started 15 minutes ago .
consultants make their own hours .
no , they don &apos;t .
some of them do .
this morning , we brought in brendan &quot; three @-@ time &quot; holland .
holland operates--
greytrade.com , yeah .
it &apos;s the black market equivalent of ebay .
that &apos;s-- that &apos;s all i know . you can keep going .
oh , no , like you said ,
greytrade is an online marketplace
that has damn near every contraband imaginable .
thank you . diana ?
yeah , we &apos;re looking at stolen credit card numbers ,
counterfeit passports , missing artwork .
is that a slow loris ?
caffrey , have you seen my stomach ?
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s a trick question .
i &apos;m eight months pregnant .
i &apos;m not eating or sleeping well ,
so i &apos;m in no mood .
so i &apos;ll keep my interruptions to a minimum .
got it . it is cute , though .
the slow loris .
and it &apos;s endangered .
look , guys , simply shutting down greytrade
was a big win for the bureau .
we have an opportunity to make it even bigger .
we &apos;re going to arrest the sellers .
we can track their ips throuch the site ,
which means we know where they live .
and we have dossiers made up ,
but once these guys notice ,
that the site has been decommissioned ,
they &apos;re gonna close up shop .
that &apos;s why , even shorthanded ,
we &apos;re gonna hammer as many as we can today .
i swear to god , caffrey , what ?
if the bureau keeps greytrade up and running for a few days ,
we can take our time and bust all of them .
can &apos;t concede the sale of illegal goods ,
even in the short term .
we don &apos;t necessarily have to concede anything .
really ?
well , we &apos;re all ears .
do you want to explain ?
no , please .
we drum up fake user names ,
then outbid everyone else .
since the plan is to arrest them anyway ,
the bureau won &apos;t be on the hook for the payout .
be a lot of work . it &apos;s not a bad idea .
thanks for the assist .
guess i was wrong about curmudgeonly .
i &apos;m sorry ?
what ?
oh , it doesn &apos;t matter .
neal caffrey .
you must be my new handler .
must be .
neal , special agent david siegel .
how old are you ?
i &apos;m 31 , but don &apos;t read into it .
agent siegel was a top graduate at quantico
and served as supervisor
in the chicago white collar division
for the past two years .
actually , almost three , sir .
windy city division had a work @-@ release c.i. too .
modeled his deal after yours , neal .
siegel was his handler .
they had a closure rate in the 70s .
nice rates . why come to new york ?
70s are nice . 80s are better .
87 .
right ?
i wanna work with you , neal .
hey , you &apos;re the best there is .
your skills are unmatched .
and your smarts are unparalleled .
you might be the most valuable asset the fbi has .
might be .
all right , that &apos;s enough .
do you prefer david or dave ?
i &apos;d like to speak to this agent privately .
it &apos;s easier for me if i know--
go .
okay .
good to meet you .
shut the door .
all right .
as our new supervisor ,
i was gonna give you my old office .
oh . thank you , sir .
but you &apos;re not the right man for the job .
i &apos;m sorry ?
neal caffrey is a confidence man .
he preys on trust , desire , and impressionability .
the last thing he needs is a lapdog as a handler .
i &apos;m no lapdog , sir .
sure as hell fooled me .
well , i &apos;m hoping i fooled him too .
one thing i learned about c.i.s like neal :
they like smoke ,
and i know exactly where to blow it .
you were playing him ?
i was handling him .
start moving in tomorrow .
gotta tell ya , i really like this new kid .
he &apos;s smart , hardworking , intuitive .
he loves you , huh ?
well , that doesn &apos;t hurt .
how &apos;s neal ?
neal ?
you got promoted , and he has a new handler .
it &apos;s been a big change for him too .
you haven &apos;t talked to him yet , have you ?
oh , we talk . yeah , of course we talk .
i should reach out to him .
yeah .
okay .
uh , but , hon ?
hmm ?
in the morning .
me ?
black , right ?
when it &apos;s good , yeah .
are you following me ?
oh , i don &apos;t need to follow you .
you &apos;re wearing a tracking anklet .
we hadn &apos;t talked in a while .
just a friendly coffee @-@ chat @-@ and @-@ walk @-@ to @-@ the @-@ office thing ?
yeah .
i can handle that .
any reason i might be following you ?
aside from that you &apos;ve been following me
for almost a decade ?
aside from that .
i don &apos;t think your new title calls for legwork .
no , i guess not .
so ... how was day number one ?
with siegel ?
yeah .
he reminds me of one of the von trapp children ,
and he &apos;s a little overeager ,
but for the most part , i like him .
i mean , he &apos;s intelligent , capable , self @-@ aware .
he loves you , huh ?
i know when someone is playing to my vanity , okay ?
but the fact is he came to new york for a reason .
you are one hell of an informant .
i &apos;m usually just following your lead .
it &apos;s good you like him .
yeah , as long as things with us are--
normal ?
yeah , yeah .
i might have a different title ,
but i &apos;m still the same old me .
me too .
maybe i should be following you .
diana ...
what do you want ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m multi @-@ geeking .
in addition to posing as three @-@ time holland ,
i &apos;m balancing chats and auctions
under 40 separate nyms .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
multi @-@ geeking is when you operate
more than one computer ,
and a nym is a pseudonym ,
avatar , user name , whatever .
did you spend the night here ?
three @-@ time never slept before .
he can &apos;t start now .
and you &apos;re drinking coffee .
what are you , my obstetrician ?
it &apos;s herbal tea .
if you wanna take a break , i can get someone--
i &apos;m not trusting this to some n.f.g.
you wanna help ? pull up a chair .
yes . yes , sure .
yeah , we will . let &apos;s--
guys , guys , i got something .
oh , gotta go . that &apos;s my handler .
good luck with that .
i gotta go .
thank you . seriously , thank you .
yeah , too much herbal tea .
you choose a target ?
well , i &apos;m digging through the greytrade files ,
and i settle on this one : little star merchandise .
little star ?
yeah . you know it ?
can &apos;t say i do .
these guys are definitely selling .
must be millions in looted art and antiquities .
yeah , little star &apos;s our diamond in the rough here .
wait , guys ,
shouldn &apos;t we go after someone more dangerous ?
an arms dealer , maybe ?
are you kidding me ?
this thing is right in your wheelhouse .
yeah , look , they have faberge eggs .
oh , peter , you know me so well .
you want little star ? it &apos;s yours .
i &apos;d give you a team ...
but you &apos;re already shorthanded .
i know . i know .
it &apos;s all right , me and neal , we can manage alone , right ?
yeah . i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll manage .
on the surface , little star is
a thriving importer of antiques and old world curio .
but if these greytrade sales lists are legit--
he &apos;s selling a lot more than trinkets and baubles .
he ?
english doesn &apos;t have a gender @-@ neutral singular pronoun .
you think behind those crates are
a 13x19 @-@ foot jan matejko battle scape ,
a bohemian crystal chandelier ,
and a &quot; strongbox of portuguese dobrao &quot; ?
and two imperial faberge eggs .
where do you even find these things ?
europe in the &apos; 40s .
look , if this stuff isn &apos;t in there
and we start flashing badges--
yeah , we &apos;re gonna spook &apos; em .
yeah .
what are you thinking ?
i go in as a designer ,
argue that i had an appointment .
i &apos;ll check the place out
while they &apos;re showing off the wares .
what am i doing ?
peter wouldn &apos;t have passed for a designer ,
but you actually could .
we could be associates .
great .
assuming you can speak from a place of education
on islamic influence in silk road ceramics .
silk road .
don &apos;t worry about it .
how about i go in first ,
and i &apos;ll pull you in once i &apos;ve checked the place out
and confirmed it &apos;s legit ?
okay . all right .
neal , be careful .
this is not an arms dealer ,
but we still don &apos;t know who we &apos;re up against , right ?
right .
hey , we gotta get you out of here .
neal , i repurposed a uv inductor
from a tanning bed .
perfect radiation . bye @-@ bye , victory bonds .
shouldn &apos;t you be at work ?
i am at work .
my new handler is looking for the proprietor
of little star merchandise .
oh , the persian rug sale .
no , moz , he &apos;s here to arrest you .
you don &apos;t have a contingency plan ?
i have contingency plans .
what do you think i &apos;m doing ?
i don &apos;t know , some last @-@ minute filing ?
how could you bring him here ?
i didn &apos;t bring anyone here .
the bureau cracked greytrade .
i knew when those pencil necks
at ucla invented the internet
that i would end up like a trapped rat .
mozzie , i &apos;m gonna get you out of here ,
but i need you to breathe .
i can &apos;t breathe .
i refuse to breathe .
i am enacting the roanoke praxis .
what &apos;s the roanoke praxis ?
my ultimate disappearing act .
are those--
my teeth , yes .
how did you-- actually , no .
i don &apos;t wanna know .
why are your teeth in a plastic bottle ?
oh , my god , it burns !
they have to find something in the fire .
watch this .
are you crazy ?
this is awesome .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m cancelling the roanoke praxis .
what the hell ?
does your other contingency plan
involve burning anything down ?
not as such .
then we &apos;re going with that one .
now , gather up your teeth , and get out .
and leave the tomatoes .
hey , it says &quot; by appointment only . &quot;
can you read ?
you hear the fire alarm ?
i &apos;m a federal agent . i &apos;m coming in .
what the hell , neal ?
maybe i got made .
can you cut that off , please ?
now , i &apos;m under the impression that neal caffrey
doesn &apos;t get made .
if you had something to do with this , neal , i swear--
look , i can assure you , blaring alarms are not my style .
hey . stop !
persian rug sale ?
get your hands up .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
oh , tell that to emile berliner .
man , he &apos;s fast .
wouldn &apos;t have thought the little guy had it in him .
should we split up ?
no , no , no .
he &apos;s gone .
any idea who emile berliner is ?
couldn &apos;t even venture a guess .
he was just burning documents in here .
we had our chance , and we missed him .
not necessarily .
anything ?
there &apos;s life , but not much .
do you think we &apos;ll be able to--
oh , i doubt it .
between the fire damage and the encryption ,
it &apos;s like digging through lasagna .
let me take a shot at it .
i have some computer forensics experience .
computer forensics . how fortunate .
i &apos;ll take this in my office .
we lost little star ?
he had some kind of escape plan .
did you get a visual ?
short , balding , bespectacled .
tell me you &apos;re joking .
short , bald guy with prewar treasure .
diana , sound like somebody we know ?
what ?
never mind .
agent burke ,
you think we have a positive i.d on this little star ?
ask neal .
i have a friend who fits the bill ,
and agent burke is jumping to conclusions .
look , whoever he is , we saw him .
you can sketch him , right ?
oh , shouldn &apos;t be a problem .
good .
that &apos;s little star ?
and i think we can both agree
it looks nothing likes mozzie .
i want siegel to confirm .
no problem .
satisfied ?
pictures don &apos;t lie .
it &apos;s one hell of a coincidence .
farsightedness and male @-@ pattern baldness
are epidemic , peter .
peter , you have a minute ?
sure , come on in .
get that to siegel .
excuse me .
we have to talk about diana .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m gonna pull her out .
oh , i don &apos;t think you should .
i mean , you &apos;ve already taken her off fieldwork .
oh , she &apos;s eight months pregnant .
and about to pop , but she says she &apos;s fine .
she &apos;s been camped out in the conference room for two days .
running a city @-@ wide operation .
jones , i can &apos;t put her or her baby at risk
just because she wants to close the book on greytrade .
look , peter , i &apos;m no psychologist ,
but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s about this case .
i mean , she &apos;s staring down the barrel at diana berrigan , single mother , and that &apos;s scary .
but i think the idea of her losing diana berrigan , special agent--
i just think that &apos;s scarier .
she knows she always has a place here .
but does she ?
i mean , you were talking about
taking her off casework because she &apos;s tired .
and are you really gonna feel good about sending her on a raid
when she &apos;s got a kid at home ?
look , you &apos;re the boss now . it &apos;s a tough call .
i get the position you &apos;re in .
i &apos;m just saying
i get the position she &apos;s in too .
you know , if you &apos;re bored ,
i &apos;m sure berrigan could use your help .
nope , i &apos;m not bored .
does the name teddy winters mean anything to you ?
never heard of him .
mm , maybe teddy winters is little star .
let &apos;s see what we got on him .
where are you , teddy ?
bingo . prints , dental records , bank accounts .
photograph ?
no , doesn &apos;t look like it .
teddy winters is on the grid but only barely .
anything actionable ?
not yet .
were you followed ?
oh , god .
the fbi shuts down little star ,
and this is your alternative revenue stream ?
this is my camouflage ,
security through obscurity .
not sure that principle applies here .
says you . plus i made $ 11.50 .
75 .
high roller .
listen , with all the heat here in new york ,
i &apos;m thinking of catching a train down to miami .
you can stick around a little longer .
i managed to steer peter off the scent .
oh , a slight reprieve . and little star ?
siegel did salvage your laptop .
that &apos;s why you can &apos;t prematurely extinguish the roanoke praxis .
all he found was an alias .
oh , well , aliases are a dime a dozen .
so which one of my noms de guerre am i retiring ?
i think it &apos;s from before i knew you .
teddy winters ?
they found me .
oh , i &apos;m sorry ,
that wasn &apos;t clear when you were being held at gunpoint ?
no , you don &apos;t understand . they found me .
so you stay out of the light and burn an alias .
it &apos;s hardly defcon one .
teddy winters isn &apos;t an alias , neal .
you mean ...
exactly .
babies in baskets rarely arrive with birth certificates .
i was no exception .
i was homeless , nameless , purposeless .
histrionic .
you &apos;ll never really understand
the plight of the orphaned ,
not truly .
if you showed up without a name ,
where did teddy winters come in ?
oh , well , once i got old enough ,
i struck out to uncover my origins .
i started at the wayne county clerk &apos;s office .
you were checking birth certificates ?
every boy in or around detroit
born a month prior to my abandonment .
and that &apos;s where you found teddy winters .
yeah , his was the only certificate
unaccounted for .
every other baby boy had either a body or a grave .
you do look like a teddy .
frankly , i prefer theodore .
good to know .
that name is tied to everything , neal .
my storehouses , my safe houses ,
my traditional houses .
if they have teddy , they have it all .
why keep it active after all this time ?
just in case my parents came looking .
if you let teddy die , no one would ever find him .
including the fbi .
mozzie , i hate to say this ,
but i think you might have had the right idea earlier .
train to miami ?
no . the roanoke praxis .
you still have those teeth ?
can we trade jobs ?
nope .
are you sure ?
i &apos;m sure .
i &apos;m not the one who thinks my teeth
need a different host .
well , they do .
you &apos;re not usually this squeamish .
well , pulling my own teeth is one thing , but a dead man &apos;s ?
on the off chance that there actually is a heaven ,
this is definitely gonna get me barred .
i think we took heaven off the table a long time ago , mozzie .
fine , i &apos;ll go to the morgue ,
but i &apos;m doing this under protest .
duly noted .
i &apos;ll meet you back here in half an hour with the combustibles .
great , whatever you get ,
just make sure it makes a loud boom .
i can do that .
you &apos;re here early .
i wanna keep on top of teddy winters .
i &apos;ve been going over this guy &apos;s assets ,
and there &apos;s not a lot here ,
but i did find that .
an account in the caymans .
looks like a shell company ,
offshore laundry maybe .
i don &apos;t think so .
when shells launder money ,
corporate profits are all over the map .
these earnings are pretty regular .
you &apos;re right , it &apos;s a holding company .
question is , what is teddy winters holding ?
seriously ? gasoline and styrofoam ?
don &apos;t you think homemade napalm
is a bit vulgar for teddy &apos;s final au revoir ?
you said you wanted a loud boom , moz .
beggars can &apos;t be choosers .
oh , common misconception .
if you had spent any significant time beggaring--
really ?
fine .
napalm , but i will remember this
next time we fake your death .
fair enough .
mr. walinski .
going out of business sale ,
suits . come and get it .
right there , if you start with those three
and just see where it goes .
we work our way ,
it &apos;d take us a month
just to work through long island .
hey , hey . we broke it .
teddy winters ?
yeah . we found a holding company out of the caymans .
it &apos;s pegged to properties all over the city .
this guy has got an empire ,
and we &apos;re gonna take it down .
he won &apos;t have anything left .
that &apos;s the point .
now come on . we &apos;re gonna go to a loft in soho .
right now ?
yeah , right now . hell , yeah . come on , let &apos;s go .
boss .
yeah ?
there &apos;s activity on the little star ip address .
the usage is erratic , but someone &apos;s definitely home .
it &apos;s gotta be winters .
the idiot went back ?
so that &apos;s where we &apos;re gonna go .
peter , come . nail this guy with us . come on .
asac . i &apos;ve got responsibilities here .
we won &apos;t let you down .
flank the building .
i want a team out back covering every window .
go .
roger that .
wait , wait , wait . why is he wearing a gas mask ?
took the fire department six hours to put it out .
let me get this straight .
teddy winters returns to a crime scene ,
risks exposure , so he can , what ,
burn down a building he knows we already found ?
if you saw this guy ,
you would know that he has severe mental issues .
the fact is we watched him walk in the warehouse
with our own eyes .
how about the body ?
jones just called in from forensics .
the teeth we found are a match
for the records of teddy winters .
did i miss something ?
teddy winters is gone . we closed the case .
why aren &apos;t we happy ?
this is why we &apos;re the federal agents ,
and you &apos;re the criminal informant .
it &apos;s a win when the bad guy is in cuffs , neal ,
not when he &apos;s a briquette in a burned @-@ out building .
and what if he faked his death ?
you weren &apos;t there . that dental is irrefutable .
it &apos;s not hard to lose teeth .
give me a brick , and i &apos;ll show you .
diana , how long have you been awake ?
a while .
go home , get some sleep .
boss .
that &apos;s an order .
you two ,
i want reports on my desk before you leave .
caffrey .
let me ask you something .
if you were gonna fake your own death ,
how would you do it ?
i always liked the idea
of jumping off a bridge .
you still hung up on teddy winters ?
hey , do you wanna go back to that warehouse with me ?
take a look ?
no , peter told you to go home .
are you suggesting we disregard direct orders
from the assistant special agent in charge ?
are you suggesting we follow them ?
things really are changing around here , huh ?
look , i have to finish this ,
but if you wanna visit little star tomorrow ,
i &apos;m in .
thanks , caffrey .
this is agent berrigan , federal bureau .
i &apos;m looking at three manholes maybe 6 feet apart .
you guys at sanitation wanna tell me
which one doesn &apos;t belong ?
yeah ?
do i give this to siegel , or ...
i &apos;ll take it .
it &apos;s been a long day , peter .
you mind if i head home ?
curtis hagen is back .
yeah ?
they shipped his evidence over here
from long @-@ term storage this morning .
i guess an appellate court granted him a new trial .
that was our first case .
yeah . seems like forever ago .
you &apos;re not the one counting the days left on your sentence .
touche .
a retrial , huh ?
think he has a chance ?
no .
all the proof of his guilt is upstairs .
just thought you should know .
have a good night , peter .
you too .
mozzie ?
lady suit .
this isn &apos;t what it looks like .
it looks like you &apos;re teddy winters .
and if i am ?
then you &apos;re under arrest .
oh , then i &apos;m definitely not .
stand up .
can i ask you what you &apos;re never supposed to ask a woman ?
shut up and stand up .
it used to be having a gun trained on me was a rarity .
yeah , come on , teddy .
i actually prefer theodore .
oh , oh , are--are you okay ?
walk , mozzie .
you know , stress and physical exertion
can prematurely ind-- -
uh , c @-@ c @-@ can you make it up the ladder ?
you &apos;re gonna have to help me .
i &apos;m not going to prison .
mozzie !
mozzie !
we &apos;re 100 feet underground .
you &apos;re not gonna get any reception .
oh , you came back .
you may be the enemy ,
but bad karma isn &apos;t hereditary .
what does that mean ?
things are about to get messy .
your contractions are 90 seconds apart .
we don &apos;t have time to get you to a hospital .
this can &apos;t be happening .
i @-@ i know this venue is in @-@ ideal .
take your hands off me !
look at me . look at me .
this thing is coming out whether you like it or not .
now , you can let the expert work his magic ,
or you can take your chances alone--up to you .
i don &apos;t want you touching--
oh , get him out of me !
good choice .
evidence lockup .
hello ?
yeah ?
where should i put this ?
on this never @-@ ending stack i call my inbox .
everything all right ?
no , sir .
no , i @-@ i really fouled this case up ,
and i @-@ i @-@ i wanna apologize to you .
stop . we lost our guy ,
but you did good work .
don &apos;t beat yourself up .
yes , sir . thank you .
sit down .
how &apos;s it working with neal ?
as far as i can tell , good .
you think he had anything to do
with this teddy winters fiasco ?
i don &apos;t know .
first time we went to see little star , he--
something wasn &apos;t sitting right .
but today , caffrey was with me all day .
yeah , well , he &apos;s always smiling at you
right when things go backwards .
my c.i. in chicago was the same way .
how was it ,
passing him off to a new handler ?
i didn &apos;t have to .
i caught him forging illinois state lottery tickets .
you sent him back to prison .
that &apos;s the job .
that is the job .
yeah .
well , neal &apos;s ankle bracelet says
he &apos;s still in the building right now .
should i be worried about that ?
i would save your worries for when he &apos;s not in the building .
will do .
sir .
yeah ?
good night .
good night .
good . good .
good .
oh , here it comes .
okay .
peter . hey .
hey .
i saw you called .
is everything okay ?
yeah , i thought you were going home .
you know , i @-@ i made it all the way down the stairs
before i remembered .
you forgot your hat .
it needs its own tracking anklet .
i &apos;ll set one aside for you .
sounds good . see you tomorrow .
take care .
diana .
caffrey .
i &apos;m a dad .
not even close .
i &apos;m a midwife .
what the hell ...
el .
peter ?
yup .
oh , honey .
come on . we gotta go .
no , i just got here .
didn &apos;t you get my message ?
no . there was a fire .
then neal forgot his hat .
his hat ? honey , you gotta get up .
come on .
what &apos;s going on ?
we gotta get to the hospital .
the hospital ?
what &apos;s going on at the hospital ?
diana , he is so beautiful .
yep , you &apos;ve really outdone yourself this time .
thank you , guys , for being here .
look at him . he has little ears .
what exactly were you expecting , suit ?
what are you even doing here ?
he &apos;s all right .
you know , since christie and i broke up ,
i don &apos;t have a lot of family .
you guys are it , even him somehow .
little man have a name ?
clinton maybe ?
you know , i was thinking theo .
as in theodore winters ?
yeah , i guess .
must have been floating around my head .
wait , wait , you named him after a criminal ?
i mean , no offense to present company .
none taken .
oh , i think it &apos;s beautiful .
it &apos;s very noble .
regal , even .
so how long you gonna be out of the office ?
as long as it takes .
promise me that you will take your time .
i promise .
i haven &apos;t slept in a couple of days .
i think that &apos;s our cue .
okay .
the nurse said that you had him before you got here .
yeah , i went into labor early .
you did it all on your own ?
no . someone helped me ,
someone i didn &apos;t know .
who was it ?
never got a name .
doesn &apos;t seem like justice is being served .
to not know who to thank , i mean .
yeah .
maybe i &apos;ll try to track him down once i &apos;m back on my feet .
yeah .
that might be a good idea .
good night , mama .
it &apos;s poetic , you know .
one teddy dies . another is born .
maybe he &apos;ll call me &quot; papa &quot; or &quot; papoose . &quot;
&quot; papoose &quot; would be good .
i think you &apos;re gonna be disappointed on that one .
it feels odd to be once and for all truly nameless .
that which we call a rose , moz .
teddy may be gone , but--
but i still smell as sweet .
not what i was gonna say , but yeah .
what , hadn &apos;t you been itching for a new beginning ?
yeah , it cost me everything .
well , we kept you out of prison .
i suppose a pyrrhic victory
is still a victory .
speaking of bittersweet success ,
the mozart worked like a charm .
so hagen will get his retrial ,
and that sociopathic blackmailer will be back out on the street .
hey , you paid the piper .
that &apos;s the end , isn &apos;t it ?
i hope so , moz .
but i have a feeling it &apos;s just the beginning .
