no . we want to play
for boston police department &apos;s softball league .
heads up ! oop .

good job breaking it in .

goodbye , playoffs .
uh ... shoot .
the season &apos;s almost over ,
so , you know , may-- maybe next year .
bummer .
hold on . let me make sure i understand .
your science colleagues ,
who , for all you know ,
could be world @-@ class softball stars ,
aren &apos;t welcome at your softball practice ?
no . uh ... well ...
rizzoli .
dr. isles .
okay . i &apos;ll be right there .
we &apos;re not done here .
okay .
victim is enzo womack .
the running back from bcu ?
the dessertier from end zone cakes ?
did you just say &quot; dessertier &quot; ?
enzo womack is a well @-@ known cakemaker .
he just opened his first d.i.y. on charles street .
d.i.y. ?
&quot; decorate it yourself . &quot; it &apos;s on my bucket list .
what happened ?
stabbed twice in the neck .
he was probably here to support the bcu fundraiser .
any witnesses ?
happened in the car wash . nobody saw anything .
we got a hundred people in and out of here .
it &apos;s a huge intersection . we don &apos;t have one witness ?
once you drive in , it &apos;s just you , your vehicle ,
and automated equipment for six minutes .
maybe someone was hiding in the van .
do we know where he was coming from ?
his bakery , end zone cakes .
his nickname was &quot; end zone &quot;
&apos;cause he made so many touchdowns .
who removed his body from the van ?
dan mackenzie , team trainer .
he and the coach tried to revive him .
mackenzie and enzo were friends .
yeah , i think they played together .
yeah , mackenzie was a kicker .
played together for four seasons .
team &apos;s a mess .
so is the crime scene .
found his cellphone .
i got a bad feeling this isn &apos;t gonna be much help .
all right , let &apos;s get the van back to the evidence garage .
so much for a slow sunday .
what if i practiced my swing in that cagey thing ?
it &apos;s called a batting cage , maura .
i &apos;m looking for sergeant detective korsak .
what is he doing here ?
casey .
jane .
hi .
i didn &apos;t know you &apos;d be here today .
i work here .
hello , maura .
casey , how are you ?
i &apos;m okay .
uh , i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll just meet you downstairs .
okay . okay .
i &apos;m sorry . that wasn &apos;t much of a greeting .
let me start again . okay .
hello , jane .
hello . it &apos;s good to see you .
i said i &apos;d , uh , be in touch when i was ready .
so , i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re not ready .
it &apos;s complicated . i &apos;m getting closer , though .
okay . so -- so , why are you here ?
i need to talk to , uh , sergeant korsak .
elsie ! hey !
hello , girl . hi , casey .
hey , vince .
all right , well ,
you know , i don &apos;t want to get between you and korsak .
oh , i just stopped by to ask if he would watch elsie for me .
god , it &apos;s good to see you .
you can see me anytime you want .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
i promise -- i will .
well , you know where i am .
i &apos;m the kid that open the box
that said &quot; do not open until christmas . &quot;
no , i mean in november .
ma caught me crawling under her bed
looking for my birthday presents .
are you getting how major this is ?
maura , you &apos;re not even listening .
you have been talking about casey for 31 minutes .
i &apos;m having an epiphany here , a watershed moment .
i am having a life @-@ altering experience .
can you hand me the metal probe ?
yes .
i mean , casey gave me the perfect opportunity
to be my impatient self --
you know , to pressure him and demand answers ,
and -- and i didn &apos;t .
me . i was patient .
isn &apos;t that amazing ?
yes . can you hand me the forceps ?
okay , you cannot still be upset about the softball thing .
this &quot; softball thing . &quot; hmm .
i @-@ i put my pride on the line
and beg to be included in an extracurricular activity in front of my employees .
why is it so important to you ?
why is it so important to build interdepartmental bridges ?
you &apos;ve clearly never played in a softball league .
you just don &apos;t want us to play because you &apos;re too competitive
and you don &apos;t think we &apos;re any good .
i &apos;m right , aren &apos;t i ?
yes .
at least you &apos;re honest .
he still has remarkable musculature .
he must not eat his cakes .
yeah .
enzo was the first b.c.u player in years
who could have gone pro .
i &apos;m guessing that wasn &apos;t an option
once he tore his anterior cruciate ligament .
scar tissue looks to be about five years old .
b.c.u going for the money with a hand @-@ off to end zone .
man , he was fast .
oh , no !
womack is tackled hard .
he &apos;s not getting up .
folks , this does not look good .
it &apos;s amazing how fast your life can change .
all it took for casey was an i.e.d.
and some shrapnel . and a war .
my guess is casey dropped by to see you .
stop guessing . you &apos;re bad at it .
he came by to see korsak .
oh , stop timing me . i &apos;ll stop talking about casey .
there are hilt marks ...
there and there .
those are probably from the knife .
a small buck knife , maybe ?
well , many knives have hilts --
survival knives , hunting knives ,
skinning knives , commando knives , tanto knives .
can you please stop ?
some kind of particulate matter adhered to the wound .
well , that must have come off the knife .
and white fibers -- there .
i &apos;ll have the crime lab analyze all this .
okay , the victim &apos;s van is in the evidence garage .
i &apos;ll be back .
will you think about the , uh , &quot; softball thing &quot; ?
yes .
thank you .
sorry , the answer &apos;s still no .
we got a bunch of cake @-@ decorating stuff .
it &apos;s all covered with arterial blood spray and car @-@ wash suds .
killer was smart .
he ruined any chance we had of making a case with forensics .
doesn &apos;t it seem a little spur of the moment ,
stabbing someone in a car wash ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll get it all photographed and tested .
where &apos;s frost ?
well , the warrant came through .
he &apos;s working on enzo &apos;s laptop
and still trying to dry out his cellphone .
okay , i &apos;ll have the crime lab
comparison @-@ test all the tools and knives in here .
maura thinks that the murder weapon had a hilt .
this has a hilt .
i didn &apos;t know he was coming .
yeah , i figured .
he asked a lot of questions about you .
really ?
why did he leave elsie ?
i &apos;m taking care of her for a while .
he knew if he brought her by , i couldn &apos;t refuse her .
you &apos;re taking care of her ? for how long ?
maybe a few months .
why ? where &apos;s he going ? he didn &apos;t go into details .
you &apos;re a detective . didn &apos;t you ask ?
i didn &apos;t want to pry !
oh , that &apos;s so male .
you think this is frosting ?
maybe . crime lab can test it .
look , we got at least several years &apos; worth
of frosting and cake crumbs .
what the hell is &quot; fun @-@ dant &quot; ?
fondant .
and it &apos;s sticky , sweet , inedible crap
that they put on cakes .
don &apos;t put it on retirement cake .
duly noted .
you &apos;re a good girl , elsie .
oh , she &apos;s the best .
and you &apos;re a service dog .
casey needs you , so what are you doing here ?
hey , ma .
this is detective frost &apos;s mother , camille .
oh . nice to meet you . i &apos;m angela .
hi . pleasure .
you okay waiting here ?
yes , yes .
and thank you so much for taking us around .
sure . see ya , ma .
bye , babe .
what a nice man .
he drove me and my roommate and her son
all over boston while we were waiting for barry .
yeah , he &apos;s a good kid .
and , uh , your son and my daughter , jane , are like this .
i wish i lived closer .
i feel like i never see him .
you live in , uh , virginia , right ?
norfolk .
i teach at one of the military universities there .
nice . what do you teach ?
civil engineering .
well , now we know where , uh , detective frost gets his brains .
his father was actually pretty smart , too .
uh , we divorced 20 years ago .
i just got divorced .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m not .
well , anymore .
can i get you a cup of coffee ?
oh , no , thank you .
i think i already had enough on the way here .
i &apos;m actually trying to work up the nerve
to tell barry that i &apos;m getting remarried .
oh . congratulations .
why is that making you nervous ?
the divorce was hard on him .
and i never dated .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong .
barry is very respectful ,
but knowing him , you know , he has strong opinions .
well , we did bring them up
to have their own minds .
yes , we did .
it &apos;s crazy how the tables turn , isn &apos;t it ?
i was seeing this guy for a while ,
and , uh , my kids went nuts .
what &apos;d you do ?
felt guilty .
but then i decided i was allowed to be a person , too .
yes , you are .
excuse me .
i think you need to complain about your lunch order .
there &apos;s a phone in it .
rice is an effective desiccant .
are you using three @-@ syllable words
because your mother &apos;s in town ?
oh , man . i might be .
can you make it work ?
i &apos;m not sure . circuits are wet .
but i &apos;ve been having fun on enzo &apos;s laptop .
he liked three things .
let me guess -- women , cakes , and bcu football .
what a life -- football , women , and cake .
enzo was a season @-@ ticket holder .
and he also had every buc game
from the last 10 years on his hard drive .
that &apos;s a serious fan .
dude was hardcore .
he watched every game and a lot of replays .
pretty sure viewing football on his computer didn &apos;t kill him .
yeah , and i remember him to be quite the ladies &apos; man .
what about the women in his life ?
ho @-@ ho @-@ ho ! nice assortment of desserts .
i meant the cupcakes .
yeah , sure you did .
most of them are his old girlfriends .
he hired his old flames ?
which flavor would you choose , korsak ?
chocolate ? vanilla ?
so many cupcakes , so little time .
okay , i &apos;m about to file a harassment claim .
it has to be hostile and offensive .
keep talking .
enzo updated his schedule on this internal calendar .
well , he posted he was going to the car @-@ wash fundraiser .
who had access to that calendar ?
just his employees .
you mean just his ex @-@ girlfriends ?
check this out .
&quot; what i &apos;d like to do to my ex @-@ boyfriend . &quot;
where &apos;d you find that photo ?
she posted it on candidgram .
she posted selfies all day long .
okay , who &apos;s laura stephens ?
she looks like an employee . i &apos;ll check .
she &apos;s 24 .
she &apos;s a cake decorator at end zone cakes .
all right , well , come on .
maura &apos;s mad at me ,
so let &apos;s give her a cheap thrill ,
and she can comparison @-@ test the cake knives .
meet me at the elevator .
what &apos;s up ?
you know how i drove frost &apos;s mom
and her roommate around ?
yeah .
well , i think they &apos;re , uh ...
you know .
no , don &apos;t know .
i think they &apos;re a couple .
what ? !
does frost know ?
never mind . don &apos;t answer that .
it -- it &apos;s none of our business .
no way he knows .
she was married -- to his father .
well , what makes you think they &apos;re a couple ?
jane , they &apos;re a couple .
it &apos;s non of our business .
what &apos;s none of your business ?
we were ... just talking about ma .
it sounded like you were talking about her love life .
no . menopause .
we were talking about menopause .
yeah . yeah , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s none of our business if ma &apos;s in menopause .
see ya .
you ready ?
yes .
we should ... get maura and go .
boston homicide .
what are you doing about enzo ?
what &apos;s your name ?
valentina smith .
how could you let this happen ?
car washes are supposed to be safe !
uh , what was your relationship to him ?
we went to college together .
i &apos;m his office manager .
were you two involved ?
in college .
we haven &apos;t slept together in years .
and where were you this morning ?
delivering a wedding cake .
we &apos;ll need to verify that .
whatever .
i &apos;m not about to kill my boss .
we &apos;d like to talk to laura stephens .
everybody here was his friend .
we &apos;re working on a cake for his memorial service now .
they &apos;re making the boston cambridge university
football stadium .
oh , look ! it &apos;s a little enzo .
and this is a representation of heaven .
and i think that golden ladder
is so he can ascend . uh , dr. isles ?
the comparison test ?
oh , yes , of course .
damn , enzo liked them in all shapes , sizes , and colors .
is that harassment ?
possibly , yes .
you &apos;ll interfere with my process if you come any closer .
we &apos;d like to talk to you about enzo womack .
can you just wait a sec ?
crap , you made me bump the chin strap .
are these your knives ?
don &apos;t touch them .
i &apos;ll need a clay impression for a comparison test .
i didn &apos;t kill him , all right ?
a woman definitely killed that bastard , though .
how do you know a woman killed him ?
you think you can sleep with a girl ,
buy her brunch , whisper sweet bullshit in her ear ,
and then say , &quot; let &apos;s be friends , &apos; kay ? &quot;
you think you can do that over and over ?
we found this photo you posted , laura .
it was a joke .
it doesn &apos;t seem that funny to me .
me neither .
that looks pretty sharp .
it &apos;s a flower pin .
you should talk to everybody .
enzo strung us all along .
&quot; let &apos;s be friends , &apos; kay ? &quot;
no , not okay .
so , why &apos;d you work for him ?
do you know how hard it is
to find a decent job in this economy ?
i have a major in gender studies .
ooh . yeah , i know what you mean .
well , it seems to me that
enzo gave you a reason to kill him , laura .
he did , but i didn &apos;t .
i was at the gym . you can check .
they take a picture when they swipe it .
i want it back .
i have to work out later today .
it &apos;s a shame that laura has a solid alibi .
still , i think enzo was playing a dangerous game .
you think , uh , too many notches
on the bedpost got him killed ?
maybe .
okay , maura &apos;s finished testing all the knives .
our murder weapon is not that bakery .
so , it &apos;s nice that robin came with your mom ,
you know , so she could have some company .
my mom &apos;s really independent , but , yeah , i guess .
how do they know each other ?
they &apos;re both professors at the naval university in norfolk .
i didn &apos;t know your mom was a professor .
my mom was in one of the first classes
at the naval academy that allowed women .
are you kidding me ?
she &apos;s amazing .
she and my dad were midshipmen together .
that &apos;s how they met .
he had the career she should have .
and they &apos;re roommates , y @-@ your mom and robin ?
after robin &apos;s divorce , they decided to share expenses .
professors don &apos;t make that much .
well , it &apos;s good they have each other .
i mean to -- to share expenses .
no kidding .
come on . let &apos;s call it a day .
we got two games left in the season ,
and if we don &apos;t get in a practice today ,
the drug unit &apos;s gonna kick our ass .
since you put it that way ...
you think it &apos;s okay if -- if i bring my mom ?
oh , and -- and robin and cameron , too ?
sure .
yeah .
maura .
jane .
can &apos;t believe you weren &apos;t gonna tell us about practice .
okay ... look , there are only two more games left in the season ,
and -- and we &apos;ll be disqualified .
you &apos;re not part of homicide .
oh , so frost &apos;s mom is part of homicide ?
jane , we could buck up sides and have a scrimmage .
buck up ? who are you , opie ?
who &apos;s opie ?
shh . honey .
maura , you -- you don &apos;t have enough players for a team .
oh , we &apos;d be happy to play for maura &apos;s team .
yeah . why not ?
we &apos;re just a couple of old ladies looking for some exercise .
all right .
all right . so , you &apos;re gonna have to buck up , jane .
i &apos;d love to .
it &apos;s only fair that the winners buy the losers drinks .
korsak got to take cameron to icecream .
we got to endure this ?
lab results , dr . isles .
thank you .
all the identifiable organic substances
in the van were glucose @-@ based confectioner &apos;s compounds .
swell .
and blood and glycerin from the soap .
double swell .
there was one exception .
the blue substance that you found on the rear floor mat
is bulk of field paint .
field paint ?
bcu &apos;s colors are blue and ...
susie , can you check and see if
that field paint is from bcu ?
yeah , sure .
thank you .
oh , just two old ladies in need of some exercise .
mm . i think somebody lied .
it wasn &apos;t a lie . we are old ladies .
and we needed exercise .
it was such an exciting game .
6 @-@ 1 . we trounced you .
&quot; we &quot; ?
camille hit two home runs ,
and robin hit a grand slam .
so 2 for you , 4 for you , and zero for you .
exactly .
and is it a &quot; we &quot; when you got two ringers ?
oh , my god ! you knew .
well , i figured robin &apos;s swing had lost some power .
frost !
and mom -- you haven &apos;t played in a while .
we thought we were rustier than we were .
we scored one run -- one .
i think you played really well .
the drug unit &apos;s gonna destroy us .
well , not if you let us play .
and by &quot; us , &quot; you mean camille and robin ?
you &apos;re a very sore loser .
i did make it to the first base .
you don &apos;t say &quot; the . &quot;
what ?
you made it to first base because you were walked .
you know , walking &apos;s good .
to the walk .
to the walk .
walking .
why are you kicking my leg ?
i s @-@ should hand it to robin and camille .
jane , did you hurt your neck ? are you having a muscle spasm ?
really ?
i &apos;d like to propose a toast .
that &apos;s great sportsmanship .
see ? toasting the winning team .
uh , to two wonderful people
who have taught me the meaning of love and commitment --
my mom ... and her partner , robin .
barry , you knew ?
yeah , mom , i knew .
i had been agonizing over this for years .
you never brought it up . it wasn &apos;t my business .
honey .
i figured if you wanted to tell me , you would .
i told you .
you &apos;ve never given him enough credit .
i just wish i &apos;d known .
how many times have i invited you to massachusetts ?
i kept hoping you &apos;d make an honest woman out of her .
i &apos;m glad you finally have .
thank you .
congratulations .
yes , congratulations .
when is the wedding day ?
we actually haven &apos;t even set the date yet .
it &apos;s -- it was just time to tell you , barry .
i couldn &apos;t get married without you .
you &apos;ll be our best man ?
you know i will .
oh , and i have a great dress i haven &apos;t worn yet .
you haven &apos;t been invited .
listen , when we have our wedding ,
you &apos;ll all be welcome .
we &apos;d love to have you join us .
all right , well , this calls for champagne .
losing team is buying .
hear , hear !
as long as winning team stops mocking .
sorry , sorry !
what are you doing here ?
i wanted to apologize .
oh ? what did you do ?
come inside .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m so sorry . we -- we can talk out here .
i don &apos;t mean i can &apos;t make it up your stairs .
i mean i don &apos;t want to go inside .
where are you going ?
upstairs to hear your apology .
it might take me a while .
good . i have to put my glove away .
no . okay .
okay , okay , okay . okay , okay , okay .
um , coming !
coming .
coming . okay .
are you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m fine .
uh , come in . um , sit down .
can -- can i get you a beer or ...
maybe a water .
a water . okay .
thanks .
i remember the last time i was here .
right before your last tour in afghanistan .
my final tour .
it &apos;s like the last run on a ski slope .
you know as you &apos;re falling you shouldn &apos;t have taken it .
thank you for coming up . i @-@ i know you didn &apos;t want to .
i did . i ju--
i didn &apos;t want to be this close to you .
casey .
please .
i &apos;m sorry .
i asked sergeant korsak
to look after elsie because i &apos;m having surgery .
surgery ? w @-@ when ?
soon .
the stem @-@ cell trials ?
no . i &apos;m not a candidate .
i found a neurosurgeon .
he thinks he can remove the , uh , shrapnel
and bone shards from pressing against my spinal cord .
casey , that &apos;s incredible .
there are no guarantees ,
and , uh ... and there will be months of rehab .
but it &apos;s the first crack
of light i &apos;ve seen in a pretty dark tunnel .
well , let me -- let me help you .
i @-@ i want to go through this with you .
that &apos;s exactly why i didn &apos;t get in touch .
casey ... i @-@ it doesn &apos;t matter , okay ?
i care about you .
no .
this is no way to start a relationship ,
and this is where we are -- at the beginning .
okay , well , let &apos;s get to the middle .
i want to do this .
taking care of an invalid is an ugly form of intimacy .
there &apos;s no romance in it , jane .
this injury isn &apos;t you .
this is you .
i should have asked you not to go .
i should have asked you to wait .
did you see someone else while i was gone ?
yes .
did you care about him ?
yes .
then you &apos;ll find someone again .
what ? no .
casey , wait a minute . wait .
it &apos;s over with him . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s been over .
look , i realized that when i saw you again
how much i want this to work .
this won &apos;t work .
it will .
casey , please , just give me a chance . please .
do one thing for me .
anything .
let me kiss you ...
and then let me go .
casey , please , please .
goodbye , jane .
where do socks go ?
all you need is a half @-@ inch gap
for them to slip under the agitator paddle .
so not sock heaven .
check your drawers .
static electricity causes them to stick to other clothing .
i hope enzo gets to go to football heaven .
thank you for coming .
don &apos;t throw them away !
they don &apos;t have partners . they &apos;re making me sad .
okay . tell me what he said .
he is having surgery to remove bone and shrapnel .
what ? what &apos;s with the weird look ?
it &apos;s nothing .
hives , maura .
even white lies make you itch .
okay .
casey &apos;s condition is called cauda equina syndrome .
from what i &apos;ve observed in him ,
it probably involves t @-@ 11 and -12 and maybe l @-@ 1 .
same question -- why the weird look ?
surgery on a partially impaired paraplegic is very risky .
well , you &apos;re not a neurosurgeon .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m not .
so no guessing .
i just want to pretend like it &apos;s all gonna be fine .
can you do that with me ?
i can try .
salute , elsie . good girl !
good salute , elsie .
that wasn &apos;t a salute .
yes , it was .
looked like &quot; shake &quot; to me .
anybody want a bagel ?
yeah . thanks .
all right , so , where are we ?
we are nowhere .
we better get somewhere
or cavanaugh &apos;s gonna tear off some heads .
maybe i can help .
thanks to the team @-@ building softball game ,
the crime lab stayed up all night
to get these results to you .
i thought they were helping us solve murders because --
oh , i don &apos;t know -- it &apos;s their job .
the blue paint on the floor mat is consistent
with the paint used for the bcu field stencils .
that &apos;s right where the killer would have been .
frost , you said that enzo had season tickets .
was he at saturday &apos;s game ?
no . his ticket wasn &apos;t used ,
so i followed up with his office manager .
enzo had to work on a wedding cake .
it was the first game of the season ,
which means enzo didn &apos;t transfer that field paint
inside his van .
maybe our murderer did .
it didn &apos;t mean anything when i looked at it , but watch this .
enzo was watching this clip from saturday &apos;s game .
what kind of call is that ?
coach phillips ? what do we know about him ?
jane , what would be the motive ?
enzo hadn &apos;t played for him for five years .
phillips was a contender for a division i coaching gig .
it went away after bcu lost that season
five years ago .
am i disappointed ? yeah , yeah , i &apos;m disappointed .
coaching a division i team is a dream of mine .
but , uh , bcu --
we had a great run there
till enzo hurt himself .
sounds like phillips blames enzo .
well , that blue paint only tells us
that our killer was on that field .
frost , you get the phone working yet ?
no . got to put the battery back in .
okay , i want to see what else enzo was watching
the night before he was killed .
his laptop is in bric .
okay .
sergeant korsak ,
did casey tell you why he needed you to take elsie ?
no . he just said she might need a home for a few months .
he mentioned something i didn &apos;t want jane to hear .
what was that ?
he made me promise i would take care of elsie
if anything happened to him .
hey , you guys coming ?
yep .
okay . we got one shot at this .
if there &apos;s any moisture ,
the circuits will fry themselves .
turn it on .
do i have witnesses ?
sergeant detective korsak
is telling me to turn this phone on .
turn the damn phone on , frost .
i want it in writing
that this one is not on me if this phone ...
it &apos;s dead .
so much for your rice idea .
this is the whole list of video files enzo was watching .
can you play that one ?
bcu going for the money with a hand @-@ off to end zone .
wow ! look at womack as he breaks to the strong side and -- oh , no !
he &apos;s not getting up . folks , this does not look good .
ugh . why was enzo watching that ?
you see the right guard ?
yeah .
yeah .
i didn &apos;t . what are you talking about ?
let &apos;s see that again .
the normally sure @-@ footed right guard
looks like he slips on the turf .
and there goes hard @-@ charging der &apos;on martin
flying in at full speed .
enzo is down ! ouch !
frost , play that clip from saturday &apos;s game .
marcus to the right on a hand @-@ off .
oh ! how did that happen ?
looks like bcu &apos;s right guard lost his footing
and left running back jeff marcus
unprotected for that nasty hit .
ouch ! it reminds me of that hit
that ended enzo womack &apos;s career five years ago .
i think we just figured out what got enzo killed .
oh ! that was a nasty hit .
what ? what did -- what did you see ?
i &apos;d like to know what got enzo killed .
both bcu right guards , who played five years apart ,
faked the same trip on the same play .
to make sure their running back got tackled
and didn &apos;t score .
this is like the day i took that a.p. calculus exam .
you know , i couldn &apos;t have solved that inverse derivative problem
if my life depended on it .
calm down . calm down , okay ?
for once , i get to explain something to you .
frost , can you freeze both bad plays ?
that right guard and at least one other player --
probably the quarterback -- fixed that game in 2007 .
okay , and that right guard
fixed the same play five years later .
are you saying bcu players
from two separate seasons threw games ?
altered games .
it &apos;s too easy to get caught if you throw them .
if you just shave points ...
frost , can we see both quarterbacks ?
yeah , right there .
both quarterbacks made identical signals .
that says to me , &quot; we &apos;re throwing the play . &quot;
watch their eyes right before they tap their helmets .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
we have a shot caller -- who are they looking at ?
frost , do you have any other angles ?
so , enzo must have realized
the trip that ended his career wasn &apos;t accidental .
but why would the right guard fake a trip ?
enzo was his teammate .
the players who were cheating weren &apos;t trying to hurt him .
they were just trying to keep him from scoring .
to change the over / under .
that &apos;s what this is about .
of course .
what ? over / under what ?
over / under is a type of bet .
oddsmakers announce a number before a game .
it &apos;s their best guess of what the final combined score will be .
and i can bet over or under that number .
yes .
okay , i think i understand .
so if the teams &apos; scores , when added together ,
are lower than predicted , i win .
yes .
and if you know that there are dirty players
that are fixing the game to keep the score down ,
you bet on the under , and then you win big .
yeah , but why would a college player cheat ,
especially at a prestigious academic university ?
well , bcu is a division iii football program .
there &apos;s no money , no scholarships .
they &apos;re having a car @-@ wash fundraiser to buy equipment .
got another angle -- sideline camera .
coach phillips is the shot caller .
i don &apos;t think so . play it again .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
okay , play both the 2007 game and saturday &apos;s game .
watch mackenzie .
you see that ? he dropped the towel both times .
uh , the results are back on the substance found in enzo &apos;s wounds .
it &apos;s analgesic heat rub .
and the fibers i found were from cotton sports tape .
maura ...
you said the murder weapon had a hilt ?
could it be a multipurpose tool , like this one ?
yes .
is that enzo &apos;s phone ?
okay , you don &apos;t get credit for fixing it .
give it to me .
no .
i can look at cellphones , too .
give it to me and let me plug it in .
thank you .
here &apos;s his last text message .
to dan mackenzie , 7 : 54 a.m.
right before he went to the car wash .
&quot; need to talk . i hope i &apos;m crazy .
i think coach has bcu players shaving points . &quot;
he thought his coach was dirty .
&quot; i hope i &apos;m crazy . &quot;
we didn &apos;t want to accuse the program he loved
unless he was sure he was right .
so he went to the person he trusted the most --
his former teammate dan mackenzie .
it shouldn &apos;t be so swollen .
how many times i got to tell you to ice this sucker , huh ?
hey , you can &apos;t be in here . there &apos;s no women allowed .
bcu just made an exception .
well , what &apos;s this about ?
we checked your stats , dan .
you were a good field @-@ goal kicker .
but suddenly , you started missing .
was that when it started ?
when what started ?
you were missing kicks to shave points .
i don &apos;t know what you guys are talking about .
we &apos;re talking about basic greed .
living pretty large for a guy making $ 40,000
as a d @-@ iii athletic trainer .
i want a lawyer .
you came up with this scheme in college ,
but you knew enzo wouldn &apos;t cheat &apos; cause he was a good guy .
and he was going to the pros . you weren &apos;t .
he -- he -- he was accusing the team of cheating .
he was gonna give the bcu program a bad name .
enzo sent you a text before you killed him .
he thought coach phillips was corrupting the players .
it never occurred to him it was his friend .
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of enzo womack .
hey .
what are you doing here ?
i know you wanted me to pretend that everything will be fine .
what &apos;s that ?
some research i did on
decompressive lumbar spine surgery .
i don &apos;t wanna know .
jane , you need to know .
why ? i mean , he said goodbye , maura , so ...
jane , if you care about him ,
you &apos;ll look .
how bad is it ?
bad .
what am i gonna do ?
i wish i knew .
