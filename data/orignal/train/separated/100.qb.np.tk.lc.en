you &apos;ll be great .
oh , god , it &apos;s like i &apos;m a first @-@ time lawyer again .
how many cases have you argued ?
423 .
so ... this &apos;ll be your 424th .
my last .
it &apos;s my last one as a lawyer .
i just don &apos;t want to finish by embarrassing myself .
then don &apos;t .
you &apos;re always so good with the pep talks , aren &apos;t you ?
you want a tattoo .
i want a tattoo ? mm @-@ hmm .
&apos;cause it &apos;ll hurt so , so good .
you know what i feel ?
what ?
awake .
probably best when your eyes are open .
no , really awake .
like i haven &apos;t been in a while .
what are you doing tonight ?
what am i doing ?
i have no idea .
i want to see you again .
see me now .
no . i &apos;m serious . see me now .
mom . mom .
what ?
i have to go to school , and everyone &apos;s already here .
oh , my god .
i overslept .
i tried knocking . i ...
i was out .
i was really out .
i know .
you probably just needed to sleep .
but i have to go .
um , you be good today .
you &apos;re the mom today .
uh , brush your teeth
and do not lose any more clients .
i &apos;ll do my best .
where did you say you wanted this , alicia ?
oh , in front of the fireplace .
sorry , we had to start early .
the workers were here .
it &apos;s a go .
we have a lead on offices .
where ?
wallis &amp; frey .
the tax firm ?
yeah , they &apos;re breaking up .
the new lawyers are kicking out the old .
and they want us to lease their empty offices ?
really ? wallis &amp; frey ?
that &apos;s great .
not @-@ not that i don &apos;t love you all here .
oh . that &apos;s probably the broadband .
i &apos;ll get it .
how @-@ how much is the lease ?
we &apos;re trying to find out now .
good morning .
good morning . you &apos;re ...
marilyn , yes . the chair of your husband &apos;s
ethics commission .
i @-@ i know .
um , what can ... uh , why are you here , marilyn ?
i &apos;m sorry to throw myself at you like this , alicia ,
but i only discovered today that you &apos;re starting your own firm ,
and i wanted to catch you before ...
before i made too many mistakes ?
no , no , no . not at all .
it &apos;s just that the ethic rules for the governor
can be quite counterintuitive .
uh , you know , they &apos;ve changed a lot even
in the past few months ...
broadband ?
yeah , right this way .
um , marilyn , could we do this another time ?
heather ? hello .
alicia , oh , my gosh . what happened ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . did you go by work ?
someone else is in your office , a man who told me to get lost .
yeah , i @-@ i was going to ...
marilyn , can we do this another time ?
certainly .
pardon me .
do you want me to drop by this afternoon ?
yes .
n @-@ no . let me figure it out , okay ?
definitely . i &apos;ll drop by .
what was that ?
oh , nothing .
just someone from my husband &apos;s staff .
i wanted to tell you . i left lockhart / gardner .
and i &apos;m starting my own firm .
here ?
no . this is temporary .
we move into office space friday .
but shouldn &apos;t you be in court ?
yes .
it &apos;s just ... i &apos;ve mostly dealt with you , alicia ,
not diane .
so i &apos;m just ... a bit confused .
well , you are in good hands .
it &apos;s just ... i &apos;ve worked a lot on your case ,
and i &apos;m quite familiar with it .
your honor ...
i find the defense &apos;s motion to dismiss galling ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to &quot; gall &quot; you .
she is suggesting
there is no way ever to sue a gun manufacturer .
i &apos;m suggesting that congress passed
the lawful protection of commerce in arms act .
a reprehensible law .
i know that that &apos;s your opinion , your honor ,
but it is still the law .
and if i may , your honor ,
if you don &apos;t feel that you can judge fairly ...
i feel i can judge very fairly , thank you ,
no matter how destructive your client &apos;s product is to america .
your honor , it is true that the act
passed by congress outlaws suits against gun manufacturers ,
but there are exceptions .
this gun , a decatur .38 lobera ,
misfired and killed the husband of my client .
your honor , even if she can prove that it was defective ,
the gun was fired during the commission of a crime .
therefore , the manufacturer cannot be sued .
my client &apos;s husband was the victim of a crime .
he was held up and killed at his place of business by two robbers .
yes , but the gun was fired during a criminal act .
his gun . the victim &apos;s gun .
not the robber &apos;s .
yes , but it was fired ...
misfired .
when the robbers slapped it out of his hands .
therefore , he was not in possession of it .
thus , it was fired during a criminal act .
thank you .
i &apos;ll have to ask both attorneys to join me in chambers .
why ?
an administrative issue .
please , everybody .
take a seat .
let &apos;s just take a breath before we start in on this .
um , start in with ...
what ?
you , too , nancy . here .
everybody , take a big , long breath .
now , i &apos;ve received a request for a change of representation
from you , heather . is that true ?
yes . your honor , my firm recently
fired ten lawyers who were poaching clients .
we weren &apos;t poaching .
what else would you call it ?
you were negotiating with our top clients behind our back .
all right , everybody , please , please , please .
unclench your fists . okay ?
look at ... look at your fist .
squash it . come on .
squash it . i work with kids in gangs .
that &apos;s what we say .
squash it .
there you go .
diane ,
you have something to say ?
yes . i am personally offended , your honor .
i &apos;ve been developing this case for two years .
no , you haven &apos;t , diane . we have .
cary and myself ... - i took on this case .
i brought it to this point ...
your honor , these are the bills
segregating out hours based on partner and associate work ...
where did you get those ?
billing is not an effective way to determine work .
it &apos;s not an effective way ?
what other way would you ...
okay , okay , okay . everybody , please .
please , please . okay ? we were doing so well .
come on . squash it .
everybody , come on .
let &apos;s see it .
come on .
there we go .
heather , it is unorthodox to switch representation
on the first day of motions ,
especially with diane already commencing .
so i &apos;m going to ask you .
diane ?
or alicia and cary ?
what is it ?
heather , i have made it
my life to fight for gun control .
this is the wedge issue to drive into the plcaa .
alicia and cary .
your honor , we have an immediate request for your assistance .
the client &apos;s files , all two years of files ,
we need to have them transferred to our law firm .
what law firm ? you &apos;re working out of your apartment .
well , we &apos;re in the process of finding new office ...
your honor , we need the case files .
they don &apos;t belong to lockhart / gardner .
they belong to our client .
agreed . diane , have them sent to
florrick @-@ agos &amp; associates .
when can we expect delivery ?
how &apos;d it go ?
they took it .
my case .
what ? who ?
who do you think ?
where are you going ?
to get it back .
oop , sorry .
i hope you don &apos;t mind . we had problems with the kids &apos; toilet .
how was court ?
we got it .
how much do wallis &amp; frey want for their lease ?
uh , it wasn &apos;t what we expected . they want us to join them .
join their firm ?
yes , we &apos;d split the office space , the lease , the clients .
do we want that ?
no .
they &apos;re tax attorneys .
with office space .
yeah , but we just got out from under lockhart / gardner .
do we really want to throw ourselves
back into another corporate situation ?
i don &apos;t think so .
marilyn ? mm @-@ hmm ?
hello .
oh , hi .
uh , i hope you don &apos;t mind .
i just needed a glass of water .
no , i thought you were calling this afternoon .
and i thought i was just dropping by .
i hope this doesn &apos;t inconvenience ...
what do you need ?
i just need to take your firm
through a short powerpoint on the ethical rules of a start @-@ up .
uh , i &apos;ve heard the rules .
i &apos;ll tell them the rules . we don &apos;t have time .
i &apos;m sorry to be rude . may i use your restroom ?
yes . are you all right ?
can you show me ?
right this way .
ms. garbanza ?
hello ? are you all right ?
i &apos;m sorry .
no .
not at all . can i ... can i get you something ?
maybe a hand towel ,
if you don &apos;t mind .
yes , of course .
here .
is it , uh , food poisoning ?
it &apos;s morning sickness .
really ?
congratulations .
have you read what to expect when you &apos;re expecting ?
yes .
it &apos;s awful , isn &apos;t it ?
well , yeah , they don &apos;t sugarcoat it .
did you read the chapter on pregnancy complications ?
oh , you shouldn &apos;t read that .
everybody gave me a copy .
i have eight books .
i couldn &apos;t not read it .
i &apos;m sorry i came by . i know you &apos;re very busy .
that &apos;s okay . it &apos;s your job .
yes , it is .
what a silly job , making sure other people follow the rules .
how long will it take
to see your powerpoint ?
20 minutes .
alicia .
we need to get to court .
yeah . one minute .
why don &apos;t you come by tomorrow at 3 : 00 ? we &apos;ll do it then .
okay .
okay ?
do you want me to call ... - oh , no .
it &apos;s okay . i just want to sit here for a minute .
i &apos;ll get you a glass of water .
alicia .
yeah .
you &apos;re very nice .
i &apos;ll be right back .
uh , mom , some boxes .
oh , good , cary . the files arrived .
you &apos;re kidding .
i underestimated them .
what ?
or overestimated them . uh @-@ oh .
&quot; to florrick &amp; agos , we are doing our best to ...
&quot; process your request . and in the meantime ,
&quot; please accept the contents of your desks
&quot; as a goodwill gesture .
will gardner , managing partner . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe they &apos;d endanger their own clients
to get back at us .
it &apos;s not their client anymore .
they don &apos;t give a damn .
come on .
where , to court ?
no , he &apos;ll be expecting that .
the plan is simple .
we are in a superior position to branch out
from chicago to new york and then l.a.
but we need to act now .
i have clients wondering about our losses ...
david , when i &apos;m finished , you can talk .
the first move is to destabilize our competitors .
these are the top 12 litigators at competing firms .
i want you to select one name
and target him or her for acquisition .
do you understand ?
david , you can talk now .
i &apos;ll be right back .
mr. gardner ?
this came for you .
you got a subpoena from them ?
what ?
they want their files .
and they &apos;re taking us to court for them ?
no . the acdb .
what the hell is that ?
the attorney disciplinary board .
oh . that &apos;s the board that ... ?
suspended me . alicia does have a sense of humor ,
i &apos;ll give her that .
don &apos;t let her get into your head .
no .
that &apos;s where i want her .
thank you , your honor .
i know that the plaintiff &apos;s team is
somewhat in flux , so if they would like me
to summarize my motion again ...
no , nancy ,
we read the court transcripts ,
and we ask your honor to deny
her motion to dismiss .
you are rejecting the protection of arms act ... ?
no , your honor ,
it is the law of the land .
your honor , i know that your sympathies
tend against my client .
nancy , stop playing me .
sorry , i &apos;m not . i &apos;m speaking from my heart .
i , myself , have never fired a gun in my life ,
but what matters to me is justice .
good for you .
the difficulty i &apos;m having ,
alicia , and , um ...
cary agos .
cary . is that nancy is right on the law .
if the gun is fired during the commission of a crime ...
yes , your honor , but we don &apos;t know
if it did go off during the commission of a crime .
they were holding up a car wash , so ...
they were accused of holding up a car wash .
one is dead , and the other is currently on trial
in the cook county criminal court ,
and no determination has been made on his guilt or innocence .
nancy ? any thoughts ?
your honor , he &apos;s being prosecuted .
yes , and if he is found &quot; not guilty , &quot;
then it is up to his honor
to decide whether there was indeed a crime .
that is exactly right .
we will wait for the determination from the criminal court .
in the meantime , we will address
the question of the product &apos;s defect .
nancy ?
nancy ? !
do your friends in the front row agree or disagree ?
what ? um , your honor ,
if that is your ruling ,
we have no choice but to acquiesce .
i &apos;ll take criminal court .
i know how the sa will prosecute this .
great , and i &apos;ll go to disciplinary board
and get our files .
will will be there . are you okay with that ?
i &apos;m great with that .
your honor , this is a signed confession by lee st. george ,
the accomplice to this man .
objection . mr. st. george hanged himself
while in cook county jail ,
so we have no way to corroborate this .
your honor , it doesn &apos;t matter .
he confessed to robbing the car wash .
olivia , you got a second ?
i got a 19 @-@ year @-@ old kid who was duped into a robbery ,
and is facing 20 years .
what do you think ?
i think i can help you .
really ? why ?
i think your guy &apos;s innocent .
oh , come on .
olivia , i know we &apos;ve butted heads in the past ,
but let me help you .
geneva pine likes to sit on her brady material .
you think she &apos;s withholding exculpatory evidence ?
i think that she sometimes likes to build momentum in her case ,
and then , let the evidence magically appear .
hello , everyone .
welcome to the attorney compliance and disciplinary board
where we handle disputes between lawyers in a collegial manner .
and welcome back , will .
uh , i hope this visit to our sanctum
will prove more fruitful .
can we ask mrs. florrick why she chose this venue
for her complaint and not a court subpoena ?
we can .
mrs. florrick ?
mr. gardner has already shown
his true stripes to this board .
and we thought you would be best
to discern a pattern of abuse here .
oh , go to hell . she &apos;s using will &apos;s disbarment ...
excuse me , sir . i haven &apos;t called on you yet .
mrs. florrick has already admitted she &apos;s hoping
this board will be biased against my firm .
not your firm .
you .
we would only ask that this complaint be quashed
until the court &apos;s jurisdiction is satisfied .
we are in active litigation at this moment ,
mr. chairman ...
after poaching my case .
no .
we did not approach the client .
she approached us ,
disappointed with your representation .
mr. chairman , we need all these case files
so that we can properly represent the client &apos;s interests ,
and mr. gardner and ms. lockhart
are actively delaying ...
what , i don &apos;t rate ?
and mr. lee are actively delaying
the delivery of these files
in an attempt to win the client back .
is this true , will ?
no . we are carefully culling
our records for these files .
there &apos;s no need to cull .
this isn &apos;t the &apos; 70s .
lockhart / gardner &apos;s it department
keeps a careful , ongoing record of all its cases .
all you have to do is type in this code and push &quot; return &quot; &quot;
how do you know that ?
i worked there .
will ...
you were suspended because of this kind of nonsense .
get her the files , or be sanctioned .
diane ?
oh , we &apos;re handling it , lionel . don &apos;t worry .
oh , no , no . i just wanted to say ,
i told florrick &apos;s people that
you would make a far better justice than blair koturbash .
i &apos;m sorry ?
the governor &apos;s people called to vet koturbash ,
and i said they were crazy not to nominate you
for the supreme court seat .
but i &apos;m sure everything will be fine .
well , how long until the meeting is over ?
well , please tell mr. gold to call .
kalinda ?
i need help .
peter florrick is vetting another candidate
for the supreme court .
it may just be for show .
peter may want it to look like a fair process .
or it ... it could be because of events here .
i &apos;ll find out .
good , thanks .
bill me personally .
bad day ?
found your defect for your gun case .
you want me to come back ?
no , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s just not my case anymore .
it &apos;s too bad . it &apos;s winnable .
hello ?
hello , alicia . it &apos;s gina ... at work .
i mean , your old work .
oh . hi , gina . how are you ?
good .
uh , actually , not so good .
they &apos;ve stopped paying for teleconferencing from home ,
and i have child @-@ care problems .
i &apos;m so sorry . i would have called ,
but , uh , we &apos;re not hiring assistants right now .
we &apos;re still looking for office space .
what if i gave you something
that would help win your gun case ?
what if ? what is it ?
no . i need my same salary ,
two days at home , one year guaranteed .
uh , carey ,
do you have a minute ?
everything all right ?
yeah .
um , just , what did grace want ?
oh , she just wanted to know if i was converted in campus faith ,
or if i always was a christian .
okay , here &apos;s the thing .
i don &apos;t want my family life overlapping with my work life ,
so , if you don &apos;t mind ,
the next time grace wants to talk to you ,
just tell her you &apos;re busy ?
it &apos;s completely innocent ,
alicia .
i know .
i just don &apos;t want my daughter distracted .
i want her to do her homework .
okay . sorry .
no , no .
everything &apos;s fine .
um , i have to go and get us a ballistics expert .
i &apos;ll be back in an hour .
grace ?
bye .
see ya .
i wasn &apos;t doing anything .
i know , i just wanted the pleasure of your company .
alicia &apos;s going to want us to join wallis &amp; frey .
i know .
they want a portion of our chumhum fee .
we need to outvote alicia .
or find new office space .
this is all about us invading her home .
find something , and we won &apos;t need to outvote her .
hello ?
hi
um , i have a meeting with alicia at 3 : 00,
but i think she &apos;s a little late .
actually , she had a meeting to go to .
i &apos;m her partner , cary agos .
may i help you ?
i &apos;m the chair of the governor &apos;s ethics commission .
um , i just had a few questions .
sure .
and you &apos;re making soup ?
no . i just never know when i might feel sick .
so you &apos;ve acquired chumhum as a client ?
that &apos;s a great account .
oh , it is .
it &apos;s just their midwestern business ,
but it &apos;s pretty big .
but it didn &apos;t look like
the account was always gonna go your way ?
well , we @-@ we had a battle with lockhart / gardner ,
our old firm , over it .
and peter florrick
heard about your troubles with the account ?
well , he was here , so , yeah , i guess he did .
he was here , at the apartment ,
when you heard about losing chumhum ?
yes . why ?
no reason . so you were surprised
when governor florrick made a speech about internet taxation ?
i mean , that @-@ that speech really turned the tides for you .
you work for mr. florrick ?
governor florrick ? yes .
i mean , after that speech ,
the account really came your way ...
actually , why don &apos;t we wait for alicia to return ?
maybe she should help answer these questions .
excuse me .
just so i understand , mrs. florrick .
you took the case from diane lockhart ?
no . the client came to me of her own free will .
i didn &apos;t take her .
i was hired by lockhart / gardner .
i know .
and we would like to hire you , too .
we &apos;ll pay your usual fee ,
and ask nothing more than your good judgment .
ah , my good judgment .
mr. mcveigh , i know you &apos;re married to diane
and i don &apos;t want to cause any problems for you ,
but there is a defective gun out there ,
and i know that means more to you than anything .
you know what means more to me than anything ?
not being used .
i &apos;m not using you .
all i am asking you to do is ...
tell the truth in a case .
you &apos;re not after the truth .
forget our issues with lockhart / gardner .
mrs. sorrentino is an innocent woman
who deserves justice ; that &apos;s the truth .
what do you need me to do ?
anything . start from scratch . dig deeper .
there has to be something you missed .
i don &apos;t miss things , mrs. florrick .
he had a lot of guns .
he &apos;s a ballistics expert .
they were ... really elaborate .
it &apos;s all right for him to have them , but ...
guns are dangerous .
i want to fire one sometime .
no . i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
have you ever fired one ?
no .
i want to sometime .
they sent the files ...
i can &apos;t believe it .
don &apos;t .
they redacted them .
you &apos;re kidding .
nope . they &apos;re toying with you .
i want a baby .
you ...
what ?
don &apos;t worry , i don &apos;t want you .
i just want your baby .
you don &apos;t have to be the dad .
i don &apos;t want you to stick around .
isabel , i &apos;ve known you three days .
right .
this isn &apos;t about commitment
or wanting to live with you .
i want you to get me pregnant
and ... go away .
i got to go to work .
so , that &apos;s a no ?
it &apos;s a &quot; i don &apos;t know what the hell you &apos;re talking about ,
but i want to return to people who make sense &quot;
you really think i wanted a baby ?
i did .
oh ... psyche .
come on , get me pregnant , will .
bye , crazy lady .
but i need your baby inside me , will .
i &apos;ve been asked to testify in the sorrentino gun case .
you &apos;ve been asked ?
by whom ?
alicia florrick .
and you &apos;re ... asking me if this is all right ?
no . we said when we got married
that we wouldn &apos;t have veto power over each other &apos;s cases .
so you &apos;re just informing me ?
yes .
this was my case .
i know .
and it &apos;s winnable .
winnable for alicia .
no , winnable for heather sorrentino .
that &apos;s not fair .
how is that not fair ?
well , you &apos;ve already made up your mind ,
so go , go do it .
the gun is defective ...
it should be taken off the street .
yep .
go . be a hero .
they &apos;re called junk guns--
that &apos;s the term that law enforcement uses
for cheaply made handguns .
you see a lot of them , because they &apos;re easy to buy .
did you examine the lobera .38
that killed tim sorrentino ?
yes .
i compared it to five separate loberas that i bought
from five different stores .
why ?
to ensure that my test sample was random .
and what did you find ?
the trigger mechanism had a faulty spring ,
and the resistance was 75 % less than normal .
so with this kind of hair trigger ,
could a gun discharge if it hit the ground ?
i &apos;d be surprised if it didn &apos;t .
thank you , mr. mcveigh .
i don &apos;t know much about guns ,
but , um , my daddy does hunt a little bit ,
and he told me that there are other factors
that can contribute to a firearm &apos;s performance .
um , such as weather , right ?
certainly .
were you aware that on june 18,
the day mr. sorrentino died ,
that chicago was experiencing a heat wave
and the temperature was 98 degrees ?
no .
how about moisture ...
like ... from a car wash ,
could that affect a firearm &apos;s performance ?
it could .
so if i kept a gun locked in a drawer
in a damp environment in 98 @-@ degree heat ,
could that cause a hair trigger ?
it could .
you , uh , asked me to look into the vetting process
of the governor @-@ elect .
it &apos;s real ?
yeah .
they &apos;re , um , they &apos;re vetting blair koturbash ,
thomas veracruz and janet sasaki .
i &apos;m out ?
i ... i can &apos;t say that .
thank you .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s what i thought .
and here we are again .
but , uh , no mrs. florrick ?
she &apos;s in court , your honor , but i &apos;m cary agos ,
and i &apos;m here to argue ... - lionel is fine .
and what seems to be the problem now ?
this is what mr. gardner and ms. lockhart have sent us .
uh , will ...
will ...
we sent every file we &apos;re legally required to ...
you &apos;re trying to bleed us out of this case .
that is not true .
florrick and associates ... - florrick @-@ agos .
is legally entitled to client files .
they are not legally entitled to work product .
and the redactions are your work product ?
yes . our personal notes , our observations ,
our @-@ our legal stratagems .
not your legal stratagems ,
our legal stratagems from when
we worked for you .
yes , when you were
a lockhart / gardner employee ... in other words ,
our work product .
your honor ,
we &apos;d like to call a hostile witness
to prove that this isn &apos;t true .
i mean , mr. chairman .
miss sharma ,
you conducted investigative work on heather sorrentino &apos;s suit
against decatur firearms ?
yes .
what questions did you ask them ?
i was trying to determine if anyone had prior knowledge
of the flaws in the lobera .38 .
and what did you conclude ?
objection .
he &apos;s fishing for content for his lawsuit .
keep it on point , mr. agos .
did you take notes during these interviews ?
i did .
what did you do with these notes ?
i shared them with ms. lockhart ,
and then i put them away in the files .
lionel , clearly these notes are part of the client files ,
but they have been redacted .
just a few questions .
kalinda , did you write anything else
in your notes besides the employees &apos; answers ?
i did . comments and observations .
such as ?
i wanted to look into one of the lab employees .
i suspected was an alcoholic .
so you didn &apos;t just record objective facts--
you memorialized subjective opinion ,
follow @-@ ups , strategies .
yes .
uh , hello ? hello ?
may i help you ?
hi .
uh , robyn burdine , the florrick @-@ agos investigator .
i just have a quick follow @-@ up .
miss sharma , what is this ?
it &apos;s , um , it &apos;s an invoice to heather sorrentino for my services .
your investigative services in connection with the decatur firearms case .
yes .
but this is not a lockhart / gardner invoice .
this has been issued by you personally .
is that because you are an independent contractor
engaged by lockhart / gardner ,
and technically not an employee of the firm ?
yes .
mr. chairman , this invoice proves that kalinda sharma
was engaged directly by the client ,
and therefore her notes are our client property .
at least i don &apos;t see any rats .
i think we got the real files .
no redactions .
here , either .
good job , you two .
mom , there &apos;s someone at the door .
oh , mr. mcveigh , hello .
you got a minute ?
yes . um , what can i help you with ?
my examination of the .38 .
oh , that &apos;s okay . we have other evidence .
when i first examined the firing mechanism ,
it was easy to access ,
there was no need to take it apart .
but i was thinking about the environmental conditions
mentioned in court , so ...
this time i wanted to be sure .
sure of what ?
these are ... ?
what you need to win .
that &apos;s interesting ,
because when i hear someone yell , &quot; just give him the money , &quot;
i assume they &apos;re conducting a robbery .
objection . argumentative .
mr. rolfe already explained that he was just trying
to get the victim out of there alive .
withdrawn .
your honor ... i would like to add one more witness .
the gun had bad pins .
in what way ?
in what way were they bad ?
this is a standard cocking cam pivot pin .
it &apos;s kind of a link between the trigger and the hammer .
this is the pin that was in tim sorrentino &apos;s gun .
it was defective . that &apos;s what caused the hair trigger .
in your opinion ...
and in your opinion , what caused this defect ?
the gun was new , so ... owner misuse wasn &apos;t the problem .
that leaves a flaw in manufacturing .
so ... it was already damaged
before it was installed into tim sorrentino &apos;s gun ,
and a gun like this could discharge if it hit the ground ?
yes , definitely .
so ... a murder charge against my client
would clearly be unwarranted .
objection . your honor ,
beyond the scope , beyond the sense .
i &apos;ll withdraw ... and rest my case .
thank you .
all in a day &apos;s work .
nice job you did there , cary , getting them that witness .
having an innocent man always helps .
we &apos;ll reduce to involuntary manslaughter .
that &apos;s the best i can do .
this isn &apos;t about having a plea bargain , geneva .
this is about clearing mr. rolfe of all charges .
five years . with good time credit ,
you &apos;ll be out in three . you have ten minutes to decide .
all right , it &apos;s not what we &apos;d hoped for ,
but we can still beat this in court .
take it .
what ? !
wait . the asa is just playing a game of chicken .
and she won . take it , adam .
you don &apos;t take five years , you &apos;re likely facing 20 .
take it .
he took the deal ?
he didn &apos;t want to risk 20 years .
well , we have to find a new strategy , because his guilty plea
just gave nancy crozier her criminal act .
mom ? i &apos;m going back to my room to study . see ?
good . thanks .
i &apos;m sorry i missed you before .
yes , but it seems
you got your answers from cary instead .
yes , he mentioned that peter was here
when you discovered the chumhum account was in trouble .
peter did not know that .
but he was here ?
yes . having sex with me .
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t mean to ...
pry ?
yes .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m wondering , ms. garbanza .
who are you really working for ?
the governor ... of course .
so , that &apos;s why you hid the fact
that you were really here to snoop around
about peter &apos;s internet taxation speech ?
i , uh ...
i had a tip .
someone called my office anonymously ,
saying that peter used his bully pulpit
to help you sign chumhum .
i wanted to investigate in order to protect peter .
you mean governor florrick ?
yes , of course . governor florrick .
and how does this investigation protect him ?
when i write a report
clearing you and governor florrick of wrongdoing ,
it will inoculate you against future investigation .
you &apos;re right not to trust me , alicia .
my job is both friendly and antagonistic .
but i &apos;d like to tell you where your story is weak .
go for it .
you should warn cary about talking to outsiders .
you should ask the governor
not to intervene in your business again .
he doesn &apos;t .
he does .
when it comes to his family , he does .
and that &apos;s what will eventually ...
... hurt him .
okay .
i need to go .
can i get you anything ?
the second trimester .
well , we could put the plant manager on the stand .
he must have known about the defective pins .
he &apos;ll just deny it .
then we need to try another plcaa exception .
fine . which one ?
breach of warranty ?
it &apos;s a stretch . a big one .
mcveigh gave us the defect .
we need to demonstrate how it violated the warranty .
and no one &apos;s ever tried this before ?
no one &apos;s ever had judge davies .
look , he wants to rule for us .
we need to give him something .
okay , warranty violation . only problem ?
lockhart / gardner has the manufacturer &apos;s warranty documents .
of course they do .
you &apos;re wearing me out .
what if i did want a kid ?
what if you what ? are we joking now or what ?
we &apos;re joking ... and not joking .
i got to go .
oh , we were about to start without you .
i &apos;m here .
rock and roll .
florrick &amp; agos is in the unfortunate position of coming to you
hat in hand asking for relevant documents piecemeal .
as of today , that ends .
mr. chairman , we ask for sanctions .
and the chair agrees .
every day that files are kept from florrick &amp; agos ,
a fine of $ 20,000 will be applied .
that ...
that won &apos;t be necessary .
we &apos;ll turn over everything immediately .
once we &apos;re properly compensated for our time and effort .
your what ?
well , here &apos;s a copy of our standard retainer agreement .
mrs. sorrentino hired us on a contingency basis .
and that means we &apos;d only get paid if she won .
since we &apos;re no longer the attorneys of record ,
we &apos;re entitled to compensation for our work product to date .
at standard rates , that comes to ... $ 145,000 .
we &apos;re on a contingency basis ,
and our client doesn &apos;t have that kind of money .
well , once someone cuts us a check for the 145 gs ,
you &apos;ll get your files .
objection !
your honor has already ruled .
the accused , mr. rolfe , was sentenced yesterday
to involuntary manslaughter .
a crime .
thus , the plaintiff cannot sue ,
as the gun was fired during a criminal act .
which is why we would like to amend our suit
from product liability to breach of warranty .
i &apos;m sorry . mrs. florrick is just obviously
playing a game of musical plcaa exceptions .
your honor , we have enough evidence to demonstrate ...
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m gonna have to stop you right there , mrs. florrick .
you &apos;ve been replaced as plaintiff &apos;s counsel .
i &apos;ve been ...
heather ?
they have all the files , alicia .
i just want to win , that &apos;s all .
i &apos;m sorry .
permission to be seated , your honor ?
permission granted .
well , here we are , exactly where we were two days ago .
congratulations .
mrs. florrick ?
don &apos;t want you to forget this .
have a nice day .
your honor , i would like to amend the suit
from product liability to breach of warranty .
lockhart &amp; gardner .
oh , yeah , she is . one second .
peter florrick for you .
okay .
hello ?
hello , governor .
yes , i understand .
i , uh , appreciate the honor of even being considered .
yes , that would be great .
i &apos;ll have my assistant call .
yes , all the best to you , too , peter .
so , you &apos;re going running now ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve got this energy .
i don &apos;t know where it &apos;s coming from , but i &apos;m going to ride it .
what &apos;s up ?
nothing . so , we got heather back .
we did , didn &apos;t we ?
it was like old times .
i was angry , you were calm .
what would you say if i stayed ?
peter screwed you over ?
yes .
it &apos;s an odd psychology , isn &apos;t it ?
he can hurt his wife all he wants .
but if anyone else tries to do it , he goes absolutely tribal .
bill and hillary on steroids .
i &apos;m taking this firm to the top , diane .
we &apos;re gonna rip through our opponents .
no votes .
just decide and go .
and it won &apos;t be polite anymore .
anyone in our way , we kick their ass ,
fire them or buy them out .
can you handle that ?
i &apos;m through being polite .
good .
then welcome aboard .
i don &apos;t think we should get in business with these people .
we just got out from under all of this .
it &apos;s ridiculous . why are we even ... ?
okay . ok ...
okay .
we need to decide . we look like idiots to them .
screw them . they &apos;re tax attorneys .
they &apos;re tax attorneys who are offering us office space .
okay , i &apos;m gonna speak for myself .
i was impressed with their offer .
wallis &amp; frey will not touch
the first three years of chumhum money . that is all ours .
that &apos;s a good deal .
yes , but we &apos;ll share voting rights .
our ten partners with their ten partners .
do we really want that ?
we want to do something .
look , we need to get out of here .
this isn &apos;t just about me .
zach , get your sister out of the kitchen ... now .
look , alicia , if this is just about your apartment ...
no !
we are not a real firm until we have real offices .
we ... we can &apos;t meet with clients here .
we can &apos;t meet with neil gross here .
and lockhart &amp; gardner &apos;s gaining initiative while
we &apos;re sitting around squabbling .
yeah , but we shouldn &apos;t commit to wallis &amp; frey
for their office space .
or we &apos;ll end up top @-@ heavy like lockhart &amp; gardner ,
which is exactly why we left them .
okay , you know what ?
we can debate this till we &apos;re blue in the face .
we &apos;re all partners here . let &apos;s just take a vote .
no , no . we have to look at how the financials line up .
alicia &apos;s a name partner . she &apos;s calling for a vote .
so we vote . okay ?
all those in favor for joining wallis &amp; frey , raise your hands .
what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;ve been bought out .
just now ? by who ?
i &apos;m so glad you came on board .
we need tax attorneys , and we have the infrastructure .
yeah , florrick &amp; agos is a joke .
they &apos;ll be out of business in a month .
right . thanks .
