there &apos;s a safe . here &apos;s the location and the key code .
no !
drop it !
if malcolm finds out that you killed his daughter --
that was me .
doesn &apos;t matter . he &apos;ll bury us all .
we &apos;re gonna have to make sure he doesn &apos;t find out .
daniel attacked you . you shot him .
only when i knew he intended to kill me .
she had to shoot him ? self @-@ defense ?
what happened has been hard for all of us to accept .
but i don &apos;t accept it .
if all this hadn &apos;t happened ,
we &apos;d be having her funeral right now .
you were gonna kill victoria ?
my brother values our secrets .
he &apos;ll do anything to keep &apos; em buried .
i found the envelope
you were looking for .
would you destroy it , please ?
i &apos;m trying to track down agent kate taylor .
was she working with anyone on your team ?
jack porter . what &apos;d you say your name was ?
malcolm black .
he gonna make it ?
what happens if he doesn &apos;t ?
then i &apos;ll have two bodies to deal with .
boss wants him alive .
this guy &apos;s the mastermind behind flight 197 .
moved all that money around for the terrorists
like david friggin &apos; copperfield .
no , i didn &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t .
boss heard conrad grayson was gonna kill him ,
so he figured ,
one man &apos;s trash ...
who ...
who do you work for ?
same as you now .
you didn &apos;t come to bed last night .
they i.d.ed the body . it &apos;s him .
so it &apos;s taken care of then .
i know that i owe everything to your sacrifice ,
the lie that we told in daniel &apos;s name .
the irony is i still lost you .
that &apos;s why you slept on the couch , right ?
it &apos;s that ...
i find it hard to lie next to you after what you confessed .
if you hadn &apos;t betrayed me ...
the choices i made 20 years ago ...
you know i was desperate to save my son .
now he &apos;s gone anyway . so ...
i can &apos;t expect your forgiveness .
how can i when i can &apos;t forgive myself ?
they &apos;re bringing over the rest of daniel &apos;s things .
i would appreciate a couple of hours to go through them .
of course .
then how about we , uh , talk tonight ,
away from here ?
the lighthouse in montauk .
our old rendezvous .
of course .
thank you very much . appreciate it .
you &apos;re welcome .
well , look what the tide brought in .
more like the commuter flight from d.c.
and you must be nolan ross .
lyman ellis .
it is an honor
to have a future congressman grace my club .
one of my most staunch supporters summers up here ,
so i couldn &apos;t leave town without seeing my baby sis .
i assume you came to scold me .
now why would you think a thought like that ?
fox and cnn picked up that muckraking piece on daddy &apos;s death ,
and you show up not a week later ?
yeah , well , i was surprised
you were the one dredging up that whole ordeal .
made me worry something was wrong ,
and maybe it &apos;s time we got you back home to savannah .
well , you know , actually , that ...
article was my fault .
i gossiped to the wrong person .
and while i can &apos;t unring that bell ,
how about you join us for dinner tonight ?
you can fill me in on your run for office
and maybe accept a handsome campaign donation .
well , that &apos;s , uh ...
i &apos;m , uh ...
i apologize for charging in on you like this , lou .
you know how overprotective i can be .
but i &apos;d be a fool not to accept
your friend &apos;s apology and contribution .
every penny counts .
that it does .
thank you for coming .
i would &apos;ve come down , but ...
victoria &apos;s still there ?
yes , she is . what &apos;s wrong ?
exactly that .
after what you told me , how ...
i interrupted your plan for her ...
i &apos;m meeting her tonight , at the lighthouse in montauk .
they &apos;ll rule it a suicide .
grieving mother jumps to her death .
i &apos;m not inhuman .
seeing her mourn daniel gave me pause ,
but that doesn &apos;t erase what she &apos;s done .
killing her would ?
death for victoria would be merciful .
she has nothing left .
now is the time to let her suffer .
please . i sacrificed my whole life for this moment .
don &apos;t rob me of it .
let &apos;s just walk away from all of this .
i don &apos;t care where we go . i just ...
want a chance to get to know you .
i &apos;d like that .
then let &apos;s go .
i just need a week or so to tie up some loose ends .
stay with me until then ?
do you remember how happy we were
when we first moved here ?
thought it was heaven .
the devil can have it .
all right , buddy . have a good day .
say , &quot; bye @-@ bye , daddy ! &quot;
bye , daddy .
bye .
how you doin &apos; there ?
jack porter . right ?
that &apos;s right .
douglas taylor .
agent kate taylor is my daughter .
how can i help you ?
chief alvarez tells me
you two are working on something together .
i was hoping you could shed some light on a few things .
sure .
bureau said that , uh ...
she took a vacation just after she closed your case .
we wrapped up a few days back .
have you seen her since ?
no .
why ?
you think she took a vacation around here ?
well ...
it sure as hell wasn &apos;t miami .
you &apos;re a father .
hate to tell you ,
the worry never ends .
you protect him ...
while you can .
we have a problem .
where &apos;s lyman ?
on my yacht , getting into his tennis whites .
he &apos;ll be back shortly .
says he wants to hear all about my life in the hamptons .
so when he asked you about going home ,
that &apos;s really code for another stint in a mental facility , right ?
i really need him to see how well i &apos;m doing here
so i can stay .
we &apos;ll convince him at dinner tonight .
but whatever happens , you can &apos;t leave .
we &apos;re only halfway through our summer of debauchery .
amen .
nolan .
morning , ems .
um , louise , this is emily thorne ,
my other partner in crime .
so nice to finally meet you .
you , too .
you know , i was real sorry to hear about ...
what happened with daniel .
he was one of my first friends here in the hamptons .
yeah . mine , too .
well , i better run and reserve a court .
bye for now .
bye .
you okay ?
better . i spoke to my dad .
i talked him out of it .
what is the world coming to ?
you spared victoria &apos;s life ? again ?
as many times as i &apos;ve considered it ,
you know that death was never my intention . and ...
too much blood has been shed ,
daniel &apos;s included .
so ...
for my father &apos;s sake and mine ,
we &apos;re gonna leave the hamptons .
ems , you &apos;re finally gonna get your happy ending .
i &apos;m really gonna miss you .
oh , please . you &apos;re already hobnobbing with hot redheads .
gentlemen prefer blondes .
you know that .
i &apos;m just trying to help louise deal with her brother .
wait . lyman ellis is in town ?
oh , yeah .
he came to slap her hand for that lemarchal article .
but you know politicians .
all &apos;s forgiven with the right donation .
but you don &apos;t think that &apos;s all he wants .
i don &apos;t trust the guy .
he has a strange effect on louise , almost like ...
she &apos;s scared of him .
god , i would love a second opinion .
would you join us for dinner tonight ?
if you need me , i &apos;m there .
depending on how things unfold ,
this could become your farewell takedown .
david ?
i think i was wrong .
about what ? tonight ?
yeah . my mind is still all over the place ,
and you need time with daniel &apos;s memories .
and you wanna be with your daughter .
yeah . i do .
i understand .
if this is going to happen ,
it &apos;s not something we can force .
i know . thank you .
i &apos;ll call you later .
how the hell is this happening ?
i thought they i.d.ed his body in miami .
he must &apos;ve realized it was a trap .
and what , he faked his own death ?
what did he say ? what does he know ?
he knows where i live and that i have a son ,
who &apos;s now staying with my cousins
till we can figure out how the hell to take care of this .
no . you need to proceed as normal .
just go to work . don &apos;t arouse suspicion .
don &apos;t call me . they &apos;ll be tracing my number .
i &apos;ll contact you .
and , jack ,
don &apos;t go near amanda .
as far as malcolm knows , she &apos;s dead .
we need to keep it that way until this is over .
all right .
i &apos;m glad you called . how you holding up ?
okay , considering .
i &apos;m sorry that , um ,
that i got emotional in the interrogation .
that &apos;s not really like me .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry if i pushed you .
i was just doing my job .
so is the investigation over ?
yeah . chief closed it yesterday .
as he should have .
in general , alvarez has a tendency
to move quickly on those things .
i do a meeting with him today to talk about a promotion .
for detective ?
that &apos;s great . and -- and long overdue , i &apos;m sure .
yeah . kinda like that date you still owe me .
you know ...
to be honest , i would like that .
but , um ,
i might be heading out of town soon .
all right . so when you &apos;re back then .
i told you , lyman , i &apos;m fine .
i found these on your yacht .
label says it was filled last month ,
but this bottle is more than half @-@ full .
because they don &apos;t help .
louise , dr. silverman says if you &apos;re not medicated ,
you &apos;re not only endangering yourself ,
you &apos;re endangering everyone around you .
what would your friend nolan say
if he knew about your obsessive tendencies ?
and how we fought to keep you out of jail ?
stop that . i wouldn &apos;t hurt nolan .
you never mean to hurt anyone , louise .
you &apos;re just not stable enough to be living on your own .
now at supper tonight ,
i wanted to tell your friends how you decided to come home .
okay , now if you don &apos;t do it , i will ,
and i will make sure they know exactly why .
thank you for coming by .
i can only hope you &apos;ve asked me here
to finally tell me what happened to daniel .
actually , i wanted to show you this .
things he kept from when he was a child .
i started to go through them today ,
but i ...
every morning ,
i wake up , and for a brief moment ...
barely a second ...
i &apos;m happy .
as if sleep has allowed me to forget .
but then it hits me .
and that moment ,
when i remember ...
it &apos;s the worst part of my day .
i want him here .
me , too .
but we &apos;ll get through this together , margaux .
will we ?
of course . we &apos;re family .
i thought we were .
but then why would you put me through such hell ?
what am i supposed to say to my child ?
to your grandchild ?
that their father died assaulting an innocent woman ?
daniel &apos;s death
is not how we will remember his life .
this is .
and you will pass these things along to your baby .
the only thing i want to give my child
is the truth .
nolan ?
oh , i &apos;m trying to decide what to wear tonight ...
something that says southern comfort
without too much twang .
i just left the club .
i overheard louise and her brother arguing .
yeah . she called me and told me all about it .
seems lyman went a little sybil on her after i left .
but i told her that i would talk him down tonight .
what ?
did you know that louise was institutionalized ?
claremont ?
a place that you know full well
has a history of confining sane people against their will .
i actually think it &apos;s in their brochure .
lyman also talked about
obsessive tendencies , violent outbursts .
nolan ...
okay , what ?
there was a little snafu in the steam room .
she locked margaux inside ... allegedly .
what ? !
allegedly .
is that what he was referring to
when he said they were fighting to keep her out of jail ?
no , he was probably referring to whatever &apos;s inside
her criminal file that i hacked .
you have her criminal file ?
yes , but , ems ... ems ,
i am trying to protect her privacy .
i &apos;m protecting you .
according to this , she was charged with assault and battery .
her ex @-@ roommate ended up in a coma .
clearly , her family wanted this sealed so people wouldn &apos;t know
how dangerous she is .
okay , i get it .
you think i &apos;m making another self @-@ destructive choice .
no , it &apos;s more that i &apos;m wondering why you &apos;re turning such a blind eye .
because i believe she &apos;s a good person
who &apos;s had a hard life .
does that sound familiar ?
okay , louise ... mm , may be crazy ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean
my instincts about her or her brother are wrong .
i &apos;ve gone along on your hunches time and again .
come on , ems .
will you go with me on this one ?
yo , you didn &apos;t see alvarez when you came in this morning , did you ?
supposed to have a meeting with him ,
talk about a promotion .
he blew me off .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;s messing with me , do you ?
are you even listening to me ?
i am . i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m trying to check in on carl .
i thought you were taking a couple personal days .
it &apos;s margaux lemarchal .
it &apos;s the third time she &apos;s called me today .
she will not let this daniel grayson thing rest .
what do you mean ?
she &apos;s hell @-@ bent on proving
that emily did not kill him in self @-@ defense .
but not only is the case closed ,
there &apos;s no way that emily is a killer .
dispatch trying to get a 10 @-@ 20 on alvarez .
get in line .
patrol available to check his house ?
copy that .
you always were a tentative little pissant ,
weren &apos;t you , david ?
see , my daughter knows to talk first .
so this better be a courtesy call
telling me that you found her phone .
if you wanna see her again , you &apos;ll do exactly as i say .
you have had two years to plot your revenge on me .
is this really how you wanna play it ?
as your ill @-@ conceived trap in miami proved ,
you &apos;re way out of your league , boy .
although i did lose one of my men .
by my count , you &apos;re down four ,
and i don &apos;t think you wanna make it five .
if you dare harm my daughter ...
kate &apos;s fine .
for now .
let me talk to her .
let me see .
how did you respond when i asked you exactly the same question ?
david .
i know you &apos;re worried about your darling amanda ,
but i have some good news .
she found some gainful employment .
where did you get these ?
i took them .
stayed for the whole show .
and why wouldn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;d have been so proud , david .
the things that she does ...
stay away from her , you son of a bitch !
i &apos;m finished . i want out .
yeah ? where you gonna go ?
you &apos;re a wanted man .
and i saved your life .
those pictures are just a reminder
that every second that you work for me ,
you &apos;re saving hers .
trust me when i say , david ,
she &apos;s worth it .
because of you ,
i never had a chance to say good @-@ bye to my daughter .
maybe i should return the favor .
and what about the ones that you cared for ?
like victoria ?
or your beloved little grandson ?
i think it &apos;s worth kate &apos;s life .
i &apos;m listening .
i &apos;ll send you her location tonight .
when you have it you will leave the country immediately
and i &apos;ll never hear from you again .
if not , the authorities get that flash drive ,
it will be over for both of you .
do we have a deal ?
do i have a choice ?
good evening , gentlemen .
miss thorne , what a nice surprise .
i do hope mr. ross has not twisted your arm
to attend on my account .
my mama taught me better .
i hate to be rude , but ...
not at all .
i can &apos;t imagine how busy you must be
just weeks away from being elected to congress .
from your lips . excuse me .
frankly , my dear ,
i am so glad you give a damn ,
because after 20 minutes of schmoozing ,
i still can &apos;t tell if he deserves
a &quot; brother of the year &quot; award
or the red sharpie .
is your revenge @-@ y sense tingling ?
it &apos;s too early to tell .
where &apos;s louise ?
she went to go freshen up ages ago .
ems , she &apos;s so nervous .
i &apos;ll go check on her .
louise virginia ellis ,
pull yourself together .
what would mama say if she saw you like this ?
need some help ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to startle you .
i didn &apos;t know anyone else was in here .
you must &apos;ve heard me talking to myself .
i am positively mortified .
don &apos;t be .
xanax .
calms my nerves .
hey , half the hamptons are on it .
how long you been taking those ?
years .
after i lost my daddy , i @-@ i had a hard time copin &apos; .
these made the pain disappear .
if they could only make my family disappear ...
must be intimidating ,
having a brother in the political spotlight .
it &apos;s not that .
he inherited my father &apos;s southern charm ,
so everybody loves lyman .
but you don &apos;t ?
no , of course i do . he &apos;s my brother .
it &apos;s just , everyone has two faces ,
some more disturbing than others .
i mean , you of all people would know ,
after what happened with danny .
yeah .
well , just goes to show
just can &apos;t judge the honey by looking at the bee .
and i hope you don &apos;t judge me
based on this little interaction .
oh , of course not .
any friend of nolan &apos;s ...
alvarez never showed today .
according to malcolm , that &apos;s who sent him to me .
you don &apos;t think he ...
i wouldn &apos;t put anything past malcolm .
that &apos;s why this has to end .
i &apos;m meeting him here tonight .
what &apos;s your plan ?
i told him that i have his daughter .
what ? you mean alive ?
what happens when he finds out she &apos;s not ?
he won &apos;t .
i told him that i &apos;d text him the location where kate is .
when he arrives , he &apos;ll find me instead .
then i &apos;ll end this .
i want you to know in case anything happens to me ,
so you can tell amanda .
look , david ...
if he knew miami was a trap ,
he &apos;s gonna smell this a mile away .
well , if he does , there &apos;s a flash drive ...
evidence that i &apos;ve accumulated of all his criminal activity .
nolan knows where to find it .
if things go south , just tell him to release it .
why not do that in the first place ?
turn it over to the feds .
i appreciate that after everything ,
you still believe in the justice system , jack ,
but everyone bends the rules when it pays .
or when it suits them .
even you .
catch you later , sir .
see ya .
this is emily . leave a message .
hey , it &apos;s ben .
i know you said you &apos;re leaving town soon ,
but , i &apos;m just getting off of work .
i thought , i &apos;m free tonight . maybe you are , too .
i know it &apos;s getting late , but ...
anyway ...
emily , give me a call . bye .
now i get it .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i could not figure out why you &apos;ve been ignoring my calls ,
but now it makes sense .
you don &apos;t have time to investigate the suspect
because you &apos;re too busy wooing her .
as i told you , the case is closed .
and you know for a fact it was self @-@ defense ?
i questioned emily myself .
yeah , i &apos;m sure you did .
but i imagine her testimony would be ruled invalid
if anyone knew you two were dating .
we are not dating .
whatever it is ,
have your superiors realized you have no objectivity ?
look , you can complain to whomever you want .
they &apos;re all gonna tell you the same thing .
that this precinct is corrupt .
i will find out what happened to daniel ,
even if it means throwing every bit of media at this
until the truth is uncovered .
because it seems everyone else in this town
has gone completely mad ,
accepting emily thorne &apos;s word as gospel .
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m ...
margaux !
margaux ?
get an ambulance here now !
dispatch ...
margaux .
with our national health care in a constant state of flux ,
not enough attention &apos;s being paid to the mental health arena .
did you know an estimated 1 in 5 adults
suffers from some form of mental illness ?
good god . they don &apos;t wanna hear this .
can &apos;t you give it a rest for just one night ?
lyman , i think louise is right .
you have earned a night off . well ...
at least now you have .
oh , with such generous friends ,
it &apos;s no wonder you don &apos;t want to leave .
i appreciate your contribution .
although i have to admit ,
it &apos;s hard for me to hold my tongue .
this subject is so near to my heart ,
considering my sister &apos;s own battle .
that &apos;s enough .
it &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of , louise .
our father , god rest his soul , was an alcoholic .
more like a commode @-@ hugging , knee @-@ walking drunk .
and poor louise was barely 13 years old
when she found him dead at the bottom of our master staircase .
daddy &apos;s little girl .
ever since then , lou &apos;s suffered from depression
and panic attacks and delusions .
it &apos;s all completely manageable ,
but only under constant supervision ,
which i fear she &apos;s not been getting .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
she needs to be locked up for the rest of her pathetic life .
you need to stop your clucking .
pardon me ?
you &apos;re trying to embarrass me
in front of my friends here on purpose .
friends ?
these people are not your friends .
i &apos;m just trying to convey the seriousness of the situation .
louise , what do you keep looking at ?
louise .
it &apos;s okay .
you can see it in their eyes , can &apos;t you ?
they &apos;re starting to understand
what i have known since you were born ,
that you &apos;re a waste of life .
you shut up !
you shut your mouth , mother ! shut up !
okay , she &apos;s having one of her delusions .
i need to get her home .
louise .
i am not a waste . i am not a waste .
daddy loved me and he understood me .
but you , you are the devil !
and so is lyman !
no .
you are the only hell i ever raised !
louise !
nolan . i &apos;m so , so sorry .
it &apos;s all right . you &apos;re fine . you &apos;re fine .
you understand now why i need to get her home .
come on .
i &apos;m sorry .
guess you were right .
actually ...
i think you were .
you sure i can &apos;t get you anything ?
i told you , you don &apos;t need to stay .
i don &apos;t know why the doctor is taking so long .
first time in an america e.r. ?
well , legend has it this cafeteria has
the best worst coffee in town .
can &apos;t pass that up .
anything for you ?
no .
ben ?
thank you .
i &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re relaxing ...
something you need to do more of .
the baby is healthy ,
your panels are normal ,
but your blood pressure
is a little bit higher than i &apos;d like .
you need to de @-@ stress .
easier said than done .
prenatal yoga ,
more sleep ,
lean on your family .
you have anyone in town ?
she does .
why don &apos;t you stay the night and get some rest ?
and i &apos;ll contact your o.b.
i heard about your collapse .
the doctor just said i should avoid stress .
that would include you .
she also said that you need people to lean on .
and whether you accept me as family or not ,
i am here for you .
i see now that i made a mistake .
keeping the truth from you has driven you mad ,
and that &apos;s not fair .
but i need you to promise me
that what i &apos;m about to tell you stays in the family .
i promise .
daniel didn &apos;t die trying to kill emily .
he saved her .
and what i told you about her wasn &apos;t untrue .
she did ruin daniel in a profound way ,
but what i didn &apos;t tell you is why she did it .
and if i &apos;m to come clean ,
and we &apos;re to have no secrets between us ...
i have to start at the beginning
with a damaged little girl named amanda clarke ,
also known as emily thorne .
and that was only the first of her deeply twisted lies .
very kind of you to check on me , but completely unnecessary .
my brother &apos;s right . i need to be home under a doctor &apos;s care .
no , i think that &apos;s the last place you should be .
louise , those pills you &apos;re taking ,
your family doctor sends them to you ?
long as i can remember .
well , you said it was xanax .
and earlier when i saw one ,
i found it strange that it was in a capsule form . so ...
i decided to take it to a pharmacist friend in the city .
turns out that , yes , it &apos;s xanax ...
but it &apos;s compounded with larium .
what &apos;s larium ?
an antimalarial drug .
after all of my years abroad ,
i &apos;ve seen more than one person suffer from the side effects ,
which looked a lot like what we saw tonight ...
paranoid delusions that lead to aggression .
wait .
are you saying ...
your family &apos;s been drugging you .
i think the question is , why ?
what do they have to gain by you seeming crazy ?
as long as i &apos;m incapacitated ,
mother controls the inheritance that daddy left me .
see , she already burned through hers financing lyman &apos;s campaign .
and to think lyman chose mental health funding
as his platform .
no , but we don &apos;t know he &apos;s involved .
louise ...
even the simplest implication would derail his career .
this could &apos;ve killed you , louise .
but it didn &apos;t .
look , i &apos;d really like to keep this between us .
my family &apos;s skeletons belong in the closet .
but i am so grateful to you .
you saved my life and my sanity .
like they say , sanity &apos;s relative ...
unless , of course , your relatives are insane .
well , i &apos;m at least gonna make sure
this dr. silverman is shut down .
what is this ?
i &apos;m so sorry . after everything you &apos;ve done for me ...
where did you get this ?
nolan &apos;s house .
victoria asked me to find it for her .
and in the state i was in , i just wasn &apos;t thinkin &apos; clearly .
yeah , but ... but i &apos;ve never seen this before .
it was in the kitchen in that folder .
kate &apos;s folio .
look , i don &apos;t even know what it means .
i do .
stand down .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i can &apos;t let you do this , david .
say that your plan works .
best case scenario , you take out malcolm ,
but you don &apos;t know how many people he has with him
or who might come looking for him once he &apos;s gone .
you ... you can leave town .
i can &apos;t .
i already thought this through .
this isn &apos;t you .
you don &apos;t know me , not anymore .
not after what malcolm made me do .
i just couldn &apos;t hold on to who i was .
i was losing my mind .
i remember one point , i tried to reach out to amanda , and ...
i wrote her a letter .
this guard said that he &apos;d deliver it for me ...
and then malcolm found out .
he said that
i could choose ...
this man &apos;s life
or your daughter &apos;s .
but choosing wasn &apos;t enough .
he made me do it myself .
he said if i killed all those people on flight 197 , then
i shouldn &apos;t have a hard time killing a dying man .
malcolm was beginning to suspect that
i wasn &apos;t the criminal that he thought i was .
and if i confirmed it ,
he would &apos;ve killed me .
no , please .
no , don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
i was forced to become the man that he needed me to be .
conrad ruined my life ,
but malcolm , he damned my soul to hell .
i &apos;m not gonna be free until he &apos;s dead .
it &apos;s too late , david .
i met with nolan a couple hours ago .
he gave me the code to the safe .
i @-@ i turned in the flash drive , anonymously .
they &apos;re waiting for malcolm outside .
police ! drop your weapons !
get on the ground .
get on your knees !
come on ! you kidding me ?
get on your knees !
now ! do it !
i &apos;m sorry , but if that man is the monster you say he is ,
i &apos;m glad i did what i did .
there was enough evidence on there
to put him away for the rest of his life .
and now you can have the rest of yours .
if you only knew how wrong you are .
thanks for coming over so late , lyman .
oh , no , thank you .
i wanted to apologize for my sister &apos;s behavior .
in some ways , it &apos;s fortunate
you witnessed it in a safe environment ,
but it always breaks my heart to see her like that .
does it ...
just ...
break your heart ?
louise didn &apos;t want me to say anything .
yeah , clearly , you &apos;ve done quite a number on that girl , but ...
well , couldn &apos;t let you slink out of town thinking you &apos;d won .
how could you do it ?
poisoning your own sister for god knows how long .
i don &apos;t know what lies she &apos;s been feeding you , but i ...
no , no , no , i &apos;m talking about the pills
that you &apos;ve been feeding her .
the ones you had compounded with larium ?
what are you talking about ?
lyman , the panic attacks , the hallucinations ...
you caused all of it .
now wait a minute . if what you &apos;re saying is true ,
i need to speak to our family doctor .
i @-@ i need to get to the bottom of this .
and while you work on all that back home on the plantation ,
louise is gonna stay right here .
you wanna challenge me on that ? be my guest .
but , you wouldn &apos;t be the first politician
whose career i &apos;ve ruined .
i appreciate your intention here ,
protecting my sister , i do ,
but i promise you i had nothing to do with this .
yeah , give it up , lyman .
you already lost my vote and my check .
porter , you &apos;re not on third shift , are you ?
no , sir , sarge .
i heard a s.w.a.t. team arrested a guy
named malcolm black earlier .
yeah , sure did . they turned him over to the feds .
but then i heard he was released .
the agent assigned said there was a lack of evidence .
somebody &apos;s head &apos;s gonna roll .
david ?
you sent that text .
yeah , well , when your best friend is a hacker ,
you pick up a few tricks along the way .
what do you want ?
i &apos;ve been asking myself the same question .
i showed you mercy .
i actually had compassion for you
when you lost your son .
and when you blamed his death on me ,
i accepted it .
as you should have .
you seduced and used daniel as if he was nothing ,
you should &apos;ve come after conrad or me --
he wasn &apos;t nothing to me .
and i saw the photo that you had louise steal .
kate was there because of you .
daniel died because of you .
how dare you !
i begged your father to go to the f.b.i. , and he refused .
the only way to appease malcolm was to get kate the money ...
money that you had to save your father !
i had no idea it would escalate .
and i never told her that
you were amanda clarke .
oh , save your breath .
you &apos;re gonna need it to run .
from you ?
from my father .
because once i tell him what you &apos;ve done ,
i &apos;m not gonna be able to stop him .
then don &apos;t ,
because i would rather die than be saved by ...
amanda clarke &apos;s alive .
i came for your father .
look what i found .
this is so much better .
night @-@ night .
