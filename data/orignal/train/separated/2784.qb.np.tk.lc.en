can &apos;t get the monkey off your back ?
then put it in your mouth ...
... with monkeyshine beer !
get it , monkey
get it , get it , monkey
monkey , monkey
monkeyshine beer .
because it &apos;s a jungle out there !
that commercial always makes me so sad .
but then the guy opens his beer and girls run at him ...
... so everything works out okay .
i meant because the monkey reminds me of marcel .
i can see that .
because they both have those big brown eyes and the little pouty chin .
and the fact that they &apos;re both monkeys ?
i wonder if i did the right thing , giving him away .
ross , you had to . he was humping everything in sight .
my malibu barbie will no longer be wearing white to her wedding .
remember when he &apos;d borrow your hat ...
... and when you got it back , there &apos;d be monkey raisins in it ?
he loved that joke
when he did it , it was funny . when i did it to my boss &apos;s hat ....
suddenly , i had this big &quot; attitude problem . &quot;
the one with the super bowl
hey , check it out ! guess what i got ?
rhythm ?
no . my first fan mail !
&quot; dear dr. ramoray :
i love you and would do anything to have you . &quot;
my gosh ! &quot; your not @-@ so @-@ secret admirer , erika ford . &quot;
oh , wait .
&quot; p.s. enclosed , please find 14 of my eyelashes . &quot;
in crazy world , that means you &apos;re married .
it &apos;s not addressed to days of our lives . this came to your apartment .
she was in our building .
oh , my god .
i got my very own stalker !
you &apos; re so lucky.i have to share with guys at work .
remember we talked about &quot; good thing , bad thing &quot; ? . this is a bad thing .
hey , guys .
hey .
where are you off to ?
there &apos;s a paleontology conference in l.a.
so i figured i &apos;d go and drive down to the zoo and surprise marcel .
he will be surprised . till he realizes he &apos;s a monkey ...
... and isn &apos;t capable of that emotion .
phoebe ? that really cute guy is here again .
okay , so everyone ...
... pretend i &apos;m telling you a story and it &apos;s really funny .
so everyone just laugh . now !
i know , i know !
i &apos;m rob donan .
hi , rob donan .
i don &apos;t know anything about music , but i think you &apos;re really great .
anyway , i schedule performers for children &apos;s libraries .
and i was thinking , have you thought about playing your songs for kids ?
i would love to have kids ...
... hear me play the songs that i will write for them .
what do we do for dinner ?
we could cook for ourselves .
it &apos;s erika .
my god . the stalker !
never mind . it &apos;s open .
hitting her with a frying pan is a good idea .
but we want a backup plan , just in case she isn &apos;t a cartoon !
let &apos;s get out of here !
the one time they &apos;re not home !
we &apos;ll leave . when we pass her ...
... she won &apos;t know me , because we never met !
that &apos;s how radio stars escape stalkers !
she &apos;s coming !
it &apos;s me .
this is it . this is how we &apos;re gonna die .
you ready ?
wait , wait , wait !
brooke shields
erika !
mr. geller ?
yes , hi .
dean lipson , zoo administrator .
you had a question ?
i can &apos;t find the monkey i donated last year . he &apos;s a capuchin ...
... answers to the name marcel ?
i &apos;m afraid i have some bad news .
marcel has passed on .
oh , my god . what happened ?
he got sick , and then he got sicker ...
... and then he got a little better .
but then he died .
i can &apos;t believe this !
i &apos;m sorry , mr. geller . but you know , there &apos;s an old saying :
&quot; sometimes monkeys die . &quot;
it &apos;s not a great saying ...
... but it certainly is fitting today .
someone should &apos;ve called me .
i &apos;m sorry .
look , i know this can &apos;t bring him back ...
... but here , it &apos;s just a gesture .
zoo dollars ?
yes , and come see the bird show at 4 . the macaws wear hats .
it &apos;s a lot cuter if your monkey hasn &apos;t just died .
i know .
i can &apos;t believe joey &apos;s having lunch with his stalker !
what is she like ?
you remember kathy bates in misery ?
well , she looks the exact opposite of that .
and she &apos;s not crazy ?
oh , no , no . she &apos;s a total whack @-@ job .
she thinks that joey is actually dr. drake ramoray .
oh , my god !
and he &apos;s going out with her ?
he cannot pursue this .
just because this woman sees joey through the magical box ...
... in her living room doesn &apos;t mean she &apos;s not a person .
does she not deserve happiness ? does she not deserve love ?
why are you looking at me ? he &apos;s the one who wants to boff the maniac !
are you okay ?
no . i &apos;m just nervous .
maybe if i just picture them all in their underwear ....
that &apos;s not a good idea . that &apos;s the reason the last guy got fired .
i &apos;m used to playing for grownups .
grownups drink their coffee and do their grownup thing .
and kids ...
... iisten .
it &apos;s just a huge responsibility .
what ?
are you gonna kiss me ?
i was thinking about it .
alrighty ! let &apos;s play some tunes !
let &apos;s go find our seats.chandler ? .
hold on a second .
he thinks he can .
oh , what the hell ? .
he can .
hi , everybody . i &apos;m phoebe .
hi , phoebe !
i &apos;m gonna play some songs about grandparents , okay ?
now grandma &apos;s a person who everyone likes
she bought you a train and a bright shiny bike
but lately she hasn &apos;t been coming to dinner
and last time you saw her she looked so much thinner
now your mom and your dad said she moved to peru
but the truth is she died and someday you will too
i &apos;ll have the grilled salmon .
and the doctor will have the risotto
oh , drake , isn &apos;t it amazing ?
yeah , it is .
what ?
well , here we sit , devil @-@ may @-@ care ...
... and a while ago you were reattaching simone &apos;s spinal cord .
that was a tricky one .
in reality ...
... that operation takes 10 hours . but they only showed it for 2 minutes .
who &apos;s &quot; they &quot; ?
no one .
drake , you are so talented . let me see those hands .
oh , these hands , these beautiful hands .
i could just eat them .
but i won &apos;t .
otherwise my watch would fall off .
no , seriously .
these hands ...
... these miracle , magical , life @-@ giving hands .
just to be near them , touch them , maybe even lick one ?
all right . just one .
you &apos;re good at that .
oh , my god ! someone ! he &apos;s choking !
is anyone here a doctor ?
yes , the best doctor in salem !
dr. drake ramoray !
meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes .
hey , look . i don &apos;t really enjoy being with other men that way .
but , zoo dollars ?
it &apos;s about your monkey !
it &apos;s alive .
i don &apos;t understand . why didn &apos;t you help that man ?
because i &apos;m a neurosurgeon ...
... and that was clearly a case of ...
... &quot; foodal chokage . &quot;
i gotta tell you something
you don &apos;t have to tell me anything .
you don &apos;t have to explain yourself to me .
who am i to question the great dr. drake ramoray ?
i should be happy to be near you .
hey , l
hey what ?
that &apos;s it . just hey !
like at the end of a dance . hey !
there &apos;ll be times when you get older
when you &apos;ll want to sleep with people
just to make them like you but don &apos;t !
&apos;cause ...
... that &apos;s another thing ...
... that you don &apos;t wanna do everybody !

and you know why ? because you told the truth .
nobody ever tells kids the truth .
you were incredible !
but ... ?
how &apos;d you know there was a &quot; but &quot; ?
i sense these things .
it was either &quot; but &quot; or &quot; butter . &quot;
the thing is , i think some of the parents ...
... they were hoping that ...
... you &apos;d play more songs about barnyard animals .
i can do that .
really ?
because that would be fantastic !
what ? you wanna kiss me ?
i &apos;m thinking about it .
if i get a library card , can i take you out some time ?
what ? i &apos;m unemployed

ambassador of darkness .
flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger .
sightless specter of the macabre .

... a few months back . inside job .
your monkey was taken .
along with a snowy egret , a two @-@ toed sloth ...
... and three sweatshirts from the zoo gift shop .
the zoo told me that my monkey was dead !
the zoo !
you believe everything the zoo tells you ?
that &apos;s the only thing the zoo &apos;s ever told me .
of course they &apos;ll say that ! they don &apos;t want the bad publicity .
it &apos;s all a great big cover @-@ up .
do you have any idea how high up this thing goes ?
that guy lipson ?
lipson knows ?

are you trying to get me to bribe you ?
maybe .
but you already told me everything .
