fish on !
i &apos;m starving .
good morning .
what are you looking for ?
a piece of bread or a muffin .
in your world , a croissant .
carbs .
yes .
empty calories .
bingo .
well , you &apos;re not gonna find anything ,
&apos;cause your mother is on a new diet .
well , that still involves food , right ?
i never slept better .
we were wondering .
feel my hair -- thick , right ?
feels hairy .
silky .
thank you .
don &apos;t bother . there &apos;s no food in there .
nothing white .
is this a goal ...
for ... humans ... that eat food ?
there &apos;s a scientific basis for it .
no white rice , no white flour , no white sugar .
pop @-@ tarts ?
well -- well , it &apos;s browne flour , when you cook them .
is that what i taught you ?
yes !
you taught me that food is fuel . grab it , go .
well , then , i &apos;m sorry .
there &apos;s a healthier way to eat that makes you feel better .
and this is it .
ma , you look great . you don &apos;t need to go on a diet .
thank you , baby , but i &apos;m not doing it to diet or lose weight .
i do it to have more energy .
yeah , and eating more colorful fruits and vegetables
increases our intake of phytochemicals ,
which is linked to decreased rates of
heart disease , cancer , and diabetes .
et voila .
you guys expect a lot out of your food .
i just expect mine to get me from breakfast to lunch .
and this diet will do it .
it &apos;s gluten @-@ free muesli , berries , and non @-@ fat yogurt .
what color &apos;s your yogurt ?
i could make you french toast .
you wouldn &apos;t even know it was kale .
gross , ma .
rizzoli .
isles .
got to go , ma .
i &apos;m gonna bring you a snack at work .
chocolate cake !
oh , god . really ?
what ? it &apos;s not white .
why is it that when someone wants to make
a major life change , they go on a diet ?
well , don &apos;t you feel better when you eat better ?
yes , when i have the right amount of
sugar and caffeine and alcohol , i feel amazing .
okay , so , cupcakes , red bull , and a martini .
you don &apos;t have to get all fancy with it .
i &apos;d take coffee and a shot of whisky any day .
anybody would have answered gordie howe .
i didn &apos;t specify american hockey .
what &apos;s up ?
oh , frankie lost a bet , and i get to pick his punishment .
but you &apos;re probably talking about the crime scene , though .
i got the vic &apos;s keys .
i &apos;m gonna go check the lot for his car .
canadian hockey .
the victim is mark harris , 32 .
took a single arrow to the back .
actually , a bolt . from a crossbow .
a bolt is smaller than an arrow , and it &apos;s metal .
this is likely from a pistol grip .
it &apos;s easy to get , easy to hide .
a shooter would need to be within 35 yards
for an accurate shot .
any other injuries ?
well , it looks like some bruising
from the fall after being shot .
he was competing in a very
important regional bass @-@ fishing tournament .
really ? very important ?
winner here gets $ 100,000 and goes to the nationals .
top prize there is $ 500,000 .
very imporant it is .
he was in the lead .
with what he had in his tank ,
it would have been very difficult for anybody to beat him .
crossbow &apos;s kind of perfect for the environment .
i mean , it &apos;s completely quiet .
and not unusual for an outdoorsman to have one .
he has a sunburn on one side of his face .
so it &apos;s likely he was dead in the boat for hours .
i &apos;m surprised none of the other fishermen saw him .
well , the water &apos;s too shallow for bass here .
nobody would have come by .
what is it ?
this blood pooling . something &apos;s not right .
what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m gonna have to investigate further .
surprise , surprise .
hey , jane . you there ?
yeah , i found his car .
okay . i &apos;ll be right there .
this is the car mark harris drove ?
yeah .
doesn &apos;t really fit in , does it ?
i &apos;m guessing mark harris didn &apos;t really fit in either .
according to tournament officials ,
he was a college professor -- taught poetry .
oh , well , that &apos;s the perfect training
for becoming a fisherman .
i know . it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it also doesn &apos;t make sense that he was leading the tournament .
the emergency contact on his phone is his wife , carla .
i &apos;ll give her a call .
okay .
jane ?
yeah ?
this is skeet martin .
he was fisng in the competition .
he wants to talk to you . only you .
this is detective rizzoli . excuse me .
do you know something about what happened here this morning ?
uh , no .
did you know mark harris ?
no , ma &apos;am .
so , why did you need to talk to me ?
well , i tried to hire a skywriter with my cellphone ,
but i couldn &apos;t seem to get any reception .
a skywriter ?
to ask you out to dinner .
that &apos;s it ?
and to watch the sunset .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
hey , we don &apos;t have to talk about fishing .
i -- or we can talk about fishing ,
if it &apos;ll help your case .
is it the air ? is it the trees ?
there &apos;s just group insanity going --
what are you doing ?
fish scales .
well , can you sniff the tires and tell me where the car &apos;s been ?
it &apos;s addressed to mark . probably harris .
&quot; say anything , and you &apos;ll sleep with these . &quot;
that &apos;s not very original .
somebody threatened him . he didn &apos;t take it seriously .
well , he had about 100,000 reasons not to .
same number of reasons somebody would had to want him dead .
mark was a college professor -- elizabethan poetry .
he loved it .
when he was denied tenure , it was an enormous blow .
what happened after he lost his job ?
he looked and looked for another .
when he couldn &apos;t find one , he fell apart .
so did our marriage .
we filed for divorce .
how did he get involved with , uh , competitive fishing ?
he went up to maine to a friend &apos;s cabin by a lake
to clear his head
and work on his long @-@ neglected book of poetry .
but mark had writer &apos;s block .
so , one day ,
mark went fishing to take the pressure off
and found out he was a natural .
the fish just ... came to him .
he entered a tournament and won .
and he won tournament after tournament .
when was the last time you saw your husband ?
the first day of the tournament .
um , i brought him the divorce papers
so he could sign them and embrace his new life .
and did he ?
no .
he ripped up the papers .
this was to be his last tournament .
he wanted to come back home .
well , mrs. harris , thank you for coming in .
and , um , we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
if you think of anything else ...
uh , mark did mention one name .
um , the woman who made his lures --
linda hendrickson -- she was his confidante .
i &apos;m sorry to ask , but do you happen to know
the nature of their relationship ?
friends .
i think .
we were separated when they met ,
so if it was something else , that &apos;s okay .
god , it doesn &apos;t matter now .
none of this matters now .
hi . is the autopsy done yet ?
uh , kent &apos;s finishing up the report .
so , do you want the bad news or the bad news ?
mm , you pick .
the threatening note to mark harris
was on standard paper , with standard ink ,
using a standard printer .
there are no fingerprints .
what &apos;s the bad news ?
no prints . no markings .
this is a standard 436 @-@ gram bolt
fired from a 350 @-@ foot @-@ per @-@ second crossbow .
conclusion -- we have nothing .
ding , ding , ding !
what &apos;s with the fish tanks ?
uh , they were in mark &apos;s live well ,
so they &apos;re evidence -- i brought them back here ,
but now i don &apos;t really know what to do with them .
this one likes me .
he &apos;s probably swimming toward his reflection .
can &apos;t he just like me ?
fish are actually drawn to changes in light .
sports @-@ fishing boats sometimes use bright lights
to draw them to the surface .
you fish , kent ?
only for food . same way i hunt .
did you hunt and skin your belt ?
of course .
the autopsy report on mark harris .
oh , he seems lovely .
yeah , i am not sure i understand what &apos;s going on with that guy .
i keep telling you to throw him back in .
or hunt him .
maura ?
mark was on coumadin .
oh , the blood thinner ?
he bled out quickly .
so , any wound would have been fatal
if he didn &apos;t get help right away .
it also means the shooter
didn &apos;t have to be good . he just had to hit him .
which means the shot could have been fired
from as far away as 60 yards .
which means we have a lot more suspects .
there were 60 contestants .
i used each boat &apos;s gps trackers to narrow the search
to boats within crossbow range of the victim
at the estimated time and place of death .
better .
the m.e. also sent up forecasts of the bullet trajectory .
i &apos;m gonna input those
and see if it eliminates a few more boats .
great .
i &apos;ll check back in with you later .
time to pay off your bet . meet your flour baby .
you have to take care of that as if it &apos;s your very own baby .
it &apos;s how they teach responsibility to teenagers .
while you &apos;re in the station ,
care for that as if it &apos;s your very own .
for how long ?
one day . be a good dad .
every time you &apos;re not , i add a day .
this is silly , but easy .
we &apos;ll see .
oh , i got this .
we &apos;ll see .
linda hendrickson &apos;s dad was a champion fisherman .
she grew up on lakes across new england .
doesn &apos;t seem like much of a love connection
for an ex @-@ professor of elizabethan poetry .
strange thing , love .
oh , do enlighten me .
i would , but we &apos;re here .
come in !
hi . um , i &apos;m detective jane rizzoli .
this is detective vince korsak .
yeah , hi . linda . just give me a sec .
i &apos;m ... baking . sorry about the smell .
no , no . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s , uh - horrible .
they &apos;re very effective , but they stink .
um ... we , uh -- we wanted to talk about mark harris .
oh , yeah .
yeah . it &apos;s so sad . it &apos;s just a tragedy .
um , wh @-@ what was the status of your relationship ?
well , at first , i thought he was just lonely --
or horny , like they get after eight hours on the lake .
but , uh , you know , it turns out
he was a sponge for knowledge about fishing .
so , he was a customer ?
at first .
then ... well , after eight hours in this kitchen ,
it makes me want some air and some contact .
how long were you two together ?
not long . i broke it off .
mark wasn &apos;t my kind of guy .
i got to say , i &apos;m surprised he was your kind of guy
even for a little while .
it &apos;s tough for me to meet men .
you &apos;re surrounded by men .
so are you .
does that make it easier ?
was there anyone you know that might have wanted to harm mr. harris ?
that &apos;s a list of everyone in the tournament .
they were all jealous of mark . they accused him of cheating .
did he cheat ?
oh , mark didn &apos;t know enough to cheat .
unlike everyone on that list .
so you &apos;re saying they &apos;re all cheaters ?
a fisherman &apos;s just a cheater who hasn &apos;t been caught .
it &apos;s another reason i don &apos;t date fishermen .
except mark harris .
well , he was a poet ... who fished .
my next batch is a really smelly one .
well , uh , thank you for your time .
can i keep this ?
sure .
no wonder the only empty spot on the lot is next to that .
mark harris doesn &apos;t strike me as the kind of guy
that would have have two beautiful ,
but totally different women in his life .
well , women can see past looks .
yeah . men can &apos;t .
no , that &apos;s why we wear makeup and heels .
because you all like the shiny stuff .
detective rizzoli ! hi .
hello .
i , uh -- i brought you a gift .
to help you with your case .
thank you .
it &apos;s a book on bass .
and a split of champagne .
now , you can have that yourself or bring it down to my boat .
we can drink it together , watch the sunset , and talk fish .
skeet , i @-@ i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . i --
this is business . but , please , think about it .
hey , this is skeet .
shiny jacket .
shiny .
you rang ?
yes .
there is something very interesting about the big fish
that was found in mark &apos;s livewell when he died .
is that the fish that kept swimming toward me ?
the cute one ?
yes .
you killed him because you were jealous .
well , he was sick .
which is why he kept swimming around repetitively
and banging into the glass .
sick with love !
well , i cured him .
the dna of the stomach contents
shows that this fish is not from this pond .
and it ate plants not from this region .
and he was bigger than the bass found in this pond .
so , either mark found out someone was cheating --
or mark was cheating .
give my friend a proper burial .
do you like fish tacos ?
what ?
where &apos;s frankie jr . jr . ?
i had him with me , ran down to the car ,
then nina called and --
you left him in the car ?
yeah .
in a car seat ?
no .
with the windows rolled down ?
no .
poor frankie jr . jr. gone too soon .
another day with a flour baby for you .
what ? !
another day .
no way . come on , kor--
factoring in wind speed and distance the bolt would travel ,
we &apos;re left with these three suspects .
boyd jones , cliff davis , jay butler .
and all three were in striking distance of first place .
jones and davis have been brought in .
jay butler left the tournament early .
do we know where he is ?
no , but he &apos;s signed up for a tournament in northern maine .
right near the canadian border .
yeah , i &apos;ll put a bolo out on him .
okay .
korsak &apos;s making me --
i don &apos;t want to know .
boyd jones and cliff davis are ready for questioning .
fun fact -- they were both caught cheating in the past .
we &apos;ll interview them .
let me know what you find out .
n @-@ nina ? would you mind keeping an eye on francesca for me ?
sure .
how did you come up with &quot; francesca &quot; ?
seriously ?
no .
did you know mark harris ?
we fished in the same tournaments .
if you call what he was doing &quot; fishing . &quot;
brand @-@ new to the sport ,
but he &apos;d won three of the last eight tournaments .
yeah , the guy &apos;s a poet .
were you friends with mark harris ?
&quot; friends &quot; ? are you kidding me ?
he combs our lakes .
he takes our fish . he takes our women .
uh , you mean , uh , linda hendrickson ?
i asked her out four times .
yeah , she thought she was better than me .
sounds like that bothered you big time .
did he figure out you were cheating ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
oh , come on , sport .
two tournaments ago ,
one of the fish you &quot; caught &quot; was partially frozen .
nature &apos;s mysterious .
you put weights down the throats of your fish .
allegedly .
uh , y @-@ you had a secret storage compartment in your boat .
i say it was a cooler for beer .
do you own a crossbow ?
of course .
don &apos;t you ?
listen , i hope
that you catch whoever it is that killed this guy .
and i hope you figure out how he cheated .
what makes you think he cheated ?
what do you think ? fish just jumping into his boat ?
when you do ...
would you tell me how he was doing it ?
on the sly ?
i won &apos;t tell anyone .
um , can you tell me
where i might find detective jane rizzoli ?
her desk is in the squad room .
okay . thanks .
are you , uh -- are you working on that , uh , mark harris murder ?
i need you to leave .
&apos;cause i was in that tournament . so , if you need any --
sir , i &apos;m in the middle of important police business ,
thanks for watching francesca for me .
i am gonna keep this flour baby alive .
i &apos;m not gonna give korsak the satsifa--
there was a bet and ...
well , you know , good luck
with that important police business .
linda was right .
it was a lake full of cheaters and wannabe cheaters
and cheaters who haven &apos;t been caught yet .
bassholes .
you kiss your daughter with that mouth ?
nice lamp .
oh . yeah , the department &apos;s redecorating .
you get the matching chair .
how &apos;s the puzzle ?
i feel like a piece is missing out of the box .
mark harris made a $ 50,000 deposit
the day before the tournament started .
what ?
from big rod &apos;s sporting goods .
they hired mark to be their spokesman
for their competition fishing line .
okay , this whole fishing thing --
i know , i &apos;ve got to redo my profile on match.com
to add &quot; pro fishermen welcome . &quot;
wait a minute , after the tournament started ,
he withdrew $ 50,000 -- what &apos;s up with that ?
i don &apos;t know .
he got a money order for cash . maybe it &apos;s some sort of payoff .
the same day he was killed ?
the same day jay butler disappeared .
did you know that because of all the pollution ,
the bass are changing sexes ,
with the males carrying the eggs ?
oh . it &apos;s about time .
you did not know that .
yes , i did .
i read it in a science journal . you ?
i read it in that book skeet gave me .
interesting .
skeet ?
the book .
and the picture ...
he drew .
he put a sex drawing in a fish book ?
what is wrong with you ?
no , he drew a picture of me fishing .
it &apos;s very flattering .
waders are a nice look on you .
okay , what are we searching for , again ?
evidence that the fish i autopsied was transported to
and somehow held in this lake .
which might help us figure out who planted it there .
and that would lead us to the killer .
we discussed all this in the car .
did we ?
oh , i see . you just needed a break , didn &apos;t you ?
no .
okay .
i was just recapping .
why can &apos;t we do this with a motor ?
because it will scare the fish ,
and fear does not equal attraction ,
which is what &apos;s so interesting about skeet .
he &apos;s not afraid of you .
well , i &apos;m not interested in skeet .
because you &apos;re afraid .
i am not afraid of skeet .
no , you &apos;re just afraid that skeet doesn &apos;t look like
what you thought you were looking for .
well , i &apos;m not sure what i &apos;m looking for ,
but i can tell you one thing -- it &apos;s not skeet .
and if i have to look at that jacket --
wait ! stop !
what ? you got to talk .
how come i don &apos;t get to say anything ?
no , no , no . no , no .
what ?
look . look , look , look .
yeah . okay .
okay .
do not let me slip .
careful .
i think i know what those clips held .
big , big bass .
tell me why you left the tournament early .
because of the thing with mark .
the &quot; thing &quot; ? you mean his murder ?
yeah . because of that , the tuornament was suspended .
well , you don &apos;t seem very upset about mark harris &apos; death .
we weren &apos;t friends .
i got that .
look , i @-@ i was upset that i wouldn &apos;t be able to fish .
but i didn &apos;t know when it would start again or if it would .
anyway , there -- there was no way i could win , so i @-@ i left .
you finished second to mark harris three times .
first place was $ 100,000 . second place was $ 5,000 .
it had to make you angry .
i don &apos;t play for second .
especially not to mark harris .
you &apos;re damn straight .
it had to make you angry knowing that
he was a better fisherman than you were .
mark harris is a cheater ! all right ? !
okay . tell me how he cheated .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
but he won more than any of us ,
a @-@ and he didn &apos;t know a damn thing about bass fishing .
well , he knew enough to win .
look , rosie ruiz won the boston marathon .
lance armstrong won the tour de france .
fishing is a cruel mistress . nobody wins all the time .
god . mark harris did .
how many years have you been a fisherman ?
my whole life .
and that number will remain private , if you don &apos;t mind .
ever cheated ?
look , sometimes the rules change .
it takes a while to catch up .
i don &apos;t know what mark harris did .
but , if i was you , i would talk to his girlfriend , linda .
ex @-@ girlfriend .
ex ?
yeah . rules change .
maybe .
but someone didn &apos;t like it .
i parked my rv next to linda &apos;s .
i had to move it .
they were fighting all night . i couldn &apos;t sleep .
thanks for coming in .
you think he &apos;s telling the truth ?
well , the spot next to linda &apos;s rv was empty .
could have been the smell .
maybe .
it could also be that this murder
is not about fishing .
korsak ?
yep .
i &apos;m not betting with him anymore .
what did he make you do ?
that &apos;s horrible .
wait a minute . is that korsak &apos;s face ?
on a bolotianyk .
a what ?
a swamp spirit from slavic folklore .
it was supposed to be temporary .
it &apos;s not ?
korsak keeps finding ways to tell me i &apos;ve screwed up .
it &apos;s been redrawn a bunch of times .
how long have you had it ?
six months .
oh , my god .
we should all know better than to bet with korsak .
well , i do now .
wait !
lost a bet , huh ?
hey , korsak ! i &apos;m doing good !
no more days for me !
oh , come on .
let &apos;s not name the next one .
hurts too bad when you fail .
if jane asks , you rowed .
you two have a unique relationship , don &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m still trying to figure it out .
me too .
so , do you know where we &apos;re going ?
the spot where mark caught his last fish .
it still seems strange ,
this whole idea of fishing as a sport .
well , imagine how the fish feel .
do you follow any sports ?
the usual things -- arm wrestling , the caber toss .
i can never tell when you &apos;re joking .
i know .
it &apos;s getting close . right around here .
all right .
there it is .
can you give me a hand ?
got it ?
go ! be free !
until you bite down on some shiny piece of plastic
and somebody with a brightly colored shirt
pulls you from your watery home ,
weighs you , measures you , and flings you back into the air .
is that fish empathy
or another indicator of a bizarre world view ?
um , bit of both , i guess .
this is probably the spot where mark was when he was shot .
now , the bolt entered mark harris &apos; back
just below his neck .
if you were aiming from a boat ,
you would aim for the largest area -- the back .
and at 35 yards , the path would drop about 10 inches .
so if the crossbow was fired from a boat --
then the bolt would have entered the victim &apos;s lower back .
well , that rise is about 50 yards away --
well within range .
starting with that hight aiming over victim &apos;s head ...
the crossbow shot would have dropped about 4 to 6 inches
and lodged itself in the victim &apos;s upper back .
so mark harris was killed by someone standing on the shore .
hey ! garcia ! how are you ?
oh , good . thanks , mrs. rizzoli .
you look hungry .
well , starving , actually .
well , you &apos;re in luck because i baked some goodies .
they &apos;re super healthy .
i made them with cricket flour , hemp , and agave .
yeah , go ahead . take one .
or , i mean , if you can &apos;t decide , take a couple .
i &apos;m on a diet ,
but thanks so much , mrs. rizzoli .
what ? is everybody on a diet around here ?
hey , nina . have you seen frankie ?
no , i haven &apos;t .
angela , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing ,
but you look fantastic .
really ?
really .
i &apos;m on this &quot; nothing white &quot; diet .
it &apos;s really strict .
sounds impressive .
yeah . i hate it .
i mean , all i want is white bread , white pasta ,
and a little sugar sprinkled on top .
i &apos;m sorry . i have to go .
okay . well , it was nice talking to you .
you too .
what the heck ?
mark had a sponsorship deal
with big rod &apos;s sporting goods .
i know .
why is that funny ?
because it &apos;s amazing -- the irony .
mark , he didn &apos;t like to handle fish
when we had a barbecue .
it was a very lucrative deal .
he got a first payment of $ 50,000,
which he withdrew the day that he was killed .
you have any idea what happened to that money ?
i have it .
he asked me to mail the check in for him .
it &apos;s a lot of money .
i know .
mark wanted to prove to me
that he was making a clean break from fishing ,
that he was committed to our marriage .
and we didn &apos;t have financial problems .
does this have something to do with why he was killed ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out .
i don &apos;t understand this . i don &apos;t understand any of this .
thank you for coming in , mrs. harris .
well , somebody &apos;s lying .
carla ?
no . everybody else .
jane !
i &apos;ve got to go do that thing .
jerk .
how do you keep getting in here ?
i &apos;m friendly .
okay .
hey , look .
i have a reservation at providence tonight .
have dinner with me .
there &apos;s a two @-@ week wait to get a table at that place .
well , they knew me . they serve fish .
okay , skeet ...
i don &apos;t want to go out with you .
why ?
because .
okay . i hear you .
i don &apos;t understand it , but i hear you .
i mean , it &apos;s obvious you &apos;re attracted to me .
your respiration is elevated ,
your skin color &apos;s slightly red , your pupils are dilated .
or ... it &apos;s hot and i &apos;m tired
and it &apos;s dark in the hallway .
jane , don &apos;t let your head rule your heart !
goodbye , skeet .
what &apos;s up ?
i remodeled the flight projections
for the crossbow bolt .
given the rate of drop per yard traveled ,
and the height of the entry in the victim &apos;s back --
maura , you &apos;re talking equations .
jane don &apos;t like equations .
the crossbow bolt that killed mark harris
was fired from the shore ,
from a rise just behind the reeds .
that &apos;s a good place to hide .
and the height makes up for the extra drop
with the added distance .
that &apos;s what i was trying to say .
you know , when carla harris talked about mark ,
her breathing was very even , her pupils weren &apos;t dilated .
she was probably grieving .
but when linda hendrickson talked about him ,
she got really red , her breathing was very shallow .
it &apos;s possible that she was still in love with him
and he was going to leave her .
ain &apos;t love grand ?
mark was taking a prescription for blood thinners .
oh , yeah ?
we found this receipt for coumadin .
as it turns out ,
it was your credit card that paid for it .
so ?
so that means you knew about it .
well , i don &apos;t understand where this is going .
mark entered eight tournaments .
you were not an official for two of them ,
where he finished 83rd and 95th .
it happens .
yes , it does .
in the six that did you officiate ,
he won all of them .
so ?
do you own a crossbow ?
everyone owns a crossbow .
well , everyone does not own a set of ws16 snow chains .
that look familiar ?
now , we &apos;re gonna piece all of this together
and trace it back to you .
the matching snow chain . the note you left on his hood
we &apos;ll find a draft on your hard drive .
so ...
what happened , linda ?
he was hopeless .
he was so cute , but he was human fish repellent .
you taught him to cheat ?
no .
so , you &apos;re saying he caught those fish legitimately ?
no .
you cheated for him .
he never knew .
you know , i changed the weights on his tally sheet .
i salted the waters where i knew he &apos;d be fishing .
i snuck extra fish into his bait tank .
see , he was a poet . he saw what he wanted to see .
i just wanted him to be happy .
what changed ?
the endorsement deal
with big rod &apos;s sporting goods .
i mean , we could have been king and queen of the lakes ,
but that wasn &apos;t enough for him .
and that made you angry .
oh , you think ?
they were gonna put mark on the cover
of a sporting @-@ goods catalogue
so that other city guys would buy more fishing rods .
but me , with all of my knowledge ,
i could never get that .
i could never be the face of big rod &apos;s , but he could .
and i did that for him .
i gave that to him .
and he was throwing it all away .
he was going back to his wife .
so you told him about the cheating ?
well , i thought if -- if he knew ,
then he &apos;d realize how much i l @-@ loved him .
but he said that he had to come clean .
confess .
which would have exposed you .
i would have lost everything that i &apos;ve built .
he was so ungrateful .
i mean , he had nothing to lose !
just his life .
uh , jane !
and that is good work .
look , i , uh , just came to say goodbye .
and i &apos;m sorry if ...
i made you feel uncomfortable .
no , skeet , wh -- look --
i @-@ i know we &apos;re not going on a date ,
but would you at least come out on my boat
and watch the sunset with me ?
i just don &apos;t have that kind of time .
10 minutes .
then i &apos;m gone . you &apos;ll never see me again .
10 minutes .
clock it .
you must know an amazing shortcut to the water .
uh , i never said that we were going to the water .
seven minutes .
thank you .
gorgeous .
um , okay . a toast .
to jane , who i will forever be thinking about
when i &apos;m in my boat .
well , i don &apos;t really know about that .
well , i &apos;ll just have you know that this little baby
used to be called the skeetster .
i thought it was bad luck to change the name of a boat .
i don &apos;t believe in luck . i believe in attraction .
give me a call next time you come to boston .
so ... skeet ?
mm . so what ?
well , i think you find him alluring .
respiration increasing , skin beginning to flush .
yes , doctor . i am completely infatuated .
here you are .
i don &apos;t think she understands the laws of attraction .
shall i explain ? i &apos;m sort of an expert .
how is that ?
i &apos;ve been married three times .
so you get them on the line , but ...
they wriggle away .
i got to work on that with kiki .
how much longer do i have to be a flour daddy ?
to be decided -- you killed the first two ,
and you don &apos;t even know where the last one is yet .
enjoy .
they &apos;re white . is that a trick ?
no . vanilla cake , vanilla frosting .
they look great .
yes . i found a bag of flour at the station .
well , i couldn &apos;t resist .
you &apos;re done .
francesco the third , come to papa .
frankie !
with the paper and all ?
