you want me to testify at his bail hearing ?
we need to show the judge that peter will have a safe ,
stable living situation if he &apos;s out on bail , and that
he will be welcomed home .
dad told us he made mistakes .
yeah , but not that .
what &apos;s next for peter florrick ?
i gotta go into that courtroom in the next
few weeks and win this appeal .
bail is hereby denied .
this court is adjourned .
peter didn &apos;t make bail .
my next guest has spent quality time with some
of the biggest political names in chicago politics ,
and she &apos;s working on a shocking tell @-@ all book .
please welcome amber madison .
hi , how are you ?
so nice to meet you .
so this d.a ....
now , did he ... ?
uh , state &apos;s attorney .
okay .
right , whatever , this d.a ....
so now ,
did he , um , suck on your toes all the time
or was that just , like , a one @-@ time shot ?
it was a ... two @-@ time thing .
well , of course ,
i mean , once you shrimp on somebody once ,
you kind of have to follow up with another sucking session .
and what &apos;s the most disgusting thing
that he ever asked you to do to him ?
uh , well ...
like really , really disgusting .
it wasn &apos;t the most disgusting ,
but he ...
kids , breakfast !
this is something new i found at the market .
it &apos;s called fruit .
i thought we &apos;d give it a try this morning .
you &apos;re really happy this morning .
yes , i started drinking earlier .
okay , something is going on .
no , we just have to get to school .
love you , mom .
love you , too .
look , amber madison is yesterday &apos;s news .
thank you .
she &apos;d say anything to sell a book .
it doesn &apos;t warrant a comment .
miss poole , he &apos;s not in court .
i put him in the jury room .
thank you .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll need damage control .
it &apos;s just gossip page fodder .
i &apos;m not getting political calls .
who is she ?
he &apos;s trying his wife .
i usually don &apos;t ask this , but how much is true ?
from what i can tell , not much .
so what are we dealing with ?
a call girl stretching her 15 minutes
to 20 or ... ?
or ... ?
i had a married client who had a girlfriend
who wouldn &apos;t go away .
she kept making trouble at inopportune moments .
we offered her money , a singing contract , everything .
it turns out she wanted
something i couldn &apos;t offer her--
my client .
she was in love with him and she was bitter .
is that a possibility here ?
why don &apos;t you ask him ?
yes .
this is her husband .
could you tell her to call me as quickly as possible ?
thank you .
are you okay ?
no .
that &apos;s good , the genuine is important right now .
kya .
unless you can get me in touch with my wife ,
i think you should shut up .
your husband phoned .
my ... ? oh , did he say what it was about ?
no , but i @-@ i think he thought you &apos;d know what it was about .
and someone from page six--
he phoned , wanting comment .
on ?
he didn &apos;t say .
i don &apos;t think it was about a case .
courtney ,
you got a minute ?
what &apos;s going on ?
courtney .
just wait .
so now we &apos;re getting to a comfortable place . thank you .
now , what kind of code
are we talking about here ?
i &apos;ve called peter &apos;s house
and hang up after one ring , and then he would know
that the next call was going to be from me .
are you 14 ?
no , i mean , you &apos;re a call girl .
i mean , that just sounds pretty ...
anyway , so about that threesome ...
um , it was nothing .
it-- he said that it was the reason
that he came to me in the first place .
his wife wouldn &apos;t agree to a threesome .
i think he thought that she was a little ...
frigid . you can say it .
i mean , everyone-- i @-@ i &apos;ve seen
her , i think she was frigid
i mean , i know frigid
and-- see , there &apos;s a lesson here for everybody .
when your spouse asks you for a threesome ...
and he offered you a job , is that right ?
yes , on his campaign .
um , he said that he was going to divorce his wife
and that i would work as part of his outreach for at @-@ risk kids .
and you believed him ?
i &apos;m sorry , will and diane need you upstairs .
peter was very compassionate ,
um , very loving ,
a very , very good lover .
we need to do damage control .
this is beyond damage control .
don &apos;t let &apos;s get into that now , please .
what ? we can &apos;t just let this sit .
you &apos;re like fletcher christian
just itching to throw bligh overboard .
yes , and mr. christian was the hero .
here .
attorneys at stern , lockhart &amp; gardner
have had no comment on this latest embarrassment .
it appears that jonas stern &apos;s single car accident
caused no injuries .
stern , chicago &apos;s renowned civil rights attorney ,
first gained notoriety crusading against
police brutality in the 1970s .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
guy hasn &apos;t stepped foot in the office for over a year ...
i talked to his ex @-@ wife .
which one ?
cassandra .
she said spending so much time away mellowed him .
yep , like rotting fruit .
remember , he spoke at school ?
he filled hart auditorium , diane ,
on-- what was it ?
universal jurisdiction .
stern used a glass of water and a hammer
to demonstrate the difference between ...
international norms versus state sovereignty .
right , you were really into him .
i found him inspiring .
well , he wanted to thank you .
me ?
yeah .
the slip and fall , his daughter &apos;s defense .
i guess she spoke highly of you .
he &apos;s on his way over .
oh , good , julius kreutzer has agreed to handle the dui .
kreutzer ? great .
we &apos;ll need to enlarge the conference room .
he &apos;s the only lawyer i know
with an ego bigger than stern &apos;s .
we need this to go away quietly .
diane , have you ever known stern to do anything quietly ?
jeanette !
oh , it &apos;s so good to see you !
oh , baby .
how you doing ?
oh , you &apos;re as beautiful as ever , sweetheart .
hey , mike , arnie , how you doing ?
good to see you .
where the hell did we get that ?
that &apos;s the ugliest thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
but you haven &apos;t lived until you &apos;ve ridden horseback at midnight
across the timihani plateau .
oh , my god .
here .
who buys this stuff ?
my partners !
how are you , lovely ?
so , have you two bankrupted us yet ?
nope , you &apos;re doing that all on your own .
worry beads .
they were carved by a 70 @-@ year @-@ old balinese woman .
wear them ,
and you &apos;ll never lose in court .
thanks .
for you , my dear , a chinese perfume jar
said to contain the soul of a ming dynasty poet .
funny , i was looking for a ming poet at barneys .
jonas , this is ...
so , where is that jackass kreutzer ?
it &apos;s over , you know that .
i don &apos;t know anything .
his clients are going to mutiny .
stern &apos;s clients understand his proclivities .
it &apos;s a new economy , diane .
he &apos;s a managing partner , will .
it would take a vote of the general partnership to oust him .
which half are itching to do .
this dui is giving them cause .
have some respect .
mr. stern would like to speak to you two .
he fired you .
i &apos;ll bill you for an hour .
i &apos;m thinking of defending myself .
jonas , you are not going to defend yourself .
it &apos;s trumped up , you know that .
all that time i spent on the police review board ,
the chicago cops can &apos;t wait to knock me down a peg .
this is your second offense .
ah , worst @-@ case scenario , i lose my license for a year .
were you drinking , jonas ?
four scotch and sodas .
i was blitzed .
after the accident .
i crashed , i was shook up .
i walked into the westwood tavern
and downed four scotch and sodas .
oh , god .
the police are going to have a hard time discerning
the drinking i did before and the drinking i did after .
you &apos;re like an 18 @-@ year @-@ old .
is that her--
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s wife ,
the one that defended my daughter ?
yes .
i want her .
i want her as a front .
i &apos;ll defend myself through her .
this is a bad idea , jonas .
i want her to represent me .
the good wife s01e09
okay , this won &apos;t take long .
it &apos;s okay , mom , really .
no one &apos;s saying anything .
all right , well , then , just listen for my sake .
i want you to know what &apos;s true and what &apos;s not .
i don &apos;t know what your father told this woman ,
and i can &apos;t stop her from saying what she &apos;s saying ,
but i can always tell you the truth ,
and none of this is true .
thanks , mom .
what does dad say is true ?
i don &apos;t know .
he hasn &apos;t talked to you ?
he ...
he tried , but i haven &apos;t returned his call .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve ... i &apos;ve been angry .
but if it &apos;s untrue ...
it &apos;s still true that he slept with her .
yeah , but he already apologized for that .
it doesn &apos;t make it any less wrong .
okay , okay , it was my mistake .
i should have called him back and i will .
i will talk to your dad .
why don &apos;t we talk to him ,
ask him everything ?
what , like if he had a three @-@ way ?
it &apos;s not a three @-@ way , it &apos;s a threesome .
yeah , but you can still say &quot; three @-@ way . &quot;
no , you can &apos;t .
okay .
family meeting &apos;s over .
it &apos;s a plea is all .
you &apos;ll be fine , mrs. florrick .
i &apos;ll tell you exactly what to say .
could you tell me now ?
no .
the best arguments are spontaneous .
you know who told me that ?
justice powell--
the oral arguments for ricardo v. ohio .
i did my law review on ricardo .
i was brilliant on ricardo , wasn &apos;t i ?
you were .
yeah , it &apos;s harder doing great these days .
fewer opportunities .
i , uh ... chased you out
of the gossip columns , didn &apos;t i ?
yes . thank you .
well , the first time that a dui trumped a threesome .
your honor , matan brody
of the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
mr. stern , you may want in on this .
the people have added a charge
to the complaint , your honor .
aggravated battery to a police officer .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
you tacked that on for payback .
are you representing yourself here ,
mr. stern ?
your honor , this is payback .
it &apos;s clearly unorthodox , clear ...
selective prosecution .
selective prosecution in direct ...
contradiction of the 14th amendment .
of the 14th amendment right
guaranteeing equal protection .
you hit a cop , mr. stern .
you can &apos;t hit a cop .
speak to me ,
not my client , sir .
aggravated battery is a felony , your honor ,
carrying a prison term of two to five years .
as such , both this charge and the dui
now have to be heard in felony court .
that &apos;s too bad , mr. stern .
i was looking forward to this .
thank you , mrs. florrick .
i can take it from here .
is that the discovery packet ?
it is .
sir , if i &apos;m representing you ,
i think i should look at the discovery , too .
brenda , dinner at gibson &apos;s .
got it .
mr. stern , i heard you speak at georgetown once ,
and you said , &quot; even the best legal mind
requires the socratic method to keep itself sharp . &quot;
so ...
here i am .
so , you had a few drinks
at the party before the accident .
i had one drink , and they don &apos;t know that .
because , after the accident , you had a few more ?
that &apos;s perfectly legal .
you blew a .15 on the breathalyzer
at the police station .
that &apos;s almost twice the legal limit .
they &apos;re going to argue ...
they &apos;re going to argue that three drinks
wasn &apos;t enough to get me there .
and you can argue traumatic experience .
i was in an accident .
that increases the effect of alcohol dramatically .
and the battery against the officer ?
no mention of that in the police report .
now , these police cars--
they &apos;ve got their video cameras right on the dash .
those recordings are kept for up to six days .
subpoena those recordings before they can erase them .
and get that dispatch tape .
ten to one my name is on it .
yeah , they knew it was my car .
they couldn &apos;t wait to arrest me .
let the plotting begin .
you know , there &apos;s something
refreshingly honest about the borgias
murdering their enemies .
here , we just plot
no confidence votes .
here it is .
look .
thought we were studying martin luther king .
you were studying martin luther king .
see , there &apos;s your mother .
i don &apos;t get it .
it &apos;s a web site where you bet on stuff .
you know , celebrity stuff like , uh ,
you know , &quot; which disney star will die first ? &quot;
stuff like that .
so , they &apos;re betting on my mom ?
if she &apos;ll get a divorce .
that &apos;s ... awful .
so , what should i bet ?
you want to know if they &apos;re going to get a divorce ?
yeah . it &apos;s like having insider information .
it &apos;s like having somebody inside exxon .
see , after this whole threesome thing ,
betting is moving 75 % for divorce .
and i &apos;ve got 50 bucks , so ... ?
she &apos;s not going to divorce .
you &apos;re sure ?
i &apos;m sure .
so , did your dad really ask your mom for a threesome ?
no .
but they wouldn &apos;t tell you if he did , right ?
did you hear what she said on howard stern ?
who ?
your dad &apos;s hooker .
she said they had sex in your bed .
she did not .
yeah , she did .
that &apos;s what somebody in chemistry said .
so , just think about it .
right here .
this bed .
it &apos;s pretty cool .
it wasn &apos;t the same one .
i had a different bed .
what are you , like 14 ?
yeah .
well , i &apos;m 16 .
i &apos;m back , kids .
hello !
i ...
i got to help my grandma .
i &apos;m sorry .
let me give you something , zachary .
just , you know , in case your parents
are giving you any trouble , bothering you ,
and you want something--
some space , a car .
just , um ... play this .
what is it , rap ?
no , it &apos;s better .
it makes parents give you whatever you want .
you need a little rebellion in your life .
it &apos;s nice to meet you ,
mrs. florrick . i &apos;m rebecca .
zachary and i were just studying .
bye .
video for the dashboard camera .
thanks . good or bad ?
you should watch .
so ,
stern still treating you like a puppet ?
here &apos;s my script .
alicia , it &apos;s ...
who ?
amber madison .
she says she ... has a question for you .
take a message .
why is she phoning you ?
i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;s trying to cause a scene .
i don &apos;t know . for attention .
you want me to talk to her ?
talk to her ?
mm .
what would that entail ?
talk .
i &apos;m fine .
thank you .
contact me if that changes .
okay .
damn it . you need to calm down .
don &apos;t make me put the cuffs back on you .
i said let me go , damn it !
why did we subpoena this again ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
is this an accurate depiction of the events ,
officer sutton ?
yes , it is .
your honor , as you can see ,
the video is clearly relevant .
it may be relevant , but it &apos;s unnecessary
when they have the officer &apos;s testimony , and given ...
yes , ms. florrick ?
given the illinois state supreme court ...
the illinois court &apos;s ruling
in people v. harriman ,
we believe ...
harriman was one of your cases ,
wasn &apos;t it , mr. stern ?
yes . yes , your honor , it was .
that case dealt with video from an outside source .
this is video from the officer &apos;s dashboard .
we &apos;re arguing that the underlying principle is the same ,
your honor .
that might work
with the illinois supreme court , but not here .
very good .
we &apos;ll reconvene after lunch .
what was that ?
you &apos;re hesitating .
i don &apos;t have time to be hesitating .
you &apos;re interrupting .
maybe this was a mistake .
they should be out in a minute .
they &apos;re finishing up pretrial motions .
how many clients do you have ?
currently ?
two .
who pays you ?
a committee of interested advisors .
and how long are they paying you ?
it &apos;s month to month , but i &apos;d imagine until ...
actually , i &apos;m not sure how long they &apos;ll pay me .
&quot; until ... &quot; ?
it &apos;s not my business
to look into the future , mrs. florrick .
are there designs to put peter back in office ?
yes .
your husband is missed .
he was a very effective state &apos;s attorney ,
and people want him back .
it &apos;s insane
that i would hire a call girl to work on my campaign .
think about it . it &apos;s ...
she was talking about your kids at risk program .
yeah , well , and anyone who read the news
would know about that .
she &apos;s out there .
she &apos;s out there , and she can say whatever she wants ,
and there &apos;s nothing i can do to stop her ,
because the libel laws are against us .
she &apos;s phoning my work .
who ?
your ... prostitute
is calling my work .
i told the kids i &apos;d come here , peter ,
and talk to you , but i ...
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s right or wrong anymore .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s a lie or what &apos;s the truth .
i just ...
i can &apos;t take this .
hold on .
no .
i want it to stop .
this is your family .
i don &apos;t care about libel laws .
you make it stop . make her stop .
what are you saying ?
unless there &apos;s anything else ,
i rule that the police dashboard tape
be considered ...
your honor .
yes , mrs. florrick ?
i have one more thing .
no , you don &apos;t .
we move to disqualify the video
on the grounds that it was obtained
as the result of an illegal arrest .
your honor , what could possibly be illegal ...
mr. stern ,
is it your understanding that the officer ...
your honor ,
i am mr. stern &apos;s legal representative .
yes , ma &apos;am ,
but i believe mr. stern has a difference of opinion .
uh , mrs. florrick and i need five minutes ,
your honor .
no , we &apos;re fine .
officer sutton stated on his dashboard video ,
&quot; don &apos;t make me put the handcuffs back on you . &quot;
implying that he &apos;d been handcuffed previously .
did you , officer sutton ?
i &apos;d handcuffed him when i found him
in the bar because he was belligerent ,
as you see in the video .
but when i brought him outside ,
i took the cuffs off so i could perform a sobriety test .
was mr. stern armed ?
no .
did you fear for your life ?
no , but , i ...
then it was an arrest , your honor .
mr. stern was not free to go .
and officer sutton had no probable cause
the mere fact that it was an accident
does not mean a crime was committed .
so , everything that follows is tainted--
the sobriety tests , the video .
your honor , the video captures
the commission of a subsequent crime--
a battery of a police officer .
yeah , yeah , but it &apos;s exactly ...
mr. stern , please sit down .
except that it occurred during the sobriety tests .
and if the sobriety tests
are disqualified ,
the video must be disqualified .
motion granted .
the video is hereby excluded .
we &apos;re adjourned until tomorrow .
the best arguments really do sound spontaneous .
mr. stern ,
you cannot backseat drive your own defense .
you chose me to represent you .
if that is what you want , i &apos;m your lawyer .
you &apos;re my client .
let &apos;s go .
i , uh ...
i think you should take the kids to church more .
because ... ?
zach &apos;s listening to muslim music .
no , i &apos;m serious .
his girlfriend is muslim .
zach &apos;s girlfriend ?
yes .
zach has a girlfriend ?
yes .
they @-@ they were here yesterday
in his room , and they were playing that music .
and where were you ?
i was out getting groceries .
you have a girlfriend ?
no .
who was here yesterday ?
becca .
and becca isn &apos;t your girlfriend ?
uh , she &apos;s a friend who &apos;s a girl .
and you were in here working together ?
yeah .
she &apos;s helping me out with social studies .
she &apos;s a junior !
shut up ! no one asked you !
don &apos;t say &quot; shut up . &quot;
she was helping a freshman ?
i &apos;m ...
mom , she &apos;s nice .
you &apos;d like her .
oh , i &apos;m sure i would .
and she is welcome to study here anytime ,
but only when jackie is here ,
and only in the living room .
but the computer &apos;s in here .
wait , mom .
mom , what are you doing ?
here . carry this .
come on .
mom , this is ridiculous .
lots of light .
lots of room .
this is ...
mom , i want my privacy .
and you &apos;ll have that when you &apos;re 18 .
this is ...
nothing happened .
good .
would you like my desk lamp ?
you don &apos;t trust me .
zach , you &apos;re 14 years old .
you are a freshman in high school .
you had a junior in your room yesterday
with the door closed .
this is what is called parenting , that &apos;s all .
now , go get the rest of your stuff .
no .
you trusted dad .
now you think i &apos;m going to be the same .
zach , i love you .
i love you so much .
but the computer stays here .
how long did you stay at the cocktail party , mr. tolliver ?
about two hours .
i left around 10 : 00 p.m. ,
just after mr. stern left .
and can you tell us what you witnessed in that time ?
well , i saw mr. stern consume at least six drinks .
six ?
what kind of drinks ?
are we talking white wine spritzers here ?
scotch . neat .
tolliver is an investment banker ,
works for tolin &amp; howard .
have you ever had any fights with tolin &amp; howard ?
the problem is ,
one time or another ,
i &apos;ve pissed off practically everyone .
tolliver .
tolliver industries .
it &apos;s a family run business .
i sued them for civil rights violations . brenda !
get me the file on tolliver industries .
got it .
tibetan ginseng .
energy .
jonas ,
i checked on your case work .
the files weren &apos;t there .
what do you mean they weren &apos;t there ? why ?
a cary agos signed them out ,
on will gardner &apos;s authorization .
what the hell are you doing ?
sneaking around my files ?
looking for little slipups ?
it &apos;s an issue of firm liability , jonas .
somebody has to stay on top of these things .
oh , come on , will .
what ?
you certainly don &apos;t seem inclined to do it .
you know , you talk a good game about liability ,
but we both know this is about control .
jonas votes with me 90 % of the time .
you push him out ...
enough !
my god .
you call yourselves lawyers ?
i was winning cases
when you were in little league .
and you , my protege ?
the only reason i hired you
is because it looked good to have a woman in the office .
the both of you treat the practice of law
like it &apos;s used cars !
well , you try to get rid of me ,
it &apos;ll cost you every cent of your golden parachute ,
and that is after the lawsuit !
i will bankrupt this firm
before i let you
push me out .
i suppose you heard that tirade back there .
i imagine the people on lakeshore drive heard it , too .
we &apos;d better go in .
did you find anything on tolliver ?
yeah ... yes , tolliver industries .
right .
tolliver industries .
i sued them once . civil rights violations .
we should use that .
miss madison , i &apos;m daniel golden .
we , uh , spoke on the phone .
you look good , peter .
i always liked you in a suit .
we have issues that we have to deal with--
this book and your appearances .
yes , still a lot of pillow talk to talk about .
you phoned my wife .
that &apos;s always what it comes down to .
men and their wives .
i &apos;d like to talk to peter alone .
no .
you have an offer ?
stop writing the book ,
stop doing interviews ,
spreading stories about my client .
how much ?
you recognize this man ?
prior to your ... relationship with my client ,
you had a similar relationship with him .
peter ?
the fbi believe that he &apos;s responsible
for ordering the 24th ward murders
and three other slayings .
he owns a car dealership .
he &apos;s a businessman .
and i don &apos;t think
he will look kindly on your book
touching on his business .
my book doesn &apos;t touch on his business .
unfortunately , he doesn &apos;t know that .
he also doesn &apos;t know about certain personal things
that you mentioned to my client about him .
that was between us .
and it &apos;ll stay between you .
peter ...
you wouldn &apos;t .
you phone my wife .
you threaten my family .
you go on a talk show
humilate and slander my wife and children
to protect my family
you have no idea what i &apos;m capable of .
yeah ?
i need more help .
it &apos;s what i live for
donepezil .
that &apos;s the name of the medicine you &apos;re taking .
that &apos;s why you crashed .
you didn &apos;t drink at the party , and the roads weren &apos;t wet .
what are you talking about ?
i saw them , mr. stern .
they &apos;re not energy pills .
peter &apos;s father had dementia ,
not alzheimer &apos;s . his was vascular .
i know what it looks like .
the forgetfulness , the anger ,
mood swings .
i know how terrible ...
you know nothing .
jonas stern does not have dementia .
mr. stern , you &apos;re facing jail time .
i know that .
your condition is your defense .
this isn &apos;t a dui .
there is no condition !
i &apos;ll be damned if i &apos;m gonna have people think
that jonas stern is losing his mind !
there are three people who know what you know .
one is my doctor , the second one is me ,
and the third is now covered by attorney @-@ client privilege .
and as your client , i am ordering you
not to breathe a word of this .
not in my defense , not to anyone .
do you understand ?
do you understand ?
i understand .
stern gets into an accident , not because he &apos;s drunk ,
but because he &apos;s confused .
he doesn &apos;t want to admit it ,
so he goes and has four drinks
trying to make it look like he &apos;s covering up a dui .
so what does the cop do ?
sobriety tests .
which he fails , because now he &apos;s had a few ,
or he &apos;s shaken up .
or ...
what ?
the question isn &apos;t what did the cop do .
it &apos;s what didn &apos;t the cop do .
alicia ... where &apos;s stern ?
he &apos;s meeting me at court . why ?
we went through his casework .
everything was great until a year ago ,
and he started missing filing deadlines .
luckily , they weren &apos;t important ,
but we could be vulnerable here .
i &apos;m not asking you to divulge any privileged communique .
good .
but i need to know where his head &apos;s at .
unless that blowup was his final word on the subject .
look , all i want is for you to
look after his best interests
the firm &apos;s best interests .
the firm assigned me to represent him , will .
with all the confidentiality that entails ,
i can &apos;t ... say anymore .
you gave &apos; em to mom .
what ? get out of here !
the pictures of dad . you gave &apos; em to mom .
i didn &apos;t give anything to mom .
well , they &apos;re gone .
grandma .
why ... ?
how do you know that ?
zach , she goes through my room
when i &apos;m at school .
she throws away stuff she doesn &apos;t like , like
candy and clothes. she doesn &apos;t ever do it to you
&apos;cause you &apos;re the good boy .
i hate this .
yeah . when did you start paying attention ?
officer , what sobriety tests did you perform on mr. stern ?
objection . officer sutton has already testified in detail
about the tests he performed .
yes , your honor ,
but i &apos;m more interested in the one he didn &apos;t perform .
okay . let &apos;s see where this is going .
i see no record
of you performing a preliminary
breathalyzer test at the scene , officer .
i don &apos;t always do that , ma &apos;am .
these are reports from your last 37 duis .
you performed preliminary breathalyzers on ...
would you like to guess how many ?
thirty @-@ seven .
officer sutton .
your honor , it &apos;s perfectly innocent .
i voided the test results
because the machine was malfunctioning .
it showed mr. stern &apos;s blood alcohol level was .03,
but i could see he was drunk , he was stumbling around ...
so you neglected to put it in the police report ?
it wasn &apos;t accurate .
we got back to the station ... he blew a .15 .
an hour later ,
after the drinks from the bar fully kicked in ...
your honor ?
mr. brody , i &apos;m dismissing the dui .
and unless you want me to dismiss the battery
and levy sanctions ,
you &apos;d better come up with something fast .
misdemeanor assault .
six months probation .
ask her .
misdemeanor assault ? six months probation ?
time served ?
you must be pretty pleased with yourself .
you shouldn &apos;t be driving , mr. stern .
and unless you disclose your condition ,
you shouldn &apos;t be practicing law , either .
what are you ...
th ... the partners meeting isn &apos;t until 5 : 00 .
call it off .
i &apos;m not fighting you , diane .
i &apos;m leaving .
last thing i need is to waste time and energy here
fighting with people i love .
and i do .
that thing i said earlier ...
i &apos;m sorry .
it wasn &apos;t true .
i know .
i was the best lawyer you had at that firm .
yeah .
i have to admit ,
i never thought i &apos;d see the day jonas stern retired .
who said anything about retiring ?
i &apos;m leaving to start a new firm .
what ?
you know , last year ,
you billed over $ 50 million between gentech financials
and parthenon systems alone .
now , they &apos;re my clients ,
and i &apos;m taking them with me .
jonas , you take our clients ,
you forfeit your golden parachute .
my clients .
and that &apos;s not all .
i &apos;m gonna take a third of your business .
and then ...
i &apos;m coming back for the rest .
but , hey ,
it &apos;ll be fun .
we &apos;re not communicating here , jim .
i want it bigger .
i need 25,000 square feet at least .
all right . hey .
what are you doing ?
well , getting an office , staff , starting up .
we talked about this .
no , you talked about this .
and i &apos;m the only one to whom you will ever talk about this .
mr. stern , you have an ethical duty .
yes , to zealously represent my clients .
which i will do ,
with a team of young and hungry lawyers to back me up .
and i want you to be one of them .
oh , i ... i can &apos;t . i ...
thank you , but i @-@ i ... i can &apos;t .
loyalty to your friend will , hmm ?
well , i admire that .
just know that he will stab you
in the back if it benefits him .
i &apos;ll get that , brenda !
hello .
yeah , yeah , jim .
yeah , hold on . just hold on five seconds .
your husband was set up .
what ? !
forget the sex .
sex was just the barker &apos;s tease .
there are a lot of people who made a bad bet ,
and now they &apos;re covering their ass .
i @-@ i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t under ...
what does that mean ?
jim , yeah , i need it in the loop .
in the loop , yeah .
mr. stern ...
that &apos;s it , alicia .
i &apos;m not your deep throat on this .
your husband was set up ,
and they &apos;re not going to let him out of prison ever .
yeah .
no , you &apos;re thinking small . yeah .
find another well ,
will you ?
yeah .
no .
no , no , no , no , that won &apos;t do .
don &apos;t worry . i just ...
i wanted to tell you that i &apos;m sorry ?
i thought that your husband was in love with me .
he made me think that he was in love with me , and now i just ...
look , i wanted to warn you , okay ?
peter threatened me .
he said that if i didn &apos;t pull the book ,
and i didn &apos;t stop giving interviews ,
that he would hurt me .
look , would you listen ?
i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s capable of .
he doesn &apos;t even know that i &apos;m here .
i don &apos;t know what he would do ...
oh , go to hell !
go to hell !
you two deserve each other !

if he does anything , i &apos;ll print it .
i &apos;ll give an interview you wouldn &apos;t believe !
