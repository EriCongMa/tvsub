look , a while back , i had some medical issues--
headaches--and there was a geneticist that i reached out to .
i guess i just-- i think it &apos;s funny
how we &apos;ve been doing this for 6 months and we &apos;ve never met .
do you--do you think he knows about us ?
as far as i can tell he doesn &apos;t .
well , guess i &apos;ll talk to you next sunday .
bye . love you .
but if you &apos;ve got somebody new in your life to talk to ...
i &apos;d just like to know who she is .
she &apos;s gotta be one hell of a woman to keep up with you .
i think the stalker &apos;s gone .
the e @-@ mails have stopped .
what about the phone calls ?
no , i haven &apos;t gotten any .
no more heavy breathing on the machine ,
no more hang @-@ ups .
is this about ... phone booth girl ?
she wants to meet .
wait . you guys have never met ?
aren &apos;t you curious what she looks like ?
oh , it doesn &apos;t matter what she looks like .
i mean , she &apos;s already the most beautiful girl in the world to me .
hello .
maeve , it &apos;s me . listen , don &apos;t come to the restaurant .
what are you talking about ? i &apos;m outside .
go home .
look , i think your stalker &apos;s here .
have you the ring ?
place the ring on her finger .
on whose finger ?
i now pronounce you smart
and smarter .
let &apos;s get to it , you two .
get to what ?
kiss her , dummy .
hello .
hello . i have a collect call from ...
adam worth .
do you accept the charges ?
yes .
please deposit $ 2.00 for the first two minutes .
thank you .
hello , i &apos;m still here .
zug ... zwang .
i &apos;m sorry , can you please repeat that ?
zug ... zwang
i got here as quickly as i could .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i need to tell you something .
our correspondence started 10 months ago .
she wrote me a compliment
on my &quot; journal of behavioral psych &quot; article ,
and for 3 months , this is
how we communicated because she was scared .
scared of whom ?
she didn &apos;t know , only that he was dangerous .
horribly threatening phone calls ,
letters , e @-@ mails no matter where she moved .
it &apos;s why i never called her from the same phone booth twice .
you don &apos;t know what maeve looks like ?
no .
or where she works ?
no , i know she &apos;s a geneticist .
do you even know her last name ?
then i have to ask you , how do you know she &apos;s missing ?
because we always addressed our letters to pseudonyms .
and you &apos;re dr. joseph bell ?
the real life inspiration for sherlock holmes .
and that codename is how i know she &apos;s in trouble .
the voice on the phone identified himself as adam worth .
that was the american criminal that
arthur conan doyle based the character of moriarty on .
and what did he say to you ?
zug zwang .
it &apos;s a chess term ,
it describes the point in a game
when a player realizes he &apos;ll inevitably be checkmated .
he has to decide whether to resign
or to play through to the bitter end .
if you &apos;re right about this ,
then you &apos;re part of his victiology , too .
i know .
he thinks he &apos;ll get away with this ,
and he might .
i have a wealth of knowledge
i should be applying to this case .
behavioral patterns of violent stalkers .
tactical recovery strategies .
victim survival odds .
but right now i can &apos;t focus on anything
more than 4 seconds at a time .
which makes me the dumbest person in the room .
so ...
please help me .
help me find her .
we don &apos;t know if we have a case .
so we &apos;ll be working on personal time .
does anybody want to leave ?
good .
let &apos;s get to work .
deeply loved by someone gives you strength ,
while loving someone deeply gives you courage . &quot;
lao tsu .
based on maeve &apos;s description of the unsub in her letters ,
he seems like a classically possessive stalker .
one who craves validation and recognition .
&quot; what won &apos;t you see me ? &quot;
&quot; do you think you &apos;re better than me ? &quot;
this comes up again and again .
so does his suicidal ideation .
&quot; when i find you , i &apos;m going to kill you , then myself . &quot;
murder @-@ suicide is the ultimate
&quot; i love you &quot; to these guys .
when does the unsub start targeting maeve ?
maeve said it started out of the blue .
my guess is it was some sort of accidental when she acted some-
something she probably wasn &apos;t even aware of .
that &apos;s gonna make the unsub hard to find .
and maeve , too ,
until we know more about her .
i found her .
there are a lot many geneticists with that name ,
but dr. maeve donovan took a sabbatical
from mendel university 10 months ago .
that fits the timeline .
oh , she &apos;s a smart cookie . she burned her credit history ,
but her parents rent a little loft at the warehouse five days ago .
did the parents sell their house recently ?
no .
they might be helping her hide .
morgan , you and jj go to the loft .
blake and dave , go to the lab .
how clear is your head ?
not very clear--
i want to talk to her parents ,
but i want you to observe the interview .
reid .
i have a picture of her . do you want to see what she looks like ?
no .
so what are we , 10 miles outside of the city ?
her parents wanted to put some distance between her and her stalker ,
but they may have just made her an easier target .
fbi .
anybody home ?
it &apos;s clear .
this is definitely a crime scene .
it must have been a hell of fight .
smash ...
then hit .
there is no sign of forced entry .
maeve was on high alert .
exactly .
then how did this unsub get her to let her guard down ?
基因学院
here you go .
that &apos;s the personnel files of everyone in the lab .
not much there .
only 5 docs work here besides her .
and they &apos;re all men .
did any of them take a particular interest in her work ?
we all did .
her last project on cyclic adenosine monophosphate--
revolutionary stuff .
quite frankly ,
she made connections before i could even see them .
we know the feeling .
when was the last time that you spoke to maeve ?
6 days ago .
5 , after we got her situated in the loft .
why didn &apos;t she leave the dc area ?
i have health issues .
cancer .
and she wanted to stay close .
we were working on an oncology project together ,
and it was easier to share data if she was nearby .
you &apos;re a geneticist , too ?
retired .
i got out when i heard there was a new dr. donovan in town .
i know this is difficult for both of you ,
but is there anyone that you suspect ?
bobby .
the police ruled him out early on ,
but we never liked him .
who is bobby ?
her fiance .
and there were issues ?
bobby was her first serious relationship .
it was only till after they got engaged
she realized ...
he was a controlling bastard .
sorry . but it &apos;s true .
well , we need to talk to him .
fiance ?
reid , slow down .
she had a fiance , hotch .
let us handle it .
robert putnam .
fbi .
who ?
we &apos;re looking for robert putnam .
do you know where he is ?
he &apos;s in the back .
we need to talk to him .
and who are you ?
i &apos;m diane , his girlfriend .
hey , sweetheart , who is it ?
robert putnam , we &apos;d like to ...
i know you .
out .
wait , i need to talk to him , hotch .
why did he just recognize you ?
a couple of weeks ago , maeve and i were gonna meet .
he was at the restaurant .
i caught him looking at me
and something felt off about him .
and you &apos;re telling me this now ?
i didn &apos;t know who he was
and then a friend of his sat down ,
so i just assumed that i overreacted .
reid , if he &apos;s the unsub ,
you &apos;re a material witness .
you can &apos;t be in there . you know that .
stay here .
look , what &apos;s going on ?
where &apos;s maeve ?
we were hoping you knew .
why would i know ?
the same way that you knew that
she &apos;d be at that restaurant two weeks ago .
care to explain ?
when she went into hiding , she broke off the engagement .
i needed to see her ,
to make sure she was all right .
so i hired a private detective
and he found her through her parents .
when she made the reservation , i showed up , too .
why did you bring a friend ?
because there was a psychopath after her , that &apos;s why .
for someone madly in love ,
you sure moved on in a hurry .
maeve told me to .
and apparently she took her own advice .
did that make you mad ?
mad enough to hurt her ?
mad enough to stalk the man that she was meeting ?
there &apos;s something over there on that table ,
i &apos;m gonna go get .
don &apos;t shoot me .
he sent these to us .
the last month of our engagement .
the fact is ,
i was being stalked , too .
excuse me , doctor .
agent hotchner said you were down from upstairs ,
can , can you tell me what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;ll be in touch , ma &apos;am .
thank you .
all right , kid , talk to me .
i can tell you &apos;re adding something up in your head .
what is it ?
2,412 .
it &apos;s the number of hours we spent communicating ,
counting phone calls and letters .
that &apos;s about 100 days .
100.5 . what if that &apos;s all i get ?
well , it &apos;s not .
you can &apos;t say that .
yes , i can .
cause when we find her alive ,
and you finally get to lay your eyes on her ,
what &apos;s the first thing you &apos;re gonna say to her ?
a couple of months ago we were getting off the phone
and she said ,
&quot; bye . love you . &quot;
just like that .
&quot; bye . love you . &quot;
i know it was just a slip , but--
but she said it , reid .
she said it .
you didn &apos;t say it back to her , did you ?
i was waiting for when we finally met .
ok , i &apos;m sharing something i haven &apos;t told anyone .
every time we have a stalking case ,
i think rosanna arquette .
the whole arquette family to choose from
and you go with rosanna .
of course i go with rosanna , because rosanna arquette
was the inspiration for two seminal songs of my childhood .
&quot; rosanna , &quot; by toto ...
obviously .
... and &quot; in your eyes &quot; by peter gabriel ,
which gives one pause to think of the myriad of ways
a man can be obsessed by a woman ,
and what is she doing in bed
to inspire that kind of obsession , and can she teach us ?
because i want to know .
whoa .
he want detona that one .
jj , is that ...
i don &apos;t get it . i mean , i see the message ,
&quot; i &apos;m obliterating you , &quot;
but we already knew that .
no , see , it &apos;s not about the message .
it &apos;s about the medium , what he used to draw on her face .
spence ...
it &apos;s black eyeliner .
stalker &apos;s a woman .
that &apos;s why she masked her voice on the phone .
that &apos;s why maeve let her in to her loft .
she thought what we thought ,
that her stalker was a man .
but the question is , how could this unsub
have known about maeve and you ?
hotch ,
did you ever identify me to bobby putnam &apos;s girlfriend ?
what ?
did you say my name to her ?
did you call me dr. reid or agent reid ?
i never mentioned you at all . why ?
excuse me , doctor .
i think i know who the unsub is .
hey , honey .
you &apos;re still thinking about him , aren &apos;t you ?
yes .
are you sure that he was the one at the restaurant ?
yes .
he &apos;s an fbi agent .
interesting .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know i said i &apos;d let this go .
it &apos;s ok , part of me want the answer
just as much as you do .
is that new ?
do you like it ?
i , um , i &apos;ve never seen you dressed like that before .
no , you haven &apos;t , in fact .
i &apos;ve been waiting for months for you to notice me ,
notice that i &apos;m better , sexier , smarter than her .
it &apos;s not until i debase myself , then you notice .
what are you talking about ?
do you like this , bobby ?
because you have seen it before .
is that ...
diane ,
where did you get maeve &apos;s clothes ?
from her closet .
right after i bashed her head in .
she finally saw me ,
just like you see me now .
take a look , bobby .
take a good look .
what have we got ?
well , she knew we were close ,
so she came back for the fiance .
looks like they had a normal conversation ,
then she got violent . same thing that happened to maeve .
hey , dollface , what do you got ?
an identity that &apos;s pure vapor .
diane huntington is a fake name .
so is her address .
and all the phone conversations
she had with bobby were from a burner phone .
all right , keep digging and keep us posted .
we need to rethink the profile ,
reset everything that we know about maeve
through the prism of one woman stalking another .
you know ...
i couldn &apos;t understand it , bobby .
i really couldn &apos;t .
you could have had me .
instead you wanted that .
maeve ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
why are you doing this ?
why ?
let &apos;s just say
she took something from me that i can &apos;t get back .
so i decided if i can &apos;t have my life ,
i &apos;m gonna take hers .
what is she talking about ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know who she is .
after hunting her for ten months ,
after stealing her man ,
i had to stop and say , what is so freakin &apos; special about her ?
i couldn &apos;t see it .
until i saw ... him .
him who ?
the night you followed her , i followed you .
and i saw him .
i want what they have .
i want him .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re doing this ?
because of that stupid fbi agent ?
that stupid fbi agent is the reason why you &apos;re still alive .
you &apos;re gonna get her to tell me about him .
i don &apos;t want to hear what she has to say .
but that wasn &apos;t a request .
ok , we know numbers on female stalkers are minimal .
only 10 % of all cases are female .
all right , what tops the list of motivators ?
prior sexual intimacy .
erotomania ?
no . go the other direction .
think female scorned .
we slept together . you broke up with me .
now i &apos;ll do anything to get back with you .
reid , could that have fit maeve ?
could she have possibly been in a relationship with this woman ?
no . no .
spence , this morning you didn &apos;t know that she was engaged .
yeah , but the answer is no .
and what &apos;s the second @-@ most common motivation ?
celebrity stalking .
that fits better .
well , how ? she &apos;s not famous .
maeve &apos;s a star in her field , though .
that &apos;s a stretch .
celebrity stalkers are usually nonviolent .
you want to tell that to john lennon , rossi ?
what was it that mark david chapman said after he shot him ?
&quot; it was like all of my nobody @-@ ness
and all of his somebody @-@ ness collided . &quot;
maeve is somebody ,
and this bitch is nobody !
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t know where that came from .
um , i can &apos;t be very helpful right now . i should leave .
reid . reid , yes , you can .
you have 100.5 days of communication with the girl
and your brain lets you recall every word verbatim .
she probably revealed details about the unsub to you
and neither of you even noticed .
there &apos;s too much of it
and i can &apos;t sort through it with any clarity .
and pick one of us , someone will go through with you .
blake .
ok .
let &apos;s get out of here .
you wanna talk here ?
yep .
you play ?
yeah , i know my way around a board ,
but ... that &apos;s not the point .
i want you to focus here and not on my questions .
so , let &apos;s try this out .
when you think of maeve ,
what &apos;s the first thing that comes to mind ?
thomas merton .
what about him ?
in her letters ,
she will always sign up with a quote
from one of her favorite philosophers .
camus , voltaire , plato .
when we had the near miss at the restaurant a couple of weeks ago ,
she left me a book
with a quote by thomas merton written inside .
he said &quot; love is our true destiny .
&quot; we do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone .
we find it with another . &quot;
then ...
thomas merton was her way of saying good @-@ bye .
yeah .
so ,
let &apos;s talk about this . hmm ?
because this i didn &apos;t expect .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . let me catch you up .
i found these letters in maeve &apos;s loft ,
and i guess she didn &apos;t get around to sending this one ,
and ... it &apos;s really good .
&quot; about the blindfold today ,
i can &apos;t wait to use it . &quot;
blindfold .
you know , i thought i knew your fiancee .
but i guess she &apos;s kinkier than we thought .
it &apos;s not what you think .
&quot; it &apos;s not what you think &quot; is girl code
for &quot; it &apos;s exactly what you think . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not what you think .
did you sleep with him ?
i never even saw him .
why risk your life to meet him ?
i &apos;ve been alone for so long , i just wanted to be with somebody .
you could have been with bobby .
it was different with him .
different how ?
he was just ...
he was just what , maeve ?
when we would talk , i would ...
it was effortless ?
that is so interesting .
really .
so if you two had this deep connection
where you &apos;re talking in your own code ,
why do you think the unsub would attack the fiance first ?
i don &apos;t know , access , maybe .
no , something links the two of you in the unsub &apos;s mind .
she wants to destroy anyone
maeve had a romantic relationship with ?
it could be jealousy or revenge .
maybe maeve got in the way of one of her old relationships ?
it &apos;s just not her .
you see , when men cheat ,
it &apos;s below the belt .
but when women cheat ,
it &apos;s above the neck .
no . we were broken up . i never cheated on you .
but you didn &apos;t love me .
not like that .
now you know how i felt ,
to be ignored , cast aside .
it &apos;s not fun , is it ?
just let us go , d
what else do you want ?
did you guys ever compare lists ?
the different people you dated ?
i remembered 4th , 3 : 40 p.m. ,
i asked her if she dated a lot growing up .
no way .
do you know how many friday nights i had
where it was just me and a microscope ?
i thought that was just me .
oh , come on .
girls must have adored you at high school .
i was 12 , it &apos;s kind of confusing
once i got the note from this girl i had a crash on .
she thought i was cute
but would only meet me if i wore a blindfold .
i did . and she took my shirt off .
that &apos;s when i heard the laughter .
most of the senior class was in there .
oh , it sounds awful .
maeve thought so , too .
when we finally meet ,
i &apos;m gonna make blindfolds fun again .
you had him eating out of the palm of your hand every sunday
and he never even saw your face .
i have to admit that takes skill .
that takes finesse .
how &apos;d you do it ?
hello !
doctor , are you in there ?
seriously ?
ok . fine .
just tell her .
there was a moment when you had him
and you knew you had him .
what was it ?
euclidean geometry .
there &apos;s this thing called the penrose triangle .
he told me a story
about how he tried to build one when he was 8 .
this better get sexy quick . i &apos;m getting bored .
you can &apos;t build it .
it &apos;s an impossible physical structure .
it only exists in conceptual geometry .
but i said ,
every penrose triangle has its thorns .
and he laughed .
it &apos;s just a stupid pun .
but he laughed .
that &apos;s it .
what about co @-@ workers ?
maeve was the only female doctor at mendel university .
what was it like for her ?
she once spoke about the awkwardness
of being the only woman in the department .
when men are jealous of your success in the lab ,
they want it for themselves .
but women want it so you can &apos;t have it .
sometimes this institution turns us against each other .
what if the unsub wasn &apos;t a doctor .
what if she was a grad student
maybe working on her ph.d. there .
yeah , but how could maeve miss her ?
each of the doctors has their own project .
each project has it &apos;s own team of research assistants .
they don &apos;t mingle , but they &apos;d be the first applicants
for an open position .
and if maeve rejected her thesis ,
the unsub would take it personally .
and that rejection has become an obsession to possess .
i want to see what he sees .
he sees you as his equal .
that &apos;s it , isn &apos;t it ?
i just--i have to let him see that i &apos;m on your level .
great . you figured it out .
now , please , will you let us go ?
no .
no .
i have to show her that i can take everything that she has .
then she &apos;s going to remember me .
you , however , are superfluous .
i &apos;m sorry , bobby .
you &apos;ve always been the runner @-@ up in this pageant .
wait . wait .
please . please ...
don &apos;t hurt him .
please !
don &apos;t hurt him .
her name is diane turner .
she worked as a research assistant at mendel university
while maeve was there .
did she apply a ph.d. there ?
yeah . she was one of a bunch of internal applicants
that got rejected .
looks like she left not long after maeve .
correct . she now works at a local junior college .
dave , you , reid , and jj take the residence .
blake and morgan , take the campus .
what was her doctoral thesis about ?
it says here , &quot; spontaneous cellular death in suicide patients . &quot;
there &apos;s a suicidal ideation again .
except cells don &apos;t behave that way .
why is she so obsessed with it ?
you still don &apos;t remember who i am , do you ?
no .
i &apos;ve tried and tried to remember and i can &apos;t .
but whatever it is i did to you , i &apos;m sorry .
forgive me . tell me what it is you want me to say to you
and i will say it .
i just want this to be over .
i can do that .
you just have to do something for me first .
get up there .
why ?
do it .
why don &apos;t you just kill me ?
i want to see if you &apos;ll jump .
it &apos;s my theory that when you make a decision to give up
that the cells in your body start to die .
can you feel it ?
your whole body beginning to decay .
it makes it easier to want to kill yourself .
go . go ahead , prove my theory .
i remember you .
clear !
clear .
is this a shrine to her dead parents ?
her parents committed suicide .
that explains her obsession .
guys , she is watching us .
garcia .
what you got , mama grizzly ?
there &apos;s a web cam in here . can you hack the feed ?
i read your thesis , didn &apos;t i ?
you turned me down because you couldn &apos;t handle the competition .
no . i turned you down because your testing was flawed .
it was not flawed !
your sample was biased ,
you included your parents .
the science was sound .
you didn &apos;t even read the whole thing , did you ?
no , i did . i did .
i did read it .
and do you know what i thought after i was finished ?
i thought , whoever wrote this has suffer a tragedy .
and i felt sorry for your loss .
but you don &apos;t get a ph.d.
just because something bad happened to you .
no .
you just couldn &apos;t see it ?
you can &apos;t see that i &apos;m a genius !
genius ? do you know what genius is ?
i know that i am one .
maybe .
maybe you do have that gift .
maybe your theory could have had merit .
but we don &apos;t know .
because genius isn &apos;t just one good idea
or one successful experiment , diane .
genius is work .
thousands of hours of work .
she &apos;s spoofing the ip address
and she &apos;s encrypted the feed .
in other words , like layman &apos;s terms , this is gonna take a while .
what are you doing ?
making a deal .
that &apos;s why you didn &apos;t make it .
you didn &apos;t do the work .
but you could .
yeah , you could do the work .
i &apos;ll help you .
get on the ledge .
now !
no . if you &apos;re gonna kill me , you kill me .
but i am not jumping .
because i want to live long enough to see spencer arrest you .
spencer has a different idea .
hello .
it &apos;s me .
are you ok ?
she killed bobby .
are you ok ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve got a concussion and some bruising , but i &apos;m ok .
can i talk to her ?
no . she &apos;s listening .
good .
but i want to meet her . i need to see her face to face .
she has a message she wants me to give you .
what is it ?
the message is , she left you a present .
and if you want to find it , it &apos;s easy as pie .
what does that mean ? i don &apos;t understand what that means .
neither do i.
spencer , it &apos;s a trap .
if you come here , she &apos;s gonna kill you !
i need a map of d.c.
this is diane turner &apos;s apartment .
this is the nearest cell tower her phone call to me pinged off of ,
which means this is the circle that maeve was telling me about .
what circle ?
it was a clue in diane &apos;s message .
finding her would be as easy as pie .
only she wasn &apos;t referring to the food ,
she was referring to ...
pi .
why would diane give you a clue ?
maeve made a similar pun once .
now diane wants me to see her the same way ,
but brilliant , the smartest girl in the room .
all right , assuming that diane has a secondary location ,
where in the circle would she hold maeve ?
she &apos;d need a building that would allow for privacy and control ,
a closed garage for prisoner transfer ...
if she &apos;s copying maeve &apos;s life ,
it might be someplace close to maeve &apos;s apartment .
there &apos;s nothing in diane &apos;s name .
well , what about maeve &apos;s name , or even bobby &apos;s ?
maybe she forged his signature .
nope .
what about diane &apos;s parents ?
yes . yes . diane rented a
loft right next to maeve &apos;s in her parents &apos; name .
reid .
i can &apos;t let you be a part of this takedown .
we don &apos;t have a choice . if i don &apos;t go in there , maeve is dead .
and if you do , you &apos;re dead .
hotch , we &apos;ve known from the beginning
she &apos;s on a murder @-@ suicide mission ,
but we never stopped to ask why she &apos;s on that mission .
we know now that it &apos;s because she wants recognition ,
the type of recognition she thinks maeve gets ,
and i can give her that .
how ?
i &apos;m gonna tell her that i love her .
hang on . i got a box on the steps .
that &apos;s the gift .
what is that , a blindfold ?
take your gun and vest off .
now come in alone .
reid .
put it on .
can i take the blindfold off ?
no .
hello .
i was hoping you &apos;d figure out my riddle .
i mean , i knew you would .
the fun was just how fast you &apos;d do it .
oh , there &apos;s some brains , too .
it took me a long time .
to be honest , i was distracted by your thesis .
you read my thesis ?
i did . you know , i think your writing
puts you on the same plane as jonas salk .

i &apos;ve already sent it to the nih .
flattery is not gonna get you out of this .
i know what &apos;s waiting for me outside .
i &apos;ve arranged for your freedom .
the federal government doesn &apos;t make deals with people like me .
not true . nazi scientists were recruited for the manhattan project .
mafia bosses are regularly put into witness protection .
if what you have is valuable enough ,
the federal government will work with you .
and what you have is very valuable .
and what do i have , doctor ?
you have a brain that doesn &apos;t play by normal societal rules .
and i know that all your life
the people you care about the most keep leaving .
there &apos;s a part of you that thinks it &apos;s because of that brain .
well , i &apos;m here because i &apos;m not going to leave you .
i &apos;m here because ...
i just ... hope that i can get the chance .
chance of what ?
to be with you .
me for her . that was the deal , right ?
you &apos;re choosing me over her ?
diane , how could it be anyone else ?

this time say it to her face .
i don &apos;t love you .
sorry .
i understand .
i don &apos;t need her anymore .
kill her and she won &apos;t have
to live with the fact that you &apos;re smarter .
let her live with her arrogance and see them .
i just want her to see one more thing .

you lied !
i didn &apos;t .
diane , i offered you a deal and you can still take it .
me for her . let me take her place .
you would do that ?
yes .
you would kill yourself for her ?
yes .
