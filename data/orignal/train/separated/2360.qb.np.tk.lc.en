you must be elena .
how do we look exactly alike ?
because you &apos;re a petrova doppelganger .
you &apos;re the key to breaking the curse .
the sun and the moon curse ?
klaus is the real deal .
from the first generation of vampires .
the oldest vampire in the history of time
is coming after me ?
elijah . one of the originals .
he &apos;s a legend .
i &apos;m prepared to offer you a deal .
what kind of a deal ?
you and i shall drop out
and i shall make certain your friends remain unharmed .
and then what ?
then i kill him .
take me far , far away .
where would you like to go ?
these must be the other jonathon gilbert journals .
i come bearing gifts . this is how you kill an original .
that ring isobel gave you .
that &apos;s mine . i &apos;m gonna want that back .
did he ever tell you what happened to his wife ?
what are you saying ?
why don &apos;t you ask rick ?
how will you kill klaus ?
after the sacrifice .
after the sacrifice ?
elena has to die .
you knew that you weren &apos;t going to survive this ?
if it comes down to the people that i love
getting killed and me , i know what my choice is going to be .
you &apos;re being a martyr .
that &apos;s not heroic . it &apos;s tragic .
with the dying embers of the fire
at fell &apos;s church , the scourge of the vampires had passed .
and though war raged all around us ,
our town was safe from the demons of the night ...
or so we thought .
for the monsters we drove to their fiery deaths
had beget new monsters .
did you hear that ?
stay here .
no , thomas .
it &apos;s all right , dear , the vampires are all dead .
yes , honoria ,
they burned in the church . we &apos;re safe now .
please , jonathon . i &apos;m worried .
very well . i shall go , too .
i can prove there are no vampires .
see .
thomas ?
thomas ?
thomas !
no , stay inside ! get back in the house !
no !
i knew i was about to die .
you can not run from a vampire .
i saw the vampire who killed me .
i recognized him .
stefan salvatore .
what &apos;s going on ?
well , i showered . i shaved .
had breakfast . very relaxed .
that makes one of us .
i did hear one piece of good news though .
tyler lockwood ran away from home last night .
how do you know ?
well , i heard it from sheriff forbes ,
who heard it from a very distraught carol lockwood ,
thus , ending our werewolf chapter ,
bringing us to ...
killing elijah .
exactly .
well , it &apos;s not going to be easy . he &apos;s crafty .
well , i &apos;ve got a crafty little dagger .
he &apos;s an original . we don &apos;t know what all that encompasses .
oh , trust me , stefan .
i &apos;m gonna dot all my t &apos;s . i don &apos;t want any surprises .
wow , damon , tell me you &apos;re actually gonna be careful for once .
yes , stefan , i &apos;ve become you .
how tragic for both of us .
got to run . i &apos;ve a murder to plan .
busy day .
the old fell property actually starts just beyond that fence .
ah , the fells . one of the &quot; founding families . &quot;
why do you say it like that ?
my research showed me that this area was actually settled
almost two full centuries earlier .
it was a migration of townsfolk from the northeast ,
um , it was salem , to be precise .
massachusetts ? as in the witch trials ?
which means the ever lauded founding families ...
they didn &apos;t actually found anything .
well , i bet it was the men who made a big deal
about being founders back in 1860 .
men are very territorial .
yes , they are .
elijah , this is my friend , alaric saltzman .
yeah , i got your message about walking elijah here
through the old property lines .
i thought i would tag along .
you know being a history buff and all .
where to next ?
i &apos;m pretty curious about the freed slave property owners .
some say , you know , the descendents of the slaves
are the true keepers of american history .
well , i only brought the surveys .
i got the list in the car just give me a sec .
alaric saltzman .
so you &apos;re one of those people
on elena &apos;s list of loved ones to protect .
so is jenna .
you don &apos;t have to be jealous .
i don &apos;t really pursue younger women .
it &apos;s a joke , ric , lighten up .
right .
hey , whatcha doin &apos; ?
thinking about last night .
yeah , yeah . me , too .
it was a tough spell .
i could feel it draining me . i need practice .
yeah , well , uh , maybe , i don &apos;t know .
maybe you should come over tonight .
we can practice . get stronger .
yeah , sure . thanks .
ah , incoming .
you want to tell me what the hell happened yesterday ?
sorry ?
don &apos;t play dumb . you both were here and ...
and ?
and that &apos;s all i remember .
one minute i &apos;m playing pool
and the next i &apos;m waking up in a bathroom stall .
sorry , luka , but everything seemed normal yesterday .
i brought you a coffee and we played pool .
see , i think you &apos;re lying .
and i think you need to back off .
are you still mad ?
yeah , i &apos;m still mad .
we had a difference of opinion , stefan ,
we &apos;re not always gonna agree on everything .
elena , you &apos;ve agreed to sacrifice yourself to klaus .
to say that we have a difference of opinion
is the understatement of the century .
you would know .
what does jonathan gilbert have to say ?
a lot .
it &apos;s insane the things he wrote in his journal
that he kept from the founding families .
stuff that nobody knows . stuff that ...
you never told me .
we were , uh ...
we were angry at the founding families
for what they did to katherine .
we wanted revenge .
i didn &apos;t know about jonathan gilbert &apos;s ring yet .
i didn &apos;t know that he would ... that he would survive .
he describes you as a monster .
that &apos;s what i was .
i want you to know the truth ...
but i want you to hear it from me .
in the weeks after i became a vampire ,
i relished in it .
i took it to the darkest place i could .
who wants to die next ?
me , i &apos;m next .
me , you promised me .
what about you ?
you know if you don &apos;t pick up the tempo ,
you &apos;re going to lose your head . snap . snap .
company , brother ?
i brought enough to share .
are you mad bringing them here
when the entire town is hunting us ?
damon , if you &apos;re worried about the founding families ,
please don &apos;t be .
they &apos;re all dead or about to be .
leave this place . never think of it again .
same for you . leave this place .
never think of it again .
damon , don &apos;t be like this .
i &apos;m just having some fun .
staying alive is more fun , stefan .
we have to be more careful than this .
more clever . like katherine was .
look what that got her .
i &apos;m done here .
with you .
i &apos;m leaving town .
you hate me . i know . i know .
an eternity of misery and on and on .
but you don &apos;t have to leave town .
damon , i &apos;ll do better . i promise .
no , you will get us killed .
i &apos;d rather leave you to do that to yourself .
i wasn &apos;t myself then .
i was full of guilt . what i did to my father ,
to my brother . i had to turn it off .
it was the only way i could survive .
it sounds like you were damon .
i was worse .
other than the lecture on the history of mystic falls ,
did you get anything out of elijah ?
no , it was boring .
of course , jenna thinks he &apos;s charming .
you sounded jealous . sound a bit jealous ?
kinda do .
maybe we shouldn &apos;t talk about this here .
andie , she &apos;s been compelled
not to divulge my secrets . haven &apos;t you ?
mmm . my lips are sealed .
this is too weird .
i just need the right opportunity .
ah , there &apos;s jenna with her new boyfriend .
so i hear you two had quite a meeting
of historical minds today .
yeah , i guess you could say that .
well , as much as i &apos;d love to continue this ,
i &apos;ve got papers to grade .
no , you know what ? we should continue this .
let &apos;s have a dinner party .
ooh , my girl . full of good ideas .
i &apos;ll be happy to host .
say tonight . maybe ?
it &apos;s good for me . jenna ?
i don &apos;t know if tonight works--
i &apos;m free .
it &apos;d be a pleasure .
great .
drink up .
good girl .
i &apos;ve come bearing gifts .
i didn &apos;t have time to properly shop ,
but i did get a couple of things . hmm ?
wow , that blood did the trick .
you &apos;re almost pretty again .
what is it you want , damon ?
guess who &apos;s back in town ?
your old friend , john gilbert .
really . why ?
says he loves his daughter .
wants to protect her from elijah and big , bad klaus .
touching .
yeah , right .
he told me this old wives tale
about how to kill an original .
and you want to know if it &apos;s true .
if it was , i wouldn &apos;t tell you .
now , why not ? i mean , you want elijah and klaus
dead as much as i do .
klaus , yes . elijah , no .
he &apos;s compelled me to stay in here .
if he dies , i &apos;m stuck forever .
sucks for you .
forget it , damon .
killing elijah would be a suicide mission .
you can &apos;t do it .
can so .
can &apos;t .
even with a dagger and a little white oak ash ?
no . damon , if you kill elijah ,
then i &apos;m stuck in here forever .
you &apos;re really scared .
just get me out of here first
and then i &apos;ll help you .
i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll help you kill eljah
or--or protect elena . whatever you want .
i get you out of here and your ass
is sipping klaus @-@ free margaritas
on some unknown island somewhere . no way .
that &apos;s not true . i &apos;ll stay .
damon , please just don &apos;t do it .
well , thank you , you &apos;ve told me everything i need to know .
i &apos;ve told you nothing .
you have . you have indeed confirmed
that it is possible to kill an original ,
which i will do tonight .
guess who &apos;s coming to dinner ?
for weeks i kept spiraling .
i was completely driven by the desire for blood .
hunt , prey , kill .
that was all i knew .
how come no one caught on to what you were doing ?
mmm . there was a war going on .
the thing about wartime .
endless , anonymous blood supply .
what kind of an idiot are you ?
alexia branson , as she was known back then .
lexi ? your best friend lexi ?
that &apos;s how you met her ?
what was she even doing in mystic falls ?
she had heard it was a good place for vampires .
you know , had no idea that they &apos;d all been massacred .
needed a place to crash , so i brought her home with me .
i &apos;d say it isn &apos;t necessary to take me in ,
but you did try to eat me , and well , with dawn coming ,
beggars can &apos;t be choosers .
or should they be ?
i , um ... i meant to dispose of those .
my god , you &apos;re a ripper .
a what ?
there are good parts of being a vampire
and there are bad parts .
you &apos;re the bad parts .
well ... we &apos;re going to have to change that .
you ok ?
talking about her brings up things i &apos;d rather forget .
like damon killing her ?
so what &apos;s going on with you and alaric ?
i feel like there &apos;s some tension .
i don &apos;t know .
i really like him .
it &apos;s more than like
and i want it to work ,
but i can &apos;t help but feel that he &apos;s hiding
something from me . and then i &apos;ve got john
whispering things in my ear about him .
like what ?
things i don &apos;t want to believe .
things i don &apos;t believe ,
not if they &apos;re coming from john &apos;s mouth .
oh . well , there you go , then .
trust is the key to any relationship .
i mean , i am so grateful that damon tells me everything .
this is a bad idea .
there &apos;s no such thing as a bad idea .
just poorly executed awesome ones . here .
no . i don &apos;t like the idea of elijah being
in the same house with jenna .
jenna &apos;s perfectly safe .
besides , it &apos;s just a fact @-@ finding mission .
it &apos;s totally harmless .
just a fact @-@ finding mission .
yeah .
listen , no sneak attacks . no surprise plans .
nothing that &apos;s gonna put jenna in harm &apos;s way . ok ?
scout &apos;s honor .
hey , jenna needs help with the wine .
thanks .
yeah .
ok .
what &apos;s that ?
dessert .
elijah &apos;s stronger than me .
faster than me .
it &apos;s all about the element of surprise .
ah , it &apos;s too bad . i like him . he &apos;s very old @-@ school . classy .
which is why you should encourage the gentlemen
to take their after dinner drinks in here
while you do coffee in in the kitchen with the girls .
hmm . that is a little too sexist for me .
stop talking .
who invited him ?
john . surprise . leave .
when jenna told me she was coming to a dinner party
for elijah , i decided i
couldn &apos;t miss out on all the fun and games .
there are not going to be any games tonight ,
john . it &apos;s just a friendly dinner party .
what he said .
thanks .
that thing weighs a ton .
i &apos;m starving . you guys have any ... food ?
oh , god . heh ! this is a date .
no , no it &apos;s not like a date , date .
more of a hey , i kissed you ,
and i thought you liked it , um ... hang thing .
jeremy , i need to make sure elena is cool with this
before anything else happens .
i didn &apos;t realize my sister had approval over who i &apos;m with .
she &apos;s my best friend . i tell her everything .
and this whole hang thing might freak her out .
all right , all right , so we &apos;ll , um ...
we &apos;ll hang out , eat some food ,
work on some spells .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
but you did ... you did like it , right ?
yeah . i liked it .
good evening .
thank you for coming . please , come in .
just one moment .
can i just say that if you have anything less
than honorable intentions about how this evening is going
to proceed , i suggest you reconsider .
no , nothing , nothing dishonorable .
just getting to know you .
well , that &apos;s good . because , you know ,
although elena and i have this deal ,
if you so much as make a move to cross me ,
i &apos;ll kill you and i &apos;ll kill everyone in this house . are we clear ?
crystal .
jenna . wonderful to see you again .
how are you ?
nice to see you .
you look incredible .
thank you .
i hate to break it to you , damon ,
but according to elijah ,
your family is so not a founder of this town .
do tell .
well , as i mentioned to jenna earlier ,
a faction of settlers migrated from salem
after the witch trials in the 1690s .
over the next hundred years they developed this community
where they could feel safe from persecution .
because they were witches .
yeah , but there &apos;s no tangible proof
there were witches in salem .
andie &apos;s a journalist . big on facts .
well , the lore says that there was this wave of anti @-@ witch hysteria .
it broke out in the neighboring settlement ,
so these witches were rounded up .
they were tied to stakes in a field together
and , uh , burned .
some say you could hear the screams from miles around us .
they were consumed by the fire . could you pass the ...
i wouldn &apos;t repeat this to the historical society .
it &apos;s starting to sound a little like a ghost story to me .
so why do you want to know
the location of these alleged massacres ?
you know ... a healthy historian &apos;s curiosity , of course .
of course .
jonathan gilbert got crazier and crazier .
i guess that &apos;s what happens
when you spend your life obsessed with vampires .
he researched the originals .
you &apos;re kidding .
later in life . look .
pages and pages of questions and scribbles .
what &apos;s that ?
&quot; the wood from one tree and one tree alone , &quot;
&quot; an ancient white oak would bring death to an original vampire . &quot;
&quot; when the tree burned , all hope was thought lost . &quot;
he was trying to figure out how to kill an original .
&quot; but the ash from the tree was saved , &quot;
&quot; and witches forged a dagger to which the ash could be bonded . &quot;
&quot; this alchemic bond provides the necessary poison . &quot;
elena .
i wonder if this is true .
i mean , do you think this dagger actually exists ?
i know it does ...
because john gave it to damon .
john gave damon the weapon that &apos;s supposed to kill elijah ?
this one ?
&quot; it must be brandished by humans alone , &quot;
&quot; for it will bring death to all demons who wield it . &quot;
john &apos;s trying to get damon killed .
does anyone care for some cognac ?
i have a bottle i &apos;ve been saving for ages .
none for me thanks . 9 bottles of wine is my limit .
why is your phone off ? call me .
what &apos;s going on , atefan ?
damon is planning on killing elijah .
tonight .
the gentlemen should take their drinks in the study .
i have to say the food was almost as wonderful as the company .
i like you .
here you are , gentleman , make yourself useful . hmm ?
here , here . put me to work .
um , i got it .
hey , jenna , are you-- are you ok ?
yeah , fine , ric .
i suspect this is my fault .
what did you do now ?
i merely mentioned you haven &apos;t been completely honest
with her about your dead wife .
you son of bitch .
i think i &apos;ve been very clear with you , ric .
i want my ring back .
hello . slow down . slow down .
stefan ?
so , let me guess . in addition to the moonstone ,
the doppelganger , the lion ,
the witch and the wardrobe ,
you need to find this witch burial ground .
because i feel as though we &apos;ve grown so close , damon ,
i &apos;ll tell you yes .
do you know where it is ?
maybe .
tell me why it &apos;s so important .
we &apos;re not that close .
it &apos;s quite a collection you have here .
it &apos;s a funny thing about books .
before they existed , people actually had memories .
gentlemen , we forgot about dessert .
elijah ?
miss star .
sorry , guys , dessert is taking longer than i thought .
i usually just unwrap food .
so ... i know this is a social thing ,
but i ... i would really love to ask you some more questions
about the work that you &apos;re doing here .
i &apos;d love to answer .
great . oh , that &apos;s so great .
ric , would you do me a favor and grab the notebook out of my bag ?
elijah , did john tell you
he &apos;s elena &apos;s uncle / father ?
yes , i &apos;m well aware of that .
of course , she hates him , so there &apos;s absolutely no need
to keep him on the endangered species list .
ric , it &apos;s in the front pocket .
on the--you know what ? excuse me , guys . sorry .
what i &apos;d like to know , elijah ,
is how do you intend on killing klaus ?
gentlemen , there &apos;s a few things
we should probably get clear right now .
i allow you to live solely to keep an eye on elena .
i allow elena to remain in her house
living her life with her friends as she does
as a courtesy . if you become a liability ,
i &apos;ll take her away from you and you &apos;ll never see her again .
ok .
my first question is when you got here to mystic ...
now , get rid of him before jenna comes back with dessert .
all right .
elena , we need to talk about this .
what good is talking if you and damon are just gonna lie to me ?
if you don &apos;t like my decisions , that &apos;s fine .
there &apos;s nothing i can do about that ,
but if you ever go behind my back again , i &apos;ll--
you &apos;re gonna what ? hmm ? what are you gonna do , elena ?
it &apos;s my life .
yeah , exactly .
it &apos;s your life and i &apos;m gonna do everything i can
to make sure that you live it .
then what ? this--this-- this trip through the past .
you being honest . was there any truth to that
or were you just distracting me ?
i was telling you about a time when i thought everything was lost .
when i had given up because that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re doing right now .
that is not what--
yes , it is . even if you don &apos;t want to admit it .
you are giving up . and lexi ,
she wouldn &apos;t let me give up .
i &apos;m not gonna let you .
all of these men are dead or dying .
what does that make you feel ?
nothing . i feel nothing .
because you shut out the part of you that was human .
the part that lets you feel .
is that not the point ?
well , there is a better way . you simply have to want it .
is it better ?
not at first . you can &apos;t choose what you feel .
you have to let it all back in .
the pain and the look in their eyes
when you took their life .
the cries of their loved ones .
why would i want to do that ? hmm ?
because once you can hurt , you can love .
love , stefan .
that &apos;s the point .
everything is intensified when you &apos;re a vampire .
when we hurt , we really hurt .
but when we love ...
lexi showed me that there was another way .
and from that day forward , i started fighting for it .
for my own survival .
that &apos;s all i want you to do .
i just want you to fight for it .
now , you said there wasn &apos;t going to be any violence .
says the guy that did all the killing .
hey , i took the shot because i saw an opening ,
not because i planned to do this with jenna in the house .
now , you can &apos;t lie to me like that .
hey , i am your friend , damon .
and you don &apos;t have any friends .
so , no more lying .
elijah &apos;s dead .
alaric did it .
originals believed in truth and honor .
it was forbidden for a vampire to kill another vampire .
so , the dagger would take both lives .
and as long as the dagger stays in place ,
the original , for all intents and purposes , is dead .
what happened ?
i need you to find elena .
now .
now that is cool . how does it work ?
it &apos;s called channeling .
siphoning power from something--
another witch ... the moon , an elephant .
so , technically , you could channel me .
what ?
well , i &apos;m an element , sort of .
i mean , isn &apos;t--isn &apos;t the human body mostly water ?
you &apos;re right .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s what happens .
what the hell are you doing here ?
jeremy !
what did my son tell you ?
what did he tell you ?
he told me about your daughter .
i know klaus has her
and i want to help you get her back .
but i want us to work together .
please .
this is for your own good .
no ! no .
no !
if any harm comes to my son because of what you did ,
you will answer to me .
you ok ?
it &apos;s ok .
what happened ?
he took my powers .
he &apos;s here .
you have to go . i need to talk to him alone .
elena .
stefan i &apos;m ok , he can &apos;t come in the house .
you know , i might not be able to enter this house .
but i &apos;m a very patient man .
i &apos;ll wait you out .
they shouldn &apos;t have done what they did .
the deal is off .
i &apos;m renegotiating .
you have nothing left to negotiate with .
i &apos;d like to see you lure klaus into mystic falls ,
after the doppelganger bleeds to death .
stefan won &apos;t let you die .
no , he won &apos;t .
he &apos;ll feed me his blood to heal me ,
and then i &apos;ll kill myself and become a vampire ,
just like katherine did .
so unless you want that to happen again ,
promise me the same as before--promise me ...
you won &apos;t harm anyone that i love .
even if they &apos;ve harmed you .
i &apos;m sorry , elena .
i &apos;m going to have to call your bluff .
no !
yes . yes , you can have your deal .
let me heal you .
give me your word !
i give you my word .
little tip . don &apos;t pull the dagger out .
where did john disappear to ?
maybe the same place the rest of the dinner party ran off to .
look , jenna , i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m so sorry tonight was--
what happened to isobel ?
you know , john should have never brought that up .
that &apos;s not an answer .
he &apos;s just trying to stir up trouble .
that &apos;s not an answer , either .
i can &apos;t talk about this , jenna .
i keep thinking that maybe it &apos;s me .
maybe i &apos;m reading into things .
i should trust you .
that &apos;s what a relationship is about , right ?
but then i think that maybe john is right
and maybe you &apos;re not being honest with me .
so ... are you being honest ?
right , ok .
well , that was an answer .
well , that was awkward .
you know , i can clear all this stuff up about isobel tomorrow ,
if you want .
or not .
you want it ?
take it .
it &apos;s yours .
and after what you did to damon ...
you &apos;re gonna need it more than me .
what do we have here ?
a little moonstone bar of soap .
i &apos;ll hold on to this .
so , that &apos;s it .
i mean , as long as we keep the dagger in there ,
then he stays dead .
pretty much .
ok , then ... good night .
you know , you guys want me to fight , fine , i &apos;ll fight .
but if we &apos;re gonna do this ,
you can &apos;t keep anything from me anymore .
from this moment on , we &apos;re doing it my way .
that seems fair .
ok .
ok .
seems like she &apos;s had a change of attitude .
how did you get through to her ?
i told her a little story
about when i was making the wrong decisions
and somebody showed me there was a better way .
lexi ?
yeah .
you remember her ?
going somewhere ?
you must be the vampire i hear my brother complaining about .
that would be me .
and you must be the brother who hates him .
we are at irreparable odds .
you know the hate you &apos;re feeling towards stefan ?
towards everyone ?
you think you have it under control but you don &apos;t .
it will get the best of you .
help him .
he needs it .
i &apos;ll help him .
andie ?
i thought you left .
hello , damon .
hey , do you have a robe ?
how did you get out ?
i knew that if i begged you not to kill elijah ,
that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;d do .
little known fact--originals can compel vampires .
but as soon as they die , the compulsion wears off .
and you knew ?
and i &apos;m still here .
i didn &apos;t run .
i meant what i said to him , damon .
i &apos;m going to help you .
