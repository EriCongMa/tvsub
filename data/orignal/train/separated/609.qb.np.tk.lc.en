jeff , you haven &apos;t even looked at the new course catalog .
i &apos;m like a kid in a candy store .
well , the candy has lost its appeal now that i work at the store .
you might say becoming a teacher here gave me diabetes .
i was just saying that .
are you always thirsty and fatigued
and you have blurry vision and your cuts heal slower ?
those are actual diabetes symptoms .
that &apos;s what the doctor said .
so , is he treating it ?
i asked him the same thing .
what did he say ?
he said , make an appointment
through his office during business hours .
this is his home , his children sleep here .
you know doctors .
oh , my gosh , you guys .
there &apos;s a class called basic grifting .
should we all learn how to be grifters together ?
wait , what do grifters do again ?
i got this .
i &apos;ll tell you for five bucks .
no .
you better sign me up .
me too .
i &apos;ve always wanted to learn more about grifting
ever since i saw 1990 &apos;s , the grifters ,
featuring john cusack , anjelica huston ,
and almost no grifting .
you guys , don &apos;t take a grifting class .
you &apos;re going to get grifted .
even more so than by that oceanography class ,
only none of you will even get a goldfish ,
then you &apos;re gonna come crying back to me .
why you ?
because , lets face it ,
i &apos;m the closest thing that greendale has
to an experienced grifter .
oh , this is one of those things
where jeff gets jealous of something dumb .
jeff &apos;s jealous of a grifter .
because he wishes he was still a grifter
that &apos;s something even i could mock , and i live in an rv .
i &apos;m judging you , and my dinner table folds down from a wall .
i say we all take the grifting class together ,
have a great time , and rub it in jeff &apos;s face !
who &apos;s in , and can you cover me ?
i &apos;ll pay you back .
i &apos;ll get it from your parents .
i &apos;ll pay you back .
at which point i &apos;ll pay back your parents .
which will be never .
i &apos;ll get a high five from your parents .
all right , each student should bring a briefcase .
i don &apos;t have a briefcase .
we &apos;re gonna grift with briefcases ?
basic my ass , that &apos;s advanced .
mm @-@ hm .
i have a few extra briefcases .
shocker .
are they regulation ?
we each need a regulation grifting briefcase .
it &apos;s a grift .
what &apos;s a regulation briefcase ?
i don &apos;t know .
but they &apos;re provided for only $ 150 .
you &apos;re being grifted .
shut up , jeff .
you &apos;re such a negative person .
what do you contribute to this group besides negativity ?
guys , watch this , can i borrow $ 150 ?
no .
see !
now who &apos;s gonna come with me and show this guy what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;ll pay you back .
i &apos;ll get it from your parents .
tell them i spit on their wealth and thank you .
第六季 第九集
good morning .
my name is professor roger desalvo ,
for the time being .
for i use many a pseudonym ,
such as jeff goulash , philip switch ,
or baz ravish .
for i am a grifter
and this is grifting 101 .
now which one of you thinks i did that on purpose ?
exactly , you think you &apos;ve seen me fail .
you think you &apos;ve spotted a weakness .
let me tell you something ,
with a flick of a wrist , i could show you a fool
one minute , or longer .
i see you &apos;ve got your briefcases .
excellent . hold them aloft .
pass them to each other .
now pass them back .
do it at speed .
quicker !
pass them like hell .
pass them like your sister &apos;s dying ,
and continue that for about 40 minutes .
wait , 40 minutes ?
what &apos;s your name , my love ?
annie edison .
that sounds like a real name ,
not the name of a grifter and therefore , not a teacher .
what ?
my name is slick pockets tucker .
no , it &apos;s not .
that &apos;s correct . i was just wondering
what the next lesson will be .
the next lesson will be passing two briefcases .
you need to master the art of passing one ,
and then you can purchase another briefcase .
what ?
you talk too much .
keep passing .
it &apos;s a very funny book .
oh no , grifters .
i better watch my french fries unless , counterfeit ?
where &apos;d you learn to do that ?
we didn &apos;t learn anything .
that class is ...
a rip off ?
hm , what &apos;s another word for that ?
all he did was throw his hat and make us pass briefcases .
and , he kept trying to sell us stuff .
briefcase swapping talcum for grifters palm ,
briefcase hinge oil for silence switcheroos ,
and something called extra believable socks .
those are actually half off , i kind of feel like i grifted him .
so in a sense , what happened is
you took a class about grifting .
aaaaaannnnnd
jeff , you really need us to say it ?
you were
eh , whoa , whoa , yeah
i need you to say it .
let me just get settled .
okay go .
you were right .
yeah .
well , you live and you learn , guys .
well , you live anyway .
so now , will you please help us ?
help you ?
we want revenge .
we wanna grift him back .
you wanna grift a grifter ?
that &apos;s as dumb as taking his class .
just cut your losses .
but , jeff .
i begged you not to go down this path , and you made fun of me .
you pointed in my face and laughed .
we &apos;re sorry we hurt your feelings .
my feelings are fine .
i &apos;m just very lazy , and you gave me an excuse to do nothing .
i &apos;m not just gonna throw that away .
you don &apos;t want to take this guy down ?
he &apos;s even lazier than you .
doesn &apos;t your species consider that a challenge ?
shouldn &apos;t you be on some kind of reverse pissing contest
to determine who &apos;s laziest ?
wait , is that where you suck it back up in your ... ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ve only ever done it the other way .
you mean peeing ?
no , i mean in the back .
he hasn &apos;t done anything to me .
in fact , he sounds like a pretty good guy .
i bet we &apos;d get along .
good show .
good show .
what show ?
i haven &apos;t seen that show .
all right . all the best .
and , you are ?
well , i was the guy with a full bottle of scotch
and a high tolerance for foreigners .
how robust .
i &apos;d imagine that you &apos;re jeff winger .
turns out we &apos;re going to be office buddies .
hello there , sir .
my name is roger desalvo .
or is it ?
you see , i happen to be in the ...
grifting 101 .
yes , i &apos;ve heard about you .
that would be your desk .
if you need a mnemonic device ,
it &apos;s the one without someone else &apos;s stuff all over it .
well played , very well played .
i gotta say .
i admire your style .
grifting people by selling them grifting lessons ?
it &apos;s genius , but i called it .
i never said my class was a grift .
i don &apos;t worry about me , i &apos;m one of you .
was , anyway .
do tell .
well , i worked at one of the top law firms
in the city as a lawyer , but guess what .
i &apos;m not a lawyer .
well , i think you &apos;re talking about lying .
grifting happens to be an art form .
the art of lying .
let &apos;s not get high @-@ handed .
grifting is lying .
okay . so , like a string is a sweater ?
like , paint is the sistine chapel ?
sure , grifting includes lying ,
but only a liar would call grifting lying .
and , only a delusional hobo would glorify stealing .
really ? did you say something that wasn &apos;t true there ?
maybe we should phone the museum .
i was on your side . you &apos;re an ass .
well , you &apos;re a craftless , artless thug .
and , i &apos;m god &apos;s paintbrush .
no , i am god , which pretty much makes me better than you .
you know what ?
let &apos;s agree to disagree .
it &apos;s not important .
oh , okay .
so , you can lie .
yeah , you liar . yeah .
i wanna speak to you , you son of a bitch .
what ?
i love you .
i do too .
good .
why are you guys still doing that ?
well , it was homework ,
and we &apos;re getting better , right ?
or , the friction has gradually melted
the handle to fit into our palms .
there &apos;s nothing to get better at .
the class is a grift .
the next person who says grift is gonna grift !
my god , now it &apos;s replacing other words .
all right , i &apos;m in .
let &apos;s grift the son of a bitch .
yay !
why are you cheering ?
he could be saying anything .
grift ! grift !
grift ! grift !
grift ! grift !
good work , i can &apos;t remember your name .
likewise , no idea what your name is .
great job .
all right .
i say you &apos;re pretty close to swapping the briefcases loaded with
actual fake money such as this .
this isn &apos;t real money , it &apos;s just cut up newspaper .
but it weighs the same , costs five dollars a piece .
you &apos;ll be using ten .
telegram for elroy patashnik .
i &apos;m patashnik .
telegram , sir .
oh , my god .
my aunt baba died on vacation while in africa .
but she left me a million dollars ,
but the african government wants to seize the funds .
class dismissed .
not you .
are you out of your mind ?
what ?
the african telegram .
the jim belushi of grift ?
are you trying to grift me ?
i &apos;ll cut you in for fourteen grand .
get out .
out .
one more thing .
nice try twice .
twice ?
the fake grift within the grift ,
or the double bean , if you like .
i &apos;m gonna mention a name
and however you react , i &apos;ll know the truth .
jeff winger .
that &apos;s the one !
jeff winger ? what with the , who ?
that &apos;s the one .
out you go .
say hi to him .
by the way , jeff winger ,
nice try thrice .
hey , how was grifting class ?
did you teach some advanced
grifting techniques only you could understand ?
the brown betty ?
the texas oil baby ?
the reverse jim gaffigan ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t teach the african telegram .
since i &apos;m not a hack .
and also , since the internet .
okay . you got me .
game over . let &apos;s end this competition .
cheers to that .
sir , you .
that guy left his lottery ticket on the table .
that was the telegram man .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
i mean what telegram ?
exactly . what telegram ?
because the internet , you know ?
that place that you obviously went to
to type in the world grifting .
look , i &apos;m gonna grift you .
i &apos;m gonna grift your ass .
or is that the grift ?
none of it is a grift !
it &apos;s all nonsense !
okay , how many times have i told you people ,
the faculty lounge is not a bar ?
all right , pack it up people .
come on , you don &apos;t have to go teach a class
but you can &apos;t stay here .
look , truce .
okay ?
promise no more grifting and promise ,
if this is worth a million ,
we &apos;ll split it .
you &apos;re an idiot .
or maybe i &apos;m a genius .
no , i can answer that .
you &apos;re definitely an idiot .
can an idiot walk backwards like this and not hit anything ?
maybe .
or , maybe not .
what ?
what are you doing here ?
this guy is a grifter .
professor of grifting .
he charges $ 400 , you get two brief cases
and your ex boyfriend becomes an obsessive .
i didn &apos;t know you and winger were lovers .
if he wanted my respect , he should have opened with that .
are you trying to be disarming ?
are you grifting me out of my arms ?
i did nothing to that man .
he called himself a grifter .
i just simply corrected him .
yeah , because the truth is so important to the both of you .
so what &apos;s it gonna cost to make you go away ?
well ?
he took the bait .
yes .
yes .
wait , i thought we didn &apos;t want him to take the bait ?
no , no , we &apos;re saying the same thing .
he didn &apos;t take the bait we didn &apos;t want taken .
the african telegram ?
yeah , which was offered as fake bait
and taken as such , ie , not taken .
because that made him feel in control .
and by avoiding all visible bait ,
he placed himself on the invisible hook
of assuming we &apos;re planning to grift him .
oh , i like it .
yeah .
but we are . so we knows the truth .
isn &apos;t that like the one thing you &apos;re not supposed to know
when you &apos;re being grifted ?
he can know a plan all he wants .
but the plan he knows won &apos;t be our plan .
okay .
because our plan is
impossible to know ?
because ...
oh my god , jeff is making this up as we go .
shh , knock it off .
what do you want from me ?
we wanted you to help us do a grift .
i &apos;m working on it .
improvisationally ?
he definitely had in the plan in the sting .
if anybody wants to watch it ,
it &apos;s important you know , it knocks out half a calendar day .
look , do you guys remember when we hugged
and jumped up and down in the cafeteria ?
yeah .
obviously .
well , having been together virtually non @-@ stop ever since ,
at what point do you think i slipped off with pen and paper
and planned an entire grift ,
then withheld it from you ?
i guess at any of the several dozen points
when a normal person would say ,
by the way , i have no plan .
in the sting , they do withhold stuff from each other .
or from the audience , but i think for effect .
also , be warned , 20 % of the movie is hand drawn .
abed , why don &apos;t you marry the sting ?
okay , just so you know ,
if i do and we have half sting children ,
when they ask me how to grift ,
i &apos;m gonna tell them to watch their mother ,
not listen to you !
yeah !
shut up , okay !
you guys , you &apos;re , you &apos;re always picking on me , all right ?
and you &apos;ve really been hammering me lately .
all i had was the idea that ...
look , look , i , i need this .
i need to be better than this guy .
so let me think .
abed .
yeah ?
did you bring your laptop ?
yes , right here .
what do you wanna do with it ?
watch the sting .
骗中骗
it &apos;s over .
whatever .
who got shot ?
what &apos;s going on ?
was sting even in it ?
that movie was terrible .
you slept the whole time .
yeah , that &apos;s worse .
the dialogue seeped into my dreams .
my whole brain is long and quiet .
so how did they grift him ?
well , they basically made a fake building
and hired 1,000 people to cooperate in perfect secrecy .
should we just do that ?
we could watch another grifter movie .
there &apos;s more activity in matchstick men .
oh , like what ?
at one point they build a fake hospital .
so much construction !
oh , god , it &apos;s so late .
you guys are gonna bail on me , aren &apos;t you ?
i think we have to , jeff .
we &apos;ve tried everything we can .
maybe over the weekend
i can make a fake building ,
but all the briefcases and the swapping , and the sting ?
i &apos;m not cut out for it .
i &apos;m starting to think that
real grifts only really happen in the movies ,
and even in the movies they barely make sense .
look , i &apos;m old .
the sting is terrible .
grifting is stupid .
the writing &apos;s on the wall .
so that &apos;s it ?
there &apos;s no shame in this , jeff .
oh , i don &apos;t know about that .
well , this is a scene to behold .
holed in the closet watching the sting like gypsies .
roger , we surrender .
you were right .
i &apos;m no grifter .
no , i was wrong .
if you remember , i called you a thug .
thugs fight .
you &apos;re more , nope ,
i can &apos;t think of a metaphor pathetic enough to suit you ,
jeff winger ,
though i am reminded of something oscar wilde once said
when he compared sheep to wolves .
screw it .
you hit me with a woman &apos;s hand .
you midwestern floozy .
i lived in new york .
yeah , right , he &apos;s grifting us .
grift blood . someone taste it .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s karo syrup and food dye .
i mean i would , but my diabetes .
19 , 20 , 21 .
are you counting the amount of money or the number of stacks ?
i have to start over .
i &apos;ll do it , move .
but i want to go on record as being
disgusted by this transaction .
got it . disgusted .
i , i &apos;m sorry love , but would you rather we took this to court ?
no , no , no , no , no .
we appreciate you keeping this between us
and i do want to remind you
that we offer a lot of classes
and many of them are cash only .
me , take a class here ?
talk about a rip @-@ off .
talk about a ribbing .
what the hell am i doing ?
you know , so far , frankie &apos;s disgusted and , that &apos;s it .
seems like a waste of a record .
so sorry guys . this is all my fault .
don &apos;t be . i &apos;m the one who got in a pissing match .
with a jerk .
you &apos;re a jerk .
you &apos;re a jerk .
you &apos;re a jerk .
you &apos;re all jerks .
and this whole school can suck a big one .
and you can put that in your record .
i &apos;m sorry , guys , i &apos;m bound by my station .
speaking on that topic , britta ,
this is all your fault and you &apos;re expelled .
what , what ?
no , dean .
let , let , let , let , let me handle this .
no , you can &apos;t do that .
britta &apos;s the heart of this group .
she started it as a , as a , as a , as a , as a ,
as a fake biology group so that she could have sex with troy .
no .
that &apos;s exactly it .
oh , okay . don &apos;t let me handle it .
no . you can &apos;t expel britta , she &apos;s been here six years .
three more , and she &apos;ll have her two @-@ year degree .
britta keeps me grounded in reality .
you can &apos;t expel her with four week @-@ episodes
left in the season @-@ mester . see , it &apos;s starting .
it &apos;s okay , guys . it &apos;s okay .
all right . 50,000 .
whoop , i &apos;ll just put this in here .
give it to me .
yep .
don &apos;t help me , anyone .
turn me around .
see you later .
the plan was to meet later .
so , what &apos;s it gonna cost to make you go away ?
you &apos;re know there &apos;s a way we could end this very quickly
and make a bit of money .
i don &apos;t like it , but keep talking .
yes . that was the plan .
and , your plan was probably to never show up .
clever girl .
don &apos;t trust anyone .
hang on . did you have to hit me , for real ?
have to ? no .
now that you &apos;re expelled ,
you might consider a career in grifting .
you &apos;re quite good at it .
i don &apos;t know . how does one go through life like that ?
well , follow me , and i &apos;ll show you .
oh , shut up .
i only agreed to any of this to get you away from greendale
and out of jeff &apos;s hair .
he &apos;s an idiot , but i hate watching him
spin out trying to beat you .
you sentimental fool .
later at the motel .
the motel .
some say i &apos;m a lucky grifter .
some say i &apos;m the king .
they call me the lucky grifter .
they call me the king of england .
i am the king .
no .
what the hell ?
oh , shut up .
the only reason i agreed to any of this
was to get you away from greendale
and out of jeff &apos;s hair .
what the ?
you two , come back here !
briefcases .
coming right through .
identical briefcases .
what ? why more briefcases ?
this is pointless !
i already know she &apos;s got my briefcase !
briefcase parade !
who the hell are you ?
you get back here .
you get back here with my money .
get back here !
oh , roger .
they stole my money .
what ?
what ?
those briefcases contain my money .
they stole $ 50,000 from me .
50 grand , huh ?
you guys know what he &apos;s talking about ?
i don &apos;t think so . these are our briefcases .
what is grifting class . he sells these supplies .
150 bucks .
really ? okay .
we are still rolling .
we got pretty good at it , too .
check it out .
ow , sorry .
sorry . okay .
roger , why were you walking around with $ 50,000 ?
are you mental ?
hey , whoa pal .
that usage may fly in the uk , not in the states .
i have a mentally challenged cousin .
sister .
pics . i wanna see pics .
okay , you do .
you know very well that this school
paid me $ 50,000 in cash for these injuries .
well , you seem to be in pretty good shape .
no , oh , my god ! look at the two of you !
yeah , he &apos;s the reason i became a cop .
you know , a lot of bullies out there .
there are a million witnesses to this .
hey , everyone .
hey guys , just hanging out in the cafeteria ?
hi profess- oh , what happened to your face ?
this is ridiculous .
she &apos;s beautiful . you could be twins .
so , the statement i &apos;m hearing here is
you &apos;re a grifting professor .
yeah .
you &apos;re teaching these people how to grift
but you &apos;re saying they grifted you .
no , you id . i &apos;m not saying that .
they didn &apos;t grift me .
what they do is not grifting .
they wouldn &apos;t even understand what the word meant .
i think we need to take what roger &apos;s saying more seriously .
because it sounds like
he was either the victim of crass ,
artless thuggery .
correct .
in which case , there really is $ 50,000 floating around
that he was given for clearly fake injuries ,
and that he therefore now owes the school .
what ?
or professor desalvo was targeted
by a group of people
he vastly underestimated , in which case the money was given
and then taken back and nobody owes anybody anything .
all he would have to do is admit .
i was grifted .
grift , grift , grift , grift , grift , grift , grift , grift .
why are you even here ?
who called you ?
nobody .
i take macrame after work , they know that .
sorry you got grifted ,
let me know if you want to press charges and
if you could think of what those would be .
professor desalvo , under the circumstances
i &apos;m sure you agree it doesn &apos;t makes sense for you
to keep teaching this subject here .
yeah , i mean , we kinda know everything there is to know .
you should probably refund all their money
and we should all go get some hot dogs .
hot dogs .
hot dogs .
hot dogs . hot dogs . hot dogs .
hot dogs . hot dogs . hot dogs .
hot dogs . hot dogs . hot dogs . hot dogs . hot dogs .
we were all in it the whole time ?
you weren &apos;t .
because i can &apos;t be trusted .
hot dogs . hot dogs . hot dogs .
hot dogs . hot dogs . hot dogs . hot dogs .
telegram for mr winger .
hey , ridley .
so , i returned the telegram man outfit to the dean .
thank you so much .
i know how crazy this week &apos;s been .
you really didn &apos;t have to do this .
are you kidding ? i owe you .
whatever you need . just say the word .
all right . i could use your help moving a mattress this weekend .
okay , cool .
is that okay ?
let me know .
my name is ryan ridley .
three years ago my life was saved by a stranger at my gym .
i felt like i owed him my in life .
apparently he agreed .
now he has me do things , and i keep hoping and praying
that one day i &apos;ll do enough for him to call us even .
until then , i &apos;m just a guy from his gym .
did you get any of that ?
