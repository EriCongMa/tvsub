daddy .
when i was a child ,
my father was framed for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
daddy .
amanda .
daniel , this is amanda clarke .
she &apos;s back in town after all this time .
strange , right ?
the only reason that nolan invested with your father
is because tyler &apos;s blackmailing him .
the graysons are incredibly powerful , your honour .
i was intimidated into helping them frame david clarke .
i &apos;ve hired a lawyer , daniel .
it might get ugly .
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
whatever you want in this divorce is yours .
you do not want to play games with me .
defense lawyers use the term &quot; duress &quot;
to describe the use of force ,
coercion , or psychological pressure
exerted on a client in the commission of a crime .
when duress is applied to the emotionally unstable ,
the result can be as violent as it is unpredictable .
hey , babe . i know how you like your morning coffee .
you know how i like everything .
i missed you last night .
yeah , me , too .
any update on tyler ?
no . he never came home last night .
how &apos;s your mom holding up ?
oh , she &apos;s all right , considering the circumstances .
she &apos;s past the initial shock of the divorce papers
and now she &apos;s redirecting her energies
into planning my birthday party .
and that &apos;s a bad thing ?
for my 21st , she hired the cast of cirque du soleil to perform .
subtlety is not her strong suit when it comes to parties .
well , why don &apos;t we do something low @-@ key ?
maybe a clambake on the beach ?
sounds perfect .
i &apos;ll call my mom , tell her it was my idea .
mm . and i &apos;ll make sure she feels included .
hello ?
daniel .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m on my way to sit down
with your mother and our lawyers ,
and i was hoping that you and i could have a chat first .
you know what ? i was just about to leave .
call me later ?
okay .
mr. grayson .
what do you want me to say , dad ?
nothing .
i &apos;m just asking you to listen .
i &apos;ve got enough people hating me , son .
i don &apos;t want to add you to the list .
you and charlotte ,
you &apos;re everything to me .
i &apos;m not asking you to take sides against your mother
or even agree with my actions .
just don &apos;t cut me out , not completely .
okay , what about tyler ?
clearly , he was just using me to get to you ,
but you still hired him .
admittedly , it was-- it was a mistake .
i wasn &apos;t thinking clearly .
consider him gone .
well , then consider me back on board .
i &apos;ll see you at the office .
mom .
daniel .
you left without saying good @-@ bye this morning .
i wanted to let you rest .
i &apos;m sure it was another sleepless night .
well , actually ,
it was very comforting , having you here last night .
listen , i just spoke to dad .
as far as he &apos;s concerned , we &apos;ve patched things up .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , i &apos;m positioned to get you
whatever information you need to help you with your divorce .
thank you , darling .
tyler ever come home ?
no , but i agree ,
he &apos;s overstayed his welcome .
i &apos;m going to ask him to move out when he returns .
have you given any thought
about how you want to celebrate your birthday ?
yeah , i wanted to keep it simple ,
so emily &apos;s gonna throw a clambake on the beach ,
just family and one or two friends .
whatever you want , darling .
you know i &apos;m gonna have to invite dad .
well , it &apos;s all for the greater good .
i &apos;ll check in with you in a bit .
morning , victoria .
i thought we could spend some time going over concepts
for daniel &apos;s birthday celebration .
clambake .
i beg your pardon ?
daniel wants a clambake .
please call emily and see if you can lend her
your severely overqualified hand .
of course .
i googled &quot; friendship &quot; on the interwebs .
apparently , when you have a fight with a friend ...
you &apos;re supposed to apologize .
word of advice-- leave the joke cracking to me .
you suck at it .
and the apologizing , how am i doing there ?
i &apos;m no expert ,
but i think an apology involves the words &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; ?
look ...
i actively taught myself not to trust people .
what happened with you and tyler caught me off guard ,
but i do believe you never set out to sabotage me .
no , on the contrary .
all i ever set out to do was to help you
and your dad .
as much as i hate to admit it ,
you were right about tyler .
i &apos;m a terrible judge of character .
we all have our weaknesses .
tyler is just really good at exploiting them .
yeah , now he &apos;s got all the ammo he needs .
he stole my whale cam .
with all the video files in it ?
including everything that happened to lydia ,
and now he &apos;s got all the physical evidence he needs
to extort conrad--
or , if we play it right ,
all the rope necessary to hang himself .
believe it or not , this could be good news .
blackmail ...
it isn &apos;t just for breakfast anymore .
speaking of which ...
how &apos;s amanda ?
hopefully not long for this part of the world .
i made sure victoria found out she &apos;s in town .
devious .
first things first .
we need to find out where tyler is .
covered .
that red dot
is the gps from his cell .
so where is he ?
the southfork inn .
i &apos;m guessing the grayson &apos;s block of business suites .
will you let me know where to find it
when he &apos;s back on the air ?
you still haven &apos;t said you &apos;re sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
first on the docket is the triplex on 5th avenue .
conrad can have it .
why ? you just spent half a million redecorating it .
the chalet in aspen .
i despise the cold .
the house on fisher island .
uh , rather than wasting more time here ,
let me make this simple .
my client is willing to give up her rights to
every piece of property except grayson manor .
because your client knows that this property &apos;s worth more
than all the other properties combined .
and as for the art , all she &apos;s asking for is the renoir ,
the pollock , and the henry moores .
and the kandinsky .
well , what about the de kooning
i bought you for your 40th ,
the one you said you couldn &apos;t live without ?
well , like so many things , it hasn &apos;t aged well .
against my advice , ms. grayson
is being more than fair here .
in addition to her share of the finances ,
all she &apos;s asking for is one house ,
a few pieces of art ,
and , of course , charlotte .
mr. grayson is seeking sole custody .
that &apos;s out of the question .
charlotte came to live with me of her own volition .
i &apos;m just trying to honor that choice .
the only thing you &apos;ve ever honored is your own ego .
you &apos;ve been on a campaign
to alienate her from me for years .
charlotte needed no provocation .
victoria was recently caught on camera
confessing that she &apos;d wished our daughter had never been born .
you &apos;re reprehensible .
why don &apos;t we table this for now ?
i concur .
i took the liberty of glancing through the prenup
that victoria signed back in &apos; 86 .
we &apos;ll be using this as the basis
for any financial discussions going forward .
actually barbara , we won &apos;t .
see , victoria was pregnant when she signed the prenup ,
which by any court &apos;s definition would qualify as duress .
therefore , she &apos;s entitled to a full 50 %
of all assets accrued during the marriage .
duress ?
marrying me was the best thing
that ever happened to that woman .
we &apos;ll see you in mediation .
how the hell did you get in here ?
tricks of the trade , my friend .
listen , i gave some more thought
to the terms of our arrangement , conny ,
and i decided that i &apos;m no longer interested
in working for your crappy little hedge fund .
well , good ,
because i never really took
your petty little threats seriously .
what you claim to have is a copy
of the delusional ramblings of a suicidal socialite .
and if that printout even exists ,
there &apos;s no more validity to the accusations now
than there was 18 years ago .
what i have is a video
of your murdered henchman , frank stevens ,
tossing said socialite off a building ,
not to mention an incriminating conversation between you and your ...
whore
about your complicity in framing david clarke .
and i &apos;m assuming you have this video with you .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t be that reckless .
no . we have some negotiating to do first .
now ... why don &apos;t you make me your best offer ?
and i &apos;ll see what i can do about keeping that recording
out of the hands of federal prosecutors .
you really are son of a bitch , aren &apos;t you ?
yes .
it does appear that you despicable people
are starting to rub off on me .
第一季 第十一集
it &apos;s not surprising that , after this initial meeting ,
conrad has no intention
of simply handing over what we &apos;re asking for .
i think you should be prepared for this to proceed to trial .
no . we &apos;ll handle this matter privately .
then you may want to consider what you &apos;re willing to give up
to avoid that eventuality .
i &apos;ve already given up far too much .
well , i &apos;m afraid you can &apos;t have it both ways .
if talks break down in mediation ,
our best chance at defeating conrad will be
to expose his infidelities in open court .
this is a point you &apos;ve made abundantly clear .
there are other considerations .
what ,
charlotte and daniel ?
that &apos;s exactly what opposing counsel is counting on--
your maternal instincts working against your self @-@ interest .
you &apos;re playing right into their hands .
there &apos;s more than one way to lose a child in a divorce .
you &apos;re not gonna lose anything .
i happen to be quite good at what i do , victoria ,
but i can &apos;t do anything unless you start trusting me .
you said you were willing to get your hands dirty .
well , that time is fast approaching .
my hands are already dirty .
that prenup i signed before we were married ?
i lied .
i wasn &apos;t really pregnant when i signed it .
the contract is valid .
and as far as conrad knows ?
i miscarried at ten weeks .
that &apos;s exactly the kinds of secrets
you agreed not to keep from me .
i &apos;ll call you later in the day .
i want to know why you dropped my father &apos;s appeal .
i &apos;m sorry , ms. clarke ,
that &apos;s privileged information .
not anymore . i don &apos;t know if you heard ,
but my father was murdered in prison .
and as far as i &apos;m concerned , you &apos;re just as guilty
as the man who stabbed him to death .
what is that ?
every bit of evidence you could &apos;ve used
to prove his innocence .
they got to you , didn &apos;t they ?
victoria .
if you &apos;re looking for daniel , i thought he was with you .
no . actually , i was looking for you .
i was hoping you could help me find a photo
that the photographer took of me and daniel
on the bow of the yacht at your memorial day party .
it &apos;s our first picture that we took together ,
and , um , well , i &apos;m making a summer scrapbook
for his birthday .
aren &apos;t you inventive ?
well , what do you get the guy who has everything , right ?
and daniel really wanted to keep it simple , so ...
well , it doesn &apos;t get much simpler than a clambake .
i &apos;ll have ashley dig up the event photographer &apos;s number .
that &apos;s assuming that she &apos;s not too busy
helping out with daniel &apos;s party .
actually , she &apos;s recruited some of her own help for that--
jack porter and amanda clarke .
oh ?
amanda is the little girl
who lived in my cottage back in the early &apos; 90s .
daniel tells me that her father worked for conrad &apos;s company
before he--
yes , it was a horrible time .
do you remember amanda at all ?
vaguely .
poor dear .
well , if it isn &apos;t too awkward ,
i was thinking of inviting them to stay
after the party set up .
jack &apos;s become a very good friend ,
and , well , amanda looks like she could use one , so--
well , it sounds as if your mind is already made up .
i &apos;m certainly not going to get in your way .
do you mind if i grab daniel &apos;s squash racket
from the pool house for him ?
of course .
i &apos;m sure you know the way by now .
thanks .
hey . any luck drying out your computer ?
back online , baby .
shamu ...
will be live in 3 , 2 , 1 .
anything ?
it &apos;s hiding in plain sight , dora .
i &apos;m guessing backpack , duffel bag ,
on the floor , northwest corner--
wait , wait , wait . turn 10 degrees to your right .
walk forward .
got it .
thanks .
hit the road , baby .
tyler &apos;s 30 meters out .
emily .
dr. kutsch &apos;s office .
hi , this is dr. michelle banks .
i am treating a patient of dr. kutsch &apos;s
and , uh , i &apos;d like to discuss his case with him .
i &apos;m afraid dr. kutsch is still on leave of absence
after the attack .
uh , what &apos;s the patient &apos;s name ?
tyler barrol .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . would you mind holding a minute ?
i &apos;m gonna connect you with the detective .
they &apos;ve been searching for tyler barrol for several weeks .
yeah . i don &apos;t mind holding .
ah , come on . come on .
you gotta be kidding me . where is it ?
this is a serious antipsychotic .
it says if you stop taking it abruptly ,
it can cause a violent rebound effect .
cold turkey meets hot mess .
something i &apos;m sure tyler &apos;s psychiatrist
would be happy to testify to .
yeah , if his jaw weren &apos;t wired shut .
w @-@ what did you do with shamu ?
he &apos;s on my mantel .
i thought you could help me keep an eye on the place
in case tyler goes after daniel .
just like old times .
and we &apos;re in .
s.f.p.d. database .
dr. kutsch was attacked may 22nd .
that &apos;s only a few weeks before tyler showed up here .
only contact , family--
alexander barrol .
is that his father ?
more like his brother .
let &apos;s see ...
35 , works as a trauma surgeon
at san francisco medical center .
all right . let &apos;s bypass the police .
go straight to his family .
they &apos;ll ask fewer questions .
where &apos;s tyler now ?
still in the pool house .
call his brother .
see if you can get him
to come get him before he hurts anybody .
hello .
is this , uh , alexander barrol ?
yeah , who &apos;s this ?
nolan ross here , calling from the hamptons .
we &apos;re having a situation with your little brother .
you found ty ?
more like he found us .
and he &apos;s off his meds .
okay . listen , ty can be very unpredictable
when he &apos;s off his medication .
we &apos;re figuring that out .
keep him calm
a @-@ and try not to upset him until i get there .
i &apos;ll book a flight tomorrow--
no , no , no . tomorrow is too late , doc .
i &apos;m gonna have a jet fueled up , waiting for you at s.f.o.
it &apos;ll get you here by nightfall .
or i could hand him over to the police .
let me get there first . he needs medical attention .
i &apos;m on my way to the airport now .
perfect . thanks .
where &apos;s charlotte ?
oh , she went to buy a present for daniel .
why don &apos;t you come in ?
thank you .
tyler is blackmailing me .
what ?
claims to have a copy of that indicting speech
lydia was planning to deliver against us at that infernal benefit .
impossible . i shredded it .
he also claims to have all the video footage
from lydia &apos;s loft the night frank nearly killed her .
tyler &apos;s behind it ?
i don &apos;t believe it .
neither did i ,
until i called the dean of harvard business .
it turns out ,
tyler isn &apos;t even enrolled .
his family quit paying his tuition
last fall .
are you saying
that we &apos;ve been victims of an extortion plot
from the moment that tyler set foot in our house ?
oh , it was long before that .
no , i &apos;m thinking , he could &apos;ve been planning this
from the day he set his sights on our son .
oh , great . the tent &apos;s been confirmed for the beach .
tent ? i thought we were keeping this small .
and cozy . you &apos;ll love it .
oh , my god . i am so glad you guys are here .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i had a run @-@ in with tyler .
that &apos;s hardly what i &apos;d call news .
no , this is different . there &apos;s something wrong with him .
i found this in the pool house .
antipsychotics ?
are you for real ?
i think he &apos;s gone off them .
he trashed the place .
i &apos;m going over there .
be careful .
i &apos;m gonna come with you .
so will i.
no , no , stay here .
it &apos;s my fault he &apos;s here in the first place , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry , ash .
fresh steamers .
what &apos;s all this about ?
we &apos;re putting together a clambake
for daniel grayson &apos;s birthday .
you kidding me ?
no . why ?
uh , it &apos;s just that ...
jack used to have a thing for grayson &apos;s girlfriend
before you showed up .
and now he &apos;s throwing parties for her boyfriend .
it &apos;s so jack .
what are you yipping about , declan ?
just telling amanda that they don &apos;t make &apos; em
any easier going than you .
except when it comes to me , of course .
if you &apos;re talking about my being against
you and charlotte getting an apartment ,
that &apos;s not changing .
well , maybe it doesn &apos;t have to .
i took your advice . apartment &apos;s not happening .
knew you had a brain in there somewhere .
all right . i &apos;m off to dig a hole at emily &apos;s .
i &apos;ll come with .
okay .
so , um , you never told me how you and emily
came to be friends .
sammy practically tackled her in the park
earlier this summer .
and then he somehow managed to find his way to your old house
a couple of times .
that dog is amazing .
you two ever go out ?
if you count having dinner by accident ,
then yes , exactly once .
why ?
are you jealous ?
should i be ?
trust me , you &apos;ve got nothing to worry about .
i &apos;ve been waiting for you all my life .
what are you still doing here ?
waiting for you , danny .
always waiting for you .
you need to go .
now .
step ahead of you .
i got myself a ticket back to cali tonight .
i thought maybe you could come with me .
i mean , come on . we &apos;re best buds , remember ?
we &apos;re nothing , tyler . we &apos;re done .
oh , danny , danny , danny , danny .
i know you don &apos;t mean that .
oh , i do .
what are you afraid of ...
me ?
stop it .
i want you out of here and out of my life .
that &apos;s impossible .
we know way too much about each other .
and i know way too much about your family .
oh , are you threatening me ?
i don &apos;t know . do i need to ?
look at you , so perfect .
you really do lead such a charmed life .
good thing daddy &apos;s money takes up the slack ,
because you &apos;re really not that bright , are you ?
no , you &apos;re right .
i should &apos;ve realized
what a worthless parasite you are a lot sooner .
i &apos;d watch my mouth if i were you .
as pretty as it is , it could get you
into more trouble than you could handle .
who are you calling ?
the cops .
i guess you really are afraid of me .
maybe you &apos;re not as stupid as i thought .
have a nice life , danny .
the trick is
not to dig too deep , not to lay it on too thick .
it &apos;s kinda like a good first date .
like this ?
yeah . you &apos;re a natural .
if this heiress thing ever goes south ,
you got yourself a big future in clam baking .
how are things with amanda ?
they &apos;re good .
sometimes i can see
all that pain and anger fighting to take over .
i don &apos;t know that happiness
is ever really gonna come that easy to her .
not like it used to .
bam ! right in the nose , jack .
prepare for payback .
got you .
jack , amanda .
hi , daddy .
whoa , whoa . truce .
whoa ! truce ! truce . precious and delicious cargo .
yum . clams .
they look kinda gross .
yeah .
you know they bite ?
just make sure you &apos;re careful with her .
yeah , amanda &apos;s dealt with enough pain .
i &apos;m not about to let anything else hurt her .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m just making sure the gun stays handy
in case tyler &apos;s completely lost it .
is that really necessary ?
well , look , he &apos;s got no job , no place to live ,
and nothing left to lose .
he said he was getting on a plane for the west coast ,
but i don &apos;t know for sure .
i ...
i can &apos;t believe i never saw this side of him .
there &apos;s no way you could have .
his medication kept it hidden .
i gotta get this .
all right .
tyler &apos;s unspooling at warp speed .
where the hell is he now ?
well , based on his coordinates ,
you can take a serious chill pill .
he &apos;s at 31,000 feet , heading west to san francisco .
are you sure ?
positive .
unlike people ,
technology never lets me down .
what about his brother , is he still on his way ?
yeah , a bit of a wild @-@ goose chase ,
but the hamptons could always use another sexy surgeon .
have fun tonight .
you want to come by ?
thought it was only for friends and family .
well , that means you qualify .
i &apos;ll see you later .
surprise .
i want every copy of the videos
you made on that hidden camera .
you already have them .
all the recordings are embedded in that device .
i &apos;m not stupid , nolan .
guys like you back up everything--
every e @-@ mail , every conversation .
it &apos;s ... what did you call it , insurance ?
where &apos;s the camera , nolan ?
put that thing down .
tyler , let &apos;s talk about this like reasonable people .
get it . now !
all right . all right .
you &apos;re right . i do back everything up .
but these files are ...
special .
and i swear , i don &apos;t have the camera .
that was nolan .
apparently tyler is on a flight to san francisco .
we can put the gun
back in the desk back where it belongs .
how do you know for sure ?
it &apos;s nolan ross .
he has better intel than the state department .
after tyler blackmailed him ,
he put a bug on his phone .
i knew that you &apos;d track my gps ,
so i shipped my phone to cali ahead of me .
how does it feel to be the dumbest guy in the room ?
hey , come upstairs .
i have something i want to give you .
yeah , i bet you do , slut .
upstairs ? what &apos;s going on up there ?
well , as fun as our time together has been , nolan ,
it seems that i have a birthday party to get to .
i sure am looking forward to finding out
how that video camera made its way from my gym bag
all the way to emily &apos;s beach house .
ty--
oh , no , no , no , no , no . don &apos;t spoil it for me .
i &apos;ll ask her myself .
now then ...
what to do with you .
i wanted to give you this before everyone got here .
you remember that picture ?
of course .
the day we first met ,
after you spilled your drink on me .
on the night of our first date ,
you recited an oliver wendell holmes &apos; poem to me .
do you remember ?
&quot; where we love is home ,
home that our feet may leave , but not our hearts . &quot;
well , ever since that night , i &apos;ve been collecting poems
that remind me of you .
i know it hasn &apos;t been very long , but ...
you already feel like home to me .
there he is .
happy birthday , son .
thank you .
emily , lovely as always .
mm . thank you , mr. grayson .
um , excuse me .
ashley , thank you so much for your help .
it &apos;s what i do .
how are you holding up with all this tyler business ?
must be awful , realizing that you spent the entire summer
dating dr. jekyll and mr. hyde .
he &apos;s not a monster , emily . he &apos;s sick .
it &apos;s called empathy .
you might want to try a little .
so i checked in to sending you
to the du maurier conference in paris ,
but unfortunately ,
the dates back right up to your start date for school .
well , maybe a semester alongside you makes more sense .
maybe it does .
you know , we should talk about that .
happy birthday , sweetheart .
thank you .
i hope this year gives you everything you could ever wish for .
thank you , mom .
emily , hello .
hi .
ashley said you did this
without any waitstaff .
i can tell you , it &apos;s a refreshing change
from the tired old parties at our house .
mr. and mrs. grayson ,
i &apos;d like to introduce you to amanda clarke .
hello .
well , it &apos;s nice to see you .
it &apos;s a pleasure .
i spoke to conrad earlier today .
he seemed extra tense .
i think he knows what &apos;s coming .
i &apos;ve sent daniel to his grandmother &apos;s for the weekend
so i can finally put an end to it .
this is really happening then ?
yes .
come over after .
you can finally meet amanda .
more importantly , she can finally meet you .
i &apos;ll call you when i &apos;m on my way . 9 : 00 ?
okay .
david .
i love you .
i love you , too .
what brings you to town ?
i just came for a visit .
but i &apos;m thinking of making it more permanent .
i &apos;m gonna go to the beach and see if jack &apos;s ready for us .
i &apos;ll go .
and you stay with your boyfriend .
who is it ?
hello .
mr. ross ?
yes ! yes !
hey , is anybody there ?
there &apos;s my girl .
hi , daddy .
mr. grayson .
oh , please call me conrad .
conrad .
darling , you look lovely .
hello , declan .
mrs. grayson .
if everyone would head down to the beach ,
the food is ready .
got you something .
hello ?
hey , i &apos;m here !
mr. ross .
alex--
mr. ross , are-- are you all right ?
alexander ,
there &apos;s a key !
in the planter by the dolphin .
hurry !
jack &apos;s a real keeper .
you should try to hold on to that one .
that &apos;s the plan .
so did you know amanda was in town ?
it came to my attention .
and you didn &apos;t think to mention it ?
if she &apos;s indeed david &apos;s daughter ,
i wanted to look her straight in the eye
before i consulted with you .
and so far , i &apos;m not impressed .
all i can see is a pretty girl
with cheap shoes and limited social graces .
sounds like someone i once knew .
em ...
tyler &apos;s on his way to your house .
don &apos;t worry , nolan .
i &apos;ll make sure she gets the message .
okay , dinner &apos;s served , guys .
please help yourselves .
uh , charlotte told me about
her mother &apos;s little bribery attempt .
and please accept my sincerest apologies .
it &apos;s all right .
no . no , it &apos;s not . you are very important to charlotte .
and that makes you important to me .
if there &apos;s anything you need , don &apos;t hesitate to ask .
i would like to make a toast to daniel ,
on your birthday .
and to the entire grayson family .
i grow fonder of all of you every day .
and here &apos;s to my good luck
that emily happened into our lives at all .
salud .
cheers .
cheers .
cheers .
daniel ...
i can &apos;t believe how much time has passed
since i first brought you home from the hospital .
and in a way ,
i &apos;ve been working on this gift ever since .
sometimes the best way to show someone you love them
is to not buy them anything at all .
i hope you like it .
&quot; memories of daniel grayson . &quot;
&quot; daniel used to spend hours
sailing boats on georgica pond . &quot;
that was my favorite place in the whole world .
it &apos;s a memory book .
it &apos;s a collection of stories and photos of every summer
we &apos;ve ever come here since you were a boy .
i love it .
thanks , mom . it &apos;s beautiful .
that is so inventive .
i &apos;m gonna get the cake .
where the hell is it ?
what are you doing here ?
you do not want to mess with me right now .
where is that whale figurine that you stole from me ?
whale figurine ?
i saw the video feed from your b.f.f. nolan &apos;s house .
i know it &apos;s here .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
but you should get out . you &apos;re not welcome here .
give it to me now , you bitch !
get the hell out of my face .
you know the graysons can &apos;t stand you ?
leeching off of them all summer--
who can blame them ?
daniel told me you &apos;ve always given him the creeps ,
and even ashley thinks that you &apos;re a lying hypocrite .
and as for me ,
well , i &apos;ve always seen you for exactly what you are--
an impotent little misfit
who &apos;s gonna spend the rest of his life on the outside looking in .
emily .
wow , a breitling .
thanks , dad .
uh ... it makes quite a statement .
watch says a lot about a man ...
who he is , where he &apos;s going .
what deficiencies he &apos;s trying to compensate for .
where on earth is emily ?
i think she &apos;s just grabbing the cake .
oh , there she is .
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
come on , people . yes . big finish .
happy birthday , dear daniel
happy birthday to you
sit down , emily .
make a wish .
emily thorne--
poor little rich girl next door .
you &apos;ve had a target on my head since the day we met .
now you can see how it feels .
tyler , buddy , put the gun down .
shut up , danny !
you made it clear
that i &apos;m not your buddy , and now ...
you &apos;re on the losing end of things for once in your life .
tyler , i beg of you , don &apos;t hurt my children .
please think about what you &apos;re doing .
oh , believe me , i-- i have .
and this time , the graysons aren &apos;t the ones calling the shots .
now ...
how about a party game , huh ?
something we can all play .
let &apos;s call it ...
truth or die .
i ask a question , and you tell the truth .
if you don &apos;t ...
someone dies .
tyler , be reasonable .
you &apos;re not shooting anyone .
okay , conny , you &apos;re up first .
now let &apos;s take it all the way back
to david clarke and the summer of &apos; 93 .
you have three seconds to tell everyone the truth
about what really happened to david clarke .
clock &apos;s ticking , conrad .
tyler , please .
do it !
or i swear ,
once again , someone is going to die
because you were too weak to own up to your lies .
question is , who ?
why don &apos;t you calm down , son ?
this doesn &apos;t involve them .
wrong answer .
tyler ?
alex ...
what the hell are you doing here ?
i hadn &apos;t heard from you in a while .
i was worried .
we all were .
mom and dad don &apos;t care about me . they cut me off .
and you &apos;re just here so they can lock me up again .
no , no , that-- that was a mistake .
mom and dad want to make it up to you .
come on .
let &apos;s go talk about it , just the two of us .
get off of me ! let me go !
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
i recognize that wallet .
i bought it for frank about five years ago .
all right .
so they found frank &apos;s wallet in tyler &apos;s jacket .
what ?
yeah , and he &apos;s now
the prime suspect in their murder investigation ,
which means i &apos;m no longer in their crosshairs ,
which also means that you and that lawyer of yours
can have the battle royale you &apos;ve been gunning for .
you better buckle up . mm .
emily thorne ...
displaying emotion
while withholding your inner ninja at gunpoint .
you almost seemed like a mere mortal tonight .
there &apos;s a first
and a last time for everything .
i found it interesting that
the police didn &apos;t find any bullets in the gun ...
your gun .
i thought you always kept that thing loaded .
not always .
you never cease to amaze and ...
terrify me , maestro .
i &apos;m so sorry , ash .
yeah , me , too .
wow , that was fun .
well , we sure know how to pick &apos; em , hmm ?
duress impacts relationships in one of two ways .
it either tears people apart ...
or strengthens their connection ,
binding them tightly in a common objective .
you okay ?
yeah .
no . do you have any idea
what that guy was getting at ...
when he said &quot; the truth about david clarke &quot; ?
oh , he &apos;s probably just another conspiracy lunatic .
a lot of &apos; em out there .
maybe .
or maybe there really is more to the story than we &apos;ve been told .
some birthday .
if anything had happened to you or charlotte tonight ...
it didn &apos;t . we &apos;re both okay .
yeah , but still .
i don &apos;t know what i did to deserve you , emily thorne ,
but i can &apos;t imagine my life without you .
well , luckily , you don &apos;t have to .
oh , i shudder to think what you charge
for a late @-@ night house call .
trust me ,
this is one bill you should be delighted to pay .
i found a doctor who &apos;s willing to manufacture
the documents necessary to prove you had that miscarriage .
in the eyes of the law ,
