no , you shut up ! shut the hell up !
i ... okay , i am listening . what ? what are you trying to say ?
good . you listen to this , this is what i &apos;m gonna tell you .
i can come to your house .
i can come to your neighbors &apos; house .
you cannot !
i could come to your parents &apos; house ...
sir ...
and say that you welched on your debt .
you know where my parents live ?
you took out money and you &apos;re not paying it .
i &apos;ve paid every cent .
yes ,
you should ... i can do that , it is not illegal
for me to do that .
you know why it &apos;s not illegal ?
no , it is illegal .
no , no , i don &apos;t think you understand , maggie .
no , i do understand . i don &apos;t think that you ...
i have your social security number , maggie .
i have your e @-@ mail .
i paid my b ... my ...
i can ruin your life .
i paid my debts ok ,
i paid every single cent !
maggie , you &apos;re getting me angry .
see ? they cashed it .
i @-@ i deal with liars all day .
what ?
and i thought you weren &apos;t one of them .
i have paid you $ 8,900 ...
you have not , maggie , and i &apos;m gonna come to your house
and i &apos;m gonna knock on your door . and then i &apos;m gonna knock
on your neighbor &apos;s door .
that ... no ...
you can &apos;t do that .
and i &apos;m gonna say you welched .
maggie , you took out a student loan and you didn &apos;t repay .
i can do anything i damn please !
i already paid you , sir !
i can garnish your wages .
i can call you at work !
i have paid you .
i already paid you !
look , when you stop lying , maggie ,
i paid .
and want to get serious ,
call extension 853 , you got that ?
look , i paid !
i already p ... i paid !
853 . until then ,
don &apos;t kill yourself , lady , by k ...
sir ...
... by stepping in front of some train , okay ?
just pay your debts !
what ? !
that was yesterday . that &apos;s why i called lucca .
she wants to stop the harassment .
may i ?
yeah . um , maggie ,
this is jason crouse , our investigator .
nice to meet you .
so-- you know how much we charge , maggie ?
uh , yeah , lucca said $ 150 an hour .
it &apos;s worth it if you can make him stop calling .
and this is a.p.y. collections ?
yes . uh , bob bondi .
but i already complained to his manager
and he won &apos;t do anything .
well , we can bring suit .
often that &apos;s enough to scare them off .
but sometimes these places can be a bit intransigent .
and we would have to prepare for court .
i don &apos;t have a lot of money . i mean ,
i &apos;m still working temp jobs .
i should have gone to law school , like you .
instead , i went to colosseum--
worst educational experience ever .
but i can pay you a bit every month .
bob bondi , please .
oh , you won &apos;t get him at work .
i &apos;m not calling him at work .
hi , is this mrs. bondi ?
hi . i work with your husband , do ...
do you mind getting him for me ?
thank you .
bob . hey , how you doing ? this is jason .
no , i @-@ i know you don &apos;t know me .
hold on .
strangely enough , bob ,
i know you .
wait , wait , who ...
you live at
1245 rosalia avenue , you have ...
who is this ? how do you know that ?
this is jason crouse , bob .
i want you to focus .
i know your social security number ,
i know your address ,
i know your neighbors &apos; names .
how did you get this number ?
here &apos;s what i need you to do .
i need you go into work today ...
i &apos;m calling the police-- i don &apos;t ... i &apos;m calling the police .
okay . go ahead .
we &apos;ll talk about your priors in california .
my priors ? what are you talking about ?
background , bob . i am talking about your background .
i &apos;m sure your boss would be interested to know .
neighbors might be , too .
bob ?
what do you want ?
i want you to lay off of maggie ...
uh , rossum .
rossum . she paid her debt .
i am looking at a cancelled check here that you guys cashed .
the account is settled , bob .
look , look , i &apos;ll try to get this straightened out ,
but it &apos;s not just up to me , you got to know that .
who &apos;s it up to , bob ?
my manager , nelson olstead .
i only do what he says .
okay . i &apos;m gonna contact him .
don &apos;t call maggie again , bob .
i know your number .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s over yet . i think they &apos;re gonna
just put someone else on her account .
so we show &apos; em her cancelled check .
no .
my guess is a.p.y. is charging her twice .
that , or they &apos;re playing some sort of
a shell game with her money .
you can find out ?
how many hours can i charge ?
four .
okay . i will call you if it requires more .
so , our first case , good .
$ 150 an hour ?
i had to say something .
what is our price ?
$ 200 an hour .
on the next one .
i &apos;d go higher than $ 200 .
we need some working cash , mom .
i know . i &apos;m doing my best .
a responsible governor .
what &apos;s that ?
dad . in iowa .
i &apos;m here because it &apos;s the state
neighboring my own .
and you &apos;re saying this has nothing to do with running for president ?
no , what i &apos;m saying is that at the moment i &apos;not running .
but i do want to talk about pensions .
as a responsible governor ,
i think we have to start the conversation
about setting limits and rolling back pensions .
really ? you &apos;re sounding more like marco rubio .
i think we should stop sounding like a democrat
or a republican
and start sounding like americans .
i think that &apos;s what americans want .
i think that &apos;s what we need now .
the partisanship that &apos;s going on
in this election is killing us .
so did you have trouble getting your desk in here , dad ?
mm @-@ hmm . marissa , brightening up my day .
坚称不参选
this has not been focus @-@ grouped . this is simply what i believe .
but aren &apos;t you just playing back @-@ of @-@ the @-@ pack politics , governor ?
saying something controversial and wild
to get press coverage ?
oh , my god .
what a disaster .
well , i would not characterize
this as talking wild .
this is responsible fiscal accountability .
look , the fact of the matter is is that unions have
far too much control in this country . they are strangling ...
hey .
dad , i love you ,
but this is an intervention .
give me the remote .
peter chose ruth over you . you have to let it go .
what are you talking about ? this is my job .
no , this was your job . they fired you .
what are you getting out of this ?
i mean , besides this luxurious office ?
i &apos;m looking after alicia .
this isn &apos;t about alicia . you &apos;re getting back at peter .
what are you talking about ? that makes no sense .
i know .
and that &apos;s why you need to leave .
you watched his interview ,
scoffing the whole way through ,
but i don &apos;t see you going in there to tell him what he did wrong .
he &apos;s not here . he &apos;s in iowa .
then call him .
then let &apos;s go .
dad , you &apos;ll get a new job . you &apos;re desirable .
i &apos;ve never been fired in my life .
i know .
and it hurts . i &apos;ve been fired eight times .
it doesn &apos;t get easier .
come on .
give me the remote .
ruth eastman devised the strategy for that interview ,
and it makes peter look like an idiot .
the press is gonna have a field day . i can &apos;t leave
when there &apos;s a chance that peter will come to his senses
and realize ruth is foisting a losing strategy on him .
i love you . this is not healthy .
the remote , babe .
glad you came in . please , please , sit .
thank you , mr. erickson .
ronnie &apos;s fine .
ronnie . uh ...
well , i know you &apos;ll be mostly interfacing with howard ,
but as one of the three partners at lockhart / agos ,
i just wanted to personally welcome you .
well , thank you . and ...
i understand you &apos;ve been with the food service union
for 33 years . food and commercial services .
i ... oh , excuse me .
oh , i do have to take this . uh ...
no , please .
did you tell ronnie erickson i went to prison ?
do you ever knock ?
he &apos;s acting like i &apos;m a crook .
did you tell him ? ! if the guy doesn &apos;t
take a shine to you , that &apos;s your problem .
you crossed a line , howard .
you can &apos;t come barging in here
and accuse me of , what , truth @-@ telling ?
so you admit it .
since when is truth- telling a crime ?
you ... you want to talk ,
how about you , now ?
i &apos;ll tell you what the problem is .
you do zero , howard .
i &apos;m the guy that brings in ...
you sit around with your pants down , literally !
nelson olstead . i &apos;m the manager of a.p.y. collections . hello .
hey , thank you for meeting me . i &apos;m with avon @-@ isolade ,
a debt brokerage out of gary , indiana .
you want to buy my bad debt ?
come on , there &apos;s no such thing
as bad debt . just bad collectors .
let me ask you something , broker to broker .
you ever double dip any of these ?
no . there &apos;s enough real debt .
we don &apos;t have to make it up .
i mean , debt collecting might not be glamorous ,
but it &apos;s legit . at least the way i do it .
what about your other offices ? what about michigan ?
we don &apos;t have a michigan office .
then why do i have this canceled check out of muskegon , michigan ?
i have no idea , but we don &apos;t have any offices there .
thank you .
the address you sent your checks to--
did it change recently ?
what do you mean ?
this check-- the @-@ the most recent one .
how &apos;d you know to send it to michigan address ?
what &apos;s going on ?
your last check was cashed at a michigan bank .
there are no a.p.y. offices there .
it was from a voice mail .
you still have it ?
this is a courtesy message from a.p.y. collections .
we &apos;re calling to let you know that the address
for remittance of your scheduled loan payments has changed .
it &apos;s not bondi .
please send remittances
to 390 deerhorn park . suite 777 .
thank you .
wait , that wasn &apos;t a.p.y. ?
that was a scam artist .
he either hacked into the a.p.y. network
or he bought your records .
collection agencies are wide open to abuse .
so her last payment was to the wrong person ?
yes .
oh , my god , so i really do owe $ 8,000 to a.p.y. then , don &apos;t i ?
yeah , legally .
i ... there &apos;s got to be something i can do .
i @-@ i can &apos;t pay it again .
can i make an argument here , mom ?
yeah , sure . what &apos;s up ?
okay , the settlement you won for the chagall painting--
your payout was $ 4,000 for 20 hours of work
right .
as opposed to $ 500,000
if it had been on contingency .
yes , but the rules on contingency
for probate are very strict .
it would &apos;ve been almost the same as our hourly rate .
oh . okay , well , i didn &apos;t know that .
but on these other cases , can &apos;t we start
taking them on contingency ?
sure , but the cases that come through the door
are too small . we want the money up front .
maybe we shouldn &apos;t be taking such small cases .
look , i want bigger cases too , grace ,
but we need to win the small ones to get the big ones .
is there any way to turn the smaller ones
into the bigger ones ?
well , um , i don &apos;t know how ,
but that sounds good .
i &apos;m just worried about our bills
i know . i am too , honey .
but this is what starting out looks like .
what ?
could you get me everything you can on colosseum university ?
sure . what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a for @-@ profit school .
it &apos;s about to be sold .
does that mean money ?
it might .
well , i &apos;ll get right on it .
you admitted earlier . and now you &apos;re pretending
uh , okay . listen up .
you doing something to benefit this firm .
come on . sit down .
... guilty of telling the truth .
am i the only one who &apos;s upset by this ?
is howard lyman really what this firm is about now ?
you better watch it , buddy boy . i am this close
to filing suit .
in order to sue somebody ,
you &apos;d have to know how .
there he goes again ,
undercutting me with ageist comments .
oh , all right . all right .
what ? !
cary , can i have a word ?
i am aggrieved ,
i tell you . i am aggrieved .
you have to stop with the ageist comments , cary .
what ? !
are you seriously siding with him ?
cary , you are not a member of a protected class .
howard is .
i want
in @-@ house mediation .
howard , please .
i &apos;ve consulted an attorney .
who , alicia ?
i know my rights pursuant to my partnership agreement .
and if you refuse , my only recourse is to sue .
we &apos;re gonna keep trying
to get your money back .
but it doesn &apos;t look good .
but there might be a way to cancel out your debt entirely .
we &apos;ve done some research on your university .
they &apos;ve been subject to dozens of complaints
to the attorney general &apos;s office .
they &apos;re a for @-@ profit school .
they treat education like a product .
and based on what you &apos;ve told us , it &apos;s a defective product .
you borrowed $ 46,000 for an education
that didn &apos;t yield a job .
you want me to sue colosseum ?
we want you to let us sue colosseum .
they &apos;re about to be acquired by a private equity firm out of texas .
a lawsuit would have to be disclosed to the potential buyer ,
and that could tank the deal .
look , i can &apos;t afford a big lawsuit .
we know .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to take this on contingency .
you don &apos;t pay anything .
our payment comes from the settlement .
what do you say , mags ?
that &apos;s a nifty theory there , counselors .
it &apos;s not a theory . it &apos;s a fact .
our client bought an education from you ,
and it hasn &apos;t done what you said it would .
where did you go to school , mrs. florrick ?
georgetown .
did they teach you to read there ?
excuse me ?
our enrollment agreement .
your client signed one .
and paragraph 23 is the ...
an arbitration clause .
oh , you can read .
it clearly states that any grievances must be settled
in arbitration and settled within 18 months of graduation .
your client graduated 17 months ago ,
so you do the math .
where is she ? ! ruth !
did you see this ?
well , then , who the hell is my constituency !
i mean , look at this ! and this one !
it &apos;s a nightmare , ruth !
it &apos;s not , governor .
foot in mouth disease ! that &apos;s what they &apos;re saying !
this is all part of a strategy .
ruth , don &apos;t be ridiculous . this is a screw @-@ up .
calm down , sir .
everything is under control .
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
is everything all right ?
i was gonna show you this later , mr. governor .
after i got more information .
i saw the interview in iowa .
would you like to discuss it ?
is this real ?
as real as anything , sir .
it &apos;s from our internals .
look , if there &apos;s any way i can help ...
you &apos;re in second place .
and climbing .
you &apos;re not selling yourself to the press , mr. governor .
they won &apos;t embrace you , anyway .
we &apos;re going right to the people .
yes , you &apos;re saying controversial things .
yes , it &apos;s the same strategy as the republicans .
but it &apos;s working , and you &apos;re winning .
ruth , i am so sorry i flew off the handle .
terrific job !
each day &apos;s an adventure .
okay , now what &apos;s next ?
what we &apos;re gonna do is keep pushing this anti @-@ union message .
next , we go to illinois management coalitions ...
good morning .
let me start by saying that this is not a courtroom
and i am not a judge .
but in all ways , the decision here is final .
arbitration takes the place of litigation .
mediation does not replace litigation .
it is an attempt to settle differences amicably ,
which is in the best interests of the firm
and in your own best interests ,
since you are partners in this firm .
let &apos;s go around the table first , and ...
please share your names and your most embarrassing experience .
that was a joke , people .
uh , you have my permission to lighten up .
why don &apos;t we start to my right .
lucca quinn . representing maggie rossum .
alicia florrick . the same .
carter schmidt .
representing colosseum university .
good . we got through that without an argument .
we &apos;re well on our way .
i &apos;m geoffrey solomon . i &apos;ll be your spirit guide .
we will hear evidence and follow the admissibility rules
as determined by rule 90
of the illinois supreme court .
so , counselors , call your first witness .
why does he get to go first ?
i &apos;m doing it alphabetically .
eh . convenient .
cary , what are your grievances ?
how are you ... aggrieved ?
he &apos;s embarrassing in front of clients .
that &apos;s code for &quot; old . &quot;
and he sticks his nose where it doesn &apos;t belong .
that &apos;s code for &quot; jewish . &quot;
you teach at colosseum
in the dental hygienist program , ms. howe ?
yes .
and what subject did you teach my client ?
periodontics .
are you a periodontist ?
no . i &apos;m a dental hygienist .
a licensed dental hygienist ?
well , i was . i may have let my certification lapse .
when ?
uh , a couple years ago .
13 years ago , actually .
and you were never licensed in the state of illinois .
i know this isn &apos;t court , but i don &apos;t think
she can both ask and answer the questions .
counselor .
how could my client have received an adequate education
if you &apos;re not a licensed hygienist ?
because i &apos;m a good teacher .
all my students think so .
no further questions .
where were you licensed ?
ohio .
and dental anatomy doesn &apos;t change
when you cross state lines , does it ?
i don &apos;t think so .
okay .
nothing further .
ms. howe ,
uh , this is a final exam you gave my client last year .
can you please read the first question ?
&quot; what does the phrenic nerve innervate ? &quot;
what &apos;s the answer to that ?
objection , your honor .
oh , no . i @-@ i think we could all benefit from that answer .
the exam was multiple choice ,
and you &apos;ve put a piece of tape over all the choices .
right . uh , go ahead . remove the tape .
we &apos;ll wait .
what &apos;s the answer ?
&quot; a. &quot;
no . actually , it &apos;s &quot; d. &quot;
geezer ,
gargoyle , old fart ,
flaccido domingo .
that one hurt especially , given my devotion to the opera .
and , uh ... and my sexual prowess .
and you would like this name @-@ calling to stop ?
yes , i would .
i &apos;ve spent 30 years in this business .
i think i deserve a little respect .
diane , do you have a minute ?
and where are you going ?
we just need a moment , howard .
objection .
you cannot have an ex parte conversation
in the middle of our trial .
you &apos;re the one who called howard an old geezer .
okay .
i &apos;m not the only one
guilty of a few indiscretions .
cary , please . we &apos;re only going through this
to keep howard from suing .
are you sure you &apos;re not hanging me out to dry ?
i want your ex parte communication noted for the record .
there is no record , howard . we &apos;re just trying to clear the air .
and i think we have accomplished that ,
i want to call a witness .
you can &apos;t call a witness . this isn &apos;t a hearing .
i call diane lockhart to the stand .
hello , father .
i want to run something by you ,
but i need your undivided attention .
i &apos;m thinking of taking pole dancing classes .
what do you think ?
if it makes you happy , dear .
do you know eyal naftali ?
is that a club ?
he &apos;s the chief of staff to israel &apos;s communications minister .
he wants to talk to you about running his campaign .
his campaign for what ?
the knesset .
and , in a few years , prime minister .
how do you know this ?
i knew his daughter in the idf .
her dad contacted me .
i see what you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m giving you the chance to make an impact , dad .
it &apos;s &quot; have &quot; an impact , &quot; make &quot; a difference .
you want netanyahu out , here &apos;s your chance .
mr. naftali is offering you twice as much as you &apos;re making now .
how do you know what i make ?
i &apos;m a witch .
talk to him , dad .
what do you have to lose ?
82 % of colosseum graduates find employment
within a year of graduation .
what employment ?
what do you mean ?
you said 82 %
find employment within a year of graduating .
i &apos;m just asking : what kind of employment
are we talking about here ?
professional employment ? fast food work ?
temping , like maggie ?
any employment .
how many work less than 15 hours a week ?
i have no idea .
well , we do . 33 % .
how many work minimum wage jobs ?
we run a high @-@ risk ,
low @-@ functioning population , miss .
fifty @-@ five percent .
why don &apos;t you put that in your brochure ?
let &apos;s not badger , shall we ?
the reality is the vast majority of colosseum students end up
worse off than before they started .
they wind up unemployable and saddled with massive debt .
please , your honor ,
do we need the speeches ?
no , we don &apos;t .
counselor , is there a question here ?
nothing further .
president stenborg ,
you make it sound like you don &apos;t care
about the quality of the education .
is that true ?
no .
i care very much .
but i also care about running a successful business .
you supply a service .
yes .
traditionally , higher education is a product
marketed only to the elite .
and you &apos;re making it available to the masses ?
exactly .
if we didn &apos;t do it , these students would never get
into another institution .
do you mislead prospective students ?
no . we &apos;re not allowed to .
we &apos;re subject to the same laws every business must follow .
our customers get exactly
what they pay for , no more , no less .
okay , i think we can all agree that colosseum is not harvard .
oh , that &apos;s not what we &apos;re claiming .
yes , but you &apos;re focusing
on the ways in which colosseum
doesn &apos;t measure up to traditional notions
of higher education .
no , we &apos;re focusing on deceptive practices .
then i &apos;d suggest you stop presenting evidence
on colosseum being inadequate ,
and instead focus on the ways they actually lied
to their students .
can i help you ?
yeah . i was actually hoping
to rent out these offices , if they &apos;re not occupied .
they &apos;re open . last occupant just used it as a mail drop ,
and he took off a month ago .
how much square footage are you looking for ?
like 800,
but i &apos;d love to take a look . jason crouse .
i run a skip @-@ tracer business .
sure . nice to meet you .
harrison strode .
i manage this location .
a lot of people like the prestigious address .
ah , here we go .
well , the size is right .
would you mind getting those shades for me ?
sure . it &apos;s $ 600 a month ,
with utilities .
it &apos;s wi @-@ fi ready ,
and ... the view is not bad .

alicia , how &apos;s arbitration ?
not good . you busy ?
never .
the arbiter needs some lies that colosseum tells its students .
can you find something ?
sure . what &apos;s the time line ?
tomorrow .
all right . let me see what i can do .
great . thanks .
good @-@ bye .
surprise !
marissa !
hey , what &apos;s up ?
it &apos;s been a while .
i know .
your office looks amazing . i can &apos;t believe
you did this all without me .
i thought you were in israel .
i was . designing purses . really cool .
leather and macrame . but then i got worried
my dad was having a nervous breakdown .
about what ? you being away ?
no .
do you have any cereal ?
sure .
what was i saying ?
your dad-- you &apos;re worried about him .
he &apos;s having trouble
letting go .
running peter &apos;s campaign was his life .
well , he &apos;s my chief of staff now .
i know . i heard .
but ...
you disapprove ?
no . i just ...
you know ...
you &apos;re right , i don &apos;t approve .
why ?
he &apos;s about to pass up
an opportunity to run a campaign in israel--
a big campaign-- because of you .
well , i never guilted eli into anything-- he wanted to stay .
i know . and that &apos;s why i &apos;m hoping you &apos;ll fire him .
marissa ...
that &apos;s the only way he &apos;ll move on .
convince him you don &apos;t want him . i know it &apos;s hard on you .
don &apos;t do it for you , do it for him .
please fire him .
what are you looking to major in , jason ?
i was thinking dental hygiene .
are you guys accredited with the ada ?
uh , well , i &apos;ll tell you the truth , right now we &apos;re not .
it &apos;s pending , but ... you don &apos;t want to be a dental hygienist .
i mean , come on , look at you , a guy like you ?
you like cars ? we got a great automotive tech program .
yeah ? how do your graduates do in the workforce ?
uh ... uh , look , you know , i can show you the stats .
we got time for that . but do you want to get some lunch ?
you know , let me , uh ... let me think about it .
thank you .
wait , ja ...
are you a vet ?
yeah .
why ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m about to make your day .
see , most of our students , they got to come up
with at least ten percent of the tuition out of pocket .
but you , you get the golden ticket .
you got , you got federal loans , plus the g.i. bill .
let me show you .
all right .
you got something .
what ?
ninety @-@ ten .
i have no idea what that is .
you need to call this recruitment officer--
randy duffield .
what &apos;s his number ?
no .
call him as your next witness .
mr. duffield , can you please tell us about the 90 / 10 rule ?
it is a federal law that prohibits
for @-@ profit colleges from receiving more than
90 % of their revenues from student aid .
and where does the other ten percent come from ?
from the students themselves . their own private funds .
but there &apos;s a loophole , isn &apos;t there ?
i &apos;m not sure what you mean .
veterans . g.i. bill
and dod tuition assistance-- that can be counted
as private money on the ten percent side .
i &apos;m ... not sure where we &apos;re going with this .
our client , maggie rossum , is a veteran .
so veterans can go to colosseum for no money out of pocket .
do you target veterans
in order to take advantage of this 90 / 10 rule ?
no .
really ?
did you receive this e @-@ mail
from colosseum &apos;s head of recruitment last year ?
it suggests that you lure veterans
from veteran hospitals and wounded warrior centers .
objection as to &quot; lure . &quot;
sure .
find another word for &quot; lure . &quot;
persuade .
isn &apos;t it a fact that you persuade
poor , unqualified applicants
to take out loans they can &apos;t possibly repay ?
that &apos;s just not true .
nothing further .
mr. duffield , is mrs. florrick spinning your words ?
yes .
you believe in what you do ? look ,
our students , they @-@ they may not be the best and the brightest--
i &apos;m sorry to say that ,
but it &apos;s true-- but it doesn &apos;t mean
that they don &apos;t deserve a chance .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to call maggie rossum .
did you or did you not , ms. lockhart ,
suggest that i catheterize myself
at a client meeting which took place
in this very room less than a week ago ?
you were getting up to go to the bathroom every five minutes , howard .
answer the question : yes or no ?
howard , we all make jokes , including you ,
about everyone at the firm .
i &apos;ll take that as a yes .
cary gets made fun of for his youthful appearance .
twerp , pimple , preschooler .
and we &apos;ve all made fun of david lee for ...
well , you know .
and i &apos;ve heard you more than once joke
about the pole stuck about diane &apos;s ass .
excuse me ?
no . come on , that ... that &apos;s different .
how is that different ?
i &apos;m not talking about harmless ribbing .
people ...
pour prune juice in my coffee .
they leave adult diapers in my office .
oh , come on , howard .
what ? they do .
no one is leaving adult diapers in your office , howard .
i think he wants us to follow him .
&quot; property of howard lyman . &quot;
huh ?
and ...
here &apos;s a ...
a bib ...
... and a catheter .
i had nothing to do with that .
but you &apos;re creating the climate .
well , it &apos;s a diaper , howard ,
it &apos;s not a burning swastika .
these young associates , they look up to you .
they follow your cues ,
and this is what they do .
they harass me . they ...
they humiliate me .
howard , i am so sorry .
and i want you to know we are gonna take meaningful steps
to correct this ageist culture
that we may have unwittingly fostered .
would you consider yourself a good student , ms. rossum ?
i don &apos;t know . i ...
i did my best .
good .
that &apos;s all any of us can hope for--
doing our best .
now , in order to do your best ,
you would need to show up for ...
classes , right ?
would you agree to that ?
well , that depends .
it does ?
you think you can be a good student
even if you don &apos;t show up for class ?
i would object to that , mr. solomon .
i understand why , but no .
i think that you can be a good student in a lot of ways .
i understand why you would say that .
according to your attendance records ,
you missed two @-@ thirds of your classes .
do you think that &apos;s accurate , or ...
do you think it &apos;s wrong ?
i had to work a lot to pay my bills .
what about books , the ones assigned for class ?
did you ... buy any ?
did i buy any textbooks ?
no , but i ...
so aside from tuition ,
what did you spend all that student loan money on ?
they told me i could use that money for living expenses .
living expenses incurred while you weren &apos;t
buying books or attending classes .
looks more like a defective user
than a defective product .
objection !
objection !
he made it sound really bad .
that &apos;s because it is really bad , maggie .
the credit card interest was eating me alive
paying off that card seemed like the smart thing to do . i ...
and it wasn &apos;t illegal .
well , maybe not .
but it still doesn &apos;t look good .
did i miss classes ? yes .
but that &apos;s because i was working two jobs .
and i always got notes from somebody when i couldn &apos;t make it .
what about the books ?
we &apos;d get pdf versions ,
print them out , pass them around . i mean ...
we all tried to make the best of it ,
we really did .
who &apos;s &quot; we &quot; ?
um , my study group .
we &apos;d just kind of share horror stories ,
you know , job tips , that kind of thing .
how many students ?
look , we just need
to enumerate ways colosseum lied to you .
we just need to wait .
i see you &apos;re running an adult day care now .
you wanted to talk ?
yes .
i &apos;ll get right to the point , eli .
i just don &apos;t trust you anymore .
i need to be working with someone ...
different ...
someone who gets along with ruth ,
who has her confidence .
did marissa talk to you ?
no .
eli ... you have an ulterior motive here ,
and you know it-- you are using me .
yes , but ... you &apos;re using me , too .
i keep ruth from messing with your life .
well , i can do that on my own . no , eli .
i really appreciate everything you &apos;ve done for me ,
but now ...
we need to part ways .
you &apos;re serious ?
yes .
we both need a fresh start .
i know it won &apos;t be easy , but ...
it &apos;s time .
good @-@ bye , eli .
no , i agree .
i think maybe a class action makes sense .
wait .
i &apos;m not sure if we have the wherewithal ...
actually , a class action isn &apos;t possible here .
why is that ?
the enrollment agreement you signed .
when you registered at colosseum ,
you signed a document
saying you wouldn &apos;t sue the school .
i signed a hundred pieces of paper . are you serious ? !
we can really sign away our rights ?
unfortunately , yeah ,
legally , you can .
okay , so the school can screw all of us ,
and then trick us into not doing anything about it ?
a class action suit isn &apos;t possible , but a debt strike is .
it &apos;s already happening at another for @-@ profit .
corinthian college .
this is a list of 350 colosseum graduates
who are ready to default collectively
and suffer the consequences ,
unless you intervene with the department of education
and the loan companies to settle their debts .
really ? getting desperate , are we ?
it &apos;s a debt strike .
let &apos;s see how that will play with your resale value .
or you can settle .
we &apos;re listening .
okay , now i need everyone
to take the cotton balls in front of you .
pick one up , please .
just one .
okay ,
now insert it into your right nostril , please .
good and tight .
okay , now take the cardboard glasses ...
look at him . he &apos;s enjoying himself .
they &apos;re coated with a diffused filter .
and put them over your eyes , please .
now take the kernels of corn .
a handful will do .
and put them in each shoe .
come on .
sensitivity training . let &apos;s be sensitive .
ah , you know what ?
i think howard planted those diapers ,
so we would have to do this .
here we go .
good .
now i want everyone to walk .
and do something simple like tie your shoes .
go .
it hurts .
this is what it &apos;s like to be 80 years old .
this is what it &apos;s like to walk .
isn &apos;t that right ,
howard ?
sometimes ... every day is a struggle .
i &apos;m sorry i take naps , but now you know why .
all ... all day , it hurts .
i think howard could use all of your support right now .
this is not happening .
i think unions do have a place .
but if we &apos;re gonna stay competitive
in a global economy , then ,
i think we have to look
beyond the standard management @-@ labor paradigm .
excuse me . excuse me , guys .
then you agree with your husband , mrs. florrick ?
i do .
i think creative solutions are essential .
so you &apos;re against unions ?
no .
but i support my husband when he says
he &apos;s looking for new ways to avoid strikes .
then what do you think of your wife &apos;s debt strike , mr. governor ?
mr. governor , i think we have to get into the ballroom .
actually , you don &apos;t .
your wife is organizing a debt strike
among the students at colosseum university .
well , i support my wife .
even though she &apos;s unionizing ?
i would rather look at the facts ...
you are organizing a strike , aren &apos;t you , mrs. florrick ?
unfortunately , attorney @-@ client privilege prevents me
from saying ...
i think we &apos;ve had enough here .
oh , it &apos;s okay for your wife to strike , but not my union ?
you gave alicia the debt strike idea , didn &apos;t you ?
you know peter told me to keep a handle on the family ,
and now we &apos;ve got alicia stirring up trouble
on an issue that &apos;s no @-@ win for the campaign !
it &apos;s not no @-@ win for the campaign ...
peter can &apos;t be saying
&quot; vote for me &quot; in one breath , and &quot; don &apos;t worry
about paying back the federal government &quot; in the next .
oh . you know , you &apos;re right . i didn &apos;t think of that .
i guess he won &apos;t want to choose between
alienating the unions or business interests , either .
you &apos;re killing peter &apos;s campaign !
no , i &apos;m not . i &apos;m not running peter &apos;s campaign .
mr. naftali , eli gold .
oh , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m so sorry . i didn &apos;t realize
it was so late with you there .
i &apos;ve given your offer a lot of thought ,
and , uh , as tempting as it is ...
i &apos;m gonna stay put .
molly tuff ?
yes ?
colosseum class of 2013 ?
yeah . who are you ?
i think this is yours .
it &apos;s your payment on your student loan .
how &apos;d you get it ?
from the person who scammed you .
i &apos;m a private investigator .
i have a client who fell for the same scam .
sent her payment to that address , too .
i can &apos;t believe you got it back .
i never have luck like this .
oh , my god .
what ?
they just called yesterday with a new address .
can i get that address from you ?
hello , jackass .
eli . hi .
i &apos;m staying on .
okay . sounds good .
mrs. florrick ,
i apologize if i &apos;m interrupting .
what do you need , mr. schmidt ?
just to deliver this . colosseum is suing
you and lucca quinn for tortious interference with contract .
a judge will probably knock this down .
i don &apos;t think so .
there &apos;s a colorable argument that we crossed a line
when we encouraged students not to pay back their debt .
we escalated , so , they escalated further , and now we need to ...
keep going .
no , i was gonna say deescalate .
lucca &apos;s right .
the debt strike is working . colosseum stock is falling .
colosseum has not been willing to back down so far .
not to us .
but what if it was someone they cared about even more ,
that was applying the pressure ?
you don &apos;t happen to know anything
about this shareholder derivative suit
that &apos;s been filed against us , do you ?
absolutely not , but ...
if i had to guess , i &apos;d say the theory is
that colosseum &apos;s predatory recruitment tactics
are a violation of the school &apos;s
fiduciary duty towards its shareholders .
am i right ?
uncanny .
just to recap , you &apos;re now facing a debt strike
which is destroying your not @-@ very @-@ good name ,
a shareholder suit which could bankrupt you in court ,
and if either continues ,
the feds are going to investigate and revoke
your eligibility to receive funding .
what do you want ?
i &apos;m sorry to bother you so late .
i @-@ i just wanted to drop something off .
what is it ?
belongs to maggie .
her $ 8,000 ?
yeah .
from the scammer ?
yeah .
how did you do that ?
i persuaded him .
how ?
by being persuasive .
you &apos;re not gonna tell me , are you ?
i will tell you whatever you want to know .
i get to the end of the day , i &apos;m so tired , sometimes i ...
can &apos;t think straight .
that is why i drink .
what do you drink ?
