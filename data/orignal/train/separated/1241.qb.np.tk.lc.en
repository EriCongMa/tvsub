why are you here ?
police asked me to stay .
i &apos;m talking about the funeral .
if charlotte was as horrible as you told the judge she was ,
why did you go ? did you lie in court ?
was it all an act , so you could walk out like a victim ?
do you have feelings for--
i don &apos;t even know if he feels the same way .
i think that you should find out .
you &apos;re welcome to stay here as long as you want .
i know you &apos;re lost right now .
i know you &apos;re , you &apos;re filled with anger
and you &apos;re full of despair--
what the hell are you talking about ?
charlotte . i know that you did this to protect me .
what the hell was ezra doing there ?
what &apos;s wrong ? who &apos;s that from ?
it &apos;s from detective calderon .
they just confirmed that the tape was erased .
he needs to own up to what he did ?
you &apos;re asking me to confess to a murder .
where did you go that night after you left aria ?
get out !
we &apos;re gonna leave .
but you two better figure this out .

我会让你开口的
艾瑞亚
you guys , i &apos;m so sorry .
i was up late last night prepping for town hall meeting .
i turned my phone off .
我会让你开口的
who the hell sent that ?
我会让你开口的
someone who has our new number .
like ali ?
we all know i am at the top of her suspect list .
maybe that &apos;s why sara &apos;s hanging around .
she might not be able to cut around me
but she can still type a text .
so i &apos;m guessing everything she told the judge
about charlotte was a lie .
maybe she came back here to mourn the death of her mentor
not her tormentor .
so we &apos;re @-@ we &apos;re definitely saying that sara &apos;s the stalker ?
i &apos;m telling you guys that bitch wasn &apos;t stockholmed .
&apos;well , the only thing we know for sure is that&apos;
she has spent two years helping charlotte torture us .
that &apos;s plenty of time to perfect the art of cyber stalking .
or it could just be some techie at the phone company
with too much time on his hands .
god , i miss new york .
i am addicted to blue bottle coffee .
one cup and you feel like you can handle anything
your boss throws at you .
staplers , her phone--
you boss literally throws things at you ?
wait . what are you doing ?
i lied to lorenzo yesterday and he knows it .
i don &apos;t have any time to play games .
like the techie &apos;s really gonna respond .
汉娜
okay , the techie &apos;s typing .
&quot; yes . &quot;
so you &apos;re with dr. rollins ?
ah , sounds peaceful there .
okay , well , give us a call if you need anything .
bye .
so alison &apos;s at the rollins &apos; family farm in eastern pennsylvania .
they &apos;re on a dairy tour right now .
if ali &apos;s really tasting amish cheese
do you think she could be the cyber stalker ?
if is a really big two letter word , hanna .
whoever this person is they think that we know
who killed charlotte and they &apos;re sending us these texts
because they want us to rat that person out .
okay , but we do know who killed her .
don &apos;t we ?
ezra said he didn &apos;t do it .
maybe that &apos;s what you heard , aria ,
but the rest of us heard
ezra kick us out of his apartment .
guys .
and every member of this police department is taking this case
not just seriously but personally .
without going into detail that can harm the investigation
i can tell you that we are narrowing down
our list of suspects .
we &apos;re confident we know what the murder weapon was
and we will find it .
the person who killed charlotte dilaurentis
will be brought to justice .
aria .
oh , what &apos;s my dad doing here ?
looks like he got a room .
i didn &apos;t know he was seeing anyone .
yeah , it &apos;s because they &apos;re doing it at the radley .
it &apos;s a 9 iron .
you could kill somebody with that .
do we really think that &apos;s a murder weapon ?
does ezra play golf ?
hey , guys , enjoy !
sabrina , hey !
can i talk to you for a second ?
it &apos;s aria , right ?
yes . hey !
umm , uh , look , so i &apos;ve been helping ezra
out with his new book and i &apos;m little worried .
he hasn &apos;t been answering any of my calls .
ezra &apos;s out of town .
are you sure ?
i saw him leave , so yeah !
do you know where he went ?
when he gets like this , i &apos;ve learned it &apos;s best not to ask .
like this ?
there is dark and brooding .
and then there &apos;s dark and depressed .
i would check that box for ezra .
look , he disappears a lot . he &apos;s usually back in few days .
look , he @-@ he didn &apos;t tell me he was going out of town
but i know that he finished the next chapter of his book
and i &apos;m supposed to proofread the pages
before i e @-@ mail them to my boss .
so ... could you just let me into the loft ?
please . mate , my job is on the line here .
i hear you , aria .
but if i let you into my boss &apos; apartment
my job &apos;s gonna be on the line .
sorry .
thanks for making the coffee this morning .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry , i had to run to a breakfast meeting
and then ... all of this .
you didn &apos;t sneak out because of--
no ! god , no !
last night was perfect .
did you know that 89 % of all young voters
when recently surveyed said that the recent economic slump
has forced them to put their life plans on hold ?
gil , what &apos;s up ?
this was updated this morning .
候选人菲利普
it &apos;s everything you &apos;d wanna know about
the phillips &apos; family and then some .
i will eat , live and breathe this . thank you , gil .
wow . that is a thick file .
yeah !
okay , candidate phillips .
she gave the commencement speech at wesleyan
before earning her jd at georgetown .
her favorite ice cream is actually sorbet
and she often binges on candy corn
while on the campaign trail .
oh , candy corn ?
that &apos;s a serious sugar addiction .
yeah !
伊冯 · 菲利普
and here is the recon on her family .
i mean , we have to assume that they know as much about us
as we know about them .
i know it &apos;s a little awkward considering .
yeah , you said yvonne was nice , right ?
yeah , yeah , we &apos;ve only hung out a couple of times
but ... she seems okay .
cool , umm , if i didn &apos;t think this town was small when i left
it certainly is now .
hey , umm , i was , uh , thinking about taking a drive
to see toby .
yeah , i &apos;m cool with that .
so since we , uh ..
i .. should i get my own place ?
is that what you want ?
is that what you want ?
look , i just need you to promise me one thing .
okay .
i will always get the first cup of coffee in the morning .
spencer
i promise i will not come between you
and your relationship with caffeine .
thank you .
wow ! it &apos;s so short . you look hot .
where are you ?
i &apos;m at the airport .
babe , you &apos;re leaving early .
mm @-@ hmm . is that a problem ?
never .
i &apos;m gonna rent a car .
you got any preference ?
oh , you don &apos;t need one .
lucas is letting us use his jag . comes with a loft .
you wanna pick me up then ?
in philly ?
i &apos;m taking the company plane . we can land in brookhaven .
i &apos;ll see you on the runway .
company plane ? that &apos;s fancy .
umm , it &apos;s literally a private jet .
it &apos;s so nice .
flying private makes the first class feel like coach .
it totally ruins you .
that &apos;s a high class problem to have .
okay , so he &apos;s charming , handsome and he adores you .
i &apos;m not seeing a downside .
yeah , me neither .
what ?
so how come you &apos;ve been engaged for almost a year
but you haven &apos;t set a wedding date ?
well , i think i &apos;m finally ready to do that .
i told spencer it was okay if she and caleb got together .
wait , what ? back up .
yeah , she likes him like that .
and does he like her like that ?
she &apos;s spencer . what &apos;s not to like ?
you &apos;re really okay with that ?
you know what ?
ever since i &apos;ve been back here , all i &apos;ve done is spin and twirl .
and with jordan , i don &apos;t spin and i don &apos;t twirl .
he keeps me grounded and i really like how that feels .
so when &apos;s the wedding ?
well , i &apos;ve been honest with him about everything in my life
but the other night , i lied to him
about sneaking out of the room to erase that tape .
sorry that we asked you to do that .
i &apos;m gonna tell my mom what happened and then ..
... i &apos;ll tell jordan and if he still wants to marry me
then i &apos;m ready .
艾瑞亚
it &apos;s aria .
thanks .
so you &apos;re really doing this all by yourself ?
yvonne &apos;s been helping .
please , i &apos;ve banged my thumb more times than i &apos;ve hit the nails .
hey , caleb .
hey , how are you ?
i &apos;m with you , by the way .
really ?
yeah , i mean , i can jack a mainframe
with a screwdriver , but you give me power tools
i am the dumbest guy in the room .
when my eyes see a power saw
my mind sees a finger with no hands .
yeah , and a chainsaw takes me straight to no arms .
how about a wood chipper ?
fargo !
fargo !
and i see mulch .
that &apos;s because you don &apos;t watch tv
or go to the movies with me .
that &apos;s not entirely true .
we stream .
yes .
it &apos;s embarrassing , but we &apos;ve been binging on &quot; the tonight show . &quot;
why is it embarrassing ?
fallon is hilarious .
what ?
yeah , you explain it .
if i &apos;m late for this prep meeting my mom &apos;s gonna kill me .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow at the town hall .
yeah , i &apos;ve heard you &apos;ve joined the hastings &apos; campaign .
yep .
what ? you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re , you &apos;re working for veronica .
i found out this morning .
yeah , she is kind of a tough lady to say no to .
well , i look forward to finally meeting spencer .
bye ! bye !
wow , when i &apos;m falling for a girl , i , uh
usually cook her a meal .
you are building her a house .
so how about you ? you , uh ..
you cooking for anyone ?
does that have to do with hanna ?
you &apos;re still holding on to that ?
uh , actually i connected with someone
a few years ago .
the timing wasn &apos;t right and it was just ..
it @-@ it felt really complicated .
it still is pretty complicated .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
for someone who &apos;s a straight shooter
you &apos;re really talking in circles .
it &apos;s spencer .
we @-@ we &apos;ve just been spending a lot of time together
as @-@ as friends and ..
look , if @-@ if you &apos;re not okay with this , just say the word .
how does she feel about it ?
i think the same .
well , if it &apos;s what you both want , then it &apos;s not complicated .
well , i guess we &apos;ll see how it goes .
you wanna put me to work ?
i mean , i @-@ i suck at power tools
but i can probably pound a few nails .
no , i gotta go . i &apos;m meeting yvonne &apos;s parents for lunch .
so i should probably go change .
okay , well , thanks for the beer .
okay .
anytime .
i called his landline , i called his cell phone
i even called his little brother .
it &apos;s not like ezra to just walk out on me like this .
but sabrina said it kind of is like him now .
aria , where &apos;s your off switch ? you &apos;re gonna blow a circuit .
no . this is just level two . do you wanna see level three ?
man , i miss yoga class . i miss liam . i miss boston .
i miss sanity , emily .
okay , ujjayi breath , aria . just breathe .
better now ?
no .
i need you to keep sabrina busy
while i get the key to ezra &apos;s .
aria , i like her . i don &apos;t wanna lie to sabrina .
okay , fine , so just go , go buy her a cup of coffee .
you just said that you like her , so it shouldn &apos;t be that hard
to make a friendly conversation . there &apos;s no lying in that .
okay , then we &apos;re deceiving her .
emily , i &apos;m sorry . i really am .
but i need to see if that 9 iron is missing from ezra &apos;s clubs .
aria , i &apos;m trying to get my life together , okay ?
i wanna do the right thing , not move two steps back .
i understand that , but if ezra killed charlotte ...
breaking and entering , it &apos;s a crime .
we &apos;re not stealing anything .
okay , fine .
but what do we do if ezra did kill charlotte ?
do we text a photo of him to our new cyber bully sara harvey ?
no , but at least we &apos;ll know what we &apos;re up against .
候选人菲利普
伊冯 · 菲利普
九月二十五出生
hey , honey . i didn &apos;t know you were coming .
i was just headed out to the hotel to meet with spencer .
this town hall is turning out to be
quite a nice little event for us .
i erased the security footage from the hotel
the night charlotte was murdered .
oh , hanna .
we had nothing to do with what happened to her
but ... now it looks like we could have .
okay , so you don &apos;t have a tv ,
you don &apos;t have a cell phone and you don &apos;t have a computer ?
not even a facebook account .
sorry , but twitter is the new facebook
and now snapchat &apos;s the new twitter
but periscope might be the new snapchat .
this is why i stay unplugged .
umm , so what prompted your social media blackout ?
when i got sick , i realized that someday i will disappear .
but while i &apos;m still here , i want people to see me
the actual me , not the me on some web page .
so does that work ? do people see the real you ?
well , you &apos;re here having coffee with me .
you didn &apos;t text , you didn &apos;t send an e @-@ mail .
sabrina , i have to tell you something .
you make a perfect cappuccino .
do you wanna live dangerously and have one more ?
i &apos;ll step out on the ledge with you .
hanna , why couldn &apos;t you have just left it alone ?
i screwed up .
i know that . but i did it for aria .
you &apos;re not in high school anymore .
you don &apos;t owe them anything .
but they &apos;re still my friends .
and what &apos;s the big deal ? no evidence , no crime , right ?
the security company we use backs up all of our tapes
to a hard drive that they store at some place called the farm .
if the police get a hold of that drive
they &apos;ll see that aria left the hotel
and they &apos;ll know that you &apos;re the one who erased the footage .
can we go to the farm ? can we get it before they do ?
no , hanna . we can &apos;t .
ezra ?
five , six , seven ..
hey , gil .
hey .
look , uh , ashley &apos;s running late
but we can still walk through the event .
so you and yvonne are gonna be sitting here .
we &apos;re expecting a decent turnout
so we &apos;re gonna get some extra chairs .
the event &apos;s gonna have an informal feel .
hopefully sparking , uh , audience participation .
possibly a lively impromptu debate between you and yvonne .
i &apos;m sorry . a debate ?
only if it comes naturally .
now you might get a question on lafeyette .
it &apos;s okay . answer naturally .
just do not pretend to know something that you don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s how you wind up a viral video . okay ?
spencer ?
yeah . it &apos;s great .
great . excuse me .
uh , no , no , no . no , no . chair goes over there .
ezra , hi , it &apos;s stephanie from habitat .
i &apos;m back in the states . let &apos;s grab a coffee .
ezra .
dad ?
i have to talk to you about ...
well , about what you think you saw that night .
this was amazing , but i &apos;m ... i &apos;m usually not terrified ,
but these planes were so much smaller--
em , em , can i borrow you ?
yeah , i &apos;m just in the middle of a conversation right .
it &apos;s urgent .
are you okay ?
yeah .
just need to talk to my friend , that &apos;s all .
uh , so rain check on the rest of your haiti adventure ?
yeah , sorry about all this .
i used to mellow out with weed . just saying .
thanks .
okay , so what &apos;d you find ?
em , i @-@ i think my dad might have had something
to do with charlotte &apos;s murder .
i &apos;m sorry , jordan .
more about lying to you than erasing that tape .
i totally get it if you don &apos;t wanna marry me .
you actually think i &apos;d let something like this
come between us ?
yes , you screwed up , but ...
you &apos;re protecting a friend .
and that is one of the many things i love about you .
you &apos;re the most loyal person i &apos;ve ever met .
that &apos;s why i wanna spend the rest of my life with you .
blow .
uh , do you seriously want a wife
that you might have to visit behind six inches of glass ?
you &apos;re not hannibal , hanna .
people screw up , that &apos;s why lawyers have jobs .
we can get ahead of this .
but you &apos;re gonna have to be honest about everything
from now on , okay ?
okay . i &apos;m gonna call my dad .
i &apos;m sure he has some connections in philly .
do you really have to tell pappy ?
hanna , my family loves you . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
hey , dad , it &apos;s me.&apos;
yeah , good . umm , uh , i &apos;ve got a quick favor to ask .
i got another text too .
what &apos;d yours say ?
why are you whispering ?
because jordan &apos;s here .
well , did you tell him about it ?
because i really wanna tell caleb .
because he &apos;s caleb or ... because you guys are ...
you know what , hanna .
look , if you &apos;re really not okay with this--
wow , that was fast .
it &apos;s never gonna happen again , okay ?
i swear it .
you know what , that was just a knee @-@ jerk reaction .
it &apos;s fine , spencer , really .
i told jordan i erased the tape .
but i &apos;m afraid to tell him about that text .
i mean , this person threatened to blow us up .
my @-@ my brain is telling me to be honest , but ...
my ptsd is telling me to shut the hell up .
let me get caleb on this .
maybe he can shut this down
and then you can tell jordan everything .
okay . do it , spencer .
there &apos;s something that you need to see .
caleb &apos;s making progress .
he says that the signal &apos;s bouncing
through several proxy servers
but he &apos;s been able to spoof the ip address
and backtrace it to an encrypted connection .
what does that mean ?
i &apos;m not entirely sure .
but he does think that he &apos;s zeroing in
on the location of the source .
okay , let &apos;s say it &apos;s coming from the radley ,
can he narrow it down to the room ?
he doesn &apos;t really have to
i mean , if we &apos;re right about sara
she &apos;s the only person who &apos;s staying at the radley
who spent two years in charlotte &apos;s school for stalkers .
umm , can you just call me back after you talk to aria &apos;s dad ?
yeah .
hi . congratulations on the engagement .
oh , my gosh , it &apos;s so good to see you ..
spencer , hi . i &apos;m yvonne .
oh , sorry , we &apos;re a family of huggers .
and toby &apos;s told me so much about you .
yeah , you &apos;re an impressive woman yourself .
top of your class , double major at smith . wow .
so they gave you a packet on me too ?
yeah . sorry , i had to read that .
well , me too .
dc must be missing its brightest young lobbyist .
you know as well as i do that a campaign is won or lost
in the last three weeks , so ..
... i &apos;m not gonna get another vacation day
for the next three years of my life , but i thought
it was important for me to be here for my mom .
yeah , i &apos;ve heard you &apos;re not a fan of rosewood .
i , uh , i told yvonne that
i was green acres and you were park avenue .
后者的女主角也有个厉害的姐姐
green acres ?
he &apos;s just kidding . we watch a lot of retro tv .
oh , god , i &apos;m getting a ticket . sorry .
oh , yeah , fine .
so you saw the ring earlier ?
yeah , i mean , i @-@ i wasn &apos;t trying to be
a crazy ex @-@ girlfriend stalker .
i just , i was there .
it &apos;s a small town . we &apos;re gonna run into each other .
so you didn &apos;t propose ?
officer toby , can you help me out with this ?
nice meeting you , spencer .
yeah , i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
he &apos;s not here .
but his car &apos;s parked right outside .
hello .
dad ... i need to talk to you .
it &apos;s not a good time , aria . i &apos;m in a meeting .
this can &apos;t wait .
i &apos;m sorry , i @-@ i really have to go .
i &apos;ll call you later . i love you .
he hung up on me .
i think she knows .
something &apos;s really wrong .
where are you going with this ?
you went to see her ?
yes , byron . i did .
why on earth would you go see her ?
i ... enough , okay ? please .
she kidnapped and tortured our daughter .
i went to visit her today to hear charlotte &apos;s story .
after i asked you not to go .
she did terrible things , byron . terrible .
and i wanted to know why . i needed to know why .
okay . why did she do it ?
they put her in that horrible place when she was just a child .
and they never came back to get her .
i mean , can you even imagine ?
i don &apos;t want to imagine , okay ? i don &apos;t need to know why .
i just need to know that she &apos;s gonna stay locked away
and never hurt aria again .
charlotte &apos;s doctors say she &apos;s improving .
that she &apos;s rebalancing after all the years of neglect .
wait . are you saying that they may let her out ?
that &apos;s a decision for the court .
well , i &apos;m not interested in the court .
charlotte dilaurentis will walk the streets of rosewood
over my dead body .
i &apos;m calling him back .
wait .
where does your dad keep his golf clubs ?
in his car .
wait , i @-@ i used to keep an extra set of keys somewhere .
em ?
i forgot to put this back .
the good news is you didn &apos;t kill charlotte .
but you faked an alibi and you tampered with evidence
in a murder investigation .
those are serious offenses .
i &apos;m screwed , aren &apos;t i ?
only if they can prove you did it .
but i did do it .
i &apos;m the only person you &apos;re gonna tell that to .
i &apos;m very good at my job , hanna , but i can &apos;t protect you
unless you tell me everything you know .
there can &apos;t be any surprises when they &apos;re questioning us .
hanna , that &apos;s it , right ?
you &apos;ve told us everything ?
yeah . you know everything i know .
you and yvonne going camping ?
she &apos;s got a lot on her plate right now .
like you .
oh , so you &apos;re pulling a toby .
spence , we &apos;re not an us anymore .
you don &apos;t get to weigh in on my life .
i just thought that we found a way to be friends .
honestly ..
it was a lot easier being your friend
when you lived in d.c.
toby , you know that i can &apos;t go anywhere right now , okay ?
the cops are asking us a hundred questions and ..
i am really helping my mom with this campaign .
i get it , spence .
why is it so easy to fall back into old habits ?
they &apos;re hard to give up .
that &apos;s what makes them habits .
i &apos;m sorry , toby .
don &apos;t apologize . nobody did anything wrong .
well , are you at least gonna stay for tomorrow &apos;s event ?
i &apos;m sure yvonne &apos;s counting on you .
i &apos;ll be there .
you got right about this intersection
why was it so easy to track down that signal ?
and also why build a firewall if it &apos;s so easy to break down ?
i was just hoping you were gonna tell me
all these texts were coming from the radley .
hmm , so we could break into sara &apos;s room
and kick her ass together ?
you know what they say .
the couple that kicks ass together ..
that was an attempt at a non @-@ sarcastic joke .
didn &apos;t , didn &apos;t really make it .
i actually , i wanted to ask you something .
already ?
why did you delete that text about toby ?
you saw it ?
spencer , i &apos;m a professional . it &apos;s kind of what i do .
i don &apos;t know , i just ..
this was new and i didn &apos;t want it to get complicated .
i just wanted things to stay new and easy .
okay .
i get that .
hey , emily .
i didn &apos;t wanna think that &apos;s what happened ..
no , no , no . i ...
we were just trying to help ezra .
you and his ex @-@ girlfriend aria ?
but it &apos;s not what it looks like .
there &apos;s gonna be a lock on that box tomorrow .
you don &apos;t have to do that . we won &apos;t--
and i actually thought you cared about what i had to say .
i did . i do--
life is short , emily .
save your lies for someone who has time to hear them .
sabrina , you don &apos;t have to do that .
remember to use as few words as possible
when answering his questions .
yes , no and i don &apos;t recall .
that &apos;s all that needs to be said .
he &apos;s gonna know i &apos;m lying .
it doesn &apos;t matter if he can &apos;t prove it .
it &apos;s okay , you &apos;re not in this alone .
hanna , you &apos;re free to go . at least for now .
wait . why ? what happened ?
the security company lost the radley backup drive .
they lost it ?
you didn &apos;t do that , did you ?
no .
let &apos;s get out of here .
no lock .
而是隐藏在光天化日之下
it &apos;s happening again ... isn &apos;t it ?
four , five , six , seven , eight , ni ..
all my friends turn out for national elections
but most of us don &apos;t even know
when our local elections are held .
or really who our local representatives are .
until my mom got involved in the campaign , i didn &apos;t .
is young voter turnout low because we don &apos;t care to ask ?
or is it because we &apos;re confused and we &apos;re skeptical ?
a lot of politicians came to power
on the backs of rich donors .
they like it when you &apos;re confused and cynical .
yvonne &apos;s right .
for them , the less you know , the less you care .
so they get to make a lot of the big decisions for you .
but we do have access to information
and we wanna help you find it .
we &apos;re on opposite sides of this campaign
but on this issue , we stand together .
if you don &apos;t vote , you don &apos;t have a voice .
are you okay with opening this up to questions ?
absolutely , spencer .
if you guys have any questions
we &apos;d be really happy to answer them .
yeah ?
hanna , your mom just got into the elevator .
it &apos;s a go ?
we need to find out if ezra &apos;s hiding out with my dad .
she &apos;s logged out . i don &apos;t know her password .
not really my department .
hanna can &apos;t figure out her mom &apos;s password .
umm , okay , what was the name of your first pet ?
guppy .
you named a guppy guppy ?
i was two .

you saw her that night at radley .
sara wasn &apos;t just wearing that red coat , she was rocking it .

that everything she told that judge was a lie .
sara wasn &apos;t forced to play the game . she wanted to .
maybe you &apos;re right , but there &apos;s someone else
who &apos;s seeking justice for charlotte .

we &apos;ve to force ourselves to remember
that we &apos;re not the people that we once we were .
