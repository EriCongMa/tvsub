Mr. & Mrs. Anderson
Thank you.
See you soon.
You scared me there.
Can I hitch a ride?
Look, I'm just trying to get out of the cold, you know?
Uh...yeah. I'm--I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Wh-where did you say you were headed?
Anywhere but here.
Listen, my wife and I are staying at a motel up the street
and there's a bus stop out front.
That's about as far as I can take you.
Deal.
Ok. Get in.
My name is Alan, by the way.
Maya.
Where you from?
California.
Oh. You're a long way from home.
How long you been back there?
A couple hours.
Don't you have anybody you can call?
No.
It's just me.
Well, here we are.
It's not much, but...
Hope it helps.
Thank you.
Sure.
Saw the lights pull up.
I was hoping it was you.
I was starting to get worried.
It took a little longer than expected.
Who is this?
Maya. Gave her a lift from the gas station.
She's gonna catch the bus.
Oh, there's another storm coming.
Who knows how long that'll take?
Oh, you poor thing. You're shivering.
You have to come inside.
We can't let her stay out here. She'll freeze to death.
How does a nice warm shower sound?
It sounds amazing.
Come on with me, sweetheart.
Let me help you with this.
I've got it.
I am crazy about Sam. I like him, like him, like him,
but I just--I wish he was more like out-of-the-box
take charge kind of guy.
Ok, well, what do you mean by "take charge"?
Ok. Valentine's Day. I planned everything,
from dinner to dessert,
and by dessert, I mean me.
And I texted him to tell him about it and he wrote back,
"Sounds great."
Octopus emoticon.
I'm not quite sure I know what that means,
but I guess it's kind of sweet.
What's wrong with that?
Not you, too.
Ok, baby girl,
did you tell him about this?
Did I tell him...
I wanted him to take charge?
Not really.
Not at all.
Ok. Let me let you in on a little secret.
Guys, we don't do well with subtle clues. Ok?
You gotta be direct, straight up.
Just tell him exactly what you want.
I learn something from you every day.
Ok, what about you? Spill it.
What are you doing for Valentine's Day?
I was thinking about a little candlelit dinner at le Donkle's
overlooking the Potomac.
Ohh...that is romantic.
Look at us. We're all grown up. We're like...
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.
And Savannah and Sam.
Oh, can Sam be Jennifer Garner?
JJ?
JJ.
JJ.
JJ! You're back.
And ready to get to work.
How you feeling?
I'm--I'm fine.
Don't get me wrong, I love my boys to death,
but I was starting to get a little stir crazy.
Well, let's do this.
Yes.
Do you want some tea?
Welcome back.
You sure two weeks is enough time?
Oh, I'm fine. And, yes,
Will made sure I got clearance from two doctors.
Glad you're ok. We should get started.
Yes, sir.
Pittsburgh field office has reported two murders
in the past 48 hours.
Both of them were strangled,
then stripped down to their underwear
and then dumped off of a highway.
Have we I.D.'d the victims?
No, not yet.
The guy has a lot of rage.
He's using some kind of ligature,
maybe a strap?
It looks like he's choking them intermittently,
allowing them to breathe only when he permits it.
But the M.E. report says neither was sexually assaulted.
That's odd given the fact that 80% of crimes against women
involve some sort of sexual component.
Well, it's the choking that gets him off.
Some form of erotic asphyxiation filtered through
a psychopath's need for power and control.
Ok, what is this? Are they wrapped in shower curtains?
Strangely, yes. Which is why I'm checking
with a number of manufacturers
to see where these were distributed from.
The M.O. says sexual sadist,
but the curtain reads as remorse.
Sexual sadists don't feel remorse.
Maybe it's his shame?
Or maybe he's impotent.
He doesn't rape because he can't.
And the embarrassment of not being able to perform
manifests in him wrapping up his victims.
He doesn't want to look at them after he kills them.
Which points to either symbolic
or a literal emasculation.
We need to find out.
Wheels up in 30.
Ok, your homework was to dig deep
and rediscover what sparks your passion.
How's that been going?
Fine, once he...
finds the time.
Oh, here we go.
I didn't say it was your fault, ok?
I'm just--this is what I'm talking about.
Look, you two have already tried separation,
so the next step is divorce.
But since you're here,
I'm assuming you want to save this marriage.
So I'll ask again,
how have the last couple of nights been?
Fine.
A start.
This is never going to work
unless you start expressing your feelings.
Oh, right, right.
The process.
Ok. For the next couple of days
I'd like to increase your sessions.
The focus should be about getting back to the basics of being a couple.
I want you guys to be more spontaneous.
Go out and enjoy a night on the town.
Last night we did something kind of spur of the moment.
And what was that?
We checked into a motel.
Where's Alan?
Sounds romantic.
There was a spark or two.
It was like our first time all over again.
I get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about it.
Now we're finally getting somewhere.
You gotta trust the process.
Let's build on this.
Any plans of doing it again?
Definitely.
Absolutely.
Author Jennifer Smith wrote,
"Marriage is a mosaic you build with your spouse,
millions of tiny moments that create your love story."
This guy's definitely mobile.
We might be looking at a long-distance trucker.
Garcia already checked into it.
She didn't find any major routes in or around the dump sites.
Speaking of dump sites, our most recent victim
was found 50 miles from where she was last seen.
It looks like security cameras picked her up at a gas station
but never saw who she left with.
Maybe that's where he found her.
It's the perfect hunting ground.
It fits the witness' statements.
According to the cashier, the victim had been there
for several hours asking customers for a ride.
Well, she lived locally.
She could have made it home in time.
Instead, she waited.
She must have been headed some distance.
She could be from anywhere.
Maybe that's why the unsub chose her.
He doesn't just pick victims of opportunity.
He targets women who won't be missed.
Good news, crime-fighters.
I tracked the shower curtains this creep
has been using to burrito his victims.
Turns out they're commercial grade,
sold in bulk to a bunch of economy motels,
a list of which I just sent you.
It makes sense.
It's a secure secondary location.
Either he doesn't want to draw attention to his home
or someone is living with him.
Rossi, you and Morgan go to the M.E.
JJ and Reid, go through Garcia's list of motels.
Blake and I will go to the field office
and cover victimology with Agent West.
Local police are canvassing restaurants and gas stations
urging female hitchhikers to be on high alert.
It won't completely deter the unsub,
but hopefully it will limit his available victim pool.
Where are we on identifying the victims?
Nothing yet. You guys can work in here.
Thanks.
We should see if there are any unsolved murders
that match this unsub's M.O.
The transient nature of the victimology
suggests there may be bodies we haven't discovered yet.
I'll have my guys get right on it.
Thank you.
These women were just looking for a ride.
They never saw the attack coming.
25 an hour, 2-hour minimum.
Yeah, we'd just like to ask you a couple questions.
We've been canvassing several motels in the area.
It's possible a murder's been committed in one of the rooms.
I haven't seen or heard anything.
Do you mind if we take a peek at your guest log
or surveillance footage?
We don't have cameras.
We're a cash only, no questions asked type of establishment.
Would you mind taking a look at these?
Do you recognize anyone?
Never seen them before.
This might sound strange, but are any of your rooms
missing a shower curtain?
I noticed it wasn't there this morning.
The room was totally trashed.
Did a real number on the toilet.
Got someone coming out to take a look later on today.
Did you try plunging it?
Do I look like a plumber?
You mind if we take a look?
Knock yourself out.
Come on, you gotta put your back into it, Spence.
Where's Morgan when you need him?
Look at this.
It doesn't make sense.
The unsub doesn't have sex with his victims.
Then why did he need the condom?
Well, it takes impotence off the table.
He clearly had intercourse with someone
after he committed the murder.
So, he doesn't rape her.
He has sex with someone else in the room.
A lover?
Who's also his partner in crime.
We're looking for a team.
C.O.D.'s pretty straightforward.
They died of asphyxiation as a result of ligature strangulation.
Leather fibers in the cuts
makes me think he used some sort of belt.
There's no defensive wounds.
Her larynx was completely crushed.
Hey, Rossi, take a look at her fingernails.
For a woman who lives on the streets, she appears well-groomed.
Yeah, it was the same with both victims.
I'd say they bathed shortly before the attacks occurred.
Between this and the shower curtain,
cleanliness is important to them.
That could be part of their ruse.
They promise shelter and a warm shower.
Which would be a perfect opportunity
to carry out a sexual assault, but they don't.
Instead, they allow their victims to get partially dressed
in their underwear before they kill them.
Why?
Because it's not about sex with the victims.
It's about sex with each other.
But if we're dealing with two men who are sadists,
they would leave the woman naked to humiliate her.
A female partner might not.
So then we're looking at a male and a female
who are most likely in some sort of romantic relationship.
And they're using murder as their foreplay.
You married?
Actually divorced.
Why?
I just find it amusing we're paying you for advice
on something you failed.
Well, there's a lesson in everything.
My marriage taught me patience and understanding,
which I try to pass on to my clients.
Is that what you tell yourself
when you go home to an empty bed at night?
Sorry I'm late.
Hey, sweetie.
Oh, traffic was a nightmare.
No problem.
Here's a question for you.
What's your favorite flower?
Uh...pink roses.
And when was the last time he bought you some?
Oh, God, it's gotta be years ago.
When did I become the bad guy here?
Calm down.
No, she's clearly picking sides.
See, there's that temper again.
I'm actually proposing that you take charge,
starting with the pink roses.
Think you can handle that?
For years you've been saying we don't dance enough.
Come on.
If you were listening,
you'd know I was talking about the tango,
not ballroom.
Just tonight, for just one night,
can we not do this?
Just give it a chance.
I knew you wanted to smile.
Where did you learn how to do that?
I'm gonna show you.
I am a natural.
Ohh, I love that cologne on you.
Why can't it always be like this?
I'm starting to realize
that change doesn't have to be a bad thing.
Are you serious?
Pretty. I'm listening.
I'm tired of following your script.
I want to take the lead tonight.
I'll pick a good one.
All right.
Were you serious?
Sweetie,
tonight, it's all about you, it's all about you.
*Feel like makin' love*
*I feel like makin' Love*
*I feel like makin' love to you*
Take a look at this.
You guys were right.
I was able to match their M.O. to 10 other strangulation murders.
We were only able to identify 4.
They've been at it since 1994.
Looks like they stopped in 2010
and remained dormant up until now.
Something had to prevent them from killing.
Maybe one was incarcerated.
I'll start pulling prison records,
see if I can't get a match.
These two have been in a relationship
a lot longer than we thought.
But even if they broke up, to come back together
and resume killing after a 4-year hiatus is rare.
Love is strange.
It'll make you do the craziest things.
Guys,
what if they're married?
Let me help you with your coat.
Your wife mentioned you two
were looking to have a good time tonight.
Ah, she did, did she?
Isn't he perfect, honey?
Hmm. Sweetheart, like I said,
tonight's all about you.
Well, before we get started,
you might want to clean up.
Yeah, sure.
Where's your husband?
He stepped out for a sec.
I hope he doesn't mind us getting started without him.
Actually, I do mind.
I told you I'd pick a good one.
Huh. This is a first for them.
Aside from gender, the M.O. is the same.
Something in their dynamic must have changed.
A male victim most likely caters
to the female unsub's desires.
They haven't displayed that behavior before.
Up until now, it appears it's been the male picking the victims.
Which typically indicates a dominant/submissive relationship.
It looks as though her psychopathology could be evolving.
Ok, we need to look at this from a marriage perspective.
Compromise is the key to any long-term relationship's success.
What if this murder was their way of sharing responsibility?
He let the woman choose the victim. That could be problematic.
Now that she's been given control,
she might not want to let it go.
Dancing.
I'm impressed.
How did all that romance make you feel?
Spoiled.
The roses.
The dancing.
He gave up a lot to make last night very special.
Yeah, I guess I'm starting to realize
that it can't always be about me.
Compromise is important.
I'm glad you're starting to understand that.
I gotta say, you both are making great progress.
I think I speak for both of us when I say
we'd love to make this part of our regular routine again.
We believe we're looking for a married couple,
to whom we can attribute at least 13 deaths since 1994.
He's a sexual sadist, and she's a scopophiliac,
which is Greek for "love of looking,"
meaning that she gets off on watching her husband kill.
Like Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo,
who raped, tortured and killed at least 19 people,
this couple's homicidal tendencies
most likely surfaced once they met.
It's possible
that the use of a shower curtain is a sign of remorse
on the part of the female unsub.
Up until now, all the victims were females,
so it's possible that the change in victimology
could be the husband's way of subjugating his own needs
for his wife's happiness.
But a sexual sadist doesn't typically subjugate.
We think he could have committed crimes on the side
that have gotten him arrested.
But wouldn't we have the bodies to prove that?
Yes. Which is why we need to take another look
at all strangulations within the geographical profile
that occurred during the gap years.
Without his female partner's influence,
the male's independent M.O. should present differently.
Learning the nature of how that differs
from their team dynamic
will be the key to driving a wedge between their partnership.
In the meantime, all transients are at risk.
Now that the wife has gotten a taste of control,
she'll crave that feeling again.
Yeah!
And if the husband sublimated his needs with the last kill,
his desire to fulfill his own will be what's driving him now.
Thank you very much.
Sweetheart!
I'm home.
You're late.
Ah. I had a few errands to run.
It took a little longer than expected.
You couldn't bother to call?
No, I couldn't, because
it would have ruined the surprise.
All that overtime--
it finally paid off.
Ok, turn around.
The minute I saw it,
I knew you had to have it.
You like it?
Good.
Well, that's what I was thinking, Paul.
It was 2010 the last time this happened.
Boy, he just came out of nowhere this time.
I mean, he was way behind,
and somehow he was able to pull it right off.
He's the guy that can do this--
Well, honey, I got a job.
But we're supposed to be going to the movies.
The movie starts in an hour.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.
Please be on time. I don't want to miss the previews.
Sweetie, we won't. I promise.
I have a 1989 strangulation victim
dumped 10 miles from where the first body was found,
only she was raped and stabbed.
His comfort zone. Could be our unsub.
Well, I've got two more, '01 and '03,
except these took place in Clifford, Delaware.
The M.O.'s an exact match.
I got another one here from 2013,
Scottsdale, Maryland.
He was smart enough to cross state lines.
The Crestview Rapist was operating during that time.
The male unsub never went dormant.
Only the female did.
So when this guy kills without his wife,
his signature changes to stabbing
and sexual assault.
Well, stabbing is indicative of rage,
and it's most likely towards women.
And the sexual assault is his way
of establishing dominance over them.
Maybe their marriage isn't as solid as we think.
Clearly he has issues that he's working out
when the wife isn't around.
Well, if she emasculates her husband at home,
that could be the reason why she now needs
to have control over the murders.
Hey, guys, we have a survivor.
Hannah Franklin, a 23-year-old waitress
who was attacked on her way home from work back in 2008.
How long is this gonna take?
I'm already late for work.
I know this is something you'd like to forget.
You're damn right.
I still have nightmares.
That guy left me for dead.
Why would I want to relive that night?
Because if you do, you can stop that night
from happening to someone else.
It's not my problem.
Ok.
Unless that next victim's your daughter.
Because it will be someone's daughter, I promise you.
It was...dark.
I was on my way home from work.
And I had just cut through a parking lot...
It's ok.
Take your time.
I was looking down at my phone.
And that's when he pulled me into the alley.
Ok, look at me.
Look at me.
I need you to tell me what the alley smelled like.
I don't know. All I can smell is his cologne.
Ok, then focus on that
and let it guide you to the periphery.
Oh, no...
What do you see in the alley?
Uh, there's a dumpster.
Ok, keep going. Keep going.
No, I can't. He's-- he's on top of me.
Hannah, you're in a safe place. Ok?
I'm right here with you.
No--
What else do you see?
There's a couple on the other side of the fence.
They're getting into their car.
I'm trying to scream for help,
but his hand is covering--
Can you make out the type of car?
No.
Why not?
There's something in the way.
What?
The--the hook.
A hook? What kind of hook?
A fishing hook? An ice hook?
No, larger than that. It's attached to something big.
Like a vehicle?
There's a large metal arm.
It's a--wait, it's a tow truck.
Ok, great.
Can you make out any identifying marks?
Color? License plate number?
Uh, tan, maybe white. I'm not sure.
Ok, now focus on him.
No...
What is he wearing?
Some sort of work uniform.
It's greasy.
Ok, now, Hannah-- Hannah, this is important.
Does he have on a name patch?
Oh, God, it's about to happen!
The patch. Look at the patch, ok?
No! No!
Alan.
His name was Alan.
Ok.
Thank you.
It's Alan. Leave a message. Thanks.
Hi, it's me again. Where are you?
I've left you 3 messages.
Ok, I'm heading out the door.
Bye.
Judith Anderson! FBI!
Show us your hands!
Drop it!
Tell me what's going on. Somebody, please.
What's happening?
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
She hasn't even said a word.
Hasn't even asked where her husband is.
Because she knows the answer.
She's hiding something.
DNA results.
The condom found in the hotel room.
You're gonna want to take a look at that.
Hi, Judith. My name's Alex.
Can I get you anything to drink?
I'd like to make a phone call.
To who?
Your husband?
You're coming up on your 20th anniversary.
Congratulations.
That is a huge accomplishment.
We recovered a used condom with Alan's DNA in it.
Nothing odd about that,
except you've had a hysterectomy.
So, why use condoms if you can't conceive?
You seem to know a lot.
You tell me.
Well, you just don't strike me as the unfaithful type.
I mean, Alan, on the other hand, he's a different story.
You know nothing about my husband.
Well, actually, I know a lot.
I know your husband tested positive
for an STD back in 2010.
You two were married in 1994,
which tells me he isn't as committed to your marriage as you think.
There was a point in time when both of us
were unfaithful in our marriage.
When I found out he had cheated--
You thought if you retaliated it would make you feel better.
My husband and I no longer keep secrets.
I've know he's had an STD for years.
The reason we use condoms, to answer your question,
is because he insists on protecting me.
That's how much he loves me.
So she's aware of Alan's indiscretions.
He contracted the STD in 2010.
That's around the same time they went dormant.
The first body was found in 1989.
But Judith and Alan weren't married until '94.
Which means Alan was doing this on his own
5 years before they met.
And once they were married,
there was no conflict until he cheated on her.
That's probably when Judith decided she no longer
wanted to participate in the murders.
She took away what he enjoyed doing most.
So she's probably not aware
that he continued to kill without her.

Hi, it's me again. Where are you?
I've left you 3 messages.
Ok, I'm heading out the door.
Bye.
Judith Anderson! FBI!
Show us your hands!
Drop it!
Tell me what's going on. Somebody, please.
What's happening?
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be held against you
in a court of law.
I can't wait to see where this is headed.
When you discovered your husband was cheating,
you took away the one thing
that mattered most to him.
His partner in crime.
Now, how do you think he dealt with that?
Do you recognize any of these women?
How many times are we gonna go through this?
No, I do not.
And these are only a few of the victims
that he raped and murdered without you.
And which one do you think gave him the STD?
Just take a look for yourself.
His DNA is all over each of these women.
It's the killing without you that's most painful.
It's the cheating that you can't forgive.
You're married. Where's your husband?
At home.
Hmm. And you're here.
What would happen if he were to slip up?
How would you know?
A wife knows.
Which is why you know I'm telling you the truth.
My husband and I aren't perfect.
Look at these women. Look at the way
he treated them.
We're rebuilding
step by step,
He hates them
brick by brick.
because he hates you.
He loves me!
I want to talk to a lawyer.
I've gotta hand it to her. Judith's not budging.
She's committed to protecting her husband.
And their marriage.
"We're rebuilding step by step"?
Interesting choice of words.
Oh, I've heard those many times before.
Marriage counseling.
That would explain how they were able
to move through Alan's infidelity.
They were seeing a therapist.
Maybe they still are.
Green means go.
Garcia, can you check and see
if Judith and Alan have a therapist?
Checking now...
Uh, OK. Looks like they sought help
from a bunch of different people,
but for the past couple of months, anyway,
they've been seeing a Kathleen Benedict
several times a week.
Says here she specializes in something called insight therapy.
Insight therapy is also known as psychodynamic therapy.
It helps patients rediscover what motivates them
in an effort to resolve old conflicts.
And if the conflict stems from their marriage,
then helping Judith and Alan rediscover what motivates them
would reignite their compulsion to kill.
Therapy was most likely Judith's idea.
Alan doesn't seem like the type
to take guidance from a woman.
Maybe the emasculation we profiled didn't come from Judith.
Maybe it came from the therapist.
Dr. Benedict! Dr. Benedict!
Listen, sorry to call you at the last minute.
No, it's fine. Uh, what's going on?
Your message sounded urgent.
Oh. Well, Judith and I, we might be going away for a while,
so I just wanted to have one more session,
get a few things off my chest.
I'm impressed.
I know how hard therapy has been for you.
This is definitely a step in the right direction.
Yeah.
You do something different with your hair?
No.
It looks nice.
Here, let me get that for you.
Is Judith here yet?
Uh, no. She's not coming.
Just you and me.
That was Hotch. No sign of Alan at the house.
He's probably aware that we have Judith in custody.
If that's the case, he knows
it's only a matter of time before we get to him.
At this point, the guy's got nothing to lose,
which makes him more dangerous than ever.
So where is everyone?
Oh, they all took off for the long weekend.
You didn't have any plans?
Figured I'd use this time to catch up on work.
Well, I guess it's just me and you, then, huh?
Excuse me. It's my personal line.
Sure.
This is Kathleen.
Kathleen, my name is Spencer Reid.
I'm a federal agent.
Right now you need to stay calm and not react.
OK.
Is Alan Anderson there with you? Answer yes or no.
Yes, that's correct.
You need to understand that Alan is a dangerous man
and he's wanted for several murders.
Ok. I understand.
How can I help?
Do you think you can get away from there without alerting him?
Not at this time.
I'm completely booked.
Hello?
Do you think he knows?
I think you should step on the gas.
That's one thing I've learned in the 20 years I've been married,
is to listen to how a woman speaks on the phone.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You nervous?
Alan, you're not being rational right now.
We can talk about whatever's on your mind.
Or I can just show you.
No! Aah!
Somebody...
Somebody, please, please, somebody, please --
Somebody, please!
You don't know how long I've been waiting for this!
Alan, don't do this --
Shh! Shh! Try my process.
Alan Anderson, FBI!
Don't!
It's ok. Hey, you're ok.
We found Alan.
Where is he? Is he ok?
He's fine, and so is Dr. Benedict,
who he attempted to rape and kill.
Judith, your husband is going away for a long time,
but you don't have to.
If you cooperate, I will move to get your sentence reduced.
This is the last time I'm going to say this.
I will never betray him
or my marriage again.
You might want to reconsider that.
He certainly betrays you every chance he gets.
This is Gloria Walters, and the necklace she's wearing
was given to her by her fiance.
She was raped and murdered last night by your husband,
who we've also identified as the Crestview Rapist.
Can I see him?
Sweetheart.
You son of a bitch!
You're a liar. I hate you!
Get him out.
I am so sorry.
I totally could have made that recipe without cilantro.
It's my fault. I should have disclosed my food allergies.
But I could have asked.
Take a breath. The swelling's gone down.
Now what are we gonna do for our first Valentine's?
Whatever you want to do.
I don't want it to always be up to me.
I thought you liked planning things.
Yeah. But if I'm always the one planning things,
then I'm always the one planning things.
You're right.
So I'm gonna make the executive decision
that we are spending our first Valentine's day
at Patty's.
Patty's, the diner?
Yeah, Patty's the diner.
They have the best milkshakes in town.
Come on.
I like milkshakes.
You, come here.
Come here.
You know, that's why I blame you.
What, me?
Yes. One more time turns into two more times,
and now there's no way
we're getting a table on such short notice.
Girl, look at you. Can you blame me?
But as long as I'm with you,
we can go anywhere you want.
Oh, wait a minute.
Hello. What are you doing here?
Oh, my God.
Penelope?
Wow, it is so nice to finally meet you.
You, too.
Hey, you must be Sam.
Sam I am.
I've heard a lot about you.
Oh. Not guilty. Not guilty.
Look at you guys. You're literally flawless.
You're the live-action Ken and Barbie.
So where are you guys headed?
Uh, well, we actually had a change of plans.
Same here.
Is what's happening right now
what I think is happening right now?
Why, I believe so.
This is our first double date.
In that case, after you.
All right.
And after you, sir.
