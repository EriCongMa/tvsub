第三季 第十六集
&lt; i &gt; mike &apos;s plan to propose to susan ... &lt; i &gt;
these don &apos;t belong to jane .
mike delfino .
&lt; i &gt; ... was a surprise to ian . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; monique was murdered . &lt; i &gt;
there &apos;s been an accident .
&lt; i &gt; and orson ... &lt; i &gt;
don &apos;t forget your wrench .
&lt; i &gt; ... passed the blame . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; a connection was made . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; a heart was broken . and bree buried her husband rex . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; my name is rex van de kamp . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; i always hated cemeteries when i was alive . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; now that i &apos;m dead , i like &apos; em even less . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; here &apos;s where i used to live . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; a whole lot nicer , don &apos;t you think ? &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the place hasn &apos;t changed much since i left . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; as tasteful and tidy as ever . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; everything perfect ... at least , on the surface . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; my family was the same way . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; look at us . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; you &apos;d never guess how ticked off &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; we all were the day this was taken . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but that was the thing about us van de kamps . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; to really fit in , &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; you had to have a smile that gave away nothing . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; like my son andrew . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; to look at him you &apos;d never &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; know he spent six months on the streets , &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; supporting himself with panhandling and light prostitution . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; or my daughter danielle . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; does she look like the kind of girl &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; who &apos;d seduce her middle @-@ aged history teacher ? &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; i mean , they &apos;re my kids and i love &apos; em , &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but i &apos;m pretty darn relieved to be dead . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; here &apos;s the clown bree replaced me with : orson . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; i don &apos;t mind saying , &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; he &apos;s creeped me out right from the get go . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; to me , he always has the shifty look of a guy &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; who knows where the bodies are buried . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and he should know ... he buried them . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but bree thinks he &apos;s sir galahad . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the kids like him ... &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and all my friends ... now his friends . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; so it pleases me to know at least one of my old neighbors &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; sees right through the guy . &lt; i &gt;
mike , you , uh ... you just missed bree .
she &apos;s off to see her folks ,
then we &apos;re finally taking our honeymoon .
yeah , not a bad time for you to leave town , is it ?
well , i don &apos;t follow you .
i just keep thinking about that night at monique &apos;s place .
how you made sure i left with my wrench ,
the one with her blood on it .
well , it was your wrench .
why are you rehashing this ?
my ex @-@ wife confessed in her suicide note , the case is closed .
maybe it shouldn &apos;t be .
what do you think the police
would say if they knew you were there that night ?
what do you think they &apos;d
say if they knew you threw me off a roof ?
oh , mike .
we could make so much trouble for each other .
or we can forget what we think we know
and be good neighbors .
your call .
&lt; i &gt; no , orson hodge isn &apos;t exactly &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the guy i &apos;d have picked to head my family . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but i &apos;ll give him one thing ... &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; he &apos;s got the smile down cold . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; take a drive down any street in suburbia . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; know what you &apos;re gonna see ? &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; desperate women . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that &apos;s right . one unhappy housewife after another . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; each completely miserable ... &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... in her own unique way . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but i don &apos;t want to talk about them . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; no , i want to talk about their men . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and what happens to a guy &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; when that special lady in his life starts to lose it . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; like my friend carlos . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; he used to have it all .
&lt; i &gt; hot wife , tons of dough . then bam ! &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; she gets a divorce and he gets stuck with the bill . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but does he sit around &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and complain like your average hausfrau ? &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; no , sir . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; he finds creative ways to get what you can out of life . &lt; i &gt;
hey , bro , where you off to ?
the hospital called .
they found the stuff i had on me the night of the accident .
coma , murder rap . you &apos;ve had a tough year , buddy .
you know what you need ? some pampering .
tomorrow you &apos;re checking into a nice hotel .
room service , jacuzzi ... my treat .
you trying to get me out of the house ?
mike , why would i ?
ok , there &apos;s this girl .
i knew it .
dude , she &apos;s a dancer .
and if her online profile is any indication .
she &apos;s a completely freak .
we &apos;re talking serious daddy issues 。
look , i &apos;ll stay in my room . you &apos;ll never hear me
yeah , but you &apos;ll hear me .
i &apos;m kind of exuberant by nature .
when i haven &apos;t had it in a while , i do this shrieking thing .
that i means ....
ok , all right , i &apos;ll go . just stop talking .
thanks , pal !
i wouldn &apos;t want it to put a weird spin on our friendship .
too late .
&lt; i &gt; this is my friend tom . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; have you heard what he &apos;s been up to lately ? &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the silly bastard opened up his own pizza place . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; he thought that if he was his own boss , &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; he could sleep in as late as he wanted . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but the problem with that logic is that married guys ... &lt; i &gt;
it &apos;s after nine . come on , tomasino , it &apos;s time to get up .
&lt; i &gt; ... are never their own boss . &lt; i &gt;
are you as tired as i am ?
more .
but i &apos;m tougher , and i complain less .
not when you give birth . and you do that a lot .
oh , yeah ?
before i forget , you got a call from chez nous
confirming your reservation for our anniversary .
you heard that ? i wanted that to be a surprise .
we &apos;ve been going there for the last seven years .
it &apos;s not exactly a surprise .
anyway , i hope you don &apos;t mind , but i canceled .
you canceled ? why ?
honestly , i just don &apos;t feel up to going out this year .
but it &apos;s our anniversary . it &apos;s our ninth anniversary .
come on , the big nine .
that &apos;s a year longer than my mom said we would be married .
come on , we gotta party down .
i &apos;m exhausted . honestly .
all i want to do is pawn the
kids off on somebody else , take a long bath ,
and be in bed by eight .
ok .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
hold it . what about my sex ?
i always get sex on our anniversary .
we can still have sex . just try not to wake me .
&lt; i &gt; this is ian . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; don &apos;t really know the guy , &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but susan mayer seems to like him . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the other night he surprised her with a proposal . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; she said yes , but he &apos;s still a little skittish ... &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... about the competition . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but ian knows that if love is war ... &lt; i &gt;
hey . where were you off to so early this morning ?
&lt; i &gt; ... sometimes you gotta bring out the big artillery . &lt; i &gt;
i should &apos;ve had it when i proposed .
it &apos;s not very good form , i know .
ian , oh , you can &apos;t be serious !
oh , that &apos;s just too much ! it &apos;s huge !
well , we could go smaller .
no one &apos;s saying smaller !
no , that &apos;s crazy talk .
rock me .
oh ! oh , my god ! oh , it &apos;s so beautiful !
oh , oh ! ok , ok , nobody move !
i got it !
i knew i should have measured your finger .
no , it &apos;s ok . i can get it resized .
you should go to the jeweler &apos;s now .
when you get back ,
we can go and look at some places for the reception .
reception ?
yes , i was hoping we &apos;d pull this together next month .
what &apos;s the rush ? am i pregnant ?
of course not .
i just ... i just can &apos;t wait to be married to you .
are you sure ? because you seem a little anxious .
what would i have to be anxious about ?
again , sorry for the mix @-@ up . if you could sign right here .
i don &apos;t remember this . are you sure that &apos;s mine ?
it was on you the night you were admitted .
i got hit by a car . i don &apos;t remember anything about that night .
well , it looks like you were going to propose to someone .
&quot; susan , be mine forever . mike . &quot;
does that ring a bell ?
it sure does .
hey , carlos !
hi .
i have a little visitor that
i thought you might get a kick out of seeing .
remember my little boy ?
hey ! travers !
how you doing ? put her there !
i &apos;m carlos solis .
i think you came by my house one time trick @-@ or @-@ treating .
i remember . you gave me a protein bar .
right .
sorry . my wife forgot to buy candy .
hey ! is that football i hear ?
go on , check it out .
i didn &apos;t know your son was coming for a visit .
neither did i.
his , uh , father just dumped him here for four weeks
so he could jet off with his doctors without borders buddies ,
and fix cleft palates in kenya .
selfish son of a bitch .
come on , you barely ever see him . it &apos;ll be fun .
a chance to bond .
yeah , that &apos;s true .
but , um , i have this major party tonight ,
and i was wondering if , maybe ,
you could just keep an eye on him for a few hours .
sorry , i can &apos;t tonight .
oh , come on ! you love kids !
didn &apos;t you rent that chinese chick
so that you could have one of your own ?
i have a date too .
with a chick so hot i had to turn off the smoke alarms in my house .
fine .
travers , come on , let &apos;s go .
this isn &apos;t a child @-@ friendly house .
bye , travers .
wow . she &apos;s a looker .
i &apos;ll say .
hey , what time &apos;s that fund @-@ raiser ?
you got an hour .
well , then , let &apos;s have a little fun .
look what you did !
don &apos;t yell at me . i &apos;m just the passenger .
well , your driver &apos;s an idiot .
hey , it &apos;s not clyde &apos;s fault .
what man wouldn &apos;t be distracted by such beauty ?
now you &apos;re hitting on me ?
i was talking about the car .
well , good , i &apos;m glad you like it ,
because you &apos;re gonna pay to fix this .
of course . will five thousand cover it ?
five ?
sure , i guess .
rather not file an insurance claim .
my opponent could find out and try to make me look bad .
opponent ?
i guess you don &apos;t read the papers .
i &apos;m running for mayor .
my name &apos;s victor lang .
and i hope i can count on your vote .
i think i &apos;d rather vote for the other guy .
you know , the one who didn &apos;t wreck my car .
you &apos;re off your game . didn &apos;t even get a phone number .
oh , don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll be seeing her again .
how can you be so sure ?
i didn &apos;t sign the check .
what the hell are you doing ?
we need to talk .
no , we don &apos;t . get out .
please . you won &apos;t return my calls !
well , i &apos;ve been busy .
plus , my mom caught you naked on top of my friend .
just read this .
if you still don &apos;t want to talk to me ,
then i &apos;ll never bother you again .
fine , i &apos;ll read it .
but only if you get out of the car now .
now ? but the hot wax is starting .
i know .
tick @-@ tock .
you &apos;re still in there ?
how long does it take to pluck that unibrow ?
leave me alone !
danielle , i have to be at work in ten minutes .
now , can i please just come in and brush my teeth ?
i &apos;m having a really bad day , all right ? just go away !
i &apos;m gonna have a really bad day , too !
i tend not to get tipped when my breath stinks !
i &apos;m pregnant .
mike . what are you doing here ?
oh , hey , i &apos;m just selling some old jewelry .
i spoke to my manager .
there &apos;s gonna be a charge to remove the inscription ,
but we can refund you for the engagement ring .
that &apos;ll be fine .
was that the ring you bought for ... ?
yeah .
can i help you ?
uh , yeah , i have to get this sized . it &apos;s a little loose .
do you know your size ?
no .
congratulations , by the way .
ian seems great .
thanks .
i can &apos;t find my sizer .
here , try this one .
oh , no ! that ...
how &apos;s that fit ?
it &apos;s perfect .
great .
can i have it back now ?
oh . sorry .
hey , you &apos;ve got a cousin in the limo business , don &apos;t you ?
actually , i &apos;ve got a cousin .
in the &quot; limo as a front for prostitution &quot; business .
he &apos;s in jail . why do you ask ?
oh , i &apos;m just planning a big thing for my anniversary .
aren &apos;t you gonna go to chez boring like every year ?
no .
lynette &apos;s so over that , she was ready to bag the whole night .
so it got me thinking .
for nine years , it &apos;s time to shake things up .
now i &apos;m planning the greatest anniversary of all time .
check this out .
lynette &apos;s gonna open the door
to find a driver with a dozen roses and a card .
the card is gonna tell her
to go with the guy and not ask any questions .
he &apos;ll drive her out to the country .
he &apos;ll drop her off , then drive away .
just as she is starting to freak out ,
i show up in a horse @-@ drawn carriage ,
which takes us up to whitman &apos;s bluff
where we eat a catered dinner
and listen to a professional violinist .
afterwards , when we come home ,
i &apos;m sure lynette will think of a way to thank me .
you are one romantic son of a bitch .
i have my moments .
of course i &apos;m not questioning
mayor johnson &apos;s family values .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re what prompted him to put his sister &apos;s
brother @-@ in @-@ law and six of his cousins on the city payroll .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have to cut this interview short .
i have some very important business to attend to .
ms. solis , what a nice surprise .
are you here to make a contribution to my campaign ?
not exactly .
oh , no . did i forget to sign ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
let me make it up to you .
i &apos;ll take you to dinner . my treat .
it would be your treat . i &apos;m a hot date .
what &apos;s in it for me ?
well , i have , uh , &quot; an ingratiating wit , trustworthy smile , &quot;
according to the plainview herald .
yeah . check , please .
my family also owns lang enterprises .
dad &apos;s worth a few hundred mill .
well , a girl &apos;s gotta eat .
great , i &apos;ll take us to cucina .
there &apos;s no place harder to get into .
that &apos;s what you think .
mike , this is completely unnecessary .
my paying for your lawyer was a favor , it wasn &apos;t a loan .
i appreciate it . i don &apos;t like to owe anybody .
well , i @-@ i just don &apos;t want you to
have any trouble getting back on your feet .
no , it &apos;s fine . i had a windfall .
hospital gave me back an engagement ring .
i didn &apos;t know i had .
oh , really ? so you sold it ?
you should &apos;ve kept it till the right girl comes along .
well , i couldn &apos;t give this ring to just anyone .
oh , right . the ... the inscription .
how &apos;d you know it was inscribed ?
well , isn &apos;t that the custom ? i just assumed it was .
well , listen , uh , i have got to get some fresh rags .
thanks for the check . i &apos;ll see you around .
oh , you can count on it .
are you sure ?
yes .
i peed on five different sticks .
would you put that burrito away ? it &apos;s making me nauseous .
join the club .
look , i @-@ i know your parents are religious ,
but i know this clinic .
absolutely not .
so what other choice do we have ?
well , gee , you could , like , marry me !
marry you ? i can &apos;t stand you .
oh , nice way to talk to the mother of your child .
oh , god .
bathroom .
julie . hi .
your door was open .
can i come in ?
uh , what are you doing here ?
i read your letter .
i had no idea it would be so sweet .
i could really tell it came from your heart .
i &apos;m embarrassed to admit , i cried .
my aunt edie sort of tied one on last night .
anyway , i guess what i &apos;m saying is ...
ok .
ok ?
we can try again .
julie , that &apos;s great .
and i wanna talk about this ,
but i just kinda need to take care of my aunt .
can i call you tomorrow ?
sure .
we &apos;re going to have to take things slow .
because it &apos;ll be a while before i can trust you again .
i understand .
thank you , bruno.the veal was excellent .
feel like dessert ?
no , thank you . i &apos;m stuffed .
then let me propose a toast to a delightful evening ,
and to the happy accident that brought us together .
victor . you are so full of crap .
what ?
there was no accident .
i know you told your chauffeur to ram my car .
why would i do that ?
for the same reason
you &quot; forgot &quot; to sign the check .
you &apos;ve been working me
since the second we met ,
and i &apos;ve been on to you every step of the way .
what ? what &apos;s so funny ?
i just called you a manipulative jerk .
i think i underestimated you .
i also think this relationship got a lot more interesting .
there is no relationship .
this is our last date .
you didn &apos;t have any fun ?
it was ok . you know , you told a few good jokes .
you &apos;re sort of charming , you &apos;re not bad @-@ looking .
i just think i can do better .
have you not noticed , i &apos;m a catch ?
i have noticed , and i &apos;m throwing you back .
gabby , let me tell you something .
for my whole life , whenever i &apos;ve truly wanted something ,
i &apos;ve always gotten it .
and tonight , right around the time
you were calling me a manipulative jerk ,
i decided i truly want you .
so brace yourself , the chase is on .
you can chase me all you want , but trust me ,
i &apos;m way too fast for you .
bruno ... i &apos;m going to marry that girl .
can i just say something ?
you &apos;re way hotter than your profile .
so many guys say that .
what &apos;s wrong ?
my friend &apos;s kid is out there .
hey , i got an idea , let &apos;s go upstairs .
i should warn you ,
my therapist says i &apos;m sexually compulsive .
this could take hours .
whatever your issues are , we will work them out together .
it &apos;s almost eleven . what is he doing out there by himself ?
i &apos;m sure his folks know he &apos;s out there .
now relax .
i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;ll be right back . i promise .
hey , travers , what are you doing out here ?
where &apos;s your mom ?
she had to go visit a sick friend .
come on .
no way . i didn &apos;t come over here to baby @-@ sit some little brat !
he can hear you .
i don &apos;t care !
look , his mother &apos;s bound to be home soon , all right ?
then we can pick up where we left off .
forget it . i am officially no longer in the mood .
sorry . i ruined your date .
that &apos;s ok .
she was a very bad lady
who wanted to do very , very bad things to me .
night , raoul !
where the hell have you been ?
i , uh ... ducked out . just for an hour .
that &apos;s funny .
i found travers wandering the streets three hours ago .
look , he was fine when i left .
i just didn &apos;t know he &apos;d go outside .
yeah , you never know what an 8 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s gonna do .
that &apos;s why you supervise them .
you don &apos;t get to judge me .
you don &apos;t have a kid .
well , if i did , i &apos;d treat him a hell of a lot better than you do .
thank god he lives with his father .
i mean , come on ! what kind of mother are you ?
if you are done lecturing me , i would like my son now .
he &apos;s asleep .
come and get him in the morning when you &apos;re sober .
hey , buddy ! your mom &apos;s here for you !
i know you think i &apos;m a terrible person .
i never said that .
terrible mother , terrible person . it &apos;s the same thing .
because no matter what else she does ,
if a woman isn &apos;t a good mother ,
she &apos;s a failure , right ?
look , um , when i had travers ,
i , uh , i knew i was in over my head .
and when charles and i split ,
i gave him custody ...
... because i wanted my son to have the best life possible .
and that doesn &apos;t make me a good mother ,
but i like to think it makes me a realistic one .
hey , mom !
hey , champ !
i missed you !
i missed you , too .
guess what .
i &apos;ve got so many fun things for you to do today .
cool !
thanks for the ice cream .
my pleasure .
i &apos;ll see you , little man .
travers said he &apos;s staying a month .
yeah .
so if you ever need a babysitter , just yell .
i appreciate that .
wait for me !
no , i don &apos;t want a viola player . i asked for a violinist .
i don &apos;t even know what a viola is !
oh , it &apos;s just a big violin ?
ok , yeah , sure . ok , i &apos;ll see you at eight .
what was that ?
it &apos;s just a little surprise , ok ?
let it go .
&quot; let it go . &quot; that &apos;s cute .
start talking .
i planned a little something for our anniversary .
that is all i &apos;m gonna say .
ok . ok , ok .
if we &apos;re doing this , i need to buy you something .
what do you want ?
you don &apos;t have to buy me anything .
you didn &apos;t have to plan anything , but you did .
even though we had an agreement .
you like ties ? you &apos;re getting a tie .
what are you getting so upset about ?
i have been dragging my ass all day .
and the only thought that &apos;s kept me going is the hot bath .
and now i have to do my hair ,
and shave my legs ...
so what do you want to do , lynette ?
just tell me what you want .
i told you what i want .
hot bath , bed early .
but you chose not to listen .
well , ok , i guess i could just cancel the whole thing .
you can have your dream evening alone .
i &apos;ll get up a poker game or something
thank you .
hey , you know what ? i &apos;ve been dragging my ass all day , too .
you know what got me through it ?
the idea of doing something special with you .
happy anniversary .
all right , i &apos;m off to join your mother .
the hotel number &apos;s on the fridge in case there &apos;s a problem .
bree said her cell phone isn &apos;t getting good reception .
uh , actually , we kinda already have a problem .
i &apos;m already late for my flight .
can this wait a few weeks until we &apos;re back ?
yeah , this could wait a few weeks .
oh , good .
i mean , heck , this particular problem could wait nine months .
good lord .
how was your bath ?
oh , i couldn &apos;t relax .
i just kept replaying the fight i had with tom in my head .
well , at least your husband tries to be romantic .
every anniversary ,
gilbert bought me an appliance .
on the last one , he gave me a vacuum cleaner .
he died two weeks later . i didn &apos;t cry .
who could that be ?
here &apos;s what we &apos;re thinking .
clearly , the idea of the two of you getting married
is ridiculous .
so , what do you want me to do ?
glad you asked .
bree and i have decided that
danielle will join us on our honeymoon .
when we return ,
we &apos;ll tell our friends she &apos;s decided to study abroad .
once the baby &apos;s born
and adopted by a suitable family , she &apos;ll come home .
what about me ?
you leave .
leave ?
get out of fairview and don &apos;t tell a soul why ,
not even your aunt .
i can &apos;t do that .
why not ?
i &apos;ve got responsibilities . people are counting on me .
yeah , but you should &apos;ve thought
before impregnating my stepdaughter .
i said i &apos;m not leaving !
oh , easy there , turbo .
uh , we &apos;ll be right back .
so who exactly is counting on you , hmm ?
julie mayer , maybe ?
she gave me another chance .
i can &apos;t leave if i &apos;ve got a shot with her .
what &apos;s gonna happen
when julie finds out you knocked up my sister ?
didn &apos;t your stepdad say no one &apos;s gonna find out about that ?
ok , try this .
julie &apos;s a nice girl .
and you , well , you &apos;re a dog .
no knock . i &apos;m a dog lover , myself .
but julie deserves better .
and you know you &apos;ll just end up cheating on her .
no , i won &apos;t hurt her again .
sure you will .
not right away .
maybe you &apos;ll hold out for six months .
but by then it &apos;ll hurt her even more .
am i wrong ?
you just have to ask yourself .
if you can be the kind of guy she needs you to be .
and if you can &apos;t , walk away .
beer is on the house , guys .
drink fast , get stupid , lose money .
mike !

five cards start , two dollar ante .
good evening , gentlemen .
ian !
hey ... ian .
nice to see you , mike .
what is fish and chips doing here ?
susan asked me to include him .
said hee &apos;s always wanted to learn how to play poke .
so we &apos;re gonna give him some very expensive lessons .
be careful . he already knows how to bluff .
how &apos;s it going ?
good , good .
uh , i just wanted to tell you , i have to leave town for a while .
really ? is something wrong ?
no , no , no , it &apos;s just family stuff .
i don &apos;t know exactly when i &apos;ll be back .
it could be a while , though .
oh ... ok .
i just want you to know that it means a lot
that you were willing to give me a second chance .
you &apos;re like the only person that &apos;s ever done that .
austin , what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
uh , it &apos;s just ... i have to go .
goodbye , julie .
austin !
i &apos;ll raise you .
i &apos;m out .
another courageous move from foldilocks .
i &apos;ll call you . flush , king high .
full house , sevens and knaves .
jacks ! we call them jacks !
boy , this is your lucky room .
yes , i heard about your engagement the other night .
congratulations .
yeah , about that , ian ...
was that proposal spontaneous ,
or did you have it all planned ?
oh , it was entirely planned .
i thought it &apos;d be the ideal occasion .
oh , if it was planned , why didn &apos;t you have a ring ?
well , i thought susan might like to choose the ring herself .
ante up , boys .
so why &apos;d she pick a ring that was too big for her ?
how did you know that ?
guys , guys , guys , guys , we came here to play cards .
why are we talking about jewelry ?
sorry , tom .
but i found out i bought a ring for susan myself .
it was in my pocket
that night some son of a bitch ran me over .
tom &apos;s right . we should focus on the game .
after our talk , i called the hospital .
they said my ring got in with your wife &apos;s stuff .
so you saw it before i did ,
the same day you proposed to susan .
and your point is ?
that that &apos;s why you were in such a big hurry .
you wanted to seal the deal before i found out about the ring
and told her .
do you think i &apos;m afraid of you ?
maybe you should be .
what do you think susan would say
if she found out why your proposal was so spontaneous ?
guys , can we just play ?
i &apos;m trying .
fine . deal .
hello .
mr. scavo ?
it &apos;s lamar from the limo service .
um , i got a flat ,
so i might be late picking up you and your wife .
what are you talking about ? i canceled you .
no , you didn &apos;t .
yes , i did . i left you a message .
oh , i must have missed it .
anyway , i dropped your wife where you told me .
oh , god , when ?
about two hours ago .
guys , um , lock up when you &apos;re done !
i &apos;ll open .
i &apos;m out .
and i &apos;ll raise you .
you want a beer ?
tom &apos;s gone . let &apos;s go open up the good stuff .
well , looks like it &apos;s just you and me , if you &apos;re still in .
with this hand ? you bet i am .
i &apos;ll re @-@ raise .
and raise again .
your stack &apos;s looking kinda small .
will you take a check ?
you know i can &apos;t match that .
how about this then ?
you win , you keep the money
and you tell susan whatever you want .
if i win , you keep your mouth shut about the ring
and you leave me and susan alone .
deal .
how was the game ?
i won .
lynette , i am so sorry ! i am so sorry !
there was supposed to be a horse @-@ drawn carriage and ...
oh , good , you got the flowers .
coffee ?
yes , please .
yeah , she likes coffee , too . thanks .
i &apos;m really , really , really , really sorry ...
please stop apologizing .
i appreciate what you were trying to do .
it was a lovely thought
that went hideously , hideously , hideously wrong .
wait until the kids find out
you saw a real coyote .
hideously .
well , i learned my lesson .
never again . no more surprises .
from now on , i &apos;ll do exactly what you say .
oh , don &apos;t you dare .
what ?
i had a lot of time to think tonight .
and i realized , you were right .
we have to keep the romance going .
no matter how tired we are .
the only thing worse than just going through the motions
is not bothering to go through the motions .
so you want me to surprise you next year ?
knock yourself out .
just wait , because i will think of something even better .
oh , after this year ,
i &apos;d be happy with any date that included food and shelter .
nine years .
nine years .
and i have loved every minute of it .
me , too .
&lt; i &gt; take a drive down any street in suburbia . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; know what you &apos;re gonna see ? &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; a bunch of guys wearing the same expression . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it &apos;s a look that says , &quot; oh , crap . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; my dreams are never gonna come true . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; i &apos;ll never have a life free from scandal . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; i &apos;ll never have a son of my own . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; i &apos;ll never hold her in my arms again . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; i &apos;ll never get to tell her how i feel . &quot; &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; yeah , the suburbs are filled with &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; a lot of men who &apos;ve given up hope . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; of course , every once in a while &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; you do come across some lucky sob &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; / i &gt; whose dreams have all come true . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; you know how you spot them ? &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; they &apos;re the ones who can &apos;t stop smiling . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; don &apos;t you just hate those guys ? &lt; / i &gt;
