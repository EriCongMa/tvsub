why are you still even looking
through martha stewart living every month ?
&apos;cause we might be mentioned in it .
martha said she hadn &apos;t forgotten about us .
that &apos;s what my mother said ,
but i spent a whole day and night
in that school parking lot .
silver lining-
i still know the whole rap part to tlc &apos;s waterfalls .
well , i &apos;m still holding out hope we &apos;re in this ,
even though i &apos;ve been hurt two months in a row .
oh , god , am i in an abusive relationship

is it &apos; cause i &apos;m here ?
sophie , look , max &apos;s homemade cupcakes

oh , that &apos;s funny ,
&apos;cause i got a blurb in new york apartment life .
look . &quot; sophie &apos;s choice cleaning service--
they clean like their life depends on it . &quot;
well , that &apos;s not exactly the same .
no , &apos; cause , look , i got three plungers .
yeah , but i didn &apos;t want to brag .
that must be andy wondering
if i &apos;m coming over to have sex tonight .
could my life get any better ?
oh , my god . it could get better .
there are , like , ten cupcake orders here .
birthday , baby shower , bris .
can we do a bris ?
sure . i &apos;ll just make a little rosette foreskin
and write around the outside ,
&quot; congratulations on not terrifying women in 20 years . &quot;
hey , andy .
hi , candy .
did you see it ?
did you see the new martha stewart living ?
oh , sorry , no .
i still have to get through my glamour and modern bride .
and i had sisters , so i &apos;m allowed to know those names .
&quot; a williamsburg must @-@ have . &quot; nice .
you know i feel the same way about you .
aw , cute , but it really doesn &apos;t mean anything
unless it &apos;s in a blurb .
i couldn &apos;t wait to show this to you .
i &apos;m so glad you were here late doing inventory .
yeah , you know , it &apos;s the weirdest thing .
the only thing i can &apos;t account for
is one missing elvis pez dispenser , max .
um , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , but ...
thank you very much .
can we please get back to the blurb ?
sorry . you &apos;re right .
i should have made a bigger deal about it .
it &apos;s just i &apos;ve been a little freaked out .
we had some big drama here today .
drama in a candy store ?
did the yogurt @-@ covered craisins finally realize
how stupid they are and commit mass suicide ?
no , but seriously they pulled some bodies
out of the closed @-@ down soup kitchen across the way tonight .
so now we &apos;re completely off the blurb ?
some guys broke in .
a bunch of people got shot .
apparently , it was a drug deal gone wrong .
oh , my god . that &apos;s horrible .
i know .
why can &apos;t a drug deal ever go right ?
hey , they said it was a real bloodbath .
i want to see it !
oh , okay , so i &apos;m closing the magazine then ?
max , you can &apos;t go in there .
it &apos;s a crime scene . there &apos;s police tape .
is she magic ?
one of my mom &apos;s boyfriends used to rob electronic stores .
he took me once for my birthday .
hmm , there should be a light switch around here .
oh , my god .
oh , that &apos;s really gross .
that &apos;s the greatest thing i &apos;ve ever seen !
take a picture of me over here .
i finally have a reason to join instagram .
people are gonna be like , &quot; food , food ,
cat , food , nails , nails , murder ? &quot;
guys , i can &apos;t be in here .
i get queasy if the meat juice touches my peas .
is this your first blood splatter ?
jeez , someone &apos;s a princess .
man , they are never gonna be able to rent this place now .
i &apos;m gonna go over to my store and put blood on the walls
so max will like it more .
max , look around .
are you thinking what i &apos;m thinking ?
yup . the shooter stood here ,
and , based on the blood splatter ,
he was short and walked with a limp .
and his name was mad dog .
&apos;cause i want that to be his name .
no , max ,
you know how we &apos;ve always wanted our own shop ?
this is it .
this is max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
oh . yeah , i see that .
and we can put our red velvets over there
by the random skull fragments .
besides , i thought our shop was gonna be in manhattan .
manhattan &apos;s over .
williamsburg is the new hot area ,
and besides martha &apos;s blurb says we &apos;re a williamsburg must @-@ have ,
so we must have this space .
no , we must have the money .
i mean , this place has got to be , like , $ 4,000 a month .
was . was $ 4,000 a month .
that was the pre @-@ tragedy price .
when people die , it &apos;s a buyer &apos;s market .
you want to rent a room in that shining hotel now ,
it &apos;s , like , 50 bucks a night .
well , obviously i wanna start a business
in a place where there was a shooting spree .
and , if we go with red , it &apos;s half painted .
but where are we gonna get the money ?
this blurb is our money in the bank .
oh , yeah , that &apos;s another thing we don &apos;t have .
a bank .
there are places set up by women
specifically to support other women &apos;s small businesses .
i &apos;m talking girl @-@ on @-@ girl financing .
that &apos;s hot .
but i don &apos;t care how much money they offer us .
i &apos;m not braiding anyone &apos;s hair .
but are we ready ?
okay , yes .
this is a big leap of faith ,
but we &apos;re getting in lots of orders now thanks to the blurb .
and what &apos;s the worst thing that could happen ?
um , maybe these could be our brains .
no , not gonna happen .
we &apos;re gonna kill it .
no disrespect to any spirits
still trying to find their way into the light .
i &apos;ll figure out a place ,
and we &apos;ll go first thing in the morning .
find something business @-@ y to wear , less cleavage .
oh , these are all business .
great , i &apos;m gonna go find andy .
what is it about real estate that makes you wanna dry hump ?
max , i &apos;m so excited .
we &apos;re getting our dream .
you look like you want a hug .
i do .
good night .
&quot; max &apos;s homemade cupcakes , &quot;
you &apos;re up .
caroline , why didn &apos;t you pick up ?
they just called us early , and i don &apos;t know
what to write on the paper .
and i feel like an idiot , my boobs are suffocating ,
and the only &quot; business &quot; thing i could find was han &apos;s blazer .
it &apos;s itchy , and there &apos;s a piece of paper in the pocket
with his name on it .
why would he have that ?
&quot; max &apos;s homemade cupcakes , &quot;
time is money .
um , here .
but our appointment &apos;s not for another 20 minutes .
have a seat .
cool place .
women &apos;s small businesses .
sisters doing it for themselves .
well , i &apos;m doing it for the medical benefits .
go .
oh , now ?
before she gets here ?
um , well , i &apos;m not really much of a business person .
great way to start a business loan application .
go !
you have a minute .
okay , well , um , how much time do i have now ?
slightly less than a minute .
okay , uh , my business partner
could explain this better than me , but i &apos;ll try .
we have a cupcake business .
and we bake cupcakes in my roommate &apos;s bedroom .
i can &apos;t hear you .
you want to write it down , draw it , shape it in clay ?
i would have filled this out more ,
but that chick over there wouldn &apos;t let me cheat off her .
she &apos;s not a girl &apos;s girl , know what i mean ?
very professional .
under past loan repayment ,
you put , &quot; paid todd back all the beer money i owed . &quot;
to be fair , he was drunk all the time .
i could have just said i did .
points for honesty .
let &apos;s get you a new loan application .
just got your message .
the one time i don &apos;t come early .
speaking of that , i just had the most amazing orgasm .
i mean , we &apos;ve been having really great sex ,
but this morning , i could not get enough of his--
projected growth ratio investment analysis .
hello , caroline channing .
wharton class of &apos; 09 .
that &apos;s our business proposal .
and i would be a little embarrassed about what just happened
if i didn &apos;t know that we &apos;re all just girls here .
can we move this along ?
i got a busted toilet and a pregnant dog at home .
why didn &apos;t you tell me she was under there ?
oh , sorry , i wasn &apos;t expecting a monologue
from confessions of a call girl .
i &apos;m afraid we &apos;re gonna have to deny the loan .
why ? because she had a good orgasm ?
isn &apos;t that what the &apos; 70s was about for you gals ?
you have no business history .
and that &apos;s a requirement for us .
well , i think we &apos;re done here .
yeah . i just said that .
i thought you guys were about
supporting small women &apos;s business .
and this small woman &apos;s &quot; bidness &quot; needs support
after the pounding it took today .
max , let &apos;s go .
okay , there &apos;s a bank in new hampshire
that doesn &apos;t check anything .
and before someone else grabs our cupcake space ,
i say we get on a bus and go up there .
they won &apos;t give out their exact address ,
but i know they &apos;re in a mini mall with a white castle .
better idea .
i went to craigslist ,
clicked on &quot; etc &quot;
and found all kinds of opportunities to make some cash .
i &apos;m fighting the instinct to weep , but keep going .
at first i thought i might call pit pig .
he just wants his armpits smelled ,
but that &apos;s , like , 1,000 sniffs .
big commitment .
or there &apos;s the weirdo looking for pretty amputees ,
but that feels like a bigger commitment .
so , check it .
&quot; egg donors needed .
ten to twenty grand . &quot;
no way , i could never sell my eggs .
i mean , wouldn &apos;t you hate to think
you had a kid out there and not know it ?
i probably do .
in 2006 , i invented the four loko and robitussin smoothie .
it &apos;s pretty much a blackout year .
seriously , for the right price i &apos;d sell &apos; em all .
really ?
i mean , i know you &apos;ve always been tough .
to hear you tell it ,
you were part of an underground baby fight club .
but don &apos;t you wanna be a mom some day ?
in the history of the world ,
give me one example of a really good mother .
you &apos;re putting me on the spot .
all i can think of is hilary duff .
look , you &apos;re complicating this
with these things you call emotions .
like it or not ...
i &apos;m an egg farm .
because we don &apos;t know one single person outside of new hampshire
who can lend us that kind of money .
yoo @-@ hoo , girls , look out the window .
up here ! it &apos;s me !
oleg and i would like two cupcakes please .
i feel weird asking sophie for money .
and how do we even know she has any ?
well , she &apos;s building her dream house in poland
between a former death camp and a new w.
she &apos;s gotta be loaded .
and sophie &apos;s the kind of woman who understands our dreams .
come in .
that &apos;s exactly what i thought would be
on the other side of that door .
oleg , sweetie , we have company .
i brought you an ass pillow .
nice to see you like this outside of work , girls , no ?
no .
girls , did you see my big hanging thing ?
yeah , we kinda just saw it .
no , i &apos;m talking about my new ch @-@ andelier for my lake house .
yeah , i can totally see you drinking ch @-@ ardonnay under it .
oh , max , you are so funny .
she &apos;s a real ch @-@ aracter .
yeah , that &apos;s not a word .
okay , well , we just wanted to bring you
some more cupcakes for free , per usual ,
and perhaps talk about a possible business venture .
oh , sorry , girls .
i have two rules in life :
never drink from the same well as a gypsy
and never lend money to friends .
and , max , you are my friend .
okay , well , we were just checking , but thanks anyway .
but , sophie , just hear us out .
it &apos;s a wonderful opportunity ,
and we &apos;ll of course pay you back with interest .
okay , buh @-@ bye .
let &apos;s go . we tried it .
now it &apos;s---- time .
you are not harvesting your body for money .
what &apos;s the big deal ?
i sold two kidneys for a down payment on my house .
not true . you need at least one to live .
oh , well , they weren &apos;t mine .
well , you know what we have to do .
let &apos;s get the bok out of here .
and you &apos;re sure you &apos;re okay with selling your eggs , right ?
totally . what do i care ?
i &apos;ve got a million of &apos; em .
i &apos;m happy to lose a few . more room for beer .
lose some eggs , more room for beer .
it &apos;s crazy that &apos;s not their slogan .
so what &apos;d they ask you on the application ?
you know , income , hobbies ,
&quot; did you ever have sex in africa ? &quot;
i wish .
the closest i ever got was a dude once
put his hand up my skirt in an ethiopian restaurant .
you know , now that we &apos;re here ,
i think it &apos;s kind of wonderful that places like this exist
to help women who can &apos;t have babies have babies .
hey , you think they take points off for syphilis ?
max , i think it &apos;s really noble
what you &apos;re doing to get our dream .
this is a very special day .
how do you spell &quot; chlamydia &quot; ?
well , no &quot; k &quot; s ,
and i personally wouldn &apos;t heart the &quot; i. &quot;
oh , thanks .
and do i gotta put here if my brother touched a kid ?
max black .
thank you for your interest ,
but i &apos;m afraid we &apos;re gonna have to pass .
why ? i didn &apos;t have sex in africa .
yes , i know , that was your one plus ,
but under &quot; family history , &quot;
you put &quot; drinking &quot; and &quot; secrets . &quot;
i was being honest .
yeah , maybe too honest , because under &quot; education , &quot;
you wrote , &quot; jeopardy reruns , &quot;
and we &apos;re really looking for college graduates .
jeez , i &apos;ll take &quot; elitist &quot; for 500 , alex .

sorry , we &apos;re looking for girls
that come from ivy league schools
and have impressive family backgrounds .
maybe her eggs didn &apos;t go to wharton
and graduate at the top of their class like i did ,
but just look at her .
who wouldn &apos;t want a baby with such strength , beauty ,
and a rack so great it could breast @-@ feed itself ?
you went to wharton ?
we pay $ 20,000 for ivy league eggs .
wow , we &apos;re taking blood already ?
i guess going to wharton does put you on the fast track .
just part of the process to become a donor .
i &apos;m gonna go get some vials , and i &apos;ll be right back .
it &apos;s so cool of you to do this .
it says a lot about you .
you know what says a lot about me ?
the fact that i know she tied you off wrong .
i &apos;m happy to do it .
it &apos;s a small price to pay to make our dream come true .
i &apos;m doin &apos; this to pay down some debt .
i &apos;m real deep &apos; cause of powerball .
whoa , dude , how did you get through ?
i went to harvard .
i &apos;m like crazy @-@ good at math .
max , she &apos;s making me nervous .
close the curtain .
and frankly , i &apos;m a little resentful .
i didn &apos;t get into harvard .
are you sure you &apos;re okay with this ?
&apos;cause you seem a little jumpy .
no , i &apos;m fine .
they &apos;re just taking a little blood .
or from the looks of it ,
they &apos;re taking all of it .
there better be a nice juice and a cookie after this .
please relax . it &apos;s only eight vials .
they gotta take a lot to make sure they don &apos;t get a kid
with , like , another kid growing out of it .
max , this all just got very real .
hold my hand .
you know i don &apos;t hold hands .
oh , you lesbians are so high maintenance .
please ?
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna give away my best egg , right ?
i &apos;m not gonna give away the concert pianist
and get stuck with the guy who breaks into homes
and smells women &apos;s underwear ?
well , either way , you got a kid with a passion .
but you don &apos;t have to do this .
no , i can do this . it &apos;s for our dream .
but you don &apos;t have to do this .
i can do this . put it in .
it &apos;s already in .
i can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m not trashy , i &apos;m not some farm animal .
oh ! oh , my god !
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
i am so , so sorry !
you know what would be cute here ?
a cupcake store .
hi , max . oh , it &apos;s chilly outside .
nipples everywhere .
have a seat . i &apos;ll be right over .
oh , that &apos;s okay . i texted my order in on the way .
hey baby , i got your text .
did you get my erotic haiku ?
i did .
did you get the picture i sent of me and the dustbuster ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
oh , no , grandpa yorgish !
look .
earl framed our blurb .
he did ? that is so sweet .
what ?
i always saw it as bigger on the wall in our shop .
look , the shop is an amazing idea ,
and , if it &apos;s not that space right now ,
it &apos;ll be another .
i mean , there have to be mass murders all over brooklyn , right ?
if we &apos;re lucky .
and , even if it didn &apos;t work out ,
it &apos;s still the closest i &apos;ve ever come
to something great , and that &apos;s cool .
and someday we &apos;ll find someone crazy enough to lend us money .
i say that because , if you can convince me to believe a dream ,
you can get anyone .
pickup .
here you go , sophie . that &apos;s $ 11.25 .
oh , you take a check , right ?
this is for $ 20,000 .
oh , is it ? i thought it was for $ 20 .
oh , well . keep it .
maybe you could use it for your dream ,
or to get your legs waxed , or something .
sophie , are you serious ?
yes .
sophie , this is really , really amazing .
oh , come on . i don &apos;t need a parade .
just keep the cupcakes coming .
max , do you know what this means ?
we are going to be a williamsburg must @-@ have .
we &apos;re getting our dream .
i feel like you want a hug .
