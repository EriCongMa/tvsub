Dying changes everything.
There's the emotional fallout, sure.
But there's also the practical stuff.
Who's going to do your job?
Who's going to take care of your family?
The only good thing for you is,
you don't have to worry about it.
People you never knew will be living in your house,
working your job.
The world just keeps on going...
without you.
Steph, I need a favor.
I'll do your scut for a week--
two weeks-- and before you say no,
I just want to say that you look really pretty today.
And you're the most talented intern in our class,
and I'm in no way trying to butter you up.
So you don't say no.
No.
You don't even know what I'm asking you yet.
Yes, I do. I'm not going anywhere near Medusa for you.
I want to live so I will say it again--no.
Nothing to be scared of.
She's just an attending.
We only call her Medusa because--
Because she's a monster of mythic proportions.
What's the problem?
I have these labs for Dr. Grey.
Well, then give them to her.
I've been waiting for those for over an hour.
I had to do an admission--
Stop making excuses.
Sorry.
Stop apologizing.
Stop talking.
His lactic acid is normal. What does that tell us?
You can talk now.
That he's probably not septic,
so he's gonna be fine.
Although his white cell count is elevated
so I should probably keep an eye on that.
In fact, I will keep an eye on that so that he doesn't go--
Go to the pit and try not to kill anybody.
Impressive.
I would've expected that level of intimidation from Yang maybe.
Not you.
How is Yang, by the way? Does she like Minnesota?
She loves it.
Dr. Parker.
And that was before I realized...
Dr. Parker.
That there was a tumor in there.
I mean, we had spent, uh, three hours
trying to deal with the valve--
Dr. Parker.
Oh, Dr. Yang.
You've gotta hear about this case Dr. Thomas had--
must be what, ten years ago?
Um, I looked at the Oberman baby's scans.
Uh, I know we discussed doing a thoracotomy,
But I think a V.A.T.S. makes more sense.
Fantastic.
But let Dr. Thomas tell you about this story first.
You're not gonna believe your ears.
How about I scrub in with you
and then I can tell you the whole story?
When's your surgery?
11:00
Oh, that won't work. I have a bypass at 11:00.
Oh.
Why don't you move your surgery back
and then I can join you?
Uh, that's really not necessary.
And then you will be able to, uh, watch my 11:00.
It's a port-cabg. Have you ever seen one?
I've done one. Three in fact.
Well, then you'll appreciate my approach.
It's even better.
Well, wait a minute. Where are you going?
My ambulance isn't here yet.
I can start the story now.
The patient was 66.
Although I suppose I should start
when I first met the man.
Just wanted to let you know, we're all set for tonight.
Unless you had some questions or concerns.
I don't.
Okay. Um...
5:00
Okay.
How often should her calcium levels be monitored?
Every 12 hours.
And what's the primary cause of hypocalcemia
after parathyroid surgery?
Really?
Are you telling me not one of you knows that--
Hungry bone syndrome...
where calcium and phosphorus are rapidly deposited into the bone.
You're not supposed to be here.
Got a last-minute flight.
Couldn't pass it up.
You aren't on call tonight?
Not anymore.
I switched shifts.
What's your turnaround this time?
12 hours. And I plan to make use of every single one.
Occupied.
Mm. I don't want you to go.
Listen... I wish I could put off Hopkins
so you and I could spend more time together,
but I've already postponed them once.
Mm. I know, but it doesn't mean I have to like it.
I really hate good-byes.
Well, you'll like this one.
Okay, what did I say about the staring?
I'm fine, and even if I weren't,
staring at me wouldn't make me more fine.
I'm sorry, Dr. Torres.
Really, Avery? You too?
No, not staring. Uh, definitely not.
Excuse me.
Okay, what do we got?
Hey, you tell me.
Looks like a transverse process fracture
at L-3, L-4, but see this swelling?
I can't tell if it's unstable or not.
It's unstable for sure.
Book an O.R., we need to get in there
and relieve the pressure as soon as possible.
Wait. "We"?
As in you and me?
It's no big deal.
Actually, it is. It's...it's...
It's a very big deal.
I've been cleared for surgery for weeks.
Yeah, I know, 'cause I cleared you,
But you said you weren't ready s...
Well, now I'm saying I am.
Okay.
Again, it's no big deal.
It is a big deal.
I will be done long before 5:00.
That's not the point.
Why are you putting this pressure on yourself?
I've been practicing for weeks. I feel good.
I just can't sit around looking at the clock.
You really need to do this today?
Yeah, I do...
Especially today.
I mean, he says he's ready.
And his nerve graft seems to be ready.
So I guess today's the day he's gonna operate...
with his brand-new hand.
And it is gonna work. It's definitely gonna work.
You think it's gonna work, right?
I thought I might find you in here.
I keep thinking if I say something big enough
or...shocking enough,
He'll just... he'll open his eyes.
7 hours till 5:00.
His directive was very specific.
If, after 30 days, there are no signs of recovery,
Mark wanted to be let go.
That's all we're doing...
honoring his wish.
I know. I just...
Oh, god. It's so hot in here.
I think I'm gonna take off my shirt.
Oh, yeah. That's better.
Oh, yeah, it's so much cooler with my boobs out.
Well, if that didn't wake him, I don't know what will.
Yeah.
You always had to be the first.
You are a terrible best man.
Addison's great,
but one woman for the rest of your life?
It's not what god intended.
Especially for men who look like us.
God intended for us many, many women,
a staggering number of women.
I just hope you didn't forget the rings.
Derek... you're lucky to have me.
You will never, ever find another friend
as good as me, ever.
Hey, are you filming this?
Okay, we're not doing this, okay?
I'm not gonna be in one of your videos...
So you can put it on your creepy bookcase
with all your other creepy videos.
There's no bookcase.
And I've never done this either,
but trust me, what's about to happen,
you're gonna want to relive over and over.
One second.
The intern appy...you got your guy?
I have someone in mind.
And you really want to do this today?
Especially today.
Okay.
Grey. Hey.
I need you to take my 3:00 lap chole.
Oh, I can't. I have the intern appy.
Grey, living up to your nickname.
Nickname? I have a nickname?
They call you Medusa...
The serpent-haired monster who turns folks to stone.
Hey, this is not a bad thing.
You want to be the attending with the scary nickname.
It keeps your residents in line.
It strikes fear in their heart.
Take it from the Nazi, it's good to be feared.
You retired the Nazi.
They call you something else now.
They do?
They do.
Excuse me, Dr. Parker, quick question.
Okay, hands up, everybody.
One, two, three.
What can we do for you, Dr. Yang?
Oh, I...I didn't mean for you to stop your procedure.
You can just keep going while I talk.
We can't, actually.
We find that multitasking leads to errors in hearing
and errors in healing.
Okay. Well, Dr. Thomas invited himself onto my V.A.T.S.
This afternoon...the Oberman baby.
I was wondering if I could do the procedure on my own,
without him.
How come?
Uh, well...Dr. Thomas is a big talker and...
Oh, my gosh. That is the truth.
Dr. Thomas can chew your ear right off.
I...I tell you, once he cornered me with a story.
I was on my way to the gentlemen's room.
I hate to invoke potty humor,
but I wasn't sure I was gonna make it.
That's how long the story was.
Exactly. So...
My advice to you is, visit the ladies room
before you enter his proximity. Yes.
I will, but another solution would be
if he just didn't scrub in.
You've got a tough row to hoe there, Dr. Yang.
No doubt about it.
Thankfully, you're a tough cookie.
You're up to the task.
We salute you.
Guess what. I have a nickname.
Medusa. I'm Medusa Grey.
I had to push my flight tonight.
Okay.
It's not what you're thinking. It's not like last time
or the time before that.
My surgery got pushed. That's it.
I'm on standby for a later flight.
It's okay if you're not ready to fly.
I said I'd come. I'll be there.
Well, you won't make it by 5:00 anyway,
so why push yourself?
I will be there, Medusa.
Oh, so you did hear me?
I like it.
Snakes in the hair--hot!
Okay, bye.
Cristina's coming tonight?
She'll never make it by 5:00,
But she says she's gonna be here.
She's not gonna get on that plane, is she?
We're working on it.
Probably not.
You really doing the intern appy?
Jealous?
He's too busy just doing the interns.
Are you gonna say good-bye to your fan club before you leave?
I've been saying good-bye all day.
Gross.
They're gonna be sad to see me go.
You may have to step up, Avery. Comfort them a little.
No sloppy seconds for me, thank you.
You're a surgical fellow.
Might as well enjoy the perks.
Besides, you need to get laid.
You haven't banged anybody since Lexie.
Sorry, Mer.
I-I have...
banged people.
I'm screwed.
As long as Medusa's my attending,
I will never get to see the inside of an O.R.
Unless you're the patient.
Don't be alarmed, but Medusa's walking over here.
Depending on her mood, I may have to pretend I don't know you.
Good afternoon, everyone.
As you all probably already know, we have a tradition here.
The honor of performing your first surgery
is reserved for the intern who shows the most promise.
Dr. Wilson.
Congratulations, you're scrubbing in.
You got soda coming out your nose.
He has an unstable fracture.
I need to do a fuse in here and he--
Any numbness or tingling around the median nerve?
Not-- I'm good to go, Torres.
You did a great job.
And you'll need your I.D. Card
to access the scan rooms.
Hey.
Hey.
Hi. Uh, this is Mel Barnett.
He'll be joining us from Miami.
Peds surgery. I'm the new attending.
And you are?
I'm Derek Shepherd, uh, neuro.
Nice to meet you.
Nice meeting you.
Callie Torres, ortho.
Oh, right.
Uh, I am so sorry,
Uh, about your wife.
I mean, I heard, and, uh--
Thank you.
Okay, uh...
How about I show you the NICU?
Let's not make a big deal.
Listen...
I wish I could put them off so you and I could
spend more time together,
But I already postponed Hopkins once.
Oh, my god.
Just go--get out. Get out.
I'm sorry.
Callie?
I said get out.
Are you okay?
Get out, okay? Get out.
You're gonna thank me for this, Avery,
when you've rewatched it for the 500th time
trying to figure out how to line up your vertical mattress sutures
as perfectly as I can.
Now pan up to my face.
You see that? Not a drop of sweat.
You know why? 'cause I'm that good.
Now go get scrubbed. You're gonna finish up here.
Wait. Really?
Hurry. Before I change my mind.
And I finished the reconstruction we talked about
on the young mastectomy patient,
Uh, and the result is full Sloan.
I mean, she is gonna look a scale hotter than god intended.
Uh, and grandpa's labs came back.
Stable. Um, scarring is gonna be a problem, obviously.
But the result is pretty good considering.
And you think we can do better.
I don't know. Reconstruction?
That's pretty radical for a guy his age.
No, you're right.
We can do better.
Hey, I wish you could see the surgery I'm watching.
It is a train wreck.
So you're not gonna make it by 5:00.
Do you want to FaceTime or Skype or something?
It's kind of weird that you're not gonna be here.
Oh, look at that.
He turned a port-cabg into a sternotomy.
Why?
Why? Because this surgeon is 103.
Because everyone in this frozen tundra
is too damn polite to say,
"Hey, retire, old man,
before you kill someone with your brittle, bony hands."
I'm sorry. Would you mind taking that outside?
I'm trying to take notes.
Yeah, well, there's nothing to learn here.
He's just poking holes
in a guy's pericardium.
He'll never come off bypass.
I just wish you were gonna be here.
Owen e-mailed me today,
wanted to make sure I had people around me tonight.
I don't know why everyone is so worked up about 5:00.
I mean, Mark is still gonna be gorked no matter when my plane lands.
Oh, for piss sake.
He's doing another graft.
Talk about lipstick on a pig.
Hey, whoever that is better have something important for me...
'cause I'm a busy woman.
I'm sorry, Dr. Bailey.
It's your intern-- Shane Ross.
You left me with Mrs. Coggins,
and her C.T. scans just came back--
Slide it under the door.
Oh, shoot. He did. Hold on. Hold on.
Yeah, uh, yeah, she has a small... hematoma.
Um, just monitor it closely.
Only you can make a small hematoma sound sexy.
Crazy. Ahh.
Did you hear that?
I didn't hear anything.
B.C.B.'s at it again.
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
Be right back.
Alex Karev. Right.
Uh, Hunt mentioned that Robbins really liked you.
Mel Barnett. Here from Miami.
Oh, the new peds guy.
You're headed to?
Uh, Hopkins, fellowship. Leaving tonight.
That's right.
Great program.
So is this, by the way. Hunt's been filling me in.
Oh, did he, uh, tell you about our exchange program yet?
We brought over 32 kids from 5 different countries in Africa.
Hunt did mention the program, Dr. Karev.
Admirable work, but I'm afraid it doesn't fit with my agenda.
We operate on sick orphans.
How does that not fit your agenda?
Not to worry.
I've already reached out to U.C.L.A.
The program will continue, just...
Not here.
If you'll excuse me, I'm trying to close on a house.
Welcome back.
Torres.
I had nothing to do with this.
Okay. I had a little to do with this.
Well, thank you, everyone. Thank you very much.
It's really no big deal.
What?
You have to say it.
It's a beautiful day to save lives.
There's no way she pulls this off.
She might, as long as she doesn't look up at
Medusa during the surgery.
Yeah, that face will calcify her.
Do you think Medusa's always been Medusa?
Probably. I heard her mom was even worse.
Yeah, but...
that doesn't give her an excuse
to act like a demon from the depths of hell itself.
It's like she can hear us.
Yeah, that little red light...
means the intercom is on.
Now sit up straight.
I don't think that you're a demon.
Focus on what you're doing.
There it is.
Look at that.
God, I needed this.
It feels so good to finally have my hands
on a problem I can fix.
Hey, thanks for...
Nelson is on standby. Let's have him come finish.
Derek, just take a second. Just--
I'll meet you in post-op.
I had a patient once
who told me about his wedding day
and how they asked all the married couples
to come to the dance floor to dance together.
And then they asked the couples
who'd been only married a year to sit down.
And then five years, then ten years,
20, and so on,
until they got to the last two couples.
Two sets of grandparents.
Been together 60 years.
60 years with the love of their life.
That's gonna be you two
at our granddaughter's wedding.
Callie...
Arizona...
Congratulations. I love you.
What about you?
Won't you be dancing at your granddaughter's wedding?
Gotta have a partner for that.
Well, if you had a partner, who would it be?
Oh, well, that's easy.
Lexie Grey.
Dr. Torres.
Uh, not a good time.
Hey, look, the new guy, uh, Barnett,
He's shipping the--the orphan program over to U.C.L.A.
Yeah, really not a good time.
I'm leaving, so I'm not gonna be able to do anything about it,
And I know--I know Dr. Robbins wouldn't want this happen.
Oh, Alex.
Maybe you could just talk--
No, what? What? What? Just what?
I'm up to my eyeballs trying to save things around here,
and your peds program
really doesn't mean that much to me, okay?
Sometimes things die, Alex,
and there's nothing you can do about it.
Told you, not a good time.
Appendix is out.
You're not finished.
I know. Next I...
Pull up on the purse strings
and invert the stump into the cecum.
Oh, no.
Okay, you ripped the cecum wide open.
What's next?
Wilson, you have to think, quickly.
Come on. What's next?
Think.
Go in and grab your purse strings.
B.P. is dropping.
Your patient is in trouble. Go.
Okay, move. Clamp.
Irrigation.
Irrigation.
Suction over here.
I know why you favor a less-invasive approach.
But, you know, you're a creature of your generation.
I mean, you believe in 30-second rice
and instant oatmeal
and the--the, uh, news brief.
Well, no.
You're--you're looking for the--for the bullet,
the memo, the text.
Okay. Um, but--
LOL. OMG. Ha!
Okay, well, as I said,
I will open him up, but he's a baby,
so there's only room for one headlight.
So you understand? One headlight, one surgeon.
Of course I understand.
And you owe me one,
because I'm giving those fingers a good...
three hours off.
Oh, wait, wait. Oh, that's not what I meant.
I'm--I'm sorry. Just stop.
This is my case.
You want me to ditch my original plan, fine.
You want to backseat drive, also fine.
You're the attending. I'm the fellow.
I'll respect that.
But you're not stealing my surgery.
You're welcome to assist, to observe,
to yammer about the good old days,
but this is not one of them.
This is my patient, my procedure.
Headlight. Now.
Yes, doctor.
We--we shouldn't have tried the surgery today, okay?
It was too much.
Being in the O.R., thinking about Mark...
Torres
No, look, I shouldn't have been operating either.
Look at us. We're emotional. It was just...
My hand went numb in there.
It's almost 5:00.
So I discharged our cleft baby.
He'll be back in about six months.
Oh, and I...
I decided against reconstruction... for grandpa.
I know it's not what we talked about, but...
and don't take it the wrong way, all right?
Because...
You've taught me a lot.
But I think, um...
I really know what I'm doing now.
So...
I'm good.
The plastics posse's... gonna live on...
Because, uh...
because I can take it from here.
After I stop his medication, I'm gonna extubate him.
Okay, we're all doctors here. You don't need to say this.
I'm not saying it because you need to know the procedure.
I say it because even if you think you're prepared
for what's about to happen,
You're not.
Your brain can't fully absorb what we're about to do.
But by saying this...
I'm giving you a little time to catch up.
So...
after I stop his medications...
I'm gonna extubate him.
As indicated in his living will,
Dr. Sloan asked that, if life-sustaining procedures
would only prolong the moment of death,
that these procedures be discontinued.
Somewhere to be, Dr. Yang?
No. It's...
It's 5:00 in seattle.
and 4:00 a.m. in Moscow...
and 8:00 a.m. in Singapore.
Clamp.
Dr. Sloan asked that if he were unable to make
his own medical decisions,
that his directive be honored by his chosen proxy.
His final request was that only comfort care
be given to him in his final moments.
Once support is removed,
he may only hold on for a few minutes...
or the process could take hours.
I'm turning the ventilator off.
We've sedated him with morphine
so he's not feeling any of this.
Thanks.
I'll give you some privacy.
We tried so hard...
out there in the woods.
We thought if we could just get him back here alive...
I-I can't stay here.
I'm--I'm--tell Derek that I was here and I had to go.
I am, uh...
I'm going to the airport. I'm gonna go see Cristina.
Okay.
What's wrong?
Chief, sorry.
I was just going somewhere else, actually.
That surgery was designed for you to fail.
The intern appy--
It sets you as the example.
Okay?
Don't let it get to you.
Why is she so mean?
She's just trying to teach you.
No, why is she so mean?
Is it that plane crash?
What?
I heard she was in a plane crash
with some other doctors.
They were stranded in the woods for, like, a week.
People died or almost died or something.
Yeah, yeah, people died or almost died or...
something.
Dr. Grey isn't mean. She is strong.
And she's not gonna go easy on you because she knows that
that would be a disservice to you.
You are a surgeon.
It is your job to fix things other people can't.
Now if you can't handle that, leave now.
If not,
don't stand around in hallways and cry.
Cry somewhere else,
where I won't see you.
Yeah, come on in.
Dr. Cristina Yang
of Seattle fame, formerly of California.
Sit.
How'd it go with Dr. Thomas?
Uh, well, I'm happy to, uh,
take one for the team,
but I'd appreciate if you steered him
in somebody else's direction.
I'm not sure that's gonna work.
See, I've asked him to help you out,
navigating the waters and all.
I found the cafeteria.
Yeah, it's... more than that.
My work has been impeccable.
My record here is perfect.
If all you look at is outcomes, maybe.
But on our yardstick,
you don't seem to be thriving.
I want you to succeed.
But the fact is, we work as a team here.
No one here is a superstar.
Our hospital is the superstar.
And our patients...
they're superstars.
We pride ourselves on that.
No ego, no proprietary attitudes,
no competition.
Are you serious?
We're sensitive to all you've been through.
If you want to talk to someone,
I'm happy to give you names.
Dr. Parker, that won't--
Look, why don't you take a few days...
see the lakes,
check out the Mall of America?
You know, everybody says
they ride the roller coaster for their kids,
but the adults eat it up.
Go get some R&R.
Have a good time.
Soften up those sharp Seattle edges.
Doctor's orders.
I'm sorry. Is this R&R a suggestion or--
It's mandatory, Yang,
Starting now.
Anything?
No, not yet.
Here you go, doctor.
Thank you.
D-does my nickname command respect?
No.
Strike fear in the hearts of residents?
No.
Well, what is it?
You've been... happy.
And the interns noticed that your happiness
often coincides
with the arrival of-- of Dr. Warren.
And that's all I'm saying.
Oh, oh, come on now. You have to tell me.
No, I can't. I am a gentleman.
And also, I don't wanna.
Oh, come on...
Okay, I'm gonna tell you this because I'm literally
about to walk out of this hospital forever.
Mnh-mnh. Karev. Karev.
Your nickname's B.C.B.
B.C.B.?
Booty call Bailey.
That's what they call you.
Thank you.
Good-bye, Dr. Bailey.
Yeah. Bye, Karev.
Hey. So that's it?
I'm not even as good as one of your intern girls, huh?
You're not gonna say good-bye to me?
Mer, what--what are you doing here?
Don't change the subject.
Don't make this a thing.
Don't make this a thing?
Mark is dying right now.
And that's it? You're just gonna leave, too?
I'm just--I'm gonna be on the other side of the country.
It's, uh, we'll talk. It's not like--
That's what Cristina said. It's not the same.
Nothing is the same.
Everything is different.
Everyone's leaving and everyone is dying.
Don't make this my problem.
I'm finally getting the hell outta here.
I can't keep standing around being the guy
who should've been on the plane that crashed.
I shouldn't be here, Mer.
I... I should've left this freakin' place three months ago.
Alex!
Get off.
Look, I'm not gonna stay in Seattle just because
you don't want to be alone.
Look, Hopkins won't wait forever.
I got a plane to catch, so bye.
Watch it.
This is your final boarding call
for all passengers for flight 3-9-8-4.
Hold on, please.
You just made it.
Yeah.
Thank you.
On behalf of the captain and our entire crew,
welcome board flight 5-3-1
with nonstop service from Seattle...
to Rochester, Minnesota.
At this time, please make sure your seat backs
and tray tables are in their upright
and locked positions.
This aircraft is equipped with several...
I have to go.
In the event of an emergency landing...
I have to get up. I have to go.
find the nearest exit...
I have to go.
I'm sorry, miss. If you could please stay in your seat--
No, I need to leave.
You need to return to your seat.
No, no, I don't think you're hearing me.
I need to get off the plane.
I'm sorry. We're about to close the doors--
Open the door, or I'll pull the
emergency exit myself.
We can't--miss, I need you--
Get the hell out of my way. Open that damn door...
Miss--
and let me the hell off this plane!
I need you to calm--
Let me off the plane!
They say death is hardest on the living.
I had the boarding pass in my hand.
I was...
standing there watching them board the plane, but I...
couldn't move.
Next time.
We have to get past this.
I know.
What are you doing here?
Hey, who is that?
Point me.
I'm sorry about before.
You should be.
I'm sorry, too.
I thought you said he was leaving.
I thought you said you were leaving.
The guy replacing Robbins
is just gonna mess the place up.
Besides, I don't even like Baltimore.
So what are you saying?
I couldn't get on my plane, okay?
I couldn't go.
You're saying you ditched the flight
'cause you chickened out.
What a loser.
When Hunt lands,
tell him I'm staying.
What?
I just saw him here at the airport.
Isn't he coming to see you?
It's tough to actually say good-bye.
Sometimes it's impossible.
Come on, Jax. Slop time.
Just about to get you over there.
You're just gonna get--
Dr. Hunt?
Hey. Uh, your dad told me where I could find you.
What are--what are you doing here?
Mark Sloan died yesterday.
Oh, God. Um... I'm so sorry.
I want you to come back and work at the hospital.
What?
Nothing is the same over there.
It's all...
I keep trying...
I keep trying to think of ways
I could've done things differently,
And, uh...
If I'd realized they were missing sooner,
If I'd told Cristina how much I...
I keep looking for the do-overs,
And there's no do-overs.
There's just the way it is,
and I can't fix that,
except for this, for you.
Wh--
I didn't teach you, not the way that I should have.
I-I should've helped you be strong
instead of kicking you when you were down.
I should never have taken your job from you.
You don't belong out here on a... a farm.
You belong in Seattle,
saving lives.
Now come home.
Uh, I can't keep doing this alone, Arizona.
I just can't.
Get up.
Get the hell out of bed and snap out of this...
If not for me, then for Sofia,
Because she lost a parent last night.
And I lost my best friend.
And I will be damned if I lose you, too.
Snap out of this?
Snap out of this?
How the hell am I supposed to snap out of this
when you cut off my leg?
You never really stop feeling the loss.
Everybody... cheese!
Cheese.
Nothing's happening.
Oh, come on. I think it's on video.
Should I go over there?
No, just give her a second.
Well, no, it's--I'm-- I'm pressing the button.
It's just-- it's not doing anything.
Maybe it's broke and--
I'm taking over.
No, no, no. Oh, no.
I don't need your help. I don't need--
We have a kid together, Robbins.
So you're stuck with me and my help.
It's what makes things so bittersweet.
We leave little bits of ourselves behind...
little reminders...
a lifetime of memories,
photos, trinkets...
I got it.
Things to remember us by
even when we're gone.
