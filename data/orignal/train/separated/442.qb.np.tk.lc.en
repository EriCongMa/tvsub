is my baby girl on that beach ?
one of the victims that we found
fits cindi &apos;s general description .
morgan &apos;s cousin fled a stalker .
so whenever unidentified female remains turn up ,
he gets that call .
i know you , derek . there is something , isn &apos;t there ?
my auntie spent years obsessing over cindi &apos;s last few hours .
it &apos;s killing her , rossi .
i &apos;m never gonna know , am i ?
he picked out her picture .
she &apos;s dead .
hi . leave a message after the tone .
hey , mom , it &apos;s me .
they &apos;re all out of the 2 % ,
so i got 1 % instead .
and let me know if an extra 1 %
makes that much of a difference
and i &apos;ll stop at jewel or something .
all right . bye .
what--
hey !
hey !
cindi ?
oh , my god .
somebody call 911 . hurry !
hey . everything all right ?
derek , you need to come home .
what &apos;s wrong ? is it ma ?
it &apos;s desiree .
she &apos;s been hurt .
either my big brother &apos;s in the room ,
or somebody else
is wearing his nasty @-@ ass cologne .
well , hey there .
where &apos;s mom ?
i sent her home .
i wanted her to get some rest .
desi ?
what were you thinking ?
who were you chasing ?
i didn &apos;t see the driver .
but the passenger ...
yeah ?
it was cindi .
aunt yvonne &apos;s cindi ?
yes .
desi ...
she &apos;s dead .
i swear to god ,
she was as close as you are to me .
closer .
you gotta listen to me .
sometimes our mind plays tricks on us .
we invent things .
it &apos;s why eyewitness testimony is unreliable .
no . when i got her to look at me ,
she didn &apos;t just recognize me ,
she said something .
she said &quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
now , would i invent that ?
it was her .
how &apos;s your sister ?
she &apos;s awake . she &apos;s talking .
good .
morgan , take as much personal time as you need .
hotch ...
i think i might have a case out here .
what do you mean ?
look , i need to come clean about something .
i lied about someone being dead .
i &apos;m sorry ?
last year , that fisherman unsub that was dumping the bodies
in the atlantic , he claimed that my cousin
was one of his victims .
falsely . you deduced he &apos;d never met her .
i told my family it was him .
cindi had been missing for 8 years
and my aunt needed closure .
and even though i kept looking , i lied , hotch .
i lied because i wanted my family to move on .
but now there &apos;s evidence she &apos;s alive .
you still there ?
we &apos;re on our way .
what did you do ?
&quot; worse than telling a lie
is spending your whole life staying true to a lie . &quot;
robert brault .
so your cousin fled chicago 8 years ago
because a co @-@ worker was stalking her ?
yeah , a guy named john hitchens .
cindi and yvonne came to
me and asked me if they should be worried .
her emails and phone logs showed classic stalker behavior .
multiple messages every hour .
gifts he sent which she later returned .
that would enrage a stalker .
but until they become violent ,
they &apos;re smart enough to skirt the law .
human resources at the investment bank wouldn &apos;t do anything ,
and chicago p.d. couldn &apos;t .
so yvonne and i convinced cindi to move .
she contacted us from charleston on her way to savannah .
and then she was gone .
and hitchens blew his brains out two weeks later in chicago .
that was good enough for the local p.d. to conclude
that he &apos;d killed her .
except for one major detail . we never found the body .
if his endgame was suicide , he wasn &apos;t organized enough
to dispose of the body that permanently .
that &apos;s why i never stopped looking .
i just didn &apos;t think that
she would surface right back here in chicago .
we need to reopen both cases .
both cindi &apos;s disappearance and hitchens &apos; suicide .
the discrepancies in each would explain her current behavior .
morgan , i need to talk to you when we land .
i can &apos;t wait .
auntie , what are you doing here ?
your older sister called me about the accident .
she also told me what desiree saw .
look , auntie , we don &apos;t know anything for sure yet .
derek morgan , what is going on with my daughter ?
please .
detective palmer , what do you have ?
i wish we had more to give you .
you know how missing persons cases are .
actually , there &apos;s quite a bit here .
these were found in hitchens &apos; apartment after the suicide .
some were blown up from the original film stock .
so if hitchens took them , he didn &apos;t
zoom in on photoshop . he &apos;s an old @-@ school shutterbug .
reid and prentiss , check hitchens &apos; photographic background .
even 8 years ago , most people had gone digital .
the gun hitchens used to kill himself
was traced to this dealer .
local guy . completely by the book . no record .
the .44 was the only gun in hitchens &apos; possession .
that &apos;s a big gun to kill yourself with .
we should talk to the dealer ,
find out what his mindset was when he bought it .
um , i sent you the case file chicago p.d. sent me .
i got it .
yeah . so there &apos;s that .
bad , huh ?
yeah . yeah . it &apos;s pretty bad .
penelope , can you just talk to me ?
yeah , what about ?
i don &apos;t care . just--just talk .
ok , um ...
what ?
i--god , this is the first time in my life
i don &apos;t have anything to say .
except that i &apos;m-- i &apos;m here for you .
ok , derek ? i &apos;m right here .
yeah , i know you are .
the gun was bought 8 years ago ?
at least , if not longer .
here we go .
oh , yeah .
there he is .
john hitchens ?
hitchens ?
no , ma &apos;am . the fellow who bought this piece was malcolm ford .
excuse me .
well , maybe the gun traded hands .
malcolm ford sold it to hitchens ,
and hitchens shot himself ?
or he never sold it to hitchens at all . he used it on him .
so i guess the real question here is , who &apos;s malcolm ford ?
we &apos;re leaving .
ready .
wait .
put this in the glove box .
good day .
hey .
getting away for the weekend ?
just headed up to the cabin .
ah . have fun .
will do .
malcolm , do we have to do this ?
maybe she didn &apos;t recognize me .
maybe . but we can &apos;t take that chance .
so cindi had two stalkers .
no , only one . ford fits the profile better than hitchens .
ford had multiple assault and harassment charges ,
all filed by ex @-@ girlfriends and random women he met .
and garcia found credit card purchases
for black and white photographic equipment for ford .
so this guy killed hitchens and then set him up .
behaviorally it would make sense .
if ford was stalking your cousin ,
he would have seen hitchens as competition ,
so he kills him and he plants
the photos to throw off your investigation .
hotch , i want to bring this guy in and question him personally .
garcia just sent us his address .
morgan .
have you told your aunt about any of this ?
she , uh ... yeah .
we need to know how ford found cindi .
so you need to ask her .
is that it ?
that &apos;s it .
fbi !
it &apos;s clear here .
clear .
clear .
guys .
the house is empty , but there &apos;s evidence
of a woman living here .
looks like they both packed up in a hurry .
they were trying to cover their tracks .
what the hell is she doing with this guy ?
hello , you two .
you must be cindi .
dominic has told me so much about you .
this is dominic and is wife suzy .
they &apos;re gonna help us out .
cindi ? you have permission .
thank you for all your help .
please let me know if i can be of service .
impressive .
can we hide the car ?
yeah . there &apos;s room in the garage .
and i &apos;ve been in touch with a guy who can get you into canada .
we &apos;re not going to the cabin ?
why don &apos;t i take you inside ?
right this way .
let me give you the tour .
how long you been married ?
12 years .
want to know the secret ?
communication .
he talks , i listen .
down here , sweetheart .
this is my room .
you can take the bed .
i wouldn &apos;t do that .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a head box .
he would take my cousin &apos;s head
and put it through the hole , and then he &apos;d ...
morgan , we need to deliver a profile .
why , reid ?
we know who the unsub is .
we need to deliver the profile .
i &apos;ve had lots of servants , but none like her .
how &apos;d you do it ?
told her about the company
and what they &apos;d do to her if she didn &apos;t behave .
oh . there &apos;s one number programmed on here .
he &apos;ll get you to toronto tonight .
he a company man ?
you can trust him .
auntie ...
do you know that man ?
yes .
he went to the church cindi and i went to .
did you talk to him ?
he talked to us .
is this him ?
yes .
most stalkers have the delusion
that the woman that they &apos;re after wants to be with them .
but not this man .
he lays low and he follows you .
he watched us pack up cindi .
and then he kept watching her
all the way to charleston .
but if he brought her back here ,
why didn &apos;t she try to escape ?
after 8 years in captivity
at the hands of malcolm ford ,
we believe cindi burns &apos; ego has been shattered .
as a result , he could afford to give her some degree of freedom
and trust that she would stay with him .
which is why it &apos;s going to be very difficult
to get cindi away from her captor .
we believe she &apos;s suffering an extreme form of stockholm syndrome .
like that girl from the seventies , hearst .
patty hearst , that &apos;s right .
so is cindi gonna start robbing banks now ?
no . he &apos;s done something a lot worse .
he got her to believe in the company .
what &apos;s the company ?
it &apos;s a sadomasochistic role play scenario ,
a game , essentially ,
in which a cabal of men tell their submissives
they can trade their slaves at their whim .
if you displease your master or try to escape ,
the company will find you , kill you , and kill your family .
the voluntary submissives understand that it &apos;s just a fantasy ,
but malcolm ford has gotten cindi to believe it &apos;s real .
how ?
this was dated 3 years after her abduction .
which means for the last 5 years ,
her only reality was his unending abuse .
then he gave her this .
this is a slave contract .
she signed her name .
my baby girl .
the documentation we &apos;ve found on the company
informs our profile and will inform your manhunt ,
because it might point to where malcolm ford is now .
the language on their contract
speaks of an underground network ,
which tells us that he has a few men he trusts .
which means that what started as an s &amp; m game
could now be a ring .
all right .
he said this is where he &apos;d pick us up .
stop it . right now .
yes , sir .
i think it &apos;s time for a lesson .
no ! i &apos;ll behave , i promise .
please , i &apos;ll behave , i promise .
you had your chance .
i want you to get that damn cabin out of your mind , ok ?
&apos;cause we &apos;re not coming back .
is that clear ?
clear .
now go get me something to eat .
stop .
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
you &apos;re thinking you got nothing left .
but that &apos;s not true .
you got family .
malcolm , please , he &apos;s not a threat to us .
but you are .
and when you think about your next step ,
i want you to think about this .
i got eyes on him right now .
one phone call from me and he &apos;s dead in 30 seconds .
is that what you want ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
what &apos;s going on ?
you said you wanted dinner . it was an accident .
sir , what &apos;s the problem ?
my wife forgot to put this back .
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m gonna need to check your purse .
no . it &apos;s just a misunderstanding .
ma &apos;am , please come with me .
look ,
we &apos;re paying for it , ok ?
it &apos;s a misunderstanding and we &apos;re leaving .
i just thought i was doing what you told me to do .
malcolm , please . i &apos;m really sorry .
we can make it if we leave right now .
we &apos;ll just go . we can leave right now .
you &apos;re gonna pay for this .
garcia , did you get a hit ?
yes . a 911 call at a grocery store
identifying a couple matching their description .
now , hotch and the gang on their way ,
but you guys are closer .
take a left .
i got it . hang on .
there he is .
i see him .
get out of the car and put your hands where i can see them .
put your hands behind your head and get on your knees .
is there a problem , sir ?
what do you got , morgan ?
nothing .
what do you mean , nothing ?
the car is empty .
morgan ?
agent derek morgan ?
ha ha . well , well .
where is she ?
where is who ?
where is she ?
derek .
get up .
officer .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m going to ride back to the station with him .
oh , no , you &apos;re not . you &apos;re gonna stay here processing the scene .
rossi , come on .
no .
yeah .
baby , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s been a long night .
ok , mr . snappy .
i was just letting you know
that i sent the grocery store security camera footage
to your tablet .
you &apos;re welcome .
ok , out with it . where &apos;s your head at presently ?
honestly , i &apos;m trying to figure out
why i &apos;m not back at that police station
trying to break this son of a bitch .
what are you doing ? what was that for ?
for thinking that this is about you .
penelope , it is about me . he called me out by name .
will you stop doing that .
seriously , derek , seriously--
you know , in the entire time i have known you ,
you are like the glistening hero in the movie of life .
and now , just because some guy , some ass @-@ hat guy
decides to call you out by name ,
you think you have the right to get all weird
and decide &quot; this time it &apos;s personal &quot; ?
really ? derek , did you ever stop to think that said ass @-@ hat
is exhibiting this behavior just to get under your skin ?
as a matter of fact , i have .
ok , you know , well , a real hero
would roll with that instead of tripping over his gigantic ego .
and as a wise black man once told me ,
baby girl , you be trippin &apos; . so i tell you what--
why don &apos;t you call me back
once you &apos;ve gotten off the self @-@ absorption train
and decide to be a real hero ,
the kind that cindi is waiting for .
i am hanging up on you .
hey , detective .
yeah .
is this what my cousin stole ?
well , according to the manager .
she said it was an accident .
no .
no .
she knew exactly what she was doing .
how &apos;s it going ?
he hasn &apos;t asked for a lawyer yet .
he &apos;s baiting us .
which means we need an interrogation strategy to throw him off .
he &apos;s expecting morgan .
so then i get home and , of course ,
he &apos;s still up past his bedtime .
uh . ohh . it reminds me why i &apos;m not married .
oh , well , neither am i , technically .
oh , yeah , you &apos;re right . that &apos;s true .
do you guys ever--
oh . no , i really don &apos;t need a man
to tell me what to do .
yeah .
excuse me . shh .
uh , the adults are talking .
when it &apos;s your turn to speak ,
i &apos;ll give you permission .
ok ? so , anyway ...
yeah . any sleep ?
uh , no . of course not .
what are we doing here anyway ?
oh , yeah . um ...
oh , ok . so , yeah .
mal , you want to confess now
or just go straight to prison ?
look , my wife and i had a disagreement in that store .
whoa--wife ?
you &apos;re married ?
no . this is about john hitchens .
his suicide is looking more like a murder
and the gun traces back to you .
ok . uh , let &apos;s go talk to this wife .
he &apos;s not talking .
i don &apos;t know who this hitchens person is ,
but if you had anything , you &apos;d charge me already .
you &apos;re here because of cindi .
caught us .
you know what ? this is my favorite part .
this is where you hang yourself with your own tongue .
so , please , keep talking .
what are you doing here ?
you got a baby at home
being raised by a man you &apos;re not married to .
what are you doing here ?
well , it &apos;s work . but we make it work .
where &apos;s cindi ?
huh . work .
i know all about work .
negotiating who does the dishes ,
fighting over who fold the laundry .
except cindi and i never fight .
she knows her role .
after you beat her into signing a contract .
what we have is a bond you know nothing about .
but i &apos;ll tell you about it .
if you ask permission .
come on .
you &apos;re curious , aren &apos;t you ?
you want to know our secret .
please let me go back in there .
no .
his guard is down . he thinks he can manipulate me .
we can &apos;t give him what he wants .
we need to keep him off balance .
then let me go in .
i can get in his head .
the way he got into yours ?
look , i know i have no right to ask this ,
but please just trust me on this .
i can break him .
what time is it ?
you know what that is ?
my dinner .
the time ?
when i was growing up , my dad worked midnights .
my mom worked pretty late , too .
so me and my sisters had a
lot of dinners at cindi and my aunt &apos;s house .
it was kind of fun .
because you get to eat the stuff
that you don &apos;t always get to eat at home .
stuff like this .
same label , same everything .
it feels like 10 : 00 , maybe 10 : 15 .
let &apos;s say 10 : 15 .
so when cindi stole this ,
it was no accident , malcolm .
she was sending a message to me .
a message ?
for 8 years you beat her down
to where she could barely look up .
but when my sister saw her at that intersection , cindi knew .
she knew i would come for her .
so she was letting me know that she &apos;s still in there ,
that she &apos;s alive and she &apos;s waiting .
she wouldn &apos;t do that .
oh , yes , she would .
she had a whole storeful of food to choose from ,
malcolm , and she chose that .
she fought you for as long as she could ,
and now she &apos;s fighting you
again and you can &apos;t handle that , can you ?
what time is it ?
you know , it &apos;s funny
that you keep mentioning the time .
you had 20 minutes from the store to your arrest .
you knew we were coming . why didn &apos;t you run ?
you could have easily got away , but you didn &apos;t .
so something must have slowed you down .
cindi slowed you down , didn &apos;t she ?
and you knew you couldn &apos;t be found
with a crying , bleeding prisoner in your car ,
so you kicked her to the curb .
you wish it could be that easy .
but it &apos;s not .
then explain it to me .
what don &apos;t i know , malcolm ?
you don &apos;t know what she became .
you don &apos;t know the love she had for me .
had ?
you just said &quot; had , &quot; past tense .
you have a love if she &apos;s alive .
you had one if she &apos;s dead .
what did you do to her ? !
morgan .
no . no , you didn &apos;t have enough time
to dispose of the body properly . we know that .
and we will find her .
morgan , out .
and when we do , i will personally nail your ass to the wall .
that &apos;s what time it is , bitch !
10 : 30 now ?
bet it is .
yeah . feels like 10 : 30 .
what was that for ?
i was in control . i wasn &apos;t gonna hurt him .
someone &apos;s retained a lawyer on malcolm &apos;s behalf .
he didn &apos;t invoke .
i did .
cindi .
oh , my god .
stop .
you &apos;re not to speak to her or malcolm ford
without me present .
what the hell is this ?
you &apos;re holding my client on suspicion of kidnapping .
as you can see , the victim &apos;s alive and well .
kept against her will .
no . he &apos;s my husband . now drop the charges .
cindi , why are you doing this ?
because i love him .
we &apos;ve been clear that we would like all charges dropped .
we still have some questions about john hitchens .
and mr . ford has explained that the gun
that hitchens used to shoot himself was stolen .
he even filed a police report .
so , what else do you need to know ?
we need a new plan . we can &apos;t hold him .
there &apos;s one more thing .
wait .
i can &apos;t talk to you .
no , no . it &apos;s ok .
i trust you .
baby ...
let me just ...
let me just look at you .
what has he done to you ?
he loves me .
you call that love ?
i have to go .
i have to make him dinner .
that &apos;s not her .
that is not my daughter .
you did good .
you mean it ?
let &apos;s go to the cabin .
we need to rethink the profile .
this ain &apos;t stockholm .
it could be battered wife syndrome .
no , it &apos;s not .
morgan , the way they hugged each other ,
i--i think she genuinely loves him .
i &apos;m telling you ,
that &apos;s not the woman i know . she wouldn &apos;t do that .
so what is it , derek ? why would she behave this way ?
she said she needed to cook dinner for him .
is that what you cook for your husband ?
would you make that for will ?
no . i might for henry , though .
exactly .
when i was growing up , this is what cindi and i ate .
this exact brand .
hotch , what did your mom make you for breakfast ?
oatmeal and orange juice .
what do you make for jack ?
oatmeal and orange juice .
same brand .
mm @-@ hmm . yeah .
she might have been cooking dinner ,
but it was not for malcolm ford .
you think they have a child .
yes , i do .
we didn &apos;t profile that .
there &apos;s no evidence of one in the home or in their lives .
unless ford keeps the child from her to keep her in line .
i mean , that fits the profile .
it &apos;s a stretch .
it &apos;s the only theory that would explain her behavior .
all right , morgan .
prove it .
you want me to file a harassment suit against the fbi ?
no , i don &apos;t .
i just have a couple more questions about the case .
actually , these are questions that only you can answer .
for the life of me , i couldn &apos;t figure out
how a woman could be held prisoner for over 8 years
and retain a lawyer so quickly .
i mean , how could she do that ,
unless malcolm told her where to go ?
malcolm and i know each other . so ?
except he needed a lawyer
who understood the delicacy of his situation , didn &apos;t he ?
so i did some digging .
and i found out about your mail order bride from russia .
if i sat her down and i asked her about the company ,
what do you think she would tell me ?
ok , look .
i &apos;m a negotiator , so let &apos;s negotiate .
do you know where they keep the children ?
yeah .
you better tell me where it is .
you want us to wake up the boy ?
i &apos;ll do it .
mama ?
hi , baby .
it &apos;s not christmas . what are you doing here ?
we &apos;re gonna go with daddy on a little trip , ok ?
let &apos;s get your shoes .
come on . move , move . let &apos;s go .
go , go , go !
go inside .
we are in position .
unit one has suspect in custody .
where &apos;s malcolm ford ?
clear .
my god , how many do they have here ?
secure the kids .
mommy !
cindi .
come on , baby , talk to me .
cindi , it &apos;s derek .
stop !
cindi , wait !
he &apos;s gotten you to believe in a lie .
the company is not real .
i know . derek , step aside .
let &apos;s go home .
ok .
hi .
malcolm ford ,
you &apos;re under arrest
for kidnapping ,
child endangerment ,
and the murder of john hitchens .
so , um ...
can you tell me that secret now ?
anthony .
come here .
this is your uncle .
he &apos;s come a long way to meet you .
how you doing , anthony ?
my name &apos;s derek .
you ready ?
