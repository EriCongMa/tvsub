what &apos;s a pretty little thing like you doing out here all alone ?
no , no , no .
come here .
angie .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
group therapy . have you thought any more about it ?
i really think that it would help you to spend some time around people
who share your experience .
no ! no
my experience ?
dreams again ?
do we have to do this today ?
yes .
okay .
prance , showhorse .
sweetie !
hey , angie . hey , angie , wait up .
please don &apos;t call me that .
come on , what is it ? i mean , do i smell ?
i have bad breath ?
i just don &apos;t like to be called angie .
one minute . what happened to you ?
i &apos;m just trying to be friends here .
why ?
what &apos;s wrong with being friendly ?
jesus .
go make friends with gloria .
or saperstein .
you &apos;re really tough .
look , not everybody &apos;s trying to get into your pants .
no , not everyone . but you are .
nice tits .
great ass , too .
damn , girl .
where you running to all fast like that , huh , girl ?
looking good .
take you to the back of dingo &apos;s car . ain &apos;t that right , dingo ?
yeah .
whoa , where you going ?
name &apos;s chief , baby .
what &apos;s your name ?
damn !
oh , you ain &apos;t got--you ain &apos;t got no name .
okay . that &apos;s cool , too , baby .
if you &apos;re having dreams when you &apos;re awake ,
that means you &apos;re crazy , doesn &apos;t it ?
not necessarily .
are you having dreams while you &apos;re awake ?
more like fantasies .
what do you fantasize about ?
justice .
what about it ?
you don &apos;t feel that you &apos;ve received justice ?
justice isn &apos;t something you receive .
it &apos;s something you dish out .
is that from a fortune cookie ?
out there , it &apos;s all predators and prey .
you &apos;re either one or the other .
what about friends ?
everybody &apos;s after something .
protection . companionship . whatever .
but you &apos;re either getting or giving no matter what you call it .
that may be a bit narrow .
you don &apos;t believe in altruism ?
you mean the do @-@ gooders ?
can &apos;t stand the do @-@ gooders .
they &apos;re the ones who think they really aren &apos;t after anything .
they just want to be friends .
like that &apos;s some magical gift to the universe
with no strings attached .
pretty bleak world view .
there &apos;s always strings attached .
need a lift ?
no .
come on , angie--angela . angela .
you know , if you ask really nicely ,
i &apos;m sure saperstein will give you a handy in the supply closet .
look , not every guy is an asshole .
but you &apos;ll never know that if you don &apos;t give somebody a chance .
they say that rape is about power , not sex ,
but that &apos;s kind of bullshit .
of course it &apos;s about sex .
it &apos;s very specifically about sex .
to hurt you as deeply as possible .
complete devastation .
like when soldiers don &apos;t just defeat their enemy ,
they burn their villages and foul their water supply , you know ?
don &apos;t just kill the natives , kill the buffalo .
kill what &apos;s sacred to them so the body is just a shell
to be crushed beneath your boot .
thank you so much for sharing with us this night , mallory .
your views are always ... illuminating .
i do want to take a moment
to welcome a new member to the group tonight .
everyone , this is angela .
hi , angela .
now , angela , as this is a sacred space
where it is safe to share , i do invite you to share with us tonight .
i &apos;d rather not .
that &apos;s okay . there &apos;s no pressure here .
everybody participates at their own pace .
now might be a good time to take a quick potty break
and let you caffeine drinkers get your fix of free coffee .
are you all right , dear ?
hi .
i &apos;m oscar kosca .
spelled with a sca but pronounced like a z.
nobody gets it right .
angela jitrenka .
ah , it &apos;s czech , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
yeah , jitrenka . it means morning star .
like lucifer .
i &apos;m sorry ?
lucifer was also called morning star .
venus is actually the morning star
since it precedes the sun in the sky ,
but the romans called it lux ferre .
lucifer .
i thought he was the devil .
and god &apos;s most beautiful angel before the fall .
one of the avenging angels , actually .
you know a lot about this .
well , my daughter ,
she knew all the angels .
she knew their names . she knew which one was for what .
you know , all that stuff .
her room was just covered with angels .
just wings and ...
and i &apos;m sorry . excuse me .
she &apos;s dead .
his daughter , i mean .
the guy who raped her got off on some technicality .
she killed herself . cops and lawyers , right ?
he &apos;s way fucked up .
i need a smoke . want one ?
first time ?
no , but it &apos;s been a while .
first group .
yeah .
don &apos;t worry . i won &apos;t ask .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll hear all about it in one of our little weep sessions .
how do you stand it ?
ha , it &apos;s better than slitting my wrists .
i think .
look , it &apos;s not ...
i mean , i keep coming back , you know ?
it must be doing something .
but some days ...
some days i &apos;d rather not think about it .
you know ? of course , if i could do that ,
i wouldn &apos;t be here in the first place .
maybe i &apos;ll see you around .
you &apos;re not going back in ?
i &apos;ve had enough victims for one night .
see you next time , maybe .
what &apos;s up , baby girl ?
i waited for you all night .
what &apos;s the matter , sweetie ?
got something special for you .
something special ?
i hope you &apos;ve got a tennis bracelet down your pants ,
&apos;cause there sure ain &apos;t nothing special about your cock .
it is a cock , right ?
it &apos;s not just like a little puffy pussy ?
back off , bitch .
oh , is that the best you got ?
you &apos;re never gonna get laid with game like that , chief .
get a job and a nice car ,
not that piece of shit i see you driving around in .
if you want pussy , you &apos;re gonna have to pay for it
&apos;cause i really can &apos;t see anybody fucking you for free .
dykes .
it &apos;s a sad thing when a straight woman
would rather eat pussy than fuck your sorry ass .
ooh ! shit !
what the fuck was that , man ?
don &apos;t mind them .
their cocks make them stupid .
it &apos;s true . i saw it in a documentary .
it sucks all the blood from their brains .
the bigger their dicks , the dumber they get .
he must be hung like a horse .
come on , you &apos;re buying me a drink .
i live right there .
where ?
on 14th .
i &apos;m on elm .
no kidding ? we should scissor each other .
shut up .
so chief &apos;s dad
owns some , like , electronics franchise or something .
he &apos;s hardly an urban gangster .
well , if it &apos;s an act , it scared me .
i mean , do they have mothers , sisters ?
how do they learn to speak to women like that ?
you know what ? i don &apos;t give a shit how women are spoken to
or objectified by rap music lyrics or whatever .
i mean , people got raped in palaces
where everybody spoke poetry .
i &apos;d rather he talked to me like that than pretend .
at least it &apos;s honest . i mean , like , talking nice ,
it is just , like , dressed @-@ up bullshit .
yeah .
like the do @-@ gooders .
huh ?
oh , nothing . there &apos;s this guy at my work
who just wants to be friends .
oh , yeah , he wants you to say hello to his little friend .
his very little friend , most likely .
yes .
no chance he &apos;s one of the good ones ?
there are good ones ?
yeah , sure . and unicorns , too . haven &apos;t you heard ?
i &apos;ll tell you what .
he does put a hand on you , you really ought to shank the bastard .
i mean , it &apos;s an office , right ? grab one of those letter openers ,
jab it in his inner thigh , watch him bleed out .
that &apos;s graphic .
i &apos;m sorry . i just say whatever .
i don &apos;t give a shit . i &apos;m so sorry .
no , it &apos;s okay .
all that political correctness is pretty irritating anyway .
mm @-@ hmm .
that group lady lynne is really hard to take .
she &apos;s a fucking idiot .
everything with her is healing and forgiveness .
i can &apos;t take that turquoise sedona bullshit .
you know , you want to give these women hope ?
give them vengeance .
yeah .
well , i &apos;m not sure that fixes anything either .
it fixes them .
all these women in abusive relationships ,
they should be learning how to poison soup .
yes , but do you have any extreme views ?
look , i &apos;m no angel .
i &apos;ve done some weird shit in the bedroom .
but that was consenting , you know ?
when my ex came at me with his ...
that was it .
i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m not kidding . i &apos;m not gonna be handled again .
not by anybody . i mean , you trust someone ,
you let them in , they fuck you up .
fuck that , you know ? and the cops won &apos;t help you .
nobody will help you . you have to do it yourself .
you have to walk out and never look back .
and if that doesn &apos;t work ,
you take a paring knife and you fillet it like a fish .
you pull the guts out and you cut the fucking head off .
how you doing ?
i &apos;m so grateful for this group .
thank you , kensly .
want to get a beer after ?
cassie .
sure .
are you ready to share ?
my parents got divorced when i was seven .
my mom , she took it really hard .
and , you know , really .
well , it was a big deal when she met ron .
you know , &apos; cause she &apos;d been so unhappy for so long
and now she was happy again and everybody was , like , relieved .
and ron was like this big hero to everyone ,
which i always thought was pretty shitty when you think about it , you know ?
so at first--
at first i didn &apos;t say anything ,
like , when he started .
and , you know , the weirdest thing about it
is that i still sometimes think about it .
like all twisted around and stuff .
like i deserved it or something .
and because of that ,
because i didn &apos;t say something right away ,
like that meant that i liked it or something .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s dumb or whatever .
but that &apos;s just the way i used to think about it .
are you kidding me ?
the guy still lives there .
how is that even possible ?
well , the stepdad ron , he denied it .
and the mom never really believed
that anything happened in the first place , so ...
so she just has to live with a guy who rapes her ?
mmm @-@ hmm . and she &apos;s terrified--
terrified that her mom &apos;s gonna find out about group .
she thinks she &apos;s smoking pot with the neighbor .
how fucked up is that ?
a teenager sneaking out of the house for rape counseling .
shitty rape counseling .
it &apos;s just what i &apos;m always saying , you know ?
give a woman a fish and she makes dinner for her piece @-@ of @-@ shit husband .
teach the woman to kill the piece @-@ of @-@ shit husband ,
and she never has to make dinner again .
a message of hope . it &apos;s beautiful , really .
it &apos;s like an epidemic of browbeaten women
too afraid to stand up against abusive men .
i mean , that &apos;s family values for you .
wives and daughters trapped in little boxes
stacked side by side in neat little rows
with monsters in there torturing them year after year .
that &apos;s the institution of marriage
that everybody is so desperate to protect
where women are slaves to pedophiles and wife @-@ beaters .
that &apos;s the way some of them want it .
they get off on it .
can only come if they &apos;re getting the shit beat out of them .
that &apos;s the way mine is .
yeah , we &apos;re gonna need some shots .
he &apos;s drunk .
come on .
oh , my god .
he &apos;s so drunk .
man moves fast .
he &apos;s like the fastest drunk in the world .
what are you doing ?
he &apos;s got his--i don &apos;t know .
that how she likes it ?
you old fuck .
whoo @-@ hoo !
whoo @-@ hoo !
check it out .
adult circumcision .
if you need a pole that long .
eh , this is more like it .
this shit is just laying out .
not locked up or anything , no background checks to buy one ,
and you can do some serious damage with some of this .
see , i &apos;m an old @-@ fashioned girl with simpler tastes .
okay , okay , madame thor .
simplicity .
bare @-@ knuckle simplicity .
ow ! ow !
oops .
hey !
a friend ?
isn &apos;t that what you wanted ?
it &apos;s not about what i want .
oh , can we skip the freudian double @-@ talk , please ?
no , i call bullshit .
you make a friend and you say it &apos;s &apos; cause i wanted it ?
what do you want ?
nobody out there is gonna ask you that question
&apos;cause they don &apos;t give a shit .
do you ?
do i what ?
give a shit .
you &apos;re a pain in the ass .
i believe that &apos;s carl jung you &apos;re quoting , isn &apos;t it ?
do you trust her ?
do you feel like you can trust a new person ?
what about strings ? you said everybody has strings attached .
you still believe that ?
absolutely .
bye . have a good day , ron .
bye , honey .
cassie , you &apos;re not gonna say bye ?
got a hug for daddy ?
why are we here ?
bye .
i was curious .
why ?
some people deserve a dirty trick .
like a real dirty trick .
and some people
aren &apos;t strong enough to deliver it themselves .
what is wrong with you ?
what is the matter ? i don &apos;t understand .
sweetheart .
these are my favorite .
damn it , ron .
what ?
how long have you been doing this ?
uh , a couple days .
how &apos;d you find him ?
i followed cassie .
hey , my mom told me
that a good person does the right thing even when no one is looking .
he &apos;s a real peach , ain &apos;t he ?
can we be done playing spy now ?
almost .
he goes home every day for lunch .
come on .
here , put this on .
what is it ?
pardon me .
oh , god !
stop !
here , take it . it &apos;s all i &apos;ve got .
take it . take it .
whoo !
oh , god .
whoa , this is you , ron ?
god .
please , just take what--
no . no .
no , ron . i &apos;m talking now .
you are listening .
oh , this isn &apos;t your address , but we already knew that .
you see , we &apos;ve been watching you
and we &apos;re gonna keep watching you .
and if we see anything we don &apos;t like ,
we &apos;re gonna pay you a visit .
do you understand , ron ?
please , just ... -do you understand , ron ? !
just say it . i can &apos;t talk .
just say it .
i understand . please , just don &apos;t ...
shh , shh , shh , shh .
listening again .
go to the cops , we &apos;ll find you .
harass anyone , eyeball anyone ,
so much as make one woman feel slightly uncomfortable ,
and we &apos;re gonna make you regret it .
you are a piece of shit , ron .
quit being a piece of shit .
and if you don &apos;t , you will pay .
ow .
you believe me , don &apos;t you , ron ?
yeah .
good . now , last thing ,
since i can &apos;t have you following me .
whoops . wink .
whoo @-@ hoo .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
can you believe that shit ? whoo !
what did you do , you crazy bitch ?
holy crap . holy crap . holy crap , i &apos;m shaking .
my god ! why didn &apos;t you tell me what you were doing .
i was afraid you &apos;d talk me out of it .
i would have . what the hell ?
holy crap ! i can &apos;t believe we actually did it .
you conked him on the head . a lot .
you could have killed him .
i was trying to knock him out .
yeah , but you just kept whacking him on the head .
he &apos;s probably got a concussion .
i &apos;m sorry , this isn &apos;t funny .
this is not funny .
screw that piece of shit .
score one for cassie .
let &apos;s go .
ron &apos;s buying lunch .
it &apos;s not like he admitted anything ,
but i don &apos;t know .
it is different .
it meant a lot when he said it , you know ?
even not saying what he &apos;s sorry for .
then he &apos;s been , i don &apos;t know , different .
nicer .
i don &apos;t know what happened to him ,
but i hope he doesn &apos;t bump his head again
and go back to how things were .
at least now you know .
he gets out of line again , you just whack him in the head .
i think we &apos;re all here to get away from violence ,
don &apos;t you think , marla ?
no , lynny @-@ lynne @-@ lynne . no , i don &apos;t think that .
in fact , i think the exact opposite of that .
maybe it &apos;s time this group of bitches started getting a little of their own .
hey , where you going ?
i got to meet somebody .
i thought we &apos;d celebrate .
can you believe it ?
what ?
cassie and ron . i mean , it actually worked .
yeah . i got to go .
are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
just ex @-@ boyfriend shit .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
he &apos;s just got some stuff of mine i &apos;ve been trying to get back .
i should go with you .
no , it &apos;s complicated .
there &apos;s a restraining order involved ,
so i kind of have to go through channels , you know ?
look , i &apos;ll meet you thursday before group .
for coffee ?
yeah , sure .
see you at monty &apos;s .
hey there . hey .
sorry to intrude .
i &apos;m going down to pits with gloria and saperstein
for some drinks if you &apos;d like to come .
it &apos;s not a date .
it &apos;s just coworkers going out for a beer .
actually , i tried to get gloria to ask you ,
but she &apos;s ... she &apos;s kind of scared of you .
scared of me ?
she &apos;s sensitive , you know ?
and i &apos;m a bitch .
oh , no , no . i didn &apos;t say that .
no , i &apos;ve been mean . i &apos;m sorry .
look , i &apos;m meeting a friend tonight .
i completely get it . no .
but , hey , ask me again sometime .
i will . i will .
or have gloria do it .
i &apos;ll try not to be so terrifying .
sure . have a good night .
hey !
how you doing ?
over here . come over here .
thanks .
sure .
angela , i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , it &apos;s just terrible . i &apos;m so sorry .
what &apos;s going on ?
you ... you don &apos;t know ?
i &apos;m afraid that i don &apos;t have good tidings .
the worst , in fact .
and i want you to prepare yourself .
what ?
it &apos;s marla .
i don &apos;t know how else to say this .
our dear friend marla finch
has passed .
has passed ?
i know . i know it &apos;s hard .
she &apos;s passed on . she &apos;s ... she &apos;s crossed over .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
anger is a very normal reaction .
a normal reaction to what ?
what are you telling me , lynne ?
are you telling me that marla &apos;s dead ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
stop fucking saying that and tell me what happened .
angela , i am sorry . i don &apos;t know .
i was contacted by a police detective this afternoon .
he told me that marla had been found dead
and that he needed to come here to speak to the group tonight .
how did she die ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t know .
i know it &apos;s a terrible shock .
i think that we need to be here for each other .
this is a safe place where we can feel and react
and start the mourning process together .
you bitch .
i &apos;m sorry , angela .
oh .
i think that &apos;s him .
sweetheart , can i get you anything ?
something to vomit in .
everyone .
this is detective mcdylan .
he &apos;s here from the police department .
please sit down .
should i ...
yes , please .
uh , hi , everyone .
first of all , i really appreciate you
letting me come and talk to the group tonight .
as most of you are already aware ,
early this morning we did discover the body of miss finch .
now this is a homicide investigation .
i myself , i &apos;m actually with svu .
a special victims unit often assists ...
i thought svu dealt with rape crimes .
well , we do deal with assaults , yes .
but svu also assists in homicide investigations
when there &apos;s issues of abuse .
was she raped ?
oscar . you &apos;re oscar kosca , right ?
my name is &quot; koza . &quot; mr. kosca .
now , i don &apos;t mean to offend you , officer mcdylan .
it &apos;s detective .
okay , detective .
this is a sacred circle .
it &apos;s a place of trust and i don &apos;t think
it &apos;s an appropriate venue
for you to be doing your ... your ...
whatever the hell it is that you &apos;re doing right now .
oscar , detective mcdylan is an invited guest .
well , i most certainly did not invite him here , lynne .
and i would not have invited him here .
and i think it was a big mistake for you to do so .
okay
i have the floor , sir .
i have the floor .
okay , okay .
see ? this is ... this is exactly what i was afraid of .
the police , they don &apos;t care about us .
they don &apos;t care about the victims .
these guys with their investigations .
all they want to do is document things .
they want to dot their ls and cross their ts .
you know , our friend is dead , sir .
and while you &apos;re doing your stupid paperwork ,
a beautiful girl is dead .
oscar !
oh , my goodness .
that &apos;s okay . that &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay . um , look , guys ,
all i &apos;m trying to do here is just figure out her whereabouts
in the past 48 hours .
so anything you can think of that might be helpful ,
i &apos;d really appreciate it .
just anything at all .
okay , tell you what .
i &apos;m gonna go get a cup of coffee
and i &apos;m gonna hang around for a little bit ,
and if you can think of anything , please don &apos;t hesitate .
i &apos;ll be right over there , okay ?
thank you for your time .
sorry about oscar .
he &apos;s a bit high @-@ strung .
yeah , he seems that way .
his daughter was raped .
then the guy who did it got off on a technicality .
she killed herself .
so he &apos;s earned his distrust of the police .
jesus .
can you tell me what happened to marla ?
um ... -she was a friend of mine .
i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
maybe i can help you .
yes , absolutely .
if you can think of anything suspicious
or anybody who maybe had any kind of problem with her .
anything at all .
so she was definitely murdered ?
unfortunately , yeah . yeah , she was .
was she assaulted ?
i can &apos;t really discuss specifics of the case .
it was her ex @-@ boyfriend , wasn &apos;t it ?
would you let me buy you a decent cup of coffee somewhere ?
sure , yeah .
i know a place .
great .
well , it doesn &apos;t make sense .
she knew better than to put herself at risk .
people do stupid shit .
you know , even the smart ones .
i can &apos;t tell you how many times strong @-@ seeming women
refuse to press charges when their boyfriend or husband
smacked them around or worse .
and you &apos;re right , it doesn &apos;t make sense .
she was smarter than that , i &apos;m telling you .
she would not have put herself in some kind of a situation
with somebody who could hurt--
what ?
hey , what is it ?
if you know something , you should tell me .
uh , it &apos;s nothing .
no , no , hey .
you should tell me .
i think you want to tell me , so ...
she was a strong girl . hard .
you think maybe she was into weird shit ,
like , i don &apos;t know , rough sex ?
no , that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying .
okay .
you guys were close ?
yeah .
i mean , i don &apos;t know .
i liked her .
but i only knew her a few weeks .
we used to come here .
she made me feel strong .
what ?
nothing , i just ...
i see this stuff all the time .
you know , it &apos;s the strongest @-@ seeming people ,
the rock everyone leans on , but at home ...
no , she was strong .
she did not take any shit .
except from her ex @-@ boyfriend , right ?
no , he attacked her and she left .
yeah , the last time .
but there are a ton of domestic abuse calls on her file .
and again , i didn &apos;t know your friend ,
but , like i said , i see it all the time .
these guys , they have a way of getting under a girl &apos;s skin
and they can &apos;t shake &apos; em .
this guy is a real piece of shit , though .
and i &apos;ll tell you something , i &apos;d be very surprised if it wasn &apos;t him .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m ... i shouldn &apos;t ...
i can &apos;t really discuss any details . you understand ?
listen , thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me .
i appreciate it , and i &apos;m really sorry about your friend , i am .
i will do everything i can to bring her some justice .
i promise you .
thanks .
mcdylan .
you don &apos;t bring her justice . you bring it to him .
it &apos;s sweet , yo .
that &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna be .
well , if it isn &apos;t my favorite damsel in distress .
where &apos;s your dyke in shining armor tonight ?
what &apos;s the matter , sweetie ? she leave you for a real man ?
don &apos;t worry , i got what you need .
chief will take care of you .
you don &apos;t need that dyke bitch .
what ? thinking about it , baby ?
we got her all scared .
i don &apos;t know if she was weak and just very good at hiding it
or if she was outmaneuvered .
that &apos;s an interesting choice of word .
what do you mean by that ?
just that maybe things didn &apos;t go as she planned .
well , what do you think she had planned ?
i don &apos;t know .
not being dead .
she wasn &apos;t weak .
a history of abuse doesn &apos;t mean she was some fucking loser
who brought it on herself .
then what do you think it means ?
hey !
why the fuck are you always lurking out here ?
i &apos;m just walking to my desk . what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing .
wow .
he walked ? how is it that he walked ?
he &apos;s fucking guilty . you said so yourself .
okay , okay , listen . i &apos;m really sorry , okay ?
these things are complicated
and unfortunately the good guys don &apos;t always get to win .
who are the good guys ? you ?
i &apos;m not a lawyer . i &apos;m not the da .
so it &apos;s her own fault she was killed
because she was weak or scared or stupid ?
i don &apos;t know what happened . i don &apos;t .
i am truly sorry , okay ?
i know there &apos;s nothing i can say to make that any better .
i don &apos;t want you to say something . i want you to do something .
look , what can i do , angela ?
there is a system in place , okay ?
and most of the time it actually works .
for who ? not for rape victims .
not for my dead friend marla .
listen , you think he did it . i think he did it .
but there is a burden of proof here .
and you want that , do you understand ?
otherwise someone could just point their finger at you
and send you to jail because they feel like it .
he &apos;s guilty .
what do you want me to say ?
they didn &apos;t fucking prove it .
you didn &apos;t fucking prove it .
okay , i didn &apos;t prove it .
he rapes and murders my friend and you just let him walk away .
not wearing a cape and a utility belt .
i &apos;m a cop . i did my job .
it &apos;s not all up to me .
yeah ? well , keep up the good work .
angela .
angela !
deep !
deep , deep , deep , deep !
where &apos;s all the hot girls up in this joint , man ?
there &apos;s a handful .
hey .
where you going ?
hey , come on . slow down .
what do you want ?
i saw you looking at me .
so ? i look at a lot of people .
i know you &apos;re interested .
i &apos;m not interested . i want to be very clear with you .
i don &apos;t want your attention .
i want you to walk away and leave me alone .
hey , come on .
yeah .
no .
i said no .
come on . you know you want to feel it .
what , your pathetic little excuse for a cock ?
i thought that was your clitoris .
is that all you got , pussy ?
you hit like a girl .
yeah ?
you think you &apos;re funny , you prick @-@ tease cunt ?
come on now , smart mouth , do something useful with it .
you know you like it rough .
no teeth , showhorse .
no teeth .
that &apos;s it . not just the tip , sweetie .
just the tip , sweetie .
this is for marla , showhorse .
it &apos;s like a switch gets thrown. it just comes out in a rush .
and what is it that makes you so angry ?
because it just keeps happening .
people are such animals .
only they &apos;re even worse
because an animal doesn &apos;t relish in the pain it causes .
an animal doesn &apos;t get sadistic pleasure from torturing others .
only humans are that cruel .
you &apos;re human .
do you get sadistic pleasure from committing acts of cruelty ?
fuck yeah , i do .
sometimes .
yo , angela . angela .
there &apos;s a detective here to see you .
is everything okay ?
no .
i &apos;ve really got a lot of work to do . can we play cops and robbers later ?
where were you on tuesday night ?
is this official police business or are you stalking me ?
marla &apos;s ex @-@ boyfriend was murdered on tuesday .
somebody beat him to death with a crowbar ,
amongst other things .
so what are you saying ? you think i did it ?
no , no .
but bolton &apos;s definitely gonna want to talk to you .
who &apos;s bolton ?
lead homicide .
it &apos;s her investigation .
what do i have to do with anything ?
well , you did come on pretty strong when he got out ,
right ? so ...
so now i &apos;m a murder suspect ?
she &apos;s gonna want to talk to all marla &apos;s friends .
i barely knew her .
well , she didn &apos;t have very many friends outside of group , so ...
she didn &apos;t have any friends in group .
she hated everybody .
except you .
look , you said yourself that this guy is a scumbag .
i mean , maybe it has nothing to do with marla at all .
no , the nature of the crime suggests otherwise .
so what ? i mean , he was murdered .
so was my friend . and if there &apos;s no justice for her ,
then why should there be any for him ?
he was a piece of shit .
and to be honest , i &apos;m glad that somebody killed him .
well , that &apos;s exactly what you don &apos;t want to say in this situation , okay ?
god damn it , you &apos;re more interested in catching his killer
than you are in punishing hers .
listen , you have to calm down , okay ?
or bolton is gonna have a field day with you , trust me .
okay ?
thank you for telling me . i appreciate it .
but , you know , if i &apos;m not under arrest ,
then i really need to get back to my shitty job .
hey , angela , look .
for what it &apos;s worth , i am sorry you &apos;re mixed up in all of this , okay ?
you should really leave the murder investigations
to the homicide detectives .
i can &apos;t go back there .
i don &apos;t know where to go .
i don &apos;t know what to do , but ...
i can &apos;t take it anymore .
you know , she pretends like she can &apos;t hear it , but ...
it hurts .
he really hurts me .
and ...
i think he likes it .
enough , enough , stop .
cassie , i &apos;m sorry . i just--i can &apos;t listen to this anymore .
it &apos;s too awful .
it &apos;s got to stop !
somebody
somebody needs to stop this horrific man .
he must be stopped and he must be punished .
truly punished . no . no , lynne , no .
someone should hurt him . he should hurt .
he should ...
he should be anally violated with a metal pipe .
no , somebody should do something .
somebody should do something !
sorry , we &apos;re closed for the night .
very sorry .
i hate to bother you ,
but i &apos;ve been back and forth like three times
and i just can &apos;t find this address .
the buildings don &apos;t have numbers .
yeah , yeah , it &apos;s tricky around here .
sweetie , this is ... this is close .
it &apos;s just a few blocks that way .
that &apos;s what i thought , but i just keep going back and forth .
you know , this isn &apos;t the best neighborhood
and this isn &apos;t far .
what if i walk you ?
that would be great .
okay ? okay-
let &apos;s go .
well , this is the address .
i don &apos;t like the looks of it .
me neither .
maybe i should come in with you .
hello .
weird place .
i like it .
yeah ?
want to play ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
you don &apos;t like me , daddy ?
oh , no , i like you just fine .
i &apos;m not too grown up , am i , daddy ?
i &apos;m a bad little girl .
daddy .
sure you can get it up for someone over 17 ?
we told you we &apos;d be watching .
what ?
help . help !
please , somebody help me !
god ! help !
you &apos;re awake .
who are you ?
what are you ... what are you doing ?
come on , let me out of this chair , you fucking bitch .
god damn it , get me out of this chair .
what ... what is that ?
what are you ... what are you gonna do with that ?
i &apos;m gonna educate you with it .
you should know how it feels to be raped
over and over again .
i didn &apos;t do anything to cassie .
cassie ?
i didn &apos;t say a name .
is there something you want to tell me ?
she-
we had trouble , she and i , but it ...
it &apos;s better now .
did you pose for cassie ?
please .
do what you made cassie do .
come on .
pucker up .
you suck at oral , ron .
oh , god .
oh , god .
please .
please , i need a doctor .
not for very much longer .
i &apos;m sorry .
i have a ... god , i have a family .
don &apos;t you dare try and use that .
please .
i &apos;m begging you .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry !
yes , you will be .
you don &apos;t deserve the lubricant ,
but it just won &apos;t go in otherwise .
oh , god , please don &apos;t . please .
please don &apos;t . please , please . i &apos;ll do anything you want .
please , just tell me what you want me to do .
that &apos;s a tough one , ron .
&apos;cause what i want you to do is suffer .
oh , no ! i &apos;m begging you .
i &apos;m ... oh ! oh ! oh , god !
oh , god !
oh , take it out ! take it out !
take it out , please ! please , please take it ...
out ? it &apos;s barely even in there .
we have a long ways to go .
no ! no !
oh , god !
hold still .
oh , fuck .
it &apos;s hard to hit when it &apos;s wiggling like that .
no , no ! no ,
forgive me , father ,
for i don &apos;t give a shit .
do you even want forgiveness ?
only people who are sorry can be forgiven .
are you sorry ?
don &apos;t you think that if you get even with somebody ,
then they have to get even with you and the problem perpetuates itself ?
not always .
like when ?
do you have any remorse for what you &apos;ve done ?
why should i ?
have you considered that forgiveness might be a way
for you to release some of the anger that you &apos;ve been carrying around ?
so am i forgiven ?
do you forgive yourself ?
you &apos;re not responsible for what happened to you .
some people do bad things . they make bad decisions .
maybe somebody did bad things to them .
but the only way out is forgiveness .
i &apos;ll never forgive them .
they deserved to be punished .
but does that really help you heal ?
maybe not , but at least they got what they deserved .
do you think you deserve to be punished ?
should we wait for lynne or just start without her ?
everyone , i &apos;m sorry for the intrusion ,
but this is the police .
you don &apos;t say .
i &apos;m detective glenn bolton . this is homer ,
and mcdylan i guess you &apos;ve already all met .
we &apos;d like to ask you all some questions .
jesus .
you must be mr. kosca .
it &apos;s pronounced &quot; koza . &quot;
why don &apos;t we start with you ?
can we get a couple chairs ? just set them aside
so we can speak to mr. kosca .
&quot; koza . &quot;
and if this has anything to do with marla finch ,
i hardly knew the woman , okay ?
so why don &apos;t you just leave me out of this ?
you know ron merrick ?
i most certainly do not .
oh , i think you do . you threatened him the other night .
i did no such thing .
right here in group .
something about a pipe .
mmm , does that ring any bells , mr. kosca ?
&quot; koza ! &quot; it &apos;s &quot; koza . &quot;
oscar .
hey , remember me ? i &apos;m detective mcdylan .
i &apos;m not delusional , detective . i know who you are .
you don &apos;t have to handle me .
okay , what about cassie ?
you remember cassie from group here ?
huh ? cassie &apos;s stepfather ron merrick was murdered .
now that &apos;s three murders with ties to this group .
marla , her ex @-@ boyfriend , and now cassie &apos;s step ...
i didn &apos;t ... come ... guys , come on .
i come to group because it &apos;s supposed to be a safe place to share things .
hey , listen , all we &apos;re asking
is that you consider us just new members of the group .
just for tonight , okay ?
maybe we can find out something that might be helpful .
we might not find anything , but we &apos;ll never know if we don &apos;t ask .
all right ?
now that &apos;s three murders , guys . we have to be here .
we have to talk to everybody . you understand that , right ?
i mean , you &apos;d want that .
you don &apos;t want us to make any mistakes .
right ?
you prick . how dare you ?
now ? now you &apos;re supposed to be all caring for us ?
you know what ?
i think we &apos;ll have a little more privacy down at the station .
you can share with all of us downtown , mr. kosca .
get your hands off . get your hands off of me .
get your hands off me !
well , that was real subtle . you handled that very well .
bring &apos; em all in .
what ?
front desk , please hold .
hey , what &apos;s going on with oscar ?
oscar is spending the night with us .
you don &apos;t really think he killed cassie &apos;s stepdad .
he &apos;s not capable of something like that .
well , maybe you don &apos;t know people as well as you think you do .
he &apos;s got a history of making threats , did you know that ?
the accused in his daughter &apos;s case , the da , the lead investigator .
these are the kinds of threats people remember , too .
did he actually do any of it ?
has oscar actually hurt anybody ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out , okay ?
so if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m gonna get back to my shitty job .
he &apos; !
you all right ?
do you want to talk about it ?
well , if you change your mind , i &apos;m a good listener .
thanks . it &apos;s all right .
okay .
oscar .
what are you doing here ?
i just wanted to make sure you were okay .
do you have a few minutes ?
i read about your daughter &apos;s case .
they really botched it .
it &apos;s bureaucracy .
all these functionaries
who only know how to push paper around .
when the facts don &apos;t match up with the paperwork ,
they discount the facts .
they &quot; lost &quot; his dna , so he didn &apos;t rape my daughter .
yeah .
i bet his high @-@ priced lawyer paid someone to lose it .
they couldn &apos;t move forward without it ?
no , without physical evidence , it &apos;s her word against his .
and they made her out to ...
to look like a slut .
and it devastated her . it just ruined her .
and all this time , knowing this guy watson is still out there .
why are you suddenly so interested ?
because i know how your daughter felt .
hopeless .
one of the guys who raped me was a cop .
you never talk in group . you never say anything .
there were five of them .
i thought the sheriff would protect me .
i was wrong .
were they caught ?
they weren &apos;t arrested , if that &apos;s what you mean .
you know , you tell your kids
to trust the authorities , right ?
call 911 , call the cops .
emma didn &apos;t want to do it . i had to convince her to do it .
i told her , &quot; you &apos;ve got to do this .
you &apos;ve got to report this guy . he &apos;s just gonna do it to somebody else . &quot;
but the day that this guy walked ,
i &apos;ll never forget the expression on her face ,
the disappointment that she had in me .
not in the cops , not in the lawyers , but in me .
because i told her to do it .
i let her down .
i think justice has a way of finding people .
yeah , well , i &apos;ve given up on justice .
how did her rapist get a restraining order against you ?
i thought if he saw my face
that he wouldn &apos;t forget her .
that maybe he would confess .
he owned this gym . that &apos;s where it happened .
so i went there every day
and i talked to everybody who went in and out of that place
and i wanted them to know what he did .
so what does he do ?
he turns around and he sues me for libel
and gets a restraining order against me .
he sold that gym , but he &apos;s still a fucking trainer .
some sleazy place on 17th street .
they made it sound like you were dangerous .
come on , look at me .
compared to watson , that creature .
but i should have done something .
i should have done something to make things right .
even if it meant me going to jail for the rest of my life ,
i should have done something .
but you &apos;re not talking about punishment ,
you &apos;re talking about vengeance .
taking the law into your own hands .
i &apos;d rather that than leave it in nobody &apos;s ,
which is where it is now .
you believe that ?
don &apos;t you ?
set aside for a moment the countless rapists
who go unpunished ,
what about people like cassie &apos;s mom ?
serving her daughter up to a monster .
she gets a big pass .
she &apos;s not even in the system .
who &apos;s gonna make her pay for what she did ?
that &apos;s not your job .
don &apos;t you think she &apos;s been affected by her decisions ?
no . that &apos;s bullshit .
i saw her and she looked fine to me .
everybody has their own problems , their own destiny .
you need to worry about your choices and actions .
i thought that was your job .
you know what i &apos;m hearing ?
is that after everything you &apos;ve been through ,
you have essentially learned nothing .
no .
i &apos;ve learned a lot .
why are you following me ?
who hired you ?
fuck you .
you fucked with the wrong guy .
you &apos;re not gonna like this .
you fucked up , you stupid cunt .
this is gonna hurt a lot .
police !
what the fuck is this ?
get your hands on your fucking head right now .
you following me ?
hands on your head , get on the ground now .
is this cooze bait , is that it ? entrapment .
put your hands on your head and get on the fucking ground now .
fuck you , pig
hey , hey , hey
okay , okay ! !
angela , can you hear me ?
okay , okay . you &apos;re okay .
you &apos;re okay . call a fucking ambulance .
you all right ? yeah ?
you up for a few questions ?
sure .
great .
okay .
let &apos;s see .
the knife was yours , right ?
yes .
the taser i &apos;m not sure about
because it had your fingerprints on it as well as his .
it &apos;s mine . i was raped .
of course i don &apos;t go out without defensive weapons .
naturally .
and now , why were you in that part of town ?
i was looking at a gym on 17th .
on 17th .
so you were eight blocks north of there .
i got lost going home .
thought someone was following me .
guess i panicked .
why not a gym in your own neighborhood ?
can &apos;t afford it .
all right , well , the gym explains the change of clothes .
you found my bag , good .
but not the lighter fluid .
i was returning it .
to whom ?
the store .
it was the wrong kind .
for what ?
a lighter . started smoking again .
it was used .
i opened it before i realized .
what store ?
pharmacy on 15th .
where was the receipt ?
in the bag .
and the man ? who was he to you ?
the man who attacked me .
hmm .
so who &apos;s the little girl in the picture ?
it &apos;s just a girl .
just a girl whose picture you wear around your neck ?
it reminds me of something .
oh ? what ?
innocence .
you need to be reminded of that ?
i know who she is .
chastity starch .
her father was a louisiana sheriff .
killed in a murder @-@ suicide
with some inbred redneck buddies of his .
you know , there was one missing piece .
someone the police wanted to talk to .
jennifer hills .
why &apos;d you change your name ?
i didn &apos;t want to be jennifer hills anymore .
all right ,
let &apos;s just cut the shit , okay ?
we &apos;ve got you , you understand ?
do you understand ?
see , this , all this , it &apos;s just a process .
you know , the system .
but it &apos;s done .
we &apos;re not idiots , ms. hills .
and , you know , it &apos;s actually a very easy storyline to follow .
you become buddy @-@ buddy with marla finch from group
and , you know , yes , that was a terrible ,
terrible thing that happened to her .
then the boyfriend walks
and you snap .
i understand that . i honestly do .
and there are some days , whew , i want to do the exact same thing .
and then that girl , what was her name ?
cassie . jesus .
i can &apos;t imagine what it was like sitting there
listening to that little girl talk about being raped
by her stepfather and not wanting to shove a pipe up that guy &apos;s ass .
that &apos;s actually what your buddy oscar suggested doing , right ?
that exact same thing , huh ?
you know what ?
hmm ?
now that i think about it ...
lynne seemed especially upset about it all .
have you looked into her whereabouts ?
yeah , well , we didn &apos;t find lynne
in a fight to the death with cole watson .
who &apos;s cole watson ?
man , don &apos;t kid yourself , jennifer .
we &apos;re looking at full @-@ blown premeditated murder .
that guy attacked me .
and if you hadn &apos;t shot him dead , he would have killed me .
i &apos;m guessing they &apos;re not gonna charge you because you &apos;re cops .
that &apos;s funny .
you should hold on to your sense of humor .
you &apos;re gonna need it .
do i get a lawyer ?
or is that just for people who you haven &apos;t already decided are guilty ?
she wants to make her phone call .
detective mcdylan ...
detective mcdylan !
i did it .
oh , my god !
everybody get back .
i killed them all .
jesus christ .
no !
i killed them all .
i did it .
call an ambulance .
call an ambulance now !
i murdered them . i murdered them .
i murdered them .
hey , angela . i &apos;ll give you a ride .
go fuck yourself .
i &apos;m sorry about oscar , okay ?
i &apos;m sure you are .
just let me give you a ride . i &apos;m trying to help you out here .
like you care !
you fuckers are no better than the rapists .
let me ask you something .
did you spend this much time investigating maria &apos;s ex ?
or were you saving that all for me ?
honestly , if i had any idea how incompetent the police were ,
i would have spent my life hiding in fear .
angela , don &apos;t leave town .
i &apos;m serious . you skip bail , you &apos;re fucked .
i &apos;m fucked already .
so are we gonna talk about it ?
what &apos;s there to talk about ?
are you gonna tell me
that you ran into a door or fell down the stairs ?
yeah .
like you want to hear the truth .
try me .
the truth is you want justice , you take it for yourself .
no one can give it to you .
is that how that happened ?
you &apos;re damn right it is .
maybe you were able to exact some justice ,
but it doesn &apos;t seem to have brought you any peace .
i &apos;m not finished yet .
angela .
man , is that you ?
buy me a drink .
i think you &apos;ve already had a few .
let me give you a ride home .
i &apos;ll bet you want to give me a ride .
i &apos;m sorry , excuse me ?
you can drop the polite act .
come on , angela . man , let me ...
let me just take you home .
i thought you wanted to fuck me .
whoa , hey , i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know ... what is this ?
what do you want it to be ?
angela , come on , you are completely freaking me out right now , okay ?
look , i &apos;m gonna go . you gonna be okay if i go ?
do you think i need a cock to protect me ?
yo , is that a knife ?
what , this ?
yo .
no , what the ... ?
angela , what is wrong with you ?
hey , honey .
showing it off , huh ?
that &apos;s real nice .
let me see what you &apos;re working with .
mm , such a sweet ass .
though if you &apos;re gonna show it off like that ,
you ought to let me have some .
is that how it works ?
do i have to wear a sheet to keep you from raping me ?
what the fuck ? nobody raping anybody .
hey , what happened to your face ?
i fell in love .
what ?
what &apos;s the matter ? don &apos;t you like me anymore ?
bitch , you better back the fuck up .
come on , chief . i thought you had something
you wanted to show me .
come on , you gonna turn down a little blow job ?
what ? what the ... come on .
you serious ?
why don &apos;t you come over here ?
find out for yourself , tough guy .
wait , what ?
right here in the middle of the park ?
it &apos;s not gonna take that long .
shit , i mean ...
oh , shit .
oh , your foreplay needs work .
hey !
hey , hey .
stop right there .
okay . okay .
take one step and i &apos;ll slit his fucking throat .
hey , angela , put the knife down and get off him , okay ?
you gonna read me my rights ?
you &apos;re okay . just put the knife down , okay ?
i have the right to remain silent .
angela .
anything i say ... -put the weapon down .
... can and will be ... -angela , don &apos;t !
... used against me .
time &apos;s up .
so soon ?
feels like we were just getting started .
and yet it &apos;s been two years . you &apos;re out of here friday .
how about you try to keep out of trouble ?
you think you can go three days without fighting ?
maybe . but if somebody steps up ...
well , you have a choice in how you react .
you don &apos;t always have to retaliate .
predators and prey , doc .
all right , a condition of your probation
is that you continue therapy , and i hope that you will try
finding a new group .
i know you had a bad experience ,
but can you just set down the attitude for an hour
and try to stay open ?
yeah .
all right . i will .
really ? that &apos;s great .
you know , you can make better choices for yourself .
i worry about you .
i know you do . and i appreciate it .
okay , then .
you can wait for me outside , please .
wait for me outside .
back up , bitch .
stop it !
