red one , pilgrim seems to be
experiencing a malfunction with its spr collector .
please assess .
copy that , mission control .
what is this , glitch number 81 ?
not that anyone &apos;s counting up here .
mission control thought math wasn &apos;t your strong suit . over .
i could say the same about the guys
that built this bucket of bolts .
you guys find this thing in a cereal box ?
i think you &apos;re hurting pilgrim &apos;s feelings , red one .
red one , you have a situation 90 degrees to your left ,
50 meters out . please assess .
what the hell ?
we &apos;ve got a civilian .
help me .
he just collapsed .
what is your status ?
red one , what is your status ?
this guy &apos;s not breathing !
come on . breathe . breathe .
come on .
red one , come in !
breathe .
this is depressing .
well , that &apos;s what happens when you live on an island
and you leave things to the last minute--
you get slim pickings , danny .
that &apos;s very helpful . thank you .
i &apos;m just saying ,
it &apos;s two days before christmas-- all the good trees are gone .
you know what , you may want to think about going artificial .
no , no , no . the williams family does not do fake trees , okay ?
this .
look at that .
this is beautiful . this i can do .
hey . how you doing ?
how you guys doing ? she &apos;s a beauty , isn &apos;t she ?
yeah .
beautiful .
oh , that is a colorado blue spruce .
fresh in from lana &apos;i .
now , that ... is the cadillac of christmas trees .
all right . how much , uh , for the cadillac of christmas trees ?
well , today it &apos;s going for
the bargain @-@ basement price of just $ 750 .
and i &apos;ll throw in the tie @-@ downs for you .
$ 750 ? what are you , nuts ?
steve , he &apos;s trying to stick me up . arrest this guy .
come on-- $ 750 .
what are you guys , cops ?
yeah , we &apos;re cops . five @-@ o.
i &apos;ll knock a hundred bucks off for you .
no , that &apos;s still out of my price range .
hey , not to worry . listen ,
for the budget @-@ conscious , i got just the thing .
there you go .
what do i look like , charlie brown ?
this is a youthful spruce .
it &apos;s a depressing twig that fell off the expensive tree .
what is this ? you shouldn &apos;t even sell these trees .
well , these are my best offerings here .
you &apos;re more than welcome to try another lot .
you know what ?
listen , forget this guy-- i got a better idea .
thank you very much .
i &apos;ll give you $ 300 for that tree .
save your money . i &apos;ve got you covered .
whoa . hey , don &apos;t do it !
wait ! whoa , wait !
huh ?
i changed my mind again .
i can &apos;t hear you .
i said i ... i don &apos;t think this is a good idea .
why would you say something like that ?
well , because &quot; this is a protected forest preserve . &quot;
right ? because &quot; removing trees is strictly prohibited . &quot;
because &quot; violators will be punished to the full ex ... &quot;
i &apos;m just reading from the big sign that we saw when we got here .
that sign that says things you should not do . that one .
okay ?
it &apos;s christmas , danny--
all right , you and gracie need a tree .
you want a tree ?
i do . i did . i want a tree , but not like this .
$ 750 is insane for a tree .
and every other lot is sold out .
besides , look around-- what do you see here ?
what do you see here ?
trees .
lots and lots and lots of trees .
yeah .
there &apos;s thousands of trees here .
they &apos;re not gonna miss one .
you know what i mean ?
all right ?
wait , wait , wait . wait ! wait !
i cannot believe you made me an accomplice to a crime .
a victimless crime .
the evidence to which is strapped to the roof of my car right now .
danny , no one &apos;s gonna know where this tree came from , all right ?
i &apos;m gonna know where the tree came from , okay ?
that &apos;s all i meant is , every time i look at it ,
i &apos;m gonna think how we broke the law to get it .
that &apos;s it . you tainted christmas .
you know what you are ?
annoyed with this conversation .
you are a ruiner of christmas .
you are a scrooge .
bah . humbug .
okay ? all right .
are you gonna answer it ?
what am i , your valet service ? it &apos;s your phone .
no , i got a meeting with the governor today .
you know that . if it &apos;s a case , it &apos;s for you .
okay , do me a favor ,
when you see the governor , make sure you tell him that you
spent the morning vandalizing his beautiful island ,
okay ?
oh , my god .
please hold for mr. malcontent . thank you .
detective alawa ?
yes , sir .
hey . detective williams .
dr. bergman . captain grover .
thanks for flying over .
where &apos;s the body ?
it &apos;s this way .
he just stumbled into the test area and collapsed .
one of the members of the hi @-@ seas group tried to resuscitate him ,
but he was dead by the time paramedics arrived .
what &apos;s the hi @-@ seas ?
oh , i can field this one , detective .
hi @-@ seas is the hawaii space exploration analog and simulation .
this rocky terrain here is very similar
to the surface you would find on mars ,
so they and other aerospace programs
have staged training simulations here for many years .
and they &apos;re taking this breach of security seriously .
which is why you were asked to come out here .
you get an i.d. on the vic ?
no wallet .
and no one at the facility recognizes him .
my guys are running prints now .
detective , we need to set up a search perimeter .
let &apos;s look for fresh tire tracks ,
maybe an abandoned vehicle ,
&apos;cause there &apos;s no way
this guy just wandered up here on foot .
you got it .
thanks , detective .
what are you doing here ?
well , i &apos;m doing what &apos;s called a preliminary examination .
i find it &apos;s sometimes useful in determining the cause of death .
max , want to introduce us to your friend here ?
we &apos;re not friends .
we &apos;re not friends .
gentlemen ,
this is dr. sanjeet dhawan , the hawai &apos;i island m.e.
we did our anatomical pathology residency together .
it &apos;s a pleasure , gents .
so , i @-@ i &apos;m a little confused .
how is it that the two of you are not friends ?
it &apos;s complicated .
and i don &apos;t understand why dr. dhawan is here
in the first place considering the governor assigned five @-@ o
to investigate this incident .
while you may have jurisdiction here , dr. bergman ,
there &apos;s only one m.e. office on this island .
mine .
and if you &apos;re gonna be using it in this case ,
i &apos;m gonna have to insist on being involved .
sounds great to me . good to you ?
yeah . fantastic . any objections ?
multiple . firstly ... - zip it , please , max .
we got it .
please , continue .
well , i was just getting started ,
but my initial thought was that the victim was suffering
from high @-@ altitude pulmonary edema due to the elevation ,
but then due to the lack of grayness or blue in the limbs ,
i was able to rule that out .
actually , you can rule out all natural causes .
i believe this man was poisoned .
really ? how do you know that ?
well ... pinpoint pupils is a telltale sign that he was poisoned .
i &apos;m surprised you missed this , sanjeet .
i didn &apos;t miss anything .
like i said , i was just getting started .
also , pinpoints can often suggest an opiate overdose .
unlike some m.e. &apos; s , i don &apos;t like to speculate
until all the facts are in .
there &apos;s two of &apos; em .
yeah .
listen , i got an idea .
what say the two of you gentlemen
get this body over to the morgue .
that way you can settle whatever this is over there .
oh ... it is on .
like wrath of khan .
you know , um , i say this often around max ,
but that was very , uh , strange .
no luck with id , detective .
prints didn &apos;t get a match on afis .
well , the guy is dressed like a cowboy .
there &apos;s a ton of ranches on this island .
maybe he belongs to one of &apos; em ?
you know , it &apos;s possible .
the closest ranch is 15 miles away .
i guess the question is , how does a cowboy ...
end up dead on mars ?
what are you doing ?
my job .
you should try it sometime .
no , i mean why are you fixating on
old contusions that are clearly unrelated to the cause of death ?
that &apos;s right . walk away .
let the adults do their work .
i don &apos;t know how you put up with him .
okay , max , i want to know .
what is it between you two ? tell me .
well , it &apos;s private .
and to discuss this in a professional environment
is highly inappropriate .
i don &apos;t care .
fine , if you must know ,
it was over a certain woman .
enough said .
what &apos;s going on with our john doe ?
well ... - to begin with ,
the autopsy confirmed my suspicions .
the cod was indeed poisoning .
what kind of poison ?
we don &apos;t know yet .
the initial tox screen came back negative .
but we were able to narrow down the spectrum of ...
hold on . &quot; we &quot; ?
excuse me .
dr. dhawan
was able to narrow down the spectrum of possible poisons .
i discovered some excess substances in the victim &apos;s lungs .
there &apos;s only a few poisons that could cause that result .
of course , additional tests will need to be performed to
determine which was the exact poison utilized to kill our victim .
all early indications point to tcvp .
or perhaps a couple dozen other substances .
okay , okay , okay . do we at least know
how this mystery poison entered this gentleman &apos;s body ?
due to the lack of injection marks on the victim &apos;s body
and any indication that it was absorbed through the skin ,
i can say with confidence it was likely ingested .
so the killer spiked something that he ate ?
or drank .
we &apos;ll know more once we analyze his stomach contents .
with any luck , we &apos;ll find some traces of the poison .
and even if we don &apos;t ,
knowing the victim &apos;s last meal
could lead to some valuable information ,
possibly leading to an id .
well , gentlemen , i &apos;m sure our good doctor means well .
however , analyzing the stomach contents could take hours .
i , on the other hand ,
already have an idea who our victim is .
well , do you have his name ?
well , something close enough .
gentlemen ,
please note which part of the rider &apos;s body is utilized the most .
the wrist , the elbows , the shoulders ,
the hips and the groin .
our john doe , at one time or another ,
had suffered fractures in all of these parts .
furthermore , i found traces of rosin on his hands .
rosin is commonly used on a rider &apos;s glove
to enhance the bull rope grip .
all of these observations lead to an obvious conclusion ,
that ...
the guy was a bull rider .
that &apos;s right , lift it and go .
you gotta hang on to get this tram on board .
let &apos;s cheer for him , folks .
he &apos;s got seconds left on the clock .
let &apos;s hear it for st. nick , everybody .
the old man &apos;s still got it .
i got to say , i &apos;m a little bummed i didn &apos;t get to see mars .
then you should &apos;ve taken the earlier flight .
you didn &apos;t miss anything . trust me .
wow , this really brings back some memories .
yeah ?
yeah , my dad used to take us to the rodeo
when i was a kid whenever it came into town .
used to sit right behind the bucking chutes .
get to see the bulls up close .
some of the paniolos even taught me
how to handle a rope .
i got to say , i don &apos;t see the appeal .
that &apos;s just me , personally , though , you know ?
can i help you , officers ?
uh , yeah .
we &apos;re with five @-@ o. um , who &apos;s , uh ...
who &apos;s in charge around here ?
looking at &apos; em . al mokuau .
i organized today &apos;s event .
how you doing ?
good to meet you .
this is jill kuikahi . she manages all our riders .
hi . how do you do ?
hi .
what can we do for you ?
do you know this man ?
oh , my god .
that &apos;s keone maka .
he &apos;s one of our riders . what @-@ what happened ?
he was found dead this morning up on mauna loa .
i can &apos;t believe this .
do you have , uh ...
uh , any idea why he might have been up there ?
no .
keone &apos;s day job was delivering hay and feed
to ranches on the island .
most of his stops were made in the early morning .
doesn &apos;t make any sense he &apos;d be anywhere near mauna loa .
can you tell us how he died ?
all indications point to him being poisoned .
you &apos;re saying keone was murdered ?
yeah .
can you think of anyone who may have wanted to hurt him ?
luke .
luke ? okay . who &apos;s , uh ... who &apos;s luke ?
luke pakele .
he &apos;s one of the other riders .
keone came forward and accused luke of cheating .
claimed that luke was injecting bulls with steroids .
injecting bulls with steroids .
why would he do that ?
in bull riding , half your score is based upon
how long you stay on the bull .
the other half is how much it bucks .
a more aggressive bull means more points for the rider .
exactly .
we took the accusation seriously ,
so we checked out luke &apos;s bull .
sure enough , keone was right .
the bull tested positive for steroids .
okay . then what happened ?
we fired luke the next day .
he also had to forfeit some of his prize money .
i can &apos;t imagine luke was too happy about that .
no , ma &apos;am .
so , i ran the name luke pakele .
the guy &apos;s been busted twice for cattle rustling .
got a last known address ?
yeah , he lives in the kalapana lava gardens .
i &apos;m texting you the exact address right now .
lava gardens ? that like , uh , molten lava ?
you &apos;re gonna love it .
all right , i &apos;m gonna get a csu team over to keone &apos;s house .
if luke is our guy ,
he could &apos;ve poisoned something in keone &apos;s house .
maybe we &apos;ll find out what it is .
all right . good luck .
mahalo , cuz .
hey , pua . howzit ?
lieutenant kelly .
can i help you with something ?
actually , i &apos;m looking for commander mcgarrett
and detective williams .
ah , you &apos;re out of luck .
commander mcgarrett &apos;s in meetings with the governor ,
and detective williams is on hawai &apos;i island working a case .
unavailable . interesting .
do you happen to know where they were this morning ?
actually , no , pua . i don &apos;t keep tabs on &apos; em .
what &apos;s this about ?
i &apos;m not at liberty to say . sorry .
official police business .
pua , i am police .
please have commander mcgarrett
and detective williams contact me as soon as they can .
seriously ?
thank you for your time and your cooperation . aloha .
aloha .
i don &apos;t get it .
why would anybody on the planet want to live out here ?
well , some people crave a little adventure .
plus , the real estate &apos;s cheap .
oh . make sense .
luke ? luke pakele ?
five @-@ o. we need to talk .
where is he running to ?
nice roping , cowgirl .
not even my best time .
all right , luke , come on . talk to me .
you go from , uh , stealing cattle to killing cowboys ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
i never killed no cowboy .
okay , well , look , i , uh ...
i got , uh , one cowboy in the morgue ,
and you &apos;re the only one with motive to put him there .
keone &apos;s dead ?
he was poisoned .
and you think i did it ?
the guy got you fired .
cost you a lot of money .
i imagine it made you pretty angry .
yeah , i was pissed .
but i didn &apos;t off the guy .
okay , then why &apos;d you run when we showed up ?
pretty sure she &apos;s about to tell you .
so , this guy ,
definitely making santa &apos;s &quot; naughty &quot; list .
stanozolol , oxandrolone , andro .
this is not good , luke .
definitely enough steroids to put you away for a while .
i don &apos;t care about this , okay ?
i really don &apos;t . i want ... i want to know about the murder .
i told you , i didn &apos;t kill him .
hold that thought .
all right , you ready for this ?
we show up at keone &apos;s place only to find out
somebody &apos;s already been here .
i got evidence of forced entry at the front door .
inside the house , the place has been completely tossed ,
and some stuff seems to be missing .
i spoke with the next door neighbor ,
who said she walked by the place this morning .
everything seemed normal .
so this break @-@ in likely happened after the murder .
okay , so luke doses keone ,
and then he comes back to rob him
to make up for some of the money he lost .
that would be a viable theory ,
except for a lot of the valuables are still here .
now , i see that there &apos;s been a computer tower that &apos;s been stolen ,
but they left behind a flat @-@ screen and a stereo .
they also neglected to take a pretty nice camera ,
though it does look like they swiped the memory card .
so it looks like they were after evidence of something .
exactly .
i don &apos;t think this murder was about revenge at all .
well , latest toxicology report is back .
and ?
and you were wrong . again .
our mystery poison is not tcvp .
aren &apos;t you done yet ?
oh , actually , i was , uh , texting captain grover to let him know ,
based on my complete analysis of keone maka &apos;s stomach contents ,
i was able to conclude that the yet @-@ to @-@ be @-@ identified poison
was ingested in liquid form .
so he can instruct all the csu
to ignore any solid foods in the house .
wow . case @-@ breaking discovery .
enjoy your digs , doctor ,
but i am going to be
the one riding off into the sunset with the win .
well , at least i &apos;ll still have janice .
you son of a bitch .
how dare you speak her name .
you stole her from me !
oh , please , she was never yours to steal .
and why are you still angry ?
i &apos;m the one who should be angry .
what ? what gives you the right to be angry ?
well , you told all our friends your side of the story ,
painted me as a villain .
and then they all turned on me .
i became a pariah .
you betrayed my trust !
but for the record , i never told them to freeze you out .
no , but you let it happen .
i don &apos;t get it .
why would this guy be keeping a vial of blood in his fridge ?
i don &apos;t know , but he hid it .
must mean it &apos;s important .
i really wonder
if it has something to do with his murder .
uh , yeah , i hate to even say it ,
but the way this case is going ,
i don &apos;t know if we &apos;re gonna make it home
by christmas morning .
well , that &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m sorry .
are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine . couple days ago ,
i overheard grace talking to one of her friends ,
and i think that the cat is officially out of the bag .
cat &apos;s out of the bag ?
yeah .
you know , i never really got that one .
i mean , who puts a cat in a bag ?
i don &apos;t know .
the point is , i @-@ i think
that she no longer believes , in santa claus .
in fact , i &apos;m pretty sure
she probably hasn &apos;t believed in him for a little while now .
it was inevitable , danny .
yeah . yeah , i know .
but , you know , there &apos;s this very special look
that i get once a year .
you see , i get to see her come out of her room ,
and she has this glow
when she sees those presents
that santa left for her , and i @-@ i just think
that christmas is not gonna be the same without ...
without it , so , there you go .
maybe you &apos;re looking at it all wrong . i mean ,
maybe it &apos;s not so bad .
how is it not so bad ?
well , because now , you don &apos;t have to keep up the charade .
right ? the ruse is over .
look , there &apos;s no more lying , no more hiding the presents ,
no more sneaking around , putting them under the tree .
and the best thing of all is , this year , for the first time ,
you &apos;ll get all the credit for the awesome gifts .
right ?
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t care about the credit ,
though , you know ?
look , all i &apos;m saying--
it &apos;s okay for a kid grace &apos;s age
to not believe in old saint nick .
yeah , i guess you &apos;re right .
maybe i &apos;m just upset that she &apos;s growing up so fast .
danny filled me in on the case earlier .
what &apos;s the latest ?
well , hawaii pd located keone maka &apos;s truck
about a mile from the mars training site .
okay . it looks like he lost control and it went into a ravine .
you know , i &apos;m thinking that the poison must have kicked in
while he was driving .
well , it makes sense .
he gets disoriented , he , he crashes into the ditch ,
and then he goes looking for help on foot .
their csu is processing it now .
meantime , i think i might have a lead .
oh , by the way , pua stopped by .
he was looking for you and danny .
he say why ?
no , but he was acting weird .
hey , what &apos;s up , cuz ?
so , i pulled keone &apos;s phone records ,
and i found something interesting .
in the 48 hours before his death ,
he exchanged nine phone calls with a man
from los angeles by the name of jeff harrison .
now , right after the last call ,
harrison booked a flight from la to kona
that arrived at 1 : 00 a.m. this morning .
okay , let me get this straight .
so , nine phone calls in two days .
then the guy shows up ,
and a couple hours later , keone &apos;s dead ?
what do we know about harrison ?
the guy &apos;s a horse trainer .
no record , but he did end up
in the news last year when his racehorse ,
urban myth , went missing .
i remember this . urban myth .
he was a favorite to win the kentucky derby .
night before the race , horse disappears .
nobody ever heard anything , no ransom demand , nothing .
guys , hold on a second .
i just got a hit back on harrison &apos;s credit card .
looks like he &apos;s staying at a motel in hamakua ,
and he just booked a return flight back to l.a.
that leaves in a few hours .
well , he &apos;s gonna miss that flight .
help !
help me !
help me ! help !
detective williams with five @-@ o.
i &apos;m en route with a possible poison victim .
early 60s , male .
eta-- we &apos;re about three minutes out .
need trauma team standing by .
danny , he &apos;s not gonna make it .
all right , let &apos;s get him inside .
start him on o2 and get a line in .
do we know what kind of poison it was ?
no . we got somebody working on it right now .
well , tell them to work fast .
they need to i.d. that toxin
if we &apos;re gonna save this man &apos;s life .
bag and tag anything harrison could have ingested .
toothpaste , mouthwash , gum , coffee grounds--
take it all .
something in this room was laced with poison .
we need to find it !
now !
max .
smell this .
it could be our delivery system .
smells like liquid nicotine , right ?
it &apos;s faint , but i concur .
we still need to run it to be sure .
liquid nicotine would explain the pinpoints in the eyes .
and the mucus in the lungs .
and it wouldn &apos;t show up in the standard tox screen .
it &apos;s a good catch , sanjeet .
weird . it ... it sounded like i just received a compliment ,
but that &apos;s impossible since
you &apos;re the only other person in the room .
sanjeet , about what happened ...
i shouldn &apos;t have let our friends turn against you .
i didn &apos;t consider the consequences .
i &apos;m sorry .
accepted .
boom . liquid nicotine !
we were right .
no . you were right .
make the call .
we treated harrison with atropine and pralidoxime .
with some time to recover ,
he should be fine , but he was lucky .
liquid nicotine , highly concentrated ,
is extremely toxic .
just a teaspoon could be fatal .
and thanks to e @-@ cigarettes , it &apos;s readily available .
okay , uh , when can we speak to him ?
uh , not for a couple hours at least .
we had to sedate him .
but i &apos;ll let you know when he comes to .
okay . mahalo .
lab report just came in
on that blood from keone &apos;s house .
horse blood .
they said it was drawn no more than a couple of days ago .
okay , wait a minute .
uh , lou , do me a favor .
see if you can get in touch
with the american thoroughbred association .
all right ? they should have dna profiles
on all the professional race horses .
see if they can run that blood
against the profile of urban myth .
okay . what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking that this case
has something to do with that missing horse .
just take your time .
let me know if you recognize anyone .
him ... and him .
are you sure , ma &apos;am ?
100 % .
it was those two haoles .
thank you .
okay , thank you .
you were right . that was the ata .
blood from keone &apos;s-- direct dna match to urban myth .
uh , okay .
that sample was taken a couple of days ago .
that means that horse is on this island .
keone must have come into contact with him ,
and then reached out to harrison
to let him know he found his missing horse .
harrison tells keone
to get a blood sample so they can confirm .
and then whoever has urban myth
realizes that somebody &apos;s onto him ,
and realizes he has to clip &apos; em both .
we got to figure out who &apos;s got that horse .
okay , thing i don &apos;t get is this .
why would you steal a racehorse and not ransom it ?
i mean , it &apos;s not like you can run it anywhere .
no .
but you could put it out to stud , make a lot of money .
okay , so we checked ,
and there are only three stud farms on the entire island .
but one of them , nakata ranch ,
was right on keone &apos;s delivery route .
that must be where he saw urban myth .
okay , what do we know about this place ?
owner &apos;s name is al mokuau .
that &apos;s the guy from the rodeo .
that &apos;s the same guy who tried to
pin this whole thing on luke pakele .
i say we round him up .
what was that , a horse metaphor ?
yes , sir .
hey . where &apos;s mokuau ?
took off about an hour ago .
where &apos;s urban myth ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
your boss-- where was he headed ?
i &apos;m not sure . he was in a pickup ,
with a horse trailer hitched to the back .
he &apos;s getting rid of the evidence .
guys , i tried pinging mokuau &apos;s cell phone ,
but i &apos;m not getting a signal .
think i might know where he is .
hpd just ran mokuau &apos;s financials .
yesterday he rented a backhoe from
a local construction supply company .
this morning , he had it delivered to a property
he owns in waimea .
he &apos;s going to kill and bury that horse .
let &apos;s go .
don &apos;t move .
it &apos;s all right . easy , boy . you &apos;re all right .
turn around .
give me your hands .
can &apos;t even move my arm . i need an ambulance .
yeah ? well , i &apos;d call you one ,
but , you know , the service out here is terrible .
how about you , sis , you got anything ?
half a bar .
i could bleed to death .
yeah , you could .
and after all you &apos;ve done , that &apos;s a real consideration .
wha ... all you got on me
is stolen property
and maybe attempted animal cruelty .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
on the way over here , we got a phone call .
local crime lab-- seems they found a travel mug
inside keone &apos;s truck .
still had some coffee in it .
so they tested the mug and the coffee ,
and guess what they found .
traces of liquid nicotine .
so now we &apos;re thinking that he got dosed
when he came by your ranch this morning .
lab also found a fingerprint on the mug .
and i &apos;m guessing , once you give us yours , it &apos;ll match .
it was a gutsy play . you know , you steal urban myth ,
bringing him way out here , putting him out to stud .
i think it probably would have worked
if keone had not recognized this horse .
he was gonna blow the whistle on you .
and somehow you got wind of it .
and you took him out before he had a chance to .
and then you went over to his place
and discovered he &apos;d already contacted harrison .
so now harrison had to go , too .
keone always went on about how much he loved horse racing .
i saw him on my security feed .
sneaking around , taking pictures of him ...
i knew he recognize urban myth .
why couldn &apos;t he just leave well enough alone ?
no one was looking for that horse anymore .
urban myth got to retire to a big ranch .
while the owners got their insurance payout .
everyone had moved on .
no one cared .
except keone .
urban myth was just a foal
when i started working with him .
i &apos;ve trained a lot of horses over the years , but ...
urban ...
well , let &apos;s just say that
some mean more to you .
hey , boy .
how come you automatically sit in the front ?
well , look , hold on , it &apos;s not automatic .
first of all , i said shotgun . second of all ,
if you &apos;re gonna make a thing about it ,
i &apos;ll sit in the back . i &apos;m being polite .
you can &apos;t ... you &apos;re sitting there last night ,
i got to fold myself up like a pretzel ...

between you two this whole time has been about a , um ...

ah . okay , i &apos;m done .
nice to meet you .
you see , for many years ,
i had been collecting the original
star trek t.o.s. action figures .
and janice would have completed my collection .
and , you know , swiped him in an internet auction .
i should have been the bigger man , but , you know ,
i had a thing for the actress , and in this instance ,
i kind of felt max should have ,
you know , stepped aside , but ...
it &apos;s fine .
you do have a point . i mean ...

no .
i &apos;d understand .
no , no , i insist .
you should have her .
