emma , there is a way to make excalibur whole again .
a spark from mankind &apos;s original fire ,
the flame of prometheus .
its heat forged excalibur .
you know i &apos;m a survivor .
this ring is why .
be careful , emma .
it &apos;s quite an ingenious recipe for a tethering potion .
it can control the world &apos;s greatest wizard .
merlin . how kind of you to come when called .
you lied to him , to david .
it brought me no pleasure .
he &apos;s a good man .
but i must think of my kingdom first .
that &apos;s arthur &apos;s tent .
i &apos;ll go in first .
you two stand guard .
and if our dishonest king should put up a fight ?
we &apos;ll make him wish he hadn &apos;t .
arthur .
? david !
good to see you , my friend .
come , sit . join us .
why don &apos;t you explain why you lied to me ?
why you tried to burn the crimson crown .
so , you found me out .
yeah , i found out ...
friend .
now , that part was real .
ah , it doesn &apos;t matter .
not anymore .
but i want answers . see ...
there was a message in there for merlin .
it said there was only one person
who could destroy the dark one , named nimue .
you tell me who that is .
he &apos;s getting away !
look at that .
seems you brought a hook to a sword fight .
actually , i brought a sword ,
but i seem to have misplaced it . ? - shame .
it &apos;s always the simple mistakes that get us killed .
excalibur .
it &apos;s whole .
yes , it is .
but it &apos;s not going to help you .
this sword ? doesn &apos;t control anyone now .
i suppose i should say &quot; thank you . &quot;
you don &apos;t need to say anything .
just don &apos;t do that again .
i should apologize for what i said that day aboard my ship .
for when you refused to accept me
or when you said you did not love me ?
it &apos;s a bit more complicated than that .
doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;m the dark one .
you &apos;re more than the dark one . you &apos;re still you .
you saved me .
that was emma .
what do you want from me ?
i want to help you .
and i need your help to do it .
who is nimue ,
and how can she defeat the darkness ?
nimue doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
this will all be over tomorrow .
what will be over ? and why do you need that damned sword ?
all this power ,
and you don &apos;t even have the courage to answer
one simple bloody question .
why do you need excalibur ?
i know you &apos;re still in there , emma ,
and i know that despite everything ,
you always have your reasons !
you &apos;re right ! i do !
you want to know ? why i &apos;m doing all of this ?
i &apos;m doing it for you .
mom , did you do it ?
did you find the spark of ...
prometheus , yes .
now we can use it to fix excalibur .
finally some good news .
that &apos;s great , mom .
let &apos;s get that darkness out of you .
yes , let &apos;s . where &apos;s the sword ?
i don &apos;t know .
no one &apos;s come back with it .
really ?
they should &apos;ve been back hours ago .
have you seen merlin ?
i thought he was with you .
he was , but then he vanished . something &apos;s wrong .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re safe here anymore .
granny , let &apos;s close up shop .
one step ahead of you .
henry , lock the front . i got the back .
henry ?
he &apos;ll be fine once we &apos;re done .
i &apos;m sorry for the theatrics .
it &apos;s not usually my style ,
but ... i had to follow orders .
orders ? who &apos;s orders ?
arthur &apos;s .
my wayward pupil has done something i did not foresee .
he &apos;s tethered me to excalibur .
arthur has ordered me
to re @-@ forge excalibur into a whole sword ,
which means i will need your dagger
and the promethean flame .
no .
then he will order me to kill your family ,
and emma , as much as i hate it , i will obey him .
arthur has my family ?
? yes .
because of me . i &apos;m sorry .
he wants to make a trade
in the heart of the caledonian forest in one hour ...
their lives for the dagger and the flame .
that &apos;s not enough time . this isn &apos;t even a flame yet .
i &apos;ve seen ? the strength in you , emma .
when you &apos;re ready to light the spark , it will burn .
and arthur will have what he wants .
the sword will be whole once again .
so , i &apos;m just supposed to give up without a fight ?
acceptance is a form of strength .
i know the darkness lives in you , emma ,
but i beg you , please .
do not seek vengeance .
do not make the same mistakes as nimue .
who is nimue ?
what the hell happened back in camelot ?
i wish i knew .
that blond demon took my memory ,
same as yours .
the why destroy merlin &apos;s message ?
what aren &apos;t you bloody telling us ? !
that &apos;s enough ! he doesn &apos;t know anything .
he &apos;s a king with no kingdom .
as much as he hates it ...
he &apos;s not important anymore .
feel any better ?
i &apos;ll feel better when i have some answers .
emma said this whole thing was about me .
are you really that naive ?
she &apos;s manipulating you .
that &apos;s what the dark one does .
no .
this was emma talking .
there may not be any emma .
not anymore .
she &apos;s right .
this dark one ,
she has excalibur ,
and she is going to destroy all light magic .
so , that &apos;s what you think it &apos;s about ?
a sword she hasn &apos;t actually used ?
well , obviously , ? she needs another ingredient
to cast the spell .
so , we figure out what that is
and stop her from getting it .
and we get our emma back .
you can all look at magic spells till you &apos;re blue in the face .
but something happened between me and her in camelot .
the only way to help emma
is to find out what the hell it was .
crocodile , we need to talk .
didn &apos;t you hear ?
i &apos;m not that man anymore .
belle , you can , uh ...
yeah . sorry , i thought you might be emma .
it &apos;s a good thing i &apos;m not .
a crossbow wouldn &apos;t do you much good .
well , best we could manage .
i did have some squid ink set aside for a rainy day ,
but , uh , unfortunately ...
... she found it .
dark ones are clever like that ,
clever enough ? to make everyone believe
that they &apos;ve really changed .
i need to know what &apos;s going on inside emma &apos;s head now .
she said she &apos;s doing all this because of me .
this isn &apos;t about what you did .
it &apos;s about what she did .
you &apos;re sure of that ?
i &apos;ve seen the look on her face .
one that i @-@ i know only too well ...
regret .
i became the dark one to save my son .
committed countless sins along the way ,
convinced myself i would atone for them all
once i &apos;d found him .
but things never work out the way you think they will .
if you want to find out what emma swan is after ,
find out what she &apos;s atoning for .
and how do i do that ?
i &apos;ve been looking all over for her .
she doesn &apos;t want to be found .
then you have to give her a reason to find you .
emma !
what happened between us ?
what the hell do you want from me ?
i wouldn &apos;t light that if i were you .
which as a matter of fact , i am .
if arthur uses that to forge excalibur ,
he will kill you ,
and that &apos;s bad news for those of us in your head .
i don &apos;t have a choice .
i need to ignite this spark to save my family .
i can &apos;t risk their lives .
what the hell &apos;s wrong with this ?
wrong with it ?
or wrong with you ?
merlin said you can only light that
when you &apos;re ready to let go of the darkness .
so , perhaps you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re wrong .
well , prove it then , dearie . light the flame .
go on , do it .
just ... just do it .
just ... just light it !
i &apos;m trying !
henry .
you weren &apos;t supposed to see that .
what were you trying to do ?
get this flame lit .
well , what do the voices say ?
that i can &apos;t do it
because i don &apos;t want to give up the darkness .
maybe you just need a little motivation .
here .
i &apos;ve got something to show you .
a little project hook and i were working on .
operation light swan .
he was looking for a house you &apos;d like
so when we get back home ...
he can ask me to move in .
he said that the house is a promise ,
kind of like a plan for the future .
you know what ?
that voice in my head was right .
i don &apos;t want to give up the darkness .
not yet .
what ?
i need to use it one last time .
i brought the dagger and the flame ,
but you don &apos;t get it until you free my family .
no .
you will hand it over now , or i unleash merlin .
emma , please .
i don &apos;t want to fight you .
no , but i do .
so , now that mommy &apos;s got her magic back ...
... tell us , dark one .
what are you gonna do ?
and then the witch opened the oven ,
stoked the flames , ready to put gretel inside .
felt that one .
you must like this book as much as your mom .
ok , steady on .
something &apos;s wrong .
something &apos;s wrong !
help ! i need help !
somebody help me !
let me out !
what &apos;s wrong ? what happened ?
a bit difficult to explain .
you better see for yourselves .
careful . it could be another one of her tricks .
well , don &apos;t just stare ! help me !
how ... how has this happened ?
you &apos;re only two months pregnant .
well , how do you think ?
dark magic .
who &apos;s dark magic ?
emma swan !
emma swan !
emma swan !
i guess we &apos;ll have to do this the hard way .
you were sure i &apos;d save you ?
well , i &apos;m either optimistic or desperate or both .
i need to know what happened between us in camelot .
just tell me .
it &apos;s not that easy .
it can be .
whatever you did ,
whatever you are trying to atone for ,
i already forgive you .
i don &apos;t need forgiveness .
then come clean .
i assure you , you &apos;ve done no worse than i.
i was a pirate for hundreds of years .
and you think it &apos;s the same ?
you see this ?
belonged to a man named barnaby .
called me &quot; one hand jones . &quot;
i killed him in front of his wife ,
took his ring .
this one ... edgar .
fine sailor .
i caught him drinking the captain &apos;s wine .
i drowned him .
every ring is a sad story .
what about this one ?
you have it . i thought i lost it in camelot .
you gave it to me to keep safe .
it &apos;s the saddest story of all .
belonged to a better man than i ...
my brother liam .
you can have it back now .
keep it .
you know , i used to wear these rings as trophies .
but all that changed when i met you .
what are they now ?
a reminder .
that all sins can be forgiven when someone loves you .
and i was absolutely wrong before .
i love you , emma swan ,
no matter what you &apos;ve done .
so , you really want to know the truth no matter how awful ?
i do .
then there &apos;s something i need to show you .
i &apos;ve already seen your home , swan .
why are we here ?
you promised me the truth , not a bloody tour .
the truth is tricky .
you have to look for it .
all right .
i &apos;ll play your game .
i guess being the dark one has its perks .
that is a stunning view of the sea .
there &apos;s no sight like a full moon on the waves .
back in camelot ,
you said the ocean calmed you .
i thought you might like to see it .
you picked yourself a fine home . i give you that .
i didn &apos;t pick it .
you did .
that &apos;s my handwriting .
you said this was our future together .
everything i &apos;ve done has been to keep that future alive .
well , then i guess this is the moment
that you tell me the truth .
almost there .
almost .
i can &apos;t tell you everything that happened between us
until it &apos;s all over .
why not ?
because if you knew what i was really after ,
you &apos;d do everything in your power to stop me .
what did you do ?
you have to stay calm and breathe .
shut up ! i was a fake midwife . i know the drill .
zelena , why would emma do this ?
i have no idea !
are you sure it was her ?
let &apos;s just say when the dark one offers you onion rings ...
... don &apos;t eat them !
someone scream for a doctor ?
there is an angry baby inside of me .
get it out !
you know , the last time i delivered a baby ,
you tried to steal it .
but why try to steal one
when making one is so much more fun , right ?
dr. whale .
we really need another doctor in this town .
and what &apos;s with the dye job ?
oh , so ... so emma changes her hair
and no one makes a fuss ,
but i get ridiculed ? yeah ?
come on . you know you like it .
oh , my god , stop talking !
didn &apos;t i kill you the last time i was here ?
no , you just threw me across the room .
i hope that doesn &apos;t happen again this time .
okay , all business today . got it .
uh , let &apos;s get those vitals going , get that baby out of you .
everybody get ready .
we have to protect that baby from emma .
she &apos;s here ?
she will be soon .
and we found that spell to destroy light magic
in merlin &apos;s spell book .
the only thing she needs other than excalibur is ...
cries of a newborn child .
well , she &apos;s not taking this baby .
not while i &apos;m still alive .
regina .
take this cuff off so i can defend myself and my child .
please .
you are far from trustworthy .
but worry not . i &apos;ll protect the baby .
what happens to you , well ...
just do something !
so , dark one , who should i execute first ?
your boyfriend or your father ?
you can have the flame .
zelena , make sure that &apos;s real .
now you want to give me my family ?
or keep fighting ?
merlin !
please , emma .
give him the flame .
this is a battle you cannot win .
i wish you could defeat me , emma .
but i &apos;ve played this game for too long .
merlin , kill her mother .
mary margaret !
it &apos;s no good . they &apos;re too strong .
keep trying .
merlin , you have to fight it .
i can &apos;t !
you are the greatest sorcerer that has ever lived .
if you cannot fight off the darkness ,
no one can .
i said kill her !
by the sword , i command you !
kill her !
i can &apos;t hold him off much longer .
you ... will ... kill her .
not today , mate .
i know someone else who needs that .
get us out of here .
i &apos;m okay .
thank you .
easy , swan .
you got tagged pretty good there .
so did you .
this thing ?
well , i &apos;ve had worse cuts
itching my nose with the wrong hand .
hold still .
thank you .
didn &apos;t even sting .
look at that .
there &apos;s a sword .
killian , we did it .
now all i have to do is light the spark
and then we can get the darkness out .
well , then let &apos;s do it and go home .
you punched him ? awesome .
gave him a left hook , if you know what i mean .
well , the woods are clear .
zelena and arthur must have retreated
somewhere far from here .
i &apos;m afraid merlin won &apos;t be much help .
resisting excalibur has taken its toll on him .
and emma ?
how &apos;s she doing with the spark ?
well , she said she needed some time alone .
she took it outside .
need a light ?
regina .
i thought you could use a friend .
he &apos;s playing with me .
he said i can &apos;t light it
because i &apos;m not ready to let go of the darkness .
are you ?
regina .
no one knows the lure of darkness better than i do .
you can lie to your parents , you can lie to yourself .
but you can &apos;t lie to me .
i don &apos;t know .
feels good , doesn &apos;t it ?
indulging every impulse ,
wielding great power ,
doing whatever you want .
yes .
yes , it does .
is that wrong ?
of course it is .
but it &apos;s also human .
look , i know you , emma .
it took a long time , but i really know you .
and you &apos;re not as weak as i once was ,
so if you &apos;re clinging to the darkness ,
you have good reason ,
and it &apos;s beyond temptation , so what is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s a difference between not knowing something
and not wanting to admit it .
those walls you put up , emma ,
it &apos;s time they come down .
what are you doing ?
helping you break the walls .
as your friend , i command you , dark one ,
tell me , why are you so afraid to give up the darkness ?
once i let it go , i won &apos;t be able to protect my family .
that &apos;s another wall , emma .
now ... the truth .
it is .
regina , please .
no , it &apos;s not .
you just have to be brave enough
to knock down all those walls you &apos;re hiding behind .
the dagger can make you look ,
but you ... you have to choose to see .
now come on , come on . emma , see .
tell me what you &apos;re really afraid of !
regina , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m getting answers .
by controlling her ? that &apos;s enough .
are you all right ?
you really think you &apos;re helping her by being cruel ?
i wasn &apos;t cruel .
i &apos;ve been cruel . and trust me , you &apos;d know it .
i was getting to the truth .
it &apos;s not my fault that it &apos;s painful .
push .
you &apos;re almost there .
you &apos;re doing great . one more push .
congratulations .
it &apos;s a baby girl .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s come to this .
am i really helping zelena ?
it &apos;s the right thing to do , regina .
so , are you ready to meet the newest member of your family ?
honestly ...
i don &apos;t know .
robin .
regina .
i have a daughter .
that &apos;s wonderful .
look who &apos;s green with envy now ?
look who &apos;s glowing . congrats .
i will not let you take this baby .
not without a fight .
that would be a problem if it was the baby i was after .
zelena .
why are you here ?
your insane girlfriend sped up my pregnancy ,
kidnapped me right after giving birth ,
and separated me from my little girl .
and they say i &apos;m wicked .
why would she do that ?
what does she need you for ?
from the looks of things ,
she &apos;s casting a spell to steal my magic .
why does she need more dark magic ?
i don &apos;t .
i &apos;m not taking zelena &apos;s magic .
i &apos;m giving her mine instead .
what ?
killian , you were right .
my plan is not to destroy light magic .
it &apos;s been to destroy dark magic ...
the dark magic that &apos;s inside of me .
if that were true ,
why keep it secret from me or the rest of your family ?
because i knew you would never let me do
what was necessary to get the job done .
and that &apos;s where i come in .
yes .
the darkness needs to be contained in a vessel ... you .
emma , what are you going to do ?
what needs to be done .
i &apos;m going to cut her down
with excalibur &apos;s enchanted blade ,
and the darkness will be vanquished forever .
that &apos;s why you needed my baby out .
i don &apos;t want anyone to get hurt who doesn &apos;t have to .
there are limits .
you call those limits , emma ?
you &apos;re still talking about cold @-@ blooded murder .
killian , she killed neal and marian .
given time , she will kill you , too .
after today , you can be certain .
this isn &apos;t about zelena , emma .
it &apos;s about you .
we went to camelot for merlin &apos;s help .
surely he has a solution to the darkness
that doesn &apos;t require this .
merlin can &apos;t help us anymore .
why not ?
what happened there ?
why are you really doing this ?
there you are .
been looking everywhere for you .
dagger &apos;s right here .
regina was going to use it on me .
why not you ?
what she did was wrong .
i &apos;m sorry it had to happen .
it &apos;s funny . i &apos;m not .
she was right .
i do know why i &apos;m scared to let go of the darkness .
because of her , i finally admitted it to myself .
what are you so afraid of , love ?
this . our future .
i see you talked to henry .
sometimes i forget that boys can &apos;t keep secrets .
don &apos;t blame him .
he just thought it would help if i
knew what i had to look forward to when we got home .
what are you trying to tell me ?
that you can &apos;t ignite the promethean flame
because you &apos;re afraid to take the plunge and move in with me ?
it &apos;s not about moving in . it &apos;s ...
... everything .
when i told you i loved you back in storybrooke ,
it was because i thought i was never going to see you again .
it was the same way with neal .
i could only admit my true feelings
when i thought i was losing him ... and you .
well , i guess it &apos;s even worse than i thought .
you can &apos;t even see any future at all with me .
that &apos;s not it . don &apos;t you get it ?
i &apos;m afraid because i do want a future with you .
you do ?
yes .
and the minute you take away the darkness ,
that future begins .
i know it sounds crazy .
doesn &apos;t sound crazy at all , emma .
that sounds like music to this pirate &apos;s ears .
you just have to trust me .
the future &apos;s nothing to be afraid of .
see ?
i don &apos;t understand .
how can emma destroy light magic using zelena ?
she can &apos;t .
what is she planning ?
your guess is as good as mine .
all i know is no one hurts my sister but me .
what are you planning to do once you find emma ?
oh , it &apos;s simple .
i &apos;m going to show the dark swan
what dark magic really looks like .
do you hear emma pacing around up there ?
you &apos;re her boy toy . what do you think she &apos;s up to ?
i &apos;m no one &apos;s toy .
we need to find a way to get rid of these iron shackles
before emma gets back .
those shackles aren &apos;t the problem .
this one is .
when regina put it back on , she enchanted my wrist ,
and i can &apos;t cut it off .
without magic ,
we &apos;re never gonna get out of here alive .
it &apos;s a good thing i happen to have some then .
what ? you &apos;ve got magic ?
no . my hook does .
as you recall ,
i imbued it with magic to rip your heart out .
well , go on , then . what are you waiting for ?
the last time i tried helping you ,
you betrayed me .
how do i know i can trust you now ?
you don &apos;t .
but you also don &apos;t have a choice .
fair point .
well , then , here &apos;s to trust .
feels so good to be back .
now , about that deal we made .
shall we get out of here ?
regina , she &apos;s still our daughter .
we can &apos;t go to war with her .
if you don &apos;t have the stomach for this ...
i &apos;m not going to hurt her .
this is exactly why she gave me the dagger .
she knew i &apos;m the only one
who could do what has to be done .
now , stand back ,
or i &apos;ll make you stand back .
no , we are coming with you .
and not only will we stop her ,
we will save her .
i don &apos;t need saving .
you &apos;re gonna have to trust me .
by the time i &apos;m done with zelena ,
you &apos;ll all be thanking me , especially you , regina .
and why would i thank you ?
you don &apos;t remember this , but back in camelot ,
you helped me admit some things about myself .
and now i &apos;m ready to repay the favor .
because deep down ,
we both know you &apos;ll be happier when zelena is gone .
gone ?
this is not the way , miss swan ,
and you know it .
we &apos;re back to miss swan ?
well , start acting like emma again and we &apos;ll talk .
i am emma .
good , she &apos;s busy .
we &apos;ll have to sneak out the back .
i &apos;m not coming with you .
are you joking ?
i actually keep my word ,
and you decide to go down with the ship .
if i don &apos;t stop emma ,
she &apos;ll just find somebody else to put her darkness into ,
and if i leave now , i may never get the answers i need .
and how are you going to get them ?
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s in a sharing mood .
emma stole squid ink from gold &apos;s shop .
if i can find it ,
then i can get her to tell me what i want .
well then , you better hope she doesn &apos;t find you first .
ta @-@ ta .
really ?
i was trying to help you .
swan .
i &apos;m sorry , love .
you &apos;ve left me no choice .
regina was right .
you are a villain now ,
and now you &apos;re gonna tell me
exactly what happened in camelot to make you that way .
how are you going to make me do that ?
i &apos;ve got some ideas .
i see you found the squid ink , captain .
zelena , why the hell did you come back ?
i thought about how you said you couldn &apos;t run
untill you got some answers .
and i realize i couldn &apos;t run either ...
not without making the dark one pay .
whatever you think you &apos;re doing ...
no !
no !
i bet you didn &apos;t see that coming , did you ?
of course that &apos;s nothing compared to the surprise
that you &apos;re feeling right now .
you &apos;re saying to yourself ,
&quot; i just got stabbed in the chest .
why shouldn &apos;t it hurt more ?
why am i not dead ? &quot;
what the hell is happening ?
answer me , witch !
well , you could take my word ,
or you could return the memories
that the dark one stole .
see for yourself .
i found this outside .
don &apos;t trust her .
i can explain everything , killian .
do it .
are you ready ?
yes .
then it &apos;s time
to destroy the darkness once and for all .
bloody hell .
hook , what &apos;s wrong ?
he &apos;s bleeding !
killian .
no .
when did that happen ?
it was excalibur .
but it was just a small cut . i healed it .
i &apos;m afraid it only seemed that way .
excalibur was forged to cut immortal ties .
a wound from it cannot be healed .
what ? there has to be something we can do , that she can do .
even emma &apos;s power isn &apos;t strong enough ,
nor is my own .
killian , you have to hold on . i can &apos;t lose you .
it &apos;s all right .
emma , it &apos;s all right .
no . please , no .
don &apos;t leave me . you have to stay .
you have to stay . come on , killian .
what about our future together ?
our future is now .
reunite the blades
so i can see them before i go .
no !
no ?
i &apos;m not gonna let him die when i know there &apos;s a way to save him .
emma ...
merlin said it . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
that &apos;s what he said , but it &apos;s not true , is it ?
you told me how powerful i am . let &apos;s use that power .
i @-@ i can use the promethean flame
to release you from excalibur , and then i can use it
to tether hook &apos;s life to it instead .
it could save him .
emma , you know what that could do .
create another dark one .
it will multiply the darkness
so that it cannot be destroyed .
not without paying the steepest of prices .
it will be your final step into the dark .
i don &apos;t care what happens to me .
emma , wait .
please . listen , you can &apos;t .
emma , your parents are right .
if you could &apos;ve saved daniel or robin ...
look how far you were willing to go ,
how far you pushed me to save him !
i &apos;m not gonna lose killian .
i won &apos;t let anyone stop me .
emma .
killian .
you &apos;re going to be okay .
no , please .
you have to let me go .
i don &apos;t want to pay this price .
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t want to become that .
you won &apos;t .
you can fight the darkness . i can help you .
we can do it together .
i &apos;m not as strong as you are ... or merlin .
i &apos;m weak .
the things i &apos;ve done ... i &apos;ve done .
i &apos;ve succumbed to darkness before in my life .
and it took centuries to push it away .
i don &apos;t know if i can do it again .
but our future ...
i &apos;ll just be happy knowing that ...
that you have one .
that &apos;s not enough for me !
what &apos;s happening ?
it &apos;s too late .
i &apos;m so sorry , killian .
but i did not have a choice .
no , no , no .
no , there has to be some other explanation .
are you finding the truth hard to swallow ?
here .
have a look at the sword .
a glamour spell .
it was there the whole time right under your nose ,
and you didn &apos;t even see it .
i suppose it &apos;s not the dark one anymore , is it ?
more like the dark ones .
so , that &apos;s why you saved my life twice tonight .
i was never in any danger .
you just wanted to keep me from the truth .
i wanted to fix it first to make up for what i had done .
by killing me ?
how sweet .
it was the only way
to destroy the darkness in both of us .
everything i &apos;ve done since we got back to storybrooke
was to try to save you , killian .
this is saving ?
how could you do this to me ?
i &apos;m sorry .
so much for our future , swan .
now , tell me .
are you ready to learn what else happened in camelot ?
aye .
but first we have to take care of her .
