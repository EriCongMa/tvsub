hi , i &apos;m gonna be your waitress ,
&apos;cause my mother drank .
we need a sec .
feeling &apos; kinda generous , take two .
then he said to me , &quot; dude , your vagina is weird . &quot;
dude , that &apos;s insane .
it is so not weird .
your vagina &apos;s awesome .
okay , i &apos;m ready .
now i need a sec .
well , it &apos;s over .
i can &apos;t say it anymore .
the vagina &apos;s gone mainstream .
what &apos;s next ? a clothing line at target ?
aw , max , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s your favorite word .
and my favorite body part .
but now everyone &apos;s saying it .
well , we can pick another word for it .
something cute , like cookie .
yeah , it sounds like a good idea
until you walk past a bunch of girl scouts
selling their cookies on the street .
well , we &apos;ve gotta pick something ,
&apos;cause vagina &apos;s everywhere .
where ?
this is invitation to metropolitan museum annual gala .
we have the invitation . she &apos;ll be there .
you are talking about us stalking martha stewart .
so you want me to taste your cupcake in the ladies &apos; room ?
what &apos;s inappropriate about that ?
that is our beer batter
maple bacon spring break cupcake .
quite tasty .
do you girls have a card ?
martha stewart likes our cupcakes !
max , have you seen my phone ?
i wanna take a picture of this bad tip
and put it on instagram .
getting loose change used to be so depressing ,
but now i can share it with strangers .
let me sum it up .
twitter is stupid .
and instagram is twitter for people who can &apos;t read .
where is my phone ?
i could &apos;ve sworn i left it right here , next to yours .
oh , i &apos;ll just call it .
oh , that &apos;s not necessary .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll turn up ...
* my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard *
* and there like it &apos;s better than yours *
in my pocket .
max , why are you hiding my phone in your apron ?
is that the big question , really ?
&apos;cause i think the bigger question is ,
why is your ringtone
&quot; my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard &quot; ?
if you have to ask that ,
you clearly have not seen my milkshake .
okay , here . i &apos;m busted .
i was checking to see if martha stewart called us yet .
you checked it again ?
you check it , like , every 15 minutes .
i know ! i am acting like a little bitch .
max , martha stewart has our business card .
she liked our cupcakes . she &apos;ll call .
look , in my defense , she asked for our card .
she got us all hot and bothered . and then what ?
nothing .
martha stewart is a cake tease .
how dare you !
martha stewart is not a cake tease .
nothing worse than a cake tease .
ask any man .
yeah , you shower , you powder your sack .
for what ?
look , max , relax . she &apos;ll call .
everything &apos;s gonna work out .
i mean , a year ago ,
we didn &apos;t even have a cupcake business .
look how far we &apos;ve come .
i haven &apos;t come at all ,
thanks to the cake tease .
oh , your cupcake is quite tasty .
do you have a card ?
max , that &apos;s a good martha stewart .
i know , &apos; cause i can &apos;t get her siren voice out of my head .
wow , han .
you look you were hit by a mardi gras
and a gay pride float .
i have just returned from the exciting
manhattan restaurant trade show .
look at all this free swag .
and i &apos;ve got stress balls .
well , just go in the back and take care of yourself .
listen up , everybody .
i have a big announcement .
well , more like a 5 &apos; 1 annoucement .
i am changing the diner to state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art
computer &quot; power touch &quot; ordering system for food and checks .
i am not learning anything new .
i work here because i have no skills .
you don &apos;t have to learn it , max .
it &apos;s very smart machine .
it will help you .
that &apos;s how it started with machines in the matrix .
next thing you know , the human race was enslaved .
been there , done that .
i &apos;m with max .
we are doing it .
it &apos;s important to move the business into the future .
so get with it , you luddites .
反对机械代替人力的人们
girls , we got big trouble .
if he starts using a new system ,
i won &apos;t be to use my old system ,
where i skim somethig of the top .
earl , skimming ?
i &apos;m kind of shocked .
i don &apos;t do it for me .
you know how once a month you girls
have a really good night in tips ?
you are welcome .
i have been lying awake at night trying to figure out
how we made that 200 bucks with her skills .
hey , girls .
hey , sophie .
you know , every time i come here ,
i &apos;m surprised you &apos;re still open .
here you go , sophie .
where &apos;s the little asian woman
that always hands me my menu ?
asian woman ?
you mean han ?
sophie , han &apos;s a man .
if you say so .
is there anything special tonight ?
yes .
here i am ...
with treats for my sweet .
day @-@ glo zebra ?
that &apos;s my favorite animal .
oh , and edible underwear !
that &apos;s my favorite snack .
yeah , and they &apos;re crotchless , so less carbs .
oh , and my favorite microwavable lube .
and what &apos;s this ?
toothbrushes ?
oh , that &apos;s going to hurt you , but okay .
no , i want to leave them at your house ,
now that you and i are exclusive .
exclusive ?
wait , hold phone .
are you telling me that you and i
are not exclusive ?
exclusive ?
oh , come on .
stop it now . go on jay leno .
caroline , did you think sophie and i were exclusive ?
well , you have stopped showing us your penis .
exactly !
if that &apos;s not exclusive , i don &apos;t know what is .
exclusive !
oh , my god .
oh , come on , stop it , before i--
it happened .
i split my spanx .
martha stewart , please .
it &apos;s michelle obama .
what &apos;s this about ?
my sheets shrunk and i am pissed .
hello ?
max , it didn &apos;t work when you were mick jagger
with a busted muffin tin ,
or alicia keys with a wonky shower curtain .
and it really didn &apos;t work when you were steve jobs
back from the dead with thoughts on her panini press .
stop sober dialing martha stewart !
who says i &apos;m sober ?
max , give me your phone .
* my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard . *
now give me my phone .
okay , take it , done .
i &apos;m over her .
when is she gonna call me ?
my milkshake would totally bring her to the yard .
max , this isn &apos;t you .
i mean , you &apos;re strong .
you &apos;re a badass .
you beat h.p.v. with tylenol .
某些种类可随性行为入侵人体后引起疣或癌症
and it wasn &apos;t even the name brand .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i was a virgin before martha , okay ?
no one ever told me i was good at anything before her .
and you never forget your first rich white woman .
with or without martha stewart ,
we &apos;re gonna build our cupcake business
and be a success , i just know it .
how ? how do you know that ?
i know because you have the talent ,
i have the vision , and because i feel it .
i feel it here .
oh , blegh ! your heart ?
no . my pearls- my lucky pearls .
by lucky , do you mean ugly ?
i &apos;ve worn these every day
since i was evicted from my townhouse .
this pearl necklace brings me luck .
you--
you think your life is lucky ?
this morning you used toilet paper as a coffee filter ...
and then used it as toilet paper .
i know this sounds silly to you ,
but there is something about
putting on these pearls every day
that makes me feel strong , confident ,
and like anything is possible .
and as long as i have these lucky--
oh , no . oh , no !
no , no , no , don &apos;t freak out .
don &apos;t freak out . we &apos;ll get em .
my pearls !
my lucky pearls !
yes , yes , we have identified the problem .
just pick them up .
looks like somebody found breakfast .
no , chestnut !
i &apos;m still using that .
well , nothing &apos;s gonna work out now .
here comes the bad luck .
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
your luck couldn &apos;t get any worse .
or could it ?
okay , earl .
this is the l @-@ 520 order system touch pad .
look how simple . see ?
i &apos;m telling you ,
i can &apos;t figure this tricky little thing out .
earl , it &apos;s an on / off button .
oh , slow down .
it does both ?
let me just charge this up for you right here .
this thing has been plugged
more than the kardashian sisters .
i better check the old wiring in diner first .
max , now i feel like everyone &apos;s staring
at my chest area .
well , welcome to my life ,
every day since i was nine .
that necklace meant something special to me .
didn &apos;t you ever lose anything sentimental
you had for a long time ?
my mother , but then she found her way back .
look , i am done waiting for martha to call .
i say we go down there with some cupcakes ,
remind her how much she liked them ,
and suggest she puts us on her show .
no , i mean , i can &apos;t go without my pearls .
and it &apos;s more than just the luck .
it &apos;s who i was before i lost everything .
you know how i always say ,
&quot; hi , i &apos;m caroline channing , &quot;
and then touch my pearls ?
i &apos;m not just introducing myself .
i &apos;m reminding myself .
well , let me remind you of something else .
yesterday you told me
we were going to rule the world with cupcakes .
yeah , that was the pearls talking .
okay , well , now i &apos;m talking .
there is no luck .
there is only work .
and right now , you &apos;re working my last nerve .
so i am going down there myself .
and if martha won &apos;t help me ,
i &apos;ma bust her kneecaps with a rolling pin
and then say , &quot; now that &apos;s a good thing . &quot;
okay , what if we just send martha an e @-@ mail ,
so we &apos;re not just standing in her office ,
begging some receptionist ?
that won &apos;t do anything .
yes , it will .
i craft amazing business e @-@ mails .
i went to wharton .
please don &apos;t , max . that &apos;s all i have left .
max , caroline , i found something
at the restaurant trade show
you might be interested in .
the only restaurant trade i &apos;m interested in
is if we can exchange you for anybody else .
you won &apos;t be laughing in a minute .
look , it &apos;s a cupcake from the new
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art cupcake atm machine .
sprinkles cupcakes plans to be put them everywhere .
soon , everyone will be able to just push a button ,
day or night , and get the cupcake .
so , i guess what i &apos;m saying is ,
you might be screwed .
delicious ...
and no attitude .
well , more bad luck .
i thought you were kidding ,
but the machines are taking over .
we can &apos;t compete with that .
the business is done . game over .
man , you are never gonna make it in the future .
this is where the humans fight .
this is where we march down to martha stewart
and demand a damn blurb ,
so we can compete with the machines ...
just like in &quot; terminator 2 : rise of the desserts . &quot;
fine . let &apos;s go see martha .
she &apos;s our only hope .
my lucky necklace is gone .
we can no longer just wait for magic to happen .
uh , thank you , by the way ,
for never telling me that our former plan was magic .
we &apos;ll just reintroduce ourselves and our cupcakes to martha
and impress her all over again ,
even though i &apos;m wearing a necklace that i hate .
it &apos;s limp , anemic , and lackluster .
i have an olsen twin around my neck .
特点是衣着随意 脸色苍白
here .
what are you doing ?
so martha will recognize me .
hi , excuse me . two questions .
which floor is martha stewart on ?
and should i lose this necklace ?
well , your silence speaks volumes .
hi , i &apos;m not crazy ,
so you can just tell me the floor number .
elevator right over there , 15th floor ,
martha stewart living omnimedia .
just got a little damp .
thanks for your help . feels better .
smart , getting necklace advice
from a guy with no neck .
wait . is that--
that &apos;s the cupcake machine that han was talking about .
全美目前唯一的一台 位于加州比佛利山庄
ugh , no !
i was hoping it &apos;d be ugly ,
but it &apos;s pink and really cute .
it &apos;s like a gay r2 @-@ d2 .
well , a gayer r2 @-@ d2 .
who wouldn &apos;t want a cupcake from this ?
no one .
we have to mess her up .
what ?
why are you carrying spray @-@ paint in your purse ?
for the same reason i carry a tampon .
&apos;cause you never know .
we are not gonna destroy someone else &apos;s property .
well , we have to do something ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s that machine or us .
oh , i know .
we can open the little door and put a poop in it .
not one of mine . jeez !
what am i , a pig ?
well , i &apos;m not doing it .
no , we just get some puppy poop from the street .
no !
we are not that desperate .
and i &apos;m out of wetnaps .
no , see , we already met martha .
we &apos;re just stopping by to say hi .
you &apos;ve already met martha .
you &apos;re just stopping by to say hi .
yes .
martha stewart asked us for our card .
martha stewart asked you for your card .
and where should i tell martha she asked for your card ?
in the ladies &apos; room .
martha stewart asked you for your card in the ladies &apos; room .
okay .
don &apos;t make it sound like that . it happened .
we cornered her in the ladies &apos; room and--
okay , don &apos;t make it sound like that either .
we went to a gala on the off chance
that she would be gracious enough
to try one of our cupcakes and she did .
she was very gracious .
yeah , maybe cornered was the wrong word .
it &apos;s not like we went there to hunt her down .
it &apos;s not like you went there to hunt her down .
it &apos;s not .
okay , i hear your tone .
i see what &apos;s going down here .
you think i &apos;m some kind of a problem .
well , for the record , martha came on to me .
all right . okay .
this is not going as well as we had hoped .
don &apos;t know how it could without my magic pearls .
okay , look .
i get that you &apos;re not gonna let us up there .
and i don &apos;t blame you ,
what , with this one talking about magic .
but just so you know , we are not lying .
it happened .
and after we hunted her down--
because , yeah , you got us on that , we did--
martha told us
she liked our entrepreneurial drive .
well , that does sound like martha .
okay , i &apos;ll send these up . have a seat .
ahh , thank you so much .
and here , uh , please take one ,
just so you can see for yourself
why martha asked for our card .
well , i was gonna get a cupcake
from that cute machine downstairs later .
oh , don &apos;t .
i heard someone found something nasty in that ...
in about an hour .
max .
and this is our beer batter
maple bacon spring break cupcake .
i can see why martha @-@ ow !
what the--
i cracked my tooth !
what ? oh !
what is that ? is it--
is that glass ?
no , it &apos;s a pearl .
i &apos;m so sorry .
sorry ? you &apos;re sorry ?
i &apos;ve been wearing invisaligns for 11 months !
well , there goes our big break .
never would &apos;ve happened if i had had my necklace .
the one with the lucky pearls
that broke into the batter and that woman
just spit into her hand mixed with saliva and blood ?
that lucky necklace ?
yes .
might as well face it .
you and i are on our own .
and not just because of martha either .
because there is no such thing as good luck .
never seen it .
and all lucky charms are stupid ,
except for the lucky charms ,
which are magically delicious .
look at it over there .
gay r2 @-@ d2 just laughing at us .
you were right , max .
you and i are on our own .
we &apos;re just a little start @-@ up cupcake company
in a hard , hard world .
and we gotta take matters into our own hands .
cover me .
wait , wait , no .
no , don &apos;t do it now .
the guard is right there .
hey , you !
stop that !
what kind of freaks deface a cupcake machine ?
run run run .
okay , stop , stop , stop . we lost him .
you know you only tagged the wall , right ?
yes , i have no luck .
no one has any luck ...
with the possible exception of lindsay lohan &apos;s lawyer .
曾多次犯事而反复出入监狱
look , it &apos;s martha !
she &apos;s getting in that car . give me the cupcakes .
i &apos;m going after her before she talks
to that lady whose mouth we broke .
max , don &apos;t jiggle the cupcakes !
don &apos;t worry .
oh , my god . oh , my god . oh , my god .
max , are you all right ?
are you all right ?
i &apos;m fine .
no broken bones ,
which is surprising , because when i was kid ,
we couldn &apos;t afford milk .
actually the only time my mother bought milk
was when my face was on the side of the carton .
are you sure you &apos;re all right ?
yeah .
i guess there is such a thing as luck .
and tomorrow night
when you come in for takeout , sophie ,
all max has to do is hit this little thing .
well , if i &apos;m allowed to hit little things ,
you &apos;re next .
change makes everyone so tense .
kitchen is now closed .
i have plans .
big plans .
sophie , i understand
your relationship with oleg is complicated ,
so let &apos;s simplify it .
are you having sex in our building tonight ,
and do i have to wear earplugs ?
i will be alone ...
but wear them anyway .
hi , um , sorry , we &apos;re closed .
i do not wish to eat .
i just got collect call from oleg .
she said we are closed .
oh ? and who are you ?
i &apos;m the last person you will see
before you learn how to walk again .
stay away from oleg ,
or i &apos;ll pull your intestines out through your nose
and give them to her to wear as new necklace .
fine .
i will leave .
but only because you have eyes of a python ,
and i have possible u.t.i.
sophie ...
why don &apos;t you just admit it , you and oleg ?
what ?
it &apos;s not like i want him .
it &apos;s just that where i come from ,
you never throw anything away .
here you go , ladies .
enjoy the extra tips from your credit cards ,
because when han flips that switch ,
the only tip i can give you is ,
don &apos;t wash your hair every day .
it dries it out .
okay . here comes the future .
one , two--
this old building sucks me so hard .
congratulations , ladies .
this is your lucky night .
speaking of luck ,
here are your pearls .
i found most of them , but i think
chestnut ate a few .
you can dig for those later yourself .
max .
and it won &apos;t look the same ,
because you have to string them on this cheap @-@ ass wire
i got at the hipster bead store ...
beading off .
we can add this earl bonus money
to our cupcake business total .
yeah , that 150 will really put a dent
in the 250,000 we need .
we &apos;ll get there , max .
because you and i have something martha stewart and machines don &apos;t .
unpaid bills ?
mushrooms growing on our bathroom rug ?
no , each other .
aww , a year later you &apos;re still
trying to get me to feel things .
do you wanna know the real reason
i thought this necklace was so lucky ?
i was wearing it the day i met you .
so , i &apos;m gonna have some extras .
do you wanna make one for yourself ?
nah , i &apos;ve had plenty of pearl necklaces ,
也有性爱完 男人射精在女性脖子周围的意思
and i find them more sticky than lucky .
max , ms @ marthastewartinc.com
&quot; haven &apos;t forgotten about you , girls .
martha stewart . &quot;
just when i thought i was out ,
