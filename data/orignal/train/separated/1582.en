I can't!
What's wrong?
We tried to have sex,
I freaked out, like a panic attack.
I was raped. Yeah.
That guy who...?
I thought I put it behind me but I still have some stuff
I have to work through.
Take as long as you need.
Lena gonna be OK?
Yeah, now, but she lost the baby.
You're just so good,
you make the rest of us look bad.
Well, there's nothing I can do about that.
Well, I mean, you could try to blend in.
This is a dance team.
What? Should I dye my hair?
We got a letter from Ana.
She wants to see the twins to make amends.
Oh, wow. What did you do?
I called Mike and I told him
that she's never coming anywhere
near our kids ever again.
Good.
Girls! Everyone out! Out of the house!
Where's Becca? Becca?!
Got her. Clear away!
She is gonna be OK.
I seriously have like nothing to wear.
And Mat won't tell me where we're going
so I don't know what to wear!
Too Big Bird?
I don't think you're not big anything.
More Tweety Bird.
Ha-ha. Seriously.
I need something like, sexy but not too sexy,
soft but not easy,
that says I'm a girl,
but don't treat me like one.
Right, so you're looking for really pretty armor?
No. I just...
Mat can be a little confrontational.
OK, a lot confrontational.
I mean, the boy feels the need to say everything he thinks.
So I wanna be pretty but protected.
Attractive, just not vulnerable.
Yeah. Like you.
You want some syrup for that, bud?
Since when do you work Sundays?
I'm escorting a funeral.
Since Mama and Jude aren't gonna be back until tomorrow,
I thought I'd pick up a little off-duty security work.
Unless you don't want me to go.
That fire was pretty intense. I can cancel, you know.
No, no. I have therapy anyway. I'm fine.
OK. You sure?
Yeah, I'm just happy everyone got out safe.
Yeah.
Where's everybody now? All the girls, I mean?
They went back to juvie,
until they can find a new place, if they can find place.
What does that mean?
Well, I guess there aren't many landlords
who wanna rent to a group home, so...
Well, I'm sure they'll find something.
Rita doesn't strike me
as the type of person who'd gives up easily.
So what time is the funeral gonna be over?
As long as it takes to get the guy in the ground,
I guess, Why? Planning another party?
What do you mean?
I was just asking. I have a big paper I'm writing.
It'd be easier to have no one here to distract me.
Well I have a music thing with Lou downtown,
so I won't be here.
Oh yeah? Why don't you...
Maybe you could take Callie with you.
Oh no, I don't wanna crash your thing.
It's not a thing. We're just hanging. You should come.
Really?
Yeah. I could pick you up after therapy.
Um, OK, well I'll think about it.
I'll call you after I'm done.
Ok.
Hey Miss Thing. Nice jacket.
Cute, right? Thank you.
Like I had a choice.
When are Mama and Jude coming home?
At least they're nice to me.
Oh, poor baby.
They'll be back tomorrow.
How's she doing?
Uh, she's doing... She's doing all right, I think.
Yeah, it's been good for her being out in nature,
you know, getting a little time off, a little time away.
We all have to be extra sweet to her when she gets back.
Losing a baby, is...
...it's one of the hardest things you can possibly go through.
All right, I gotta go.
Oh, hey, B, will you drop this off at your dad's on your way out?
Um... can't you?
Yes I can but I asked you to.
Thank you.
All right, my babies, I'll see you later.
All right.
How's your dad doing, after the breakup?
It's so weird. Didn't Dani just move in? What happened?
Um, I don't know. He's fine.
It's none of our business.
Sorry I should called. Mom asked me to...
Oh, thanks.
No problem.
I'd make you come in and have breakfast,
but I'm heading out in a minute.
It's cool. I have stuff to do anyway.
OK. I'll see you soon?
Yeah, sure.
I'm sorry about that.
I just... I'm not ready to get into this, with him.
No, don't worry about it.
I wasn't really ready to face him either.
Guess I can add him to my amends list.
He's already at the top of mine.
You... wanna read the next part?
Sure.
"We have a list of all persons we have harmed
and to whom we are willing to make amends.
We made it when we took inventory.
We subjected ourselves to a drastic self-appraisal.
Now we go out to our fellows and repair the damage
done in the past."
So why all the secrecy?
What kind of music festival is this?
Is it like a rave?
An underground warehouse death-metal battle of the bands?
Yup. I'm totally bringing you to 'The Seven Levels of Hell,
a Sound Experience That Will Explode Your Eardrums!'
I'm kidding.
Look.
Nice.
So when did these panic attacks start?
Well, I've been seeing Wyatt for a while now.
And we decided we wanted to have sex.
OK. Is that something you feel like you're ready for?
With Wyatt, I mean?
I do. I did, anyway.
But when we tried, I freaked out.
I couldn't breathe and I pushed him off of me.
It's been happening a few times a week since.
I even thought I saw Liam the other day, at work.
I think...
Do you think it's him, Liam?
You mean, do I think the rape is the cause of the panic attacks?
Maybe.
But things like that
generally start closer to the time of the event.
Do you trust Wyatt?
Yeah, completely.
But you also thought you could trust Liam, right?
And you were wrong.
So how can you trust your own judgment?
You think I can't trust my judgment?
No. I think you think you can't.
Especially when it comes to
making yourself so vulnerable to another person.
I think if you trusted yourself.
I wouldn't have panicked with Wyatt.
I think it's a possibility.
So, what am I supposed to do?
Did you see any signs
that Liam wasn't who he pretended to be?
Um, I guess, yeah.
People show us who they are, what they're capable of,
if we're paying attention, listening to our gut,
that's how we learn to trust ourselves,
by trusting we will act on our instincts
to keep ourselves safe.
You say you trust Wyatt completely
so trust your instincts.
Until he gives you a reason not to.
Sorry, we almost there.
Where are you taking me?
I'm not telling you.
That's kinda the point of the blindfold.
Fine.
What is this?
This is where we, you know, the first time.
It'll be like our first date all over again.
You mean our first hookup?
By the way, we haven't even had a real first date.
Is this all you think I am?
Some girl to get naked with in your garage?
No! No. This is romantic. Look flower petals.
I... picked these myself.
So this is it, huh?
Your plan for our big "Special date?"
Sex on a nasty old couch?
No! No, this is, um, this is just part one.
I just wanted to spend some time alone together
'cause no one's home.
Then I was gonna take you out.
Where?
Hello?
Oh, God. Just wait.
Hello?
Hi, Hayley. How are ya?
Mom, I thought you were supposed to be working that funeral?
I can see that that's what you thought.
But, well, they had to cancel.
Someone forgot to dig the grave.
So... what's up?
Just hanging out.
Uh-huh, well, you know the rules:
no hanging out with girls behind closed doors.
That's not fair. What if I was gay?
Are you? Gay?
No, but...
Point taken.
Then I guess there's no hanging out with anyone behind closed doors,
that includes garage doors too.
All right, we were on our way out, anyway.
I see. And what about that big paper that you had to work on?
I'll finish it tonight. You ready?
I'll just finish blowing out these candles for you,
bit of a fire hazard there, Jesus.
Hey.
Sorry to crash.
No worries. The more, the merrier.
Well, thank you. Um, I'm glad you say that, actually.
Hey. Good to see ya.
You know Lou, right?
Yeah we met at your party.
So what is this?
Some kinda Mexican street festival?
Seems cool.
Yeah, there's a main stage over there
and they usually play some pretty great music.
Nice.
Cool. Well, um, why don't we meet up with you there later?
Wyatt and I are gonna have a chow-down.
We are?
Mm-hmm, yeah, we're both gonna eat one item from every food stall,
and the first person to say "uncle," has to pay for it all.
Wait, so you think you're gonna out eat me?
No, I know I'm gonna out-eat you.
OK, it's on, girl.
How about we start with a little spicy corn,
Ok.
to line the stomach?
Yeah, how about it? Let's do it.
We're not doing that, right?
No.
OK, all right, cool. Let's go this way.
All right.
My grandfather used to bring me here every year.
He's a musician. He loves Latin music.
You like her?
Who?
Frida Kahlo.
I dunno. I mean, she could stand to tweeze a little.
Wait, you've never heard of Frida Kahlo?
No. Why? Because I'm a Mexican?
No because she's like a cultural icon.
Yeah, a Mexican cultural icon.
Yeah, but no, she's kind of international?
Well I didn't really grow up in a Latino home, so...
No, that's not what I meant.
Is something wrong?
No.
Wyatt?
Wyatt?
You OK?
Yeah.
Not exactly, no.
OK, well, why not?
Um, I've been having these panic attacks,
ever since we tried to...
Really?
It's not your fault at all.
Um... I'm just trying to...
I'm supposed to practice trusting myself.
I know that sounds dumb but it's actually harder than you think.
Anyway, I didn't really wanna come here today
'cause the crowds and everything.
But I know that one of the things I can trust is you, so...
I'm right here.
I was just getting these.
For you, my lady.
Nerd.
Unless you're full?
I mean, we can stop, anytime you want.
All you've gotta do is say the word.
No, No, I'm starving.
You're starving, huh?
Mm-hm.
You'll definitely enjoy this meatball then.
Yeah, cheers. Mm-hm.
Cheers.
Mmmm. Delicious.
Right?
Tamale? Unless you've had enough.
Baby, we are just getting started.
I'm really glad you called.
Me, too.
Hey, Liam. I'm hungry, man. Let's go.
I'm so glad you're getting the day off, you deserve it.
It'll be good for you, a little quiet time to yourself.
Not really sure what I'm gonna do with myself.
You don't have to do anything. Why not just... be?
I'm serious.
That's what's been so great about this trip.
All this time out in the woods has really let me connect,
you know, with... this.
OK, Earth Mother. I got it.
We're both grieving, honey.
Yeah. I know. I'm OK.
OK. Maybe you could,
I dunno, meditate or something?
I mean it.
I know you do. That's what scares me.
I will try it, sweetheart. Thank you. I love you.
I love you, too.
水管漏水怎么修
Oh my god, this is so cool.
How did you know about this?
I told you, I wanted to do something that's really special,
so I did a bunch of research on all the cool events
that were happening this weekend.
I'm sorry I doubted you. I'm very impressed.
And hungry.
Yeah? Let's go get you a taco.
You know what? I read the best tacos are actually over here.
Wow you did do your research.
Thank you.
You like this?
Hear that rhythm line? It's so intricate.
What's that?
It's a Guitarro. Yeah.
A Guitarro.
It's like a bass. But so much more.
It's totally the backbone of the band.
What?
Nothing. I just didn't realize
you were into all these different kinds of music.
You're full of surprises.
There's more where that came from.
And of course Jesus and sweet Mariana.
"Taking money from her to buy drugs
was probably the worst thing I ever did."
I mean, how am I supposed to make amends to those two?
What'd your sponsor say? "Staying sober's a good start."
I get it. I feel the same way about Brandon.
Yeah, you didn't abandon your son.
No. Not literally.
But I did it in all kinds of other ways.
I mean, the relationship with Dani...
I shoulda never started that so soon after I got sober.
I had Brandon living here with me.
I shoulda made him a priority, instead of...
And it goes all the way back.
After the divorce, I shoulda fought for custody.
Or at least partial custody.
But the truth is, I didn't think I could handle it.
And it's a lot harder to drink
all the time with a little kid running around.
I managed. With two of 'em.
To drink, use coke, use crystal,
some heroin.
It doesn't even matter
Stef and Lena are never gonna let me see them again.
They made that perfectly clear.
It's too bad.
I think it's a mistake, not just for you.
What would you say to them?
I mean, if you could?
This is really hard.
You know what? We did a lot of work today.
You... wanna take a break?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Best in town. Well, that's what they say, anyway.
Thanks.
Callie.
What're you doing here?
Oh, we tagged along with Brandon and Lou.
They're here, too? Where are they?
Oh, I don't know we split up with them a little while ago.
We're gonna meet them later though for the concert.
Oh yay! We'll join you.
Hey, you know what I think we need?
I think we need some dulce de leche, something sweet.
Yeah, no, I think that's exactly what we need.
Hey, but no puking! Puking's against the rules!
I don't wanna be one to toot my own horn.
Generally, I prefer you to do that.
But since you're not here, I guess I'm going to have
to indulge in a little self-congratulation.
Check out that pipe!
Look at that! No more leaky pipe!
No more emptying the bowl into the toilet anymore.
How hot is that pipe, huh? How hot is that pipe?
And how hot is your mama, huh?
In her hot tool belt? In her hot tool belt?
Using power tools, oh, yeah, fixing things.
Look at that pipe. Look at that pipe.
Oh, crap!
Oh, crap!
That's intense.
You should get one.
One: I'm not 18 and two: I'd like to live to be 18,
which I don't think would happen
if my moms found out I got one of those.
You don't have to be 18,
for the record, not at a place like this.
Really?
Nice. What is it?
It's a Triple Spiral. It's the wiccan symbol of feminine power.
I've got another one, but I can't really show it to you here.
Uh, what time does stuff start on the main stage?
So you're not into me? Is that what's happening?
Because it's either that or you're completely oblivious,
and I'm pretty sure you're not that stupid.
No, I...
I mean, I basically just offered to let you see me naked.
I'm not oblivious, OK, and I'm not stupid. I'm just...
You're not over Callie?
No.
Not into me?
No.
Then what?
Hey, Brandon, Liam's here.
What?
Liam's here!
What...? Hang on, Wyatt?
I gotta go.
Who's Liam?
He's this guy who... I'll tell you later, all right?
Wyatt? Hey, slow down. What are you doing?
I saw him over there. I lost him.
You were following him?
Yeah. I don't want Callie to see him.
Then let's grab Callie and get outta here.
No why should Callie be the one who has to leave?
Hey, dude, think about this. This is not a good idea.
Hey, the concert's about to start, do you think we could...
You guys go ahead, yeah, I'm sure Wyatt's just gonna be a second.
I'll meet you there. Save us a seat though.
OK. Hurry.
Uh, can we stop by the ladies room on our way?
Pardon me.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Whoa! What are you guys doing here?
I told you I was coming here this morning.
Never mind. Damn it. I gotta go.
So you did a bunch of research, huh?
Was that just stealing your brother's idea,
or was there more to it than that?
So really you just wanted to use me? For sex?
No. No. That's not it at all. I like you. I really like you.
You know, there are plenty of guys out there
that would treat me like this.
I thought you were different.
I am, I really am different.
I mean it. What do I have to do to prove it to you?
So you wanna make sure it's in there as close as you can get it.
And give it a whack.
I shouldn't say "whack."
I mean, tap it, very gently.
Well, look who's here? Hey, Mike!
Ana and I...
We're working the program together.
I got 60 days, 60 days clean.
I wrote Stef and Lena. I wrote your moms.
I told them I wanted to see you, and Jesus
just to tell you how sorry I am.
I can't. I don't wanna... I can't do this...
Whoa whoa, let's just go somewhere and talk, OK?
Why? So she can lie to me again?
No. No.
Hey, Mariana!
Mariana? Hey! Hey!
What's going on? Are you OK?
No, I'm not. Why did you bring me here?
Is it because I'm not Latin enough?
Is it because I dyed my hair? Why?
No, I brought you here because I love it.
I wanted to share it with you.
Oh, because I'm Mexican? If I were Korean,
would you take me to Koreatown?
If I wanted good barbecue, yeah.
OK, I don't get it, are you offended
that I brought you to a festival
that actually celebrates your culture?
I mean, it's not like I made you wear a sombrero
and do tequila shots.
Well, I'm sorry, this isn't my culture.
Didn't you show me a picture of your Quinceanera?
That was just a party.
Look, I grew up with Stef and Lena.
I didn't eat churros, or dance flamenco...
Flamenco's not Mexican.
Don't do that! See? This is what I mean!
This isn't me. I don't have any connection to any of this!
I don't feel anything!
Well, you clearly feel something.
Why are you yelling at me?
Is this about that woman? Who was that?
Hey, Liam.
You need to get the hell out of here.
Callie is here. I don't want her seeing you.
So for once in your life,
do the right thing and get the hell outta here.
Why don't you get out?
Man, haven't you put her through enough?
What about what she put me through? Huh?
What are you talking about?
Accusing me like she did,
dragging me into court, in front of my parents
and the whole freaking world.
So what, you're saying you didn't rape her?
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
I had sex with her, but trust me, she wanted it.
Hey! Hey! Wyatt, stop! Stop!
Come on! Hey, break it up!
Hey, that's enough!
Want me to call the cops?
No.
OK, folks, move on.
Show's over.
Well, that was something.
That guy, he, um...
...did some bad stuff to Callie.
And you just had to jump in to defend her.
I'm kidding. I'm sure you had your reasons.
You're pretty rock-n-roll, Foster.
I mean, you're an idiot, but... Come on.
I'm sorry.
I'm just kind of in a bad place right now. I can't.
It's not you, OK?
And it's not Callie.
It's me.
I promise. I'm sorry.
Let's get outta here.
Callie! Hey!
What? What did I do?
I was just trying to protect you.
I know.
Then what did I do wrong?
That's not the kind of protection I want, Wyatt.
I told you, OK? I needed you today.
I needed you. To be with me.
I told myself that I could trust you but I guess I was wrong.
You know how I feel about violence,
or do you not remember me screaming at you
the last time that you picked a fight with Liam.
I can't believe we're having this fight again.
I was...
I was just trying to take care of you, Callie.
Well, maybe you don't know how to do that.
Oh, God!
Hey honey.
I'm just calling to say that I got you video.
I sent it?
Yeah, I called the plumber. He's on the way.
OK, thank you.
Hey, are you OK?
I miss the baby.
We didn't even know her and I miss her so much.
I know, me too.
Thanks for the heads up.
What the hell happened?
That hurts.
It's supposed to hurt.
What are you doin', getting in fights, anyway?
Your hand just got better...
I know, I know. I was trying to stop it, honest.
But...
...once I saw Liam, I got so mad, I...
I couldn't.
Who you really mad at, B? Liam?
Sure, maybe.
He deserves some anger, but I gotta say,
I don't think that's really what this was about.
I think you're mad at me.
And I think you're mad at yourself.
I want you to forgive yourself for what happened with Dani.
And I want you to forgive me for
bringing her into our lives in the first place.
I'm so sorry, Dad.
I know you are.
I'm sorry, too.
You can't avoid hurting the people you love.
That's... that's just what happens.
That's... that's family.
But I got a feeling we're gonna be
making amends to each other for the rest of our lives.
The only thing that matters is we keep doing it.
No, that can't have been fun, seeing Liam.
You all right, my love?
And Wyatt, how is he?
Um, a little bruised but he'll be fine.
I get that he was just trying to protect me, but another fight?
What good is that gonna do anyone, you know?
You're so amazing, you know that? You come here.
You and me, we're a lot alike.
We think we gotta be strong, tough,
think we gotta get on with things and...
You know, sometimes you do
and sometimes...
Sometimes, you just gotta let yourself fall apart.
And there's no shame in that. Not even a little.
Mariana, is that you?
Nope, it's just me.
Oh. Where you been all day?
Just out with Hayley.
Have you talked with your sister?
Mariana? No, why?
I'll talk to you about it later.
OK. I should get back to that paper I was working on.
Yeah, you should. You been talking about that all day.
What am I gonna do with him?
I don't know.
I don't know either.
I don't hate being Latin.
I mean, how could you?
I just...
Ana's the only connection I have to being Mexican, you know?
And I hate her so much.
If you knew half of what she's done to my family...
I just think today, you know, seeing all of this,
it just reminded me of her,
the part of me that makes me feel so awful about myself.
I'm sorry I was such a bitch today.
No.
Remember when I told you how my dad left when I was six?
Well, my mom always used to tell us
it had nothing to do with us,
that he was a total mess with a ton of problems.
But even so,
I still can't believe he's never called,
he's never come by,
not even to make sure we were alive, you know?
I shouldn't care but...
...I just think if...
...if I could hear him say I'm sorry...
...just once, that would be something, you know?
Hey. How was it?
Good. It was good.
Mike stopped by and he said that he ran into you.
And he was with Ana.
Did she really send you a letter,
asking if she could see us?
She did.
Well I want to.
See her.
