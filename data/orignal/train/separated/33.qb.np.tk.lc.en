um ... he &apos;ll be out in a minute .

my dad &apos;s right here .
no , it was a skateboard .
it &apos;s okay . i got you .
no , he never left .
my dad &apos;s with my brother .
he &apos;s bleeding .
grace , what are you doing ?
keeping dad .
now i &apos;m going to talk to you .
it &apos;s amal , right ?
amal . yeah .
now , when you first arrived at the apartment ,
did you , uh , see mr. florrick ?
yes .
you &apos;re sure .
yeah , he just , uh , got out of the shower .
now , your mother is the building manager ?
yes , uh ,
on the fourth floor . i came up because , um ,
we got some complaints about the noise .
do you have some i.d. ?
what were you thinking ?
they were going to arrest dad .
um ... hello .
these are beautiful bookcases .
are you with the police ?
mrs. florrick , your daughter said the hmd sent a false positive ,
because your son was ... attempting a crooked grind
and slammed into it .
sheriff , she &apos;s just a kid .
meaning what ? she &apos;s lying ?
uh , sheriff , if i could interrupt .
good evening , first of all .
i &apos;m going to ask mr. and mrs. florrick
not to answer any more of your questions .
uh , mrs. florrick , i &apos;m daniel golden &apos;s partner .
and i ask that all questions be directed through me .
well , i could take mr. florrick in right now .
yes , and where was mr. florrick when you arrived ?
um ... he failed to answer his hmd call .
due to the fact that his son was injured in a skateboarding accident .
again , where did you find mr. florrick ?
excuse me , we received a warning that the perimeter had been breached .
due to a malfunctioning unit .
you found mr. florrick in his apartment .
&apos;cause he returned .
or never left .
hey , who installed the hmd unit ?
who installed it ? i did . why ?
do you know what an ohs clip is ?
an itty @-@ bitty wire clip about this big .
it &apos;s required by the sheriff &apos;s department whenever an hmd is installed .
one clip for every one foot of wire .
do you know how much wire you installed ?
who are you ?
elsbeth tascioni .
hi .
you installed , by my eye , three feet of wire .
and do you know how many ohs clips you installed ?
none .
people don &apos;t like permanent fixtures in their houses .
well , that &apos;s very kind of you , sheriff .
but it &apos;s still an infraction .
and unfortunately in this case ,
your loose wire is what tripped up
young mr. florrick &apos;s skateboard causing his injury .
thank you .
you know ,
i wish i had an eye with color .
i &apos;m always mixing oranges with reds .
is that you ?
is that ...
will .
hey . is everything all right ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s been such chaos around here .
it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;ll talk tomorrow .
hey , sadie .
sorry for flaking out on you tonight .
no , my emergency fell through .
do you want to ...
what favor ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
we &apos;re not going toward your floor .
what we have here is a rather large
collection of items with your name on them .
you don &apos;t need to be nervous .
i &apos;m your friend here .
they aren &apos;t mine .
really .
look , the sheriff ran your i.d. last night , amal .
it triggered a red flag warning to me .
you see , there are a dozen credit cards ,
driver &apos;s licenses , passports with your name on &apos; em .
you know how that could &apos;ve happened ?
no . i don &apos;t .
were you paid to let someone use your identity ?
simran ?
are you certain ?
is everything okay ?
yes , alicia . um , they just ...
they have a few questions , um , for amal .
it &apos;s about work .
do you ... do you want me to do anything ?
oh . no .
i don &apos;t know .
they said it would only take a minute , and so ...
amal isn &apos;t in trouble .
you don &apos;t want to get in trouble , amal .
no .
then why aren &apos;t you answering honestly ?
i am answering honestly .
i don &apos;t know anything about this .
i swear .
excuse me , gentlemen .
is amal a suspect here ?
because if so , you probably should read him his rights .
not a suspect ... at this time .
we &apos;re asking a few questions . that &apos;s all .
mrs. florrick , isn &apos;t it ?
y @-@ yes .
you just accused him of being dishonest ,
and warned him he could get into trouble .
we &apos;re trying to ascertain his connection
to an identity theft ring .
simran ,
i think you should invite these gentlemen to leave .
we only need a few more minutes , mrs. verma .
if you don &apos;t want them here , you can ask them to leave , simran .
gentlemen ...
would you please leave ?
my guess is they &apos;re just fishing .
look , i @-@ i didn &apos;t do anything wrong , mom .
i swear .
i have to rush to work ,
but if you need anything , just call me , okay ?
thank you , alicia .
of course .
does he have a moment ?
actually , will &apos;s out today .
he &apos;s ... oh , court ?
no , volunteer work .
all very last minute .
he &apos;s out until thursday .
thursday ?
so this is the favor ?
for an old college chum .
very hot .
that &apos;s right .
you have a thing for judges .
my first husband .
it &apos;s not half bad .
i wonder if i can get it fitted .
objection , your honor .
uh , calls for speculation .
the question asks mr. hunter to guess the answer
rather than rely on facts .
yes , that is the definition of speculation .
congratulations , mr. bigelow .
too bad i didn &apos;t do that .
sustained .
exception .
noted , and when you go to mock trial appeal court ,
ms. cabrini , you can argue it there .
now , mr. hunter ,
i just want to understand the sequence of events .
you say that you saw my clients entering the cottage ?
yes . i was hunting in the forest when i heard a scream .
actually , you said &quot; screams &quot; ?
yes . screams .
and you said that you recognize those as belonging to the witch ?
that &apos;s right . she lives in that gingerbread house .
oh . so you just assumed
that it was the witch &apos;s scream coming from inside the oven ?
no . i recognized her voice .
oh . so you have the power to distinguish between screams ?
well , how about this one ?
objection ! your honor !
ms. cabrini !
sustained .
sustained , what ?
what &apos;s the objection ?
badgering the witness .
you &apos;re arguing the prosecution &apos;s case , your honor .
excuse me , ms. cabrini .
i am not doing anything of the sort .
okay , let &apos;s leave it there . we &apos;ll pick it up tomorrow .
now , remember ,
even though this is a mock trial ,
i do not want the jury discussing the case .
this is not a joke .
grades depend on its outcome .
and let &apos;s thank our judge , mr. will gardner , for volunteering his time .
anyone else have a problem with the argument on page 18 , mid @-@ page ?
you mean mine ?
well , i didn &apos;t know it was yours .
i just find the citing &apos;s a bit off topic .
our clients are suing because their video game was stolen .
that &apos;s all .
well , i &apos;m here to listen , cary ,
so why don &apos;t you tell me how my citings could be more on topic ?
well ...
one minute .
what &apos;s up ?
nothing . neighborhood kids need help .
want me to get rid of them ?
no , thank you .
billable hours , alicia .
cary &apos;s got his eye on the prize .
billable hours .
thanks , kalinda .
sorry , but we didn &apos;t know who else to contact .
that &apos;s okay . what happened ?
they came for her an hour after you left .
they can &apos;t just take her away .
can they ?
this was about me .
they want me .
wait . who came ?
mom was going to the grocery store
when this van ...
these men got out and took her .
all we got was this phone number to call .
the line &apos;s been busy all day .
i thought your ...
your mom &apos;s a citizen , right ?
she spent $ 8,000 on an immigration attorney who ripped her off
and never filed for a green card ,
so she just gave up .
she &apos;s lived here for 27 years .
look , i have some names of immigration attorneys .
i &apos;ll get them for you .
thank you .
thanks .
this way .
you &apos;re such a pushover .
i am not .
i &apos;m responsible .
no , i mean , i &apos;m responsible for the feds questioning him .
you &apos;re not responsible for everything bad in the world , alicia .
where would they put her , the mom ?
broadview , mchenry detention ,
general population at cook county .
they make it a shell game .
but you could find her ?
so you &apos;re the pushover , i &apos;m the one who actually does the work ?
no , no . it &apos;s fine . i can do it .
thank you .
mama ?
thanks .
hey , my good deed for the year .
thank you , mrs. florrick .
please stand on the lines .
all rise , please .
the honorable judge gordon tomlin presiding .
i &apos;m judge tomlin ,
presiding immigration judge via closed @-@ circuit in miami .
currently presiding over cook county i.c.e.
are we ready , miss ... ?
bow . yes , your honor .
i.c.e. is petitioning the court
for summary judgment on simran verma &apos;s immediate removal
and deportation to her native india .
your honor , i &apos;m sorry ,
but simran has lived in america for 27 years .
too loud for the microphone , ma &apos;am .
mrs. verma has demonstrated good moral character .
she supports herself as a building manager ,
and she would be subjected to undue hardship
if she were separated from her american @-@ born children .
she more than qualifies for an adjusted residence status .
your honor , i have a copy
of simran &apos;s application for a driver &apos;s license from the dmv .
on the application , she checked the voter registration box ,
thus making a false claim of citizenship , a federal offense .
your honor , these forms are confusing and often filled out by rote .
the application clearly states
that making a false claim is a serious federal offense .
mrs. verma should be permanently inadmissible
as a citizen of the united states .
your honor , her ties to america are very strong .
too close for the microphone again , ma &apos;am .
summary judgment approved .
mrs. verma &apos;s deportation is approved .
next case .
oh , your honor ... but , your ...
what ?
what is happening ?
is that it ?
are they taking her back ?
mrs. florrick ?
what happened ? wait . wait .
mom .
what has happened ?
you can &apos;t take her !
mom !
mom !
this is absurd . i am not a criminal .
mr. belkin !
so that &apos;s what this is about .
i won &apos;t confirm or deny ,
but , ma &apos;am , it would have been better if you &apos;d let us question him .
what do you want ?
identity theft is a multi @-@ billion dollar burr in the side of america .
all i ask is that amal do his patriotic duty ,
help us bring down the major player .
he does that , you stop his mother &apos;s deportation ?
i &apos;ll put in a good word .
that &apos;s the problem with good deeds--
they multiply .
what ? i got it cleaned .
so this is why you dropped all of your appointments for the next two days ?
hey , i &apos;m doing good for the community ,
and i &apos;m keeping an eye on law school prospects .
and of course , there &apos;s always your good friend , professor sadie hart .
you know what ?
i &apos;m not a bad judge .
what &apos;s the case ?
the mock trial ?
it &apos;s a ... a murder .
yeah . double defendants .
brother and sister .
and the victim ?
a homeowner .
it &apos;s a fairy tale , isn &apos;t it ?
hansel and gretel .
but it brings up some interesting legal issues :
trespass , castle law .
eating other people &apos;s houses ?
oh , will , alicia dropped by yesterday wanting a few minutes .
okay . got it . thanks .
we are going to have to deal with that , too .
that ?
the junior associate position .
cary and alicia .
we said six months ; it &apos;s been seven .
it &apos;s bad economy to drop somebody .
are you getting cold feet ?
next week .
next week .
they think your work is a front for selling stolen i.d. &apos; s .
the travel agency ?
they traced the false i.d. &apos; s to that address .
have you seen anything there ?
no .
but ... i haven &apos;t wanted to see .
he &apos;ll get our mom a visa-- this belkin-- if amal cooperates ?
yeah .
the feds want you to download three files
from your boss &apos;s computer :
pal @-@ one , two , three .
it &apos;s mom .
you have to . amal .
i know .
you don &apos;t know what these guys are capable of .
i don &apos;t know why you think you &apos;re the only one ... !
you seem less than sympathetic .
their mother &apos;s illegal .
with 27 years in this country .
27 years of being illegal .
i would &apos;ve thought you would &apos;ve been more sympathetic .
why ?
because my parents immigrated legally , you thought
i &apos;d be more sympathetic to someone who immigrated here illegally ?
my mistake .
so , who are they ?
big case .
can &apos;t talk about it .
yeah ?
they &apos;re the video game clients , right ?
can &apos;t talk about it .
well , do you need some help with it ?
because i know the gamer world .
lucky you .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t call you back right away .
i &apos;m on this mock trial thing at depaul .
oh , that &apos;s all right .
i was just making sure everything was all right after the other night .
one minute .
everything is all right .
you sure ?
because ... i &apos;m sorry .
alicia , you don &apos;t have any reason to be sorry .
i was pushing a situation that was wrong to push .
you weren &apos;t .
i was .
don &apos;t worry .
we &apos;re good .
we &apos;re going to be good .
pal @-@ one , two , three ?
yes , just three files .
that &apos;s all they want .
you won &apos;t be alone .
look .
they don &apos;t want to arrest them ;
they want to do this quietly , in and out .
did you tell them about the pujari brothers ?
belkin knows that your bosses are potentially dangerous .
he also knows you did nothing wrong .
he &apos;ll keep his promise to release my mother ?
we have a deal in writing .
amal ,
take a deep breath , think about your mom .
uh , do you have any direct flights to agra ?
calm down .
when have you ever know someone to calm down
when you tell them to calm down ?
could you turn the screen toward me
so i can see the direct flights to agra , please ?
oh , found it .
download it .
they &apos;re exiting the building .
hold it , hold it .
federal agents !
hold it right there . put your hands where i can see them .
get agents in there and sweep the place .
call it in , all right ?
mr. gardner , do you have a moment ?
sure , what do you need ?
what am i doing wrong ?
what are you ...
i didn &apos;t know you were doing anything wrong .
there were 38 objections and i lost 34,
so what am i doing ?
well , at the moment what you &apos;re doing is playing the ref .
tell me , teach me .
you want me to tell you why i &apos;m deciding against you ?
yes , half of those objections could have gone either way .
that &apos;s not true .
where are you from , chicago ?
is this important for the lesson ?
it &apos;s important for a life lesson .
judge asks you a question , you answer .
you don &apos;t come back with another question .
why ?
because court is a lesson
in humility , and you just came back with another question .
so you &apos;re deciding against me because i &apos;m not humble ?
no , i &apos;m deciding against you because you &apos;re wrong on the law ,
but life is not the classroom
and judges decide things all the time based on a whim--
which attorneys they like , they trust .
oh , so you don &apos;t like me ?
oh , my god , you &apos;re like a three @-@ year @-@ old with the questions .
i said the textbooks go
out the window when you &apos;re in court .
charm and finesse is just as important as logic .
okay , so i need to work on my charm ?
to succeed in court ,
you need to work on everything .
okay .
then what ?
let &apos;s see .
cross @-@ examination .
what ?
hey , i &apos;m a big gamer .
in college they used to call me the thumb @-@ meister .
grand theft auto , you know .
thanks , man .
what do you mean you &apos;re not releasing simran ?
we had a deal .
right , we had a deal .
your boy blew it apart .
what ?
amal got you the data .
he also warned the pujari brothers to get out .
no , he didn &apos;t .
someone sent them a text .
well , you still got what you wanted .
you made your arrest .
i didn &apos;t want to bust the brothers .
i wanted their buyer .
we only arrested them so they wouldn &apos;t take off on us .
now the whole operation is scattered .
because of your client , eight months of work is shot to hell .
and simran , what about simran ?
deportation .
oh , come on , this ...
ma &apos;am ,
you know what this is ? it &apos;s the law .
she broke the law and now she &apos;s paying the consequences .
mrs. florrick .
gerald kozko ?
yes , i know who you are .
i only need a minute .
i &apos;m leaving now .
please , i ...
i want you to give your husband a message .
i want you to tell him
that my son had nothing to do with this .
i was the one that made the deal with childs .
i &apos;m cleaning up my mess .
my son is completely ...
no .
mrs. florrick ...
no , that &apos;s it , mr. kozko , i &apos;m not your go @-@ between .
you want to give peter a message , pick up the phone .
mrs. florrick , you don &apos;t realize ...
yes , and i don &apos;t want to realize .
i &apos;ve had enough of everything .
you don &apos;t understand ; i don &apos;t have anybody .
you know what ?
i don &apos;t care .
i don &apos;t know you .
you don &apos;t know me .
help me .
okay ,
family meeting .
we &apos;re going to settle some things .
from now on ...
we tell each other the truth .
no more lying to the sheriff about skateboards
or to me about secret packages .
okay ?
where &apos;s dad ?
this isn &apos;t about him ; this is about us .
so i &apos;ll go first .
i &apos;ve been very angry with your father .
i almost walked out a few nights ago ,
but we &apos;ve decided to give it a go .
in separate rooms ?
yes , and you two will just have to deal with that .
you &apos;re almost grown @-@ ups .
you &apos;ll realize that adults have complicated emotions .
zach , your turn .
my turn ?
what &apos;s on your mind ?
mom , it &apos;s really late .
i &apos;m seeing becca .
okay , this is progress .
and i will be honest
in telling you that i don &apos;t like becca ,
but i think you should bring her to dinner
so we can have a proper introduction .
okay .
grace .
who &apos;s will ?
will gardner-- my boss .
i heard you talking to him on the phone
a week ago .
you were whispering at night .
he &apos;s my boss ...
and we used to know each other in college
and we thought that we were attracted to each other ,
but it &apos;s over .
what &apos;s over ?
thinking that we were attracted to each other .
but he &apos;s still your boss .
yes .
so what happened ?
actually , that &apos;s all i intend to share right now .
your father and i are agreeing
to make this work and i have agreed to trust you again ,
so good night .
sweet dreams .
it &apos;s getting to her .
definitely .
yeah , it &apos;s me .
you &apos;re working late .
yeah , on this good deed someone saddled me with .
belkin won &apos;t budge ; i already went to him .
they weren &apos;t after the pujari brothers .
they were after their buyers .
now they &apos;re looking for the go @-@ between .
really ?
then maybe we have something to negotiate with .
okay , go ahead .
did you threaten kozko ?
yes .
downstairs at lord of christ ?
yes .
do you want to know why ?
he was wearing a wire .
he made a deal with childs for immunity .
and why &apos;d he do that ?
i don &apos;t know why .
because you steered investigations away from him ?
everything , peter .
i want to know everything .
everybody has friends , everybody has enemies .
i did things for kozko as a friend .
that were illegal ?
no , but ...
the line gets fuzzy .
who paid for this ?
i did .
then why isn &apos;t the receipt in your name ?
i went to the store , peter .
i wanted to get you something nice ...
i didn &apos;t have the money .
kozko lent me the money .
and that was illegal .
that was ... fuzzy .
look , alicia ,
i want to run again ,
but i want to do it right this time , nothing fuzzy .
and i only want to do it if you &apos;re with me .
if we &apos;re in this together .
these ? no , i don &apos;t know who handles these .
they look like they were mounted in a necklace or something .
well , your best bet with jewelry is not here .
thanks for your time , anyway .
the box is another matter .
you recognize the box ?
it &apos;s a camphor box .
it &apos;s sold down the street at the mundy bazaar .
thanks .
all rise . the honorable will gardner presiding .
is the defense ready with its first witness ?
yes , your honor . i just have a quick motion first .
proceed .
title 28 , usc @-@ 455a provides :
a judge must recuse himself in any proceeding
in which his impartiality may be reasonably questioned .
the defense asks that you do so now .
recuse yourself .
ms. cabrini , we &apos;ve been through this .
i &apos;m not biased against you .
i agree . you &apos;re biased for me .
really ?
you &apos;re gonna have to explain that one .
well , yesterday after court , you advised me
on how to cross @-@ examine and question
witnesses for this trial , clearly demonstrating bias .
you asked for advice .
united states v. burger .
if a reasonable person knowing the relevant facts
would harbor doubts about a judge &apos;s impartiality ,
he must recuse himself .
motion denied , ms. cabrini .
why don &apos;t we take a break for a minute , mr. gardner .
sadie , she set me up .
okay , i think we &apos;re in an awkward area here , your honor .
what ? i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
thanks so much for your help .
you believe her ?
i believe i &apos;ll take the robe .
yep . men and 25 @-@ year @-@ olds .
same thing happened to my ex .
what are you talking about ?
we think these gems , they &apos;re kashmir blue sapphires ,
were used in payment for the i.d. &apos; s
if we can find the smuggler , we can find the buyer .
and if you find the buyer ?
then belkin will get you a visa .
but they &apos;re deporting me on the next transport .
i know .
my associates are still running these sapphires down .
i ... i don &apos;t know anybody in india , mrs. florrick .
my life ... my life is here .
i know .
can i see amal and frida before i go ?
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m working on it .
please , um ...
mrs. florrick , you have the key to my apartment , no ?
i need a few items , and then ... and the sentimental things .
yes , of course i will .
and will you tell amal it &apos;s not his fault , mm ?
thank you .
cary ?
hi . can you hear me ?
okay , i need you to bring it to me .
what , the gems ?
no , the box . i need you to bring the box .
all right , all right , but i &apos;m just driving around in circles here--
little india &apos;s a nightmare .
i &apos;ll e @-@ mail them to your car , the directions .
all right . hold on , that &apos;s my other line . hello ?
hi , cary . are you near kalinda ?
no . i &apos;m looking for her right now .
and ha @-@ ha , very funny , it &apos;s not about gaming .
wait , hold on a second .
all right , i got it . what do you need ?
tell her i think simran &apos;s involved .
the sapphires used to pay the pujari brothers ,
i found the same jewels in her apartment .
damn it . all right , well , i &apos;ll tell her .
