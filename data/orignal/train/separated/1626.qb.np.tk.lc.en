i don &apos;t see anything at all , sheldon .
well , you &apos;re the doctor , but i am constantly
hearing this annoying sound .
me , too .
is it a high @-@ frequency whistle ?
no , it &apos;s more of a relentless ,
narcissistic drone .
yup , there &apos;s no inflammation at all , sheldon .
then it must be a tumor .
i seriously doubt it .
maybe it &apos;s a lingering bacterial infection
from all those childhood toilet swirlies .
is that possible ? i used to get those all the time .
even in church .
well if it is from a swirly , there something i can do .
okay , circle , circle , dot , dot ,
now you have a cootie shot !
i &apos;m going to bed
okay , i &apos;ll be right in .
it &apos;s not enough that she mocks me , but that isn &apos;t even
the correct procedure for a cootie shot .
do you understand that stephanie &apos;s not here
to treat your imaginary ailments ?
how is it imaginary that i keep hearing
an octave above middle c ?
is that imaginary ?
i don &apos;t think so .
good night .
leonard , there &apos;s one more thing .
under article one , section three of our roommate agreement ,
i &apos;m calling an emergency meeting .
no , you &apos;re not .
leonard moves the meeting not occur .
is there a second ? none heard , the motion fails .
i &apos;d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you
on the progress in your relationship with dr. stephanie .
thank you .
that being said , we have to discuss
the implementation of the agreed upon &quot; cohabitation &quot; rider
whichas been activated now that
the two of you are living together .
we &apos;re not living together .
i beg to disagree
&quot; a girlfriend shall be deemed
quote living with un @-@ quote leonard
when she has stayed over for a : ten consecutive nights ,
or b : more than nine nights in three week period ,
or c : all the weekends of a given month
plus three weeknights .
that &apos;s absurd .
you initialed it . see ? l.h. , l.h. , l.h.
wait , i only initialed it
because i never thought it would happen !
i initialed another clause
naming you my sidekick in case i get superpowers .
hmm , yes , you did .
now , to review the following provisions are hereby activated :
in the refrigerator , as opposed to us having
two separate shelves and one communal shelf ,
the three of us now get individual shelves
and the door becomes communal .
next , apartment vacuuming shall be
increased from two to three times a week
to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells .
third , the bathroom schedule . now , i &apos;m given to understand
women have different needs , so , we &apos;ll have to discuss that .
i &apos;m going to bed .
at least take this with you .
look , and have stephanie initial here , here , here , here ...
and ... here .
this states that she does not now
nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument .
sure sounds like a tumor
pressing on the auditory nerve .
no , absolutely not .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
we have latex gloves .
i don &apos;t care what the symptoms are ,
my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam .
hi , sheldon .
good morning , dr. stephanie .
i trust leonard satisfied you sexually last night .
sheldon , we don &apos;t ask questions like that .
i heard you ask it over and over .
how is it inappropriate for me to ask it once ?
he did very nicely .
see ? she &apos;s not offended .
and now you finally have an answer .
out of coffee . need coffee .
oh , hello .
hi ! stephanie , right ?
uh @-@ huh . and @-@ and- and you are ?
penny , i live across the hall .
i &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
really ? mm @-@ hmm .
i haven &apos;t heard a thing about you .
leonard ?
why haven &apos;t i heard a thing
about this woman who lives across the hall
and comes into your apartment in the morning ... in her underwear ?
she &apos;s heard about you because we &apos;re , you know ,
involved and you haven &apos;t heard about her because ...
i never slept with her , i swear !
in leonard &apos;s defense , it wasn &apos;t for lack of trying .
thank you , sheldon .
you &apos;re welcome , leonard .
look , i &apos;m just saying , um ...
penny is one of our many neighbors , you know ,
and in our building ,
neighbors come and go , it &apos;s very casual , no dress code .
in fact , some mornings i &apos;ll just mosey down to the third floor
in my pajamas and have cereal with mrs. vartabedian .
really ?
i have never once been invited
to have cereal with mrs. vartabedian .
she doesn &apos;t like you .
you have a gall bladder to remove and i have
to get in the shower and penny has clothes to put on , so ...
well , it was very nice meeting you .
nice to finally meet you , too .
and i &apos;ll see you tonight ?
okay , bye @-@ bye .
what could i possibly have done
to offend mrs. vartabedian ?
so , that &apos;s stephanie , huh ?
why do i feel like i &apos;m the one that just got the prostate exam ?
you know , she seems very nice .
oh , she is . she &apos;s terrific .
and she &apos;s proving to be a valuable roommate .
roommate ? you guys are living together ?
like hippies .
we &apos;re not living together .
do i have to pull out the paperwork again ?
we &apos;re not living together .
are you sure ?
how could i not be sure ?
well , let &apos;s find out .
don &apos;t you think if a woman was living with me
i &apos;d be the first one to know about it ?
oh , sweetie , you &apos;d be the last one to know about it .
hmm , cute dresses .
i bet this looks great on you !
we &apos;re not living together .
okay , hmm ...
scented candles , fuzzy slippers ,
ooh ! floral bed sheets ?
we &apos;re not living together .
okay , moving on .
now , who are these guys at disney world ?
uh , the big dog is goofy ,
but the older couple with the mouse ears , i have no idea .
we &apos;re not living together !
you &apos;re going to go down swinging , huh ?
all right , well , we got your body lotion ,
your instyle magazine , your jewelry box .
we &apos;re not--
where &apos;s my bat signal ?
you have a bat signal ?
i did . it was right here .
she must &apos;ve-- oh , my god , we &apos;re living together .
really ? what was your first clue ?
new pants ?
yeah , sthanie got them for me .
nice . cotton ?
actually , i think it &apos;s more of wool , fire ant blend .
so , the girlfriend &apos;s buying clothes for you , huh ?
sounds serious .
it is actually .
in fact , i gave it a lot of thought
and i decided it was time for us to live together .
ba oh , leonard , huge mistake .
there &apos;s a whole buffet of women out there and you &apos;re just
standing in the corner eating the same deviled egg
over and over again .
at least i have an egg . what do you have ?
a veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners .
see the blonde over there ?
i can hit on her and you can &apos;t .
so , go hit on her .
she &apos;s not my type .
too bad , &apos; cause she was checking you out before .
she was ?
of course not . look at her .
i don &apos;t care what you guys think .
stephanie and i are very happy living together .
i will give either of you 20 dollars , right now
to trade pants with me .
sheldon , what are you doing here ?
hang on .
130 over 80 . a little high .
we can attribute that to the stress
of sneaking past the security desk .
where did you get the stethoscope
and the blood pressure cuff ?
my aunt marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday .
she thought if i failed at theoretical physics
that i should have a trade to fall back on .
and by the way , the blood pressure cuff
is called a sphygmomanometer .
thank you .
didn &apos;t they teach you that in medical school ?
i &apos;m kinda busy here , sheldon .
i understand .
all i need is for you to authorize these tests .
a cardiac stress test , a full body mri ,
anlectromyogram , a cbc , baseline glucose .
upper gi ?
oh , and an exploratory laparoscopy .
last time i had hiccups , it felt like my diaphragm
was just going through the motions .
go home , sheldon .
can i at least have the upper gi ?
i already drank the barium !
oh , good . do you have any fabric softener ?
yeah , sure .
what are you washing ? a crocodile ?
no , the pants that stephanie got me .
oh , sweetie , you can &apos;t machinwash these .
they &apos;ll be ruined .
are you sure ?
absolutely .
oh , no . i wish you &apos;d told me that sooner .
are you guys having problems ?
no , everything &apos;s fine .
really ?
yeah . it &apos;s wonderful .
okay , maybe this whole living together
happened kind of suddenly , but it &apos;s fine , it &apos;s great .
okay , leonard , honey , you know ,
if you &apos;re uncomfortable with the way things are going ,
you &apos;re allowed to say something .
are you sure ? that doesn &apos;t sound right .
believe me , your feelings are just as important as hers .
no that doesn &apos;t sound right either .
just tell her you need the relationship to move
at a pace that you both are comfortable with .
yeah , i could say something like that to her .
i &apos;ll go do that .
thank you .
sure .
you have a really good grasp on this .
maybe you could talk to her ?
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
no , but that &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ll go talk to her .
want to come with ?
go !
oh , no .
whaa ? ?
you were right . your larynx is terribly inflamed .
i mean , i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
i knew it !
what do i do ? !
you &apos;re going to need to stop talking immediately .
for how-- dut @-@ dut @-@ dut .
immediately .
hey . oh , hi , honey .
sheldon .
what &apos;s going on ?
i just performed a &quot; sheldonectomy . &quot;
careful , if you don &apos;t get it all , it &apos;ll only come back worse .
gotcha .
listen , we need to talk .
do we need to talk or &quot; do we need to talk &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know what that means .
okay , why don &apos;t you just tell me
what it is you have to tell me ?
okay , um , well , look , it &apos;s just that ...
things between you and me have been going pretty quick .
and ... ?
it &apos;s just a little scary .
well , yeah , but scary good , right ?
sure ...
when is scary not good ?
but ... okay , um , i have feelings , right ?
okay , and it &apos;s perfectly okay
to express those feelings , right ?
of course honey why don &apos;t you tell me
what it is you &apos;re feeling ?
okay , well , i ju ... i think it &apos;s important to remember
that we move at a pace that is our speed
and-- oh , shoot , i had it !
okay , how about this ?
how about i tell you what i &apos;m feeling ?
what &apos;s that ?
really ? right now ?
why not ?
i just ate , aren &apos;t you supposed to wait an hour ?
i think that &apos;s for swimming .
oh , okay .
i just hope i don &apos;t get cramps .
oh , i put your clothes in the dryer .
thank you .
your pants are ruined .
good .
so , how did the talk with stephanie go ?
well , um , on one level , really , really well .
so , you told her you wanted to slow things down ?
not specifically ,
but , uh , i did tell her that i had feelings .
good , good . and then what ?
and then , uh , the subject got changed somehow .
you had sex , didn &apos;t you ?
um ... little bit .
what ?
nothing .
okay , well , it sounds like things are going to work out .
yeah , it &apos;s all good .
everything &apos;s going to work out .
one way or another .
come on , leonard ,
you are entitled to try and make
things go the way you want them to .
really ?
yes !
you don &apos;t always have to go along with what the woman wants .
what ?
nothing . just ... rethinking my whole life .
okay , here &apos;s the thing .
i &apos;m afraid that if i ask her to move out , she &apos;ll just dump me .
well , it &apos;s a chance you have to take .
i mean , look , if it &apos;s meant to be , it &apos;ll be .
very comforting .
okay , so what do i say to her ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , what have women said to you
when they wanted to slow a relationship down ?
i really like you ,
but i want to see how things go with mark ?
yeah , that &apos;ll slow it down .
i &apos;m sorry , i totally interrupted you .
what were you saying ?
oh , right , yeah , um ...
so , stephanie , here &apos;s the thing .
i really like you .
oh , god , here comes the speech .
what speech ?
&quot; i really like you ,
&quot; but maybe we should spend a little less time together
&quot; &apos; cause i need my space
but i &apos;ll call you on tuesday &quot;
and then you never call me
so i call you , but you don &apos;t call me back
and then when i run into you at the coffee shop ,
you pretend like you &apos;ve been having problems
with your voice mail and i know that you &apos;re lying ,
but i pretend like i don &apos;t care
even though i &apos;m dying inside !
no !
no , no ! i wasn &apos;t going to say any of that .
i was just going to say ...
i really like you .
oh , good !
&apos;cause i really like you , too .
terrific .
hey .
hey.- hey .
nice sweater .
yeah , stephanie got it for me . it &apos;s kind of fun .
it &apos;s got a big bird on it , dude .
yeah , yeah , that &apos;s the fun part .
we &apos;re also getting new curtains for my bedroom ,
and a dust ruffle , and a duvet ,
and i don &apos;t even know what a duvet is ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure if i did i wouldn &apos;t want one ,
but every time i talk to her about moving out ,
she cries and we have sex .
you &apos;re lucky . with me , it &apos;s usually the other way around .
you know , if you can &apos;t talk to her ,
why don &apos;t you just text her ?
isn &apos;t that kind of cowardly ?
oh , yeah . it &apos;s beyond contemptible .
it &apos;s true ,
but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater .
sold .
&quot; i think it would be better for our relationship
if you moved back to your place . &quot;
there . it &apos;s done .
good for you .
yeah , good for me . i &apos;ll never have sex again .
i was wrong.see ya .
penny .
penny .
penny .
sheldon ?
computer : i have an inflamed larynx .
okay ?
computer : we &apos;re out of herbal tea . do you have any ?
okay , let me check .
computer : some hiney would be nice , too .
