It's the perfect hideaway--
an empty bed and breakfast,
I think we should go check it out.
Are you stopping?
No.
I'm not doing anything.
The engine stopped working.
Maggie is trying to prevent me from seeing Malcolm.
I didn't know that you wanted that.
Sorry.
Maybe we should give this a little more time.
I'm officer Holbrooke.
My partner and I are investigating the murders of Officer Reynolds
and Detective Wilden.
We could have this place.
It could be our secret.
Look, I took pictures of some of the stories in Ali's journal
before "A" got it.
Ali wants to meet me tonight.
Well, you're not going alone.
That's the only way she'll meet me.
Did you tell anyone about this?
I can't believe you followed me here.
She can trust you but not the rest of us?
She's trying to divide us.
You're doing a really good job of that all on your own.
I'm sorry.
Don't!
Well, I missed, like, half the movie.
That dude that was sitting in front of us
kept making sales calls.
Sales calls? I thought he was breaking up with somebody.
He was. His car.
I swear, if Spencer was there,
she would've pegged him with her jelly beans.
Okay, I'm sorry.
But seriously. You cannot hold onto this.
Spencer was just trying to protect you.
No, she was trying to control the situation.
Like she always does.
Emily, look, she thought that you were making a mistake.
I did. By trusting her.
Em...
No, I was this close
to finding out from Alison
what happened that night she disappeared.
And now we'll never hear from her again.
Mike?
What the hell is this?
Dad said I could have a few friends over.
This is not a "few friends."
Aria, chill.
No, I'm not "chillin'"!
Dad left me in charge for the weekend,
and I don't wanna spend the next two days
peeling pepperoni off the walls.
Uh, hello?
This is somebody's desk.
Move it!
Okay, people are still eating.
Well, tell them it's take-out. I'm going upstairs, okay?
You have ten minutes to clear all this people out of here.
All right?
Come on, Em.
Yeah?
Hey, in Ali's story about her date with an older guy,
are they talking about
"Novels and travel" or "Shovels and gravel"?
I'm trying to piece this together.
Her handwriting is so sloppy.
It's like doing mad libs in reverse.
But Ali on a date with a mystery dude,
it seems kind of important.
Okay, well, the "mystery dude"
we should be focusing on is Patterson.
Patterson? Isn't that that kid in world history
who's always sniffing his fingers?
No, James Patterson, the author.
This guy just gets the criminal mind.
Okay, first of all,
when were you interested in anybody born before 1989?
Think about it.
The person who tried to kill Alison
dumped some random into a hole
and tried to make her look like Ali.
Maybe we shouldn't refer to the dead girl as a "random."
Look, if we follow the trail of "A"'s cover-up,
it could lead us right back to "A."
Spencer, this guy's a genius.
It's the third book of his I've read this week.
Is Travis reading them to you?
No. I'm not seeing him anymore.
I decided not to rush into anything.
Wait, so you stayed home to read a book
instead of going to that chick-flick with Aria and Emily?
Well, I wasn't invited.
Why?
Why?
Because Emily is so pissed at you
that she's pissed at me for not being pissed at you.
Where is your dad anyway?
He's teaching in Syracuse.
I swear, the next time he's out of town,
I am so staying at your place.
Hello there.
What are you doing here?
Using the restroom facilities.
I don't have a toilet in my bedroom, Mona.
What are you doing in my house?
I was invited here.
By Mike.
Mike invited you?
Here? Why?
This may come as a shock to you, Emily,
but some people don't tuck 'n roll every time I walk into a room.
Love your wallpaper, by the way.
It's so you.
Mike.
What's up?
Can you come in for a sec?
Look, I promise I'm not trying to be a hard-ass, okay?
We just-- we haven't really had a chance to talk about last night.
I'll finish cleaning after school.
Wait.
What's the deal with Mona?
Uh, we met in a group at school.
And we have a lot of friends in common.
What group?
It's a discussion group.
In the counseling center.
We meet up after school and talk about stuff.
Like what? Terror-tactics?
Mr. Fazelli knows Mona's past.
Fazelli retired.
There's a new counselor and he's actually cool.
Well, I'm not cool with you cozying up to someone
who spent junior year torturing me.
I mean, seriously. Was Mona here to poop or snoop?
All right, I've gotta go.
Mona is a very dangerous person, Mike.
She wasn't sent to Radley for spa treatments.
Are you finished?
Mona broke up our parents, all right?
She's the one who wrote to mom about dad and Meredith.
Our parents broke themselves up, Aria.
Maybe it's time you let go of that and stop judging.
How am I...
People make mistakes, okay?
I've done a lot of crap that I'm not real proud of myself.
And I'm sure someone's standing right now in another bedroom,
talking smack about me.
There's no comparison.
Mona tried to destroy our family.
Well, if you've forgiven dad,
why can't you forgive the messenger?
Hey, sweetie.
I went and I spoke with the mechanic myself.
Did he say why it stopped?
Well, he said it was some kind of computer glitch.
But I drove it home and it runs fine.
Dad, it was working fine that night.
Then suddenly the GPS had, like,
a stroke or something and the engine stopped.
Well, he said something probably triggered the anti-theft device
and shut it down from a remote location.
Baby, you're just driving it to school.
I think if you stay close, it'll be fine.
I'll take my bike.
You know, um...
I would've taken a temporary furlough sooner
if I'd known how shaken up you were about things.
I'm not shaken up.
Emily, a car plowed into the living room,
almost killing you and your ma.
And the fact that the police don't know who was driving...
It has nothing to do with the accident.
Well, something's not right.
You're not eating, you're acting jumpy.
It's called senior year, okay?
I don't know what school I'm going to.
There's a lot of questions.
I'll get through it.
Okay. I'd still like you to drive to school.
They say it's gonna rain later.
I'm taking my bike. Thanks.
So what exactly was the problem?
The landlord's being a jerk because I broke the lease.
He's withholding my deposit till I give back all the keys.
Maybe I could pick up Malcolm early
while you deal with the landlord.
Malcolm's not here. He's at home.
As in Seattle?
Yes, as in Seattle. That's home.
I thought you were bringing him back.
I changed my mind.
I'm just here to deal with the lease
and ship back some boxes I left in storage.
So, what're you saying, Maggie?
That I'm not gonna have a connection to Malcolm
unless it's through an attorney?
Oh, um... I'll just come back later.
No, we're done. I was just leaving.
I'm sorry, I didn't know that she was here.
No, that's okay. That was not going to a good place.
How can she talk to you like that after everything that she's--
Flying off the handle isn't gonna help anything, Aria.
People get what they deserve.
Eventually.
That's a keeper.
If you like that series,
you should really check out some of the Swedish authors.
For some reason,
they do meatballs and crime novels better than anyone else.
I hate their meatballs.
I... I really came over to apologize.
My job, it isn't easy.
But it is especially hard when you realize
that you've turned innocent people
into collateral damage during an investigation.
What I'm trying to say is,
I hope that you and your mom are okay.
We're okay.
Good.
Here.
Get this.
You won't regret it.
Em, I just got your text.
What did your dad say?
It's what he didn't say.
"A" killed my car in the woods last week.
What's next?
We don't know that for sure. We need more proof.
Do we? Come to the brew later.
You can watch "A" Program
the cappuccino machine to melt my face off.
Emily.
No, I don't even feel safe in my own house anymore!
Look, if "A" did hack into your car,
wouldn't he own up to it by now?
The sociopathic mind feeds on intricate patterns.
Hanna, please stop reading. You're not a detective.
Every rock you turn over gets picked up and hurled at Alison.
You can pass that on to Spencer, too.
Can you please bury the hatchet with her?
I'm sick of taking sides.
No one's asked you to.
Em, I've been through this with my parents, okay?
It sucks and nobody wins.
Um, Emily, can I please just say one thing?
Okay, stop.
What're you up to?
Excuse me?
Drop the cougar-crap
and tell me why you're after a 10th grader.
What turns you on?
The fact that he shares my DNA
Or that you have full access to my bedroom?
Okay. Jesse warned me that this would happen.
Who's Jesse?
The new guidance counselor that's the best thing
that's happened to this friggin' school
since we got a coffee cart.
He sees through the bull and he has a gift
of bringing together people who need each other.
Oh, so you're gonna tell me
that Jesse made this little love-connection?
Mona, when it comes to me and my friends,
you always have an agenda.
No, you and your friends are the ones with the agenda, Aria.
After I helped Hanna's mom get out of jail,
I was burned off like a wart.
That's not exactly what happened.
Really? Then tell me. What happened?
Why was I iced out after the charges were dropped?
Why did the inner circle squeeze me out again?
Right.
Well, I'm tired of being yoyo'ed,
and I am hanging out with a different crowd now.
So suck it up, Aria.
Oh, hey, Andrew.
Ladies first.
Oh, no, it's fine. I'll come back later.
Wait up, killer.
Wanna quiz each other on the way to class?
Quiz each other for what?
You serious?
Did you space on the physics test?
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!
I'll take that as a "Yes."
Um... yeah, I'm just gonna wing it.
This isn't winging material.
I've been up all night cramming.
If you've been up all night, how come you don't look like...
me?
Sleep is overrated.
Okay.
Um... you know what? Actually, could you cover for me?
And then if you're not too busy after school,
maybe you could come by and give me your physics notes.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Mr. Fitz?
You wanted to see me?
Yes, I did.
Please come in.
And close the door.
Where's my book? Okay, it was right here.
Please tell me you didn't throw it away.
I'm on the last two pages!
Thank you.
Last two pages, huh? I'm impressed.
Oh, well, I always read the endings first.
What? Of a mystery? That's crazy.
No, it's not.
How else am I supposed to know what clues to look for?
All right, go back.
You've gotta read the middle. It's the big twist.
You're missing the best part of the book.
Well, so far, all I'm missing
is a reindeer sighting
and a canoe trip down a fjord.
What? How do you say it?
You were close.
All right, so what's the twist?
No way, uh-uh.
I'm not into giving spoilers.
Oh, come on. You owe me.
All right.
All I'll say is that it has to do with the dental records.
The ones they used to I.D. the body?
It always comes down to teeth, doesn't it?
Hi. Are you Jesse?
I am. Did we schedule an appointment?
No, I was just dropping by to--
Oh, well, let's not talk in the doorway. Please, come in.
Okay.
What's your name?
Aria Montgomery. I'm Mike's sister.
Wow. Mr. Fazelli is definitely gone.
Do you miss him?
What? Oh, no.
He was kinda old school.
His head sweat a lot.
Like a cheese.
Aria, please. Have a seat.
I was just a little curious about Mike's group.
Can anyone join or did you handpick the students yourself?
It's open to everyone.
I did reach out to certain individuals
who I know have been through some rough patches.
Why?
Well, it's just...
my little brother has, um...
he's befriended this certain individual who's bad news.
Bad news?
Yeah.
Can you be more specific?
You're referring to Mona.
Well, at least you agree.
I didn't say I agreed. But I made an educated guess.
So how can I help you?
Look, how do I say this without sounding rude?
Try.
Mona's the devil.
And I would really, really appreciate it
if you didn't encourage them being together.
Sounds like you still have some unresolved issues with Mona.
If I started, we'd be here till Friday.
Well, let's start on Tuesday.
Sounds like you could really benefit from joining our group.
Oh, no, you don't understand. This isn't about me.
Aria, it's a safe place.
It's a place where you can explore your anger.
I'm not angry!
I'm just concerned.
And this individual's history supports it.
Well, I don't discourage friendships.
If two students bond,
it's because they've found common ground.
Right.
Okay, well, thanks for hearing me out.
Any time.
Mr. Fitz?
Mr. Fields, Emily didn't tell me you were back in town.
I asked my C.O. for a little personal time.
Given all the things
that have been happening here on the home front.
Yes, well, it's been
an eventful couple of months for Emily.
Has it affected her schoolwork?
I don't think so.
I mean, senior year can be quite--
Rough, yeah, that's what she says.
Honestly, I think it's something more than that.
Staying at the Dilaurentis house, that may've been a mistake.
My wife tells me that Alison's mother, well...
she acts as if her daughter is gonna walk through the door again.
And Emily stayed and slept in her dead friend's bedroom,
and I think it took a toll on her.
Yes, well, I imagine it would.
How can I help?
Well, you seem to be one
of the few teachers she feels connected to.
I think she really trusts you.
And, well, I'm wondering if you might be able to
help get her back on track.
Well, I could give her some sort of extra-curricular project.
Something she can really throw herself into after school.
I think that might do her a world of good.
Well, I'm happy to be here for her.
I do appreciate it.
Take care.
You, too.
So one misconception is that a net force is required to
keep a body in motion,
when in fact it's needed to change
whatever current state of motion the body is in.
Did you get that?
Uh, yeah, I think I did.
Nice room. Lot of ribbons.
Jumping, dressage...
All these medals from riding?
Yeah.
I've got everything in here but the horse.
How many hours would you say you studied for this? In a row?
I don't know, like, seven.
So you're gonna need to know a lot about Newton for this.
Andrew...
I didn't ask you here to study, Andrew.
You didn't?
I've been watching you.
You have?
You're the captain of the decathlon team,
you're a starting forward, and summa cum laude.
It's time to share, Andrew.
Okay.
I'm just...I'm not interested in your notes, okay?
I want some of your study aid.
You know, the kind with the childproof cap?
I need to stay up for a while.
I don't have any of that.
Andrew, come on.
I'm your study-buddy for, like, three classes.
Plus, once I showed you my side boob.
I have a legit prescription. I can give you a few but...
I just need enough to get through the week.
I knew something was up.
What?
Since when does Spencer Hastings trust anyone's notes
but her own?
Why'd you come here then?
I don't know. I thought maybe you were done with that carpenter.
Thanks.
Dad?
Oh, my god! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Are you all right? It's okay. It's okay.
"We're at a college bar.
The Hart and Huntsman.
He likes to take me there.
But he doesn't like to call them 'dates.'"
So what do you think about my stories?
"You have a strong voice."
But...?
"But nothing.
It's only gonna get more distinctive as you grow up."
Grow up?
"You know what I mean. Mature."
So you don't think that I'm mature enough?
"I didn't say that.
I just think all great literature boils down to two themes:
love and death."
Whatever.
I don't know why I'm taking advice
from someone who doesn't know how to order.
Who eats boysenberry pie with beer?
"Don't knock it till you try it."
I should write a story about you.
Maybe I'll write one about this moment... right now.
You're lucky my mom finished her box of chardonnay.
Do you know how loud you were?
You weren't answering your phone.
Spencer, do you know what time it is?
No, I never went to bed.
It's four.
Look, who cares, okay?
I finally got a lead. It's the Hart and Huntsman.
What?
It's this pub.
It's a bar outside of Hollis college,
where Ali's mystery man took her for pie and beer.
Do you wanna come with me?
Now? I'm not wearing any underwear.
No, after fifth period.
No. No, I can't. I scheduled a cleaning at the dentist.
You're gonna pass up finding the person
who's after Ali to get your plaque scraped?
Spence, don't you get it? Ali went to the same dentist.
The police used dental records to prove that body was Alison's,
And we know it wasn't.
So someone switched the x-rays
to match whoever was in that grave.
Okay.
If I find out who was in that office
after they found the body,
we're that much closer to finding out who "A" is.
So you think that "A" went in there as a patient?
It's better than breaking in.
And I know where they keep those records.
I used to file them.
Okay.
Okay, so you go to the dentist, and I'll go to the pub.
Should we update Aria and Emily about any of this?
No, Emily will lose it
if she thinks that we're hunting down clues again.
I don't think I can make her any angrier than she already is.
Spence, this isn't forever.
Once we find out who "A" is, all will be forgiven.
Yeah.
Hey there.
Oh, hi.
Um, it's okay if I park here, right?
Well, it depends.
How long do you plan on staying?
Just as long as it takes me to mail this.
Then that's it?
Then you're out of here for good?
I think so. Why?
You know how badly Ezra wanted to see Malcolm.
So coming up here without him was a really nasty thing to do.
Aria, it's really none of your business.
Oh, really?
Well, it sure was when you asked me
not to tell Ezra that Malcolm was his kid.
If you'll excuse me...
No.
No, there is no excuse
for someone to lie about something like that
and screw up someone's life.
And if you count Malcolm, that's two people.
I didn't realize that you and Mr. Fitz were still so close.
He's lucky to have a student who's so protective of him.
Well, Mr. Fitz is too much of a gentleman
to kick you to the curb.
But somebody needs to.
I'm guessing that you've done some lying yourself
when it comes to Mr. Fitz.
Yeah, but it's not the kind that includes blackmailing his family
into paying for a three bedroom house and a fancy summer camp.
Well, that's rich, coming from a kid
who maintains her grade point average
by sleeping with her teacher.
Oh, my god. I'm sorry.
Just leave it.
You ran away?
No. I walked. Fast.
I basically just made things worse for Ezra.
She'll make sure that he never sees Malcolm ever again.
It's not like he asked you to confront her.
It happened in the moment.
It doesn't even matter. Once she tells him--
Aria, you were acting as his friend, okay?
He's not gonna be that mad.
Plus, it's not like you're still seeing him.
All right, well, if I skip his class,
will you cover for me?
Just in case he asks.
I'll try. I'll be seeing Fitz out of class, too.
My dad drafted me to co-direct the spring play with him.
What? Why?
My dad thinks I'm a basket-case.
Because you won't drive your car?
Because I tried to stab him with scissors.
Your dad? What--
I gotta go.
Sean's coming home from boarding school soon.
He made quite a splash there.
Especially with the ladies.
Looks like I missed out.
You have a loose filling in number 29.
Dr. Ackard's gonna have to take a look at that.
Today? How long is that gonna take?
Why? Are you in a rush?
No.
Tooth decay leads to heart disease, Hanna.
Didn't you learn that when you worked here?
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
Well, then I'm just gonna go back to the waiting room.
Oh, no, you're fine right here, Hon. Just sit tight.
Mr. Fitz?
Hey. Spencer, uh...
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. I just...
No, it's okay.
I just didn't expect to see you in this setting.
Have you been here before?
No. No, I never have.
That looks good. What is it?
Boysenberry.
Or actually it might be blackberry.
I don't know.
I'm going off a recommendation from the waitress.
Oh, excuse me, could I actually cancel the rest of my order?
I didn't realize how late it was
and I actually need to get going.
No problem.
Great.
Sorry to run out on you. Are you meeting someone here?
Yeah, I am.
Great. Well, it was great running into you.
Try the pie. It's pretty great.
Yeah.
Yeah, so I've heard.
Hey, it's me.
I was just wondering if Maggie had called.
Look, I didn't mean to go off on her like that.
She's probably already called her lawyer and told her
that you're involved with some violent psychotic freak.
I don't know what came over me.
I think I'm just so angry and...
just call me when you can.
Or not.
Bye.
Okay, Hanna...
Dr. Ackard, it looks like Hanna Marin couldn't wait.
So I'll call her tomorrow to schedule a follow-up.
She was the last on the books, so I'm going to head out.
I'll see you in the morning.
Thank you.
How's it going?
Hey. Good.
Been at it for a while over there, huh?
Yeah, it's a history paper, so there's a lot of reading.
I wanted to ask you,
have you given any more thought to joining our group?
Um... no.
Look, Jesse, I'm not totally clueless.
I know that there's some things that I need to work through.
I just need an outlet, like...
Roller derby?
You have a group for that, too?
No, but I got basketball.
Saturday morning pick-up games.
I'll pass.
Fair enough.
Well, I want you to know
I'm always available for a one-on-one meeting.
My door is always open.
All right.
Thank you.
I just...
I really don't want to lose my brother.
Would you like to sit down?
What? No. No, I gotta go.
Thanks.
Hey, Dr. Ackard. You know,
I think it's really great that Sean's coming back.
I feel bad that we lost touch.
I hope he's not mad at me for--
What's this?
He already paid for it, so I figured why not?
But if anyone asks, I checked your I.D.
Boysenberry pie and beer? That's what he ordered?
I know, kinda gross, right?
Yeah. Thanks.
So what do you think about my stories?
You have a very strong voice.
But...?
But nothing.
It's just going to get more distinctive as you grow up.
Grow up?
You know what I mean.
More... mature.
Oh. So you don't think that I'm mature enough?
No, I never said that.
I just think that all great literature boils down to two themes:
Love and death.
Whatever.
I don't know why I'm taking advice
from someone who doesn't know how to order.
Who eats boysenberry pie with beer?
Do not knock it until you try it.
I should write a story about you.
Maybe I'll even write one about this moment...
Right now.
Mr. Fitz?
Mr. Fitz, is that you?
Dad?
Dad, are you there?
I need you to come to the school and pick me up.
Mr. Fitz isn't here,
and I don't want to be here by myself because--
Anyway, as soon as you get this message,
please come to the school and pick me up immediately.
I'm here. I'm in the back hall.
Dad! Dad, I'm up here!
Dad! Come on!
Dad, I'm up here!
Dad, I'm up here!
I'm coming, baby!
Dad, you have to get me out!
Oh, yeah! Get me out of here!
There's somebody in here!
Come on! Dad, hurry! Come on!
There's somebody in here! He's trying to get me!
Oh, yeah!
The entrance!
I'm coming!
Okay, okay.
I got you.
We need to get out of here!
We have to go!
Hurry up!
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have panicked,
but when the lights went out--
Dad!
Dad!
Oh, my God!
Should we call mom back?
Let's wait till we get to the hospital, yeah?
Dad...
Emily, it's gonna be okay, all right?
This is all my fault.
No.
Listen, you were locked in a room. The lights went out.
I understand why you panicked.
I don't know how much more I can take of this.
Princess, I didn't tell you
because I didn't want you to worry about me.
Tell me what? What's going on?
Emily, I didn't just come home to check up on you and your mom.
I had some tests done.
I didn't want them done on the base.
What's wrong? Are you sick?
We don't have any results back yet.
It's my heart.
It's just stress. I'll get it under control.
You have something wrong with your heart?
Why-why would you keep this from me?
Because I ain't going anywhere.
Do you hear me?
You're stuck with me for the long haul, kid.
Hey, come on.
It's okay.
You should take me back.
Em, your mom's right.
You don't want to sleep in a hospital room.
Your dad's in great hands and your mom's with him.
"A" almost killed him tonight.
Yeah, but "A" couldn't have known that your dad--
You don't know that!
He almost died trying to save me! From who?
We're still not any closer to figuring out who this animal is!
What? Who is it?
It's Spencer. I texted her about your dad.
Please don't send me away.
Oh, my God.
Hanna?
Thank god.
Where have you been?
I was at the dentist,
and I think that I got treated by "A."
What? You've been at the dentist this whole time?
I thought your appointment was at 4:30.
Yeah, I know.
And I stole those appointment pages from that September--
You got them? Show them to us.
No, I don't have them.
Look, when I woke up, I was in a dentist chair,
the lights were off, and my jaw hurt.
I still feel like half of my lip is frozen.
Wait a second. You think that "A" froze you?
That "A" stuck a needle in your gums?
I don't know.
All I know is I feel like I've been
