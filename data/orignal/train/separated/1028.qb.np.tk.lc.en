are you thinking about how you &apos;d steal it ?
it weighs 2 tons and is worth maybe a couple grand . pass .
but you were thinking about it .
it &apos;s an involuntary reflex .
well , nathaniel roland &apos;s inheritance
is worth $ 40 million .
you really think one of his sons forged his will ?
people do some crazy things for money .
you think they &apos;d be that stupid ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna find out .
well , what i &apos;m gonna find out .
you &apos;re saying i &apos;m irrelevant in this case ?
the bureau requested that i authenticate the will .
i don &apos;t remember you being mentioned .
not me ?
not you .
right this way .
hi . josh roland .
you &apos;re here to authenticate my will ?
agent peter burke .
my associate neal will take a look at it .
i become relevant in a little bit .
how you doing ?
good .
may i see the wills ?
yeah , they &apos;re both here on the table .
look , i really don &apos;t want him to go to jail over this ,
but if he &apos;s trying to steal $ 40 million ...
hey , sorry , i &apos;m late .
savannah &apos;s nap went a little longer than expected .
i didn &apos;t take a nap .
shh .
why don &apos;t you go upstairs and play , okay ?
see you in a few minutes .
hi , uncle josh !
hi , sweetheart .
how you doing ? i &apos;m james .
neal .
hello .
hi .
i don &apos;t know what my brother &apos;s been telling you ,
but i haven &apos;t been doctoring up anything .
there &apos;s no way dad would have left you everything .
you &apos;d squander it .
squander it ? that &apos;s a good word .
don &apos;t you mean i &apos;d blow it ?
maybe use some of this
family &apos;s money to do some good for a change ?
dad &apos;s charitable foundation -- - tax dodges .
are they always like this ?
yeah .
you &apos;re saying that with fbi agents in the room ?
anyway , mind if we get this over with ?
yeah .
who &apos;s he ?
his name is neal . he knows a lot of stuff .
what &apos;s that thing on his leg ?
that &apos;s a tracking anklet .
i have an anklet . want to see ?
yeah . oh , cute .
where &apos;d you get it ?
my grandpa .
where &apos;d he get his ?
it &apos;s part of a federal work @-@ release program
where ...
uh ... i gave it to him .
it &apos;s so i don &apos;t lose him .
oh . are you his grandpa ?
weren &apos;t you supposed to go to your room ?
his is a forgery , right ?
this is a forgery .
what ?
i knew it .
hold on .
so is this one .
that &apos;s impossible .
they &apos;re both forged ?
yeah .
how can you say they &apos;re both fake ?
the witness signatures --
the velocity , acceleration , and pressure
both have exactly the same anomalies .
they were signed by the same person .
so , what happens now ?
before we jump to any conclusions ,
we need to verify the witness signatures .
we &apos;ll run a couple more tests . when we get something ...
... we will let you know .
thank you .
do i want to know what &apos;s in that box ?
well , to paraphrase the man who brought down the soviet union ,
it &apos;s easier to trust when you can verify .
you gonna show me a shining city on a hill ?
shining , yes , and with it ,
you can buy any city on any hill .
a treasure @-@ cam ?
look , i know how hard it must be
to see the promised land
and not be able to enter because of your leash ,
and i don &apos;t want this to come between us .
so now , we can both keep an eye on our fortune 24 / 7 .
thank you , moz .
oh . see the degas ?
think i &apos;ve lined up a buyer .
kind of had my eye on that one .
oh , well , fortunately , there &apos;s two other degas
to choose from , mister ...
did you pick a name ?
close .
glenn close ?
no , i &apos;m working on it .
might have to live with this next one till the end .
want to make sure it feels as good as &quot; neal caffrey . &quot;
a rose by any other name , neal .
choose , because , very soon ,
we &apos;re gonna be on an airplane to a different life .
we got back biometrics on roland &apos;s witness signatures .
they are definitely forged .
could &apos;ve told you that .
oh , wait . i did .
yeah , and based on your observations ,
we ran a couple other tests .
see how the &quot; a &quot; is connected to the &quot; e &quot; two letters later ?
as roland did in his youth .
roland forged the witness signatures ?
on both wills to his children .
how did i miss this ?
you didn &apos;t know he was ambidextrous .
he signed these with his left hand .
and the names are weird .
horace byth ? hatch o &apos;brey ?
it sounds like they &apos;re ripped from a salinger novel .
well , they are fictional .
what do you see ?
the same letters . they &apos;re anagrams .
tycho brahe .
tycho brahe .
15th century dutch astronomer .
16th and danish . close , though . almost impressive .
well , well . who is relevant now ?
what kind of message do you think he was trying to leave behind ?
he closes both wills with the line ,
&quot; in the end , there should
be nothing between you , which is everything . &quot;
cryptic .
wait a second .
what are you doing ?
interesting .
peter , come here .
these look like streets . a compass rose .
this isn &apos;t a message .
this is a map .
jones , tell me something .
who is that ?
easy , tiger .
she &apos;s off limits .
i already tried .
art crimes , d.c.
w @-@ what makes you think that ?
her attache case . it &apos;s from the smithsonian .
gift of choice from d.c. art crimes chief to new recruits .
what &apos;s the case ?
above my pay grade .
your boss and i go back a long way .
agent kramer &apos;s sorry he can &apos;t be here in person ,
but he briefed me fully .
he did ?
i take it he wasn &apos;t supposed to .
how much do you know ?
you discovered a german u @-@ boat
with an incredibly valuable cargo of art aboard .
the art was destroyed in a fire .
believe the fire may have been a ruse ,
and the art still exists .
you know a lot .
i &apos;m sorry . i do .
only a handful of people know about this .
i &apos;d like to keep it that way .
understood .
i don &apos;t have enough evidence to open a formal investigation .
however , part of the original german art manifest
survived the fire .
that &apos;s what i &apos;d like kramer to look into .
now , what i &apos;d like you to do is simply ...
excuse me . do you work here ?
no . i don &apos;t .
no . oh , of course you don &apos;t . i noticed your attach ?
you &apos;re , uh , d.c. art crimes , right ?
very good .
what brings you up here ?
business .
hey , do you know where i can find agent burke ?
oh , i can help you with that .
office at the top of the stairs .
thank you ...
agent matthews .
agent matthews , yes .
you &apos;re right , man . i got nothing .
told you so .
top o &apos; the mornin &apos; , neal .
apparently not .
am i late ?
right on time .
i spoke with the rolands .
you tell them about the map ?
i wanted to wait for you .
you &apos;re going to see them ?
you &apos;re a little giddy .
i love puzzles .
i know you do .
i &apos;ve seen the new york puzzlethon trophies
around the house , all three of them .
four .
oh , there &apos;s four ?
yeah .
how could i forget ?
the overlaid wills form an image .
that &apos;s the sundial in le monde garden .
we haven &apos;t done one of those in years .
one of those treasure hunts ?
yep .
told you it was a map .
i didn &apos;t say it wasn &apos;t .
well , forget it .
i &apos;ll see you in court .
he &apos;s always been high @-@ strung . you know , whatever .
why don &apos;t we take a look at the sundial ?
the real will is at the end of the hunt , right ?
yeah , maybe .
i got to go , guys . savannah &apos;s gonna be home soon .
my father &apos;s gone .
we don &apos;t have to play by his rules anymore .
what now ?
log these into evidence
and return them to the lawyers .
mm @-@ hmm , you &apos;re not even a little bit curious
about solving this puzzle ?
of course i am , but , you know , the assistant director
hasn &apos;t authorized an fbi treasure @-@ hunting unit .
well , why don &apos;t we drop by the park ?
just to make sure nothing illicit is afoot at the sundial .
i can &apos;t . i have lunch with el . but you can take a look .
you don &apos;t want to come ?
yes .
i could use your astronomical puzzling expertise .
no , i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
el had an interview this morning .
there &apos;s an opening at the dearmitt gallery .
how nice .
yeah .
next time .
just , you know ...
keep me updated .
fascinating . the complexity .
these patterns must have taken weeks to devise .
roland is like a copernican cross
between dan brown and scott turow .
i think these numbers are times of day .
4 : 30 .
that would be there .
doesn &apos;t seem to point to anything .
well , everything points to something .
did you just steal that from my brain ?
no .
we &apos;re missing some detail .
what do you think happens when the sun hits it ?
four hours to find out .
how &apos;d it go at the gallery ?
mm . good .
yeah ?
yeah , they &apos;re looking for a consultant .
so , i don &apos;t know . i was thinking ...
wow .
&quot; wow &quot; ?
no . i @-@ i was wowing your news .
i don &apos;t need to answer that .
sweetie , if it &apos;s work ...
it &apos;s nothing .
so , uh , could you -- could you consult at the gallery
and still do burke events ?
yeah , i think i could do both .
and , besides , i could do my own openings .
i don &apos;t know .
you should do this . you should do this . yeah .
i know how much you &apos;ve been wanting to get back in the art world .
i have .
honey , what does neal want ?
nothing . nothing .
he &apos;s on this ... treasure hunt .
a real treasure hunt ?
yeah . an eccentric millionaire left coded wills to his kids .
boring .
it &apos;s from neal .
it is ?
yeah .
all right , he said he &apos;s &quot; found nothing obvious in the times ,
but the sun won &apos;t shine
on the gnomon for four more hours . thoughts ? &quot;
you just happen to have the will in your back pocket ?
yeah . &quot; be prepared . &quot; eagle scout .
of course .
all right , see , there &apos;s this little flower
right next to the first time on the will .
what do you think it means ?
well , it &apos;s a tulip , which is symbolic for rebirth ...
yeah . - ... springtime , um --
that &apos;s it !
the angle of the sun is gonna be different in the spring
rather than the winter or the summer ,
so the shadow on the sundial is gonna be different .
they could re @-@ create it using a couple mirrors !
but that doesn &apos;t matter . doesn &apos;t matter .
honey .
what ?
do you want to grab some mirrors and go play with neal ?
yes !
remember when i said that things were getting
back to normal between me and peter ?
yeah , that &apos;s sweet . you know , one sentence in ,
and i already hate this conversation .
well , this morning he met with someone from d.c. art crimes .
specialty suits ? why ?
i don &apos;t know . he didn &apos;t tell me .
art crimes are your fbi raison d &apos;etre .
you are art crimes .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m letting you know .
i @-@ it could be nothing .
unh ! everything points to something .
who did he meet with ?
name &apos;s agent matthews .
she goes back to d.c. on friday .
oh , well , that gives us plenty of time .
i already lined up a buyer for the degas , and --
shh .
elizabeth , peter .
couldn &apos;t stay away , could you ?
well , not after that frantic distress text you left my wife .
neal , mozzie .
good to see you , mrs. suit .
i may have solved the sundial code .
there &apos;s a symbol for each season next to the time .
using these mirrors ,
we can re @-@ create the seasonal offset .
ooh , a sextant .
it was a birthday gift from my lovely wife --
mwah ! -- that she said i &apos;d never get a chance to use .
how did i not foresee this ?
what &apos;s the first time ?
4 : 30 .
in the spring .
yeah , but not the government @-@ forced
daylight savings 4 : 30 .
the real 4 : 30 .
hon , if you would stand -- right about here is good .
and , mr. conspiracy ,
if you could stand right about here .
and not move . good .
okay , honey , hold it a little higher and to your right .
that &apos;s it . good . swivel it towards ...
all right , honey .
that &apos;s it .
right there .
it &apos;s pointing to the letter &quot; b. &quot;
we &apos;re onto something .
what &apos;s the next letter ?
2 : 00 , and the symbol is the sun .
2 : 00 in the summer .
yeah .
mozzie ...
two steps to your left .
hold your arms up as high as you can .
is that a short joke ?
it is now .
and to your right .
honey , swivel left just a little bit more .
almost there . that &apos;s it . right there .
&quot; s. &quot;
all right , what &apos;s the next time ?
okay . mozzie , uh , two steps back .
that &apos;s -- right there . and hold the mirror lower .
and lower . lower .
lower .
swivel it , honey . that &apos;s it . right there .
and to your right .
there you go . good . lower .
right there .
&quot; h. &quot;
b.s.h.
does that mean anything to you ?
no .
three @-@ letter acronyms are your specialty , suit .
back to the drawing board ?
thanks , honey .
yeah .
yeah , jones ?
i just got off the phone with james roland .
what &apos;s going on ?
the treasure hunt just turned into a kidnapping .
someone &apos;s taken savannah .
cyber crimes and the kidnapping squad are
putting together a command center at roland &apos;s estate .
james is there with them ,
and we &apos;ve been talking to josh in the interview room .
the ransom is due in less than six hours .
how are we communicating with the kidnapper ?
website .
the domain is actually kidnappedsavannah.com ?
that takes some premeditation .
james got a call to check this u.r.l.
it &apos;s streaming a live feed ,
but it doesn &apos;t look like she &apos;s aware of the camera .
she &apos;s in good spirits .
so most likely she knows her kidnapper .
what are the demands ?
it &apos;s on the website .
a &quot; demand &quot; tab . look at that .
welcome to the 21st century .
guy &apos;s definitely tech @-@ savvy .
the site is a labyrinth of cloud data
that they can &apos;t trace beyond a firewall in the ukraine .
$ 6.4 million .
let me see james &apos; will .
that &apos;s the exact amount roland left to him in cash .
kidnapper &apos;s seen this will .
yeah .
this is personal .
almost half of all kidnappings are by a relative .
look , james and i may have our differences ,
but nobody in our family would ever do anything to hurt her .
honestly , savannah &apos;s the only reason we still even speak .
but if we find the real will ,
we can pay the ransom .
you said this is a map ?
mm @-@ hmm .
all right .
james can stay back at the house . i &apos;m gonna follow it .
uh , the truth is ,
i already took the initiative and went to the sundial .
you what ?
it gave us the letters b.s.h.
do you know what that stands for ?
yeah , that was dad &apos;s favorite acronym .
it means &quot; big sky hunting . &quot;
what does that mean ?
it meant he was taking us to the planetarium .
or , as he would put it ,
the only place to see stars in manhattan .
thay &apos;s where i &apos;m going .
no . josh .
these first few hours are critical
to figuring out who took savannah .
the best thing that you can do is to work with your brother
to help us build a suspect profile .
all right , fine , but i want to know where this leads .
will you follow this map for me ?
sure thing .
promise me .
we &apos;ll keep you posted every step of the way .
thank you .
well , this is one way to get to go on a treasure hunt .
i &apos;m not wild about james paying ransom ,
but we need him working with us to find his daughter .
i was starting to think you didn &apos;t trust
mozzie and i to go after this unsupervised .
that too .
oh . special agent burke .
mm .
ah . uh , i &apos;m felix .
well , this is the first time
a g @-@ man has come to the planetarium
on official business .
uh , you had inquired about nathaniel roland .
yes . when was the last time he was here ?
2 : 00 p.m. on december 3rd .
oh , it was a very , uh , big deal when mr. roland popped by .
usually meant someone was getting a new telescope .
huh . i know he signed in .
may i ?
thank you .
he did sign in , just not under roland .
&quot; tycho brahe . &quot;
yeah . look at that remark .
&quot; happy birthday to me &quot; ?
december 14 , 1546 .
uh , tycho brahe .
that &apos;s his birthday .
felix , would you mind firing up the projector ?
it &apos;s time to go big sky hunting .
this is our sky today .
now let me bring you back to tycho &apos;s birthday .
and here we are in 1592 .
we know the time and date to look at the stars .
now we just need to figure out where in the sky .
in his will , roland talks about big sky hunting
with his favorite twins .
josh and james aren &apos;t twins .
no . they &apos;re a year apart .
maybe he was talking about the twins in the sky .
felix , where are the gemini twins ?
i only see one brother .
well , they &apos;re split on the horizon --
one above , one below .
tycho had a twin who died shortly after he was born .
interestingly , brahe wrote a letter to his deceased twin
in his first published work .
that &apos;s got to be it .
do you know what was in the letter ?
no .
uh , but i can show it to you .
we have the first printed copy of brahe &apos;s collected works .
it &apos;s on display in the north gallery .
let me guess --
a generous donation from ... nathaniel roland ?
precisely .
tycho brahe &apos;s original notes on &quot; de nova stella . &quot;
the letter he wrote to his brother is on page 273 .
would you mind turning to that page ?
well , that would be impossible .
mr. roland left the book
with very specific instruction .
of course he did .
&quot; the mechanical arm turns one page every hour
&quot; until it reaches the end .
then the process reverses . &quot;
this is half @-@ inch glass .
pressure , temperature , and humidity are controlled
to preserve the paper .
it cannot be tampered with in any way .
listen to me , felix .
this book may have implications in a kidnapping .
oh , i &apos;m sorry to hear that , but ...
but you don &apos;t understand .
i wish i could help you , but my hands are tied .
you could come back in a few days .
right . okay . thanks , diana .
what &apos;s going on ?
she &apos;s got a solid lead .
i &apos;m meeting her back at the bureau .
what about the book ?
we told james we &apos;d see this through .
i said i &apos;m meeting her back at the fbi , not you .
are you saying you trust me enough
to continue without you ?
neal , we got to get savannah back .
with that , i trust you completely .
we just need to flip a few pages of a book .
that sounds simple enough . seems completely possible .
yet if i &apos;m reading this correctly ...
it &apos;s completely impossible .
this is a centuries @-@ old book ,
written to a man &apos;s dead twin brother ,
donated by an equally eccentric ,
电影导演 慈善家 以及当时世界上最富有的人之一
recently deceased modern @-@ day howard hughes ,
as part of a posthumous treasure hunt .
there &apos;s nothing simple about this one .
how about ... a cannonball ?
no . that &apos;s too many people .
this place is nearly empty during the day .
they only have two employees .
we could do the lazy susan .
i like what you &apos;re thinking ,
but i don &apos;t want the sprinkler system running ,
not when we might have to expose the manuscript .
this uses an eagle @-@ one alarm system .
so does the rest of the planetarium .
that means there &apos;s a single access code
for every keypad in the whole place .
blind man &apos;s bluff .
that could work .
we &apos;re gonna need a dog .
satchmo , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ve got the door .
you just stay right there .
mozzie . neal . um ...
what are you guys doing here ?
is satchmo free this afternoon ?
we &apos;ve zeroed in on a man named brett gelles .
he comes by every year to update roland &apos;s security system .
tech @-@ savvy , has a relationship with savannah .
tells her he &apos;s the guy who keeps her safe .
we did a financial work @-@ up .
his business is all dried up .
serious credit problems .
have we located him ?
he &apos;s not at home .
we have a team searching his place now .
no sign of anything .
that &apos;s not his home .
he doesn &apos;t have an office .
where is he keeping her ?
somewhere she feels comfortable .
and he feels secure enough to leave her alone .
what about a hotel ?
no . too conspicuous .
get me a list of all the places he &apos;s done security on .
ah , you think he &apos;s camping out at one of his clients &apos; homes .
find out if any of them are out of town .
you &apos;re on .
ladies and gentlemen , unfortunately ,
the tycho brahe exhibit &apos;s
gonna be closed for the rest of the afternoon .
we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you .
uh , if you &apos;d like , our next screening of &quot; across the galaxy &quot;
starts in our theater in five minutes .
you don &apos;t want to miss it . thank you so much .
i like the idea of stars .
go , satchmo . go .
help ! i @-@ i @-@ i lost my guide dog !
help--
uh , he &apos;s in my office .
has anyone seen -- i lost my dog .
sir , he &apos;s in my office .
who are you ?
i &apos;m felix , the docent .
i &apos;m so sorry , felix .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gotten into him .
these things happen .
yes , they certainly do .
it &apos;s right here .
come in .
all right .
what do we have ?
we have gelles having installed 22 home @-@ security systems .
four of those homeowners are on vacation .
should we move in on them ?
very carefully .
send a team to sit on these places .
look , he &apos;s not hurting her ,
so i don &apos;t wanna force this into a hostage situation .
but let me know if there &apos;s so much as a flicker inside .
satchmo , go sit .
sit . good boy .
so , d.c. art crimes -- any new info ?
that rookie agent &apos;s in town till tomorrow .
she doesn &apos;t know who i am .
the old traveling salesman .
yeah . good idea .
all right . how &apos;re we looking up there ?
you missed it .
we need page 273 .
yeah . i know . it &apos;s the first time it skipped .
can you make it reverse ?
hold on .
okay , seriously ?
what , you want to come down and give it a go , bob vila ?
bring it .
oh , good news .
what ?
uh , i &apos;m gonna fence the degas tonight .
yeah . that &apos;s great news , moz .
but can we handle the book , please ? we don &apos;t have time .
yeah . we need to cut a hole .
just big enough for the pointer to turn the page .
and we can seal it with a polymer filament .
please tell me you brought a polymer filament .
my favorite brand .
are you ready ?
yep .
if this doesn &apos;t work , we blame the dog .
bad dog !
neal , somehow you managed to make my dog
an accomplice to robbery .
elizabeth said i &apos;d bear the brunt of this .
you know , i give you an inch , and --
now it &apos;s light reading .
too soon .
the planetarium intends to prosecute .
this book is a forgery .
brahe lived on an island .
he ran his own paper mill , primarily from tulip @-@ tree stock ,
which has a very low acetic content .
look , the real manuscript could be left
in a turkish bathhouse without risk of harm .
the one from the planetarium
turned into a shrinky dink the second it hit the air .
so roland intended for you to destroy this book .
yes .
what ?
these symbols .
i &apos;ve seen them before -- on savannah &apos;s anklet ...
which was given to her by her grandfather .
so savannah &apos;s the next clue . mm @-@ hmm .
is it too soon to say &quot; i told you so &quot; ?
yes .
all right .
con ed is reporting an increase in power usage
at the home on 68th .
okay . i &apos;m going to 68th .
diana , i want you to run point here .
jones , you stay with james and josh at command center .
gelles has to make contact soon so we can set up the drop .
if he &apos;s in the house with her , this could get ugly .
what if i could lure him out of the house ?
how ?
tell him james doesn &apos;t have the money .
it &apos;s all tied up in the treasure hunt .
the only way he gets his ransom
is to give us savannah &apos;s anklet .
give me two minutes on the phone with him .
okay . let &apos;s do it .
all right .
hello ?
put james on .
no .
damn it . i said no cops .
i am the farthest thing from a cop that you can imagine .
i &apos;m james roland &apos;s in @-@ house council .
i &apos;m here to ensure that everyone gets what they want .
i &apos;m listening .
savannah was wearing an ankle bracelet .
it &apos;s the key to unlocking mr. roland &apos;s fortune .
what are you talking about ?
well , mr. roland left behind a rather unorthodox will .
it &apos;s a game , and now we all have to play along .
i &apos;m not bringing savannah to you .
then just the bracelet .
what , y @-@ you think i &apos;m an idiot ?
come on , brett .
we know who you are .
and we know from your video feed
that you don &apos;t want to hurt savannah .
the brothers just want to settle this quickly and quietly .
you know how eccentric roland was .
bring us her anklet , and you &apos;ll get your money .
he hung up ? what does that mean ?
we caught him off guard , all right ?
he just needs to formulate a new plan .
the clock just went to zero .
ohh ! damn it !
peter , did you hear the call ?
copy . no movement at target one .
team three ?
peter , he may not be at any of these locations .
con ed got back to us . the power blip before
was caused by the air @-@ conditioning unit .
nobody &apos;s in that home .
you &apos;re definitely in the wrong place .
okay . i want you to recheck every inch of gelles &apos; home .
i want phone records , receipts , anything that tells us
where he &apos;s been in the last couple months .
copy that .
where are you , gelles ?
gelles ?
you know who i am . what &apos;s the point in hiding ?
easy ! easy ! easy .
daddy , where are you ?
uncle josh ?
help me !
see ?
now , anything happens to me ,
anybody follows me when i leave ,
and you can all sit around and watch her die .
i &apos;m the only one that knows where she is ,
and i &apos;m not telling till i get my money .
fbi agents -- out . now .

let &apos;s clear out .

i stay .
guy on the phone .
i am .
here .
find my money .
all right , we can do this .
just like one of dad &apos;s stupid scavenger hunts
when we were 10 .
between the sun and moon , there -- there &apos;s a bicycle ,
a tennis racket , and a camera .
does that mean anything to you ?
christmas when i was 10 .
yeah . you got a bike .
and you got a tennis racket .
who got the camera ?
nobody .
no . dad did , and he took a picture of the three of us .
where is it ?
probably somewhere in the house .
find it .
you all packed up and ready to go ?
i &apos;ll leave when i &apos;m ready .
you can &apos;t touch me .
oh , yeah , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve got it all under control .
what could possibly go wrong ?
the old man forged the wills .
we have no idea where the real ones are
or how much he even left these guys .
oh . come on . he left them plenty .
i knew him .
then how could you do this to his family ?
i came to him a year ago .
i told him , &quot; i have money problems ...
and i need help . &quot;
and you know what he said to me ?
he said ...
&quot; make a plan . see it through . &quot;
&quot; make a plan . see it through . &quot;
advice taken .
the crime isn &apos;t the hard part .
hard part &apos;s getting away with it .
you see , you never know
how an investigation is gonna go ...
or what little clues you might accidentally leave behind .
i hope you &apos;ve learned to sleep with one eye open .
bingo !

savannah , do you hear us ?
they &apos;re in the same place exactly opposite each other .
what was the last line of the will ? it &apos;s the same in both .
something like , &quot; when it &apos;s all said and done ,
there shouldn &apos;t be anything between you . &quot;
&quot; in the end , there should be nothing between you . &quot;
&quot; which is everything . &quot;

well , i &apos;ll have to ask felix
if they &apos;ve removed you from their no @-@ fly list .
after their father &apos;s endowment in the will ,
i &apos;ll bet even satchmo &apos;s allowed to return .

yes , i did , thanks to you .
i never introduced myself , by the way . i &apos;m sorry .
chris gates . oh .
hello , chris .
how you doing ?

you &apos;re interpol ?
yeah . yeah .
what division ?
art crimes .
to a kindred spirit .
you have that look on your face .
what look ?
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re in new york for the same reason i am .
which is ?
classified .
we &apos;ve said too much , okay ?
i &apos;m sure agent burke said the same thing to you he said to me .
so let &apos;s just -- let &apos;s talk about the weather .
let &apos;s talk about something innocuous .
how about we both say , on three ?
what ?
no . no .
at the same time ?
all right .
okay .
1 , 2 , 3 ...
1 , 2 , 3 ...
nazi s ...
oh . not cool .
you &apos;re tricky .
what ?
it &apos;s incredible , though , isn &apos;t it ?
what , that agent burke thinks all this art
is just floating around out there or ...
can you imagine if it is ?
oh , god , i wish that i had clearance to see that manifest .
yeah , well , you can stop fishing here .
i mean , he didn &apos;t -- he didn &apos;t show it to me , either , so ...
any theories ?
um , apparently ...
they only found one page , so ...
so it &apos;s a partial list .
most of what was on the sub is still unaccounted for .
right .
but if anyone tries to sell anything that &apos;s on that list ...
we &apos;re gonna hear about it .
and we &apos;re gonna nail &apos; em .
yes !
yes , we are .
bam .
will you excuse me for a minute ? i &apos;ll be right back .
mozzie . where are you ?
you cannot -- i repeat -- you cannot sell the piece .
