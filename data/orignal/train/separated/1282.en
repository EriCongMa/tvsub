Okay! Harder! Harder! Don't stop!
Don't ever stop! Keep going!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
This ain't some fancy workout, girls, and it sure ain't yoga.
My workout will get you in shape.
You'll become a fighting machine.
You work out with me, and I'l turn you into one tough broad.
We're doing it all here. Come on. Work out.
See her form?
See what she's doing? Yes! Yes!
You are one tough broad!
Enough already.
You're only gonna be gone for three days.
You're pregnant. You're vitamin-ing for two.
Do we need to revisit
the pictures of the iron-deficient spleen?
I'm so excited for your medical examiner's convention.
Is there anything I can do that will help you get out the door?
Take your pyridoxine.
Is it the one that looks like Fred Flintstone
or Barney Rubble?
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, too.
But I'm excited I'm gonna get to spend some
one-on-one time with Jane.
So, there will be a temporary fill-in M.E.
And Susie will be available at the crime lab.
And, of course, I'm always available by phone.
Day or night.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Yeah, but, I mean, I don't know.
What if something goes wrong with the house?
Or we have another big case?
Maybe I should just stay.
I thought you were really looking forward to this.
I was.
But...?
Graywoods casino.
Food by Wolfgang Puck. Oh.
Table magic by David Blaine. What?
Sounds incredibly awesome.
I know. Way better than my convention.
What? The one you hosted? It was a big hit.
Yeah, but it just wasn't...Fun.
Well, medical-examiner conventions aren't supposed to be fun.
That's not the point. They're supposed to be educational.
Andrea Bocelli.
Double hubba-hubba.
I'm marrying you off before Maura gets back.
Good luck.
Rizzoli.
Isles. Yes. I'll be right out.
Okay. I'm on my way.
Cab.
Homicide.
Maybe I should stay.
Go to the convention. Save a life.
Okay, we're walking. We're moving. We're going.
See. You're having fun already.
Sergeant Korsak.
Morning, Jenkins.
Guy just left this for you. Bobby Symanski.
Korsak.
I'll be right there.
The temp M.E. is on his way.
Deceased is Judith Barnett, 40.
Multiple stab wounds on her back.
Weapon?
Two round blood smears on either side of her,
so the killer was kneeling over her.
No sign of forced entry.
Neighbor saw a white truck gunning away from the curb.
License plate?
No.
And no description of the driver.
Neighbor saw the open door,
came in, found the body, called 911.
What about relatives?
The victim's husband, Alan, is a dentist.
He's been with a patient, in surgery.
Here's the address.
All right.
Let us know what you turn up.
We'll go talk to Alan.
Dr. Barnett should be finished any moment.
Are you sure I can't help you, detectives?
Uh, no, thank you.
We really do need to speak to Dr. Barnett.
Here you go, sweetie. Thanks.
See you tomorrow.
Oh, here he is.
You have someone coming to pick you up, right?
My son -- Sam.
Excellent.
Very good driver, sam.
I'm sure.
Good to see you, Marion.
Dr. Barnett.
These detectives from the Boston Police
would like to speak with you.
Oh. Really? Why?
What time did you leave the house this morning?
6:15. Judith was asleep.
I met Mrs. Gold here at 6:30.
And your receptionist can confirm that?
What?
No. She comes in at 8:00.
I was alone with Mrs. Gold for the gum graft.
She needs extra attention.
I told Jjudith that something like this might happen.
What do you mean?
Judith was big all her life --
As a girl, when I met her, when we got married.
And I loved her. Just the way she was.
But she didn't love herself. She tried dieting. Never worked.
Then, a year ago, she found tough broad.
The workout.
She lost a hundred pounds.
And I was really worried for her.
Could explain that for us?
She was a grown woman who'd never learned
how to deal with men's advances
because no one was ever interested.
Most woman develop some kind of defenses as teenagers.
Judith was getting a lot of attention from men.
She didn't know how to handle it.
Excuse me.
Frankie.
Was there a specific man giving your wife attention?
No, but...
Guys were starting conversations with her in the supermarket.
Waiters were fawning over her.
The mailman hung around to chat.
Okay. Thanks.
Did that bother you?
Me? No.
I was proud.
I was the guy with this amazing wife.
Was Judith expecting anyone at your house this morning?
Our handyman.
He's been putting in new insulation.
And what is his name?
Luis Benitez.
We'll be in touch, Dr. Barnett.
We are very sorry for your loss.
What's up?
That call from frankie.
They found the knife used to stab Judith.
It's got the initials "L.B." carved into the handle.
Let's have some uniforms bring Luis Benitez in for a chat.
Let's.
He's got a long rap sheet.
Multiple arrests for breaking and entering.
Multiple incidents of assault with a deadly weapon.
Wild guess on the weapon -- a knife.
Wild and correct.
Korsak.
He did so much work for the Barnetts,
They set up an account for him at factory Hill Hardware.
He bought locks a month ago.
So he'd have a key.
Could this get any easier?
When the uniforms went to pick up Luis, he was gone.
His mother said he went out of town --
Took some clothes, left in a hurry.
So our guy's not ready to jump into cuffs just yet.
What's up, Chang?
Jane!
Uh, Dr. Crosby gave me
the initial findings from the crime scene.
Well, why didn't he give them to me?
Oh, there's a reason why he works in a one-man office in Maine.
Anyhoo...
These are Judith's wounds.
The length and the shape of the knife found at the scene
match the wound pattern.
The edges were serrated,
which is why ribs were broken and bone was sawed off.
What about the blood on the knife?
Matches the victim.
No fibers or hair on the body that weren't hers.
So you think the killer snuck up behind her and stabbed her?
I can't say.
Well, take a guess.
I'm a scientist.
So's Maura. She does it.
I'm not Dr. Isles.
I know that, but she's not here.
So, throw out a theory.
Stretch your wings and grow.
It's your time to shine. Whoo!
That's a mixed metaphor.
Okay, see. There you go. That's very Maura.
Nope. Okay.
*Everything is different, though*
*And nothing has changed*
*Walking these streets, I still feel strange*
*If you want to see the things I see*
*Come on and take a little walk with me*
Vince?
*Come on and take a little walk with me*
Vince?
*Turn a corner, you're caught off guard*
*You thought you were tough*
Oh, hey, Angela.
Hi.
*You thought you were hard*
Who's that?
Bobby Symanski, my friend Peter's grandson.
He's good.
Very.
I like that song.
His grandfather wrote it. We used to have a band.
Wow. He must be proud.
*Come on and take a little walk*
He's dead.
I'm sorry.
Oh, it's a long time ago.
Bobby dropped this off.
He's playing in Boston.
That's great. You gonna go see him?
He wants me to play with him.
Vince, even better!
I don't play those songs anymore. It's not who I am.
You know, in one lifetime, we lead a lot of different lives.
Well, that one's over.
If... you want it to be.
Tell Jane I was looking for her.
Sure thing.
Luis was an almost constant presence
at the house the last year.
So he witnessed Judith's total transformation.
Hi!
Hold on.
No more shots for Carla.
I'm not driving!
More shots for carla!
Continue.
Well, they spent a lot of time together.
Uh, maybe that allowed Luis to think
there was something more going on than her just being nice.
What is going on in your room?
I've turned it into a hospitality suite with an open bar.
Ah! Good job, Gary!
He hit the bull's-eye. Great.
Well, it looks like you're having fun.
Jane, it's a nightmare.
Carla is out of control, and they've wrecked my room.
And now they think I'm this crazy party person.
You're not?
Look, don't do anything that makes you uncomfortable, all right?
Just be yourself.
Right. Absolutely. Good advice.
Dr. Isles! We're dry over here!
Well, give me that bottle of rye,
and I'll show you how to make a Dr. Pecker!
Hey, Frankie.
Uniforms spotted Luis' car in the South End.
Okay. Where are you?
In an alleyway near the corner of Mass and Columbus.
There he is, Jane. I got to go.
He's coming out the back.
Move. Move!
Freeze! Boston police!
Put your hands on the car.
Get your hands on the car!
Didn't you learn anything the last time you got arrested, Luis?
Don't run.
Makes you look guilty.
Tell us what happened yesterday morning.
I showed up for work at the Barnetts'.
I knocked on the door.
No one answered. So I used my key.
I walked around, and I found Mrs. Barnett.
But I didn't do it.
Then why did you run?
Because I've got a record. Because I know how it looks.
'Cause no one believes an ex-con.
Do you have your initials on all your tools?
No, just my knife.
To remind me that what's used for evil
can also be used for good.
And where is that knife now?
I don't know. I can't find it.
You've got multiple priors for robbery,
breaking and entering, three separate stabbings.
All that time in the house with Judith.
You must have thought that could go somewhere.
So you made a move on her.
And when she refused, you got mad.
That could have happened.
It did happen.
No. But it could have.
I had no self-control.
When I got out of prison the last time,
even moms told me she wasn't gonna be there for me,
that I had shamed her, that I...
that I had shamed god.
And I heard her.
I went back to our church. I went to A.A.
Moms gave me my room back,
and I moved in so she could see I was trying.
And I changed.
Well, Judith was changing, too.
That must have been attractive to you.
Yes.
Yes, it was.
I-I...
she became a different person.
S-s-she...
it gave me hope.
I told her so.
She inspired me.
Padre nuestro, que estas en el ciel.
What does your gut tell you?
We need evidence.
He knew the victim. He was in her house.
The murder weapon belonged to him.
What about motive?
I can think of 10.
Me, too, but none of them feel right.
We've got no witnesses
and nothing but the knife to tie him to the murder.
What do you want to do?
Give me five minutes.
Susie!
I was, uh, just coming to talk to you.
Oh, I'm not there. I'm here. To show you how I shine.
Okay. Great.
What's that?
It's my theory.
Your theory's in a box?
It's a "Die-o-rama."
Oh. D-I-E.
Yes.
... for dead people.
Well, not all of them are dead,
but it's a representation of how they got to be.
It's amazing.
Yes.
And the killer is wearing a tyvek suit.
Yes.
Because there was no forensic evidence
found at the crime scene,
Which means the killer was wearing
some sort of protective outerwear.
The handyman had tyvek suits in his truck.
Yes.
You made all this just to tell me that?
No, I made this to figure it out.
I'm a visual thinker.
Well... it's fantastic.
Really. Susie, thank you. We got him.
Except the handyman didn't do it.
Okay, but you said --
The handyman's too tall to make the stab wounds
at the angle of entry they were made on Judith's body.
See, this killer is to scale,
but your suspect would not be to scale.
But the Tyvek suit --
He uses them a lot. Maybe someone knew that.
You just guessed.
I theorized.
You guessed. No, no. You guessed.
That was a guess. That was...
You don't use these things to illustrate stuff
in your personal life, right?
Uh... okay.
Luis, you spent a lot of time at the barnett house.
Did you ever see anything unusual?
Mostly Mrs. Barnett was alone.
The only person that came by was the tough broad guy.
Mickey Rizzo.
Yeah, the boxer.
He was over all the time -- private coaching.
They always closed the door.
We talked to Luis Benitez's parole officer,
his A.A. sponsor, his mother,
his bible-studies group.
They all tell the same story -- he's a changed man.
The knife wounds are precise and deliberate.
Not what you'd expect from an ex-con with anger issues.
And Susie says he's not to scale.
What?
We'll talk about Susie when you get back. Hey.
I think it's time we go meet the man
who turned Judith into a tough broad.
I've got another lead to pursue.
Take Frankie.
Sure. You okay?
Great.
Did you get a chance to go over those case files I sent you?
Jane, you shouldnt have sent these.
It's a serious violation of protocol.
This is Dr. Crosby's case.
He's the only one authorizd to release these files.
Well, I didn't want to bother him. He was too busy going slow.
Well, this makes me very uncomfortabl.
Just take a look, please. See if you see anything.
Come on, Maura! We're playing "Autopsy jeopardy!"
Well, I see you've turned it back into your kind of convention.
Oh, yeah. Last night was a bit much.
Carla threw my toilet seat out the window.
One game, and then we're watching my slide show.
Oh, no, don't do that to the --
Hey, Vince!
This thing is huge!
If Maura ever kicks me out, I'm gonna move right in.
What's that?
My old guitar,
from when I played with Bobby's grandfather.
I'm gonna give it to Bobby.
That's nice. It's not what he wants.
Yeah, but it's family history.
History is for old people.
Well, what do you think he wants?
Come on, Vince.
You're smarter than that. Think about it.
Bye!
Bye-bye.
How well do you know Judith Barnett?
Very well. She joined the gym a year ago.
Hey, what she did with her body
took a lot of work and a lot of time.
You gave her a lot of personal attention,
make her feel special.
I mean, yeah. That's a big part of my job.
Really? - Look, these women --
they don't get a lot of attention from their husbands.
They come here to feel better about themselves.
And if part of that's me flirting with them,
well, hey, that's good for business.
You ever go to her house?
I set up her gym.
Are we gonna find your DNA in her bedroom?
Why are you asking about DNA?
Were you having an affair with Judith Barnett?
No. Look. You know what? Judy was a client.
Where were you yesterday morning between 7:00 and 9:00?
Asleep.
Alone?
You know what?
I'm not gonna answer any more questions, all right?
Okay.
We're gonna need a list of your clients and your investors.
And we'll let them answer the questions.
Hey, you know what? I'm the pride of east Boston, all right?
I'm golden gloves in two weight classes.
That's great, but it does--
Hey, you know, it's taken me years
to build this business and gain these women's trust.
You were alone when she was murdered.
That doesn't help you.
You see how this looks, Mickey?
All right, look. I wasn't alone.
What's her name?
This could ruin me.
Prison will ruin you.
Look, you got it all wrong. It's not like that.
I mean, these women here, they're all great, but...
I'm gay.
It would kill my business if it got out.
All right. All right. It won't get out.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Look, Judy wasn't doing anything with anyone.
She spent all her time working out.
But this dentist, he just...
I don't know. He lost interest in her.
Did she talk to her husband about this?
For sure, she did.
She invited him to come down here,
see what this place was all about, but he never came.
You know, she thought they'd work out together
once they got the gym in the house, but he never did.
All he did was go to his old cabin every weekend
and leave a beautiful woman at home, alone.
Thanks, Mickey.
We'll let you know if we need anything else.
Well, he was doing something.
Or someone.
It's not exactly something a married man
leaves out in the open when he's cheating.
One toothbrush, a can of shaving cream,
A single disposable razor.
No sign of another person being here, let alone a woman.
Yeah, same thing here --
a couple of single-serve frozen dinners from the trash,
Water bottles.
He wasn't here to fish, either.
No poles, no tackle, no boat.
Well, so what?
He comes up here to get away from it all
and practice his dentistry skills?
Something you should see outside.
Is Alan opening a fruit stand?
It's not a great location.
Better be some interesting garbage.
I think it's a bullet hole.
I think Alan used these for target practice.
So what? The victim was stabbed.
I know it doesn't make any sense, but...
No. You're right. It's crazy.
Alan's amazing wife is waiting at home
and he's out here in woodlandia,
playing with his dental tools and shooting at watermelons?
Why? There's got to be more to it.
Let's get all this back to the crime lab,
have Susie take a look at it.
Yep.
Did you find anything yet? What's that?
It's not watermelon, but it came from inside of one.
The broken watermelons all have it.
Well, can you take your best guess? Chalk?
I shouldn't. I can't.
Jane, Susie has been trained not to guess.
Really?
Well, can she tell me what made these holes?
Circumferentially, they're the same dimension as a .22-caliber bullet.
Jane, it took you one whole day
to corrupt senior criminalist Chang.
I'm so sorry, Dr. Isles.
Detective Rizzoli means well,
but you cannot let her impatience
influence your methodology.
You forgot to activate the cone of silence.
Well, can we at least talk about...
whatever it is you two are doing here?
Susie's pursuing an interesting line of inquiry,
a forensic examination of the victims.
"Victims"? What -- what victims?
Those aren't victims. Those are watermelons.
I am conducting a "fruit-opsy."
That's funny.
Hilarious. I'll check in later.
I'm going to go get a sus-ictionary.
There you go.
Hey, Vince.
Hey, Angela.
Well, you can keep it from me, Vince,
but you can't keep it from yourself.
It's a lot more complicated
than the loss of an old friend, Angela.
Complications. Secrets. Pain. Happiness.
They're all the spices in the soup.
You leave one out, it doesn't taste as good.
Peter & Vince.
We had a meeting with an A&R record guy from New York.
He took us out on the town. He wined us. He dined us.
At the end of the night, Peter wanted to go home.
He wanted to see his wife and kid.
But not me. I was flying.
I didn't want that night to end.
I let him walk home alone, drunk.
He took a shortcut across some railroad tracks.
He fell. He hit his head.
Never woke up.
It snowed that night.
Took a couple of days to find his body.
So...How do I tell Bobby I killed his grandfather?
Oh, come on, Vince. You know that's not true.
Well, I should have --
No, this is not about you, my friend.
This is about Bobby.
It's about what he wants, what only you can give him.
What the hell could I possibly give Bobby?
How about a little piece of his grandfather?
Because he's still alive here in your heart.
Detective Rizzoli, I have the lab report.
And another box.
It's my findings from the fruit-opsy.
They're a little hard to explain,
so I did the only logical thing.
You made another die-o-rama.
To scale.
Okay, well, Frankie said that he thought the watermelons
were being used for target practice.
I agree.
The bullet traveled through and through this one.
The projectile struck the back wall of the watermelon
and tore out a chunk.
But in that watermelon, the bullet didn't come out.
There were no bullets in the watermelons.
Could you have missed them?
Oh, no, the external examination of the subjects
showed no other means of exit.
And the x-rays were negative for any foreign bodies within.
E-except...
Except what?
Nothing.
Maura's not here.
That stuff I found was dental plaster.
It's made from gypsum.
And it was different in each watermelon.
Almost as if they came from different batches.
He was trying to make a bullet
that couldn't be detected in an autopsy.
He was?
Well, of course he was, Susie.
Everyone knows the die-o-rama doesn't lie.
I'll be careful.
Oh, no! Aah!
I should have wrote "Handle with care" on that one.
Alan was trying to make a bullet out of dental plaster,
Something that would break apart once it entered Judith's body.
Is that even possible?
Air marshals use bullets that won't pass through a body
and hurt an innocent passenger
or damage the structure of the plane.
Is that Susie's die-o-rama?
It's very realistic. And to scale, and the detail...
Focus, Maura.
Well, I just think that detailed work deserves appreciation.
Okay.
The plaster bullet that did this
was too hard.
It went all the way through, and it didn't break apart.
So he mixed and remixed the plaster.
That would explain all the broken-up watermelons
in the compost bin.
That's right.
Until he found the perfect formula.
Maximum damage with no exit wound.
And there'd be no ballistics.
I'd like to remind everyone, again,
that Judith Barnett was stabbed to death.
I'm not so sure of that.
I mean, there's something about the nature of the knife wounds
that's been bothering me.
Frankie, can you pull up the x-rays?
See, this wound is narrow
and it's not as deep as the surrounding damage.
Is that a fragment from the dental plaster?
No, according to the autopsy report,
it's a bone fragment that penetrated the pericardium.
It broke off.
That's what happens when you are stabbed.
Yes, she was stabbed.
But the wound track here is too narrow.
That bone fragment was not driven into the wound by the knife.
Jane, I'd like Susie to examine
the bone fragments from the wounds.
Okay, and I want her to test
Judith's clothes for gunshot residue.
Why would he shoot her first and then stab her?
Because if Alan snuck up on this woman with a knife
and she caught him, she'd kick his ass.
If Alan wanted to make a dental-plaster bullet,
he'd need two things --
He'd need a gun and something to make a cartridge.
Well, the holes in the watermelons
were the size of a .22-caliber.
I borrowed some from ballistics.
He'd need to pull out the lead bullet from the casing
and then replace it with the one he made.
He spent a lot of time pulling teeth with these things.
I believe he could take... a bullet out of a cartridge.
Well, that was easy enough.
No gun license in Massachusetts
or anywhere else for Alan Barnett.
None for Judith, either.
So, how the hell did he get a gun?
I don't see Alan Barnett going out and making a street buy.
He didn't have to.
This is a crime-scene photo of the cabin.
I had that part blown up.
Young Alan Barnett had a Ruger Bearcat, .22 caliber.
Good little squirrel gun.
I know Dr. Crosby says death by stabbing.
He's not Maura.
What have you got?
Hi, Detective Rizzoli.
I was just about to give my results to Dr. Isles.
Well, you have done a wonderful job
of not guessing and preserving your scientific mythology.
Thank you.
It's methodology, Jane.
I say tomato, you say "Tomaht-ology"
What have we got? GSR on the clothes?
Susie, would you describe for us
what you're seeing in the microscope?
Yes, of course, Dr. Isles.
There are no bone-growing cells
or proteins present in these bone fragments.
These bone fragments are from cadaver bone,
not your victim's ribs.
The bone fragments have to be part of the bullet
that Alan made.
It's brilliant, really.
I mean, all he had to do was add pieces of cadaver bone
to the dental plaster before it hardened.
He created the perfect delivery system.
And the knife wounds were meant to splinter the ribs
to hide the cadaver bone in the wound tracks.
And to set up the handyman.
Alan used Luis' knife. He knew he had a record.
It's a great plan, actually.
Except for the one part that doesn't make sense.
Why would a happily married man kill his wife
after she lost a hundred pounds?
'Cause he liked her just the way she was.
When he was the only man who paid her any attention.
Thanks.
Trace evidence section found gunshot residue
on Judith Barnett's crop top.
Jane, this changes everything.
Now I need to notify Dr. Crosby of my findings.
Although the stab wounds are significant injuries,
given what I know now,
I'm revising my initial cause of death to gunshot wound.
It's time we had a talk with Alan Barnett.
Thank you for coming in.
I know you must be very busy with your wife's arrangements.
Detective Rizzoli and I are very sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
It has been very hard on me.
She was my friend, my partner, my lover.
She was everything to me.
You two must have had a great life together --
travel, restaurants, weekends at the cabin.
Did you go fishing up there? Hiking?
No. Not much.
No.
No, you wouldn't have.
No, you'd rather watch hiking on your tv.
in your big, soft chair, with Judith right next to you.
That's what we enjoyed.
Yeah, but she stopped enjoying it, didn't she?
Then she joined tough broad, got in shape, lost the weight,
and good-looking men started paying attention to her.
Big, strong men.
Men like Luis and Mickey.
Of course.
She looked great.
And that made you happy.
It made her happy.
That's what we want for our loved ones.
What a generous little man you are.
Well, considering that your wife
started a new life that you were no longer a part of.
My wife loved me.
She would never leave me.
You were watching tv alone.
Going to the cabin alone.
You two no longer had anything in common
because she'd already left.
No! I would never have allowed...
Am I being placed under arrest?
You're free to go, Dr. Barnett.
Of course I am.
Because you have a theory but no evidence.
I'm not much of a fisherman. Neither are you.
You've got nothing.
And that's all you'll ever have.
He thinks he's smarter than us.
Maybe he is.
Bullshit.
Where's Frankie?
We're meeting him in break. You got something?
Yeah.
I had Susie take a blood sample from the patient that alan was with
the morning of his wife's murder.
Ketamine? The animal tranquilizer?
According to Maura, dentists use it.
But an elderly patient like Mrs. Gold
should be administered a very low dose.
She had a detectable level of ketamine still in her system.
48 hours after her surgery.
Mrs. Gold was really out of it when we saw her.
Yeah, he knocked her out
and gave himself the perfect window of opportunity.
Strike one.
I found the best route from Alan's office to his house.
No traffic cameras, no homeland security cameras.
15 minutes each way.
Okay.
So, the handyman was scheduled to arrive at Alan's house
while he was performing the gum graft.
But Judith had to be dead by then for the plan to work.
But she couldn't have been killed before he left for work
Or that would skew the time of death.
The receptionist said Alan was in with mrs. Gold
When she got there at 8:00.
Her appointment was 6:30.
So, he worked on Mrs. Gold,
made sure she was completely anesthetized,
Left at 7:00?
This is me on the route to his house.
He gets there at 7:15.
Pulls on a Tyvek suit, gloves and a mask,
shoots Judith before she can kick his ass,
and then stabs her with the knife
that he stole from the handyman.
He drops the knife for us to find,
takes off the Tyvek suit, heads for the office.
7:40?
Yeah, but he's still got to get rid of the gun
and the bloody Tyvek suit.
I had some uniforms look through all the dumpsters
and trash barrels.
Public works searched the storm drains and sewers.
Nothing.
Yeah, he's too smart to leave anything close to the crime scene.
I know where Alan got rid of the gun and the Tyvek suit.
Strike Two!
Thank you.
I'll take that.
You can't just -- - We called your courier service.
They said you were expecting a delivery.
You have no right.
This gives us that right.
You absolutely, positively have to have it overnight.
Which you did.
Ruger, Bearcat, .22 caliber.
It was a slick move,
mailing yourself the only evidence
that'll tie you to your wife's murder.
All you had to do was throw the gun in the nearest lake
and burn the Tyvek suit in the woods.
Pretty smart.
But not smart enough. Strike Three.
At least I'm to scale.
You are so, so not to scale.
Look at those things on your chest.
Those things are perfect in form and balance.
Look at you. You're all leg.
Well, I'm exactly to scale
because, you know, Susie doesn't guess.
Well, she does now.
Ooh, here she comes.
Hello, Senior Criminalist Chang.
Very nice to see you, Susie.
Dr. Isles, detective.
You both look nice tonight.
What? Did -- she didn't even notice.
You had your right arm up a bit more.
I was not.
You weren't -- you weren't bending your foot right.
I don't bend my feet.
Objects in the die-o-rama appear bigger than they are.
Well, hers.
Which ones?
General comment.
Angela talked to you.
Yeah. That's why I'm here.
Me too.
I was thinking, when I go to next year's convention,
you should come with me.
Will they have "Autopsy Jeopardy"?
Yeah.
Then I'm gonna schedule surgery for that weekend.
Hey, look who's back in town.
Hi, honey.
Hi, Ma. Mwah.
Hey, aren't you two a little too old to be playing with dolls?
What? We brought them for Frankie.
Oh, you're a riot, Janie.
Hello, Boston!
Hello.
Uh, tonight's a very special night.
I'm gonna do some songs my grandfather wrote,
the way they were meant to be sung
and the way they were meant to be played.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am Bobby.
I'm Vince.
All right.
And tonight, we are Bobby&Vince.
Thanks.
