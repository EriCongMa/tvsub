第七季 第十五集
item 28 :
your pet name for me .
time &apos;s running out on this . you need to make a decision .
i submitted you a notarized list .
i &apos;m sorry , but &quot; gollum &quot; and &quot; flakey &quot; are not acceptable .
well , you don &apos;t like &quot; princess corncob &quot;
you don &apos;t like &quot; fester &quot; -- you &apos;re just impossible to please .
we &apos;ll come back to that one .
this brings us to the final item
in our annual state of the relationship summit .
item 29 : valentine &apos;s day .
ah , the worst for last .
classic flakey .
before you get upset , i believe i &apos;ve come up with
a way for us to celebrate the occasion
that we both can enjoy .
people usually start a meeting with a joke ,
but you go ahead-- end with one .
i propose we spend a weekend
at a bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast in napa valley .
i hate every word in that sentence .
including &quot; in &quot; &quot; at , &quot; &quot; we &quot; and &quot; a . &quot;
come on , sheldon . why not ?
for starters , a bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast forces you
to eat with strangers at your table .
one step ahead of you--
bernadette and wolowitz are going with us .
oh , very well .
what are the sleeping arrangements ?
we &apos;ve only been dating for three years .
if we were to share a room , people might talk .
i got you your own room .
what if my room has a claw @-@ foot bathtub ?
it doesn &apos;t .
i know it makes you feel like you &apos;re bathing inside a monster .
look , i appreciate the effort ,
but i &apos;m still unclear how this trip
is supposed to be enjoyable for me .
we &apos;re going to have valentine &apos;s day dinner
on a fully functioning vintage train .
vintage ? be specific .
an alcoa fa @-@ 4 diesel locomotive
leading a train of meticulously restored
1915 pullman first @-@ class coaches .
i &apos;m feeling the urge to hug you .
and one ... and two ...
all right , gollum , we &apos;re good .
are you sure you guys don &apos;t want to come with us to napa ?
you could probably still get a room .
no , i think we &apos;re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home .
plus , i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s a great idea
to take penny to where wine comes from .
what ? it &apos;s a joke .
oh , come on . we bust on each other .
i wear dorky glasses , you might have a problem--
it &apos;s all for laughs .
that would really piss me off if i didn &apos;t have a buzz going on .
howard , which pocket watch will you be wearing
for dinner on the train ?
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
oh , i &apos;m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch ,
it will be embarrassing .
i don &apos;t own a pocket watch .
oh , my .
well , then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot .
since you two are gonna be around for valentine &apos;s ,
would you mind watching cinnamon ?
you have valentine &apos;s plans ? !
which came out sounding way more surprised than i meant .
l @-@ let me try that again . you have val ...
see ? i can &apos;t do it .
i don &apos;t have plans , which is why i booked time
on the big telescope that night .
well , an evening looking at the stars--
that &apos;s still kind of romantic .
except i &apos;ll be alone .
i &apos;m trying to put lipstick on a pig here . work with me .
we &apos;d be happy to watch cinnamon .
yeah .
thank you .
oh , and i &apos;d like for at least one of us to see some action ,
so if you guys happen to have sex ,
it &apos;s cool if she stays in the room .
hey , same goes for the two of you with amy .
what do you think , sheldon ?
it &apos;s magnificent .
this is going to be the best valentine &apos;s day ever .
i &apos;m so glad you like it .
i &apos;m prepared to say i love it ,
as soon as i confirm there are no hobos aboard .
okay .
raj , i got it . bye .
that was your daddy .
he wanted me to say that he misses ...
why am i doing this ?
happy valentine &apos;s day !
ooh , flowers and chocolates ?
somebody &apos;s trying to get me out of my panties .
don &apos;t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing
and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out .
it came that way when i bought it .
got you a little something , too .
jewelry .
oh , my god .
lakers tickets ? !
it gets better . instead of me ,
you can take someone who will actually enjoy it .
you are the best boyfriend ever .
thank you .
seriously , please don &apos;t make me go .
should we take this little party to the bedroom ?
don &apos;t have to-- we have the whole place to ourselves .
oh , that &apos;s true .
in fact , if you want ,
we can do it right here on sheldon &apos;s spot .
that is the least sexy thing anyone &apos;s ever said to me .
to the bedroom !
and for the entree , tonight &apos;s special is a seafood risotto .
do you have any questions ?
uh , i do .
uh , does this train car have the original link @-@ and @-@ pin coupler
or the miller hook and platform ?
i &apos;m sorry , i meant questions about the food .
oh , of course . um ...
is the seafood risotto being served on a train car
with the original link @-@ and @-@ pin coupler
or the miller hook and platform ?
i @-@ i think we &apos;re gonna need a minute .
fun fact : it &apos;s neither .
they actually use the aar type e coupler .
if you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects ,
you &apos;ll hear the characteristic
click @-@ pshht @-@ thunk of the knuckle .
get out of town .
fun fact : i &apos;m gonna jump off this train .
hey , cinnamon ,
guess who just did it human style .
oh , my god !
it &apos;s a little late , but i &apos;ll take it .
no , cinnamon ate the chocolates .
that &apos;s really bad for dogs .
从而让狗狗中毒
oh , crap . what are we gonna do ?
we gotta get her to a vet right now .
i don &apos;t have a vet .
i have a podiatrist , an optometrist , an allergist ,
a dermatologist , a urologist .
you &apos;d think i &apos;d have a vet .
okay . there &apos;s one not far from here . come on . let &apos;s go .
okay . koothrappali was right .
we should have let her watch .
do another one , do another one !
okay .
here &apos;s my impression of the amtrak acela
barreling down the eastern corridor .
it &apos;s like there &apos;s a train in your mouth .
oh , yeah . i &apos;ve got one .
um , the amtrak wolverine coming into chicago .
i &apos;ve been on that train .
and i just was again .
hey , see if you guys can guess this one .
bang ! splat ! thud .
how many trains have you been on ?
tons .
a box fell on my head at ups six years ago .
now i just collect disability and ride trains .
your life &apos;s amazing .
not always .
a box fell on my head at ups six years ago .
now i just collect disability and ride trains .
why do i even try ?
i &apos;m gonna fix this right now .
okay .
just make it look like an accident .
excuse me .
you are at valentine &apos;s dinner with your girlfriend .
now get back over there and be with her .
you &apos;re right .
that was insensitive of me .
i have to go back to my table now .
you should join us .
all right .
great .
now there &apos;s two of &apos; em .
how much chocolate did she eat ?
a whole box .
well , to be fair ,
you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me .
so the point is i may have saved her life .
i &apos;m sorry , is this a joke to you ?
no .
maybe to her .
how big a box of chocolate was it ?
uh , something like this . i don &apos;t know .
it came free with a full tank of gas .
really ?
do you know how much those lakers tickets were ?
do you know how much gas is ?
sorry .
sorry .
oh , my god , cinnamon , are you okay ? !
i can &apos;t believe you two !
you do whatever it takes to save her life .
if she needs new organs , i &apos;ll buy any dog necessary
and scrap them for parts !
you &apos;re the owner ?
owner , father , soul mate ,
and if anything happens to her , your worst nightmare !
well , she &apos;s not throwing up ,
which is a good sign .
so , i &apos;m gonna take her in back , put her on fluids
and give her something to absorb the toxins .
okay ?
okay , thank you .
oh , if she &apos;s scared , you can sing to her .
she likes katy perry .
oh , but don &apos;t do &quot; firework &quot;
that gets her all riled up .
got it .
should have been a dentist .
okay , what was the best four @-@ ten @-@ four
u.s. locomotive ever built ?
trick question . there never was one .
or was there ?
what ? !
in 1944 , the pacific railroad built number 6131,
which rearranged the drivers and cylinders ,
solving the problem of the q @-@ 1,
creating a duplex @-@ drive four @-@ four @-@ six @-@ four .
in what world is
a four @-@ four @-@ six @-@ four a four @-@ ten @-@ four ?
a world i don &apos;t want to live in !
seriously , i no longer want to live in this world .
hold on to your conductor &apos;s hat .
you crank the second and third axles ,
creating a pair of internal connecting rods ,
and boom-- four @-@ ten @-@ four .
if you think about it , the q @-@ 2
was like the four @-@ ten @-@ four america never made .
i may never stop thinking about it .
amy , what are the odds we run into this guy ?
better than you think .
you know , if you ask nicely ,
they &apos;ll let you visit the engine room .
i never want this day to end .
it &apos;s feeling like it never will .
come on .
hey , did i tell you what happened to me at ups ?
as if valentine &apos;s day wasn &apos;t bad enough ,
you try to kill my dog ? !
and with cheap chocolate , no less ?
it wasn &apos;t cheap .
it was free .
we &apos;re really sorry . it was an accident .
yeah , we weren &apos;t even out of the room that long .
oh , no , come on . it was a while .
it was a while .
oh , is cinnamon gonna be okay ?
she &apos;s responding well .
we just want to keep her a little longer for observation .
all right . uh , would @-@ would it be okay for me to see her ?
we &apos;re usually in bed by now ,
and i want her to know that i &apos;m here .
yes , we sleep together , and sometimes we spoon .
it &apos;s okay . i sleep with my dog , too .
we &apos;re not supposed to let people in back ,
but i think i can make an exception .
thank you .
come on .
by the way , i sang her katy perry .
oh , yeah ?
and i don &apos;t care
what that obnoxious parrot back there says .
i crushed it .
i think there &apos;s something going on between the two of them .
maybe , but you also think nine minutes isn &apos;t a while ,
so what do you know ?
you okay ?
why ?
because my boyfriend &apos;s off playing choo @-@ choo with some weirdo ?
well , to be fair , they &apos;re both weirdos .
i don &apos;t know what made me think tonight would be any different .
well , just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot .
to be honest , i bet howie 200 bucks
it wasn &apos;t gonna happen .
i &apos;m going to the lego store to get a big @-@ ass r2 @-@ d2 .
see ? it &apos;s not just sheldon .
they &apos;re all idiots .
she &apos;s right .
so , your boyfriend &apos;s a fixer @-@ upper .
most of them are .
i mean , look at this guy .
you think he came like this ?
when i met him , he was a hot , goofy mess .
now , he &apos;s been to space .
that &apos;s all me .
i had a little to do with it .
oh , sure you did .
who &apos;s mama &apos;s big space man ?
i am .
they &apos;ve been in there , like , half an hour .
yeah , for future reference , that &apos;s a while .
how long should we stay ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m kind of hungry .
i saw a thai place next door .
oh . okay .
hey !
how &apos;s she doing ?
how is everything ?
yeah . she &apos;s gonna be okay ;
they &apos;re gonna let me take her home .
oh , good .
so i want you to keep a close eye on her
for the next 24 hours .
here are a few warning signs to look out for ,
and if you see any of them , don &apos;t hesitate to call .
thank you for taking such good care of my little girl .
my pleasure . have a nice night .
yes , thank you for all your help .

the conductor and i have the same pocket watch .
it was crazy .

oh , and , amy , guess what ?
the conductor said as soon as he gets off work ,
he can come back to the bed and breakfast
and play his banjo for us .
okay . i need to speak to my boyfriend in private ,
like , right now .
there &apos;s a car with a glass roof .
want to go look at the stars ?
oh , that sounds so romantic .

excuse me .
i think you &apos;re being a little rude .
i &apos;m being rude ?
you &apos;ve been rude to me this entire evening .
how is that possible ?
i &apos;ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train .
i &apos;m detecting a little friction between you two ,
and i don &apos;t want to be a third rail .
get it ?
i get it .
leave !
what is your problem ?
it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day .
we &apos;re supposed to be having a romantic weekend .
oh , really ? because i remember you saying
that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy .
did you mean that ,
or were you just trying to trick me ?
fine , it &apos;s true .
i deserve romance ,
and i didn &apos;t know how else to make it happen .
well , if you want romance , then let &apos;s have romance !
oh , look , there &apos;s wine .
grape juice that burns .
uh , now let &apos;s gaze into each other &apos;s eyes , hmm ?
you blinked . i win .
sheldon ...
let &apos;s see . what &apos;s next ?
oh , kissing &apos;s romantic .
that was nice .

the conductor said if i come back to the engine room ,
he &apos;d show me how to bring the train through a crossing .
okay , have fun .
do you want to come with me ?
really ? i do .
hey , guys , wait up !
there you go .
all cozy wozy .

&quot; rajesh , i was dreading valentine &apos;s day .
thank you for spending it with me . yvette . &quot;
cinnamon , she @-@ she gave me her phone number .
if i knew it was that easy ,
i would have considered poisoning you months ago .
oh , what should i say ?
oh , i know . i &apos;ll point out her name &apos;s yvette ,
and that she &apos;s a vet .
that &apos;s hysterical .
she &apos;ll love it .
hello .
you &apos;re back .
how was your trip ? it was wonderful !
great . what did you do ?
i made a new friend
who likes trains as much as i do ,
uh , i kissed amy on the lips ,
and , uh , the conductor played his banjo for me .
good night .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
i &apos;m gonna need more details .
oh , well , my new friend &apos;s name was eric .
um , amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert .
the banjo @-@ playing conductor
was missing a finger ,
but he made up for it with his can @-@ do attitude .
no , hang on . hang on .
are all those things equal to you ?
it never occurred to me to pick a favorite .
well , give it a go .
i can &apos;t answer that without collecting additional data .
additional data . you dog !
i &apos;m not sure how listening to other nine @-@ fingered banjo players
makes me dog , but all right .
