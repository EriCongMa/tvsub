gossip gril here ,
you &apos;re one of the resources
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i got into columbia .
what if columbia is a disaster ,
and we could lose each other for good .
and what if it &apos;s amazing
and we become closer than we &apos;ve ever been ?
i &apos;m not seeing anybody else ,
nor do i want to , if you don &apos;t .
last night--
don &apos;t even finish those words
unless--unless they end with &quot; was a mistake . &quot;
ben &apos;s my brother . he takes a lot of time and energy .
how are things going ?
the guys were easy , but the girls are presenting
a little bit more of a challenge .
i know what you did , blair .
it &apos;s despicable , even for you .
do you hate me so much you can &apos;t stand to see me happy ?
no .
why did you drive the person
i care most about out of town ?
you just brought back my worst self .
morning on the upper east side ,
where even our own blonde birdie
has been spotted flying the coop early
to make it to her morning classes .
leave it to serena van der woodsen
to make geek chic .
who knew ivy would look so good on her ?
hey ! hey ! hey ! are you kidding me ?
hey , you again .
yes , me again , getting my cab taken by you again .
nice bag . i like it better than the one you had the other day .
thank you . it &apos;s supposed to be at class with me .
i can &apos;t be late again , so if don &apos;t mind ...
sorry . she had an audition . something ...
i think a talking dog was involved .
yeah , i know the feeling .
why don &apos;t you let me make it up to you ?
buy you a drink sometime ?
are you seriously hitting on me
while still holding your date &apos;s shoes ?
well , if you change your mind ,
the king cole bar is the only place in town
that still makes a red snapper .
you look like you &apos;re about a size 8 ?
taxi !
indra nooyi , ann moore , andrea jung .
why are these all businesswomen ?
we color @-@ coded for easy reference .
businesswomen are in green .
women in academia are in blue .
politics and government in red
with a subsection on royalty and dictators .
ooh , files . what &apos;s going on ?
researching women of power
so i can better forge my path to become one .
sarah louise palin ?
do you even want to be a minion ?
b. , uh , can i talk to you for a minute ?
i need advice .
yes . five paces behind for privacy .
ten for you .
how are you ? i &apos;ve barely seen you all week .
uh , i &apos;ve been great .
you know , with dan and nate behind me ,
i really feel like i can bury the old me and start anew .
may you rest in peace .
the only problem is , i &apos;ve been late
for my english lit class a few times ,
and lates count as absences , which is 10 % --
oh , if only there were a device of some kind to keep the time .
s. , listen to me .
college professors have a god complex ,
so just meet with him and say you &apos;re sorry .
the simplest way to turn an enemy into a friend
is to seek their counsel .
who taught you that ?
one of your asian &quot; art of war &quot; gurus ?
martha chamberlin .
she &apos;s guest lecturing a series called
the psychology of business .
i &apos;m heading to the registrar &apos;s to sign up .
oh , i love her . b. , how do you do it ?
chuck declares war , and you simply up your class load .
the more time i spend on campus , the safer i am .
chuck is allergic to education and bettering himself .
well , i &apos;m not , so if i &apos;m gonna work on my new self ,
i should head to the library .
sign me up for martha &apos;s class . we &apos;ll go together .
your guitar tuner ? really ?
you have the worst poker face ever .
okay . fine . dan hasn &apos;t been returning my calls ,
and i wanted to make sure everything was okay with you guys .
everything is better than okay .
dan and i had a marathon talk--
everything that we haven &apos;t dealt with , including serena .
and from now on , there &apos;s no more secrets or surprises .
well , that &apos;s great .
never doubted you guys for a second .
seriously ?
you need to practice in the mirror or something .
i don &apos;t know how they let you live on the upper east side .
that &apos;s great you and vanessa sorted everything out , dan .
you know , we should double .
juliet and i are going to this faculty and friends mixer
tomorrow night at the hamilton house .
you guys wanna come ?
mm , no .
there &apos;s free appetizers , humphrey .
oh . okay . fine . you wanna go see a movie afterward ?
no can do .
oh , come on .
it doesn &apos;t even have to have subtitles .
that sounds great .
no , juliet and i have this nice little evening planned after the mixer .
got some champagne , new matteo sheets ,
and i &apos;m hoping some recently purchased lingerie .
it &apos;s for her , right ?
wait a second . i &apos;m sorry . you guys haven &apos;t ,
no , i haven &apos;t . no .
i did the spend the night at her place ,
but i took a page from the old humphrey playbook ,
and we just talked and played scrabble .
that &apos;s nice .
thanks .
by the way , thank you for , inviting me today .
you know , after everything that &apos;s happened between us--
yeah , yeah . i missed you , too .
no hugs . you &apos;re not getting a hug .
not one ?
not one .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t visit last week .
things are really ramping up at school .
the good news is that serena is now isolated from both dan and nate .
what about blair ?
blair will get distracted eventually .
oh , come on . it was only a few weeks ago
i went after serena at hamilton house .
if i get caught trying to get her expelled , it &apos;s over .
not if you have a fall guy .
maybe ...
someone with pretty blue eyes and a history with serena ?
have you been spying on me ?
spying implies a lack of trust ,
and i know that i can trust you .
i &apos;m only dating nate to stay in serena &apos;s orbit .
good , because we agreed that
we would not stop until serena was left with nothing ,
just like i was .
and the next thing to take from her is columbia .
and seeing as how you &apos;re in with these people ,
it shouldn &apos;t be too hard , right ?
i know what to do .
there you are .
where do i sign up for ms. chamberlin &apos;s lecture series ?
what are you doing here ?
go , lions .
no . that &apos;s impossible , even for you .
the dean &apos;s extended me the courtesy of auditing a few classes .
we felt it was important i get a feel for campus life
before breaking ground on the new bart bass memorial rotunda .
what ?
it &apos;s a building with a circular ground plan , usually covered by a dome .
i know what a rotunda is ! you can &apos;t be here .
columbia &apos;s mine . what do you want ?
funny , last time we spoke , i thought i was crystal clear .
you took away what i cared about most .
to return the favor , i &apos;m going to take columbia away from you .
come back later
and sign me and serena up for martha &apos;s class .
but do it quietly . i don &apos;t want chuck to know .
go !
this just in--
looks like you can take the girl out of the party ,
but not the party out of the girl .
rumor has it our favorite blonde
could be spreading more than just good cheer .
and if it &apos;s true , then there &apos;s a test out there
a few of you might not be able to pass .
does s.v.w. have an s.t.d. ?
i mean , who would lie to gossip girl like that ?
do you really want a list ?
because i don &apos;t know if i have that kind of time .
a good scandal is one thing , but even gossip girl
likes to keep things classy and somewhat true .
i just wanted to focus on school .
well , don &apos;t let this stop you .
without someone confirming the rumor ,
it &apos;ll blow over by lunch .
and just keep doing what you &apos;re doing . hold your head high .
this is our school . we were here first .
damn him to hell .
why do i get the feeling
your pep talk is not entirely meant for me ?
chuck is here , at columbia .
wow . he &apos;s bringing the battle to campus ?
yes . well , i already have a battle plan .
i found out that martha chamberlin takes a student assistant
when she lectures .
that position will be my own private island
against the storm that is chuck bass .
if you &apos;re not gonna let a disease like chuck deter you ,
what leg do i have to stand on ?
i &apos;m gonna go plant myself in the quad ,
act like i don &apos;t have a care in the world ,
and e @-@ mail my professor to see when he can meet .
okay , it says here that you both slept with serena ...
and vanessa , and that vanessa also slept with chuck ...
yeah .
who slept with blair ?
all that &apos;s on &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
yeah , she made a chart , actually ,
which i have to say is very helpful .
oh , god .
can we talk ?
yeah .
thank you for meeting me before your game .
i just--i thought that we should talk about this
before we spend our first night together .
you know it &apos;s just a rumor . it &apos;s not true .
and even if it was ,
i haven &apos;t slept with serena since ,
like , last spring .
so ?
so i think i would , you know , know .
nate , symptoms can be dormant for months
or not even appear at all . you could still be a carrier .
what ?
i &apos;m a girl .
i paid attention in health class .
so you want me to get tested ?
i mean , i &apos;m not worried , but if it makes you feel better ,
i &apos;ll swing by the health clinic after the game .
thank you . and i promise you ,
when you see the outfit i bought for tomorrow night ,
it &apos;ll be well worth it .
vanessa , like i told you on the phone ,
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s totally false .
and--and what business is it of yours anyway ?
you and i both got tested
when we first started sleeping together . you remember that ?
i sure do , and i have not been with anyone else since .
dan , serena was sleeping in your bed
and wearing your t @-@ shirt .
if something else happened , i need to know .
nothing else happened .
w @-@ what--what happened to our big talk ?
&apos;cause honestly , i don &apos;t know if i can have
this same conversation one more time .
i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s just--the blast freaked me out .
it &apos;s okay . i promise .
i promise you have nothing to worry about .
all right ? i &apos;ll call you after the game .
serena . hi .
how are you ?
great . why wouldn &apos;t i be ? if you &apos;re referring to
the unconfirmed vicious rumor on &quot; gossip girl , &quot;
you wouldn &apos;t have anything to do with that , would you ?
no . look , i just came over here to tell you the way
our english lit professor called you out
in front of the entire class ? you didn &apos;t deserve that .
and if there &apos;s anything that i can do ...
no , i already e @-@ mailed him .
i &apos;m hoping to talk with him myself tomorrow .
good .
well , anyhow ...
i really didn &apos;t have anything to do with that blast .
believe me , it &apos;s the last thing i would &apos;ve wanted .
what do you mean ?
nate sort of freaked when he saw it .
freaked how ? he doesn &apos;t believe it .
thanks for coming with me , man .
no problem . i shouldn &apos;t have told you
about the cotton swab thing . that was insensitive .
but , you know , just think about how happy you &apos;ll be
with a clean bill of health tomorrow , right ?
yeah . yeah .
what the hell are you doing ?
and you ? it &apos;s been what , two years ?
i &apos;m a wingman .
you wanna go sign me in and i &apos;ll see you in there in a minute ?
yeah , i &apos;ll step away now .
all right , cool .
nate , i know all about your summer of love
from chuck &apos;s little black book , and honestly , for your sake ,
i hope you do get tested . but if you do it today ,
people will just think that you believe the blast .
you &apos;ll be confirming the rumor . please .
please just wait a few days or go somewhere else .
serena , there &apos;s someone else i need to do this for . okay ?
and right now she &apos;s my priority , not you .
可不是睡前一吻这么简单
ms. chamberlin &apos;s largest client to date ?
national rifle association .
she created the mama bears campaign ,
increased female membership by a third .
and the cherry pie ?
her first major success was branding a cherry pie recipe
for &quot; better homes and gardens . &quot;
how do you get from &quot; better homes and gardens &quot;
to the n.r.a. ?
it &apos;s a short trip , believe me .
ms. chamberlin ? i &apos;m blair waldorf .
i &apos;ll be in your psychology of business class .
well , nice to meet you . i &apos;m not having office hours yet--
actually , i was hoping we could discuss the assistant position .
i &apos;m a big fan .
unfortunately , the position has been filled .
by who ?
ms. chamberlin , whatever mr. bass has told you ,
i assure you , he has no interest in your class
or any idea who you even are .
thank you ?
on the contrary , once i decided to rebrand the empire ,
there was only one name on my list .
we can talk more as i walk you to your limo .
thank you .
good day , ms. waldorf .
if you have any questions regarding the class ,
mr. bass will answer them .
actually , it turns out
ms. chamberlin &apos;s class is overenrolled .
you didn &apos;t make the cut . sorry .
i almost forgot how much i used to enjoy your pie .
better batten down the hatches , b.
looks like your island in the storm
was just hit by a bass 5 hurricane .
where are you off to ?
uh , campus .
my professor agreed to meet with me during office hours .
oh , good for you .
we can &apos;t let the men of our past define us .
they want us to lash out , lower ourselves to their level .
but it is our job to remain civilized .
so you &apos;re gonna let chuck have the assistant position then ?
i said &quot; civilized , &quot; not &quot; lobotomized . &quot;
oh , ms. chamberlin . so good of you to come .
earl grey , if i &apos;m not mistaken ?
what is going on ?
it &apos;s better not to know .
plausible deniability .
ms. waldorf , the only reason i agreed to meet with you
is because your mother and i have crossed paths on occasion ,
and i felt it a professional courtesy .
oh . did you know that my mother remarried ? amazing man .
your point ?
i was sorry to hear about your unfortunate divorce
a few years ago .
i beg your pardon ?
oh , boy .
you and i both know that
power is the greatest aphrodisiac .
except , of course , when women have it .
your ex @-@ husband , for example .
i mean , the nanny ? how clich ?
i &apos;m listening .
my stepfather has surrounded himself with people
who are not intimidated by a woman &apos;s success .
one of the partners at his firm is exceptionally attractive .
and i don &apos;t mean to sound forward ,
but i &apos;d love to introduce you
at the hamilton house party tonight .
well , i was going to be at the party anyway , so ...
well , then i &apos;ll make the call .
that is , of course ,
if the assistant position is still available .
let &apos;s just say that nothing is set in stone .
hmm . i &apos;m sorry . did you say scone ?
no ! no , no , no , no !
i don &apos;t care how late she is for her audition .
flight attendant . so quick to judge .
how &apos;s school going ?
terrible , which is why i can &apos;t be late .
you know , if it helps ,
i could get you a copy of my schedule .
so we can stop doing this . come on .
why would we want to do that ?
you put a different girl into a cab every day .
if you think i would ever be one of them ,
you are out of your mind .
i think nothing of the sort .
in fact , i leave at this time on purpose ,
hoping to get to see you .
good . then i &apos;m taking the cab . scoot over .
hey . what are you doing here ?
hey . uh , uh , lily &apos;s not around , right ?
uh , she and eric are visiting colleges .
it &apos;s just us . why ?
okay , well , there--there &apos;s-- there &apos;s a rumor going around
that serena has , um ...
she has--she has something .
has something ?
yeah . please get there faster .
oh . y @-@ you mean ... oh . oh , boy .
yeah . yeah . it &apos;s not true .
but there was a picture
of me with nate yesterday at the health center .
so now i &apos;m pretty sure vanessa thinks that
something more than a kiss happened
between me and serena .
well , did it ?
no , no , and i &apos;ve told her that a hundred times .
but she slept in the other room last night ,
and when i woke up , she wasn &apos;t there .
what ? i @-@ i mean , i thought you &apos;d be glad that i was sharing with you .
i am . i am . but you &apos;re not gonna like what i have to say .
serena is a formidable woman ,
and what you guys shared was a big love .
you can &apos;t blame vanessa for being insecure .
so if you wanna be with her , you need to show her
that she doesn &apos;t have anything to be worried about .
i &apos;ve told her that , but i &apos;m not gonna stop talking to serena ,
cut her out of my life .
all i &apos;m saying is , at least for right now ,
vanessa needs to know
that she &apos;s the only one you care about .
i need to talk to you .
oh , i &apos;m in a hurry . now &apos;s not a good time .
you need to tell me
what happened between you and dan that night .
isn &apos;t that a conversation you should be having with him ?
i did , but i can &apos;t trust him
when it comes to you .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
let &apos;s just say
it wouldn &apos;t be the first time a guy had lied to his girlfriend
to cover up a night spent with you .
you know , vanessa , you always wanna believe
the worst in people . why change now ?
exactly .
glad to see you took me up on my offer .
i hope you like my signature martinis .
i &apos;m tired of making dossiers and carrying cherry pies .
this would be good practice
if i ever decide to take blair down myself .
well , don &apos;t get ahead of yourself ,
but i appreciate the enthusiasm .
what did you find out ?
hi . i just got your text . what &apos;s up ?
yeah , i just found out that test results
could take three or four days to get back .
three or four days .
i can &apos;t believe our night &apos;s being derailed by this .
unless ...
there &apos;s another way that we can know for sure .
i mean , serena must &apos;ve talked or e @-@ mailed someone
about whether the rumors were true or not .
i guess i could talk to blair .
yeah . she &apos;d probably take the fifth .
how else are we gonna find out ?
no .
forget it .
i just think the anticipation is making me crazy .
well , i &apos;m gonna go home .
we should both get ready . and i am gonna start ...
by taking a cold shower .
bye .
i think we &apos;re ready .
you think ?
oh , i can &apos;t just come out
and ask him to steal serena &apos;s phone .
but trust me , he &apos;s right where we need him to be .
good . if anything goes wrong , it &apos;ll be on him .
right . just like we planned .
i have to go .
vanessa . what are you doing up here ?
i think dan and serena slept together last spring
when we were still going out .
oh , my god . are you sure ?
no . that &apos;s the problem . they both deny it .
i &apos;m sorry to unload on you like this .
i &apos;m just--i feel like i &apos;m losing my mind .
well , then you have to find out for sure .
how ?
i think i might have an idea .
that is , of course , if you &apos;re up for it .
yeah . right now i &apos;m up for anything , believe me .
then call dan . tell him that you wanna talk
and we &apos;ll meet him and nate at hamilton house tonight .
are you sure ?
trust me .
things have a way of working out when you least expect it .
where have you been ?
i know i &apos;m late . again .
so i take it the meeting with your professor did not go well .
it didn &apos;t go at all . i didn &apos;t make it .
you know there &apos;s a clock on your cell phone , right ?
yes . yes , but it wasn &apos;t my fault , but i e @-@ mailed him
and begged for five minutes of his time tonight .
then we settle all columbia business tonight .
and it just so happens that ms. chamberlin--
b. , can i just wish you good luck
and take plausible deniability on this one ?
luck not needed , but right back at ya .
you &apos;re a natural .
i said serena forgot something .
one smile at the coat check guy and he handed it right over .
now check her e @-@ mail .
if serena and dan slept together ,
there &apos;s bound to be a message about the rumor .
this feels very wrong .
it &apos;s the only way you &apos;ll know for sure .
there &apos;s an e @-@ mail from dan a few hours ago .
what ?
&quot; if vanessa thinks
&quot; something more than a kiss happened between us
&quot; even though it didn &apos;t , i need to show her
i &apos;m willing to do whatever it takes to make things work . &quot;
well , now you have your answer .
we have to put this back right now .
wait , wait , wait , wait . my boyfriend dated her , too .
you &apos;re not the only one with serena insecurity .
okay , well , then hurry up .
shoot . i think someone &apos;s coming .
coast is clear . well ?
nothing , thank god . come on . let &apos;s get outta here .
okay , wait . i told dan that i needed to talk .
what--what do i say now ?
he &apos;s a guy . do you think he really wants to talk ?
just take him home
and show him you &apos;re ready to move on .
twice if necessary .
thank you .
nate &apos;s a lucky guy .
you guys make a really good couple .
yeah , we do , don &apos;t we ?
pardon the interruption , but you have an important call .
blair waldorf .
i &apos;m ms. chamberlin &apos;s new assistant .
confident , i see .
when destiny calls ? always .
especially when it arrives right on time .
nothing says &quot; soul mate &quot; like punctuality .
hey , vanessa .
dan .
nate , um , juliet &apos;s looking for you .
thank you .
hey .
hey . what &apos;s going on ?
what do you mean ?
i just mean , like , why are you-- why are you smiling so much ?
i &apos;m just--i &apos;m-- i &apos;m glad to see you .
i thought--i thought you were mad at me .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m confused here .
okay , wait a second . now--now-- now i &apos;m really confused .
you--you said we needed to talk .
we already did . i just--i wasn &apos;t listening .
what do you say we get out of here ?
and i &apos;ll show you how much we don &apos;t need to talk .
i don &apos;t know . i mean ...
i &apos;m pretty stubborn . it might take all night .
well , then i guess you &apos;ll need your strength .
let &apos;s load up on free appetizers before we leave .
hamilton house is where dreams come true .
on that we agree .
there . shall we ?
beautiful scarf .
oh , well , as we work together ,
you &apos;ll come to find that your tastes are my tastes .
guess who .
sam . hi .
i must say , blair did not do you justice .
i know the feeling .
you thought this was my special someone ?
no .
i mean , unless ...
what ? since i &apos;m a powerful career @-@ driven woman
who intimidates men , i must be a lesbian ?
no . this was not the date i set up .
he was an intellectual property lawyer
who does pro bono work helping kids sue hollywood
for stealing their twitter ideas .
then i suggest you see if he needs an assistant .
my class is full ... forever .
great scarf , by the way .
dean reuther , serena van der woodsen .
professor lawford ,
i &apos;m so sorry i didn &apos;t make our meeting this morning .
but as i mentioned in my e @-@ mail ,
i &apos;m hoping to impress upon you--upon both of you--
that i &apos;m willing to do whatever it takes
to succeed at this school .
yes , the e @-@ mail that you sent to professor lawford
makes that pretty clear .
i &apos;m sorry ?
perhaps we should have this conversation in private .
and what conversation would that be ?
the one regarding your e @-@ mail that offers sex for grades .
what ?
i @-@ i @-@ i didn &apos;t do that . i would never do that .
this is your e @-@ mail address , is it not ?
yes , but i @-@ i didn &apos;t send this .
ms. van der woodsen , obviously we pay no mind
to childish rumors that circulate all college campuses ,
but this e @-@ mail is extremely serious .
the consequence of sending it , i &apos;m afraid , is expulsion .
expulsion ?
spotted--
serena van der woodsen looking like she &apos;s hot for teacher .
that &apos;s the thing about a good gaslight--
with enough smoke , who cares if there &apos;s really a fire ?
did you send that e @-@ mail ,
the one that came from serena &apos;s phone
offering sex to her professor ?
what ? why would i do that ?
if you ask me , it sounds like an idea
that serena would get all on her own .
i don &apos;t think she would do that .
i &apos;m gonna tell her we had her phone .
wait . don &apos;t .
maybe if we had access to it ,
then somebody else did as well .
i didn &apos;t send that e @-@ mail .
but if you tell her that we took her phone ,
she is gonna blame us ,
and i could get expelled .
and so could she .
if you didn &apos;t send it ,
then you have nothing to worry about .
where is martha &apos;s date ? !
penthouse suite at the empire .
with a woman i assure you
he won &apos;t want to leave until morning ,
maybe afternoon . depends on his cardio .
i was going to play nice .
you think i don &apos;t have a plan &quot; b &quot; ?
plan &quot; b &quot; ?
what could be more cunning
and devious than date night ?
i had dorota get chummy with martha &apos;s maid ,
who came over from one of her sweatshops
in the philippines .
if i have to , i &apos;ll blackmail her for the position .
an illegal maid scandal ?
nobody &apos;s cared about those in years .
and a lesbian switcheroo
doesn &apos;t make you blackwater .
the switcheroo was for fun .
the i.r.s. agent is standing by
to crawl up martha &apos;s audit is not .
a tax fraud setup ?
they give away girl scout badges for that .
i have her prenup . it has details .
i have the nanny . she has pictures .
martha &apos;s ex is in them . so is martha .
it turns out it was a threesome
oh , my god ! you students are psychotic .
i have better things to do with my time .
tell the dean i quit .
shame .
sounded like a great class .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;ve heard good things
about the make @-@ your @-@ own @-@ pizza bar .
my phone isn &apos;t in here .
whoever stole it must &apos;ve been the person
that sent the e @-@ mail .
a missing cell phone is hardly proof .
i &apos;ll see you in my office on monday ,
and we &apos;ll talk about what &apos;s next .
good night , jim .
please don &apos;t do this . you don &apos;t go to columbia .
they can &apos;t do anything to you .
i &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s the right thing to do .
wait .
serena ...
call your phone .
maybe the person who stole it might still be here .
hey . hey , what &apos;s going on ?
vanessa stole my phone
and sent an e @-@ mail to my professor .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s crazy .
really ? do you wanna answer that ?
i &apos;ll speak with you later .
i can explain .
you took serena &apos;s phone ?
she thinks we slept together .
wait , you were the one
behind the &quot; gossip girl &quot; rumor .
what ? no !
i @-@ i know how this looks ,
but i did not send out that e @-@ mail .
juliet did . she &apos;s the one
who wanted to steal your phone in the first place .
w--are you kidding me ? !
there is no way that
i &apos;m getting dragged into this .
i wasn &apos;t gonna say anything ,
but vanessa came to me today .
she asked me to help her get revenge ,
and i told her no .
that is a lie !
no , it &apos;s not . juliet told me before the party .
she was hoping to talk to vanessa
and calm her down .
but ... i &apos;m sorry , man .
wait , is that why you were so happy earlier
and you wanted to get outta here ?
yeah , with my phone ,
so that she could get rid of the evidence .
and make sure i was expelled .
i did not do this .
after everything we &apos;ve been through ,
i &apos;m asking you to please believe me .
i don &apos;t know what to believe right now .
vanessa--
don &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ? i @-@ i wanted to be friends ,
but what did you expect me to do ?
i had to protect myself .
you &apos;re right . you do .
poor v.
didn &apos;t she know that in love and war ,
a friend in need is willing to do most any deed ?
i believe you didn &apos;t send that e @-@ mail ,
but i can &apos;t ignore
the level of drama that has followed you to my campus
and grown even louder since you arrived .
meaning ?
women of my generation had to fight for every opportunity
and to be taken seriously ,
and your attitude , ms. van der woodsen ,
makes a mockery of that .
if i were you ,
i would rethink my priorities .
good night .
ms. waldorf ,
i have my eye on you as well .
plausible deniability was a good call .
and speaking of denials ,
you &apos;ve been cleared in the court of public opinion .
gossip girl sent out an official retraction
and personal apology to you about the rumor .
not to mention , she said whatever person sent it
is now on her hit list .
yeah , well , it was vanessa .
vanessa ?
yeah , well , gossip girl &apos;s scorn
will only increase her social standing .
how did you figure it out ?
uh , ironically , it was juliet who i have to thank for that .
if you &apos;ll excuse me .
i was just telling blair
i have you to thank for clearing my name .
i know we got off on the wrong foot , but ...
it &apos;s just because
i was jealous of how much you meant to nate ,
and i &apos;m sorry .
boys will do it almost every time .
now if they weren &apos;t so darn cute ...
are you sure you &apos;re gonna be okay ?
yeah .
do you maybe wanna grab a drink with us ?
uh , no .
i actually just wanna get outta here .
i &apos;ll see you in class .
yeah . don &apos;t be late .
what are you still doing here ?
i lost the assistant position .
the entire faculty thinks i &apos;m just as crazy as you .
you &apos;ve made your point .
can &apos;t you take your little celebration elsewhere ?
if you think i &apos;d take tonight
as some sort of balancing of the scales , i don &apos;t .
i &apos;m not trying to make a point , blair .
this is just a warm @-@ up .
whatever you want , wherever you want it ,
i am going to be there to take it away from you .
i won &apos;t stop until you have nothing .
you wouldn &apos;t go that far .
who knows my limits
since you took away my future ?
that wasn &apos;t your future .
that was henry prince &apos;s .
destroying me won &apos;t make you happy .
happier .
the only thing
that will make you happy ,
you lost the moment you slept with jenny humphrey .
and that was the best thing that ever happened to me ,
because ...
i got over you forever .
if that &apos;s the truth ,
then why haven &apos;t you told anyone about jenny ?
not your family , not your minions ,
not gossip girl .
i know you &apos;re not keeping that secret to protect me .
you wouldn &apos;t .
that revelation would result in mutual destruction .
you may be homicidal , but you &apos;re not suicidal .
a man with nothing to live for
is capable of anything .
i &apos;m gonna stay with my parents for a little while .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s probably a good idea .
i think i could use some time alone , too .
dan , it &apos;s really important to me
that you know i didn &apos;t start any rumors
or send out that e @-@ mail .
i @-@ i believe you , i think .
but it doesn &apos;t change the fact that you didn &apos;t believe me .
i know that now .
it &apos;s just too bad that it took losing you to figure it out .
the red snapper .
excellent choice .
what do you think ?
i think it &apos;s a bloody mary with an inferiority complex .
fair enough .
so ...
drinking alone , are we ?
you &apos;ve made it pretty clear you &apos;re out of my league .
what do you have to lose by answering ?
i &apos;d prefer not to encourage this kind of behavior .
tell you what .
one drink , one question .
tell me why you &apos;re drinking alone ,
and i &apos;ll tell you anything you want .
i thought i could start over ,
but it turns out
college is just high school with more expensive books .
there &apos;s no ... starting over .
no matter where i go ,
whatever i do ,
my past seems to follow me .
so ...
what about you ?
why are you with a different girl every night ?
because i stopped apologizing for my past
a long time ago .
does that really work ?
does that actually make you happy ?
it did .
the law of affinity refers to
unlikely compositions forming a bond
through a purely chemical reaction .
why didn &apos;t you stick to the plan ?
like i said the first time ,
i thought vanessa was the better option .
well , she wasn &apos;t .
serena didn &apos;t get expelled .
but now i &apos;m in with serena ,
and i can become her confidant
and find something even bigger to take her down with .
good , &apos; cause now you have no choice .
and i &apos;d better not find out that this was about protecting nate .
if you &apos;re falling for him ...
i &apos;m not . i swear .
i guess i have to trust you .
yeah , i guess you do .
but even the strongest bonds have their limits ...
and when broken ...
you sure about this ?
mm @-@ hmm . now that we know vanessa was behind the rumors ...
absolutely .
that if left unchecked ...
explode like a nuclear bomb .
veronica , do you still work with tim gunn ?
i need to get an interview for someone
who will be applying to parsons .
perfect .
yeah , her name &apos;s jenny humphrey .
thanks .
waiting for the fallout .
