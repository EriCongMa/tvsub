Why would I give this to Hanna?
If this came out, I could lose my job.
I just can't ever picture Alison wearing this.
Well, picture Vivian Darkbloom.
Vivian told you about Alison?
She said she had a friend named Alison
who was getting texts from somebody.
If this Jonah had real information,
Ali might've known who "A" was.
There was something else in that box.
$15,000 in cash.
Where would Ali have gotten that kind of money?
Ezra is leaving.
He's taking that job in New Orleans.
What job?
The job that dad set him up with.
What does the Dilaurentis family have on us?
It's complicated.
My dad, is he your father too?
Melissa doesn't know either.
Don't protect her. She lied to us.
Caleb sent me an e-mail.
She's coming upstairs.
Are we about to see Alison get killed?
Where is she?
Emily Fields?
Yes?
We need to talk to you.
About what?
Maya St. Germain.
So, what'd they say?
Not a lot.
The police said that Maya's parents found a note.
It looked like she packed a bag.
Do they know where she went?
They were asking the questions, not me.
That's not fair. You're her girlfriend.
Maybe. She hasn't returned any of my texts.
Anyways, Hanna, I'm really tired.
Did you tell them that?
That I'm tired?
No.
About the texts.
Emily, every detail counts.
I told them that we got into a fight
and that Maya threatened
to run away before she'd ever go back to boot-camp.
That's what she did.
She'll call, Em. Okay?
It wasn't like I went running to the cops.
You lied to me and then you got in a car with Garrett Reynolds,
I saw you.
I didn't want you to worry.
I thought if you knew that I was talking to the police--
Why him?
Garrett was Ian's friend.
And he's been really kind to me since the funeral.
He checks in on me,
he takes me to the doctor when he can
and... I needed someone to talk to.
About what?
About Ian.
I still don't believe that I married the guy
who was capable of killing Alison.
The night of the funeral I wanted to talk to you about this.
I've been holding on to this--
this feeling that something was wrong ever since then.
So you went to Garrett about it last night.
I did, but--
I think it was a mistake.
I've shared a lot with him.
Maybe too much.
Like what?
Do you remember that summer?
It seemed like mom and dad were constantly fighting.
The day Alison went missing, it stopped.
And I don't think it was a coincidence.
Dad, he had a really strange reaction when he heard the news.
It was--
it was almost like he was relieved.
I'm listening. Go on.
One night before she disappeared,
I came home late.
Dad was up, something was bothering him,
but I didn't notice at first.
I was a wreck myself.
I had caught Alison flirting with Ian again.
I-- I sent texts to--
Ali?
Telling her to back the hell off.
I told dad everything. I didn't know what else to do.
Did you sign these texts?
I didn't have to. She knew who they were from.
Yeah, so what'd dad say?
Nothing.
He just had this look like he supported me.
And you told this to Garrett.
Ugh. I never should've opened up to him.
I was just venting, trying to sort through my feelings.
This is not good.
Why?
Melissa, we're not the only people who know about Jason.
Dad might've been blackmailed.
What? By who?
Alison.
Jason found cash, a lot of it.
Ali was hiding it, and I asked dad about it.
The blackmail?
And he told me that he never paid Alison a cent.
Do we believe that?
So, your father is coming home from his conference today.
And?
And I know he's very excited about the father/daughter dance.
Yeah, well, the father/daughter dance
is a little more irony than I can handle right now.
Well, maybe you should learn to embrace the irony
because there seems to be a lot of it in our lives.
Mom, if you could just talk to dad
and try and convince him.
Honey, at this point,
I don't even know what I'd be trying to convince him of.
Wait.
What happened to last night's
"I'm trying to understand you and Ezra."
I still am. It's a process.
For now, I don't think your father really needs to know about it.
Hello?
Hey, Ashley.
I told you not to call me at home.
I take it that means that you haven't talked to your daughter
about where she got that report.
I gave it to you so you could come up with some answers.
I'm trying to keep Hanna out of it.
Out of it? She's right in the middle of it.
Well, so are you.
My daughter is being targeted,
and you need to find out who's doing this to her.
Unless you'd like me to talk to someone else in the department.
Don't call me at the house again.
Ashley, I--
Ashley.
Good morning.
Not really.
I just got off the phone with dad.
He bailed on tomorrow night's dance.
Said he had a prior commitment.
Work or business.
But, whatever.
I mean, I was over that dance last year.
You know, I could take you to the dance.
Hello? Father/daughter.
What, you think you're the only girl
with divorced parents whose dad can't make it?
No, but I'd be the only one lame enough
to show up and advertise it.
I can take the heat.
I think missing out on something you're looking forward to
is lamer than going with your mother.
Okay. Let's do it.
Me and you.
"Do mom and dad know you're watching murder movies?
That would kill them to find out. 'A'"
Is "A" talking about the N .A .T. Video?
Of course. "A" knows we have their cell phone.
You guys get that text from "A"?
Yes, and now Melissa's threatening to kill our parents.
I already told you, Melissa can't be "A."
Alison was getting texts
from the law firm your sister interned at.
Yes, but she explained that.
Melissa just wanted Ali to leave Ian alone.
So what? What, I got chased by a hobo for nothing?
That still doesn't explain why Melissa got into Garrett's car.
Do you think Garrett told her about the video?
Cause if she knows that she's on it and if she's "A"--
You guys, my sister is not "A."
I watched her fall apart when we found Ian's body.
She had no idea that he was dead.
She wouldn't just text herself from her dead husband's phone
and lose it like that. Could we--
could we please just breathe for a second?
No. We have video of four people who could've killed Alison.
Okay? They were in her bedroom the night she died.
Can't we get in trouble for withdrawing evidence?
I think you mean withholding.
Look, Spencer's right.
We've jumped the gun before.
We've gone to the cops.
And we ended up looking guilty.
Yeah, and they already think that we stole something from the morgue.
I don' think that we should give this to them.
Look, I know that I'm asking a lot,
but, I think that I might have a way to find out more.
So, can you guys just give me a chance to get into this?
Okay.
I have got to find an obstetrician in the city.
all this back and forth for these appointments is just--
From dad?
"Looking forward to the dance."
Wow. Dad went a little bit overboard.
It's called overcompensating.
He still believes he can use his money to shut people up.
Melissa, I'm not going there, okay?
Dad did not pay off Ali.
We were both lied to, Spence.
This necklace is nothing but his guilt talking.
Yeah, but being Jason's father is not the same thing
as what you're thinking about.
I'm thinking that he has a lot to cover up for.
Oh, you opened it.
I wanted to see the look on your face.
It's-- it's just so--
Speechless.
You see that? Exactly what I was going for.
Come here.
Now, you have to promise me
you're gonna wear it to the dance tomorrow night, okay?
Sure. Promise.
Thanks for meeting me here.
I don't want these conversations to be overheard any more than you do.
Do you have something?
A request.
I already told you. I've tried talking to Hanna.
She's not giving anything up.
But her phone will.
You want her phone.
I need to know who she's been talking to.
Whom she's been texting.
Whoever gave her that report is in Hanna's world.
She's probably talked to them,
and she's definitely talked to her friends about them.
I don't think I could do that.
Well, think about it again, Ashley.
Cause if we want answers,
then you need to get me that phone.
So, where's Caleb?
He's in Montecito for the weekend,
visiting his parents.
Tough life, huh?
Yeah.
Have you heard from "A" again?
No. Good thing too.
They say the punishment's supposed to fit the crime,
but this community service gig,
is like the ninth circle of hell.
Okay, it can't be that bad.
Today I went from the soup kitchen to the senior center.
I've gone from shopping carts to walkers.
What's next? Driving the short bus?
Mona, you are terrible.
Hey, isn't that your mom?
Hanna?
Why? Why would you talk to Wilden?
Hanna--
You're not, like, into him, are you?
No. God, no.
Well then, what?
Why would you be in a car with him?
I'm looking for answers
because I can't get any from you.
What kind of answers?
The other day, when Mona was here,
I saw that shredded police report you had.
Yeah. So?
So where did it come from?
I don't know.
Clearly, someone is trying to use that to hurt you,
and me, so I gave it to Wilden.
Look, I don't like him any more than you do.
But if he can keep you safe--
No, giving that report to Wilden is the opposite of safe.
Mom, if that gets out--
It's already out.
It was on our kitchen counter.
Wilden has just as much at stake as we do.
He could lose his job, and, Hanna,
you don't always know what's best.
Yeah? Well if you went to wilden,
then neither do you.
Hanna.
Didn't dad tell you to start by shaving with the grain?
I'm still trying to find the grain.
I just thought I'd try while he was away, making a boy--
And taking pictures.
Yeah, no event too small to commemorate.
Are you still going to the dance?
Why?
Uh, well, Gavin asked me to lend a hand deejaying, so,
I could use a ride.
Yeah, well, better find some backup.
I'm not really feeling the whole father/daughter thing lately.
Well, I think you should go.
Yeah? Why?
Dad still thinks you're seeing Holden, right?
What makes you think that I'm not?
Did mom te--
She didn't have to.
I heard you guys when you came home last night.
If you don't go, he's just gonna get suspicious
that you're-- you're ducking out
to see your secret boyfriend all over again.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
You and Fitz being together,
it's caused a lot of problems, right?
Not just with you, but kind of with everybody.
I guess.
I'm not blaming you, I just-- I don't get it.
You and dad right now,
it's just the latest in a whole bunch of messy fights
and lies and bad feelings--
Mike.
What's your question?
If your relationship is so much trouble,
why not just let it go?
Seems impossible that things will ever work out.
Look, when you love someone,
it's worth fighting for no matter what the odds.
Dad, it's so great to see you.
I wish mom was here too.
Well, she may have felt like
a third wheel at a father/daughter dance.
She's got that charity run this weekend.
Yeah. I'm excited to call and find out her times.
Usually, it's the other way around.
Your mom's kicking herself for missing your swim team finals.
Yeah, it's no big deal.
Well, it actually kinda was.
Well, at least you have Maya in the stands cheering for you.
That's not a good look.
Wanna tell me what's going on?
Maya's gone.
I caught her doing something
that could get her in a lot of trouble.
Instead of listening, I jumped down her throat.
She said she was gonna crash
with some friends in San Francisco, so.
I guess that's where she is.
I just wish she'd call or text me or something
so I'd know for sure.
Her parents have no idea where she is?
Well, I know you would feel better if you had more information,
but it sounds to me like Maya wants to stay disconnected.
There's not a lot of ways that
someone your age can make it to California on their own.
We could check the bus station.
It's cheap, it's a great way to travel under the radar.
Hell, I made it to Albuquerque.
You ran away?
I put your grandparents through hell.
I was, uh, lost in high school.
How long were you gone for?
Oh, just a few days.
Long enough to scare'em.
Yeah, well, if that's what Maya intended to do,
it's definitely working.
Hey, come on.
Let's take a look around today, yeah?
See if we can put your mind at ease.
Who knows? Maybe Maya decides to come home faster
if she knows the people who care about her are still looking.
Hey, you up for a little round robin?
Meeting the Gibsons at the club.
Um, I would really love to, but I have to study.
You don't like it, do you? The necklace?
I should've let you pick something out.
No, dad, I do like it.
I get it. You need your space.
I miss having you out there on the court with me, you know?
We make such a great team.
Okay.
Oh, I made dinner reservations at Gianni's.
I know it's one of your favorites.
7:00 good?
Yeah, 7:00 is fine.
Okay.
Will you be gone long?
Um, for a couple hours.
Dad?
Oh, hey.
He's at the club.
I just needed a stamp.
Oh, I think I might actually have a stamp in my--
Oh. Got one.
I'll see if one of the ticket agents talked to Maya.
Who was working a couple nights ago?
Excuse me.
She can help you at the next station.
The guard said that you were working a couple of nights ago.
I was.
Do you remember seeing this girl?
Sorry.
If you could just tell me.
Sorry, miss.
I only have 20 minutes for lunch.
We're not gonna find anything here.
Hold on a second, sweetie.
Afternoon, sir.
You commissioned?
Fort Hood, Texas.
Honorable discharge, '75.
How can I help you?
My daughter has got some questions.
A friend of hers is lost.
Wanna see if we can bring her back home.
Can I see that picture again?
I did see your friend.
Bought a ticket to San Fran.
That's where she went.
Where she bought her ticket to.
What do you mean exactly?
Well, I saw her twice that night.
Once at the window,
then about an hour later,
I was checking a lady's bags. I saw her standing outside
talking to someone in a dark colored car.
Blue, maybe black.
Could you see who was driving?
Not really. I turned my back for a minute to load some bags.
When I looked back, both your friend and the car were gone.
Do you know if she got on the bus?
Can't say for sure.
Great. She could be anywhere.
Thanks for your help, sir.
My pleasure.
That looks nice.
Oh, your home.
Yeah, you picking something for tonight?
Yup. Trying to do my best.
Don't take too long.
I need lead time to make sure my tie matches.
Dad, we don't have to do that this year.
Why? What's different about this year?
Listen, Aria, I know that you and I
have had our problems lately.
But this is--
this is the father/daughter dance,
and I need to take my little girl.
So, is that too much to ask?
No, it's not.
I'm just gonna pick what I'm gonna wear.
Voice mailbox full.
Where are you going?
Out.
Hanna. Hanna.
You have one last chance to tell me about that police report.
I already told you.
What you want to tell me.
I'm asking you for the rest.
Who it came from?
And why?
You need to give me your phone.
What?
If you're not gonna give me any answers,
I'm gonna have to go looking for them myself.
Did Wilden ask you to--
No, this isn't about wilden, this is about you and me.
I am trying to help you.
Give it to me.
No.
Now.
Hanna. Hanna!
I'm outta here.
Your wearing your dress uniform.
Isn't that for special occasions?
And what's not special about tonight?
It would've been more special if I'd gotten ready on time.
Sort of got hung up at home. Maya called.
You talked to her. Is she all right?
She didn't leave a message.
I wanted to wait and see if she'd call back.
Well, at least you heard from her.
It's just so frustrating.
You made plans for us to hang out,
and all I wanted to do was look for Maya.
Now I'm starting to realize it.
Maybe she doesn't want to be found.
I just wish I hadn't wasted our time together.
How we spend the time doesn't matter.
I get to spend time with you.
I don't want you feeling guilty about that.
Emmie, I have to be truthful with you.
This may be the last weekend
we get to spend together for a while.
What do you mean?
They're sending you back.
Afghanistan.
Six months.
Does mom know?
She does.
Part of the reason why she stayed at home.
To pack up the house.
And she wanted to give us some quality time together.
When do you leave?
I'm on the last flight out tonight.
Deploy out of Texas tomorrow morning.
Come on.
You look beautiful.
Thanks.
Hey, later, let's make sure that we get a photograph, okay?
Of course.
You know, I remember the first time we danced like this.
You were so little, you had to stand on my shoes.
Yeah, that was a really long time ago, dad.
Yeah. I guess it was.
Listen, I'm going to get us something to drink, okay?
Yeah, that sounds good.
Okay.
Hanna, what's going on?
Where's your dress?
Where's your mom?
Hot on the "A" trail.
Um, what does that mean exactly?
It means she found the police report that "A" sent you.
And she thinks it was sent to me.
She gave it to Wilden.
Why?
Because she thinks it's a threat.
It is.
I don't know, she's just trying to keep us safe.
Yeah, but why Wilden?
Hanna, now your mom and my mom are both asking questions about "A."
And "A" really doesn't like that.
If they talk to each other--
Or if Wilden comes up with something?
What if they end up like--
Um, okay.
We need a creative solution.
Well, I have an idea.
Okay, Mona.
It's gonna require a really big lie and I'm terrible at that.
Which one of you girls is best at hiding the truth
from someone who's close to you?
Her.
Wow, really? Thanks, guys.
Okay, Mona, what's my lie?
Don't forget to smile.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
Slow dance is not your need?
Cause I can get the DJ to pump up the jams a little if you want.
No, really, come on.
Bust and move with your old man.
What do you say?
Spence, I'm really trying here.
A little bit too hard.
Wait, wait, Spencer.
Dad, you kept a huge secret from us.
And I don't want to do the same thing to you.
I went into your study today when you were at the club.
And you told me that you didn't pay Alison a cent.
Because I didn't.
Well, I found a check stub
that would suggest differently.
What check stub? Were you in my desk?
There was no date on it,
but I know it was written around the time
of Alison's disappearance.
Spencer
$15,000, dad.
Exactly the amount that Ali had stashed away.
Look, I know we have some trust issues right now.
But that didn't give you the right to go into my desk.
Can we not discuss this here?
I wanna go home.
Hey, just in time. It's almost our turn.
Yeah, about that.
Do you care if we leave the dance a little bit early?
Early? - Like now?
Um, Hanna really needs me.
I just saw Hanna. She looked fine.
Dad, please.
Um, can we at least get a photo first?
We've got one from--
Every year, you and your little girl.
I know, but you need to understand something.
I'm not your little girl anymore.
I'm sorry. But I'm not.
Toby?
Really amazing what they've done in here.
Almost forget I'm in a cafeteria.
Yeah, it's pretty.
Dad, why didn't you tell me right when you got here?
I couldn't, kiddo.
As much as I was worried about Maya, i could've handled it.
Look, I know you can handle it.
It was more for me..
I just needed this weekend.
To dance with you.
I have a confession to make.
Okay.
I know about tha police report you have.
And I know who sent it to Hanna.
You do?
Who?
Me.
You? Why?
I've known for a while now that Hanna's been shoplifting again.
I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you that.
Go on.
Well, Hanna wouldn't listen to me.
To any of us when we begged her to stop.
And I know that she's been caught before
and I--I was just afraid that if she got caught again,
she could end up in jail.
So, I sent her the report to frighten her.
To try and scare her straight.
How did you get it?
I made it up. Literally.
It's nice to know my photoshop class finally came in handy.
Well, that's quite a story.
And you're really the only person involved?
Yup.
I'm "A."
A for anonymous. A for Aria. A for--
I get it.
I'm-- I'm so sorry, Mrs. Marin.
I appreciate you speaking with me, Aria.
Yeah, well, if there a anything else you need me to do,
or if there's--
I think I'll take it from here.
What else did you touch in here?
Nothing.
Spencer, you said
you were in here today. Did you open this drawer?
No, it was locked.
Dad?
Yes, hi. I need to report a break in.
The house was locked up tight when we left,
but there's a gun missing from my desk.
Yes. No, um--
Nothing else appears to be stolen.
Just the gun.
You have a good time tonight?
Considering it was a father/daughter dance.
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
Oh, that's great.
Have you, um, have you seen your sister?
Not yet.
Okay. Well, good night.
Dad?
Do you think maybe you've been too hard on Aria?
Well, it sounds like you do.
I know that she didn't tell you the truth
about her and Mr. Fitz, but did she tell you why?
No.
Maybe because you didn't ask.
All right, thank you. See you soon.
Patrol car will be here shortly.
I gave those pictures to a private investigator.
for reference.
You had her followed.
The check stub you found today,
written to cash?
But I thought that--
I know what you thought.
You thought I paid Alison's blackmail.
And I lied to you.
Spencer, I hired a private investigator
to look into her disappearance.
Why would you spend that much money?
Why would you even care?
Because I thought someone very important to me might be involved.
You changed that will to give Jason an alibi.
Well, it's you protecting him.
Do you think Jason really had something to do with it?
No, Spencer. Not Jason.
I was worried about your sister.
Why?
Melissa was harassing Alison.
Sending her texts and threats.
And then your friend disappeared.
You don't think that Melissa--
I just needed peace of mind.
And I was willing to pay for answers.
That's the police.
I think you better go upstairs.
Spencer.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Why are the cops here?
I saw dad talking to them outside?
Dad's gun is missing.
He thinks that somebody broke in.
You didn't hear anybody, did you?
No. I fell asleep watching a show in the barn.
Lights woke me up a few minutes ago.
I thought that the TV outside is broken.
I don't know, I was watching it on my laptop.
Listen, I gotta go back into the city tonight.
After everything we talked about;
Jason, dad, the blackmail;
I don't think I can stay here.
I should get on the road.
But, listen, spencer,
if things start getting even weirder around here,
you can always come stay with me.
I want you to know, I'll keep you safe, okay?
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
I didn't buy it.
I appreciate that, but the fact that Aria would make this up.
They're all making things up.
Hiding something or someone.
Whoever this "A" person is
has got them completely terrified.
When I saw that police report, I was scared, too.
About a year ago when Byron and I were split up,
this "A" sent something to us too.
They knew things about our family.
What did you do?
Nothing, I mean, I didn't know what to do.
I do, I got the police involved.
I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
"A" knows things about Aria that could hurt her.
This has gone on for far too long.
We owe it to ourselves and our daughters
to get some answers.
Did my mom buy it?
I have no idea.
Do you feel guilty?
No. Yes.
I don't know.
Always a good sign.
Aria, what's wrong?
It's Jonah.
Well, answer it.
Hello?
Wait, Spence. Stop here.
I think this is the block.
Welcome to Brookhaven.
What did Jonah say to you exactly?
That Vivian Darkbloom's friend, Alison,
was receiving texts from more than one number.
Wait, so does this mean that
Melissa was telling Spencer the truth?
Just means that she's getting texts from more than one number.
So there was someone else. Like the real "A."
Spencer, you were right.
Where exactly are we headed?
I don't know.
Jonah said he couldn't find a
specific address or where the texts were coming from,
but that they originated somewhere
in a block radius from here.
Do we have any idea what we're supposed to be looking for?
Well, I'm looking for a new phone.
Guys.
My God.
1948年起出售/买进古董娃娃及玩具
Those look exactly like those creepy chucky dolls
that "A" sent us.
I'm freezing.
I've got something in the back of my car.
Thanks.
I used to like dolls.
I'm over it.
Me too.
Vivian?
