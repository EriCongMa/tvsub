sergeant korsak .
morning , jenkins .
guy just left this for you . bobby symanski .
korsak .
i &apos;ll be right there .
the temp m.e. is on his way .
deceased is judith barnett , 40 .
multiple stab wounds on her back .
weapon ?
two round blood smears on either side of her ,
so the killer was kneeling over her .
no sign of forced entry .
neighbor saw a white truck gunning away from the curb .
license plate ?
no .
and no description of the driver .
neighbor saw the open door ,
came in , found the body , called 911 .
what about relatives ?
the victim &apos;s husband , alan , is a dentist .
he &apos;s been with a patient , in surgery .
here &apos;s the address .
all right .
let us know what you turn up .
we &apos;ll go talk to alan .
dr. barnett should be finished any moment .
are you sure i can &apos;t help you , detectives ?
uh , no , thank you .
we really do need to speak to dr. barnett .
here you go , sweetie . thanks .
see you tomorrow .
oh , here he is .
you have someone coming to pick you up , right ?
my son -- sam .
excellent .
very good driver , sam .
i &apos;m sure .
good to see you , marion .
dr. barnett .
these detectives from the boston police
would like to speak with you .
oh . really ? why ?
what time did you leave the house this morning ?
6 : 15 . judith was asleep .
i met mrs. gold here at 6 : 30 .
and your receptionist can confirm that ?
what ?
no . she comes in at 8 : 00 .
i was alone with mrs. gold for the gum graft .
she needs extra attention .
i told jjudith that something like this might happen .
what do you mean ?
judith was big all her life --
as a girl , when i met her , when we got married .
and i loved her . just the way she was .
but she didn &apos;t love herself . she tried dieting . never worked .
then , a year ago , she found tough broad .
the workout .
she lost a hundred pounds .
and i was really worried for her .
could explain that for us ?
she was a grown woman who &apos;d never learned
how to deal with men &apos;s advances
because no one was ever interested .
most woman develop some kind of defenses as teenagers .
judith was getting a lot of attention from men .
she didn &apos;t know how to handle it .
excuse me .
frankie .
was there a specific man giving your wife attention ?
no , but ...
guys were starting conversations with her in the supermarket .
waiters were fawning over her .
the mailman hung around to chat .
okay . thanks .
did that bother you ?
me ? no .
i was proud .
i was the guy with this amazing wife .
was judith expecting anyone at your house this morning ?
our handyman .
he &apos;s been putting in new insulation .
and what is his name ?
luis benitez .
we &apos;ll be in touch , dr. barnett .
we are very sorry for your loss .
what &apos;s up ?
that call from frankie .
they found the knife used to stab judith .
it &apos;s got the initials &quot; l.b. &quot; carved into the handle .
let &apos;s have some uniforms bring luis benitez in for a chat .
let &apos;s .
he &apos;s got a long rap sheet .
multiple arrests for breaking and entering .
multiple incidents of assault with a deadly weapon .
wild guess on the weapon -- a knife .
wild and correct .
korsak .
he did so much work for the barnetts ,
they set up an account for him at factory hill hardware .
he bought locks a month ago .
so he &apos;d have a key .
could this get any easier ?
when the uniforms went to pick up luis , he was gone .
his mother said he went out of town --
took some clothes , left in a hurry .
so our guy &apos;s not ready to jump into cuffs just yet .
what &apos;s up , chang ?
jane !
uh , dr. crosby gave me
the initial findings from the crime scene .
well , why didn &apos;t he give them to me ?
oh , there &apos;s a reason why he works in a one @-@ man office in maine .
anyhoo ...
these are judith &apos;s wounds .
the length and the shape of the knife found at the scene
match the wound pattern .
the edges were serrated ,
which is why ribs were broken and bone was sawed off .
what about the blood on the knife ?
matches the victim .
no fibers or hair on the body that weren &apos;t hers .
so you think the killer snuck up behind her and stabbed her ?
i can &apos;t say .
well , take a guess .
i &apos;m a scientist .
so &apos;s maura . she does it .
i &apos;m not dr. isles .
i know that , but she &apos;s not here .
so , throw out a theory .
stretch your wings and grow .
it &apos;s your time to shine . whoo !
that &apos;s a mixed metaphor .
okay , see . there you go . that &apos;s very maura .
nope . okay .
* everything is different , though *
* and nothing has changed *
* walking these streets , i still feel strange *
* if you want to see the things i see *
* come on and take a little walk with me *
vince ?
* come on and take a little walk with me *
vince ?
* turn a corner , you &apos;re caught off guard *
* you thought you were tough *
oh , hey , angela .
hi .
* you thought you were hard *
who &apos;s that ?
bobby symanski , my friend peter &apos;s grandson .
he &apos;s good .
very .
i like that song .
his grandfather wrote it . we used to have a band .
wow . he must be proud .
* come on and take a little walk *
he &apos;s dead .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , it &apos;s a long time ago .
bobby dropped this off .
he &apos;s playing in boston .
that &apos;s great . you gonna go see him ?
he wants me to play with him .
vince , even better !
i don &apos;t play those songs anymore . it &apos;s not who i am .
you know , in one lifetime , we lead a lot of different lives .
well , that one &apos;s over .
if ... you want it to be .
tell jane i was looking for her .
sure thing .
luis was an almost constant presence
at the house the last year .
so he witnessed judith &apos;s total transformation .
hi !
hold on .
no more shots for carla .
i &apos;m not driving !
more shots for carla !
continue .
well , they spent a lot of time together .
uh , maybe that allowed luis to think
there was something more going on than her just being nice .
what is going on in your room ?
i &apos;ve turned it into a hospitality suite with an open bar .
ah ! good job , gary !
he hit the bull &apos;s @-@ eye . great .
well , it looks like you &apos;re having fun .
jane , it &apos;s a nightmare .
carla is out of control , and they &apos;ve wrecked my room .
and now they think i &apos;m this crazy party person .
you &apos;re not ?
look , don &apos;t do anything that makes you uncomfortable , all right ?
just be yourself .
right . absolutely . good advice .
dr. isles ! we &apos;re dry over here !
well , give me that bottle of rye ,
and i &apos;ll show you how to make a dr. pecker !
hey , frankie .
uniforms spotted luis &apos; car in the south end .
okay . where are you ?
in an alleyway near the corner of mass and columbus .
there he is , jane . i got to go .
he &apos;s coming out the back .
move . move !
freeze ! boston police !
put your hands on the car .
get your hands on the car !
didn &apos;t you learn anything the last time you got arrested , luis ?
don &apos;t run .
makes you look guilty .
tell us what happened yesterday morning .
i showed up for work at the barnetts &apos; .
i knocked on the door .
no one answered . so i used my key .
i walked around , and i found mrs. barnett .
but i didn &apos;t do it .
then why did you run ?
because i &apos;ve got a record . because i know how it looks .
&apos;cause no one believes an ex @-@ con .
do you have your initials on all your tools ?
no , just my knife .
to remind me that what &apos;s used for evil
can also be used for good .
and where is that knife now ?
i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t find it .
you &apos;ve got multiple priors for robbery ,
breaking and entering , three separate stabbings .
all that time in the house with judith .
you must have thought that could go somewhere .
so you made a move on her .
and when she refused , you got mad .
that could have happened .
it did happen .
no . but it could have .
i had no self @-@ control .
when i got out of prison the last time ,
even moms told me she wasn &apos;t gonna be there for me ,
that i had shamed her , that i ...
that i had shamed god .
and i heard her .
i went back to our church . i went to a.a.
moms gave me my room back ,
and i moved in so she could see i was trying .
and i changed .
well , judith was changing , too .
that must have been attractive to you .
yes .
yes , it was .
i @-@ i ...
she became a different person .
s @-@ s @-@ she ...
it gave me hope .
i told her so .
she inspired me .
padre nuestro , que estas en el ciel .
what does your gut tell you ?
we need evidence .
he knew the victim . he was in her house .
the murder weapon belonged to him .
what about motive ?
i can think of 10 .
me , too , but none of them feel right .
we &apos;ve got no witnesses
and nothing but the knife to tie him to the murder .
what do you want to do ?
give me five minutes .
susie !
i was , uh , just coming to talk to you .
oh , i &apos;m not there . i &apos;m here . to show you how i shine .
okay . great .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s my theory .
your theory &apos;s in a box ?
it &apos;s a &quot; die @-@ o @-@ rama . &quot;
oh . d @-@ i @-@ e.
yes .
... for dead people .
well , not all of them are dead ,
but it &apos;s a representation of how they got to be .
it &apos;s amazing .
yes .
and the killer is wearing a tyvek suit .
yes .
because there was no forensic evidence
found at the crime scene ,
which means the killer was wearing
some sort of protective outerwear .
the handyman had tyvek suits in his truck .
yes .
you made all this just to tell me that ?
no , i made this to figure it out .
i &apos;m a visual thinker .
well ... it &apos;s fantastic .
really . susie , thank you . we got him .
except the handyman didn &apos;t do it .
okay , but you said --
the handyman &apos;s too tall to make the stab wounds
at the angle of entry they were made on judith &apos;s body .
see , this killer is to scale ,
but your suspect would not be to scale .
but the tyvek suit --
he uses them a lot . maybe someone knew that .
you just guessed .
i theorized .
you guessed . no , no . you guessed .
that was a guess . that was ...
you don &apos;t use these things to illustrate stuff
in your personal life , right ?
uh ... okay .
luis , you spent a lot of time at the barnett house .
did you ever see anything unusual ?
mostly mrs. barnett was alone .
the only person that came by was the tough broad guy .
mickey rizzo .
yeah , the boxer .
he was over all the time -- private coaching .
they always closed the door .
we talked to luis benitez &apos;s parole officer ,
his a.a. sponsor , his mother ,
his bible @-@ studies group .
they all tell the same story -- he &apos;s a changed man .
the knife wounds are precise and deliberate .
not what you &apos;d expect from an ex @-@ con with anger issues .
and susie says he &apos;s not to scale .
what ?
we &apos;ll talk about susie when you get back . hey .
i think it &apos;s time we go meet the man
who turned judith into a tough broad .
i &apos;ve got another lead to pursue .
take frankie .
sure . you okay ?
great .
did you get a chance to go over those case files i sent you ?
jane , you shouldnt have sent these .
it &apos;s a serious violation of protocol .
this is dr. crosby &apos;s case .
he &apos;s the only one authorizd to release these files .
well , i didn &apos;t want to bother him . he was too busy going slow .
well , this makes me very uncomfortabl .
just take a look , please . see if you see anything .
come on , maura ! we &apos;re playing &quot; autopsy jeopardy ! &quot;
well , i see you &apos;ve turned it back into your kind of convention .
oh , yeah . last night was a bit much .
carla threw my toilet seat out the window .
one game , and then we &apos;re watching my slide show .
oh , no , don &apos;t do that to the --
hey , vince !
this thing is huge !
if maura ever kicks me out , i &apos;m gonna move right in .
what &apos;s that ?
my old guitar ,
from when i played with bobby &apos;s grandfather .
i &apos;m gonna give it to bobby .
that &apos;s nice . it &apos;s not what he wants .
yeah , but it &apos;s family history .
history is for old people .
well , what do you think he wants ?
come on , vince .
you &apos;re smarter than that . think about it .
bye !
bye @-@ bye .
how well do you know judith barnett ?
very well . she joined the gym a year ago .
hey , what she did with her body
took a lot of work and a lot of time .
you gave her a lot of personal attention ,
make her feel special .
i mean , yeah . that &apos;s a big part of my job .
really ? - look , these women --
they don &apos;t get a lot of attention from their husbands .
they come here to feel better about themselves .
and if part of that &apos;s me flirting with them ,
well , hey , that &apos;s good for business .
you ever go to her house ?
i set up her gym .
are we gonna find your dna in her bedroom ?
why are you asking about dna ?
were you having an affair with judith barnett ?
no . look . you know what ? judy was a client .
where were you yesterday morning between 7 : 00 and 9 : 00 ?
asleep .
alone ?
you know what ?
i &apos;m not gonna answer any more questions , all right ?
okay .
we &apos;re gonna need a list of your clients and your investors .
and we &apos;ll let them answer the questions .
hey , you know what ? i &apos;m the pride of east boston , all right ?
i &apos;m golden gloves in two weight classes .
that &apos;s great , but it does--
hey , you know , it &apos;s taken me years
to build this business and gain these women &apos;s trust .
you were alone when she was murdered .
that doesn &apos;t help you .
you see how this looks , mickey ?
all right , look . i wasn &apos;t alone .
what &apos;s her name ?
this could ruin me .
prison will ruin you .
look , you got it all wrong . it &apos;s not like that .
i mean , these women here , they &apos;re all great , but ...
i &apos;m gay .
it would kill my business if it got out .
all right . all right . it won &apos;t get out .
thank you .
yeah .
look , judy wasn &apos;t doing anything with anyone .
she spent all her time working out .
but this dentist , he just ...
i don &apos;t know . he lost interest in her .
did she talk to her husband about this ?
for sure , she did .
she invited him to come down here ,
see what this place was all about , but he never came .
you know , she thought they &apos;d work out together
once they got the gym in the house , but he never did .
all he did was go to his old cabin every weekend
and leave a beautiful woman at home , alone .
thanks , mickey .
we &apos;ll let you know if we need anything else .
well , he was doing something .
or someone .
it &apos;s not exactly something a married man
leaves out in the open when he &apos;s cheating .
one toothbrush , a can of shaving cream ,
a single disposable razor .
no sign of another person being here , let alone a woman .
yeah , same thing here --
a couple of single @-@ serve frozen dinners from the trash ,
water bottles .
he wasn &apos;t here to fish , either .
no poles , no tackle , no boat .
well , so what ?
he comes up here to get away from it all
and practice his dentistry skills ?
something you should see outside .
is alan opening a fruit stand ?
it &apos;s not a great location .
better be some interesting garbage .
i think it &apos;s a bullet hole .
i think alan used these for target practice .
so what ? the victim was stabbed .
i know it doesn &apos;t make any sense , but ...
no . you &apos;re right . it &apos;s crazy .
alan &apos;s amazing wife is waiting at home
and he &apos;s out here in woodlandia ,
playing with his dental tools and shooting at watermelons ?
why ? there &apos;s got to be more to it .
let &apos;s get all this back to the crime lab ,
have susie take a look at it .
yep .
did you find anything yet ? what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s not watermelon , but it came from inside of one .
the broken watermelons all have it .
well , can you take your best guess ? chalk ?
i shouldn &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
jane , susie has been trained not to guess .
really ?
well , can she tell me what made these holes ?
circumferentially , they &apos;re the same dimension as a .22 @-@ caliber bullet .
jane , it took you one whole day
to corrupt senior criminalist chang .
i &apos;m so sorry , dr. isles .
detective rizzoli means well ,
but you cannot let her impatience
influence your methodology .
you forgot to activate the cone of silence .
well , can we at least talk about ...
whatever it is you two are doing here ?
susie &apos;s pursuing an interesting line of inquiry ,
a forensic examination of the victims .
&quot; victims &quot; ? what -- what victims ?
those aren &apos;t victims . those are watermelons .
i am conducting a &quot; fruit @-@ opsy . &quot;
that &apos;s funny .
hilarious . i &apos;ll check in later .
i &apos;m going to go get a sus @-@ ictionary .
there you go .
hey , vince .
hey , angela .
well , you can keep it from me , vince ,
but you can &apos;t keep it from yourself .
it &apos;s a lot more complicated
than the loss of an old friend , angela .
complications . secrets . pain . happiness .
they &apos;re all the spices in the soup .
you leave one out , it doesn &apos;t taste as good .
peter &amp; vince .
we had a meeting with an a &amp; r record guy from new york .
he took us out on the town . he wined us . he dined us .
at the end of the night , peter wanted to go home .
he wanted to see his wife and kid .
but not me . i was flying .
i didn &apos;t want that night to end .
i let him walk home alone , drunk .
he took a shortcut across some railroad tracks .
he fell . he hit his head .
never woke up .
it snowed that night .
took a couple of days to find his body .
so ... how do i tell bobby i killed his grandfather ?
oh , come on , vince . you know that &apos;s not true .
well , i should have --
no , this is not about you , my friend .
this is about bobby .
it &apos;s about what he wants , what only you can give him .
what the hell could i possibly give bobby ?
how about a little piece of his grandfather ?
because he &apos;s still alive here in your heart .
detective rizzoli , i have the lab report .
and another box .
it &apos;s my findings from the fruit @-@ opsy .
they &apos;re a little hard to explain ,
so i did the only logical thing .
you made another die @-@ o @-@ rama .
to scale .
okay , well , frankie said that he thought the watermelons
were being used for target practice .
i agree .
the bullet traveled through and through this one .
the projectile struck the back wall of the watermelon
and tore out a chunk .
but in that watermelon , the bullet didn &apos;t come out .
there were no bullets in the watermelons .
could you have missed them ?
oh , no , the external examination of the subjects
showed no other means of exit .
and the x @-@ rays were negative for any foreign bodies within .
e @-@ except ...
except what ?
nothing .
maura &apos;s not here .
that stuff i found was dental plaster .
it &apos;s made from gypsum .
and it was different in each watermelon .
almost as if they came from different batches .
he was trying to make a bullet
that couldn &apos;t be detected in an autopsy .
he was ?
well , of course he was , susie .
everyone knows the die @-@ o @-@ rama doesn &apos;t lie .
i &apos;ll be careful .
oh , no ! aah !
i should have wrote &quot; handle with care &quot; on that one .
alan was trying to make a bullet out of dental plaster ,
something that would break apart once it entered judith &apos;s body .
is that even possible ?
air marshals use bullets that won &apos;t pass through a body
and hurt an innocent passenger
or damage the structure of the plane .
is that susie &apos;s die @-@ o @-@ rama ?
it &apos;s very realistic . and to scale , and the detail ...
focus , maura .
well , i just think that detailed work deserves appreciation .
okay .
the plaster bullet that did this
was too hard .
it went all the way through , and it didn &apos;t break apart .
so he mixed and remixed the plaster .
that would explain all the broken @-@ up watermelons
in the compost bin .
that &apos;s right .
until he found the perfect formula .
maximum damage with no exit wound .
and there &apos;d be no ballistics .
i &apos;d like to remind everyone , again ,
that judith barnett was stabbed to death .
i &apos;m not so sure of that .
i mean , there &apos;s something about the nature of the knife wounds
that &apos;s been bothering me .
frankie , can you pull up the x @-@ rays ?
see , this wound is narrow
and it &apos;s not as deep as the surrounding damage .
is that a fragment from the dental plaster ?
no , according to the autopsy report ,
it &apos;s a bone fragment that penetrated the pericardium .
it broke off .
that &apos;s what happens when you are stabbed .
yes , she was stabbed .
but the wound track here is too narrow .
that bone fragment was not driven into the wound by the knife .
jane , i &apos;d like susie to examine
the bone fragments from the wounds .
okay , and i want her to test
judith &apos;s clothes for gunshot residue .
why would he shoot her first and then stab her ?
because if alan snuck up on this woman with a knife
and she caught him , she &apos;d kick his ass .
if alan wanted to make a dental @-@ plaster bullet ,
he &apos;d need two things --
he &apos;d need a gun and something to make a cartridge .
well , the holes in the watermelons
were the size of a .22 @-@ caliber .
i borrowed some from ballistics .
he &apos;d need to pull out the lead bullet from the casing
and then replace it with the one he made .
he spent a lot of time pulling teeth with these things .
i believe he could take ... a bullet out of a cartridge .
well , that was easy enough .
no gun license in massachusetts
or anywhere else for alan barnett .
none for judith , either .
so , how the hell did he get a gun ?
i don &apos;t see alan barnett going out and making a street buy .
he didn &apos;t have to .
this is a crime @-@ scene photo of the cabin .
i had that part blown up .
young alan barnett had a ruger bearcat , .22 caliber .
good little squirrel gun .
i know dr. crosby says death by stabbing .
he &apos;s not maura .
what have you got ?
hi , detective rizzoli .
i was just about to give my results to dr. isles .
well , you have done a wonderful job
of not guessing and preserving your scientific mythology .
thank you .
it &apos;s methodology , jane .
i say tomato , you say &quot; tomaht @-@ ology &quot;
what have we got ? gsr on the clothes ?
susie , would you describe for us
what you &apos;re seeing in the microscope ?
yes , of course , dr. isles .
there are no bone @-@ growing cells
or proteins present in these bone fragments .
these bone fragments are from cadaver bone ,
not your victim &apos;s ribs .
the bone fragments have to be part of the bullet
that alan made .
it &apos;s brilliant , really .
i mean , all he had to do was add pieces of cadaver bone
to the dental plaster before it hardened .
he created the perfect delivery system .
and the knife wounds were meant to splinter the ribs
to hide the cadaver bone in the wound tracks .
and to set up the handyman .
alan used luis &apos; knife . he knew he had a record .
it &apos;s a great plan , actually .
except for the one part that doesn &apos;t make sense .
why would a happily married man kill his wife
after she lost a hundred pounds ?
&apos;cause he liked her just the way she was .
when he was the only man who paid her any attention .
thanks .
trace evidence section found gunshot residue
on judith barnett &apos;s crop top .
jane , this changes everything .
now i need to notify dr. crosby of my findings .
although the stab wounds are significant injuries ,
given what i know now ,
i &apos;m revising my initial cause of death to gunshot wound .
it &apos;s time we had a talk with alan barnett .
thank you for coming in .
i know you must be very busy with your wife &apos;s arrangements .
detective rizzoli and i are very sorry for your loss .
thank you .
it has been very hard on me .
she was my friend , my partner , my lover .
she was everything to me .
you two must have had a great life together --
travel , restaurants , weekends at the cabin .
did you go fishing up there ? hiking ?
no . not much .
no .
no , you wouldn &apos;t have .
no , you &apos;d rather watch hiking on your tv .
in your big , soft chair , with judith right next to you .
that &apos;s what we enjoyed .
yeah , but she stopped enjoying it , didn &apos;t she ?
then she joined tough broad , got in shape , lost the weight ,
and good @-@ looking men started paying attention to her .
big , strong men .
men like luis and mickey .
of course .
she looked great .
and that made you happy .
it made her happy .
that &apos;s what we want for our loved ones .
what a generous little man you are .
well , considering that your wife
started a new life that you were no longer a part of .
my wife loved me .
she would never leave me .
you were watching tv alone .
going to the cabin alone .
you two no longer had anything in common
because she &apos;d already left .
no ! i would never have allowed ...
am i being placed under arrest ?
you &apos;re free to go , dr. barnett .
of course i am .
because you have a theory but no evidence .
i &apos;m not much of a fisherman . neither are you .
you &apos;ve got nothing .
and that &apos;s all you &apos;ll ever have .
he thinks he &apos;s smarter than us .
maybe he is .
bullshit .
where &apos;s frankie ?
we &apos;re meeting him in break . you got something ?
yeah .
i had susie take a blood sample from the patient that alan was with
the morning of his wife &apos;s murder .
ketamine ? the animal tranquilizer ?
according to maura , dentists use it .
but an elderly patient like mrs. gold
should be administered a very low dose .
she had a detectable level of ketamine still in her system .
48 hours after her surgery .
mrs. gold was really out of it when we saw her .
yeah , he knocked her out
and gave himself the perfect window of opportunity .
strike one .
i found the best route from alan &apos;s office to his house .
no traffic cameras , no homeland security cameras .
15 minutes each way .
okay .
so , the handyman was scheduled to arrive at alan &apos;s house
while he was performing the gum graft .
but judith had to be dead by then for the plan to work .
but she couldn &apos;t have been killed before he left for work
or that would skew the time of death .
the receptionist said alan was in with mrs . gold
when she got there at 8 : 00 .
her appointment was 6 : 30 .
so , he worked on mrs. gold ,
made sure she was completely anesthetized ,
left at 7 : 00 ?
this is me on the route to his house .
he gets there at 7 : 15 .
pulls on a tyvek suit , gloves and a mask ,
shoots judith before she can kick his ass ,
and then stabs her with the knife
that he stole from the handyman .
he drops the knife for us to find ,
takes off the tyvek suit , heads for the office .
7 : 40 ?
yeah , but he &apos;s still got to get rid of the gun
and the bloody tyvek suit .
i had some uniforms look through all the dumpsters
and trash barrels .
public works searched the storm drains and sewers .
nothing .
yeah , he &apos;s too smart to leave anything close to the crime scene .
i know where alan got rid of the gun and the tyvek suit .
strike two !
thank you .
i &apos;ll take that .
you can &apos;t just -- - we called your courier service .
they said you were expecting a delivery .
you have no right .
this gives us that right .
you absolutely , positively have to have it overnight .
which you did .
ruger , bearcat , .22 caliber .
it was a slick move ,
mailing yourself the only evidence
that &apos;ll tie you to your wife &apos;s murder .
all you had to do was throw the gun in the nearest lake
and burn the tyvek suit in the woods .
pretty smart .
but not smart enough . strike three .
at least i &apos;m to scale .
you are so , so not to scale .
look at those things on your chest .
those things are perfect in form and balance .
look at you . you &apos;re all leg .
well , i &apos;m exactly to scale
because , you know , susie doesn &apos;t guess .
well , she does now .
ooh , here she comes .
hello , senior criminalist chang .
very nice to see you , susie .
dr. isles , detective .
you both look nice tonight .
what ? did -- she didn &apos;t even notice .
you had your right arm up a bit more .
i was not .
you weren &apos;t -- you weren &apos;t bending your foot right .
i don &apos;t bend my feet .
objects in the die @-@ o @-@ rama appear bigger than they are .
well , hers .
which ones ?
general comment .
angela talked to you .
yeah . that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
me too .
i was thinking , when i go to next year &apos;s convention ,
you should come with me .
will they have &quot; autopsy jeopardy &quot; ?
yeah .
then i &apos;m gonna schedule surgery for that weekend .
hey , look who &apos;s back in town .
hi , honey .
hi , ma . mwah .
hey , aren &apos;t you two a little too old to be playing with dolls ?
what ? we brought them for frankie .
oh , you &apos;re a riot , janie .
hello , boston !
hello .
uh , tonight &apos;s a very special night .
i &apos;m gonna do some songs my grandfather wrote ,
the way they were meant to be sung
and the way they were meant to be played .
ladies and gentlemen , i am bobby .
i &apos;m vince .
all right .
and tonight , we are bobby &amp; vince .
thanks .
