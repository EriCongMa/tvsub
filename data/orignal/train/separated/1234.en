So you lied and told me Charlie wasn't real.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
Lesli Stone was in Radley.
Long enough to know Mona and Charles.
Lesli's not pretending to be Charles.
She'd only heard Charles' name once.
The night that Bethany snuck out of Radley and never came back.
Charles snuck out that night too.
If you keep this up, I will take you
far away from here, I mean it.
You're gonna bury me at Aunt Carol's farm too
right next to Charles?
Sara was pretty and poised and perfect.
And everything she gave you
she took two things away.
I wished Sara was dead before she disappeared.
Maybe you could sell me something
that would help calm my nerves.
Yeah. What?
Pot. Maybe some brownies.
It's not just the junkyard,
I-it's the bottle of hair color in the dark room,
the text in Sullivan's office.
How did A know we were all gonna be there
at the exact same time?
Bitch chipped us.
Hi, this is Alison.
I'm not available to take your call.
Please leave me a message.
You find anything?
Yeah.
Most microchips are about the size of a grain of rice
and all they contain is an ID number, but..
...ours feels bigger.
It's like A modified it
so that he could track our every move.
Oh, my God! What is that?
Somebody removing their dog's microchip.
We're gonna have to get it out somehow.
Yeah, on second thought, maybe we should just keep ours in.
Maybe we should.
Spencer, I was joking.
No, I'm not.
A doesn't know that we know he's tracking us.
That's the only edge that we have over Charles.
And we have to figure out a way to use it.
That's your phone.
Is it Ali?
Mona.
We're on for tomorrow morning.
Lesli finally agreed to talk to us.
Okay, Ali has to be there. Charles is her brother.
She needs to know he's alive.
Yeah.
And anything else that Lesli can tell us.
She might know who A is.
And not just a name, but his face.
Hi, this is Alison.
I'm not available to take your call..
Where the hell is she?
Dad, please, you have to tell me what's going on.
Where were you just now?
Where are you taking me?
Some place safe.
He's alive.
And he's coming for us, isn't he?
第六季 第七集
Oh, good, you're up.
Yeah.
Um, I was just gonna go to The Brew and pick up
some muffins for you and Caleb and surprise you.
I actually have a surprise for you instead.
Go ahead. Open it.
Thirty thousand dollars?
It's your tuition, Hanna.
I promised you I would figure out how to pay for college.
Didn't I?
Mom, eh, how did you..
While you were gone I, um, I applied to every scholarship
I could find and-and, um..
You know, it helped planning for your future
and believing you still had one.
I can't believe it. I mean, one of the applications
actually paid off, literally.
Wait. "The Carissimi Group."
Why does that sound familiar?
They probably sponsored a hospital wing or something.
Jason recommended it. He said his mom donated all the time.
Well, you at least owe me a hug.
Seriously getting worried over here, Ali.
And we need to talk. Can you just call me back?
Emily?
It's Claire, Sara's friend. We met.
Yeah. Yeah, I remember.
That girl, Sabrina told me
that you weren't working here anymore.
I was just about to leave.
Y-you were looking for me?
And Sara.
I-I went by her mom's a few times
but she wouldn't tell me where she was.
At least not right away.
Is Sara--
No.
No, I just dropped her off at work.
Work? Sara's got a job?
That's great.
God, if I went through what she did, I don't think
I'd remember how to read, never mind be able to--
We all remember how to read.
No, I mean, that..
I'm sorry. I don't know the right thing to say here.
Of course not. No one does.
Look, Sara and I had some hard times.
But she was my friend.
No one deserved what you guys went through.
I just wanna see her.
You still have the same number? I can tell her to call you.
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah.
Uh, wait.
Sara's not at work right now.
She's at therapy, and I pick her up in two hours.
Hey, you're back.
I was actually just leaving.
Oh, oh. Change your plans.
I can't.
Wait. What's going on? Is your mom home?
No. No, she's still in Philly. I just.. You have to go.
I'm sor..
I'm sorry. You really have to go.
I haven't seen you in days.
I know.
And I really wanna catch up
and I wanna hear all about your police seminar.
Maybe tonight?
Hmm. I'm working.
Spence, what's going on?
Hmm? Nothing.
Did something happen when I was out of town?
No. Nothing. No..
I decided that I was gonna write the valedictorian speech
and Aria offered to help me
so she's waiting on me right now.
We don't do secrets. You and me.
We tried that before Tanner knew about A
and...we practically fell apart.
I just don't wanna go back to that.
Neither do I, okay?
I'll call you later.
Bye.
You promised she'd be here.
That's what she told me.
Call her again. Sorry, this doll's freaking me out.
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Lesli?
Probably got eaten by one of her rats.
Aria.
What?
Leave the doll alone.
Oh, Lesli just texted me.
She said she's made a lot of progress with her stability
and she thinks that this sort of confrontation
might set her back.
Unbelievable!
Tell her to get her ass over here
or I'll show her a confrontation.
Come on. Field trip.
Lesli knows who Charles is,
and you know where that bitch lives. Let's go.
No one's going anywhere. Lesli isn't lying.
That girl is one lost marble away from a major breakdown.
Look, I-I swear, Lesli doesn't know anything else.
If she did, she would tell me, and I would tell you.
The night that Bethany and Charles escaped from Radley
you were with Alison.
Ali told us. You picked her up on the side of the road.
You took her to the Lost Woods.
So maybe you saw somebody.
Some guy who could have been Charles.
I wish that I did, but no, I didn't see anybody else.
What about at Radley?
Someone you talked to stole the A game from you
while you were there. That is what you said.
I-I know I did, but I was on so many drugs.
I didn't even know who I was talking to.
I mean, half the time, I thought I was
being haunted by Ali, the other half of the time
I thought I was auditioning for "American Idol."
You don't have to see her if you're not ready.
There's no rush.
No, I want to.
I... just don't even know what we'd say.
It's been so long.
I can come with you if you want.
Act as a buffer, so it doesn't get weird.
There's actually this really cute dessert place
halfway from here to Courtland.
We could meet her there. It's nice and chill.
Okay.
H-how is therapy--
Did we--
Sorry. You go.
No. You talk.
If-if you want.
Last night, uh,
I'm not sure whether I dreamed somethin' or..
...it actually happened.
Oh, it happened.
Um, unless you want it to be a dream.
Then we can pretend.
No.
Please.
I've had enough pretend kisses.
This was my first real kiss in three years and...
I can't believe I was half asleep for it.
There will be more.
I mean, with other people. I mean, not..
Okay, um...
what I'm trying to say is
we've both been through a lot
and... we should probably take the time
and think about what we want.
Yeah, um...
you're probably right.
Lorenzo.
Everything okay?
I hope so.
Is Ali here?
Uh, no.
No, she's out of town with my dad. He told Tanner.
Do you know when she'll be back?
I'm not sure. Sorry.
I tried callin' her a couple of times.
She usually calls me back right away.
I didn't know you two had a usually.
Can you let her know I stopped by?
Will do.
And you can tell your guys to take off.
Ali won't be back for a couple of days.
I thought you didn't know when she'd be back.
I don't.
Oh. Sorry. Didn't see you there.
Getting rid of all these?
Oh, Picasso had his blue phase.
I had a doll phase. Time to find a new subject.
Why?
You're the one who said all my photos were creepy.
Well, I... I mean, creepy in a good way.
Yeah. Well, they're officially starting to creep me out, so..
I take it you didn't get into that art show?
I don't know yet.
But even if I did, it is still time to find
something new to photograph.
Hey! What's going on with you?
You've been pacing outside my room for, like, an hour.
Did you tell Mona not to call me?
What? No.
Did she tell you that?
That would require her actually talking to me.
So no.
What are you saying?
Aria, I haven't talked to her or seen her
since you guys were rescued.
Oh, my God. You're kidding.
No, I left a hundred messages.
I-I stopped by her house. I talked to her mom.
She doesn't wanna see me.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because I thought maybe you were the reason.
I'm not.
Mike, I swear.
So what should I do?
Sara ordered the peanut butter.
Oh! I just figured we'd all share.
You don't mind?
No.
I have, like, a thousand--
This place okay?
Shoot.
Uh, okay.
How's Avery? How's Tina?
How's Monkey?
Who's Monkey?
My dog, who's so not a puppy anymore.
Oh, he's huge!
He's like a person.
He thinks he's a person.
Wait. So you just left?
Yeah.
I couldn't just stand there and keep on lying to his face.
I mean, Toby knows me.
He knows I'm not just sitting on my hands
waiting for Tanner to figure this out.
He's right, Hanna.
We are exactly where we were two months ago.
Yeah, except now we have hardware in our necks.
God, we're like Cyclops.
Cyborgs.
I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Cyclops.
God, that's weird.
What?
That scholarship I got from The Carissimi Group
it's not listed on any of the usual websites.
And their homepage looks like
it's some sort of an investment firm.
战略投资以及实现盈利结果的领导能力
Just try that community tab.
Doesn't say anything about a scholarship.
Hanna.
Wait, that's where I saw this name before.
In Radley.
I don't get it.
Why would the people who paid to shut down Radley
pay for my tuition?
Oh, my God. You don't know about Lexi.
She's a mama bird.
Joe?
Nobody knows.
We, uh, we'd have to head back.
Check in with my mom.
Yeah, we should get the bill.
My parents wanna have you over for dinner.
Maybe tomorrow? Or tonight.
That...that'd be great.
I mean, you could sleep over, maybe stay a few days.
Or as long as you want. We have that extra room--
Sara has a place to stay and police protection at my house.
It's safer there.
I also don't think Lieutenant Tanner wants you
outside Rosewood.
Well, just think about it.
We've got a lotta Reese Witherspoon movies
to catch up on.
I will. Thanks.
Beloved.
What?
That's what carissimi means in Latin. Beloved.
As in, Charles, beloved son?
You said that Jason told your mom about this scholarship?
What if Mrs. D's favorite charity
was also her oldest son's bank account?
The owner has to be listed here somewhere.
Hello?
I.. I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
Who is this?
Where's Spencer?
Uh, she's on the phone.
She'll be right back.
Tell her to thank me later.
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Ali?
I'm at a hotel.
My dad drove me in the middle of the night.
He hid my cell phone, his car keys.
I'm stuck here.
Ali, I need to tell you something.
Charles is alive.
He threatened my dad.
He said he's coming home for his birthday.
His birthday?
Today, Spencer.
My dad called Jason and begged him to leave the house.
But he's determined to see Charles
no matter how dangerous it is.
Okay, and your dad didn't think to tell any of us?
Charles isn't after you.
Not this time.
But if Jason tries to meet him..
Alison.
Just one minute, dad.
Where's my phone? Did you take my phone?
Whoever you're talking to, you hang up now!
Ali?
I've got to go.
Please, talk to Jason and be careful.
I know you're trying to protect me, but what about Jason?
What about my friends? We have to tell someone.
Tell the police.
Tell them what?
That I lied about my son for two decades?
That I thought he was dead and I was wrong?
Will you just give me one day
just one day to figure things out?
Emily.
That was Claire.
Her dad's gonna pick me up in a couple hours.
What? Why?
Because it's the right thing to do.
I've put you and your mom out for so long.
No, you haven't. You know that.
Look, I didn't wanna say anything
but I've met Claire once before.
And she didn't have the nicest things to say about you.
I'm just not sure that...
She told me.
Just now.
Honestly, Emily,
I didn't like me that much back then either.
A-are you sure about this?
You don't look sure.
I've been thinking about what you told me earlier.
About what I want.
If we're not living together, we can go on a real date.
Maybe eat a meal your mom hasn't made for us.
And isn't chaperoning.
That would make it easier...to do this.
Open up! Jason, come on.
We know you're in there!
Jason, just talk to us, please.
Maybe he's not home.
But his car's right there.
He knows why we're here.
His dad already tried to get him to leave.
You mean Ali's prison guard.
Everything okay over there?
Yeah. We're fine.
Hey, have you seen Jason?
Looks like he doesn't wanna be bothered right now.
Anything we can help you with?
No, thank you.
What are you doing here?
I convinced your mom to let me in.
I-I-I brought you something.
From Aria, actually.
I don't wanna see you. You should leave.
Why?
I-I thought you were dead, Mona.
I covered for you. I did everything that you asked.
I know. That's the point, Mike.
I know what I put you through.
You begged me not to go through with it.
You stood in this room and fought with me for days
and I still did it.
You thought you had to.
And I was wrong.
Everything we went through, it was all for nothing.
Hell is a very lonely hole in A's dollhouse
and maybe I deserved to be there.
What you did was incredibly stupid.
And yeah, I'm pissed as hell at you.
But that doesn't matter.
Yes, it does.
It matters.
Not to me.
Not now.
All that matters is that you're alive.
Look at me, Mona.
So you think Jason's gonna meet Charles somewhere tonight?
Well, A's not gonna show up to Ali's house
with all those cops out front, so it's probably gonna be
so place outside of Rosewood.
I put one of Caleb's GPS trackers on Jason's car.
So the second he moves, we can follow him to A.
Follow him? We're being tracked too, remember?
Charles will know we're onto him.
That's why we have to remove our chips and leave them behind.
Our phones, anything that A could be monitoring.
Charles has to think he's in the clear.
We can't ambush A.
Charles has everything but superpowers.
Hey, guys, listen to me.
This has to be some sort of a trap.
A is always one step ahead of us.
Emily's right.
Ali asked you to keep Jason safe
not to get us all kidnapped again.
We need to take this to the police
and just step back from it.
The second this goes over
the police radio or an e-mail
A is gonna know he's being followed
and he's never gonna show up.
Well, that's fine by me.
I don't want him anywhere near us.
Wait, so we're just supposed to give up?
Let Charles keep owning our lives
and keep lying to the one's that we love?
I'm not gonna live like that.
We'll tell Toby.
He's got a badge and a gun. He can keep us safe.
We can follow Jason without Charles knowing
and if anything goes wrong, he's gonna be right there.
What about Sara?
What happens when A retaliates?
Aria, if this works, I promise you
there's not gonna be any fallout.
Charles is never gonna be able to hurt us
or anybody that we love ever again.
So let's say we go through with this.
How the hell are we supposed to remove these microchips?
Well..
Spencer and I have been studying videos online.
You can't be serious.
Oh, my God.
Who wants to go first?
I don't have much time. I'm in the middle of a shift.
Just hold still.
What's going on up there?
What's with the band-aid?
Just..
If you could hold your questions until afterwards
that would be great, okay?
Okay, I wanna tell you everything.
I'm going to tell you everything
but I need you to promise me one thing first.
You cannot tell anybody, including Tanner.
At least not at first.
I can't promise that.
Please, I'm not asking you for it forever.
I'm just asking you for one night.
Please.
This little boy is Jason.
And this one is A.
His name is Charles DiLaurentis.
What was she using these for?
Photographs.
Of what we went through?
Yeah.
You're gonna have to forgive yourself sometime.
Do you want me to go?
Spencer, this information could have helped us.
Tanner needed to know about this weeks ago.
I didn't have a choice.
A was holding a knife to Sara's throat.
He threatened everybody we've ever cared about.
Please, I just need one night.
If we do not fly under the radar, this won't work.
Jason's on the move. We've gotta go.
No, no, no. Nobody's going anywhere.
Toby, I just told you. It has to be this way.
You're not going near A or Charles
whatever that freak's name is.
You want my help, we're doin' it my way.
No, you can't tell Tanner.
If A finds out about this plan--
I got it, Spencer.
But if you try and follow me, or go near Jason
she's gonna be my first call.
Who has Jason's GPS?
I do. This is Caleb's burner phone.
Hanna, you're bleeding.
What? Where?
What do you mean where?
Where Dr. Amateur Hour cut your neck open.
You can't do this alone.
I'm not letting you come with me
and you're not letting me call Tanner
so alone's looking like our only option.
Please be careful.
And you call me the minute you find Jason.
Spencer, where's your surgical tape?
I'll be right there.
Going somewhere?
I'm just getting ready for bed, dad.
Not all of us are planning on standing guard all night.
You want some of this, or you just gonna eat
Spencer's candy all night?
I'm okay. Hey, maybe we should swing by Wallaby Avenue.
I heard there's some activity goin' on over there.
Break-ins.
I sure wouldn't.
It's not exactly our jurisdiction.
Yeah, but there's nothing goinon here tonight.
Those guys could use our help anyway.
Hey, come on. The car's over here.
Yeah, and we gotta let Command know we're going.
No, we don't.
You wanna leave our beat and not tell anyone?
Cavanaugh, what's goin' on?
I'll explain on the way.
You're gonna come with me or not?
Toby can't call you if he's following A.
Or if he's hurt.
Don't go there.
Like you said, Toby's a police officer.
He can take care of himself.
Did it download?
Yeah, it just finished.
Jason stopped ten minutes ago.
Hey, guys, this is right outside of Rosewood.
He should have called me by now.
Spence.
No!
He's supposed to be our backup.
Not some one-man target.
And if anything happens to him..
I'm going.
I'll go with you.
Okay, I didn't let Hanna perform surgery on me for nothing.
Let's go.
Come on.
We'll be okay.
斯宾塞 汉娜 艾米丽 艾瑞亚
Thank you for coming. You're the only one who answered my call.
Charles.
You here?
Charlie?
Came alone. Just like you asked.
Did you tell Mike where you were going?
How did you get out of there?
Sleeping pills.
I still couldn't find my dad's car keys though.
I'm just glad I could help.
I know I owe you. More than just a car ride.
Are you trying Jason again?
No.
No one's answering their phones, there's no point.
Then who are you calling?
911.
Alison, you can't do that!
911, emergency 23..
My name is Alison DiLaurentis.
Your emergency?
My friends and family are in danger.
I know who A is.
His name is Charles DiLaurentis, and he's my brother.
There's no one here.
Charlie.
Don't move!
Freeze!
Oh, my God!
On the ground, now!
Charlie!
Everybody, stay back.
Charlie, don't!
Watch it!
Watch it!
Oh, my God!
Toby!
No!
Oh, my God! Lorenzo, are you okay?
I'm okay, I'm okay.
Jason, I'm sorry.
Don't touch me!
You had him. I saw you.
I saw you. What happened?
Hold it! Freeze! Put your hands up.
Don't move!
Do not move!
Having two cops parked outside isn't enough?
You need one parked in the foyer, too?
Mom, we were so close to catching him.
That is not your job! You're a high school student.
Your job is to cash in that scholarship
and go to a good college and get yourself away from this mess.
Not to get yourself kidnapped again by some maniac.
Mom.
What?
What could you possibly have to say for yourself?
I don't think we should take it.
The scholarship.
What are you talkin' about?
Well, you said that Ali's mom
donated to The Carissimi Group.
If that company is somehow connected to the DiLaurentises then..
Look, I can't explain it,
but I have a really bad feeling about this money.
Hanna, listen to me.
With everything that that family has put you through
you deserve every last cent of that scholarship money.
Which is why I already deposited the check.
And believe me, that felt really great.
I don't wanna talk anymore, dad. Please.
They're pretty mad?
Yup.
You okay?
I talked to Mona.
We're gonna try and work things out.
You're really brave. You know that, right?
Then, why do I feel so scared?
All the time.
I'll leave you alone.
This came for you.
While you were out.
How are you feeling?
Look, I didn't know that she put those in my bag.
Okay, and I'm sure that you're only supposed to take, like, one.
I really should have told you that I was having problems.
We were so close.
If you hadn't have eaten..
Toby.
I need you to leave.
Wait in the lobby for your mom.
I can't have somebody come looking for you
and fi-fi-find me like this.
Okay.
Yeah.
恭喜艾瑞亚·蒙哥马利 你入围了
Don't do it, Jason.
Leave me alone.
He's not worth ruining your life for.
He's not the person that you remember.
You don't know what I remember, do you?
I was a kid when they took him.
And every memory I did have, they tried to erase.
Jason..
please.
I was gonna tell him to turn himself in.
I was gonna drive him to the police station.
All I wanted was one moment, Ali.
One moment alone with my brother.
Jason, Jason, come play with me.
Jason, Ali, wait for me.
I remember this day. Mom took us out of school.
And took us to the arcade for some second cousin's birthday.
She made us promise not to tell dad.
Ready...set, go.
Oh, Gosh.
You won.
Freddie. Freddie, come here, sweetheart.
Are you having a nice birthday?
Yeah.
When do I have to go back?
Oh, not for a while, sweetheart.
Go, go have fun.
Play nice now, okay?
Jason, Ali, you gonna sing..
Sing, loves.
"I wAnted to trust you."
Happy birthday.
Nice singing, you guys.
Good job, Freddie.
Yay!
