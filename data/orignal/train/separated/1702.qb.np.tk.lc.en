what are you doing ?
oh , uh , priya &apos;s calling in a few minutes on skype ,
and we are gonna have a dinner date .
it &apos;s 8 o &apos;clock in the morning in mumbai .
how can she have dinner ?
fine , whatever .
priya will be having breakfast .
all right , so technically it &apos;s not a dinner date .
i suppose you could call it a , uh , dinfast date .
but if you did , you &apos;d open yourself
to peer @-@ based mocking , such as ,
&quot; hey , leonard , how was your dinfast with priya last night ? &quot;
that doesn &apos;t sound like mocking .
you didn &apos;t let me finish .
dinfast .
are those soy @-@ based candles ?
i don &apos;t know . why ?
paraffin candles may contain carcinogens .
unless lung cancer is the ambiance
you were going for at your dinfast .
dinfast .
listen , i don &apos;t want to be rude ,
but priya &apos;s gonna be calling any minute , so ...
oh , yes , priya .
leonard , you know i make a point of
never interfering in your personal affairs .
yes , i &apos;ve always admired that about you .
as well you should .
but i &apos;m going to make an exception here .
oh , good .
priya has moved back to india to pursue her law career .
instead of desperately trying
to keep this intercontinental relationship alive ,
you could use that time to take up a hobby .
a hobby ?
yes .
i read recently about a fellow in kansas
with an enormous ball of twine .
i bet you could give him a run for his money .
you know , some people might say that it &apos;s great
that we &apos;re trying to make things work long distance .
they &apos;d say things like ,
&quot; love is stronger than the miles between you . &quot;
when i rise to power , those people will be sterilized .
you video @-@ chat with amy all the time .
how is this different ?
don &apos;t you like amy ?
of course i like amy .
well , there &apos;s the difference .
excuse me , that &apos;s priya .
hi , leonard .
hey , honey .
i miss you .
oh , i miss you , too .
i miss the old days when your romantic partners
could be returned to the video store .
thanks for letting me stay here
while leonard skypes with his girlfriend .
oh , it &apos;s no problem .
it &apos;s actually kind of nice .
you reading , me reading .
we &apos;re like an old married couple .
if we were an old married couple ,
the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles .
i don &apos;t have iced tea and snickerdoodles .
a good wife would go to the store .
i want a divorce .
good . on the way to see the lawyer ,
pick up some tea and cookies .
i must say , i am enjoying your new chair .
it &apos;s great , isn &apos;t it ?
it is .
aligns the lumbar ,
cradles the coccyx , balances the buttocks .
this is a chair worthy of the name .
what name ?
chair .
oh , all right , well , i &apos;m glad you like it .
i mean , i still can &apos;t get over the fact
someone just threw it away .
what ?
yeah , it was just sitting on the street .
i paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here .
oh , dear . oh , dear .
what is wrong ?
i &apos;ve been sitting in garbage !
sheldon , take it easy .
you take it easy ! i need to use your shower .
i went into this marriage with so much hope .
there &apos;s a wet band @-@ aid on the shower floor !
it is fun .
i &apos;ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before .
pretty sweet , huh ?
this little baby set the university back 175 grand .
that &apos;s three minutes .
oh , yeah .
this is one good @-@ looking panini .
hand me the tuna melt .
yep .
thank you .
how &apos;s it going with the long @-@ distance love affair ?
not easy , but we &apos;re making it work .
when you say &quot; making it work , &quot; does that include doing the cyber nasty ?
what ?
you know , the virtual pickle tickle .
the digital ... bow @-@ chicka @-@ bow @-@ bow .
come on , dude . this is my sister you &apos;re talking about .
hey , leonard jiggling his junk at her
through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with
than him actually touching her with it .
there &apos;s no junk jiggling .
we just talk .
are you insane ?
with high @-@ speed internet , you have at your fingertips
the greatest advancement in the field of sex
since the invention of the washcloth .
i can &apos;t do that .
well , if you don &apos;t ,
you &apos;re gonna lose priya to some fancy guy in a turban
who grew up with kama sutra coloring books .
how can you be so racist ?
oh , come on , tell me i &apos;m wrong .
oh , leonard , good .
there you are .
i need you to check my head for chair lice .
i did it last night , i &apos;m not doing it again .
just his head , right ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
you didn &apos;t catch bugs from penny &apos;s chair .
yes , i did .
and now they &apos;re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles
like dancing hippies at the redwood national forest .
sheldon , you do this all the time .
you fixate on some crazy idea
and then blow it way out of proportion .
name one time i &apos;ve ever done that .
how about when you put gps trackers in your garbage
because you were convinced north korean spies
were stealing your doodles ?
the chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets .
the strangely @-@ shaped cloud that was following you around town .
the time you put on my shirt by mistake
and were convinced you &apos;d started growing again .
i said , &quot; name one . &quot;
you really need to work on your listening skills .
penny .
penny . penny .
yello .
you need to remove that chair from the building .
it &apos;s a health hazard .
okay , relax . i took off the slipcovers ,
had them dry @-@ cleaned and then fumigated the cushions .
really ?
yeah . it &apos;s cleaner than my couch .
found half a hot pocket in there .
it certainly looks okay .
has a strong toxic chemical smell .
that &apos;s reassuring .
why don &apos;t you give it a try , sheldon ?
all right .
it is a comfortable chair .
why don &apos;t you just admit you overreacted ?
no , thank you .
it &apos;s like living with a chihuahua .
penny . penny . penny .
what &apos;s up , buttercup ?
you have to get rid of the chair .
nope .
penny . penny . penny .
what &apos;s the word , hummingbird ?
for your safety , please wait in my apartment
as i call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death .
no .
penny ! penny ! penny !
what &apos;s the gist , physicist ?
under my authority as a self @-@ appointed member
of the centers for disease control street team ...
... these premises are condemned .
as a man with a keen sense of style ,
i must tell you , that chair does not work with the room .
penny !
penny !
penny .
so , here we are .
back in bed together .
yep , here we are .
okay , so i @-@ i guess i &apos;ll just jump right in .
all right .
uh , you &apos;re a naughty girl .
and @-@ and , uh , i @-@ i want to punish you with my love ?
what ?
not good ?
that &apos;s terrible . try again .
okay .
uh , uh , you &apos;re ... not naughty .
uh , you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re dirty .
you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re a @-@ a dirty girl ?
oh , yes .
yes , i am .
yeah , yeah . uh , okay .
you &apos;re a , you &apos;re a ...
you &apos;re a @-@ a dirty ...
disgusting ...
revolting girl .
god , leonard , stop talking .
why don &apos;t you just give me five minutes ?
i &apos;ll google how to do this . i &apos;ll call you right back .
shh @-@ shh @-@ shh . just be quiet and do what i tell you .
okay , like usual . good .
take off your shirt .
all rightie . shirt coming off .
ta @-@ da ! man nipples .
i said be quiet.- yes , ma &apos;am .
now take off your shorts .
taking shorts off .
there we go .
naked , naked , naked !
wonderful .
now i &apos;ll take off my clothes .
cool .
here i am , baby .
you miss these ?
oh , damn it !
oh , leonard ! already ? !
no , no ! no @-@ no @-@ no !
the screen froze .
it &apos;s probably just buffering
just give it a second .
fine .
so , how are your mom and dad ?
yeah , i really don &apos;t want to talk about my parents now .
yeah . sure , sure .
if your video &apos;s frozen ,
try resetting the tcp / ip stack .
i didn &apos;t even think of that . thanks .
you &apos;re welcome . please let me know when
you and your girlfriend are done
hogging the bandwidth for your self @-@ abuse .
i &apos;m trying to stream a movie on netflix in here .
five , six , seven , eight .
* tall and tan and young and lovely *
* the girl from ipanema goes walking *
* and when she passes , each one she passes goes ... *
amy ? amy ? amy ?
* oh ... *
you are aware that your ritualistic knocking behavior is
symptomatic of obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder .
is not .
is not , is not .
denial . denial , denial . come in .
thank you .
would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp ?
no .
how about the theme song
to the classic television show diff &apos;rent strokes ?
* now the world don &apos;t move to the beat ... *
no .
well , that &apos;s every song i know . what &apos;s up ?
you &apos;re good friends with penny , right ?
best friends , besties ,
bffs , peas in a pod ,
sisters who would share traveling pants .
go on .
i was hoping she might listen to you
about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture .
for general educational purposes ,
or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera ?
cholera is water @-@ borne .
you &apos;re mocking me .
yes , i am .
penny has dragged a chair in off the street
whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare
of every resident in our building .
sheldon , just because you have a focus on
cleanliness bordering on the psychotic
doesn &apos;t mean i have to participate .
all right , name your price .
kiss me where i &apos;ve never been kissed before .
you mean like salt lake city ?
never mind . i &apos;ll talk to penny .
thank you .
will you listen to me play my harp now ?
no . i dislike the sound of the harp .
its overuse in classic television sitcoms
always makes me think i &apos;m going to
experience an episode from my past .
i &apos;m sorry , mommy . don &apos;t be mad at me .
don &apos;t do that !
i don &apos;t know about this , howard .
what ? you &apos;re having trouble with the long @-@ distance lovemaking .
this is your answer .
there are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth .
you have one , priya has one in india .
when you move your lips and tongue on yours ,
it transmits exactly what you &apos;re doing to hers .
see ? internet kissing .
give it a try .
i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;ll try it .
like this ?
almost . really get your tongue in there .
to activate the motion sensor .
like this ?
close . really french it .
better ?
yeah , you got it , you got it .
i &apos;m impressed . this is very lifelike .
whoa ! you just bit my tongue !
i @-@ i nibbled . i was being playful .
why do you have to make everything weird ?
sorry .
better ?
oh , yeah .
pretty cool , huh ?
probably would cost , like , 200 bucks in a store .
i do appreciate a bargain .
this entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother .
you &apos;re kidding .
everything except bra and panties .
and they &apos;re a leopard @-@ spotted secret i share with victoria .
and now me .
i just have one question about the chair .
and what &apos;s that ?
aren &apos;t you worried about it being unhygienic ?
no , it &apos;s completely fine ...
hmm . i get it .
sheldon sent you .
he put you up to this .
no , he didn &apos;t .
really ?
yes , he did . he absolutely did .
my god , amy , that &apos;s really crappy of you .
it is ?
yeah ! letting sheldon use you to manipulate me ?
i thought you were my friend .
no , i am your friend . please don &apos;t be mad at me .
i can &apos;t even believe this .
you know , maybe you should just go .
no ! no , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
i take it all back !
look ! i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m sitting in your chair .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
it &apos;s a great chair .
please let me continue to be part of your world .
what &apos;s wrong ?
something in the chair &apos;s biting my tushy .
it &apos;s not important . ow !
wait . get up , get up !
swear you won &apos;t tell sheldon what happened !
i swear !
can i tell my doctor ? i &apos;m probably gonna need shots !
yeah , sure !
oh , hey , babe , i think i figured this thing out .
oh , leonard , listen ...
no , you listen !
you &apos;re my woman ,
and i &apos;m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before .
leonard ...
that &apos;s right , say my name ...
and beg me for more , &apos; cause ...
i &apos;m gonna give it to you .
my parents are here .
hello , leonard ...
if i may also say your name .
check it out . free chair .
yeah .
hey , you know , if this was in sheldon and leonard &apos;s apartment ,
i wouldn &apos;t wind up sitting on the floor all the time .
on three ?
three !
three !
