nice meeting you .

just thank god that piece of shit from youngstown finally copped to that gun .
i could &apos;ve been wearing an orange jumpsuit till l &apos;m 90 .
well , you &apos;re home now , that &apos;s the important thing .
here , get back on your feet .
thanks , t.
not that i don &apos;t appreciate it ...
but i could &apos;ve used a boost when i was gone , too .
fucking bills . then there &apos;s ma with the private home care .
you know she almost lost her spot at green grove ?
an extra $ 5,000 it cost me just to hold her place .
you &apos;re here 30 seconds , you already got a fistful of cash ...
not to mention the no @-@ show jobs i got for you .
you &apos;re right , ton &apos; . i know . -enjoy the party .
i will .
were you having dinner at citris last year ...
when a man threw a drink in richard cross &apos; face ?
yes .
subsequent to that incident ... did mr. cross telephone rusty arnold ?
yes .
and the following day ... were you informed that the man in question ...
had suffered a fractured skull ?
your honor , objection . this whole line of questioning is irrelevant .
overruled . you may answer , miss costello .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m supposed to , judge .
i just made my ruling , you are required to answer .
but isn &apos;t there some law about testifying against your husband ?
excuse me ?
richard and i were married the night before last in reno .
your honor ... the defense requests a conference in chambers .
we &apos;ll stand in recess for 15 minutes ...
while the court confers with counsel in chambers .
bailiff , will you escort the jury out ?
did she say anything to you about this ?
what we saw in that courtroom is a transparent attempt by richard cross ...
to subvert the intent of the marital privilege .
hey , she &apos;s his wife .
where are my pants ?
there &apos;s some mouthwash and shit in the back . we &apos;ll go get breakfast .
oh , aspetta , i &apos;ll go with you .
any investment advice for an ambitious young man such as myself ?
buy land , l guess . god ain &apos;t making any more of it .
that &apos;s what will rogers said .
it &apos;s true , my house is worth nearly triple what i paid .
location &apos;s the key , right ? otherwise you get stuck with shit .
sometimes there &apos;s money in shit .
how do you mean ?
nothing , i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;re just talking here , come on .
i don &apos;t know . some guy i went to school with , this black guy ...
we worked one summer for this not @-@ for @-@ profit housing group .
told me about some scam his minister was involved with up in harlem .
i read about this . forgazee mortgage loans or something , right ?
actually , you ever hear of hud ?
housing development , yeah .
hud was set up to help minorities and low @-@ income families to be homeowners .
there are more programs for these deadbeats , i swear to c &apos;hrist .
if the feds guarantee the home mortgage ,
the banks figure , why not ? they &apos;ll loan the money .
you get a front man to buy houses in some crummy neighborhood .
talking about some real shitboxes . maybe they &apos;re worth $ 100,000 apiece .
next , you tie up with some non @-@ profit organization who goes to hud ...
and says they intend to buy these houses from your stooge .
they &apos;re gonna convert them to homes for working @-@ class blacks , blah @-@ blah @-@ blah .
thing is , though ....
all right , sit tight . i &apos;m gonna be a while .
i &apos;ll be over here .
maurice and i met in college . all the way to the university of michigan ...
to make friends with a guy who lived 20 blocks away from me .
you should &apos;ve seen the jew @-@ fro on this guy .
out to here .
so , maurice , ron tells me you &apos;re from down roseville street .
my father was a typesetter for the star @-@ ledger .
no shit ? -sixth and orange .
then we were practically neighbors .
yeah , that &apos;s why he moved .
hello .
c &apos;armela , it &apos;s me , furio .
i guess l missed you this morning , i was in the bathtub .
the reason i call ... i leave my sunglasses in some place , i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re kidding . let me have a look around .
so how is everything ? how &apos;s your dad ?
not so good .
but i get the pictures from the housewarm finally .
good , bring them next time .
i will .
there &apos;s a pretty one of you .
that &apos;s sweet .
i don &apos;t see the glasses , fur &apos; .
that &apos;s okay , i probably leave them home .
all right . if i find them , i &apos;ll give you a call .
okay .
i see you soon .
the summer of &apos; 67 , we &apos;re both home on break .
i &apos;m interning at the state legislature and he .... what were you doing ?
east newark food c &apos;o @-@ op . -right .
but come july--
the newark riots .
what a fucking summer that was .
later that year , maurice and i helped
organize one of the first black voting drives .
maurice , were you around for anthony lmperiale ?
the white knight ?
around ? who do you think he was fighting against ?
&quot; ltalian pride , keep newark white . &quot;
aspiring klansmen , some of those boys .
so this group you got now , the urban housing league .
what &apos;s the story there ?
like many non @-@ profits ... we &apos;ve fallen on hard times .
republican administration ,
plus a proliferation ... of new charities post 9l1.1 .
sounds like you got a lot to talk about . i &apos;m gonna hit the showers .
maurice , nice meeting you . same here .
i took the liberty of filling maurice in on the broad strokes .
okay , we got a guy , dr. fried , he &apos;s a urologist .
we &apos;ll give him $ 500,000 of our money .
have him grab up these four houses on garside street ...
for $ 1.25,000 apiece . the old first ward .
once we own the houses , we got an appraiser who &apos;ll play ball .
he &apos;s gonna re @-@ appraise them in the $ 300,000 range .
what you do , maurice , is take the phony appraisals to hud .
tell them your urban housing thing wants to buy up these shitholes .
c &apos;onvert them to low @-@ cost housing for working families .
once hud guarantees the mortgage app , you take it to the bank .
they cut a check , and we work it up nice .
at which point , i assume my organization fails to make the mortgage payment .
unforeseen construction delays and repeated vandalism ...
force the project into dissolution . we all walk away from the houses .
your cut &apos;ll be in the 10 percent of the profit range .
my office &apos;ll write a letter in strong support of your application .
sounds about right .
tony , good . you &apos;re still here .
ls there a problem ?
no problem , i just wanna talk to you .
you remember that time in atlantic c &apos;ity ?
you brought lrina , your old girlfriend ?
yeah , the cystic fibrosis thing , the fundraiser .
god . this is awkward .
irina and i are seeing each other .
what ? you &apos;re fucking kidding me .
i met her that night at the fundraiser . i gave her my card .
she was having some problem with her landlord .
she called me months later ,
after you two broke it off ... -one thing led to another--
lt &apos;s ancient history .
all right , take it easy . i wanted to tell you .
i feel like i owe you an explanation .
what am i , her father ? you &apos;re both adults . enjoy yourself .
it &apos;s more than that . i care for her .
very deeply . roz and i are separated .
the heart wants what the heart wants , l guess .
the heart also wants what the dick wants .
okay , who &apos;s gonna scrub my back ?
ralph , you steal my water ?
man , i love this song .
the c &apos;hi @-@ lites . the best .
believe it or not , the c &apos;hi @-@ lites were signed to the same label ...
as tommy james and them damn shondells .
see , a lot of people think that , but they &apos;re wrong .
c &apos;hi @-@ lites were on brunswick .
see you soon .
so , tony , anyway ....
look , she &apos;s a great girl .
beautiful girl , a little needy .
frankly , i &apos;m glad to have her off my payroll .
thanks for understanding .
wish you nothing but the best , bro .
dr. fried , you are now the legal owner .
eat my dust , donald trump .
hey , adriana .
jesus c &apos;hrist !
why don &apos;t you go haunt a house or something ?
it &apos;s been a while , figured i &apos;d check in .
so you crawl up my ass ?
what do you want , robyn ?
i heard paulie gualtieri &apos;s out of jail .
what do i know ?
how does c &apos;hristopher feel about that ?
c &apos;hristopher likes paulie , they &apos;re friends .
ls that a crime now , too ?
how is c &apos;hristopher anyway ? he looked tired last time l saw him .
if you &apos;re gonna turn me into a traitor , fine ...
but do me a favor and stop asking about him like you give a shit how he is .
how is he doing with his drug problem ?
he doesn &apos;t have a drug problem .
how are you doing , ade ?
really .
i &apos;m fine .
we &apos;re both fine .
as a matter of fact , we &apos;re thinking of finally getting married .
you have a good time today ?
yeah , it was cool . i love the ocean .
feel like taking a ride ?
see that church ?
your great grandfather helped build that almost 80 years ago .
he was a stonemason , the old man .
c &apos;ame over from avellino with $ 4 in his pocket .
yeah , but i saw in a book where you could get a hotel room ...
for , like , 10 cents a week then .
room service must &apos;ve been , like , one or two cents a meal .
room service ? we &apos;re talking about history here , a.j.
your family &apos;s history . newark &apos;s history .
who gives a shit about newark ?
i &apos;m making a point .
this neighborhood used to be beautiful . hundred percent ltalian .
the 1920s , most of them right off the boat .
most ltalians couldn &apos;t even find a church that wanted them .
so what did they do , did they cry ?
did they go to the government with their hand out ? no .
they took care of their own problems .
they said , &quot; you don &apos;t want us here ? fine . we &apos;ll build our own , a better one . &quot;
look at all these buildings around here .
most of them are falling down into the ground .
but that church is still standing .
you know why ?
the bricks ?
&apos;c &apos;ause our people give a shit , that &apos;s why .
every sunday , ltalians from the old neighborhood drive miles ...
to come here to pray .
they keep this place alive .
so how come we never do ?
buy land , a.j. , &apos; cause god ain &apos;t making any more of it .
this is advice i &apos;m imparting to you as your father .
now what ?
are you afraid ?
right , like i haven &apos;t seen places like this before .
see those houses over there ?
i &apos;m buying them .
those crappy ones ? what for ?
for an investment .
what have i been saying ?
i don &apos;t know .
real estate . buy real estate .
dad , the black dude &apos;s coming over .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
what &apos;s up ? five @-@ o ?
yeah , i &apos;m starsky and this is hutch .
smoke , crack , or crank ?
no , thank you , we &apos;re just having a look around .
no eyeing if you ain &apos;t buying , man .
thought this was a free country .
unless you want something , motherfucker , get the fuck off our street .
the language on you . you blow your father with that mouth ?
what the fuck you say to my sister ?
relax , i don &apos;t want trouble . i &apos;m showing my son the old neighborhood .
this is our neighborhood now . guinea motherfucker .
yeah , l can see that .
so that &apos;s a crack ho .
keep your fucking cracker ass off my motherfucking block !
c &apos;ome on , ease up .
she &apos;s really gonna marry him ?
what is wrong with this girl ? -c &apos;ome on .
moltisanti &apos;s a great catch .
tall , dark , and sociopathic .
from a strategic standpoint , do the nuptials help us or hurt us ?
lf they do get married ... brings them closer , obviously .
and by extension , gets her closer to tony .
lt could cause her to stop cooperating .
the guilt becomes overwhelming . remember angel diletto ?
i think it &apos;s more likely to have the opposite effect .
his problems really become her problems .
lf they have kids , that &apos;s even more pressure .
the dilettos never had kids .
i wouldn &apos;t count on children .
she &apos;s had some issues . female trouble .
maybe darwin was right . nature really does weed out the nimrods .
so what do we do , people ? yay or nay ?
supportive or discouraging ?
lf anyone objects to this marriage , speak now or forever hold your peace .
i say neutral or supportive .
even if we discourage it , she &apos;ll go through with it anyway .
agreed then . they have our blessing .
to the happy couple .
these doctors own so much property .
you &apos;re going to buy four houses on garside street ?
you &apos;ve certainly got your work cut out for you .
one day at a time .
keep on keeping on .
tony . c &apos;ome on in .
you know , it really would &apos;ve been better if we met over at denny &apos;s .
what are you worried about ? i was in the neighborhood .
so , what &apos;s up ? c &apos;an l get you something ?
scotch , right ?
i sent some of my guys down there to start gutting the place .
turned out one of the houses was a crack den .
so ?
what , &quot; so &quot; ?
we got to get them out of there .
why didn &apos;t your guys roust them ?
oh , nice . bunch of white guys setting off caps in the ghetto .
that won &apos;t attract any attention at all .
what do you want me to do ?
exert some influence , make some calls .
get the donut squad to go down there and roust the shitbags .
tony , it &apos;s not that easy--
hello , tony .
how you doing , hon ?
i &apos;m very good .
no , i &apos;m very well . thanks you very much .
she &apos;s taking a class at the community college , english as a second language .
you sound great .
ronnie , i &apos;ll go make some lunch , some egg salad ?
great . you hungry ?
no .
go light on the mayo .
look ,
when you &apos;re dealing with squatters &apos; rights ...
or anything having to do with the homeless ... it can get very tricky .
homeless ? they &apos;re a bunch of fucking crackheads .
i understand they &apos;re gumming up the works .
but try to see the big picture . the hud approval came through .
ln two weeks , we &apos;re gonna be looking at a huge windfall .
see , that &apos;s why you &apos;re a politician and not a businessman .
maximum value is the big picture .
there must be $ 7,000 of copper pipe in there ,
if they haven &apos;t taken it out already .
i still don &apos;t know what you expect me to do about it .
okay , all right .
we &apos;ll take the $ 7,000 out of your end ?
well , no , but--
c &apos;ome on , ronnie .
university of michigan .
fucking figure it out .
good dinner , baby .
c &apos;hristopher .
let &apos;s get married .
whoa !
where &apos;d this come from ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s gonna be two years we &apos;re engaged .
let &apos;s just go down to c &apos;ity hall .
c &apos;ity hall ? what are we , schwugs ?
you said you wanted a big wedding anyway .
i don &apos;t care about that shit .
i just want you .
it &apos;ll be cheaper anyway , we could buy a house .
plus , a wife ...
can &apos;t testify against her husband .
you can &apos;t have a club , stay out all night getting high when you have a kid .
what if we didn &apos;t have kids ?
fuck that ! what &apos;s the point of being married ?
i mean , what if we can &apos;t ? if l can &apos;t ?
would you still love me ?
of course i &apos;d still love you .
why ?
there &apos;s something you should know .
a long time ago , years ago ... i had a medical procedure .
it was before we met .
my uterus got pierced .
both of them ?
there &apos;s only one . that &apos;s ovaries .
so what does that mean ? you can &apos;t get pregnant ?
my doctor said it might be hard .
a friend gave me the name of a specialist in manhattan .
you knew you were damaged goods and you never fucking told me ?
how could you call me that ?
jesus fucking c &apos;hrist !
how could you lie to me like that ?
i tried to tell you once . i wanted to .
i was afraid that you wouldn &apos;t propose .
you don &apos;t get it , adriana .
i don &apos;t have a son , the moltisanti name ends ! that &apos;s it !
we could adopt .
yeah , that &apos;s great !
some kid with chinky eyes called moltisanti !
he &apos;d get his ass kicked every day !
you said you &apos;d still love me . that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;ll fucking marry you !
she &apos;s a great girl , c &apos;hristopher . you don &apos;t want to lose this one .
t &apos;s right . you could have more kids than the kennedys ...
if you &apos;re married to some twat , what good is it ?
gotta have balance in a relationship .
i know all that . but what if the kid thing never happens ?
c &apos;ome on , medicine today ? technology ?
you want my advice ?
and this is nothing about ade or anybody else .
stay single as long as you can .
c &apos;ome on , what are you saying ?
no offense , but ask me , marriage and our thing don &apos;t jive .
everybody we know is married .
not everybody .
you love her , right ?
yeah . you know .
then do the right thing .
when the shoe was on the other foot , your spleen ...
she stood by you , right ?
do you want to end up like my uncle junior ?
or worse , like paulie ?
exactly .
all right , thanks . i &apos;ve got to think about it .
all right .
ron !
hi , lenore .
what a nice surprise . we &apos;re overdue for that dinner , the four of us .
we absolutely are .
here they come .
we &apos;re late for practice . he &apos;s in the den .
okay , thanks .
the fact is , mo , these people are criminals .
drug addicts and dealers who &apos;ve been occupying that house illegally .
what about the police ? get the seller , the urologist ,
to make the call .
they &apos;re crack addicts .
they &apos;ll be back there living in two hours .
the deal was for me to effectuate the purchase of these houses , period .
i realize that . nobody mentioned anything about violence .
we renounced it , remember ?
then eldridge went into the codpiece business .
i &apos;m in a bind here . what do you expect me to do ?
get some of your people to handle it .
what people ?
well , we can &apos;t send whites in there .
people of color . you run a youth gang outreach program , don &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m on the board , ron .
fine , i understand .
take the $ 7,000 this is costing out of your end then .
c &apos;ome on . you know what i pay in child support to my first wife .
the chances i &apos;m taking with this .
i &apos;m putting it all on the line if i get caught .
get some kids , gangbangers , whatever , you throw them some money .
when you think about it from a policing standpoint ...
it &apos;s one group of recidivists beating on another .
stop trying to justify it .
lt &apos;s about the $ 7,000 .
let me tell you something else .
guys like tony , you don &apos;t fool around with these people .
my son ...
i don &apos;t know what he understands .
l &apos;m trying to tell him about the immigrants .
he &apos;s talking about room service .
we need to talk about your recent behavior in here .
your angry tirade ? -you want to talk about that now ?
that was weeks ago .
it was my judgment that at the time
you were in crisis about gloria &apos;s suicide .
didn &apos;t you get the flowers i sent ?
your behavior was unacceptable , anthony .
you cannot have these outbursts and expect to redeem yourself ...
with an ftd bouquet .
l &apos;m sorry , all right ?
lt &apos;s good that you &apos;re sorry , but no , it &apos;s not all right .
we &apos;ve been down this road before .
i know . the fact that you &apos;re angry is fine .
and it &apos;s okay to talk about your anger .
but when it manifests itself in physicality ...
it becomes unacceptable .
i never laid a finger on you .
you loomed .
you threw my tissue holder .
then i picked it up .
i was very upset . you lied to me .
i did not lie to you .
you withheld information about a very sensitive subject .
all right , look .
i know what i did was wrong . okay ?
and you may not believe this ... but i did exercise impulse control ,
and i have been controlling my anger .
this thing with my son , i went to show him the old neighborhood ...
and we got accosted by these crackheads .
one of them had a gun . the other one threw a bottle at my car .
now it may not sound like much , but l let it go . i drove away .
well , in the future , i &apos;ll ask that you extend to me ...
the same courtesy you would a crack addict .
all right , as long as we &apos;re being truthful here , you know , opening up ?
i &apos;ve been holding a grudge against you for recommending that wendi kobler ...
that half @-@ assed adolescent shrink .
that stupid bitch almost sent my daughter to barcelona .
you &apos;re right , it &apos;s no excuse .
i knew i hit something last night when i turned off the road .
up and at them , lieutenant .
how was your ride ?
busted brake line .
yeah , what &apos;s it look like ?
like a busted brake line , man .
good morning , honey .
can you fix it , b.a. ?
gonna try . thanks , hannibal .
i need those .
what do you need my tools for ?
going to get my hands on the tape that &apos;ll prove calvin cutter &apos;s a murderer .
i won &apos;t leave the county without proof .
the tape won &apos;t do us good if we can &apos;t get out of the county with it .
listen , i &apos;ve been doing some thinking ...
the kid thing and all .
i &apos;m not happy that you lied to me .
but i think i want to try and deal with it .
really ?
i love you , adriana . i want you in my life .
i love you , too , c &apos;hristopher .
are you high ?
you gotta start with that now ?
i just want to be sure it &apos;s real .
it is real .
i love you .
when can we get married ?
i was thinking maybe our anniversary , we could go to vegas .
vegas ? want to get married by some elvis impersonator ?
we would save money at least .
no , it &apos;s a sacrament , ade .
why don &apos;t we have it here ? all your friends could come .
we &apos;ll have it in the great room , or in the yard even , if it &apos;s nice out .
we can have artie cater it .
l think c &apos;hristopher will ask tony to be his best man .
i am sure he will be honored .
does your mother know ?
you &apos;re the first person i &apos;ve told .
we &apos;ll decorate the whole house with mums .
believe me , you will not save any money in vegas .
my cousin jackie and her husband tommy , $ 60,000 at blackjack .
i &apos;m getting married !
i know !
give me some of that .
remember , just shoot the ceiling and shit . no 187 s .
get the fuck out my house , motherfuckers !

lt &apos;s not that , it &apos;s just .... the american taxpayers--
they pay for airport security , look how well that &apos;s going .
give me a fucking break .
this is like a $ 15,000 watch , tony . i can &apos;t take this .
lt &apos;s just a little thank you , that &apos;s all .
a.j. , what are you doing down there ?

i gotta get dressed .
furio , hi , good morning .

why ? don &apos;t you want some coffee ?
the motor is acting funny .
i need to keep my foot on the gas pedal .
well , okay . i was looking forward to seeing those pictures .
i &apos;ll let tony know you &apos;re here .
furio &apos;s here .
you doing some work on the house ?
yeah , you know . sinking some anchors for a wall mirror .
thank you .
how &apos;s the mousse ?
fucking great .
l tell you ... the shit you miss when you &apos;re inside ?
there was a week where i would &apos;ve killed for some good &amp; plentys .
should &apos;ve told me .
l would &apos;ve sent you some .
i know you would &apos;ve .
see , that &apos;s the thing though .
what i need &apos;s not your problem .
what do you mean ?
fucking tony .
four months l &apos;m up there , like the man in the lron mask .
not one visit . not even a fucking phone call .
the guy didn &apos;t reach out at all ?
when do i ever complain ?
paulie , look , the guy &apos;s the boss .
you visit a guy in the can these days .... you know the feds .
you give someone the time of day , it &apos;s a criminal conspiracy .
so he can &apos;t phone ? you fucking did .
even before i left , he was treating me like the ugly girl at the dance .
i &apos;m sucking wind , and he &apos;s rolling in it with that fucking c &apos;hrist killer .
hesh ?
fucking zellman ,
fucking real estate scam .
the frelinghuysen avenue thing .
we had some words .
tony made it right .
lt &apos;s a different one now .
i &apos;m not sure what it is .
all l know is fucking ralphie &apos;s going around
bragging about how much they &apos;re making .
listen , john , i know we talk sometimes .
i tell you my problems , you tell me yours .
i have the highest regards for c &apos;armine .
he thinks the world of you , also .
even still , this shit don &apos;t leave the table , right ?
i &apos;m hurt that you even have to ask .
as far as we know , those transformers are perfectly safe ...
but i &apos;ll propose an ad @-@ hoc study .
thank you , assemblyman .
okay , bye @-@ bye .
mr. olmstead called regarding lunch ,
and you &apos;ve got the zoning hearing at 4 : 00 .
i &apos;ll call him later , i &apos;m going to make a stop .
l &apos;ll see you back at the office
and make sure that she &apos;s on the list for the fundraiser .
does this go your cousins ?
no , verrazano salvage , ask for gene .
don &apos;t forget the fireplace mantles and the wall sconces .
downtown , the yuppies pay top dollar .
we &apos;re on it , ton &apos; , don &apos;t worry .
assemblyman . what brings you to beautiful downtown newark ?
meeting with one of my constituents .
you going to be at the bing tomorrow ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
maybe l &apos;ll see you over there then .
maybe you will .
ls it going to be a nice house here now ?
i &apos;m taking it . i &apos;ll put it on my card , okay ? it &apos;s with my clothes .
i &apos;ll get the seamstress .
l can &apos;t believe you &apos;re finally doing this . so sudden , too .
the best part is going to be seeing how much people give us .
lisa told me at her and ricky &apos;s wedding ,
bobby c &apos;anzoneri didn &apos;t cover his plate .
shut up .
$ 40 in an envelope , not even a card .
i &apos;ll tell you , though , the main thing about getting married ?
i can never be called to testify . what do you mean ?
a wife can &apos;t testify against her husband ?
right .
actually , though , l don &apos;t think that &apos;s actually true .
what do you mean ?
they did a whole murder , she wrote about that .
this butler thought his wife couldn &apos;t testify against her husband ...
but it turns out , legally she actually could .
to claim marital privilege , three conditions must be met .
the communication must be made during the course of the marriage .
anything said before you were married is fair game .
two , the communication must involve only the spouses .
the presence of a third party destroys the privilege .
three , communication can &apos;t be made in furtherance of a crime .
oh , my god , it &apos;s a simple question . c &apos;an they make me testify or not ?
the short answer ? probably .
ln organized crime , a rlc &apos;o ,
the feds will spend a fortune putting on their case .
believe me , if they want you to testify , they &apos;re going to find a way .
here you go , 10 percent apiece .
technically , it &apos;s a little less ...
but our friend rounded you up to an even $ 60,000 .
there &apos;s plenty more where that came from .
a lot of poor families need affordable housing in newark .
ronnie , listen ...
i didn &apos;t want to say this .
no hard feelings ?
of course not .
you sure you &apos;re all right ?
i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re just being ....
you &apos;re being awfully quiet .
i don &apos;t know , tired .
you ever feel bad about any of this ?
what do you mean ?
when i think about where we started out ....
i used to think what i did made a difference .
the anti @-@ drug programs , the voter drives .
but over the years ... it &apos;s like shoveling shit against the tide , you know that .
i guess .
you cut corners , but you help out .
do the best you can .
if it ain &apos;t us , it &apos;s going to be somebody else . really , i mean ....
what are we supposed to be , the only honest men ?
we were going to lead a revolution .
revolution .
the revolution got sold , ronnie .
you heard the beatles for h &amp; r block ?
sometimes i feel like i should be punished .
c &apos;ome on , let &apos;s get something to eat .
here &apos;s something i never thought i &apos;d say :
to the federal government .
depends on which department .
a cappuccino maker , this is great .
ls that the c &apos;apresso ? you &apos;ll love that , ade .
c &apos;appuccino now . he used to drink bosco .
i got it at fortunoff &apos;s if you want to exchange it .
no scissors ,
bad luck !
that &apos;s from me . i can &apos;t count
how many cheese melts i &apos;ve made for silvio in that thing .
here , open this one , ade .
you got anything to drink ?
what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s up ?
look , why don &apos;t you just calm down and-- i &apos;m perfectly calm .
we can talk about whatever &apos;s bothering you .
tony , this is crazy .
c &apos;ome on , fuck !
tony , no !
all the girls in new jersey , you had to fuck this one ?
go ahead , cry like a bitch .
ronnie .
