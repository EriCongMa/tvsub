okay , max , i figured out our new schedule .
and i figured out the cheap toothpaste
we &apos;ve been using is really diaper cream .
on the plus side , that rash cleared up on my gums .
we &apos;ll do our diner shift from 6 : 00 till 2 : 00,
then sell cupcakes here from 2 : 00 to 4 : 00,
make the cupcakes in the morning from 7 : 00 to 11 : 00,
and then pastry school from 12 : 00 to 4 : 00 .
forget anything ?
just poopin &apos; and sleepin &apos; .
now , i have to go rewrite the schedule .
let &apos;s go , max , you have a huge , huge day tomorrow .
first day of pastry school .
stop saying it &apos;s huge .
whenever i think something &apos;s gonna be huge ,
it just turns out to be all balls .
i splurged and had my blouse cleaned .
dry cleaning bags remind me of when i had money .
really ? they remind me of
when my mother tried to suffocate me .
allegedly . let &apos;s go .
wait , wait . max , you can &apos;t go yet .
i need you to stay and help with something .
han , i told you-- it &apos;s bend and wipe ,
then up come your big boy pants .
yeah , han &apos;s right . you can &apos;t go .
stay here a few more minutes .
why ?
are we having an intervention for max ?
hey , everybody .
oh , i hope i &apos;m not late for max &apos;s
first day of school surprise party .
sophie , we hadn &apos;t surprised her yet .
oh , but she &apos;s right there .
you just blew it , han .
aw , a surprise party .
isn &apos;t this sweet , max ?
i don &apos;t trust it .
last time oleg yelled &quot; surprise &quot; at me ,
his penis was on a hot dog bun .
one meat lover &apos;s pizza .
and one meat lover .
max , come on . get it while it &apos;s hot .
you &apos;re opening that box .
hm , who &apos;s got a ten
to tip the cute pizza delivery guy ?
sophie , this is luis , the day waiter .
oh , you &apos;re sophie ,
oleg &apos;s ex .
sister , i know all about you .
oh , do you ?
do you know all about me ?
i &apos;m his good friend .
you know , i &apos;m having trouble hearing your accent .
did you say &quot; good friend &quot; or &quot; girlfriend ? &quot;
please , mami . i wish .
i like the entertainment .
it &apos;s better than the magician at my friend stephanie &apos;s 16th birthday
that made her virginity disappear .
max , we &apos;re all so proud of you .
tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life .
aw , crap . i gotta do this again ?
all right , but this time ,
i &apos;m not seeing trouble with the curve .
you are about to do something very big .
yes , she is . such a big step .
big step for both of us ,
&apos;cause i &apos;ll be using my business acumen
working in the office to help pay the tuition .
shh . i &apos;m talking about max .
so we all chipped in to get you something
for your first day of school .
it &apos;s my first day too .
caroline , please ,
i can &apos;t hear han talking about max , okay ?
here you go , darling ,
a book bag for school .
so what , then ? is my surprise party after this one ?
what is happening ?
people doing nice things for me and smiling ?
am i transferring foster homes again ?
and there &apos;s more stuff inside .
that was supposed to be a surprise too .
oh . surprise !
max , open it . look inside .
yeah , max , see what &apos;s inside for your big day .
big day for max . big day for me as well .
a metrocard ? no way .
from me . unlimited rides .
oh . unlimited rides ?
is that what your tramp stamp says ?
i was gonna get mad , but that was a damn good one .
what &apos;s this ? han &apos;s house ?
a simple &quot; thank you &quot; would suffice .
thank you for your house , han .
it &apos;s a pencil case , and i love it .
and i was sitting here , thinking how you were
all ignoring my part of the big day .
and then , you give me this pencil case
to use in the office and prove me wrong .
that &apos;s for max .
what the hell is wrong with you people ?
max doesn &apos;t even need pencils .
she &apos;ll be baking .
well , she &apos;ll be baked .
take a look .
joints .
earl , that &apos;s so sweet .
these should last me till recess .
wait , where &apos;s the chef &apos;s coat sophie had monogrammed ?
han , that was supposed to be a surprise .
oh , i know . karma &apos;s a bitch .
oh , well .
look .
my name &apos;s on this .
the only thing my name &apos;s ever been on before
is a urine sample .
thank you , everyone .
so there is nothing in that bag for me ?
nothing ?
i &apos;d even take oleg &apos;s penis in a hot dog bun right now .
i &apos;ll be right back .
getting on .
please move .
getting on .
please move .
getting on .
please move .
on !
move !
on ! on !
move ! move !
i love the subway .
it &apos;s the perfect place to get out aggression .
i just punched someone in the kidney .
it was me .
i know .
oh , oh , bad smell ,
like someone hooked up with a falafel .
it was me .
i know .
max .
sorry .
subways , planes , and mosh pits , i let it ride .
i love the smell of this fresh , dry @-@ cleaned blouse .
i am so excited to be out of that waitress uniform ,
and back in my chic business clothes ,
and , you know , going to my office ,
where i &apos;ll probably save the day
using some of my wharton magic .
you know , i think i like you better without hope .
max , you know this school is expensive , right ?
you &apos;re going in with a good attitude , right ?
no , that &apos;s what earl &apos;s pencils are for .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll do my best .
i mean , look , i have a book bag .
the only thing my mother ever sent me to school with
was a note that said &quot; check me for lice . &quot;
it was so sweet of everyone to give you that ,
even though i didn &apos;t sleep all night about it .
and it looks kind of expensive .
check for a designer label .
why ? it &apos;s the thought that counts .
since when ?
let me see it .
second avenue station .
this is second avenue .
no , no , no , max !
no , he got the book bag . good , max , good .
don &apos;t let go .
what if the train starts to leave
and my arms pop off ?
how will i go to pastry school ?
i &apos;ll be one of those people decorating cookies
with a bag in their mouth .
you are the devil .
the devil .
you have nothing .
pull , max , pull ! pull it from the devil !
can &apos;t . the devil works out .
my bag .
my blouse .
my weed .
oh , great , look . class has started .
my new life already blows .
oh , look . there &apos;s chef gorgeous .
i don &apos;t want him to see me like this .
i &apos;m gonna go to the restroom and see
if cold water can get out any of the stain .
go , max .
but i don &apos;t have my chef coat or book bag .
i know i only had them for a couple of hours ,
but it was the best part of me .
you &apos;ll do great .
first , do me a favor . check me for lice .
this course is designed to introduce you
to the skills and techniques required
in the production of yeast bread ,
short pastry doughs , custards , pate a choux ,
and cake batters .
chef max , you are late .
wait , are sure class doesn &apos;t start at 10 : 17 ?
sorry , i got robbed on the subway by some jerk .
hey , hey , hey , i &apos;m right here .
i ran out of options , and i didn &apos;t wanna
strip my way through pastry school .
that &apos;s an option ?
all right , chefs . let &apos;s focus .
did he say he wants to &quot; foke us &quot; ?
morning , bebe .
hi . oh , my god . what happened to you ?
and i should tell you my doctor says
i &apos;m not allowed to hear bad news for another month .
i apologize for my appearance .
we got robbed on the subway ,
and then someone hit me with hot coffee .
then , i went to wash cold water on the stain
and somehow wound up entering myself
in a wet t @-@ shirt contest .
um , that &apos;s a lot of energy for me ,
so i &apos;m just gonna need to sit here
for a second and be quiet .
i know we &apos;re being quiet , which i &apos;m all about ,
but cute dogs .
oh , thanks . they &apos;re cocker spaniels .
i rescue them .
you know , people rescue greyhounds and pit bulls ,
but everyone ignores the cocker spaniel .
they &apos;re like , &quot; ew , eye goo . shoot it . &quot;
i have three cockers .
do you have any pets ?
i have a horse , chestnut .
he &apos;s a thoroughbred .
well , what can i do first ?
what &apos;s this ? why am i holding a juice menu ?
every day , we get fresh @-@ pressed juice
for the students and the staff .
what a treat .
fresh juice is such a scam
unless someone else is payin &apos; .
i &apos;ll take the greens number three .
uh @-@ huh , well , put it on the list
when you get the other ones .
wait , i &apos;m supposed to get the juice ?
oh , boy , it &apos;s like i &apos;m a bad news machine .
okay .
happy to do it . surprised , but happy .
uh , maybe i could change into one of those cute chef jackets .
oh , chef nicholas only permits pastry chefs to wear these .
but i can &apos;t meet everyone on my first day looking like this .
i mean , it &apos;s already bad enough i &apos;m the juice girl .
i have some workout clothes you can wear .
don &apos;t worry . i haven &apos;t worn them yet .
but i will someday .
hi . hi , everyone .
i &apos;m here to take the fresh juice orders
and also to say this is not what i came to work in .
what i came to work in had less eyes .
caroline , welcome .
how is it going in the office so far ?
so great ,
and so not what i came to work in .
i &apos;m usually wearing chanel , not le chien .
that &apos;s &quot; dog &quot; in french .
oh , &apos; cause it &apos;s &quot; dork &quot; in english .
well , it is lovely to see both of your faces .
class , we start with the basics .
no , no , no , you in the back--
juice , miss ? care for a juice
from someone who scored 1560 on her sats ?
you can score more than 500 ?
why the hell are you wearing that ?
i didn &apos;t think your chest could get any sadder .
it &apos;s bebe &apos;s .
max , taking juice orders is not what i came here to do .
i hear you . i &apos;ll have the ruby red .
i always keep the edge clean ,
so when i &apos;m squeezing it ,
it &apos;s not gonna have cream popping all over the place .
words to live by .
i have the opposite problem .
yo , my cream &apos;s poppin &apos; right now .
what are you doing ?
you told me you were gonna take school seriously .
it &apos;s not me . that guy &apos;s a bad influence .
look at him .
he looks like someone who sells drugs on sesame street .
you &apos;re gonna get in trouble ,
and i am not wearing a cocker spaniel
so you can get kicked out of class .
right . i hear you .
now , where &apos;s my juice ?
hey , chef max . check out my technique .
awesome gross sound bonus .
chef , if you find this so funny ,
why don &apos;t you take a fiver ?
isn &apos;t this how your saying goes ?
i don &apos;t have a saying ,
but if i did , it &apos;d be more like
&quot; eatin &apos; ain &apos;t cheatin &apos; . &quot;
anyone else who finds something hilarious
can also go into the hall .
chef max ?
nope , nothing &apos; ilarious .
teach on .
enough with the dirty jokes .
we are all here to become master bakers .
master @-@ baking is something i work really hard at it .
to be a master baker--
i &apos;ll be in the hall .
hi , i &apos;m deke .
did you say &quot; freak ? &quot;
deke .
did you say &quot; geek ? &quot;
deke , as in &quot; big deke . &quot;
mine &apos;s bigger .
we should be lab partners .
come on . it &apos;ll be bitchin &apos; .
max and deke , making cakes .
sunday , sunday , sunday ,
with a special performance by creed .
okay , now stop , stop , stop .
i am trying to be a good student ,
so you just stay away from me .
you are a bad influence .
and i know i nailed that speech &apos; cause kids at school
used to say it to me all the time .
time to change your tampon ?
yep .
day two . serious flow .
killer fanny pack . where &apos;s your tribal poncho ?
ah , keep my needles in this .
you &apos;re a drug addict too ?
god . you are irresistible .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s insulin . i &apos;m a diabetic .
a diabetic pastry chef .
wow , you &apos;re even more self @-@ destructive than me .
so diabetes , how is that ?
disappointing . i put in for syphilis .
stop laughing . i have to carry 27 juices
2 blocks wearing this .
why &apos;d you let the dog lady talk to you like that ?
she &apos;s my friend , even in that shirt .
well , there goes another $ 12 .
i have spent more money dry cleaning this blouse
than i have on health care .
health care ? you mean that box of band @-@ aids
we got at the 99 cent store ?
i just have to look good tomorrow .
today was mortifying .
they called me &quot; sad dog &quot; at the juice place .
&quot; sad dog , your juices are ready . &quot;
sad dog , pick up .
can you take these to table ten ? i &apos;m backed up on the booths .
can you ? i &apos;m kind of just sitting here a minute ,
enjoying not being told what to do .
i get enough of it at that school .
look .
if you &apos;re gonna do the mother thing , do it right .
stick your hand in boiling oil or even more painful ,
binge @-@ watch shahs of sunset on bravo .
在种族传统和美国现代文化之间寻找平衡的故事
i need to talk to you in the kitchen now .
leave , someone &apos;s about to get schooled about school .
this looks like it &apos;s going to get dirty and ugly .
may i film it ?
and if so , may i then sell it on the internet ?
look . you can &apos;t just do this for me .
you &apos;re right . so we &apos;re out ?
no , we &apos;re not out ,
you said you were gonna do this for me .
i know , but you just said
i can &apos;t just do it for you ,
and i agree .
i mean , who was i kidding ?
me .
you were kidding me .
i went in there thinking i was gonna use my business skills ,
and whatever hope i had of a flirtation
with frenchie mcfrench went out the window
when he saw me wearing that t @-@ shirt that said ,
&quot; don &apos;t forget to spay and neuter me . &quot;
fine , i can quit . it &apos;s fine .
it is ? really ?
no , it &apos;s not fine .
who am i kidding ?
me . you were kidding me .
well , you &apos;ve gotta figure out something
there to keep you interested ,
because you can &apos;t go to pastry school just for me ,
and i &apos;m not gonna not go to pastry school for you .
okay . you &apos;re right , max .
of course i &apos;ll do it for you .
i just had a bad day .
i mean , we both did .
you lost your man &apos;s briefcase and your drugs ,
and i lost my dignity and a possible love interest .
surprise !
see , that &apos;s how it &apos;s supposed to go .
we got you a new book bag .
yeah , and a new chef &apos;s jacket .
and a switchblade .
yeah , &apos; cause we &apos;re not buyin &apos; another chef &apos;s jacket .
max , you know what this means ?
that i got two surprises , and you got nothing ?
no , that everything &apos;s gonna work out at that school .
i mean , in the blink of an eye ,
just like this , things can change from bad to good .
well , not totally good .
they still haven &apos;t gotten me anything .
caroline , you didn &apos;t not get anything .
here , your very own pencil case .
but no pencils . my pencil dealer got busted .
thank you , guys . i &apos;m touched .
i was not expecting it .
really ? &apos; cause you kinda bullied us all into it .
so that &apos;s a 780 on verbal ,
and a 780 on math .
and with my degree in finance ,
jackass @-@ ing around the city getting juice
could be seen as a waste of my talents .
and as the valedictorian at my graduation said--
and i &apos;m stealin &apos; from myself here ,
&quot; i &apos;ve seen the future of finance ,
and it &apos;s us . &quot;
so you want me to get the juices ?
just for today . please ?
meringue cookies are a simple way
to practice our pastry bag technique .
hm , interesting technique you got going there , chef .
dude , we gotta ditch these deadbeat partners .
i &apos;m stuck over there with grandma .
no , i &apos;m staying with the big guy next to me .
he &apos;s not gonna get me in trouble .
he never talks . get outta here .
go back to your own table , fat albert .
主角是一名黑胖子
okay .
i &apos;m going back .
and the fat albert thing was &apos; cause i &apos;m black ,
not fat , right ?
&apos;cause i go to the gym two , three times a year .
i hear talking , but no baking up front .
no , no , no , you only hear baking .
just furiously master @-@ baking up here .
the meringue needs to have nice peaks .
you are looking to make moist , pointy peaks .
i like to pinch them .
chef , seriously , man @-@ to @-@ man ,
we got a problem .
i don &apos;t think max should be stuck with that big guy .
he &apos;s not cool .
i was just over there ,
and the only pointy peaks he &apos;s interested in are hers .
talkin &apos; boobies here , chef .
chef john , chef deke here
seems to think you are sexually harassing max .
oh , please .
if i was harassing anyone , it would be you , chef .
i mean , come on .
be right back , big mary .
you know it .
where &apos;s my juice ? it &apos;s been an hour .
the mood swing elf &apos;s getting them .
look , i &apos;m coming in there to flirt with chef nicholas ,
and when i enter , i need you to say ,
&quot; caroline , you look amazing . &quot;
no .
i actually physically can &apos;t say that .
i would rather walk in there and yell ,
&quot; i have crabs , and three of them just escaped . &quot;
call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 . call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
something &apos;s happened to the adorable mixed @-@ race one .
deke ?
he &apos;s diabetic . he needs insulin .
has anyone here ever administered a needle ?
uh , administer means the same thing as &quot; shove it in , &quot; right ?
good , good , good , max . come , come , come .
okay , uh , his syringes are in his fanny pack .
i &apos;ve actually never done this
without iron maiden playing in the background ,
but i &apos;ll give it a shot .
just put it anywhere in my hot bod .
god help us .
oh , i hate needles . i can &apos;t look .
get it together , ladies .
this is why i &apos;m not allowed to hold babies .
max , i think you and deke should be lab partners from now on
in case something like this happens again .
is that okay ?
i guess if i have to .
max ?
i guess if i have to .
what , did you not take your insulin on purpose ?
i really wanted to be your partner .
bebe , i can &apos;t find a chef jacket anywhere in here .
and i &apos;m sorry , i know i &apos;m not supposed to wear one ,
but i &apos;m really cold ,
and i can &apos;t walk around like this all day .
maybe i can help .
you can &apos;t stand there wet and cold .
take my jacket .
oh , no , no , no .
you don &apos;t have-- oh , that &apos;ll work .
i &apos;m sorry about the no shirt under ,
but i just get so hot when i &apos;m teaching .
yeah , hot . so hot .
oh mon dieu .
i was just giving it to caroline .
i mean , she needs something to wear ,
and--and now , she has it .
chef , i will see you later .
caroline .
max , i think i found something to keep me interested .
this is weird . so i &apos;m the good student now ?
and you &apos;re the one sleeping with the teacher ?
we &apos;re not sleeping together .
why ? do you think he wants to ?
i don &apos;t know , but you better hurry it up
before big mary gets him .
