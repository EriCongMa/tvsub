here we go .
peter .
that &apos;s sam &apos;s favorite male nurse .
he &apos;s gotten him two years in a row for secret santa ,
and last year he got him $ 500,
and this year , he got him crayons .
all over the map , that peter .
so , when you get to sam &apos;s birthday party , is the goal
to impress his friends with how much you know about them
or to terrify them ?
i just want them to like me .
finally ,
i feel like i &apos;m in an adult relationship .
he &apos;s a grown @-@ up .
hey , jess , heads up , i borrowed your towel .
use your own towel if you &apos;re gonna shower .
no , i didn &apos;t shower , i just sponged off .
that &apos;s even worse .
you didn &apos;t even get clean before you used the towel .
it &apos;s called a french whore &apos;s bath .
you wouldn &apos;t make a dime as a french whore .
you would make zero dollars .
i &apos;d make millions , millions .
bonjour .
croissant . millions .
definitely not .
no .
that &apos;s disrespectful , here .
happy bird day , dr. sam .
wow , you didn &apos;t have to do that .
did you say , &quot; bird day &quot; ?
you heard me .
well , you know , i figured jess likes you so
i like you , too , man .
welcome to the family .
h @-@ h @-@ hey , look at that ,
it &apos;s a shirt with a whole lot of birds on it .
that &apos;s a bird shirt .
bird shirt ...

ah , you know why .

we &apos;re bird bros now ...
and check it out , you can wear it to the party .
you know , nothing says , &quot; this dude is dope , &quot;
like a motherflippin &apos; finch , am i right ?
sam , i &apos;m so sorry i won &apos;t be able to attend your party .
i have wedding stuff .
&quot; stuff &quot; ?
define &quot; stuff . &quot;
things .
thank you .
i &apos;m so excited to meet your friends ,
including dr. garfinkel ...
sam , i love the way you laugh .
you never open your mouth .
you &apos;re always like ...
i don &apos;t sound like that .
no , you do . you just did it .
hey , you got to add a flash card .
my friend diane &apos;s coming .
she &apos;s in town for a podiatry conference .
she &apos;s a friend from med school .
oh , i &apos;ve never heard you mention her .
you guys close ?
diane !
hi .
they look ... close .
hi ! it &apos;s so good to see you .
so good to see you .
way too close .
hey , schmidt , how many robots are too many robots ?
hi , nick .
gavin .
what are you doing here ?
i thought you &apos;d be at sam &apos;s party .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
well , after the incident where my dad kissed ...
if you &apos;re gonna barf , just barf . it &apos;s not healthy to hold it in .
... where my dad kissed jess ,
there was an accidental pocket dial
that actually went pretty well .
he suggested some wine tasting for the wedding ,
and i said , &quot; why not ? &quot;
you &apos;re just gonna drink alone with your dad ?
join us , nick ,
the pinot from my vineyard is dynamite this year .
it &apos;s gonna taste fantastic at my son &apos;s wedding in a factory .
gavin , it &apos;s actually a slaughterhouse ,
and you would know that if you were around more .
can i see you in my room for a second , please ?
look , i know you don &apos;t trust my dad ,
but i &apos;m happy that he &apos;s here .
we &apos;re working through stuff .
wait , schmidt , i want you to have
a relationship with your father .
i really do , but i &apos;ve been down this road so many times .
he just shows up out of the boo ,
and then all of a sudden expects ...
it &apos;s blue , it &apos;s blue .
well , thanks , eye @-@ stein .
he shows you a great time ,
you get sucked in ,
then he disappears and breaks your heart ,
and i &apos;m left to pick up the pieces .
my dad &apos;s taking me to ... miss saigon tonight !
and i &apos;m not gonna get hurt .
my dad never showed up .
he didn &apos;t ?
it hurts so bad !
you want a milkshake , cowboy ?
it &apos;s different now .
i &apos;ve heard that before .
we &apos;re seeing jersey boys !
wait , this is your dad we &apos;re talking about .
and he &apos;s different now , nick .
he &apos;s the same !
i didn &apos;t have ice cream ,
so i just really shook up some milk .
i &apos;m older and i &apos;m wiser ...
and i &apos;m not gonna get sucked in .
we &apos;re gonna taste some wine ,
and then i &apos;m gonna send him on his way ,
but , nick , i &apos;m plead ... i &apos;m asking you ...
just be nice to him .
all right , man , i will .
if it means that much to you , of course , i &apos;ll do it ...
thank you .
... but if it goes poorly ,
i &apos;m not putting humpty dumpty back together again .
am i humpty dumpty ?
yeah . i &apos;m just not doing it again .
you won &apos;t have to .
also , nowhere in that rhyme does it say he &apos;s an egg .
he &apos;s most definitely an egg , nick .
so , what kind of king uses all those resources
to put together one egg ?
it &apos;s a parable .
humpty dumpty is the king .
who told you that ?
i &apos;ve never seen him laugh like that .
what do i do ?
think of it this way : you &apos;re a dog ,
he &apos;s a fire hydrant , you pee on him , girl .
yeah .
there you go .
i &apos;m gonna go lift a leg on him .
there you go !
so ... sam said he spilled on the bird shirt
and he had to take it off .
he &apos;s putting on a brave face , but
poor thing , i know he is just crushed .
babe .
what , babe ?
he doesn &apos;t like the shirt .
no , babe .
yeah , babe .
no , babe .
yeah , babe .
no ... babe .
yeah ... babe .
no , babe .
yeah , babe .
no ... babe .
yeah ... babe .
no .
yeah .
babe .
sam , do you remember in med school
when we got drunk and sewed fins on that dead guy ?
we made a merman !
hey , sam , remember the other night
when you ate all that bad crab and , uh , you said ,
&quot; not tonight , &quot; and i said , &quot; yeah , tonight , &quot;
and then you said ,
&quot; no , not tonight , &quot;
and then the next night
when you were feeling better ...
remember what we did ?
we ... we ...
had sex ? had sex !
the kind where you need a snack after .
hey @-@ o !
so , jess , you &apos;re from portland .
do you , do you miss it ?
do you miss portland ?
i mean , i feel like you never really ...
you ... are you okay ?
oh , my god , are you choking ?
is that what this is ?
oh , my god , stand up !
stand up , stand up !
get up , come here .
here , sit down .
thank you , diane .
you saved me .
any time .
um , hey , diane , um ,
would you like to go to the ladies room and freshen up ?
yes , jess , i would love to .
i am so sorry .
i &apos;m really ... i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m embarrassed .
please , for what ?
no , i am .
for marking your territory ? look , i get it .
but i was acting childish
and dumb and jealous ,
and @-@ and i ...
i see why sam likes you .
well , i see why he likes you , too .
will you forgive me ?
i have guy friends , and i don &apos;t know why
i would just assume that you &apos;re wildly in love with him .
oh , no , i am .
no , really , i am .
seriously , i am .
jess , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m in love with sam .
oh , balls .
now this varietal gained prominence
in the &apos; 30s as an italian driving wine .
now they call it a picnic wine ,
but we know what they &apos;re up to ,
but as they say ,
&quot; wine is fine ,
but bourbon is schwervin &apos; . &quot;
i think i got a buzz .
yeah , me too .
hang on , uh ,
you &apos;re gonna like this .
how much hooch do you have stored in this place ,
you mountain person ?
prohibition happened once ...
it can happen again .
yeah .
it was pretty easy to see where you were going with that .
look at the two of you .
bonding over the thing that numbs you .
smell this .
smell this .
oh ! let me get a whiff .
let me get a whiff .
hurts so good .
sam .
guess who the luckiest boy in the world is ?
it &apos;s you .
it &apos;s an extra bird shirt , huh ?
i keep an extra one in my car ,
just in case i get interviewed on television .
oh . thank you .
put on the bird shirt , sam .
i will .
when ?
when i don &apos;t have to take my other shirt off
in a bar full of people .
ten years ? !
yeah .
you didn &apos;t tell him for ten years ?
i did .
well , i tried to .
um , our second year of med school ,
he went to work with doctors without borders .
well , so i didn &apos;t @-@ i didn &apos;t know when i was gonna see him again ,
and , um , one night i @-@ i just sat down and wrote him a letter ,
and everything came out , you know ,
everything that i was feeling ,
everything that i had been holding back .
yeah ... i love letters .
i know , me too .
we have so much in common ,
arguably too much ...
mm . ... but keep going .
well ... sam never responded .
i just figured he didn &apos;t want to embarrass me , you know ?
i mean , i @-@ it &apos;s hard when you &apos;re friends with a guy first .
so ...
he came home , and we just kept on like normal ,
and it was really painful ,
but i @-@ i couldn &apos;t lose him as a friend .
of course you couldn &apos;t .
then ... last week this came in the mail .
return to sender .
he never got it .
oh , my god .
yeah .
he never knew how you felt .
no , and i @-@ i came here tonight to give him this letter and then ...
what happened ?
... i met you .
right .
me .
here ... i can &apos;t throw it away ,
but i can &apos;t give it to him .
don &apos;t worry , jess , you ...
you didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
i &apos;m not the one for sam .
you are .
i &apos;m gonna be really honest , um ,
i &apos;m having a @-@ a very hard time
rooting for myself right now .
that was the most romantic story i &apos;ve ever heard .
and i don &apos;t want to get between them .
or do i ?
i love sam ,
and i don &apos;t want to throw it all away
because she couldn &apos;t figure out
how to buy a forever stamp .
just because you give sam this letter , it does not mean
that he &apos;s automatically gonna choose diane .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
damn it .
look at them .
* moon river *
* wider than a mile *
* i &apos;m crossing you in style ... *
this song isn &apos;t even on our jukebox .
you know what , that &apos;s it !
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not losing sam
because i &apos;m some dumb romantic .
cece , get rid of this letter .
letter done .
good @-@ bye , diane .
go back to fixing feet ,
you sweet saint of a woman .
you must be so proud of me .
i &apos;m finally being practical
and realistic , and not some moony @-@ eyed freak
who &apos;s seen too many romantic comedies .
i &apos;m basically being you .
not anymore , pal .
schmidt &apos;s made me weak in my stupid knees .
i don &apos;t know .
this past year with schmidt &apos;s changed me .
it &apos;s made me believe in love stories .
is that why you were crying during the bank commercial
where the two old people were texting each other ?
jessica ...
i know .
they now have the money that they need ...
no , i know .
... to be buried together .
we both know that you &apos;re not gonna be able
to live with yourself if you don &apos;t give this letter to sam .
yeah .
what if i lose him ?
well , then you &apos;ll at least know , babe ,
it &apos;s not your love story .
i have something to tell you .
the old man in the bank commercial ...
um , played a nazi in schindler &apos;s list .
does that change anything ?
i made a model of our wedding venue .
your wine is so good , i really want to showcase it
and @-@ and put the bar here .
it &apos;s where they store the drums of wild chemicals ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure they &apos;re empty now .
yeah , it &apos;s empty except for
the big puddle that never dries .
oh , it &apos;ll be fine .
with your mother there ,
that puddle &apos;ll get drunk .
how about we grab some dinner ?
together ?
you ...
yeah , no , i &apos;d like that very much .
i &apos;m gonna run home .
obviously , i can &apos;t wear these shoes to dinner .
ha , can you imagine ?
i &apos;ll see you .
i &apos;m going to dinner with my dad .
this is so great , man .
yeah , it &apos;s great .
‭ you guys are finally getting along . ‬
you were like , &quot; we &apos;ve been down this road . &quot;
it &apos;s great . i just want to check in .
y @-@ you said you weren &apos;t gonna get sucked in ,
and it seems like you &apos;re getting sucked in .
i &apos;m not getting sucked in , i &apos;m not getting sucked in .
if anybody &apos;s getting sucked ,
it &apos;s just me sucking myself in .
no , i know how that sounded ...
yeah .
... but you , i mean you ...
you good ?
yeah .
yeah . ‬
hey , uh , gavin , hold up .
i feel like i can say this to you because , well ,
you know , we shared a cup .
you really live by a specific code .
look , we both know
how this is gonna go down , gavin .
you &apos;re gonna get schmidt &apos;s expectations up ,
and then you &apos;re gonna bail .
i know .
just be better .
be his dad .
just be there for him , even when it &apos;s not fun ,
and sometimes it &apos;s really not fun .
i know .
i &apos;ve been doing it for 15 years .
thank you .
don &apos;t thank me . ‬
just promise me if you show up for dinner tonight ,
you &apos;ll show up tomorrow and the day after and the week after ,
and basically forever .
i will be there .
will you , gavin ?
will you ?
will you , gavin ?
i will .
will you ?
will you , gavin ?
you &apos;re really dragging this out .
no , i &apos;ve already gone through everything i had rehearsed .
i really thought the elevator would be here by now .
we could talk about other stuff .
can we , gavin ?
can we ?
yeah .
can we , gavin ? oh , thank god .
i &apos;m getting my birthday present at an airport hotel ?
oh , my god , are you taking me
on a trip to meet my birth mother ?
‭ oh ... no , wait . ‬
um ... no .
uh , it &apos;s , uh , i have a surprise for you ,
but it &apos;s not exactly a present .
um , just wait here .
okay .
look , i want you to know that no matter what happens ,
no @-@ no matter how this turns out--
and by this ,
you &apos;ll @-@ you &apos;ll see what i &apos;m talking about--
i want you to be happy .
and i want you to be happy ,
but what did you want me to be before this moment ?
don &apos;t let me get a ticket , okay ?
jess ?
tell sam .
he @-@ he deserves to know how you feel .
wow , you are either really cool or really cocky .
you are either really cool or really cocky .
thank you .
i should &apos;ve been more clear-- he &apos;s downstairs .
i just want to let you know , my shift is up ,
so jason will be getting bummed out by you
for the rest of the night .
somebody order a milkshake , cowboy ?
well , nick , you were right .
i got sucked in .
he was a car wash vacuum ,
and i was just a stray pistachio .
listen , schmidt , it &apos;s my fault .
i got real with him
and he split .
it &apos;s not your fault .
you didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
and , nick ?
yeah ?
thank you .
thanks for what ?
for being there .

yeah . ‬
let &apos;s get out of here .
let &apos;s get out of here .
oh , don &apos;t , don &apos;t , dont !
wait ! wait , guys , wait .
i know i should have been here an hour ago ,
but i was at the warehouse
getting your security deposit back .
why would you ...
let me finish , trust me .
that slumlord wouldn &apos;t give it to me
unless i cleaned the place ,
and once i started ...
i don &apos;t know if you know , but i &apos;m a little ocd .
me , too .
yeah , it runs in the family .
your grandfather had to touch
every lamppost he passed .
he couldn &apos;t hold a job
until he got a job
as a lamppost repair man .
why wouldn &apos;t you just call ?
oh , i got kicked in the back of the head
by some kids who were using that dump as a place
to practice their urban dancing , they ...
they were honestly pretty good ,
until they beat me and took my phone ...
and my wallet ...
and my watch .
i had to run over here-- well , actually
it was ... it was more of a ...
a walk @-@ jog .
i threw up once .
i &apos;m not very good at doing the right thing
when it comes to you ...
... but i wanted to start tonight .
you are not getting married
at that slaughterhouse .
okay , well then where am i getting married ?
at my vineyard .
if you want .
it &apos;ll be beautiful .
i talked to cece .
she said it &apos;s up to you .
i just want you to know , either way ,
i &apos;m all in from here on out .
i &apos;m getting married at a vineyard .
yes !
yes .
i &apos;m getting married at a vineyard .
yes .
yes , yes .
so , you just left him there to talk ?
yep , i abandoned my own car ,
and now for all i know ,
sam and diane are tearing apart
a business @-@ friendly hotel room together .
well , i &apos;m really proud of you .
i know that it was hard , but it &apos;s the only way
you &apos;re gonna find out what you need to know .
thanks .
this might sound like a cry for help ,
but i promise you it &apos;s not ;
um , i &apos;m gonna go to my room and i &apos;m gonna watch videos
of dogs waiting for their dead owners to come back .
cece , you want to know what i think ?
mm , not really .
i think there are people who get bird shirts ,
and there are people who don &apos;t .
jessica day needs to be with a bird shirt person .
am i a bird shirt person ?
oh , cece , why do you always have to make things about you ?
sam , hello .
i forgive you .
okay ... okay .
is jess here ?
she is .
i &apos;m just , uh ...
yeah , i &apos;m really nervous ,
so i &apos;m just gonna ask you an innocuous question .
um ... did you bring my car back ?
yes , i have got your keys right here .
thanks .
look , what you did for me today was ...
the most selfless thing
anyone has ever done for me .
whatever ...
if there was ever a time for me and diane ,
it &apos;s passed .
and when i read the letter ,
it just reminded me ,
how much that &apos;s true .
now that i know you like letters ,
watch out .
i have to say ,
that was the strangest birthday surprise i have ever been given .
well , winston tosok my bird shirt idea , so ...
you know what , one of these days ,
i &apos;m gonna get you to laugh with your mouth open .
i know you will .
that &apos;s what she said .
no , that &apos;s not gonna do it .
that &apos;s what she said .
you just said the same thing .
now that &apos;s what she said .
that &apos;s ... what accent is that ?
it &apos;s italian .
oh , really ?
that &apos;s what she said !
that &apos;s what she said !
nope , that didn &apos;t .
now you &apos;re just changing the stress .
that &apos;s what she said ?
maybe you should stop .
that &apos;s what she said ?
that was closer .
