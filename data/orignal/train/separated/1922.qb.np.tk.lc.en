&quot; you be illin &quot;
i could print a scaffolding and --
and make a biological conduit for a baby &apos;s heart .
they &apos;re not even doing that yet .
dr. yang hit a home run .
thanks to her , baby nathan is thriving .
an e @-@ mail from the harper avery foundation .
what ?
you &apos;re in consideration for this year &apos;s award .
we ...
we are married .
we did something that wasn &apos;t responsible .
but we did it because we love each other ,
and we want to spend every day together .
emma marling and owen are through .
i don &apos;t think it was her idea .
hopkins wants me !
did they throw in a loan @-@ repayment package
or moving expenses ?
we don &apos;t have the dough , okay ?
i &apos;m postponing hopkins till robbins is better .
it &apos;s beautiful !
and it &apos;s gonna be ours !
i &apos;d like to appoint you director of the residency program .
you &apos;d be in charge of all the decisions
regarding the educational arm of this hospital .
meredith , when the president of the united states
calls you on the phone , you can &apos;t say no to the guy .
you went back on your promise .
you say that you work so hard to change ,
to become this new person , but then you do this ?
she attacked me . jo &apos;s a lunatic .
damn it !
the average person touches their face
about 18 times every waking hour .
that leaves you susceptible
to infection about 100 times a day .
well ... bless you , sweetie .
infection has a nasty habit
of taking advantage of our everyday behaviors .
okay , i &apos;m gonna call dr. lebackes
and move up our anoplasty
because i &apos;m gonna be sick this afternoon .
what are you , psychic ?
no , i felt it -- you know , the sick .
a kid sneezed on me . i felt it go in .
it looked around , and it sat down .
what , you felt that ?
yes , i &apos;ve been doing this a while .
you start to develop a sense .
i &apos;ve got seven hours , tops .
it spreads by touching doors , desks ...
so let &apos;s just cancel .
no .
1 in 5,000 babies is born without --
without a butthole , right .
with a birth defect resulting in an imperforate anus .
alex , you need to learn this .
well , fine .
but do i have to learn it from dr. butthole ?
don &apos;t call him that .
dr. lebackes is a great pediatric surgeon
who specializes in anoplasty .
and you haven &apos;t even met him yet .
oh , i know him .
these private @-@ practice docs
are only about seeing how much they can charge .
hey , cancel tomorrow &apos;s procedures , okay ?
why ?
because i will be sick .
okay , i &apos;ll page you when i get a time from lebackes .
just tell me with your mind .
uh @-@ huh .
... elevator buttons ,
pens ,
sharing cups .
i found these payment books in a stack of mail .
these are for your student loans .
yeah ? what about them ?
have you looked at them ?
you have to do something with these .
you &apos;re right . let me see them .
... even money .
all we can do is try our best to prevent it from spreading .
we &apos;ll only be like 15 minutes late .
oh , we wouldn &apos;t be late at all
if you just put the key on the hook .
i put it by the door so you would always know
where it is .
i know the hook . i play with the hook .
i &apos;m not a hook guy . - oh , real-- i &apos;m not a --
huh ? i &apos;m not a can &apos;t @-@ find @-@ my @-@ keys kind of girl .
mm @-@ hmm . that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying , though , right ?
what ? you do you , and i do me .
okay .
well , your you makes me late for our work .
well ...
because once it &apos;s out there , the infection usually wins .
there is a viral infection
running rampant through this hospital .
it feels like flu symptoms , then g.i. stuff .
it goes without saying that soap , water , -oh , sorry . sorry .
and hand sanitizer are your best friends .
and if you do feel sick and you can go home ,
then go home .
spread the word . that &apos;s all for now .
blow , honey , and stop picking at your face .
mom , i can blow my own nose . i &apos;m practically a tween .
hi , i &apos;m dr. kepner . are you braden ?
yes , this is our little brady bug .
mom !
so , did you speak to our doctor ?
i did . he said braden has s.c.i.d.
bubble boy disease .
braden .
he knows that we hate it when he calls it that .
and he sent you here ?
yes , he &apos;s out of the country , s--
right , but patients with
severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome
are generally advised to steer clear
of high @-@ risk infection areas like a hospital .
without an immune system --
we know , even a common cold can be life @-@ threatening .
well , he &apos;s on enzyme injections ,
and they &apos;ve been working very well .
and we were just so worried and -- braden . face .
i &apos;m not picking at it . just touching it .
braden , how long have you had that ?
this zit ? i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m just gonna keep an eye on it , okay ?
geez , why not just draw an arrow and the word &quot; zit &quot; ?
braden !
last night , he got congested ,
and we thought he might be getting a sinus infection ,
so we called our doctor .
and he sent you here to get i.v.i.g. antibiotics and labs .
great . let &apos;s get him started .
stop touching your face ! - stop touching your face !
ross , you &apos;re on cardio . wilson , neuro .
edwards , you &apos;re on general with me and grey --
crohn &apos;s perforation .
yes !
uh , warren , pit .
out sick .
uh , campbell .
oh , campbell &apos;s out sick , too .
a third of us are down with a stomach @-@ bug thing .
actually , sir , i &apos;m going home sick .
murphy , doctors aren &apos;t sick . patients are sick .
that &apos;s why there are doctors .
look , unspoken rule , people --
surgeon stays home , patient suffers ,
as well as the doctors who have to cover for you .
you don &apos;t stay home .
you push through .
all right .
wilson , pit .
edwards , neuro .
murphy , you &apos;re with me and grey . let &apos;s go .
yes , sir .
if it &apos;s an unspoken rule ,
then why did he just tell us about it ?
oh , you &apos;re just pissed &apos; cause you already lost the bet .
what bet ?
the bet wherein the first one of us
to fall due to illness today
has to be swap monkey for a week .
what &apos;s swap monkey ?
all next week , one of us doesn &apos;t like our service ,
we can trade with the swap monkey ,
and they can &apos;t refuse .
you just made this up .
well , that doesn &apos;t make it any less amazing . yeah .
i &apos;m in .
getting sick isn &apos;t even an option for me .
it &apos;s a huge day for the conduit trial .
i can &apos;t lose .
no , you &apos;re right .
you can &apos;t lose because leah already did !
i did not lose . i am not going down .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s gonna be ...
oh , god .
where is she going ?
bathroom .
dead man walking !
hey !
hey .
excuse me .
sorry ?
i &apos;ve been waiting a long time .
oh , uh , i see .
thank you for your patience .
no , no , this isn &apos;t patience . i can &apos;t move my mouth .
say what ?
he says he &apos;s a dummy who cut himself composting
and refused to get a tetanus shot or get it cleaned .
i &apos;m his brother , abraham .
logan , they didn &apos;t have coconut water .
all they had was soda .
no !
that stuff &apos;s poison . get out of here .
there it is . everything &apos;s poison .
this looks like risus sardonicus ,
causing your muscles to tighten .
and with a cut like that , tetanus is more than likely .
so i &apos;m gonna re @-@ clean the wound ,
and i strongly suggest
tetanus toxoid and immunoglobulin .
see , buddy ?
you take the meds , we get out of here ,
and you can get right back to suckling mother nature &apos;s teat .
no , it &apos;s poison .
i can assure you that it isn &apos;t .
poison !
you want to hit him , or can i ?
ivy mcneil , 15 , end @-@ stage heart failure
due to dilated cardiomyopathy .
she &apos;s been on the transplant list
for approximately four months .
until today , right ?
looks like it .
the donor &apos;s heart &apos;s being evaluated right now ,
and if all goes well , we should be taking you up soon .
i don &apos;t believe it .
where are the rest of you ?
it &apos;s usually much noisier . i know .
ivy &apos;s little sister caught the flu bug that &apos;s going around ,
so jon &apos;s home with her and link .
they tell you in those counseling sessions
not to get your hopes up . do you really think --
i saw the report on the heart ,
and i have a very good feeling .
yay .
yay !
yay !
crap .
crap . i know .
hey , what &apos;s wrong ?
a donor heart just showed up for my cardiomyopathy kid .
help me out with why that &apos;s bad .
it &apos;s just bad timing .
today &apos;s day 30 of recovery
for our conduit trial patients --
the last day for our report to the n.i.h. ,
which will inform your harper avery consideration .
i -- you said that . i didn &apos;t . but yes .
i plan on spending all day with the conduit kids
to ensure we end up with the most optimal results .
and instead , you have to save the life of a little girl .
that sucks .
oh , i know .
oh , you &apos;re being facetious .
yeah .
he &apos;s right .
and it would be nice to get back into the o.r. , won &apos;t it ?
oh , no .
yes . you stay with the trial patients .
keep them safe and warm .
today &apos;s numbers have got to be the best they &apos;ve ever been .
there are nurses that can --
shane , there &apos;s a bug going around this hospital .
if one of those patients &apos; conduits gets infected ,
the trial dies .
i &apos;ll join you when i &apos;m done .
this trial is my baby , shane .
don &apos;t let my baby die .
poor guy conked out .
hey , champ . doctor &apos;s here .
hey , braden , you feeling any better ?
i don &apos;t know . still a little stuffy .
but ... yeah , maybe a little better .
okay , braden , we &apos;re gonna move you
to someplace a little more comfy , okay ?
we need to move my patient into isolation right now .
so every time you go into braden &apos;s room ,
you will put on a fresh gown , gloves , and mask .
right . every time . yeah .
the lump on braden &apos;s head is a rapidly growing infection .
we just want to make sure he doesn &apos;t get any more .
but he &apos;s been taking the enzyme .
it &apos;s supposed to stop this kind of thing from happening .
his labs show his t @-@ cell count is zero ,
which means he &apos;s developed antibodies to the enzyme
and it &apos;s no longer working .
he &apos;s highly susceptible to all types of infection .
have you considered a bone @-@ marrow transplant ?
we tried to find the match right after he was born ,
but ethnic donors are so hard to find .
they recommended the enzyme instead .
it &apos;s been working .
it was working .
you ready ?
i &apos;m ready .
hey , champ . brady bug !
hi , sweetie . ohh .
mom .
ohh . baby .
yeah , this is a u.s. project , but i believe our --
our best approach is to open our doors
to welcome your participation .
you know , we &apos;re trying to gain a comprehensive understanding
of the most complex object in the world -- our brain .
we are willing to take every great mind
we can access to do it -- your minds .
we welcome you .
thank you for joining us .
that was great . you did a good job .
i went up to daycare to find my son missing .
yeah , i needed an audience . look , sit down .
let me go over this again with you , okay ?
oh , no , no , no .
i &apos;ve heard that speech so many times i could do it myself .
stop boring our son .
is it boring ?
i have 50 scientists
from around the world coming here today .
it &apos;s got to be charming . it &apos;s a big deal .
i know it &apos;s a big deal ,
which is why i will get out of your way .
and i &apos;m taking my son with me because
i don &apos;t want his first word to be hypothalamus .
there are worse first words .
thank you .
good news .
the heart checked out okay and is en route .
time to go to the o.r.
thank god .
mom , you &apos;ll call dad ?

no , no , this is her superpower .
she looks fine now , but -- - she is fine .
no , i &apos;m thinking it &apos;s gonna be about three days .
so you know what ?
you should cancel dinner with pam and them , too .
oh , no , can you call ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t even have a resident today ,
and everyone &apos;s out with the plague , so ...
speaking of canceling ,
are you sure dr. butthole &apos;s gonna be here ?
he &apos;s already late .
dr. butthole has arrived .
i get that a lot .
also , dr. poop chute , dr. rear gear , dr. rump chump .
but my favorite -- the sphincter fairy .
my friends call me oliver ,
and you look radiant , as always .
oh , it &apos;s really nice to see you , ollie .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t -- i @-@ i @-@ i wasn &apos;t --
oh , no offense taken .
i &apos;ll just cry myself to sleep tonight
on my piles and piles of money .
we ready ?
yes . let &apos;s go .
hey , braden morris is here ?
he was my patient a few years ago .
what &apos;s going on ?
his meds stopped working .
he &apos;s got acute frontal sinusitis .
it &apos;s spreading fast .
well , it &apos;s a potts puffy tumor .
he should get to surgery right away , get it drained .
make sure it doesn &apos;t spread and --
you look horrible .
yeah , correct . you look horrible .
what &apos;s going on with you ?
oh , nothing .
it &apos;s -- my stomach &apos;s a little screwy . i &apos;m fine .
gonna , um , go book an o.r. , though .
no , you &apos;re not .
the best thing you can do for this kid
is to be nowhere near him .
because you look horrible .
yeah , i can drain a potts puffy tumor .
go home .
yeah , you should go home .
you need to -- - i &apos;m fine .
okay ? i can take care of myself .
maybe i will .
yes , you should go home ,
put on some good , fluffy socks .
oh , there &apos;s soup in the pantry ,
and just go get in the shower and sit in it to --
april ! i know how to be sick .
i &apos;m not even sick .
just trying to help him .
well , let &apos;s go help him .
mr. gorder , your labs look great and your ekg is clear ,
so we &apos;re gonna be sending you
up to the o.r. in a little bit , okay ?
yeah , sounds good .
uh , nervous ?
a little bit , yeah .
how about if dr. murphy
takes you through the procedure one more time ?
murphy ?
uh , she might be asleep .
she &apos;s not asleep .
yeah , no , no .
i ... was just going over your case in my head ,
and now i &apos;ll go over it with you .
you have a walled @-@ off abcess .
so we &apos;ll clean out the puss
and , um , resect a portion of your bowel .
and i &apos;ll still be able to poop just fine ?
yes , sir .
that &apos;s the plan .
just call all the colleges .
see if anybody there can speak it .
right away , dr. shepherd .
are you okay ?
uh , if you can speak estonian .
my translator called in sick .
you don &apos;t look good . are you getting this thing ?
i don &apos;t get sick . it &apos;s an unspoken rule .
spoken . twice today .
yeah , well , even if i were gonna get sick ,
it &apos;s not gonna happen today .
murphy , you look awful .
i &apos;m pushing through .
you know , get away from me .
oh , wow . he &apos;s here .

gerhardt strauss is coming to your thing ?
i told you , meredith , it &apos;s a big deal .
dr. derek shepherd .
it is a pleasure to meet you .
dr. strauss . pleasure &apos;s all mine .
uh , thank you for coming .
i was , uh , intrigued , shepherd .
your project was the talk of the e.u. neuroscience conference .
mostly , people were wondering whether it was a serious effort
or just a p.r. stunt for your president .
well , you &apos;ll fell more confident after the presentation .
well , i have no doubt that you will charm and dazzle us .
i just hope that it is not a big , um ...
what is the phrase you use ?
hype ?
no , no , no , no , no , no .
flash over substance ?
no , no , no , no , no . um , uh , com--
complete waste of my time .
yes .
i look forward to it .
oh , good .
sure you feel okay ?
98.9 .
you &apos;re clear .
next .
is this really necessary ?
whoa . 100.7 .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t let you in .
that &apos;s barely a fever .
ma &apos;am , your daughter &apos;s trying
to heal from her conduit surgery .
we don &apos;t want anything to interfere with that , right ?
rest up . lots of fluids .
excuse me .
oh , get away from here .
no , come on . the pit &apos;s a hot zone .
if i stay down there , i &apos;m gonna get sick . come on .
okay , you should go home .
no , i &apos;m pushing through .
well , push through somewhere else .
you &apos;re too close to my patients .
and you have a sheen .
oh , are you enjoying that coffee ?
because i did when i took a big sip of it
in the lounge this morning .
you didn &apos;t .
did i ?
i don &apos;t like this at all .
his abdomen &apos;s rigid . he &apos;s feverish .
sir , it &apos;s your choice not to accept the tetanus toxoid ,
but you should know that full @-@ blown tetanus can kill you .
your respiratory muscles will spasm .
you won &apos;t be able to breathe .
you &apos;re a tear @-@ donger !
here we go .
what did he call me ?
a fear @-@ monger .
he thinks big pharma lay on scary statistics
in order to get people to buy in to their poisons .
they do .
i am not big pharma .
i am your doctor , and i &apos;m trying --
you &apos;re their hut @-@ hett .
what ? !
i am nobody &apos;s puppet !
and i &apos;m trying to keep you from getting sicker
than you &apos;ve already made yourself , so --
oh , my god ! okay , okay .
logan , i &apos;m running out of ways of saying , &quot; i told you so . &quot;
i got you . oh , my god !
oh , my god ! oh , god !
oh , my god ! ohh , god !
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
you know , they teach dr. lebackes &apos; technique
in med school now .
dr. robbins , you &apos;re making me blush .
everyone has to have a specialty , right ?
and everybody has to poop .
do you always listen to music like this during surgery ?
anything with a beat .
we spend enough time here at work .
it ought to be fun , right ?
and the &apos; 80s were nothing if not fun .
hemoclip !
i know this is old hat for you , oliver ,
but dr. karev &apos;s never seen this procedure firsthand .
you want to walk him through it ?
oh , god . i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , uh , kill the music , will you ?
uh , no , it &apos;s cool .
it looks like you used a posterior sagittal approach ,
and then divided the parasagittal fibers in the midline .
i &apos;m guessing you &apos;ll open the levator muscle next ?
boy wonder knows his stuff .
you think i &apos;m the only one with a nickname around here ?
all right . here we go .
you want me to put the entire unit on lockdown ...
yes .
... because of the flu .
yes .
no .
all due respect , dr. yang left me in charge .
that &apos;s cute . listen , i &apos;m in charge of the ccu .
you &apos;re in charge of three patients .
three very important patients who need protection from the --
i &apos;m not done .
you can put your patients in pod 3,
then you can institute whatever kind of lockdown
makes your little heart sing .
i have no nurses to spare , so you &apos;re on your own .
now i &apos;m done .
you should get that looked at .
oh , man , that is a nasty break .
you see this ?
he has an old fracture that never healed properly .
see how it &apos;s mal @-@ aligned ?
left the bone weaker than it should have been .
wilson ?
i think that this is my fault .
the guy was getting to me and i was pissed
and then i was just trying to restrain him and i --
you think you broke his arm ?
wilson , don &apos;t flatter yourself .
tetanus spasms can be so intense .
they &apos;ve been known to over @-@ torque and snap bones .
he broke his own arm ?
but we &apos;re not gonna be able to realign the new break
without re @-@ breaking the old fracture .
so you have to break his bone
in order to put it back together again ?
no .
i think you do .
i can &apos;t do that .
you thought you could a second ago .
what &apos;s so wrong with wanting to help somebody ?
it &apos;s our profession , for god &apos;s sake .
well , if the man doesn &apos;t want help ...
he &apos;s not a goat !
no , he is not .
boy , is he not .
he doesn &apos;t need to separate from the flock
and crawl to the back of the barn
to tough it out by himself .
i want to help .
then welcome to your next 30 years .
what do you mean ?
you &apos;re gonna want to help him .
he &apos;s going to want to help himself .
neither of you is going to change .
get used to this argument .
might as well just let him suffer ?
if that &apos;s what he wants ,
go get a pedicure and count your blessings .
look , there &apos;s two kinds of man sick --
the jackson kind and the ben warren kind .
now , when i get home tonight , dr. ben warren
will call out &quot; miranda &quot; from his fetal position
on the couch and beg me for saltines
and a wet washcloth for his head .
jackson &apos;s crawl @-@ away @-@ like @-@ a @-@ goat kind is the good one .
oh , god , look .
it &apos;s cerebral spinal fluid .
ohh , the abscess has penetrated into his brain since the c.t.
we &apos;re gonna have to call dr. shepherd .
yeah .
whether you believe , uh ,
that this ultrastructural analysis is made of ...
... physiological experiment or a computer algorithm ,
it &apos;s safe to say that we can all agree
that the neuro ... circuits are the key to ...
thought and ... action .
what are you eating ?
uh , onion rings . do you want some ?
take them outside ... of the building .
i do believe that this is --
dr. shepherd , you &apos;re needed in o.r. 2 .
dr. b -- - i am not on call today .
nelson is .
nelson &apos;s out sick with the stomach flu .
then get ahold of , uh -- - garrison and anders , too .
you &apos;re the only one who &apos;s still not sick .
unless you are .
i don &apos;t get sick .
headache as well .
sweetie , i said you didn &apos;t need to come .
they said it &apos;ll be at least another hour .
frankie &apos;s gotten worse .
she &apos;s light @-@ headed and really short of breath .
they did an x @-@ ray .
no , jon , it &apos;s just the flu . look around . everybody has it .
you should have stayed home . now link is gonna get it .
honey , she was coughing up pink stuff .
your husband made the right call .
it is more than just flu .
i &apos;m afraid fancesca has cardiomyopathy .
what ?
wait , that -- that &apos;s -- that &apos;s what ivy has .
dr. hunt , she went into complete heart block and lost her pulse .
remove the oxygen mask and ambu her .
push for enough atropine
and get a transcutaneous pacer on her now .
right away , doctor .
ivy &apos;s transplant went very well .
she &apos;s doing great .
we &apos;ll monitor her ,
and you can see her as soon as she wakes up .
and francesca &apos;s heart &apos;s been stabilized for now ,
but we are gonna need to implant a pacemaker as soon as possible .
and she has cardiomyopathy ?
that &apos;s what the tests show , just like her sister .
how did both of them get this ?
it could be a number of things --
uh , viral , genetic , environmental .
like , there &apos;s something in our house making them sick ?
mold or -- - we can &apos;t go home .
ivy just got a new heart and link --
i suggest we start with a family medical history
and we &apos;ll see if there &apos;s any pattern
of heart disease in the family ,
particularly in younger relatives .
how soon can we start ?
what are the odds ,
dealing with two cardiomyopathies on the same day ?
i know , and you had your trial patients to think about .
but ross can handle that .
no , i &apos;m saying , &quot; what are the odds ? &quot;
presenting at the same age in two sisters .
it &apos;s weird , isn &apos;t it ?
really weird .
tell you what , you do the girl &apos;s pacemaker stat .
i &apos;ll look in to the family history ,
and we &apos;ll figure it out .
okay .
98.6 .
i have a cough . feel my glands .
i &apos;m not touching your glands .
i &apos;ve got to take care of my conduit kids .
yes ! first of all , swap monkey !
i have not fallen ,
but those are helpless children in there ,
and if i expose them to this bug ,
it could set back the research .
drink some tea and be a man .
i &apos;ll take weekend calls for you for a month .
you know , i &apos;d have done it anyway
&apos;cause those are just helpless little children .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
my student loans are deferred to after my fellowship .
which ends really soon !
alex , based on your current salary ,
it &apos;s gonna take you 20 years to pay off the full amount !
and that &apos;s with a fixed interest rate
and paying twice the monthly minimum .
you wait any longer , it &apos;ll amortize ! you &apos;re --
all right , back off , scrooge mcduck ! i &apos;ll be fine .
your face is scrooge mcduck !
you ... needs to be worked .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry about that .
can i just -- can i just take a minute ?
i need to cool down .
oh , no .
no , no , no .
that kind of rage is exactly what we &apos;re gonna need .
keep it going .
scrub ! come on . hustle .
hey . okay , so what did you think ?
the surgery was cool , but , uh , i mean ,
lebackes -- you like that guy ?
he &apos;s ridiculously talented and he runs a really fun o.r.
yeah , just ask him .
surgery went very well -- beautifully well .
we &apos;re looking at a full recovery ,
so no need for a colostomy bag .
really ?
yeah .
he &apos;s a big , strong boy . he &apos;s gonna be just fine .
more than just fine .
he &apos;s gonna be perfect .
thank you , dr.lebackes.
thank you so much .
that &apos;s the good part . that &apos;s the money in there .
it never gets old .
well , long day , successful surgery .
you know what time it is now ?
time for more surgeries ?
time to unwind .
karev , do you play golf ?
dear lord in heaven , no ! you &apos;re not --
no , no , no , no , no !
what ?
dr. shepherd , don &apos;t come in here !
but you paged me .
this child has s.c.i.d.
if you &apos;re sick at all , you cannot be in here .
close that door .
oh , my god .
well , see , i &apos;m the only one available .
you got a better idea ?
yeah . yeah , i think i do .
what ?
okay , babcock , please .
here you go , doctor .
and umbilical tape .
this is a huge abscess .
we should hang another unit of blood .
another liter of saline , please .
murphy , he &apos;s already got a unit of l.r. hanging .
keep up .
it &apos;s not for him .
it &apos;s for me .
murphy , are you on an i.v. ?
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;m super dehydrated .
and i can &apos;t keep anything down .
it &apos;s really helping with the dizziness , too .
maybe you should go home .
yeah , murphy , maybe you sh--
no !
no , i have found a way to push through ,
and i &apos;m not gonna break the unspoken rule
everyone keeps speaking about .
it &apos;s like you say , sir -- unless my presence here
is doing my patient more harm than my absence would ,
it &apos;s my duty to stay .
impressive , murphy .
i &apos;m proud of you .
yay me .
you look really cool .
you don &apos;t look ridiculous at all . how do you feel ?
i &apos;m fine .
let &apos;s keep working .
roger , major tom .
commencing countdown .
okay , i &apos;m gonna ... take this slow .
all right .
okay .
really ?
really .
all right , here .
hold that there . that .
now , you got to hit it hard .
this just -- it -- this feels wrong .
no , hey , look , i told you the bone is misaligned ,
all right , so we have to complete the break
before we can put it back together .
oh , my god . don &apos;t be a weenie .
i can &apos;t !
look , you &apos;re stronger than you think .
now just -- - no , i &apos;m stronger than you think .
i &apos;ve put guys in the hospital before .
okay , yeah , i know . the guy from o.b.
and two guys before him .
wow . okay . wow .
look , when i get mad , i get ...
i don &apos;t trust myself .
that &apos;s why i thought i hurt him this morning .
i don &apos;t want to do this . i don &apos;t want to hurt people .
i want to fix them .
well , this is the only way to fix him .
and it &apos;s an easy fix .
look , that &apos;s the nice thing about ortho .
most of them are easy fixes ,
but they take strength and power that not a lot of people have ...
or the fearlessness .
what &apos;s next ?
uh , next .
next ... we drill .
yes .
how you &apos;re doing , dr. shepherd ?
i &apos;m good .
just ... taking it slow .
almost ... imperceptibly slow .
at this rate , you &apos;re not even gonna make your big conference .
okay , kepner , step in here .
denude the sinus of mucosa .
as a trauma surgeon , you need to learn this .
especially since he &apos;s about to ralph in his space suit .
bailey , shut up .
okay , kepner , take the ... periosteal elevator .
yes , sir .
it &apos;s a long drive .
ohh , come on ! ohh !
i &apos;m telling you , you got too much turn in your backswing . here .
watch this .
oliver hits the ball from the tee and ...
it &apos;s a hole in one !
nice .
all of this .
and your clinic is nicer than my house .
yeah . mine , too .
actually , i &apos;m kidding .
my house is way better .
and you don &apos;t have any more patients or , uh , anything today ?
nah . i like to space things out .
keep things civilized .
it &apos;s one of the perks of having your own practice .
ohh ! swings , and in the bunker .
i &apos;m in the bunker . you &apos;re up .
my partners and i are talking about expanding our practice ,
bringing in someone new .
another tough shot for alex .
where are you at with your fellowship ?
what ? my what ?
have you started thinking about what &apos;s next ?
well , i @-@ i @-@ i like where i am .
sure . of course .
robbins is great .
but ... the perks here ...
oliver swings .
... are more than just big tvs and fancy offices .
making more money means being able to donate
more money to do more outreach .
i , uh , started an african exchange program at gsm .
right . like that .
i set my own hours .
so i &apos;m taking a month off next spring
so i can go to mafraq and treat syrian refugees .
give it some thought . i think you &apos;d be a good fit .
it &apos;s a 250k buy @-@ in , which you &apos;ll pay off in two years , tops .
another two , and i guarantee you &apos;ll pay off
all your student loans with cash to spare .
plus , you , too , could have your name emblazoned
on a fine writing utensil just like this .
murphy , can you suction out some of that fecal debris ?
and while you &apos;re at it , this abscess
is going into the retroperitoneal cavity .
can you suction some of that puss around that necrotic tissue .
feels good , doesn &apos;t it , murphy ?
you know , i remember working a 24 @-@ hour shift
through a bout of salmonella in my third year .
suction , please .
pork was the culprit .
bad pork .
it tasted fine , but i remember it being a little ... slick .
but a physician doesn &apos;t succumb to illness .
she conquers it , right ?
right , murphy ? what &apos;s the matter ?
are you not answering because you &apos;ve thrown up in your mouth ?
back away from the field , murphy .
yeah , go home .
good effort , murphy .
lightweight .
what a wuss .
hey , how &apos;s it going ?
we &apos;re advancing the leads now .
so i went through the mcneils &apos; family history .
nothing specifically indicates that it &apos;s genetic .
something is damaging these kids &apos; hearts .
hers is enlarged , and her e.f. is low .
she &apos;s gonna wind up on the transplant list .
well , it &apos;s still early for that .
the mcneils have given you consent
to do a biopsy while you &apos;re still in there .
oh , and murphy apparently just threw up in an o.r. ,
so i need to start rescheduling elective procedures .
oh , it &apos;s got to be viral .
clearly .
she &apos;s the eighth surgeon i &apos;ve had come down with this thing .
no . this ... the mcneils .
it &apos;s got to be viral myocarditis .
i bet you it is . bring on the pacing .
all right , we are almost done .
yes . so don &apos;t pee .
excuse me .
don &apos;t you pee on me .
dr. edwards .
dr. murphy went home sick
in the middle of an intestinal resection .
are you available ?
oh , absolutely .
do you think you can take over these patients ?
no .
oh , hey ! come ... oh , all right .
hey , okay , we had a deal .
i &apos;ll tell them you &apos;re busy .
no , no , no . no , no . i &apos;m not busy .
i &apos;m not ...
we used plates and screws
so that the bone will heal straight .
so his body -- his organically pure ,
grass @-@ fed body is full of titanium ?
can i get a list of the materials that you guys used ?
the -- the rods ?
i don &apos;t know , like , anaesthesia and stuff for -- for him ?
uh , well , i don &apos;t know .
um , that could take a while .
i &apos;d have to contact distributors .
normally , i wouldn &apos;t ask this ,
but our dad died when we were really young ,
and he was done in by corned @-@ beef hash and cigarettes .
and since then , logan &apos;s been obsessed with what he puts in his body .
he &apos;s a pain in the ass .
i wish he wouldn &apos;t take it so far ,
but ... that &apos;s just how he deals .
i &apos;ll do it .
really ?
sure . no biggie .
any chance the titanium was locally mined ?
ohh , you &apos;re feeling it , aren &apos;t you ?
the ortho glow .
thank you .
ohh , is that what this is ?
ohh , you know , i can be fairly turbulent myself .
yeah , i &apos;ve had my share of things to get angry about .
ortho &apos;s saved me a couple of times .
i get to work my crap out and someone else
is healed in the process and i get paid .
it &apos;s a win @-@ win @-@ win .
right now i feel like i might never get angry again .
oh , sweetie . you date alex karev .
you always have a reason to be angry .
hey , where have you been ?
you &apos;ve got five kids to discharge .
this place is disgusting .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be , uh , sick by now ?
oh , crap . i &apos;m losing my touch .
it was my superpower . and now i &apos;ve lost it .
how much money do you make ?
excuse me ?
i mean , as an attending here . what &apos;s your salary ?
i &apos;m not answering that .
why , because you &apos;re ashamed ?
no , because it &apos;s classless !
and you should be ashamed , you hobo .
look , just tell me .
no , get to work , alex .
oh , god .
okay .
you can &apos;t do this .
if i can do surgery , i can stand and talk to people .
i have to .
it &apos;s not worth it .
see , you &apos;ve never really been on board with this whole project .
no , derek , at some point , you have to ask yourself
is your presence here going to do more harm than good ?
trust me .
you &apos;re better off calling this thing off
than to get up on that stage and vomit ... or worse .
meredith , i have no choice . this is what we do .
we push through .
okay ?
oh , no .
oh , no , no .
dr. shepherd , don &apos;t get up .
you &apos;re dehydrated . you have i.v. phenergan .
i don &apos;t want you to pull out your i.v.
i &apos;m ...
here you go , dr. shepherd .
ohh . here you go .
you &apos;re not even warm !
i do feel much better .
i have been changing diapers ,
restarting i.v.s , getting peed on .
i missed out on a surgery &apos; cause you &apos;re up here
sleeping off your imaginary illness .
are the kids okay ? did any of them get sick ?
no . they &apos;re fine .
you won &apos;t be .
thank you , stephanie .
seriously .
you &apos;re welcome .
ross .
how are the conduit patients ?
uh , they &apos;re great .
great numbers , no problems .
perfect day 30 .
good .
well , i &apos;ll see you upstairs .
we &apos;ll get started on the report .
so you &apos;re ju--
all your weekend calls ,
and i &apos;m your swap monkey for two months .
it &apos;s just exciting .
you know , you meet someone and there &apos;s just ...
a connection .
oh , we just clicked .
she &apos;s just -- oh , i don &apos;t know .
she just -- she gets it . she gets me .
and there &apos;s still every chance that it might not work out .
i mean , only something like
4 % of ortho surgeons are women .
but that &apos;s also why it would be so cool .
callie .
yeah ?
oh ! my god . did you fall ?
no , no , no .
the floor is just really nice and cool .
and this is my friend .
but guess what .
what ?
i &apos;ve still got it .
my superpowers are intact .
super .
how long will he have to be like this ?
well , at least until the immediate infection is over .
after that is hard to say .
how is he gonna heal if he &apos;s stressed out ,
if he can &apos;t even be comfortable ?
we &apos;ll have to trust that the multitude
of antibiotics will do their jobs .
if his immunity doesn &apos;t come back up ,
it &apos;s very possible that he &apos;ll need to be
in some sort of isolation for the rest of his life .
the rest of his life ?
baby !
mom ! dad !
we love you , champ !
we &apos;re right here for you , buddy .
don &apos;t be scared .
we &apos;re not going anywhere .
we &apos;re right here .
mom .
we &apos;re right here , braden .
champ , it &apos;s okay .
don &apos;t worry .
we &apos;re never gonna leave you . okay ?
we love you .
it &apos;s a known fact
that doctors make the worst patients .
you okay ?
i brought you some hot soup .
hello ?
get out .
okay , all right . okay .
* i &apos;ve done all right up till now *
* it &apos;s the light of day that shows me how *
* when the night falls *
* loneliness calls *
i &apos;m here if you need anything , okay ?
okay .
* oh , i wanna dance with somebody *
we ignore our symptoms
... until we &apos;re facedown on the ground .
you actually dug my crap out of the trash .
there &apos;s like 85 jokes i could make right now .
go ahead , chuckles . make your jokes .
but sit down and pay your bills .
why do you even care ?
i know that you would rather just shove stuff aside ,
out of sight , out of mind ,
but the longer you wait , the worse you make it .
look at your dad .
you avoided him for years ,
and when you finally had to deal with him ,
it was torture .
but you dealt with him .
and there &apos;s no way you can tell me
that you don &apos;t feel better .
it &apos;s that easy , huh ?
yeah .
it &apos;s an easy fix .
and easy fixes are just so satisfying .
i may have figured out an easier one .
we like to think
we &apos;re a different species than our patients .
i missed it .
you did .
are they all gone ?
gerhardt strauss ?
were they pissed ?
no , actually , it went pretty well .
they all seemed sold .
except for the estonian guy . he was lost .
wait . what happened ?
look . good evening .
dr. shepherd welcomes you all
and regrets that he couldn &apos;t be here with you tonight .
he has taken suddenly , and very disgustingly ...
... ill .
i told you -- i &apos;ve heard it enough times .
so i am the wife .
you did my speech .
and i &apos;m here in his stead .
well ...
when my husband was first approached
about this project , i was not on board .
i kind of did my speech .
oh , my god . - it would take time and energy --
time away from our family ,
our marriage , my work ...
his work .
but as i soon realized , as you will tonight ...
... that this is a vital and momentous opportunity .
it is worth every minute of your precious time .
so let &apos;s get started .
everyone knows someone
who has suffered from a brain disorder .
but none of us are invincible .
oh , this is bad .
i &apos;m going home .
oh , god .
and we &apos;ll have dr. yang come and explain it .
francesca &apos;s pacemaker is functioning well ,
and i reviewed ivy &apos;s post @-@ op echo
and saw no signs of graft failure .
now the bad news ?
unfortunately ,
the biopsy did not show a viral cause .
so what &apos;s causing this ?
we &apos;d like to run more tests .
maybe even have someone
evaluate your home for other exposures .
we have no idea .
we don &apos;t know what &apos;s causing their hearts to fail .
but the good news is we caught it ,
and we &apos;re treating it .
eventually , we have to face
the fact that we &apos;re human ...
i &apos;m not sick . i &apos;m okay .
... and that sometimes ...
even the mightiest of us need help .
