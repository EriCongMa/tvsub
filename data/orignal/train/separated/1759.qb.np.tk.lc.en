i just read about an experiment
designed to see if you could make two people fall
in love in a matter of hours .
that doesn &apos;t sound right .
my research has shown that it takes three to five years
of shameless begging .
honey , neither of us comes off good in that story .
yeah , i @-@ i ...
i saw that article you &apos;re talking about .
uh , the participants ask each other a series of questions
designed to promote intimacy .
and then they finish it off by staring
into each other &apos;s eyes for four minutes .
oh , that &apos;s nonsense .
i proclaimed my love for you .
and the last time i looked into your eyes
was when you thought you had conjunctivitis .
other than the fact that i had it ,
that was a magical night .
raj , would you ever try an experiment like that with emily ?
what ? i don &apos;t need science to win her heart .
i have my family &apos;s wealth for that .
i &apos;m telling you , you can &apos;t create love in a few hours .
right ?
oh , careful .
you &apos;re poking at the whole foundation of the bachelor .
yeah , but we don &apos;t have to debate this .
we &apos;re scientists .
we can conduct our own research .
yeah , i propose that we imprison two street people .
no .
and ...
you didn &apos;t even let me finish .
forget it !
so , you can experiment on all the apes you want .
but i want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings ,
suddenly i &apos;m the monster .
why don &apos;t you just do the test ?
in the interest of science , i &apos;d be willing to .
what ? you &apos;re okay with an experiment where you have
to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings ?
yes .
please , can i do it with him ? please ? !
i &apos;ve been listening to sheldon &apos;s feelings on things for ten years .
tag , you &apos;re it .
yeah , but what if the experiment works ?
i &apos;m not gonna fall in love with sheldon .
that &apos;s what i said .
before i knew it , he pontificated his way
right into my heart .
uh , fun fact-- &quot; pontificate &quot;
comes from the latin word &quot; pontifex , &quot;
which means &quot; bridge builder &quot; or &quot; pope . &quot;
in love yet ?
just out of curiosity , penny ,
if this experiment does make us fall in love ,
would you drive me to lake geneva , wisconsin
for gary con ?
it &apos;s the only convention celebrating
the life and work of gary gygax ,
the co @-@ creator of dungeons and dragons .
you know what ? i can honestly say
if we fall in love , not only will i drive you there ,
i will buy you all the dragon t @-@ shirts you want .
okay , babe , let &apos;s do this .
you guys are really being calm
about penny and sheldon doing this thing .
if it were me ,
i @-@ i &apos;d be a little nervous .
why ?
well , even if the study &apos;s nonsense ,
i @-@ i don &apos;t believe in tempting fate .
same reason i wouldn &apos;t use a ouija board ,
or pick a fight with an asian guy .
he probably doesn &apos;t know karate , but ...
why risk it ?
i think we &apos;re safe .
well , that &apos;s what the bullies at bruce lee &apos;s high school thought .
and then , bam !
karate .
well , are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment ?
the two of us could do it .
yeah , sure , that might be fun .
what &apos;s the first question ?
hang on .
okay .
&quot; given the choice of anyone in the world ,
whom would you want as a dinner guest ? &quot;
i can honestly say penny .
then i choose a janitor .
&apos;cause i &apos;m about to throw up .
i &apos;m in love .
let &apos;s do something else .
ooh , uh , emily gets off work soon .
why don &apos;t the four of us go out ?
okay .
sounds good .
should we call howard and bernadette ?
i don &apos;t know what time their plane gets in ,
but let me , let me shoot them a text .
did he say anything about the funeral ?
not much , but he seemed to be in a pretty good place .
are you kidding me ? !
you lost my mother &apos;s ashes ? !
no , i @-@ i &apos;m just saying that sometimes bags are misrouted .
all right , fine . where did you misroute
the only woman who ever loved me ?
the first ... well , first , i meant first .
i just need some information .
uh , what &apos;s the flight number ?
816 .
i really did mean first .
just drop it .
and can you describe the bag ?
um , well , it &apos;s , uh , black .
there &apos;s a red ribbon tied to the handle ...
the world &apos;s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment !
you ready to begin ?
yup . be right there .
i assume you don &apos;t want wine .
correct .
you &apos;re not supposed to drink alcohol
when operating heavy machinery .
what heavy machinery ?
let &apos;s just start .
well , as a texas gentleman ,
i &apos;m inclined to say ladies first .
although , i &apos;m concerned that level of politeness and charm
might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins .
perhaps we should flip a coin .
or if you &apos;re familiar with the rules
of rock , paper , scissors ...
question one .
&quot; given the choice of anyone in the world ,
whom would you want as a dinner guest ? &quot;
living or dead ?
just says &quot; anyone in the world . &quot;
i guess that means living .
ah , that &apos;s just as well .
as much as i &apos;d love to meet euclid--
inventor of the geometric proof--
he probably wore sandals
and i cannot look at toes during dinner .
oh , i know !
the person i &apos;d most like to have dinner with
is myself .
you sure that &apos;s your choice ?
&apos;cause i &apos;ve had that dinner .
well , i haven &apos;t .
and while they say never meet your heroes ,
i just don &apos;t see how i could disappoint .
who would you choose ?
robert downey , jr .
you ...
i didn &apos;t think of iron man .
you know , maybe after myself and i have dinner ,
we can meet you two for dessert .
so , what do you guys want to do ?
well , we &apos;re the ones tagging along , you pick .
have you ever been to an escape room ?
mm @-@ mm , what &apos;s that ?
um ... it &apos;s kind of like interactive theater ,
except you have to solve puzzles
in a certain amount of time to get out .
there &apos;s one downtown where
they trap you in a room with a zombie .
so , kind of like what &apos;s happening with penny right now .
&quot; what would constitute
a perfect day for you ? &quot;
uh , well ...
i &apos;d probably sleep in , do a little yoga ,
then lie on the beach while
cute cabana boys brought me drinks and ...
probably get a massage
and then cap off the night with some dancing .
that &apos;s it ?
yeah , why ?
you didn &apos;t mention leonard .
he &apos;s there .
i don &apos;t think so .
leonard can &apos;t stand yoga ,
the beach , massages or dancing .
yeah , well , he brought a book , okay ?
what &apos;s yours ?
uh , i wake up .
uh , i enjoy some french toast with butter and syrup .
uh , then a wormhole opens ,
and whisks me millions of years into the future
where my towering intellect is used to save
the last remnants of mankind
from a predatory alien race .
interesting , you didn &apos;t mention amy .
who do you think made the french toast with butter and syrup ?
you &apos;re about to enter the lab
of the late dr. david saltzberg .
while conducting studies on slowing the aging process ,
there was a catastrophic accident and he died .
or did he ?
ladies ?
are you being polite or scared ?
yup .
ah , what a room !
this is cool .
so , how do we start ?
we have to look for the clues hidden around the room .
uh , wasn &apos;t there supposed to be a zombie ?
okay , let &apos;s hope one of the clues
is written on a pair of clean underwear .
mr. and mrs. wolowitz ?
as far as i can tell , your bag arrived in los angeles .
so , where is it ?
i don &apos;t know , perhaps somebody
took it off the carousel by mistake ?
so , some stranger has my mom ?
is that what you &apos;re telling me ?
my poor mother can be anywhere in los angeles right now ?
i @-@ i wish i was telling you that .
um ... but the passenger could &apos;ve gotten
on an international flight .
oh , okay , great !
so , your entire job is to find lost luggage ,
and you &apos;ve narrowed down the location
of my mother to the planet earth !
i &apos;m sorry !
w @-@ would 500 frequent @-@ flyer miles help ?
that could get you to sacramento .
&quot; if you could wake up tomorrow
having gained any one quality or ability ,
what would it be ? &quot;
well , not to steal from the bible ,
but turning water into wine sounds pretty good .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re taking this seriously .
come on , i &apos;m just having some fun with you .
i believe what you &apos;re doing
is using humor to avoid vulnerability .
fine .
honestly ...
if i could have one quality ...
i wish i could be as smart as you guys .
ha ! keep dreaming .
sheldon !
i &apos;m sorry .
that was me having fun with you .
look .
you may not be as ...
academically inclined as are we .
yes , that &apos;s how you say it .
but ...
you possess an intelligence i envy .
which leads me to my answer .
i would choose the ability
to read people &apos;s minds .
well , i can &apos;t read people &apos;s minds .
actually , that &apos;s not true .
i can read men &apos;s minds .
but only &apos; cause it &apos;s usually the one thing .
when are we going to get robot eyes ?
you &apos;re all alike .
well , what i meant was ...
i often misinterpret
how others are feeling .
like , i can &apos;t always tell if someone is only joking
or laughing at me .
you know , like , uh , if they &apos;re mad at something i &apos;ve done
or just in a bad mood .
it @-@ it &apos;s incredibly stressful .
really ? you always seem so confident .
well , i &apos;m not .
and if i could read people &apos;s minds ,
life would be so much simpler .
well , now i wish i had the ability
to make that stuff easier for you .
thank you .
wow , i just felt
this wave of affection for you .
you sure it &apos;s not too much bible juice ?
and the wave is gone .
brains !
keep it down ! we &apos;re working here .
okay , we &apos;ve got the cipher decoded !
how &apos;s it going with the globe ?
we used the coordinates to locate the cities .
i &apos;m putting the city names in the grid now .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;ll give us the code to the safe .
solve puzzle too fast !
slow down !
yup ! got the code .
just saying ...
no refund for finish early !
sure you don &apos;t want to go home ?
when the bag &apos;s returned , they &apos;ll deliver it to us .
no , i &apos;m not leaving without her .
all right , we &apos;ll wait .
i could &apos;ve driven her .
what ?
the day she left for florida .
she asked me to drive her to the airport .
i @-@ i was too busy .
and ... i made her
take a cab .
i was too busy .
there &apos;s no way you could &apos;ve known .
be right back .
excuse me ?
yes ?
you better find my husband &apos;s mother
&apos;cause one way or another , we &apos;re walking out of this airport
with a dead woman !
which book are we looking for ?
origin of species .
here it is .
there &apos;s a black light .
oh , hang on .
oh , okay .
uh , &quot; brothers and sisters i have none ,
but this man &apos;s father is my father &apos;s son .
who am i looking at ? &quot;
yeah , yeah , we get it-- you want brains .
calm down .
well , if i don &apos;t have a brother ,
my father &apos;s son is me .
and if i &apos;m this man &apos;s father , then he &apos;s my son .
the answer &apos;s &quot; son . &quot;
ooh ! there &apos;s a picture of the sun over there .
i bet the key &apos;s behind it .
could be somewhere else !
oh , got the key !
so , that &apos;s the key to the door ?
that &apos;s it ?
we spent $ 200 on six minutes of fun ?
it &apos;s like when you bought that remote @-@ controlled helicopter ,
and it just ... flew away .
sorry , guys .
really thought the puzzles would be better .
well , to be fair , we do all have advanced degrees .
remember that before you post on yelp !
&quot; if you were to die this evening with no opportunity
to communicate with anyone ,
what would you most regret not having told someone ? &quot;
so , it would be today ?
well , i suppose there &apos;s something satisfying
about dying on my birthday .
today &apos;s your birthday ?
yes .
well , that &apos;s always been a secret !
not even amy knows !
well , i don &apos;t enjoy presents .
and the thought of people
jumping out and yelling &quot; surprise ! &quot;
fills me with more dread than the words
&quot; george lucas director &apos;s cut . &quot;
so , why did you finally tell me ?
the point of the experiment is
to be completely honest with each other .
well , thank you for sharing it with me .
i won &apos;t tell anyone .
thank you .
that is so funny .
i never would have pegged you for a pisces .
you &apos;re making it difficult to love you right now .
great news ! your bag was returned .
oh , thank god !
it &apos;s okay , she &apos;s here !
ma &apos;s here .
okay , thank you so much .
ma ?
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t take you to the airport .
i just want you to know
that i &apos;ll never forgive myself for being so selfish .
and i promise
to keep you close
for the rest of my life .
oh , no . that thing &apos;s gonna end up in my bedroom .
that &apos;s it ! we &apos;re done with the questions .
all that &apos;s left to do is stare into each other &apos;s eyes
for four minutes without talking .
okay .
wait , hang on !
bladder check .
we &apos;re good to go .
you ready ?
yes .
and begin .
this is kind of creepy .
we &apos;re not supposed to talk during this part .
sorry .
this is kind of creepy .
do you want to stop ?
i know you have trouble with eye contact .
well , you have a brown fleck in your right iris
that looks like a formula one race car .
so ... i &apos;m just concentrating on that .
plus , it &apos;s easier around people
that i &apos;m comfortable with .
aw , sweetie , i &apos;m comfortable around you , too .
of course you are , i &apos;m warm and soothing .
i &apos;m like a human bowl of tomato soup .
i meant more like a little brother .
well , i suppose i do think of you as a sister .
and sometimes , a mother .
it &apos;s getting creepy again .
what ?
just thinking about the day i met you and leonard .
it was a monday afternoon .
you joined us for indian food .
can you believe it &apos;s been eight years ?
yeah , and you &apos;re still eating our food .
i ... can &apos;t remember a time
you guys weren &apos;t in my life .
i remember it perfectly .
but i have an eidetic memory .
if you &apos;re interested , i also remember
how much you owe us for the food .
that &apos;s it .
that wasn &apos;t so bad .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
uh , now let &apos;s tabulate the results of the experiment .
i think it &apos;s safe to say that you &apos;re not in love with me
and i &apos;m not in love with you .
and psychology has once again
proved itself the doofus of the sciences .
well , maybe .
but i &apos;m still glad we did it .
i do feel closer to you .
and i , you .
and yes , that &apos;s how you say that .
yeah , so , given our newfound intimacy ,
i &apos;d say we have some hard choices to make .
like what ?
gary con-- do we fly or drive ?
do we wear costumes ?
and if so ...
who gets to be gary ?
thank you for walking me home .
i just want to make sure you get there safe .
well , this is me .
it &apos;s been a very interesting evening .
it really has .
surprise !
and after i let you be gary !
