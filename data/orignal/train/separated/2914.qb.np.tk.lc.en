why am i talking like this ?
i didn &apos;t think you could keep it a secret .

i am an excellent secret @-@ keeper . i have kept all our secrets .
what secrets ?

the.one.where.rachel.tells
it &apos;s so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon .
you know , monica and chandler are married . ross and rachel are having a baby .
maybe you and i should do something .
all in good time , my love . all in good time .
shoot ! i left my guitar in their apartment . well , you can let me in later , right ?
no , i don &apos;t have a key . they took mine to give to you .
what ? they took mine to give to you .
why would they take away our keys ?
maybe they don &apos;t trust us .
they let me keep my key the last time they were out of town .
the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it with monica &apos;s guest towels ?
hey , i washed those .
no , you didn &apos;t .
yeah , that didn &apos;t sound like me .
what will i do ? i really need my guitar .
i have stuff in there too .
what stuff ?
monica &apos;s chicken parm . i &apos;ll take care of it .
hey , mr. treeger ? it &apos;s joey tribbiani .
listen , i need to get into monica and chandler &apos;s apartment . it &apos;s an emergency !
gas leak . oh , and bring garlic bread .
hey , did monica and chandler take off yet ?
yeah .
damn . they left without my pass to the nassau fossil and natural history museum .
there goes the honeymoon .
did rachel find you ?
no , why ?
she was looking for you .
well , i guess i &apos;ll catch up with her later .
she really wanted to talk to you now .
yeah , it seemed pretty important .
oh , no .
what ?
i think i might know what this is about .
really ?
yeah . we promised we weren &apos;t gonna tell anybody this , but ..
about a month ago , rachel and i slept together .
and ?
wow , i thought you &apos;d be a little more shocked .
oh , sorry . and ? !
well , we said we &apos;d just do it that one time ..
but now i think she may wanna start things up again .
yeah , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what it is .
why ? what else could it be ?
oh , wow , i don &apos;t feel well .
i &apos;m telling you , that &apos;s what it is .
no wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding .
she didn &apos;t say anything to you ?
maybe it &apos;s something you ate .
could be , yeah .
please , just go and talk to rachel .
yeah , i guess i should .
man , you know what i have to realize ?
maybe i &apos;m not the type of guy women can have just one night with .
you know , they always seem to want a little bit more .
i should remember that .
next .
they &apos;re kissing . let &apos;s just go around them .
leave them alone . they &apos;re in love .
i &apos;m in love too . but in an orderly fashion .
next .
hi . can you do that and walk ? because she said , &quot; next . &quot;
sorry , we didn &apos;t hear you . we &apos;re on our honeymoon .
let me see what i can do . there are some first @-@ class seats available .
they bumped them up to first class because they &apos;re on their honeymoon !
let &apos;s act like we &apos;re on our honeymoon .
we are on our honeymoon .
grab my ass .
next .
hi . sorry , i almost didn &apos;t hear you .
you know , i &apos;m just so in love with my new husband . we &apos;re on our honeymoon .
congratulations .
thanks .
okay , mr. bing , you &apos;ll be in 25j , and mrs. bing , you &apos;re in 25k .
we &apos;re on our honeymoon , so can you do your little thing and bump us to first class ?
i &apos;m sorry , all the first @-@ class seats are taken . that couple got the last two .
see ? if we &apos;d gone around them like i said , she &apos;d have given us those tickets ! damn it !
25j and k , any chance those aren &apos;t together ?
i still can &apos;t believe they took away my key . i mean , you trust me with yours .
of course i do ! and i &apos;m gonna get it back to you ..
just as soon as they &apos;re done with it at the key @-@ shining place .
what the hell is that ?
i don &apos;t know .
treeger , what are you doing ?
you said there was a gas leak .
why not use your key ?
by the time i found it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded .
if that happens at another building i manage , people will ask questions .
come on , hurry up !
well , we could have done that .
look at that ! they &apos;re going into the first @-@ class lounge .
do you know what they have in there ?
no .
me neither . we have to get in !
just act like you belong .
oh , my god ! oranges !
nice to see you again .
sir , may i see your tickets , please ?
yes , of course .
would you move your thumb ? i can &apos;t see the seat number .
that &apos;s all right . i have it memorized . it &apos;s 1a .
sir , this isn &apos;t a first @-@ class ticket . i &apos;m sorry .
apology accepted . excuse us .
sir , i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m gonna have to ask you to leave .
fine .
go , go !
hi .
hi .
hi .
i think there &apos;s something that we really need to talk about .
i think we do . why don &apos;t we go inside .
look , i know why you &apos;re here .
you do ?
yeah , and to save you from any embarrassment ..
i think maybe i should talk first .
okay .
okay ?
ross and rachel .
rachel and ross .
that &apos;s been one heck of a seesaw , hasn &apos;t it ?
what ?
i mean , look , that one night we had was fun and certainly passionate .
but don &apos;t you think it &apos;s better if we just stay friends ?
seriously , what ?
okay . you know what ?
if you want to , we can do it one more time .
i mean , i &apos;d be okay with that . in fact , i have some time right now ..
okay .
you know what ? can i talk now ?
oh , sure .
okay .
i &apos;m pregnant .
ross ?
ross ?
okay , whenever you &apos;re ready .
and you &apos;re the father , by the way . but you got ..
can i get you some water ?
i &apos;m good .
ross , there is no pressure on you , okay ? i mean , you can be as involved as you want .
yeah , i ..
i &apos;m just , i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t understand ..
how this happened .
we used a condom .
i know .
but you know , condoms only work , like , 97 percent of the time .
what ?
what ? !
well , they should put that on the box !
they do .
no , they don &apos;t !
well , they should put it in huge block letters !
ross , let &apos;s just forget about the condoms .
well , i may as well have !
listen , you know what ? i was really freaked out too ..
when i found out .
freaked .. ? hey , i &apos;m not freaked out .
i &apos;m indignant as a consumer !
you know what ? let &apos;s talk later .
no , i wanna talk now .
in fact , i wanna talk ..
to the president of the condom company .
okay , you know what ? maybe i should come back .. okay .
yeah , i &apos;ll press one !
i looked everywhere . there &apos;s no gas leak .
so then i can heat this up ?
anyway , i &apos;ll get moving on that new door .
great . listen , could you do us a favor and not tell chandler and monica about this ?
because , you know , they don &apos;t have any kids of their own ..
and this door was like a child to them .
well , i &apos;m gonna have to put on a new lock . they &apos;ll find out anyway .
it &apos;s looking like an all @-@ day job . i &apos;m gonna have to cancel my yoga class .
hey , ross . could you tell jasmine i can &apos;t make it to yoga class today ?
sure .
namaste .
oh , my god ! what happened to the door ?
so it &apos;s noticeable , huh ?
look , is rachel here ? i need to talk to her .
didn &apos;t you two already talk ?
yeah , but ..
okay . look , you guys know that rachel and i slept together ..
but there &apos;s something else .
rachel &apos;s pregnant .
holy mother of god !
oh , my god , i can &apos;t believe that !
with my child .
that is brand @-@ new information !
you already know , don &apos;t you ?
little bit .
how you doing ?
okay . i mean , i &apos;ll be okay .
it &apos;s just , i don &apos;t think i handled it very well .
what &apos;d you say to her ?
nothing .
but the complaint department at the condom company got an earful .
then when i turned around , she was gone .
oh , ross .
i know . but in my defense , i just found out that condoms are only , like , 97 % effective .
what ?
i gotta go find her .
hey . hold on ! are you serious ?
so , like , 3 percent of the time , they don &apos;t even work ?
they should put that on the box !
evidently , they do .
what ? !
well , i &apos;ll be .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re here .
you &apos;ve gotta be kidding .
what ?
as a wedding gift to you , the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite .
no ! you have been screwing us all day !
who are you ?
we &apos;re you . just 10 seconds later !
you already got the first @-@ class tickets , the lounge . we should get free stuff too !
you &apos;re not the only ones on your honeymoon !
you can have the suite if you want . we don &apos;t care about where we stay .
we &apos;re here to celebrate our love for each other .
we don &apos;t have to get free stuff . we just want to be together .
we need the stuff .
monica , it &apos;s joey . phoebe and i smell gas coming from your apartment .
what ? are you serious ? joey smells gas .
what else is new ?
we &apos;d check it out , but you took our keys .
well , do something . get in there !
how ? i guess i could break down your door .
yeah , do that .
and you won &apos;t blame us for any damage ?
no .
are you doing it ? i don &apos;t hear anything .
okay , i &apos;ll break it down .
hi . he &apos;s doing it , he &apos;s breaking down the door .
okay , we &apos;re in .
okay , rachel , are you comfortable ?
if i said i was , would you judge me ?
the doctor &apos;ll be here in a minute to do your sonogram .
okay .
oh , man , i swear , if they sold these at pottery barn ..
hi .
hi .
we need to talk .
right now ? because i kind of got an alfresco situation going on over here .
please , i really .. i want to apologize for the way i acted earlier today .
that &apos;s fine . can you stay up near my head ?
what ? oh , yeah , sorry .
i went crazy . i was thinking about myself when i should &apos;ve been thinking about you ..
okay , head , ross ! head , ross !
right .
i want you to know that i &apos;m gonna be there through this whole thing . okay ?
the doctor &apos;s appointments , the lamaze classes , baby @-@ proofing the apartment .
although , we can worry about that after we get married .
married ?
well , yeah , i think we should get married .
because that &apos;s your answer to everything ?
no . because that &apos;s the right thing to do .
yeah , maybe , if you &apos;re in love . but ross , we are not in love , are we ?
no . but still , i mean , you can &apos;t possibly do this alone .
excuse me ?
you can &apos;t even eat alone in a restaurant .
what ?
if you can &apos;t eat by yourself , how do you expect to have a baby by yourself ?
i can too eat by myself !
when have you ever ?
when certain people leave the table and i am not finished !
well , certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup !
oh , please . you inhale your food .
i grew up with monica . if you didn &apos;t eat fast , you didn &apos;t eat !
am i interrupting ?
no , dr. long . please come in . this is ross . he is the father .
but not the husband , because , evidently , she can do this alone .
nice to meet you . i &apos;ll get started on this .
why you can &apos;t admit you need me ?
i need you to stay near my head !
okay . everything looks good . here it is on the screen .
here &apos;s your uterus ..
and right here is your baby .
oh , my god .
there it is . i see it .
congratulations . i &apos;ll give you two a minute .
okay .
thank you .
pretty amazing , huh ?
i don &apos;t see it !
what ?
i can &apos;t see it .
but you just said that you did .
i know . i lied . i didn &apos;t want her to think i was a terrible mother .
i can &apos;t even see my own baby !
oh , sure . come here . sure , you can . come here . look , it &apos;s right there .
oh , it &apos;s beautiful .
i see it now .
do you really ?
no , i don &apos;t see it !
okay . come on . all right . okay .
you see this tiny thing that looks like a peanut ?
yeah .
sweetie , that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s it ?
well , i saw that .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
wow , i can &apos;t believe that &apos;s our baby .
yeah , that &apos;s our baby .
well , they put up the new door .
so it &apos;s all locked up and secure ?
yeah . why ?
i was trying to figure out how bad i want one of monica &apos;s turkey pot pies .
hi .
hey .
so how was the doctor ?
everything went great .
good .
hey , show them the picture of your uterus .
i don &apos;t see the baby . where is it ?
oh , no , i know . i couldn &apos;t see it either at first . but it &apos;s right ..
