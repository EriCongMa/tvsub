第三集
The most powerful sorcerer in all the realms
is stuck inside a tree?
And you think we can get him out?
Merlin's prophecies are never wrong.
This rose is now linked to your beast.
As long as it still has petals, he lives.
Just because I'm the Dark One
doesn't mean we can't still be together.
They're here to destroy the Dark One.
But helping them may be the only way
I'll ever get my hands on that dagger.
Merlin's tower.
There must be something in here
to get him out of that tree.
You can make that weapon whole again
and use it to snuff out the light.
Our yield's way down, boys.
I know Dopey's a tree,
but we got to be more productive since he can't.
He's producing oxygen.
Let's stay focused.
Yes.
No one wants a nasty surprise.
You're not getting any dust, sister.
Actually, I'm shopping for something else today.
Something with...edge.
My axe.
Oh, Happy, there's something I learned as the Dark One.
If your name is on something, hold on to it.
If we're going to free Merlin, we need witchbane.
Yeah, but the labels are all faded.
Forget the decloaking potion. It's not a glamour anyway.
You sure?
If I'm getting this right,
the tree could actually be Him transfigured, right?
We could find out with a sample.
Yeah, and when we snap off a twig and it turns into a finger,
who's crying then?
Come on, someone. Witchbane.
You guys sure you don't want me to just wiggle my nose
and get him out of that tree?
No.
Your magic is dark now. It's not worth it.
I'll just keep pretending to be the savior
destined to free him, and we can do this together.
Regina's right, Emma.
I heard someone say a woman is right.
That's always a safe assumption, isn't it, David?
How are you progressing, madame savior?
Progress.
Slow but sure.
It's, uh...Marvelous having Merlin's own books to work with.
It's like talking with the master.
What if we could talk to him?
What?
Yes.
You are... very occasionally... a genius.
Yes, if we talked to him,
he can tell us how to get him out.
A mushroom.
Toadstool, actually.
Deadly poison.
Extremely useful in communicating across barriers,
even through spells.
Says here it's called the crimson crown.
Yes, I know this name.
It's rumored to grow in Brocéliande,
the forest of eternal night.
Its existence is the stuff of legend, though.
Almost certainly fiction.
People say the same thing about us. How far?
A half day's ride.
But if it is there, it'll be protected by magical forces.
You know what, David? Wait until we know more.
It's not like I'm needed here.
It's a chance.
I'm taking it.
Hold!
Your majesty. Don't try to talk me out of this.
I wouldn't dream of it.
I just wanted to propose, prince David,
if it's quite all right with you,
that I come along and lend aid.
Come with me and we can get ourselves outfitted,
and then we can quest together as brothers.
This question mark... that's my handwriting.
I must've marked this page in Camelot.
I don't know if this is the right answer,
but these books came from there.
I think we were looking at this for answers.
We've been violated!
What's the problem?
What do you think it is? Your kid.
She took my axe.
Dwarfs are your department.
I'll stay on this.
What do you want us to do about it, Leroy?
Help us. We know she's your daughter,
but you got to do something, 'cause if you won't, we will.
Do not hurt her.
It's okay. They can't.
Like that's all that matters? Stop being a scared parent.
Be our sheriff again. We need you.
I'll see about getting the axe back.
Thanks for letting us know.
Looks like just another insult for us to swallow down.
For now.
Why does she need an axe? That's alarming, right?
I don't know. I mean, what could she do with an axe
that she couldn't just do with her powers?
David!
Just wish she'd talk to us.
I know. Me, too.
Worst part is... we can't save her.
Yet. We're trying.
How? What am I doing?
You're leading.
Nobody seems to be following.
Oh, don't worry about the dwarfs.
I'm not. I'm worried about Emma and how this is my fault.
She made the choice to save everyone.
I should've stopped her. I am her father, and now I'm...
...I'm paralyzed.
There's nothing I can do, for her, for you, for anyone.
You are doing something.
You are helping our people the best you can.
That's kind of the problem.
In any world, you are my hero.
Remember?
Of course.
Go.
I've got it.
Good morning to you, sheriff.
Your majesty. How can I help you?
Any luck finding your blade?
No luck finding Excalibur, I'm afraid,
But I'm coming to you with something far more urgent.
Our reliquary's been robbed.
I'm sorry, your what?
Magical relics collected by the knights of the round table.
They're all very precious.
I had no idea it was here
until it turned up in this land nearly empty.
When you say precious...
There was a magic bean inside.
This bean can take my people home in an instant.
I have to tell you I will find it
if I have to search every residence in your city.
You don't have to do anything alone.
You can help?
I'll get you back to Camelot. I promise.
Thank you.
A dwarf axe.
Now, that's a creative path to failure.
Dwarf axes cut through everything.
Nothing cuts through magic.
Except maybe a kiss.
Have you thought about kissing it out?
You're running out of options, deary.
You see, we want you to, uh, snuff out the light.
So, we need a hero to pull Excalibur from the stone.
Now... and let's face facts... that's not gonna be you.
So, why don't you stop messing around
and go get the hero we need?
And, uh, you and I both know who that is.
It's all right. You'll get it.
Perhaps it's time for a spot of tea.
Calm nerves lead to clear thoughts.
You're here so I can keep an eye on you, mute hand maiden.
I don't need you rolling your eyes at me.
We need to clear the air.
Fine.
There you are, my lovely voice.
It's so... Light and feminine.
Enough.
Now... Let's have a little chat
about you trying to escape back to Oz.
Zelena...
...You know you can't take that child away from Robin.
Can you blame me?
You're going to take it from me.
This child could be my only chance
for someone to truly love me, and...
You got a second chance. Why can't I?
Oh, I'm sorry.
But you've had a second chance
and a second second chance.
You can't keep painting yourself as a victim.
It's absurd.
You can tell me that life is fair all you want.
All I can tell you is that from in here,
I'm still seeing one sister with all the toys...
Be quiet and listen for once in your life.
You forgot who I am.
The Evil Queen.
I can be a far greater nightmare than you can possibly imagine.
But now...
My gift to you is a promise.
I will make sure your baby is fine
and loved and safe.
Just as I promise...
the same will certainly not hold for you.
I like to be prepared.
Is that... Percival's chair?
Yes.
But no need for more apologies.
A leader does what needs to be done.
I'll find a man worthy to fill that seat.
This is the one that will stand empty forever.
I assume that was your cir. Suitable for a king.
No. Mine is no different than the others
In the same way that the table is round.
Many of our order are kings and princes in their own realms.
Nonetheless, happy to sit shoulder to shoulder
with the rest of their knights.
No one of us above the other.
Except for this one.
This is the siege perilous.
Reserved for the knight with the purest heart,
the one destined to carry out the most sacred quests.
Belonged to a man I trusted more than a brother.
But he betrayed me.
It's been vacant since.
Lancelot.
You've heard of him.
Well, all of you are kind of legends.
Really? I shudder to think what our tale must be.
Only one of the greatest romances of all time.
Your love for Guinevere
was ripped away by your best friend, Lancelot.
It's a tragic story that clearly had a happy ending.
The two of you seem like all that's in the past now.
Yes. Lancelot was a good man.
The situation was difficult.
I understand.
Actually, Snow -- Mary Margaret and I, we met him.
You did? How is he?
I'm... very sorry to tell you this,
but we... learned that he died.
I'm sorry.
Lancelot failed to resist temptation,
but he was a good knight.
He tortured himself for his sins far more than I would've done.
I wished him happy.
Just not with my wife.
Careful.
This...is our reliquary,
containing our sacred magical items
our knights have recovered.
I've never seen magic like that.
It's the unquenchable flame.
Said to be part of the burning bush itself.
This will light our path, and where we're going,
we're gonna need it.
The reliquary, Your Majesty.
So, you're the one who found this broken into?
Any theories?
Me?
Well, um...everyone speaks of the Dark One in this place.
Perhaps -- - stop being a fool, man.
Arthur, to be honest, she did take a dwarf axe.
And, as you're about to say, the Dark One doesn't need tools.
This lock was pried open. You can see the scratches.
You're right.
This is your land. What are you thinking?
I'm thinking I may not know who did this.
But I think I have a good idea of what their next move will be.
I know that look. Button on the top turns it on.
I know how to use a phone.
What's that, then?
It's a picture from up inside Zelena.
Whoa, mate.
No, n-no. It's of the baby.
They -- they call it a sonogram.
Mixed emotions, I bet.
I mean, I know it's painful for Regina.
Her evil sister carrying my child.
It's painful for me.
And yet there's some part of me
that can't help but feel happy.
It's my child.
And I sure don't want Regina to know that.
I don't want her to misconstrue my happiness for, well --
You got yourself a complex situation there,
that's for sure.
Unlike your simple love life.
About that.
She's not the same.
Her new house, there's a door in there
that she doesn't want me anywhere near.
What do you suppose she's hiding?
I was thinking that may--
Order up.
Order? I didn't order anything.
What does it say?
"Meet me on your ship. Emma."
You're right.
Things are complicated all over.
That's not funny appearing like that.
Sorry.
What's going on?
I know this has all been really confusing
and I have not made it any easier.
I wanted to apologize for overreacting last time.
I know you're just trying to help.
So, I thought...
we could just talk and have lunch, like old times.
I'd like nothing more.
But this is hardly like old times.
Better?
Come on.
You know you can trust me.
What is it, noon?
You weren't kidding about eternal night. Glad we have the torch.
I'm glad we sent Grif home with the horses.
These woods would make them restless.
Your squire works hard, Your Majesty.
"And you don't thank him enough."
I can hear you saying it even when you don't.
You're right, though.
I don't even have the excuse of ignorance.
I was born a common man and I've been in service myself.
You weren't born noble?
I'm as peasant as they come.
Shepherd.
I can feel my backbone relaxing already.
Let's stop with the "Your Majesties," shall we?
Of course.
As for my squire,
I assure you Guin more than makes up the difference.
Showering him and the others with gifts.
She really is the kindest woman I've ever met.
Sounds like my wife.
When she decides you're family, she'd die for you.
That's not to say Guin doesn't have her fierce side.
With a bow and arrow,
I've seen her take out the eye of a dove in flight.
Mary Margaret could do that.
She wouldn't, but she could.
We should have a tourney. Get them to compete.
Right. 'Cause I'm sure they'd love
to be pitted against each other
to let us feel good about ourselves.
Here.
Then perhaps there are better ways for me to show off.
You're a competitive man for someone with a round table.
I thought the idea was you didn't want to sit above anyone.
Someone who isn't competitive
doesn't need a two-ton table to remind him to be humble.
I know my weaknesses.
Lancelot and Guinevere weren't the only ones to blame
for what happened to them.
I was a difficult man to live with.
But I made a conscious decision to fix things.
I understand that.
This way.
Look upon that, brother.
So it is real.
Crimson crown.
It'll never take both of us.
I'll go.
I'll wait here.
Let the torch be your beacon back.
Thank you.
How's he doing?
Not well.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. But I-I found a healing spell
in one of his old notebooks,
and I've got everything put together
except for one last ingredient.
I, uh, I need an object that touched him
when he was still a man, before he became the Dark One.
You must have something.
Well, nothing I can find.
Still more to look through, though.
You want me to get you some help?
No.
I'm the only one who knows this place, knows his things,
and I need to keep doing something.
Well, then we'll make this quick.
Has anyone come in to pawn anything today?
Especially a magic bean.
A bean?
No. No one's come in. Sorry.
It was worth a shot.
That's all right. You have something else I need.
May I borrow this?
Uh, yeah.
Good. This is gonna point us right at our culprit.
What is it?
It's not magic, though.
It's just a souvenir from doc's birthday party.
It says "Doctoberfest" on it.
I'm very well aware.
Don't worry. I've got this.
Attention, subjects of Camelot!
In my hand, you see the Chalice of Vengeance.
There's been a theft in your encampment.
The Chalice will tell me which among you is the thief.
So, line up for your chance to drink from the sacred cup.
Hold on!
Take over!
Speed is feet, direction is hand.
Circle around!
Thank you.
Think nothing of it.
It would appear you did it. Well done.
I have questions.
You want to know if I'm still the same Emma.
I imagine that's not a simple answer, so let's start easy.
Your new house. What's behind that locked door?
You know I want to trust you, Emma.
Why don't you help me?
So trust me.
With my powers,
I could hide anything from your prying eyes, anyway.
Well, you've answered my first question, too.
You're not the same Emma. She didn't play games.
Yes.
I'm different.
I'm better.
As the Dark One.
I used to be scarred and judgmental and closed off.
Took me forever to see the magic in this place.
And now I...
I see things clearly.
I'm not scared anymore.
Honestly, I'm an open book,
if you're willing to take that trust step.
Are you really suggesting
that we move forward in a real relationship?
Gold and Belle loved each other.
I don't think you should use the crocodile as your example.
But think about it.
He was born a coward.
He didn't find true love until he was the Dark One.
You told me how the man he was
groveled and cried on the deck of this ship.
He changed for the better, too.
You're wrong.
I was the villain in that little drama, Swan.
He was a good man trying to keep his family together.
I took this cutlass and put it to his head and taunted him.
I was the only one there who's changed for the better.
He became an evil, manipulative killer.
Do you remember when we were in the Storybook
and I taught you how to swordplay?
More games. Enough, Swan!
All I wanted was your honesty.
But I'm done... humoring you.
Answer me.
And start by why you brought me here.
It wasn't because this is what we used to do,
because that you isn't here.
You need something, Dark One.
Tell me what it is.
All I need is your trust. I promise.
I liked you the way you were.
I liked your walls.
I liked being the one to break them down.
The person you found inside is still me.
I have a question for you for once.
Do you love me?
If you tell me you don't love me, I will let you go.
I loved you.
I guess I'm either steering home or swimming home.
Tell me which.
The ship's yours.
David, what is it?
The toadstool. It's gone.
Either the Phantom Knights took it,
or it was lost in the bog.
We could search for it.
No.
It's gone.
The word "quest" means to seek, not to find.
It's the seeking that matters.
You believe that?
Not truly, no.
If the finding is what makes a difference in this world,
then that's what I want.
I'm sorry.
My father, he drank his life away.
My brother accomplished nothing but evil.
There was a time I thought I'd be different.
Change the world.
But I just...
I don't want to only be remembered as the man
who kissed a sleeping princess awake 30 years ago.
I understand.
You do?
You're king of Camelot.
Yes, some large rock decided I was a hero.
Prophecy fulfilled.
But since then, I've had victories and I've had losses.
And I've learned that it's the losses
that require us to be brave.
So, if anything will make us heroes...
It's the never giving up. Even after a loss.
Indeed.
Well, we might as well get out of here.
There's work to be done.
And it's not here.
Good man.
David, if you want to be part of something,
do something that matters,
I have a place for a man like you.
I never saw a bean.
Just forget the bean for now.
Just tell us why you took these things.
I was tired of how I was being treated --
how we were all being treated.
Breaking our backs for him, for love of Camelot.
I wanted to hurt the king.
Grif, I had no idea.
But, you see, you've hurt everyone.
We need that bean to get home.
I didn't see a bean, your majesty.
I'm always betrayed by those closest to me.
Look, you know this guy. Is he lying?
I don't believe so.
And of course, it is possible there was no bean
if it was removed during the six weeks we can't recall.
Okay, well, we'll find another way to get you home.
Working together?
Absolutely.
Let's go tell this guy he's gonna make his home
in our cell for a little while.
What's this?
Must've fallen out when we emptied his bag.
If that was in the trunk, it was added after the time we lost.
I recognize this.
That's the one in the book from Camelot.
The one I found this morning.
That's what we were looking for back there.
But why?
It's used to communicate through magical barriers.
We must've been trying to communicate with Merlin.
I wonder if we did.
Let's use it. Let's find out. If we can talk to him now --
He can help us save Emma from being the Dark One.
David, you did it.
I dub thee Sir David of the Enchanted Forest.
Now of the Round Table.
I know "Knight of the Round Table" is pale fire, indeed,
next to the title of prince.
No. I am beyond honored.
Then rise, Sir Knight. Take your place.
Really?
I never thought I'd find anyone I trust enough
to fill that seat.
But it's yours.
It will bear your coat of arms.
Not bad for a shepherd, eh?
Thank you.
Someone there?
Can't be.
It is.
Lancelot. We thought you were dead.
That is a long story.
But trust your eyes -- it is me.
And right now, my struggles don't matter.
What does is that there is a terrible villain in Camelot.
The Dark One.
We know. It's our daughter. We're going to fix it.
No.
There's another villain.
Arthur.
What?
Trust me.
Camelot is not what it seems.
Today was a difficult day.
You lied to him, to David.
And it brought me no pleasure.
He's a good man.
A noble man, but I must think of my kingdom first.
Of course you must.
That is always the burden of a king.
Your majesty, thank goodness you're here.
I-I don't understand what's going on.
I did only what you asked.
I took the items, and I kept them safe.
I said maybe there was a bean,
even though you and I know full well there was never a bean,
and I did it exactly as you said.
Can you please let me out now?
Not just yet, Grif.
There may not have been a bean,
but we can't have them learning that, now, can we?
No. No, of course not, your majesty.
They trust me now.
So I must use that trust to protect my kingdom.
These people may seem friendly,
but they threaten everything we hold dear.
David likes to imagine his quest a noble one.
But his daughter is the Dark One.
They lied to us in Camelot.
They brought her into our castle.
They are responsible for tearing us away from our home,
a home we must now reclaim.
But how will we ever get back without a bean?
I'm afraid we cannot get back.
That's why we must build a new Camelot here in Storybrooke.
Then you can trust me to help.
I would do anything for my kingdom.
I know you would. As would I.
Which is why I need you to drink this.
Poison from the Agrabah vipers.
But why?
I won't tell these people a thing.
Not of your own free will, but they have magic on their side.
In time, they will make you talk.
There must be some other way.
I wish there was. Truly, I do.
You told me you always dreamed
of sitting at the round table one day.
Well, now I'm offering you something greater.
A chance to die in service of Camelot.
Your death will be
the cornerstone of a great new kingdom.
If you take this.
For Camelot.
For Camelot.
Good, you're still here.
You need me?
Yeah.
Remember how I told you about that door in emma's place?
I want to know what's behind it.
I take it asking her didn't work.
She's beyond that. I need a thief.
Former thief. Those days are behind me.
Take it from a former pirate, those days are never behind you.
Will you help me?
Granny, have you got my lunch ready?
Yeah, but, girl, you're gonna need more than that.
Sit down for some real food.
I can't.
Oh, my god, look.
Yeah, I have to get back to him.
Just forget the soup. I'm sorry.
Hang on, is it supposed to do that?
What?
He's waking up.
You know, he doesn't look too good...
if I do say so myself.
Quite a stroke of luck,
you finding something that touched him when he was a man.
It wasn't luck. I worked hard for this.
That's true.
You crushed Hook's heart even more firmly
under your, uh, impractical boot heel.
Quiet.
What do you want from me?
You are the Dark One now, not me.
That's right.
You are not dark. You are also not light.
You are nothing.
Your heart is a blank slate.
And that, little man, makes you useful.
Because now I can make you
into the last thing you ever thought you would be.
A hero.
And not just any hero.
The purest who's ever lived.
And then...
And then I have a job for you.
