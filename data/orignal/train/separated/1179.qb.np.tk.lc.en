guys , over there there was a hoodie watching us . there .
what if &quot; a &quot; put garrett &apos;s mom in the hospital
to get garrett out of jail ?
i &apos;m done , hanna .
are you breaking up with me ?
spencer , you were right .
i &apos;m withdrawing the reward .
the truth always comes out , jason .
meet me in the parking lot in 15 minutes .
we know that somewhere between being with us and getting to alison &apos;s grave ,
you were with jenna .
we just have to find out what happened that night .
my boss volunteered the bank staff to help out
at a rummage sale at the church .
em , i just found the gray jacket from that night .
it just came out of a donation box .
are you here without an assistant ?
i &apos;m in the market if you know anyone who &apos;s interested ...
i &apos;m interested .
he &apos;s writing a note for the flowers .
his mom is in a coma . she &apos;s not doing a lot of reading .
hanna , slow down . you almost tripped over
a catheter back there that was still attached to someone .
312 , 312 ...
there it is .
we need to have a plan .
we have a plan . exposing &quot; a. &quot;
inside voice . okay .
what is the plan exactly ?
we &apos;re going to replace garrett &apos;s note
with a fake note that we wrote .
i know that part . i came up with it , remember ?
yes , i wonder why you were asking me that ?
but we still need a place to lead &quot; a. &quot;
rosewood church , by the organ in the main sanctuary , tonight .
how did you come up with that ?
i have been living there since my mom signed me up to
sort through spandex shorts and granny panties .
but won &apos;t the church be locked ?
that &apos;s the point . it &apos;s deserted at night .
so when lucas shows up
it &apos;s not gonna be lucas !
yes , it will , han , he had the pills .
fine !
then i &apos;ll show up with a paddle
and finish what i started at the lake .
what happened to the girl who wouldn &apos;t get out of her sweats ?
she traded them for fatigues . i &apos;ll write that .
are you sure you know how ?
yes .
i &apos;ve been forging my mom &apos;s signature since seventh grade in p.e.
wow . this is really good .
yell if you see anyone , all right ?
are you sure that you want to do it ?
this &quot; a &quot; broke me and caleb up , do you understand ?
they &apos;re gonna have to pay for that .
mrs. reynolds ?
blue team to i.c.u.
blue team to i.c.u.
go ! go ! go go go ! come on !
blue team to i.c.u.
blue team to i.c.u.
it &apos;s on the border of box county , i think it &apos;s the first exit .
hmm ? oh . yeah , i found it .
why aren &apos;t you going with laurel ?
she &apos;s just weird about driving with strangers .
you &apos;re not a stranger , you &apos;re her assistant .
what &apos;s up ?
laurel was just double @-@ checking that i had the right address .
how bad do you think it would be if i canceled ?
canceled on your first day of work ?
i don &apos;t think you &apos;d get a second .
yeah . that &apos;s what i figured .
i don &apos;t understand . why would you want to do that ?
i thought you were excited about this job .
no , i am .
i really am . it &apos;s just ...
hanna &apos;s still really torn up over caleb ,
so we were all gonna get together tonight
to try and cheer her up .
your friends know it &apos;s a great opportunity for you .
besides , we gotta pool our resources together .
i think we &apos;re on our last package of ramen .
what is this really about ?
aria ...
you wouldn &apos;t have been hired
if she didn &apos;t think you were up to the task .
hey , look up .
don &apos;t .
boom .
ezra , seriously .
okay , your turn .
what ?
i want to remind you that you know what you &apos;re doing .
so come on , take a picture of me .
are you happy ?
no . keep going .
&quot; the thinker . &quot;
gorgeous .
okay , come on . you gotta give me something else .
running in place ?
you gotta give me more .
so i went and showed her the place ,
and she said she loved it .
i think i did a good job .
once i finish putting the beams in the loft ,
she said they &apos;d be interested for me doing some custom work for them .
that &apos;s great .
she even gave my name to an architect she knows .
that--that &apos;s great .
spencer .
hmm ?
you &apos;re doing it again .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know that i &apos;ve been a little bit distracted recently .
i just ... i have so much on my plate .
i have this project that &apos;s due on monday .
okay . okay .
i &apos;ll let you work .
thank you .
i &apos;ll just sit next to you and i &apos;ll watch you type .
i &apos;ll be very quiet .
okay .
mm . that &apos;s not ...
distracting at all .
just do you know .
hi ! dad ! how was your run ?
it was fine .
i miss the days when you ran with me .
i guess--
i guess i &apos;ll take off .
i &apos;ll call you later , okay ?
where &apos;s mom ?
she , uh , had to work today .
on what case ?
she got called in early .
time @-@ sensitive issue .
dad , you didn &apos;t answer my question .
don &apos;t needle me , spencer . i &apos;m not the one working on it .
so it is garrett &apos;s case .
i know how crazy you get about this stuff .
so what happened ?
i shouldn &apos;t have brought it up .
i brought it up .
you &apos;re gonna read about it in the papers anyway .
turns out the physical evidence that the
police had on garrett reynolds ,
well , it ... it can &apos;t be re @-@ tested .
why not ?
they either don &apos;t have enough
of it or what they do have has been tainted .
something along those lines .
why do they even have to re @-@ test it ?
if it tested positively the first time--
all i know is that your mother is pushing for the judge
to rule the evidence inadmissible ,
and it looks like she &apos;s gonna get what she wants . as usual .
but if they can &apos;t use it--
isn &apos;t the prosecution relying on this evidence ?
without it they won &apos;t have a case !
that &apos;s what your mother &apos;s hoping .
where are you going ?
out !
thanks .
hey . did you get my text ?
i haven &apos;t had time to sneeze .
how &apos;d it go ? did spence replace the note ?
no . i did it .
but you &apos;re scared of old people .
yeah , and apparently they &apos;re scared of me too .
i touch the woman and she nearly croaked .
what happened ?
look , i came to give you this .
it &apos;s the pick @-@ up location of the bag that your jacket came from .
is this even in rosewood ?
no , but i thought we &apos;d go tomorrow and check it out .
why not today ?
because after you &apos;re done working
we &apos;re going straight to the church .
meet me at home ? yeah , i &apos;ll see you later .
so what &apos;s up ?
i need to talk to you about garrett . his case .
then you know-- about the evidence .
so it has been thrown out ?
not yet , but it will be .
look , i think i might have a way to make sure
that garrett &apos;s case doesn &apos;t fall apart .
but i &apos;m at a dead end , and at this point
the only person who might be able to help me is you .
what can i do ?
do you know somebody named april rose ?
so you &apos;ve never heard of her ?
how is it going hanna ?
would you believe i used to wear a pair just like these ?
with a suede french vest .
wanted to look like cat stevens .
well , if i find a hat with a squirrel tail on it ,
i &apos;ll let you know .
um , that &apos;s davey crockett , and i &apos;d be wearing a raccoon cap .
looks like you &apos;ve got an interesting system going .
oh . yeah , i &apos;m organizing them into seasons .
we have fall , winter , spring , summer ...
resort .
oh . how innovative .
is your mom coming today ?
no , she can &apos;t . she had to take the car in .
oh . well , i guess i &apos;ll see you at the party tonight .
what party ?
i made an announcement about it like 15 minutes ago .
the council throws it for the volunteers as a way of saying thanks .
oh . well , thanks but no thanks . i &apos;m busy .
too bad .
you haven &apos;t partied until
you &apos;ve partied in the church rec room .
wait .
the--the party &apos;s tonight ?
here ? at the church ?
wanna change your plans now , don &apos;t you ?
but to be honest , there were
so many girls hanging around us at the time
i could have met her and not even known it .
and by &quot; us , &quot; you mean ...
garrett , ian and i.
right . the n.a.t. club .
how &apos;d you know about that ?
do you think that she could
have been one of the girls that you filmed ?
well , i didn &apos;t film any of those videos .
yeah , but you watched them . didn &apos;t you ?
how did you get that honor without doing any of the grunt work ?
it was my idea .
look , like i said before , i was messed up .
high school was just one big blur .
do you think she could have been in one of the videos ?
it &apos;s possible .
or maybe she was just one of their &quot; employees . &quot;
what does that mean ?
i think ian and garrett were paying girls
to set up their friends .
i don &apos;t know . at that time i had kind of walked away from it all .
so were you guys the only members ?
officially ? yeah .
but ian had help .
there &apos;s no way he could have filmed it all on his own .
you know at times , i even thought
maybe he was filming it for someone else .
i &apos;ll catch up with you later .
yeah .
hey , ezra , i &apos;m gonna have to run .
wait--right this minute ?
not so fast .
at least give me a proper goodbye .
bye .
bye .
i can &apos;t believe you asked him that .
we have to find this girl ,
and if anybody knows who she is , it &apos;s jason .
well , he doesn &apos;t .
he might not have recognized her name ,
but he could recognize her by a picture .
i wonder if april was the
type of girl who pimped out her friends .
i don &apos;t know .
all i know is that the prosecution &apos;s case is crumbling ,
and we have to get to this girl before &quot; a &quot; does .
whatever garrett wants destroyed
could be the only thing left that keeps him in jail .
do you think maya found those tapes
with ali &apos;s stuff ?
it &apos;s possible . maybe that &apos;s what garrett was after all along .
maybe april rose has a tape .
maybe that &apos;s what garrett wants &quot; a &quot; to destroy .
what i don &apos;t get is why would &quot; a &quot; take direction from garrett ?
it might be the other way around .
garrett might have done whatever &quot; a &quot; told him to
and that &apos;s how he wound up behind bars .
hey . sorry i &apos;m late .
finally . i &apos;m starving .
me too .
do you want to split some cheese fries ?
no , i want my own .
so , the plan &apos;s changed for tonight .
it &apos;s not a plan , it &apos;s a suicide mission .
the church is gonna be crawling with people ,
so we &apos;re not gonna be able to figure out who &quot; a &quot; is .
emily and i are gonna hide
behind the organ and just see who shows up .
i don &apos;t think that you should ...
spencer ,
it &apos;s not about confronting , okay ?
i just want to see who it
is so i &apos;ll know how to plan a real attack .
&quot; we . &quot; when we attack .
just be careful . and wear sensible shoes .
hey , i wear three inches or i wear nothing .
oh , and order me a side salad . to soak up the cheese .
what &apos;s with you ? you &apos;re acting like a pod person .
oh . i--
i was just trying to remember
how much reward money jason offered .
$ 50,000 . why ?
and that was cash , right ?
yeah .
did he just have all that money lying around his house ?
well , i doubt it .
but if someone did , would that be weird ?
if you had that much cash lying around ,
you &apos;d probably also have a bomb shelter
and like five years &apos; worth of dehydrated meat .
or you &apos;re a criminal .
i do want my own cheese fries .
need to talk to you . it &apos;s about spencer .
jason . please , leave her out of this .
i need her energy focused on her future ,
not this trial .
maybe you should tell your wife that .
jason , you &apos;re wrong about veronica .
she didn &apos;t take this case out of spite .
she doesn &apos;t hate you .
well , no , i don &apos;t think he hates me .
i think she hates you .
look ...
i don &apos;t want my daughter &apos;s life derailed any further .
she needs to find a way to , you know , put this behind her .
the trial , your sister--
which sister exactly are you talking about ?
because as it turns out , i had more than one .
finally . let &apos;s go .
uh--hey , let me introduce you to the art of conversation .
&quot; hi ! how was your day ? &quot;
&quot; my day was fine . how was yours ? &quot;
i &apos;m sorry . i just want to leave .
i should say hi to ted .
uh , can we not ?
that goober is literally trying to be my best friend .
hanna , being kind and decent doesn &apos;t make ted a &quot; goober . &quot;
i know . it &apos;s the fact that he says &quot; howdy &quot;
and wears clothes made of roadkill .
what is up with you ?
well , now that you mention it , i &apos;m goober &apos;s date tonight .
what ? when did this happen ?
he called this morning .
and you said yes ? !
no . mom . i-- i &apos;m sorry , you can &apos;t go .
why not ?
because i &apos;m going to be there , and that &apos;ll be weird .
hanna , you &apos;re not ten years old ,
we don &apos;t need to hold hands .
but i thought it might be nice if we could drive together .
no , we can &apos;t , because ....
toby &apos;s picking me up .
he &apos;s taking me to the dance .
why is spencer &apos;s boyfriend taking you to the dance ?
is this about you wanting to hurt caleb ?
no , it &apos;s--
there &apos;s this ... guy , another volunteer ,
and he just won &apos;t take no for an answer ,
so i thought if i take toby ,
then maybe he &apos;ll finally leave me alone .
is this something i should be concerned about ?
no . he &apos;s just some do @-@ gooder creep .
he &apos;s harmless .
it &apos;s actually called &quot; the thank you dance &quot; ?
who cares what it &apos;s called , spencer .
can you get toby to come with me or not ?
han , it &apos;s bad enough that i canceled a date with him
without forcing him to go on one with you .
i don &apos;t want him involved .
involved ?
he just has to stand there and eat chips .
i don &apos;t understand though .
why couldn &apos;t you just come up with a better lie ?
i &apos;m sorry . i panicked , all right ?
it was like my mouth was talking before my brain could catch up .
you can make fun of me all you want ,
but this whole plan is falling apart !
you don &apos;t think that i &apos;m taking this seriously ?
i &apos;ve spent every waking moment
searching for this april girl .
i &apos;ve been in the library so much ,
i am on a first @-@ name basis with the homeless guy
that sleeps next to the microfiche .
what is this ?
police academy rosters .
i thought maybe april and garrett went through training together .
you think that another cop could help him get away with murder ?
like wilden ?
i don &apos;t know .
han , i thought that we were done with all this .
yeah , me too .
you know , last year ... when things got really bad
i used to fantasize about what my life would be like
if i had never met ali .
my biggest concern right now would be where i wanted to go to college .
i &apos;ve had that fantasy too .
yeah , but every time i go down that road ,
i have to remind myself that if i hadn &apos;t met her ,
then i wouldn &apos;t be friends with you .
so what time should toby pick you up ?
seven @-@ thirty .
okay . now go , so i can keep looking through all this .
oh , and spence--
we &apos;ll get there , okay ?
we &apos;ve stopped mona ,
and we can stop this person .
it &apos;s now or never .
i know . it &apos;s the &quot; never &quot; part that i &apos;m afraid of .
托比是我的男伴 稍后跟你解释
more coffee ?
i &apos;m done , thanks .
she doesn &apos;t look so good .
better get her home before she passes out .
found april rose .
did you talk to her ?
it &apos;s not a &quot; her . &quot; it &apos;s an &quot; it . &quot;
you &apos;re driving .
you want some punch ?
um ... oh , no thank you .
i don &apos;t drink anything that &apos;s not shrink @-@ wrapped .
so who am i here to scare off ?
what ?
the creep that &apos;s been bothering you ... ?
oh ! right . um--
yeah , it &apos;s that guy over there .
hi , sweetie .
hi , toby .
hi , ms. marin .
toby , this is ted .
howdy .
nice to meet you .
me too . you &apos;re a very lucky man .
what ? ! no . no , we &apos;re--we &apos;re not-- um , yeah .
we &apos;re just friends .
what do you say we try to find the grown @-@ up beverages ?
don &apos;t kill the messenger , but they &apos;re not serving alcohol .
oh . right . church .
maybe we should find someone with a beard
who can do that whole turning @-@ water @-@ into @-@ wine thing .
if not , would you settle for a root beer ?
do you think it will ferment if we let it stand long enough ?
toby , come on .
oh . hi .
good evening .
good evening , folks .
i &apos;m getting ready to close . uh ...
how can i help you ?
we just came in to pick up something that might have been set aside ?
were you asked to hold anything ?
half this shop .
but i &apos;m not holding my breath anybody &apos;s coming back .
well , you see , a friend of ours dropped something off
and asked us to pick it up .
but we don &apos;t know exactly what it is ,
and our friend can &apos;t be reached .
okay , so we can go classic with &quot; when harry met sally , &quot;
we can watch &quot; the notebook &quot; for , like , the millionth time .
i don &apos;t care . you can decide .
that &apos;s really pretty .
don &apos;t you love finding new places to wear jewelry ?
i &apos;m never taking it off .
who gave it to you ?
no one special .
just another one of the nameless , faceless
revolving door of boyfriends who adore you ?
no . just a friend .
i ... am going out .
are you kidding ?
my friend has a guy who can get us i.d.s.
i &apos;m going to a party to pick him up , and then i &apos;ll be back .
this is so typical . every time we make plans ,
if something better comes along , you totally ditch me .
why are you spazzing ?
i &apos;m making sure we have the best summer ever .
instead of languishing at the kiddie table ,
we &apos;ll be mixing up on futons with frat boys .
i gotta go . my friend &apos;s here .
which friend ?
you don &apos;t know her .
you &apos;re sure this is it ?
i &apos;m positive .
she never took it off .
uh , how much do you want for this ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve never seen that before .
i just found it on this mannequin .
must have been brought in here in the past couple of days .
and you don &apos;t happen to know who dropped it off ?
it &apos;s--
there &apos;s no code , no tags .
i can &apos;t sell it to you folks . it &apos;s a display piece .
how about if i give you a hundred dollars ?
it &apos;s not my decision to make .
will two hundred make it your decision ?
four hundred .
where are you ?
i &apos;m sorry , i got held up .
well , get here .
i can &apos;t face &quot; a &quot; alone .
toby &apos;s getting suspicious , and wilden is hovering .
wilden &apos;s there ? okay , i &apos;m leaving in five .
here you are .
do you want to dance ?
no , thanks .
all right , then .
wait . toby .
when you reach the summit ,
all you can hear is the wind whistling through the rocks .
sounds ... incredible .
i &apos;d love to take you .
if ... you &apos;re interested .
how about next sunday ?
well , sunday &apos;s kind of a busy day for me .
okay . sunday after that ?
ah , the thing is , i &apos;m busy every sunday .
i thought hanna must have told you . i &apos;m a pastor ?
well , an associate pastor .
no . she didn &apos;t .
more root beer ?
yeah .
hanna ... why am i here ?
i told you . that guy--
i know , you told me . but that kid is scared of his own shadow ,
and he &apos;s definitely scared of yours .
so why am i here ?
or maybe the question is : why are you ?
i told you . i wanted to go to a party .
hanna , i have had naps more exciting
than this party , and so have you .
does this have to do with caleb ?
no .
in a way .
hanna .
i need to talk to you for a second . now .
i &apos;m really sorry , toby . i &apos;ll be right back , okay ?
hey . can you call me ?
i &apos;m about to leave this church ... thing .
and i need to know why you and hanna lied to me .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ted was a pastor ?
he is ?
hanna , i have just replayed the last hour in my head ,
and i am this close to crawling under a pew .
oh , my gosh . you really like him .
it &apos;s too late . i blew it .
no , you didn &apos;t .
i made that joke about them not serving booze .
you like your wine .
i wore a dress with cleavage !
mom , that is practically a turtleneck .
hanna , all it takes is one glance at my resume
to know that i am no angel .
who is ?
oh . hey , holden .
so , uh , is your whole crew coming tonight ?
no . just me and hanna . have you seen her ?
yeah , she &apos;s , uh ...
around here somewhere .
hey , relax . have a cupcake .
when did you get that tattoo ?
oh , it &apos;s not a ...
is that for a club ?
not a club so much as a party .
it changes venues .
you know , i--
actually , i used to see your friend there sometimes .
w @-@ what friend ?
your girlfriend ?
maya ?
hey , i gotta go .
oh , there you are .
sorry .
just wanted to check on hanna .
and how is she ?
she &apos;s good .
so , do you want to dance ?
i &apos;d love to , but word of warning ,
my dance moves start at &quot; the running man &quot; and end at the &quot; roger rabbit . &quot;
hey , there , ashley .
pastor .
detective wilden , right ?
that &apos;s right , but i &apos;m off the clock .
so am i. it &apos;s ted .
i &apos;m happy to see you here , if a little surprised .
that &apos;s funny , i was just
about to say the same thing to ms. marin .
you two know each other ?
sure .
we haven &apos;t seen each other in a while .
detective wilden was an important part of the
alison dilaurentis case .
hanna was a good friend of hers . so our paths have crossed .
and they &apos;ll probably cross again .
anyway , have a good evening .
now , where were we ?
oh , that &apos;s right . i was just about to humiliate myself
on the dance floor .
i &apos;m sorry , ted . i just got hit with a searing headache .
can i get you some aspirin ?
no .
then maybe we should sit down for a little ...
thank you .
i think i should just go home .
uh , sure .
let me walk you to the car .
hey , can you call me ?
i &apos;m about to leave this church ... thing .
and i need to know why you and hanna lied to me .
hey . how did it go ?
as well as it could , i guess .
i told &apos; em i got an anonymous tip
and they seemed to believe me .
so when will we know when--
no . he didn &apos;t say .
what do we do now ?
now we wait .
um ... do you still have those letters ?
the ones that helped you figure out that my dad is our dad .
yeah .
may i see them ?
oh , spencer . you don &apos;t want to do that .
it &apos;ll just .. hurt .
what ?
nothing . i was ...
just thinking about how different you are from ali .
i mean , the reason that
you don &apos;t want me to see them is
the very reason that she would want me to .
i wonder what kind of person she would have turned into .
i mean , i see it with the kids i work with , you know .
and at first they &apos;re all attitude ,
but you peel back the layers and ,
you usually find a person underneath .
yeah , but with ali ,
i &apos;d keep peeling , i just ...
always seemed to find new layers .
emily . where have you been ?
i just had the weirdest conversation with holden .
what ? when were you with--
i remembered something from that night ,
and it might have something to do with maya .
holden seemed to know , but he walked away .
well , let &apos;s find him .
i don &apos;t know where he went .
just go wait by the side door , okay ?
i want to get there before &quot; a &quot; does .
is this yours ?
no . i &apos;ve never seen it before .
don &apos;t lie to me , hanna .
a nurse found this ,
and wisely handed it over to the police .
i don &apos;t know what that is .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re here for some peace and quiet .
i was looking for someone .
who ?
why are you helping him ?
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re talking about
yeah , you do ,
but i &apos;ll play along .
all that fuss you girls made , pointing the finger at ian .
was that all for garrett &apos;s sake ?
i have nothing to do with that .
i don &apos;t get it , hanna .
why are you in his corner ?
my mom &apos;s downstairs .
your mom left .
you know , i bet when she
was your age she caused a lot of problems .
but .. .she knows how to get rid of problems .
all you do is create &apos; em .
i &apos;ve gotta go .
there &apos;s people he has to answer to .
you always stand up for him , don &apos;t ya ?
did everything go okay at work today ?
yeah .
no .
not at all , actually .
i dropped two light meters , i switched out a wrong lens
and i punctured her mounts .
really ?
yeah .
what happened ?
well , i was a little distracted ...
by what i found in your sock drawer .
it that why you ran out of here today ?
yeah . i didn &apos;t know what to say .
i can see how that might look ... pretty bad .
ezra , where did that money come from ?
i sold a car my grandfather left me .
a sixty @-@ seven jag .
i was hoping to restore it one day ,
but now someone else has it
and i have a sock drawer with no socks .
and they paid you in cash ?
yeah , i let the guy pay
me in cash so he could have a break on taxes .
um , o @-@ okay . why didn &apos;t you just tell me that ?
well , i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be going through my sock drawer .
i wasn &apos;t going through your sock drawer--
because it &apos;s embarrassing .
okay ? six months ago i was a professor ,
and now i &apos;m answering want ads for webzines and--
and reusing coffee filters .
can i join you ?
when you &apos;re loyal to a man , hewie ,
you &apos;re loyal to everything about him ...
even his faults ...
even his son .
good morning .
is it ?
i wanted to talk to you .
yeah . i figured you and mom would want to have a chat .
your mom &apos;s already left .
an important piece of evidence
in the reynolds case was turned in last night .
but i imagine you already knew that .
now , spence , the police have been
looking for that anklet for two years .
i didn &apos;t know that .
they didn &apos;t tell the family , and they kept it out of the press .
but you and jason managed to find it .
i don &apos;t know how ,
but there it is .
the anklet had trace amounts of blood still on it--
alison &apos;s and someone else &apos;s .
that blood has been ruled out as belonging to garrett reynolds .
what--what do you mean ?
they don &apos;t know whose it is ,
but they know it &apos;s not his .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s not possible .
spencer , the judge threw out the case .
i &apos;ll take you to school .
spencer ?
