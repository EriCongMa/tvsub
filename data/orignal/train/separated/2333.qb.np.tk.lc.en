my wife isabel spent her life researching
paranormal activity in this area .
where is your wife ?
damon killed her .
there is a tomb underneath the church .
the spell sealed katherine in that tomb , protecting her .
i am gonna bring her back .

阿橙 紫尾猫 小鹏有 内丘 默默
hey , bonnie , it &apos;s me just checking in ,
seeing how you &apos;re doing .
we miss you here .
don &apos;t let your aunt drive you too crazy .
come home soon .
love you .
what are you doin &apos; out here ?
it &apos;s cold .
thinking , writing .
the , uh , funeral for bonnie &apos;s grandma ,
brought back a lot of mum and dad .
i was wondering you said you were doing
dome digging about them ,
the adoption .
right .
so did you dig ?
come on inside .
your dad kept everything from his medical practice--
records , logs , old appointment books .
i found an entry from the night you born
patient and a birth date .
isobel peterson .
do you think that &apos;s her real name ?
pregnant teenage runaway ?
probably not . first name , maybe .
but where &apos;d she get peterson ?
classmate ? best friend ?
so i binged it .
i searched for all the petersons in this area
born the same year as isobel , found 3--
2 men and a woman , trudie ,
who lived in grove hill , virginia .
that &apos;s not far from here .
well , watch this .
isobel .
she was a cheerleader .
trudie still lives there .
this is her address .
what about isobel ?
i couldn &apos;t find angthing about her .
listen . there &apos;s something else .
mr. saltzman , rick ,
his wife was from around here ,
and her name was also isobel .
wait
&quot; was &quot; as an ..
she died .
alaric &apos;s wife might have been your mother ?
it can &apos;t be true , right ?
i mean , the coincidence alone is just crazy .
i have the address for her friend trudie .
you wanna talk to her ?
i--i don &apos;t know , i ...
i--i don &apos;t know .
if it &apos;s true and they are the same person ,
that means that my birth mother is dead ,
and i don &apos;t know if i could handle that .
elena , did jenna tell you anything about alaric &apos;s wife ?
how she died ?
just she was killed and case was never solved
you knew that already ?
the night at the school when he attacked me ,
he told me some things about her death .
well--
no , no .
it &apos;s not possible .
the coincidence is-- it &apos;s too much .
now , listen , if you do decide to go
talk to isobel &apos;s friend ,
i &apos;ll go with you . ok ?
i just don &apos;t know how gonna do yet
i should get goin &apos; .
i gotta go deal with damon .
how &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s dealing in his own way .
how do i taste ?
oh , so much better than your friends .
but shh . don &apos;t tell them .
they might get jealous .
no . buzzkill bob .
greetings
can we talk ?
yeah .
without the tri @-@ delts .
anything you have to say to me ,
you can say in front of them .
they &apos;re really good at keeping secrets .
you &apos;re worried about me .
that &apos;s nice . don &apos;t be .
there &apos;s no need . i &apos;m fine . why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
it &apos;s almost 145 years of one goal get in that tomb .
i succeeded .
granted , katherine wasn &apos;t in there to be rescued ,
but why dwell ?
no , it &apos;s so liberating not having a master plan ,
because i can do whatever the hell i want .
that &apos;s kind of what i &apos;m afraid of .
relax . i haven &apos;t killed anyone in-- too long .
those girls
end up their dorm with headaches ,
think they blacked out .
business as usual .
predictable you didn &apos;t
pull me over here for a pep talk .
so drink up . spill it , brother .
there was a woman you may have known a few years back
named isobel ,
most came round here from duke
you wanna discuss the woman in my past
seriously
you killed her .
what &apos;s your point ?
i just--just wanna know
if you remember anything about her .
oh , it &apos;s like a needle in a haystack , stefan .
well , think hard . it &apos;s important .
nothing is important , not anymore .
great job
i have to go
and exploit some women in the name of grief
which i &apos;m sure you understand .
&quot; ttfn , &quot; said the tri @-@ delt . heh .
what ?
this is boring . i &apos;m bored .
but we have this entire house to ourselves
i mean , it &apos;s practically a bachelor pad .
and ...
so shouldn &apos;t we do something
a little bit more bachelor @-@ paddy ?
what ? something like this ?
something like that
i don &apos;t know .
this is a pretty good show .
seriously ?
oh god
not on my couch .
mom .
hey .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just weird , you know ,
me being raffled off like a disney cruise .
in this town ,
fundraising is like indentured servitude .
you don &apos;t have a choice .
besides , you are bachelor and you are eligible
so there you go
with this .
oh , god . i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m gonna do this .
what
i am totally gonna ruin this moment
but i have to tell you
elena recently found out she was adopted ,
and she &apos;s been looking for her birth mother ...
whose name was isobel .
isobel ? like my wife ?
isobel never had a baby .
are you sure ?
not before you were together ?
nope . no way .
this is elena &apos;s birth mother .
ah , she , uh--
she never told me .
i gonna go .
trudie ?
tru @-@ trudie peterson ?
yes .
uh , my name is elena gilbert .
i wanted to talk to you about isobel flemming .
well , i haven &apos;t heard that name in years .
how do you know her ?
i think that , um , well ...
do you know she had a baby
that she gave up for adoption .
my god .
you &apos;re her daughter .
i was just gonna make some tea . would you like some ?
sure .
uh , the kitchen &apos;s this way .
i wasn &apos;t gonna come . i didn &apos;t think i was ,
but i was driving , and i hit this stoplight ,
and it made me think about when i was learning
how to drive and then my mom would always warn me
about this blind turn on the left @-@ hand side ,
and then i was thinking about my mom , and--
i have your address ,
i &apos;m sorry for barging in
it &apos;s no problem .
um , just a surprise , though .
i haven &apos;t thought about isobel in years .
when was the last time you saw her ?
about 17 years ago ,
when she left to go have you .
we kept in touch for a while ,
but , well , you know , people drift apart .
and you don &apos;t know where she ended up ?
she was in florida for a while .
she was on her own , you know , she wasn &apos;t easy .
do you have any idea who my father is ?
i could never get her to fess up .
anyway , she finally pulled it together ,
got into college on a scholarship .
where did she go ?
somewhere in carolina . duke , i think .
smart girl , smart school .
let me just grab that .
so it &apos;s been a few month , where have you been ?
well , here and there . never one place too long .
you know pete .
no , actually , i don &apos;t ,
because you never brought him around .
so blonde &apos;s the new flavor of the month , huh ?
so sorry i scared her off .
she &apos;s not a flavor , mom . i like her .
so she &apos;s the one ?
no , probably not , but maybe .
matt , seriously ,
liz forbes &apos;s daughter .
mom , seriously . knock it off .
ice , please .
so , uh , you heard from vic ?
no , but don &apos;t worry .
she will come home eventually when she needs something .
i played that game .
are you playing it now ?
no . then what are you doin &apos; home ?
you trying to say i need a reason to come back ?
sit down . eat with me .
tell me everything i &apos;ve missed , hmm .
thanks for meeting me .
something &apos;s come up .
jenna told you .
yeah .
so it &apos;s true .
your wife isobel was elena &apos;s birth mother .
what does elena know ?
about your wife ?
about everything . about you , your brother .
she knows what i am ,
and she knows that you know about the vampires .
does she know about damon and isobel ?
no . i couldn &apos;t tell her until i was sure .
you said you &apos;d help me .
i asked damon without saying too much .
he doesn &apos;t remember .
ask him again .
damon is not stable right now .
you know , he murdered my wife
or at the very least made a meal out of her .
when has he been stable ?
i &apos;m telling you not to push this .
give me a reason not to .
your survival . how &apos;s that for a reason ?
i &apos;ll handle it , but for now , i need you to let it go .
is what you tell elena ?
let it go ?
leave elena out of this .
i need to know what happened .
i think you would , too .
i need something more than just your wife &apos;s
name pictures about everthing of damon .
just a few more minutes .
can &apos;t you , uh--
can &apos;t you fix it at morning
i like working in night .
yes i like sleeping in night . with you .
ok , i &apos;ll bite .
what is it , thesis stuff ?
look , baby , i &apos;m in a 3 @-@ way here with you and your computer ,
the least you can do is let me know what you &apos;re up to .
i was doing research ,
and i dug up all this stuff
about this small town in virginia near where i grew up .
it &apos;s isolated , out of the way , and quiet ,
and every now and then , people die mysteriously ,
and they say that it &apos;s animal attacks .
except , these bodies are drained of blood .
it &apos;s vampires and it has to be .
i &apos;ll get my garlic and holy water ,
and then maybe , just maybe ...
no .
we can get some sleep .
come here .
no .
look , this is why i love you ,
because you believe in all of this stuff ,
so much so that you &apos;re making a degree out of it .
you &apos;re like mulder except hotter than a girl
this is not a joke , rick .
you think that this is cute ,
but i &apos;m gonna prove it .
and mulder was right in the end .
they came to the game for us .
the football team hadn &apos;t won in years .
we were the stars .
well , izzie was .
but i was a damn good backup .
heh . this is great . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
you haven &apos;t touched your tea .
what is this ?
oh , it &apos;s just some herbal mixture
vervain ?
you know .
know what ?
you didn &apos;t invite me in ,
and you &apos;re serving vervain tea .
you know .
i think that you should probably leave .
wait . what are you not telling me ?
please , leave
now .
bourbon .
behold , the teacher
dancing , paper degree ?
it &apos;s , uh , more fun with a buzz .
well , most things in life are .
sober &apos;s depressing .
you don &apos;t strike me as somebody who gets depressed .
you say that like you know me .
just a hunch .
you have a good afternoon .
not likely .
daytime drinking , huh ?
it &apos;s all the rage .
listen , i need a favor .
you ever been in love ?
excuse me ?
have you ever been so bent on someone ,
that you just have your heart ripped out by them ?
you forget i was married .
right . gay husband .
she &apos;ll have what i &apos;m having .

and i just-- i just wanna make sure that the high school

thanks
may i help you ?
thank you for the text .
you &apos;re welcome .
i didn &apos;t tell her anything .
i--i kept my promise .
the girl though , she knows something
at won &apos;t be a problem .
she won &apos;t get any closer to the truth .
good .

yes . you &apos;re done .
no ! i won &apos;t invite you in .
you can &apos;t come in !
i &apos;m not a vampire , so , yes , i can .

everything he knows about vampires , he learned from her .
he believes that she was killed by one .
oh , my god .
listen , elena , there &apos;s a lot
there is a lot about isobel than alaric can tell you ,
i need you hold of
before you talk to him .

it was just kind of a ... a shock .
well , i &apos;m sorry for dropping it on you ,
but i felt like you should know .

at some point ,
maybe you and elena could talk .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;d like to hear about isobel ,
what she was like .
yeah .
or not . no pressure .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s a ... a great idea .
at least not ... not for a while .

not impressive .
in any way .
very exciting .
i &apos;ve got the big date planned .
it &apos;s a romantic dinner ,
secluded spot somewhere woodsy .
you &apos;re making me think i should buy a ticket
well , you are in charge . you could always rig it .
pardon me .
i ran the check on the history teacher .
you want this before or after your big debut ?
how &apos;s it look ?
he checks out .

isobel .
and what do you do , bachelor number 3 ?
yeah , i &apos;m a plumber .

what do you do , alaric ?
i &apos;m a teacher at mystic falls high .
oh , beauty and brains , ladies .

and last , but not least ,
damon salvatore .
we don &apos;t have much on you .
well , i &apos;m tough to fit on a card .
do you have any hobbies , like to travel ?
oh , yeah . l.a. , new york .
couple of years ago , i was in north carolina ,
near the duke campus , actually .
i think--i think alaric when to school there .
didn &apos;t you , rick ?
yeah , &apos; cause i-- i know your wife did .
i had a drink with her once ,
she was a great girl , never tell you that ?
cause she was--
she--
delicious .
are you ok ?
i just need some air .
elena
he killed her ,
damon was the vampire that killed her ?
i don &apos;t know what happened .
alaric said that they never found the body .
oh , my god . stefan .
i know . i &apos;m sorry . i wanted to tell you ,
but i just-- i wanted to know more .
i was feeling sorry for him ,
hoping that this whole katherine thing would change him .
i &apos;m so stupid .
he doesn &apos;t know about the connection to you .
i thought about confronting him .
but he is already so on edge .
why are you protecting him ?
because you are not the only one hoping that he might actually change .
that man .
i saw that man outside of trudie &apos;s .
get back inside . come on
and bachelor number 3 goes to 37458 .
that &apos;s me .
ah . kelly donovan . lovely .
you and the plumber should have so much fun .
congratulations , ms. donovan .
ok . just ... stop .
stop trying so hard .
this thing you &apos;re doing , this nice thing , it &apos;s fake ,
like you , like your mom ,
and for some reason , matt fell for it ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean that i will .
i don &apos;t like you , ok ?
so tell plumber boy i &apos;ll be at the bar .
whoa . easy there .
buy a ticket like everyone else .
did you enjoy that ,
rubbing it in to alaric saltzman ?
what ?
just as i was starting to think that there
was something redeemable about you .
elena .
am i missing something here ?
did i forget to mention earlier when we were talking
about my birth mother ,
the one that gave me up ?
her name was isobel .
go ahead . reminisce about how you killed her .
let &apos;s get you home .
i have a message for you .
what ?
who are you ?
stop looking .
stop looking for what ?
she doesn &apos;t want to know you .
she doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
isobel .
you need to stop looking . do you understand ?
she &apos;s alive ? does that mean she &apos;s a ...
elena , he &apos;s under a compulsion .
do you understand ?
yes . i do .
good .
i &apos;m done now .
come on . let &apos;s get out of here .
37649 .
that &apos;s me .
congratulations .
and bachelor number 5 , damon salvatore .
37552 .
what are the chances ? me .
where &apos;d he go ?
i &apos;m gonna call you later .
i think it &apos;s time to let this vampire crap go .
i mean , the research , the trips ,
it &apos;s become an obsession .
this is important to me .
why ? why is this so important ?
explain to me . i mean ... make me understand .
i mean , what &apos;s the point of this ?
you don &apos;t want kids . you &apos;re barely ever home .
i just want us to be normal people .
maybe i don &apos;t want to .
maybe i want more .
here we go . home , sweet home .
wait . why ... why are we back here ?
i wasn &apos;t ready to leave .
yeah , you were , mom .
you &apos;re the best , matty .
i know .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry ...
i was gone so long .
why are you really home , mom ?
it &apos;s pete .
he &apos;s gone ,
and it &apos;s all my fault .
i did it . i always do it .
no , you didn &apos;t , mom .
it &apos;s not your fault .
you &apos;re all i have left .
please don &apos;t leave from me
i &apos;m not goin &apos; anywhere .
are you really this stupid ?
guess so .
you gotta put down the stake .
wow . that &apos;s courage .
where &apos;s isobel ?
what have you done to my wife ?
you want me to tell you i killed her ?
would that make you happy ?
because i think you know what happened .
i saw you feeding on her .
yeah . i did , and i wasn &apos;t lying .
she was delicious .
oh , come on . what do you think happened ?
not an inkling ?
never considered the possibility ?
i turned her .
why ?
she came to me , all pathetic ,
looking for vampires .
there was something about her ,
something i liked .
there was something special .
i turned her because she begged me to .
yeah . but you knew that , too , didn &apos;t you ?
hmm . i guess she wasn &apos;t happy at home ,
wasn &apos;t happy with life in general ,
wasn &apos;t happy with you .
ah , this is a shame .
unrequited love sucks .
sounds like i got a lung .
we &apos;re kindred spirits , abandoned by the women we love .
what happened ?
what did you do ?
dude , what ? he attacked me .
damon .
all i did was tell him the truth .
his wife didn &apos;t want him anymore .
it &apos;s not my fault he couldn &apos;t handle it .
like you &apos;ve been handling katherine ?
i &apos;m handling it fine . you know what ?
isobel came to me .
she found me .
and if she &apos;s related to elena ,
that means she &apos;s related to katherine .
maybe katherine sent her to me .
stop it . you don &apos;t have to keep looking .
can &apos;t be a coincidence isobel sought me out .
mm @-@ mmm . can &apos;t .
i &apos;m assuming you &apos;ll take care of this .
what happened ?
what &apos;s going on ?
you were just ...
did damon turn you ?
no . i--i went for him ,
and then he , uh-- he stabbed me .
no , no , no .
you must have vampire blood in your system .
somebody slipped it to you .
then how ?
i , uh ...
isobel .
surprise gifts aren &apos;t fair .
i always feel bad for not getting you something .
just open it .
oh , that &apos;s a giant piece of jewelry .
just tell people it &apos;s a family heirloom .
nobody questions that .
where &apos;d you get this ?
if i told you , you &apos;d laugh at me .
but promise me that you &apos;ll always wear it .
it &apos;ll protect you from all the things that go bump in the night .
a ring to ward off the demons , eh ?
consider it a-- a token of my love ,
my affection , and if nothing else ,
an apology for being so crazy .
well , you were definitely crazy .
i &apos;m selfish , and i &apos;m obsessed ,
and i &apos;m a horrible wife .
but you love me anyway .
yes , i do .
this ring protected me .
that &apos;s impossible .
i know .
was there a problem ?
did you find her ?
what &apos;s going on ?
isobel ?
thanks .
it &apos;s harper .
i &apos;m glad you found us .
ms. gibbons ,
this gentleman is a friend of mine .
may he come in ?
any friend of pearl &apos;s is a friend of mine .
please do . come in .
