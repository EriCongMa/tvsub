seems like forever
since the four of us have been out to eat you know ?
just the guys .
oh god ! yes we get it .
you have a girlfriend now .
a little jealous sorry ?
no i &apos;m not jealous .
all right i &apos;d kill a hobo if it &apos;ll get me laid .
now can we order ?
oh dear lord they re @-@ did the menu .
so what ? it &apos;s the same food .
oh is it ? look at this .
general tso &apos;s chicken
is no longer listed under &quot; specialties . &quot;
it &apos;s now under &quot; chicken . &quot;
so ?
yes general tso .
not &quot; tso &quot; the chicken &quot; so &quot; the question .
so ?
so why is it no longer a specialty ?
did the chef lose confidence
in the dish or himself ?
and look over here .
&quot; shrimp in mobster sauce . &quot;
what is &quot; mobster sauce &quot; ?
it &apos;s obviously a typo .
perhaps . or perhaps this restaurant &apos;s
now a front for organized crime .
for all we know the mobster sauce
contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters .
no no no no-- i think it just means
it &apos;s the kind of sauce that mobsters like .
it doesn &apos;t mean any of that !
it &apos;s a typo .
you know what ? let &apos;s just get a pizza .
good idea . we &apos;ll go to corleone &apos;s .
sure no mobsters there .
you know the more i think about it
the mobster sauce couldn &apos;t possibly contain
chunks of mobster .
and why is that ?
it was listed under &quot; seafood . &quot;
what if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes ?
leonard are we having a serious conversation or not ?
what the ... ?
the tv is gone .
so are our laptops .
oh god .
oh god .
oh god !
it &apos;s all right .
they didn &apos;t take my comic books .
they took our tv
two laptops
four external hard @-@ drives
our ps2 our ps3
our x @-@ box our x @-@ box 360
our classic nintendo
our super nintendo our nintendo 64 and our wii .
we like games .
right games . they took halo 1
halo 2 halo 3 call of duty 1
call of duty 2 call of duty 3
rock band rock band 2
final fantasy 1 thru 9 the legend of zelda
the legend of zelda : ocarina of time
the legend of zelda : twilight princess
super mario brothers super mario galaxy
mario and sonic at the winter olympics ...
... and ms . pacman .
assorted video games .
when does the csi team get here ?
what ?
in anticipation of their arrival
i &apos;ve bagged some evidence .
one of the thieves had the audacity
to quench his thirst while ransacking our home .
you should be able to pull some good prints off this .
and now here are my prints
so you can rule me out as a suspect .
what about me ?
i &apos;m sorry leonard . it &apos;s too early to discount
the possibility of this being an inside job .
would i be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him ?
i &apos;d be happy to put him under a 72 @-@ hour
psychiatric hold .
i &apos;m not crazy .
my mother had me tested .
we &apos;re done here .
call this number and we &apos;ll fax you a copy of the report
so you can submit it to your insurance company .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s the end of your inquiry ?
do you have any more information that might be relevant ?
oh my goodness . where do i begin ? for instance--
my laptop contained
four out of the five gedankenexperiments
necessary for a cogent restatement
of the quantum measurement problem .
how is that going to help them ?
they could monitor scientific publications and see
if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next
couple of months . if so
the authors are most likely
in possession of my stolen laptop .
good night fellas .
come on bochco .
what are we supposed to do now ?
the only thing we can do .
watch tv on our phones until the criminals return
and bludgeon us to death in our sleep .
does that mean you &apos;ve ruled me out as a suspect ?
oh how i wish i could .
i do not have to urinate .
i am the master of my own bladder .
drat .
i can &apos;t believe it .
if i hadn &apos;t been working the dinner shift
i would &apos;ve run right into the robbers .
hey there &apos;s no reason for you to be scared .
i &apos;m not scared .
i would &apos;ve gone all nebraska on their asses .
leonard and penny .
leonard and penny .
leonard and penny .
hand me the bat .
we just had a major crime in the building
and you open the door without asking who it is ?
it won &apos;t happen again . what &apos;s up ?
nothing .
i just wanted to see if you were both okay .
we &apos;re fine sheldon .
all right then .
good night .
good night .
that was weird even for him .
leonard and penny .
leonard and penny .
leonard and penny .

sheldon . sheldon cooper .
yes ?
may i come in ?
yeah .
i see you &apos;re drinking wine .
yes we are .
and we &apos;re about to go to bed .
sheldon do you want to sleep here tonight ?
oh as small as leonard is
i don &apos;t think the two of you &apos;d be comfortable on the couch .
what do you want ?
it &apos;s not what i want it &apos;s what evolution wants .
human beings are primates .
primates have evolved to live in groups
both for protection and support .
but you don &apos;t like other people .
i do tonight .
it &apos;s scary over there .
it &apos;s getting scary here too .
three little kittens ?
three little pigs ?
god i don &apos;t know .
star wars ?
did we win ? can we go to bed ?
good lord-- i could not have made this easier .
hydrogen atom h
plus pigs minus pea-- higgs .
bow general zod trapped in the phantom zone .

higgs boson particle .
how could you not get that ?
he &apos;s right penny . it &apos;s all there .
sheldon sweetie i know you &apos;re feeling insecure
but we &apos;ve really got to go to sleep .
all right . i &apos;ll take the first watch
and wake you at 0400 .
great . good night .
wait wait-- what &apos;s 0400 ?
4 : 00 a.m.
that &apos;s like in 45 minutes .
just keep walking .
it &apos;s quiet out there .
maybe a little too quiet .
where are you going ?
just gonna take a look around outside .
bad idea .
no jim don &apos;t open the door !
listen to her jim .
don &apos;t worry .
there &apos;s no one out there .
leonard and penny !
leonard and penny !
leonard and penny !
who is it ?
all right we &apos;ve got a titanium dead bolt
and a reinforced jamb
controlled by a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art electronic access system .
what if they cut the power ?
there &apos;s a 200 @-@ watt uninterruptible
backup power supply .
what if someone steals my keys ?
there are independent voice and fingerprint scanners .
what if someone kidnaps me forces me to record my voice
and then cuts off my thumb ?
i &apos;ll send them a basket of muffins .
now inside we &apos;ve got motion detectors
infrared sensors and cameras connected to a server
running state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art facial recognition software .
where did you get all this stuff ?
eh i got a buddy over at the department of defense .
he just gave it to you ?
i &apos;m sure he would have if i had asked .
ironically their security
isn &apos;t all that good .
raj your car is blocking me ...
intruder alert intruder alert .
intruder alert .
what the hell ?
intruder alert .
sorry let me help you .
wonderful security system
if we &apos;re attacked by a school of tuna .
don &apos;t worry the net &apos;s going to be electrified .
you picture her on the floor spasming uncontrollably .
better .
sheldon &apos;s journal .
security system in place .
however sleep continues to elude me .
i &apos;ve seen the underbelly of pasadena ...
this so @-@ called city of roses and it haunts me .
ah the injustice .
i lie here awake tormented
while out there evil lurks
probably playing donkey kong on my classic nintendo .
oh dear .
i am the master of my own bladder .
leonard and penny .
leonard and penny .
leonard and penny .
oh my ...
god sheldon .
what the hell are you doing out there ?
i heard a noise .
it was us .
we knocked over a lamp .
why would you knock over a lamp ?
we were going to have ...
he doesn &apos;t need
to know what we were doing leonard .
no she &apos;s right i don &apos;t need to know what you were doing .
carry on .
what are you doing ?
use the door .
good thinking .
perhaps i &apos;ll check the perimeter
and make some warm milk .
great you do that .
would you like me to bring you some warm milk ?
i &apos;m lactose intolerant .
and you don &apos;t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises .
very thoughtful .
warm milk penny ?
no thanks .
fine .
good night to you sir .
miss .
sorry about that .
ugh what can you do ?
here .
intruder alert intruder alert .
intruder alert intruder alert .
looks like wolowitz got the net electrified .
sheldon are you okay ?
i @-@ i &apos;m fine ...
although i &apos;m no longer the master of my own bladder .
my new computer came with windows 7 .
windows 7 is much more user @-@ friendly than windows vista .
i don &apos;t like that .
don &apos;t you think looking for a new city to live in
is a bit of an overreaction ?
our apartment was broken into
our security system tried to kill me
and as a result i &apos;m leaving pasadena forever .
tell me how that &apos;s overreacting .
come on sheldon you can &apos;t move .
don &apos;t you need to stay in one place
so the mother ship can find you
when it returns ?
oh if that were only true .
unfortunately as i &apos;m earthbound for the foreseeable future
i need to find a location that &apos;s more hospitable
than the mean streets of pasadena like ...
enid oklahoma .
low crime rate
and high @-@ speed internet connectivity ...
but no model train shops .
sorry enid .
is he quitting his job at the university ?
oh no he &apos;s going to telecommute .
everybody &apos;s really excited about it .
all right .
boone north carolina .
&quot; every summer since 1952
boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal
of the life and times of its namesake dan &apos;l boone . &quot;
sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd .
penny you &apos;re from nebraska correct ?
born and raised .
it will take me a few days to get settled .
after i do i will e @-@ mail you detailed pdfs
containing diagrams and instructions
that will guide you through packing and shipping
the rest of my possessions to bozeman montana .
in the meantime please forward my mail .
any place specific
or just the bozeman montana loony bin ?
i sense you &apos;re making a joke
but bozeman does have a comedy club called the loony bin
so do not forward my mail there .
oh come on .
so you were the victim of a crime .
that &apos;s part of life .
when my great @-@ grandfather first came to this country
he put all his hopes and dreams
into this little butcher shop he ran
on the lower east side of new york .
you know what happened ?
every customer who walked into that butcher shop
and asked for a pound of liver
got ripped off .
but ...
those people moved on and so should you .
i am moving on .
i &apos;m going to be a bozite .
they call themselves &quot; bozites &quot; ?
they should . it &apos;s one of the first things
i plan to bring up upon arrival .
sheldon i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this
but i &apos;m going to miss you .
penny as you know i &apos;m not comfortable
with prolonged good @-@ byes and maudlin displays of emotion
so i prepared a short video .
greetings .
as you know i &apos;m not comfortable with prolonged good @-@ byes
and maudlin displays of emotion
so i prepared this short video .
the four of you are three of my closest friends
and one treasured acquaintance .
though i cannot state categorically that my life
will be diminished by not having you in it
i am comfortable if you choose to believe that .
since you intend to remain
in this lawless metropolitan area
statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic
and gruesome ends before we meet again .
live long and prosper .
sheldon that &apos;s so ...
you might want to lock the door behind me .
this isn &apos;t bozeman .
how the hell do i know who &apos;s the friend
and who &apos;s the acquaintance ?
that is a bracing cold
an invigorating cold .
lord is it cold !
help you with your bags sir ?
thank you fellow bozite .
and may i say you are the living embodiment of all
the promises made by our lovely town &apos;s chamber of commerce .
wait !
wait !
excuse me !
one ticket to pasadena california please .
hey look who &apos;s back !
interesting .
