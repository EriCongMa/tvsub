第三季 第五集
just can &apos;t stop looking at this thing .

you know , something about the cord
and the handset that just really set me at ease .
you were weirdly smooth .
if you slow dance with nick ,
i &apos;ll hold hands with amy .
just make sure she cut her fingernails , though .
tell her i &apos;ll make her a mix tape .
i &apos;m just being stupid .
tell her i &apos;ll make her a mix tape .
it was going great , by the way .
if this isn &apos;t sexy ,
i don &apos;t know what the heck is .
something just came over him .
he was amazing .
i &apos;m just excited to add a third number :
home , work and cell .
damn , i &apos;m reachable .
i &apos;m definitely gonna mention that
in my profile in business , man ! magazine .
businessman magazine ?
no , no , no . check that out : business , man ! magazine .
i &apos;ve gotten a lot of heat
from working on the sponge account .
i &apos;m telling you , this is the first step in my quest
to becoming a millionaire .
well , i think that &apos;s a weird plan ,
but let &apos;s drink to it , who &apos;s in ?
no , come on , i got to study for my interview .
oh , i would , man , but i got a lot of police stuff to study .
you know , like , roads , laws , bullets ...
be really nice if you guys spent some time
and studied your friend nick .
pop quiz , hotshots .
i miss you guys .
i don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying , man .

we have to fill out a form declaring our relationship ?
yes , it &apos;s a legal thing .
we &apos;re just covering our asses .
while you uncover yours .
sorry , that was an unfortunate joke .
um , anyway , uh , how did this start ?
uh , fine . a couple of weeks ago i got a cut .
and i went to the nurse .
okay .
and when i saw her , i was like , &quot; damn . &quot;
and i was , like , &quot; you frickin &apos; got a cut . &quot;
and i was like , &quot; you frickin &apos; better fix it . &quot;
and she was like , &quot; no . cuts are gross . &quot;
yeah .
and then we had sex .
yeah .
that &apos;s disturbing
on so many levels .
um , i &apos;m sorry , but your outfit
looks like you got it at a halloween store .
thank you . coach got it for me .
it &apos;s a child &apos;s medium .
what &apos;d you put for &quot; nature of relationship &quot; -- &quot; girlfriend &quot; ?
well , that &apos;s what i actually wanted to talk to you about .
&apos;cause , uh , we hadn &apos;t ...
question mark ?
um , it didn &apos;t feel like a question mark
when you put a calamari on my finger like an engagement ring .
that didn &apos;t seem like a question mark to you ?
it &apos;s squid .
jess , someone &apos;s in my parking spot again .
not now , rose .
hey , ernie .

i just wanted a quote . yeah , i get a quote
just in case i do want to actually buy one .
and it &apos;s nice to have a price
before you get emotionally invested .
it &apos;s called predicting desires .
what i wish i would have said is when i first said it--
&quot; spoiler alert . &quot;
i wish it ... when i ... i wish i would have said , um ,
&quot; you &apos;re getting a spoiler-- spoiler alert . &quot;

wow . that was intrusive .
winston , how do you not know if you &apos;d made love to someone ?
i &apos;m mad at you , jess .
why &apos;d you put me on blast like that ?
because you shouldn &apos;t be sleeping with other teachers , coach ,

who are you , blanche from golden girls ?
honestly , it took me a while to figure out
who i was in that school , but i finally did .
who ?
i &apos;m the guy who has sex with everyone .

we &apos;re here to address the school policies
on interfaculty relations .
some forms of touching , say ,
a ... a friendly handshake ,
or a spirited pat , are completely appropriate .
what if you spill coffee
on your pants , and you &apos;re very burnt ,
and upon getting your pants cut off by paramedics ,
you become aroused ?
i &apos;m truly hoping that didn &apos;t happen .
what if you &apos;re in a situation where you either have to
grab a teacher &apos;s crotch ,
or give narcotics to a student ?
that &apos;s a great question , man .
thanks , friend .
not a great question .
and what if you ... ?
i &apos;m done with you . if you feel things getting sexual ...
just say , &quot; shut it down ! &quot;
followed by a sweeping gesture with your hands , like such .
everyone do it with me . shut it down !
no , thanks .
it &apos;s kind of fun . shut it down .
shut it ... down .
thank ... thank you , new guy .
yes , coach .
see , i &apos;m more of a visual learner .
oh , yeah , you are .
do you think you could
maybe demonstrate that move in context ?

i think we &apos;d all like that . it &apos;s kind of like a ...
like a skit .

no idea .
visual learning .
like a skit .
visual learning .

are you out of your mind ? i &apos;m on fire right now .
this is a home . we &apos;re not selling lubricant .
why aren &apos;t one of you doing this ?
because we couldn &apos;t decide which of us
to do it , and this way , it &apos;s fair .
put nothing on it . flat as can be .
all right , here we go . flat as can be .
just say the words .
hello . you &apos;ve reached the loft .
oh , my god !
will you not stop until the whole world is aroused ? !
okay .

i know what you &apos;re doing .
you &apos;re blowing hot air up in between my butt cheeks .
and i &apos;m no idiot . i know i was let go &apos; cause of
the dang old machine . story as old as time .
a new piece of technology comes around ,
and all the peasants freak out .
but one prince knows what &apos;s going on ,
and he says , &quot; don &apos;t trust the technology ! &quot;
and all you peasants trust it ,
and then the machine becomes self @-@ aware
and destroys you all .
and then , i become the loneliest prince of all ,
laughing in my golden tower .
isn &apos;t that a movie ?
maybe i stole that from war games , yeah .
short circuit .
no , it isn &apos;t .
man , you know what &apos;s a good movie ? splash .
i don &apos;t know what is happening .

and i feel mr. g. &apos; s hands on my shoulders .
i &apos;m not interested .
so what do i do ?
i say , &quot; shut it down . &quot;

i feel like it needs to be a little more real ,
you know what i mean ?
i feel like if he were to touch her , that would help , am i right ?

it &apos;ll be more helpful
if he were to touch her . just touch her , man .

why are you so obsessed with answering the phone ?
man .
we &apos;re just peeling the onion

uh @-@ huh . schmidt ,
some can have money ,
i desire thoughtfulness .
schmidt don &apos;t quit !
hey , coach .
i just came in here to say i &apos;m sorry .
sometimes it &apos;s ...
hard to control your feelings .
which i demonstrated by ...
grabbing a man &apos;s &quot; dujeels &quot; in front of the entire faculty .
well , i &apos;m sorry for putting you in a position
to grab that man &apos;s &quot; dujeels . &quot;
i don &apos;t like saying &quot; dujeels . &quot; it &apos;s weird .
i call mine my sam jackson &apos; cause he &apos;s in everything .
i just don &apos;t know how to face ryan again .
i was so unprofessional .
jess , you &apos;re the vice principal ,
and you &apos;re a great vice principal .
doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re not a human being .
thanks .
oh ... and you &apos;ll be happy to know
i &apos;ve repealed the policy .

my bad .
hi . sorry . um , my hands are ...
staying behind my back , don &apos;t worry .
i won &apos;t even look at it .

i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t be sorry .
um , my boss .

i &apos;ll , uh , see you around .
i hope so .
principal foster ,
i am so sorry . i went overboard .
first off , it &apos;s &quot; dog . &quot;
dog .
secondly , do not apologize .
i have tried to corral these animals myself .
it &apos;s impossible .
word .
these teachers are straight @-@ up ho &apos;s , dog .
sometimes you just got to let people follow their urges .
yes .
i completely agree .
it &apos;s too bad we can &apos;t .
we can &apos;t ?
absolutely not . we &apos;re administrators , b.
this is a lawsuit waiting to happen .
two administrators ? perfectly fine .
but , unfortunately , as i &apos;ve repeatedly told you ,
i &apos;m not attracted to you .
right . you like asians .
so ... exactly .
so that &apos;s off the table .
yeah .
so , do us both a favor ...
lock up that lobster .
i still can &apos;t believe it .
look at that . &quot; bringing nasty back . &quot;
&quot; the bad boy of marketing . &quot;
that is cool . so great for my brand .
i mean , i always knew i was a bad boy ,
but now it &apos;s in print
and it &apos;s official .
don &apos;t call yourself a bad boy .
am i a bad boy ?
you &apos;re not a bad boy .
