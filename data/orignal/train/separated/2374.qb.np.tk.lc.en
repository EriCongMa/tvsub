you must be elena .
how do we look exactly alike ?
i killed the doppelganger .
i broke the curse .
so what am i doing wrong ?
you &apos;d have to contact the witch who created it .
that would be the original witch .
the necklace is a talisman from the original witch herself .
hi , katherine .
feel like hitting the road ?
why not ?
rebekah . time to wake up , little sister .
when i met you two , there was a man looking for you .
you both seemed afraid . who was that man ?
what &apos;s going on ?
he was asking about michael .
he &apos;s not with us , nik , i can sense it .
you &apos;re holding on to something .
i thought i would see for myself
what it is you &apos;ve been hiding .
welcome back to mystic falls , stefan .
oh , come on ! seriously ? !
do you know how long it took for us to set all this up ? !
forgot about senior prank night , huh ?
clearly .
how could you forget ?
we &apos;ve only been waiting for this since like freshman year .
yeah , matt . if i &apos;m doing this , you &apos;re doing this .
i &apos;m kind of surprised any of you are doing this .
caroline &apos;s making us .
we &apos;re about to be seniors .
these are the memories that stay with us forever ,
and if we don &apos;t--
and if we don &apos;t create these memories now ,
then what &apos;s the point of it all ?
go ahead and make fun , i don &apos;t care .
you &apos;re all lame . and i &apos;ve got ten more classrooms to prank .
hey ! where are you going ?
to superglue alaric &apos;s desk shut .
i &apos;m making memories .
i love you !
get the faculty toilet seats ,
and dana needs bodies in the gym . let &apos;s go .
there &apos;s my girl .
klaus !
you &apos;re supposed to be dead .
what are we going to do about that ?
are you hungry ? let &apos;s stop for a bite .
a truck stop . or a trucker .
oh , stop being cute .
it &apos;s not possible .
we &apos;ve been driving around aimlessly for hours .
where are we going ?
far enough away so that you can &apos;t go running back .
not to worry . mystic falls and i are on a bit of a break .
you and mystic falls , or you and elena ?
let &apos;s just say elena and i are having
a bit of difference of opinion on how i should behave .
ooh . let me guess-- elena wants you to be the hero ,
and you don &apos;t like playing pretend .
something like that .
her loss .
what are you doing ?
i thought i &apos;d give it a shot .
truth is , you just don &apos;t do it for me anymore .
oh , he lives .
what happened ?
you took a beating .
my brother &apos;s been breaking your neck all afternoon .
quite the temper .
why did he bring us back to mystic falls ?
you can stop playing dumb now .
it didn &apos;t take him long to figure out what you &apos;d been hiding .
i &apos;m not hiding anything .
i &apos;ve done everything klaus has asked me to .
no , you just failed to mention
that the doppelganger &apos;s still alive .
where is klaus now ?
with any luck , ripping that cow &apos;s bloody head off .
where is she ?
you really do love her , don &apos;t you ?
consider me jealous .
you put a rather large kink in my plans , sweetheart .
the whole point of breaking the curse and becoming a hybrid
was to make more hybrids .
i haven &apos;t been able to do that . now my bet is ,
it has something to do with the fact that you &apos;re still breathing .
if you &apos;re going to kill me , just do it !
not until i know i &apos;m right .
but i do have ways of making you suffer .
attention , seniors .
you have officially been busted . prank night is over .
head on home .
you two . i remember you .
i &apos;m sorry . who are you ?
oh , don &apos;t worry , i wasn &apos;t in my right head last time we met .
lift your foot up , please , dana .
if she drops her foot , chad , i want you to beat her to death .
understood ?
don &apos;t , klaus . you don &apos;t have to hurt anybody .
oh , come on , love . of course i do .
why are we stopping ?
i thought we might want to stretch our legs .
take a break from the sexual tension .
i &apos;m tired of driving .
it &apos;s your turn .
fine .
we &apos;re not going anywhere until you spill your guts .
fine .
do you recognize this , hmm ?
a little birdy told me that klaus wants to get his hands on it .
why would klaus want elena &apos;s necklace ?
does it matter ? he wants it , and i have it .
it &apos;s leverage , damon .
always stay one step ahead of your enemy .
i &apos;ll keep that in mind .
but more importantly ,
when i stole the necklace from bonnie ,
i found out something else-- something better .
oh , yeah ? what &apos;s that ?
are you willing to do whatever it takes to stop klaus ?
no turning back ?
i &apos;m not turning back .
good . &apos; cause this isn &apos;t going to win you any points at home .
jeremy ? really ?
do you think matt &apos;s going to be ok ?
i &apos;m kissing you and you &apos;re wondering about your ex @-@ boyfriend ?
i &apos;m asking you if you think our friend ,
who we both love , is ok .
i think he probably doesn &apos;t have
a lot of people to talk to anymore .
i think he &apos;s struggling more than he lets on .
i think that i love how big your heart is .
i just want this school year to be great , you know ?
i just want everyone to be happy .
even in the midst of all the crazy unhappy bits .
i &apos;m happy .
you two are adorable .
uh , do we know you ?
you &apos;re caroline , elena &apos;s friend , which makes you tyler .
the werewolf .
and who are you ?
i &apos;m the new girl .
caroline !
this is fun , right ?
you sound like caroline .
come on , i am embracing her philosophy .
you should be more into this .
i know . where &apos;s jeremy tonight ?
i haven &apos;t talked to him all day .
we &apos;re having , um ...
he , uh , he told me about seeing vicki .
ohh . good , i &apos;m glad that you know .
i &apos;m sorry . is it weird talking about your sister like this ?
no , i--i just kind of want to see her myself , you know ?
i mean , i never got to say good @-@ bye to her .
do you realize that just last summer ,
you and i were lifeguards at the pool ?
and the only two problems i had in my life
were that elena was breaking up with me and i sucked at cpr .
everything was so different then .
yeah . now elena &apos;s dating a vampire , you &apos;re a witch ,
my sister &apos;s a ghost , and ...
i &apos;m--i &apos;m just a guy who &apos;s wondering how life got so screwed up .
it &apos;s crazy , matt . i--
i can &apos;t imagine what it must be like for you .
it just , uh , kind of explains
why i &apos;m not that into senior prank night .
yeah .
i &apos;ll go grab a couple more rolls .
then we hit the gym .
i &apos;m here , matt .
i can help you .
keep it up .
where &apos;s stefan ? what did you do to him ?
stefan &apos;s on a time out .
bonnie , get out of here !
ah , i was wondering when you &apos;d show up .
now we can get started .
ah , dana , why don &apos;t you relax ?
you and chad sit tight .
i assume you &apos;re the reason elena &apos;s still walking around alive ?
that &apos;s right . if you want to blame someone , blame me .
oh , there &apos;s no need for blame , love .
just your witchy interference
seems to have caused some undesirable side effects .
and since you caused the problem ,
i &apos;m going to have you find the fix .
get off of me !
hush now .
i &apos;d like you all to meet my sister rebekah .
word of warning-- she can be quite mean .
don &apos;t be an ass .
leave him alone !
i &apos;m going to make this very simple--
every time i attempt to turn a werewolf into a vampire hybrid ,
they die during the transition .
it &apos;s quite horrible , actually .
i need you to find a way to save my hybrids , bonnie .
and for tyler &apos;s sake ...
you better hurry .
he killed him .
he &apos;s not dead . klaus &apos;s blood will turn him into a vampire .
and if bonnie &apos;s successful ,
he &apos;ll live through his transition .
go on , then . go and fetch your grimoires
and enchantments and what @-@ not .
i &apos;ll hold on to elena. for safe @-@ keeping .
so this is the latest doppelganger .
the original one was much prettier .
enough , rebekah .
take the wolf boy elsewhere , would you ?
just ignore her .
petty little thing .
what are you going to do ?
i have no idea . the curse he &apos;s talking about
is a thousand years old . my grimoires don &apos;t go back that far .
can you ask those dead witches that helped you before ?
i don &apos;t have contact with them anymore--
they cut me off when i brought jeremy back to life .
that &apos;s it !
i can &apos;t contact the dead .
jeremy can .
i &apos;m listening .
what if i told you there was a way to kill klaus ?
and not dagger dead . dead dead .
i &apos;d say you were desperate and lying .
or drunk .
or desperate , lying and drunk .
do you remember my friend pearl ?
vividly .
centuries ago ,
she told me about a vampire who knew how to kill klaus .
then she wouldn &apos;t tell me any more .
well , why not ?
because it was her leverage .
she knew it was valuable information ,
and wouldn &apos;t share it with me .
well , this is all great ...
but she &apos;s dead .
which is why i never brought it up .
because she only ever told one other person .
who ?
her daughter .
anna .
also dead .
which brings us right back around to ...
me
back around to me .
stefan ...
klaus .
come to save your damsel , mate ?
i came to ask for your forgiveness .
and pledge my loyalty .
well , you broke that pledge once already .
elena means nothing to me anymore .
and whatever you ask of me ...
i will do .
fair enough .
let &apos;s drink on it .
kill them .
what are you waiting for ? kill them .
no ! stefan , don &apos;t .
he &apos;s not going to hurt me . he already said--ahh !
she means nothing to you ?
your lies just keep piling up .
let her go ! i &apos;ll do whatever you want , you have my word !
your word doesn &apos;t mean much .
i lived by your word all summer ,
during which time i never had to resort to this--
stop fighting .
don &apos;t do this , don &apos;t do this .
i didn &apos;t want to . all i wanted was your allegiance .
now i &apos;m going to have to take it .
don &apos;t ... don &apos;t ...
you will do exactly as i say
when i say it .
you will not run , you will not hide ,
you will simply just obey .
no !
stefan !
now kill them . ripper .
this isn &apos;t going to work .
i think that your witchy girlfriend &apos;s worried
that you &apos;ve run away with your ghostly lover .
stop with the teeny bopper drama .
focus .
i &apos;m not helping them .
no , it &apos;s ok to help .
they &apos;re looking for a way to stop klaus .
i don &apos;t care . katherine is not a friend to you .
neither of them are .
what &apos;s she saying ?
well , she doesn &apos;t want to help you .
my advice ? hmm ?
if you want to make an omelet , you have to break a few eggs .
jeremy , i just want you to know , it &apos;s nothing personal .
ow ! what the hell ? !
jeremy !
anna , i know you can hear me .
tell us what you know .
the sooner , the better for your little boyfriend here .
they &apos;re looking for michael .
michael !
michael . is that his name ?
who &apos;s michael ?
the vampire who hunts vampires .
you don &apos;t want to wake him . he will kill all of you .
what &apos;s she saying ?
hello !
he &apos;s a vampire and a hunter ,
and you guys would be idiots to wake him .
what do you mean , wake him ?
it &apos;s time to go find the keys .
we didn &apos;t have mobile telephones in my day .
would have made life a whole lot easier , i suppose .
where &apos;s tyler ?
he &apos;s dead .
ish .
what did you do to him ?
think of it as he &apos;s having a nap .
when he wakes up , he &apos;ll be a hybrid .
ugh . vomit .
is that my neck--
why is that doppelganger bitch wearing my necklace ? !
it &apos;s always nice to see a vampire in his true element .
the species has become such a broody lot .
no . you did this to him .
i invited him to the party , love .
he &apos;s the one dancing on the table .
where is it ? !
where &apos;s my necklace ?
what are you talking about ?
she has my necklace .
look .
well , well . more lies .
where ... is it ?
i don &apos;t have it anymore .
you &apos;re lying !
knock it off !
make her tell me where it is , nik !
where &apos;s the necklace , sweetheart ? be honest .
i &apos;m telling the truth .
katherine stole it .
katerina .
of course .
well , that &apos;s unfortunate .
if we had the necklace it would make things
a whole lot easier for your witch ,
but since we &apos;re doing this the hard way ,
let &apos;s put a clock on it , shall we ?
20 minutes .
if bonnie hasn &apos;t found a solution by then ,
i want you to feed again . only this time ,
i want you to feed on elena .
you know you want to .
no , klaus ! don &apos;t do this to him !
no one leaves . if she tries to run , fracture her spine .
did you find jeremy ?
no ! i called him like 20 times .
all right , i &apos;ll grab my keys , we &apos;ll head to his house .
ok . i &apos;ll meet you by your truck .
what the hell ?
oh , you &apos;ve got to be kidding me !
matt !
i can help you , mattie , but i need you to hear me .
vicki ?
what is taking so long ?
this is going to sound crazy ,
but i think vicki &apos;s trying to reach out to me .
what ?
i think she can help us save tyler .
no , jeremy can help us save tyler .
we can &apos;t find jeremy . we need to try something else .
i have an idea but i &apos;m going to need your help .
meet me at the pool .
i don &apos;t understand .
jeremy can see ghosts because you brought him back from the dead .
i need you to do that for me .
what ? !
no , matt , that &apos;s crazy !
this is going to work , trust me .
no , matt ,
i can &apos;t do that kind of magic anymore .
you don &apos;t need magic , bonnie .
you just have to be better than i was at cpr .
don &apos;t fall asleep , jer . you might have a concussion .
thanks for the concern , dick .
oh , stop pouting . he took one for the team .
everyone back home will thank you once klaus is dead .
where &apos;s my phone ?
do you need to check in with elena ?
make sure it &apos;s ok you pummeled her little baby bro ?
you know you have it .
what can i say ?
i need you present here now .
katherine , phone , now .
bonnie &apos;s been texting me .
what is it ?
it &apos;s klaus .
no turning back , damon .
shut up , katherine .
hey , look at the big picture .
the best shot at taking out klaus is by finding michael .
stay with her so anna can guide you . i &apos;ll be back .
you &apos;re going to get yourself killed .
the damon i remember wouldn &apos;t have been that stupid .
i wouldn &apos;t have done it for you .
matt , please ! i can &apos;t do this .
there &apos;s nothing else i can do !
matt . matt .
vicki ?
matt .
please !
i can see you .
i need you to listen to me very carefully .
i don &apos;t have much time .
why , what &apos;s happening ? where are we ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . i need you to give bonnie a message .
it &apos;s ok .
you &apos;re ok .
caroline &apos;s dad !
stefan , he was able to resist compulsion .
i don &apos;t know how , but he did it .
maybe it &apos;s possible .
yeah , yeah . maybe it &apos;s just mind control , right ?
maybe it just takes some focus , a couple decades of training .
no big deal .
stefan , you can control this .
when that buzzer goes off ,
just--just drink from me .
you don &apos;t get it . i can &apos;t stop , elena !
i &apos;m a ripper ! a ripper doesn &apos;t stop !
i listen to the words that come out of your mouth ,
and all i hear is the sound of your heart
pumping blood through your body .
and when that clock ticks down ...
i &apos;m going to have to feed on you .
and you want to know what &apos;s worse ?
i &apos;m not going to be able to stop .
i don &apos;t believe that . you can fight it .
you just have to want it bad enough .
why , because i love you ?
yeah !
that &apos;s right , stefan . because you love me .
you &apos;ll fight because after everything that we &apos;ve been through ,
you owe me that !
you know what , you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re right . i owe you everything .
because through all of this , you are the one thing
that has kept me from giving up ;
from turning it all off .
but i can &apos;t help what i am , elena .
the more blood that i get , the more i want ,
and if i get so much as near yours ...
you are dead .
where am i ? what happened ?
tyler
don &apos;t be shy about it .
what &apos;s going on ?
klaus is turning you into a vampire .
a hybrid .
you &apos;re in transition .
don &apos;t leave out the hard part , sweets .
you &apos;ll only survive if your witch is successful .
if not ...
you &apos;re pretty much dead .
you &apos;re going to be ok .
ok ? it &apos;s gonna be ok .
i wonder how she &apos;s doing .
tick tock goes the gym clock .
as soon as you &apos;re feeling better ,
i &apos;m going to kill you .
it worked . i saw her , i saw vicki .
you did ?
she said she had a message for you .
for me ?
from the witch that put
the hybrid curse on klaus .
she said that elena shouldn &apos;t have survived klaus &apos; ritual .
the hybrids can &apos;t transition because elena &apos;s still alive .
tyler ...
he &apos;s going to die , isn &apos;t he ?
i wouldn &apos;t be too sure about that .
given the choice , doppelganger or a hybrid ,
i go hybrid every time .
elena , you &apos;re going to have run .
but klaus said that if i run--
i know what he said , but if you stay , it won &apos;t matter .
elena , please , please , please .
elena ...
there &apos;s no other way .
there is another way , stefan . it &apos;s for you to fight .
stefan ... i love you .
fight , stefan . don &apos;t give up .
i can &apos;t hold it .
elena , run ! go !
we &apos;ve got to stop meeting like this .
now this is fascinating . i &apos;ve never seen this before .
the only thing stronger than your craving for blood
is your love for this one girl .
why don &apos;t you turn it off ?
no !
come on .
your humanity is killing you .
all the guilt must be exhausting .
turn it off .
no !
stefan ...
you &apos;re strong .
but you &apos;re not that strong .
turn ... it ...
off .
no !
turn it off !
what did you do ?
i fixed him .
but i think a test is in order , don &apos;t you ?
ripper ...
perhaps you &apos;d like a drink ...
from the doppelganger &apos;s neck .
well , the verdict &apos;s in . the original witch
says the doppelganger should be dead .
does that mean we can kill her ?
no , i &apos;m fairly certain it means the opposite .
what ? !
call it a hunch--
elena &apos;s blood . drink it .
no ! no , no , no , tyler , don &apos;t !
if he doesn &apos;t feed , he &apos;ll die anyway , love .
consider this an experiment .
it &apos;s ok .
there you go .
come on .
good boy .
tyler ? no !
well , that &apos;s a good sign .
where am i ?
in the hospital , sweetie .
you suffered through a terrible ordeal .
i have to get out of here .
ah . not an option . you &apos;ve lost a lot of blood .
wait ...
you &apos;re taking my blood ?
of course . it &apos;s very important for your friend klaus .
no .
don &apos;t fight it , sweetie .
he told me you need plenty of rest .
so the doppelganger isn &apos;t the problem .
her blood is the solution .
seems so .
how did you know ?
well , you know how much the original witch hated me .
do you honestly think i would do anything other
than the opposite of what she says .
a thousand years in the grave
and she &apos;s still screwing with you .
well , it makes sense if you think about it from her perspective .
it was her failsafe in case i ever broke the hybrid curse .
the doppelganger had to die
in order for me to become a hybrid , but if she was dead ...
then you couldn &apos;t use her blood to sire yourself a new species .
leaving me alone for all time .
is that what this is about ?
your obsession with hybrids .
you just don &apos;t want to be alone ?
what i want
is to take my girl , take my hybrid
the hell out of this one pony town .
you know , why don &apos;t you , uh ,
why don &apos;t you get the truck ? i &apos;ll get elena .
well , look who finally decided to show up to the party .
where is she ?
elena ?
ah , she &apos;s making a donation to a greater cause .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t let you interfere , mate .
you &apos;ll have to kill me .
oh , i would love to kill you ,
but i made a pledge to your brother ,
and unlike him , i keep my word .
although , you know what , thinking about it now ,
he probably doesn &apos;t care that much anymore .
you don &apos;t want to know about your friend michael ?
what do you know about michael ?
just that he knows you &apos;re here .
bluffing .
katherine and i found him .
consider it our leverage .
damon ...
are you sure you &apos;re ok ?
i &apos;m great , caroline .
i mean , like , phenomenal .
it &apos;s a rush . i wish i could explain it .
everything &apos;s just ...
better .
this is going to be an amazing year .
you ready ? i could still use a ride over to jeremy &apos;s .
yeah , just a second .
listen to me .
i know you want to help , and i know you miss your sister .
but what you did was reckless and stupid .
i know . bonnie .
i know .
but it worked . it was worth it .
you don &apos;t want to be a part of all this , matt .
you are the only one of us who actually
gets to live your life like a normal person .
no matter how lost you feel ,
don &apos;t forget that .
i get it , bonnie .
i &apos;ll be out in a minute , all right ?
vicki &apos;s here .
watching me ,
and i just , uh ,
i just need a minute to say good @-@ bye , ok ?
bon , seriously ,
i &apos;m not going to do anything stupid , i just--
vickie ?
hi , mattie .
hey , have some bourbon .
it &apos;ll help you forget .
yeah , it &apos;s strong .
you know i can help you forget , too .
at least the memories you don &apos;t want to keep .
no . no compulsion .
i need to remember .
all of it .
i stole it back for you .
he &apos;s really gone this time .
i watched it happen .
after everything that we went through to get--to help him .
now he &apos;s just ...
gone .
where were you , damon ?
i shouldn &apos;t have left .
i promise you ...
i will never leave you again .
well , isn &apos;t this cozy ?
what are you doing here , brother ?
last i checked ,
i live here .
klaus is gone , but he &apos;s asked me
to keep watch on you until he returns .
from now on , you &apos;re under my protection .
mmm , by all means .
carry on .
how do you know that anna wasn &apos;t tricking you ?
this is the place .
it &apos;s the oldest wing of the largest cemetery in charlotte .
she said that a witch entombed them here in the nineties .
