Sorry about that, Mr....
McVeigh.
Oh, my goodness. What an unfortunate name.
Hopefully no relation?
Oh, um, I've offended you?
No. No. I'll talk to you soon.
I think I've just been visited by the Marlboro Man.
I played craps with that kid's life.
Will, you listen,
I know you did everything.
We're not gonna talk about this.
We're not gonna say any more.
We're gonna go to dinner in one week's time,
and we'll talk then.
Let's go to the bedroom.
No. Here.
So we can talk now, right?
I mean, the trial's over.We can talk now.
Yeah, we can talk.
We can swear. We can do whatever we want.
Okay, so, we'll do bathroom breaks first,
then, uh, get down to it.
So, uh, what do you think?
Guilty, right? She did it.
Actually, I think we should wait. For everybody.
Did you see her at the defense table?
Which her?
The one with the televangelist?
No, no, no. Um,
the one who sucked the toes.
Oh, come on. What was his name?
The prostitute.
You're talking about the defense attorney?
She's the wife, right?
Right. I thought I recognized her at the defense table.
Reasonable doubt.
What do we mean by reasonable doubt?
I thought the husband got out. Didn't he get out?
Boy, talk about using her.
Putting her at the defense table like that.
She's there 'cause she's a good lawyer.
Okay. Okay, okay.
Everybody ready?
Do we want to vote first?
Right. Good idea.
Um, everyone take a pad.
So when you take that vote,
you have to ask yourself,
is this young woman
capable of murder?
Could Bianca Price pick up a gun
and shoot her sorority mate in the chest?
Okay.
Six guilty, six not guilty.
Of course.
Which is so odd,
given we have six men and six women.
Oh, what are you saying?
This is a sexist thing?
Well, of course not. This has nothing to do with her looks.
True.
That's right.
She's just a sweet girl having a threesome.
That's because men can't imagine a pretty woman killing somebody.
Oh, come on.
It's because the prosecution didn't do their job.
Exactly.
Oh, fine.
Sure, I voted not guilty, but not because of her looks.
Why isn't it just as likely that women are jealous of her looks?
Thank you, brother.
You are so over the line.
Thank you.
He's right.
So over the line.
He's right.
Women look at that girl and think home wrecker.
Except she's not a girl. She's a grown woman.
Okay, but saint-- what-what's her name?
Alicia.
Right, Alicia Florrick.
She was sitting right next to her, supporting her.
And defense attorneys could never be pulling tricks.
Let's just stick to the facts, huh?
All right, all right, everybody,
raised hands, please.
One at a time.
Marisol.
Okay, take the cop, the detective.
Back on the first day of testimony,
He looked right at us and said...
The accused was covered with blood.
And she was the only one in the room with the victim.
And the murder weapon?
9mm auto 6-round.
It was the defendant's,
registered in her name.
Given to her by her mother for protection.
The weapon was found on the ground by her feet?
Yes, sir.
With her fingerprints on the trigger.
I have a question.
Who was the girl who entered in the middle of his testimony?
Oh, that's right. He smiled at her.
I thought she was with the defense.
There was a party downstairs for spring break.
30 individuals.
And they heard the shot?
Yes, sir.
Within 30 seconds, they burst into the sorority room
and found the accused, Bianca Price, standing over the victim.
How long after the murder was this photo taken?
Approximately 30 seconds.
It's the good news about murders at colleges these days.
Everybody has a cell phone camera,
so it makes it hard to get away with murder.
Objection!
That wasn't a question, Mr. Gardner.
But I would warn the witness to avoid editorializing.
My apologies, your honor.
Now, this happened at her sorority house?
Yes, sir.
There was blood all over her.
And this was taken within 30 seconds of the gunshot,
and here she is with the gun at her feet.
She said she was in the bathroom, and she came out.
No, she didn't say that.
Her lawyer said that.
Now Bianca has said she was in the bathroom when she heard the shot.
Objection, your honor. Not in evidence.
Mr. Gardner, I expect more of you.
Your honor, I'm sorry. My mistake.
Okay, I'll say it.
I didn't trust that cop.
And his earring. What was that?
Men wear earrings these days.
And what about the five o'clock shadow?
So what are you saying?
You don't trust him because he didn't shave?
So, detective Burton, you were the first officer on the scene?
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
And where was your partner?
He was out sick.
So you were there unobserved?
Yes, I was unobserved,
except for the two dozen other college students in the room.
And you've never tampered with evidence, detective?
That's correct, sir.
I've never tampered with evidence.
And so if I asked you about this internal affairs report...
Objection, your honor!
Mr. Gardner, really.
Up here.
Then what about the internal affairs report?
What internal affairs report?!
We didn't hear anything about that.
It could have been completely innocent.
Are you serious?
This charge is irrelevant, and it was minor.
Drinking beer on duty?
You are playing with fire here, Mr. Gardner.
Your honor,
any internal affairs charge is completely relevant.
No, sir. You're trying to imply to the jury
that something more nefarious is going on here--
that detective Burton planted evidence.
Let's at least be adults here
and admit to each other what you're doing.
Your honor, no. Oh-oh, my god,
No. No. I...
Look, I will admonish the jury.
That's all I can do, Mr. Brody.
And you watch it, Mr. Gardner.
Go to hell.
Having fun?
Wait. Wait. Wait.
The judge admonished us not to consider it.
All right, I won't consider it,
but I still don't trust speedy.
We'll reconvene here 9:30 tomorrow.
So, you enjoy tarnishing my reputation?
Best part of my day.
Hey, Jimmy, man.
What's up?
I don't think they liked me.
Who, the jury? No. You can never tell.
I just...
Sound so terrible.
I think I'd find me guilty.
No, that's just the prosecution's case.
You wait for our turn.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Any time.
Thank you.
I'll see you, mom.
How did it go, did you think?
It's a good start.
I'm sorry, but we're playing catch-up here.
Your previous lawyers did no investigation,
and cuesta isn't allowing a delay,
so we're gonna hit a few bumps.
We're gonna need to spend some more money
on a better ballistics expert.
Are you all right with that?
Whatever it takes.
She's my only child.
The thought of her in prison is...
Good work.
Thanks.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Why? Yeah. Good.
I heard you did well.
There's more women on this jury than I wanted.
Sometimes I think
justice would be better served with a coin flip.
Who's that?
Oh, uh, Mother Jones.
Doing a profile.
Sorry about that.
We're knee-deep in the Bianca Price trial.
You were just saying about pro-choice.
Oh, yes, it's an irony of our times
that "activist judge" used to be a charge hurled by Republicans at...
Democrats?
Excuse me?
Hurled at democrats?
Oh, uh, yes.
I was, um...
The charge of activist judge,
especially with regards to...
My goodness, I forgot what I was, uh, saying.
Choice is endangered.
Oh, yes, choice.
It is.
Could you give me a minute?
Thank you for the Sarah Palin biography.
Oh, I, uh, I thought you'd like that.
The chapter where she brings big oil to heel.
Just gripping.
I bought a, uh... a Hillary bio
for 50 cents on eBay.
So you're, uh...
Will says he wants you on the Bianca Price murder?
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm, uh... I'm in Town testifying on another case.
Good.
Well, I-I just wanted to say hello.
Hello.
You betcha.
Uh, you know my rules.
If, uh... If I find out the client's guilty, I quit.
Yup. I like your rules.
Even more, I like your fees.
Well, th...
Yeah?
I thought I'd sit in.
Miss Lockhart.
Mr. McVeigh.
So, the problem is,
The mom fired her previous lawyers
because they wanted to plead this out.
So they lined up Jim Crosby as a ballistics expert.
Well, I agreed to meet with you.
You did. Thanks.
And I agreed to look over the evidence, give you a bid.
Which is?
I'm not taking this case.
She's guilty.
Sorry.
I can give you some names of people who will say differently,
But I wouldn't go with Crosby.
He's not convincing enough.
Um, you're positive?
She's guilty?
Given the evidence, yes.
If I were you, I'd plead out.
Good luck.
The jury needs to be told a story.
The prosecution's story is simple:
Bianca shot her best friend out of jealousy after a threesome.
Our story needs to be just as simple:
Bianca didn't shoot Heather.
Yes, it was Bianca's gun,
But her mother had given it her for protection.
What we need to tell the jury is who else had access to Bianca's gun?
Joshua Mundy...
See any difference?
He was with the girls for the threesome,
who shot Heather while Bianca was in the bathroom.
No. Why?
Regarding the witness prep, Cary, Alicia,
We're gonna have to delay on the ballistics expert.
Why?
We lost him.
We're shopping.
Okay, that's everything.
We got court in one hour, so let's go.
Will?
What's up?
This cell phone photo on Jenny Bauer's student page,
It's different than the one she gave to the police.
There. On this one, that guy's foot is on the rug,
And on this one it's not.
She took another picture?
Only a split second between both shots.
It's on video.
Cell phone video.
Find it.
I'll get that for you.
Thanks.
I don't know if we're gonna put Bianca on the stand yet,
but if we do,
Are you all right questioning her?
I'm... Yes.
But I think
Cary would do a better job.
Why?
They seem to have bonded.
15 years of doing this and I still can never tell
who's innocent and who's guilty.
Everybody's a mystery from the outside,
Including Bianca.
We still haven't had our dinner.
I know.
You worried about Peter?
I'm worried about everything.
I'm not.
All right, all right,
All right! Everybody, let's talk one at a time, please.
Marisol.
Of course he was scuzzy.
I don't want to marry him. I just believe him.
It was Heather's idea.
Heather Cross, the victim?
Yeah.
She's never done a three-way before on zolpidem, and she wanted to.
This was the night before spring break.
Yeah-huh.
She came to me downstairs, and she was, like, um...
Do you want me to quote?
'cause if I quote, I have to use that word.
Oh, no, you don't, Mr. Mundy, not in my court.
When you feel so inclined,
You are welcome to use the word "Fluff."
And Judy-- delicate flower that she is--
will translate it into its proper form. Yes, Judy?
Okay. So, um...
There was, like...
"Do you want to go... fluff upstairs with Bianca on zolpidem?"
And I was, like...
It was something she read in the whole Tiger Woods thing--
Zolpidem sex, you know? Relaxed and crazy.
And I was, like, you know?
No, I don't know, Mr. Mundy.
You'll have to use your words.
I was, like, "Sure."
I mean, um... "Fluff, yeah."
Oh, the joy my life is.
Have you got that, Judy?
And you and Bianca had been dating?
Yeah.
And she was always kinda freaking out about women,
so I was surprised that she agreed to go with us.
"Freaking out" meaning jealous?
Yes.
Then what happened?
Well, we... fluffed.
And I mean fluffed.
And, uh, I left the two of them
Kinda out of it in Bianca's room,
and I went downstairs to grab a brew.
And that's when we heard the shot.
And I raced upstairs,
and I found Heather on the floor, you know, like,
Really red with blood and the gun on the floor.
Oh, that's right.
You're here on another case.
That's right. We're ready.
You want to watch?
Oh, well, I-I would,
But I'm late.
Dinner?
Tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m., the Westin.
I, uh,
Uh, o-okay.
So, you'd been dating Bianca for a while?
Uh, a little while, yeah.
A little while, as in two dates?
Yeah, I guess.
And by "dates," we mean you slept with her twice?
Yeah.
You have that effect on women?
They get jealous after two dates?
Objection. Argumentative.
Sustained, regrettably.
Now about this zolpidem that Heather and Bianca took, you took it, too?
Yeah.
And you know zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic?
What?
You can hallucinate on it.
You might also get diarrhea.
well, I...I didn't get diarrhea.
Good. I'm so glad.
But did you hallucinate?
No.
It's also a drug that can cause memory loss.
Did you know that?
No.
In fact, let's do an experiment.
Objection.
You know I like experiments, Mr. Brody.
Overruled.
What color panties was Bianca wearing that night?
What color? Uh...
White.
Well, that is a very good guess, Mr. Mundy,
Given that 85% of the panties sold in the U.S. are white.
And yet you're wrong.
They were black.
See? That was silly.
Men don't remember things like that.
The color of a woman's panties? Are you kidding me?
Not at that moment.
And you're telling me
she's having sex with her boyfriend, another girl,
and she's not jealous?
Well, actually, that was a stretch for me.
I mean, she only slept with the guy twice.
That doesn't make him a boyfriend.
So are you changing sides?
Now you're not guilty?
No. I don't know.
I just...
The motive seemed ridiculous.
College today-- a threesome doesn't mean anything.
I'm getting old.
I'm going back to college.
All right.
I think we should take another vote with our hands.
All those in favor of not guilty?
Seven to five.
Now we're getting somewhere.
I want to know how those voting not guilty can explain the picture.
What I don't understand, Miss Bauer,
is I looked at your student page, and there's a different shot.
See, this one's from an earlier frame,
and this one's from a later one...
from your cell phone video.
Are you with the cops?
Well, I've been assigned to investigate.
I erased it.
The video?
I don't believe you.
Anyone who brags about helping the police
on their student page isn't gonna erase anything.
Look, I wasn't trying to hide anything from the police.
I know you weren't.
It's just I'd never done it before.
Done what?
Okay, Tim,
I do this for you...
You do this for me.
I was drunk. We were just sexting.
If my parents saw this...
It's okay.
We don't need to tell them.
Josh went up before the gunshot.
What?
Josh went up before the gunshot.
He said he went up afterwards.
Oh, my god!
We need to get out of here.
Who's Josh talking to?
Who's that?
I've seen him at the gym.
Josh is always hanging out with him.
I think he's on the coaching staff or something.
This guy. Who is he?
Oh, Ernie Suarez, assistant to the athletic director.
Does he have a locker here-- Ernie?
Yeah, a coach locker, but he hasn't cleared it out yet.
It's right there.
You got the keys?
Um, don't you need a warrant or something?
Yeah, if I were a cop.
I can get bolt cutters in here,
But it'd be easier if you just opened it.
So you're not a cop?
No.
And you're not with campus police?
So who are you?
Kalinda.
Someone's been busy.
Campus police checked the serial number on the computers.
They're from a series of 30 campus burglaries over the last year.
Good. So the narrative is this:
Josh killed Heather after she discovered him burglarizing her room.
Listen, I'm gonna go catch a ride with campus police
when they go check Josh's room for more stolen goods.
Good.
Is that our ballistics expert?
We'll see. I'm interviewing him now.
God help us.
What's going on?
What?
...is going on?
Will doesn't even look at you anymore.
He does.
You been a bad girl?
Going now.
In other news,
Sarah Palin spoke to party members in Texas
as part of her nationwide tour.
Palin took aim at the president again over national security.
We need a commander in chief,
not a professor of law standing at the lectern.
America is ready...
So, professor, you're saying this is consistent
with the prosecution witness, Josh Mundy,
firing the weapon that killed the victim?
Yes. This is... Yes, I am.
Even without evidence of gunshot residue on his hands?
Yes, that's right.
Could you explain?
Well, yes, I, um...
Uh, let's see, uh...
Here we go.
So the path of the bullet,
Darn it.
The gun was at chest level,
held by someone as tall as the accused,
and was shot from three feet away.
The defense ballistic expert--
when he finally got his laser pointer working...
Objection.
Withdrawn.
He argued that the gunshot residue found on Bianca Price's hands
could have come from her contact with the victim.
Does that seem likely to you?
No.
I don't know.
Two experts say the exact opposite thing,
and they're both 100% certain.
So what do we do with that?
There was this CSI: New York,
where the gun residue
was transferred from one person to another.
They say it happens all the time.
But that's TV.
Yeah, but I've heard it some other place.
Me, too.
So it's not impossible.
It's also weird how little there is, you know, physical evidence.
There's the GSR.
Yeah, but what about the forensic stuff?
The DNA?
So, wait, you two are changing your minds?
So, let's take another vote.
All those in favor of not guilty.
Okay, six to six.
Yeah, but it's a different six, so that's progress.
Campus police. Coming in.
All right, go ahead, check it out.
Anything?
Is your plan just to follow me?
Yep. It's the only way I can get more from you than you from me.
What's up?
Josh finishes his threesome, goes downstairs to get a beer
in his shirtsleeves.
Where did you get this?
Josh heads back upstairs.
Bianca in the bathroom hears the gunshot.
Everybody runs up and seconds later, as if by magic,
Josh in his leather jacket.
He's cold. He puts on a jacket, it happens.
Or he uses it to cover the gunshot residue off his hands.
Are you writing fiction these days?
There's only one way to find out.
Check that for gunshot residue.
Where would I go?
What do you mean?
What prison?
Dwight correctional center.
Is that big?
I don't know.
We've got a really good case.
I know.
Just the people at school, they don't visit.
If my roommate were in prison, I guess I wouldn't either.
I don't know.
45 years.
That's a worst-case scenario.
Would you visit me?
Yes.
Thank you.
I'm being stupid.
No.
No, you're not being stupid.
This silently stoic thing--
that's all just a pose, right?
When you get home, you start spouting Proust?
Yep.
Yep.
Well, to cowboys.
Who knew I loved cowboys?
Maybe it's in our DNA.
Part of being American.
You don't need to talk like that.
I do need to talk like that, because that's how I talk.
You know, there's a selfishness to the silence of the cowboy--
Forcing everybody else to carry the weight of the conversation.
Whew, what am I doing?
No, I mean, really, what am I doing?
You're having dinner.
I mean, you like Sarah Palin, and I-I...
I think she's the devil incarnate.
Yep.
And choice--
I mean, how can you be for back alley abortions?
The murder of 1.2...
Don't-don't talk.
Stoically silent?
I can't.
I can't, I'm sorry.
I want to, but I-I can't.
You have to go?
I want to stay,
But 3 generations of democratic ancestors are screaming out in protest.
That's a lot of generations.
I hope it's good.
We're struggling here.
Potentially good.
They found gunshot residue on Josh's jacket.
His... Where are you?
Police station.
Listen, they found something else on it, too--
Heather's blood.
They're interrogating Josh now.
Okay, I'll have to get a continuance.
You may not have to. The cops are all over this.
Look, I'm outside the interrogation room.
Phone me when you get something.
I'll call the troops, we'll line up the witnesses.
A different ballistics expert.
Ahead of you.
What?
Malt ball?
What happened, Burton?
Well, he did burglarize those dorm rooms.
He was actually in league with Heather.
They were planning to rob your client.
Makes sense.
Trying to kill his cohort in crime.
And the lab confirms that is GSR on the jacket and Heather's blood.
Okay...
I'm not seeing how this is bad yet.
Well, it's not-- for me.
The blood and the GSR were on the inside lining of the jacket.
So he wrapped it around his shooting hand.
Josh said the jacket was on the floor of the bedroom.
He heard the shot, got into the room,
Grabbed the jacket from between Bianca and Heather,
put it on and wore it home.
Because he's guilty.
Yes... of burglary.
I'm not an advocate here, Kalinda.
I don't lie to make things better for a client.
I just look at the facts.
And the facts are against you.
Right.
Yeah.
Oh, sorry, Alicia. It's late, I know.
No, no, no, no, I'm up.
Look, we ran into a problem with the narrative.
I think we may need to put Bianca on the stand.
I thought Kalinda had something.
It didn't pan out.
Do you think you'll be able to handle questioning her?
Yes.
We're in a weird place, I know.
It's okay.
No. I don't like being in a weird place.
I know.
Me neither.
When I look at you during the day,
I want to know what you're thinking.
Sometimes I don't even know what I'm thinking.
Will...
Yeah?
If it had been differently...
...At Georgetown, if-if it had been us and not Peter,
We would have lasted a week.
No, we wouldn't have.
We would have.
It's romantic because it didn't happen.
If it had happened, it would have just...
been life.
Will don't say that, please.
I don't understand.
9mm auto shot 6
They don't make them anymore 'cause they have a hair trigger.
The slightest pressure fires the mechanism.
An accidental firing?
Yeah, but not the one that you'd expect.
The prosecution was correct.
The shot came from three feet away.
The weapon was in the drawer of your client's bureau.
Heather was a thief,
and when Bianca was in the bathroom,
Heather checked the drawer for valuables, money.
Oh, my god.
She checked the drawer with the weapon...
...reached in to take it,
And...
You're kidding.
The shot was fired from three feet away,
But vertically, not horizontally.
And it was accidentally fired by Heather.
There's no service in here.
And once it was fired,
the gun fell to the floor.
The problem was there was no blood or gunshot residue below the impact.
That's why I didn't see it.
He took his jacket.
That's right.
Mr. Mundy took his leather jacket from the floor,
and that had the blood and the GSR on it.
You'll testify to this?
Of course. Usual fee.
The problem is, it's not a good story.
It's just a freak accident. There are no villains.
But if it's true...
But it doesn't sound true.
The prosecution's story sounds like the truth--
There's a villain: Bianca, there's a motive: Jealousy.
This story just says there's no rhyme or reason.
Everything's random.
Well, we're not trying to teach a lesson.
Just win a verdict.
There's another problem.
We've already set our story that Josh did it.
Even our own ballistics expert supported that.
Right. We'd have to contradict our own ballistics expert.
Well, there's an another way to settle this:
Ask the client.
So that's what happened?
That's what our ballistics expert said happened.
So, I don't know. Do we put this new evidence on the stand or not?
Which is smarter?
Well, that's up for discussion.
Our worry is we tried one defense with the jury,
And now if we try another, we might do two things:
Undercut our credibility
and hurt our chances if the jury was believing our first defense,
that Josh did it.
So what should I do?
You go with the truth.
The truth has the advantage of being true,
and on some level, the truth is always more believable.
Then that's what we go with, the truth.
And you believe the gunshot was self-inflicted?
Well, I don't believe.
The science points there.
The gunshot was accidentally self-inflicted.
Thank you, Mr. Mcveigh.
No problem.
As you said, Mr. Mcveigh,
You originally didn't want to testify in this case?
Yes. I thought Miss Price was guilty.
Right.
Then two days ago you had an epiphany?
Well, if by epiphany you mean a new piece of evidence--
this jacket with bloodstain and GSR--
Then yes, I did have that.
A change of heart?
Not my choice of words, but I won't object to 'em.
You're staying at the Westin
while you testify in another case?
Yes.
This is a hotel where many prosecutors house their witnesses?
Yes, I believe that's true.
It's a hotel where several prosecutors observed you
meeting with another lawyer.
Is that a question?
No.
Here's the question:
Two nights ago before you magically changed your mind
about this case, did you have dinner with a partner
from the law firm, Stern, Lockhart & Gardner?
Yes.
Objection!
The question's been answered, Mr. Gardner.
Yes, your honor, I'm sorry, but it was answered too quickly.
Well let me overrule just as quickly.
And after this dinner, the partner in question,
Diane Lockhart,
joined you in your hotel room?
Yes.
And did you have sexual relations?
Objection, your honor! How is this relevant?
Well, I would imagine that Mr. Brody would say
that the witness's testimony was bought these alleged sexual relations,
isn't that correct, Mr. Brody?
It is, your honor.
Well, Mr. Brody, I will sustain Mr. Gardner's objections,
But I don't think you'll mind much
because you just threw a stink bomb into the lap of the jury,
And now you're running for cover.
Your honor, this is an instance...
And, Mr. Gardner, yes,
I see the outrage on your face,
which I might be more moved by if you hadn't done
the exact same thing with Detective Burton's testimony.
Excuse me, your honor, with all dues respect...
Please, your honor...
No, no, no.
This one we're calling a draw, gentlemen.
You have both been playing fast and loose
with implications, not facts,
so we're gonna try and let justice take care of itself.
You have any more questions, Mr. Brody?
No, your honor,
But we do request a limiting instruction.
Members of the jury,
in weighing Mr. Mcveigh's testimony, you may consider any potential bias
in assessing the weight you want to give to what he had to say.
You know, I think it's almost medieval.
They toss us in here, they lock the door,
They throw a lot of contradictory evidence at us,
And then they expect us to come up with a fair decision.
I mean, come on.
So...
...Shall we take another vote?
I am finished with this conversation.You're in my office.
You don't have the courtesy...
You don't understand what you did to this firm.
Okay, I'm getting out of here.
Did it even occur to you to tell me?
No, it didn't.
I was under the mistaken impression that it was my life
It's your life when it doesn't impact our clients.
It didn't impact our clients.
Diane, the jury ate it up.
It was sex.
It wasn't GSR or ballistics, it was sex.
I'm going home.
If you had just told me.
If you had just given me a sign!
Come on. Come on.
Don't be a hypocrite.
A hypocrite? How am I a hypocrite?
Alicia.
That's supposed to what, make me quake,
Make me humble?
Make you honest.
There's nothing going on with Alicia.
That's not true.
It is true.
Will... I have two eyes.
Then use them.
Watch me.
Watch us.
There's nothing going on with Alicia.
Turn out the lights.
Prosecution's come in with a last-minute offer:
Second-degree murder, ten years.
We don't have a lot of time.
When the verdict comes in, the offer goes away.
You'd be 34 years old, baby.
You'd still...
You'd still have a life.
But if they find you guilty...
45 years, no parole.
2055. I-I...
What do you think?
I think you didn't do it...
And the jury will see that.
Really?
Yes.
You only need one juror.
Yes, but if you're wrong, you'll go back to work,
and I watch my daught...
Oh, my god, I can't do this.
I know.
Can you give us a minute?
Mom...
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
Listen, listen, they were just arguing the opposite!
Which they're allowed to.
They're the defense.
But two ballistic experts, one saying one thing,
The other saying...
They're the defense.
The whole point is to poke holes in the prosecution's case.
Yes, but this ballistics expert said
two days ago he thought one thing, now he's thinking another--
Right! And what if in three days more he thinks something else?
Hey, doc,
You look depleted.
I guess I am.
I don't know.
I sit here listening to everybody talk,
And I just feel like we weren't given enough information.
So what do we do?
Do you have reasonable doubt?
I don't know.
I just have...
Reasonable ignorance.
Kalinda, we've got a problem.
The bailiff's warning that the verdict's coming in.
Okay.
Bianca and her mother want to talk to us.
Oh, no.
Yep. Where's Cary? We need Cary.
Why?
She likes him. Maybe he can talk to her.
Okay.
Okay...
We're unanimous.
Oh! Yes!
Finally. Good job.
Democracy in action.
All for $15 a day.
I bet a lot of jurors trade numbers and say they'll stay in touch.
but I bet nobody does.
Why don't we just save time and not trade numbers?
Hello, judge.
I thought I'd just join you in here and thank you for your service.
Unfortunately, I now need to excuse you and thank you for your service.
What did we do?
Nothing.
You did your job well.
This happens sometimes,
And there's no way to prepare for it.
The prosecution and defense have agreed to a plea bargain just seconds ago.
You're kidding me?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not.
This happens sometimes
when one side or the other worries about the outcome.
So again, thank you.
I hope this doesn't diminish your enthusiasm for the court system
Because in another year you're gonna get another summons.
So what happened?
What was the plea bargain?
Oh. Miss Price agreed to a charge of second-degree murder.
Ten years.
Thanks again.
