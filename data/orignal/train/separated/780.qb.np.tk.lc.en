you know what that is ?
either male genitalia ,
or a really big thumbs down .
why would he send me male genitalia ?

well , without me , they get so weird
and they fight all the time .

well , winston ,
after 25 unanswered text messages
to nick and jess this morning ,
i finally received a response .
a smiley face .
this leaves us with one choice :
to become best friends .
huh ? yeah , fine .
for r ... ? okay , great .
now , as my best friend , i expect you to
be willing to sacrifice everything for me
at a moment &apos;s notice , including , of course ,
unfortunately for you , your dignity .
yeah , fine .
winston , what can i do for you ?
don &apos;t talk to me that much , never lie to me ,
and never , ever touch my puzzle .
winston , do we ... do we think now
is really the right time to be starting a puzzle ?
i &apos;m great at puzzles .
you &apos;re a born puzzler , winston .
sure .
um , but ...
don &apos;t you agree that sometimes ,
when you start puzzles , you get a little bit weird ?
and , i don &apos;t know , intense ?
spend a lot of time humming .
also spend a lot of time naked .
i &apos;m gonna do you , puzzle !
right on the table .
as nasty as you want to be .
hey , schmidt , what do you think it &apos;s gonna look like ?
what do i think it &apos;s going to look like ... ?
yeah , the puzzle .
winston , it &apos;s on the box .
the ... the picture &apos;s on the box .
it &apos;s a japanese garden !
schmidt , calm down . what is your problem ?
two women are in love with me .
the problem is , is i &apos;m in love with both of them .
okay , looks like you &apos;re gonna have to choose .
cece and i , we have this connection .
you know , it &apos;s physical ... it &apos;s unhealthy .
look , i don &apos;t want to get too graphic with you ,
but i &apos;m not just the plug with her .
i &apos;m also a socket .
god ... okay , fine .
schmidt , choose cece .
yeah , but ...

it &apos;s a ... you know ,
it &apos;s a very difficult decision
that i &apos;ve had to ... that , you know ,
that you guys have put me in , here ,
but i just ... i &apos;m gonna be candid .
i &apos;ve been up for 24 hours .
i have to return all of these gifts .
so just say it .
you don &apos;t want to be with me .
wh ... huh ?
look ... look at that .
i just looked down and i thought ,
&quot; this girl must be wearing sneakers
with shoelaces , and th @-@ those shoelaces must be tied together ,
because this girl is straight trippin &apos; , yo . &quot;
what ?
of course i want to be with you .
but i feel so terrible for elizabeth .
how did she take it ?
sh ... she took it .
in the marketplace of ideas , where ...
culture is king ,
and data moves faster than people ,
where scalable opportunities come from turnkey solutions ...
what are you trying to say , schmidt ?
is it over ?
no ... no .
as if .
of course i picked you ; it wasn &apos;t even close .
come here , you crazy white girl .
there it is .
poor cece .
uh , yeah , okay .
i fell asleep .

those cops look like they &apos;re about 15
and they have huge guns .
jess , are we in mexico ?

we &apos;re in mexico !
oh , my god , pull over !
that pinata &apos;s shaped like a monkey !
you know what ? it &apos;s gonna be weird
going back to having sex
without a bunch of feral dogs watching .

and , like , we had all those problems ?
yeah .

we &apos;re totally out of money .
we got this great setup .
no , this is not gonna last long .

this is a badly built shelter .
we &apos;ll go right there .
how hard could that place be to sneak into ?
you all in ?
nick , this has been fun , but ...
okay , look , everything that &apos;s bad
is waiting for us back in the loft .

i &apos;m proud of you .
i know it must have been tough .
hey , schmidt , who do you call if puzzle pieces are broken ?
oh . hey , winston .

on my end , that i am so , so sorry .
sorry about what ?
you know , uh ... elizabeth .
well , what about elizabeth ?
he made love to her .
winston made love to elizabeth .
after i chose you ,
winston was all too quick ,
in elizabeth &apos;s vulnerable state ,
to rush in there and just get his jollies off .
his sweaty ,
disgusting jollies .
seriously ?
i mean , she must have just been
so upset and hurt ... i mean , i didn &apos;t even know
you were interested in her .
tell her what you did , winston ,
and give her the short version ,
which you did not give to elizabeth .
wha ... ?
what i did ... um ...
okay , well , i drove over there ...
... to seduce her .
and i seduced her ...
two and a half times .
puzzle me this , then , winston ,
how do you live with yourself ?
i have a bit of a hard time believing
that winston would do this .
well , then , obviously you don &apos;t know winston ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s a sick , disgusting human being .
just this morning he asked me for a pair of your underpants .
winston ?
is that true ?
yes .
i needed your underwear to ...
sew into my underwear .
oh ... my ... ... god .

we &apos;re not friends at all ...
until you fix this .
okay , all right , look .
winston , i &apos;m sorry , man .
