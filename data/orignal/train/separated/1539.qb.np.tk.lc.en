good morning , madam president .
may i introduce you to the ambassador of java ?
oh , thank you .
because , after all , what is a travel mug
but a closet for your coffee ?
and boom , our next promotional giveaway .
throw on a black turtleneck and some mom jeans ,
it &apos;s like i &apos;m married to steve jobs .
i did hear you banging out e @-@ mails
till all hours last night ,
so the cucumbers in the sandwich can be repurposed
as lunchtime crow &apos;s @-@ feet refreshers .
thank you .
don &apos;t forget we &apos;ve got drinks later .
right . any specific joke areas i should stay away from ?
oh , no , don &apos;t worry about it .
it &apos;s mostly just me and the guys talking business .
hey , you using those spin classes i got you ?
yeah . i went twice last week .
you can &apos;t tell ?
sure , i can .
the best part about taking over my dad &apos;s company --
i am now a powerful white male , and i love it .
i totally get now why we don &apos;t want anyone else
to have what we have .
honey , before i take off for work ,
i saw this and i thought of you .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a key ?
yeah , it is .
it is a key ...
but a key to what ?
no !
no !
you got me a phunkeeduck ? !
no more walking for my man . walking &apos;s for jerks .
oh , my god ! that is the best gift ever !
i don &apos;t know where it stops and i begin !
where is it ? where is it ?
you know , these cheese cubes keep getting smaller every week .
i should start saving these to prove my point .
wow , am i retired .
it &apos;s there !
it &apos;s beautiful !
a little revealing .
i mean , i get using sex to sell your hot sauce .
that &apos;s why i wore jordache jeans in my old closet ads .
but a little much , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s obviously working .
the store said that they put out
100 bottles of my sauce , and half of them are gone !
oh , my .
auntie alice !
she &apos;s a hot @-@ sauce legend .
her level three sauce
has a picture of a rooster exploding .
i have to go meet her .
hey , guys , take a pic .
hey , get out of here ! that &apos;s my wife !
i am a huge fan .
i have read your life story on your label a thousand times .
is it true that your father crashed his pepper truck
into a papaya tree and the legend was born ?
you &apos;re asking me if something &apos;s real ?
i can &apos;t believe that that cutout &apos;s an actual person .
miles ?
oh , hey , jay .
uh , trying to read a text .
they keep the lights in here so low
so they don &apos;t have to rotate the produce .
don &apos;t give me that .
i &apos;m sorry , man .
i &apos;ve been lonely since reynetta left .
you &apos;re a deacon .
honey , foot rub .
pass .
okay , there it is again !
i &apos;m telling you , something weird is going on up there .
we &apos;re renting our upstairs unit to earn a little extra cash
and add a little extra tension to our marriage .
our current guests registered
as mr. and mrs. wilkerson and tommy .
i was expecting a nice young couple and their little boy .
hello . you --
so , you -- you must be mr. and mrs. wilkerson ?
that &apos;s right .
so you &apos;re tommy ?
he is .
welcome .
cam , let &apos;s help them with their trunk .
no !
no ? okay , well , uh , here is the key .
here you are .
thank you .
tommy ?
okay , what is that all about ?
i mean , three adults ?
why doesn &apos;t tommy have a last name ?
why doesn &apos;t tommy talk ? is he their captive ?
is mrs. wilkerson their captive ?
is the captive in the trunk ?
so there has to be a captive ?
lately , we &apos;ve been getting negative reviews
from some of our renters .
say it .
and they tend to follow the common theme
that the &quot; bigger one &quot; is &quot; nosy . &quot;
while others say the &quot; orange fella &quot;
is &quot; standoffish and cold . &quot;
who says that ?
i &apos;m saying it now .
okay , we need to find out what that is .
cam , stay out of their business , all right ?
if we drop below three stars ,
we &apos;re gonna be stuck renting to chain smokers
and pregnant foreigners trying to have their babies in america .
mark down the time . i just turned into my father .
i &apos;m going up .
cam ...
cam , what are you doing ? !
i am checking on our guests .
hello ! oh , all three of you .
uh , just stopped by to see if you guys need
some fresh -- fresh towels .
we &apos;re fine , thank you .
uh , yes , you were gonna say something ?
you saw that , right ?
mrs. wilkerson was giving me the distress signal .
she was like ...
come on .
cam !
us again . just triple @-@ checking
to see if you need some hand soap ,
a chance to talk to one of us alone , some muffins .
really , we &apos;re fine . you don &apos;t have to keep checking .
help !
she did not say &quot; help . &quot;
so you did hear it .
hey , delgado , thank your mom for my new screen saver .
will do , parker .
and speaking of two @-@ dimensional women
who know a thing or two about sauce ,
stop by flanagan &apos;s and say hi to your mom for me .
i know you were bothered by that cutout .
but every teenager gets teased ,
and you have to rise above it , so --
your mother &apos;s in the trunk .
what ?
i couldn &apos;t stand the ogling and the selfies ,
so i stole it -- for both our sakes .
we &apos;re in this together .
how ? i didn &apos;t steal it .
oh , i see where this is going .
you complain and complain , i make the problem go away ,
and you had nothing to do with it .
i didn &apos;t ask for this . i didn &apos;t ask for any of this .
let &apos;s not turn on each other . it &apos;ll make us sloppy .
i need your help to get rid of it .
god knows i &apos;ve already tried .
son of a ...
son of a ...
a lot of cool storage solutions coming out of asia , huh ?
yeah , there really are .
but i think you might be even more interested
in what &apos;s been coming out of cuba .
is she the best or what ?
shall we , hmm ?
let &apos;s do it .
you know what , honey ? we are just gonna talk about work .
why don &apos;t you stay and have another drink , huh ?
well , you don &apos;t have to twist my arm .
what do you say , ladies ? another round of sapphire sins ?
ooh , yes , please .
phil , you are just so much fun .
thank you .
oh , it is so nice to hear those words
come out of a man &apos;s mouth .
tell me about it .
ever since kyle got that promotion ,
he barely acknowledges me .
come on , now , i &apos;m sure he knows how lucky he is .
you have the twins , a spotless house ,
killer yoga arms .
this happens all the time --
they get on their track to success ,
and you become the invisible housewife .
i don &apos;t know about all the time .
sitting with all those gals , i thought ,
&quot; wow , this is an insane amount of perfume . &quot;
&quot; and also , am i on my way &quot;
&quot; to becoming an invisible housewife ? &quot;
no way . there &apos;d be signs , right ?
hey , stranger . been keeping dinner warm for ya .
oh , that &apos;s nice . i had a steak at the club .
but i wouldn &apos;t knock a scotch out of your hands .
sure thing .
hey , is now an okay time
to go over this list of house stuff ?
let &apos;s see .
don &apos;t care , don &apos;t care , call a guy , don &apos;t care .
guess who got the big listing on westmount today .
oh , that &apos;s great , sweetie . it &apos;ll keep you busy .
is that a new bracelet ?
oh , yes , it is .
jim bought it for me after our last big fight .
i was on him about taking all those business trips .
that &apos;s what they do .
throw some new piece of jewelry at you to keep you happy .
mm @-@ hmm . not that i &apos;m complaining .
hello .
right ?
oh , good , mom &apos;s car is gone .
all right . my handsaw is in the garage .
you &apos;ll hold her down , i &apos;ll cut the head off .
jay !
my car got a flat tire , so it got towed .
i need a ride to phil &apos;s .
he &apos;s helping me finish my sauce website .
manny , baby , why are you crying ?
i &apos;m not .
ooh , i got another e @-@ mail from the store .
i bet you that i sold another --
what the hell ? somebody stole my cutout .
stolen ? damn it !
well , there &apos;s no point in replacing it
because it &apos;s just gonna get stolen again .
i can &apos;t replace it .
it took two weeks
just to get the mechanical arm working right .
oh , wait till i catch this rat .
i &apos;m going to make him regret that he was ever ...
hey , jay , turn the heater on .
i can hear manny &apos;s teeth chattering .
what is that noise ?
i don &apos;t hear anything .
what is that thumping noise ?
manny , go check the trunk .
uh , i don &apos;t really feel like getting my hands dirty , jay .
your hands are plenty dirty already , buddy boy .
go deal with it .
i am going to find who did this , jay ,
and i &apos;m going to make him hurt .
every thief makes a mistake .
gloria , you &apos;re letting this get to you .
you know what always calms you down ?
joe &apos;s little duck song .
now , let &apos;s -- let &apos;s get that going .
i hate him .
* quack , quack , quack , join the duck parade *
i want blood !
* waddle , waddle , waddle , waddle , watch them wade *
* tail up , head down *
* shake your feathers all around *
* everybody &apos;s smiling at the duck parade *
this grainy security footage is all the store sent ?
i feel like i know him , phil .
whoever it is , it looks like they want to get caught .
he keeps going back for the cheese cubes .
i can &apos;t watch this anymore .
let &apos;s just work on my website , okay ?
sure .
phil , i &apos;m late for an appointment with a client .
can you do me a favor ?
if it &apos;s to put flowers in the bathroom , i already did .
oh , i hadn &apos;t noticed .
not surprised .
okay , i was supposed to get this client a bottle of scotch .
i haven &apos;t had time to do it myself .
so can you pick one up and bring it down to the office ?
whatever you need .
i have to go out for a haircut anyway .
great .
except i got a haircut yesterday .
okay , wow . this kitchen really is a mess , huh ?
i &apos;m off .
don &apos;t .
excuse me , gloria .
apparently , i don &apos;t know how to keep a kitchen clean .
what is that ?
oh , it &apos;s just a little hush @-@ up gift
from my powerful wife who thinks she can take me for granted .
and i &apos;ll just hover after her like a little puppy dog .
you have to stop putting up with it .
they don &apos;t mean to ignore you , but it will only get worse .
one time when i had just married jay ,
i spent a whole day cooking his favorite dinner .
beef wellington and a baked potato with all the fixin &apos;s ?
yes .
and then when he got home , he barely noticed what i have made .
so i took the emerald pendant that he had bought me
for the three past dinners that he had missed
and i threw it at his head .
i told him i don &apos;t need fancy things .
i need the respect .
isn &apos;t that an emerald pendant ?
it made its way back to me .
but the point is that you have to make a statement .
you have to give back the hoverboard .
you know what ? i hate to admit it , but you &apos;re right .
phil ?
this happens .
you just got to let the battery run out .
we &apos;re out of stamps . i &apos;m heading to the post office .
do you need anything ?
no , i &apos;m good .
what are you doing ?
oh , uh , just a little research .
&quot; wilkersons plus adults tommy plus mysterious trunk . &quot;
okay , now try googling
&quot; irrational meddling plus homosexual . &quot;
okay , mitchell , what if they &apos;re a part of some weird cult ?
remember that &quot; 20 / 20 &quot; we watched
where they infiltrated the ritual ceremony
and elizabeth vargas had to almost sacrifice a squirrel ?
i went through the bag they dumped in the trash .
now you &apos;re involving our daughter ?
i don &apos;t know what she &apos;s talking about .
okay , you know what ? you need to get out of the house .
go get the stamps .
and a hobby .
okay , well , they &apos;re in our home ,
and i &apos;m just trying to protect our family .
i don &apos;t want to wake up dead .
i can &apos;t believe i have to say this to you again .
you cannot wake up and be dead .
it &apos;s an expression !
it &apos;s not .
daddy should not have involved you in his snooping .
so you don &apos;t want me to tell you what i found in here ?
no ...
well , of course i looked .
and inside i found latex gloves , a bottle of bleach ,
heavy @-@ duty tarp .
now , i &apos;ve never killed anyone and cleaned it up ,
but that sounds like a kit .
so as soon as i saw them drive off
in their windowless murder van , i @-@ i ran upstairs .
oh , my god !
what are you ?
the people are back !
is this gonna be a daily thing now , tommy ,
losing your phone ?
oh , thank god .
wait . where are you going ?
um , what &apos;s up ? i &apos;m still getting stamps .
look to your left .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m hiding . they &apos;re here .
i came up to see if anything weird was going on .
did ya ? were you curious ? gettin &apos; a little nosy ?
not the time .
what are these creepy things ?
if these dolls could talk ...
they &apos;d tell you i dropped one and then their head came off .
well , you have to put it back .
maybe they won &apos;t notice one of them &apos;s missing .
yeah , this seems like a casual interest .
oh my gosh , here they come .
okay , i &apos;ll create a distraction so you can get back in there .
i simply invited them to a complimentary cocktail hour .
even possible satanists enjoy a triple @-@ cream brie
and a crisp chardonnay .
so , what brings you all to town ?
we &apos;re here for the chuckled chums convention .
i &apos;m sorry , the -- the chuckled chums ?
they &apos;re a line of ceramic figurines .
we &apos;re avid collectors .
well , that sounds fun .
yeah .
every year we gather together with like @-@ minded chum lovers
to share our favorite pieces .
yes ? you -- you want to say s--
help !
oh , bless you , darling .
you &apos;ve probably guessed . i &apos;m the figurine restorer .
we &apos;re so excited .
ours is this year &apos;s featured collection
because of its size and pristine condition .
i hope the industrial polisher we brought wasn &apos;t too loud .
no , we can &apos;t hear anything that goes on upstairs .
okay .
all right .
oh , no .
no , no , no , no , no ! no , no , no , no , no !
no , no ! no , no , no !
oh , god , no !
fortunately , chuckle chums
aren &apos;t all that expensive to replace .
they &apos;re mainly just an excuse
for lonely people to go outside .
point is , we learned our lesson . no more snooping .
absolutely .
although we still don &apos;t have an explanation
for those creaky floorboards in the middle of the night .
heavy @-@ footed going one way , light coming back .
was it tommy joining his chums for a menage a trois ,
then being replaced by mrs. wilkerson on the couch ?
okay , you need ... help !
son of a bitch .
i broke two saw blades on this thing ,
and now these miracle shears are no good .
guy who sold me these at the front door
cut through a horseshoe .
hold on . let &apos;s try your shredder .
what &apos;s that doing down here anyway ?
i made an executive decision
about some of joe &apos;s lesser artwork .
help me lift this thing .
hey , it &apos;s working !
the best shredder money can buy .
in 2004 , our whisper @-@ close hamper technology
got stolen out of the trash , got sold on the dark web .
never again .
oh , no , it &apos;s stuck !
hola !
hey , you &apos;re back early , huh ?
yeah , i didn &apos;t want to go back to that store
and get angry again .
i just want to relax .
yeah .
manny !
uh , yes , mama ?
can you please draw me a bath
with those fancy bath salts that you have ?
oh , i usually save those for spec--
just draw the damn bath .
i &apos;ll get you a nice glass of wine to go with it .
oh , okay .
come on , honey ,
i got a nice chardonnay out here you &apos;re gonna like .
is that stella ?
no , definitely not .
what did you bring ?
gloria , wait .
gloria , don &apos;t be mad .
it must have been that old witch , auntie alice !
she must have left this as a warning !
devious .
dang it , i got my fingerprints all over it now .
i bet she was the one who gave me that flat tire .
who are you calling ?
who was that ?
she &apos;s going to pay .
you don &apos;t even know it was her .
whatever that was , you got to call it off .
i know it was her . i saw the evil in her eyes .
she probably has cataracts .
oh , for god &apos;s sake , gloria , i did it .
i stole the cutout .
you ?
i didn &apos;t love the way those guys were taking pictures with it .
jay , but you &apos;ve never been jealous like this .
well , when we first met ,
but then i realized it &apos;s a full @-@ time job .
i &apos;m sorry .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with being protective of your wife .
it means that you care .
is something bad happening to that poor woman ?
i don &apos;t know details . i let them decide .
they don &apos;t like to feel managed .
i &apos;m begging you to make that call !
auntie alice spoke at career day at my high school !
hello ?
no , we didn &apos;t order flowers .
that &apos;s them . tell them no tulips .
uh , no tulips .
they hung up .
good thing that i remembered the code .
okay , now , my big jealous man ,
let &apos;s go and have some wine .
i don &apos;t know why that cutout bugged me so much .
i guess probably because i have more time now to be jealous .
okay , now , you have more time to take me upstairs
and show me what those
bad men were doing to me at the store .
i &apos;m getting back to liking retirement .
i told you to say no roses , right ?
tulips !
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s fine .
here &apos;s the scotch you asked for .
and also , there &apos;s something else .
i &apos;m returning the hoverboard .
fine . i @-@ i think the receipt was in the box .
okay . well , good .
because i can &apos;t accept a gift if it &apos;s just a shiny
servo @-@ controlled substitute for respect and appreciation .
i &apos;m not invisible , claire .
you married a strong and capable man who --
can you help me with this clasp ?
claire ?
honey ?
no . don &apos;t cry .
i @-@ i can , uh -- i can keep it if you want .
i @-@ i can &apos;t return it anyway . i already dented it .
no , it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s just all of this . i &apos;m so stressed .
phil , i &apos;ve never been a boss before ,
and i am freaking out .
but you &apos;ve been handled it so well .
i am faking it , phil . i have no idea what i &apos;m doing .
i &apos;m just copying my dad --
the steak , the scotch , the cigars .
do you have any idea how bad the heartburn is ?
but you just got here . give it a little time .
there is no time . i &apos;m in charge now .
and i live every day in constant fear
of everyone discovering that i &apos;m a fraud .
oh , my god , i really am a powerful white male !
hey , you are not a fraud .
i haven &apos;t had the guts
to sit at my dad &apos;s desk since he left .
i still feel like the little girl
who used to play hide @-@ and @-@ seek under it .
look .
this is your desk now .
you &apos;ve earned it .
you are not a little girl anymore .
in fact , you &apos;re the strongest ,
smartest woman i know .
the hardest company in the world to run is dunphy co . ,
and you &apos;ve kept us in business for 22 years .
i don &apos;t worry about you in this job .
i worry about the poor chump who has to follow you .
everyone is here for your meeting , claire .
knock &apos; em dead , boss .
uh , phil , wait .
oh , sorry .
thank you ...
for everything .
thank you .
and i &apos;m sorry if i don &apos;t say it more .
come here .
i guess you want to get rolling on your meeting .
i &apos;ll just duck out .
take it .
thank you .
claire ?
i love you .
okay , margaret .
no , no , no , no , no , let me spin !
it &apos;s worse if you try to help .
send them in .
phil ?
oh , no , not again .
should we wake him up ?
oh , i read the instructions .
it says not to .
hello .
what ?
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m a realtor .
i &apos;ll be right there .
i have a really early meeting .
i &apos;m on it .
thank you .
