if being sentimental were a sport ,
my mom would &apos;ve gone pro .
each moment of our lives was documented , decorated ,
and preserved forever in one of her many creepy scrapbooks .
his little body &apos;s changing .
you said that was to show the dermatologist ! lies !
my dad , on the other hand ,
wasn &apos;t quite as sentimental about us .
bye , dad .
have fun at camp or college
or wherever it is you &apos;re going .
it drove him crazy that my mom would commandeer the garage
to obsessively save every little piece of artwork ,
doodle , and drawing that we have ever done .
it accrued slowly over time until that fateful day
of the great goldberg avalanche .
are you kidding me ? !
oh ! damn it !
help !
bevy !
i could &apos;ve been killed !
oh , poop !
you ruined adam &apos;s jelly bean diorama of
custer &apos;s last stand .
poopies !
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m cleaning this whole place out .
no ! where am i gonna hide my six @-@ pack of ... homework .
and the magazines i &apos;m holding for a friend .
hide it in the woods like every other kid !
all this crap has got to go !
it &apos;s not crap .
every box is filled with priceless family memories ,
each one more valuable than the next .
bevy , we are drowning in our children &apos;s art projects .
you have literally kept every drawing , every doodle ,
every macaroni necklace they have ever made .
did you know that albert einstein &apos;s
first macaroni necklace just sold for over $ 1 million ?
einstein , huh ?
which child would that be ?
hey , bar ?
it was january 7 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and erica was finding a new and exciting way
to torture us .
ha ! look , it &apos;s barry &apos;s baby helmet .
no ! i thought we gave that back to the institute .
you were so cute with your little flat head .
i used to rest my kool @-@ aid on you .
well , my head &apos;s perfectly round now .
oh , my gosh . it &apos;s a picture of you all helmeted up .
this is gonna look great in the yearbook .
no , please , show mercy .
yep , my sister had a gift for making our lives
a living hell .
the more public the humiliation , the better .
why ? !
you wore tear @-@ away pants . this is on you .
hey , adam .
oh , balls !
it &apos;s your potty pal , remember ?
mom bought him for you
because you thought monsters lived in the toilet .
they weren &apos;t monsters !
they were toilet trolls .
aw , is pudgy wittle adam still too scared
to make poo @-@ poos now , huh ?
oh , like you &apos;re so perfect with all your -- your trophies .
and your &quot; a &quot; papers ,
and your -- your framed commendation from the mayor ?
seriously ?
yeah , nice try .
well , let &apos;s see what treasures lie in this box .
nothing to see here , bye @-@ bye .
it &apos;s an old box of your new kids on the block stuff .
you still love them .
no , i &apos;m way too old to like boy bands .
then i &apos;ll throw them away for you .
no ! don &apos;t touch them ! they &apos;re mine !
yep , long before one direction and &apos; nsync ,
there was the original boy band --
new kids on the block .
you still love the new kids .
you &apos;re lame .
you love &apos; em .
no , you guys are lame sacks of ...
just shut up !
damn it !
she got away with all our ammo !
not all of it .
how ?
sleight of hand .
and you thought magic camp was for dorks .
i still do , but good work .
after years of one @-@ sided torture ,
we finally got some ammo .
oh , hey , guys .
and it would change everything .
it &apos;s erica goldberg , your number one fan .
and i wanted to make this video
so that you could see firsthand how much i love you
and wanna marry you .
but not all of you . just you , jonathan .
in fact , i wrote a song about you .
so i &apos;m gonna -- i &apos;m gonna sing it for you .
* jonny *
* jonny , jonny *
* i love you *
i love you so much !
i do ! i @-@ i love you !
* i love you *
i love you so much !
i always knew one day a good thing would happen to me .
and that day is now .
do you know what this means ?
her reign of terror is finally over .
and we must annihilate her .
absolutely .
don &apos;t steeple your fingers . i &apos;m steepling mine !
we can &apos;t both do it .
if anybody should be steepling , it should be me .
your fingers are weird .
what ?
no , they &apos;re not . what are you talking about ?
how &apos;s that weird ?
how can you say that with a straight face ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s that weird , man .
they &apos;re like witch &apos;s fingers .
meanwhile , my dad had laid down the law .
my mom was allowed to fill a single trunk with our art .
sadly , it didn &apos;t have infinite space .
bevy , we &apos;ve been at this for hours .
please move it along . come on .
oh ! adam &apos;s family portrait from kindergarten .
i gotta keep this .
what are we , a family of potatoes ? toss it .
all right , fine , but you can &apos;t expect me to get rid of this .
oh , yes , i can . it &apos;s a turkey . we get it .
it &apos;s his little hand preserved forever .
he still has a hand !
adam ! come down here and show your mother your hand !
oh , now it &apos;s all ... huge and gangly .
don &apos;t you just miss those pudgy little baby hands ?
it &apos;s just a crappy turkey . toss it !
and toss the blue banana and the dog with six legs !
okay , you seriously can &apos;t tell me that erica &apos;s finger painting
makes you feel nothing .
i feel something -- confused . who the hell &apos;s &quot; babby &quot; ?
it says &quot; daddy . &quot;
she made her little d &apos;s backwards .
you &apos;re her &quot; babby . &quot; how do you not feel anything ?
i &apos;ll tell you how , and it &apos;s simple .
our children are not talented .
you &apos;re a monster .
well , that would explain why i have three eyes
and lobster hands .
toss !
okay , fellas , it &apos;s all gotta go .
are you sure bevy &apos;s fine with this ?
absolutely . she &apos;s more than fine .
then why do i feel her eyes on me
like a thousand tiny daggers ?
i let her keep her one trunk . that &apos;s more than fair .
trust me , once that stuff &apos;s at the dump ,
she &apos;ll forget all about it .
all right , that &apos;s everything .
thank you .
i feel good about this .
wait , where &apos;s the trunk ?
hey , wait ! hey , hold on !
wait , wait !
stop ! stop !
all right , you run after them , i &apos;ll go get the car keys .
why do i have to run after them ?
you &apos;re spry . it &apos;s your thing .
how &apos; bout you run , i get the keys ?
you can &apos;t drive !
get off my jock , mur .
i &apos;m making this stuff up on the fly here .
fine ! we &apos;ll both get the damn keys .
that truck is gone .
yes ... it is .
come on in !
we just invited over a few pals
for a little video premiere party .
no .
i like it when you said your hand was jonathan
and then you made out with it .
no !
wait , you made fun of me for my corey feldman shrine ,
and all along , you were doing this ?
no !
yes .
no !
let &apos;s play it again , shall we ?
stop doing what you &apos;re doing and turn it off .
turn it up ? yeah , you got it .
turn it off !
barry , the attic !
my sister was furious
she had lost all the power , but not half as mad
as when she saw what we did to her room .
donald .
why are you doing this to me ? !
we just wanted to make sure you had ... &quot; the right stuff . &quot;
just take your stupid flat helmet head
and get out of my room .
normally , that would send me into an emotional tailspin .
but from now on , no matter what you say ,
you &apos;re just a borderline adult woman
who likes lame boy bands .
no ! you do not have the power . i have the power .
oh , no . for years , our stupid life choices
and physical awkwardness has given you ammo
to humiliate us , but no more !
i say , no more !
and just like that ,
erica &apos;s childhood dreams became her adult nightmare .
it had been three days
since we started using new kids to taunt erica .
unfortunately , all that musical exposure
led to some unintended consequences .
* first time was a great time *
* second time was a blast *
* third time i fell in love *
* now i hope it lasts *
what are you doing ?
me ?
like , right now ? just ...
you know , bagging on erica and her stupid music .
by singing along ?
yes !
i mean , how am i really gonna torture erica if i don &apos;t know
all the words to the song ?
it was a wobbly premise at best and there &apos;s no way he &apos;d buy it .
that &apos;s a good point , dude .
it is ?
yeah .
&apos;cause i might &apos;ve memorized their entire album .
smart ! that &apos;ll really piss her off !
what &apos;s your favorite song ? to torture erica with .
that &apos;d be a 10 @-@ way tie between all of them !
take that , erica !
can you believe her favorite new kid is jonathan knight ?
i mean , hello , he &apos;s the shy one .
yeah , but you put him on the dance floor ,
he blows everyone away .
of course !
that &apos;s why i learned all of joey mcintyre &apos;s lyrics !
&apos;cause he &apos;s like me , the youngest and the cutest
and always getting into shenanigans .
joey ? ! if anything , you &apos;re a jordan .
&apos;cause your voice is all high
and you &apos;re cocky when you shouldn &apos;t be .
oh , yeah ? well , you &apos;re a danny .
please . i &apos;m donnie , the bad boy , and you know it .
can you knobs please keep it down ?
i &apos;m trying to study .
why ? you studying with your boyfriends
danny , donnie , joey , jon , jordan ?
gosh , shut up with that !
i have the power !
see ? i know at a glance i have danny aspects ,
but donnie has that roughneck appeal
that ladies love !
hey , you know what would totally drive erica nuts ?
if we learned all their dance moves .
know what else would really rub her nose in it ?
we do a shot @-@ for @-@ shot remake of their music video .
yes !
oh , yeah . all right .
i &apos;m gonna go cut off the sleeves of my jean jacket ,
you go gather up some leather vests ,
and that &apos;ll really stick it to her !
while my brother and i were fooling ourselves ,
my dad and pops were hoping to fool my mom
by forging our old artwork and putting it
in a duplicate trunk .
there you go .
good as the real thing .
the hell is this ?
you said adam drew a potato family .
not actual potatoes ! potato @-@ shaped !
and what are they doing on a farm ?
where else would a potato family live ?
it &apos;s too good ! it &apos;s supposed to be awful .
well , we gotta fill up this trunk with something ,
and all we got is a few macaroni necklaces ,
a blue banana , and this glittery thing .
it &apos;s supposed to say , &quot; i love you babby . &quot; babby !
what the hell is a babby ?
i &apos;m the babby !
it &apos;s too good . do it again , and do it worse .
hey , i got talent . i can &apos;t suppress it .
in fact , if you don &apos;t want my potato family ,
perhaps &quot; the new yorker &quot; will .
i give up .
there &apos;s no way bevy &apos;s gonna believe this crap .
what are you gonna do ?
the only thing i can do -- come clean and end this .
my dad hoped she would take it well ,
but she didn &apos;t .
well , on the bright side , our garage is clean .
okay , you win .
i will never make you throw anything away again .
promise ?
yes !
you can hoard whatever crap you want from now on .
you won &apos;t hear so much as a grumble from me .
well , that &apos;s a start .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i need to , uh , be alone to mourn the piece of my heart
that died today .
my dad came clean , but my mom was playing dirty .
to teach my dad a lesson ,
she had paid the haulers to stash our art here .
okay , so for the monthly storage cost ,
i &apos;m gonna need a credit card .
mm , no , no , gabe .
this will be a strictly cash transaction .
no paper trail that way .
um , that &apos;s kind of weird , but okay .
see , i had all these pieces of my kids in these boxes ,
and someone tried to take them away from me .
we can &apos;t have that , can we , gabe ?
that day , my mom &apos;s guilt trip worked a little too well .
my dad actually went down to the local dump
and searched for our art with a can @-@ do attitude .
man , look at our moves ! our lines are so crisp .
in your face , erica !
wait , i &apos;m confused .
how exactly is this a joke on erica ?
um , earth to chad kremp .
it &apos;s called a parody , like weird al . look him up .
but weird al changes the song into a joke .
this is clearly a labor of love
executed by two superfans .
so , apparently , that whole revenge plot on erica ?
it took a strange turn .
it seems like it , yes .
you need to destroy that tape !
for sure .
but i didn &apos;t . that was some of my best work .
so i hid it under my bed --
a decision i would quickly regret .
* listen up , everybody , if you wanna take a chance *
* just get on the floor and do the new kids dance *
* don &apos;t worry &apos; bout nothin &apos; *
hey , come on in .
we &apos;re just having a little video premiere party .
no !
adam , i thought you destroyed the tape .
i couldn &apos;t do it ! our lines were so crisp .
dude , this is way worse than erica &apos;s tape
&apos;cause at least she was , like , young ...
and a girl .
i &apos;m sorry , adam , i didn &apos;t wanna watch ,
but then i just couldn &apos;t look away .
we &apos;ve watched this video four times .
we &apos;re watching it again !
yes !
guys , come on .
you showed that video to all my friends
and the girl of my dreams ?
and my girlfriend !
i can only take so many hits like that
before she comes to her senses and dumps me .
i mean , you handed me the ammo . what did you expect me to do ?
oh , please ! you &apos;ve always had the ammo .
&apos;cause we &apos;re the easiest targets on the planet !
making fun of adam for his lazy eye
and his inability to hit a baseball ,
and his stupid haircut .
his bad breath -- - okay , okay , okay .
and then there &apos;s me !
always gunning for one of my many awesome qualities
that you feel threatened by .
just once we had the upper hand .
oh , i see , so you can dish it out ,
but you can &apos;t take it .
we always take it !
you &apos;re our big sister . you &apos;re supposed to protect us ,
but you always just make things worse .
while my sister was feeling like garbage ,
my dad was still knee @-@ deep in it .
you gotta be kidding me .
as fate would have it ,
he stumbled upon a box of children &apos;s art .
yeah !
unfortunately , my dad had no freaking clue
it wasn &apos;t ours .
whoa , now . what &apos;s happening ?
you would not believe my luck , al .
i went down to the dump ,
and i actually found one of the boxes .
and i had &apos; em framed .
i really hope that wasn &apos;t expensive .
incredibly expensive .
you know , at first , i was doing this
so bev wouldn &apos;t hold it over me forever ,
but as i look at my children &apos;s art ,
i realize i was wrong to throw it away .
out of curiosity , who would this be ?
well , that &apos;s , uh , me , uh , and mr. chair .
and since when does mr. chair have wheels ?
and since when is your name &quot; abuela &quot; ?
what do you think that means ?
it means this is someone &apos;s hispanic wheelchair grandma ,
and you &apos;ve spent a fortune framing a stranger &apos;s art .
also , this call came in .
hey , it &apos;s jenkintown storage .
that larger unit opened up for your boxes and your trunk .
give us a call .
you know what i think happened ?
i think bevy lied and made a fool out of you .
it had been two days since erica outed us as blockheads
and we still weren &apos;t talking to her .
hey , guys . got a couple cold ones .
i decline your hollow peace offering of an ecto cooler .
and i will take it , but it changes nothing .
come on , guys . you can &apos;t give me the silent treatment forever .
oh , we can , and we will .
too much finger . put it down .
enough , okay ?
brothers and sisters torture each other .
that &apos;s how it works .
if you &apos;re so upset about it , then just do it back .
we &apos;d like to , believe me , but here &apos;s the thing --
that new kids ammo is all we ever had on you .
please stop acting like i &apos;m so perfect .
you saw my video .
i had braces and glasses and frizzy hair .
look at this ! this is what braces look like ,
not your cute little metal ones .
mine has a chin strap . a chin strap !
okay ! you &apos;re pathetic fish in a barrel .
what do you want from me ?
to stop humiliating and belittling us .
we &apos;re just asking for basic human decency .
what all men want !
ooh , god . i can &apos;t do it .
i &apos;d like to say yes , but it &apos;s impossible .
right , &apos; cause you have the power .
you always have the power . i hope it feels good .
while erica was striking out with us ,
my dad hoped to strike back against my mom .
uh , what &apos;s going on here ?
good news , honey .
i just spent six hours wading through toxic garbage ,
and look , i found our kids &apos; art !
great !
you were right .
from now on , we &apos;re keeping every piece of art
&apos;cause each one is a masterpiece of love .
you know about the storage unit .
of course i know !
you made me go to the dump !
well , what was i supposed to do ?
you were gonna throw it all away .
secret storage was my only option .
i just want one room with my special things .
and now i guess you &apos;re gonna take that away , too , huh ?
and that &apos;s when my dad decided to stop torturing my mom .
actually , i already did .
turns out , my dad was sentimental after all .
you schlepped it all back ? for me ?
just do me a favor and try to ...
thin it out a little bit .
but won &apos;t you miss your garage ?
yeah ...
but you never know , one of our morons can turn out
to be the next einstein .
hey , need a ride ?
uh , no . we &apos;re gonna walk , thanks .
wait , come on , just --
come back !
wow , nice new kids shirt .
you got us good .
i &apos;m not wearing it to bust on you .
it &apos;s an olive branch .
new kids third row center ?
look , i thought we could go .
sure , i &apos;m too old to like them , and you &apos;re ... dudes ,
but everyone has that band that they listen to in secret .
so why can &apos;t we just go have fun at the concert
and own it ?
but ... what if someone sees us there ?
i &apos;m your big sister . i &apos;ll protect you .
that was the beginning of our sister having our back ...
when she felt like it .
it was also the beginning of my mom letting go ...
you know , i thought maybe we should hang this one up .
and my dad learning the value of holding on .
turns out , being called &quot; babby &quot;
did make him feel something .
and as we danced in a sea of 12 @-@ year @-@ old girls ,
we realized that some things from your past
are worth hanging on to .
donnie !
you &apos;re the best !
yeah ! he pointed at me !
sure , you might think you &apos;ve outgrown them ,
but deep down , they always stay in your heart .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s nice to hold on to your memories ,
even if they &apos;re tucked in the back of your closet ,
to remind you of where you came from
and the people who knew you when .
我童年的罪恶快感
* listen up , everybody , if you wanna take a chance *
* just get on the floor and do the new kids dance *
all right , and we &apos;re rolling .
world &apos;s most badass &quot; hangin &apos; tough &quot; music video ever made ,
take one .
