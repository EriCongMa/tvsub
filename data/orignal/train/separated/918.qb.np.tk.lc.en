the &apos; 80s had a lot of pop trends ,
and my sister was into all of them .
it all began with new kids on the block .
danny , donnie , joe , jon , jordan .
danny , donnie , joe , jon , jordan .
most of these trends lasted only a week or so ,
some even shorter .
girls just want to have fun , am i right ?
and it &apos;s over .
in fact , the styles changed so fast
that at school it was nearly impossible to keep up ,
especially for geoff schwartz .
&apos;sup , erica ?
really feeling the flock today , am i right ?
flock of seagulls is so last week , geoff .
we &apos;re all about debbie gibson now .
but i used an entire jar of honey for this .
i &apos;ve been fighting off bees all morning .
i told you . i &apos;m not gonna date you
just &apos; cause we love the same music .
yeah , bro . if anything ,
you should hate her guts for the crap she listens to .
whoa , i &apos;m sorry .
do you have a problem , johnny atkins ?
my problem is your music sucks .
big mistake , bro .
yo , back me up , jtp .
that &apos;s a polite pass , bro .
your hair suggests you
don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing with your life .
well , you dodged a bullet , homeboy .
for your sake , back off my girl .
not your girl .
i love you , erica !
you will be !
you guys need to get a clue .
there &apos;s only one band on the planet that matters .
rush .
here we go .
not again .
rush sucks .
i hate you .
they &apos;re not the canned garbage that you listen to .
they &apos;re real . they &apos;re from canada .
it &apos;s super @-@ cold ,
so they have to rock super @-@ hard to stay warm .
i &apos;ll take your word for it .
why take my word for it
when you can come to my corolla and find out for yourself ?
unless you &apos;re afraid .
of being alone with you in your rusted @-@ out piece of crap ?
for sure .
johnny atkins respects women .
he has bad hair days , too .
not many , though .
you ready to step into the musical cocoon
and emerge - a rock- &apos; n &apos; -roll butterfly ?
just play it - so i can be proven right .
in that moment , my sister &apos;s mind unlocked ...
... as she was ushered into a world of prog rock .
today &apos;s tom sawyer
mean , mean pride
it was an instant attraction
in more ways than one .
i don &apos;t even know - what &apos;s happening right now .
oh , my -- - this is a terrible mistake .
one you &apos;ll make again .
don &apos;t tell anyone .
i can promise that i won &apos;t .
but i definitely will .
there &apos;s one thing - you should know about me .
i &apos;m painfully honest .
you &apos;re a fox , but you also wear too much makeup like a clown .
see ?
knock it off , you two .
you &apos;re on school grounds .
and you &apos;re in my parking spot .
the window &apos;s rolled down so i know you can hear me .
hello .
cut it out .
it was april 1980 @-@ something , the morning of my birthday .
and that meant one thing .
there &apos;s my little birthday schmoops !
all i want for my birthday is for you to not call me schmoops .
aww , you &apos;re cute .
so , look , i know how much you like big hollywood directors ,
like steven lucas and george spielberger ,
so i special @-@ ordered you this .
don &apos;t hurt your little arms . it &apos;s heavy .
my own oscar ?
read it !
&quot; best son . &quot;
yes , you are ! and that is gonna go great
with the big hollywood @-@ themed birthday party i &apos;m throwing you .
speech !
for once , can &apos;t i plan my own birthday ?
what ?
what is this ?
&quot; best son &quot; ?
you gave adam a golden trophy ?
that squeaky @-@ voiced turd ?
honey , it &apos;s not what you think .
oh , i think this is exactly what i think .
this tiny golden man
is nonliving proof of what i &apos;ve always known .
adam &apos;s your favorite .
that is not true .
i love all my kids equally .
i don &apos;t have a &quot; best son &quot; trophy .
the only things you ever gotten me
are expensive gifts from the store .
take it . this trophy represents
everything that &apos;s wrong with my life in this house .
no . i want my own trophy
&apos;cause i &apos;m better than adam at everything .
can he soothe animals with just some peanut butter and a smile ?
can he eat an entire apple in just two bites ?
give me an apple right now .
bad start . give me another .
don &apos;t waste my apples .
look , i &apos;m sorry you feel this way ,
but there &apos;s nothing that &apos;ll convince me
that i play favorites .
see that ?
adam &apos;s photo is twice the size of ours !
this is a misunderstanding .
the photo guy made it the wrong size ,
and i couldn &apos;t return it .
please . i &apos;ve seen you return a dead goldfish , used chapstick ,
and a bathing suit dad wore for 10 straight days in puerto rico .
that liner was destroyed .
destroyed .
i know the truth and so does he .
just look at that smug little face lording it over me .
adam ? ! where are you ? ! you &apos;re so dead !
oh , no . what have i done ?
you &apos;ve woken me up .
barry thinks i got a bigger photo of adam
&apos;cause he &apos;s my favorite .
every parent has a secret favorite .
mine &apos;s erica .
you can &apos;t say that .
i don &apos;t have a favorite .
beverly . come on . come on .
it &apos;s adam , damn it .
he &apos;s my cute little munchkin who sweats when he sleeps
and then i flip the pillow over to the cool side and --
and then he whispers , &quot; love you , mama , &quot;
and then i just want to gobble his delicious face !
okay .
my god . barry &apos;s right .
well , starting now , he is gonna know what it &apos;s like
to be my number @-@ one son .
get back here ! you will pay for what your picture did !
i was just reading a book !
this makes no sense !
as my mom was coming to terms
with who her favorite child was ,
my sister had no doubts who her new favorite band was .
wait . what is happening ?
why are you covering up debbie g. ?
&apos;cause i discovered something infinitely better --
rush .
holy crap .
you made out with johnny atkins .
you &apos;re a bad little girl .
how could you possibly know that ?
because he &apos;s the only other person i know
who &apos;s obsessed with that lame wizard band .
also , he &apos;s telling everyone .
oh , god , i knew i shouldn &apos;t have made out with him .
you don &apos;t actually like him , do you ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s like a cocky band nerd ,
but he &apos;s also honest and deep ,
but he also has a ponytail .
it &apos;s so confusing .
i &apos;ve dated the biggest jerks on the planet .
trust me .
you need to end up with a nice guy like barry .
okay , please don &apos;t gag when i mention your brother &apos;s name .
why are you gagging ?
i &apos;m sorry , but her gaggy face is making me gag .
stop .
yo . it &apos;s johnny atkins .
yo . so ?
so , erica &apos;s expecting me .
mind if i just pop upstairs , chill for a few ?
yes , very much .
all right . then give her this flier .
battle of the bands this weekend .
speed up &apos;s gonna win top prize .
speed up ?
my rush cover band .
thinking erica could join us
&apos;cause our guitarist got arrested for selling ...
fudge .
fudge .
so good , it &apos;s illegal .
okay .
well , are you gonna have her call , or ...
i wouldn &apos;t do that if i were you .
i &apos;m not letting ponytail johnson anywhere near my daughter .
trying to keep them from each other is a classic mistake .
it &apos;ll only make her want him more .
just like with you and bev .
please . you loved me .
no . i hated you real bad .
thought you were a stubborn grump .
first night , i nicknamed you &quot; el lumpo . &quot;
&apos;cause you &apos;re a lump .
yeah , yeah . i get it .
really bad @-@ mouthed you to everyone .
backfired big @-@ time ,
so when you think about it , you &apos;re welcome .
this is hurtful .
just leave it alone for a week
and it &apos;ll go away on its own .
was someone at the door ?
i &apos;m not sure . murray , did someone stop by ?
no , he did not .
while my dad was ignoring pops &apos; advice ,
my mom was about to turn all her attention to barry .
the heck is this ?
just a &quot; best son &quot; trophy for my real best son .
here &apos;s the truth .
you are an amazing athlete with a ton of trophies .
i only gave adam one for &quot; best son &quot;
so he wouldn &apos;t be jealous of your greatness .
see , this makes sense .
and to prove you really are the best son ,
i &apos;m gonna focus all my time and energy on you .
just please don &apos;t say anything to adam .
and hurt his feelings ?
i would never .
sorry , sucka ! barry &apos;s number one .
the trophy &apos;s mine forever .
cool .
hope you enjoyed your day as &quot; best son &quot;
&apos;cause now mom &apos;s only gonna focus on me .
wait .
did she really say that ?
absolutely .
oh , my god .
you literally are the best brother ever .
and the best son .
my mother &apos;s rejection of me
is the most wonderful birthday gift i could ever get .
it &apos;s your birthday ?
from the bottom of my heart ,
thank you , barry norman goldberg .
you &apos;re welcome .
i feel like you &apos;re trying to tell me something ,
but i &apos;m too excited to figure out what it is !
hello , father .
tell me something .
by chance does this &quot; battle of the bands &quot; flier
look at all familiar to you ?
just say what you &apos;re gonna say .
i saw johnny atkins at school today .
he told me you slammed the door in his face .
oh , that .
yeah , i only did that because he &apos;s a piece of
you get it .
gonna backfire .
how could you be so shallow and judgy ?
you don &apos;t even know him .
mistake .
i know he &apos;s a teenage boy
who associates with fudge dealers .
here it comes .
johnny &apos;s , like , super deep .
he introduced me to rush ,
he makes wax hands ,
and he even wrote me a poem .
i &apos;ll read it .
please don &apos;t .
&quot; her eyes sparkle like the sun .
erica . &quot;
don &apos;t bash the poem .
i hate that poem .
and i hate that boy .
you are not going out with him .
what ? ! you can &apos;t tell me who to date !
and yet , i just did .
it &apos;s happening .
will you stop singing ominous warnings ?
it &apos;s done .
but , of course , it had only begun .
erica .
what &apos;d i say ?
you said no going out ,
which is exactly why we &apos;re staying in .
that &apos;s not in the spirit of our agreement and you know it .
yo . dad @-@ bro .
can you close the door ?
you &apos;re letting all the good vibes out .
shut up , ponytail johnson !
i joined johnny &apos;s band ,
so we &apos;re gonna be practicing here a lot .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
no , i won &apos;t excuse you !
what the hell ? !
don &apos;t do that !
do not kiss him !
it &apos;s my garage !
you hear me ? ! that &apos;s my garage !
it was only the first day of barry being the number @-@ one son
and i was already reaping the benefits .
schmoopaloo , mama has some truly tragic news .
barry &apos;s hockey game this weekend
is at the exact same time as your party .
you &apos;re -- you &apos;re not gonna be there ?
of course we &apos;ll rush right back ,
but as far as the planning goes and everything --
i &apos;ll plan it myself .
you don &apos;t have to worry about anything .
okay . headed to practice .
not yet . come and eat this chili i made you .
no , i &apos;m not gonna eat a bowl of chili before i play .
it &apos;ll slow me down !
nonsense . it &apos;ll give you strength .
it &apos;s mama &apos;s special power chili .
i don &apos;t want it .
it &apos;s loaded with meat and beans .
i don &apos;t want it .
it &apos;s mama &apos;s special power chili .
i &apos;m not gonna eat your special power chili .
look at the meat and beans .
i see the meat and beans .
i just don &apos;t want to eat the meat and beans .
eat the damn meat and beans , get some power ,
then wash it down with some bone @-@ strengthening buttermilk .
no milk and no chili . i have to skate for three hours !
that &apos;s why you need the buttermilk .
it coats the mouth and belly from all the power @-@ giving chili .
no .
there you go .
it &apos;s so beany and meaty .
feel the beefy power .
my tongue can &apos;t fight the beefiness .
mama knows .
now you &apos;re ready .
just go make a boom @-@ boom and i &apos;ll take you .
but i just have practice .
oh , i &apos;m going to every practice .
in fact , i made these
deviled energy eggs for the ride .
what just happened ?
you &apos;re her favorite .
enjoy .
y @-@ you got a little something on your --
ah , never mind .
as barry was surprised by what came with being &quot; best son , &quot;
my dad gave erica a shock of her own .
what do you know ?
all of your closest friends , classmates ,
and your teacher here in our den .
hey there , erica .
why is my guidance counselor
wearing shorts in my living room ?
please have a seat .
last thing i &apos;m gonna do is be negative about ponytail johnson ,
but -- hoo @-@ hoo ! -- they sure will .
the guy &apos;s a total tool bag , erica .
see ? i didn &apos;t say it . your best friend lacey did .
lainey .
is this a friggin &apos; joke ?
his face is a joke .
and his poetry is awful .
and the dude only wears rush shirts .
yeah , it &apos;s like , try a polo , bro .
or a v @-@ neck . i mean , what &apos;s his deal ?
what &apos;s he hiding ?
shut up , jtp !
my love life is none of your business .
and you -- why are you even here ? you &apos;re a teacher .
i &apos;m here to guide you away from dating atkins .
yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure he &apos;s an adult man
living amongst the student body as an undercover cop .
like &quot; 21 jump street &quot; ?
that makes sense to me .
you completely ambushed me .
i can &apos;t believe you .
not me .
your friends , your teacher ,
and that excitable boy who so clearly loves you .
who is it ? i &apos;ll fight him .
well , i don &apos;t care what any of you think .
in fact , if i &apos;m getting rid of anybody , it &apos;s you guys .
yeah , not buying it .
well , you better buy
&apos;cause i choose johnny over all you assclowns .
no , you don &apos;t .
i love the guy .
you &apos;re stubborn and digging in .
we &apos;ll see who &apos;s stubborn when i marry him
and don &apos;t invite any of you to the wedding .
so , i was promised pizza .
where are we on that ?
also , can we add some wings ?
i just find that they make any situation better .
eating with your hands is fun .
out .
yep , my steadfast sister was doubling down on love
while my brother wasn &apos;t sure
how much more love he could take .
hey ! ad rock !
how about a thirst @-@ quenching ecto cooler
for the birthday boy , huh ?
i &apos;m not taking mom back .
what ?
no .
but now that you bring it up ,
don &apos;t you think mom would be a killer party planner ?
i got that covered .
check this out .
the hell is this crap ?
the single greatest party in eighth @-@ grade history .
it &apos;s an overwhelming feast for the senses ,
and i have you to thank for it .
please ?
my stomach can &apos;t take any more
of that chili meat and buttery milk .
you got to take mom back .
never ! from this point on ,
you &apos;re gonna be her delicious snuggle monster ,
and i &apos;m gonna be left all alone .
don &apos;t you dare say that !
and this isn &apos;t just for this week .
this will stretch months , years , decades ,
until she moves in with you .
how can you be so cruel ?
this is what you asked for , pal .
you brought mom &apos;s love on yourself .
i hope no one comes to your ridiculous awesome party !
i have that all in my trapper keeper .
barry was miserable being the new number @-@ one son .
meanwhile , erica &apos;s band
was making my dad even more miserable .
this is crazy .
he &apos;s been playing the drums for over an hour .
you &apos;ve brought this upon yourself , murr .
it should have worked . i didn &apos;t say a word to the girl .
instead of telling her yourself ,
you had everyone else in her life gang up on her .
you took a love forbidden by her father
and made it forbidden by the world .
oh , damn it . it sounds romantic .
love ninja nunchucked my life apart
that &apos;s really good . you wrote that ?
yeah . and i never would have thought
to put a 10 @-@ minute drum solo in the middle .
i just rush &apos;d it up .
we &apos;re actually really good .
and , like , we &apos;re actually pretty good , too .
oh , boy . here we go .
yo . it &apos;s gonna be one of those .
i told you .
johnny atkins doesn &apos;t put labels on things .
the thing is , i kind of went out on a limb
and told everyone that
even though they think you &apos;re human trash ,
i &apos;ll be with you forever ,
so , yeah , kind of locked into this .
you love me . i get it .
johnny atkins is a roller coaster that only goes up .
oh , god , no .
i mean , you &apos;ve for sure grown on me , but yuck .
so you &apos;re saying - the roller coaster goes down ?
no . i definitely think
we should take things to the next level ,
even though i &apos;m kind of like , &quot; ehhh . &quot;
this is rocking my world and not in a good way .
look on the bright side .
one day we &apos;ll get married so i can prove a point ,
and that &apos;s not nothing , fella .
wait . what about practice ?
battle of the bands is this weekend .
for me . you &apos;re out .
mostly &apos; cause what you said sucked .
it was the day before my birthday party ,
and i was discovering that planning it without my mom
was a lot harder than i thought .
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;ll get the other kids sick .
i promised drinks with fog !
why would a clown need to see a picture of me
before he agrees to come ?
you can &apos;t make me a camera cake ?
you advertise specialty cakes !
oh , you &apos;re a fraud !
this is a disaster , man !
you want to talk disaster ?
i &apos;ve eaten so much power chili my body has adapted .
it &apos;s starting to crave it like water or air .
my party &apos;s tomorrow and the vendors are impossible .
i &apos;m a boy . i can &apos;t plan the hugest party ever !
mom could have done it easily .
too bad she &apos;s busy ruining my life .
i need her .
say it again !
say it !
i take it back .
adam needs you !
focus on him and not me .
what ? what &apos;s wrong ?
he misses being your little schmoopaloo .
i admit it . he &apos;s the best son .
take him back .
you really miss your mama ?
okay , fine . i do .
i miss you getting me everything i ever wanted
through fear , intimidation , and remorseless perseverance .
that is the nicest thing anyone &apos;s ever said to me .
come to mama .
but i still feel awful .
i just can &apos;t live with the idea
that you think i love adam more than you .
no . adam &apos;s your baby .
always will be .
and , man , i am more than okay with that .
okay , so party &apos;s tomorrow . what exactly do you need ?
everything .
everything ? !
don &apos;t panic . give me a phone book .
mama &apos;s got to see a man about a mini horse .
as my mom set out to save the party of the year ,
my dad realized he needed to save erica
from throwing away something she loved .
can we talk ?
like , just you and me ,
or is everyone who matters in my life
standing outside the door ?
i messed up .
i , uh , wanted to be better
than all those other crazy dads and protect you ,
but i only made things way worse .
it &apos;s just --
it &apos;s not easy seeing
my peanut all grown up and dating guys .
well , i guess we both got carried away .
i mean , i was ready to stay with some dude
just to prove you wrong .
and the worst part ?
i &apos;m really gonna miss being in that cover band .
just because you broke up with the guy ...
... doesn &apos;t mean you got to break up with the band .
battle of the bands . who &apos;s in ?
me . i &apos;ll literally do whatever you want .
not you .
i want to form a rush cover band , just the girls .
dude , does it have to be rush ?
answer after you listen .
a modern @-@ day warrior
mean , mean stride
today &apos;s tom sawyer
mean , mean pride
i love you , erica !
okay , everybody ! party faces right now !
and 3 , 2 , 1 !
happy birthday !
and so began the most epic
middle @-@ school party of all time .
hell yeah !
the river
what you say about his company
is what you say about society
catch the myth
catch the mist
catch the mystery , catch the drift
cue the mini horse .
mini horse !
in mini sneakers !
the world is the world is love and life are deep
maybe as his skies are wide
today &apos;s tom sawyer he gets high on you
and the space he invades
he gets by on you
awesome camera cake !
that fateful night ,
my sister realized she didn &apos;t need a boy
to achieve her rock- &apos; n &apos; -roll dreams ,
and i realized i may not have been the best son ,
but i definitely had the best mom .
and obviously the best dance moves .
well ,
adam hopes some day to make real movies ,
like his idol , steven spielberg .
maybe someday this will become a real one for you .
i &apos;d like to thank everybody .
my family .
and my friends .
and -- and everybody for making this possible .
thanks for being there when i needed you .
&apos;sup , erica ?
want to go out to my jetta
and listen to a little &quot; exit ... stage left &quot; ?
rush ? that &apos;s , like , so last week .
we &apos;re into the cure now .
can you guys , like , clue me in a little next time ?
this horsehair ponytail was expensive !
are you me ?
i &apos;ve had way too much fudge today .
