hypoxic even after intubation .
severe open wound to the mid and lower abdomen .
we &apos;re with her . she &apos;s part of our act .
i said &quot; titanic &quot; ! i said it !
well , i didn &apos;t hear you !
there &apos;s no such thing as magic ...
as far as we know .
okay , slow down and tell me what happened .
she &apos;s my wife and--and--and assistant .
please don &apos;t let her die .
we were--we were , uh , performing at a--at a trade show .
yeah , we weren &apos;t ready .
and while , as surgeons , we study the secrets behind
the human body &apos;s intricate network of cells ,
tissues , and organs ,
when things go wrong ...
performing what ?
it was saw the lady in half .
no way .
horribly , horribly wrong ...
and he really did with a chain saw !
there are only so many tricks we have up our sleeves
to put a body back together .
page bailey !
but there is a kind of power ...
more of a spell , really .
i &apos;m lauren .
and when we get it right ...
um , okay . hi , lauren .
it can be pretty damn magical .
no , i &apos;m the lauren as in &quot; lauren &quot; on the coffee
you &apos;re way over @-@ sugaring .
oh , g--ay ! yikes . i am--i am so sorry .
you know what ? i didn &apos;t even look up there .
it &apos;s okay .
i just grabbed it , so ...
really , it &apos;s not a big problem .

yeah , that &apos;s me .
well , now it &apos;s me .
see you around , i hope .
grey , uh , whoa .
it looks like the pelvis is involved .
we &apos;ll get more x @-@ rays in the o.r.
yeah , no , no . clearly , you have bigger fish to fry .
i couldn &apos;t hear &quot; titanic . &quot;
the song ?
no , it &apos;s our safe word .
and i yelled it , like , a hundred times
when the spring flap wouldn &apos;t open .
shut up , cherise . you don &apos;t reveal the secrets--
someone get them outta here .
you know , brooks is on my moyamoya case ,
but if you need her here--
well , i have ross , and--and i paged bailey ,
so you can take her .
what ? but she &apos;s cut in half .
this is gonna be amazing .
you know what else is amazing ? a moyamoya .
i got paged .
chain saw to the abdomen .
i paged bailey .
yeah , i have bailey &apos;s patients .
what ? still ?
but she &apos;s infection @-@ free . uh , clear to operate .
okay , well , page me when she &apos;s stable enough for x @-@ rays .
how is she still alive ?
i have no idea .
he spent the entire night ?
yeah .
he heard you say eight days .
he wants to be here when his dad wakes up .
you understand that might not happen .
well , of course i do .
but ethan &apos;s just a little boy .
nancy , nancy , you need to talk to him .
prepare him for the possibility--
i can &apos;t-- i @-@ i can &apos;t be the one
to--to add to his burden . i ...
you--you talk to him , please .
did i miss it ? is he awake ?
just because a family
overhears you say eight days ,
it &apos;s not like , magically on day eight ,
the guy &apos;s gonna wake up .
i mean , it could be day four or day ten .
oh , what is that ?
the soundtrack of your broken heart ?
you gotta get over that hairball .
i &apos;m trying , but i keep running into her .
out of order , hairball .
take the stairs .
i &apos;m dr. kepner . i hear you &apos;re having some stomach pain .
she was over @-@ served .
or roofied .
the bartender was a total skeeve .
he tried to grab my ass .
no , he caught your ass .
you threw it at him .
is she gonna boot ?
she should . good call .
you only turn 21 once , kimmy . boot and rally .
uh , can you guys focus for a second ?
can you--can , uh , can you remember when the pain started ?
at kappa sig .
no , she was making out with eric at kappa sig .
i think it was at brunch .
oh , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s probably just food poisoning or something .
can &apos;t you just pump her stomach ?
no . can you ...
uh , i need to run some tests .
you &apos;ll wait for her ?
how long ?
&apos;cause my econ study group starts in , like , an hour .
who &apos;s lauren ?
oh , god . it &apos;s actually a funny story . i was--
did you know that webber is still taking
all of bailey &apos;s patients ?
oh , yeah . she &apos;s probably holed up in the genome lab
because of that c.d.c. thing .
well , we &apos;re not the ones who called them .
if she &apos;s gonna be pissed at anyone , it should be him .
who &apos;s pissed at me now ?
well , you called the c.d.c. ,
and now bailey hates all of us .
we all called the c.d.c.
i didn &apos;t .
we should , uh , go talk to her .
oh , no . i have a consult .
how can you go work when you know bailey is mad at you ?
hey .
oh , god . i totally forgot about last night .
we were supposed to have dinner and sex .
dinner . or just the dinner .
uh , maybe the sex was all in my head .
or it could &apos;ve been in your mind , too ,
but it doesn &apos;t matter because it didn &apos;t happen .
i forgot . but i remember right now .
and i feel terrible .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna make it up to you tonight .
w--
yes . tonight .
miranda ?
miranda , it &apos;s callie .
how you doing ? can i , uh ,
can i come in ?
bailey .
i just thought you should know
that it was jackson who called the c.d.c.
i @-@ i mean , we all , you know , we all approved it ,
but i never thought you did anything wrong .
i never thought you did anything wrong .
it was--it was to clear your name .
and--which is now clear , so yay !
i feel better . do you feel better ?
bailey .
bailey , seriously ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m--i &apos;m standing right here .
you &apos;re--you &apos;re not really gonna ignore me , are you ?
bailey .
bailey ?
4 @-@ 0 .
3 @-@ 0 .
the first one didn &apos;t count . i wasn &apos;t ready .
what if he never wakes up ?
we &apos;re not there yet . okay ?
5 @-@ 0 .
i wasn &apos;t ready .
ethan .
let &apos;s go , dear .
we &apos;re going to go back to the hotel ,
just for a few hours . i need a nap .
i &apos;d rather stay here with you .
i think it &apos;s a good idea , buddy , okay ?
you can go get a snack , watch some tv .
i promise i will call you if anything changes , okay ?
the kidney &apos;s shredded .
there &apos;s nothing to salvage here .
and here is part of the large intestine .
i don &apos;t know where this bleeding is coming from .
i mean , there &apos;s too much . where is it all coming from ?
ross , ligaclip .
good god .
there are even chain saw cuts on her vertebrae .
ross , get your hands in there if you have to
and scoop out the clots .
ph is 6.9 and temp is 96.7 .
it &apos;s too much . we have to pack her .
i , uh , i just took a look at the films you did .
i &apos;ll need to plate the fracture as soon as she &apos;s stable .
oh . if she &apos;s ever stable .
okay , we &apos;re doing damage control .
got it . um , oh , i went to see bailey ,
and she didn &apos;t say a word .
dr. webber , has she spoken to you ?
right now my attention is on this patient ,
who &apos;s headed for a metabolic collapse .
okay . just let me know when you need me .
ross , faster .
the sooner we get her to i.c.u. ,
the better a chance she &apos;ll have .
mm . that &apos;s okay , iris .
yeah , her arm is still week from the t.i.a.s.
but we--we &apos;ll take care of that .
brooks , please .
iris kane , 7 years old , here for an omental flap
that will treat her moyamoya disease .
moyamoya .
boring !
hey , david .
hospital behavior , okay ?
let me go !
no , no , no , honey . mommy and daddy need to hear
how the doctors are going to fix iris .
buddy , here . look what i brought from home .
i &apos;m sorry . he just feels left out .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . go on .
karev .
uh , some of the blood vessels in iris &apos; brain ...
have narrowed and been choked off .
so i &apos;ll take tissue with healthy vessels
from iris &apos; abdomen .
and i will take that tissue , place it in her brain ...
where it &apos;ll absorb the vessels
and get the blood supply it needs .
and this will help with her arm strength .
david , buddy , come here .
just sit still , okay ?
um , david , i &apos;ll play army men with you ... ohh !
david ! i want to go ! i want to go ! i want to go !
what did we talk about ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
hands are for hugging !
uh , we &apos;ll be right back .
david !
i want to go ! i want to go !
go ahead .
you could just tell me .
they &apos;re gonna be a while .
dr. robbins , we were just getting started .
arizona .
oh , you guys know each other ?
yeah .
no .
i--we met-- we met briefly .
we had coffee .
dr. boswell is the craniofacial specialist
we flew in to help with tyler &apos;s case .
y @-@ you &apos;re dr.boswell ?
mm @-@ hmm . yeah , how about this little guy ?
brain on the outside . that can &apos;t be comfortable , huh ?
well , uh , welcome . we &apos;re glad to have you .
oh , are you kidding ?
i mean , the combination of encephalocele and facial cleft--
surgeons go their whole career without seeing one of these .
so i &apos;m thrilled to be here .
um , what &apos;s your approach ?
um , i &apos;d like to get a couple more scans
before i commit to anything .
okay , go ahead .
we , uh , we can talk strategy later .
i &apos;ll look forward to that .
can &apos;t believe we got her , huh ?
she &apos;s a rock star .
yeah , she seems , um ... competent .
she &apos;s too unstable .
we want to let her body rest
before we take her back to surgery .
but we &apos;re not gonna lose her ?
i @-@ i can &apos;t lose her .
you shoulda thought of that before you added
a chain saw to the trick .
illusion !
and i only added the chain saw to try to get us better gigs .
your chain saw drowned us out when the trap door got stuck .
ba @-@ ba @-@ ba @-@ ba @-@ ba . magician &apos;s code .
oh , my god .
okay , well , we &apos;ll let you know when she &apos;s ready
to go back into surgery .
so let &apos;s say i pursued a different course of therapy .
okay . you--
don &apos;t speak .
patient suffered aortic transection ,
miraculously repaired by me ,
and then had a post @-@ op inferior m.i.
that led to cardiac arrest .
so i induced hypothermia .
let &apos;s say , hypothetically , that i did not .
what else could i have done ?
don &apos;t answer that .
i could &apos;ve taken him straight to the cath lab .
but , no , i could not have because had
he had heparin after his surgery ,
that would &apos;ve caused his aorta to blow .
and then i &apos;d have to tell the kid that daddy &apos;s a goner
&apos;cause i blew it ?
no . so i was right . right ?
right .
oh , i &apos;m not asking you .
girls , i really , really need your help here , okay ?
i need to know everything that she ingested last night--
every single thing that went into her mouth .
everything ?
kimmy &apos;s studies show that she has a rupture in her abdomen ,
which is bad .
it is very , very bad .
hello ? oh , okay .
who is that ?
holy panty dropper .
can he be our doctor instead ?
uh , doctor . excuse me .
hi . can you help me ?
please .
what &apos;s up ?
yeah , they &apos;re drunk ...
no , we &apos;re not .
and don &apos;t care
that their friend has a serious abdominal injury .
just ignore them .
no , my breasts are sick .
and i was wondering if you had time to give me an exam .
i need one , too .
all right . enough .
your friend could die if you don &apos;t start cooperating .
do you understand that ?
fine . jeez .
chillax .
we pre @-@ partied with lemon drops at ...
o &apos;briens .
then cosmos at bar nouveau ,
tequila shots at kappa sig ...
smoking nipples at brunch--
what ? what--what was that ?
smoking nipple .
sweet , lots of rum , comes out all smoky .
hold on . like , actual smoke or dry ice ?
kimmy !
let &apos;s get her down .
so his wife goes in the box .
but somewhere , there &apos;s another girl .
where ?
that &apos;s what i can &apos;t figure out .
she &apos;s already in the box .
i know , but where ? there &apos;s no room .
like my new apartment .
living with peckwell not everything you hoped it &apos;d be ?
oh , my god . here comes the chain saw .
no , no , no , no , no ! oh ! i can &apos;t watch that .
oh , my god . that &apos;s amazing .
oh , i can &apos;t unsee that .
i can &apos;t watch it .
oh , that was amazing .
i can &apos;t watch it .
aw . someone &apos;s got his bummer face on .
everywhere i turn , she &apos;s there .
oh , so we &apos;ll walk this way .
oh , but i have to go that way .
yeah , but alex &apos;s little broken heart
needs to go the long way .
oh , okay . well , if it &apos;s for alex &apos;s little broken heart .
alex &apos;s little broken heart wishes you both would shut up .
so i &apos;m worried about bailey .
you know she &apos;s mad at all of us .
why is she mad at us ?
the c.d.c. thing .
she &apos;s locked herself in that lab
and will not come out and will not talk to anyone ,
and that &apos;s weird for her .
i &apos;ll talk to bailey .
yeah , see if you can get through to her .
where was i going ?
oh , no .
what happened ?
abdominal compartment syndrome . ross ?
she &apos;s distended and hemorrhaging ,
causing her intra @-@ abdominal pressure to skyrocket .
we have to get her back to the o.r. , stat .
kayla , honey , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m gonna need the two of you to please step out now .
cherise , come on . -
please don &apos;t let her die . please save her .
ma &apos;am .
please step outside . please .
cherise , now . come on .
cherise . i really need you to--
get your hands off of me , danny !
cherise , i &apos;m her husband , okay ?
i know . i get it ! i get it !
you don &apos;t know anything , danny . we &apos;re in love .
which you would &apos;ve figured out by now
if you paid her any attention .
she wanted to leave you , but i told her to stay
till you got your freakin &apos; dream of having a show in vegas .
i didn &apos;t listen to kayla when she said
she was dying in the marriage ,
dying in the stupid costume ,
dying every time you made her get into that stupid box .
okay . we &apos;re on the move .
no , i know what you &apos;re thinking . e.e.g.
i &apos;ve already done one , and he &apos;s not having seizures .
so why hasn &apos;t he woken up ?
yeah . i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;ve asked every doctor in the hospital
for their opinion ,
and no one has any ideas .
oh , my god . you &apos;re right . go global .
bailey , you are a genius .
oh , cristina . how &apos;d it go with bailey ?
so great .
did you get her to talk ?
no . why ?
okay , just remember , bright and sunshiny .
hi , bailey . it &apos;s arizona .
listen , i understand that you &apos;re mad .
but you know , there &apos;s no reason for you to be mad alone .
you can be mad at us .
you can--you can yell and scream and throw things ,
&apos;cause we can take it .
she &apos;s a grown woman
giving us the silent treatment . it &apos;s a cry for help .
or it &apos;s her way of saying &quot; leave me alone . &quot;
fine . you want to give me the silent treatment ?
well , i can give it right back .
oh , come on , bailey . just talk to me .
so ? what &apos;d you find on smoking nipple ?
the restaurant said the drink is made with liquid nitrogen .
damn .
well , it blew out her stomach , so happy birthday , kimmy .
there &apos;s hardly any gastric remnant .
what &apos;s your plan here ? - a roux @-@ en @-@ y
i &apos;m gonna remove the stomach completely
and then reattach the intestine to the esophagus .
i need another surgeon , so i paged bailey .
bailey &apos;s not operating . webber &apos;s taking her cases .
and he &apos;s with dr. grey on that chain saw lady .
that &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll just get an intern .
you &apos;re not doing this with an intern .
i &apos;ll do it with you .
really ?
i don &apos;t get to see a torched @-@ out stomach that often .
i want to scrub in .
jackson ...
i am so sorry about the other day .
just ... blaming you for everything ,
my whole crappy life .
i &apos;m just ...
you know , i &apos;m crazy .
i know .
i know you are .
but you &apos;re about to do a roux @-@ en @-@ y.
i &apos;d say your life &apos;s pretty good right now .
hey , i heard , uh , you guys are going back in . what happened ?
abdominal compartment syndrome .
we need to decompress her abdomen .
okay , obviously , you don &apos;t need me .
by the way , uh , it &apos;s not just me . bailey hates all of us .
not now , torres .
she won &apos;t even turn around when someone comes to the door .
i mean , you &apos;d--you &apos;d probably get her to open it
if it were you , richard .
that &apos;s probably true .
i said not now . scissors .
right away .
no , i &apos;m just saying , you &apos;re probably
the one person who &apos;d get through to her .
no !
i am the one person bailey does not want to see right now .
i hurt her , deeply ,
and i &apos;m not sure i &apos;ll be able to repair it .
so let &apos;s leave it alone .
and let &apos;s focus , please , on saving this woman &apos;s life .
sorry , richard . i &apos;ll come back for the pelvis when you &apos;re done .
mais vous avez tout d &apos;essais pour revillér .
d &apos;accord .
il y a d &apos;autre ... qui ont .
oui . merci .
a bien sur ! biens ? r .
are you still on the phone with france about the coma fix ?
no , i &apos;m booking us a vacation in nice .
you want a facial the first day ?
oui .
pas de tout .
seulment pour les traumatisme canien .
dommage .
merci .
their trial was specific to coma patients with head trauma .
mexico city &apos;s trial focused on
comas triggered by diabetic ketoacidosis , so--
so you have nothing .
ah , good . you &apos;re here . come on in .
uh , don &apos;t you think it &apos;s , uh ,
a little packed in here already ?
moyamoya &apos;s rare .
everybody &apos;s gonna want to see an omental graft .
come on a little closer .
make room .
wilson , step forward . you can &apos;t learn from back there .
thank you , dr. shepherd .
at what point do you lay down the omentum ?
that &apos;s a good question .
um , well , after you expose
enough of the brain to check the blood supply with a doppler ...
which is good .
nice work , karev .
okay , showtime .
here we go .
wow . look at that .
where ?
right there . in the field . do you see it ?
the brain is just so starved for blood ,
if all goes well , in several weeks ,
it &apos;ll suck up all the vessels .
it &apos;s like a vampire .
mm . okay . show &apos;s over .
anyone who &apos;s not needed can , uh , head on out .
so if we &apos;re lucky , in several weeks ,
something may or may not happen .
well , i &apos;m sorry i am boring you , brooks .
wilson , you interested ?
yes .
scrub in . you can help me close up .
nobody likes a dumb trixie , but this surgery is so much fun ,
i kind of love her for burning a hole in her stomach .
metzenbaum , please .
i know .
i know you &apos;re--you &apos;re thinking i &apos;m an awful person .
i was actually admiring your technique .
oh . do not get a big head about it .
you should talk .
fancy plastics fellow
who also happens to own a hospital .
which means i spend half my time in meetings and not the o.r.
you know , i just flew out
a facial reconstruction specialist that ...
i don &apos;t know .
she gets to fly around the world and perform miracles .
you &apos;re holding this place together , jackson .
that &apos;s pretty miraculous .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
so the good news is , the ultrasound revealed
the encephalocele itself contains only fluid ,
no actual brain matter .
so i will resect it ...
and hopefully , this little guy &apos;s looking at
no developmental defects .
amazing .
it &apos;s just luck .
hi , sorry .
arizona , when you have a second , i need help with bailey .
yeah . um , w--oh , hey . hold on . no .
um , this is dr. boswell .
she &apos;s consulting on the sims baby .
hi . dr. callie torres . ortho .
do you mind if i sit in ? you--you see these , like , never .
no , yeah . yeah . please come in .
the more , the merrier .
um , so then i will take a calvarial bone graft
from the ...
parietal skull
and then use it ...
to form the base of the skull .
i mean , you can use synthetics ,
but where i can use his own bone ...
farm local , right , dr. torres ?
after that , it &apos;s really just a standard cleft lip repair ,
which i &apos;m sure you and dr. avery can do in your sleep .
oh , well-- mm .
yeah , but since you &apos;re here ,
uh , we , uh , we could watch and learn .
all right , then .
in that case , i &apos;ll try to show off a little .
i &apos;m a little bit in love with her .
oh , good .
i didn &apos;t miss it .
nope . just in time . i think .
well , it was her idea .
no , you won &apos;t come out of the lab .
you gave us no other choice .
bailey , just hear us out .
yeah , um , avery wants to apologize .
we all want to apologize .
yes , he screwed up . he knows that .
he should &apos;ve had your back more .
derek , go .
yeah , yeah , yeah , you know , you know ,
i would be just as mad as you are .
you &apos;ve seen me mad .
i hang out in the woods
and i drink myself into a stupor .
but the thing i &apos;ve learned from hiding out is , it doesn &apos;t work .
and , bailey , we need you .
this hospital does not work without you .
9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 in the e.r. gotta go .
guess what , lady . this isn &apos;t even your lab .
okay ? we bought it for you .
was it too much ?
yeah .
what &apos;s going on ?
he got into his grandma &apos;s sleeping pills .
unresponsive . b.p. 74 systolic .
okay , let &apos;s get him to trauma room one .
let &apos;s prep for a gastric lavage .
no ! you &apos;re too close to this . i got it .
all right , let &apos;s , uh , start a flumazenil drip , now .
when i woke up from my nap ...
he was on the floor . i couldn &apos;t wake him .
you know what happens now ?
she is legally obligated to contact social services .
it--it was an accident--
he took an overdose , nancy . what were you thinking ?
were you thinking ?
please , he can &apos;t die . oh , god .
he can &apos;t die , too .
he can &apos;t .
is he stable ?
i think so .
we &apos;re still monitoring him .
but we got him in time to administer the flumazenil
to reverse the effects of the zolpidem .
so hopefully , he &apos;ll wake up soon .
okay . listen , about the social services--
i already called them .
the social worker &apos;s on her way .
it &apos;s a gaba agonist .
yeah .
owen , zolpidem is a gaba agonist .
we can reverse the effects .
wait . we want him to wake up .
so why are we giving him sleeping pills ?
uh , zolpidem triggers the gaba pathway ,
causing drowsiness in normal brains .
where the chemical balance has been disturbed ,
studies have shown that the drug can reverse the effect .
this could actually wake him up ?
so how long before we--
all the cases said it took only minutes .
is she gonna be okay ?
um ...
the next 24 hours is gonna be critical .
i &apos;m hoping to see her liver and kidney function improve .
so she &apos;s out of the woods ?
he didn &apos;t say that , danny .
okay , you two , stop it .
stop fighting .
whatever happened , whatever the history ,
you need to get over it .
it &apos;s not important .
she needs you .
you know , i ...
i saw how ...
unhappy she was , and i just ignored it .
she tried to talk to me a couple of times , and i just ...
i just shut it down .
you know , i thought if i could ...
get us better gigs and make some more money
and become more famous ...
that , um ...
maybe she &apos;d love me again .
danny ...
right now we need to be thinking about kayla .
i am .
she doesn &apos;t need me . she needs you .
you ...
you see her . you love her .
you ...
you &apos;re the one who can help her .
alex , come on .
can we at least try and talk to each other ?
i &apos;d like to feel like i don &apos;t have to avoid pediatrics ,
that we could still work together .
so that &apos;s what you &apos;re worried about ,
not being on my service ? nice .
no . that--that &apos;s not--
i &apos;ve done nothing but try and help you .
really ?
because every time you say anything , my life gets worse .
things with jason were perfect--
i &apos;m sorry if your boyfriend &apos;s an idiot
and can &apos;t deal with your past .
but that &apos;s on you .
obviously , you like them like that .
as for me , i &apos;m sick of crazy chicks with problems .
stay out of my business , okay ?
oh , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m out .
give it a good squeeze . squeeze tight .
there you go . there you go .
that &apos;s amazing . her hand &apos;s already stronger .
i can &apos;t believe it .
yeah , and no more t.i.a.s ?
well , ideally , her brain will learn to soak up
the blood she &apos;s been missing .
not right away .
in a few weeks .
i want to go . now ! now ! now !
no . no , no , love . just a few more minutes , okay ?
hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . we &apos;re almost done here .
hey , listen . hey , listen to me .
your sister needs rest today . you want to know why ?
&apos;cause we opened up her head and we put magic inside .
so i &apos;d be nice to her if i were you ,

and help your friend get better ?

but you need to stop it .
it &apos;s childish
and selfish .
you need to stop .
dr. bailey .
it &apos;s an unusually aggressive infection .

the infection came from one doctor ,
and one doctor alone .
she &apos;s been isolated ,
and the infection has been contained .
this is going to be a nightmare .
first patient-- joyce basche--
she didn &apos;t make it .
dr. miranda bailey is a carrier of mrsa usa600 .
the only doctor who touched all three patients ...
did you scrub ?

i just ... wanted to go to sleep .
ethan , you know how dangerous it is
to take medicine that isn &apos;t yours ?
you could &apos;ve died .
never take any pills without a parent &apos;s permission .
i don &apos;t think i have any parents anymore .
hey . hey , that &apos;s ...
that is not true .
your dad is ...
can &apos;t you try something else ?

to wake him up , ethan .
we haven &apos;t given up on him .

it &apos;s gonna be okay .
okay ?
hey , you want to go split a few dozen pitchers ?
yes . yes , i do .
what is up with that ?
i don &apos;t know and i don &apos;t care .
i told her the guy was a douche . whatever .
let &apos;s go .
what did the social worker say ?
uh , she said these were extraordinary circumstances ,
which is why she wouldn &apos;t take ethan into custody .
but , um , i think maybe she should .
nancy , he is okay . you can do this .

a mother or father .
i mean , he needs a home , a place to run ,
and a school .

it &apos;s &apos; cause you &apos;re head of the hospital now , right ?
that &apos;s why you haven &apos;t called me in 11 days .
because i hate myself .
i hate that i know how many days it &apos;s been
since we hung out .
and i hate myself even more for asking you about it ,
like some needy ...
boring , boy @-@ obsessed little girl ...
who i &apos;m not . let &apos;s be clear about that .
but i d--i d-- i do need to know why
it has been 11 days .

i think i figured out where the trapdoor is ,
but i still don &apos;t understand when the switch happens .
you don &apos;t want to know , kid .
trust me . it &apos;ll ruin it .
you made the flight ?
yeah , just barely .
thanks for the call .

as surgeons , we are no stranger
to the breaks and tears in the human body .
in fact , we sacrifice the better part of our 20s ...
learning every possible way to make it whole again .
miranda . open the door .
but there are some wounds a surgeon can &apos;t repair .
not on our own .
it takes a kind of power we just don &apos;t have .
i got on a plane as soon as i heard .

it doesn &apos;t matter .
yeah , it does .
your intern exams are coming up ... s @-@ soon .

and they died .
i operated on them , and they died ...

and a mother and a ... and a teacher .
i knew their families .
and they all died because of me .
now they want me to go back in an o.r.
