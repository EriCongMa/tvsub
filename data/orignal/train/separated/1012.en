Please tell me this isn't gonna
Be another mortgage-fraud case.
What's wrong with mortgage-fraud cases?
They're boring.
You stare at paperwork all day.
You could stare at prison bars all day.
oh,you still playing that card?
makes me smile.
Excuse me.
Get out of the way.
why all the craziness?
I don't know.This can't be good.
Peter,uh,Hughes wants to see you right away.
All right.
So,is this what it looked like when I escaped?
I don't know.I was working important cases.
What's going on?
The bureau's missing an agent.
That isn't good.
Yeah,he's an undercover from the D.C. office.
We lost contact with him 12 hours ago.
What do you think happened?
I don't know.Could be in trouble,could be laying.
We're not sure.
Listen. Listen to me.
We need somebody who understands money.
Excuse me.I have an important case to deal with.
This is agent Mark Costa.
He was posing as a drug trafficker
Looking to clean some dirty cash through this guy
Lao Shen,money launderer out of china.
Costa was working him until last night.
According to his last contact,
Lao was making a pit stop in New York for 72 hours
And after that, he boards a flight to the homeland
And we lose him.
So,why are you telling me this?
Nicholas Halden.
who?
Cut the crap,Neal.
We know he's one of your aliases.
You created him to launder cash through
that Canary Island scam you ran in '04.
Multimillionaire with a penchant for gambling.
Ringing any bells?
I may have heard of him.
Are you willing to offer him full immunity?
Done.I don't give a damn what you did five years ago.
I want to find my agent.
Then what can Nick do to help?
We want you to make contact with lao using this identity.
What do you know about pai gow?
I know it sounds delicious.
It's a chinese version of poker played with dominoes.
Not really my game.
Make it your game.
Lao likes to contact new clients
using certain hands or bets.
He'll be playing an underground table
In chinatown tomorrow night.
I'm not gonna lie to you
This is a dangerous one, Caffrey.
High stakes.
I'm in.
I asked you to teach me the game. This movie is terrible.
Wait.
Let's take this to the next level.
You took it to the next level when you killed my family.
Your wager,then.
100 grand?
How did he know about Nick Halden?
Surely you can't believe they knew about him.
Steve was a good man.
Steve is a good man.
Besides,you should be more concerned
with what the guy with the ring wants.
I don't know.
I've stolen a lot of stuff in my lifetime.
Maybe Poe's "Tamerlane" book?
No, no. Sold that a while back.
The Tamayo painting.
Not worth all this.
Washington's love letters.
Seriously, I don't even know why you
Stole that in the first place.
Martha
It's my favorite part.
Too rich for your blood,Lee-Kang?
I believe it is your blood that
will make me rich... Farmer boy.
Okay, what are they doing right now?
Oh, they're drawing from the wood pile.
With these tiles, they make two hands.
oh,wait! wait!
He just played the death tile.
Death tile?
W-well,the movie takes a few liberties.
Then why are we watching it?
It's a cult classic!
Okay,fine.What do you have to do?
Fold above the bank.
If I get a better hand than the dealer and
Then throw it away, Lao knows I'm a prospect.
Okay.
Well... Ideally,you want something like this.
This is some of the best tiles you can get.
You trash a hand like this,
And you're in.
It's like folding pocket aces.
All right. Then let's practice.
All you have to do is lose.
You want to practice losing?
No, I have to win first,then lose.
I thought perhaps you gentlemen
Might like something to eat.
oh,thank you,June.
thanks,June.
What are you watching?
"Tiles of Fire."
Part 1?
Part 2's up next.
Don't start without me.
There's a sequel?
Five.
Good news. We've put word out Nicholas Halden
Is in town and looking to do business.
Lao's people took the bait.
We're sending you in as an investor
To his money-laundering scheme.
Lao's game takes place just off of Mott street,
which means we'll be setting up around the corner.
At Meishilin restaurant?
Been there. Good dumplings.
And an even better H.Q. For our purposes.
Family that owns the place are trusted C.I.S for the bureau.
They've had dealings with Lao in the past.
We'll monitor the game from the second floor.
Look...There's an agent missing in all this.
So everyone stay sharp.
The FBI is truly grateful for your help, Mr.Tuan.
I just want Lao out of the neighborhood.
He's been taking from my business for years.
And with my own debt piling up,
I can hardly afford to be in his.
I understand.
Look... I, too, am grateful for your help.
Come on.
Those standard FBI issue?
They were a gift from Elizabeth.
One that keeps on giving.
We tried to make room.
It's perfect.
Apologies.
My daughter, Bai.
Uh...Hi, there.
I'm gonna need that back, okay?
There. Thank you.
Who are you?
What do you mean? The kid just grabbed the
Do you have a business card?
Do you have a business.
It's okay. It's okay. Ready? Watch this.
Ready? One...Two...Three!
Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Where'd it go?
Is it right here? Is it right there?
How silly. Here you go.
Xie xie.
You know, every time I see you do that
I check for my wallet.
All right.
Let's get you suited up.
Game starts in 10.
You reviewed the building layout?
Camera surveillance, electronic passcode.
It's standard stuff.
Any questions?
Just one.
Where did Elizabeth buy those socks?
Cause christmas is coming up soon.
Enough.
There is one small problem.
What?
That's a really nice fake.
It's more concerned with telling us
where you are than telling time.
We deactivated your anklet 30 seconds ago.
Lauren, if you'll do the honors.
Be gentle.
Yeah, never really been the gentle type.
All right. There's a GSM transmitter inside.
It's one-way, but we'll be able
to hear everything that happens.
Everything?
Lao is dangerous, Neal.
We are pulling you the first sign of trouble.
I'll be fine. As long as I don't draw the death tile.
There's a death tile?
Halden.
Nick Halden.
Halden's golden.
He got through.
What happened here?
Lao.
He was in your home?
No, his men.
They came in one night to make sure I would pay.
With a gun.
They fired a bullet 2 inches from my baby's crib
While Bai was still sleeping in it.
How you doing?
Don't get 'em wet, don't feed 'em after midnight, right?
Never mind.
Yung sing.
It's a toast -- drink and win.
Yung sing.
One down... One to go.
8 and 7. Nice hand.
I'm out.
You could have won.
I have more important things than winning.
You folded on a good hand, Mr...?
You know who I am.
And you know why I'm here.
For a man of your reputation, Mr. Halden,
It took some time for you to find the hand you needed.
Pai Gow isn't my game.
What is your game?
Perhaps we should discuss that in private.
We have time for that.
Another hand?
Don't rush him, Neal.
I'm always in for one more game.
Good. Good.
Peter, we got a problem.
NYPD got a tip-off. They're about to raid the game.
who the hell tipped them off?
I have no clue.
They're gonna get neal killed.
You get me captain Shattuck of NYPD
before they crash this whole thing.
Cops!
They're not with me.
I don't believe in coincidence.
Maybe you should.
NYPD, stay where you are.
Lao, let's go.
Just go, go, go.
Put your hands on the table!
Everyone down! down! freeze! We will shoot.
Freeze!
Come on, Neal. Just give yourself up.
Tell them you're FBI.
Fired. Shots fired.
We have a white male, 6-foot, gray suit
Heading out of the building.
I don't think he gave himself up.
Maybe it's not him.
Trying to save my cover here, guys.
It's him. All right.
If he's not with me in three minutes,
You mobilize backup
And tell NYPD to stay the hell out of our way!
And where are my damn shoes?!
I'm getting a little tired of being chased, Peter.
Call the cops off me.
Where is he, Jones?
He's moving north on Allen.
It's okay.
Lao says to let me handle it.
Have I thanked you for that drink?
No.
Remind me to.
Lao knows why you folded back there.
He respects it.
Come with me, and you can complete your business.
Is he gonna point any more guns at me?
You'll be fine. Trust me.
Then lead the way.
You getting this, Peter?
He's trying to save the operation.
Looks like they're heading to a hotel of Mulberry.
If Caffrey doesn't leave Chinatown, then neither do we.
Jones, I want two of our guys positioned in the front
And rear of the place.
Once that's settled,
Find out what the hell happened back there.
Get the NYPD call log, for starters.
I'm not buying this coincidence at all.
Who is this girl?
That's what you're gonna find out.
Where do you want me to start?
Plenty of traffic CAMS in the area.
Have NYPD pull a photo from one of those.
Another all-nighter?
I married a perceptive woman.
And I married a predictable man.
All right. So no dinner tonight.
How about lunch tomorrow?
That sounds great.
What did Neal do now?
Nothing... Yet.
You know, I wouldn't worry too much about him.
He respects you, you know.
I think you're overselling our bond a little bit.
I don't.
Good luck.
Nice place.
When will Lao be joining us?
He won't be.
Then what are we doing here?
He told me to stay the night with you.
There's only one bed.
I wasn't planning on sleeping. Were you?
Let me get you a drink.
Only Caffrey.
Already seen this one on Cinemax.
I haven't.
Lao says I should keep an eye on you
Until we can arrange another meeting.
So, what do we do until then?
Relax?
Have a drink?
I'm good for now.
It's not drugged or poisoned.
Why don't you just relax?
Let's start with this.
What are you doing?
Taking you off the clock.
What happened?
We just lost his transmitter.
Should we go in?
No. We've got guys on the entrances.
We can track Caffrey if he leaves the room.
Assuming he leaves the room.
Hey, that was an expensive...- Fake?
I am really tired of guns being pointed at me tonight.
Nicholas Halden isn't the kind of man
Who would wear a fake watch.
Neal Caffrey,on the other hand...
You know who I am?
You've been on our watch list for years.
Could you be more specific?
Cause I've been on so many, it's kind of hard to keep track.
Interpol.
You know my name, but I don't know yours.
My name is Meilin.
Why is interpol interfering in an FBI investigation?
It's the other way around.
You called the cops.
And you screwed everything up
By impressing Lao with your fancy table tricks.
Now I'm stuck with you.
Well, am I such a bad guy to be stuck with?
If you take Lao, we'll never get to his boss.
He's a much bigger fish.
Yeah,I get it. Turf war. So, why are we here?
You're gonna let Lao walk.
Yeah,I don't know if you heard,
But the Bureau and I are kind of pals lately.
I can't flip on them.
You can botch the deal.
Besides, if you help me,
I'll make sure you get the one thing you want most.
What, a new watch?
Kate.
What do you know about Kate?
I know where she is.
I can help you with that.
I think I'll take that drink now.
Oh, damn.
Oh, I told you to wake me if I drifted off.
Oh, come on, boss. You needed a break.
Anything happen?
Nope.
How long have I been out?
Uh, about a half an hour.
Okay.
Get some rest. I'll take over.
Okay.
What happened to my sock?
I don't know. I was watching the monitor, remember?
Did you steal my sock?
You're a little klepto, aren't you?
You have no idea what I'm saying, do you?
No. Keep that up, you'll end up like Neal.
You don't want that. Trust me.
He's unreliable.
He never listens to you.
And he always gets himself into trouble.
I mean, it's not like I'm worried about him.
I just feel responsible.
Anything happens to him,
I'll have a lot of paperwork to fill out.
Paperwork's a hassle.
Neal's a hassle.
But then again, that was a neat card trick, huh?
Nice to know I'm appreciated.
I knew you were there.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You also know she speaks perfect English?
You're weird.
I want my sock back.
You're a bad influence.
How'd you get here?
I, uh, caught a lift with one of the G-Men
you put in front of the hotel.
I told those guys to call me if they saw you.
No, I told them not to bother you.
You get a little cranky if you don't get your beauty sleep.
What happened to the watch?
I must have banged it up during the chase.
When did it cut out?
While you were in the hotel room.
Oh, that's too bad.
Guess you missed all the good stuff.
So, can she make the meet happen?
She'll contact me with the time and place.
Good. Jones, if you'll do the honors.
Uh, NYPD traced their tip-off on the game to
a cellphone registered to a Ms. Meilin Wang.
It's the same girl Caffrey had a sleepover with last night.
Are you sure about that?
Yeah.
That's from a traffic cam about a block away
at the exact same time the call was placed.
Uh, carrier company lists a hostess bar
on canal as her place of business.
I want to check it out.
I'm curious why Ms. Meilin wants
to call the cops on Lao's game --
Especially if she wants to keep your deal alive.
You got a problem with that?
Let's go.
Looks like our employees are on break right now.
Any thoughts on how to approach this one? No?
Isn't this the part where you say,
"we should buy them a drink"?
I can't go in there. It'll blow my cover.
Guess I'll have to show you how it's done.
Hello.
Agent Burke, FBI.
I want to ask you a few questions about
One of your co-workers -- Ms. Meilin Wang.
Uh, one at... one at... one at a time, please.
Could...does anyone ...does anyone
know where she is right now?
Oh, really? Do you know where she lives?
That's the same guy who caught me, right?
That's the guy who caught you twice.
Does anyone speak English? Anyone?
No. O-okay. All right.
All right, thank you. Thanks very much.
So that's how it's done?
Yeah, that's how it's done.
Amazing what someone will say when they don't think
That you can speak their language, isn't it?
Have a translator meet us at the office.
Let's see what they were saying
Behind the back of the bumbling FBI agent.
Where's the translator?
Won't be here for another hour.
Oh, damn it.
All right, let her run.
Maybe we can pick up a name, at the very least.
Meilin Wang. What?
Meilin Wang. Oh, really? Did you...
Catch anything?
Not so much.
Where are subtitles when you need them?
Someone called you a bad name.
There you are. Sorry about that.
We're, uh, taking Victor's statement, and
I guess she heard your voice.
All right, let's go.
Hold on.
I got an idea.
These ladies are mean.
They think you're stupid.
Leave that out.
Something about Meilin working
a night shift a place called Red Lantern.
Where do I know that from?
Well, it could be a club or a restaurant.
Could be a sunburnt superhero.
It's a waste, Peter.
Following Meilin's not getting us
any closer to Lao or Costa.
Found it. Red Lantern exports.
It looks like Costa suspected
It was a shell company for Lao.
That's what he was looking into before he disappeared.
So she had a part-time job at a warehouse.
That's an eclectic rum?
Still wasting our time?
Jones, look up that address for me.
So, the results on Meilin's facial scan came back.
You got anything?
Nothing...
Because it came back restricted.
Restricted?
Which means she's either a C.I.
Or working for another organization.
Run it through the interagency database.
Already did.
She's interpol.
Wow, you think Neal knows?
Well, he spent six hours alone
with her in a room -- he knows.
Maybe he was keeping his cover.
Okay. He knows.
He's playing me.
Well... There's really only one reason
why he would keep something from you.
Just one?
Kate.
What are you gonna do?
Pick that for me.
Don't we need a warrant?
Oh, look at you. A law-abiding citizen all of a sudden.
I got goose bumps.
Agent Costa already filed for one.
I don't have my tools.
Well, I got mine.
I think I just saw the ark of the covenant back there.
If my face melts, let me know.
Neal.
Sign of a struggle.
Scuff marks.
Looks like someone was dragged right down that way.
Blood.
It's agent Costa.
Lao's men.
I didn't see an alarm system.
They're not here for us.
Then who?
Costa.
Oh, come on. No service.
No, no! What are you...
You got a better idea?
I let them walk right out the door!
Oh, would you rather be dead?
This isn't a game, Neal.
I think it's time you and I had a little heart-to-heart.
About what?
Your friend at interpol.
Look, I never lied to Peter.
You did leave a few things out.
You don't understand.
I need to find Kate.
She's in danger.
Look, my husband really wants to trust you,
But you keep giving him reasons not to.
You're on your own on this one.
No! Please stay! Don't go!
So, what now?
Now I wouldn't take you off this case if I could.
I wasn't talking about the case.
What did interpol promise you?
Did Meilin promise you Kate?
Look, what was I supposed to do?
She said she could find her.
In exchange for what?
They want Lao to walk.
Do you know why?
They're after his boss.
Lao doesn't have a boss.
You know what this is really about?
It's about jurisdiction.
If they arrest him on Asian soil,
They get additional funding from China's government.
Additional funding?
Yeah.
Half a million dollars
That's the price of a dead FBI agent.
You really think you can believe everything she tells you?
We either take down Lao now,
Or our partnership comes to an end.
We're partners?
You tell me.
Hello, Neal, dear.
I was just having a charming conversation with your friend.
It has been wonderful to meet you.
Likewise, June.
Now that I know you're such a wonderful host
Don't be surprised if I stop by again soon.
I'd keep my eye on that one.
What happened to Costa?
What, no small talk?
I saw a dead FBI agent today.
Not really feeling like small talk.
I'm the reason you found that body.
You expect me to believe you
Left a bread-crumb trail on purpose?
Your agent deserved a proper burial.
Well, he didn't get one.
Was his cover blown?
Lao suspected he was working for
A competitor, not a government.
You don't believe me.
I have pretty good reason not to.
You lied to me about why you want Lao.
And?
And you're letting a murderer go
Free to curry political favor.
If that sits right with you,
Then maybe I should rethink our arrangement.
I'm just doing my job.
And right now, my job is to make sure the FBI
Can't monitor any of Lao's accounts
During your meeting tomorrow.
Doesn't matter to me what happens after that.
Neal?
The man who's got Kate... I know who it is.
Anklet off.
And you'd better not break this one.
When they scan you for bugs,
Manually deactivate the transmitter.
Press it again, it turns it back on,
And you damn well better turn it back on.
I will, Peter.
Once you give Lao our account number,
We'll be able to scan the dirty money.
Between that and the audio from the watch,
We'll be able to put this guy away for good.
Anything else?
Yeah.
Good luck in there.
Do you have the account number?
And you're ready for this?
Ready.
He cut the signal.
What's important is when he turns it back on.
Keep an eye on the bank account.
I'm gonna give you a new account number to use
one the FBI can't trace.
131278871.
Got it? Repeat it to me.
I got it.
Relax, Neal.
It's almost over.
I apologize for the scene the other night.
As you know, you can never be too careful.
Oh, I completely understand.
I think you'll find this to be the beginning of
a very rewarding relationship for both of us.
I hope so.
Meilin speaks very highly of you, Mr.Halden.
The account number, if you please.
131278871.
Any movement on the account?
Nothing.
Come on, Neal.
And just like that, we are partners.
We'll contact you in two weeks
With your money, minus the 10% fee, of course.
Of course.
All right, I did what you wanted. Now tell me who has Kate.
It's all in there.
Hey, Lao.
We never got to finish our game.
I'll make it worth your while...an extra 10% if you win.
Very well.
Come.
Lose your money.
What are you doing?
Oh, I already transferred the money from your account.
Doesn't matter what happens now, right?
One more hand and I'll have all of your money.
Are you certain you want to go again?
Just to keep things interesting...My watch for yours.
Come on, Lao.
What's life without a little risk?
Why not?
The signal's back.
What is that?
That sounds like dominoes.
You look worried.
Do I?
Yung sing.
Yung sing.
Some days, the tiles don't fall the way we want.
Some days they do.
At least I lost my watch to a worthy adversary.
It appears luck was not on your side today.
The strange thing...
Even though my profits are one hundredfold in business,
A victory with the tiles is supremely more satisfying.
The American had no talent.
They rarely do.
The outstanding parcels have been delivered.
And the body?
Disposed of, sir.
Good.
A Dirty business. It will be a relief to be home.
Anything good on the radio?
We got him.
He'll be gone for a long time.
Lao may as well have confessed in front of a grand jury
With the hours of transcript we have on him.
I just want to thank you and let you
Know that you are welcome here anytime.
Neighborhood's better off without Lao.
You know I think these are the best dumpling I've ever had.
I'll get you some more.
So, are you gonna tell me what was on that flash drive?
You were right.
It was empty.
Oh, no.
Close your eyes.
Why?
Would you just close them?
Open.
David Copperfield she ain't.
Xie-xie ni.
What's next, partner?
Don't call me that.
Yeah?
Hello, Meal.
You calling to apologize about the empty flash drive?
That was a necessary precaution.
I had to be careful with something this sensitive.
So you know who has Kate?
I don't have a name, but I know this -- he's FBI.
*Take me away from here*
How do you know?
How do you know that?
Like the morning after the rain
You know I worry all the time
What's coming around the bend
Maybe I'm just going crazy
*But it feels like*
It feels like
It feels like,it feels like,it feels like
It feels like the end
So do I. I want the man who's got her.
