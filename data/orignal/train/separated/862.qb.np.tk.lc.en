in the &apos; 80s , a defining moment
for every teenage boys was seeing &quot; the karate kid . &quot;
it kicked and punched and swept the
leg of our hearts .
no one loved it more than my brother barry .
come at me !
high block ! cobra strike !
fake left , go right . ninja roll !
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m okay .
now throw a chop !
i block that chop !
i retaliate ! high kick ! fist of fury !
death blow !
hmm , you know , i was thinking--
it might be better if you didn &apos;t call out your moves first .
that &apos;s a great idea .
sneak attack !
sure , my big bro had an inflated sense of skill ,
but in my house , my mother was the one who did the inflating .
she wore something we called &quot; mom goggles . &quot;
they made everything we did
not just good , but spectacular .
oh , look at you , my little kung fu master !
it &apos;s not kung fu . stop !
i do kara @-@ te .
bilingual and dangerous ?
oh , you are just off @-@ the @-@ charts amazing , honey .
most kids ignore their mom &apos;s high praise ...
but barry wasn &apos;t most kids .
he really believed the hype .
unfortunately , that confidence did not translate
to his moves with the ladies .
hi ?
yo .
locker strike !
are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine . my hands are like rocks .
but they &apos;re soft , too . and gentle .
like baby ducks .
weird .
all right , kids !
that time of year again .
holiday talent show . eh ?
nobody ?
oh , my god , i love the talent show .
oh , do ya now ?
do ya now ?
weird .
you &apos;re great .
see ya later .
barry had a plan in motion ,
and that night , he put it into action .
good evening .
glad you could all make it tonight .
what--what is this ?
big announcement .
i &apos;ve decided to do a kara @-@ teroutine
at the school talent show .
auditions are tomorrow .
now i don &apos;t want to make too big a deal out of this ,
but i do believe it will be the greatest moment
in the history of everything .
oh , my goodness ! what a wonderful idea !
murray , isn &apos;t this a wonderful idea ?
if i say yes , can i be out of the conversation ?
what about you , erica ?
you should absolutely do this talent thing .
i &apos;ve heard you singing pat benetton in the shower .
don &apos;t worry , guys . i &apos;ll be at the talent show--
in the front row .
&apos;cause my friends and i always go for a good laugh .
go ahead ! bring all your hot friends .
i &apos;ll wow &apos; em with my moves .
now , adam , chuck a dinner roll at my face .
watch me deflect it . come on .
no . no . not like that . gentle .
and don &apos;t hit me in the face if you can--
no--what are doing ? !
gently .
let me get ready , okay ? come on .
stop it !
yes !
what the hell ?
like lightning ! i &apos;m like lightning !
i knew you could do it ! i knew you could do it !
it was december 9th , 1980 @-@ something ,
and barry &apos;s holiday cheer was nowhere in sight .
what &apos;s the point of anything ? !
whoa , whoa , whoa . slow down . what &apos;s wrong ?
i didn &apos;t get into the talent show .
i don &apos;t understand .
they rejected me .
that literally makes no sense .
everyone who auditioned got in but me .
i hear what you &apos;re saying ,
but i cannot wrap my mind around that .
mr. glascott said my routine was too inappropriate .
how is being a perfect kara @-@ te angel inappropriate ?
barry ! okay , i have been thinking .
your kara @-@ te routine--
it needs a professional director .
that &apos;s me ! a big idea guy .
plus , i &apos;ve seen a million karate movies .
are you crying ?
no . no !
they &apos;re warrior &apos;s tears , and it doesn &apos;t matter !
the school said no !
i &apos;ll never cobra strike again !
this isn &apos;t fair !
at that moment , there was only one thing
running through my mom &apos;s mind .
no one tells my baby he can &apos;t cobra strike .
mr. glascott !
i need to speak to you immediately .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i have an important morning meeting
with the kids from the math club .
the nerds can wait .
my son--barry goldberg--cannot .
are you ... beverly goldberg ?
oh , yes , i am .
tell me , what kind of educator
stomps on the dreams of his students ?
look , barry &apos;s a good kid ,
which is kinda why i discouraged him
from taking part in the show .
see , some of the more high @-@ profile students here
can be very critical , if you follow me .
i really don &apos;t .
the popular kids here are real douche @-@ sacks .
last year , one kid did a lovely ventriloquist act .
the kids--well , they did unspeakable things
to that doll after the show .
quite frankly , it was very jarring .
and barry &apos;s karate is really ripe
for that type of ridicule .
uh , this is high school , not &quot; star search . &quot;
i mean , who died and made you ed mcmahon ?
mr. johansson . our gym teacher .
he died .
yeah , it doesn &apos;t matter . barry is doing that show .
i will go to the top on this .
i &apos;ll petition the principal , the school board ,
the superintendent , the mayor &apos;s office ,
the u.s. secretary of education if i have to .
so what &apos;s it gonna be , andre ?
you know my name .
i know everything .
i got into the talent show !
that &apos;s good news , and very surprising to me .
mr. glascott said the tri @-@ state talent show committee
met and ruled that kara @-@ te is an art form .
wow , the tri @-@ state talent show committee met .
you know , that &apos;s almost unbelievable !
well , it happened , so let &apos;s just move on .
oh , man , we &apos;re back in business !
let &apos;s get to work !
i &apos;ll go get my nunchucks and firecrackers .
no firecrackers !
so ... you threatened a teacher ?
please . i just gently suggested
that he do what i say ,
or there &apos;d be dire consequences .
why is it you go trotting down to the school
and yell at somebody every time one of our kids
doesn &apos;t get their way ?
i &apos;m involved . that &apos;s a good thing .
you are out of control !
i had no choice , murray .
have you even seen barry do kara @-@ te ?
it &apos;s like a beautiful ballet ,
but with punching and grunting and rolling around .
he quit after eight lessons
because he didn &apos;t want to bike the six blocks to get there .
it hardly makes him chuck norris .
oh , really ? barry , get in here .
what ?
your father would like a sneak peek
of your routine before the big show .
adam , get the firecrackers .
no firecrackers !
no firecrackers .
dragon stance ! kee @-@ ya !
tiger claw ! kee @-@ ya !
sumo tomahawk chop !
kee @-@ ya !
assistant . present weaponry .
nunchucks !
nunchucks .
that &apos;s okay . i &apos;m okay .
bo staff !
sorry .
and now ...
the most deadly weapon of &apos; em all--my hands .
oh , no ! a robber !
don &apos;t worry , kelly lebrock , i &apos;ll save you !
no--oh-- don &apos;t !
you &apos;re not supposed to hit me .
disarm ! adam !
jeez , you &apos;re supposed to disarm .
you &apos;re supposed to let go !
he has been disarmed !
and now ... the big finish .
damn !
that &apos;ll break during the show .
that was the greatest thing
my eyeballs have ever , ever seen !
do you want me to go again ?
yes !
we &apos;re going again !
turns out , not everyone had mom goggles .
do it again ! do it again !
the talent show was the furthest thing
from erica &apos;s mind , but pops was hoping to change that .
hey , kiddo , mind if i sit down ?
i know what you &apos;re gonna say ,
and i &apos;m not doing the talent show .
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
i came to ... borrow this magazine .
&quot; eight ways to catch a hunk . &quot;
what is this garbage ?
but since you brought it up--
pops , forget it !
doing the talent show is social suicide .
i might as well go up on stage
with a sign that says , &quot; i have lice . &quot;
that doesn &apos;t sound like much of an act .
come on , you have an amazing voice ,
a @-@ and you &apos;re terrific on the guitar .
you got to play the guitar .
can &apos;t . sold it .
what ? ! you loved that guitar .
and now i love my leather jacket .
that is very angering .
look , i appreciate you believing in me
and all that crap , but there &apos;s no chance
i &apos;m gonna do the talent show .
oh , there &apos;s a chance ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna get you to do it .
uh , not gonna happen !
we &apos;ll see !
waste of time !
can &apos;t hear you !
good morning , bar . nice karate pajamas .
it &apos;s called a gi .
you need to educate yourself , man . see more movies .
listen , i know your mom loves this whole hong kong fooey act ,
but ... haven &apos;t you considered doing something else ?
why would i ever do that ?
because you &apos;re barry goldberg ,
a man of many different talents .
it &apos;s true . i am great at a lot of stuff .
skateboarding , rapping , breakdancing .
a little ...
pop @-@ and @-@ lock action .
why are we even having this conversation ?
i &apos;m going kara @-@ te .
the committee ruled in my favor .
barry , you can &apos;t do this act . i speak from experience .
what are you talking about ?
when i was your age ,
i was the funniest guy on the football team .
funny ? since when are you funny ?
i &apos;m plenty funny , okay ?
i was hilarious .
i used to tell dirty jokes ,
i &apos;d snap guys with a towel .
i gave everybody a nickname ,
like , uh , pretty boy and shorty .
those are terrible nicknames .
shorty wasn &apos;t short .
as a matter of fact , he was a giant .
oh , my god . had a gland problem .
actually sad stuff .
what &apos;s the point to this ?
the point is ,
the coach said , &quot; murray , you &apos;re a card .
why don &apos;t you host the pep rally ? &quot;
so i did .
i get up there , i realize
i &apos;ve only got one minute of material .
one minute !
i bombed in front of the whole school .
they threw peaches at me .
why &apos;d they have peaches ?
i don &apos;t know ! they weren &apos;t even in season !
all i know is , i don &apos;t want you to go through
what i went through .
please don &apos;t do your act . i &apos;m begging you !
so you think i &apos;m gonna suck ?
no , son .
i know you &apos;re going to suck .
well , i got news for you .
the audience won &apos;t throw peaches .
they &apos;ll throw flowers .
and cheers ! and boobs !
naked boobs ! everywhere !
just you watch . watch !
boobs ! naked !
in that moment , my dad realized
he only had one way to protect barry .
he was gonna stand up for his son
by standing in his way .
mr. glascott ?
we need to talk .
i &apos;m out again !
what ? !
mr. glascott said the natial talent show committee
overruled the tri @-@ state talent show committee .
well , this is very surprising
and unacceptable , but they have made their ruling ,
and i believe we should honor it .
the talent show committee system in this country &apos;s broken !
national committee , huh ?
well , it &apos;s more powerful than the tri @-@ state committee .
what can i say ?
this is unbelievable .
you trotted down to that school
after being so judgy with me about it ?
hey , i &apos;m just being an involved parent .
you told me that was a good thing .
not when you do it . you got your own son
kicked out of a talent show . who does that ?
look , i &apos;m doing the kid a favor
by not wearing mom goggles all the time .
mom what ?
goggles !
we all know you wear &apos; em !
it makes you think our kids are so brilliant
and perfect and poop rainbows .
for once , just take those mom goggles off
and admit that our wonderful children
are terrible at so many different things .
i will not .
they &apos;re gonna have plenty of people
trying to tear them down in life ,
so while they &apos;re under my roof ,
the least i can do is try to build them up .
accept our children &apos;s mediocrity !
it &apos;s freeing !
seriously ? i &apos;m right here !
oh , not--not you . you &apos;re fantastic .
yeah , you &apos;re a real gem yourself .
as the talent show drew near ,
pops thought it was time to pull out his secret weapon .
hello . i ...
i didn &apos;t realize you were here .
me , i &apos;m just sitting here ,
relaxing , strumming the old banjo .
you &apos;re wasting your strums .
am i ? or is it time to do that duet
we used to do ?
won &apos;t you come home , bill bailey ?
pops . pops !
i &apos;m not doing the talent show .
come on ! do this show !
you can even borrow my banjo .
don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but toting a banjo up on stage
isn &apos;t exactly what you &apos;d call cool .
since when is the banjo not cool ?
since the invention of the banjo .
erica , when you were younger , you used to do everything--
volleyball , gymnastics , school chorus .
what happened to you ?
well , i go to high school , where people judge you .
well , if you don &apos;t think the banjo &apos;s cool ,
i can always break out the accordion .
turns out pops wasn &apos;t the only one
still trying to get a goldberg into the talent show .
or out of the talent show .
get out of the way , idiot !
what are you doing here ?
stopping you from doing what you &apos;re doing !
the only thing i &apos;m here to do is ...
fake left , go right .
but isn &apos;t it your responsibility
to encourage talented students--
dad ? !
oh , hey . i @-@ i was just talking to mr. glascott here
about putting erica into the talent show .
i can &apos;t take this anymore .
you want your kids in , they &apos;re in .
oh , great ! which one ?
i don &apos;t know . both of them ? none of them ?
i really don &apos;t care ! i mean ,
it &apos;s a stupid freakin &apos; high school talent show !
i had one moment of weakness
where i tried to do something kind for your son .
i apologize !
all i care about now
is that i owe 20 grand in student loans ,
i live in a studio apartment
above a steaming hot dry cleaner ,
and i have a second job where i work as a pizza man ,
and occasionally i get to deliver pizzas
to my students .
oh , also i have a parrot that i can &apos;t get rid of .
they live for 80 years . did you know that ?
nobody tells you about that .
you have to put them in your will !
it &apos;s a nightmare !
so , yeah , do whatever you want to do ,
&apos;cause i really don &apos;t care !
that made me hungry for pizza .
who wants pizza ?
all right , we &apos;ve gathered you here
because we &apos;ve got some great news .
there &apos;s been some movement on the talent show .
again ? this has been an emotional roller coaster .
turns out barry can do the show !
or not , if you don &apos;t want to .
what are you talking about ?
the national talent show committee already ruled .
it &apos;s binding .
actually , um ...
we &apos;re the committees .
what ?
your mother took it upon herself
to trot on down to the high school
and yell at mr. glascott
when you didn &apos;t get into the talent show .
what ? !
your father trotted , too .
at least i was trying to get him into the show .
unbelievable ! why is anyone trotting anywhere ? !
the silver lining ? erica &apos;s in the show , too .
excuse me ?
i talked to mr. glascott . troubled man .
but i told him all about you .
well , you can tell him something else .
i &apos;m not doing that show .
me , too !
&apos;cause mom meddled , i &apos;m not doing that show anymore !
and &apos; cause dad doesn &apos;t believe in me ,
i &apos;m gonna prove you wrong , and i &apos;m gonna do the show .
wait . wh @-@ which one is it ?
i don &apos;t know !
i &apos;m just so angry at both of you .
i really think you should do it .
all right . i spoke with adam .
this thing matters a lot to a lot of people .
i &apos;m back in .
the talent show was back on ,
and so was my directorial debut !
it was only the opening act
of the william penn academy holiday talent show ,
and barry was already getting cold feet .
they &apos;re really good .
it &apos;s gonna be a tough act to follow .
what are you worried about ? you got a black belt .
that i took from dad &apos;s bathrobe !
dorks !
in that moment , barry realized
the reason why lexy bloom loved the talent show .
like the rest of the cool crowd ,
she could bag on all the idiots on stage .
i can &apos;t go out there !
what ? !
i can &apos;t do it ! dad was right .
i &apos;m gonna humiliate myself .
they &apos;re gonna throw peaches at me !
peaches ? who has peaches ? what are you talking about ?
i can &apos;t do it !
despite pops &apos; best efforts ,
erica decided to not even go to the talent show .
but our grandfather had one more card to play .
and that was our second @-@ to @-@ last act ,
ellen mcrae juggling !
all right , karate kid , you &apos;re up next .
i can &apos;t go out there .
what are you talking about ? you &apos;re our closer .
we gotta have a closer .
or i could just end it .
well , i &apos;m out .
i &apos;m in .
my grandfather said you might have a spot open for me .
well , seeing as i don &apos;t care at all , yes .
one of the goldbergs .
so , um ...
this is a song i sing in the shower .
just get it over with , i guess .
oh , you &apos;re a real tough cookie with the long history
of breakin &apos; little hearts like the one in me
that &apos;s okay , let &apos;s see how you do it
put up your dukes , let &apos;s get down to it
hit me with your best shot
why don &apos;t you hit me with your best shot ?
oh , hit me with your best shot
fire away
you come on with your &quot; come on &quot;
you don &apos;t fight fair
but that &apos;s okay , just see if i care
knock me down , it &apos;s all in vain
i &apos;ll get back up on my feet again
hit me with your best shot
why don &apos;t you hit me with your best shot ?
oh , hit me with your best shot
fire away
i &apos;m back in !
still don &apos;t care .
you &apos;re a real tough cookie with the long history
of breakin &apos; little hearts
like the one in me
that &apos;s okay , let &apos;s see how you do it
put up your dukes , let &apos;s get down to it
hit me with your best shot
sneak attack !
why don &apos;t you hit me with your best shot ?
hit me with your best shot
fire away
my babies !
hit me with your best shot
why don &apos;t you hit me with your best shot ?
hit me with your best shot
you can do it , baby !
pops was right .
erica had nothing to be embarrassed about .
in fact , in that moment , it felt damn good
to be a goldberg .
i have the most talented kids in the world !
more talented than yours ! more talented than yours !
calm down . calm down .
oh , my god !
especially for my dad , who put on the mom goggles ...
for the first time in his life .
yeah ! yeah ...
thank you , guys .
and as for me , i did what any good director would do--
i made my star look good .
kee @-@ ya .
i switched barry &apos;s board for balsa wood .
okay , mom . next talent show &apos;s only a year away .
can &apos;t start preparing too early ! show me what you got .
i wrote a smooth soul jam .
you ready ?
girl
i want to get with you
big tasty wants to get with you
you got to , mmm , back it up
mmm , back it up
i &apos;m sorry , was that barry goldberg ,
or barry manilow ? &apos; cause i can &apos;t tell the difference !
