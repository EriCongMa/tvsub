alaric &apos;s babies-- they &apos;re inside of you .
i know they &apos;re not mine . they &apos;re still my responsibility .
the phoenix stone gives the sword its power
against immortal foes .
when a vampire is stabbed through the heart ,
the sword acts as a magical conduit ,
transferring their spirit into this nasty stone ,
creating your own little personal hell .
stefan !
stefan !
hi there , hero . you &apos;ve been out a long time .
the spell &apos;s not working .
it pulled stefan out , no problem .
how come we had no trouble reuniting your soul with your body ?
because eventually i submitted to the kind of
suffering that just breaks you .
we all do anything we can to avoid that kind of pain .
what did you want ? stop lying to yourself !
i wanted ...
my mother .
i got to get her back . i got to get her back .
damon , you &apos;re safe .
none of this is real !
damon , don &apos;t !
no .
donovan , hey , wake up .
you do not get to die .
donovan , drink .
bon .
bonnie , bonnie .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
i didn &apos;t know where i was .
i didn &apos;t know i was out--
oh , yup .
i saw this coming .
... ababbas dagoineh ... abbabbas dagoineh ...
melunah ... washaset ...
stefan ?
stefan ?
stefan ?
yeah .
yeah , i heard you .
no vervain this time ?
no switching up the menu ?
nah , i just wanted to make sure you had a chance to calm down .
oh , i &apos;m calm .
no , no , no . you &apos;re gonna say to me--
you &apos;re gonna say i screwed up so bad ,
i nearly killed all of our friends
because i thought i was stuck in a fake hell @-@ world .
you don &apos;t have to explain .
it wasn &apos;t your fault .
it was an honest mistake .
you &apos;re getting a pass .
wait . you skipped a bunch of stuff .
first i &apos;m supposed to say that i see the error of my ways ,
and then you tell me that that &apos;s not good enough ,
and then you judge me harder .
and then i say something mean but true
that totally throws you off balance .
you came out of the phoenix stone ,
but you thought you were still inside of it .
everybody understands .
that &apos;s pretty generous considering i just
stabbed your pregnant girlfriend in the chest .
yeah . well ...
the hellstone does a number on you .
yeah . yeah , it does .
well , i &apos;m here .
and it &apos;s real .
i &apos;m ready for my bro hug .
that will entail you unchaining me , brother .
here &apos;s the thing , damon , um ,
hell messes with you .
but post @-@ hell is much worse .
you guys got to be kidding me .
this is still my house .
tyler lockwoof .
yeah , stefan , i thought my allergies were acting up .
i didn &apos;t know you were back .
caroline invited me to her baby shower ,
although she failed to mention the part
about mystic falls going to crap .
what the hell happened out there ?
oh , you know , we had to evacuate .
scary heretics ,
fictional mining fires .
you weren &apos;t cc &apos;d on the memo ?
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s talking about the evacuation , damon .
so what is he talking about ?
i know you didn &apos;t manage to screw the whole town up
all over again while i was on my weekend trip to limbo .
that &apos;s the thing .
you weren &apos;t gone for just the weekend .
you &apos;ve been gone for weeks .
ellis , tell your friends to bring something back from their hunt .
we need to stock the bar for happy hour .
no killing dinner .
on my count .
3 , 2 , 1 !
go !
who &apos;s thirsty ? !
what &apos;s wrong ?
damon text @-@ bombing you empty apologies ?
no . i &apos;m letting stefan deal with damon .
oh , that &apos;s smart .
until damon manipulates stefan into thinking he &apos;s changed ,
and then he &apos;s our problem again .
i &apos;m trying to be positive , ok ?
oh , my god .
what ?
are you on matchasingle.com ?
why ?
&apos;cause it just matched us .
oh , you wish , mystic queen .
ok , we got to get you a new profile picture .
is that a gun ?
yeah , i was in my uniform .
i &apos;m not gonna crop my gun out .
ok , i &apos;m not trying to be in your business ,
but maybe showing a softer side will get you more hits .
... femus !
matt .
matt , ok , he &apos;s dead .
at least lily kept her heretics on a leash .
i guess it &apos;s safe to say i lost my soft side .
ok .
come on . let &apos;s get these bodies out of here .
you delegated deputy doolittle
to patrol the streets with his witchy ride @-@ along ?
are you sure bonnie put the right soul back in your body ?
i mean , what happened to your hero @-@ hair campaign
to protect mystic falls ?
well , i &apos;ve been busy trying to raise you from the dead .
it &apos;s called multitasking .
you have no idea what i have been through .
all right , brother ,
you have a captive audience .
what &apos;d i miss ?
thank you .
after bonnie did the spell to bring me out of the stone ,
all i wanted to do is get back to normal with caroline .
super fancy .
even my purse has a chair .
well , we &apos;re celebrating ,
so i figured we &apos;d take it up a notch , right ?
absolutely .
so what wine are you feeling like ?
i don &apos;t care . whatever you want .
well , i &apos;m drinking water .
right .
sorry .
are you sure that you &apos;re up for this ?
i know it &apos;s the first time you &apos;ve really been out
since you woke up .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m fine .
thank you , though .
ok . good .
because bonnie thinks she &apos;s close to pulling damon out .
she said that she felt especially strong today .
and with any luck , we &apos;ll be celebrating something else soon .
hello , lovers .
miss me ?
how &apos;d you get here ?
get away from her !
stefan , stop . what are you doing
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
so you got out of hell , you &apos;re on the up @-@ and @-@ up ,
and then you started hallucinating me as a waiter .
i mean , i couldn &apos;t be a manager or something ?
i think you &apos;re missing the point .
i get the point , stefan .
i have no desire to kill caroline .
i mean , other than the last time i tried .
but we can all agree that that was a huge misunderstanding .
i &apos;m not gonna have a psychotic break , brother .
i promise .
ok .
here &apos;s how this is gonna work .
i &apos;m gonna unchain you .
and you &apos;re not gonna leave my side
until i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re ok .
i &apos;m 100 % ok .
good .
then you can prove it to me
while i drive you around the new mystic falls .
great .
damon ...
peek @-@ a @-@ boo .
ready ?
yeah . all good .
are you really worried about damon
or is this just a convenient excuse to get out of the
baby @-@ food @-@ tasting game ?
well , if that is what i think it is , then i
would rather be sent back to the hellstone .
honestly ,
i don &apos;t blame you .
but alaric needs this .
you know , he doesn &apos;t have the necessary accoutrements
of a single father @-@ to @-@ be .
well , don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m gonna still get him that baby bjorn thing
or whatever you made me click on when i was drunk .
thank you .
hey , be safe today , ok ?
i finally got you back to reality .
i want to keep you in one piece .
don &apos;t you worry . i will . bye .
oh , boy .
what ?
just get inside .
lovely .
yeah . well , you get used to the smell .
and this is why they should &apos;ve gotten me out first .
well , they tried ,
but apparently , you weren &apos;t ready to be pulled out .
what happened to you in there ?
picture me as a soldier in gray
being shot to death over and over and over again
while the ghost of mommie dearest
floated on her harpy wings , saying ,
&quot; i told you so , damon . &quot;
sounds pretty miserable if you ask me .
well , i think that was the point .
i just realized all i had to do was
cry some big boy tears
and tell mommy i was sorry .
glad you got some closure .
it did the trick
because right after that ,
i went toward the red light in the sky .
what about you ?
how &apos;d you pass your existential dealio ?
look who survived .
look who infested my town
because he has nothing better to do with his eternity .
your brother and i called a truce .
well , i wouldn &apos;t call you taking over my town
without my permission a truce exactly .
well , i suppose it wasn &apos;t so much of a takeover
as a walk right in and nobody stopping you .
you gonna take that , hmm ?
today &apos;s all about proving
that you can play well with others , all right ?
there &apos;s no need to pout .
i &apos;m not gonna hurt your precious town .
it holds sentimental value for me as well .
this was lily &apos;s home once . now it &apos;s mine .
well ...
anyway ...
i &apos;m making this about myself
when here you are , back with the living .
congratulations ,
although now &apos;s where the real work begins ,
doesn &apos;t it ?
hey , good luck to you both .
can i get you another one , soldier ?
damon ...
yeah .
hey , what are you looking at ?
one too many pieces of vampire trash .
are you certain you &apos;re still suited to be his wing man ?
i expect you &apos;re still adjusting yourself .
i think i &apos;m handling it .
thanks .
yes .
when i first got out , i thought i was ...
handling it , too .
this is a nightmare .
look at him .
are you kidding me ?
this is the best blackmail material ever .
in t @-@ minus a few short weeks ,
these babies are popping out of me
and being handed over to him ,
their only parent--
a man who &apos;s hardly inspiring any confidence .
time .
yes !
that &apos;s terrifying .
you &apos;re never baby @-@ sitting .
neither of you ... ever .
i made a helmet .
how did you do that ?
well , it &apos;s a diaper , not a bomb ,
though i could dismantle a bomb blindfolded if i needed to .
there &apos;s nothing funnier than newborns and c4 .
so i shouldn &apos;t store my explosives in the nursery ?
i think i read that in one of the 20 parenting
magazines you left in my office .
ok , ok ! i get it .
i &apos;m the overprotective , no @-@ fun surrogate .
no . no . actually , you are
an incredibly generous friend , who i will forever be indebted to .
well , it &apos;s not about debt .
as long as you understand
once these babies are born ,
i will not be on call 24 / 7
to burp and bathe and feed
and diaper and ...
i get it , caroline .
i--i don &apos;t expect that to be your problem .
well , it &apos;s not a problem .
it &apos;s just that there &apos;s--oof .
baby a just kicked .
oh , she did ? really ?
oh , damn !
my daughter &apos;s a ninja .
oh , yeah . there goes baby b .
oh , you can tell &apos; em apart ?
of course .
and i almost had my manhood back .
yeah , &quot; almost &quot; being the operative word .
you just suffocated a doll with a diaper , donovan .
drink up .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m on duty .
i don &apos;t know why you even bother .
the bad guys aren &apos;t going anywhere , man .
i mean , if anything , they &apos;re multiplying .
so that &apos;s it , huh ?
you &apos;re just gonna give up ?
we grew up there , ty . that is your town .
was my town .
now it &apos;s a cesspool that &apos;s not worth getting killed over .
getting out was the best thing that ever happened to me .
who &apos;s that ?
someone who wasn &apos;t invited .
wasn &apos;t sure you &apos;d make it .
well , anything to postpone studying for midterms .
did you buy off the registry ?
you mean that list of demands .
no . see , i refuse to purchase anything called a milk warmer .
so instead i bought these tiny , little socks
that for some reason look like laced @-@ up sneakers .
socks count as practical . good .
that &apos;s how we &apos;ll sell it to caroline .
come on . i &apos;ll get you a drink ,
although , fair warning ,
they &apos;re in baby bottles .
infants drinking .
what a lovely image .
can &apos;t say i &apos;m surprised .
are you just going to surrender your town to the enemy ?
i get it . you &apos;re a hell @-@ world hangover .
but i already passed the test , henry .
i already admitted my fault .
you can leave me alone .
you passed the test , yes ,
but you haven &apos;t completed your liberation .
oh , yeah . liberate this .
very realistic head trip .
we should probably skip the check .
so you want to tell me what the heretic &apos;s doing here ?
probably &apos; cause i invited her .
so we spend all morning killing julian &apos;s vampires ,
then you invite one to caroline &apos;s shower ?
first of all , she &apos;s not julian &apos;s .
and second of all , she helped us get stefan out of that stone .
after she put him in ,
after she killed my graduating class , kidnapped caroline ,
and then murdered every human at her anniversary party .
i see her studying by herself every day .
and , honestly , i felt bad .
so i invited her .
it &apos;s better to have a powerful heretic
as a friend than an enemy .
and i &apos;m quite good at gifts .
don &apos;t forget that .
perhaps it &apos;s time for me to leave .
yeah , perhaps you should .
no , i invited you . you should stay .
i would ,
but i &apos;m afraid your friend here may say something inappropriate to me
and then find himself never able to speak again .
did you just threaten me ?
oh , i didn &apos;t , actually .
that would have looked like this .
take another step toward me
and i &apos;ll pluck your vocal cords from your throat
and use them to play a rather sporting game of pin the tail on the deputy .
stop ...
please .
the party was lovely .
thank you .
when were you going to tell me
that you lost your grip on reality ?
i just did . i like to use visual aids .
you need to tell me what you &apos;re going through
because it only gets worse from here .
worse than you envisioning me as a waiter ?
who was i next ? a busboy ? a valet ?
you were everywhere .
i couldn &apos;t sleep ,
couldn &apos;t eat , couldn &apos;t get you out of my head .
the only constant i had was caroline .
another nightmare ?
yeah , the same one .
i was in the quarry . i was--
i was drowning .
and damon was there .
damon was there ?
then what ?
doesn &apos;t matter . it &apos;s over .
clearly it &apos;s not .
whatever you experienced in that rock
is still torturing you somehow .
you &apos;re lucky you have her to hold on to , brother .
you &apos;re not here .
who are you talking to ?
get out of here , caroline .
yeah . get out of here , caroline ,
before i rip those babies right out of your belly .
enough !
stop ! it &apos;s not real . it &apos;s not real .
but then i pushed her away , too .
i lost sight of everything .
i barely even noticed when julian took over our town .
all i could see was you .
where &apos;s mom when you need her ?
&apos;cause fat chance you &apos;re winning this showdown .
why are you still here ?
i &apos;m a piece of the stone puzzle .
if you figure it out , i &apos;ll leave you alone .
until then ...
i couldn &apos;t get rid of you .
i couldn &apos;t stop seeing you . i couldn &apos;t stop hearing you .
nothing else mattered .
not our town , not julian ,
not even caroline .
all i cared about was making you go away .
so ?
pins and needles over here , brother .
what did you do ?
i got a can of gasoline .
i was convinced that the only solution was to burn your actual body .
i had to stop you from haunting me .
i had to get rid of any reminder
of what i went through in the hellstone .
what are you doing ?
i don &apos;t want him to come back ever .
i have to get rid of him .
this isn &apos;t who you are , stefan .
you love your brother .
and i know that you would rather die than let him go .
caroline found me just in time .
without her , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to stop myself .
i would have set your body on fire to end my own suffering .
well , that explains why i smelled like gas when i woke up .
you ok ?
i &apos;m not the one you should be worried about .
you should have left me at the grill , stefan ,
let me deal with the consequences of my own actions , but , no .
saint stefan to the rescue .
always there to clean up his big brother &apos;s messes .
what are you talking about ?
quit trying to save me , brother .
this is what your brother did to ellis .
he didn &apos;t know what he was doing .
really ? he was just fishing around for his liver
and came across his heart ?
i promise i will get him under control .
well , i strongly recommend you find him first .
what ?
he was just here .
hmm , no , i assure you he was not .
you were alone when i arrived .
you were talking to yourself .
perhaps that stone isn &apos;t finished with you after all .
in the meantime , if either you or your brother
harm one of my men again ,
i will gut the one of you
and feed the other the entrails .
thanks for stepping away from babyland .
anything to avoid a guessing game
about how big caroline &apos;s belly is .
yeah .
what do you want ?
i need to see elena .
that &apos;s not an option .
wait . i just want to see her face for a minute .
a little reminder that everything &apos;s gonna be ok , you know ?
when you gave me her coffin ,
you made me swear to not let anybody see her ,
especially you .
i was feeling a little sentimental .
you told me that &apos;s what you would say .
you figured at some point , you &apos;d get impatient
or lose your nerve or have a really bad day .
you said under no circumstance am i allowed to give her to you .
i changed my mind .
i know what happened the other night .
i know you &apos;re sick .
where is stefan anyway ?
listen to me ,
we can walk upstairs right now
and turn that baby shower into a bloodbath
or you can take me to see my girl .
no muss , no fuss . just ...
just a little visit , ok ?
damn it .
oh , man .
grove hill p.d.
license and registration , please .
officer , look , i am a cop , too .
if you let me just show you my badge .
mr. donovan .
the good news is you actually have a valid license ,
which means at some point you did learn how to drive .
the bad news is that can only mean
you &apos;re swerving between lanes because you &apos;re drunk .
i &apos;m not drunk . i had a couple drinks at a party ...
step out of the car , please , now .
are you kidding me ?
nice security , he said with contempt .
you told me to keep her safe , and i did .
you don &apos;t need to secure someone
if no one knows where they are .
me again .
no , no , no .
no .
excuse me for one second .
why didn &apos;t you answer your phone ?
i &apos;m sorry . i was using it for the playlist .
are--are you all right ?
has damon been here ?
no . why would he be ?
i don &apos;t know where he is .
i thought he was with me , and then he wasn &apos;t . and ...
ok , ok , stefan ,
just calm down . focus .
hey , wha--what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s happening again .
look , i was talking to damon ,
and i think he was there ,
but now i don &apos;t know when he left .
it &apos;s ok .
you &apos;re ok .
no , i &apos;m not . and neither is he .
can &apos;t you find someone else to haunt ?
i can &apos;t leave until you find liberation .
you &apos;re still denying your nature .
you haven &apos;t let go of what &apos;s holding you back .
what does that hellstone have to do with my true nature ?
a phoenix stone . it doesn &apos;t trap you .
it frees you ...
to be reborn as your true self .
you want to see my true self ?
i need to go find damon .
no , you don &apos;t . you know what ?
we are going to take care of you first .
how are you gonna take care of me ?
my soul was literally trapped in a rock .
yeah , until you passed some kind of test .
you never told me how you earned your freedom .
bonnie pulled me out with a spell . you know that .
no . something else happened in that hell @-@ world ,
something that you won &apos;t admit .
you can &apos;t keep hiding like this , stefan .
you can &apos;t . just , please , let me help you .
there &apos;s nothing we can do about it now , ok ?
ah , you have to tell me .
it &apos;s the only way that we &apos;re gonna get through it .
you have to try .
just ... god . you can &apos;t go on like this .
i was living in a repeating loop of misery .
every loop ended with damon dragging me into the quarry .
the water was black and freezing .
we were drowning together .
every time i tried to swim to the surface ,
he dragged me back down .
every time i tried to save him , i died , too .
i finally realized that there was only way to escape .
if i wanted to survive ,
i had to go on without him .
so i let him go .
i abandoned him .
i let my brother drown
so i could save myself .
so that &apos;s why you &apos;re hallucinating him ?
because some faux version of your brother is upset
with something that you did in a fake reality ?
the hellstone is trying to tell me something .
it &apos;s trying to prove a point .
i will never be happy
until damon is out of my life for good .
do you really believe that ?
you took my words to heart , did you ?
shut up . i &apos;m not doing this with you anymore .
i told you to leave me alone .
now i &apos;m gonna end this .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re not doing it with me anymore .
henry ?
i promised you liberation .
no .
elena !
this was necessary , damon .
she held you back from being the monster
you really are .
no . elena !
oh , my god . no .
no ! no , elena !
oh , god . elena .
in case it wasn &apos;t obvious ,
today was supposed to be a fresh start .
oh , spare me the lecture .
what the hell is your problem ?
i was trying to be nice to you .
after i left your wretched party ,
i found this in my mail .
is this your idea of a joke ?
postcard ?
you have a pen pal .
if you sent this , you &apos;d best admit it now
before i squeeze the truth from your trachea .
why would i send this to you ?
and even if i did , what &apos;s so scary about the alphabet ?
it &apos;s a warning ...
from the huntress .
you &apos;re saying that like i should know who that is .
you certainly know her weapon .
a sword .
yes .
custom @-@ made for her .
she used it to put julian in the stone
along with thousands of other vampires .
she &apos;s ruthless .
once you &apos;ve been marked by her sword ,
she never stops hunting you .
that &apos;s how beau got his scar .
she &apos;ll come to him now .
she &apos;ll come for all of us .
then how do we stop her ?
there &apos;s no stopping her ever .
and there &apos;s no &quot; we &quot; involved .
besides , she &apos;s not after you ,
so it &apos;s really not your concern .
if my friends &apos; lives are in danger ,
i &apos;m not gonna stand by and do nothing .
then what do you propose we do ?
all right , officer donovan , you &apos;re clear to go .
but i can &apos;t let you drive yourself home .
i think i &apos;ll wait it out .
sure you don &apos;t want to call a friend ?
that girl who does our turndown service just left .
i &apos;m a little light in the friend department right now .
i heard about your graduation--
the whole freak mining fire thing .
i can &apos;t imagine what it &apos;d be like to lose half my class .
sorry you had to go through that .
thanks .
it &apos;s weird town officials didn &apos;t get fema involved
or at least increase emergency response .
it &apos;s almost like everyone &apos;s resigned
to letting the fires burn out on their own .
yeah . that &apos;s the way it seems .
except if everyone sits around doing nothing ,
there &apos;s not gonna be a town left .
anyway , good night .
oh , and , uh , one last thing .
what the hell did we find in your truck ?
i think that i should wash these onesies
with the hypoallergenic detergent first .
where are the keys to the laundry room ?
it &apos;s midnight , caroline .
i mean , we &apos;ve got plenty of time to take care of all this stuff .
yeah , i know . i know .
we should also really get a head start on those car seats
because i read somewhere
that first @-@ time parents are just always messing those up .
and did you happen to notice if the monitor
came with little batteries ?
you don &apos;t have any around here .
and the last thing that you need are just
these screaming , crying babies in the middle of the night ,
and you can &apos;t even hear them .
hey , what &apos;s going on with you ? you ok ?
when were you gonna tell me that you &apos;re leaving ?
when i officially got the job .
and what &apos;s wrong with the job that you have now ?
there &apos;s nothing wrong with the job .
it &apos;s the place .
faculty day care . hello !
and you have preschool right here on the campus .
caroline , i am not raising my kids anywhere near mystic falls
or whitmore college or--
vampires .
that &apos;s right .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
i thought all this baby stuff bonanza , you know ,
all this single parent on their own--
yeah . no , it was .
caroline , i was under the impression ,
you know , that once the babies were born ...
that you weren &apos;t gonna be involved .
uh , no . i won &apos;t ,
because they &apos;re not mine .
they &apos;re yours and jo &apos;s .
anyway , i actually think it &apos;s really smart .
you know , safety first .
you and your babies should get as far away from here as you can .
where were you ?
out .
i had to clear my head .
i let you go .
in my virtual hell , we were drowning together .
and the only way for me to escape was to turn my back on you .
and everything i &apos;ve been hallucinating since was to
drive that point home .
of course it was .
the only way for you to be the hero
and have a happy ending is to leave me in your wake .
how do you figure ?
because my true self is dark , brother .
and all that light just keeps getting in the way ...
keeping me from being who i really am .
which is what ?
reckless ? manipulative ?
selfish ?
sounds about right .
yeah . it is .
but you &apos;re also my brother .
i &apos;m not gonna give up on you . not now ,
not ever .
you &apos;re stuck with me , damon .
i need you to know that .
stefan , i , uh ... i ...
what is it ?
i , um ...
whatever it is , you can tell me .
we &apos;re out of bourbon .
is that it ?
that &apos;s it .
here &apos;s to drowning together .
we apologize for the interruption to your current program .
my name is caroline .
please listen carefully .
i have an urgent message for stefan salvatore .
we apologize for the interruption ...
what are you doing here ?
i thought you were in mystic falls .
i had to stop by and visit some buddies at dallas pd
and convince them that this hostage thing was a hoax . get up .
you can put the gun down .
get up .
thank you .
you can go now .
that &apos;s it ?
you already did what we needed .
we ? you &apos;re helping her ?
you &apos;re the easiest way to get to stefan .
don &apos;t take it personally .
&quot; don &apos;t take it personally &quot; ?
