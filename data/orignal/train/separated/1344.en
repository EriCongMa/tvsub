Okay.
Whoever said that you feel great after a workout
never went for a run in the middle of a heat wave.
Well, when perspiration evaporates from the skin,
it extracts the heat by vaporization
in order to change into a gaseous state,
resulting in a cooling effect.
So I need to run faster and sweat more to cool off?
Guys, that's dangerous.
Here, here, here. Give me that.
We were just trying to cool off.
All right, well, you come over here
or that water's gonna knock you on your swimsuit.
There you go.
Thanks, ma'am.
What? "Ma'am"? Really?
They're so cute.
You're still going to be a mother someday,
and you're going to be a great one.
Thanks.
Hi, Angela.
Hi.
Hey, ma. What are you doing here?
Well, Maura told me you guys were going out for a run,
so I went and I got some sweat tea.
Those guys over at Herbland recommended it.
It helps keep you cool.
Ma, this tea is steaming hot.
And it smells disgusting.
It's the peppers.
Uh, well, the cultures of some of the hottest places on earth
consume hot and spicy food because it makes you sweat.
Rizzoli.
Isles.
Okay, yeah, we'll be right there.
Got to go.
But try it. It'll keep you cool.
Yeah, so will sitting in front of an open beer fridge,
and you don't have to vomit first.
Maybe next time.
Ugh, my A.C. sucks.
I was so hot last night, I didn't get any sleep.
You have central air-conditioning, right?
Uh, yes, but I don't use it.
Why, you trying to make me feel bad?
Because I sleep in the nude.
Note to self -- no follow-up questions.
Well, it helps to lower body temperature,
which stimulates your cortisol.
I can regulate my own cortisol, thank you.
What do we got?
Male, no apparent lacerations, signs of neglect.
I'm guessing shih tzu.
Maybe a hint of poodle.
I found this little guy
wandering around with signs of heat stroke.
Couldn't just leave him.
He's very cute. What about the victim?
Our victim's Richard Nelson.
Male, 28 years old, up on the third floor.
What's wrong with you?
Third floor, Jane.
So?
The power's out.
Uh, too many people running their A.C.s overnight.
No elevator. I've been running up and down for an hour.
Well, why don't you wait out here.
Take a little break.
Maybe the dog's owners will show up.
You see how that dog is panting to cool down?
Works for humans, too.
Since when did South Boston get a hipster arts district?
Its realtors rebranded this neighborhood "Sobo."
Don't say that. That is not a thing.
Oh, it is a thing, Jane.
I get invited to sobo art galleries all the time.
There's the landlord.
I'll meet you guys inside.
I'm telling you I can't do anything till the police take a look.
They're here now. I'll call you back later.
Sorry.
What can you tell us about the victim?
He was, um, a good tenant.
Quiet, and always paid his rent a week early.
What did he do for a living?
He was a bartender.
A bartender can afford a place in this neighborhood?
Oh, his apartment was rent controlled.
But he's been here a long time, about 8 years B.S.
"B.S."?
Before sobo.
All right, uh, how did you find him?
I came up about 10:30 this morning
when a neighbor from downstairs --
she complained about water leaking from the ceiling.
Okay, thanks.
You bet.
What caused the leak?
Follow me.
That's a lot for one guy.
Did the neighbors hear anything?
Nothing.
Okay, it is ridiculously hot.
I'm opening a window.
Shit.
Painted shut?
No, there are water spots in the dust.
It looks like something was dragged over the windowsill.
If we open the window, we might destroy evidence.
Oh, the curse of competence.
Hey, um, can you guys get a sample of this?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks. There's a fiber right there.
Body's in there.
Heat waves and dead bodies do not mix.
Mm. Time of death?
It's hard to tell.
The upper body is badly decomposed
due to the extreme heat,
And the lower extremities are well-preserved.
So he's half-baked.
Well, that's weird.
What?
Well, core body temperature for the lower extremities
is 65 degrees.
It was 90 degrees last night.
Did the landlord say that he turned the running water off?
No, he told me he bolted when he saw the body.
Maybe he was in a big tub of ice.
After a bottle of whisky,
it might have seemed like a good idea.
Well, alcohol acts as a vasodilator.
It makes the person feel warm
while their body temperature's actually dropping.
So if he was drunk, he might not have realized
he was getting so cold.
Hypothermia?
It's possible.
Freezing to death in the middle of a heat wave.
Just when I thought we'd seen everything.
This is the coolest -- place in the building.
Well, the autopsy room is on a separate system.
Can't let the bodies deteriorate from the heat.
Why do you have an audience?
Oh, well, they just wanted to observe an autopsy.
Orozco from media relations
and Anders from the carriage unit?
Oh, hi, Detective Rizzoli.
Welcome. You're just in time to hear the autopsy report.
They are using you for your cool air.
I know, but I'll take any opportunity
to get people interested in science.
Now, initially, I wasn't able to see due to the bloating.
But once I made the "Y" incision,
I was able to determine that the victim had a crushed larynx.
Poor guy.
Please hold your questions and comments till the end.
Thank you, Susie. So the cause of death was --
Strangulation?
That is right. It is strangulation.
Yay, science.
Also, uh, the lab results came back
on the fibers from the windowsill,
And they were from a heavy-duty composite rope.
And what about the tox results?
The blood-alcohol level was a 0.19.
So he was drunk enough that he'd be easy to strangle.
And then once he was dead, he was put on ice.
That's what it looks like.
By why would someone use ice?
To obscure time of death?
Slow down decomposition? Hide the smell?
Maybe allow for more time to escape?
You're being somewhat non-committal.
It's hot. I wouldn't poke the bear.
Metaphorically speaking.
Thank you, Maura Jr.
Well, now we're going to practice
weighing internal organs.
And let's start with the liver.
Yeah, I'm cool enough.
I'm sorry, Dr. Isles.
One step at a time, Susie.
One step at a time.
It would have taken over 100 pounds of ice
for that tub to overflow.
That's a hell of an ice delivery.
Well, the dust on the windowsill was recently disturbed,
and we found rope fibers,
so he must have pulled it up through the window.
Okay, you know what I've realized?
That this is just hot air moving faster.
What do we know about the victim?
Oh, he was arrested once in college
for disorderly conduct.
Other than that, pretty unremarkable.
Landlord said he had a girlfriend
with bright red hair, freckles, but she didn't come by much.
Well, maybe this is just one of those rare occasions, you know?
They're having drinks, they get in a lover's quarrel,
and she strangles him.
She'd have to be a big girl
to be strong enough to haul him into the tub.
Well, we won't know until we find her.
Okay. I'm going to get an ice coffee.
You said hell would freeze over
before you drank ice coffee.
Too hot.
I'm done dog-sitting.
Hey, why did you lock up little Sipowicz?
I thought you weren't gonna name it.
Well, I got to call it something before I find his people.
Sipowicz, come.
Call it whatever you want. It's not gonna listen.
He'll listen to me. Sipowicz, come.
Sit.
Heel. Sipowicz.
Good luck, dog whisperer.
Man, it's hot in here.
You want to take our laptops and go work in the autopsy room?
Hanging out with dead bodies is not really my thing,
so I vote for solving the crime and going home.
What is it?
This guy had a lot of money squirreled away --
A dozen brokerage accounts,
ranging from $40,000 to $300,000.
You sure?
He only had like $600 in his checking account.
He's a millionaire.
I'm not sure I can add properly with my brain on fire,
but I think that's right.
So we have a giant pile of money for motive.
Now we just got to figure out who knew he had it.
Sipowicz, come.
Treat. Treat.
Wait, wait!
Sipowicz, ven aquí.
Muy bien.
Muy bien.
Muy bien. Habló einstein espanol solo.
Vámonos.
Vámonos.
It turns out the broker's name
was the same on all the accounts --
Alex Ruebens, Fisk Financials.
I-I called his office.
His assistant said he was in the neighborhood
and would meet us here.
Well, did she ask why we wanted to see him?
I-I told her Richard was dead,
probably been killed for his large fortune,
and we had no leads and could really use Alex's help.
Seriously?!
No! I told her nothing.
This heat is making you crazy.
I bet a fancy investment firm has air-conditioning.
Alex Ruebens?
I'm Alex Ruebens.
I'm detective Jane Rizzoli.
I'm just gonna grab a coffee. You want one?
No, thank you.
Landlord said the girlfriend had red hair.
Did he suffer?
We don't know.
When was the last time you saw him?
Two days ago. We had lunch together.
How long were you dating?
Almost five years. We met at a funeral.
No... That sounds horrible.
I was at a funeral,
and he was bringing flowers to his grandmother's grave.
Miss Ruebens, why don't you sit down?
Any idea who killed him?
No.
Rich was very private.
But I assumed that was the artist in him.
He was an artist?
A novelist.
He worked at the bar to support his writing.
Seems like the money you were managing for him
would support him.
Where did it come from?
He found it.
He found it?
Yes.
Jogging -- he -- he showed me an article about
a drug-related shooting in the same park.
Why didn't he turn it in to the police?
I-I checked with an attorney.
You don't have to turn in found money.
Okay, so why work as a bartender if he was a millionaire?
He didn't want to spend the money
until he had finished writing his book.
I figured he was done because he asked me to set up
monthly transfers into a new checking account.
Okay, well, there was no will,
and there's no family to notify,
So where's the money go now?
A trust.
Who are the trustees?
I am.
Where were you last night?
At work.
Look, he deposited the money in installments,
and I have the last one at my house.
I will bring it in. I don't want his money.
There was a drug-related shooting in Stony Brook park
around the time rich said he found the money.
I just talked to my guy in the drug unit.
It was an undercover buy gone bad.
There was cash involved, but only 20 grand.
So he saw the article in the newspaper,
then used it as a cover story for his girlfriend.
That is a big lie.
Probably means the money is of a more dubious origin.
You think the girlfriend's involved?
I don't think she's strong enough
to pull ice up through a window,
much less haul him into a bathtub.
Sounds like a "Maybe."
It's a definite "Maybe."
Hey, did you find anything?
You know the great American novel he was writing?
"I was facing a financial crisis of my own.
"But for me, there would no bailout.
"The game is rigged,
and I was determined to fix the odds in my favor."
Continue.
That's it. It's less great than short.
If you ask me, it's the perfect length for a novel.
Wait a minute, okay, so he's lying about the novel.
He's lying about the money.
Where did this money come from?
Well, the best lies are usually half-truths.
So maybe he was a drug dealer.
Hipster drug dealer laying low in sobo.
Isn't that the bubble drink?
No, that's soba.
No, no, no, the noodles are soba. Bubble drinks are boba.
Sobo is what the hipsters are calling South Boston.
It's not a thing.
Never mind.
If he wasn't bartending to fund his creative dream,
maybe that is how he was making his money.
Drugs -- it's the American way.
Good morning, Angela.
Are you waiting for Jane?
No, no, I'm waiting for Korsak and Sipowicz.
I'm on dog-sitting duty.
Well, that sweat tea really seems to be working for you.
You just seem completely energized.
I am. Two cups this morning.
And I'm seeing colors I-I've not seen before.
Really?
You know, you didn't get to taste it the other day,
so I brought you another one.
Oh, how thoughtful. Thank you.
Hey, Angela, thank you very much for watching Sipowicz.
Oh! I just fed him, and he's already been walked.
Oh, great, no problem. I'll take good care of him.
Sipowicz, ven aqu. Sientate.
I love that you speak Spanish, Vince.
Say something else.
Muchas gracias, senorita.
Ven aqu. Ven aqu, perrito.
And that tie, uh, really, uh,
brings out the color in your eyes.
What are you talking about?
This tie is brown. My eyes are green.
Well, then you just look good for no reason, Vince.
Come on, Sipowicz.
We're sorry about your friend.
I can't believe he's gone.
He would have sold five copies of his novel
to every customer at the bar.
So you were close?
Rich changed my life.
I used to tell stories all the time,
and Rich got me into writing.
Man helped me finish my first memoir, "Unbouncable."
Sounds like a great guy.
He was.
Anybody feel differently?
What do you mean?
You know, someone who would want to hurt him?
I mean, if you asked me that question about a week ago,
I'd probably have said no.
But then the other night,
this guy walks in and tried to cut the line,
and I tried to stop him.
And he said Rich could vouch for him.
But when Rich saw him,
he got real nervous and told me not to let him in.
The guy was pissed.
You get a good look at the guy?
Sure.
We'll need you to sit with our sketch artist.
Okay.
Do you know anything about Rich selling drugs at the bar?
No way, man. Rich?
Rich is one of the most law-abiding people I ever met.
Just the idea of double parking a car
made him break into a sweat.
He have a reason to be so nervous?
That's just the way he was.
Maybe his nervousness was his artistic fuel.
Or maybe your friend was running on empty.
Hey, Todd. You change from the vampire shift?
No, Susie asked me to come help with the overcrowding issues.
Love of science catching on?
This is the hottest ticket in town.
And the coolest place in the building.
We're a sweaty bunch. Well, not you.
You're not sweaty. You're clammy.
Uh, moist.
Glistening?
Open the door, Todd.
Okay. Sorry.
Do those come with a free daiquiri?
You're so you sometimes.
Do you have something?
This is the cash
that the broker girlfriend gave us.
Did you know that all United States currency
is printed on a cotton-linen blend paper made by Crane & Co.,
which they've been
supplying since 1879?
Yes. You know what else is a fun fact?
Something that helps me catch the killer.
Okay.
The entire stack had consecutive serial numbers
printed in Fort Worth, Texas, in 2008.
Also, GC-MS scan showed no signs of drug residue,
which is very strange, given that 90% of U.S. bills
have cocaine imbedded in their fibers.
So no drug residue,
and they all were printed in 2008.
It's like they came out of printing
and never went into circulation.
Most likely.
I also found traces
of dried flowers, mold, and arsenic.
The money was poisoned?
Well, arsenic has many uses --
a wood preservative, insecticide.
Before 1910, it was used as an embalming fluid.
And most recently --
Embalming fluid.
Uh, the kind you find in old graves.
Not a grave...
but close.
Thanks, Maura.
So, Rich's girlfriend said they met here.
He was bringing flowers to his grandmother.
He lied about that, too?
No, the -- the grandmother's here.
And so is the great-grandmother.
And so is her sister, who died in 1906.
You working on their family tree?
I don't think the door's supposed to be open, is it?
The lock's busted. Someone broke in.
Clear...
which seems odd to say in the middle of a mausoleum.
Maybe it wasn't a break in.
Maybe it was a break out.
What, our killer's a zombie?
Could be fun.
Probably we wouldn't have to mirandize him or anything.
There's something in there.
Looks like Rich was using granny for an atm.
Which, sadly, puts a stake in your zombie theory.
Yeah, that's him.
Came around every Friday, like clockwork.
It's so nice when the youth visit with such frequency.
Such a shame.
Did he visit this past Friday?
Yeah, he was here.
Did Rich have any reason to break the lock?
No, he had my phone number.
If he'd lost his key, he would have just called.
I noticed the lock was missing
when I made my rounds Sunday afternoon.
I called and left Rich a voice message, but --
He never called you back.
No.
Thank you for your time.
The lock was broken before our victim was killed.
Somebody's looking for that money,
and Rich is dead because they didn't find it.
Csru get a print off the lock?
Barely a partial.
I don't know what I want more -- to find our killer,
or for the air-conditioning to come back on.
What did you find at the graveyard?
A broken lock and a duffel bag
with a couple old hundreds in it.
So that's where he was keeping his money all this time?
The real question is where did all that money come from?
I ran the serials from the cash his girlfriend brought in,
and it wasn't reported stolen
or mentioned in any police report.
Nothing.
Well, nobody gets handed $2.9 million for no reason.
It's grown to $2.9 million.
The deposits started in 2009.
He also opened more accounts as time went on.
How much did he start with?
Let's see.
In 2009, the interest was...
Making $550 per week as a bartender.
Well, he opened the fifth account in 2010.
Subtract monthly expenses and rent.
Rich was living off his income as a bartender,
but he wouldn't have been able to save anything.
Which means he would have started out with
exactly $2 million.
Nice, round number.
Can't you just get a sign
that says "autopsy employees only"?
We tried that, but it kept disappearing.
Where's Todd?
Oh, when Dr. Isles said you were coming down,
he said he needed to freshen up.
No.
Make it snappy, Maura. Todd went to go freshen up.
I don't know how long that takes,
and I don't want to find out.
Okay.
Our spectrophotometer shorted out because of the heat,
and we just got it back online,
so I finally finished my analysis
of the water from the bathtub.
This is tap water from the building.
It's consistent with what you'd get from the Quabbin reservoir,
which, as you know, provides water to all of Boston.
Yep, so delicious.
It also has all the compounds
that you'd expect to find in it --
barium, sodium, cryptosporidium, etcetera.
And this is the water that the victim was found in.
Did you find any other DNA in it,
or is just filled with more "-iums"?
No to both, but what is interesting
is actually what is missing from the water.
It's too hot to guess, Maura.
It lacks sodium.
It's been desalinated.
Yes, and desalinated water
is used in agricultural irrigation, on ocean vessels,
and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals,
semi-conductors, hard-disk drives.
So our killer could be a computer engineer,
a sailor, a farmer, a -- what was the last one?
Semi-truck?
Semi-conductor.
I can't! It's too hot to think!
Maybe you should just go home and rest.
I can't! It's too hot there, too.
Wait. Your A.C. works, right?
Uh, well, yes, it works.
Maybe I could stay at your place.
Oh, well, I mean, it works,
but I don't actually turn it on because I sleep --
I know, yes.
Would you just please turn it on tonight?
I suppose.
Thank you.
I'll bring you some pj's.
And if Todd comes back,
tell him that I'm staying at your house tonight.
I drove to work today
in a helmet, leather jacket, and boots.
Ah, there's some pretty sweet convertibles on autotrader.com.
Convertible?
Do I need to remind you how impractical
a convertible would be in Boston eight months of the year?
It's not like my motorcycle's any more practical.
I can't believe there's still no A.C..
If I wanted to work in these conditions, I'd be a baker.
No, you wouldn't.
No, I wouldn't.
Is it still cool in your world?
Yes, and crowded.
I can barely start a Rokitansky
without 50 sweaty people watching over me.
Well, they're so much better up close.
You think so?
Maybe, if I knew what a Rokifransky was.
Oh, come on. Get off of me.
Korsak, would you get this dog off of me?
That dog seems to be exhibiting displacement behavior.
It's called "humping," Dr. Isles.
You have to speak to him in Spanish.
Oh, really? Want me to pant, too?
Hey, come on, shoo.
I am serious.
That is a Spanish-speaking dog.
Sientate.
Muy bien.
Adiós.
Anyway, I checked with the Feds,
but they didn't know anything helpful.
Richard didn't have any experience
that would put him near that kind of cash.
And he worked at a bookstore out of college, got laid off.
Then he moved to the mailroom at Chen Industries.
Chen Industries?
Chen Industries?
Yeah. What did I miss?
Well, the C.E.O.'s son was kidnapped about six years ago,
but I never learned the details.
All I know is that the dad paid the ransom
and the kid was returned.
So are you saying
that our murder's connected this kidnapping?
I'd bet $2 million it.
Dr. Isles?
It's... can you believe this heat?
It is so hot.
Missed the ice-cream truck out there.
Eric Chen, son of billionaire Harold Chen,
C.E.O. of financial giant Chen Industries, was kidnapped.
Official report says B.P.D. got a call
from the boy's mother reporting the kidnapping.
Now, five days later, the family put out a press release
that Eric had been returned.
Was there any investigation?
Detectives kept trying.
But after the initial phone call,
the family refused to cooperate.
Guy's a billionaire who runs a Fortune 500 company.
Paying a big ransom is the fastest way to get his son back
Eric Chen also worked at Chen Industries.
Rich could have been watching him for months.
Rich was the inside man, and he had an accomplice.
They might have had an agreement.
Rich would keep the money in his family's mausoleum for six years
while they waited out the statue of limitations.
It was a smart plan. They made it.
What went wrong?
It wasn't up.
The statute runs out in three days.
That's when it will be six years from when Eric was returned.
So our killer wanted to make an early withdrawal,
and our victim didn't want to go along.
No one ever talked to Eric Chen about it.
Maybe he can lead us to Rich's murderer.
Where's the kid?
Not finding him.
No DMV or bank accounts. He's off the grid.
Well, we'll start with Harold Chen.
I'll bet he'll be more willing to talk to us
if he knows we found his money.
Where does someone get $2 million in cash?
Is there some special teller window for that?
You thinking of withdrawing the Rizzoli family fortune?
In order to get $2 million, one must have $2 million.
Harold Chen?
Boston Police.
We -- we'd like to talk to you about your son's kidnapping.
I'm late for a meeting.
It'll only take a second.
It was a long time ago.
I've got my son back. He's safe now.
Our family's been through enough.
We have reason to believe
that we may have found the ransom you paid.
I'm meeting with a company that's going to invest
hundreds of millions of dollars with us.
If I'm late, I lose a lot more than $2 million.
Well, that went well.
Well, at least he confirmed the $2 million was the ransom.
They started at Chen Industries at the same time.
Same age with zero experience.
Chen started as an executive,
and Nelson started in the mail room.
Nepotism sucks.
I'm right here, Jane.
I don't mean you.
Yes!
What is that?
It's a victory cha-cha. I found Sipowicz's people.
Finally.
Congratulations, Korsak.
Excuse me.
You were with Mr. Chen earlier today.
Yes. I'm his daughter.
Well, I work for him, too.
What can we do for you?
I'd like to know if there's any new information
on who kidnapped my brother?
Well, um, a recent case has been linked to the incident.
Getting any information about the kidnapping
would help us a lot.
Can you tell us anything?
Uh, no.
Eric didn't want to talk about it when we got him back,
and we didn't push him.
Well, we'd certainly like to hear his version of the story.
Do you think you'll catch the kidnappers?
That's what we're trying to do.
Can you tell us where he is?
健康中心
How long has Eric been here?
Oh, he checked himself in about 5.1/2 years ago.
I just assumed it was because he felt
like the kidnappers couldn't get him here.
66% of people with mental health issues never seek help,
so the fact that your brother checked himself in
means that, deep down, he really wants to get past this.
Hey, thanks for coming.
You're welcome.
Hey, Eric, it's Lucy.
Eric?
Eric!
Oh, sorry.
There's some people here that -- they want to talk to you.
Hi, Eric.
I'm detective Jane Rizzoli. This is Dr. Maura Isles.
I'm busy right now.
Okay.
Have you ever been to the top of Mount Wachusett?
That's what that is, right?
Yes.
Have you been?
Once, a long time ago.
Before...
Well, I've never smelled air so fresh.
Yeah.
And the view?
Eric, um...
We -- we found one of your kidnappers.
He's dead.
He was probably killed by an accomplice.
If you'll talk to us,
we think that we can find that person, too.
I-I don't know.
Eric.
You were denied the opportunity
for us to catch your kidnappers before.
Let us do that for you now.
Talk to us, Eric.
Maybe we can make you feel safe again.
What can you remember from right before you were kidnapped?
On Friday nights,
a bunch of people would go out drinking after work.
The high-level executives loved buying me drinks.
It was fun.
Before I knew it, I was really drunk --
drunker than I'd ever been.
You may have been drugged.
I wanted to get out of there before I embarrassed myself.
I vaguely remember going outside
and asking someone to get me a cab.
It's cloudy from there.
How many of them were there?
There were two men.
I thought of them as the nice one and the jumpy one.
Do you remember any conversations they had,
anything else about them?
I remember waking up blindfolded and tied to the chair.
At some point, I talked to my dad.
They made me tell him I was alive.
Do you remember any distinctive sounds,
like a highway or bells, music.
I heard horns.
Okay. Uh, car horns?
No.
It sounded bigger than that.
Like a foghorn?
Maybe.
Okay. That's good.
Can you remember anything else about where you were?
Was it hot? Was it cold?
It smelled.
I remember it smelled awful sometimes.
Can you describe the smell?
It was like sewage.
That's all I remember. I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's okay. You did great, okay?
Okay.
Of all the people Rich called the year of the kidnapping,
a handful had records.
One of them, Billy Skolnick,
was a roommate of his in college.
Matches the sketch the bouncer friend gave us.
He's got assault and battery charges, drunk and disorderly.
He's also bought three boats in the last five years.
They've all been repossessed.
Guy really wants a boat.
He was expelled from college for stealing A.V. equipment,
then started working as a commercial fisherman.
Eric didn't see where he was being held,
but he may have heard a foghorn,
and he said it smelled like sewage.
The smell of low tide. Probably up near the wharves.
Uh, we have a partial print from the mausoleum lock.
I'll try to backwards match it
to the print from Billy's record.
Fishing boats have equipment
for desalinating sea water for long trips.
They use that water to make ice for packing fish.
Or for packing dead bodies. Where is he now?
He works on a boat
that docks next to the east Boston fish market.
So he must have showed up ready to get his money
and then got upset when Rich told him he invested it.
When he broke into the mausoleum and saw it wasn't there,
he just assumed his partner ripped him off.
Fingerprint matches.
Let's go get him.
No boat for Billy.
Excuse me. Looking for Billy Skolnick.
Over there.
Freeze! Boston Police!
Move, move, move!
Billy Skolnick,
you are under arrest for the kidnapping of Eric Chen
and the murder of Richard Nelson.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
So the surviving kidnapper
will be in jail for the rest of his life.
You checked yourself in here,
and you can check yourself out.
There are fantastic outpatient facilities
for you when you're ready.
Okay.
Eric?
Cold beer and cold wine.
Yes, and yes.
So, Jane, I ran some lab tests
on that sweat tea that Angela's been pushing.
And you realized it's disgusting.
Good job, doctor.
Well, I noticed that after drinking it
both Angela and Sipowicz were exhibiting...
unusual signs of arousal.
Ew, no, don't.
Just -- just get to the point.
Well, the main ingredient is ají charapita,
which is consumed primarily in a jungle in Peru,
and it is a potent aphrodisiac.
Hey, girls.
Up here.
Yeah. So, you look great, Ma.
What, a mom can't look nice?
Angela, I have to tell you something about that tea.
I know you girls don't like it.
Yes.
No.
Well, I never tasted it,
but I have tested it in my lab,
and it's chemically enhancing you.
In a bad way?
Yes.
It's an aphrodisiac.
Well, how long will it take to wear off?
I would say about two days.
You ready to go, Angela?
Yeah, well...
...might as well make it count.
Shall we?
Maura.
What is it?
Caliente.
I'm good.
No.
Try some.
Don't touch it.
