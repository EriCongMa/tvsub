猫中之王 别扭大菜
hey , ready for lunch ?
oh , one sec .
is that the prototype drive system for the high @-@ g rover ?
no , bernadette got me a fitbit
so she can track how much i &apos;m exercising .
that &apos;ll teach her to care about your health .
i can &apos;t wait to see the look on her face when i die young .
when was the last actual exercise you got ?
the other day , when
she tried to put that fitbit on me and i ran away from her .
according to a recent study ,
simply thinking about exercise , even while sitting still ,
can have physical benefits .
for all you know , i could be exercising right now .
are you ?
eh , i &apos;ll do it tomorrow .
it wouldn &apos;t be the worst thing if we were more active .
oh . you make an excellent point .
ooh , i think i &apos;m getting a runner &apos;s high !
会有如同吗啡一样的止痛和欣快感
look at all these activities the university has .
rock climbing club , archery , flag football .
had me at flag , lost me at football .
yeah , i think it &apos;s great you guys want to get more exercise ,
but do you really think sports is the right choice for you ?
what are you saying ?
we &apos;re not coordinated enough to play sports ?
okay , leonard , sweetheart ,
you twisted your ankle playing scrabble .
i got a triple @-@ word score with a double letter &quot; q. &quot;
if that &apos;s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance ,
what &apos;s the point of having one ?
hey , barry kripke started a fencing club .
interesting .
sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal .
and i would imagine it meets many
of our personal criteria for a sport .
it &apos;s indoors , so no sunscreen .
no throwing , no catching ,
no running .
no gym shorts that can be yanked down .
or worse , up .
preach .
and as an added bonus ,
the word &quot; touche &quot; comes from fencing .
it would be our only opportunity to use it
in a non @-@ metaphorical sense .
what about a game of tag on a french schoolyard ?
ah , touche .
thanks for coming by .
sure . so how can we help ?
well , i know more women are buying comics than ever ,
but for some reason , i @-@ i can &apos;t get &apos; em in here .
all right , well , what have you tried so far ?
uh , i &apos;ve @-@ i &apos;ve been stocking more female @-@ oriented titles .
uh , in the bathroom ,
i folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle .
and , uh ,
you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area .
really ? in a comic book store ?
oh , don &apos;t worry . i @-@ i &apos;ve got a camera right up here ,
so i could watch from the counter
and make sure guys aren &apos;t being pervs .
anyway , so what do i got to do to @-@ to
get you in the door ?
well , for starters ,
you might want to rethink some of this artwork .
i mean , this woman &apos;s actually on a leash like a dog .
well , you don &apos;t know the backstory .
maybe she kept jumping up on the couch .
i feel cool .
like puss in boots .
i always wanted to be a swashbuckler when i was a kid .
technically , &quot; swashbuckler &quot; is a combination of two terms .
&quot; swash &quot; referring to the sound of the sword .
swash .
and then &quot; buckler &quot;
meaning a small shield , which you don &apos;t have .
we can still be swashers .
well said , puss .
gentlemen , welcome to the fencing club .
before we start , i just want to warn you ,
fencing isn &apos;t a joke .
i hope you &apos;re not here because you think it &apos;s going to be
like star wars .
that &apos;s not why we &apos;re here .
yeah , i &apos;m here because i think it &apos;s gonna be like game of thrones .
and maybe a little princess bride .
ooh , ooh ! i forgot about princess bride !
that &apos;s my answer !
well , sorry to disappoint you ,
but fencing is a serious sport .
if you &apos;re not willing to put in the effort ,
you might as well just leave now .
we &apos;re not afraid of physical activity .
i already ran 18 miles today .
all right . let &apos;s begin with some fundamentals .
this is the en garde position .
feet are in an &quot; l. &quot; heels in a straight line .
elbow is about a fist from the rib cage .
notice my dominant leg faces forward .
oh , dear .
what &apos;s wrong , cooper ?
well , i &apos;m not sure i have a dominant leg .
they &apos;re both pretty submissive .
when you &apos;re in a public restroom ,
which foot do you flush the toilet with ?
right . always right .
he &apos;s a righty .
okay , show me en garde .
good . knees bent ,
slightly over the toe .
non @-@ sword hand up for balance .
i am going to feel this tomorrow .
the first move is called an advance .
you move your front foot forward , heel to toe .
back foot follows .
so front foot forward , heel to toe .
back foot follows .
now you try . advance .
and advance . and advance .
this is easy . i didn &apos;t need to wear a cup .
good .
the next move is called a retreat .
step back .
back foot first , toe to heel .
front foot follows .
on three .
excuse me , barry ?
yes .
when can i stab one of my friends ?
in fencing , we don &apos;t call it a stab .
we call it a touch .
uh , yes , i &apos;m aware .
but if i say i want to touch one of my friends ,
i &apos;ll get called into human resources .
okay , on three ,
cooper and koothrappali advance , the other two retreat .
one , two , three .
very good . switch it up .
one , two , three .
switch again . one , two , three .
excuse me .
can i call you back ?
no , i &apos;m teaching a class .
sure . sure .
an hour , tops .
yeah . okay .
okay . yeah .
okay . thanks .
and one , two , three .
have you thought about advertising directly to females ?
hmm , okay .
well ... all right .
what if i put up a sign in the window that said ,
&quot; women , come in .
don &apos;t be afraid . &quot;
uh , have you read the online reviews for this place ?
eh , the internet &apos;s so negative .
i try to avoid it .
all right , well , heather h. says ,
&quot; the owner stared at me the whole time
and didn &apos;t blink once . &quot;
kelly m. says ,
&quot; the creepy guy who runs it asked me out ,
then called himself stupid before i could say no . &quot;
jessica k. says ,
&quot; i told the weird owner that i liked his shirt .
he took it off and gave it to me . &quot;
see ? negative .
with your foil extended ,
kick your front leg up
and push off with your back leg .
now you try .
and again .
and again .
look at us ! we &apos;re like the rockettes !
en garde , leonard .
prepare yourself for a rigorous touching .
my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
i thought you were puss in boots .
oh , yeah , right . sorry .
my name is puss in boots .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
i &apos;m looking forward to him teaching us glove @-@ slapping .
what ?
you know , when my honor is insulted ,
and i need to challenge someone to a duel
by slapping them across the face with my glove .
when was your honor insulted ?
my last physical .
again , that doctor didn &apos;t insult your honor .
just checked your prostate .
my name is little orphan annie .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
my name is darth vader .
i am your father .
prepare to die .
this is fun .
good .
it &apos;s nice to see your mind off amy .
what &apos;s going on with amy ?
not that it &apos;s any of your business ,
but she broke up with me .
really ?
good to know .
&quot; good to know &quot; ?
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i hate to say it , but it sounds like he &apos;s interested in her .
well , that &apos;s unacceptable .
oh , buddy , i get that you don &apos;t like it ,
but it &apos;s not really up to you .
yeah , but he &apos;s dumb , and his face is dumb .
look , even if it &apos;s not him ,
amy &apos;s probably going to date someone at some point .
you really think so ?
of course . she deserves to be happy .
how dare you !
listen , i should warn you
that maybe asking amy out isn &apos;t a good idea .
barry , a word ?
and now the crazy version of what i just said .
if you intend to pursue amy ,
you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it .
and how are you gonna do that ?
by challenging you to a duel .
you &apos;ve had one lesson . i &apos;ll destroy you .
that is why the duel will take place
at high noon , three years from today .
if you &apos;re worth your salt as an instructor ,
i should be ready by then .
yeah , and be warned .
i &apos;m going to touch you all over .
that @-@ that was crazier than i thought .
all right , i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s true ,
but let &apos;s @-@ let &apos;s consider for a moment
that possibly i &apos;m the problem .
yeah .
you are .
you can say it .
okay , fine . what ... ?
i mean , what can i do ?
i get so nervous around women .
well , you &apos;re talking to us now .
i mean , you don &apos;t seem nervous .
well , that &apos;s &apos; cause i &apos;m doing that trick
where you imagine the audience is naked .
by the way , thumbs up , ladies .
do you not hear how creepy that sounds ?
it was a joke .
was it ?
no , i &apos;m still doing it .
okay .
don &apos;t be offended , but ...
what went wrong with you ?
i @-@ i guess i assumed at this point in my life ,
i would be married or in a relationship ,
or even have a pet
that didn &apos;t run away or kill itself .
that really happened ?
i mean , i can &apos;t say for sure ,
but i swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye
before it hopped in front of that car .
anyway , the longer i &apos;m alone ,
the more desperate i get .
stuart , believe it or not , i understand .
you know , before i met sheldon ,
i was alone for a really long time .
i was so desperate for people to like me ,
when i met these guys ,
it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity .
okay , we &apos;re all feeling it .
yes , i &apos;ll go out with you .
suddenly , the rabbit thing makes sense .
i &apos;m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar , sheldon .
look at this blister .
like it or not , we &apos;re athletes now .
besides , a bar is where i belong .
i &apos;m having female problems .
if you &apos;re cranky and retaining water , i have a theory .
sheldon , instead of focusing on amy dating other guys ,
maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
why ?
you never thought you &apos;d end up in a relationship ,
and then you met amy .
maybe there &apos;s someone else out there for you .
true , but penny &apos;s married , and so is bernadette .
and your girlfriend has red hair and white skin ,
which really rubs up against my clown phobia .
maybe you should consider women
who aren &apos;t in serious relationships
with your closest friends ?
there &apos;s that prostate doctor , but i &apos;m still mad at her .
oh , there &apos;s a woman .
oh , i &apos;ll make her my girlfriend .
walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn &apos;t work .
you &apos;re forgetting something .
ladies love jocks .
how many sips of that beer did he have ?
three .
oh , boy .
excuse me . i &apos;m recovering from a recent breakup ,
and i &apos;m told asking out another woman
might make me feel better .
and as ash ketchum said to pikachu ,
&quot; i choose you . &quot;
what ?
it &apos;s a pokemon reference .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
well , we gave it a shot .
how about you ?
i &apos;m married , and i &apos;m her grandmother .
ah , what might have been .
and you , give my regards to barnum and bailey .
stuart took that rejection like a pro .
well , he knew he was on the breast cam .
i don &apos;t have much experience turning men down .
it wasn &apos;t so much fun .
oh , you get used to it .
some guys you have to turn down over and over .
and sometimes we marry them anyway .
well , this is weird .
what ?
barry kripke just asked me out .
look at you-- two guys in one day !
i told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows !
what did he say ?
&quot; hi , how are you ? i was wondering
if you &apos;d like to get a drink after work sometime . &quot;
well , what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess i assumed that i would eventually date other people ,
but this is happening so fast .
what can it hurt ?
well , i was hoping the next person i dated
would be a little less like sheldon .
you mean , not a scientist ?
i think she means not a weirdo .
are you attracted to him ?
i don &apos;t know .
all right , well , what happens if you imagine him naked ?
oh , i don &apos;t have to imagine it .
i smell funny .
i taste salty .
you &apos;re just sweaty from exercise .
and kind of delicious .
i wonder how many licks it would take to get to the center of me .
i know it only takes one doctor &apos;s finger .
hello .
hello .
we should let you guys talk .
yeah .
you don &apos;t have to leave .
look at me go !
uh , bernadette , you &apos;re my ride .
walk !
how have you been ?
i &apos;m doing all right .
i tried fencing today .
how &apos;d that go ?
it was pretty easy .
and i think my background in &quot; mathletics &quot; helped .
barry kripke was there .
i should let you know
that he expressed interest in asking you out .
well , actually , he @-@ he already did .
okay .
but don &apos;t get too attached to him .
in two years , 364 days , he &apos;s a dead man .
i said no .
interesting .
i asked two women out today , and they both said no .
i didn &apos;t know you were interested in dating .
i &apos;ve been told it &apos;s a good way to move on .
okay .
anyway , um , it &apos;s nice to see you .
you look good .
mmm , thanks .
and i taste good too .
howie ?
what &apos;s up ?
why does your fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday ?
