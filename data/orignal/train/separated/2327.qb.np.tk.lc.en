for over a century , i have lived in secret until now .
i know the risk but i have to know her .
elena , she &apos;s a dead ringer for katherine .
what &apos;re you ?
i &apos;m a vampire .
i &apos;ve been 17 years old since 1864 .
i promise i will keep your secret .
but i can &apos;t be with you , stefan .
5 dead bodies are all drained of blood .
they &apos;ve come back .
hello brother .
damon .
she &apos;s in the transition .
into what ?
a vampire .
vicki . what the hell ?
why is everybody having to die on me ?
can you make him forget ?
i &apos;ll do it
what do you want him to know .
vicki left town .
he &apos;s gonna miss her . but he knows it &apos;s for the best .
damon ?
lexi ?
hi .
what are you doing here ?
how could you even ask that ?
i missed you .
happy birthday .
i don &apos;t know , ok .
some freak shot at me with wooden bullets ,
i &apos;d been buried under 60 .
and why is a news reporter hunting vampires ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know who knows about us .
i mean , that guy did .
there could be others . hey , do me a favor .
while you &apos;re here , please be careful .
why stay ?
i &apos;m headed to new york for the weekend .
bon jovi in the garden .
&quot; wanted dead or alive . &quot;
that &apos;s our theme song .
it &apos;ll be a blast .
hey , do you think that he would actually remember us ?
that was a pretty crazy weekend , huh ?
we can make him remember us .
come on !
let &apos;s go .
i mean , what &apos;s keeping you here ?
i told you .
her name is elena .
well , let &apos;s hope she &apos;s better
than the last girl you got all sprung over .
you didn &apos;t even know katherine .
&apos;cause if i did ,
i &apos;d kick her ass . little bitch .
speaking of ... where &apos;s damon ?
inflicting misery somewhere .
hey , um , you gonna be ok here alone ?
i got some things i gotta take care of .
well , it &apos;s not exactly like i can go anywhere .
and you and damon are the only ones
with these nifty little daylight rings .
i have a mood ring from &apos; 75 . trade ya ?
doesn &apos;t work that way , and you know it .
yeah .
hey , lex ...
i &apos;m really glad that you came here .
ok , what are we doing for your birthday ?
it &apos;s not every day a guy turns 162 years old .
really ?
oh , yeah .
where did vicki say she was going ?
she didn &apos;t .
did she tell her brother where she was going ?
no . she didn &apos;t say anything to me .
she told jeremy to tell me she was leaving town .
well , is there anyone i can talk to
that may know what happened
to her prior to her leaving town ?
stefan salvatore may know .
he came by the house to see her ,
but she wouldn &apos;t talk to him .
what was he doing there ?
i was trying to help her .
i knew that elena was worried about her brother .
he was dating vicki , and she had a drug problem ,
so i tried to help .
so you got involved because elena asked you to ?
i asked stefan to help .
i thought that by helping vicki ,
he was helping my brother .
what was her behavior like those last few days
before she left ?
up and down .
very sketchy ,
like she was coming down from some major party .
any signs of aggression or violence ?
not that i remember .
no . no .
so you believe vicki really has left town ?
yes .
yes .
yes .
i &apos;ll miss her , but ...
i think it &apos;s for the best .
i was tryin &apos; to help her , matt .
that &apos;s all .
i &apos;ll meet you guys at the car .
ok .
you ok ?
i don &apos;t think the sheriff suspected anything .
jeremy had no memory at all .
all he knew was what damon made him know .
thank you .
i can &apos;t do this , stefan .
every time i look at matt or jeremy ,
all i think is that vicki is never gonna come back ,
and they &apos;ll never know why .
around you , people get hurt , and people die ,
and i just--i-- it &apos;s just too much . i--
why don &apos;t we go somewhere and talk about it ?
no .
stefan , you have to stay away from me .
hello , lexi .
what an unexpected surprise .
unexpected surprise ?
i think the wrong brother went back to high school .
how long you here for ?
just for stefan &apos;s b @-@ day .
aww . you mean you didn &apos;t come all this way to see me ?
heh . that &apos;s it , damon .
after a century , i finally realized
death means nothing without you .
do me .
aw , why are you so mean to me ?
uh , have you met you ?
you &apos;re not a nice person .
well , because i &apos;m a vampire .
but you &apos;re only the bad parts .
teach me to be good .
i &apos;m older , and that means stronger .
sorry .
don &apos;t ruin my time with stefan ,
&apos;cause i &apos;ll hurt you .
and you know i can do it .
yeah .
you leavin &apos; ?
dad doesn &apos;t like it when i stay here too much .
because he misses you , or because he doesn &apos;t trust me ?
your father &apos;s problem is he lacks imagination .
he thinks i fill your head with all my witchy juju .
he &apos;s right .
he &apos;s always right . that &apos;s his other problem .
uh @-@ uh . you need to be wearin &apos; that .
i gotta get it back to caroline .
it doesn &apos;t belong to me .
yes , it does . it was your ancestor &apos;s ,
and now it &apos;s yours .
emily was your ancestor , too . why don &apos;t you wear it ?
it didn &apos;t find me . it found you ,
protected you .
a witch &apos;s talisman is a powerful tool .
don &apos;t be givin &apos; that back to anybody .
i just wish it was prettier .
you &apos;re wallowing .
so are you .
my wallow is legitimate .
i was dumped .
yeah . well , logan &apos;s a jerk .
you didi &apos;t get a brushoff e @-@ mail
saying , &quot; i &apos;m leaving town . see ya . &quot;
wanna keep it down over there ?
why ? what are you doing ?
homework .
since when do you do homework ?
i gotta finish this . i &apos;m way behind ,
and i have a quiz tomorrow , so ...
what do you think ?
alien ?
some sort of replicant .
he can hear you .
yeah ?
send him in .
mr. salvatore , come on in .
uh , could you get the door for me ?
sure .
i understand from mrs. lockwood
that your uncle &apos;s out of town .
yes , he is .
um , but i spoke with zach .
he filled me in and asked if i could bring this to you .
vervain .
that &apos;s all we have at the momt .
i hope it &apos;s enough .
it &apos;s a small circle--
founding families , a few city officials .
and your deputies , of course , right ?
are we any closer ?
i think our facts are wrong .
we &apos;ve always believed that vampires
can only come out in the dark .
what if that &apos;s changed ?
is--is that even possible ?
we &apos;ve exhausted every other option .
we have to consider the vampire
may be walking around during the day right in front of us .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
we &apos;re now looking at anyone
new to town since the deaths began .
should turn up a suspect or two .
and i of course will do anything i can to help .
you up ?
no .
no .
no .
why haven &apos;t you called me back ?
i &apos;m sorry .
are you gonna stay in there forever ?
yep .
move over .
i &apos;m officially worried .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m tired of thinking , of talking .
can i get a one @-@ line version
so i can at least pretend be helpful ?
stefan and i broke up .
i &apos;m so sorry .
are you ok ?
right . stupid question .
i know i &apos;ve been kind of m.i.a.
when you need me the most .
i suck .
you wanna make it up to me ?
get my mind off of it .
just remember you asked for it .
uh , be patient .
i need to swear you to secrecy .
it &apos;s kind of a bad week for that kind of stuff .
swear , &apos; cause i &apos;m not supposed to be showing you this .
ok . i swear .
ok , there &apos;s no windows open , right ?
right .
there &apos;s no fan , no air conditioning .
none . what are you doing ?
grams just showed me this .
you &apos;re gonna love it .
you ready ?
bonnie , what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s true , elena ,
everything my grams told me .
it &apos;s impossible
but it &apos;s true .
i &apos;m a witch .
i believe you .
look , dungeon boy
i &apos;m done being your little slave girl .
you seriously hurt me , and i will be damned if you think--
oh , my god .
where have you been ?
it &apos;s really good to see you .
much better .
you wanna throw a party here at the grill tonight .
well , why don &apos;t you do it ?
because then stefan and his b.f.f. won &apos;t come .
i need a lot of people , big crowd . invite everyone .
and why am i having this party ?
because you are gonna help me solve this town &apos;s little vampire problem .
and i want my crystal back .
oh , but bonnie has it .
i know that .
get it from her .
so , this elena girl ,
she &apos;ll come around . i &apos;m sure of it .
have you had sex yet ?
no .
sex always works .
i mean , you &apos;ll rock her world so hard with your vamp sex
she &apos;ll be yours forever .
yeah , but see , this isn &apos;t about sex
or--or compulsion or any of our other tricks .
she has to want to be with me on her own terms .
wow . that sounded all mature and grown @-@ up .
well , i &apos;m not getting any older .
want some ?
no . thank you .
relax . i didn &apos;t kill anyone for it .
this phlebotomist i went out with a few times
he &apos;s my supplier .
oh , don &apos;t judge , ok ?
listen , i tried the animal diet .
lasted 3 weeks .
doesn &apos;t matter .
&apos;cause if i started again , i just--i don &apos;t know .
if you could stop .
lexi , i &apos;d never judge you .
i &apos;m just jealous of your restraint .
i have none .
i delight in hedonism .
speaking of which ,
what are we doing tonight ?
funny you should ask .
well , i wasn &apos;t asking you .
there &apos;s a party at the grill . you &apos;ll love it .
banquettes , tacky wait staff .
all of stefan &apos;s friends .
yeah , don &apos;t want a birthday party .
well , it &apos;s not for you . it &apos;s a party party .
no one &apos;s gonna know it &apos;s your birthday
caroline &apos;s throwing it .
damon , stay away from caroline .
we &apos;re friends . it &apos;s cool .
it &apos;s important for the town to see us
out and about like normal folk .
we need to blend .
i prefer mine at 98.6 .
let &apos;s go .
please ?
it &apos;s weird , huh .
after all this time joking about being psychic ,
i really am a witch .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m a freak now , do you ?
no . of course not .
uh , bonnie , i just-- i don &apos;t understand , though .
if your grams asked you to keep all this a secret ,
why did you tell me ?
you &apos;re my best friend .
i can &apos;t keep secrets from you .
i &apos;m almost ready .
can &apos;t believe you actually think
that we should go to this thing .
it &apos;s not i &apos;m asking you to run outside
midday without your ring .
i mean , seriously , it &apos;s a party .
a party that damon wants to go to , you know .
so my question is , &quot; why ? &quot;
i think he &apos;s up to something .
who cares ? i mean , what can he possibly do
in front of all those people in a public place ?
he knows how to keep a low profile , believe me .
ok . so he &apos;ll behave .
come on . one day a year , i get you ,
one day that you &apos;re not brooding
and existing in your own head .
it &apos;s my birthday , yeah ?
it &apos;s my day , and that guy
that jumped naked in the trevi fountain
and got unun on the torch of the statue of liberty ,
that guy can take a break from all
of his worrying from one night .
and go to a stupid party .
so quit your whining ...
and go get ready .
fine .
it &apos;s open. come on in .
oh , my god .
how , uh ...
who ...
uh , i &apos;m elena .
who are you ?
lexi , a friend of stefan &apos;s .
is he here ?
he &apos;s in the shower .
um , do you wanna wait ?
no .
i &apos;ll tell him you stopped by .
that &apos;s ok .
are you out of your freaking mind ?
what are you talking about ?
i just met elena .
you have some serious explaining to do .
you have some serious emotional damage .
no , it &apos;s not what you think .
she &apos;s not katherine .
then they &apos;re related , because they could be twins .
i don &apos;t know .
you don &apos;t know . you--you didn &apos;t find out ?
no . maybe i don &apos;t wanna know 。
i have--i have no desire to tie elena to katherine .
ok , yes , yes , the--
the resemblance is what drew me in ,
but that &apos;s it .
katherine and elena may look the same on the outside ,
but on the inside , they are completely different .
oh , so elena &apos;s not a raging bitch then , huh ?
no .
no , elena is ...
elena &apos;s warm ,
and she &apos;s--
she &apos;s kind , and she &apos;s caring ,
and she &apos;s selfless ,
and it &apos;s real .
and honestly , when i &apos;m around her ,
i--i completely forget what i am .
oh , my god .
you &apos;re in love with her .
yeah , i am .
amazing party , right ?
glad you thought of it .
well , are you having a good time ?
do you have my crystal ?
no .
then i &apos;m not having a good time .
where &apos;s my brother ?
said he &apos;d meet me here .
buy you a ...
what are you doing here ?
um , lexi said that you came by
and you--you seemed upset .
right .
the girl in the towel .
the towel ?
oh . no , no .
no , no , no , no . um ...
not like that . no .
uh , she &apos;s not exactly a girl . lexi &apos;s--
um , she &apos;s 350 years old .
you mean she &apos;s a ...
and she &apos;s my oldest friend .
nothing romantic .
ever .
ok , well ...
she kept staring at me .
it was weird .
well , you know , i &apos;ve talked about you
a lot , so ...
guess she felt like she knew you .
so why &apos;d you come by ?
i , uh--
it was a mistake .
elena , talk to me .
i can &apos;t .
stefan , i can &apos;t , and that &apos;s the problem .
i &apos;m keeping all these secrets from everyone .
i can &apos;t even tell my best friend .
do you know how hard that is ?
it &apos;s like i need to talk to someone ,
but the only person i can talk to is you ,
and ...
i want you to know
that i will always be here for you .
you can come to me about anything , ok ?
well , thank you for coming by .
hey , do you need a ride to the grill tonight ?
are you going to caroline &apos;s party ?
lexi &apos;s dragging me .
and ...
it &apos;s my birthday .
really ?
happy birthday then .
thank you .
actually , i , um--
i think i &apos;m gonna stay in tonight .
ok .
well , have-- have a good night .
bonnie !
hey , i &apos;ve been looking for you .
i &apos;m totally sorry to do this .
i know it &apos;s so indian giver
and i know we &apos;re not even supposed to say that anymore ,
but i need my crystal back .
why ? you said you hated it .
then i saw it on you
and i realized how great it is .
and i &apos;ve got , like , 3 outfits i can coordinate it with , so--
i can &apos;t give it back to you .
ok .
uh , well , i didn &apos;t want to have to tell you this
but i &apos;m your friend . when you wear it ,
it makes you look fat .
there . i said it ,
but it &apos;s because i &apos;m your friend , so--
i &apos;m sorry . caroline , i can &apos;t .
well , what do you mean
that you can &apos;t , bonnie ? it &apos;s mine .
i thought you said it was damon &apos;s .
well , it is .
so he &apos;s the one who really wants it back ?
no .
maybe . just--
are you wearing polyester ?
you were really gonna pull it from my neck ?
what the hell is wrong with you ?
matt .
just hear me out ?
please ?
i was just trying to help vicki . uh ...
i went through something similar once .
i &apos;m really sorry .
don &apos;t be .
it &apos;s not the first time she &apos;s run off .
turns out vicki &apos;s just like her mother .
i can &apos;t count on either of &apos; em .
thanks for trying .
where is it ?
bonnie won &apos;t give it to me .
so rip it off her neck .
i tried . it shocked me .
damn it .
why does it do that ?
i need that crystal .
why are you being like this ?
i &apos;m so good to you , and i &apos;d do anying , you know ?
it &apos;s just some stupid necklace .
no .
you are the only stupid thing here .
and shallow .
and useless .
ok , i &apos;m gonna need a little more foot movement .
yeah ,
i &apos;m not really-- not really interested in making a fool out of myself .
come on . you &apos;re not that bad .
do me a favor . tell me if you see damon with his camera phone .
right .
where do we going ?
no one is gonna see us here .
did you hear something ?
no . it &apos;s cool .
there &apos;s no one coming down here .
nice !
stefan smiles .
alert the media .
you haven &apos;t given him a lot of reasons to be happy lately .
oh , you &apos;re right . poor stefan .
persecuted throughout eternity by his depraved brother .
does it get tiring being so righteous ?
humph . it flares up in the presence of psychopaths .
ouch . well , consider this psychopath &apos;s feelings hurt .
what did you do to my brother ?
i &apos;m gonna need a less vague question .
when you did what you did to jeremy &apos;s memory of vicki ,
what else did you do to him ?
you asked me to take away his memory
of fangs and rowr and all the bad stuff .
you wanted me to take away his suffering .
but he &apos;s acting different .
he seems ok with everything , and a little too ok .
i mean , he &apos;s studying . he &apos;s not doing drugs . he &apos;s not drinking .
are you sure you didn &apos;t do something else ?
elena , i took away his suffering .
caroline
don &apos;t talk to me .
don &apos;t do that . let me explain .
well , what is there to explain , bonnie ?
ok , you got what you wanted , yeah ,
and something that doesn &apos;t even belong to you , by the way .
and i get called , a shallow , useless , waste of space .
who said that to you ?
well , who do you think ?
you know that &apos;s not true .
don &apos;t let him treat you like that .
yeah , as opposed to how my best friend treats me .
two shots of tequila .
make that three .
you know , i need to see some i.d.
no , you don &apos;t .
that &apos;ll be , uh--
free .
on the house .
thanks .
ah , the famous elena .
towel girl .
i &apos;ve been called worse .
here .
i didn &apos;t know that you guys could drink .
oh , yeah . it helps curb the cravings ,
but makes for a lot of lushy vamps .
you know , i &apos;ve never seen stefan drunk .
he always seems so ...
uptight ?
yeah . yeah .
but not with you .
well , that &apos;s the benefit of knowing someone for over 100 years .
you can just be yourself .
yeah , he can &apos;t be himself with me .
well , not yet .
the first step was him telling you .
the rest comes with time .
you seem so sure .
the love of my life was human .
he went through what i imagine you &apos;re going through--
denial , anger , et cetera .
but at the end of the day ,
love really did conquer all .
are you gonna drink that ?
oh . no .
go for it .
i &apos;m scared .
but you &apos;re here ...
&apos;cause you &apos;re crazy about him .
i get it , ok ?
i mean , what &apos;s not to love ?
listen . take it from someone who &apos;s been around a long time .
when it &apos;s real , you can &apos;t walk away .
hey , lexi .
it was really nice meeting you .
yep , i drank yours . sorry .
thank you .
you weren &apos;t supposed to be listening .
i was feeling epic .
whatever .
keep this contained .
that &apos;s not all .
did you see what did this ?
tell me everything you saw .
hi .
hey .
you came .
i couldn &apos;t miss your hundredth and whatever birthday .
i slim-- i &apos;m slipped .
i slipped .
hammered , huh ?
well ... a very nice but not handsome bartender
was very kind to me tonight .
unlike the rest of the global humanverse .
are those curly fries ?
coffee for the drunk girl .
bad night , huh ?
baddest .
am i shallow ?
heh . is that a trick question ?
i don &apos;t mean to be .
i--i wanna be deep .
i wanna be , like , the abyss deep .
no offense , care ,
but deep &apos;s really not your scene .
that &apos;s true .
i &apos;m shallow .
i am worse than shallow .
i &apos;m a kiddie pool .
you &apos;re not a kiddie pool .
you &apos;re not a kiddie pool .
can i just go home ?
yeah .
ok .
i &apos;ll take you . come on .
hey , you &apos;re ok .
she &apos;s all right . hold still . hold still .
all right .
what happened ?
is she ok ?
like you care .
she &apos;s drunk ?
as a skunk .
are they serving you in there ?
uh , i &apos;ll take her home .
it &apos;s on my way . i haven &apos;t been drinking .
i would appreciate that , matt . thank you .
you and i will discuss this later .
mmm . can &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t let anybody else leave .
all right , the shots are a bribe .
i need you to answer a question .
what are you really doing in mystic falls ?
have you tried the brittle ? it wins awards .
cut the crap .
ok .
i have a diabolical master plan .
what is it ?
well , if i told you , it wouldn &apos;t be
very diabolical , now , would it ?
ok , look around .
let me know if you see him .
what are you doing ?
thank you for the vervain .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me .
oh , my god .
what is it ?
excuse me . excuse me .
can &apos;t go out this way .
shh . shh .
why ?
it &apos;s part of the plan .
you ok ?
thank you .
get it in the car quickly .
lady , i checked everyone &apos;s i.d.
yeah , apparently you didn &apos;t .
pretty handy with that stake , damon .
it just , uh--reflex .
i guess the adrenaline kicked in .
this nightmare is finally over .
yeah . caught a lucky break with that witness .
without her , you wouldn &apos;t have been able to i.d. the vampire .
very lucky .
well , thank you again .
you &apos;re welcome .
you gonna be ok ?
no .
do you ever feel like there &apos;s not a person
in the world that loves you ?
life can be a little rough .
i just wish ...
what ?
wish that life was ...
different .
yeah . me , too .
please ...
don &apos;t leave me alone .
stefan .
stefan .
he killed her .
he killed zach .
he killed tanner . he turned vicki .
i have to kill him .
no . you can &apos;t do that .
why are you trying to save him , elena ?
he &apos;s never gonna change . don &apos;t you see that ?
he &apos;s never gonna change .
i &apos;m not trying to save him .
i &apos;m trying to save you . you have no idea .
what this will do to you . please , stefan .
everywhere that i go , pain and death follow .
damon follows me .
no more .
stefan , please . please , just--just talk to me .
let me be here for you . talk to me .
no .
you were right to stay away from me .
told you i &apos;d take care of it .
come on . i did this for you
to get &apos; em off our trail .
you never do anything for anyone but yourself .
you missed .
no . you saved my life .
i &apos;m sparing yours .
we &apos;re even .
and now we &apos;re done .
