i found this on him .
he kenw my mother .
have you seen this man ?
what &apos;s he wanted for ?
kidnapping .
show this to charlotte . it &apos;s one of my father &apos;s journals ,
or at least my version of it .
there is one person i wish to welcome her into the fold ...
amanda clark .
you and your new family were all over the news .
i &apos;m committed to our child .
i just don &apos;t think i can commit to you .
it &apos;s me . god , gordon , please be okay .
i love you .
some think intuition is a gift .
but it can be a curse as well .

a voice calling to us from places
that are better left unexplored .
an echo of memories that will never die
no matter how hard we try to kill them .
so ...
reconsidered my apology ?
you found my mother .
received at 1 : 21 a.m.
it &apos;s me . where are you ?
um , some guy claiming to be a detective lasky
came by with a sketch , asking questions .
i know what i &apos;m supposed to do .
what , that &apos;s your mother &apos;s voice ?
and i checked .
detective lasky doesn &apos;t exist .
where did you go yesterday , aiden ?
how did you find the flight recorder ?
i lifted a key off
your would @-@ be killer &apos;s body before you knocked me out .
look , if the woman on that message really is your mother
and she &apos;s as deeply involved with the man
who killed your father as it appears ,
the initiative are gonna be all over her .
this detective lasky is probably one of them .
all the more reason i need to find her .
and tell her what ?
have you thought how she might react
when she finds out that gordon &apos;s dead ?
i didn &apos;t kill him .
and if she asks me ,
i &apos;ll have no problem telling her who did .
right , will that be before or after you tell her
who you really are ?
or maybe she &apos;ll save you the trouble by recognizing you .
think , emily .
this woman has the power to
destroy everything you came here to do .
we don &apos;t know what her motives are .
the white @-@ haired man had nearly 20 years to brainwash her
into believing anything he wanted .
that--that is exactly the point i &apos;ve been trying to make .
before you track her down ,
you better be prepared for what you might find .
em--
this is a terrible idea .
bringing the initiative back into our lives
is a recipe for disaster .
well , perhaps you should &apos;ve thought of that
before you made then broke a deal
with one of their deadliest assassins .
and it &apos;s not an invitation , in any case .
it &apos;s a summons .
oh , and it has to be you ?
is that worry i detect in your voice ?
yes , it is .
worry that you will screw things up
like everything else you lay your reptilian hands on .
as much as i &apos;d like to send you in my stead , my dear ,
i need you here ,
dealing with what &apos;s truly important ,
like planning our wedding .
morning , all .
where are you off to ?
client meeting in palm beach .
due to recent events , some of our high @-@ rolling investors
are a little jittery .
and you &apos;re going to calm their nerves ,
get in some face time ?
good strategy , dad .
well , thank you for the vote of confidence .
it &apos;s in short supply around here .
well , don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll hold down the company fort while you &apos;re gone .
why is there a man installing a camera outside my bedroom ?
ah , that &apos;s a necessary evil , my dear .
i mean , there are worst places to be imprisoned .
oh , you mean like the rehab you locked me up in ?
i was referring to
your mother &apos;s little hideaway in the woods .
i will see you in a few days .
charlotte ,
just before the press conference ,
you told me that amanda knew the truth about her father .
what did she tell you ?
she didn &apos;t tell me anything .
it was all in the journal my dad kept while he was in prison .
i &apos;d like to see it .
i &apos;m sure you would , but it belongs to amanda .
you &apos;ll have to ask her .
good morning .
morning .
where are you off to ?
uh , daniel will fill you in .
uh , and ... after he does ,
do me a favor , and don &apos;t take your eyes off him until i return .
given the way he was blatantly licking my boots at breakfast ,
it &apos;s pretty obvious he &apos;s up to something .
then rest assured , i &apos;ll find out what it is .
okay .
yeah , yeah , yeah . anytime today .
we &apos;ll be here . thanks . bye .
that was the city inspector .
it &apos;s ... d @-@ day .
no kidding .
where are you going ?
did you mean what you said last night ?
you don &apos;t have to move out .
i said i &apos;m committed to our son .
but not to me .
and since him and i are one and the same , at least right now ...
amanda , wait .
for what , jack ?
exactly .
amanda , i made up the guest room for you .
you can stay as long as you want .
what were you thinking
by forcing that witch to publicly embrace me ?
or--or is this
just your way of getting jack to dump me once and for all ?
no .
then what ?
they killed your father . i get it .
but your obsession with making everyone pay
is ruining lives ,
namely my baby &apos;s .
my mother &apos;s still alive .
what ?
i @-@ i thought she died when you were a kid .
so did i.
but for ...
some reason , my father lied to me .
victoria &apos;s the only person left
who could possibly tell me where she is .
oh , my god .
i needed you to put my father &apos;s journals on her radar .
hopefully ...
what i wrote in them will be enough to get her to crack .
right on cue .
answer it .
uh , hello .
amanda ,
it &apos;s victoria grayson .
i trust you &apos;re well .
i am , thanks .
i &apos;d like to invite you to come over to our home this evening .
there are a couple of things that you and i need to discuss .
how about 6 : 00 ?
i can make that work .
wonderful .
oh , and , amanda ...
would you mind bringing over the journal that you shared with charlotte ?
i can do that . i will see you at 6 : 00 .
till then .
looks like you &apos;ve hooked your fish .
this wouldn &apos;t be so painful
if you kept better records .
some of this unopened mail dates back six months or more .
only luddites use snail mail .
go right in , ms. thorne .
hi . sorry to interrupt .
and here we were , not even speaking of the devil .
emily , you remember padma .
of course . hello , padma .
nolan , do you have a minute ?
i &apos;ll just get started on all this mail .
she &apos;s cute .
you think ?
don &apos;t you ?
so to what do i owe the pleasure ?
you hardly ever write . you never call ...
were you able to hack into the graysons &apos; security system ?
unless you need something .
turns out the software their security company is using
is proprietary to a subsidiary of nolcorp .
i &apos;d say you got lucky , but i know better .
now you can monitor ... boris and natasha &apos;s every move .
voila .
and what about the remote earwig ?
let me guess .
playing sock puppet with amanda again ?
can i help ?
i &apos;ve got everything under control .
but thank you , really .
nolan , i found something you need to look at .
another love letter from the i.r.s. ?
no .
it &apos;s from your father &apos;s estate attorney .
what &apos;s it say ?
it says his belongings are being held in storage
and will be auctioned off if not claimed .
why didn &apos;t you tell me he died ?
because this is the first i &apos;m hearing of it .
uh , let &apos;s get back to work , shall we ?
why are you blowing up my phone , porter ?
i gave you your take .
yeah , and i &apos;m giving it back .
the stuff we stole the other night , i need it , now .
maybe you don &apos;t get how this works .
i don &apos;t know what happened ,
but the guy has my i.d.
he comes by last night ,
says he &apos;s gonna go to the cops if i don &apos;t get him his stuff back .
so what &apos;d you do with it ?
you left your i.d. ?
you think this is funny .
i covered your ass . you understand ?
you gotta help me .
look , i can &apos;t .
the guy who sells the stuff that we stole ,
he &apos;d break our legs just for asking .
there &apos;s nothing i can do .
new friend ?
no .
what &apos;s all this ?
i got a problem , jack .
i want you to know
that whatever issues you and i may have had ,
i loved your father very much .
you and i both know there &apos;s more to that story .
you may have had my father fooled ,
but you don &apos;t fool me .
don &apos;t piss her off .
not yet .
read her the first passage .
&quot; i &apos;ll never forget the night victoria and i met .
&quot; new year &apos;s eve , 1991 . &quot;
&quot; in her eyes , i saw kindness and fire
and something else--
a deep sadness to match my own .
it had been two years since i had said good @-@ bye to my wife .
and the pain of that loss was as crippling on that night
as it was the day i laid eyes on her for the last time . &quot;
let &apos;s cut to the chase , shall we ? how much ?
for the journal . how much ?
i don &apos;t want your money .
then pray , what do you want ?
i want to know about my mother .
read her the next passage .
&quot; the only person to whom i ever confided the truth about kara
was victoria . &quot;
what truth is he talking about ?
all i know is what he told me .
that your mother died in a mental institution
when you were a very little girl .
perhaps a similar fate awaits you .
did you ... ... meet her ?
no ,
and if you think i &apos;m going to fall prey to your emotional extortion ,
you are sorely mistaken .
tell me everything you know about my mother ,
and i will give you this journal .
all i can tell you
is that your mother
was the source of all of david &apos;s pain .
now ...
if you don &apos;t care to share his writings ,
that &apos;s your prerogative .
but you &apos;re family now .
and it &apos;s my hope that one day you will share them ,
if not out of respect for me , out of love for your father .
mom .
amanda . what &apos;s going on ?
we were just discussing amanda &apos;s baby shower .
what baby shower ?
well , the one that we &apos;re throwing for her tomorrow .
it &apos;s impromptu , i know ,
but i thought it would be a fun way for you
to celebrate being an aunt .
say yes .
and i would love to welcome ...
we need another pass at her .
amanda into my public circle .
yes .
i feel like the luckiest girl in the world .
daniel .
i thought you went home .
i thought you did , too .
what are you still doing here ?
final details on the dubai teleconference in the morning .
you ?
same .
uh , my laptop froze .
i was just ... using my dad &apos;s computer
to print these out for the call .
all right , enough .
can we just be honest with each other ?
haven &apos;t we always been ?
i &apos;m worried .
ever since you shared your suspicions about the ransom ,
i keep thinking , if conrad were engaged in some impropriety ,
couldn &apos;t we all be implicated ?
not if get to the bottom of it first .
and whatever he &apos;s done , i promise ,
he &apos;s gonna be taking sole responsibility for it .
and you would do that , turn on your own father ?
what , you think he wouldn &apos;t do the same to me or charlotte
or you ?
hey , hey , hey . we &apos;re-- we &apos;re closed .
um , there &apos;s--there &apos;s a bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast
about 20 miles east ...
oh , you again .
odd time to be closing up shop .
the season &apos;s just getting started .
what &apos;s odd is , you were an american the last time you were here .
i work for the fbi . deep cover , same as gordon .
i know his feelings for you
ran beyond professional obligation .
where is he ?
his last communique indicated
his identity had been compromised .
his direct orders were to return here .
why should i trust you ?
the people gordon was infiltrating are incredibly powerful .
you need to tell me whatever you know
about whoever he &apos;s been in contact with .
i &apos;m gonna stick to the plan , his plan .
good @-@ bye .
sorry , ms. clarke .
but i cannot let you do that .
you &apos;re awfully quiet this morning .
i just keep thinking about what you said to me last night ,
about being implicated in what my father &apos;s done .
i just don &apos;t want to see you get dragged into it .
into what ?
my parents , they &apos;ve destroy people .
you can &apos;t imagine what they &apos;re capable of .
i have a pretty good imagination .
you can trust me .
look , the kidnapping .
it wasn &apos;t real .
the money my father pretended to pay in ransom
was actually used to inflate investor returns .
but that could bring down the entire company .
you gotta trust me .
i &apos;ve got a plan .
are you gonna get that ?
no .
the man &apos;s called me three times today
to confirm the eastern exposure on his palm beach hotel suite .
you should get dressed . we &apos;re late .
what is this ?
it &apos;s proof that victoria knew my mother .
she visited her in the hospital .
it &apos;s signed charlotte clarke .
why would victoria admit
to signing in under a different name ?
leave that to me . i &apos;ll do the talking .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m up for this .
amanda , please .
look , if we do this , if i find my mother ,
we can be done .
you will never be done .
please . i need you to call victoria .
tell her that you &apos;ve reconsidered .
tell her that you &apos;ll take the money for the journals
and ask her to write you a check for $ 100,000 .
what do we need her money for ?
we don &apos;t need her money .
we need her signature .
where are you going ?
to think .
what can you tell me about a lawsuit zingstur.com
brought against you in 2001 ?
you ever hear of them ?
no .
that &apos;s because they lost .
end of story .
you all right ?
yeah .
whew . i gotta get some air .
you know the original owners
fought 20 years for the right to develop this land ?
only to see their dreams
of turning this swamp into a thriving metropolis
burst like a proverbial bubble .
they put in all the work .
you buy on the cheap
and reap all the benefit .
it &apos;s a zero @-@ sum world , mr. grayson .
one man &apos;s loss , another man &apos;s gain .
we appreciate you coming on short notice .
i didn &apos;t realize i had a choice .
you always have a choice .
it &apos;s whether or not you &apos;re able to live with your choices
is the question .
so i take it you &apos;ve been watching the news very closely
since your agent went rogue , taking my wife hostage .
yes .
yes , a curious betrayal after decades of
loyal service to the organization .
he &apos;s been making subsequent threats ,
and i fear for my family .
i need assurances that you can control him .
as far as we &apos;re able to discern , he &apos;s off the grid ,
but rest assured , we will find him .
and when we do , we &apos;ll be most interested
in hearing his side of the story .
we &apos;ll be in touch .
so you got my message ?
i did .
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you . i wasn &apos;t happy to hear it .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry we , uh ,
couldn &apos;t get all your stuff back ,
but ...
this should put a dent in it .
it &apos;s $ 2,500 .
that doesn &apos;t even cover the watch band
your brother stole .
tell me what it &apos;s all worth . i &apos;ll make it right .
the watch , the babe ruth ,
everything they took--
you &apos;re looking at $ 20,000 minimum .
i can file an insurance claim .
that &apos;d mean involving the police .
no , no , i ...
i &apos;ll get it .
it &apos;s just ...
the bar has been closed . i &apos;m not that liquid .
but we got inspectors coming today ,
so ... once we reopen ,
i should be able to start paying you back .
i will give you one month , hmm ?
i mean , hey , i know where you live , right ?
hello . right this way .
emily .
come in . come in .
is amanda with you ?
she &apos;s not here ?
uh , no ,
and i &apos;m starting to worry mom &apos;s responsible .
you never know with her .
truer words ...
emily .
i had no idea you were invited .
well , i am the baby &apos;s godmother , so ...
oh , really ?
isn &apos;t that a religious tradition ?
i didn &apos;t take amanda for being a god @-@ fearing woman .
she doesn &apos;t fear much .
certainly not tardiness , huh ?
wow . swanky .
i told you , my sister &apos;s family is loaded .
hope we didn &apos;t hold things up .
not at all .
i see that you &apos;ve brought your , uh , people .
we used to work together .
everyone at the club wanted to come ,
but murray wouldn &apos;t let us take off at the same time .
and what kind of club is that ?
not bridge , i can tell you that .
twins ?
just the one .
shall we ?
yeah .
victoria grayson is a liar .
there &apos;s no way gordon did the things
she &apos;s accusing him of .
i agree .
i think he &apos;s being set up by the group he &apos;s embedded with .
what group ?
american initiative .
you may remember them from your husband &apos;s trial .
gordon told me everything about you , kara .
you need to trust me .
the initiative , they came after me .
gordon got to me first .
but they were going after victoria , too .
he saved her from them .
listen , listen , kara ,
i think i can help gordon , okay ?
but i need to find a link to his captors
so that i can track him down .
are you--are you sure that he didn &apos;t leave anything ,
you know , a c--a computer , a phone , papers ?
there &apos;s a portable hard drive in the safe behind the counter .
i &apos;ll unlock it for you .
he said if anyone ever came by
knowing the things that you know ,
that i should hand it over right away .
it &apos;s mostly codes and addresses ...
dates .
hopefully , you can make sense of it
before it &apos;s too late .
thanks .
time to open gifts .
to the great room , shall we ?
i &apos;m gonna use the little girls room .
do you mind saving me a seat ?
of course .
so does anyone know any shower games ?
girl , do i.
nice touch ,
bringing your girls from the beaver dam .
if i had to suffer another one of her parties ,
i thought i &apos;d at least spread the pain around .
i guess this means you &apos;re not gonna help me .
that &apos;s the other good thing
about the girls from the club ...
they &apos;re a great distraction .
so how &apos;s it look ?
can i tell my employees
they have a job to come back to tomorrow ?
afraid it &apos;s not gonna be that simple .
mold &apos;s still an issue .
wh @-@ what do you mean ?
we spent weeks scraping that stuff off the walls .
but you forgot the ceilings and the subfloor .
you need to use an e.p.a. approved contractor
for additional mold remediation .
how much is that gonna cost me ?
usually about 20 bucks per square foot .
oh , you gotta be kidding me .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s over--
over $ 40,000 .
great . now we can &apos;t pay kenny .
where have you been ?
i &apos;ve been at your father &apos;s storage unit .
my nani never wanted me to come to america .
the week i landed a job interview at j.p. morgan ,
she caught a nasty flu .
my parents sent a ticket , urged me to fly home ,
but ...
i was afraid if i asked them to push the interview ,
i &apos;d lose the job .
three days later , she was gone .
regrets suck .
where is it ?
i &apos;ll drive you .
who the hell are you ?
the truth this time .
i &apos;m not the enemy . i can tell you that much .
you &apos;re making a mistake , kara .
you made the mistake .
gordon would never have told anyone
i was once kara clarke .
which means you are either working for the graysons
or you &apos;re working for the initiative .
because you sure as hell aren &apos;t working with my husband .
whoever it is ,
you better hope they send someone .
gordon chose this remote spot very carefully .
when i come back ...
it &apos;ll either be with gordon ...
or not at all .
security , please .
yes , there &apos;s an unauthorized car
in a grayson global reserved spot .
a silver lexus .
thanks .
you heard from my dad today ?
just long enough to convince him not to rent yankee stadium
for the investors &apos; softball game .
ashley , i just got a call from security .
they said you &apos;re parked in an unauthorized spot .
i parked where i always park .
i &apos;ll be back .
received today at 9 : 08 a.m.
looks like i missed a call from you .
i assume it has to do with daniel .
i &apos;ll be back tonight ,
but if you have something on him , call me .
for your baby shower .
it goes with your real gift .
oh , my god .
you shouldn &apos;t have .
but i &apos;m so glad you did .
then i am , too .
last but not least .
it &apos;s a baby journal .
open it .
十万美元整
um ... that is , uh , so beautiful ...
and appropriate .
thank you .
amanda , are you all right ?
just , uh , kind of exhausted suddenly .
well , would you like to lie down ?
yeah . maybe for a moment .
charlotte , would you escort the ladies to the conservatory
for petits fours and refreshments ?
shall we ?
i knew you were a smart girl .
excuse me .
i &apos;m glad you changed your mind , amanda .
tell her you have and that she can have the journals .
you can have the journals .
well , once i receive them , i &apos;ll sign the check .
go for it . make her squirm .
actually , you don &apos;t need to do that .
then what are we doing here , amanda ?
you said that my mother died in an institution .
this is the visitors log from the hospital where she was committed .
my aunt charlotte signed in
a few days before my father &apos;s arrest .
i assume you have a point .
my aunt was an invalid .
she couldn &apos;t walk , much less write .
i had my suspicions about who forged the signature ,
but i never knew for sure until now .
&quot; amanda clarke . &quot;
&quot; charlotte clarke . &quot;
they match .
what happened when you visited her ?
this is pointless .
either you show yourself out or i will have you escorted .
go after her .
why were you there , victoria ?
what did you do to her ?
oh , let it go . if your father were here ,
he would tell you the same thing .
my father told me she was dead . why would he lie ?
but why ?
why would he make me believe she was dead
when she was obviously still alive ?
because he was trying to protect you .
so am i.
find out where she is .
yeah , but from what ?
amanda ?
he would rather have you believe that she was dead
than to tell you the unspeakable truth .
what ? tell me .
amanda . damn it .
your mother tried to kill you .
that &apos;s a lie .
i wish it was .
and no matter how much hatred you harbor toward me ,
it is the absolute truth !
marta !
someone , call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 !
what happened ? what happened ?
oh , my god . amanda .
amanda .
amanda .
yes , we need an ambulance right away .
oh , oh , god .
hang in there , amanda .
help is on the way .
20s , pregnant female ,
blunt head trauma ...
whatever-- whatever happens ,
you have to save the baby .
make sure they save the baby .
no , you &apos;re both gonna be fine .
take this . call jack , please .
i &apos;m going with her .
are you family ?
i am .
i &apos;m her sister .
charlotte .
mom , i &apos;m going .
closing .
we failed the inspection .
what are you telling me exactly ?
that you can &apos;t keep to your word ?
i &apos;m saying that this place is my income ,
so if i can &apos;t open the bar ...
maybe there &apos;s some other arrangement that could be made .
jack , i ...
maybe there is . i ...
艾米莉
excuse me .
oh , thank god .
jack , it &apos;s amanda .
there &apos;s been an accident .
what ?
is she okay ?
i don &apos;t know .
they took her to suffolk memorial .
i &apos;m gonna meet you there , okay ?
yeah .
hey , listen , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s my girlfriend .
i gotta ... i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;ll work something out .
what up ?
you did good .
so did our inspector .
cool . did you make an offer on the bar ?
after the dust settles .
let &apos;s get started .
阿曼达 · 克拉克 十万美元整
victoria !
what the hell happened ?
victoria , where are the children ?
they &apos;re safe .
it &apos;s amanda clarke &apos;s blood . she fell .
on our property ?
you better hope it &apos;s not serious .
it &apos;s very serious , no matter what her fate .
just before the accident ,
she confronted me with some old log @-@ in sheets
from her mother &apos;s hospital .
she &apos;s very close to figuring out that
i hand @-@ delivered kara to gordon murphy .
how could she have stumbled upon that ?
she couldn &apos;t have , not without help .
oh , welcome home , dad .
good trip ?
listen , i &apos;m wiped . i &apos;m gonna-- i &apos;m gonna turn in , all right ?
okay .
okay ?
you ...
didn &apos;t call me back .
because there &apos;s nothing to report .
daniel only has your best interests at heart .
and as for me , i am done being your little spy .
who knew there was such a thing as competitive tetris ?
i led a petition to make it a demonstration sport
at the &apos; 92 olympics .
we lost .
i can &apos;t believe he held on to this .
hey , this is all nolcorp stuff--
investor prospects , start @-@ up budgets .
i founded the company
in my dad &apos;s garage the summer before my junior year .
when i told him i wasn &apos;t going back to school ...
mm , he kicked me out .
i should sort through it all .
could be useful for the audit .
padma ...
thank you for ...
taking an interest .
you didn &apos;t have to .
it &apos;s my job to take care of you .
&apos;cause ...
i was kinda hoping maybe this had ...
nothing to do with the job .
can , uh ... we try that again ?
i think we should .
and finally , in society news ,
amanda clarke ,
daughter of terrorist david clarke
and a recent addition to victoria grayson &apos;s family fold ,
has been rushed to suffolk memorial
with serious but unspecified injuries .
amanda clarke was apparently
at the graysons &apos; southampton estate at the time of the accident .
amanda clarke &apos;s family ?
that &apos;s us . that &apos;s us .
i &apos;m amanda &apos;s ...
i &apos;m the father .
how are they ?
the abruption &apos;s caused a decrease in blood flow to your son .
he &apos;s being deprived of oxygen .
the longer we wait to deliver , the worse the outcome .
then why are you waiting ?
it &apos;s high risk . amanda &apos;s already lost a good deal of blood .
and we just don &apos;t have a conclusive assessment of her internal injuries .
obviously , we &apos;re gonna try to save mother and son ,
but if there comes a point where a decision must be made--
