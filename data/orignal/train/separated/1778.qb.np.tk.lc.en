猫中之王
hey , so i saw a movie trailer the other day .
how could batman possibly fight superman ?
i mean , isn &apos;t that dumb ?
maybe he uses kryptonite .
有令氪星人失去超能力等多种功效
well , batman &apos;s got a lot of money .
maybe he builds a suit that can do everything superman can do .
no , no , no , no , no .
i &apos;ve seen that movie . it &apos;s called iron man .
what is happening ?
i don &apos;t know .
but it &apos;s beautiful .
and now ben affleck is batman ?
oh , he was great in shakespeare in love .
ooh , we should watch that next girls &apos; night .
we could do a double feature
with the leonardo dicaprio romeo + juliet .
oh , i love me some leo .
and it &apos;s gone .
oh , hello , everyone .
i am happy to report i &apos;m feeling much better .
good for you .
my fever is gone , my sinuses are pressure @-@ free ,
and my mucus is as clear as a yosemite waterfall .
glad to hear it .
i &apos;ll be able to return to work tomorrow .
yay .
well , why isn &apos;t everyone happy ?
your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again .
you really don &apos;t know why ?
no .
but i knew that his &quot; yay &quot; was sarcastic .
not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement
sounded like rain on a roof .
let me refresh your memory .
penny ,
rub vicks on my chest .
sheldon , i cooked you breakfast .
i made your bed .
i checked your mouth for thrush .
you can rub your own chest .
oh , sure , grope every other male on the planet ,
but draw the line with me .
i brought you a little care package from work .
it &apos;s our latest antiviral
and the best decongestant we make .
i hope laughter is the best medicine ,
&apos;cause this care package is a joke .
hey , she came all the way here ...
you &apos;re gonna want to take these with food .
sheldon , stop being a baby
and let emily take a look at you .
she &apos;s a dermatologist .
i went to medical school .
well , in that case , try removing the irritating patch
of brown skin standing next to you .
all right , here you go .
leonard , i &apos;m dying .
you &apos;re not dying . it &apos;s just the flu .
i asked for chicken noodle .
this is chicken and stars . it &apos;s killing me .
i never did get that chicken noodle , did i ?
hi , sheldon .
hello .
are you feeling any better ?
physically , yes , but i &apos;m upset
because everyone &apos;s mad at me for no good reason .
why don &apos;t you tell me what happened ,
and in a gentle , loving way ,
i &apos;ll explain to you why you &apos;re wrong .
you know how , when you &apos;re sick ,
you &apos;re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want
and other people &apos;s feelings don &apos;t matter ?
gentle and loving-- this is gonna be tricky .
i had a 101 fever .
if that &apos;s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones , when is ?
sheldon , when you &apos;re sick , you can be ...
unbearable .
that &apos;s why your friends have been known
to work late or sneak out to the movies
or stay at a neurobiology conference
three days after it &apos;s ended .
you stayed in michigan all week to avoid being around me ?
no , no , not just that .
i mean ...
detroit is beautiful when it &apos;s sleeting .
you know , i &apos;m not the only one
who &apos;s unpleasant when they &apos;re sick .
when penny got food poisoning , she threw up so loudly
i could barely hear the television .
ooh , i just heard something .
might be hail , might be gunfire .
either way , i &apos;m gonna go take pictures . bye .
hey , stuart .
hey . where &apos;s sheldon ?
still sick ?
no , he &apos;s fine .
we just needed a little break .
yeah , i get that .
when i brought him his comics the other day ,
he said , &quot; oh , great , death is literally at my door . &quot;
he was being a jerk to everyone .
don &apos;t take it personally .
oh , i &apos;m on so many antidepressants ,
i couldn &apos;t if i wanted to .
i wish we could do more stuff without sheldon .
i wish that all the time .
usually before i blow out birthday candles .
you know , amy took some time off from him .
really improved their relationship .
okay .
as long as it doesn &apos;t end with us having coitus with him ,
i &apos;m in .
we should all take a trip or something .
you know , penny and i have been talking
about taking a weekend in vegas .
maybe we should all go .
bernie would love that .
maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there .
that sounds really fun .
yeah , that sounds fun .
a party @-@ bus party don &apos;t stop .
when i say &quot; party , &quot; you say &quot; bus . &quot;
no .
no .
no .
no !
so , the guys and i were talking about
renting a party bus and everyone going to vegas .
oh , that could be fun .
but just to be clear , you mean a party bus
with booze and music , right ,
not , like , juice boxes and video games ?
yes .
and howard &apos;s birthday was a drop @-@ off party .
you didn &apos;t have to stay .
well , i &apos;m in .
when are we going ?
this weekend .
oh , where are we going ?
well , vegas , but ...
ugh , atlantic city without the taffy ?
no , thank you .
that &apos;s fine , &apos; cause actually you &apos;re not invited .
well , now ... well , that &apos;s hurtful .
oh , sheldon , you don &apos;t even like it there .
i can consider a place america &apos;s urinal cake
and still enjoy the occasional visit .
not this time .
oh , fine . then i &apos;ll just hang out with wolowitz .
he &apos;s coming , too .
well , then raj and i will ...
nope .
very well . stuart .
oh , great . do that .
ugh . stuart .
hi , sheldon . what &apos;s new ?
our friends are jerks , and i &apos;m mad at all of them .
i said , &quot; what &apos;s new ? &quot; but sure .
can you believe they planned a trip
to las vegas and didn &apos;t invite me ?
did you refuse to apologize
and act like they were stupid for being mad ?
you know , i liked it better when there was still
a little mystery left in our relationship .
everyone tried to take care of you ,
and you were nothing but mean to them .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re not on my side .
i was on your side when someone stole your car radio .
who else &apos;s side could you have been on ?
i don &apos;t know .
a music @-@ loving hobo with a heart of gold ?
sheldon , i understand that you &apos;re upset
because you feel left out ,
but i don &apos;t know why we &apos;re even talking about this .
just apologize to them .
fine , if that &apos;s what it takes to go on their dumb trip .
maybe you could try apologizing
because you actually feel bad .
it &apos;s called empathy .
it &apos;s something you could work on .
i have empathy .
watch .
leonard made me soup , and i was mean to him .
great .
now try it as if this isn &apos;t your first day as a person .
fine .
leonard made me soup , and i was mean to him .
hey , i felt a little something .
let me try again .
leonard made me soup , and i was mean to him .
i was mean to him .
he must have felt terrible .
oh , now i feel terrible .
neat !
glad i could help .
now let me see you feel bad for lying
and staying in detroit longer than you needed to .
i feel so , so bad .
hey , we &apos;re both great at this .
leonard , get ready for an apology .
and with the added twist of an m. night shyamalan movie ,
i &apos;m going to mean it .
ah , so like every other
m. night shyamalan movie i &apos;ve seen ,
you spoil it in advance .
hey , if you didn &apos;t know bruce willis was dead the whole time ,
that &apos;s not on me .
okay .
here it comes .
you tried to take care of me when i was sick ,
and i was mean to you .
there &apos;s no excuse for that .
and i &apos;m truly sorry .
thank you .
i appreciate that .
i want you to know that that is sincere .
i @-@ i do feel bad .
i &apos;m not just saying it to be included on your trip .
appreciate that , too .
terrific .
now all that &apos;s left is for you to invite me to come .
me to ask , &quot; are you sure ? &quot;
you to say , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
and then me to bring it home with ,
&quot; how could i say no to that face ? &quot;
you &apos;re still not coming .
what ? but i apologized and i meant it .
i know that we don &apos;t play this game very often ,
but you &apos;re doing it wrong .
sheldon , i accept your apology ,
but you upset a lot of people while you were sick .
i &apos;m not in a position to just say you can come .
well , all right .
what if i apologize to all of them ?
fine , if you apologize to everyone ,
they all say it &apos;s okay , then yes , you can come .
challenge accepted !
sounds like it &apos;s time for the sheldon cooper apology tour .
well , i hope it &apos;s as much fun
as the sheldon cooper spell @-@ checks local menus tour .
my goodness !
do you remember &quot; comes with apsparagus &quot; ?
howard and bernadette ,
you tried to comfort me when i was ill ,
and i treated you terribly .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m impressed .
no , no , no , wait . i &apos;m not done .
allow me to underscore my sentiment
with a haunting rendition
of brenda lee &apos;s &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot;
played on the pan flute .
apology accepted !
forgiven , forgiven !
all right , that &apos;s eight hours of practice down the drain .
and to memorialize this occasion ,
here are your commemorative t @-@ shirts .
&quot; sheldon cooper apologized to me &quot; &quot;
&quot; and he made it all better . &quot;
all you did was offer
maternal care and affection ,
and all you received in return
was rude and insensitive behavior .
can this wait ?
i &apos;m afraid it can &apos;t .
the trip is tomorrow .
and i have more apologies to make .
okay , fine , i accept your apology , now get out !
wonderful . would you mind holding up this shirt
while i take a quick ... ?
leonard !
you brought me my comic books when i wasn &apos;t feeling well .
that @-@ that was thoughtful .
and i was insensitive .
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you , sheldon .
i appreciate that .
and i want you to know that i mean it , you know ?
this isn &apos;t me just wanting to go on the trip to las vegas .
what trip to las vegas ?
the one everyone &apos;s taking this weekend on the party bus .
of course , i wasn &apos;t invited .
that would be my understanding .
on a less painful subject ,
what size t @-@ shirt do you take ?
raj , you were being a good friend ,
and my illness was no excuse for my behavior .
i hope that you can accept my apology .
of course i do .
and , emily , i &apos;m sorry for saying
dermatologists aren &apos;t real doctors .
and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re tired of hearing that .
do you honestly think i hear that a lot ?
well , i would imagine when your job is popping zits
and squirting botox into old lady faces ...
okay !
okay , the point is
that we accept your apology .
uh , maybe you do .
he just insulted me again .
yeah , but he doesn &apos;t mean it .
why are you defending him ?
i believe i can answer that .
uh , like me ,
raj is demonstrating empathy .
now , why don &apos;t you accept my apology ,
receive your free t @-@ shirt , uh--
i hope extra small is okay .
for some reason wolowitz took a medium .
well , i don &apos;t accept your apology .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s called standing up for myself .
you should try it some time .
fine , how about this ?
you &apos;re making me uncomfortable
by prolonging this ridiculous fight ,
and i wish you &apos;d stop .
oh , you want me to stop ?
no problem .
no , come on , please don &apos;t leave !
point of clarification-- are you still going on the trip ?
because if not ...
don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re good .
i caused that fight , i feel terrible .
wait , i can do that better ...
i caused that fight .
i feel terrible .
yeah , wow , i don &apos;t know which one i like more .
so , was the fight really bad ?
no .
as a fight , it was excellent .
she used harsh language and slammed the door .
although as i say this ,
that might not have been what you were asking .
you think they &apos;ll still go on the trip ?
all i know is after the fight i went to emily &apos;s to smooth ...
they &apos;re not going on the trip .
no .
what is wrong with you ?
look at him , caring about what &apos;s wrong with me .
that is some top @-@ shelf empathy .
hey , well , we should start a club .
you went to emily &apos;s to apologize .
and when you left , she was crying .
that is true .
well , i suppose i should apologize again .
is she okay ?
yeah , i calmed her down .
but she &apos;s not going to vegas if he &apos;s going .
wait , that &apos;s an option ?
i didn &apos;t know that was an option .
well , that is fine , because i &apos;ve decided
that i won &apos;t be joining you .
i &apos;ve realized that the most genuine way
to demonstrate the remorse i feel is
to let you have this weekend to yourselves .
that &apos;s very mature of you .
well , i &apos;ve been on a little trip myself recently .
not to sin city but to sincere city .
where instead of genital warts , the only growth
you &apos;ll come back with is personal growth .
and there &apos;s your next t @-@ shirt .
ooh , check out the stripper pole .
you know what that means .
that raj &apos;ll be on it before we make it to the freeway ?
you know it !
this is so cool .
let &apos;s have champagne !
well , i would like to propose a toast
to a well @-@ deserved weekend of ...
what are you doing ? !
my plan was to jump out at the state line ,
but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet .
you couldn &apos;t give us just one weekend ?
i told him this was a bad idea .
what do we do-- kick them off ?
if we drop them off at a fire station ,
they have to take them ; no questions asked .
before you do , please give me one more chance
to apologize to emily .
oh , god .
emily , as i &apos;m sure you know ,
i &apos;m considered an odd fellow .
but what you don &apos;t know is that ,
while i often say the wrong thing ,
in my heart i mean well .
i think that you are
a smart and wonderful woman , you know ?
and we all think that you
can do better than koothrappali .
you know , sheldon ...
shh , let him finish .
so , for all the times i &apos;ve offended you
and all the times that i &apos;ll offend you in the future ,
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
good .
then i &apos;ll be leaving now .
oh , it &apos;s okay , sheldon .
come with us .
oh , that &apos;s very kind of you .
but i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll all have a better time without me .
let &apos;s go , stuart .
but i want to stay .
stuart , now !
you know , i know he &apos;s a jerk ,
but i actually feel bad for him .
and now you see the problem .
come on , you pain in the ass !
that &apos;s me !
bye , stuart .
wait !
i &apos;m a pain in the ass , too !
are you relieved that you and raj
were able to patch things up ?
at the moment ?
no , not really .
shake it , baby !
work that thing !
