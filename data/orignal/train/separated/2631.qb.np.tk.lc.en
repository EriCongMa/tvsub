this is the third one this month .
i &apos;m well aware of that .
i wasn &apos;t brought on to this .
i thought we agreed that we just suppose to find them .
things change , lloyd .
i need you to be more careful .
are you telling me how to do my job ?
i &apos;m warning you .
one or two more of these experiments goes south ,
and someone &apos;s gonna get wind of what we &apos;re doing here .
and you &apos;re being well compensated
to take on that risk , lloyd ,
but if you &apos;re telling me that you &apos;d rather not continue ,
we will find somebody else .
is that what you &apos;d prefer ?
license and registration , please .
evening , officer .
evening .
sure . no problem .
what are you hauling here ?
produce .
and , uh , where to ?
sanborn .
sanborn , huh ?
are you aware that this highway &apos;s
a drug @-@ smuggling route into ontario ?
i wouldn &apos;t know anything about that .
good , then you wouldn &apos;t mind me
taking a look in the back of the vehicle , would you ?
you want to remove the sheet , please ?
what the --
don &apos;t --
honey , what &apos;s wrong ?
you left your cane .
i didn &apos;t need it .
for the first time in ...
i don &apos;t know how long , char ,
i just got up and walked .
just a few steps . hurt like hell .
the treatment ?
it &apos;s working .
after the attack , i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d ever be the same ,
and after the diagnosis --
and you heard what the doctor said --
tumor &apos;s shrinking .
and it &apos;s working .
hey , don &apos;t hang up . i &apos;m in trouble .
the judge cleared you of everything .
it &apos;s not about the harbormaster .
i can &apos;t .
look , when reddington blew my cover ,
he exposed me to some very dangerous people ,
and now they &apos;re looking for me .
and the guy who places me , i can &apos;t get in touch with him .
tom ...
and these people , these germans --
hold on .
get in .
where the hell you been ? how &apos;d you find me ?
if i can , they can .
they flagged you leaving dresden .
your passports are burned .
throw me the bag ! get in !
all right , look , i got to go ,
but i &apos;ll be all right .
we got to leave !
i know ! give me a second !
now !
i know what today is .
have fun at wing yee &apos;s tonight .
goodbye , tom .
what &apos;s this ?
you don &apos;t remember , do you ?
what ?
the grapevines .
the ones you and sam harvested .
of course . i @-@ i remember .
along the garden fence , we would pick ...
is this from --
a bottle of wine you made with sam when you were a child .
happy birthday , lizzy .
you &apos;ve become everything sam dreamed you would and more .
share it with someone special .
that said , it &apos;s probably undrinkable by now ,
so i also brought you an &apos; 82 brunello as a backup .
31 .
no offense , but that &apos;s old .
my yogi tells me that time doesn &apos;t exist .
he fully intends to live forever ,
and tragically , he &apos;s not the only one .
tell me , what do you know
about the longevity initiative ?
i haven &apos;t heard of it .
it &apos;s a private company
dedicated to extending human life indefinitely ,
funded by none other than roger hobbs .
the tech billionaire ?
yes .
he started years ago .
i know because he offered me the opportunity
to invest as a founding partner in the project .
i passed .
you know roger hobbs personally ?
roger is considerably smarter than the above @-@ average bear ,
and now ... it appears he may also be as deadly .
you &apos;re aware of the new york state trooper
who was gunned down last night in the line of duty ?
the suspect &apos;s still missing ,
but they found mutilated bodies in the back of the truck .
not mutilated .
experimented on .
the longevity initiative
has entered the human @-@ trial phase .
if they &apos;ve made a breakthrough , they need to test it .
on innocent victims .
with any luck , i &apos;ll be dead @-@ wrong .
perhaps you &apos;ll have a better sense
once you &apos;ve spoken with roger hobbs .
sorry to bother you at home .
actually , the longevity initiative
does not have any dedicated office space .
we fund research all over the world .
how many employees ?
about a thousand .
all doing research on immortality ?
sounds like science @-@ fiction , i know ,
but it &apos;s all grounded work .
we have a goal -- to solve the death riddle .
to do that , we target the issue from every angle .
we support unproven advanced genetic technologies
that the mainstream establishment won &apos;t even touch .
simply put , we are trying
to extend the life of the human body as long as possible .
how about we talk about the three dead bodies ,
all with craniotomies ,
found being smuggled in the back of a truck ?
what are the chances
that we connect those dead bodies back to you
and your , uh , experiment ?
you can &apos;t possibly think
one of my scientists was responsible .
there is speculation that some of your employees
might have thought it was time for human trials .
i mean , look , i have enough lawyers on speed dial
to fill a stadium .
i &apos;m here talking to you
because this project means everything to me .
we have nothing to hide .
we &apos;ll need a list of all of your researchers .
done . you have my full cooperation .
that was the m.e. &apos; s office .
we have to go . thank you .
thank you for your time .
you were right --
these people were experimented on .
all three victims died during a neurosurgical procedure .
for what purpose ?
unclear .
but foreign cells were introduced into their brain tissue .
what kinds of cells ?
well , some of them were fetal stem cells ,
but some were , well ...
not human .
bizarre .
when the bodies came in ,
they all had catastrophic damage
to the frontal lobe of the brain .
naturally , i thought that damage
was caused by whatever experiment led to their death ,
but then , i got an i.d. of one of the victims , and ...
so , the experiments didn &apos;t cause the brain damage .
no .
you &apos;re looking at william eckhoff .
he was in a skiing accident ,
suffered multiple bone fractures ,
but most importantly , a traumatic brain injury --
couldn &apos;t speak .
in fact , he was reported missing three days ago
from a care facility in hagerstown .
who would abduct a defenseless , disabled man
and subject him to such cruelty ?
what did you do ?
why am i looking at my patients on every newscast ? !
i could care less about your patients .
i murdered a cop .
i don &apos;t believe this .
i told you if we kept going , we &apos;d attract unwanted attention .
i &apos;m gone .
i &apos;m leaving the country . you do the same .
i can &apos;t do that .
i have to go . i &apos;m with a patient .
well , then ...
let &apos;s continue .
tell me your name , please .
there we go .
let &apos;s try that again .
tell me your name .
tell me your name .
come on , you can try harder .
tell me your name , please .
tell me your name !
that &apos;s it . tell me your name .
get in here ! she &apos;s seizing !
is this a bad time ?
of course not . have a seat .
you look good , harold . how have you been feeling ?
much better , actually ,
thanks in part to you .
thank you , tom .
you &apos;re welcome .
so , what is it that brings you by ?
it came to my attention that a couple of your people
paid a visit to roger hobbs .
came to your attention .
are you monitoring our investigations now ?
easy , harold . it &apos;s not like that .
this hobbs a friend of yours , then ?
he &apos;s a friend of ours .
his companies hold multiple defense contracts .
he &apos;s one of the good guys .
why do i need to know this ?
i &apos;m sensing some defensiveness .
it sounds like you &apos;re suggesting that all of this information
should somehow impact my investigation ,
which can &apos;t be true
because we &apos;ve known each other too long
for you to cross that line .
i &apos;m not crossing any lines .
i &apos;m just passing along some background .
that said , all things being equal ,
i &apos;d like to see this guy given the benefit of the doubt .
all things are never equal .
listen , harold ,
you should do what you think is right .
i certainly hope that nothing i &apos;ve said would imply otherwise .
we were all heartbroken
when we heard about what happened to william .
we were mortified when we thought
he might have wandered away under our supervision .
are you saying he was abducted ?
we think so , yes .
i imagine you must have some security measures in place .
would you be able to provide us with a list
of people who had access to the facility the day he disappeared ?
i &apos;ll get that for you right away .
and where was william last seen ?
the south yard .
diane , one of our best caretakers ,
was taking the patients out for some air .
william was sitting with john paul .
diane said she turned away for just a few moments
and when she looked back , he was gone .
may i talk to john paul ?
you can try , but he &apos;s not very communicative .
looks like a good hand you &apos;ve got there .
8 &apos;s open .
i &apos;m elizabeth . i &apos;m with the fbi .
i was wondering if i could ask you some questions
about william eckhoff ?
you were with him when he disappeared , am i right ?
the people i work with -- we &apos;re looking for him .
is there anything you can tell us ?
did you see anything ?
was there anyone else there with you that we could speak to ?
thank you for your time .
any luck ?
no . you ?
security log the day of the disappearance .
everyone on site was authorized to be here .
&quot; gold crown pharmaceuticals . &quot;
lloyd munroe . he &apos;s one of their reps .
he visited one of our physicians that afternoon .
does that mean something to you ?
gold crown pharmaceuticals ?
is that what you &apos;re trying to tell me ?
hey , guys , what you got ?
a birthday card and 31 red @-@ velvet cupcakes .
well , 30 . i couldn &apos;t resist .
when are you coming back ?
aram , the suspect .
work . right .
okay , lloyd munroe ,
37 years old of north beach , maryland .
no criminal history .
i just called gold crown .
they said he didn &apos;t report for work today .
i &apos;m running his phone and financials now .
i &apos;ve got something .
one of the other victims was a patient at landover hills .
guess which pharmaceutical rep was there
the morning he disappeared .
lloyd munroe .
that &apos;s got to be our guy . that can &apos;t be a coincidence .
let &apos;s bring him in .
that might actually be a problem .
according to his recent credit @-@ card activity ,
lloyd munroe just bought a bus ticket out of buffalo
on the silver line .
get the local p.d. on the line .
tell them they need to stop that bus .
you know , not everyone &apos;s so anxious to leave .
put a flag on tom , all his known aliases ,
he hasn &apos;t left .
you don &apos;t know that for sure .
has he reached out to you ?
no .
he &apos;s a murderer , keen .
just &apos; cause he got off doesn &apos;t change that .
i don &apos;t even know where he is .
i &apos;ll drop you off at hilltop lanes .
there &apos;s a locker there -- b @-@ 15 .
tickets are in a go bag .
take the first flight you can to london .
mr. pitts will be waiting .
reddington just showed up . i don &apos;t know how .
it &apos;s not on reddington .
i didn &apos;t have a choice , bud .
i &apos;m sorry .
where &apos;s my gun ?
i &apos;m not going to london , am i ?
my uncle was a farmer .
he had a beautiful border collie --
smart , well @-@ trained , loyal as hell --
but one summer , that dog , he got into the hen house ,
killed half the chickens .
my uncle ...
loved that dog ,
but he knew he had to be put down .
i can go someplace far away from here .
you burned reddington for the girl ,
and i looked the other way .
and then there &apos;s dresden .
this is me !
you went to the feds for the girl , jacob .
you &apos;re gonna put a bullet in my head ?
after capetown ?
roll down the window .
i &apos;m not just some operative , all right ?
you know me .
you raised me .
you knew the rules , kid .
i warned you about the girl ,
and she &apos;s cost you your life .
you know what this is ?
it &apos;s the ballistics report that proves the gun you had on you
was the same one used to murder that cop .
killing a police officer is a capital offense .
that makes you eligible for the death penalty .
i don &apos;t know anything .
right , which is why we found you on a bus fleeing the country .
we want the people you work for .
give them to us , and we &apos;ll talk to the u.s. attorney ,
recommend a life sentence .
you do enough , you might even get the possibility of parole .
julian powell .
that &apos;s who paid me -- a doctor named julian powell .
paid you to do what ?
he needed test subjects ,
ones that fit very specific requirements .
people with frontal @-@ lobe damage .
and i was able to locate them because , as a drug rep ,
i had access to care facilities .
tell us about roger hobbs .
what &apos;s his connection to all of this ?
i don &apos;t know who that is .
if you &apos;re lying--
i &apos;m not lying .
i can help you .
i always deliver and pick up the test subjects
from the same place .
clinic &apos;s secure .
upon entry , our team encountered two unknown subs --
white males , mid @-@ 30s .
they appeared to be med techs of some kind .
they &apos;re in custody .
what about powell ?
not a sign of him , but what we did find ,
you got to see for yourself .
dr. maynard .
meet victim number four .
same profile as the others , unfortunately ,
but at least now we know what we &apos;re looking at .
we do ?
powell &apos;s been experimenting on patients
with a very specific and severe form of brain damage .
he &apos;s been injecting their brains with a collection of cells --
a combination of fetal stem cells and some kind of ...
foreign matter .
so , he &apos;s injecting their brains with jellyfish cells .
yes .
he &apos;s been keeping meticulous records ,
and jellyfish are at the center of all his experiments .
we should get those files over to aram as quickly as possible .
according to his notes ,
powell &apos;s focused on transgenic research ,
which is the transferring of genes from one species
into the genome of another .
look .
these two rabbits are sisters .
now , before their mother gave birth ,
powell removed the embryos that made them
and injected one with jellyfish dna .
he then inserted the embryos back into the mother .
do you see the difference ?
they look identical .
legitimate researchers around the world are doing this .
they &apos;ve made glowing cats , monkeys , cockroaches .
i mean , this is very impressive ,
but the new work he &apos;s doing ...
that &apos;s in here .
behold -- turritopsis dohrnii ,
known to modern science as the immortal jellyfish .
as far as we know ,
it &apos;s the only living creature on earth that never dies .
well , i mean , it &apos;s born and grows old like we do ,
but then , when it encounters environmental stress or assault ,
it reverses the aging process
until it &apos;s just a little polyp again .
how is that even possible ?
it has the amazing ability to change its own cells .
some say it &apos;s like a butterfly
that turns into a caterpillar that grows back into a butterfly
or a chicken that becomes an egg that hatches a new chicken .
so powell is using these jellyfish
to conduct experiments on human brains .
he must be trying
to regenerate the damaged brain tissue .
he wants our cells
to learn from the turritopsis dohrnii .
i mean , look , julian powell , clearly insane ,
if this ever worked ,
it would be a concrete first step
toward human immortality .
so , what do we know about this guy ?
he joined sadovo solutions in 2005 .
it was a biotech company in chapel hill .
mostly worked on the research side .
he was an endocrinologist .
why do you keep saying &quot; was &quot; like he died or something ?
because it &apos;s kind of like he did .
the guy &apos;s a ghost .
after he left the company in 2007,
he stopped paying taxes .
no residence on file , no active credit lines ,
and no medical- or
driver &apos;s @-@ license renewals in the last eight years .
he dropped off the face of the earth .
wait a sec . get this -- sadovo solutions ,
the biotech company that powell worked for before he disappeared ,
guess who owned it .
roger hobbs .
that &apos;s not enough of a link to secure an arrest warrant ,
but it &apos;s certainly enough to bring him in for another chat .
hey , big day . plans to celebrate ?
oh , uh , yeah ,
i &apos;m gonna go to wing yee &apos;s with a few friends .
no big deal .
restrain yourself , keen .
come on , smile .
it &apos;s your birthday . you got plenty to celebrate .
thanks . you &apos;re sweet .
you &apos;re not listening .
my lab was raided . the fbi took everything .
i am aware of that , julian ,
which is why you need to come in .
you authorized my research .
you knew what i was doing .
i authorized you to begin preliminary trials
for the purposes of second @-@ stage research .
i &apos;m on the verge of a breakthrough .
you &apos;ve seen the data .
you &apos;ve jeopardized the entire longevity initiative ,
not to mention putting me
and everything that i have worked for at risk .
julian , you need to come in .
no .
this is bigger than you , roger .
this is bigger than any of us .
this has become a serious problem .
it &apos;s not easy being god .
you got any idea how much this guy &apos;s cost me ?
not just his work , but the security .
there &apos;s people out there that would pay a fortune
just to know his name and steal his research away .
what &apos;s it worth ?
hard to say .
a foot in the door to human immortality
on the open market ?
now i got to get rid of him .
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you , it hurts .
you know my feeling .
humans as a species are untrustworthy creatures .
we don &apos;t deserve to live forever .
what the hell were you thinking , roger ,
even to consider authorizing this powell
to conduct human trials ?
it was necessary
for the research to reach the next level .
i didn &apos;t know he was gonna be so reckless .
you had to know there was a risk innocent people would die .
how many innocents died
in the search for the smallpox vaccine ?
all in the name of the advancement of science .
this isn &apos;t about science , roger .
this is about you actually believing
that death is beneath you .
no , this is what it takes .
louis pasteur -- he wasn &apos;t even a physician .
the day that he injected
that first small boy with the rabies vaccine ,
he was risking criminal prosecution .
jonas salk injected the flu virus
into men in an insane asylum in michigan .
decade later ,
he &apos;s being hailed as the genius who cured polio .
i know of a doctor who agreed with you ,
a relatively young man also fascinated by genetics ,
a man who didn &apos;t concern himself with morality , humanity .
that was josef mengele .
i don &apos;t need you to agree with what i &apos;ve already done , red .
but i would like to know
if you &apos;re willing to help me now .
sir , there are two agents from the fbi at the front door ,
and they &apos;re insisting on seeing you right away .
i &apos;ll be right down .
the identity of my scientist --
everything you need to know to take care of the problem .
if it were anyone else , i &apos;d decline ,
but for you , roger ,
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
agent keen , ressler , come on in .
you are going to tell me !
you are going to talk ! you know that , right ?
is it reddington ? you work for him ?
because you are not cops .
if you &apos;re gonna do it , do it .
two bullets . get it over with .
no , no , no , that &apos;s not how we do things ,
not with boys like you .
everything ready ?
ja .
him first .
have you heard of the blood eagle ?
we cut the skin along the spine ...
pull the lungs out through the ribs ...
watch them flutter ...
like bloodstained wings .
it &apos;s actually quite beautiful .
that &apos;s a cute story .
i &apos;m not gonna talk .
okay !
elizabeth ...
keen .
you still not gonna talk ?
dr. levin , you have excellent timing .
i was intending to call you today .
well , i hope it &apos;s not because you &apos;re feeling worse .
no , actually , it &apos;s the opposite .
for the first time in a while , i feel like myself again .
this new drug you &apos;re testing --
i think we &apos;re really on to something .
dr. levin ?
i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m so pleased we &apos;re having success , harold ,
but to be honest ,
it makes this call all the more difficult .
the study is evolving , as these things do .
they &apos;re always looking at the results and the funding
and making adjustments .
what kind of adjustments ?
i heard today that they &apos;re lowering the age parameters
as we move into this next round of treatment .
no final decisions have been made ,
but i need to let you know ...
it &apos;s possible we won &apos;t be able to continue with the trial .
so , they &apos;re removing me from the program ?
no . we &apos;re still waiting on a decision ,
and i promise to do what i can to avoid any change .
i really am sorry , harold .
you know how i feel about you and charlene .
keep your mouth shut !
cut him open .
sarah hastings .
you son of a bitch .
and what about her ?
don &apos;t say a word .
i &apos;m not gonna say anything
until you guarantee me that you don &apos;t touch elizabeth keen .
what i can guarantee about elizabeth keen is ,
i &apos;m gonna find her ...
and i &apos;m gonna kill her .
she &apos;s fbi .
you a cop ?
no . i was married to one .
but not now .
why do you care ?
jacob , no !
someone in your group murdered sarah hastings .
oh , god .
i was hired to find out who .
powerful people are looking for you , elias .
if you want to know who ,
then you promise me you never , ever touch elizabeth keen .
you sell me out for that bitch ,
and i swear i &apos;ll hunt you down .
you need to let me go .
i can help you .
don &apos;t say another word .
you know that girl you said cost me my life ?
she just saved it .
we don &apos;t see a lot of billionaires
suspected of murder .
and you &apos;d be wise to remember that my client
hasn &apos;t been charged with anything , agent keen .
earlier today , we raided a clinic
being used to conduct experimental transgenic research
on human test subjects .
that research was being conducted
by a dr. julian powell ,
and you failed to mentioned your connection with powell
the last time we spoke .
what connection ?
he worked for you
at a biotech company called sadovo solutions .
and now he surfaces ,
abducting disabled patients , doing illegal experiments ,
killing people .
have you any idea
how many people i &apos;ve employed over the last 20 years ?
this is one hell of a coincidence , mr. hobbs .
we come around asking about human experiments ,
and when we find the man responsible ,
he has a direct connection to you .
he may have been an employee of mine many years ago ,
but i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ve absolutely no recollection of him .
and i &apos;m gonna guess you &apos;ve got nothing to suggest otherwise .
we &apos;re looking into every phone call , every correspondence ,
every shred of data that we can pull on julian powell
and that clinic .
if you &apos;re funding him , we will prove it .
what do you have ?
we &apos;ve got straight denial .
he &apos;s pretty much calling our bluff .
he say anything
we could use to connect him to powell ?
nothing of value , but it &apos;s early .
we &apos;ll keep at him .
if that &apos;s all we have , it &apos;s not enough to arrest him .
look , he &apos;s lying to us about powell .
we can make a circumstantial argument that he &apos;s involved .
if he is directly connected to powell
and we let him go ,
the first thing he &apos;s gonna do is destroy the evidence .
we should hold him .
you see that lawyer in there ?
he can afford that suit and the beach house he owns
because he &apos;ll never let that happen .
let him file .
by the time he gets heard ,
we &apos;ll probably have what we need .
what &apos;s going on , boss ?
i &apos;m just saying --
not all suspects are created equal .
look , if somebody told me that you were gonna say that ,
i &apos;d have bet every damn dime that they were wrong .
so , he &apos;s got friends in high places .
since when do you care ?
hey , if we don &apos;t have enough , go get enough .
but in the meantime , kick him loose .
maybe we can &apos;t connect hobbs directly with the victims ,
but i have a feeling dr. powell can .
all we have to do is find him .
i think i can help with that .
been going over the files we recovered from powell &apos;s facility ,
and check this out --
these are the test subjects ?
yes and no .
all of them are deceased except for one ,
the woman on the bottom right .
leann mcgrath -- 34 years old , currently a resident
of twin pines assisted @-@ living center in springdale .
powell &apos;s collected all of her medical files .
he &apos;s been tracking her condition for years .
she has the same frontal @-@ lobe condition as the others .
i have a feeling we just found
dr. powell &apos;s next test subject .
sweetheart , i &apos;m so sorry ...
but i failed you .
we need to go away from here .
don &apos;t worry . i haven &apos;t forgot your things .
julian ?
i wasn &apos;t expecting you today .
what &apos;s going on ? a @-@ are you taking her somewhere ?
todd , i don &apos;t have time to explain ,
but i need you to understand that ...
that this isn &apos;t personal .
we need you to escort us to leann mcgrath &apos;s room immediately .
yes , of course , agent .
what happened ? you okay ?
he took ms. mcgrath toward client pickup .
dr. powell .
let &apos;s go for a ride .
reddington !
i &apos;m sorry , but i don &apos;t know who the hell you are .
my name is raymond reddington .
i &apos;m the man who was sent by roger hobbs to ...
get rid of you .
relax , doctor .
i have no intention of killing you .
you are a potential solution to a problem .
how so ?
a young woman i know and care for
had a distant memory quite literally taken away from her
when she was a little girl -- erased .
so , you want to apply my work
to the field of memory extraction .
not your work , doctor -- your research .
if you &apos;ve been able to prove that brain cells can regenerate ,
with time ,
would your breakthrough relate in any way
to the restoration of this young woman &apos;s memory ?
no , my work will not help the woman remember .
in theory , transgenics can help rebuild
damaged memory synapses ,
but there &apos;s a more ...
there &apos;s a more fundamental problem .
and that is ?
let me show you .
you know julian powell ?
of course . she &apos;s his fiancee .
ms. mcgrath was in a car accident .
she suffered catastrophic damage
to the frontal lobe of her brain .
there &apos;s an article here about the accident .
i think it might have more of the story .
&quot; the car ms. mcgrath was riding in
jumped a center divide and hit an oncoming tractor trailer .
officers at the scene said ms. mcgrath &apos;s car
was being driven by her fiance julian powell . &quot;
this is where she lived .
it &apos;s all i have left of who she was .
i proposed in this room .
wasn &apos;t supposed to happen like that .
i had a more romantic plan ,
but once i had the ring , i couldn &apos;t help it .
six weeks later , she was gone .
we were in the hospital -- st. michael &apos;s --
and a good friend of mine and his wife were having a baby ,
and leann and i were in the maternity ward until 4 : 00 a.m.
it was one of the happiest nights of my life .
and then , in the car on the way home ,
we were both so tired .
yeah .
you fell asleep at the wheel .
so this is why he &apos;s been experimenting
on patients with frontal @-@ lobe damage .
he &apos;s not looking for immortality .
he &apos;s trying to bring back the woman he loves .
i suppose roger hobbs
doesn &apos;t care about your motives or practices ,
as long as he profits from your findings .
i needed money to fund my research ,
and it was the only way that i could fix what i &apos;ve done
and the only way that i could get leann back .
so , what did you say to him , doctor ?
told him that my work would help him live forever .
and he wrote a check that afternoon .
this is where i do most of my real work .
thousands of hours spent sitting here ,
just searching , planning ,
believing .
and ... for what ?
look -- look at this .
look at ...
useless .
you never found anything .
i lied , falsified the data .
i had to .
hobbes would have cut me off .
but none of this works . my research is a failure .
i am a failure .
i can &apos;t save her .
you killed a lot of innocent people , dr. powell .
i wanted to help them .
what life did they have ?
what kind of life can she have now ?
once again , police have identified the man
who died earlier today .
we can now confirm his name is dr. julian powell .
so far , we &apos;ve been unable to locate -
nicely done .
every station &apos;s calling it a suicide .
it &apos;s done .
and the fbi ?
nothing leads back to you .
why so dour , roger ?
i lost a lot of money on this , red .
tens of millions .
this has nothing to do with the money .
you wanted it to work .
for all you &apos;ve achieved ,
you actually thought this might be your legacy .
if it wasn &apos;t for you ,
my legacy would be life without parole .
well , maybe you didn &apos;t save mankind
from an untimely death ,
but someday , you may be able to spare me from one .
care to tell me what the hell happened today ?
i suppose i should .
you stole powell out from under us ,
and then an hour later , he ends up dead ?
did you kill that man ? !
i &apos;m happy to discuss the day &apos;s events ,
but not if you insist on doing so at this volume .
you gave us this case because you wanted powell ,
and then you used us to flush him out .
yes .
&quot; yes . &quot;
you wanted the science .
the science didn &apos;t work .
powell was falsifying his results .
he was never interested in immortality ,
but you know that .
he wanted to get his fiancé back .
he knew it was over ,
so he ended it .
that &apos;s the truth .
that &apos;s half the truth .
i don &apos;t take anything you say at face value .
fair enough .
my interest in powell &apos;s research was only half the picture .
this was always about roger hobbs .
i used the fbi to create a problem for roger .
i needed the man to be in my debt , and now he is .
roger hobbs is a murderer .
he may not have conducted those experiments ,
but according to the law , he is just as guilty ,
and now without powell , we can &apos;t prove it .
don &apos;t be so quick to make an enemy of roger hobbs .
you don &apos;t see it yet , lizzy , but a dark cloud is approaching ,
and when it arrives , roger hobbs will be a very good friend
at exactly the moment he needs to be .
harold , sorry to pull you away .
looking sharp .
i &apos;m on my way to some fundraiser --
another $ 5 piece of chicken for $ 50,000 a plate .
i have a feeling you &apos;ll be seeing
a lot more of those in the future .
heard things worked out for roger hobbs .
i &apos;m glad to hear it .
hey , i just came by
to clear the air about our conversation earlier .
i hope you didn &apos;t misconstrue my intent .
not a problem .
good .
i wouldn &apos;t want anything to come between us .
let me ask you a question --
i got a call earlier from dr. levin .
he said i might get cut from the trial .
you know anything about that ?
how would i know anything about that ?
but i wouldn &apos;t sweat it . i &apos;ll make a call .
that &apos;s what friends do .
what are you still doing here ?
i could ask you the same thing .
what happened to dinner ?
i just didn &apos;t feel like going out .
what &apos;s going on , keen ?
you said earlier that i had so much to celebrate .
you know that isn &apos;t true .
i mean , i though by the time i was in my 30s ,
i &apos;d have something to show for it .
i would at least be a prestigious profiler .
i mean , i was the top in my class .
i thought i &apos;d have a loving relationship with someone ,
maybe we would be raising a family together .
at least you &apos;ve got a dog .
that &apos;s one up on me .
i don &apos;t know who i am .
i don &apos;t know if this is my birthday .
i don &apos;t even know my own name .
no , i know who i am .
i am the puppet of some high @-@ functioning sociopath .
i don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m doing here .
what you &apos;re doing here
is celebrating your birthday with me .
what did you --
see , i called the restaurant .
i thought i &apos;d send you and your friends a bottle of wine .
turns out , there wasn &apos;t a reservation ,
so i figured since you weren &apos;t going to wing yee ,
♬ tonight we &apos;ll fly a while ♬
i was bringing wing yee to you .
♬ just give me the word ♬
♬ and hold on to me ♬
oh , look at you !
i &apos;ve been saving this for a special occasion .
♬ like i hold on to you ♬
well ...
i &apos;m honored .
♬ a steeple holds a bell ♬
♬ the night sky holds the moon ♬
♬ coverlets and down ♬
♬ will catch you when you fall ♬
i don &apos;t care how long it takes
or what expense you have to go to .
i want jacob phelps found .
shh ! shh !
what are you doing ? !
i didn &apos;t know where else to go .
