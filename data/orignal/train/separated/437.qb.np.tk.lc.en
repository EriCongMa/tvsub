not done !
if this is a sales call on a sunday morning ...
settle. it &apos;s me , jj .
i tried your cell. listen , something &apos;s come up .
you need to get down to the office pronto .
oh. you are kidding .
i know . i wish psychopathic killers
would be a little more respectful of our weekends , too ,
but what are you gonna do ?
is everything ok ?
um , no .
kevin and i got in a fight last night ,
and to self soothe , i drank a lot of wine .
and , jj , you know i can &apos;t drink wine .
why did i drink so much wine ?
you &apos;ll be fine .
no , i don &apos;t know .
&apos;cause right now everything is blurring. oh , my god .
my hair hurts. how is that possible ?
he &apos;s coming out of the shower .
i hate confrontation. it was such
a fight. i hate confrontation
then don &apos;t confront .
just kiss , make up ,
and get your butt over here .
what is this , grand central station ?
oh , god .
kevin .
i am so sorry about last night .
i should not have stormed out like that .
you stormed out ?
yeah .
you stormed out all last night ?
yeah .
what &apos;s , uh--
hey. you see we gotta go in , right ?
yes. y @-@ yes .
uh , jj just called me , too .
let &apos;s go .
my things .
mine and mine and--
this is yours .
this is mine .
see you there .
hey , let &apos;s go .
danny savino , the floor manager at the sapphire lady casino
in atlantic city was found dead in his office this morning .
blunt force trauma to the head .
an empty wallet
and money clip left next to the body .
mug shot. this guy &apos;s got a record .
savino was a member of the agnoli crime family
sorry. sorry .
they &apos;re active in the atlantic city area .
how &apos;s the head ?
not all the aspirins in all the pharmacies ...
it looks like a robbery gone bad .
why was the bau called in ?
8 one @-@ dollar bills surrounding an 8 card .
that &apos;s highly ritualistic .
and because savino has ties to organized crime ,
agents in new jersey are worried about things escalating .
well , it doesn &apos;t take much to ignite a mob war .
and collateral damage means nothing to these guys .
if we don &apos;t get a handle on this soon ,
innocent people will gonna die .
hey , honey , it &apos;s me .
listen , the most amazing thing is happening .
i &apos;m at the sapphire lady right now ,
and i am on a run you would not believe .
everything we ever talked about ,
it &apos;s gonna happen .
i &apos;ll try you again later , ok , honey ?
bye .
a chinese proverb says ,
&quot; at the gambling table , there are no fathers and sons . &quot;
no question . &quot; godfather ii , &quot; hands down .
no , no , gotta be &quot; scarface . &quot;
for me , &quot; the untouchables . &quot; spence ?
mm , probably &quot; le cercle rouge , &quot; the 1970s french classic .
but &quot; den tredje vaagan &quot; is definitely a close second .
yeah , that was my runner @-@ up , too .
what about you , rossi ?
best ever gangster flick .
i &apos;ve had too much of the real thing
to be a fan of mob movies .
garcia , did we get the crime scene surveillance video yet ?
no , sir , because there wasn &apos;t any .
that &apos;s not possible .
every inch of the casino is surveilled
every minute of every day .
yeah. apparently the footage was tampered with , so ...
all right . reid and prentiss , go to the crime scene .
dave , you and jj find out if savino was involved
in anything the local authorities don &apos;t know about .
morgan and i will contact the local fbi office
and arrange a ceasefire with the families .
yes ! yes ! yes !
it looks like the party &apos;s over here .
mind if i join ?
hey. there you are .
eddie ! that &apos;s my man. there you are .
gee , curtis. those all yours ?
oh , yes .
stay right here .
i &apos;ve got plans with you .
oh , you are on a hot streak .
too bad your old man couldn &apos;t see this , huh ?
hey , did you hear what happened last night ?
danny savino got his head bashed in. he &apos;s dead .
didn &apos;t you two--you two did some business together , right ?
you good to go ?
not anymore. yes , here we go .
winner--8 the hard way !
oh , yes !
thank you .
you look a little strung out , man .
when &apos;s the last time you got some sleep ?
oh , i don &apos;t know , man. a couple of days .
yeah ?
you would not believe
what &apos;s been going on with me , man. it &apos;s crazy .
so i was headed up north for a job interview .
a job interview ? what about the job you already got ?
yeah. i got fired .
how come ?
i punched out my boss. all right ?
but look , look , look. i stopped on
the turnpike , i
bam ! $ 250 instant winner .
so i jump in the car , i pop a u @-@ turn ,
i come right back here .
come on .
so i walk in the casino , it happens again .
i put a dollar in the slot machine ,
$ 500 payout .
and now this .
i am on the craziest roll. i &apos;m telling you .
if i get the buy @-@ in for that million @-@ dollar poker tournament
the day after tomorrow , i &apos;m telling you , i could win that .
listen , i could win that .
what have you been smoking ? that &apos;s a 50 @-@ grand buy @-@ in .
i hope you don &apos;t mind. i thought a
little celebration .
no , don &apos;t mind at all .
money well spent .
are we good to go ? everyone ready ?
trust me .
all right , shooter . all right , let &apos;s go 500 .
8 the hard way again .
you want me to blow on them ?
pile on , everybody .
please .
come on , be good to me .
electric strike lock. impressive .
and hard to bypass. if this was a robbery ,
the unsub must have slipped in right behind him .
but savino could have known the killer .
he could have let him in himself .
he wasn &apos;t expecting this to turn into a brawl .
you know , maybe the unsub wasn &apos;t either .
if this was premeditated ,
you &apos;d think he would have brought a knife or a gun with him .
the bowling trophy &apos;s more a weapon of opportunity .
is this the only camera ?
yes , ma &apos;am , but the disk was removed .
the casinos have a central terminal that backs up and stores
all surveillance footage , right ?
mr. savino didn &apos;t want that in his office .
he put in a personal camera .
so the victim bypassed a security system
that would have revealed his own killer .
what didn &apos;t he want anyone to see ?
vince repeti ?
who &apos;s asking ?
agent jareau. this is agent rossi .
we &apos;re with the fbi .
we understand you &apos;ve cooperated
with the bureau before when we &apos;ve needed information .
&quot; before &quot; being the operative word .
i &apos;m retired .
this is how you plan on spending your golden years ?
what can i say ?
some guys like to futz around with little golf carts ,
me , i love the ladies .
i hear ya .
me , i like to spend my time
chatting with my old friends
down at the new jersey parole board .
listen , we just need you to come out of retirement
long enough to tell us a little about danny savino .
he &apos;s dead now , so what the hell .
for 8 days and 7 nights of sheer heaven ,
afternoon massages on white sandy beaches ,
yes , you can win an all @-@ expenses @-@ paid trip to paradise .
but you can &apos;t win if you don &apos;t play .
but you already know that , don &apos;t you , curtis ?
you &apos;ve dreamed of this your whole life .
most people don &apos;t understand ,
but you &apos;re not most people .
are you , curtis ?
you don &apos;t think small .
you are not content with a small life .
all this is going to be yours , curtis ,
for you and your wife .
you just need to maintain your focus .
don &apos;t waver .
it &apos;s right there , if you can just win .
curtis ? curtis !
what are you doing ?
sorry , sweetheart ,
he &apos;s taken .
really ?
i &apos;m his wife .
all right , let &apos;s go. come here. come here .
i &apos;m winning , teri .
i &apos;m winning big .
you told me you were going to philly .
i was. but i stumbled onto this system .
i don &apos;t really understand it myself yet--
every week you got a new system .
we can &apos;t pay the mortgage. the bank is foreclosing on us .
but this-- this system works .
there &apos;s a big poker tournament
day after tomorrow .
million @-@ dollar winner take all .
the streak i &apos;m on right now , i could win that thing .
we &apos;d be rich .
and then i &apos;m done .
i swear .
i want a divorce .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m going to my sister &apos;s .
you--you show up here and you announce that ?
you &apos;re hurting me , curtis .
this is our dream. yours and mine together .
you &apos;re hurting me .
stay away .
i mean it .
we appreciate your cooperation .
agent goslin .
any luck with our mob bosses ?
well , i think we bought some time .
what about the crime scene ?
savino purposely bypassed the standard casino security .
and i think we know why .
danny savino supplemented his income
by loaning money to casino patrons .
it explains why he changed the camera in his office .
he didn &apos;t want his bosses to know he was freelancing .
so we &apos;re looking for a gambler .
a gambler in atlantic city .
that narrows the field .
you scared me .
sorry .
uh , we never got to finish that champagne .
pass .
i--i don &apos;t know what happened ,
but my luck is gonna turn around .
yeah , well , when it does , give me a call .
maybe--maybe we could go somewhere and--
i said no , ok ?
we came up empty tonight , both of us .
it happens .
i meant what i said about my luck turning around .
it &apos;s going to. i can sense it .
right. with that gambler &apos;s esp of yours .
you and all the other losers in this town .
hey , what are you looking for ?
discarded matches .
the victim had a freshly @-@ lit cigarette .
but there was no lighter or matches in her purse or the car .
our unsub lit it for her .
it means she wasn &apos;t afraid of him .
hey , garcia , you &apos;re on speaker .
patti riolo , aka francesca .
hometown , rice lake , wisconsin .
up until 3 years ago ,
she worked with a high @-@ end escort service in manhattan .
how high , you ask ? i will tell you .
nosebleed high .
$ 5,000 a night and up .
now she &apos;s trolling gaming tables in atlantic city .
i imagine that 5 grand a night window
was very short in her profession .
well , this is gonna turn into a circus real fast .
both residents and visitors to atlantic city
are on edge tonight as the circle of 8 killer
has apparently struck again .
no way. that &apos;s the hooker who was all over you last night .
they &apos;re saying the same guy killed danny savino .
you knew both victims .
that &apos;s weird .
my bad luck must have rubbed off on them .
listen , you gotta forget about teri .
she was holding you back .
every time she stuck her nose in things ,
your luck went cold .
hey , you could win that million @-@ dollar tournament
and then go to tahiti on your own , huh ? yeah !
live your dreams , man .
you know where we spent our honeymoon ?
where ?
some half @-@ assed motel in florida .
went to a theme park .
teri deserves better than that .
i promised her we &apos;d ...
go to tahiti .
i &apos;m gonna show you something , man .
you carry around a picture of a watch ?
you want something , you keep it close .
that &apos;s the dumbest thing i ever heard .
go ahead and make fun , but when i hit it big ,
that &apos;s the first thing i &apos;m gonna do ,
is buy that watch i just showed you .
then i want to see your face .
come on , man , first one &apos;s on me .
make your own luck .
come on .
4 aces ? your mojo is back big time !
you make a deal with the devil or what ?
winner , winner , chicken dinner .
hey .
we &apos;re looking for a man who &apos;s killing those
who appear to prey upon or take advantage of gamblers .
loan sharks and call girls so far .
the killings may have been triggered
by recent gambling lose .
our unsub is physically fit .
he was able to overpower danny savino ,
and patti riolo was killed with extreme violence .
it &apos;s doubtful this person has a criminal record .
he moves without fear of being recognized
in one of the most surveilled locales on the planet .
he wouldn &apos;t have elements of a domestic life , like children .
that would only moderate or
stabilize his compose behavior .
pathological gambling is the most common type
of impulse control disorder in the world .
and there is no more superstitious
creature on earth than gambling .
the number 8 is the ritual aspect to our unsub &apos;s signature .
it &apos;s a compulsion .
it could signify a birthdate
or an important time in his life .
not only is this unsub a killer but he &apos;s also an addict .
he &apos;s killed twice in the last two days
and he may not be able to stop .
thank you .
you jimmy ?
over here .
this doesn &apos;t make sense. danny savino was a bottom @-@ feeder ,
handing out nickel @-@ and @-@ dime loans to to small @-@ time gamblers .
but patti riolo was exclusively about high @-@ rollers .
the unsub wouldn &apos;t have naturally crossed into both worlds .
he &apos;d be in one or the other .
unless his fortunes changed drastically
between murdering savino and meeting up with patti riolo .
maybe he flashed the money he stole from savino
in front of her , pretended to be rich .
or he gambled with it and won big .
let &apos;s say dave &apos;s right. he was in financial trouble
and immediately after murdering savino , his luck changed .
in his mind , he could have connected the two .
every compulsive gambler believes in
a system , no matter how unlogical .
and he &apos;d figure the part of his
system he &apos;d been missing was murder .
dealer shows 21 .
21 for the house .
a cashier was shot to death last night
at a gas station in town. and get this--
$ 8.00 and an 8 card left on his body .
i don &apos;t get it .
i lost practically every hand .
hey , did you see that circle of 8 guy did it again ?
he gunned down some dude in a gas station .
something &apos;s off .
my system should have worked , but it ... didn &apos;t .
please tell me you didn &apos;t gas up your car last night .
what ?
savino , that hooker .
seems like this guy was only killing people who knew you .
anyway , too bad you didn &apos;t get the 50 grand for the buy @-@ in .
oh , no !
yo. you with me ?
uh , meet me outside. i gotta take care of something .
look at us , man .
top @-@ shelf whiskey to 5 @-@ buck hoagies one day to the next .
we &apos;ve been through it all , you and me .
hey. it &apos;s for you .
it &apos;s yours .
keep it .
mm @-@ hmm. you serious ?
yeah .
nice .
you were part of my system and didn &apos;t even know it , huh ?
well , you know what they say .
the reverse side also has a reverse side .
yeah. whatever the hell that means .
it means you &apos;re part of my system , too , eddie .
$ 88. the unsub &apos;s getting generous .
there &apos;s less rage than the others .
and undoing. there &apos;s evidence of remorse .
shot in the back so he wouldn &apos;t have to face his victim .
no robbery this time , either .
wallet &apos;s intact , except for anything to i.d. him .
is this even the same killer ?
the ritual &apos;s too similar to discount it .
the change in the m.o. makes sense
if the unsub is still refining his system .
maybe killing the cashier at the gas station didn &apos;t work ,
so he &apos;s back to the drawing board .
two 8s instead of one could also be significant .
i know in china the number 8 symbolizes prosperity .
the more 8s the better. as a matter of fact ,
in chungdu a telephone number consisting of all 8s
recently sold for over a quarter million dollars .
so why would he be doubling up on his luck out here ,
away from all the casinos ?
there &apos;s been another killing .
a guest in his room at the sapphire lady .
same ritual .
no. his neck was broken .
and he was robbed of 50,000 .
but the strange thing is ,
the killer left nearly 20,000 behind with the body .
garcia , is there a casino in the neighborhood
of penrose and morningside avenue ?
uh ... no casinos per se ,
but there &apos;s a private gambling establishment right on the corner .
is it legal ?
yeah. but it &apos;s ultra exclusive .
they have a monthly high @-@ stakes poker tournament ,
today being the day for the month , coincidentally enough .
or no coincidence at all .
what &apos;s the buy @-@ in ?
um ... yikies .
$ 50,000 .
but it &apos;s a million @-@ dollar guarantee if you win .
what time does it start ?
later this afternoon .
thanks .
forensics got a fingerprint match on the last victim .
eddie langdon. we &apos;re looking into him .
hey , any luck ?
no , they don &apos;t want to allocate agency funds for the buy @-@ in .
i &apos;m still working on it .
well , i can &apos;t imagine why not .
we &apos;re only asking for 50,000 bucks of taxpayer money
so that fbi agents can play texas hold &apos; em .
hey , what about you ?
what about me what ?
you could stake us the buy @-@ in .
yeah , you &apos;re a best @-@ selling author .
no .
why not ?
one , it &apos;s against regulations ,
and i &apos;d like to hold on to this job for a little while longer .
it &apos;s a minor administrative violation .
and two , i prefer to spend my money
on actual things ,
like single @-@ malt scotch , a fine cigar ,
beautiful artwork .
poker chips are things .
maybe just think of it as like a new experience .
i mean , at your age , how often does that happen ?
at my what ?
rossi , this may be our only chance
to get this guy .
all right. fine .
i &apos;m a decent poker player .
but i can &apos;t promise that i can
stay in the game lone enough to ...
you know what ?
i bet you &apos;re a great poker player ,
but what if we sent in reid ?
i am banned from casinos in las vegas , laughlin , and parump
because of my card @-@ counting ability .
look , i know i &apos;m not a genius like the boy wonder here ,
but poker is not blackjack. it &apos;s about bluffing ,
reading human nature , head games .
it &apos;s not math .
that &apos;s not entirely accurate .
there actually is a mathematical equation
for knowing when to raise and when to fold .
if p represents the size of the pot at the time of play ,
then p times n minus one ,
with n representing the estimated number of players
in the final round of betting--
ok , fine. i surrender .
just try not to lose all of my money .
i got it .
some of these guys have records ,
but the don &apos;t fit the profile .
keep looking he &apos;s gotta be there .
the last victim , eddie langdon , was wearing a watch
that was much too big for his wrist .
could it be stolen ?
or it was a gift from the unsub .
that fits , given the care and remorse for the victim .
ok , the link is set .
as soon as reid triggers the alarm , we can move in .
halitosis .
ok , got something for you .
all right , talk to me , mama .
eddie langdon. high school dropout ,
lots of odd jobs , never married ,
lived at transient @-@ type hotels in and around atlantic city .
started his own plumbing supply business that went bankrupt .
was in jail for 6 months in 2005 for forgery ,
and that &apos;s why we were able to get a match on his fingerprints so fast .
you &apos;ve always been fast , baby girl .
uh , yeah. gotta go .
... queen .
flush to the king .
i &apos;ll count it , sir .
all in .
you know , would it be all right
if i sat at table 2 instead of 4 ?
i have a pre @-@ glaucoma condition
and the light &apos;s kind of bothering my eyes .
thanks .
ah , i &apos;m calling .
i &apos;ll raise .
8,000 .
$ 8,000. that &apos;s , uh ,
56 months wages for the average person in bangladesh .
kind of makes you think , doesn &apos;t it ?
hey , it &apos;s 8 thou to you .
now , are you in or are you out ?
i ... am in .
and i raise .
3 raise .
that &apos;s too rich for my blood .
are you in , sir ?
i &apos;ll call .
call .
straight .
a gut shot straight draw ? are you kidding me ?
that is just-- that is nuts .
that &apos;s crazy , man .
do you mind if i take a look at this ?
hey. what &apos;s the problem , sir ?
hey , he &apos;s reaching for my chips .
i was simply admiring--
sir , you need to come with me .
you don &apos;t have to manhandle--i can walk .
i &apos;ll cooperate. don &apos;t manhandle me. thanks .
that &apos;s reid. let &apos;s go .
he &apos;s an fbi agent .
there he goes. plaid shirt , baseball hat .
morgan , he &apos;s a white male , baseball cap ,
he &apos;s headed towards the back door .
he &apos;s on the move .
we need to look at victimology again .
ok , uh , garcia said that eddie langdon
was a high @-@ school dropout , right ? chronic underachiever ?
what are you thinking ?
well , does that sound like someone
who has the financial know @-@ how and business sense
to start his own company from scratch all by himself ?
sir , you were right .
eddie langdon did have a partner
in that plumbing supply business .
curtis banks .
and banks pops up more than once in eddie &apos;s life .
they shared an apartment together .
when langdon was in jail for that forgery charge ,
it was banks who bailed him out. oh , there &apos;s more .
banks &apos; dad was a compulsive gambler , too .
won some sort of big jackpot in 1988 .
the father abandoned the family ,
ended up 6 months later dead in a las vegas hotel room ,
completely broke. drank himself to death .
do you have an address for banks ?
yeah . 800 brigantine road , galloway township .
that &apos;s 10 miles from atlantic city .
thanks. tell reid and morgan
to go to banks &apos; house. he may head back there .
yeah , hotch , there &apos;s nobody here .
there &apos;s a foreclosure sign on the front lawn .
all right , you and reid stay there in case he comes back .
yeah , dave .
i think i know the final piece of the unsub &apos;s system .
we know it involves violence .
we know it involves the number 8 .
but the killing of the person
at the gas station didn &apos;t work .
what about him was different from his partner ,
his loan shark , the call girl ?
he was a stranger. there was no personal connection .
exactly. that &apos;s why before the million @-@ dollar game
he killed his best friend .
so the closer the relationship , the better his luck .
and now he &apos;s gonna need the biggest
infusion of luck he &apos;s ever got
to escape this mess .
he &apos;s going after his wife .
curtis ?
what the hell ? what are you doing ?
curtis ! what are you doing here ?
curtis , you need to leave .
we &apos;re leaving together. we can do that now .
do what ?
tahiti .
look .
poker chips ?
uh , we &apos;ll get a boat , we &apos;ll sail to bora bora ,
and then we &apos;ll just-- we &apos;ll--
curtis , we &apos;re not going anywhere together .
don &apos;t you understand that ? look , you &apos;re sick .
we would get to tahiti
and you would find some other reason to play cards .
i &apos;m gonna ask you for the last time ...
leave .
liz , call the police .
no--oh--
nobody &apos;s calling anyone .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
sir , i found something .
teri banks filed for divorce two days ago .
she wasn &apos;t at home .
does she have any relatives or close friends nearby ?
yeah , she has a sister , liz dorsey ,
at 3388 woodland loop in northfield .
got it. thanks .
babe , maybe you &apos;re right .
maybe we can still do this .
tahiti , right ?
fresh start , you and me ?
you &apos;d make a lousy gambler , teri .
no poker face .
now you &apos;re just trying to stop what has to happen .
there &apos;s his car. he &apos;s in there .
let me go in and talk to him , aaron .
i know how these guys think .
all right .
jj , see if you can get an angle on banks .
hotch , he &apos;s got a gun .
he &apos;s holding two females hostage .
i don &apos;t have a clear shot here .
i &apos;m gonna go around the side .
i &apos;m unarmed .
i &apos;m unarmed. hey !
who the hell are you ? come here. come here , come here .
i &apos;m agent rossi with the fbi .
if you move , she is dead .
the house is surrounded .
now , you know there &apos;s only one way out of this , curtis .
you have to let the women go
and i &apos;ll take their place .
now , i &apos;ve seen a lot of killers in my life , curtis ,
but you &apos;re not like them .
you stumbled into this mess .
i can help get you out of it .
but you need to let them go .
get out of here. go. move !
sorry .
ok. that &apos;s good .
you &apos;ve made smart decisions , curtis , like i knew you would .
now , is this your wife ?
she stays .
you don &apos;t want to hurt her , son .
she &apos;s not the problem .
well , that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
she never believed in me and what i do .
and when i had good luck , she ruined it .
she &apos;s not the reason , curtis .
it was your father .
there &apos;s no such thing as manufacturing luck .
the same obsession is what killed him .
he passed it on to you ,
but you don &apos;t need to be like him .
i just need some time. i need some time , ok ?
just give me a minute to think .
that &apos;s fine .
hotch , he moved to the back room .
i still don &apos;t have a shot .
sit down .
i need just a minute .
keep your hands where i can see them .
rossi , he keeps glancing to his left. what &apos;s over there ?
i see it now .
see what ? what do you see , huh ?
i see why you feel time is running out .
sand is slipping through the hourglass .
58. that &apos;s why he &apos;s asking for more time .
8 : 00. let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ve always loved you , teri .
even though you fought me .
whatever &apos;s next ...
we &apos;re doing it together .
no , baby , pl @-@ please don &apos;t do this .
curtis , let her go .
no , no !
we love each other .
this is our dream .
together .
curtis , let her go .
all right , curtis , very slowly put the weapon on the ground .
i guess it is true what they say .
the house always wins .
no !
george augustus sala said ,
&quot; a gambler with a system
&quot; must be , to a greater or lesser extent , insane . &quot;
hi , miss thing .
enough is enough .
it &apos;s time for you and me to have a little sit @-@ down .
what &apos;s going on with you ?
half the time i call i get your voicemail .
when i do get you , i don &apos;t get even
a little bit of sass coming my way .
now , what &apos;s the deal ?
hello !
ok. look. i get it that men and women are different
and venus and mars and all that stuff ,
but i do not understand how you--whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .

baby , you had a little too much to drink the other night .
you called me to come over and keep you company .
i know. i remember that , but--
ok , what happened between us was popcorn .
and a movie on tv .
which you fell asleep in the middle of , by the way .
so you slept on the--
couch .

oh , thank you .
oh , thank you , god , for maintaining the integrity
of my most beloved of friendships ,
and from now on , i promise only mostly
the purest of mineral water will cross these lips .

hey , what &apos;s up , man ?

to have a standing date every tuesday night .
