patients who undergo an amputation
often feel sensation where the missing limb was ...
as if it &apos;s still there .
the syndrome is called &quot; phantom limb . &quot;
hey , what do we got ?
plane crash . open fracture of the left femur .
signs of massive infection .
it &apos;s as if the body can &apos;t accept
that a terrible trauma has occurred .
the mind is trying to make the body complete again .
patients who experience phantom limb ...
what ? what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
is it hurting again ?
no , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine . go back to sleep .
okay .
report many different sensations .
but by far , the most common ...
is pain .
uh , an acoustic neuroma ?
oh , boy .
a long , difficult surgery
with a stupid @-@ high post @-@ excision mortality / morbidity ?
that &apos;s what you want to start my hand with ?
it &apos;s my hand .
and thanks for making it sound so fun .
you can &apos;t try something with a little margin for error ?
i was so supposed to operate on jimmy months ago ,
but then the plane crashed . it has to be today .
well , if you can do this ,
i guess my hand can do anything .
still my hand .
okay , folks . let &apos;s just start .
as many of you know ,
seattle grace mercy west has suffered
a financial setback .
the administration is working hard
to keep the impact of that setback as small as possible .
to that end ,
we &apos;re gonna have to initiate some cost @-@ cutting measures .
the board has hired a physician advisor to help .
what &apos;s a physician advisor ?
well , she consults on maximizing efficiency ,
streamlining processes ,
assessing where we can trim our budgets .
who to fire and when to fire them ?
she &apos;s here to advise and to help .
i was hoping to introduce her in person ,
but she seems to be late .
oh , on her first day ?
not very efficient .
you can expect to see her in the halls ,
in your labs , in the o.r.
so we &apos;re gonna have an accountant
following us around the o.r.s ?
she &apos;s not an accountant . she is a trained surgeon .
frankly , she is here to try to help us .
thank you for your cooperation .
hey . can i get a minute ?
it &apos;s urgent .
yeah .
this was urgent ?
yes . it &apos;s the stupid pregnancy hormones .
it makes me want to have sex all the time , urgently .
oh , i like the stupid hormones .
oh , no .
what ?
oh , i have a consult .
what ?
i have a consult .
are you crying ?
no .
yes .
i cry every time i get mad .
you &apos;re not--you &apos;re mad ?
yes , i &apos;m mad , because i can &apos;t have sex
because i have this stupid consult .
dr. shepherd ?
ross ?
sorry to bother you , sir ,
but i was hoping to scrub in with you today ,
and i &apos;m supposed to be on dr. grey &apos;s service .
so i was wondering
if maybe you could talk to your wife for me .
i &apos;m gonna kill him .
no , ross , he cannot talk to his wife for you ,
because you are with me , and we have a consult
with a pregnant lady with abdominal pain .
so go do the workup ,
and i will see you there .
i am liking the stupid hormones .
here you go , doctor .
dr. kepner , um , we &apos;re swamped ,
and i have a shortness @-@ of @-@ breath lady
who needs a consult ,
and you probably have better things to do ,
but i need help , please . i &apos;m drowning here .
what bed ?
one , two , three--
what are you--stop it .
edwards , if you &apos;re covering the pit ,
it is your job to know every bed in the pit .
okay . put on your big @-@ girl pants .
you &apos;re about to learn how to run the pit . let &apos;s go .
i apologize for the wait , ma &apos;am .
you &apos;re experiencing shortness of breath ?
luckily , no . 45 minutes in an e.r. bed
before a doctor pulls out a stethoscope ?
i &apos;d likely be experiencing shortness of life .
i don &apos;t understand .
alana cahill . i &apos;m a physician advisor .
could you point me towards chief hunt ?
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve made me late for a meeting .
my bad .
it &apos;s like a knife is stabbing me .
you &apos;re sure it isn &apos;t early labor ?
because if it is , i &apos;m gonna need to call my sister
and have her bring me my makeup bag .
i &apos;m determined to look cuter than the baby in the pictures .
heidi .
sorry , honey . i babble when i &apos;m nervous .
brie hates it . she &apos;s the quiet one .
usually .
okay , well , it &apos;s definitely not labor ,
because i &apos;m not seeing any contractions .
and the baby &apos;s heart rate is good .
did you hear that , honey ? the baby &apos;s fine .
then what is going on ?
there &apos;s a few possibilities .
the labs should help clarify .
ross , did you get that chem @-@ 18 i ordered ?
um , i thought i checked off that box ,
but apparently i checked chem @-@ 7 .
my mistake , which i &apos;ll quickly fix .
in the meantime , i &apos;ll leave you the lab work i didn &apos;t forget .
i guess he babbles when he &apos;s nervous , too .
ah !
okay , okay .
everyone at namboze was so worried when we heard
the program might move to u.c.l.a. ,
myself included .
you make the kids feel so at home here .
well , we were never gonna let that happen .
no , i was away , but now i &apos;m back .
and as long as dr. karev and i are here ,
then the program stays here .
okay , um , nyah &apos;s pericarditis is quite severe .
the pericardial sac around her heart is inflamed
and starting to adhere to the heart itself .
so i &apos;ll perform what &apos;s called pericardial stripping .
so i &apos;ll remove the sac ,
and her heart will start beating on its own again .
what shall i tell her ?
oh , tell her we &apos;re gonna fix her heart ,
and she &apos;ll breathe much better .
nice program .
shame to see it go .
thanks . wait . what ?
we &apos;re getting a visit from the efficiency fairy .
you think she &apos;s not gonna make this disappear ?
look , shut up . we just got it back .
she &apos;s trimming fat .
you &apos;re flying kids across the world
for a pro bono surgery .
that &apos;s pretty fatty .
yeah , they &apos;re orphans .
well , now you &apos;re just making my point .
oh , my god .
mac 3 and cricoid pressure .
is she okay ? e.t. tube .
yeah , start her on 10 mics of dopamine ,
and where are the damn labs ?
here . she &apos;s in liver failure .
talk to me , bailey . what &apos;s going on ?
yeah , uh , ross is right .
brie &apos;s liver won &apos;t last another week .
i just went to the gift shop .
what happened ?
第九季 第十二集
is this because of the baby ?
no , no , no . it appears to be unrelated to the pregnancy .
brie &apos;s liver stopped filtering out toxins ,
so her body &apos;s shutting down .
without a transplant , her liver may not last 72 hours .
don &apos;t people wait years for a liver ?
not always . in emergency cases like this ,
patients get moved to the top of the list .
so we &apos;ve notified u.n.o.s. ,
and as soon as they have a liver ...
what--what--what about the baby ?
the baby is perfectly fine for now .
so now we just wait , okay ?
okay .
do not ...
say anything .
i am so ... so sorry .
is this you not saying anything ?
go away .
and do not come back
without a liver .
um , can i get you a tissue ?
go !
hey , there &apos;s my guy .
jimmy . hey , carla . how are you ?
please say you &apos;re not still married .
ah , afraid so .
ignore my sister . no boundaries . ah .
you think she cares ? unless she &apos;s the wife .
you the wife ?
oh , no . you &apos;re in the clear .
headaches still bad ?
he can barely get off the couch , he &apos;s so dizzy .
meanwhile , i have to wait on him like he &apos;s the boy prince .
warms your heart , doesn &apos;t she ?
yeah .
wilson , what are some of the other symptoms of an acoustic neuroma ?
hearing loss , increased intracranial pressure ,
tingling in the face--
and being a giant pain in my ass .
i tried to find another surgeon while your hand healed .
turns out , no one will go anywhere near this thing .
well , we &apos;re gonna run some scans and some labs
and see if the tumor has progressed .
you mean , it could be worse ?
well , we &apos;ll have a clearer idea once we see the scans .
see if you can switch with ross .
oh . did i--
no , it &apos;s nothing you did wrong .
it &apos;s that ross knows what i want before i even ask for it .
i won &apos;t have time to teach you on this one .
shepherd , this is alana cahill .
she is our physician advisor .
derek shepherd .
neuro . i saw you &apos;re doing an acoustic neuroma .
very exciting .
first thing tomorrow .
patient &apos;s here today .
are pre @-@ op overnight stays typical in all departments ?
that is a question for chief hunt .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have to prep .
hmm . well , i &apos;ll see you in the o.r. tomorrow .
typically , you need to be invited .
if things were running typically ,
i wouldn &apos;t be here , now would i ?
okay .
brian turner , age 55 .
minor head injury . vital signs stable .
fell off the damn ladder cleaning the damn gutter .
i was gonna say all that . fewer damns .
you &apos;ll need to know if he lost consciousness in the field .
sir , did you lose consciousness in the field ?
i didn &apos;t fall in a damn field . i fell in my damn yard .
ask the paramedic , not the patient .
oh , he was conscious the whole damn time .
um , could we just start over ?
uh , no time . get him triaged . go .
45 minutes in an e.r. bed before i saw a doctor .
well , that &apos;s not good .
no , it &apos;s not .
alana cahill ?
uh , dr. webber .
wow . uh , alana was a student of mine ,
uh , how many years ago now ?
oh , do we really have to say ?
she was a great student
and a gifted surgeon .
so what brings you back ?
you looking at joining the staff ?
uh , she is the physician advisor that i told you about .
um , well , we should get a cup of coffee , catch up .
i &apos;d love to , but i &apos;m pretty booked .
in fact , we should get going .
o @-@ of course . it was , uh , great to see you .
your hero sent me to trade services with you .
you &apos;re welcome .
can &apos;t .
i &apos;m waiting for u.n.o.s. to call with a liver .
so go wait in the o.r.
while you play teacher &apos;s pet with shepherd .
i &apos;m not moving from this spot .
great cell reception . see ? five bars .
you know it &apos;s not like ordering a pizza , right ?
it could take days .
my patient doesn &apos;t have days .
okay , fine . i &apos;ll wait .
and when u.n.o.s. calls , i &apos;ll run to medusa . i promise .
give me my phone .
if i miss the call , grey is gonna kill me .
if i go back to shepherd and i &apos;m not you ,
he &apos;s gonna kill me .
give me my phone .
oh , my god .
give me my phone .
hello ?
the pericardium is free .
you should see an increase in , uh , cardiac function .
it &apos;s weird . heart &apos;s floppy .
still not the way a kid &apos;s heart should look .
mm . could be endocarditis .
i &apos;ll do a biopsy .
uh , biopsy needle , please .
unless it &apos;s ...
oh , my god . it couldn &apos;t , could it ?
could this be endomyocardial fibrosis ?
i @-@ i &apos;ve only read about it . it &apos;s rare , subtropical .
could this be that ?
maybe .
remember we had that kid with pentalogy of cantrell ?
this program ...
is a medical freak show goldmine .
they can &apos;t cut it .
nobody &apos;s cutting it . robbins , tell her to stop saying that .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
you all right ?
okay , um , take that to path . stat , please .
oh , you know what ? i &apos;ll take it .
alex , you take my place .
the nurse can take it .
no , i &apos;d rather take it myself .
are there pastries
and bagels in every one of your lounges ?
no . well , maybe . i don &apos;t know .
is that the kind of thing you &apos;re gonna be looking at ?
i will be looking at everything , doctor .
huh . um , dr. robbins .
this is alana cahill .
oh . uh , are you all right ?
mm @-@ hmm . i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m sorry .
i ...
could you just give us a minute ?
of course .
that was the efficiency lady , right ?
yeah , so i probably look as crazy as a bag of cats .
so it was nice working with you .
is it phantom limb pain ?
callie said it only happens at night .
until now .
i &apos;m going crazy . i--
you &apos;re not . you &apos;re not crazy .
phantom limb is a very real thing .
i just left a surgery because there was pain
in a part of me that no longer exists .
so i-- what are you doing ?
we &apos;re helping you visualize a leg that doesn &apos;t hurt .
here we go . now ...
just look at that .
i ... are you kidding me ?
we are rerouting your brain ,
reminding it of what happened .
there are many treatments for phantom limb .
there &apos;s heat , there &apos;s massage ,
there &apos;s virtual reality therapy .
i knew a guy in the army who had to stab his prosthetic
with a screwdriver as hard ...
oh , great .
as he could .
well , that &apos;s not crazy .
well , for him , it was the only thing that worked .
now ...
is your pain any better ?
y @-@ ye--it is , a @-@ a @-@ a little .
you see ? you just need to figure out what works for you .
callie knows all this . what does she say ?
i ha--i haven &apos;t told her .
she &apos;s an orthopedic surgeon .
and i have been her patient for so long .
and i just am starting to feel like a wife again ,
and she needs me to . i cannot have this .
i am finally getting my life back together ,
and--and i will not be screwed over
by something that &apos;s not even there !
all right .
we &apos;re gonna work together .
we &apos;re gonna work together , and i &apos;m gonna help you ,
and we are gonna figure this out .
okay ?
african babies are a godsend .
you don &apos;t have to tell me .
oh , not zola . not the cute ones .
the sick ones .
they &apos;re exotically diseased ,
beautiful little train wrecks .
i just found a case of e.m.f. ,
and i get to do an endocardial stripping
of the left vericle .
do you know how many other people have done that ?
no .
me neither . it &apos;s unheard of .
where are you going ?
i have to see a man about a liver .
dr. bailey .
can i please get another intern ?
what &apos;s wrong with ross ?
a lot .
the kid made a tiny mistake .
because he &apos;s an idiot .
if i have to work with him one more second ,
i &apos;m probably gonna kill him .
uh , you think i didn &apos;t want to kill you ?
you cut l @-@ vad wires ,
and yet there you stand .
so ... be merciful and suck it up .
cousin dora sent him a stupid giant cookie ,
but he can &apos;t eat before surgery .
so now i &apos;m starving and i gotta look
at this giant freakin &apos; cookie that i can &apos;t have !
i keep just telling her to eat the damn thing .
oh , so you can make fat jokes ?
then throw it away .
jimmy--
oh , no . what &apos;s that look ? what &apos;s wrong ?
the tumor &apos;s progressed .
but you could still operate , right ?
yes , we can ,
but all those risks we talked about before--
like me going deaf ...
or half my face being melted like it was blowtorched ,
or me not surviving at all ?
yeah , the chances of those things happening are much higher .
so ... you should take some time
and think about if you still want to do the surgery .
i &apos;ve taken time .
i waited for months for you to get better .
doc , i can &apos;t just sit here
and wait for this thing to kill me .
i ...
i &apos;m dying , she makes it about her .
hey .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t let him see me cry .
i &apos;ll never hear the end of it .
no , it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s a horrible thing to say , i know ,
but when i heard you were in a plane crash ,
part of me was relieved .
it &apos;s an awful thing that happened to you ,
and i &apos;m so sorry .
but it gave me more time with my brother .
these past months have been the best we &apos;ve had .
i &apos;m ready .
we both are .
here &apos;s the recheck on the calcium level you asked for .
ross is gone , sir . i &apos;m sorry .
he and dr. grey went to go get a liver .
i don &apos;t want anybody in the gallery .
i don &apos;t need an audience .
you up for this ?
i want you to know , the thing with the labs ,
it won &apos;t ever happen again .
okay . just let it go , okay ?
congrats on the baby .
thank you .
you must be , what , three months in ?
baby &apos;s the size of a lemon .
so ... second trimester , huh ?
the fetus is growing feet ...
discharging urine into the amniotic fluid .
and you must be feeling better ,
less nausea .
but the second trimester &apos;s also known to bring with it
swollen gums , heartburn , gas--
do you want me to start crying ? !
and on three . one , two , three .
last b.p. was 110 over 70,
but there was significant dashboard damage .
stop . dr. edwards , what injuries are
we most concerned with in this patient ?
we always start with the abcs .
if you &apos;d been listening to the paramedic ,
you &apos;d have your answer . can you start over ?
there was significant damage to the dashboard--
what &apos;s the basic law of motion , edwards ?
the basic--
energy cannot be created or destroyed ,
but can change in form or be absorbed .
uh , which means the impact to the dashboard
was absorbed by the patient .
so the injuries we &apos;re most concerned with are ?
are knee injury , possible pelvis , c @-@ spine .
correct .
matthew here stabilized the pelvis in the field .
uh , it really wasn &apos;t that big of a--
so now you can start your exam .
so i &apos;ll just ... see myself out then .
okay .
okay , ross . there &apos;s the knot .
it &apos;s a nice one .
uh , okay .
yes , thank you . scissors .
careful now .
we &apos;re just gonna cut the suture
as close to the knot as possible
without--
oh , no .
are you serious ? !
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
you cut the hepatic artery in the hilum .
you cut the hilum before i had a chance to say ,
&quot; don &apos;t cut the hilum ! &quot;
you see what he did ?
don &apos;t ever do that .
clamp .
i don &apos;t know .
um , dr. robbins .
hey .
everything , uh , work out all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m sorry that you had to see that .
it was a @-@ a personal--
you were having a moment . yeah .
we all have &apos; em .
just sucks when they happen at work , right ?
i was , uh , just telling dr. cahill
how well nyah &apos;s surgery went .
yeah .
and that you let me finish the surgery on my own .
yeah .
thanks again .
that &apos;s impressive for a fellow .
oh , well , he &apos;s-- he &apos;s more than qualified .
well , i will be observing nyah &apos;s second surgery tomorrow .
so will that be you or dr. karev ?
oh , no , me , of course .
yeah . uh , with our cardio fellow dr. yang .
all right . i will see you there .
okay .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m sorry about this morning .
are we all set for tomorrow ?
uh ... 8 : 30 , o.r. 2 .
great .
uh , look , if you want to sit it out ,
yang and i can handle it .
maybe , you know , you should just take it easy .
it &apos;s just that yang keeps squawking about
how they &apos;re gonna cut the program ,
and i just don &apos;t want anything to--
yeah . um , are you finished ?
i just want everything to go well .
then i &apos;ll see you tomorrow morning .
10 @-@ blade , please .
did ...
did you see that ?
god ! ah !
morning .
oh . you all right in there ?
um , yeah .
no , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine . i was just--
i &apos;m about to take a shower .
oh , want some company ?
um , yeah , of course i do .
it &apos;s just , i &apos;m , um , i &apos;m running late .
so how about tonight ?
yeah . how about a movie night ?
yeah . you read my mind .
okay . all right .
unfortunately there was a surgical complication
with the donor liver , and it is no longer viable .
oh , god .
okay . so what happens now ?
well , brie is back on the transplant list .
we &apos;ll continue supportive care
so her body &apos;s ready
if another liver becomes available ,
or if we have to deliver the baby .
a c @-@ section ?
can--can she handle that ?
any surgery is risky ,
and her condition is causing her blood to stop clotting .
so we need to continue with the blood transfusions
and buy her some time until a liver becomes available .
if a new liver becomes available .
yes .
oh , god .
the last thing i said to her is , &quot; you &apos;re gonna be fine . &quot;
you have to fix her , please .
yeah . here .
you can see that she &apos;s still on the respirator .
her vitals actually ...
i hope you won &apos;t mention
my colossal incompetence to your husband .
he ... still thinks i &apos;m the golden boy .
no , stop that . you don &apos;t get to do that .
you don &apos;t get to feel sorry for yourself
or make little self @-@ deprecating remarks .
you destroyed a perfectly good liver today .
when i look at you , that is all i see .
a perfectly ...
good liver .
hold on a sec .
i &apos;m not done . put your phone away .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be sorry . be better .
i think it &apos;s u.n.o.s.
hello .
hmm . can i help you find something ?
no . i &apos;m just observing surgeries today ,
and i &apos;m trying to maximize my time .
shepherd &apos;s acoustic neuroma is at 8 : 00,
and that &apos;s gonna be a long one .
just trying to be everywhere at once .
actually , shepherd &apos;s surgery got pushed till later .
oh , i totally misread that .
that is going to work so much better for me .
thank you , doctor .
well , maybe that , uh , gives us time for coffee .
i &apos;m afraid not .
just time for me to see more surgeries .
well , i always did expect to see you in the o.r.
one way or another , right ?
right .
okay , now breathe .
try to calm the waves .
try to slow them down .
what-- what &apos;s the point here ?
well , the idea is ,
if you can teach your mind to calm the waves ,
you can teach it to ... calm the pain .
but i ...
i @-@ i can &apos;t do it . i can &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s--this is dumb .
this is not dumb . it is biofeedback .
look , i can &apos;t--i can &apos;t stop the stupid make @-@ believe waves .
so ... what else you got ?
well , i have a minimally invasive spinal surgery
that can deaden your nerves .
no , no , i have to operate today .
then i got make @-@ believe waves ,
or i got a make @-@ believe waterfall ,
or a make @-@ believe campfire .
or i could just find a screwdriver
and stab it in your foot .
just stab me in the head .
c.t. results on pelvic fracture .
thoracentesis if positive effusion .
um , musculoaponeurotic grafts ?
what are you doing ?
what am i-- what are you doing ?
i thought you were trying to talk dirty .
i didn &apos;t want you to feel like the only giant nerd .
i was talking out loud ?
yeah .
though i was weirdly kind of into it .
um , i have 60 million things to do today ,
and i &apos;m sure i &apos;m gonna forget something .
kepner &apos;s running me ragged .
and that &apos;s not working for me anymore .
you know , if you &apos;re too busy for this ,
we can , um ...
i am not too busy for this .
i am too busy for this .
all right .
thank you for understanding .
her last a.s.t. was 23 @-@ 42 .
i.n.r. was 6 .
is it viable ?
i think it &apos;s a match .
she &apos;d be crying if it wasn &apos;t .
she cries when she &apos;s angry , which is whenever she sees me .
look .
she &apos;s looking at me and not crying .
it &apos;s gotta be a match .
thank you so much . thank you .
we have a match .
you &apos;re gonna fly to portland , oregon .
i will fly to portland , oregon ,
to retrieve a liver for a woman
who i &apos;ve already destroyed one liver ?
is that the wisest use of our resources ?
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t get on a plane . you know that .
i know you haven &apos;t been on a plane .
maybe it &apos;s time you try again .
their procurement team is going to do all of the work .
you know good and well .
we prefer to do the recovery ourselves .
all he has to do is carry a cooler .
meredith .
if he &apos;s been to a picnic , he can handle this .
shane , have you ever been to a picnic ?
i &apos;ve been to a picnic .
oh , look at that . he &apos;s been to a picnic .
these women deserve more experience
than a fool who &apos;s eaten a potato salad in a park .
she &apos;s right . maybe i &apos;m not the best person--
you &apos;re an intern .
of course you &apos;re gonna make mistakes .
bad things happen , but you have to move past it .
leave it behind you , the sooner the better ,
or it will stop you from moving forward .
so just get over yourself .
move past it , and get your butt on that plane .
so ... now i &apos;m confused .
who &apos;s going portland ?
i can &apos;t .
you and i are going to portland .
mm . okay .
so , wilson , what do you see ?
cerebellum and occipital brain tissue .
mm @-@ hmm . healthy , perfect tissue--
tissue that needs to be wet .
so every ten minutes when you hear that timer ding ,
you need to drench the tissue .
okay .
okay , good . now when i get close to the tumor ,
what i &apos;m gonna do is , i &apos;m gonna ask you to--
drench the tissue . got it .
no . i &apos;m going to stimulate the facial nerve with a probe .
and then i &apos;m gonna ask you
to tell me when jimmy &apos;s face twitches .
as long as we see a twitch ,
his facial function is still intact .
okay . drench the tissue .
well , let &apos;s go . what are we waiting for ?
i got word to hold a minute .
okay , you &apos;re right . i can do this .
get off .
all right . well , call me when you get eyes on the liver .
yeah .
it looks good so far , bailey .
now remember , once we get it out ,
we &apos;re only 50 minutes out .
so you can start prepping her .
dr. ross .
i @-@ i , no .
i can &apos;t make the cut this time .
let &apos;s stop while we &apos;re ahead .
no , i don &apos;t want you to make the cut .
i want you to get the basin ,
so i can put the liver in the basin .
can you do that ?
yes . that i can do .
uh , dr. grey ...
is ... that a mass ?
no .
it isn &apos;t ?
no , i mean , it is .
i-- we have to have that biopsied .
and how much does the africa program cost ?
less than you &apos;d think .
admin costs comes out of an endowment ,
and all the surgical time is donated .
but endowments don &apos;t tend to grow
with the popularity of these programs ,
where , very soon , you have every sick kid in africa
banging down your door .
what happened ?
you need me to step in ?
no . no .
robbins ?
try to picture the waves .
i &apos;m trying .
okay , really , what is-- what is happening ?
just calm the waves .
these are tsunami @-@ force waves , owen .
what is wrong with this woman ?
i mean , is she having a panic attack ?
should she even be in the o.r. ?
don &apos;t you have another operation
you need to go see ?
i mean , shepherd &apos;s doing--
yeah , an acoustic neuroma , but that &apos;s later .
no , it &apos;s now . he started hours ago .
look , you should go . i &apos;ll take over .
all right . no one is moving .
i &apos;m stripping the endocardium from the papillary muscle .
i screw this up , i &apos;ll have to replace the mitral valve ,
so don &apos;t move .
i can switch out--
just shut up . i &apos;m at the beach .
something &apos;s wrong .
they should be back by now . something &apos;s wrong , isn &apos;t it ?
uh , um ...
there was a mass on the liver .
we &apos;re waiting for pathology to--
oh , god . a mass means cancer .
it &apos;s cancer . you got two donor livers in two days .
there &apos;s no chance we &apos;re getting another one .
if this one has cancer , then--
okay , okay , heidi , just-- it &apos;s not bad news yet .
okay ? so just come on .
take deep breaths .
okay ?
grey .
okay . yeah .
i &apos;ll see you in 50 minutes .
liver &apos;s fine .
oh , thank god .
okay . oh . thank you .
all right .
okay , now we have to remove the tumor
from the nerve sheath .
stimulator .
uh , i don &apos;t see any nerve fibers .
it encased the entire nerve ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid so . okay , facial function .
still twitching .
syringe .
i was worried i missed the whole thing .
where are we at ?
where we &apos;re at is , i &apos;m trying to focus .
i mean , how long has the patient been open ?
counting the minutes i &apos;m wasting
answering your questions ?
i &apos;d have fewer questions , but your intern told me
that the surgery had been moved to 3 : 00 .
clearly , it wasn &apos;t .
so forgive me if i &apos;m trying to play catch up .
intern mistake . i apologize .
dr. wilson was under orders not to allow any visitors--
i &apos;m not a visitor , dr. shepherd .
anyone who is not surgically necessary
is not welcome in my o.r.
all right , cottonoid ,
boki , please .
i have to switch , alex .
no one is switching .
you &apos;re holding the mitral valve , so don &apos;t move .
what &apos;s wrong ? are you sick ?
alex , take that scalpel ...
what ? what are you doing ?
and stab me in the foot .
what ?
what ?
my prosthetic . stab me .
what is wrong with you ?
dr. karev ,
i am the chief of surgery .
this is an order .
stab dr. robbins in the foot right now .
what ?
alex .
of course .
arizona ? alex !
that &apos;s better .
that &apos;s better .
suction .
what happened ? did i--
you didn &apos;t do anything . it &apos;s a bleeder . cautery .
cottonoid .
okay .
got it . how &apos;s the facial function ?
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t see a twitch .
come on , jimmy . twitch .
damn it .
what does that mean ?
it means we may have cost jimmy
the ability to move half his face .
we won &apos;t know until he wakes up .
oh , perfect timing , grey .
oh , no . did i step on your foot ?
no . i &apos;m not mad this time .
oh . so you cry when you &apos;re happy , too ?
apparently .
eyes on the liver . learn something .
edwards , status report .
your m.v.c. is in bed 1
waiting on an angio .
i paged an ortho consult for bed 2,
and drunk guy in bed 3 .
髌骨脱位and what &apos;s in bed 4 ?
new patient . patellar dislocation .
and bed 13 ?
there is no bed 13 .
good job , edwards . you passed .
and your waiting room is clear . nicely done .
ah , sorry to interrupt .
do you need something ?
kinda .
i &apos;ve been watching you for two days .
you don &apos;t seem to slow down .
i thought you might need a break .
maybe grab a cup of coffee ?
probably shouldn &apos;t have started
with the whole &quot; watching you &quot; thing , huh ?
now you think i &apos;m some sort of creeper . i &apos;m not .
unless you &apos;re inclined to have coffee with creepers ,
in which case , i totally creep ,
like , all the time .
her heart is , uh , pumping like a champ .
thank you , both of you .
what else do you have over there ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
uh ... sick ...
orphan ... children ?
kids with heart problems ?
she means , she &apos;s glad the program
is up and running again .
both of us are .
yes .
look at me . i &apos;m a mess .
i ate a stupid big cookie .
that &apos;s what you get when you keep me
worried sick for 22 hours .
hey , jimmy , can you wince like that again ?
answer the man .
facial expression looks symmetrical .
did he ... can you hear me ?
who could ignore that voice ?
all right , welcome . welcome , everyone .
thank you so much for coming .
it has been a privilege to watch you work ,
and i am so impressed with what i &apos;ve seen .
dr. karev &apos;s pediatric african exchange program--
you cannot cut that program .
i &apos;m sorry , but these children ,
these ... little orphans--
we are the only hope they have .
many of them have rare disorders
that most western doctors
rarely have the opportunity to treat .
and if you stop the program ,
i will never get that chance again .
they .
they will never get that chance ,
the precious children .
i have no intention of cutting it .
super .
it &apos;s a no @-@ brainer from a p.r. standpoint .
that kind of positive visibility is gold .
however , there will have to be some cuts .
and i &apos;m going to suggest one
that is going to seem surprising at first ,
but that addresses fiduciary concerns
with nominal impact on the core facility
and the human and physical resources .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . what ?
uh , yeah . i &apos;m out .
i am proposing that we close your e.r.
what ?
we &apos;re a level 1 trauma center .
we &apos;re a hospital .
in the last three days ,
your e.r. went from being in shambles to peak efficiency .
well , then why would you propose cutting it ?
this allowed me to see that in either case ,
it &apos;s not bringing in the money .
it &apos;s bringing in the patients .
over half of whom are non @-@ emergent , under @-@ insured ,
and belong in a primary care physician &apos;s office .
you have surgical interns in there doing chest exams .
it &apos;s hemorrhaging resources .
look , i know these cuts are going to be painful ,
but understand that i am trying to keep your hospital doors open .
this is ridiculous . you can &apos;t close the e.r.
you went to med school . you have to ask yourself--
do you have a better idea ?
because the way i see it ,
this woman is trying to keep the hospital from closing ,
in--in which case there &apos;d be no patients ,
we &apos;d have no jobs ,
and some of us don &apos;t have a few million to fall back on .
so unless you have a better idea ,
why don &apos;t you just sit there
and listen to what she has to say ?
all right .
so ... the other proposals
include a review of i.c.u. ,
step @-@ down closures with a reorganization of post @-@ op care ...
alana .
uh , you &apos;ve been here three days .
i &apos;ve been here for years .
maybe you judged us a little harshly ,
maybe we can work together--
being a harsh judge
is a necessary part of my job , sir .
i can see you &apos;re disappointed in me ,
but it was your job to judge me when you were my teacher .
you &apos;re not anymore .
no , that &apos;s not the case . i &apos;m--
you said something to us during my intern year
that i have never forgotten .
you said , &quot; medicine is constantly changing .
you need to be part of that change or get out . &quot;
i &apos;ll be making some changes .
you should be proud of me .
by the way , you logged fewer o.r. hours
than any other general surgeon on staff last month .
good night .
the body can be stubborn when it comes to accepting change .
ugh . this ...
this is so stupid .
we &apos;re a level 1 trauma center .
this woman &apos;s an idiot .
well , and a little bitchy .
ugh . this was supposed to be a good day .
shepherd did a 23 @-@ hour surgery .
we &apos;re supposed to be popping champagne .
let &apos;s try and go to sleep .
ugh ! i don &apos;t think i can . i &apos;m so pissed .
the mind holds out hope that the body can be whole again .
do you want to go to the beach with me ?
what ?
and the mind will always fight for hope , tooth and nail ...
bailey had no business calling you out like that .
she &apos;s nervous .
everybody &apos;s nervous .
everybody should be nervous .
it &apos;s not our fault .
is it ?
it feels like it is .
hey , congratulations .
for what ?
your acoustic neuroma .
you got your hand back . you &apos;re you again .
we can be happy about that .
until it finds a way of understanding this new reality ...
i flew on a plane today .
you did ?
i did .
congratulations .
and accepts that what is gone ...
is gone forever .
this really kind of works .
