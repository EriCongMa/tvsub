my sister &apos;s a ghost , and i never got to say goodbye to her .
matt ! please !
matt .
vicki ?
they &apos;re looking for michael .
the vampire who hunts vampires .
you don &apos;t want to wake him .
he will kill all of you .
elena &apos;s blood . drink it .
come on .
that &apos;s a good sign .
he &apos;s flipped the switch . stefan is gone .
and he &apos;s not coming back .
you can fight it . you just have to want it bad enough .
why , because i love you .
that &apos;s right , stefan . because you love me .
the only thing stronger than your craving for blood
is your love for this one girl .
turn it off .
no !
turn it off !
what did you do ?
i fixed him .
good morning .
so the pressure of your punch ejects the stakes .
easy enough .
that &apos;s weird .
must be jammed or something .
you &apos;re not strong enough .
better start lifting some weights ,
put some meat on your bones .
thanks for not sugar @-@ coating it .
you know what this is ?
a vervain grenade . i &apos;ve used one before .
then you know the element of surprise
is your only advantage when it comes to a vampire .
surprise .
oh my god !
this isn &apos;t a joke to me , ric .
you think i &apos;m joking ?
vampires will take whatever they want .
they will hurt whoever they want ,
and they &apos;ll do it without remorse .
it &apos;s their nature .
you don &apos;t have to use pronouns . you can say stefan .
look , i get why you &apos;re here .
stefan hurt you . you don &apos;t want it to happen again .
but you think that i &apos;m crazy
to believe that i can protect myself
from a vampire who &apos;s flipped the switch on his humanity .
i think you found a way to get out of bed this morning ,
and that makes you the strongest person i know .
i think that you can do pretty much anything .
here we are . senior year .
anyone else think it should feel slightly more empowering ?
ok . so prank night was a bust .
but we are accepting it , and we are moving on .
you &apos;re right . i mean , why should i let the fact
that my boyfriend is seeing the ghost of
his dead girlfriend hinder this experience ?
yes ! and why should i let the fact
that my boyfriend was turned into a hybrid
put a damper on an otherwise fabulous day .
today &apos;s our anniversary .
technically , stefan and
i met on the first day of school last year .
yeah . you win .
are you sure you want to be here ?
i have to be here . i have to put it behind me .
new year . new life .
uh @-@ oh . alexandra ,
left hand , please .
hey , the 2 brunettes on the staircase owe me a persian rug .
you mean , they owe us a persian rug ?
it &apos;s my house , too , brother . ooh ! would you like a spin ?
so this is what klaus had in mind
when he compelled you to protect elena ?
these ladies are helping me be all that i can be .
where &apos;s stefan ?
who the hell are you ?
he left me here . my brother actually left me here .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
your tone implies that i &apos;m actually supposed to care .
you &apos;re klaus &apos;s sister ?
rebekah . pleasure , i &apos;m sure .
which one &apos;s my room ?
you &apos;re not staying here .
rude . both of you .
i &apos;ll see to it myself .
so i guess she &apos;s staying here .
so what ? it &apos;s not cool to talk to juniors anymore ?
hey . happy first day .
you mad ?
i &apos;m not mad . i &apos;m resigned to the fact
i &apos;m sharing space in our relationship with anna and vicki .
i haven &apos;t talked to vicki in a while .
that &apos;s not the point , jeremy .
i know that . i know . ok ?
but i had to see anna again , bonnie .
she had information that damon needed .
i get it , jeremy . but put yourself in my shoes .
you loved both of them ,
and you guys didn &apos;t break up .
they died , and you keep letting them back in .
you think i want any of this ?
i , um ...
i think you have the power to decide
whether or not you see them .
remember that . ok ?
you were always so much
better at being a part of this than i was .
sorry .
you can &apos;t just keep appearing like this . freaks me out .
i &apos;m a ghost . it &apos;s all i got .
and i couldn &apos;t appear if you weren &apos;t thinking about me .
well , i was just thinking about our first day last year .
i was worried about running into elena and you said--
suck it up . be a man .
and show her what she &apos;s missing .
yeah . instead , she met a vampire .
you ok , matty ? you seem unhappy .
yeah , i just ... life stuff .
you know , with you gone and mom not around ,
it &apos;s ... a lot to deal with alone .
i &apos;m glad i get to talk to you , though .
i miss you .
i miss you , too .
what if i told you there was a way
that you could help me come back ?
what do you mean come back ?
donovan ! what are you doing ?
come on , man . let &apos;s go !
you talking to yourself ?
what &apos;s got you in such a good mood ?
we &apos;re seniors , man . life is good .
come on , michael , breakfast .
yummy . michael , wake up !
what ?
what ? what do you mean , &quot; what &quot; ? i &apos;ve been calling you for 2 days .
odd , that &apos;s exactly how long i &apos;ve been ignoring you .
jeremy gilbert told me that you found michael .
sort of . he &apos;s a little bit out of commission .
he won &apos;t eat . and i &apos;ve tried everything--
gravediggers , mourners , mice , rats , bats .
he &apos;s just not interested .
well , try harder .
we need him to kill klaus so i can de @-@ rippefy stefan
before he destroys my house .
fine .
i &apos;ll give it another shot .
hey . are you checking up on me ? because i &apos;m fine .
yeah . so ...
you might not want to come here for a while .
we have a new housemate .
barbie klaus .
rebekah ?
she &apos;s living with you now ? why ?
she &apos;s stranded .
apparently klaus left her in the dust
after i namedropped michael .
what about stefan ? what is he up to ?
oh , you know . journaling , reading , shaping his hair .
come on , damon . i can handle it . what ?
is that the bell ? oh--
ring ! ring ! don &apos;t want to be late .
i forgot about the bonfire .
you have to go . it &apos;s our first spirit squad event .
and it sets the bar for the whole year .
relax , caroline . i &apos;ll be there .
thank you . it &apos;s just that--
happy first day .
is that blood ?
oh my god
what &apos;s going on ? !
vampire 101--don &apos;t wear your breakfast to school !
chill out . it was just a blood bag .
from where ?
rebekah hooked me up .
rebekah ? and what are you even talking to her for ?
klaus told her to keep a watch on me .
protect his new asset .
his what ? why are you amused by this ?
i &apos;m his first successful hybrid , caroline .
don &apos;t you think that &apos;s the tiniest bit awesome ?
i cannot believe you just said that .
so , i &apos;m going to go .
good luck .
hello , elena .
what are you doing here ?
what do you mean ? i &apos;m going back to school .
go timberwolves !
what ? ! why ?
klaus wants me to keep an eye on you .
i &apos;m just doing what i &apos;m told .
i &apos;m going to be late for class .
oh , class is this way .
let go of me , stefan .
elena , do you think
i want to be a senior for the 100th time ?
no . i don &apos;t have a choice in the matter .
and neither do you .
i said let go of me .
let her go .
stefan ! stop it .
you &apos;re not going to get in my way . you hear me ?
i will see you both in history .
what the hell is he doing here ? !
klaus compelled him to watch over me .
apparently , i &apos;m one of klaus &apos;s assets
now that my blood is the only way he can create a hybrid .
so now he &apos;s a bodyguard ?
i don &apos;t know what he is . but he &apos;s definitely not stefan .
look , his being here is not good for any of us .
we have to do something .
you &apos;re in my seat .
hey , you .
welcome back , seniors .
let &apos;s turn our brains back on ,
starting with this country &apos;s original founders--
native americans .
what about the vikings ?
there &apos;s no evidence that
viking explorers actually settled in the united states .
who are you ?
my name &apos;s rebekah . i &apos;m new .
and history &apos;s my favorite subject .
you &apos;ve got no business in the stoner pit .
figured you &apos;d feel comfortable here .
touche .
so what do you mean that i can help you come back ?
right now , i can only come back when you &apos;re thinking of me .
but there is a way that i can be free of that .
how ?
i know this sounds crazy .
but i have help from the other side .
the other side ?
dude , what are you doing over here ?
i could ask you the same question .
just looking for my stoner lab partner .
all right , see you around .
can he not see you anymore ?
he was talking to vicki right out there in the open .
how ?
when he died and came back ,
he must have started seeing her .
she said that she could come back ,
that she had help on the other side .
help ? what kind of help ?
who &apos;s helping you ?
the witch i &apos;ve been talking to says that there &apos;s a ritual .
she can do magic from my side to push me over to yours .
is it even possible ? could she come back ?
i guess if she had a stronger foothold .
like an anchor ?
exactly .
right now , i &apos;m tethered to you .
my only access point to your side is through you .
but if she were to get a stronger foothold ...
i &apos;ll be able to come and go as i please
when i want , where i want .
i won &apos;t have to rely on you .
but you &apos;ll still be a ghost , vicki .
in a town full of vampires , werewolves , and witches ,
i &apos;ll fit right in .
seriously . you &apos;re going to make jokes about this ?
matt ! relax .
no one else will be able to see me .
she &apos;s bad news , jeremy .
there &apos;s nothing but darkness round her .
this is vicki we &apos;re talking about .
all right ? she &apos;s not a bad person .
you can &apos;t upset the balance of nature without a price .
if she &apos;s using a witch &apos;s energy from the other side ,
you don &apos;t know what price she &apos;s going to pay .
i can be a part of this life again , matt .
instead of being on the other side all alone .
you won &apos;t have to be alone anymore either .
what do i have to do ?
has anybody seen dana ?
sounds like you have an opening on the squad .
what are you doing ?
you can &apos;t just come here
and infiltrate all our lives .
i &apos;m only interested in yours .
your spark , your popularity .
maybe even your boyfriend .
it &apos;s not the ballet , ladies . let &apos;s move ! let &apos;s move !
i think we &apos;re done here , coach .
did you have a mental breakdown , lockwood ? get back in line .
i have a better idea .
shut the hell up so we can go get drunk at the bonfire .
hit the showers , gentlemen .
try to be a little more subtle , tyler .
coming from the queen of subtlety ?
relax . i &apos;m in total control .
then why are you acting like this ?
drop it , caroline . i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;ve never been better .
klaus has given me this ... gift .
what ? !
hey , check out the new girl !
come on , rebekah . you &apos;ve got it !
my god !
damn , girl &apos;s got moves .
look at you being all fit .
hey , you going to the bonfire tonight ?
sounds like fun , right ?
seriously , stefan , leave me alone .
you think i &apos;m annoying now ?
wait till homecoming .
hey , who are you bringing , by the way ?
i don &apos;t want to be weird .
i am sorry .
watch it , dick !
who are you ? !
i &apos;m the guy who &apos;s been assigned
to protect a human blood bag .
i mean , no offense or anything .
what ? !
no !
get it away .
you need blood .
get it away from me .
happy ?
i remember you . chicago , 1920s .
you were looking for klaus .
you &apos;re not so scary for a badass vampire vampire hunter .
what ? are you going to bench press a vampire ?
do you actually know what &apos;s happening right now ?
stefan called me a human blood bag .
he &apos;s a completely different person .
what are you doing ?
helping you out .
damon !
come on , buffy !
stop it !
like one obnoxious salvatore isn &apos;t bad enough .
you called . i &apos;m here .
what &apos;s your plan , oh warrior princess ?
i want to lock stefan up ,
at least until this mikael guy comes , kills klaus ,
and the compulsion breaks .
compulsion or not , stefan &apos;s high on human blood .
ok ? a lot of it .
you &apos;ve gotten him off of it before .
this is different .
it &apos;s not a stint in rehab , elena .
his humanity &apos;s gone . light &apos;s out .
no one &apos;s home .
then do it for me , damon .
every single time i look at him ,
i feel like i &apos;m going to break .
and i &apos;m not going to give him that satisfaction .
what are you doing ?
feel that ?
it &apos;s a sternum .
solid plate of bone .
right here ,
just below the ribcage ,
next to the spine ,
that &apos;s your way to a vampire &apos;s heart .
i &apos;ll do whatever it is you need me to do , elena .
no one &apos;s going to hurt you .
especially not my brother .
i &apos;ll lure stefan away from the bonfire .
then when he &apos;s distracted--
i &apos;ll shoot him .
can &apos;t bonnie just ju @-@ ju him or something ?
i &apos;m trying to keep bonnie out of this .
i don &apos;t trust that stefan won &apos;t hurt her .
caroline , are you covered ?
yes !
i will make sure that the
old forbes jail cell is prepped and ready .
we &apos;re forgetting a key player here . rebekah ?
wherever stefan goes , the blond ponytail tends to follow .
which is why it &apos;s your job to keep her away .
how ? ! she &apos;s an original .
last time i checked , we &apos;re out of daggers .
so then preoccupy her with her charm .
might have better luck finding the dagger .
are you ever not going to be mad at me , rick ?
doubtful .
sorry i &apos;m late . what &apos;s going on ?
we need you to raid your mom &apos;s vervain supply .
enough to keep stefan down for a while .
you can &apos;t do that to stefan .
why not ?
trust me , tyler , it &apos;s in his best interest .
yeah .
it &apos;s not in klaus &apos;s .
but klaus is the bad guy , tyler .
you know , why are you
acting like some freaky , hybrid , slave minion .
what ?
klaus made me who i am , caroline .
i owe him everything .
oh , boy .
ok , can we cool it on the commentary , please .
what is going on ?
i &apos;m just going to go .
what are you doing ? !
he &apos;s been sired .
what ?
sired .
he feels loyal to klaus because klaus &apos;s blood created him .
loyal how ?
he &apos;ll seek acceptance from his master .
it &apos;s really rare . but maybe not so much in hybrids .
so how do i fix him ?
get a new boyfriend .
you all right there ?
i thought tyler would be here .
tyler , now , huh ? it &apos;s gonna fickle .
when you &apos;re willing to give me the time of day again ,
then we &apos;ll talk .
until then , a girl has needs .
excuse me .
elena , hi . what are you doing ?
i &apos;m having fun , stefan . you got a problem with that ?
all right , take it easy .
we both know you &apos;re kind of a lightweight .
uh @-@ huh . really ?
you think i &apos;m going to let a blood addict tell me how to drink ?
concentrate on me , matty .
this is too weird .
just focus . this is a good thing .
now say you accept me .
i accept you .
did you just--
i felt that .
i feel that , too .
it worked . oh !
i &apos;m here , matty !
did you talk to anna about this ?
she &apos;s on the other side , bonnie .
ok . i thought she might know something .
about what ? i thought they were all alone over there .
somehow vicki &apos;s been communicating with some super strong witch .
if there &apos;s another witch involved ,
don &apos;t you think you should
have come to me before you went to anna ?
tell her not to be upset . i was just trying to help .
not now , anna .
she &apos;s here ?
she &apos;s just trying to help .
i can &apos;t-- i can &apos;t deal with this--
bonnie !
matt &apos;s trying to resurrect his dead sister .
i think i &apos;ll go deal with that instead .
ah , i can feel this .
i can feel everything .
witch didn &apos;t mention this part ?
makes sense .
our deal was that she &apos;d help me do what i need to do .
what are you talking about ? what deal , vic ?
well , if i want to stay here ,
i have to help her restore the balance .
klaus &apos;s hybrids can &apos;t be allowed to survive .
you can &apos;t kill tyler , vicki .
not tyler , matt .
it &apos;s elena who &apos;s the key to creating the hybrids .
what ? vicki , no !
i &apos;m sorry , matty .
but i want to stay .
what ? no friends your own age ?
like you can talk .
is this supposed to be fun ? i &apos;ve been through 10 of these .
no , you &apos;re just looking at it all wrong .
look . it &apos;s a little rough on the out side ,
but the inside ...
yum .
it &apos;s good .
yep .
what &apos;s that look ?
what look ?
my brother &apos;s got his flirt on ,
and you &apos;re jealous .
i &apos;m not jealous .
it &apos;s all right . be jealous by all means .
i &apos;m sure damon will be thrilled .
i &apos;m not jealous , stefan .
all right . that &apos;s my mistake .
whatever . i &apos;m out of here .
matt ! matt , slow down . what happened ?
i messed up , bonnie .
what ? how ?
where is she ?
can &apos;t believe you &apos;ve never had one of these before .
well , i &apos;ve been in a casket for 90 years .
that &apos;s no excuse .
why are you being so nice to me ?
you hate me . you should be mean .
well , i could be mean if that &apos;s what you &apos;re into .
you &apos;re distracting me . why ?
just trying to be a good housemate .
there &apos;s no fair fight between us , damon .
remember that .
what the hell ?
how did i get home ?
i brought you here . you were being a d @-@ bag .
what is your problem today ?
my problem is you &apos;ve been sired .
do you even know what that means ?
it means that you put klaus &apos;s needs first .
he is your master now .
i &apos;m not anyone &apos;s pet , caroline .
he doesn &apos;t control me .
well , something &apos;s got to be controlling you .
because i don &apos;t know why else
you &apos;d be acting like the old you .
the old me ?
yeah . the old you . the pre @-@ werewolf you .
you know , the obnoxious you that i would never be friends with .
whoa ! wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t want to be that guy .
i hated that guy .
you &apos;re a vampire now , tyler .
everything about your personality is heightened .
so you have to be careful .
i will .
promise .
just ... don &apos;t hate me .
everything i like about me
is you .
i used to know every constellation .
how did i forget them all ?
you &apos;re drunk . you need to go home .
fine . unh . let me find my car .
you &apos;re joking , right ?
uh @-@ oh . it &apos;s the fun police .
i thought that ripper stefan
was supposed to be the life of the party .
well , all right , i &apos;m driving you home . come on .
what are you , 5 ? get down .
why ? are you afraid that i &apos;m going to--ohh .
ha . that was close .
klaus would not be happy with you .
you &apos;re hilarious .
look , stefan , no hands .
i knew you &apos;d catch me .
you ok ?
yeah . i &apos;m ...
fine .
you look , uh , not sober .
the plan worked . that &apos;s all that matters .
let &apos;s just get him out of here .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i didn &apos;t think she &apos;d do something like this .
i trusted her .
you need to tell me exactly
what you did to let vicki out .
so i know exactly how to send her back .
i see all the geniuses came out to the bonfire tonight .
elena ! elena !
open the door .
i can &apos;t ! it won &apos;t open .
what the hell ?
i &apos;m sorry , elena .
i found a spell
that can block whatever magic is helping vicki .
what do i do ?
give me your hand .
stefan .
stefan !
oh , my god .
no !
what is she doing ?
fixing my mistake .
make her stop .
bonnie--
the spell is working .
she &apos;s still here because of you .
matt , please .
i can &apos;t let you hurt anyone , vicki .
i won &apos;t . i &apos;ll stop .
just , please , don &apos;t make me go .
i have to .
this is wrong . you shouldn &apos;t be here .
i &apos;m sorry .
i just didn &apos;t want to be alone anymore .
neither did i.
but i have to let you go .
goodbye , vicki .
she &apos;s gone .
hurry up before it blows .
wait ! wait , wait , wait !
give it to me . i can do it .
no , let me .
damon , come on .
elena , you almost got barbecued .
the least i can do is apply first aid .
there .
you played your part of the plan really well tonight .
oh , yeah ?
you had rebekah drooling all over you
and your marshmallows .
yeah , before she skewered me .
i thought you were too drunk to notice .
i was faking most of it .
so was i.
ready to get going , elena ?
great work tonight , ric .
sorry about the car , man . bummer .
you &apos;re always running out on me .
you have to earn the overnighter .
i consider that a challenge .
bye .
what are you doing here ?
i have something for you .
what ?
a little present .
you should go .
you sure ?
i think my brother would want his hybrid
to indulge in everything life has to offer .
i apologize for my outburst .
it would have made more sense had you known that
i &apos;ve been denying myself
human blood for as long as i can remember .
why is it that you awoke me ?
i thought you might know how to kill klaus .
but something tells me that i &apos;ve been sorely misinformed .
would you mind helping me with these ?
i can assure you there &apos;s
no way i can kill klaus from beneath them .
does that you mean you do know how to kill him ?
i can kill klaus .
and i will .
thank you .
a little blood will grease those muscles up real quick .
just saying ...
i don &apos;t feed on living things .
then what do you eat ?
it &apos;s ok if you want to be friends with damon again .
i don &apos;t .
i think he kind of misses you .
well you got me tonight .
definitely wasn &apos;t expecting that .
that was the point .
yeah .
you know , you can hate it all you want , but elena needs me .
i &apos;ll always protect her .
i think you &apos;re both better off having me around .
elena , wait .
you could have let me die in that fire tonight .
why didn &apos;t you ?
because i still have hope .
after everything i &apos;ve done , you ...
you still think i &apos;ll be able to find my humanity again .
yes , i do .
i know who you really are
better than anyone , stefan .
and i &apos;m not giving up .
elena , do you have any idea
how pathetic that makes you ?
no , stefan , it makes me strong .
bonnie , come on . stop dodging my calls .
don &apos;t you think we should at least talk about this ?
i shouldn &apos;t be here .
no kidding .
no , i mean , i shouldn &apos;t be here , jeremy .
why are you thinking about me when you &apos;re calling her ?
i didn &apos;t think i was .
look , i don &apos;t know . ok .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing , anna .
the problem is i don &apos;t think i can stop thinking about you .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about you , either .
what are we going to do ?
do you ... feel this ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i can feel you .
how can i feel you ?
keep it up , stefan .
this is going to be fun .
