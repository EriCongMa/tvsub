move , move ! let &apos;s get to this .
hey , boys ! come in .
ok , let &apos;s go , go , go !

all clear . target acquired .
damn , guys ! that hurt .
for real .
well to go . boys !
yeah , dude !
yeah ! all right , man !
dude , awesome .
that was unreal !
let &apos;s go again .
very funny , scott . game &apos;s over . come on .
time to get up .
oh , my god .
aloha , honolulu .
looks like a bright and beautiful day
as we kick off another pro bowl weekend .
the nfl &apos;s biggest stars are in town ,
and if you want to see them live at hawaiian airlines field
at aloha stadium tomorrow ,
i &apos;ll be giving away tickets to the tenth caller .
aloha , fellas . can i interest you
in today &apos;s pro bowl lunch special ?
the only thing special about that
is that you jacked the prices up by 300 % .
you know how it is , mcgarrett . supply and demand .
big cuz here knows how to supersize da profits .
okay , thanks , flippa ,
but we &apos;re not here for lunch anyways .
no . where are my pro bowl tickets , babe ? come on .
one row up from the afc sideline .
just like you asked .
nice .
my man . what are we doing ?
we got three here .
no , we only want two .
just two , me and danny .
third one &apos;s for me .
consider it a convenience charge .
convenience ? convenience to who ?
me .
yeah , i got that .
you gonna fork up some cash or what ?
what are you talking about ?
it was your idea to get the big sideline seats .
now you want me to pay for &apos; em ?
yeah , what gives ?
why did you have to sit so close to the field ?
yeah .
it &apos;s none of your ...
tell him why .
okay , okay , because peyton manning is playing , okay ,
and i &apos;d like a chance to meet him .
i thought the jets was your team .
the jets are my team , okay ,
but this is the one game of the year
where i just get to be a fan , a fan of the sport .
no specific teams .
i &apos;m just a fan enjoying the game ,
and i am not gonna miss my opportunity
to meet the greatest quarterback of our generation .
okay , wait a minute . stop .
stop what ?
the greatest quarterback of our generation ?
that &apos;s what i said .
first of all , greatness is measured in championships .
am i wrong ?
and if we go by that measure , tom brady ,
tom brady is the greatest quarterback of our generation .
he has three rings to manning &apos;s one .
i knew you would say something stupid like that .
three to one .
listen , tom brady is fantastic .
he &apos;s great . he &apos;s got good hair , he &apos;s got a supermodel wife ,
he &apos;s got the chin , the cary grant chin , yeah .
but peyton is without question a better passer .
you &apos;re out of your mind .
gentlemen .
what ?
debating on which one of those guys are better is pointless .
it &apos;s like arguing about
who &apos;s the greatest rock and roll band of all time ,
the beatles or the stones ?
oh , it &apos;s easy . the beatles .
it &apos;s the stones .
of course the brady fan says the beatles . see this ?
look , i think the takeaway is
we &apos;re living in the new golden age of quarterbacks .
we got brady , manning , rodgers , brees .
it &apos;s almost an embarrassment of riches .
that &apos;s a deeply insightful analysis .
i just hate to see you two guys fight .
fighting ?
this isn &apos;t fighting .
mcgarrett .
so let me get this straight .
you &apos;re telling me people , they pay good money
to get chased around and shot at with a pellet gun ?
everything about these guns is real
except for the ammunition they fire .
trust me , those training rounds ,
they pack more of a punch than you &apos;d think .
i &apos;ll take your word for it .
you know what ?
we should come and do
one of these tactical simulations sometime .
it &apos;s fantastic for team building .
no , no , no . listen ,
working with you is harrowing enough , okay ?
i do not need you hunting me for sport .
oh , you &apos;re right . it wouldn &apos;t be much of a challenge .
vic &apos;s name is scott davis .
worked for ardus microsystems ,
a technology firm based out of california .
a bunch of executives flew in for a corporate retreat ,
and they booked out the entire facility for themselves .
looks like a nine @-@ mil through and through .
and the powder burns indicate it was fired from close range .
okay , these guys are running around
shooting each other with pellet guns ,
this guy gets hit with a real bullet .
how does that happen ?
that &apos;s a good question to which i don &apos;t have an answer .
and to make things a little more challenging for us ,
there are no surveillance cameras on the property .
that &apos;s great .
but the good news
is that all the players were wearing action cameras .
that is good news .
maybe one of them caught our killer in the act .
i &apos;ve broken down the rifles used in the simulation .
barrels measure out at seven millimeters .
even if you modify the firing mechanism ,
there &apos;s no way one these could have discharged a nine @-@ mil round .
okay , so that means somebody had to have a real gun .
wouldn &apos;t be hard to pull off .
participants don &apos;t get searched coming in ,
and the simulation guns look so authentic ,
it &apos;s hard to tell them apart from the real thing .
steve .
duke , what do you got ?
handgun , nine @-@ millimeter .
my guys found it ditched in some scrub
less than 50 yards from the murder scene .
pocket pistol . ideal for concealed carry .
right . so one of davis &apos;s coworkers
could have snuck this on , killed him ,
then dumped the weapon before you guys arrived .
so much for team building .
i take it gsr testing is out .
i mean , all of these guys are gonna have gunpowder
on them from the simulation weapons .
but only the murder weapon fired real bullets .
which is why we &apos;re testing for lead .
if it &apos;s present on one of these guys ,
they &apos;re our shooter .
guys , give me a second .
i shouldn &apos;t even be here .
this retreat is for executives only ,
and i &apos;m just an assistant .
but scott knew it was my dream to visit hawaii ,
so he paid for me to come .
the flight , the hotel , all out of his own pocket .
melinda , i have to ask you a question .
to the best of your knowledge ,
did any of scott &apos;s associates have a ,
have a problem with him ?
scott davis was the smartest person i &apos;ve ever met in my life .
people can be intimidated by that ,
but everyone at work loved him .
okay .
give me a second , please ?
sure .
thanks .
the results came in .
none of these guys tested positive for lead trace .
so who fired the murder weapon ?
okay , so the time codes are all synced up
and all 11 action cameras are playing back in real time .
try not to shoot me in the back , dude !
we &apos;re on the same team !
aw , crap .
uh , which way does this thing go in ?
come on , man , it &apos;s not that hard .
wait a minute . pause . pause it .
where &apos;s this guy &apos;s camera angle ?
uh , doesn &apos;t look like we have it .
but all 11 camera feeds are up and running .
well , punch in on him .
well , that &apos;s why we don &apos;t have it .
he &apos;s not wearing an action cam .
yeah . check out his mask .
it &apos;s a pretty different than the others .
okay , so we got 12 men on the field .
yeah , 11 players , one killer .
we have road blocks set up , birds in the air .
no sign of our suspect so far .
it &apos;s been over an hour .
even in this terrain , he &apos;s long gone .
what about the murder weapon ?
lab &apos;s processing it now . looks like a dead end .
no prints , serial number &apos;s been filed off .
all right , thanks , duke .
thanks .
hey , i showed around a photo of our shooter ,
but no one remembers seeing him during the training simulation .
turns out one of their colleagues
was supposed to join them this morning .
never showed up . his name &apos;s brent mercer .
yeah , i ran his credit card .
he just booked a flight out of town .
leaves honolulu in an hour .
an hour ? guys skips town that quickly
after his colleague &apos;s murder ,
it &apos;s the guy i want to talk to .
i don &apos;t know who you people are ,
but you &apos;re damn sure gonna explain to me
why you pulled me off my flight
and strapped me to this chair .
i should be halfway to san francisco by now .
if you &apos;re done , maybe we could focus on
where you were this morning , specifically at 9 : 27 a.m.
which is the exact time
that your coworker scott davis was shot and killed .
what ?
scott &apos;s dead ?
wow . the award for best performance
by a murder suspect goes to ...
wait , wait , wait . you guys think i killed him ?
that @-@ that &apos;s insane .
well , it &apos;s not really insane .
you were conspicuously absent
from the field trip this morning ,
and you still haven &apos;t told us where you were .
i was at the hotel .
i was sleeping in .
oh , yeah ?
can anyone corroborate that ?
no .
all right , let &apos;s @-@ let &apos;s recap .
you hated the victim ,
you have no alibi ,
and you tried to duck out of town
just a little while after he was killed .
whoa , who said ... who said i hated scott ?
you said you hated scott quite articulately , actually .
scott , it &apos;s brent .
you know , i always knew you were an arrogant son of a bitch ,
but you proved yourself tonight , pal .
those guys can keep kissing your ass .
i &apos;m done with you .
is that your voice ?
is that your voice ?
yeah , it &apos;s my voice .
okay , so you leave this message
on scott &apos;s voice mail late last night .
then less than 12 hours later , he &apos;s dead .
it &apos;s not what it sounds like .
look , guys , a bunch of us ,
we went out for drinks last night .
and we ran into scott , okay ?
i went over to him , and i said hi ,
and he completely blew me off .
i mean , this is coming from the kid
who used to grab me my coffee when i started at ardus ,
and now i have to report to him .
so forgive me , but when he treated me that way ,
it was humiliating .
all right , good . the only thing missing was motive ,
and you &apos;ve kindly provided that now .
guys , guys , i was drunk , i admit ,
and i was pissed .
it was wrong , but the minute i woke up this morning ,
i regretted leaving that message , okay ?
i did .
that &apos;s the whole reason i bailed on the outing .
i was embarrassed to face scott .
that &apos;s the truth , but i didn &apos;t kill him .
chin ?
the ceo of ardus is a guy named neil redding .
he &apos;s the boss of both the victim and our suspect .
he also likes to wear very fancy suits .
i know that because i happen to be
looking at him through the window of my office .
he &apos;s here ?
he just walked in , and he insists on talking to you .
i was on my way to beijing to lock up a contract
when i got the call about scott &apos;s death .
i redirect the flight , only to be told when i land
that brent mercer &apos;s being held as a suspect .
so not only is one of my top @-@ tier employees dead ,
but now another is under arrest .
i need somebody to tell me what the hell is going on .
okay , with all due respect , mr. redding ,
we &apos;re gonna ask the questions , all right ?
of course .
okay , you are brent mercer &apos;s boss .
do you think he &apos;s capable of doing something like this ?
this is a cutthroat business .
my people are very competitive with each other .
in brent &apos;s case ,
scott came in as an intern ,
and he absolutely lapped him ,
but i hired brent .
i trained him myself .
do i think he &apos;s capable of killing scott ? no .
why do you say that ?
brent &apos;s a great employee , but what he doesn &apos;t have
is the fire in his belly .
i &apos;m no psychologist , but i can tell you
that he doesn &apos;t have the balls to kill someone .
looked into brent &apos;s airline ticket .
it was purchased online at 9 : 45 this morning .
ip address traces back to the hotel &apos;s wi @-@ fi .
okay , so unless somebody else used brent &apos;s computer ,
that puts him at the hotel
less than 20 minutes after the murder .
yeah , which means that there &apos;s no way
he could have been back across the island
at the time of death .
okay , well , if this all checks out ,
we &apos;ll be releasing brent shortly .
good , &apos; cause my board is panicked enough as it is .
now i &apos;ve got to get to an emergency meeting
to assure them that these events
won &apos;t take down this company .
wow , that &apos;s , uh ...
i was gonna offer my condolences ,
but please .
i know this sounds cold , detective .
scott davis was a personal friend of mine ,
but to those people , he was just an asset ,
and a valuable one at that .
your field assessment was correct .
c.o.d. was a nine @-@ millimeter gunshot wound
through the back of the head .
however , here &apos;s what &apos;s interesting .
routine tox screen revealed that the victim
had detectable levels of flutoprazepam in his blood .
sorry , fluto what now ?
it &apos;s a hypnotic sedative used as a muscle relaxant
for insomnia treatment .
it works by depressing the central nervous system .
okay , wait . what would davis take a sedative
before going on an intense tactical training exercise ?
well , the real question is why would he take it at all .
according to his medical records ,
it wasn &apos;t prescribed to him ,
and recreational use seems
highly unlikely as a dose that large
would have just knocked him out .
can you tell how long it &apos;s been in his system ?
based on the metabolites ,
it would appear that he ingested them
roughly around 12 hours ago .
okay , i don &apos;t think our victim took a sedative willingly .
i think someone drugged him with it .
hey , steve , it &apos;s kono .
okay , so mercer puts davis at the bar
around the same time he was drugged , right ?
right , maybe somebody dosed him at the bar ,
slipped something in his drink .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking ;
someone drugs this guy at night .
next day he gets shot in the head .
i &apos;m guessing these events are related .
all right . you know this bar we &apos;re going to ?
la mariana tiki bar , yeah .
i &apos;ll drive .
you don &apos;t say .
hey . what the , uh ,
what the hell is this ?
what , i can &apos;t surprise steve at work ?
no , you can do that . i &apos;m talking about the , uh ,
the jersey .
oh , oh , well , we moved around a lot when i was a kid ,
so you know , i never stayed in one place long enough
to get tied to a team .
oh , so you willingly root for the dallas cowboys , huh ?
yeah .
come on . who doesn &apos;t like america &apos;s team ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t .
we don &apos;t .
and , uh , if i recall correctly ,
my redskins humiliated your cowboys
the last time they played .
that &apos;s very cute .
you got a cowboys fan dating a redskins fan .
that &apos;s like the capulets and the montagues .
that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m gonna give you an a plus for that literary reference .
oh , you got that ? thanks .
but actually , um ,
i came here with a peace offering for steve .
see , the nfl hooked up my unit
with some tickets for the game tomorrow .
so ,
you and i are going to the pro bowl .
what ?
i &apos;m already going with danny .
you &apos;re ...
we got 50 yard line seats .
best seats in the house .
we got them this morning . i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s cool . okay .
um , you know what , my seats are @-@ are pretty good .
so i &apos;m sure i can find someone else to take it . it &apos;s good .
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna just let that awkward moment fade out a little bit .
we got a bar to go to .
for a case .
we &apos;re going to a bar for a case .
it &apos;s a case . a bar case .
okay .
hey , why don &apos;t we do some tailgating
before the game together ?
you and me ?
yeah , i would love that .
but i don &apos;t want to get in the way
of your man date with danny .
it &apos;s not a man date .
no .
anyway , kamekona already invited himself ,
so it &apos;s fine ; you &apos;re not getting in the way .
mmm , that &apos;s a three @-@ way bromance .
cute .
it &apos;s very , very cute . i like it . okay .
all right , don &apos;t quote me , but i think i like this place .
yeah , my dad liked it here , too , a lot .
he was a regular .
ladies and gentlemen ,
give it up for the kane of cool ,
hawaii &apos;s very own nicky &quot; the kid &quot; demarco .
the kid ? doesn &apos;t look like a kid .
whatever you do , don &apos;t ask him about his name ,
don &apos;t answer any questions ,
let me do the talking , all right ?
hey . little stevie mcgarrett ,
what &apos;s cooking ?
what &apos;s cooking ?
you &apos;re cooking .
you sound great up there .
thank you . thank you .
hey , nicky , i want you to meet my partner .
this is detective danny williams .
hey , danny , how are you ?
good , how are you ?
you &apos;re not from around here , are you ?
no , i &apos;m from new jersey .
new jersey ?
yeah .
sit down , my boy . i got to talk to you .
okay .
sit down right here .
new jersey .
i used to work with a singer from new jersey
way back in the day .
oh , yeah ?
a fella by the name of francis albert sinatra .
frank sinatra ?
you @-@ you worked with frank sinatra .
yeah .
you know he worked with frank sinatra ?
i @-@ i &apos;ve heard this story once or twice .
yeah , but @-@ but he didn &apos;t .
july 18 , 1965,
frank &apos;s playing the arie crown theater in chicago ,
and his opening act calls in sick .
i &apos;m just a 17 @-@ year @-@ old stagehand ,
but frank turns to me and he says ,
&quot; you &apos;re in , kid . &quot;
i opened the show ,
and i killed them ,
and i &apos;ve been singing as &quot; the kid &quot; ever since .
that &apos;s a great story .
yeah .
so listen , nicky ,
uh , we actually , we need your help in a case .
yeah , sure .
okay .
you see this guy drinking here last night ?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
sure , yeah . he came in solo .
he sat at the bar ,
but he wasn &apos;t drinking alone for long .
holly got to him .
who &apos;s holly ?
close the door .
blond bombshell . she &apos;s got legs up to here .
you know , the word on the street is
she &apos;s got a knack for separating rich guys
from their hard @-@ earned dough .
what do you mean , she &apos;s a hooker ?
no . she &apos;s got an angle ,
but i don &apos;t know what the angle is .
okay , what about her last name ?
you know her name , nicky ?
sorry , but maybe you should talk to isaiah there .
him and holly were pretty chummy .
who &apos;s isaiah ? is he the bouncer ?
that &apos;s right .
you know , she used to lay some pretty big tips on him ,
and i could never figure out why she was so generous .
well , maybe if she &apos;s running scams ,
tipping him , he &apos;s got something to do with it .
he &apos;s in , you know ?
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
frank taught me that .
i thought we were friends , nicky .
actually , i never cared for you .
oh , so you rat me out to the cops ?
all i did was skim cash at the door .
hey , the cover charge is for the talent .
that &apos;s me , you imbecile .
all right , let &apos;s settle down here .
why don &apos;t you tell us , isaiah ,
about this con you &apos;ve been running with holly ?
wh ... it &apos;s not like that .
okay , well , we &apos;re here ; tell us what it &apos;s like .
look , i don &apos;t even know the girl &apos;s real name .
she &apos;s a grifter .
got a nice scam going ripping off rich businessmen .
all i do is tip her off
when one of them &apos;s throwing cash around at the bar .
what she does to the poor saps after
that is up to her .
okay , well , the last poor sap she ran a scam on ended up dead .
his name was scott davis . you know him ?
wait , you talking about the dude she hit up last night ?
because i had nothing to do with that .
hey , you lie to my friends one more time ,
i &apos;ll knock your teeth out . whoa .
you understand me ?
nicky , come on , take a seat .
honestly , this davis guy was all plastic .
no cash .
i figured him for a lousy mark .
so you &apos;re telling us you did not sic holly onto him ?
no way .
i was shocked when she showed up
out of the blue and locked onto that poor mope .
couple drinks later , he &apos;s wasted ,
and she &apos;s helping him out of the bar .
those umbrella drinks are pretty potent .
especially if you add a couple sedatives to them .
you let that broad drug our customers ?
what , are you nuts ?
i &apos;ve never known holly to drug anybody .
girl that fine ?
she &apos;s got no problems
getting dudes to leave with her willingly .
but she was clearly
working off a different script last night .
all right , you might not know her name ,
but you must have a way of getting in contact with her .
text message .
her number &apos;s programmed into my phone .
yeah .
yeah , okay .
all right .
surprise , surprise .
holly &apos;s been using a prepaid cell .
chin and kono are running a trace now .
all right . so what do we think ?
it seems pretty obvious to me
holly &apos;s after one thing , right ?
it &apos;s the cash .
now , all of a sudden ,
she switches up her mo ,
and goes after scott davis .
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
i think somebody used her to get close to him .
okay , i &apos;m thinking that same someone
is behind davis &apos;s murder .
so if we find holly , we find our killer .
okay . i &apos;m here .
looks like a lot of people are checking in
for the game tomorrow .
so where am i going ?
head toward the front desk .
there should be a corridor to the right .
okay .
i &apos;m heading for it now .
gps on holly &apos;s phone puts her up ahead on the left .
there &apos;s no holly ,
but there &apos;s a door marked &quot; security . &quot;
maybe she got pinched pulling one of her scams .
okay , let me call you back .
took you long enough to get here .
hpd told me they were sending a unit an hour ago .
look , that &apos;s not me .
i &apos;m with five @-@ o.
nice .
i &apos;m running down a suspect .
looks like you have her phone .
let me guess ...
tall , blond , a looker ?
yeah , that &apos;s her .
yeah .
girl forgot her phone by the pool .
she was in a real hurry to get out of here
after the incident .
what incident ?
yeah , that &apos;s holly .
who &apos;s the guy she &apos;s with ?
you mean the unsub ?
i wasn &apos;t able to id him .
watched a few cop shows , have you ?
actually , i put an application into hpd .
we might get a chance to work together soon .
look forward to it .
it &apos;s getting pretty heated .
looks like she wants to get out of there .
wait , it gets better .
recognize the good samaritan ?
that &apos;s arian foster .
what , the running back for the texans ?
yeah .
he &apos;s even hotter without the pads and the helmet .
you see peyton ?
okay . we &apos;re supposed to be working .
would you stop stalking peyton manning ?
just if you see him , let me know , please .
please ?
there &apos;s arian foster .
i said i &apos;m ...
not really comfortable with that , man .
but we all want to see you do it .
do it ! do it ! do it !
namaste .
thanks !
i really appreciate the love , man ,
but a touchdown ritual , and what i do
in the end zone is kind of , like , sacred .
so i like to keep it on the field , you understand ?
arian .
you &apos;re welcome .
steve mcgarrett , five @-@ o. we &apos;d like you
to answer some questions .
all right .
originally , i was just trying to help the girl out .
but ... he took a swing at me ,
so , you know , i had to defend myself .
but , you know , after that , they both left
okay . um , by any chance did you catch
either of their names ?
or maybe hear
what they were arguing about ?
no , not really .
the guy was kind of trying to avoid a scene .
and , um , she was pretty hot about something .
but i do remember her saying
something , like , along the lines of ,
&quot; what are you trying to get me caught up in ? &quot;
or , you know , something like that .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t be any more of ...
no , no , no . it &apos;s cool , man . y @-@ you &apos;ve been very helpful .
appreciate it .
actually , um ,
i @-@ i have one question , if that &apos;s okay .
yeah , man .
okay , uh , week 11,
you guys are playing the jaguars ,
you took a handoff and ran out the outside
about three yards , three , four yards , and then ...
you kind of got hit but you kind of didn &apos;t get hit and y @-@ you
let the ball go . you fumbled the ball .
and i was just curious if you remember
how that happened or why that happened or ...
you serious ?
are you serious ?
i ... oh , i ... i &apos;m serious , yeah .
well , officer , um ,
i carried the ball over 350 times this year , um ...
and you &apos;re asking me about one of the two fumbles
i lost all year ?
no . i @-@ it &apos;s just that that , um ... that possession ,
it really burned in my memory , you see ,
because i had you in my fantasy football league ,
and if y @-@ you didn &apos;t drop that ball ,
i would &apos;ve won the championship , so it was very ...
with all due respect , officer , you should let that one go .
he should .
you &apos;re probably right .
thank you again , man .
appreciate it .
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s a nice ring . tell me about that .
thanks , man .
not a super bowl ring , right ?
okay .
it &apos;s all day .
i &apos;m sorry .
uh , well , officer , this is
a class ring . i got it when i was , um ...
when i was playing college .
by any chance , were you wearing that
when you got into it with these suspects ?
yeah , why ?
hey , charlie , mcgarrett .
listen , we got a piece of evidence
we need you to run for dna .
we &apos;re bringing it down now .
you know , i can &apos;t believe you embarrassed yourself
like that back there .
uh , foster &apos;s the one who should be embarrassed , okay ?
i &apos;m not the one who fumbled that ball .
he holds onto that ball , and i am a fantasy champion .
instead you &apos;re a real @-@ life imbecile .
are you kidding me ? okay , it &apos;s easy to criticize these guys
from the comfort of your couch .
it &apos;s a little harder when you &apos;re on the field
and there &apos;s a linebacker coming at you like a freight train .
okay ,
you don &apos;t understand . you don &apos;t play fantasy football .
no , you &apos;re right . i was too busy playing real football .
okay , what i do takes skill .
okay ? you got to know who to draft ,
you got to know who to trade , you got to work the waiver wire .
there &apos;s a lot of things that go into it , see . okay ,
huh .
does it involve throwing , catching or making a tackle ?
no .
well , that &apos;s because
it &apos;s dungeons &amp; dragons
for sports geeks ,
okay ? so , in the words of arian foster ,
you need to let this go .
our friend holly ,
she &apos;s been pretty active lately .
her picture turned up in
a bunch of open hpd investigations .
okay . we get a name ?
yeah . ten of &apos; em .
all aliases .
but the good news is we got an i.d.
on the guy she was meeting with this morning .
the dna from the ring came back to a timothy cross .
he &apos;s in the system for b and e and extortion .
back in &apos; 08 , cross got popped
trying to blackmail a federal judge in california ,
and , uh , he was released
from san quentin six months ago .
that makes sense . a guy with a background like this
shows up in hawaii , hooks up with a local grifter @-@ type chick .
yeah , and speaking of cross &apos; background ,
uh , before he turned to a life of crime ,
he was an officer in the army .
he had quite a career
before he was dishonorably discharged .
10th special forces group .
okay , well , this guy &apos;s definitely got the skill set
to pull off the shooting .
and that &apos;s not all .
according to cross &apos; file ,
he &apos;s six feet , 185 pounds .
that &apos;s the same height and build as our shooter .
all right , so cross goes after holly
to run this con on davis . obviously she doesn &apos;t know
that it &apos;s gonna end up in a murder beef .
makes sense why she flipped out on him
by the pool today .
looks like cross just graduated from extortion to murder .
why would i want to run around
playing soldier with a bunch of wannabe action heroes ?
&apos;cause it was a perfect opportunity
to take out the target .
yeah , you just walk right up to him with a mask on ,
shoot him point @-@ blank in the head . by the time
anybody realizes he &apos;s dead , you &apos;re long gone .
so you &apos;re saying that &apos;s me ?
&apos;cause all i see is a grainy picture
of someone in a mask .
nice try .
no , really .
i didn &apos;t kill anybody .
i don &apos;t even know who this davis guy is .
who said his name was davis ?
let me guess .
you &apos;re gonna say that &apos;s not you either .
listen , we know you were running a con
on scott davis , okay ?
and that you used holly to drug him .
given your history , i &apos;m thinking it was a blackmail attempt .
is that right ?
so what happened ?
davis threatened to go to the cops
and you had to kill him ?
it &apos;s not like that .
well , why don &apos;t you tell us what it &apos;s like .
look , i &apos;ll admit to targeting the guy ,
but it wasn &apos;t over blackmail .
i &apos;ve been out of that game for years .
so what &apos;s your game now ?
intelligence gathering .
i got a knack for obtaining information
that isn &apos;t available through legal means .
in this case , a client
hired me to steal ardus &apos;s intellectual property .
all right , so you figured scott davis
was the guy to go to for that ,
and you used holly to get close to him .
girl &apos;s got a nice scam going--
getting guys back to their rooms so she can rob them .
all she had to do this time
was copy the data from davis &apos;s laptop onto a flash drive .
i gave her a sedative to slip him at the bar
and 20 grand for her trouble .
so that &apos;s why you were meeting yesterday--
she was supposed to hand you over the flash drive .
but ...
we all know how that went , huh ?
holly had seen on tv that davis was dead .
she got spooked , thought i was involved .
and before i could talk her down and
get the drive from her ,
some hero stepped in and clocked me .
now i &apos;m out $ 20k , i have no flash drive .
my clients aren &apos;t gonna be too happy about that .
why don &apos;t you give us their names ?
we &apos;ll call and apologize for you .
i wish i could .
but i don &apos;t even know who they are .
it &apos;s all arranged through double @-@ blind contacts .
these wall street @-@ types ,
they &apos;re good at avoiding jail time .
they might be .
you &apos;re not .
yeah .
look , i &apos;ve , uh ...
i suppose i have violated one or two conditions of my parole ,
but there is no way i &apos;m eating a murder charge .
koali day spa .
that &apos;s where i was yesterday morning when davis was shot .
the masseuse mostly focused on my glutes ,
but i &apos;m guessing she &apos;ll remember my face .
okay , so , cross &apos; alibi checks out--
spa confirmed he was there yesterday from 8 : 00 to 10 : 00 .
yeah , i was listening in on the interrogation .
so , cross hired holly
to get the data off of davis &apos;s computer .
but when hpd searched the hotel room ,
there was no laptop in there .
wait a minute .
we know that holly dumped the data onto a flash drive .
the only reason she would do that
is if she was leaving the laptop behind .
right .
which means
someone else must &apos;ve stolen it
from davis &apos;s room after the murder .
i think i might know what they were looking for .
i dug into ardus &apos;s financials .
turns out they were heavily invested
in a next @-@ gen mobile chipset that was developed by davis .
rumor is this could be a billion @-@ dollar product .
well , that would explain why cross &apos; client
was willing to engage in corporate espionage
to get the data off scott davis &apos;s computer .
and why someone else might be willing to kill for it .
hey . all right , so i just got off the phone
with the clerk &apos;s office .
one of holly &apos;s aliases traces back
to an address on waipahu .
deed goes back seven years , well before her grifting days .
check this out . check this out .
check this out . make it happen , please .
thank you .
that &apos;s her .
holly &apos;s real name is lana sullivan .
cath , what &apos;s up ?
hey , you tell me .
kickoff &apos;s in an hour . you gonna make it ?
yes , we are going to make it .
we &apos;re ... listen , i know i said we were gonna hang out ,
but we &apos;re kinda tied up with this case .
well , you &apos;re missing quite a scene .
for the record , i can eat grilled spam
any day of the week here , okay ?
i am not missing my opportunity to meet a living legend , okay ?
all right . well , if you guys make it here ,
i &apos;ll try to find you during halftime , okay ?
ok . sounds good . see you soon .
all right , we found holly .
lana .
whatever .
hey ! hey , five @-@ o.
hey , hey , don &apos;t move ! hey !
hey . back up .
who the hell are you ?
beth sullivan .
you look a lot like your sister lana .
i presume that &apos;s how you &apos;re related ?
okay , where &apos;s lana ?
what are you looking at ?
she seems a lot more interested in something
on this desk than talking to us .
please ,
i &apos;m just trying to protect my sister .
protect your sister from what ?
hey . this is a copy of scott davis &apos;s hard drive .
why were you about to send this to the honolulu times ?
i told her not to do it ,
that it was dangerous , but ...
do what ? what was she gonna do ?
she said she found a buyer ,
somebody willing to pay for what was on that guy &apos;s hard drive .
she &apos;s on her way to meet him now .
okay , so this e @-@ mail is her insurance policy .
if i don &apos;t hear from her by 2 : 00,
i &apos;m supposed to send the file to the press .
okay , where &apos;s the meeting supposed to be ?
you &apos;ll just arrest her .
that &apos;s better than what the buyer might do to her . okay ,
somebody &apos;s already been killed over the data on that computer .
you want to put your sister in that kind of danger ?
so tell us , where is she ?
so , i dug through the copy of davis &apos;s hard drive
you sent over ,
and found an e @-@ mail thread
between him and his boss , neil redding .
turns out that for months he has been warning redding
that the chipset that ardus was developing wasn &apos;t viable .
wait a minute , this guy stakes his entire company
on this new technology ,
millions of dollars in r &amp; d
and the thing doesn &apos;t even work ?
exactly . and when wall street gets wind of this ,
that &apos;ll be the end of ardus .
okay , but there &apos;s nothing redding can do to stop that .
i mean , even if he silences davis ,
he &apos;s only gonna buy some time , right ? so why kill him ?
here &apos;s why .
i finally heard back from ardus &apos;s insurance carrier .
they held a $ 30 million
&quot; key person &quot; life policy on davis .
these policies cover high @-@ level employees
who are considered essential to a company &apos;s success .
okay , so davis is worth more
to redding dead than alive .
right .
hey , guys . okay ,
so , redding &apos;s office said
he was en route to california ,
so i dispatched sfpd to pick him up at the airport ,
but when his plane arrived , he wasn &apos;t on it .
that &apos;s great . so where the hell is he ?
here . the pilot copped to forging
the flight manifest to and from honolulu .
redding &apos;s actually been on the island for the past 48 hours .
that means he was here when davis was killed .
okay , so redding kills davis for the insurance payout ,
and uses the forged flight manifest as his alibi .
yeah , but there &apos;s no way he could &apos;ve predicted
that one of ardus &apos;s rivals would hire cross
to clone davis &apos;s laptop .
okay , and now
with these incriminating e @-@ mails out there in the world ,
redding has one last loose end to tie up .
i believe you have something for me .
i do if you brought the cash .
it &apos;s close by , but i want to see what i &apos;m buying first .
a little advice : next time you steal something ,
don &apos;t try selling it back to the people you took it from .
not that there &apos;s gonna be a next time .
start walking .
you think i &apos;m stupid , don &apos;t you ?
the thought crossed my mind .
i took a look at what was on that drive--
i know what you &apos;re trying to hide .
yeah , i figured as much ,
and that &apos;s why you &apos;ll be going off the pier , too .
well , here &apos;s what you don &apos;t know .
if i don &apos;t make a call in the next 15 minutes ,
everything that &apos;s on that flash drive goes public .
front page news by morning .
who &apos;s stupid now ?
five @-@ o !
up .
you all right ?
wow . buddy , i , uh ...
i don &apos;t think your shoulder &apos;s supposed to look like that .
these guys have got to take me to king &apos;s to set my arm .
just go already . you &apos;re gonna miss the kickoff .
what are you doing ?
what i &apos;m doing , i &apos;m ...
making sure these prime ,
once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime seats don &apos;t go to waste .
hey , it &apos;s a good thing your friends couldn &apos;t make it , huh ?
mm . you realize this is not that kind of football , right ?
i &apos;m being ironic .
ironic .
glad you could make it , chin .
i thought kono was gonna join us .
she was .
but she got a better offer .
oh ! go !
go ! go ! go ! go !
on three , right ?
that &apos;s right .
one , two , three .
i got it , i got it , i got it , ai !
fourth and goal . there &apos;s the snap .
manning drops back in the pocket . throws over the middle
and it &apos;s caught by a.j. green for a touchdown !
yay , a touchdown . that &apos;s so great .
so great to be there . it would &apos;ve been fun .
you got to be kidding me .
you got to ... you got to be kidding me .
i know those two girls .
i @-@ i could have been ...
you believe where we are , danny ?
pretty incredible , right ?
huh ? what do you think ?
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s amazing .
it &apos;s amazing , right ?
i mean , i think it &apos;d be a little more impressive , uh ,
with 50,000 people in the stands ,
the greatest athletes of all time on the field , but it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s nice like this ; i like this .
this is ... this is nice .
i &apos;m sorry that you had to miss the game because of me . i am .
but look at it this way--
next year peyton manning &apos;s , like ,
he &apos;s virtually a lock for the pro bowl team again , right ?
all right , we &apos;ve got the field for ten minutes ,
and then they got to cover it up .
okay . thanks for making it happen .
no problem .
uh , listen , peyton said he was sorry .
he really wanted to meet you , but he had a plane to catch .
pey @-@ peyton ?
you guys are on a first @-@ name basis now ?
kind of .
we had a talk after the game ,
and i told him that you were a huge fan
and that you had to miss the game because of a case , and , uh ,
he wanted me to give you this .
okay , that &apos;s awesome .
that &apos;s awesome .
that &apos;s really great . thank you .
welcome .
um , what &apos;s he like ?
oh , okay , he &apos;s so nice .
and really tall .
like ... tall .
well , he &apos;s got to get over the line .
should i be jealous ?
you should be jealous .
he &apos;s a , um , four @-@ time mvp ,
super bowl champion , future hall @-@ of @-@ famer .
should you be jealous ?
okay , besides that , what &apos;s he done ?
what &apos;s he done ?
yeah , what &apos;s he done ?
he hosted saturday night live , does a lot of charity work ,
works with kids .
he , uh , gave me this football .
we should throw that . let &apos;s throw the ball .
that @-@ that right there is an autographed ball .
when &apos;s he gonna get a chance to catch a pass
on an actual nfl field ? look at this .
let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s my ball .
okay .
so i make the decision , right ?
all right .
okay , okay . all right , you want me to run a post ?
easy out . i can run a fly . square in , square out .
why don &apos;t you run , i &apos;ll throw you the ball .
you like the &quot; go route , &quot; then . okay .
that &apos;s awesome .
all right , you ready ?
you &apos;re gonna do it , do it right .
