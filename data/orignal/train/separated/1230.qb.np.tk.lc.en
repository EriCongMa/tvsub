i &apos;m sara harvey .
so when do we tell the police about charles ?
we don &apos;t .
we don &apos;t ?
they &apos;ll know andrew is charles when they find him .
what happened to you ?
he just played games with us .
who do you love more , me or her ?
who deserves water today ?
we all want the person who did that to you punished .
it was andrew . it has to be andrew .
they &apos;re supposed to give me an anti @-@ anxiety medication
to help me sleep .
i asked them not to .
i need that prescription .
no , you want it . there &apos;s a difference .
that guy they caught ..
andrew .
are you sure it &apos;s him ?
do we have a charles dilaurentis in our family ?
no charles dilaurentis in this family .
your father &apos;s a liar .
did she say anything more ?
just that , when she saw andrew on the news
she didn &apos;t think he was the one who kept her down there .
okay , well , details , emily ?
did she give you any details ? why is she sure ?
she &apos;s not sure @-@ sure , just pretty sure .
was it the way that he walked , or the sound of his breathing ?
she didn &apos;t say .
where is she now ?
takin &apos; a shower . she takes a lot of showers .
yeah , i know the feeling .
spencer , sara was trapped for over two years .
andrew was in school with us the whole time .
yeah , well , mona was stalking the halls when she was a.
it didn &apos;t exactly cramp her style .
mona didn &apos;t have someone caged up like an animal .
yeah , i know .
you can &apos;t exactly ask for a hall pass
to go feed your hostage .
look , i know , i may have screwed up with the police
but i still think that andrew is charles .
i &apos;m just telling you what she said .
spencer thinks--
it has to be andrew .
because if it &apos;s not , we &apos;re right back where we started
and i @-@ i am not going back there .
are you going to school ?
hell yes , i &apos;m going to school .
do you think mona will be there ?
mona &apos;s mom took her out of town .
i think they &apos;re in saratoga .
what about sara ?
what about her ?
what she told emily about andrew .
he was everywhere , aria . you said it yourself .
&apos;he managed to be around the corner from so much.&apos;

安德鲁 · 坎贝尔

i &apos;ll just put my number on speed @-@ dial .
you can text me if you want to .
i guess i &apos;ll have to go back ... to school .
the only way people know me is from the news .
i saw a story .
they described me as feral .
did you think i looked feral ?
not feral , um ..
... more like a lost puppy .
you just needed some grooming .
um ... i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i shouldn &apos;t have come here .
i ... i should &apos;ve just toughed it out at home .
is your mom angry that i came here ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t want to make your mom angry .
no @-@ no @-@ no , no . no one is angry at you .
i &apos;ll tell you what ..
... why don &apos;t the three of us have breakfast together ?
i thought you were going to school .
i @-@ i can go tomorrow .
we have french toast to make this morning .
what &apos;s that for ?
comfort food .
oh , you &apos;re a very attentive host .
no , i don &apos;t do this for every customer .
just the ones that order coffee to go and then don &apos;t go .
yeah , i @-@ i just thought that i &apos;d sit here for a minute
before i walk to school .
you and the others are going back today ?
yes .
are you ready for that ?
no .
then don &apos;t go .
play hooky . you &apos;re entitled to .
i don &apos;t wanna hide in my house all day .
you can stay here .
you can use the desk in the back .
you can write .
no writing .
you can not write .
you can read , doodle
alphabetize the spice shelf , anything .
you &apos;re safe here . i promise .
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
i told you what my father said .
you have to ask him again . you have to make him tell you .
he looked at me and said that there was no such person
as charles dilaurentis in our family .
ali , your father is lying to you !
a didn &apos;t just pick that name out of the air .
a is for andrew .
then why put the name
charles dilaurentis right in front of us ?
hidden , but hidden just enough .
why did he want us to find it ?
look , if this person is real
and my dad knows who it is
he &apos;d be down at the police station right now .
i really wish i was as sure of that as you are .
if you actually are that sure .
i think you should go now .
i &apos;m going to talk to jason .
no .
leave him out of it .
he &apos;s messed up enough because of all this .
then he has a right to know and maybe get un @-@ messed .
he &apos;s my brother too . our families are connected .
they &apos;re more than just connected they &apos;re all tangled up
like necklaces in the bottom of your jewelry box .
leave him alone .
i don &apos;t want anybody else hating me .
what makes you think he &apos;s gonna hate you ?
because that &apos;s how it works .
i &apos;m under every stone that somebody turns over .
i make people into people that they never were .
it &apos;s all my fault .
i saw you and em and aria and hanna in that place
that sick place , and i knew
i was why you were there .
it always comes down to me .
and everyone would be fine without me .
god , ali , no , it &apos;s not like that .
you think it yourself .
no , i don &apos;t .
you &apos;ve reached spencer . leave a ..
hanna ?
dr. sullivan .
i &apos;m so glad to see you here .
i called , did your mother tell you ?
yeah , yeah , she did . that was really nice .
i gave her some names of some people you might wanna talk to .
thanks .
and you decided to come back to school ?
yeah .
are the others here ?
uh , not yet . just me .
well , i &apos;m here consulting with
the school counselors two days a week .
if you &apos;d like stop by ..
okay .
please , stop by .
thanks .
who are you ?
how you doin &apos; ?
yeah . i &apos;m okay .
good . uh , here &apos;s a tip .
if you don &apos;t want somebody knowing
that you &apos;re hiding something from them , don &apos;t hide it .
maybe i wasn &apos;t really hiding it .
who is he ?
really ?
i trusted him , and all i know is what he told me .
what do you wanna know ?
i think the thing that a ...
andrew hated the most was that we were friends .
aria , spencer , emily and me .
like ruining that was the big win and ...
maybe it was .
how ?
the dark
the cold , being hungry ..
that was bad enough .
but there was something else going on .
&apos;choose one.&apos;
hanna , how do you feel about scheduling some time together ?
well , it can &apos;t just be me .
i mean , it has to be the four of us .
i can &apos;t force the others into a group session .
well , you &apos;re a doctor . can &apos;t you subpoena them ?
it doesn &apos;t work like that .
but if you can get them all to come to my office
i &apos;ll find time for you .
i &apos;ll make it happen .
hi , is @-@ is the doctor available
to talk to the rosewood police department ?
oh , alright .
please hold for detective mervin .
it &apos;s the nurse .
hello , this is detective mervin , is this dr. fenton ?
oh , no , that &apos;s alright , you could help me .
um , we have a patient here of the doctor &apos;s one andrew campbell ,
we just wanted to check and make sure our information is correct
so that he &apos;s properly cared for .
well , any prescription drugs he should be taking
any medical history that we should to be aware of , um ...
why don &apos;t , why don &apos;t we start with the basics ?
can you confirm his date and place of birth
and social security number ?
right .
no , that &apos;s alright . um , i understand .
we will contact the parents . thank you so much .
you didn &apos;t get anything , did you ?
can &apos;t give out medical information over the phone .
but ... as for his date of birth , and where he was born
that information is sealed .
sealed ? sealed where ?
with the rest of his aption records .
hey , lady .
can we get our ball back ?
nice kick .
you got great control .
thank you .
are those boys all from church ?
not all .
it &apos;s a church program , but any kid can join .
where are the girls ?
co @-@ ed doesn &apos;t work well at this age .
they &apos;re starting to notice certain distinctions .
so the girls lose out ? that &apos;s not fair .
oh , we had a group for girls
but , uh , they lost their youth leader .
can &apos;t have a program without proper supervision .
that &apos;s too bad .
would you like to volunteer ?
for what ?
to run the girls &apos; soccer program .
you &apos;ve got the moves .
i &apos;m talking about your kick .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a very good idea .
why not ?
being a leader of girls
that hasn &apos;t worked out well for me .
maybe that &apos;s somethin &apos; you can talk to them about .
there are mothers in this town
who wouldn &apos;t appreciate me supervising their daughters .
why don &apos;t you let me worry about them ?
you don &apos;t take no for an answer , do you ?
not if it can be avoided , no .
up until by the age of 12
emily &apos;s closet was done in early hurricane .
then came the glorious day she discovered hangers .
okay .
it &apos;s true .
you &apos;re probably just gonna start all over , right ?
i mean , clear out your closet and get all new things .
i sort of have to .
have to ?
my mom gave away all my stuff .
not right away , she ..
said she waited a year .
then she packed it up and gave it away .
well , it was probably really hard for her
to have all your things around .
she said she needed the space .
you can have whatever fits .
and there &apos;s more stuff in the attic .
yeah , a lot more .
you ran away from home ?
mom .
that &apos;s okay .
yeah , i ran away .
why ?
just couldn &apos;t do it anymore .
couldn &apos;t do what ?
pretend to be happy .
pretend everything was gonna be okay .
pretend my dad would come back , and ..
he &apos;d be different if he did .
i &apos;m really sorry .
not your fault .
i &apos;m still sorry . and a little bit angry .
you know what ? i think that you should try this one again .
it looks really nice . the color should be good for you .
thanks .
hanna , i &apos;m sorry .
i meant to call , i just .. i couldn &apos;t make it .
where are you ?
i have to .. i have to ask you a favor .
name it .
i need you to talk to ali .
talk to ali about what ?
about keeping away from lorenzo .
your partner ? what does he have to do with alison ?
nothing yet . i wanna keep it that way .
what makes you think ali &apos;s interested in lorenzo ?
i saw them together .
that &apos;s his business , isn &apos;t it ?
his and ali &apos;s .
we &apos;re not talking about just anybody here .
we &apos;re talking about alison .
you know , people can change .
she helped you find us .
right , &apos; cause she needed you and mona alive .
she was looking out for ali , that &apos;s what she always does .
so that &apos;s it , she just reverts back
to who she was before all this happened ?
look , i wanna trust her , believe me .
but you know she has a history with cops
and anybody else she can use .
lorenzo doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s capable of , we do .
if you can tell me you completely trust her
i &apos;ll drop this whole thing .
come on , get in the car .
i can &apos;t . sara &apos;s upstairs .
em , get in the car . we &apos;re gonna go see dr. sullivan .
dr. sullivan ?
yeah , i &apos;m declaring an intervention .
if you wanna talk to dr. sullivan , that &apos;s your business .
no , it &apos;s all of our business and you know that .
well , i can &apos;t , i have to take care of sara .
good , you got the text .
yeah , i got it . but listen--
now all we need is spencer .
no , listen , i got it confirmed .
andrew campbell was adopted .
confirmed ? how ?
ezra helped me .
wait , you didn &apos;t tell him about charles , did you ?
no , of course not .
you guys , look , the point is we know for sure .
andrew was adopted ,
which means he might be older than we think he is .
he could be that other kid in the home movie .
wait , so before he was a campbell
maybe he was a dilaurentis .
you probably heard , my dad is trying to decide
how many people he can sue at one time .
it &apos;s the kinda challenge he enjoys .
i wanted to talk to you about him .
about your family .
our family .
well , i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever heard you
refer to it as our family .
well , things change .
when we were down there in that place , we saw a name .
we found it or
andrew wanted us to find it .
but either way , we have a name now .
and we don &apos;t know what it means .
what name ?
charles dilaurentis .
we haven &apos;t gone to the police yet .
why not ?
&apos;cause we wanna know what it meant
before we gave it to them .
and ali asked your dad
but he said that there was no such person .
i don &apos;t know any charles dilaurentis either .
not even a cousin somewhere ?
not on our side of the family .
look , andrew must have done it just to mess with ali .
汉娜
i have to go .
see you later .
charles dilaurentis ?
you do know the name .
uh , no , not really . it &apos;s a coincidence .
what is ?
charlie .
charlie dilaurentis ?
just charlie .
but my dad told you the truth .
about what ?
charlie doesn &apos;t exist .
it &apos;s nice to see all of you again .
good to see you .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;ll could make it .
i told you we would .
is spencer coming ?
we don &apos;t know .
she &apos;ll be here .
okay , well i &apos;ve cleared some time
but let me take care of this phone call first .
i &apos;ll be just a minute .
thanks .
so what are we supposed to tell her ?
it &apos;s not about telling her
it &apos;s about telling each other .
hanna , i think sometimes it &apos;s better
not to talk about things .
really , em ? how have you been sleeping ?
guys , we shouldn &apos;t do this without spencer .
she &apos;ll be here .
are you sure ?
you guys , we need to talk .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
no , i mean we have to talk .
jason told me who charles dilaurentis is .
wait , so , he knew , but ali didn &apos;t ?
was alison lying ?
it wasn &apos;t charles .
at least not when jason knew him . it was charlie .
they were friends when they were little .
so charlie grew up to be charles ?
charlie was jason &apos;s imaginary friend .
imaginary , like mr. biscuit ?
long story .
wait , jason told you this ?
yes .
and then one day , mr. dilaurentis went to jason
and said that charlie had to go away .
and then jason never saw charlie again .
wait , wait a minute , so ... if jason &apos;s dad
knew that charlie was jason &apos;s imaginary friend
why wouldn &apos;t he just tell alison that when she asked him ?
yeah , why not ?
wait , so those home movies
those were movies of jason and charlie ?
there &apos;s nothing imaginary about charles
and ali &apos;s dad knows it .
yeah , hanna &apos;s right , we have to tell sullivan everything .
it &apos;s sara . i @-@ i gave her one of caleb &apos;s phones .
okay , can you please send that to voicemail ?
no , it &apos;s a face chat request .
wait .
if that &apos;s sara , who &apos;s sending this ?
你们只有三十秒的时间离开那里
yes , i will see you at your session on tuesday .
okay .
where is she ?
hello .
so how are things with sara ?
emily will explain it to her .
without telling her what was on the phone ?
no , it won &apos;t do her any good to scare her with that .
if a is charles , and charles is andrew
and andrew is in jail , then who made that call ?
who was in the room with sara ?
did mr. biscuit ever make any threatening phone calls ?
leave mr. biscuit out of this .
hi , mrs. fields .
oh , girls .
where &apos;s em ?
she &apos;s upstairs with sara .
okay . good .
is something wrong ?
this isn &apos;t official but ..
i was just at the police station visiting and ..
they &apos;re gonna release andrew campbell .
release him ?
wait , did he make bail ?
he doesn &apos;t have to make bail
they &apos;re not charging him with anything .
wh @-@ what do you mean they &apos;re not charging him ?
well , i got this secondhand , but ..
there &apos;s no case .
he has an alibi for when mona was taken from her house .
and he was having his appendix removed the weekend
sara harvey was kidnapped .
so if they don &apos;t think that he did it ..
then that person is still out there .
and you girls need to take precautions .
when was andrew released ?
he hasn &apos;t been yet .
they still have to process him and wait for his family .
&apos;he should be out in a few hours.&apos;
you girls need to check in with your parents and ..
let &apos; em know what &apos;s happening .
yeah , we will .
okay .
why did you ask when andrew was released ?
because , if he was out , he could &apos;ve made that call .
well , he wasn &apos;t . so now what ?
do you have any ideas how crazy that sounds ?
trust me , we know exactly how crazy it sounds .
jason never told you anything about charlie ?
no .
he said your dad knows all about it .
your dad was the one who told jason
that charlie had to go away .
ali , your dad lied to you .
jason always said that something was missing from this family .
i always thought that he was talking about himself ..
being left out of things like photo albums .
but maybe he wasn &apos;t the one that was removed .
ali , do you think there could be proof
of charles dilaurentis in this house ?
guys , we &apos;ve been through this house with a map .
yeah , but we weren &apos;t looking for charlie .
you were looking for my hiding places , not my parents .
there &apos;s nothing in here either .
come with me .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry .
it was very rude and we &apos;re all very sorry .
but we had these emergencies come up .
no , i understand if it was an emergency .
but you all had emergencies ?
no .
no , we all had the same emergency .
my mom slipped in the shower .
we think it was the soap .
is she alright ?
yeah , she &apos;s fine .
tempest in a tea bag .
do you girls wanna make another appointment ?
yeah , that &apos;d be great . i &apos;ll call you tomorrow , okay ?
if we don &apos;t find anything here , we &apos;ll look in the garden .
starting with the azaleas .
really ?
where do you hide things , spence ?
under your mattress , in that big barn of yours ?
no , i have a ... loose floorboard in my closet .
that &apos;s always good .
yeah .
toby is not gonna like this .
why not ?
he thought you were safe so he could go back to hating me .
he doesn &apos;t hate you .
have you met his new partner ?
lorenzo ?
no , not yet .
he &apos;s nice .
yeah , toby likes him .
toby must have ... told him all about me .
just as well .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
has toby talked to lorenzo about me ?
i don &apos;t know .
where did you meet him ?
lorenzo ?
toby was with him .
and then i saw him again ... at church .
don &apos;t laugh .
i &apos;m not laughing .
i &apos;m just .. i &apos;m a little bit surprised .
it &apos;s pointless , right ?
me with somebody like that .
i mean , that could never go anywhere .
could it ?
where would you want it to go ?
you know , ali , there &apos;s a version of this
where we could &apos;ve all been killed .
but we weren &apos;t . so it &apos;s like a second chance .
and i don &apos;t know anybody who couldn &apos;t use one of those .
as long as we don &apos;t waste it .
that &apos;s the same place in the home movie .
the one in the dollhouse .
so one of those boys is jason .
and the other one &apos;s charlie .
the boy who never was .
you &apos;re smart , aria .
i never would have thought to look in the button jar .
yeah , well , it &apos;s where i used to hide my candy money
from mike .
my dad &apos;s gonna be home soon .
you should probably go .
maybe we shouldn &apos;t leave you alone right now .
no , it &apos;ll be okay .
i &apos;ll find out what all this means and then i &apos;ll call you .
let &apos;s go .
someone should stay with her .
she has to do this alone .
her dad wasn &apos;t gonna say anything in front of us .
oh , god .
i guess they processed him .
aria , maybe you shouldn &apos;t .
andrew .
stay away from me .
are your parents inside ?
they called them .
i wasn &apos;t staying in there to wait .
look , i &apos;m really glad you &apos;re out .
really ? that &apos;s not what i heard .
you have to understand--
no , you have to understand .
do you know where i was , the three weeks
they were trying to find me ?
looking for you .
i was gonna be the hero .
instead i get arrested , thrown in jail .
they investigated parents , tear up my uncle &apos;s farm
because i wanted to help you .
because i didn &apos;t believe what people said
about you and your friends .
just let me explain ...
don &apos;t .
just don &apos;t .
we graduate in three weeks .
all you have to do is stay out of my way .
you &apos;ll graduate ..
that doesn &apos;t mean we will .
oh , you &apos;ll graduate .
the school wants you gone as much as the rest of us .
you &apos;ll graduate with honors .
andrew , you need a lift ?
like i &apos;m getting in a car with you two .
no , thank you .
other towns have nice toxic dumps .
rosewood has you .
so i guess you heard him .
we heard .
we &apos;re just gonna go check in , then we can drive you home .
thanks .
hey . are you lorenzo ?
yeah , i &apos;m lorenzo .
i &apos;m spencer .
i figured that &apos;s who you were .
uh , this is aria , emily and hanna .
we &apos;re alison &apos;s friends .
nice to meet you .
you too .
come on .
andrew &apos;s not gonna blame you forever .
why not ? it &apos;s my fault .
he was set up .
it wasn &apos;t just andrew , we all were .
hmm . worse than ever .
people actually know what happened
but they don &apos;t believe us , do they ?
now we &apos;re more cut @-@ off than ever .
that &apos;s what charles really wanted to do
to us in that dollhouse ...
make us feel alone forever .
isolated .
when i was in that place ..
charlie , charles , whoever it was ..
he made me play a game ..
with switches .
about hurting people .
i thought that i was the only one .
but i , i was never shocked .
were any of you ever shocked ?
no .
he tricked us .
the point was that we thought we hurt each other .
that was what charles really wanted us to know .
that there was a point that we would do it .
any of us .
all of us .
it doesn &apos;t look that bad , does it ?
your mom helped .
we were talkin &apos; and one thing lead to another .
what do you think ?
i called you .
toby gave me a ride home
in the back of his police car , okay ?
all safe and sound .
andrew campbell &apos;s been released .
charges dropped .
i know .
the police patrols will be coming back for protection .
but i @-@ i don &apos;t want you going anywhere
without me knowing where you are .
i think i &apos;m gonna try to sleep on my own tonight .
apparently , when they questioned andrew
he said a few things about you and the other girls .
how you all tricked him into helping you .
i bet the police loved that story .
is it true ?
it &apos;s made up of facts ..
that doesn &apos;t make it true .
how was it ..
going back to school ?
don &apos;t do that .
don &apos;t do what ?
don &apos;t try to catch me in a lie , it &apos;s humiliating .
i am trying to keep you safe .
if it wasn &apos;t andrew , then , that means whoever did this to you
is still out there , is still a threat .
god , i wanna put an end to this whole thing
once and for all .
i don &apos;t think you wanna put an end to this
so much as you wish it never happened .
well , it did happen .
it happened to me , and it happened to my friends
and that is not something that gets forgotten . ever .
you know , when i was down there , i just ..
i kept thinking , if we could just make it out
if we could just survive , and get out and come back home
then everything was gonna be alright .
and then , we did .
we &apos;re back .
and i don &apos;t see a happy ending coming anytime soon .
i really wish i did .
goodnight , mom .
what &apos;s the matter ?
we have some questions
and we want answers , not lies .
don &apos;t talk to me like that .
not after what you &apos;ve put this family through .
what i &apos;ve done ?
jason , you don &apos;t understand .
stop .
you &apos;re not gonna get out of this
by picking a fight with jason .
it &apos;s not gonna work . not this time .
i am not gonna be interrogated in my own house by you two .
who is the other boy in this photo ?
