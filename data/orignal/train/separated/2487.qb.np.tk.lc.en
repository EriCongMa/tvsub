强制参加
children , you &apos;re in for a treat .
today &apos;s assembly is devoted
to a special kind of history .
living history .
end this madness !
we have two guests who have come from springfield !
we come from springfield !
illinois ! 1858 .
please welcome , here to debate the important issues of the day ,
stephen douglas and abraham lincoln !
i appear before you today for the purpose
of discussing the leading political topics
which now agitate the public mind .
hit the dirt , squirt !
well , it seems the , uh ... the good landowners
of springfield elementary are rejecting
mr. douglas &apos;s position on tariffs .
get a room !
i shared beds with men all the time .
it was a common practice .
ooh , common practice .
please , good people !
these are times of powerful passion .
why are you concussing yourself ?
why are you concussing yourself ?
now , fellow countrymen ,
a house divided against itself ...
guess what , i also play frankenstein !
douglas is getting away !
skinner !
i have seven other principals ,
and i &apos;ve never yelled their names ,
not even once .
you know what these kids lack ?
well , certainly not a caring superintendent .
well , i , uh ...
respect . that &apos;s what these kids lack .
so we will hold a contest
to make them tell us who they respect
who their heroes are .
a contest ? but , sir , we don &apos;t have
any money to pay for prizes .
we had to rent out our multipurpose room
to a japanese @-@ american social club .
tanpatsu !
the answer is simple , seymour , get a corporate sponsor .
but don &apos;t worry , you won &apos;t have to compromise yourself .
so , from now on , our cafeteria will only serve
由山明治的潜艇三明治赞助
delicious stuffwich &apos;s heroes ,
hoagies and torpedoes .
what about po &apos; boys ?
sorry , nelson . poor boys such as yourself will go hungry .
now please welcome the star of stuffwich &apos;s ads--
who lost 400 pounds eating only stuffwich subs--
ezra !
tell us your hero ,
and you could win a stuffwich college scholarship .
then you can be a hero like me .
what makes you a hero ?
i don &apos;t eat as much as i did !
明天 趣味条幅比赛
反英雄主义者退散
so the chained @-@ up dude
cuts off his own foot to save his family from jigsaw !
my hero is my mom &apos;s boyfriend
who took me to that movie when i was three .
i call him uncle rob because ...
he robbed us !
madame curie , we just might have this one in the bag .
拉尔夫
my hero--
or should i say heroine--
dazzled the early 20th century
with her scientific discoveries ...
okay , calm down .
maybe he &apos;s talking about margaret mead .
... in the field of radioactivity !
i give you
madame marie sklodowska @-@ curie !
no !
no , no , no , no !
martin took my topic .
what do i do ?
oh , just make a speech about dad .
everyone does that .
everyone does that with good dads .
but with our dad , it &apos;s like climbing mount everest .
you either plant your flag at the top of the world
or get frozen in agony forever .
either way , hell of a show .
用户名 马丁王子
people , please ! martin has left the building .
he had an orthodontist appointment .
okay , dad &apos;s my hero .
why is he my hero ?
* we can be heroes *
* just for one day *
* we can be heroes ... *
marge , it happened again !
lisa ? lisa simpson ?
you have ten seconds to get to the podium .
i &apos;m allowed to eat these !
our final contestant is lisa simpson ,
who was last seen leaving in tears .
near tears .
but not in them ?
no .
my hero isn &apos;t famous ...
loser .
isn &apos;t rich ...
pathetic .
and isn &apos;t in any history books .
he makes me sick .
he &apos;s my dad .
what ? !
he worked two jobs
to get me a pony ,
he started me playing the saxophone you all love .
and anyone can put a band @-@ aid on ,
but my dad knows how to take it off so it doesn &apos;t hurt .
well , ah .
oh .
the trick is : wait several weeks .
and when my dad was a soccer referee ,
he had the guts to red card me ,
his only talking daughter ,
because he knew i was diving .
in the history of soccer ,
he is the only parent to ever take sides against his own kid ,
and he was right .
he made me a better person , because that &apos;s what heroes do .
that &apos;s what heroes do .
i &apos;m so glad i was forced to come .
people , people ... we have a tie !
yes , which means that nobody wins .
the money goes back in the school general fund .
but we will put both speeches online .
behind a paywall .
now , please fold up your chairs and stack them .
* cause i &apos;m a grade school hero *
* lisa never lies *
* i &apos;m a grade school hero *
* and heroes never die *
* just one guitar *
* slung way down low *
* yeah , one guitar *
* where did my lawnmower go *
well , look who &apos;s back .
hmm .
hey , dad .
lisa , your speech was one of the nicest things
anyone &apos;s ever done for me .
when did you come up with the idea ?
you must &apos;ve worked on it for days .
oh , dad , you don &apos;t want the details .
no one wants to see the sausage being made .
there &apos;s sausage being made ? ! where ? !
homie , there &apos;s someone here to see you .
coming !
i haven &apos;t forgotten about the sausage .
mr. simpson , i am the executive vice president
of the world football federation .
what you americans call &quot; soccer . &quot;
d &apos;oh !
i &apos;m sure you are familiar with the world cup ,
the quadrennial drama unmatched on the planet !
oh , yeah . that &apos;s the thing the guys at the dry cleaners
get so excited about every four years .
i &apos;m afraid there has been an epidemic of referees
being bribed to throw games .
足球丑闻
from the premier leagues to the playgrounds ,
all has been tainted .
we need a symbol of integrity like yourself .
of course i am , but how do you know ?
oh , your daughter &apos;s speech went viral .
no , no , i mean it spread like wildfire .
much better .
mr. simpson , please help us .
the rot is everywhere .
in fact , i see that i myself
am about to be arrested for corruption .
you will have to take it from here , peter .
yes , i will take good care of your wife .
wait , what @-@ what does that mean ?
mr. simpson , i am the new executive
vice president of the wff .
we need outsiders like you to come to the world cup ,
as our guest , and ref our games properly .
well , no one has ever questioned my professionalism .
except at my profession .
what do you think , sweetie ?
dad , they &apos;re offering us an all @-@ expenses @-@ paid trip
to the greatest sporting event on earth !
the 2008 super bowl ?
oh , i wish .
eli manning &apos;s pass to david tyree .
but about the world cup , i need your answer now .
oh , sure , why not ?
&quot; congratulations on your purchase
of a footmaster @-@ brand soccer ball . &quot;
thanks , book !
look , you got us a free trip .
just slack off and cash your check like you always do .
i believe the sweet little girl in 21 @-@ d
would disagree with you .
what the ... ? !
i switched with her , dad .
my tv didn &apos;t work !
now i can watch my premium hbo !
well , look at you , using approved electronic devices .
to try to avoid any misunderstandings in brazil
like we had the last time , i &apos;m learning the language .
巴西葡萄牙语
ola .
ola !
eu amo o brasil .
eu amo o brasil !
o que e um pais encantador .
will you please turn that off ?
it &apos;s annoying the hell out of the flight crew .
i was just trying to learn the ...
everyone thinks they can learn our language on the plane .
do you know how disrespectful that is ?
all right , just for that attitude , turbulence .
live from sao paulo ,
we bring you the world cup round robin
group f opening @-@ round match !
today &apos;s game is between our host country ,
football powerhouse brazil ...
... and luxemburg , whose entire nation has turned up .
got to hurry .
i &apos;ve got 998 square miles to rob !
the mighty brazilian squad features the greatest master
of the fake injury soccer has ever known : el divo !
now let &apos;s play human foosball !
and with brazil
maintaining an insurmountable one @-@ goal lead ,
with 28 minutes to play , let &apos;s take a look at the refs .
it says here , &quot; homer simpson was recruited for his honesty
and utter disinterest . &quot;
how did he get those shorts on over that arse ?
rumor has it , they employed a team of pullers .
brazil wins it !
and a fairly @-@ called match it was .
in choosing homer simpson ,
the world cup has met its goal ... !
andres cantor ,
you know that is incorrect usage .
i have no control ... !
this job has taken its toll ... !
eu gostaria de ...
hang on , hang on .
... placa de ...
hang on , hang on .
here you go , honey .
how &apos;d you eat the meat without the vegetables ?
well , the stomach wants what it wants .
oh , i need some air .
ah , brazil .
i couldn &apos;t stay afraid of you forever .
the only thing that keeps me from living here
is that fish that swims up your pee stream .
钻入身体造成剧痛
that is a deal breaker .
homer simpson !
i would like to congratulate you
on your fine officiating today .
thanks .
i still can &apos;t believe the yellow and red cards
don &apos;t stand for mustard and ketchup .
your disbelief will fade with time .
but now , i would like to know
if you are as incorruptible as they say .
oh , that is where i left my cell phone .
well ?
you don &apos;t know the new me
of the last few days at all !
we will get to him .
we have our ways .
well , what other ways besides guns and money ?
we have two ways .
two very good ways .
red card !
let me give that back to you .
get out of here !
and as homer officiates ,
looks like we &apos;ve got a little action on the bribe cam .
man ,
krusty should get some of these letters .
while you were out ,
the gamblers sent up gold @-@ frosted donuts ,
a chocolate bowling ball and a fresh pork sandwich .
oh . how fresh ?
where &apos;s your mother ?
went to practice her portuguese .
selcionar conto ...
ooh , ooh , &quot; select account . &quot;
uh , perhaps you could select the english option ?
i did not pay $ 7.99 for an app
so i could use the english option .
you americans , you really throw your $ 7.99s around .
you know , you &apos;re pretty rude .
stupid lady .
give the donuts to the hotel staff .
release the pig and the bowling ball into the wild .
dad , is it hard for you to turn these bribes down ?
yes .
but knowing that lisa chose me as her hero ,
without ever considering any other hero ,
keeps me strong .
why so quiet ?
i &apos;m just examining what kind of person i am
and whether i should destroy your happiness forever .
eh , why not ?
i &apos;m listening .
and it better be devastating .
you weren &apos;t lisa &apos;s hero .
she just swapped you in at the last minute
because someone else did her real hero .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s shattering .
and now i &apos;m a man in pain in the naughtiest city
since san francisco turned all nerdy .
where are you going ?
to drink until there &apos;s no pain left in my soul .
but first i &apos;m gonna eat off someone else &apos;s room service tray
that was left in the hall .
now that &apos;s a broken man .
what the hell are you doing ?
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m an american .
oh . oh . okay .
啤酒和红酒
so , the rumors are true .
we knew you &apos;d find out
your daughter &apos;s original speech topic was marie curie .
and now we need you to fix the greatest game of all
the world cup final .
fine .
marge is always complaining i never fix things .
give me another .
all right .
but we &apos;ve run out of sugarcane .
i carry my own .
all right , homer .
to begin your descent into hell ,
let us enjoy this pirated copy
of man of steel .
but beware : superman was never less fun .
here it is , the world cup final !
决赛
yay !
will it be a german blitzkrieg
or a brazilian waxing ?
nazis !
nazi harborers !
guys , you &apos;re both right .
all right , just so there are no misunderstandings ,
you make sure brazil wins ,
and we give you one million dollars .
if i bet it , i could double it .
but on who ?
you know that brazil is going to win .
oh , thanks for telling me !
i was gonna tape it .
remember , i &apos;ll be watching .
wave a brazilian flag so you stand out in the crowd .
don &apos;t do it , dad . don &apos;t cheat .
you &apos;re a funny one to tell me about deception .
i &apos;m sorry you weren &apos;t my first choice .
in fact ...
i had my doubts about using you at all .
well , if we &apos;re gonna be brutally honest ,
that drawing you made of me when you were three
was far from a perfect likeness .
you put it on the fridge !
it was pity @-@ fridged !
all right , you &apos;re hurt .
i understand .
but when i made you my hero ,
you lived up to it and more .
you became the hero i thought you could be , dad .
oh , come here .
everything &apos;s right with the world .
except that you &apos;re about to double @-@ cross some gangsters .
that &apos;s all right , brain .
if i die ,
i &apos;ll be doing the thing i love the most :
trying not to get killed .
this match is tighter
than two dogs on a summer morn .
there &apos;s no score at all .
even the slightest pebble could start a landslide .
and el divo goes down !
in the box !
will homer award a penalty kick to brazil ?
do it . do it !
call the penalty !
no penalty !
he dove , dad !
no penalty !
i repeat , no penalty !
no penalty .
the game , plus two hours of funeral time ,
is about to conclude .
and with germany the victor , two @-@ nil ,
in an unprecedented display of rectitude
and stubbornness by one homer simpson .
i &apos;ve never seen the brazilians so depressed .
you broke a deal with us .
and we have lost a fortune !
well , at least i &apos;ll die the american way .
in a foreign country wearing short pants .
wait , wait , wait , wait !
i want to say something !
you have one minute .
wait !
let it get to the 12 .
n ... now .
how &apos;s she doing that ?
i don &apos;t know , but she &apos;s my new hero .
yeah , i was a little surprised i wasn &apos;t considered before .
ah , your fluency is impressive .
you can help my son learn hebrew
for his bar mitzvah .
but i &apos;m still killing your husband .
first , mazel tov .
second , don &apos;t !
please , please !
i &apos;m a mother .
surely you have a mother , too .
i do have a mother .
oh , she &apos;s right there .
i &apos;m sorry , my son .
we owe a debt to the simpsons
that can never be repaid .
all that she did was switch seats on a plane .
on a 15 @-@ hour flight !
you are free to go .
no penalty .
fine .
wow , the amazon is just like i pictured it
after seeing all those pictures online .
i &apos;ve never seen anything so beautiful .
the best thing is
i can get locally- sourced monkey meat .
okay , teeny .
take care of part two .
