fresh warm cupcakes !
enjoy this winter wonderland with some hot , hot cocoa !
why are we open and selling to no one
when we should be closed and taking a floor nap ?
yes , max , it &apos;s a blizzard right now ,
but in an hour , it could be 65 !
that &apos;s the beauty of global warming .
you , stop !
i &apos;ll give you a peppermint stick !
that is a straw with red stripes .
well , what sounds better , max ,
a peppermint stick or ...
&quot; a straw with red stripes &quot; ?
first of all , great impression of me .
and second , no one in their right mind
is stopping for cupcakes right now .
oh , hi , girls !
guess who wants a cupcake .
it &apos;s me .
here you go , sophie .
see , max , we have a customer .
and just so you know , i &apos;m not gonna pay .
i am so glad you stay open
even with all this snow everywhere .
you know , good for you .
you two are really committed to this little cupcake window ,
even when it &apos;s stupid .
that &apos;s it , we &apos;re closing .
these streets need to be plowed
more than that poor married jonas brother .
no , wait . listen !
it &apos;s the snowplow .
now , people will be able to get to us .
i told you , it is gonna be one of those
magical new york city nights .
do it again !
why are we here ?
it &apos;s still snowing , and we have no customers .
i had to put money in the cash register
just to steal it .
we can &apos;t just leave . han &apos;s not here .
maybe the trains aren &apos;t running ,
or han got knocked out by a snowflake .
well , you know the diner rule , the one i just made up .
if he &apos;s 30 minutes late ,
we grab whatever we can fit in our pockets and leave .
of course , if he &apos;s 31 minutes late
and there &apos;s no one here , we all get fired .
but i say we roll the dice .
well , whatever happened ,
we can &apos;t run the diner if han &apos;s not here .
that &apos;s right , who &apos;s gonna walk around here
guessing what a vagina looks like ?
uh , me ?
pick up .
i like this cold weather .
i get to wear my chin @-@ cheetah hat .
chin @-@ cheetah ? that &apos;s not even a real animal .
yes , it is . this was the last one .
who &apos;s that food for ? we don &apos;t have any customers .
it &apos;s for me and deke .
we &apos;re studying pastry school stuff in the cupcake shop .
we &apos;re also putting rocks in snowballs and throwing them
at hipsters wearing those stupid stuffed animal hats .
max , you think school will be open ?
i was hoping it &apos;d be closed ,
so i &apos;d have at least have one day
where i wouldn &apos;t have to deal with the drama
between me and chef nicolas .
oh , is that the married man you kissed ?
who told you ?
you ! like a hundred times .
let &apos;s play a snow day game .
like what , guess the code to the safe in han &apos;s office ?
i know the first two numbers are eight and nine .
how about-- if you could have sex
with anyone here , who would it be ?
&quot; could have &quot; or &quot; forced to have &quot; ?
oleg , you go first .
i pick caroline .
oh , thank you . that &apos;s gross .
no , caroline got mauled by a bear in the snow .
i did ?
no , it was me in a bear costume .
she never saw me coming .
so my only two choices are you or earl ?
no , earl passed away in his sleep .
of course , you &apos;ll feel terrible
when that happens in a couple of weeks .
now , if you &apos;d excuse me , i &apos;m going to go home
and roll me a fatty .
her name is denise .
okay , so i pick you .
me ?
you pick me out of all these two people ?
luis , are you blushing ?
no ! i &apos;m wearing blush .
don &apos;t worry , everyone !
i survived !
still don &apos;t know where han is ,
but the new bond villain just arrived .
now there &apos;s an even bigger octopussy in town .
i &apos;m very sorry i &apos;m late .
i got stuck in a snow bank ,
and i had to pee myself out .
where &apos;s max ? and i know she &apos;s not trapped in the storm ,
&apos;cause she &apos;s the one who taught me
how to pee my way out .
max , what is the french name for this pastry
that looks like a bunch of glazed balls ?
a sha @-@ sha @-@ sha ?
no .
a doh @-@ doh @-@ doh @-@ doh @-@ doh ?
oh , so close . it &apos;s a &quot; pata @-@ chow . &quot;
french and chemistry for pastry school ?
i thought class was gonna be like ,
&quot; which is better , cake or bread ?
they &apos;re both great , duh .
here &apos;s your degree . &quot;
i have terrible news .
han &apos;s not dead , and he wants us to do side work .
do you mind ?
harry pothead and i are trying to study .
oh , max , i know how we &apos;ll pass .
we can ask that girl next to us in class for help .
she speaks french .
you know , the one with the bubble butt , judy ?
oh , yeah ! judy with the booty .
you don &apos;t know her that well .
please , call her &quot; judith with the boodith . &quot;
max , can i interrupt this episode of &quot; ass chat &quot;
and talk to you outside for a second ?
sure .
hey , max .
her butt &apos;s so big , she walks into the room doggie @-@ style .
like i said to my uncle when he came into my bedroom
in the middle of the night , &quot; this better be good . &quot;
does it bother you when deke talks
about other girls with you like you &apos;re a guy ?
not as much as it bothers me
when you talk to me like i &apos;m a girl .
look , deke and i are just bros .
i don &apos;t want to sleep with him .
not that there &apos;s anything wrong with
two bros sleeping together .
i &apos;m not bromophobic .
it &apos;s just not what this is .
so you &apos;re sure there &apos;s nothing sexual
going on between you and him ?
yes , i &apos;m sure .
no !
watch , i &apos;m gonna take a snow swim .
not that cold .
you &apos;re right , nothing sexual there
unless you like adult men in underoos .
well , there &apos;s nicolas . i was not prepared for this .
really ? &apos; cause we spent the entire subway ride
preparing you for this .
okay , look , should i brace myself
for weirdness between you two ?
and by that , i mean should i hit this ?
no , i &apos;m cool . cool as a cucumber .
ll cool j. never been cooler .
ugh ! why didn &apos;t i drink before you said that ?
oh , yeah . i am gonna ice him out .
well , maybe lose a couple of those cubes ,
because he is your boss ,
and the only reason i can afford to go here is
&apos;cause you work in the office .
don &apos;t worry , he &apos;ll never know .
pretend you &apos;re nicolas .
hello , caroline .
i am a man , but i am pretty like a lady .
good morning , how are you ?
ooh , that was good .
&apos;sup , max ?
look who i got to ride up with .
hey , max .
hey , jude . you ever heard that one before ?
yeah . is that , like , a thing ?
thanks for the ride up , deke .
caroline .
i thought we were gonna have to take the freight elevator .
really ? i assumed you guys would take the ass @-@ calator .
oh , hello , caroline .
good morning , how are you ?
very well , thank you .
can &apos;t you see i &apos;m mad at you ?
then why are you smiling ?
this is my fake face .
then what does your real face look like ?
how dare you kiss me when you &apos;re married ?
i prefer the fake one .
bonjour , class .
bonjour , chef nicolas .
today , we will be concentrating on the chemistry of baking
for tomorrow &apos;s test .
i don &apos;t know about the damn test ,
but i would ace a pop quiz on that ass .
oh , sorry .
i &apos;ll get that .
let judy pick it up .
it &apos;s a chance to see it in motion .
you think she got that thing at a kim kardashian backyard sale ?
when you add water to the flour to hydrate the two proteins ,
glutenin and gliadin ,
those two proteins are drawn to each other ,
and they bond .
like i like to say , they &apos;re hot for each other .
max , look , they were drawn to each other ,
they bonded ,
and now , we &apos;ve got our own big butt .
dat ass , though !
more like dat ass dough .
you need to wet the dough with water
to keep it moist and supple .
wet your bread , everyone ,
wet your bread .
mine &apos;s pretty wet . how &apos;s yours ?
mine would be , but it &apos;s on antidepressants .
work with your partner , help each other out .
here , let me help , max .
yeah , mine &apos;s not as smooth as yours .
mm , keep kneading it . you need more water .
it &apos;s better , right ?
yeah , i think wetting it helped .
caroline , something is really wrong with me .
don &apos;t freak out . i &apos;m here for you .
unless it &apos;s something i can catch .
something weird happened .
i think i might have feelings for deke .
oh , god , no !
i mean , that is interesting . let &apos;s talk about that .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
we &apos;re bros , and i don &apos;t want to ruin the friendship ,
which is really unlike me .
i always ruin friendships .
i &apos;ve been trying to ruin ours since you moved in .
well , what changed with deke ?
it was so weird-- he was wetting my bread ,
and then my bread was wet , if you know what i &apos;m saying .
okay , thank you . i &apos;m finally off bread .
look , i understand .
you can &apos;t always help who you &apos;re attracted to .
it &apos;s like with me and nicolas--
this is not the same as you and frenchie .
i wasn &apos;t attracted to deke before today .
the first time you met nicolas ,
your vagina fell on the floor and tried to crawl up his leg .
yes , but i scooped it up and snapped it back on
because i was not born to have sex with a married man .
if i was , i would have flirted with matt lauer
when he came over for the christmas tree lighting at my house .
matt lauer-- that guy &apos;s got game .
no hair , but game .
hey , everybody , good news !
oh , i passed that kidney stone .
yeah , i think the skiing loosened it .
oh , i felt like i was birthing a baby through my eye hole .
did you save the stone ?
&apos;cause only three more , and you can make me that necklace .
max , don &apos;t change the subject .
what are you gonna do about deke ?
oh , wait , i love giving advice .
i had my own advice column in poland .
it was called &quot; don &apos;t do that ! &quot;
sophie , have you ever had sex with a friend ?
oh , no . are you two gonna do it ?
no , that is not what--
oh , don &apos;t do that !
no , it will ruin your relationship
and my opinion of max .
what about your opinion of me ?
eh , it &apos;s already pretty low .
what am i gonna do about deke ?
he &apos;s coming over to study tonight .
oh , god , i sound like such a girl from the &apos; 50s .
gonna go cry into my princess phone .
you should tell deke how you feel ,
and tell him tonight ,
because i think that judy girl likes him ,
and i think he might like her too .
why do you say that ? i literally don &apos;t care at all ,
but i just want to know , why would you say that ?
max , he likes big butts , and he cannot lie .
&quot; at what temperature does sugar crystallize ?
fahrenheit and celsius . &quot; go , max .
max .
why are you looking at me like that ?
this doesn &apos;t make any sense !
well , your book is upside down .
hey , hearing a lot of chitchat in here .
just wanted to make sure you two are studying .
stop studying . kiss him .
all right , well , i better be going .
just pretend i &apos;m not here .
i always do .
hey , um , this is weird , but before we study ,
i kind of have something to tell you .
weird , &apos; cause i kinda have something to tell you .
that is weird . maybe it &apos;s the same thing .
someone wants to have sex with me .
how did you know that ?
&apos;cause judy with the booty just texted me ,
&quot; would you like to study tonight
and then have sex with me ? &quot;
i think you &apos;ve interpreted that correctly .
wow , she &apos;s direct and , i might add , slutty .
i know , she &apos;s got balls to go with that butt .
so what were you gonna tell me ?
oh , i was going to tell you what you just told me ,
that judy with the booty wants to have sex with you .
glad she got up the guts to tell you .
so go for it .
wait , you want me to go for it ?
yeah , totally , go for it .
she seems kind of clean . go get it .
but we &apos;re supposed to study .
i wouldn &apos;t want to bail on you just to go hit that .
hey , if you don &apos;t , i will .
you &apos;re really gonna pass that ass up ?
now get going , &apos; cause i have to memorize
what temperature cho @-@ cho @-@ cho turns into chan @-@ chan @-@ chan .
so you &apos;re telling me to go ?
i &apos;m saying , &quot; ta @-@ ta @-@ ta . &quot;
go get her bread wet . make it rise , bro .
okay , then , bro .
i guess i will go , but with that butt ,
if i come back a crack addict , it &apos;s your fault .
where &apos;s he going ? is this a condom run ?
is he going on a condom run ?
&apos;cause if he is , can you text him to pick up a diet coke ?
can , not a bottle . you know the deal .
he &apos;s going to have sex with judy .
you were right , he &apos;s into her .
i &apos;m so glad i didn &apos;t say anything .
that would have felt terrible .
how do you feel now ?
terrible .
but at least i didn &apos;t embarrass myself .
i was this close to showing him my gnomes .
wow , you must really like him
if you were willing to let him know
that you &apos;re an insane person .
well , i &apos;m about to be more screwed than judy ,
because i didn &apos;t study at all .
i know french . i can help you .
you can help me with the keys you have to nicolas &apos; office .
we are breaking in and stealing the test !
why are you covering his ears ? he knows you steal .
you took him from someone &apos;s yard .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re sneaking into his office
to steal your test .
this is cheating .
oh , don &apos;t worry , i hear my teacher &apos;s kind of into cheating .
can &apos;t argue with that .
max , please hurry . find the test ,
and let &apos;s get out of here because we shouldn &apos;t be in here
and it smells like him and i like it .
okay , one of these papers has to be it .
oh , no , everything &apos;s written in secret code !
max , that &apos;s french .
how is it possible he &apos;s even better @-@ looking in photos
than in real life ?
max , hurry up . i can &apos;t be around his stuff .
my vagina &apos;s trying to get out of my pants again .
well , get her out here !
maybe she can help me look for the test ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re useless .
oh , no , it &apos;s nicolas .
i can smell him in the hall , and i like it .
max , let &apos;s get out of here .
okay , well , you have to stay and distract him ,
so i can sneak out .
just pretend you &apos;re not mad and you came in to see him .
i can &apos;t just turn it on like that .
what am i , an actress at a cocktail party ?
you have to , it &apos;s the only logical explanation
you have for being in here .
caroline .
i &apos;ve missed you . i &apos;m in your office .
that &apos;s the only logical explanation i have for being in here .
oh , sorry . did i hurt you ?
oh , no , i &apos;m sitting on something .
oh , sorry . oh , those are the exams for today .
oh , well , let me just give us some room
while i push these exams on the floor .
now , kiss me again , but this time , lay on top of me ,
so your legs are out of the way . now , go !
wait . wait , wait , wait .
you know this can &apos;t happen . you &apos;re married .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have to go snap something back on .
well , here are the test answers ,
but i don &apos;t know what the questions are
because i only got half the test ,
and i &apos;m only half sure those are the answers .
whoa , dude , how did you get this ?
i turned caroline into a whore .
can you figure out any of this ?
i don &apos;t have any idea what these questions could be .
ugh ! i didn &apos;t study either .
judy and i got to talking , and it got pretty involved .
well , now we &apos;re screwed .
i mean , you already got screwed .
congrats . proud of you , bro .
max , we &apos;re gonna flunk this test .
better go to the men &apos;s room
and write all the answers on my penis .
don &apos;t worry , they &apos;ll fit .
i hope you &apos;re happy ,
i &apos;ve now kissed a married man twice .
oh , and here , i grabbed this from nicolas &apos; office .
that &apos;s not the test . it &apos;s a phone bill .
i know , i wanted you to see he doesn &apos;t call his wife much .
fire ! everyone get out !
move your big ass ! we &apos;re gonna burn ! scoot .
oh , my god , max !
i hope nicolas is okay !
don &apos;t worry about me , i &apos;m right behind you !
caroline , i want you to be safe . come with me .
you &apos;re married . i &apos;ll just stay here and burn .
caroline , don &apos;t be crazy .
this is all your fault .
don &apos;t worry about me , i &apos;m right behind you !
max , wait .
it &apos;s just a false alarm . i pulled it .
so classy .
you weren &apos;t gonna pass that test ,
and i need you in that class with me .
you did this for me ?
yeah , and for me too , i wasn &apos;t gonna pass either .
but , look , when you were talking about me and judy just now ,
you seemed kind of weird , and--
oh , hey , i just had a weird moment yesterday
when you were getting my dough wet
and i kinda got turned on ,
sort of thought i liked you . yeah , gross , right ?
oh , right , yeah . totally gross .
anyway , dude , we &apos;re just bros .
okay , bro , but just so you know ,
nothing happened between me and judy last night .
that &apos;s lame-- if you like a girl ,
you should just grab her and kiss her .
okay .
was that weird ?
yeah . and i liked it .
max , come on !
sorry to interrupt ,
but we &apos;re supposed to evacuate the building .
there &apos;s no fire . deke pulled the alarm .
i wanted to kiss her .
yeah . turns out he &apos;s into dudes .
