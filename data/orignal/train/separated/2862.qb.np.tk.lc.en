pick a card.okay
all right . now , memorize it .
you got it ?
oh , yes .
is that your card ?
yes .
hey , guys . -hi there !
guess what . ben is gonna be in a tv commercial .
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s not for sure , but ...
... we met this guy in the park who thought ben was cute .
you know , which he is .
he gave us his card ... and told us to bring him for this commercial he &apos;s auditioning .
this guy &apos;s the biggest commercial casting director in town !
ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition ?
i mean , way to go , ben !
i &apos;ve been in that park a million times and no one &apos;s offered me an audition .
it &apos;s crazy . we were pushing ben on the swings
i &apos;m always on the swings !
what am i doing wrong ?
that .
the one where rachel smokes
gotta go . wish me luck . -good luck .
since you work at ralph lauren , can you get me some shirts ?
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d feel comfortable stealing on my very first day .
unwilling to steal from work .
interesting .
if anybody gets free stuff , it &apos;s me .
okay , guys , way to wish me luck .
go get &apos; em !
let &apos;s discuss rachel &apos;s birthday .
i say we throw a surprise party this weekend .
but her birthday &apos;s not for another month .
if we throw her party on her birthday , it &apos;s not a surprise .
great !
we can have a dinner party and just invite her close friends .
ross !
we &apos;re having a surprise party for rachel .
okay
done .
great . wanna do it together ? i &apos;d love to do it together !
they &apos;re gonna do it together .
that &apos;s my girlfriend .
so i gotta shut it down now ?
i gotta go .
i &apos;m picking up ben ... and then we &apos;re off to the big audition .
it &apos;s gonna be weird seeing some actor pretending to be ben &apos;s dad .
yes
weirder than seeing his two moms make out ?
dad ? there &apos;s a dad in the commercial ?
yeah . the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it .
maybe i &apos;ll go with you and audition as the dad .
who better to play ben &apos;s father than his godfather ?
you &apos;re not his godfather .
what ?
are you kidding ?
of course i am .
okay , let &apos;s go , godfather .
all right !
they &apos;re gonna let me audition !
really ? that &apos;s great !
one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play.so i steered clear of her .
and the other one , i know from .... well , you know .
that kid looks familiar . -oh , yeah .
he &apos;s done tons of commercials .
i &apos;ve seen him in sugar smacks , playstation ...
... and that one for the phone company .
he was so good , he convinced me to switch phone companies .
chandler was mad .
he &apos;s not gonna get this one . ben is way cuter than that kid .
i mean , look at him .
that &apos;s great.wouldn &apos;t it be great if i got to play ben &apos;s dad ?
you look nothing like ben .
i look more like him than you do .
i really don &apos;t know you well enough for you to do that .
so it &apos;s down to these two .
nancy , i know you like this one.i think i agree .
rachel , what do you think ?
well , that one is pretty ...
... but i just love this fabric.sorry.
don &apos;t be . part of your job is to give your opinions .
then i take credit for them . i &apos;m kidding !
she is kidding . but don &apos;t ever disagree with her again .
okay , now i &apos;m kidding !
what a fun office .
i don &apos;t know which one . but i do know i need a cigarette .
let &apos;s take a break , go outside and sort this out when we return .
rachel ?
you smoke ?
no.my dad &apos;s a doctor . and he would always tell me horror stories ....
about ghosts and goblins ...
... who totally supported the princess &apos; right to smoke .
and then they came back from smoking and they &apos;d made all of the decisions .
that &apos;s not fair .
i know .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m being punished for not having this disgusting , poisonous habit .
yeah , it is the best .
what if this keeps happening ?
they &apos;ll be smoking , making the decisions ...
... and i &apos;ll be up in my office breathing in my stupid clean air .
and when kim wants to promote one of us ... who do you think she &apos;ll pick ?
... me or smokey smokerson ?
we used to have a smoking area at work .
it was great . there was this big flowerpot with dirt in it.we used to put our cigarettes out in it .
one of the old @-@ timers told me there used to be a little tree in there .
you can go down there and not smoke . say you want some fresh air .
i could do that .
or you could do the easy thing and smoke .
you gotta take long , deep drags .
wow , i still don &apos;t have my lung capacity back yet .
rach , do you wanna go get coffee ?
i would love to .
oh , good .
i &apos;m gonna go too .
oh , good .
oh , i changed my mind .
let &apos;s talk about the party . i have so many ideas .
me too !
oh , look at that .
this is a little sketch of the cake . see ?
some sample menus .
i thought we &apos;d start with a tuscan @-@ style finger food .
and for music , here &apos;s an alphabetized list of all of my cds .
i &apos;ve highlighted the ones that &apos;ll go with the food .
what about the intimate dinner party ?
we &apos;re not doing that .
looks like you took care of everything . thanks a lot , cohost .
wait a minute . there &apos;s plenty of things for you to do .
like what ?
cups .
you &apos;re giving me cups ?
and ice .
cups and ice ? i get to be in charge of cups and ice ?
all right .
fine . i will be in charge of cups and ice .
i can get ice at the restaurant
i got it !
how did the audition go ?
not so good .
wait a minute . are you doing joey &apos;s :
&quot; the audition didn &apos;t go so well ....
yeah , it did &quot; ?
yeah , i am !
yeah , ben got a second audition . -that &apos;s great !
i had to teach ross my bit because i actually didn &apos;t get a callback .
you got a callback too , didn &apos;t you ?
yeah , i did !
what are you doing out here ?
it got kind of lonely up there , so i thought i would come out here ... and get some fresh air .
we &apos;re discussing the fall collection.oh , great .
anyway , we really
sorry . we &apos;re smoking all over you .
that &apos;s okay .
we &apos;ll move . you stay there .
i sent the designs to ralph . he was excited about it .
that &apos;s great ! you are the best !
excuse me . can i bum one of those ?
actually , this one &apos;s ....
what &apos;s so funny over here ?
i thought you didn &apos;t smoke .
you know , i thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes .
you know what i mean ? doobies ?
actually , i thought to myself , &quot; those guys are crazy ! &quot;
but no , i smoke the regular ones all the time .
we get high .
me too .
i &apos;m kidding .
me too .
oh , god ! this is so nerve @-@ racking . how do you do this ?
fortunately , i don &apos;t get many callbacks , so ....
is it a good sign that they asked us to wait ?
who knows ?
we have narrowed it down to raymond , ben , kyle ...
... and joey . the rest of you , thank you .
yes ! i knew it !
bye @-@ bye .
so long .
later .
i &apos;m not married to him anymore . he &apos;s my ex @-@ husband . i &apos;m totally gay !
this is great ! i might get to play ben &apos;s dad .
actually , that can &apos;t happen .
because you have such different looks ...
... we &apos;re putting you with raymond and kyle with ben .
so it &apos;ll either be you two or you two .
man , this is gonna be kind of weird .
yeah , it is .
yeah . it &apos;s gonna be weird .
no . we &apos;re like best friends . that &apos;s why it &apos;s weird .
i thought we were just talking .
if ben gets this commercial , do you think you can get me some free soup ?
chandler , a can of soup is like 60 cents .
yeah , okay , but i have been supporting a 29 @-@ year @-@ old ltalian for five years .
is it okay if i leave this here till rachel &apos;s birthday party ?
sure . what &apos;s in them ?
cups .
good , because we got rachel 800 gallons of water .
that &apos;s a lot of cups .
i &apos;m in charge of cups and ice .
and monica &apos;s gonna rue the day she put me in charge of cups and ice .
you know , i rued the day once . didn &apos;t get a whole lot else done .
okay , time to bring up the rest of the cups .
joey phoebe
ross , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here.i want to talk to you .
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;ve been thinking about this commercial thing .
me against ben.the two of us competing .
that can &apos;t lead to anything good .
i think i &apos;m just gonna step aside . i &apos;ll tell them that i won &apos;t audition .
joey , that &apos;s great . thanks , man .
that &apos;s it ?
you &apos;re gonna let me do this ? it &apos;s my career we &apos;re talking about !
but you just ... i just said that so you wouldn &apos;t let ben do it .
if anyone should step aside , it should be ben .
what ?
chandler , tell him !
well , let me get the door first .
hi , no one !
why should ben step aside ?
it was his audition in the first place .
you tagged along.you &apos;re like the tagalong dad !
at least i care about his feelings .
what ?
you know how hard it &apos;ll be on him when he doesn &apos;t get it ?
and why wouldn &apos;t he get it ?
come on ! have you seen what my kid can do ?
he dials phones , he eats tortilla chips .
he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger !
are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid ?
you just give him a spoon , baby .
oh , yeah ? i guess we &apos;ll see !
this commercial belongs to me and mitch !
your kid &apos;s name is raymond !
yeah ? so is yours !
how did work go ?
lt was great.i went down there like you said .
and we talked business.and kim took my opinions .
you stink !
thanks .
no , i &apos;m serious .
that &apos;s because i went down there and they were smoking .
this is actually the smell of success .
but there &apos;s something different . oh , my god ! you smoked !
i did not .
yes , you did . you look happy and sick . you smoked !
all right , fine ! but i had to . i had to do it for my career .
i wish i had to smoke for my career .
but it &apos;s so gross !
it &apos;s not that bad , you know ?
yeah , my tongue feels a little fuzzy and my fingers sort of smell .
i actually feel like i could throw up .
can you hear yourself ?
i know . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m not myself . i smoked like half a pack.i feel a little shaky and a little weird .
but you gotta push past this , okay ? because it &apos;s about to get so good .
chandler
you smell so smoky , i gotta get up .
i &apos;m not kidding .
i think you smell great .
so we &apos;re decided . no on plaid , yes on pink .
absolutely .
i &apos;m so onboard .
didn &apos;t you just light that ?
yeah.but you know what ? i &apos;m just really , really trying to cut back , you know .
good luck , rach .
i &apos;ve been thinking about quitting .
every sunday night , i tell myself i &apos;m quitting .
every monday morning , it &apos;s like :
tell me about it .
we &apos;ll just quit . let &apos;s all quit !
it sounds appealing .
i never could do it .
but you could . absolutely .
we can help each other .
we could get those patches.we could be like the patch sisters .
you know , we really should quit . okay , let &apos;s quit !
great ! give me those cigs . come on ! give it ! out . done . quit .
my late husband gave me that lighter .
i &apos;m not kidding .
okay , then .
mmm ... soup .
mmm ... soup .
mmm ... soup
joey , ross is gonna be here any second
would you mind watching ben for me while i use the ladies &apos; room ?
no problem .
thanks .
hi ben
so you want to be an actor ?
i gotta tell you , it &apos;s no picnic .
there &apos;s tons of rejection .
no stability .
i mean , one day , you &apos;re dr. drake ramoray .
the next day , you &apos;re eating ketchup out of the bottle .
it &apos;s a tough life .
i mean , sure , you can get up whenever you want ...
... watch tv all day ...
... meet tons of women in acting class ....
oh , who am i kidding . i can &apos;t talk you out of this . it &apos;s a great life .
joey .
ross .
ben .
i mean , ben . ben .
raymond , joey , you &apos;re up .
so here &apos;s what ....
are you sure that i haven &apos;t seen you somewhere before ?
no , i haven &apos;t been in any plays .
all right , let &apos;s try one .
whenever you guys are ready .
is there a problem ?
well , this is noodle soup . and i &apos;ve been working with tomato .
but that &apos;s okay . no problem .
mmm ... noodle soup .
you know , that &apos;s fine . but the line is , &quot; mmm ... soup . &quot;
what &apos;d i say ?
&quot; mmm ... noodle soup . &quot;
how &apos;s that different ?
yes
all right . let &apos;s try one .
mmm ... noodle soup .
let &apos;s do it again .
mmm ... soup.i mean , noodle soup . i mean , soup !
come on !
you know what ? we need to move on .
no , i could do it one more time.look.
mmm ... noodle soup.damn it !
so i think that if we get these samples into the magazine by monday , we &apos;ll be fine .
sounds good .
so , rach , how you doing ? -i &apos;m great !
no , with the not @-@ smoking thing .
kill me now.let me tell you something ,
i ate 40 mallomars today .
i mean , i have patches all over my body , you know ?
i mean , i haven &apos;t slept in two days .
we quit yesterday .
that &apos;s counting today .
but anyway , so these samples , i think
oh , my god ! i &apos;m so sorry , i forgot . i have to go to the mailroom and mail some proofs .
go ahead . rachel and i will just sit here and keep brainstorming .
also , vogue called . and they were wondering
you know what ? i &apos;m a little hungry . i &apos;m just gonna run down to the vending machines .
all right .
busted !
come on ! what are you doing ? i thought we were the patch sisters .
that didn &apos;t work out .
wait a minute . what about all we &apos;ve talked about ?
you know , the disgusting place , the ugly people .
hey , how you doing ?
we tried to quit . but it was too hard .
if you started smoking again , you could have at least told me .
give me one . what are we talking about ?
don &apos;t you give up .
that &apos;s why we didn &apos;t tell you , and we won &apos;t drag you down .
wait . no , no . drag me down .
forget it . we &apos;re so proud of how well you &apos;re doing .
i won &apos;t let you blow it .
if i catch you , you &apos;re fired .
go on , get out of here . i don &apos;t want you breathing this stuff .
so , okay . you &apos;ll come with me on the paris trip ?
oh , man !
check it out . cup hat ,
cup banner ...
... cup chandelier ,
and the thing that started it all : the cup !
great job with the cups .
why don &apos;t you just go out with her ?
did you notice the ice ? look !
we have it all .
we have crushed , cubed
and dry . watch .
mystical .
no one &apos;s eating my food . they &apos;re eating her snow cones !
there are snow cones ?
snow cones ! yuck
go , go !
thank you .
phoebe
you really did do a nice job .
thank you ... for stating the obvious .
i deserve that .
i just want you to know that ...
if we ever cohost a party together again ... you can do whatever you want .
joey &apos;s got a birthday coming up.-really ?
what do you wanna do ?
okay , i &apos;d like to be in charge of beer .
well , then there &apos;s nothing left for me .
look , look !
surprise !
what ? my birthday is not for another month .
that &apos;s the surprise .
oh , my god , you guys ! this is so great !
it &apos;s so unexpected.i mean , chandler &apos;s birthday is even before mine .
surprise !
this is so great ! look at all these ... cups .
... this is so weird
i was in charge of cups .
oh , okay . not so weird .
chandler , what are you doing ?
nothing .
what &apos;s in your hand ?
money . i &apos;m stealing all the money .
chandler .
but just one , okay ? because nobody knows when my birthday is .
let me make this clear to you , okay ?
it &apos;s either that ...
... or this .
they were menthol .
listen , man . i &apos;m sorry the audition didn &apos;t go well .
yeah , right .
no , really . i am , joey . i feel bad .
look , ross . you don &apos;t have to , okay ?
it &apos;s not your fault i suck .
what kind of an actor can &apos;t even say , &quot; mmm ... noodle soup &quot; ?
you know what ? maybe you didn &apos;t mess up your audition because you suck .
maybe you messed up because you care more about your godson .
what do you mean ?
i think , subconsciously
you lost me .
i think , on some level ,
you sabotaged ... your own audition
... so ben would get the part .
your way sounds a lot better than mine .
it &apos;s not that i &apos;m a bad actor .
no , it &apos;s just that i care so damn much about little ben ...
... that it was more important for me to see him succeed .
there you go . thank you .
thank you .
so did he get it ?
no .
what are you gonna do ?
is rachel green here ? i &apos;m meeting her for lunch .
she doesn &apos;t come down anymore . you &apos;ll find her on 10 .
okay , great .
so we talked about the presentation.he wondered if one person would be enough .
and i said , &quot; yeah , absolutely . &quot;
