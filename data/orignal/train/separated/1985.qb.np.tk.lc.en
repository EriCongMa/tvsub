no , mike , stop .
sorry
smooth .
you would made a nice ballerina .
i &apos;m not gonna apologize for my lithe physique , okay ?
and , by the way , i was on the wrestling team
in high school , so ...
is something funny ?
i &apos;m just trying to imagine you fighting someone .
i would kill you .
you wouldn &apos;t touch me .
why not ?
because you &apos;d be too busy staring at me in tights .
no , i wouldn &apos;t .
you &apos;re doing it right now .
you &apos;re not wearing any tights .
i &apos;m not wearing any underwear .
i &apos;m--you--
okay , so , mrs. williams ,
we &apos;re gonna take you to the deposition
as soon as kenny verdasco &apos;s finished , all right ?
you two draw the short straw ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
you &apos;re in charge of corralling the cancer patients .
it &apos;s not the most glamorous duty in the world .
i supposed you two don &apos;t mind working together .
how long you been dating ?
no , no , i &apos;m sort of seeing someone--
it &apos;s gonna happen sooner or later .
excuse me .
excuse me for a moment .
yes ?
i &apos;m sorry , i think i &apos;m in the wrong place .
are you here for the emerson petroleum deposition ?
no , no , i &apos;m an old friend of harvey specter &apos;s .
this place is huge . i just get turned around .
maybe you can point me in the right direction .
no problem .
you just see those doors right there ?
go through to the elevators ,
then up two floors ,
and then you &apos;re gonna take a right ,
and down the hall , and you &apos;ll see donna .
donna . great , thanks .
travis tanner .
mike ross . good to meet you .
pleasure to meet you , too , mike .
take care .
my wife emily and i ,
we saved every dollar i made in the army ,
and we moved here from apple creek , new york ,
six years ago .
we bought a brownstone ,
and planted a tomato garden .
we had barbecues with the neighbors .
it was--it was a dream come true .
after being diagnosed with lung cancer ,
i couldn &apos;t work anymore .
i mean , there &apos;s times i have difficulty
even going up the stairs to my daughter &apos;s room .
you attended apple creek high school , is that right ?
all four years .
you high school was built in 1985 .
what was there before ?
an oil well ,
owned and operated by emerson petroleum .
now , kenny , why was the high school shut down ?
because 200 people who taught at
or attended apple creek high were diagnosed
with some form of cancer .
i &apos;m so sorry to interrupt .
that &apos;s for you , larry .
trust me , it &apos;s good . use it .
how do you know my name ?
it &apos;s all in there , larry .
hey , are you donna ?
yeah , can i help you ?
yeah , mike ross told me to find you .
we were in the library and one of the plaintiffs fainted ,
hit their head .
oh , my gosh .
okay , i &apos;m on it . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
wrong office .
harvey , i have to admit , great job making kenny verdasco
the face of your class action suit .
i don &apos;t know who kenny verdasco is .
oh , well , you better find out .
how about for starters you introduce yourself
or i &apos;m calling security . donna !
relax , relax . name &apos;s travis tanner .
you &apos;re travis tanner ?
you &apos;ve heard of me .
no .
i &apos;m a senior partner with clyde @-@ macphee .
we &apos;re based in boston .
so are the red sox .
i don &apos;t give a shit about them either .
that &apos;s funny .
you know what &apos;s not funny , is what &apos;s happening
to kenny verdasco .
at this moment , they &apos;re asking him about his parents ,
both heavy smokers . nasty habit .
yes , a pack a day each .
i lived with them till i was 18 .
and then they &apos;ll ask how in the army
he was exposed to nickel , chromium , and hydrocarbons .
i was an infantry soldier .
i didn &apos;t have much choice in the matter .
not to mention the frivolous lawsuit
he filed ten years ago against the shriver grocery chain .
it wasn &apos;t frivolous .
i slipped and shattered my elbow .
if they &apos;re doing such a great job down there ,
what are you doing up here in my office ?
&apos;cause i gave them all that .
and when they walk out that door ,
i &apos;m gonna be the one who fires their asses .
so you coming to me for a pep talk ?
you &apos;re gonna do great , kiddo .
no , you see , emerson petroleum
was gonna lose this case .
so they called me in to fix the situation .
and when i beat pearson hardman ,
i don &apos;t want anyone saying
it was because they didn &apos;t send in their best .
well , i &apos;m sorry to disappoint you ,
but jessica pearson &apos;s handling this case herself .
and if you think that she &apos;s not the best ,
why don &apos;t you take a run at her and find out ?
all right , look , i hear what you &apos;re saying ,
but here &apos;s the thing .
i know that you know who i am .
and i also know that during your senior year
you missed out on playing in the state championship
because of your shoulder .
you can &apos;t pitch with a bad shoulder .
and what do you know ,
they won without you , harvey .
now ask yourself something .
are you gonna let jessica pearson
play the big game for you , hmm ?
what &apos;s so funny ?
i &apos;m just thinking about
how i &apos;m gonna enjoy kicking your ass .
i &apos;ll see you in court .
it was an attack on my history , my family ,
everything i care about .
i told you this was coming .
they &apos;re just trying to rattle you .
yeah , well , they &apos;re doing a hell of a good job .
kenny , you &apos;re our lead plaintiff .
you &apos;ve got to keep your composure .
i don &apos;t care about composure .
i want to make a settlement .
that &apos;s exactly what they want .
kenny , i &apos;d like you to meet harvey specter .
he &apos;s my right hand .
can your right hand please tell me why
we shouldn &apos;t ask for a settlement ?
i &apos;m not against settling one bit .
but if we go to them , we &apos;re weak .
they come to us , we &apos;re strong .
harvey &apos;s right .
they came after you because they &apos;re running scared .
trust me , they &apos;ll come to us soon enough .
okay .
one more thing ,
i &apos;m gonna postpone the rest of the depositions .
don &apos;t tell the rest of the plaintiffs what happened .
what the hell was that ?
i need you to let me take over this case .
the guy that came into my deposition .
he called you out ?
yeah .
he &apos;s good .
yeah .
you think i can &apos;t take him ?
he brought up the state championship .
oh , shoulder .
yeah .
take him .
be careful .
i will .
bringing up state championships ,
that &apos;s just-- that &apos;s wrong .
nothing i wouldn &apos;t have done .
thanks .
i need you to dig into travis tanner .
find out where he &apos;s worked , where he &apos;s gone to school ,
what cases he &apos;s won .
why , you thinking about starting a wikipedia page for him ?
i don &apos;t know anything about how this guy operates .
and before i make a move , i need to know everything
about how this guy operates .
right , for his wikipedia page .
you think the mavericks didn &apos;t watch game film
on lebron before they played the heat ?
you &apos;re harvey specter .
you don &apos;t need to watch game film .
do you know who &apos;s watched more game film than anybody ?
no . who ?
michael jordan .
what ? how do you know that ?
you don &apos;t believe me ? let &apos;s call him .
you have michael jordan &apos;s phone number .
yep .
if i hit this button right here ,
i call michael jordan ?
that &apos;s kinda how a phone works .
speed dial 23 .
i &apos;m doing it .
go for it .
i &apos;m gonna ask him about baseball .
do not ask him about baseball .
wrong--wrong number .
you &apos;re kidding me .
oh , my god .
who are you ?
everybody stop what you &apos;re doing ,
stand up , and follow me in the library .
mike , that goes for you too , up and at &apos; em .
yeah , louis , i &apos;d love to ,
but i have some work to do for--
his majesty can &apos;t wait .
all associates in the library now .
let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s go .
rumor is we &apos;re getting our annual raises early .
people are freaking out .
that &apos;s great , harold .
i &apos;m thinking about getting a tattoo .
you need a raise for that ?
i &apos;m really overpaying for my apartment .
good morning , everyone .
many of you seem to think
this is about getting your raises early .
it isn &apos;t .
suck .
we &apos;ve discovered a breach at the firm .
a confidential witness list was leaked to a rival firm ,
wakefield @-@ cady .
now it &apos;s entirely possible
that this was an honest mistake .
if so , we urge the responsible party
to come forward .
if not , we &apos;ll find out soon enough .
either way ,
we will get to the bottom of this .
louis .
jessica seems to think a mistake &apos;s been made .
i don &apos;t believe so .
i also don &apos;t believe this is a matter of ethics .
it &apos;s a matter of loyalty .
someone in this room has betrayed us all ,
and it makes me sick .
the fact that it went to those holier @-@ than @-@ thou pricks
at wakefield @-@ cady , you know what , that makes me sicker .
now , you all work together ,
in the trenches , shoulder @-@ to @-@ shoulder ,
which means one of you must know who did this .
now if y &apos;all harbor knowledge of the perpetrator
and do not turn him in ,
you &apos;re as bad as the perpetrator himself ,
you along with the perpetrator will be fired .
he &apos;s doing george w. bush .
you &apos;re either with us or against us , folks .
he sounds like bush , but he looks just like cheney .
you got something to tell me , harold ?
no ?
not that dermatological problem
that you were talking about earlier in my office ?
no , not that one ?
no .
to show you how serious i am ,
i have an incentive .
whoever turns this traitor in
receives $ 10,000 .
you &apos;re welcome .
feel free to go back to work .
$ 10,000 , that &apos;s a big tattoo .
yeah , it &apos;d be huge .
why ?
louis , there was a--
i don &apos;t care .
tell me what you learned about travis tanner .
it &apos;s all in there .
travis tanner went to yale ,
undergrad in law , honors in both .
he was a junior tennis champion .
tennis . just like louis .
yeah , he played in college too .
oh , my god .
more importantly ,
he was the youngest senior partner at clyde @-@ macphee .
this guy &apos;s record is off the charts .
really ?
he specializes in breaking class action lawsuits .
harris tobacco , bell pesticide ,
gravtech securities , he broke &apos; em all .
how come i &apos;ve never heard of him ?
evidently , he doesn &apos;t like to take public credit .
stays off the radar , he avoids the press .
i only found this stuff by looking through court records .
now it makes sense .
what ?
why he thinks i know him .
i know those other attorneys .
he thinks they &apos;ve told me about him .
they never did ?
no .
why not ?
because he beat them .
this guy &apos;s kind of a badass .
you want me to get you an autograph ?
no , i &apos;m just respecting our foe .
foe ?
it &apos;s from the art of war .
no ?
no , look , i need to know
how those other cases are different from ours .
those other cases were spread out
geographically , economically , socially .
ours is in a single town , a single school
with a single cluster of plaintiffs .
that &apos;s good .
that tennis @-@ playing douchebag travis tanner &apos;s on the phone .
you know i listen .
travis , what can i do for you ?
yeah , i &apos;m happy to discuss the case ,
on one condition .
you &apos;re gonna meet me at apple creek high school .
see you in an hour .
why do you want to meet there ?
because that &apos;s ground zero .
and i want the emotion of that school under my feet
when i negotiate .
i thought you were against emotions .
i &apos;m against having emotions ,
not against using them .
come on , i thought we were homies .
jimmy , i didn &apos;t leak anything .
you know , i remember you said
you hated louis litt and you were second @-@ guessing
your decision to become a lawyer .
i told you that in confidence over six cosmopolitans .
it doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re not the guy .
harold , really ? you drink cosmopolitans ?
stop doing that unless you &apos;re with girls ,
which you never are . and , jimmy ,
are you kidding me , going after harold ?
what , how do you know he didn &apos;t do it ?
how do we know you didn &apos;t do it ?
maybe you &apos;re the guy .
oh , my god , guys , this is ridiculous .
all right , has it occurred to any of you
that maybe this is all just a big test ?
spoken like a person with something to hide .
louis was talking about loyalty .
maybe this is just some test to see how loyal we are
by not turning on each other .
are you kidding ?
jessica would never play along with something like that .
even if it &apos;s not a test ,
this is a law office , not lord of the flies .
everybody get back to work .
are these the galusska briefs ?
you guys , louis has been hounding us for these .
why hasn &apos;t anyone taken them to him ?
are you serious ?
wow . you &apos;re scared of him .
he &apos;s louis litt , he &apos;s not darth vader .
this is what courage looks like . jimmy , pay attention .
please .
louis , the galusska briefs .
sorry they &apos;re late .
hmm , thank you , mr. mike ross .
sure you &apos;re ready for this ?
i &apos;m here , aren &apos;t i ?
i &apos;ve been looking into you . you &apos;re an elusive man .
yeah , well , when you &apos;re number one ,
you don &apos;t need to broadcast your victories , harvey .
that &apos;s funny . where i come from ,
number one doesn &apos;t usually challenge number two to a fight .
this school was apple creek &apos;s pride .
parents felt safe sending their children here ,
and teachers felt safe teaching here .
you know what apple creek high school is now ?
a bunch of trailers on the outskirts of town .
all because 30 years ago your clients
failed to cap an oil well and gave them all cancer .
you see all these power lines around here ?
they crisscross the entire town .
two miles down that road , paint factory .
you got a microwave tower .
and all this grass that you see ?
it &apos;s been treated with pesticide every week for 20 years .
you say it &apos;s our fault . i say you &apos;re wrong .
that office , mitch rosewall ,
soccer coach , brain cancer .
library , monica dodd , volunteer .
she ran it for years . stomach cancer .
they both died last month ,
and they sure as hell didn &apos;t die from pesticide .
can you prove it ?
if we go to trial ,
it won &apos;t be about proving anything .
it &apos;ll be about monica , mitch , and kenny ,
and you won &apos;t stand a chance .
ah , this is fun , harvey .
i &apos;m just sorry to say that we won &apos;t get to do this in court .
against my advice , emerson wants to settle .
you &apos;re kidding me .
after all this , you want to settle .
no , i don &apos;t , but those are my instructions .
call it a draw .
mike , get over to kenny &apos;s house .
tanner &apos;s gonna try and make him cave .
i came as soon as i got the message .
kenny .
it &apos;s harvey specter .
was travis tanner here ? i was just with him .
he couldn &apos;t have beaten me by much .
sweetie , why don &apos;t you go inside , okay , baby ?
no , it wasn &apos;t him .
it was someone else . he wouldn &apos;t tell me his name .
he said he was with pearson @-@ hardman , so i let him in .
did he mention tanner &apos;s name ?
no , but it was obvious that &apos;s who he worked for .
he said me and the other plaintiffs
were gonna get a settlement offer soon .
what else ?
he said if we don &apos;t take it ,
that they &apos;re gonna go after us .
that they have dirt on everyone .
he mentioned eva williams&apos;
arrest for public intoxication ,
bernie rutherford &apos;s shoplifting arrest
when he was in college .
that &apos;s criminal intimidation .
if they want to go after me , that &apos;s fine .
i can handle it .
but the others , i don &apos;t know if they can .
you have to stay strong , kenny .
you cave , everything falls apart .
one more thing , what did this guy look like ?
i don &apos;t know , he was average height ,
brown hair , brown eyes .
thanks .
so figuring out who this guy is ?
no . we &apos;ll never find him .
how &apos;d you know was going after kenny ?
&apos;cause if i was the type to go out of bounds ,
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;d do .
you &apos;re not ?
no .
so what &apos;s our next move ?
i &apos;m calling in reinforcements .
what do you mean ?
if tanner sent a guy to intimidate kenny ,
he &apos;s got something else up his sleeve ,
and i want to know what it is .
what ?
nothing , you guys are like two sides of the same coin .
what are you saying , he &apos;s another me ?
no one is another me .
i mean , you told donna i was another you .
i never said that .
you said you were looking for another you ,
and then you hired me .
so see how that works ?
logic .
mike , let &apos;s go . in my office now .
oh , damn , mike .
tell me you didn &apos;t leak the documents , man .
are you our benedict arnold ?
benedict arnold , nice reference .
you helping your high school girlfriend
with her homework again ?
okay , not cool , mike .
you know darla &apos;s in community college .
i don &apos;t even know why you laughing , harold .
you don &apos;t have a chick .
she &apos;s of age .
i am so very proud of you , mike .
wow , i really wish you weren &apos;t touching me right now .
you are what loyalty looks like .
you rooted out the person responsible
for leaking the witness list to wakefield @-@ cady .
louis , i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
it was almost cute how you hid the evidence
in the galusska briefs .
like you didn &apos;t want to take the credit .
what ? louis , i didn &apos;t hide anything .
don &apos;t worry , no one &apos;s gonna label you a snitch .
snitch ?
we didn &apos;t even think to check the fax machines .
that was brilliant .
the list was sent from right here in this firm .
this is a copy of a fax submission form sent from three days ago .
this doesn &apos;t implicate anybody .
that &apos;s the confidential employee code .
she must not have known that the machine recorded it .
she ?
wait , why am i being suspended ?
i didn &apos;t leak any documents .
who told louis i did this ?
let &apos;s go please .
this way .
no , no , no , louis .
you have to stop this . i didn &apos;t turn rachel in .
that &apos;s so sweet how you didn &apos;t really mean to
hand someone in . wait , mike , stop .
you did a great thing .
and because of that great thing ,
$ 10,000 , and don &apos;t spend it in one place .
you say , &quot; thank you , louis . &quot;
and then , &quot; you &apos;re welcome , mike . &quot;
rachel .
i don &apos;t want to talk to you .
hey , come on .
you want &quot; come on &quot; ?
why would you do that to me ?
i didn &apos;t do anything to you .
i didn &apos;t fax that goddamn list .
and i didn &apos;t turn you in .
then why was i just suspended , mike ?
all i know is that i gave louis a stack of briefs
and there was some fax with your confidential code on it .
do you think that if i was gonna leak firm documents ,
i &apos;d be dumb enough to fax them with my own code ?
no , i don &apos;t ,
but whoever did this must have framed you .
yeah , well , it worked .
rachel , look , you just-- they &apos;re gonna investigate this .
they &apos;re gonna clear your name , you know that .
i &apos;ve worked there for five years ,
and this is how they treat me ?
i &apos;m suspended , mike .
i &apos;m probably gonna be fired .
i should sue them .
okay , let &apos;s not do anything rash , okay ?
it &apos;s not rash . it &apos;s standing up for myself .
rachel , you--
you &apos;re over @-@ react--
excuse me .
you wouldn &apos;t happen to know what sort of wine
pairs well with a duck l &apos;orange , would you ?
try something with a full fruit flavor ,
like a cabernet sauvignon .
eh , sauvignons are a little bit oaky for my palate .
this article right here
is all about the resurgence of pinot noir .
you know , you could just pay me right out in public .
but then i wouldn &apos;t feel like james bond .
oh , who &apos;s that make me ?
pussy galore .
octopussy ?
that &apos;s enough , harvey .
what do you have for me ?
nothing . on paper , tanner &apos;s clean .
he may break the rules , but he covers his tracks .
you &apos;ve never come up empty for me before .
i didn &apos;t this time either .
tanner booked a conference room
at the waldorf tomorrow at noon .
divide and conquer .
he &apos;s gonna gather my plaintiffs ,
scare them , and then give them a lowball offer .
and that &apos;s illegal .
what ?
you &apos;ve used me for a lot of things .
you &apos;ve never asked me to investigate
another attorney before .
this guy &apos;s good .
if he called your plaintiffs ,
i can get his phone records to prove it .
he didn &apos;t make those calls himself .
he &apos;s not gonna be at the waldorf either tomorrow .
but i will .
donna , can you tell me
about these confidential employee codes
that louis says rachel used to fax the witness list
over to wakefield @-@ cady ?
i have a thousand things to do before lunch .
hold mike &apos;s hand while he crosses the street ,
not one of them .
donna , this one &apos;s for rachel .
what do you need ?
i know we use the billing codes to charge the clients ,
but what do we use the employee codes for ?
they &apos;re special codes for when you need to use
the firm &apos;s resources for personal reasons .
we can do that ?
you can &apos;t , but rachel can .
why ?
because a fifth @-@ year paralegal
is more valuable to the firm than a first @-@ year associate .
okay , so do you have a personal code ?
i have two .
so where do you get them ?
they &apos;re generated by the i.t. department .
we have an i.t. department ?
the computers don &apos;t run themselves .
at least until skynet goes active .
sarah connor .
no .
no , i &apos;ll work on that .
really bad .
what ?
uh , hi , excuse me . i &apos;m looking for benjamin .
you found him .
oh , great , i &apos;m mike ross .
we just spoke on the phone .
man , this place is like battlestar galactica .
where do you guys keep the cylons ?
pearson @-@ hardman takes care of us
because we &apos;re on call 24 / 7 .
if a server goes down
or a partner &apos;s computer crashes ,
people die .
that &apos;s a little dramatic , don &apos;t you think , ben ?
it &apos;s benjamin .
i &apos;m sure you don &apos;t like it when people call you mike .
actually , i prefer mike .
well , mike , six months ago
i was at connolly white , the network went haywire ,
and we were in a breach of contract litigation
worth $ 400 million .
they needed it fixed in an hour .
no one thought it could be done .
i had the network up and running again in 23 minutes .
is that dramatic enough for you ?
wow , you &apos;re like a regular zuckerberg .
z @-@ zuckerberg ?
zuckerberg couldn &apos;t code his way out of a paper bag .
you called about the employee codes .
you &apos;re a first year . you can &apos;t have one , sorry .
okay , well , i don &apos;t need one .
i just want to know if it &apos;s possible
for someone to gain access to somebody else &apos;s code .
sure . for one person , me .
i have access to all of the codes .
okay , so in your short tenure here ,
has anyone ever asked you for access
to someone else &apos;s code ?
once . last week .
who ?
i can &apos;t tell you that .
why not ?
i.t. officer / client privilege .
does that even exist , ben ?
it does in here .
all right , ben , why don &apos;t we make a bet ?
i think you mean a wager , michael .
yeah , sure .
i &apos;m gonna tell you every single number on this piece of paper ,
and you &apos;re gonna give me that name .
and if you can &apos;t ?
then i &apos;m gonna give you this check for 10 grand .
you get one number , one comma , one decimal point wrong ,
and that money is mine .
oh , and when i win ,
i &apos;ll also take one of those computers .
and for the record ,
there &apos;s not a single comma on there .
you ready ?
rachel , it &apos;s mike .
i figured out who leaked the list to wakefield @-@ cady .
it was louis . call me back .
hi , i &apos;m rachel zane . i &apos;m here for my job interview .
welcome to wakefield @-@ cady .
thank you .
okay , as soon as we get inside
i need you to find every plaintiff you interviewed
and tell them they &apos;re here under false pretenses .
done .
kenny &apos;s meeting us here .
we need him to identify the man who came to see him ,
and we &apos;re gonna wait for that guy to approach
any of our plaintiffs .
and if we connect that guy to tanner ,
then we have him on criminal intimidation .
and emerson petroleum will have no choice but to settle .
hey , kenny . good to see you .
this is gonna be fun .
you were right .
he called every one of them .
you see the guy ?
no .
start looking .
hey , wait a minute .
mrs. williams , do you remember me ?
i &apos;m mike ross , from the office .
i remember you .
do you mind if i ask you what you &apos;re doing here today ?
we were invited to come and hear a settlement offer .
really ?
um , excuse me just for a minute .
he came here himself .
big mistake .
sorry to ruin your little brunch ,
but i think you know damn well
that you can &apos;t legally address my clients .
hey , i just came for the juice .
pulp free .
i know i can &apos;t talk to your clients directly .
but thank god you &apos;re here , harv .
because what i can do is i can talk to you .
harvey , emerson petroleum
is offering $ 25,000 to each and every one of your clients .
they don &apos;t take that ,
this trial stretches out for years .
cross @-@ examinations will be brutal .
you take our settlement ,
and this whole thing will be gone tomorrow .
now if any of your clients
want to get in touch with me ,
here &apos;s my number .
mr. ross .
harvey .
erase that number .
you &apos;re not gonna get away with what you &apos;re doing .
you know that , right ?
what ?
i just addressed you with a raised voice .
sometimes my ears aren &apos;t so good .
if other people heard me , i apologize , harvey .
i &apos;m just glad you were smart enough
to figure out i booked the waldorf .
mmm , i think i need to take this .
i &apos;m guessing it &apos;s one of your clients
wanting to take my settlement offer .
hello .
tanner . i &apos;m coming after you .
oh , i got your number .
plaintiffs are scared .
they &apos;re talking about accepting tanner &apos;s lowball offer .
those floodgates open and we &apos;re done .
that &apos;s why i went to go see clarkson .
the legal finance guys ?
if we can get our plaintiffs a loan
against a future jury award ,
it &apos;ll close the floodgates and buy us more time .
those loans aren &apos;t cheap , harvey .
well , it &apos;s better than settling for pennies on the dollar .
then do it .
i tried ,
but they won &apos;t give us anything without collateral .
they don &apos;t think you can win .
they &apos;re wrong .
that &apos;s what i like to hear .
i need a million dollars to get that loan .
are you talking about firm money ?
yeah .
no way that happens .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m a good bet ?
that has nothing to do with it .
this was your case .
and i gave it to you to win .
which i will do if you just show some faith in me .
you can have my faith ,
but you &apos;re not getting my money .
what are you doing here ?
i left you three messages .
louis framed you . we can take him down .
i don &apos;t want to take him down , mike .
why not ?
because i want a fresh start .
so you don &apos;t wanna work at pearson @-@ hardman anymore ?
i applied for a job at wakefield @-@ cady .
they offered it to me in the room .
i start monday .
you took a job at the company
that ended up with the leaked list ?
do you know what that looks like ?
i don &apos;t care what it looks like .
i &apos;m not guilty , and i need a job .
so the going gets rough , and you just quit ?
no , i &apos;m not quitting . i was fired , remember ?
no , you were suspended ,
and you could still save your job .
if louis wants me gone , i &apos;m gone .
rachel , louis tried to frame me once ,
and i fought back .
why aren &apos;t you doing the same thing ?
because except for you ,
no one from pearson @-@ hardman has contacted me at all .
why would i fight to stay there ?
they &apos;re accusing me of spilling secrets ?
i &apos;ll show &apos; em spilling secrets .
i &apos;ll tell wakefield @-@ cady everything .
i may not have a photographic memory , mike ,
but i sure as hell know a lot .
rachel .
moneypenny .
don &apos;t call me that .
why not ?
because she had a thing for him .
this is the other way around .
you don &apos;t like me ?
like you enough to give you this .
what &apos;s that ?
i tapped the phones at emerson petroleum .
this is a conference call between travis tanner
and several high @-@ ranking emerson executives .
i hope they &apos;re talking about more than just the weather .
they &apos;re talking about tanner intimidating your client .
both you and i know that without a warrant
this recording &apos;s not admissible in court .
it is if you testify that you don &apos;t know where it came from .
why &apos;d you do this ?
because you need it .
i &apos;m not gonna commit perjury to win a case .
oh , weird , look what i found .
you are a prince among men .
i don &apos;t understand why you use skim milk
and then put whipped cream and sugar in it .
because i use skim milk ,
i can put whipped cream and sugar in it .
what &apos;s wrong ?
can we talk for a second ?
yeah .
last week louis got rachel &apos;s confidential code
from the i.t. department .
and ?
and it &apos;s a smoking gun .
he &apos;s the one that set her up .
why would louis betray the firm ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe he &apos;s still upset
that he got passed over for senior partner
and leaked the list before he jumped ship .
mike , louis is a lot of things , but he &apos;s not a traitor .
that man bleeds pearson @-@ hardman .
he &apos;s probably wearing
pearson @-@ hardman underwear right now .
i went to the tennis club with him .
trust me , he doesn &apos;t wear underwear .
i care about rachel too .
louis didn &apos;t do this .
okay .
and if you ever mention
louis &apos; underwear situation to me again--
you &apos;re the one that brought it up .
go .
okay .
74 plaintiffs .
i can &apos;t believe they &apos;re willing to cave for $ 25,000 .
slow down .
we need to figure out how to beat tanner .
guy &apos;s been a step ahead of me this entire time .
it &apos;s pretty obvious why .
why ?
you told me that you knew he &apos;d go to kenny
because that &apos;s what you &apos;d do ,
if you were willing to go out of bounds .
you anticipated him by thinking about what you &apos;d do .
and ?
and that &apos;s exactly what he &apos;s doing to you .
maybe the only way to get ahead of this guy
is to , i don &apos;t know , think about what you wouldn &apos;t do .
surprise myself . i like that .
you &apos;re welcome .
you wanna tell me what you &apos;re doing ?
nope .
doesn &apos;t seem fair to the person whose idea it was .
you &apos;re gone .
you wanted to talk , talk .
i did .
i want to put this competition aside ,
call it a draw .
tapping out , harv ?
this isn &apos;t about that .
this is about real people .
you make them a reasonable offer ,
i &apos;ll get them to take it .
real people ?
you &apos;re standing there in a $ 12,000 suit
asking me not to do my job .
you care so much about those real people ,
i suggest you give them your lunch money
but don &apos;t ask me for mine .
vanessa , i &apos;m gonna need that wiretap after all .
is there any more of that ?
last cup .
did you make--
nope .
dude , that &apos;s common courtesy .
you finish a pot , you make another one .
you gonna turn me into louis if i don &apos;t ?
hmm ? get me fired too ?
michael .
benjamin , you got something for me ?
wager &apos;s a wager , fair is fair .
here &apos;s your gx @-@ 9000 .
you &apos;re a good man .
use it for porn , and i &apos;ll know .
weird .
hey , louis , how you doing ?
why did benjamin just call you louis ?
i don &apos;t know . made a mistake .
no , he didn &apos;t .
he called you louis because he thinks you are louis .
because you posed as louis
to get rachel &apos;s employee code ,
didn &apos;t you ?
look , mike , it &apos;s not what you think .
it &apos;s exactly what i think .
go on . start talking , jimmy ,
or i &apos;ll get get benjamin
and we can all go see jessica together .
listen ,
wakefield cady offered me a junior partnership
if i leaked the witness list .
no , no , listen , mike .
i have huge law school debts .
okay ? i mean , don &apos;t you ?
i can &apos;t wait for pearson hardman
to make me a partner .
so what are you still doing here then ?
after i gave them the list ,
they reneged on the offer .
big surprise .
i didn &apos;t see that one coming .
just don &apos;t turn me in , mike , please .
i came from nothing .
i worked my ass off to get into harvard law
and become an associate here .
you know who else worked their ass off ?
rachel zane , the paralegal who got fired
because of what you did .
i didn &apos;t know it was her code .
i just needed some numbers , man .
i didn &apos;t think i was gonna get caught .
look , mike , i made one mistake .
okay ?
i mean , haven &apos;t you ever cut some corners ,
done some things you regretted ?
jimmy , i like you , man , okay ?
but to clear rachel &apos;s name ,
they have to know she wasn &apos;t the one .
if you come forward ,
maybe they fire you .
if i turn you in ,
it &apos;s gonna follow you for the rest of your career .
it &apos;s up to you .
harvey , i &apos;m gonna do you a favor .
why don &apos;t you tell mike ross to take a hike ?
he can stay .
okay .
you see , 95 of your plaintiffs
have already called me about the settlement .
it &apos;s just a matter of time
before the rest of them see the light .
i win .
i don &apos;t know the last time you checked ,
but as of this morning
all 200 of my plaintiffs are staying with me .
bullshit .
i got them an advance against their settlement .
no finance company in their right mind
will back your suit .
i don &apos;t know if they taught you math at yale ,
but that &apos;s 5 million .
$ 25,000 a plaintiff .
exactly what you tried to buy them off for .
you know what this means ?
i &apos;m gonna hammer them all one by one ,
break them down , and it &apos;s gonna get ugly .
no , you &apos;re not .
what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s a conversation between you and emerson petroleum
discussing how you sent a man to intimidate kenny verdasco .
take a listen .
don &apos;t worry , it &apos;s not gonna give you cancer .
no matter what that is ,
it &apos;s not admissible .
unless of course you had a warrant , which you didn &apos;t .
showed up on my doorstep .
and i declared that in this affidavit
which i &apos;m about to send to court .
so you &apos;re gonna perjure yourself
just to win this case ?
no , i &apos;m not gonna perjure myself .
even if i were ,
it wouldn &apos;t be just to win this case .
it &apos;d be to get your ass thrown in jail .
see , you have power of attorney ,
and you &apos;re gonna accept this settlement ,
$ 2 million a plaintiff .
you &apos;re gonna take it .
and you and that shit eating grin
are gonna fly back to boston
and never come back to my town again .
you can use mine .
told you i &apos;d get his autograph .
i can &apos;t believe you .
you were gonna perjure yourself just to win .
i thought you didn &apos;t cross lines .
that &apos;s the difference between guys like you and him .
i had no intention of submitting this affidavit .
i &apos;m not gonna perjure myself ,
but tanner doesn &apos;t know that ,
and he never will .
how do you know ?
because a man who &apos;s willing to break the rules
can &apos;t imagine someone else wouldn &apos;t .
you said that you took my advice
and that you surprised yourself .
i did .
that loan i got for the plaintiffs ,
i put up a million dollars of my own money to get it .
if that &apos;s not having emotion ,
i don &apos;t know what is .
get out .
that seemed a little angry .
feeling good ? satisfied ? happy ?
all right .
emotional .
okay , maybe a little happy .
$ 2 million ?
didn &apos;t i tell you he was my right hand ?
i don &apos;t know what to say .
don &apos;t say anything .
tell me what it &apos;s like
when you deliver this news to everyone .
thank you .
told you i &apos;d win .
and it &apos;s a good thing too .
because if you hadn &apos;t , oh ...
what , oh ?
there &apos;s no way we &apos;re gonna cover that million dollars .
none of it ?
nope .
hey , how &apos;s your shoulder ?
amazing .
you called me ?
sure did .
have a seat .
i prefer to stand .
fair enough .
uh , i made a mistake .
you were unfairly punished ,
and i would like to officially
just welcome you back .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
are you kidding me ?
you think i &apos;m gonna make it that easy on you ?
i want a raise .
3 % .
10 % .
7 % .
10 % .
fine .
and pearson hardman pays for law school
when i decide to go .
agreed .
and one more thing .
this should &apos;ve been the first words out of your mouth
when i walked in here .
you need to apologize to me right now ,
or i &apos;m gonna file a lawsuit
against you first thing in the morning .
you &apos;re right .
i should have apologized .
but don &apos;t you threaten me .
i followed procedure to the letter ,
and you have no basis for a lawsuit .
no , i don &apos;t .
not about this .
but if you don &apos;t think i have a basis
for all the shit you &apos;ve pulled over the years i &apos;ve been here ,
think again .
i &apos;m sorry .
okay ?
how &apos;d it go ?
i don &apos;t know if you had plans tonight ,
but you &apos;re gonna cancel and help me put
my office back together .
sure thing .
so long as you don &apos;t quit halfway through .
thank you , mike .
yeah , sure thing .
so , where does this go ?
over there .
