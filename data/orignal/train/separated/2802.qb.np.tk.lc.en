janice has a question . who of the six of you ...
... has slept with who of the six of you ?
wow , it &apos;s like a dirty math problem .
i &apos;m sorry , the answer there would be none of us .
yeah . you know what ? lf that doesn &apos;t change soon ...
... l &apos;m going to dump you for somebody who puts out .
over the years , none of you ever got drunk and stupid ?
well , that &apos;s really a different question .
i can &apos;t believe a group of people who spends this much time together ...
... has never bumped uglies .
there was that one time monica and rachel got together .
what ?
excuse me , there was no &quot; time . &quot;
okay , but let &apos;s say there was .
how might that go ?
well then answer me this :
have any of you ever almost ... ?
anybody need more coffee ?
hey , there &apos;s a dog out there !
the one with the flashback
that is so unfortunate .
what ?
cute naked guy &apos;s starting to put on weight .
i &apos;ll be back in just a minute .
i &apos;m sorry that i left lipstick marks on the phone .
you didn &apos;t leave lipstick marks on the phone .
then it must have been you . bye .
bye @-@ bye .
that &apos;s why i moved out .
hey , while we &apos;re on that ...
... when are you gonna tell my sister you don &apos;t live here anymore ?
on some level , she already knows .
she doesn &apos;t know you sneak out every night ...
... and back every morning ...
... and that you &apos;ve been at your grandmother &apos;s for a week .
okay , well , maybe not on those levels .
you have got to tell her .
the longer you wait , the harder it is going to be on her .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
anyway , listen , tonight &apos;s bag ...
... is really bulky.so could you sneak stuff out for me ?
lt &apos;s just like a clock radio and some cemetery dirt .
i &apos;m never gonna find a roommate . ever .
nobody good ?
there was the guy with the ferrets .
that &apos;s plural .
the spitter . and the guy who enjoyed my name so much ...
... he made a noise every time he said it .
&quot; nice to meet you , chandler bing . bing ! &quot;
&quot; great apartment , chandler bing . bing ! &quot;
how many more tomorrow ?
two .
this photographer who seemed really dull ...
... and this actor guy who i &apos;m not sure about .
when i answered the phone &quot; chandler bing ... &quot;
... he said , &quot; whoa ! short message ! &quot;
foot on the floor or come over no more .
your dresser is missing , but this she notices .
what ?
i have to go .
carol should be home by now , so ....
how &apos;s it going with you guys ?
better , actually .
i finally figured out why we &apos;re having so much trouble .
oh , really ?
yeah . you know how i have you guys ?
she doesn &apos;t have any close friends that are just hers .
but last week , she met this woman at the gym , &quot; susan &quot; something .
and they really hit it off , and i think it &apos;s gonna make a difference .
so , eric ...
... what kind of photography do you do ?
oh , mostly fashion .
there may be models here sometimes . i hope that &apos;s cool .
yes , that is cool .
because i have models here , you know ...
... never .
during the summer i spend most weekends at my sister &apos;s beach house ...
... which you &apos;re welcome to use .
although i should tell you , she &apos;s a porn star .
well , i still have one more person to meet .
but unless it turns out to be your sister ...
... i think your chances are pretty good .
all right .
bedroom , bathroom , living room .
this here is the kitchen , and thanks for coming by . bye @-@ bye .

i would like to propose a toast ...

... mrs. dr. barry barber , d. d.s.
i think it &apos;s time to see the ring again .
isn &apos;t it exciting ? i mean , it &apos;s like having a boyfriend for life !
yeah . i know .
what ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
well , maybe it &apos;s just the idea ...
... of barry for the rest of my life .
i don &apos;t know , i think l ....
i feel like having one last fling ...
... just to sort of get it out of my system .
rachel , stop !
you &apos;re so bad !
i &apos;m serious . i really think i need to just have ...
... some meaningless sex , you know ?
with the next guy i see .
excuse me , i seem to have dropped my ball .

hi again .
thank you so much .
don &apos;t thank me . thank the jerk that never showed up .

you want some help ?
no , thanks . i got it .
no , i don &apos;t !
you okay ?
i stood up too fast . got a little head rush .
it &apos;s the heat .

like you wouldn &apos;t believe .
this is a great place .
thank you .
just make yourself comfortable .
gotcha .
so this place is really my grandmother &apos;s .
i got it when she moved to florida . otherwise i could never afford it .
