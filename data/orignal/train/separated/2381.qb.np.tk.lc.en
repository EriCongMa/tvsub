you took everything from me , klaus .
let bygones be bygones . resentment gets old .
you know what never gets old ? revenge .
no .
what &apos;s a matter , klaus ? missing something ?
three sleeping originals , four coffins .
who is in the locked box ?
he &apos;s been sired . feels loyal to klaus
because klaus &apos; blood created him .
he released me
from a curse that was ruining my life .
i owe him for that .
i need you to bite your girlfriend .
a hybrid bite would kill a vampire .
consider this me putting your undying loyalty to the test .
klaus can &apos;t control me . not when it comes to you .
oh , no .
did you just ... bite me ? !
caroline !
get away from me !
i figured out how to open it .
can you ?
let me out !
please !
oh , my god , oh , my god .
i &apos;m in here ! i &apos;m in here !
i &apos;m in here !
i &apos;ve been having these dreams for days now .
it &apos;s like the witches are trying to send me a message .
i just can &apos;t believe you guys
have kept this from me this whole time .
stefan thought if you knew where the coffins were ,
klaus could threaten people to get the information out of you .
so these are the rest of his family ?
yeah , elijah and two others .
now this one ...
is the one we can &apos;t open .
we don &apos;t know who &apos;s in it or what &apos;s in it ,
only that i think my dream &apos;s
telling me it &apos;ll help kill klaus .
what the hell are you doing ?
i needed her to know about the coffin .
and i needed you to keep her out of it , bonnie .
so what are you going to do , stefan ?
are you going to kidnap me so that i won &apos;t tell anyone ?
don &apos;t tempt me , elena .
i think i know who can open the coffin , stefan .
and i need elena to help me find her .
find who ? what are you talking about ?
i couldn &apos;t place her face at first .
then i realized ...
oh , my god , bonnie .
who is this ?
it &apos;s my mom .
los alamitos ?
um , too old .
honolulu ?
ugh , i wish .
how many of these are there ?
a lot . i asked the sheriff &apos;s office
to pull up every single abby bennett in the country .
i know we haven &apos;t been able to really ...
that things have been weird
because of jeremy . so thank you for helping me with this .
i know you have a lot to deal with .
there &apos;s nothing more important , bonnie .
it &apos;s surreal .
having to track down a woman who bailed on her own kid .
you know you don &apos;t have to , right ?
let stefan obsess over opening up the coffin .
it doesn &apos;t have to fall on you .
the coffin is spelled shut .
that makes it a witch problem .
so it does fall on me .
i was bound to see my mother again sooner or later .
sooner .
abby bennett wilson ,
monroe , north carolina .
born in mystic falls hospital ,
graduated mystic falls high ,
blah , blah , blah .
a little compulsion helps to speed up the research process .
this is her .
yep , road trip .
i call shotgun .
yeah , no .
why ? you want me to hang out in the back with you ?
you &apos;re not coming , damon .
why ? i &apos;m the one who found her .
ok , damon , look ,
bonnie hasn &apos;t seen her mom in over 15 years .
we don &apos;t need your snarky commentary narrating the experience .
what &apos;s going on with you two ?
we kissed . now it &apos;s weird .
have a great trip .
what are you doing here ?
i came to apologize .
apologize ?
you bit me . i could have died .
i think we &apos;re way past apologies , tyler .
that &apos;s the problem .
klaus told me to do it and i said no .
and then , it just happened anyway .
like it was completely out of my control .
that &apos;s why i had your mom call him .
daddy ?
hi , caroline .
i thought since he could resist compulsion ,
maybe he could teach me to resist a sire bond .
can you help him ?
i &apos;m going to try .
why ?
because he made a mistake .
and now he wants to make good .
and i understand that .
do you want anything else ? a beer ?
ah , i &apos;d love one , but i &apos;ve got rounds in 15 minutes .
and a drunk doctor is a bad doctor .
well , that depends on what kind of drunk you are .
angry .
thanks for lunch .
yeah , sure .
ah , so , um ,
next time , dinner ?
yeah , that would be great .
cool . take care .
bye . thanks .
who &apos;s that ?
my doctor .
she &apos;s a doctor ?
what &apos;s her damage ?
no damage .
come on , ric , it &apos;s a fact of life .
a girl that hot , that smart ... damage .
well , you know , i &apos;m looking for red flags .
her , uh , her ex called her a psycho case the other day .
yeah , but if it comes from her ex , it doesn &apos;t count .
i guess you &apos;re right . it &apos;s yours .
i wonder what my exes would call me .
nothing . they &apos;re all dead .
hmm . well , her ex is the medical examiner ,
so he &apos;s dead @-@ adjacent .
she dated the medical examiner ?
well , i don &apos;t think he &apos;s dead @-@ adjacent . i think he &apos;s just dead .
what ?
murdered .
sheriff &apos;s trying to keep a lid on it
because he was staked in the chest like a vampire .
well , meredith didn &apos;t say anything about that .
well , red flag number two .
who do you think killed him ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i was a cop , your sexy doctor lady friend
would definitely be a suspect .
what are you doing here , klaus ?
enjoying our stalemate .
what do you want ?
question is , what do you want ?
my hybrids left town as you demanded ,
so please tell me what i need to do to get my family back .
see , klaus ...
i &apos;m not negotiating .
and you understand that holding them indefinitely
is the same thing as dropping them in the ocean ?
no , no , you leave mystic falls
and then give me a call in a few years ,
and ... we &apos;ll talk .
i &apos;m going to give you another chance .
just one more .
let &apos;s make a reasonable deal .
or what ?
you make one move , and i will--
yes , that &apos;s right .
crazy stefan . mmm .
how &apos;s that working out for you ?
any friends left ?
i just can &apos;t believe i &apos;m actually going to see her .
or meet her . sort of .
since i don &apos;t really remember her .
you don &apos;t really talk about her .
what &apos;s to say ?
she left , never wrote , never called .
not even when my grams died .
can we talk about you and damon instead ?
i &apos;m not talking about it .
he kissed me . it &apos;s not going to happen again .
i mean ...
was it good ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
that means it was .
it &apos;s stefan .
i told him i &apos;d call him as soon as i got the address .
ignore .
bonnie , you &apos;re about to see your mom for the first time
in 15 years . i &apos;m not letting anyone ruin that moment .
yeah , but he &apos;s going to keep at it until i pick up .
fine .
what ?
where are you ?
bonnie and i are going to spend the night at the lake house
while we wait for sheriff forbes to give us some more addresses .
you &apos;re kidding me , right ?
no , stefan , i &apos;m not .
we need a night off from your insanity .
klaus is getting antsy .
he knows i &apos;m stalling him .
we need to move faster .
well , we &apos;re doing everything we can .
so could you maybe not call every 5 minutes ?
sure , elena .
whatever you say .
how &apos;s life on the road ?
scenic . how &apos;s life in mystic falls without any hybrids ?
boring . for now .
if you want any of us back , you just have to say the word .
there &apos;s no need .
i &apos;ve been making friends with the town &apos;s civil servants .
there &apos;s a deputy who &apos;s awfully chatty ,
but useful nonetheless .
are you clear on what you need to do ?
i &apos;ve got it covered .
can i help you ?
abby bennett wilson ?
that &apos;s me .
cute house .
yeah , for the middle of nowhere .
you ready ?
hey there .
hey , we &apos;re looking for , um ,
abby wilson .
she &apos;s not home .
is there anything i can do for you ?
that &apos;s ok , we can come back .
i &apos;m sorry , but you look so familiar .
yeah , abby &apos;s my mom .
i &apos;m jamie .
you guys want to come inside ?
right this way .
you guys sure you don &apos;t want anything ?
we got fresh o.j. , coconut water ,
some mango guava something .
water &apos;s fine .
cool .
so , ahem , are we like related ?
oh , no . abby &apos;s not my mom .
oh . good .
yeah , she , uh , she dated my old man back in the day .
he was kind of a deadbeat ,
so when they broke up , she took me in .
put me through school . didn &apos;t freak out when i totaled her car .
twice .
she sounds ... great .
jamie ?
whose car &apos;s out front ?
that &apos;s mine .
i &apos;m bonnie .
your daughter .
hello , bonnie .
how do you know this is going to work ?
it &apos;s a process . it took decades
to train myself to resist compulsion .
the brain &apos;s like a muscle .
the more you use it , the more it can do .
a sire bond , at its core , is about one thing--
gratitude .
if you believe you owe klaus your life ,
ask yourself why .
i was cursed .
every full moon , i had to change into a wolf .
it was torture . klaus took that away .
freed you from your pain
and you feel indebted to him .
to break the sire bond ,
you &apos;ve got to make yourself turn .
own your pain ,
then you &apos;ll owe klaus nothing and you &apos;ll be free .
but how can he turn ? it &apos;s not a full moon .
he doesn &apos;t need one . you &apos;re a hybrid now , right ?
i mean , you can turn at will or not , am i right ?
yeah , but i don &apos;t know how to just ... start .
now you &apos;re making excuses .
you don &apos;t understand ! when i turn ,
i break every bone in my body .
you asked for my help . this is the only way .
how badly do you want your freedom ?
ok .
ok .
how are you holding up ?
oh . i &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;m not here to get my mom back ,
i &apos;m just here to get her help .
so i hope you guys are hungry .
&apos;cause , uh , food has always been my go @-@ to icebreaker .
you have a really beautiful home .
you &apos;re so sweet . just like your mom .
you knew my mom ?
miranda was my best friend .
so you had a daughter and a best friend and you still left ?
my best friend is why i left .
15 years ago ,
a vampire came to town .
looking for you , elena ,
looking for the doppelganger .
no one could manage to kill him ,
so i lured him out of town
and cast a spell to desiccate him .
and encrypt him in charlotte .
mikael .
he was an original vampire .
it took every ounce of power i had .
almost killed me .
i recovered .
but my magic didn &apos;t .
my powers never came back .
and neither did you .
it wasn &apos;t that simple .
it wasn &apos;t ?
you cast a spell , put mikael down , then ...
what ? you had to teach jamie how to drive ?
bonnie ...
this was a mistake .
she has no magic , she can &apos;t help us .
bonnie , wait , please .
don &apos;t go . talk to me .
please ?
i &apos;ll wait outside .
hi , elena . nice lake house .
you know , we never got a chance to officially meet .
doctor ... fell .
you &apos;re alaric &apos;s friend , right ?
damon salvatore .
saw you at the council meeting .
what are you doing here ?
strolling the halls .
i like to wave at the newborns through the window .
sorry about your boyfriend .
animal attack .
brutal .
ex @-@ boyfriend .
and thanks . i &apos;m still kind of processing .
yeah , i &apos;m sure . you know , i just thought i &apos;d come by
and tell you that it wasn &apos;t an animal attack .
and then i realized .
you signed the death certificate .
would you rather i say he was staked like a vampire ?
wasn &apos;t he the guy that coined the phrase &quot; animal attack &quot; ?
why do you even care ?
because rick likes you .
and if you &apos;re a psychopath ,
it would probably really suck for him .
you think i killed my ex @-@ boyfriend ?
i think psychopaths are incredibly high @-@ maintenance .
if you care about your friend ,
go figure out how alaric came into the icu on his deathbed
and walked out an hour later without a scratch .
fair enough .
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t .
try harder .
can &apos;t he just rest for one second ? !
we &apos;re doing this my way , caroline .
if you can &apos;t handle it , you should go .
he &apos;s right , caroline . just go .
no , tyler !
go , caroline .
what are you doing ?
what the hell , man ?
does it bother you ?
knock it off !
good .
get angry . it &apos;s in you . you know it is .
i said knock it off !
your bond to klaus is putting my daughter in danger .
now either you turn
or i kill you right here , right now .
you &apos;ve grown into such a beautiful young woman , bonnie .
please , just stop with the muffins and the compliments .
i just want to know the truth--
why didn &apos;t you come home ?
i had no magic .
i was in a new city ,
and i realized i had a chance to be somebody else .
to be abby wilson , the woman ...
not abby bennett , the witch .
i &apos;m not proud of what i did , bonnie .
i ran .
i know i ran . but you had your dad
and your grams , and , ok , let &apos;s face it--
your grams is way better at this stuff than i am .
you don &apos;t know ?
what ?
how ?
we were doing a rough spell ...
and we both exhausted ourselves .
her more than me .
well , she raised you right .
i &apos;m sure she was very proud of you .
well , now you know my whole story .
yep .
how about you tell me yours ?
what brings you to me ?
it was a dream , actually .
i thought you were supposed to help us .
but if you don &apos;t have any magic , it &apos;s ...
well , no spells , no .
but i &apos;m not completely useless .
i mean , the earth still provides herbs and such .
there might be something i can do .
i ... don &apos;t think so .
bonnie , please .
let me help you .
so what , you &apos;d think i wouldn &apos;t find out ?
honestly , i didn &apos;t care .
this is exactly why i didn &apos;t want you in the loop , elena .
yeah , because now you can &apos;t do whatever you want .
damn it !
hey !
everything all right out here ?
hey . jamie , go back inside , ok ?
please . trust me .
it &apos;s better off for you there .
i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;d listen to her . get back upstairs , man .
i said i don &apos;t think so .
get back upstairs
before i tear your damn throat out , do you understand me ?
i don &apos;t think you realize how bad you &apos;ve gotten !
this is the way it has to be , elena .
oh , yeah , right .
out @-@ villain the villain .
i get it .
you &apos;re not supposed to be here .
jamie , what are you doing ?
what i was told .
he &apos;s not supposed to be here .
elena , he &apos;s compelled .
what was that ? !
what are you doing here ?
ah , looking for a bunny .
you &apos;re good . for now .
you still obsessed with meredith ?
ah . i mean , don &apos;t you have an original vampire to worry about ?
ah , ah , ah , do ten more of those .
you &apos;re going to want to buff up if you start dating this one .
self defense and all .
what is your problem ?
your doctor vervained me .
and then she bloodjacked me .
what ? i mean , when did you even see her ?
when i went to the hospital
to accuse her of killing her ex @-@ boyfriend .
which , by the way , very sensitive subject .
damon , what the hell are you doing , huh ?
why are you mad at me ?
i told you i &apos;d handle this !
i proved your theory-- diagnosed psycho case .
you &apos;re welcome .
why are you doing this ?
stop moving .
jamie , let me go . jamie , he needs help .
jamie !
bonnie !
bonnie !
oh , my god .
these chains aren &apos;t strong enough .
you need to leave . run !
so ?
she didn &apos;t tell me where the coffins are .
the vampire showed up .
did jamie take care of him ?
he did .
but she &apos;s not going to talk now . there &apos;s no way . i tried .
well , you should try again .
what did you do to me ?
you &apos;ll be fine .
but don &apos;t try and use spells .
those herbs i used muted your magic .
where &apos;s elena ? !
she &apos;ll be fine , too .
bonnie , listen to me . i need your help .
i need you to tell me where those coffins are .
why ?
because if you don &apos;t ,
that man compelled jamie to kill himself .
i can &apos;t .
this goes beyond you and me .
all you need to do is tell me where they are .
then we &apos;ll have held up our end of the bargain .
bonnie , please .
i &apos;ve almost got it .
abby hasn &apos;t called yet .
jamie , please , just let us go .
no ! please , don &apos;t do anything .
look , i don &apos;t know why i shot him .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m holding this gun ,
but if you move or do anything ,
i &apos;m going to shoot him again .
ok , i won &apos;t .
who gave you that gun ?
a man came by here earlier today .
he said it was wooden buckshot .
told me if anyone got in our way ,
i &apos;m supposed to shoot &apos; em .
what else did he say ?
if abby didn &apos;t find the location of some coffins ...
i &apos;m supposed to shoot myself .
what about me ?
what did he say about me ?
i &apos;m not supposed to hurt you .
are you sure ? because ...
these ropes are so tight that it is hurting me .
what can i do to help ?
every time i move , the wood shifts inside of me .
i can feel it scraping against my heart .
you need to get the pieces out .
what took you so long ?
hiding behind your witchy friends .
and in squalor , no less .
insulting a bunch of dead witches ... not smart .
i made the exact same mistake first time i came in here .
well , you know the funny thing about the witches
is that living or dead , they care about their own .
a hundred dead witches have a thousand living descendents ...
and i have no problem killing every last one of them
if i don &apos;t get my coffins back .
as we speak , my hybrid friend is prepared
to end the bennett line .
now .
please ...
show me the coffins .
here we are .
where &apos;s the fourth ?
show me !
well , ehh , here &apos;s the thing .
they can &apos;t .
it &apos;s not here .
what did you do ?
well , bonnie gave me the head &apos;s up .
i mean , i didn &apos;t have enough time to get all four ,
but i did have time to get one .
i will tear you limb from limb .
and only then ,
when you are a writhing mass of blood and flesh ,
will i rip your heart from your chest .
sorry . same rules apply .
leverage and all .
i know you want your family back .
but something tells me you want what &apos;s in that coffin a lot more .
you want to tell me what you &apos;re up to ?
you talked to damon .
yeah , i did .
he wasn &apos;t supposed to wake up so soon .
i used enough vervain to sedate him for hours .
well , he drinks it , every day .
to build up an immunity so people like you
don &apos;t get the jump on him . i &apos;m not crazy , ric .
really ? then what are you ?
watch your back .
you really want to know ?
stick around .
is that bill forbes ?
i &apos;m just trying to help !
just get it out , elena , please .
just get it out .
if you keep squirming , maybe i &apos;ll feel sorry for you .
you &apos;ve changed .
something &apos;s different about you .
you &apos;re stronger . tougher .
you &apos;re not the only one who changed , stefan .
we all had to .
that &apos;s good to know .
there &apos;s something i have to tell you .
and it &apos;s not because i feel guilty that it happened .
it &apos;s because i feel guilty that you don &apos;t know .
i kissed damon .
there . all done .
what happened to him ?
he was found in the woods .
an actual animal attack .
bite marks and gashes over half his body .
lost about 3 liters of blood .
well , is he going to make it ?
nope .
at least not on his own .
what is that ?
exactly what you think it is .
vampire blood .
you wanted to know my secret ?
i cheat . i &apos;m a doctor and i hate when people die .
so when i have the ability to do something about it ,
i do .
stefan ...
say something .
please .
i shouldn &apos;t have kidnapped you .
the car , the bridge , it was too far .
thank you .
but you shouldn &apos;t have lied to me today .
you can &apos;t go off and do things like that , elena .
not while klaus is still alive .
i know .
i just ... i wanted to give bonnie
a moment with her mother
without everything else getting in the way .
without me getting in the way .
i didn &apos;t plan on kissing him .
you &apos;re better than him , elena .
you &apos;re better than both of us .
elena &apos;s on her way .
jamie &apos;s safe .
he &apos;s a little bruised , but he &apos;s safe .
do you think the hybrid will come back ?
you kept your end of the bargain .
klaus usually keeps his .
you &apos;re willing to do all of this for him ....
and he &apos;s not even your family .
he is my family , bonnie .
i know that might be hard for you to hear ,
but he is .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that i don &apos;t care about you .
i want to help you .
you can &apos;t .
you have no magic and i don &apos;t trust you .
when i put mikael down ,
my magic didn &apos;t just leave me .
it drifted away .
the longer i stayed away from you ,
the weaker it got .
i think nature was punishing me for abandoning you .
maybe you can help me get my magic back .
i thought you said you didn &apos;t want it anymore .
i don &apos;t .
but if it &apos;s what you wanted ...
i would do that for you .
you &apos;re better .
yeah . i shouldn &apos;t be , but i didn &apos;t have any say in the matter .
i didn &apos;t mean to hurt you .
i lost control .
again .
i knew the risks when i decided to help you .
so ...
was it worth it ? how do you feel ?
different . a little more myself .
then we &apos;ll continue tomorrow .
what are you talking about ? i turned .
once . to break the sire bond ,
turning needs to be painless .
and from what i saw today ...
we &apos;re still a long way off .
i can &apos;t put myself through that again .
you will .
because until you &apos;re capable of acting on your own free will ,
i &apos;m not going to let you anywhere near my daughter .
you told me your secret .
this is mine .
you &apos;re a vampire hunter .
semi @-@ retired .
you &apos;re trying to get out of taking me to dinner , aren &apos;t you ?
just want to be honest .
no secrets .
ok . then tell me how
you survived getting hit by a truck .
your injuries were fatal .
was it vampire blood ?
that , and , uh ...
this ring protects me from death
at the hands of supernatural beings .
a vampire hunter who can &apos;t be killed by vampires .
convenient .
are you worried i &apos;m a supernatural being ?
one can never be ... too careful .
sorry .
i &apos;m gonna go .
ok , yeah , sure , sure , sure .
elena , i am--i &apos;m sorry .
please , it--it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s not ok , elena .
i mean , this is not even my place . it &apos;s--it &apos;s your place .
it &apos;s jenna &apos;s place . it &apos;s your family-- it &apos;s your family &apos;s place .
the minute that you slept on that couch ,
it became your place , too .
we needed you , and ...
and you stayed .
so thank you for that .
hey , look , i know it &apos;s hard .
but jenna &apos;s gone .
and you &apos;re allowed to move on .
you &apos;re still alive ?
i assume that means klaus didn &apos;t get his coffins .
well , don &apos;t look so happy .
i was only able to get one of them out in time .
the locked one .
probably a good choice .
you know , if you &apos;re banking on bonnie &apos;s mama to open it ,
you &apos;re screwed .
she doesn &apos;t have any powers .
doesn &apos;t surprise me .
it &apos;s been that kind of night .
is elena ok ?
i take it you two had a heart to heart .
and i take it you don &apos;t want to talk about it .
noted .
so why don &apos;t we talk about this ?
what did you do ?
you have your family back . finally .
you &apos;re going to open them ?
not quite yet .
i still have some unfinished business to take care of .
what business ?
so , niklaus ...
elijah ?
