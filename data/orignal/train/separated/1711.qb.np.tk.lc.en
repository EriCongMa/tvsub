hi . did sheldon change the wi @-@ fi password again ?
yeah , it &apos;s &quot; penny already eats our food .
she can pay for wi @-@ fi . &quot;
no spaces .
okay .
if you can &apos;t get me to stop eating your food ,
what makes you think you can get me to stop using your wi @-@ fi ?
i believe that you &apos;re capable of great change .
like when i finally got you to stop saying &quot; valentimes day &quot; &quot;
you want to hear something weird ?
sure .
in the year 2000,
pope john paul ii was named an honorary harlem globetrotter .
what are you talking about ?
you asked penny if she wanted to hear something weird .
yeah , because i have something weird to tell her .
i thought it was a game .
what &apos;s yours ?
there &apos;s this guy , jimmy speckerman ,
who used to torment me in high school .
he sent me a message through facebook .
he &apos;s in town and wants to have drinks .
okay , penny , if it were a game , here are your choices .
an e @-@ mail from an old acquaintance ,
or the head of one of the largest religious institutions
in the world slam dunking to &quot; sweet georgia brown . &quot; pick .
just do it , &apos; cause he &apos;s not gonna let it go .
basketball pope .
and that &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
what are you gonna do about your bully ?
are you gonna see him ?
i don &apos;t know .
is this the fellow who peed in your hawaiian punch ?
no , that was a different guy .
was he the one who wedgied you so hard ,
your testicle reascended ,
and you spent your whole christmas break
waiting for it to come back down ?
no , that was a different , different guy .
was he the one who used your head to open a nut ?
no .
oh , oh , oh .
was he the one who made you eat your arm hair ?
no , but , actually ,
that was this guy &apos;s sister .
all right , well , what do you think he wants ?
i don &apos;t know .
you know , the holidays are just around the corner .
maybe he wants to see if he can lodge
the other testicle up there .
i told you . that was a different guy .
hmm . that &apos;s too bad . we could have spent
new year &apos;s eve waiting for the ball to drop .
零点倒数时会有一个球掉下来
it &apos;s 2 : 00 a.m. what are you doing up ?
nobel prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from stockholm .
sure . you want to see
what all the scientists are wearing this year .
look at these men .
they &apos;ve managed to win the top science prize in the world
with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings
of the expansion of the early universe
than god gave a goose .
you should pay attention , leonard .
someday this could be you up there .
thanks .
so , what &apos;s got you up ?
did you have a bad clam ?
i didn &apos;t have clams .
i don &apos;t watch you 24 hours a day .
i don &apos;t know what you do .
it &apos;s this jimmy speckerman thing .
i can &apos;t decide if i should agree to see him or not .
of course that might be
because the last time i ran into him ,
he made me floss with my own shoelaces .
wear loafers .
look at dr. saul perlmutter up there ,
因观察超新星而发现宇宙加速膨胀获2011年诺贝尔物理学奖
clutching that nobel prize .
what &apos;s the matter , saul ?
you afraid someone &apos;s going to steal it ?
like you stole einstein &apos;s cosmological constant ?
you know what ?
i am tired of living in fear of this guy .
i &apos;m gonna go see him and finally say
all the things i should have said in high school .
you know , &quot; pick on someone your own size &quot;
&quot; you did not have sex with my mother . &quot;
and &quot; yes , i do know why i &apos;m hitting myself . &quot;
oh , now perlmutter &apos;s shaking the king &apos;s hand .
yeah , check for your watch , gustaf .
he might have lifted it .
i love this dress .
how come i never see you wear it ?
&apos;cause when i wear it , it &apos;s a shirt .
so , what &apos;s howard doing tonight ?
oh , they all went with leonard to confront his childhood bully .
oh , terrific .
high school quarterback against four mathletes .
when leonard gets back ,
i &apos;d love to check his serotonin levels .
do you think he &apos;d let me draw a syringe full of his blood ?
hmm , he &apos;s not crazy about needles ,
but if you get him to go jogging ,
it &apos;ll just pour out of his nose .
i don &apos;t think i can meet the girl
who was always mean to me .
tammy bodnick .
one time while i was in gym class ,
she stole all my clothes
and left an elf costume in my locker .
oh , that &apos;s awful .
worst part was , it was too big .
that &apos;s nothing .
in ninth grade , the girls put rogaine in my hand lotion .
within six months , the nicknames began to fly .
i think the one that hurt the most was gorilla fingers fowler .
wow . you poor thing .
what about you ?
oh .
i don &apos;t know . i guess my school was a nice place .
we didn &apos;t really have bullies .
come on , no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames
or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles
so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out ?
no , we weren &apos;t really like that .
i mean , look , we played pranks on each other ,
but it was never mean .
like , okay , this one girl , kathy geiger ,
got really good grades , so we blindfolded her ,
tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight .
oh , my god , that &apos;s awful .
no , it was funny . everyone laughed .
did kathy geiger laugh ?
uh , probably . it &apos;s hard to say .
she kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth .
who would have thought
fuzzy fingers fowler is best friends with a bully ?
what ? i was not a bully .
kind of sounds like you were .
and maybe a felon .
shh . that &apos;s how you wind up in a cornfield .
is that him over there ?
no .
how about that guy ?
he looks like he &apos;d hate you .
you know , i can really do this by myself .
hey , we &apos;re here to support you , buddy .
no , you &apos;re not . you &apos;re here to see
if i get my underwear pulled over my head .
you wore underwear ? you fool .
so , have you figured out what you &apos;re going to say to him ?
you bet . i am going to make him apologize
for all the crap he pulled on me in school .
that &apos;s quite a list .
i can &apos;t read your handwriting .
what &apos;s that word ?
&quot; scrotum . &quot;
what &apos;s that one ?
uh , &quot; stapled . &quot;
leonard .
oh , hi .
holy crap , man , it &apos;s good to see you .
yeah . you , too . uh , jimmy , this is
sheldon and raj and howard .
hi . fellas ... hey , can i get a beer ?
wow . look at you .
little leonard hofstadter .
i hear you &apos;re a big @-@ time scientist now .
and there &apos;s the first zinger . ouch .
i &apos;m doing okay , i guess .
okay ? come on , i read online
you &apos;re a physicist at a university ,
you won some medal .
the newcomb medal .
yeah , congratulations .
congratulations ?
the newcomb medal ? oh , please .
that &apos;s the scientific equivalent
of a smiley face sticker on your homework .
from what i read , it sounded like a big deal .
oh , good lord , are we going to stand here
and listen to him tear leonard apart like this ?
hey , i won a newcomb medal , too .
my point .
you should have seen this guy back in the day .
huh ? he was so little , he could fit in just about anywhere .
lockers , trash cans .
oh , man , how did you get inside that backpack ?
oh , i can &apos;t take all the credit .
you helped a lot .
yeah .
we were practically a comedy team .
like the black death and europe .
jimmy , i &apos;m kind of curious why you wanted to see me .
okay , here it is .
i have this great money @-@ making idea .
i just need a gear head to get it to the finish line .
technically , howard &apos;s the gear head .
leonard &apos;s just a dime store laser jockey .
what &apos;s the idea ?
this is just between us , right ?
right .
okay .
what do you think about a pair of glasses
that makes any movie you want into 3d ?
that sounds amazing .
first movie i &apos;m watching-- annie .
how exactly would these glasses work ?
how the hell should i know ? that &apos;s why i need a nerd .
i don &apos;t think something like that &apos;s even possible .
aw , come on , you can figure it out .
you &apos;re like the smartest guy i &apos;ve ever known .
the smartest ... ? ! all right ,
you know , i may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm ,
but even i know that was a doozy .
leonard , you can &apos;t live in fear of this man forever .
sheldon , i got this .
you clearly don &apos;t .
what my spineless friend lacks the courage to say
is you &apos;re a terrible person
who took advantage of his tiny size ,
his uncoordinated nature and
his congenital lack of masculinity .
sheldon ...
leonard , i platonically love you , man ,
but face it , you &apos;re a mess .
i don &apos;t understand .
i think what he &apos;s trying to say is that maybe in high school
you picked on me a little bit .
a little bit ?
the man super glued hershey &apos;s kisses to your nipples .
that &apos;s funny because those aren &apos;t the kind of kisses
you want on your nipples .
what is that ?
this is a list of your heinous acts against leonard .
one of which is certainly the cause
of him wetting his bed well into his teens .
14 is not ... aw , never mind .
what &apos;s this word ?
&quot; nancy . &quot;
you called me nancy for three years .
you really need to work on your penmanship .
oh , man , i ...
i don &apos;t know what to say .
i always thought we were just having some fun .
it wasn &apos;t fun for me .
you &apos;re being too kind , leonard .
you ruined him .
come on , guys .
that was pretty badass , dude .
i help the weak .
it &apos;s yet another way i &apos;m exactly like batman .
hey , for the record , jimmy wasn &apos;t the reason i wet the bed .
that one has my mother written all over it .
anyway , i &apos;m really sorry
i made fun of your stutter in high school .
you &apos;re doing great .
oh , god , just finish the sentence .
okay , well , i &apos;m sorry you feel that way . bye .
no one wants to hear my apologies .
i think your mistake is doing it over the phone .
if they could look into your eyes , they &apos;d melt .
penny , it doesn &apos;t matter what you did in the past .
you &apos;re a good person now .
that &apos;s easy for you to say .
you weren &apos;t just called a &quot; b @-@ b @-@ b @-@ b @-@ bitch . &quot;
perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism .
which word &apos;s tripping you up ?
&quot; assuage , &quot; or &quot; altruism &quot; ?
both .
you &apos;ll feel better by doing something nice for someone .
i actually knew that .
i never doubted you .
every other week i serve at a soup kitchen downtown .
ooh , i can &apos;t do that .
if i stand over a steaming pot , my hair just goes boing !
what else could i do ?
there &apos;s habitat for humanity --
building houses for the poor .
okay , come on , i don &apos;t even have my own house --
i &apos;m going to build one for someone else ?
how about donating some of your clothes ?
oh , my god , that &apos;s perfect .
&apos;cause i have so many clothesi don &apos;t wear ,
and they &apos;re just taking up space ,
and i go shopping to buy more stuff
and i have no place to put it .
this will totally fix that .
what about helping people ?
and helping people .
here &apos;s your cocoa .
oh , half and half instead of whole milk ?
yes .
heated to precisely 183 degrees ?
yes .
seven little marshmallows , no more no less ?
you got one for good luck .
i &apos;ll get it .
one for good luck .
must be the kind of math they do at princeton .
what are you doing here ?
i want to apologize for ... stapling your balls and ...
... throwing you naked in the girls &apos; locker room ,
stuffing that parrot down your pants .
what &apos;s this word ?
&quot; laxative . &quot;
oh , right .
junior prom .
that was not cool , man .
i am so , so sorry .
really ?
yeah . i just hope you can forgive me .
yeah .
sure , i guess .
you &apos;re a beautiful guy .
well , thanks , jimmy .
okay , i got to go .
are you okay to drive ?
yeah , yeah , yeah . i drive better drunk .
you know , it makes you pay attention .
no , no , no , come on in . i &apos;ll make you a cup of coffee .
i wouldn &apos;t be imposing ?
no .
yes .
sheldon , we can &apos;t let him drive .
then take away his keys and make him wander the streets
with the other drunks .
you remember sheldon and raj and howard .
not really , no .
it &apos;s funny , huh , leonard ?
back in school , i was the winner and you were the loser .
and now we &apos;re reversed .
you &apos;re the winner .
you &apos;d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa .
you mind if i use your bathroom ?
yeah , just back there .
how about that ?
after all these years , your big bad high school bully
finally apologizes .
yeah . it kind of rekindles your faith
in the basic goodness of people .
you know what would be nice ?
what &apos;s that ?
as a symbolic gesture
to all the bullies who &apos;ve tormented us for years ,
we open our home to jimmy and once he &apos;s asleep we kill him .
i said it would be nice-- i didn &apos;t say we should do it .
i feel just like mother teresa .
except for the virgin part .
that ship sailed a long time ago .
i think mother teresa would have washed the clothes first .
yeah , well , i bet her laundry room
wasn &apos;t down five flights of stairs .
you know , giving really is better than receiving .
i used to think it was such a cliche , but it seems to be the ...
look at these cute jeans someone just threw away .
donated .
yes , to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut .
penny .
come on , they would be so cute on me ...
they go great with this sweater !
i don &apos;t think mother teresa ...
oh , that is adorable .
leonard .
yeah .
in case it comes up again ,
this right here is an imposition .
what was i supposed to do ?
he needed a place to sleep it off .
you &apos;re soft .
this world &apos;s going to chew you up and spit you out .
when did i have tacos ?
morning , jimmy .
oh , there it is , tacos .
man , i tied one on .
yeah , you did .
so , uh , listen , it was great to see you again .
and thanks for the apology .
what apology ?
for all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school .
geez , you &apos;re still harping on that ?
what a puss .
that &apos;s my french toast .
it &apos;s good .
you really know your way around a kitchen , nancy .
i &apos;m not going to say i told you so ,
but we could have killed him .
i might kill him right now .
the dark knight has your back .
he &apos;s scared , but he has your back .
okay , jimmy , it &apos;s time for you to go .
yeah , all right , let me just finish this .
no , you &apos;re done . i want you out of my apartment right now .
well said , boy wonder .
or what ?
don &apos;t answer that . it &apos;s a trick question .
i speak from experience .
i &apos;m not afraid of you anymore , jimmy .
now get out !
you did it , leonard , you stood up to your bully .
yeah , i feel pretty good about myself .
you think we can outrun him ?
i don &apos;t need to outrun him , i just need to outrun you .
i don &apos;t feel good about this .
then sit in the car and keep it running .
you were right-- a whole new load .
come on , yoga top . mama needs a new yoga top .
check it out , bernadette , suede boots , your size .
god , they &apos;re cute .
oh , why did they have to be cute ?
wait , wait , wait , guys , just hang on .
what is it , the fuzz ?
look at us .
what are we doing ?
i was gleefully following you to a life of crime ,
looking forward to the day we might be cell mates .
i don &apos;t know about bernadette .
you know , this is wrong . let &apos;s put everything back .
here .
it &apos;s okay , i serve soup to poor people !
