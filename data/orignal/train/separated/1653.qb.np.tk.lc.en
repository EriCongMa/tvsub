what &apos;s this ?
that &apos;s what you did .
i assumed , as in a number of languages ,
that the gesture was part of the phrase .
well , it &apos;s not .
how am i supposed to know that ? as the teacher , it &apos;s your obligation
to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter .
you know , i &apos;m really glad you decided to learn mandarin .
why ?
once you &apos;re fluent ,
you &apos;ll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me .
mei du lui zi .
you just called leonard a syphilitic donkey .
my apologies ,
i &apos;m only as good as my teacher .
why are you learning chinese ?
i believe the szechuan palace has been passing off
orange chicken as tangerine chicken and i intend to confront them .
if i were you , i &apos;d be more concerned
about what they are passing off as chicken .
i need to use your window .
sure , go ahead .
hey , jerk face , you forgot your ipod !
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s going on .
that stupid self @-@ centered bastar wrote about our sex life in his blog .
drop dead , you stupid self @-@ centered bastard !
thank you .
okay , where were we ?
not now , i have a blog to find .
the big bang theory s01e17 ( finale )
penny , are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine , leonard. just go away !
i understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful ...
go away !
okay , feel better ! bye !
she doesn &apos;t want to talk .
not surprising. penny &apos;s emotional response is originated
in the primitive portion of the brain , known as the amygdala .
while speech is centered in the
much more recently developed neo @-@ cortex .
the former can easily overpower the latter ,
giving scientific credence to
the notion of being &quot; rendered speechless . &quot;
or maybe she just doesn &apos;t want to talk .
look , i found an ipod !
it &apos;s smashed beyond repair. what are you gonna do with it ?
what else ? sell it on ebay as &quot; slightly used . &quot;
it was penny &apos;s boyfriend &apos;s , they broke up .
apparently , he posted intimate details of their physical relationship
on his blog which i cannot find anywhere .
i &apos;m gonna go back and try talking to her again .
good idea , sit with her .
hold her , comfort her .
and if the moment feels right ,
see if you can cop a feel .
i &apos;m not going to do that , howard .
i &apos;m not aware of a new social
convention that requires you to intervene at all .
what about damsel in distress ?
twelfth century code of chivalry ? not exactly current .
you &apos;d also have to be knighted for that to apply .
i don &apos;t care. she &apos;s upset , i &apos;m going over there .
remember to sit on your hands a bit , so they &apos;re warm .
i &apos;m her friend .
i &apos;m not going to take advantage of her vulnerability .
so you &apos;re saying , if in the depths of despair ,
she throws herself at you and demands you take her ,
right there , right now , you &apos;ll just walk away ?
i said i &apos;m her friend , not her gay friend .
listen , i know you said you didn &apos;t want to talk ...
i don &apos;t .
sorry .
wait !
wait ? did you say &quot; wait &quot; ?
tell me the truth .
am i just an idiot who picks giant losers ?
so i pick good guys but turn them into losers .
of course not .
it &apos;s gotta be one or the other. which is it ?
i &apos;m sorry , what were the choices again ?
i really thought mike was different .
i thought he was ...
sensitive and smart ,
i mean , not you smart , normal non @-@ freaky smart .
yeah , no , sure .
and then he just goes and has to humiliate me
by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it .
i tell you , it &apos;s not all that easy to find .
really ? my friends at work found it , my sister found it .
judging by my email , a number of prisoners
at the michigan state penitentiary found it .
what exactly did this guy write ?
not that i need to know the details of your sex life . i just thought ...
never mind .
no , you know what ?
you might as well read it. everybody else has. go ahead .
oh , god , i just feel so betrayed and embarrassed !
i just want to crawl into a hole and die !
okay. well , you know , this isn &apos;t that bad .
it just paints the picture
of a very affectionate woman ,
who &apos;s open to expressing her affection
in non @-@ traditional locales .
oh , god !
elevators , parks ,
movie theaters .
out of curiosity ,
is this &quot; subway &quot; the transportation system
or subway the sandwich shop ?
sandwich shop .
doesn &apos;t that violate the health code ?
no , at the sub shop we were only making out .
but my point is that
you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed .
really ? do you think i overreacted ?
maybe a little .
because i do that . i do overreact .
maybe i should call mike and apologize .
that would be under @-@ reacting .
he did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom .
and in your case , the elevator , parks and fast food franchise .
you &apos;re right . i should just say &quot; i am done with him . &quot;
yes , you should. go ahead , say it .
but i never gave the man a chance to explain .
what is there to explain ?
it &apos;s all right here .
the betrayal !
no , you were right the first time .
this is a man who loves me , but in his own stupid way ,
which is trying to sw w people how he feels .
i &apos;m pretty sure i never said that .
no , you did better than that .
you helped me see it on my own .
oh , good for me .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m going over to mike &apos;s .
leonard , thank you so much .
oh , sure .
huh , maybe i am her gay friend .
howard , i &apos;m going to nd d another mandarin lesson .
i obviously didn &apos;t make
my point with those people .
for god &apos;s sake , sheldon ,
if you don &apos;t like the ngngerine chicken ,
don &apos;t order the tangerine chicken .
i like tangerine chicken ,
i &apos;m just not getting tangerine chicken .
can we please change the subject ?
sure .
ll us again how you screwed up
and got penny back together witherer old boyfriend .
just roll the dice .
&quot; enslaved by warlocks .
stay here until you roll two , four or six . &quot;
she was mad at him !
she was done with him !
e e relationship was broken beyond repair ,
and i walked over there , and i fixed it .
boy , that story gets better every time you hear ..
actually , i thought the first two renditions
were far more compelling .
previously , i felt sympathy for the leonard character ,
now i just find him to be whiny and annoying .
eat your tangerine chicken .
i &apos;d love to , but i don &apos; have tangerine chicken .
thank you so much for your stupid advice !
incredible .
you managed to screw up the screw @-@ up .
i &apos;m back .
i &apos;m sorry i yelled at you .
it &apos;s not your fault .
what happened ?
well , i went over to mike &apos;s to make up with him .
yeah. no , i know that part .
but he had already moved on .
already ? that was quick .
that &apos;s what i said to the woman
who had her legs wrapped around his neck !
oh , penny , i am so sorry .
how could he do that ? !
well , you know , you did throw an 80 @-@ gig ipod ...
yeah , no , how could he do that ?
i swear to god i am done with guys like that .
you know , macho with the perfect body and the hair and the money .
yeah , that must get old quick .
you know , just once
i would like to go out with someone
who is nice and honest and who actually cares about me .
what about me ?
what about you what ?
what about if you went out with me ?
are you asking me out ?
um , yes , i am ...
asking you out .
i was just going off your comment about the nice guy ...
no , i know , i got that. you know , and honest .
yeah , totally .
so , but ... it &apos;s no big deal .
yes .
yes what ?
yes , i will go out with you .
really ?
yeah .
why not ?
i mean , what do i have to lose ?
yeah .
that &apos;s the spirit .
show me your citrus peels .
gay wo k n ni de jud zi pee .
show me your citrus peels .
gay wo kan ni de jud zi pee .
show me your ... sheldon ?
ai yah ! xia si wo le
i &apos;m sorry .
look , do you have a second ?
a second what , pair of underwear ?
i was just wondering if i could talk to you .
it &apos;s about leonard .
why me ?
why not koothrappali or wolowitz ?
well , raj can &apos;t talk to me unless he &apos;s drunk ,
and wolowitz is , you know , disgusting .
yes , i suppose he is
all i &apos;m saying is , you know leordrd the best .
not necessarily .
i &apos;m often surprised
by my lack of familiarity with leonard .
just the other day i discovered
he not only has a loofah ,
he hides it .
why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah ?
i , myself , prefer to have my excess epithelial cells
slough off naturally , but i d &apos;t condemn
those who seek to accelerate the process .
... and until recently i had no idea
that despite his lactose intolerance ,
he can tolerate small amounts of non @-@ fat ice cream
without producing a noxious gas that i maintain ,
in the right concentration , could be weaponize
leonard might come home .
can we talk in my apartment ?
we &apos;re not done ?
no .
eh , why not ?
we &apos;re already through the looking glass anyway .
okay , so here &apos;s the thing ...
i guess you &apos;re aware that leonard asked me out .
well , he didn &apos;t actually say anything ,
but when he came back to the apartment
he was doing a dance that brought to mind
the happy hippos in fantasia .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
anyhow , the thing i wanted to talk to you about
is , you know , since leonard and i have become friends ...
i was just ...
you want to sit down ?
oh , i wish it were that simple .
see , i don &apos;t spend much time here ,
and so i &apos;ve never really chosen a place to sit .
well , choose .
there are a number of options , and ...
i &apos;m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities ,
air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight
to make an informed choice .
all right.why don &apos;t you just pick one at random
and if you don &apos;t like it you can sit somewhere else next time .
no , no. that &apos;s crazy .
you go ahead and talk while i figure it out .
okay .
um , here &apos;s the thing .
so i &apos;ve known for a while now
that leonard has had
a little crush on me ...
a little crush ?
well , i suppose so--in the same way menelaus
had a &quot; little crush &quot; on helen of troy .
all right , yeah , i don &apos;t really know who they are , but ...
well , menelaus was the brother of agamemnon ...
i don &apos;t care . i don &apos;t care. listen .
the point is ,
leonard isn &apos;t the kind of guy i usually go out with .
leonard isn &apos;t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with .
would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees ?
no. what i &apos;m saying is
leonard might be different in a good way .
obviously , my usual choices have not worked out so well .
your last one worked out well for koothrappali .
he got a free ipod .
oh , glare .
on the other hand , if things don &apos;t go well with leonard ,
i risk losing a really good friend .
i mean , i &apos;m guessing he &apos;s not looking for a fling .
he &apos;s the kind of guy that gets into a relationship
for , i don &apos;t know , like you would say , light years .
i would not say that .
no one
would say that .
a light year is a unit of distance not time .
thank you for the clarification .
draft .
see , people hear the word &quot; year &quot;
and they think duration .
&quot; foot @-@ pound &quot; has the same problem--
that &apos;s a unit of work , not of weight .
right. thanks .
it &apos;s common mistake .
not the first one i &apos;ve made today .
okay .
i think this will be my seat .
sheldon , do you have anything to say
that has anything to do with , you know ,
what i &apos;m talking about ?
well , let &apos;s see ...
we might cononsider schrodinger &apos;s cat .
schrodinger ?
is that the woman in 2a ?
no , that &apos;s mrs. grossinger .
and she doesn &apos;t have a cat , she has a mexican hairless .
annoying little animal. yip , yip , yip , yip .
sheldon .
sorry , you diverted me .
anyway , in 1935 , erwin schrodinger ,
in an attempt to explain the copenhagen interpretation
of quantum physics ,
he proposed an experimen
where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison
that will break open at a random time .
now , since no one knows when
or if the poison has been released ,
until the box is opened ,
the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t get the point .
wellofof course you don &apos;t get it ; i haven &apos;t made it yet .
you &apos;d have to be psychic to get it ,
and there &apos;s no such thing as &quot; psychic . &quot;
sheldon , what &apos;s the point ? !
just like schrodinger &apos;s cat ,
your potential relationship with leonard right now
can be thought of as both good andadad .
it is only by opening the box
that you &apos;ll find out which it is .
okay , so you &apos;re saying i should go out with leonard .
no , no , no , no , no .
let me start again .
in 1935 , erwin schrodinger ...
two seats right there .
社会主义万岁
shay shay .
sheldon , i think i &apos;ve made a mistake .
i can seththat .
unless you &apos;re planning on running a marathon ,
choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes
is a starch @-@ filled redundancy .
no , it &apos;s about penny .
a mistake involving penny .
okay , you &apos;ll have to narrow it down .
i don &apos;t think i can go out with her tonight .
then don &apos;t .
other pelele would say &quot; why not ? &quot;
other people might be interested .
i &apos;m going to talk anyway .
i assumed you would .
now that i &apos;m actually about to go out with penny ,
i &apos;m not excited--i &apos;m nauseous .
ah , then your meal choice is appropriate .
starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit
available for violent expulsion .
right. you also made
a common grammatical mistake .
you said &quot; nauseous , &quot; when you meant &quot; nauseated . &quot;
but go on .
sheldon , this date is probably my one chance with penny .
what happens if i blow it ?
well , if we accept your premise
and also accept the highly improbable assumption
that penny is the only woman in the world for you ,
then we can logically conclude that the result
of blowing it would be that you end up
a lonely , bitter old man with no progeny .
the image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers
from scooby @-@ doo cartoons comes to mind .
you &apos;re not helping .
all right , what respon on my part
would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion ?
tell me whether or not to go through with the date .
scododinger &apos;s cat .
wow , that &apos;s brilliant .
you sound surprised .
好滋味在里头 ..
hi .
hi .
come on in .
thank you .
you look very nice .
thank you. so do you .
i made an 8 : 00 reservation .
okay , yeah , great .
listen , um ...
maybe we should talk first .
okay .
but before you say anything ,
have you ever heard of schrodinger &apos;s cat ?
actually , i &apos;ve heard far too much about schrodinger &apos;s cat .
good .
all right , the cat &apos;s alive .
l &apos;s go to dinner .
