with deluca ? me ?
no . you thought that ?
yeah . i mean , you were very --
no ! no . he broke -- we broke --
it ended .
okay .
yeah , a while ago .
okay .
it was just too hard , you know , with us working together --
yeah , well , i get that .
not that it couldn &apos;t work at work with work people .
i think it can .
it could with the right work people .
oh , god .
it &apos;s maggie . i &apos;m here .
has he been conscious ?
he was on intake , but we had to tube him .
what &apos;s it look like ?
his head ct &apos;s clear , but he does have an eight @-@ ball hyphema .
who did this ?
we don &apos;t know .
karev brought him in ,
but we haven &apos;t heard what happened yet .
actually , we should find out who we need to call .
i &apos;m gonna go grab his personnel file .
his mother . she &apos;s probably at work .
i &apos;ll call her . she knows me .
how is he ? is there a brain injury ?
he just got out of ct .
did you see his scan ?
well , no , but the radiologist said they &apos;re clear .
will you look ? will you look at it yourself ?
alex , they said --
what if they missed something ? what if --
what if he has a delayed bleed
and he drops dead tomorrow ?
i will . i will look at the scans .
alex , this is really bad .
it &apos;s bad . i know . i know .
i just --
i @-@ i went crazy .
i just -- i --
what if i talk to deluca ,
just , you know , before he says anything .
maybe you should talk to the police .
no , no , no . can we wait until we find out how bad it is ?
you know , just --
go -- go check his scans , please .
i will go check the scans .
hey , um , have you talked to the police yet ?
uh , yeah . uh , no . - i mean -- uh why ?
miranda said you should come see her .
how &apos;s the hand ?
what ?
it looked like it was giving you trouble earlier .
oh . i slipped in the rain .
look , man , uh ,
deluca &apos;s gonna clear everything up when he gets out of surgery , so
is there anything
there isn &apos;t .
okay .
you know , i got the guy here . i helped him , okay ?
this eye &apos;s a big problem . his pressure is getting out of control
we need to get him to an o.r.with an ophthalmologist right away
could he lose his eyesight ?
the thing is , the eye &apos;s paralyzed .
it &apos;s trapped in the fractured socket .
we get in there , we free it , then we drain the blood .
i &apos;ve got a call into jan reger .
she &apos;s great , but she &apos;s in whidbey island , so --
you can &apos;t do it ?
uh , technically , yes , i -- i could --
then why are we waiting for jan reger ?
she &apos;s an ophthalmologist . i &apos;d rather have
it &apos;s his eyesight .
it &apos;s his career , jackson . let &apos;s not wait .
she &apos;s right . avery , if you can do it , do it .
i &apos;ll do it .
how &apos;s kepner doing ?
she &apos;s good .
she &apos;s , uh , sleeping .
what -- what are you doing ?
hey . shhh . i &apos;m here , i &apos;m here .
oh , she was just fussing a little bit ,
so i- thought you could use the sleep ,
and i just swooped her up .
we are bonding .
somebody &apos;s just fascinated with their grandma .
riveted . yeah .
how are you feeling ?
i &apos;m okay . hurt .
oh , no doubt .
april , i can &apos;t believe what you went through .
it was worth it .
she &apos;s beautiful . she &apos;s just absolutely beautiful .
i just wish i knew what to call her .
jackson didn &apos;t tell you ?
no , i just got here .
he &apos;d probably want to be here to tell you .
we don &apos;t have to wait for him .
well , uh ...
we wanted something strong , memorable ...
is it catherine ?
are you little catherine ?
we thought there could only be one catherine .
her name is harriet .
harriet .
oh . i like it .
tubman .
exactly . tubman .
also &quot; the spy . &quot;
which is a very good book .
i love it .
harriet avery .
it &apos;s beautiful . it just flows .
i &apos;m sorry , who said her name was avery ?
are those andrew &apos;s head cts ?
i thought they were clean .
yeah , i &apos;m just double @-@ checking .
i want to make sure we didn &apos;t miss anything .
they look good .
thanks .
god .
what do you think happened ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe a mugging or something .
i just got off the phone with his parents .
and apparently , he neglected to tell them that we had broken up .
oh , god .
mer , was i really crappy to him ?
deluca ? he broke up with you .
he &apos;s a good , good guy .
am i being stupid ?
chasing after riggs , when deluca was right there ?
i mean , am i being stupid ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
i was gonna talk to riggs tonight .
at the wedding , while we were dancing , i was gonna say ,
&quot; hey , how about you and me ? &quot;
and then richard webber jock @-@ blocked me .
of course .
and now riggs thinks i &apos;m in love with deluca .
i swear , maybe this is just --
what are you doing in scrubs ?
i thought i &apos;m going in on avery .
yeah . i &apos;m going in . not to operate .
just ...
i don &apos;t know .
to hold his hand .
i guess so .
yeah.- yeah
it &apos;s stupid .
it &apos;s not at all .
he &apos;s a good guy . nothing wrong with that .
i know , but i &apos;m not -- i don &apos;t --
come on , he &apos;s gorgeous . you can &apos;t do much better .
good luck . i hope it works out .
okay .
thanks .
you all right , then ?
thank you for bringing maggie .
i said &quot; are you all right ? &quot;
i &apos;m fine .
but you don &apos;t need to do that . you don &apos;t need to check on me .
what ? i &apos;m a nice guy . i &apos;m being nice .
it &apos;s what i do .
you were very nice .
you did a nice thing for maggie .
but now you &apos;re ruining it .
you okay ?
listen , alex , it wasn &apos;t --
you were drunk .
it wasn &apos;t your fault , i know .
what are you talking about ?
deluca .
he pushed himself on you , right ?
you were drunk and he tried to take advantage of you --
no . no , no , no , no .
alex . i -- i was drunk , yes ,
because i was upset you had left .
you were upset about us ? about me ?
yes , of course !
so this is what you do ?
you bring this guy back to our place to screw ?
if you would just let me talk to you --
&apos;cause you were upset .
just listen to me !
you know what ? forget it .
it &apos;s like i said ,
you can &apos;t help it , it &apos;s not your fault .
it &apos;s easy for you to throw people away ,
to just move on when things are bad .
it &apos;s not you . it &apos;s the way you were raised --
or not raised .
i wanted to marry you .
i was asking you for something you &apos;re not capable of .
i should have known better .
okay .
so , first , the muscle of his eye is trapped here
in the bone fracture , so i &apos;m just gonna pop it out .
there we go . all right .
micro scalpel , please ?
will he see again ?
we &apos;ll see .
once i am able to flush the blood out of there ,
his intraocular pressure should come down
and his vision should return .
but don &apos;t worry .
his eyes should be just as pretty as ever .
will everyone stop doing that ?
i want his eyes to work because they &apos;re his eyes .
sorry . you &apos;re right .
and he &apos;s a surgeon . he can &apos;t be one with one eye .
okay ?
it doesn &apos;t mean that i love him or i miss him or i &apos;m pining .
he &apos;s a friend .
no , he &apos;s not a friend because the breakup was a train wreck ,
and he probably hates me , but he is a person ,
or was a person , that i was personal with .
i mean , you had feelings .
you had huge feelings ,
and you can &apos;t be expected just to turn those feelings off like some robot .
especially if you &apos;ve been through something horrible together .
i get it .
yeah , you do .
try having a baby with him .
that &apos;s okay . i &apos;m good .
hello . how we doing ?
good . almost done here .
how is he ?
he &apos;s got a grade four hyphema .
dr. avery &apos;s trying to drain it now ...
but ... ?
i &apos;d be worried about rebleeds , long @-@ term vision loss .
which would mean ...
whoever did this just ended his career as a surgeon .
you know , i , um ...
i think i know who it is .
why haven &apos;t you said anything ?
i &apos;m not sure , um ...
i --i think because i can guess what he did .
he reacted .
in a split second , in the moment ,
and a horrible thing happened .
i know what that &apos;s like .
what about you ? it is just blind loyalty ?
it &apos;s not blind .
he &apos;s earned it .
when i first got here ,
he was one of the worst people i had ever met in my life .
and now he &apos;s one of the best .
and i know both of those people are still in there .
i just want to make sure the right one wins .
well , anyway , i --
i don &apos;t think it should come from me .
me , either .
okay . there you are .
what are you doing here ?
webber called me .
he said he thought you might be with me .
he said deluca got beat up , and then you ran off .
look , i &apos;m here &apos; cause i &apos;m your friend , dummy .
what happened ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m leaving .
okay , fine . i &apos;ll drive you .
no , i &apos;m leaving , leaving .
you &apos;re quitting ?
yeah .
you &apos;re quitting the program .
and you &apos;re not gonna tell me what this is ?
i can &apos;t .
you -- okay , hey . what the hell ? jo .
what happened with deluca ?
you can talk to me .
i &apos;m the one that left you at the bar with him . what ?
she was really upset about karev .
she was also really drunk .
so you left her with deluca ?
to keep her safe , yes .
i didn &apos;t want to leave her there alone .
so he made sure she got home okay ,
and you have to understand --
i do . she wanted to hurt alex back .
but she may have hurt him for good this time .
i mean , this could end his career .
i mean , this goes well beyond just sleeping with another guy .
she didn &apos;t sleep with deluca .
did he force himself on her ?
no , he
he kept her safe !
he got her home . he made sure she was okay .
deluca was kind and nice and thoughtful , and --
deluca was trying to keep her from getting hurt
or from hurting herself , and then you walked in .
okay , how do you know edwards isn &apos;t lying about the whole thing ?
because i wanted her to be , which is awful .
but i was hoping for some reason
that you beat that man half to death
that doesn &apos;t make you a monster .
you know she wasn &apos;t lying .
is deluca out of surgery ? did he wake up ?
you have to go to bailey and say something .
if he presses charges ...
he should press charges .
he &apos;s not the bad guy here , and jo isn &apos;t the bad guy .
we &apos;re the bad guys -- really bad guys .
if i don &apos;t say something ... if you don &apos;t say something ...
i want to run .
you can &apos;t run .
i thought i grew up .
i just said this to jo yesterday .
i went back there t @-@ t @-@ to talk to her , to make things right ,
to do the grown @-@ up thing .
alex ...
let me talk to deluca . just let me try , okay ?
wilson !
did you hear what happened ?
not yet .
but i know it &apos;s not worth leaving here .
i made a mess .
i can &apos;t fix it . i can only make it worse .
so i am walking away from it .
it &apos;s better for everyone , okay ?
just --
move . please .
no .
i don &apos;t know what happened ,
but whatever it is ,
you won &apos;t get it fixed by running from it .
and you won &apos;t gain anything by quitting .
we don &apos;t quit .
i won &apos;t let you .
now , you ditched me once today .
i &apos;m not gonna let it happen again .
i mean , she &apos;s your baby .
you can call her whatever you want .
just as long as it &apos;s &quot; avery . &quot;
i &apos;ll say this .
avery wasn &apos;t my name , either .
but i took it on - and i built it into something .
and the name that i built will open doors for this little girl .
i &apos;m just thinking of her future .
yeah , well , the name kepner means something , too .
what ?
where i come from , it means good people ,
a tireless work ethic ,
a fair and honest price for quality pork ,
the people you call when you &apos;re in trouble .
yeah , it may not open doors , but kepner means something .
now , can i have my -- aah !
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s all right . i &apos;ve got her .
no , catherine , i can hold my own baby .
no , april , you can &apos;t .
no , you can &apos;t .
you nearly died bringing her into this world .
you did something superhuman .
so now you get to rest and heal .
harriet &apos;s just fine .
she &apos;s got her grandma ,
and that &apos;s what grandmas are for .
so now just relax .
sleep for an hour .
you &apos;re gonna have - her whole life to hold her .
rest and heal .
she &apos;s gonna need you .
couldn &apos;t you hyphenate ?
avery @-@ kepner ?
we are hyphenating , mom .
that &apos;s what we decided , right ?
yes . kepner @-@ avery .
well , why didn &apos;t you say that ?
because she &apos;s my baby .
that &apos;s your baby .
she is my baby .
dr. leo , call the pharmacy .

i asked you what happened , and you lied .
alex and i were trying to -- - trying to what ?
trying to figure out a way to justify the beating
he gave to andrew ? what ?
i don &apos;t know .
i poured my heart out to you all day .
and you knew this .
it wasn &apos;t about you , maggie .
i am your sister .
i know .
do you ?
&apos;cause it means something different to me .
you encouraged me to stay .
you offered me a home and a family .
and i accepted . and i wasn &apos;t kidding .
i will go down swinging for you .
it means something to me .
i thought i could trust you .
you can .
from here on out .
don &apos;t do it again .
don &apos;t lie to me again .
okay .
okay .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m gonna get that .
oh , god . what are you doing here ?
i want to know what the problem is .
what ?
at the wedding , you said we had a problem .
i want to know what the problem is .
the problem is you showing up here , looking for --
what are you looking for ?
i &apos;m not looking for anything . it &apos;s right here .
meredith . hey ! listen .
there &apos;s something happening here .
we both know it .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
someone is going to get hurt .
i can handle it .
not you .
from what i can see , you seem indestructible .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
tell me .
the problem is ...
you &apos;re wrong .
i don &apos;t feel the same way .
so let &apos;s just drop it , okay ?
good night .
best to keep the past in the past .
move on . learn from it .
who was that ?
oh . that was no one .
it was just someone looking for directions .
where are you going ?
if we don &apos;t learn from our mistakes ...
... we wind up locked into a future we &apos;d never choose .
it was nice knowing you .
shut up .
what ?
you think i &apos;m keeping my job or my medical license ?
we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
i &apos;ll tell you what isn &apos;t gonna happen .
me ever setting foot in that hospital again .
sorry .
why ?
you didn &apos;t punch the guy .
but i told bailey .
you did ?
yes . i had to .
i know .
it &apos;s better . you did the right thing .
mm . right now , being the guy who got beat up would feel better .
you said it yourself . we &apos;re grown @-@ ups .
we can &apos;t run .
we have to face up to the stupid things we do .
supposedly , if you face up to them ,
something good comes out of it .
i don &apos;t know what , but ...
15 to 20 , probably .
i &apos;m sorry .
shut up .
the past is written .
there &apos;s no changing it .
what &apos;s done is done .
but the future is ours to choose .
for better or worse .
