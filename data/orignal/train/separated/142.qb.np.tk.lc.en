we &apos;re headed to court now .
dad is taking the plea agreement .
the donors !
grace .
i want them to hear it from the governor himself .
there &apos;s going to be a two week delay .
wait , this is the right thing to do .
two years .
that &apos;s the lowest we could get .
no , it was before the verdict came in . why ?
hold on .
diane thinks we &apos;d better get on with the ausa ,
make sure he &apos;s still holding to the plea deal .
why ?
wait . g @-@ grace , hold on .
has she heard something ?
no , but she worries about the verdict coming in so fast .
that &apos;s usually pro @-@ prosecution .
grace , i &apos;m going to have to call you back .
i knew he &apos;d find some way to screw us .
we agreed ,
peter would take a two years plea .
that &apos;s a sitting governor ,
agreeing to a two year prison sentence .
the jury was out one hour .
you and i both know that means a guilty verdict .
no . we don &apos;t know anything .
we know i &apos;m not the one running scared to you .
i want four years .
no .
my client would rather roll the dice .
your client is risking ten years in prison with a guilty verdict .
ten years ...
away from his kids ,
away from you .
why don &apos;t you ask the blagojevich family
因倒卖伊利诺伊州参议员职位被判处十四年刑期
how well they &apos;re holding up ?
you think you can play the emotional card with me ?
you think i &apos;m going to break down and cry ?
look at me .
do i look like i &apos;m breaking down ?
three years .
no .
but here &apos;s what we &apos;ll give you .
an immediate surrender .
today . within the hour .
peter surrenders in court .
no press conference .
no talk about how you smeared his family .
you get the press cycle all to yourself ,
and that &apos;s the best i &apos;ll offer .
but , dad , you have to fight this .
i can &apos;t risk being away from you until you &apos;re 30 .
it &apos;s two years .
i &apos;m going to be at your graduation , in the front row .
i promise .
i can &apos;t go to college now .
grace . you will go .
you have to make us proud .
you have to make your mom forget this .
okay ?
okay .
now i got to go comfort eli .
thank you .
what for ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
you stuck by me through the presidential .
i made a mistake there with you ,
and i &apos;m sorry for that .
all rise . the honorable judge
richard cuesta presiding .
so i understand we have a plea deal .
we do , your honor .
governor florrick , you are accused of bribery ,
obstruction of justice ,
and wire fraud , in the matter of the murder trial
of patty tanniston .
now , in accepting this plea ,
you acknowledge willfully arranging the mistrial
of her accused murderer , richard locke ,
in exchange for the political contributions of his father .
and , uh , you ... um ...
your honor ?
before turning to your plea , there is another matter .
the jury has not yet reached a verdict .
but they do have a question .
what does that mean ?
your honor , the jury &apos;s question
is no longer relevant given our plea arrangement .
actually , the plea has not been entered yet .
well , we were in the midst of entering it , so ...
yes , but it appears that the
defendant is rejecting the plea deal . is that correct ?
it is , your honor .
okay .
well , then let &apos;s listen to the question that the jury has .
i mean , i &apos;m excited about this .
thank you .
from the jury : &quot; we have read
the transcripts of the victim &apos;s 911 call ,
but we would like to hear the call itself . &quot;
is that possible ?
your honor , sidebar , please ?
let &apos;s go .
why is that good ?
because they &apos;re focusing on the murder
and not dad &apos;s guilt .
and we want that ?
&apos;cause we want ... want to distract them ?
but that doesn &apos;t mean dad is guilty .
i know . you don &apos;t have to sugarcoat it .
i need your help .
look , stop playing coy and get in here and help .
i thought the verdict was coming down .
no , the jury has a question .
this is not over .
911 . where &apos;s the emergency ?
hi , yeah , i think somebody &apos;s trying to break in .
where are you , ma &apos;am ?
865 heylan avenue .
there are some noises outside my window .
heylan avenue . and what are you hearing , ma &apos;am ?
i think somebody &apos;s trying to get in .
i heard the locks being turned .
my boyfriend was supposed to be back , but he called ...
are you someplace safe , ma &apos;am ?
have you set all your locks ?
yes , but just ... there it is again .
are you there , ma &apos;am ?
someone &apos;s trying to get in . wait , one second .
ma &apos;am .
are you there , ma &apos;am ? ma &apos;am ?
yeah , i just ...
i &apos;m here . hold on .
are you sending someone ?
yes , ma &apos;am . just stay on the phone .
wait ! no ! no !
and there you have it .
the 911 call .
tad , if you would escort them back to the jury room , please .
uh , excuse me , is there something else ?
yes . i &apos;m sorry , your honor .
we do have one more question .
yes .
at the 48 second mark ,
in the transcript , there &apos;s a sound listed as &quot; inaudible noise . &quot;
what is it ?
your honor .
sidebar , your honor .
ma &apos;am ?
yeah , i just ...
ma &apos;am ?
yeah , i just ...
ma &apos;am ?
yeah , i just ...
is that the sound at 48 seconds ?
ma &apos;am ?
yeah , i just ...
what is it ?
how are you going to find out ?
what are you doing ?
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a ringtone .
it &apos;s a freaking ringtone .
someone else &apos;s .
how do you know ?
she was using her cell to call 911 .
your honor , they want to re @-@ open this case .
it was argued . we had closing arguments .
we are merely trying to satisfy the jury &apos;s questions .
no , you &apos;re not , diane . don &apos;t play innocent .
you &apos;re trying to shout down the other evidence
with this melodrama .
exactly .
we &apos;re not the ones asking the question , your honor .
the jury is . they obviously have some probative value .
well , first of all , do we even know what this
&quot; inaudible noise &quot; was ?
we do .
okay . then this is what i want .
bring me legal arguments tomorrow morning
as to whether the jury should hear this evidence ,
and the jury will delay their deliberations until then .
no .
it &apos;s a ringtone .
how did you find that out ?
i didn &apos;t . jason did .
i thought jason wasn &apos;t working on this .
he wasn &apos;t . i asked him to .
he thinks we could imply someone else was there .
well , it will keep the jury occupied .
they seem to want to chase the murder .
question is , will cuesta let it in .
diane , my second year ...
we argued something similar to this ... a bribery case ?
do you have the research ? i could probably find it .
it was 2010 . something with sweeney .
do we have it online ?
the briefs , not the notes .
you may want to check the file cabinets .
looks like an all @-@ nighter digging up precedents ,
so let &apos;s get started .
you should probably thank jason .
i will .
you should probably thank him now .
i will , lucca .
what &apos;s going on ?
jason thinks that if peter goes to prison ,
you &apos;ll never divorce him .
what ?
jason just thinks ...
no , i heard what you said , i ...
what does that even mean ?
it means ,
you don &apos;t want to kick a man when he &apos;s down .
okay , and by man , are we meaning jason ?
no . peter .
you tend to confuse responsibility and love .
i ...
is jason saying all this ?
some of it . i added a few bits .
just think about it .
who do you want to come home to ?
every night .
who do you want to see when you open your door ?
lucca , it &apos;s not up to me .
jason wants his freedom .
talk to him .
what will that do ?
talk to him .
my god .
stupid .
不得靠近 楼梯危险
i can &apos;t read that .
what &apos;s that say ?
it says u.s. v. nunez .
oh . of course . u.s. v nunez . how could i forget ?
it &apos;s the st. jude of precedents .
lost causes .
you &apos;ve had your closing argument ,
the judge instructs the jury ,
you think it &apos;s over , right ?
but it &apos;s not .
nothing &apos;s ever over . remember that .
nothing .
a case may be reopened when the party so moving
provides a reasonable explanation for failure
to present the evidence in its case @-@ in ... chief .
you remembered all that ?
hey , i was
the one awake in criminal procedure .
i was awake .
no , you were not .
you were always ... drunk ,
lolling around .
that is so not true .
and i &apos;ve never lolled in my life .
okay . tell me the name of our professor .
oh , come on , you don &apos;t remember his name .
i do . professor stone .
what ?
nothing .
it &apos;s just really good to see you again .
again ?
where was i ?
you wouldn &apos;t like it here now .
things have gotten sad .
hmm , things were pretty sad when i was here .
no . they were never sad .
us hating each other ?
did you really hate me ?
oh , yeah .
so what do i do ?
i told you .
u.s. v. nunez .
no .
in life .
oh , that .
i don &apos;t know . i was never very good at that .
yes , you were .
you always made it look so easy .
why didn &apos;t i come to you ?
what did you say ?
&quot; it was romantic because it didn &apos;t happen .
so you got a little bit of both . &quot;
life . us together .
and now romance .
hey . do you have a minute ?
sorry . are you all right ?
yeah . i &apos;m just , uh , studying precedents .
what &apos;s up ?
i need you to talk with cary .
why ?
matan won &apos;t help and i need access
to the prosecutor &apos;s work .
cary won &apos;t help me .
i &apos;m the last person he &apos;d help .
i disagree .
u.s. v. nunez . good .
smart . and i got david boies to argue for us .
it &apos;ll impress the hell out of cuesta .
so , where are we on evidence ?
we &apos;re trying to find the owner of the cell phone .
we need a few more hours .
i only have one witness .
can you stretch it ?
david boies .
chairman of the firm , boies , schiller &amp; flexner .
sir , you are one of the most respected
legal experts working today , is that correct ?
i &apos;d rather not say that about myself .
and , uh ,
you are here as an expert on u.s. v. nunez ?
i am .
but first , um ,
tell us a little about yourself .
let &apos;s start with your childhood .
your honor ,
uh ... relevance ?
oh , i think the relevance ...
will become clear .
i &apos;ll give you a little leeway .
where were you born , mr. boies ?
things are looking up in court ?
a bit .
knock on wood .
i &apos;m just trying to stay away ,
and focus on my core constituents .
which is why i wanted to meet with you , dwight .
i &apos;m not here , peter .
i &apos;m just waiting on my wife who &apos;s shopping .
yes , i know .
but you &apos;ve given a lot of money to my campaigns over the years ,
and i wanted to tell you first ...
this isn &apos;t over .
i know .
eli told me .
good . because there are a lot of paths to the future .
i know . alicia .
excuse me ?
eli said we move our investments to alicia .
wha ... to ...
wha ... what did eli say ?
alicia divorces you ,
she runs for office ,
we invest in her .
it &apos;s good .
especially when you look at her approval ratings .
i didn &apos;t know he was teaching .
guest lecturer .
he looks like he &apos;s been doing this his whole life .
it &apos;s nice when people find their purpose .
thank you for helping with peter .
that &apos;s what i do .
lucca thinks ...
what does lucca think ?
lucca thinks we should talk .
about ?
us .
god .
i don &apos;t know .
my head hurts every time i try to figure out
what it is you want and what i want
and how those two things may coincide .
no . look ...
your husband needs you .
i think sometimes you need to be needed .
it keeps you from tipping over .
i j ...
wait for me .
okay ?
just wait .
talk to matan .
matan won &apos;t help .
why did they not do a full search
of the evidence room for the missing bullets ?
peter wouldn &apos;t sign off on it .
no . after he left .
what would be the point ?
the bullets were gone .
there &apos;s a metal detector right outside the evidence room .
i can &apos;t be the first person to have noticed that .
the missing bullets ... are still in there somewhere .
why did no one ever look after the mistrial ?
what would be the point ?
the truth . cary , you always talk about the truth .
oh , come on . your husband caused that mistrial .
that &apos;s the truth . seriously .
so don &apos;t pretend like you actually care
about what really happened .
well , if peter did it , he did it .
i want to know what happened either way .
a total search of the evidence room is a dead end .
it would take too long .
there &apos;s something else .
there was a cell phone ringing on the patty tanniston 911 call .
we need your help , cary .
who could &apos;ve been there with patty ?
and that &apos;s when you represented george steinbrenner
in the suit against major league baseball ?
yes , that &apos;s correct .
could you expand , uh , upon those thoughts ?
which thoughts ?
uh , well , the thoughts about , you know ,
what we were just talking about .
your honor .
seriously ?
is that an objection ?
yes . relevance .
excuse me .
withdrawn .
mr. boies , actually , one quick question .
do you think u.s. v. nunez applies here ?
yes , i do . i think ...
thank you , sir .
no further questions .
no rebuttal .
i &apos;m not sure what i would rebut anyway .
thank you , mr. boies-- that was an unadulterated pleasure .
that &apos;s it ?
yes . thank you .
okay .
that was interesting .
your honor ,
we have a witness here
whose cell phone was heard
on the 911 tape .
seriously ?
would you like to hear from her , your honor ?
yes , i would .
your honor , sidebar , please ?
i expected nothing less . let &apos;s go .
what happened ?
what do you mean ?
you &apos;re supposed to be on your way to berkeley .
no , i &apos;m staying .
grace ...
you &apos;re going to college .
this isn &apos;t open for debate .
no , i already called them .
i &apos;m just delaying for one year .
oh , my god , grace , you can &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m not going to the west coast
while dad &apos;s in trouble . you wouldn &apos;t do it--
i &apos;m not gonna do it , either .
this isn &apos;t about me .
this is about your future .
right .
and i get to decide my future .
so you were
in patty tanniston &apos;s apartment .
that was your cell phone ringing ?
yeah . but i left as soon as it rang .
but there were only seconds
between your cell phone ringing
and the gunshots that killed patty tanniston .
not seconds .
yes , it was .
exactly 23 seconds .
can we hear the 911 tape again ?
your honor , please , the defense is throwing
every insane theory against the wall to see what sticks .
no . the police and prosecution never pursued this witness ,
because they were obsessed with locke .
but what does that matter ?
we are not trying to solve a murder .
this is not murder on the orient express .
yes , i love mysteries
as much as the next person ,
but this is confined .
did a politician do something corrupt ?
your honor ,
if i may be allowed to con ...
no . hold on .
what did george orwell say ?
&quot; to see what is in front of your nose
needs a constant struggle . &quot;
you &apos;re right , of course ,
ausa fox .
we &apos;ve heard enough here .
the jury will be asked
to continue their deliberations
without this testimony .
your honor ...
no , i have made my ruling .
do you see what &apos;s going on in court ?
yeah . so ?
do you think we missed something ?
no .
you think the bullets are still in the evidence room ?
probably .
remember how cops talked about pitting evidence ?
why you bringing that up ?
i &apos;m not wearing a wire , matan .
i &apos;m just saying that cops used to talk about pitting evidence .
they &apos;d &quot; accidentally &quot; drop the evidence in a case just closed .
with our bullets , that would narrow down the search
to a few hundred cases , wouldn &apos;t it ?
one year .
probation ?
no .
one year real jail time .
no .
you know , i met you some years ago .
at the equal justice conference in 2008 .
do you remember ?
no .
your husband was giving a speech .
this was before ... everything .
you were fun .
we , uh ... we @-@ we talked about our kids .
you , uh ... you made a joke
about the terrible twos
and how they weren &apos;t as bad as the freakin &apos; fours .
that was a long time ago .
yeah . not many laughs now .
really ?
i don &apos;t make you laugh now ?
the wife of someone you &apos;re prosecuting
for corruption doesn &apos;t amuse you ?
okay . thank you .
hey , here &apos;s a thought .
you give my husband one year probation , no jail time ,
and i &apos;ll work up a demure smile for you .
how &apos;s this ?
good @-@ bye , mrs. florrick .
well , just tell them it &apos;s over .
i got to go .
it &apos;s weird having you across the street here .
yeah , well , diane thought it would be a good idea .
judge cuesta doesn &apos;t like me .
i think it might be working .
it &apos;s going well .
what are you doing , eli ?
what am i doing ? i &apos;m ... making sure you &apos;re all right .
telling my donors to give up on me ?
excuse me ?
i talked to dwight .
he said you &apos;ve been urging the donors
to move their interest to alicia .
he looked at me like i was a dead man ,
like i didn &apos;t exist .
do not patronize me .
i am still the governor of this state .
okay , i won &apos;t .
this is a smart move .
what is ?
screwing me over ?
no , moving political assets over to alicia .
even if you retain your office , you are injured .
the donors can &apos;t stick with you .
they can &apos;t be seen within a mile of you .
because you &apos;re telling them not to .
it &apos;s a self @-@ fulfilling prophecy .
no , it is not , peter . now , we don &apos;t want their money to go
to rahm or stratton or white .
we have to give them someone .
alicia ?
yes .
if i &apos;m so tainted ,
why am i not tainting her ?
because she will divorce you .
and it will be seen as a move of independence .
does alicia know ?
not yet .
it &apos;s the smart move , peter .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah .
hi , alicia .
what ?
that &apos;s great news . i &apos;ll see you soon .
they found the bullets .
they were discovered by prosecutor , matan brody , in another
evidence box , your honor . they were accidentally misplaced .
this is so convenient .
it does seem oddly timed . i mean ,
five years have gone by and they haven &apos;t checked once ?
they had no reason to search thoroughly .
this trial changed their mind .
we &apos;re having the bullets
tested now , your honor .
and you think
the results should be given to the jury ?
it supports the defense &apos;s contention
that peter had no reason to hide them .
when is this over , your honor ? i mean ,
at a certain point , the jury has to work
with the information given them .
i don &apos;t know . this is a very unusual case .
it is , your honor , and we ask that ...
we had the bullet test expedited , your honor .
these should be the results now .
where are you ? your office is crazy .
yes , we have an office space crisis .
thanks for rushing the results , kurt . what did you find ?
it &apos;s definitive .
good . we &apos;ll need you to testify .
i &apos;m not sure you &apos;ll want that .
why ?
the bullets came from locke &apos;s gun . he did it .
you &apos;re sure ?
yes .
florrick had reason to hide &apos; em .
okay , so we back down on our motion
without seeming to back down .
it doesn &apos;t mean that he &apos;s guilty .
i don &apos;t know
if i care anymore .
he &apos;s your client .
that &apos;s why you care .
was that the ballistics ?
uh , no . i , um ...
not yet .
so i imagine
you &apos;re still using u.s. v. nunez as precedent ?
i , um ...
your honor ?
‭ as to why the bullet testing should be given to the jury .
yes , your honor .
the jury had partial evidence .
now they will have full evidence .
how are we expecting them to decide
when they &apos;re missing the most essential piece of our case ?
the bullet evidence .
they jury must have access to the ... what ?
... best available evidence .
but they have the full evidence now .
the evidence isn &apos;t the testing .
the evidence is governor florrick &apos;s state of mind .
ms. lockhart ?
yes ?
your argument .
well , we stand by our original contention .
which was ?
what we originally said .
all relevant evidence is what we want .
okay .
strong argument .
what the hell was that ?
the bullets worked against us .
oh , damn .
i heard about the ballistics test .
just so you know ,
i didn &apos;t do it .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
the jury &apos;s deliberating anyway .
it matters to me .
should i take the year ?
i don &apos;t know .
i did eight months and that was hard .
but a whole year .
grace says she is going to drop out of college
to visit you in prison
what ?
i know . we &apos;re talking .
court &apos;s back in session .
the original ballistic test on these spent bullets
was a pyrolysis gas chromatography .
and this was the test performed by kurt mcveigh ,
the expert hired by the sa &apos;s office ?
yes .
and what test did you perform ?
an elemental composition test .
he would &apos;ve performed it , too ,
if the bullets hadn &apos;t been lost .
and did you perform this test today ?
i did .
and what did you find ?
hey , this is not good .
the bullets definitely came from richard locke &apos;s gun .
your honor ,
i would agree with the defense .
i think the jury should have this evidence
to aid in their deliberations .
we have to get kurt to testify .
no , he won &apos;t help us .
if these results get to the jury ,
they will find against peter .
hello , ms. lockhart .
do we have any questions for this witness ?
not at this time , your honor .
we do have one other witness , your honor .
we call kurt mcveigh .
i had nothing to do with him testifying !
he &apos;s your husband , do you know what that looks like ?
the jury didn &apos;t hear it .
but they will hear it .
cuesta believed him . he believed both of them .
can we just talk about ...
then we argue about not entering that evidence .
or we undercut his testimony .
we have nothing to undercut him with .
there &apos;s a better way ...
he reversed himself !
he reversed his testimony .
no .
he only reversed himself
because i convinced him to testify in the first place .
so ? we can still use it .
we can still use the reversed testimony .
no !
because he &apos;s your husband ?
no .
because he &apos;s honest .
he can &apos;t be undercut .
diane , you have a client .
my husband .
you have a duty to zealously represent that client .
and i am .
i am , but to besmirch this witness would backfire on us .
i am not saying this because he is my husband ,
i am saying this because it is strategically a mistake .
i disagree .
then have peter fire me .
i need your help .
with what ?
cross @-@ examination .
any questions , ms. lockhart ?
no , your honor .
yes , just a few .
mr. mcveigh ,
this is a change in your attitude ,
this new ballistic test .
no , not a change .
a , uh ... it &apos;s a more refined test .
but you testified during the trial
that your ballistic test leaned toward the bullets
not belonging to richard locke &apos;s gun .
yes , i did .
and now you have a different opinion .
not a different opinion ,
a further scientific analysis .
you &apos;re retired , aren &apos;t you , mr. mcveigh ?
yes , i retired this month .
and yet you did this ballistic test
just a few hours ago ?
yes , i did . as a favor .
and you checked your findings with the prosecutor &apos;s
ballistics expert , holly westfall ?
i did .
why did you do that ?
i wanted to see if she had the same result .
is this standard operating procedure ?
no .
why did you do it , then ?
this was an unusual case .
and we had a differing opinion in 2012 .
and isn &apos;t it true that you &apos;ve given her your business ?
i &apos;ve sold her my business . that &apos;s true .
and isn &apos;t it true
that you have had an affair with holly westfall ?
objection , your honor .
for the life of me , i can &apos;t figure out the relevance here .
the relevance is that mr. mcveigh has changed
his testimony to align with the prosecutor &apos;s expert .
bias from an affair is completely relevant .
this is more melodrama , your honor .
the defense is having trouble sticking to the facts .
again , i am a jury of one here .
i will allow some leeway in questioning
then rule on the relevance for the jury .
you may proceed .
isn &apos;t it true , mr. mcveigh ,
that you have had an affair with holly westfall ?
and isn &apos;t that the reason that
you &apos;ve changed your testimony ?
what is the point ?
what ?
what is the point of all this ?
to zealously represent our clients .
right .
diane knows it better than anyone .
and the ethics of it ?
hey , ethics change .
we &apos;re all adults here .
things used to be simpler .
no .
things were never simple .
well , that was effective .
so the jury doesn &apos;t get the new ballistics test .
it was all for naught .
yup . you have an offer ?
one year .
no .
probation .
one year probation . no jail time .
the governor resigns from his governorship .
we could wait for a verdict .
yes , you could .
but peter won &apos;t want that .
why ?
he &apos;s guilty .
we &apos;ll consider it .
do .
he won &apos;t get better .
what do you think ?
it &apos;s up to you .
but what do you think ?
i would take it .
it &apos;s amazing we &apos;ve come this far .
this jury is unpredictable .
you take the plea , you don &apos;t spend one day in jail .
my career will be over .
i think it &apos;s over anyway , isn &apos;t it ?
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna take the deal .
but i need one more favor .
i &apos;ll announce tomorrow .
stand by my side .
sure .
what do i do now ?
go to him .
you &apos;re done with peter .
like a fever , it &apos;s over .
jason &apos;s not you .
hmm . very few people are me .
he &apos;s a boy .

good afternoon .
at 3 : 30 today , i informed the lieutenant governor
that i am resigning the office of governor of illinois .
though i have been cleared
of all but one corruption charge ,
i wish to spare the people of illinois
any further expense or frustration .
my wife and i would like to thank all the people
who have supported us over the years .
