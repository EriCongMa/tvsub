Toby's fiancee kind of left this.
And I kinda sort of didn't give it back right away.
I wouldn't want people to think you stole somebody's phone.
Somebody whose mother is running against your mother.
That would be awkward.
I'm broke. I'm donating my eggs.
This isn't going to hurt a bit.
You've been my rock. Thank you.
You're here to tell me if you'd feel safe
should Charlotte Dilaurentis leave the hospital.
There's a line of girls just waiting to take your place.
Let them.
What do you wanna do?
Can we just keep driving?
Where did you go that night after you left Aria?
Get out!
I've got to get in there and get that golf club
before Sara tries to frame my Dad.
I haven't broken into a place since my dorm room.
Aria, Sara's staying here because this was Charlotte's
old room when she was a patient at Radley.
Aria?
I'm not used to having an audience.
Well, if you were experiencing performance anxiety
I was completely unaware of it.
I thought places like this only existed in old movies.
How'd you find it?
Well, I searched for "Romantic"
And, then "Tacky."
You feeling better?
Much better.
Would you like some more budget champagne?
Not now. Let's give these Cupids something to remember.
Look at this.
Now I know where Charlotte learned all those
special little skills she had.
All this dust and the doorknob's clean.
Spencer, stay close.
Why is this hallway so narrow?
'cause it's not a real hallway.
It's been walled off.
And this whole section of the sanitarium
sealed like something in a Poe story.
So what, you-you think they put the wall up,
when they turned this place into a hotel?
Well, the sanitarium must have done it.
Why?
Well, to avoid having to explain things like that
little motivational experiment back there.
Buildings can have secrets, too, just like people.
So the hotel doesn't know this exists?
I bet it's not on any of the blueprints.
But Sara knew.
Yeah.
How do you suppose that happened?
Long, quiet chats with Charlotte?
Come on. Let's go back the way we came.
Spencer, the file cabinet.
What about it?
No dust.
Are we still in Pennsylvania?
Yeah, we're behind the Radley someplace.
Well, this explains how Sara got in and out
of her room to mess with us.
Why go to so much trouble just to sneak out of a hotel room?
Maybe the sneaking's only part of it.
You're still really good at this.
I've had a lot of practice.
We found a hole in the hotel.
What, you what?
A hole, in the wall in Sara's closet, in her room at the Radley.
That's how she's been coming and going all this time without
walking in front of those pesky cameras in the lobby.
Hold on, hold on. Okay?
I've been working with the data from Yvonne's cell phone.
You found something?
It was buried deep in the server.
I looked, but I didn't touch.
What is it?
It's the opposition research file on your mom.
These are my mom's medical records.
How did they have these?
Look at the corners, the folds.
This isn't a scan, somebody photographed this with a phone.
This is not research. This is an invasion of privacy.
Uh, this is exactly what's wrong with American politics.
This is completely illegal, and--
Spencer.
Spencer.
Did you know your mom was sick?
Yeah.
She was.
She was a long time ago.
You better look.
肿瘤科
Breast-conserving surgery.
Blood panels clear.
Prognosis, cautiously optimistic.
This report is dated eight months ago.
My guess is that the Phillips campaign is gonna leak this.
They're gonna make it seem like
your mom's been keeping it secret,
and that she's not healthy enough to serve.
She never told me anything about this.
I don't understand why the state police are getting involved.
There's a history here, Dr. Rollins.
Several jurisdictions were involved.
They said that, Charlotte's death..
...she struggled.
Her wounds indicate that she fought back.
What exactly were those wounds?
Anything you have to say to me
you can say in front of Dr. Rollins.
Before her body was thrown from the Bell Tower
she was struck along the cervical spine
with some kind of metal rod.
Rectangular at the end and hollow.
How do you know the shape?
It made an impression.
A cut in the skin of her neck.
Alison, have you ever heard of a restaurant
called the Two Crows?
I don't think so.
What about it?
The night Charlotte came home, the night she was murdered
someone used the landline from
the Two Crows to call this house.
Nobody called here.
The call went through.
It lasted more than three minutes.
There weren't any calls.
Were you here all night?
No.
Then it could have come after you left.
There's only one landline and that rings down here.
If you didn't answer it and Dr. Rollins was gone
then it must have been Charlotte who picked up the phone
and talked to someone for three minutes.
A hole in the closet?
Yeah, it led to all of this space underneath.
Whole parts of Radley that had been sealed off.
Parts from when Charlotte was there.
Should we tell Hanna's mom?
No.
If we tell Mrs. Marin, she'll throw Sara out
lock, stock and ladder.
This way we know about her escape hatch
but she doesn't know that we know.
Maybe I really did see her in the Clinic.
Have you checked in with them
to make sure everything's okay?
Yeah. I... I'm gonna go over there as soon as they open.
Guys, we need to tell Ali.
Tell Alison what?
She was with me at the Clinic.
And she needs to know about that.
She needs to know about Sara.
Okay, if we do tell Alison
we have to be ready for her to turn right around
and go talk to the police about it.
Maybe that should happen.
Maybe this is a new problem
and we're getting stuck in old thinking.
Secrets are getting toxic again.
I don't know, just keep on trying to get in touch with Hanna.
I have to go meet my mom at headquarters.
Okay.
Do you want me to come with you?
Honestly, no. I wanna do this myself.
Are you absolutely sure?
Yeah. I'll be alright.
Or I will be as soon as I know.
Okay.
Hi.
Liam.
Hey.
Hi.
Oh, my god.
Wait. What are you doing here?
That was it for the welcome?
No, no, no. Is something wrong?
No, no. All is good.
I wouldn't come all this way with bad news.
Hey.
Em.
This is Liam.
Yeah. I know, we met.
Sort of. On the computer.
Nice to meet you in person.
Um, I'll give you a call as soon as I know.
Okay.
So, what's up?
You and I need to talk about Ezra Fitz.
And the book.
Morning, Spencer.
Hey. Uh..
I was hoping I could talk to my mom for a second.
Sure, I'll look the other way if you can get her
after she finishes the phone call.
Okay.
Oh, and, uh, tell Melissa
I can't reimburse her without a flight number.
If she can't find the boarding pass
tell her to look for the luggage tag.
Sure.
Thanks.
Yeah.
You're welcome. Bye-bye.
You were just gone this morning.
I know.
Yeah, I looked at my phone and added up the events,
and realized I was heading towards a 27-hour day.
You were talking to Gill?
Yeah.
Tell him not to worry.
Worry about what?
About the poll numbers coming out today.
He thinks they're gonna be soft.
Well, are you worried?
Uh, it's not on my schedule, so I guess I'm not.
I know this is the hard part
but after the election comes the fun, right?
Right.
Alright.
Family bonding time is over
We have our radio interview in two minutes.
Okay.
Best of luck!
Thanks, honey.
Later.
Later.
Bye.
So, explain this to me.
Yes, these are the main talking points.
I did a little pre-screening.
Okay, he's not gonna ask that.
No, no, no!
抱歉 由于出现故障 今日预约取消
Emily.
Hey.
You're closed?
We had an accident last night, a malfunction.
What kind of a malfunction?
Our one of the freezer units failed.
We lost everything in the unit.
I'm sorry, but it was the unit with your donated eggs.
It wasn't just me, was it?
We're cross-checking
but there are something like 30 clients involved.
Thirty people?
There are backups
and the backups have backups but everything failed.
The power was cut, the alarms..
Everything.
I have to get back.
We're still making calls.
Jordan?
Jordan?
Hey, did you order breakfast?
Someone left this tray outside.
Where were you?
Went down stairs to make some calls
and use the Wifi without waking you.
Sorry, I should've left a note.
Well, don't do that, don't leave
without telling me where you're going.
Hanna, are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine, we just... we have to go.
Where would we be going?'
Back to Rosewood.
Okay, I-I'll call the driver we'll get out of here.
Have some breakfast.
I didn't order any.
Oh, it's must be on the house then.
'When did it start again?'
After Charlotte's funeral.
After Sara came back.
Look, Ali, whoever this person is..
...They think we know who killed your sister.
Do you have any idea who could have done it?
I know that Charlotte hurt a lot of people but..
...for someone to kill her..
No, Ali, whoever's threatening us now, wh..
Whoever's stealing Emily's eggs
and sending us pictures of golf clubs
that person didn't kill Charlotte.
They want revenge for what happened to her.
What golf club?
The murder weapon was a golf club.
No, it wasn't.
What detective Tanner described was a hollow piece of metal
cut with a rectangle at the end.
Are we getting punked?
The picture, the golf club.
Maybe this is some kinda of joke?
I don't think it could be a joke.
I mean, Sara doesn't have any sense of humor left.
Guys...Have either of you
heard of a restaurant called the Two Crows?
But you are in touch with them?
Yeah, it's a one way communication.
The point is our boss is excited
and it would be a good thing for us to keep her that way.
Has he sent you more pages?
Yeah.
Can I see them?
I thought if I came here I could read them
without you having to put them on the internet.
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll show you the pages.
Great.
Julian had some notes about Tom.
I wanted to head off any problems.
What kind of notes?
I was just actually looking forward to it.
I'm sorry, Em.
I know you weren't gonna keep them anyway
but I'm still sorry.
I keep thinking about all those other women and couples.
You know, someone would do that just to steal my eggs.
Well, first off, I think that you should stay here.
You have enough to deal with with having to..
...keep up the shields with your mother.
Yeah, I think, that's an excellent idea.
When I was driving back into town, I..
...past that "Welcome to Rosewood" sign
and I kept thinking..
...Why did we come back and why can't we stay away from here?
What does this creep want from us?
They want us to lead them to the Charlotte's killer.
Why us?
Because we wanted Charlotte dead.
I mean, think about it.
All the people who could've killed Charlotte
they might have done it because they thought
that's what we wanted.
What kind of nut would think that?
The kind who would hold my eggs for ransom.
And destroy a freezer full of potential babies
just to get them.
Hello, Spencer.
What happens if I just ask you something straight out?
Try it and see.
Did you tell Yvonne to leave her phone at lunch?
Yes.
To prove to her that she shouldn't trust me.
That's what I told her.
Yeah, but then you never told her that I took it.
No.
Because that's not really why you set it up.
You wanted me to have it, you wanted me to find something.
That sounds very elaborate.
Yes, but this way it wouldn't look
Like you're passing me campaign information?
You could have plausible deniability
if I ever actually found something.
I'm sorry..
...about your mother, Spencer.
I'm praying that she'll be alright.
Why did you go through all this trouble?
Because it's wrong..
...What they wanna do.
The campaign's gonna leak the report.
It'll look like your mother is unworthy of the public trust.
Does Yvonne know?
I'm sure she doesn't.
I doubt her mother knows.
Plausible deniability.
Right.
Oh, my god, Spence, are you..
You didn't know your mother was sick?
I'm so sorry, I-I thought that you must--
Thank you, Mona.
What the clinic tell about the accident?
Mechanical failure.
She believes that?
What do you mean does she believe it?
Well, the way we rushed back here, I wondered if..
...maybe she thought it was more than that.
Because she's a woman pumped with hormones?
Because of the things she's been through
with you and your friends in the past.
Okay, so she's not hormonal
She's paranoid, is that what you mean?
I don't think I'm not doing very well in this conversation.
You started it.
Because I'm worried about you.
Look, I've had a rough couple of days, okay?
Hanna, I've never seen you wound so tight.
I buried someone who made my life hell for years.
I'm now being questioned in her murder.
I lost my job--
Bad things happen all the time.
Conspiracies are harder to come by.
Someone tried to hurt you.
And they went to amazingly complex lengths to do that.
That person is dead.
If you keep looking for things in the shadows I guarantee you
you're gonna start seeing them.
Come back to New York with me.
I can't.
Emily needs me.
Yeah?
What does Hanna need?
What do you think?
What's that Doctorow quote?
Good writing doesn't tell you it's raining,
it lets you feel what it's like to be rained upon.
You like it?
Yeah, it's beautiful.
You said that Julian had notes.
Well, nothing that can't be addressed.
Sometimes there's a shift in language.
Conflicting voices.
You're former teacher's a terrific writer.
Gives me a rush reading his stuff in manuscript.
Same sort of rush I get when I read your writing.
Well, he was my teacher.
You wrote this.
Not all of it, but big parts of it.
I-I might have cleaned up the syntax.
You put in the man with the straw hat.
The one we saw at Logan.
God, you were with me.
Mm-hmm.
I got a funny feeling after I read the second chapter.
I thought I'd better take a look.
This is even more you.
Is Ezra Fitz here in rosewood?
Maybe a little incapacitated?
No. He's not here.
Does he know what you're doing?
And what, exactly, do you think you're doing?
Do you believe her?
I think it's the truth.
It might be the truth, but do you believe Mona?
Do you believe why she did this?
I don't think anybody knows why Mona does anything,
including mona.
But there's the file, that's the reality.
What did your mom say?
I don't know, I couldn't...I couldn't even talk to her.
Look, you are already in the Phillips' computer.
Can't you just corrupt the file? Can you erase the report?
They can't say anything because they shouldn't
have it in the first place.
Spencer, right now, I'm a fly on the wall.
The minute that I do anything, like, delete a file,
red lights go off everywhere.
I am breaking the law just by being in there.
You know what she has to do, right?
Your mom has to go public with this.
She has to get in front of the story before
the other side leaks it.
It's her secret, not mine.
Well, one way or another,
it's not gonna be a secret much longer.
汉娜
I never intended to actually start writing it.
I just wanted to keep Julian interested.
Well, you did that.
Is Ezra gonna be in big trouble over this?
How come you're not asking if you're gonna be in trouble?
Well, I just took that for granted.
There's a fine line between trouble and high adventure.
I think you should finish the chapter.
If he's not back by then, we'll figure something out.
He'll be back.
I think you're right, he'll probably be back.
But when he does, you'll have to explain
all this creative writing you've been doing and why.
How do you think he's gonna feel about that?
I poked the bear and the bear stole Emily's eggs.
We poked the bear together.
So, it is our fault.
What happened to Emily?
No. Bullies don't need an excuse.
They're just bullies.
I bet that A was planning this as soon as they found
out what Emily was up to.
You said "A."
I mean, what do you want me to call it, Waldo?
It's not "A." I mean, it's not the same person.
It's just a letter, a symbol.
You know, it's like an algebra problem.
Solve this equation for A.
Yeah. I can't tell you how much algebra comes up
in my everyday life.
It's not the same person, but they want the same thing.
They wanna make you miserable.
But this time, you are smarter
and you're stronger.
And you know that you can beat this
because you've done it before.
When did you go all micro-brew?
Couple of years ago. Mostly because of Toby.
We kept threatening to open a brewery.
Well, maybe you will.
Maybe.
Things have changed though.
Personal dynamics are different.
Yeah, I guess so.
If you have to go..
Yeah, actually
there are some things I need to take care of, so..
Oh, no, no, no. It's good.
Next time.
Next time.
Who's your friend?
Uh, this is Harvey.
He really likes your hors d'oeuvres.
Well, he better, they cost enough.
I don't think Sybil likes me very much.
Who's sybil?
Your new boss.
Her name is Celeste.
I called her sybil.
Probably why she doesn't like me.
She looks like a Sybil, though.
All the designers that you work for look like Sybils.
I can't keep track.
I thought that you wanted to come here.
I've been buried in work for three weeks.
I wanted to be with you.
Then come back inside.
So..
do you wanna go to the Hamptons next weekend?
The Hamptons are just another part of Manhattan
except it takes three hours to get there.
What do you want?
What do you want?
I want to be in a place where we don't have to
ask each other what we want.
I wanna go back to just...Sort of knowing
what the other person wanted.
Yeah.
Where was that place exactly?
Ladies and gentlemen, the mind behind the collection.
It's fine. Go ahead.
I got stuff I need to finish, anyway.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Sure.
Will I see you at the apartment?
Where else would I go?
Don't turn into a Sybil.
You can drink coffee this late and it won't keep you awake?
It's tea.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
I wanna thank you and the others
for staying in town, helping with the investigation.
We didn't have much choice.
I know you've all got your own lives, things to do
and staying in Rosewood has got to be a sacrifice.
It certainly is for me.
It's not like we're strangers here.
No, it's not.
So, what do you think of the old town?
Has it changed much?
In some ways, yes. In other ways, not so much.
I'll tell you one way it's different.
What happened to Charlotte Dilaurentis
that is the first homicide we have had here in five years.
All that time you and your friends weren't here,
no murders.
But when everybody gets together..
...I just think that's a very interesting statistic,
don't you?
I don't know about statistics.
I just know that Alison deserves some answers.
I'm glad you feel that way.
So, if I have to take steps to keep all interested parties
here in Rosewood till this is resolved,
I know you'll understand.
Don't let your tea get cold.
Going down?
I have a message for you and all of those little Monas
running around inside your head.
If I find out that you're messing with Spencer in any way,
shape or form, I will personally take you apart.
Just out of curiosity...
who kisses better, Hanna, Spencer or me?
Watch your step.
And...I turned around and it was just charlotte and me.
My dad didn't want anything to do with us.
Jason was at the Carissimi Group.
We were alone..
...Until Elliott started taking care of Charlotte.
Dr. Rollins saved Charlotte's soul..
...And you fell in love with him.
At first, I thought it was gratitude..
...But it wasn't.
And then I realized it was mutual.
And it was also inappropriate
because he was your sister's doctor.
In one way charlotte and I are alike.
We put a lot of energy
into being people no one could love.
Like we were trying to prove something.
And then someone looks at you..
..And sees you, and it's alright.
I don't wanna keep it a secret anymore.
I'm tired of secrets.
Ali..
...There's no time.
It's late, I'm sorry.
No, no!
I mean there's never enough time.
Hi. Yes, Gil.
Uh, I'm here. Give me the numbers.
Okay.
Yeah, that could've been better.
Uh-huh? What does it look like county-by-county?
Okay.
When am I doing Drive Time Scranton?
Who is driving in Scranton at 5 A.M.?
No, just, uh, give me a call ten minutes before.
Thanks. Bye.
The numbers haven't moved in a week.
I swear it's gonna come down to the 15 remaining
undecided voters.
Well, I will hunt them down for you
one at a time.
Will you take them to the polling place?
I will carry them on my back if necessary.
Mom.
I'm worried about you.
Don't be. We're gonna win this thing.
I know. I'm not worried about the election.
I'm worried about you.
It's gonna be fine.
I hope so.
You know what I wish?
What do you wish?
I wish I would have done this 20 years ago.
Ten even.
All that time I wasted suing people..
getting property easements..
Well, you're doing it now.
Yes, I am doing it right now.
And you're gonna win.
Yes, I am.
And now you need to go to sleep.
Well, pretty soon.
I love you.
I love you too.
Oh, honey, uh, Gil wants the
the flight number off of Melissa's bag.
It's in the barn.
Okay, goodnight.
I should have you that I was gonna talk to Spencer.
I was just afraid that you would try and stop me.
How did it feel, telling her about us?
It helped.
Helped?
It helped me make up my mind about us.
Things are moving very quickly.
I think there's an argument to be made
for keeping it the way it is.
For now.
I guess we could do that.
But then we're gonna be having this conversation in..
a month..
or a year.
And I don't think I can take that.
I know it's been difficult, but..
I wanna protect you.
You don't have to protect me from rumors.
They can't hurt me.
Not anymore.
But if you're afraid for yourself...
Well, that's..
that's something else.
What do you want, Alison?
I want something very complicated.
I want you to take me to a movie.
I want you to hold my hand in a restaurant.
We should've waited for Spencer.
No, we have to get there before Sara has a chance
to take Emily's eggs out of the mini-bar.
I don't think she shoved them in there
with those $7 orange juice.
God, my mom thought she got rid of all the Radley ghosts.
Wait till she finds out about this.
She'll be down here with a jackhammer.
What was that?
Do you think that's Sara?
Maybe she needs a hand.
I want to see for myself.
And I thought maybe there was an old freezer or something down there.
There's nothing. No electricity, no nothing.
Why didn't you tell us? We could've gone with you.
I wanted to go alone, in case I found them.
The desk clerk said nobody's seen Sara Harvey
since she left the hotel last night.
Where is she?
I don't know, probably in some other hole somewhere.
I'm sorry about grabbing your boob, Em.
Don't worry about it. I just have to face it.
One way or another, my eggs are gone.
Look, Emily, you have the money.
Use it. Finish school.
That's what you wanted.
That's why you put yourself through this.
Yeah, Hanan's right.
What happened was terrible
but you're not responsible.
Bullies don't need excuses.
You can always donate them again.
Just remember to keep some for yourself.
Yeah, I just wanna be with someone when that happens.
And so far my relationships have all been challenging.
Well, you will have kids,
you will have kids, Spencer will have kids,
I will have kids, and we will all have beautiful babies.
More visualizations?
Absolutely.
Just wait till you see what I've planned for our playdates.
You know I was thinking...
...maybe the other side won't use it.
Maybe they'll have an attack of conscience
and, uh, take the high road.
Well, there's never any traffic up there.
How's your mom?
She's tired.
But she's happy.
She's really happy.
And how about you?
You need anything?
I need you to go get a glass
'cause your girlfriend's drinking all by herself
and it's real sad.
That I can do.
I'm sorry.
No, I...should be honored
that you thought I would kill someone for you.
Ezra, I was afraid. Alright?
I-I felt all of this just starting over again.
It was terrible.
Look, the night Charlotte was killed
after I left you, I..
...I wanted to tell you where I went
but I was asked not to.
By who?
By your dad.
And your mom.
I saw them in town..
...and they... didn't want you to know
that they were getting close to getting back together
so they asked me not to tell you.
And it all seemed very innocent at the time.
So I...went to the house of pies
and I ended up having a three-hour conversation
about politics with a trucker named Earl
and then I went home afterwards.
Why did you not tell me all of this when we showed up here
like a bunch of vigilantes accusing you of murder?
Because I was so angry at you.
I just got in the car and drove away.
And I was about 20 miles outside of town
when...I started to think about all the lies
that I've told you.
Everything that I've talked you into,
everything that I've talked myself into
and it was always for a good cause.
Of course, you thought I would do it.
I made sure of that myself.
So I..
What I'm trying to say is that I..
...I'm the one that should say sorry.
My parents are getting remarried?
Well, I guess it was worth keeping that secret.
Ezra, where were you?
Albany.
Albany?
The state university there.
Buddy in the English Department
and he let me crash.
What's this?
The new book.
The next three chapters.
I would like you to read it
before I send it to the publisher.
Alright.
We should go to bed.
Yeah.
Oh. No, one more thing.
What's wrong?
Melissa's suitcase is broken.
And there's a part missing that's metal, hollow
