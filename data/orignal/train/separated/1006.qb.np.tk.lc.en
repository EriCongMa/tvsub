what are you doing here so early ?
the park removed my breakfast bench .
lucky me . what &apos;s in that ?
nothing . hence my woe .
you know , ira the voice @-@ box says
we missed our chance to nab a sargent painting .
ira the voice @-@ box doesn &apos;t talk .
he signs .
what &apos;s your point ?
neal , we are con men , grifters ,
mountebanks , flimflammers .
we have to keep our skills sharp .
&quot; flimflammers &quot; ?
see ? i &apos;m already becoming a dinosaur .
look , i get that you have to play boy scout
until your commutation hearing ,
but you are seriously hindering my primal instinct .
i don &apos;t think a few more weeks
will render you extinct , winosaurus .
okay . a few more weeks .
what happens if you get it ?
have you thought about that ?
my anklet comes off ?
yeah , and you &apos;re once again
walking the streets of manhattan a free man .
i could get a job .
a job ? seriously ?
&apos;cause people love to hire ex @-@ cons .
you &apos;re gonna look dashing in janitorial green .
i was thinking more along the lines of corporate security
or paid consultant to the fbi .
oh , a gs @-@ 10 with a 401k .
keep your enemies close , right ?
starting salary of 45 grand .
that will not keep you in those fancy ties .
then i guess we will have to supplement my income .
this entire weekend , assume i do not exist .
don &apos;t e @-@ mail me . don &apos;t call me .
don &apos;t even think about calling you .
don &apos;t even think about thinking about calling you .
unless someone dies
or neal does something big ,
and maybe not even if someone dies .
the dead body might be mine .
christie and i are supposed to go ring shopping .
does that mean that you --
now that new york has legalized gay marriage ...
yeah . yeah , christie proposed .
you &apos;re engaged ! congratulations !
congratulations , agent berrigan .
well , you guys go shopping for rings .
jones can cover neal .
yeah .
no , no . this is an important assignment .
hey , hey , hey . do not let caffrey hijack your bling moment .
no , i want to help with neal .
i &apos;m kind of pushing for a longer engagement .
things are moving faster than i thought they would .
oh , completely understand .
yeah . been there , been there .
all right , well , then , have fun watching neal .
why do i get the feeling this is about me ?
not everything &apos;s about you .
diana and christie are engaged .
congratulations . when &apos;s the date ?
what ?
i assume i &apos;m invited .
follow me .
i &apos;m not invited ?
relax .
what are your plans this weekend ?
mozzie has an in to meet the street artist miss rule
she waltzed into the met and put one of her pieces up --
she sounds lovely , but you &apos;re booked .
i am ?
get in . we &apos;ll talk about it .
actually , i &apos;ll talk . you &apos;ll listen .
it &apos;s miss rule .
drop off miss rule .
this weekend , i &apos;m gonna be too busy
to deal with you not being busy .
ah , yes . elizabeth &apos;s birthday .
you need time to scramble for a gift ?
for once , i don &apos;t .
the charming neal caffrey will have to help elsewhere .
you planned ahead . what &apos;d you get her ?
i sent all of our old photographs
and wedding footage out to be professionally edited
into a dvd montage .
sounds nice .
yeah , i got the platinum package and everything .
comes in a beautiful satin @-@ bound book .
and i &apos;m flying in her parents .
your in @-@ laws are coming ?
yeah .
you don &apos;t look happy .
i don &apos;t ?
no .
i have an entire weekend
of her mom singing &quot; bad boys &quot; ahead of me .
oh , peter , you have to introduce me .
oh , no , no .
i &apos;m not giving you that kind of ammunition .
but i &apos;m ...
no .
you &apos;re working on a case
involving a stolen stradivarius from the symphony .
all right .
you like that stuff .
all right , it &apos;s not &quot; stuff . &quot;
antonio stradivari crafted some of the most unique
and beautiful violins in the world .
there are only 650 left .
i knew you couldn &apos;t resist the lure of a rich provenance .
who &apos;s the case agent ?
before i tell you ,
remember that your commutation hearing is coming up ,
and you should consider this an opportunity
to impress diana , jones , and myself
with your maturity and self @-@ restraint .
peter , what did you do ?
you &apos;re loaning me to my ex @-@ girlfriend ?
she &apos;s helped us in the past .
now she &apos;s calling in her favor .
come on . smile .
sara .
neal .
good . you &apos;re already getting along .
you &apos;ll keep him in line ?
i &apos;m in charge . he &apos;s my headache .
good . everything &apos;s settled .
you kids have fun .
wait . you &apos;re leaving ?
sara will fill you in .
she &apos;s the boss on this one .
meet our suspect --
bryan mckenzie .
mckenzie .
where have i heard that name before ?
from me .
he &apos;s v.p. of sterling bosch &apos;s new york division .
you suspect your boss is mixed up
with the missing stradivarius ?
well , he &apos;s very busy developing relationships ,
trying to expand our brand past insurance .
he doesn &apos;t work the field anymore ,
but he took the violin on as a case ,
and then it went missing -- doesn &apos;t add up .
it &apos;s pre 1700
valuable but sells for less .
so why is bryan interested in it ?
when was it reported missing ?
that &apos;s just the thing -- it wasn &apos;t .
and i only know about it
because i saw bryan creating a file on it .
he said he would have it handled by the end of the weekend ,
and then he changed the subject .
well , if he thinks he has it handled ,
then he already has a head start .
well , he &apos;s been working from home the last day
and has not left once , except ...
to teach his daily tai chi class .
you &apos;ve been following him ?
well , i can &apos;t use sterling bosch resources
to investigate my own boss .
that &apos;s why i called peter .
he does like a good gut detector .
bryan &apos;s , um ...
bigger in person ?
easy , right ?
just wouldn &apos;t want to come face @-@ to @-@ face
with him in a very slow fight .
if bryan is doing something illegal ,
he &apos;s putting my entire division at risk .
and with it , your job .
well , yes , and a lot of people &apos;s jobs .
right .
now , unfortunately , i have to keep up appearances at work ,
but we &apos;ll reconvene tomorrow at 8 : 00 a.m.
8 : 00 a.m. on a saturday ?
peter said i &apos;m the boss .
you know he &apos;s secretly hoping
this will bring us back together , right ?
like &quot; if he can get past you hiding the treasure ,
so can i &quot; sort of thing ?
if this is a problem for you ...
no , no , not at all .
but we &apos;re going to establish one rule .
i love rules .
good .
rule number 1 -- don &apos;t date the boss .
too late !
freeze . fbi
it &apos;s you .
are you expecting a girl scout packing heat ?
i thought el &apos;s parents were early .
i told diana to pick you up at home .
yeah , and i told your babysitting service to pick me up here
you &apos;re not being chaperoned .
really ?
all right , i &apos;m cautious this weekend . sue me .
afraid i &apos;ll crash the sears family portrait ?
this is a handmade mrs. mitchell original .
she &apos;s a wonderful woman .
with a delightful sense of humor .
they live in illinois . it &apos;s cold .
i bet she makes matching t @-@ shirts for family vacations .
am i right ?
she works at a specialty @-@ foods gift shop ,
and he &apos;s a psychiatrist .
now go .
he &apos;s a shrink ?
yeah .
i would pay to see you spend quality time with him .
look , we get along . he &apos;s a very interesting man .
he &apos;s very intelligent , discerning --
terrifying ?
terrifying man .
i feel like i &apos;m showing up for the first date
with his daughter every time i see him .
and he &apos;s the one you get stuck with .
exactly !
because el and her mom
are constantly disappearing together .
he probably asks you about your feelings .
yeah , and my dreams .
and he stares .
he stares ?
he -- oh , no . you &apos;re stalling .
what ?
so that you can meet them .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m trying to be a good friend .
oh , my god .
okay . i &apos;m a little embarrassed .
look at me .
i &apos;m hideous , i &apos;m itchy ,
and i &apos;m not a good enough liar to pull this off .
all right , remember , the best lies carry an element of truth .
that &apos;s them .
all right .
no , just -- just ...
are they here yet ?
oh , ho . you too .
out , both of you . now .
bye .
keep an eye on neal .
sure thing , dr. huxtable .
nice .
right on time for duty ... cadet .
she thinks she &apos;s in charge .
jones , she roped you into this , too ?
well , peter said to help her legally
so you wouldn &apos;t have to illegally .
we are trying to pinpoint
exactly when the stradivarius went missing .
the symphony recently returned from a tour in china .
now , the strad is listed
among the items they took through customs ,
so it must have disappeared when they got here to new york .
the interesting part is that bryan was in beijing
the same time the symphony was .
he assessed the violin before it traveled .
says here he was detained by customs on his way back .
yeah , they held him for a few hours ,
but he came back clean ,
so they won &apos;t divulge their interest in him .
well , maybe his files have the answer .
i mean , he &apos;s been working from home .
we could pay a visit .
you know a thing or two
about making house calls , don &apos;t you , neal ?
agent kramer .
nice to see you again .
peter didn &apos;t tell you i was coming ?
he told me .
i &apos;ll be helping you while you &apos;re here .
thank you , diana , agent jones .
i don &apos;t believe we &apos;ve met .
hi . sara ellis with sterling bosch .
insurance .
i hope neal hasn &apos;t gotten himself into any more trouble .
no .
no . believe it or not ,
he &apos;s actually helping us on this one .
good to hear . i &apos;ll leave you to it .
see you around , neal .
look forward to it , sir .
you can handle ... them ?
why is kramer here ?
i don &apos;t know .
what i do know is that
you &apos;re not breaking in to bryan &apos;s apartment .
well , we &apos;re running out of time for a warrant .
maybe that cute paralegal in judge muir &apos;s office .
boys , as much as i am enjoying this ,
you don &apos;t need a warrant .
i have a key .
freeze ! fbi !
oh , peter , you know what you are ?
yes , i do . i &apos;m a bad boy .
bad boy .
oh , i &apos;m gonna go help alan and el with the bags .
hold on . let me have a look at you .
oh ! you &apos;re wearing my sweater !
i &apos;m surprised it &apos;s still holding up .
he wears it all the time .
honey , i @-@ i could have helped you with those bags .
i got it , peter . i &apos;ve got it .
so glad you could make it , alan .
thank you .
i see you &apos;ve been here before .
does bryan make keys for all his employees ?
a few , for work or ...
pleasure ?
and here i thought you were the honest type .
what happened to rule number one ?
my private life is still private , neal .
i understand .
honest women make me uncomfortable anyway .
now , why is that ? &apos; cause you &apos;re not honest with them ?
i hate feeling at a disadvantage .
i didn &apos;t lie to you .
no , you simply withheld certain truths .
yes .
so i shouldn &apos;t be upset .
exactly .
exactly .
my god . you know what ?
hiding priceless treasure and hiding an ex @-@ boyfriend
are two totally different things .
now , can we please focus ?
because bryan &apos;s gonna close this case in two days .
so , if you really want my help solving this case ,
i have to know why you were in beijing with bryan .
okay . you got me .
we dated . it was years ago .
you &apos;re wearing the same new shoes .
all right , so i might have seen him recently .
he was your rebound off me .
well , that seems only natural ,
considering you were my rebound off of him .
you know , sara , i &apos;m starting to see a pattern emerge .
you have a type .
yes . apparently , i date criminals .
alleged criminals . i get it .
more interesting .
bryan was not a criminal when we dated ,
and i left him early in beijing ,
right when he became interested in the violin .
yeah , i think you should probably tell me everything ,
starting at the beginning .
fine .
when i first started at sterling bosch ,
bryan was still working the field .
we broke cases together --
valuable objects , intriguing stories , exotic places .
quite the globetrotter .
well , one thing led to another --
tell -- don &apos;t show .
eventually , he expressed his desire
to expand sterling bosch beyond insurance .
i didn &apos;t agree with this direction
and realized how different we were .
so i broke off our engagement .
engagement ?
engagement . now you know everything .
feels really good to share . you should try that sometime .
so , that &apos;s the last of caffrey &apos;s files .
i have my work cut out for me .
any shortcuts you can talk to me about
so i don &apos;t waste my time ?
sorry . i know it &apos;s a lot ,
but everything you need for the report &apos;s in there .
d.c. misses you , agent berrigan .
you ever feel the same ?
it &apos;s a beautiful city .
the potomac at your feet .
i like the pace of new york .
that why peter brought you back ?
he must really rely on you to help him with neal .
peter &apos;s got that handled .
do you need anything else , agent kramer ?
i &apos;ll find you if i do .
caffrey and sara
are probably re @-@ enacting &quot; moonlighting &quot; by now .
everything okay with kramer ?
yeah . he &apos;s collecting intel for neal &apos;s hearing .
so watch what i say about caffrey .
kramer &apos;s asking a lot of questions .
how long &apos;s bryan been into synchronized meditation ?
bryan &apos;s in phenomenal shape .
no wonder you went back to him .
i did not go back to him . we flinged .
people fling after a few glasses of wine .
that &apos;s lucky . my flings never landed me in beijing .
bryan was trying to rekindle something
that &apos;s not there anymore , okay ?
well , we don &apos;t know where he hid the strad files ,
but we know where he &apos;ll be this afternoon .
first we go in beijing , and now he &apos;s going here .
bryan hates the symphony .
well , he must be going for something else .
and we need to go .
what , to the symphony ?
&quot; go &quot; go . bryan &apos;s home early .
you can &apos;t go that way !
we have to hide !
sara , i &apos;m not gonna hide .
stop it !
my purse !
no , sara !
sara ?
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here because you gave me the key .
the last time i saw you ...
we were there .
now you &apos;re here .
why ?
well ... i think you know why .
i want to hear you say it .
okay .
i missed you .
from the withered tree , a flower blooms .
i knew you &apos;d be back .
sorry i left you in beijing .
that hurt .
there i was , in a foreign country
getting savaged by customs ,
and my girlfriend ...
abandons me .
um , why did they target you ?
bureaucratic nonsense .
they have to look like they &apos;re doing their job ,
and they chose me as the example .
that &apos;s terrible .
worst part is , it ruined our trip .
i hated thinking the girl that got away got away again
well , you know how you could make it up to me ?
take me to the symphony .
we had so much fun in beijing .
yeah . you &apos;re good .
clever girl .
what do you mean ?
you saw the invite , didn &apos;t you ?
what can i say ? i love the symphony .
but i don &apos;t .
let me convince you .
i &apos;m trying to convince your father
to go on a culinary tour of basque country ? good luck .
you and peter should come with us .
no , peter could never get away with his schedule .
then we should go --
leave the two of them to fend for themselves .
hey . you ladies need some help in there ?
nope .
we &apos;ll be there in just a second .
maybe they &apos;ll finally hit it off this time .
how you doing , peter ?
good .
work is good . i &apos;m good .
work is good ?
yeah .
that &apos;s interesting .
yeah .
how &apos;s your work , alan ?
psychiatry is always thriving .
mental instability is everywhere you look .
never mind about us . this is about honeybee .
there you go , dad .
woman of the hour .
there &apos;s your tea .
always taking care of everybody .
honey , here &apos;s your beer .
thank you .
alan , give el her present .
is it time for presents ?
here you go .
thank you .
okay .
this is amazing !
where did you find this ? i lost this when i was little .
you did
it broke our hearts , you were so upset .
i was cleaning the basement ,
and i found it in a crawl space .
we know how much you loved her ,
so we had her restored for you .
now you have a little piece of your childhood back .
always good to stay in touch with your roots .
right , peter ?
that &apos;s right , alan .
wow . well , this -- this is amazing , you guys .
i &apos;m truly ... touched .
i @-@ i got to go show peter . honey !
look at this .
what ?
what , what , what ?
oh , that &apos;s ... great .
do you love it ?
i hated it . i &apos;ve always hated it .
well ... it &apos;s not so bad .
oh , honey , look at it .
it looks at you with those creepy @-@ ass eyes
like she wants your soul .
do you know how that feels ?
i can imagine .
and i didn &apos;t lose it .
i stuck it in a crawl space , and it &apos;s back .
well , but you know what ?
it -- it &apos;s the thought that counts .
hey , you two , get back in here
okay .
i &apos;m gonna give you your present later .
okay . okay . ohh .
what neal found was a surveillance tape from the symphony .
now , obviously , the security is pretty outdated .
this only shows the hallway outside where they kept the strad
this is from wednesday , when it went missing .
no activity at all ?
yeah , i thought it was strange , too ,
so we examined the tape -- it &apos;s pretty worn .
when that happens , you see the tearing in the frame .
can you retrieve the old footage ?
that &apos;s where we shine .
we have the technology to rebuild it .
so here &apos;s the first image that we recovered .
do you recognize her ?
no . but that does look like the stradivarius .
i &apos;m going to the concert with bryan later .
good .
you can make an i.d. , observe their interaction .
wait .
if bryan went to the trouble of recording over this footage
he &apos;s probably going back to the symphony
to return the security tapes .
you need to put the original back .
i &apos;m meeting him at his place before we go ,
so i &apos;ll just do it then .
thank you .
see ya .
bye .
diana , how do you feel about classical ?
way ahead of you , caffrey .
i know you &apos;ll go to that concert no matter what we say ,
so i &apos;ll be escorting you .
escorting me ? should i bring you a corsage ?
有部分保守学校不允许同性恋学生携同性伴侣出席
they didn &apos;t let me go to prom .
really ?
well , they can &apos;t stop you from getting married .
you &apos;ve been dying to bring that up .
am i invited now ?
yeah .
yes .
when it happens , you &apos;re invited .
listen , i make a pretty good best @-@ man speech .
okay , don &apos;t push it .
hey , you should let caffrey throw the bachelor party .
now , that i will consider .
you won &apos;t forget it .
caffrey , i want to go to that party .
you &apos;re on the short list .
see ya , jones .
agent kramer .
neal , nice to see you working so hard
when peter &apos;s not around .
i like to help where i can .
so , if any questions come up
while you &apos;re reviewing my files , i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m beefing up on your cases
to give the fbi &apos;s official response on your commutation
we do it for every hearing involving one of our guys .
so it &apos;s a formality ?
yeah , but i &apos;m impressed
with what you &apos;ve done here so far .
thank you , but i couldn &apos;t have done it alone .
so i &apos;m noticing .
keep up the good work , neal .
we may keep you around .
here are the backgrounds .
they match june &apos;s tickets .
now all we do is print the tickets on top of that ,
and you , my friend , have top @-@ tier seats to the symphony .
it &apos;s too bad the sumners are at the royal riviera .
you know , i could have swiped those tickets for you .
saved you an awful lot of trouble .
june , are you sure the sumners didn &apos;t give away their seats
15b is preston &apos;s favorite roulette play .
he feels it &apos;s bad luck
if anyone except a sumner sits in that seat .
but you said the family never goes .
yeah , entitlement issues of the rich and not famous .
all right .
here are your originals .
well , as our resident expert , would you authenticate ?
well , it &apos;s enough to ... fool me .
and we all know , i am no fool .
no , you are not . you &apos;re a lifesaver .
thank you so much , june .
thank you .
bye , june .
bye , now .
so , how &apos;s it going with little miss repo ?
little less &quot; war of the roses &quot;
now that there are no secrets between us .
have you forgotten about the battle of the missing raphael ?
okay . fewer secrets between us .
hey , peter .
you busy ?
well , you said you were too busy for me not to be .
how &apos;s everything going ?
i can &apos;t get a moment alone .
peter !
it &apos;s your turn .
okay , okay , yeah .
one second . one second .
they &apos;d only let me escape to make a work call ,
which didn &apos;t please her dad .
is he staring ?
like a creepy doll .
you -- you want to come over and ease the glare ?
as much as i would love that ammunition ,
you made sara the boss today .
damn it .
el hates the gift her parents gave her .
now there &apos;s extra pressure on mine to be great .
well , you said it would be .
well , i thought it was , but in reality ,
it looks like they didn &apos;t send the platinum package .
and now i can &apos;t get a minute to check the disc .
is mozzie there ?
oh , that cat can dance .
you must be really desperate .
like a caged animal .
i &apos;ll send him over .
i &apos;m only doing this for elizabeth .
mozzie , what are you doing here ?
well , birthdays only come but once a year ,
for those of you using the julian calendar .
here , i got you this , uh ...
what ?
thanks for making me look good .
mozzie , this is a miss rule .
how did you get this ?
how did you get it ?
i paid for it .
but let &apos;s keep that between us .
as they say , three may keep a secret
if two of them are dead .
only benjamin franklin said that .
you know he invented the bifocal .
yes .
that &apos;s a factoid , actually .
the dollonds made spectacles of that type for years
before franklin got credit ,
but misinformation within an elitist ,
patriarchal society runs deep .
you &apos;re distrustful of our founders ?
mozzie is distrustful of a lot of things .
a true marxist !
long live the proletariat !
come on in .
now you may thank me , suit .
i chose white . goes with everything .
thanks .
what do you say we listen to music ,
stand around awkwardly , and wait for the night to end ?
sara and bryan look cozy .
really ? i didn &apos;t notice .
step over here , please .
bryan just snuck through the metal detector .
he &apos;s definitely not here for the concert .
we got a problem .
the symphony must have updated their security system
when the strad went missing .
our tickets don &apos;t have a barcode .
what do we do now ?
we &apos;ll be fine . go with me .
can i help you , sir ?
i hope so .
i &apos;m preston sumner iii .
my grandfather called ahead .
i &apos;m sorry , sir .
i never got word to print these tickets .
well , phone connections from nice can be tricky ,
but as you can see , these are my granddaddy &apos;s seats --
lucky 15b for black .
right , sir , but only a sumner can --
can sit in a sumner &apos;s seat .
yes , this is my wife , diana .
doesn &apos;t she look lovely tonight ?
she &apos;s an avid fan .
dudamel &apos;s mastery of mahler &apos;s 5th symphony last month
was breathtaking .
if you &apos;d like to verify with my grandfather ,
he &apos;s at the royal riviera .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
in fact , maurie ... can you take them in ?
maurie &apos;s our resident instrument expert .
he &apos;ll tell you all about the show .
lovely . thank you so much .
right this way .
do you know if any of the instruments
we &apos;ll be hearing tonight are unique ?
quite special , in fact .
our second violinist will be playing an hilaire ,
and the first , a nagyvary .
a modern string said to match the sound of a stradivarius .
don &apos;t be fooled . nothing beats the original .
will we get a chance to compare ?
i hear the symphony has a stradivarius .
oh , we do ... but it &apos;s fragile .
we only feature it opening and closing nights .
oh , excuse me . second violin calls .
thank you so much .
that &apos;s true .
recognize our klimt portrait ?
it says here annie chaite is second violin .
so we know bryan and annie are connected somehow ,
and he snuck something past security .
all right . i &apos;ll keep an eye on bryan .
go check with sara .
oh , gosh ! sorry .
i should watch where i &apos;m going .
you &apos;re neal caffrey .
i usually pride myself on keeping a lower profile .
what gave me away ?
who , actually .
my girlfriend --
she was after you for a stolen raphael .
spent a lot of late nights on you .
you going to intervene ?
no .
no , i &apos;m only concerned with one instrument here ,
not in watching them swing theirs .
did you clock bryan getting through security ?
yep .
i guess i was the spark she needed to escape
a ... monotonous routine .
until she realized fireworks don &apos;t have a lasting flame .
you know , the nice thing about fireworks --
there &apos;s usually a second show .
well , you boys look like you &apos;re getting along .
famously . you remember neal , sweetie .
hard to forget .
nice to see you , sara .
you don &apos;t mind if they join us for drinks afterward , do you ?
i can &apos;t think of anything more fun .
i &apos;m diana , by the way .
great .
we &apos;ll find you after the show .
well , at least we know bryan and annie
won &apos;t be meeting up anytime soon .
come on .
so , i told derrida , &quot; i will see your deconstructionism ,
and i will raise you transcendent abnegation . &quot;
you &apos;ve created your own philosophical bubble .
i &apos;m on my third manifest .
peter , where did you find him ?
well , like alan said ,
mental instability is everywhere .
mozzie &apos;s a friend of neal , who is peter &apos;s c.i.
well , you &apos;ve lived an extraordinary life .
i have , haven &apos;t i ?
as abbie hoffman said to me ,
&quot; sacred cows make the best hamburger . &quot;
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i do have to go to the restroom .
rampant narcissism , delusions of grandeur ,
paranoia from overblown sense of self .
he &apos;s ...
insane ?
magnificent !
well , it &apos;s a shame about his rabid kleptomania .
he needs constant supervision .
i should go check on him .
you &apos;re sitting on my bed ?
that chair is not ergonomically supportive .
you &apos;re good with the crazies .
her dad &apos;s liking your lies better than my truths .
they &apos;re not lies to those of us who have our eyes open .
how &apos;s my video ?
that &apos;s a smile .
it &apos;s good , right ? it &apos;s touching .
definitely touching ,
especially the gladdening of the bride .
what ?
the traditional yemeni custom
whereby music sounds throughout the community .
that &apos;s pir and elethia baakrime .
they had a beautiful ceremony
where sweetened fritters and doughnuts were prepared
to symbolize the sweet life they would have together .
it &apos;s cute , huh ?
god , they sent the wrong video .
god . oh , of course .
why shouldn &apos;t i ruin el &apos;s birthday with her father here ?
well , on the up side ,
the baakrime are probably really enjoying the footage
of elizabeth &apos;s bridal shower .
you need to help me , mozzie .
i &apos;ve got 24 hours to fix this .
mozzie , stop watching !
what &apos;d you have in mind ?
we need a scanner .
the lab is uploading the images via ftp now .
the jpegs will be opening in sequence .
thank you , wesley .
let me know if you need anything else .
know where to find you .
reminds me of a flip book .
turn the pages , see the man fall .
only this one &apos;s hopefully gonna show us
where the girl hid the violin .
the sara ellis case .
she the same sara ellis
who targeted caffrey for stealing a raphael ?
yep
now they &apos;re working together ?
funny how things turn out .
neal keeps things interesting .
yeah . you like having him at the fbi ?
i do .
then you should say so at his hearing .
jones ?
sara ever get her raphael ?
i think you should ask her about that one .
looks like your flip book &apos;s done .
hey , jones.- caffrey .
we got the rest of the tape back .
you got eyes on bryan and sara ?
sara &apos;s in her seat ,
and we followed bryan to the bathroom . what &apos;s up ?
there &apos;s another person on this tape .
who ?
i don &apos;t know , but he &apos;s in room 207,
and she clearly hands him the violin .
all right , i &apos;ll call you back .
annie may not be his target .
damn it !
there &apos;s a second exit . excuse me .
where &apos;s room 207 ?
mr. sumner .
room 207 . where is it ?
it &apos;s maurie &apos;s room backstage , but ...
how did this happened ?
we think bryan slipped out of the bathroom to confront maurie
but security &apos;s in mid @-@ update , so we don &apos;t have video ,
and sara said bryan wasn &apos;t gone for more than five minutes .
is her cover blown ?
no , it &apos;s intact .
we made a show of searching everyone ,
including her and bryan .
if he had a weapon , he ditched it .
and the stradivarius ?
e.r.t. &apos; s inspeacting it as we speak .
sounds like you have everything handled .
yeah , well , you said to call if someone died .
so i &apos;m calling .
thanks , jones . keep me posted .
when we got back from beijing ,
our manager left the strad in his office .
you saw your chance to play it .
i &apos;m second violin .
it was the only time i &apos;d get
to play such a special instrument .
but i , uh ... i damaged it .
so you gave it to maurie to fix .
i panicked .
he said he could fix it
and put it back before anyone would notice .
do you have any idea why someone would want to kill him ?
no .
he was such a nice man .
annie had nothing to do with this .
you think we can get this figured out
before peter decides to come in ?
well , let &apos;s take a look at that violin ,
and we &apos;ll find out .
e.r.t. says it &apos;s clean .
no secrets , no hidden compartments .
nothing but a stradivarius .
okay .
so , i &apos;m bryan .
really ?
&apos;cause i have more in common with him .
i &apos;m bryan .
i &apos;m going out of my way
to search for a pricy violin when i find out maurie has it .
you approach maurie , you ask for it ,
and for whatever reason , maurie resists .
so i kill him .
and leave the strad behind ?
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
a tuning peg &apos;s been ripped off .
well , annie said she broke a string .
yeah , but when you break a string , it breaks --
it doesn &apos;t snap the violin .
sara , what work was bryan doing in beijing ?
he was at the peking sci @-@ tech convention
to research expanding ...
sterling bosch &apos;s tech division .
jones , can you check and see
if anything was stolen from that convention ?
no , i @-@ i already did .
local authorities said nothing suspicious went down .
you &apos;re right . nothing at the convention .
one of the vendors reported a carbon polymer
was stolen from their lab .
according to this ,
its low mass and structural integrity
make it one of the strongest materials in the world .
capable of enhancing medical development ,
imaging technologies , body armor ,
and even building an elevator to space .
bryan does dream big .
guess what it looks like .
a violin string .
when maurie went to fix it ,
he must have realized something was wrong ,
become an obstacle --
so bryan stole this
to launch sterling bosch into the tech world .
he knew anyone who was at that convention
would be flagged trying to leave the country .
he couldn &apos;t get through customs .
yeah , so he hid the string on the violin to pass inspection ,
then he went through separately -- smart .
so we know where it came from . and we know how it got here .
the only question left is , where &apos;s the string now ?
is this what you &apos;re looking for ?
you really are a clever girl .
didn &apos;t take a genius to figure out something was up .
you were angry after what went down after the concert ,
and i figured you never got what you wanted .
i &apos;m assuming you &apos;re here for a reason .
i &apos;m here to turn our relationship
into a genuine partnership .
this must be very important .
it only constitutes a sector of industry
that &apos;s worth billions .
this is going to put sterling bosch on the map , isn &apos;t it ?
tech development is the future .
you want to work for china ,
or do you want to be china ?
i want to be with you , bryan ,
working right alongside you every step of the way .
sounds like sara missed her calling .
bonnie to any man &apos;s clyde ?
she sells this whole partner thing .
you could take some notes , wifey .
you just won &apos;t let it alone , huh ?
you &apos;re one of the few people i &apos;ve seen
who isn &apos;t thrilled to be engaged .
it &apos;s just strange when something
you never thought was a possibility suddenly is .
you &apos;re worried it &apos;s too good to be true ?
just takes a second to get used to .
why the change of heart ?
i &apos;m tired of living parallel lives
thinking that you and i are moving in the same direction .
we &apos;re not even on the same track .
i want you to let me in .
wonder if she &apos;s speaking from experience .
she &apos;s lying to get a confession .
whatever helps you sleep at night .
you &apos;re really in this with me ?
till the very end .
because you love me ?
too bad i don &apos;t believe you .
he knows she &apos;s lying . come on .
what ?
if you had kissed me half as passionately
as you looked at caffrey , this might have ended nicely .
bryan , what are you talking about ? that ended .
but it &apos;s not over .
goodbye , sara .
bryan , is this a joke ?
no .
bryan , you don &apos;t want to do this .
fbi ! put down your weapon !
drop the weapon and we can talk .
you first .
it &apos;s okay .
back down unless you want a bullet in your face !
can i please do the honors ?
why not ? you &apos;ve earned it , cadet .
bryan , that looks like the weapon that killed maurie .
what with that and the confession we got on tape ...
sterling bosch will need a new v.p.
thank you for the baton .
bryan mckenzie , you have the right to remain silent .
you okay ?
yeah . you ?
we make a pretty good team .
we do , on the case , which is now closed .
right .
so you &apos;re no longer my boss .
sadly .
so i guess we &apos;ll just ...
we &apos;ll be friends .
friends , right .
you know , friends go out occasionally .
they do , don &apos;t they ? yeah .
well , then maybe you should call me sometime .
oh , your dad fell asleep on the couch .
i don &apos;t want to wake him .
you mean you &apos;re afraid to wake him .
no comment .
el , i &apos;m so sorry
you didn &apos;t get what you wanted for your birthday .
honey , it &apos;s okay .
my parents were just trying to be thoughtful .
i know i &apos;m gonna love your gift .
i hope so .
come on , satch
surprise !
what ?
you &apos;re always so busy planning dinners for other people ,
it &apos;s about time someone planned a dinner for you .
you guys are so sweet .
honey , right here is my gift .
okay .
this is beautiful .
a wise man said ,
&quot; it &apos;s good to keep in touch with your roots . &quot;
from my first family ...
to my second .
is that a tear ?
i got one .
this is a lovely thing to do , peter .
right , alan ?
nice going .
we live to make our girl content .
as do i , sir .
bad dog .
satchmo . satchmo , no ! satchmo , no !
oh , no , no , no , no .
satchmo ! oh , no , he &apos;s gonna bury it .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s coming back .
i &apos;m getting a drink .
thank you .
happy birthday .
we &apos;re closing up for the night .
you wanted to see me ?
i did . yes . sit down .
diana ...
you like working for peter .
the fbi is my home .
no one wants to lose their home .
what are you getting at , agent kramer ?
going through these files have made me realize
caffrey &apos;s got a lot of secrets ,
the kind he can &apos;t cover up alone .
you think i &apos;m helping him ?
i think maybe you and peter turn a blind eye .
but if i keep digging ...
... who knows what will turn up ?
you won &apos;t find anything .
you sure about that ?
