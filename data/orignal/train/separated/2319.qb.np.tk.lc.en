mystic falls ... i was born here .
this is my home .
and mine .
and mine .
for centuries , supernatural creatures have lived among us .
they were vampires , werewolves , doppelgangers ..
witches .
and even hybrids .
i &apos;m one of them now--a vampire ,
since she &apos;s turned ,
everything about her is different .
something has changed between damon and me .
stefan wants to fix me , and caroline flat out admitted
that she doesn &apos;t like me this way .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever seen you more alive .
and now we know why .
elena is sired to damon .
elena ?
thought you might have left .
no . i don &apos;t have to be at school for ...
at least 20 minutes ago .
what &apos;s that face ?
what face ?
that face .
i &apos;m happy .
this is a disaster .
look . we don &apos;t know anything for sure .
yes , we do .
elena is sired to damon ,
which means her one singular burning desire
is to make him happy , just like klaus and his hybrids .
no . it &apos;s not .
a vampire sired to another vampire is one in a million .
maybe it won &apos;t affect her the same way .
we already know it &apos;s affecting her .
she &apos;s become damon &apos;s lapdog .
it &apos;s true .
everything he says , she agrees with .
everything he asks her to do , she does .
we need to do something .
wait . no . hold on .
caroline , this isn &apos;t gossip .
you can &apos;t just drop this on her
before we know what &apos;s happening for sure .
i need to talk to tyler , ok ?
maybe he &apos;ll know what to do .
all right .
talk to tyler , but please don &apos;t tell anyone else .
if this is true , then it may have influence
elena &apos;s every action and emotion
since she became a vampire .
please , no more . i can &apos;t .
yes , you can . block out the pain .
that &apos;s enough . this is torture .
kim , stop . he needs to finish .
not today , he doesn &apos;t .
yes , today .
nate , dean , and chris are all dead ,
which makes adrian klaus &apos; right hand .
we can &apos;t let adrian anywhere near klaus
until his sire bond is completely broken .
hayley is right .
the bond isn &apos;t broken until he doesn &apos;t feel
the pain of transformation anymore .
if we want to get back at klaus
for everything he &apos;s done to us ,
adrian has to keep turning .
he doesn &apos;t have to do anything .
isn &apos;t that the point of breaking the sire bond--
free will ?
let &apos;s go , adrian .
bag .
i got it .
scarf .
what--
listen , damon . we need to--
no . no , no , no . don &apos;t ruin it .
you don &apos;t even know what i was gonna say .
i &apos;m assuming it starts with , &quot; what are we ? &quot;
and then ends with going to tell stefan .
he should know .
i know he should know .
just don &apos;t know when he should know it .
he knows that something is going on between us .
i mean , it &apos;s the reason that he and i broke up .
yeah , but can &apos;t we just let ourselves
enjoy one secret , selfish day
before we destroy his ?
maybe we shouldn &apos;t--
no , elena .
this is our time .
it &apos;s never been right before , and it &apos;s right now .
just one day ?
one day ?
ok . one day .
see you in history ?
yeah .
listen .
we need to talk .
sired ? really , stefan ?
that is the most pathetic nonsense
i &apos;ve ever heard come out of your mouth ,
and you &apos;ve said some crap in your day .
it was your blood that turned her , right ?
i mean , she &apos;s been different since day one because of you .
you can &apos;t deny that .
sure , i can .
i finally got elena to a good place
about being a vampire .
you two idiots can &apos;t stand that she &apos;s happy
because of me .
all right . you know what ? prove me wrong .
tell her it &apos;s ok to drink from a blood bag .
she can &apos;t .
her weird doppelganger body
rejected the blood from the bag .
right , because you told her to .
you said she had to drink warm human blood
straight from the vein .
she almost died to make you happy .
look . just ask her to drink from a blood bag .
make sure you tell her how happy you &apos;ll be if it works ,
and if i &apos;m wrong , i &apos;ll be the first to apologize .
when her body rejects this blood , which it will ,
your apology better be epic .
elena , hey , is everything ok ?
yeah . why wouldn &apos;t it be ?
well , caroline told me you
had to move out to stay away from jeremy .
matt is at the house staying with him right now
to make sure he keeps all of his hunter stuff in control .
he &apos;s ok .
but are you ?
i mean , clearly , they don &apos;t have a flat iron at hotel salvatore .
oh . i was in a rush . i mean--look
do you girls have any plans tonight ?
i &apos;m in desperate need of some girl talk .
i &apos;m in .
shane taught me some small spells i &apos;ve been wanting to try .
oh , creepy professor guy is just shane now .
he is , he &apos;s not creepy .
we &apos;re not judging .
i am .
don &apos;t listen to her .
so girls &apos; night ?
we can raid the salvatore wine cellar .
are you sure that stefan and damon are cool
with us crashing at their place ?
i can &apos;t go home because my brother is trying to kill me .
so their place is mine now , too .
i &apos;ll see you in a bit .
you being here makes your selfish , secret day
a little difficult , don &apos;t you think ?
forget your lunch .
i can &apos;t . you know i can &apos;t .
well , last time you tried it ,
the circumstances were less than optimal ,
and i think maybe you should just give it another try ,
see if it works .
i really think it will .
please ... for me ?
you ok ?
i &apos;m fine .
it tastes like blood .
last time , it was like hot garbage .
you sure you &apos;re ok ?
i &apos;m better than ok .
i mean , maybe last time , it was a bad batch or something .
i can &apos;t believe this , damon .
i don &apos;t have to hurt people anymore .
i have to get to class .
thank you .
trespassing , breaking and entering , all before noon ?
having trouble breaking adrian .
don &apos;t worry about it .
you already got the 12 hybrids i need .
we have 11 .
i told you , tyler lockwood isn &apos;t part of the deal .
well , now there &apos;s 11 hybrids .
you deliver me 12 without loyalties to klaus ,
or your friend tyler becomes fair game .
you haven &apos;t held up your end of the bargain .
this is everything you always wanted to know
about your biological parents ,
and it &apos;s encoded
in case you &apos;re thinking of the smash and grab .
just bring me 12 unsired hybrids , and it &apos;s yours .
i talked to tyler .
and ?
the sire bound exists because the hybrids
are grateful to klaus for relieving them
from the pain of having to wolf out every full moon ,
and that &apos;s why they have to turn
until they &apos;re not ruled by the pain anymore .
right , but elena is not a werewolf .
so what &apos;s the vampire equivalent ?
well , that &apos;s the problem . there isn &apos;t one .
what are you doing ?
elena is sired .
you were right . i was wrong . happy ?
no . i &apos;m not happy ,
but what are we gonna do about it ?
well , i &apos;m working on it .
here . remember that ?
new orleans .
1942 , to be exact .
what was in new orleans in 1942 ?
other that bourbon and beads , us , stefan .
what was the name of that girl
you used to hang out with ?
that was no ordinary girl .
that was charlotte .
she was crazy about me from the minute we met .
so , of course , when she asked me
to turn her into a vampire , i did .
so did you decide
who you would like to have for dinner tonight ?
him .
he looks tasty .
that &apos;s a very fine choice , miss charlotte .
i will go set that up .
now , if anyone tries to touch my drink ,
you show them no mercy , ok ?
drop by after your set . come join us .
you spilled my man &apos;s drink .
sorry . it &apos;s crowded in here .
that &apos;s no excuse .
hey , take it easy , lady .
i &apos;m not gonna take it easy .
what did you do ?
he touched your drink . you said show no mercy .
i thought you &apos;d be happy .
that was my first clue .
she was sired to you ,
and i can only assume you took full advantage of that
until you got bored of her , right ?
more like when she went all &quot; fatal attraction &quot; on me .
then i had to make a clean break .
how &apos;d you do that ?
here .
who &apos;s valerie la marche ?
the witch that i found to help me break
little charlotte &apos;s sire bond .
pack your bags , baby bro .
we &apos;re going to bourbon street .
one for you , one for you .
i &apos;m assuming this is for caroline .
actually , it &apos;s for me .
oh , i thought ...
are you saying that--
thanks to damon , i am now a functional dysfunctional vampire .
that &apos;s amazing .
what do you mean , thanks to damon ?
well , he suggested that i try it again .
so i did , and it worked .
no more snatch , eat , and erase .
so where is my least favorite salvatore ?
&quot; out with stefan for the night .
don &apos;t wait up . brother bonding . &quot;
so you guys check @-@ in text now ?
what else do you do ?
i know that you &apos;re not the biggest fan ,
but he kind of just changed my life .
would you mind laying off on all the hate ?
ok . new girls &apos; night rule--
no boy talk , yeah ?
plus , why talk when we have this ?
is that stoner tea ?
it &apos;s spirit tea .
it opens up your chi or whatever .
come on . it &apos;s not drugs .
shane is helping me do natural magic
without having to access the spirits .
don &apos;t judge .
ok . fine .
i hereby vow not to be judgmental
for the rest of the evening .
even if you two are potentially ruining your lives
as i stand idly by , it &apos;s your choice .
i &apos;ll drink to that .
cheers .
well , the city is the same ,
just brighter .
have you been back here since &apos; 42 ?
nope , not since i shipped off
to join the war effort and you didn &apos;t .
somebody had to entertain the ladies
who had been left by their menfolk .
hey , good news .
elena is at the house with the girls
where she can &apos;t get in trouble .
bad news-- they got into the dom .
told her to make herself at home .
yeah . you told her , so she does , right ?
sire bond is not that literal , stefan .
really ?
name one thing that you &apos;ve asked her to do
that you haven &apos;t gotten , huh ?
you know what i haven &apos;t gotten ?
blame , guilt . i get it , stefan .
i get it that you &apos;re pissed that elena dumped you
because she has feelings for me .
bet you blame the sire bond for that , too .
yeah . you know what ? i absolutely do .
why , because it &apos;s impossible to think
she could have feelings for me ?
no , because it &apos;s impossible
for her to be so blind that she doesn &apos;t see
how wrong you are for her .
hey , wait , damon . i &apos;m sorry .
what &apos;d you say ?
&quot; i &apos;m sorry i blame you for my bloodlust
&quot; and for me becoming a ripper .
it wasn &apos;t your fault . &quot;
do i really have to say it wasn &apos;t his fault , lexi ?
yes . keep going .
&quot; you &apos;re the only brother i have ,
and i hope that we can be friends again . &quot;
perfect .
now , just remember , we &apos;re here
to talk to damon , not to yell ,
not to dredge up the past , and most definitely
not to pick a fight .
that &apos;s the real trick , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;ve spent the last 20 years turning your life around .
it &apos;s time to make nice with your brother .
you look like a guy i used to know .
hello , damon .
come to put a stake in my heart ?
more like bury the hatchet .
egypt .
finally gonna get to see the pyramids .
i doubt i &apos;ll be doing much sightseeing
driving an ambulance through the front lines ,
but--yeah , yeah--egypt .
think they have room for another driver ?
i could handle some war
if it meant spending quality time with my little brother .
tell you what . i &apos;ll talk to my c.o ..
i might get this another round .
you &apos;re not going .
i don &apos;t like you .
in 1912 , you pressured stefan to drink human blood .
he &apos;s been trying to put his ripper days behind him ,
but he needs to see death and blood
and deal with them as a part of life .
he needs balance , restraint .
what makes you think i &apos;m not balanced and restrained ?
the fact that you never have been .
you think of what you want first , second , and third .
stefan is better off alone than in your company .
well , i beg to differ .
to the salvatores in egypt .
cheers .
cheers .
cheers .
damon ...
did you forget you were supposed to meet us for dinner ?
sorry . i lost track of time .
i brought you leftovers .
charlotte !
get away from him .
stefan ...
stefan .
i-- i--
stefan--
she &apos;s better off without you , too .
i apologize , all right ?
as much as i hate this sire bond thing ,
i shouldn &apos;t take it out on you .
it &apos;s not really your fault .
well , don &apos;t get all warm and fuzzy on me yet .
it &apos;s where the witch lived .
what , you weren &apos;t expecting
to find the same exact witch in the same place .
no , but since i couldn &apos;t remember where the store was ,
figured i &apos;d get us a start .
maybe there &apos;s another place to start .
you think charlotte might be in new orleans ?
yeah , maybe .
where &apos;s the last place you saw her ?
corner of bourbon and dumaine .
kind of told her to count every brick
in every building in new orleans ,
and i &apos;d meet her at the corner .
i was gone by the morning .
where you going ?
corner of bourbon and dumaine .
see how literal the sire bond is .
they &apos;re gonna get us both killed ,
and we &apos;re just sitting here .
kim is right .
the point of breaking the sire bond is being free .
they don &apos;t have to listen to me .
yes , they do , ty . you can make them .
hybrids are werewolves first .
wolves run in packs ,
and every pack needs an alpha ,
or they end up challenging each other for dominance .
kim is challenging your position as alpha .
you need to put her in her place ... now .
long day tomorrow , adrian .
you want it to go better than today ,
you need to get some rest .
who do you think you are ?
the guy telling you to call it a night .
this could get a lot uglier right now ,
but i &apos;m not gonna let it .
challenge me again , this conversation will end differently .
you understand ?
fine . whatever you say .
finish your drink and get adrian back to the stables .
we &apos;ll meet you there .
where we going ?
to pick a fight .
no way is she gonna be in the same spot after 70 years .
so what are we gonna tell elena ?
i was hoping we wouldn &apos;t have to tell her anything .
well , we can &apos;t just lie to her .
it &apos;s not a lie .
it &apos;s an omission for the greater good .
oh , i see . i see .
that &apos;s damon speak for , &quot; let &apos;s not do the right thing .
let &apos;s just do what &apos;s right for me . &quot;
oh , what about you , o selfless one ?
are you doing what &apos;s best for elena or what &apos;s best for you ?
because it looks to me like
the only reason you want to break elena &apos;s sire bond
is to restore her original factory
team stefan settings .
i &apos;m gonna go get a drink .
hunt me down when you stop being a dick .
what the hell just happened ?
she kissed me .
damon , i always knew you &apos;d come back for me .
i must have counted literally every brick
on every building in all of new orleans .
literally every brick ?
uh , charlotte-- heh heh--
please tell me you had a full life
and that you &apos;ve done something other than counting bricks .
of course i have . i &apos;m not crazy .
then why are you still here ?
you know , when someone breaks up with you
and there &apos;s a song that reminds you of them ,
first , you hate it ,
but then it brings back all the good memories of them .
counting the bricks is my song ,
and i &apos;ve been playing it for decades .
that &apos;s a really long time
stuck listening to the same song .
yeah . heh .
well , you know , in the plus column ,
you know new orleans better than anyone in the world ,
which is really nice
because we need your help finding someone .
check this out-- vamp speed video .
i look like superman .
watch this .
this year &apos;s christmas card .
being a vampire is so weird .
oh , my god , i love this bathtub .
why don &apos;t we come and hang out here more often ?
i &apos;ll tell you why . cooties .
think of all the germ @-@ ridden skanks
that damon has lured into his den of iniquity .
ok . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve been good all night .
i am stopping now .
no . don &apos;t stop on my account .
rip away .
i mean , it &apos;s only damon , right ?
well , say what you want about ripper stefan ,
but at least he wasn &apos;t a man slut .
come on .
so what exactly was it about him
that made you jump right into bed with him
as soon as you met him ?
i didn &apos;t know what a sociopathic narcissist he was .
he &apos;s always been there for me when i needed him .
yeah , because he &apos;s hoping you &apos;ll sleep with him .
well , maybe i did .
you did what ?
you didn &apos;t .
yeah . i did .
look . i know you two have issues with him ,
but i &apos;m happy , and i wanted to spend tonight
with my best friends so that i could tell them about it .
can i help you , gentlemen ?
hi . looking for a witch .
sorry . no time for pleasantries .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t understand .
look-- nandi , is it ?
let &apos;s skip the part where you pretend
like you don &apos;t know what we &apos;re talking about .
we need a spell that could break a vampire sire bond .
now , there was a witch here named val .
ring any bells ?
she was my great @-@ grandmother .
she had a grimoire , and it had a spell .
the magic you &apos;re talking about
is dark , powerful .
magic like this doesn &apos;t come cheap .
how much ?
money won &apos;t cut it here , pretty one .
dark magic draws power from dark places .
casting the spell you need
requires the sacrifice of 12 human souls .
a sacrifice ?
you brought me here knowing that the spell
required a human sacrifice .
well , i was hoping the recipe had changed .
look . there &apos;s no magic like that here .
i sell herbs and homeopathic remedies
and dress it up with a little witchy @-@ woo for the tourists ,
but i don &apos;t practice .
ok . fine . listen .
just tell us where we can find someone
like your great @-@ grandma who can break the sire bond
and won &apos;t flake out on us like old val did .
there &apos;s no one .
all of her stuff is gone-- the grimoires , her journals .
we lost it all during katrina .
if a spell like that ever existed ,
it &apos;s gone for good .
elena , come on .
party is over . you guys need to leave .
don &apos;t be mad , ok ? we &apos;re just looking out for you .
do you think it makes me happy
that you guys hate him ?
i get it .
his track record has been kind of spotty ,
but i don &apos;t hate him .
i can &apos;t . he &apos;s--
i think i &apos;m falling in love with him .
ugh , you &apos;re not falling in love with him , elena .
you &apos;re sired to him .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
i--
look . i &apos;m sorry that it came out like that ,
but it &apos;s true .
damon &apos;s blood turned you .
you couldn &apos;t feed from animals or blood bags
because he told you so .
then he suggested that you try again with blood bags ,
and suddenly--
no .
there &apos;s no way . i--
are you sure ?
yeah . ask stefan about it .
he can explain it better than i can .
i &apos;m sorry . you talked to stefan about this ?
it &apos;s not your fault , elena , ok ?
damon took advantage of you .
ok . you need to leave ...
now .
elena--
come on .
i said leave .
hello , girls .
stop .
one bite from a hybrid , and she &apos;s dead , remember ?
caroline .
witch is lying .
doesn &apos;t practice magic , my ass .
human sacrifice ?
did you really think that i would go for this ?
extreme circumstances call for extreme measures .
did you kill those 12 people in 1942 ?
absolutely , i did , and i &apos;d do it again
in a heartbeat if it meant a clean slate with elena .
are you gonna help me good cop / bad cop this witch , or not ?
i get it , hayley .
i &apos;ll find them , and i &apos;ll get them in line .
bonnie says no luck with the locator spell .
they &apos;ve got to be here .
they &apos;re not dumb enough to risk getting caught by klaus in town .
well , what do they want with caroline ?
kim is trying to prove she &apos;s the alpha .
if i can make her submit , the pack will fall in line ,
and we can finally get them free of klaus .
you &apos;d think they &apos;d play along with how much they hate him .
but adrian doesn &apos;t , does he ?
i mean , he &apos;s still sired to klaus .
being sired doesn &apos;t mean you feel differently about someone .
i hated klaus , but i still did everything he said .
the bond affects how you act ,
not how you feel .
caroline .
what are you doing here ?
calling you out .
you &apos;re not val &apos;s great @-@ granddaughter .
you &apos;re her daughter .
you &apos;re 80 years old . you don &apos;t look a day over 50 .
you &apos;re a practicing witch .
get out of my store .
give me what i want .
i gave you a chance to leave with your life .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
we don &apos;t want any trouble , ok ?
we just need your help . that &apos;s all .
i told you ,
there &apos;s no one here who can help you .
the kind of magic my mother practiced , it &apos;s unnatural .
witches don &apos;t even call it magic .
we call it expression .
is that like black magic ?
worse .
channeling the power of human sacrifices
calls on darkness that can &apos;t exist on this plane
without swallowing it whole .
she sold you a bill of goods about breaking the sire bond
because she wanted access to that power ,
and you gave it to her when you killed those 12 people .
are you saying there &apos;s no spell ?
the bond can &apos;t be broken with magic .
a vampire only bonds to her sire
when she has feelings for him
before she turns , human feelings .
vampirism only heightens those emotions .
you want her free ? you have to set her free .
tell her to live her life without you
and never think of you again ,
to stop caring about you ,
and then leave her .
that &apos;s the only way around the sire bond .
why are you doing this ?
to show tyler who &apos;s in charge .
stop it . stop it , kim .
caroline is with us , all right ?
we &apos;re all on the same team .
she &apos;s on your team , not mine .
stop it ! stop !
ease up , kim . klaus won &apos;t like this .
huh , that &apos;s a very good point .
do you think he &apos;ll like this ?
kim , don &apos;t do it . i swear to god--
no . wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
if you really want to hit klaus where it hurts ,
then torture me instead .
he &apos;s fixated on keeping me alive .
you want real revenge , or not ?
stay back !
i &apos;ll rip her heart out right now .
kim put you all at risk today ,
and i &apos;m not gonna hurt her .
i &apos;m not klaus .
i don &apos;t kill and torture my own friends to get what i want .
now , we broke the sire bond ,
but if you want to be free ,
we have to work together .
no one can step out of line .
now , you &apos;re either with me
or you &apos;re against me .
submit .
submit , or you die .
i &apos;m-- i &apos;m sorry .
so you &apos;re just leaving me again ?
no . i need to get on with my life ,
and so do you .
i don &apos;t want to live without you .
if you want to make me happy , you will .
you just forget about me .
you &apos;ll never think of me again ,
and you &apos;ll find someone new , and you &apos;ll be happier than ever .
please just stop crying .
i &apos;m never gonna be able to forget about you .
yes . you are ,
and i &apos;m never gonna be happy until you realize
that you &apos;re never gonna have the life that you deserve
if i &apos;m in it .
good @-@ bye , charlotte .
how &apos;d it go ?
set her free .
must &apos;ve been hard , doing the right thing ,
especially when it &apos;s not something you want to do .
get to the point , stefan .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna be able to do what i need to
when i have to tell elena to stay away from me .
well , i mean , selflessness isn &apos;t exactly
one of your most obvious character traits , damon .
yeah ? well , one of these days , you &apos;re gonna realize
you don &apos;t know me half as well as you think .
all right .
damon ...
i know what you did ,
and you &apos;re not going overseas with stefan .
do you understand me ?
well , uncle sam begs to differ .
you just killed 12 innocent people .
how do you know they didn &apos;t have it coming ?
your brother has spent the last 20 years
racked with guilt , fighting the temptation
to drink human blood .
he &apos;s serving in war as penance
for the pain that he &apos;s caused .
if he finds out what you did ,
he &apos;ll want to know how it is you function
without guilt for the things that you do .
he &apos;ll turn to you for guidance like he did before ,
and he &apos;ll become the ripper of monterey
all over again .
i &apos;ve pretty much been on my own
since our little falling out in 1912 .
did you ever think that i just need my little brother ?
and that &apos;s why you can &apos;t go .
it might be good for you , damon ,
but it will destroy stefan .
for once , you need to put someone else
in front of yourself .
you need to let him go .
good luck , brother .
i didn &apos;t know about that .
yeah . well , next time , i &apos;ll hang a billboard .
i know it may seem like i &apos;m being unfair about this ,
like i &apos;m upset about losing elena to you ,
and i am ,
but after all this is over ,
if she never feels the same way about me
as she used to , at least it &apos;ll be her choice .
the dreaded c @-@ word .
i know what i have to do , stefan .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , if you don &apos;t start hugging me back ,
this is gonna get really awkward really fast .
you &apos;ve got my hands pinned down .
i &apos;m a jerk .
i promise to never again judge ever .
just please don &apos;t tell stefan about me and damon .
i promise that i &apos;ll tell him .
i just need to figure out some stuff first .
of course .
you guys friends again ?
thank god .
well , she saved my life ,
in spite of me being the nasty , bad witch .
thankfully , we had our good witch .
you know , your hottie creepy professor
really knows his stuff , bonnie .
it &apos;s been baby steps , but he &apos;s helping
with a whole new kind of magic .
he calls it expression .
you ever hear of a text message ,
maybe just give a guy a heads @-@ up ?
adrian finished breaking the sire bond .
you have your 12 hybrids .
now , where are my parents ?
they &apos;re dead .
you lied to me ?
no .
i didn &apos;t lie to you .
i said i &apos;d tell you where to find them .
this is everything you ever wanted to know ,
including where they &apos;re buried .
you just picked a fight with a werewolf .
you know that , right ?
easy , killer , all right ?
i &apos;m not declaring war here .
just because they &apos;re dead
doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t see them again .
what ?
oh , this is far from over , hayley .
we are the beginning .
you feel sorry for him ?
look . there &apos;s no other way to break a vampire &apos;s sire bond .
as much as you and i both hate it ,
damon does love elena .
now he has to completely let her go .
can you imagine having to do that ?
i &apos;m sorry i told her , ok ?
i kind of didn &apos;t have a choice .
all i know is , he better do what he &apos;s supposed to do .
he &apos;ll do it .
he &apos;s not as bad as he wants you to think .
he &apos;ll do what he needs to do .
he told me he would .
is that all he told you ?
what do you mean ?
nothing . it &apos;s just--
it &apos;s just ...
how can you trust him ?
because i think he loves her as much as i do .
he can &apos;t be selfish with her ,
not anymore .
we &apos;re back .
how was your night ?
awful . yours ?
same .
elena , we need to talk .
i know that i &apos;m sired to you , damon .
caroline told me .
that &apos;s what you and stefan were doing , wasn &apos;t it ?
is there a way to break it ?
not exactly ...
which is why we need to talk .
tyler told me the bond doesn &apos;t affect how i feel ,
just the way i act .
my feelings for you haven &apos;t changed , damon .
nothing has changed .
everything has changed , elena .
ok . fine . yeah . i mean , i &apos;ve changed .
so have you , damon ,
and i &apos;m happy ,
just like you were yesterday morning
before we knew about any of this .
you know what would make me happy ?
to know that this entire time
that i &apos;ve been completely in love with you
that what you actually felt for me was real .
it is real . i know that it is , damon .
i know what you &apos;re about to do .
please don &apos;t do this to me .
i don &apos;t want to do this , elena .
i &apos;m not the good guy , remember ?
i &apos;m the selfish one . i take what i want .
i do what i want . i lie to my brother .
i fall in love with his girl .
i don &apos;t do the right thing ...
but i have to do the right thing by you .
does this feel wrong ?
