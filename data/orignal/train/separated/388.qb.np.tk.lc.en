the forecast ,
plenty of sunshine through today with seasonal temperatures .
we should reach our normal high of about 82 degrees by this afternoon .
look for clear skies tonight with a low near 70 .
有2成的可能性有时有阵雨
clurman !
why didn &apos;t you return my calls , gil ?
come on , joe , give me a break .
i &apos;m late for a meeting .
i left messages on every line .
i even talked with your assistant .
look , i &apos;ve been really busy , ok ?
we have a meeting scheduled tomorrow .
we &apos;ll talk then .
that &apos;s right , we will .
you blow me off again it &apos;s gonna get ugly ,
and i won &apos;t be so understanding next time .
clurman &apos;s was the second bombing this morning ,
both in residential neighborhoods in palm beach .
homeland security been notified ?
&#91; atf : 美国烟酒 枪械和爆炸物管理局 &#93;
they want a threat assessment .
is the media onto it ?
of course . jj &apos;s keeping tabs on that .
what do we know about the bombs ?
morgan hooked up with atf .
they &apos;re sending pictures of bomb fragments as they find them .
pipe bombs .
packed in cardboard boxes .
package bombs
sent through the mail ?
no .
是atf发现的开关
same mechanism for both bombs , mercury @-@ activated .
what does that mean ?
there are contacts to a detonator
on either end of a bent tube full of mercury .
what it means is all you have to do is to tilt the package to detonate it .
so they couldn &apos;t have been sent through the mail .
the bomber had to deliver them himself .
exactly . strange way to commit an act of terrorism .
why go to all this trouble to kill just a few people ?
let &apos;s recommend not raising the terror alert level for now .
no reason to spread panic .
we got news .
但现在已被到处播出
cnn , fox , msnbc , al @-@ jazeera , you name it .
so much for not spreading panic .
according to doctors , he &apos;s badly injured ,
but in stable condition in the i.c.u.
他们大约10 : 30听到一声巨响
and police arrived ...
恐怖袭击预警级别
they &apos;ll look weak .
make sure homeland security knows that this is everywhere .
i just felt that !
are you all right ? is everyone all right ?
let &apos;s meet at the airstrip in 20 .
this is live , i repeat this is live .
yeah , what &apos;s up ?
hotch , listen ,
they &apos;re gonna be sending us bomb fragments by this afternoon .
i &apos;m the only one with an atf background .
so if you &apos;d like me to stay behind and
supervise the bomb profile , i &apos;m on that .
morgan , you wouldn &apos;t be afraid to be out in the field
with a bomber , now , would you ?
you know maybe it &apos;s not the bomber that i &apos;m worried about .
i thought we were past all that .
曾让吉迪恩陷入创伤后的阴影
how do we know that won &apos;t happen again ?
morgan , i tell you what .
而不是在吉迪恩上
copy that .

2 hours after that , clurman got hit in his driveway ,
and 45 minutes later ...
well , we all saw that .
jill swenson , 34 @-@ year @-@ old housewife
who lived across the street from clurman .
of the 3 , only clurman survived .
was there any connection between the victims ?
one . clurman was a partner
in a $ 10 @-@ million condo development deal
in which keller was an investor ,
and a few weeks ago , the whole deal went bust .
went bust how ?
geologists discovered that the land was on methane ,
the condos never got built , the land became worthless ,
and clurman lost a lot of people and a lot of money .
so maybe one of them was mad enough to take aim at clurman .
no , let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves .
it &apos;s a little too early to theorize about motive .
then where do we start ?
from the beginning .
what do we know about bombers ?
mostly male , loners , history of criminal activity .
about 50 % of all bombings are actually a product of vandalism .
一命呜呼
so the first suspects you always look for
in the bombing case are the victims .
clurman was the only male .
losing a large business deal like that
could be a powerful stressor .
well , then there &apos;s the crime scene .
被炸的受害者
why ?
what was different about this one ?
before clurman passed out ,
all he told cops at the time was that
he saw the package sitting on the stoop outside his kitchen door .
why didn &apos;t he take it in ?
why didn &apos;t it go off until he got to his car ?
it &apos;s like 50 feet away .
joe reese , one of clurman &apos;s investors ,
was here before the bomb went off .
the cops have ruled him out as a s suspect ,
but he said he saw clurman get in the car with the package .
so maybe clurman wasn &apos;t receiving a bomb at all .
maybe he was on his way to delivering one .
but he drops it or tilts it ,
and it goes off by accident .
i &apos;d like to talk to clurman .
in the meantime , let &apos;s get a warrant to search his house .
you have a package .
一路有警察护送过来
ok , right on time
thanks , man , i got this .
these are my bomb fragments .
we can start putting this bad boy together .
why bother ?
don &apos;t you just look at the pieces for prints and stuff ?
garcia , what are you doing in the fbi ?
i didn &apos;t get into medical school ?
why does that not surprise me ?
ouch . that &apos;s what my father said .
all right , i &apos;m about to teach you something ,
so pay attention .
oh , it &apos;s like school .
不明嫌犯是怎么想的
you sound like gideon .
ok , ouch .
you think it &apos;s bull ? ok ...
all right .
you see that section of pipe ?
yeah
that right there used to be part of the cap .
it screwed onto these threads right here .
but , see , here &apos;s the thing-
it had to be done very carefully
because even if one tiny grain of powder
go onto those threads while he was working ,
that little bit of friction would have ignited the bomb .
boom ! boom ! boom !
see you later , unsub .
now , he didn &apos;t have to use a powder that fine .
he didn &apos;t have to use threaded caps ,
如他不这样 会安全很多
but the bomb wouldn &apos;t have been nearly as deadly .
so what does that tell you about our unsub ?
he &apos;s one sick puppy ?
to say the least . one sick puppy that aims to kill .
not scare , not vandalize ,
or make some kind of political statement .
kill .
where &apos;s your team right now ?
down in the garage .
让他们再检查一下阁楼
是我 先生
detective morrison , palm beach p.d.
i &apos;m lead on the case .
nice to meet you .
this is agent greenaway .
agents reid and gideon are at the hospital .
i think you met agent jareau at the station house .
oh , yeah , she &apos;s taken over the place .
she does that .
atf hasn &apos;t found any hard evidence yet ,
录音机和电开关之类的东西
yeah
it is amazing how many household items
count as potential bomb @-@ making materials .
hello ?
excuse me !
mrs. clurman .
what &apos;s going on here ?
mrs. clurman
联邦调查局的
what are you doing in my house ?
there &apos;s a copy of the warrant on the table .
i know that this is hard to believe ,
but we just need to cover all of our bases .
we need to make sure that your husband was not involved in any way .
我丈夫正躺在医院里 腿被炸飞了
what are you talking about ? !
mrs. clurman ,
there are some questions that your husband needs to answer ,
and the sooner that we talk to him and clear him ,
then the sooner we can find whoever &apos;s responsible .
agent hotchner ? we &apos;ve got something .
we found this buried on the back of that shelf .
mrs. clurman ...
do you know anything about this ?
what can you tell us about the package , mr. clurman ?
i thought i knew what it was .
pot for an orchid . i collect them .
i ordered the pot through the mail .
why didn &apos;t you take it inside ?
it was for my office .
i was going there anyway .
thought i &apos;d take it with me .
that &apos;s the last thing i remember .
you had an argument with joe reese . do you remember that ?
joe was there ?
he was angry ,
he accused you of blowin &apos; him off .
any reason he &apos;d want to hurt you ?
joe ? no .
i mean , he &apos;s a confrontational guy ,
but if he wanted to kill me , he &apos;d just beat me to death .
a lot of people were angry about that deal falling apart ,
and they were angry at you .
how did that make you feel ?
i felt awful .
i thought those condos would make a lot of money
for a lot of people ,
myself included .
i thought that geologist was legit .
he didn &apos;t even take samples .
he scammed us .
all those investors who lost their money ...
barbara .
barbara keller ?
the first victim .
what about her ?
it &apos;s just such a shame .
such a nice lady , you know ?
it was such an easy sale .
sometimes i felt like i took advantage of her
because she was old and lonely .
now she &apos;s dead .
well ... i feel terrible .
what is it ?
ah , my foot !
get you something .
this isn &apos;t our guy .
回答问题依然清晰明了
he &apos;s got a sense of humor , displays empathy ...
风马牛不相及了
this is nothing like a typical bomber profile .
what about the materials we found ?
well , we &apos;ll see if the fragments match at the bomb scene ,
but i doubt they will .
ok .
look at this .
this is their nephew in texas .
and according to mrs. clurman ,
he was staying with them for a month and left last week .
有些复杂了
i &apos;m not saying he &apos;s the unsub ,
很可能会搞出点什么来
i &apos;ll call morrison .
he &apos;ll contact local p.d. in texas
and pick up the kid and talk to him .
它们也不会自己组装起来
i &apos;m down to the last few pieces , and for the life of me ,
或是否可以组装起来
they might not even be part of the bomb at all .
what &apos;s the big deal ?
you got most of it .
i &apos;d give you a b @-@ plus .
thanks .
这可能是他犯罪行为特征的一部分
之类的象征符号 对吗
yeah . yeah , just like that .
i was serious . i really wanted to learn that time .
是他们乐此不疲的本源
like a flourish .
特制混合的火药粉
&#91; 希尔铎 · 卡钦斯基 美国一大学教授 &#93;
he always used something wood in his bombs .
i mean , i don &apos;t know .
these guys , they think they &apos;re artists or something ,
so they sign their work .
and you think by putting these last pieces together ,
you might find the signature ?
yeah .
see , sometimes the design itself is unique ,
so once we do put it all together ,
we can compare it to other exemplars in our evidence database
系我们的老对手制造的
what ?
if there was another piece like this ...
no , i tried that . it doesn &apos;t fit .
no , it could have been part of a longer rod
that fit through the top and went all the way through .
tetris .
damn it .
what ? did i mess something up ?
no . no , no , garcia .
you nailed it .
i know who built this bomb .
the guy &apos;s doing life in federal prison .
把这些发了过来
the three on the left are the bombs from yesterday .
the one on the right &apos;s from the evidence room at quantico .
they are all identical .
they are made with steel reinforcement rods .
adrian bale .
shrapnel blast kills six
who ?

so you &apos;re thinking he &apos;s behind this ?
possibly , but he &apos;s in prison .
就像曼森 &#91; 美国史上著名杀人魔 &#93;
it could just be a copycat .
there &apos;s one way to find out .
let &apos;s put the screws to this guy .
no , no , no . bale &apos;s too smart .
得小心应付
也要做好此路不通的准备
you &apos;re saying the connection to bale doesn &apos;t help us at all ?
no . i &apos;m just saying let us handle bale .
look , we just heard from local texas p.d.
you were right about clurman &apos;s nephew .
he admitted the bomb stuff was his ,
which is great for the clurmans ,
but it leaves us with zero suspects .
so what do you suggest my men do now ?
proceed from the profile .
i didn &apos;t know we had a profile .
we &apos;re dealing with a bomber .
we &apos;re talking about someone who &apos;s non @-@ confrontational .
if you bumped into him in a cafe , he &apos;d apologize .
even if it wasn &apos;t his fault .
we would classify this bomber as highly organized ,
based on the meticulous design of his bombs .
it means above average intelligence .
he probably has a skilled job , a trade ,
one that allows him to work alone .
that &apos;s how he was able to make a sophisticated device
without raising suspicion .
furniture maker , jeweler , et cetera .
background in explosives ?
no , not necessarily .
you &apos;re thinking about a type who likes to blow things up .
gives them an emotional or sexual release .
death &apos;s secondary .
then what &apos;s this guy doing ?
murdering .
bombs @-@ just weapons .
and these attacks , they are not random .
well , how do you know that ?
the process of elimination .
we know bombers fall into a discreet number of
categories according to motive .
there &apos;s the terrorist whose aim is to spread fear .
比如地铁上
there &apos;s the politically motivated bomber .
来表明立场
like an abortion clinic .
then there &apos;s our unsub .
他自己挑选受害者
specifically by placing the bombs at their stoops .
that tells us he has a direct motive .
是为了金钱利益或是掩盖罪行
and it tells us how we &apos;re going to find him-
through the people he killed .
somewhere among the three victims there is a direct motive .
谢谢
any questions , we &apos;ll be around .
you &apos;ll be around . i &apos;ll be in prison .
somebody &apos;s got to talk to bale .
detective morrison , how &apos;s it going ?
we &apos;re combing through all the investors in the land deal ,
got a couple of suspects who fit the profile .
we &apos;re going to talk to them .
ok . well , if you need anything , just let us know .
right .
how we doing ?
frustrated .
i can &apos;t see why anyone would want to kill
a little old lady who collects cats and coins .
unless somebody wanted the coins .
i spent a good chunk of my childhood
1944年版一便士
yes , i was a little bit of a nerd .
is that so surprising ?
not to me .
morgan ?
i just got the lab results from the powder residues on the bombs .
ammonia nitrate , potassium chloride , and aluminum powder .
nobody uses that mixture , hotch .
nobody but bale .
that &apos;s right .
就觉得越相似
开关组合和螺纹规格也一样
it &apos;s weird , man .
他是在仿造炸弹
that &apos;s the other reason i &apos;m calling you .
在包裹上写地址
i &apos;m thinking our guy &apos;s doing the same .
确保民众知道这消息
thanks , morgan .
excuse me .
look , obviously bale burned us pretty bad .
we just want to make sure if we &apos;re in a position
to make a deal with him that you guys are willing to do it .
well , i think that &apos;s premature .
we &apos;re not even sure if bale &apos;s involved yet .
what if he is ?
you &apos;re sure you want to deal with a guy
who took out 6 of our agents ?
half of florida is in a panic .
there might not be another choice .
there has to be .
&#91; 佐治亚州 亚特兰大 &#93;
bale , you have a visitor .
you know why i &apos;m here ?
this guy in palm beach , right ?
the palm beach bomber .
somebody &apos;s got to give him a better name .
he uses your bombs , your designs .
well , he should be careful .
those things are dangerous .
adrian ...
you can &apos;t fool me .
if you &apos;re involved in this in any way and you do not help me ,
i will make your life even worse than it is now .
oh , but no , actually ,
因为我以前就耍过你
and now there &apos;s another me out there , watching , waiting .
&quot; 棕榈滩炸弹客 &quot; 的最新消息

we have reason to believe that the bomber may hand write

he &apos;ll be back tomorrow .
... be examined carefully ,
especially if you don &apos;t recognize the return address .
have you unpacked your suitcase yet ?
no . i &apos;ll go do it right now .
with your help ,
we should be able to prevent any further casualties .
thank you for your vigilance .
you were more ruthless than i expected .
if you hadn &apos;t pushed that button ,
you might &apos;ve had a chance at parole someday .
yeah .
you know , i &apos;ve thought a lot about that day ,
and there &apos;s one thing i still can &apos;t understand .
you trusted me . why ?
i never trusted you .
you listened to me .
i made an error .
i calculated you wouldn &apos;t do it , and you did .
我能走出去但你永远也不行
here &apos;s what i think .
sending those agents into that warehouse ,
it just doesn &apos;t make sense .
i mean , i &apos;ve read your books .
i had all those things- what did you call it ?
um ... a homicidal triad .
是典型的反社会分子
外加一名人质的时候
i mean , just because i gave myself up
doesn &apos;t mean that i was finished with those people .
i still had the remote . you ...
you should &apos;ve known that .
and the emotional release i would feel by pressing that button ...
well , that was just a little too overwhelming to pass up .
为什么不先搜我身呢
why didn &apos;t you do your job , agent gideon ?
mommy , there &apos;s a present for you .
present ?
what does it look like ?
it &apos;s brown with blue letters .
can i bring it to you ?
no !
keep holding on , baby .
the first thing we gotta do is to get mother out of there .
okay
you gotta it !
just keep holding on , ok ?
but it &apos;s heavy .
oh , i know , i know ,
but you &apos;re doing such a good job .
ok , everything &apos;s gonna be ok .
no , nobody over there .
i don &apos;t want to scare the little girl .
just a few more minutes .
hear that ? we &apos;re almost there .
it &apos;s heavy , i can &apos;t hold it .
yes , you can .
you have to step back , ma &apos;am .
i am not leaving my daughter .
you need to trust me .
ok , sweetie , don &apos;t move , ok ?
don &apos;t move , sweetie .
拿稳了
马上就好了
要掉下去了
过来 宝贝
get here ma &apos;am .
bale might be part of this , but he &apos;s not in control of it .
他会用案情细节来嘲弄我
so what &apos;s our next move ?
不明嫌犯在用他设计的炸弹
bait .
yeah , exactly .
if bale wasn &apos;t part of it before ,
he &apos;ll sure want to be part of it now .
电话和访客
any contact that he has with the outside world .
good . even if he doesn &apos;t know the unsub ,
he may want to try to contact him .
i might have something .
遇到了点麻烦
the insurance company thought they might be fake .
把这烦人的客户炸死吗
what if someone sold her the fake coins ?
she &apos;s on to him , he shuts her up .
were these coins valuable enough to kill over ?
she told the insurance company
she thought they might be worth $ 12,000 .
all right . do you have any idea who sold her the coins ?
约了时间见面
表示质疑
a guy named david walker .
so maybe he can help us figure out who sold her the coins .
office of supreme genius puzzle solver .
do you have a riddle for me ?
i found out bale has been accessing the internet
by getting around a fire wall that &apos;s set up on a prison library computer .
the guy even has an e @-@ mail address .
wow . sneaky bastard .
yeah . he &apos;s headed for the library right now ,
maybe to contact the unsub .
is there a way to possibly monitor his keystrokes
while he &apos;s online ?
i can send him a virus ,
but he &apos;ll have to open the e @-@ mail for it to work .
let &apos;s do it .
what do you want in the subject line ?
let &apos;s think .
something that &apos;ll make him open it .
yeah . he &apos;s impotent .
something that &apos;ll make him feel in control .
i got something .
性感热辣小萝莉 &#93;
now this guy &apos;s number .
he &apos;s visited 6 porn sites in the past half hour .
anything else ?
hold on
he &apos;s posting to a message board .
&quot; naughtyhobbies . net . &quot;
looks like some sort of site for bomb enthusiasts .
你们被盯上了
we need the names of everyone who &apos;s been on that message board
in the past month .
186 e @-@ mails .
through the isps , we were able to track down the names and
some of the addresses ,
but none of them were in palm beach .
how about occupations ?
it wasn &apos;t a required field ,
so really , only about 1 / 3 filled it in .
他肯定填了
right . let &apos;s see . we have
&quot; trucker , physician , antiquities dealer ,
store owner , orderly ... &quot;
wait .
antiquities dealer ?
yeah , why , what is it ?
personally , i couldn &apos;t think of anything
more boring than coins and old papers .
are you single ?
yes .
i have a word of advice .
don &apos;t marry the first guy that proposes .
i wanted a pool table back there ,
but david insisted on making it his workshop .
hey , reid . ok , shoot .
david ...
elle .
i got to call you back .
what &apos;s he up to now ?
it sounds like a car .
i hope he &apos;s not committing suicide .
i won &apos;t be able to collect life insurance .
yeah .
elle , it &apos;s him . it &apos;s walker .
get out of the way !
you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m all right , but mrs. walker ...
yeah . guy &apos;s a real peach .
morrison &apos;s got a county @-@ wide search out for the car .
uniforms are going to try to find out where his haunts are .
an atf should be here any minute .
sure you &apos;re all right ?
大多数时间都在车库里
let &apos;s check it out .
这点让我们猜对了
what &apos;s this ?
i &apos;ve seen these . it &apos;s for electroplating .
look at the date on the coin .
it &apos;s half @-@ gone .
he was using this to build up the metal
so he could change the dates on the coins .
to increase the value .
exactly .
就是这么炮制出来的
look over here . check this out
&#91; 牛人 &#93;
&quot; the best . &quot;
this is why he chose to use bale &apos;s design .
he was working on something .
shrapnel blast kills six
make sure morrison tells your officers
that this guy is smart , dangerous ,
and has absolutely nothing to lose .
you ready to do some work ?
why not ? i haven &apos;t slept this week .
i might as well give up eating , too .
oh , poor baby .
try not to let the tears hit the paper .
gets a little messy .
hmm . really .
these are emails from bale &apos;s account .
reid forwarded them to me .
what are we looking for ?
right now this guy walker &apos;s in the wind ,
so we gotta look at him from every angle ,
see if we can figure out his next move .
signature behavior .
if walker got bomb @-@ making tips from bale ,
then maybe he got tips on staying clear of the cops .
ha ! somebody &apos;s been taking notes .
&#91; 美国人以押韵表自嘲或质疑 &#93;
don &apos;t hurt yourself , garcia .
now find me something .
so far , nothing from the search .
what do we know about walker ?
he &apos;s a quiet career criminal .
spent 4 years in prison
for a series of forged checks
when he was in his early 20s . he &apos;s now 46 .
past 18 years ,
he owned a store which sold coins , maps , and historical documents .
we raided the place as soon as you gave us walker &apos;s name .
most of his inventory was fake ,
forgeries valued in the millions .
but the walls had started to close in on him .
we talked to some of his clients ,
and he was in debt up to his ears
and promising stuff he didn &apos;t have time to forge .
then barbara keller found out that the coins he had sold her were fake .
she threatened to out him .
and if she had , all the
forgeries would have been discovered .
he would have done 20 years .
so he had to shut her up ?
he planted all those bombs just to kill one little old lady ?
故弄玄虚
you hear me ? i said stop now !
please ... help me .
everyone back @-@ now . we need bomb squad in here .
please ... it &apos;s not me .
don &apos;t come any closer .
put your hands up and walk slowly back out .
i can &apos;t . he &apos;ll kill me .
who will ?
i don &apos;t know .
he held a gun to me ,
put this on me .
he said ...
you &apos;ll know who he is .
what does he want ?
a helicopter . and passport .
he &apos;s watching .
once he gets what he wants ,
he &apos;s got instructions to defuse the bomb .
walker &apos;s close by .
let &apos;s get snipers around the perimeter .
get snipers on the roof .
ok , we understand . we &apos;re not gonna leave you .
please ... take it off .
we need to figure out
how the bomb &apos;s put together first .
tracy , you &apos;re in .
this is a really sophisticated device .
it looks like it was probably made by a master bomb maker ,
which means tampering with any part of it could set it off .
isn &apos;t there some way to just cut the whole thing off him ?
not without cutting these wires .
see how they &apos;re threaded all around the collar ?
they could be booby trapped ,
or there could be a hidden secondary trigger .
how do we find out ?
without knowing how it &apos;s put together , it &apos;s gonna take a while .
i &apos;ll have to x @-@ ray it , try to figure out which are the real triggers ,
but ... i don &apos;t think there &apos;s enough time .
what do you mean ?
there &apos;s a timer .
we &apos;ve only got about 3 hours left .
what is it ?
we need to go outside .
no !
he said he &apos;d kill me if i went back out .
he made sure i told you that .
then we need to isolate you .
why ?
there &apos;s nothing you can do ?
is there anything ?
i don &apos;t get it .
if this guy &apos;s a hostage ,
then why hasn &apos;t walker tried to negotiate with us ?
maybe he &apos;s scared or maybe he hasn &apos;t
figured out what his next move is yet .
we got a bead on walker . sniper spotted him in his scope .
he &apos;s sitting in an office building across the street .
it looks like a storage room with a small window facing us .
we could surprise him .
good idea . if he feels cornered , he might give himself up .
why do you say that ?
because bombers are generally cowards .
i &apos;ll take a team in and we &apos;ll go in through
the back of the building .
this feels wrong to me .
why would walker let himself be found so easily ?
he wants to be found .
why ?
to negotiate .
but then we lose the element of surprise .
hopefully , we catch him off guard ,
he may give himself up immediately .
if not , we take a hard line
and make him feel like he &apos;s got no way out .
remember , we have to take him alive .
walker &apos;s the only one who can defuse the necklace bomb .
everybody ready ?
yes , sir . let &apos;s do it .
we &apos;re entering the building .
be careful . at the very least , we know he &apos;s got a gun .
copy that .
we &apos;re approaching the door now .
copy that .
so bombers are cowards , huh ?
yeah . every last one of them .
david walker , federal agents .
federal agents !
walker , freeze !
ok . please don &apos;t shoot !
show yourself !
i &apos;ll shoot up the whole room .
ok ...
all right , now put your hands up where i can see them
i can &apos;t do that .
then i &apos;ll shoot .
my hand is on the remote .
i told you what i want .
the passport , the helicopter , the flight !
walker , listen to me .
you &apos;re at the top of the fbi &apos;s most wanted list .
i think you &apos;re smart enough to realize
there &apos;s no way we &apos;re letting you go .
here &apos;s my counter offer :
a chance to get out of here alive .
all you have to do is give yourself up .
just slide the gun across the floor
you have until 3,1 ...
you wouldn &apos;t let the hostage die .
you wanna find out ? don &apos;t give yourself up . 2 ...
ok ! ok .
i &apos;m coming out . don &apos;t shoot .
gideon . it &apos;s me .
i just found an email bale sent walker 2 weeks ago .
listen to this , &quot; my only regret is giving myself up . &quot;
and for what ? to be stuck in a cage for the rest of my life .
&quot; don &apos;t make my mistake . if they catch you , whatever you do ,
don &apos;t let them keep you . &quot;
now walk slowly towards me
let me see your hands , walker !
walker &apos;s not a bomber .
he &apos;s a forger .
get out of there now ! now !
go , go , go , go ! everybody out !
we &apos;re fine . everybody made it out . everybody but walker .
is the hostage ok ?
he &apos;s fine . for now .
how much time do we have ?
2 hours , 24 minutes .
with walker dead , i &apos;m all out of options .
i &apos;ve got one .
bale .
we &apos;ll start with a transfer .
you &apos;re in a high security facility now .
we can get you medium .
no . i want out of prison .
a mental facility .
you &apos;re asking for something we wouldn &apos;t give a bank robber .
there are minimum security prisons-
i don &apos;t care .
i want to be able to talk to people who aren &apos;t prisoners .
i want to have access ...
to people , things , the world .
i want to connect again .
all right .
one more thing-
without which there is no deal .
what is it ?
i want you to confess .
i want you to admit that i beat you in boston and
i outsmarted you .
i want you to apologize to
the families of those 6 victims you got killed .
and i want it all in writing .
this &apos;s enough .
if i do this , you &apos;ll tell me how to defuse the bomb ?
only ... if you do this .
how do i know you won &apos;t lie to me ?
it &apos;s all in writing , agent gideon .
if my client refuses to give you the information
or if he gives you information
he knows to be untruthful , the deal is void .
i wanna hear it .
&quot; it was a hostage situation- &quot;
no . don &apos;t read it . say it .
it was a hostage situation .
i negotiated with bale .
he agreed to give himself up .
he came out of the warehouse peacefully .
i gave the ok to send 6 of my agents in ,
and they never came out .
it was a mistake .
it was my mistake . i was ...
i was outfoxed by mr. bale .
by you .
i sincerely regret having made the decision
to send those agents in that day .
and i sincerely regret and apologize
to the families of all those who died that day .
4 more minutes .
ok . i &apos;ve isolated the wires connected to the actual device .
we &apos;ve got one shot at this .
it &apos;s either the blue wire or the red wire .
which do we cut , bale ?
red or blue ?
red .
you know if you &apos;re lying ,
this thing goes boom , you get nothing , right ?
yes .
if we cut the red , it &apos;s over .
you get to spend your time in a cushy asylum ,
bushes , trees , visits , nurses ...
and we get this man out of here alive .
i don &apos;t see how i could be any clearer .
17 seconds .
red wire , right ?
yes .
cut the blue .
are you sure ?
do it .
all right . shouldn &apos;t take long to cut this thing off now .
thank you .
thank you .
how &apos;d you know ?
and the emotional release i would feel by pressing that button ...
well , that was just a little too ... overwhelming to pass up .
he told me .
he said given the opportunity of pressing that button ,
he &apos;d have no choice .
all i did was take his word for it .
despite the fact that you lied to us and your deal is void ,
i made sure to tell all your friends here
how extremely willing you were to give up information
on your fellow inmates .
you &apos;re a rare bird .
i can &apos;t tell you how much pleasure i get just knowing
i put you in this tiny cage .
you might even call it an emotional release .
