gossip girl s06e09
gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
daniel humphrey has just released
the latest installment of his serial--
a chapter on our very own serena .
why would you write this now ?
you were supposed to be different .
what i want isn &apos;t in brooklyn , dad . i have a plan .
i have this whole time .
you are indebted to me .
you &apos;re gonna help me defeat chuck .
meet me at my office first thing tomorrow .
unless , of course ,
you &apos;d rather a wake @-@ up call from the feds .
he is a ruthless criminal .
there is nothing to stop him from hurting anyone ,
including you .
i told you , no one got hurt .
you &apos;re hurting me right now .
lily has finally seen the light .
she &apos;s going to help me take down bart.
will you go to war with me ?
i thought you &apos;d never ask .
alors , you place the orange under your neck ,
and you pass it to the player right next to you ...
but without using your hands .
alors un , deux , et trois .
mrs. bass ?
who are you ?
didn &apos;t charles tell you , mrs. bass ?
tell me what ?
any morning now ,
he could wake up dead .
leave me alone !
dead , mrs. bass ,
like last week &apos;s news .
dorota , it &apos;s time !
wakey , wakey !
let &apos;s hope in this nightmare ,
father doesn &apos;t know best .
this is the one .
this hovel ? you &apos;re flush with cash from your movie deal .
look . nikki finke put your picture up next to harvey &apos;s .
you should be looking for a soundproof room
and a bidet and a guest bath .
what are you talking about ? i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t need a bidet .
it &apos;s for me .
oh . well , now i &apos;ll never be able to set foot in the guest bath
without first thinking of your geor @-@ gina .
but you &apos;re not moving in here ,
so you can check your fantasies at the door .
what happened to philip ?
something happened to philip ?
what ? i am a highly sought after talent manager now .
i cannot be expected to live in a lesser borough .
and philip loves brooklyn and he has
his little daddy and me classes every tuesday in fort greene .
you &apos;re delusional .
this is great . i &apos;ll take it--solo .
great . great .
the only thing is that the co @-@ op board of this building
is particularly stringent ,
so if you want in , you &apos;ll have to get a good reference .
right .
lily , i have researched
all the names and numbers you gave me
from bart &apos;s offshore accounts .
i can &apos;t pull up the records without the pass codes .
do you recall any of those ?
i &apos;m sorry , charles .
i gave you all the information i have .
okay . well , thank you .
i appreciate your help .
unfortunately , i need something more .
i better go . i &apos;m late for my bamboo oat body smoother .
good luck , darling .
lily &apos;s information is useless
without the p.i.n. numbers .
we have no hard evidence bart illegally traded oil .
well , it &apos;s too bad .
tonight &apos;s gala would &apos;ve been the perfect time to strike ,
with the city &apos;s most prominent eyes upon him .
man of the year . what a charade .
that &apos;s it .
what &apos;s it ?
a charade .
lily &apos;s information may not be enough to convict bart ,
but it may be enough to bluff a confession out of him .
i can &apos;t put lily in danger .
he cannot know she was the one who told me about the accounts .
but what if lily didn &apos;t do it ?
are you on some diet i should know about ?
you literally just tossed a cookie .
i go to constance .
i know an eating disorder when i see one .
no , it &apos;s more like nerves .
i have my daily meeting with bart bass .
well , if the stress is driving you to manorexia ,
maybe you should skip it .
yeah , right .
only reason bart &apos;s not sending me to jail
is because i &apos;m being his mole with chuck .
i mean , i don &apos;t know how claire danes does it .
spying hurts me head , okay ?
well , maybe he &apos;ll get sick of these meetings soon enough .
that &apos;s doubtful ,
and the only thing he hates more than chuck is tardiness ,
so i &apos;m gonna go .
hey , marshall , it &apos;s serena .
uh , let me know if you hear of any sublets
or productions that need an extra hand .
i &apos;ll be in l.a. tomorrow . bye .
serena !
it is a mess in here .
yeah , i &apos;m just purging my closet .
a post @-@ dan cleanse .
it &apos;s just what the doctor ordered ,
and a little distraction .
which is exactly what we have for you .
is this about bart ? yeah , my mom called and told me everything .
it sounds like it &apos;s gotten pretty scary .
which is why we need to stop him .
but in order to do that , we have to elicit a confession .
and make him believe we have proof for his crimes .
okay , but how can i help ?
the last person to be seen with that microfilm
in her grimy little paw was ivy dickens .
but her cell &apos;s been disconnected
and she hasn &apos;t been spotted on &quot; gossip girl &quot; for weeks .
she &apos;s probably at cece &apos;s hamptons house .
that &apos;s the place she went the last time she disappeared .
why don &apos;t we , get her back here ?
hello ?
ivy . it &apos;s serena .
yeah , i know . i can afford caller i.d.
you know , i &apos;ve been doing some thinking ,
and--and i realized that my family treated you horribly .
true . but why apologize now ?
i don &apos;t know . i guess since dan humiliated me ,
i have a new appreciation for friendship .
so why don &apos;t we met at the oak room around noon ?
and , we can chat over lunch .
fine .
and there are some things i wanna talk to you about as well .
great . bye .
she &apos;s in .
william , i might not be here when you get back .
but you &apos;ll be excited to know
that your daughter and i are working on smoothing things over .
per your instructions , i swiped chuck &apos;s phone .
well done , grasshopper .
he had breakfast with blair at rosemary this morning
and has a hotel management meeting later this afternoon .
isn &apos;t this getting a little bit dull for you ?
my ennui is of no concern to you .
i will not be caught off guard by chuck &apos;s antics
while i &apos;m being feted at tonight &apos;s event .
yeah , fine .
the only other thing i noticed
was that he called ivy dickens a few times .
don &apos;t try to tell me you all wanna be friends .
we don &apos;t .
i called you here under false pretenses .
we need your help with a mission we have against bart bass .
are you kidding ?
i was locked in a room with bart bass . he &apos;s dangerous .
yes , he is , and you aggravated him
with your topless antics and missing microfilm .
so if you ever wanna safely return to new york ,
he needs to be taken care of .
if i knew how , i would &apos;ve done it .
we need you to be the goat .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve never studied medieval warfare .
when the byzantines wanted to lure a dragon from its cave ,
they tied a goat to a stick .
you wanna tie me up and leave me somewhere ?
it &apos;s a metaphor .
we &apos;re going to use you
and the copies you made of the microfilm as bait .
but i didn &apos;t make any copies .
as far as bart &apos;s concerned , you did .
it all went according to plan .
that &apos;s probably bart calling you now .
start talking .
i heard you &apos;re back in town . where are you ?
the oak room .
coincidentally , i &apos;m around the corner ,
and i have time for a chat .
he &apos;s on his way .
the microfilm had the records
of bart &apos;s illegal oil trade .
as long as you get him talking ,
he &apos;s bound to say something that links him to his crimes .
and make sure to record everything he says on your phone .
nathaniel archibald , you &apos;re under arrest for fraud .
wait . what ?
come with me , sir .
poor nate .
playing the double agent got him into double the trouble .
and now that bart &apos;s wise to this guy ,
the question is ,
who will he outsmart next ?
thank you .
my lawyers are doing everything in their power
to have him released as soon as possible .
obviously bart figured out that nate was playing him .
and then he started using nate as his goat .
am i the only one who didn &apos;t study byzantine warfare ?
he thinks having nate arrested
will force me to go to him to make a deal .
if that &apos;s what he wants , don &apos;t give in .
i &apos;m not about to let nate rot in jail .
i have to go to the apartment and see what he proposes .
will you go with him ?
bart &apos;s less likely to pull anything
if someone else is on the premises .
of course . chuck ?
after you .
that &apos;s my cue to leave , too .
not so fast .
you are not going anywhere . we might need you as leverage .
you &apos;re coming with me .
so ... what can i do for you , daniel ?
i have--i &apos;ve found an apartment that i &apos;m interested in buying .
recently , i &apos;ve had some ... trouble
lending money to my son &apos;s friends .
no . no , i &apos;m not here for a loan .
for the first time ever , in fact , i have plenty of money .
but i need a sponsor to vouch for me for the co @-@ op board ,
and i know your name carries a lot of weight
in new york real estate .
unlike my son , it &apos;s nice to see
someone recognizes my stature in this town .
you couldn &apos;t find a better sponsor
than new york real estate &apos;s man of the year .
that &apos;s right . i hear congratulations are in order .
thank you .
you know , i &apos;ve been assigned a reporter to do a profile on me
in conjunction with the event .
maybe you would like the opportunity instead ?
profiles are my specialty .
good . then it &apos;s settled .
you write nice things about me ,
i &apos;ll write you a great recommendation .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have some ... family business to attend to .
but i look forward to working with you .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m glad to see you .
i &apos;ve been trying to reach you since thanksgiving .
oh , yeah , and i &apos;ve been ignoring your calls ,
your e @-@ mails , and your texts .
serena , please . just let me explain .
explain what ?
that you &apos;re best friends with bart bass ?
congratulations . you &apos;ve officially joined the dark side .
okay , i &apos;m here .
i know that &apos;s why you had nate arrested .
so tell me , what &apos;s it gonna take to get you to drop the charges ?
it &apos;s quite simple , actually .
stop your witch hunt
and leave new york for moscow tonight ... alone .
moscow ? as in russia ?
it &apos;s lovely place .
real estate market is booming .
lots of opportunities
for a young entrepreneur like yourself .
and how long do you expect me to live in exile ?
forever .
you can never come back to new york .
that &apos;s not a deal .
that &apos;s a different kind of prison sentence .
i will find another way to get nate out of jail .
there is no other way .
don &apos;t you get it ?
i &apos;m very close friends with the police commissioner .
the only person who can get nate out of jail
is me .
we &apos;ll see how powerful you are
when you are locked inside with him .
if you want to go to chuck , go .
you can trust me .
you were right . i need to help you get rid of bart
if i wanna come back to new york
to be with the man that i love .
we have a pact , just like you and chuck .
rufus ?
what kind of cockamamie love pact did you make with rufus ?
it &apos;s not rufus ,
although i &apos;m not at liberty to name names at this time .
really ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m just dying to know .
oh , no .
the samples just came in and they are a disaster .
i have to go back to the atelier .
don &apos;t answer your phone unless it &apos;s me ,
and do not move off that couch .
dorota will be able to tell
if there are fresh footprints on the aubusson .
i saw your picture all over the news .
what happened ?
bart figured out i was playing both sides ,
and this is his way of retaliating .
how are you doing ?
well ... better now that you &apos;re here .
tmz leaked your mug shot ,
and you actually look pretty cute .
well , cute is gonna help me now .
i spoke with chuck &apos;s lawyers ,
and they haven &apos;t made any progress
in getting me out on bail .
well , i know you don &apos;t trust your grandfather
or anyone from the van der bilt side of the family ,
so i called someone
who has some experience with this kind of situation .
dad ?
why are you stopping ?
hello ? ! are you deaf ?
will you give me a hand signal ?
i @-@ i speak fluent sign .
what the hell are you doing ? !
taking you for a little ride .
looking for me ?
where &apos;s blair ?
she texted me and said she &apos;s here .
if you &apos;ve done something ...
blair is fine , okay ?
she &apos;s upstairs in the atelier , unharmed .
she &apos;s fine
because i decided she could be fine .
maybe next time i make a different decision .
so perhaps you &apos;d like to ...
reconsider my earlier offer ?
are you threatening blair with physical harm ?
me ? no .
i wouldn &apos;t hurt a fly .
but i &apos;m not god .
i can &apos;t help it if accidents happen .
this fight is between me and you .
leave everyone else out of it .
if you want your best friend to get out of jail ,
your stepmother to enjoy her happy marriage ,
your girlfriend to continue making
her pretty little dresses ...
then a new life on the other side of the world
is your only option .
the bass jet is waiting on the tarmac .
go to moscow tonight ,
then everyone you love
will be safe .
i spoke to your lawyers .
the judge is refusing to set bail .
this can &apos;t be happening .
you &apos;re clearly being victimized
because of the mistakes i &apos;ve made in the past .
now don &apos;t worry . it &apos;ll all get sorted out .
no , it won &apos;t , dad .
i did it . i &apos;m guilty .
nate .
you &apos;ve always done the right thing .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d do something like this .
although , after the example i set for ya ,
i suppose i only have myself to blame .
this was all me .
i fudged the numbers to try and save &quot; the spectator . &quot;
so you slipped .
you &apos;ve always stood by me . it &apos;s my turn to stand by you .
we &apos;ll go to the lender , explain everything to them ,
pay them whatever you owe .
they &apos;ll drop the charges .
no .
the only person that can drop the charges is bart bass ,
and he won &apos;t budge .
dorota , the samples were pristine .
it was a false alarm--
merely bart bass fanning the flames .
so make sure that ivy &apos;s ass stays glued
to that couch cushion .
yes , this is blair waldorf .
apparently , my town car has been absconded
by a ruthless billionaire .
so if you &apos;d please send another--
preferably with a different , less devious driver ...
no . no , what do you mean ?
i &apos;m not still in the car . i &apos;m right here .
why ? where &apos;d it go ?
thank you .
you seem engrossed .
oh , i am .
normally , i don &apos;t go for ...
romance novels , but , uh ...
the way you describe serena ...
where &apos;d you get that ?
a package came this afternoon .
thinking it was your profile on me , i opened it .
yeah , well , uh ,
i wrote two versions of the serena chapter ,
and that &apos;s-- that &apos;s the nice one .
i prefer the nasty one you published .
i &apos;m not sure that was the best decision .
why not ?
when i was staying here with serena , i ...
do you wanna hear this ?
i was trying to make her fall in love with me .
so i could write the ultimate expose ,
bringing down the golden girl .
but while i was busy trying to win her affections ,
i realized i was still in love with her .
and wrote this nonsense .
i would &apos;ve published it , too , but , uh ,
but on thanksgiving , i realized that serena was ...
never gonna take me seriously
unless i could show her that i wasn &apos;t afraid of her ,
that i didn &apos;t think she was better than me .
bravo .
you made the right decision .
yeah , but she won &apos;t speak to me now .
let your father
serve as a cautionary tale , daniel .
he &apos;s sitting over there in brooklyn alone ,
while i &apos;m here married to lily .
serena respects you now ,
even if she doesn &apos;t know it .
you stay the course , she will come around in time .
that was the idea , but it &apos;s , uh ,
it &apos;s taking a little longer than i expected .
well ... hopefully , you have a few more days
until she moves to los angeles .
los angeles ?
chuck !
stop ! what are you doing ?
i couldn &apos;t live with myself if anything happened to you .
but i &apos;m fine .
because i &apos;m leaving .
it &apos;s a small price to pay for your safety .
but i don &apos;t want to be safe .
i wanna be with you .
come on . let &apos;s go together .
i &apos;ll have dorota send my things .
blair , i can &apos;t .
i have to go alone .
i made a deal . those were my father &apos;s terms .
just have faith in me ,
this one last time .
but i @-@ i &apos;ve waited too long . i need to be with you now .
blair , trust me .
letting me go is the right thing to do .
no .
don &apos;t get on the plane .
bart has already hurt so many people .
i know what my father &apos;s capable of ,
but he would never try to kill his own son .
then ... do one thing before you go .
kiss me , chuck bass .
i have called you all here because you are
the most conniving group of scammers and schemers
that i know .
and , serena , you &apos;re my best friend .
thanks for clarifying .
i still don &apos;t understand why georgina &apos;s here , though .
you can &apos;t have an evil cabal without the queen of con .
and frankly , i should &apos;ve been given more notice .
you lost your royal status
when i took your phone at cotillion .
ha . phone stealing ? seriously ?
that &apos;s the training bra of treachery .
enough !
if i wanted infighting , i would &apos;ve called my minions .
now i need her here . i need you all here
to use your dastardly skills to take down bart bass .
yeah , but last time we did that , nate ended up in jail .
do you want to go back to being the goat
or lend your impersonation prowess to my plan ?
blair , are you sure
chuck would want you involved in his war ?
it &apos;s not his choice .
now i want you all to get bart talking .
and record him on your phones .
we &apos;ll merge your master manipulations ,
your wanton disregard for authority ,
and your brilliance at playing dumb .
bart bass may be able to fool the fbi ,
but he has never had to face off against
blair waldorf and her bitches .
bart , hey .
my mom wanted me to tell you she &apos;s so sorry she can &apos;t be here
to celebrate your accomplishments .
all this does seem rather impressive , doesn &apos;t it ?
hey , maybe you can show her the slide show when she returns .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;d love to see your travels .
is everything okay ?
i don &apos;t remember approving that slide .
well , obviously someone likes it .
obviously , there &apos;s a glitch in the system .
if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
have you gotten this evening &apos;s program ?
you look even more dashing in it than you do in person .
well , at least they followed my instructions
regarding this part of the presentation .
tell me the truth ,
do you trade on your good looks to get all your adoring donors ?
how did you get lady alexander to give so much ,
and twice on sundays ...
i bet she really put you through your paces .
did you give this to anyone else ?
no .
unless you count everybody here .
whatever it is you &apos;re trying to pull ,
i &apos;m putting a stop to it .
great job on stealing the dead guy &apos;s phone .
now just keep calling bart until he cracks .
i &apos;m gonna start phase two .
yeah , i know .
serena , there you are .
dan . what are you doing here ?
oh , wait ! i forgot .
you &apos;re honoring your new mentor bart bass .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i need to be anywhere but here .
just tell me if you are really leaving town .
what do you care ? you can just as easily
write despicable things about me from afar .
i know you &apos;re mad ,
but that chapter &apos;s not the only thing i &apos;ve written about you .
the--the most flattering things i &apos;ve written about anyone
have been about you , too .
oh , okay , that was five years ago .
since then , i &apos;ve been
the empty @-@ headed blonde in &quot; inside , &quot;
and--and the golden girl with daddy issues in &quot; inside out . &quot;
your writing changed , and so did you .
that &apos;s no reason to leave your entire world behind .
my world turned you from a person with integrity
into a cruel satirist .
i mean , you &apos;re worse than gossip girl .
at least she has a conscience .
no matter what it looks like , i &apos;m still on your side , serena .
i always have been .
yeah , well , excuse me if i don &apos;t wait around
to be disappointed again .
i &apos;m moving to l.a.
just as soon as i &apos;m done helping blair with bart ,
which ... you should be doing , too ,
but you &apos;re on his side .
hire more staff if you have to .
i will not be embarrassed at my own party .
okay .
excuse me , sir . would you like a cocktail ?
we have a lovely sudanese vodka .
what the hell are you doing here ?
just a waitress trying to serve you a drink ,
which you look like you could use .
lily destroyed what was inside of this already .
or did i make copies ?
you never know which one of these
has what you &apos;re looking for .
bart ?
there you are .
perhaps you remember my very special guest
iman hassan ?
you did some oil dealings with her father .
it &apos;s lovely to see you , iman .
although i never did any business with your father .
we were simply good friends .
who shared a love of horses .
yes , that &apos;s right .
how is her dear lady alexander
living out her days at your horse farm ?
grazing away happily , i should think .
i know what you did to my horse .
did you murder my father , too ?
i loved your father like a brother .
if you &apos;ll excuse us , iman ...
we need a moment .
tell security where i am .
i wouldn &apos;t want to go mysteriously missing .
i know what you &apos;re trying to doing
with the envelopes and the phony phone calls .
i &apos;ve seen &quot; a christmas carol . &quot;
the classic tale
of misdeeds haunting a man who didn &apos;t remedy them .
you know , i &apos;ve always felt that scrooge was unfairly maligned .
he simply expected people to act like adults .
and in other news ...
there is no santa claus , ms. waldorf .
... owned and operated by bass industries .
the g2 was reported missing off the coast of maine .
wait . turn that up .
sure .
the coast guard is investigating the area
where the plane went off the radar
after sending a mayday signal .
oh , no .
i hope that wasn &apos;t the one chuck was on .
at present , there was no communication from the plane .
a search and rescue operation is currently underway
to identify victims .
good evening . my name is jason pomeranc ,
and i &apos;m the chairman and founder of thompson hotels .
i &apos;d like to take this opportunity to welcome you all
to new york real estate &apos;s man of the year award .
that &apos;s my cue .
the exact number of passengers aboard the plane
is still uncertain .
we &apos;ll bring you more information as it becomes available .
and in other news ...
bart bass has been a boon to manhattan &apos;s skyline .
to truly introduce him properly ,
it &apos;s my honor to present
the number one chronicler of manhattan &apos;s elite--
mr. daniel humphrey .
i would like to introduce an icon
of new york real estate and a pillar of our community .
he is the center of the bass family
and he &apos;s a personal inspiration to me .
please welcome
charles bass .
thank you . thank you .
my father is being honored here as a humanitarian ,
but the last time i checked ,
humanitarians value human life ...
and he just tried to have his own son killed .
isn &apos;t that why you look so surprised ?
you put me on that plane to die ?
looks like chuck found the emergency exit at 10,000 feet .
let &apos;s hope he can avoid going six feet under ... again .
i would like to apologize
for my son &apos;s outburst .
as many of you here know ,
he has long struggled with substance abuse .
i have already contacted the pedowitz institute ,
and i can only hope that he will accept
the help that he so desperately needs .
please , let &apos;s not let him ruin this otherwise festive evening .
thank you , everybody .
i overestimated you .
you &apos;re just lucky that security is getting chuck
home to his suite before he can do any more damage .
at least you know chuck &apos;s okay .
i still despise you ,
but thank you for doing the right thing for once .
wait a second . wait a second . do you know where serena went ?
why would i tell you , even if i did ?
so you can con her into falling in love with you
and humiliate her again ?
no , i was hoping after my speech that
maybe she would change her mind about me and about leaving town .
i really hope that you &apos;re referring to a vacation spot
too elite for the likes of you .
no , i &apos;m talking about l.a. , for good .
i retract everything civil i just said .
this is all your fault .
if serena moves away ,
i will never forgive you , humphrey .
let me guess .
prison overcrowding ,
or did they let the both of you out on good behavior ?
my son never should &apos;ve been behind bars in the first place .
but look at how the two of you have bonded over it ,
so you &apos;re welcome .
okay , you &apos;ve had your fun .
now what will it take for you to get your name off my loan document
so i can own my paper again ?
see , that &apos;s the problem with this generation .
they &apos;re so entitled . they don &apos;t even say &quot; please . &quot;
nate worked his ass off to build that paper .
he never asked you to cosign for him
and he &apos;s not asking for charity now .
we &apos;ll pay whatever it &apos;s worth .
a million dollars .
done .
i &apos;m kidding . it &apos;s not for sale .
the amount of enjoyment i plan on getting watching nate squirm ?
priceless .
come on , bart.
don &apos;t do this to my kid .
enjoy yourselves tonight , archibalds .
drinks are on me .
please tell me that you are heading home
to get a good night &apos;s sleep after a trying day
and not picking up your bags and going to the airport .
i &apos;m sorry , blair . you know i &apos;m terrible at good @-@ byes .
well , i won &apos;t let you say one now .
i know that things are bad ,
but they &apos;re never as bad as you think .
you were the one who taught me that .
do you remember junior year ,
when i was standing out on that helipad ,
ready to flee to europe
after my &quot; who &apos;s the daddy ? &quot; pregnancy scandal ?
and you weren &apos;t even pregnant .
you know , we can laugh about it now because ...
you didn &apos;t let me go .
you told me that the scandal always passes ,
and so will dan &apos;s expose .
not as long as i live here .
in los angeles , no one cares if i date the wrong guy .
i mean , they don &apos;t care about anything i do .
i have the chance to reinvent myself .
reinvention is for starlets from trailer parks
who want to be you .
seriously , do you know
how few friendships make it out of high school ?
we finally got to the good part . you can &apos;t leave now .
but you were the one that said
we &apos;re better when we have our own territories .
remember paris ? right bank , left bank ?
well , then move to the west side and we &apos;ll meet in central park !
and when we do ,
there will be enough light for both of us to shine .
yeah , but i &apos;d still be living in my own shadow .
i have to go .
but ...
there &apos;s no sarabeth &apos;s in l.a.
or serendipity .
or me .
please just think about it .
leave a message , and i &apos;ll listen to it .
hey , it &apos;s me . why aren &apos;t you answering your phone ?
thank you for waiting .
i had no choice . your guards locked me out .
i wanted for us to have a chance to talk privately .
you know , i knew you were cold and ruthless ,
but i never thought you &apos;d try to kill your own son .
we had a deal .
your friend is out of jail .
you were supposed to be on a plane to russia .
you never intended for me to make it to moscow .
you arranged for the pilot to parachute to safety
while i was left to die on the plane .
you have always had
a wonderfully vivid imagination .
but i warned you earlier ...
accidents can happen .
we should work together more often .
i &apos;m just over coddling creative types .
there &apos;s a whole untapped niche in schemers for hire .
have you seen chuck ?
bart said that security took him home ,
but i called nate .
chuck &apos;s not there and he &apos;s not answering his phone .
well , he &apos;s here somewhere . he hasn &apos;t left the building .
how do you know ?
the security guards at the exits are under strict instructions
to inform us of all bass departures .
i have my ways of insuring their loyalty .
where &apos;s bart ?
last time i saw him , he was getting on the elevator .
all i &apos;ve been trying to do for the past two years is just ...
build something that i can be proud of .
instead , i lost it ,
and my reputation and ...
most of my trust fund .
sorry i wasn &apos;t there for you sooner , son .
just never wanted you to end up like me .
hey . you didn &apos;t end up so bad .
whatever you decide to set your mind to next ,
i know you can achieve it .
thanks , dad .
your dad &apos;s right , you know .
you can start over .
when i first met you ,
you had the perfect story to get new york &apos;s attention .
what , gossip girl &apos;s identity ?
i promised her i &apos;d stop looking
after if she helped find serena .
who knew she was perfectly fine .
she set you up to protect herself .
what do you have to lose
by going through your research one more time ?
nothing anymore .
in fact , i , uh ...
i brought it home
so that no one at &quot; the spectator &quot; would find it .
garcon , where are the stairs ?
the elevators are taking forever .
what are you doing here ? and with a suitcase ?
i got an apartment in the building .
what ?
i finally realized where i wanna be ,
and it &apos;s here , where you are .
where i used to be .
i have no interest in being anywhere around here anymore .
i don &apos;t believe that .
you run away to--to spain ,
upstate , boarding school , santorini .
you always come back .
well , that was then .
that was before i knew
what this place could do to people ,
before i saw it turn you into bart bass .
i &apos;m not bart.
but what &apos;s wrong with wanting power ? you have it .
maybe if you stopped hating it ,
you &apos;d stop hating yourself .
then you can finally be happy where--where you belong .
okay , you know what ?
i have no interest in being psychoanalyzed
by my evil biographer .
serena , i know i &apos;ve hurt you ,
but i still love you .
i &apos;ve lost track of it at times .
i &apos;ve made mistakes--
i &apos;ve made massive , heartbreaking mistakes--
but i &apos;ve never stopped loving you .
well , excuse me if i don &apos;t fall for that ,
or you , ever again .
please , just ...
if you come upstairs for a second ,
i have something i can show you that &apos;ll prove it .
i &apos;ve seen all i need to see .
i have a plane waiting .
tell me ...
did you try to have me killed
because you hate me so much
or because i know too much ?
you know , no matter how hard i have tried
to turn you into a man ,
it still remains the one big failure of my life .
you &apos;re not a man .
a man accepts responsibility for his actions .
a man takes care of his family .
a man doesn &apos;t pay a mother to abandon her child
and then tell that child his mother is dead .
a man doesn &apos;t try to have his own son killed !
but you can tell the police what kind of a man you are .
your naivete is adorable .
even if i didn &apos;t have
the police commissioner in my pocket ,
who do you think they &apos;re gonna believe ? huh ?
the man of the year
or some sad ,
pathetic ,
little boy ? !
chuck ...
give me your hand !
you know i &apos;m all talk !
i would never really hurt you !
everything you say is a lie !
charles ,
this isn &apos;t who you are .
please , son !
come on . we have to get out of here .
