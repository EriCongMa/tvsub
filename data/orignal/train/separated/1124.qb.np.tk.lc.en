who does not want a big , slobbering beast
who can catch a ball in the end zone ?
that &apos;s it .
god ! sean , stop ! don &apos;t hit him !
i am being honest with you . i have a boyfriend .
and i think you deserve a better boyfriend .
your friend left her backpack here .
i returned it to her parents .
are you doing drugs with her ?
what are you talking about ?
are you stoned ?
no !
so what were you and noel kahn talking about today ?
just telling me about some stupid rumor he had heard .
what kind of rumor ?
the english teacher--
you know , the one that you think is so great ?
he &apos;s having a thing with one of his students .
we were days away from a foreclosure .
this is our lifeline , and i will pay it all back .
well , if the bank finds out about your unauthorized loan ,
that &apos;s like a felony , right ?
it &apos;s only a felony if they find out .
&quot; don &apos;t say i never gave you anything .
turn on your computer . a. &quot;
if the girls knew i was seeing you ,
oh , my god , they &apos;d never shut up about it .
i wish they were more mature , but ...
we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
i have to get back before they wake up .
i know you wanna kiss me .
she doesn &apos;t even look scared .
did alison ever look scared ?
come closer .
he pushed her , didn &apos;t he ?
all that mumbling and groaning ,
maybe she was gripping the ground because she was--
looking for a weapon to defend herself ?
why are you snapping at me ?
i &apos;m just trying to give your creepy brother an out .
in @-@ law , okay ? ian is my creepy brother @-@ in @-@ law .
okay , whatever he is ,
he just married your sister ,
and he might be a killer .
this definitely proves that he was with her the night she died .
can we just watch this video one more time
and figure out what they &apos;re saying ?
no , please . i can &apos;t watch this again .
yeah , em &apos;s right . let &apos;s just give it a rest .
is anybody else freezing ?
i &apos;ll make some hot chocolate .
hot chocolate ? what is this , camp tamarack ?
we can &apos;t just sit around singing kumbaya .
we have to hand over that video .
what video ?
uh , hanna rented tootsie ,
but she left it at home .
oh , well , you &apos;re welcome to hang with us in the barn .
your sister picked some chick flick on demand .
where do we keep the popcorn ?
that drawer .
oh . okay .
oh , emily , by the way , i &apos;ve been meaning to ask you ,
you ready to trade your goggles in for a field hockey stick ?
yeah , we could use some speed on offense .
right , spence ?
mm @-@ hmm .
thanks , i &apos;m still into swimming .
well , you wouldn &apos;t be if you saw
what they skimmed out of that pool every week .
what &apos;s up ? did i walk into the middle of a chick flick ?
okay , i get it-- no guys allowed .
god , that was close .
spencer , how can you even sleep here ,
knowing that he &apos;s living in your backyard ?
we have to give that tape to the police ... tonight .
and when they ask us where we got it ?
forgot the salt .
okay , does this look even ?
earth to hanna .
sorry , what ?
oh , uh , yeah , it &apos;s fine .
okay , remind me , how come
you &apos;re the chair of the decorating committee ,
and we &apos;re the one &apos;s decorating ?
i can &apos;t climb up there .
i &apos;m saving my one good leg for tomorrow night .
hanna , the printer guy needs to be paid .
did you order six baracks and no michelles ?
are you kidding ?
tell him no michelles , no money .
uh , maybe you should tell him .
he says this is what you ordered .
i &apos;ll be right back .
oh , and it &apos;s a little low on the left .
can we just break her other leg ?
hey , are we still doing this at lunch ?
if by &quot; this , &quot; you mean taking your laptop to the police ,
then , yes , we are .
but no one called over there , right ?
they don &apos;t know that we &apos;re coming .
what &apos;s with the cold feet ?
it &apos;s just ...
i was up all night thinking .
what if this is a setup ?
a could &apos;ve planted this video on my laptop ,
knowing that we would turn it in .
guys , let &apos;s not try to second @-@ guess &quot; a. &quot;
we &apos;ve been there . we ended up scared of an old con
who turned out to be just
a jealous freak looking for a better grade .
yeah , let &apos;s not forget &quot; a &quot;
also tried to kill hanna for knowing too much .
we could be walking into a trap .
you are already living in it .
no . ian ... might have done other stuff ,
but he &apos;s not &quot; a. &quot;
there &apos;s no way he &apos;d want us knowing this video even exists .
but it does , and the police need to know
what happened to alison that night .
toby gave alison his sweater before she saw ian ,
and toby shouldn &apos;t go to jail for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
she &apos;s right .
hey , i &apos;ll drive you to the station during lunch .
hey , how &apos;d it go ?
not well .
you know , i should call the shop and get him fired .
how much do you think he makes an hour ?
what you should do is have him sponsor you for the dance .
ask the manager to pony up a couple hundred bucks .
how much have you raised ?
some , not a lot .
your mom &apos;s gonna throw down , though , right ?
of course .
have her pass that at work .
that &apos;s what my mom did .
hey , do you think your mom
would hire me again to work at the dental office ?
oh , i wouldn &apos;t go there .
why not ?
hanna , you threatened a kid with a drill bit .
he aimed at me for rinse @-@ and @-@ spit !
look , if you don &apos;t have enough pledges ,
you can split some of my sponsorship money .
no . no , it &apos;s not that .
it &apos;s just i &apos;m saving up for some earrings .
they &apos;re crazy expensive .
so can you just ask her ? please ?
sure , but if i were you ,
i &apos;d keep looking .
surprise .
simone ? what are you doing here ?
i wanted to surprise you .
she &apos;s in town visiting her parents ,
so i hijacked her .
mom , i don &apos;t need a babysitter anymore .
no , but my first period english class does .
your mom invited me to speak to her classes .
you know , try to convince them that there &apos;s life after rosewood .
and it &apos;s actually a very impressive life .
guess who is now a published author ?
what ? ! that &apos;s fantastic !
okay , okay , slow down .
two short stories and an online journal ,
and your mom thinks i &apos;m j.k. rowling .
mom , why didn &apos;t you tell me simone was coming ?
well , because some of us can keep a secret .
it &apos;s so weird to be back in this building .
i came in and went right into auto @-@ pilot ,
walked straight to my old locker .
oh , don &apos;t tell me you miss it .
i do .
it &apos;s twice the size of my apartment in new york .
well , i mean , do you have to leave
after my mom &apos;s class ?
you should come to mine , too .
hanna , spencer , emily--
we &apos;re all in the same english class .
oh , why didn &apos;t i think of that ? that &apos;s a great idea .
i &apos;ll be right back .
your mom tells me that you kept
quite an intense journal while you were away .
yeah , well , i had to do something .
it was iceland .
the sun went down in october , and it came back up in march .
don &apos;t diss it . there might be a
really good story in there somewhere .
no . no , i doubt it .
and when you win that pulitzer , you better thank me .
i made you turn off the o.c.
and read wuthering heights .
it wasn &apos;t wuthering heights , it was the exorcist .
okay , volume . mother on campus .
okay , so we &apos;re all set .
mr. fitz is in ,
and , simone , you are booked till lunch .
if you have time for a cup of coffee while you &apos;re in town ,
i think he would really like to pick your brain .
say yes . he &apos;s very single and very handsome .
am i wrong ?
yes , i heard what you said , but can i at least--
can i at least say hello to her ?
hello ? hello ?
was that your mom ?
no , maya &apos;s prison guard at true north .
how &apos;s she holding up ?
wouldn &apos;t know . they won &apos;t let me talk to her .
why not ? what do they have her doing over there in those woods ?
building a log cabin ?
building character .
and now they &apos;ve taken her phone away
and reprogrammed it so only her parents can call .
no texts , no emails-- no nothing .
give me your phone .
what ?
give it to me .
you &apos;ll get it back ,
and then you can call your honey 24 @-@ 7 .
what are you looking at ?
not what , who .
that new kid ?
i don &apos;t wanna go there . i heard he &apos;s sketchy .
look , sean gave him 20 bucks ,
he totally upgraded his phone--
more memory , new apps .
he &apos;ll hook you up .
i don &apos;t even know his name .
em , he doesn &apos;t want a &quot; thank you &quot; card , he wants cash .
oh . hey , lucas .
wouldn &apos;t have even recognized her .
when &apos;s the last time you saw simone ? huh ?
oh , i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s been a while .
well , she must be doing pretty well
if she &apos;s willing to sponsor all four of us .
come on , han . you can look at &quot; help wanted &quot; on the way over .
i hear rosewood p.d. is hiring .
well , i do have experience with them ,
just the wrong kind .
okay , come on , we have to go . we only have 45 minutes .
wait , hold on . what &apos;s this ?
what am i looking at ?
how come it shows your music library &apos;s online
when your laptop &apos;s on your shoulder ?
look , isn &apos;t that your playlist ?
what ?
why are you carrying a yearbook ?
i &apos;m not .
where &apos;s your laptop ?
it &apos;s in my bag , except it &apos;s not .
this is insane . this bag
has been plastered to my side all morning .
what about p.e. ?
it was in my gym locker , but no one else has that combo .
the coaches do .
ian must &apos;ve heard us last night .
well , if he did , then he knows what &apos;s on there .
if he has my laptop ...
he knows we &apos;ve seen what &apos;s on there , too .
caleb , wait up .
didn &apos;t you see me wave at you ?
i saw you . you need something ?
my phone-- is it done ?
did you crack the code or not ?
hey , let &apos;s do this monday .
you said it &apos;d be ready today .
i said i would make it happen .
i don &apos;t give dates , all right .
you want speedy delivery , call best buy .
what if i give you 40 more bucks ?
would that make it happen any faster ?
let me put it this way ...
yes .
yo , not here .
walk with me .
so what &apos;s the rush ?
i wanna speak to my friend tonight .
where is she , rehab ?
it &apos;s not rehab , it &apos;s more like ...
who told you it was rehab ?
nice cushy town like this ?
i &apos;m guessing rehad is the new boarding school .
well , it &apos;s not .
she &apos;s not a pothead .
she shouldn &apos;t even be there .
where did you move here from ?
why do you care ?
why can &apos;t you tell me ?
i didn &apos;t say i couldn &apos;t .
it just might cost you an extra 40 bucks .
all right , fine .
i &apos;ll give you a discount .
you can hear my whole life story
for a chili cheese dog .
you don &apos;t have time to eat . you have a deadline .
i chew fast .
susan , i know your inventory back and forth .
if you could just give me one shot .
look , i think you &apos;re terrific , hanna .
if it were up to me , i &apos;d love to hire you ,
but my boss would kill me .
why ?
your mother owes us some money .
um , well , maybe i could work it off .
honey , there are not enough days in the week .
i &apos;m sorry .
how &apos;d it go ? did you get it ?
they said they &apos;d call .
well , someone &apos;s going to hire you eventually .
relax , it &apos;s a pair of earrings .
just ask your mom for a bigger allowance .
can we just go ? please ?
我有份工作给你 -a
is this a bad time ?
no , no , i just , uh ...
i know , i know . it was impulsive .
i should &apos;ve called .
i know that &apos;s our deal ,
but i just figured it &apos;s a saturday morning ,
you got a stack of papers to grade ,
and we &apos;re not really gonna get a chance to talk tonight at the dance .
i wasn &apos;t working .
i was actually reading one of simone &apos;s short stories .
how is it ?
it &apos;s really good . she &apos;s talented .
i figure i should read one before i meet with her ...
for coffee .
so you &apos;re meeting with her now ?
at noon . crap .
it &apos;s 11 : 30 already .
you didn &apos;t mention you were doing this .
well , your mother was pretty persistent ,
and i couldn &apos;t exactly tell her i was seeing someone .
oh , of course .
you &apos;re okay with this , right ?
yeah , why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
i mean , you should be seen out in public
with someone closer to your own age .
it &apos;s just coffee , all right .
no , i know .
so should i just stay here , wait for you till you get back ?
you know , i could just read or clean out your refrigerator .
there &apos;s nothing in it .
well , there &apos;s this .
you should probably go first ,
and i &apos;ll count to 50 .
oh , hey there .
hey .
you haven &apos;t seen my laptop anywhere , have you ?
i &apos;ve got this paper due monday ,
and i can &apos;t find it anywhere .
hmm . i mean , you had it the other night , right ?
weren &apos;t you and your pals looking at it ?
yeah ...
but i thought i brought it with me to school .
but you backup your files , right ?
yeah . yeah , most of it ,
like the important stuff .
well , i haven &apos;t seen it .
maybe it &apos;s in the barn . you &apos;re welcome to check .
oh , okay .
hey , listen , do you want half of this ?
we &apos;re gonna need plenty of energy for tonight .
we ? you &apos;re going to the dance ?
why ?
well , they asked me to chaperone .
yeah , it was either that or spending a night in philly
with melissa and her business school friends .
yeah , school dance felt less painful .
and melissa is okay with that ?
well , yeah , she knows it &apos;s not my scene .
i &apos;m more comfortable here .
or at least i used to be .
why , what &apos;s changed ?
well , you know how it is-- small town , people gossip .
they think they know you , but they don &apos;t .
who exactly are we talking about here ?
listen , spence , what do you say we put the past behind us ?
we &apos;re living under the same roof now .
let &apos;s try and be a family .
you sure you wanna check your purse ?
yeah , why not ?
it &apos;s sloshing .
what do you have in there anyway ?
nothing .
i just brought a little beverage
in case the punch bowl has no punch .
you brought a flask .
jeez , hanna .
at least fold your people magazine around it .
excuse me . bruce , how are you ?
thank you .
hey , how are you ?
you &apos;re sure your laptop &apos;s in that bag ?
well , there &apos;s only one way to find out .
why would he bring it to school
when he knows that we &apos;re all gonna be here ?
maybe he thought you &apos;d bail out early ,
go home and snoop through his things .
why don &apos;t you ?
already did .
we need the bag .
i know you &apos;re all eager to get started ,
but first the rules , all right ?
number one-- there &apos;s no stopping during the dances .
your chaperones will be walking around ,
making sure you &apos;re still moving .
what if he already erased the video ?
well , then we know for sure
he &apos;s hiding something ,
and we go to the police .
with a non @-@ video ?
you think they &apos;re gonna take our word for it ?
look , we saw what we saw .
something went down between him and alison ,
and he buried her in the yard to shut her up .
now let &apos;s get this party started !
oh , hey . i thought you had a faculty dinner .
yeah , i did . it wrapped up early .
so i thought i &apos;d stop by and lend a hand .
it &apos;s not like we need to be avoiding each other , right ?
of course not .
all right then , where do you want me , boss ?
uh , how about the snack table ?
sold .
listen , i &apos;ve been a little out of the loop this week .
what exactly is a dance @-@ a @-@ thon ?
well , you &apos;re sponsoring aria , right ?
yeah , $ 10 a dance .
so if she makes it through 20 dances ,
you need to pony up $ 200
towards her class trip to d.c.
ella , we need you .
snack table &apos;s that way . to be continued .
okay .
please tell me you did not request the backstreet boys ?
simone .
what are you doing here ?
do you not want me here ?
no . i mean , yes , of course i do .
here you are . how awesome is that ?
hey , i didn &apos;t know you were coming to this .
two days in a row ?
are you living in that locker ?
ezra mentioned that he was on the chaperone shift ,
so i decided to stop by .
oh , so you and ezra had a nice time .
he &apos;s terrific .
you &apos;re lucky .
they did not have english teachers like that when i was here .
we &apos;ve gotta get that key .
hey . do you have it ? where is it ?
wait , how much did you charge her ?
it was a rush job .
if you give it away for free , nobody would want it .
i threw in some extra ringtones ... on the house .
well , you should ,
considering you charged her three times the normal amount .
that phone should answer itself
and have a built @-@ in lipstick .
you have a problem ? call customer service .
you &apos;re an ass , okay ? you knew she was desperate ,
and you took advantage of her .
ever heard of suppy and demand ?
oh , always working an angle , aren &apos;t you ?
like you &apos;re not .
you don &apos;t know the first thing about me .
no , you don &apos;t know the first thing about you .
跟卢卡斯跳舞 200块一支 - a
hey , he checked his jacket .
it &apos;s number 62 , and the key ring is in the pocket .
what are you looking at ?
i feel bad .
no one &apos;s asking lucas to dance .
he &apos;s used to it .
well , so was i 40 pounds ago ,
but you were nice enough to make me feel included .
no comparison , you were sweet .
this kid &apos;s looking to get bitch slapped every time he opens his mouth .
hey , it &apos;s just a dance .
you wanna pick a charity ? save a whale .
one dance ?
ready for a dance break ?
i &apos;m working .
obama will still be in office by the time you get back . come on .
i &apos;m sure you can find somebody else to step on your feet .
lucas , you &apos;ve been treating me like a beg bug for weeks .
we came here for a good cause and to have fun .
why can &apos;t we have fun ? i love this song .
i hate this song .
you love this song .
you &apos;re right , i love this song .
well , come on , let &apos;s bust a move . let &apos;s go .
should i call you tomorrow ?
sure .
maybe monday ?
no , no , i understand .
okay .
i miss you .
bye .
hey , was that maya ?
how is she ?
amazing .
she seems really ...
happy .
so why don &apos;t you ?
me ? no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m good . it &apos;s all good .
i &apos;m not sensing good here , emily .
what &apos;s wrong ? what happened ?
it &apos;s just weird .
it was like she was there , but she wasn &apos;t .
oh , sweety .
she &apos;s in wilderness boot camp .
you know , she &apos;s been talking to bears .
and besides , i bet her counselor was probably watching her the whole time .
no , she was alone .
maybe she &apos;s moved on .
what made you choose prague ?
i figured if you &apos;re gonna spend a semester abroad ,
you might as well do it where they sell absinthe .
ever been to one of those crazy
marionette shows they have over there ?
oh , yeah , yeah . why do you think they sell absinthe ?
hey .
uh , do you need your jacket ?
you &apos;re not punking out on the marathon already , are you ?
oh , talk about somebody who loves their puppets .
remember that huge cookie monster you had on your bed ?
you slept with him every night .
uh , no , don &apos;t really remember .
how could you forget ?
he had to be peeled off of you in the morning .
you slept with him in between your legs .
actually , it was my ankles .
can i get coat 62 ?
my dad left something in his pocket .
thanks .
thanks .
all right .
wait .
why ?
just one more dance .
i like this song , too .
you came here with sean . remember him ?
big guy , likes to hit me ?
shh . just dance .
hey . why aren &apos;t you dancing ?
bathroom break .
mom , how long does simone plan on staying here ?
i don &apos;t know . she and mr. fitz seem to be hitting it off .
well , i think she &apos;s making a fool of herself .
why ?
because she &apos;s going after what she wants ?
some men find that appealing .
i think i know what &apos;s going on here .
you &apos;re jealous .
what ?
why would you say that ?
honey , she &apos;s your old babysitter ,
and she &apos;s your friend ,
and she &apos;s spending more time
with mr. fitz than you ,
but , aria , you gotta cut her some slack .
you know , it &apos;s hard to meet nice guys .
sometimes you gotta strike while the iron &apos;s hot .
you &apos;ll understand one day .
um , just keep dancing , okay ? i &apos;ll be right back .
but this is a slow song .
well , sway .
i &apos;ll just be a second .
what &apos;s up ?
what &apos;s up ?
you said one dance . it &apos;s been five .
no , i know , but for the first couple , we were just talking ,
and this is the first one he &apos;s actually gotten into .
oh , yeah , i know what he &apos;s into .
you .
okay , stop .
this is a marathon , not a sprint .
there &apos;ll be plenty of dances for us .
hanna , i spent most of homecoming
standing around and waiting for you .
do you bring me to these things just to ditch me ?
don &apos;t answer that .
sean .
no , i mean it .
if you &apos;re trying to piss me off , it &apos;s working .
look , i have to check this .
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s important .
yeah .
跟卢卡斯跳舞 500美元每支 -a
need some help with that ?
i--i was ...
i was just looking for--
a chainsaw ?
i can pick that for you if you want .
could you close that door please ?
feeling a draft ?
this is way too complicated for me to explain right now .
what &apos;s complicated ?
i don &apos;t live in a cave , i get it .
the rich girls steal , the pretty girls lie ,
the smart girls play dumb ,
and the dumb girls spend
their days trying to be all of the above .
how much will it cost to make you forget that you walked in here ?
well , four hours down , two to go .
did you ask him to play this ?
no , i wish that i had , though .
listen , as long as it &apos;s playing ...
we should take simone out
to that little pizza joint we used to love .
you , me , the kids ... it &apos;ll be like old times .
it &apos;s still there .
oh , no , i know .
and the kids would probably really enjoy that .
i &apos;m just not so sure i need to be there .
but then it wouldn &apos;t be like old times , would it ?
no , you &apos;re right .
it would be like new times .
it &apos;s just ... it &apos;s just a pizza , ella .
yeah , but it comes with a lot of toppings .
let &apos;s not confuse things right now , okay ?
let &apos;s just dance .
so then i couldn &apos;t get into the drawer . none of the keys worked .
what did this kid see ?
did you have to pay him off or something ?
no , he wouldn &apos;t take any money ,
but i think he &apos;ll keep his mouth shut .
it &apos;s not like he doesn &apos;t have plenty to hide .
right ? aria ?
that is it ! i will kick her back to new york if i have to !
wait , aria , stop , before you do something you regret .
spence , let go of me .
i &apos;d be happy to pass your stuff along .
really ?
mm @-@ hmm , sure .
my editor is coming over for a drink next weekend .
you should join us .
there are teachers here and parents--your parents !
i don &apos;t care !
it &apos;s just a train ride away
and a 15 @-@ minute walk from penn station .
we need to talk .
what &apos;s going on ?
mr. fitz ...
will you dance with me ?
what ?
we &apos;re allowed . come on .
someone &apos;s crushing on her english teacher .
my feet hurt . my brain hurts .
everything hurts .
scoot over .
hey , where &apos;d you get that ?
this is mine .
i helped myself .
to all of it ?
why are you dancing with lucas ?
what do you mean ?
you &apos;re torturing him .
you know he worships you ,
and you &apos;re never gonna look at him that way .
i already feel like crap , okay ?
so if you &apos;re gonna pile it on ,
you could &apos;ve at least saved me a sip .
alison did the same thing to me .
makes you feel powerful , huh ?
no .
just the opposite .
it &apos;s too bad she &apos;s not here tonight .
alison would &apos;ve been really proud of you .
最后一支舞 1000美元
what the hell was that about ?
saving your relationship .
five more seconds , and you would &apos;ve ended up on youtube .
that was a suicide mission , and you know it .
look , hanna , i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to lose it .
let &apos;s just forget it and dance , okay ?
look , i--i can &apos;t .
can &apos;t or won &apos;t ?
look , i have to dance with lucas .
please don &apos;t ask why .
just let me dance with him .
oh . okay , sure . and you know what ?
you can do more than dance with him .
you can leave with him , too .
no , sean , please .
that car broke more than your legs .
there &apos;s something really sick going on up there .
we &apos;re over .
is everything okay ?
do you wanna go outside and talk ?
no , just dance with me .
what is going on with emily ?
come on . hey , sit down .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go get you some water .
caffeinated water .
i &apos;m not thirsty .
he shouldn &apos;t be here .
he &apos;s not a chaperone . he &apos;s a killer .
emily .
why is toby at home wearing a lojack ,
while this freak can go anywhere he wants ,
do whatever he wants ...
emily--
marry your sister ? !
okay , emily , with us . come on .
i know what you did-- we all know--
and you &apos;re not gonna get away with it .
emily .
aria can handle that .
what are you doing ?
you and i are gonna dance .
what was she talking about ?
i--i don &apos;t know .
and i think you do .
she knows about us .
she knows we kissed last summer .
well , i thought we agreed we were gonna keep that a secret .
who else knows besides your little friends ?
no one .
that better be the truth or someone is gonna get hurt .
was that tree always here ?
here , take these . she &apos;s not driving .
no , i &apos;m not taking her home .
if her mom finds out it was my flask ,
i &apos;m gonna be feeding the bears with maya .
fine , i &apos;ll drive her .
no , i &apos;m not going home .
just crash at my place then , okay ?
you , too .
i don &apos;t wanna be home alone when ian walks in .
okay .
hanna .
can i take you home ?
you know , i kinda promised them--
look ...
i know sean took off ,
and i was thinking that since you guys were now over ...
i can open my own damn door .
lucas , it &apos;s really , really sweet of you to offer ,
but emily &apos;s kind of ...
she needs me right now ,
and i already told spencer i &apos;d go with them , so ...
okay .
if you want , you should just leave with simone .
take her home to new york .
why would you think i &apos;d want --
well , why wouldn &apos;t you ?
she &apos;s beautiful , and she &apos;s smart and funny .
i met her yesterday .
she &apos;s successful . you love her writing .
she &apos;s your age .
i can &apos;t-- i can &apos;t compete with that .
nobody &apos;s asking you to .
yeah , but it &apos;s true . you two even look like a couple .
you can dance with her
and hold her hand in front of other people ,
leave your apartment at
the same time without having to count to 50 .
aria ...
why are we having this conversation ?
i &apos;m ...
i am already in love with someone else .
who are you calling ?
maya .
give it back .
friends don &apos;t let friends dial drunk .
you &apos;ll thank me tomorrow ,
if you can remember my name .
now , sit , lie , sleep .
if you need anything , we &apos;ll be right downstairs .
hanna ...
those things i said to you in the courtyard ...
don &apos;t apologize . you were right .
the truth is , i was worse than alison tonight ,
if that &apos;s even possible .
and i do know how lucas feels about me .
i wasn &apos;t messing with him for fun . i had to .
hey , how is she ?
passed out . she wanted to call maya ,
so i took her phone .
smart , that could cause some serious damage .
spence ?
was this always sitting here ?
no .
ian must have put it back before the dance .
well , then why didn &apos;t you notice it ?
he left after me .
the video &apos;s gone ,
and the trash has been wiped .
surprise , surprise .
oh , my god . it &apos;s ali .
what ? what is it ?
&quot; watch your backs . i didn &apos;t . a. &quot;
that was taken in your yard
the night she disappeared .
she &apos;s wearing the yellow top .
there &apos;s a shadow right there like someone was following her .
spence , you know who that is ?
i--i have no idea .
here you go . you have everything ?
okay . bye .
hi . number 32 coming right up .
here you go .
hope you had a good time tonight .
