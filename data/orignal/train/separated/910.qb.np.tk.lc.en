back in the &apos; 80s , game shows ruled the tv .
there was &quot; pyramid , &quot; &quot; wheel of fortune , &quot;
&quot; jeopardy ! , &quot; and &quot; the newlywed game . &quot;
but to us kids , none came close to &quot; double dare . &quot;
it was the world &apos;s best game show ,
filled with trivia , physical challenges ,
and host marc summers ,
who managed to smile even when his nice suits got messy .
idiots !
the flag is under the giant pad of butter !
always look under the butter .
if we ever get on this show ,
imagine all the prizes we &apos;d win .
we &apos;d be strutting around in our brand @-@ new british knights ,
jammin &apos; out to our panasonic portable sound system ,
as we chow down on a year &apos;s supply of chef boyardee .
it &apos;s all our dreams wrapped into one .
but the coolest part -- it was filmed in philly ,
which meant one thing .
all right . shut your giggle holes .
i have two announcements .
first , whoever wrote my phone number in the boys &apos; bathroom
will be found .
i called and asked if his refrigerator was running .
it wasn &apos;t , so it ended up being sad .
second , some game show called &quot; double dare &quot;
is holding auditions at our school ,
and two of you will be picked to be on their show .
now let &apos;s get those bodies tv @-@ ready .
dude , this is seriously the best day of my life ,
and i once got mistaken for
mary lou retton .
dorothy hamill .
we &apos;re actually gonna be on &quot; double dare . &quot;
you two so have this in the bag .
bro , you don &apos;t have a prayer .
shut up , dave kim . this face was made for tv .
but that voice -- youch .
you two can &apos;t compete with handsome ben .
he was right .
we all had one growing up --
the vicious rival who always won .
who always beats you out for class president ?
handsome ben .
and who always gets the lead in the musical ?
handsome ben .
who was first in line to see &quot; temple of doom &quot; ?
handsome ben .
you had to sit in the second row ,
like a chump .
fine ! you &apos;re right ! he wins every time .
but this will be different .
will it ?
look at him .
hey , a.g. hey , dave kim .
hi , ben .
hey , buddy .
you &apos;re right . he &apos;s amazing .
my only real shot is to win over the producers
by picking a partner that &apos;ll make me stand out .
perhaps someone like ...
&quot; cute dave kim . &quot;
no one calls you that .
i was thinking pops .
your grandfather ?
nothing wins people over more than an adorable old man .
handsome ben is going down .
kid won &apos;t know what hit him .
it was fall 1980 @-@ something ,
and barry and my dad were sitting down
to what they did every sunday --
watch the eagles ...
go , baby , go , baby , go !
... for better or worse .
fumble ? ! no !
that &apos;s it . season &apos;s over .
it &apos;s the first game of the year .
they already blew it .
we got to fire the coach
and start thinking about next year .
whenever they &apos;d watch , my dad would turn on the team ,
while my brother was hopelessly positive .
look , all we need is a turnover , a touchdown ,
a 2 @-@ point conversion , an onside kick ,
and two more touchdowns .
or 12 safeties .
turn it off ! i can &apos;t take it anymore .
and they each handled an eagles loss in their own special way .
hey , buddy . got you a new burger flipper .
i noticed your old spatula was a little worse for wear .
look at you . always so damn nice , huh ?
well , i &apos;m sick of it .
lashing out because the eagles lost ?
and i &apos;m sick of your face .
i &apos;ll just leave this and go .
i will kill you with this spatula ,
you thoughtful , thoughtful man !
as for my brother , an eagles loss meant
several heartbroken days of utter depression .
hey . hugh hefner . cover your downstairs stuff .
you &apos;re in school , not the grotto .
the eagles lost .
take the day .
make room , everybody ! eagles fan coming through !
thankfully , a new week meant a new chance
for my dad and bro to help the eagles win --
through a series of crazy superstitions .
let &apos;s get this going .
i got on my good @-@ luck jersey and underpants .
now time for some pregame cabbage patching
to supercharge our good luck .
even if the superstitions
breached the boundary of common sense .
do it better ! the eagles need us !
or any sense at all .
who wants some double @-@ cheesy nachos ?
stop where you &apos;re at !
mom , you know the rules !
once you step foot on the den floor , the eagles will lose .
what happens in this house has no impact on the game .
that is adorable .
i am not bad luck .
would you just stop with this already ?
what happened the first sunday after we got married ,
when you insisted on watching the game with me ?
they lost by six stupid touchdowns .
just come and get your nachos .
mom , you know the rules .
once the game starts , we can &apos;t move from our spot .
now truck it over on the animal .
this &apos; 80s toy monster truck was their typical lifeline ,
mostly due to its retractable claws for stability .
the claws did nothing !
stay back ! don &apos;t clean it up !
there &apos;s hot cheese on my rug !
that &apos;s its home now !
she jinxed us !
do your idiot dance !
pops , i have amazing news !
you &apos;re gonna be my partner on &quot; double dare &quot; !
that &apos;s the best news i &apos;ve heard all day .
also , what &apos;s &quot; double dare &quot; ?
only the country &apos;s hottest game show .
you love game shows , right ?
you bet .
that vanna white sure can turn a letter .
don &apos;t say any of that at our audition .
in fact , leave all the talking to me .
you sure you don &apos;t want to do this with one of your little friends ?
nah . she &apos;ll understand .
you punched me in the heart !
you &apos;re picking your grandfather over me ? seriously ?
you know it &apos;s been my dream to go on &quot; double dare . &quot;
it &apos;s selfish of you not to support that .
how am i the weak link ?
you got flat feet and a lazy eye .
that &quot; double dare &quot; human @-@ hamster wheel will eat you alive .
i had no choice .
this is the only way
i can beat my lifelong rival , handsome ben .
dude , you &apos;re not his rival . it &apos;s totally one @-@ sided .
oh , yeah ? watch this .
hey , ben .
&apos;sup , adam ?
good luck at the &quot; double dare &quot; tryouts .
i hope you get it .
stupid , generous handsome ben .
well , i don &apos;t need you .
i &apos;m gonna make it on the show and win ,
and i won &apos;t save any slime for you !
is that a new trapper keeper , adam ?
sweet .
just got it . thanks .
i will bury you .
while i was plotting to beat my lifelong rival ,
my mom had plotted a way into the den .
what -- what is this ? what are you doing ?
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not touching the floor .
i &apos;m just gonna bust some dust and be on my way .
poop !
bevy , please ! come on !
dear lord , no !
and then something crazy happened .
the eagles intercepted the moment my mom stepped on the floor .
and as soon as she left ...
come on !
are you kidding ?
... the eagles fumbled .
dude . did you see that ?
when mom was in here , the eagles kicked butt .
the second she left , the eagles sucked butt .
what are you saying ?
do you think mom &apos;s good luck ?
no . it &apos;s just a dumb coincidence .
only one way to find out .
what the hell ? !
shut up . shut up .
mom ! i think dad spilled something !
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ve always got a rag .
it &apos;s a mom secret .
they sacked bradshaw .
get it ! get it ! get it !
... and they did .
good god , mom did it !
no ! that was just another coincidence .
you keep your mother out of this . understand ?
understand what ? i heard &quot; mother . &quot;
i &apos;m the mother . here i am .
dude , all these years , we &apos;ve got it wrong .
you &apos;re not a jinx .
you &apos;re like a real , actual lucky charm .
thank you , schmoo .
no . stop .
there &apos;s no such thing as actual luck .
then why are you wearing your lucky jersey and underpants ?
this helps the eagles win , not your mother .
looks like those greeny guys are celebrating something .
they scored !
mom stays -- stays forever .
this is gonna be fun !
go , greeny birds !
no .
we have a system when we watch football ,
and the number @-@ one rule of that system is &quot; no talking . &quot;
naturally , my mom respected the rules --
until the next week , when she didn &apos;t .
are the players married to the cheerleaders ?
do you think their families are mad
&apos;cause they work on sundays ?
look at those grass stains . who washes those pants ? !
aren &apos;t we all patriots ?
look at that big , snuggly pileup .
why does the throwy guy keep putting his hands
in the other guy &apos;s butt ?
i have a better name for a team --
the yankee doodles .
you know what ? who wants bagel bites ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna put some in the oven .
what do i set it at -- 2,000 ?
no ! murray , you know the rule .
don &apos;t touch any knobs in the kitchen .
hey ! come back fast . we need you on defense .
isn &apos;t this great ?
woman &apos;s got to go .
what ? no ! she &apos;s part of the game ritual .
there &apos;s no going back .
a man needs time away from his wife ,
and for me , football is that time .
so , what ? you &apos;re just gonna tell her to go away ?
you know mom . it &apos;ll crush her .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll be sensitive .
hey , honey .
would you put that down and get out ?
what ? !
listen , it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t love spending every moment with you ,
but you don &apos;t understand football ,
and it &apos;s distracting .
well , that sounds like an excuse .
okay , imagine if i go to your scrapbook club
and every few seconds ,
i interrupt you with a question
about what glitter i should use .
well , that would be ridiculous
because there &apos;s opaque , translucent , chunky ,
micro @-@ fine , spray @-@ on , brush @-@ on ... squeeze @-@ on --
i get it .
i &apos;ll go .
that means a lot , bevy .
and that &apos;s how you do marriage .
and so my mom got the message .
teach me everything about football .
you &apos;ve come to the right place .
it was just the wrong message .
let &apos;s start with the basics . this is the quarterback .
these are the linemen , receivers , running back .
question --
what do all those words mean ?
simplifying , there &apos;s offense and defense .
question -- are those things i should already know ?
simplifying ...
this is a football .
question --
is the plural of &quot; football &quot; &quot; feetball &quot; ?
ohh ! god !
why won &apos;t anyone answer me ? what are you people hiding ?
my god . i can &apos;t take this anymore .
look , there is only one way to teach mom anything --
put it in terms she understands .
okay , this is a football ,
but i want you to imagine it &apos;s actually me as a baby .
now , your job is to protect that baby at all costs .
of course .
who are they ?
hi , erica ! you called , and i came right away .
isn &apos;t that nice of me ?
as you can see , they &apos;re the enemy .
we call them the defensive line .
their job is to stop you .
translation -- they &apos;re a band of evil college recruiters ,
wanting to take your precious little girl away
to ... an out @-@ of @-@ state university .
but that &apos;s too far . how will i see you every day ?
you &apos;ve only got one choice -- get that baby back to our house .
or the end zone .
please move .
no way .
please move !
oh , we &apos;re comin &apos; for you .
gimme that baby !
never !
hike !
go ! go !
go , go , go , go , go ! go , go , go !
i made it home !
i made it home .
or the end zone .
oh ! i get it !
come on , guys . where &apos;s the &quot; d &quot; ?
i just don &apos;t know where to touch her .
maybe i should just cover erica .
i hate you so much , geoff .
shut it , okay ? it &apos;s enough .
while my mom was ready for game day ,
i was ready for my game @-@ show debut .
hi , kids . i &apos;m zane , and this is ellen .
we &apos;ve set up a practice course
to simulate actual &quot; double dare . &quot;
now pick a partner .
that &apos;s right . let &apos;s get messy !
yep , i knew exactly how to wow the producers .
three words -- make an entrance .
sorry we &apos;re late .
me and my best friend got held up on the public bus .
no way . you can &apos;t pick a cute old man .
that &apos;s not fair .
sorry , sister -- not against the rules .
i checked .
what kind of a farkakte game show is this ?
i thought it was just trivia .
oh , it is -- and some physical challenges .
it looks slimy and unsafe .
you &apos;re pops ! you can do anything !
what the is that thing ?
you play tennis and date twins
and drink martinis when the sun &apos;s out .
yes , i do sample from the salad bar of life .
then let &apos;s show &apos; em what we &apos;re made of .
go , go , go ! you got it .
i can &apos;t find the damn flag .
look under the pad of butter !
they always hide it under the pad of butter !
aw , there &apos;s no flag here !
this is my good tracksuit !
why am i here ?
oh , no , no !
this is not a game show !
faster !
po--
i &apos;m not a hamster ! i &apos;m a human man !
that ... did not go well .
no , it did not .
i &apos;m sorry i let you down , kiddo .
i &apos;m gonna dig my watch out of the butter and leave .
well , how &apos;d it go with your adorable best friend ?
great . so great .
listen , i was thinking --
our friendship is too important .
we should be partners .
i don &apos;t think so .
see , i already got a partner .
you ready to rock , muscles ?
seriously ?
of all the people , you ditch me for that putz ?
now you know how it feels .
well , we &apos;ll see how you feel when handsome ben chokes .
he &apos;s got the looks , but not the chops .
done .
and i got the course record , too .
balls !
that is one hard schnoz .
as i was losing a best friend ...
set ... hike !
... my mom was learning how to win at feetball .
touchdown !
oh , yeah !
you &apos;re in my house now !
you &apos;re gonna come in and take off your shoes
&apos;cause i just vacuumed .
that &apos;s how &quot; in my house &quot; you are !
i think our work here is done .
i have a feeling your dad is gonna be a very happy man !
let &apos;s go , eagles &quot; d &quot; !
sack !
yes !
yes , baby .
turns out learning football just ruined it for my dad .
isn &apos;t this great ?
mur , you got it all .
yeah , she did the thing i asked her to do ,
so it &apos;d be wrong of me to complain .
watch -- next play , they &apos;re gonna throw the long ball .
that &apos;s nuts . it &apos;s third and short .
they &apos;re gonna go up the middle .
no . they &apos;re expecting the rush .
stop saying things with sports @-@ fueled knowledge !
let &apos;s all just not talk until the eagles win , okay ?
unfortunately for my dad , they really were expecting the rush .
who called it ?
mama bird -- that &apos;s who !
face !
aah ! that &apos;s it !
you got to go .
go ? !
but ...
i learned football .
i did what you said .
thing is , i lied .
look , i think the key to a good marriage is time apart ,
and for me , football is that time .
well , i think the key to a good marriage
is spending time together .
but if you don &apos;t want me here ...
i &apos;ll go .
while my &quot; double dare &quot; dreams had been dashed ,
emmy &apos;s were looking better than ever ,
thanks to athletic , horrible handsome ben .
look at handsome ben go .
his feet barely touch the slime .
i feel like it &apos;s right ...
here .
yes ! yes ! got it ! come on .
well done , kids !
looks like you two are the team to beat .
couldn &apos;t ask for a better partner .
i think that was directed at you .
yes ! thank you , dave kim .
looks like all of those months of practice with emmy
really paid off .
whoa , whoa , whoa ! months ?
yeah , we overheard coach mellor at the beginning of the year
saying &quot; double dare &quot; was coming .
that &apos;s when we agreed to partner up and -- - what ? !
handsome ben &apos;s just confused .
let me get this straight .
you picked him before i even asked you ?
kinda .
you &apos;ve been torturing me for a week ,
and you did the exact same thing !
i was at least gonna lie and let you down easy .
well , you make a great team --
handsome ben and &quot; sack of crap &quot; emmy .
take it back , nerd !
sure , it was an honest accident .
however , what happened next wasn &apos;t .
after that , no one was at their best .
both of you -- out !
but you said i was a lock .
that was before you made a mess of this course .
now go .
thanks a lot .
well ... looks like you &apos;re gonna need a new partner .
for sure .
hey , amy , be my partner ?
definitely . you &apos;re handsome .
dave kim -- always a bridesmaid .
my dad knew he needed to make it right with my mom .
only problem -- he had no idea how .
time to cook the steak @-@ umms !
hope i don &apos;t make a mess !
why are you narrating your kitchen experience ?
i &apos;m trying to lure your mother downstairs .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong . this always works .
yeah , well , you really hurt her feelings .
you &apos;re a , uh , lady person .
how do i un @-@ hurt them ?
hello ? mom took an interest in something you love .
just show her that you can do the same thing .
what -- like yakking on the phone , shopping ,
or pushing the hot thing over the clothes ?
ironing ?
no , those are chores .
i &apos;m talking about stuff that makes her happy ,
like jazzercise .
that dancy thing where she puts on the stretchy clothes
and rolls around on the ground like a drunk toddler ?
good point . you should focus on something more your speed .
and by &quot; speed , &quot; i mean no speed .
i got it .
son of a bitch !
this can &apos;t be done ! no one can do it !
what exactly are you doing ?
scrapbooking -- your mother &apos;s favorite hobby .
but it &apos;s a nightmare !
stupid glue !
everything i touch sticks to me !
just calm down , okay ? i &apos;m sure what you made is fine .
holy crap ! what is that ?
our sweet memories .
why did you cut out the letters ?
it looks like a ransom note .
you know i &apos;m not good at penmanship !
why &apos;d you put &quot; look &quot; ?
what am i supposed to look at -- his red demon eyes ?
i was trying to make them sparkle with glitter ,
but no one tells you how complicated glitter is .
it looks like something
a 10 @-@ year @-@ old serial killer would make .
i know !
let me break this down for you in terms you understand .
imagine this page is the football field
and this baby picture -- the quarterback .
as erica was coaching my dad ,
coach mellor had the &quot; double dare &quot; results .
all right , listen up .
i just found out who got picked for the game show
that left all sorts of stains on my gym floor .
and our new tv stars are ...
... handsome ben and regular amy .
we &apos;re in ! we did it !
yes !
wait -- what ?
turns out losing out on &quot; double dare &quot;
isn &apos;t nearly as bad as losing your best friend .
i &apos;m not talking to you , jackass .
that should &apos;ve been me .
it should &apos;ve been us .
there is no us .
look , i don &apos;t blame you for picking ben two months ago .
he &apos;s not my rival .
he &apos;s just amazing .
i guess ...
i &apos;m a jackass , too .
little bit .
so much for always having each other &apos;s backs .
i mean , &quot; double dare &quot; tore us apart .
so fast .
are we , like , terrible best friends ?
maybe .
but if we are ,
i hope we &apos;re terrible best friends forever .
i &apos;m talking graduation , college , law school .
hell , i &apos;m gonna be the bro of honor at your wedding .
and when you &apos;re like 100 and at an old @-@ age home ,
i &apos;m gonna be watching &quot; double dare &quot;
right there next to you .
you think it &apos;ll still be on ?
oh , for sure .
i made you something .
what is this ?
i know how hard you worked learning my favorite thing ,
so i thought it was time i learned about yours .
you made a scrapbook for me ?
pretty good , huh ?
no . it &apos;s a train wreck .
you glittered where you should &apos;ve laced ,
and you laced where you should &apos;ve stenciled .
it &apos;s all so complicated !
doesn &apos;t matter .
i love it .
look , i &apos;m lucky to have a wife
who wants to spend time with a man like me .
so what do you say ...
next time , i tag along to your scrapbook club ?
you were right .
scrapbooking is my time away .
you just stick with your feetball .
with that , my parents decided
to give each other some space --
until the eagles fumbled .
that &apos;s it . season &apos;s over .
no , all we need &apos;s a touchdown ,
an onside kick , a field goal ,
and then two more touchdowns .
stop it .
off to the craft store . be back in a jiff .
no , no , no ! wait , wait , wait !
come here , come here , come here , come here .
i think the eagles could use some of your luck .
that &apos;s the thing about the relationships that matter most .
sure , they get messy , and sometimes you fumble ,
but when you &apos;re a team , you always win .
ben and amy , on what tv series
does andy griffith regularly play a lawyer ?
&quot; matlock . &quot;
yes , right again .
you have another $ 10 .
guess we should call her &quot; smart amy . &quot;
ben and amy , on what tv series
does andy griffith regularly play a lawyer ?
&quot; matlock . &quot;
yes , right again .
aah ! it never ends !
come on , big tasty ! dig deep !
goldberg ! what the hell are you doing ? !
