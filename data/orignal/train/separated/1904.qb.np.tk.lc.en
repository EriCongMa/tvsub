lenny shulte , captain of ladder company 54 .
unconscious at the scene with a g.c.s. of 13 .
b.p. &apos; s been constantly dropping .
last was 85 over 60 .
i can &apos;t ... get ... a good ... breath .

i don &apos;t know .
last thing i remember , helping the old lady out of her house .

i &apos;ll check .
5818 shore drive . and my guys--
i @-@ i got 12 guys out there .
turn him . turn him !

owen and i ...
oh , you know , i don &apos;t even know what to call it .

okay .
oh , i &apos;m gonna go to sleep .
oh , just for , like , 20 minutes .
oh , robbins cheating on callie ?
oh ! did not see that coming .
i know .
and &quot; bailey &quot; is a good name .
but two baileys ? you don &apos;t think it &apos;s gonna be confusing ?
no , because ... if i say , &quot; bailey peed on me , &quot;
i think it &apos;s safe to assume that i &apos;m talking about my son .
very good . seriously , wake me in 20 ?
okay .
thank you .
i feel like i &apos;m gonna die .
shepherd ?
yeah , lydia ashford . injuries to the upper extremities .
my house .
and she &apos;s worried about her house .
wait . uh , 5818 shore drive ?
yes . is it gone ?
i don &apos;t know .
uh , karev , kepner &apos;s in trauma one .
get her to tell her patient 5818 shore drive made it .
kepner !
tell your guy 5818 is out .
i could &apos;ve done that .
i &apos;m sorry , but i need a neuro consult in bay 7 .
the guy &apos;s unconscious , but he &apos;s stable .
look what i found in outpatient surgery .
ross , stay here . i paged brooks .
have her get mrs. ashford a pan scan
of the head , neck , chest , and abdomen .
well , i can take her .
no , have brooks do it .
uh , the mayor &apos;s on the phone ,
wants to know about casualties from the mudslide .
i told him it was soon to tell ,
but he wants to hear it from you .
hey , um , go find dr. webber .
i &apos;m supposed to give dr. brooks a message from dr. shepherd .
uh , is that life @-@ threatening ?
because not having enough general surgeons
in here right now is life @-@ threatening .
go find webber .
have you seen dr. webber ?
uh , last time i saw him was after surgery .
he went to go check on the generator .
where &apos;s that ?
how the hell should i know ?
lidocaine and a bunch of 4x4s .
can you take that to hunt ? i got paged by shepherd .
uh ... he wants you to go find webber .
are you sure ? he just paged me 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 2 .
that &apos;s our special little code .
it means more emergent than 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 . get it ?
all i know is they need webber here ,
and shepherd wants you to get him .
apparently , he went to deal with the generator .
and i &apos;m walking toward the car ,
and suddenly the hillside just goes ...
and i &apos;m falling .
i see my squad car coming down on top of me ,
so i managed to roll out of the way ,
but my ... my leg was caught under it .
can you salvage it ?
i think so . we &apos;ll get ortho down here .
i &apos;m gonna take a look
at that nasty laceration on your neck , though .
it &apos;s a lot of embedded debris .
hey , tilden ? everyone make it out of the mud ?
everyone &apos;s accounted for except lauenstein ,
phil g , and brian .
brian &apos;s my fiance ?
don &apos;t worry . you know him . he &apos;s gonna be fine .
look , he &apos;s probably giving himself a mud facial .
you know , look good for the wedding .
yeah , well , if he had cold feet ,
he shoulda just said so .
dr. webber ?
dr. webber !
oh , crap . dr. webber !
oscar hallis .
shepherd says he &apos;s probably concussed .
we &apos;re gonna do a head c.t.
i &apos;m more concerned about infection .
that is a nasty cut on his leg .
well , dr. wilson &apos;s irrigating it with saline .
but we couldn &apos;t find any bacitracin ,
we &apos;re gonna hang some ampicillin .
no ampicillin ! he &apos;s allergic to penicillin .
how do you know ?
what the hell ?
military trick .
someone triaged him at the scene--
probably whoever dug him out .
substitute cefazolin and keep a close eye for allergic reaction .
all right . get some cefazolin .
we don &apos;t have it .
well , find it .
people , check your patients for vitals
written in sharpie on their body .
someone at the scene knew what they were doing .
might &apos;ve just saved this guy &apos;s life .
oh . sharpie here , too .
and it indicates he &apos;s getting worse fast .
his b.p. was better in the field . crap .
okay , we need to stabilize his pelvis .
okay , you &apos;re gonna need to pull harder .
talk to me , murphy .
aaron garcia .
c.t. showed an open book pelvic fracture
on a liver lac with hemorrhage .
harder , murphy .
i &apos;m afraid if i pull too hard , i &apos;m gonna make it worse .
you can &apos;t--move . can &apos;t make it worse .
it &apos;s already as bad as it can be .
all right , i need to get this guy upstairs
and put on an ex fix immediately .
murphy , book an o.r.
and ask bailey to scrub in .
what do you need bailey for ?
he has a liver lac . i need a general surgeon .
well , i &apos;m a general surgeon , and it &apos;s all hands on deck--
get me bailey !
do you have cefazolin ?
yeah , they were hoarding it in o.b.
bastards . give me some .
ahh ! i &apos;ll trade you for a chest tube .
and a granola bar .
i don &apos;t have a granola bar .
liar .
you &apos;ve got granola bar breath .
do you want the cef ?
fine ! yeah .
what is going on out there ?
huge mudslide . gotta go .
lot of crush injuries . super cute baby .
i thought the e.r. was closed !
where &apos;s brooks ?
uh , she was busy , so i went ahead and did the scan .
it shows a small subarachnoid hemorrhage .
her exam ?
uh , neuro checks have been stable .
all right , tell brooks i want her to continue on
with q 1 hour neuro checks .
but--

preventing you from breathing well ,
so we &apos;re gonna insert a chest tube
which should help you breathe better .

i know that you wanted bailey , but she &apos;s working on richard .
callie , we should--

because this guy deserves that .

potassium &apos;s 4.5 . bicarb 18 .
everything else is normal .
lactate .

his girth is increasing as we stand here .

i know what it says , but it &apos;s wrong .
redo it .
all right , uh , charge again to 200 .
clear .
karev ? what &apos;s going on with richard ?
uh , echo shows very little heart activity ,
and c.v.p. &apos; s elevated .
yang &apos;s about to set up for a balloon pump .
all right , well , if we &apos;re sending him up to surgery ,
let &apos;s make sure we have an adequate blood supply for transfusion .
on it .
if--if you need to go deal with more dire patients ,
i get it . go . i &apos;m fine .
actually , you &apos;re not , sasha . it &apos;s important that
we go ahead and debde and clean out this wound
as soon as possible to prevent infection .
sasha ... are you supposed to be walking around in that thing ?
i can &apos;t sit still .
i &apos;m waiting on plastic surgery to sew me up .
that &apos;s this guy .
you mind if i , uh , if i sit here ?
that kinda looks like brian &apos;s handwriting .
yeah , i know . my glasses got knocked off in the slide .
i could barely see a thing , but it could &apos;ve been .
but was it his voice ?
i can &apos;t remember . i &apos;m sorry , sash .
i was kinda out of it , you know ?
i &apos;m sorry .
just a little discoloration in the tissue .
i &apos;d like to run a few tests
just to make sure there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
i &apos;m just gonna numb you up , okay ?

webber and brooks are down . they were electrocuted .
it &apos;s bad , but we &apos;re--we &apos;re-- we &apos;re--we &apos;re dealing with it .
i just need you to get on the phone
and help us get those supplies , okay ?
okay . okay .
here .
your turn not to freak out .
okay , forceps .
metz .
i have a status update on dr. webber .
okay .
dr. yang is attempting to place a balloon pump ,
but he keeps coding .
she &apos;s placing one bedside without fluoro ?
she could rupture his aorta .
do you want me to get dr. yang on the phone ?
you just said she &apos;s threading a balloon pump .
she is , but ...
then how is she gonna talk on the phone ?
i didn &apos;t ... mean ...
retract her .
oh , no .
no , no , no .
okay , let &apos;s run the bowel .
the abdomen &apos;s fully contaminated .
just run the bowel .
we &apos;re gonna resect this and get out of here .
let &apos;s get ready to pack him .
come on , lenny .
it &apos;s too quiet .
talk .
y @-@ you &apos;re doing good .
you ... are not going to rupture the aorta
because you ... are cristina yang .
attach this to the console .
you are the star of your class .
i always knew it . i said it to anyone who &apos;d ask--
&quot; look out for cristina yang . &quot; i @-@ i said it to webber .
&quot; cristina yang is good . &quot;
&quot; cristina yang would not rupture an aorta . &quot;
&quot; cristina ya-- &quot;
oh , god , you did it .
oh , dear lord . he has a steady heartbeat .
oh , praise jesus . you didn &apos;t rupture his aorta .
secure this device and get him up to the i.c.u.
we just bought him some time .
hug me back , cristina yang .
i know you are not a hugger ,
but right now i need you to hug me back .
hey , mrs. ashford .
did you find out ?
press against my hands with the bottoms of your feet .
find out what ?
about my house .
it has the most beautiful crown moldings .
now with your hands .
i &apos;m sorry . i haven &apos;t had time to ask about your house .
how &apos;s your vision ?
any blurriness ?
my vision ?
i don &apos;t care about my--
s @-@ stop .
stop this nonsense .
just call somebody , please . find out about my house .
ma &apos;am , this isn &apos;t nonsense .
i &apos;m trying to help you , and i have about 20 other patients ,
so checking on your house is the last thing
on my mind right now .
people got injured badly ,
so you need to stop worrying about your house ,
and you need to tell me if you are experiencing
any blurriness of vision .
his lactate is 6 .
6 ?
uh , he has an acute abdomen . get me an o.r. and a good staff .
i &apos;ll take , uh , linda , if she &apos;s available . norman .
are you out of your mind ?
norman &apos;s m.i.a.
okay , anna , then .
i &apos;ll make some phone calls .
you &apos;re not opening him up .
the electrical injury
may have caused intra @-@ abdominal tissue damage
and likely progressing because of his heart failing .
he barely tolerated the balloon pump .
i need to get in there and debride the dead tissue .
there &apos;s no way his heart can handle the anesthesia .
his lactate is 6 .
he needs sustained cardiac i.c.u.
he &apos;s gonna die if we don &apos;t do anything .
we &apos;re not doing nothing .
we &apos;re gonna let the balloon pump work ..
i am the attending ...
and keep his fluids tight .
you are a fellow . i make the decisions here .
well , i own this hospital . you work for me .
he &apos;s bleeding through the packing ,
and there &apos;s still stool coming out .
damn it . we need to take it out and resect more intestines .
how &apos;s his i.n.r. ?
the last one was 6 .
okay , give him factor vii , f.f.p.s and platelets .
faster , kepner .
he &apos;s having arrhythmias .
talk to me .
uh ... i can &apos;t get a pulse .
i think he &apos;s in p.e.a.
starting compressions .
i know this is difficult ,
but brooks is our patient .
i &apos;m telling you this to remind you to be her doctor ,
not her friend right now .
there are decisions to be made in there
that will affect not only her ability to be a surgeon ...
her speech , her ability to function , her life .
but those decisions are ultimately mine .
i will not make them lightly .
but i will make them quickly ,
and you need to do exactly as i say . no questions .
can you do that ?
i think so .
that &apos;s not good enough .
yes , sir . i @-@ i can do it , sir .
i &apos;ll take this to the labs ,
and dr. avery will let you know the results .
thank you .
hey . heard you were looking for this guy .
brian !
i was so worried . get over here and give me a kiss , you jerk .
baby , i &apos;m all muddy .
i don &apos;t care .
are you okay ?
mmm . i knew that was your handwriting .
what are you talking about ?
on oscar .
didn &apos;t you pull him out ?
no .
someone triaged a bunch of guys at the scene
and wrote vitals down with a sharpie .
yeah , i wish that was me .
i was just sitting in an air pocket ,
twiddling my thumbs .
uh , i actually think i &apos;m having some trouble moving .
i think i broke some ribs .
let &apos;s get those checked out .
yeah .
um , i heard lenny was in surgery . how &apos;s he doing ?
i don &apos;t know .
p.h. is down to 7.12 .
come on , lenny .
he &apos;s been down 20 minutes .
did you say &quot; yes &quot; ?
sir ?
to matthew .
i helped with his proposal .
oh , uh , yeah . yes . i said &quot; yes . &quot;
good .
i like him . he &apos;s a good guy .
i mean , these guys--
these first responders-- they &apos;re all good guys .
hate to give up .
damn it , lenny .
time of death--1556 .
it &apos;s dr. karev . the firefighters are asking for an update .
chaplain &apos;s on his way to tell marla and the girls .
she &apos;s gonna wanna come in
and see him .
absolutely .
let &apos;s bring her in . full lights and sirens .
on it .
lauenstein &apos;s still missing .
we gotta bring him back . we gotta do that for lenny .
if i could walk , i &apos;d be out on that pile .
excuse me .
kelly clamp .
suction .
guys , he &apos;s almost lost his entire blood volume .
if you don &apos;t get control up there--
it &apos;s already done .
i controlled the bleeding using a pringle maneuver .
wow . cool .
don &apos;t be so impressed . it &apos;s fairly standard .
yeah , i know , but you did it so well .
i was wrong before , murphy ,
when i implied that dr. robbins wasn &apos;t a real general surgeon .
she is . she &apos;s an excellent general surgeon .
it &apos;s okay . we &apos;ve all said things that we shouldn &apos;t have .
oh , owen .
owen , no . you &apos;re not gonna &quot; owen &quot; this .
no personal relationships . this is professional .
this is dr. hunt .
what is going on ?
dr. webber has an acute abdomen .
he needs surgery .
he barely survived the balloon pump .
his lactate is 6 ...
and holding .
so what if it &apos;s holding ? something is dead inside of him .
it &apos;s not gonna get undead .
it is way too risky , and you know it .
i would rather take the risk
than just wait for what we know is gonna kill him .
stop , stop . what does his healthcare directive say
about extraordinary measures ?
whoa . i smell dead people .
oh , and spiders . dead people killed by spiders .
okay , let &apos;s find his personnel file .
oh ! okay , i , uh , got it .
&quot; webber . &quot;
oh , no .
what , he doesn &apos;t have a healthcare directive ?
no . he has one .
i don &apos;t understand .
richard designated you as his medical power of attorney .
but he can &apos;t make me next of kin
without talking to me first .
he did .
after adele died , he revised his directive .
but--
meredith , i know this is a shock ,
but we don &apos;t have much time .
right now you need to make a decision .
his heart is too weak , meredith .
his heart can take it .
you trust me , right ? you named your baby after me .
hey , hey !
no personal relationships .
the amount of electricity he had in his body
should have killed him instantly ,
but it didn &apos;t , which tells me that the heart damage
isn &apos;t as bad as you think .
he coded four times .
and we got him back !
oh , and now you just sound idiotic .
ah @-@ ah ! dr. yang !
no , seriously . you sound like a family member
who googled &quot; electrocution &quot;
and is trying to remain optimistic .
well , i am optimistic .
well , richard should have made bailey his family member ,
because that is how she &apos;s acting right now .
i wish he would &apos;ve .
well , he didn &apos;t . he put meredith down .
why would he do that ?
and she knows as well as i do that
electric shock can cause death of tissues which could start a whole
inflammatory cascade unless i debride what &apos;s been damaged .
well , he &apos;ll have to handle it for a day to let his heart rest .
and then ...
he can &apos;t handle it ?
okay , now you sound like an idiot .
letting that tissue die is like taking a gun
and killing him .

because my mother would make a horrible grandmother ,
because she was a horrible mother .
so ... i &apos;m delusional and hormonal .
and i can &apos;t trust my delusional thoughts .
