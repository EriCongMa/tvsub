what is ms. porter saying happened ?
she &apos;s saying that sally initiated the kiss .
that &apos;s not true .
monte &apos;s career is at stake .
this lie could ruin her life .
privatization is incredibly effective .
we can get so much more done .
ms. keene must prove she can find gainful employment .
i got you a job .
what ?
where ?
with justina .
someone recently made an ugly accusation about you .
what &apos;d they say ?
that you had sex with your foster brother .
i still love you .
then why didn &apos;t you answer my letter ?
what letter ? what did it say ?
that i still love you too .
if you &apos;re ever not feeling this ,
then just be honest with me .
i think i did something stupid .
i kissed jude .
so we think the wife &apos;s still inside .
i know this guy , okay ? i arrested him last year
and he had a gun .
drop the gun !
&quot; for all of us waiting ,
our time will come . &quot;
&quot; the truth will then set us free . &quot;
&quot; day will rise , night will fall . &quot;
&quot; to you who are waiting ,
your kingdom will come
for one and for all . &quot;
those are the lyrics from one of jack &apos;s favorite metal bands .
jack never did find his kingdom here on earth .
he never did find a home or family to call his own .
but in the bible , jesus says ,
&quot; let the little children come to me
and do not hinder them ...
for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these . &quot;
may the kingdom of heaven belong to jack .
how was pearson even allowed to have another kid ?
it &apos;s the system , callie .
maybe we should cancel tomorrow .
i mean , it feels wrong to have a party .
well , it &apos;s not really a party .
i mean , it &apos;s a political event
and i mean , yes , we &apos;re launching
the fost and found phone app ,
but the main purpose is
to draw attention to the bill ,
and we &apos;ve got state senators coming , the mayor ...
okay . i just ...
look , i ... i understand .
everybody &apos;s grieving .
but the best way to honor jack is ...
is not on some beach or at home feeling sad .
it &apos;s doing something before another kid gets hurt
or killed in foster care .
what was he like ?
weird .
in a good way .
nobody knows this , but ...
i think he wanted to be more than friends .
he was gay ?
well ... he kissed me .
is that what you wanted ?
no .
i &apos;m not really sure i &apos;m into guys .
what about connor ?
i think it was just the person .
you know ?
so ...
are you , like , into girls ?
maybe .
i mean , i &apos;ve never even kissed a girl ,
so how would i know ?
hey , baby . come sit with us .
so sorry that your birthday is being
overshadowed by all this , love .
ah , it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s not until tomorrow anyway .
and are you sure all you want is
dinner at the house for your birthday ?
yeah . positive .
cortney &apos;s coming , yeah ?
yep .
is there anything we need to know about her ?
likes , dislikes , food allergies ?
uh , no . i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t think so .
except that there &apos;s ...
maybe something you should know .
just in case it comes up .
she has a kid .
mason . he &apos;s almost three ...
um ...
and it &apos;s ... it &apos;s not open for discussion .
i had sex with zoey because
i thought since you never said anything about my letter
that you were over me .
she &apos;s probably the one
who took it out of my purse , you know .
if she knew how i felt about you , why would ...
because she knows that you &apos;re a good guy
who wouldn &apos;t have sex with a girl and then dump her .
would you ?
i don &apos;t want to hurt her .
yeah , and i don &apos;t want to hurt nick either .
he &apos;s been really sweet to me , and ...
he saved the play .
your play .
but the play is over .
and isn &apos;t it worse to be with someone
when you love someone else ?
oh , i didn &apos;t know you guys were in here .
uh , yeah . we were ... we were just , uh ...
waiting for you ...
to go strike the sets .
well , what if we didn &apos;t ?
i ... i just talked to nick
and he &apos;s gonna talk to his dad about
letting us keep the show at the warehouse for , like , a real run .
i mean , we could ... we could like , charge admission .
you know , i mean , there &apos;s been all this buzz , you know ,
from people who ... who haven &apos;t seen it
or ... or want to see it again .
and i mean , there &apos;s a couple papers
that ... that want to review us .
i mean , why does this just have to be our senior project ?
right ?
what do you want me to do about it ?
well , i &apos;d like you to tell him that it &apos;s a bad idea
to date a girl who has a kid .
then why don &apos;t you tell him ?
lena thinks that , uh , he &apos;ll just get defensive
and dig in deeper if we say anything .
i think she &apos;s right .
well , i think that if you had a talk with him man @-@ to @-@ man
about the mistakes that you &apos;ve made with women ,
he might be a little more receptive .
should i start with his mother ?
okay , i am not here to start a fight , mike .
well , uh , maybe if you were a little less judgmental .
i &apos;m concerned about our son being taken advantage of again .
so , this is about dani .
no , this is about father and son
being vulnerable to needy women like dani and ana .
okay , okay . i &apos;ll speak to him .
okay , good . i &apos;ll impart my lack of wisdom
&apos;cause god forbid he should have any respect for his father .
you do remember that we had to take a restraining order out
to keep him away from callie ?
i don &apos;t want him to jeopardize his future
so he can take care of a girl and play daddy to her kid .
he may be 18 , but he &apos;s not an adult .
you get all that ?
pretty much .
we shouldn &apos;t be doing this , should we ?
they want us to come in this afternoon
so i &apos;m gonna have to meet you at callie &apos;s launch party .
okay .
you worried ?
it &apos;s never fun going in front of the department of education .
sally is gonna say that she kissed monte , right ?
i hope so .
but if she brings that mother , who knows .
well , i will get the lasagnas
for brandon &apos;s dinner tonight , all right ?
sounds good .
okay . good luck .
don &apos;t worry .
thank you .
hey , um , do you know what &apos;s going on with gabe ?
yes . he is out on bail pending his parole hearing .
is there anything we can do ?
i offered to talk to his parole officer , but he said no .
well , it wasn &apos;t his fault .
he didn &apos;t know mariana was gonna
show up at the warehouse .
i know , honey .
i &apos;m sure he will tell that to the judge .
yeah , but if he doesn &apos;t believe him ,
he could go back to jail , right ?
i guess he could . yeah .
well , that &apos;s not fair .
we have to do something .
and if it comes to that , we will , all right ?
don &apos;t worry , love .
go ahead .
you think your dad will say yes ?
oh , yeah . i mean , i got the ...
my old man in the palm of my hand .
yeah , no problem .
so are you excited ?
uh , i mean ... yeah .
yeah . brandon said that some reporters want to review you guys ?
i mean , what if you get discovered and blow up
and become a big star , huh ?
yeah , right .
why not ?
you &apos;re sexy , you &apos;re talented .
demi lovato &apos;s got nothing on you .
you &apos;re sweet .
hey , uh , do me a favor
and open up the glove compartment .
i need to get something .
what &apos;s this ?
open it .
oh , my god . are those diamonds ?
i never got you a proper birthday present .
you threw me a party with a dj .
yeah , yeah , but i wanted to get you something special .
here , let me put it on you .
it looks good on you .
it &apos;s a beautiful necklace .
thank you .
i realize i should have reported the incident immediately .
as lena pointed out to me ,
any impropriety ,
even if initiated by a student , um , that caused me no harm ,
must be disclosed .
i just didn &apos;t want to embarrass the girl
any more than she already was .
and sally is going to confirm that she initiated this kiss ?
yes .
okay . ms. porter , you can step out .
oh , and ...
please ask ms. benton to come in .
sally , thank you and your mother for being here .
now , i know this is not a ...
comfortable thing to talk about , but ...
maybe you can just tell us what happened .
um , ms. porter and i were working together
on our school &apos;s community outreach project , and ...
and , um , i kissed her .
or i tried to .
tell them why you kissed your principal .
she offered to write me a college recommendation
to brown , where she &apos;s an alumnus ...
if ...
if ... if i ...
if ... if you what ?
if i gave her what she wanted .
and did she say what she wanted ?
not in so many words ,
but she was always flirting with me and saying how pretty i was .
sally , that &apos;s not what you told me .
that &apos;s because you cornered her at your daughter &apos;s party
and tried to convince my daughter she &apos;s gay .
i did no such thing .
mrs. adams foster is an out lesbian
and she &apos;s covering for ms. porter
because they &apos;re lovers .
so how &apos;s your birthday so far ?
pretty great .
thanks for making an exception .
you know , to your no @-@ bringing @-@ guys @-@ home rule .
oh . yeah , well ,
i &apos;m just glad the toddler bed didn &apos;t turn you off .
right .
no , no , thomas the train &apos;s very inspiring actually .
you know , the whole , &quot; i think i can ,
i think i can , i think i can . &quot;
that &apos;s the little engine that could .
oh , right .
this little engine thinks he could again .
if you &apos;re interested .
hell no !
eddie , what are you doing here ?
get the hell out of my bed .
this isn &apos;t your bed !
pack your stuff and get out .
you can &apos;t just throw me out !
my name &apos;s on the lease !
but what about mason ?
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll tell him his mother &apos;s a whore .
you wanna mess with me ?
don &apos;t .
when i get back ,
you and all your crap better be out of here .
where are we supposed to live ?
why don &apos;t you move in with your boyfriend and his parents ?
so what happens now ?
they believe she kissed you .
and that we &apos;re not lovers .
i didn &apos;t flirt with her .
you were attentive and encouraging .
isn &apos;t that our job ? to encourage students ?
not off campus and not in our cars ...
and not without clear boundaries
because without them , people get the wrong ideas .
especially teenagers !
i have done everything i can to help you keep your job ,
but if it comes down to that , i can &apos;t defend you .
i didn &apos;t see you there .
sorry .
you look very nice .
thanks .
um , i have to get to the launch party early .
everything okay ?
i think i found out how pearson got jack .
how ?
through a non @-@ profit organization .
non @-@ profit ? like a charity ?
well , in this case , a private charity ,
who then gave his placement to a for @-@ profit
foster care company called arbiter .
how it works is most counties will only allow
for a certain limited number of foster care contracts
to go to for @-@ profit companies .
so how a company like arbiter gets around it
is that they create non @-@ profit companies who get the contracts
and then they turn around and hire arbiter
to place and care for the kid and get the money .
that sounds like a total scam .
yeah .
and apparently it &apos;s legal , but the worst part is that
arbiter &apos;s a multi @-@ million dollar company
that is traded on the new york stock exchange every day .
so , you can buy stock in foster care .
and with shareholders to answer to ,
there &apos;s a great deal of pressure to be profitable .
so , can we sue them ?
i suppose we could ,
but , um , you know , companies like that ,
they have insurance against liability .
what about the ceos ?
ceos are a protected class .
when the banks went under , not a single ceo
that was responsible for all of that fraud went to jail .
not a single one .
unfortunately , callie , aside from pearson ,
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re gonna be able to hold one person
responsible for what happened to jack .
it &apos;s gone .
he took all my money .
are you sure ?
i never took his name off the account .
oh , my god , how could he do this to me ?
this is all the money i was saving for the new apartment .
wait , no , hang on . my mom &apos;s a cop , okay ?
she &apos;s not gonna ...
we &apos;re still legally married , brandon .
he can say the money was his .
okay , well , do you have anywhere else to go ?
i mean , i have friends , but i can &apos;t stay with them forever .
okay , well ... well , what can i do ?
nothing , brandon . nothing .
this isn &apos;t your problem .
i don &apos;t want you to get dragged into this ,
and i &apos;m ruining your birthday .
hey , no .
hey , you &apos;re not ruining it .
okay ?
i have to go pick up mason from daycare .
i ... i would go with you , but i , uh ...
i have this thing to get to for ... callie .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll figure it out .
you don &apos;t have to worry about this .
look , i don &apos;t know about this arbiter company ,
but there are bad apples in privatization .
i mean , that &apos;s the point of the bill , is to weed them out
with ... with regulation and oversight .
okay , well what does it mean
if no one &apos;s really being held accountable ?
do you think government employees are held
accountable when they screw up ?
i mean , at least with the private sector ,
if you can &apos;t do your job , you lose it .
i mean , that &apos;s accountability .
look , look , i know it &apos;s confusing , callie ,
but we are so close to making meaningful reform .
you need to trust me .
okay .
okay . i made a few changes to your speech .
so daphne , can you show them to her ?
so , i set up this teleprompter app
so it highlights and scrolls as you speak .
that way , you don &apos;t lose your place .
i thought i was talking about jack .
i don &apos;t think we should .
why not ?
it &apos;s too sad .
i thought sad stories made people write checks .
they do , but today is also your day .
it &apos;s about fost and found
and telling success stories like yours .
come on , let me show you downstairs .
it looks fantastic .
come on .
巴尔波大道17421号 圣地亚哥 加州92117
callie , this is mr. kleiner .
he &apos;s governor brown &apos;s chief of advisor on child law .
nice to meet you .
hi . you too .
um , let &apos;s get a picture .
can you get a shot of us ?
hey , taylor . how are ya ?
you look very nice today .
thanks . uh , i wasn &apos;t sure if it was dressy .
thanks for coming .
thanks for inviting me .
hey , honey .
hi .
how &apos;d it go ?
uh ... not good .
you &apos;re getting back with mat ?
who told you that ?
he did .
i ...
maybe .
what about the play ?
you &apos;re just gonna blow it up ? what about nick ?
look , you know how much i love mat .
you think because you love someone
that ... that it &apos;s okay to hurt other people ?
that &apos;s easy for you to say .
no ! no , it &apos;s not easy for me to say .
when you hurt mat , you asked if you were a terrible person .
if you do this , then maybe you are .
i need to talk to you .
um , excuse me . sorry .
18 . hard to believe .
yep .
thanks .
so , what about this girl you &apos;re dating ?
what about her ?
well ... she &apos;s got a kid ? that &apos;s a lot of baggage .
well , yeah , but i mean , i ... i really like her .
you know , she &apos;s special ,
and i mean , who doesn &apos;t have baggage ?
true , true .
but your mom &apos;s worried that maybe you &apos;re ...
mom doesn &apos;t get to decide who i &apos;m dating .
okay ? i &apos;m ... i &apos;m 18 , i &apos;m an adult ,
and ... and i can stand up to her , so ...
what &apos;s that mean ?
nothing , nothing .
no , what ? you don &apos;t think i can stand up to her ?
i think she &apos;s really hard on you and you just take it .
okay , well , just keep your head on straight
and don &apos;t play dad to a kid .
don &apos;t worry .
and that &apos;s me talking .
it &apos;s gone . are you sure it was from arbiter ?
positive .
maybe it &apos;s in her office .
daphne !
she must have taken it out of the mail .
it has to be here somewhere .
yeah , i don &apos;t feel right about this .
here it is .
do you think it &apos;s the same company ?
it &apos;s their logo .
why did justina act like she &apos;d never heard of them ?
look inside and see .
but isn &apos;t it against the law to open someone &apos;s mail ?
not if it &apos;s already open .
they &apos;re paying her .
why ?
because she works for them .
here .
so what are you gonna do ?
well , if i ask her about it ,
then you &apos;ll lose your job and maybe ...
tasha .
i know .
i &apos;ll just figure out another way .
what are you doing ?
i left the pad on my desk
and callie just wanted to go over her speech .
so , what are you doing in here ?
we were just checking out the crowd .
i wanted to see how many people are down there .
okay .
well , it &apos;s time to begin .
could i have everybody &apos;s attention , please ?
so , i want to thank you all for being here .
we are here today to launch the fost and found phone app
and to applaud its creator ,
callie adams @-@ foster .
when i first heard callie tell her story
about being in foster care with her brother
and being placed in seven homes in seven years ,
many of them negligent and abusive ,
i knew immediately that she could advocate
for reform much better than i.
callie &apos;s fost and found web app has already helped
hundreds of kids find services that they desperately need .
but what they really need is
a system that protects and supports them .
we need reform , and the over 3,000 foster kids
in san diego county alone need it now .
so , it is my honor
to introduce a young woman that i greatly admire ,
my comrade in arms and my friend , callie adams @-@ foster .
the same day i met justina ,
i met a foster kid named jack downey .
he asked me to talk about
for @-@ profit privatized foster care .
he was in one of these homes
and he wasn &apos;t being treated well .
i had other friends in those homes
who were also being abused .
see , the more kids that these companies place
with foster families , the more money they make ,
so they &apos;re really ... they &apos;re not too picky
about who they place these kids with ,
and they don &apos;t have to because they operate outside
of the government system .
that &apos;s how jack was placed with a man named pearson ,
a man whose foster license had been taken away by the county
because he had abused his foster kids .
and those kids , believe it or not , were me and my brother .
he ... he abused us verbally and physically .
he also pulled a gun on us .
but we were lucky .
we were rescued by a wonderful foster family and adopted .
jack was not so lucky .
through a for @-@ profit company called the arbiter group ,
pearson got another kid .
he got jack .
and within a day of being placed with him ,
jack was dead . pearson beat him to death .
and i &apos;ve just learned that justina marks works for arbiter .
they &apos;re paying her to get a bill passed
because this bill will award more contracts
to for @-@ profit companies like them
who are not motivated by welfare , but by money .
arbiter is responsible for the death of jack ,
and if you pass this bill ,
more children will be hurt and killed .
how dare you .
how dare you .
you lied about everything .
do you realize what you &apos;ve just done ?
i don &apos;t care .
you will .
get away from my daughter .
excuse us .
you okay ?
you did the right thing .
not for jack . not in time .
sorry i ruined your birthday .
you didn &apos;t .
happy 18th .
i love it .
thank you .
hey , what &apos;s wrong ?
why are you crying ?
just so many lies .
it &apos;s okay .
everything all right ?
yeah .
she &apos;s , uh ...
it took a lot of courage to do what you did .
i &apos;m really proud of you .
party &apos;s still on ?
yeah , it is .
um , ana , aj .
oh . uh , this is for brandon .
oh , thanks . thank you very much .
i appreciate that .
so beverages and ... and food are in the kitchen ,
and outback , you know , we &apos;re doing kind of
a serve yourself buffet kind of thing , so ...
hey , uh , is callie okay ?
she will be .
yeah . um ...
you didn &apos;t tell me you were bringing ana .
oh , yeah . we &apos;re , uh , seeing each other .
you and ana are seeing each other .
uh , she just had a major slip , did she not ?
and she was sober for a year before that .
you know , one slip doesn &apos;t take you back to zero .
are you sure about that ?
i mean , she seemed to go back to zero when she saw gabe again .
stef , i know what i &apos;m doing .
besides , it &apos;s none of your business .
so i told brandon .
i know .
what are we gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
so what the hell is this ?
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s the sets from romeo and juliet .
i mean , it &apos;s cool , right ?
i thought you were gonna use the space to skateboard .
well , i ... i was , i was , but then , um , my friends ,
they ... they , uh , they lost the theater at school ,
so i figured , &quot; you know what ? &quot;
do you have any idea the liability you have exposed me to ?
what the hell is wrong with you ?
my girlfriend &apos;s in the play .
i don &apos;t know . i guess , i just , uh ...
thought i could impress her
by showing her how successful my dad is .
hasn &apos;t she seen your car ?
she &apos;s not into cars .
yeah , she &apos;s ... she &apos;s smart .
then what &apos;s she doing with you ?
you know , i really like her , dad .
and she likes me for me .
apparently not .
if you had to give her a warehouse ...
i just hope you &apos;re gettin &apos; laid .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s not like that .
it &apos;s always like that .
no , it &apos;s not .
you are not that special , okay ?
which is why you better make something out of yourself
&apos;cause this gravy train ends
when you graduate college .
if you get into college .
i &apos;m gonna make money .
okay ? i negotiated , half the door .
we &apos;ll get insurance or whatever .
you want me to make something of myself , well ...
well how about this , dad ?
how about this opportunity to be like ...
an entrepreneur ?
an entrepreneur ?
yeah .
okay .
what &apos;d you tell mason ?
uh , just that we &apos;re having a sleepover with aunt susan .
did you talk to eddie ?
brandon , it &apos;s your birthday .
let &apos;s have a good time .
thank you .
she seems lovely .
hello ?
who &apos;s this ?
uh , she &apos;s not here right now .
hey , hey , hey , hey , love , what &apos;s going on ?
a reporter just called to ask me about the allegations
i made against justina and arbiter .
what ?
am i in trouble ?
no , no , no .
they &apos;re in trouble , honey .
okay , listen , if they , uh , if they call again ,
you just ... you say , &quot; no comment , &quot; all right ?
yeah .
okay .
do you , uh ...
do you think there &apos;s something going on with jude and taylor ?
grr ! my man !
so my dad said yes .
he &apos;s gonna let us use the warehouse for the play .
that was easy .
you seen mariana ?
mm , yeah . she should be around here somewhere .
maybe out back .
okay .
a plane ticket to new york .
for your audition at julliard .
there &apos;s something else in there too .
it &apos;s the money from your hand settlement .
$ 7,500 .
in an account under your name .
okay ? to save for julliard when you get in .
uh , if i get in .
oh ... you will .
this is why we wanted you to have it , love .
okay ? we believe in you and your dreams .
if you stay focused , we know that you &apos;ll achieve them .
you hear me ?
thank you , moms .
you &apos;re welcome , honey .
mm , i love you .
i love you too .
i will , however , point out that it says &quot; economy . &quot;
hey .
is stef here ?
uh , yeah . come on in .
gabe .
i need to talk to you .
okay .
uh , sorry . i didn &apos;t know you had ...
no , no , no , it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s okay . what &apos;s going on ?
did you talk to my probation officer ?
no . absolutely not .
then how did he know that i was building sets for a school play ?
i told him .
yeah , i just wanted to explain
what happened with mariana was a mistake .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m not allowed to live within 500 feet of a school .
it wasn &apos;t at a school and my mom was supervising you ,
so i thought it was okay .
it wasn &apos;t !
i didn &apos;t tell my p.o. what i was doing ,
and that &apos;s a violation .
well , i was just trying to help .
i don &apos;t want your help . i thought i made that clear !
let me talk to your probation officer , please .
i will call him in ...
no . no . you &apos;ve done enough .
you know , at least i wasn &apos;t in prison .
and now i &apos;m probably going back , so ...
gabe !
ana !
hey .
where &apos;s taylor ?
she had to go home .
are you , like , interested in her ...
as more than friends ?
maybe .
why ?
you know , because you &apos;ve ...
been identifying as gay , so ...
i don &apos;t have to be .
well , yeah , of course you don &apos;t .
you can be whatever you are , but ...
i don &apos;t think you can choose .
god gave us free will .
to be who we are .
what if god doesn &apos;t want me to be gay ?
how would you know ?
because he took away
the only two guys i &apos;ve ever kissed in my life .
okay . jude , um ,
i don &apos;t think that god works that way ...
but ...
jack wasn &apos;t gay .
so , god didn &apos;t take him away
to punish you or something .
well ... well how do you know he wasn &apos;t gay ?
because he told me that he kissed you
because he wanted to make you feel better about connor ...
and then he realized it was a mistake .
i don &apos;t believe you .
jude , why would i lie ?
because you lie about a lot of things , callie .
callie , do you have any proof
justina marks is employed by arbiter ?
no comment .
is it true you made these false allegations
because she found out you were having sex
with your foster brother , brandon foster ?
what &apos;re we doing here ?
you &apos;ll see .
whose place is this ?
yours .
or it will be after you sign the lease .
i don &apos;t have any money .
i do .
no .
no way .
no . i &apos;m not letting you give me money !
look , i ... i would &apos;ve just rented it ,
but i ... i don &apos;t have any credit ,
so i gave the guy the first and last to hold it ,
and if you like it , you can move in today .
wait , you need that money for julliard .
i don &apos;t have enough money for julliard .
i ... i barely have enough money for a year &apos;s subway pass .
if i get in , the only way i go is if i get financial aid .
so , this money doesn &apos;t make a huge difference to me .
but it will for you and mason .
please .
let me do this .
after careful consideration , we are inclined to believe
ms. porter &apos;s version of events .
however , we have another problem .
it &apos;s come to our attention that ...
you allowed a registered sex offender
to build sets for a school play ?
so , uh , mariana told me that
you guys aren &apos;t getting back together .
thanks for not tanking the play .
it wasn &apos;t just about the play .
hey , brandon .
hey .
have you seen nick today ?
uh , no . not since he came over last night .
he came over last night ?
yeah , he was looking for you .
he wanted to tell you his dad &apos;s giving you guys the warehouse .
justina &apos;s not gonna get away
with dragging callie through the mud
because she ... she exposed the truth about her .
do we know that she &apos;s the one making these allegations ?
she posted the restraining order that we took out against brandon
on the fost and found website .
how did she get that ?
honey , it &apos;s public record .
this is libel . it &apos;s libel .
we &apos;re gonna ... we &apos;re gonna hire a lawyer
and we &apos;re gonna sue her ass !
let &apos;s not overreact .
we &apos;re not gonna allow this woman
to discredit our daughter and then destroy our family
with her lies , lena !
&apos;cause that &apos;s what they are !
stef , stef ...
callie , honey , listen to me .
listen , okay ?
we &apos;re gonna fight this .
you hear me ? we &apos;re gonna fight it .
we can &apos;t sue her .
oh , yes we can . we absolutely can .
no .
we can &apos;t because it &apos;s true .
