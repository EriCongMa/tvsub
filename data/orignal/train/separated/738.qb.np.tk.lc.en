they &apos;re still here .
i quite like having our names up there together .
frankie , stop ! it isn &apos;t me you want .
is there someone ? anyone ?
cat . it &apos;s always been cat .
you still have a mother , frankie .
you could see her .
she gave me up .
talk to her .
you &apos;re an actress ?
yeah .
i just got the lead in the play at the tron .
you &apos;re amazing , you know that ?
i love sam . she &apos;s moving in with me .
so stay away from frankie .
the last thing you need is her messing up your life again .
i love you , cat .
i always have .
hi , this is cat . leave me a message .
i told you we shouldn &apos;t take any toys .
he so fancied you . i think we made his day !
oh , jesus .
well , we &apos;re definitely not in rio any more .
nice necklace .
i wonder who gave me that ?
shouldn &apos;t we at least unpack ?
you seriously want to unpack ?
you &apos;re right . what am i saying ?
just here will do fine .
do you like that ?
send the ball back . send the ball back , tess .
come on , babe .
oh , no , i ...
kick it .
come on , we &apos;re waiting .
right here .
try again .
throw it !
give it some welly .
come on .
you are joking .
all right , focus .
when you said you were coming today ,
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;re actually gonna do it .
i was curious to see what 8 : 30 in the morning looks like .
it &apos;s amazing . there &apos;s all these people up and walking around .
you &apos;re not an early riser then , tess ?
course she isn &apos;t , she &apos;s an actress .
i always fancied acting .
judging by your performance this morning ,
don &apos;t get your hopes up .
you want to try beating me in arm @-@ wrestling ,
might improve your football skills .
sure you don &apos;t want some of this , babe ?
no , no , no . i &apos;ve got rehearsals tomorrow .
oh , yeah .
if you want to stay trim you should get active .
although maybe not football . not with that left foot .
oi ! leave her alone . she &apos;s got plenty of other skills .
all right .
ed &apos;s just texted me about that play on tuesday .
do you wanna go and see it ?
hmm , tuesday . i think i might be busy , you know .
if you give her 10 minutes , she might even think of a reason why .
&apos;the fertile bush of new south wales
&apos;teems with all manner of life ... &apos;
tess ?
yeah .
you had any more calls about the ad ?
uh , a bloke who sounded excited about living with lesbians
and a woman who sounded drunk .
nice . we &apos;ve gotta get a flatmate .
and if i don &apos;t get a job soon ,
i won &apos;t even be able to afford my own rent .
you could always offer the landlady sexual favours .
she wears a wig and smells of bleach .
beggars can &apos;t be choosers .
you heard from cat ?
uh , yeah , they &apos;re back . she left me a message earlier .
catch you later .
bye .
she &apos;s been weird for weeks .
she hasn &apos;t even slept with anyone since she broke up with sadie .
maybe that &apos;s it - she just needs a shag .
she &apos;s not the only one .
by the time i got my book deal ,
i was gonna have a really great girlfriend ,
or be living a don juan lifestyle .
instead , i &apos;m still buying tv dinners for one
and trying to cruise women in supermarkets .
you &apos;ll get groupies once it &apos;s published .
i can &apos;t wait that long .
i &apos;ve decided i &apos;m getting laid tonight .
ah . it &apos;s gay disco night at rubies .
i kind of told people we &apos;d go there .
what ?
i thought this was to finally celebrate my book deal .
oh , come on . you &apos;ll enjoy it once you get there .
what about this ?
do you think it says , i &apos;m a serious actress ?
yeah .
ed , you &apos;re supposed to be helping me .
it &apos;s ok for you . you &apos;ve been holed up in your love nest with fin .
anyway , why isn &apos;t she helping you ?
she &apos;s at work .
and anyway , shopping &apos;s not really her thing .
what ?
just you .
dating someone who &apos;s more into football than shopping .
it &apos;s funny .
well , at least she &apos;s nice to me ,
unlike every other woman i &apos;ve dated .
and ... the sex is great .
most of my other girlfriends have been really selfish in bed .
but she &apos;s like , really , really ...
well , she &apos;s just ... she &apos;s just really good .
i &apos;m only messing .
fin &apos;s great and i &apos;m sure
you &apos;ve got loads of other stuff in common .
yeah , of course .
and it &apos;s only been two months .
we &apos;re still getting to know each other .
anyway ... it &apos;s not like she expects me to sit around
watching sky sports with her mates .
no .
hello ?
oh , right , the room . yeah , yeah , it &apos;s still free .
uh , yep ! today &apos;s fine .
come in .
tess out ?
ah , yeah .
she &apos;s shopping for a rehearsal outfit with ed .
you could &apos;ve told me you were back .
i had to hear it from tess .
sorry .
how are you ?
been better .
it &apos;s not been fun sitting around waiting
to find out what you want .
well , now you know how it feels .
sorry , i shouldn &apos;t have said that .
i &apos;m making tea . do you want one ?
no , i can &apos;t stay .
i have to get to work .
tess seems to have gone all lesbian on me
and bought a billion different herbal varieties .
tess doesn &apos;t drink herbal tea .
i don &apos;t think anyone drinks hibiscus and goji berry , do they ?
except maybe madonna .
don &apos;t .
i can &apos;t sleep with you anymore , frankie - it was a mistake .
thanks .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve been going over it and over it while we were away .
i won &apos;t do this to sam , i love her .
i don &apos;t want to leave her .
and you don &apos;t love me ?
i can &apos;t do this !
cat .
fuck !
i wasn &apos;t expecting you back till tomorrow !
how was rio ?
hot . fun .
wish i was still there .
i don &apos;t .
it has been really bored when i &apos;m out here .
oh , thanks for those pitch documents .
sorry you had to do them on your own .
that &apos;s ok . just don &apos;t ever go away again .
so , here are the latest plans .
oh , you don &apos;t want to go over them now , do you ?
you don &apos;t have anything to smoke , do you ?
what ? don &apos;t tell me you took it up again on holiday .
i don &apos;t mean cigarettes .
you clearly spent way too long in south america .
come on .
i thought you &apos;d be chilled enough already .
i just went to see frankie .
can you keep your mouth shut ?
not usually , but , i &apos;ll make an exception on this occasion .
we were sleeping together before i went away .
jesus !
you &apos;re a dark horse , aren &apos;t you ?
does sam know ?
no , and she can &apos;t find out either .
all right .
i don &apos;t want to mess things up with her .
i told frankie it can &apos;t happen again .
i know you two are ...
well , i don &apos;t know actually . what the hell &apos;s going on ?
are you still in love with her or ...
i really don &apos;t want to talk about it now .
i just wanna get off my face .
well , that i could definitely help you with .
are you sure this is ok ?
i didn &apos;t know if it was all right ...
it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m glad you rang .
i was gonna call , just ... things have been a bit busy .
you &apos;re the second person to tell me that today .
there you go . i can &apos;t remember if you take sugar .
no .
look , is everything ok ?
it &apos;s just , well , you sounded upset on the phone .
cat , the woman i told you about ...
she got back from holiday .
and she doesn &apos;t want to be with you ?
no , i think she does .
but she won &apos;t leave her girlfriend .
well , if it &apos;s any consolation , it &apos;s probably hard for her too .
i was always having my heart broken
chasing after the wrong people when i was your age .
my so @-@ called uncle ?
yeah . he was definitely one of my mistakes .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean that you were ...
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s not like i thought i was planned .
no , you weren &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t plan to give you up either .
alma !
he must &apos;ve got an early flight .
you need to go .
what ? you just want me to leave ?
please . there &apos;s a side passage takes you out the front .
you &apos;re never gonna tell him about me , are you ?
where do i start , frankie ? the robbery ?
the daughter he doesn &apos;t even know i have ?
i can &apos;t do this right now . let &apos;s talk about it another time .
yeah .
do you think jemima in accounts will do a naked dance for me
if i asked her nicely ?
doubt it . she &apos;s got a husband and a volvo .
oh , well . i &apos;m sure her volvo won &apos;t mind .
shh ! we have to be normal .
alistair .
alistair .
there you both are . welcome back , cat .
i &apos;ve been looking for you .
i &apos;ve just spoken with the director at winrow and baines .
he &apos;s got to go off to new york tomorrow .
so i &apos;ve rescheduled your pitch to this afternoon ,
five o &apos;clock .
is that a problem ?
i presume you &apos;ve brought cat up to speed .
yeah , yeah !
great .
you &apos;ve got 45 minutes then .
frankie , are you back ?
sadie ?
why aren &apos;t you returning my calls ?
i haven &apos;t got my work phone anymore .
what do you want , frankie ?
to say thanks . i didn &apos;t realise
the cheap rent was dependent on me sleeping with you .
it wasn &apos;t .
yeah , right .
you could have had the decency to tell us .
we had two days to find somewhere new .
now we &apos;re having to look for a bloody flatmate .
i didn &apos;t tell you myself because i don &apos;t work there anymore .
they found out about the cheap rent and sacked me .
it &apos;s not my fault you &apos;re unhappy , frankie .
sort yourself out and stop acting like a fucking cock .
i &apos;m lexy . you must be tess ?
yeah .
sorry i &apos;m late .
oh , it &apos;s ok . my flatmate isn &apos;t here yet , so ...
do you want me to come back when she is -
in case i &apos;m a serial killer ?
no , no , no , no , it &apos;s fine . come in . she shouldn &apos;t be long .
um , unless you are .
oh , i used to dabble
but it was murder getting the bloodstains out of my clothes .
nice pad .
sorry , uh , i &apos;ve never interviewed a flatmate before .
do i show you the room first or ... ?
i &apos;m no expert , but i think you &apos;d probably show me the room
and then we &apos;d chat
and then you try and work out if i &apos;m weird or not .
ok . sounds like a good plan .
um , so , seeing as you mentioned it , are you weird ?
oh , not usually .
though i do live with my gran , so i guess that is a bit weird .
god , i could never live with my gran .
she &apos;s mad for pinching my cheeks .
oh , well , mine &apos;s from here so , you know , when i came over ...
and i wouldn &apos;t mind , it &apos;s just she &apos;s got a lot of pets
and i &apos;m trying to kick the whole bestiality thing .
oh ! sorry , i didn &apos;t get you .
um , do you want to ... ? it &apos;s just through there .
oh , cool !
if i move in
do i get to keep johnny cash at folsom prison ?
what , you like johnny cash ?
yeah , it &apos;s kind of a guilty secret
but i love country and western .
no way . me too .
really ?
well , it &apos;s not so secret .
i &apos;m kind of out about it to my friends .
ah , i love this play .
everyone &apos;s so bloody miserable in it .
they &apos;re doing it at the tron , aren &apos;t they ?
yeah , actually , uh , i &apos;m playing sonya .
really ?
that &apos;s so cool .
thanks .
so , what do you do ?
sorry . i sound like someone &apos;s dad .
i &apos;m gonna be asking if you &apos;ve got good prospects next .
i can ask for your daughter &apos;s hand in marriage if you like .
um , listen .
my flatmate &apos;s gonna be back soon
and i bought a selection of tea the other day
so that when we have guests i can say ,
&quot; do you want a cup of tea ? we have a selection . &quot;
um , do you want one ?
oh , only if you have a selection .
yes .
come on . this way .
fuck .
it &apos;s not funny , jay .
what are you doing ?
trying to sober up .
isn &apos;t there a tea you can drink ,
i heard that - to make you not stoned ?
that &apos;s to evade the urine test .
anyway we don &apos;t have any .
we want to create flowerbeds in the courtyard .
we imagine people having their lunch surrounded by roses and tulips and ...
what are they called ?
hmm ? tulips .
no , those lovely orange and pink flowers , you know ?
they &apos;re really ... pretty .
some of them have got a different colour
around the edges of the petals .
it almost makes me think someone &apos;s drawn it on with pen .
and they &apos;re really soft and smell lovely .
begonias !
begonias .
and now , my colleague , jay ,
will take you through the window designs .
jay .
the window designs .
sorry , sorry .
that &apos;s lunch . cutbacks .
hey , if you don &apos;t go for this pitch ,
we might starve to death .
i &apos;m sorry . he always cracks me up .
aw ! you &apos;ve got all my favourite stuff on here .
so , er , have you got any pets or kids
or wives we should know about ?
no , no , no . i &apos;m footloose and fancy @-@ free .
sorry i &apos;m late . i only just got your message .
so , you &apos;re the flatmate ?
do you two know each other ?
not exactly .
i almost didn &apos;t recognise you .
you &apos;ve done something with your hair , right ?
i &apos;m surprised you remember me at all .
didn &apos;t even get my name , did you ?
leona ?
lexy .
what did you do ?
we hooked up
and i was a bit of a cock and left without saying goodbye .
but if it &apos;s any consolation ,
i &apos;m often a cock , so it isn &apos;t personal .
yeah , i gotta go .
oh , no , no .
let &apos;s not leave things like this .
she &apos;s really nice .
i can &apos;t .
lexy , um ...
you &apos;re right . i was out of line .
it &apos;s no excuse , but i was pretty messed up at the time
and you just kind of got caught up with that .
i &apos;m sorry .
ah , fuck it . life &apos;s too short to bear a grudge .
why don &apos;t you come out for some beers with us later
and see if you can bear us ?
it &apos;s gay disco night at rubies .
do you think you can handle that ?
love a bit of disco .
awesome .
um ... beers , anyone ?
yeah .
you all right ? i &apos;m fin , tess &apos;s girlfriend .
hi , lexy .
what do you think ? will i do ?
um , i like you with a bit of eye make @-@ up , it suits you .
yeah ?
maybe i &apos;ll go the whole hog .
get a big , girly frock and some lipstick .
i don &apos;t know about that .
exactly . you &apos;d hate it .
you only went for me because
you bought into the big , butch copper thing .
like you didn &apos;t totally play up to it .
second date , you offered me a ride in your police car .
yeah .
well , it worked , didn &apos;t it ?
gets the ladies every time .
i &apos;m so knackered .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to go on your own ?
yes , i am .
everyone &apos;s really excited about seeing us .
the last thing you need is to sit around
brooding about that bloody pitch .
a couple of drinks will do you good .
ok .
ok .
ok .
ok .
but we &apos;re not staying long .
ok .
um , everyone .
uh , i would just like to propose a toast to ed .
um , it just goes to show
you can be a total nerd and still be successful .
speech !
i &apos;d just like to say ,
i hate you all , and thanks for bringing me to a gay bar
just to ensure i can &apos;t celebrate by getting laid .
no , you can get laid anywhere !
all you need to do is employ the three c &apos;s .
babes will be flocking in .
what ? i must be going wrong somewhere .
i never heard of no three c &apos;s .
oh , cocky , confident and charming .
no , seriously . women can sense if you &apos;re nervous .
you &apos;ve got to approach them
like you &apos;re the hot restaurant everyone wants to dine in .
come on , if ed was a restaurant ,
he &apos;d be giving away two @-@ for @-@ one lunch vouchers .
oi !
alternatively , ed , you could just try being friendly
and see if you have anything in common .
oh , yeah , if you want to send people to sleep .
yeah ? it worked for me .
so , lexy , what do you do ?
and how come we haven &apos;t seen you before ?
oh , i &apos;m a doctor in a &amp; e at queen &apos;s .
i work a lot .
i virtually lived there when i was training .
you got friday night , chundering piss @-@ artist brigade .
must &apos;ve been before my time , or i &apos;d remember you .
a doctor , hey ?
that &apos;s a bit grown @-@ up , isn &apos;t it ?
are you sure you want to live with these juvenile delinquents ?
oi .
no , no , no , i &apos;m not grown @-@ up .
i &apos;m only in it for the free drugs .
speaking of which ,
i &apos;ve brought friend charlie along to help us celebrate .
anyone care to join us at the bogs ?
oh , i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s my first day of rehearsals tomorrow .
all right , you can count me in .
yeah , and me .
right then , i guess it &apos;s just me ,
frankie , lexy and our soon @-@ to @-@ be @-@ famous author then .
let &apos;s go !
no , no way .
there &apos;s no way , jay .
ed , you lack confidence .
is it any wonder when you &apos;re a drug refuser ?
believe me ...
just once in your life , you wanna feel this good .
what if something goes wrong ?
and i &apos;m dead in the papers .
you don &apos;t usually drop dead unless you have a heart condition .
and it &apos;s a fairly quick end .
really ?
you can trust her . she &apos;s a doctor .
that was me .
you look like you needed that .
yeah , well , life seems that much better when you &apos;re off your tits .
if i die , tell my parents it was peer pressure .
you &apos;re losing your clip .
look what i got .
what are they ?
they &apos;re giving them out free at the bar .
just don &apos;t let me drink them tonight .
this is absolutely my last beer .
i refuse to be hung @-@ over tomorrow .
yeah , why don &apos;t i believe that ?
uh , pass me my coat .
so , what ? you &apos;re gonna put them in your coat ?
i &apos;m gonna put them in my pocket .
how long for ?
um , till saturday .
till saturday ?
yeah , yeah .
what ? you &apos;re the one who said a couple of drinks would do me good .
enjoy the honeymoon phase .
in a couple of months you could be griping just like this .
nice .
nah , me and tess are gonna be in a constant state of harmony .
she &apos;s way too gorgeous to argue with .
it &apos;s true . i am .
oi , there &apos;s some of my team @-@ mates .
tigger ! badger ! over here .
you play for a women &apos;s league ?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
give it a week i &apos;m gonna get tess in there .
hey , you right ?
we were just discussing the match tomorrow .
you guys are gonna get slaughtered .
you won &apos;t ever say that when we win .
piss off . you &apos;re just jealous cos you got relegated .
listen , give it a couple of weeks and we &apos;ll be back up there .
what are you laughing for ? it &apos;s not funny .
who do you support , sam ?
uh , bradford city .
i like your necklace .
sam got it for me on holiday .
what ?
they are a bit laddy locker room , aren &apos;t they ?
not fin , she &apos;s great .
yeah , i just ...
i wonder whether it matters that we &apos;re both so different .
do you think lexy &apos;s gonna move in ?
not if frankie &apos;s gonna sleep with her again .
again ?
yeah .
it turns out she was one of frankie &apos;s hit @-@ and @-@ runs .
she better not be bloody going home with her .
it &apos;d be just like frankie
to blow our chances of a decent flatmate for a quick shag .
all these blokes keep checking me out .
look !
that one over there .
and that one .
have drugs made you gay ?
you ok ?
yeah .
just the usual girl @-@ wants @-@ girl , can &apos;t @-@ have @-@ girl bollocks .
someone i know ?
nope .
christ , i hate coke .
it always makes me spill my guts .
i did not tell you that .
my lips are sealed .
you know what they say .
the best way to get over one girl is to get under another .
no , i wasn &apos;t referring to myself .
no offence but , uh , i don &apos;t make the same mistake twice .
none taken .
you &apos;re right . i generally am a mistake .
so , the cop , sam , does she go out with cat ?
do you fancy sam ?
oh , jesus , that was me trying to be subtle .
yeah , they &apos;re together .
although , i wouldn &apos;t let that put you off .
relationships are just things people do before they fuck someone else .
although , i wouldn &apos;t take my advice .
i &apos;m always pissing people off .
are you ok ?
yeah , no , i &apos;m just really tired . let &apos;s go .
ok .
oh , i &apos;m ready to hit the hay .
getting too old for partying on a school night .
hang your towel up in the bathroom on the way , will you ?
yeah , if you ask me nicely maybe .
i just wish you &apos;d tidy up after yourself .
bollocks ! that &apos;s not what this is about .
you &apos;ve been in a weird mood all night .
you &apos;re stressing about that bloody pitch
and taking it out on me .
well , you can argue with yourself , cos i &apos;m going to bed .
that &apos;s the thing . it was offside .
i cannot believe you &apos;re saying that goal should have been allowed .
it was offside .
i know !
then why are you arguing with me then ?
that match last week was terrible . i was sick .
i cannot believe the way that hearts are playing at the moment .
do you know what i &apos;m saying ?
sorry .
you &apos;re right . i was being a harpy .
you were a bit .
quite a lovable one , though .
you &apos;ll be ok , you know ?
as my dad always says , good things happen to good people .
i really fancy living in merchant city .
my parents rent me this place on the south sides .
i &apos;d move but my mum &apos;s all like , &quot; janice , why waste money ? &quot;
&quot; we give you a better deal . &quot;
she drives me nuts .
whoa , you like your herbal teas , don &apos;t you ?
hibiscus and goji berry .
who knew ?
beer ?
are we doing this or not ?
yeah , um , i think i &apos;ve changed my mind .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
sorry . it &apos;s not you .
i can call you a cab .
don &apos;t bother .
christ , one of these days i &apos;ll actually meet a lesbian
who isn &apos;t a total fuck @-@ up .
my god . i feel like shit .
why didn &apos;t you stop me from drinking so much ?
well , i was too busy getting wasted myself .
besides , you were numbing yourself to all their football talk .
i don &apos;t want to go to the scary rehearsal .
you &apos;ll be fine . you deserve this .
and you &apos;ll nail it .
anyway , be thankful you have a job .
if my life gets any worse ,
i &apos;ll be joining the hare krishnas .
what is up with you ?
nothing . everything . this bill .
that we should ... we should ask lexy to move in .
it &apos;s a no @-@ brainer .
what &apos;s the problem ? i thought you liked her .
yeah , it &apos;s a good idea .
just unless you were intending to sleep with her again .
tess , it was one fuck . i fuck a lot of people .
yeah , well , you seemed pretty pally last night
and , you know , she &apos;s really nice .
i could see why you might go there again .
seems like it &apos;s me that should be worried .
worried about what ?
nothing . all right , i need to get ready .
you &apos;re going to help me choose what to wear .
should i call her , then ?
yeah , good idea .
yeah .
i &apos;ll cook tonight .
you can play hostess with the mostest .
i asked ryder to come for
dinner with his new girlfriend , remember ?
this evening .
oh , cat . we blew him out before we went away .
i can &apos;t cancel again .
but don &apos;t worry . it &apos;ll be really low @-@ key .
ok .
ok . right , i &apos;m going . you coming ?
no , i &apos;ve a couple of things to do here before i go .
ok . see you later .
see you .
bye , gorgeous .
i look like one of the waltons .
nah , you look good , babe .
tina got so pissed last night she lost one of her shoes .
this looked good in the shop but it was a mistake , wasn &apos;t it ?
um , do you think you could stop texting your mates and help me ?
i &apos;ve been waiting for weeks for this to start .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m putting the phone down .
stop panicking .
why do we have to have a new director ?
what if he doesn &apos;t like me ? he might recast .
don &apos;t be silly .
look , how hard can it be ?
all you gotta do is go in there and say a few lines .
thanks . acting does take some skill , you know .
i &apos;m joking ! i &apos;m just trying to cheer you up .
sorry .
listen , whatever happens , i still think you &apos;re hot .
fin , fin !
look , for once in my life ,
i &apos;m gonna be 10 minutes early for rehearsal , ok ?
ok .
hi , i &apos;m tess roberts , playing sonya .
tess . i &apos;m tess . i &apos;m playing sonya .
tess roberts . tess roberts , playing sonya .
oh , fuck .
did alistair mention when winrow and baines would be in touch ?
i don &apos;t know .
are you all right ?
do you think frankie went home with lexy last night ?
i don &apos;t know .
is that what &apos;s bothering you ?
i thought you were happy with sam .
i am happy .
she &apos;s beautiful and kind and i don &apos;t want to lose her .
look ...
i feel bad saying this ,
right , frankie &apos;s my mate , but ...
she &apos;s not exactly the most reliable , is she ?
do you think i wouldn &apos;t have put her behind me if i could ?
what would you do ?
you &apos;re asking me ?
all right , well , i &apos;d ...
i &apos;d probably keep shagging them both
and make a great , big mess .
but then , i can always be relied upon to do the wrong thing .
who &apos;s that ?
someone pretty sozzled by the looks of things .
you don &apos;t think she &apos;s homeless , do you ?
she might have snuck in here .
actually , it &apos;s tess .
tess roberts . she &apos;s playing sonya .
tess .
tess !
what ?
oh , my god . oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry .
i got here earlier . i must have , um , drifted off .
are these yours ?
yes . yeah . i got them free at a club last night .
i tend to discourage alcohol in rehearsals .
no , no , no , i wasn &apos;t drinking them . honestly .
they were in my pocket .
i &apos;ll just ...
ok .
well , um , let &apos;s get some tea and let &apos;s get started .
ok . sorry .
these things are so nerve @-@ racking .
i always like a little tipple beforehand .
oh , no , no , no . i wasn &apos;t drinking them , honestly .
oh , i believe you . thousands wouldn &apos;t .
ok , i thought i &apos;d get the four of you in on your own ,
because you &apos;ll be working together a lot .
excuse me . i &apos;m sorry .
hi . i &apos;m in rehearsal .
just a minute .
um ... why don &apos;t you all introduce yourselves ?
you know what ? i don &apos;t think you left the gas on .
because you always think that but you never have ...
all right , i &apos;ll kick off , shall i ?
um , i &apos;m nora .
although you might have known me
as angela from cardiac care .
um , although i have escaped telly .
and i &apos;ve been giving my hedda at the national .
timothy here was my rather fantastic lovborg .
oh , please . you acted us all off the stage .
nora was wonderful .
stop it ! i did not !
i &apos;m not the one who &apos;s just been nominated
for a spanish bafta ,
you talented bastard .
didn &apos;t i see you in the seagull ?
probably .
for the last eight years ,
i &apos;ve played every weathered drunk going .
i &apos;m not complaining .
cuts down on the need for research .
what about you , tess ?
have you done much theatre ?
ah , no , not really .
mainly bits of telly , casualty , the bill ,
nothing very exciting .
i &apos;ve got a friend who was in the bill ,
maybe you know him , johnny stevens ?
i wasn &apos;t in it for very long . i only had a tiny part , so ...
go on , amuse us . what were your lines ?
oh , i can &apos;t really remember .
don &apos;t be a spoilsport , of course you can .
ah , well , it wasn &apos;t really ...
lines as such .
it was more like a noise .
well , like an exhalation of air .
i was a corpse that they found in the river .
and when they pulled me out ,
i made like a ... sound .
because corpses have air in them .
i &apos;ve played a few corpses in my time .
if i &apos;ve had a bit of a night beforehand ,
they don &apos;t even need to bother with make @-@ up .
well done , you .
from corpse to sonya in one fell swoop , that is ...
that is quite an achievement .
you must be thrilled .
right , sorry about that .
let &apos;s get going .
i thought we &apos;d start by looking at what the play means to us all .
this was at reception for you .
do you reckon he &apos;s talking to them now ?
i don &apos;t know . let &apos;s hope so .
希德
what is that ?
oh , it &apos;s nothing .
here he comes .
excellent news .
winrow and baines , they loved your pitch .
we &apos;re on board !
they thought you were , um , &quot; impressively eccentric . &quot;
what did they mean by that ?
oh , i threw in a few jokes .
you know what i &apos;m like , alistair .
made it a bit humorous .
yeah , well . whatever . we &apos;ve got the work .
that &apos;s the important thing .
congratulations .
thank you .
now , jay , i want you to liaise with them direct .
cat , you work up to jay .
and well done !
what ?
i can &apos;t help it if he recognises my superior talents .
it &apos;s not actually funny , jay , it &apos;s discrimination .
all right , well , don &apos;t take it out on me .
make a complaint . or talk to him .
actually , you know what ? it doesn &apos;t matter .
fuck it ! fuck him . i don &apos;t give a shit anymore .
i think we &apos;ve covered enough ground for today .
see you back here , ah , same time tomorrow .
um , what sort of sound ?
no , no , no , no , no . i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll be fine .
no . no @-@ one &apos;s ever died by using a microwave , no .
it is such a pain .
i still get all this fan mail from cardiac care .
i &apos;ve had it up to here with signing photos .
jesus , why didn &apos;t anyone tell me i look such a fright ?
don &apos;t be ridiculous . you look as gorgeous as ever .
don &apos;t worry , don &apos;t worry .
my hair always goes a bit
noel edmonds when i &apos;ve been in the rain .
i wasn &apos;t in the rain .
i &apos;m walking into town . are you coming ?
shit ! do you think i really offended her ?
oh , i wouldn &apos;t worry . she &apos;s just a typical wacktress .
what ?
wacky actress .
i &apos;d suggest we go for a drink
but seeing as my wife has decided to run off with a baby @-@ faced ham ,
i &apos;ve gotta go and buy a fucking duvet .
see you tomorrow .
bye .
jay .
mm @-@ hm ...
if alistair asks , i have a hospital appointment .
what are you up to ?
i thought i &apos;d try doing the wrong thing for a change .
i bet it wasn &apos;t as bad as you think it was .
how is my co @-@ workers thinking i &apos;m a loser ,
rude and drunk , not as bad as i think ?
well , loads of great actors are alcoholics .
that &apos;s not funny .
it made you smile though , didn &apos;t it ?
come here .
listen ...
i &apos;m so looking forward to chilling out .
that &apos;s gonna be the girls .
listen , you don &apos;t mind , do you ?
they really want to get to know you .
plus , they &apos;re a right laugh .
all right , girls ?
hi , tess , how &apos;s it going ?
hey , tess .
i didn &apos;t think you were a football fan .
oh , i &apos;m ...
sometimes i , uh ...
what you cooking , fin ?
how &apos;s rehearsals ?
good , yeah .
does anyone need a bottle @-@ opener ?
didn &apos;t expect to hear from you so soon .
did you go home with lexy last night ?
what do you care ?
you know i do .
if you must know , i went home with someone else .
but i couldn &apos;t go through with it .
i can &apos;t leave sam .
yeah , you told me that yesterday .
we could still see each other .
if you want me ,
this is the way you can have me until i &apos;ve worked out what to do .
so i &apos;m supposed to sit on the sidelines
while you continue to fuck your wife ?
forget it . it was a stupid idea .
wait .
someone might come down here .
it &apos;s half the buzz , isn &apos;t it ?
i seem to remember you always liked the idea of being caught .
oh , fuck that .
just fuck me .
we can eat now , if you don &apos;t want to wait .
no . you &apos;re all right ?
yeah .
they &apos;re doing ok .
they keep getting taken out by the defence .
come on .
see ! see what i mean ?
hi . sorry i &apos;m late .
i got held up on some work calls .
i have been phoning your mobile .
it &apos;s out of juice .
um , josie , cat .
cat , josie .
hi .
i &apos;m just gonna freshen up and i &apos;ll be out in one minute .
this is a great place . do you own it ?
no , it &apos;s rented .
so you two are thinking of buying together ?
yeah , maybe .
it &apos;s a bit soon for ...
maybe .
... for that .
sam said you &apos;ve been chasing some big contract at work .
yeah , we just found out today . we got it .
they &apos;re throwing a lot of money at a new development in partick .
that is fantastic . why didn &apos;t you say ?
because jay &apos;s been put in charge of it .
oh . shit , i &apos;m sorry , cat .
no , i &apos;ve decided to take a whole new approach .
doing the right thing gets me nowhere ,
so i &apos;ve decide not to give a shit anymore .
we &apos;re out of wine . anyone else want some more ?
i &apos;m ok , i &apos;ve got to work tomorrow .
me too .
all the more for me then .
she doesn &apos;t get on with the boss .
cat ?
cat , are you ok ?
might have drunk a bit too much .
oh , alistair is a prick .
you shouldn &apos;t let him make you so miserable .
sam ...
yeah .
i love you .
