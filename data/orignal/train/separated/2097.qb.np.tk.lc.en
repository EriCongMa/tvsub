back in the day , this used to be my beat .
district 5 .
every good cop knows his neighborhood .
i used to spend 60 @-@ plus hours a week here ,
and most of it was to get to know the people .
earn their trust , right ?
if people trust you ,
then they &apos;ll open up when the time comes .
makes a cop &apos;s job a lot easier .
you ever wish you &apos;d chosen another line of work ?
every day .
never .
all units , suspect pursuit
west on kamehameha highway , passing makalapa road .

well , you got the badge
and the wheel .

7 miles to exit 15 .

5 miles to exit 15 .
3.8 miles to exit 15 .
traffic ahead .
redirecting .

redirecting .
when possible , please make a u @-@ turn .
chin , i got blood .

oh , my god .
yo .
&quot; yo . &quot;
what happened to the courtesy knock ?
oh , uh , i think it got played out
with the high @-@ five and the bro @-@ hug .
i could ... you want me to do it now ?
happy ?
what &apos;s in the box ?
i got you a present .
you got me a present ?
yeah , i wanted to put a smile on your face .
really ?
no , ups left it for you .
you know anybody in bettendorf , iowa ?
yeah . finally .
so , uh , what is this ?
i , uh , i &apos;ve been looking
for a master cylinder for my dad &apos;s car .
that piece of junk in the garage ?
hey , all right , that piece of junk in the garage
was my dad &apos;s pride and joy ,
and he bought it for us to fix up together .
we just never got around to it .
okay .
so you thinking about getting it started again ?
yeah , i &apos;m doing okay , too .
i found this place in iowa
that do parts for mercury marquis ,
so , you know ...
man .
you know , i am not a gearhead ,
but that does not look like a master cylinder to me .
yeah , that &apos;s because it &apos;s a clutch plate .
do me a favor . am i crazy or does that say
&quot; 1974 master cylinder for a mercury marquis &quot; ?
you bought it online ?
yeah , i bought ... why ?
what , are you a schmuck ? what &apos;s the matter with you ?
you don &apos;t order anything off the internet .
danny , it &apos;s the 21st century .
says the guy with no master cylinder .
all right , you got a point .
mcgarrett .
yes , we &apos;re on our way .
looks like a bad wreck .
chips . reminds me of chips .
you remember chips ?
of course i remember chips .
you know i always thought that would be the sweetest gig .
you get to ride a motorcycle all day ,
solving crimes , you go on chases .
no , n @-@ no , you know , the mortality rate for motor cops
is five times higher than regular people .
danny , it &apos;s a tv cop fantasy .
why you got to ruin it with statistics ?
all right , fine , it &apos;s a tv cop fantasy .
in my tv cop fantasy ,
i am erik estrada , you &apos;re the other guy .
i don &apos;t think so , baby .
what do we got ?
hpd says it started as a routine traffic stop ,
then the kid gunned it and took off .
is he alive ?
barely .
ems took a while to stabilize him .
they &apos;re working on getting him out now .
got an i.d. ?
not yet , but , uh ,
we ran the plates and found out the car &apos;s a rental .
kono &apos;s reaching out right now to the car rental company
to get the driver &apos;s info .
wait a second .
call said this was a crime scene .
this looks like a traffic fatality .
well , we &apos;re here because it &apos;s about to get interesting .
we got a john doe .
actually , scratch that--
we got part of a john doe .
what it is , max ?
holy geez .
something you don &apos;t see every day .
white male , approximately 30 .
cloudiness of the cornea puts t.o.d.
at about six to eight hours ago .
there &apos;s not a lot of blood in the box .
minimal capillary hemorrhaging indicates
postmortem dismemberment .
you &apos;ll notice the irregular marks
alongside the posterior surface of the c3 vertebra .
really , steve ?
most likely caused by a saw .
you ever see anything like this before ?
murder and mutilation , uh , as an isolated incident , no .
it &apos;s a serial killer thing .
well , the head could be a trophy .
they just pulled the driver out ,
but ems doesn &apos;t think he &apos;s going to make it .
hey , guys .
what &apos;s your name ?
look , we found the head .
okay , why &apos;d you kill him ?
who is he ? just give me a name .
who is the guy ?
ming @-@ hua .
what did he say ?
ming @-@ hua-- it &apos;s a name in mandarin .
ming @-@ hua .
ming @-@ hua-- is that , is that your name ?
is that you ?
is it the dead guy ? who &apos;s ming @-@ hua ?
tell me , who &apos;s ming @-@ hua ?
is it you ?
great , now we got two john does .
and no answers .
spoke to the rental car company .
turns out the renter is a local .
his name &apos;s spenser owens .
okay , doesn &apos;t look like spenser &apos;s
our driver or our victim .
no , he &apos;s alive and well .
no priors , not even a speeding ticket in the system .
hpd said he reported the car stolen this morning ,
and i have officers bringing him over for a statement .
let &apos;s just assume the driver is the murderer , okay ?
he put a head in a box , he went for a cruise in a stolen car .
where was he going ?
gps was damaged during the accident .
maybe i can pull something off it , though .
get a point of origin , destination .
hey .
all right , so i ran prints on our driver
and the ones found on the box
through afis , tsa , and immigration ,
but i still came up with nothing .
driver spoke mandarin , right ?
maybe he was illegal .
that would explain why he &apos;s not in the system .
okay , what about our john doe no.2 ?
you mean jack ?
you got an i.d. ?
no , ja-- his head was in a box-- jack .
that just ain &apos;t right , bro .
too soon ?
little bit .
okay , what do you know about him ?
uh , besides the fact that his eyes were blue , nothing ,
but max said he &apos;s done posting the body and the head , so ...
we should head over .
okay .
we need to i.d. these guys , figure out what &apos;s going on .
chin , you take the car .
kono , talk to this spenser guy who rented the car .
we &apos;ll go talk to max .
&quot; jack &quot; ?
you have zero sense of humor . zero .
that &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s zero .
i ... it &apos;s bad , danny .
spenser , you &apos;re a local .
what are you doing renting a car ?
mine was in the shop .
i &apos;ve been working nights on a loft conversion off farrington ,
so i didn &apos;t even realize the car was gone
till i left work this morning .
i see you filed a police report .
yes , that &apos;s the first thing i did .
report says that you left the keys in the car .
i &apos;m an idiot .
i lose everything , so i left them under the visor .
did you also happen to leave a box in the car
before it was stolen ?
a box ?
no , i ... i didn &apos;t leave anything in the car .
did you use the gps ?
no , i did not use the gps .
look , can you please tell me what &apos;s going on ?
yeah .
we found your car .
great .
you get the guy who stole it ?
something like that .
do you recognize this man ?
no .
what about him ?
no , ma &apos;am .
what about the name ming @-@ hua ?
sorry .
i @-@ i wish i could be of more help .
okay .
thank you .
i ran your driver &apos;s dental records
cross @-@ referenced with the name ming @-@ hua .
nothing showed up in the system .
i also talked to my colleagues on the other islands ,
and they report nothing in terms of similar m.o.
maybe it was his first kill .
yeah , either that or he &apos;s done
a good job of covering his tracks so far .
doesn &apos;t the hpd have
a tattoo database they use to i.d. suspects ?
why , you don &apos;t think that says &quot; mom &quot; in chinese ?
not exactly .
it &apos;s triad .
this guy was in a gang .
max , what else you got ?
noticed traces of grease and motor oil under his fingernails .
there &apos;s a lot of wear and tear
on his hands for a guy his age .
yeah , signs of manual labor .
like hacking a guy &apos;s head off with a saw ?
obviously , for ...
smaller victim , uh ,
there were no fingerprints to be had or identified .
no hits the dental .
but i didn &apos;t run blood and tissue samples
tox , as well as reference samples to dna .
i will let you know when i have those results .
hey , i just got off the phone with mcgarrett .
still no i.d.s on our two john does .
and i ran faces through missing persons .
nothing there .
all right .
what about the guy who rented the car ?
just average victim of an auto theft .
didn &apos;t give us anything useful .
have faith , cuz .
the case is hardly cold .
what are you doing with the gps ?
just watch .
it &apos;s alive .
alright , let &apos;s see if we can get any data off .
all right , looks like there was one address inputted--
11878 keawe street .
it &apos;s an office building-- couple dozen businesses ,
multiple employees .
here &apos;s a list .
now based on the time the address was entered ,
i &apos;d say keawe street was our driver &apos;s final destination .
no pun intended .
max , go ahead . you &apos;re on speaker .
in analyzing the isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen
in the driver &apos;s hair ,
i &apos;ve linked him to the drinking water supply
in the waipahu area .
wait . spenser said his car was stolen off of farrington .
that &apos;s right . farrington goes straight through waipahu .
that makes sense . there &apos;s a pocket
of chinese immigrants that lives right there .
great work , max .
thank you .
how &apos;s your mandarin ?
he recognize our vic ?
yes . he says the kid comes in here all the time .
he works at a salvage yard couple of blocks down the street .
hey , you don &apos;t see many of those on the island .
what &apos;s this , a &apos; 57 ?
hey , you speak english ?
yes .
we need to ask you some questions .
my grandson , ming @-@ hua .
ming @-@ hua ...
hey , ming @-@ hua .
you like action figures ? huh ?
me , too .
me , too , buddy .
wait a minute .
i had one just like this .
my dad got me one just like this
when i was about your age .
let &apos;s see if we can fix him up here .
good as new .
here you go .
sir , do you know where the boy &apos;s father is ?
is this him ?
what &apos;s happened ?
where &apos;s my son ?
max .
mr. chi , when you &apos;re ready ,
we &apos;d like to ask you some questions .
mr. chi , we found your son in a stolen car ,
the victim &apos;s head in a ... in a box .
no .
it &apos;s not possible .
han could never do these things , no .
what did han do for work ?
he work for me ... on cars .
when was the last time you saw your son ?
yesterday morning .
he was ... he was very excited ...
he said , man gave him a $ 1,000 job .
what man ? did he give you a name ?
no .
he said
that man said , you make delivery . that &apos;s all .
he good man . he ...
he take good care for ming @-@ hua .
if he was was a good man ,
why was he running from the police ?
what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;re here illegally .
seven years ago , we come here
to find new home , to find new life .
han work very hard for his family .
he would never kill any person .
if that &apos;s true , we &apos;ll prove that .
so , i @-@ i want to know something .
tell me , what is it that makes you turn into a softie ?
what is that supposed to mean ?
what ? you just told this guy
that you &apos;re gonna make sure his son is proven innocent .
and i &apos;m just curious , what happens when you are wrong ?
the last words out of han chi &apos;s mouth
were his son &apos;s name , okay ? ming @-@ hua .
i mean , does that sound like a person
that goes around cutting people &apos;s heads off ?
son of sam liked dogs .
norman bates loved his mother .
that &apos;s a movie , danny .
i can give you more non @-@ cinematic references if you like .
i &apos;m just saying , i don &apos;t think han &apos;s our guy .
oh , well , good . then it &apos;s a wrap .
hey , you know what i mean ?
let &apos;s just go get a plate lunch and call it a day .
there &apos;s nothing in han chi &apos;s autopsy
that ties him to the murder .
okay ? which means there &apos;s no hard evidence ,
which you like to say , right ?
danny , as far as we know ,
han chi never even met the victim .
the guy &apos;s driving around with a head in his car , steven .
okay ? just a head . a grande cabeza .
the cops go to pull him over , and he runs .
yeah , the guy &apos;s in the country illegally , danny .
he &apos;s gonna get deported if he stops .
i mean , he &apos;s got a kid here .
what are you talking about ?
see ? stop .
you &apos;re done because now i see what &apos;s going on .
why is it that every time
somebody &apos;s father is involved ,
you get all goofy ?
i &apos;m not getting goofy . it &apos;s got nothing to do with my father .
i &apos;m telling you , every time we get
in a situation like this , you lose all objectivity .
it &apos;s got nothing to do ...
it &apos;s call transference , my friend .
oh , okay . now i didn &apos;t know
i was traveling in a car with dr. sigmund freud .
you don &apos;t have to save everybody . you don &apos;t .
that &apos;s all . okay . you done ?
if you &apos;ve learned something .
i &apos;ll take a &quot; yes &quot; there if it &apos;ll shut you up .
somebody offered han $ 1,000 to deliver a package .
he took the job and delivered the package
so he could put food on the table and feed his family .
but he was just the messenger , danny .
the guy who hired han to deliver the package--
that &apos;s the killer . that &apos;s the person we &apos;re looking for .
got tox results back on our severed head .
lab found elevated levels of lead in his blood .
which could mean our official c.o.d. is a gunshot wound .
exactly .
also found traces of iodine @-@ 131 .
iodine ?
yeah , it &apos;s radioactive .
our john doe was being treated for thyroid cancer .
based on these levels ,
most likely dosed within the week .
all right . so , what &apos;s our next move ?
i don &apos;t know .
what would you do , rook ?
uh , i &apos;d start canvassing our local hospitals
and oncology wards .
see if anyone recognizes our vic .
okay .
um ... oh , you know , hawaii medical center west
has the best oncology ward on the island .
yeah , they do , don &apos;t they ?
hey , look , i can , uh ...
i can handle it if you want .
i mean , if you &apos;re not comfortable .
no , no . i &apos;ll go with .
you sure ?
yeah . i &apos;ll be fine , kid .
any luck ?
oh , waiting for the hospital administrator .
the nurses won &apos;t release any information
without approval or a warrant .
patient confidentiality and all .
right .
did you touch base with mcgarrett ?
yeah . he thinks the driver was just the messenger ,
not the killer .
other than that , they got nothing .
you having second thoughts about coming ?
i told you i &apos;m fine .
really ? &apos; cause that &apos;s the third time you hit
the elevator button .
second .
how &apos;s this ?
i &apos;ll go wait at the nurses &apos; station .
i &apos;ll meet you at the lobby .
hey , i &apos;m a cop , remember ?
sometimes you got to go places and see people
you &apos;re not necessarily comfortable with .
it &apos;s just part of the job .
okay . whatever you say , cuz .
i &apos;ll go see what &apos;s taking so long .
be right back .
chin .
malia .
uh ... it &apos;s great to see you .
um , yeah .
great to see you , too .
uh , so , what @-@ what are you doing here ?
um , kono and i are working on a john doe case .
whoa . kono &apos;s here . i &apos;d @-@ i &apos;d love to see her .
oh , yeah , well , i &apos;m sure she &apos;d love to see you , too .
uh , look , i ...
look , i ...
ah , you @-@ you first .
well , i just ...
i think this is the first time we &apos;ve seen each other since ...
it is .
you look amazing .
thank you .
you &apos;re wearing it .
well , you told me to keep it , so ...
i did .
listen , i hope you know that everything i did
was to protect you .
i didn &apos;t want your protection , chin . i ...
when it ended between us ...
everyone thought i was the one that left you .
that really hurt .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , malia .
kono .
how are you ?
great .
so , uh , what are you doing here ?
well , actually , um , maybe you can help us .
we &apos;re trying to identify a homicide victim ,
might have been a cancer patient here .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s henry .
chin ?
his name was henry duncan .
35 years old . he was a high school physics teacher .
emergency contact listed n his file was his wife nicole .
kono put in a call to the house ,
but all she got was a busy signal .
nobody has a busy signal anymore .
it means something &apos;s wrong .
chin , get us the address . we &apos;re on the way .
i &apos;ll text it .
nicole ?
nicole duncan ?
clear in here .
nicole &apos;s gone , but come check this out .
we got , uh , blood splatter on the walls .
and a broken heel .
probably came off in a struggle .
blood &apos;s high velocity , consistent of a gunshot wound .
this could be where henry duncan was murdered .
or his wife .
yeah .
okay .
all right . thank you .
okay , uh , according to her boss ,
nicole duncan did not show up for work today .
i got alerts out .
all right , we got her credit cards , cash , cell phone .
all right , all signs are pointing to nicole
joining her husband in the victim category .
all right . if we can &apos;t find her ,
at least we can find out who they spoke to last .
you &apos;ve reached hawaiian airlines
flight information .
airline computer .
okay , hang on . uh , what is it ... star 69 .
dial star 69 and see about the last incoming call .
hello ?
hey , jimmy ?
i think you have the wrong number .
who &apos;s this ?
robert rovin . who &apos;s this ?
oh , wrong number . sorry .
hold on . hold on . hold on . hold on .
what you got ?
robert rovin .
i knew that name sounded familiar .
robert rovin .
he &apos;s one of the guys on chin &apos;s list .
gps destination .
okay , he &apos;s got an investment firm
on the tenth floor of that building on keawe street .
where han chi was going .
yeah , with duncan &apos;s head .
are you sure ?
okay , yeah . we &apos;re on our way now .
what is it ?
chin ran background on robert rovin .
okay , and it turns out
that he &apos;s related to our head in the box .
he &apos;s henry duncan &apos;s father @-@ in @-@ law .
nicole &apos;s father ?
yeah . since he never filed a missing persons report ,
that means one of two things--
either he knows what &apos;s going on ,
or we are on our way to make a death notification .
henry was murdered ? do you know who did it ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re working on right now .
my daughter ? what about , uh , nicole ?
i &apos;m afraid she &apos;s missing .
what ? missing ? what do you mean , she &apos;s missing ?
we haven &apos;t found her yet , but i have my task force
and every available police officer looking for her .
look , um , we know this is difficult for you .
please , if you can ,
you just tell us when &apos;s the last time you spoke to your daughter ?
i @-@ i , um ...
i called her a few days ago .
okay , um ,
by any chance , did she mention a trip that she was planning ?
no , no . that &apos;s impossible .
henry was sick . he ... he was fighting cancer .
he spent most of his time at the hospital .
could she have gone someplace by herself ?
no . she wouldn &apos;t have left him alone , uh , during chemo .
when was the last time you spoke to henry ?
monday . we @-@ we , uh ...
we met for dinner .
anything strange about that night ?
other than the fact that his disease
was sucking the life out of him , no .
i can &apos;t lose my little girl .
she &apos;s all i have left .
we &apos;re going to get to the bottom of this .
do either of you have any children ?
yeah , i do . i have a daughter .
then you &apos;ll understand the lengths you &apos;ll go to
as a parent to protect your children .
gentlemen , i &apos;ve been expecting this call ,
so please , if you &apos;ll excuse me ....
um , listen , we &apos;re going to let you know
as soon as we hear something .
thank you .
really quickly , i have one quick question for you .
you ever seen this man before ?
no , i haven &apos;t .
why ?
we have reason to believe that he was
on his way here last night .
well , if he was ,
i had no idea , so ...
please .
uh , excuse me .
yeah , of course .
that was interesting .
you see how panicked he got when he got that phone call ?
see how he was talking about his daughter ?
yeah . &quot; the lengths you would go to protect your children . &quot;
tell you what , that cat knows something .
he just did a bad job of hiding it .
i &apos;m going to call kono .
we &apos;ll sit on rovin , see what he &apos;s up to .
all right .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
how fast can she get here ?
whoa , whoa . not so close , wilcox .
you know what ? relax , okay ?
don &apos;t tell me how to tail a suspect .
by the way , if this was chips ,
i &apos;d be estrada . you &apos;d be wilcox .
i don &apos;t think so .
what &apos;s he up to ?
hey , check it out .
looks like he &apos;s got company .
it &apos;s a money drop .
gun ! gun ! come on ! come on ! come on !
hold on !
danny !
spenser owens .
he rented the mustang that chi was driving .
hey , hey . listen to me . hey .
where &apos;s nicole ?
you need to tell us where nicole is .
huh ? can you hear me ? listen to me !
where &apos;s nicole ?
he can &apos;t die .
if anything goes wrong , they &apos;ll kill my daughter . i ...
i just sent owens &apos; gun off to ballistics
in case we find duncan &apos;s body .
hopefully , we can match it up to a slug .
all right , i want deep background on owens--
all known associates , addresses , the whole bit .
so you &apos;ve never seen this guy before ?
no , i never saw him before .
the only contact i had with this guy
was over the phone .
he said he and his associates had nicole .
he said , uh , henry tried to escape ,
so they ... they killed him , but nicole is was still alive ,
and if i ever wanted to see her again ,
i had to give him $ 5 million .
okay . so you never thought to call the police ?
he told me he &apos;d kill her if i told anyone ,
so he told me to prove he was serious ,
he was going to send me a package .
but i never got anything .
i had him .
i had him and i let him go .
he wasn &apos;t even a suspect . you did your job .
don &apos;t .
you &apos;re not psychic . you can &apos;t read people &apos;s minds .
i should have known he was lying .
that comes with time and experience , kono .
look , we all make mistakes .
you got to learn to live with that ,
because that &apos;s part of the job .
she all right ?
she will be .
hey , guys , come here .
what do you got ? what is it ?
blowflies .
usually find them around dead bodies .
nicole ?
here we go .
looks like we found
the rest of henry duncan .
all right , uh , male . gunshot wound to the chest .
no , no , no . he doesn &apos;t need ...
no !
you got to find my daughter !
you &apos;ve got to find her !
get him out of here .
my daughter . god .
listen to me . listen to me now .
when spenser does not return with that money , all right ,
whoever he &apos;s working with is going to know that this went bad ...
and then nicole &apos;s dead .
hpd !
go , go , go , go !
living room is clear .
bedroom is clear .
nicole ?
kitchen &apos;s clear .
nicole duncan .
all clear .
she &apos;s not here .
he must have stashed her someplace else .
call hpd , tell them
nicole might be being held at a secondary location .
and get that saw over to the crime lab , okay ?
i want to make sure that blood doesn &apos;t belong to nicole .
looks like our boy was taking a trip .
pretty sure he was planning a vacation
once he got that ransom money .
hey , chin , listen , find out
if spenser owens purchased any overseas airline trips recently .
hey , tell him to call hawaiian airlines .
uh , cross @-@ reference any itineraries
of female passengers
or traveling companions .
you get that ?
i &apos;m on it .
what are you thinking ?
i am thinking that nicole is definitely involved , maybe .
but i don &apos;t think she &apos;s traveling under her own name .
i think she &apos;s a little too smart for that .
smart enough to stage her own kidnapping ?
yeah , i think so . a little help from spenser .
right ? i mean , let &apos;s think about it .
the guy has never committed a crime in his entire life .
and this-- this beautiful place--
is this where you &apos;d bring a hostage ?
that &apos;s pretty slim .
no .
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s not slim .
what &apos;s not slim is that he &apos;s got his bags packed .
she made a call from her house to hawaiian airlines , and
we have champagne .
champagne ?
yeah .
champagne with bubbles .
poured recently . look at you .
why was he drinking champagne
if he hasn &apos;t gotten the money yet ?
i wonder what shade nicole wears .
chin , go ahead .
yeah , you were right .
looks like spenser purchased two first class tickets to paris .
paris , france . france has no extradition treaty with the u.s.
yeah . he &apos;s traveling with a female companion
by the name of erin barrett ,
but i can &apos;t find any information on her .
oh , you won &apos;t . it &apos;s an alias .
how &apos;d you get to be so smart ?
this is the final boarding call
for flight 1182 bound for paris .
spenser , where are you ?
i &apos;ve been leaving messages .
baby , i &apos;m worried .
the plane &apos;s about to leave .
you know , if statistics are anything to go by ,
flying &apos;s actually the safest mode of transportation .
excuse me ?
well , you seem nervous , that &apos;s all .
i &apos;m waiting for somebody .
i don &apos;t want to miss my plane .
the thing is , uh ... nicole ,
that , uh , we @-@ we know everything .
or should i say erin ?
oh , um , i don &apos;t think spenser &apos;s going to make it .
actually , i &apos;m positive he &apos;s not gonna make it .
the slug we pulled out of your husband &apos;s body was a match
to the gun that spenser had on him , and the thing is ,
it wasn &apos;t just spenser &apos;s prints that we found on the gun .
yours were there , too , nicole .
i &apos;m just curious about one thing .
um , how long ...
uh , how long were you having an affair with spenser
before you decided to kill your husband ?
and why did you , uh ... why did you fake your own kidnapping ?
i mean , your husband was already dying of cancer .
i couldn &apos;t get five million
out of my father if he died that way .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s cold .
so what about han chi ? where does he fit
in all of this ?
who ?
who ? what , are you an owl ?
han chi . he &apos;s the guy that you paid
to bring the head of your ex @-@ husband to your father .
i don &apos;t know . just some day laborer
spenser hired who used to cut his lawn .
you just figured you &apos;d , uh ... you &apos;d use him again .
spenser wanted somebody who didn &apos;t ask any questions .
and this guy needed the work .
spenser rented him a car ,
plugged the address into the gps .
all he had to do was drop off the box .
right , when he didn &apos;t , spenser reported the car stolen ,
and then you figured that we &apos;d think that han was the killer .
if that guy hadn &apos;t messed up , we &apos;d be in paris right now ,
and he &apos;d have some money in his pocket .
he &apos;d also be an accomplice to a murder .
but han chi is dead now because of you .
and you know what else ?
a little boy lost a father today
because you wanted to take the easy way out .
i really , really hope
that you spend the rest of your life
rotting in a jail cell thinking about that .
are you done ?
am i done ?
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m done .
hey , danny ?
yeah .
you need to get this woman away from me .
you coming ?
no . you go .
i &apos;ll catch up .
okay .
please .
i &apos;m glad we could prove that han chi was innocent .
thank you .
for everything
you have done for my son .
there &apos;s one last thing .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a letter
signed by the governor of hawaii .
it states that she &apos;s personally expediting
your citizenship papers .
you &apos;re gonna be a u.s. citizen .
you and your family .
i ... i have something for you .
what is this ?
open .
master cylinder ,
&apos;74 mercury marquis .
you need help putting in , you call me .
please .
no .
thank you .
estrada was a bad bitch , man .
yup . that &apos;s why there &apos;s no way .
wait a minute .
why can &apos;t i be estrada ?
in a world where i didn &apos;t exist ,
you could be whatever you want .
that world sounds lovely .
it &apos;s logistics , anyway , danny .
you know , i mean , estrada &apos;s got dark hair .
wilcox is the blonde .
i know .
i know , but ladies loved estrada .
case in point , bub .
please . please stop .
you &apos;re making a fool of yourself .
okay ? just stop .
i &apos;m just saying .
no . just listen to what i &apos;m saying , man .
i have more in common with estrada . it &apos;s just ...
like what ? what do you have in common ?
like a nickname ?
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t know you had a nickname .
i have a nickname , and so did ponch .
that &apos;s ridiculous . just &apos; cause
i call you danno doesn &apos;t make you ponch .
can we just both be estrada ?
that &apos;s fine .
thank you .
