That's it, Fran. One more push.
As babies, we were easy.
One cry meant you were hungry...
It's a boy.
How is he? Is he okay?
Another, you were tired.
He's perfect.
It's only as adults that we become difficult.
Hey, wake up, pretty lady.
Morning.
It's gonna be a great morning.
We made you eggs benedict.
Where's Sofia?
Napping. Ooh. Try the eggs.
The--the bacon is jalapeno-infused.
Tomorrow we're making short ribs infused with Cabernet.
I just want coffee
infused with cream.
No, yeah, but just try the hollandaise.
I-I have to get ready. I have a big surgery--
Hold on.
So I--aah.
I'm so sorry.
We start to hide our feelings,
put up walls.
It gets to the point where we never really know
how anyone thinks or feels.
What?
My key's not working.
Yes, because I changed the locks.
Oh, come on!
Yes, this isn't my trial,
but that doesn't mean you can lock me out of
my own mouse lab.
My mouse lab.
Bailey, don't--
Without meaning to, we become masters of disguise.
Q's hyperglycemic, too.
Which means that about 20% of the mice with implants
have diabetes again.
Look, we--we should really tell Dr. Webber.
No, we are not telling him.
Well, okay, but--
Kepner, it is precisely because of challenges like this
that I handpicked you for this trial.
You handpicked me because
Cristina, Alex, and Jackson all said no.
And because you go above and beyond.
Look, you solve problems like no one else can.
Say it with me.
I solve problems...
...like no one else can.
Exactly. Now let's get to work.
Fifth year is the hardest year of your residency.
Every surgery you do will go on your record,
the wins and the losses.
In just a few months, you will...
What did I miss?
You're O.B. now?
Oh, how the mighty have fallen?
She misses Zola. Her uterus hurts.
Oh, leave her alone, dirtbag.
...of the more complicated surgeries you've scrubbed in.
You are embarrassing me.
I'm getting to deliver babies.
I'm making life, you know?
Yeah, you know what? You're making me gag.
Okay, slumming it in O.B. for a few weeks is okay.
Whatever. But...
Wearing the vagina squad scrubs in public?
It's--ugh.
We have standards, Meredith.
It is extremely important that you rack up
as many good outcomes as possible for your boards.
I am implementing a system.
I will receive an e-mail if any of you exceed
more than ten bad outcomes in your O.R.
Ten--any more is unacceptable.
Welcome, Dr. Kepner.
Sorry. I got stuck in the lab with Bailey.
I don't care where you were.
I care that you already have, let's see...
two bad outcomes in your O.R.
Loser.
Of course that's nothing
compared to Karev's impressive five bad outcomes.
I keep getting dud patients.
Tell it to your board examiners.
The point, people,
is to keep your bad outcomes to a minimum,
or you will be hard-pressed to find a fellowship next year.
Who are you texting?
Who do you think?
Uh, Dr. Yang,
are you sure that you're getting all this down?
Bad outcomes are bad,
which is why I have zero so far,
a perfect record I plan to continue
during my ortho rotation this week.
No one dies during a hip replacement.
Let's hope.
I'm sorry.
I will make sure that the scrub nurse
separates your macrodissectors from your micros.
I told her that yesterday, but she must have forgotten,
which I know sounds like an excuse,
and I am sorry for that too--
Lexie.
Yes.
Leave. Now.
Okay.
Can you go have sex with him and make him be nicer?
I told you, he's going to be hard on you
until you learn all of his quirks.
They're not quirks.
They're these scary, nitpicky rules...
just to drive me crazy.
Like what is the deal
with him needing 16 towels in the O.R.
at all times?
Well, if I give you all the answers,
you'll never learn on your own.
You're just as mean as he is.
Hi. How's your day going?
Bad. My O.R. is a mess,
my caseload is an exercise in boring.
Which you can't tell me
because we can't talk about neuro.
Right.
I know something else we can do instead.
No kissing in the hospital.
Why not?
We don't work together anymore.
You're just my wife.
9-1-1.
Okay. Now you can go.
I should be grateful that they're getting along, right?
But I'm not, though. I'm bitter.
All they do is cook together
and talk about food and watch shows
where other people talk about food and...
Uh, don't--don't read that.
"I'll bend you over the conference room table and"--oh!
Okay, why did you let me read that?
My husband can't get enough of me.
Jealous?
Yes, actually.
Arizona and I haven't had much "alone time" lately,
and so instead, we eat.
Oh, that's depressing.
Yeah, let's just talk about the case.
Okay. What is it?
Okay.
Hip replacement, shoulder dislocation?
This is your first time copiloting with me.
You think I'm gonna bore you with routine crap?
Get outta there.
My feet hurt!
Mr. And Mrs. Moser? Hi.
Hi. Sorry.
My, uh, lazy sack husband thinks that this is his bed.
Oh, it's--it's not?
No, this is our patient's parents.
Yeah.
This is Dr. Yang. She's my co-surgeon on the case.
Oh, so nice to meet you.
Get up!
Come on. Pretend you have manners for a second.
What, the kind of manners that allow you
to insult your husband in front of strangers?
Stop it.
Stop fighting.
You're scaring the doctors.
Hi. Tyler.
I'm, uh, I'm not staring at your boobs.
I mean, I-I am, but I-I can't help it.
Tyler suffers from
a degenerative bone disease called cervical spondylosis.
He was in a car accident two years ago,
which further injured his neck,
and so we are gonna build him a new one
in a 3-day, 3-part surgery.
Do not point that camera at me!
You look beautiful, sweetie.
Oh, are you the O.B.? Drugs, please.
Where's the attending?
She's stuck in an emergency C.
They were driving home to Olympia when her water broke.
She's two weeks early.
Hi, Mary. I'm Dr. Grey.
Oh, I don't care who you are, just give me drugs.
Okay, let's see if we have time for that.
Over here, honey.
Wow. You're crowning.
Did you just say "Wow"?
This--this is it. It's all happening.
Clay, I swear to God,
if you don't point that camera someplace else!
Oh, God!
Are--are you pushing? She shouldn't push, right?
Just give me a second.
Look over here. I'll distract you.
Brain tumor!
Brain tumor.
I call brain tumor on the video camera!
You can't call brain tumor right now.
It's my tumor. I make the rules.
Brain tumor?
Nobody said anything.
She has a grade IV astrocytoma.
You coulda led with that.
It's been a little hectic.
Head.
Hi, Emma.
Sweet little girl.
It's called a butterfly tumor
because it extends into both sides of the brain.
She has about six months.
She's dying, so they decided to have a baby?
Well, that's not the point.
So I had St. Catherine's send over all her scans,
and I want you to take them to Derek
and get him to do a consult.
Derek hates me.
You are better off taking them yourself.
The only thing holding our marriage together
is that we can't talk about neuro,
so he can't know that I had anything to do with this.
So you're using me? I'm your tumor mule?
Do you want him to stop yelling at you?
He needs to be inspired.
Hey, Karev, trade with me.
Ortho for Cardio.
I mean, you need a good outcome,
and I'm just doing a stupid neck surgery with Callie.
There's no such thing as a stupid neck surgery.
You're just afraid of tanking your winning streak,
so now you want back on the easy train.
Not happening.
What easy train?
Uh, that's what Dr. Karev calls your service.
'Cause your patients never die.
It's a compliment.
Oh, it has nothing to do with the fact
that you're piling up bad outcomes?
They were dud patients.
Oh, I'm sure. Shall we?
Who do I have to pay to get the tennis match on in here?
Uh, we'll have a nurse look into it.
Yeah, well, make sure she's cute.
Chuck Cain, 71.
Came into the E.R. last night
after a syncopal episode.
The scan showed a narrowed aortic valve
that we will replace during open-heart procedure.
Open heart?
It's a safe surgery. Don't worry.
I don't care about safe. I care about the scar.
How big?
10 inches at most.
10? Nope.
Not doing it.
Trust me
a-a scar is a small price to pay
for how much better you're going to feel.
How old do you think I am?
You're 71.
Because you read the chart.
But if you didn't, you'd say 60, right?
Look, I'm in incredible shape,
and the ladies agree.
But look, the minute you open up my chest,
I'm done.
There's no more meeting women at the pool
with a scar like that.
I mean, all they'll see
is a future of doctor's appointments,
hospital visits, and--and bad sex.
So, no. No open-heart surgery.
Look, Mr. Cain.
We'll investigate alternatives.
And get me a decent pillow while you're at it.
My ass has got more cushion than this thing.
Is it July yet?
'Cause I need a whole new crop of residents.
Huh. Little Grey still struggling?
Oh, she's drowning.
I didn't know how lucky I had it
until Meredith was off my service.
Do you know how to read these budget reports?
No. Why do you think I gave up that job?
You're a huge help.
Homemade maple-ginger scones.
Try.
Oh, no, no, no, really.
I just had a big lunch.
The scone's a very tough pastry to make.
You have to be exact with the ingredients,
the baking temperature--
Hey, how is the house coming?
Oh, we're working on the drywall now.
Really?
All right. I get it. I'm a bore.
But Avery's doing all my surgeries,
and I'm taking up cooking to keep my mind sharp
for when the next big case rolls in.
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.
Dr. Shepherd.
Yes.
Dr. Grey is looking for you. She says it's important.
My wife?
Nope.
Lexie.
Try a scone.
You know you want to.
Attaboy.
Today we're taking out the old hardware.
Tomorrow Sloan will remove the scar tissue.
And then we'll implant the cage.
Yeah! All right.
So... you're turn.
Just get in there and, uh,
you know, have fun with it.
Why wouldn't you just do a fusion in this case?
Isn't that standard procedure?
He's had four fusions already,
so we're really going for a long-term solution.
Really get in there with the drill.
Right, right, right.
Come on.
But the risk of paralysis is quite high with your approach.
Our approach, and only lame surgeons do fusions.
We're not lame.
We're fun... and badass.
Here, like this.
There you go.
Yeah. There you go. Felt good, right?
Yep.
Yeah.
Dr. Yang, that's your phone.
Really? During surgery?
Oh, it could be anyone.
Melanie, could you please read Dr. Yang's message aloud?
Melanie, don't do that.
Yes, Melanie, do. It could be Chief Hunt.
He might need Dr. Yang on an urgent matter.
Yep. Definitely sounds urgent.
Melanie, don't touch that phone!
Just, um...
turn it off.
No more texting me in the O.R.
Well, did anyone...
No.
Good.
'Cause the only thing getting me through these
budget reports is that,
and I get to do this.
I have to check on my patient.
I don't want Callie to give me a bad outcome.
I'll be quick. Come on.
Hunt, I found last year's budget.
I was just won--whoa. Oh, whoa.
Um, uh, uh, excuse me.
No, it's okay. I was just leaving.
Keep your phone on.
Okay.
In the conference room?
Richard--
Hunt, you're a chief now.
Act like it.
In the conference room?
So tell me you found the article
I asked you for two days ago.
No, but I'm really close.
This is the chart of a patient with a butterfly tumor.
Butterfly tumors are inoperable.
No, I-I know, but this patient,
she's a new mom, and it's a really sad story, actually,
but I was wondering if you could do a quick consult--
This is why you needed to find me so urgently...
to tell a woman her tumor's inoperable,
to remind her how sad her story is?
No, I-I-I just--
Just find the article.
Hey, um, April, I can't cover the E.R. tonight.
I have to do research for Shepherd.
No, what? I--
I--take it up with Shepherd.
I--come o--
Where are my mouse labs?
Oh, uh, s-sorry.
I was stuck in the O.R. all day,
trying not to fall behind in my surgeries.
Oh, so you'd rather just fall behind in my opinion of you?
I will take care of it right away.
It's hard to be a team when only one player cares, Kepner.
Now we removed all the old hardware,
and we're all set to implant the cage tomorrow.
So just try to get some rest, okay?
Oh, well, I'm gonna stay the night
and make sure, uh, he's got some company.
I'll stay. I-I-I don't need the rest.
A-and I do?
I don't know.
You're always talking about
how--how big the--the bags under your eyes are, so--
What?
Aren't visiting hours over?
Yes. They are.
Sorry.
Um, uh, all right. Well, call if you need anything.
All right?
Okay.
Okay.
Surgery brings out the worst in people.
Marriage brings out the worst in them.
I'm grateful they dropped everything
to help take care of me,
but seriously, the second I'm better,
I'm moving out.
I need some peace and quiet.
Well...
Let me help you get some now, okay?
Wh-what the hell?
I want to check your reflexes every half-hour
to make sure there's no nerve damage from the surgery.
You're home already?
Yeah, it's the advantage of a boring caseload.
Well, did your day get any better?
Yes, if you count the fried chicken sandwich
I got in the cafeteria.
Any interesting cases tomorrow?
Meredith.
No work talk.
I'll be right back.
Meredith.
Why didn't you tell Derek about Mary's tumor?
I-I-I did. He said it was inoperable.
Did you show him the scans?
Did you tell him it was in the frontal lobe?
Uh, I didn't get a chance.
Um, I am naked and wet in the shower, so--
Derek's a tumor junkie.
He needs to see the scans
and meet the patient to spark the case,
the same way he needs a 16th towel in the O.R.
to position his arm on the microscope.
Are you gonna remember all this or do I need to write it down?
Naked and wet in the shower.
I need to write it down.
Chuck Cain.
I gave you his blood work five hours ago.
Alex, I need you to cover the E.R. tonight.
No.
Look, before midnight would be nice.
I'm still looking.
It's the E.R.
People will die if we're not there.
Which will be your fault, not mine.
Got it. Here you go.
Finally.
Alex, please, can't you just be a person for a second?
See?
This is why you don't deserve this job.
You're bad at it.
You get all stressed out and frantic
and nobody wants to listen to you.
You have no authority, and your voice...
It gets all high and nasally like this when you're nervous.
It's annoying.
You're annoying, so, no,
I can't be a person for a second.
Deal with your own crap!
Still not paralyzed.
Good.
Do you know you snore?
Yes, and I've been told it's adorable.
It's not.
Morning.
Oh, sorry we're late, baby.
Oh, of course, your, uh, smarty-pants father
refused to check the traffic report.
Are you hungry?
Uh, he can't eat before surgery.
See? I told you, no food allowed.
Oh, please.
One little doughnut won't hurt.
Actually, it will,
just like it will it hurt all of you
by promoting, uh, high cholesterol and plaque buildup.
I confirmed your consults tonight,
and I know you're gonna ask me about that--that article, but--
Oh, you--you haven't found it yet?
Look!
Butterfly tumor.
Wait. I mean, all the doctors we've seen
said the tumor's inoperable.
Surgery could put her in a coma or kill her.
It's just another set of scans.
Exactly, and it'll be good for you
to have some alone time with Emma.
You know, that way I can die knowing that
you're not gonna drop her on her head.
Fine.
Run the scans.
Okay.
I really don't have time for this.
Two more moms just came in.
Well, yeah, but as long as no one's crowning,
they'll be fine.
What are you doing?!
Uh, researching a new surgery for my neck guy.
What are you feeding my mouse?
Q. is diabetic. A doughnut could kill him.
Then why is he in your office?
So Meredith can run tests on him.
Are you really gonna do her grunt work?
Oh, Bailey blames me for Richard losing his trial.
The last thing she wants is for me to work on it.
Which is why you're doing it in secret.
Okay, that is the worst idea I've ever heard.
Seriously.
I am your chief resident, Dr. Grey.
Which means if you cross me,
I will make your life a living hell.
I will put you on call every night,
I will assign you dumb interns,
and I will make sure
that you get every exploding bowel and rotting limb
that comes into this hospital.
Okay.
Relax. I'll do it.
O-okay.
It's 'cause I made my voice different, right?
That's-- that's why you lis--
Go away before you embarrass yourself more.
Oh, that's Owen. Duty calls.
Are you two talking yet, or is it just sex?
Not just sex.
Hot, dirty, stand-on-my-head sex.
I'll take that as a no.
You know what? Who cares if we talk?
Besides, if you want to talk about something,
how about the fact that you're wasting your fifth year
playing around with vaginas and mice?
Want to talk about that?
Do you really stand on your head?
I'm very talented.
This procedure is minimally invasive.
And the great news is,
the scar will look like this.
It's much smaller.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but I want this instead.
What the hell is that?
That's my friend Tony's groin.
I had him e-mail me a picture last night.
He had the same problem with his valve last year,
and his doctor replaced it with a catheter through the groin.
See? Barely any scar.
It's called a TAVI.
Yeah, a TAVI is an experimental procedure.
There are-- there are tons of risks--
Uh, bleeding, stroke--
Look, I'm the one having this and paying for it, right?
So if I say I want a TAVI, give me a TAVI.
Look, there is a much safer solution to your problem.
It's called a-a rash guard. You wear it at the pool.
No one will see your scar.
Clearly you've never been to Palm Beach.
Only fatties wear rash guards.
I can't get through to this guy.
He wants a TAVI.
Look into it and decide if he's a good candidate.
I'll look into a TAVI.
See? Now that's the answer I was looking for.
I knew you had it in you, kid.
Hey, Grey.
Uh, no, keep walking.
Eyes ahead. Act normal.
I saw Kepner take a mouse into that room.
What's going on?
I don't know anything.
You're blinking.
Okey. Now you know something.
Is something wrong with the device?
I really shouldn't talk about it.
Grey.
Bailey's not gonna find out about it?
Bailey locked me out of my own mouse lab.
I'm not telling her crap.
Some of the mice are hyperglycemic.
We're running some tests to find out why.
All right, this is what you do--
get a healthy mouse, run some labs
And compare the stats. Can you do that?
Well, April's being a little bit--
Oh, you can handle Kepner, Grey.
Now I'm on call, so page me when you get the results.
Okay.
All right.
Hi there. Uh, um, beautiful day, isn't it?
Oh, damn it.
You need a hand?
Uh, no, ju-just, the cage won't fit.
His bone's so destroyed, the screws won't hold.
We should do the fusion instead.
No.
Well, I researched it.
We can refuse him if we take down enough of his scar tissue--
I said no.
My surgery got pushed.
And I can't pick up the short ribs.
The butcher closes at 6:00, right?
Why are you so gung-ho to do this?
Why are you so not?
We could roast a chicken.
Yes.
Could we please shut up about dinner?
Please.
Oh, sorry.
Forget it. We're closing him up.
What? No.
Yes. We need more time
to figure out a new game plan that's not a fusion.
So I'm gonna secure the cage temporarily and close.
Which means I'm free to go to the butcher.
Problem solved.
Most astrocytomas spread out through the corpus callosum.
It fans out like smoke.
But if you look at your tumor, Mary,
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at the edges-- they're smooth, defined.
They're easier to cut around.
Yes, if I can keep my entire dissection inside
and never let it drift outside--
I'm sorry.
Are you, um,
saying what I think you're saying?
Mary, I think I can remove your tumor.
I love this guy.
We don't know this guy.
He's amazing, right? Tell my husband.
He's pretty amazing.
This isn't a decision you make on a whim.
You're right. You need time to
make this decision.
We don't need time.
We've decided. Sign me up.
Emma.
Yeah.
If you get to call brain tumor,
I get to call Emma.
It's not just the two of us anymore.
We have a daughter.
She needs these six months with you.
I mean, you're her mom.
Please, Mary.
Don't do this.
You're ditching O.B. to be a vet now?
Oh, April dumped Bailey's trial on me.
I would be annoyed, but it turns out I'm good with mice.
And I found her secret snack drawer.
Sweet.
Hey. Hey, that is not your food. Not your food.
What--what have you done to my office?
Get over it. I'm helping you.
And go get me a healthy mouse.
Bailey hasn't left the lab in 48 hours.
I-I can't steal another mouse.
I can't steal another mouse.
Fine.
Fine. Just keep going,
And--and good job.
Tell me what it feels like to get a bad outcome.
Neck guy's paralyzed?
Not yet.
What would happen if I took my name off the case?
Do it. You can take my old guy.
Altman's trying to make me do a TAVI on him.
Oh, no way. You're just asking for a bad outcome.
Peanut?
No.
Derek ran an M.R.A. and
found out he can reach under the pericallosal vessels
And reach the tumor on both sides.
So he's operating?
No.
Mary's afraid of the risks.
Well, Clay really, but she listened to him.
Okay, but did you tell them how good he is?
Yeah.
Kind of.
Do I have to do everything myself?
Hot.
Right?
Come on. Come on, G.
Come on, little guy. Come on.
Your voice doesn't whisper, Kepner.
Sorry. Sorry.
I-I- didn't want to distract you.
I need to run an A1C on G.
G. is healthy.
We don't need to run an AlC on him.
Yes, but I think I'm on to something, though.
On to what?
I'll tell you when I figure it out.
I read the research,
I talked to some other surgeons.
But I'm not doing a TAVI on you.
And that's your final answer?
That's my final answer.
I'll give you some time to make a decision.
And here I took you for a guy
who had a pair on him.
It's a stupid scar, Chuck.
You really want to die because of it?
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I got stuck planning tomorrow's surgery.
Oh, well, did you figure it out?
You know it. Sofia?
Mm. She is asleep.
Mm. She was so talkative--whoa.
Aw. I miss that.
Mm. I bet I know what else you miss.
Who's hungry?
I got braised short ribs,
roasted potatoes, and a nice pinot from Napa.
It looks amazing.
It's not me.
Oh, me neither.
It's me.
Ohh. Oh!
The car seat's not clicking in
and it's supposed to be clicking.
Let me try.
You just have to line up the arrows.
I heard Dr. Shepherd came by.
Look, uh...
I'm sure he's a great surgeon,
but we've seen a lot of great surgeons.
And I-I know I'm the bad guy here, but...
I just had a baby.
I want to be happy, you know?
At least today.
Maybe a couple more months.
But I-- A couple more months isn't enough.
She wants more.
We made this decision a long time ago
because we knew that once Emma was born,
we'd be too emotional.
She's not thinking--
But now she's seen and held her baby.
And she can't imagine not being here.
And she wants more time.
I want more time.
I'm not ready for her to die.
And she's not, either.
And that's why she wants to fight.
Diane Schiffman would make a great wife, you know?
And she's great with the kids at the block party.
Yeah, 'cause she's always drunk.
What about Wendy McDowell?
Ah, too uptight.
She's turn Emma into a nervous wreck.
Erin Miller?
She's way too hot for you.
Mary.
I know.
It's time.
Come here.
Thank you, honey,
for giving me this.
And I'm gonna see you soon.
You, too, my precious, little perfect girl.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, let's go.
Here we go.
Are you kidding me?
How the hell is this not working?
Dr. Torres--
Just give me a second, okay?
As co-surgeon on this case,
I say we abandon the reconstruction,
and do a standard fusion.
We're not quitting. How many times do I have to say that?
I'm simply recommending an alternative solution.
Yeah?
Well, your solution sucks.
He's lost motor evoked responses.
Okay, that's it. You know, I'm--I'm out.
I'm taking my name off the case.
Wait.
There's an electrode out.
Unbelievable.
All right. How's that?
Great. He's fine.
Done. Your name's off the case.
5.5-millimeter cobalt chrome rod
and alternating cross connectors.
I'm gonna link the three rods together.
What? You can use the cobalt rods for this?
What do you care? You're off the case.
Go!
All right. Let's get the next one.
I compared healthy and hyperglycemic mice.
It looks like the islet cells are being rejected.
So it's not the device. Well, that's good.
Uh, it could be
a recurrence of autoimmunity...
Or a problem with the engraftment.
Maybe it's not the cells being rejected.
Maybe they're just not surviving because of other causes.
So we should check for signs of rejection?
Exactly. Okay. Bump me.
We're looking in the wrong place.
The device is working,
but something is harming the islet cells.
How did you figure that out?
It doesn't matter.
So tell Bailey to look for signs of rejection.
And who do you think you are?
What, god, is that who you are?
Dr. Bailey, she was just doing
what I asked her to do.
Because either you're god,
or you are the most reckless, arrogant resident
I have come across in my entire career.
I mean, to put your hands on another clinical trial
after you already ruined one is a level of stupidity
so staggering--
I delegated.
This has nothing to do--
You are fired from my trial, Kepner.
And you...
Just give me back my mouse.
I--
Not until you read my research.
Dr. Bailey!
Read my research.
Hey, that kinda works.
Okay, I've cleared out the tumor
on the right side of the brain, but look.
See all those vessels blocking the way now?
It's like a line of defense.
That's why the tumor's so smart.
It grows on both sides of the brain
so we'll be too scared to cross over.
But she has six months. That's--that's something.
You know, a-and you tried.
There's no shame in stopping now--
Lexie.
Yeah.
We're not stopping.
But you just said the tumor is smart.
We're smarter.
Bipolars.
Hey, it's my fifth year.
I have to defend every decision
made in my O.R. at the boards.
Do you know why I picked you to be my co-surgeon?
I-I...
Because you...
you take crazy risks in the O.R.
But the surgeon I've worked with the past three days?
Safe,
boring, a...
B-minus version of herself.
I get it. Fifth year is competitive.
Your whole career depends on it,
but if you're not careful,
you're gonna wake up one day and realize
that you're no longer the badass,
hard-core,
spontaneous, take-charge,
crazy, fun person you thought you were,
but instead, some sad, sorry wife
who stays in every night and talks about food
like it's an orgasm when it's clearly not.
An orgasm is an orgasm.
I'm sorry. What?
Don't let fifth year get to you.
You mind if I sit?
Please.
She's herniating.
What the hell happened?
A vessel leaked. The tumor's starting to swell.
Okay, we're gonna have to drain the ventricle.
Get me a blunt-tip needle. Now.
You're going in blind?
We have no choice.
Just tell me.
We got it.
We got the whole tumor.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You have a mommy, Emma.
You have a mom.
Once they have prepped you,
I will meet you in the cath lab and do the TAVI.
Hey, Chuck, what the hell?
Crap.
Look, the lady had a bigger pair than you.
No hard feelings, okay?
Let's go.
Hey, doll, how old do you think I am?
I-I want my patient back.
I was being cautious. You-- you can't punish me for that.
Actually, I can.
You've had some bad outcomes. We all get bad outcomes.
Your problem is
that you let it get to you, and now you're scared.
The only thing worse than
a bad surgeon is a scared one.
Pretty soon, you'll be able to do everything
you couldn't do before--
feed yourself, look girls in the eye.
How about sports?
Don't be an idiot, idiot.
You know that he cannot do sports.
Will you just get a divorce?
She said everything.
And what did I tell you about this name calling?
Get a divorce.
Well, okay, then I got a new one for you.
Bitch face.
Oh, how original.
I said get a divorce!
I get it.
You had to stay together until I was outta high school.
Then it was college,
and then this neck thing happened,
but that's over now.
My neck's fine,
so you two are free to leave each other.
Listen, kiddo.
No, baby, it has nothing to do with you.
We just think at the top of our
He's just this way all the
You hate each other!
You hate each other.
It's obvious. So go.
Go to the court.
Just get a divorce!
Okay, why don't we give Tyler some space?
How'd that feel?
Awesome.
Uh, you paged?
Eight of the mice are hyperglycemic.
What?
I've been locked in this lab all day and night,
hiding it from you,
trying to understand why,
and--and Meredith Grey figured it out.
Now I've got just weeks worth of...
tests to run and mice to monitor,
real patients to check on.
Well, so you get help.
From who? I fired Kepner.
There's no way in hell I'm putting Meredith on this trial.
Oh, help will show up. Trust me.
It always does.
So...
You're gonna go home,
get some rest.
The work will be here in the morning.
Go. Right now.
Don't worry, Q.
I got your back.
He just went in blind and he hit the ventricle.
It was the most incredible thing I have ever seen.
All Sloan taught me today was how to brine a chicken.
Altman called me a chicken.
What you said to me the other day
was horrible, mean, and--
All right. You're doing it again.
You're like a friggin' mosquito.
Yeah, well, that's all changing.
Lexie, you're leading pre-rounds tomorrow.
Jackson, you're touring med students,
And, Alex, you've got nights in the E.R. for the next week.
Any of you argue with me,
and I'll take you off the O.R. board indefinitely.
I, on the other hand,
just got fired from Bailey's trial.
So I'm gonna spend the night
drinking and flirting with boys.
No. We can't do this anymore.
No more sex in the hospital.
You know, I'm chief now.
I have to act like it.
Fine. Whatever.
You--do you want to go get dinner?
Uh, sure.
It's not always easy to speak your mind.
Or we could just go home and have sex there.
Let's do that. Yeah.
Okay? Let's do that.
Okay.
Sometimes you need to be forced to do it.
Hey. You brought pizza?
No. Pizza? I made a coq au vin.
What are you-- what--
Wait. No, no, no.
What are you doing?
Not my coq au vin!
Mark, I love you.
I love how great you are with our daughter.
I love that you and Arizona are friends.
But you...
You need to leave, 'cause
tonight I'm gonna eat pizza
and drink beer in bed with my wife
and tell her all about the neck I just built,
and then we're gonna have lots and lots of sex.
Okay? We're great parents,
but we're more than just mommies and daddies.
We are hot and we are sexy,
and your new hobby--
the hollandaise and the short ribs
And the coq au vin--
is getting in the way of our sex lives.
So... please, start having sex again.
Okay? But not tonight.
'cause tonight, you're babysitting.
Can I at least have some pizza?
That was incredibly hot.
Sometimes it's better
to just keep things to yourself, though.
Play dumb...
I had a good day.
So good, in fact, I wanna break our rule
and tell you about it.
Even when your whole body's aching to come clean.
Don't.
Are you sure?
Come here.
So you shut your mouth...
keep the secret...
