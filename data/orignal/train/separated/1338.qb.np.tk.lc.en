that ain &apos;t your grandpappy &apos;s motor .
that a 454 c.i.f.e. stroker ?
sure is , flaco .
take a guess how many extra horses in there .
i don &apos;t know . like , a hundred ?
try 250 !
250 ?
love to turn that supercharged mod on .
yeah , those are new .
it &apos;s about to get hot in here .
that is so cool .
hey , make sure his old lady won &apos;t miss that cash ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s gonna lose it .
worry about your own old lady .
last call for bets on veloz and rayo .
rayo ?
who &apos;s he ?
he &apos;s turbocharged , man .
check that out , man .
that &apos;s rayo .
he &apos;s fast , brother .
i &apos;ve worked on that &apos; stang . it &apos;s not gonna beat my camaro .
you &apos;re gonna kill him , homes .
yo . take a good look at the ass @-@ end of my car .
that &apos;s all you &apos;ll be seeing tonight , cabron .
yeah ? well you &apos;ll be kissing mine after i beat you .
that &apos;s funny .
yeah , kiss his ass , cabron ! oh !
that &apos;s the plan .
it &apos;s bottle time .
you really should have a total cholesterol test .
i should have a lot of things .
i should have six months in my rainy @-@ day fund .
i should have eight hours of sleep .
i should also have a best friend who doesn &apos;t nag me .
okay , you just can &apos;t admit
that this is about your coffee addiction .
okay , so , go a day without .
okay . not today .
let &apos;s go , jimmie .
don &apos;t push , man .
there &apos;s something i do not miss -- drug arrests .
but frankie does make those street clothes
look quite good .
yo , this is an illegal arrest .
really ?
man , you know it . this is illegal .
this is not -- - so , the 15 bags of crystal meth
i found in your pocket weren &apos;t yours ?
well , maybe he was wearing someone else &apos;s pants .
uh , yeah . you heard the lady .
that &apos;s it .
come on , pal .
let &apos;s go . - hey , listen -- i was not dealing , okay ?
i might have been giving away free samples ,
but tell this clown right here
that you can &apos;t bust me for that .
do that for me , baby ?
okay , don &apos;t call me &quot; baby . &quot;
and that clown is my brother . let &apos;s go .
what are you doing talking to my prisoner ?
well , if you don &apos;t want me talking to your prisoner ,
you should be here to help .
detective rizzoli was moving him by himself .
i &apos;m on it . other rizzoli , get him upstairs .
what is your problem ?
i don &apos;t have a problem .
why is he being such a douche ?
he should be down here moving his own prisoner .
the french claim &quot; douche &quot; originated with them ,
but it &apos;s really an italian word -- &quot; doccia . &quot;
it &apos;s an ancient means of conveying water .
i &apos;m using it to convey contempt .
what are you doing ?
checking your body temperature .
well , stop .
all right .
why are you doing it ?
subtle signs of sexual arousal include a rise in temperature .
i am not aroused by martinez .
well , it is nothing to be ashamed of .
most women experience a sexual rush around bad boys .
put out your hand .
give me my coffee .
mm @-@ hmm . tremors .
you know it &apos;s too much caffeine , maura .
it &apos;s from him .
and i think he &apos;s sexy .
well , he thinks he &apos;s sexy , too .
they &apos;re at it again .
who ?
these idiot drag racers .
we got a dead one . come on .
i mean , i would like to get along with him .
i don &apos;t know why he &apos;s got to make it so hard .
okay , martinez is an alpha male .
you &apos;re an alpha female . you make him uncomfortable .
so , it &apos;s my fault ?
what do we have ?
looks like an illegal street race .
emphasis on &quot; illegal &quot; -- no witnesses .
spectators scattered when the car caught on fire .
even the hard @-@ core video @-@ heads aren &apos;t posting .
looks like he &apos;s still driving .
he &apos;s got third @-@ degree burns , likely from a flash fire .
we got a name ?
no . no plates on the car , either .
you run the vin number ?
it was removed .
we might be able to get a number off the engine .
doubt it -- street racers file the numbers off ,
and they use parts from different cars .
whatever caught fire started inside the car .
maybe nitrous ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve read about that .
street racers use nitrous @-@ oxide systems
to boost horsepower and torque .
makes the car real fast .
and you know that because ... ?
i might have added one to my mom &apos;s station wagon .
oh , my god . what happened ?
blew the engine . she grounded me for six months .
i called in the bomb squad just to be on the safe side .
all right , well , let &apos;s start looking around
for pieces of aluminum shrapnel , maybe from a nitrous tank .
jane ! hey .
what did i tell you , bro ?
jane ! what are you guys doing here ?
oh , well , they make us show up when there &apos;s a dead guy .
what are you doing here ?
ah , just passing by ,
you know , moving through .
so you missed the race ?
what race ? hey . can i get a quick shot of you
for , uh , candidgram ?
it &apos;s this cool thing i &apos;m doing .
i &apos;m documenting every second --
my whole life , i mean -- with video selfies .
your whole life ? every second ?
did you get any , uh , video selfies this morning ?
oh , yeah , yeah . so rad . even got the explosion .
so , you weat the race .
yeah . poor veloz .
you know his full name ?
ah , h @-@ he &apos;s a one @-@ namer , like madonna .
hey , you know &quot; veloz &quot; means &quot; super fast &quot; ?
yeah .
i had this , uh --
this hot latina girlfriend , diana .
she was pretty veloz . you know what i mean ?
okay , giovanni . give me your phone .
why ?
because you recorded the race .
how do you know that ?
hand it over .
no .
no ? how &apos;s the alfa ?
sweet .
i &apos;m gonna put a turbo on it , try to take on these v @-@ 8s .
yeah ? you want to call me before ?
maybe i &apos;ll come watch you race .
yeah , i will .
no . wait . street racing is illegal .
i &apos;ll have to seize your car .
wait . what ?
yeah . unless ...
unless what ?
unless we can find something in the footage on your phone .
okay .
just -- just don &apos;t delete anything .
a @-@ and ignore me and my bros in the jacuzzi
with the irish ... setter .
oh , my god .
frost , i think giovanni recorded the race .
could you look on his phone ?
that &apos;s great , jane .
might have found a piece of the tank .
see how it curves in there ?
that means the explosive was attached
to the outside of the tank , right ?
may i ?
it &apos;s not nitrous oxide .
it &apos;s propane .
well , if it &apos;s propane , it &apos;s murder .
well , i &apos;ll need to confirm , of course .
yeah , that &apos;s what it smells like .
sorry , b.t. sarron -- lead investigator .
&quot; b.t. &quot; ?
as in &quot; brandon thomas ... &quot;
though everyone seems to think it &apos;s for &quot; bomb tech . &quot;
yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure he had a nitrous @-@ oxide tank ,
and it was filled with propane .
well , that doesn &apos;t seem like a mistake
a savvy drag racer would make .
got something .
it &apos;s part of a blasting cap .
so it wasn &apos;t a mistake .
somebody rigged this car to explode .
ooh . nice oven mitts .
thank you . they cheer me up .
205 degrees celsius .
somebody overcooked the thanksgiving turkey .
nothing too exciting over there .
eh , i &apos;ll eventually get all the shrapnel .
it &apos;s concentrated in the posterior regions
of the shoulder , neck , and head , but he &apos;s still too hot .
speaking of too hot , where &apos;s b.t. ?
b.t. who ?
funny .
actually , since your last boyfriend
was dennis the serial killer , i &apos;m all for b.t.
do you think there are any fingers left in these gloves ?
like , i would love some prints .
what , we got another body coming in ?
in a manner of speaking .
we &apos;re doing the vehicle autopsy here .
wh-- in the morgue ?
in here ? you can &apos;t do that .
well , of course i can . it &apos;s part of my office .
and b.t. wants to be in close proximity to the crime lab
in order to facilitate his examination of the car .
or his examination of the medical examiner .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
come here .
wh @-@ what are you doing ?
i &apos;m taking your temperature .
it &apos;s a subtle sign of sexual arousal .
he &apos;s a very nice man .
he has a phd in applied physics , and he practices yoga .
and why would you like that , a yogi with a phd ?
he &apos;s so hideous to look at , too .
i said he was nice .
okay .
can you find some fingers in there , please ,
&apos;cause i really need an i.d. ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
the test of true love -- will he be disgusted
when he finds you wearing the dead man &apos;s fingertips ?
hmm . i don &apos;t know . let &apos;s find out .
hello .
hey .
so , uh , the camaro &apos;s ready to be autopsied ?
i hope it &apos;s not an inconvenience .
you know , it just seemed easier to do it
closer to the crime lab .
are you wearing his fingers ?
that &apos;s remarkable .
i @-@ i &apos;ve heard of this technique ,
but i never thought i &apos;d get to see it in action .
oh , yes , well , there &apos;s always action
here in the crime lab .
how did you do it ?
well , i immersed his fingers in a rehydration solution .
sodium carbonate ?
yes .
10 grams ?
yes , with ethanol .
95 % pure ?
along with distilled water .
okay , and for those of us planning to not try this at home ,
can we get to the graphite powder , please ?
oh , yes , of course .
hmm . we might get a print off the index finger .
that &apos;s not bad .
absolutely incredible .
okay , i &apos;m gonna scan it , run it through afis .
maura , will you do the other fingers for me , please ?
maura ?
what ?
the other fingers .
oh . yeah , sure . of course .
okay .
here &apos;s what i found on giovanni &apos;s phone .
so , i &apos;m pretty stoked to see
this camaro and mustang hit the track .
maybe i can surprise them with my alfa .
i &apos;m still hoping to get a hit on his prints .
if i can crowbar a v @-@ 6 with a turbo in there ,
it &apos;d be a small monster .
got him -- alberto santana .
he was paroled after doing a year and a half
into a five @-@ year sentence for auto theft .
i want to talk to the driver of that mustang .
there &apos;s not a single good angle of his face .
ohh , this is hard to watch .
ouch . that was not good , man .
our victim &apos;s last known address was a halfway house .
i want to get in touch with his parole officer .
okay .
jane , you got to see this .
i &apos;m telling you -- these freaks are serious out here .
okay , 25k on the race ?
$ 25,000 ?
a really good driver gets a third .
so , that &apos;s like $ 8,000 . it could be enough to commit murder .
can you show me what giovanni has
on the other driver ?
giovanni mostly shoots giovanni .
this is all i &apos;ve got .
... after i beat you .
how many red 2005 mustangs
do we have registered in massachusetts ?
too many . i found 539 .
wha-- we got to go through all of them ?
can frankie help ?
i already tried . martinez is using him for something .
oh , goodie . giovani &apos;s in the cafe .
i &apos;d take him off your hands for you ...
... but i hear he &apos;s a face licker .
not my face .
hey , jane .
i hope you haven &apos;t put him in any danger out there .
he &apos;s in more danger in here --
of choking to death , ma .
you know who this is ?
mnh . nope .
mrs. rizz ,
this is the best plain spaghetti and meatballs
in the history of italy .
i &apos;m gonna look really good driving your alfa .
i want to know his name , and i want to know it now .
honest to god , jane , i don &apos;t know .
they -- they called him &quot; rayo , &quot;
which means , uh , &quot; lightning bolt . &quot;
man , i wish i had a cool nickname .
why didn &apos;t you mention this rayo before ?
you didn &apos;t ask . can i have my fork back ?
hey , you think maybe i &apos;ll get
a plaque or medal or something for my help solving this ?
it &apos;s not solved , giovanni .
well , i gave you all the pieces .
can &apos;t help it if you can &apos;t put them together .
that &apos;s it . you --
if you &apos;re gonna stab someone , start with your father .
hey , how &apos;s he doing ?
i heard he , uh , got himself a real fine lady .
shut up !
hey , ang .
hi , sean .
everything all right ?
yeah .
&quot; ang &quot; ?
what &apos;s next , a little pda ?
what &apos;s pda ?
public display of affection .
you shut up .
don &apos;t talk with your mouth full .
you need any help here ?
no .
do me a favor -- try this meatball .
shut up .
what are you doing ? !
yeah , but there &apos;s no indication of a timing mechanism .
this has got to be an r.c.i.e.d.
radio @-@ controlled improvised explosive device .
it &apos;s so refreshing to have someone else
translate the acronym .
yeah -- well , you know , the blasting cap we found ,
the way the car blew ,
tells me we &apos;re looking for a wireless detonator .
i &apos;m gonna build an n.o.s. prototype .
and that &apos;s standard , correct ?
in order to know what caused the explosion ,
you try to re @-@ create it ?
yes .
i just hope they found pieces of the transmitter .
and the transmitter could be anything
that emits an r.f. signal --
a radio , a cordless phone , a key fob .
i love that you know that .
this could be a micro s.d. card .
jane said that the racers put cameras in their cars .
she asked me to look for anything
that might suggest the presence of a video camera .
you know , i noticed what looked like
remnants of a rubber ring on the dashboard .
i wonder if he had a suction @-@ cup mount there ?
it &apos;s a good place for a mini action camera .
you know , if we can recover what &apos;s on this card ,
it &apos;s possible the victim recorded
his own vehicle as it exploded .
maura found a micro s.d. card in the debris .
she thinks there was a camera inside the car .
they get anything off of it ?
well , the crime lab &apos;s looking at it now .
b.t. is convinced we &apos;re looking at an explosion
triggered by a wireless device .
i want to go through giovanni &apos;s footage again .
okay , see if there &apos;s anyone in the crowd
holding something that could be a transmitter .
okay .
i got a hold of the victim &apos;s parole officer .
elizabeth keating -- she &apos;s with the family .
i was just about to go through the footage again .
i &apos;ll take frost . come on .
thanks for meeting with us , officer keating .
sure -- uh , thank you for letting me be the one
to break the news to his wife .
i &apos;ve known them both for three years .
it -- it &apos;s such a shame .
alberto was one of the good ones .
you know , he was always on time , always working .
what was his job here ?
uh , mechanic . he was really good .
this is his father @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s garage .
alberto was trying to buy it .
on a mechanic &apos;s salary ?
is that why he was racing ?
i had no idea he was racing again .
we think someone from that world --
maybe even the driver he was racing against --
sabotaged his car .
alberto did time for using stolen parts
to rebuild engines .
any indication he was back into that ?
no .
no , his wife and i both worked to --
to keep him on the straight and narrow .
did he mention anyone he was having a problem with ,
a customer maybe ?
no .
i wish i could be more helpful .
alberto promised me .
he promised me that he wasn &apos;t gonna race .
i &apos;m sorry to have to tell you
that &apos;s how he died , mrs. santana .
elizabeth just said that it was a car accident .
alberto &apos;s files might be important .
we &apos;d like to look through them all .
go ahead .
it &apos;s hard to accept that alberto &apos;s death
wasn &apos;t an accident .
we &apos;re still investigating , sir .
did you know he was racing ?
no .
so , you didn &apos;t know any of the people
he might have been associating with ?
he knew better than to talk to me about his racing days .
i can &apos;t believe he was doing that again .
i know alberto was just trying to make things better
for me and the baby , pablo .
he didn &apos;t have to race .
i should have just given you two the garage .
papi . papi .
papi , it &apos;s not your fault .
who &apos;s that in the photo with alberto ?
that &apos;s alberto and his sister , cassandra .
she &apos;s beautiful .
she died of a drug overdose ,
and that &apos;s why alberto hated drugs .
did alberto have a speciality ,
something people sought him out for ?
yeah , he was a genius with motors --
guys who wanted horsepower , but didn &apos;t want flash .
he -- he &apos;d put big motors in little crap cars .
what about his camaro ? did he work on that here ?
alberto drove an old toyota .
the only camaro i know he worked on
was an old &apos; 88 .
who was the customer ?
i don &apos;t know .
did you notice anything about
your husband &apos;s behavior recently ?
it might be nothing .
but it &apos;s worrying you . so , could be something .
he -- he was spending a lot of time here .
he was nervous , but ...
i thought it was because of the baby .
but now i know that there was something wrong .
and the crime lab couldn &apos;t get anything off the s.d. card ?
not yet .
well , i went through the footage frame by frame .
um , i couldn &apos;t see all the spectators ,
but the ones that i did see weren &apos;t holding anything .
so --
thank you .
thought you said you ordered something good .
this good .
it &apos;s kale .
it &apos;s that thing on the salad bar that nobody used to eat ,
but now it &apos;s the cool food .
are you abstaining from coffee tomorrow ?
no , i &apos;m abstaining from kale .
no , you have a family history of cholesterol .
you need to take that test .
you &apos;re very nosey .
i &apos;m very concerned .
hey , i &apos;ve got an idea -- bother b.t.
we haven &apos;t progressed to the point
where we &apos;re exchanging genetic dna family histories yet .
you exchanged any dna yet ?
we &apos;ve been too busy .
you know , he is doing a prototype
of the nitrous @-@ oxide system
to determine where the charges were placed .
i apologize for the interruption ,
but , uh , i finished the prototype .
oh , that &apos;s wonderful .
yes , it sure is .
would you like to join us ?
i can &apos;t -- yeah , i &apos;m standing by at the crime lab .
they &apos;re making progress on that s.d. card .
oh , that &apos;s great . okay .
um , i &apos;ll call detective frost and see if he wants to help .
or , uh ...
you know , dr. isles is very good at ...
standing by .
aren &apos;t you , dr. isles ?
i mean , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s your find ,
so you both should be there ,
you know , in case they recover something .
okay . uh , no . but wait -- what about you ?
i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t want to just leave you here alone
with -- with your kale .
oh , i digest my leafy greens so much better when i &apos;m alone .
go . i @-@ it &apos;s almost 6 : 00 a.m. in afghanistan .
casey will keep me company .
okay .
see you .
bye .
can i join you for a beer ?
no , it doesn &apos;t go with my meal .
i &apos;m sorry about this morning .
okay , thanks .
let me buy you a drink . it &apos;ll be like old times .
and why are you suddenly being so nice to me now ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
yes , you do .
i only came by to give you these .
now you &apos;re giving me my car back ?
dcu doesn &apos;t need it anymore .
why ? because it got burned in an operation ?
what ? you don &apos;t want it back ?
no , i do . yeah , raff , i do .
i @-@ i do !
thank you .
you come over here and offer me a beer ,
give me my car back .
if i was a suspicious person ,
i might think you wanted something from me .
like what ?
what do you got that i want ?
don &apos;t do this .
don &apos;t do what ?
we were good together ...
when we didn &apos;t talk .
don &apos;t , raff .
i -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m involved with someone .
he &apos;s not here .
we have to work together .
no , we don &apos;t .
i found it !
b.t. , i found it !
morning .
what time did you get in ?
i didn &apos;t go home .
any luck on the s.d. card ?
uh , no .
any luck with b.t. ?
sorry . were you talking to me ?
is this what i think it is ?
i don &apos;t believe it . you &apos;re incredible .
yes , she is . what is it ?
i think it &apos;s the receiver .
yeah , th @-@ the boston marathon bombers triggered the blasts
with toy remote controls .
this receiver proves my theory .
someone at the race triggered the explosion .
can you give me an idea of its range ?
please don &apos;t tell me you don &apos;t like to guess , either .
yeah , i actually do hate to guess .
well , i won &apos;t hold it against you .
ask her .
th @-@ the type of circuitry used in this receiver
limits its range .
i &apos;d say it wouldn &apos;t be reliable beyond 100 feet .
thank you .
and don &apos;t be insulted , but i &apos;m sending frost down here
to help you with that s.d. card .
nah , you were right , jane . no one &apos;s close enough .
unless there &apos;s someone in one of those buildings ,
the only one close enough when that car explodes
is the other driver .
we got to find him .
before we begin our presentation ,
sergeant korsak , i &apos;d like to acknowledge
your work on the computer today .
thank you , detective frost .
i hope i &apos;m about to acknowledge
your work on the s.d. card , detective frost .
you are , detective rizzoli .
look at this .
okay , that &apos;s alberto .
it &apos;s bottle time .
damn . - he thought he was turning on his secret weapon --
the nitrous tank .
frost , can you play that back from the beginning ?
okay . slow it down .
go a frame at a time .
stop .
who does that look like ?
no way .
lieutenant martinez was at that race .
and you &apos;ve already poked around on the down low ?
yes , sir .
and according to martinez &apos;s secretary ,
he hasn &apos;t been in the office much at all for a while .
what did frankie say ?
well , i didn &apos;t want to put him in that position .
well , that &apos;s the right call . martinez is his boss .
so , what do we do ?
we try and talk to him .
do you know how many messages we &apos;ve left ?
okay . so we wait .
sir , we &apos;re investigating a homicide
that llieutenant martinez witnessed
and didn &apos;t bother to tell us about .
i got that , detective .
do you know what happens if i get into it
with the chief of detectives ?
no , sir .
well , why don &apos;t you tell him , vince ?
we start a ball rolling we can &apos;t stop .
it could be the end of martinez &apos;s career .
you got that ?
if you &apos;re gonna go to the principal &apos;s office
to complain about somebody ,
make sure you want that somebody expelled .
give the guy a chance to explain himself .
yes , sir .
how long we gonna give him , vince ?
he &apos;s got a reason . i know he &apos;s got a reason .
better be a really good one .
i &apos;ve been through two years of alberto &apos;s receipts here .
these are the invoices from the last few jobs alberto did .
there &apos;s a handwritten note in spanish
attached to this invoice .
this invoice has a vin number . will you run that ?
yeah , sure .
what &apos;s the note say ?
en inglés , por favor .
&quot; front seat , heat on full , brake ,
left signal , recline . &quot;
huh ?
got me .
vin number is for a mustang .
the parts are for a stroker kit .
well , somebody was getting their mustang ready for a drag race .
why would alberto be souping up a competitor &apos;s mustang ?
who &apos;s it registered to ?
miguel ortiz --
no address , just a p.o. box in jamaica plain .
damn .
hmm . looks like miguel doesn &apos;t pay his parking tickets .
he got two dozen in the last month .
see if he &apos;s been ticketed in the same place more than once .
nice , jane .
he got five out front of 1268 boston street .
it looks like a warehouse .
and that &apos;s enough for a search warrant . let &apos;s get it .
why did we sneak in when we already have a search warrant ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s more fun this way .
best to do a search before the bad guys
know what &apos;s going on . look .
well , well , well , what do we have here ?
hello , sweetness .
keys are still in it .
korsak , you got that list ?
oh , yeah .
it &apos;s &quot; front seat ... &quot;
yeah .
... &quot; heat on full ... &quot;
... &quot; brake ...
... &quot; left signal ...
recline . &quot;
what are you doing ?
patience , detective .
when you come into the country ,
border patrol searches your car with the doors open , right ?
right .
try again .
i know .
&quot; front seat , heat to full ,
&quot; brake ...
left signal , recline . &quot;
well , what do you know ?
that was a sequence to open a hide .
and it looks like our friend miguel was drug trafficking .
this one &apos;s coffee .
this one smells like cayenne pepper .
it &apos;s to throw the dogs off .
his wife said alberto was worried .
maybe it wasn &apos;t just racing he was into .
well , alberto was working on this mustang .
you think he was being forced to build hides ?
boston police ! freeze !
frankie , what are you doing here ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
well , i have a funny feeling we just walked
into the middle of an undercover operation .
yeah , you sure did .
which is why you should trust your colleagues
and share your information .
we &apos;re separate operations , rizzoli .
what is wrong with you ?
whose side are you on , martinez ?
better start talking , raffie .
oh , don &apos;t make us threaten you .
what do you mean , threaten us ?
he didn &apos;t tell you , did he ?
lieutenant martinez watched our victim
get blown up this morning .
he knew we were investigating a homicide ,
and he still didn &apos;t come forward .
he didn &apos;t tell us he was friends with our prime suspect , either .
this is detective first grade
miguel ortiz -- nypd .
you &apos;re a cop ?
yeah .
i brought miguel in .
i &apos;ve been doing this in new york --
infiltrating these street @-@ race groups as a driver .
that &apos;s how a lot of meth is getting moved .
in hides ?
yeah .
since when did meth become a problem in boston ?
since it blew into town about six months ago .
dealers have been popping up , giving away free samples .
dealers -- like jimmie washington ?
is that why you barked at me about talking to your prisoner ?
it was need to know , jane . i couldn &apos;t tell you .
wait , wait , wait -- so , whoever &apos;s running this thing
created his own market by handing out free meth ?
yeah , we don &apos;t who the unsub is ,
but we know this guy --
chapo benavidez ,
an ms @-@ 13 gangbanger from boston .
he broke his parole two years ago
and fled to juarez , mexico .
he runs a methamphetamine lab from there .
he &apos;s been getting it to new york distributors .
but now it &apos;s found its way into boston ,
thanks to your unknown subject .
yeah .
so , who is this guy ?
jorge vega -- big meth dealer .
he runs all the street races .
it took us three months to get close to jorge .
after the explosion ,
he finally hired me to be a delivery driver .
so now you just sit tight and wait for the call
for that next load of meth .
exactly . any second now .
did alberto build the hide in your mustang ?
no , no . jorge builds the hides .
he hired alberto to do the engine work ,
and then he found out he could drive .
wait . so , alberto wasn &apos;t a part of this ?
so , why is he working on your mustang ?
he thought it was jorge &apos;s .
the mustang is registered to me , but jorge owns the cars .
that &apos;s how he controls the races .
they &apos;re fixed ?
no ! jorge &apos;s a cheater , too ?
alberto didn &apos;t know that .
he thought the races were clean .
but after he &apos;d worked on the engines ,
jorge would load in a new fuel map .
so , we got means --
it isn &apos;t hard for jorge to switch propane for nitrous .
motive -- alberto found the hide in your mustang .
and opportunity -- jorge owned
the camaro that alberto drove .
he couldn &apos;t have triggered the explosion , though .
yeah , he was at the starting line . he was too far away .
so we &apos;re still looking for a second killer .
it &apos;s jorge . it &apos;s him .
rizzoli , please . hold off on arresting jorge .
we just need a little more time .
look , we &apos;re not gonna step on
another units &apos; operations , all right ?
do you have jorge under surveillance ?
yeah .
all right , so he &apos;s not going anywhere .
you sure he &apos;ll roll ?
he will if we get him with the drugs .
well , then why are we standing here ?
let &apos;s go get them all .
am i supposed to thank you for letting me come along
on what should be our arrest ?
sure , if you want to .
stop .
what ?
i am not gonna look at you ,
and you are not gonna make me smile .
how much you want to bet ?
you think i don &apos;t know that you do this to every woman ?
do what ?
pay attention . jorge &apos;s pulling into the lot .
okay , that &apos;s jorge in the blue civic .
those are his boys in the truck .
well , there &apos;s your meth .
it officially sucks . this one &apos;s yours .
thank you , jane .
you &apos;re welcome .
why are you still sitting here ?
that is a lot of meth .
that &apos;s it . yeah , you run , jorge .
here we go . oh . get him .
boston police ! down on the ground ! down on the ground !
now , cabron ! down on the ground !
let &apos;s see some hands right here .
got him ?
i got him , papi .
meth party &apos;s over , jorge .
jorge &apos;s lawyered up . my guess is he &apos;s afraid of this guy .
well , at least he can &apos;t run .
his bail was set at half a million .
dcu hasn &apos;t found anything
at his house or his business yet ,
which means if we don &apos;t find that transmitter ,
we can &apos;t connect jorge to alberto &apos;s murder .
i got bad news .
jorge &apos;s lawyer just showed up with the bail money .
great .
huh . next stop , mexico .
wow , kudos to you , martinez .
i &apos;m so happy we just stood back
and let you complete your operation .
time for the bpd shuffle .
the what , sir ?
you would be amazed at how slow
sergeant collins in booking is --
can &apos;t find the ink , the camera won &apos;t work .
oh , vinnie , you &apos;re my boy .
no , no , no , no , do not smile .
you are not allowed to smile .
why not ?
isn &apos;t it good that guys sometimes
get lost in the system ?
hey , reggie , it &apos;s vince . i need a favor . sure .
i searched jorge &apos;s civic again .
he had a hide .
how did you get it open ?
persistence .
look what i found in his dash .
ah . nice work , bro .
it &apos;s a programmer for car @-@ alarm systems .
so , you can use that
to program a key fob , right ? yeah .
we need to get that to b.t. , because if we can match that
to the receiver that maura found ,
we don &apos;t need jorge &apos;s transmitter .
hey , reg , i need you to slow a guy down for me -- jorge vega .
hairline crack in the receiver , but i think i fixed it .
we &apos;re about to try it .
okay , turn on the programmer .
jane , the programmer is set
to the same frequency as the receiver .
okay , maura , thanks .
we don &apos;t need the transmitter to nail jorge .
he planted the propane bomb .
what we need now is the second killer .
whoever triggered it .
alberto worked on all of jorge &apos;s cars ,
but he had invoices and receipts .
so , it was on the up and up .
yeah .
but what would you do if you were trying to stay clean
and you discovered that the guy you drove for
was a drug smuggler ?
alberto &apos;s parole would get revoked
if he knowingly worked on cars
with hides that were moving drugs .
exactly .
plus he lost his beloved sister
to a drug overdose -- he hated drugs .
he told someone about that hide ,
and that &apos;s what got him killed .
the only thing that alberto , jorge , and chapo
had in common was time .
they all did time .
not in the same prison .
they still have a connection .
everyone on this list
is involved in a drug @-@ distribution ring
run by jorge vega .
jorge is my parolee . he was distributing drugs ?
dcu arrested him today for drug trafficking .
he had over 100 kilos of methamphetamine .
is there anybody else on that list
that &apos;s one of your parolees ?
i don &apos;t believe this .
nearly all of them .
oh , excuse me .
would you like some more coffee ?
yeah ?
no , i &apos;m good . thanks .
we &apos;re ready for you .
you must have had a great vacation . you &apos;re so tan .
okay .
i did . i just got back from a mediterranean cruise .
nice .
okay , thanks . i &apos;ll be right there .
thanks , ma .
did you know that alberto was working on jorge &apos;s cars ?
i didn &apos;t know that .
you -- you don &apos;t think that jorge
had anything to do with alberto &apos;s murder , do you ?
we &apos;re not sure .
there might be something
that you could do that could help us .
anything you need .
this shouldn &apos;t take too long .
i &apos;m happy to help .
oh , hello , sergeant , detective .
homeland security has a nice photo of you
crossing the border in el paso on your way to juarez .
what ?
third time this year .
must really like it there . nice tan .
maybe you got it visiting chapo ?
excuse me ?
you remember chapo , right ?
he &apos;s pretty famous .
he runs the biggest meth lab in juarez .
wha-- &quot; chapo &quot; is a @-@ a nickname .
it -- it simply means &quot; shorty . &quot;
carlos &quot; chapo &quot; benavidez -- you know him , right ?
oh , he &apos;s one of my parolee skips .
help me understand where you &apos;re going with this .
dr. isles , you want to take that one ?
of course .
as you know ,
jorge drained the nitrous oxide in alberto &apos;s tank ,
and he filled it with propane .
what do you mean , as i know ? what are you talking about ?
two blasting caps like these
were duct @-@ taped to the tank .
we going too fast for you ?
well , tell us if you need us to slow down .
the first blast blew a hole in the aluminum tank ,
allowing pressurized propane gas to escape into alberto &apos;s car .
the second blast ignited the propane .
we found a receiver
under the front bumper of alberto &apos;s car .
we think the transmitter is a key fob .
you have your keys on you , right ?
yes , but i don &apos;t --
get them out .
push the lock button .
now .
it &apos;s a simulation , of course ,
but you just blew a hole in the aluminum tank .
now push the unlock button .
i guess you remember that --
watching alberto &apos;s car explode .
no .
why would i kill my own parolee ?
you forgot that part , too ?
alberto found a hide when he was working on one of jorge &apos;s cars .
and he did the right thing .
he told his parole officer .
he didn &apos;t know you were also
boston &apos;s biggest crystal @-@ meth dealer
and jorge &apos;s boss .
you have a nickname . did you know that ?
we &apos;ve been calling you &quot; unsub . &quot;
you and jorge killed alberto to save your drug business .
oh , god .
i want a lawyer .
yeah . get a good one .
jorge &apos;s already trying to make a deal .
you &apos;re under arrest
for the murder of alberto santana .
what ? where &apos;s you hot date with b.t. ?
i heard you &apos;d been fending of martinez .
he tried . wanted to celebrate .
you know , i am troubled that it was a woman running this methamphetamine operation .
which actually worries me .
why ?
because it ... suggests i might be sexist .
i am more troubled by that fact that she was a parole officer .
i mean , she &apos;s supposed to be one of us .
you &apos;re eating kale !
i &apos;m playing with kale .
does that count as a serving of dark leafy greens ?
no .
guess what ?
you know i can &apos;t guess .
i &apos;m gonna have coffee tomorrow .
jane ...
and a next day !
you &apos;re impossible .
i know !
eat your kale .
ok . but i &apos;m having french fries for dessert .
of course , you are .
