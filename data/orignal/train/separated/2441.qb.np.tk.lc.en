damon is gone .
i want you to compel me to forget that
i ever loved him .
who is damon salvatore ?
he was a monster .
to get home , we &apos;ll harness the power of the eclipse
using a mystical relic .
no .
vampires murdered my wife .
and i &apos;m gonna get him to name all his vampire buddies .
need any help ?
if even just a small , little part of you came back to check on me ...
then stay .
not doing so great , damon .
because i &apos;m lost , brother .
it &apos;s a hell of a long story , brother ,
but i &apos;m back .
please just let me go .
i know this may seem a little barbaric ,
but i promise you , it &apos;s nothing personal .
why are you doing this ?
it &apos;s a longer story than we have time for ,
but--trust me--you don &apos;t want this life ...
if you can call it that .
all right . come on .
come on . come on .
come on .
what &apos;s that ? what is that ?
what is happening ?
i missed you , too , buddy .
i can &apos;t believe it .
i thought you were gone .
you didn &apos;t think i was gone gone , huh ?
promised you an eternity of misery .
he &apos;s back ?
how ?
i don &apos;t know .
honestly , everything stefan said
after , &quot; damon is back , &quot; is kind of a blur .
what about bonnie ?
she sacrificed herself so i can come back .
i don &apos;t want anyone to know .
there &apos;s no sense making this harder than it already is .
what are we gonna tell people ?
he said that she wasn &apos;t over there .
where is there , exactly ?
mystic falls , 1994 ?
i know .
a bunch of witches were gonna get together
and create some space @-@ time purgatory ,
you &apos;d think they &apos;d pick a better year than
the one that kurt cobain killed himself .
whole thing was just very depressing .
so how did you get back ?
long story--big flash of light ,
two decades &apos; worth of jet lag .
i will explain all of my adventures
in that flannel hellscape , but first ,
there &apos;s someone i got to go see .
i don &apos;t want to see him .
i get it ,
but that &apos;s how you feel now , elena .
if you thought there was even a chance you &apos;d see damon again ,
you would have never asked me to compel away
your memories of loving him .
she did what ?
she had alaric do it .
damon is going to kill me .
you &apos;re unkillable .
doesn &apos;t mean he won &apos;t try .
what do you think is gonna happen when i do see him ?
i just need to see her , stefan .
our eyes will meet , fireworks will go off ,
and the balance of nature will be restored .
she loves me .
he &apos;s a psychotic killer .
you only feel that way because i erased all the good parts .
i don &apos;t see anything that could balance out the bad .
promise me you won &apos;t lift the compulsion .
promise me .
i won &apos;t , ok ,
not until you ask me to .
thank you .
but , elena ,
i hope you ask me .
i have to go . i have a shift at the hospital .
since when ?
since damon came back and i &apos;m trying desperately to avoid him .
fine , but if you &apos;re avoiding people ,
add jo to your list .
i compelled her to forget our date the other night ,
and it didn &apos;t take .
what do you mean , it didn &apos;t take ?
well , either she &apos;s on vervain
or there &apos;s some other reason ,
but she can &apos;t be compelled .
so see if you can find out why .
ok . yeah . i will .
will you call jeremy ?
i had to tell him about bonnie over the phone .
you can imagine how that went .
where are you going ?
out .
you promised me you &apos;d help me track down my relatives .
just ... later , ok ?
jeremy , you can &apos;t just say , &quot; zach salvatore was your dad .
too bad he &apos;s dead , &quot; and then , &quot; peace out . &quot;
i can &apos;t do this right now .
what is so urgent to make you
finally unglue your ass from the couch ?
i know it &apos;s not school . it &apos;s not work .
if it &apos;s another girl , i &apos;d shower first .
i just need to get out of here .
tripp &apos;s errand boy returns .
my bad .
that &apos;s all right , mate .
just lean in , and i &apos;ll take it right from the tap .
i &apos;ll pass .
yeah ? come on .
i &apos;m gonna need my strength back for when you help me escape .
sorry . if stefan turned you in ,
i &apos;m guessing you deserved it .
when did stefan &apos;s moral compass become the new true north ?
wasn &apos;t he the one who scurried off to some poxy , little town
while he let everyone believe he was still searching for his brother ?
not exactly the hero move , if you ask me .
still , i think the general population is safer with you in here .
yeah . probably right ,
well , except for elena ...
stefan , caroline , you .
what do you think would happen
if i were to tell your boss about known vampires
and their groupies ?
well , savannah was a waste of gas .
minus a few blood bags , the house you told us about was empty .
odd . must have smelled you coming .
would have been a total bust ,
except i happened upon a girl
that fit the description that you gave me .
that was near whitmore ,
500 miles from where you said she was gonna be .
is this ivy ?
that &apos;s the one .
so i &apos;m gonna give you today to conjure up
the location of your vampire friends ,
or you and i are gonna go sightseeing
in mystic falls .
why didn &apos;t you tell us enzo has been locked up this whole time ?
honestly , i didn &apos;t know anybody was missing him .
matt !
i &apos;m sorry .
i was confused about which vampires we like
and which ones we don &apos;t .
ok . well , what about ivy ? is she there , too ?
tripp drove her and two others across the border last night .
oh , god .
well , do you know where tripp is now ?
he &apos;s running down another lead ,
but he didn &apos;t tell me what it was .
well , can you find out ?
we need to know who his next target is .
if enzo talks , it &apos;ll be you guys .
well , that &apos;s not going to happen
because we &apos;re busting him out , right ,
if for no other reason than so i can kick his ass
for getting caught in the first place .
you have any idea how he even managed to get his hands on it ?
he didn &apos;t . i turned him in .
who is it ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
i just wanted to talk .
i can &apos;t , not now .
look . i know why you did what you did .
it &apos;s not real .
you know what &apos;s real ? the way you felt for me .
you once told me that it was the most real thing
you ever felt in your life .
those feelings are gone .
come on , elena .
you &apos;ve compelled enough people to know
it &apos;s just a way of covering the truth ,
and no matter how badly you want it done ,
it doesn &apos;t make it any less of a lie ,
you know ?
oh , i hear you breathing .
you have no idea how long i &apos;ve wanted to hear you breathe .
just open the door , elena .
everything can go back to the way it was .
just--
just open the door , elena , please ...
or , at the very least , step aside
because i &apos;m gonna kick this door in .
seriously ? you jumped out of a window ?
what if somebody saw you ?
i know , i know . i panicked . i don &apos;t know .
look . he &apos;s been trapped over there alone for months .
he just wants to see you .
look . i get how i &apos;m supposed to feel ,
but i know how i actually feel ,
and i &apos;m happy now .
what if i look at him and my old feelings
break through the compulsion ?
they won &apos;t , but even if they did ,
is that such a bad thing ?
yeah . i started over just like you did , ok ?
i made a smart choice for myself and for my future .
stefan , i kissed liam last night .
please forget that you told me that
and definitely do not tell damon that .
because he &apos;s gonna kill him , right ,
just like he killed my brother .
i was gonna say because he &apos;ll be heartbroken .
listen . what do you want to do ?
i mean , you have to see him eventually .
i know , but i just don &apos;t think eventually can be today , all right ?
i &apos;m not--
i &apos;m just not ... ready .
i got to go .
elena .
i didn &apos;t think you were here today .
yeah . no . i changed my schedule around .
ok .
follow me .
sarah , what are you doing ?
could ask you the same question .
you can &apos;t be in here .
from the look on your face ,
either you &apos;re downloading porn
or you &apos;re not supposed to be here , either .
what are you doing in tripp &apos;s office ?
what do you want ?
information on some people who used to live here .
you know anything about the salvatores ?
not really .
according to jeremy ,
zach salvatore was my dad .
he supposedly died from an animal attack ,
and , coincidentally , so did my mom ,
but i &apos;ve been paying attention .
i know what that &apos;s code for ,
and your boss seems to know a lot
about homicidal wildlife , so--
so you thought breaking in here was a good idea .
guess we have that in common .
now , either you help me or start coming up
with a good lie when i tell your boss you were snooping .
animal attacks are filed over there .
professor saltzman .
what , couldn &apos;t compel yourself a ph.d. ?
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re back .
i am .
so ... how the hell are you ?
well , let &apos;s see , ric .
i clawed my way out of some retro pocket universe ,
only to find that i needed to compel myself
a new change of clothes
because this antimagic hamster ball
is keeping me from going home ,
and then i find out that my best friend ,
rather than doing anything about it ,
decided that it was the best use of his time
to compel my beautiful and lovely girlfriend
to forget that she ever loved me .
i &apos;m great , ric . thanks for asking .
look , damon .
i know she was a train wreck without me , ok ,
but a full mind erase , seriously ?
she loved you too much , and it was killing her .
well , i &apos;m flattered ,
but i &apos;m back .
so let &apos;s get this uncompulsion on the books , huh ?
fine , as soon as elena tells me that what she wants .
right . here &apos;s the thing .
she &apos;s not gonna want to be uncompelled
if she can &apos;t remember why she &apos;d want to be uncompelled .
chicken , egg .
i know , and i &apos;m sorry .
sorry ? she won &apos;t even see me , ric .
i get it , damon , but she &apos;s happy ,
and i &apos;m not gonna take that away from her
until she asks me to .
it &apos;s not like i don &apos;t want elena to be happy .
i just want her to be happy with me .
right .
look . enzo wasn &apos;t being careful .
tripp would &apos;ve caught him eventually ,
and that meant danger for all of us .
right . so you handed enzo over
ao we wouldn &apos;t be targeted ,
and now you &apos;re rescuing him so we won &apos;t be targeted .
way to go .
well , i thought tripp was gonna kill him .
i didn &apos;t think he was gonna keep him alive for information .
well , in that case ,
sounds like you were just being practical .
so did you rat out ivy , too ?
what ?
well , you didn &apos;t want to deal with her anymore .
you wanted her gone , and now she is .
you know what ? you really should write tripp a thank @-@ you note .
hold on a second . enzo turns ivy , right ?
a hunter kills her , and yet i &apos;m the bad guy ?
i &apos;m not the one threatening to turn in
other vampires to save his own skin .
the only one who &apos;s turned in other vampires
is you , stephan .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re helping--
guilt for getting damon &apos;s friend captured .
yeah . damon is my brother ,
and i gave up on him first .
enzo didn &apos;t .
so if rescuing his idiot friend is gonna somehow make it up to him ,
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m gonna do .
great . good for you .
let me know when you figure out
how you &apos;re gonna make everything up to me .
let &apos;s get in there .
where the hell is he ?
i like your bracelet . what is it made of ?
no idea .
while you &apos;re here , can i get your opinion on something ?
sure . yeah .
female patient--
blunt @-@ force trauma to the head ,
massive internal hemorrhaging ,
multiple bone fractures .
she was a victim at the corn maze .
where is she ?
probably freshman lit .
i don &apos;t get it .
neither do i.
see , the patient was never admitted ,
even with such extensive injuries .
liam said you treated her at the scene .
that &apos;s a pretty good save for someone
with half a semester of pre @-@ med .
yeah . i think they were exaggerating
how bad off she was .
it was dark , and , yeah , there was a lot of blood .
don &apos;t . i know what alaric is .
i know what you are .
if any more blood bags go missing ,
i know who to come to .
somebody was thorough .
no pictures of damon anywhere .
it &apos;s kind of creepy , you just standing there all hulky and brooding .
says the freak who &apos;s stalking my sister .
technically , i &apos;m lying in wait .
why didn &apos;t bonnie come back ?
why didn &apos;t she come back ?
because she wasn &apos;t there .
it was just me .
you know i paid her cell bill
so i could call her phone and hear her say
the same 6 words every day ?
sounds good . i &apos;ll give it a call .
why ? she hated you .
bonnie wasn &apos;t there with me , jeremy ,
because she found peace .
she &apos;s in a better place .
how did you know ?
besides not believing that you closed
a penetrating abdominal trauma
without so much as a first aid kit ?
pretty sure you weren &apos;t looking for stevia in my coffee .
with alaric , i wasn &apos;t 100 % certain
he tried to compel me ,
but then i remembered i have really crappy luck in my love life .
so of course my hot , new teacher crush would be a vampire .
so then what are you ?
busy .
if you want to stick around , there &apos;s food trays
on the third floor that need clearing .
that &apos;s it ? you &apos;re gonna let me stay ?
you saved that girl
instead of feeding on her .
that &apos;s good enough for me .
you &apos;re not even afraid ,
not ever fazed , for that matter .
there &apos;s only one thing that can resist compulsion
without needing vervain , and that &apos;s a witch .
you &apos;re a witch .
how about i make a deal with you ?
you don &apos;t ask questions about me ,
and i won &apos;t ask questions about you .
deal .
oh , and you can tell alaric ,
if he wants to avoid a complicated relationship ,
he doesn &apos;t have to hide behind compulsion to do it .
maybe it was a good thing i didn &apos;t grow up here .
so where do you come from ?
give me the year , and i &apos;ll give you the town and foster home .
oh , good .
wonder what &apos;s in here .
it &apos;s locked .
locked means important .
hey , care , did you get him ?
no . enzo is not here .
any idea where tripp might have taken him
besides the very obvious one ?
hang on . let me see that .
caroline , we have another problem .
tripp ... has ivy &apos;s phone .
and ? i mean , the guy is a murderer .
petty theft isn &apos;t much of a stretch .
yeah , but your name is at the top
of the recent dialed list .
oh , my god , he knows what i am .
i &apos;m guessing he knows where to find you .
it &apos;s bonnie . leave me a message .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s your outgoing message ? really ?
i mean , the one time i &apos;m actively seeking
the sound of your voice , that &apos;s all i get .
perfect .
anyway , i &apos;m in your room ,
which is a lot less weird than it sounds .
i just wanted to say that
because of what you did for me ,
today is the day that i get to see elena .
so thank you ,
and i &apos;m sorry .
other than that , i don &apos;t know what to say
or what i &apos;m supposed to say except that ,
defying all possible global scenarios ,
i might miss you a little bit .
hey , i got to go .
so you didn &apos;t forget my number .
that &apos;s a good start .
yeah . i figured i &apos;d press the damon button
and see what happened .
and what is happening ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m doing .
i just--
i &apos;m thinking we should meet face to face .
i can &apos;t run from you forever .
so come by my dorm ?
yeah . yeah . i &apos;ll be here . there .
i &apos;ll be there , absolutely , in a bit .
see you in a little bit .
ok .
well , that was fast .
who are you ?
damon ?
elena , calm down .
just find caroline and get to old miller road .
we &apos;ll get him back .
i had an interesting conversation with elena .
yeah , and i want to hear all about it ,
just not right now .
what &apos;s the rush , occult studies emergency ?
yeah . i have someplace i need to be .
so if you don &apos;t mind--
why don &apos;t you just compel me out of the way ?
look . don &apos;t you think it &apos;s about time we level with each other ?
ok . how &apos;s this ?
my best friend , he just came back from the dead ,
but now i have to save him from a vampire hunter
before he &apos;s driven across an antimagic border and killed again .
so here &apos;s some friendly advice .
it &apos;s probably a good idea to stay as far away from me as possible .
morning , sunshine .
enzo ?
well , this brings back memories .
i &apos;m glad you found a way back , mate .
afraid it &apos;s gonna be a short reunion , through .
we &apos;re headed to mystic falls ,
known for its bridges ;
quaint , small @-@ town charm ;
and a really big vampire bug zapper .
stefan could &apos;ve told me there was a hunter in town .
it probably slipped his mind
because he &apos;s responsible for my return to incarceration .
why would he do that ?
probably jealous of my accent .
eh , maybe he did it because i killed his new girlfriend .
yeah . that &apos;ll do it .
sorry , mom .
elena is auditioning for &quot; top gear . &quot;
yeah . ok .
bye .
so my mom is shutting down route 13 .
tripp will have to double back ,
and there &apos;s only two other ways across the border .
do you have a tire preference -- front , back ?
no ? ok .
i think this sells a spinout .
what do you think ? elena ?
i want my memories back .
wait . what ?
i made up my mind .
if damon survives this ,
then i want alaric to uncompel me .
i mean , i can &apos;t imagine ever loving him .
i also can &apos;t
ignore the parts i don &apos;t like just to avoid the truth .
i mean , how would i make any decisions
if i only know half the story ?
you don &apos;t have to take apart the whole engine .
we just need to lure tripp in so we can grab them .
you know , it &apos;s not your fault .
pretty much is .
look . you &apos;re not the only one who gave up .
every second for the last 4 months ,
all i could think about was when i &apos;m gonna get my next sip of blood ,
when am i gonna screw up and hurt somebody ,
why did i come back to life just to be this thing ,
that i used to hunt vampires
and suddenly , i was one .
searching for damon was the only thing
that could take my mind off of it ,
but i was basically going through the motions
as a distraction because , honestly , stefan ,
i &apos;d given up , too .
there .
that &apos;s him . you should stay in the car .
he knows what you look like .
he thinks i &apos;m on his side .
yeah , unless enzo told him different .
go tell elena he &apos;s here .
evening .
tried to get my buddy to a bachelor party ,
and our car just stopped .
you think you can help us out ?
uh , don &apos;t know anything about cars .
yeah .
well , maybe you could give us a ride , then .
who &apos;s that ?
ric . he &apos;s up to something .
better be good . bastard owes me .
sorry . in a bit of a hurry .
yeah . so are we .
stefan .
stefan , what &apos;s happening ?
damon and alaric are across the border .
i got to go .
oh , my god .
i came back for this ?
consumption wasn &apos;t much fun the first time around , either .
it &apos;s ok . i &apos;m here .
how ?
followed you like a crazy stalker ,
not one of my finer moments .
no , no . get him .
you have to get me across the border .
it &apos;s stripping away the magic . i &apos;ll die .
you &apos;ll die if i move you .
i have to stop the bleeding .
nicked your descending aorta .
i know . that &apos;s what killed me .
you didn &apos;t have me back then , did you ,
and you didn &apos;t have hemostatic gauze .
get up . come on . get up .
what &apos;s happening ?
you still with me ?
while i &apos;m sealing this wound ,
i want you to think about how you tried
to compel one of the smartest women on campus
to forget about her date with you ,
the date where i single @-@ handedly
saved dozens of lives without smearing my makeup .
alaric ? hang on .
stay with me .
come on . gonna get that heart pumping .
you don &apos;t get to have the last word with me .
alaric !
alaric !
stay with me .
come on .
so-- so-- something is wrong .
don &apos;t move .
no .
something is wrong .
i &apos;m not supposed to be alive .
there &apos;s no reason you shouldn &apos;t be .
i sealed the wound .
we just have to get you to the hospital .
yeah . i &apos;ll tell her .
thanks .
i was just at route 9,
and there was a crash , but they weren &apos;t there .
yeah . i know . they had to get out of there .
what happened ?
stefan said that--
what , caroline ? what ?
alaric crossed the border ,
but jo was there , and she saved him .
so he &apos;s ok .
that means he &apos;s ok , right ?
yeah , elena . he &apos;s ok .
then why do you have that look on your face ?
what happened , caroline ?
all the magic stripped away ,
but jo saved him just before he died .
what ?
i don &apos;t know what that means , caroline .
alaric is not a vampire anymore , elena .
he &apos;s human .
thanks for the ride .
yeah .
i thought i &apos;d save you the trouble of having to boost another car .
that was almost funny .
hope for you yet , donovan .
if i told you i knew about your family ,
promise to take a little friendly advice ?
hang on .
you know who my family is ?
read any history book about the town &apos;s founding members .
the guys that live in this house
are damon and stefan salvatore .
why are you just telling me this now ?
because ...
they &apos;re vampires , and wherever they go ,
death and pain always follow .
so if you &apos;re looking for family ,
you &apos;re not gonna find it here .
do yourself a favor and get as far away from this place as you can .
come on !
no . damn it !
jer--
i keep trying to cancel bonnie &apos;s phone ,
but i can &apos;t without her pin .
why can &apos;t i remember her pin ?
get off ! get off !
hey , it &apos;s ok .
no , it &apos;s not !
she &apos;s gone .
bonnie is gone .
jo is a keeper . how does it feel ?
oh , it hurts a lot .
well , it &apos;s too bad there aren &apos;t any vampires in mystic falls
to help heal you .
well , i think they got me on a morphine drip .
it &apos;s the next best thing .
elena , i &apos;m so sorry .
no . no , alaric .
i &apos;m just glad that you &apos;re ok .
i mean , up until an hour ago ,
i didn &apos;t even want my memories to return .
i was the one who made the choice to lose them .
now i have to live with the fact
that you can &apos;t give them back to me .
i know how much you hated being a vampire .
so i &apos;m just glad one of us got what we wanted .
and what is it that you want ?
to be able to look damon in the eye ,
knowing all that i know
and all that i don &apos;t ,
and ...
see how i feel about him .
i want to trust how i feel .
i hope that you can .
good luck , ok ?
this hospital sucks .
i can &apos;t believe anyone actually makes it out alive .
they usually don &apos;t .
i &apos;m having you transferred to whitmore asap .
thank you .
just doing my job .
you did more than that .
you gave me back my life .
thank you .
i was this close , this close .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
oh , i got it . everybody is sorry .
you &apos;re sorry you gave up on me ,
sorry you turned enzo in to that hunter guy .
ric is sorry for the compulsion .
i &apos;m sure if elena could remember anything ,
she &apos;d be sorry , too .
you got to understand how hard it was for her .
i am so tired of hearing about how hard it was for her .
it was hard for me , as well .
at least you knew you had a home to come back to .
she didn &apos;t have anything .
to her , you were just gone .
guess i still am .
ric said she &apos;s happy without me since she &apos;s erased me .
you know what ? i don &apos;t want her to be happy .
i want her to be miserable just like i am .
you done ?
yeah . i &apos;m done .
good .
now quit stalling .
there &apos;s a girl you need to go see .
what if it doesn &apos;t work ?
what if what we had isn &apos;t strong enough
to break the compulsion ?
you &apos;re not gonna find out just sitting there , are you ?
here goes everything .
so ...
am i your last stop on the stefan salvatore apology tour ?
could we just get past this , please ?
i &apos;m trying to .
look , caroline .
what do you want me to do , huh ?
stop making me guess and tell me
so we can go back to being friends again .
yeah . well , that &apos;s the thing , stefan .
after all of this , i--
i don &apos;t want to be friends anymore .
