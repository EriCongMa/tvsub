gossip girl here ,
your one and only source
into the sandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
bart &apos;s been in an accident .
my father turned his first profit by the time he was 22 .
i hope to do it by the time i &apos;m 21 .
oh , you &apos;re in love with her .
it &apos;s all over your face .
no .
blair told me you were responsible for sabotaging me at cotillion .
tripp is divorcing maureen . we &apos;re going away together .
it is a huge mistake .
you wanna talk to me about mistakes ?
you don &apos;t get to judge me .
please don &apos;t get in the car .
serena , you coming ?
and who am i ?
that &apos;s a secret i &apos;ll never tell .
you know you love me .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
if you don &apos;t mind ...
i do .
serena , i can &apos;t stand this .
i love you .
tripp , everything is ruined , already
it &apos;s too late .
serena , it doesn &apos;t have to be ,
tripp !
they say that there are no accidents .
sometimes , reality comes crashing into us .
other times , it dawns on us slowly ,
despite our best efforts to ignore it .
morning . i brought your favorite .
oh , you &apos;re up .
i haven &apos;t been sleeping well .
i know , hence the breakfast in bed ...
which will taste just as good in the living room .
i &apos;m not hungry .
stop trying to pretend , chuck . i know why you &apos;re upset .
today is a day like any other .
in fact , i &apos;m going to a meeting .
i &apos;m looking at a property on the lower east side .
i can &apos;t be resting on my laurels .
the empire &apos;s doing well .
it &apos;s time to look ahead .
well , since i canceled my day ,
i am now completely free , so i &apos;m coming with you .
hey . i thought you were getting
ready for that co @-@ op meeting .
oh . right .
it slipped my mind .
you cleaning out the closet again ?
i thought you did that yesterday and the day before .
well , vanya has organized a clothing drive--
&quot; coats for kiev . &quot;
vanya &apos;s from minsk .
lil , none of this is making much sense .
does this have something to do with serena ?
what , other than the fact that she won &apos;t speak to me ?
that she &apos;s holed up with some married politician ,
acting like some sort of teenage rielle hunter ?
well , if it &apos;s this upsetting , let &apos;s do something about it .
where is she ? let &apos;s bring her back .
would you represent us at the co @-@ op meeting today ?
it &apos;s about the rooftop garden .
you know how strict
those green people are about attendance .
if it &apos;ll help you out , i &apos;m totally free .
i had a feeling you might say that .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
nothing . i &apos;m sorry .
look , i know our family &apos;s going through a lot ,
and i love ... that you &apos;ve made us your priority .
it &apos;s at park avenue autumn .
no , no . of course , sir . i &apos;m thrilled .
i &apos;ll be in touch with an answer . thanks again .
you &apos;ve been ducking work all week .
who was important enough for you to finally take their call ?
barney frank .
really ?
he asked me to serve on the finance subcommittee .
oh ! that &apos;s so exciting .
hey , maybe--maybe this will all blow over .
unfortunately , it has to blow up before it blows over .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before maureen goes public .
and i can &apos;t hide out here forever .
well , if being together means everything will fall apart ,
then so be it .
it &apos;ll be hard , but we &apos;ll figure it out ,
even if that means starting over .
right .
starting over .
hey .
we &apos;ll get through this .
i &apos;m gonna go into town and get some supplies .
no . don &apos;t be too long .
um , this building is a homeless shelter .
&quot; a , &quot; gross , and &quot; b , &quot; really ?
i &apos;m not a huge advocate of the downtrodden ,
but i am a fan of not stepping
on them when i &apos;m at john derian .
if you turn these into lofts ,
then where are they going to live ?
i don &apos;t know , blair . one step at a time .
the owner of the building &apos;s waiting inside with the specs .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
far be it from me to be overcome with the holiday spirit ,
but this whole scrooge act ?
you should be at home today
or laying flowers on your father &apos;s grave .
i know today is the anniversary of his death .
why don &apos;t you take the car
and meet me at the hotel later for lunch ?
we &apos;ll have our quiet time then .
fine .
pretend like you never get sad
and all you care about is making more money .
but just so we &apos;re clear , i know better .
and you , chuck bass , are not your father .
i know .
we make our own fortunes ,
and then call them fate .
hey .
can you meet me right now ?
i think we should talk .
and what better excuse to choose a path
than to insist it &apos;s our destiny ?
but at the end of the day ,
we all have to live with our choices ...
you did the right thing , son .
no matter who &apos;s looking over our shoulder .
spotted--an &quot; it &quot; girl with an &quot; it &quot; bag .
looks like the roadie to success is paved with cruel intentions .
can i hold the baby ?
oh , it &apos;s beautiful !
i &apos;ve never seen one in the flesh .
because it &apos;s not in stores yet .
even the waiting list is still waiting .
i guess it pays to be lily bass &apos; daughter .
well , her name is &quot; humphrey &quot; now ,
and i got this through my own connections .
o.m.g. ! twins !
you have the same bag !
how did you get that ? !
well , great minds shop alike .
although in the future , j , we should probably coordinate .
i &apos;ll take tuesdays and thursdays and alternate wednesdays ?
how about you take yours back to the store ?
you know i have first dibs on designer everything .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry , jenny .
but my mom brought this back for me from paris .
it had its own seat on the plane . well ,
since you apparently love your new bag
more than your old friends , i guess you can carry it ...
across the street .
enjoy being b.f.f.s with a hunk of leather .
so who wants to hold it first ?
okay , that was totally humiliating .
that was kind of the point .
if we wanna turn carmen and jane against jenny ,
we &apos;ve gotta make them see that
she is the meanest queen ever .
consider the mission a success .
i had to pinch myself to keep from crying .
i know it &apos;s hard , but you have to stick with the plan .
and if the plan doesn &apos;t work ?
if it does work ,
we &apos;ll make sure you end up the new queen .
you better . but in the mean time ...
i &apos;m keepin &apos; the bag .
are you ready for phase two ?
olivia called it , you know .
i mean , and i was--i was too stupid or too stubborn
to realize that she was right about vanessa .
and now my window &apos;s closed .
she &apos;s all off into
this paul hoffman guy .
dan , do you really think
if you went toe @-@ to @-@ toe with paul hoffman
that you couldn &apos;t take him down ?
you &apos;re using him as an excuse .
no , no , he &apos;s a .. he &apos;s a .. he &apos;s a handsome guy , a sophomore .
he and vanessa have a lot in common .
he &apos;s a douche . listen , you have two options here--
you can man up , go to war and fight for the girl you love ,
or just forget her and move on to a palate cleanser .
so you &apos;re saying my only choices are
extreme emotional vulnerability with a good friend ,
or meaningless sex with a stranger ?
yeah , pretty much .
all right .
hi . we were just talking about you . oh .
uh , we &apos;re going up to my country house this weekend ,
and i wondered if you wanted to come .
and there &apos;s a hot tub .
it &apos;s kind of a writers retreat . and paul &apos;s coming .
oh ... you know , that sounds-- that sounds so tempting .
but i think , um , i got a lot of homework
so i think i &apos;m gonna stick around here .
oh . okay . i &apos;ll call you when we get back .
okay . see ya .
dude , what was that ? you should totally go .
you can box paul out of the hot tub
or get with willa .
willa ?
oh , yeah , she &apos;s so cute . look at her .
and she &apos;s a drama major . actresses are crazy .
willa !
yeah ?
yeah , you know what ?
um ... on second thought , i &apos;d love to go .
it sounds like fun .
really ?
yeah .
great .
we &apos;re meeting at the dorms tonight . come find me .
will do .
you &apos;re welcome .
looks like i won .
hi , i &apos;m rufus humphrey , lily &apos;s--
husband . hi . holland kemble .
we &apos;d been placing bets on when
you &apos;d show up , and i had today .
oh , why ? did bart used to come to these meetings ?
nope . not once .
but an attractive man like yourself
moves into the building ... based on your comings and goings ,
it doesn &apos;t seem like you have a boardroom to run
or a hedge fund to manage ,
so we figured it was just a matter of time .
i @-@ i @-@ i think you have the wrong idea .
i &apos;m not some sort of trophy husband .
my family &apos;s just in transition .
it &apos;s okay . we all sacrifice our independence for love .
at first it seems totally worth it .
it &apos;s just later after you &apos;ve given everything up
that you realize you have nothing left to offer .
that &apos;s when your husband starts banging his yoga teacher .
sorry .
that was probably an overshare .
ladies and gentleman ,
let &apos;s begin .
you said you were getting groceries .
where are you ?
i &apos;m with my grandfather , actually .
he got wind of what was going down and called .
honestly , i &apos;m relieved to get his advice .
well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re working things out ,
but you left me alone .
and there &apos;s no coffee or cable .
and i came here to be with you .
i know , and i so appreciate you being patient .
you &apos;re there for me 100 % , and i &apos;m the one who &apos;s a mess .
true .
but your life is pretty complicated ,
and i knew what i was getting myself into .
thank you for understanding .
i &apos;ll see you tonight .
wait , tonight ?
deep breath , tripp .
if we handle this right , you &apos;ll be able to keep
the career you worked so hard for
and get the woman of your dreams ,
and i &apos;ll still have my marriage .
why are you okay with this ?
we both share
a dream we &apos;re not willing to give up on .
i was hoping you &apos;d come to your senses , and now you have .
i do care about my career ,
but not as much as i care about serena .
i just wanna make sure i &apos;m being clear about that .
it &apos;s my personal opinion that serena is just a phase .
a few years from now ,
we &apos;ll look back and all this will be a faded memory .
well , that &apos;s where our opinions diverge .
i &apos;m willing to take that chance .
i guess now we see if serena &apos;s willing to bet against you .
i &apos;m thinking a personal appeal , woman @-@ to @-@ woman .
i liked what i saw today .
seems like the right property at the right time .
you have the cash .
you should &apos;ve signed at the site ,
be moving forward by now .
there &apos;s just a few things i need to figure out first .
like the building &apos;s residents ?
they &apos;re not your concern .
and if you want the write @-@ off for &apos; 09,
you need to be breaking ground by the new year , so ...
ho ho homeless .
no disrespect ,
but i don &apos;t need your advice .
i &apos;ve been doing pretty well without you .
oh , yeah .
the empire .
nice hotel .
thank you .
but to be honest ,
i haven &apos;t seen anything in the last year
that suggest you have what it takes .
if anything .
you &apos;ve been a disappointment .
you opened your heart to blair ,
and it made you weak .
you cannot be
one person at work and another one at home .
if you &apos;re soft , you &apos;re soft .
and well , let &apos;s face it--
you &apos;re soft .
&quot; i love you , too . &quot;
hey , i &apos;m sorry to call .
i know you probably don &apos;t wanna
hear from me after thanksgiving .
no . no , of course i do .
i &apos;ve been thinking about you .
just worried .
is everything okay ? where &apos;s tripp ?
he &apos;s out . i &apos;m at the cottage , and the heat died .
i know you &apos;ve been here before .
so do you know how to restart it ?
you know , i &apos;ve actually , um ,
only been there over the summer .
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know how to help you .
okay , heat is optional ,
but please tell me there &apos;s a microwave or wi @-@ fi .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m starved and bored out of my mind .
ever read &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; ?
i prefer fitzgerald to hemingway .
yeah , i &apos;ve never read it either ,
but go look for it on the bookshelf .
it &apos;s blue with a yellow bookmark .
oh ! and the location of your secret boyhood pot stash .
just don &apos;t tell grandfather .
tripp and i hid it there a couple of summers ago ,
so it might be a little dusty ,
but it &apos;s the best i can do
till tripp gets back .
where is he , anyway ?
actually , he &apos;s with your grandfather
getting advice on the difficult days ahead . nate ?
yeah , just , um ... listen , stay warm ,
and if you need anything else , just give me a buzz .
like a lighter ?
hey , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m really glad we can still talk .
yeah , me , too .
bye .
hello , serena .
maureen . you have no reason to be here .
get out or i &apos;ll call tripp .
who do you think told me you were here ?
tripp and i aren &apos;t getting divorced .
you can have him in private ,
but i get him in public .
he keeps his career , i keep my pride and position ,
and you get ...
whatever you &apos;re getting .
screwed , i think they call it .
y @-@ you &apos;re asking me to be your husband &apos;s mistress ?
it &apos;s a time @-@ honored political tradition .
i &apos;m jackie . you &apos;re marilyn .
i love tripp , and i &apos;d do anything to make him happy .
what makes him happy is being with me .
i know tripp would never send you here .
he knows that i wouldn &apos;t agree with this .
he was skeptical , it &apos;s true .
but he didn &apos;t know that i have this .
where &apos;d you get that ?
the more relevant question is what your stepfather will say
when he finds out your mother is a cheating whore .
your mother and father alone in his hotel room ...
what do you think they were doing ?
i don &apos;t know . the letter doesn &apos;t say .
knowing lily , i think we can assume the worst .
i &apos;m pretty sure rufus will .
okay , then .
you think about my offer .
honestly , with this letter ,
i could &apos;ve forced you out of the picture altogether .
but it &apos;s not what tripp wants , so i &apos;m being pragmatic .
i hope you &apos;ll decide to do the same .
i thought you were meeting me for lunch .
i had too much to drink .
oh . well ...
we &apos;ll just order room service .
look , i really don &apos;t need you to take care of me .
i know ...
how hard it was for you to let your guard down
to let me in .
but you &apos;ve changed .
i &apos;m buying that building .
chuck ...
don &apos;t tell me what to do .
i &apos;m not .
just talk to me .
blair ...
i need you to get out of here now .
chuck .
now .
maybe there &apos;s hope for you yet .
you know , jenny said that if she was chosen to be queen ,
then things would be better ,
but if you think about it , things are actually kinda worse .
blair never banished a girl for getting a gift .
it is almost christmas .
right . there could be wish list carnage .
think about it .
did someone mention christmas ? happy holidays , ladies .
see , that &apos;s why i was so mad at sawyer ,
cause she ruined the surprise .
it &apos;s y.s.l. for everyone .
o.m.g.b.g.e. !
oh , my god ! best gift ever ! i love you !
i love you , too !
jenny , where did you even get the money ?
my mom &apos;s generous , but she wouldn &apos;t give you
the price of a smart car to spend on purses .
come on , ladies . let &apos;s go buy matching lipstick .
chuck &apos;s having such a difficult day ,
and since i &apos;m sure you are , too ,
i thought you might have some words of advice .
cyrus says it &apos;s an essential
part of life , honoring the dead .
but chuck refuses to visit bart &apos;s grave even today .
on the anniversary of his death .
do you know that chuck &apos;s never been to his mother &apos;s grave once ?
i can understand not going on the date she died ...
it is his birthday after all ...
but bart refused to tell him where evelyn was even buried ,
said it was morbid for a child to visit a cemetery .
lily ? mm .
are you listening ?
yes , of course i am , blair .
and i will go see charles and talk to him .
thank you .
hello , mr. humphrey .
blair . what brings you here ?
i was just looking for backup from lily .
bart &apos;s 1 @-@ year mark .
oh . lil , why didn &apos;t you say something ?
no wonder you &apos;re so upset today .
bart &apos;s death was such a tough time .
thank you for standing by me . mm .
i don &apos;t know what i would ever do if i lost you .
well , i &apos;m not going anywhere .
it &apos;s not that i believe maureen ,
but tripp hasn &apos;t returned any of my texts or messages ,
and i need to talk to him .
i think that you should be open
to the idea that at least some of what maureen was saying
might be true .
why would you say that ?
i &apos;ve risked everything to be with tripp .
i have to have faith . your grandfather just loves to talk .
tripp will be home soon , and he &apos;ll explain everything .
serena , my grandfather &apos;s in bermuda .
what ? when we got off the phone earlier ,
i called my mom , just to be sure .
i don &apos;t know where tripp is , but he &apos;s lying
to you .
will you excuse me ? i have to go .
look likes the love nest has become a hornet &apos;s nest ...
sir , how long till we get to nassau county ?
and here comes nate to stir it up .
come in .
i , um , i &apos;m ready to go . so i don &apos;t know if you got a car
or we &apos;re taking the train or what .
i told paul and vanessa we &apos;d be a while .
i &apos;d like your thoughts on something
while we &apos;re still alone .
uh , yeah . yeah , sure . what is it ?
it &apos;s a performance art piece i did .
it &apos;s kind of karen finley meets
daryl hannah in &quot; legal eagles , &quot;
but without ...
clothing .
you &apos;re , uh ...
you &apos;re naked there .
hello , charles .
how are you ?
busy . i told the front desk not to bother sending you up .
i &apos;m on my way out .
well , wherever you &apos;re going ,
will you put it off for a few hours
and come with me to the cemetery ?
i can &apos;t . it &apos;s business .
well , we both know that your father was a complicated man .
and i honestly think that he thought
it was just easier to be alone . and you know what ?
there are moments that i think i agree with him .
but we &apos;re not that way , i &apos;m afraid . we need each other .
and right now , i need you
to do this with me .
i &apos;m sorry , lily ,
but i believe
the way to honor my father is to work .
sometimes we need to do something
to show people how we feel ,
even when they &apos;re not here to see it .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s serena .
excuse me .
mom , it &apos;s me .
serena , are you okay ? you sound upset .
i &apos;ll be fine , eventually .
i know how mad you are that i chose to go with tripp
rather than following your advice .
well , i
never wanted to punish you , just protect you .
you don &apos;t need to explain .
right now ... i just need my mom . okay ?
of course , darling .
maureen has my letter from dad .
what ?
i don &apos;t know how she got it ,
but she doesn &apos;t want to leave tripp ,
and she &apos;s threatening to show it to rufus .
oh , my god .
what does tripp say ?
i don &apos;t know , because i can &apos;t get in touch with him .
and it doesn &apos;t matter anyway ,
because i know he &apos;s lying to me .
oh , serena , i &apos;m so sorry for that letter
and what happened with your father .
i &apos;ll tell rufus everything ,
which i should have done already .
look , just get home ,
and we &apos;ll fix everything , okay ? i promise .
thank you , mom . i love you .
i love you , too .
so much for the day of the dead .
yes , i &apos;m afraid i have to attend to the living right now .
look , i hope you &apos;ll consider what i said ,
maybe do this for both of us .
they should be yellow roses . they were my mother &apos;s favorite .
serena , where are you going ?
away from you , liar . i &apos;ll find a cab .
serena , wait .
tell me it isn &apos;t true .
tell me that you &apos;re getting a divorce ,
that you spent the entire day talking to your grandfather
and that you didn &apos;t send maureen here ,
and nate is just jealous .
i can &apos;t even look at you .
serena , let me at least drive you .
i &apos;ll take you back to the city . we can talk in the car .
you know ... i want to be with you more than anything .
please .
let me explain .
i &apos;ll get in the car , but no talking .
i &apos;m done talking .
tripp !
maureen ?
something terrible &apos;s happened .
i need help .
oh my god
serena !
what happened ?
where &apos;s tripp ?
tripp ?
is he okay ?
no , serena , tripp &apos;s not here .
he was driving .
this is tripp . leave a message .
tripp ?
i need to see you right now .
you meet me at the hospital or i &apos;m going to the cops .
what is that heavenly smell ?
i am christening the kitchen with a little bolognese .
i figured you could use some comfort food today .
are the kids home yet ?
not yet .
well , since we have a little alone time ,
there &apos;s something i want to tell you .
sounds serious .
it is .
oh , god . it &apos;s 5 @-@ 1 @-@ 6 . it might be serena .
hello ?
mm . mm . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m s .. i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s 100 % me . it &apos;s not you , you know .
um , and your ... this performance thing is amazing .
you &apos;re .. you &apos;re a @-@ a great kisser .
uh , i just .. oh .
you know what ? i gotta ... i gotta take this . i &apos;m sorry .
serena &apos;s been in a car accident .
what ?
yeah . i @-@ i don &apos;t know much , but we gotta go .
what happened ?
wait . where are you going ?
i &apos;ll explain on the way . come on .
what ?
what now , blair ?
i &apos;ll see you there .
arthur , change of destination . we &apos;re going to nassau county .
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re almost there .
everyone &apos;s waiting .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re gonna have a backup offer lined up .
would you just leave me alone ? !
you get to the l.i.e.
stop looking at me .
what were you thinking , tripp ?
have you seen her ? is serena okay ?
you left her alone in a wrecked car
and you moved her ?
what happened to you , man ? you know , you were--
you were the good guy . you were the honest one .
nate , you &apos;ve gotta understand--
oh , i fully understand .
i called 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
oh , come on . are you serious ?
look , i know we &apos;re family ,
but what you did is unforgivable .
when the cops start asking questions ,
i &apos;m telling them the truth .
the truth is that tripp was with me .
i told you to stay in the car .
i think the days of you telling me what to do
are behind us , don &apos;t you ?
i &apos;ve spoken to william .
he &apos;s got tripp &apos;s back on this one .
if anyone starts asking questions ,
i &apos;m ready with a statement
that says tripp was with me all night .
what about serena &apos;s statement ?
with her history of drinking and drugs ,
not to mention her unstable family background
and the many , many men ...
in any case , your grandfather is very well liked
by the sheriff &apos;s department around here .
coming , tripp ?
i &apos;d love to see her . you don &apos;t think you could help me get ...
spotted-- the fall of a politician ...
you stay the hell away from her .
and the rise of a hero .
poor congressman . you &apos;ve been vetoed .
i am so sorry .
i guess i had to learn the hard way .
well , like mother , like daughter .
is rufus here ?
well , um , he &apos;s coming ,
but i asked him to look for your health insurance papers .
they &apos;re somewhere in my desk .
mom , my insurance card is in my wallet .
you didn &apos;t tell him , did you ?
well , i was going to ,
and then the hospital called .
and , um , with maureen and who knows what else ,
i didn &apos;t know what we &apos;d be walking into here .
i @-@ i just need to rest now .
please .
okay .
hi .
hi .
nice outfit .
you , too .
you were so right about this one .
what are you doing out here ?
come on .
i &apos;m sorry , mrs. bass .
charles , the doctors say there &apos;s nothing more they can do .
we have to let him go .
chuck , stay .
be here with us .
how &apos;s serena ?
she &apos;s gonna be okay .
lily &apos;s here ?
eric &apos;s here ?
everyone &apos;s here .
chuck ?
my father always thought i was weak .
and in the moment that mattered most , i was .
i couldn &apos;t be there when he , uh ...
i left , ran away .
i &apos;ve been ...
pushing myself
to prove him wrong , and ...
been pushing you away .
i don &apos;t think you ran away
because you couldn &apos;t handle death .
i think it &apos;s because you couldn &apos;t handle feelings .
but you &apos;re not like that anymore .
you &apos;re strong .
you carry people .
you carry me .
you &apos;re becoming a man in a way that ...
your father never was .
come .
let &apos;s say good @-@ bye .
thank you .
you want a sip of my coffee ?
no , thanks .
i was just offering .
just declining the offer .
eric , i &apos;m sorry .
jenny , can we stop this ?
so i &apos;m assuming you set sawyer up with that bag .
me and kira , yeah .
i heard you talking to that shopgirl on the phone .
i knew you were listening to that call .
which is why you were ready with the bags for jane and carmen .
you are starting to scare me .
right back at ya . and i wouldn &apos;t have had to do it
if it wasn &apos;t for your smear campaign .
which you totally deserved .
hey , truce ?
yeah . come on . let &apos;s go buy serena
one of those hideous stuffed bears at the gift shop
with the &quot; get well soon &quot; balloon .
maureen , hi .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m actually on my way out .
i know you must be surprised to see me ,
but if you have a moment ...
i &apos;ve been having some difficulties in my marriage ,
and i &apos;d hate to see anyone
suffer through the same pain that i have .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
somehow this ended up in my coat pocket at thanksgiving .
just read it .
i mean , imagine if serena would have hit her head
a little harder or the car rolled or the--
vanessa ...
i love you .
i love you , too .
dan .
that was not the reaction i was hoping for .
dan , sometimes when people are under a lot of emotional stress ,
they say things that they don &apos;t really mean .
yeah , i was , uh , i @-@ i @-@ i think i @-@ i read that somewhere .
i &apos;m gonna go see if serena needs anything .
rufus ?
sinatra sings ,
&quot; new york , new york , it &apos;s a helluva town . &quot;
but on the upper east side ,
sometimes it just feels like hell .
i think i might need some advice .
even when we &apos;re sure we &apos;ve earned that happy ending ...
it doesn &apos;t always come .
second thoughts creep in .
secret missions sneak out .
and only sleeping beauty finds her prince .
hey , you &apos;re late .
these guys are texting . they &apos;re waiting .
sorry . it was a hectic night .
do you even have it on you ?
well , can i hold it ?
the queen bee likes a thrill , yeah ?
and , uh , this time , i want to go to the table alone .
by the way , those handbags totally saved my ass ,
so , uh , thanks for making that happen .
don &apos;t thank me . you earned that money .
and i needed it .
it &apos;s not easy being queen . or cheap .
stick with me , jenny humphrey ,
and you &apos;ll have enough cash to underwrite your entire kingdom .
in this city , nothing is for certain .
the night can push you forward into a dark future
or plunge you into a mysterious past .
lily ?
