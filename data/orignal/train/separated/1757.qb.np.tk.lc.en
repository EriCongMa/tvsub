so , tell me about your day--
how &apos;s it going with the particle detector ?
wow ! you remember that ?
yeah , i listen to what you say .
you &apos;re building a particle detector
using superfluid helium .
you know , when you talk like that ,
i want to take you right here on this table .
and you know from past experience
this table cannot support both our weight .
so , how &apos;s the detector going ?
well , it &apos;s tricky working with superfluids .
whatever container you put them in ,
they kind of creep up the sides
and crawl out all on their own .
kind of like sheldon &apos;s ant farm .
exactly , except you don &apos;t have a lunatic running around ,
yelling , &quot; i fed you sugar water , why are you biting me ? &quot;
come on , this is boring-- you really want to talk about this ?
no , i do .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t write &quot; superfluid helium &quot;
on this napkin for nothing .
okay , well ...
this is cool .
uh , there &apos;s a thing called &quot; superfluid vacuum theory , &quot;
where empty space is imagined as a superfluid
with all of its qualities--
viscosity , density , surface tension ...
hey , if you &apos;re pausing for dramatic effect ,
i &apos;d keep it moving .
no , no .
people don &apos;t talk about surface tension .
if you imagine our three @-@ space as the surface
of an n @-@ dimensional superfluid bubble ...
this ... is exciting .
this is really exciting .
i have to go find sheldon .
okay , well , if you find him ,
use the kitchen island--
that coffee table will not support both of you .
which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid
shows the same negative @-@ energy density as space @-@ time .
so what do you think ? what do you think ? so what do you think ?
what ? is it wrong ?
have you seen it somewhere else ?
i know this isn &apos;t my area ,
and i could never do the math like you can ,
but could this be something ... ?
well ...
you could have set newton &apos;s gravitational constant to one .
and , ugh , the whole thing reeks of blueberry .
you know i can &apos;t stand these scented markers .
no one told you to taste them .
come on , is @-@ is this good or not ?
it &apos;s good .
really ?
i like it .
i think you &apos;re on to something .
you do ? you &apos;re not messing with me ?
not at all .
in fact , i have got something
for just such an occasion .
i was starting to think
i might never get a chance to give it to you .
good job .
you &apos;re giving me a sticker ?
indeed .
not just a sticker .
that is a sticker of a kitty saying , &quot; me @-@ wow ! &quot;
i &apos;m not a preschooler .
fine , i &apos;ll take it back .
i earned this ! back off !
you &apos;re still awake ?
for a man whose last observation was
our universe may be the surface
of a multidimensional supercooled liquid ,
&quot; you &apos;re still awake &quot; seems like quite the sophomore slump .
you worked out all the math .
oh , i did more than work out all the math .
i wrote a paper .
you wrote a paper on my idea ?
i wrote a paper on our idea .
when did my idea become our idea ?
when i mixed it with sheldony goodness
and cooked it in the easy @-@ bake oven of my mind .
this is good .
our idea is really good .
well , the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright .
you know , if no one &apos;s thought of this , yet ,
this could be a big deal .
only way we &apos;ll know for sure is
if we post it online to the pre @-@ print server .
i have it ready to go , but i wasn &apos;t gonna do it without you .
wow , it &apos;s all happening so fast .
should we just sleep on it ?
we could , but we always run the risk
of someone else beating us to the punch .
you &apos;re sure it &apos;s good ?
my name is right on there with yours .
that is a surefire mark of quality .
that might as well say &quot; directed by joss whedon . &quot;
okay , partner , let &apos;s do it .
come on .
click the mouse with me .
one ...
two ...
three ...
click .
well , we did it .
yes , we did , my friend .
is your tongue blue ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
okay , movie night-- what do you want to watch ?
whatever happened to that ape movie you were in ?
oh , god .
probably nothing .
i think i saw the director twirling a sign outside the verizon store .
search for it .
wha ... no . no ! why ?
&apos;cause it would be fun to watch .
it would be humiliating .
well , now we have two reasons .
they have it .
please , can we watch it ?
please ?
fine , but i &apos;m telling you-- it &apos;s terrible .
have you even seen it ?
no .
well , maybe it turned out better than you think .
bananas , get your fresh bananas .
it really didn &apos;t .
sheldon , this is superfluid helium .
put this in your mouth ,
your tongue will freeze and break off .
does it smell like blueberries ?
no .
then we &apos;re probably okay .
hey , your paper got mentioned
on the quantum diaries physics blog .
really ?
wh @-@ what &apos;d they say ?
uh , it &apos;s basically a summary of the theory ,
but there &apos;s a bunch of positive comments on the message board .
let me see , let me see .
one calls it &quot; insightful and innovative . &quot;
we &apos;re insightful and innovative .
ooh , nice to meet you , mr. insightful .
oh , the pleasure is mine , mr. innovative .
uh , another one says , &quot; the concept shows
some real out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ box thinking . &quot;
do you hear that , mr. out @-@ of @-@ the ?
i do , indeed , mr. box @-@ thinking .
how are you today ,
mr. can @-@ you @-@ believe- these @-@ jack @-@ asses ?
just dandy , mr ....
i @-@ wish @-@ i @-@ was- better @-@ at @-@ improv .
read another one . okay , okay . uh ...
&quot; the analogy between space @-@ time
and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or ... false . &quot;
&quot; i wish this blog would devote itself to real science
instead of wasting our time with crackpot ,
wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish . &quot;
who wrote that ?
it &apos;s anonymous ,
and user name &quot; general relativity . &quot;
well ... i &apos;m responding to it .
uh , don &apos;t lower yourself to their level .
look , i am simply going to defend our work ,
scientist to scientist .
and failing that ,
suggest that his mother enjoys a string
of both human and non @-@ human lovers .
sheldon , my name &apos;s on that paper , too .
there &apos;s no upside to doing this .
he just left another comment .
what does it say ?
&quot; upon review , i &apos;ve changed my mind about
the cooper @-@ hofstadter hypothesis
that space @-@ time is like a superfluid . in fact ,
it &apos;s inspired me to come up with my own theory .
maybe space @-@ time is like two clowns
with their heads in a bucket ,
much like cooper and hofstadter . &quot;
can i respond now ?
do it .
you mess with the bull , you get the horns .
i &apos;m about to show this guy just how horny i can be .
somebody else do it .
doctor , please help me .
i think i might be turning into a killer gorilla .
why do you think you &apos;re turning into a killer gorilla
and not just a regular gorilla ?
because regular gorillas are vegetarians ,
and i just bit the fingers off your receptionist !
okay , we &apos;ve seen plenty .
no ! give me the remote .
careful . she &apos;ll bite your fingers off .
okay , well , i &apos;ve been poking around the internet ,
and i think i found something we &apos;ll enjoy watching even more .
what is it ?
oh , just a video of bernadette in a beauty pageant .
what ? !
okay , i learned my lesson .
making fun of people is wrong !
i haven &apos;t learned my lesson .
play it ! play it !
hi . i &apos;m bernadette maryann rostenkowski
from yorba linda , california .
you look like a talking cupcake !
and you should pick me
for miss california quiznos 1999 , because i want to ...
tell you what i want , what i really really want
i &apos;ll tell you what i want , what i really really want
i wanna , i wanna , i wanna , i wanna
really , really , really be
miss california quiznos 1999 !
play it again ! play it again !
did he respond yet ?
hmm . no , not yet .
well ,
maybe we shouldn &apos;t have sunk to his level .
it wasn &apos;t that bad .
read it back one more time .
&quot; my good sir , we are neither crackpots nor wannabes .
in fact , we are experts in our fields .
and while you hide behind your anonymity ,
we stand behind our paper .
and later tonight , your mother . &quot;
and you don &apos;t think that &apos;s too rough ?
we &apos;re just standing behind her .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re gonna say &quot; boo &quot; and scare her .
how could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s embarrassing .
it is ; it truly is .
yeah , well ...
amy writes little house
on the prairie fan fiction
about herself and posts it on the internet .
no !
why ? what did i do ? !
sorry , i had to get the spotlight off me ,
and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training .
okay . we are reading that right now .
no , please don &apos;t .
we got embarrassed tonight . come on .
but it &apos;s personal .
why ? is it about you and sheldon ?
no .
oh , my god , it &apos;s about her and sheldon .
it &apos;s not about me and sheldon .
it &apos;s about a young woman in the 1800s named amelia ...
and the time @-@ traveling physicist named cooper
she falls in love with .
please show us ?
please ?
no .
you know i &apos;m gonna read it either way .
good luck finding it .
amelia and ...
the time @-@ trav ...
found it !
&quot; it was just past dawn on the prairie ,
and like every morning ,
amelia prepared to do her chores .
except something about this morning felt different . &quot;
why ?
why did it feel different ?
&quot; maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air ,
or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man
with porcelain skin and curious clothing
she was about to discover lying in the field .
a man who would open her mind to new possibilities
and her body to new feelings . &quot;
you know , there was a time when i was alone and had no friends .
i &apos;m starting to miss that .
he still hasn &apos;t responded .
what &apos;s taking him so long ?
do you really want him to write back ?
yeah , i do . no matter how he responds ,
i am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat
saying , &quot; oh , really ? &quot;
me @-@ wow .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;ve , uh , created some other user accounts
so i can post positive comments about their paper .
&quot; this wee li &apos;l bairn of a theory
nearly blew my kilt off &quot; ?
no . you have to read it how dr. angus mcdoogal
of the university of edinburgh would .
&quot; this wee li &apos;l bairn of a theory
nearly blew me kilt off . &quot;
he wrote back !
&quot; cooper and hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humor
is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper .
it should come as no surprise
given they work at cal tech , essentially a technical school ,
where even the physicists are basically engineers . &quot;
&quot; engineers &quot; !
do you know how insulting that is ?
yes .
guys , this person &apos;s just going out of their way
to get a rise out of you .
yeah , but it &apos;s still so aggravating .
yeah , well , all the other comments said really nice things .
focus on those .
yeah .
dr. dmitri plancovik of moscow university said ,
&quot; dis paper great .
i love it more than &apos; wodka .. &quot;
see ? better with the accent .
and ... send .
what did you write ?
i &apos;m done hiding from bullies .
i &apos;m taking this into the real world .
what does that mean ?
i told him we &apos;ll meet him face @-@ to @-@ face
anytime , anywhere .
are you crazy ? you don &apos;t know who this person is .
delete that !
come on , sheldon !
oh , okay , okay , calm down .
it &apos;s him !
he &apos;s trying to video chat .
perhaps i shouldn &apos;t have taken this into the real world .
oh , really ?
&quot; &apos; time travel ? i don &apos;t understand , &apos; &quot; said amelia .
cooper stared at her .
&apos;which rd don &apos;t you understand , time or travel ? &apos; &quot;
wow , even in your fantasies sheldon &apos;s kind of exhausting .
he &apos;s like that in the beginning ,
so she can change him .
it &apos;s called good writing .
and wishful thinking .
&quot; it stung amelia &quot;
when he spoke to her this way .
&quot; in her little one @-@ room schoolhouse ,
&quot; she was always the smartest student ,
&quot; regularly besting the boys in her class ,
&quot; but this was no boy in front of her--
&quot; this was a man .
here we go .
&quot; cooper told amelia
&quot; about all the strange and incredible things
&quot; the future would hold , like computers
&quot; and living past 30 .
&quot; he asked her if she had any questions .
&quot; all she longed to ask was
&quot; if his heart was beating as fast as hers ,
&quot; but she was too afraid to hear the answer . &quot;
oh , amelia .
&quot; so instead she asked if , in the future ,
montana ever became a state . &quot;
in the 1800s that was considered flirting .
i &apos;m so sick of people being mean on the internet .
well , i think the anonymity makes everyone feel like
they can say things they &apos;d never say to your face .
interesting .
i can &apos;t think of a single thing
i wouldn &apos;t say to someone &apos;s face .
never noticed that about you .
you know what ? a @-@ at least you guys did something .
you know , you @-@ you had a theory ,
you wrote a paper ,
you made an actual contribution .
all guys like this do is just stand on other people &apos;s work .
he &apos;s right .
i say we call this person back .
we &apos;ve got no reason to hide .
all right , do it . call him .
let &apos;s find out what this loser &apos;s ever accomplished .
click it with me .
one , two , three ...
click .
click .
well , hello there .
professor hawking ?
oh , brother , you should see the look on your faces .
you really didn &apos;t like our paper ?
i like your paper very much .
the premise is intriguing .
then why are you attacking us ?
if you were sitting in a chair for 40 years ,
you &apos;d get bored , too .
anyway ,
got to go .
i promised to help the neighbor kid with his math homework .
ciao .
stephen hawking liked our paper .
said the premise is intriguing .
good to see you again ,
mr. stephen @-@ hawking- liked @-@ our @-@ paper .
and you as well , mr. our @-@ premise @-@ is @-@ intriguing .
how do you do , mr. i &apos;ll- admit @-@ that &apos;s @-@ pretty @-@ cool ?
yeah , you keep setting me up for failure .
&quot; with a heavy heart ,
&quot; amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine .
she regretted giving cooper the part he needed . &quot;
because she wanted him to give her the part she needed .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
what ?
no ! i really want to know what happens--
and bernadette
really , really , really wants to know what happens .
you &apos;re just making fun of me .
i was just kidding . i &apos;m sorry .
and the story &apos;s really good !
no , it is ! does he stay ?
do they kiss ? does she find out about montana ?
please ?
fine .
&quot; as cooper prepared to depart ,
&quot; tears filled amelia &apos;s eyes .
&quot; he took her hand in his and said , &apos; i can &apos;t stay ,
&quot; but i will never forget you.&apos;
&quot; he brushed his fingers against her cheek ,
&quot; then quickly stepped into the machine .
&quot; &apos; please don &apos;t go , &apos; she whispered .
&quot; but it was too late .
&quot; the engine hummed to life .
but they didn &apos;t even kiss .
&quot; she turned away ,
&quot; wiping her eyes .
&quot; she couldn &apos;t bear to watch
&quot; her one chance at true love disappear forever .
&quot; then ...
she felt a strong hand on her shoulder
&quot; spin her around .
&quot; it was cooper .
yes !
&quot; &apos; what about the future ? &apos; asked amelia .
&quot; he looked deeply into her eyes and whispered ,
&quot; &apos; there is no future without you.&apos;
&quot; he pulled her in close .
&quot; she began to tremble all over .
she felt his warm breath ... &quot;
you will not believe what stephen hawking just said .
get out !
not now !
is the water warm enough ?
given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire ,
draw the water from the well and heat it ,
it would be rude to complain .
but since you asked , it &apos;s a little nippy .
i can fix that .
i couldn &apos;t help but notice your unusual undergarments .
they &apos;re not undergarments .
they &apos;re underoos .
where i come from , they &apos;re known as
&quot; underwear that &apos;s fun to wear . &quot;
and what &apos;s the significance of the spider ?
oh , that represents spider @-@ man .
he does whatever a spider can .
there &apos;s a lot of rhyming in the future , isn &apos;t there ?
you &apos;re right .
this is even weirder than i thought .
you want me to stop reading ?
are you kidding ? no , no .
&quot; as he stood for amelia to dry him ... &quot;
so , tell me , cooper ...
are the ways of physical love different in the future ?
yeah , okay , i &apos;m good .
