i just don &apos;t understand .
yeah , there &apos;s a lot of things you don &apos;t understand .
everyone is wearing a black tie .
you &apos;re wearing a gray tie .
this is acceptable at a black tie affair .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with the tie that i &apos;m wearing .
thank you .
you--
yes , please .
champagne , sir ?
is it ? from the region ? in france ?
because if it &apos;s not , it &apos;s called sparkling wine ,
and i don &apos;t really drink sparkling wine .
forget it .
forgive him .
his parents really wanted a girl . never got over it .
wait a minute . you can taste the difference .
i &apos;m not being a snob .
not a snob ?
you sound like frasier &apos;s brother .
niles crane was completely misunderstood .
okay , boys , you don &apos;t want me to give you a time @-@ out now , do you ?
look , i &apos;d be willing to stand in a corner
if you agree to paddle his bottom .
that &apos;s hilarious . i &apos;m just saying
that if they want us to donate to their charity ,
they might as well step it up .
you know , make me want to give away my money .
your money ?
you &apos;re here representing the firm , louis .
and we &apos;ve always been committed to giving back to the community .
jessica , is that--
tori . yes , and i owe her a call .
excuse me .
do i smell like sausage ?
no more than usual . why ?
uh , because i &apos;m about to meet the future mrs. louis litt .
i had pizza before i came and i just want to
make sure i still am not emanating any aroma .
oh , you &apos;re emanating something .
it &apos;s called pheromones and women find it irresistible .
watch this .
harvey .
you remember tori ?
of course . nice to see you .
i told jessica i don &apos;t really want to talk shop
while we &apos;re here to support a good cause .
well , that &apos;s the beautiful thing about a retainer .
we &apos;re always on call when you need us .
so how can we help ?
it involves one of our most trusted senior vps .
something recently came to light about his past
and i &apos;m shocked by it , really .
you tell us where it hurts and we &apos;ll make it go away .
wait . wait .
wait ?
yeah .
well , it &apos;s just ...
this feels like it &apos;s moving really fast .
i should slow down ?
no , i just--i mean , like--
i just got out of a relationship and ...
right .
you kind of did too .
i wasn &apos;t really seeing anyone .
you know what i mean .
trevor .
yeah , trevor .
right . trevor .
yeah , yeah , you &apos;re right .
we should slow down .
i should make us some tea .
you want some tea ?
mm @-@ hmm , yeah .
yeah , let &apos;s drink some tea .
thank you .
what &apos;s the , uh , harvard club ?
oh , it &apos;s , uh-- it &apos;s , like , this clubhouse for harvard alumni .
yeah , that invite is , uh--
it &apos;s for this networking thing for lawyers .
i got it at work .
hmm , would you go ?
what ? are you kidding me ?
no .
i have a hard enough time pretending at work .
it &apos;s not like i want to enter the lion &apos;s den .
well , if you were gonna go ...
and you were gonna take a date--
it would be you .
i &apos;d love to take you .
who &apos;s moving too fast now ?
oh , well , that &apos;s due to saying all the right things .
hey , what &apos;s the emergency ?
couldn &apos;t find a date to the prom ?
we &apos;re firing stan jacobson .
who ?
senior vice president , drybeck accounting .
our accounting firm ?
yes .
they &apos;re our firm and our client .
how &apos;s that possible ?
they signed a conflict of interest waiver .
look at that .
he &apos;s actually learning how the law works .
acquaint yourself with drybeck &apos;s company charter
and stan &apos;s original employment contract .
what &apos;d he do ?
he lied .
he lied ? about what ?
wait , let me guess . he cooked the books .
god , doesn &apos;t anyone on wall street
put in an honest day &apos;s work anymore ?
actually , he &apos;s got a stellar record as a senior vp .
he lied on his resume .
never got his cpa license .
never even went to business school .
he lied about where he went to school
and now he &apos;s getting fired ?
drybeck does the books for half of wall street .
word gets out that a senior staff is a fraud ,
they &apos;re gonna start bleeding clients .
we have to do this fast and keep it quiet .
relax .
that &apos;s not gonna happen to you .
but i would get fired if jessica found out .
found out what ?
just told me he &apos;s a virgin .
that doesn &apos;t surprise me one bit .
all in due time , mike .
you have those severance quotes ?
oh , where you headed , doll ?
pearson hardman to see mike ross .
uh , he expecting you ?
no , i just was gonna drop this off .
no appointment . i can &apos;t let you up .
do i look like a terrorist ?
do i look like i want to lose my job ?
jenny ?
rachel .
hey . you here to see mike ?
sort of . i just--
i was gonna drop this suit off for him .
harvey called late last night ,
some big emergency ,
and mike ended up staying the night .
actually , could you help me out
i &apos;m running so late to work .
sure .
oh , my god . thank you .
thanks .
thank you .
okay .
oh ! and can you tell mike that i left the key under the mat ?
absolutely .
thank you so much , rachel .
you &apos;re welcome .
you &apos;re amazing .
i &apos;m up . i &apos;m up .
your girlfriend stopped by .
dropped that off for you .
girlfriend ?
you guys move in together already ?
what ? no .
we--she &apos;s not my-- why do you care ?
i don &apos;t . what--
what was the big emergency last night ?
um , harvey .
he &apos;s firing some big vp from our accounting firm this morning .
stan jacobson ?
yeah , why ? you know him ?
no , he was just checking in at reception when i got there .
oh , god ! i got to change .
i will let him know that you will be right there .
thanks .
performance numbers , hr guidelines ,
severance quotes , and stan &apos;s in the waiting room .
did you sleep here last night ?
i wouldn &apos;t exactly call it sleeping .
where &apos;d you get that suit ?
uh , rachel .
no , i mean jenny gave it to rachel downstairs .
she slept over last night .
jenny did , not rachel .
do i really need to be here when you fire this guy ?
you want to learn how it &apos;s done , right ?
i read this guy &apos;s employment records , harvey .
he &apos;s smart , talented , loyal .
oh , and you feel bad for him .
i &apos;m shocked .
where &apos;s my smoking gun ?
background check that confirmed stan lied about his credentials .
it never came through .
on it .
come in , come in .
um , could you help me with something ?
i need to get this fax for harvey and it &apos;s--
good morning .
good morning . he needs a--
you can tell , can &apos;t you ?
i bet you everybody can .
tell what ?
you ... wax your eyebrows ?
i was with the most beautiful woman last night .
she wax your eyebrows ?
we did a lot of things last night
and waxing wasn &apos;t one of them ,
if you know what i mean .
oh , god .
that &apos;s great . i &apos;m here to ask--
her name &apos;s charisse and we have so much in common .
and mike , there was like this--
there was like this , &quot; mmm . &quot;
like a &quot; mmm . &quot;
like a chemical thing would happen
when our bodies would touch .
no , i really don &apos;t want to have this conversation with you .
oh , come on . we &apos;re both guys , right ?
little locker room talk around the office .
i mean , that creates a little male bonding .
that &apos;s crazy . i just heard my name .
did you hear that ? someone &apos;s calling me .
i &apos;m gonna-- just one second , okay ?
he &apos;s probably still a virgin .
mr. jacobson , hi .
mike ross , harvey &apos;s associate .
so sorry to keep you waiting .
just gonna be a couple more minutes , okay ?
okay , great . thank you .
yes , i hear you .
your office couldn &apos;t find a copy .
can you tell me the name of the security firm
you guys used to do the background check ?
okay , great .
nope . that &apos;s great .
i found the number myself . thank you .
sally , yes .
this is mike ross for pearson hardman .
i &apos;m calling regarding
a background check you guys did .
sure .
you could refuse to cooperate ,
but then you would be wrong .
sally , hold on one minute .
yeah ?
no . stan is going to be there in two minutes .
he &apos;s in the bathroom . okay .
sally , you there ?
let &apos;s do this .
i &apos;m gonna fax you the subpoena
that i &apos;m holding in my hand right now
and you can show that to your boss and then we--
great .
let me send you my fax number now .
nice .
stan .
we ready ?
yes . i &apos;m sorry about that .
no worries .
i know you , by the way .
7611053 .
your employee code .
see , i remember everyone that way .
anyway , you are taking me to see harvey .
i have been dying to meet him .
why is that ?
his balls .
his autographed ones .
i &apos;m a huge baseball fan .
right . really ?
oh , yeah , yeah . no .
if i wasn &apos;t an accountant ,
i would be a major league scout .
i can tell you anything you want to know
just by looking at somebody &apos;s numbers .
for instance , slugging percentage
versus strikeouts during spring training--
do you want to walk and talk maybe ?
stan jacobson .
mr. specter , it is a pleasure .
stan , it &apos;s nice to meet you .
has mike alr--
oh , my god !
oh , my god ! is that them ?
oh ! jeter .
hank aaron .
no way ! maris ?
that &apos;s not number 61 , is it ?
no , but it was signed by tracy--
stallard .
big baseball fan .
stan , why don &apos;t you have a seat over here ?
why don &apos;t i get us some waters ?
sorry .
i get talking about baseball , i cannot stop .
i know how valuable your time is .
i do do the books .
and speaking of which , your assistant tells me
you wanted to go over something from your last audits .
i could really use a water .
stan , we &apos;re not here to go over any accounting business .
you &apos;re here because you &apos;re being let go .
what ?
it &apos;s not gonna feel that surprising
when you understand why .
the firm looked into your background recently .
they know you lied about passing the cpa exam .
you were hired because of your outstanding credentials
and the reality is they never existed .
i &apos;ve been there for nine years .
my work has been nothing but--
i mean , why would this even matter now ?
you have been committing fraud your entire career .
the liability it presents--
no ! i don &apos;t accept this .
okay , take a deep breath .
once you go over the severance numbers ,
you &apos;ll see that we &apos;ve been more than fair .
fair ?
you think this is fair ?
we understand how difficult this must be , stan .
how you must feel right now .
you have no idea what i feel right now .
just so i &apos;m clear--
you &apos;re not denying what we &apos;re presenting you with ?
you mean that i lied back
when drybeck hired me ?
no .
but i &apos;m not some scam artist either .
i did go to college .
i just couldn &apos;t afford to graduate .
no one ever questioned it before
because i &apos;m that good with numbers .
then they find out all of a sudden .
they didn &apos;t .
this background check is five years old .
what ?
that doesn &apos;t make sense .
is this the original ?
yeah .
so tori knew all this time ?
this is the same thing that happened to paula .
who ?
paula .
discovered some undisclosed income ,
the books weren &apos;t adding up , she brought it to me .
the next thing i know , she is gone .
i asked tori about it , then i start
getting shut out of meetings .
they &apos;re trying to hide something
and they &apos;re firing me so they can .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m not signing some agreement .
are you kidding me ?
i &apos;m getting railroaded !
should i go after him ?
no .
you &apos;ve done enough already .
so you let him leave ?
physically restraining someone
is not in my job description .
what about your associate ,
the one who shared the background check ?
that was a confidential internal document .
stan should have never seen it .
why did you even have it ?
you didn &apos;t expect us to fire him without proof , did you ?
tori &apos;s right . stan shouldn &apos;t have seen it .
then i &apos;m guilty of being thorough .
i still don &apos;t understand why you haven &apos;t
told us the whole truth .
i mean , if you knew five years ago ,
why &apos;d you make it sound like this is something recent ?
because it only came to my attention two days ago .
then who ordered the background check ?
it &apos;s routine . you check with human resources .
is it routine for human resources
to keep something from the ceo for half a decade ?
what are you insinuating ?
i think what harvey is saying is given
how quickly we tried to accomplish this ,
some of the details might have gotten lost .
what was also lost is that stan
never signed the severance package ,
which included the confidentiality agreement ,
which means if he decides to make waves ,
the whole point of
avoiding negative publicity--
harvey will track down stan
and make sure that he signs the severance package
and the confidentiality agreement today .
you have my word .
thank you .
of course .
it &apos;s allight , tori .
she &apos;s lying .
she knew about stan .
she &apos;s known for a long time .
and that matters to us why ?
because she &apos;s taking advantage of us .
we are being manipulated into firing
one of her employees and told not to ask questions .
well , i have questions .
and the answer is ten .
as in $ 10 million per year ,
the amount of business drybeck generates for this firm .
which means you have to finish what you started .
find stan and get him to sign those documents .
and as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
that little associate of yours is to blame for all of this .
that was an honest mistake .
he knowingly revealed
the client &apos;s confidential document .
that is not a mistake .
how many more chances are you gonna give that kid ?
oh , i didn &apos;t realize we were keeping score .
but if that &apos;s the case , i still think he &apos;s coming out ahead .
whatever you &apos;re doing , stop .
wait , you &apos;re gonna want to see this .
paula o &apos;neil , the former drybeck employee that stan mentioned ,
she filed a wrongful termination suit
that mysteriously went away .
really ? let me see that .
come with me .
wait . do you not think something funny &apos;s going on ?
you know what ? here &apos;s what i think is going on .
you &apos;re sympathizing with stan because you think he &apos;s you .
that doesn &apos;t mean that--
you need to learn something from what just happened ,
not the least of which is how anyone ,
no matter how valuable , can be let go .
i can chalk up what happened with stan
to youthful exuberance , but jessica can &apos;t .
so if you want to work here , you better go home now ,
because if she sees you--
wait , wait .
is she gonna fire me ?
this habit of you empathizing with every client ,
it &apos;s not getting you anywhere .
you want to work in this firm ?
you need to deal in facts ,
evidence , information that can hold up .
that &apos;s what a real lawyer does .
stan .
did you follow me here ?
doesn &apos;t take a sleuth to figure out
that your next step would be to see another lawyer .
bopal and williams .
they &apos;re a good firm . not the friendliest bunch .
they called you .
that is against lawyer @-@ client privilege .
no one &apos;s breaking any laws , okay ?
my assistant has a network of other assistants
that tell her anything she wants to know ,
like when someone calls for an emergency appointment .
you forgot this when you left .
i said i &apos;m not signing anything .
it &apos;s nothing to sign .
it &apos;s a lawsuit .
you worked for drybeck for 9 years ,
oversaw 80 clients , filed hundreds of tax returns ,
and fought 27 audits .
now , in light of your recently discovered fraud ,
all of that can now be called into question .
therefore , you are being sued for nine years back pay ,
plus any expenses incurred to mitigate the damage you &apos;ve done .
this is--
this would bankrupt me .
or you can take what &apos;s behind door number two .
it &apos;s aberdeen .
who ?
it &apos;s not a &quot; who . &quot; it &apos;s a &quot; what . &quot;
drybeck is doing business with them
and i think that &apos;s where the problem lies .
you don &apos;t get it , okay ?
i &apos;m only leaving with one of these ,
and if it &apos;s the lawsuit ,
the first thing your friends upstairs
are gonna ask you for is a big , fat retainer .
and when you tell them that harvey specter
is the one that &apos;s suing you ,
you &apos;re gonna watch the color drain from their faces .
now what would you like to do ?
this is not cool .
you leave me in your apartment all night
and say you &apos;re gonna be right back .
you don &apos;t even thank me for dropping off your suit .
i had a bad day , jenny .
so you couldn &apos;t call me ?
i almost got fired , okay ?
what happened ?
it--it &apos;s not worth explaining .
okay . i need to find evidence
that our accounting firm is up to something ,
so i found this woman who filed a wrongful termination suit
against them , but then she referred me to her lawyer .
did you call them ?
yeah , but they &apos;re this huge firm .
unger and macy .
they wouldn &apos;t take my call .
why not ?
there &apos;s a confidentiality clause in the settlement , for one .
so ?
so it means that they can &apos;t share details like that .
you know , i thought all lawyers secretly shared that stuff .
you &apos;re all in the same club , right ?
what ? that &apos;s not a dumb thing to assume .
no , no , no , no .
that &apos;s not dumb at all , because ...
unger and macy have almost as many harvard grads
as we do , which means--
they &apos;re gonna be at the mixer tonight .
and there are two things that lawyers love to do .
drink and talk .
hi .
hi .
uh , mike ross , class of 2011 .
ross .
sorry , i don &apos;t have you on here .
do you have your i.d. ?
i can n it through the computer .
uh , my harvard i.d. ?
what did you say your name was again ?
michael ross of pearson hardman .
boy , you think they ask harvey for his i.d.
when he comes to this place ?
harvey specter ?
you work with harvey specter ?
uh , yeah , yes .
i &apos;m his associate .
i can call him if you like .
just don &apos;t tell him i gave you any trouble , okay ?
welcome .
thank you .
oh , god . i &apos;m never gonna survive this .
deep breaths . you &apos;ll be fine .
i saw the signed severance papers on my desk .
thank you .
i also left word for tori .
yes , we spoke .
she &apos;s relieved , but i wouldn &apos;t go so far
as to say completely forgiving .
you ever heard of aberdeen solutions ?
drybeck listed them as a consultant firm .
they bill us every month for their management services .
okay .
what does that mean ?
check with accounting .
i did .
they can only tell me how much we pay them ,
so i called aberdeen directly .
it &apos;s an automated answering system .
i left six messages . no returns .
stan mentioned it .
something just doesn &apos;t feel right .
are you saying you want to investigate our client ?
they &apos;re also our accountants .
and tori is also a friend .
harvey , if you got caught--
i wouldn &apos;t get caught .
i am explicitly telling you not to do this .
well , then i &apos;ll let you know what i don &apos;t find
after i don &apos;t look into it .
hey , should we get the rest of the 2010 grads
with us for a pic ?
the rest ? this is 2011 . no way .
isn &apos;t he from the 2010 class ?
no , no . i was 2011 .
you &apos;re not with us .
yeah , rudy ... it &apos;s mike .
you know , we-- we hung out a bunch .
where ?
oh , you know what ?
maybe i &apos;m thinking about somebody else .
sorry about that .
has anyone seen that guy here before ?
i &apos;m not having any luck .
wish i could say different , love .
but it &apos;s been a potter &apos;s field for me too .
what ?
you get to pretend to be someone else .
i wanted to try . it &apos;s fun .
accent ? hmm .
okay , i &apos;ll stop .
what ?
you &apos;re amazing .
and that &apos;s brian jennings .
who &apos;s brian jennings ?
i saw his face on unger and macy &apos;s website today .
what are you waiting for ? go .
hi .
ten days for public exposure .
next time you need a bathroom in times square ,
go into a hotel .
five @-@ minute recess .
harvey .
long time , anthony .
you keep company with the high rollers on center street .
what are you doing down in night court ?
i need a favor .
what kind of favor ?
one that requires access to sealed court documents .
can it wait till tomorrow ?
i got this backlog of case--
when you came to me two years ago in the middle of the night ,
did i tell you it had to wait till tomorrow ?
my chambers .
so ... this is quite a surprise .
who &apos;d ever think that you and i would on a double date ?
excuse me ?
oh , come on .
you had to notice when you walked in the room .
she &apos;s absolutely gorgeous .
and she &apos;s completely infatuated with your girlfriend .
come on .
come on , i &apos;ll introduce you to her .
charisse , honey ...
uh , this is one of my associates , mike ross .
oh , so nice to meet you .
and i &apos;m in love with your date .
seriously .
she &apos;s just been telling me about her work with monkeys .
it &apos;s fascinating .
so really , they &apos;re as smart as us ?
oh , smarter .
i never had a chance with him .
i need to use the ladies &apos; room .
would you excuse me ?
monkeys aren &apos;t smarter than humans , sorry .
that depends on which humans you &apos;re talking about , i guess .
what ?
huh ?
name of case and rough date ?
aberdeen versus paula o &apos;neil ,
say six months ago .
oh , let &apos;s see .
says here that they were listed as a subsidiary of drybeck
in a wrongful termination suit .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s what i &apos;m looking for .
i can &apos;t print this out . i &apos;ll get tagged .
come around . take a look .
is that what you &apos;re after ?
yeah , that &apos;s it .
but what &apos;s that ?
that links to another court filing in relation to aberdeen .
click on it .
says here that they filed for dissolution ...
earlier today .
the whole company ?
that &apos;s what it says .
they &apos;re officially shut down .
i &apos;m gonna need one more favor .
i think it &apos;s great that you found someone
not in law who works out in the real world .
why do you say that ?
because i &apos;m stuck in a suit all day
or an office or a courtroom .
i think it &apos;d be nice to be in nature .
don &apos;t you , mike ?
well , i love that you &apos;re a lawyer .
in fact , i &apos;d love to see where you work sometime .
you would ?
i &apos;m not feeling so well all of a sudden .
no .
yeah .
you think we can go ?
yeah .
right now ?
now . yeah .
so great to meet you .
lovely to meet you .
have good night .
okay , why didn &apos;t you do that sooner ?
because ... i had to get this first .
that &apos;s the guy , right ? from the firm .
that &apos;s his employee i.d.
he gave this to you ?
no , i stole it .
what ?
listen , you could spend all night trying to get to the guy
or you could just go into his firm yourself and look .
come on .
let &apos;s go .
yeah , i can barely keep my eyes open myself .
filing briefs sucks .
you actually came .
you must be harvey specter .
&quot; joe , &quot; was it ?
your friend fill you in on the deal that &apos;s on the table ?
let me just get it straight .
you caught him rifling through some files ,
and in lieu of calling the police ,
you want me to pay you off ?
i never said that .
he did .
oh , that &apos;s great .
this way , if i level a charge of extortion ,
it &apos;s hearsay , huh ?
ten years working for a law firm ,
you learn a thing or two , which is good ,
&apos;cause you sure as hell don &apos;t make a lot of money doing it .
somehow i think you &apos;re getting by fine .
just saying , on the level you guys play at ,
espionage happens all the time , which is why i know
you &apos;ll do anything to protect your secrets .
well actually , joe speena , of 2561 clover lane ,
astoria , queens , i think we all would .
like those tax returns you filed jointly
for the last six years while no longer living with your wife .
you know , the irs can destroy you for that .
you think you &apos;re the first person to try to extort me , joe ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s the level i play at .
now ... you &apos;re a security guard
who likes to take risks .
i like that .
so here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
this here &apos;s a generous donation
to joey junior &apos;s little league team .
now , if it gets to them , it gets to them .
if it doesn &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t .
but the next time we talk ,
it &apos;s gonna be me who wants a favor .
officer .
do i really need to pay you back ?
let &apos;s start with an explanation .
you said i needed to find evidence ,
so i went to find some .
by breaking into another law firm ?
is that really worse than paying off a security guard ?
okay , first of all , i didn &apos;t pay him off .
second of all , if i hadn &apos;t paid him off ,
you &apos;d be in jail right now .
you think i might be right about stan .
no , i never said you were wrong .
i said we needed evidence .
but did you find something ?
drybeck bought a shelf company 13 months ago .
what &apos;s a shelf company ?
it &apos;s a corporation that exists only on paper ,
so its owners can hide their assets .
isn &apos;t that a shell company ?
no , it &apos;s a shelf company .
okay , take a shell company , give it a bank account ,
credit history , tax returns ,
and let it season for years on a shelf .
someone buys it , sloth their name into it ,
and they walk away with an established corporation
with a preexisting history .
anyone looks any closer ,
they shut it down and do it again .
that &apos;s legal ?
shelf companies are legal .
i &apos;m guessing what tori &apos;s doing with hers isn &apos;t .
wait a minute . is it called &quot; aberdeen &quot; ?
yeah , i saw it on the top of this list
with 37 other management companies
all related to drybeck in that wrongful termination suit .
when we get back to the office ,
i want you to find legal precedent
that will allow us to subpoena the records .
okay , on it .
do i really have to pay you back ?
every penny .
wait a minute .
how much was in that envelope ?
hey , what are you all doing at my desk ?
dude , you got to check this out .
excuse me . excuse me .
is that louis ?
uh @-@ huh . in the lobby .
is this a security camera ? a live feed ?
what are you guys doing ?
no , no .
this is from last night .
the guys in security emailed it up to louis this morning .
and why are we watching it on my computer ?
well , we &apos;re not gonna risk watching it on one of ours .
and everyone knows your password .
how does everybody know my password ?
&quot; ross999 . &quot;
how hard is that to crack ?
okay , &quot; 999 &quot; increases the odds of--
oh , shh ! here it comes .
what ?
oh , no .
what did he say to her ?
oh , evidently louis wants a restraining order
and he needs this asvidence .
what ?
uh , um , it--
okay , listen . please don &apos;t .
i came in here and it--
look , i--
are you okay now ?
louis ?
if the message you left was another trick to get me down here ...
no tricks , i assure you . come on in .
stan , i &apos;m jessica pearson .
oh , yeah . i know who you are .
you said if i accepted the severance agreement ,
there wouldn &apos;t be a lawsuit .
well , there is one ,
but not against you .
with you .
we know about aberdeen .
we know what tori was orchestrating .
and with your help , we can expose her .
why should i help you ?
what have you got to lose ?
tell me what you need me to do .
what does he have you trying to find this time ?
you really want to know ?
uh , i managed to get a look at some files
involving our accounting firm .
what &apos;s up with our accounting firm ?
they &apos;re stealing from us .
you know your phone bill ?
you have all those surcharges ,
you have no idea what they mean , but you pay &apos; em anyway .
yeah .
yeah , well , drybeck &apos;s doing the same thing to us ,
except all their charges are a complete scam .
pretty sure the phone charges are scams , too .
yeah , maybe .
so what do you need ?
i need a legal reason to get those files
without saying i saw those files .
you need them for court or you just need them ?
why ?
you said you read &apos; em , right ?
yeah .
so then you already have them ...
in here .
you &apos;re right . i do .
yes , so you dictate , i &apos;ll type .
what ?
you &apos;d actually do that for me ?
they &apos;re stealing from us .
person hardman is my firm too .
come on .
okay .

that might reasonably be anticipated ...
we acknowledge that such appointment is irrevocable

what ?
your mind &apos;s amazing too .
oh , thank you .
thank you .
who you calling this late ?
she &apos;s waiting up for you ?
yeah , i guess you &apos;re right . it &apos;s pretty late .
she &apos;s probably sleeping by now .
i &apos;ll just text her .
it &apos;s tough to have a relationship with the first year
or any year .
you just don &apos;t have a life .
how &apos;d you make it work ?
who said i did ?
it &apos;s--it &apos;s impossible to have anything long @-@ term
unless you find someone that has the same
80 @-@ hour work week and then ...
that doesn &apos;t work either , because they &apos;re busy too .
yeah , well , i &apos;m not gonna let that be the reason
that jenny and i don &apos;t--
what are you two still doing here ?
uh , it &apos;s for harvey .
nothing .
uh , but we &apos;re done .
good night .
yeah , i &apos;ll see you later .
good night .
bye .
bye .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re aware of this ,
but , um , i &apos;m just gonna remind you anyway .
um , this office frowns upon relationships in the workplace .
yeah .
oh , god ! i &apos;m so sorry .
that &apos;s okay .
uh , thank you for last night .
the typing .
of cour--right .
absolutely .
it was really helpful .
um , hold on one second .
sorry . hello ?
i said i needed you in my office .
and i said i was on my way .
save it . those the files ?
yes , take them , please .
stan is in my office . meet us in the conference room .
okay .
sorry to keep you waiting .
that &apos;s okay .
i got your email with a list of other law firms .
i respect your effort to make amends
by referring new clients .
hat wasn &apos;t a list for client referrals .
those are firms you should consider for representation .
we &apos;re no longer your attorneys , tori .
what ?
we have no choice really .
it would be impossible to represent you
when we plan on suing you for every penny you &apos;ve got .
is this a joke ?
aberdeen solutions .
created in june of 2006 .
sold to drybeck 2010 .
dissolved two days ago .
before that , it was bolton finances .
and before that , it was norton services ,
littleton llc .
where did you get those ?
we know what you did , tori .
you couldn &apos;t have subpoenaed these files .
and yet we have them .
take a look . they &apos;re all there .
and now we have proof .
proof of what ?
those are all legitimate corporations used for--
stealing money and lining your own pockets .
but don &apos;t take my word for it .
guys ?
hello , tori .
yeah , we hired stan to do a little
independent consulting on our behalf
and he &apos;s come up with some very interesting connections .
it was easy , even if i don &apos;t really have a degree .
there was that vacation you invited me on last year ...
to your new house in the bahamas .
a house you bought with money you stole from this firm .
my firm .
jessica--
&quot; jessica &quot; what ?
you can &apos;t use any of this .
we have attorney @-@ client privilege .
with drybeck accounting , yes .
with the shelf companies ? no .
and unfortunately for you ,
you &apos;re listed on the shelf companies .
you stole from me .
you either come clean now
or the only time you &apos;ll see your children in the next decade
will be during prison visiting hours .
so i &apos;m gonna get my job back now , right ?
i don &apos;t see why not .
no , stan , you &apos;re not .
what ?
drybeck &apos;s going bankrupt after this all shakes out .
even if they don &apos;t , they &apos;re not gonna hire you back .
why ?
because you falsified your resume .
what am i supposed to do now ?
well , we just got you more than your severance package .
i suggest you use it to tide yourself over
till you figure something out .
stan ... hey .
your best asset is your mind .
they can &apos;t take that from you .
one little mistake .
you could go back to school , become legitimate .
start over ?
i never should have done it .
told you they wouldn &apos;t catch me .
what are you looking for , harvey ?
positive reinforcement ?
nothing major .
a trophy , nobel .
would your likeness in bronze in the lobby be okay ?
bust or life @-@ size ?
you did a good thing , harvey .
well , it wasn &apos;t just me , you know ?
well , then i guess i should give the kid
the benefit of the doubt from now on .
you should .
well , you &apos;ll be happy to know
that stan has no idea what he &apos;s gonna do with the rest of his life .
that doesn &apos;t make me happy .
well , what if i tell you i have no idea what i &apos;m doing with mine ?
what the hell are we gonna do when i get caught , harvey ?
you &apos;re not gonna get caught .
that &apos;s your answer ?
what else is there ?
why ?
what ?
hire me . why would you do that to me ?
you mean for you .
no , i don &apos;t .
you made it perfectly clear
that you only do things for yourself . so why ?
you mean the reason why i became a lawyer
or your friend dealt drugs or you used to cheat ?
i cheated because i needed--
you couldn &apos;t make money any other way ? bullshit .
life is this .
i like this .
that &apos;s not me .
well , if it wasn &apos;t me , you wouldn &apos;t be here .
so if you want this to stop , all you got to do is tap out .
hello .
you &apos;re here to see mike .
we &apos;re gonna celebrate his victory .
you know , i actually think that it &apos;s a really ,
really good idea that you &apos;ve come to pick him up .
in fact , if i were you , i &apos;d do it a little more often .
just all those late nights working with rachel .
what do you mean ?
what do i--
well , come on . you &apos;re a smart girl .
you understand animal behavior .
i think you can figure it out .
hey . you ready ?
