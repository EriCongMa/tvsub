beautiful thought . who put that up ?
my sister . who else ?
why you keep it up there if you don &apos;t find it inspirational ?
my daughter likes it .
everybody keeps telling me how lucky i am .

attending staff gave you 20 to one .
you read the paper ?
my own uncle puts me through this .
new gunshot . rapper . da lux .

he &apos;s still got all his pancreas , though .
all done .
fiona .
look , i &apos;ve been feeling ...
i don &apos;t know ,
not myself ,
since i woke up from the coma .
my thoughts keep running away with me .
these feelings ? they &apos;ll pass .
it &apos;s very common in post @-@ surgical patients .
maybe you &apos;d like to talk to someone . social worker ?
hey , babe , how ya feeling ?
oh , good , good .
that candy striper out there ,
there &apos;s not much of a selection .
there was something on &quot; sink the bismarck ,
&quot; but half the pages were gone .
but you like dinosaurs .
having surgery tomorrow .
they say they &apos;re closing me up .
gus !
jason , my condolences .
your dad was the best boss any of us ever had .
we &apos;re sad to hear you &apos;re selling the company .
i &apos;ve been going over the books .
we &apos;re paying an anthony soprano
the second @-@ highest salary in the company .
he &apos;s a consultant .
where do i reach him ?
i want to make some changes , but his office is full of junk .
there &apos;s a 55 @-@ horse johnson outboard on the desk .
looks like nobody &apos;s ever there .
he &apos;s in the hospital .
you should talk to his colleague , mr. gaultieri .
paulie ?
oh , tony soprano . of course .
i knew him when i was a kid . he was a friend of the family .
i &apos;m having surgery tomorrow . i &apos;m not supposed to eat !
you fucking believe this ?
always something .
so anyway , she was crying the entire night
and i didn &apos;t get any sleep .
why don &apos;t you ride on the fucking zephyrs and sleep on a cloud ?
what , you think i put that up there ?
i didn &apos;t .
right .
who then ?
hello . i can &apos;t hear--
yeah-- talk louder !
nanny .
between the reception and her language skills ...
i suppose you got a little choo @-@ choo train at home , huh ?
takes your toast right from the kitchen , delivers it to your bedroom ?
look , ton &apos; -- i &apos;m sorry about what happened
with junior and the shooting , but--
don &apos;t mention junior to me ever again .
i &apos;ll tell you this , bobby--
you can &apos;t hide behind this brother @-@ in @-@ law shit forever .
you &apos;re an okay guy , but each and every man
is judged on his own merit .
have you heard the good news ?
jesus christ !
that &apos;s right .
aaron arkaway , jan &apos;s friend .
oh yeah , right .
we &apos;re protesting downstairs and ...
i saw jan in the elevator this morning .
she told me you were up here .
that &apos;s what all that yelling and singing is ?
the druggist from the hospital pharmacy was fired
for refusing to fill birth control prescriptions .
we &apos;re trying to get his job back .
tony , this is our prayer leader , bob brewster .
hi , aaron &apos;s told me a lot about you .
i thought we &apos;d come up and pray with you .
bottom feeding , huh ?
it &apos;s where the big fish are .
son of a fuckin &apos; bitch !
they cut my morphine ,
trying to wean me off .
you know , i &apos;ve seen people delivered from unbelievable pain ...
myself included .
oh yeah ?
i was at rock bottom .
i was addicted to cocaine and strippers .
then i lost my wife and i crashed my car , drunk .
ended up upside down , hanging by my seat belt , completely terrified .
then i prayed for god to save me .
and he came in .
praise him .
and in that moment , i was reborn .
and i see you there and i know you &apos;re hurting .
and the answer is to accept the lord as your personal savior .
well i got all this covered , you know , with my parish priest .
that &apos;s great , but what god wants
is for you to love him directly ,
not necessarily through the intercession of liturgy
or any human agent .
ls this aaron arkaway ?
hey .
what are you fellas doing here ?
mrs. soprano .
we were just dialoguing with your husband .
we were about to pray .
they were .
you &apos;re having surgery tomorrow .
you know they &apos;ve done clinical studies about the power of prayer .
prayed @-@ for patients have 11 % fewer complications .
i have read that . it does help to pray .
i mean even if it just takes your mind off it .
dear jesus ...
hear these words and bestow your loving , healing grace
upon our injured friend . lord , help heal his wounds
and help him with your cleansing love .
where sin abounds ,
grace abounds even more .
amen .
amen .
amen .
amen .
so , reverend , let me , uh--
let me ask you about this guy not selling birth control .
he should be free to exercise his moral convictions
without suffering loss of livelihood .
well here &apos;s what i &apos;m getting at-- i &apos;m-- i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m worried about viagra .
the way i see it , i &apos;m gonna need plenty of that ,
considering my condition and ...
what if somebody decides that viagra is wrong and god don &apos;t like it ?
well , god loves procreation .
no one &apos;s saying anything against viagra .
birth control in the name of the morning @-@ after pill is a sin
because it strikes at life , at the unborn .
yeah but what if somebody goes after viagra ?
i &apos;m not talking about procreation
and listen up , &apos; cause this affects you too .
something like viagra will never be an issue .
excuse me , but at one time they were going after booze ,
and as a proprietor of a drinking and eating establishment ,
i take this stuff very seriously .
strip club , i believe it is .
oh , you &apos;ve been to the bing ?
no .
he should rest .
thank you so much for coming , pastor , and aaron .
thank you so much for your prayer .
sure .
yeah , really i ...
i really appreciate it .
bye , guys . praise god .
what are you , a wiseass ?
what ?
what &apos;d i do ?
oh my god .
what is it , doctor ?
i just found jimmy hoffa .
in montana , the fossilized remains of a tyrannosaurus rex
yielded soft tissue that indicated a definite link
between dinosaurs and modern birds .
look who i got here .
ho , the sanitation prince .
hi , tony . i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re not feeling well .
thank you . sorry about your loss .
your father and i were very close .
remember my daughter meadow ? jason barone .
hi .
hey .
remember when you were a kid ,
at that field box at shea , opening day ?
me , you , your dad and paulie here ?
oh yeah . kingman was just back from the cubs .
mookie wilson hit that foul tip , beaned that guy in the loge .
i gotta get to the office . finn &apos;s picking me up .
i &apos;ll be back later .
sweetheart ,
thank you for everything .
okay . don &apos;t wear him out .
she wants to be a doctor .
also considering law .
so , you &apos;re living in deer valley ?
yeah , ski instructor .
so , paulie tells me you &apos;re thinking of selling
your father &apos;s business to chuckie cinelli .
yeah , i think it &apos;s the best thing for mom .
and of course , tony , there &apos;d be a severance package for you .
frankly , jason , i don &apos;t think
you should sell the business right now .
there &apos;s a lot of potential buyers out there .
when i get out of the hospital , run the numbers ,
get you the best price .
no , cinelli &apos;s offer seemed fair .
there &apos;s lots of things to take into account .
you even know what your ebitda is ?
my what ?
earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization .
gives the true picture of a company &apos;s profitability .
jas , you let me handle this .
i don &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
the carting business--
it &apos;s a different corporate culture .
you &apos;re tired , t. we &apos;ll leave . come on .
all right . bye , tony .
we &apos;re afraid she doesn &apos;t have long left .
i &apos;m surprised she didn &apos;t call ma .
well she asked specifically to see you .
ooh , madonn &apos; .
paulie .
aunt dottie . hold on a sec .
it &apos;s chilly in here .
i &apos;m burning up . i &apos;m burning up .
i brought you some pignolis and ...
a new pair of those speedo skin @-@ diver socks you like .
look at those . the treads are all gone .
you slip on the linoleum again , then where are we ?
paulie , i gotta tell you--
just a sec .
sister , please give me a hand here .
put these on my aunt , will ya ?
paulie , you should know ...
speak up , aunt dot .
i was ...
i was a bad girl .
how could you be a bad girl ?
you &apos;re a nun .
these are too small .
no they ain &apos;t . they &apos;re supposed to be snug so she don &apos;t slip .
put &apos; em on .
paulie ...
during the war , i was still a novitiate .
i was helping out at the uso ,
and there was this soldier-- russ .
and he was so lonely--
aunt dottie , if this is going where i think ,
maybe you should talk to a priest .
i got pregnant .
i had a baby .
a baby ?
listen to her . the alzheimer &apos;s is gettin &apos; to her .
you didn &apos;t have no baby .
i did . i did have a baby .
paulie ... it was you .

but ...
but ma ... ?
marianuccia is your aunt .
i &apos;m your ma .
i was a bad girl .
good afternoon , mr. soprano . how are you doing ?
better now .
i &apos;m glad to hear that .
where they been keepin &apos; you ?
the other doctors around here--
it &apos;s like the united colors of benetton .
i &apos;m not a doctor .
i &apos;m a utilization review specialist .
i represent your insurance carrier .
it &apos;s my job , together with your physicians ,
to see how fast we can get you out of this place and back home .
well this is good . they &apos;ve closed your incision
and you &apos;re ambulatory now and i see they got the foley out .
you wanna kick me out of here .
well , a hospital stay costs a lot of money .
my bowels don &apos;t work . i &apos;m in pain .
i just got operated on , for christ &apos;s sake .
perhaps your bowels would be working better
if you hadn &apos;t tried to eat the sausage sandwich on 3 / 28 .
i don &apos;t believe this . with all the money i &apos;ve been contributing
over the years , you wanna put me in the street .
look , you think we &apos;re the enemy , but if you hadn &apos;t had insurance ,
you would have ended up at the county hospital .
it &apos;s a good thing that you had your card with you
when they performed the wallet biopsy .
the what ?
in the ambulance .
if you hadn &apos;t had your card with you ,
they would have dropped your butt at martin luther king .
the &quot; wallet biopsy &quot; ?
get out of my room , you sick cunt .
you &apos;re doing great .
mrs. soprano ? doctor taschlin &apos;s on the phone for you .
can you sit here for a minute , ton &apos; ?
yeah , i &apos;m winded .
he says he &apos;s downhearted .
i tried to explain to him
there &apos;s an upside to everything .
yeah , man .
i know it &apos;s a difficult struggle ,
but let &apos;s lead with some good news for a change .
yeah . &quot; armor gettin &quot; cd
is now charting number five , arrow up .
look , frankly the shooting couldn &apos;t have come at a better time .
yeah , but it really hurts .

seven caps ! tupac ain &apos;t get near that .
and 50 , he only got two more .

huh ?
it &apos;s that fucking john . he &apos;s sitting in the can .
the feds are trying to take everything he &apos;s got .
he &apos;s in a panic state .
i &apos;m sensitive to that .
but whatever happens to barone sanitation ,
i gotta be kept on . i need that w @-@ 2 .
and as you can see , i &apos;m facing a long convalescence here .
and barone is my secondary insurance carrier . i need it .
john &apos;s gonna take care of you . you know that , tony .

so i understand .
t , this is the guy , the paramedic .
&quot; wallet biopsy &quot; ? nice .
very nice .
these people are saying i took money from your wallet ? fuck that .
whoa , whoa , whoa . what &apos;d you say ?
i was looking for proof of insurance .
i was only doing my job .
they heard a lot of that at nuremberg .
you owe me two k. it was gone from my wallet .
i don &apos;t have that kind of money .
one week , rudy diaz ,
or you &apos;ll need a paramedic .
oh , nice of you to come by .
we &apos;ll see you next week , huh ?

fucker keeps dropping his hands .
your boy &apos;s getting tired .

what price they give you on alvarez ?
350 .
damn !
oh man .
hold the motherfucker steady !
my friend here &apos;ll give you 375 .
right , paulie ?
he don &apos;t even wanna fight , man .
wonder what kind of health insurance he &apos;s got .
it &apos;s a life of abuse .
yes , well he is a boxer .
it &apos;s the same for everybody .
look at you , t. you do your uncle a kindness ,
you get shot for your efforts .
you think you got family , but in the end ,
they fuck you too .
he &apos;s grieving . his aunt just died .
i tell ya , we each and every one of us ,
we &apos;re alone in the ring , fighting for our lives ,
just like that poor prick .
well , that &apos;s one way to look at it .
you got a better one ?
don &apos;t get me started .
it &apos;s complicated . - you think i &apos;m stupid ? !
it &apos;s actually an illusion those two boxers are separate entities .
what the fuck ?
illusion ?
their separate entities is simply the way we choose to perceive them .
i didn &apos;t chose nothing .
it &apos;s physics .
schr枚dinger &apos;s equation .
the boxers , you , me-- we &apos;re all part of the same quantum field .
you ever substitute teach at carver middle school ?
he &apos;s a rocket scientist , for christ &apos;s sake . bell labs .
shit . lift it up , nigga !
you were saying ?
well , think of the two boxers as ocean waves
or currents of air , two tornadoes , say .
they appear to be two things , right ? two separate things .
but they &apos;re not . tornadoes are just wind ,
the wind stirred up in different directions .
the fact is , nothing is separate-- everything &apos;s connected .
everything is everything .
i &apos;m down with that .
get the fuck out of here .
the universe is just one big soup of molecules ...
... bumping up against one another .
the shapes we see exist only in our own consciousness .
keshawn , don &apos;t make me come over there .
you &apos;re so fucking smart , fix that tv .
okay , okay .
besides the financial ramifications ,
he says there &apos;s the issue of his w @-@ 2 and health insurance .
that selfish prick .
i &apos;m sitting in here facing a shitstorm
and all he can think about is himself ? !
as far as the sale &apos;s concerned ,
that ship has sailed . it &apos;s going through ,
and as a friend , i would appreciate tony &apos;s help .
because he &apos;s a friend , here &apos;s what i &apos;m willing to do .
cinelli will retain him as waste management consultant for two years .
during that time , he can keep his fucking w @-@ 2 and his health insurance .
plus 5 % of the sale price .
and we lease him a new car .
are you fuckin &apos; kidding me ?
i told them i need that w @-@ 2 in perpetuity ,
and 5 % of the fucking sale price ? !
he thinks &apos; cause i &apos;m in this weakened condition ,
he can take advantage . well , he can go fuck himself .
i &apos;m just telling you what phil told me , ton &apos; .
you tell jason before he sells ,
he better understand his obligation !
what &apos;s up , paulie ?
since even with tony &apos;s advice , you seem determined
to sell your father &apos;s company , there &apos;s something you should know .
whatever happens , we gotta be taken care of .
yeah , of course . i &apos;m going to honor whatever provisions
are in the contract . - fuck the contract .
tony &apos;s given years of his life to that company ,
and he expects to be duly compensated .
johnny sack sure as shit ain &apos;t gonna perform .
who ?
mr. cinelli &apos;s waste management
consultant . and since johnny sack ain &apos;t gonna step up ,
guess what ? it &apos;s coming out of your ass .
you know , i &apos;m starting to feel a little intimidated .
as well you should , my friend .
a man who teaches skiing for a living
ought to look after his physical condition ,
wouldn &apos;t you say ? his knees .
kid , you wouldn &apos;t be in this situation
if you &apos;d listened to tony in the first place .
he &apos;s looking out for you . he doesn &apos;t wanna see you get hurt .
i got a lot on my mind these days .
i don &apos;t need this shit .
jason , we shook hands . a deal &apos;s a deal .
there &apos;s lifetime employees who expect compensation .
it &apos;s only equitable . now if you &apos;re willing to take care of that ,
maybe we could still work things out .
tony soprano , right ?
fuck that and fuck him . he &apos;s your problem .
look , the numbers just don &apos;t work . - jason !
i &apos;m going to the buffet table . be right there , mom .
if i give tony what he wants , i lose money on the sale .
i can &apos;t do that to my mom .
kid , you work it out any way you want ,
but nobody &apos;s backing out of the deal . - mr. cinelli , i &apos;m sorry ,
but the bottom line is i &apos;m not selling
the company to you .
there are other buyers out there . tony was quite clear about that .
i &apos;ll tell you the fuckin &apos; bottom line , laddy buck .
the barone routes are now cinelli routes .
that &apos;s that .
t.
horrible thing . they brought this little girl in ,
she &apos;s got third @-@ degree burns on 80 % of her body .
you wouldn &apos;t believe the week i &apos;ve had .
what ?
there &apos;s a little girl burned in there .
jesus christ .
sorry , t.
no . now what the fuck is with you ?
and i want some answers , &apos; cause you &apos;re starting to drive me fuckin &apos; nuts .
this remains between us ?
&apos;course .
my aunt who died--
she wasn &apos;t my aunt .
she was my mother .
what ? your aunt , the nun ...
was your mother ?
some cocksucker g. i. knocked her up during the war .
russ .
so what was your mother ?
my ma &apos;s my aunt .
she adopted me to hide the family shame .
believe this shit ?
all i did for her .
not only is my ma not my ma ,
who the fuck even knows who this russ bastard is ?
worst thing , i &apos;m not who i am .
it &apos;s like my whole life is a joke ,
a big fuckin &apos; joke on me .
can i come with you every day ?
you gotta go back to school .
this is just for the vacation . stay here .
this ain &apos;t your route no more . it &apos;s ours . cinelli . what do you mean ?
i have this route for five years .
stupid fuck .
fuck this .
papi !
papi !
papi ! papi !
papi !

go to bed , eat nothing but gallons of ice cream , tons of pizza ...
who &apos;s there ?
oh , hi paulie .
you didn &apos;t go to your mother &apos;s funeral . it &apos;s a sin .
some mother . even a rat don &apos;t abandon its own children .
no , you should feel sorry for her .
she &apos;s gonna have to face st. peter
with this stain on her .
i hope she rots in hell !
don &apos;t say that !
and you . i was your meal ticket ,
the goose with the golden eggs !
look at this place . who set you up here ?
not that fuckin &apos; brother of mine or rose .
they never provided you with shit !
well , your real children can start now .
i went without , so you could have .
the mink coat , the massage chair from sharper &apos;s image ,
the flat @-@ screen tv .
$ 2 , 000 bucks for a woman i don &apos;t even know !
paulie !
paulie , please .
you &apos;re on your own . i never wanna see you again .
i told you . it &apos;s a different corporate culture .
i tried to redefine the deal .
you shouldn &apos;t have made the deal without talking to me in the first place !
well god damn it , how was i supposed to know ?
i made it perfectly clear : give up part of your profits .
thanks to you , a man is beaten half to death .
while his little boy was watching .
and it &apos;s all over the media !
it &apos;s not fair . the business belongs to my family .
&quot; fair &quot; ?
you fuckin &apos; believe this shit ?
you remind me of my kid .
talk to the katrina victims about fair .
talk to paulie here . he &apos;ll tell you about fair !
absolutely .
you &apos;re worse than my son !
get him the fuck outta here !
hey !
how was i supposed to know ? my family kept me in the dark .

you make me sick , you fucking baby .

fleshy part of the thigh , like you said .
there &apos;s only 7 , 000 here . i said eight .
hey , hey , hey , i get my little brother to do it for less , believe that .
trust me , you gotta go outside the family for something like this .
you don &apos;t want people knowing .
that way you can blame it on dr. droop or whoever .
7,000 &apos;s all i got .
okay .
i don &apos;t wanna know when it &apos;s coming . you decide .
get this ...
it says here that if the history of the planet
was represented by the empire state building ,
the time that human beings have been on earth
would only be a postage stamp at the very top .
you realize how insignificant that makes us ?
i don &apos;t feel that way .
hey .
hey .
there he is .
hi , chris .
hesh , how are you ?
great to see you looking so robust .
hey .
how you doing ?
beth wanted to come .
yeah , sure .
hi , tony .
hey .
so how &apos;s eli ?
i hear that with the physical therapy , they got him using a walker .
he &apos;s doing better . thank you .
hey , tony .
okay to visit ?
yeah , yeah , sure .
my nephew christopher , pastor bob .
hesh rabkin , his daughter beth .
hi . - how you feeling ?
physically , a little better than i was .
so maybe you &apos;re right . that prayer business works .
i brought you something .
&quot; born again . &quot;
charles colson .
the watergate guy .
friend of mine did time with him .
a ruthless , powerful man who thought he was above the law .
he committed crimes and then went to prison .
and then he found jesus , and everything changed .
became a different man .
yeah , so ?
salvation isn &apos;t just about
being saved from hell after you die .
it &apos;s also about being saved from yourself while you &apos;re still alive .
i hope when you get out of the hospital
that you &apos;ll join us at the church
of the open door of the redeemer .
well it must be nice
to have something to hold onto .
maybe .
hmm .
what ?
dinosaurs . my kids can &apos;t get enough .
yeah , yeah , me too .
every since i saw king kong kick their ass in the original .
my son loves dinosaurs too .
that &apos;s interesting .
what ?
some people would have you believe
dinosaurs existed millions of years ago .
it &apos;s just not true .
god created the earth 6 , 000 years ago .
and i tell my kids , you have to remember ,
dinosaurs and human beings lived on the earth at the same time .
what , like &quot; the flintstones &quot; ?
it &apos;s in the bible .
yeah , but what about all that carbon @-@ dating stuff ?
a lot of scientists would disagree with you .
well , i think you &apos;ll find all those people have an agenda , tony--
evolution , which is satan &apos;s plan to deny god .
evolution and salvation are mutually exclusive .
guy next door &apos;s a scientist . think he &apos;d disagree with you big time .
then that man &apos;s not saved .
read about mr. colson . we &apos;ll talk later .
what &apos;s he saying ? there were dinosaurs back with adam and eve ?
i guess .
no way .
t. rex in the garden of eden ?
adam and eve would be running all the time ,
scared shitless . but the bible says it was paradise .
you can disagree with evangelicals ,
but they &apos;re great friends of the jews
because israel is the holy land .
you wait .
hey , how ya doing ?
hi .
i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom .
your color &apos;s better .
so mr. wizard , you were talking about tornados .
you know what the indians say about the wind ?
no .
they say that sometimes
we go around feeling pity for ourselves ,
but behind our back , a great wind is carrying us .
we don &apos;t see we &apos;re part of a much bigger reality .
then we die .
why are you so interested in all this ?
i was in this coma and , uh ...
look , i don &apos;t remember nothing ,
but before i woke up ,
i felt like i was being pulled towards something .
and i don &apos;t wanna go back .
and my wife told me i woke up at one point and said ...
&quot; who am i ?
where am i going ? &quot;
kinda makes you wonder ,
about heaven and hell .
that presupposes a duality of good and evil .
you know it gets us back to the idea
of separate , opposing entities .
you know where i go with that .
but this bible guy i know says you &apos;re going to hell .
maybe he &apos;s right .
got my test results back .
laryngeal cancer .
jesus , i &apos;m sorry .
you know i was thinking , maybe you could do me a favor
and , uh , you know what &apos;s the term ,
&quot; whack &quot; me ?
sorry , bad joke .
walking alone again .
what , i &apos;m gonna wait for vito ?
hour and a half to take a dump , that guy .
could build a jetty with what comes out .
little paulie tells me you didn &apos;t go to your aunt &apos;s funeral .
and i &apos;ll tell you something else--
i &apos;m done with nucci .
four gs a month for that nursing home ? fuck that .
what are you gonna do , throw her out on the street ?
way i see it ,

what the fuck , paulie ?
that woman loved you . she fed you .
how many times she bail you out of the can when you were a kid ?
huh ? am i right ?
i &apos;ll tell ya what really fries me--
it &apos;s not nucci . it &apos;s dottie .
i know to your way of thinking , you didn &apos;t have a great mother--
ho !
all i &apos;m saying ,
livia , with all her faults , never abandoned you .
for christ &apos;s sake , paulie . you know what your problem is ?
you go around in pity for yourself .
you think you got it bad .
you &apos;re not stuck in some hospital room
with fucking tubes coming out of you .
you can eat food like a normal person .
t , i never meant to trivialize your situation .
well , you gotta get beyond this petty bullshit , paulie .
you &apos;re part of something bigger .
when you gonna learn that ?
my ass !
marvin ? !
ow ! they shot me in my ass !
they shot me in my ass !

i can only imagine how upset you must be .
well it is a very unfortunate situation .
jason just doesn &apos;t understand how the business works .
that &apos;s for sure .
no , it &apos;s not his fault .
it &apos;s my fault . dick and i purposely kept him in the dark .
blame me , not him .
you &apos;re not involved in this , helen .
i was too wrapped up
in my own grief . i didn &apos;t realize ...
