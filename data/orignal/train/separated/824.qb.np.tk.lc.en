okay , schmidt , you ready for your feedback for the week ?
yes . uh , let me just pull up my performance grid .
first off , thanks for keeping sex quick .
you were like a dog with an ice cream cone ,
and i loved it , but screaming
&quot; that &apos;s how schmidty do &quot; was not ideal .
even though that &apos;s how sch @-@ schmidty did ?
well , schmidty did , and he did it good ,
but mommy doesn &apos;t want to hear
how schmidty &apos;s doing .
note ... note taken .
okay . great . good .
note taken .
i feel like i &apos;m watching a porn set in an hr department .
you know , fawn is teaching me how to be the most effective
and successful man and lover i possibly can be .
really ? i thought you were fine before .
when you two were together ? which time ?
the ... the first time or the third time ?
because ... &apos; cause you two
were very off @-@ and @-@ on .
in a ... in a very confusing way .
i &apos;ve had sex with him so many times .
we have a fun thing together , don &apos;t we ?
super fun , yeah . i really enjoy it .
what is her ... what is it , cecil ?
what is your name ?
you &apos;ll learn it . don &apos;t worry .
fawn &apos;s helping me see that i haven &apos;t reached
my full potential yet .
well , obviously , none of you have .
no , i have . i &apos;m a cop .
and , as of yesterday , my mom no longer buys
my plane tickets , so ...
you need a ten @-@ year plan .
are you in a relationship that &apos;s headed towards marriage ?
i am not currently , but i did go on a date
with somebody named charles last month .
she was a woman , but she was named after her uncle .
well , winston has no game .
dude took a girl to a cement plant .
to see how rocks were made .
that &apos;s not where rocks are made .
and she loved it , then she abruptly moved away .
work sucked , my friends .
hear ye , hear ye .
milady .
i dub you sir winston of the roll of egg .
ah , yes . yes .
who are you in this story ?
i &apos;m the jester .
i &apos;m not gonna eat here anymore .
you &apos;d think that the school board would want
to give kids computers , but no ,
they just want to get reelected
so they can keep dressing
like realtors from the 1980s .
solid municipal burn , jessica .
fawn ...
councilwoman .
councilwoman-- do you think
you could help me get some traction with these people ?
oh , funnily enough , i have a charity event tomorrow
with other high @-@ powered l.a. women .
i &apos;ll put a word in with yowtz .
martha yowtz ?
yeah .
the lioness of los angeles education ?
yes .
the straw that stirs the school board &apos;s drink ?
that &apos;s right .
that is a woman i &apos;d like to get to know .
is there any way i could come with you to this event ?
ah , you know , it &apos;s really a networking thing .
well , that &apos;s perfect , &apos; cause i &apos;d love to network her .
with her . it &apos;s &quot; with ... &quot;
you network with her .
yeah , it &apos;s &quot; network with her , &quot;
and you don &apos;t really strike me
as the &quot; networking &quot; type .
you &apos;re more of a &quot; follow a butterfly around
for a day &quot; kind of gal .
oh , sister , i &apos;m a middle @-@ school vice principal .
you think i got this job without knowing how to network ?
most likely . yes .
i got an office with a door , bub .
pencil me in . i &apos;ll yak with yowtz .
the press will be there ,
and i could use a photo with an educator , so ... okay .
oh , great .
do you still need me for the photo op ?
i will need you there , actually .
i &apos;m trying to become more accessible on social media .
speaking of which , is there some way you can
make your skin look less white in photos ?
people are saying that you &apos;re haunting me .
i can do that . absolutely . 100 % .
let me just make a note .
wonderful .
and , jess , the event tomorrow is at a golf course .
do you golf ?
does a bear eat with his hands ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll be there .
great .
so i say to her , &quot; water ? i barely even know you . &quot;
stop talking to me like we &apos;re in the middle of a conversation .
we just sat down .
all right .
i hate when you do that .
okay .
winston .
that is a beautiful girl right there .
just say something to her .
yeah , just say something to her .
shawty , what that thang do ?
no .
what was that ?
dude , i think it &apos;s
a nervous tic that stems from my lack of self @-@ confidence .
we got to help . i can &apos;t watch this .
excuse me , miss ? hi .
coach , stop .
um , this is my buddy , winston .
um ... i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s doing with his mouth .
that &apos;s not his normal smile at all .
i &apos;m gonna fix that . if i could just ...
both sides-- even it out . better .
i think he likes you .
oh , yeah ?
just go talk to her . you got it .
i don &apos;t ...
okay , okay , i &apos;m going .
you got it . you got it . he &apos;s coming .
he &apos;s excited to talk to you .
hey ... my friends .
hello .
i &apos;m winston bishop .
winston bishop . kc .
kc ! just be like , &quot; yo , kc , where jojo at ? &quot;
in rehab , probably .
he &apos;s ... he was on drugs .
yeah .
sorry . um ...

uh , kind of blowing this , huh ?
um , i think you &apos;re very beautiful , kc ,
and i would like to see you again soon ...

i &apos;d love to .

i &apos;m gonna put in my number ...
or come with me to this thing in the park
i &apos;m going to now
and we can grab something after .
you know , i saw nick nolte in the park once .
and i was like , &quot; yo , nick nolte , what you doing in the park ? &quot;
and he was just like , &quot; i &apos;m just hanging out . &quot;
yeah , so i thought that was notable .
i &apos;m going to a rally to protest the police .
do you want to come ?
or we could just do lunch .
let &apos;s do lunch .
okay .
nice to ... nice to meet you , kc .
fawn is none of my business ,
and schmidt seems to really like her ,
so whatever happens , i &apos;m just not getting involved .
then why are you on your way to hang out with him ?
what are you doing ?
he said to come over .
he said it was an emergency .
what if he does something sexy ?
that &apos;s like gollum
hanging out with the one ring .
it &apos;ll be fine .
ooh . hey , cece , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
i need you to put bronzer all over my body .
none of the guys are here , and they also refused to do it .
um , all over . i know you &apos;re giving me a look ,
but , really , like , all over .
all the cracks , the crevices .
the engine , the caboose , everything .
oh , okay .
gripped it and ripped it .
you da man .
no , say , &quot; fawn &apos;s the man . &quot;
fawn &apos;s the man .
fawn &apos;s the man .
oh , hey , there &apos;s yowtz .
woman &apos;s got more connections than a flight
from burbank to sri lanka .
well , then , it &apos;s a good thing
i bought the airport neck pillow
in the gift shop , because ...
you know what that means .
i got this .
okay .
how the hell are you ?
jessica day .
i need 20 computers for my school .
just met you , but noted .
you &apos;re up .
thanks .
what ? oh .
you walk towards the ...
whoops .
oh , dear lord .
why are we putting this on your body ?
aren &apos;t you gonna be wearing a shirt ?
well , you know , fawn wants me
to be prepared for all scenarios .
what if somebody gives birth out there
and i have to swaddle the baby in my polo ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve never been under this kind of scrutiny before .
i &apos;m having my teeth shaved by
a 25th of an inch .
fawn thinks that i have the teeth of an immigrant .
she says every time she looks at me ,
all she can see is fievel mouskewitz
singing &quot; there are no cats in america . &quot;
those little ...
those little mice jews .
i mean , what do you think , cece ?
you ... you like fawn , right ?
yeah , i mean , as @-@ as long as you &apos;re happy .
there you go .
what the hell ?
what ?
why am i sparkly ?
sparkly ?
you bought the bronzer with glitter in it .
cece , please , you gotta help me , ce ...
fawn &apos;s gonna kill me !
okay , just don &apos;t get too expressive . you &apos;ll crease !
so stupid ! i feel like i &apos;m trying to get into
an 18 @-@ and @-@ under club in tucson !
so , yeah , at the rally , there was this kid
i know from the youth center
who was arrested last week
because he &quot; fit a description . &quot;
i mean , he &apos;s 14-- he doesn &apos;t even fit into his jeans .
yeah .
anyways ...
enough about me . let &apos;s , uh , talk about you .
what do you do ?
what do i do ?
um ... okay .
well ... what do i do ?
okay , the truth is ...
hey , man .
you know them ?
oh , not personally , no .
hey , what &apos;s up , bishop ?
oh , yeah , i do know them .
we went to school together .
see you at work , bud .
more importantly ...
we work together .
you &apos;re a cop ?
me ?
a cop ? no !
no , no , no , no , no , no . don &apos;t ...
no , no , no . get that out of your head .
uh , what i do is i &apos;m a ...
male stripper .
a stripper ?
that &apos;s why they were wearing the uniforms .
yeah , i see where you ... why you would think that . no .
a surprising amount of day work for a stripper .
you know , we just go in there , we do our routine
while they eat their lunch salads .
you just pray nobody orders soup .
lost a lot of good men to soup .
it &apos;s hard to gauge temperature
when you &apos;re just ... dipping and running .
you &apos;d be surprised what you could replace a ladle with .
nice day .
beautiful .
what happened to the top of my hat ?
you take it ?
a little , uh ...
little visor humor .
give me back my hat !
i &apos;m kidding .
i wasn &apos;t gonna hit you .
i &apos;m just joshing .
just joshua , joshua , joshing ...
do you ladies want to join my network ?
uh , you ladies can just go ahead and play through .
yeah . i &apos;ll catch up with you later .
uh , so , how @-@ how do you feel that the networking is going ?
pretty good .
i would call it , like , a solid b.
it &apos;s a cruise ship disaster .
look , jess , if you want those computers ,
we have a lot of work to do and not a lot of time to do it .
shake my hand .
gross .
what is your name ?
jess ?
you have the confidence of a child
that was raised in a basement .
say it with pride , and include your job title
like it &apos;s the second half of your name .
like this-- fawn moscato , city council .
jessica day , vice principal !
how the heck are you ?
lighten it up with a quick joke whenever possible .
nice shoes .
look like you chopped off big bird &apos;s feet ,
you murderer .
and try not to make jokes about murdering
sesame street puppets if you can .
good note .
now , tell me--
are you wearing underwear ?
oh , yeah . big @-@ time .
lose them . i never wear underwear in networking scenarios .
gives you a secret ; an edge .
besides , i firmly believe that power emanates from the vagina .
so , why block it ?
it &apos;s not the only thing that emanates .
what does that mean ?
other stuff .
so i said , &quot; tammy , are we playing golf ,
or are we making sand castles ? &quot;
tammy is the worst .
she told my kid to shut up once . i nearly punched her .
i don &apos;t want to start talking business while we still
have a whole tournament to play , but ...
i &apos;d love to connect about your ideas in the clubhouse .
let &apos;s meet up there when we &apos;re all done .
great . i &apos;ll see you in there , marty .
may i call you marty ?
oh , i &apos;d prefer it .
the clubhouse ?
that is where you close the deal .
you are in , my friend .
now , let &apos;s finish up this game .
no problem .
write a six and let &apos;s go .
they should start putting gps in golf balls , am i right ?
we already got lapped by sue kim from the korean women &apos;s league ,
and she &apos;s 100 .
jess , she is literally 100 years old .
and i &apos;m ... i &apos;ll tell you what-- not a young 100 .
martha doesn &apos;t strike me as the type of person
who gives computers to cheaters .
you really don &apos;t understand how networking works .
the computers are just the thing you talk about
when you &apos;re really talking about
how to help each other become more powerful .
just like the money for this golf thing--
it doesn &apos;t go to charity .
it just pays for the event where we network .
isn &apos;t that cool ?
yay , america !
were the computers ever really on the table ?
you &apos;re still talking about the computers ?
okay . uh , no . no . no money for computers .
i should &apos;ve never listened to you .
i also should have never removed my underwear ,
because now it &apos;s drafty and i feel vulnerable to wildlife .
are your underwear sticking out of your pocket ?
are those boys &apos; underwear ?
they &apos;re unisex . none of your business .
look , will you forget the ball ?
or none of these women are ever going to
invite you to play golf again .
well , i don &apos;t want to play golf with these women again .
i don &apos;t want any part of this .
if i can &apos;t have the computers ,
i will ... i will stay here
and i will play a clean game of golf .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , fawn , i need to go find my ball .
like an honest person .
okay .
oh , look-- it &apos;s a baby bird .
no , it &apos;s a dead baby bird .
i need to move on before i get emotional .
can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t tell her i was a cop .
with everything that &apos;s been going on , i just ...
i feel like she wouldn &apos;t respect me .
you want to know what i think ?
no , nick , i don &apos;t .
this is something you can &apos;t understand .
because i &apos;m not black ? uh ...
what , because i don &apos;t work for nasa ,
i can &apos;t fix a rocket ship ?
if you don &apos;t work at nasa , they &apos;re not gonna
just let you walk off the street and fix a rocket ship .
you &apos;re missing my point .
besides , you lost your right to talk to me
about race during the o.j. trial .
... is in the white bronco ...
why does it have to be a &quot; white &quot; bronco ?
why not just a bronco ?
i can talk to you about this .
i mean , we grew up together .
we went to the same schools , we watched the same shows ,
we listened to the same records .
your mother got a mouth on the back of her neck ,
and bitch chew like this .
hercules .
was that your eddie murphy ?
that &apos;s eddie murphy .
that was so bad , it wasn &apos;t even offensive .
i said &quot; hercules , &quot; and everyone
associates that with eddie murphy .
whenever you do your impressions ,
it makes me super uncomfortable .
fine . you know what ? you want to do this ?
you and me are gonna get weird about race ?
do your seinfeld . come ... nick , that &apos;s not ...
do your seinfeld .
what &apos;s the deal with bananas ?
i mean , they got orange juice ,
you got apple juice , where &apos;s the banana juice ?
i never thought of that .
ah , boy .
&apos;cause you got orange juice , you ...
i love you , but you &apos;re white , i &apos;m black .
i understand where she &apos;s coming from .
when i was a kid , we used to run from the police .
even if we did nothing wrong , it was just out of habit .
why haven &apos;t you ever told me ?
&apos;cause you &apos;ll never get it .
how long have you been standing there ?
uh , right around , &quot; your mama got a mouth on the back
of her neck , and the bitch chew like this . &quot;
now , that &apos;s eddie !
i don &apos;t see the difference .
hercules ! hercules ! hercules !
he &apos;s doing the laugh !
that &apos;s what i was doing .
stop , nick .
i honestly don &apos;t see the difference .
as the only other black man in this loft ,
i feel like i should weigh in .
this issue really hits home with me ,
and i feel like i have a lot of thoughts
and ideas that i need to get off my chest .
thank you , coach .
but i &apos;m hungry .
man . i skipped breakfast ,
and lunch is gonna be dumb as hell .
race talk snacks
race talk snacks , gotta get me
some race talk snacks
gonna be super uncomfortable !
so , kc ... shh ...
i just feel like ...
can &apos;t @-@ can &apos;t weigh in .
i know , but i ...
can &apos;t weigh in .
i do have something i want to say that &apos;s not a race ...
shh , don &apos;t .
i know what i &apos;m gonna do .
i &apos;m gonna tell her the truth .
i &apos;m a good guy ; that &apos;s all that matters .
that &apos;s what i was gonna say . i want to make this ...
no , no , no .
shut it down , nick .
your mother got a mouth
on the back of her neck , and she chews like this .
murphy , murphy , murphy .
so the good news is you can &apos;t see
the glitter anymore .
great .
well , what &apos;s the bad news ?
you look like ,
um ... can &apos;t exactly put my finger on it .
i look like the dead body the police pull out of a lake .
that &apos;s how you describe it ; you look dead .
i don &apos;t want to look like a dead boy .
i want to look like a living boy .
why are you calling yourself a boy ?
because i &apos;m freaking out !
freaking ...
freaking out . oh , no .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s fawn .
hey , faw ... hey , fawn .
what the jewish god did you do ?
in an attempt to look less ghost @-@ like ,
i put on some bronzer , but the bronzer
had glitter in it , and now ...
you look like a wood carving of yourself .
the press is here .
and single women have proven to be less appealing to voters .
fix it and get here now .
i am fawn moscato , and i will not miss a photo opportunity !
faw ... oh . fawn ?
how about a fake beard ?
get some double @-@ sided tape ,
we can shave winston &apos;s cat ...
okay , you know what , enough .
i cannot just stand here and watch fawn
treat you like she &apos;s your pageant mom .
she needs to accept you exactly how you are ,
or you need to find somebody that will .
&apos;cause i think you are fine as is .
damn it .
you know what , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m gonna go talk to her .
can you drive though ? i want to fix my makeup in the car .
for me , not for her .
i don &apos;t want to scare anybody . ugh .
i think i &apos;m drunk from the face fumes .
i &apos;ve never seen so many strokes taken
on a single hole in all of my life .
this has got to be some kind of record .
do you care to comment ?
not bad ! look at her go !
the hole &apos;s behind you .
thanks , marty .
172 !
par was five .
i know , marty .
you &apos;re the worst golfer i &apos;ve ever seen .
look , i don &apos;t care if i look stupid .
i didn &apos;t come here to climb the ladder .
the only reason why i came here
was to get computers for my students .
and that &apos;s the only reason why i came : for the school .
i respect that .
i &apos;ll get you those computers .
really ? !
yes , i will .
in 2018 , when the district is fiscally solvent .
i &apos;ll ... take that as a victory .
i support vice principal day .
it is education
that will bring water back to this city
and will rebuild the middle class ...
don &apos;t let me back down .
don &apos;t worry , i will not .
you look ... so crazy right now .
you look like a doll boy .
a doll man .
i &apos;m a d ... i &apos;m a doll man .
a doll man who &apos;s about to get his dignity back .
let &apos;s beat china !
i &apos;m fawn moscato !
i can &apos;t believe it .
now , this ball is a symbol ...
of the unity ...
oh , no , no , no , no , no , no !
fawn , fawn , fawn , fawn , fawn , fawn , fawn .
what ? what &apos;s going on ?
you &apos;re not wearing any , uh ...
each one &apos;s like a snowflake .
what do you mean there &apos;s a meme ?
it speaks ?
well , what does it say ?
oh , well , that is just crass .
yes , i know i wanted a more accessible web pr ...
will you stop laughing , lou ?
you &apos;re a father !
you &apos;re my father !
oh , no , no , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s carpet cleaner .
you know , i thought i &apos;d take it right down to the base .
i &apos;ll probably have to regrow some skin , but it &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s okay , schmidt .
look , i understand if you want to break up with me .
i &apos;m a laughingstock ,
and you shouldn &apos;t be associated with my brand .
which is tainted .
an unfortunate choice of words .
so , what was it you wanted to say to me ?
fawn , i don &apos;t want to break up with you .
i like you just the way that you are .
no offense , but you &apos;re terrifying to look at ,
and you smell like a chemical fire .
taint that the truth ?
yeah .
did you see what i did there ?
i just ...
it was too ... too soon .
&apos;cause you did it , then i ...
it &apos;s too soon .
i wanted you to feel good about when you said it though .
okay .
kc ?
so ...
this is the real me .
i &apos;m proud of what i do , i really am .
i work with a lot of great people ,
and i want to be one of them .
plus , if there are ever ghostbusters ,
i know they &apos;re gonna recruit from law enforcement first .
i know you &apos;re mad at me .
i just came to say that .
i &apos;m not mad that you &apos;re a cop .
i &apos;m mad that you lied .
well , tell you what ,
uh , is there any way i could take you out again
and , you know , uh , be so honest with you
that it scares the hell out of you ?
i don &apos;t know .
that uniform is kind of distracting , isn &apos;t it ?
maybe you should ... take it off .
you lied and said you were a stripper ;
it seems like the fair thing to do .
just in front of all these people ?
in front of your colleagues ?
oh , okay . i hear some &quot; whoos ! &quot;
you ain &apos;t got no ginuwine or nothing ?
seriously though , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m ...
i really am a police officer . it &apos;s ...
i can &apos;t really be here stripping for ... you !
it &apos;s a clip @-@ on , ladies .
and it &apos;s on the ground . here we go .
uh @-@ huh , i want y &apos;all to get y &apos;all ones ready .
i wear my underwear two sizes too big .
this is a ... this is a thing .
this is a thing i got to do in order to get my belt off .
