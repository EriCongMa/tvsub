you went without me .
you wouldn &apos;t get up .
because it was nighttime .
it was 4 : 30 .
yeah . in boston , we call that &quot; nighttime . &quot;
good morning .
how far did you go ?
i went to the , uh , b.u. bridge .
you went 12 miles ? are you supposed to do that ?
sure . why not ? me and my braces have made peace .
can you leave those on ?
they &apos;re so hot .
don &apos;t . i @-@ i &apos;m sweaty .
i love you .
well , i say it to you in my head .
i guess it was time to say it out loud .
that sounds so bizarre when we say it .
so which one of us is gonna say &quot; uncle &quot; ?
yeah , there doesn &apos;t seem to be a way around it , does there ?
one of us has to be a house @-@ spouse .
why is it so complicated ?
don &apos;t stress . they &apos;ve extended my leave .
we have two more weeks to think about it .
really ? !
morning !
everybody decent in there ? !
yes ! perfect timing !
we were hoping to have an orgy ,
and then we realized we were one person short .
ha . hey , maura .
hi . uh , you still want to run to boston joe &apos;s ?
go . i know you hate my army coffee .
i &apos;m sorry .
get out of here .
i &apos;ll see you later .
wait ! bye .
okay , bye .
come on ! get him ! get him !
yes !
oh , shoot !
hey , wait !
oh , no .
hey , there . did you miss your bus ?
hey , my name &apos;s brent .
i work at the three @-@ ring car wash .
i know . silly outfit , right ?
well , uh , come on .
i &apos;m going right past , uh , lower mills elementary school .
is that where you &apos;re headed ?
yeah .
i @-@ i @-@ i can drop you .
t @-@ that &apos;s -- that &apos;s okay . - oh , come on . here .
wait . hey , that &apos;s mine !
hey , hey . what the hell are you doing ?
no ! don &apos;t ! let go of him !
let go of him !
back off !
why don &apos;t you mind your own business ? !
no , i want to know what the hell you think you &apos;re doing .
get off of me !
i &apos;m calling the police .
what do i do ?
indecisiveness is associated with a range
of problematic psychological outcomes ,
including anxiety and depression .
well , if he has to leave the army
or i have to quit my job , i can assure you both of us
are going to be very anxious and depressed .
okay . why can &apos;t we be like them ?
look , they &apos;re so sweet and simple .
oh , morning .
are you helping neda ?
or just flirting ?
flirting . you &apos;re gonna get me in trouble .
two low @-@ fat flat lattes coming up .
thank you .
thank you .
thanks for being so nice to her .
she worries every time she sees you .
why ? because she called me a &quot; bitch &quot; the first time she met me ?
i &apos;ve already forgotten it .
you know what ? in fairness to neda ,
she did think that you threw your hot coffee on a stranger .
see ?
your mom is so great , jane .
how do you know my mom ?
don &apos;t tell me she &apos;s cheating on her espresso machine
and buying her coffee here .
no , i met her at the division one caf ?
angela is letting neda use it
as a model for her master &apos;s thesis .
oh ? what &apos;s your thesis ?
it &apos;s a business plan to turn angela &apos;s drinks and healthy homemade food
into a chain .
maybe ma will make it rich after all .
well , it &apos;s all theoretical .
no , it isn &apos;t .
you &apos;ve been helping her integrate
more vegan recipes into her menu .
what ? no . don &apos;t do that .
coffee party &apos;s over .
frost , will you give us a ride
back to my place so we can change ?
sure thing .
thanks , neda .
thank you .
see you later .
okay , this is a weird one .
well , let &apos;s start with introductions . who &apos;s that ?
abraham reynolds . lived right over there .
he died being a good samaritan .
what happened ?
10 @-@ year @-@ old boy named zack says a man
tried to grab him and force him into a car .
reynolds saw it , jumped in to try to rescue the kid .
he appears to have suffered a subdural hematoma .
did the boy describe the kidnapper ?
he said it was a clown .
what is it ?
in 1988 , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old boy was abducted by a clown
on his way home from school .
nick hamilton .
i &apos;ll never forget it . i was 12 .
ma wouldn &apos;t let us go anywhere for months .
we called it the &quot; summer of the clown . &quot;
i was still in uniform . it was a bad time .
well , what happened to nick ?
never found him -- or the clown .
a random clown kidnapped a kid ?
no . no . no .
there were three attempted kidnappings on young boys
before the clown grabbed nick .
i never liked clowns .
coulrophobia -- fear of clowns .
a recent study has confirmed
that clowns are disliked by most children .
what do we know about this clown ?
said his name was &quot; brent &quot;
and he was headed for his job at a clown car wash .
as far as i know , there are no clown car washes in boston .
frost , can you do a search ?
yeah , sure .
oh , he &apos;s holding something .
satin polyester trim .
yellow . shiny .
looks like something a clown would wear .
no clown motifs on any businesses near here ,
including car washes .
found something .
yeah . looks like a petal , maybe ?
yeah , it &apos;s a piece of a plastic flower .
we might have a footprint here .
yep . clown shoe . big one .
all right , let &apos;s have csru get here
and make a cast impression .
i &apos;m not liking this .
me , either .
tell me our poor , dead samaritan managed to scratch the clown .
i &apos;m not sure i have any skin cells yet ,
but there &apos;s a beige , powdery substance
under his index finger .
we need the killer &apos;s skin , maura .
he had a pre @-@ existing condition .
wait , no ! don &apos;t stop !
we could get lucky and get the killer &apos;s dna .
hold your horses .
homer said that to antilochus
to get him to stop driving his chariot like a maniac .
aha . i had always wondered .
see this ? it &apos;s an aneurysm .
what , it burst when his skull struck the curb ?
yes .
anything on the plastic flower ?
uh , we did a headspace analysis .
i &apos;d like a headspace analysis .
it would help me figure out
if i &apos;m going to marry the love of my life ,
or stay here and solve murders and become an old cat lady .
you &apos;ll never be a cat lady .
you &apos;ll be a dog lady .
are you having lunch with casey ?
wh-- only if you talk faster about the plastic flower .
it has volatile organic chemical levels
close to 1,000 parts per million .
even faster .
the fda hasn &apos;t allowed levels over 500 since 1990 .
wait , since 1990 ...
that means ...
the flower was probably manufactured in the &apos; 80s .
don &apos;t cancel your lunch .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m not . i &apos;m ordering files from the archives .
if the costume our killer was wearing is from the &apos; 80s ,
maybe there &apos;s a connection to that &apos; 88 kidnapping .
jane asked me to bring up all the incident reports .
put them over there .
okay , but you &apos;re gonna need a bigger squad room .
there are hundreds of boxes down there .
do you really want to go through all the incident reports
from june , july , and august of &apos; 88 ?
no . we really want you to go through them all .
look for any reports that mention a clown .
why would the clown be back ?
if you find it boring going through old files ,
maybe martinez has something exciting to do .
yeah , somebody &apos;s got to count all those seized xanax pills .
hey , frankie , did you ever notice how frost
can talk and work at the same time ?
&quot; bats in the attic . &quot;
&quot; lost car keys . &quot;
&quot; my neighbor flashed his butt at me . &quot;
these aren &apos;t sorted .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
did you find the three files on the attempted kidnappings ?
yeah . they &apos;re right there .
i also found the missing @-@ persons files .
ah , i remember that kid .
尼克 · 汉密尔顿
his face was everywhere , even on milk cartons .
yeah , the only witness to nick &apos;s kidnapping
was a housewife who saw it from her kitchen window .
&quot; a housewife &quot; ?
are you gonna tell me the ladies
like to be called &quot; domestic engineers &quot; ?
&quot; the ladies &quot; ?
oh , stop busting my balls .
we got to set up a separate tip line .
i &apos;ll set one up in bric .
yeah , brace yourself . we had
thousands of false clown sightings in &apos; 88 --
teenagers playing pranks , parents flipping out .
didn &apos;t help us find this boy .
oh , the forensic artist just finished with zack .
he was the only witness to the clown .
release it , although i doubt the bad guy
is still wandering around in his clown getup .
this is beautiful .
i never have a real lunch .
last time i was on a picnic ,
i was with my family at franklin park zoo .
and my father insisted on fixing the water fountain
and snapped the pipe .
i hope it was the marine section .
no , it was the elephant section .
what did the elephants do ?
they shot water at us .
i know you , uh -- you hate to be away
when you &apos;re in the middle of a case , so ...
it makes me mad that some poor guy
trying to save a kid got murdered .
let &apos;s not talk work .
it &apos;s okay . i want to support you .
i support what you do .
i want to do the same for you .
casey , i don &apos;t want to be responsible
for ruining your career .
you know , they want you to be a general .
do you know how few people get that opportunity ?
i feel the same way about asking you to be an army wife .
your work &apos;s important , and you &apos;re so good at it .
so , what do we do ?
so , maybe it &apos;s time i resigned my commission .
if anyone was born to be a leader , you are .
i googled you , you know .
so you know about the sex change ?
shut up .
no . i know that you have a purple heart .
i know that you have a distinguished service cross .
and i know how you got those medals .
here . put this on your finger .
i want to see what size you wear .
okay .
all right .
well ... let &apos;s hope you &apos;re a 7 .
how did you know ?
i pay attention .
i always thought i &apos;d know what to say
when the man i loved proposed to me .
but i &apos;m making you wait . it &apos;s not fair .
sure , it is . we haven &apos;t figured it out yet .
just ...
just don &apos;t say anything . just wear it .
see how it feels .
i think my customers are gonna be able to tell
the meatballs aren &apos;t meat .
you can taste the chickpeas .
maybe you can give them an upbeat name ,
like &quot; ciao , italia meatballs . &quot;
you think that &apos;ll fool jane ?
uh , no .
is everything all right ?
no .
you ever get what you &apos;ve wanted ,
and you &apos;re not sure you want it anymore ?
uh , yes , positive @-@ psychology research suggests
we should not only be careful what we wish for
but why we wish for it .
i just got offered the job of a lifetime .
well , that &apos;s wonderful !
in beijing .
oh . that &apos;s ... far .
what does detective frost say ?
i haven &apos;t told him yet .
what do you want to do ?
take the job ...
and stay in boston with barry .
those are mutually exclusive .
i just wish i could have it all .
no one has it all .
do you ... regret your choices ?
i mean , you &apos;re a , you know , respected professional .
you made it .
fulfilling your dreams requires a lot of hard choices .
you know , pain over a breakup will fade ,
but you need to ask whether putting him before yourself
is something that you will regret .
did you find anyone who wears a size @-@ 25 clown shoe ?
uh , no , but i did find skin cells
under the victim &apos;s fingernails .
looks like enough to give us a dna profile of his attacker .
what about the beige , powdery stuff ?
uh , we ran it through the gas spectrometer .
it &apos;s paint .
paint ? what , like clown face paint ?
uh , no , like flexible latex paint .
it &apos;s a mixture of rubber cement , pigment , and naphtha .
what &apos;s naphtha ?
highly volatile mixture of hydrocarbons .
you gonna mention that diamond you &apos;re wearing ,
or do i ignore it ?
you don &apos;t watch many romantic comedies , do you ?
i do not .
well , i &apos;m supposed to get all giggly and girly
and you &apos;re supposed to squeal .
why would i squeal over
a colorless , crystalline form of pure carbon ?
you have to admit it &apos;s pretty .
i just wanted to wear it for a couple minutes .
i don &apos;t want to think about what it means . i just ...
talk to me about the paint !
it was used on a slush @-@ molded latex mask .
okay , so , our good samaritan
must have grabbed the killer by his rubber clown mask .
can you trace the manufacturer ?
lab techs are already working on it .
so ... you &apos;re leaving ?
what ? no . no .
i didn &apos;t say &quot; yes . &quot;
can you see yourself as a general &apos;s wife ?
i mean --
what if i leave behind my life here
and we don &apos;t work out as a couple ?
or he leaves his ?
one of us has to ruin a career for us to be together .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s not fair .
well , if life were fair ,
all 7 billion of us would have one shoe
and a piece of cardboard to call &quot; home . &quot;
how are you gonna survive with one shoe ?
how will i survive without my best friend ?
maura .
wait ! what are you doing ?
i think i have a foreign body on my cornea .
wait . maura ...
no . no . i &apos;m okay .
dr. isles . why would you do that ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry , detective . do what ?
encourage my girlfriend to move to china .
i wasn &apos;t encouraging her .
i was simply being a sounding board .
really ? &quot; the pain over a breakup will fade .
the regret that you put him before yourself won &apos;t . &quot;
i &apos;m so sorry . i --
but that is out of context . i @-@ i didn &apos;t --
she &apos;s leaving on friday , thanks to you .
this isn &apos;t too bad .
no . shouldn &apos;t take us more than a couple of years .
what is this pile ?
213 clown sightings .
we got hobo clowns , fast @-@ food clowns ,
mimes , evil clowns , bozo the clown .
i must have taken a few hundred of those myself .
i can &apos;t believe all we have to go on
are 25 @-@ year @-@ old incident reports .
what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing .
doesn &apos;t look like nothing .
sergeant korsak .
yeah , where ?
okay .
kid was abducted by a clown fitting our description .
grab jane . let &apos;s go .
did you see what happened ?
no , no -- i was making a delivery ,
and i pulled over as soon as i saw this backpack
in the middle of the street .
we &apos;ll need to take that .
the boy must have dropped it .
please tell us everything you saw .
i @-@ it happened so fast .
all i saw was the clown driving away with a little boy .
can you describe the car ?
uh ... g @-@ grey , maybe , o @-@ or silver ?
a sedan ? compact ? station wagon ?
sedan , i think .
did you get a good look at the boy ?
not really . he looked so frightened .
i &apos;m looking for my son .
he should be home . his bus stop is right here .
that &apos;s my son &apos;s .
that &apos;s kevin &apos;s !
okay , okay , um , do you have any pictures of your son ?
they &apos;re -- they &apos;re -- they &apos;re in my house .
okay . w @-@ why don &apos;t we go to your house and get them , okay ?
okay . okay .
i just -- i @-@ i have to call my husband first .
we failed that kid .
no , we didn &apos;t .
yes , we did .
we didn &apos;t catch the clown , and now he has her little boy .
jane .
what ? !
i &apos;m on a picnic with my boyfriend
while the killer &apos;s out looking for his next victim .
i have something . we &apos;ve identified
the manufacturer of the mask through the paint formula .
it was made by every mask , inc . ,
and they went out of business in 1989 .
i &apos;ll start making calls ,
see if i can track down someone who might have records .
something just came in on the tip line .
what do you have ?
a text with a video link came in on the tip line .
texted by phone ?
yeah
did you track the phone ?
no go . it was sent from a burn phone .
bet you didn &apos;t think you &apos;d see me again , did you ?
oh , my god .
that &apos;s a taunt .
say hello to kevin .
tell me that he &apos;s breathing , maura .
tell me that child is alive .
i @-@ i can &apos;t tell , jane .
we got to find that boy .
frost , let &apos;s go through every piece of video
that he sent us frame by frame .
play it from the beginning .
jane ? sorry .
can i talk to you ?
i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t right now .
i @-@ it &apos;ll have to wait . i &apos;m sorry .
it can &apos;t .
okay , um , jut give me two seconds .
i &apos;ll meet you downstairs .
okay , uh , start with the section
where he moves the camera .
jane , we can go through this .
we &apos;ll call if there &apos;s anything .
go
hey . i &apos;m so sorry . i know you &apos;re busy .
no , no . i &apos;m sorry , too . i just -- i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
my leave &apos;s been canceled .
what ?
i &apos;ve got emergency orders to return .
i &apos;m catching a plane now .
you have to ?
yeah .
okay , uh ...
well , i @-@ i @-@ i wish i could take you to the airport ,
but we have a missing kid .
oh , it &apos;s okay . i mean it .
no , it &apos;s not .
what do -- what do we do ?
i don &apos;t know . do you ?
still on hold with city hall .
do they know it &apos;s an emergency ?
that &apos;s why they haven &apos;t hung up .
they &apos;re going through about a decade &apos;s worth
of business records .
yeah , yeah . still here .
detective frost , could you continue
playing the video in slow motion ?
uh @-@ huh . great . thanks .
a guy named buzz wallace owned every mask , inc .
let &apos;s hope buzz is still alive and he kept good records .
hey , freeze it there .
is that a window ?
i can enhance the image .
do it . that &apos;s a window .
are those houses across the street ?
yes . there &apos;s a weather vane .
let &apos;s see which way the arrow on it &apos;s pointing .
i &apos;ll check the wind direction for this morning .
north by northeast .
so , the arrow is pointing north @-@ ish .
which means you &apos;re looking for a house
on the east side of a street that runs north to south .
thank you , magellan .
okay .
good news / bad news .
he did manufacture those masks , but he sold thousands of &apos; em .
sergeant , didn &apos;t the boy , zack ,
say the clown was headed to a clown car wash ?
perhaps there was a car wash in that time
that had some kind of a sales stunt ?
i &apos;ll see if buzz sold any clown masks
to a car wash in the 1980s .
got something -- a fire @-@ alarm box
on the telephone pole across the street from the basement .
the first number is worn off .
that would identify the district .
there are 1,200 of those all over the city .
oh ! oh , good thing buzz is retired .
guy is always online .
yep -- he says he shipped a dozen clown masks
to three @-@ ring car wash in 1988 .
searching for a three @-@ ring car wash .
three @-@ ring car wash . it was owned by william miller .
it closed in 2007 .
got a home address ?
2141 lincoln avenue .
looks like william miller died six months ago .
the house is in probate .
miller left the house to his son , brent .
the clown told zack his name was brent .
i &apos;ll retire from the army . i &apos;ll come back to boston .
jane !
and you &apos;ll hate it . and you &apos;ll hate me .
and ... and i have to go .
me , too .
bye .
we got a possible address on the house .
we have units on the way .
okay , well , let &apos;s pray that boy &apos;s still alive .
no .
no , no , no , no , no . no . kevin ?
mommy ?
no , sweetie . listen to me , okay ?
you &apos;re safe . i &apos;m a police officer .
we &apos;re gonna take you home , okay ?
okay . get him out of here .
contact wound .
put the gun right to his own head .
saved us a whole lot of trouble .
looks like he was doing construction .
probably planned to sell the family home
once it cleared probate .
there &apos;s an area of tattooing and scorched skin
around the perimeter of the wound .
blowback on the right @-@ hand glove .
it &apos;s likely a suicide .
i &apos;ve got a box of clown costumes here .
let &apos;s get them in for processing .
brent miller was in boston in &apos; 88 .
he and his father are pretty good suspects
in the disappearance of that boy , nick hamilton .
all right , let &apos;s get the cadaver dogs
and the ground @-@ penetrating radar here .
search the property for his body .
there &apos;s no telling how many crimes this guy committed .
&quot; it will all be okay . &quot;
yeah , sure it will .
jane ?
i &apos;m terrible company .
so am i. i didn &apos;t come by to talk .
where &apos;s your ring ?
huh ? oh , it &apos;s -- safe deposit box .
maura , this is talking .
i &apos;ll stop . and angong won &apos;t talk , either .
oh , good . you brought angong .
who is angong ?
tang koon tee nan .
i thought you could use a thai massage .
ohh , you are so weird and wonderful .
and if we move your coffee table ,
lawan could give me one , too .
god , no wonder frost is mad at you .
i &apos;m sorry .
well , tell him , not me .
no , i &apos;m apologizing to you , too .
for what , maura ?
this isn &apos;t very relaxing , by the way .
i think i was really talking to you
when i told neda to follow her own path .
so you think casey should be the one to give up everything ?
well , i like the idea of that
better than the idea of you on an army base ,
serving mint juleps to casey &apos;s officers .
don &apos;t worry .
really ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure they all drink beer .
angong , hit her !
it &apos;s yours .
what do you say ?
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome . how &apos;s your arm feeling ?
okay .
kind of wish you guys had better band @-@ aids .
really ? okay .
i &apos;ll look into that . what , like -- like spider @-@ man ?
you ever seen the bacon @-@ shaped ones ?
bacon ? okay .
that sounds cool . okay .
kev , can you tell me what happened yesterday ?
it &apos;s okay . honey , you &apos;re not in trouble .
you should tell detective rizzoli everything , okay ?
the clown said he had a puppy .
he said if i guessed how big his feet were ,
he &apos;d give me the puppy .
is that why you got in the car ?
yeah .
oh , my god .
but you threw your backpack out the window , though , didn &apos;t you ?
yeah ...
yeah .
... when i knew something bad was gonna happen .
that was really , really smart .
excuse me .
be right back .
i ran a tox screen , looking for sedatives .
kevin tested positive for valium .
okay , thanks .
did the clown give you anything to eat or drink ?
yeah . he gave me some milk and some cookies .
is that why he doesn &apos;t remember anything ?
was there something in the milk ?
there was valium .
hey . thank you very much .
thanks for finding me .
is it okay if i get a hug ?
yeah .
okay .
good . come here .
you did great .
okay .
pack up , then . thanks .
damn it .
ground @-@ penetrating radar team didn &apos;t find remains ?
searched every inch of brent miller &apos;s place .
nothing .
i &apos;ve been digging into his background .
he worked at his father &apos;s car wash
while he got his teaching credential ,
left boston in august of &apos; 88
to take a teaching job in philadelphia .
that would have been after nick hamilton &apos;s disappearance .
any missing kids or clown sightings in philly ?
nope .
miller didn &apos;t even have parking tickets .
where did he go for 25 years ?
flea @-@ hopping from school to school ,
up and down the east coast .
they chased him out .
i made calls to the schools where he worked .
nobody would talk .
once he was a teacher , he didn &apos;t need a clown costume .
he had access to all the boys he wanted .
they put him on indefinite paid leave at his last job .
molestation &apos;s hard to prove .
most boys don &apos;t want to testify .
i &apos;m not sure i would .
what &apos;s going on between you and dr. isles ?
nothing .
you &apos;re a bad liar , frost .
the crime lab compared the footprint we found
at the first kidnapping scene yesterday
to the clown shoe that brent was wearing .
they match .
makes sense .
brent tried to grab zack ,
and then killed reynolds when he tried to stop him .
i don &apos;t think it was brent miller .
what ?
miller weighed 225 pounds .
and whoever made this impression weighed less than 175 pounds .
so , two different men wore the shoes ?
we got two clowns ?
it &apos;s the only explanation .
so , who killed reynolds ?
got a toxicology report back ,
and miller had valium in his system .
you found valium in miller and the boy ?
that &apos;s odd .
and both had enough to render them unconscious .
then how did brent kill himself ?
i don &apos;t think he could have .
did you see anything on his body
to indicate he might have been tied up ?
no . no ligature marks .
the only thing i noticed ...
this .
what &apos;s that from ?
contact dermatitis .
wait .
wait , that could be from ...
from what ? what are you looking for ?
this .
he could have been bound to the chair
that we found him in with ace bandages .
that would explain the patch of dermatitis .
that &apos;s a pretty effective restraint .
it wouldn &apos;t have left any traces if it hadn &apos;t touched his skin
where he was perspiring .
so , this is miller with kevin .
but we know it wasn &apos;t miller who tried to grab zack
because of the footprint evidence .
seems like someone wants us to think the clown is back .
somebody framed brent miller .
it makes sense to frame him for a current kidnapping
if he got away with nick hamilton &apos;s kidnapping in &apos; 88 .
wait a minute .
what if miller molested other boys 25 years ago ?
he left boston , comes back .
what if a grown @-@ up victim saw him
and decided it was payback time ?
frankie , can you grab the incident reports ,
the ones of the kids that claimed
they saw that clown in &apos; 88 ?
there aren &apos;t that many .
the three attempted kidnapping victims ,
nick hamilton , and , uh ...
oh , this one .
derrick johnson , 8 .
there &apos;s a note here -- &quot; see additional information . &quot;
well , the detective &apos;s notes are in the archives .
and there &apos;s also a vhs tape
with an interview with the kid -- i can get &apos; em .

德里克 · 约翰逊
derrick says a clown dressed like an american flag
grabbed him at turtle pond
and molested him behind the big rocks .
so , why didn &apos;t detective lewis go forward with the case ?
must have been something wrong with the case .
she was a good cop , really competent .
i got it up .
play it .
now , derrick , why did you wait two weeks
to tell your mom and dad that the clown bothered you ?
i don &apos;t know .
were you afraid you might get in trouble ?
i was scared .
he didn &apos;t want me to tell .
he ? who ? the clown ?
no . i mean , i didn &apos;t want to .
he &apos;s lying . who &apos;s &quot; he &quot; ?
what did the clown do ?
h @-@ he saw us fishing .
&quot; us . &quot; did you hear that ?
he came out of the woods ...
he was with someone .
the clown was in the woods ?
why is the clown in the woods at turtle pond ?
what ? you &apos;re talking .
why were you in the woods ?
i mean i wanted to fish at night .
he said it again ! &quot; we . &quot;
there was no way that kid was out there by himself .
and it got dark , and then i saw a face .
and i got scared .
and the face saw me , and it was the clown .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m going to sleep tonight .
me , either .
derrick johnson would be 33 now .
frost , find out where he is .
when did they pave over the trails at turtle pond ?
oh , so i can talk now ?
1988 .
i only remember &apos; cause i wanted to
ride my bike on the new paths , and ma wouldn &apos;t let me
because there was a crazed clown in boston .
1988 .
we &apos;re onto something .
what if brent miller left his job at the car wash ,
and on his way home
put the clown mask on to dump nick hamilton &apos;s body ?
yeah , you can drive a car right up to where
derrick said they were fishing .
you could bury the body on one of the dirt paths ,
knowing it was gonna be paved over .
okay , let &apos;s do a search at turtle pond
with a ground @-@ penetrating radar .
derrick johnson lives in town .
look at his weight -- 169 pounds .
right in line with the clown @-@ shoe impressions .
he had his license revoked for d.u.i. &apos; s .
pretty good rap sheet .
tried to commit suicide in custody .
being molested as a kid would sure give him motive now .
he lives in a men &apos;s shelter .
let &apos;s go pick him up .
derrick , do you know this man ?
no .
what about him ?
don &apos;t show me that . i hate clowns .
you hate clowns because of
what this man did to you , don &apos;t you ?
i was ...
8 years old .
and ... i just wanted to have an adventure .
you know , see what it was like to fish at night
for trout in turtle pond .
what happened ?
he said ...
&quot; hey , slugger . catch anything ? &quot;
and then he ...
then he caught me .
it must have made you very angry .
i hated him .
i hated what he did .
i hated what happened to me ...
because of him .
i still do .
did you hate him enough to kill him ?
yeah .
wouldn &apos;t you ?
excuse me . it &apos;s important .
i compared derrick &apos;s dna in codis
to the dna in the skin cells
found in the scrapings from under reynolds &apos; fingernails .
it &apos;s not derrick &apos;s dna .
but ... ?
i did find common markers .
so , our killer is someone related to derrick ?
closely related .
they found a body at turtle pond .
is it a boy ?
yeah .
and after that ,
you just push the drawer in like that .
it &apos;s that easy !
mm @-@ hmm . that &apos;s all you have to do , bud .
all right .
hi .
eli , uh ...
call mom and tell her to come pick you up , okay ?
yeah . okay .
all right , bud .
oh , it &apos;s great news
about that , uh -- the boy , kevin .
yeah . yeah . i &apos;m relieved .
so , you need my statement ?
no .
this is you
and your little brother derrick at turtle pond , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
yeah . why ?
you tried to kidnap a boy yesterday .
you ended up killing an innocent man --
a good samaritan who tried to stop you .
no , i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i brought you guys the boy &apos;s backpack . do you remember ?
you were driving brent &apos;s car , weren &apos;t you ?
and when kevin threw the backpack out the window ,
you knew you had to come back ,
because your fingerprints were on it .
n @-@ no .
you first tried to grab zack ,
but that went south when you killed a man .
but you had no choice , did you ?
&apos;cause you already had brent miller tied up in his basement ,
so you had to go through with your plan , grab another boy .
i don &apos;t know a brent miller .
no ?
okay , well , then you
wouldn &apos;t mind giving us a sample of your dna .
if you &apos;ll just chew on your cheek .
we can do a swab and be done .
show us your hands !
i know you want us to think you got a gun under there .
don &apos;t let it end like this .
no . end it .
shoot me .
no .
show us your hands .
think about your son , craig . don &apos;t do this to him .
come on .
there you go .
okay .
you wanted the world to know
what he did to your little brother , didn &apos;t you ?
you saw derrick .
how many lives did that man ruin , huh ?
you animal .
you perverted piece of crap .
did he molest you , too ?
is that why you put the gun to his head
and pulled the trigger ?
we have credit @-@ card receipts .
brent came into your store and bought supplies .
you recognized his voice , didn &apos;t you ?
he called my son ...
&quot; slugger . &quot;
why would you do it like this , craig ?
you traumatized two little boys .
i didn &apos;t mean to .
it just got out of control .
but i owed derrick that much .
&apos;cause i wanted that pedophile to admit it ,
you know , to expose him for who he was .
you wanted to do more than expose him .
yeah , i wanted him dead .
you &apos;re under arrest , craig .
can i say goodbye to my boy ?
yeah .
is angong booked ?
i can call her .
no , don &apos;t . i want to wallow .
what an awful case .
and he &apos;s still mad at me .
did you apologize ?
yes . repeatedly .
he &apos;ll get over it .
i &apos;m still mad .
i &apos;m still sorry .
i &apos;m still wallowing .
this sucks .
we know of two nice thai masseuses .
excuse me ?
certified massage therapists , detective frost ,
from the prestigious lotus palm school .
mm @-@ hmm . and who hasn &apos;t heard of the lotus palm school ?
okay . well , in that case ...
i get angong .
wait . you can &apos;t call dibs . you had her last time .
frost , can you give us a second ? i can too call dibs .
you cannot have angong every , single time !
i can too have angong every , single time !
