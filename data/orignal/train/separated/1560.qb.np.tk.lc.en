hope you &apos;re pacing yourself , mike .
dad , i &apos;m going to miss this audition . where are you ?
you were late .
i &apos;m sorry .
... and you stink like booze .
maybe i should just tell moms who you &apos;ve been talking to .
i wish i could help , but i don &apos;t have any more .
there &apos;s probably something at your house .
something your moms wouldn &apos;t miss and i could sell it .
i should &apos;ve realized you were never into brandon .
he &apos;s into you .
we &apos;re walking home . why don &apos;t you come with us ?
oh , no . i &apos;m staying .
are you sure you &apos;re ok ?
i &apos;m great .
you &apos;re not sending me to boarding school .
i don &apos;t know what they told you ...
i &apos;m undocumented .
and so are you . and if you send me anywhere ,
i &apos;ll call immigration myself .
stay away from me , stay away from sarah , or else you &apos;re ...
wyatt , let him go !
i told you to stay out of it and now you &apos;ve made it worse .
fine , i &apos;ll stay out of it for good .
hey , i wanted you to know i spoke with bill ,
and sarah has been removed from the olmstead &apos;s .
and i &apos;ve got a friend at the da &apos;s office
that i &apos;m talking to about liam .
i will let you know what happens , but just wanted you to know .
ok .
ok .
oh , jesus ...
i made that from scratch
with really good cheese .
it &apos;s great .
it &apos;s a lost cause , babe .
somebody pass me the tabasco ?
oh ...
i &apos;m kidding . kidding .
i like this .
i got to play this tomorrow for the grim reaper .
grim reaper ?
his music teacher .
he scares the crap out of me .
hey , miss thing . you know the rule no phones at the table .
brandon has his computer down here .
i &apos;m studying .
yeah , right . me , too .
before i take that away , what &apos;s so funny ?
just this thing that lexi sent me . you wouldn &apos;t get it .
did she just call me old ?
yep .
phone , down . please .
lexi must be excited , she gets to come back to school tomorrow .
her parents are letting her come back ?
that &apos;s cool .
they don &apos;t have much of a choice .
unless they want a visit from immigration .
blackmailing your parents isn &apos;t anything to be proud of .
no matter how mad she is at them .
they deserved it . i mean , what was lexi supposed to do ?
let them send her off to that convent ?
it &apos;s a girls &apos; school .
same difference .
i just hope they put this all behind them . they &apos;re a family .
in the end , that &apos;s all that matters .
all right , who &apos;s going to want dessert ?
we actually made apple tarts .
if i see ketchup , you &apos;re going to die .
don &apos;t forget dinner with gretchen tomorrow night .
yes .
you &apos;ll finally meet her .
we &apos;re going to leave money for you guys so you can order .
the fabled ex is in town .
oh , my god , i almost forgot we have a land line .
is that what that is ?
gretchen ? your ex @-@ girlfriend ?
ooh , the one who hangs out with movie stars ?
is she pretty ?
yeah , she &apos;s pretty ,
but she &apos;s not nearly as pretty as your mom .
well played , hon .
can somebody get that ?
it &apos;s got to be a sales call .
we should just get rid of it . no one ever uses it anyway .
hello ?
mariana , it &apos;s for you .
if that &apos;s lexi , please tell her we &apos;re still eating dinner .
hello ?
thinking about having a tart ?
oh , wait . you already have one .
thank you ...
anybody else ? apple tart ? apple tart ?
look , you can &apos;t call me here .
what choice do i have ? you just keep ignoring me .
you think it &apos;s easy getting to a computer ?
if they find out i was talking to you ...
why haven &apos;t you answered any of my emails ?
look , i can &apos;t give you anymore money . i don &apos;t even have any .
you said , that ...
maybe there was something in your house that wouldn &apos;t be missed .
you said that . look , i &apos;m not stealing from my mothers .
i &apos;m your mother .
look , i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t talk .
who was that ?
演唱者 kari kimmel
stop . stop .
did i do something wrong ?
no . but you didn &apos;t do anything right either .
when you were playing just now , what were you feeling ?
uh ... i don &apos;t know .
exactly .
if playing notes were all there was to this ,
we could program a machine to do it .
i &apos;m just trying to get it right .
and there &apos;s your problem .
you have to stop trying to get it right .
i would rather you made a hundred mistakes
than play it perfectly without ... risking anything .
you know , beethoven started going deaf when he was 26 .
he contemplated suicide .
imagine the world without the ninth symphony .
i &apos;d rather not , frankly .
the point is , instead of killing himself ,
he used his pain to create something beautiful .
i don &apos;t think i have that much pain .
thanks for lending this to me .
big thumbs up to joan didion .
yeah .
i can definitely see what
timothy meant by her writing was a hostile act .
speaking of hostile , are you mad at me about the other day ?
&apos;cause i yelled at you for hitting liam ?
i &apos;m having a little trouble
holding up both ends of this conversation , wyatt .
what do you want me to say ? i got reamed for protecting you .
like i was the bad guy or something .
yeah , i know . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just ...
things with liam are really complicated .
you &apos;re probably right .
it &apos;s probably way over my head .
no . no , it &apos;s not that .
liam ...
why don &apos;t you go tell brandon ?
you two seem pretty tight .
wyatt ...
there &apos;s nothing going on between me and brandon .
so , tell me about liam .
i knew him a couple of years ago , from an old foster home ,
and thankfully , he &apos;s out of my life
and i would just like to forget about him .
wow , you really opened up there .
i thought that &apos;s what you liked about me .
that i &apos;m mysterious . a little bit screwed up ...
you know , you might be a little too screwed up .
even for me .
演唱者 andy zipf
hey , what &apos;s up ?
um ... i know this is really weird ,
but this weekend is ... was our anniversary .
oh . right .
um , i ... i got these for you a while back
as a surprise before , you know .
wow . the weepies .
i know .
you should use them .
yeah , i really can &apos;t .
why not ? i want you to .
i just don &apos;t want you to get the wrong idea .
no , i know .
it &apos;s not what i meant .
you just loved the band so much , i want you to go .
right .
thank you . um ...
i just can &apos;t .
i got plans ...
i &apos;ve got to get to class .
later .
jesus !
i &apos;ve been looking for you all day . where &apos;ve you been ?
around . i tried to find you at lunch .
yeah , i had a makeup test for bio . it was freaking impossible .
all that endocrine system stuff ?
i &apos;m pretty sure i failed .
uh @-@ huh . good .
so , you want to hang out ?
you mean , right now ?
well , yeah .
i can &apos;t , i &apos;m sorry . tomorrow ?
sure . tomorrow .
great . i got to go . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
don &apos;t let her get to you .
she &apos;s not our mom , she &apos;s a con artist .
i &apos;m just going to tell her to leave me alone , ok ?
like you didn &apos;t do before all those other times ?
look , i know what she is , all right ?
even if you don &apos;t believe that .
even if i did believe that i wouldn &apos;t let you come here alone .
this isn &apos;t exactly la jolla .
this is it .
nice .
are you ok ?
you came .
oh , my god . jesus ...
can i get you something to drink or maybe something to eat ?
no .
we can &apos;t stay .
i was hoping ...
we just came to tell you in person
that we can &apos;t give you any money .
so , please stop asking and calling .
you don &apos;t understand , mariana . it &apos;s not what you think .
if you knew ... i was trying to tell you on the phone last night .
evan , these are my kids .
mariana and jesus .
i &apos;m out of cigarettes .
can you get me some soda ?
you got money ?
later .
is that your boyfriend ?
i don &apos;t want him to be .
not anymore . he &apos;s ...
if i try to leave ...
you see what he &apos;s like .
that &apos;s why i asked for money . to get out of here .
i need to get a bus ticket .
i was going to go to san francisco .
i have a cousin there .
last time you told me the money was for rehab .
it is , it was , it was ...
but now , i got to get out of town .
he always has drugs . he &apos;s always high .
i try to say no , but he gets so angry at me .
jesus ...
we can &apos;t give you money .
i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s what , your third one today ?
no way , mom . i can hold my coffee .
you look like hell , mike . what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
i &apos;ve just been working extra
shifts to pay for brandon &apos;s piano lessons .
not easy being a patron of the arts .
i &apos;m just tired , that &apos;s all .
you sure about that ?
because at mariana &apos;s quinceanera you got so loaded .

put your hands on the wheel where i can see them !
is something wrong ?

stef ...
mike , a little advice . don &apos;t talk .
just checking in .
you seemed kind of ... you know , this afternoon .
i don &apos;t need a whole speech on what a user our birth mother is .
she knows what to say .
she makes stuff up , jesus .
she didn &apos;t make up that skeezy ass boyfriend .
what ? you think if we give her money for bus fare
she &apos;s really going to buy a ticket ?
i told her no money , didn &apos;t i ?
did you mean it ? - yeah .
that doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t feel bad for her .
ah @-@ ha , i really hear the difference , babe .
your teacher &apos;s good , huh ?
i guess .
well , that &apos;s very nice of your dad to pay for those lessons .
i hope you let him know how much you appreciate it .
yes , i do . i tell him all the time .
how is he doing , your old dad ?
you spend more time with him than i do .
yeah , but we &apos;re on duty . that &apos;s different .
he just seems a little off these days .
i mean , i know that you had
to drive him home from mariana &apos;s party , yes ?
he was hung @-@ over when he picked me up for my audition with marshall .
yeah , so , if you &apos;re asking me if he &apos;s drinking again ...
yes .
you said &quot; drinking again . &quot;
you knew he was drinking before ?
yeah .
when ?
the divorce .
but you were little . you can &apos;t ...
i heard you guys fighting .
i &apos;m very sorry ...
i should &apos;ve never let that happen .
no , that &apos;s ok , mom . i would &apos;ve known anyway .
i mean ...
what ?
no , nothing ...
what , brandon ?
one time , he sort of ...
... drove off the road with me in the car .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i was afraid to .
did he tell you to keep quiet about this ?
no , i was afraid if you knew ,
that you wouldn &apos;t let me see him again .
that &apos;s why .
what happened out there yesterday ?
the suspect broke the hold and took off running ...
yeah , i can read , officer .
i mean , how did you let this happen ?
you know , you &apos;re damn
lucky he ran instead of grabbing mike &apos;s gun .
it was my fault , captain . i thought i had better control of him .
we had no reason to suspect that he would resist .
he was cooperative .
that &apos;s just beautiful .
you two done having each other &apos;s backs ?
mike , you can leave .
all right , i want the truth , stef . what is going on with him ?
is he drinking again ?
ok , everybody , i have to run to the office .
you have plenty to keep you busy .
again , let &apos;s see it again .

do i look ok ?
look , talya , all of this will be old news before you know it .
tomorrow , kelsey will fall on her butt in the quad ,
or someone will throw up in the fountain ,
and everyone will forget about this .
it &apos;s easy for you to say .
no , i know what it &apos;s like
when everyone &apos;s looking at you weird ,
whispering about you after you walk by .
it sucks . big time .
but you get over it .
i have to fix my make @-@ up .
well , thanks a lot .
what ?
you just got a new partner until further notice .
why , what &apos;s going on ?
oh , come on , stef .
you told roberts i was drinking .
she put me on desk duty .
i never said you were drinking .
you didn &apos;t say i wasn &apos;t .
i &apos;m not going to lie for you , mike .
the truth is you are drinking .
the quinceanera ? you were drinking .
that was a party .
was it a party last night ? the night before that ?
everybody has a drink after work , stef .
no , mike , everybody doesn &apos;t .
have i ever come to work drunk ?
wow . that &apos;s a pretty low bar you &apos;re setting there .
want another partner ? guess you got one .
i love your necklace . it &apos;s thai , isn &apos;t it ? mango wood .
if you say so , you &apos;re the world traveler .
stef bought it for me .
smart move meeting your ex .
you want to make a statement .
oh , don &apos;t flatter yourself .
oh , come on , i meant your wife .

ten years .
wow . two kids .

why didn &apos;t you ever get pregnant ? you always wanted kids .
and i have them .
right . of course .
oh , oh ... either your wife is here ,
or there &apos;s a bachelor party going on .
i am so sorry , honey . i got stuck at work .
you didn &apos;t have time to change ?
i &apos;m gretchen ,
and i happen to like a lady in uniform .
well , thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i appreciate that .
you look like you could use a drink .
you have no idea .
you can &apos;t drink in uniform .
who says i &apos;m staying in uniform ? i &apos;ll have a martini , please .
how do you like it ?
dirty .
ooh , i knew i was going to like you . make that two , please .
and for you ?
i &apos;ll have whatever red you have by the glass , please .
pinot . she can &apos;t handle anything full bodied .
oh , i don &apos;t know about that .
loving you .
but remember how sick you got on that bordeaux in paris ?
she threw up in the concorde fountain , it was tres romantique .

i got a lot of stories about our lovely lena .
so , enough about me .

where is everyone ?
your moms are at that dinner and everyone else ate .
you might want to warm that .
that was pretty bad today , what happened in algebra .
hey , maybe you should cut talya a break .
are you serious ? where is this coming from ?
i don &apos;t know . she apologized ...
but the journal wasn &apos;t the only reason i broke up with her .
i mean , she turned into a whiny , jealous mess .
maybe she had a right to be jealous .
ok , well , that doesn &apos;t explain the video .
she got drunk because she felt really stupid .
she saw me with wyatt , and i don &apos;t know ,
she thinks we &apos;re together .
she just realized that she had it all wrong .
did she ?
i mean , are you with wyatt ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe ... not really .
then why would she think that ?
your pizza &apos;s ready .
thank you .
so , have you ever shot someone ?
oh , luckily i haven &apos;t had to , no .
what do you do with your gun at home ? with the kids and all .
oh , i lock it up .
can we change the subject ?
she hates guns .
i know .
she doesn &apos;t like to talk about my work .
i can &apos;t believe she agreed to date you .
i took her home for christmas one year ...
not that story .
come on , it &apos;s a sweet story .
my dad &apos;s a hunter . made us go to the shooting range ...
oh , no ...
lena got one shot off , burst into tears .
i swear .
oh , sweetheart . i &apos;m so sorry .
no rush . any time you &apos;re ready .
thank you ...
no , no , no . i insist .
i invited you guys . you &apos;re my guests .
next time is on us then .
great .
as long as it &apos;s not another 10 years from now .
how long are you here for ?
couple of days .
why don &apos;t you have dinner with us tomorrow night ?
absolutely .
you can meet the kids .
yeah .
yeah ? sure you &apos;re not sick of me ?
not at all .
no , you can &apos;t copy my history homework .
and i &apos;ve got a ton left to do here .
so , you talk . i &apos;ll pretend to listen .
i just wanted to say you were 100 percent right about ana .
ok . you must want something .
we can &apos;t give her money ,
but we can help her get into a women &apos;s shelter .
i found a list of them .
no .
they &apos;re free .
we take her there and drop her off .
and then she &apos;ll say she needs money to live on .
for toothpaste or food . or whatever .
only she won &apos;t buy food with it .
this is what she does .
she gets in your head and makes you feel bad for her .
and then she uses you .
we can never go back to that house again .
okay ? you have to promise me .
i promise .
that was delicious !
right ?
thank you again , that was very generous .
oh , i &apos;m expecting a gourmet meal tomorrow night .
i can &apos;t promise gourmet .
oh , lena &apos;s a good cook .
mm @-@ hm . just don &apos;t let her make pot roast .
oh , i sense another story .
i think we &apos;ve had enough stories for one night .
ah , this is me . i will see you tomorrow .
goodbye . nice to meet you . be safe .
what &apos;s wrong ?
did you have to invite her over ?
she &apos;s going to come meet the kids .
she just bought us a very expensive meal .
money is easy for gretchen .
ok , she &apos;s your ex . i was just trying to be nice .
you were kind of ganging up on me .
what are you talking about ?
&quot; the look ? &quot;
what ? you have a look .
this is why i don &apos;t hang out with exes .
well ... she was a little &quot; fabulous &quot; but i like her .
and no one was ganging up on you . come on .
it doesn &apos;t bother you that we were together
for 18 months over a decade ago ,
and she acts like she knows me better than you ?
no , because she doesn &apos;t .
come on , it &apos;s an ex thing . &quot; i had her first . &quot; mike does it , too .
you look beautiful .
uh , she said you &apos;re going to pay for it .
you &apos;re telling me .
演唱者 odessa rose
funny .
that &apos;s for not telling me why you blew me off yesterday .
mariana says you guys went to go see your birth mom .
which is cool .
as long as that &apos;s the only reason you &apos;ve been avoiding me .
i have not been avoiding you .
you sure about that ?
yeah , i just ... i got a lot on my mind right now .
what &apos;s going on ?
why are you acting so weird ?
because your parents found out about us ?
no , it &apos;s because i found out about them .
and about me .
lexi , you &apos;re as american as i am .
i still feel the same about you . nothing &apos;s changed .
everything &apos;s changed .
every time i see a police car , i can barely catch my breath .
hey . i &apos;m not going to let anything bad happen to you .
i promise .
that &apos;s sweet .
but that &apos;s not really a promise you can keep .
i just feel so freaking alone .
you &apos;re not alone . you &apos;ve got your parents , you &apos;ve got mariana ...
you &apos;ve got me .
peace , ok ? you &apos;re like my only friend here ,
so you kind of have to talk to me ...
whether you like it or not .
that &apos;s progress . excellent .
um ... i have to see this
silent film at the luxe for my photography class .
do you want to go with me ?
can &apos;t talk during the movie , so it &apos;ll be just like now .
i can &apos;t . i have a thing .
ok .
well , when your thing gets boring ,
you know where to find me .
yeah ?
hey . is ana here ?
you knew justin timberlake ?

mm @-@ hm .
oh , my god !
george clooney asked me to show him around beijing .
i do a lot of business there , so i &apos;m a great tour guide .
ok , wait a minute . you know george clooney ?
we almost died together in the sudan .
we were in one of those
dinky little planes and we hit a windstorm .
you haven &apos;t lived until george has passed out in your lap .
nice .
why are you lying to me right now ?
your mom knows famous people , too .
we had dinner with clinton in angkor wat . remember ?
clinton . really ?
don &apos;t get too excited .
it was bill , not hillary .
hey , your mom and i traveled , too .
remember that night we spent in barstow ?
how could i forget ? my birthday weekend ,
greasy cheeseburgers ,
a roach infested motel , and a two dollar bottle prosecco .
only the best for you , my love .
oh , jesus wants to know if he can go to a movie with lexi .
yeah , as long as he &apos;s home for curfew .
oh , i won &apos;t get to meet him ?
it &apos;s friday night .
and i &apos;m the only single one in the house .
that &apos;s not true . brandon is single , too .
i don &apos;t know about that .
he just went to that concert tonight with talya .
so , that &apos;s back on ?
i guess so .
what about you ? do you have a girlfriend ?
a few . i like to play the field .
although , i must say ,
your moms do make marriage look almost bearable .
well , they &apos;re not actually married .
really ? you didn &apos;t do it when it was legal before ?
stef , here , doesn &apos;t believe in gay marriage .
that &apos;s not true . i believe
marriage is a state mind , not a matter of state .
but you were married to mike .
look how that turned out .
because you &apos;re gay .
we &apos;re domestic partners .
that &apos;s the same thing .
is it ?
well , if it were ,
why all the fuss about marriage equality ?
no , that &apos;s just not that important to us .
it &apos;s important to lena .
unless you &apos;ve changed your mind since we were together .
i &apos;m going to go check on those cornish hens .
mariana , would you please set the table ?
you got jesus . talk to me .
hey , i know you &apos;re not with lexi .
you better not be at ana &apos;s .
call me .
mm . maybe not gourmet , but that was delicious .
i never knew you could cook .
mm . so , people do change , obviously .
i get the feeling that you haven &apos;t changed that much .
can i be excused ?
sure , honey .
i don &apos;t know ...
i used to say that i would never settle down ,
but lately i &apos;ve been thinking if i met the right person ...
well , that is a change .
lena broke up with me because i wouldn &apos;t marry her .
that is not true . it wasn &apos;t even legal anywhere back then .
but you wanted a wedding .
you wanted a wedding ?
mm @-@ hm .
i broke up with you because you weren &apos;t monogamous .
yeah , there was that .
and you slept with my best friend .
and that . but , now , i &apos;m willing
to walk down the aisle and you &apos;re not .
how did that happen ?
i don &apos;t need a piece of paper and a ceremony
to prove our love and commitment .
but you would like it .
sure .
really ? why is this the first i &apos;m hearing of it ?
you made it clear that you never wanted to get married again .
and i was under the impression it wasn &apos;t important to you .
look , i didn &apos;t mean to open a can of worms ...
didn &apos;t you ?
you know , i have an early flight , maybe i should go .
ok ...
well , thank you for dinner .
and it was great to meet you .
nice meeting you .
i &apos;ll walk you out .
... talk to me .
ok , now i &apos;m totally freaking out .
why aren &apos;t you calling me back or answering my texts ?
i &apos;m starting to think something bad happened to you .
i don &apos;t care if you &apos;re at ana &apos;s . just ... just call me .
well , that was awkward .
no one asked her to leave .
we didn &apos;t ask her to stay .
ten years together .
how is it i didn &apos;t know you want to be married .
look , it &apos;s like you said .
for all intents and purposes , we are married .
but you want a wedding and the whole thing ...
lena , it &apos;s embarrassing that i didn &apos;t know that .
i assumed you did .
so , all these years , you &apos;ve been expecting me to propose to you ?
were you expecting some flash mob or something ?
don &apos;t be an ass .
don &apos;t tell me how to react , lena .
can i talk to you ?
can it wait , mariana ?
no .
um ... so , i got in contact with our birth mom .
with ana .
yes ?
and , um ...
she &apos;s living in town ,
in a crackhouse or something .
and ...
i &apos;m pretty sure jesus is there with her now .
i &apos;m so sorry .
what are you doing ?
going to get our son .
can you get the address from mariana , please ?
stef , wait .
don &apos;t you think we should call the police ?
what do you think i am ?

i &apos;m just going to go get jesus and leave . so don &apos;t worry .
mariana , i need the address of that house , please .

yeah , but on one condition .

to my non @-@ existent &quot; thing &quot; like , right now .
i said , ok .

what do you think they &apos;re saying ?
why is he giving her so much shampoo ?
oh , my dear .
you have to get out of bed , your hair is a mess .
no , no , no . you must take this back and take this back ...
what &apos;s at the bottom of your bag ? is it a badger ?
badger ?
yes , that &apos;s my pet badger .
i think it &apos;s very rude for you
to talk about him like he &apos;s not here .
here , let me put him away ...
before he gets his feelings hurt .
you taste like badger , george .
something you want to tell me ?
their harmonies are amazing .
i wonder what it &apos;s like ,
being married and working together .
romantic or exhausting .
probably both .
anyway ... thanks .
so , how &apos;s your music ?
um ... i finally started taking lessons from henry marshall .
what ? oh , my god . that &apos;s amazing .
i mean , it &apos;s not that big of a deal .
yes , it is . you were totally
crushed when he didn &apos;t pick you last year .
yeah ...
how is it ?
the lessons , i mean .
uh , fine . i guess .
i mean , he &apos;s not exactly the warmest dude i &apos;ve ever met .
they never are .
yeah . i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m going to stay with him .
brandon , you have to .
it &apos;s what you dreamed of .
yeah , the lessons are really expensive .
it puts a lot of pressure on my dad .
you &apos;ll be fine .
i don &apos;t think marshall thinks it will .
he says i need to &quot; face my pain . &quot;
right ?
i don &apos;t even think i &apos;ve ever had
the kind of pain he &apos;s talking about .
do you want to grab a coffee ?
i &apos;d like that .
ok .
