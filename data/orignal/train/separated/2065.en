Robert Zane made you an offer.
He did.
You begged me for a second chance.
And now he's using you to destroy us.
You waltzed in here thinking this was gonna be
like some prison movie, but it's not.
It's just prison.
Welcome to Danbury.
Mike Ross.
Frank Gallo.
We're being sued for every case Mike Ross has ever touched.
You won't admit this whole thing is your fault
in the first place.
My fault?
If I hadn't brought Mike in, you'd still be here
sniveling around like a Goddamn junior partner.
Your fiancé, you want to call her?
Maybe I'll just send Rachel a text.
We need to move the money that we have
in every account by tomorrow.
We don't need to move it.
We can use their buy-ins to settle the class-action lawsuits.
All right, let's go.
I'm in the right cell. I'm in the one you gave me.
Yeah, but this isn't the one they gave me.
You said you could've turned on a guy to get out of here,
but you didn't because you owe him.
Well, I owe that son of a bitch too.
You son of a bitch.
Take it easy, Mike.
And remember, I know about you.
And I got your little girlfriend's number right here.
You keep watching that clock,
it's gonna be a long two years.
Believe it or not, I've been where you are right now.
You've been thinking about how to get back
at that son of a bitch all night.
Spit in his oatmeal.
Shit on his pillow.
Whatever it is, my advice to you is don't do it.
I don't need any advice from you.
Excuse me?
You're the one
that left me alone with that psychopath in the first place.
Now I get why you haven't
said a word to me since last night.
How the hell did you think I'd react
after something like that?
Hey, listen, man.
I don't have anything against you,
but I sure as hell don't have anything for you.
And I'm not gonna cause trouble with a guy like that
for someone I've never even met, so if he wants me
to switch for a few hours, I'm switching.
To hell with what happens to me, right?
Hey, I didn't say that.
No, you just did it.
Donna, what are you doing here?
I come bearing gifts.
That's really nice, but you don't have to come over here
to check on me. I'm fine.
Says the girl in her fiancé's shirt.
Look, I know it's cheesy.
Rachel, you wanted to feel him next to you.
It's not cheesy.
Thanks, Donna.
Well, you do owe me a thank you,
but it's not for that.
Because in a couple of hours it's going to be more
than his shirt wrapped around you.
Are you saying that you got me on the visitor's list,
because they said that if I'm not family--
I don't care what they said. You're his family.
And you're my family, and I wasn't going to sleep last night
until I got you on that list.
I-I don't know what to say.
Say, "Thank you, Donna," and get your ass up there.
What you got in your hand there, tiger?
Dark roast, splash of cream, no sugar.
And to what do I owe the honor?
I was thinking this morning about the day
you picked me out of the mailroom
and how far we've come.
You know, it's funny.
I was thinking this morning about how far we've fallen.
Then let's go put these lawsuits to bed.
Excuse me, Officer?
I know the phones don't open until 10:00,
but I was wondering if it's possible for me
to make a phone call?
Get back in line and eat your breakfast.
Please. The only reason I'm asking
is 'cause it's an emergency. I just need a little--
What, are you on fire?
Your leg broken?
'Cause it looks to me like you're trying to call
someone out there about something that happened in here.
You don't understand, all right, my fiancé is--
No, you don't understand.
Unless there's a bomb headed for us,
nothing that happens out there has anything to do
with what happens in here. You got that?
Yeah, got it.
Hey, I left in such a hurry last night,
didn't get a chance to say good-bye.
Well, I'll say it now.
Have a nice life. Leave me alone.
Don't you want to see a copy of the pictures
your fiancé sent me last night?
That's bullshit. She didn't send you anything.
You're right, she didn't.
She sent 'em to you.
I mean, you're the one who started it all,
telling her how much you missed her.
How hard do you think it was for me to get her
to send a sexy picture to you after that?
I think that kids today call it a selfie.
There's no way she sent you a picture like that.
You're right, it wasn't sexy.
But what I did, I photoshopped her face
onto a body that is.
I did such a good job,
no one in here is ever gonna notice.
Yeah. I made copies.
One for each guy in the joint.
Usually, a situation like this, I would charge a fortune.
But today, I'm feeling so generous
I'm going to give them away for free.
Get off him, Gallo!
What? I didn't do shit! He attacked me!
That is bullshit!
I tried to tell you that's the guy.
I don't care what you tried to do.
You wanted an emergency, now you got it.
Get 'em both out of here.
What?
Good morning, Ms. Pearson, Mr. Specter,
can I offer either of you a hot towel?
Miss, would you mind telling me who hired you?
I think we both know who hired her.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm making copies.
Goddamn it.
We don't bill you out at 350 an hour to make copies.
Now get your ass back to work.
That motion isn't going to file itself.
Louis, what the hell did you do?
What? What are you talking about?
We don't have the money to hire associates,
paralegals, and support staff.
I know that.
I'm not an idiot, they're not support staff.
Who the hell are they?
They're movie extras.
How much weed did you smoke last night?
We have a settlement meeting in an hour.
And if these offices are empty when they walk in,
we are gonna look like shit.
Louis, did it occur to you
that we're using the threat of bankruptcy in that meeting,
and if these offices are filled,
it kills that plan?
Everybody drop whatever the hell it is you're doing
and hand your timecards in to my secretary.
And if they are marked one second late,
I swear to God,
you will never be fake associates in this town again.
Next.
Hi.
Inmate's name?
Mike Ross. I'm here for visitation.
It appears Mr. Ross is not receiving visitors today.
I-I don't understand.
I was told that I was on the approved visitors list.
It says visitation has been suspended for two weeks
because of an altercation he had this morning.
No, that can't be right. He just got here yesterday.
It can be right, and it is right.
Well then, I need to see him right away.
And I just told you you can't do that.
Yes, I can. Because not only am I his fiancé,
I'm also his lawyer.
It says here a Harvey Specter is his lawyer.
And he works at Pearson, Specter, Litt, and so do I.
This card says paralegal.
I don't care what it says.
You don't let me in there and something's wrong with him,
I will make it my life's purpose to make your life a living hell.
Ma'am, I worked maximum security for ten years,
so if you think I'm gonna be intimidated by the likes of you,
you've got another thing coming.
You know, usually it takes prisoners a couple of weeks to get their first violation.
You've been here less than 24 hours.
That might just be a record.
Yeah, I don't care. I need to make a phone call.
You're not making anything after what you just did.
I didn't do anything. He set me up.
I don't care what he did.
So all that stuff about you helping me become a "better version" of myself,
that was bullshit?
No, it wasn't.
Then what exactly did you mean?
Because if you won't even hear my side of the story,
then how are you gonna help me?
All right, what do you mean he set you up?
I mean, he paid off a guard,
then he posed as my roommate,
and the next thing I know, he's about to hand out pictures of my fiancé
to every inmate in this entire prison.
There's no evidence of any pictures.
But they were all over the floor.
This is what was all over the floor.
Listen to me, there might not be any proof,
but I am telling you that he paid off a guard
and you need to do something about it.
Brother, I don't have any authority over the guards.
Then what exactly am I doing here?
You are learning how to deal with the bullshit life throws your way
without making your situation worse.
And how the hell am I supposed to do that?
This isn't just a tea party.
The purpose of this meeting is to decide if you are worth rehabilitating or not.
And if I am?
Then I get you a job.
And if I'm not?
Then you never see me again.
And the next time you have an incident,
you will go to solitary confinement for a month.
So I suggest you go back to your cell
and you think long and hard about what you want to accomplish during your time here.
I have to say,
I'm glad you've decided to settle
rather than fight these suits.
Well, as you can see, things are a little tight around here,
so you have us at a disadvantage.
What I have is the fact that you don't want to be talking
about having hired a fraud in court for the next six months.
No, we don't, so...
With all due respect, this isn't an offer,
it's a typo.
And with all due respect, this isn't a lawsuit,
it's a shakedown.
Bullshit.
This is a chance for you to wipe the slate clean
with the clients you defrauded.
And $10 million is a hell of a goddamn wipe.
It's ten cents on the dollar.
If you don't take it, it's going to be zero cents on the dollar.
What the hell are you talking about?
This money is from our partner buy-in fund.
It's the only cash we have.
And once the partners find out that we're using it to settle,
they're gonna come after it.
So you have about an hour
to sign on the dotted line,
or that money's gone forever.
So take a look around, Arlene,
'cause once it's gone, there isn't any more left.
You knowingly defrauded your own clients.
You made a mockery of the legal system.
And I won't let you get away with it.
You want to know something, Arlene?
We did something wrong, and now we're paying for it.
But I'm getting a little sick and tired
of people acting like Mike Ross screwed them over.
He gave his heart and soul to every client he ever had,
and if those cases were reopened,
they would end up exactly in the same place.
So, you can sign that deal or not,
but I'm not gonna spend another second
dealing with a parasite like you.
Donna, where's Harvey? I need to talk to him.
He's finishing up a negotiation.
This can't wait.
Why? What's going on?
I got up there and they turned me away.
No, that can't be. I got you on that list.
That's not it. They turned me away
because he got into a fight.
What? With who?
I don't know.
All I know is that I went to go and see him,
they said he got into a fight,
and then they wouldn't let me in.
Good.
How is that good?
Because if they wouldn't let you in,
it means he fought back.
You don't lose visitation if you just got jumped.
Harvey, I don't care if he fought back or not.
It doesn't mean that he's okay.
Rachel, listen to me. They have an obligation
to tell you if he's in the infirmary.
Did they tell you he was in the infirmary?
No.
Okay, then this is what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna call up there and get to the bottom of this,
but it might take a while, so I need you to be patient.
Okay.
Donna, cancel my afternoon
and have Ray meet me downstairs in five minutes.
I thought you said you weren't worried about Mike.
I only said that so that she wouldn't worry.
They only take visitation away if you're the one
who starts the fight,
which means something Goddamn happened down there
and I'm gonna figure out what it is.
Gretchen, what can I do for you?
Well, I thought since everyone was gone
maybe I could help myself to the executive kitchen for a change.
For a change?
I wanted to let you know that I had no idea
those people were leaving or I never would have gone
to that appointment.
I know, Gretchen.
I would also like to point out
that since they did leave,
between me, you, and Rachel Zane,
this firm just got a whole lot blacker.
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
that has nothing to do with anything.
Gretchen, as long as you're here--
You want to know if I can handle the reception desk
and Louis at the same time.
How did you know I was going to ask you that?
Because that's what good secretaries do.
Sure as shit is.
Well, there's one thing about everybody being gone.
When would the three of us ever find ourselves
in here just shooting the shit?
And when would you have thought that was a good thing?
This one is a keeper.
I know.
Oh, and for the record,
I'm black in here.
What are you doing here?
What do you mean
what am I doing here? I want to know what's going on.
What's going on? Nothing's going on.
I'm in prison.
Nothing's going on?
Then why do you look like that?
It is none of your business.
Well, I'm making it my business
because Rachel came to visit you this morning,
and they told her you got in a fight.
Yeah, well, why don't you do what you always do
and make up some bullshit and tell her it's not true?
Because I'm busy trying to survive in here.
Why won't you tell me?
Because you'll try and handle it for me.
Well, maybe I should be handling it for you
because you're too stupid
not to piss someone off on the first day.
Okay, Harvey. You want to know what happened?
It wasn't me who pissed him off.
It was you.
What are you talking about?
Frank Gallo.
Holy shit.
What's he doing in here?
I don't know. I was hoping you'd tell me that.
I put him away for racketeering.
That doesn't make any sense.
Last time I checked, that doesn't land him in here.
You're right.
A guy like Gallo only lands in here for one reason:
good behavior.
Why are you saying that like it's a good thing?
Because bad behavior can get him out.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go to the warden.
Tell him the whole story.
We'll get him outta here within the week.
That's exactly why I did not want to tell you.
Look, these guards are corrupt.
You go to the warden, it gets back to Gallo,
he's gonna come after me twice as hard.
It's one week instead of two years.
Look, we got a chance to get him outta here, I'm gonna take it.
He's got Rachel's phone number.
that's all the more reason to do it...
God damn it, Harvey!
You pushed me to beat the shit out of you
so that you'd know I could take care of myself in here,
now are you gonna let me do that,
or are you gonna cut my legs out from under me?
I'll stay out of it.
I want your word.
I won't go to the warden.
I was wondering when you'd show up.
Don't act like you don't remember me, Harvey.
We both know why you're here.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm here because I represent the prison.
Bullshit.
I pulled a string and you came.
You think it's a coincidence I'm standing here
while you're walking out?
Okay, Gallo, you got my attention.
You want me to step inside?
Or you want to come out here?
We both know that's not possible.
You owe me 13 years.
I'm gonna collect.
I didn't do anything to you
that that investigator didn't start and you know it.
Well, if his little boyfriend ever shows up in here,
I'll be sure to take it up with him.
What do you want, Gallo?
I already have what I want.
Which is knowing that every time your phone rings,
you're gonna ask yourself is this the call where you find out
that the guy who's in here for you
is never coming out.
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.
you think I can't hurt you in here?
I'll put a Goddamn bounty on your head.
I'll pay 'em whatever it takes to break your legs.
And if that doesn't work,
I'll wait till you get out and I'll kill you myself.
So unless you want that to happen,
don't you ever even look at Mike Ross again.
Ring, ring, counselor.
Ring, ring.
I knew I'd find you here.
'Cause this is where you come
when you think you just beat somebody.
What can I do for you, Jack?
You can tell me you used your own money to settle that lawsuit.
'Cause if you didn't, we're gonna have a problem.
Then I'd say we have a problem.
God damn it. You used the buy-in fund.
Yes, we did.
Then I guess...
I'll see you in court.
You're suing me personally?
It's your name on the door.
Jack.
I know corporate structures were never your strong suit,
so I'm gonna explain something to you.
We may use the word "Partnership,"
but this is a LLC.
And no judge in the world
is going to let you pierce that corporate veil.
They will once they learn you knowingly hired a fraud.
One has nothing to do with the other.
And if you really did find a judge who would do that,
then you'd be here with an army of lawyers and a Brinks truck
instead of standing alone with a flimsy piece of paper
in your sweaty little hands.
You can talk tough all you want, Jessica.
The fact is, I do have an army of lawyers and you don't.
What are you talking about?
I took that job with Robert Zane after all.
And I'm willing to drag this fight out,
so the choice is yours.
Give us our money or go out of business.
Can I talk to you for a second?
About what?
Listen, a man's cell should be the one place he can feel safe.
I took that away from you, and I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't do shit for me in here.
I know.
That's why I want to make it up to you.
Are you kidding me?
That's exactly what got me in this situation in the first place.
I know that.
But I also know you wanted to call
whoever you wanted to call this morning.
And I'm trying to make it up to you.
Yeah, well, this doesn't do that.
Hey, look, I can get in a lot of trouble
for just letting you know I have this.
Why don't you do something else that can get you into trouble?
What are you talking about?
Tell them that Gallo paid the guards to have you switch.
I can't do that.
Yeah, because you're afraid of him.
You're damn straight I am.
And on top of that,
I'd make a permanent enemy of everyone else in here,
because the worst thing you can be known for, my man,
is as someone who would do something like that.
Which means I get to deal with this all by myself.
It's all right, you can stay.
It doesn't matter if he stays or goes,
I got nothing to say to you.
That's okay, 'cause I got something to say to you.
You want to know what my favorite time of day is in here?
It's right now.
Got the TV going.
Guys are sitting around playing cards, telling jokes.
You almost forget you're in prison,
which is why I came over here.
'Cause I want to make sure you never forget.
There's gonna come a time
when this place isn't filled with people,
and you and I are alone.
Then all those vicious threats
your boy Harvey Specter made to me today
aren't gonna save you.
I heard today was a good day for Rand, Kaldor, Zane.
If this is about me hiring Jack Soloff's department,
I didn't do it to stick it to you.
They were leaving anyway.
Maybe.
But if your first move
is to have them come after their partner money,
then I must have been wrong that we were on good terms.
Jessica, I accepted your apology.
I wouldn't say that makes us on good terms.
But I had nothing to do with him coming after your money.
That's between you and him.
But you do have the power to stop it.
And I am not in the habit of telling my brand new employees
what they can and can't do.
Well, I need you to do it anyway.
Jessica--
Robert...
I need this.
And I know it's not your style
to tell your partners what to do,
but if you don't make it your style,
I'm dead in the water.
This is Harvey Specter.
You have a call from Danbury Federal Prison.
Do you accept the charges?
Yes.
I do not understand your response.
Yes. God damn it.
Please respond yes or no.
Yes.
Hello.
Mike, thank God.
Thank God what?
You looked me in the eye
and you said you would stay out of it.
You couldn't even make it to the parking lot
without threatening Gallo?
Mike, listen to me.
No, what, so you can lie to me again?
Or are you gonna tell me you didn't do that?
Look, I didn't do it because I didn't think
you could handle yourself.
I did it because he got under my skin.
I don't give a shit why you did it.
You swore you wouldn't.
Instead, you've made things worse.
Harvey, if I can't even trust you,
then I do not stand a chance in here.
Look, I can't talk right now.
What do you mean you can't talk?
Rachel's in my office looking at me right now
and she's gonna think something's wrong in five seconds,
so unless you've changed your mind about me not telling her,
I gotta go.
Harvey, you gotta get the phone from her.
Sure, Rick, no problem.
Harvey, get the phone from her.
8:30 sounds great.
First round's on you.
Rachel, good, you're here.
I was just gonna come see you.
I didn't hear from you, so I just figured--
He's good. There was an error in the paperwork.
It's a different inmate, same last name.
Okay. So I can see him tomorrow.
Actually, he asked that you give him a little time.
What?
Rachel, prison is a big adjustment.
He'll be ready in about two weeks.
So then, why do I have about 50 texts from him
saying that he can't wait to see me?
What?
Harvey, what's going on?
Give me the phone.
No.
I said give me the phone.
I'm not giving you anything
until you tell me what's going on.
Those texts aren't from Mike.
Then who are they from?
From a guy I put away when I was an ADA.
Oh, my God.
Rachel, don't let your imagination run wild.
It's gonna be okay.
You don't know that
because you're not in there.
You're right, I'm not.
Then what the hell are you gonna do about it?
I'm gonna do what I promised Mike.
I'm gonna have faith that he can handle it.
I don't believe it. So you're not gonna do anything?
You think I don't want to bust him outta there right now?
Look, if I try and do something and it doesn't work,
it makes it worse for him.
Is he violent?
Rachel--
Is he violent?
I made him a promise--
I don't give a shit.
He's in there to protect you,
so you better figure out a way to protect him
because Goddamn it, Harvey,
if something happens to him in there
and you didn't do anything,
I will never forgive you.
Harvey, I know you don't need me to tell you this,
but she's right,
because if something actually does happen to Mike,
even if she forgives you,
you're never gonna forgive yourself.
What do you want, Harvey?
Five minutes of your time and that's all.
Five minutes to catch up, or five minutes to ask a favor?
Five minutes to help me protect Mike Ross.
Protect him how? 'Cause last time I checked,
he was in the bosom of the federal penitentiary system.
Sean, he's in there with a guy I put away
and the guy is no joke.
I'm sorry to hear that, Harvey.
But what am I supposed to do?
You're supposed to move the guy to another prison.
I don't have the authority to do that and you know that.
You can get the authority.
You're a federal prosecutor.
Then why the hell don't you go after the prosecutor
that put Mike away in the first place?
'Cause she doesn't owe me, and you do.
You got a lot of balls saying that to me
when the entire time we were working together,
you knew the kid was a fraud.
That kid helped you take down
Charles Forstman and Eric Woodall
and put you on the map.
The map? Bullshit.
I was on the map long before I met either of you.
You're going to tell me you haven't shot up the ranks
since that conviction?
You know, Harvey, when you first walked in here,
for a second I actually thought you were gonna apologize
for lying to me all that time.
I don't need your forgiveness, Sean.
I need your help.
All right, I'll see what I can do.
But, Harvey,
now you owe me one.
Jack?
I've had a long day. What are you doing here?
You know what I'm doing here.
You went to Robert Zane and you had him shut us down.
I did what I had to do.
Now if you'll excuse me.
All I wanted was my money back.
Well, the sooner you get used to the fact that it's gone,
the sooner we can both move on with our lives.
That's the problem. I can't move on with my life.
What are you talking about?
I can't afford Zane's buy-in.
What?
How is that possible?
Jessica, listen to me.
You know what I did that Hardman found out about,
but what you don't know is why I did it.
I needed the money.
And now you want me to give you your money back
out of my own pocket?
Jessica, please.
This is a chance for me to have a new start.
Even if I wanted to, I can't do that.
Why not?
You know why not.
I pay you out of my own pocket.
I'm piercing that corporate veil myself.
And if the partners find out, it will cost me millions.
They won't find out.
Well, I can't take that chance.
Jessica, I need this.
I'm sorry, Jack.
I can't help you.
Morning.
What?
You know what.
Do I have something in my teeth?
No, but you got some bullshit in your brain.
Excuse me?
"Black in here."
Please, you're the whitest woman I ever met.
is that a fact?
Tell me something different.
How about I show you something different?
Is that...
Yep.
You gotta be kidding me.
Nope.
What year was that?
'96.
How long were you together?
Seven months.
That that, Mrs. Hater.
Before his last album or after?
Who do you think that song was about?
Shit. "Black in here."
She's black all over.
I'm glad we came to an agreement.
And it's usually not my habit
to court a dalliance with opposing counsel,
but I couldn't help but notice
you don't have a ring on your finger.
Not in a million years, Mr. Litt.
Go back to your own side.
Man puts himself out there, the least you can do is...
Regarding the class action against Pearson, Specter, Litt,
do both parties agree to the terms of the settlement?
We do, Your honor.
We do as well, Your Honor.
Then unless there are any objections,
I see no reason for this court not to ratify--
I have an objection, Your Honor.
What?
And you are?
His name is A. Elliott Stemple, Your Honor,
and he has no standing in this case.
Mr. Litt.
I have no standing, Your Honor.
But I represent Rothman Insurance,
a company not included in the class of clients
misrepresented by a firm that knowingly hired a fraud.
There's not one shred of proof we knowingly did anything.
But there is proof that you employed a fraud,
which is why you're settling with Ms. Rosen
in the first place.
Are you in on this?
Are you kidding me?
All right, Mr. Stemple. Submit your evidence.
The court will rule on it tomorrow.
We may have agreed to ten cents on the dollar,
but if this goes south,
we're coming after you for every penny you've got.
You little son of a bitch.
Watch it, Litt. We're in a court of law.
I don't care where we are. Jack Soloff put you up to this,
and I know it.
So what?
So I'm gonna prove it.
And when the judge realizes what you did,
he's gonna throw your ass in jail.
Really? Huh.
Because the way I see it, the judge is gonna certify
that my client is a member of this class because they are one
whether Jack tipped me off to them or not.
And when that happens, I kill the deal,
and your money goes back to
the partners that you took it from.
So, why don't you march your fat feet
back to the only two lawyers left
at that miserable little firm
and decide just how deep you're gonna reach
into your own pockets to pay me off.
Because as I see it, phew,
you have about 24 hours until you lose everything.
What do you want now, Harvey?
I wanted to apologize for what happened with Gallo.
It was wrong.
Shouldn't have happened, and I'm sorry.
But?
But I don't care what I promised you
because I found a way to get him out of here,
and I'm gonna take it.
I told you, you go to the warden--
I'm not going to the warden. I went to Sean Cahill.
Which means Gallo won't know about it
until they're putting shackles on him
to take him back to wherever the hell he came from.
What are you not telling me?
I put him away for racketeering.
But that's not what he really did.
What are you talking about?
We had him for conspiracy to commit murder.
And the police let the tape of that bastard admitting
that he did it out of the chain of custody
for 20 minutes.
So you went after him for racketeering instead.
I used every trick I had to put him away
for 15 years for three crimes
that would have added to five years at the most.
And that's why he hates you so much.
It's also why I need you to lay low
until I can get him out of here.
Oh, I can appreciate that, Harvey,
but I can't exactly hide in my cell 24 hours a day.
Then I suggest you do the complete opposite.
You know, I don't normally take walk-ins.
Sorry.
Well, as long as you're here.
Well, I thought about it, and...
I'd like a job.
And if it's not too much trouble,
I'd like it to be in front of as many people as possible.
And why is that?
It'll be easier for me to stay out of trouble in a crowd.
Good.
Because I got you a job in the kitchen.
Thank you.
Don't thank me. Thank yourself.
If you hadn't come in to see me,
I never would have told you about it.
Is that true?
You don't really take walk-ins?
Nah.
Just something to say.
The billing records are right there.
Mike was at the meeting.
Shit, you're right. He's got us.
You know what this means.
I do.
Louis, I just got your message.
What's going on?
Harvey, we got a problem,
and you're not going to like it.
Elliott Stemple showed up in court
with an excluded member of the class.
Elliott Stemple? Are you kidding me?
He ambushed me, Harvey. The judge was about to ratify
the settlement when he comes out of nowhere.
What was I supposed to do?
You prove his client isn't part of the class,
and you shut this thing down.
I can't do that because his client is a part of the class.
What? That's not possible.
Yes, it is.
Mike took one meeting with Rothman Insurance.
Jack Soloff told Stemple about it.
No way.
It's all right here, Harvey.
And if we don't pay him off tonight,
he kills that deal tomorrow
and we're out of business ten minutes later.
Bullshit. That's blackmail.
I'm not giving in to blackmail.
Oh, come on, do you think I want to do this?
He's got us by the balls, Harvey.
If we don't pay him, what was everything we went through
the other night even for?
Which means right now, we just have to figure out
how much we're willing to pay.
No, we don't.
Harvey, what are you saying?
I'm saying Stemple doesn't care about you two.
He just wants to get in a room with me and see me bleed.
You are not paying that man out of your pocket.
Yes, I am.
Harvey, Jessica's right.
No, she's not.
We all know I got us into this mess.
It's time for me to get us out of it.
All right, you want him, you got him.
But you're gonna be tempted to rip that man's head off,
and when that happens, you're not going to do that.
You're going to pay him.
And then you're going to throw his sorry ass out of here.
Harvey, do you have a minute?
If it's quick. Someone's on their way over.
I want to apologize to you about earlier.
You don't need to do that.
Yes, I do.
I know that you're doing what you feel is best.
I just...
I didn't think this was going to be as hard as it is.
For me too.
And for what it's worth,
I took your advice.
I'm gonna get that guy out of there.
Thank you.
Rachel?
He's gonna be okay.
Aren't you getting a little long in the tooth
for that hottie I just saw in the hall?
Let's get to it, Stemple, because I'm not in the mood.
How much?
How much what?
How much to let me have my firm?
Do you mean to imply that I'm simply here
on a mission to extort you?
Oh, we both know you're here to get my money
so you can split it with Jack Soloff.
I resent that you think so little of me.
You saying that's not why you're here?
I'm saying I don't give a shit
about your money or Jack Soloff.
I want a piece of you.
Get your Goddamn hands off that.
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey. Relax.
I didn't come here to put my gentle hands
on your precious balls.
I came here to take something far more valuable.
'Cause what I want is that piece of shit duck painting.
What?
That right there.
I was right.
If that didn't mean something to you, you would have
jumped right out of your chair and said okay to me.
Stemple, listen--
Not to mention,
you've had that thing as long as I've known you,
and there's no way a guy like you has a painting like that
unless it means everything to him.
How much money, Stemple?
Because you are not getting that painting.
$10 million.
Elliott.
15 million.
Goddamn it.
20 million. Do you want to keep going?
Or have you had enough? Because in ten seconds,
I am walking out of here with $20 million
or that thing in my hands.
Or tomorrow morning, I'm putting your firm in the ground.
Take the painting.
I know you don't trust me, but look who's headed this way.
On top of that, people are leaving.
You should leave, too.
No. That's what he wants.
He wants me to go somewhere
where those guards don't have a view of me.
And for all I know, he sent you to help him.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Leave me alone.
Hey there, Mike.
What you reading? "Outliers"?
I don't know what you think is gonna happen here, Frank,
but I'm not gonna let you trick me into leaving this room.
I don't need to trick you. This room will do just fine.
Oh, yeah? Why don't you tell that
to the two guards sitting behind me?
You mean the ones who let me into your cell?
They took a little cigarette break, Mike.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
So that's it?
You're gonna let these guys kill me?
Who said anything about killing you?
We're just gonna hurt you a little, or a lot.
No, no, no, no, no. What I meant was,
are you really too much of a pussy to take me on by yourself?
You think they won't come at you
just because you called me out?
Oh, no, I think that men respond to leaders.
And if you're too afraid to take on a guy like me,
you're not gonna be a leader for much longer.
Okay, tough guy.
You want me one-on-one, you got it.
One little thing: I'm gonna use this
and they're gonna hold you.
No, no, no!
What's going on here?
Huh? What? Nothing.
You have the same story?
Yeah.
Yeah, nothing's going on here.
Then why don't you three get away from him,
and go to your cells?
And I don't want to see you back in here
for the rest of the night.
I just saw Stemple walking out of here...
with a canvas that looks about the same size
as that empty space on your wall.
He won't be back.
So it's done?
It's done.
Harvey?
I remember you told me that painting
was the one happy memory you had of your mother before--
Like I said, Jessica,
I was the one who got us into this mess.
I'm the one who needed to get us out of it.
It's done.
Thank God.
So, you want to go get Harvey?
Have a drink and celebrate?
Harvey needs to be alone right now, Louis.
How about you and me?
I would,
but there's something I need to take care of.
I understand.
Louis, you had the right idea.
The wrong execution.
What do you mean?
I mean, if we're going to look like a real firm,
then starting tomorrow, we need to do something
about subletting these offices.
I'll take care of it.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Why'd you come back with the guard?
Now Gallo knows it was you.
He would have found out it was me anyway.
But I might not have.
I didn't do it to get you to forgive me.
I did it 'cause I never should have
let him in here in the first place.
What?
I just realized that I don't even know your name.
Kevin.
Kevin Miller.
Mike Ross.
Thank you, Kevin.
Lights out, gentlemen.
Robert, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, what do you need?
I just found out I'm not going to be able
to buy in as a partner.
What?
I don't have the money.
And I was wondering--
I don't need a 50-year-old associate, Jack.
I know that.
If you could just let me pay it off out of my salary.
You know as well as I do,if I let you do that
I might as well waive to buy in for everyone
Please,Robert.
Why can't you get a loan for it?
He can, but it's gonna be a little complicated.
but it's gonna be a little complicated.
Because I'm actually loaning you this money.
And you're gonna loan it to him,
and if nobody ever repays anybody,
nobody's gonna give a shit.
Why are you doing this,Jessica?
Because I'm the one that got you into this mess.
I should be the one to get you out.
Thank you.
The truth is, Jack,
the older I get,
the more I'd rather have friends out there
than enemies.
