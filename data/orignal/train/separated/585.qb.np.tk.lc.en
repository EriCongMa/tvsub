this is a historical day of greendale .
this state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art subway sandwichery in our cafetorium
represents greendale &apos;s first steps forward
into the realm of the legitimate !
oh , oh . no problem . you know what ?
i &apos;m just going to get it started with my teeth .
the legitimate ! oh . the legitimate !
that should be my sandwich shop .
it was my idea to put one there .
we &apos;re here for you , shirley .
yeah .
troy , annie , and i know what it &apos;s like to be displaced .
they &apos;re tenting our building for termites ,
so we &apos;re homeless .
i &apos;m staying in the sleep study lab .
all i have to do is wake up every three hours and go--
and i get two credits .
yeah , and we &apos;re going to build
a super awesome pillow fort here at the school .
another pillow fort ?
kind of repeating yourselves , aren &apos;t you ?
that was a blanket fort . this will be a pillow fort .
way more difficult , way better .
all difficult things are better , like carrying a disease
or holding in a fart right now .
i just found out how shirley and i are going to take down subway .
oh , how ?
dean ?
i assume you &apos;re familiar with the greendale bylaws .
i am not .
shirley , you do the honors .
my brain starts getting weird this time of night .
it &apos;s 10 : 00 am .
you &apos;re welcome .
&quot; any business operating for profit on greendale &apos;s campus
must be at least 51 % owned by a registered greendale student &quot; !
that &apos;s too bad , dean .
i don &apos;t recall seeing subway
in my premenopausal , postfeminist experiential marketing class .
actually , i &apos;m on the wait list
for the premen / postfem / ex mark .
who are you ?
gang , meet greendale &apos;s newest student , subway .
your name is subway ?
yep , using a groundbreaking but surprisingly legal process
known as corpohumanization , real people such as myself
are now allowed to represent the collective humanity
of business owners .
i have contractually waived my birth identity
and am now a man and student named ...
subway .
i don &apos;t believe this .
come on , subway , there is no way you &apos;re 5 &apos; 10 . &quot;
so you can vote ?
actually , no , because technically i &apos;m only a week old .
but please don &apos;t think of me
as any less human than yourselves .
i &apos;m here to hang out , take weird classes ,
and party as hearty as my morality clause allows .
eat fresh ? eat fresh ?
eat fresh .
that &apos;s my man .
wow , did you know greendale students
are technically in the army reserves ?
let &apos;s say a little prayer for peace .
第三季第十三集
annie , you &apos;ve got to get me into this sleep lab .
i can &apos;t think of a better use of my time here
than being unconscious .
it &apos;s not a blowoff class , jeff .
we &apos;re only allowed to bring one stuffed animal .
i &apos;m bringing ruthie ...
but using her pouch to sneak nathan .
well , have fun .
wait , since when do we have lockers ?
uh , since registration day , 2009 .
jeff , did you skip the preorientation freshman welcome
seminar and diversity fire circle ?
this explains so much about you .
are you saying i &apos;ve had a locker here for 2.1 / 2 years ?
&quot; halloween dance . &quot; &quot; post @-@ halloween dance . &quot;
&quot; dance contest . &quot;
&quot; contest dance . &quot; oh , come on .
what &apos;s this ? &quot; save garrett &quot; ? what &apos;s wrong with garrett ?
nothing now . we saved him .
wait , that &apos;s &quot; saved &quot; garrett ?
ooh , what &apos;s this ? love letter ?
oh , it &apos;s probably one of many .
oh , no . this is a hate letter .
what ? let me see that .
&quot; dear jeff , this might come as a shock
&quot; to someone who thinks he &apos;s god &apos;s gift to the world ,
&quot; but you &apos;re actually an inconsiderate jerk .
kim . &quot;
&quot; inconsiderate &quot; ?
who &apos;s kim ?
i don &apos;t know , and clearly she doesn &apos;t know me .
gesundheit .
i didn &apos;t sneeze .
look at these idiots .
cattle , sheep ...
other animals that travel in herds .
i want to say snakes .
am i the only person enraged by the fact
that corporations are taking human form ?
i totally predicted this in my high school newspaper column
&quot; britta unfiltered . &quot;
unfiltered . i get it .
get what ?
actually , maybe subway taking human form could be its undoing .
uh , britta ...
you &apos;re a , uh , progressive woman
of a more ... liberated looseness .
you could get close to subway and find out some dirt on him .
corporate espionage . i like it .
microphones hidden in lipstick .
lipstick hidden in microphones .
and the deadliest weapon of them all--
the penis flytrap .
okay !
this conversation is over .
i am not a whore , and not that i &apos;ve done the math ,
but if i were , i &apos;d be the super classy kind
that gets flown to dubai to stay in an underwater hotel .
abed , troy .
ah , don &apos;t worry , dean .
we have all the proper permits right here .
oh , silly me !
this is a coupon for 20 % off at bed bath &amp; beyond .
no need to bribe me , troy . actually--
there &apos;s plenty more where that came from .
look , i was just googling record lengths of stuff ,
and apparently there &apos;s a guinness world record
for the biggest pillow-- or blanket--fort .
so you boys-- you should go for it .
put this school on the map .
we &apos;d have a better chance of setting the record
if we made this a blanket fort , you know , take less time .
we wanted to make a pillow fort .
i don &apos;t want to sacrifice quality for square footage .
we don &apos;t need a world record to tell us we did something cool .
but if we won , we might meet that dude
with the curly fingernails .
shridhar chillal ? not interested .
i saw him on a talk show . he came off as pretentious .
i &apos;m going to go get a drink .
okay .
troy barnes .
vice dean laybourne .
you have a beard ...
and a ponytail .
going through some stuff right now , troy .
don &apos;t worry about it .
any chance you &apos;ve given a second thought to joining
my air conditioning repair school ?
sorry .
kind of busy at the moment doing some awesome work with abed .
ah , yeah , abed .
you guys watch that television show together , don &apos;t you ?
inspector spacetime .
funny , troy .
you and abed have always reminded me
of the inspector and his trusty constable reggie .
cool !
the inspector , of course , is smart , decisive ,
and reggie is--
well , he &apos;s reggie .
reggie is trained in zero @-@ gravity martial arts
and has a whistle .
yeah .
but he never really gets to blow the whistle
unless the inspector says it &apos;s okay .
less of a friendship , more of a self @-@ centered nerd
and his naive , obedient lapdog .
well , i got a thing .
you take care .
well , according to the office , this is the locker
of the only kim i &apos;ve had any class with since 2009 .
wonder what you did to make her so mad .
maybe the two of you made out , and then you forgot about her .
annie , that &apos;s what you think of me ?
i don &apos;t make out with forgettable women .
can i help you ?
we &apos;re looking for kim mcfadden .
this is her locker , right ?
are you serious ?
she slipped a note into my locker a couple years ago .
i guess i pissed her off somehow .
i &apos;m hoping to apologize .
that might not be easy .
kim &apos;s no longer with us .
she died two weeks ago .
what ?
sorry to drop that on you and run ,
but there &apos;s a rally for garrett .
but we saved him .
did we ?
what do you recommend ?
what &apos;s it to you , meat pusher ?
sounds like you might be a vegetarian .
you should try subway &apos;s veggie delite .
you should try reading orwell &apos;s 1984 .
i have . it &apos;s a great book .
it really awakened me in high school .
i think kids should be forced to read it .
me too . anyway , you &apos;re living it .
you &apos;re a human puppet with big sandwich &apos;s hand up your ass .
is this what you dreamt of being ?
unfortunately i &apos;m not allowed to discuss my former life
or engage in any nonplatonic relations ,
practice religion in public ,
or eat any nonfresh , unhealthy food like that
found anywhere outside subway .
why are you getting all that ?
i wanted to stand next to you for a moment .
it was worth it .
like a good book by orwell or a veggie delite .
is that you , subway ?
my eyesight ain &apos;t what it used to be .
eat these tater tots , harry .
for what it &apos;s worth , i think you might see more than all of us .
did you see him smiling at you ?
top @-@ notch whoresmanship , britta .
pierce .
sorry . whoreswomanship .
forgot it was the &apos; 90s .
anyway ... thank you , britta .
i knew we could count on you to help us take him down !
yep , that &apos;s me , the girl who &apos;s going to destroy
the big sandwich company with the dreamy eyes .
ooh ! we did it , pierce .
powerful passage , isn &apos;t it ?
&quot; she had become a physical necessity . &quot;
you circled this paragraph .
i can &apos;t say that i did .
i just think it &apos;s a striking expression of love &apos;s ability
to persevere within the cracks and
cogs of inhuman systems .
who were you , subway , before you were subway ?
i can &apos;t say .
i have to live within the rules .
this identity is my life .
if i do this for three more years ,
i can live a real dream .
well , at least tell me what that is .
i want to run a nonprofit shelter for handicapped animals .
dogs with wheels for hind legs .
deaf hamsters .
one @-@ eyed cats ?
well , they weren &apos;t on the top of my list , but sure .
i should go .
this is getting out of bounds for me .
eat fresh .
you should put the small ones in the middle ,
or the wall won &apos;t hold the ceiling .
why do i always have to be your reggie ?
what ?
i wanted to make a blanket fort ,
and you never even gave it a second thought .
i &apos;m not even your sidekick . i &apos;m your underkick .
i never said you couldn &apos;t do anything .
if you want to make a blanket fort , that &apos;s fine with me .
thank you .
just don &apos;t make it part of my pillow fort .
fine .
i &apos;ll start it somewhere else .
have fun stacking pillows like a baby .
jeff , are you okay ?
i &apos;m lying on campus furniture , so no .
is it about this kim girl ?
she is someone who died thinking i was a dick .
i can never apologize .
i can never change her mind .
that makes me a dick forever .
you think that &apos;s what an apology is ?
a spell you cast on another person to make them forgive you ?
apologies are opportunities to admit your own mistakes .
apologize to her locker .
but how can i apologize if i don &apos;t know what i did wrong ?
well , didn &apos;t she call you inconsiderate ?
sounds to me like you know exactly what you did wrong .
leonard , what are you doing ?
abed &apos;s fort needs pillows .
but i was going to lie there .
i was going to invest in ibm in 1952,
but life is full of disappointments .
eating fresh , are we ?
have you found any dirt on subway yet ?
no , nothing . i should probably hang out with him more .
you know what i think ?
i think you &apos;re falling for him .
i am not . who do you think i am ?
i lived in new york .
you never lived anywhere .
you &apos;re a weapon designed for sex .
you only think you lived in new york
&apos;cause i implanted your memories .
oh , pierce , stop it !
look what we &apos;re becoming .
i &apos;m sorry we pulled you into this dirty game .
i want you to stop .
yeah , we &apos;re pulling you out ...
right after your last assignment .
this pen is a microphone .
it &apos;s also a miniflask .
did you just drink ink ?
just plant this on subway ,
and you &apos;ll never have to see him again .
until then , keep him interested .
and for god &apos;s sakes , slap some life on those dead lips .
hello , abed . how &apos;s the pillow fort going ?
it &apos;s hard making something perfect , but it &apos;s worth it .
yeah , i &apos;ll remember that when i &apos;m being given a key
to the secret guinness record holders &apos; clubhouse ,
where i &apos;ll be hanging with those two fat guys on motorcycles
and being fitted for a beard of bees .
well , troy , i just got off the phone with guinness ,
and they are sending a representative
to have a look @-@ see at your blanket fort .
are we world @-@ record ready ?
garrett ?
we are still more than 2,000 square feet shy of the record .
abed &apos;s pillow fort is the only thing standing in our way .
well , what are we gonna do here , guys ?
is there a way we can connect them ?
you can &apos;t connect the blanket fort to the pillow fort
and still call it a pillow fort .
even if you could ,
i &apos;d rather see my work destroyed than compromise it .
great , abed will destroy his pillow fort ,
and troy will expand his blanket fort into the space .
everyone wins .
except abed , but you know , not everyone can win .
is that what you want , troy ?
for me to destroy my pillow fort so you could set your record ?
it is .
magnitude .
evacuate fort abed , and prepare for self @-@ destruct .
sir ?
do it .
we &apos;re done here .
pop , pop , captain .
oh ! subway .
britta , i was worried you wouldn &apos;t come .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about you .
they wanted me to plant a bug on you .
i can &apos;t , and i won &apos;t .
our values , our identities-- they mean nothing to me now .
only the primal remains .
to me , you are simply a physical necessity .
oh , subway .
subway .
oh , subway .
oh , subway .
oh , no , no .
no , this is wrong , pierce .
i just wanted to open a sandwich shop .
i did not sign up for this .
you don &apos;t want to get your hands dirty , fine .
i will .
nice knowing you , subway .
if that is your real name .
kim . it &apos;s me , jeff .
the inconsiderate jerk .
look , i don &apos;t remember hurting you ,
and i have to assume that &apos;s what hurt you .
god knows what crime you &apos;ve committed
to deserve me disregarding you entirely .
but whatever your crime ,
i think we both know the real crime is mine .
i &apos;m a self @-@ centered , shallow jackass .
and i just want to ... thank you for your note
because i &apos;m going to try and change .
i just wish you were here to forgive me .
i am .
and i do .
i &apos;m kim .
what ?
you said kim was dead .
because you never remember who i am .
first year , we hung out , like , ten times .
and each time , you introduced yourself to me .
that &apos;s why i wrote that note .
and then today , it &apos;s like you still don &apos;t remember me .
and--and you still assume from my name that i am a girl .
i had no choice but to make up that
awesome story about a dead chick
to hurt you like you hurt me .
i am so sorry ...
kim . right ?
do you know how long i &apos;ve waited to hear you say that ?
what the hell is this crap ?
annie , this is kim .
i think because he had a girl &apos;s name ,
i never took him seriously .
it happens literally all the time ,
which is insane because 16 % of all people named kim are men .
i &apos;m sorry , buddy .
don &apos;t apologize to this guy .
you told me to apologize .
to a dead girl &apos;s locker .
i thought i was representing the sisterhood .
thought i was teaching you a lesson
about all the girls you dominate and then ignore .
not to waste your energy on some weird , cloying ,
hypersensitive stalker with a girl &apos;s name .
hey ! you are really mean .
put it in a letter , jane austen .
prepare to initiate protocol omega .
good @-@ bye , pillow fort . you were a beautiful dream .
more than a dream . it &apos;s here .
who are you ?
someone who understands dedication
to craftsmanship in the face of mediocrity .
this world is run by the unremarkables .
don &apos;t do what you always do , abed .
don &apos;t corrupt the host to pacify the parasites .
ask yourself ,
&quot; what if i stopped worrying about their acceptance of me ? &quot;
what if it fell to the reggies of the world
to keep up with the inspectors or perish ?
now please turn your head while i crawl away .
i &apos;m going through some stuff right now .
i &apos;m very insecure .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;ll ask the questions here .
you had sex with subway , and i recorded it .
you know what , i &apos;m going to let this one slide .
what ?
what ?
i know we have very strict rules
against romantic entanglements with our corpohumanoids ,
but at this point in time ,
we can &apos;t stop them from having hearts .
these two are clearly in love .
if they want to express that love
in a perfectly healthy way , then--okay , hold on .
th--is this what i think it is ?
that got unhealthy real quick .
that--okay , that &apos;s-- yeah , that &apos;s weird .
that is well out of the mainstream .
you know , i was raised in the--
the bay area , but i-- i &apos;m a father now .
subway cannot stand for that , and frankly , rick ,
i @-@ i &apos;m surprised you did .
my name is subway .
not anymore .
the bread is stale .
no ! no !
oh , my god .
you !
subway , i love you !
britta !
shut up .
how could you ?
well , if that &apos;ll be all ,
i &apos;ll be on my way .
if someone could hand me my jacket .
it &apos;s right over there on the coatrack next to the door .
if somebody could just hand it to me , that would be great .
i guess i &apos;m confused .
why don &apos;t you just grab it on your way out the door--
you know what ? now i &apos;m not leaving .
now i &apos;m just going to sit for a while
and focus on how unacceptable today was .
jeff .
i wanted to apologize .
i never realized i had my own issues regarding gender roles ,
and it was certainly unfair of me to take them out on kim .
who &apos;s kim ?
corporate america has destroyed love .
again ?
subway !
oh , i &apos;m sorry , i thought you were someone else .
britta , you silly . it is me , subway .
what ?
i had a great time with you last night in the pillow fort ,
the one exception being the deviant sex act
you initiated without my consent .
eat fresh .
there is a situation developing in the study room .
i would elaborate , but i am out of breath
because i walked here very briskly .
calm down !
calm !
down !
what &apos;s going on here ?
abed won &apos;t tear down his fort .
i shouldn &apos;t have to compromise my craftsmanship
to placate mediocrity .
mediocrity ?
okay , b-- boys , boys .
the guinness rep will be here in two days .
can we just flip a coin to decide who has to back down ?
no .
no .
well , i &apos;m dean , so i &apos;m making the call .
the pillow fort comes down .
all right , you stay back .
watch it , star @-@ burns .
my name is alex !
this is war !
back , back .
back .
go .
back , back , back in the fort .
to be continued .
sir , it appears that troy barnes &apos; blanket fort
may go to war with abed nadir &apos;s pillow fort .
of course .
soon troy and abed will be torn asunder ,
and an unencumbered troy will turn to his destiny ...
the air conditioning repair school .
you are a cold @-@ blooded man , sir .
yes .
how unfortunate for troy and abed ...
see you at band practise .
