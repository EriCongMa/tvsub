第一季 第十一集
so when can we go public ?
my kids have to know first .
my friend vanessa--she moved away to vermont last year ,
and now she &apos;s back. you guys just have everything in common ,
and , um , i &apos;m just getting to know him .
this thing between us-- it &apos;s over fogood .
nate is a gentleman. he would never cause a scene .
where to , mr . bass ? the airport .
and who am i ?
that &apos;s a secret i &apos;ll never tell .
you know you love me .
hey , upper east siders. it &apos;s christmas in new york ,
and along with the season
comes the constance billard / st. jude &apos;s bazaar ,
where the only thing bizarre are the donated items for sale .
how about an antique butter churn ?
oh , my gosh. that would go so well with my loom .
i know what i &apos;m getting you for christmas now. all right .
oh , for when i move to siberia ?
no. come on. new york hardly even gets cold anymore ,
and it never snows. who wants chestnuts
roasted on an open fire when it feels like florida ? okay ,
global warming grinch .
i &apos;m just saying , christmas should be white and snowy .
i &apos;d even settle for manhattan slush. mm .
there you are .
hey , vanessa. what are you doing here ? hey .
merry christmas. this is a copy of &quot; the new yorker . &quot;
thank you , but you know i already have a subscription .
there &apos;s something else in there--a letter .
what does it say , serena ?
&quot; dear mr . humphrey , we are pleased to advise you
&quot; that we would like to publish your short story
in our summer fiction issue featuring &apos; 20 under 20 . &apos; &quot;
it &apos;s a contest for young unknown writers , and i might have ...
oh , my god ! submitted you .
i &apos;m gonna be published in &quot; the new yorker . &quot; that--oh .
this ca--this can &apos;t be real. is--is this--is this real ? this is so great .
i haven &apos;t even read one of your stories. oh , don &apos;t worry .
he doesn &apos;t show them to anyone .
i swiped this one out of his drawer on the pretense
of borrowing a stapler .
of borrowing slick. you never did return that stapler ,
by the way .
let &apos;s see. you story is called &quot; 10 @-@ 8 @-@ 05 . &quot;
what &apos;s that date ?
vanessa , thank you . i don &apos;t know how you did this ,
but this is the best present ever .
i can &apos;t believe we just took a cab for $ 32 .
well , i can &apos;t believe you were gonna wait an hour
for another subway. they said another train was on its way .
uh , excuse me. pardon me. oh .
oh . rufus , alison , hello .
hi .
oh , rufus .
uh , you remember my friend bartholomew bass ?
hi. from , uh , eleanor &apos;s ? yeah. hello .
eleanor &apos;s ? oh , this is my wife alison .
hi. how do you do ?
well , it &apos;s lovely to see you both .
excuse us , please .
i guess lily &apos;s targeted her next billionaire .
actually , i think she &apos;s had him in her sights for a while .
well , that was awkward. it wouldn &apos;t be
if you let people know what we were doing together .
i &apos;m just starting to trust you again .
and the only reason you didn &apos;t trust me last time
was because of a misunderstanding. yes , and to avoid another one ,
please understand
that if it doesn &apos;t work out between us again ,
i &apos;m gonna feel twice as humiliated .
not telling people about us ensures that we don &apos;t work out .
look , when i committed myself to you , i meant it .
you know i am in love with you .
what are you waiting for ?
blair .
oh , happy holidays .
happy holidays--mwah-- ms . van der woodsen .
mr. bass , i didn &apos;t think that you were still in town .
i figured that you were with ... with charles ? no. sadly ,
i am stuck here on business
while he suns himself at my hotel in monaco .
i have my staff keeping an eye on him ,
and i &apos;ll join him for new year &apos;s .
oh , right. i @-@ i , uh , was wondering
why he &apos;d been so quiet , and monaco answers my question .
yeah .
lovely to see you two. bye. you , too .
blair , there you are .
i @-@ i can &apos;t talk right now , serena . i &apos;m late ,
and i have-- a huge sweet tooth ?
they &apos;re for my dad and me. we get them every year ,
and he landed om parar 27 minutes ago. oh , then vite , vite !
i &apos;ll parle while you marche .
come on . i said vite !
nice holiday spirit , scrooge !
oh , gosh. so it &apos;s gonna be a real waldorf christmas ?
well , a real waldorf christmas eve .
eleanor drew the line at christmas day .
that &apos;s only for me , her and dorota. well ,
you still have a couple days with your dad .
no , it &apos;ll be more than just a couple days .
i &apos;m gonna convince him to stay in new york. what about paris and roman ?
roman is a phase. my father belongs here with me .
he only left new york to ride out the scandal. oh !
time to come home , don &apos;t you think ?
hey , did you want to ask me something ? yes ,
a gift idea for dan now that vanessa got him
the most thoughtful dan @-@ like present ever .
why don &apos;t you just buy him a new outfit for cedric
and call it a day ? thank you for being totally not helpful at all .
see you tomorrow night .
bye .
blair @-@ bear !
oh ! oh , look at you .
mm. more beautiful than ever .
uh , sweetheart ,
you remember roman ?
blair .
you are still perfection .
delicate , yet full with flavor ,
like a macaron .
imagine my surprise when the elevator door opened
and out popped both of &apos; em .
well , i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d mind .
it &apos;s the perfect opportunity
for you two to get to know each another better .
absolutely. it &apos;s for you. oh , sweetheart , you remembered .
it , uh , our tradition .
that &apos;s for you .
merci , blair .
my pleasure .
my son , the writer .
published writer. yeah , you got your dream girl
and your story in &quot; the new yorker . &quot;
maybe you should just die now. that &apos;s true . i may have peaked .
this one is from the smiths .
&quot; season &apos;s greetings . &quot; that &apos;s very original .
their name &apos;s smith. they don &apos;t have to be original .
this one is from , uh , alex .
what ?
&quot; alison , meet--meet me on the 24th for-- &quot; no , dan .
and that &apos;s not a christmas card .
why is he writing to you ?
sending cards to the house ? asking to see you ?
i don &apos;t kn.w
guys , we &apos;re--we &apos;re still here. we can hear you .
rufus , it &apos;s over with alex , okay ?
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m home now with my family .
good .
let &apos;s all rewind and just pretend this never happened .
this is not gonna ruin our christmas. hmm ?
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re okay with this. who said i am okay with this ?
what am i supposed to do , make a scene ?
behave like some pathetic , scorned wife ? no .
roman does not even know how to ice @-@ skate .
can &apos;t you escort him out of the park on your way to the meeting ?
maybe drop him at a nail salon ?
i cannot bother myself trying to wrestle roman away from you .
i have to mentally prepare .
i am meeting with the c.e.o. of victoria &apos;s secret , after all .
victoria &apos;s secret ?
yes , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m designing a line
of retro @-@ chic sleepwear and lingerie
and i-- i &apos;m looking forward to the samples .
we &apos;re all very proud .
in fact , mom , why don &apos;t you tell roman all about it ? oh , yes .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;d be fascinated .
it &apos;s so good to have you here. well , it &apos;s good to be here .
now where &apos;s the handsome nate ? am i gonna see him tonight ? well ,
he &apos;s in connecticut with his mom .
he said he would try to catch a train
and make it to the party tonight. yeah , well , an eleanor waldorf soiree--
another new york institution that i miss .
you know , you don &apos;t have to miss any of it .
yeah , well , i wish that i could be in two places at once ,
my dear , but impossible. sorry .
you know that chateau near lyon that i told you about ?
mm @-@ hmm. roman and i bought it .
you bought that place ? yes .
and with roman ?
the house is flooded with light .
the fireplaces are big enough . i mean , you can walk into them .
the gardens are incroyable .
uh , pardon me . i &apos;m taking my niece skating ,
and i can &apos;t seem to locate the rink .
but it &apos;s-- it &apos;s right over there .
of course. the throng of children in mittens
should have tipped me off. thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
the handsome man was just flirting with you .
that &apos;s absurd. he was not flirting with me .
roman , it is going to be so dull for you to sit and watch them skate .
yes. why don &apos;t you go to the petting zoo
and feed the sheep ?
or why don &apos;t i join you on the rink ? it looks fun .
wonderful .
yes. super .
i &apos;ll get you skates. see you there .
super .
you &apos;re not autographing those
and selling them on ebay , are you ? no. no , no .
i &apos;m just checking out some of the previous publishees ,
and i &apos;m--i &apos;m in great company here. it &apos;s the new yorker . &quot;
v. , how can i top this ? i can &apos;t , really ,
unless i rig the oscars for one of your documentaries .
you got in on your own merit .
the only gift i gave you was to lick a stamp , and as for me ,
the annual dan humphrey christmas cd mix
is more than enough. all right , yeah .
what &apos;s in the bag ?
perfection .
look , i know it &apos;s not christmas yet , but open it , please .
i can &apos;t wait . i &apos;m too excited .
oh , my .
i noticed the other day that you don &apos;t wear a watch ,
and then it occurred to me it &apos;s because you don &apos;t have a watch ,
and you &apos;re gonna need one to be punctual for all the meetings
with editors and publishers now that you &apos;re a fancy
and apparently , self @-@ important writer .
you don &apos;t like it. you want the brown band .
no , no , no . i love the band . i love the whole thing .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s the most amazing watch i &apos;ve ever seen ,
but i can &apos;t accept this .
what ? oh , yes , you can .
look , it &apos;s more of a gift for me
because i had so much fun picking it out for you .
you have to .
serena , i buy a book for my dad every christmas .
i think the most elaborate gift i &apos;ve ever given
has been a pair of rubber boots from l.l. bean .
so then i overdid it ?
i think even your underdoing it
would be overdoing it .
look , um , let &apos;s--let &apos;s-- let &apos;s set some rules ,
maybe some helpful guidelines .
fine .
deadline ?
um , tomorrow morning .
price limit ?
50 bucks .
all right. may the best gift win .
if it &apos;s any help , i can tell you dan &apos;s favorite used book shop .
that &apos;s okay . i think i got it .
are you alex ? who are you ?
rufus humphrey .
unless you want to be carried out of here ,
you &apos;re gonna stay the hell away from my wife .
calm down now .
you sent a letter to my wife
at my house where my children live ?
whatever you had with her is over .
why don &apos;t you sit down ? she told you to leave her alone .
i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s not what she told me a couple days ago .
excuse me. you ...
you spoke to her ?
damn it. you can do it. you can do it .
look at all these children .
they &apos;re skating around fearlessly. come on .
they got a lot shorter way to fall . blair , will you help us here ?
we need you !
just a second. my laces came undone .
now here we go .
ready ? now go to blair. okay .
you can do it ! blair !
come give us a lesson .
spotted spinning at wollman rink--
the blair capades. all the grace of nancy kerrigan ,
but packing the punch of tonya harding .
pauvre roman .
va ?
are you all right ?
i &apos;m so clumsy. my foot got caught behind the skate .
oh. here. let me help you .
i cannot believe that daddy decided to stay with roman
instead of having tea at the carlyle with me .
the e.r. doctor said he would make a full recovery .
everything is ruined .
why wod you say that ? you and i had a marvelous time .
well , i &apos;m sorry , mother. it &apos;s just not the same .
i don &apos;t understand how that french fox stole my father
and your husband
and always seems to come off like a @-@ an innocent lamb .
roman was not always so innocent , you know .
really ? what &apos;s his story ?
mm , well , when i first met him ,
he was going out with this model named freddy ,
and freddy was a horrible scoundrel .
roman would actually be into somebody like that ?
into him ? he was--he was absolutely infatuated with him .
freddy had him under some kind of spell .
i was the one who got him to break out of it
and turn his life around. don &apos;t mention freddy to your father .
it is a sore subject. okay. what was freddy &apos;s last name ?
hey. where were you ?
i tried to call you , but your phone was off .
i kept your date for you with alex .
he &apos;s actually a pretty cool guy
other than the fact that he &apos;s in love with my wife .
he told me about your phone call .
he ... felt that i owed him an explanation ,
and he was right .
and you didn &apos;t tell me that because ...
because there was nothing to tell .
i told alex that i was back with my family
and to stop calling .
would you have come back ...
if jenny hadn &apos;t shown up to bring you ?
if i hadn &apos;t , would lily be here right now ?
i guess by turning our backs on these other people ,
we thought we could fix ourselves .
maybe other people aren &apos;t the problem .
maybe we changed .
and at what point do we admit
that no matter how much we want it or how hard we try ...
it &apos;sujt t not rking .
i know it &apos;s been maybe ten minutes since i last asked ,
but are you still sure you don &apos;t want to talk about it ?
dad said he didn &apos;t want to ruin christmas .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to do. hey , well ,
just in case you change your mind ...
you &apos;re here . i know .
okay. how about this ?
at least you know it &apos;s something serena doesn &apos;t have .
a year of cheese for $ 600 ? are these people kidding ?
i could buy a cow for that much money and make my own cheese .
you just said &quot; make my own cheese . &quot; that &apos;s disgusting .
i &apos;m never goaa findndhis gift for serena. yeah ,
and your gift needs to be especially good this year
to make up for the rest of her christmas. what do you mean ?
well , she &apos;s living in a hotel. you know , how homey can it be ?
it &apos;s not exactly festive .
eric told me they don &apos;t even allow trees .
leave a message , and i might listen .
chuck , you are not answering my calls ,
to torture me , i am sure , but please , for the love of god ,
do not tell anybody about us , okay ?
please ? please .
hey. you told me to come right away .
is everything all right ? yeah .
why aren &apos;t you with your dad ? uh ,
i need your log @-@ in for your agency &apos;s site
from your modeling days. my modeling days ?
i did one print ad for gap when i was 12 .
what , are you holding an open call or something ?
i have one specific look in mind .
uh , okay , well i don &apos;t know
if it &apos;ll still even be in here , but ...
well , look at that .
addresses and phone numbers. perfect .
you know , i called you an hour ago. b.t.w. , you &apos;re late .
um , you &apos;re lucky i &apos;m even here at all .
it &apos;s christmas eve , and i still haven &apos;t found a gift for dan .
now all the stores are closing , and i &apos;m totally screwed .
do you have any idea what you can buy
for under $ 50 these days ? i don &apos;t know .
a single entry at a mid @-@ priced restaurant ?
three @-@ quarters of a dvd box set ?
maybe a pair of wolford stockings .
oh , stockings. yes , great idea for dan .
blair , please , this is serious .
i don &apos;t know. why don &apos;t you buy him a gold money clip
from cartier , say it &apos;s $ 49.99 ? he won &apos;t know the difference .
what are you doing anyway ?
i &apos;m booking me a model .
i come to you hat in hand , tail betwe m my le
and off my high horse .
i spent the entire day searching for the perfect gift for dan .
now all the stores are closing , christmas day is looming ,
and , um ... i need your help .
i could take this opportunity to gloat ,
but i actually like you .
so let &apos;s get down to business. what do you have so far ?
um , i found a first edition j.l. hall book ,
original italian poster of the &quot; 400 blows &quot;
and a montblanc fountain pen. all very thoughtful .
and all exceed $ 50 .
right .
well , dan &apos;s not really that into things .
which makes shopping for him kind of hopeless .
the only thing he wants for christmas is snow .
it &apos;s not like i can give him that .
you sure ?
happy holidays .
welcome. welcome .
we &apos;re doing things a little untraditionally this year .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard .
i &apos;m desiining a ne of lingerie for victoria &apos;s secret .
i walked into the store , and i fell in love with this tree .
isn &apos;t that lipstick clever ? isn &apos;t it ?
good. have some eggnog .
hello ? hey. it &apos;s me .
hey. so , uh , running into each other at the school fair--
kind of awkward .
i suppose so , especially after our last phone call .
rufus , we really shouldn &apos;t be speaking .
no , i know .
but if there &apos;s something you want to say ,
you should go ahead and say it
is there something you want me to say ?
rufus ...
why are you calling ?
oh , i ...
just wanted to say merry christmas .
hope you have a good holiday .
yes , well ...
i &apos;m , um , flying to anguilla with bart tonight ,
so i &apos;m expecting it to be a @-@ a great holiday--
one for the ages , in fact .
good night , rufus. good @-@ bye .
anguilla .
what is the matter with me ?
i don &apos;t think so. oh .
oh. excuse me .
what are you doing here ? well , i was hoping to see you again .
i thought it great good fortune that roman tracked me down
at the skating rink and extended an invitation .
oh , well ...
en--enjoy the party .
how dare you invite a strange man into my home .
jack came ?
go talk to him .
bring vodka. roman ...
you practically picked him up off the street .
and then i googled him. his name is jack roth .
he owns a prominent hedge fund
with offices in london and barcelona ,
and he finds you very attractive .
well , that &apos;s no excuse ,
and--and--and i am doing just fine
without your romantic help .
are you ?
eleanor , we &apos;ve been friends for a long time ....
since before marc jacobs went into rehab .
friends don &apos;t steal other friends &apos; husbands .
is nate there ?
oh. a few hours ago ?
chuck bass didn &apos;t call for him , did he ?
uh , never mind. did nate say where he was going ?
no , no. don &apos;t--don disturbrb mrs . archibald .
um , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s on his way here now .
all right. thank you .
dorota &apos;s gonna kill you if you get glue on that comforter .
sorry we &apos;ve turned your room into an art studio , b . ,
but the clock is ticking .
i &apos;m done .
oh , my gosh .
wow. that--that &apos;s amazing .
thank you so much , vanessa. this is gonna be ... incredible .
good . i &apos;m glad i could help .
i think he &apos;ll really love it .
vanessa ?
i think i &apos;d like to help with this little project .
would you come and help me find another pair of scissors ?
it &apos;s so nice what you &apos;re doing for your friend dan ,
helping his girlfriend make his christmas present .
serena is so grateful
because she likes to see the best in people .
i like to see the truth .
yeah ? and what &apos;s that ?
i think you like dan a little too much .
just thought i should let you know
someone &apos;s watching .
merry christmas .
i &apos;m taking off. call me when you &apos;re done ?
okay. where you going ?
i &apos;m gonna go check on my daddy . i thought you were gonna help .
i think my work &apos;s done here. oh , hello .
hi. good @-@ bye. when you two are done hiding up here ,
i &apos;m taking you both out for dessert. can &apos;t , mom . i &apos;m busy .
but this is important for our family .
it &apos;ll just be the three of us. mom ,
anytime you say it &apos;ll just be the three of us ,
it means you &apos;re dating someone new. whoever it is ,
i don &apos;t care . i &apos;ll just meet him at the wedding. fine , fine .
then i will just tell you who it is ,
because you &apos;re gonna be seeing him around from now on .
it &apos;s bart bass . bart bass ?
mom , you cannot date bart bass .
you just said a moment ago you didn &apos;t care who it was .
that was before i knew who it was .
he only has one facial expression. he scares me .
and he raised chuck. that scares me .
oh , serena , as usual , you &apos;re being overly dramatic .
i &apos;m not marrying bart.
this is very casual ,
and regardless , i &apos;m not asking your permission .
you know when i suggested this plan ,
i didn &apos;t know that it would entail a robbery. hey , hey , hey .
i left a donation .
so it was more of a rescue than a robbery .
you know , those abandoned trees in that lot
were just gonna be kindling the day after christmas ,
and this tree that we have here is gonna be loved and admired .
oh , yeah , you have a real talent for spin , my brother. okay .
i wish i had more talent for heavy lifting. oh .
oh. yeah , well , what you &apos;re doing for serena is really romantic .
i wonder what mom and dad
are gettineach other for christmas .
i thought that if i got them under the same roof
that things would go back to the way they were .
they haven &apos;t , have they ?
i think there &apos;s a real possibility
that they might split up .
if i hadn &apos;t brought her back , though ,
we could &apos;ve just kept pretending
that she &apos;s just in hudson doing her art .
you did the right thing , jen .
really , you did , cause whatever happens now ,
at least , uh , we &apos;re not living in a fantasy , you know ?
wonderful party , eleanor .
so you ... ice @-@ skate ?
occasionally , with my niece ,
but she &apos;s much more talented than i am .
well , i haven &apos;t skated since ages ,
but i used to love it when i was a girl .
you must have been very beautiful out there on the ice .
excuse me .
merry christmas. merry christmas .
excuse me .
freddy , what on earth are you doing here ? oh , roman invited me .
what ?
freddy , what ... what are you doing here ?
he said that you invited him. what ?
freddy .
roman , explain this .
i can &apos;t .
and so true. how does one explain the indescribable pull
to see an old lover , to feel that jolt of electricity ?
so you couldn &apos;t last two days in town without contacting him ?
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d trust appearances and not me .
harold , dear , i-- roman did not invite freddy .
i think blair did .
blair ?
freddy ...
if you want to be the featured model in my spring catalog ,
you &apos;d better tell us the truth .
she might have offered to buy me a cruise ...
and renew my gym membership .
well , you might as well take that cruise ,
because you &apos;ll be featured in my catalog
when hell freezes over .
now please , get out. thanks for the champagne .
merry christmas .
looks like daddy &apos;s little girl
isn &apos;t sugar and spice and everything nice after all .
i wish you would just slow down for a second
and let her be. well , i just can &apos;t believe
that blair would do something so cruel ,
and roman , who &apos;s only ever been completely kind to her .
it isn &apos;t roman blair &apos;s lashing out at--it &apos;s you .
she was so looking forward to spending time with you alone ,
and then you show up at our doorstep with your lover ,
without a word of warning. how did you expect her to react ?
well , i hoped that once we were together ,
it would all work out .
i suppose that was pretty naive .
blair learned scheming from her mother
and unrealistic dreaming from her father .
she tries really hard to act all grown @-@ up ,
but don &apos;t you be fooled .
she &apos;s still a little girl who needs her daddy .
okay , stop , stop , stop. ow .
okay. what now ?
now you go in there ,
you distract dexter , the humorless concierge ... okay .
while i try and sneak this into an elevator. all right , um ,
who &apos;s gonna turn you into hercules
so you can carry this thing by yourself ?
i did--i did not say the pl was foolproof .
hey , ms . van der woods-- lily , hi .
dan . jenny. tree. hi .
yeah , um , they don &apos;t allow christmas trees inside ,
which is why we &apos;re out here .
which is why dan &apos;s about to ask you for a favor .
ah , does it involve distracting dexter
and sneaking into the elevator ? why ? would that work ?
no. never. he has the eyes of a hawk ,
and he takes his job very seriously .
so i &apos;ve noticed .
but bobby at the service entrance--
i think he could be bought .
come .
i just sent him a text , and dan &apos;s on his way .
thank you so much. it &apos;s really no problem ,
and since there are no problems , i should go .
oh , no , no , no. stay , please .
you don &apos;t need me. we talked about how to turn everything on .
no , i know i can do it , but i just want you to see dan &apos;s face .
i &apos;ve really gotta get going. okay. well , i &apos;ll tell him how much you did .
please don &apos;t. it &apos;s your present .
just ... enjoy your night .
hey , this is nate . i can &apos;t come to the ph--
can i come in ?
our flight leaves in a few hours .
i wanted to say good @-@ bye .
please forgive me , blair .
i should have told you that i was bringing roman .
i knew that having him here would be hard for you ,
but i love you so much , and i love roman ,
and i was hoping that if we were all thrown together ,
that something ... perfect would happen
and that you would love him , too .
i was gonna convince you to move back to new york ,
but you bought a vineyard
in france with roman .
what &apos;s next , a commitment ceremony ?
great .
there &apos;s no room in your life for me anymore .
sweetheart , there is always room for you .
no matter where i am , no matter who i &apos;m with .
i , uh ...
this is part of your christmas gift .
yourouse in france .
it &apos;s very nice , daddy .
i &apos;m sure you and roman will totally enjoy it .
and so will you ,
because this ...
is your room .
it &apos;s beautiful .
we &apos;re having it decorated just for you .
a cat .
a cat named &quot; cat , &quot;
like in your favorite movie .
it was roman &apos;s idea .
so ... merry christmas , sweetheart .
we &apos;re hoping that you &apos;ll spend the whole summer with us .
merry christmas .

to a birthday party where i met a girl .
she only spoke two sentences to me ,
but i &apos;ve never forgotten her .
wait. your story &apos;s about me ?

the arts and crafts were impressive ,
but how did you manage the real snow ?
i &apos;m well @-@ connected .
this is , without question , the best christmas ever .
ever in the history of christmas .
i hate to break the spell ,
but , uh , we better get home before our families wake up .
eleanor ... hmm ?
you are a marvel .
oh , stop it. mmm .
who knew there were men like you
wandering around central park , lost ?
eleanor , good morning ,
and , jack , nice to see you. good morning .
yes , wonderful .
the flights were all canceled because of the weather .
i wanted to tell blair in person .

mom , your phone .
oh. uh , lily , you &apos;re not gonna want to interrupt this moment .
other presents come when you least expect em .
hey , lil. you know everything &apos;s closed on christmas ?
diners that claim to be open 24 / 7--
it &apos;s false advertising .
and everyone knows
the biggest present comes in the smallest box .
so , uh , alison &apos;s leaving .
she &apos;s spending time alone with the kids .
and i seem to have walked all the way from brooklyn
to your doorstep
without a jacket , in the snow .
so what the hell ?
i miss you ...
and i have been missing you for a while .
lily ...
would you do me the honor of being my wife ?
fromage ! cheese !
ah , perfect .

you wish you had never opened ...
