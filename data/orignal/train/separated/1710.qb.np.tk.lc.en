it &apos;s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores
instead of just downloading comics digitally .
it &apos;s probably for the best .
for a lot of these guys , the weekly trip here
is the only chance their mom has to go down
to the basement and change their sheets .
oh , that reminds me , i get fresh sheets tonight . yay .
well ?
what do you think of new comic book night ?
magic , huh ?
sheldon , i &apos;m disappointed .
as a brilliant man ,
you &apos;re entitled to a vice .
i could understand frequenting an opium den
or hunting your fellow man for sport .
but this ? lame @-@ o .
well , a ) comic books employ storytelling through sequential art ,
an medium that dates back 17,000 years
to the cave paintings of lascaux ,
and b ) you play the harp .
like that &apos;s cool .
can i help you find anything ?
a comic that depicts a woman whose bosom
can &apos;t be used as a flotation device .
sorry . most of the guys
who come in here like big boobs .
couple of them have big boobs .
the new warlords of ka &apos;a expansion pack is out .
a new one ? unbelievable .
they just keep making up more cheesy monsters ,
slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop .
it &apos;s like a secret tax on guys who can &apos;t get laid .
they &apos;re not even trying .
remember the satanimals pack with the hellephant ?
why , absurd .
what was he , a bad elephant who died and went to hell ?
what could an elephant possibly do
that would cause him eternal damnation ?
&quot; wild west and witches &quot; ?
what kind of loser cares about a showdown
between billy the kid and the white wizard of the north ?
a total loser .
obviously , a guy with a six @-@ shooter
beats an old man with a magic wand .
well , h @-@ hold on .
uh , what if the wizard casts
a helmet of confusion spell on billy the kid &apos;s cowboy hat ?
what ? please !
this is billy the kid we &apos;re talking about .
i mean , the wizard would get shot between the eyes
before he could ever get out the words ,
&quot; what the hell is billy the kid doing
in the mystic realm of ka &apos;a ? &quot;
leonard ...
what &apos;s the deal with sheldon &apos;s friend amy ?
are they a couple ?
couple of weirdos . why ?
you interested in amy ?
well , i mean , she didn &apos;t look through me
with soul @-@ sucking , ball @-@ shriveling
hatred and contempt .
i like that in a woman .
could you run it by sheldon if i could ask her out ?
sure . i guess .
stuart , settle an argument for us .
who would win ,
billy the kid or the white wizard ?
if i tell you that ,
i &apos;m robbing you of the hours of fun you could have
for the magical , rootin &apos; -tootin &apos; low price of $ 24.95 .
i &apos;ll take one .
mm ... make it two .
i hate all of you and myself . three .
i &apos;ll ring it up .
like shooting nerds in a barrel .
hey , can i talk to you about something ?
it &apos;s a little awkward .
i know what this is about .
given the professional standstill you &apos;re at ,
you &apos;re wondering if this is the appropriate time
to abandon your research and focus on teaching .
yes .
and if i may suggest ,
consider changing disciplines .
yeah , to the humanities-- perhaps history .
one of the advantages of teaching history
is that you don &apos;t have to create things .
you know , you just have to remember stuff that happened
and then parrot it back .
you could have fun with that .
yeah , that &apos;s not it .
stuart &apos;s kind of interested in amy .
oh , of course he is . she &apos;s very interesting .
did you know , when she was 14,
she severed the webbing between her own toes ?
no .
he wanted me to find out
if you &apos;d have a problem with him asking her out .
i &apos;m not sure how to respond , leonard .
i don &apos;t own amy .
can &apos;t own a person .
at least not since ...
1863 .
president lincoln freed the ...
slaves ! come on , leonard ,
if you &apos;re going to teach history ,
these are the kind of facts you &apos;ll have to know .
you know what ? never mind .
i &apos;m going to tell him it &apos;s okay to ask her out .
the question is moot .
there is no way that stuart ,
an impoverished peddler of picture books ,
would be at all appealing to amy farrah fowler ,
a noted neurobiologist
capable of performing surgery on her own feet
with nothing but nitrous oxide
from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia .
all right , but for the record ,
i checked in with you to see how you &apos;d feel about it .
fine . the record shall so reflect .
now , getting back to the problem at hand ,
what to do with a washed @-@ up experimental physicist ...
i am not washed @-@ up .
oh , leonard .
lots of people love you and want to help you ,
but they can &apos;t until you admit the problem .
well , ladies , we killed the bottle .
i had half a glass .
i didn &apos;t have any .
okay , don &apos;t judge me .
so , what do you want to do--
go to the movies , go dancing , lay down for a little bit ?
or we play ... travel twister .
amy , really ? twister ?
excuse me . i &apos;ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game .
and i &apos;m sure it &apos;s a lot more exciting
when you play with other people .
what do you say , bestie ? we can do shirts and skins .
i &apos;m shirts . called it .
i &apos;m too small for twister .
and roller coasters .
and sitting with my feet on the floor .
hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes , mom .
hey , you know , my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me ,
and i turned out just fine .
hey , look , i have peach schnapps .
thank god .
guys , something happened .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i think a boy likes me .
&quot; hi . it &apos;s stuart .
&quot; we met at the comic book store .
&quot; i was wondering if you &apos;d like to get coffee sometime .
&quot; it &apos;s okay if you say no .
&quot; it might be the kick in the pants i need
to start taking zoloft . &quot;
amy , little vixen .
just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester .
what are you going to do ?
doesn &apos;t he know you have a boyfriend ?
oh , she doesn &apos;t have a boyfriend ;
she has a sheldon .
so do you like stuart ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s nice .
he &apos;s funny .
he has the sallow , drawn countenance
associated with an overactive thyroid gland .
that &apos;s kind of hot .
okay , look , sweetie , we all love sheldon ,
but you &apos;ve been with him over a year now .
if it &apos;s not going anywhere ,
what does it hurt to look around ?
well , yeah , i guess they &apos;re not engaged like me and howie .
yeah , for what it &apos;s worth ,
engaged people can look around , too .
lot of options out there .
where &apos;s stuart ?
out .
who are you ?
i &apos;m dale .
he left me in charge .
really ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t get it , either .
i want to return this
&quot; wild west and witches ka &apos;a &quot; expansion pack .
sorry . i don &apos;t do returns .
they &apos;re hard .
sure , sure .
uh , when will stuart be back ?
i don &apos;t know . he went out for coffee .
with a girl .
oh , i guess i was wrong .
you okay ?
am i okay ?
leonard , i &apos;m on a lifelong trajectory
that includes a nobel prize and cities named after me ,
all four wisdom teeth
fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction ,
and my bowel movements run like a german train schedule .
am i okay ?
i &apos;m okay , too !
wild bill witchcock .
a tribe of abra @-@ comanches .
flaming spittoon .
and for the record ,
i &apos;m very disappointed in you cowpokes .
we &apos;re playing our inaugural round of &quot; wild west and witches &quot; ,
and i &apos;m the only one
who bothered to dress for the occasion .
patooie .
we &apos;re not wearing cowboy hats , sheldon .
it looks ridiculous .
and i suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous , too ?
yeah .
very .
incredibly so .
did it look ridiculous when we got the satanimals pack
and i dressed up as a beelzebobcat ?
yeah .
very .
incredibly so .
all right , fine . let &apos;s just play .
we should go easy on him .
amy &apos;s out with stuart tonight .
wait a minute .
are you telling me that sheldon &apos;s patented blend
of condescension and no sex
isn &apos;t enough to hold on to a woman ?
cluck , cluck , cluck .
what are we , ladies at a quilting bee ?
or are we men playing a fantasy card game
set in a magical frontier town ?
sorry .
creepy tepee .
annie ogly .
hocus pocus pocahontas .
and may i point out it is the three of you
who are obsessed with stuart and amy , not me .
i think you need to ask yourselves
who &apos;s really being ridiculous here .
it &apos;s you .
you are .
totally you .
hey , guys , check it out .
the deluxe limited edition &quot; wild west and witches &quot;
expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector &apos;s tin .
come on , no !
we just bought the regular pack .
ooh , a sheriff &apos;s badge .
yeah , it &apos;s also a wand .
with a hologram ? nice !
hey , do you see this ?
i &apos;m in the matrix , leonard ; i see everything .
you got to be kidding me .
you friended stuart on facebook ?
i thought you didn &apos;t like facebook anymore .
don &apos;t be silly .
i &apos;m a fan of anything that tries to
replace actual human contact .
please .
you &apos;re looking at facebook to find out how their date went .
really ?
you think i care if a man , what ,
&quot; shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady &quot; ?
you &apos;re so full of it .
you are free to believe whatever you like .
and unfriend rajesh koothrappali .
you unfriended me ? seriously ?
oh , yeah .
now he &apos;s gonna miss all those great updates like ,
&quot; i can &apos;t believe i waited this long
to make my own potpourri &quot;
sheldon , why don &apos;t you just acknowledge
that you have feelings for amy
and you don &apos;t want her going out with other men ?
and unfriend leonard hofstadter .
here &apos;s a radical thought .
go old @-@ school , challenge stuart to a fight .
i mean , nothing makes the ladies hotter
than two skinny white guys
swatting at each other with their eyes closed .
and unfriend howard wolowitz .
that &apos;s all of us .
can i use the laptop ?
why ?
i have to buy that stupid collector &apos;s tin .
who do we love ?
penny .
who do we love ?
penny .
who do we love ?
penny .
hello , sheldon .
come on in .
thank you .
what &apos;s up ?
i came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
a date .
you and me .
dining , dancing ,
perhaps you &apos;d like to take in a prizefight .
god , are you trying to make amy jealous ?
no .
why is everyone so obsessed with amy and stuart ?
whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes
or intercourse tonight .
okay , listen to me .
playing games is not gonna help get amy back .
i am not trying to get her back .
but , out of curiosity , what is a way ?
all right , honey , let me tell you a story .
there was a guy i liked , and i never told him how i felt .
eventually , he started going out with someone else ,
and i always regretted it .
do you see where i &apos;m going with this ?
i believe i do .
i &apos;m the guy .
you &apos;re not the guy .
are you sure ?
that would explain so much .
your constant presence in my apartment ,
that baffling dalliance with leonard just to be near me ,
the way you call me &quot; sweetie &quot; all the time .
i call everyone &quot; sweetie . &quot;
you tramp .
look , sheldon , all i &apos;m saying is
strap on a pair and go talk to amy .
&quot; strap on a pair &quot; ?
of what , skates ?
oh , sweetie , you are so not the guy .
if you &apos;re bored , you can go .
i understand .
no , i &apos;m having a nice time .
don &apos;t patronize me .
excuse me . excuse me .
pardon me .
pardon me . excuse me .
hi , stuart .
hi , sheldon .
pardon me ... excuse me ...
sheldon , what are you doing here ?
the thought of you sitting in a darkened theater
with a character like stuart is repellent .
no offense , stuart .
none taken .
although &quot; repellent &quot; is kind of a ... kind of a strong word .
i &apos;m sorry this causes you discomfort ,
but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship ,
i can put myself in any repellent situation i want .
um , again ...
stuart , please . you &apos;re being rude .
anything else ?
i believe i would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship .
i &apos;m listening .
with the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever ,
physical or otherwise ,
i would not object to
us no longer characterizing you as &quot; not my girlfriend . &quot;
interesting .
now try it without the quadruple negative .
you &apos;re being impossible .
hi , stuart .
fine .
amy ...
will you be my girlfriend ?
yes .
well , that &apos;s enough of that .
sorry to interrupt .
you two enjoy your date .
here &apos;s a dollar for your troubles .
get yourself some sour patch kids .
excuse me ... excuse me ... pardon me ...
so , other than you taking your relationship
to the next level with another guy , this was nice .
yes , well , thanks for seeing me to my door .
oh , you &apos;re welcome .
amy . amy . amy .
let &apos;s wrap things up out there .
um , good night , stuart .
good night .
take the hint , stuart .
the lady said &quot; good night . &quot;
how did you get into my apartment ?
is that the kind of nagging i can expect
now that you &apos;re my girlfriend ?
good thing i drew this up .
what &apos;s that ?
i present to you the relationship agreement .
a binding covenant that , in its 31 pages ,
enumerates , iterates and codifies
the rights and responsibilities of sheldon lee cooper ,
here and after known as &quot; the boyfriend , &quot;
and amy farrah fowler ,
here and after known as &quot; the girlfriend &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s so romantic .
mutual indemnification always is .
why don &apos;t you start perusing while i set up my notary stamp .
&quot; section 5 : hand @-@ holding .
&quot; hand @-@ holding is only allowed
under the following circumstances .
&quot; a : either party is in danger of falling off a cliff ,
precipice or ledge ;
b : either party is deserving of a hearty handshake
after winning a nobel prize ;
c : moral support during flu shots &quot;
seems a bit restrictive .
feel free to retain a lawyer .
penny , i said &quot; right hand red . &quot;
yeah , i heard you .
i got red .
bernadette , left foot yellow .
we should play limbo next .
no one beats me at limbo .
penny . amy . bernadette .
that &apos;s my boyfriend .
it &apos;s open !
i got a splinter .
what do you want me to do about it ?
relationship agreement section 4 : boo @-@ boos and ouchies .
you have to take care of it .
i should &apos;ve gotten a lawyer .
looks like it &apos;s just us playing .
penny ?
penny , we &apos;re out of wine !
you should probably drive .
