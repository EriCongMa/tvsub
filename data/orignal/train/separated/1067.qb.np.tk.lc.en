this is a good office .
the one next door has a much nicer view .
they want me to run white collar division ?
consider it a stepping stone to d.c.
what &apos;s the gold for , hagen ?
why &apos;s that matter to you ?
because i can tell when i &apos;ve stepped into a trap .
you &apos;re gonna help set me free .
my new handler , is he in there ?
special agent david siegel .
neal caffrey is a confidence man .
he preys on trust , desire , and impressionability .
i &apos;m no lap dog , sir .
sure as hell fooled me .
well , i &apos;m hoping i fooled him too .
you were playing him .
i was handling him .
curtis hagen is back .
i guess an appellate court granted him a new trial .
think he has a chance ?
no .
all the proof of his guilt is upstairs .
hey , you paid the piper .
that &apos;s the end , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s just the beginning .
here you go , sir .
thank you .
i &apos;m disappointed in you , caffrey .
you &apos;re not a coffee fan ?
you &apos;re never gonna fit in in this city .
i saw by your anklet you were out front of midtown mutual here .
i was wondering if i was gonna see you at work .
i &apos;m reformed , agent siegel .
just a man trying to get his fix on the way to the office .
you &apos;re gonna waste a lot of time
keeping an eye this close on me .
i don &apos;t plan to .
i was looking for you &apos; cause i need your help .
why ? what &apos;s the case ?
i &apos;m looking for an apartment .
well , apartment hunting isn &apos;t
exactly my area of expertise .
but new york is .
i figure if anybody knows an area to move to ,
it &apos;d be you .
where you live in the city reflects who you are .
so who is agent david siegel ?
recently divorced .
figured you already know that
from some kind of tell i have , or--
phantom ring .
you start to play with it ,
then realize it &apos;s not there anymore .
yep , just like that .
that i do .
so i &apos;m a-- i &apos;m a man starting over .
what better place than new york , right ?
all right .
how do you feel about ironic eyewear ?
sad for humanity .
that rules out williamsburg and greenpoint .
gentrifying areas with a little danger ?
i prefer my danger to be work @-@ related .
no bushwick then . what &apos;s your price range ?
price doesn &apos;t matter .
it does in new york .
unless you &apos;re secretly rich .
you &apos;re secretly rich .
surprised neal caffrey .
i guess i &apos;m doing something right here .
it &apos;s easy then . greenwich village .
plenty of culture , central location .
and as a native of chicago ,
you will appreciate the best pizza in new york .
i &apos;ll check it out .
why &apos;d you choose where you live ?
it &apos;s in my radius .
right , right . yeah , radius .
are we talking hilton rich ?
hearst ?
do you own your own yacht ?
not in the office , caffrey .
i don &apos;t want anyone to know about it .
is that clear ?
all right , you want to give a con man a secret ?
you live a dangerous life , agent siegel .
god , the finger point again .
i &apos;ll get to work .
i guess that one &apos;s for me .
her name was stephanie .
what , your ex @-@ wife ?
my yacht .
i knew it .
all right .
i knew it .
you &apos;ve grown power @-@ hungry
with the pointy fingers , you know that , right ?
and please tell me you don &apos;t do it to elizabeth .
curtis hagen was granted early release from prison today .
and like his namesake , the dutchman
will probably disappear into the night again .
how &apos;d he get off ?
some evidence was damaged in the warehouse .
his lawyer saw an opening and took it .
takes me back .
look how far we &apos;ve come since that case .
you &apos;ve come .
excuse me ?
well , you &apos;re in hughes &apos;s office
with a well @-@ deserved promotion .
i &apos;m still on an anklet , just with somebody new
holding the leash .
you &apos;ve gone from an incarcerated con man
to an invaluable part of this fbi team .
that is nothing to sniff at .
hagen &apos;s free . i &apos;m not .
you &apos;re right .
he &apos;s free ...
for now .
he &apos;s a career criminal . he &apos;ll make a mistake .
and when he does , we &apos;ll catch him .
or at least you and siegel will .
we &apos;ll keep an eye out .
good .
30分钟后见
see you later , peter .
see you .
interesting choice for a meeting place .
are you deciding on your next forgery ?
i left that behind me , mr. caffrey .
prison changed me , as i &apos;m sure it did you .
it didn &apos;t , actually .
no , apparently not . what a pity .
i did what you asked .
hagen , you &apos;re free .
you did . it was a lovely start .
no . i &apos;m done .
it &apos;s over .
i &apos;m the one who decides when it &apos;s over , not you .
is that all you called me here for ?
to threaten me ?
not at all .
there &apos;s something here i want to steal .
and here i thought prison changed you .
it did .
no more forgery ,
no more getting my hands dirty .
you see , you &apos;re gonna steal it for me .
so you find me amusing ?
well , you realize you &apos;ve shot yourself
in the foot , right ?
i &apos;m on an anklet , which means the fbi knows i &apos;ve been here .
so if i boost this painting , they &apos;ll know it was me .
then i &apos;ll be back in jail and no good to you .
well , i suppose you &apos;re going to have
to be extra clever then , aren &apos;t you ?
at which , so far , you &apos;re failing .
i don &apos;t want this painting .
this karen kates is the most valuable piece
in the museum .
to some , perhaps .
the mosconi codex .
you want me to risk jail for a little light reading ?
this is no ordinary book .
and well worth that risk .
to you , maybe .
yes , to me .
and what &apos;s important to me
is now what &apos;s important to you .
you have 48 hours .
this book &apos;s binding is attached
to an a90 pressure plate .
if i move it an inch ,
this place is going to light up with alarms .
don &apos;t move it then .
i only need chapter 13 .
oh , great .
excuse me .
i &apos;d like to request a book for study .
i can get you an application .
which one would you like ?
the mosconi codex .
you and me both .
so , can i check out the codex or--
oh , uh , sorry .
i wish i could , but no one can check it out .
i mean , it can &apos;t even be opened .
a book that no one can open .
that &apos;s cruel .
i @-@ i agree .
and this one , the mosconi codex ,
it &apos;s a riddle ,
wrapped in an enigma ,
wrapped in a shatterproof glass box .
i mean , i would give my left arm
to peek inside it .
sorry . i @-@ i &apos;m rambling .
it &apos;s just the codex . it &apos;s a pet obsession of mine .
i respect a good obsession .
what makes it so valuable ?
well , so before he died , mosconi claimed
that the greatest wealth in the world
was within its pages .
oh , that &apos;s an easy thing to claim
for a book that no one can open .
that &apos;s true .
i mean , it could be the key to enlightenment
or a list of his favorite recipes .
why not take a look inside and find out ?
the owner gave strict instructions
in the lending that it can &apos;t be opened .
the owner . hmm . who is the owner ?
anonymous .
of course .
adds to the intrigue , doesn &apos;t it ?
so we &apos;re just left to judge a book by its cover .
so there &apos;s no way to find out what &apos;s inside ?
no way .
though mosconi did gild the first page
of every chapter ,
so we know there are 25 of them .
25 , yeah .
taunting me with their secrets .
yeah .
what , just a town car ? is your limo in the shop ?
how &apos;s agent siegel working out ?
oh , still checking my anklet
a couple times an hour .
that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s his job , like it or not .
i &apos;ve started going to coffee trucks
outside banks and museums .
you &apos;re toying with him .
how are things with you ?
owner &apos;s box at yankee stadium
for tomorrow &apos;s game .
elizabeth , myself ,
and my favorite pinstripes .
and a bunch of politicians .
i let elizabeth handle them .
she plays them like a violin .
it &apos;s almost as fun as watching the baseball game .
it &apos;s nice to see you enjoying the perks
of your new job .
thank you , but that &apos;s nothing .
i got something better .
what , are you throwing out the first pitch ?
better .
access to the secret government underground streets
with no traffic and plenty of parking .
you &apos;ve got to stop listening to mozzie .
he swears they exist .
better .
i can &apos;t imagine what you &apos;d think is better than that .
this is .
for tireless service to the bureau ,
for going above and beyond in the field ,
i do hereby promote special agent clinton jones
as acting s.s.a.
peter , thank you .
you deserve it .
i &apos;m just the lucky guy
who gets to give you your button .
i &apos;m proud of you .
thank you .
congratulations , supervisory special agent jones .
sounds important .
yeah , a little more autonomy .
a lot more work .
so you &apos;re happy .
oh , very .
although somehow , i think he &apos;s a bit happier
about it than i am .
listen , we are probably going to go celebrate .
you want to join us ?
next time .
no autonomy , still a lot of work .
all right . all right , next time .
congratulations .
thanks , man .
i &apos;ll help you on one condition .
you want to know what &apos;s inside the codex .
precisely the opposite .
i don &apos;t want to lay eyes on it .
as long as you &apos;re working with &quot; suit the sequel , &quot;
i have to become a new man .
what do you think ?
too ringo ?
too bieber .
look , if you want to redefine yourself ,
you should become a teetotaler .
there &apos;s some lies even i can &apos;t sell .
well , look , i appreciate your identity crisis ,
but i need to focus on how to steal the codex .
con suit 2.0 into removing your anklet .
siegel &apos;s never taken my anklet off before .
the first time he does , he &apos;s gonna be on high alert .
i can &apos;t risk it .
besides , it already shows me at the museum .
i need to find a reason to be there .
we can piggyback .
convince someone else to rob the museum .
two thieves go in , and one comes out in cuffs .
and if you &apos;re investigating a possible robbery ,
you have every reason to be there .
yeah , but who do we piggyback ?
i mean it &apos;s got to be someone good enough
to pull it off , but someone we don &apos;t mind screwing over .
zev .
who &apos;s that ?
zev is a besmirchment on the name of con men .
remember the de beers diamond vault heist ?
yeah , you spent months working on it ,
and then someone got there an hour ahead of you .
and pulled off the heist exactly as i planned it .
that was zev . that &apos;s what he does .
he &apos;s an idea @-@ napper .
the thief of thieves .
and now we can use it against him .
and i get to cross a name off my enemies list .
you know , for most people , that &apos;s a metaphor .
it &apos;s not an actual list .
good ?
so , what can we have zev steal ?
a karen kates painting .
i &apos;m telling you , barry ,
it &apos;s just sitting there waiting to be grabbed .
i &apos;ve got it all worked out .
it &apos;s the perfect plan .
i &apos;ll spell out all the details for zev .
while you do that , i &apos;ll convince siegel
that someone &apos;s gonna rob the museum .
i &apos;m hearing chatter .
i mean , i don &apos;t know who the thief is ,
but word is it &apos;s gonna happen soon .
stakeouts are time @-@ intensive , neal .
i mean , &quot; soon &quot; could mean
you and me sitting out there for weeks .
you sure ?
yeah , it &apos;s good intel .
look , you know what ? i don &apos;t want to push it , so--
no , no , no .
tell you what . i &apos;ll run it up the flagpole .
all right .
what ?
i just feel like i should be the one
to pitch it to peter .
why is that ?
i don &apos;t want you putting your neck on the line .
it &apos;s my intel .
i should be responsible for it in case it &apos;s bad .
i &apos;ll pitch it to peter .
okay .
all right , siegel is paranoid
that i &apos;m always pulling a con .
so we &apos;ll use that to launder the con through him .
by the time peter hears about it ,
it &apos;ll all sound like it was all siegel &apos;s idea .
you feel good about this intel ?
i do .
my source seemed pretty confident .
already with reliable sources .
haven &apos;t wasted any time since coming to the city .
the wicked don &apos;t rest . neither should we , right ?
no . i have to say i &apos;m jealous .
i love a good stakeout .
well , you &apos;re welcome to join us .
oh . i wouldn &apos;t mind if i do .
that &apos;d be great , but come on ,
you have the yankees game today .
i do . i do .
maybe tomorrow then .
sure .
stakeout approved .
good luck , you two .
won &apos;t be the same without you .
hey , peter .
i have more forms for you to sign .
and i &apos;m gonna have carpal tunnel by the end of the month .
i don &apos;t know how hughes handled all this paperwork .
he had a stamp with his signature on it .
with caffrey around , i &apos;ll risk the carpal .
is it strange ?
hmm ?
yeah , i mean , seeing caffrey running around on cases with siegel ,
and you &apos;re sitting up here ?
it is .
it is , but there are a lot of changes going on around here .
i mean , your promotion , diana &apos;s baby ,
siegel .
change is good .
yankees tickets good .
yes . yes , yankees tickets .
which reminds me , i have to get going .
i &apos;ve got to jump on our underground street
to beat traffic .
long story .
when &apos;s the last time you checked caffrey &apos;s anklet ?
peter ?
ten minutes ago .
he &apos;s home ,
probably painting something he shouldn &apos;t be .
ah , baked parchment .
just like mama used to make .
all right , the book is attached to an a90 pressure plate ,
so i won &apos;t be able to remove it .
fortunately , we only need chapter 13 .
how frustratingly intriguing of him .
well , at least we know where the chapter is .
13 gilded pages means 13 chapters .
let &apos;s hope mosconi didn &apos;t write a foreword .
if all hagen wants is the chapter ,
then it &apos;s not about the value of the book .
no . it &apos;s about the information on the pages .
moz , you can leave those pages blank .
nobody &apos;s going to see them .
uh , not soon . no .
but eventually , they will .
and when that day comes ,
my manifesto will finally get the attention it deserves .
uh @-@ huh . do you think zev took the bait ?
i followed him this morning .
he &apos;s already prepping for it .
the museum closes at 5 : 30 .
i said that i was turning off
the security cameras at 6 : 00 p.m.
and that i was breaking in 15 minutes later ,
just to be safe .
which means zev will break in at 6 : 00 .
in reality , i &apos;m doing all that at 5 : 50 .
that &apos;s when you go in .
all right , so i got ten minutes
until zev gets there ,
i &apos;ll steal it , get out ,
and then arrest him with siegel .
we know zev will find a way in .
what &apos;s yours ?
you never gave me your name .
didn &apos;t i ?
sorry .
rebecca .
neal .
i was hoping i &apos;d run into you .
yeah ?
yeah .
i was also hoping i &apos;d get here
before the museum closed , but--
one out of two isn &apos;t bad .
no . it &apos;s definitely not .
i always forget to take this thing off .
i swear i think i--
i think i even wore it to dinner last week .
i have something here i thought
you might be able to help me out with .
what is it ?
well , you tell me .
how old is this ?
i mean , it looks mid @-@ renaissance .
yeah .
but there &apos;s a rhythm to the language that &apos;s ...
if i didn &apos;t know better ,
i &apos;d say that &apos;s the president in a flying saucer .
okay , whoever did this is either brilliant
or insane .
oh , my gosh , i , um--
i have a thing that i am late for ...
yeah .
that now i really wish i didn &apos;t have ...
i understand .
but i am .
i better--
rebecca .
yeah ?
i need that back .
right . sorry .
bye .
bye .
get in .
let &apos;s set up our post across the street .
showing up early . i like that .
i wanted to get a quick look at the museum beforehand .
but you knew that from checking on my anklet .
didn &apos;t check .
yet .
i was too busy apartment shopping over in the village .
what &apos;d you think ?
you may be a con man ,
but you were right about that pizza .
what &apos;d i tell you ?
so i got you something .
aw , man . you didn &apos;t have to .
thank you . i didn &apos;t get you anything .
you catch me a bad guy , we &apos;ll call it even .
all right .
well , i have to say , the owner &apos;s box
has officially spoiled me .
that &apos;s the only way to watch a ball game from now on .
you and me both .
oh , really ?
i didn &apos;t think you were watching the game half the time .
well , all that glad @-@ handing can be a bit distracting .
wasn &apos;t what i was talking about .
i mean , yes , peter burke was there watching ,
but it seemed like your mind was somewhere else .
could it have been a stakeout ?
i used to live for a stakeout .
the radio , deviled ham from my wife ,
good conversation ,
and then arresting the bad guy .
and now you &apos;re stuck eating amazing food ,
watching your favorite sports team
with the most amazing seats in the house .
with my lovely wife .
i was wondering if you were gonna put that part in .
they said i could join them .
it &apos;s not that late .
i mean , you definitely could .
or you could rip off the band @-@ aid .
elevator buttons .
really ? wow .
well , someone &apos;s gotta make &apos; em .
my grandfather realized that ,
created a monopoly on the business .
probably because nobody else wanted to .
their loss , our millions .
why the fbi ? i mean , you come from money .
there are a lot of things you could &apos;ve done .
i grew up knowing bankers and stockbrokers ,
trust fund kids .
just got to a point where i realized
i was surrounded with criminals ,
only they wore suits and had great lawyers .
so you decided to do something about it .
well , you could argue that the elevator button kid
never really fit in .
this is all petty revenge .
ah , okay .
i get bored easily .
i like to keep things interesting .
yep .
it &apos;s a riot around here .
we are sitting outside a museum right now ,
and we &apos;re waiting for a guy to steal a painting .
come on , tell me you don &apos;t love that .
it was just a lot more exciting
when i was the guy doing the stealing .
yeah , that &apos;s why i like being your handler , neal .
you &apos;re either gonna make my career
or you &apos;re gonna ruin it .
there &apos;s no middle ground with you .
and you find that exciting ?
beats making buttons .
hey , 11 o &apos;clock .
what am i looking at , besides a bad hairstyle ?
that guy &apos;s gone around the perimeter
two times now .
could be just a guy taking a stroll ?
come on , how many guys you know
take a stroll with a bag that big
one that &apos;s big enough to carry all the tools
he &apos;d need to break in ?
all right . i &apos;ll call it in .
no , no , if i &apos;m wrong ,
we &apos;re gonna spook the real thief .
all right .
let &apos;s approach him .
wait , no . one of us should stay here .
in case it &apos;s a false alarm , we can keep an eye out .
yeah , that &apos;s a good idea , neal .
stay put .
eight minutes , caffrey .
what are you--
did i miss anything ?
neal , where are you ?
you &apos;re supposed to be in the museum by now .
nothing like a stakeout .
what are you--
you could &apos;ve saved me a slice .
yeah , well , i didn &apos;t know you were coming .
el went out with some of her friends .
thought i &apos;d check in . where &apos;s siegel ?
he just saw some movement , so he went to go check it out .
oh , well , i &apos;ll keep his seat warm
until he comes back .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
hughes used to join me
for a stakeout or two back in the day .
it &apos;s not about whether you can be here .
i &apos;d figure you &apos;d like one last stakeout
for old time &apos;s sake .
yeah , and then what , peter ?
one last undercover job ? one last case ?
it &apos;s always gonna be &quot; one last &quot; something with you ,
but the truth is this is not your life now .
neal--
you and i aren &apos;t partners anymore .
and you wanted to go . you should just go .
you &apos;re right .
are the cameras off , moz ?
yeah .
sir . hey .
what &apos;s your problem ?
i need to see inside the bag .
keep going .
there something wrong , officer ?
no , no , no . no , there &apos;s nothing wrong .
i &apos;m sorry . go ahead .
barry the decoy worked .
siegel &apos;s heading back to his car .
you got kind of a late start .
i ran into a peter @-@ shaped problem .
well , you &apos;re gonna run into a handcuff @-@ shaped problem
if you don &apos;t get back to the car soon .
keep siegel occupied a little longer .
there &apos;s only so many times
he &apos;s gonna chase a head of hair .
what &apos;s uh @-@ oh ?
zev &apos;s here .
siegel &apos;s heading in his direction .
all right , do not let siegel see him get into the museum
or none of this works .
well , what am i supposed to do ?
he &apos;ll recognize me from little star .
if he sees my face , then i &apos;m going to the clink .
then don &apos;t let him see it .
zev &apos;s inside .
fortunately or unfortunately , i &apos;ve got siegel .
lose him , moz .
i need a couple more minutes .
well , i &apos;m not sure you &apos;ll have it .
like i said , zev &apos;s good .
he &apos;ll make quick work with the security .
neal , your new suit can make me .
you have to do something .
i know , moz . hang on .
i didn &apos;t mean anything quite that drastic .
it wasn &apos;t me .
i thought you said he was good , moz .
i may have let my desire for revenge
overstate his skills .
come on , caffrey . pick up the phone , damn it .
i need backup .
did you see him ?
well , the alarm &apos;s going off . he must be inside .
all right , let &apos;s go .
what do we got ?
he escaped with the painting .
damn it .
all right , baker , report in .
cheers .
honey ! i didn &apos;t expect you .
how you doing , sarah , rachel ?
i ripped off the band @-@ aid .
how &apos;s it feel ?
it smarts .
but you &apos;re right . it &apos;s for the best .
you want a drink ?
i &apos;d love one .
the two of you sat outside the gershon
and let a thief steal a painting right under your noses .
there &apos;s no excuse , sir .
we &apos;re gonna find him , peter .
yeah ? how do you plan to do that ?
you have no evidence , no positive i.d.
you are lucky that i have something .
i spoke with museum security .
there &apos;s a chance that our thief didn &apos;t work alone .
there may be an accomplice .
security clocked an employee using her i.d. badge
right before the robbery .
i &apos;m hopeful that after i talk to her ,
we &apos;ll get to the bottom of this .
my first peter burke lecture .
i feel 2 inches shorter .
yeah , well , i used to be 7 &apos; 4 . &quot; you &apos;ll get used to it .
hopefully not too used to it .
you coming ?
yeah , of course .
you understand how this looks .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand anything at all .
i--
neal .
hello , rebecca .
you two know each other ?
i &apos;m sorry you had to come here .
did you know about this ?
it &apos;s news to me .
when i heard the museum might be a target ,
i did a little reconnaissance .
you flirted with me . we talked about--
a lot of things , i know ,
and i &apos;m sorry for the deception .
but i needed to see if it might be an inside job .
look , i had nothing to do with this .
i believe you .
but it doesn &apos;t look good .
look , i @-@ i swear i had my key card
when i left work .
i didn &apos;t even realize it was missing
until these guys with badges showed up at my apartment .
did you encounter anyone who might have stolen it ?
a new neighbor , or a stranger on the subway ?
uh ... i can &apos;t think of anyone .
agent siegel will continue questioning you .
neal , come with me .
we &apos;ll figure this out .
i &apos;m taking over this case .
what ?
i screwed up .
i showed up and distracted you ...
no .
when you should have been watching the gershon .
this is my fault .
peter--
and it &apos;s gonna be a mark on siegel &apos;s record .
i can guarantee you this is not your fault .
either way , i &apos;m gonna fix it .
you think she &apos;s involved ?
no , i don &apos;t .
i checked her out when i went to go visit the museum .
she has no real motivation to do it .
just the bad luck of catching the thief &apos;s eye .
well , yeah , looks like it .
then we need to find out who &apos;s really behind this .
they have to catch zev .
this is the second time he &apos;s stolen something from me .
well , technically , we were trying to trap him .
and he got away . that only makes it worse .
an innocent woman is being questioned
by the fbi because of me , moz .
yeah , there &apos;s that too .
on the upside , you did steal the right chapter .
and surprisingly , sometimes , the reality
surpasses imagination .
any idea what it means ?
no clue yet .
but i made us a copy , so we &apos;ll be able to figure out
why hagen wants it so badly .
none of this matters if they don &apos;t catch zev .
the longer he &apos;s out there ,
the closer they &apos;re gonna look at the museum .
they might realize there &apos;s more than just a painting missing .
so solve the case .
i did solve the case . i created the case .
exactly . pretend that you didn &apos;t .
do what you and peter always do .
solve it .
&quot; one last case , &quot; huh ?
look , about that , i said things i shouldn &apos;t have .
no , no , you should have . i @-@ i &apos;m glad you did .
i &apos;m here because i owe it to agent siegel .
where is he ?
i figured it &apos;d be best if it was just the two of us .
one last case .
okay .
what &apos;s going on here ?
the owner of the collection
asked for it to be returned
following the break @-@ in .
just going through it before it gets shipped off .
what , you think our thief
stole something from the collection ?
no , but you can never be too safe .
you can &apos;t open that ! you can &apos;t open that .
the owner has left strict instructions
that this cannot be opened .
hey , sorry .
you really think he left something behind .
well , an alarm went off .
that can cause the best of us to slip up .
all right .
let &apos;s say you were the thief .
you got a ski mask for me too ?
what would you have done if you were here ?
all right , i &apos;ve just stolen this piece of art ,
and suddenly an alarm goes off .
you &apos;re sweating .
even though i &apos;m a professional ,
yeah , i &apos;m scared .
security response time isn &apos;t that great here ,
but still , caged in .
the main security door ...
fall roughly here .
peter , don &apos;t scuff up the floor with your shoe .
oh , they &apos;ve got machines to clean that .
you &apos;re caught . what now ?
i &apos;d examine the security door for a weakness .
it &apos;s a mark x2 security door .
well , if i &apos;ve done my research , i would know that .
and i &apos;d have tools with me for the art .
i &apos;d use them to pry the panel open .
and then i need to get to the wire to short the circuit .
what are you doing ?
i took my gloves off .
which means they &apos;re might be prints .
unless you were smart enough to wipe it .
no , there &apos;s adrenaline rushing through my body .
guards heading my way .
sloppy work .
well , nobody &apos;s perfect .
let &apos;s hope not .
get me an e.r.t. in here ,
and someone from the museum to lower the security doors .
doors ?
all the security doors ?
come on .
even i don &apos;t go shopping when the alarm goes off .
just the ones at the karen kates display .
let &apos;s catch a thief .
let &apos;s do it .
come on , get &apos; em up , boys .
fbi .
zev demetrius , you &apos;re under arrest .
for what ?
you held to your word , caffrey .
what was that ?
i got you pizza .
you got me a bad guy .
can we keep that arrangement going ?
well , you make it a dinner at masa ,
and we might have a deal .
you and me , we &apos;re two sides of the same coin , caffrey .
you and me ?
yeah .
how so ?
we &apos;re both self @-@ made men .
just in different ways .
you came from millions .
i did . and then i was disowned .
see , arresting your family &apos;s friends will do that .
i guess that explains the phantom ring .
well , not exactly .
she missed the life . i don &apos;t blame her .
she thought she was marrying a siegel .
she got agent siegel instead .
you gave up all that
for long hours and little reward ?
yeah , i did .
you gave up the exotic locales
and exciting capers for the same thing , neal .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
oh , come on , caffrey .
we both know you can ditch that anklet any time ,
if you really wanted to .
i gotta ask you something , caffrey .
what ?
good work , you two .
peter , i read your report .
your name wasn &apos;t anywhere in there , and it should &apos;ve been .
it was your case .
i stepped into it , and it was only fair that i stepped out .
either way , i appreciate it .
i look forward to what you two bring me next .
what were you gonna ask me ?
you want to get a drink ? celebrate ?
ah , i can &apos;t tonight . next time .
right , next time .
good work today .
i made a mistake .
we all make mistakes .
including zev , fortunately .
you should have seen the look on his face .
yeah , it probably matched the one on mine .
i took off my gloves , moz .
when the navajos make a piece of art ,
they always add a flaw .
only the great spirit is perfect .
humanity should not try to be .
that &apos;s a little grandiose , don &apos;t you think ?
all i &apos;m saying is that we are mere mortals .
we all make mistakes now and then .
lately , i &apos;ve been making a lot of them .
and i &apos;m starting to think
that delivering this chapter is another one .
hagen is a forger .
if we gave him a fake , he &apos;d know it .
we need a game plan , moz .
in order for hagen &apos;s plan to work ,
he had to give us access to the chapter first .
that was his mistake . we &apos;ll use it to our advantage .
we figure out what &apos;s hidden in those pages
and get to it first .
you and me decoding a puzzle .
never bet against the house .
oh , by the way ,
i think your mistake was that wig , macgyver .
seriously , you &apos;re just jealous .
because for once , people are staring at all of this
instead of staring at all of that .
okay , they &apos;re staring , all right .
do you think if i find a paper clip ,
some silly putty , and a rubber band ,
you could make me an 8 @-@ track player ?
i could make a wine opener .
that , i believe .
knockoff suit has already seen my face .
hagen doesn &apos;t need to .
thanks , moz .
you caused quite a ruckus .
you got what you wanted . that &apos;s all that matters .
this is the real thing ?
you know your forgeries . you tell me .
i will .
see , this relationship is working wonderfully .
when does it end , hagen ?
i &apos;m a fair man .
i won &apos;t hold this over your head forever .
when i get what i want , i &apos;ll leave you be .
but you won &apos;t tell me what that is .
come on , mr. caffrey .
i know you love a mystery .
don &apos;t spoil it for yourself .
shouldn &apos;t somebody else be doing this ?
i mean , you &apos;re the acting s.s.a. now .
and returning a multimillion @-@ dollar piece of art
is exactly what an acting s.s.a. does .
and it feels damn good doing it .
what i don &apos;t get is why you &apos;re here .
well , i mean , it &apos;s rare for someone like me
to be able to return something .
i just thought i &apos;d try it on for size .
you could &apos;ve told me it was about a girl .
why can &apos;t it be both ?
hey .
hey . neal , is it ?
i never lied about my name .
about anything , actually .
you sure did leave out a lot .
i did . i heard you were cleared .
i was . just in time to be fired .
why ? the painting was returned .
you had nothing to do with the theft in the first place .
from your lips to my boss &apos;s ears .
but i &apos;m the reason the thief got in , so ...
because they stole your key card .
so i &apos;m gone .
it doesn &apos;t matter anyway .
my hope was
that the owner would let us look at and study the codex ,
and now it &apos;s gone .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not your fault .
see you .
see you .
initial report is a mugging gone wrong .
no known acquaintances in the area .
we &apos;re not sure why he was here .
think he was looking for an apartment ?
he was , but not here .
