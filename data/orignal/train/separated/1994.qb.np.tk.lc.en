because we &apos;re suing you and your entire firm for fraud .
i &apos;m looking at a document that implicates you in a cover @-@ up .
i savaged his reputation all because you looked me in the eye
and told me that your hood was rock solid .
you make it right on your own or i will .
when were you planning on telling me this ?
did you find what you &apos;re not looking for ?
no , did you find what you &apos;re not looking for ?
nope .
that document never came into this office .
where the hell &apos;s donna ?
she &apos;s in the file room .
hasn &apos;t found that document yet .
any one of them could have seen it and missed it .
i need to know that didn &apos;t happen ,
唐娜 · 保尔森
or i need to know who to fire .
never thought i &apos;d see
the great harvey specter break a sweat .
you want to race , jeffrey ?
i &apos;m more than happy to kick your ass .
believe me , harvey ,
i didn &apos;t get up at 5 : 00 a.m. for my health .
a guy like you in central park at this hour ?
that &apos;s not where my mind went either .
only guy i &apos;m here to solicit is you , buddy .
i &apos;ll assume you &apos;ve heard of marco mendoza .
yeah , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old tennis phenom .
what about him ?
i &apos;m on the cusp of signing that kid .
i want you to be part of the team .
just because i know about tennis
doesn &apos;t mean i give a shit about tennis .
hey , the basketballs in your office
didn &apos;t autograph themselves , harvey .
you owe me .
oh , please .
i &apos;ve brought you just as many clients as you brought me .
five minutes with the kid . that &apos;s all i &apos;m asking .
you &apos;re an agent , jeffrey . it &apos;s never all you &apos;re asking .
there might be one slight wrinkle .
so you want me to emancipate him from his father ?
that &apos;s a hell of a thing to do just for a commission .
just listen to what he has to say .
marco , tell him your story .
look , i &apos;ve been playing tennis since before i could walk .
when i was six , i was crushing kids in high school .
i don &apos;t play cards , i don &apos;t drink .
what i do is win .
i like this kid .
so what does that have to do with your father ?
he won &apos;t let me go pro .
so it &apos;s all about the money .
no , i don &apos;t care about the money .
you can keep the money .
nine out of ten tournaments are closed to amateurs .
if i don &apos;t go pro , i can &apos;t play against the best .
and if i can &apos;t play against the best ,
i can &apos;t be the best .
that &apos;s a great speech , but you &apos;re 16,
and what i &apos;m not hearing is why you can &apos;t wait two more years .
people hit their prime at different ages , mr. specter .
look at me .
i have a chance to be great , and i have a chance now .
you know that paper doesn &apos;t
put itself in the machine , right ?
what the hell is wrong with you ?
me ? you &apos;re the one that looks
like you &apos;re burying a dead body .
it is 6 : 00 in the morning .
i come in here to shred in peace ,
and you walk in and you scare the crap out of me .
i &apos;m sorry ... &quot; shred in peace &quot; ?
do you have any idea how dangerous this machine is ?
okay , i &apos;m sorry .
if you want , i can help .
i &apos;m actually here to do some shredding myself .
you know what ? never mind .
you &apos;ve ruined the whole thing .
well , the good news is ,
we don &apos;t have a copy of that memo .
i &apos;m sorry to rain on your parade ,
but the accusation here isn &apos;t that you have it ,
it &apos;s that you buried it ,
so we should probably move forward .
to what ?
we need to put them on the defensive .
no , we don &apos;t .
harvey .
we need to get them to drop the case .
and how would we do that ?
how would i do it ?
i would go to the randall family .
they got screwed and they want justice ,
but i &apos;m not the guy who screwed them ,
so we need to convince them that i--
are you crazy ?
you trashed this woman &apos;s dead husband in open court .
do you think she gives a shit
about whether or not you buried that document ?
if you go there , you &apos;re not just poking the bear ,
you &apos;re putting a cattle prod up its ass .
is that the same crack advice
you gave brockton cosmetics and drake consulting
and nappi llc . ?
&apos;cause none of those companies exist anymore .
congratulations , harvey .
you found the three cases that i &apos;ve lost in 14 years .
and do you know what else those cases have in common ?
nothing . because i learn from my mistakes .
well , i &apos;d prefer to be represented by someone
who doesn &apos;t make any mistakes in the first place .
like you ?
because you &apos;ve been accused of burying evidence
not once , but twice .
those accusations are bullshit .
and that is what i &apos;m here to prove .
jessica , if i may ?
i don &apos;t think harvey &apos;s problem is with allison .
i think his problem is with me .
daniel , we don &apos;t need to air our laundry in here .
this is a privileged conversation .
jessica , i &apos;m asking you and harvey to trust me .
so i &apos;m going to do the same for you .
i brought allison in here because i think she &apos;s the best .
use her or don &apos;t .
but , if not , i suggest you find someone just as good .
harvey ...
will you give allison and me a minute ?
let her down easy .
allison , i am impressed by you .
but if i &apos;m going to give you this job ,
i need to know that i can trust you .
i &apos;m a straight shooter , jessica .
easy to say , harder to prove .
all right , how about this ?
um , you are an elegant woman ,
but there &apos;s no getting around it ...
that dress does not belong in this office .
i like you .
this may be something that you don &apos;t like .
you won &apos;t be the one dictating terms here . i will .
and regarding your laundry ,
you have my word that danny won &apos;t be involved ,
but you need to keep that man on a leash .
she said that to your face ?
yep .
you kick her ass out ?
hired her on the spot .
the woman insults you ,
all of a sudden you &apos;re in bed with her ?
maybe i should tell you how much i hate those shoes .
that &apos;s the joke you &apos;re gonna make ?
what ? it &apos;s both respectful
and disrespectful at the same time .
harvey , i don &apos;t want you to overlook
the point of the story . it &apos;s allison &apos;s case .
the firm is the client , and you &apos;re--
the dog on a leash ?
stay out of her way .
i got the address .
then i guess it &apos;s time
for this dog to go chase some cars .
i am not seeing what i &apos;m seeing .
mrs. randall , please ,
i know you hate me for what i did to your husband .
&quot; hate &quot; is not the word .
there is no word to describe what i feel for you .
now get your ass ...
jennifer , look where we are .
i don &apos;t mean to disrespect you
or dishonor your husband &apos;s memory .
you &apos;ve already done that .
i &apos;m trying to make up for it now .
now that your back &apos;s against the wall .
no , i started years ago .
this says he &apos;s our anonymous donor .
it &apos;s true .
of course . guilty conscience .
no , i don &apos;t have a guilty conscience ,
&apos;cause i wasn &apos;t the one who hid that memo .
look , i went after your husband
because i thought that car was solid .
i didn &apos;t like doing it , but it was my job .
why &apos;d you give us the money then ?
because you were trying to make something good
come from something bad , like i am now .
what do you want ?
i know what he wants .
we &apos;re not dropping our suit .
and the fact that you would come here to tell me that
shows me just what kind of self @-@ serving trash you are .
you &apos;re right , i came here to get you to drop your suit .
but instead of self @-@ serving , let &apos;s talk about me serving you .
you want payback for what was done to you--
justice-- and i can get it .
my husband died ,
and you made me sit there while you shit on him .
that &apos;s what was done to me .
now you &apos;re gonna tell me that wasn &apos;t you ?
yeah , i want justice ,
but that little donation doesn &apos;t cover it .
this isn &apos;t really helping your street cred , harold .
it &apos;s not mine , it &apos;s louis &apos; .
what &apos;s his name ?
bruno . he brought him in
because he hasn &apos;t been eating .
whoa , wh--have you mentioned to louis
that you &apos;re allergic ?
i tried to , but he said that--
allergies are a sign of weakness .
right , and bringing your cat to work is a sign of strength .
yeah , you want to trade places ?
uh , nope .
no , i got a meeting in the conference room .
that &apos;s right , that little tennis fling .
makes me sick .
harvey &apos;s got no appreciation for the game .
man wouldn &apos;t know topspin if it hit him in the ball sack .
but enjoy yourself . get out .
can you not smell that ?
i &apos;m stuffed up .
how long has it been ?
two hours .
how often do i tell you to do it ?
i &apos;ll get the bag .
what &apos;s wrong , bruno ?
you &apos;re my best friend .
you all set ?
i &apos;m ready to roll .
good , &apos; cause i got a bidding war starting
for marco &apos;s endorsement .
dad ?
marco , why don &apos;t you take a seat ?
what &apos;s he doing here ?
he &apos;s here to meet with his son .
we &apos;re emancipating , and you said you were in .
i did , which means marco &apos;s my client ,
not you , so why don &apos;t you go home , jeffrey ?
i &apos;ll call you when we &apos;re done .
mr. mendoza , i want to be clear ,
i &apos;m not here to exploit your son .
i &apos;m here to protect him .
you &apos;re off to a good start .
you can ask any one of my clients .
they &apos;ll tell you the same .
you represent mchael jordan .
i do . in fact , i want to tell you a story about him .
you want to tell me a story about michael jordan
to convince me my son should turn pro ?
let me tell you a story about george washington .
maybe junior here could become president .
i &apos;m really more of an abe lincoln fan myself .
you know , freed the slaves , great beard .
you finished ?
yep .
everybody knows m.j. took two years off in his prime .
he regrets it to this day .
but he made that decision himself ,
and that &apos;s how he lives with it .
all your son is asking is for the chance to do the same .
i may not know mr. jordan ,
but i do know that he &apos;s divorced ,
and i &apos;ve heard the rumors about his gambling problem .
he &apos;s a man apart .
now , my son is not ready to handle that kind of life .
you &apos;ve prepared me for this since i was three .
i taught you tennis because it &apos;s a beautiful game .
you may not have set out to raise a prodigy ,
but the fact is , you did .
do you have any children , mr. specter ?
no ? then i &apos;m not interested in your parenting advice .
i &apos;m not giving parenting advice .
i &apos;m giving career advice .
you told me that you didn &apos;t want to exploit him ,
that you wanted to protect him--
him , not his career .
look , you don &apos;t get it .
they &apos;re the same to me .
all right , i &apos;m committed to both of them ,
and i don &apos;t give a shit if you like it or not .
marco .
you say that word to me
in front of these parasites ?
yeah , i &apos;ll say whatever i want to say .
shut your mouth .
now , you are not going to turn pro ,
and you are not going to continue down this path ,
and this conversation is over .
you just want to let him leave ?
look , i don &apos;t care what he does , okay ?
i want to file for emancipation .
so you &apos;re telling me you don &apos;t have it ?
i don &apos;t , but i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll turn up .
you sure ?
your job was to keep track of that one thing .
nice work .
it &apos;s a birthday card for norma .
she won &apos;t even tell us how old she is .
her birthday is today .
when do you think it &apos;s going to turn up ?
you know what , forget it .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
what &apos;s the matter with me is that nobody ever has
what they &apos;re supposed to in this goddamn office .
you know what ? i got bigger fish to fry .
put the wheels in motion .
&quot; the wheels &quot; ?
this isn &apos;t a merger , harvey .
you &apos;re talking about emancipation .
i &apos;m talking about filing for emancipation .
it &apos;s a tactic . he cares about his son .
nine times out of ten , he backs down .
and what if he doesn &apos;t ?
then we &apos;ll be doing exactly what the client wants us to do .
oh , you mean break up his family .
i mean help his family .
wonder what kind of relationship
you had with your father .
look , my father &apos;s not up for discussion .
the only bone of contention between them is this decision .
the sooner they resolve it , the sooner they can move on .
the sooner you get paid .
i cut billion dollar deals for breakfast .
i don &apos;t need this . i told you ,
it &apos;s what the client wants .
it &apos;s what he thinks he wants .
harvey , i was 11 when my dad died ,
and our last conversation was a fight .
if you gave me the choice to be a pro anything
or to make up with him , what do you think i &apos;d choose ?
if we don &apos;t do it , he &apos;ll find someone else who will .
if you don &apos;t want him to do it , change his goddamn mind .
now go .
fine .
here &apos;s your goddamn birthday card .
i don &apos;t appreciate you coming into my office saying
that no one at the firm has what they &apos;re supposed to have ,
and i don &apos;t know what crawled up your ass today ,
but i take care of my business .
i &apos;m sorry , rach . you &apos;re right .
this isn &apos;t about you . this is about me .
okay then .
i unplugged it .
and this time , i &apos;m not stopping you by accident .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about--
don &apos;t bullshit me , donna .
that &apos;s the same file you had in your hand this morning .
you ran out of here like you saw a ghost ,
you bit off rachel &apos;s head , talking about how people
never have the things they &apos;re supposed to have ,
and now you &apos;re right back here again .
it &apos;s not dalton enterprises you &apos;re holding .
that &apos;s the memo that harvey &apos;s been accused of burying .
you know , the fact that you would even accuse me of that
makes me sick .
but if you still don &apos;t believe me , fine .
see for yourself .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
tell me what happened .
i found it in the file room that day .
it has my date stamp on it ... mine .
we have to tell harvey .
he &apos;ll know what to do .
no , he won &apos;t .
donna , harvey &apos;s been operating under the assumption
that we never had this memo , all right ?
at some point , that assumption
is gonna bite him in the ass ,
and the later it happens , the bigger the bite .
nobody is going to believe
that a file that important just got lost .
they &apos;ll think that i got rid of it ,
and that harvey told me to do it .
this memo is part of a legal proceeding .
shredding it is a crime .
like practicing law without a license is a crime ?
unlike you , i didn &apos;t do this on purpose ,
and i am protecting harvey the best way that i know how .
allison holt is gonna figure out what happened .
and when she does , her priority &apos;s not going to be
protecting you or harvey .
it &apos;s gonna be protecting the firm .
you might be comfortable putting harvey in that position ,
but i &apos;m not .
so either you tell him , or i will .
the answer is yes .
what ?
you can have halloween off this year .
every july , you sit there staring at me
before coming in here with that sheepish look on your face
to ask to ...
i have to tell you something .
what ? what is it ?
what the hell were you thinking ?
you contacted the plaintiffs
without their lawyer present or our lawyer present .
exactly , i &apos;m not our lawyer .
i had every legal right to .
you weren &apos;t supposed to interfere .
neither were you . how did you even know ?
she &apos;s not supposed to tell you anything .
she was forced to tell me
when i got served with this goddamn subpoena .
you didn &apos;t want to put them on the defensive ,
which is good , because what you &apos;ve just done
is put us on the defensive ,
so now i have to spend the next two weeks
prepping everyone from jessica to your secretary ,
because travis tanner is gonna depose them under oath .
nobody here knows a goddamn thing about that memo .
let them waste their time with it .
this is why you hire outside counsel .
you can &apos;t see how reckless that was ,
even now , after it &apos;s blown up in your face .
fine , if you insist on pre @-@ deposing their depositions ,
let &apos;s get it over with . you can start with me .
i already have your version of events .
okay , you can start with donna .
what &apos;s not to understand ?
most fathers in the same situation would either
want to live vicariously through their children &apos;s lives
or sponge off their backs ,
but your father , he &apos;s just trying to protect you .
yeah , look , i know what he thinks he &apos;s doing .
marco , it &apos;s a year and eight months .
maybe , but you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like
to be better at something than everyone .
a year and eight months is 505 days .
12,120 hours and 727,200 minutes .
yeah , i know what it &apos;s like .
you can do math when you &apos;re an old man .
i can only dominate till i &apos;m 30 .
maybe , but if you go through with this now ,
you &apos;re gonna drive a wedge between the two of you
that &apos;ll last the rest of your life .
it &apos;s already there because of him .
i &apos;m like the horse in the stall .
he won &apos;t open the gate , and if it stays shut much longer ,
i &apos;m gonna go crazy .
all right , you &apos;re the client .
i just have a couple of questions for you
before we can file with the courts , okay ?
okay , great .
has your father ever abused drugs or alcohol ?
no .
is he a gambling addict ?
no , nothing like that .
is your home without
electricity , running water , food ?
we don &apos;t live in a slum .
emancipation requires proof
that your father is an unfit parent .
we have to think about how this plays in court .
and telling a judge that he just wants you
to wait until you finish high school before you make
millions of dollars is not going to cut it .
look , marco ...
what i saw in that conference room
is not a father who was unfit .
i saw a father who loves his son .
you saw something else in there , too .
you saw how furious he gets when he &apos;s defied .
what are you getting at ?
i &apos;m getting at what happens when he feels that way
and nobody else is around .
there &apos;s no reason to be concerned .
these are pro forma questions i &apos;m asking everyone .
oh , i &apos;m not concerned , i &apos;m bored ,
so can we just ...
of course .
do you think you can move that other there ?
it &apos;s my good side .
well , my better side . they &apos;re both good .
i &apos;m just going to start . um ...
so , when documents are received into the firm ,
they then come to you .
is that correct ?
yes .
and how do they get from the mail room to you ?
transporter beam .
ms. paulsen , i understand that your time is valuable ,
but i &apos;m here to prepare you .
and to a jury , sarcasm plays as obstructive .
obviously , any further mention of star trek
may just compound the problem , okay ?
aye , cap &apos;n .
it &apos;s donna , right ?
all right , so where you from , donna ?
upstate .
like utica ?
no , cortland , actually .
cortland &apos;s kind of in the middle , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m sorry , what does this have to do with ...
i &apos;m just trying to get to know you ,
break down the walls .
you may not know this about me ,
but the truth is , i &apos;m actually single .
divorced ?
as a matter of fact , yes .
but anyway , i &apos;ve been going on all these dates ,
and i found that sometimes the best way
to get the conversation going
is just start asking a bunch of questions .
for example , where do you see yourself in five years ?
well , actually , that &apos;s--
&apos;cause where i see you is in jail .
do you think i was born yesterday ?
you know what harvey did with that memo ,
and you &apos;re going to tell me right now .
harvey didn &apos;t do anything .
oh , i see .
he didn &apos;t have to because you did it for him .
that &apos;s not true .
then tell me what is true .
well , that &apos;s easy .
you don &apos;t give a shit about me or harvey .
this is a witch hunt ,
and i &apos;m not gonna sit in this room for another minute .
i &apos;ve worked with harvey since
he was a rookie in the mail room .
no way he buried that memo .
you didn &apos;t see donna in that room .
i &apos;m not saying she wouldn &apos;t do it if he asked .
i &apos;m saying he wouldn &apos;t ask .
wouldn &apos;t he ?
because she &apos;s not the only person i talked to .
now , a lot of people , they don &apos;t like harvey .
but even the ones that love him
say he likes to work in the grey .
i &apos;d like harvey to sign this affidavit ,
swearing that his office never received the memo .
why ?
to put with this motion to dismiss .
if you wanted to file a motion to dismiss ,
you would have done that already .
you want him to sign that thing to cover your ass .
do i think it &apos;s likely
that this case is gonna get dismissed ?
no , but it &apos;s worth a shot , and to your point ,
i &apos;m not just doing this to cover my ass .
i &apos;m doing it to cover your ass .
file the motion .
harvey will sign whatever i put in front of him .
i give you one simple task .
bruno isn &apos;t eating , so you give him milk .
i did .
this is half @-@ and @-@ half .
i thought he &apos;d like it . it &apos;s creamier .
hey , you know what , maybe next time
i &apos;ll just hand my cat over to michael vick .
is that a cat carrier in your hand ?
no .
is there a cat in that thing ?
it &apos;s called a feline transportation unit .
cat carrier .
okay , they wouldn &apos;t call it a cat carrier
when it costs $ 400 .
do they call it a rip @-@ off ?
okay , you know what ,
i don &apos;t have time for this .
besides , i &apos;m late as it is .
i have to ask . what appointment ?
dentist .
with a cat ?
for the cat .
you take him to a cat dentist ?
i can &apos;t take him to my dentist .
dr. schneller wouldn &apos;t know what to do with him .
dr. richard schneller ?
good @-@ bye , harvey .
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
if it &apos;s bad news , i don &apos;t want to hear it .
you seem upset .
of course i &apos;m upset .
i just found out that louis and i
share the same dentist .
have you spoken to donna yet ?
no , and i &apos;m pissed about it .
i need her to get me a new dentist .
well , we have a problem ,
whether you want to hear it or not .
what ?
marco needs to be emancipated from his father .
but that &apos;s not a problem . that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
no , i don &apos;t mean to let him play .
i mean to keep him safe .
that is directly from the hospital .
his dad did that to him .
we need to get him away from his father .
i need to get him away .
i set the hearing , and i &apos;m going to win .
i &apos;m hearing a lot of &quot; i &quot; s in there .
harvey--
this isn &apos;t housing court .
this is a kid &apos;s life .
i know that , and the only reason
you know that is because i gave a shit
about this kid &apos;s life in the first place .
you think i didn &apos;t think i was smarter
than the guy i started working for ?
i did , and i was , and i waited my goddamn turn .
harvey , i &apos;m ready .
it &apos;s time to let me out of the gate .
allison &apos;s filing a motion to dismiss .
she &apos;s swinging for the fences , i &apos;ll give her that .
you know what , i &apos;m gonna swing for the fences too .
mike &apos;s going to court .
i am ?
what &apos;s the case ?
emancipation .
from him ?
i wish .
he doesn &apos;t need a court order for that .
our little baby &apos;s growing up .
okay .
listen , i need you to sign this affidavit
that we never received that memo from coastal motors .
oh , my god ! oh , i &apos;m--
there are napkins over there .
i knew he wasn &apos;t a lawyer .
i didn &apos;t think he was an idiot .
i knew he was an idiot .
i didn &apos;t know he was spastic .
i &apos;m sorry , guys .
when you get this cleaned up , come see me .
i &apos;ll get you a fresh one .
what the hell was that ?
what ?
you know what .
it was an accident .
it was intentional .
you ambushed me with a cup of coffee .
think i haven &apos;t seen ronin ?
it was all i could think of .
meaning ?
donna was supposed to tell you .
tell me what ?
you can &apos;t sign the affidavit .
you &apos;ll be committing perjury .
what the hell were you thinking ?
i didn &apos;t know how to tell you .
&quot; harvey , i found the memo . &quot;
is that so goddamn hard ?
you don &apos;t understand . it had my name on it .
i stamped it in . that implicates you .
did you keep it from me four years ago ?
i don &apos;t even remember seeing it four years ago .
then i don &apos;t give a shit what it implicates .
you don &apos;t keep it from me now ?
i had never made a mistake like that ,
and i thought that i needed to--
look , keeping it from me isn &apos;t a mistake .
it &apos;s a decision .
i wanted to protect you .
lying to me doesn &apos;t protect me .
you betrays me .
betrays you ?
if i had told you the truth--
you don &apos;t keep things from me !
you keep things from me all the time !
that &apos;s because i &apos;m your boss .
well , maybe you shouldn &apos;t be my boss anymore .
i did what i thought i had to do for you ,
and if you can &apos;t ...
just fire me .
let me explain something to you .
that memo doesn &apos;t hurt me .
it helps me .
if i had buried it , we wouldn &apos;t have it .
but you found it , so that &apos;s a good thing .
what ?
wh @-@ what &apos;d you do ?
oh , what did you do ?
allison had that freaking camera ,
and i was--
she implied that we were--
what did you do ?
it &apos;s gone .
you destroyed it ?
i &apos;m not going to fire you , donna .
i might kill you , but i &apos;m not gonna fire you .
what are you going to do ?
what you should &apos;ve done from day one .
let me get this straight .
your own assistant destroys evidence ,
and you still want to go to trial ?
yes .
no .
you need to cut a deal right now .
you mean we need to cut a deal , right ?
because we &apos;re all on the same side ?
harvey .
you think i didn &apos;t know
what you were up to with that affidavit ?
i was advising my client , the firm .
you once told me i was the firm .
she came to me and thought that you were in on it .
i said no way .
she wanted you to sign that thing .
i &apos;m the leader of this firm . i made a decision .
you were happy to do it . don &apos;t blame me for donna .
i &apos;m not , but i need to know if you still believe me .
i do .
that &apos;s beside the point .
we have a decision to make .
there is no decision .
we need to cut a deal--today .
you know what ,
that &apos;s the difference between us , allison .
you want to lose small . i want to win big .
she &apos;s the one who has to try the case .
regardless of what donna did ,
i never saw the memo .
are you gonna sell a jury on that ?
maybe the same way you sold it to the randall family .
we have a window to settle this before we have to disclose .
but it &apos;s closing , and when it does ,
we could offer them the moon ,
they &apos;re not gonna take it .
what &apos;s the downside of asking ?
we went through this with the nurses .
it tells them we &apos;re weak .
we are weak .
set it up .
and whatever you &apos;re thinking , i don &apos;t want to hear it .
mr. mendoza , you &apos;ve asserted that , as a parent ,
you have certain rights .
do those include the right to discipline marco
as you see fit ?
every parent has that right .
the right to teach your child a lesson .
yes .
when he defies you .
if need be .
and if need be , do you get angry ?
do you fly off the handle ? do you become abusive ?
no , i would never go that far .
mr. mendoza , would you agree that ,
along with those rights ,
you have certain responsibilities as a parent ?
of course .
the responsibility to keep your son healthy ?
marco gets up every day at 4 : 30 to train .
i think that one &apos;s covered .
the responsibility to keep your son safe ?
that &apos;s the first job of every parent .
let &apos;s talk about may 18th of last year .
you took your son to the hospital
where he was treated for severe dehydration .
rushed my son to keep him safe .
what i &apos;m interested in
is how he got dehydrated in the first place .
he was running laps .
hadn &apos;t you had an argument
about going pro the night before ?
yes .
and you wanted to teach him a lesson , as was your right .
what ?
he questioned your authority , didn &apos;t he ?
he &apos;s done it before , hasn &apos;t he ?
and you don &apos;t like that , do you ?
you are twisting this .
you got angry ,
you flew off the handle , and you became abusive .
objection , badgering .
easy , mr. ross .
marco has never called 911 .
he &apos;s never reported me to social services .
he &apos;s never complained to anyone .
they never do .
you think i put my own son in the hospital ?
oh , i &apos;ve read this report . i know you did .
and i know you will again .
you are a lying little piece of sh-- .
there it is .
mr. mendoza , that &apos;s enough .
no further questions .
oh , what the hell ? you don &apos;t sneak up like that .
i wasn &apos;t sneaking up . i was just getting coffee .
yeah , well , the paralegal needs coffee .
i guess the junior partner needs to get out of her way .
you know what , louis , if you treated people here
just a tenth as nicely as you treat your cat ,
they might not feel about you the way that you know they do .
i &apos;m sorry .
is everything okay ?
no , i just have , like , a condition with my tear ducts .
oh , my god .
i just assumed that he wasn &apos;t eating
because of his toothache ...
but it turns out his hygiene was perfect .
but of course it was , because we flossed every day , so ...
and then they did these tests .
and i told the vet , &quot; money is no object , &quot;
but , uh ...
it was too late .
bruno was suffering ...
excuse me .
no--
hey .
hey .
is everything okay ?
not exactly .
okay , i &apos;ll come back when you &apos;re finished .
i wasn &apos;t talking about you .
not everything &apos;s about you , you know .
now , you see , that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
what &apos;s going on with donna ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do you mean ?
i saw you watching us the other day .
you know something .
come on , mike , how many secrets are you gonna keep from me ?
it &apos;s not mine . it &apos;s donna &apos;s .
i &apos;m not saying you need to give me specifics .
i just need to know that she &apos;s okay .
she screwed up , and it &apos;s not small .
what &apos;s gonna happen ?
harvey &apos;s going to fix it .
how do you know ?
you &apos;re gonna fix this situation with donna , right ?
why should i tell you ?
what ?
if i hadn &apos;t caught you , when were you gonna tell me
that she had that memo ?
i wasn &apos;t , &apos; cause she promised me she would .
well , what would have happened if you hadn &apos;t been
in my office when jessica brought me that affidavit ?
that would &apos;ve been between you and donna .
and i would have committed perjury .
you &apos;re right . i should have told you ,
or had donna tell you then and there , but i was thinking
the fact that she actually found this thing helps us .
yeah , it would &apos;ve helped us .
she destroyed it .
whoa .
yeah .
whoa .
harvey , she was backed into a corner .
she made a bad call .
look , we can still--
tell the truth ?
how do you think that &apos;s going to play in court ?
oh , my god . um , i have to go .
you screwed up with marco , didn &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m on it .
and this thing with donna , just let it go .
i &apos;m sure she said she was sorry .
she is sorry .
but she never said it .
didn &apos;t expect to see you today .
i wanted to get you the offer as soon as i could .
you could have called .
no , i couldn &apos;t .
tanner &apos;s terms .
the firm pays $ 5 million in damages ,
as well as all legal fees .
what else ?
pearson hardman immediately and irrevocably
strips harvey specter of his senior partnership
and reports him to the new york bar association .
i know this isn &apos;t what you want to hear ,
but i would take this deal and run .
what do you want now ?
sell me a vacuum cleaner ? set of steak knives ?
i don &apos;t want to sell you anything . i &apos;m not here to do that .
i &apos;m here to tell you that i &apos;m sorry .
i should have known about that memo .
but i didn &apos;t do my job .
if i had , you and i wouldn &apos;t be here right now .
but we are here right now
because of what you did to my husband .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
i never should have done it .
my mother marched , mr. lawyer .
they set dogs on her . i saw the scars .
she said it wasn &apos;t the dogs , it was the men .
i say , put those dogs down .
so you think we should take this deal ?
i think we have to .
just say it .
you want me to cut harvey loose .
you &apos;ve never been afraid to spill blood before .
you means yours .
i was actually referring to when you and i
crossed the other names off the letterhead .
that was for the good of the firm .
was it ?
evidence was destroyed , jessica .
not by harvey .
on his watch , therefore ...
on mine .
if this were anyone else ,
you &apos;d be seeing it the same way i do .
i &apos;m not scapegoating him .
you care about harvey . i know that .
but i also know that you care about your position in this firm .
a law was broken .
are you really going to sit by and do nothing ?
three seven five ? are you insane ? those ...
i &apos;ve got to call you back .
did you get it ?
got it right here ,
fully executed emancipation .
you tell marco yet ?
no , i wanted you to see it first .
nice job .
this way i can call him with the good news .
yeah , just one problem .
what &apos;s that ?
marco lied .
what ?
yeah .
we got backed into a corner ,
and he knew the truth wouldn &apos;t play in court ,
so he made up a story .
if it was a lie , michael ,
then why didn &apos;t oscar say so ?
marco perjured himself .
you really think his father was going to be the one to point that out ?
that &apos;s a lot of conjecture .
yeah , it would be .
but i went to see oscar .
turns out he wasn &apos;t even there when marco ran those laps .
but you were .
nuh @-@ uh , it &apos;s bullshit .
i saw the look on your face in court .
you knew , and you did nothing .
you got me .
but it doesn &apos;t matter , &apos; cause we won .
no , we didn &apos;t .
&apos;cause i &apos;m not filing papers based on a lie .
harvey is gonna make you regret that .
harvey &apos;s not gonna do shit .
this is my case ,
and you are done .
we need to talk .
it &apos;s subtle , but daniel &apos;s strong @-@ arming me .
not now .
my dad .
i was wrong .
am i in the right office ?
i went to the plaintiffs again .
why ?
to tell them i was sorry .
harvey , there is a deal on the table .
allison &apos;s right .
i shouldn &apos;t be the lawyer .
i don &apos;t even make a good client .
neither do i.
but i &apos;ve got some hard news i have to tell you .
okay , let me guess .
you &apos;re here to take me up on my offer to trade offices .
no .
but i did happen to find these .
who still eats twinkies ?
who doesn &apos;t still eat twinkies ?
what &apos;s up ?
i need a favor .
okay , what ?
is this from your tennis client ?
first one .
not as big as harvey &apos;s .
really ? you &apos;re gonna go there ?
it &apos;s probably gonna be worth a lot of money someday .
probably .
i need it .
it &apos;s important .
what for ?
why don &apos;t we just call that my secret ?
daniel ,
will you come to my office right now please ?
have a seat .
couldn &apos;t we have done this in my office ?
yes , we could have , but i prefer to do it here ...
in your old office .
what &apos;s this ?
i want you to let allison holt go .
why would i do that ?
why you ?
because you brought her in initially .
i am extending you the courtesy of letting her go .
as for why at all ,
i do care about my position in this firm
and my position is that we win .
we win .
harvey wins , and i win .
allison holt can &apos;t win ,
because she doesn &apos;t believe in harvey .
i can , because i do .
it &apos;s your decision .
it is .
but don &apos;t try to pass it off as a courtesy .
you &apos;re trying to humiliate me ,
like you did by summoning me into your office .
i summoned you because i wanted you to understand
who you were threatening earlier .
i wasn &apos;t threatening you .
i was pointing out facts .
yes . the fact that , if i &apos;m not careful ,
you &apos;ll try to take this office back .
that &apos;s not going to happen .
and as for your point about a law being broken .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m not going to sit by and do nothing .
louis , can i come in ?
i &apos;m a little busy right now .
where &apos;d you get this ?
i just know what a huge tennis fan you are .
rachel ...
could you just close the door on your way out ?
sure thing , louis .
harvey &apos;s not here . he should be back soon .
i &apos;m not here to see harvey .
he wanted to be the one to have this conversation with you .
but it &apos;s my firm ,
and i wanted you to hear it from me .
am i being fired ?
yes .
i appreciate everything that you &apos;ve done for harvey and for me ,
but whatever my personal feelings ,
your actions have left me no choice
but to terminate your employment at pearson hardman
effective immediately .
you said he was going to fix it .
