Criminal Minds S07E04
10 years ago Randy Slade
entered North Valley high school with a gun and a bomb.
This weekend, the school will try to memorialize
those 13 students that were slain at Slade's hands.
The events will culminate with a candlelight vigil
in memory of the North Valley high massacre.
Principal Doug Givens will read a--
Please...
Please don't do this.
Don't do this.
Can you look me in the eye?
Good-bye, principal Givens.
Don't leave me.
You can't leave me!
What--
No.
No!
Here are Jack's standardized test scores.
Jack tells me you read together
every night you're home.
We just finished
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" last night.
I wish you could work with all of my kids.
So he's reading at a fourth-grade level.
Mm-hmm. As you can see,
his scores are high across the board.
But he seems to be holding back in the classroom.
Why do you think that is?
Has he ever mentioned a classmate named Paul?
Mm-hmm. Paul Cain?
Yes, he's been over. He's a friend of Jack's.
Well, Paul is being mean to Jack for some reason.
How long has that been going on?
A few weeks.
Jack's just his latest target.
We've moved Jack away from Paul,
and we're documenting everything, of course.
Well, Jack says that things are going very well at school,
so the steps you're taking must be working.
Thank you.
Let me know if anything changes.
Absolutely.
Can I keep this?
Sure.
Thank you so much.
Does anyone remember this picture?
Hotch and I were there.
That's principal Doug Givens.
We had to drag him to safety.
High school bombing in Boise, right?
School shooter and school bomber.
A kid named Randy Slade shot 3 students
And then set off an I.E.D. In the cafeteria via cell phone,
killing himself and 13 kids total,
but not before posting all of his plans online.
It was one of those "where were you?" events.
My whole campus was glued to the tv.
Last night, principal Givens was killed by a bomb
modeled exactly like the old one.
It feels like the unsub wants to attack the man
who kept the school together after the bombing.
It's a pretty symbolic target.
And this week is the 10th anniversary of the massacre.
And today is the first day of a 4-day event
to commemorate the bombing at the school.
Except commemorating it isn't enough for this unsub.
No. He wants to relive it.
"You may leave school, but it never leaves you."
Andy Partridge.
Perpetrators of school violence
are often sophisticated with their weapons.
Randy Slade carried his bomb in his backpack.
This guy hid his in Givens' clock radio.
Yeah, and progressive.
Each one tries to top the body count of the one previous.
And they're loners by default, not by choice.
They try to join various social groups, but they get shut out.
Randy Slade wasn't a loner at all.
The family cooperated fully with us.
He was a high-functioning psychopath,
straight-A student, varsity wrestler,
lots of girlfriends.
With an above-average
intelligence that made him incredibly resourceful.
His explosive of choice was semtex.
It's found at demolition sites, but it's held under lock and key.
Which made us consider the possibility of a partner.
Never found one.
Slade was too much of a narcissist to share credit.
But he was also an impulsive teen,
which is what bothers me about this unsub.
His sense of control?
And the end game that he's working toward.
Slade's pathology revolved around the big kill.
This unsub could have done the same
If he'd waited for the candlelight vigil,
which means there's no blaze of glory fantasy here.
This unsub has more bombs made,
And he's savoring the anticipation of his next attack.
Boise police department.
Agent Hotchner.
Chief.
Dave.
Sorry to meet again under these circumstances.
Took your advice and shut down the school.
Was gonna cancel the memorial, too,
but some of the alums
Said they'd go through with it anyway.
Did you get the student files to our technical analyst?
Good. We'll start with criminal records.
What'd you find, Garcia?
A blast from your past, I believe.
Does the name Brandon Slade ring a bell?
Yeah, the bomber's younger brother.
Sweet kid.
He couldn't give us much back then.
Most 7-year-olds don't.
They do, however, grow up to become seniors
who attend the same high school.
Thanks, Garcia.
I thought the Slades we're gonna leave Boise.
They tried, but the network interviews
made them nationwide pariahs.
Did you question Brandon about last night?
He said he was watching pirated movies.
His mom backs him up.
So does his laptop.
We'll need to talk to him.
Ok.
So the unsub has to be
tied to the school somehow, right?
Current student, alumni,
family member who lost someone?
It could be Slade groupie celebrating his hero.
He taped nails to the exterior of the bomb,
specifically to rip open flesh.
That's a sadistic detail of Slade's the unsub copied.
Except he tricked Givens into blowing himself up.
A groupie probably wouldn't show
that much self-control.
But someone with an ax to grind against the principal would.
Maybe he's a surrogate for the tormenters in high school
He can't punish.
Who were yours?
I don't even remember.
You don't even remember?
Wait, were you one of the mean girls?
No.
Valedictorian, soccer scholarship,
Corn-fed, but still a size zero.
I think that you might have been a mean girl.
I was actually one of the nice girls,
even to guys like you.
Guys like me? I'll have you know that my social standing
increased once I started winning at basketball.
Oh, yeah, you played basketball?
I didn't play. I coached basketball.
I broke down the opposing team's shooting strategy.
Is that why Morgan kicked you out of the pool last week?
Yeah. It took him 3 rounds to realize I was hustling him.
Well, it looks like we're
not the only ones interested in Brandon.
It's gonna make it a lot harder for us to talk our way in.
Unless we use it to our advantage.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm SSA david rossi of the FBI.
That's R-O-S-S-I.
So if anyone has any questions, you're free to ask them now.
Does this have anything to do with Brandon Slade?
Mrs. Slade?
I'm special agent Emily Prentiss with the FBI. This is--
Go through my lawyer.
Martha, we can do that. We'll just have to come back later.
Agent Hotchner.
How are you?
What do you want?
To catch the man who killed principal Givens.
Well, then go catch him. But it wasn't my son.
Let us prove that for you.
Once we rule him out, we can get these people off your lawn.
Martha, you can observe. You can stop us and call
your lawyer whenever you want.
Agent Rossi was always very nice to Brandon.
Let him do it.
It's unlikely...
Dave.
All right, feel free to call me
If you have any other background questions.
My phone number is 702-555-0103.
And what's your name, sir?
It's Dr. Spencer Reid. R-E-I-d.
You know, there's a sniper right be--ooh!
Never mind.
When did you become a gamer, old man?
Oh, a while back. After this kid told me
how much he loved playing with his big brother.
Will you sign this for me?
First edition. I'm touched.
You're a good writer.
So are you.
I read one of your ap english essays.
"The futility of Jay Gatsby and the green light."
Where'd you get that?
Well, I was curious as to, uh,
what kind of kid you grew up to be.
Apparently a smart one.
But that didn't stop you
from getting beaten up on a regular basis.
You know how it is with fans.
I mean, you bang yours, mine kick my ass.
And, uh, principal Givens, he couldn't stop that, could he?
That must have really ticked you off.
Listen, I already told the police, ok,
I was watching movies on my computer.
Well, just because you downloaded them
Doesn't mean you sat here and watched them.
You were cool 10 years ago.
So were you.
When did Harry leave?
About 5 years ago.
He got his fresh start,
and I got the underwater mortgage.
Is that why Brandon ended up in North Valley?
I did my best.
But I know my son.
He wouldn't have done this.
Just want to see if you took after your big brother.
You know what, dude? I did it, all right?
So go ahead, cuff me.
Actually, dude, I don't think
You're mean enough to have done it.
But tell me the truth.
You're happy that principal Givens is dead, aren't you?
Yes, I'm happy. It's what Randy wanted.
Well, Randy wanted the whole school dead.
Yeah.
Right.
Whoa. Am I missing something here, Brandon?
No, you got it all figured out.
Well, did Randy have some sort of agenda?
Did he target specific people inside of the school?
Everybody knew who he wanted to take out.
We didn't. We couldn't find any logic to his actions.
So how do you know? Huh?
Did he tell you?
Did a 17-year-old confide in a 7-year-old?
Did you find something?
He had a list, didn't he?
I want my lawyer.
If he still has the list, it's somewhere in that room.
Martha, do you know anything about this?
I can have a search warrant in an hour.
No.
Mom--
Tear it apart.
No--no, mom, please!
Louie, oh, my god.
Chelsea.
Get in here.
I thought this was too lame for you.
No, are you kidding? I wouldn't miss it.
I heard about principal Givens when my flight landed.
How you holding up?
Better, now that I'm on the next flight out of here.
Are you kidding? You can't leave.
I already survived one psychopath.
I'm not about to stare down another.
Yeah, but people need you right now.
You need to show them that
we're not afraid of guys like Randy Slade.
Yeah, well, I am afraid of guys like Randy Slade.
And I'm sick of hearing what people want.
People who weren't in the cafeteria.
People like you.
Just...
Please, go.
Ok?
Lewis, you're not gonna change my mind.
Yeah, bookshelf is clean.
I love dating readers, hate profiling them.
"Catcher in the rye," "Atlas shrugged."
These are all titles that a teenage kid would obsess over,
But Randy made that list when Brandon was just a kid.
You're right.
So, however Brandon got his hands on that list,
He would have hid it in something a 7-year-old would read.
Hotch! We found it.
Principal Givens is on this list.
You're on speaker, JJ.
So we might have another one.
Might?
One of the North Valley alumni was killed in her motel room.
No bomb or gun this time. Looks like he used his bare hands.
You got a name?
Chelsea Grant.
She's on the list.
The unsub crushed Chelsea's throat
so she couldn't scream, then he pulverized her ribs,
sending fragments of bone into her heart.
Principal Givens was high-profile. Chelsea wasn't.
Right now the only thing
connecting them is they're both on the kill list.
A list that Brandon kept secret for 10 years.
But he was in custody when this happened.
The question is, how did the unsub
get the exact same list?
We ruled out a partner, but not conclusively.
Slade made every part of his plan public.
It doesn't make sense that he would hide a partner.
He didn't want to share the credit.
And this weekend is the partner's best chance to claim it.
Partners of dominant psychopaths are usually submissive,
But that doesn't mean that they can't be intelligent
or that they're physically weak.
This unsub laid low after the bombing
and successfully evaded police and FBI.
That took cunning and patience,
Which he's exhibiting now with his current murders.
We think he fits the loner profile Slade debunked.
He grew up in an abusive home,
which kept him from forming
the normal social bonds in high school.
We interviewed all the outcasts from back then.
How did this guy slip through?
Even outcasts eventually form friendships.
But this unsub was the outcast the outcasts rejected.
He won't stand out in any capacity,
And as a matter of fact, most of his fellow students
probably won't even remember graduating with him.
And that invisibility is what made him attractive to Slade.
This partner wouldn't steal the spotlight.
Slade turned to the cafeteria
because most of the names on his list
ate there together during fifth period.
So his hatred festered when the names on the list
emerged from the cafeteria as media heroes.
And now he wants to finish the job that Randy started.
Emotionally, this weekend is
more a high school reunion to him than a memorial.
We go to reunions to show who we grew up to be.
Often that means changing everything about who we were.
Consciously or not, Randy Slade revealed clues
as to his partner's identity when he detonated his bomb.
Agent Prentiss will be conducting cognitive interviews
to see what the survivors might remember.
You want us to walk through what happened that day?
Didn't we do that when we were seniors?
Yes, but there may be some details that
You didn't think were
important at the time that could help us now,
things that could help us learn about the partner.
Randy made us all lie face-down.
I didn't see anything.
None of us did.
Well, that's not true.
Jerry did. He's the guy Randy made lock the doors.
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
The interviews we're going to conduct
won't focus on what you saw, but what you felt.
You want me to tell you how I felt
licking the tile in the cafeteria?
Thanks, I do that at therapy twice a week.
How about how I feel now,
seeing my name on a list of people who should be dead?
The Boise police have offered everyone on this list
a protective detail.
Like that would have done Chelsea any good.
She was killed in her hotel room.
Jerry's not on the list.
Let him help you. I'm out.
Ever get volunteered for a job you don't want?
So, as you can see from your board there,
This kill list is weirdly similar to high school.
Group one is like the popular kids--
Prom court, football team, dean's list.
The heathers, if you will.
Kids in slade's social circle.
What about number two?
Uh, mm-hmm, that would be the kids
from the other side of the tracks,
180-degree difference, kids this close to getting kicked out--
stoners, burnouts, mental cases.
Chelsea Grant is on this list.
Maybe Slade targeted them because they disgusted him?
But they didn't threaten Slade's sense of superiority.
He wouldn't have even cared about them.
All right, well, maybe the partner put them on the list.
They'd be closer to his social status than Slade's.
Why would the--
I'm so sorry.
Why would the unsub list kids that he fit in with?
Apparently that's how this clique worked.
The kids in it were meaner
to each other than kids on the outside.
Garcia, separate out all the kids who got into trouble regularly.
Then eliminate the names that the partner put on the list.
Now, who's left that came to the memorial?
Right. Whoever made the list wouldn't put their name on it.
Sir, I think--
I think I've got him.
Lewis Ramsey.
FBI.
Put the drink down. You're coming with us.
Thanks for doing this.
So, I have some crime scene photos from the day
If you'd like to take a look.
I don't need them.
Ok.
It was 12:50.
Lunch had just started.
It was Thursday.
When did you first notice Randy?
He came in talking on his cell.
Did you hear the conversation?
He was talking to his mom.
But that's not what I noticed first.
What did you notice?
The gun in his hand.
Natalie Gallo, she was the first.
She never even saw it.
Someone asked him what he was doing and he...
What are you doing?
Turned and shot him in the chest.
So, uh... nobody said anything after that.
That was when he ordered you to lock the doors, right?
Jerry, let's go. Lock the doors.
And then he started playing the game.
Yeah.
Randy went table to table.
He was ranting.
What did he say?
I am god.
Now, who's brave enough to look god in the eye?
How about you, Brad?
Can you look me in the eye?
When kids didn't, he shot them.
No?
Allison.
Protect us in our hour...
Allison, stop praying.
Never mind.
He walked up next to me.
How about you?
We were never close, but...
We were always cool.
I don't know what made me think I could do it.
But I did.
I looked him in the eye.
You're not even worth a bullet.
He walked to his backpack...
pulled out the bomb...
And he walked right over there...
He said...
I... Am... God!
And like that, 10 kids were gone.
Those reporters always asked me about that.
Why did he detonate so early?
I still don't know.
Now, let's go back for a second.
Randy was pointing the gun at you.
Did you see the cell phone in his hand?
Yeah.
What was on it?
I--I don't know.
It was the detonator.
All I saw was the black casing.
The black cell phone?
Are you sure?
Yeah. Why?
The gray cell phone was the detonator.
The black cell was the one he'd talked to his mother on.
Uh, that's what I meant,
the--the gray one.
It's just a mistake. Sorry.
I'm telling you, I didn't kill her.
Then how do you explain your fingerprints in her room?
Ok, I saw her last night, but I wouldn't...
She's my friend.
You're very convincing, Lewis.
But you were convincing 10 years ago, too.
So what was your excuse for not being in the cafeteria?
Oh, yeah. You were blazing up in the back parking lot, right?
That wasn't an excuse. It was the truth.
Yeah, of course it was.
It also allowed you to pose as a loser.
The very type you wanted to kill.
You know how we know?
You wrote it down.
"All the losers in this godforsaken school."
I didn't write that one.
But you did type up the rest of the list.
Yes.
Lewis, we know how guys like Randy make friends.
They build up rapport through secrecy.
Only the two of you are smart enough
to see through the bs of high school, right?
And it felt so good doing whatever Randy said
and not have to tell anybody about it.
Make me a list of kids we should kill.
Sure, Randy.
Get me a pound of semtex
from your dad's construction site.
Whatever you say, Randy.
But I never thought that he would--
He would use you?
You were mad that he actually did it.
But you were also mad that he left you behind.
That's not true.
Then why come back?
What does a loser like you
have to gain by seeing all the kids that he hated so much?
I came this close to flushing two years of sobriety
down the toilet tonight.
Not just because chelsea died,
but because I knew that they were gonna cancel that ceremony.
See, tomorrow night
I was gonna tell people what I did.
And I knew that I would be arrested
as an accomplice.
I knew it, but...
I had to.
This is my final amends.
You buy it?
He fits the profile, and the evidence points to him,
but he seems sincere.
He's not the unsub. He was the partner,
but look at how Slade added
"All the losers in this godforsaken school."
This capitalization isn't an accident. Look.
L-S-R--
Lewis Stuart Ramsey.
So slade named his own partner.
Ironically, Lewis' marijuana conviction saved his life.
Well, that puts us back to our original problem.
If the unsub isn't the partner,
how did he get his hands on a list
that Slade and Lewis kept to themselves?
The only answer is that part of the profile is wrong.
The unsub's vendetta has nothing to do with the list.
Did you get anything from Jerry Holtz?
Only that he mixed up the cell phones that Slade used.
It felt like he was making the story up,
But I only had a hunch.
We need to find him now. There's a connection to the victimology
that we're missing. Whatever he's holding back might be the key.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Can you look me in the eye, Jerry?
Look at me!
Look at me! Look at me!
Look at me!
I didn't know!
I didn't know.
That's the point.
They're gonna find out.
Jerry Holtz?
How long?
Less than an hour.
Security guard heard the commotion,
but the unsub was already gone.
The only people who knew we were doing the cognitive interviews
were the other survivors. The unsub must be part of that group.
Well, we don't know that for a fact.
He could have been lying in wait.
Look, Hotch wants me to go through the victims' lives
and find the overlap.
We can compare their histories with the unsub's.
Well, what else do we have to go on?
Spence said the unsub would have broken his hand
beating Chelsea to death. Did you notice anyone
with a cast on their hand, someone who seemed hurt?
No.
I might know why.
This unsub doesn't feel pain.
There's a medical condition called pain asymbolia,
where patients register harmful stimuli
without being bothered by it. They've been documented
holding their hand over an open flame
because their brain
doesn't send pain signals to the central nervous system.
Sounds pretty rare. You sure the unsub has it?
The crime scenes prove it.
This unsub displayed an unusual level
of savagery towards his victims.
And consider this--
He smashed through a glass display case,
but there were not cuts on Jerry.
That means He most likely punched through it as a show of force.
Now, the only way the human body could withstand that level of pain
is if he couldn't feel it at all.
It must take a major toll on someone's emotional development.
A significant contributor to our sense of empathy
is the way we personally experience pain.
And the unsub didn't develop his sense of empathy
because it was cut off.
Does every person with asymbolia have this?
Actually, most feel empathy just fine,
which makes me think the rest of our profile is still accurate.
Loner, invisible,
outcast, boiling rage--
Son of a bitch!
Hi! This is Dr. Spencer Reid. I actually can come to the phone
right now with a very special message that your mother is--
Reid.
Sorry. I'm really sorry.
I don't know what got into me. Where were we?
I'm going to have Garcia check medical records.
What causes asymbolia?
S-s-severe trauma produces lesions in the insular cortex,
usually after a stroke. But this unsub's so young,
It's most likely caused by an external factor.
Like a bomb going off next to him?
Yeah, a bomb going off next to him.
I will crush you.
What?
What?
It's so weird seeing yearbooks again.
A friend of mine who teaches said that Facebook
is making them obsolete.
I'm having serious flashbacks going through these senior bios.
Four years of accomplishments boiled down to one paragraph.
Hey, did your school have anything called "Top 10"?
Mm, no. Is it an academic thing?
No, I don't think so.
Only 10 of the survivors listed it,
Including Jerry and Chelsea,
And neither one of them were valedictorian material.
Ok, so... What are we looking at here?
Well, maybe it's a clique inside a clique.
Yeah, but it's jocks, nerds, theater geeks.
Nothing that would bring these kids together.
Except...
What?
I know what the Top 10 is.
Hey, Tiffany.
Where you going?
Uh, there's gonna be a get-together
for the survivors.
Didn't you hear? They canceled the vigil.
I know.
That's why some of us are getting together
at the seven stars restaurant later.
Great. I'll join you.
I would love that,
but it's kind of a top 10 thing.
Well, top 8 now.
You understand, right?
Totally.
Tell everyone I say hi.
Ok.
Recognize the Top 10?
No.
They were the students
that went in front of the cameras after the bombing.
I thought all the surviving students were interviewed.
After the initial aftermath, yes,
but these are the kids that went on talk shows,
traveled to other schools.
My guess is that they didn't self-select who made the cut.
Principal Givens did.
That's why the unsub killed him first.
He was an outcast who wanted to fit in.
Being a survivor should have been his golden ticket.
But he was excluded again, and that's why he's killing them.
Yeah. The rules of high school never changed,
Not even after a tragedy.
Go ahead, Garcia.
Hey, listen up.
I cross-referenced student files with medical records.
Now, there were 6 kids
that were knocked unconscious in that blast,
but only one fits the outcast profile.
His name is Robert Adams,
and he just used his credit card at a local restaurant,
the address of which... I just sent you right now.
I'm on my way.
It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever done in my life.
I didn't want to do it,
but Jerry said we can't-- well, we lost the bet.
It was just very uncomfortable for everybody.
Oh, god.
You ok?
Is everybody ok?
Sit down!
Don't move!
Sit down!
Hope I'm not interrupting.
Is it that hard
for you people
to tell the truth about me?
To notice me?!
Like you.
Do you even know my name?
Ralph?
Guess again.
He's holding hostages in the restaurant.
They're clearing the upper floors now.
We got this video feed from the security camera.
Two entrances-- the front, the kitchen.
Either way he can see us coming.
He's nowhere near the window, so there's no line of sight.
Yeah, but why take them hostage at all?
If this is a vendetta, why not kill them now?
We profiled this would be like a reunion to him.
He wants people to recognize who he is.
I think I know what he wants to be recognized for.
Get up. Get up!
Robert Adams, we're with the FBI.
We just want to talk to you.
You better drop those guns if you just want to talk.
We know why you're doing this, Bob.
It's pretty obvious, isn't it?
Before tonight, they didn't know my name!
But now...
No one will forget it.
Bob, you'll be in the news for a couple of days.
But no one will know the real story.
What story is that?
Tiffany...
What did Randy say to the kid who looked him in the eye?
He...He said Jerry wasn't worth a bullet.
But he didn't say it to Jerry, did he, Bob?
Did he, Bob?
How about you?
No.
He said it to me.
I was the only one brave enough to stare him down,
but his bomb knocked me out,
and when I woke up,
there was Jerry on the tv telling my story!
My story!
And nobody got to find out
that Bob Adams was a good kid.
A brave kid. The kind of kid you'd want to hang out with.
We can give you back your story, Bob,
but you have to drop the gun.
Isn't it funny when your dream comes true...
It's never the way you want.
Bob.
Drop the gun.
Morgan, he's heading to the south entrance.
Copy. I got the back covered.
He's going in the boiler room.
I'm on my way.
FBI. Drop the weapon, Bob.
Prentiss, in here!
Hotch!
We need medical in the boiler room.
Hold your fire.
That... didn't... Hurt!
"Pain is the breaking of the shell
that encloses your understanding."
Kahlil Gibran.
We interrupt your regularly scheduled
musical selection with an important announcement.
Never wage a practical joke war against an M.I.T. Graduate,
because we have a history of going nuclear.
Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the dulcet sounds
of me screaming in your ear.
Ok, kid, that was cute.
But that's all you got?
Hey, baby gi--
All right, Reid, it's on.
Just know that paybacks are a bitch.
How's Jack?
I just had a feeling.
There's a kid that's being mean to him at school,
And Jack's solution is to
invite him over and make friends with him.
That is the sweetest
and saddest thing I've heard.
How did you find out?
His teacher told me.
Jack didn't tell you?
Oh, that must be hard.
He wants to solve it himself.
And you want to let him.
But there's probably a part of you
that wishes you could step in.
Well, there's a part of me that wants to protect him
from everything that could hurt him, but I know I can't.
No.
But you can show him that he doesn't have to face it alone.
How did you get by in Paris?
Um, I, um...
I played a lot of online scrabble...
with some girl named Cheeto Breath.
At this time, we'd like you to call out names of people
who were hurt or died,
people you'd like to remember.
Jerry Holtz.
Jay O'brien.
Steve Tossell.
Tucker Cranwell.
Allison Humwald.
Janine Bergen.
Natalie Gallo.
Randy Slade.
Why are we doing this?
We haven't talked to mom in a while,
So I thought it would be a good idea if we did it again.
But I don't want to make you sad.
Buddy, you're not making me sad.
It makes me happy,
because it reminds me what a great job mom did with you.
So maybe if we got in the habit of doing this again,
you know, mom could help us.
Like with what?
You know, if you have a bad day.
Mrs. Mckee said Paul's been mean to you.
He hasn't been mean to me.
No?
Ok.
Well, mom, look out for Jack anyway.
Dad, too.
Oh, dad, too. Of course.
Good job.
Ok. Time to settle down.
Good night, buddy.
Love you, dad.
