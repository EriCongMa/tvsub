her name &apos;s sophia . that &apos;s my half sister .

but it turns out i still have some stuff
i have to work through .

is lena gonna be ok ?
yeah , now , but she lost the baby .
sometimes i &apos;m afraid
that they &apos;re not gonna love me as much as i love them .
biology or not ,
everybody &apos;s afraid that our children
won &apos;t love us the way we love them .
what &apos;s taking so freaking long ? did you fall in ?
i &apos;m about to leak .
go downstairs .
jude &apos;s in the bathroom downstairs .
are you sure ... are you sure you don &apos;t want me to come with you ?
&apos;cause i , i don &apos;t mind .
no , i know .
i think it &apos;s better if it &apos;s just me and jude .
i want him to get to know sophia ,
so he doesn &apos;t feel so , you know , threatened .
and i don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna do that if you &apos;re there .
ok .
and have you decided about what you &apos;re gonna tell robert
about the college fund ?
i &apos;m gonna say thanks
but i don &apos;t want anything from you ,
and that includes your money .

you and i could use a quiet afternoon at home ,
just the two of us .
ok ?
thank you , i love you .
love you .
good morning .
hey , morning .
how you feeling ?
oh , as good as could be expected , i guess .

we need to tell .
good shove .

all right ?
nice match .
that &apos;s it ?
what ? what do you want , jesus ?
i don &apos;t know . i just ... i just want us to be cool .
i am such an idiot .
i was stupid enough to think
the first words out of your mouth would be &quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
i am sorry .
i should have never let mariana open her big mouth
about me and hayley .
but don &apos;t forget , you broke up with me .
and you waited like five seconds to replace me .
makes me feel like a real winner , foster .
how was i supposed to know you wanted to get back together ?
i &apos;m not doing this anymore .
everything &apos;s cool , ok ?
we never should &apos;ve dated in the first place .
i mean , if hayley &apos;s what you want , well ,
i think we both know she &apos;s everything i &apos;m not ,
and nothing that i want to be .
but i think it &apos;s time that you find a new tutor .
hey , you &apos;re here early .
what was that all about ?
some team stuff .
you ok ?
we are so happy you guys could make it .
soph &apos;s been talking about it for days .
dad , shut up .
sophia .
sorry .
i &apos;m just ... so excited to finally meet you , jude .
and for you to finally meet our dad .
i mean ...
yeah , jude and i already have a dad .
his name &apos;s donald .
right . yeah , i know .
sophia , why don &apos;t you come help me put out lunch ?
you guys really do look alike , even more in person .
you think ?
i guess , a little .
so which side is port ?
uh ... this one .
why don &apos;t you just say &quot; left ? &quot;
well , you don &apos;t want there to be any confusion , you know ?
in case somebody &apos;s facing the opposite direction ,
or if something goes wrong .
come on .
lena , i &apos;m home !
i &apos;m in the living room .
hi .
hey , honey .
what &apos;s going on ?
you expecting someone ?
hey .
hi , what &apos;s up ?
lena called , said you wanted to talk ?
i do ?
what &apos;s going on , love ?
is this about the surgery ? you changed your mind ?
no , this isn &apos;t about his hand .
uh , brandon has something to tell you both ,
something important ,
and i &apos;d like everyone to promise that no one leaves this house
until we all agree how to handle this together ,
as a family .
ok .
ok , so ... what &apos;s with the buildup ?
what are we talking about ?
it &apos;s about dani .
i knew it .
i knew you had a problem with her , brandon .
no , no , it &apos;s ...
b ?
this is hard for him to say , just give him a minute .
brandon , please , tell me that this isn &apos;t what i &apos;m thinking .
what are you thinking ?
brandon , what happened ?
did dani do something ?
excuse me ?
brandon was in a vulnerable position ...
no , no , no .
i want to hear it from him .
the night you kicked dani out of the house ,
she came back to get her stuff ,
and i ...
... i had a few beers .
and my audition for symphony was the next day ,
so she , uh ...
told me to go to bed , sleep it off ,
so she helped me undress ...
... and ...
... and it just sort of happened .
what happened ?
we had sex .
what the hell do you mean you had sex ?
obviously he was seduced .
no , i was ... i was drunk , and i wasn &apos;t thinking .
it &apos;s my fault .
drunk ? you were drunk ? did dani give you the booze ?
no , no , i was upset and ...
oh , my god , i can &apos;t believe you did not break up with that woman
when you had the chance .
you knew that she could not be trusted ,
but you are so pathetic !
so this is my fault ?
i didn &apos;t say that it was your fault , but i &apos;m just saying ...
that was exactly what you said .
you said that i didn &apos;t break up with her .
i can &apos;t believe that i let you have custody .
oh , brandon &apos;s been so perfect under your rule .
stop it !
god , i never should have told you .
brandon !
brandon !
brandon ! i &apos;m so ...
let him go .
what the hell is wrong with you guys ?
stef , why are you acting like this is mike &apos;s fault ?
and mike , i know that you are hurt
and this is confusing as hell ,
but can &apos;t you see what this is doing to your son ?
hey , i &apos;m taking off .
am i seeing you tonight ?
oh , no , remember ?
i have that dinner at coach &apos;s house .
dinner ?
i told you .
the one where he gives out all the goofy awards and stuff ?
and somebody is getting &quot; most improved , &quot; right ?
that &apos;s the rumor .
is emma gonna be there ?
this is a team dinner , and she &apos;s on the team .
ok , let &apos;s go !
call me later ?
promise .
we don &apos;t have time to mess around today .
competition season starts this month ,
and we are not losing this year .
and here &apos;s the thing : we need to talk dollars .
our first competition is in l.a. ,
and the truth is , we don &apos;t have enough money for everyone to go .
we don &apos;t ?
at least one of us , and maybe even two , can &apos;t go .
well , what if we have like a car wash or something ?
we &apos;re not allowed , remember ?
clubs and teams can &apos;t do any &quot; extra &quot; fundraising .
so , if you &apos;re planning on holding anything back
in rehearsal today ... don &apos;t .
all right , let &apos;s get started .
hayley , you lead the warm @-@ up .
callie , you wanna try ?
no ?
mm @-@ mm , no .
jude , how about you ?
come on ! get in here !
what are you gonna hit , an iceberg ?
get up there .
there you go .
feels good , right ? steering the ship ?
oh , look out ! i &apos;m kidding .
i was kidding . i was kidding , relax .
how do you know where you &apos;re going ?
oh , i have this gps right here .
have you ever gotten lost ?
ah , once , yeah , when i was sailing .
really ?
yeah , i got lost in some really rough water ,
but actually between us , it was pretty awesome .
sounds pretty terrible .
no , no , it was an adventure .
i mean , was i scared ? yeah , i was .
but , you know , sometimes you just have to let go ,
give up control , turn it over to the stars .
you know ?
hey , jude ...
listen , i know learning that callie had this
whole &quot; other family &quot; has been crazy ,
but i don &apos;t want you to be scared .
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you , i wanna get to know callie .
and you , too , if you &apos;re open to it .
but i &apos;m never gonna try and replace your father .
and no matter what , you and callie still share that ,
ok ? and you always will .
演唱者 christina perr
hey , back row ?
try and land that floor work clean , please ?
you look like you &apos;re having a seizure .
ignore her , she &apos;s just stressed .
ok , let &apos;s take it from the top of the second section .
five , six , seven , eight .
mariana , can you come here , please ?
tia , can you show her how to do the floor work , please ?
that is how you do it .
if you can &apos;t land it like that ,
then you &apos;re not going to competition .
ok , take five .
and &quot; five &quot; means five , people .
hey , look , it just takes time . ok , you &apos;ll get it .
i just ... i don &apos;t want to get cut from the team .
well , i mean , i happy to ... you know , work on it with you .
if you want .
yeah ?
ok , so it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s just drag , hands , sweep it to the floor .
ok , but you gotta trust . ok , try it .
no , see , you gotta go for it .
ok , you &apos;re holding yourself back .
i don &apos;t know . i guess ...
... all the contemporary and the hip @-@ hop we &apos;ve been doing lately
just doesn &apos;t come as natural to me .
excuse me ?
you know what i mean .
uh , no , i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t . do you care to explain ?
well , i mean , you &apos;re just so good ,
you make the rest of us look bad .
well , there &apos;s nothing i can do about that .
well , i mean , you could try to blend in .
this is a dance team , you know ?
what ? should i dye my hair ?
you know what ? um , why don &apos;t you just work it out on your own .
good luck .
b ?
i &apos;m glad you told us .
i &apos;m not .
you understand that dani was the adult in this situation .
and that you &apos;re a minor .
yes .
and that means that what happened was illegal .
mom ...
you &apos;re the victim here . b.
i &apos;m not a victim .
honey , i handle a lot of these cases ,
and it is common that the boys don &apos;t think they &apos;ve been raped .
the difference is that i &apos;m not one of your cases .
i was there . i know what i did .
and i &apos;d appreciate it if you &apos;d stop telling me
how i should feel about it .
i get that you might not see it this way now ...
... but dani broke the law and she needs to be prosecuted .
well , i &apos;m not gonna cooperate .
i &apos;ll say you &apos;re lying or that i made it up .
this is ... completely humiliating .
i &apos;m not telling the police , and you can &apos;t make me .
i love your jeans .
oh , thanks .
i wanna get some like those , mom .
ok , we &apos;ll see what we can find .
so , tell me about your school .
it &apos;s so cool that you guys are right on the beach .
archfield &apos;s so ... uptight .
uptight ? what does that mean ?
you know , the uniforms and rules and everything .
it &apos;s a lot .
well , yeah , even though it &apos;s on the beach ,
it &apos;s not really a day at one .
it &apos;s actually pretty tough ,
definitely the hardest school i &apos;ve ever been to .
i &apos;ve been to a lot , you know ?
how many ?
um , seven , i guess , all together .
wow , i feel like such a nerd right now .
i &apos;ve only been to one school my entire life .
but you love archfield .
not really .
since when ?
since forever .
well , i think archfield sounds really cool .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . you were talking about
the trips you guys go on every year ?
where &apos;d you go last fall ?
barcelona ?
right , barcelona . we &apos;re not doing that at anchor beach .
well , all we did was walk around the street
and go to museums and stuff .
what about all those beautiful photographs you took ?
you take pictures ?
me , too .
still , i think you &apos;re really lucky .
i &apos;d love to go to spain .
it seems so cool and artsy and romantic .
it might be . there weren &apos;t any boys .
archfield &apos;s all girls .
and we &apos;re a little young for romance anyway .
you know , callie has a boyfriend .
oh , really ?
his name &apos;s wyatt . he &apos;s super hot .
um , yeah , we &apos;re just taking a little break right now .
how come ?
callie , you gotta come see the engine room .
it &apos;s crazy . it &apos;s like something out of the golden compass .
cool . excuse me .
i understand you &apos;re trying to impress callie ,
but being rude to your mother is not the way to do it .
b never liked dani .
maybe ... maybe he &apos;s trying to get rid of her .
you know ? i mean , he could be lying .
he &apos;s not lying , mike .
where are you going ? mike ?
i just want to talk to her .
i just wanna find out what she has to say for herself .
mike , you promised that you would stay here
and figure this out with us together .
so brandon won &apos;t ... he doesn &apos;t want us to press charges .
well , that &apos;s not really surprising , is it ?
wait , wait , wait . press charges for what ?
for statutory rape .
you think brandon was raped ?
you think dani raped brandon ?
mike , you know the definition of ...
come on , stef ! he knew what he was doing .
so , he &apos;s not an adult .
he &apos;s 16 !
trust me , dani didn &apos;t force him .
i know how a 16 @-@ year @-@ old boy thinks .
that is not the issue here .
i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t ...
mike . mike ! you promised .
i need a minute . i &apos;ll be out back .
so was your mom bummed when she got passed over for principal ?
no , um , it was for the best .
i mean , she already has a lot on her plate .
um , wait , lena &apos;s your mom ?
lena the vice @-@ principal ?
yeah , i &apos;m adopted .
oh , um , nice .
you &apos;re lucky . i wish i was adopted .
my parents are the worst .
but what about your real parents ?
i mean , do you know anything about them ?
stef and lena are my real parents .
right . sorry , but you know what i mean .
no , it was a closed adoption .
i don &apos;t know anything about them .
that would drive me crazy wondering who they are .
yeah , don &apos;t you want to find them ?
you know , at least to see if you look like them ?
um , you know what i was thinking about ?
how we don &apos;t have any money for the competition .
let me talk to my mom and see what i can do .
i mean , the new principal hasn &apos;t started yet ,
she &apos;s still in charge , right ?
i think ... i think i &apos;m gonna stay here .
are you sure ?
yeah , i feel a little seasick .
you guys go ahead .
we &apos;re just going to the ship &apos;s store across the marina .
i &apos;ll keep him occupied .
yeah , great . come on , let &apos;s go .
well , we won &apos;t be long . promise .
all right . callie , wanna drive ?
yeah !
all right .
turn the key .
all right ?
yeah , go back .
oops ! a little bit . just a little bit .
perfect .
ok .
nice .
i &apos;m in neutral , right ?
yeah , now turn it around to the right a little bit .
there you go . ok , that &apos;s cool .
and forward ?
yeah .
there you go , looking good .
nice and slow .
put it in reverse .
just for a second . there you go . perfect .
ah , there we go . all right .
ok .
tie it on for us .
here we go .
look at that , huh ? she &apos;s a natural .
all right !
all right .
i &apos;m gonna get a few things .
ok .
i &apos;ll be back in a flash , and don &apos;t rock the boat .
he is such a nerd .
he seems like a good dad .
yeah , he is .
you know , it must be weird for you ,
just being here .
kind of like seeing what would have happened if
our dad would have stayed with your mom .
well , kinda , yeah .
but , you know , everything happens for a reason .
if you think about it ,
if your dad would have stayed with my mom ,
there &apos;d be no jude .
and there &apos;d be no you .
yeah , might not be such a bad thing .
sounds like you and callie found a wonderful home .
yeah , i mean , we didn &apos;t grow up together but ...
the fosters really feel like our brothers and sisters .
and callie &apos;s happy ?
yeah .
as happy as callie can be , anyway .
so , um , why did she run away ?
she thought they might not want to adopt both of us .
why did she think that ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , it &apos;s not true , right ?
they still want to adopt her , right ?
oh , yeah . totally .
they &apos;re just ... waiting on you guys .
why not ?
because those are the rules , mariana .
people were taking advantage
and using things like bake sales and car washes
to funnel a ton of money into their own kids &apos; programs ,
and the parent board decided that it wasn &apos;t fair .
but can &apos;t you , like , bend the rules , just this once ?
i mean , aren &apos;t you the acting principal ?
but how would that look if i start making exceptions
for my own kids ?
the answer is no . period .
fine , thanks for nothing .
you &apos;re welcome .
what are you doing at school on a saturday ?
band practice .
&quot; someone &apos;s little sister &quot; ?
no , uh , the other one . nerd band .
you ?
dance team .
how was it ?
well , um , we have competitions coming up in a couple weeks ,
so kaitlyn is on a rampage .
and we don &apos;t have enough money for everyone to go to l.a. ,
so i asked my mom if she would help us raise some money
but she said no ...
i love being on the team
and i just feel like they &apos;re gonna cut me as soon as ...
hey , whoa . slow down .
why are you looking for a backup plan ?
what does that have to do with dancing ?
i &apos;m not as good as everyone else is .
so work harder .
but i &apos;m never going to be as good as they are .
well , not as long as you believe that you &apos;re not .
why are you always up in my grill ?
&quot; up in your grill ? &quot;
how about i tell you this friday night ?
hmm , sounds fun . a movie and a lecture .
yeah , how about we don &apos;t .
uh , so , no movie then ?
i can &apos;t believe that mike thinks that
dani is gonna have some miraculous explanation for this ,
some &quot; side &quot; that he needs to hear .
stef .
what ?
you &apos;re acting like mike is to blame here .
do you honestly think ,
if he had any inkling this was going to happen ,
that he would &apos;ve have asked her to move in ?
can you imagine how humiliated he must be .
i can only imagine how many red flags he ignored .
he has terrible taste in women .
he married a lesbian .
and you married a man .
we all have our blind spots , stef .
just don &apos;t be so hard on him .
there &apos;s only one person here to be angry with , and that &apos;s dani .
i &apos;m ... you think that i &apos;m hard on him ?
stef .
what ?
the only person in the world
you &apos;re harder on than mike is yourself .
any time the kids make a mistake or , hell ,
anyone you love makes a mistake ,
you take it all personally , like you failed us ,
like you think you should &apos;ve been able to protect us
from ourselves somehow .
and i think that that extends to mike .
but with mike , it &apos;s even worse ,
because on top of everything else , you feel guilty .
about ?
about leaving , about hurting him .
well , don &apos;t i sound like an ass .
you &apos;re not an ass , honey , not even a little bit .
you just ... love hard .
that &apos;s a good thing .
but that &apos;s why brandon came to you about this , right ?
because i &apos;m so hard on everyone ?
演唱者 christina perr
hey , what are you still doing here ?
practicing .
yeah , like you need to practice .
look , i know ...
i know you think these moves come to me naturally
because i &apos;m black but ...
i &apos;m just kidding .
look , i &apos;m sorry about earlier .
so could i ...
would you ... help me ?
let &apos;s do this .
right , let &apos;s do this .
are you ok ?
no .
me neither .
at least we agree on that .
i still don &apos;t understand how this could happen .
how i could let it happen .
but you &apos;re right about one thing , this is my fault .
it &apos;s not ... it &apos;s not your fault , mike .
i love you , mike , i do ,
and i &apos;m really sorry that i &apos;ve been so hard on you .
it &apos;s a ...
thanks but it wasn &apos;t exactly easy being married to me .
the problems in our marriage were not all your fault .
i wasn &apos;t exactly mrs. brady .
you had her hair , remember ?
right after we got married , the mullet ?
i beg your pardon that was not a mullet .
that was a blunt , layered flip .
yeah , you keep telling yourself that ,
but i have photographic evidence .
i don &apos;t blame you for the divorce , stef .
and we can &apos;t blame brandon for what happened with dani .
he made some bad decisions , like drinking for one .
i hope to god i didn &apos;t pass that on to him .
but he &apos;s sixteen .
what if this were mariana ?
she &apos;s almost sixteen .
what if she &quot; agreed &quot;
to have sex with a teacher at school ?
would you blame her ?
i mean , what would you do ?
i &apos;d lock him up .
so why is brandon any different ?
hey , jude .
get her to show you a sheet bend , she needs the practice .
i took those the summer we met .
i can &apos;t believe you held onto them .
so ... stef told me that you had some concerns
about accepting the college fund .
you don &apos;t need to feel guilty , ok ?
i don &apos;t need a consolation prize or a parting gift .
i have my own plan .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m working , to save up for college .
well , that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s great but , you know , it &apos;s hard to work and study .
and it &apos;s gonna take you years to save up for a semester .
your mother would have wanted you to go to college .
you know , she was always talking about ...
finishing her degree .
do you know if she ever went back ?
uh , she took a couple night classes .
don &apos;t you think she would &apos;ve wanted this for you ?
let me do this . please , callie , for her .
i owe her that much .
at least to help make her dreams for you come true .
can i keep this one ?
you can keep any one you want .
i &apos;m sorta jealous you knew her then ,
when she was young and had her whole life ahead of her .
yeah .
it must &apos;ve been hard to lose her so young .
thank you .
for being so welcoming with jude .
and ... for the college fund .
i &apos;d be stupid to turn that down , right ?
i think it &apos;s time we took the kids home .
yeah , ok . i &apos;ll get jude .
thanks for coming , it was a really nice day .
tommy &apos;s here . see you later , moms !
don &apos;t be out late !
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s my parents .
what &apos;s wrong ? is everything ok ?
they &apos;re getting a divorce .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
i just don &apos;t want to be alone tonight .
you know i have that , um , team dinner .
oh , i forgot . i &apos;m sorry .
of course i can &apos;t ask you to skip it .
i &apos;ll be ok .
wait , wait , wait .
no , wait . i &apos;ll come with you .
are you sure ?
yeah .
just tell the guys that they don &apos;t have to come pick me up .
thanks .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do without you .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i wish i could take it back .
or at least tell you why i did it .
i want you to be very careful when it comes to drinking , brandon .
i don &apos;t want you ending up like me .
god knows , i &apos;ve made a lot of bad decisions
when i &apos;ve been drunk .
dad , i know how excited you were to start over ...
... how much you wanted to make a life with dani .
and i ruined it .
no , brandon , dani &apos;s the adult .
she had the responsibility to stop it ,
no matter how it started .
and you might not feel this way , but what she did was illegal .
and we have to do something about it .
演唱者 christina perr
jesus , come in here .
hey .
so , how &apos;d it go ? the wrestling thing ?
did you win &quot; most improved &quot; ?
i didn &apos;t even go .
what ? why ?
hayley stopped by . she was a total mess .
her parents are getting divorced .
well , she was really upset .
about what ?
about the fact that her parents are getting divorced .
why are you being so mean ?
hayley &apos;s known about this for months .
no , no . well , it seemed like they just told her .

so ... moment of truth .
what &apos;d you think ?
to be honest ...
i wish you &apos;d never found out about them .
well , thank you for telling me .
that wasn &apos;t that hard , was it ?
yeah , i don &apos;t have to see them again ...
wait , i &apos;m not done .
i wish you never found out about them ,
but that &apos;s not gonna change anything .
it sucks that i have to share you .
but i guess if i learned how to do it with the fosters ,
then i can do it with sophia , too .
and ... robert and jill ,
they seem pretty nice .
you &apos;re the best , you know that ?
so did you have fun today ?
it &apos;s the best day ever .
good , i &apos;m glad .
you know , i wish we could adopt callie .
well , technically , we wouldn &apos;t have to adopt her ,
but she &apos;s already got a family . a family that loves her .
yeah , i know . but she &apos;s only been with them for a few months .
maybe if she knew us longer , she could learn to love us , too .
