nanny dearest
watch it ! let &apos;s keep the water in the tub , okey ?
five more minutes ,
and then mommy is gonna get ready for work .
why did you always go to work , mommy ?
well , um , because there &apos;s people out there that need my help .
but i will be back soon .
how many days ?
i don &apos;t know , buddy . i wish i did .
but i promise i will be back as soon as i can .
and we always keep our promises , right ?
yeah .
yeah .
ok , well , then you need to promise
that you &apos;re gonna be a good boy for daddy while i &apos;m gone .
give me a high five .
we &apos;re gonna make a pre @-@ emptive trip to los angeles .
this unsub kills on the same date every year .
go ahead , garcia .
ok . i present to you , crime @-@ fighters ,
an oldie but not such a goodie .
i give you rachel hughes ,
melissa martinez ,
tara rios , diana brooks ,
and gloria clemente .
you guys know the deets . this is news to you , blake .
over the last 5 years , each of these women
have disappeared from a park
off the california coast ,
from as far south as san diego and far north as san francisco .
each of them were nannies who were kidnapped while watching kids .
thankfully , each of the little ones
was returned to a church or hospital totally unharmed within 24 hours .
but the nannies were found dead , posed on park benches
and los angeles playgrounds .
one a year , always on the same date .
may 13 . the actual abduction date varies from case to case ,
but the unsub goes to great lengths
to make sure the bodies are found that exact day .
all except victim number 3 , tara rios .
somehow she managed to escape .
garbage truck driver found
her passed out in an alley in hollywood .
she had no idea who took her or where he held her .
morgan and i questioned her ,
i even tried to do cognitive ,
but she was way too traumatized
to remember much of anything at all .
clearly she dissociated from the event .
we &apos;ve contacted her several times over the past few years
trying to get more info ,
but she just refuses to talk to us .
her reluctance isn &apos;t surprising .
each of the victims was sexually assaulted
and tortured with burning implements for several days .
and then he drowned them in scalding water when he was done .
but no matter where he grabs them ,
he always returns them to l.a.
both the location and that date
obviously means something significant , but what ?
may 13 is two weeks away .
garcia , go ahead and alert the press on the west coast .
when we land in l.a. ,
morgan and jj will take the jet to seattle
and make a personal plea to tara rios .
wheels up in 30 .
ok , see you guys next week .
bye .
bye . miss gina .
i want to go feed the birds .
you hungry for lunch ?
we got some mac and cheese .
maybe you &apos;ll actually eat your broccoli today .
you got your hands full , huh ?
cute . what is she , about 2 ?
yeah , almost .
what &apos;s her name ?
phoebe .
hi , phoebe . my daughter &apos;s almost 8 .
enjoy your day .
you , too .
it &apos;s okey , baby .
hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
it &apos;s ok .
just shut your mouth .
don &apos;t make me hurt the baby instead .
hi , phoebe .
&quot; children are educated by what the grownup is
and not by his talk . &quot;
carl jung .
other than their occupation ,
there &apos;s no connection between these victims .
his need to commemorate the anniversary is what &apos;s behind it
and whatever message he &apos;s trying to send .
and what exactly is he trying to say ?
well , whatever it is , this anniversary date
has to be associated with some kind of long @-@ term stressor .
that date could be anything .
birthdate , death date , a traumatic event .
his first victim , rachel hughes ,
was the only one be both kidnapped and dumped
in griffith park .
well , the first time is usually the most significant .
newsflash , my family ,
and how i wish it was the good kind .
another nanny and a kid just disappeared in los angeles .
her name is gina mendes .
she was watching a 2 @-@ year @-@ old named phoebe payton .
think that &apos;s our guy ?
i &apos;d bet on it .
i think he &apos;s ahead of schedule .
he &apos;s never abducted his victims
more than 4 days before the anniversary date .
访谈室
phoebe &apos;s got asthma .
and she needs regular nebulizer treatments .
gina always carries some , but it won &apos;t last .
how long has gina worked for you ?
oh , about 4 years .
that &apos;s a long time .
the baby is barely 2 .
yeah . we hired her when we got pregnant ...
the first time .
i &apos;m sorry , the first time ?
i had a late miscarriage ,
and then we had a stillbirth .
gina stayed on .
you know , we were both pretty shook up ,
and i travel a lot for work .
so , she helped out around the house .
gina doesn &apos;t just work for us , she &apos;s like family .
she lost both her parents when she was a teenager ,
so it &apos;s kind of like we adopted her in a way .
it &apos;s true , right ? this man , he always--
he always gives the kids back ?
yes , he has .
and they &apos;re ok ?
he doesn &apos;t--
he &apos;s returned all of the children unharmed
in the first 24 hours , either to a church or to a hospital .
oh , god .
she needs her medicine .
she has asthma .
please , let me help her .
boo @-@ hoo @-@ hoo .
you all pretend to care ,
but you just want to save your own skin .
you &apos;re all the same .
she &apos;ll die !
she &apos;ll die if you can &apos;t take the pain .
in their statements , two of the other families
said the same thing about their nannies .
&quot; she was more than just an employee .
she was almost like family . &quot;
well , it &apos;s not uncommon to form that kind of a bond
with your child &apos;s caregiver .
but what if the connection they have with the children
is what sparks the unsub &apos;s interest ?
maybe it &apos;s not just about them being nannies .
he could be keying in on the relationship itself .
and he would have to stalk them and know
their routines well enough to be able to pick up on that .
i &apos;ll have reid and rossi retrace gina &apos;s steps ,
and we should interview the victims &apos; families again .
if he sticks to his schedule ,
phoebe could turn up soon .
let &apos;s hope so .
i just talked to a bunch of nannies over at the observatory .
they knew gina and phoebe .
said they &apos;re here every , uh , tuesday and thursday .
a regular schedule or routine
gives children a sense of security .
that would make it easy for him to stalk her .
he knew exactly when she would be here .
she never made it back to the car ,
which means he grabbed her
somewhere between here and the observatory .
broad daylight , public park ,
lapd regularly patrolling the area .
this guy &apos;s got cojones .
he probably threatens the children
as a means to gain the nanny &apos;s compliance .
well , we know he &apos;s got his own transport .
it &apos;s gotta be a van or an suv .
and he &apos;s patient . he only kills once a year .
the rest of the time , he &apos;s stalking or planning .
one thing &apos;s different , though . he &apos;s back in griffith park .
coincidence ?
griffith park spans 4,310 acres ,
making it one of the largest urban parks on all of north america .
given the sheer size , coincidence certainly is a possibility .
but he &apos;s never repeated parks before .
no , he hasn &apos;t .
hey , tara .
it &apos;s been a long time .
what are you guys doing here ?
we need to talk to you .
well , you should have called me first .
we did . you never called us back .
you have no right just showing up to my work like this .
we apologize , but this is--
couldn &apos;t you just talk to my doctor ?
he knows everything that &apos;s going on with me .
the unsub took another nanny today , tara .
her name &apos;s gina mendes--
stop . stop it .
i don &apos;t want to know her name .
tara , we really need your help .
i already told you guys everything that i can remember .
tara , that was 3 years ago .
we &apos;re hoping that you &apos;ll give it another try .
your memories aren &apos;t lost ,
they &apos;re just locked up .
we know this is a lot ...
but we &apos;ll be with you the whole time .
the little girl who was with gina ,
her name &apos;s phoebe ,
and she has asthma and she needs special medication .
and--and gina ,
right now she &apos;s going through exactly what you went through .
which means if we don &apos;t find her ,
she &apos;s only got two weeks to live .
tara ?
tara ?
please .
help us .
no .
lapd &apos;s got every church and hospital in the city covered .
so far nothing .
maybe the police presence scared him off .
they &apos;re only using plainclothes .
even so , this guy has evaded arrest for this long .
he &apos;s probably got a nose for cops .
i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s a creature of habit .
veering off his schedule would be a big departure in his m.o.
he &apos;s already veering from his schedule , though .
i mean , he abducted gina earlier than expected .
he never keeps the children longer than 24 hours .
he &apos;s had phoebe for 28 .
i wonder what that means for gina .
will he stick to his schedule with her ?
he returned all 5 of the other kids .
why is he holding phoebe ?
we should consider the implications
if he doesn &apos;t bring her back .
agent hotchner .
yes .
have you heard anything ?
no , nothing yet . i &apos;m sorry .
so ... so what now ?
we keep pursuing the investigation .
we leave no stone unturned .
but you said he always gives the kids back within 24 hours .
it &apos;s been almost 30 .
that &apos;s true , that &apos;s been his pattern , yes .
so where &apos;s phoebe ?
we &apos;re trying to figure it out .
have you checked with all the hospitals ?
yes , we have .
well , what about the churches ? she could be there .
we &apos;re covering the churches , too , i promise you .
so you just don &apos;t know a damn thing .
mrs. payton--
you should be out there right now .
even my husband is out there looking , putting up flyers .
how can you be looking for her from in here ?
i understand what you &apos;re going through .
you don &apos;t understand anything .
no , i actually do .
maybe we can find a place where we can talk .
agents , i &apos;d like to help ,
but i can &apos;t disclose the details of tara &apos;s therapy .
frankly , i &apos;m surprised
she gave me permission to talk to you .
dr. berneman , tara is the only victim
who &apos;s seen this man and survived .
there &apos;s two lives at stake here .
we &apos;re just trying to get some insight .
well , i can tell you this--
when tara first came to me ,
she was suffering from extreme ptsd .
for lack of a better clinical term ,
she was a hot mess .
she would scratch at the burn scars on her arm till they bled .
she had insomnia ,
and when she did sleep , she had nightmares .
for a time , she was even suicidal .
i noticed that she repeatedly snapped a hair tie around her wrist .
that &apos;s a form of aversion therapy .
when negative feelings about the event start to take over ,
she snaps the rubber band .
it helps her keep control .
call it a supplement to a pretty strict regimen
that helps her keep control .
but she &apos;s got a long way to go .
are you telling us that we shouldn &apos;t be trying to question her ?
i &apos;m telling you we worked very hard for two years .
tara &apos;s finally approaching normal .
she &apos;s got a job . she paints .
she even had a date last week .
i would hate to put her through anything
that might set her back .
all right , doctor , well , we appreciate
you taking time out of your vacation .
feel free to call if you need anything else .
thank you , doctor .
it looks like we may need to give tara her space .
yeah , well , it &apos;s too bad ,
because she &apos;s the only real lead we &apos;ve got .
i &apos;m at a dead end .
i spoke to the families of the previous victims
and they had nothing to add to their original statements .
why hasn &apos;t he returned phoebe payton yet ?
there has to be a reason .
i hate to state the obvious , but maybe he killed her .
but why take the time , effort , and risk
to return all the other kids just to kill this one ?
you know , she could have succumbed to an asthma attack .
or we &apos;re looking at this wrong .
what if he &apos;s finally found the kid
he &apos;s really been looking for ?
but we profiled him as a sexual sadist with rage issues .
the children have no value to him . it &apos;s the nannies he wants .
the first part of that still could be right .
clearly he &apos;s a sadist .
but what if the kids are more valuable to him than the nannies ?
then the nannies are collateral damage
in the hunt for what he really wants--a child .
and somehow phoebe payton fits the bill .
that explains why he abducted her earlier than expected .
well , why wouldn &apos;t he just grab the children , then ?
because he &apos;s attracted to the dynamic between nanny and child .
it could also be a forensic countermeasure .
if he only took the children , he would have left witnesses behind .
but what &apos;s so special about phoebe ?
what makes her different from the others ?
the asthma .
hallelujah , this place is dead .
give me a job , give me a job
garcia , i need you to check the health records of all 5 kids
that the unsub returned .
any special needs , any medications .
okey @-@ dokey artichokey .
everyone healthy as a horse .
that &apos;s super healthy . clean bill . nothing .
thanks , garcia .
really ? that &apos;s all ? but i have so many skills to help . please ?
hello ?
if his ultimate objective is the kid ,
then he may abandon his schedule altogether .
which means gina may not have until may 13 .
we need a targeted media strategy . i &apos;ll go get hotch .
we believe we &apos;re looking for a caucasian male
who &apos;s almost certainly a resident of los angeles county .
as you know , he operates on a strict yearly schedule ,
which takes patience and discipline .
which leads us to belive he &apos;s in his late 30s or 40s .
he abducts his victims from public parks in broad daylight ,
which tells us that he &apos;s socially competent ,
fits in , appears non @-@ threatening .
in other words , he &apos;s someone you &apos;d never notice .
do you think he &apos;ll abduct more victims anytime soon ?
it &apos;s possible , though we find it highly doubtful .
his schedule seems to be very important to him .
then why hasn &apos;t he returned the baby yet ?
we think he suffers from a rare psychological disorder
called paternal desire .
like its sister disorder , maternal desire ,
it stems from a deep @-@ seated need to fill an emotional void
left by the loss of a child .
we think that loss may be related
to some kind of long @-@ term stressor in his life .
and this explains why he exhibits so much rage and violence
against the nannies that he abducts .
he &apos;s shown little mercy toward his adult victims ,
but he &apos;s been compassionate to the children .
and it &apos;s that sense to which we &apos;d like to appeal .
at this point i &apos;d like to introduce shane and melody payton .
these are phoebe &apos;s parents and gina &apos;s employers .
mr. and mrs . payton .
please ... if you &apos;re watching this
or if you know the man who did this ,
please contact the authorities .
phoebe &apos;s just ...
she &apos;s just a baby .
and our nanny , gina , she is a good person .
she doesn &apos;t deserve this .
just do the right thing and let them go , please .
phoebe has severe asthma
and she needs this medication .
she can &apos;t breathe without it .
please let them go .
give our baby back !
yeah , this is derek morgan .
yes .
can you hold on ?
just a second .
go ahead .
really ?
that would be great .
ok . thank you .
that was tara rios .
what happened ?
she wants to help us .
you &apos;re kidding .
she saw the press conference .
jj , good work . it was your idea to go national .
i &apos;m gonna get them to turn us around .
i just wanted to let you know
that we &apos;ve convinced a witness to come forward .
she &apos;s a victim who had escaped .
i realize it &apos;s not the news you &apos;re hoping for ,
but even the smallest piece of information
could help us find phoebe and gina .
in the meantime , it would be a good idea
if you could go home and get some rest .
it would do you some good .
no , no , we &apos;re not going anywhere .
so , what makes you think that it &apos;s gonna work this time ?
well , we &apos;re gonna try something new .
it &apos;s a psychotherapy called emdr .
it stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing .
it &apos;s very effective with ptsd
and memories that have been buried especially deep .
what if i can &apos;t ? what if there &apos;s really nothing in there ?
there &apos;s evidence that suggests
we process intellectual material
in a different part of the brain than emotional material .
emdr helps link the two .
tara , we will be with you the whole time .
and you &apos;re gonna help us catch this guy .
i promise you .
how does this ... emdr thing , how does it work ?
first we &apos;ll start by putting you in a safe place , mentally ,
by asking you to focus on a particular image ,
a memory that makes you happy .
and then we &apos;ll start asking questions .
and then when you &apos;re ready ,
we &apos;ll have you follow a light that moves side to side .
so , can you tell us about jake ?
he was adorable .
big blue eyes .
he was such a good boy .
when was the last time you saw him ?
that day . the day that we got taken .
we went to the park , like we always did .
jake loved the park .
what &apos;s the first thing that comes to mind
when you think about that day ?
it was chilly .
i forgot my coat .
what can you tell us about the abduction itself ?
it all happened so quickly .
that &apos;s ok . take your time .
a man came up to us . i think--
i think he had a leash in his hand .
did he have a dog ?
yeah . yeah , he did .
that &apos;s good . you didn &apos;t remember that before .
do you know what kind of dog ?
no , but it was big . i didn &apos;t--
i didn &apos;t want it near jake .
he said ...
he said jake reminded him of his baby sister .
... my baby sister .
you said before he was a white guy .
can you see his face ?
no .
but he has a gun and he &apos;s--
he &apos;s pointing it at jake .
oh , god .
calm down .
just concentrate on the light .
what happened next ?
he hit me ...
in my face , then i fell .
jake was crying and ...
i couldn &apos;t help him .
i couldn &apos;t do anything .
i ... i think i passed out .
i ...
i ...
the burning ...
woke me up .
he was using cigarettes .
i was tied to a bed .
he kept saying , &quot; can you take it ? &quot;
and he said if i couldn &apos;t take it
that he was gonna do it to jake .
oh , my god .
ok . you &apos;re safe now .
tara .
jake , he won &apos;t stop crying .
help me . help me .
he says he needs help .
you actually heard the word &quot; help &quot; ?
yeah .
that can &apos;t be jake , tara .
he &apos;s too little to talk .
help me ! help me .
no , it was a woman .
a woman ?
what woman ?
i don &apos;t know .
help me , please !
i don &apos;t know ! i need to stop now .
i need to stop .
how &apos;re you doing ?
you need anything ?
how could that stuff ...
be hidden in my head all these years ?
i feel like i &apos;m going crazy .
you &apos;re not .
it &apos;s just your brain &apos;s way of protecting you .
that &apos;s them , isn &apos;t it ?
that little girl &apos;s parents ?
are they ok ?
not so much .
you have kids ?
yeah . yeah , a little boy , henry .
how old is he ?
he &apos;s 4 and a half .
oh , that &apos;s a great age .
who &apos;s--who &apos;s with him now ?
uh , well , uh , right now his dad is at work , so ...
he &apos;s with his nanny .
this is working .
but we &apos;ve gotta keep going .
the answers are in there . i know it .
but we &apos;re running out of time .
look , i made you a promise that
we would catch this guy .
please help me keep it .
ok , tara , i want you to focus
on the screams of that woman .
where were you when you heard them ?
help me ! help me , please !
help !
it was when he was burning me .
did you ever see her ?
no .
wait .
oh , my god , the van .
the van-- she was there , too .
can you describe her ?
there &apos;s blood in my eyes .
she was--she was wearing a blue shirt .
was that the only time that you saw her ?
i got out . i wanted to search for jake ,
but i couldn &apos;t hear him crying anymore .
i saw her .
i saw her in the bathroom ...
tied to a sink .
she had blond hair .
and i ...
roscoe , shut up !
i left them there .
i left them both there .
can you think of anything else about her ?
her name , maybe ?
can you take it , alison ?
alison .
her name was alison .
that &apos;s what he would call her when he was hurting her .
so if this mystery blonde in blue
was in the van with tara , that means the unsub
probably grabbed them on the same day .
he &apos;s never taken more than one woman at a time , though .
maybe she wasn &apos;t part of the plan .
jj and morgan are still working with tara .
she thinks she might be able to describe the unsub enough
to get a composite sketch .
what have you got , garcia ?
what i &apos;ve got is a promotion coming ,
&apos;cause , damn , i am good .
a very blond alison astor
was reported missing 3 years ago .
now , she &apos;s from dallas ,
but she never returned home from a business trip
she took to los angeles . she was single ,
she worked as a sales rep for
a pharmaceutical company , she was an avid runner .
she even qualified for the boston marathon , which is not easy .
all right , call the coroner &apos;s office and see if there are
any unidentified female remains for the last 3 years .
um , sir , you &apos;re talking to me .
that &apos;s already done .
it &apos;s l.a. , so there are 12 unidentified female bodies ,
but only one with blond hair , wearing a blue shirt ,
and the coroner is expecting you , and you &apos;re welcome .
sorry about the wait . she was way in the back
and her possessions were up in storage .
here &apos;s the report .
she was scheduled to be buried soon ,
but every day we i.d. one of our jane does .
you weren &apos;t able to determine exact cause of death .
inconclusive . she was too decomposed .
found in a shallow grave up in
a remote part of griffith park .
so she was out there at least a year before she was found .
critters must have got to her , too .
yeah . they went to town .
you can see bite marks on her tibia , fibula .
they &apos;re on her radius , too .
something weird on this leg .
these bite marks here-- too big for anything
out in griffith park .
i &apos;d say that &apos;s from a very large dog ,
one pushing 100 pounds or so .
let me help her .
the nebulizer is in my bag .
the steam won &apos;t work . she needs her medicine !
he puts the nannies on display ,
but he hides alison astor in a remote shallow grave .
before alison started in pharmaceuticals ,
she was a corpsman in the navy .
she probably witnessed tara &apos;s abduction and tried to intervene .
it makes sense . she was trained to help people .
he hid her body because tara escaped .
and the anniversary means too much to him
to have alison &apos;s body be the one to be discovered .
well , we got our composite sketch .
hey , guys .
check this out .
he grabbed his first victims from here .
he abducted gina and phoebe from here .
he buried alison astor up here .
and down here in hollywood is
where tara rios was found passed out .
we can give it another try ,
but she has no idea where she escaped from
or how long she was wandering .
i &apos;m actually more intrigued
by what lies between these 4 points . look .
dog parks .
there &apos;s two of them .
she did say he had a dog .
and there were bite marks on alison astor &apos;s leg .
dog owners tend to be very regimented .
they follow a strict schedule .
and being out with his dog would allow him
to inconspicuously stalk his prey .
those parks are extremely social .
someone out there had to see this guy .
let me help her !
shut up .
don &apos;t pretend that you care .
do whatever you want to me ,
but , please , she &apos;ll die .

shh . good girl .
give her back now .
what ?
she &apos;s mine ! give her to me .
no .
roscoe , up !
no !
i &apos;m not finished with you yet .
please don &apos;t hurt her !
morgan , you and jj canvass the north end of the park .
we will take the south .
we should make sure lapd covers playgrounds
and walking trails as well .
i suggest we go as far west as runyon canyon .
a lot of real estate .
it &apos;ll be nightfall soon .
if this guy is planning on keeping the kid ,
there &apos;s a good chance he won &apos;t even stick to his anniversary date .
the fbi has released a composite sketch
of the so @-@ called &quot; nanny killer , &quot;
who &apos;s suspected of abducting and brutally murdering 4 young women
up and down the california coast over the past 6 years .
his latest abductees ,
23 @-@ year @-@ old gina mendes
and 2 @-@ year @-@ old phoebe payton ,
both from los angeles , still are missing .
if you have any information regarding their whereabouts ,
please call the amber alert hotline
or the lapd immediately .
yeah , that kind of looks like jonny .
do you know him ?
yeah . i mean , not really , just from up here , but ...
hang on .
hey , baby , come here for a sec ?
he &apos;s up here more than i am .
what &apos;s up ?
these guys are with the fbi .
take a look at this . that look like jonny to you ?
kinda . yeah .
do you know where we can find him ?
no idea . i used to see him up here all the time .
haven &apos;t seen him in a few days , though .
what kind of dog does he have ?
a big old rottweiler .
roscoe . he plays with daisy .
do you know jonny &apos;s last name ?
no . just jonny .
sorry .
is he in some kind of trouble ?
oh , man of my favorite fantasies , what you got ?
i need you to do your thing , mama .
look up every jonny , john , and jonathan in los angeles
with a dog license .
ok , there are 420 .
does it specify what breed of dog ?
yes . unless they &apos;re mixed breed .
are there any rottweilers on that list ?
not a one .
oh , hang on .
not everybody bothers to get a license .
what about vet records ?
what about them ?
find all the veterinarian offices
within a 10 @-@ mile radius of griffith park .
this guy &apos;s got a rottweiler .
ok , there are 14 vet offices , there are a lot of records .
it &apos;s gonna take me a sec . hold up , i &apos;ll hit you back .
that was a good boy .
come here .
turn around .
good boy . go .
i got a hit . there &apos;s a jonathan ray covey
who owns a 110 @-@ pound rottweiler named roscoe .
i &apos;ve got a home and a work address .
well , who &apos;s closer to what ?
you &apos;re closer to home ,
which is right next to griffith park . you &apos;re right there .
go ! go ! i &apos;ll let hotch know .
i thought i told you to get to bed !
you &apos;re a bad boy .
you don &apos;t care about that baby . just admit it .
just say the word .
no .
save yourself .
admit it and i &apos;ll stop .
never .
you &apos;ll break .
they all do .
i got the skinny on this covey dude .
he &apos;s 40 years old , he lives in the same house he grew up in ,
which he inherited from his mother when she died 10 years ago .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s so connected to griffith park .
he probably grew up going there .
how did his mother die , garcia ?
heart attack . same thing with his dad back in &apos; 86 .
and here &apos;s something super sad . when covey was 7,
his 2 @-@ year @-@ old sister amanda was drowned .
how ?
bathtub . there was a nanny watching ,
a griselda vasquez .
there was a full investigation . the death was ruled accidental .
she was cleared of any wrongdoing .
covey must still blame her for his sister &apos;s death .
and guess what date she died .
may 13 .
winner winner , chicken dinner .
and here &apos;s another piece of interest .
baby sister had asthma .
so this isn &apos;t paternal desire ,
this is fraternal desire .
oh , and peep this . griselda vasquez ,
she lost her battle with breast cancer 6 years ago .
that &apos;s when he killed his first victim .
that must have been his trigger .
he never got his chance to take revenge .
just give in .
fbi !
jonathan ray covey ,
it &apos;s the fbi !
his sister &apos;s room .
roscoe , attack !
drop the weapon !
roscoe !
let her go !
drop the weapon !
jonathan , let her go .
she &apos;s not griselda !
griselda ?
that bitch lied and got away with it !
she didn &apos;t care about us . she just wanted to save her own ass !
but that girl right there is not your nanny .
don &apos;t hurt that dog !
jonathan , let her go !
he &apos;s gone out front !
stop !
stop right there !
we &apos;ve got it .
you all right ?
yeah .
that was a nice shot .
agent jareau ?

i asked them to bring me .

he &apos;s dead .
and we saved phoebe and gina , too .
