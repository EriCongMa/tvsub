good night .
bye .
but the least you could do is be honest with jenny .
that &apos;s what this is all about ?
yeah .
you always liked her .
you kept flirting with me
long after you started dating her .
yeah , well , that &apos;s gonna stop .
and while you &apos;re at it ,
no more running to me for favors or asking me for help .
how &apos; bout you find yourself some other paralegal ?
because , as far as i &apos;m concerned , we &apos;re done .
you haven &apos;t even gone to any law school .
i &apos;m working there !
oh , yeah .
what , as a lawyer ?
it &apos;s a long story , okay ?
but you can &apos;t tell anyone , ever .
this guy is not your friend . he is an anchor .
he is my oldest friend .
you were there . what would you do ?
i &apos;d tell him everything .
watch cameron go down .
sleep like a baby after i did it .
harvey would never use this ,
and he &apos;d kill me if he knew i had it .
but can you use this ... to help him ?
clifford danner . he was 18 .
i put him in jail 12 years ago .
he &apos;s innocent .
cameron buried the evidence .
you have enough to overturn ?
i don &apos;t know .
so what are you going to do ?
i &apos;m gonna get him out .
go , go .
9224 @-@ 4930 @-@ 754229 .
nope , that &apos;s not right .
right . i gave it to you backwards .
i have to keep it interesting for myself .
ah , security code .
you know i know it .
why are you wasting our time ?
&apos;cause i wanna make you work for it .
oh , really ?
well , maybe i don &apos;t feel like working for it .
okay . all right--
767 ! stop . no , no .
what are you doing ?
showering .
oh , you don &apos;t trust me being here without you .
no , i--
i trust you , i just ...
you know , i like everything just so .
just so doesn &apos;t mean clean .
it means just so .
gotcha .
have a good day .
bye .
trevor .
jesus .
surprise .
can i come in ?
no .
you , uh-- well , i &apos;m late .
so we should , you know , grab a coffee on the way .
well , let me just-- let me just take a piss first .
no , no . uh , trevor , stop !
stop .
you got a girl in there , don &apos;t you .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m just gonna take a pee .
trevor , stop . no , no--
it &apos;s fine .
that &apos;s not even funny .
get your hand off the knob . get your hand off the knob .
we &apos;re going . i &apos;ll buy you breakfast .
you &apos;re so serious .
he loves you !
go .
i got a job .
law firm mail room , of all places .
i was wondering , um ...
think i could stay with you for a couple days ?
i don &apos;t really know if that &apos;s such a good idea .
you know , i could have died that day ,
if it hadn &apos;t been for you and your boss .
and i don &apos;t want to live that life anymore .
i really don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t have anybody else .
okay .
i was thinking , you know ,
maybe i &apos;ll try and call jenny .
yeah . uh , you should .
what are you doing here , prosecutor ?
i believe you &apos;re innocent .
you just found out you only got six months to live ?
&apos;cause today ain &apos;t the day you get your conscience clear .
that &apos;s not the reason i &apos;m--
you know , i &apos;ve been in here a dozen years ...
while jason black and matt bailey are out there living it up .
you think i give a shit what you believe ?
you wanna hit me ?
i wanna kill you .
but i lay a finger on you ,
and they put me in the hole for 48 hours ,
extend my sentence .
i got four years left .
i ain &apos;t doing another minute than that .
good , &apos; cause i &apos;m here for your absolution .
i &apos;m here for your redemption .
this is the letter i told you jill wrote me .
i know .
the one you didn &apos;t believe existed .
i believe it now . you were involved with her .
this is the proof .
involved with her ?
i loved her .
and she loved me .
then why did you keep this relationship a secret ?
look at me , man .
they gave me a scholarship to that school .
but nobody wanted me dating anybody at that school .
i had a record .
if her father ever found out ,
i &apos;d have been done .
they wouldn &apos;t have cared .
like you didn &apos;t care .
where &apos;d this come from ?
it was buried , but it got found .
and this is why you believe i &apos;m innocent ?
yes .
and it &apos;s enough to get me out ?
no .
but that wasn &apos;t the only thing they buried .
jill &apos;s dress had your dna on it .
but there &apos;s another piece of clothing that had blood on it .
a camisole , and they buried that
because that dna wasn &apos;t hers and it wasn &apos;t yours .
let me guess .
it was jason black &apos;s .
unfortunately , i don &apos;t have access to his dna .
so you finally gonna go after him and matt bailey ?
i &apos;m not a prosecutor anymore .
then what the hell are you here for ?
i want you to let me represent you .
you think i &apos;m gonna trust you after what you did to me ?
i don &apos;t see anyone else lining up to get your ass out of here .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s an article where clifford danner took his plea .
do you want me to read it to you ?
no .
&quot; clifford danner had a history of violence .
this poor girl was brutally murdered
at a high @-@ end , private school and , quote ,
&apos;this doesn &apos;t sound like the work
of the squash team captain to me . &apos; &quot;
i don &apos;t know , harvey ,
this article makes a pretty compelling case that he &apos;s guilty .
well , he &apos;s not .
it &apos;s quoting you .
i was wrong .
jessica , i don &apos;t think you should let harvey take this case .
louis , we &apos;re talking about a man &apos;s life .
and if harvey thinks the kid didn &apos;t do it ,
then so do i.
i understand that ,
but what harvey thinks and what harvey can prove
are two different things .
in my experience with harvey ,
it &apos;s one and the same .
listen to me-- he was set up .
jill hodgkins went to him and said
that she was gonna turn in these two other guys for selling coke .
they killed her and planted the coke in clifford &apos;s room .
i didn &apos;t buy his story because his dna was on her .
he claimed that it was because they were
having this secret relationship .
but he had no proof .
and now he does .
okay , i hate to disagree with you here ,
but i took a little poll of the partners--
whoa . you did what ?
well , i was discreet , i assure you .
and they feel , as i do ,
that harvey &apos;s actions will hurt this firm .
this firm ?
you mean my firm .
and when you &apos;re running the firm of litt , nothing , and nobody ,
then you can make whatever call you &apos;d like .
until then ,
you can just get back to work .
i &apos;m telling you , those guys did it .
and as far as his violent history is concerned ,
you of all people are gonna tell me
that a person can &apos;t change if they get a second chance ?
what do you need me to do ?
i need your help .
i thought i made it clear that i don &apos;t expect
to hear those words from your mouth ever again .
it &apos;s important .
it &apos;s always important .
it &apos;s for harvey .
it &apos;s always for harvey .
he specifically asked for you .
by name ?
he said he wanted the best .
well , if he didn &apos;t specifically name me ,
and you didn &apos;t specifically tell him ,
then i am going to specifically decline .
rachel .
are you kidding me ?
okay .
i know that you &apos;re mad at me .
but we &apos;re talking about a guy roughly our age
who spent over a decade in prison for a murder
that he didn &apos;t commit , and we are trying to get him out .
i think that &apos;s more important than our little ...
whatever .
whatever ?
you know what i mean .
problems with two people . hill of beans .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
casablanca .
oh , i &apos;ve never seen that movie .
you--
no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s old .
old ?
oh , my god .
okay , what &apos;s your basis for getting him out ?
prosecutorial misconduct ?
buried evidence .
okay , then you need precedence to overturn .
i already got those .
then what ?
i need to find out everything
i can about the former d.a. &apos; s cases .
okay .
gone with the wind ?
no .
citizen kane ?
no .
dirty dancing ?
nobody puts baby in the corner .
i can &apos;t believe you .
i &apos;m helping you .
come on . let &apos;s go .
you thought to do this on your own ?
i decided to think like you .
this is a high @-@ profile murder case
against the new district attorney himself .
you know that , right ?
i know .
and you think i &apos;m gonna let you come with me for this , don &apos;t you ?
i know you are .
you know , i don &apos;t want you thinking like me any more .
now you know how the rest of us feel .
aha , right there .
i always would have said that .
you wouldn &apos;t .
yes , i would .
harvey specter .
terrance wolf . that &apos;s your case ?
i thought it best to cut a deal ,
let him out for time served .
hm , high @-@ profile murder at a prep school .
no , i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll be cutting any deals .
miguel ruiz , lawrence baker ,
ray jenkins , calvin reynolds .
and who are these gentlemen ?
they &apos;re other cases with improprieties
that we &apos;ll be forced to cite if we have to file to reopen .
you , of all people , don &apos;t want that .
really ? why not ?
because it &apos;ll make you look bad .
didn &apos;t happen on my watch .
you &apos;re supposed to be cleaning up the office .
i find sunshine is the best disinfectant .
your mother teach you that ?
no , harvey , life taught me that .
this man &apos;s innocent .
then he should have gone to trial .
evidence was buried .
then dig it up .
and make your case .
mike ... give me a minute .
terrance , you &apos;re forcing me to do something
that i &apos;d rather not do .
and what is that ?
take this case on .
i win .
it &apos;s what i do .
it &apos;ll send a message around your entire office
that you can &apos;t handle your business .
well , if i lose , i lose .
that &apos;s the way the law works .
but , harvey , don &apos;t think i can &apos;t send a message or two myself .
rumor has it you &apos;re the traitor who sold out his former boss .
it wasn &apos;t me .
those rumors are wrong .
so mysterious evidence from back in the day
on your old boss just appeared ?
you didn &apos;t know .
maybe it wasn &apos;t you .
but it had to be somebody , right , harvey ?
have a nice day .
my office--now .
i have never thought about firing you .
you took something when we quit the d.a. &apos; s office ?
come clean right now , or i &apos;ll let you go
and not give it a minute &apos;s thought .
i knew it .
you were in trouble .
you had no right .
i don &apos;t care .
what &apos;d you do with it ?
she did what she had to do .
she gave it to me .
and the two of you saw fit to fight my battles for me ?
we did what you would have done
for either one of us .
so get off your high horse .
leave the woman alone .
we work because i &apos;ve always known that i can trust you .
don &apos;t ever go behind my back again .
you &apos;re welcome .
wait , he called you ?
yeah . he left a message .
what did he say ?
that ...
he wanted to see me .
and what did you do ?
texted him and i told him i wasn &apos;t interested .
we gotta tell him .
no , we don &apos;t .
yeah , we do .
i &apos;m already living a lie at work .
i @-@ i can &apos;t live one at home too .
do you think that if you told trevor about us
he &apos;s gonna keep your secret to himself ?
i know trevor .
if i tell him , he will take it up with me .
if he hears it from someone else--
who &apos;s gonna tell him ?
i don &apos;t know !
okay ? i just-- i know that he &apos;s over there right now ,
and it &apos;s drilling a hole in my brain .
then stay here .
i can &apos;t .
why not ?
because he came to me for help .
okay .
okay what ?
tell him .
but please wait until he has his life back together .
what do you mean ?
he came to you for help .
how much help do you think hearing about us
is gonna be for him ?
okay .
okay what ?
okay , i &apos;ll stay .
could you just not touch anything ?
because , uh ...
i like my place just so .
what ? this place is a mess .
what are you ...
the court finds sufficient misconduct to warrant a new trial .
any pretrial motions at this time ?
yes , your honor .
the state advises that we will be seeking
the maximum sentence of life in prison .
what ?
your honor , my client has four years left .
mr. specter , the state has every right to seek that penalty .
would you like to confer with your client
before i vacate his conviction ?
you could just withdraw your motion right now .
i &apos;ll confer with my client , your honor .
get the message ?
four more years .
or you get out now .
or stay in the rest of my life .
september 19 , 2007 .
what ?
his halfway point .
day i realized i could make it .
you never said this could happen .
he &apos;s sending a message .
it &apos;s got nothing to do with you .
it &apos;s got everything to do with me .
what do you wanna do ?
what do you think ?
if we win , i want in .
if we lose , i don &apos;t .
we &apos;ll win .
how do you know ?
because i know .
same way you knew i was guilty ?
what do you think ?
i think harvey wins his cases .
what would you do ?
i &apos;d trust him .
harvey , can you give us a minute ?
clifford ...
i don &apos;t know you , and you don &apos;t know me .
but i &apos;m gonna tell you a story
about what that man did for me .
and why i think you should trust him .
the court is now in session .
mr. specter ...
gonna withdraw your motion ?
your honor , my client wishes to proceed to trial .
gensync chemical .
you dropped this today .
louis &apos;s client ?
louis &apos;s fortune 500 client . you wanna guess why ?
his ears ? they freak a lot of people out .
that was one client .
his teeth ? fidgeting ?
could be anything .
all right , stop it .
let me guess : one of the board members
has a kid who went to his school .
a daughter .
and louis &apos;s correctly pointed out
that they might not be the only clients
that will punish us for taking this case .
which costs us money . - mm @-@ hmm .
louis is in the majority this time .
which hurts your position with the partners .
you telling me to drop this ?
i &apos;m telling you to win .
but that &apos;s not why i called you in here .
have a seat .
donna .
you need to get over it .
i &apos;m trying . it &apos;s not that easy .
yes , it is .
tell me .
okay .
think about what your life would be like without her .
now i know .
know what ?
how you always forgive me .
oh , it &apos;s nowhere near as easy to forgive you .
thank about it .
oh , i do .
every goddamn day .
hey .
hey .
we &apos;re starting trial today .
i know , you &apos;ve got five minutes .
never start a trial without doing our thing .
yeah , well , you don &apos;t have time .
there &apos;s plenty of time .
you don &apos;t have time .
i &apos;m sorry .
for what ?
don &apos;t push it .
okay , let &apos;s go . you got three minutes .
okay , here or in my office ?
here &apos;s good .
okay , on three .
one , two--
wait , let &apos;s go in your office .
i &apos;ll get the can opener .
yeah .
you left that in the kitchen .
thanks . i hate it when i do that .
you don &apos;t have any numbers in your speed dial .
i don &apos;t need &apos; em .
and yet you forgot your phone .
it &apos;s not the same thing .
okay .
hey , rachel ...
thank you for before .
sure .
i mean ...
it was for harvey .
yes .
today &apos;s your first trial .
what ? i &apos;ve been to trial before .
yeah , but not when you &apos;ve been with me .
fair enough .
okay , i wanna start a ritual with you .
what do you wanna do ?
we &apos;re on the ...
phone .
remember that gymnastics video
we saw ?
yeah , i can &apos;t get behind that .
feeling good ?
never better .
you ?
i &apos;m ready to roll .
don &apos;t think i didn &apos;t see that can opener .
what do you think you &apos;re doing by opening this case ?
i &apos;m making sure an innocent man
doesn &apos;t suffer for the crimes of others .
and what about jill ?
don &apos;t you care how she suffered ?
you two would know more about that than anyone , right ?
excuse me .
i bought the devastated friend act
12 years ago .
but i know better now .
mike , meet jason black and matt bailey .
just don &apos;t shake their hands .
they &apos;ve got jill hodgkins &apos; blood all over them .
look , i don &apos;t know what you think you know .
but when i &apos;m done testifying , the jury &apos;s gonna know
that clifford killed jill .
just &apos; cause you switched sides ,
doesn &apos;t mean the rest of the world did .
we just lost the letter .
the what ?
i didn &apos;t realize he &apos;d have the nerve to lie on the stand .
it &apos;s not exactly a giant leap from killing someone .
perjury and murder , they aren &apos;t the same thing .
yeah , murder &apos;s worse .
it &apos;s easier . nobody &apos;s watching .
let &apos;s go .
mr. black , what exactly did jill tell you
regarding the defendant ?
she told me she felt trapped .
i thought she was talking about school ,
but now i know what she meant .
that letter was dated a week before she was killed .
she must have broken up with him ,
and this is how he paid her back .
mr. black , you said you didn &apos;t see jill hodgkins
at all on the day of the murder .
is that correct ?
correct .
so there &apos;d be no reason for your blood
to be on any of her clothing at all .
no , there &apos;d be no reason .
would you be willing to have a dna test , mr. black ?
objection , your honor . prejudicial .
we &apos;ll pay for it , if that &apos;s a problem .
mr. specter .
it &apos;s about the dna , and they can &apos;t spin that .
detective packel ,
the dress wasn &apos;t the only article of clothing
that you submitted , was it ?
no , there was a camisole .
was it in your report ?
yeah , if you bothered to read it .
i did read it , detective .
and what was the dna analysis on that camisole ?
i never picked it up .
why is that ?
well , it wasn &apos;t ready till two days later
and we already had enough from the dress .
enough ?
a man &apos;s life is at stake .
enough for what ?
enough for you to put him away
without bringing it up for 12 years .
well , i did pick up that test ,
along with the camisole .
your honor , i &apos;d like to request a side bar .
on what grounds ?
the camisole and any evidence connected to it
are inadmissible .
this is bullshit .
easy . what ?
your honor , in between
picking up the camisole at the precinct
and dropping it off at the lab ,
you can see here the document is flawed .
therefore , the chain of possession with respect to the camisole was broken .
you gotta be kidding me .
it &apos;s inadmissible .
first six .
what ?
first six months are the hardest .
in your mind .
i don &apos;t know if i can do that again .
mr. specter ,
you are accusing a police officer of tampering with evidence .
yes , i am .
when the results of the dna test came back , they didn &apos;t line up ,
and detective packel changed the custody documents .
even if mr. specter &apos;s assertions were true ,
it would automatically taint the evidence anyway .
he &apos;s got a point .
that camisole was what allowed us
to reopen this case in the first place .
the camisole was proof that evidence was buried .
that &apos;s why the case was reopened .
an entirely separate issue from whether that evidence
can be used in this trial .
clifford ...
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on in there ,
but no matter what they rule ,
he &apos;s not gonna lose this one .
you sure ?
i am .
your honor ...
that &apos;s enough .
i &apos;m instructing the jury to disregard
all testimony relating to either the camisole
or the resulting dna test .
oh , my goodness . i &apos;m so sorry . are you okay ?
get out of my face .
what the hell are you doing , reopening this ?
you worried about getting caught intentionally tainting evidence ?
i didn &apos;t taint anything .
what i did was help you put away a guilty man
for brutally killing a young girl .
i &apos;m not gonna let you drag my reputation through the gutter .
not without consequences .
are you threatening me ?
&apos;cause the truth is , you wouldn &apos;t even be here
if you hadn &apos;t done something wrong .
me ? yeah .
that &apos;s all well and good for you to drag up shit from the past , huh ?
you &apos;re protected by you shiny suit , right ?
what are you talking about ?
lawyers never go after their own .
what is that denzel movie ?
&quot; tell it to me like i &apos;m a five @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
sometimes , the good guys gotta do bad things
to make the bad guys pay .
it &apos;s time to start painting outside the lines .
how ?
if mohammed won &apos;t come to the mountain ,
we need to bring the mountain to mohammed .
really ? the mountain to mohammed .
it &apos;s a thing .
yeah , i know .
it just has no meaning to me in this situation .
you said you could think like me . figure it out .
okay , yeah . i got it .
what is it ?
you tell me--i &apos;ll confirm .
nice try .
damn it !
why &apos;d you text me , matty ?
we got nothin &apos; to talk about .
i didn &apos;t text you . you texted me .
we gotta go .
come on , does it really matter who texted who ?
why not take advantage of the fact you get to see each other ?
catch up .
talk about old times .
yeah , like that time that you murdered that girl
and framed an innocent man .
we didn &apos;t do anything .
you &apos;re wasting your time .
am i ?
we know the truth .
it &apos;s just a matter of time until one of you turns on the other one .
question is , who &apos;s it gonna be ?
we were there today .
you &apos;re the ones running out of time .
asshole .
looks like the rattlesnakes are starting to commit suicide .
holy shit , that &apos;s from mississippi burning .
this whole idea is from mississippi burning .
you know that movie ?
i was trying to stump you with that one .
front to back . give me a break .
problem is , those two don &apos;t seem like they &apos;re gonna break .
they know we don &apos;t have anything .
only now we do .
so by the mountain to mohammed , you meant ...
dna , comin &apos; to mr. wolf .
that &apos;s good .
hi , donna .
hi , louis .
you &apos;re never ...
i know .
why ?
i need a favor .
you mean harvey needs a favor .
oh , that &apos;s very astute of you .
a big one .
you know your cousin in the dna lab ?
we need something today .
no .
it &apos;s for--
i know what it &apos;s for .
what do you want ?
i don &apos;t want anything .
i will fill in for norma .
okay ...
i &apos;m not being vindictive--
i &apos;m sorry , do i have the right office ?
listen to me . i want you , god damn it .
and i will throw that secretary right out the window
if any of you were gonna be my secretary ,
but i have a reputation that i value .
and i &apos;m not gonna be putting my reputation on the line
for something that i do not believe in ...
american ballet theater .
no .
followed by a one @-@ on @-@ one dinner with ...
baryshnikov .
oh , mommy .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
no . no .
nope , i &apos;m sorry .
okay .
can &apos;t do it .
got it .
okay ?
do you understand why ?
it &apos;s very clear to me .
no , no , because do you understand why--
i hear you , louis .
louis--
i want to , but i can &apos;t .
what ?
let go .
what ?
let go .
jessica would like to see you in her office .
oh , that phony bitch .
call your cousin .
it is not that simple .
yes , it is .
you &apos;ve compromised your principles before .
do it now .
like i told donna ,
this isn &apos;t for me .
this is for harvey .
wrong !
it &apos;s for me .
okay , you know , you want this so bad ,
why don &apos;t you maybe compromise your principles a little bit ?
excuse me ?
yeah . you know my billables .
you talk about it all the time . &quot; louis has got big billables . &quot;
you see my loyalty .
yet you refuse to acknowledge my value .
where &apos;s this going ?
where is this going ?
when you said
&quot; litt , nothing , and nobody , &quot;
you know what that said to me ?
that said ,
&quot; louis , you &apos;re never gonna make senior partner . &quot;
well , harvey &apos;s running out of time .
this is my leverage .
i want to make senior partner ,
and i want to make senior partner now .
louis ...
i do not respond to threats . i make them .
so if you ever want to be senior partner ,
you call your cousin .
now .
all right .
i don &apos;t need to see the results .
i saw their faces . they did it .
what happened to the letter ?
they ...
they made it seem like it didn &apos;t matter .
like , uh , he was jealous ,
and so he killed her .
wow , that ...
what ?
i &apos;m just wondering ...
what would have happened
if they hadn &apos;t kept their relationship a secret ?
i have to make a phone call .
okay .
jenny , hey . it &apos;s me .
i can &apos;t keep this a secret from trevor anymore .
i need to tell him .
call me .
dna results .
jason black and matt bailey ,
they match the samples of the dna taken from that camisole .
they did it .
where &apos;d you get that ?
i found it .
well , it doesn &apos;t prove anything .
it &apos;s their blood on it .
so what ?
they could have had a gym class together ,
played flag football , or any one of 100 other reasons .
jason black said he didn &apos;t see her that day .
it &apos;s two specks of blood from what could easily be any other day .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
me ?
you come in here with some unauthorized dna test and--
and right away , you expect me to just release
a convicted felon into the stree--
he didn &apos;t do it !
and how can you allow him to sit in there
while these two other murderers go free ?
let me explain something to you .
my job &apos;s to prosecute . your job is to defend .
i didn &apos;t bury any evidence .
i didn &apos;t toss that dna .
the judge did that based on fact .
you &apos;re coming after me for the sins of someone else .
this piece of paper here means nothing .
so unless one of those two boys
just up and volunteered that they killed that girl ,
your client &apos;s gonna go back to prison
for the rest of his life .
terrance , you have a reputation as a fair man .
i don &apos;t give a damn what other people think of me .
i care about what i think of me .
didn &apos;t work .

what &apos;s next is we have to put on a defense tomorrow .
we got nothing .
so what are we gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
ooh , rachel .

you have access to the partners &apos; kitchen .
yeah , i like to keep my finger on the pulse .
plus , they don &apos;t have cheetos .

or you are upset about something .

i let you rot .
i didn &apos;t give it a minute &apos;s thought for over a decade .

i deserve it . it &apos;s my fault .
you said it yourself .

i &apos;m gonna beat the shit out of one of those guys
and get him to rat on the other one .
which one ?
the weaker one .
which one is that ?
the one who didn &apos;t testify .
you &apos;re serious .
you can &apos;t do that .
who &apos;s gonna stop me ?
harvey , it wouldn &apos;t be admissible .
you &apos;ll never get them that way .
it &apos;ll get clifford out .
how ?
wolf won &apos;t be able to deny that he &apos;s innocent anymore .
harvey , you don &apos;t do this .
you can &apos;t beat people . that &apos;s not what you do .
it is today .
harvey , stop !
listen , i got another idea .

it &apos;s not who i am . it &apos;s who i represent .
jason black .
he knows you talked to the police .
no , i didn &apos;t , i swear .
that &apos;s not my department .
now , matt ...
you &apos;re gonna retract what you said .
you &apos;re gonna leave town .
and you &apos;re never gonna talk to them again .
or next time ....
that &apos;s gonna be your head .
somebody call the police ?
you .
you , what are you-- what are you doing here ?
hey , matt ... relax .
the detective was across the street the whole time .
we knew jason would send somebody .
what ?
who do you think told jason
you went to the police in the first place ?
i did ... harvey showed me the results of the dna test .
two splotches .
jason black &apos;s and yours .
okay , um ...
uh , i want to file a report .
sure .
i &apos;ll take you downtown .
you can look through the books .
maybe you find something .
maybe you don &apos;t .
but your real problem isn &apos;t that guy .
it &apos;s jason black .
somebody was gonna turn him in once before .
and i think you know the lengths he &apos;ll go to ...
to shut somebody up .
no , i don &apos;t . no , i don &apos;t .
we were here this time . we won &apos;t be here next time .
next time ?
what would have happened if he would have killed me this time ?
well , you &apos;d be dead , and we &apos;d have caught the guy
and used him to put jason away for murder .
shit , we should have done that .
yeah .
harvey , behave .
what do you want ? what do you want from me ?
what do you want from me ? !
confess to the crime .
turn in jason black .
no , i can &apos;t do that .
yes , you can . i &apos;ll tell you why .
you were 16 .
a juvenile .
that &apos;s three years maximum .
less , if you &apos;re the one who comes forward .
we &apos;ll get you a deal .
no , you can &apos;t make that promise .
you &apos;re not the d.a.
you &apos;d rather negotiate with jason ?
because he &apos;ll kill you ,
and you know it .
it was his idea . i didn &apos;t wanna do it .
i didn &apos;t wanna do it .
okay . get dressed and come with me .

hey , by the way , where &apos;d you get that bruise ?
sometimes the good guys got to do bad things ...
to make the bad guys pay .
that &apos;s right .
what ?
what ? should have let me do the talking .
wouldn &apos;t work . you &apos;re not ready yet .
not ready ? this whole thing was my idea .
you lost in housing court .

i don &apos;t know . what difference does that make ?
i know you did it .
you know ?
the same way you knew clifford was guilty ?
no , you don &apos;t get to tell me it &apos;s one way in court
and another out here .
you can &apos;t prove it ...
you don &apos;t know anything .
well , you broke the law .
tell yourself whatever you want .
i &apos;ll tell myself i got an innocent man out
and i put two guilty ones in .
the i &apos;ll close my eyes and i &apos;ll sleep like a baby .
one other thing .
you got a little something right over here .
i like you .
by the way , how did you make those guys
think that they were texting each other ?
i bought a prepaid phone .
set it to &quot; private . &quot;
i texted each one it was the other .
who else would it be ?
you .
yeah , but they &apos;re not gonna think that .
that &apos;s cool . you &apos;d make a good criminal .
yeah , better than you .
uh , excuse me , i was an amazing criminal .
you don &apos;t remember-- briefcase popping open ,
drugs spilling everywhere .
okay , that was a mechanical failure ,
and that could have happened to anybody .
weed was all over the floor .
oh , shit , i forgot my phone again .

how do you have this memory ?
you keep forgetting your phone .
