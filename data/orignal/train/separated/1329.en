We are live with a big story just breaking.
Not long ago, an undercover operation turned into a bloodbath,
when Boston Homicide detectives opened fire in the warehouse behind me.
Now, details are still emerging, but we can confirm now --
One dead, two wounded in the shooting.
I shot my best friend's father.
You had no choice.
Yeah, tell that to maura.
Jane, you shot a man who is head of the Irish mob,
20 years on the run, suspected of 15 murders.
Well, he was nice to her, though.
Biology doesn't make him her father
Or mean you stop doing your job.
My god, I didn't think this was the way
we'd take down Paddy Doyle.
You shouldn't have come here by yourself.
Why not?
Kevin, don't! Don't!
No!
Maura!
Maura.
Don't touch him!
Maura -- - No, I mean it!
Don't you dare touch him.
Oh, god. She hates me.
She's just in shock, jane.
Take your jacket!
Maura, come on.
I Had to.
Paddy showed up, and he shot our suspect.
No, he shot the guy who tried to run me over
with his car yesterday -- put my mother in the hospital.
Look, we had a handle on it
until Paddy crashed our operation.
Oh, you mean your boyfriend had a handle on it?
Thanks for letting me know that agent Dean was planning to join us.
I didn't know he was gonna follow us in there!
What'd you expect him to do?
He's a federal agent! Paddy shot him!
In the leg!
If Paddy wanted dean dead, he'd be dead!
What are you saying?
You don't think your father was there to take us all out?
Shoot me, too?
He was only there to protect me.
If that's what you think, you are naive...
or ignorant... or I don't know what.
Well, at least I don't play judge and jury
and kill people.
You guys will make up.
Yeah. Yeah, that's what they said about the Beatles.
We should have never let her do this.
Never.
This is my first undercover assignment.
Wait.
I'm doin' a U.C.
I feel like Donnie Brasco.
Well, you don't look like him.
Can you keep it down, please?
All right, we're gonna tuck this wire right here.
The microphone doesn't make me
look like I have three breasts, does it?
Well, some guys are into that.
Is this what you'd wear to an undercover operation?
I feel a little dressy.
I'd wear a flak jacket.
Oh, you know, I know this sounds vain,
But I couldn't be a cop.
You, vain?
Well, even you look a little chunky in a flak jacket.
Wow, really? Okay.
Well, thank you very much,
And you know what?
I think your little medical examiner get-ups
make you look like a trash collector.
You do? So do I!
I always feel a little dumpy.
Put your jacket on.
Okay.
You want to know what's truly odd about you?
Ah, I'm not sure.
You are the dumbest genius I know.
"I'm not sure" means "Pause."
It means do not blurt your subconscious thoughts.
Oh, right. Sorry.
Is this displaced aggression because I get to go undercover,
and you have to be my backup?
Yes.
We should get in there.
Okay. Let's go.
Listen to me. All right? This is serious.
Yep.
Somebody is trying to kill you
to stop you from investigating a murder.
You don't have to tell me that.
I was there when he nearly drove over my mother.
You know we're only letting you do this
because we're hoping that whoever this guy is,
he is desperate enough to follow you
into that warehouse and try again, all right?
But we're gonna be there this time.
I'm ready.
Wait -- what do you guys say to each other
right before you pull the string?
It's called a sting, maura.
Sting.
We say, "Don't get made."
I like that. "Don't get made."
Don't look so worried. What could go wrong?
Rizzoli.
I need to know what the hell just happened.
I got a dead suspect and an FBI agent with a bullet in his leg.
Agent Dean's gonna be fine. It was a through and through.
And I got one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives
dropping into the middle of my peoples' undercover operation?
Is Paddy gonna die?
It doesn't look good.
You should have told me you knew Paddy Doyle was in town.
Yeah, I know. I know.
Give me your gun.
What?
It's evidence now.
Now get your ass back to headquarters.
Captain Connors is gonna need to interview you.
Since when does the head of Internal Affairs do interviews?
Since now.
Hey, Ralph.
Hey, officer Wisniewski.
Feeling lucky today.
A 20-year search for mobster
Paddy Doyle ended today.
One for the good guys, huh?
Yeah, but someone worse could take over.
At least Paddy Doyle was from Southie,
played by some rules.
...is in fact the father of Dr. Maura Isles.
Can you believe that's his daughter?
You think that's good? Get this.
Cop who shot him and the M.E. are best friends.
You can't make this stuff up.
How long have you known
that your friend is Paddy Doyle's daughter?
Well, what does that have to do with the shootings?
Answer the question.
Two years.
Were you aware that Paddy Doyle would be there?
No.
Why was Agent Dean there?
I don't know.
What's your relationship with Agent Dean?
We're colleagues.
Do you have sexual relations with all your colleagues?
Excuse me?
Crap. Did you know this, Vince?
...has nothing to do with the fact that Doyle shot Agent Dean
and then he pointed his gun at me.
No. But it does tell us a lot about your judgment, detective.
We're in trouble.
Dr. Isles, two of the city's
best spine surgeons are evacuating the hematoma.
We should know more after that.
So no movement in his legs?
Does he have anyone... any family?
We'll need to know whether to resuscitate.
Me.
I recently learned that he's my biological father.
This is Sergeant Detective Cummings.
He'll be working with me on this.
Detective, did you put a BOLO out for Paddy Doyle?
No, sir. I did not.
You doing favors for Doyle
because Dr. Isles is your best friend?
What? No.
But you knew Doyle sometimes
slipped into town to see his daughter?
Well, apparently, so did you.
Oh, my god. A cop's been shot.
All right, let's go.
Gentlemen, we got to take a break.
We got a homicide. Jane, let's go.
Hey, she's not going anywhere.
It's a cop.
That's a hell of a way to get out of an interview.
Did you hear who it was?
No. How you holding up?
You saw -- we're not looking good.
We'll get through it.
No. No, we won't.
Especially when he goes to interview the woman
who cannot tell a lie.
You got to call Dr. Isles,
tell her how to play this.
I need you to back off, John.
I need them focused on this cop killing.
My people are clean.
Yeah? You want to bet your career on that, Sean?
She's not picking up. She knows it's me.
You don't know that.
Look at you, Agent Dean. Already up and around.
You betrayed me.
All right, Jane, listen to me.
Why would you tell Internal Affairs
that we had an intimate sexual relationship?
How do you describe relationships
with men who spend the night in your bed?
Uh, I-I'll pull the car around.
What were you doing there? Were you following me?
I was following Maura.
Thinking it would lead to Doyle.
That's why you came back, isn't it?
You figure you show up with some greeting-card cliches,
then you follow my best friend around.
Nobody's gonna ask any questions.
No, Jane, it was not like that.
Yeah. It was like that.
You thought you'd be the hero.
You don't look too heroic, Agent Dean.
Don't just walk away.
You know, we just lost a cop. I got a case to work.
Why didn't you tell me you'd found your biological father?
Would you have taken me if you...
you'd known I was Paddy Doyle's daughter?
Maura, darling, you'my daughter.
Your father and I raised you.
You're ours, not his.
Can I come in?
Oh, Angela.
How sweet of you to come.
Thank you.
Double homicide.
Ralph Ruffy and officer Walter Wis--
Wally Wisniewski?
He transferred to evidence management
to get off the street.
What the hell happened?
Looks like a robbery.
Well, what'd they get?
The register's not even open.
Frost, you check the security video?
Just about to.
The body is that of a well-nourished white male,
approximately late 50s.
What is Pike doing here?
You mean other than annoying the crap out of people?
We're stuck with him till Dr. Isles gets back.
Dr. Pike, how nice to have your expertise on this.
Double homicide. Almost
certainly a .38-caliber.
Pretty big hole.
Uh, maybe I'll just take a look.
Cause of death is quite clear.
Perhaps Dr. Isles needed your "expert" medical opinion
because she doubted her own.
I do not.
Yes... We were all frustrated with her wishy-washy approach.
I love a man who knows what he thinks.
May I?
You may, detective.
A faint mustache and beard are evident.
The lips are without injury.
He was shot in the back. That's not a classic robbery.
Might want to have a look at this.
So, he panics before he gets the cash.
Frankie, any other robberies reported in the area?
Nope.
Like you said, doesn't feel like a classic robbery.
You think the gunman knew Wally was a cop?
The way I reacted just made Jane's head off.
Adrenaline impairs cognitive sequencing, but still....
You were afraid for your life.
No, Paddy wouldn't have shot me.
We can't help who we love.
I don't love Paddy Doyle.
He's done terrible things.
It's just when Jane pulled that trigger,
you know, I never really see how they end up
on my autopsy table.
And he kept trying to tell me something.
"Hope" -- he kept saying "Hope."
I wonder if that was her name.
You mean your biological mother's name?
Dr. Isles, I'm sorry to have to ask you this,
but you didn't fill out the DNR.
"Do not resuscitate."
I have no idea what he would have wanted.
I don't --
Well, just think about it for a minute.
Oh, Maura. Maura.
Please don't.
My mother's very reserved. I'm not very good at it, either.
Jane always used to squirm off my lap.
You two have that in common.
You should go home. I'll be fine.
No, I-I'm gonna stay here.
No, I'm used to being alone.
Please. I'll be okay.
Cavanaugh says Connors just left headquarters.
Get to the hospital before he does.
We have a double homicide to solve.
If we don't get out in front of this,
we're not gonna be investigating any homicides.
You said it was a good shooting.
And now it's a witch hunt.
I.A.D. thinks we're dirty cops.
But we're not.
We bent a few rules, Jane.
To outsiders, we look dirty.
Go. Now.
Maura!
Don't say anything. Just listen.
Jane, I'm sorry, too.
We don't have much time.
The head of internal affairs is on his way up here
to get a statement from you about the shootings.
That's it?
That's it? That's all you have to say?
Not "I'm sorry that your father is dying"?
Oh, he's your father now?
What, am I sorry that a man who's wanted for 15 murders
didn't shoot me or Frost? No. I'm not.
Then why are you here?
To warn you.
Maura, if our friendship ever meant anything to you,
will you please think before you answer the questions
you're about to be.
Detective Rizzoli!
...asked.
They're doing an investigation.
They're building a case. They think we're dirty.
Your contempt for the rules borders on criminal.
You are talking to a witness!
She was just asking about my father.
You were ordered not to talk to each other
until our investigation is concluded.
I know this isn't a good time,
but I do have some questions.
And you immediately informed detective Rizzoli
that Paddy Doyle had resurfaced.
Yes, but --
Did detective Rizzoli act on this information?
She -- - Excuse me.
He's coming out of sedation. You can see him now.
Thank you.
Look, I know this is uncomfortable for you,
and I'm sorry for that.
But this man is an organized-crime figure.
Well, he's not going anywhere right now.
Do you want to help your friend?
What do you mean?
We know that Paddy kept a book. Did he ever mention it?
A book? No.
You understand this book is critical.
I saw "The godfather."
I'm guessing it's got names of everyone
who's ever paid off Paddy or been paid.
We suspect it has the names of dirty cops.
Jane isn't dirty!
The only way we're gonna clear the good cops
is to find the dirty ones.
Book.
Book will keep you safe.
Is Jane's friendship with me hurting her?
Because if it is, blame me, not her.
Don't you touch her!
It's okay, buddy. It's okay.
Don't. Your sutures.
Please, lie back down.
It's okay, buddy. Calm down. Calm down.
Lie back down. I am fine, okay?
I want I.A.D. people on the door 24/7
until he's in lock-up, and I want that book.
Maura.
Is Maura here?
No. Why are we whispering?
Do you remember when you thought you and Becky Zisti
were never gonna be friends again?
I didn't shoot Becky Zisti's father, ma.
You want some tea? It's from the Sichuan province.
It gets its flavor from pandas.
How does it get its flavor from pandas?
Maura says that the pandas fertilize the tea plants.
That means they grow it in panda poop, ma.
Y-you want me to fix you something?
What do you feel like eating?
People.
Come on. It's okay.
No, no. I don't want a hug.
Well, at least you're not Wally -- poor fella.
He should have just had my lasagna at the caf?
So much safer.
Did you really just say, "At least you're not Wally"?
Oprah says if you think of three good things
that happened to you during the day,
you'll perk right up.
Well, I'm not Wally, you stopped hugging me,
and I don't wear a size 11 shoe.
Gee, I feel so perky!
People can't help the size of their feet.
This is cheery.
Isn't it atmospheric?
Okay, you've been living here way too long.
I like it!
One of Constance's students drew it.
It's awful.
Like my life!
Is it okay if I just pat your knee?
Knock yourself out.
You know, your father and I
went to go see a marriage counselor once.
You did?
Wow. That was money well spent.
There was one thing Dr. Becker made us do...
...that worked for a little bit.
Is that when you had Tommy?
For heaven's sakes, Jane. We already had tommy.
Dr. Becker made us tell him our story --
about how we met.
Maura and I aren't a couple, Ma.
I'll stop hugging if you tell me the story!
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Get off, get off.
I was in the drug unit.
I was so frightened when you were doing that work.
If you interrupt or hug,
I'm done.
So, when you're a girl doing buy-busts,
you got to be a hooker.
Mother of mercy, you didn't have to do it.
Mom, no! Come on!
It was my cover. I told you.
Okay.
All right, so...
I don't have any I.D. I don't have any money.
I'm starving.
Come on, Stanley. You know I'm good for it.
I don't know anything about you...Tiffany.
Really? $2 for a day-old donut and bad coffee?
Please. Come on, I'll get you after my shift.
You think you'll make that much?
You know what?
I hope big mo tows your chevy,
I hope your crap coffee gives you an ulcer,
And you die of psoriasis.
Do you mind?
You can get your non-fat latte in a minute, all right?
No, it's for you.
And given the vitamin D deficiency --
likely from your, uh -- from your night work --
you're better off with some plain yogurt
and some leafy greens.
I have my lice under control, thank you.
But Stanley here has psoriasis.
Psoriasis is not contagious. It's a genetic disease.
What about rudeness? Is that genetic, too?
I was simply trying to be nice.
Well, not every hooker has a heart of gold.
All right, sister?
Apparently not, sister.
You shouldn't be here.
Not while they're investigating.
Why? What did you say to Connors?
I...
Well, you know I can't say anything.
Ma, get your stuff.
Jane Clementine Rizzoli!
What? Your middle name is Clementine?
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I thought it was pretty.
You're not staying here anymore.
What -- this isn't necessary.
What, because your family is so screwed up,
now you need mine?
What? You're the one who always says
that blood is thicker than water.
So, choose.
Hello?
That's water. I'm blood.
Okay, you know what? Suit yourself.
Sit here together and drink your excrement tea.
Jane!
Wait.
I'm...I'm just gonna grab a couple things.
Angela, wait.
Take it.
I've always hated it.
I'll be in the car.
You're like my daughter, too.
Ma, what are you doing in my bed?
That couch feels like a sack of marbles.
Get out!
You made me leave my luxuriana mattress
for this kind of treatment?
I'm sorry, ma. I'm sorry. Ma.
Ma. Ma?!
I'm not talking to you.
I am not talking to you until you say three nice things.
How are you not talking to me
if you're talking to me?
I...found all the lids to my tupperware,
And I-I...
don't have leprosy,
And...
And my really, really sweet mother left the comforts of her
free beacon hill guesthouse to come stay with me
in my crappy little apartment because she loves me.
Yes, I do.
No, no hugging. No hugging. No, no hugging.
Come on.
And this is where you tell me
that it's not a crappy little apartment.
Ma.
Ma!
Hi. What are you doing here?
I always have breakfast at ma's house when I do midnights.
This isn't ma's house.
No, thanks to you,
she's crashing on a piece of plywood you call a couch.
Oh, thanks to me? Well, I didn't see
you step up and help her out when dad left.
Okay, could you two fight after we've had breakfast?
Hey! Nice manners.
Your mother would be so proud.
No, she wouldn't!
Hey.
Thought flowers were better than a greeting card.
Well, that makes everything so much better.
Jane clemen--
Don't you say it!
I'm late for work.
If you're on a stakeout to nail that dirty cop,
Jane rizzoli, I see you.
You have to listen to me.
No, I don't. You're trespassing.
We have Paddy Doyle on a wiretap.
Just before he got shot.
You shouldn't be telling me this.
You could lose your job.
We know he's got people on the inside.
Inside the police department?
Whoever he was working with -- or maybe for --
Paddy is moving in to take over.
Well, what does this have to do with I.A.D. crawling up my or
do you think I'm working for Paddy, too?
I think you're being set up
so it looks that way.
Well, thank you for telling me.
Jane, um...I was ordered back to washington.
I wish -- mm-hmm.
Yeah, I wish, too.
Bye.
I thought you stopped with the jelly donuts.
Don't bust my balls.
You keep eating crap like that,
You won't be able to see your balls.
I don't need to see my balls.
20 grams of fat, dude.
What are you, a girl?
Guy gets a transfer to get off the street
And dies getting a sandwich.
Anything?
Photo of the gunman is out there.
Bad enough to lose one of our own
to some strung-out needle freak
who can't figure out how to use a frigging cash register.
This I.A.D. business
We'll come out clean.
All you need is the accusation.
That stink is hard to wash off.
I'm worried about losing
five years of good convictions.
What d-- what does he mean?
He means scum bags like little "T"
could use this as grounds for an appeal.
That is bullshit
Yeah, it is. But it's happened before.
Patrick sr. would be
rolling over in his grave
knowing that Paddy showed up to protect his own kid.
What are you talking about?
Well, the story in southie is that
Paddy fell in love with a Harvard girl.
Patrick sr. Threatened to kill them both
If he didn't give her up.
You think it was maura's mother?
Might have been.
Detective rizzoli is in autopsy.
Better get down there quick before she kills Pike.
She'll have to get in line.
Pretty sure his dental work didn't kill him.
If we could just -- just get that bullet.
You cannot rush these things.
Thought you said cause of death was quite clear.
I guess you're used to the antiquated
and sloppy methods of my predecessor.
Could be. Yes.
You know, I've never said it before,
But I'm a very big fan of your work, Dr. Pike.
You are?
You are?
I-I am. Yes.
And it would help us enormously in this very important case
if you could remove the bullet
So we could run it through ballistics.
Of course I can do that for you, detective Rizzoli.
What a mess this place is.
Um, aren't -- aren't you --
Aren't you gonna use your fingers?
Forceps can leave tool impressions.
Kind of messes with ballistics.
Of course I wasn't gonna use the forceps.
Think anybody would notice
if there was suddenly another corpse down here?
Excellent work, if I do say so myself.
Thank you.
Pretty big bullet.
For a .38.
Obviously a .45.
Obviously.
Would you, uh, run that to ballistics for me, please?
You're back.
Did you ever return my book,
"Soothing paint choices for the home"?
Yeah, a long time ago.
So, you're back.
That's odd, 'cause I can't seem to find it.
Did you ever return my "Guns of the world digest"?
I always return things I borrow.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure. Maybe you lost it.
You do lose things.
Has Dr. Pike been sitting in my chair?
Could be. Why? Is it broken?
You want me to find out
if he's been sleeping in your bed, too?
Were you looking for me?
What about your food?
Dr. Pike, have you been eating Maura's porridge?
Of course not.
I'm glad that you think you're so funny.
It's better to be funny than poindexter the know-it-all.
Well, I'd rather be poindexter the know-it-all
than the hoi polloi.
Good one, Maura.
You don't even know what it means.
It means "Common."
Literal translation is, "The great unwashed."
Classy.
Hide your insults in latin.
It's greek.
Oh, the geek that knows greek.
Do you realize how ridiculous you sound?
You know, people laugh at you behind your back.
Really?
Well, they call you a bitch behind yours.
Yes, I'm keeping a safe distance.
I'm gonna have to put you on speaker.
Well, at least when my father gets pissed off,
He doesn't stab people with an ice pick!
Well, at least my father didn't move to Florida
to sleep with some floozie he met at a pizza parlor!
Maura.
Or was it a massage parlor?
Oh, look at you!
Going all trailer-trash-snooki...
I watched that show once!
Give me that.
Once! It was for ethnographic research!
Break it up, ladies. What's going on?
What the hell is happening in your house, lieutenant?
I've got it under control.
I can see that -- a homicide detective
and a medical examiner having a cat fight
that needs police intervention!
A cat fight?
Did you really just call a disagreement
between female colleagues a cat fight?
Actually, aggression between two females is --
Oh, for the love of pete, stop!
I want detective Rizzoli placed on leave.
I'll go one step better.
Rizzoli, I'm transferring you out of homicide.
What?
What?
You got 30 seconds
to get your ass over to evidence management.
Place me on leave! Don't send me there!
Go now!
What about Dr. Isles?
She was part of the cat fight, too.
You're in charge now.
I am?
What's in that envelope?
My resignation.
Oh, no.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
This isn't a burglary.
Somebody was looking for something.
Did your father ever mention a book?
No.
But Captain Connors is looking for it, too.
We have Paddy.
And if he lives, he can name all the dirty cops himself.
Why do you need the book?
Because Paddy Doyle will never testify.
That's why he's still alive.
But if you could get your hands on that book,
you can run Boston.
How?
There's more than dirty cops on Paddy's payroll --
City workers, politicians, maybe even judges.
Frankie, call operations.
I want you to stay with Dr. Isles.
Jane didn't know Dean would be there.
Is that why you resigned?
I'm the daughter of a mobster.
You're all under investigation for trying to protect me.
If you're done with the crossword puzzle, detective,
how about you break down these seized guns?
Parts go in the evidence barrel here.
That better be vodka or strychnine.
Whoa.
You're melting down a desert eagle?
What a waste.
Unless you want to sneak it out in your pants.
There's no room.
Come on. I feel like shooting stuff.
You sure?
I am an evidence clerk.
I need to test-fire these weapons.
Now, let's live dangerously. Take the whole box.
We're gonna -- you know, with these guns.
Just a little test fire.
Yeah!
I could do this all day.
Right.
Sleep with a federal agent.
Forget to put a BOLO out for Paddy Doyle.
Have a cat fight.
He didn't really say that.
Oh, yes, he did.
Well, you gals do tend to do a lot of squealing
when you get upset.
Shut up.
Hey, Frost.
Look at the lands and grooves on this bullet.
This is the bullet from the desert eagle in evidence.
And this is the one from Wally's back.
No doubt about it -- these are from the same gun.
That means this is the gun that killed Wally.
Which means the killer is someone in BPD.
Come in.
Sir, there's something you need to see.
I was starting to worry about you, Rizzoli.
What took you so long?
You put me there on purpose, didn't you?
We suspected Paddy had someone in evidence,
so, figured who best to keep an eye on things
than pissed-off Jane Rizzoli?
We get caught,
we're here to get Wally's dress uniform
to bury him in, got that?
Got it.
How much overtime was Wally doing?
Is that a pepperbox derringer?
Wally's bought himself a dive shop.
That's Belize!
I always wanted to go fishing there.
Except it's catch and release.
You don't even eat fish.
Be nice to mount a big tuna.
A big tuna?
Do you hear yourself?
Um...why does Wally
have all this money to buy a dive shop and mount a tuna?
Looks like he was playing a different game.
You know who these two altar boys are?
The kid on the left is Wally. The taller one is Paddy.
We heard some chatter on the wire
that Paddy was about to make a big score
before he got hit.
What, you thinking it was seized guns?
Yeah, I do.
BPD seizes close to a thousand guns a year.
Good scam.
Cops seize the guns, Paddy takes them from us.
A million bucks right there
if you can figure a way to get it out of here.
How?
They're logged in, weighed,
and dropped into these barrels.
Armored car takes them away to be melted down.
They don't even tell
command staff when they're moving them.
Maybe Paddy was intercepting the trucks.
Think we'd have heard about it.
You know, Dean told me something.
Okay. Don't tell us what you were doing when he told you.
I want to hear what they were doing.
The FBI thinks cops on Paddy's payroll
were about to make that move.
Now would be the time with Paddy in the I.C.U.
First to go, Paddy's boy, Wally.
They can't do anything without the guns.
Let's find them.
Wally swapped this one out with scrap metal.
Oh, my God!
What the hell is going on?
I'm sorry, John.
Me too.
Cliff was my partner. I trusted him.
Looks like it could be a .44.
This is a .44.
The Desert Eagle.
Probably the same gun he used to kill Wally.
Then somebody used it on him.
What do we do now?
Seal the drum.
Put it back where it was.
Rizzoli, put that gun back.
What?
Until we find out who's behind this.
If homicide starts investigating Cliff's murder,
whoever ran this will go underground.
Well, wait a second.
If the barrels are full of scrap metal and...Cliff,
where are the guns?
This place is the size of four football fields.
It'll take all night.
Where would Wally hide them?
Here -- here it is. Here it is.
Oh, Wally had a sense of humor.
They hid their stash in Paddy's boxes.
Everything stays put for now, got it?
Let's lock it up and get out of here.
Wait. Look at this.
These are surveillance photos of Doyle from 1976.
Do you think that's the Harvard babe?
Ma, where is it?
Where is what?
That really creepy drawing that Maura gave you.
Where is it? Get it.
Why?
Just get it. I promise I won't hurt it.
Please.
Oh, my God! Who is she?
Maura.
Maura is fine, Patrick.
Maura.
Hope.
Who is this?
It's Maura's mother.
What's her name?
I don't know. I never knew.
He drew this?
Yeah, he showed up at my art class at Harvard.
I thought he was a student.
I tried to encourage him.
Then he just -- he disappeared.
And then, what, you found yourself pregnant with Maura?
No.
Paddy showed up months later
with a newborn in his arms.
He said the baby's mother had died during childbirth.
Why didn't his family take Maura?
His father would have killed the baby.
He didn't trust anybody...but me.
Why did he draw this?
They used to meet at the Boston Cemetery.
It's the only place they were safe from his father.
Paddy told everyone that Maura and her mother had died.
What if Maura's mother is still alive?
I think a parent would do anything to keep his child safe.
Even lie to the woman he loved and tell her her baby died?
Even that.
Jane.
Shh, Ma.
Good work, detective. Where is it?
No.
No book.
Oh, I found something else.
It looks like you're the dirty cop.
And you killed your partners Wally and Cliff.
I'll see you in hell, you son of a bitch.
Looking forward to it, Paddy.
I could scream.
Go ahead. My guys are on the door.
Smart. My fingerprints are all over that thing.
Well, I'm lucky like that, detective.
You got any last words?
Yeah.
You feeling lucky right now?
No firing pin.
I took them out of all the guns.
That's not luck. That's just covering my bases.
Get your hands on your head!
You heard him, get them up!
You're not gonna have to wait for hell
to see your buddy, Paddy.
You okay?
Yeah.
Good work, Rizzoli.
Now get out of those khakis and get back to homicide.
Thanks, boss.
And you get better so we can move you to Walpole.
I want to know something. Would you have shot her?
Yeah.
You're a cop.
I got something I need to show you.
I always wondered why she never looked for me.
Is there anything I can do?
Please go.
Wait.
There is one thing.
