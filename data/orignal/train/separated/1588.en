I'd like Callie to spend one day a week with her father.
I will see Robert, but I won't see anyone else.
There's nothing that you can say that will make me forgive you.
If you don't forgive me, I'll kill myself.
I've done everything I'm supposed to,
they still won't give me visitation.
Take this with you and you go up to the door and you knock.
That's a little over my budget.
This bracelet just went on sale. Sixty percent off.
Why don't you just move in until the baby's born?
You didn't tell me Ana's pregnant.
Mom told me not to.
She can't take care of a baby, Mom.
Even with Mike's help.
I can't believe you told your mom... again.
I can't be friends with a little bitch that
tells his mom every time something happens.
Idyllwild would like to offer you a full ride
to their summer music program.
It's not gonna be some kind of crazy,
drug-fueled, you know, trashing hotels kind of tour.
We'll set aside enough money
to make sure we're staying in motels.
Oh, my God. That is huge. Why would you do this?!
'Cause I wanted to show Hayley how much I liked her.
Hayley, huh?
Sounds like a real heartbreaker.
Can it be removed?
Well, luckily it's just black ink.
That's the easiest to break down.
Break down?
We zap it with a laser and the body eventually absorbs the ink.
Does the zap hurt?
Did it hurt when you got it?
Hell, yeah.
Unfortunately, it hurts more to get rid of it.
Feels like the snap of a hot rubber band against your skin.
How long does it take?
Five minutes.
That's not bad.
Per session.
I'm guessing you're looking at about ten.
Ten?
Minimum.
With seven weeks healing time in between.
Seven weeks to heal?
Is there scarring or risk of infection?
Not if he follows all the care instructions.
Should we get started today?
Today?
Sure, why not?
Please, Mom. Do I have to do this?
Do you want Hayley's name on your body for the rest of your life?
No. Can't I just, like, cover it with a dragon?
Everything you do has consequences, Jesus.
I'm sorry that this one has to be painful.
Now is the time I need you to put on the glasses.
If you'll just lie back.
I need you to roll over onto your side.
All right.
Just try and relax.
Here we go.
I know, right?
Is it gone yet?
No, it takes months.
And it's torture.
Sounds like your relationship with Hayley.
Yeah, but the tattoo will last longer.
You know, if you add a few extra
letters you could turn it into "Epic Fail...y."
Ha-ha, very funny. I get it.
OK? I'm an idiot.
You're not an idiot.
That's what everyone thinks.
That's not true.
Everyone stop teasing him.
Yeah, before we go around this table
and call you out on all the mistakes you guys have made.
So, uh, any idea when you guys
might decide if I can go on tour this summer?
Just the band really needs to know.
Yes, we have actually decided.
We've discussed it at great length with your father
and we all agree that you can go.
What? I can?
Are you insane?! After all the dumb stuff he's done?
He sold fake IDs at school!
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
You really think that you can trust him to spend all summer
driving around in a van with
a bunch of kids playing dive bars and raves?
There's not gonna be any raves. What's with the sabotage?
Listen, we are well aware of the potential for misadventure here.
Which is why we have conditions.
What conditions?
They want to meet our parents?
Well, yeah. You know, just to, uh, get on the same page.
About what?
About, like, uh...
you know, that we'll be checking in a couple times a day.
And, uh, you know, that we have a plan.
Like an itinerary?
We're not going on a cruise.
Yeah. Plans change, depending on gigs that might come up.
We won't know in advance, where we'll be every night.
Yeah, no, no. I know. I know.
It's more of like an overall, kind of general idea.
Uh, and there's another thing.
They want us to stay in motels.
But I did the math,
and, you know, if we all stay
in one room at one of those $99-a-night places,
then it's only $25 bucks each.
Times 20 nights.
Five Benjamins a person? No way.
My buddy did a tour last summer,
they always found somewhere to crash.
Look, it's, it's... non-negotiable.
My parents want us to stay in motels or they won't let us go.
Well... won't let you go.
What, like you'd go without me?
Jesus! What is that?
It's my bandage.
That is so gross.
What's your deal tonight?
I don't have a "Deal."
Tell that to Brandon.
Hey, look, I just don't think
that he should be out on the road all summer.
You don't think Mat should be out on the road all summer.
With all those groupies flashing their boobs in his face.
Shut up.
And stop leaving your hazardous waste around.
It's disgusting and rude.
This is your fault.
You narc'ed to Moms about my tattoo.
Because I had to hear about Ana from Epic Fail-y.
Because you freaked the hell out any time I mention her.
Will you please throw that away?
And I'm done freaking out about Ana
because I'm never having a relationship with her.
What about her baby? It's gonna be our brother or our sister.
Have you thought about that?
So, how come Connor doesn't come over anymore?
Um... I don't know.
We sort of had a fight.
About what?
Just stuff.
I don't want to talk about it.
That's my line.
Yeah, well, you're not the only one who gets to use it.
Ouch.
OK. Sorry I care.
You know, I was thinking about tomorrow,
when you go see Robert.
What about it?
He said he just wants a relationship with you, right?
I mean, if that's all he wants,
why can't you just call him "dad," or whatever.
You know, play along.
See him once a week.
And then maybe he'll back off.
I don't think it's that simple.
How do you know?
What're you working on?
Oh, just these grant applications.
If we don't get our English API scores up, we won't even qualify.
I cannot believe Timothy...
Did I tell you Ana is living with Mike?
I mean, he says it's only temporary
until she gets a job and finds her own place.
But you know what I think?
I think that it's Dani all over again.
Has he forgotten what Ana did?
I wonder what the hell his sponsor's telling him.
I'd like to know. Seriously...
Seriously, I am sick of talking about Mike.
I'm sorry, I'm just...
Obsessed with every bad decision he makes.
That affects our children.
So we keep our kids safe and away from Ana.
That's all we can do, or should do.
We don't want to add Mike's problems to our plate.
We already have enough stress as it is.
I'm sorry, love. You were talking about Timothy?
No, just... You know what,
I'm tired.
The grant. I'm all ears, love.
Let's go to sleep.
Good night.
Love you.
I love you, too.
Can I help you find something?
Uh, no thanks. I'm just looking.
For...?
Uh, a gift for a girl.
Uh, my sister. She's 14.
What's she into?
I'm not sure, ...
...clothes, Emo, horses.
You must be close.
No, we didn't... We don't live together.
Wow, those are perfect.
I'll ring you up over here.
Ten dollars.
Nice bracelet. Did you get that here?
Uh, my brother did, I think.
It was a Christmas present.
I remember him.
You were here around then too.
You bought a little toy?
Yeah. Good memory.
I hope your sister likes them.
Me, too. Thanks.
I could have got that.
It's OK.
You're the pregnant one. I should be waiting on you.
Well that is the least I can do.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So, I'll pick you up this afternoon,
take you to your doctor's appointment.
You don't have to drive me.
I want to.
I was thinking of calling her Isabella.
What do you think?
I think that's a beautiful name.
Hey, Brian.
I'm Stef Adams-Foster.
We met a few months ago when Mike got his 90-day chip.
The first one.
Right. You're the ex-wife.
Yeah.
And you are his sponsor, yes?
Hey, I was looking for you.
You were?
Yeah, uh,
can we switch lab partners?
It's just, uh, Daria asked me to be her partner, so...
Yeah. Uh, it's cool.
Oh, uh, Jude?
Yeah.
The potato?
Taylor has yours.
Sucks getting sexiled.
"Sexiled?"
When your friend leaves you hangin' for their new boo.
When did they become... boos?
Like, five minutes ago.
But if you ask Daria, they're "OTP."
But, hey, I'm down with being partners if you are?
Yeah... totally down.
We just have to take everything out.
Yeah.
You ready for the Algebra midterm?
Yeah. No.
Why?
Coach wanted me to ask.
He's trying to make sure the
star of the team doesn't go on academic probation.
"Star of the team."
Never been a fan of false modesty, Foster.
Well I've been studying... a little.
I will because I broke up with Hayley.
You broke up with her?
Yeah.
So now I'll be completely focused on the midterm, I swear.
Well, you should probably get a tutor.
Yeah. That's a good idea.
Could you tell Coach that I won't let the team down?
I promise.
Hey, Jude! Come here.
Oh, my God, Taylor was just telling us
how funny you were in science class today.
Sit. Come have lunch with us.
Ok.
Did you guys get your bulb lit?
Uh, yeah. Creepy to think
there's electricity in your french fries.
So, who's dying to see Bright Lights?
We read the book last summer and we are totally obsessed.
What's the movie about?
It's a chick flick.
Hey, why don't we all go see it tonight as a group?
Yeah, sure. Sounds good.
Yeah.
Uh, I have to make sure I can.
There's a 7:00 and my mom can totally drive us.
Here, just put your number in my phone.
Awesome.
We have to go to the bathroom before class.
I guess I have to pee.
See you later.
If you want, I can...
...I can say my moms won't let me go.
No. No, it's fine. I don't mind if you go.
So is Daria your girlfriend?
I guess.
Yeah.
I didn't know you... liked her.
Well, she's hot.
Uh... do you like Taylor?
Yeah. She's nice.
We're probably gonna be the only dudes in the movie theater.
Yeah, probably.
Hey, brainiac. Lunch?
How about... Yo shorty, wanna eat?
I can't. I'm having lunch with Tia.
We've gotta talk about dance team auditions.
Aw, come on. There's a...
There's a half PB&J in it for you.
The organic kind where the
peanuts were sung to every night by the farmers.
OK, look,
I know you don't think that
my dance team is as important as your band,
but I have to have something
to do all summer while you're off on tour.
OK. Um...
Sorry, I...
But I'll see you later tonight after practice?
I don't know. I have to study.
Midterms are coming up and
I've got tons of coding to do for STEM Club.
Is everything cool with us?
I'm just really busy.
What does that mean? Busy, like, tonight or...
I just don't think that I have time for a relationship right now.
So, um...
Can we talk about this later?
Tia's waiting on me.
You talked to my sponsor?
Do you know how inappropriate that was?!
As inappropriate as your relationship with Ana?
What? That's none of your business!
And none of your sponsor's either, apparently.
You had no right, Stef.
What, to tell him about Ana?
He had no idea who she was.
It was an invasion of my privacy and the program.
The program? You're not working the program, Mike.
You're not even being honest with your own sponsor.
You don't get to take my inventory.
No, but I do get to protect my children.
From the woman who abused them
and then wormed her way back into their lives.
She's not that person anymore.
And took advantage of them.
Just like she's taking advantage of you.
Because you're so afraid that you
can't save yourself without saving someone else.
You don't what the hell you're talking about!
She almost destroyed your life, Mike!
Maybe that's what you want. Maybe you want to self-destruct.
Maybe that's easier than staying sober.
Shut up. You can steamroll over
everybody in your life, but not me.
So why don't you mind your own business
and get the hell out of my life.
You got that?
Hello?
Hey, uh, it's me.
I got hung up. I'm on my way.
It's OK. I'll call the doctor.
I'm sure we can reschedule.
I'm really sorry.
Do we need anything from the store for dinner?
No. We're fine.
Don't rush.
I'll see you soon.
Sorry.
So where's he taking you?
Don't know. Don't care.
You just have to spend a few hours with the man.
Yeah, a few awful awkward hours.
Cut him a break. He just wants to see his kid.
So, um, have you heard anything about Tasha?
I get my first supervised visit on Saturday.
What? Why didn't you tell me?
I don't wanna jinx it.
Aren't you excited?
Yeah, but... last time I seen her...
She won't remember that.
What if she remembers being scared
'cause some stranger took her?
You're not a stranger. You're her mother.
At some level she's gotta feel that connection.
Do your moms know you're here?
No.
They don't want you to see me unsupervised.
I'm not really here to see you.
I mean, I came here because
the baby is my...
...is gonna be my...
Sister.
It's a girl.
I just...
I don't want her...
to go through what we did.
I don't want her to feel like she isn't enough.
And to spend her whole life
scared that people are gonna leave her.
And I just don't think that you can be a mother.
I don't think that you can take care of a baby.
And maybe... Maybe you can't help it, but...
I don't want another little girl to get hurt...
...like I did.
Hot date?
No.
Connor and I are going to a movie with some girls.
As a group.
As a group?
That's what people tell their parents
when they don't want them to know what they're really doing.
What are we really doing?
"Going to the movies."
A dark place you can do things with a girl
that you can't do in the light.
Hooking up?
Here. Walk into this.
Why?
Girls love a guy who smells good.
Hi, Mrs. Adams-Foster.
Emma, hi.
What are you... Are you here for...
Me. Hey.
OK. Are you two...?
No.
She's tutoring me.
Oh, good!
Great, actually. It's nice to see you, Emma.
Wanna get started? Go up?
Why don't you two use the dining room?
Sounds good.
Mm. You smell awfully nice.
I just showered.
Hello. Come on in.
Hey, Callie? Robert's here.
You have a beautiful home.
We like it. So does Callie.
You look nice.
Thank you.
So, have her home by, uh, what, ten?
Sounds good.
Do you need a sweater, honey?
No, it's OK.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
Love you.
Bye.
Thanks.
Don't forget to apply the distributive property.
OK. Then multiply.
And express as a rational function.
Boom!
You got it.
You're the only one who gets me to understand this crap.
"F times "G" times "X"?
Without you, it looks like somebody barfed up alphabet soup.
Thanks for doing this.
Yeah, just takin' one for the team.
So... You're miserable?
Completely.
I'm really sorry.
For what?
I should've been honest about hooking up with Hayley.
I mean, technically we were broken up...
So "technically" this doesn't sound like a real apology.
It is. Last few months, I made some stupid decisions.
Really stupid decisions.
It's OK.
I forgive you.
And... I've missed you.
I miss you, too.
Wh... What're you doing?
You need to get a new tutor.
Wait!
Maybe a guy.
No, no. I need you.
We can be friends, I swear.
Look! I'll prove it to you.
That picture there was taken with a Hasselblad.
It has that... that, like,
look-down-style viewing screen, you know,
and a hand crank to advance the film.
You ever shot with film?
No, just digital.
I'd like to, it just costs too much to develop.
Well, you could always set up your own dark room,
learn how to develop yourself.
Yeah well, there's, uh...
...there's not really a lot of extra space where I live, so...
Well, anyway, the Hasselblad is responsible
for that beautiful blur you see in the photograph.
They call it "bokeh."
You can't get that kind of effect with a digital camera really.
How do you know so much about photography?
Well, it's, uh...
It's always been a hobby that I share with Sophia.
You know, actually, you both have a better eye than I do.
How's she doing?
Well, her doctors think it's some kind of
personality disorder.
I'm not entirely sure what that means, to be honest with you.
She's on medication,
which is helping.
But they want her to stay at the treatment center
a little while longer,
just so they can...
...you know, keep an eye on her.
I'm really sorry I didn't realize how sad she was.
We didn't either, and we're her parents.
I got her a gift.
A pair of hair pins with horses on them.
I don't know if she'll like it.
Are you kidding me? She'll love them.
Especially since they're from you.
Thank you.
What, are you not a fan of cilantro?
Yeah, I don't really like it.
It kind of tastes like...
Soap?
Hold on.
You think that showing me
you got the name of the girl who you hooked up with
a hot minute after we broke up,
tattooed over half your torso,
is proof that we can be friends?
Because... knowing you did something that stupid means that
I won't ever be attracted to you again.
And if you know that
I won't ever be attracted to you again, then...
...you won't try to get back together with me?
Yes.
That is some strange logic.
But it kind of makes sense, right?
Well, I definitely never want to see you shirtless ever again.
Please, Emma. Wrestling's all I have.
Everything else I screw up.
If I fail Algebra
I'll just be a loser with a stupid tattoo.
OK.
I'm getting the tattoo removed, though.
Jesus, just quit while you're ahead.
I never get to order this.
Jill and Sophia are always insisting on something chocolate.
No, chocolate is too obvious.
Cheers to that.
So... have you ever seen
the "Ashes and Snow" exhibit?
No, I've never heard of it.
They're these unbelievable photographs
of humans and animals in nature.
I mean, they're.. There's just no words that describe it.
It's... It is breathtaking.
Wow, I'd love to see it.
Well, It's in La Jolla right now. It closes this weekend,
but if you're interested and willing,
you know, maybe we could drive up for the day on Sunday.
I mean, it's... You know, it's not a...
Court-mandated?
Yeah. It's elective, as they say.
I'll ask Stef and Lena.
Right.
You know, you don't have to get custody of me to hang out.
If what you want is a relationship,
we can have that, even if I get adopted by the Fosters.
I don't just want to hang out, Callie.
I want to be your dad.
Well, you are my dad. Genetically.
That's not gonna change if I get adopted.
I guess I mean, parent. I want to be your parent.
And what about Jude?
You think it's OK to separate us because you want to "parent" me?
No, look, that's not what I want.
But that's what would happen.
Jude can come over whenever he wants.
I mean, he can have his own room.
That's not what I want. Does that not matter to you at all?
Callie, if I had known about you earlier,
I would have adopted him.
Well, it's too late.
That's because Jude's dad couldn't take care of him or you.
But I can.
Why? Because we both hate cilantro and you're rich?
Drive me home, please?
And I'll pass on Sunday.
Where should we sit?
Wherever you want.
Oh, actually... Why don't we sit in the back?
Or we could just sit right there.
Yeah, but if people are talking during the movie,
it's quieter in the back.
Connor?
Yeah. Yeah, it's cool.
Yeah, I... Yeah.
Cool.
She has to sit on the aisle.
Claustrophobic.
No, you're not. She has a small bladder.
Taylor!
I just drink a lot of liquids.
It's good for you.
Sorry, if they start making out
it'll be really weird sitting right next to them.
Thanks. It won't be weird for me at all.
爱德怀镇来访
Hey. No band practice tonight?
Oh, later.
Looking for jobs to pay for stupid motel rooms.
I bet you won't think clean sheets and warm showers
are so stupid on the road.
If I'm on the road.
I don't know how I'm gonna make two grand before summer.
What, I thought you guys were splitting it?
Oh, yeah, you thought. But...
the rest of the band doesn't have to listen to what you say.
And their parents don't care where they stay.
They trust them.
We are trusting you by saying yes, Brandon.
OK, but with all these conditions that I'm never gonna be able to meet,
it's like, why bother? It's not a yes, it's a backdoor "No."
Does Dad care where we stay?
Your dad and I are on the same page.
Yeah, your page.
OK, listen to me.
If the band wants to go on the road...
Then they will go on tour without me.
we need to talk.
I am sorry that I went to your sponsor.
I admit that I over-stepped.
But I have been very worried about you, Mike.
And you know we have a son together,
so maybe we can get together for a cup of coffee this weekend.
'Cause I love you.
Can you think of a better reason? I can't.
I'll let you go if you can look me in the eye
and tell me that you don't feel what I feel.
Tom, it's... It's too much.
I know you want this, Kendra.
I can see it in your eyes.
All right, let's call it.
Why were you coming in so late on that pre-chorus?
It was close enough.
You're the one always harping on timing.
I'll fix it next time.
So what should we do tonight?
Go out? Stay in?
You don't think your moms will come in here will they?
No.
Do you want to talk about it?
There's nothing to talk about. Right?
You'll go on tour with or without me.
What do you expect us to do?
Nothing.
But, you know, if I can't go,
what, are you just gonna play my songs?
They're our songs.
That I wrote.
I mean, who's gonna do the harmonies, Jasper?
Hey, we were a band before you.
Not a very good one.
Ego much?
I just mean that you're better with me.
No one's denying that, Brandon, but...
That's rock and roll, I guess. Every man for himself, right?
OK, look...
We all know you're a huge part of this band.
And, yes, we are better with you.
It's just... $2,000 is a lot of money.
And we need to spend all of our time rehearsing,
not working minimum wage jobs.
Do you expect us to give up the chance to tour
because your parents won't let you go?
No.
We really want you to go.
I think I'm just gonna...be alone tonight.
Ok.
You think you can spare a minute for a guy
you may or may not be dating?
Sweet lair.
It's where I hatch all my plots
to break up with guys for no reason.
So... what's going on? Are you OK?
Is it the tour?
Because I'll be away for three weeks of our first summer together?
Do you want to add anything here, or...
No, that's pretty much it.
Well, you know, there's this thing called a telephone.
And I, I hear you can...
You can take them anywhere now.
I know.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna... I'm gonna miss you, too.
I want to go on tour,
but it's not like I'm looking forward to
the part where you're not there.
Because...
...I love you.
Shut up.
I love you, too.
And you know, we wouldn't have to miss each other at all
if I went on tour with you.
But... would your moms let you?
Well, they're letting Brandon, they have to let me.
Yeah, but he's in the band.
Well... I could be your manager.
Sell merch, take pictures, tweet.
And keep an eye on my brother,
which I think my moms would love.
I think it's a great idea! Don't you?
Yeah, sure.
What do you do working in the weekend?
I could ask you the same.
I don't have a life.
What's your excuse?
Well, why don't you have a life?
Well...
I just moved to San Diego.
So I'm still making friends, I guess.
And... I'm single, now.
I'm recently divorced.
Sorry.
I'm not.
Well, marriage is... hard sometimes.
Yes, and so is winning grants.
Which is what I'm doing here.
Me, too. I know we need to talk about Timothy.
It's a tough decision.
Which is yours to make, but...
Not mine, alone. We're partners.
Any decision we make about the future of Anchor Beach,
I want us to make together.
Would you mind talking to my wife?
I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that.
It's OK. I understand. I've been there.
And, like you said, marriage is hard.
Well, it's Saturday and I don't want to be here all day, so...
Yeah, I'll see you later.
Bye.
Callie?
I'm Detective Hernandez, SDPD.
This is my partner, Detective Maslow.
I know you're working, can we ask you a few questions?
what about?
You were in a store yesterday on Magnolia called Playclothes?
Yeah. I was buying a gift for someone.
And what about back in December, around Christmas Eve?
You were shopping in the same store, is that right?
Why?
Do you remember buying this?
Because the sales person remembers selling it to you.
I don't understand, is that a crime?
No. But kidnapping is.
Uh, I'm 16.
I thought, uh...
Aren't I allowed to have a parent here
when you ask me questions?
Sure. Call your parents.
We'll wait.
Hey. What's going on?
Hey.
Uh, we have company.
Uh, Mariana came to see me yesterday... at Mike's.
Yeah? What did she want?
She wanted to talk about, um, this baby.
She's concerned I can't care for her.
Well, we'll talk to Mariana about leaving you alone.
She told me that she thought I should ask you
to adopt the baby.
And I think it's a good idea.
I think that she should grow up with her brother and sister
and people...
parents who aren't recovering addicts...
...who she could depend on.
So I feel really...
