第十一集
Everyone take a ribbon. As long as we hold these ribbons,
we will be there for each other.
It was an accident. Please, Gerda.
You killed our sister. You're a monster.
Who is that? Another friend?
I don't remember any of this.
Bloody hell. Is that...
Yeah.
This spell of yours...
It'll bring out the darkness in everyone in this town.
It'll do more than that.
They will tear themselves apart until everyone is dead.
You have traveled a great distance,
but I can help you.
Madame Faustina is here.
Sorceress,
can you use your powers of crystal gazing
to show me a girl not yet born?
This girl is special to you?
Very much so.
At the age of 28,
she will arrive in a town called Storybrooke.
Madame Faustina knows all. Come.
The crystal ball awaits.
How will you express your gratitude?
Thank you.
Payment. How -- how will you pay me?
Will this do?
Spirits of the ball,
hear me and obey.
I see...A child.
Yes.
A girl...
Who is...special.
Yes. She has many gifts. Tell me more.
The child's name is...
Susan.
Liar!
Her name will be Emma Swan!
The apprentice's scroll promises this!
I don't know nothin' about a scroll.
Now get outta here or you're gonna get a wicked beating.
Where I'm from,
charlatans such as yourself are severely punished.
Last warning, fruitcake. Hit the bricks.
Your trickery changes nothing.
I will find Emma.
She is coming, and I will find her.
And I will wait for her as long as I must.
And then I will have what I deserve.
He's coming! He's coming!
And I ain't happy!
Prince Charming.
Finally I've seen you clearly.
And what do you see?
A fraud.
A shepherd who has no business being royalty.
Well, I see a spoiled little princess
who ran away from her troubles,
who always runs away!
I can't believe I had a child with you.
Oh, who knows? Maybe you didn't.
Could be Whale.
You know, if this is what marriage is like,
I'm glad you keep postponing ours.
You don't mean that, Kristoff. It's the spell.
No. I'm seeing clearly now, too.
I'm beginning to think that this haircut wasn't my only bad idea.
I know this isn't really you. I know it.
But it's still upsetting, so I'm just...
I'm gonna go see my sister.
And you just stay here handcuffed
where you can't hurt anybody... but me...with your words.
My parents -- that's not who they are.
They're their worst selves.
It's like when Anna put me in that urn.
She didn't mean what she said either...I hope.
I didn't. That doesn't make any of this less horrible.
It's okay. You're immune. We all are. And we're together.
It's gonna be all right. Remember, I'm the savior.
That's, like, a real job here?
Apparently, it is.
I promised all these people I'd get them their happy endings.
And I will. I'm just not sure how at this moment.
I think I might have an idea.
Do you know how the Snow Queen got the idea for the curse?
It's from a legend called the Trolden Glass.
Never heard of it.
Its origin isn't important.
What matters is how they broke the curse.
What was done?
To break the spell...
they had to kill the king.
So in this case, that would mean Ingrid.
I don't believe killing is ever the answer.
Are you sure we can't reason with her?
She's beyond that.
We all want another way,
but if it comes down to her or the town,
I'm gonna do what has to be done.
But...
We're out of options.
Anna, how are you with kids?
I love kids.
Wait.
Elsa, we should get going.
Wait. I'm the babysitter?
The Snow Queen is my aunt, too.
If this is what has to happen, I wanna be by your side.
Anna, sorry, but someone has to stay here with everyone else.
Emma's right. Stay with Kristoff.
But this was my plan.
I know it was.
You're the smartest person I know,
and you're my sister, which means you need to stay safe.
Ingrid is a problem that Emma and I have to solve.
Do you trust Emma?
I do. She's my friend.
Then go.
God!
Sealed in my own vault?!
This is...
This is...
This is the savior's doing.
I should've incinerated her years ago.
This is what I get for being subtle!
What the hell am I wearing?
I've missed you.
Where's the missus?
She turned homicidal on you yet?
None of your business. What kept you?
Well, it's like swimming with sharks out there.
The minute one of them tastes blood,
they'll tear each other apart.
Well, count your blessings you're not one of them.
Why was I spared the cloud's curse?
Because your heart wasn't in your chest, dearie.
It was here in my shop with me.
In protective custody, so to speak.
What is it you need, crocodile?
Once I finish packing,
I'm gonna take Belle to the town line.
I need you to find Henry and do the same thing.
So you still think you're leaving?
Oh, ye of little faith.
Tomorrow night, when the stars in the sky
align with the stars in the hat,
I shall finally cleave myself from this dagger
and be on the other side of that ice wall before dawn.
Are you saying there's a bloody way out of here?
Dark One always finds a way.
Well, if the Dark One is so powerful,
why doesn't he magic his grandson to his side?
Because that would require me knowing
where his mothers have locked him away for safekeeping.
Now unless you really, really have no need for that tongue,
I suggest you slither back outside into the hostile current
and find Henry.
You'll be needing this.
You won't win.
Villains never do.
Don't be ridiculous, dearie.
When Belle and Henry wake up tomorrow morning in New York City,
they won't remember a thing about tonight.
I'll tell them the Snow Queen destroyed Storybrooke,
whilst I saved everyone I could.
I won't be a villain.
I'll be a hero.
Stop.
This must end, Ingrid.
Our magic is a part of us now.
We control it, and we control it really well.
I'm so proud of you both.
You've finally embraced who you truly are.
Emma.
Again.
The love that flows through our ribbons
is without equal.
Its strength protects the life-force
that we all now share.
She's made it impossible for us to hurt her.
We gotta get these things off.
There's no need.
Soon,
you won't want to hurt me.
Soon,
you will love me.
For real.
Hey, look what the new girl brought with her.
Give it to me!
Give it back, Kevin.
The camera is Emma's, not yours.
We respect property in this household, don't we, Kevin?
Yes, ma'am.
Here you go, Emma.
It's okay, sweetie.
I know you're new here, but you're gonna be just fine.
Okay, lights out in 15!
Don't forget to brush your teeth!
It's your choice, sweetie.
You can either give me that camera tomorrow
or I can make your life a living hell.
I made us some cocoa.
Wanna join me?
No.
Suit yourself.
You know, by my account,
there are 15 separate subconscious signs or tells
that a new foster child displays when they're going to run away
on his or her first night.
In the brief time we were together,
you showed seven.
Not that I blame you.
When I was younger, I did the same thing.
You ran away?
I tried to.
People in my life, they, uh, they intervened.
Do you wanna know why?
Does it matter?
It did to me.
They stopped me because they cared about me.
Lucky you.
No. Lucky you.
Because now that you're living under my roof,
I'm gonna care for you the way they cared for me.
Yeah, well, don't waste your time.
I'm not interested.
Suit yourself.
Go. I won't stop you.
You won't?
No. Go on. More cocoa for me.
I understand how difficult it must be
to live under the same roof as someone like Kevin,
who's deathly afraid of spiders.
Any spiders, really.
Small spiders. Big spiders.
Even the rubber ones I keep in my desk.
In the drawer on the right.
Behind the box of staples.
Poor Kevin.
It's a shame you can't stay, Emma.
Maybe...
Maybe I could hang around for one more day.
Works for me.
Gold?
Belle?
You in here?
They're gone.
Then what do we do?
We do it ourselves.
Say something!
Dopey, say something!
Open your mouth! Speak, speak, speak!
Move it!
That's ridiculous.
At least I know how to swaddle our child correctly.
I swaddle him perfectly.
He's a baby, not a breakfast burrito.
Stop it. I mean, I have to say
I expected more from the two of you.
Use your heads.
Think back to what it was like before the spell changed you.
Sure, you had issues with each other, but they were minor.
Minor? Minor?
When I first met her, she hit me in the face.
If that wasn't a sign, I don't know what is.
Yes, you responded by hanging me in net from a tree.
You're a real Prince Charming.
Yes, he is Prince Charming, and you're Snow White.
And those things sound terrible but they also sound romantic.
Can't you see that?
'cause if you can see that,
then maybe you can defeat this dark spell.
Someone slip me a poison apple and put me out of my misery.
Oh! Me! Pick me!
Oh, shut it, ice man.
Ice man? Who you calling ice man, stable boy?
I'm calling you ice man. And you're from Arendelle.
What are you doing selling ice?
The whole place is frozen!
Ice is a very important commodity.
You know what, Swiss Miss? You do know me.
I pick flowers. I talk to birds.
I do all kinds of warm, fuzzy things.
And you know what else?
I kill.
Yeah, that's right.
Snow White's a murderer.
I killed the Evil Queen's mommy.
And I said I was sorry...
and it didn't mean it.
That's horrible.
Still wanna hold hands, sing "Zip-a-dee-doo-dah"?
I give up. It's useless.
The magic protecting this ribbon is just too powerful.
I guess the Snow Queen meant what she said about her love.
I'm sorry. I was too busy thinking of ways to punch her
to retain that.
She's said the love flowing through our ribbons
was without equal.
Maybe without equal,
but not without an opposite that's equally strong.
What?
If her amplified love put these ribbons on our wrists,
then maybe what we need
is someone's equally amplified hatred to get them off.
Emma, you're a bit prickly,
but you're certainly not hateable.
Tell that to Regina.
I'm prickly?
If you let Regina out
while she's under the influence of the Snow Queen's curse,
she'll kill you.
She'll try. But right now, it's...
A theory.
The best chance we have.
If Storybrooke wants to survive,
Regina needs to hate me like she's never hated me before.
What do I do? Help!
Don't look at me! You're driving!
I can't do it.
Concentrate.
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
Trust your instincts
and let it rip.
Don't let go.
Win.
Yes!
Let's see what you won.
I love it.
This is a great lesson, Emma.
If you push yourself and you ignore the flickering lights
and the distractions of this world,
you can accomplish anything.
Ingrid, it's a plastic ring, not a scholarship to Yale.
I know, but you're a special girl, Emma.
And someday, you're gonna surprise everybody
with your extraordinary gifts.
Okay, now you're going overboard.
I'm serious.
I'm glad I got to know you.
Ingrid, are -- are you crying?
No, just...
a little emotional.
I'm being sent away again.
What?
That's why we spent the day together.
No.
It's why you're crying.
No. You couldn't be more wrong.
Then what is it?
I'm...
I'm filling out the paperwork to adopt you.
We're gonna be a family.
Are you serious?
I know that it's a big leap.
And you may not look at me as a mother.
I know how hard that is. But...
I-I promise
I will be the best big sister
that you could ever hope for.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Okay, stand back.
Containment spell. Okay.
Here goes.
You can do it.
Okay.
Well, I'm still getting the hang
of the controlling the magic thing.
But lucky for us, the next part should be easy for me.
What's that?
Be prickly.
Whoa. Little late for Halloween.
You.
How do you walk in that thing?
With the poise and composure of a queen.
Perfect timing, Miss Swan.
I was just reading up on how to turn you into a garden topiary.
What's she doing here?
I wanted to see your face when you learned the truth.
The truth about what?
I lied to you, Regina, about Marian.
I knew all along. I brought her here on purpose.
Tell me something I don't know.
What you don't know is why.
Not only did I wanna break your heart,
I wanted to see me and Hook together,
see the happiness you could never have,
and ruin it again, just like my mother did.
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Let's go.
Swan!
Henry.
I know you're in there, mate.
I need you to come with me now.
There's no way I'm going anywhere with a dirty pirate.
Dirty?
I bathe quite frequently, thank you very much.
I never liked you, and I like you even less
now that you and my mom are together.
Emma used that word? "Together"?
Go!
Okay.
Henry, I need to bring you somewhere safe.
All right.
I'm coming in!
Henry!
I'm just trying to do what's best for you!
I've been looking for you, pirate.
Come to pay you back for that shiner you gave me.
Now's not the time, mate.
Oh, it bloody well is the time!
Now let's see how hard you are
without your girlfriend 'round to protect ya.
Henry!
It's nights like this
I wish I just had the power to poof home like Harry Potter.
If I was like him,
I could be standing here in the cold one minute,
and home soaking in the tub in the next.
That would be something, wouldn't it?
Emma...
Emma, do you remember
how much fun we had in the arcade last week?
Of course. Best day I've had in a long time.
How could I forget?
And do you remember
how the lights in the game flickered
right before you won?
Yeah. Weird.
What if it was more than just weird?
What if it meant that you were on the cusp
of a great self-revelation?
I think it's time.
What are you doing?!
Stop the car.
What?!
Trust your instincts.
Do it! Stop the car!
Let go of me!
Emma!
I'm sorry.
Are you crazy?! You almost killed me!
I made a mistake.
When I was younger, I-I had a traumatic experience
that unleashed a power that I-I didn't even know that I had.
What are you talking about?
I thought the arcade was a sign
that you were coming into your own.
You think I have powers? Like Harry Potter?
No, Emma. That's fiction.
What you have is more real and more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.
Great.
I should've known the only person willing to adopt me
would turn out to be a nut job.
No. Emma -- - Don't touch me!
I thought...
Emma, wait.
Emma!
Emma!
Emma!
Isn't this my lucky day?
I had come here to kill Emma,
but now I get to kill
the two idiots who started it all.
Hey, I wasn't the one
that told Cora about your secret boyfriend.
Are you selling me out?
Shut up!
You both deserve to die.
Not just for what you did, but for your whining.
But your punishments should fit your crimes.
Mary Margaret, you took my first true love from me.
Now I'm going to return the favor
by taking your baby.
No!
Regina!
Please, your majesty, let's be reasonable.
You're under the Snow Queen's spell.
You don't actually hate Mary Margaret and David.
It does sound like she has her reasons.
Kristoff!
I don't know who you are,
but why don't you go back to where you came from?
Where was I?
Gonna use your magic, Regina?
You afraid to get your hands dirty?
I don't need magic to kill you.
Magic is too good for you.
I want to watch you bleed.
Take this.
When the time comes...
It will lead you to your third sister.
Hello, Storybrooke.
You two have no idea how long I've waited for this moment.
Your ribbons -- what have you done?
I'm not much for accessories.
Those ribbons joined us together.
Get it through your head, lady.
We're not your sisters and we're never gonna love you.
Oh, Emma.
I know that you actually believe that.
And...it makes me sad.
But I know that sadness won't last
Because soon, you'll see you're wrong.
Don't do it!
The hell are those?
They're memories I took from the two of you.
And now it's time to give them back.
Why? So we can remember just how badly you treated us?
The funny thing about time is we romanticize the good
and forget the bad.
That's exactly what's in these crystals.
These are the good memories and nothing else.
Lovely moments the two of you shared with me,
which I'll cherish forever
and now so will you.
I hate to break it to you,
but magic can't make someone love you.
You're right, Emma. Magic can't create love.
But if someone loved you in the past,
it can make them love you again.
And I know you've forgotten, Emma,
but you did love me.
You both did.
That's why...
right now,
you're not doing anything.
We all know the only way to stop me
is to kill me,
And you're both...
hesitating.
You don't have it in you.
Still open?
I need a couple of pints for my son. He loves this place.
Ingrid.
Emma.
What the hell are you doing here?
E-ever since you came to Storybrooke,
I've been waiting for you to come into my shop.
I wanted to give you your space, let you come to me.
My space? Are you out of your mind?
Are you following me?
There's so many things that I wanted to tell you,
so many things that I wanted to say.
And look at you. You're all grown up.
Don't touch me!
This makes no sense.
You don't look a day older. That was over 10 years ago.
After you ran away, I came to Storybrooke to wait for you.
And people don't age here the way they do
in a world without magic.
The apprentice was right.
He said that you would be here on your 28th birthday,
and here you are.
The apprentice? Magic?
You're even loonier than when I ran away.
I'm not, Emma. You know that this place is special.
You know that you're special.
Everything that Henry is telling you is true.
No. I know you screwed up my life. You're crazy.
Crazy then, crazy now! You tried to kill me!
Get out of my way. I'm gonna call sheriff Graham.
No, you're not calling anyone.
What's that, your pet rock?
No, Emma. No, it isn't.
It's magic from my world.
Oh. You okay?
What happened?
You slipped. You almost fell.
Do -- do you still want that ice cream?
Yeah. Two pints of cherry vanilla.
How about some rocky road?
Uh, on the house. You look like you could use it.
Have a taste.
Now that is rocky road.
It's delicious.
Wanna know my secret?
Lot of patience. Lot of love.
Careful! The stroller's not under warranty anymore!
You said you bought it new!
It was gently used!
Let me know when you're tired of missing, Mary Margaret.
I only have to hit you once.
My, my.
Aren't you a good a sleeper?
You think this spell has made me angry?
Do not wake my baby!
You said no magic.
And you said you could keep a secret!
I... was... 10!
Where did she send us?
She tried to send us back to where we came from,
and this was the closest spot.
Where are you going?
I'm going back to Arendelle, even if I have to swim there.
I don't think that's how portals work.
I mean, sure, I've only ever been through one,
but they seem pretty one-way.
I'm tired of this!
My life used to be simple --
just me and Sven.
No sister-in-law who sets off eternal winters.
No crazy aunt who wants to kill everyone I know.
No fiancee who delays my wedding for 30 years!
That wasn't my fault.
Okay, the first few weeks were,
but we were frozen for the rest of it!
You know what? I'm tired of listening to you,
and I'm tired of listening to reason.
I'm going back, and nothing you do will stop me!
Sorry, Kristoff, but you'll thank me later.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Close your eyes.
Kristoff.
Kristoff, do you have any idea what this is?!
Oh. Right. I knocked you out.
Wake up! We have to take this to Elsa!
Mwah! I love you! You're amazing!
You're unconscious.
I'll be right back. Stay here.
I mean, I know you'll stay here,
but I'll be be right back anyway!
It's okay.
Come.
Be my sisters.
I can't do it, Emma. I can't hurt her.
Yeah, well, I can.
Wait!
Stop!
Anna!
No, she's too dangerous.
You should listen to my sister and go.
Your sister? She's mine.
And whatever you're gonna do? Well...
Don't.
Elsa, I found this on the beach.
It's from our mother.
She must've thrown it into the ocean
before their ship sank.
It came over in the portal with us.
Oh, just be careful.
No, I'm not gonna be careful. She needs to hear this.
You all do.
"Elsa, Anna, I don't know
if your father and I will ever get back to you,
but I need you to know
we were wrong to tell Elsa to conceal her powers."
How fitting that you, who are so much like your mother,
should share her last words.
"I feel terrible that it happened before
and I can't let it happen again."
What?
"My sister Ingrid, like you, also had ice powers.
I never told you about her or my other sister Helga,
but I should have.
They were beautiful and kind and wonderful,
and I was fearful.
And I let that fear guide me.
I let Ingrid hide
When I should have celebrated her for the person she was.
I loved her so much."
You're lying!
My sister hated me! She called me a monster!
She put me in that urn, like you did Elsa!
"In this crystal are the memories of my sisters,
which I stole from the people of Arendelle.
Please return them.
My sisters deserve to be known.
In a cave in the north valley,
you'll find an urn that contains Ingrid.
Please do what I should have done long ago and release her.
When you see her, please tell her
I love her and I'm sorry.
I'd give anything to take back what I did,
to hold her hands one more time."
Ingrid! Let her go!
I understand, aunt Ingrid.
I understand now why you cast this curse.
But you can come back from it.
Understand me?
How could you?
You're nothing like me!
You understand nothing!
You're right.
I'm not like you. My mother wasn't like you.
But if she was able to love you for who you are, so can I.
You're a part of our family no matter what.
And family never gives up on each other.
You lie!
Oh, Gerda.
What have I done?
I need to reverse this.
You can't.
The only way is if you...
I know.
I have to destroy myself.
No, Ingrid. Wait!
There's no other way.
I am a monster,
not because of my powers,
but because of what I let them turn me into.
I have to undo this.
No, Ingrid. You'll die.
I know.
It's okay.
Elsa, Anna,
You found each other.
And, Emma, you found your family,
even if it wasn't with me.
You...
you deserve your memories.
You three are so special.
Never forget that.
There has to be another way.
You deserve your happy ending, too.
Long ago,
a prophecy told me
that you would lead me to just that, Emma.
And this is it.
All I wanted
was to have my sister's love, and...
now I have it.
Now...
I get to join them.
She sacrificed herself for us, for all of us.
Anna.
Elsa.
We must follow through on our mother's last wish.
We must bring back the memory of Ingrid and Helga
to the people of Arendelle.
We will.
Get off me!
Don't you sneeze on me, you son of a gun!
What am I wearing?
Sorry I tried to kill you.
With a crossbow.
Yeah. You tried to kill me with a crossbow.
Emma!
Mom!
Henry.
And mom.
And he's finally waking.
Look, I know that we were under the Snow Queen's curse, but --
We were under a curse.
It's okay.
Henry got away.
So you failed.
At kidnapping a child.
Well, perhaps you could say my heart wasn't in it.
The Snow Queen's plan also failed.
But mine won't.
Enjoy this snowfall, dearie.
It'll be your last.
Then grant me one dying wish.
I'm not in the business of making deals with you anymore.
Leave Emma and the rest of Storybrooke be.
There's no need to harm them.
When I step over that town line with my magic intact,
Emma and Storybrooke have nothing to fear from me...
as long as they don't get in my way.
But I can't make that same promise
for the rest of the world.
