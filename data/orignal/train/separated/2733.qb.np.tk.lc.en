but food may not be the answer to every problem .
neither is acting like a whiny bitch .
tony .

my shitty @-@ ass pizza job .

but why &apos;s he gotta take it out on us ?

hey , tony . what &apos;s the good word ?
can &apos;t complain .
sure you could . phil leotardo .
my first assignment out of the academy was in brooklyn .
never cared for him .
he tried to set up this other rookie , female , for rape and beating .
listen , that subject we talked about ...
if i was to know
something possibly terror @-@ related
and help you out ,
could i bank the resulting goodwill ?
well ,
what happens is
i would personally write you what &apos;s called a 5k letter .
it &apos;s a document setting forth your cooperation and service
this letter would be placed in your file
and if you were ever convicted of a crime
it &apos;d be presented to a judge
when he or she
would be considering sentencing guidelines .
well , there were a couple of guys ,
i don &apos;t know , arabs , arabians maybe .
they used to hang around the bing
and somebody i knew
may have did some business with them .
at the port ?
you were saying .
they used to be around all the time .
drinking
and trying to tit @-@ fuck the girls , whatever .
and then suddenly they disappeared ,
and i mean completely .
a week or so ago
i &apos;m driving
and i see &apos; em with these other guys .
the headgear and the beard
and the whole fundamental bit .
but there &apos;s nothing illegal there , right ?
what were they doing ?
walking .
but then they meet up with this other group .
i don &apos;t know , it seemed ...
you got a name ?
one was named ahmad
or jamal ...
hold on , hold on .
hey , t.
yeah , i &apos;m here with some people .
the arabs from the bing , what were their names ?
some people ?
exactly .
oh , fuck , yeah . ahmed and mohammed .
what did they do ?
ahmed and mohammed .
you know , actually , i got a cell number .
i called him recently but he don &apos;t answer no more .
ahmed al najafi .
973 @-@ 555 @-@ 01.46 .
ahmed al najafi .
tell me they &apos;re not gonna blow up the chemical plant
or some shit .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ll call you later .
cellphone .
that &apos;s a real prize .
thank you .
so finally i said , &quot; ok ,
as long as you don &apos;t mind yesterday &apos;s pizza . &quot;
&quot; no , no , &quot; he said , &quot; it &apos;s cool . &quot;
&quot; so great , &quot; i told him . &quot; come back tomorrow . &quot;
you are so bad .
hey .
hey , how you doing ?
who &apos;s that ?
i don &apos;t know . some guy .
what are you , going out with him ?
he smiled , anthony .
he works here .
you gotta stop .
or what ?
or i won &apos;t see you again .
like meeting me is such a big deal ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea .
how come ?
cos last time you started crying and had to leave the starbucks .
i can &apos;t sleep at night without you .
lt &apos;ll get better , ok ?
i love you so much .
i gotta go back to work .
stop . you &apos;re embarrassing me .
you knock off early , we go back to your place ,
christen those new sheets you told me about .
a man with a plan , huh ?
the man with the erection .
let me take this .
hey .
it &apos;s me .
i need you to come home . it &apos;s aj .
what happened ?
i am worried , tony .
i have never seen him like this .
i &apos;m supposed to see a new property
but i am afraid to leave him alone .
afraid , why ?
will you just come home , please ?
go away .
it &apos;s me .
what &apos;s the matter ?
what happened ?
you know what happened .
blanca still ?
all right , that &apos;s it . enough &apos;s enough .
look , i &apos;m fucking depressed , ok ?
you broke up . how long you want to cry about it ?
she was my life .
you &apos;re 20 years old . you barely have a life .
and you &apos;re better off anyway .
she was cute , ok ,
but come on . with another guy &apos;s kid to boot .
she was the best thing that ever happened to me .
what you &apos;re going through ,
what you &apos;re feeling right now ,
it happens sometimes .
everybody gets the blues .
there &apos;s a half @-@ a @-@ billion @-@ dollar industry devoted to it .
what , prozac ?
no , the music business .
they write thousands of songs about this shit .
tears on my pillow ,
mona lisa , right ?
listen , these fucking women ,
they &apos;ll drive you nuts with your emotions and whatnot .
i know it feels like
you &apos;ll never love anybody again .
but trust me , there &apos;s millions of girls out there
that are dying to meet a guy like you .
i see &apos; em every day .
right , i &apos;m so special .
damn right you are.you &apos;re handsome and smart
and a hard worker
and , let &apos;s be honest , white .
that &apos;s a huge plus nowadays .
go out and get a blow job .
i don &apos;t want a blow job .
keep your voice down .
why ?
who &apos;s listening ?
nobody .
oh , fuck me !
you saw her again , didn &apos;t you ?
i knew it .
i don &apos;t wanna talk about it .
i love you , anthony . it &apos;s killing me to see you like this .
what &apos;s the fucking point ?
point of what ?
just leave me alone .
honestly , i was glad when they broke up .
the culture divide ... but now ...
everything turns to shit .
thank you so much for inviting us .
i &apos;m so nervous cooking for all these people .
do you remember tony &apos;s sister barbara ?
of course .
hi .
her husband tom , stefan , alyssa .
this is for you .
thank you .
and the baby .

how you holding up ?
i &apos;m freaking .
i gotta take the ziti out .

yeah .
so it could be good . got a lot of money in this .
look at that wrist action .
all those years yanking
it finally starting to pay off .
that non @-@ alcoholic shit any good ?
it &apos;s all right .
less filling , tastes like ass .
this is nice .
about time you invited everybody over .
it was kelli &apos;s idea .
she &apos;s been wanting to start entertaining .
good thing , else i &apos;d never see you .
what are you talking about ?
steak &apos;s done .
you think so ?
it keeps cooking even if it &apos;s off the flame .
the juices .
so what &apos;s up with you ?
you &apos;ve been like a ghost lately .
you &apos;re around , then you &apos;re gone .
i was by the bing the other day .
for five minutes .
you know , you of all people should understand how hard it is
for me to be around that place .
i should ? why ?
cos you &apos;re in therapy .
you understand the human condition , at least .
still doing that ?
turn those ribs .
between the booze and the strippers over there ,
half of them are fucking cokeheads .
it &apos;s hard , you know ?
and satriale &apos;s , that fridge full of beer .
it &apos;s tough to eat a sausage and peppers
without a cold one .
so then just quit . you want a beer , too bad .
show some balls .
i got balls .
i can &apos;t eat eggplant cos of my stomach .
might put me into a relapse .
now , believe me , i &apos;d like to , but i don &apos;t .
it &apos;s not that simple .
make it simple .
it &apos;s a disease .
i inherited it . you know the problem with my mother .
i gotta be honest . this whole disease concept ,
i think it &apos;s bullshit .
so you know more than the scientists ?
i know a crutch when i see it .
so my dad ?
you must have knew he had a crutch .
what the fuck are you talking about ? - come on , tone .
between the coke , the vodka ,
whatever else he was squirting up his arm ...
let &apos;s be honest about the great dickie moltisanti .
my dad , your hero ...
wasn &apos;t much more than a fucking junkie .
hey , don &apos;t fucking move !
easy .
what the fuck is going on ?
paulie , remember ? germani .
we met at your granddaughter &apos;s christening .
what the fuck are you doing ?
my uncle didn &apos;t call you ?
no ...
who &apos;s your uncle ?
paulie gaultieri .
these are for his friend at the union .
what union ?
he was supposed to call you . you believe this ?
al , this is a big fucking mix @-@ up .
i thought paulie called you .
the guy &apos;s waiting .
so you break in ?
i got a silent alarm that goes to my house .
he &apos;ll take care of you .
let me talk to my son @-@ in @-@ law .

if dale calls , just tell him i &apos;m sorry .
but you &apos;re the manager .
tone , hey .
hey .
how you doing ?
this always helps .
god bless the nfl .
i tell you , i owe a spot of it to my son .
i was against this kid even going to college .
once him and carlo &apos;s kid started taking action on campus ,
far as i &apos;m concerned , he should stay till he gets a phd .
benefits of a higher education .
don &apos;t get me wrong . he &apos;s learning stuff too .
the shit this kid knows about computers ...
he set his mother up with a website
for her ceramics business .
you must be very proud .
believe me , i thank god every day .
i gotta take a leak .
parisi the younger . i was just talking to your dad about you .
what did i do now ?
to hear him , you &apos;re the golden boy .
hey , tone .
what the fuck &apos;s with you ?
root canal . they got me on oxycodone .
my whole fucking head is numb .
that answers a lot of questions .
what the fuck are you laughing at ?
i &apos;ll see you inside , tone . i got something for you .
so how &apos;s rutgers ?
you see those envelopes ?
majoring in cash , minoring in ass .
things change , huh ?
when i was in college , it wasn &apos;t so much sports betting .
hey , how &apos;s aj doing ?
good .
he &apos;s working . broke up with that girlfriend of his .
that spanish chick ?
he took her to my cousin &apos;s wedding .
she was smoking , that girl .
yeah , you know , whatever .
he didn &apos;t want to get too serious .
fuck , jay , check it out
holy shit .
so sil tells me
you booked a party here next week .
yeah , it &apos;s our frat .
you should call aj .
he &apos;s probably busy but he &apos;d love to see you guys .
absolutely .
definitely .
who is it ?
me .
how you doing , kid ?
what the fuck , paulie ?
i left you four messages .
my flight was delayed . i just got in .
and i &apos;ve been dealing with al for two days .
just tell him to relax .
they busted into his store . his acid reflux is acting up .
he woke up kelli , got her all upset .
it &apos;s my fault he &apos;s a crybaby ?
they told him i &apos;d take care of him .
what &apos;s his problem ?
i &apos;m stupid now ?
you know and i know they were there to boost that shit .
it couldn &apos;t wait .
i promised a load to lenny at the joint @-@ fitters &apos; union .
what do i care ? it ain &apos;t my union .
lower your voice . i got neighbours .
fuck them . when you gonna pay me ?
when you suck the money out of my ass . now get the fuck out !
listen , i gotta talk to you .
now ?
it can &apos;t wait , t. this fucking paulie !
what happened ?
he sent his idiot nephew and jason molinaro
to my father @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s store .
they boosted a pallet of power saws .
they did ?
yeah .
not exactly . al caught &apos; em .
so they did or did not take the saws ?
they did under false pretence .
this is what you had to talk to me about ?
they broke into the guy &apos;s store , t !
yeah , i hear you . i get it .
but we &apos;re talking about
a potentially multimillion @-@ dollar proposition here
it ain &apos;t the money , tone .
really ? well , i &apos;m glad you feel that way .
a pallet of drills . you believe this shit ?
go have a lime rickey or whatever you &apos;re drinking these days ,
and we &apos;ll be done in a minute .
forget it , all right ? i got other shit to do .
come in .
i need to talk to you guys .
what &apos;s the matter ? finn ?
what ? no .
it &apos;s not about me . aj .
i know he &apos;s upset ,
but he &apos;s been saying some things that are really disturbing .
like what ?
like nobody gives a shit about him .
what &apos;s the point of anything ? stuff like that .
i told you about
that girl hadley in my dorm sophomore year ,
the one who threw herself off the library balcony .
these are the kind of things she was saying .
i don &apos;t mean to get you all upset ...
of course not . i &apos;m glad you said something .
good night .
good night , sweetie .
get some sleep .
i came here today to tell you
in all seriousness that i &apos;m done .
i did what you said .
i gave it a lot of thought
and i decided that , once and for all ,
it &apos;s over .
the truth is ,
this therapy is a jerk @-@ off .
you know it and i know it .
i actually don &apos;t know it ,
but please continue .
it &apos;s a jerk @-@ off .
yes , you &apos;ve said that .
i was coming here to quit .
had it all planned out . but guess what .
my son is talking suicide .
so now i &apos;m trapped here forever .
my god , what did he say ?
his girlfriend , fiance , whatever ,
she broke up with him .
he &apos;s beyond devastated .
shall i recommend someone for him to talk to ?
carmela &apos;s getting a referral from his own paediatrician .
after that incompetent
you sent meadow to ?
so i suppose now comes the grilling
about how i feel about all this .
isn &apos;t that why you &apos;re here ?
friends of mine , they got sons his age
and they &apos;re happy ,
ambitious .
they fucking take life as it comes .
i know it seems that way ,
but do you really know these other boys ?
i know what i see ,
my son curled up on the couch
when he should be banging coeds .
have you talked to him ?
till i &apos;m blue in the face .
we both have , and now we &apos;re afraid to talk to him
because of what he might do .
obviously i &apos;m prone to depression ,
a certain bleak attitude about the world ,
but i know i can handle it .
your kids , though ,
it &apos;s like when they &apos;re little
and they get sick ,
you &apos;d give anything to trade places with them
so they don &apos;t have to suffer .
and then to think you &apos;re the cause of it .
how are you the cause of it ?
it &apos;s in his blood , this miserable fucking existence .
my rotten fucking putrid genes
have infected my kid &apos;s soul .
that &apos;s my gift to my son .
i know this is difficult .
but i &apos;m very glad we &apos;re having this discussion .
really ?
cos i gotta be honest . i think it fucking sucks .
what does ?
therapy , this .
i hate this fucking shit !
we &apos;re both adults here , right ?
so after all is said
and done ,
after all the complaining and the crying
and all the fucking bullshit ,
is this all there is ?
yes . welcome .
hi , i &apos;m chris . i &apos;m an alcoholic and drug addict .
hi , chris .
i want to go back to what stan said .
how not being able to socialise is hard
when you &apos;re a salesman .
in my case , it &apos;s the same thing .
it &apos;s actually taking food out of my daughter &apos;s mouth .
my boss , for all his bullshit encouragement ,
how he respects what i &apos;m doing ,
the reality is he resents my sobriety .
i had the same thing at unicor .
they were all on board for the intervention
but skip one golf outing and you &apos;re ostracised .
he &apos;s an enabler too , the worst fucking kind .
pours you a drink with one hand ,
judges you with the other if you take it .
and he wonders why i &apos;m distant ,
why i wanna branch out into other things .
but i can promise you i &apos;d have more money ,
plus more responsibility ,
if i sat with him drinking ,
watching that scotch
drool out of his fat fucking mouth .
hey .
what are you watching ?
nothing .
that &apos;s a good one .
john wayne .
two jasons call you ?
invite you to a party tomorrow night ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , either they did or they didn &apos;t .
yeah , i guess .
jason gervasi called .
what did you tell him ?
i didn &apos;t call him back .
how come ?
cos i don &apos;t want to go .
of course not . beer , strippers ,
fucking around with guys your own age ,
you hate that shit .
you gonna call him ?
i said i don &apos;t want to go .
i know you don &apos;t want to go .
you don &apos;t want to work , you don &apos;t want to eat ,
you don &apos;t want to talk either .
so , all that being the case ,
you &apos;re gonna shower tomorrow night ,
you &apos;re gonna get dressed , you &apos;re gonna go to that party .
i &apos;m not gonna debate you on this .
fine .
your boss is your uncle ?
once removed .
that &apos;s gotta add to the source .
we used to be so tight .
and producing movies is high @-@ stress enough .
i have a happy marriage .
but there was a woman ...
she worked with us in a club we had .
anyway , she became a problem to deal with
and
i sided with him .
she was out of my life .
ok , fine .
but he never appreciated it .
give , give , give , it &apos;s all i ever do .
i think that &apos;s when the relationship between me and him
got poisoned .
how &apos;s it going ?
al here ?
you just missed him . he went to lunch .
can i help you ?
we &apos;re here for the drills .
what drills ?
you know , in the back .
i know what you mean but al didn &apos;t mention picking anything up .
this fucking guy .
get him on the phone .
all right .
what &apos;s your name ?
me ? i &apos;m mike .
paulie .
nice to meet you .
voicemail .
give me that .
yeah , al , it &apos;s paulie .
listen , we &apos;re here with mike .
we &apos;re taking the drills .
i &apos;ll call you about that other order .
let &apos;s go .
what &apos;s her name ?
blanca .
had you and blanca been engaged long ?
only a couple of weeks .
she had a son too ,
from when she used to be married .
what do you think went wrong ?
her husband was an asshole , supposedly .
with your relationship ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , i wish there was a reason , but
she says there isn &apos;t .
i think maybe it &apos;s because we have way more money in my family than hers .
they &apos;re immigrants ,
and that might have scared her .
have you been feeling suicidal , anthony ?
a little bit .
have you ever tried to kill yourself ?
no .
i mean , once me and my friends
jumped off my garage roof ,
but , you know , that was just to fool around .
you sleeping a lot ?
i &apos;m tired ,
but i keep waking up .
nightmares ?
i just keep thinking about her .
i mean , it hurts ,
but i can &apos;t help it .
does anything in life give you pleasure lately ?
i don &apos;t know .
not really .
there &apos;s a medication called lexapro .
it &apos;s an antidepressant .
i have friends who take that .
well , i &apos;m going to write you a prescription .
i &apos;m making mad fucking money , bro .
i gotta shut my phone off sometimes .
you should totally do it , man .
i &apos;m not really good with betting and percentages .
i got like a 450 on my math sat .
fuck that shit . i could hook you up in ten minutes .
can i dance for you , baby ?
i guess .
yeah , dude !
yeah !
look at this pile of shit .
yeah , so get some toilet paper .
what is that , comedy ?
actually , yeah .
come on , what are you gonna do ?
fuck it , i &apos;m all in .
fucking idiot . toilet paper ?
fucking cunt !
fuck !
chris !
you were my friend .
fuck !
call an ambulance !
tony , wake up . i need to talk to you .
what ?
you let our underage son go to a party at a strip club ?
what time is it ?
take it easy , will you ? what &apos;s the big deal ?
he got in three hours ago .
he is still drunk and he &apos;s not even drinking age .
yet he could die in lraq .
what &apos;s that got to do with anything ?
jesus christ , carm , he &apos;s gonna be 21 in two months .
he &apos;s an emotional wreck , tony .
so seeing a pair of tits is gonna send him over the edge ?
got him out , around people his own age .
at the fucking bing ?
they &apos;re college kids . it &apos;s what they do .
you &apos;d rather see him in his room drinking cocoa
but this is the way back ,
believe me , and the way back to college ,
fraternities , frat boys .
hey .
i did a stupid thing , tone . i won &apos;t deny it .
stupid ? just hung up with paulie .
his nephew &apos;s got six broken vertebraes .
i know that and i &apos;m sorry .
but this is the second fucking time
paulie flouted his authority to my face .
this shit with the tools ,
i know he set up the deal with the cubans ,
but this is my father @-@ in @-@ law we &apos;re talking about , my family .
this bullshit could have been handled with a conversation .
i came to the bing . i tried to talk to you about it .
and i told you to wait and you left
to go god @-@ knows @-@ where .
i got to be honest ,
i can &apos;t help thinking that
this goes directly to what we talked about .
if you were around more ,
problems like this would be squashed in the womb .
whether i &apos;m around &apos;s got nothing to do with it .
he needed the tools , he could have left me a message .
we &apos;re supposed to leave phone messages
about interstate hijacking ?
how about faxes ? emails ?
make it even easier for the cops .
this is a face @-@ to @-@ face business .
i &apos;m gonna talk to paulie
cos there &apos;s a few things that he needs to hear .
you figure out how much he owes for the tools
and we &apos;ll deduct that against what you &apos;ll owe
for little paulie &apos;s hospital bills .
yeah ?
he tore up my lawn , tone ! drove his fucking car right up on the grass .
who did ? - fucking paulie , who else ?
40 grand in landscaping .
terrorised my wife and daughter .
destroyed the bushes ,
the grass and every fucking flower she planted .
just relax , ok ?
i am fucking relaxed .
i &apos;m not gonna do nothing .
because i love you and i &apos;m committed to my work ,
i ain &apos;t gonna do shit .
i &apos;m gonna sit tight and hold my tongue
and not cause problems for you .
bad was &apos; 99 .

is he still sleeping ?
he &apos;s not home .
he stayed with his friends .
he sounded good . they were playing cards .
well , it &apos;s been a week almost , on the meds .
it &apos;s a pleasure not to have him laying around here
like a miserab &apos; .
it &apos;s companies like wal @-@ mart we got to thank .
they fight against tightening imports .
so our provolone , our perfume
slides right under the fucking door .
those inspections slow down wal @-@ mart &apos;s operation .
what about terrorism , missiles and shit ?
there he is , the missing link .
hey .

you &apos;re right .
i just wanted to say i &apos;m sorry .

you know what ? fuck it .
whatever he &apos;s having .
