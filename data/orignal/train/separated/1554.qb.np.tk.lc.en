after talking with lena , we &apos;re not going to ground you .

i don &apos;t want to be some half @-@ assed version of a dad .
brandon has three parents , period .
hey , she said no , man .
thank you .
so you are looking for something permanent for them ?
we want this to be your very last way station

i thought you were just ...
i &apos;ll be really fast ! i promise !

uh , no . it &apos;s ok .
ok .
i just thought you might be sick of wearing the same three things ...
i &apos;m not gonna steal your earrings .
i mean , what am i gonna do ? sell them at school ?
don &apos;t talk about things you don &apos;t understand .
ok . well , what don &apos;t i understand , mariana ?
i mean you stole your brother &apos;s pills , you sold them at school ,
and then you let your brother take the fall for you .
i never asked him to do that .
but you let him .
buddy , can you do that in the bathroom like everybody else , please ?

第一季第三集
she spends like an extra
15 minutes in the shower i &apos;m not even kidding .
it &apos;s like my turn and they ...
sounds like you guys need another bathroom ...
or four less kids .
i just want some privacy , really .
yeah , well i don &apos;t think my parents
are going out of town again any time soon ,
so i &apos;m afraid you missed your chance for privacy , mister .
well , we can figure it out .
how ?
it &apos;s not like we &apos;ll be alone at your place ever again .
poor guy . how long is he in detention for ?
即课后或休息时段面壁思过 不准娱乐活动
all week .
oof . that &apos;s rough .
what do you care ?
i don &apos;t .
i just feel sorry for him . what &apos;s with you ?
nothing , i just ...
look , i feel bad enough about it , ok ?
ok , but you really don &apos;t have to .
think about all the times you covered for him . he &apos;ll be fine .
it &apos;s not like he ever pays attention in class anyway .
look , jude seems like a good kid ...
he is .
but the parent board is all over me on this .
obviously , we &apos;re ok giving you a little leeway ,
but he has to pass the proficiency exam
that the other kids took to get in ,
or i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re going to have to send him somewhere else ...
i can &apos;t send him to another school .
he would be completely lost .
that &apos;s part of the reason he &apos;s so behind right now .
because he hasn &apos;t had anybody to look out for him .
look , i &apos;m not unsympathetic , lena ...
the only sense of security
this kid has in the world is his sister .
separating them would be terrible for him .
look , i &apos;m trying to protect you here , too .
you know how this works .
our funding is based on performance .
and now i have a new seventh grader who jumped the wait list ,
who isn &apos;t operating at even close to grade level .
is it possible we could just give him more time ?
before he has to take the exam , i mean ?
i know if i just had a little while to get him caught up i could ...
lena . he passes the exam on friday ,
or he &apos;s done at anchor beach .
now , he &apos;s guilty , insofar as he did commit the crime ,
but he doesn &apos;t feel that way until he actually gets caught .
ok . i want everyone to
write about guilt in their journals this week .
wait , write ?
like with a pen ? like longhand ?
yes , like longhand .
and don &apos;t worry . no one &apos;s gonna read it .
it &apos;s just for you to get in the habit of writing every day .
ok , guys . seriously , i want you to write about whatever it is
that you feel weird or ashamed or guilty about .
you &apos;ll feel better about it , i promise .
weak , foster . very weak .
and quit &quot; nudging &quot; me online .
hey , meet me tomorrow .
meet you ? why ?
you &apos;re in detention all day , remember ?
i &apos;m gonna have douglas let me go to the bathroom .
so , two o &apos;clock . i &apos;ll meet you by the lifeguard stand .
i don &apos;t know . i have to think about it .
foster !
what ?
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
what are you doing ?
nothing .
talking to lexi . what &apos;s the big deal ?
no classes , no extra @-@ curricular , no fun .
in school detention and home . period .
but we &apos;ve got a game this week .
not my problem .
jesus , you gave away your pills .
do you not understand how serious that is ?
this could have been a lot worse .
use your legs , b. you &apos;re not using your legs .
the twins are both mad because
moms moved callie and jude into their room
and not mine ,
so like everyone &apos;s all ...
everyone &apos;s all tense all the time .
that &apos;s more like it .
nice . you want some water ?
so , i was thinking ,
maybe you might wanna spend some more time at my place ?
maybe even move in with me .
why ?
well , you know i mean , the new kids in the house .
the place is busting at the seams ...
i only get you the one night a week .
you &apos;re going be going off to college before too long ...
and i kinda feel like i &apos;m missing out .
really ?
yeah .
could be fun . why not ?
look , you don &apos;t have to say anything .
just think about it and let me know .
you mind ?
what ?
the song . it &apos;s annoying .
you &apos;re in a good mood tonight ...
i &apos;m always in a good mood .
you &apos;re in a really good mood tonight .
are you ...
is there someone you haven &apos;t told me about ?
what ? no .
really ? nothing &apos;s going on ? nothing at all ?
nothing between you and lexi ?
not at all .
that &apos;s not what it looked like this afternoon .
when ? at volleyball ?
we were just talking .
i was helping her with her kill .
with her kill , really ?
what can i say , i &apos;m irresistible ...
relax . you know i wouldn &apos;t date one of your lame friends anyway .
right ?
so , i won &apos;t be able to go to school with everyone else ?
no , no , no . honey , listen ,
all we need to do is give you the test ,
and once you pass it , everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
if he passes it .
well , yes , but all he needs a 65 or better ,
and we &apos;re good to go .
you can do that , right ?
this isn &apos;t fair .
no , it &apos;s not . but this is what i want to suggest ,
jude , you and i are going to spend this week getting you ready ,
and that way you will ace it for sure .
deal ?
ok , remember to convert to a fraction first . good .
hey , b.
how were the batting cages ?
oh , uh , good , you know .
yeah ? what &apos;s up ?
uh , bud ? i think we got some good work done tonight .
so , why don &apos;t you run upstairs and get ready for bed . good .
night , bud .
night , jude .
we &apos;ll be up in a minute .
what &apos;s up , babe ?
uh , dad kinda ...
asked me to move in with him today .
well , he never mentioned anything to me .
and i really think that he should have talked to me first .
yeah . i guess .
um . all right , well ... don &apos;t worry about it . i &apos;ll talk to him .
yeah , ok ...
i said , i &apos;d think about it .
well , there &apos;s really nothing to think about .
i mean , it &apos;s not your choice .
it &apos;s not really your father &apos;s either , for that matter .
what do you mean , i don &apos;t get a choice ? why not ?
because you &apos;re , um ...
you &apos;re still a kid .
i &apos;m 16 .
yes , that &apos;s exactly my point .
you &apos;re 16 , you &apos;re not an adult yet .
this is bull .
i &apos;m sorry ?
this is bull . i should get a say in this .
well , you don &apos;t .
and we are done talking about this .
oh , right . ok , we &apos;re done talking about this .
yeah , &apos; cause that &apos;s , that &apos;s your answer for everything .
ok , let &apos;s just take a deep breath ...
right , b. because you &apos;re a prisoner being held captive
in this charming craftsman in mission bay .
stef ...
what ?
when did i ever get to choose anything ?
did i get to choose for you to divorce dad ?
did i get to choose who i was gonna live with ?
you were five ! come on .
how about choosing if i have two moms ...
did i get to choose that ?
that &apos;s enough , brandon .
why ? because i &apos;m not doing exactly what you want me to do ?
no , because you &apos;re being disrespectful .
oh , i &apos;m being disrespectful ?
how about you have a little respect for someone else !
you need to stop talking right now .
right , of course i do ! because that &apos;s your answer .
anytime anyone disagrees with you , it &apos;s stop talking !
be quiet ! do it my way !
you need to watch yourself , young man .
watch this , mom .
brandon !
if you leave this house .
stef . stef ! let him go .
he needs to cool down .
and so do you ...
are you gonna be up much longer ?
i can &apos;t sleep with the light on .
i &apos;m not just some selfish bitch , you know ...
ok .
i didn &apos;t sell the pills for me .
it &apos;s not like i bought a new dress or something .
then why &apos;d you do it ?
for my birth mom .
did you hear me ?
i &apos;m listening .
where were you ?
i went to aiden &apos;s .
you don &apos;t do that . you don &apos;t walk away .
i know , i know . i was just ... i &apos;m sorry .
i know . i &apos;m sorry , too ...
for raising my voice . but that can &apos;t ever happen again .
you can get mad at me all you want to ,
but you are not allowed to walk away .
it won &apos;t happen again . i promise .
ok .
and , and ... for the record ,
i ... i love having two moms .
that &apos;s good .
um , you really made your point , brandon .
i spoke with lena and it &apos;s up to you ...
where you want to live .
you can stay here , or you can move in with your dad .
it &apos;s your choice . just let us know what you decide .
well , don &apos;t stay up too long . &apos; cause it &apos;s late , ok ?
ok .
all right , love .
you &apos;re back . that was some fight , man .
you heard that ?
we all did . so what happened ?
they &apos;re letting me decide .
really ? wow .
i mean , moms are gonna be devastated if you go .
and my dad will be devastated if i don &apos;t go .
you wanted to choose .
good luck with that .
i just think , i mean , we &apos;re gonna get a lot more time alone .
i just hope my moms don &apos;t get too upset .
brandon , they &apos;ll be fine .
really . you can go visit them , you know , whenever ...
with all those kids in the house
i doubt they &apos;ll even notice .
very good .
i thought you &apos;d have a lot of guilt .
good . very nice .
lose your pen ? ok .
nice . good .
good .
i see some of us are still wanting for inspiration .
tell you what ,
why don &apos;t you and wyatt come see me after school today and
we can see if we can get those juices flowing .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
you &apos;re incorrigible .
look it up .
every single one of you should know what that means .
ok , turn to page 45 .
so , we gonna talk about the elephant in the car or what ?
not much to say .
you wanted brandon to have a choice . he does .
you could &apos;ve told him no .
i tried . it didn &apos;t go well .
hey , can i have a breakfast burrito , extra salsa , please ?
you got it .
thank you .
so what , you just gonna be mad at me ?
i don &apos;t know , mike .
do i wish you had talked to me about it first ?
sure .
would i have agreed to let b decide ?
probably not .
so , maybe this is for the best .
but i &apos;ll tell you what you
blind @-@ side me with something like this again
i &apos;m gonna bury you deep in the desert .
fair enough .
sucks being blind @-@ sided , don &apos;t it ?
so , all of this with brandon is just payback ?
for what ? figuring out i was gay and leaving ?
it &apos;s a little late for payback , stef .
i think so . mike , come on .
if you &apos;re gonna rehash our marriage for ten hours a day ,
i &apos;m going to ask roberts for another partner . seriously .
stef , it &apos;s not payback ...
it &apos;s regret . it &apos;s me growin &apos; up .
i got a kid who &apos;s going off on his own .
i &apos;m just trying to do something right .
so , talya told me the news ...
you &apos;re moving in with your dad ?
yeah .
um , it &apos;s not ...
this might be stupid ,
but it &apos;s not because of me and jude , is it ?
no . no , no , not at all .
just &apos; cause i mean , from what i can tell ,
you seem pretty happy in the house .
yeah .
hot water not withstanding .
i am , i am . i mean , it &apos;s my house .
it &apos;s where i grew up .
so , why are you leaving ?
shouldn &apos;t you be in class right now ?
we are . drama .
leslie wanted to make sure the posters went up today , so ...
how &apos;d you get out of iss ?
oh , told douglas that i had to take a leak .
i should probably get back .
listen ...
yeah ?
thank you so much , for what you did .
telling moms all that . you didn &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s cool .
i just wanted to let you know how much i appreciate it .
you really are the best brother ...
foster ! foster . hey !
so , what happened ?
douglas wouldn &apos;t even let you out to use the bathroom ?
well , then what ? i was sitting there for like half @-@ an @-@ hour .
i &apos;m sorry &apos; bout that .
&quot; sorry &apos; bout that ? &quot;
that &apos;s it ?
i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t think this is a good idea .
why not ?
you know why ...
&apos;cause of mariana ?
do you honestly think that she &apos;s gonna care ?
i know she is . she told me .
her brother and her best friend like each other , so ?
most people would see that as a good thing .
yeah , well , she doesn &apos;t .
we &apos;re just gonna do whatever mariana wants ?
try using those to write with .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s gonna happen , timothy .
maybe we &apos;re just not writers .
have you ever heard of joan didion ? no ?
she &apos;s a writer . tough lady . kind of a pill .
she called writing , &quot; a hostile act . &quot;
a way of &quot; imposing your will on the world . &quot;
now , i don &apos;t mean to point fingers , but ...
two of the three people in this room seem a little hostile .
to me , anyway .
the thing is , that sort of writing takes real courage .
and you don &apos;t strike me as someone who is afraid of much ...
come on . come on . one line .
one thing that &apos;s been rattling around in your head forever .
one thing you feel terrible about .
get it out . get it down on paper .
and see what happens .
hey , bud .
hey . ready .
where we going ? the grill ?
no , my place . i thought i &apos;d cook something tonight .
seriously ?
yeah , seriously . it &apos;s not like i never cooked before .
unless it &apos;s pasta ? b , i &apos;d be very careful .
seriously , he cooked me a piece of fish once in 1997,
i can still taste it .
i &apos;ll have him back by nine .
i know .
i &apos;m gonna get a snack . do you want anything ?
oh , hey don &apos;t do that .
uh , we &apos;ll eat in front of the tv .
i finally got the surround sound hooked up .
ok .
oh and hey ... you know , if you move in ,
we could move that table out of the way ,
and you could put your keyboard and stuff there .
yeah , yeah , that would be ... that &apos;s cool .
yeah , i mean , you know if ...
right , yeah , of course .
no pressure .
yeah .
hey what &apos;s ... what &apos;s this ?
oh , that ? you like it ? i made it .
you made it ?
yeah .
that &apos;s the ship i was on when i was in the navy .
yeah , i remember the name but ...
you made this ?
good job , dad .
remember , this is half base times height .
i keep forgetting the formulas .
maybe i &apos;m just not smart enough .
oh , honey . you are plenty smart .
and trust me , i know smart .
considering you went to , what ?
six different schools in the past four years ,
you &apos;re doing really great ...
seven .
seven different schools .
so , you still playing poker ?
uh , no .
how come ? i mean i remember you used to brag all the time
about milking those guys for beer money ...
ah , you know ...
you do something for a while , people get busy then ...
i don &apos;t know . you just let it go .
too bad .
it happens , kid ..
i gotta get you home .
i mean , i can text mom .
so , we can finish the movie .
yeah ?
yeah .
ok .
hey , i got an idea . let &apos;s play a game .
why don &apos;t you run up and grab everybody
and get something out of the game closet ?
hey , talya . come on in .
uh , brandon &apos;s not here , though .
tonight &apos;s the night he has dinner with his dad , remember ?
oh , shoot . i forgot .
that &apos;s ok . you &apos;re welcome
to wait if you want . he should be here soon .
and we &apos;re just about to play a game , if you &apos;d like to join .
yeah , sure .
ok .
why don &apos;t you throw that stuff in brandon &apos;s room .
hey , callie !
we &apos;re playing a game ?
yes , we are playing a game .
all of us ?
yes , all of us .
we used to do this all the time , remember ?
we just got out of the habit ,
and i think now that callie and jude are here ,
it would be fun to start the tradition again .
i &apos;m sorry , did somebody say , &quot; game ? &quot;
really ?
you better get ready to lose , lady .
she always loses .
see ? fun .
fun ! fun for everyone .
they &apos;re so much fun . i &apos;m really gonna miss hanging out here .
you know , now that brandon &apos;s moving in with his dad .
um , have you talked to him lately ?
&apos;cause i just don &apos;t think that &apos;s happening .
a boomerang ?
a boomerang ...
really , a boomerang ?
a weapon of some sort .
hey , bud .
it &apos;s not a boomerang . it &apos;s a cannon .
we just started , we saved room for you .
you can be the top hat .
so ...
i think i &apos;m gonna move in with my dad .
ok . cool .
all right . um , before we get started ,
uh , does anybody want anything ?
i &apos;m gonna get some tea . do you want anything ?
ok .
so , you &apos;re really leaving , huh ?
yeah .
hey , uh , thanks for letting me use this .
what are you doing ?
that wasn &apos;t a loaner .
really ?
yeah , no . it &apos;s for you .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
you don &apos;t have to say anything .
just make sure you play it .
so , i guess you decided you need more hot water , huh ?
yeah .
well , thanks .
yeah . no worries .
so , i &apos;m gonna move the bed to that wall .
get like a couch in here or something .
just , really make this place a serious bachelor pad .
settle down . this is still my room .
what am i gonna do without you here , man ?
it &apos;s just gonna be me and a bunch of girls .
and jude .
yeah . and jude .
you &apos;ll be fine . just stay out of trouble .
yes , you . stop giving out all your pills
to every cute girl in school , for one thing .
it wasn &apos;t me .
what ?
it was mariana .
you &apos;re joking , right ?
she wanted to have some money to give to our birth mom .
what the hell , man . what are you doing ?
why would she do that ? and why would you take the blame for her ?
mariana asked me to go with her to tell moms what she did .
she was just about to say something .
i looked over at her face ,
just at her stupid , scared face .
it looked just like it did
when we moved into our first foster house .
and i couldn &apos;t let her do it .
i mean , everyone &apos;s always mad at me all the time anyway .
so , i figured , what does it matter ?
but at least it &apos;s over .
all of this being grounded , and in @-@ school suspension ...
it was totally worth it ,
now that she knows what a loser our birth mom is .
i mean , you know some day
you &apos;re gonna have to let mariana fend for herself .
i never touched it !
why would you do that ?
good luck with those two .
it was moved !
no one else has even been in here !
i never touched it !
hey ! enough shouting !
what is going on ?
she read my journal .
no , i didn &apos;t .
well , somebody did . i left it right here
second from the bottom and when i came back , it was moved .
well , it wasn &apos;t me .
mariana , tell me the truth ...
i am ! i never touched it .
ok , callie , is it possible that
it wasn &apos;t really moved ? that you just think it was ?
why ? because perfect mariana could never do anything wrong ?
yeah , maybe you should get to know your daughter a bit better .
wait , what does that mean ?
you know what ? forget it . don &apos;t worry about it .
you &apos;re probably right . it was probably my fault .
i just forgot or something , probably .
i can &apos;t live with her .
well , you have to . so , figure it out .
why &apos;d you have to get so mad ?
why can &apos;t you just get along with her ?
she read my journal .
what do you care ?
it &apos;s just a stupid journal .
see for yourself .
you wrote about liam ?
很高兴得知你想见我 我们可以找时间一起吃顿晚饭
he said he wants a hostile act ...
time &apos;s up , jude . you all done ?
i &apos;ll correct it , and i &apos;ll let you know .

for someone your age , b.

that &apos;s the way it works .
you don &apos;t , have to take care of me or your dad or lena .
it &apos;s the other way around .
i didn &apos;t read your journal .
i know you don &apos;t believe me , and that &apos;s fine .
i mean , why should you ?
i &apos;m just the latest girl you &apos;ve been forced to share a room with .
i remember what that was like .
being passed around all the time .
i don &apos;t think i ever felt safe until i got here .
it took me a long time to trust anybody .
so , i get it .
but i didn &apos;t read your journal .
yeah , comin &apos; !
