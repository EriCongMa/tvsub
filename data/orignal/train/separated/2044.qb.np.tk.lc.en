i just wanted to tell you
that i appreciate you patching things up with him .
i would do anything for the woman that i love ...
they are gonna come at us any way they can ,
and when they do ,
it &apos;s not gonna be about heat sensors ,
it &apos;s gonna be about you .
i know i &apos;m not the only guy in that company
that knows those sensors are faulty .
i &apos;m sorry . what is it you need again ?
all the maintenance work orders from the past six months .
i can &apos;t let you have that without authorization .
have you heard of the national transportation safety board ?
that &apos;s your secretary unlawfully gathering evidence ,
which means there will be no settlement of any kind .
and tomorrow , i &apos;m sending this to the district attorney .
your whole story
about how louis got his name on the door is bullshit .
jeff .
it &apos;s over , jessica .
we &apos;re done .
i can &apos;t believe you actually got them to admit what they did .
you better believe it , because it &apos;s happening ,
and it wouldn &apos;t be happening without you .
you mean without me being greedy .
joe , that &apos;s not what i was gonna say .
no , no , no , i know that you don &apos;t think
i care about these people , but i do .
but i &apos;m also a working stiff .
i go paycheck to paycheck for my whole life ,
and then a thing like this--
could turn your whole life around .
guy like you might not be able to understand that .
i understand .
so it &apos;s a done deal ?
might take a few days to finalize ,
but yeah .
it &apos;s happening .
you have my word .
you &apos;re all right , mr. ross .
harvey , you know the only times you &apos;ve been here at night
were the god @-@ awful dinner party--
and the other time .
well , this isn &apos;t that .
i want to know why liberty rail
has a video of you in their file room .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking the fact that our smoking gun
just became inadmissible .
harvey--
how &apos;d you get those documents ?
are you asking if i did something illegal ?
because i didn &apos;t .
well , they went to the d.a. ,
which means they think you did ,
so i &apos;m gonna ask you one more time ,
how did you get in their file room ?
by walking through the door they buzzed open .
and why would they do that ?
because i &apos;m me .
what the hell does that mean ?
it means that i led the woman to believe
that i was an official from washington .
led them to believe it ,
or flat out told them ?
because one kills our case
and the other puts you in a world of shit .
harvey , i &apos;m not an idiot ,
and i don &apos;t appreciate being treated like one .
i told you i didn &apos;t do anything illegal , and i didn &apos;t .
not an idiot ?
what the hell were you doing there in the first place ?
harvey .
it was mike &apos;s idea , wasn &apos;t it ?
no , he didn &apos;t even know about it .
where are you going ?
to see mike .
i told you , he didn &apos;t even know i was going to do it .
i don &apos;t care , because he sure as hell knew after .
let &apos;s go .
i am so proud of you .
i &apos;ve done that before .
i &apos;m not talking about that .
i &apos;m talking about your case .
you believed in it , and you fought for it ,
and i-- i love that about you .
and i love that you love that about me .
when a person gives you a compliment like that ,
you &apos;re supposed to give one back .
but i just did .
i said that you love that i love that about me .
and what if i said i love that
you love that i love that about you ?
how would that make you feel ?
so tired .
well , we both know why you &apos;re so tired .
yeah , because i &apos;m so good .
don &apos;t you love that about me ?
you knew donna bullshitted her way into that company
and you let us use those work orders ?
how did you find out ?
it doesn &apos;t matter how i found out .
answer my question .
yes , i knew , but what difference does it make ? we won .
we didn &apos;t win ,
because evan smith has video of donna in their offices .
what ?
she know about this too ?
harvey , she &apos;s just trying to strong @-@ arm us .
are you listening to me ?
they have the opposing counsel &apos;s secretary
poking around in their goddamn file room .
if i were the d.a. , i &apos;d sure as hell look into it .
the d.a. ?
yeah , the d.a.
harvey , they let her in .
according to you , but they &apos;re gonna claim fraud
or theft or any number of things .
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m making a deal to drop this case ,
that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do ,
and you &apos;re gonna file the paperwork as soon as i do .
so you &apos;re just gonna let this woman
blackmail you without a fight ?
you &apos;re damn right i am .
harvey , we can still win this case and clear--
there is no case ,
and i wouldn &apos;t give a shit about it if there was .
i care about donna .
and you think i don &apos;t ?
you care so much for her ?
then draw up those papers ,
because i &apos;m letting evan know it &apos;s over .
what are you doing here ?
we have a situation .
is the fate of the firm hanging in the balance ?
no--
then i don &apos;t give a shit .
you told malone , didn &apos;t you ?
i didn &apos;t get a chance to tell him ,
because he had already figured out
that i had been lying to him this whole time .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , you &apos;re sorry .
this morning i thought i was going away with him for two weeks .
now i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m ever gonna see him again .
he quit ?
he didn &apos;t get around to giving me his career plans .
you want me to talk to him for you ?
no , this is my mess .
and i will take care of it myself .
you can take care of it tomorrow .
right now , i &apos;m making you a drink .
zipadeedoodah or grab my sack ?
what ?
messenger service .
which one do we use ?
i @-@ i--
you know what ?
use whoever you want . just take care of it .
louis , don &apos;t you have your own secretary ?
oh , you mean norma , who i can &apos;t find anywhere ,
who is probably taking the day off again ?
last year , she tried to get arbor day off ,
and i told her to blow a goddamn tree
and get her ass in here .
you know what , louis ?
norma has taken 4 days off in the last 36 years .
why don &apos;t you back the hell off of her .
what the hell is the matter with you ?
you usually jump on the norma bashing train
like a hobo in a 1940s action movie .
i &apos;m sorry , i just ...
what ?
i bullshitted my way into liberty rail
to get some documents .
they caught me on video ,
and now they &apos;re threatening to press charges .
you &apos;re not saying anything .
it &apos;s nothing . it &apos;s fine .
then why did you look so concerned ?
i was concerned , but they &apos;re threatening charges ,
which means they want something ,
and i know harvey , and whatever it is they want ,
he &apos;ll find a way to give it to him .
okay .
thanks , louis .
i &apos;ll take care of your stuff .
no , no . you have enough on your mind .
i &apos;ll take care of it myself .
mr. specter , don &apos;t tell me .
you &apos;re here to talk about ms. paulsen .
i &apos;m here to tell you you made your point .
and what point is that ?
if you drop any charges against donna ,
we &apos;ll drop the lawsuit against you .
well , that &apos;s not a very even trade .
i &apos;m giving your client the chance to get away with murder .
last i checked ,
my client wasn &apos;t being charged with murder ,
and i don &apos;t need you to drop your suit ,
because you have no case .
no case ?
your client put a faulty train on those tracks ,
people died , and they knew it could happen the whole time .
and you have no proof .
and where i come from ,
you cut a deal with me to make sure i stop looking .
then i guess we come from different places ,
because i didn &apos;t give that video to the district attorney
to leverage you into a deal .
i did it to blow you out of the water .
this is a person &apos;s life .
maybe you should have thought of that
before you sent her to rob my client .
evan , i care about this woman .
look , i understand .
she &apos;s probably worked for you for a long time .
maybe you sleep together once in a while .
but my job is to defend my client
to the best of my abilities ,
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m going to do .
holy shit .
you can &apos;t possiblely have a check already .
i don &apos;t have a check , joe .
we have to drop the case .
what the hell are you talking about ?
we had drinks last night .
yeah , we also had proof last night ,
and now we don &apos;t .
why not ?
it &apos;s complicated .
you know , it &apos;s a lot of legal rigmarole ...
hey , don &apos;t talk down to me .
i &apos;m not talking down to you .
but i &apos;m also not gonna stand here
and explain civil procedure .
maybe i don &apos;t understand civil procedure ,
but i know enough to understand
when something doesn &apos;t add up .
we got the evidence the wrong way .
well , get it the right way .
subpoena it or something .
i can &apos;t .
what do you mean , you can &apos;t ?
that money was gonna change my life .
and if you want to go to a different law firm ,
i understand .
you know as well as i do
nobody else is gonna take this case .
you told me you cared about these people .
you gave me your word .
yeah , and i wish i could keep it .
i want those bastards as much as you want this money ,
but i &apos;ve got no proof ,
and you &apos;re not a credible witness .
oh , that bullshit again .
that &apos;s not bullshit .
if you had been straight with me from day one ,
we wouldn &apos;t even be in this mess .
how much did they give you to dump the case ?
had to be something .
otherwise , you wouldn &apos;t sell me out .
i &apos;m sorry , joe . it &apos;s over .
you &apos;re sorry ?
jessica .
do you need something ?
i came by earlier , and you weren &apos;t in .
i had a meeting , and i really didn &apos;t think
you wanted to be looped in on my schedule .
i don &apos;t , and i &apos;m not checking up on you .
i just didn &apos;t know if you were coming in .
you mean you weren &apos;t sure if i was ever coming in again .
you wouldn &apos;t be the first person to leave a job
for personal reasons .
it sounds to me like you have an agenda .
i don &apos;t .
well , that &apos;s a first .
are you saying that i came here to push you out ?
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;ve never known you
not to know what you want .
what i want is to talk about us ,
but you don &apos;t seem to want to do that ,
so i &apos;m focusing on this .
i &apos;m not resigning my senior partnership
the day after what happened happened ,
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re asking .
i &apos;m asking if you plan to resign it at all .
and i can &apos;t tell you that right now , because i don &apos;t know .
well , when will you know ?
look , jessica , you &apos;re the managing partner ,
so if you want to push me out , push me out ,
but if you &apos;re asking me what i want to do ,
i &apos;m telling you that i haven &apos;t decided .
how did it go ?
never mind how it went .
where &apos;s mike . did he file those papers ?
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s not even in yet .
well , you tell him not to file anything ,
and you tell him to do whatever he has to
stick it to that woman .
why ?
because it didn &apos;t work .
what didn &apos;t work ?
i tried to make a deal with evan to trade the case .
you mean you offered to drop the case in exchange for me .
yes .
and now what are we gonna do ?
you &apos;re not gonna do anything .
i &apos;m gonna do whatever i have to
to get terrance wolf to back off .
harvey , there &apos;s no way the d.a.
handles a case like this himself
just because i work for you .
whether he handles it himself or not doesn &apos;t matter ,
because this case won &apos;t even exist in another hour .
how did it go ?
i just told a man that everything
i promised him was bullshit .
how do you think it went ?
mike , i &apos;m sorry .
oh , you should have seen his face .
that money was gonna change his life ,
and then i dangled it in front of him and ripped it away .
yeah , but it &apos;s not your fault .
you did everything you could .
he accused me of selling out .
you know you didn &apos;t do that .
didn &apos;t i ?
we gave up because--
of me ?
that &apos;s not what i was gonna say .
yeah , it was .
no , i was gonna say because of harvey .
what are you talking about ?
harvey never wanted to take this case ,
so he put a clock on it to get me to drop it .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re where we are right now .
listen to me ; harvey is out there right now
busting his ass to fix everything .
no , donna .
he doesn &apos;t give a shit about this case , and he never did .
then why did he send me here to tell you to do
everything you can to stick it to evan smith ?
she didn &apos;t take the deal , did she ?
no , she didn &apos;t .
donna , i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t realize that you were still--
on the hot seat ?
like i said , harvey &apos;s busting his ass to fix it ,
which means he &apos;s gonna fix it .
now , finish what we started
and figure out a way to win this case .
harvey specter .
i was wondering when you would show up .
that &apos;s funny ; i was wondering why
you never sent me a christmas card .
you don &apos;t seem the least bit worried about
the pending charges against your secretary .
i &apos;m not , because she did nothing wrong .
well , you know what i think ?
i think you wouldn &apos;t be here if she did nothing wrong .
listen to me . she didn &apos;t steal anything .
she got those documents by convincing them to let her in ,
and that is not a crime .
and the last time you were in my office ,
you told me you hadn &apos;t committed a crime
to get the job done .
after i told you you had an innocent man ,
and all you cared about was procedure .
all i cared about was the law .
well , if you &apos;re so concerned with people breaking the law ,
why don &apos;t you take a look at those documents ?
because they prove liberty rail actually committed a crime ,
unlike donna , whose only crime is working for me .
i &apos;m not investigating her for working for you .
i &apos;m investigating her for felony fraud .
what the hell are you talking about ?
the woman that let her in swears your secretary told her
she was with the national transportation safety board .
that &apos;s a federal agency ,
which makes what she did not a trick .
it makes it felony fraud .
my office . now .
close the door .
harvey , what happened ?
what happened is , you lied to me .
what are you talking about ?
you told their secretary you were with the ntsb ?
that &apos;s not what i said .
bullshit .
i know when i &apos;ve been lied to .
come clean right now .
i--
right the hell now .
i never said i was with them .
i said , &quot; have you ever heard of
the national transportation safety board ? &quot;
how is that any different ?
i &apos;m sorry , i--
you &apos;re sorry ?
harvey , i swear i didn &apos;t know that that made it a crime .
you knew when i point @-@ blank asked you ,
and you lied to me about it .
well , i thought that you would take care of it .
how can i take care of it
if you don &apos;t tell me the goddamn truth ?
do you think that i didn &apos;t want to tell you the truth ?
then why didn &apos;t you ?
because i was ashamed .
i know that it sounds stupid ,
but you and mike and everyone pull these rabbits
out of your hats all the time ,
and i just sit outside , and i answer the phones .
and then i got those documents , and people said i saved the day .
and the next thing i knew , you were on my doorstep
coming at me like i was some sort of criminal ,
and i panicked , and i lied .
donna--
i &apos;m sorry , harvey .
i know you are , but this just got
1,000 times harder for me to get out of .
you mean for you to get me out of .
donna , you of all people should understand by now
that to me they &apos;re the same thing .
what are you doing here ?
i went to see you at work . they said you called in sick .
i said , what are you doing here ?
i wanted to tell you the good news .
i &apos;m not dropping your case after all .
good for you .
hey , joe .
i know you &apos;ve been jerked around ,
but things are gonna change .
gonna change ? really ?
i thought you said you got the evidence in the wrong way .
well , and you said we should get it in the right way ,
so that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re gonna do .
like i said , good for you , but you &apos;re not gonna do it with me .
hey , joe .
i can &apos;t subpoena those records without the legitimate client .
i have no basis and no standing to move forward if i did .
oh , now you have time to explain procedure to me , right ?
okay , fine . i deserved that .
but , joe , this case cannot move forward without you .
you should have thought of that before you cut me loose .
they got to you , didn &apos;t they ?
they gave you a few dollars to shut you up ,
and then they sealed the agreement with no admission of guilt .
you know what ?
i can &apos;t comment on that , and you know why ,
but let &apos;s get one thing straight .
they didn &apos;t shut me up ; you did .
and if i took anything ,
it was because i had no other choice .
joe , listen to me .
if the check hasn &apos;t cleared , we can still get out of it .
don &apos;t come by here anymore .
so much for really caring about those people .
go to hell .
i thought nobody puts baby in the corner .
since when am i &quot; baby &quot; ?
since you &apos;re sitting in the corner .
you &apos;re usually a power table kind of girl .
well , i &apos;m not tonight .
jessica , what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s over between me and jeff .
what ? what happened ?
it &apos;s not important .
one day the man is calling me about taking you to paris ,
and the next it &apos;s over ,
and the reason for all that isn &apos;t important ?
no , it isn &apos;t , because right now ,
i have to decide whether he should stay at the firm .
well , then i &apos;d say the reason that you broke up is important .
and i don &apos;t want to get into it right now ,
because it &apos;s not going to change .
wow , heard that before .
leah , i &apos;m not like dad , and i &apos;m tired of hearing it .
i know you always say you &apos;re not like him ,
but here you are scrubbing up for the next surgery
instead of fighting for the man that you love .
you know what ?
most sisters would say , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , jessica , &quot;
and then give me a hug .
jessica , i am sorry that you &apos;re hurting ,
and if you want something sugarcoated ,
i &apos;ll order you dessert , but that is not how we show support .
you &apos;re right .
we show it by telling each other what we think , so ...
and what i think is ,
two days ago , this man loved you .
so unless you cheated on him , stole from him ,
or killed somebody , it seems to me the two of you
should be able to get past whatever it is you did do .
joe henderson backed out .
harvey , did you hear me ?
they paid him off . we have no case anymore .
and right now , i have a bigger problem .
donna lied .
what do you mean , she lied ?
i mean she didn &apos;t just bullshit her way into that file room .
she used the words &quot; national transportation safety board . &quot;
in what context ?
in the context of committing a crime to help you .
are you accusing me of knowing that she did that ?
if you didn &apos;t know , it &apos;s because you didn &apos;t want to know .
harvey , she told me she didn &apos;t steal those things .
i believed her the same way you did .
and you lied just like she did .
i did not lie .
then how come when i asked you where those documents came from ,
you didn &apos;t say所 one word about donna ?
because you wouldn &apos;t have listened to another word
i said after that , and i was trying to get the job done .
well , you got the job done by risking her .
and how is that different than all the times you risked me ?
because she &apos;s different .
harvey , i swear i didn &apos;t know .
well , like i said , right now , i &apos;ve got a bigger problem .
donna &apos;s gonna be charged with felony fraud ,
and she &apos;s guilty .
five elements .
what ?
proving fraud consists of five elements .
okay , i &apos;m aware of that , and they have all of them .
what about injury ?
how did donna injure liberty rail ?
you know how .
i know , and you know .
but evan smith isn &apos;t gonna sit in front of a jury
and explain why those documents have value
without exposing her client to criminal charges .
and without damages ,
what donna did is trespassing at the worst .
what do you want me to do ?
i want you to stay on the civil case .
harvey , the lawsuit is dead .
we don &apos;t have a plaintiff .
then get another one , because i &apos;m not letting
this woman get away with a goddamn thing .
all right ,
i &apos;m paying you the courtesy of a meeting .
what &apos;s on your mind ?
well , based on his reputation , i would say that
he &apos;s going to try to weasel his way out of this .
what i &apos;m going to do is save mr. wolf
from being embarrassed in open court .
and i &apos;m sure there &apos;s no side benefit to you in the process .
you do know you &apos;re gonna have to put ms. smith
on the stand , right ?
so do you ; that &apos;s why you had her come down here .
and did she tell you what donna actually took ?
you told me what donna took .
and i also told you that it proves they committed a crime ,
but she can &apos;t say that , which means all donna stole
was a meaningless stack of papers ,
and without actual damages--
i know the law .
then you know you &apos;ve got a shitty witness .
well ?
i can &apos;t get into the details of those documents ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean that they don &apos;t have value .
of course they have value . the saved you ass .
they &apos;re confidential . they have trade secrets .
the only secret that is in there
is that your trains kill people .
all right , enough .
ms. smith , if you can &apos;t show damages ,
i have no case .
you don &apos;t need damages .
you have intent .
and if you really knew my reputation ,
you &apos;d also know that i used to work here .
and i can tell you they &apos;ve never gone after anyone for intent
in the history of the d.a. &apos; s office ,
and they &apos;re not gonna start now .
it was good doing business with you , evan .
hey . how are things ?
you mean the things that you said that harvey
would take care of ?
yes , those are exactly the things i mean .
well , those are exactly the things
that harvey just took care of .
he did ?
he did .
louis , what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s just ... i know it wasn &apos;t gonna happen ,
but when you first told me they might press charges ,
the thought of you behind bars ...
oh , come on .
it just would have been some cushy , white @-@ collar resort .
i could have finally gotten my yoga certification--
it wouldn &apos;t have been .
but it doesn &apos;t matter , because i was right .
harvey did whatever it took .
thanks , louis .
god , he doesn &apos;t even know how lucky he is to have you .
norma &apos;s still out , isn &apos;t she ?
her goddamn sister tripped and fell in the tub ,
and she went to help .
it &apos;s like she doesn &apos;t even care about me at all .
i know you don &apos;t work in maintenance ,
but you do have access to accounts payable ,
so if you could ...
look--no--hey , please , just hear me ...
god damn it .
another one wouldn &apos;t take your call ?
no , none of them will .
i &apos;ve been through this entire directory .
as soon as i use the words &quot; crash , &quot; &quot; heat , &quot; or &quot; sensors , &quot;
they all stop talking .
mike , people died .
somebody &apos;s got to want to do the right thing .
well , if somebody does , i can &apos;t find them .
okay what about the victims &apos; families ?
oh , you mean the original plaintiffs .
yeah , the problem is , they already have a settlement .
go on . look at it .
they weren &apos;t stupid .
it prevents them from ever going after them again .
mike , i &apos;m just trying to help you .
i know you are . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just frustrated .
if i can &apos;t find a new plaintiff , i can &apos;t keep this case alive .
wait a second .
you said no one at the company will talk to you .
they won &apos;t , because they &apos;re all afraid they &apos;ll lose their job .
all right , so what about someone who has nothing left to lose ?
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about him .
so i rescheduled the meeting that you missed with latham
for 3 : 00 tomorrow .
here are the newest contracts .
also , kathy finn called about the takeover ,
so i sent her the latest specs , and i told her to sit tight .
and i noticed the left pen on your desk set was out of ink ,
so i had the cartridge replaced .
you could have done all of this while i was out of the office .
i know , but then i wouldn &apos;t have had a chance to thank you .
donna .
thank you , harvey .
you &apos;re welcome .
ms. paulsen , mr. specter .
terrance , you better be here to give donna a formal apology
from the d.a. &apos; s office .
no .
i &apos;m here to give her lawyer this .
harvey , what is that ?
donna , leave the room .
you can tell her to leave .
don &apos;t forget to tell her
her arraignment &apos;s 9 : 00 a.m. tomorrow morning .
arraignment ? for what ?
you son of a bitch .
you amended the charges to intent ?
you said it &apos;s never been done
in the history of the d.a. &apos; s office .
i decided to make history .
by going after someone for stealing nothing .
she went in there to find the hope diamond .
just because she came out with a piece of glass
doesn &apos;t mean it wasn &apos;t fraud .
that &apos;s exactly what it means .
every time i run into you ,
you tell me whatever shady thing just went down
was about the greater good or that it didn &apos;t happen
or this , that , or the other , but a crime was committed here ,
and i &apos;m going after her for it .
bullshit . you &apos;re going after me .
oh , you &apos;re telling me you didn &apos;t order her to do it .
no , i didn &apos;t .
well , we &apos;ll find out ...
when she &apos;s about to be convicted
and i offer her a deal .
what happens now ?
what happens now is , we go in there tomorrow
and enter a plea of not guilty .
but i am guilty .
donna , intent to commit fraud is a bullshit charge ,
and he &apos;s just using you to try to scare you .
well , it &apos;s working . i &apos;m scared .
donna--
what &apos;s the punishment ?
it doesn &apos;t matter , because i &apos;m gonna get you out of it .
harvey , what &apos;s the punishment ?
three to five years .
oh , my god .
three to five years for what ?
not now , louis .
i just saw terrance wolf at the elevator .
three to five years for what ?
he &apos;s charging her with intent to commit fraud .
holy shit .
louis , i don &apos;t want to hear it .
well , you &apos;re going to , because you were supposed to
get her out of this .
this isn &apos;t helping .
what the hell do you think i &apos;ve been doing ?
i don &apos;t know , but whatever it is , it didn &apos;t do a thing .
you have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
i told her that you were never gonna let her get in trouble .
it &apos;s not so simple .
what the hell isn &apos;t so simple ?
she &apos;s guilty .
wolf is trying to use her to turn on me ,
because he thinks i put her up to it .
did you ?
harvey didn &apos;t even know i did it .
you know what ? it doesn &apos;t even matter .
because i &apos;m taking over .
no , you &apos;re not .
he &apos;s trying to get her to turn on you .
you cannot be her lawyer .
she &apos;s not going to , so what difference does it make ?
the difference is ,
if you &apos;re out of the picture , wolf backs down .
from where he &apos;s standing , i &apos;m in the picture ,
and he &apos;s never gonna back down .
you don &apos;t know that , and this is donna &apos;s life .
and i &apos;m not putting it in your hands .
and it &apos;s not your decision to make .
no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s donna &apos;s .
and she &apos;s sticking with me .
louis , please , i know that you want to help ,
but just go .
mr. jaworski .
yeah .
my name is mike ross . i &apos;m with pearson specter litt .
this is rachel zane .
she &apos;s one of our associates .
sir , we &apos;d like to speak with you about the accident .
look , i was already deposed for that lawsuit .
the victims got paid .
i said everything i had to say , okay ?
we &apos;re not here to come after you .
we want you to sue liberty rail .
oh , yeah ? and why would i sue them ?
&apos;cause while you might have been driving the train ,
that accident wasn &apos;t your fault .
is this some kind of a joke ?
no , sir . it isn &apos;t .
they made you the fall guy .
bullshit . why would they do that ?
because they needed to blame someone ,
and not only were you at the wheel ,
you had no memory of what happened .
nah , i don &apos;t believe it .
they &apos;re a good company . they wouldn &apos;t do this .
mr. jaworski--
look , i killed those people .
and they still gave me early retirement
and let me keep my pension .
the reason they did that was to keep you quiet .
i need you to get off my property ,
both of you .
sir , you know that we &apos;re telling the truth .
yeah , well , is the truth gonna support the family of a guy
who can &apos;t get another job for the rest of his life ?
if we win , you &apos;ll be set up for life .
ah , take a look at me .
i ain &apos;t the guy who wins .
i &apos;m the guy who loses .
what if i can guarantee to take care of all of that
no matter what happens .
what would you need me to do ?
all rise .
you okay ?
am i gonna have to talk ?
just be polite and say &quot; your honor . &quot;
it will be over before you know it .
state versus donna paulsen .
is the defense counsel prepared to proceed with the arraignment ?
we are , your honor .
ms. paulsen , you have been charged
with felony intent to commit fraud .
this carries a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison .
do you understand the charges against you today ?
yes , your honor .
how do you plead ?
not guilty , your honor .
very well .
mr. wolf , is the state ready to go to trial ?
we are , your honor .
trial is set to begin monday .
next case .
all right , you made your point .
let &apos;s plead this down to a misdemeanor
and both go back to our real jobs .
this is my real job .
maybe if you had a little more respect for what it stands for ,
you wouldn &apos;t be standing here .
listen , i &apos;m gonna wipe that look off your smug face .
you give it a try , harvey ,
but i &apos;ve got all the evidence i need .
you &apos;re gonna have to go find yourself a new secretary .
i see you &apos;re back to not knocking .
i take it that means you &apos;ve made up your mind .
i have .
and ,
what i &apos;ve decided
is that you shut the door on me the other night ,
and it &apos;s not fair for you to dictate
what i do and don &apos;t get to say .
i told you .
it doesn &apos;t matter what you have to say ,
because whatever it is , i won &apos;t believe it .
well , what if i was here to tell you that i love you ?
jessica , you lied to me for months--
jeff , please .
just listen .
i know i hurt you ,
but you were the one
who wanted us to work together and be in a relationship .
and you were the one who thought it was a mistake .
because i was scared .
but i changed my mind ,
because you refused to give up .
and now i &apos;m refusing to give up .
i want you to stay here .
i want us to have both .
jessica--
you wanted me to let my walls down .
well , they &apos;re down .
donna , why don &apos;t you go home ?
you know i like to be alone when i &apos;m getting ready for a trial .
i need to talk to you .
what is it ?
i think maybe louis was right .
you think louis was right about what ?
maybe he should be handling my case .
okay , well , if that &apos;s how you feel .
i knew it ; i knew you would take this as an insult .
how exactly would you like me to take it ?
i would like you to take it seriously
and talk about it with me .
okay , donna ,
why exactly would you prefer louis to handle this ?
because i sat in that arraignment today ,
and it hit me for the first time
that i might actually go to prison .
and you were more concerned with attacking terrance wolf
than you were with me .
so you think louis is right .
i piss off the d.a. too much .
well , you sure did today .
because he &apos;s coming at us .
and you &apos;re pouring gas on the fire .
because that &apos;s what i do ,
and i don &apos;t need you
coming in here second @-@ guessing how i do my job .
harvey , why are you attacking me ?
i &apos;m not the enemy .
you sure as hell are right now .
what ? why am i the--
because i &apos;m getting ready for a fight ,
and you &apos;re telling me you don &apos;t think i can win .
i &apos;m not telling you that .
i &apos;m telling you that i &apos;m petrified .
and i understand , but i don &apos;t have time to comfort you .
well , i need you to make time .
and i can &apos;t , because--
harvey , this is my life !
when i told louis how you got me out of this thing ,
he told me how scared he was at the thought
of me going to prison ,
and i just ...
need ...
you ...
to--
donna , the thought of you going to prison
makes me want to drop to my knees .
you want to hear me say it ?
there it is .
but that &apos;s not gonna happen ,
because i &apos;m not gonna let it happen .
but in order to do that ,
you need to let me do what i do .
harvey--
that &apos;s enough .
you want someone to give you a hug ?
go to louis .
you want someone to get you out of this thing ,
you need to leave me alone .
i need to know everything you have ,
and i need to know right now .
we got the conductor to sign on ,
but we have to give him--
i don &apos;t care what i have to give him .
what does that give us ?
what do you mean ? it gives us standing .
now we can subpoena those records .
well , that &apos;s not enough .
it &apos;s a start .
i don &apos;t need a start .
i need a finish , and i need it now .
they &apos;re charging donna , aren &apos;t they ?
she was arraigned this morning .
if this thing goes to trial , i can &apos;t guarantee a win .
so we &apos;re back to trading the case for donna .
yeah , and i don &apos;t want to hear your moral objections
about those people getting away with murder .
i &apos;m not talking about that , harvey ,
but if donna was arraigned ,
it &apos;s not up to them to drop the charges .
it &apos;s up to wolf , and you know he &apos;s never gonna do that .
i &apos;m not talking about dropping the charges .
i &apos;m talking about making this whole damn thing go away .
harvey , if you &apos;re saying what i think you &apos;re saying ,
that &apos;s obstruction of justice .
the way i see it , it &apos;s justice .
you know what i mean .
i do , and i don &apos;t give a shit .
this is donna .
all right , i get it .
but what if what i have isn &apos;t enough ?
like you said , it &apos;s a start .
have an official complaint on my desk by the morning .
and what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna get us enough .
all right , i hear you . i hear you .
do you know who i am ?
no .
yeah , mike ross works for me .
hey , i don &apos;t give a shit .
i told him not to take your case in the first place ,
because i knew you were a goddamn shakedown artist ,
but now someone i care about is in trouble ,
because you took a payout .
get out of my face .
listen to me .
if you don &apos;t do what we need you to do ,
i will hurt you .
you better be prepared to kill me ,
because i &apos;m not gonna give that money back .
well , if this is just about money ,
then we don &apos;t need to fight at all .
harvey , this is becoming a habit .
i &apos;ve seen you more than my last three boyfriends .
somehow that doesn &apos;t surprise me .
you &apos;re funny .
i like you .
but i know you &apos;re not here to mock my relationship ,
so what &apos;s on your mind ?
we wanted to give you this .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s the lawsuit we filed on behalf of michael jaworski .
you know , the man you let take the fall for the accident .
michael jaworski can &apos;t sue--
what ?
sue you , because you were smart enough
to take care of his expenses ?
well , now i &apos;m taking care of his expenses .
and now we have standing ,
and we are going to subpoena those documents .
am i supposed to start quaking in my boots ?
nope , we know if you can doctor a report ,
you can alter those maintenance records .
i didn &apos;t alter anything .
well , that &apos;s not what joe henderson said .
he said you came to him , admitted everything ,
and offered him a settlement to keep quiet .
we didn &apos;t admit anything , and that settlement is sealed .
oh , you mean this settlement ?
we had an agreement .
well , here &apos;s the thing about paying people off , evan .
someone can always pay them more .
his word won &apos;t hold up against richard mcintyre &apos;s .
oh , he &apos;s not saying that richard mcintyre put him up to it .
he &apos;s saying you did .
that &apos;s bullshit .
and does that really matter ?
what do you want ?
you made the author of that report disappear .
you made joe henderson disappear .
figure out a way to make the witness against donna
change her tune .
that &apos;s obstruction of justice .
that &apos;s not my problem .
you son of a bitch .
it &apos;s your call .
maybe people will believe joe , maybe they won &apos;t ,
but instead of making money ,
you &apos;re gonna be defending yourself in court
for the next five years .
you &apos;re so sure we did this , you &apos;re really gonna let us
get away with murder for your secretary ?
you &apos;re damn right i am , and if i had to do it again ,
i &apos;d do it 100 times .
what &apos;s that ?
you know that it is .
jeff -- - jessica , you were right .
we either need to have both , or it &apos;s not going to work .
and you don &apos;t want both ?
effective immediately , i &apos;m tendering my resignation .
then i wish you luck .
good luck , jessica .
do you remember ?
yes , of course i remember . it happened right there .
well , it was your fault ,
&apos;cause you made me burst out laughing .
you didn &apos;t just burst .
you spat a piece of shrimp across the room
and into the back of my mother &apos;s hair .
and she didn &apos;t even feel it because of all the hair spray ,
and it stuck in there like a tick .
oh , my god .
i could hardly look at her or that boyfriend
for the next two hours .
what was his name again ?
who cares ? he was such a loser .
oh , come on ; he was the reason you had
that god @-@ awful party in the first place .
thank you , harvey .
you don &apos;t need to thank me . you already thanked me .
no , i thanked you for fixing it .
now i &apos;m thanking you for not bringing it up all night .
i just figured if you wanted it brought up ,
you &apos;d bring it up , and now you have , so ...
i told you i &apos;d never let anything happen to you ,
and i won &apos;t ever ,
so you don &apos;t ever have to feel scared like that again .
i thought you said you didn &apos;t do the comfort thing .
i didn &apos;t say i didn &apos;t do it .
i said i didn &apos;t have time ,
because i was so busy saving your ass .
i &apos;m sorry i doubted you .
i &apos;m sorry i snapped at you .
anyone else every loses faith in me ,
it doesn &apos;t matter .
but with you , it &apos;s different .
i should go .
why ?
you know why .
you know i love you , donna .
