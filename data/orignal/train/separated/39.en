This is Derrick's in-house investigator, Blake, from D.C.
You a friend of Leela's?
I'm a who?
Um, sorry. Kalinda's.
Whatever games you're playing,
you play with her. I'm too busy, okay?
You know there was something weird about that case,
that something got buried. Pitted.
Evidence. Or testimony.
Mr. Childs, you were under intense pressure
to convict someone for the Northbrook killings, weren't you?
It's my job to prosecute criminals, so there's always pressure.
Mr. Childs, you were under intense pressure
to convict someone for the Northbrook killings, weren't you?
It's my job to prosecute criminals.
There's always pressure.
Did you give an interview on June 11th,
promising "Swift accountability and justice" For the sniper?
I don't recall.
Chicago Tribune, op-ed: "Chicagoans need not fear,
this case will be solved by the end of the month"?
And it was.
Even if corners were cut?
They were not.
You may not have been aware they were.
This is my department.
I have to be aware of everything. And I am.
You had Wyatt Stevens arrested?
Wyatt Stevens was arrested because Wyatt Stevens was guilty.
You stand by the prosecution of Wyatt Stevens.
I stand by every prosecution this office has taken on in my tenure.
Unlike earlier holders of my office,
I do not prosecute without a good faith belief
that the defendant is guilty.
I think you're right. Go with "Unfair prejudice."
My co-counsel wants to go with
prejudice and cumulative evidence.
No, no, no, no, not with Judge Hale.
She hates a fire hose defense.
But this is good.
"Prejudice as policy." that's a very nice turn of phrase.
Thank you.
You might use Trent v. Paddock.
It's a good 403 separation.
Okay. I'll look into it.
What's up, Eli?
Alicia, don't leave yet.
I'm late for work.
Just wait a second, Eli.
Um, the settlement in the, in the sniper case, the Northbrook sniper?
Did... did you depose Childs?
Um... Peter, I can't. I'm under a gag order.
I can't say anything.
Is it bad?
So am I supposed to worry they're still asking for $8 million?
Yep.
Javier, you wouldn't be happy unless you had something to worry about.
Look, we've got a good judge, a good motion,
and we succeeded in combining our defenses,
so we can't be used against each other.
Okay.
I just... this is getting to me.
Once more into the breach, eh?
Yep.
I'd like to argue the unfair prejudice motion, Andre.
Certainly. And I'll take cumulative.
Actually, I was thinking we'd be stronger with just one.
Judge Hale doesn't like a fire hose defense.
Really. And how do we know that?
All rise.
Good morning.
Judge Hale has been called away for a family emergency,
so I will be presiding.
We'll be hearing pretrial motions today?
That's right, Your Honor.
And if I may say so, welcome aboard.
Well, thank you, Mr. Deerfield.
We got you out of the lecture room, I see.
Only to argue a case I believe in.
And yet I seem to see you're outnumbered today.
Yes, yes. I do feel a bit like David.
I think that's a bit of a stretch, Mr. Deerfield.
I found something to worry about.
Chicago!
Move it, Chicago!
What happened to Hale?
Some family emergency. Do you know anything about Quinn?
I'll see what I can get.
Can we get some medical attention down here?
Pull her up!
Your Honor, that is cell phone video
of the death of five young concertgoers.
It is essential evidence--
It is prejudicial evidence.
Well, how is it prejudicial?
The families are suing two people.
Jay Hawke, AKA D.J. Javier Berlin,
for overselling his concert,
and Mr. Brownback's security firm
for allowing too many people in.
At the very minimum, this video shows an oversold concert.
No, at the very minimum, it shows a selectively edited,
highly prejudicial video intended to inflame the jury.
Counselor... what are you wearing?
Your Honor?
What are you wearing?
What... what are those clothes?
I think they're Ralph Lauren.
Yes, thank you. No, I mean... your pants.
You're... you're wearing pants.
Yes... It's a pantsuit.
I see that.
In my courtroom, I require the male lawyers to wear ties,
and the female lawyers, skirts.
Am I making myself clear?
I can't believe it. Does he do this in every court?
He can't do this to every female lawyer.
My guess is you're right.
So why me? What did I do?
You're being taxed.
Why?
The Childs deposition.
What's going on? Peter mentioned that, too.
It was in McGowan's column this morning.
The deposition? How?
It was leaked.
And they think I leaked it.
To hurt Childs and help Peter.
That's the spin in the column.
Look, you're his wife, one of the only few people in the room...
We didn't win a single motion.
I'm meeting with our co-counsel now to rethink strategy.
So what's our endgame?
We want to keep our client's exposure to the insurance limit:
half a million.
I don't imagine the plaintiff will accept a half million?
Not after today.
Okay. Do the best you can; anything to get the settlement down.
Uh, do you need Blake on this?
No, no... Kalinda's good.
Oh, Alicia, one more thing.
Regarding this, uh, leaked deposition.
I had nothing to do with it.
All three of us were there.
It's just that... the firm is in a precarious position on this,
so it would be helpful if your husband didn't exploit it.
Okay.
If you have any sway there.
She didn't do it?
It's unlike her.
Uh, you phoned: my co-counsel, Mr. Baylon, is here?
Hello. I didn't know it was you.
Miss Crozier.
Yes.
Remember, from last year. We were on opposite sides.
I do.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I've forgotten your name.
Alicia.
Alicia, right. Mm-hmm.
That's so funny; we'll be on the same side this time.
I don't understand.
I've been asked to
replace Mr.Baylon as the counsel for the security firm?
He's having some surgery.
He's... no, I-I just saw him.
I know. It was all very last-minute.
It's-- I-- we're all kind of shocked.
But I'm here... and raring to go.
Courtney... get Mr. Baylon on the phone.
Deviated septum.
He gets elective surgery one day before the trial
because he doesn't like the judge.
Oh, Alicia, he said you were expecting him,
so I put him in your office.
Hello.
You seem to spend more time here
than you did when you actually worked here.
You still sharing Courtney?
Everything's the same.
Okay. Well, I don't want to delay the drama.
You've been served.
I've... For what?
State's attorney has asked me
to head up an inquiry to look into the leak of Mr. Childs' deposition.
Now, I'm going to try and expedite this, Alicia,
so that you don't have a cloud hanging over your head.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Personally, I know that you would never break the law in this manner,
so I'm sure it's just a formality.
And if it's not,
then we'll be pursuing a disbarment hearing.
See you soon.
You're not getting anything from me, Eli.
I'm not burning my source.
Source?
Or sources.
You know why I love politics?
People make sense.
They do things that make sense.
That's why this leak bothers me.
It doesn't make any strategic sense.
It hurts Childs, because it makes his office look bad.
It hurts Peter, because it places his wife under suspicion,
and then I realized: that's the point.
Someone wants to hurt them both.
And that got me thinking.
Childs and Florrick have their hands around each other's throats.
What a perfect time for a third person to enter the race.
So who is it?
Give me a quote.
I'll see if they want to respond.
They?
Give me a quote. I'll see if he, she, it wants to respond.
"These kind of dirty tricks--
even if perpetrated by an unannounced third candidate--
are despicable."
Got it.
She had my hand.
I told her,
"Whatever you do, don't let go"
And that's her?
My fiancee. Yes.
Juliette.
The crowd was just so--
It was like fighting the ocean.
I couldn't hold her. She went down.
Parents wanted an open casket, but...
the way she was trampled...
I didn't know a person could look like that.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dylan,
but I need you to be strong for a little while longer,
because the defense has to ask you a few questions.
Objection!
Sure. If you want. Sustained. Your witness.
Mr. Dylan, I'm very sorry for your loss.
Wish your clients were.
I think they are.
Speaking of my clients,
they weren't the first ones you sued, were they?
Objection! Your Honor!
Approach the bench.
Your Honor, the plaintiff first tried to sue the real culprit: the venue.
Oh, come on.
The venue staff opened the exit doors.
That's what sparked the stampede and the only reason we're being sued
is because the venue went bankrupt after the incident.
These are honorable people.
I'm not going to stand by silently and let her disparage them.
I- I'm sorry. Is that an argument?
Your Honor,
who my client sued or failed to sue is immaterial here.
They are suing the codefendants now. That's all that matters.
The objection is sustained.
Further questions of any previous suit is off-limits.
Now, step back.
I said, step back.
So, is my skirt short enough?
Next time, ask that in front of the court reporter, ma'am.
And we will discuss an appropriate fine.
Now, step back.
Put me in, coach.
Our strategy was to blame the venue on the panic.
We can't blame security because they're our co-defendant.
There's someone else you can blame.
Who?
The victims.
Do you have a problem with that?
You mean, as a lawyer or as a person?
It's a rave.
I'm sure the victims must have contributed to the panic.
The jury may not love it, but they'll believe it.
I'll get on it.
He didn't get a seat at the gala.
He didn't? No!
Courtney? Can you get Kalinda for me, please?
Sure.
And Mr. Gold phoned.
Oh, I'll call him back later.
What's going on?
Oh, nothing. It's the gala. The bar fund-raiser.
The partners bought five tables. Everyone wants to see who's invited.
And Ziegler wasn't.
Ziegler from tax litigation? Why not?
Well... you know, probably means he's being laid off.
Ah. Um...
Oh, don't worry,
none of the second-year associates were invited.
Oh, good. I hate that stuff.
Oh, you're here. Good.
Problems?
Yes, he wants me to carry a parasol now.
Anything new?
Yeah. This just went up.
What do you think of him?
Blake?
I don't know. Why?
Just asking.
It's the same cell phone camera.
How do you know?
Oh, same voice.
Mm-hmm. Best evidence rule.
Judge should admit the whole video. This is part of the video.
There's stuff in there that might help you blame the victims.
Thanks.
Oh, um, Kalinda...
Look, I don't want to get in the middle of anything.
All right.
Blake keeps calling you Leela.
He seems to want to make some kind of point with it.
Okay.
She's splitting the male vote, that's what she's doing.
She could win. She's the only female candidate.
Damn right she could. We could've buried that bitch.
You think you could say that a little louder?
I don't think those kids heard you.
We got to scare her off.
Up until the moment she announces, it's revocable.
Okay. Do it.
The gloves come off?
Are you saying that she leaked Alicia's deposition?
Yes. The transcripts went through her office.
Take the gloves off.
Thank you, sir.
Your Honor, I don't know
what the defense counsel expects this to prove,
but there is no evidence
that this video is part of the already submitted exhibit.
The evidence is that the same person is recording the video.
I don't think that's conclusive, counselor.
But it is persuasive, Your Honor.
It has the same images in common, it has the same voice.
"After the Fall"
Yeah. Yes, it is.
I played Maggie in high school.
No...
My goodness, that was a tough part.
Um, Nancy.
That's my daughter.
Yale Drama.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
"I been killed by a lot of people,
"some couldn't hardly spell, but it is the same, mister."
At my high school,
we had to take out all the dirty words.
Your Honor... could I have a ruling?
You know, it's funny.
My daughter wanted to play Maggie,
but I think she was a much better Holga.
So, is it an act?
Is what an act?
Why don't you take the next witness?
Sure.
You've worked as a medic at the arena for how long?
Four years.
I've been at two dozen raves,
but I've never seen one as crowded as that.
That was bad, wasn't it?
It's our turn now.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I don't know much about this rave business.
It's like a concert, right?
Yes.
Except with loud music?
It's kind of like trance-like music?
Yes.
It sounds kind of repetitive to me.
But what do I know? I like the Beatles.
Objection.
Sustained.
Sorry. I will withdraw my musical opinions.
So I'm wondering if you can help me out with something.
What is that... there, on that woman's necklace?
Oh. It's a pacifier.
Like a baby's pacifier?
Why would someone wear a pacifier to a concert?
Ecstasy tends to make people grind their teeth,
and the pacifier is intended to stop that.
You're kidding.
I'm always amazed by the things I don't know in the world.
Objection.
Overruled.
Now, that's one of the victims there, wearing a pacifier?
It is.
So one could conclude that that person had taken the drug ecstasy?
Yes, but ecstasy tends to calm people.
It doesn't make them stampede.
It calms them? Like this?
I have no way to diagnose that.
Now, in your first aid kit, at the arena,
you have over 50 packs of something called--
Ben...
Benzodiazepines?
Yeah...
Um, why so much of that?
It's helpful in treating PCP.
PCP. That's another drug.
Is that one also calming?
No.
No, in fact, it's the opposite.
It makes kids violent. Is that right?
Yes.
Now, sometimes, these ecstasy pills are laced with PCP.
Yes.
Oh, my goodness.
I can see how this could happen.
No further questions.
Good job.
Thank you.
...also expect a delay of 30 to 40 minutes on the Eisenhower Expressway.
So let's sit back and enjoy
Jane Jensen's "Luv Song."
*Hey, here's a love song for your boyfriend*
*A love song for your new boyfriend*
*He's gotta be cool like James Dean*
*And burn like fire*
*He's sweet like sugar*
*Or like custard and desire*
*Never backs away from a good fight*
*Oh, yeah, never gets sleepy*
*He goes down all night*
*Love song for your boyfriend*
*Love song for your boyfriend*
What are you waiting for?
Go report it.
It's just petty harassment.
You two and Alicia will say
you didn't leak Childs' deposition,
what can they do, hold their breath?
It's costing us time.
But it's not costing us clients.
They like it when we get in the face of the State's Attorney.
Um, are you plus one?
Am I...?
For the gala.
Are you bringing a date?
I'm arranging the partners' table.
Oh, yeah. What is it again?
The Cook County Bar Association Fund-raiser Gala.
Right-- CCBAFG.
How could I miss it?
Plus one.
Good.
Someone over 25 this time?
Sure, she doesn't have homework.
Derrick? How 'bout you?
Plus one?
No, just myself.
Oh. Well, that leaves... two seats at our table.
Which one of the equity partners do you want to drag up?
How about the Florricks?
Did I say something?
No, it's just, Alicia's a second year.
I don't think we're inviting associates.
Yes, but it would look good to clients
to have her husband at our table.
Yeah. How about it, Will?
There's room right here, next to your plus one.
Look, if I'm stepping on any toes, just...
No toes. Sure, great.
The Florricks. Go for it.
This is funny, isn't it?
All these connections.
My old workplace, my old boss, my old coworker...
and my new boss competing with your husband.
And then there's you two and...
your thing.
Chicago.
Shall we start?
Yeah.
So, Mrs. Florrick...
did you leak the deposition you conducted with Mr. Childs?
No.
Good.
So we're done here.
Did you tell your husband
about Mr. Childs' deposition?
No.
And is it fair to say
that you never leaked
confidential information to your husband?
It is.
Good, because that would be a disbarrable offense.
And is it also fair to say that you never
discuss confidential trial information with your husband?
It is.
Good.
There it is.
So, last year, September 2009, when you first started here
at Lockhart & Gardner, was your first case
a pro bono murder trial involving a supposed carjacking?
Yes.
And in this trial, you presented evidence that the Chicago PD
pitted-- or buried-- evidence, is that right?
Yes.
Where'd you get this information?
Objection, Cary.
What does this have to do with the leaked deposition?
Mrs. Florrick has claimed that she and her husband
never discuss confidential trial information.
That wasn't a confidential trial.
Perfect. Then she shouldn't mind answering.
I'm going to request a recess on this.
I want to review the law on this situation.
Yeah, sure.
The law-- that's what you want to review.
Okay. Talk to me.
I...
We have attorney-client privilege, Alicia.
Talk to me.
Peter told me there was pitted evidence.
But I pursued it myself;
I found the pitted evidence myself.
But you only pursued it because Peter pointed you there.
Okay.
Did you solicit this information?
No.
Then it's a passive breach.
He broke confidentiality; you didn't.
Yes, but he was only trying to help me.
I see that, but that doesn't matter.
He broke confidentiality.
Will...
This is a fishing expedition.
Of course it is.
But at least you know you're not the target; Peter is.
I can't hurt him.
He was trying to help me.
Alicia, listen to me.
You're a lawyer.
Under oath, you have to tell the truth.
This isn't just about you.
This is about the firm, too.
Okay, what?
There's gonna be a third candidate.
Who?
First off, lay off Alicia.
Okay, Peter, you know your mistake--
never show your opponent your weak flank.
Well, we both have weak flanks;
and the person that leaked your depo was trying to weaken us both.
Your mysterious third candidate?
Presiding Judge Adler.
That might prove a bit difficult.
Not after she retires.
Now, when I was in office,
I investigated her for judicial bribes.
So use it, Peter.
Why do you need me?
Well, my guess is that you have more.
Thanks for answering a few more questions, Mr. Dylan.
I'm sorry to have to ask you this,
but did you drop ecstasy the night of the stampede?
Yes.
And your fiancee Juliette, did she?
I'm sorry, but I have to ask.
No... you don't.
You don't have to ask anything.
You're trying to blame me.
No, I'm trying...
I saw her die.
I saw...
She was the best thing that ever happened to me,
and I saw her crushed.
Any more questions?
Thank you.
Just one from me, Your Honor.
Oh, go on.
I'm sorry, Paul...
if my co-counsel's efforts to protect Mr. Berlin
have hurt you in any way.
Don't ever do that.
Oh, you were turning off the jury.
You don't undercut your co-counsel!
You didn't see them.
You know what this is.
You know we're going to lose,
and you want my client to take the brunt of the award.
That's silly.
Do not pick a battle with me, lady;
not in the mood I'm in.
Well, let's see who wins.
You have my credit card receipt?
I need it to, uh, return the rental car.
So... how do I escalate this?
Any way you want, scout.
I'm game.
I looked into your background, uh, Kalinda.
The, uh, Menlo Park childhood,
the nice suburban home,
the immigrant parents.
It doesn't exist.
And you seem to have a past history with Will Gardner.
We've both been busy.
.357, huh?
It's... it's kind of a big and sloppy gun.
You-You butchering deer or... compensating for something?
You want to find out?
What, is that too close?
How about this?
Or this?
It's a little ham-fisted, don't you think?
Using sex?
I don't know.
Let me feel.
Yeah, you're right.
Feels very ham-fisted.
Take care.
Yeah, it was horrible.
Next day, the walls were crushed, had to be re-drywalled.
Which doorway was it?
The one that opened?
Over there.
But this wasn't like this, though, right?
The stage? No. The stage slides.
They wanted more room, so they slid it over.
That's where it happened.
Weird, huh?
Five kids died right here.
What's that?
The skids.
Holds the stage in place.
This looks new.
Was it recently replaced?
Yeah. It didn't have a cover that night.
This could be the reason why people tripped.
Who moved the stage?
Oh, I don't know.
I didn't work that night.
I'd talk to Rich,
but he doesn't work here anymore.
They did a sweep about a month ago.
Sweep?
Immigration?
Yeah.
Do you have his number?
So I imagine you had a chance to review the law.
I did.
Good.
So shall we just pick up right where we left off?
It's your rodeo.
All right.
We, uh, were discussing your first case here, Mrs. Florrick.
A murder case.
And I asked you--
let's see-- quote:
"You presented evidence that the Chicago PD had pitted--
"or buried-- evidence, is that right""
And you said,
"Yes."
And I asked, "Where did you get this information?"
So... can you answer that?
I can.
Please do so now.
I got the information from the original discovery.
I found a page missing in the defense's xerox.
You do know you're under oath?
I do.
Before you discovered the missing page in the discovery,
did anyone else tell you about the pitted evidence?
No.
I think I'll object to that.
Object to what?
This line of questioning.
This line of questioning is on point, Mr. Gardner.
It goes to confirm or rebut
Mrs. Florrick's assertion
that she and her husband never discussed confidential trial information.
No. But nice try.
Then let's call the judge.
Good. Let's call him.
Well, he'll side with me.
He probably will.
He'll also allow me to haul Mr. Childs in for questioning.
Mr. Childs welcomes a full airing on this matter.
My guess is he won't welcome
a full airing on a matter I have first-hand knowledge of,
and intend to question him about, under oath.
And what matter is that?
Something that'll hurt him
a hell of a lot more than this'll hurt Peter.
I wish when people threatened, they actually used words.
I'll guarantee you this, Cary:
When you go back to your boss and report what we just discussed,
he'll be relieved we didn't use words.
Thank you.
Will, I...
I just hated how he was doing that... that's all.
We're invited to the gala tomorrow night.
Would you like me not to go?
No. It'll be fun. Go.
I need you to talk to someone for me.
Who?
Victoria Adler.
The presiding judge?
I was made to understand you were friends.
Well... we were.
Oh. Not anymore?
She asked me to run for a judgeship.
Then she asked me not to.
We believe that she's going to use
her keynote speech tomorrow night to announce her candidacy.
For what?
State's Attorney.
So excuse the irony, but we need you to ask her not to run.
Thank you, Cook County Bar Association for this acknowledgment.
And thank you for that overwhelming introduction.
Vicky.
Do you have a minute?
What's that?
The reasons not to run.
Who put you up to this?
Does it matter?
It does to me.
You and I want a women candidate, Vicky. But you're not it.
Let's find someone in four years.
So this is dirt? On me?
You run, you'll set us back ten years.
They'll say it's because it's a woman, and not because...
I'm corrupt?
So, how does this work?
I promise not to run and this stuff goes away?
Probably something like that.
You're enjoying this, aren't you?
We've had our difficulties, but...
I am not enjoying this.
Okay...
I promise not to run.
What's up?
I found him.
I know that's supposed to mean something to me...
Sorry. Rich Salazar.
He was with the arena. Maintenance.
He helped move the stage to the center of the arena,
exposing these.
Security was supposed to have covered them with plywood,
but they thought nobody would come through that door.
And that's what tripped people?
Yeah. Afterwards, client security covered them,
before the cops got there.
Security covered them?
And he will testify to that?
He will.
Oh...
What?
The joint defense agreement.
I've got to get Crozier to approve
before putting him on the stand.
And she won't approve, because it'll make her client look guilty.
Wait a minute-- you don't need Crozier's approval;
you need your co-counsel's approval.
Yeah, but...
Mr. Baylon, how are you doing?
This is Kalinda Sharma; she's here to witness
your approval of my adding a new witness.
Rich Salazar.
He was a custodian at the arena.
Do you approve, sir?
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Baylon.
And have a... a good recovery.
Mr. Rich Salazar.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I was not informed of this witness.
Who is he?
He was with arena maintenance
and will testify to certain acts by the security team.
What's going on?
New strategy.
I'm sorry, Your Honor; we have a joint defense agreement.
We both need to approve of this witness.
And I didn't.
I... I don't.
No, my joint defense agreement is with Mr. Baylon.
And he consented in your stead.
Here's the affidavit.
This all looks in order, Miss Crozier.
Anything else?
No, not at the moment.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Praise the struggling worker.
The sounds of their trucks.
Ahoogha. The horn.
God bless the horn.
Praise the sound of the foundry.
Why're you so nervous?
I'm not nervous.
Want me to discuss Derrek Lee's free agency again?
You know how that turns me on.
Who's that?
One of those two guys is going to be the next state's attorney.
Really? They seem like friends.
Yep. Politics.
I hate politics.
I love that about you.
I... hate... politics.
Politics. Hate.
Praise the child digging in the sand,
singing her song:
"I am a little teapot short and stout,
here is my handle and here is my spout."
In her words, she sings the song...
Well, we're really up front, aren't we?
Table three.
You look good.
You, too. Grownup clothes.
Oop, sorry. This is Tamara.
Ta... Tammy.
Hi. Alicia.
I need some wine.
Did you get the verdict?
We did.
And?
Three million dollars.
We pay two,
the co-defendant pays the rest.
Two million?
No.
Two dollars.
You're kidding.
The price of the filing.
Lawyers. I don't get lawyers.
They seem to always want to trick people.
Tamara's a reporter.
The Sporting News.
We sit and wait for a bus.
Hush-hush. Here it comes.
Here it comes.
Thank you, Nana.
And welcome. What a year it's been.
There you are.
I was wondering what happened to you.
Late verdict.
Good verdict?
Yes.
Let's celebrate.
...women's causes for decades.
She is without a doubt my mentor.
Victoria.
You're happy.
Yep.
Kept a third candidate out of the race.
Thank you, Cook County Bar Association for this acknowledgement,
and thank you, Diane, for that overwhelming introduction.
I know you share this sentiment:
that women have far too long found themselves
the afterthought in Chicago jurisprudence.
Always we hear the same thing: four more years,
four more years.
But it is not the four more years of re-election;
it is the four more years of "Just wait..."
Oh, no...
"Then it will be your turn."
And so, tonight, I am pleased to announce
a new candidate in the race for state's attorney.
I mean no disrespect to the two other current candidates--
both here and both capable--
but every now and then, you need a woman to clean house.
And that woman is... Wendy Scott-Carr.
Time to clean house.
She was in the deposition. She leaked it.
Thank you so much.
My mother and my grandmother were housecleaners,
so I guess I can continue the tradition.
