the door &apos;s open .
how you doing ?
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s dark in here .
no .
now , don &apos;t be that way .
he misses you .
it &apos;s not just the money .
he wants you back .
where is he ?
home .
he sent me here to ...
don &apos;t , bill .
it &apos;s a phone . i &apos;m just getting you on ...
you pull it out , and i &apos;ll shoot your hand off .
get down on your knees .
and keep your hand where it is .
who called my work ?
who ? y @-@ your lawyer called us .
we returned .
phone , huh ?
who called her at home ?
your lawyer ?
uh , i did . why ?
what was that for ? !
he &apos;ll get angry if i don &apos;t answer .
aah , you bitch !
you stupid bitch !
you bitch !
quiet , bill .
go to hell .
just go to hell .
hi , honey .
bill &apos;s here . you want to talk to him ?
just so you know ,
the money is mine-- community property .
i don &apos;t want any trouble , but i am staying put and it &apos;s over .
i &apos;ve moved on . you should , too .
you run again ,
he &apos;ll find you .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . i don &apos;t know .
is that for us ?
what &apos;d we do ?
okay , uh , zach , put your signal on .
grace , turn the radio down .
i shouldn &apos;t have fallen asleep .
hi there . how &apos;s it going ?
it &apos;s good .
can i see your driver &apos;s license , registration
and proof of insurance ?
sure .
what &apos;d we do wrong ?
grace .
where you all headed ?
uh , home . chicago . highland park .
and where you coming from ?
washington university .
we were checking out colleges .
ah . sorry , i can &apos;t really hear very well here .
could you step back with me ,
i &apos;ll tell you why i stopped you ?
sure .
how fast were we going ?
i don &apos;t know .
not that fast .
maybe it &apos;s uncle owen &apos;s car ?
maybe he has tickets or something .
wait here .
tell him we just bought it .
everything all right , officer ?
yes , ma &apos;am . why don &apos;t you stay right there ,
and i &apos;ll be right with you .
so there &apos;s nothing wrong ?
thank you , son .
as i was just telling your son , about a half mile back
i saw him hit the brake lights when he saw me and then speed up again .
i thought maybe he was having some trouble .
was he ?
having some trouble ?
no .
he said you were asleep , so ...
just so you know , officer , my son just bought this car ...
here &apos;s the thing .
your son seemed a bit worried
when i was talking to him just now ,
and this roadway is a major conduit
for drugs , money , weapons ...
he &apos;s 17 years old , being questioned by a police officer .
that &apos;s probably why .
you &apos;re probably right , but ,
if you don &apos;t mind , i have my k @-@ 9 in my car here .
i &apos;d like to just run him around your vehicle ,
just to be on the safe side .
officer , are we being profiled here ?
i ... how do you mean , ma &apos;am ?
well , i was asleep in the backseat ,
and you saw two kids driving at 8 : 00 in the morning .
you thought maybe drugs ?
而仅因为车主属于 &quot; 可疑人群 &quot; 是不合法的
no .
but if you don &apos;t mind , ma &apos;am ,
i &apos;d really like to run my dog around your car ,
and you &apos;ll be on your way .
and if i do mind ?
it &apos;s like a police state .
you should just use dad &apos;s name .
what ?
why ?
he &apos;ll stop hassling us if he knows
you &apos;re connected with the state &apos;s attorney .
that &apos;s cook county . this is madison county ,
and we don &apos;t do that .
we don &apos;t use dad &apos;s name ; we use the law .
you use dad &apos;s name ?
how do we use the law ?
hey , cary , it &apos;s alicia .
do you know anyone in madison county &apos;s state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
we &apos;ve just been pulled over on interstate 55,
and i think it &apos;s a result of profiling .
so i need to get the , uh , patrol car &apos;s dashboard camera .
go , mom .
yeah . get him fired .
you should call his captain .
sure . i &apos;ll see what i can do .
you got the car number ?
yes . it is ...
4 @-@ 1 @-@ 9 . it &apos;s an officer robb and it &apos;s k @-@ 9 unit .
no problem .
oh , yeah , and eli called .
something about the interview .
i forgot .
thanks , i &apos;ll call him .
i &apos;m not upset . do i sound upset ?
you just threatened to sue us .
no , i said i was going to sue you .
that &apos;s not a threat ; that &apos;s a fact .
i &apos;m packing up and filing a suit .
david , this balloon payment came due
at the exact moment we lost our top client .
we are suffering through the worst recession ...
okay , at a certain point ,
you have to stop with the recession talk and own this bankruptcy .
look , we definitely have some issues to work out internally ,
but if you leave now and file suit ...
yep , always in time for the fall of saigon .
美国称之为西贡沦陷
uh , h @-@ hold on , eli .
okay , here &apos;s the thing .
i run my dog around your car , and on the passenger side ,
he starts scratching and barking .
i now have probable cause to search in the state of illinois .
but i want to give your son one last chance ,
so if he has any small personal amount of marijuana ,
i need to know .
search if you &apos;re gonna search .
sorry , eli . actually , i &apos;m gonna be late .
what ? why ? we arranged this weeks ago .
well , circumstances are beyond my control .
this is a national sit @-@ down , alicia .
you &apos;ve got to get it under control .
okay , got to go .
peggy .
i &apos;m just showing peter a campaign ad , eli .
that &apos;s all . it &apos;s not an ambush .
let me just say this to jax , who is watching on tv right now
and has been an inspiration to me every single day of my life .
my dad asked me if it was all right if he runs ,
and i said yeah ,
&apos;cause he does a really good job of taking care of me ,
and i think he &apos;d do a really good job of taking care of everyone .
i am running for governor of the great state of illinois .
so , kresteva is making the campaign about family values ?
look , i think the campaign &apos;s about a lot of things :
our bankrupt state , drugs coming across the border , education ...
but kresteva is dening himself as a good father and husband ,
and you , in a recent deposition ,
are admitting that you are separated from your wife .
separated but working to mend fences .
look , peggy ,
this is gonna be a long campaign .
kresteva is the republican candidate
i will be facing in four months .
my goal now is to win the democratic nomination .
the democratic committee stands beside you ,
so isn &apos;t that a foregone conclusion ?
in politics , nothing is a foregone conclusion .
i win the nomination , you can ask me
all you want about kresteva and his attempts to , uh ...
redefine himself as a family man .
his &quot; attempts &quot; ? do i detect a hint of sarcasm ?
in four months you can detect a hint of sarcasm .
okay , i didn &apos;t find any drugs at this time in your vehicle ,
but i did find shake , marijuana shake ,
under your front seat .
what ? !
my guess is this is what my dog was signaling .
mom , that &apos;s ...
shh , shh .
okay , um , thank you , officer .
so , i &apos;m gonna give you
a ticket and a warning at this time and let you go .
so , if there &apos;s nothing , uh ...
son , raise your hand .
son , i said raise your hand .
is that a recording device ?
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s an iphone .
an iphone set to record ?
yes .
recording an officer is a crime , son .
under article 14 of the illinois criminal code ,
it &apos;s a class 1 felony .
actually , that was overturned in the seventh circuit .
no , it wasn &apos;t . two @-@ party consent is still on the books .
and i ask you to erase that recording right now .
wait , so it &apos;s illegal to record you doing something illegal ?
i &apos;m not doing anything illegal ,
and either you erase the recording
or i &apos;ll impound the phone .
mom ?
just do it , zach .
this is so wrong .
i know . just do it .
i need you to erase the recording , son .
now .
did you just e @-@ mail it ?
okay .
everyone , let &apos;s just take a breath .
son , did you just e @-@ mail that recording ?
it was a mistake .
i did .
put your hands behind your back .
we are $ 60 million in debt , your honor .
this is mostly due to unforeseen circumstances :
the loss of a major client ,
late receivables and an ...
exponential increase in our lease .
we believe if we are given
immediate relief from our creditors ,
we will need five months to satisfy this debt .
my son has a felony notice to appear .
he what ?
why ?
the cop said there was marijuana shake in the car ,
but that &apos;s not why .
yeah , shake is what they say when they don &apos;t find anything .
what is this , eavesdropping ?
four to 15 years .
zach was holding a cell phone in his hand .
he ... where is zach ?
he &apos;s at home .
but we have to appear tomorrow for the preliminary hearing .
and why is mr. gardner not standing with you ?
i was suspended from the law for six months , your honor .
that suspension ends this week ,
then i &apos;ll be fighting alongside miss lockhart
to restore our firm to its former glory .
could you talk to your friend at madison county ,
get this cop &apos;s record , see if there &apos;s any disciplinary action .
they &apos;re not gonna pursue this , alicia .
okay ? don &apos;t worry .
the cop just wanted to make a point .
it &apos;s on zach &apos;s record .
he &apos;s looking at colleges .
okay .
i &apos;ll give my friend a call .
thank you .
no , mr. gardner ,
if this were before the dewey &amp; leboeuf bankruptcy ,
i &apos;d probably approve this plan ,
but i see the same management problems here
of excessive debt and compensation .
your honor , no one wins
if you liquidate us .
i would agree ,
but your plan doesn &apos;t address the management issues .
but we &apos;re management .
yes , i know .
why are we being punished for dewey &amp; leboeuf ?
we have to get the partners together .
oh , no .
a new client , i forgot .
we can &apos;t be turning down new business .
cary and alicia , we need you to take this meeting .
what is it ?
it &apos;s not one of our most prestigious cases .
i own a tow truck company .
okay , and , uh , how may we help you with that , mr. saverese ?
nick .
so what , i don &apos;t get the partners anymore ?
oh , no ,
uh , diane and will just asked us to get some detail .
detail , sure . okay , well , i got a lot of detail .
i &apos;m new to town ,
and the government is putting out an rfp
to outsource its tow truck service ,
but they won &apos;t let me bid .
why not ?
well , i &apos;ve had a bit of a problem in my past .
it &apos;s nothing big , you know ,
it &apos;s just , uh , just an arrest .
nick , let me stop you right there .
you don &apos;t want to tell us anything
that might preclude us from working on your case .
do you need to go ?
no . i &apos;m fine .
well , here &apos;s the thing .
i have two businessmen who want to partner with me on this bid .
i supply the service , they act as middlemen .
so , i need your firm to vet them and help me choose one .
alicia ?
alicia .
so , how is that legal ?
how is ...
he wants to partner with
someone who doesn &apos;t have an arrest record
so he can make a bid on a governmental contract .
yes , and as long as we keep the bid at arm &apos;s length , we &apos;re fine .
look , if we weren &apos;t in such bad straights ,
we &apos;d probably cut this one loose , but ...
no , i get it .
i just , uh , i still have one leg in the sa &apos;s office .
and how long have you and your husband been separated ?
about a year .
so , you were separated when you stood beside him
for his gubernatorial announcement ?
yes .
and you didn &apos;t find this hypocritical ?
no .
you seem to prefer one @-@ word answers .
yes .
your husband said that you are working on mending fences .
is that true ?
it is .
can you expand on that ?
my husband slept with prostitutes .
that made our marriage difficult .
but we have children together
and my husband apologized ,
and i needed time to consider whether to accept that apology .
during that time , we separated .
but now you &apos;re together ?
we &apos;re mending fences .
do you live in his house ?
i have my own apartment ,
but i also sometimes stay at his house .
in the same room ?
that &apos;s none of your business .
why not ?
because my life is mine .
but you &apos;ve made your life public ,
haven &apos;t you ?
no .
my husband has .
so , i &apos;d like to ask you this ,
alicia , why do you stay with your husband ?
why not divorce ?
other wives who &apos;ve been betrayed like you have divorced .
because i don &apos;t want to .
isn &apos;t that setting a bad example to women everywhere
to be such a doormat ?
peggy .
i like my husband .
i respect him .
he &apos;s flawed , but i &apos;ve grown to accept that .
and i committed to a marriage .
i don &apos;t like breaking commitments .
isn &apos;t that dragging women back to the &apos; 50s ?
women have all the obligation ,
men have all the freedom .
i don &apos;t know .
this isn &apos;t about women or the &apos; 50s .
this is about me .
仪表盘摄像头
hey , there . how &apos;s it going ?
good .
can i see your driver &apos;s license , registration ...
come on , drey .
here you go .
get it , boy . there you go . get it , boy .
what do you got , drey ?
okay , you know how you &apos;re not supposed to shop when you &apos;re hungry , hmm ?
well , it &apos;s just as important not to do interviews
when you &apos;re pissed .
i wasn &apos;t pissed , eli .
and if you don &apos;t want me doing interviews ...
what i want is for you to stay on message .
kresteva is making this all about family .
and what &apos;s the message about our separation ?
you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;ll set up a meeting to discuss it .
oh , and i need you to talk
to the cwa next thursday .
i work , eli .
i &apos;ll talk to will and diane . no .
i want to work , eli .
peter &apos;s free tomorrow night .
we &apos;ll discuss it then .
what &apos;s that ?
good boy .
what &apos;s that ? get that . get it , boy .
dig for it .
what do you got , drey ?
oh , hey , kalinda ,
you have a friend who trains canines , don &apos;t you ?
yeah , why ?
i think i was subject to a bogus search .
can i talk to him ?
her . sure .
what about our bonuses ?
the judge approved the plan .
that &apos;s the important thing ; we avoided liquidation .
but ...
i thought you were leaving us , david .
and miss this ? are you kidding ?
we avoided liquidation , but the judge assigned
a trustee to supervise our decisions .
wait , wait .
everybody will still get paid .
everybody will still work on cases ,
but new cases will be vetted by this trustee .
meaning he can veto you .
in theory , but he hasn &apos;t been assigned to us yet ,
so we don &apos;t know .
excuse me .
our hope is that this trustee
will work closely with us and that he or she
will have as much invested in our success as we do .
excuse me ?
i &apos;m clarke hayden .
yes ?
the trustee .
and the paintings , are they leased ?
no , we own them .
but the office furniture is leased ?
yes .
mr. hayden ,
if i could be so bold .
we have a fairly refined clientele ,
and if we start dressing down the office ,
they &apos;ll notice and leave us .
i think that &apos;s enough for today .
what i thought i would do is meet
with you both separately
to discuss the current staffing situation .
uh , what current staffing situation ?
reduction .
that &apos;s from my personal collection .
it &apos;s pretty .
thanks .
do you think we &apos;ve hit bottom yet ?
nope .
hey , mom , did you know you can videotape a cop ,
you just can &apos;t audiotape them ?
did they teach that at school ?
no , it &apos;s an old law based on taping phone calls .
you had to have both parties agree to record a call .
what are you reading ?
oh , it &apos;s a web site about my rights .
it &apos;s actually pretty cool . yeah .
looks like some pretty cool stuff .
缓解 + 慰藉
i &apos;m not looking at that .
here , look .
this is the e @-@ mail that i sent myself .
i had my phone set to bluetooth
so i could play music in the car ,
and i never switched it back .
okay .
well , look .
this is what i shot .
but listen .
it &apos;s a lovely song .
can we stop it now ?
yes , your honor .
my son never recorded audio ,
and there can be no article 14 violation without audio .
therefore , we ask this court to enter a finding
of no probable cause .
that sounds right to me ,
asa williams .
your honor ,
sorry to take over here . asa altman .
uh , we would argue that the problem here
was never article 14 , it was obstruction of justice .
excuse me , your honor , but that wasn &apos;t the charge .
yes , but we would ask
leave of the court to file an additional charge .
your honor , this is outrageous .
the only one obstructing justice
is officer robb with his illegal traffic stop .
your honor , i know mrs. florrick isn &apos;t from this county ,
but we take unfounded charges like that very seriously .
yes , we do .
do you have any evidence to that effect ,
mrs. florrick ?
i can gather it .
then gather it .
and before i hear on the obstruction of justice charge ,
i will hear on the legality of the traffic stop .
this is about my husband , isn &apos;t it ?
excuse me ?
you want to embarrass my husband
by going after my son ?
mrs. florrick , i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve met .
i &apos;m the state &apos;s attorney for madison county , phil tapia .
i don &apos;t go after people .
my son is 17 years old .
he has nothing to do with politics .
you want to hurt peter ,
i &apos;ll give you his number .
maybe you can do me the honor , mrs. florrick ,
of talking to me like i &apos;m not some small @-@ town hood .
my son did nothing wrong .
he obstructed justice .
after an illegal traffic stop .
well , that will be a hard one to prove .
i have to go now .
and you might tell your husband ...
... police love their pensions .
so , am i in trouble ?
not if i can help it .
come on .
petey ?
so the issue isn &apos;t the dog , and it &apos;s not the trainer .
the issue is the handler .
so , the handler can force a false positive ?
the point is , petey doesn &apos;t need to be encouraged .
he &apos;ll alert without prompting .
now , if i wanted to create a false positive ....
let &apos;s go .
find it . where is it ?
where is it ?
where is it ?
find it . what &apos;s in there , petey ?
what &apos;s in there ? see ?
i just found probable cause to search through your file box .
get it , boy . dig for it .
what do you got , drey ?
what &apos;s in there ? what &apos;s in there ?
that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s a manufactured false positive .
thank you very much .
yeah .
excuse me .
you see , i &apos;m a good person .
i never said you weren &apos;t .
my dogs miss you .
you know , i never liked the way they looked at me .
there was always something a little bit ...
what ?
what is it ?
so ...
both are stable businessmen .
no liens on credit , financially secure .
but due to preferential hiring in government bids ,
we would suggest partnering with mr. wells .
&apos;cause he &apos;s black ?
yes .
and who did the vetting for you ?
who ? our investigator .
can i talk to him ?
i got a few questions . just details .
her , and ... sure , yeah .
she just took off .
um , actually , she stepped out for the moment ,
but i &apos;m sure we can answer any questions you have .
no . i like to hear from the horse &apos;s mouth .
when will she be back ?
i don &apos;t know . soon .
well ,
let &apos;s set another appointment .
it &apos;s just a few more billable hours , right ?
so ?
you like that , huh ?
what does will bring to the table ?
what does will , my partner ?
yes .
everything .
i guess i don &apos;t understand the question .
i &apos;m starting at the top with these interviews and continuing down .
i want to get a sense of how things work .
well , will is the heart and soul of litigation .
not for the last six months .
yes .
he &apos;s been suspended ,
which is one of the reasons we &apos;re struggling now .
you talk about him like he &apos;s a trial lawyer ,
not a partner .
just so we know here .
will &apos;s partnership is essential to this firm .
wouldn &apos;t it be better
if only one person was deciding ?
no . don &apos;t answer yet .
i want you to think about it .
a lot of my staffing decisions will depend on it .
you guys ready to go to dad &apos;s ?
yup .
um , i &apos;m just taking this &apos; cause it &apos;s easier ,
and my room &apos;s empty at dad &apos;s house anyway , so ...
mom , did you get the names of the other people
pulled over by that cop ?
not yet . i think the sa &apos;s office is freezing us out . why ?
i got a few names .
really ?
where did you find them ?
online .
there &apos;s a web site where people share stories
about police abuse , and i asked if anyone had difficulties
with an officer robb on interstate 55,
and three people responded .
here &apos;s their numbers .
zach , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m really impressed .
i will call these tomorrow .
actually , i ...
you already called them ?
skyped them .
this one guy had his car impounded
for having a single joint in his ashtray .
and someone else had $ 10,000 taken .
money for a down payment ,
but officer robb suspected it of being drug money .
it &apos;s a forfeiture corridor .
the police department makes money off of drug forfeitures .
they stop out @-@ of @-@ town cars , check for drugs ,
and then impound them if they find anything .
mom , dad &apos;s here .
zach , i ... i think i have to say this again .
i &apos;m really impressed .
eli , can we have a minute alone ?
don &apos;t you think we should do this together ?
no , no , it &apos;s okay .
but i need to know what events you &apos;ll do together ,
or they &apos;re gonna ask whether you live together ...
no . just ... just a minute alone .
sorry about that .
life under the microscope .
i don &apos;t want the kids doing events , peter .
i know .
eli is going to insist .
kresteva is putting his son front and center .
i know .
no kids .
good .
thanks .
so do we ?
live together .
what did you tell the reporter ?
&quot; none of your business . &quot;
i think we should probably say
that we &apos;re working on it .
are we ?
well , in the sense that nothing &apos;s definitive , yes .
why ?
just helps to know the truth .
i need to tell you something ,
because i think it involves you now .
i want to help out with the campaign .
no .
he said what ?
he said , &quot; the police like their pensions . &quot;
and i told him that if he wanted to come after you ,
he should leave our son alone .
peter , i &apos;m handling it .
i don &apos;t want to make things worse , okay ?
don &apos;t do anything .
you met with the trustee ?
what did he say ?
he wanted to know my thoughts on how to reduce staff .
that &apos;s it ?
no . he ...
he asked whether to drop you as a name partner .
he wondered whether you were more important as a litigator ,
and whether i should make all the decisions .
yeah , he said the same thing to me .
what ?
our friend clarke seems to have learned
his management skills from mao .
what did he say ?
i &apos;m the true litigator .
the firm has suffered through your leadership
over the last six months .
now it needs a man at the top .
he didn &apos;t say , &quot; a man . &quot;
no .
i added that to piss you off .
we need to get out from under this .
but we need to make $ 60 million in five months .
which we can &apos;t do .
not without david lee .
you have a problem with my stand on pensions ,
you come to me .
your son was pulled over .
that &apos;s all . i &apos;m following the law .
that &apos;s right . same way i will with your son
at the university of chicago .
so we &apos;re threatening each other now ?
no . i &apos;m threatening you .
and here &apos;s a handy little cheat sheet
for the next time you forget .
i &apos;m the state &apos;s attorney of a county that actually matters , jackass !
what do you want ?
three things .
drop the case , expunge the arrest ,
and tell that stupid son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ bitch of a traffic cop
to call my son and apologize .
give me a day .
i did it . it &apos;s done .
i don &apos;t want to hear about it .
you miss this .
don &apos;t flatter yourself .
why were you at my work ?
business .
what business ?
oh , you know , expanding .
becoming the tycoon .
were you robbed ?
i knew you were coming , so i put everything into storage .
what ? my money , too ?
so you don &apos;t love me anymore .
i want you gone .
what about dinner tomorrow ?
nick ... i want you gone .
from chicago forever .
yeah , with you .
you &apos;re coming home .
no , i &apos;m not coming .
i forgive you , okay ?
i just can &apos;t stay angry at you .
well , things have changed .
you see this ?
it &apos;s my new tattoo .
that is the midnight sun ,
and i got it for you .
means &quot; new beginning . &quot;
it &apos;s over .
you know why it &apos;s not over .
you could &apos;ve run .
you knew i was coming ...
but you stayed .
will . hi . is everything okay ?
yeah . how you doing ?
good .
i &apos;ve just been ...
well , we &apos;ve been running around in separate worlds .
we have .
well , if there &apos;s anything i can do ...
you were interviewed by a reporter a few days ago ?
yes . peggy byrne .
right . is there anything i should know about that ?
about my interview ? no .
she wants to talk to me .
to you ?
she wants to know how we ...
work together .
well , she ... i don &apos;t think ...
she probably just wants a fuller picture .
yes .
i suggested she talk to diane , but ...
she said she wanted me .
well , i don &apos;t think that she ...
knows about us ?
yes .
we were ... pretty careful .
it &apos;s probably nothing .
well , back to it .
did you have a dog here yesterday ?
yes . long story .
hey , your suspension ends tonight , doesn &apos;t it ?
it does .
welcome back .
thanks .
uh , will ?
i wonder if you shouldn &apos;t talk to her .
the reporter ? i was gonna blow her off .
too busy .
probably best .
don &apos;t worry .
i got it .
i &apos;m out the door .
i know .
so this interview is a bit pointless ,
unless you want me to tell you
where all the bodies are buried .
so , what do you want ?
you &apos;re one of our creditors now .
your creditor ?
i like to identify with the firm .
well , then yes , i am owed $ 1 million for my capital contribution ,
my yearly draw is five percent ,
and so i am owed approximately $ 3 million .
hm . it &apos;s good that you &apos;re leaving , then .
&quot; it &apos;s good . &quot; what do you mean ?
it &apos;s less of a burden .
five cents on the dollar makes it $ 150,000 .
no . i was a partner-- first money in is first money out .
mm @-@ hmm , for partners--
but you &apos;ll be a creditor .
so thank you .
wait a minute .
i &apos;ll be a creditor in name only .
i put up the capital contribution .
yes , and thank you . good luck .
wait .
80 cents on the dollar .
mr. lee , you misunderstand me .
i &apos;m not negotiating .
you &apos;ll get five cents on the dollar ,
and you &apos;ll get it last--
after we pay off the lease , the furniture , the bottled water delivery ,
then we &apos;ll get to you .
why ?
i don &apos;t like people who quit .
what do you got , drey ? what &apos;s in there ?
what &apos;s in there ? good , boy .
your honor , officer robb creates false positives in order to
search cars for drugs ...
what does this have to do with obstruction of justice , your honor ?
there was no obstruction ,
there was only an illegal impounding of my son &apos;s cell phone .
oh , come on .
this section of the interstate is a forfeiture corridor ,
a place where the police and the state &apos;s attorney , phil tapia ,
make their money from the war on drugs
by illegally impounding cars and cash .
we have witnesses who haven &apos;t received their cars and cash back
after stops by officer robb .
maybe it &apos;s not a problem in mrs. florrick &apos;s county ,
but we have a drug problem in madison county .
then why are all these stops
being made on the north @-@ running side ?
my son checked these traffic stops
resulting in drug searches .
over the last six months ,
90 % of them were made on the north @-@ running side of the highway .
why is that important ?
because all the drugs are coming from the canadian border
down the south @-@ running side .
and all the money made from these drug sales heads up the north .
they &apos;re not trying to stop drugs .
they &apos;re trying to confiscate the money
made from these drug sales .
that is an outrageous lie , your honor .
mr. state &apos;s attorney ...
your honor , these are very serious allegations .
that &apos;s putting it lightly .
and we intend to refute them .
we ask for a trial date
to give us time to prepare .
for what ? for the obstruction of justice charge ,
or for the impounding ?
the obstruction charge , of course .
we can do this .
together we can do it .
thank you for coming out .
you send your wife against me ?
what ?
you think cook county is above our problems ?
get off my bus .
you came after my forfeiture corridor .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
we are coming after your son to the fullest extent of the law .
you want to come after my corridor , i &apos;ll come after yours .
my guess is your haul on i @-@ 94 is ten times what mine is .
and i &apos;m not the one running for governor .
i just want to say i decided to stay .
you &apos;ve shown me loyalty ; i want to show you the same in return .
can &apos;t wait to get started .
just wanted to tell you ,
i &apos;m staying . talk to you later .
did you ... ?
yes . what happened ?
what ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe mao &apos;s not so bad if he works for you .
kalinda .
hmm ?
you okay ?
yeah . good .
we have another meeting with that new client .
um , could you sit in ? he &apos;s got some questions about the vetting .
the new client ?
mr. tow truck saverese .
he asked for you yesterday , but you stepped out .
he &apos;ll be in in an hour .
wow , you are really somewhere else today .
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll sit in .
okay , good .
hey . good job with the video .
i would have never thought of that .
what ? what video ?
the one online about your traffic stop .
smart , like &quot; breakfast in collinsville . &quot;
... a ticket and a warning at this time and let you go .
so , if there &apos;s nothing ...
meet officer robb .
a four @-@ year veteran
of the madison county police department ,
and a real putz .
could i see your driver &apos;s license , registration , proof of insurance ?
what &apos;d we do wrong ?
it turns out we did nothing wrong--
except get stopped by officer robb .
* good morning , here &apos;s the news *
* and all of it is good *
* and the weather &apos;s good ! *
hello ?
this is officer curtis robb .
is this zachary florrick ?
yes .
i wanted to say ...
i &apos;m sorry ...
about pulling you over .
i was wrong .
really ?
yeah , i think we &apos;re dropping the case ,
and expunging your arrest .
and ... that &apos;s it .
okay ?
okay .
great .
i &apos;m going now .
500,000 views ? really ?
kids .
hi . i &apos;m kitty , and i &apos;m ready-- to talk ...
i &apos;ve , uh , given it some thought .
i need will .
it can &apos;t be just one partner .
lockhart &amp; associates ?
no .
we &apos;re a team .
all right .
then come tomorrow ready to work .
we have to cut 30 % from the staff .
ready ?
